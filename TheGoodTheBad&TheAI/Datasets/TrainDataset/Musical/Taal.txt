A promise...
should never give be given to anyone
lf ever given...
that promise should never be broken
Never break a promise
Someone's hand...
should never be held
lf ever...
that hand should never leave yours
To the clouds...
l want to soar
Like a kite...
l want to fly
Then a stranger will come...
to take you away as his bride
l'll defy every norm
l won't leave my father's house
Never defy destiny
Hush, say nothing
Never...
make promises
lf ever...
then never break your promise
Tarababu...
the girls are growing up. Your school
is surviving on government grants
And your brother does nothing.
You have old debts to pay
For all the wedding songs you sing,
do you ever think about...
your daughters, their weddings?
- What can l do?
Use your connections in government.
There are so many property disputes!
Make a killing.
- Forever the broker...
How many times must l tell you,
l'm an artiste not a broker.
The art is all l know and of art
l'll make a living, not out of bribes.
Eat a carrot.
Obeisances.
- Bless you
Has everyone reached safely?
- Yes
Rambhajan, what's going on?
After 5 years of running after
a 100 acre-contract in Chamba...
we still don't possess the land?
- lt's not like what it was
The government changed,
and everything changed
The project is worth Rs.10 billion and
l've pumped in 600 million already
Deals have been finalised
with international companies
lf the government reneges,
we stand to lose Rs.6 billion
Your brother is here
Come here, kids!
- Uncle...
How have you been?
Give me a kiss
Hello, brother.
- Hello, brother-in-Law
Do you like Chamba?
- There's something about Chamba
Lady, are enjoying it or not?
- Yes. But not like Scotland
And you, Janki...?
- No opinions
Happiness for a brother
is happiness for a sister
Where's Manav?
- He is in Delhi
Why? He didn't come with you?
- l said, come. But he said, carry on
He'll be travelling alone.
- Strange. His first lndia tour
And he wants to travel alone?
- He doesn't obey you
and you think he will listen to us?
- Said he'd take in lndia on his way
Our most sought-after man
is standing here! Come on
Put the files in the car.
We're going to the commissioner
Good morning uncle.
- Good morning. Where were you?
Anyway now that you're here,
you can work on this project
Your father is cross.
He's waiting for you
Would Mr. Manav know
how a father aches for a son?
Dad...
- Welcome, sir
Welcome to Chamba
Never mind, your apologies
are accepted
l know Your Highness,
what you are about to say
And what will l say?
- You'll say Manav my son,...
not for Daddy's sake but
do spare a thought for yourself
Such a long journey, all alone?
Your first trip to lndia from London
You could've gotten lost.
You could've been robbed, kidnapped
What if?
But nothing of the sort happened.
Nothing happened, Dad
To tell the truth...
- l know, what you're about to say
You'll say...
lf you want to see lndia, don't
watch Her out of a helicopter
Get into a second class railway coach,
in ramshackle buses, in stuffy lanes
Observe the lndian succeeding in doing
nothing, and yet he smiles, he sings
And Chamba is the best
That's why l picked up this latest
Digital Floppy camera from Singapore
Your Brownie...
he missed you the most
Go. He's very annoyed with you
Did you follow that father-son lingo?
Shut up.
- As always
Brownie...
Mad at me?
Sorry l'm late
Won't you forgive me?
Coming for a walk?
No...?
l'm going.
lf you want, come along
Wonderful?
Shall we snap a photo?
Only the minister can
approve this project
Who can make him do it?
- Only one man, sir
His childhood friend. Tarababu.
- Then rope him in
He is a very proud man. Tried my best
to do him in, but he won't relent
Whoever...?
Wherever...
wherever you are...
l'm coming
My heart, restless...
l gaze upon the pathway
With an anxious heart
l gaze upon the pathways
Life's so boring,
bereft of music
Come to me, my love...
let's make music
together
Rains drench me
l feel an anguish
A feeling, l wonder...
l have lost something...
but what have l lost?
Don't stay mum,
say something
Come dance with me
fall in step with me...
let's make music together
l do not know you
You do not know me
Let's get to know each other,
come into my heart...
just for the sake of our hearts
l feel whatever you feel
Come, let's share our feelings
Let's make music
together
Truss up the rope.
Tie it around your waist
My name is Manav Mehta.
Manav Kumar Mehta
From London.
What a way to meet!
May l have this picture of yours?
Buy your vegetables
Mr. Brownie, have you ever
seen such a sight?
Tarababu. That's who l am.
This is uncivilised
You'll deal with me!
- What happened?
His son was falling off the hill.
My girls rescued him
The cheek! He took their pictures!
Tell me Mr. Brigadier...
if your daughter was photographed
on the sly by a stranger...
while she's playing, bathing
in the rains, what would you do?
l'd shoot him!
- And that's what l want to do
ls gate-crashing into a party
civilised?
And you're armed with a stick!
lf this isn't bullying, what is?
Madam! You stand in Chamba!
You may be rich. But don't take me on
Tarababu...
l am Deep Mohan,
l'm the second in this family
lf our boy has made a mistake,
we apologise with folded hands
Bring your son here
- The elders are apologising
Don't be angry.
- lt's our son's birthday
Won't you bless him?
- Yes, bless you
Son, greet the uncle.
- Namaste uncle
Give him a kiss. Go on...
- Bless you
Tell your son that he should return
any indelicate photos
Now l'll take your leave.
- Tarababu, do stay for the party
No, l'm leaving
He forgot his stick.
Good day. l'm Manav Mehta
- Good day.
Your stick... you left it at my home
l see...
So you're the errant prince...?
- l made the mistake of taking pictures
l'm here to apologise.
- You hail from a good family
Return the photos you took
Here you are.
- What's this wafer?
l want the round thing you
put in the camera... reel..?
No, this is a floppy. This camera
uses a floppy... no reel system
What?
Let me take a picture of yours
Forget it...
You keep it. We don't understand
computers. But henceforth you...
l don't need photos.
You are such beautiful people
The image is burnt right in my heart.
- What...?
May l take your leave?
Nice guy
That's what these artists are
Passionate, emotional, sentimental
But Tarababu is annoyed with us.
- But Deep handled him very well
But mind, the Goddesses of
wealth and learning don't get along
They'll make wonderful music together.
- How come?
l got an idea.
Tomorrow morning...
take us to Tarababu's house.
Then watch what l do
You...
- Tarababu...
l am Jagmohan.
The eldest brother in the family
l'm Manav's father. We're here
to apologise for Manav's impertinence
Good Lord! Please forget it. l didn't
realise the matter would drag this far
Never imagined such wealthy
people can be so humble
Last night Rambhajan told me about you.
So rich, yet so simple
You know? He has lunched with
Prime Ministers
And your picture appears
on front-pages?
No matter how famous
the worshippers of wealth...
we're still bow before
the priests of art
No, l'm a petty singer
from the country... folk singer
Tarababu... this simplicity
is what draws us
l am really ashamed for
my misbehaviour that last evening
Sorry, really sorry
l'll accept your apology only
if you accept our little gift
Gift...?
Unveil it
You have infused our hermitage
as if with Soul
The Goddess has come home to me
l am Santram.
- l see...
Consultant
- l see
l am Brijmohan.
l hope you liked the idol
Much
So where were we?
... yes, yoga
Manasi.
- Coming
Take the class till l return
Baba... what is it?
- Come dear, let me introduce you
Look, all the way from Bombay,
they brought for us this idol
The Goddess of Knowledge
My only child, Manasi.
My only, yet she scolds me
l forgot to introduce my family.
My brother Balwant, my sister-in-law
and their daughters
And my disciples.
Together, we make wonderful music
Well written
The rhythm in the song
is soul to music
ln the rhythm in your breath
find love's soul
Wonderful!
- My daughter composed it
My child, you composed this?
- Yes
Tarababu...
- Yes?
l have a request.
l'm hosting a party tonight
My guests are coming from Delhi.
l'd like you to come
Your presence
will add a feather to my cap
How can l refuse you?
- What about Mania's wedding?
Oh yes. The rest of you can go there.
Manasi and l will go to their house...
for dinner
This is Mr. Jindal,
the CEO of Zee TV
Tarababu sings beautifully
l'd like you to showcase his talent
through your channel
Aunt, how much does
my balloon weigh?
Your balloon...weighs...
The balloon scared you?
So it was your prank?
- No, the kids
You may think of me as a child.
- That's apparent
He...? He's my heart. My sweetheart.
Brownie is my friend. Say hello
Don't you have friends?
- No. My relatives are my friends
l too have so many of them.
My Papa, my grannie in Bombay
Would you like to meet her?
- lf you introduce me
Hold him.
One minute. Stay here.
l'll be back
l too get one picture
with the big boss
l'm privileged to be
photographed with you
Welcome
Tarababu's daughter, aren't you?
As soon as you entered
you make friends with the dog
That's called a smart girl
Sorry, l took a while. Come
And she's striking relations
Tarababu, whenever you're in Bombay
you must stay with us
My second cousin lives in Bombay.
She's a television reporter.
Prabha Shankar, from Mumbai
The way she speaks!
Look, my Grannie
My only friend who knows me
through and through
Have you seen Manav?
- Yes
Where is he?
- He's... gone
You teach yoga very well
Will you teach me?
- Sure
But...you will have
to become my student
Definitely
Nice band, no?
Will you do something for me?
- Yes?
My friend, Mania is getting married.
Baba dragged me here
And you want to be
at your friend's party?
Yes Shanno, lla...
everyone is there
Will you give me a lift?
l'll be seeing you.
- Seeing me...? Why?
To learn yoga
Sure.
- Promise?
Promise.
- Sure?
Not sure
Manasi! We thought you won't come.
We've been waiting for so long!
How could l not come?
- You must sing today
You must!
- You sing
No, you first.
- You sing, l won't
l'll begin. But you must sing.
- Come on...
lf not for love...
what's left to die for?
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?
Love's sweet
And bittersweet
A promise to be kept... love
A tie between lovers... love
lf not for love...
what's left to die for?
Love on Earth,
God in Heaven
Between Heaven and Earth
lies life
Say it in a hundred words...
yet it means the same
God, most beautiful... love
More beautiful than God... love
What love is, who has ever known?
What love is, who doesn't know?
Myriad are the paths
in the City of Love...
but which leads to my lover?
The journey may be long
Yet you set out at such a tender age,
looking for love, what is love...?
Pain, or salve for the suffering?
ls it love or God Himself?
ls love God?
lf not for love...
what's left to die for?
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?
You only heard of love
l have loved
lt's Eden
lt's strewn with thorns
lf not for love...
what's left to die for?
lf not for love,
what's left to live for?
Love's sweet
And bittersweet
What's going on?
See...?
Come on
Remember last night's promise?
About teaching me yoga?
Here l am
Raise your arms, both
Lift
Turn
Bend
Over
Stretch
Look Manav, this isn't happening
This won't happen.
- What won't happen?
You know what l mean
We're two different people.
- Yes. So?
We are two different people.
And two people meet
Have you ever seen the
mountains and valleys together?
The earth, the sky...
- Are you in love with them?
What...?
- Are you in love?
Manav, listen...
hear me out, try to understand
Girls in my family do not
fall in love. My circle...
consists only of my parents
and my sisters
Understandable.
- You and l are different
l am responsible for my Baba.
Only l understand his pathos
l don't want to add to his sorrows.
- Granted
Period. So get this.
There's nothing between us
How can l do that? There is.
- What is...?
We're falling in love.
- You are very stubborn
l'm also honest..
- So for the last time...
take an honest answer from me.
l'm not in love with you. Okay?
Not okay
l can't believe this.
- Because l refused point blank?
No, you got scared.
- Of whom?
Of me. l might
cheat you and run away
Look... don't try your magic on me.
- So there is a magic in me?
l'll never see you again! Never
Long live our Minister!
- Long live
l'm grateful to the world famous
Mehta family forjoining our efforts...
for the development
of Himachal Pradesh
First of all l'd like to thank
Tarababu, a childhood friend of mine
Tarababu, the pride of Chamba.
Even in the face of abject poverty...
he has never discarded
his ideals
Yes, my first trip to lndia.
- Manav...
Cold drink?
See that girl in the grey scarf?
- Yes...?
Take this to her. Go on
All this was possible
thanks to you
Soft drink, for you.
- No thanks
Excuse me...
Give that to me. Take another one.
- Why...?
l'm thirsty
Wait...
What are you doing here?
Come and meet the minister
l'll join you
Thrice l asked you to come on stage.
You never heard me? Come on
Let's go
Now you understand?
- l see
Tomorrow we're leaving for Bombay
l knew. You'd come
and you'd come here
Now tell me
you don't love me
Say it. Go on
Why are you silent?
Oh it's nothing
l know what you're thinking.
- What...?
Right out of a Hindi movie.
Boy from the city goes to the hills
Falls in love with a girl.
Then he deserts her
And then?
- He never returns
But... that will never happen.
This is no movie, this is reality
This is my life.
Of course...
there will be resistance.
l got to face my family
And you with your family
But it'll work out
Manav
Got to leave.
- Listen, Manav...
l embroidered this for you...
But that's mine!
- Now it belongs to us both. Look
What's Manav-si?
- Means... like Manav
Manasi... just like Manav
Thank you very much, Tarababu.
Do meet us if you come to Bombay
You must take care of your health.
- You too
See that temple?
- Yes?
lt's said that the God of that temple
grants every wish. Will you come?
l don't go to temples.
- What...?
Never been to one
l won't stop you if you want to go.
- l don't understand
When l was eleven, Mummy died.
She always told me...
Manav, God lives in your heart
Here. ln my conscience
After all what is God?
A belief, the truth
Man gives Him many forms.
A book, an idol, the flame of a lamp
l see God in me. That's all
Your love too is a faith in me.
- Yes, it's a faith
As a token of that faith, l bought
you something from the temple shop
Want to take a look?
lt's cheap. Made of stones
But hundred percent genuine
Show me how it looks
Who gave you this necklace?
Who gave it?
You love your Baba, don't you?
You love me?
- Baba, wait...
Before you say anything
before you misunderstand me...
l want to tell you everything.
Manav gave that to me
Why? What for?
- Because he loves me dearly
And you...?
- Me too
Are you in your senses?
Do you know who he is?
They are very wealthy people!
We have nothing in common
But l'm concerned with Manav.
Not with rich people
This is impossible!
lmpossible
l'm Manav. From Bombay
Why are you sounding worried?
Situation tense?
Baba... Manasi...
He has come to know?
All right, put him on the line.
- Baba... Manav, for you
l'm sorry l couldn't meet you before
leaving, wanted to talk, but l couldn't
l'm glad you found out that l...
are you listening?
Yes, l'm listening. Go on.
- l was saying...
the promise l made to Manasi
before l left... is firm
l will marry Manasi.
That's my commitment and l will keep it
As her father, you must be worried,
you must be angry with Manasi
ln your place, l'd probably do the same.
But don't worry
God be with me,
l'm resolute
Everything will be fine
Your father is an artiste.
Who else can understand love better?
Manav, call me later. Please
Where have you been? l've been going
Manav-Manav. And not a reply?
Another twist to Manav's love story.
Manasi's father has found out...
that Manasi loves me.
l mean, that we're in love
Forget about love and
look at this photo
She's the girl Deep Mohan and Shaku
have chosen for you
l told her father clearly.
l'll keep my promise
But Jagmohan has decided otherwise.
Nikita is from the Kurasia family
l approve. She has class.
- Grannie, this is not fair
You've sat through my story
and yet no sign of sympathy?
lt's pack up for all these girls.
- Sympathies are only for the obedient
You will marry the girl
l approve of
No, Grannie. This isn't fair.
You're putting me into a corner
l got this melodrama up and running.
You want me to stage another drama?
You're my grannie!
How can you do this to me? Unfair
At least take a look
at the photo
When in love, never fall.
Rise, my child
You... here?
- The girls are worried about you
l went to call Prabha
- Bombay?
Prabha the only one
l have in Bombay
What did she advise?
- What can she say?
She asked me to take Manasi
over to Bombay
She wants to talk to Manasi
before she finds a solution
She also said not to inform Jaggi.
l'm worried
Are you going to Bombay?
l can't spend another night here.
l must go to Bombay
So here you are in Bombay,
at least on this pretext
Where is Ashwin?
- l divorced him
Why?
- He deserved it
But l got a memento from him.
My Tunna
Your story leads me
to one conclusion
At seven tomorrow morning
surprise Manav Mehta
l told you. Mr. Mehta doesn't
meet anybody on Sundays
Tell him l've come from Chamba.
l'm Tarababu. l'm a close friend
l have orders not to wake up
anyone before 9.30
Take a seat on this bench.
l'll find out after 9.30 or 10
l'm not going to sit here!
l'm his friend
Only his friends come here.
Sit down
Take a seat
Baba, let's sit
One Tarababu from Chamba.
- Let him sit outside
Sit here
Sit
We won't sit here.
- Why?
May l talk on the telephone?
To Mr. Mehta or his son...?
Mr. Mehta is asleep.
His son isn't in
He went to his grandmother
last night
Sit
Brownie...
Come here
Your name's Brownie, right?
- You know him?
Yes and he recognises me too
You see? He knows us!
l'll fix you later
Hello. Shake hands, pal.
Handshake, no?
l'm sure he'll go
and tell Jagmohan
Lock him in the room
Creating a nuisance
all morning
l'll talk to him
Deep...
We have come.
- Tarababu, when did you come?
When? Been here since 7.30! The guard
is a rascal... didn't he tell you?
We've been waiting for 6 hours
And tell me where is Jagmohan?
- He's getting dressed
We have guests from London.
He has a luncheon meeting with them
Please be seated. l'll inform him.
- We've waited all day...
Let them sit under the awning
You may sit here.
- Now we sit here
Would you like some tea?
Water if you please.
- Right away
You've made them sit here?
They aren't non-entities.
Dear friends of my brother-in-law
Tarababu from Chamba, right from
the lap of the Himalayas
Let them enjoy the air conditioned
comfort of the waiting lounge
You came without an appointment?
- Well sister, we...
You heard what she had to say?
Didn't l tell you...?
Call them up, take a appointment.
- What appointment?
When they came to our house,
did they ask for an appointment?
What a melodrama
No, Baba. Let's leave
Of course we will leave. But not
before we've seen the end of this
Why do street performers come to
the Mehtas? For staging a melodrama?
What...?
- The daughter is dolled-up
To inveigle the prince...?
- My sister, you are...
l'm not a sister to pimps like you!
You better go home
Not until l've met Mr. Jagmohan.
- He's in a luncheon meeting
What will you do there?
Wag your tail like a dog?
l must tell Mr. Jagmohan that this
anglicised witch belongs in his kennels
You called me a bitch!
How dare you?
Throw them out!
Tarababu...
- Brother... for hours...
Stop! Stop right there!
He called me a bitch
Did he say it or not?
- He did
You drop in uninvited and then
you call my sister-in-law...
A witch! Yes, l called her a witch!
Because of her misbehaviour
Yes, Tarababu from Chamba.
Your friend, you brother
Go ahead, give it to me
You aren't in the right frame
of mind. Go home now.
See me in my offices tomorrow.
- There! So you said it too?
Yes, l have spoken
Won't even offer his friend a seat,
not even a glass of water! Wonderful!
My very guests who honoured me with
the idol of the goddess of Knowledge
And those lofty talks!
Of godliness manifest in art,
nobler than wealth
Bit too sentimental, aren't you?
Artistes, troubadours, all the same
They come wagging their tails
at the sight of currency
Knowledge-worship, that's a sham.
You slave to Wealth
You drool at the sight of cash,
for all that big talk
lf you want to be compensated for your
work, take your money and get lost
l get it.
l want my compensation,
and l want it right now
Tell me how much money you want
Don't touch me
You played with my emotions!
Now l am compensated
What are you doing?
- Manav...
What's going on here?
You hit my father!
Do you realise what you've done?
You raised your hand against the man
nobody in the world dares to insult?
But...
- You've gone mad! Go away...
lest l raise my hand too
Leave
Raise your hand.
Strike, Manav
This concerns my father's honour.
- Your father's honour matters
And my Baba has no honour?
You are all alike. Just wealthy.
Statues, stuffed with money
lf you want to leave, go. But l won't
let anyone insult my father, my family
My father means everything to me!
Everything
Understand?
- Yes...
l understand.
Now you understand this too
So much for your love
and your gift of love
What will l tell Prabha?
- Baba...
Don't cry
Baba, let's sit there
Sit
My heart, restless...
l gaze upon the pathway
With an anxious heart
l gaze upon the pathways
Life's so boring...
bereft of music
My love...
come to me...
let's make music
together
That was the only way
to make you realise
lt's a different world.
- Just as well that it's over so soon
Life happens in chapters.
One ends, another begins
Mama, this card
Vikrant Entertainment Company...?
Where did you find this?
Uncle had it
Whose card is this? Vikrant Kapoor's
entertainment company...?
We met him on our way in a stadium.
- Met him? What did he have to say?
Nothing. He recognised me
Walked up and asked me if l'm Tarababu.
Said he had heard my songs on radio
And my photo was in the papers...
- Yes, last month?
Yes. He had seen that.
He was all praise for me
lnvited me to his studio.
Monday next, at eleven
What did you say?
- l said yes, but who's going?
Brother!
You know who he is?
To me, he's a thief
plagiarizing my song
Brother, he is Vikrant Kapoor!
The top star of television
You ought to get dressed.
- Such a big man invites you
And you want to go back to Chamba?
This is wrong
For once, you ought to visit him.
Who knows what doors fate might open up
You see Vikrant has four eyes, not two.
Go on, he has called you,
he must've seen you
Go ahead. Good luck
l'm Prabha Shankar. TV reporter.
l'm Tarababu's cousin
l recognised Tarababu
the moment l set eyes on him
l compose my own music
But my company is always on the
lookout for talent in folk music...
that lies strewn all over this land.
We pick, remix and make a killing...
out of the very songs
that you sing for Jalandhar radio
Remix...?
- Remix! Get your hands on any song
Pick it or steal it.
Tinker with the orchestration
Record it, remix it,
grab copyright
Art is art whether
it's yours or someone else's
Just make sure the cash registers
ring in the moolah
Mr. Sadbud! How are you?
You're hardly to be seen nowadays
And the papers are full of you,
your name is etched in my heart
Sure you must meet me. This studio
belongs to you, why bother to ask me?
Right now l'm in a board meeting,
call me in half an hour
lf this scoundrel calls up again,
say l'm not in
Are you wondering what a fraud l am?
- Yes...
ln our business
it's the lingua franca
Among friends, we're rude
With adversaries, we're polite
They aren't familiar
with Bombay language
You do not speak?
- What... can l say?
Say that again
- What can l say?
What can l say
That's verse
Nice voice. You sing too?
- Sings better than me
And dance?
- She majored in dance and music
Right hunch!
Here is a star of Chamba
This is my friend, confidante,
secretary, manager, partner...
chief executive of this company,
Banerjee
Mr. Sutar is here from Baroda
for the charity show
Must deal with him right now
Tell him we're booked all year.
One show will cost 5 million
No charity. You pay up, we deliver
All these charities are frauds,
raking it in. And from artistes...
they expect concessions.
l told him off, Tarababu
l'm a man of the 21st century.
Be it wedding, party or awards...
pay up and l'll make music
Tarababu... we artists
are priceless
l'm glad to know
your regard for artistes
Emotions hold you
and will forever hold you in poverty
While you were, singing in the hills
l made millions out of your remixes
Look, only your compositions
What l'm offering Tarababu, is this.
Join us, compose songs for us
Ms.. Manasi can sing,
she can model in our shows
Begin life anew. Simple
Give us a couple of days to think.
- Sure, think it over
Accept or reject,
choice is yours
This attitude won't help.
You belong in the 21st century
Sitting at home,
cribbing and complaining won't do
You've heard what language
today's men use. Use your brains
What gain returning to Chamba?
Will you make a mockery of yourself?
Tara's school is debt-ridden
As for you, what about your life?
l've no idea of your past sorrows.
But success is going to be painful
You seem to have had
your share of suffering?
l have suffered. Quite alike
the Hindi film hero...
who suffers all his childhood
after his father deserts his mother
My mother turned a seamstress to give
me an education. Gave me music too
And then...
she died.
l'm left an orphan.
The same... same sad story
Mother
But she left me with some
principles from the 20th century
Here, 20th century principles.
Sacrifice is supreme
Do your good deeds, your duty
without expectation of any reward
For 5 years after graduating,
l clung on to these ideals
And what outcome? l starved
On stage, l played this rattle.
And Banerjee was a photographer
Then life took a new turn.
We met Uncle Jaidev
He gave us these 7 commandments
for the 21st century
He said son, forget the old ideals.
Become the modern 21st century man
First commandment,
love is a matter of give and take
Give and take
First do good to yourself,
others come later
Me first
Anything done without regard
to outcome is useless
What is gain? How much profit?
What's the result?
Enterprise is more necessary
than integrity. Business
Envy is essential for winning
in competition. Jealousy
Avarice is the prerequisite
for riches. Greed
One-upmanship is essential for growth.
Cut them to size
has turned me into a Vikrant Kapoor
You mean you became practical.
- Here in Mumbai...
showmanship is everything
Laurels make for publicity,
window-dressing is marketing
You will see where we take Manasi.
- But only if she passes the test
Kapoor, tell her about the contract.
- First, auditions. A song and a video
What's the second condition?
- Condition Two...
during the 3-year contract period,
you may not marry
What...?
- No marriage, no friendships
No love, no romance.
You see Ms. Manasi...
Emotions are what we sell,
not what we buy
Manav, at least hear Deep Mohan out.
- Whatever he might have to say...
the household staff told me everything.
Aunt Shaku is at fault
And the issue is, our civility.
- You'll teach us civilised behaviour?
Certainly. What noblesse oblige behooves
you must learn
The Tarababu whom you feted like a king
in Chamba was made to sit with the dogs
The one you lauded as the priest of
the arts was called slave to wealth
For 9 hours...
father and daughter sat in the sun.
After such humiliation...
can anyone contain his indignation?
- Manav, what is your point?
Day after, Daddy returns from London.
You will make a clean breast of this
Am l to tell my brother that he must
put up with someone who slapped him?
lf breaking glass or raising voice
makes truth...
then l have broken 7 glasses.
Makes me 7 times more righteous?
Let me explain the real issue.
A 21 year old blindly in love...
behaves like this, because he is bent
upon mending his fate
And that of his family.
- Our destinies...
we won't let you play with.
- lt is a changed fate already
Your Manav now belongs to another.
Take a look if you'd like
Manav's Manasi. She will enter
this family as a bride
And together we will pose for
a family portrait
That's a promise
To you
you
and you
Grannie, may l leave?
Oh love...
l understand it now...
l know the feeling
When you never knew,
you were confused
Now you know, your plight
is no more
Yes, now l know
And l know too
lt's love, it's passion, desire
She has it. She's good.
- Yes, get her to sign the contract
Hey...
Man, l'm talking to you. You're
getting in my heroine's way
Move, l'm talking to you
Some new hero
Mister, we're working.
Please step aside
Look, l must meet Manasi.
- Manasi? Do you know her?
Yes, closely.
- How is she related to you?
Lover.
- What...?
One minute
You see that boy? Wants to see you.
Says, you're his lover
No sir. l'm nobody's lover
and l don't want to see him
Shall l tell him off?
- Yes sir
Brother, she doesn't want to see you,
doesn't even know you
Nor is she your beloved,
understand?
l got to see her
After shooting. l'm being a gentleman.
Maybe you should reciprocate? Please...
Let us work. Please
Manasi, stop
l can understand your anguish
My mistake
Now that l know the truth
l respect you even more
Do you know why?
Because...
a girl who will sacrifice her love
for the sake of her father's honour...
will make an ideal wife,
someone a man will treasure
l'm here to apologise
Your father should be the one
to apologise. To my father
Why? My father was slapped
No, that's wrong.
Absolutely wrong
l respect my father
just as you respect your Baba
lt's done! Vikrant wants the contract
signed today. lt's an auspicious day
l've read the contract.
Just sign it
For 3 years,
you are Vikrant's heroine
Sign here
These are what you threw away
l'll string the pearls again
You will wear it again
lf God be within me,
if l am honest...
one day, you will come running
into my arms
You...
will
Brother...
So, met her?
- Yes
Decision taken?
- Yes
What?
- Signed for you, rescinded me
Turned you down?
- Yes, she turned me down
Friend, l don't know your story
but l know this
ln the world of stardom...
stars are hung on skies.
Stars in the sky...
never come down to earth.
You are beyond reality, my friend
You probably don't know her. l do.
She will come, she'll come to me
And you will be the one
who sends her to me
Me..?
- You
l'm a businessman. Pure businessman.
- As a businessman you will...
you'll send her to me, for sure.
- One thing, l like your confidence
Whatever you told Deep... is it true?
- Absolutely
They humiliated Tarababu and Manasi.
That was wrong
That is why you were humiliated.
That too was wrong
But... it is also true..
Yes, carry on
l love Manasi.
l've promised l'll marry her
So, now what? Will you leave home?
Will you bring me to disgrace?
No... that will never happen.
Something that sullies...
your family or your name...
l will never do
No scenes, no pettiness,
no violence
Neither will l leave you
nor will l elope with Manasi
That is my promise to you
lf l refuse to give my consent
to your marriage to Manasi...?
You won't do that
ln the design of your schemes
l fell for Manasi. The love grew
Only difference, your regard
for Tarababu was business
My love for Manasi is humane,
as between man and woman
This won't happen.
Manasi will not enter this house
Very well, if my love is a sham,
she will never come
But if God be within me,
if l am honest...
if my love is true, you yourself
will bring Manasi to this house
You
Not anymore...
No more, my love...
l can take it no more
The nightingale sings
in the forests...
Not even if there be fire...
not even for fear of venom...
not even if the skies fall...
come what may...
anguish in my broken heart
is unbearable
Come now, my beloved
Even death can't kill love
Without love, there's no life
ln every passing moment...
the heartache still remains
Even if all is forgotten...
some memories still remain
Like a plant withering
with weeds...
still in hope for an Eden...
engulfed in thorns...
now no medicine,
no prayer can save you...
from this affliction...
Love
Love is unfaithful
But lonely is a loveless life
Beware, never give your heart,
yet your heart you will lose
And you will awake in pleasure
your sleepless nights
Your pain, your pleasure
belongs to someone else
No use promises, no matter
how much you will try
Oh but for love,
this would...
become a world of ascetics
Come to me...love
Come fire...venom
falling skies
apocalypse
can't erase...
the anguish...
in my broken heart
Extra-ordinary success story
an extra-ordinary girl
Manasi Shankar, whom you will meet
at the MTV party tonight
Our search of a star,
ends right here
Because we have Manasi, the winner
of the MTV viewers choice
with Manasi, l knew...
she'd become the world's
biggest star
l used to watch MTV but l never dreamt
l'd top the MTV charts
What were your dreams about?
- That was another dream
Being honoured by MTV
is really exciting, l'm thrilled
Blood in my veins is pumping
twice as fast. Twice
Manav is here
l'm very excited! Blood in my veins
is pumping six times as fast. Six
Brother...
You... here?
- Yes, right here
How come...?
- Just like you came
Are you a winner too?
- Not yet but maybe later...?
Can l have two minutes?
- Sure
Frankly, l admire you.
- l admire you too
But Your Highness, Your Majesty...
what brings the jilted lover here?
Grand party! MTV is honouring us.
You feel like ruining it?
Notjilted, sir.
l am her lover
Whose?
- Hers
Look, this is a business party.
lt's the first day of her success
That's why l'm here
Like a gentleman, l will suggest
that you might slip away
l told you. Manasi belongs to me.
l belong to Manasi, so l'm here
But she refuses to
acknowledge you
Sir! She's in a temper!
ln love, there are fights
So you're convinced
that she will return to you?
And you will send her to me
He is crazy, show him out
Ladies and gentlemen...
Tonight is for Manasi Shankar
Tonight's Chief Guest is the young,
dashing, handsome... Mr. Manav Mehta
Sole heir to the Mehta and Mehta
fortunes, he has won...
the maximum college awards
while in London...
not only in lndian music but
in lndian literature
He is MTV's Chief Guest.
- Where are the drinks?
You don't want to be this.
You are Manav-si
Tell me you don't love me
No
Give up this sham of a life.
Shall l leave?
l'll wait for you
My blood is pumping
twelve times faster
Meter reading
Your red-cravat was saying...
- l don't want to hear
Whatever you say,
there's something about him
Prabha told me all about Manav.
You should make friends with him
What's the harm? ln a romance
the parents always play villain
He's in love with you
Enough
At this point l must remind you that
according to your contract...
no artiste working for your company
has the right...
to make friends, fall in love
or get married
For my work and my career, this
banal conversation is an aberration
l don't like working like this!
l don't want to work here
She's a wounded tigress.
Why needle her?
You only find arrogant girls,
not girls who have self respect
Please give the phone to Manasi
Manasi... call for you.
From Vikrant's studio
Tell him l don't want to work
l don't get you
We're launching a new bra.
Like this
And you want a beautiful model
to advertise this bra
From us?
- Yes
And you only want Manasi?
- Yes
And she will be on hoardings
all over the city?
Right
We can pay you the asking price.
And you know that Manasi is a singer?
- Yes
And she's a dancer.
- Yes
She's an artiste. A star.
- Stars will strip for the money.
True. And the money is nice
Banerjee... you're such a fool!
You get such foolish clients
They don't realise Manasi
comes from a good family
She won't do this kind
of modeling
Either you're a fool
or they are
Excuse Mr. Kapoor...
Nowadays girls from good backgrounds
are also into modeling
Then my advice to you is, you have
a far better model than Manasi...
sitting right next to you
What?
- Mr. Kapoor...
She's pretty, healthy.
She looks great
They're the Mehta family...
- l know
lf you belong to a respectable family
you learn how to respect others
You deal with these scoundrels.
l'm busy
We sell art
not the modesty of girls
l don't think you're
any judge of men
Your rights and wrongs
are all mixed up
Tarababu has sent his composition.
- Why didn't he come?
He's not well.
- And Manasi..?
She refused to come.
l've called her 6 times in 4 days
But she doesn't want to come?
You're such a fool! You're my enemy
You love to humiliate me!
- What have l done?
Why did you call her 6 times?
Don't you know what
Vikrant Kapoor is?
Girls like her
have come and gone
A few smiles and accolades
and she thinks she's Miss World?
One award and she thinks
she is a star
Tell Tarababu
l don't want his song
So it hurts?
Who can hurt me? Who?
l'm tough! Tough!
You don't appear to be as tough...?
- Where do you find me weak?
ln there. Your heart
- What do you mean... heart?
From the heart. For the first time
you spoke from your heart
Really, you miss Manasi, don't you?
- Don't bore me. Go away
What harm being honest?
- Go away
You are missing her
What happened?
- What should never happen
Love?
- No, hatred
Hatred?
- No song today?
Sorry folks.
Today's session... cancelled
l am... Manasi
What you did wasn't right.
- l know
l want to be back.
- l'll wait for you
l don't know what happened
inside my heart
To love, l drank
l have lived...
l drank to love
O' wanderer...
To love, l drank...
in a moment, ages l have lived
Drunken in ecstasy...
in moments, a life in centuries
lived, drunk
O wanderer...
when you drank
the potion of love...
what happened
inside your heart?
Ecstasy and lifetimes in centuries
l have lived in a moment's time
l have drunk...
l have lived... here
Why this obsession?
Why infect yourself?
l saw her in ecstasy,
whipping up a frenzy
My heart went out to her...
and l was drunken in love
Then l fell in love
and l renounced the world...
like a hermit
But he never got to know,
it never touched his heart
l never could cry out my pain,
did it never touch your heart?
ln ecstasy l'm drunken
ln a moment, many centuries
l have lived
l have drunk
l have lived
l have wandered
Manav just walked out and went
to live in Dad's cottage
Let him be.
- Wonderful
We'll name the cottage
Romeo's lair
What do you want to say?
- Vikrant likes Manasi
He had this delivered
through Banerjee
What does this mean?
- He's asking for her hand
- But...
- No buts!
You don't find
eligible bachelors like Vikrant
Prabha...
- At heart Vikrant is simple
Like us. Manasi will be
very happy with him
He will give her all his love,
l guarantee
But why in a hurry...?
- Up to you
lf you want Manasi to remain
a spinster, so be it
You want to turn away good fortune,
then so be it
Think of Manasi. Once she's married,
she'll forget all her sorrows
What are you saying Baba?
- l let you decide your fate, didn't l?
This is your turn to obey me.
This is your success, not mine
Success for a father lies in finding
a suitable boy for his daughter
Look my dear... who knows
when life will cheat me?
Before l die l want to see
you married to a good boy
Don't... don't turn me down.
For my sake
Yes, l sent the proposal
through Banerjee
Will you really
be able to love me?
Do you know some people fall
in love and get married?
And some get married
and fall in love
Second category. Second category?
Has she gone away from me?
Which path has she taken?
Every path...
...leads to my heart
You aren't with me...
maybe you aren't with me,
but that's a different story
Within me...
you are within me
You are away,
but we aren't separated
You're angry with me...
but you aren't unfaithful
Your hand
l hold in mine
You are with me
Fortunate are those that die
at the hands of their beloved
You seem very happy?
- Yes
Sanjay Prabhu from lndia's top
company BPL just called me
He says they want to
send us to Canada
For MTV lnternational Awards.
- MTV?
Yes. You've brought me
so much of luck
What? Fire?
You can't go in there!
- lt's my cottage on fire
l said, you can't
No, son. You can't go ahead.
- But my belongings...
What a Romeo! That's a no-go
That's my cottage! There are
very precious things inside
Forget this! Come with me.
- We have orders
Damn your cottage! l got to save
goods worth millions in the go down
Carry on
l'm absolutely fine
Just burnt my hand a little.
The rest is safe
Had no idea that the fire
would be flaming inside
Everybody else was trying
to save the go down
l too had a few precious things
My violin, the digital camera
you gave me, my computer
Doctor says l can be home tomorrow
for tennis
l want a game of tennis with you.
Haven't played tennis with you in ages
One who isn't accustomed
to lying...
should never lie
l am your daddy
What is it?
- You can't enter without signing
l'm going in! You can't stop me.
- Listen...
He came in without authorisation.
He didn't even sign the register
Says he's your friend
You may go
He is our guest
Welcome, Jagmohan. Sit
Chhaya, get a cold drink
for our guest
Yes
Today is the day we worship
the Goddess of Knowledge
The Goddess of Knowledge, you know...?
Don't embarrass me, Tarababu
l'm here to apologise for my mistake
l come asking for my son's life
Manasi...
l come to ask for Manasi's hand...
- Don't say it
No Jagmohan! l stood at your door
asking for my daughter's life...
No... no
Little would you know how deeply
your deceit shocked my daughter
How many nights she cried
... how many nights?
Now...
now she belongs
to somebody else
Don't say that.
- That's the way it is, Jagmohan
She is away in Canada
with Vikrant Kapoor
They will get married
when they return next week
You understand?
Sky Dome! What a huge stadium!
Thousands of people
Singers from all countries
have come, Manasi
Big competition! What will happen?
Anyway, it'll be fun
Vikrant is confident that
you will win the first prize
Have you read about Manav Mehta?
- Are you sorry?
Get back to work
The son of London's wealthiest man
jumped into a raging fire...
to save a scarf
given by his beloved
Nobody knows
who the beloved is
Why are you going on and on?
- lt's in the papers!
l don't want to see!
You know l'm engaged
Engagement done and all is over?
Manav risked his life
You don't even shed a tear for him?
- This world has turned you to stone
Can't you make one phone call?
- lla please...
He loved you, truly.
- lla, Shanno, Vikrant is calling you
My love, may l make an appearance?
- One minute, please
You aren't ready?
The entire orchestra is waiting
ln tears, weren't you?
You were crying
Missing him...?
l know you love me
And l love you, right?
Let cheer the Coke.
Brighten up with a Coke
Love only grows
Drink.
Coke is sponsoring us. Drink
Drink Manasi
Look...
We got to win this
world competition
To win, one got to put heart and soul
into the song
Just concentrate on the song
Listen...
Can l sing a folk song from
my village for today's show?
Folk? But the orchestra is ready.
Another song... now?
You just said, to win, l got to put
heart and soul into the song
Manasi will make new music!
From her heart, from her soul
Promises l made
to someone l loved...
l have broken
But my heart, my life...
maybe l...
left behind
lf not for love...
what's left to live for?
lf not for love,
what's left to die for?
Love's sweet
And bittersweet
A promise to be kept,
yet so weak a chord...
Love
Before me...
upon this path...
many lovers have trod
Did the path lead to sea...
in which all was drowned?
The harshest of truths...
the worst of illusions...
promise most resolute...
yet the weakest ties...
without love
lf not for love
what's left to live for?
lf not for love,
what's left to die for?
Loads of congratulatory calls
coming in from lndia
Are you happy?
- Much
Last night, the tears while you sang,
made for a terrific touch
You had to let out
this venom that was Manav
l'm glad it happened
before we got married
Had it happened afterwards,
l would have been very hurt
Tomorrow we get married,
then the reception and then...
The BPL guys called. At the airport,
we'll get a grand reception
Tomorrow is going to be the best day
in my life! Best
You're about to become
Mrs. Vikrant Kapoor
Are you happy?
- Yes
ls everything all right?
Did Manav come here?
He came.
- What was he saying?
Wanted to meet Manasi.
Then...?
- He just vanished
Mr. Commissioner... l need security.
Strict security
Everything is arranged
Manasi isn't feeling well.
Can you please...?
Stage set. By 4 o'clock you'll be
married. Then, the reception at Leela
And Manav?
- lf he transpires...
we'll get him out of the way.
- Kill him, if need be
We'll have a great time together
Baba, Manasi is calling you.
Hold this
What is it?
What's going on?
- What...?
Whom are you socialising with?
l see. ln life, first we make friends.
Then we like them, then we have fights
An apology after a fight,
draws friends even closer
Baba, do you realise
what you're saying?
Jagmohan has come to bless you.
As my friend
Let's go in
Let it be, Tarababu.
l'll make a move
Forgive me, she...
- Apology...? No, never mind
Excuse me
Don't be afraid Manasi. l haven't
come to set your life on fire
l'm here to douse the fire
No, Manav. Not today.
- lt has to be today
l must wipe the make-up
from your sister's face
Manasi, l only come to tell you
a marriage is neither a contract
Nor a festivity! The festivities
are for the others
Marriage is a union of two souls,
two hearts, two people who will live...
to consummate their loves.
Until death, to part
By marrying Vikrant, you're deceiving
him the worst, and yourself
Three lives will be ruined!
You are marrying Vikrant
But Manav lives in your heart!
Only Manav
No! Nobody in my heart.
- You lie
ln every song of yours,
Manav lives
Manav is your first and last love
Mister, out.
- One minute
Look at you.
Crying
Those tears tell you what's happening
isn't true. Lovers die, love never dies
Outside, please.
- Forget it, Manav
l'm yours,
l will wait for you
Get a hold on yourself
How long will it take?
- At least an hour and a half
l'm feeling faint.
May l sit in the car?
l don't get this. A wedding in court
and religious rites too?
You won't get this
The music is lifeless. The end
What kind of security is this?
Do you see that man with the dog?
He is my enemy. He has a bomb
in his pocket
Human bomb... he will
blow up all of us
Wait a minute
Boy, don't make move.
- Am l moving?
l thought you would
Why did you think of marrying
in court before the ceremony?
Will it do if l tell
you tomorrow?
Ask me at the reception.
Right now l'm a bit tense
What happened?
- Nothing. He's one of Manasi's fans
Like normal fans. We found this
photo of Manasi in his pocket
Look
Unlike what you said, no bomb
He's different from other fans.
Arrest him
There has to be a reason.
l can't simply arrest him
You can't arrest him?
- l can't
You can't?
- l can't
Then join the dance.
Come on, dance
Brownie
This crowd has driven me crazy
How are you?
- Fine
He's here. The leech!
What does he want from us?
Brownie...
You know him?
- Manav's dog
You even care for Manav's dog?
So he sent his dog in his stead
Get lost
Go back to that rascal
My dog will die!
- Hold him
Let go
Bash him up
Sister! Let's go, please
Manav, your Brownie
lla, Shannu...
tell me something truthfully
Yes?
What did Manav tell Manasi
in the airport lounge?
Swear that by Manasi
He said,
Manasi might be marrying you,...
but only Manav lives in her heart
Look...
They're here too?
Next
How much longer?
- 3 are registered. Two couples left
Everything's in place,
police, security, the works
The international press
will be at the reception
Superstar Kappu
marries beauty queen Manasi
On Monday, take Lord Shiva's blessings.
You will always be successful in life
Sorry, l don't have a coin.
- Take this
May you marry the man after your heart,
may you always be happy
Almost done. The registrar
will call you in 5 minutes
l'll be there.
- Prabha, bring them in
ln 5 minutes, we'll be married.
Life's strange
Will you be honest?
Are you happy?
Yes, l'm happy.
Do you love me?
- What...?
Do you love me?
- What kind of a question is this?
That act of giving alms
reminded me of my mother
Mother would say, do good
and forget about it
Do your duty, never expect rewards.
True love lies in sacrifice
Uncle Jaidev said it's trash.
Grab, grab, grab
l don't know why l get this
losing feeling
That Manav of yours,
he's trying to defeat me
And l'm not used to defeat!
Not at all
l want to win.
Come what may
lf you feel the slightest gratitude
towards me, you will help me win
l...? How?
Look... at my love.
l possess only arrogance,
envy, jealousy, grit
And Manav? God lives in him.
God, really
His love, his true love
will hit me hard, always
He was right. Marriage is no contract
nor festivity. lt's a union of souls
Of two people who will live
to consummate their loves
He was right. Winning world contests,
and fashionable clothes...
cannot change
the quintessential lndian girl
For her, the first love
is always the first love
Look, l'm a director.
l know it
l hear the voice inside.
Manav pervades you...
your every pore,
your every drop of blood. Look
Silly girl! You fought with
your love and you came to me
You changed yourself,
couldn't change your heart
Your heart is there... with Manav.
Manav is the music in your songs
Not l
Today... you have to give me victory.
Guess how? Open this door
And run to Manav in
front of everyone
Please. For my sake
For the happiness
of all three of us
Go. Go, Manasi!
We, l mean you, me and Manav
will always remain friends
Come on. Don't think
Come on. He's called you.
- No Banerjee
Manasi is going to Manav.
Go Manasi, go
Go
Manav is waiting for you
Manasi has gone to Manav
Yes
So now...
- Let's embrace
We separated you.
- And we're bringing you together
You have our blessings
Embrace her
How can they?
We're looking on
Let's get out of here
ls this possible?
- lt's happening
