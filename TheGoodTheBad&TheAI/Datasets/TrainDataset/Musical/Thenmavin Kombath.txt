Halli means village.
It's one of the villages in between
of Karnataka and Kerala.
Only poor people live there.
Many languages..Many cuIture...
They follow their own rules
and principles.
That follows here.
It's time for moon to rise...
You sing...
In this country people gets excites
seeing the rain clouds.
Paddy sways towards the left.
In this country parrot's
songs flow like honey.
Even waste lands become fertile when
the river flows through them.
l'm also coming with gold
ornaments etc.
With the beats produced by the
crane on the pond.
Oh my bulls, please
run fast.
Anxiously waiting to reach the
country which is far off.
ls the country which l like most.
You also come to this
cold place.
Hey Manickam -Yes brother.
Why're you late?
No pick up like before. -What?
l meant that l didn't have
the old pick up.
Whatever it's lets wash our faces
in the temple tank and go home.
There's water in the cart
gargle your mouth.
Take 2 caramoms from the box and
chew them.That's all.
Yes...Yes...It's not like earlier.
She'll know that l've had liquor
the moment she smells cardamom.
That's right. Will anybody chew cardamom
early in the morning?
There's another trick brother.
-Don't tell me.
Whenever l listened to your words
l got into trouble.
You just listen to what l say.
Stop...
While talking about the fare
to Yashodhama.
Don't tell her that
l drank liquor.
l'll not tell even if l'm beheaded.
Do you want to gargle your mouth?
l don't want...l'm not drunk, right?
- l'll give you blow.
Manickam, are you doing fine?
Nothing special.
Greetings sir.
How was the fair this time?
ls this the fair Munuswamy?
Fair'll look like a fair only after
the month of Kumbham.
You idiot...
How many times l've told you not to stand,
With the broom and water l come out
early in the morning.
Why did you come out when l was standing
with the broom and water?
l've not seen a fool
like you anywhere, ruined.
When did you come back
from the fair?
l came at dawn -Where are those 2?
Brother and Manickam are coming behind?
He said, he'll deliver the things in the fair
bathe the bull & take the cart.
He might be fully drunk!
- l've no idea.
l didn't see him going to the toddy shop.
-Then what did you see?
l saw him coming out of the
toddy shop.
Oh he must be without 'dhothi'.
He had the dhothi.
But he had wrapped it around his head
so that it'll not be removed.
Oh my god!
You came here without bringing him
after seeing him in that condition.
l called him but he rebuked
me a lot.
l reached Rajamadai
at the break of dawn.
That time l heard bus people saying
that he fought at the fair.
Lord is a poor man.
He got spoiled after he became
friendly with Manickam.
Don't tell him that l told you all this.
Why did you bad mouth Manickam?
Just because he's bad.
He's also a servant here.
But he thinks he is the lord here.
Only after he's chucked out form here
this family'll be saved.
Watch...l'll tell Manickam about it.
l don't care...Why should l be
scared of him?
lf he plays the fool with me
l'll urge the bull to kick him & kill him.
Who is more important to you, me or him?
Don't forget l'm your Fiancee.
After the harvest l should
only marry you.
ls it enough if only you decide
about my marriage?
That was your father's promise.
Then marry my father.
Don't l've to go to heaven for that?
Lord is coming.
Injimuda Gandhari would've got the
information, isn't it Manickam?
Then...This time we bought
spritely cows.
Why to bother about the price?
We can see at the fair how fast it runs.
This time l'll make the honour of the
Gandhari fly like the kite.
Only then Yashodama
will understand us.
l've already understood you people.
Hey tell the truth did you drink toddy
-Me? Toddy?
Oh god! -Tell me the truth?
Drank toddy?
l didn't. -Not you...l asked
you. Did he drink?
No... -No?
Now tell me didn't be drink?
-He drank.
Now a days you've started
telling lies to me.
Since l got it free
l drank a glass of toddy.
That was to feel good. lf it was wrong
forgive me. -Enough?
Didn't you pick up a fight?
-Fight? Me?
Oh god! Who told you all this?
Manickam, did you hear?
That's a lie...Nothing happened like that.
Keep your hand on the head.
Not on your head but
on my head.
Tell me what happened in the fair
after he drank toddy?
That was nothing in particular.
His leg slipped and he fell.
That's all.
What happened next?
Where he fell, there
was a strength less pillar too.
Even that fell along with him.
That's what happened? -Yes.
There was a pot under the pillar.
That broke...That's all that happened.
And we came back.
Keep your hand here.
Was there a fight due to
the breaking of the pot?
Not 1 pot...There were 10-20 pots
on top of that pot.
As soon as the pot at the bottom broke
others also broke into pieces.
It's natural.
One of the broken pieces
hit the glass of the lorry.
Broken pieces hit the glass only that
much had happened -It's natural.
Lorry man wasn't reconciled when this
drunk tried to explain to him?
So we called the policeman and
explained the sequence to him.
And we left the place.
That's all that happened there.
Hey tell me clearly.
Okay, l'll tell it clearly.
Lorry man had hit our lord.
He hit him back.
There was a severe fight.
Then policeman arrived and
filed the case.
Oh god!...Were you beaten
up badly?
l got 3 blows and l gave
back 10-20 blows.
Since he was injured badly
so l didn't...
Then we didn't stay
there any longer.
When policeman arrived and filed the case
We told him not to file the case we'll not...
We told him that Yashodama's
waiting for us.
''We came here to get a saree
for her for pongal''.
So we came back here after getting
a grand saree.
Look here...l told the weaver
to give me the best, and brought it.
Even Gandhari doesn't have
a saree like this.
lf you wear this and come to
the temple on Pongal,
Even if 100 bulls were
assembled there,
Everybody'll be only looking
at your pretty face.
Wear this and come soon
lets look at your saree.
Not now...When you come back victorious
in the bull's race.
l'll wear this and wait
to meet you. -Yes she's right.
This all... -You don't utter a word.
Both of you'll get it from me.
Have bath and eat something.
You said that you'll not say anything
even if you're beheaded.
You've to listen attentively
when l say something.
l said l'll not say anything
even if l am beheaded.
Won't l die if l'm beheaded!
Then how could l say?
Don't show off! You would've
know if l hasn't there.
Brother, where are you going?
To get drowned.
Don't talk unnecessary things.
Don't apple polish me.
Tell me directly, whatever you want to say.
Yesterday, parrot said that
our wishes'll come true.
Which parrot?
That Astrology parrot picked up the
card which said that it'll be fulfilled.
What'll be fulfilled?
- My wish of marrying you.
Yes, nowadays events are governed
by astrology?
Oh Parrot...l'll kick &
kill everything.
Definitely parrot's words
will come true.
Don't tell Appakalai what the
parrot said.
Even then, he's very angry with you.
He said madam that you, people drank
toddy & picked up a fight at the fair.
This punishment is for informing her
that we drank toddy.
Punishment for informing her about the
fight l picked up with the lorry man.
Manickam how many bulls do we've?
We....52...53...55 bulls.
For 55 bulls...fetch water from the well
& fill 4 troughs for each bull.
Bathe them before evening.
Then meet me.
What about the punishment for
informing her about the arrival of the police.
l'll tell you the punishment
for that at that time.
Come....
Hey Manickam, l'll fix you.
l've found a man to participate
in the cart race, Marimuthu.
He's number cart driver
in the entire market.
But, he'll demand more money.
- Money isn't the problem at all.
But, l must win the race.
Madam..Don't give importance
to his words
Oh Last Pongal, he boasted
& brought a bull.
After the race, Manickam won.
Whatever it is, our bull didn't
lose to Manickam's bull.
We lost our honour as well as
the bet, 100 acres of land.
l'll not allow him inside
if our bull fails this time.
Rajaiah, give him whatever
he requests.
Oh God, he's coming.
Why did you come here?
You always come here by having a
bag under your arms.
There're many things here for you to
take and go, aren't they?
Junior Lord'll be having betel
leaves in the box.
Get me a betel leaf.
It's long since l chewed
Thulasi Betel leaves.
My tongue is salivating.
Hey, even my tongue is itching.
l'll give you a betel chew it
and quit the place.
l'll go only after celebrating Pongal
with junior lord and Yashodama.
That's good.
You've decided to stay here for
Then, you'll find tobacco
in Jr.Lord's box.
Lime'll be as sweet as honey.
Bring even that while
you bring the betel.
l had heard that some
graze cows in other's fields.
Now, l've seen it myself.
This isn't your father's
field, right?
Hey, if you talk about my father.
What'll you do if l talk
about your father?
Just say it once again.
Your father is a beggar,
shameless creep.
Agreed?- Yes.
ls it?- Yes.
It's enough, if l know that.
What was the bitter arguments
between father and son?
Things are okay.
But he's going bit too far.
What happened?
Mother, l've a only sister, right?
He comes here very rarely.
Then, What's the purpose of his
coming here alone without her?
It's very long time since
l've seen her.
That's right, you could've
brought Chinnu with you.
l've also seen her a very
long time ago.
Next week she is having exams, that's why.
Yes, after finishing her exams, she'll...
lf l stay here any further...
He said so, out of worries.
You don't take his words serious.
Oh God....When l see him bossing here
l really feel very happy.
Working here, in Madambi palace.
ls there any other job more
valuable than this, in the world.
l've experienced it
personally, haven't l?
Those times have gone.
Srikrishnan came here after
selling the palace & the house.
l opposed but he was very
insistant about it.
Can't blame him.
She did injustice to you.
Though he's your brother, you brought
him up in the place of mother.
Then could he bear it?
A Gandhari...She's not
Gandhari but Kali .
Tell her that Kannaiya.
She still has some soft
corner for them.
They're her husband's
people, aren't they?
You don't talk nonsense.
l don't have soft corner for anybody.
Only your words are
important to me.
After us,
Don't we need an heir to take care
of all this?
That's why, l asked you to marry.
Many proposals had come.
You refused to marry.
l had asked whether you've
somebody in your mind.
You said 'No'.
Kannaiya, do you know how many vows
l had taken for his marriage.
Now l've grown old sister.
It'll be wrong if l talk to you.
Kannaiya, come to the backyard if you
want anything.
Regarding your marriage,
l'll marry...you've someone?
lf you want to marry,
then decide soon.
After you lose your pick up then...
What? - l said if you lose your pick up,
nothing will work out.
l'll give you a blow.
Did you see? Mani got me
this to wear on Pongal.
Do you know how since when he
is going to the fair?
All these years, l go to the temple,
wearing the dress he gets me for pongal.
l've kept them safely.
l kept him here when he was 4.
Even l feel jealous of the love
you've for him.
l'm worried only about Sri Krishna.
He lives for me, not for his own self.
He's involved in all of his tricks.
He can't advise him
even for good things.
Hey girl....after Kannaiya finishes eating
wash these vessels too.
Chinnamma, do you've
anything to say?
l'm telling you truth.
This is my child.
Other than him, l haven't had
any sex with my other man.
Even he's right when he asks.
You and your husband have dark
complexions.
How did you deliver a
fair baby?
What do you think?
Your decision is our decision.
- l'll decide.
We the panchayat believe that
she's lying.
She's making her husband responsible
for the child fathered by someone.
We've to shave her head,make her sit
on a donkey & hit her.
And take her around
the village.
This is the decision of the panchayat.
l've not committed any aduItery.
Has any one got to say
anything about this.
May any one got any objections?
Yes, l do have.
Without knowing the truth,
you mustn't punish this girl.
What do you mean?
l mean that you can't punish tell her
crime is proved. - Yes.
Panchayat has gathered here.
To know how did they beget a fair
child when both of them are dark.
Madam Gandhari has currently judged
that Chemana is at fauIt.
Can you prove it's wrong?
lf l do....
lf you do...then from tomorrow onwards
you be the chieftain.
Or else you'll be taken on the donkey
with a shaved head.
Agreed? - Yes.
Hey Kitappa, come here.
Have it...- No need.
Have it.
For last 20 years, he didn't know that
she had an affair with somebody, right?
Nobody in this tiny village have a
different opinion about Chinnama.
Do you?
Okay, only on the premises
that black & black can not be white,
You've accused her.
But, l'll not let you accuse her
under those premises.
What was the colour of the betel leaf
l gave him?
Green right?...and the
lime's colour was white.
lf he doesn't spit out any
one of those colours,
l'll bash him up to pulp.
Spit man...spit.
Babies will be of fair
or dark complexion.
Suspecting your wife by listening
to other's...
Take the baby and go home.
You've saved my honour sir.
You didn't tell me whether l've to sit
in your place or on the donkey.
l've relinquished my chieftain's post.
Hereafter, Srikrishnan
will be chieftain.
Stop...Stop please.
Enough. -Stop.
lf Injimuda people win this race
what'll Madambi people give?
bullock carts, 101 cows.
What'll Injimuda people give
if they lose?
....202 cows....
Okay then lets begin.
- yes lets begin.
Start.
Hey come.
Bunch of special bananas: 50.
Bunch of young coconuts: 60.
Bunch of coconuts: 400.
Then what about the mango peel?
- No...coconuts: 450.
Delivered all these items
in Velu's place.
Okay you take the cart and go.
lf you go there & talk any
nonsense to Yashodama.
l'll chop you. -Go...
Oh, sister-in-law is coming.
Hey shut up, man.
l've warned you several times
not to talk about her.
Enough of counting....
Give the money.
Boss....This time you didn't deliver
any items to my shop.
Groundnuts, dry coconut & something else
That's your business, right?
But no use bargaining the price...
Don't expect anything.
You always think about money.
Have you heard this song
Manicka?- Which song?
Everybody says that you're a
stone hearted person.
Kathu sister, he's not a
stone hearted man.
He got into this mess.
l don't think he'll marry
anybody in this birth.
Then l'll also not marry.
He has loved me for 10 yrs.
l know, that he'll marry only me
if he wants to marry.
That's why, l still wait for him,
not whole heartedly.
But now he has only
one aim in his life.
To subjugate that Injimuda Gandhari.
You yourself say.
The injustice which Gandhari did
to Yasodhama & him, was it fair?
She got her brother married to Yashodama
without revealing that he's mad.
She delivered a baby.
And that mad fellow jumped into the
well and died with that baby.
We didn't get even the corpses.
Would the corpses be found if he didn't
marry me?- l didn't mean that.
After that incident Gandhari threw
Yashodama out of the house.
Didn't give her the properties too.
That till he subjugates Gandhari,
he'll not lead a family life,
He has taken an Oath.
What else can l call it except
''my bad luck''.
Okay, aren't you marrying anybody?
Don't l've to get a girl
according to my taste?
Leave that oldy...l'm ready.
l'll give you a blow. His mischief...
l'll fix you later, just watch.
We're deceived.
Private buses have gone
on strike suddenly.
Oh God! What'll we do with
this girl and him?
Can you accommodate them in your
house for the time being?
My father is angry with me
for staging a drama.
lf l make the artistes also
stay there, heavens will fall.
Why isn't the bus not
to be seen?
Bus people have gone on
strike suddenly.
How could he say like this?
We've promised to reach Meenakshipuram
tomorrow to stage a drama.
What can we do if
bus people strike?
What'll we do if you talk like that?
We came for your drama.
It's your responsibility to send us
back. Call a taxi man.
Oh God!...That'll cost a fortune.
We can't afford it.
Don't play the fool with me.
You'll be in a soup.
Brother, don't shout
we're known here.
Then call a taxi man.
l'll think about some way.
- Then do it.
By the time you bring the party
l'll have toddy and come.
Having toddy isn't the problem.
But you'll not find me
if you create trouble.
l've stopped getting beatings, now.
No...l'll not create any problems.
You go and come back.
lf we leave before dusk we'll
reach there day after in the wee hours.
Why do you carry a stick?
- Dogs are troubling.
Last time, they chased me a lot.
Brother, shall we put
you in this cart?
l'll not get into the cart.
You call a taxi, man.
Uncle, lets leave this place somehow.
You be quiet, they can't play
the fool with me. Call the taxi.
Lets take toddy and go. -What?
Lets take toddy and....
Load 5-6 bags of paddy
in the vehicle.
Brother, she's the one.
What's your name?
You'll reach Meenakshipuram at dawn.
He agreed just because l said that
l'll give the bus fare.
Where's my uncle?
He'll come back now.
He has also agreed.
Okay, take out the money.
You sit in that cart. -Have it.
Come...
Not that...l don't know
who you're.
Karthumbi.- Who Karithupi
on you?
Nobody spit on me.
l said my name is Karthumbi.
l don't want to know your place
or name.
Why're you sitting inside the cart?
- l was told to sit inside.
By whom?- An oldy.
No oldy is authorised to make you sit
in the cart. Get down you girl.
Then why did he take the money?
- Who?
An uncle....- Which uncle?
l don't know, you find out
...He's in that shop.
Shop?
He's coming...Ask him
whatever you want to...
What? - Uncle, he's talking nonsense.
You dog, are you using
fiIthy words with a girl?
Better talk respectfully
or l'll kick you.
Did he take money from you?
- Oh God..Uncle didn't take money.
You said uncle took. Who's he?
- He's my uncle.
You said that he didn't
take the money.
It's true that l said uncle
took money from me, but...
When did l take the money
from you?
Oh God! l didn't say that you took
money. - She said that you took money.
l didn't tell you that my uncle took
money. -Then which uncle took money?
Hey liar, you're lying?
- lf you call me a liar...
Then do l've to call a liar,
a truthful person?
Whatever l told you is true.
He's my uncle. Another
uncle took money from me.
l got into the cart only after
he told me that this's his cart.
Okay leave that...Who're you
to ask all this?
Who am l?
lf you don't know who you're...
then ask me who you're.
l'll tell you who you're. - Uncle.
Ask me whether l know me.
That time l'll tell you
who you're and who l'm.
Uncle...Don't talk nonsense
after drinking Toddy.
It's my fauIt to have come with you.
What's the confusion there?
There..he's the one who took
money from them. Ask him...
What?
You had asked me to sit only after
taking money from me, right?- Yes.
Then why does this creep shout at me?
- Hey mind your words.
Can you only talk nonsense to
the girls whom you meet on the way?
You both don't fight. They're stranded
on the road due to the strike.
Since cart was going empty, l asked them
to get in by way of help.
Brother, you give me that money.
- Which money?
Give me the money they gave you.
Take back your money...Take away your
baggages. This cart'll not go.
l don't want the money back.
Give it back to the one
who took it from me.
We'll go only by this cart.
lf you hadn't taken the money
they would've dropped us.
They said that they would call
the taxi. - Uncle be quiet.
Come here.
Think that l've committed a mistake.
Poor fellows. We didn't
lose anything.
l've taken four times of
the bus fare.
Atleast we'll use that amount
during our journey.
Whatever it's, Bulls will pull
the cart.
They'll pull even 2 extra members,
what's our problem, please agree.
l know that you'll create a problem as
soon as you drink.
l didn't pick up a fight, right?
- But that was better than this.
You got me scoldings
from a girl.
You come and get into the cart.
Go, you dog.
Hey call the taxi.
Ask him to sleep quietly.
He's sleeping.
l think, he's from a
pedigreed family.
Very good cuIture!
You go idiot.
This will not work.
l'll make them get down.
What can l do if he blabbers
in sleep?
You thief pig's mother's sister's, wife's son!
Why did you stop?
Hey, l'll perform your
last rites today.
His grandmother's.... -Uncle.
No problem if we don't take him.
He blabbers in his sleep.
He's not blabbering in sleep...
Both of them are enacting a drama.
We'll be rebuked till dawn
if we leave him like this.
Come here man.
- l'll bury him alive.
ls he mad?
ls he picking up a fight with the
person who's sleeping?- Shut up.
Oh God! This has become a big nuisance.
Picking up a fight at midnight?
Whatever it is, we've taken the
responsibility. We've to adjust, you get in.
l'll tell you one thing.
lf he says anything more, l'll pierce
something in his mouth.
l'll put both of them down
when l see a light.
lf they agree, l'll take the cart or
you come by walk. - Agreed, you get in.
Who's that... - Your father, bloody
creep, beggar, nasty fellow.
Brother, sit on his face...
if l see his face...Both are....
Hey go...
No noise? Both of them
be ready to get down.
Prepare 2 strong teas.
Hasn't brother come?- He has come.
He needn't have tea...He's in full booze.
into the cart on the way.
l'm going to put them
down here.
Let them be here till dawn.
Then they'll go by some
vehicle tomorrow.
Get down.
Hey, we should behave like
humans, shouldn't we?
Leaving a young girl and an old drunkard
on the way at midnight...
What about their misbehaviour?
Getting offended by that
old drunkard's words..
What'll that poor girl do? - Oh God!
she's not poor...She's a chatter box.
Couldn't you forgive her because
she said something offensive?
Even if you try to convince me...
-You don't say anything further.
lf your sister Chinnu faces similar
situation, will you bear it?
That's why, l said that they'll
not create any trouble.
We'll reach Meenakshipuram at dawn.
You don't take oldy howls seriously
till we reach.
What? Go and have it and come.
Then....
l....
Shall l ask you something?
What's it?
Do you like to have Bun?
What?- Bun?
l don't want...l feel sleepy.
You sleep as soon as
the cart moves.
Water inside
as well as outside.
It's me Srikrishnan, standing
behind the bullock cart.
Shall l ask you something?
Nobody will see or hear us.
l'll not get such a good
chance hereafter.
That's why....
Please go ahead.
Do you like me, Thumbi?
Oh God, why did you ask
me that?
As you think, l'm not so old.
l've not yet married also.
Till now, l've not even thought
about a girl.
For the first time, l thought about
a girl as soon as l saw you.
l want to know your mind, right?
Don't you like me?
Why're you silent?
You must be feeling shy, right?
Say it openly if you
don't like me.
l'm asking you directly because l'm
not used to this.
Oh God, what am l to say?
Don't say yes, even if you like me.
l'll take your silence
as acceptance.
Shall l?
Don't mistake me.
l considered you as
my own brother.
Like my sibling.
l was afraid that you'll put me down
from the cart yesterday,
So l kept quiet.
lf l've done any mistake...
forgive me.
Don't have any bad intentions
about me.
Since l've told you all this,
don't get angry.
Hereafter, smile at me
whenever you look.
Only then, l'll be sure that you've
understood me.
Don't stand here anymore.
People'll mistake you. Go...
l think they have come.
For drama.... -Yes.
We were very upset.
What to do? Bus people went on
a strike suddenly.
Anyway you people have reached, right?
There's time for one rehearsal.
It's over.
Okay, then shall we take leave?
Come....
Shall l take leave,
Srikrishna brother?
Don't know when we'll meet again.
We'll meet....We've to meet.
Our journey is via this way, right?
How's it impossible for
us to meet then?
Okay, lets go.
Every dog has it's own day.
It's like this.
Did you see the power of bullock cart,
when there were no buses?
They think as if they're
flying an aeroplane.
Lets go.
Lets go.
Okay, my stomach is upset...
l'll drink soda & come back.
Oh...Have the artistes arrived?
- Yes, they arrived just now.
You put us in lot of tension.
Forget about the club.
l would've been disgraced, if the drama
hadn't been staged.
lf l, Jr.Boss had invested
something and if it goes in vain....
Her father, right?
- No, her uncle.
Don't we've to get together
this evening, uncle?
Yes, sure....Will anyone
oppose you Jr.boss?
You go...l'll come.
Brother, l'll fetch water & come.
Give me a pack of cigarette.
Party is superb, man....
Only now the money which l had invested
in the drama has yielded profits.
Uncle looks as if he'll take 5-6
bottles of liquor.
Okay leave that, will
it work, man?
Why ask?
She doesn't seem like opposing us.
Whatever its, l shouldn't
miss her.
Do as l say, come.
l feel difficuIt to breathe..
l feel giddy.
Earlier you said that
your stomach is upset.
True, that has caused this.
l'll become alright,
if l lie down somewhere.
You lie down in the cart...
l'll drive.
No...l'll not be able to sleep
properly due to the shakes.
Earlier, Didn't you sleep in the
cart nicely?
That was when l didn't
have body pain.
Body pain?
Head & stomach etc...
are the part of the body.
Okay, you lie down in the cart.
We'll go in the afternoon.
No...That's....
Have you been to Meenakshipuram
temple here?
No...l've not...
- Very famous temple.
l had taken a vow. - Vow?
headache, l had taken a vow,
To worship Goddess by
lighting the camphor.
You don't do that now
with this body pain.
Lets go later and perform it.
Aren't we coming here every month?
Like postponing Lord Ganapathy's
marriage,
Worshiping of Goddess is
also getting postponed.
Needn't postpone it even now.
That Goddess might've reminded me
of my vow by giving me pain.
She's very powerful, our prayers
will be answered immediately.
Don't test her.
Whatever it's, lets perform it.
l've decided.
Oh Goddess Bagavathi!
Good.
Oh Goddess.
You've fulfilled your
vow, right?
We'll reach by noon if
we start now, lets go....
Lets go.
Do you want Cutlet?
- No need, lets go.
Shall we go?- Have you seen dramas?
l've seen in my childhood.
Nowadays, dramas aren't like that.
It's full of modern technic.
Even l had watched them long back.
Today l've to watch their
technic. Thief.
Stop....No need of dramas etc...
Lets go brother.
What has happened to you?
Hey... from fields to business and
from business to fields.
From fair to house....
and from house to fair.
Drinking liquor, getting beaten up...
Falling down unconscious.
These were the routine.
There should be some
change inbetween them.
Today, l've decided
to watch the drama.
l feel shy....l feel shy....
By plucking the feathers,
my lover came this way.
Haven't you entered my heart as
a deer and taken an abode?
Aren't you exhilarating my heart
by entering it as a song?
You're the one...who searches this
blushing flower, aren't you?
Aren't you the coral thumbi?.
When l play Veena on your body,
And sing songs, my desires
will become passionate.
Oh my life don't go....
Aren't you the Lord Indra?
Aren't you the smiling flower
....the chilIness?
Uncle...Boss....
Boss...in your feet...lies the heaven.
You say that 2 lives are
starving.- Yes.
What's this? Don't you know
this is the dressing room?
l know....Don't change in a hurry.
Let the next scene
begin slowly.
Here in Meenakshipuram, things move
as per my convenience.
Will you please go out or not?
How can l?
l'm not performing dramas,
dance etc to enjoy the show.
But girls like you
fall in my trap.
Tell me if you want any money.
Don't create unnecessary scenes.
l'll shout if you don't go.
These are the drama dialogues,
aren't they?
Don't increase the demand, right?
You come.
Leave her.
You go from here...No need of
drama or dance here.
Are you misbehaving?
Are you from this place?
- Why do you need to know that?
Leave him.
Don't hit him. Leave him.
-Inside this..
Don't hit him.
Thief.... - Don't leave him, catch...
Hey, is there anybody else?
Move...
Where's brother?- All of them
have got in...Come lets go.
Mother, which place is this?
Mother.
Which is the way to Srihalli?
Mother, won't you talk?
Which is the way to Srihalli?
Mother.
Look at the way princess is sleeping!
Hey, get up...
Don't know which idiot's face
l saw and left this morning.
Look she's sleeping cooly after
creating all this ruckus.
Oh God...Where's brother?
Brother....
Hey, l'm asking you only
where's brother?
l don't know. You said that
everybody had got in.
l don't remember.
- Were you drunk,
That you don't remember?
Oh God, they may kill my brother.
lf anything happens to him, l swear
on God.. l'll see your end.
What am l to do if he
didn't get in?
Get down and stand upside down.
Yes, l'm mad to stand upside
down in this forest.
So you know it's the forest?
- Why did we come here?
Have we come here? When they chased
us in the dark,
Did your father run in the front,
To show us the way?
Can't he talk decently?
l can't. You dancer...You...
lf you act too much, l'll rebuke
you in bad words.
ldiot, are you teaching me decency
after doing all the harm to me?
It'll not work if l talk to him.
You don't talk to me hereafter.
That's fine! l'm not leaving you in the
forest because you're a girl.
l'll drop you when l find a road.
l'll break your teeth if you
talk till then...go...Bulls, move...
Hell with you.
ls there any necessity for you
to run through the forest?
How many times you've
been to the fair?
Don't you know the way yet?
That's why you're called as bull.
Animals should've some sense.
Which is the way to Srihalli?
What are you talking man?
No...Do you know malayalam?
We don't know.
Please listen to what
l say attentively.
Bullock cart...l...
By mistake we came here
through the forest. Understood?
l'm saved.
Hereafter listen to what
l say attentively.
Srihalli. -Yes Halli.
We want to go there.
Angalu... -Oh Angalu...?
We want to go there.
Polallam! Angalu Polallam
.
Angalu Polallam.
Yes, that's it.
Now got the technique.
Angallu Polallam!
lf l add  to everything...
Then it becomes their language.
Srihalli...Pollalam...Vali .
Vazhi
Which is the way
to go to Srihalli?
l don't know, he seems to be a crack.
- This isn't Telugu or Kannada.
May be this language was born
before the world was created.
That's right.
Don't sit in the way, mother.
She's...
Oruchalla....
Chaiah....
Alli ondha  -Yes...
She'll pay separately for her tea.
l'll not pay.
Hey...You...For a tea...
How far is Srihalli from here?
A day's journey.
A day's journey, right? -Yes.
How did she know?.
Are you the tribal? That's why you've
the monkey's character.
Don't talk to me. -lf you tell
me not to talk...
l don't understand what these
people are talking.
Don't we've to know the way
to go back to our place?
Let's go by the way we know.
Let's reach when we can reach.
l don't want to reach there
immediately.
You'll not...You don't have any house
nor anything. You're set free.
We're told not to talk.- Then return the
amount which l paid for your tea.
l didn't ask you for tea.
Why did you drink
when he gave you?
He gave me and l drank,
that's all.
Don't quarrel with me unnecessarily.
Then...No use, if we quarrel like this.
Forgive me if l have hurt you.
Karthumbi, ask for the way.
lf you want, l'll
drop you home.
Not necessary. - Then?
l'll ask for the way but...
But... -You've to
do something for me.
Ask whatever you want.
l.....Muthu Gavuu .
What's that?
Muthu gavuu.
Oh god...It wouldn't be that.
Did you ask? - Yes there's way.
But we can leave only after 2 days.
- Why?
It seems rain water has flooded
the river and the way is blocked.
River? l didn't see
any river here.
It seems they don't know the way.
How do these people know that water
has flooded the river?
It seems the tribals who had gone
to the fair with honey, haven't returned.
They are staying on the other side.
Our state is on that side.
This is Mysore.
Oh God...Let my enemies also
not face this plight.
They're warning us to move
somewhere from here -Why?
Because after dusk wild elephants'll
be roaming here -Elephants!
But it seems elephants will not come
near us, if they see the fire.
Hey what're you thinking?
l'm thinking whether your grandmother'll
get a good husband.
Did you get it?
Oh God!..It's enough
if l can pass that way.
Oh God! Wild Elephant!
Everything will end if
Elephants stamp us.
According to my predictions,
if a week passes.
Not only the elephants even their
young ones wouldn't come.
l'm unable to see
because of starvation.
lf you get something from the
shop tomorrow.
l'll prepare something
and give you.
But...One thing.
Neku Muthu gavuu.
What?
Muthu gavu.
lf you've anything to say.
say if directly.
l'm hearing this for a very long time.
Are you taunting me?
Muthu gavu! l'm telling you, l can
understand everything.
Evalu dey Akkaraileh.
Give me cela.
Give me that cela
Give...Only for that.
Only such language will be found
here in this world.
How did she know this?
Muthu gavu!
She's playing the fool with me.
Let's ask him.
Are you asking me!
l'll hit you. go man.
Mother..why don't l ask her?
Muthu gavu.
What? What did you say?
what're you asking?
l'll chop you into pieces.
-No...Don't chop me, l'll die.
How dare you talk like this after
coming to our place?
Come here again,l'll show yu
what'll l do to you.
Muthu gavu.
Muthu gavu.
Gowri, bring some water.
l'll finish with household
work and bring water.
Give me just one, muthu gavu.
-No...Leave me.
l feel shy. -Hey get up.
Brother untie me.
Oh my god -Untie me.
Oh my god.
What happened?
He was peeping into the bed room
of a newly married couple.
For the past few days money thefts are
being reported here. - Oh God!
Hey untie me.
l'll hand over him
to the police.
Please forgive him if he has done
anything wrong.
He's a nasty fellow.
l'm an oldie...He's talking
fiIthily to me?
He had come to my shop
& talked bad words.
Aren't you ashamed man?
What all the nasty things have
you done?
That's mother didn't understand
what l said.
It's because that she didn't
understand me.
You were tied here because you peeped
into the bedroom of husband & wife.
You had insuIted that lady
and that shop keeper.
They said that you're also involved in
the robberies which're taking place here.
Me?
Persons have gone to town to
call the police.
Have you heard about
Mallikattu policeman.
Nobody'll question him even if
he beats and kill you.
Such a nasty person will come here
and blemish,
The name of we malayalees who
work and earn pennies.
Please save my husband.
l'll leave this place with him.
Please save my husband.
What mother? - Hey it seems he's
her husband.
Lets pardon him and free him.
They'll leave this place.
There's he's coming.
Never step into these jungle again.
Be careful! Go...
What is he saying?
It seems he's leaving you because your
wife cried and pleaded - Who?
Leave the place immediately.
He says that you shouldn't be
seen in this forest.
lf you don't want to spoil
your heaIth.
Fall at his feet and seek
his pardon.
How can l do it when my
hands are tied?
lf mappu means dirty meaning
also in their language,
l'll have to undergo another
punishment for that.
It'll be enough, if you
say Lellu Allu
What?- Lellu Allu.
Lellu Allu....
Please untie me.
Oh God...l feel ashamed
when l think of that.
Inspite of roaming with the
dirty creep,
l saved my honour only because of my
good deeds accumulated in the last birth.
Peeping into somebody's bedroom,
Yuck...Only dirty creeps
will do such things.
His honourable appearance is
a deception to his rogueness.
Oh my Goddess, how to read
the mind of humans?
Stop it...lf you want to read them,
then enter into my mouth.
Don't act too much, you'll fall...
She's packing something.
Muthu gavu.
Muthu Gavu!.
Muthu Gavu!.
Somebody catch us...Water....
Oh God!
How many times have l warned
you not to tease me?
You teased me again.
l faced many problems because l went to
find out what was that.
l was slapped by an old lady, tribals
tied me & l lost my honour.
You had even teased me
for that also.
Only when l came to
know its meaning,
Anger, sorrows, shame which l had
internalized till then, have externalised.
l didn't do it wantonly.
l never expected that
it'll happen like this.
Had l known how to seek your pardon...
- Not necessary.
It's my fauIt also.
l lied to you that rain water
had flooded the river.
When l got angry with you, l planned
to torture you for 2 days.
Even l didn't expect that
it'll happen like this.
Karthumbi, when you go home...
No, earlier you had said,
''l don't have house nor anything''
Then... - l had only
an elder sister.
Didn't tribals tell you
about 'Mallikathu'.
He's my sister's husband,
he's a Police Officer in Mysore.
He's No.1 rowdy as well
as the Policeman.
People will tremble
if they see his shadow.
l saw him killing my sister,
And hanging her body
to the beam.
Then, he filed a false case saying that
she hanged herself to death.
Who could question him?
There's a gossip in the village that
only to marry me he killed my sister.
l came out from my house for drama etc.,
to escape from him.
The one who was with me
wasn't my uncle.
But Mallukathu's distant relative.
l don't have any
animus towards you.
To tell the truth,
l found the tiff with you
very delightful.
When l got the sense
of understanding,
l didn't admire such days
even in my childhood,
And those days will not
come again also.
l've only one thing to
tell you, Manickam.
Thanks.
For quarelling, saving, buying tea
for me and making me cry.
Thanks for everything.
On the other side of the rice field,
is my house.
What?
l said on the other side of the
rice field, is my house.
l want to ask you something.
What's it?
What do you want to ask me?
l was about to ask you
something but l forgot.
Even l was about to ask you something.
Forget it.
Shall l take leave?
Couldn't you call me back once?
l told you many a times that
l don't have anybody with me.
l would've stayed as
your servant atleast.
Even then, why would
you call me?
Who am l to you?
l'm a fool.
It's all because of me. l wished
for things unnecessarily.
l suddenly remembered what
l wanted to ask you.
Ask me quickly before
you forget again.
Do you want to come with me?
Oh black girl...Was there a day when l
didn't see you? l regretted...
Oh black girl...Was there a day when
l didn't see you?
l regretted that l wasn't
born a beetle.
l'm thinking of you in my heart.
Oh pretty girl with a dot....
your coquettish talks....
How did you make me your's?
When l saw you on the
mountain top.
Hymns came and chanted
in my ears.
Oh Golden girl....
Oh doe-eyed maiden.
You've the magic veena
which cupid plays.
Rejoice your heart
- Oh thief rejoice yourself.
With the beatings of drum, When you
come to me as a bull with golden horns...
Adoring a dot and wearing stone bangles,
Will you fly away singing?
l'm eager to sleep with you together!
Aren't you the dew drops?
Hey stop...Stop...
Let me see your mischief.
In a little pond, l feel like chill dew
splashing on me when l swim with you.
l'll tell him that you're not
getting down from the cart.
Lets act like enemies till
l explain everything to him.
Do as l say, okay?
Have you reached?
Thank heavens!
Brother....Do you've legs and hands?
Not that...Where's she?
There she's...
l feel shy...l feel shy...
By plucking feathers, my lover'll
come this way.
Manikutta, have you come?
l was very upset.
Can l believe the words of this liar?
l had taken many vows.
This mistake has been committed
because of the vow we had taken.
Right, brother?
Okay, who's she?
Ask the one who was
responsible for bringing her.
Srikrishna told me everything.
- Did he tell you everything?
Yes, l've told her everything.
Now listen to what she says.
It seems, she doesn't have
a place to go.
So she says that she'll stay
here doing some work.
Yes, this's a charitable institution
to give sheIter to everybody!
l used all my efforts to put
her down from the cart.
But she was very adamant
& didn't get down.
l feel like bashing her up.
Sister, poor girl. Lets give
her some work here.
You don't cry...You stay here.
What is her caste?
- Our caste only.
How do you know her?
l asked her.
Her father's name is Govinda Nair.
- Mother's name is Chovakutty.
You don't create any problem now.
She looks to be from
a pedigreed family.
We need a person to do jobs inside.
You come...
Then, you always create some problems
whenever you go to the fair & drink.
Better stop drinking or
stop going to the fair.
Oh God! My dear sister.
l swear on your head.
No, now l'm unable to lift up my head
because of you keep on promising on it.
Manikutta, you come here.
You keep quiet.
You keep your hand on his head.
- Oh mother, no....
Keep your hand. Promise that
you'll not drink.
Hereafter, l'll not drink.
What?- Toddy.
It'll be affect your head
if he drinks again.
Girl, you come.
Brother....My head....
l don't feel like laughing.
Come Balamuruga...Pick up a
card for Srikrishna.
Won't you give?
- l'll not.
What're you talking? Brother....
This's not the bull
but an elephant.
Not one elephant....
But 5 elephants.
This Bull can do the
job of 5 elephants.
Lord Srikrishna's bull....Bull....
Open its mouth and see.
Did you see its wide forehead?
Look at his 8 white teeth.
You'll get the girl
whom you wish.
But don't talk about this to anyone
till the end of July.
Why?
You can buy the ornaments
after the new moon day.
But don't talk to that girl
by your mouth.
Greetings sir.
Do l've to talk with my buttocks
if not with the month?
lf you want to ask anything
write it down and ask.
Parrot says so...
You'll not get any girl
if you don't comply.
Yes, that's right...Her family members
may not be interested in it.
Parrot predicted and l've
told you.
Parrot's words have come true.
Whatever parrot has predicted for me,
has come true.
No other problems, is it?
How much money do you've? Save it,
it'll be needed for our marriage.
lf you want this money, you marry
brother. This's his money.
Brother is hearing the
prediction of parrot.
Parrot?- Yes, Thimmayan's parrot.
Yes, parrot has predicted again that
we both'll get married.
Do you know what people say here,
That you'll not get a
girl like me.
We both are made for each other.
Hey go away from here.
lf anybody sees us...
It seems made for each other!
What? Romancing man?
Shall l fix her for you?
Oh God...l don't want.
- What's lacking in her?
What's lacking in Kathu sister-in-law?
l've warned you many times
not to talk about her.
Then you don't talk about this.
l'll talk about that
if you start this topic again.
l'll not start that topic, if you don't talk
about this, that's all.
Take the money.
- Where's Appakalai?
Hey Appakalai.
What has happened to him?
Come....
With saffron on the forehead
and waiving his hand,
Lord Srikrishna stands
infront of me.
What're you doing now?
l'm also watching him. There's
some change in his behaviour.
Oh God! Brother, where's
your Kombu ?
What?- Where's your moustache?
l've changed away my style,
To trap a new kombu.
Be explicit man.
Sister, haven't l fulfilled
all your wishes?
Except marriage...
Only that's left, right? Okay, you
needn't get angry with me for that.
l'll marry.
Oh my Goddess....What am l hearing?
Oh Goddess, you needn't give me
anything more. This's enough for me.
Atleast now you've
thought of marrying.
We've to celebrate this...
- Do something.
Okay who's the girl?
l'll tell you about her
after the month of July.
This's bad time even to think about
auspicious things, that's why.
You've decided to marry, haven't you?
That's enough for me.
Manikutta...Next is your marriage.
- Let Chinnu's marriage get over.
l'll take care of her marriage.
She's my sister too.
You just talk about your's.
l've promised her that l'll think about
me only after your marriage.
Right?- Yes, whatever
he said is right.
Oh my Goddess...
Shower your benevolence.
lmmediately, l'll make arrangements to
light the lamp & worship in the temple.
Oh...What a shame! Come here.
Who's the girl?
l was told that let this
July end.
Who?- Timmayan.
Hell with Timmayan &
his parrot.
Has his words ever come true?
What hasn't come true?
- No, what has come true?
Last ''Pongal'', didn't we win the race
with the bull he suggested.
When he had asked us to
plant sugarcane,
Didn't the paddy get ruined?
without heeding his words.
Didn't they fall sick and die?
Timmayan words always come true.
What did you say her name is?
Her name is...Let July end.
Okay let it end.
l know the girl.
Who?
Shall l tell you the
first letter of her name?
Go ahead...
K. - Just K or Ka.
Ka....
Hey, how did you find out?
Hey thief. She's Kathu sister.
Hell with Kathu sister.
Brother...l've kept pancakes
and curry inside.
You needn't fear....
l did the curry.
You'll like it.
l'll go home & come back
after fixing my sister's marriage.
She's salivating too much for you.
l'm watching this for
past 2-3 days.
What bothers you?
- Nothing bothers me.
Will you get something for me
when you come back?
What?- Black bangles.
We believe that if we wear black bangles
our marriage will be performed soon.
Only that's remaining now.
l've some other work, girl.
l'm not your servant.
l'm not telling you anything
now since l'm going out.
What happened?- Nothing.
What happened?
l just asked him to get me black
bangles when he comes back.
And he has started shouting.
Wild buffalo!
Simple! Couldn't you ask
me to get them?
Why're you laughing now?
Did you see anything?
l couldn't see....Did you see?
What?- Her changing the dress.
You idiot, get lost....
go man....
Stay there.
Don't tell anyone that l had peeped
into her room. Heard?
Heard?- Yes l heard.
What?- That you're going to
marry her, aren't you?
You needn't tease me...
Do you need any money?
l don't want money. - Then?
But l need an old dress
of your's to wear.
l'll tell sister. Get it from her.
l'll whip you if this gets leaked.
Oh my heart!
l'm eagerly waiting for the day
we're going to get united.
These black bangles which
hold 1000 kisses....
When l see you wearing them,
My heart will be in ecstasy.
Your's Srikrishna.
l saw the bride
selected by the lord.
Parrot says, that girl's mind will
not change if you give her chain & bangles.
Then ask the parrot what's the other
way for me to marry her?
What l could see is that this'll
not take place in a direct way.
Even if it curves a little
it's enough if l marry her.
There's only one way for that.
Ask all the bachelors here
not to marry her.
She'll marry you only if she doesn't
find anybody.
What's the price of this parrot?
- l'll not sell the parrot.
This's my livelihood.
- You needn't sell.
But l want to know how much will l've
to give if l kill it.
You and your parrot are predicting
some nonsense to her.
l'll kill you both & throw
in the water.
Take the thing which
you had asked me to bring.
What's this?- Black bangles.
Marriage needn't be stopped by not
wearing them.
Anyway you've bought the bangles.
Why don't you put them on
for me?
lf anybody sees...
Look, mother.
Karthumbi, if you want to go to
the temple, then come soon.
Sister, ask the keeper of the bull
Velaiyan to remain here when he comes.
l'll come back soon.
Superb.
Bangles.
Bangles suit you well.
l didn't think that
they'll match you so well.
Now you've seen.
Couldn't put them on my hand
when they were bought for me?
Rude person!
Even then you like, right?
Would l say like this
if l don't like?
Not rude Thumbi.
Waiting for the time.
Then why do you need
black bangles?
Can't get you golden bangles?
Wait till July ends.
Marriage'll be performed soon.
It's the marriage offerings.
This's the marriage time.
Aren't you the
Goddess of music?
You sing.
lf sky is clear & if our
hearts are contented,
Marriage is warranted.
Shyness will swing my
heart with the golden swing.
It's time for celebration.
With the Golden Chariot,
Bring auspicious pendant
for Karthumbi.
Paddy swings in the fields,
Aren't you the spike?
Rain clouds are coming
in the chariot.
Aren't you the rainbow?
Oh water Lily, come into my
heart & jump with joy.
Oh flower, come to adore
the Pearl necklace.
Lets join together tonight and watch
the festival publicly.
Moon light is waning.
Aren't you the new moon?
l can hear the dance steps.
It's time for the spikes
of the corn to play.
Oh Parrot. Come to marry me.
Give me your golden feathery cage
to live.
Who presented me this new hand spun
silk bordered saree?
Or according to the
present capacity,
What's that calculation man?
Groom's father deals
in cattle business.
So, he demanded cows,
if not money.
What about the groom?
- He's the signaler for the trains.
We needn't accept this proposal
giving this much of dowry.
Oh God...Reducing more
than is...
Who asked to reduce?
She's not your daughter.
But Manickam's sister
of Madambi house.
This proposal doesn't suit Madambi.
What're you saying?
Manickam came here & helped
me to make all these things.
His sister is, my sister too....
l'll give 20 sovereigns of jewels
and 25,000 as dowry.
Find a suitable groom and fix it.
Next time you come here
only with the marriage invitation.
Don't ask anything further.
Do we need such an
exaIted proposal?
Madambi people don't
change their words.
Do you've a doubt?
- No.
This year, many marriages
will be performed here.
l'm thinking of performing
all the marriages together.
l thought of something.
You need some money for
your journey, right? Wait.
Did you hear?
Government job isn't as great as
working in the kitchen of Madambi house.
They're grateful people. We've to
worship them with flowers.
We've to worship.
We've to worship the auspicious
pendant & ornaments in the temple.
Lets do that after the engagement.
l didn't think that she was your
sweetheart, she being here for so long.
That's why, purposely father named
you like this.
You're the thief Krishnan.
You've made everything
ready without my knowledge.
For the first time, l thought
that l need a girl.
That time Timmayan asked me to tell
this to everyone after the end of July.
In case of any obstacles,
l'll not get married ever.
What obstacles'll arise....
- Nothing...Forget me. Do you like her?
She's Goddess Lakshmi, right?
Even if she's a demon, l'll consider
her as Goddess Lakshmi, if you like her.
Advise Manickam.
Manickam & Thumbi are like mongoose &
snake when they meet each other.
Now onwards, we're going to live under
the same roof, isn't it?
Won't he change his mind
when he comes to know that,
She's his sister-in-law?
He'll carry her on his
shoulder and roam.
l'll show these things to her
and come.
l feel shy...l feel shy....
l came to know about the secret love
affair going on here.
You both were cheating us for
these many days, right?
Oh God! l was told that it'll be better
if we tell you at the right time.
Right time has come now.
My dear brother has purchased saree &
auspicious pendant for marriage.
Now, marriage band &
the hub-hub are remaining.
He didn't say that he has made
so much of arrangements.
He just said that it'll take place
after the end of this month.
Engagements arrangements are made.
We'll fix the time when priest comes
on Monday from Mangalapuram.
Don't we've to inform
Manickam's father?
Mancikam told me that we'll
marry after his sister's marriage.
What're you saying?
Manickam told me that brother
has some girl in his mind,
And marriage will take
place immediately.
Manickam planned to disclose our affair
to everyone after that.
That's why, l too kept it
as a secret.
Does Krishnan know that
you & Manickam are in love?
Yes...He teases me often.
That's why, he made our marriage
arrangements without our knowledge.
Manickam'll be shocked when he
knows this, right mother?
Whatever it's, you don't tell
this to Manickam.
Let Krishnan tell him directly.
You don't know his intention, right?
Okay, l'll not tell him.
What?
l want to tell you something.
Here? - l can't talk
to you at home.
That's why, l brought you to
the temple. Not only for that,
Praying before committing a
deliberate mistake.
When l feel guiIty of my crime, l chant
God's name & get relieved, right?
What're you saying mother?
Even if l'm not your own mother,
lf you consider me as your foster
mother, then you've to heed my words.
lf you've considered me as your son,
then tell me.
l know that you like Karthumbi.
You've to forget her.
You love me and your brother
more than her, right?
Couldn't you forsake
her for our sake?
But what's her mistake?
She didn't commit any mistake.
But my brother has committed
the mistake.
He has loved a girl for
the first time.
He bought gold jewels & sari
for her like a fool,
And he's dreaming about
the marriage.
He didn't know that his heart
is jumping like kids.
But you're in the girl's
heart whom he loves.
He'll not be able to bear it
if he comes to know this.
That's why, l'm cruel to you.
Forget her.
lf you can...Ask her
also to forget you.
Don't you know that l'm eager to
see that he leads a family life.
Since, l didn't find any other way...
Please obey...
Orelse l'll curse you.
For the Lords, slaves lives
are similar to the life of the cattle.
Buying cattle in the fair.
Feeding them grass & bran,
Making them heaIthy and let them
lie in the cattle shed.
They'll sell them when its profitable.
And'll not ask whether they're taking
them for slaughtering or rearing.
That's why, l say...Believing them,
l can't marry you now.
Let me own something first, then
l'll think about it.
You had'nt told me about
this earlier.
Have you seen any person
who's constant in his views?
Tell me if you don't like me.
l'll leave.
Did l tell you like that?
- l feIt so when you said like that.
Karthumbi, don't cry.
Whatever has to happen
has happened.
My father used to say,
That we're not the deciding authority
but its God. Believe him.
Hey do it fast. - Greetings sir.
What Lord? Feast?
What's going on man?
Your parrot's words are true.
On my behalf, get some
fruits & milk for the parrot.
His parrot will not tell the truth.
- Who said?
l say....lf parrot had
told you the truth,
Then why didn't the parrot say
that everybody is cheating you?
Cheating me? Who? - l'll not say Lord.
You'll not believe me.
Tell me what it's. - l'll not.
l'm afraid to say what l saw
and heard.
But l'm sure of one thing.
You've fed milk to a snake
for these many years.
Manickam is a cobra. - l'll kill you
if you bad mouth, Manickam.
Kill me...l'm happy to die
at your hands.
Whatever it's, let me tell
the truth and die.
Your marriage will not take place.
- Marriage will not take place?
Yes...He'll not perform it.
l saw with these eyes.
Heard with these ears.
That Manickam kissed her. You're my
God. l'll tell you the truth only.
He told her it'll be better if you
marry any donkey rather marry you.
It seems, you've lost your pick up &
you'll not have children.
l started boiling with rage
when l heard it.
Are you telling the truth?
- You call both of them and ask.
Then you'll know.
She hugged and told him,
''lets run away somewhere''.
And he replied, ''Not necessary. Lets rob
the money & ornaments & run away''
This isn't a recent affair.
She's a simpleton. But Manickam
has manipulated her.
So, was he cheating me
for these many years?
Were they both enacting a
drama before me?
Ungrateful dogs!
We've to pluck the teeth of that ungrateful
dog which bit the benevolent hand.
Then let him run away.
We shouldn't pardon.
He should go away
from this place.
lf you're born to one father,
you've to do this.
No need...Not now.
l want her....l'm very
particular about it.
l'll decide about what to do
with the other one.
Where were you last night?
Manickam went home.
Tomorrow is Chinnu's engagement.
He was waiting here till
dusk to inform you.
Have you drunk?- Yes...
You made me swear on that cheap
fellow that l'll not drink.
You had said, ''thunder will strike
his head if l drink hereafter''
l drank for it to strike.
- Krishna, don't talk unknowingly.
l know everything...
l've come to know everything.
l wished that you shouldn't
know anything.
l wished that whatever l heard
shouldn't be true. Now l'm sure.
Please listen to what l say.
- No need.
Everybody was fooling me, right?
l'm a fool....You made me
a clown & enjoyed.
Even you've joined their mirth without
bothering about me.
He's not as you think. He's a poor
fellow.- No...He's a snake.
He bit the hand
which fed him.
Hereafter nobody should support him.
l've only one thing to tell you.
Hereafter, l & he'll not
live under this roof.
Yes Lord. - l want her.
For that she has to
forget Manickam.
Only then l'll get her.
- l'm getting an idea in my small brain.
My uncle's daughter, isn't it,
Kuyili.
Yes the servant maid here.
She's interested in
Manickam & not me.
She's after him to marry him.
The whole village knows about this.
So...The idea which is brewing
into my small brain...
Hey, tell me man.
Lets make Kuyili tell in panchayat
that she has lost her chastity.
Panchayat will ask her
who the person is.
It's enough if she says
it's Manickam.
Panchayat'll agree when
a girl says so.
It'll order Manickam
to marry her.
He'll not listen. Then Panchayat will
ask him to leave the place.
He'll run away.
This was the idea which was brewing
in my small brain.
This isn't the idea emerging
from a small brain.
And Karthumbi will hate him &
forget him for that.
Very good. 2 birds with one stone!
Tomorrow there'll be 3 birds in
the small brain.
Which is the 3rd one?
lf Manickam goes away,
Then Kuyili will become
an unchaste woman.
So nobody'll marry her.
Only l know that she's not
unchaste & l'll marry her.
You're really superb!
This idea got into my
small brain.
That's why, God purposely didn't
give you a big brain.
But will Kuyili agree to it?
Just because she likes Manickam
she'll agree.
You've to make her agree
just because you like Karthumbi.
You've to show your talents there.
l'm afraid Lord.
l know how much you
love Manickam.
But that girl has
cajoled him nicely.
lf you want him...Then
this is the only way.
l'm telling you to do this
out of affection,
Or would l stand besides
you to do such a thing?
You say it boldly.
Since l know the accused very well,
it's not right for me to take a decision.
So let Madam Gandhari & other's here
think & take a decision.
Since its proved that Manickam
has raped Kuyili,
We've decided that he should marry her
& redeem his folly.
l don't know who's
behind this plot.
l'll marry her. Only l should
marry the one l've raped.
l'll be with her &
give money for her expenses.
lf she's pregnant, then she'll
deliver the baby, won't she?
l'll marry her at that time.
lf she's not pregnant,
Will any of you insist that l marry
the girl whom l don't like?
l'm reacting positively to the decision
taken by the Panchayat.
Please show mercy on me.
Since his request is just,
We've decided that
let him do what he has said.
l want to ask you something.
- lf l don't want to hear anything...
When l think that l had been with
such a dirty creep, l feel ashamed.
Brother... - Don't call me brother
anymore, everything has ended.
lf you step in there by claiming
our old relationship...
Come man.
l knew that such problems
will crop up.
But l didn't think it'll be
magnified like this.
Shame!
Now l'm unable to face the people.
What's the use of crying?
Atleast now you understand one thing.
Shouldn't love a person falling
for the beauty and age.
But nobility should be the criterion.
l...don't think, l'm...
You've sinned.
Yes, what else could l do?
Atleast now l thought of
caring for myself.
Orelse he would've
betrayed me further.
l'm talking about you only.
What did l do?
It's hurting you, right?
You were silent when he had hurt me
after being with you for these many years.
You're thinking and worrying about
some beggar, right?
You and Manikuttan are
same to me.
Manikuttan! That son of
your's is dead.
He'll not become your son
if you call him son.
But l'm your brother, who wasted my
life for your sake.
Don't forget that & compare
me with him.
You've not spoken to
me like this so far.
No...l've not told you anything harsh
other than calling you sister.
But when l see my sister crying
for the one who has hurt me,
l'm boiling.
l don't have the generosity
to bear it.
l'll not say anything more.
Do as you like.
l'll be only with you.
l don't have anybody other than you.
l've come with the invitation.
l should give you the first one.
Dear...Give it to him gracefully.
You would've known what
had happened here, right?
l don't know what happened.
Your son raped
Kuyili who's working here.
Panchayat has ordered
him to live with her.
Now Lord is going out by covering
his face. - He may be simply saying.
Lord...My son'll not do
such a nasty thing.
Then, he might not be
your son.
l thought of telling
you something.
This time even though there
were dark clouds.
But there were no enough rains.
l can deliver the produce in the fair
only if l start the work in the fields.
So, the amount which l promised
to pay for her marriage,
Now, l'm unable to pay.
Lord, don't say like that.
l fixed the time and printed the
invitation only by heeding your words.
Did l think that this year will
be unprofitable when l promised you?
You only said that Madambi
people will not change their words.
Can we change the limbs,
if not the words?
Just became you gave your son
to look after our fields & cattle,
l didn't promise you that l'll take
care of your entire family.
Don't come here again regarding this.
- Lord...
Enough father...After hearing all this,
are you still of worshiping him?
You needn't stoop so low to
perform my marriage.
Don't dear.
Don't the slaves have
shame & modesty?
lf you want to come, then come.
l'm going.
Do you think, l'm a debauch?
No, but when he said...
You don't listen to others.
l know my brother well.
He's insuIting you having
some animus.
Rather getting me married using his
money, It's better to kill me.
You were minding your business, but
l bothered you with the marriage proposal.
l'll perform your marriage.
Otherwise why should l be
called a brother?
Day is fixed after Pongal, isn't it?
You print the invitations, l'll perform
her marriage by taking loans.
l've the stamina to
work and repay them.
You go with hope.
Manickam, somebody has come from
Gandhari house in search of you.
Manickam, you sit down.
Rajaiya, put a mat for Manickam.
You were meekly adjusting with the Lord
in Madambi house, right?
Don't consider yourself inferior
because you've come here.
You know that Pongal is nearing.
- Yes.
l heard that you're not driving
Madambi people's cart this time.
Yes.... - Then, can't you
drive my cart?
What?- What'll l get?
Half of the bet amount.
lsn't it enough? Think & say.
There's nothing to think,
l want money.
Sister.
Stop it please.
In this race, Injimuda people's,
Bet is, 1000 acres of land....
lf Madambi people lose, they've to give
their entire property & leave the place.
lf you're ready, announce it.
Manickam is my cart man.
l'm ready to take up the bet.
Not only that, if
Madambi people lose,
l'll shave my sister's head,
make her sit on the donkey,
And take her around the village.
Only then l'll leave this place.
Appakalai is my cart man.
Lets begin.
Begin...
Manickam get into the cart.
- No, l can't....
Reason... - l feel giddy.
No problem...It's just a
matter of 5 minutes.
l can bear it even if you
join the race and lose.
l'll not lose if l join the race.
l very well know that.
That's why, l told you that
l'll not get into the cart.
Let anybody say anything...
l've not been ungrateful till now,
And l'll not be...Please forgive me.
You cheat...Treacherous fellow.
You've cheated me.
You men should keep up
your words.
l'll not leave you so easily.
On the next panchayat,
l'll throw you out from this place.
l've the money in my pocket which l've
got by selling his father.
ls he trying to defeat me?
ls he laying a bet with me?
l glossed & lived for these many days
by creating new bets daily & winning.
Did you see how l pulled his leg?
Didn't you see him
falling down there?
lf you hadn't stopped him
from the race.
l would've defeated him.
Yuck...You'll do it! Go man...
ls there any man in this world
who can beat him in this?
lf he had joined the race,
By this time, we would've had to give
away everything & leave this place.
Do you know?- So you know that.
He could've performed his sister's marriage
by selling this house if he wanted.
Just because he's loyal to us,
he didn't do like that.
Our family wasn't cursed
by anybody so far.
Now you don't get the curse.
You've to perform that marriage.
l told you whatever l wanted to.
Hereafter you do as you like.
You go & ask that Kannaiyan
to come here.
Don't think l'm giving up.
l wanted to win again.
It's good that Lord agreed.
Now we needn't beg with anybody
& perform it, right?
You didn't hear the complete thing.
First hear & then say we need this or not.
What's it father?
My heart is beating fast...
How can l tell you?
l'll tell you.
Lord has ordered that marriage will
be performed only if you don't come.
Father... - l've promised him
that you'll not come.
We've to perform it somehow,
haven't we, son?
No need...What sin have l committed
to suffer so much?
Father who has brought up a grown up
motherless daughter,
You'll not understand that father's
feelings. That's why, l agreed.
l don't want a marriage
without you.
l'll be there...You don't cry.
My heart & blessings will
always be with you, dear.
l've fixed this marriage proposal.
It shouldn't stop because of me.
Atleast for our father,
you've to agree to this.
Offer him this money.
l'll meet you and the groom later.
You go.
l've served supper...
Sister has gone to bed.
Who'll feel hungry at
this miserable time?
l didn't join the feast even
though l attended the marriage.
l & Manickam should've had that
feast on the same leaf.
He may be angry with me.
But what to comment when he didn't
come for his sister's marriage.
l don't understand even now
how he became so venomous.
Wait....
My sister has a wish.
She didn't tell you because she
was hesitant to tell you directly.
Let anything happen,
you be here.
But sister's wish is that you should
stay here as the member of this family.
l don't get you.
l'm also fed up living alone.
l've received many proposals
from well off families.
But l'm not interested
in money & fame.
l want a girl who'll understand &
look after me.
Only that's needed, right?
So you... - No...l've committed sins.
Even the people who want to help me are
in no position to do it
l don't feel so.
l'm going to fix and declare
this immediately.
lsn't the boss there? - Who're you?
l don't recognise you.
Ask him...He'll tell you.
What?
l came to see the groom.
l've brought a gift.
l made these ornaments
for our marriage.
l heard that you're
going to marry someone else.
When you give her the jewels and saree,
give her even this.
For some years he was
romancing with me.
At that time when he said that he
doesn't want marriage,
And he's going to live for
his sister,
l didn't cry and fall at his feet.
l was just waiting for him.
l prayed to all the Gods that
he should change his mind.
Till now l didn't think of
another man or to lead a family.
Now when he saw the beauty of the girl
who's like his daughter,
He forgot me.
l've teased you and sang
that you're a stone hearted man.
But if you had a pebble sized heart,
you would've remembered me.
l hate myself for loving you
all these years.
That's good...Even you're involved
in grabbing, right? - What's it?
Oh god! Pregnant women should be very
careful for first 3 months.
Shouldn't do these type of jobs.
lf you had learnt to steal,
you've to be cautious.
lf anybody sees now, cat'll be
out of the bag.
lf it does, even your head'll be
shaved and you'll be taken on a donkey.
It will be awkward scene
hey, going away!
When in love...Girls really
behave like kids.
Some don't get what they wish for.
So they'll grab it when they
don't get it.
While grabbing they'll slip.
And make a mess of everything.
Atleast now tell me, who told you that
by lying you can marry me?
Who made you say lie?
Thief!
Thief...
Cuckoo...Cuckoo...
Thief...Thief.
Oh thief cuckoo...Will you tell it softly
and sweetly in my ears?
That day you laid
eggs in the crow's nest,
And flew away singing
that you didn't.
Why did you lie?
Even wind is endorsing that those
are crow's eggs.
Nobody believed the crow when it told the
truth, opened its heart and showed.
Then it swooned and lay in the nest.
Who's standing at the distance?
Tiny branch of the banyan tree
is swaying merrily.
When the temple dones flew and
cooed all over the village.
Gossip spread like wild fire.
Parrot which loved the crow didn't
know the true story.
Breeze is flowing in this garden.
My dear bird smiled
by flapping it's wings.
In the Srihalli fair, have you seen the
bull fixed by the Surya family.
l've not brought it for sale.
Those who have not seen
the good ones can have a look.
l didn't sell it even after they
promised to give me gold.
No... -Go man.
What a man he's?
Look at the bull, count its
teeth and then fix the deal.
Those who've lot of money
can bid.
Did you see the people
yelling in the hot sun?
He was strong and heaIthy when he
was in my house with 3 square meals.
Now did you see him, how
lean and dark he has become?
He'll suffer like this if
he doesn't behave decently.
Hereafter you'll see him roaming
as a beggar, in this fair.
Did you see the bulls shining?
- He made them shine by applying oil.
They'll faint and fall if they
take 4 steps forward.
Lord...Don't trouble me,
let me somehow live.
l'll trouble you.
Trapping women in my house after
eating my food.
These are not enough for
dirty creeps like you.
Who knows that he'll not trap even
my sister whom he calls his mother?
l'll kill you if you
talk nonsense.
Where's he?
That person with the saffron paste
on his forehead.
Hey dog's progeny, you'll marry
my girl, won't you?
Your corpse will only marry her.
l've warned him already.
Please come...They're hitting our Lord.
Take him and go.
He might be a Policeman there,
but here he's nothing.
This is a different State.
Warn him that he'll lose his limbs
if he comes here again.
Where are you going?
-l'm going!
Only now l've understood that
l've not committed a big sin.
Orelse if at the end of this night,
My life would've been hell,
after marrying you, you cheat.
Kuyili told me everything.
Do you want to know anything else?
l want to tell you some more.
www.bibzworld.co.in
So l'm not saying anything.
Go...All of you dogs...go.
But this Srikrishnan'll not lose.
You people are nothing to me.
Nobody'll live happily after
hurting me.
l'll teach a lesson to
all of you, go...
It's enough man.
Let all those who
want to go, go.
Am l not there for you?
Forget everything dear.
Where are you going?
l want to meet that beggar.
Stay there.
Come...
Many have died here.
Only plants are here...
even corpses will not be found.
He killed the Lord.
And threw him in the pond
to get that girl.
You killed him, right?
You killed my Lord for a dirty
girl right? - Father.
No, father....
No...Didn't you hit him
in this fair?
Didn't you say that
you'll kill him?
My heart cried when l saw his
sister crying.
You'll be ruined, you ungrateful dog.
- Are you a human being?
You're making your father to cry.
Yes...It's a heart-rending sight, isn't it?
l didn't think that you'll kill him
when you threatened to.
But you did as you said.
Please listen to what l
want to say.
l know he was very vile.
He was very cruel to you.
Even then, didn't l bring you both together
and fed rice from the same pot.
How could you think
of doing this?
Atleast you should believe me. -No
everything is over now...
It'll be good if l know one thing.
ls his corpse in the pond or have
you buried him somewhere?
So that l can get
a handful of his ashes to perform the rites.
Let his soul atleast rest in peace
-Mother.
Mother.
l didn't throw.
l didn't do it.
l didn't kill him.
Oh my god! How can l make her believe?
No time to think. Do something immediately.
l'll sent a person right now.
We've to call the police from the town
or else he'll leave this place.
Brother.
l'm going -Where?
l'll get into the 10'clock bus.
l'll get down at the terminus and
walk from there.
l've thought only that much now.
l'm unable to bear it.
l'm unable to bear the punishment
for the crime which l've not committed.
Now if l come with you
l'll not trouble you.
l'll get down on the way.
Uncle...Manickam and that girl
are leaving this place.
We'll not be able to catch him if he
leaves by 10'clock bus, come.
l thought of meeting you
before l left.
Hey dog, you're broadcasting everywhere
that l've killed him, aren't you?
Tell me...Who killed the Lord?
-No.
Where's Lord? -l don't know.
Tell me, where's the Lord?
Catch him, man.
Come fast.
Didn't you die?
- Die? Why?
My son...We shouldn't live with
the girl whom we like.
But should live with
the girl who likes us.
This is the lesson l've learnt
from the nonsense l did.
Please bless us.
You come this side and stand.
Why?
Let me see you clearly.
Please pardon me. All have
troubled you alot isn't it?
Pardon me.
Mother, you don't say like that.
Brother has come alive, hasn't he?
But l've only regret.
You believed when somebody said
that l killed him.
You killed me?
Which bastard said this?
He only.
Catch him.
Make him stand here.
Did you say like that?
Lord, tell us what to do with him.
Shall we throw him in the pond?
He has do situps here.
You made me a killer by throwing his
slippers & upper cloth in the pond?
Pardon me.
Do situps till it becomes dark and
the come there to bathe the cattles.
We'll tell you the rest of
the punishment at that time.
Nobody should give him water.
-We'll not give.
Hey do situps...count man.
lf the sky is clear and hearts are
contented, marriage is warranted.
Shyness'll swing my heart
with golden swing.
It's time for celebration.
With the Golden Chariot,
Bring auspicious Pendant for Karthumbi.
