, here's what you missed on
Glee: Quinn was dating Sam,
but then she kissed Finn, so
Santana told Sam, and now
they've started dating.
You are Biebalicious.
Will's not dating anyone and
says he's over Emma, but it
seems like he's still got a
thing for her, even though
she's married.
Kurt's really into Blaine,
and Blaine likes Kurt,
but he says he just wants to
stay friends.
And that's what you missed
on Glee.
Figgins,
you wanted to see me?
William, we have an epidemic
on our hands.
Head lice?
Worse. Giggle juice.
I-I'm sorry. What?
Alcohol, William.
The wet devil.
Our children
are so brazen,
they are showing up
to school wasted.
And not wasted
on learning, Will.
Wasted on booze.
Why, just this week,
we've had five suspensions
for intoxication
on school grounds.
Figgins!
You rock!
Yeah, man!
Six suspensions.
I-I don't get it.
Drinking's never been a problem
at this school.
That's because there are
new alcoholic beverages
targeted to kids, Will.
Just listen
to the radio.
Pop music now glorifies
binge drinking.
Just listen to any hit
by pop sensation
Ke-dollar-sign-ha.
Oh. You-You mean Ke$ha?
We must do something
to protect our children, Will.
I-I totally agree.
How-How can I help?
I have decided to make this week
Alcohol Awareness Week
at McKinley.
I have contacted
Kitty Dukakis,
who will be
the guest speaker
at an assembly where your
Glee Club will perform a song
highlighting the dangers
of teenage drinking.
Can I count on you, William?
WILL:
Emma?
Hi.
Enough with us
not being friends.
Look, I heard through the
grapevine that you and Carl
started looking
for a tract house together,
and I just wanted to say
that I'm genuinely
happy for you.
Thank you.
That's really sweet.
Two-slicer.
Do you want to catch up?
Yeah. Sure.
How have you been?
Busy. Yeah.
Glee Club's gearing up
for Regionals...
I, um, love hearing
about the Glee Club,
but I'm actually more
interested in you.
You know, how
you're doing.
Me? Uh...
Are you dating anybody?
No.
No?
Maybe you should.
You know,
Ella, I think
Will should really concentrate
on his treatment
before he tries another
relationship
with an early hominid,
even a human female.
Treatment?
Alcoholics Anonymous, Will.
I suggest you
pre-emptively check
into rehab,
as you are a future alcoholic.
I mean, come on.
Look where you are.
You're coaching a Glee Club
that can only beat
choirs of old people.
You're rehashing the details
of your failed marriage
with the very lemur
who rejected the bestial horror
of your craven sexual advances.
And when my Glee Club
crushes you at Regionals,
well, the last ounce of meaning
will drain from your life,
and you will turn to drink.
I don't get it. How is it
that you're now
coaching a Glee Club?
I was so inspired by my stint
in the Glee Club,
that I took the trip
to Westvale,
and I volunteered my help.
Unfortunately,
the chipper homosexual
who coaches Aural Intensity
had a terrible fall
down the stairs.
I'm okay. Don't worry.
Not to be alarmed.
Doctors say he will be fine.
Provided they can get
the swelling in his brain
under control.
Okay, sorry. I still
don't understand.
How can the school let
you coach Aural Intensity?
Newsflash, Amelda.
There's no one lining up
to coach Glee Clubs
because it's a sucky job
for losers.
But there was an opening,
and I am a champion.
Oh, Will.
Here's the book by Bill W.,
outlining the 12 steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
I can't wait for you
to start climbing those steps,
because when you get to the top,
I'm gonna knock you back down.
What's up, my hot, little
Jewish-American Princess?
What do you want,
Puckerman?
Well, word on the street is
that your dads are out of town,
and you're all
alone in your house.
They are on the
Rosie O'Donnell cruise.
Was that...
Who told you that?
This is the kind of information
a guy like me tends to know.
So, uh, party
this Saturday?
I'll bring the beer ball.
That's a mini-keg.
Forget it.
Oh, come on. Just
the Glee kids.
We're losing our minds,
all stressed
about Sectionals and stuff.
Regionals. Besides,
you just want a place
to have sex and get drunk.
Yeah. There's a word
for that. A party.
No. No.
No. My-My-My dads, they left me
alone in my house
because they trusted me
to be responsible.
They left you alone 'cause you
suck and are a total bore.
FINN:
Hey.
Yo.
How's the song-
writing going?
Hey. It's going amazing.
I think I might have
a really big hit here,
which is why
I wanted you to come by.
I-I want you to hear it.
Oh. Yeah. Cool.
Come here.
What was that for?
To break the tension.
We were boyfriend
and girlfriend, Finn.
It's silly for us to pretend
like we aren't comfortable
around each other.
Yeah. Totally.
And I know that we have
some unresolved feelings,
but like my two new role models
Carole King and Gerry Goffin,
I think it's important
that we just
put them aside and stay
focused on our mission
which is just
to write an amazing song
to win Regionals with.
Well, I have no idea
who those people are,
but I'm on board.
Let's hear it.
Okay.
It's just... It's a little
rough, but, uh...
I think it's really special,
so...
There you rest
With all the rest
Of my accessories
On my night stand
You're red or yellow
And like a good fellow
Sometimes you get lost
In my mess
But when school girl
pigtails won't do
And I need to control my 'do
You're the only one
I can count on
My headband
You're my headband
Wrapped right
around my melon
You're a product
like Magellan
Hold...
Hold on. Uh...
Is this song about
your headband?
Yes.
It's called, "My Headband."
They say you should write
about what you know.
Well, uh...
It's really... interesting,
but it's not...
emotional or,
like, good.
It sucks.
Yeah.
How am I supposed to write
a song like Joni Mitchell
or Carole King?
They've lived.
Well, maybe if you want
to be an artist like them,
you should do a
little living.
You're so right.
I mean, even now,
it-it's Alcohol Awareness Week,
and we're supposed to sing songs
about the dangers of drinking,
and I've never
even had a drink.
Wait, seriously?
That's why I never got
past second base. Wait.
Where are you going?
To find Puckerman.
You know, my journey
from little princess
to natural woman begins this
Saturday night at my house.
That sounds awful.
Is anybody going?
Let me find out.
Did you hear?
Yes.
Mercedes just told me.
Tell them I'll
go if they go.
Tell them yourself.
I ain't no pony express.
You're going, right?
Only if there's liquor.
Because a Rachel Berry party
is not something I can do sober.
But it's Alcohol
Awareness Week.
Precisely. And I am aware
of how much fun alcohol is.
Let's ask Puckerman.
You're go for Puck.
Noah, it's Santittany
and Artcedes.
Can your friend score us
some wine coolers?
No, but his I.D. can.
Well, if we're all
in, it's settled.
The Rachel Berry House Party
Train Wreck Extravaganza
is officially a go.
Welcome.
Kurt. Blaine.
I wasn't expecting
you guys.
FINN: Kurt's been
blackmailing me
ever since he saw
my browser history.
He kind of
insisted on coming.
I'm totally off
the clock right now, Rachel.
I'm not a Warbler.
I'm just Blaine.
I'm not even
wearing my uniform.
So, this is
your dads' Oscar Room.
Yes. They transformed
our ordinary basement
for our famous
annual Oscar parties.
Is that a stage?
I like to give
impromptu performances
for our neighbors sometimes.
Hey, girlfriend.
Having fun?
Yeah.
Awesome party.
Uh, okay. Let's, uh...
Let's go over the rules.
Everybody gets
two drink tickets
to keep things
from getting out of hand.
We're serving
wine coolers today.
That is our
specialty drink.
That's actually
all that we have.
Brittany!
Remember the rules.
No sitting on anything.
Okay. Okay, everybody.
Cheers!
Great party, Rachel.
We got to run.
Yeah, dinner reservations.
But, but, but we haven't
even played Celebrity yet.
I...
Why is everybody leaving?
Because this
party blows.
I haven't even had
my first sip yet.
How am I supposed to
write "Both Sides Now"
if I can't even
throw a party?
Look, if you want
everyone to stay,
you have to let me break into
your dads' liquor cabinet.
No one's gonna get
buzzed off two wine coolers.
I'll replace it
before they get home.
Let's party!
Poppin' bottles in the ice
Like a blizzard
Now I'm feeling so fly
Like a G6
Let's go!
Like a G6
Like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly
like a G6
Give me that Mo-Moet-et
Give me that Cri-Cristal-tal
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Ladies love my style
My table getting wild, get get
get them bottles poppin'
We get that drip
and that drop
It tastes like pink.
It tastes like pink!
Sober girls around me
They be acting
like they drunk
They be acting like
they drunk
Acting, acting like they
drunk, with sober girls
Are you not drinking?
No. Designated driver.
What about you?
I'm still trying
to impress Blaine.
Can't get too sloppy.
Clearly, he doesn't
have the same concern.
Hey!
It is so cool that you
and Kurt are brothers.
Right?
Like, brothers! Wow!
You're so tall.
You having
fun, Blaine?
Yeah.
This is
the best party ever!
Finny.
Dance with me.
Fly like a G6
We had it going on, right?
I wasn't making it
up or anything?
I would do anything
for you. Anything!
Okay, Rachel.
Since this is your
first time at this...
Sit down?
I'm going to break
it down for you.
Guys and girls fall
into certain archetypes
when they get drunk.
Exhibit A-- Santana,
the weepy, hysterical drunk.
You like her
more than me.
She's blonde and
awesome and so smart.
Admit it. Just admit it!
No. Kiss me.
Lauren Zizes and Quinn--
the anger girl drunks.
I can't believe what
you did to my body.
I used to
have abs.
Oh, back off!
Who told you that hairstyle
was cool? Geronimo?
Chill out!
Brittany, also known as the girl
who turns into a stripper drunk.
Makin' it rain! Whoo!
That's my girlfriend.
I love you, baby.
Mercedes and Tina--
happy girl drunks.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
And then we come around
full circle
right back to you, Rachel.
And right now, you're being
the needy girl drunk.
Hanging all over me,
being overly lovey.
It's not cool.
Now I'm feelin' so fly
like a G6...
What-What kind
of girl is this?
Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now I'm
feelin' so fly like a G6...
Let's play spin the bottle!
Who wants to play
spin the bottle?
Spin the bottle.
Feelin' so fly like a G6.
SANTANA:
You know what?
A reminder.
I owns that guppy mouth.
Those trouty Aerosmith lips
belong to me.
So...
You know what
this is not?
Hey, honeys.
It's not a Big Red commercial.
No me gusta.
Whoo!
Party! It's my turn!
My turn!
Oh!
Oh!
This is
outstanding!
Blaine Warbler,
I'm gonna rock your world.
Yeah!
Oh!
SAM:
Deep! Deep!
More! More! More! More!
More! More!
Johnny, are you queer, boy?
Johnny, are you queer...
Okay, I think
we've had enough of that.
ARTIE:
Yeah!
Your face...
tastes awesome.
I think I just found
a new duet partner!
You were working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar
When I met you
You
I picked you out
I shook you up
and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Don't
Don't, don't
Don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear
that you won't see me
Don't
Don't, don't
Don't you want me?
You know I don't believe it
When you say
that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think
you've changed your mind
You better change it back,
or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew
I'd find a much better place
Either with
Or without you
Don't
Don't
Don't you want me?
Don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear
that you won't see me
It's much too late to find
You think
you've changed your mind
You better change it back
Or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
I want you. I do.
Don't you want me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't you want me, baby?
Oh, oh
Don't you want me?
/C Oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't you want me, baby?
Hey, Kurt, come give me a hand
with these eggs.
KURT:
I'll be down in a minute!
What the hell is a shirred egg?
Is that... Is that the
same thing as a scrambled egg?
Hey, what's this?
Today was the day you were going
to teach me all about brunch.
I'll be down in a sec.
Oh, where am I?
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. My bad.
I need to close
my locker,
and it's going to
sound like a gunshot.
I have had
the worst hangover
since Saturday,
and it's Monday.
I've been dry-heaving
all weekend.
When my mother asked
what the sound was,
I said that I was
practicing bird calls.
You guys, I can't
stop barfing.
Please don't say "barf."
I caught a whiff
of hairspray
and went full Linda Blair
in the girls' bathroom.
I told my mom
I had the flu,
and she made me
a traditional tea
made out
of panda hair.
Can we talk
about anything else?
How about some
Bloody Marys, y'all?
Are you kidding me?
The last thing
I want to do is drink.
It'll help your hangover.
That's what Bloody Marys
are for.
Hair of the dog
that done bit your ass.
Blame it on the Goose,
got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron,
got you in the zone
Blame it
on the a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the
a-a a-a-a a-a-a a alcohol
Ay, she say
she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shorty
know what she want
But she don't wanna seem
like she's easy
I ain't saying
what you won't do
But you know
we probably gonna do
What you've been feelin'
deep inside
Don't lie now
Boy, what you drinking?
Gonna let it sink in
Here for the weekend
thinking
We can see what we can be
if we press fast forward
Just one more round
and you're down, I know it
Fill another cup up,
feeling on yo butt, what?
You don't even care now,
I was unaware how
Fine you was
before my buzz set in
My buzz set in
Blame it on the Goose
Blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron,
got you in the zone
Alcohol
Blame it
on the a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the
a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka,
blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top,
got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the
a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the
a-a a-a-a a-a-a a alcohol
Now to the ballas poppin'
bottles with their Henny
In their cups, screaming money
ain't a thing
If you ain't throw it up
in the sky
In the sky
And hold your drinks up high
And to my independent mamas
who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
when them broke fellas holla
Tell them bye
Bye
And hold your drinks
up high
Blame it on the Goose,
got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron,
got you in the zone
Blame it
on the a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the
a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka,
blame it on the Henny
Blame it on that blue top,
got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the
a-a-a-a-a alcohol
Blame it on the
a-a a-a-a a-a-a a alcohol.
Well done, you guys.
I mean, you
always bring it
with the singing
and the dancing,
but what I was really
impressed with today
was your acting.
I truly thought
that some of you guys
were drunk.
We take our craft serious.
Problem is, that song is great,
but it-it kind of glorifies
drinking, don't you think?
We're supposed
to sing about the dangers
of alcohol for this assembly.
Well, good luck finding
a song that does that.
RACHEL:
Mr. Shue?
First of all,
that vest is very cute.
You are all kinds of awesome.
But second, maybe
there's really no songs
about the dangers of drinking
because there's really none
as long as you have
a proper designated driver.
I ever told you
how great you are?
Whoa.
WILL:
Well, Rachel, yeah.
Driving drunk
is dangerous.
And have you guys ever heard
of alcohol poisoning?
Yeah, it kills about 400 people
every year. Uh...
Santana, are you...
are you crying?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
QUINN:
You're such
a hypocrite.
You drink. Most adults do.
Well, I may have a beer
every now and then,
but I don't...
I don't get drunk.
We're just saying
this is a waste of time.
I mean, we're totally
aware of alcohol.
We see adults
drinking it and having fun.
Every commercial
during NASCAR
is for beer.
Okay. Enough, guys.
Look, tomorrow come
with your thinking caps on,
because we're going
to spend the entire day
brainstorming ideas for songs
to sing at
this assembly.
Am I out of touch?
I mean, I used to drink
a lot more when I was their age.
Most of the time it was just
to deal with Terri, but I mean,
who am I to tell them
not to drink
when I blacked out
a couple of times
when I was their age,
and I ended up okay?
You're taking
this way too hard.
Something else
going on?
Let's see.
Um... my divorce is starting
to really sink in.
Sue's coaching my competition
at Regionals.
And Emma is looking for a house
with her husband.
Is that all?
What do you do
for stress
relief?
Exercise.
Well, me, too, but that's
a little too close to
being productive.
You got to get a little
ridiculous, man, burn off
some of that angst.
You have
any suggestions?
Tomorrow night,
you're tagging along with me
for my stress relief.
We're going to
a little place
they call Rosalita's Roadhouse.
Isn't that like
a honky-tonk bar?
You ain't lived till you've
seen me in a...  cowboy hat!
So far away
Doesn't anybody stay
in one place anymore?
I didn't drink that much.
Are you kidding?
You spent the entire night
sucking Rachel Berry's face.
That, sir, is what
we call rock bottom.
Oh, my God.
Speak of the devil.
Two medium drips.
Hi, Rachel.
Kurt and I were just
talking about you.
You're such a cutie pie
with your blazer and your pants.
So...
I have a question for you.
I wanted to know...
Oh, my God.
Is she drunk?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.
All right, I'll
see you then.
Okay, bye.
Rachel just asked me out.
Oh, that's amazing.
She's got a girl crush on you.
Wait a second.
Why'd you say yes?
You can't lead her on.
Who says I'm
leading her on?
You can't be serious.
When we kissed,
it... it felt good.
It felt good
because you were drunk.
What's the harm in going out
on one crummy little date?
You're gay, Blaine!
I... thought I was, but...
I've never even had
a boyfriend before.
Isn't this the time you're
supposed to... figure stuff out?
I can't believe that I'm
hearing this right now.
Maybe I'm bi. I don't know.
Bisexual's a term that
gay guys in high school use
when they want to hold hands
with girls and feel like
a normal person
for a change.
Whoa, wait, wait.
Why are you so angry?
Because I look up to you.
I admire how proud you are
of who you are.
I know what it's like
to be in the closet,
and here you are
about to tiptoe back in.
I'm really sorry if this
hurts your feelings
or your pride or whatever,
but however confusing
it might be for you,
it's actually a lot more
confusing for me.
You're 100% sure
who you are.
Fantastic.
Well... maybe we all
can't be so lucky.
Yeah, I have... I've had
a lot of luck, Blaine.
I was really lucky to be
chased out of high school
by a bully who
threatened to kill me.
And why did he do that?
Because he didn't
like who I was.
Sort of exactly what you're
saying to me right now.
Isn't it?
I am...
...I'm searching, okay?
I am honestly just
trying to figure out
who I am, and for you,
of all people, to get
down on me for that,
I didn't think
that's who you were.
I'll see you.
I'd say "bye," but I wouldn't
want to make you angry.
Last night I
Went to town
Hit every bar around
A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall
I thought I could
drink 'em all...
Whoo!
I wanna welcome everybody
to Rosalita's Roadhouse,
where the men are men
and the sheep are nervous.
A, uh, special warm welcome
to Will Schuester,
joining us here
for the first time tonight.
My friend
Shannon the Cannon here
tells me Will wants to hop up
on stage and sing us a song.
Come on up here, cowboy.
Whoo!
I hate you for this.
You know, you know,
I-I am not singing anything
without my gal here.
Come on, bring her a microphone,
bring her a microphone.
I want to tell you a story
About the house rent blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady
I done lost my job
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:
Aw...
Mm, mm
She said, "That
don't comfort me
Long as I get my money
next Friday"
Now, next Friday come,
I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went
One bourbon
One scotch
And one beer
Well, I ain't seen my baby
Since I don't know when
I've been drinking bourbon
Whiskey, scotch and gin
Gonna get high, man
I'm gonna get loose
Need me a triple shot
Of that juice
Gonna get drunk
Don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon,
one scotch
And one beer
One bourbon
One scotch
And one beer
Ha!
I ain't seen my baby
Since the night before last
Gonna get a drink, man
I'm gonna get gassed
Got to get high, man
I ain't had enough
Need me a triple
Shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk
Won't you listen right here?
I want one bourbon
One shot and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch
And one beer
I want all that!
One bourbon, one scotch
And one beer.
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
Drinks on me!
Thanks for helping
with the party cleanup.
Especially
considering
that you didn't even drink.
Well, I was in
the neighborhood.
At 10:00?
Are you sure you're not here
just to find out how
my date with Blaine went?
Oh, was that tonight?
Look, we're
friends, so...
I'm gonna be
honest with you.
The date was lovely.
We saw Love Story at
the Revival Theater.
We even dressed up
as the characters.
That's not gay at all.
Did you kiss?
No. Our lips
spent the evening mouthing
Ali McGraw's dialogue.
Frankly, I did expect
a little snog
as the date drew
to a close, but...
I guess the timing
just wasn't right.
Or the blood-alcohol level.
Look... I know that
you have feelings for him,
and I'm sure you think
I'm crazy for asking him out,
but Blaine is
obviously conflicted,
and if he
turns out not
to be gay, well, then I guess I
will have done you a favor.
And I'm doing you a favor
by telling you that Blaine
is the first of a long line
of conflicted men that
you will date
that will later
turn out to be only
thmost flaming of homosexuals.
Blaine and I have
a lot in common.
A sentiment expressed
by many a hag about many a gay.
Look, I don't doubt
that you and Blaine
would have a jolly good time
shopping at Burberry
and arguing
who would make
the better Rum Tum Tugger--
I don't dispute that--
but there's something you
and Blaine'll never have...
and that's chemistry.
Fine.
Then I'm gonna
prove you wrong.
I'm gonna take
the beer goggles off, and
I'm gonna kiss him sober.
And if the spark is still
there, then I'm taking you
to your bakery of choice for a
piping hot slice of humble pie.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
easy, partner.
: Can I get
you something to drink?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Taxi's waiting.
All right.
H-H-How are you not drunk?
We drank exactly
the same amount.
I got a hollow leg.
You got a hollow leg!
You gonna be okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?
I just... just
got to grade some papers
and... I'm still looking
for a song for the kids to sing
at the Alcohol
Awareness Assembly.
Oh...
Yes, uh...
The kids
want to sing a Ke$ha song...
but, uh, it just makes drinking
seem like a lot of fun.
Exactly.
Like tonight.
That's the most fun I've had
in a really long time.
I mean, we were careful.
Mm-hmm.
We didn't drive.
Mm, yeah.
What's wrong with that?
Nothin'.
Nothin's wrong with that.
Except we're not
teenagers anymore, Will.
You know?
The way I see it,
you can't just
lecture kids.
I mean, we can't stop
them from drinking
if that's what
they're gonna do.
I mean, the best
we can do
is make them aware of
the dangers and just...
hope they're
smart enough
to make a good
decision on their own.
Nut. All right, buddy,
I'm out of here.
Okay.
Don't get up.
I'm not...
All right, hey.
Yes?
You just make sure you
drink lots of water.
Okay?
Mwa!
I love you.
Right back at you.
Yay, happy face.
Okay.
That was a valiant effort.
You get a A-plus.
That's how I roll.
I don't even know who you are.
Oh, what the hell?
Hey, there...
sexy lady.
I know it's late.
And... I know you're taken,
and I've had
a couple drinks, but...
...there's something I r-really,
really want to say to you.
William!
Can't wait to see what your
New Directions are planning
for the assembly.
I know we've had issues
with your kids performing
in front of the school,
but I have a really good feeling
about this one.
:
Why are you screaming?
I'm not screaming.
Are you okay?
Oh... wow, your cologne
is just really strong.
It's Drakar Noir!
Emma.
Ooh...
Will, you look terrible.
Considering how
much I drank,
I think I'm lucky
to be alive.
Although I kind of
wish I was dead.
I am so embarrassed.
Why? I mean, besides
the fact that you drank
like a frat boy
and you're well
into your 30's.
Please don't
make me say it.
Sorry?
I don't even remember
half the things I said to you.
I-I'm not following.
I-I drunk-dialed you last night.
No, you didn't.
I mean, I didn't get
a single message.
What would you have said that
you'd be embarrassed about?
Nothing.
I-I-I... This
must have been
a really elaborate, uh,
booze dream, yeah.
SUE:
It's time, Will.
I've arranged to have you
committed for 48 hours,
and it's not
gonna be easy.
Those state institutions
tend to turn the fire hose
on patients going
through the D.T.'s,
but at this point,
I have no other option
but a forced intervention.
Sue, I do not have
a drinking problem.
Really? Then what's with
the Corey Hart imitation?
Will, I'm trying to save you.
Why? All you ever want
to do is destroy me.
Yeah, well, it's kind of like
nursing a P.O.W. back to health
so he's at his strongest
when you torture him to death.
All right, Will,
you had your chance
to do this the easy way.
KURT: Souffle is all
about the whites.
If you get yolk in it
or you don't let it
stiffen properly
then you might as well
be making pancakes.
All right. You think the one
we already made is ready yet?
I hope so.
All right, let's check it out.
Here we go.
Ta-da.
You didn't leave
enough room in the
dish to let it rise.
Hey, I'm sorry-- why are
you being so hard on me?
I would've been happy
with you teaching me
to make toast.
I'm sorry, Dad, I know
this is supposed to be
bonding time, but...
it's Blaine.
He's interested...
in Rachel.
I'm confused;
I thought he was gay, too.
Oh, he is, he is.
He's just...
experimenting.
Yeah. He's not the only one.
What does that mean?
Look, I need you to ask me
before you have
someone sleep over.
We-we were fullylothed
the entire time,
and Blaine was too drunk to
drive, so I let him crash here.
I was being responsible.
Wait a minute,
you kids are drinking now?
Finn and I didn't have any.
If that's what
you're worried about.
No. I'm worried
about you being
inappropriate
in my house.
And if Puckerman had
a sleepover with Finn,
would that be inappropriate?
That's different.
Because they
wouldn't have sex?
No, I would never allow Finn
to have a girl sleep over
in his bed.
But would it make you
uncomfortable if he did?
Hey, when have
I been uncomfortable
with you being gay?
So it's not being gay
that upsets you,
it's just me acting on it.
I don't know what two guys do
when they're together.
You know, I sat through
that whole Brokeback Mountain.
From what I gather,
something went down
in the tent.
Okay. What do you want
from me here, Dad? I...
I want you to apologize
for being inappropriate
and promise me
you'll never do it again.
Fine. I'm sorry.
I won't have sleepovers with
anyone that might be gay
without asking you first.
Thank you.
But maybe you could step
outside your comfort zone
and educate yourself, so
if I have any questions,
I could go to my dad, like
any straight son could.
. Quiet,
please, children.
I would like
to wish you and yours
a healthy and happy
Alcohol Awareness Week.
Unfortunately,
Kitty Dukakis could not be here
because of disinterest,
but Lima Police Chief
Lawrence Krowley is here
to show you a grisly slideshow
of auto accidents.
Take it away, Chief.
BRITTANY: You guys, I'm
really nervous.
Ke$ha's been
a cultural icon for weeks,
and I really want
to do her music justice.
We haven't had enough rehearsal.
Or any at all.
And most of our
assembly performances
usually end
in some kind of riot.
Never fear, teammates.
Now, it's a Broadway tradition
for nervous performers
to take a shot of whiskey
before going on
to calm their nerves
and to mask the stench
of bad dental hygiene.
In that tradition, I have mixed
us a playful showbiz cocktail
of what was left in
my dads' liquor cabinet.
There's some brandy
and vermouth and port wine
and scotch in here, and also
a little bit of Kool-Aid
and some crumbled-up Oreos.
SANTANA:
Oh, my God.
This tastes like
cough syrup.
There's also cough syrup.
ALL: Cheers.
To Ke$ha.
Cheers. Ke$ha.
To Ke$ha.
To Ke$ha.
Thank you, Chief.
And now,
performing the hit single,
"Tik and also Tok"
by rapper Ke-dollar-sign-ha,
the New Directions.
Wake up in the morning
feeling like P. Diddy
Hey, what up, girl?
Grab my glasses
I'm out the door,
I'm gonna hit this city
Let's go
Before I leave
Brush my teeth
with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the
night, I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure
on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes,
clothes
Boys blowing up our phones,
phones
Drop-topping,
playing our favorite CDs
Going up to the parties
Trying to get
a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
till we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
till we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock,
but the party don't stop, no
I don't feel good.
Power through it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you've got me
With my hands up
You've got me now
You've got that sound
Yeah, you've got me
You build me up,
you break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you've got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now, the party
Don't start till I walk in
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
till we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, my God.
Everybody, drink responsibly.
Heads up, McKinley.
Coach Sylvester's
gonna shout at ya.
Students,
colleagues, indeed,
all who understand
the Queen's English...
we all still quake in terror
at what we witnessed yesterday
at the assembly by a Glee Club
spiraling out of control.
My nose is still filled
with the acrid stench
of teen vomit.
And there is, simply,
but one person to blame.
The alcoholic teen-vomit
fetishist Will Schuester,
the director of that club.
Two days ago,
I received a drunk dial
in the middle of the night
from a horny Will Schuester.
Oh, no.
Open your ears, McKinley High,
and behold the awful price
of alcoholism.
WILL :
Hey there, sexy lady.
There's something I really,
really want to say to you.
I love how you eat your lunch
with your little plastic gloves,
and they crinkle
and make the cutest sound I've
ever heard in my life.
Why don't you pick up
some wine coolers,
and come over here?
And it'll be just one night
of us just getting crazy.
Let's just get crazy!
Let's get really crazy
and roll around in the hay.
I was just in some hay
earlier tonight,
and I rode a bull
and I was thinking of you.
Will Schuester?
You've just been
publicly humiliated.
And on the road to recovery,
it's the very first step.
I think you'll
definitely get suspended.
You'll probably all
get suspended.
Oh, you're one to talk. How
about you crack a Four Loko,
Count Boozy Von Drunk-a-ton.
William? Glee Club?
I have one word for you.
Congratulations.
Those special effects at
the assembly really paid off!
I had no idea what brilliant
musical comedy performers
you all have become.
The kids at this school
are scared straight.
Today is the first day
in a month without a single act
of public drunkenness
at McKinley High!
And as a thank
you, here are
coupons
for half-off frozen yogurt.
Yum.
William, I do think
you need to see someone
about your sex
and love addiction.
I've talked
to my pastor about you,
and he's willing to meet you
at your earliest convenience.
Thank you.
Okay.
Achievement!
I'm torn. Part of me never wants
to drink again because it made
me so sick, but if it weren't
for drinking, the assembly would
have been a disaster.
I, for one, am never
drinking again.
Being thrown up on, it just
does something to a person.
All right, guys, while I'm happy
things worked out
with the assembly,
I never want to see you guys
pull anything like that again.
Drinking while performing
is unprofessional.
Drinking while at school
is just stupid,
and, most importantly,
any of you guys
drinking at all is illegal.
There's a fair
amount of the pot
calling the kettle
black right now.
:
That is so racist.
WILL:
I couldn't agree more.
Which is why I'm going
to stop drinking.
Not even a beer at the end of
the night to take the edge off.
But if you don't drink,
what will you have
to live for?
I have plenty
in my life without beer.
Like what, exactly?
The point is, I'm going to stop.
And I hope you guys do, too.
Isn't that kind
of unrealistic?
Yeah. Honestly,
I think it is.
Which is why I'm only
going to ask you to do it
until after Nationals.
Consider yourselves
like prize fighters
getting ready for a
big heavyweight bout.
Now, these are
pledge forms.
And I want you guys
to sign them.
And what if we fall
off the wagon again?
Look in the top corner
of your form.
That's my cell phone number.
Yes!
Part of your pledge
is that if you do slip up,
no matter where you are,
or what time of the night it is,
I want you to call me
to drive you home.
We got lucky this time
that the only consequences
of your drinking
was some ill-timed vomiting.
None of us wants to see any
of you guys get hurt.
Cool beans, Mr. Shue.
I'll sign this.
Me, too. I mean,
alcohol has done nothing
for my songwriting.
What about
after we win Nationals?
I'm buying the sparkling cider.
SAM:
Yes.
So, you said he comes
this way at 3:30?
Like clockwork. For his
post-rehearsal medium drip.
I just can't wait
to lay one on him.
I've got a bad feeling
about this, Rachel.
I mean, I don't mean
to be schooled,
but I don't want you
to get hurt, either.
There's no victory in this
for me, either way.
Who cares about you, buddy?
I might get a new
boyfriend out of this,
who can keep up with me
vocally, and in the future,
give me vaguely Eurasian-
looking children.
KURT:
There he is.
Dreamy as ever.
Okay. Wish me luck.
I feel the earth move
under my feet
Hey, Rachel.
What's going on?
I feel the sky tumbling down
A'tumbling down
I feel the earth move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
A'tumbling down,
I just lose control
Huh.
Yep.
I'm gay.
Thank you so much for clearing
that up for me, Rachel.
Listen, save my space
in line, will you?
I got to go hit
the restroom.
All over
I feel the earth move
under my feet
I feel the sky...
That was hard,
wasn't it?
Are you kidding?
That was amazing.
I am speechless.
I just had
a relationship with a guy
who turned out to be gay.
That is songwriting gold.
Oh!
Okay. I have
to go compose.
But thank you. Thank you.
