India. This nation has such
a firm bond with its' people...
That Indians carry their
soil with them everywhere.
But their heart lives in India.
Take for example, London...
A wealthy business family.
After 5 generations in London...
But their eldest son's
heart and body...
...resides in a corner of
London called a mini India.
He is the eldest son
called Hari Mayur.
According to him, his father's
philosophy of earning more money...
...is sinful but spending money
on Indians in difficulty is good.
When the father started going
crazy getting son cured abroad...
He decided on the Indian cure.
The crazy son to be bound
by the chords of marriage!
To escape punishment, Hari banged
his head at his grandma's feet.
But how could she hear?
Bismillah Khan's music
echoed in her ears.
And she tied the groom's turban
on her darling grandson's head.
He has escaped to India.
The man who gave his heart to India...
Even sacrificed his life for it.
But who can harm the one
the Lord Himself protects.
Near the coast of Bombay,
Hari was found unconscious by a kid.
Sister, this man is not dead!
She looked after him so well...
That he regained consciousness soon.
On opening his eyes,
his ears heard this news.
The fish in the sea
ate up his corpse.
As a result the search
was being called off.
And his death is being
announced in the papers.
On hearing of his death,
Hari decided...
...Not to inform his
family of his being alive.
Or he'd be hanged by the
marriage garland again.
So he made his death his life.
And decided to live
in his dear India
Stranger...
And Atariya, who had worked day
and night to give him a new life...
He decided to spend the
rest of his life with her.
Can't your launch go any faster?
Drive fast. Nandlal is coming home.
- Who is he?
- Drive fast!
What's the problem today?
Don't call him a problem!
Nandlal is coming home today!
- Where are you running off?
- Nandlal is coming home!
- Sister!
- My Birju has come!
- Where is he?
- Who?
My Nandlal.
Silly girl! He is here.
He'll come after a month.
A whole month!
Then why did you call me
back early from school?
Have you forgotten?
Today is the Diwali fair.
In your joy for Nandlal,
you forgot to kiss me today.
Sister!
He's saying something to me.
Really? You talk to him.
My exams will start in a month.
It will be very difficult.
Why don't you arrive early?
That's enough. Go and wash up.
I'll serve dinner.
- Have you discussed with
your husband? - What?
- Nandlal is mine.
- Why don't you tell him?
- Where is he?
- He doesn't live in our world.
He's always in his own world.
Must be somewhere there.
Save my baby!
I'm coming!
She was pregnant!
Gently.
I've already told you.
If you don't get her treated now
her life will be in danger.
I said, no!
No! Don't touch! Go away!
He's mad!
I'm coming to you.
I'm going.
I don't want to leave you.
I'm very frightened.
- I don't want to go.
- I won't let you even if you want to.
I didn't swear to always
be with you for nothing.
Don't cry.
Did I ever tell you I don't
like your nose, eyes, ears?
Your smile captivated me.
And if you always want
me to be with you...
Then always keep smiling.
Smile.
That's it. Now I won't
let you ever go away.
He's my Nandlal. Give him to me.
I swear I had asked sister
for him even before he was born.
And she had agreed.
He is mine. Give him to me.
I told you not to bother us.
Troubling the hospital for 3 days!
But he's mine!
She's not letting me see him!
Who is the child's
closest relative?
Forget about relations,
he knew nobody at all!
The child's mother has one
innocent little sister.
- And this man...
- I was living off her.
I can't eke out a living for myself.
How will I bring up a child?
What will happen to the child?
We must admit him to an orphanage.
Come with me. I'll have him
admitted to a good orphanage.
No!
Give the line to Sevakram.
Catch her! She's running
away with the child!
- Stop! What are you doing?
- I won't let you take him away!
Catch the girl!
- Where are you taking him?
- I'll bring him up.
Be careful! The baby!
I'll die but not give him up!
Do you want to die?
What if you'd come under the car?
People give birth to kids
but can't look after them!
Let's go there and see.
We've looked everywhere
but there's no sign of her.
Lord! Only you can help.
Take the baby in your refuge.
She's the youngest
mother in the world.
The Lord is truly strange.
All of us are indebted
to that person.
Weren't you given lots of money?
We must hold that man's
child close to our hearts.
Can't we look after him?
She is not here.
- Where is she?
- Where is Kalva?
Get up and sit. Where are
Bijuriya and the baby?
- Must be in.
- They are not in!
Not in? Then why are you asking me
where she is? Go and look for her!
Maybe she's in trouble.
Milk has come. Drink it.
First you wet yourself. Then you cry.
I'm almost done.
See, I made you a new diaper!
You're almost clean.
There, almost done.
Give me a kiss.
You're 16? Wrong!
Never forget your position!
I have 1707 ships across the seas
obeying my orders
But do I ever forget my position?
I was always the porter
who worked for 7 annas a day.
And so I'll always remain.
So never forget your position.
Quote a price for your position.
First look after your own price!
The porter, finished!
Count your money later
First pay me my dues.
Go back. Your latest fan, Bheem
Khalasi must be waiting for you.
- That dog?
- He's a jewel.
He can turn you to gold with a touch.
Send your mother and sister to him.
Double earnings! Give my money!
No!
Nandu has to go for a
picnic tomorrow. Give it.
Took the rascal's name.
I know everything.
He's the reason you're
not marrying me.
If you talk like this about
my Nandu, I'll spit and walk out.
Out of your beer bar
and your life!
Where are you going?
I'll pay you off.
First give me a kiss.
The Lord gave you a kick!
That's what happens.
Not the Lord, somebody below.
- I'll sort him out!
- Give this here.
Escaped!
Dog!
I forgot to light your lamp.
My Bijuriya is in danger.
She has to dance because of me.
Yes, listen to this.
I had a beautiful dream last night.
Know what? I saw Bijuriya dressed
as a bride in a shimmering saree.
I won't lie to you.
People say you make all the matches.
If the one you've chosen
for her would be found...
The devotee hadn't even finished
saying what was in his mind.
That the Lord started
showing his glory.
Hari's younger brother, Vikram
did such wonders in business...
That he was honoured by the
Europe Business Association.
His name was being
discussed everywhere.
We'll interview him but
first we congratulate him.
He's the first Indian...
I'm British.
I'm not Indian.
When your parents
came here from India...
- He didn't come.
- Then?
He ran away to save his life.
What danger did he face?
Of unemployment and hunger which
is the trademark of India.
But England looked
after us so well...
...that even today
we are appreciated.
And counted among one of
the biggest business houses.
Then why did your elder brother
Hari discard it all and go to India?
He wanted to go to India.
He had to pay for it with his life.
The plane crashed
before it reached India.
In any case, a Mayur and
India can never be united.
India and Mayur will now unite.
Found the picture of Hari's family!
Let's go and quickly tell Bijuriya.
That her Nandu is heir
to a millionaire family!
They think his plane
crashed into the sea.
And fish ate his corpse.
Hari used to eat fish day and night.
- So? - So why didn't he inform
his family of his being alive?
Sit down and think.
That is right.
Maybe there's some family enmity...
Or worse secrets.
That is why we can't
tell her anything.
I'll meet him and find out...
What is Vikram Mayur?
He is wealthy and what are we?
How will we meet him?
Watch the drama.
How I get the sky down to earth!
In the High Commission of London...
I'll frame such a case of
cheating and deception...
That he'll come dancing!
No greetings from India?
It's old age.
Don't do that son. He's come
to our house. Meet him.
He must have come t bother me
about the request to honour me.
Not to honour you but to
give you the court summons.
A case has been filed on
Mayur and Mayur from India.
- Excuse us for...
- I don't excuse.
Why don't you tell me what this is?
What this is? This is your India.
The company that is being
garlanded by the world...
Your India has congratulated
that same Mayur and Mayur.
And the name quoted is
of my departed elder brother.
Our Hari?
Yes, and the case is that Hari...
...trapped a man and
started a business.
And on purpose he pushed
the firm to bankruptcy.
But Hari's plane crashed
before reaching India.
I'll go to India.
This is a matter of our prestige
and my departed brother's soul.
I'll go to India myself.
Look there!
Remove your hands!
Who is come? Come on.
Hurry up or this man will
turn the case upside down.
He's probably done so already!
Have a betel leaf.
This is Mahowa betel leaf!
If you come to India and not
have this, you don't know India.
I don't even want to know India!
The only one I want to meet
is the rascal Madadgar!
Your slave is called Madadgar.
That brother Hari didn't
die in the accident...
He lived here for years and
didn't tell anyone who he is.
Nor did he inform us
that he's alive.
He ran away from wedding there
and got married on coming here.
That too with an Indian woman!
He fell in love with an Indian
girl so the marriage was lucky.
He sired such a beautiful son
that the moon would feel shy.
Brother Hari has a son?
Yes and he's 8 years old.
And his aunt looks after him
with all her heart and soul.
If you wish to see him, I'll try
to take permission from the aunt.
What do you mean, wish to see?
My grandmother's life is just
automation after his death.
That child will bring back
her smile.
If brother Hari had a son,
he is Master Mayur.
- He is ours.
- Of course the boy is yours.
But he is looked after by the aunt.
So we have to ask her.
- What does she do?
- His aunt...
I asked what she does.
- What she does?
- Yes.
Every day and night of her life...
...is sacrificed in bringing up
the torch of your family name.
From where did you give
birth to a stupid uncle?
- He's a cheat!
- He can't be a cheat.
Look carefully. The two brothers
are years apart from each other.
But they are similar. Have a look.
Which monkey are you matching
with my princely brother-in-law?
He looks like a cheat,
a thorough gangster!
I must complain against him
and have him locked up.
- I'm off to the police...
- Take a breath child. Sit.
He is your poor Nandu's
millionaire uncle.
Your innocent Nandu belongs
to such a wealthy family.
Listen to me and let
him see him just once.
What will one meeting do?
He's like the angel of death!
Till I send him back,
I'll keep meeting him.
When do I arrange the meeting?
I'm in a hurry.
My heart is beating so fast.
Driving me mad!
I hope you haven't told him...
I scream my guts out
and dance in a beer bar!
No, dear. I've built up your image
so well that he's coming to see you.
Will you show that pain
the way to my house too?
You called this pain from abroad.
So you take him to your house!
At 5 o'clock sharp.
Are you ready?
Do you look like a
full, complete, queen?
What can I say?
You look like a prostitute!
Wear your driver's dress.
He's scared me even more.
This poor aunt of yours is
raising the heir to our family.
Has she given you any idea of her
services? How much will she charge?
No way sir.
I hope this is her.
Her royal majesty arrives.
Who is this queen?
- She's the aunt.
- I see.
Bless me uncle.
Have you come to meet him
or enact a drama at my house?
I've come to blacken the face
of the trouble facing my baby!
Move out of my way.
Where is that scoundrel?
Good God!
Greetings.
I apologize because you
had to wait long for me.
If you say, I'll fall at your feet.
I should be apologising.
But why?
I thought you'd be a poor, old...
I am poor.
But not so poor that I would
raise my eyes at my baby's rights.
I understand you.
You've come as his uncle
to claim his inheritance.
I'll pay a good sum by my price.
- I don't understand.
- Then try to follow.
I want the decision to be taken now.
Don't look towards my child!
If you wish, along with cash you
may take all these and make me nude...
No, no nudity! Please.
Yes, I am here.
What's going on?
- I don't understand.
- Neither will you.
It's our good fortune that
the heir to the Mayur family...
...is being raised by a
great woman like you.
Thanks. So our decision is made.
- I'll take leave.
- But why...?
We've just started talking.
What's the hurry?
Everybody will be waiting
for me at the palace.
The sun is about to set.
I pray at this time.
- Isn't it uncle?
- Yes, 7 o'clock daily.
When should I come to meet the kid?
- In your palace?
- Why will you meet the kid?
We've decided. The boy
will come to meet you.
- When?
- Let him study and grow up.
What was the enmity between his
father and the Mayur family...
That he threw away a rich inheritance?
I'll explain everything.
Don't bother. I won't
understand anything.
The nephew will come and
understand from the uncle.
I've done my duty by coming here.
Your highness, it's time for
your prayers in the palace.
I think you should leave soon.
If you've felt offended at
anything I said, I beg you...
This garment is my foe.
Forgive me, sir.
You've been insulted in my house...
Neither you nor I have
been insulted.
Her highness had no garment in this.
I mean no mistake.
Hari had us do his death rituals.
And got married here.
Have mercy on that little one.
Master Mayur is with her.
We're grateful for that.
But she has a lot of wrong
notions about us in her mind.
I should meet and clear these.
Please take me to meet her.
Now.
What did you say?
What are you saying?
- Give me one.
- Here you are.
Where's it?
- I just gave it to you.
- This is just a paper.
- But I passed it...
- Then where is it?
It's on my shoe!
I'm watching you for long!
Falling all over me!
Do you have any mother or sister?
Mind your basket.
Can you tell me the way to
Her Highness Devirani's palace?
The queen of Jhansi?
We have only one queen.
Are you talking about her?
When she walks...
It feels as if Lord
Rama shot an arrow.
Yes, her walk is special.
And her eyes...
One glance and
you're finished for life!
You are talking of her.
Where can I find her?
She doesn't meet us
just gives appearances.
She exhibits her dance
at Banjo's den.
What are you doing?
Doesn't look where he's
walking and then acts smart!
- Are you blind or me?
- Arguing! I'll show him!
Calling me queen!
Hey! See what he's doing!
Come here again and I'll slit you!
Cover yourself with this scarf.
I've told you so many times!
Everybody will stand to watch.
Such a small place.
Such a big queen.
Yet nobody knows of her.
It's almost evening.
You're still wandering?
Looks like some fruit cake
made a fruitcake out of you!
The 6 o'clock boat has gone.
- I let it off.
- It's 5 o'clock.
How did you let a 6 o'clock
launch leave at 5 o'clock?
It was full. Should I have
held on to it? Am I a fool?
I mean what time is the next launch?
At 4:30
It's 5 now. When will it be 4.30?
- Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
- What will I do till then?
- I don't know. I'll go to sleep.
What Willis do now?
Grandma will call up.
Not finding me there, she'll worry.
No cigarettes too.
Who is it?
Sir, do you want to call abroad?
Yes. Is there a place?
You need a place to sleep in.
I'll take you there.
Are you a big government officer?
- I'm just...
- This way.
Then what's your business?
- A small business.
- Must be doing well.
Yes, I manage.
Do you live in London?
Just a minute, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- He's my God.
He was on our way. How could
I leave without a prayer?
Why don't you pay obeisance?
May I ask you something
if you won't feel offended?
Are you married?
You're making so many
inquiries about me.
Any girl in mind?
Talking makes time pass easily.
We're already at the hotel.
You're a good kid.
Do you want your brand of cigarette?
- How do you know?
- I polish shoes.
Was that you? Under my feet?
Don't you study, go to school?
I get dressed to go to school
but I don't attend it.
- Why?
- I have to collect lots of money.
I'm in great trouble.
How much money do you need
to get over this trouble?
I don't want money from you.
You asked me out of love
and I answered with love.
Don't you want the cigarette?
I do want it.
I'll just be back!
He's very generous.
I've given him two packets.
He hasn't got married as yet.
You know what's in my mind.
But I don't know what's in your mind.
What is it?
Do you get any beer here?
You don't get beer here!
Decent people live here!
Go to Bombay if you want beer.
I feel I've seen this
cartoon somewhere.
But where have I seen him...?
I just asked for a beer bar
and he... Mister Horse...
- Where's Bijuriya?
- Doing her show.
How can she perform!
She's dead!
What's the meaning of this torn note?
He said if madam wants the
other half, she must go to room
Got it! He didn't understand
when I explained as a rich woman.
When I explain as a half note
woman, then he'll understand!
You called me a prostitute?
But if you abuse me Nandu calling
him Master Mayur, it will be bad!
The brother whose picture is on
the wall and you burn incense...
Has that brother's 8 year
old son landed from the sky?
Now he wants his Master Mayur!
Will I shut up because you say so?
Even if my Nandu is related to
you have you brought any proof?
Or just these rags of paper?
Where is your purse?
Show me.
Don't touch me!
Don't be under any wrong ideas.
As it is this half note has shrunk
your image to half in my eyes.
And I'm full, completely honourable.
Honourable.
In the world's dirtiest
room in the dirtiest hotel...
- You come for half a note...
- This is just a hotel.
I'll get into the flames of hell.
That too barefoot!
And if worse times come...
I'll sacrifice my honour
for half a note!
On this very bed!
What wrong notions are
you in? If I was that...
What you think I am...
Wherever you'd be in the world...
Any moment I wanted...
I'd have you on this bed!
But I want my Master Mayur not you
Do you understand?
Your call to London.
It's me grandma. How are you?
I've never stayed without you.
I'm quite worried.
What are you stuck for?
I'm getting a priceless gift for you.
I won't tell you. I'll show it.
When you see it, you'll leave
your wheel chair and start dancing.
- Give me a hint.
- Bless me grandma.
He's getting a bride!
No, you can't go to school with me!
All the boys will tease me.
I've grown up.
You don't know.
There's trouble brewing!
Once we clear this problem
you may travel on your own.
But now till I come, don't
step out of school. Got it?
It hurts.
He had to come now. You go
and see. Must be the egg seller.
Tell him one egg turned rotten
last time. First take that.
Yesterday's egg was rotten.
Give me a replacement.
Who gave you my address?
You're funny. If the stuff
was bad, I'll replace it.
I'll return your money.
But don't come home!
Why are you standing here? Go.
Go away.
I'm talking to you!
How can I open my mouth before you?
She embarrassed me so much
by masquerading as a queen that...
I feel like digging a grave for
myself and lying down in it!
No need for you to bother.
Your... she...
Your actress asked me for proof
of master Mayur being my nephew.
Now you'll get me brother Hari's
certified marriage certificates.
And Mayur's birth certificate
is not given to me...
Then I'll dig your grave myself.
And I'll bury you too.
You've just asked for these.
I'll get a mountain if you wish.
I always greeted you as if you
were the lamp of her dark hut.
And you burnt my house!
- Think with a cool mind...
- What? There's no heart left!
The cheating of law!
You sold every decency
to that foreigner!
I had heard now I've seen it!
There's an antidote for snake
bite but not a lawyer's sting!
You are wrong child.
I did my duty as an uncle.
I only asked the Mayur family...
I've only asked for his legal right.
To hell with your family rights!
Here we're in difficulties
and you're worried about rights!
This is a court order. You can't
stop Nandu from meeting his uncle.
And if you stop us,
we'll have to arrest you.
Yes, take me!
Where are the hand cuffs?
What are you doing?
Don't you trust me?
Listen. My hands and feet maybe cut.
They may chop off my head.
But can they separate me from you?
That's the police.
Don't say anything.
You know nothing. There's
a great conspiracy behind this.
I'll handle it, you keep
quiet. Swear by me.
If you speak now,
you'll see me dead!
I won't speak.
I'm not scared. Let me too see from
where my uncle has landed suddenly.
You spoke again?
I made you promise.
I'm just advising you. If that
foreigner shakes your hand...
Fold your hands and say
this is our culture. Got it?
Don't touch any food he offers you.
- Say you're fasting.
- Okay.
- Not even water.
- Okay.
What a scene she's creating.
It's not a scene.
It's that Lord's miracle.
The work will be done soon.
- Do one thing for me.
- Yes, grandma?
Convey my love to your blessing.
There's no blessing here.
Here's what you wanted.
Run!
If I knew you were my uncle,
I wouldn't sell you cigarettes.
Don't worry about anything now.
I have little time and
lots to talk to you about.
So I'll talk and you eat.
First promise not to tell Bijuriya
about my polish or cigarettes.
- Actually that girl...
- Her name is Bijuriya.
My baby's come!
Why are you so late?
Didn't the rascal let you go?
His name is not rascal
but Mister Vikram Mayur.
And he's my real uncle!
Real uncle! Didn't even
give you one toffee!
What's all this?
How do I know? I haven't seen it.
- He packed it along.
- Given for you!
- Put it in my carriage.
- Come.
It's all ours!
My sweet is up? Wash up
I'll rustle up breakfast.
How can I get up?
Give me my gown.
Who used my soap?
My hands were dirty so I...
You're so big yet you don't know...
You shouldn't use anybody's
comb, towel or soap!
Sorry. Don't spoil your
mood. I'll wash it for you.
That's the limit!
Is a soap ever washed?
Soap washes things. You keep
this. I'll bathe in the hotel.
What will uncle think
of you if he hears?
Didn't recognise me?
I'm your Nandu!
Even I didn't know I'm master Mayur.
I've got so much wealth that
I can make you into gold.
But I hope you remember my request.
I have an appointment
with uncle for dinner.
Not that way. You don't play
the band with a fork and knife.
I'll show you.
Uncle said, you must
pick up food as if...
The spoon touches the plate
and makes gentle music.
You can never learn to eat!
You eat the normal way!
I've got this cassette specially
for you all the way from London.
What's special about it?
You will see it and
tell me what it is!
This is the palace of
the queen of England.
This is Mayur Mansion.
Not of the queen.
This is your house.
This is your bedroom.
You'll sleep here.
This is your dining room.
Your study.
- How did you like it?
- It didn't appear real.
It all felt like a dream.
If you come with me,
all your dreams will come true.
But how can I come with you?
Why can't you come with me?
I told you I had a problem.
I remember but you never
told me what that problem is.
Don't worry. I'm your uncle.
I have to get Bijuriya married.
- What do you have to do?
- Get her married.
You've been selling whisky
and cigarettes for this?
And polishing shoes on roads...
The money is good in Bombay
Plus I get to see boys.
And while working I find out
a lot about them and get paid.
But the moment they find out...
She dances that dirty dance
in Banjo's beer bar...
They don't show their face.
In addition don't even pay me!
Do you know what you're doing?
Getting my Bijuriya settled.
You're ruining your life.
These are your days of
studying and playing.
Once I get her married,
I'll enjoy all my life.
How will you get her married?
I won't do it. I pray
to a God every Monday.
He'll do it, I light his lamp.
Had it! Talking to you,
I forgot today is prayer day.
I'm going.
That girl should be given the
court summons now before sunset!
I can't tolerate my master Mayur
staying with her for one minute!
She has no character.
Super vagabond!
- Where is she?
- Who, sir?
Who has just turned 16!
Where is she?
We're in Goa sir.
She lives in Bombay.
I'm in Goa and she's in Bombay!
Turn the ship back now!
- Turn back now!
- Turn back now!
What has come home today?
I beg you, fall at your feet.
Stop showing me the stars.
You've got me stamped as a
vagabond by the government!
This is the notice from
that cheat uncle of Nandu's!
I have no character, a vagabond
so he'll take my child away!
Let me see. Why do
you worry when I'm here?
All the worries rose because of you!
You take all our news
to that foreigner!
And put our lives in danger!
- What are you saying? I...
- Now you be quiet.
You're a man of God.
What can you do but pray?
Now hear me out! Got rid
of brother for property!
Now he wants to take away
my Nandu and parcel him off.
But he hasn't dealt with me!
I'll file a complain against
his whole family at Chinchpokli!
I'll file a case against that rascal!
Yes, write.
He blew up a bomb in a ship.
And write my Nandu should
get his share, right here!
And in cash!
He'll grind the mill
in prison all his life!
It's only the rich who file cases.
Your house will be sold
settling the case.
The poor don't file cases.
They attack.
What do you mean?
I mean he was half infatuated when...
You masqueraded as a queen
and slipped your garment down.
What do you imply?
He lost his senses so much
that he couldn't sleep at night.
And he kept wandering in his
Juliet's village like a Romeo.
Leave prison mills, if you want
he'll grind flour for you forever!
What you say holds water.
You're pouring water on my efforts!
You're chopping off your
own feet with an axe!
Please keep your water, your
axe and havoc to yourself!
I'll take my master Mayur with me!
That's what I want.
But how will you take him?
The child who sees his mother
being maligned dies needlessly!
I did tell you that they
are 2 bodies but one life.
Ad you can take the child
with you with a smile.
So you've brought me
a proposal from her?
I haven't brought
any proposal from her.
I've come to tell you of
a solution from my heart.
You can call her and lovingly...
She herself couldn't express it well.
We share a father and
daughter relationship.
Did she send you to say anything?
She didn't say anything.
Just told me a joke.
The day she came to meet you,
she thought you'd be an old uncle.
But you turned out to be a prince!
And the king of business!
She saw you and grew nervous!
So nervous that she meant
something but said another.
If she hadn't run away,
she'd have fallen at your feet.
She was preparing her trap
for me right from day one!
How she threw her sari off...
You've given me a brilliant idea.
To save master Mayur from her
I'll have to get trapped first.
And show him her true colours.
It will create so much hatred in
his heart that he'll forget her.
Now watch how I sort her out.
Forgive me. It's not that.
- Whatever.
- So begin!
Have you understood?
What did you say your name was?
What's the matter?
Sir, my moustache and my name...
It's my life.
Nobody can forget my name!
- You must not forget. Please.
- Don't do that.
From brewing liquor to
setting a village aflame...
There's nothing I can't do.
Nobody in my family ever died
of a rascal doctor's medicine.
They died but how...?
By a bullet or AK 47 gun.
Very good.
The Lord's blessings.
Why do you keep bending?
Stand straight.
I want to know your plan.
Plan? Stand right here.
When she's dancing tonight...
- The lights will go off.
- Why?
It happens. I'll bring a
screaming Bijuriya out.
You'll come to save her.
And I'll give you a punch.
Don't be scared.
I'll put her in the jeep
and take her away.
Where are you taking her?
You take a motorcycle, start it.
I got it.
And then in great style...
Then you say, Don't you dare!
Rascals! Vile dogs! Scoundrels!
I'll gouge out your eyes
if you look at her!
Then I'll get out a knife.
Hold it.
And say, this is a knife,
not a toy for children.
If it cuts you, blood spurts.
Then one of my men will say
but who are you?
Your death!
Your death!
What dialogue delivery!
This is very silly!
I can't say these dialogues.
Take this back.
If you say all this,
she'll be a slave at your feet!
Stand straight, don't go down!
- What is slave at your feet?
- That means...
She'll do something sinful
as devotion if you say.
No sin and no devotion.
Everything is for Master Mayur.
- Now?
- Just now.
She's gone to Banjo's place.
He's a dangerous man.
You have to stake your life.
I'm not doing it.
Quote the price for your life.
The other shoe too.
Here. Take it.
Bijuriya's show is tonight.
The lights will go off. So will she.
Who sent this?
Your English man.
He wants to take you to dinner.
Thank you mother goddess.
Finally you sent him!
Now he'll feed me dinner
and I'll give him water!
Stop!
I'm coming!
Leave me!
If anyone so much as looks at her...
I'll scratch his eyes out!
This is not a toy.
If it cuts you, blood spurts out.
You have to ask who I am.
And I'll say, your death!
One minute. Where's your boss?
Romeo, who are you?
Your death!
Now I'll hit you.
Not like this.
I'll hit now, not you.
Here's a razor and my moustache.
Shave them off. They have
no right to be on this face.
Go up!
Tell me who they were.
Very dangerous people.
But no need to worry.
- Bend down.
- My duty...
I'll look after everything.
- You're with Damodar.
- Will you leave her?
I have to take her to dinner.
She's going to be somebody's dinner.
And I'll have you for dinner.
That too, raw!
Not like that. This way.
Let go!
Not from the back!
Bad manners to cheat.
What food do you like?
Hold on. I'm coming.
Now shall we go for dinner?
You are great!
You showed your glory!
Don't think I'll forget my
promise because I'm a kid.
I'll make a gold statue!
Now starts the fluttering of her heart
She's not at home.
When she is not at home
The whole village knows.
But that foreign uncle of
yours whose mistress she is...
Only you know where
she has gone with him.
Earned a lot off your mother!
Take me to her!
I'll rip your stomach!
My uncle is in love with her.
He will marry her!
Marry her? He'll suck her
dry and spit in the gutter!
There's still time.
Tell her to return to Banjo.
Or I'll have to deal in the gutter.
His foreign uncle will
marry his Bijuriya!
I'll go to the priest today.
To decide on the marriage date.
Now tell me, where are you
going all dressed like a prince?
I'd gone to the priest.
He's the best priest who
fixes dates for marriages.
And he said, your uncle
is very fortunate.
- Why? - Because the
day after is Ekadashi.
When Lord Krishna
and Tulsi get married.
And right after that...
on the fourth day...
You'll marry Bijuriya!
Our marriage?
Don't get tense.
I've arranged everything. The
wedding dress and jewels are ready.
But I'm warning you,
it's silver not gold.
I'm in a hurry for the wedding...
Because Banjo calls her your
mistress and insults her.
That is why the earlier
you get married, the better.
Somebody has misled you.
Or did you dream of this wedding?
Dream?
How can you call this a dream?
It's not a dream. I saw
what you showed my eyes.
Is what Banjo said, true?
That you won't marry her...
that you...
Hear me out carefully.
You are heir to the great
Mayur family with traditions.
You saw it yourself.
And you only told me...
A man getting his boots
polished on the road...
...didn't want to marry her.
- They were unfortunate!
The one who gets a godly fate...
My God will only arrange
her match with that man!
And you tell me one thing
if you didn't want to marry her...
Why did you do that?
- What did I do to her?
- Which a husband does to his wife.
What do you think of her?
A prostitute? She is not!
She is my mother!
- Try to understand.
- I've understood everything!
Now you understand!
Neither are you anything to me...
Nor am I related to
your sinner family!
If I have somebody,
it is only my mother!
Now I understand,
this was all a bribe!
To separate me from my mother!
I spit at them!
Take them back!
- Try to understand.
- No!
I've understood everything.
Take back everything!
- Take it all!
- That's enough.
Take your bow tie!
Take your jacket and waistcoat!
And your shirt!
Take this and this!
Don't do this.
Here's your master Mayur!
What impression did you have?
Even if you'd brought me the stars...
I'd have kicked them
away for my mother!
Aren't you ashamed?
Despite being a God,
you treated a kid like this!
You didn't even honour
the flowers of my worship!
You ate so many coconuts of mine!
You ate them all up!
I bought them with my earnings!
You can't be God!
But I won't spare you!
I'll tell the villagers about you!
You're a cheat not God!
I'll tell everyone.
Nobody will come to you!
Stay here alone, all night!
That's your punishment!
Understood.
I sold all these,
didn't go to school.
Lied to mother. You're
punishing me for these sins.
But why are you punishing
my Bijuriya for my sins?
What will happen to her?
Where will she go?
Where are you running like crazy?
There's no sign of
Nandu since yesterday.
He went to his foreign uncle
in grand style yesterday.
He must be there.
He's never stayed away from me.
He must have kidnapped him!
He's tied from head to toe.
How can he fly?
Your love has snipped
off his feathers, silly.
You don't know. He came
here to take my son away!
Where is Nandu?
I asked where my Nandu is!
I've spent the night like a decade.
Only to get this answer from you.
Where is Nandu?
I want a simple answer
to my question.
Now you have to answer me!
But first you listen.
Every morning the sun rises.
And spreads its' light
throughout the world.
And right from that time,
there's darkness in the child's life.
He hides his face from that light.
And wipes people's dirty
shoes with his forehead...
And polishes them.
And the same sun sets
in that child's life...
So that he can go to
dens of black marketing.
He can sell all these
and collect every penny!
Lies! All lies!
I may not be very rich...
But I've fulfilled every wish
of my child before he asked for it!
You've always been mistaken.
Neither have you ever
understood the joy in his heart...
Nor his sorrow.
Your dirty profession.
...is his biggest sorrow.
And do you know
what's his biggestjoy?
To give you a respectable life.
To settle you down.
And for this and to get you married...
That child's childhood...
...has been murdered!
No. My Nandu cannot
be my misfortune.
My baby!
Don't call him a baby.
In the form of a child...
He has become an old father!
He begs every passerby.
Is there anyone?
Will anybody hold
my Bijuriya's hand?
He came to me with the same request.
I've understood.
This is your last trick
to take my child away!
Such aspersions on my character!
You'll never be reborn as a man!
I curse you!
I accept your curse. I'm willing
to be reborn as the devil each time.
But in this birth,
for the welfare of this boy...
I will have this answer from you!
Where is Nandu?
Mother...
Have you ever seen
such a fortunate bride?
Who has this make-up in her fate,
more precious than your stars!
What kind of prank is this?
I'm so unfortunate.
My maternal love
turned out to be venom!
A witch who ate her child alive!
Where were you all night?
Your mother was so worried.
Why don't you answer?
Mother, give me strength.
I want to cultivate so much
hatred in my child's heart...
That he hates the thought of me!
That I can break his heart.
Give me the strength!
You have to keep a mother's word!
Come here.
When you knew I love Banjo,
that's the only joy in my life...
Why did you go to your
relative with my proposal?
Answer me!
Did I rear you for this?
Why are you standing dumb?
Why don't you answer?
You love that sinner, Banjo!
Want to marry him. Then what
were you doing with my uncle?
- Claiming my right.
- What right do you have?
Scoundrel! You're asking me my right?
You jinx! Ate your parents on birth!
Listen to my right. You had nobody
On my mercy you've grown so big!
Every drop of your blood, part
of your body is owned by me!
Your studies, medicines, eggs
and butter every morning!
Who paid for that? Your relative?
- 8 rotis smeared with butter in a
day! Did somebody donate them?
Come here son of Bijuriya!
Did somebody from the
sky fill milk for you?
Don't they cost money?
Count them all!
You'll fill all your copies but
my rights won't be accounted for!
Come here! Why are you
acting before an actress!
Look here. The food
is crying for you!
- Eat you free loader!
- I won't eat. - What?
I never ate for free!
I thought it was my right!
And I won't eat today either!
I'll never come here! I'm going!
I'm going to my uncle!
Go! I couldn't get
married because of you.
Now I can be at peace! Get lost!
I'm going but with a promise!
I'll never drink water in your house!
Listen!
You turned so crazy for money
that you sacrificed Nandu!
Bad times!
That's enough!
Men never cry.
- Tell me what's wrong.
- How can I?
What did you say?
She wants her rights?
Don't cry.
Now tell me what she told you.
Tell me everything.
She said she's not my mother.
She called you my relative.
She's asking money for feeding me!
She wants to be paid for feeding me!
Your crying is not right.
Crying is harmful.
She says the bread was
smeared with butter!
Did she say that?
But was it smeared?
She wants to be paid for it!
It was absolutely dry!
Very bad to apply butter on bread.
But if she said it, it's bad.
Now stop crying.
We'll pay her dues.
She took me from my mother
even before I was born.
Nandlal is my son!
She fought with everyone and
forcibly raised me herself!
Did I ask her to do it?
She has no right! I won't go!
It would have been better if
they had sent me to an orphanage!
What happened about the
Not after 4 days!
I want them tomorrow!
You can do nothing!
Call my London office and leave
instructions to charter a plane!
I told you the child isn't well...
How dare you return! Come!
I'll make mincemeat of you
and feed it to the fish!
You hit a drunk.
That was very bad.
I won't spare you when I get sober.
Englishman has come!
Are you sleeping?
He's waiting outside.
The door is open.
Excuse me, there's a special
item today. Getting ready for it.
Yes, I understand.
Why did you bother to come?
I had to talk to you about your right
Whether you feel bad or good,
I'll take the entire sum in cash.
You may take your cheque back.
This is not a cheque.
It's a court document.
That you have received full
payment of raising master Mayur.
You have to sign here.
Signature.
How can I just sign?
I must first get my dues.
Take your time to arrange for cash.
Come over when you do.
I'm in no hurry.
I've arranged for the cash.
Where is it?
Bring it in.
I had promised to square
your account of rights.
I've come to keep that word.
The thought of your right
never came to my heart.
So how could I account for it?
And you never kept accounts
even with the grocer.
So how could you account
for so many years?
I'm giving you a blank
cheque along with this bag.
Thank you very much.
Signature.
Wait. This document is in English.
And you don't know English.
So I'll explain to you
what's written in it.
It says after signing this paper...
Miss Bijuriya has no
rights over master Mayur.
If she ever wants to meet her Nandu...
Master Mayur. If she ever
tries to write or call him up...
It will be considered an offense.
And I'll never think of her!
I'm a jinx! I ate
my parents on birth!
You raised me, brought me up.
Do me one last favour.
Don't come to the
airport to see this jinx!
This is a legal document.
If you wish, you can show
it to your legal adviser.
There's still time.
Come soon.
- Why have you come?
- Shut up!
I've come for my loot! Where's it?
What loot?
No!
- Let go!
- No!
That belongs to my child!
This belongs to an innocent
child. I must return it!
I beg you! I plead with you!
Have mercy!
Mercy? How will that
come to my heart?
You know how big a bastard he is.
Will you obey him?
I'll do anything you say!
If I want something now,
I want itjust now!
Quote the price in your heart.
She is priceless.
Her heart and profession is priceless.
But for that Englishman she
kept neither her face nor mine!
That is why I'm selling her.
You want my stuff?
Then bid as per your position!
You want to see my position!
You've done me a great favour.
This uncle had dreams for you.
It cried at your sorrows.
What blessings I asked for you.
- But what happened...
- No uncle!
You've done me a favour
by finding Nandu's family.
And this beggar who came to
your house dressed as a queen...
Has really become a queen!
She has earned so much wealth.
- Didn't you hear?
- I did but my heart...
Time is flying past. It's almost
time for Nandu's plane to leave.
This belongs to Nandu. Give it
to him and do me one more favour.
That's why I called you.
It contains his toys.
I understood.
You won't come to see him off.
All the joys of your life are gone.
And also give the blessing that
joys always be by your side!
Good bye.
Forgive me if possible.
- What's this?
- Bijuriya has sent toys for him.
Sent toys? Couldn't come herself?
I don't want them!
Give it to me.
You've accounted for
Bijuriya's rights.
And she kept the money.
And you told her not to come
to see you off at the airport.
But it's our custom.
When somebody goes abroad...
His family comes to see him off.
I'm going away forever.
No!
I'll come!
Where are you running off?
Nandu is calling me. If he gets
out of control, it will be terrible.
He'll come back running. All my
efforts will be ruined. Let me go!
Either come with me...
Now you're neither mine nor your own.
I've auctioned you off. Come.
Bhim Khalasi must be waiting for you
No!
Leave her! Where are you taking her?
Poison! Why?
- She's calling me!
- No!
She's calling me. I must go!
No uncle!
She's calling me. I must go!
Who is Vikram?
The Englishman with this cheap tart!
The cheap tart is called Bijuriya!
I said she's mine. Can't you hear?
Where are you going?
Nobody touch him.
It's a matter of hearts.
The decision will be between us.
Nobody will shoot.
You want her? Take her.
Come and take her.
I've come to take her with me.
But before that...
The dirty hands with
which you touched her...
I'll make those hands
apologise to her!
You're the one who will apologise!
Because I'll show you your place!
Never forget your place!
This is what you're worth!
No! Not yet! Now the
last exhibition is left!
Shoot them!
First you will apologise.
What should man never forget?
Never forget his position.
Live long.
This girl I've accepted as
daughter is my life's earning.
I've given her to you. What else
does this mendicant have to give?
One Mahuwa betel
