a legion of mighty men have left
the symbols of their greatness.
these are the symbols
of one of the mightiest men of all.
With the passing years, however,
reality has given way to legend.
Until today, we know this remarkable man
simply as Johnny Appleseed.
This is his story, told by an old settler
who knew Johnny well.
Well, sir,
every time I see an apple-blossom sky,
Because of course
them clouds up there,
Why, there wouldn't be
no apple-blossom sky
Guess I better start back
to the beginning.
And that's when Johnny lived on a farm
near Pittsburgh town.
The year was 1806
or maybe there around.
you'd say Johnny Appleseed
never would make a pioneer.
He was such a sawed-off
scrawny little fella.
He had his apple trees
and the morning sun
Oh, here am I
Neath the blue, blue sky
But lately, little Johnny here
would feel a stirring in the air.
A rumbling, rolling under bead
of restless men and restless feet.
He weren't no pioneer
and he knowed it.
And them folks going west
to build this nation
sure made picking apples
look like a plum useless occupation.
Well, sir,
that's when a miracle happened.
Well, what's holding you, Johnny?
Go on. Go on out west
if that's your choice.
Might look mighty queersome
to you and me,
but you know, that's just the way
John figured he'd be.
Well, speak up, boy.
Don't stand there gawking.
Unlock your jaw and get to talking.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why don't I go west?
Because I ain't got the muscle
or the breadth of chest.
Out there it's the strong men
who's surviving.
I'm about the puniest fella alive.
Shame to you, Johnny.
You got faith and courage
and a level head.
But you see, sir,
all I know is apple trees.
And what's wrong with apples,
if you please?
Ain't they about the finest fruit
in all the land?
Why... Why, shoot, man,
they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny,
of all the things that apples make.
There's apple pickles.
And apple pastry, apple dumplings
Not to mention...
- Apple sauce?
- Yes.
- Tangy apple cider in a glass
- Tangy apple cider in a glass
- Apple-pie and apple-cake them.
- Yep.
- There's a lot of work to do
- There's a lot of work to do
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.
You see, sir, I ain't got the traps,
ain't got the gear.
Or none of the things I'll need out there.
You ain't got the...
Dad gummit, boy. I'm ashamed of you.
You got the stuff to see you through.
Why, you got all the seeds
you're needing.
And for pretty darn good reading...
Here's a mighty handy bonnet.
Even got a handle on it.
- There's a lot of work out there to do
- There's a lot of work out there to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
That's how Johnny, all alone,
set out to meet the great unknown.
It was a mighty big and fearsome place
for a man to face.
Walked until at last he found
a little spot of open ground
Now, the varmints here,
they couldn't know
But if Johnny seen him,
he paid no heed.
Now, them varmints
come from everywhere,
till here come along
a black and white cat.
Now, he weren't too bright,
but he didn't much care.
Why, this little man
had went and busted every precedent.
every last living varmint
was a friend to John.
Johnny kept right on
a- planting his apple trees
For, of course, John was planting
more than an apple tree.
He was planting his own boundless faith
and courage too.
And as more and more pioneers
come to push back the forest,
the kindly deeds
of little Johnny Appleseed
And more than once
with a good old-fashioned jubilee
Now, sometimes
if John was a-passing by,
he'd mosey over
and kind of look in on the doings.
Because it sure tickled him
to see how the fruit of his labours
brought all kinds of folks together
and made them good neighbours.
Come and get it.
The food is on the table set.
It's all a-waiting to be eat.
Come and get it.
- Apple pickles.
- Mighty tasty.
- Apple butter.
- Apple pastry.
- Apple dumpling.
- How'd you like some applesauce?
Yes, ma'am.
Yep, Johnny did bring folks
a heap of happiness.
if he aims to plant
the whole darn wilderness
John walked and planted
that old frontier.
Yes, sir,
he throwed his shadow
clear across the land
across a hundred thousand
miles square.
Boy, for sleeping you take the cake.
Come on, get up.
We got a longsome trip to make.
Oh, why, Mr. Angel. How do you do?
I'm fine. And how be you?
I'm fine. Just feeling...
Who is that
sleeping in the evening dusk?
Why, that's just your husk, John.
Your mortal husk.
My husk?
You mean to say I'm...?
I'm passed away?
Dagnabbit, angel. I just can't go.
Got crops to harvest, seeds to sow.
Now, now, now. Hold on, boy.
Down here on Earth,
your work is through.
But yonder?
Well, we need you, Johnny.
Yep, we sure do.
You think we had most all we please,
but we ain't.
We're kind of short on apple trees.
Well, I swan. I didn't know.
What are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go.
- There's a lot of work up there to do
- There's a lot of work up there to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
- Oh, there's a lot of work to do
whenever I see that certain sky,
I think of little John.
from John's heavenly orchard
of apple trees.
