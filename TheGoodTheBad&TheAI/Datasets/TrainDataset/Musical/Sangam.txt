Don't forget to wish
the lawyer.
''Come here, Nathu.''
''- Yes, sir.''
You're so very late!
''l'm hungry. Let's go, Gopal.''
''- Come on, Sunder.''
Sunder hit Gopal and
he's bleeding.
They're fighting again.
Will you say that again?
- Yes.
''What happened, Gopal?''
Did Sunder hit you?
''- No, father.''
l fell on a stone
and started bleeding.
But Radha said Sunder hit you.
She's lying.
- Yes he did! He did hit him!
''Shut up, Radha!''
When did he hit me?
''She's lying, father!''
''Well done, my son.''
You're bleeding but you won't
tattle on your friend.
''Look, Radha. l've built a house''
big enough for Gopal too.
Will you live in my house now?
''- No, l won't.''
Why not?
- lt's my wish!
l don't like your house!
Had it been someone else
in your place...
Let me go!
''Well? Don't you know, l was''
a Captain in the army?
''Let him be, sir''
He's a kid.
''Keep him under control, Nathu.''
He's getting out of hand.
You're being like a child yourself.
''Go ahead and play, children''
''Play with Gopal, Radha.''
Always play with equals.
He has a car.
But l have a plane.
l'll fly Radha all over the world.
l'll take her away one day.
No...
Come down here and l'll show you!
Sunder! What are you doing?!
l threw the hook in the water
and it fell on the ground.
Return my clothes to me!
They won't get off the hook.
Like myself.
Say that again... l like
my name on your lips.
Don't tease me.
Return my clothes to me!
l will. But answer my
question first.
l have a hundred times.
You've refused a hundred times
Say `yes' just once...
or you won't get your clothes
- This is ridiculous.
lmagine for a moment that
l'm not Sunder... but Gopal.
And Gopal asks you something.
''Your heart is the river Ganga''
''and mine is the river Yamuna''
''Tell me, Radha...''
''will they ever find union?''
''No! Never!''
''l've spend eons''
''pleading with you''
''You'll find no other man''
''as persistent as l am''
''Will this burden''
''l carry, ever lessen?''
''Tell me, Radha...''
''will our hearts ever meet?''
''Get lost!''
''l thirst for you as''
''the earth does for rain''
''Every breath that l take''
''seems to chant your name''
''The stones melt,''
''but will your heart?''
''Tell me, Radha,...''
''will our hearts ever meet?''
''Yes, they will!''
''Now go away''
''Radha, listen...''
Gopal's returning from
London tomorrow!
Do you hear?
Gopal's returning from London!
Aunty!
She's in the prayer room.
What happened?
- Gopal...
What happened? He was okay...
- Not just okay.
He's great! He has stood first
in the whole of the University!
Really?
- Of course.
l'm the one who tutored him!
''Read this, if you can't believe me.''
l'll go and tell everyone.
''- Sweeten your tongue, at least.''
Later!
Raghu! Look at this...
Sunder isn't here.
''He knows, doesn't he?''
Of course. He's been
telling everyone.
Why hasn't he come then?
He will. At least to the party.
- Party?
Yes. ln your honour.
''Well, lawyer?''
How are you?
Why didn't you come
to receive me?
l did. On my bicycle.
But you sped away in your car.
l kept calling for you
but you wouldn't hear me.
''You're wearing garlands,''
l see.
This one? l brought it for you.
''l wore it, because l didn't meet you.''
What's the difference between
the two of us anyway?
l feel as if l've turned a lawyer
after you got the degree.
'' But now that l meet you,''
''here you are, my friend.''
You've been away
for so very long.
Let's sit here.
Have you quit the Air Force
and joined flight work?
Yes. l train people
in flying.
But l don't get the one
l want to take to the skies.
l can't tell you what l went through
when l met Gopal today.
Mustn't you ask Gopal too?
Do you mean?
- No.
To play together as kids
''is one thing, Radha.''
But to live together as husband
and wife is another.
All right. l will say it
to him at the party tonight.
Congratulations. You're one
of us lawyers now.
Thank you. Please sit down.
''Why're you hiding here, Captain?''
l'm watching how the game goes.
Fine. But you've glass is empty.
Let me get you a drink.
What shall l get you?
- Don't l get a drink?
What can l get you?
- Ask what l've got for you.
What've you got?
- Look there.
l'm here for the
fun of it.
But she's here to say
something to you.
What?
- Only she knows.
l forgot...
Let me get you a drink.
Don't bother
- l'll get it...
Not you. There's no dearth
of servants in this house.
Let her. lt's time she learns
the ways of this family.
After all she has to
come here as a bride.
You look lovely.
Who's it all for?
What was Sakina saying?
- The truth.
''l mean, what did she say?''
- That you wanted to speak to me.
''Congratulations, Gopal.''
- Thanks
You look lovely.
Sunder hasn't come yet.
Strange fellow!
Did you speak?
How could l? There're too
many people around.
Your friend Sunder isn't here?
- Must be on his way.
Here he is!
Can't you ever be on time?
Not even today?
l can't hide things from you.
l have only one suit.
My pants were torn and
l had to sew them.
l wanted to dress well.
''Radha's coming, you know.''
ls she here?
- Yes
Where's she?
- There.
Tell Gopal everything
you want to.
''How can l, with that fool''
hovering around him?
''Stay close, Gopal.''
My heart could stop beating...
And my pulse?
Go and say `hi'.
l'll join you later.
Must l?
- Go on!
Oh no! He's coming here.
l'll take care of Sunder.
Go and find Gopal.
''Welcome, Sunder.''
Say MlSTER Sunder.
l'm suited and booted
Right. MlSTER Sunder.
We don't meet nowadays.
Quite right. We hardly meet.
Talk to Sakina. l'll be back.
So talk to me.
About what?
- About Radha.
Radha? Go ahead.
l'm told you love her.
- ls it public knowledge?
May l suggest something?
- Please do.
Ask Radha what she wants.
Suppose you both want
different things?
That's why l'm here - to
confess my feelings.
l'll ask her today.
Don't worry.
Will you have a drink?
Excuse me.
Do you see how different
Sunder and Gopal are?
''One, a worthy son of''
a worthy father.
He's a lawyer and will
be a judge one day.
The other one's a
good-for-nothing.
And he comes here today
like a band-master.
''Say whatever you will,''
but Sunder is a gem of a boy.
''Which is why, Captain,''
he's my dearest friend.
You're always biased
against him.
Never mind his appearance.
He's the life and soul of any party.
What is it?
Did you meet Sunder?
l came to say something to you.
l've never dared to say it
to you before.
''The Judge wants you, son.''
Come on.
l'll be back.
Your friend isn't eating.
''Sunder, won't you eat?''
- l can't. l'll choke.
Why?
Not unless l speak to her.
l'm incapable of anything.
How will you speak?
Will you play?
Yes. l'll play and sing.
Very good. Music gives
life meaning.
''Which is why, a heart that''
''loves, will speak in song.''
Wonderful.
- Such poetry.
Then develop the poem.
- Go on.
Every heart that loves
will speak out in song.
and a lover in a crowd
will stand out.
Wonderful!
''A heart that loves''
''will speak out in song''
''A lover in a crowd''
''will stand out''
''Having stolen my heart,''
''you hide yourself from me''
''Though my love is unrequited,''
''my feelings for you abide''
''This is what love is about;''
''although you do not know it''
''The candle-flame that burns''
''will draw the moth to it''
''Forgotten memories''
''of our happy childhood''
''come to trouble''
''my dreams at night''
''l've never dared''
''to speak my heart''
''Though countries seasons''
''have come and gone''
''When will these eyes''
''be brave enough to speak?''
''A lover in a crowd''
''will stand out''
''Everyone has spoken...''
''but l cannot speak my heart''
''The story of my heart''
''shall remain forever untold''
''Having united two hearts,''
''this outsider will leave''
''A lover in a crowd will be''
''recognised, without doubt''
''Sakina, won't you dance?''
Forget about me. Ask Radha.
You wouldn't know how much
l have waited for you.
l'm writing this to
answer your question.
But l don't know myself
what the answer is.
Shameless! Reading
another's letter?
Another? So you've discarded
all of us for him?
Never mind. l'll deliver
the letter for you.
As if l couldn't do it myself.
- So why did you keep it here?
l thought l'd give it to him.
- Really?
Now wait..
l'm taking this paper along.
l'll send you the draft notice.
Mr lawyer... could you
come upstairs please?
Sakina's calling you!
Let me accompany you...
Where are you going?
Sakina called him.
- lt was Radha; not Sakina.
l'm not bothered. l'm going too...
- Why not?
''The army captain, aren't you?''
Come on now!
All right... let's go.
Did you call me?
- Not me. lt was Radha.
''Well, Radha?''
Tell him!
- What's bothering you?
''ln that case, l'll tell him.''
''Actually, Radha has...''
Looks like you've been joking.
And l got taken in.
You didn't give him
''the letter, Radha.''
What's the hurry?
l will give it to him.
He's sitting downstairs.
- He's leaving!
l'll give it to him.
C'mon!
My God!
What do we do now?
- Deliver the letter?
Hurry up.
''Coming, father.''
''Come, let's go. lf father''
''comes up, it's the end.''
lt's in Hindi.
My teacher always said one
should learn Hindi.
l wish l had learnt it.
Gopal! l've got it!
- Got what?
A priceless treasure!
''That is, this letter.''
Letter?
- Yes! lt will decide my fate
''l'm at your mercy, Gopal!''
- What are you doing?
Only you can read and
tell me my fate
''Tell me, friend, if l'm''
on the Everest or in the hell ?
What does it say ?
Beloved ...
Beloved ?
Say it again.
- Beloved.
''Take this cup away,''
for l am drunk.
What kind of a joke is this ?
- You won't understand. Read on
ln your eyes l have seen a question.
Am l right ?
Absolutely! Read on
l am writing to answer
your question
''Go and, give me my answer!''
''The answer is, l don't know''
what my answer is
l dream of the things
l would tell you
'' But l stand before you,''
and my tongue is tied
This is an ancient story...
that has inspired poets
Maybe this is love
''Yours, Radha''
My...? Radha ?
''Hold me Gopal, ere l fall''
''What's melodrama is this, Sunder ?''
- This is love
This thing called love
ls a river of fire
that drowns the lover
l've seen my share of
drowning lovers
Happens only in poetry.
Have you ever been in love ?
- Yes
With whom ?
- Radha.
ls there only one
Radha in the world ?
Which other Radha ?
There was one Radha.
She was Lord Krishna's beloved
Oh...that Radha ?
''For a moment, l almost died''
''Look, my hands have gone cold.''
My blood seems to have turned to ice
l'm madly in love with Radha!
l can't live without her
'' But believe me, if you were in love''
''with my Radha, l would've given her up''
lt'd break my heart. But l'd sacrifice
my love for friendship
What are you lost in?
l'm right here with you
l was thinking...
- You think more than you do
''Tell me, what do l do?''
''You just do what l say,''
and no arguments
''All right, no arguments.''
''- First, we go boating tomorrow''
''Yes, it's a Sunday''
But l have work
Can't you give a day for me?
''- For you, l'd even give up my life''
Then give your life.
Come with me
Pick up the phone
Dial a number
This is Radha's number.
- Right. Tell her that...
you're going boating tomorrow
''Hello, Captain. Gopal here.''
- You pick up Radha at three...
How are you?
- Doesn't matter!
''Captain, tomorrow being a Sunday,''
we're going boating
Very well. Radha will come too
Gopal called. He has invited us
to go boating with him tomorrow
Us ?
- And Radha too
Radha too? Or Radha only?
l don't know... but l'm going!
''- But of course, you won't''
''Leave her alone. For her, it has''
just begun. Let it happen
What better a match for Radha?
''Now, how would l know all that?''
- How would you? All you know...
''is that in 1916, you were a Captain.''
- Was l not ?
Big party?
- No. Small party. For two
Get lost
Radha sits here
Here's Gopal
And here l am
Radha of the intoxicating eyes
''And Gopal, the friend in need''
''My friend, and my lover''
ls this any time to come ?
l've been waiting all my life
Did you invite Sunder too ?
- He's the one who invited us
The phone call ?
- He made me call you
What're you waiting for ?
Come along
How are you Radha ?
l hear you've bought a boat ?
Yes. l'm sailing today.
lt's a sight
lt's a lovely boat
- Show me
''Go on Gopal, take a look''
- l'm coming too
Where are you off to ?
l'm showing you my boat. Come
Who are you looking at ? Gopal ?
- No...
Mothing wrong. Not a friend like him
in the whole world
''When l'm in pain, he cries''
''When l'm happy, he rejoices.''
Like yesterday
What happened yesterday ?
- Read your letter
''You read it, too ?''
''- No, Gopal did''
Gopal and l share all our secrets.
''Nice, isn't it?''
Where's your boat ?
How is it ?
Such a small one ?
How many can sit in it ?
- Two. You and l
''Two's a pair, three is a crowd,''
and four makes a gang of thieves
Which is the pair ?
There's only one pair. You and l.
l'm right. Am l not ? Tell me
How do you like my boat ?
- Beautiful
''Come over, then''
Radha won't sit in your rotten boat.
- Then will she sit in your tub ?
She who sails with me
sits in my heart
That's a bloody lorry.
- She's a nymphet
Nymphet ? She's a paper boat.
And those girls are paper dolls
Don't you show off.
Take that junk out of the waters
''He puts a lorry in the water,''
and he goes begging for passengers
Good riddance !
So what were you saying ?
Can you say how deep the lake is ?
- Maybe 20 or 30 feet
ls there anything deeper ?
- Why not? The ocean
Deeper than the ocean ?
- l don't know
''Your eyes, Radha, your eyes.''
Let me drown in them
''Sunder, this is what l don't like. You''
always make a joke out of everything
''Sometimes, you're fun, but... l know''
you're good at heart. And l like you.
But everything has limits and
sometimes you cross the limit
''Tell me then, what are my limits ?''
l don't know.
- Tell me Radha! What are my limits?
l don't know !
''- Tell me, what are the limits ?''
l don't know! l don't know!
''Oh, my beloved...''
''Oh my beloved''
''To reach your heart''
''is my only goal''
''There is no corner in my life...''
''that you do not invade''
''Why are you angry ?''
''Why so sad ?''
''There is no need, for our hearts''
''shall know union''
''l shall take you in the''
''circle of my arms''
''l shall carry you away, someday''
''Oh, my beloved''
''To reach your heart''
''is my only goal''
Radha ? Gopal here
ls the Captain at home ?
- No
And your mother ?
''She's out, too. Can't you tell me ?''
- l'm coming this evening to see them
Tell them it's important.
We have to discuss something
Discuss ?
- Yes. About you
About me ?
''Sakina, do you know''
who called ? Gopal
He's coming to meet father
about something important
About me. What could it be ?
''Tell me, Sakina''
''He'll say, l don't like Radha!''
She's ugly and she's foolish
Marry her off to Sunder
Don't you ever say that again!
Don't even joke about it
Serve the drinks and leave. Girls
mustn't be present on such ocassions
''Why not, Ma ?''
He won't be able to talk freely
Be seated
How are you ?
- Fine. And you ?
''Fine, thank you''
How are you ?
''- Fine, thank you''
And your mother ?
''- Fine, thank you''
How are you ?
''Fine, thank you. And you ?''
''Fine, thank you''
You... here ?
What madness is this? Why did you
have to scale the wall?
For you l could wade through
''a river of fire, the sea of death''
What kind of a joke is this?
''Sunder, please go away''
'' But, why ?''
''Downstairs, they're discussing''
something important. About me
l know
Gopal is here.
- Naturally. Who else do l have ?
''Oh, why don't you understand?''
Go away now
Till death do we part
You look beautiful
''l tell you again, Sunder''
is a wonderful match
You expect me to give my Radha away
to that oaf?
''He has neither education, nor wealth''
How will he maintain my Radha ?
''lf someone asks what he does,''
what am l to say ?
That he left the Air Force
to join a flying club?
No way
Marriage will make Sunder
a responsible man.
He's a gem of a person.
- But l am no jeweller
l'm sorry to be refusing you
l know you're his friend and
you've come here for his sake
But l'm helpless
May l suggest something ?
- Yes ?
We'd be willing to let
Radha marry you
Me ?
Consider it
- l can never
Are we so lowly ?
- l didn't mean that
There must be a reason
ls Radha unworthy ?
- What are you saying?
The man who gets to marry her
will be very lucky
Then what's your objection ?
- Objection ?
Not a matter of objection.
A matter of obligation
''l'm just as helpless,''
as you are
''Out of my way, Sunder''
How can l ? My fate
is to be decided today
''Then, hear me out ! l don't like you.''
Have you ever seen your face ?
l see it now. ln your eyes.
And it looks all right
''No, it doesn't ! A man must''
be more than just a funster
What must he be ?
- Let me go
Tell me what a man must be
and l'll become that
l don't know !
Don't tell Radha that
Gopal came for Sunder
Just say he came to talk
of marriage...
and we said we'd
think it over
One can't say 'yes' at the
very beginning
l'm sure Gopal will be back
to say that he'll marry her
''l tried everything, Sunder, but...''
''- Say no more, Gopal''
'' Believe me, l tried''
- Why are you repeating it?
l don't want you to think that...
- Does it remain to be said that...
you'd leave no stone unturned for me?
l have to become something.
Radha said that too
A man must make more of himself
than just a clown
l will. l'll make myself worthy
''Don't be sad. Come on, smile''
Keep smiling. Always
You have a beautiful smile
Only Radha's smile can match
the beauty of your smile
Her smile is as radiant as
all the sunflowers in the world
''Well, then...''
Where are you taking me?
''- Come with me, l'll explain''
What is the matter? Where are we
headed? l don't understand this
You'll come to know
''So boys, you have been briefed about''
your mission.
Only one more thing l've to tell you.
Don't forget...
that you are flying
the lndian Air Force
And the Air Force has full faith
''in your courage, and your patriotism''
Sunder... you... here ?
What's this Sunder? This uniform...
these planes...? What's all this?
lt was you who told me that there's
more to life than being just a clown
A man must make something of himself
''This is an Air Force uniform,''
and l fly that airplane
l'm flying off today.
- Where ?
l'm not allowed to reveal that
''Just a minute, Gopal''
l'm leaving. l don't know
when l'll return
'' Before l leave, l want''
to tell you something
''Go ahead, Sunder''
You're everything to me...
''mother, father, brother and friend''
While l am gone no third man
must come between Radha and me
Say you promise
''Tell me Gopal, you promise''
''l promise, Sunder''
lt's another matter if l die
- Die ?
''What are you saying, Sunder?''
''l won't die, Radha. l won't die.''
l'll come back to you... for you
''Sunder, listen...''
''Sunder, listen to me''
l have something to tell you
Don't get the wrong idea
''l don't love you, Sunder''
l don't love you !
''Take care, Sunder''
l won't die Radha
l'll come back to you... for you
''Gopal, l can face every danger''
in this world
What l can't fight is the darkness
in my mind...
which seem to grow when
l don't hear from Radha
A darkness that not all the light
in the universe can quell
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me
''Else, l'll go mad''
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me
''Else, l'll go mad''
''Remember, how we used to play family''
when we were kids?
''You and l, and Sunder''
You would insist that
l stay with you
''And Sunder used to say,''
Radha will live with me
He says that even today.
- Even today ?
Why haven't you answered
his letters ?
l just haven't.
- Why not ?
''Child's play is one thing, and making''
a family is quite something else
''For me, Sunder is no more''
than a childhood friend
lf you had a woman's heart
you'd know my feelings
What are your feelings ?
l love someone else.
- Whom ?
You
Are you mad ?
- No. But you're driving me mad
Even hearing this is a sin for me!
- Then l shall pay for your sins
'' But tell me, for once,''
have you never loved me ?
No!
- You're lying! Lying
Your relationship with Sunder
has always silenced you
''Were it not for my friendship,''
l would've told you something today
''l plead with you, tell me''
what you want to say
l want to talk of Sunder
who's battling death
''Day and night, he lives''
in the shadow of death
He has only one image
before his eyes
Yours
''lf he wanted to suffer, why''
did he have to choose you?
l have enough pain of my own.
Why did l choose you ?
Kishan...
What is it ?
A letter. ln Hindi. From Radha.
Read it out for me
Dear Sunder...
Take care of yourself.
You said you'd return to me
l wait for that day.
''Yours, Radha''
Mine. Radha
You're lucky to have Radha's love
and Gopal's friendship
''Yours, Radha''
The teacher was right.
The knowledge of Hindi is necessary
''Sing something else, won't you?''
You're always singing that sad song
There's much in life
to be happy about
You have reason to be happy. Your
girlfriend didn't break your heart
Your friend didn't betray you.
''Else, you too would've said it too''
''My friend, is a friend no more.''
''My love, is my love no more''
''My life, l trust you not''
Nothing can be done.
Our men are besieged
We can't even send them supplies
Why not ?
The planes can't reach them
The opening to the valley
is narrow...
and every inch is being held
by the enemy
Give me permission sir.
Let me try
You're a bomber pilot.
This needs a Dakota
No job is too small in times of war.
''Give me the permission, sir.''
You're asking for death
Death for myself.
Life for my brother soldiers
''Give me a chance, sir. l promised''
someone l'd do something worthy.
Let me go
l told him he was asking
for death
''He said, it would mean life''
for his brother soldiers
Just what l feared
What a man he was
We regret to inform you that
''your friend, Flt.Lt. Sunder Khanna...''
met his death while
fighting the enemy
This award is presented
posthumously...
''to Flt.Lt. Sunder Khanna,''
who risked his life to drop supplies
to soldiers at the front
He gave his life to filfill
his mission
but he battled death as he
continued to drop supplies
Flt.Lt. Khanna has upheld the highest
ideals of the Air Force
''His courage, his spirit of sacrifice''
and his sense of duty
will go down in the annals of the
lndian Air Force in golden letters
For selfless service
to the country...
the Government of lndia presents
this award to Flt.Lt. Khanna
Flt.Lt. Khanna's dear friend
l won't die. l'll come back...
to you... for you
His words still echo in my ears
''l'll return, Radha. l will.''
To you...for you
What a man he was.
So full of love
He'd sacrifice his life
for a friend...
and the world
for his beloved
While leaving he entrusted
something to me
His beloved ?
You knew ?
l told him...
not to misunderstand...
that l didn't love him
''l loved you, Gopal...''
l love you
Tell me the truth.
Don't you love me ?
''You do, don't you ?''
''Do l write ''''My beloved''''?''
''Do l write ''''My Beauty''''?''
''Or do l say ''''My sweetheart''''?''
l'm at a loss
What should l write?
Let go of my dress!
- Give me my letter
''Let go, l say''
''- First, my letter''
Why ?
Aren't you ashamed of reading
someone else's love-letter ?
Aren't you ashamed of writing
love-letters ?
''Do not be angry''
''when you read my letter''
''For you are my life,''
''you are my very own''
''l could call you the moon,''
''but the moon is flawed''
''l could call the sun,''
''but the sun is not perfect''
''The only thing left to say''
''is that l love you''
''You're as pure as the Ganga,''
''as pristine as the Yamuna''
''You're so close to my heart''
''that you are my very being''
''l fear that l might die''
''waiting for you to be mine''
''Do not be angry''
''when you read my letter''
''For you are my life,''
''you are my very own''
Gopal! My son! My darling!
Come with me.
- What is the matter?
Take your father's blessings
What's happening ?
Do it. Pay him your obeisances.
- But what's it about?
''Ask for your father's blessings,''
Mr Magistrate
Magistrate ?
- You've become a magistrate
May you live long.
Ask for his blessings
Your son has fulfilled
your wish
''Son, vow that you shall''
always do justice
''l vow, l shall always do justice''
''- First of all, give me justice''
What...?
- Get a daughter-in-law for me
As you wish. Have l ever disobeyed
you? Go ahead and do what you want
Then l'll go to her house
to finalise the match right today
'' But, who's the girl ?''
- As if you don't know...?
How would l know ? l practise law.
l don't chase girls
Radha
- Who ? Radha ?
''Oh, well ...''
- Why? Don't you like her ?
How does that matter ? A noose is
''a noose, be it of silk or cotton''
l know everything
''When you read my letter,''
do not be angry
''For you are my life,''
my very own
''That l am, for others. But for you,''
l will always remain the same.
Your willing prisoner
- Prisoner ?
My mother will go to see
your mother very soon
Why ?
''She'll say, ''''You have a queen''
''in your house, and l have a slave''
Then the queen will buy this slave
And your mother will take home
a devoted maid
Gopal ! Come here
l've been waiting for you.
''- What is it, Ma ?''
l nearly went mad with joy
when l heard the news
What news?
- You'll be overjoyed to hear it
Read this. Sunder is alive
God be thanked !
What else could l want?
You've become a magistrate.
l'm getting a daughter-in-law
''And now, God has given me''
Sunder back too
l'm going to the temple.
l must thank The Gods
''l didn't know this, Sunder''
You don't know what a terrible thing
l was about to do
''l was about to betray you,''
usurp your place
''Had it happened, how would l''
have faced you ?
What man would've trusted
a friend then?
What man would swear
by friendship then?
''Thank God, you're alive''
''Did you hear, Gopal ?''
Sunder is alive !
l'm so happy l can't tell you
How could we have got
married without him ?
Our wedding would've
been incomplete
Hurry! lt's time for the train
Get up ! Move
l'm not going.
- Why ?
lf he doesn't see you with me at
''the station, what will he think?''
That's what l'm wondering. lf he sees
''you with me, what will he say?''
''He'll say, ''''Congratulations Gopal,''
''Radha is yours''
And what do l say ?
''Say, ''''Meet Radha''
''My Radha''
He's your best friend. He must be
the first to know of our marriage
He should be the last to know.
''ln fact, he shouldn't know at all''
''Who knows what dreams, what desires''
he comes with ?
What dreams ?
What desires ?
Dreams about you
Now my mother will never
go to meet yours
Why not ?
''Why not, l ask you?''
- What would Sunder think ?
What about what l think ?
What will my parents think ?
Sunder is my dearest friend
And l am to be sacrificed for
''your friendship... my life, my love''
''First, l am sacrificing''
my own love and my happiness
''And next, l shall ask for yours''
l won't sacrifice myself !
l won't! Do you hear me ?
Go away ! Go away from here !
May The Lord preserve you !
We received your wire today
lsn't Gopal here ? Where is he ?
Mr Magistrate ! How are you ?
''How are you, Sunder ?''
- See for yourself. All in one piece
l'm not an easy man to break.
- You've come at the right time
We were so upset.
And look at you now
Stand straight.
- What're you doing ?
l'm casting away the evil eye
Do it to Gopal instead. l'm tough.
l'd come back even from death
To meet Gopal.
- Death to your enemies
What are you doing with the papers ?
Here's a man back from the dead.
You can't have bigger news
And the dead man is sitting
right in front of you
Come off it
You're still the same
ebullient self
'' But you've changed, Gopal.''
- What do you mean ?
You aren't the Gopal l knew. You don't
even seem happy at that l've returned
l thought you'd go wild with joy
What a thing to say ? How can l not
be happy to have you back ?
Maybe l'm just too old to
break out into a jig
''Tell me, how's Radha ?''
She's well. Very well
''Look, l still get the gooseflesh''
when l even think of Radha
''And my heart says, when she sings,''
let me play on
Come Gopal. Let's go to Radha's place
There can be no hurdle now.
l've become worthy
Why not? She's been waiting for you
See her... ?
- l've things to do
You haven't yet done the most
important thing in life !
What's that ?
''- Falling in love, you fool''
l've been away for two years.
And what've you done in two years ?
Couldn't you even
find yourself a Radha ?
Shame on you
Yes. The good-for-nothing oaf. Sunder
''Janki, look who's here''
- Who is it ?
Sunder ! My son !
''Radha, look who's come home''
Sit down
l cried so much for you
We got terrible news
''How are you, Sunder ?''
l promised l'd return.
See? l'm back
All in one piece
Why is everyone standing ?
Sit down
l'll get some drinks
''Excuse me for a moment, please''
''l want to see, to feel, the one''
thing that didn't let me die
We had heard...
- And it was true
Death was certain
My plane turned into a fireball.
l don't even know where l fell
For 2 years l was neither
dead nor alive
Dead...?
- Yes. Head injury. l lost my memory
l couldn't remember a thing
l was moved from one hospital
to another
Do you know the first word l spoke
when l came around?
''Your name Radha, your name''
Only your name stood between
me and my death
A drowning man will clutch at
anything. l clung on to your name
''When l was sinking, drowning''
in the dark abyss of death...
l clung to your name...
your memories
Do you know what saved me ?
What ?
- Your letter
My letter ? But l didn't ...
- Have you forgotten ?
You gave me the letter and
you asked me to post it
l read the letter
over and over again
l usually keep my wallet inside
my right pocket
But your letter was in the wallet.
So l kept in in my left pocket...
close to my heart. lt's as if
my death bounced off your letter
'' Believe me Radha, l've crossed''
the river of no return...
to come back to you.
