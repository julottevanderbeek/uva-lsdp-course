JACK
AND MECHANICAL HEART
If I could, I would keep here in my belly,
hidden forever.
# They say I was born
the world's coldest day. #
# They say I was born with a frozen heart. #
# Even it can be said, that led me
Belly force ... #
# Top of the hill,
overlooking the city ... #
# And its bell tower. #
# There, living in a strange house ... #
# A midwife, all
considered crazy. #
Holds a dead bird in the hair.
There is another bird in this cage, right?
Do not worry, I'll take care of it.
Want something hot?
? Tea, coffee, whiskey?
You have to eat something. I made crepes.
The best of all time!
You can not give birth
on an empty stomach.
Ah, your heart is very hard.
- Your heart is frozen.
- Cute, you mean?
No, ice cream, like ice cream.
That is more robust,
have a good heart with this watch.
It will combine well with your head
Bird feet long.
Alcohol
With a bit of mint and chocolate,
is of course better.
William, the window, please.
Listen, my child.
Not to be back to a
Ice Cube forever ...
have to follow three rules.
# First, do not touch your hands. #
# Second,
you have to control your anger. #
# And above all never forget,
whatever happens ... #
# You never have
to fall in love. #
# Sino forever
the clock of your heart ... #
# The big hour hand,
will pass through your skin ... #
# Watch it explode
and your bones will suffer implosion. #
Mechanical heart # ... #
# Will be broken again. #
No, my ice cube
I'm not your mother.
Although I would.
It looks like a large snowflake
with needles protruding.
So it will be very easy to find
if there is a snowstorm.
I am sure she will be
much better mother than me.
Come on, come on!
! The ground floor of the mountain!
The Great Escape
the catacombs of heaven!
Today, no honey.
I have a lot of work, you know?
Again Arthur went to walk under
rain. His column is all rusty.
Oh, no! Today is my birthday.
You promised.
Have you cleaned your teeth?
You gave rope at your watch?
Yes, I cleaned my clock
rope and gave him my teeth.
Ten years ago
I'm stuck here.
Listen to me.
Just finished with Anna and Luna,
I take. I will fulfill my promise.
Every year it's the same.
I always spend after work.
But look! Anna and Luna again believe
storks. What can we do?
Where's storks?
Can you stay with Arthur,
while the oil permeates his column?
And please, do not make that face
embalmed bird!
Go! Everything happens in life. It can be
cure all, even if it takes time.
Look at me.
I got kicked out of my job ...
and when I told my wife,
she also gave me.
- Why do you have all these eggs?
- Because they are full of memories.
- My wife's cooking as well.
- You Achieve cook like her?
No. And when I prepare them myself,
I seem to be back with her.
Take one if you want.
It is your birthday.
- I will not take away a souvenir.
- Do not worry, I have too.
Someday, I will like to open your bag and
find a good childhood memory.
Thank you.
Come on, Christopher Columbus.
Ready for discovery?
I'm going to wear!
Come on!
Wait a while.
Already dress.
We will go but first I have to
tell you something very important.
I wanted your heart is
stronger before I let you go outside.
- Every beat of your heart is a little miracle.
This thing is fragile. - I know.
- There are three rules you must not forget.
- "Do not touch my needles," I know.
- Yes, but ...
- "Controlling my anger."
And there is a third that will never commented.
It is the most important.
You should never,
never ever ...
fall in love. That is why I am so afraid
to take you into town.
Anything else??
Would die soon. You can not hold
emotional and physical burden of love.
I know. My heart is like a toy
but do not play with it.
- I'm not kidding, Jack.
- But how can I fall in love?
Not know what love is.
Look, there!
Slower.
- Look!
- Jack, calm down!
Is he my father?
No, it's not your father.
Wait!
- A cloud to eat it!
- Are you talking about me?
No, what you're eating.
What is this cute ...?
Does that sound there?
It is an organ of Barbary,
it's cute, right?
It works a bit like your heart.
Must be why I like it so much.
It is mechanical, with emotions inside.
Excuse me to come that way,
but can you give me the time?
- Son 18hrs, gentleman..
- The 18hrs!
The 18h01!Oh, no!
I knew it, I knew it!
She does not come.
Poor guy.
Wait, I have what you need.
Permission, I can?
Did you know that men cry
much better than women?
- No.
- Yes, with larger tears twice.
Jack? Jack?
Jack!
# I lost my glasses ... #
# Rather, I did not want them,
rarely do I see ... #
# With a face of calls ...
lenses. #
# Little phosphorus
is dangerous to be flirty ... #
# And do what you fancy,
You could even burn your eyes. #
# I do not care blurry ... #
# Do not need glasses,
to kiss and sing ... #
# I prefer to keep my eyes closed. #
# Oh, my little fire,
let me nibble your clothes ... #
# Crumble wanting
and spit it out like confetti ... #
# To kiss under a rain ... #
# Did confetti? #
# Yes, we will. #
# I see pure fire.
In a few steps ... #
# I can get lost in the distance,
so far in my street. #
# Now I dare not look at the sun ... #
# Or look at the sky,
right in the eye. #
# I see pure fire. #
# I will guide you out of your head. #
# I'll be your prescription,
you will be my match. #
# I have a confession to make ... #
# I understand but never
I can recognize ... #
# Even if you were sitting
between two old. #
# We will rub,
my being against yours ... #
# Until burn our skeletons
and watch my heart ... #
# At midnight on the dot,
we will burn ... #
# Without even opening his eyes. #
# I see pure fire.
In a few steps ... #
# I can get lost in the distance,
so far in my street. #
# Now I dare not look at the sun ... #
# Or look at the sky,
right in the eye. #
# I see pure fire. #
Do you transform followed
Italian ice cream?
Only when I eat spaghetti
after midnight.
- What is this little sound?
- Nothing. P. .. rain.
- Do you like it?
- Rain, no. But their sound, yes.
- What's that sound, what was it?
- Lightning.
Jack!
No, why not!
What did you do?
You could be dead.The third rule!
Have you forgotten?
Do you hurt the gears when you cough?
It is a ridiculous suffering
next to it can cause love.
More love stronger, more intense the pain.
Know what is surprising.
Cravings of jealousy, misunderstanding,
rejection, injustice ...
The mechanics of your heart will explode!
I like that watch transplanted,
Know your limits very well.
a kiss, even mild,
You can destroy you ...
straight, clack!,
six feet under.
You know why I saved your life?
You are the son I could ever have.
- How can that be?
- It is.
Sometimes nature is capricious,
you know it, right?
I cried a lot before.
But eventually, I got used.
Then arrived. As a godsend,
a consolation prize.
Think you can lose
fills me with sadness.
Is that why you started
tears to drink alcohol?
Yes, among other reasons.
How are you?Neither had time
to celebrate your birthday yesterday!
You seemed glued to the "ground floor
Mountain, "as you say.
Y. ..?? How about that great trip
in the city center?
I work down.
I leave.
- Y. ..?
- It was fa-bu-lo-so!
What did you see it so great?
A singer with glasses,
you never want to put them on.
- What does this mean?
- It's wonderful! P. .. like a bird!
In equilibrium in their tacos.
Have something fragile and strong at the same time.
Looks like a twig.
And when he sings, is equal
a bird, but with words.
And his nose!
Perfectly drawn.
So girl I do not know
how you can breathe it.
I think it's just for show.
It's too much girl!
So not wearing his glasses.
And with the slightest cold,
must snoring like a locomotive!
No, a nose and can only
produce a flute.
- You're not up to something, you?
- Yes, you.
- You know you are being banned.
- Pro-hi-bi-do!
- I know. - It's a bad for a good, you know?
If I could do without the love ...
We know what we mean.
Do you know?? I fall in love every time
that I have a regular patient.
And every time, they end up bored.
How about those flowers?
The chose to.
Some went shopping
the cemetery ...
The take on the grave of a dead
very rich and very dear.
- Nor was his burial place.
- Just cleaned it. Nothing more.
Now it looks better, thanks to us.
Neither looked his name, poor thing!
Not so "poor".
- And I brought a little surprise.
- For real?
Thank you.
- Where did you find this skirt, Luna?
- Do not like?
For in the cemetery,
As flowers.
It is a relic of my adolescence.
The modernized a bit.
It was the uniform that had
to carry on Calton Hill School.
- Does the school?
- I was a little girl well then.
Madeleine, eh ...
I thought well in the three rules.
- That makes me happy.
- Good.
- And I think I found the solution.
- "The solution"?
I have to go to school. To ... eh ...
learn and understand the rules.
And apply them in real life.
Do not want to start studying
with your Board, here?
To work seriously,
I have to go to school.
What school?
You'll be bored there.
- Not at all.
- Of course I'll be bored!
You'll have to read books that are not going to
like here when you choose what you want.
You'll have to just sit
many hours without moving.
You can not talk or make noise ...
Even to dream,
have to wait for recess!
I know you,
You're going to hate that.
Everyone will make fun of you, with your watch.
You'll be treated like a monster.
All the world's children go to school.
You always have a job.
I feel lonely. be discovered
the world now, do you understand?
"Discovering the World" ... at school!
Well, I think there is a portfolio
school in the attic. Go for it.
Oh, Madeleine, is the best gift
World's Birthday!
Hi there. Do you know a little girl singer
that hits everywhere?
Hello there!
Have you seen a cant ...?
# Now go several years that I'm
as at home in this school. #
# It is true that in the playground,
often I am the law. #
# All students respect me.
Surely many fear me. #
# I have my brands, my habits,
my certainties that kingdom. #
# It's true, I do not like change.
For me, life is stability. #
# I want to delete everything you can
threaten my authority. #
Hi there.
# Long time do you need
and I have no more rivals around. #
# But at school, I do not like,
recently got a new guy. #
- Looking for something?
- Yes, a singer. Tiny.
What do you want that little singer?
A few days ago, I saw her singing and banging
everywhere. I want to give her ...
A pair of glasses!
It's called ...
called Miss Acacia.
- Miss Acacia ...
- And no one can talk about it ...
not even pronounce his name.
Except me!
- But ... eh ...
- No one! Did you hear? You got that midget?
Forget.
How do you make that ticking sound?
Is your heart that makes so much noise?
Yes.
- Do not tell me you
you fell for it? - A little.
Too bad for you. He is no longer here.
Sure has left town.
I can not even hear you thinking, or destruction
the clock to serve you heart!
I'll break so strong,
you never can love!
# Here you are, with a cat face ... #
# Funambuleando ceilings ... #
# With the moon as a watchman. #
Y.? .. How was school?
Hey! Vi move to a goblin with portfolio
came to school and did not kiss me.
Next time, it's your heart
I break your skull!
Come see "Big Ben"
haganlo and operated.
Come in.
One by one.
# Where I go,
there is a gate called "Joe". #
# I have to find a key
to free. #
That was my best customer.
So good, that he died doing ...
A champion rodeo was believed this.
Now, enough.
We're going to have some fun today.
In my country, you'd be an adult.
Arthur, Anna, Madeleine, to celebrate!
Come on!To have some fun! Yup??
Arthur!
# Happy Birthday ... #
# We wish you ... #
Happy birthday, Joe. #
# Happy Birthday. #
Happy Birthday. Miss Acacia.
J. .. Edinburgh, Scotland.
- Give me that postcard soon!
- No, it's my birthday, for me!
"Happy Birthday" with signature
Miss Acacia.It's for me!
Today is my birthday.
You're late, Big Ben!
- Did you do well in school today?
- No.
What happened?
You went back to see the singer?
I killed Joe.
I killed her eye with the cuckoo.
Madeleine, police
are going up the hill.
I have to go.
Come and get me through the eye of Joe.
Anna, Luna, with Jack to the station.
You have to leave the city urgent.
- We take care.
- I'm staying for the police.
I prepare some things
and go out the back.
- What will you say? - Do not come back
In a few days I'll tell you disappeared.
Over time, you will be considered dead
Arthur and help me dig your grave.
- What will the coffin? - Nothing
Coffin, only an epitaph on the tree.
The police will not check. It is the advantage
be considered a witch.
They will not pry into my grave.
Watch your key, Jack.
And do not forget, just get settled,
go see a watchmaker.
- You mean: a doctor?
- Not at all!
Never consult a doctor
by a heart problem.
You'll have to find a watchmaker.
You're going to hurt the clock
If we tighten too strong.
You have to go now.
I do not want to get caught.
We will.
It is time to leave.
I still have not gone,
but since I have cold.
# Now, I played like a bell ... #
# Abandoned in a desert of blue smoke. #
# As the fear go, go,
and the vicissitudes of the twists and turns ... #
# Cause me problems. #
# That I will learn to avoid other
opportunity, but now see ... #
# Popcorn that I have
in the heart begin to explode. #
# Is mechanical panic of my heart. #
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #
# Poor me without you
if you do not you wait in the station. #
# My heart is heavy,
not float or in the peaceful ocean. #
# It will pique
Itchy a heart, I know ... #
# Is not very rich in love. #
# Come mists. Drop your
delighted trains at that hour ... #
# I can make them
Ghosts of sublime women. #
# Blondes or brunettes,
cut directly into the fog. #
# I destriparlas,
without even shoo ... #
# And signed: "your humble servant,
Jack ... The Ripper. "#
# Do not be afraid, little one! #
# You will learn quick scare
to exist. #
# Do not be afraid, little one!
You will learn fast to scare ... #
# Is mechanical panic of my heart. #
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #
# Mechanical panic of my heart. #
# Loco, loco, locomotive,
steam locomotive. #
Damn machine that does not work!
Excuse my behavior,
my friend ...
but it is extremely important to me,
jump-start my invention.
And as you see, is disarmed
very easily. Do you understand?
Yes, I think I understand.
What is this thing?
What a lovely volcanic mechanics has here.
I need a watchmaker to repair me.
Do you know any?
I'm not a watchmaker, but I'm a handyman
I would try and fix this.
Would you like to scale
in my small workshop in Paris ...
to fix?
It's extraordinary!
That Dr. Madeleine is a genius.
The way you set this up ...
It is full of love,
even in the smallest detail.
That's my problem, love.
It is very dangerous for me, says Madeleine.
- Is very damaged?
- No, everything works fine.
And it gives me an idea for my camera.
If I put the same piece on the reel ...
I put on the pulleys
Timing of your arteries ...
I think that making machine dreams
should work again!
Exactly like yours,
my friend.
- Lord ...
- Call me Georges, Georges Méliès!
Mr. Méliès,
I met a little singer ...
Well, they are things that happen.
Yes, but when I saw her, I felt
like an earthquake in my watch.
The gears creaking,
the ticking accelerated ...
I began to suffocate, to confuse,
to entangle my needles!
- Do you like it?
- I loved it.
- So what?
- I fear that Madeleine was right.
That love is killing me.
If you're afraid to hurt you,
you increase the likelihood of harm you!
Watch the tightrope walkers. Do you think
to fall when walking on the wire?
Do not!They enjoy risk
to face danger!
If you spend your life not break fijándote
nothing, you'll be bored a lot, believe me!
Want to live the great adventure
with that girl?
If I ever find it.
I think it is in Granada.
There is nothing more fun
that recklessness!
If at age 14 you decide to go
Return to Europe to see a girl ...
is that you have the gene for recklessness
well developed, right?
See, it works.The machine works
exactly as your heart!
Como vac feelings ..!
You could make a movie about ...
the mechanics of your heart, now that
I know all their gear.
Why not??
It would be nice.
Do you know?? When I was in love,
tucos kept inventing.
Cheats, tips and tricks always,
to amuse my girlfriend.
I think eventually
she got bored with my tricks.
Look, one day,
I took two tablets of their shelves ...
casters and added them I recovered
in a shopping hospital.
And we both slipped under the moon.
He never wanted to get on top.
And I had to repair the shelves.
It is not always easy to love, my friend.
Then come with me to Andalusia
Mr. Méliès.Anything can happen there!
Would you accept a conjurer
the brink of depression ...
as partner
for your loving pilgrimage?
I love to travel with a magician,
Even depressed!
That's me! Let me put some
tricks in my bag, and go!
# I'm just a human trick
who wants to become a man. #
# No trick,
at my age, it would be perfect ... #
# Not be considered as a man ... #
# Uno real big
a human being my age. #
# A human without fakery. #
# I'm just a human trick
who wants to become a man. #
# No trick,
at my age, it would be perfect ... #
# Not be considered as a man ... #
# Uno real big
a man my age. #
I think we've arrived.
What do you think?
It is different from Edinburgh.
My head is spinning!
Extraordinary!
Come, see a man
laying eggs ...
Looking for a job, shorty?
I needed to espantador.
No, I'm looking for a tiny, extraordinary
flamenco singer.
You here??It's like looking for a snowflake
snow in a sandstorm!
She has ankles chick
and often bump into things.
And for me, I give a fuck your singer!
You want the job or not?
says he can catch,
only to light a night without stars.
Ladies and gentlemen, before long,
on the bandstand ...
- Miss Acacia?
- Now, do you mind?
I'll think.
Mr. Méliès!
Mr. Méliès!
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a short time ...
You have to act like a poker player.
Never show or your fear or your questions.
Have a master card
in your game: the heart!
Well, do not play as Valet, act
as King and you have to Lady.
- Yes, but I can not play cards.
- You're different, Jack ...
and think it's a weakness.
But it's the opposite!
Your difference is your strength!
This fragility, that clock-heart ...
make you special
and so lovely.
- Accept your difference!
- Does my disability as a weapon of seduction?
- Do you really believe?
- Of course!
Does your little singer
not seduced you ...
with his way of hitting
everywhere?
Maybe.
The door to his dressing room is
open and no one.Run!
to a light kiss can destroy you.
I'm not kidding, Jack.
# I lost my glasses,
rather I did not wear them ... #
# Make me look weird,
with a side flame ... #
What do you do here?
height of seduction
is that she has the illusion ...
Hey!
I leaned against the door
and ended on the sofa.
Does it happen often end up in the dressing room
a girl who is going to change?
- No, not often.
- So where usually ends?
- Directly under the bed or does the shower?
- I'm sorry.
Have we not met before?
I seem to recognize.
- Recognize me?
- Well, what do you want from me?
I want to get her something.
- What?
- A bunch of lenses!
They are my favorite flowers.
I never wear my glasses.
In my head, I look like a fly.
To me, that's fine.
Can we meet again?
With or without glasses.
Maybe.
- You're not from here, right?
- Yeah, no, I work on the Ghost Train.
Very well. So,
You're the new espantador?
Right. The new espantripador,
It's me!
- Can I come to see you perform?
- Of course, where?
- Well, on the Ghost Train!
- Yes, of course.
- Tomorrow? How 16hrs.?
- May.
Y.? .. How did it go?
Excellent!
I said maybe!
- Georges, you want to stay
coffee? - How about some tea?
Both!
Is the position still vacant?
- Whenever you go running to think?
- Yes, and I thought long and ...
I would love to have the job!
What can you do to scare?
We will not make millions
with this, but ...
I have no one and at least you,
trains will leave on time.
You can count on me for that.
Stay in your place, scares people
and all will be well. Do you understand?
- All right, lady.
- Miss.
- Good Morning!
- You scared me.
- I have a sensitive heart.
- Me too.
# When working on the Ghost Train ... #
# I met this older girl,
called "Brigitte Heim". #
# I'm the boss ... Ghost Train #
# And ground tombs steal skulls ... #
# To make cute decorations,
on the Ghost Train. #
# Elle was awful
the Ghost Train ... #
# And wanted me shooing people,
Poor me! #
# "If you walk through the skulls ... #
# And break something,
You pay! "#
# But I was king of the Ghost Train ... #
# Because everyone wanted
see my heart bleed. #
# He was the king of the Ghost Train ... #
# Until the day the little girl on fire
came to visit. #
# I do not mind the awful lady
with full house vacuum. #
# I do not mind the awful lady
with full house vacuum. #
# Because the little girl on fire
dream ... #
# Sleeping in my arms now! #
# Now in my arms! #
# Now in my arms! #
# Now in my arms!
I'm the King of the Ghost Train. #
# You are alone with your pretty skull
What a cute ornament ... #
# For the Ghost Train! #
# "If you give me headache,
Pay! "#
# "If you do not frighten people,
Pay! "#
# Pay, pay, pay,
always pay! #
# Pay, pay, pay!
Always pay ... #
# Your ghost mouth
smoky. #
Not freaked anyone. Terrible.
I have a reputation to maintain.
Ah, yes. To me it gave me much fright.
Of course,
She does not see anything!
It was very good. I saw nothing,
but it looked fun. Congratulations.
- Thank you. Did you try the glasses?
- Yes, but they are bent or broken.
The purposely chose well, for you to use
without fear of damaging them.
I have this strange feeling ...
as we had already
lived or dreamed this time.
- Oh yeah?
- I really think I know you.
- Can we dance?
- So, in silence?
Yes, we have no problem of pace.
Right.
- What is that little sound?
- Rain. Do you like it??
Rain, no.
But their sound, yes.
And I heard it somewhere.
- It's my heart.
- Your what?
My heart.
I produced it the day I was born.
They say he was born on the coldest day of the world
and my heart froze.
It is full of Arreglito
but it works.
Want to try?
There is to wind.
And here, to open.
Do you do all the girls that come to you
to see that the wooden heart?
- No, it's the first time.
- So, thank you.
You're welcome.
No, I can not.
Yes I am a magnet that grows
in my belly and draws me to you, but ...
I'm in love with another
and long.
Yesterday, when I saw my dressing room,
you remind me a little.
And I confess that I liked.
But ...
start a new adventure
you would be dishonest.
I can not, sorry.
- So ...?
- She's in love with another.
I went through half of Europe for her,
For nothing!
- Did you tell her you loved her, too?
- For what? His heart is full.
A heart does not empty
as a sink.
- You recognized, at least?
- No.
But I prefer not to recognize me,
to another without loving me.
She is like a spark.
How to tame a spark?
Sparks is not tame, my friend!
They are like stars ...
are always fleeting.
I was never so sad ...
and so happy at the same time.
Two incredible feelings by only one,
're lucky, small.
If only she believed in my heart.
He thinks it's an accessory, do you realize?
Girls are like wild animals as well,
freedom gives them their beauty.
Do not try to tame it, because,
even if Miss Acacia loves you someday ...
You can never control something.
Tell me. Least
You know who loves her?
- I just want to know ...
- What are you doing back here?
- Do I know you?
- To whom?
The boy who you're ... in love.
- No.
- "No", you're not in love?
No, you do not.
Long time ago I have not seen.
It was in Edinburgh.
That giant city her so well.
The tops of the towers
acute in the twilight ...
it was a little scary, but it seemed
reassuring with its strange shape.
To do this with your watch!
Besides, it's dangerous!
It will end hurting someone.
You could take it off occasionally.
But I can not!
It is not an accessory, it's my heart!
I am sorry.
Look, I would much
that we might really friends.
Tomorrow, we may be on the stand
of extraordinary stories.
They say there's a new thing for
storytelling. They call it "film."
I'd love to go with you.
Maybe.
Ladies and gentlemen,
and above all, ladies ...
Today, you will see the great number
Pink witchcraft in the world ...
even more than in the world,
In the galaxy!
You see, for years I
sewing dreams to reality ...
to form a single tissue of lies.
How exciting!
I started by sticking photographs
but I missed the most important ...
! movement!
Film art is shamanic!
You can straighten shadows ...
You summon,
Everything becomes possible!
Soon we will relive
the dead with this tool!
! It is the best remedy

Ladies, ladies and ladies!
You will see the first movie

So, I must thank the man
that burned in me the last spark ...
to jump-start the machine
moving images.
I present to my left:
Jack, the man-watch!
Fifty kilos of bones
and crisp gear ...
covered by a thin
sweet skin and freckles ...
More succulent than the other one!
And a heart, ladies and ladies
Big as a watch!
In fact, I was trying to fix it
moving their gear ...
finally,
I understood how to end my invention!
Now what have good projection.
is love.
Congratulations!
- It was cute, huh?
- Oh, yes, very nice.
- You, you cried.
- Not at all.
- I know your Romeo.
- Do not start again!
This guy is bad. He has done everything.
I brutalized, left me a fool ...
humbled me, every day,
Against all!
It? If I had never done

Maybe not a fly,
but to me, yeah.
- Why did not you defend yourself?
- It was much bigger and stronger than me.
Do not! You must be wrong,
I measured him as no more.
Much more!
I only saw him once but
I remember like it was yesterday.
I think of this memory every day
and every night to sleep.
- Are you jealous?
- Not at all. Not the problem.
I saw only without glasses
because he was singing.
Not know if you recognize the view,
but ...
I'm sure it's not the
monster which you speak.
- How did you meet?
- That day, it was raining in Edinburgh.
The sound of rain is my music
preferred since.
It was just before
denounce my parents.
- Can you stop doing this?
- What?
- That thing.
- No, I do not think.
- No matter continue.
- I heard a voice and sang with me.
Bailamos ...
rather, we hit and ...
as we were in a bubble.
Sorry, should save the details.
No, no, continue.
On the contrary, do me good.
I do not know how he did it
but almost tore my dress.
- Do not!
- Yes, and I stepped on my glasses.
- Do not tell me.
- Had that indescribable feeling ...
like everything could happen.
I was confident it was fine.
So good!
I have ...
I have something to ...
I have something to tell you!
- You wanted to tell me something?
- Yes, yes ... I ...
- Then give.
- I would like ...
- See you again tomorrow.
- Okay. Where?
Eh ... do not know ... uh ...

He is in love with me.
There it is, ladies and ladies:
Jack, the tamer of sparks!
Yes, but there is a problem.
He is in love with another ...
Edinburgh him.
That's not a problem.
The "other you" is you like.
Now you can connect to both:
Dream and reality!
- But I know not how to tell.
- Please! "I, Jack, Edinburgh ...
"I traveled half of Europe
for you, my love ...
"And now, I want to climb to heaven
hand with you. "
Never make it. I tried but
the words are in my throat.
He still afraid to explode
your heart, right?
Yes, I think Madeleine
and their efforts to keep it alive.
Do not be afraid.
I thought you wanted to live, to be loved.
"To be considered a man,
one true, great, a human being ...
your age, without a human trick. "
I had to have told him who I was before.
You have to help me with a trick.
One trick I do not know.
But an idea can be.
Jack?
Jack?
- This way, miss.
- Yeah, over here!
Stay there.
Do not move.
We are in Edinburgh,
the April 16, 1884.
A typically British rain
moistens the city center.
# Dance like a bird, in balance
on their little tacos ... #
# Your feet start to tangle,
her cute nose to collapse comes ... #
# Against the pavement. #
# I'm beating my head against
trees and blue leaves ... #
# That seem to be stuck in Heaven. #
- What is that little sound?
- It is true, what is it?
It is raining.
Do you like it??
A Miss Acacia, loved the rain
but ...
still did not know that they were actually
Man beats his life.
If that day, I would have said
whence came the sound of rain ...
when the same Jack
toured half of Europe ...
such a Don Quixote with wheels,
to conquer the impossible dream ...
she would have recognized,
even without glasses ...
for trusting your heart
and finally ...
could experience the unique magic
and intimate, it is to mix the dream ...
with reality.
But go!
What are you doing here?
Eh ... I'm rehearsing kiss,
while you sleep.
If you're the guy from my dream
Edinburgh ...
Why do not you tell me then?
- Fear not you remembered.
- I can hardly believe it.
Also, my mother always told me
rely only on what he saw.
Well, put your lenses.
To my parents, so deceived,
and I never saw them again.
So I had to run away from Edinburgh.
They trusted.
Too bad.
lived clandestinely in Scotland.
Neither I nor my mother had documents.
One day, a neighbor promised
I was going to get us some.
And the next day,
It came with two policemen.
I stayed so long in the snow
my feet froze.
My eyes also froze
in parts.
not see much before but since
that time, even with glasses ...
That key gives wind my watch.
Without it, I'd sleep forever.
You can open, winding,
Do whatever you want.
- Do not I hurt you, there?
- Not exactly.
- Is this normal?
- Yes, it's okay, just ...
long ago
I'm in love with you.
Trust me.
Follow.
# You are the key
I fully opens. #
* You can visit my body. #
# From the inside,
squeeze my heart ... #
# To make me mourn. #
# Even your tongue sometimes shines. #
# Oh, flag!, I flagger.
I came back to strike. #
Miss # key. #
# Miss key! #
# I know where to tighten
make you laugh, even frying. #
# Put birds around your bones ... #
# To give you the feeling of flying! #
# Fly and fly,
sound your tacos. #
# I would stop time
to last ... #
# A little more. #
For a while I'm like,
Dwarf!Do not you! What do you do with it?
Waste of time.
All are waiting at the kiosk.
You go on stage in 5 minutes!
Here, I have to go.
- No, keep it. - But is the key
your heart, Jack. It's yours.
No, now it's yours.
Let's go??
- How do you mean?
- Both. After your concert ...
them up like lightning.
- You mean "like horses"?
- Exactly, yes.
- To go where?
- I do not know, but I'd like to say yes.
Watch out!
If parts of my skull, the pay.
I do that labor.
And what will you do now
old assembly?
Will you serve in a decorative clock ...
or a cemetery?
The cemetery is a good idea.
Also, since I have a grave.
Get out of here!
- Y. ..?
- Yes, what happened?
- Love the real me.
- Congratulations, young man!
I'm happy for you both.
The way to look after the concert,
and we sneaked us into English.
- You mean, "the French"?
- Yes, well, "the French".
Thank you very much for everything.
I would never have done it without you.
- We will miss you.
- Feedback from time to time.
Jack?
Your watch is fast.
Joe?
What are you doing here?
I always dreamed of knowing Andalusia
You know?
And as I kept birthday cards
you sent me ...
I thought:
"I'm going to visit me Miss Acacia."
- Hopefully, I will listen sing.
- How kind.
- Would you go again?
- Yes
I went to see my childhood sweetheart:
Jack. We leave tonight.
Are you going with him?
Congratulations.
I did not recognize at first.
At the same time, it's like
if he had always known it was him.
Strange, I, I turn to find
enemy of my youth.
The haunting sound of your heart
night from my school.
Since then, I can not stand
the slightest noise clock.
And it is, I'm ready!
Oh, at that time, that little Jack,
with its air of sad bird ...
I did not realize
how it was dangerous.
What do you mean dangerous?
- Are you sure you've seen that has
a normal heart? - Yes, I noticed.
That thing, shaped clock ...
then, is not a heart, is a Granada,
What a time bomb!
I know what I mean,
I suffered the consequences.
Jack may be a done this.
Not hurt a fly.
Except when you lose control of your heart
and fails to respect the three rules.
What rules?
# First, do not touch your hands. #
# Second,
you have to control your anger. #
# And above all never forget,
whatever happens ... #
# You never have
to fall in love. #
You could have become
a killer!
- What are you talking about?
- Joe told me everything!
I know all three rules,
busted eye, everything!
- Joe?
- Yes, I do not lie more.
- Joe is here?
- How could you hide things so serious?
Who are you?
Who I am, or rather
was it love?
I could have killed you.
No I love you more.
Would you have turned into a killer.
This is not love.
Selfish!
- But it is not so!
- Did not you popped his eye?
Yes, but it was an accident.
I never wanted to get that but ...
He did not tell me you did
endure for years!
- Deserved to reventaras an eye?
- No, of course but ...
Why do you think I told you
and came here for that?
- Try to get away from you!
- Try to protect you.
It has never protected anyone!
Sowed terror in school!
And continues to do so today, look how
we are acting because of him!
- More over, you're angry.
- Listen to me.
Do not touch me.
For this!
- You scare me.
- I ... I'm sorry.
- It's raining.
- Let me now.
I have a strange way of loving
weird but my heart ...
I really love you.
It is true, Madeleine
I fall in love ... banned
no clutch, I put my life in your hands.
Because since I saw you sing
and we crashed ...
I think only see you again.
I can face it all for you.
I can do anything for you.
With this, I agree!
You do anything!
Yes I know. I do everything backwards.
It makes me angry.
Well, I'd rather be with rabies
until you're dead.
Now go.
Go, please.
# Years and years of thinking,
in brooding ... #
# But it is impossible to accept
that relationship is over. #
# Miss Acacia haunts my mind,
please do. #
# I'm going to meet her
and with it he busted my eye. #
# So I'm back
and I come to change history. #
# I will not stay in Edinburgh,
rotting in despair. #
# It is not enough to see it
only in my dreams. #
# I came to retrieve it.
If I try, I die. #
# I'll also see my worst enemy,
that dwarf, that "Little Jack". #
# And approaching him,
then I heard the famous tic-tac. #
# I looked at my one eye
and increase the tension felt. #
# I saw hatred in the eyes of Jack,
we had to talk. #
# I told him it was not the same
to be one-eyed and had changed me. #
# I too have suffered for being different
and did not come to revenge. #
# What mistreated in the past and he blew me
the eye. I think we're on par. #
# If back is only for one thing:
Miss Acacia has to stop. #
# Jack understand that hate me,
for years I was the cause of their misfortunes. #
# The humiliated, chased him,
I made all the pain. #
# But it was his fault. The first day
class, I had the bad idea ... #
# Talk to me Miss Acacia,
that was his death sentence. #
# We have a common point,
both would do anything for her. #
# We are adults, so far,
no fights child. #
# I want to head back to Edinburgh
up, along with Miss Acacia. #
# Now, I propose a duel Jack
fair and the best man win. #
You lost yourself,
I did not have to do anything.
I thought I would address
a tougher opponent.
I really do not deserve it.
Back when I went to see her,
immediately snuggled in my arms.
- I hate you!
- No, Jack!
Do not!
Stop, no!
Do not stay here
is in crisis.
- Broken is whole.
- Broken is whole.
I want to change the heart.
Modifícame, I beg you.
I'm sick that screwed all the time.
Madeleine was right.
I have some spare parts for my
camera, but I can try to fix ...
I'm sick to remake me,
I want something solid, something new!
Your problem seems to me to be more
deeper than the wood of your watch.
I want you to install a new heart
and start again from scratch.
Do not ever want to fall in love.
I understand, my friend,
need time, nothing more.
But I no longer remains,
I gave my key to Miss Acacia.
Do you give the key to your heart
and a spark?
- Where is he now?
- He's gone. With Joe.
That key was your life!
You knew the risks!
- I know. - You have to go back
to see quick Madeleine.
Only she can save.
When did you last rope?
- I do not know.
- Have to hurry.
Better stay here.
He knew the risks as you said.
I have to bear them alone.
In addition ...
you're having success with
your "Journey to the Moon."
One love "two for one"
It is a formula that suits you.
- Courage, my friend, value.
- It is the value that I need.
Do you think Jack will be fine?
You think back to Edinburgh?
His whole family is there.
I do not know, but if you decide to return ...
is to find
a very bad surprise.
Why?
Just after the departure of Jack, that witch
Madeleine ended up in jail.
I was not ...
I'm sorry,
a front wheel is broken.
- I was not what?
- Not very happy to be in jail.
But he did not stay there long,
died a few days later.
They say he died of sadness
because of Jack.
You mean:
because of the way Jack.
Yes, that should be. That guy planting
misfortune wherever I go.
What is it??
Jack had given me his key before
leaving, I have to go back there!
Excuse me.
Do you know where is Jack?
Eh ... returned to Edinburgh.
It is what I feared.
I have his key.
Do not worry. That Dr. Madeleine
you saved the day he was born ...
know how to fix it,
even if everything comes unarmed.
Is she dead!
What? You have to catch up fast,
Save it!
That's all he wants,
Salves you what!
It's in a car for Valencia. with
Hopefully, you'll get before you board the train.
Wait, just a second!
It is the diary that I am writing ...
since I met Jack. have something
to read for that long trip.
Thank you.
I, at his age,
except for rowing and magic ...
... But he's like your dreams
they stayed too long ...
in wooden crate
that serves as the heart.
That little Miss Acacia
opened that cage.
I've never seen anyone  dream
so strongly with another person.
Not a  that transplanted le-cuckoo clock,
but an electric volcano.

A true  Quixote. when
is dedicated to his dream, is inflexible ...
- Jack!
- Oh, poor thing.
Thank you.
You still look like
a muscular shrimp, eh?
I think Jack caught a bad cold.
quiet,
quiet.
Hello, Arthur.
Rust invades your spine.
Squeaks any movement.
He began to fear the cold
and rain since ...
Where is Madeleine?
Jack, listen.
I'll have to pronounce
heavy words.
So heavy that may remain
stuck in my throat.
- The day you went away ...
- After accompany the train ...
- Anna and I returned here.
- The door was open.
- No one.
- The workshop was broken.
It seemed like a hurricane had passed.
All boxes Madeleine
were open.
Even the cat was gone.
With Arthur, went to look for her.
And finally, we find ...
in the prison of San Calford.
- In jail?
- Yes
The police arrested her after
our departure.
It was not the first time
that the imprisoned.
We thought everything
was going to fix.
- I want to see it now.
- I would tell you ... they released.
- That kitchen with a hand ...
- Make someone other ...
and although you have missed,
she's fine.
But ...
Madeleine is gone.
He left his body in prison.
I know you'll be very sad ...
but never forget that you gave him the
joy of being a real mother!
It was the biggest dream of his life.
For her, you were a small and fragile thing ...
to be protected at all costs ...
linked to it by the cord
clock-shaped.
He feared the day that you would become
an adult.
I stand here. And I advise
do the same, miss.
This site up there,
is happy.
Jack!
Here I am.
Jack?
It's not too late.
I can still save you.
- You just did.
- No, let me.
I have to give you rope.
You came here for me.
It is the most extraordinary thing you can do.
- Thank you.
- Do not!
Now, if something happens to me,
I will be solely responsible.
Now, you can kiss me.
