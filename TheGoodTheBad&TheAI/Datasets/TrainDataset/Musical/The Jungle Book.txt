{y:i}
{y:i}
{y:i}Many strange legends are told...
{y:i}of these jungles of India,
{y:i}but none so strange as the story
{y:i}of a small boy named Mowgli.
{y:i}It all began when the silence
{y:i}of the jungle was broken
{y:i}by an unfamiliar sound.
{y:i}
{y:i}It was a sound like
{y:i}one never heard before...
{y:i}in this part
{y:i}of the jungle.
{y:i}It was a man cub !
{y:i}Had I known how deeply
{y:i}I was to be involved,
{y:i}I would've obeyed
{y:i}my first impulse and walked away.
{y:i}
{y:i}This man cub would have
{y:i}to have nourishment, and soon.
{y:i}It was many days travel
{y:i}to the nearest man-village,
{y:i}and without a mother's care,
{y:i}he would soon perish.
- {y:i}
- {y:i}Then it occurred to me.
{y:i}A family of wolves
{y:i}I knew...
{y:i}had been blessed
{y:i}with a litter of cubs.
{y:i}
{y:i}I knew there'd be no problem with the
{y:i}mother, thanks to the maternal instinct,
{y:i}but I wasn't so sure
{y:i}about Rama, the father.
{y:i}
{y:i}Ten times, the rains
{y:i}had come and gone,
{y:i}and I often stopped by to see how
{y:i}Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
{y:i}He was a favourite with all
{y:i}the young wolf cubs of the pack.
Whoo-whoo-whoooo !
{y:i}Whoo-whoo-whoooo !
-
-
{y:i}No man cub
{y:i}was ever happier.
{y:i}And yet,
{y:i}I knew that someday...
{y:i}he would have to go back
{y:i}to his own kind.
{y:i}
{y:i}Then one night, the wolf pack elders
{y:i}met at Council Rock...
{y:i}because Shere Khan,
{y:i}the tiger,
{y:i}had returned
{y:i}to their part of the jungle.
{y:i}This meeting was to change
{y:i}the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.
{y:i}Now, are we all
{y:i}in agreement...
{y:i}as to what must be done ?
Now it is
my unpleasant duty...
to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.
Yes, Akela ?
{y:i}The council
{y:i}has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.
{y:i}He must leave at once.
"Leave" ?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But--
But the man cub is--
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled
to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength
of the pack is no match for the tiger.
{y:i}But the boy cannot survive
{y:i}alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera ?
How ?
I know of a man-village
where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.
I'm sure
he'll go with me.
So be it.
There's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting
a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we
start back home ?
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.
I'm taking you
to a man-village.
But why ?
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle...
and he has sworn
to kill you.
Kill me ?
But why would he want to do that ?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,
just another hunter
with a gun.
We'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so,
but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I--
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
{y:i}Things will look better
{y:i}in the morning.
Man Cub ?
{y:i}Man Cub !
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
Uh-- I don't wanna go back
to the man-village.
Go on. Up you go.
That limb way up there ?
{y:i}
{y:i}That's right.
{y:i}
{y:i}Is that all the better you can climb ?
It's too big around.
And besides,
I don't have any claws.
- Yeow-ohhh !
-
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay
in the jungle.
Huh ?
You wouldn't last one day.
I'm not afraid.
I-I can look out
for myself.
S-S-S-Say, now.
What have we here ?
It's a man cub.
A delic-i-ous man cub.
Oh, go away
and leave me alone.
Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.
Oh, now, please
go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.
¤ Pleas-s-se
go to sleep ¤
¤ Please go to sleep ¤
{y:i}¤S-S-Sleep
{y:i}little man cub¤
¤ Rest in peace ¤¤
Sleep.
- S-S-S-Sleep.
-
Ba-Ba-Bagheera--
Oh, now-- now, look,
there's no use arguing any more.
Now, no more talk
till morning.
He won't be here
in the morning.
Huh ?
Oh, yes, he will. I--
Kaa !
Hold it, Kaa !
Ohhh !
My sinus-s-s-s-s.
You have just made
a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend,
a very s-s-s-stupid...
N-N-N-Now, Kaa, I was--
mistake.
- Look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you.
- No, please, Kaa--
{y:i}Both eyes,
if you please.
You have just...
s-s-s-sealed your doom.
Ohhhh-- Aaah !
Aaaah ! Ooh !
Look, Bagheera !
{y:i}Look! Bagheera !
{y:i}Wake up, Bagheera !
Wha--
Just you wait...
till I get you in my coils--
Uhhh !
{y:i}
{y:i}Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot
in his tail."
This is going to slow down...
my s-s-s-slithering.
{y:i}
{y:i}
So, you can look out
for yourself, can you ?
So, you want to stay
in the jungle, do you ?
Yes, I wanna stay
in the jungle.
Ohhh !
For the last time,
go to sleep.

{y:i}Man cub. Huh !

- Oooh !

Uh, pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
{y:i}arms!
Stick your nose out.
-  Like this ?
- That's right.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember: in battle,
that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it,
my man.
- Yes, sir.
- {y:i}Very good. Carry on.
-
- {y:i}
- {y:i}Let's have a little more spit
{y:i}and polish on those bayonets.
- Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in
the Maharaja's Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was--
Or, or was it ?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross...
for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty.
Ha-ha !
Those were the days.
Discipline !
Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and all that
sort of thing, you know.
Eh-- Uh-- Oh.
Uh, where was I ?
Oh, yes. Inspection.
{y:i}Well, very good.
{y:i}Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
{y:i}This is the army.
{y:i}
{y:i}Eyes front.
{y:i}Tsk, tsk, tsk. Lieutenant,
{y:i}that haircut is not regulation.
{y:i}Rather on the gaudy side,
{y:i}don't you think ?
{y:i}There. That's better.
{y:i}And as for you--
{y:i}Oh, there you are.
{y:i}Let's keep those heels
{y:i}together, shall we, son ?
Okay, Pop.
- Sir.
- {y:i}Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh ?
- I say, what happened to your trunk ?
- Hey !
- {y:i}Stop that!
-
A man cub ! Ohh, this is treason !
Sabotage !
I'll have no man cub
in my jungle !
- It's not your jungle !
- Hold it ! Hold it !
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi,
if you please, sir.
Ohh, yes, yes.
Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay ?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember,
an elephant never forgets.
I don't know
what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are ?
{y:i}
{y:i}Let's get on with it !
{y:i}Right face!
{y:i}Forward... march !
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something ?
Nonsense,
Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot
our son.
Uh, our s-- Son ?
Son !
{y:i}Oh, yes, yes, yes.
{y:i}Quite right.
{y:i}To the rear... march !

I'm gonna be a colonel just like my--

I've told you a thousand times--
{y:i}- Pop ! Look out!

Ohhh ! Owww !
Ohhh ! Owww ! Oooh !
Gee, Pop, you forgot
to say "halt."
He said an elephant
never forgets.
- {y:i}
- It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.
Bagheera !
Where are we goin' ?
You're going back
to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to
drag you every step of the way.
L-Let go, you--
{y:i}You let go of {y:i}me!
{y:i}
Ohh !
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on,

to fight like a bear.
Come on.
I'm gonna show ya.
Ha-ha !
Yeah !
{y:i}All right, kid,
{y:i}loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.
That's it. Now give me
a big bear growl.
- Scare me.
-
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about
like a {y:i}big bear.
{y:i}
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have
left him alone.

- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that ?
{y:i}
{y:i}
{y:i}You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no !
It's Baloo !
That shiftless,

Weave about now.

Keep movin'. Keep--
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on ! That's it !
He's a dandy !
Fine teacher you are,
ol' Iron Paws.
Oh !
Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock
your pupil senseless,
{y:i}how do you expect him
{y:i}to remember the lesson, hmm ?
Well, I, I, uh--
Well, I didn't mean
to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt.
I'm all right.
- I'm a lot tougher
than some people think.
- You better believe it.
Now, let's go
once more.
I want you to keep circlin',
or I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'--
Hey !
Right on the button.
No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
No. No, n-now, we don't do that
here in the jun-- No !
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.
Help ! Bagheera !
Oh, boy. That's all he needs:
more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo ?
- I give up, I told ya !
Ha-ha !
Oooh ! I give--
Hey ! Ha-ha !
You know somethin' ? You're all right,
kid. What do they call you ?
Mowgli, and he's going back
to the man-village right now.
Man-village ?
They'll ruin 'im !
They'll make a man
out of him !
Oh, Baloo,
I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
Oh ? And just how do you
think he will survive ?
"How do you think--"
What do you mean, how do you think he--
He's with me, ain't he ?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Oh ? That shouldn't
take too long.
Look, now, it's like this,
little britches.
All you gotta do is...
¤ Look for the bare necessities ¤

No.
Just a hair lower.
There. Right there.
That's it. Ohh !
This is beautiful.
Oooh, that's good.

Man !
- It's Baloo, the bear !
- Yeah, that's him !
How'd that square
get in there ?
Baloo ! It's you !
Whew !
Man, that's what I call
a swingin' party !
And furthermore,
Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability
to get into trouble,
and your influence
hasn't been exactly--
Shh ! Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
- {y:i}Ahhh...
- {y:i}Well, he's had a big day.
{y:i}It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.
Hah !
A disgraceful performance.
{y:i}Associating with those undesirable,
{y:i}scatter brained apes ?
Hah. I hope Mowgli learned something
from that experience.
¤ Scooby-dooby-dooby
Dooby-doo ¤
Ha-ha !
That's my boy.
Ohhh, nonsense.
{y:i}Baloo.
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.
"A word" ?
You gonna talk some more ?
All right,
what's up, Bagheera ?
Baloo,
the man cub must go back
to the man-village.
{y:i}The jungle
{y:i}is not the place for him.
{y:i}I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look
at yourself.
{y:i}Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it ?
Frankly, you're
a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket of fruit yourself.
Ohhh !
Uh, Baloo,
{y:i}you can't adopt Mowgli
{y:i}as your son.
Why not ?
H-H-How can I put it ?
{y:i}Baloo,
birds of a feather
should flock together.
- {y:i}You wouldn't marry a panther,
{y:i}would you ?
- I don't know.
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be
serious about this.
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh ?
- Can't a guy make one mistake ?
- Not in the jungle.
{y:i}And another thing,
{y:i}sooner or later
{y:i}Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger ? What's he got
against the kid ?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
{y:i}Because he fears man's gun
{y:i}and man's fire.
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait
until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and--
Ohh !
Well-- Well,
what are we gonna do ?
We'll do what's best
for the boy.
- You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
- Good.
Then make Mowgli go
to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind ?
I promised him he could stay here
in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you,
he's in danger.
- {y:i}So it's up to you.
- Why me ?
B-B-Because he won't
listen to me.
I love that kid.
I love him
like he was my own cub.
{y:i}Then think of what's best for Mowgli
{y:i}and not yourself.
Uh-- Well, can't--
Can't I wait
until morning ?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
Uh--
Uh--
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep
outta your eyes.
You and me, we got
a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, all right,
let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around,
uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub,
and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
¤ Look for the bare necessities ¤
¤ Some good ol'
bare necessities ¤
{y:i}¤Forget about your worries
{y:i}and your strife¤
¤ I mean, the bare necessities ¤
{y:i}¤ That's why a bear
{y:i}can rest at ease¤
{y:i}¤ With just the bare
{y:i}necessities of life¤ Yeah !
{y:i}¤I'll live here in the jungle
{y:i}all my life¤¤
Yeah, man !
I like being a bear.
{y:i}Where we goin',
{y:i}Baloo ?
Well, uh, it's, uh--
Um--
Well, it's sort a new
and, uh--
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh,
look, buddy, uh,
there's somethin'
I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what,
Baloo ?
Oh, gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy
put it ? It's, uh--
Uh, uh, Mowgli--
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would ya ?
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talking about.
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human ?
I'm not any more, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo !
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
-
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter,
old Papa Bear ?
Look, Mowgli, I been tryin'
all morning to tell ya--
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.
- The man-village ?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I, I--
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now, just a minute !
That's goin' too far !
{y:i}Hey, Mowgli!
{y:i}Where you goin' ?
Wait a minute !
Stop !
{y:i}Wait !
Wait !
Listen to ol' Baloo !
{y:i}Mowgli!
{y:i}Mowgli!
{y:i}Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli !
{y:i}Now what's happened ?
Well, y-y-you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera,
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me !
W-Well, don't just
stand there.
Let's separate.
W-We've got to find him !
Oh, if anything happens to that
little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli !
Mowgli !
{y:i}
¤ Hup, two, three, four ¤
¤ Hup, two, three, four ¤
¤ Keep it up, two, three ¤
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous
Colonel Hathi.
Company... sound off !
¤ Oh, we march
from here to there ¤
¤ And it doesn't
matter where ¤
¤ You can hear us push
through the deepest bush ¤
¤ Hup, two, three, four ¤
¤ With a military air ¤

¤ Hup, two, three, four ¤
{y:i}
{y:i}¤For a furlough in the shade¤
Stop !
Wait a minute.
Halt !
- Ohh ! Ohh !
- {y:i}
Who said "halt" ?
I give the commands around here.
{y:i}Well, speak up.
{y:i}Who was it ?
I-It was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over
my command ? Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, I-I'm sorry,
but I need your help.
{y:i}
{y:i}Oh, absolutely impossible.
{y:i}We're on
{y:i}a cross-country march.
{y:i}
{y:i}But it's an emergency, Colonel.
- {y:i}The man cub must be found.
- {y:i}Man cub ? What man cub ?
How interesting.
The one I was taking
to the man-village.
Good.
That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to get on with the march.
{y:i}
{y:i}No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
{y:i}He is lost.
{y:i}He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves
the young whippersnapper right.
But-But Shere Khan,
the tiger,
{y:i}is sure to pick up
{y:i}the man cub's trail.
Shere Khan.
Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war
and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
{y:i}Far enough !
Now, just a minute,
you pompous old windbag !
Winifred !
What are you doing out of ranks ?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy
lost and alone in the jungle ?
{y:i}Our son... alone ?
But, Winifred, old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.
Hmph !
Different, entirely.
That little boy is
no different than our own son.
Now, you help find him,
or {y:i}I'm taking over command.
What ?
A female leading my herd ?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I
are friends.
He'll get hurt
if we don't find him.
{y:i}Please, Pop, sir ?
{y:i}Please ?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.
Huh !
Sure, you did.
Troopers !
Company...
left face !
Volunteers
for a special mission...
will step one pace forward.
Ha-ha !
That's what I like to see.
{y:i}Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, Bugler,
when the man cub is sighted,
{y:i}you will sound your trumpet
{y:i}three times.
Yes, sir.
- ¤¤
- {y:i}Shh !
Not now, soldier.
Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be
the element of surprise.
You will take one squad
and cover the right flank.
{y:i}
{y:i}Yes, sir.
{y:i}
{y:i}And I shall meet the other squad...
{y:i}on the left flank.
{y:i}Very well.
{y:i}
{y:i}Company...
{y:i}
forward... march !
Element of surprise ?
Oh, I say.
And now for my rendezvous...
with the little lost man cub.
Kaa ! It's you !
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me
to look at you ?
Then you look at me.
No, sir.
I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do ?
Uh, I mean,
you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me ?
S-s-certainly.
I can see to it...
that you never have
to leave this jungle.
How could you do that ?
Hmm ?
Oh, I have my own...
s-s-subtle little ways.
But first,
you must trust me.
I don't trust
anyone any more.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like
those so-called...
fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
¤ Trust in me ¤
{y:i}¤Just in me¤
¤ Shut your eyes ¤
¤ And trust in me ¤
Hold still, please.
¤ You can sleep ¤
¤ Safe and sound ¤
¤ Knowing I ¤
¤ Am around ¤
¤ Slip into silent slumber ¤
¤ Sail on a silver mist ¤
¤ Slowly and surely your senses
will cease to resist ¤
You're snoring.
Sorry.
¤ Trust in me ¤
¤ And just in me ¤
{y:i}¤Shut your eyes¤
{y:i}¤And trust in me¤¤
Huh ?
Oh, now what ?
I'll be right down.
Yes ? Yes ?
Who is it ?
{y:i}It's me, Shere Khan.
Uh, I'd like a word with you,
if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.
Yes, isn't it ?
I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've
interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no.
Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.
Coils ? Someone ?
Oh, no.
I was just curling up
for my siesta.
But you were
singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa ?
-  Uh, who ?
Oh, no.
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.
Yes.
Yes, you see, I have...
trouble with my s-s-sinuses.
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible.
I can't eat.
I can't s-s-sleep,
so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis ?
Let me show you how it works.
¤ Trust in me ¤
- Mmm-fff !
- I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time
for that sort of nonsense.
- S-S-S-Some other time, perhaps ?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub" ?
What man cub ?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose
he could be ?
Search me.
{y:i}That's an excellent idea.
{y:i}
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me
your coils, would you, Kaa ?
Uh, s-s-certainly not.
Nothing here,
and nothing in here.
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about
the middle ?
The middle ?
Oh, the middle.
Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Hmm.
Really ?
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub,
you will inform me first.
- Understand ?
-  I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think
he's fooling ?
"Helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me
the s-s-shivers.
Picking on that poor,
little helpless boy.
Oh, yes.
The poor, little helpless boy.
Aaah !
{y:i}
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
{y:i}If I never see that
{y:i}skinny little shrimp again,
it will be too soon.
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.
Hey, Flaps.
What we gonna do ?
I don't know.
What do you wanna do ?
{y:i}I've got it !Let's flap over
{y:i}to the eastside of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene.
Aw, come off it !
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
Very funny.
Okay, so what
we gonna do ?
I don't know.
What do you wanna do ?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do ?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do ?"
Then I say, "What we gonna do ?"
You say, "What you wanna do ?"
What we gonna do, what you want--
Let's do something !
Okay. What do you want to do ?
Oh, blimey.
There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it !
This time, I've really got it.
- So, you've got it.
So what we gonna do ?
- {y:i}Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's
coming our way.
Hey, what in the world
is that ?
{y:i}What a crazy looking
{y:i}bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all
walking about by themselves.
- So what we gonna do ?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start
that again.
Come on, lads.
Come on.
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this little bloke, eh ?
Blimey ! He's got legs
like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. Ha-ha !
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
{y:i}
Go ahead. Laugh.
I don't care.
What's wrong with him ?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having
a bit of fun. That's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
{y:i}You know, he must be
{y:i}down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid !
Wait a minute ! Hey !
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on.
What's wrong ?
You look like you haven't
got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father ?
No.
Nobody wants me around.
Yeah.
We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us
around either.
- Oh, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got hearts.
- And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you,
we're going to let you
join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I--
I'd rather be on my own alone.
Oh, now, look, kid.
Everybody's got
to have friends.
Hey, fellas,
are we his friends ?
¤ We're your friends ¤
¤ We're your friends ¤
¤ We're your friends

Bravo. Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you
for detaining my victim.
Uh, don't mention it,
Your Highness.
- Boo !
-
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room ! Gangway !
-
- Run, friend ! Run !
"Run" ?
Why should I run ?
Why should you run ?
Could it be possible
that you don't know who I am ?
I know you, all right.
- {y:i}You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah ! You have spirit
for one so small,
and such spirit is deserving
of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close
my eyes and count to ten.
{y:i}It makes the chase
{y:i}more interesting... for me.
One...
{y:i}two, three...
four--
You're trying my patience.
{y:i}Five, six, seven, eight,
{y:i}nine, ten.

-
Run, Mowgli. Run !
- Let go, you big oaf !
- Ooh !
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it. Whoa !
-
- Yeow ! Whoa, slow ! Easy, now !
-
-  Whoa ! Easy !
He's got a tiger
by the tail, he has.
{y:i}And he better hang on too.
- Yeow !
- Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid !
Hit him again, kid ! Go on !
- Baloo ! Help me !
- {y:i}
Ooh !
Woo-woo-wooo-wooo !
-
-
Somebody do something
with that kid !
Come on, lads !
He's safe now ! Ha-ha-ha !
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin' ?
There's teeth in the other end.
{y:i}
- Ooof !
- {y:i}
- I'll kill you for this.
-
Let go !
Baloo needs help !
Fire ! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire.
We'll do the rest.
Oof !
Charge !
- Punch and blow !
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools !
Yeah, yeah.
Missed me a mile, he did !
{y:i}
- {y:i}Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers !
-
{y:i}He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is !
Look behind you, chum.
- Well, that's the last of him.
-
Old Stripes took off
like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time
for it. Look.
Baloo ?
Baloo, get up.
{y:i}Oh, please, get up.
Oh.
Mowgli,
try to understand.
Bagheera, what's
the matter with him ?
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.
Y-You don't mean--
Oh, no. Baloo.
Now, now.
I know how you feel.
{y:i}But you must remember,
{y:i}Mowgli.:
{y:i}"Greater love hath no one...
{y:i}than he who lays down
{y:i}his life for his friend. "
{y:i}When great deeds...
are remembered
in this jungle,
one name will stand
above all others:
{y:i}our friend,
{y:i}Baloo the bear.
He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's
sacrifice and bravery...
{y:i}will forever be engraved
{y:i}on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell
will always be...
{y:i}a hallowed place
{y:i}in the jungle,
{y:i}for there lies one of nature's
{y:i}noblest creatures.
I wish my mother
could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great !
There's more.
Lots more !
Why, you big fraud !
{y:i}You-you-you four-flusher!
{y:i}I'm-I'm fed up !
{y:i}
- Baloo, you're all right !
-
Who, me ? Sure I am.
Never felt... better.
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.
{y:i}You know, playin' it cool.
-  But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull
without the little bloke, isn't it ?
Yeah.
So what we gonna do ?
I don't know--
Now, don't start that again !
Hey, Baggy. Too bad
you missed the action.
You should have seen
how I made a sucker...
out of Old Stripes
with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him.
"Wham !"
You wanna know somethin' ?
We're good sparring partners.
-  You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.
