So, Millie...
- Yes.
You Russian?
- Yes.
You are a very beautiful woman.
- Thank you.
You like Indian men?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Very good.
Scram.
So maybe... we can go somewhere.
- Maybe.
Let me tell you
something in your ears.
Yes.
Just a minute.
What?
Tanya.
- You cheat.
You're double timing
both me and my sister.
No, it is not so.
- I'll go and tell mom everything.
She praises you a lot.
Now she too will know what
kind of a person you are.
Goodbye.
- Listen...
Don't tell anything to your mom. Shit.
Forget the daughters, I
lost their mom as well.
Not a problem, I still have Millie.
Millie. How are you?
Damn...
Oh. Hello.
I'm Nainsukhbhai Chamanlal Patel.
You don't need to memorize it.
I don't either.
You know what? You can call me Nano.
Small, sweet and affordable.
Before you say "ta-ta,
Nano" and leave.
Let me tell you, this isn't my story.
It's Sid's. My best friend.
Today is the happiest day of his life.
You know, not every is lucky
enough to have this pleasure.
Lawyer fees Rs. 500,000.
My Omega watch, Rs. 200,000.
My favorite car, Rs. 3000,000.
Breathing bachelor again...
Priceless!
Taxi!
Guys, what will we gift Sid?
Condoms.
Actually, it's a little confusing.
What did we give him for his wedding?
Condoms.
Nice.
Have a look.
Good.
Cut it, boy.
Speech.
Speech. Speech. Speech.
Such a big piece.
Okay. I wasn't half as happy
while having my wedding cake.
The journey from that cake to
this has been full of sufferings.
At the moment, I neither
have a house nor a car.
But...
I don't mind, because
I'm once again single.
"Either this one or that."
"No matter who."
"I'll welcome all those come my way."
"Even if anyone steals my heart."
"No matter whom I meet."
"Even if someone
falls in love with me."
"I'll welcome her with open arms."
"I'm once again single."
"I want to mingle."
"Beware, beautiful girls."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"If we look at each other."
"Our eyes will do the talking."
"We'll spend the night
look at each other."
"We'll exchange
romantic texts at night."
"We will talk about love."
"In those nights, those conversations,
she will surrender her heart."
"Either she or her."
"I should find someone now."
"I'm once again single."
"I want to mingle."
"Beware, beautiful girls."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm someone who is happy
for someone else's happiness."
"I might not come back home."
"No one will question where I was."
"I have nothing to worry about."
"Either this one or that."
"No matter who."
"I'll welcome all those come my way."
"Even if anyone steals my heart."
"No matter whom I meet."
"Even if someone
falls in love with me."
"I'll welcome her with open arms."
"I'm once again single."
"I want to mingle."
"Beware, beautiful girls."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
"I'm single."
What's wrong with Sid?
What happened?
I'll go and see.
Wait, wait, wait.
- Please. Please. Please.
Let the guys handle this.
- Yeah.
You stay here.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- Good luck. - Okay.
Sid.
- Not there. This way.
You are drunk.
Guys. What happened?
You don't have a drink in your hand.
Are the drinks over?
Cut it, Sid. We very well
know how happy you are. Okay?
Don't hide it from us.
You are missing her, right?
- Yeah.
Tell us the truth.
I'm missing her a lot.
I can't believe that she left me.
We had such good times together.
Those long drives.
Just me and her. No one else.
I really miss her, man.
- Me too.
God willing, she will come back.
No. She will have to come back.
- Yes.
She has to come back to me.
Please, guys.
Please don't tell me you are once
again talking about that stupid car.
Hey, please. Don't call it stupid.
And don't you dare call it a car.
She is my love. Look
at her. How beautiful.
She even has a name.
She is my pomp-pomp. My Horny.
Sid, don't you worry.
Your future is rocking.
Really?
- My seventh sense says so.
Not seventh, sixth.
- Yes, it's sixth sense.
Sorry, guys. But my sixth
sense is only for my sexy aunties.
So Sid, you want to know how
bright your future is, right?
Yes, tell me.
- Alright. Listen.
My seventh sense tells me...
Exactly after one year you will have
a chauffeur driven Lamborghini car.
And a palatial sea-facing bungalow.
Shefali!
- Oh! No.
Were you sleeping?
- No.
Give it to me. I will keep it.
- No. No. It's okay.
What are you doing, dear?
I am trying to wear clothes.
You should have at least knocked.
I am sorry.
- It is okay.
What?
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Well, I wouldn't be watching IPL by
sitting nude inside your cupboard.
She is so hot. Try to understand, sir.
You bloody swine.
How dare you? Shut up!
Sorry.
Shefali! Who is he?
- Thief! Thief! Look how he is...
Nude thief, Shefali.
Yes. He must have come
to steal your clothes.
That's why he is hiding inside
the cupboard. - Oh! What nonsense?
You know, chief. I wore
enough clothes while coming.
But I didn't know when I removed them.
You know she was so amazing.
You bloody...
- Take it easy.
Oh, my God!
Look, he tried to attack me and
he himself suffered heart attack.
Hey, did he really
suffer heart attack? Hello.
Sir! Sir! What happened?
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
Oh, my god. He is not breathing.
He is not breathing.
Hey. What are you
doing by sitting there?
Give him mouth to mouth.
He is your husband.
You must be having practice.
At least call the doctor.
Call the ambulance.
Do something. Otherwise he will die.
Not he will die. He has died.
Oh! Yes. Yes! Oh! Yes! Oh! Yes!
God, thank you. Thank you so much.
Finally you heard me.
I promise that...
...I will eat chicken during Navratri
without onions.
What?
Hey, dear. You have
got an ill-fated face.
Old man died
immediately after watching it.
Excuse me. Not excuse me. Thank you.
My three boyfriends were trying
to kill him since last 6 months.
But those useless
guys failed every time.
And you... I met you today.
And work is done
immediately after meeting.
So tell me how I
should say thanks to you.
Shall we finish the work
which was left incomplete...
...before the old man arrived?
- Hey, have little shame.
Your husband died just now.
Yes. Didn't I wear
white colored night dress?
Wow!
Do you know that
there is no tension now?
This entire property is mine.
I will fulfill all my dreams.
Wow! What a woman?
I am sorry my dear ex-wife.
The title of being the worst woman in
this world has been snatched from you.
We have a better girl.
And as far as your
dreams are concerned...
...I have news for you lady.
Bad news.
'My three boy friends are trying
to kill him since last 6 months.'
What is this?
But they are useless...
- Give that to me.
'And I met you today only.'
One minute. One minute. And
now we have the grand finale.
Rise from the dead.
You had lot of interest in
getting my will written.
Forget the will, I will definitely
send all yours bills to you.
But listen to me...
- I see you in court.
But listen to me!
- I said get out.
I said go.
- Bye.
Hey! Give my jeans and go.
I will never repay your favor.
But I can definitely
thank you in this way.
One minute please.
You deposit this money in my account.
The thing is that I feel I am in a
different profession for taking money...
...from you without wearing clothes.
Okay, you take care of yourself.
And that is for you.
Have a good day.
- Thank you.
Didn't you get
shocked on watching Sid?
Hey, how are you?
- Hi, sexy.
Dude became a divorce expert.
Actually people were
scared of Lord Shani before.
These days they are afraid of alimony.
Lord Shani leaves
after seven and half years.
Alimony stays with you all your life.
And Sid will get rid of you from it.
And under this pretext,
I would get newly divorced and
vulnerable fresh aunts.
Look, what happened?
I don't know why he cheated on me.
Don't worry. I am there, okay?
Thank you Sid.
Oh! I am sorry.
But there is a disappointment
in the story of this hero.
Divorce has got him new business.
Sid, who helped the world
couldn't escape from his own alimony.
Even today he has to give half
of his income to his ex-wife.
Poor guy, his ex is
still angry with him.
What did you say? How
does Sid do all this?
Well actually I think...
Oh! Yes, dear.
How does Sid do all this?
What do you mean by how I know?
Presence of mind at the right time.
That is needed.
The person who is entering now.
He will order for 650 ml beer.
Want to see?
One fosters 650 ml please.
And the aunt sitting behind.
- Yes.
She will double the
profit of your bar tonight.
I know it is her fifth shot.
That's why I love aunts.
Yes but she doesn't love her husband.
Because just now she came to know
that her husband is cheating on her.
How do you know?
- Hey, come on, man. Experience, dear.
Yes. On the rocks, buddy.
- Thanks, buddy. Cheers.
And that girl?
Oh! That girl is like
solo intellectual type.
Excuse me. - So she comes
to the bar and orders coke.
Do you have diet coke?
- Sorry. Diet coke.
Great. One large
whisky with diet coke.
Thanks.
What happened to your intelligence?
Has the fuse failed?
Not, dear. Voltage power decreased.
Hey, just now I remembered.
Listen! Listen! Listen!
I think she is Namrata.
She is my client.
I called her here at 6 o'clock.
What are you doing, friend?
Hey, hi. I am Sid.
Hi, Sid.
So tell me.
What?
About your husband.
My husband.
- Yes.
Yes. Fine. Why?
Look, Namrata. If you
don't tell me about...
...your husband then
how will I help you?
Hey, does your husband cheat on you.
No.
Oh, my god.
Does he beat you?
Yes, he beats me.
He tortures me badly.
Such a person should
be taught a lesson.
I have done the same.
I killed him, Sid.
- What...
When he was sleeping in the morning,
I took a big knife...
...and stabbed in his chest.
And I kept stabbing until
he turned red with blood.
Is it?
- Sid. Sid, help me.
Please. Please help me.
Oh!
Hello.
- 'Hi, Sid. Namrata here.'
'I cannot come today.
Sorry about this.'
'Will call you.'
So you are not Namrata.
You are...
What fun. Nice joke. Good. Good.
I am sorry. The matter which
you started, I have finished it.
By the way, I am Ramsay.
I am joking, dear. I am Sonali.
Yes, Hi, Sonali. This is Sid again.
By the way, what was all this.
I thought you were my client. Namrata.
Client?
I am a divorce expert.
I get people divorced without
having any complications and problems.
I think it is fantastic.
Really? - Because my
parents too had a divorce.
Oh! I am sorry. - My mother and
father never loved each other at all.
But they stayed
together because of me.
That's why finally
I got them divorced.
By the way, I am your
senior in this business.
I have solved my
first case 10 years back.
Vijender Singh.
The famous Indian boxer.
- Brother Vijju.
How are you?
- I am fine.
Where is he?
- Sid?
Don't know.
Okay. So you are hiding here?
No, friend. Something fell down.
What fell down?
Why should I tell you? Why are you
chasing me? What's your problem?
If you don't get me rid of my
marriage then I will not spare you.
Hey! Are you threatening me?
I am not scared at all.
Anyways, nothing can
happen with your marriage.
You come and sit.
- No! No! No! I am busy.
What are you doing?
- I am... I am... I am...
What I?
- Mr. Vijender Singh.
He is with me.
- Yes.
Sister-in-law?
Greetings, sister-in-law.
No. Not sister-in-law.
- Then? - She is...
I am his partner. Don't listen.
Okay. This is the matter.
Okay. You listen to my problem.
Come. The matter is that...
Here...
- This is your drink, Gajwa.
Milk.
Mr. Gajju. Why are you crying so much?
What happened?
What is his problem?
His problem is that his wife...
She... With his...
You only tell her, brother Gajju.
What should I say?
Yes.
- Very sad story. You don't cry. - No.
The problem is with demand and supply.
I will tell you from the beginning.
'Lt was once upon a time.
My career was going great.'
'I was a champion. Champion.
'Every boxer I faced was
defeated in my hands.'
'When I would come home
after winning the bout.'
'My wife would keep my prize ready.'
Gajju.
- Present, madam.
What do you wish to
become today, Gajju?
What will you teach today, madam?
'I would lose all the cheese
and butter fed by my mother.'
'There was nothing left for the bout.'
'Gradually boxers made
me their punching bags.'
Hold! Hold! Hold!
'Present the next criminal.'
'Lnitially it was lot of fun.'
'Slowly I have understood that
destiny is playing with me.'
'Finally what I feared has happened.
I was knocked out in the ring.'
There was no problem with supply.
Demand kept increasing.
If I stay with her for few more days...
...then my boxing career
will come to an end.
And if I ask for
divorce citing this reason...
...then what is the use of
becoming a champion bearing such image.
World will laugh at me.
Sorry. But if your wife
loves you so much then...
...you have to adjust a bit. Right?
She doesn't love me at all.
She is filled with lust.
And according to her there
is no man greater than me.
In this situation, I am finished.
Everything is lost.
Kamdev.
Kamdev will do your work.
Look, get it done with Kamdev or
anybody, my work should be done.
Get my work done at any cost.
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!
Drink milk. Please.
You too drink little.
- No. You drink.
Greetings, devotees.
There are many yoga
gurus in our country.
But not a single sex guru.
Baba Kamdev has spent his
entire life on this work.
Baba has got only one guru mantra.
Work. Work. Work.
Morning. Afternoon. Evening.
Silence. Silence.
And today Baba will
teach various techniques...
...which will turn men into...
And women into Dushasan
.
Baba Kamdev!
- Hail!
Baba Kamdev!
- Hail!
Did you give the speech to Nano?
I did, sir. Don't worry.
Good.
Are you drunk?
By the way I've made
all the arrangements.
Have a look.
My dear devotees.
Hey, this is Nano's speech.
What did you give him?
Then where's the bar's menu?
Fakar!
I am proud of all my devotees.
You took out time from
your busy lives and came here.
You idiot.
Bar menu.
New things keep happening outside.
But this is the
question of what lies within.
One Old Monk had said that...
...you should keep the Black
Dog in you in a tight leash.
Otherwise you will be
given a Black Label.
But what can a Virgin Lady do?
There is no "Sex on the beach."
Bloody Mary doesn't even have a Gin...
...from whom she can
ask for a Screwdriver.
Poor Margarita has
turned white from red...
...but no Johnnie Walker
gave her a Thunderbolt.
It's... It's a Royal Challenge.
Even if you have to stay 'On the
Rocks', but don't settle for Small.
Go for Large.
One shot after another.
One shot after another.
One shot after another.
That's when you will get Happy Hours.
Four to eight, plus taxes. VAT extra.
I mean...
What extra does a woman need?
Whiskey. Whiskey...
I wish I could share
this feeling with everyone.
It's a pity that...
...I can share it with only one.
So any auntie...
Any anticipation won't help.
As I said only one fortunate one.
Come on, devotees. Come here one
by one and seek sage's blessings.
And only one will get much
more than his blessings.
Much more.
- I'll slap you.
Please come.
Move.
Kamdev, if you make a mistake,
I'll make you run dressed as a woman.
What a bomb.
Praise the Lord. Lord has signed
that you are that fortunate one.
See you later.
Gajju. How are you?
- Very well, brother.
Was my job done?
- Yes.
This contains Nano's and
your wife's photographs...
...which will make the
judge sweat bullets.
Really?
- No. You don't have a look at them.
You won't be able to endure it.
No. No deed of this
woman can shock me.
I was talking about Nano's state.
Have you seen sugarcane from which
its juice has been extracted? - Yes.
No jaggery or sugar
could be made from it.
It will be help in setting
something on fire. - Right.
More? No. No.
Oh, my God.
This is seriously bad.
Doctor, how is he?
- In a very bad state.
I have already given him
four bottles of glucose.
I am about to give him the fifth one.
There are 2-3 sprains on his back,
a hairline fracture in his hips.
And a very unusual fracture, you know.
I mean his...
- I know. I know.
I don't understand. What has he done?
Not what has he done,
doctor. Ask, who has he done.
Who?
I am really sorry, man. I
thought this would be a fun experience.
Come here.
This is for you.
- Relax.
What?
Hello.
Can you please
get my check, please?
Thanks.
Now what is this?
- Your share.
A fee for a smart idea
and a brilliant speech.
Wow. You actually mint money.
Yeah.
Interesting profession.
Loads of money.
You are so lucky.
- Thank you.
I don't need this.
- Why?
I was just happy to help.
Look, Sonali,
according to my experience...
...relationships should be very clear.
Yes.
- You helped me professionally.
I am paying you for it.
You are not taking the money.
You are not taking the money. It
might create a complication in future.
There won't be any complications.
Sure?
- Yeah.
Happy?
- I guess I am.
Thanks.
- Bye.
Hey Sonali...
I was thinking...
Sir, I need a divorce.
- Why?
I contracted Malaria
when I got married.
I just escaped death.
So didn't your wife support you?
No. No, I mean she did.
She took great care of me.
She took great care of me.
Because of my mother-in-law.
Because of my mother-in-law.
My mother-in-law.
Mother-in-law.
Because of my mother-in-law.
My mother-in-law.
Divorce granted.
Two years after we got married,
I suffered huge loss in business.
I lost everything. I was ruined.
Yet she didn't leave me.
My husband and I have
religious differences.
How?
Like he feels he is God.
But I know that he is a devil.
Divorce granted.
After that, I lost
everything that I had in gambling.
Yet she didn't leave me.
We have health issues.
- What do you mean?
I mean I am just sick of him.
Divorce granted.
A year ago in a cyclone...
My entire family, sir...
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. Thank you very much, ma'am.
Yet she didn't leave me.
What?
So, what's the problem?
You didn't get it?
She is inauspicious.
Bad luck.
Divorce granted.
Sonali, I'd like you
to meet Sahil and Isha.
Hi.
- Hi.
They are my foster parents.
They have adopted me.
Adopted you?
Wow. You guys have
been doing a great job.
It's been really tough.
- Really tough.
It's great to finally meet you.
Because nowadays,
Sid only praises you.
All the time. - And we thought
today would be a great day to see you.
Really?
I didn't think that you
would celebrate Valentine's day.
I do. It's a fantastic day.
People fall in love. They
express it. Then they get married.
And then they come straight to us.
And then of course our business does...
How unromantic.
- Totally.
You and your
fundamentals of love. God.
Hey, there's logic behind it.
As if you believe in
love and marriage.
Of course, I do. I believe
in both love and marriage.
I thought that after you got
your parents divorced, you don't...
That's not the point.
- What is the point?
The point is marriage is the
ultimate destination for love.
Sometimes we fall in love or
get married to the wrong person.
But divorce gives us another
chance to find our true love.
We like this.
- We like this.
Nano, you are still on duty?
No. It's business during
the day and home at night.
Wow, man. I love this.
Guys, finally Sid is
yearning for a heart.
Have you lost your mind?
What kind of a doctor are you?
I think you cheated and
cleared your exams. - Shut up.
Of course it is true, because the shape
of our heart is nowhere close to this.
The only part it resembles is...
Oh no.
A bum.
- Oh yeah.
And it can give only one thing.
Potty.
Potty. Potty. Potty.
Nano, come let's eat.
- No, you eat it.
Why? What happened?
I have an upset stomach since morning.
Think of it that I am
expelling a lot of love out.
Oh no.
- Disgusting.
More love is going to come out.
Yuck.
Divorce granted.
Today is taxi strike.
You earn good money.
Why don't you buy a car?
Oh! Believe it or not.
Because of love. - Really?
Here's my first love.
My Horny.
But she is no longer
with me. She left me.
I won't rest in peace
till I don't get her back.
How sweet. Horny. She had an accident?
No, I had an accident.
I got divorced and she
is now with my ex-wife.
Excuse me? What?
You are divorced and
you didn't even tell me.
When did you tell me that you
believe in love and marriage?
People get divorced
for such weird reasons.
By the way, what was your reason?
Can we concentrate on the case?
- Yes, of course.
You don't look like
the one who will cheat.
Was she cheating on you?
Sonali, let's just
concentrate on the work.
Sorry.
Now we won't discuss
this topic at all.
Thank you.
Listen...
You are not impotent, right?
Fine. Let's go.
- Where?
Come let me show it to you...
- Where?
Otherwise you won't
believe me. You wanted to know.
I will prove it to you.
- No.
Hey, what is this, guys?
- Sorry.
You are making noise at 1:00am?
Decent people are sleeping.
What happened, darling?
Nothing, baby. Nothing to worry.
Sure, love?
Yuck.
Who was she?
Our next client.
Mark Pereira's wife.
The business tycoon Pereira?
Yes. - Wow.
Lucky girl.
- Not really.
She just found out
that he's cheating on her.
In fact, right now he is in Greece,
with his mistress.
What ajerk. Let him come back.
We'll teach him a lesson.
Yes, but why should we
wait for him to come back?
What do you mean?
We too can go there.
Greece?
Really.
Yes, a work and leisure trip.
Wow.
Babes, need any help?
- No, I am done.
Oh God. Such a big bag.
This case is very complicated, right?
Nothing to do with the case.
Just taking some
personal girlie stuff.
Dresses for occasions.
I thought this is an official trip.
But it looks like you are
going for a different trip.
By the way if you go out
for fun, take him with you.
Not me, he will take me
sightseeing in Greece.
He has promised me.
Really?
- Yeah.
Okay. Here comes coffee,
lots of mint and menthol. Done.
These are Sid's things?
Perhaps these things
aren't available in Greece.
By the way, have you do
this for anyone before?
Isha. - See, Greece is
a romantic destination.
Clearly, you are very excited.
You are taking so
many clothes with you.
And Sid has promised you
that he will take you out.
I don't know about you but I am
getting that "couple" feeling.
You know I can sense it.
Something is surely
going to happen in Greece.
Isha, you are mad.
No, Sonali. You are mad.
Let us leave. We are getting late.
I don't want to miss this flight.
- Yes.
Less work and more holidays in Greece.
"Have you ever got this feeling?"
"Can you hear me calling I love you?"
"Standing here beside you, want
so much to give you and love you."
"Why am I excited when I am with you?"
"Why does this city look
beautiful when you are with me?"
"Why do I feel that
your feelings are mine?"
"Why does this city look
beautiful when you are with me?"
"When I am with you, time flies."
"When I am with you,
tell me why silence speaks."
"Why does this world
look like heaven?"
"Why does the sky start
worshiping when I am with you?"
"I am with you."
"Yes, I am with you."
"I am with you."
"I am with you."
"The moments I spend
with you I feel...
...as if happiness is being
sold for free everywhere."
"My breath feels musical when I am..."
"When I am with you."
"When I am with you."
"I am with you."
"Yes, I am with you."
"I am with you."
"The path treaded a
million times seems new."
"Why do I once again feel
that any distance is less?"
"My desires come alive when I am..."
"When I am with you."
"When I am with you, time flies.
- I am with you."
"When I am with you,
tell me why silence speaks."
"Why does this world
look like heaven?"
"Why does the sky start worshiping
when I am with you? - With you."
"I am with you.
- With you."
"Yes, I am with you."
"Have you ever got this feeling?"
"Can you hear me calling I love you?
- I love you."
"Should have seen it coming,
got me caught for nothing."
"I love you."
"I am with you."
Thank you.
- You are welcome.
Feel good?
- Yeah. Nice.
Oh, my God. Mark
this is the night club...
...everyone in the
hotel is talking about.
Please, we will go
there for sure, tomorrow.
Please Mark. Please.
I have some other plans for tomorrow.
Not this.
- Please, book a table for tomorrow.
After that we will go
wherever you want. Promise,
Promise?
- Promise. Wherever you say.
You will do whatever I say?
- Anything.
What about...
Shut up.
- What? Come on.
No.
Hi. What are you doing?
Proofs. What else?
Have a look.
- Yes.
You know what, Sonali?
I was thinking of using these
proofs in a different manner this time.
In fact, we shouldn't use them.
What?
- Yes.
I have a plan.
- Okay.
Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.
Come on.
- Let's go.
Sonali. You know I
have met Mrs. Pereira.
And she's a really-really sweet lady.
So I was thinking, instead of
getting Mr. And Mrs. Pereira divorced...
...why don't we break
Mark and Maggie's pair?
At least Mrs. Pereira will have
a chance of saving her marriage.
Because she is sure Mark
will come back to her.
So, what do you think?
Are you sure?
No, I too am not sure.
But I feel that this is
the right thing to do.
Looks like your bum
has started beating,
It's your fundamental, right?
That marriage is the
final destination of love.
So, I thought that this time
we should unite the love birds.
And save Mark from the shopping mall.
What do you say? - Okay.
Let's go.
Mrs. Pereira, other than
being Mark's life partner...
...is also his business partner.
In fact, she is going
to come here next week...
...to attend a business
conference with Mark.
What if Mrs. Pereira
comes a week early?
Sonali, you are very slow.
Why?
Hi, Mrs. Pereira.
What do you think?
Hello, Mark.
Coffee.
You take such good care
of my likes and dislikes.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry, Mark. I am not
here to spoil your honeymoon.
I called you a number of times.
You didn't answer any.
The meeting we were
to have with Costa...
...is taking place today.
If the deal is not signed
today then I don't know.
So you know what? Enjoy your coffee.
Call me.
Mark.
- Yeah?
What is this, Mark?
You had promised me that...
...you will come with me for
the opening of Club Medusa.
I know. I know, Maggie. But
I have to go to Athens today.
Costa is leaving for Germany tonight.
And I cannot skip this meeting.
Please try and understand.
I don't want to understand anything.
You had promised "no work".
Maggie.
Maggie, one last meeting.
Trust me. - You are
saying this. How would I know?
Baby, it's important.
You know I wouldn't
have gone otherwise.
Right?
- Fine. Go.
Go for sure.
But remember I won't
change my program.
I'll go there alone.
You wait and see.
Mark.
I'll go there alone and dance. And
I'll also flirt with Greek boys.
I'd like to see that.
Do make a video of it.
Let's go.
- Mark.
Wait forjust two minutes. I
have opened many such locks.
This lock...
- Excuse me. - Yes?
Hi. We left our keys inside.
Could you please help us?
Okay. No problem, madam.
- Yeah.
I'll open it for you.
Just a moment.
Thank you. I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
My wife keeps forgetting the keys.
- It's okay. No problem. - Thank you.
I'll open it for you. For your wife.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
Hello. Yeah, I'm
calling from Villa 214.
I would like to book a
massage for tonight.
Yeah, around nine.
Yeah, one more thing.
I want the hottest
masseur that you guys have.
Yeah? Thank you.
What was that? What?
Okay. How dense of me.
I'll just be back.
You are mad.
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen and welcome to Club Medusa.
Tonight is the opening night.
And we bring to you the
super hot babe from Bollywood.
Who is going to set fire to
this stage with her super hot...
...super sexy and super cool number.
Bipasha.
So ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Maggie.
"Come on."
"Yeah."
"Come on."
"Just like that."
"I love you."
"Love sets desire on fire."
"I hope Bipasha doesn't catch one."
"Everyone here has laid a trap."
"I hope Bipasha doesn't get trapped."
"Everybody. Everybody
come on, shake a leg."
"Why don't you create a scene?"
"I know... I know you
are different than me."
"No, I won't give you false hope."
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"Bipasha."
"Come, make your dreams come true."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"I am not so easy."
"I am not so easy."
"You can never ever get Bipasha."
"Come, my breath
will set you on fire."
"Come, my beauty will drown you."
"Come, no force will be useful."
"Come, you will regret
once you are in my arms."
"Talk to your nave heart."
"Get rid of your trouble."
"Anyone who fell in love
with me will regret it."
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"Bipasha."
"Come, make your dreams come true."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"I am not so easy."
"I am not so easy."
"You can never ever get Bipasha."
"Bips, you got the eyes,
you got the lips."
"Now come on, shake your hips."
"You got the moves,
you got the grooves."
"I cannot control myself anymore."
"Now come on, shake your hips."
"You got the moves,
you got the groove."
"You are magic, Bipasha."
"You are mesmerizing, Bipasha."
"You are intoxicating, Bipasha."
"You are amazing."
"Go, you won't be able to love."
"Go, you won't be
able to live with me."
"Go, you will die for no reason."
"Go, you will burn."
"Talk to your nave heart."
"Get rid of your trouble."
"Anyone who fell in love
with me will regret it."
"Never going to get her, baby.
Never going to get her, baby."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"Bipasha."
"Come, make your dreams come true."
"Bipasha."
"Come, let me teach you
the language of love."
"I am not so easy."
"You can never ever get Bipasha."
Madam, you ordered a massage?
I didn't order any massage.
Madam, we have a caller ID.
The call was made from your room.
Look, I didn't order for any massage.
There must be some confusion.
But anyway...
This is for you. You may leave.
What a lovely lady.
Thank you, madam.
You are welcome.
So how was it? You had fun without me?
Yes, I had a lot of fun.
Greek men are stupendous.
- I saw.
The man you were
paying looked like a stud.
He? He said that someone from
our villa ordered for a massage.
Yeah, sure. Massage.
Wait a minute. You doubt me?
I don't doubt you. I am sure about it.
After an amazing dance one
needs an amazing massage, right?
What the hell are you talking about?
That I'm not a fool.
What? How could...
Mark!
Mark!
Mark!
Mark!
Mark!
What is wrong with you?
What is this?
- What?
Do you have an
explanation for this affair?
Mark.
Mark, what's wrong? Mark.
Maggie, I don't want to hear it.
I can't believe this.
I don't want to deal with it.
Mark. Mark.
You are here like this?
What happened, Mark?
Can I...
Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course. Please, come in.
Don't worry, baby.
Everything will be fine.
Anyway, finally all that
matters is that you are with me.
Mark, your drink.
Take it.
- Sorry.
Hello.
Yes.
That's good.
Congratulations. Have a
great time. Enjoy yourself.
Bye.
Got it. Yes!
What?
- Congratulations.
Mr. And Mrs. Pereira
are back together.
It's time to celebrate, right?
- Yeah.
Excuse me. Yeah. Hi.
Can I have a bottle
of champagne, please?
Hey, hey, hey. No champagne for me.
Why? - I become a different
person when I drink Champagne.
It's good. We will get to
see another form of Sonali.
Sonali No. 3. It's good.
Yeah, right.
Oh, that was quick. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Close your eyes.
Voila.
Okay, so cheers to our great victory.
Come on, lift it.
Sid, you are in trouble.
You won't be able to handle me.
Really?
So it's a challenge?
Fine. Game's on.
Fine. Cheers.
Don't say that I didn't warn you.
Okay?
- Okay, done.
Let's party.
Come on.
Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
Tell me about your first crush.
My first crush was Rasna Orange Crush.
No.
Tell me about your first love.
My first love.
My seventh grade history teacher,
Mrs. Mathews.
Long hair, big eyes.
An amazing smile that
would make you happy, you know.
And the most beautiful,
sweet lips in the world.
Lips.
Better than mine.
Of course.
Let me have a look. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move. Okay?
Actually, your lips are
very beautiful as well.
But Mrs. Mathews' lips
were something else.
Rubbish.
- Really.
Champagne is over.
Hello.
- Hello.
Nice man.
Take this and give us one
more of this, please. - Yes.
Sorry, lady, but the bar is closed.
Come on. One last drink, my
friend from Greece. - Please.
Sorry. Good night.
Let's do one thing.
Let's use our Indian tactics.
Let's try it.
- Try it. Come on.
Hey listen, I will
give you this 100 Euros...
...and this pretty, sweet
lady with luscious lips...
...will give you a kiss.
- Hey.
I can't do that.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.
One has to sacrifice to party.
This is nothing. Do it. Do it. Do it.
Okay. I will take the money.
- Thank you.
Only, I don't want a kiss from her.
Okay. Fine.
I want a kiss from you.
I won't do it. I won't.
You have to sacrifice a
little to party. - This is rape.
He will do it.
- Hey, I...
Thank you.
Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting.
Give it to me.
- No.
Just a minute, please.
Hey! You are wasting it.
It is wasted.
The entire evening got ruined.
I kissed him and you are
drinking the champagne.
Give it to me.
Thank you.
Today's scene was very good.
- Scene?
But you are such a lousy kisser.
Yuck.
I'm a lousy kisser?
You would make a similar face if
you had to kiss a foolish girl.
And as far as my kissing
capabilities are concerned...
You can ask 24 girlfriends of mine.
They will vouch for it.
Really?
- Yes.
Are you a kissing expert?
I am. I am. Yes, I am.
Okay.
Fine then, tell me what
the best part of kissing is.
Disgusting.
The best part of kissing is
exactly a moment before the kiss.
Really?
When you don't know
whether you will kiss or not.
If you do, how will it be.
Will the other
person agree to it or not.
That moment.
Who waits a moment before a kiss?
I just get to work. I get into it.
No.
Seriously.
- Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. No.
I will show you.
- Show it to me. Show it to me.
Look here.
No glasses.
Where are you?
- Right here.
Okay, now don't move.
- Okay.
When two people are this close...
- Oh my.
Then their eyes meet.
Then they look at the lips.
When two people are this close...
They can feel each other breathing.
- I can. I can.
Their heads bend a little.
Then their eyes close.
- Yes.
And then that moment...
But Mrs. Mathews'
lips are something else.
Shut up. Go to her then.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen.
- What happened?
There is a problem.
- What happened?
There is a lizard in my room.
I hate lizards.
Me too.
- I won't sleep in my room.
Okay.
- I am sleeping in your room.
Fine. I will sleep on the couch.
And you can sleep on the couch.
Okay.
- What am I saying?
Sorry. I will sleep on the couch
and you can sleep on the couch.
Let's go.
- Very good idea. Let's go.
Sonali, can I ask you something?
You are so beautiful.
You are smart.
You are talented. Etcetera. Etcetera.
How come you are still single?
You know I believe in fairy tales.
I still didn't find
my charming prince.
But I haven't stopped looking.
Soon I will find him.
I will see for how long
he will stay away from me.
Yes, look for him. Look for him.
But Sonali, don't look for a loser.
Who keeps an account of every
moment and every penny, in life.
You know who is very selfish.
We will surely go to
uncle's place because he is rich.
No need to call aunt at home.
She has no class.
We will surely attend our
new neighbor's birthday party.
Because a lot of influential
people come to their place.
Meet him. Don't meet him.
Let me tell you Sonali...
...don't fall in love with an
"I Me Myself" kind of a person.
Who always keep an
account of everything.
I made that mistake.
I was in love.
And after two months love
ended and accounting started.
Sonali, when your heart breaks,
it hurts a lot.
It's hell.
It feels as a hand has ripped
your heart apart from your body.
Hey.
Sonali.
Wait a minute.
Sonali. What happened
to your special moment?
I missed it.
Let's do it again.
Sonali, is there really
a lizard in your room?
It's right in front of me.
My dear ex-husband, thank you.
You are now free.
Your days of alimony are over.
Congratulations.
Thank you my dear ex husband.
Had it not been for you then
it was not possible for me...
...to separate Marc and
Mrs. Magi Pereira.
Now Marc is mine and Honey is yours.
Isha! Isha! Isha!
Sorry. Isha.
Sid. When did you return?
And what are you doing here?
I am here to eat 'Pani Puri' .
Why is your phone switched off?
I've been trying to
call you since so long.
Have you lost your mind?
An operation is going on.
Forget him.
The real emergency is in my life.
I'll have a cardiac
arrest if you don't help me.
Shut up, Sid and leave.
I'll call you after 2 hours.
Go.
- No. No. No.
Isha, listen to me. - Leave.
I don't want to hear anything.
Have you lost your mind? Leave.
- At least listen to me.
An operation...
- I had sex with Sonali.
What?
- What?
I mean I had sex with Sonali.
I mean damn, yeah.
What? - Yeah.
You had sex with Sonali?
- Yeah. Who are you?
Oh, Dr. Khurana. How are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Should I give you four options?
- No. It's obvious.
How's your life after divorce?
I hope your new wife doesn't beat you.
I mean... Look, our
clients found out everything.
What should I do now?
Will you calm down and relax.
We will talk after
the operation. Okay?
Calm down? Relax?
What if Sonali falls in love with me?
And worse, what if she holds
me responsible for all this?
Just shut up. You also know that
Sonali is not that kind of a girl.
Yes, but she is a girl.
And girls cannot be trusted
when it comes to this.
Right.
- Right?
You are absolutely right, my friend.
At first my wife was my friend.
One night after we got drunk...
And after that...
Shit.
Such a big punishment
for getting sloshed once?
Right. See. I told you.
I... I am doomed.
Sir, by the way if you want a
divorce you should get in touch with me.
I'm really good at this. - Really?
- Will you stop this nonsense?
And you should stop overreacting.
I am overreacting?
- This is what all the men do.
First they have all the fun...
...and they back out when it is
time to shoulder the responsibility.
Okay. Okay. Do only we men
have all the fun? - Yes.
You women also have just as much fun.
- Yes.
After that they all act
innocent by doing this.
Dr. Kelkar, how dare you?
- Like this.
Disgusting. After all the education
your thinking has still not changed.
You bloody male chauvinist pig.
Pig?
- Yes. - Please.
Can we concentrate on the operation?
Dr. Khurana, please keep quiet.
You get beaten up by your
wife at home. - What? What?
What are you saying?
- How can you say that?
What do you know about it?
- I just found out.
That is his job.
- Dr. Kelkar, how can you.
A fight at home doesn't mean...
Keep quiet. Dr. Khurana, you...
- Quiet.
Stop your nonsense.
For how long can a patient be patient?
And you are playing with my life?
- No, sir.
Do you think this is
child's play? Fool.
And you? Idiot.
- Yes, sir. Sorry.
You are standing here
and wasting your time.
Go to that girl and talk to her.
Specifically discuss it with
her and find out what she feels.
And you idiots, concentrate on
the operation. - Right, sir.
Do you know how much
money I have spent?
I tell you, nothing can be done
for the medical services in India.
Come on, start the operation.
I've loads more to do. - Okay.
What is this, man?
Ever since you have returned
from Greece you stay quiet.
Tell me something. How are
the sexy babes of that place?
They are hot, right?
- Nano, my brother, I've a request.
For a while don't talk about
sex or anything related to that.
Just say that I should
keep quiet for a while. - Yes.
That's what I am saying,
keep quiet for a while.
Just one thing. Please tell me.
- Shut up, Nano. Please, man.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
- Hey, Sonali.
You know, how was Greece?
I heard the sexy babes there...
- Shut up!
Sid. Sid, I want to talk to you.
Actually, me too. Thank God.
- Mr. Sid...
Yes?
- Mr. Tejani is here.
Who Tejani? - You gave him
an appointment for today.
I am fed up of my wife.
There is no love between us.
And no relationship
since the last two years.
Any special reason for all this?
Sweety. She works in my office.
And we were friends
at first and then...
One night in an office
party we got madly drunk
and then you know what happened.
And now we are totally inseparable.
We are in love.
And we want to get married.
- No!
No. You shouldn't do that.
Excuse me? I am sorry?
No, no. You will be
sorry if you get married.
You see we sometimes
get drunk and then...
...do some things which
we shouldn't, you know.
And you can
apologize for that, you know.
Marriage is not a
solution for all these things.
But Sid, I really love Sweety.
Mr. Tejani, you don't
need to feel guilty.
And you don't need
to apologize either.
Both of you were drunk.
You didn't force her for it.
Thank God.
- What are you saying?
I really love Sweety.
What are you saying?
Listen, forget about love.
Let's get down to business.
Both of you work together.
In the same office. - Yes.
If you get married what will
your clients think about you?
Your business will get ruined, right?
We work in a garments company.
What does that have to
do with our marriage?
Forget about work.
What about friendship?
You know both of you
have so much fun together.
You go around.
Everything will be
over after marriage.
Yeah. I mean totally. Totally. Really.
Stop your nonsense.
Do you stop people from
getting married or get them divorced?
You guys are totally out
of sync, man. What the hell!
God.
This is our first
failure out of 112 cases.
What are we doing, Sonali?
Forget it, Sid. Anyway, we weren't
going to do this after marriage.
What?
Will we get people
divorced after we get married?
Good that you didn't let
Tejani find out anything.
Let's keep the
wedding low profile, okay?
By the way, how does
the 18th suit you?
Sid. 18th.
Sonali...
That...
You were joking.
Got you.
- Wow. Oh, my God. Yes!
Got you again.
- Got me again.
What do I do with you?
You are not that good that
I'll fall in love with you.
Thanks for the compliment.
I need another drink. Nano!
Thanks, buddy.
That was actually a naughty one.
Hey, Isha. You were absolutely right.
Sonali isn't like other girls.
She is really quite out
of the world, I tell you.
You know she didn't
speak about that night.
She's really cool.
What?
What happened?
Hey.
Hi. Sorry. This is a
little embarrassing. I was...
I don't know whether
you'd understand this or not.
Sonali, I really had to do it.
This woman had everything.
My money, my car.
I mean the alimony was
killing me. I had no other choice.
I hope you understand.
I know you won't understand.
And perhaps that's
why I didn't tell you.
Come on, Sonali. We
have seen so many couples.
Does anyone stay happy after marriage?
Do they?
What difference does it
make if Mark and Maggie spilt?
What difference does
it make to anyone?
There is no such thing called love.
I... am trying to make her understand.
Now I get it.
You are pulling my leg again, right?
Like this. Like this.
I got you. I got you this time.
I am not falling for it this time.
Why doesn't she say anything?
Why are you quiet, goddamn it?
We have spilt a lot
of couples, together.
But I didn't know...
...the last one will be ours.
I quit, Sid.
Fine!
Hey.
Why aren't you answering the phone?
Forget it. - We've been looking
for you since the last three hours.
It's okay.
- Enough. You've had enough. Get up.
No, don't do that. One more please.
Come on. Let's go home. Let's go.
- Let go. Leave me alone, Sahil.
I'm absolutely fine.
What's your problem?
Talk to him. I'm absolutely fine.
I'm absolutely fine.
I am okay.
If you want to be
rocking then look there.
Priya. Remember?
You chased her for six months.
Yes.
- Lucky dog.
And today you are
getting to be with her.
What are you saying?
- Yes.
Hey. Thanks.
Good luck, buddy.
What?
I missed you, Sid.
Baby. Love you baby.
Where were you?
Sid.
Sid.
Sonali, you are amazing.
You are amazing, Sonali.
Sonali?
Who's Sonali?
I'm sorry.
Sid!
"The one which was beyond words."
"The one who filled the void."
"There was something between us."
"How should I take this
relationship further?"
"Should I end the tie?"
"Or should I leave it, in between?"
"A nameless relationship."
"A nameless relationship."
"It makes you restless."
"The one that cannot be expressed,
between us."
"Between us. Between us."
"Between us. Between us."
"There was something between us."
"Between us. Between us."
"Between us. Between us."
"There was something between us."
"Oh, it's a special feeling."
"These moments between us."
"How will I live without you?"
"Between us."
"Oh, it's a special feeling."
"These moments between us."
"How will I live without you?"
"Your image still lingers in my eyes."
"I cannot distance myself from
your memories even if I want to."
"Your presence can be felt
even after you have left."
"Why do you dwell in
my heart as a desire?"
"Why do I think of you?"
"Why do I end and then
I exist once again?"
"Where have you brought me?"
"A nameless relationship."
"It makes you restless."
"The one that cannot be expressed,
between us."
Yes. Tell me, Nano.
Sid, quickly come to the hospital.
Hospital? Why? What happened?
An operation. Don't
ask questions. Just rush.
Whose, Nano? Yes? Hello?
Nano!
What happened?
What's the emergency?
Who isn't feeling well?
I have to do an open-heart surgery.
Who?
- You.
Sit.
- Come on.
What are you doing?
- Quiet. - Keep quiet and sit.
Remain seated.
- What nonsense is this, guys?
Till we don't spilt your
heart open and show you...
...you won't
understand who lies in it.
Who?
Sonali.
- Come on.
Look, I know that
you guys love me a lot.
And you want to take care of me.
But this time you guys
are absolutely wrong.
You guys are firing blind.
It's not so.
Oh really?
- Yes.
Sid, I've seen a fool bigger
than you when it comes to love.
You sometimes give your heart
to Ira and sometimes to a car.
Don't call it "any car".
Yes, please. Horny.
- Don't call it a car.
Both of you, keep quiet.
Come on, Sid. - Listen, I agree
that that incident has disturbed me.
But love? Not at all.
And as far as my heart is
concerned it is beating just fine.
So, please, just stop it.
Stop it, guys.
Come on, guys.
Good, you at least
acknowledged that you have a heart.
Otherwise until a few
days back it was your bum.
According to you, we aren't
doing an open-heart surgery on you...
...but an operation for piles.
Sid.
Look, for the first time in life...
...you have given your
heart to the right girl.
Let it stay with her.
She will take good care of it.
Won't you listen to
a heart specialist?
Admit it. You are in love with Sonali.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Operation successful.
I knew it.
- Really? - Yes!
Thanks, guys.
But I don't know about Sonali.
We don't need to worry
about Sonali's feelings.
She isn't confused like you
She knows that she hates you.
- Stop it.
Tell me, did both of you
talk since the time she left?
Any idea where she is
and how she is doing?
So... It's okay.
Step one.
We'll find out where she
is and how she is doing.
Come on. Let's do it.
Now Sonali doesn't get up in
the morning and go to the bar.
She has chosen a healthy way of life.
- Five.
'Om.'
Now she gets up every
morning and does yoga.
Six to eight.
In short, her life is
absolutely comfortable.
'Om.'
Sonali, no longer breaks marriages.
She breaks bones.
And I think she is very happy.
You know it this jogger's park
no one has a stamina like Sonali.
After doing yoga and
boxing the whole day...
...she runs here for
two years every evening.
And the speed with
which she is running...
...I don't think she needs anyone.
Hey...
I was wrong. She doesn't hate you.
In fact, you are not
even a part of her life.
You don't exist for her anymore.
Shut up.
You talk without thinking.
Sid, try to understand.
She is doing all this so
that she can run away from you.
Exactly.
She isn't
running on a treadmill.
She is running away from you.
No, guys I think... this
idiot is right. - Yes.
She is over me. She
no longer needs me.
Don't be silly.
I'm fine. I'm okay with it.
I really am.
Esha, I don't want to
come inside the hospital.
Hey, come inside. I
will buy you coffee.
I will wait here for 10 minutes.
Hey, what is the problem?
Why are you doing drama?
Hey, leave it.
I don't want to
leave the vehicle alone.
You and your vehicle.
I don't get it. Absolutely paranoid.
Hey, nothing will happen
to your vehicle. Calm down.
It is doctor's parking, right?
It is my first love.
I know. But I don't get it.
You know today's patient...
- Yes.
His operation took
place a month or so ago.
This is his fourth follow-up.
He's just really paranoid.
- Okay.
But I am his doctor so what do I do?
Sorry.
Mrs. Pereira. You are pregnant.
Please be careful.
I am so sorry.
- Thank you.
I, too, just found out.
And I was shocked.
I made a big mistake by
listening to Ira, Sonali.
We really have to
get them back together.
Why, Sid? Did she cancel the deal?
Or is someone paying you
more to get them back together?
Yes?
Sonali, I won't give
any justifications.
Because I know no
explanation will be right and enough.
But I know that I will
get them back together.
This is very difficult, Sonali.
I really need you for this.
Please.
Hi.
My dear ex-husband.
I thought you wanted freedom from me.
What are you doing here?
Ira, I'll pay you alimony
for the rest of your life.
I really will give
you whatever you want.
Whatever I want?
Seriously?
Ira, we cannot
separate Mark and Maggie.
We have to get them back together.
And seriously, why would I do that?
Because...
Because Maggie is pregnant.
What?
Sid, are you serious?
- I am serious.
Oh, thank God.
Thank God the timing was perfect.
I mean one month here or there
and the entire plan would go bust.
Mark would have never left Maggie.
Shit. Thank God.
You are unbelievable.
How can you stoop so low?
Really, I mean.
- Oh, come on, baby.
Life's like bungee jumping.
The fun is in the fall, right?
After breaking marriages you
have started breaking cars as well?
Why, Sid? Whose anger are
you venting out on this Horny?
Sid, two things.
Number one: I am not
coming back to you.
That's over and done with.
I am just helping you
with this assignment.
Because I too had a hand in
separating Mark and Maggie.
And number two: No battle
can be won without homework.
What is this? - Mark and
Maggie's divorce application file.
It contains all the details.
How did you get it?
I've learnt from my past mistakes.
I've done a thorough research.
So that no one can use me again.
Now that you have
done so much research...
...also tell me what
needs to be done next.
Meet Madonna.
Madonna?
Marc Pereira's granny.
She lives in Goa.
Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry. Youngster's show is at night.
Actually, we have come to talk
to you about Mark and Maggie.
Mark and Maggie?
In short, we are the
villains of their love story.
Not us, granny. Me.
I did all this. I am really sorry.
How dare you!
You separated my Mark and Maggie.
You bloody rascals.
You are making a
bloody business out of this.
Shameful.
I know I deserve more than this,
but I am... I am really sorry, granny.
Sorry? How will sorry help?
Sorry.
Granny.
- Granny.
We want to rectify our mistake.
We want to make them sit
and tell them everything.
But... at the moment they don't
even want to see each other's face.
Granny, we need you.
They will surely
come if you call them.
Please, granny.
And what if things
don't go back to normal?
Then your hand and my cheek.
You can continue hitting
me till they don't come.
Excuse me.
- What?
My darling Madonna.
Mark, my handsome prince.
How are you?
- Very well, thank you, Mark.
Except, I have got some pimples.
Pimples?
Yes. One gets pimples
in adolescence, right?
Are you busy? Should I call you later?
Don't be funny, granny. I
always have time for you.
You know that.
Are you alright?
What can be wrong with me?
Young and rocking.
You don't worry about me. Work
well and don't worry about me.
Relax.
Flight to Goa leaves at four.
He will be home by six.
Maggie, my darling. How are you?
Mark is here.
Thermometer.
- Here.
Madonna.
I knew it. You are not well.
It took me just a
minute to understand.
My son. My life.
Who will understand
if you won't? Tell me.
You should take your
age into consideration.
How much will you lie?
Where is Maggie?
Maggie...
Granny.
Maggie.
My God, you are pregnant.
I'm going to be a great grandmother.
Why didn't you tell me? Why
are you hiding this from me?
You didn't think it
was important to tell me?
I don't believe this.
Granny. Granny.
Granny.
Granny. Granny, please.
Maggie.
I am asking you something.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?
Why didn't you tell
me you are pregnant?
Why do I need to tell you?
Maggie, this child as
much mine as it is yours.
Really? You have a lot of confidence.
How do you know that
this child is yours?
You were confident that I
was sleeping around in Greece.
That's why you left me
alone over there, right?
Yes?
Well...
Maggie, whatever
happened that night...
Mark, it's not just about that night.
The truth is there is no
love or trust left between us.
You know what, Mark?
Even if I had seen you
with a woman in bed...
...I would have at least
given you a chance to explain.
Maggie... this is not the place...
- To hell with you.
The problem is more
serious than we thought.
Maggie will never forgive Mark.
No, if we tell Maggie
everything she will understand...
...that it is all my fault.
And that Mark is not at fault.
That idiot's mistake is
that he suspected Maggie.
Problem is that both of them have
forgotten the love that they had.
Now you two have to do something.
You have split this couple.
Now you will unite them.
Granny.
Granny, Mark is here.
Go inside. I will talk to him.
- Granny.
Granny, where are you?
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Sid.
- Hi, Sid.
This is Sonali.
- Hi.
Hi, Sonali. Pleased to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.
We met granny at aunt
Anita's place in London.
We came to Goa and she
said stay for a few days...
...and we did as she
wasn't keeping well.
Good. Thanks for staying. Do you
know where she is? - No problem.
Granny?
- Yes.
Yeah. She is in that room.
- Thanks.
Granny.
Granny.
I'm sorry, granny. How
many times should I say sorry?
Tomorrow after I
leave you will miss me.
I will come out on one condition.
If both of you promise that you
will stay here with me for a week.
Say yes, she isn't keep well.
Look, her condition is quite delicate.
We shouldn't trouble her.
Okay, granny, we
promise that we will stay.
As long as you say. Now come out.
We'll do that as well.
Just a minute, baby.
Hey, Ira.
- Hi, Nano.
Where is Sid?
- Not in my pocket. Promise.
You are so funny.
- Thank you.
He isn't answering my
calls since a few days.
He isn't coming to
your stupid bar as well.
What's going on?
Sid's a busy guy.
You know nowadays people take
divorce at the drop of a hat.
That's right.
- Sid's business is booming.
He must have gone
somewhere for his case.
But Nano, how is it possible
that you don't know where he is.
It has happened number of times.
I am his friend, not his wife.
You are not, either, right?
No, Nano. I am not, either.
That's why you might
have to pay a heavy price...
...for acting smart with me.
Tell Sid that I want
to talk to him urgently.
He should just pick up
the phone and call me.
Get it?
- Sure, ma'am.
Okay. Wonderful.
Bye.
We...
- Granny.
I just saw Mark's phone.
I don't think Mark has
told her where we are.
She is after Mark.
- I know her every well.
She is very clever. It won't
tell her long to get here.
That witch.
She has ruined my Mark's life.
Granny, that's why I saw
we should quickly start...
...that plan you have
made of rekindling...
...the love between Mark and Maggie.
When should we start it?
Tomorrow morning, from church.
Where Mark and Maggie got married.
You know Sonali, this church
is very special for our family.
Last four generations of Pereira
family got married here. - Wow.
Both of them wrote their own vows.
Wow.
- Really?
What were the vows?
During their wedding they
made promises to each other.
Remember, Mark and Maggie?
Mark. Maggie. Come.
Come here, darlings. Come.
- Come.
Good.
Mark, say your vows.
It will be a
rehearsal for Sonali and Sid.
This is how both of
you were standing, right?
Mark, your vows?
I perhaps won't be able
to keep you always happy.
I might sometimes not be able to
understand what lies in your heart.
Actually, I'll not be
able to understand...
...what lies in your
heart a number of times.
But... one sign from you...
...and I'll keep all my
happiness and thoughts aside...
...and agree to whatever you say.
I'll listen to only
what lies in your heart.
I give my heart... my life to you.
Because you... know what
I want more than I do.
Maggie, your vows.
What had you said?
I know you aren't the
perfect husband material.
But for me...
there cannot be anyone
more perfect than you.
I know you don't share
your feeling with anyone.
Sometimes, not even with me.
It's okay.
I promise that I'll understand
everything without you saying anything.
Today I hand over my
trust and faith to you.
I know... I have your heart.
And I promise that I
will... I will take good care of it.
Wow.
"Your image still lingers in my eyes."
"I cannot distance myself from
your memories even if I want to."
"Your presence can be felt
even after you have left."
"Why do you dwell in
my heart as a desire?"
"Why do I think of you?"
"Why do I end and then
I exist once again?"
"Where have you brought me?"
Isha, what medicine should
one give to make someone vomit?
No, no, no. Not to stop vomiting.
To make someone vomit.
To make someone vomit. To induce it.
Okay. Thanks.
Sure?
I'll tell you later.
See you later. Bye. Bye, baby. Bye.
Hey, Mark. What are you doing here?
Nothing. Just like that.
Hey, now I get it. You can't
sleep because you are hungry, right?
Because of no dinner.
- True.
Idea. Maggie.
- What?
When nothing helps
Maggie comes in handy.
What do you mean?
Give me two minutes. I'll
make Maggie noodles and come.
I'm also hungry. Okay?
Don't go anywhere.
That's really kind of you.
- Hey, no problem.
Two minutes.
Hey, Mark.
- Thanks, Sid.
That's for you.
- Thanks, Sid.
Smells good.
- Yeah, nice.
So when are you and
Sonali getting married?
It's complicated?
- Yeah.
Sid, if you love Sonali,
don't let her go.
Yeah, Mark.
And you too.
Maggie is a lovely woman.
You are very fortunate, I think.
Yes, that's true.
I am very fortunate.
Anyway, Sid, thanks again.
The noodles were great.
I'm feeling much better.
Yeah. This is what is
special about Maggie.
Let's go.
Yeah. Maggie to the rescue again.
Come, give it. I'll do it.
You sure?
- Yeah. I had a nice time.
Thanks. Take care, Sid. Bye.
- Goodnight.
Job's done?
Yes, 90% of it is done. Only
one thing needs to be done.
It all went according to plan.
Hello, Dr. Kelkar? Sid here.
Nano's friend.
The one who had a fracture
at a strange place. Nano.
Yes. Yes.
Dr. Kelkar, I am in Goa
right now and I need your help.
Hi. Feeling better?
Okay, good news.
Doctor said it's nothing serious.
There is nothing to worry about.
Still he wants you to
go for a blood test.
Hence he is sending someone
from the lab to take a sample.
Okay? Take care.
Thanks.
Nano, please. Just listen to me.
If you are saying that
Ira has come to meet you
then it means that she
can come to Goa anytime.
I know her very well.
I also know what she will do next.
I have made all the arrangements.
The three of you come to Goa
immediately. Did you understand?
Alright? Bye.
Coffee.
- Goddamn it.
I had lost my mind.
Why did I listen to Ira?
Look at what I have done.
She is such an evil woman.
And you know what the worst part it?
I did all this and you are
the one who has to suffer.
Are you done with your speech?
You don't need to be a hero.
Anyway, both of them are
never going to forgive you.
Please, at least forgive me.
You know I really regret this.
I am... I am really sorry, Sonali.
I am sorry.
Done.
Thanks.
So, when are you proposing?
Sorry.
It's a plan, Sid.
Granny told me that...
...Mark had proposed Maggie
grandly on her birthday.
So, what's tomorrow?
Sunday. And it's also your birthday.
Right. So did you get it?
No wonder you are my partner.
Let's do it.
"I don't know whether you
are the one I desire..."
"Or the one I love."
"I don't know whether you
are the one I desire..."
"Or the one I love."
"This is all I know..."
"I just ask for you."
"This is all I believe in..."
"That I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"Fame or money
cannot give me divinity."
"Fame or money
cannot give me divinity."
"They cannot get me
freedom from loneliness."
"The world has a right over me."
"But I have a right on your dreams."
"No one other than me can see them."
"I don't know whether it's a right..."
"It's a right. It's a right..."
"A right or a daring."
"This is all I know..."
"I just ask for you."
"This is all I believe in..."
"That I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"Need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
"Need you."
"I need you."
"I need you."
Hi, Mark.
Mark, where have you been?
Darling. I missed you so much.
Ira. Ira, please.
What? I missed you so much, baby.
Or should I say the father of my baby?
I had told you that that night in
Greece was so special. Remember?
Ira. Ira, listen. This is not the...
Mark, listen to me. You
are going to be a father.
Aren't you excited?
Maggie. Maggie.
Maggie.
Maggie. Maggie. Please.
Please. Please. Please wait.
Please. Please relax.
I want to say something very
important. Please bear with me.
Mark, I have a confession to make.
Mark, I created the misunderstanding...
...and made both of
you fought in Greece.
What?
Mark, that night in Club Medusa, I
sent Sonali as Maggie Pereira...
...and organized for a hot number.
Maggie had left that
place long before.
Sid.
- No. Stop, Sonali.
I had called the masseur to your room.
I had planted the condom in your room.
You can hit me as much as you
want but let me finish, Mark.
Listen to me. - Mark. - There
must be a reason for it, right?
Mark!
- You cheat! - Mark, stop it.
There must be a reason for it, right?
How could you do this?
- Sid.
Mark, there must be a reason
for it, right? - How could you?
Mark, please. There must
be a reason for it, right?
Stop. Stop it, Mark.
There must be a reason
why I separated you, right?
I am sorry, man, but...
Would you like to tell,
my dear ex-wife?
Yes, Mark. It's true that
Sid is my ex-husband. - What?
But perhaps they both didn't tell
you that they are divorce experts.
And Mark... Mark.
Ask Maggie how much she has paid
them to get a big alimony from you.
What rubbish!
What?
- What? - Ira, what nonsense is this?
Excuse me, Mr. Pereira.
- Yes?
I think you guys already know.
Why? What happened?
No, we got Mr. Pereira's blood tested.
We have got its report.
Why, Doctor? What
happened to Mark? Is he alright?
Who are you?
I'm pregnant with Mark's child.
But is Mark alright?
What?
Mrs. Pereira is... She...
Oh. This was bound to happen.
Why don't you come to the point?
What is the problem?
Mr. Pereira, you...
You are HIV positive.
Mrs. Pereira, we need to
test your blood. And yours too.
No, I don't want to
get my blood tested.
Look, we will have to start the
treatment immediately, please.
But I am absolutely alright.
Look, I can understand.
People don't accept
it in the beginning...
...but everything works
out fine, later. - No, but...
Medical science has
made so much progress.
We won't let anything happen to you.
- Listen to me.
Many a times in youth one makes...
What nonsense are you talking about?
I am not talking nonsense. Who
is a doctor here? Me or you?
Have you lost your mind?
- Please calm down.
Someone get some water.
Yes, but when I haven't
slept with him then how can I...
Exactly.
Madam, it was his test but you failed.
Get out.
Get out.
You lost so much blood.
Do something. Here.
It hurts. It hurts.
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Ourjob is to get the people who
are in a troubled marriage, divorced.
We shouldn't have done
what we did with you.
Couples like you are very rare.
You guys make marriage look good.
Take care.
Good timing.
Maggie.
I am really sorry. I
shouldn't have done this.
I am feeling really awful.
I hope you can forgive me.
It's okay.
Mark.
You rascal.
- Oh God.
You hit hard. I got scared.
Their love story is back on track,
but what about yours?
Go. Get her.
Go. Go. Go.
- Go. Go. Go. - Go, Sid. Good luck.
Hey.
Sonali.
Congratulations, partner.
Our first case was successful.
First?
Yes, now we will
stop splitting couple,
we will instead get them together.
By the way, there is a
very important case pending.
An idiot got influenced by the
vamp and broke his heroine's heart.
We will have to
anyhow get them together.
Sid, what do you want?
- You.
After 26 flings, 6 affairs...
...and a very bad marriage
I have found my soul mate.
I won't let go of you so easily.
Take this.
Come on, check it out.
I've heard that things written in
blood have greater impact in love.
I was anyway bleeding. I
thought I shouldn't waste it.
You are such a pain in the bum, Sid.
Bum?
- Heart.
It's bum for you, right?
Yes.
You have hurt me a lot over here, Sid.
Look Sonali, you are
looking for a prince charming.
And I am no where close to that.
You are a fitness
freak and I am a freak.
I cannot think of
anything other than food.
I accept it.
You are near perfect
and I make mistakes.
I stray.
In short, I am full of imperfections.
But Sonali, that's the
beauty of the whole thing.
I agree that we make a strange pair.
What can be more odd that I
am proposing to you now...
...whereas you are already
wearing my engagement ring.
No, Sonali.
Sonali.
Sonali, please. Listen.
Sonali, I am sorry.
You...
I love you, too.
Come here, you... sexy woman.
Listen.
Never ever remove it. Got it?
I really love you.
Let's go.
- Where?
Home.
- Whose?
Yours. I have a
lizard at my place, right?
One lizard is right in front of you.
Not a lizard.
My prince charming
