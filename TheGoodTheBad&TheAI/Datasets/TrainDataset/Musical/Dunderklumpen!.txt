DUNDERKLUMPEN!
It was midsummer's night
in the northern Jämtland.
And where all is silent.
A night when the sun never sets
and it is always light.
Peaceful.
Peaceful and quiet!
And this was an island
in a beautiful lake.
A land where anything
could happen!
What an extraordinary night!
Fantastic, isn't it?
Want some coffee?
Yes, nothing could be better.
Oh, my back!
Say...
Did you pick some flowers?
No, there were so many bees
gathering nectar among the roses,
I did not even got the chance
to pick them.
- How many bees are there?
- We'll get lots of honey this year.
They're so soft that you must
touch them. There backs, I mean.
The coats they wear.
It would be so nice to touch them.
Have you been upstairs to check
the children?
Camilla is sleeping like a baby.
It is 23:00 already.
- Where is Jens anyway?
- 23:00?
That's because the summer's night,
it remains a long light.
It is an extraordinary night
indeed.
- Hey, I think...
- I should go to search Jens.
Jens!
Where are you?
Come here!
Jens!
Look at this!
It's a bumblebee.
I see.
Must be the sugar
you are looking after.
There you are, little bee.
But hold on a moment!
It would be much better
with some juice over,
to make it tastier.
Help yourself.
He is hungry.
I just want to feel
his warm fur coat.
It's so soft.
Finally.
Finally, I get to play!
What a darlings all.
I don't know what should I choose.
What a nice guy!
My heart is beating!
You made me alive.
Hello, I am Dunderklumpen.
At first Dummy thought...
he had to do with a big carrot.
Oh dear, oh dear.
I think you are so funny!
I will take you!
What a fine teddy bear!
I will first breathe some life
into you.
I'm so happy...
and all I can say...
it's how do you do...
today.
And you are the cutest of all.
You think he hurt himself?
No.
A little attempt to run away.
I think your pants are too long.
Come, come.
Come along, dotted lion.
Do you think he's going
to steal us?
If I did not have very cold arms,
I climbed out of the bag already.
Oh, what a pretty doll!
Look little Doll,
there is plenty of room in my bag.
Come along
and you can sleep in my bag.
I will not.
Come, sleep in my bag.
It's nice there.
No!
- Yes. Come on.
- No!
Yes.
I will not!
I will not come!
Say yes like a good girl.
Come on now.
Or else I'll have to use force
and I am very, very strong,
you know.
O, dear!
I want cookies.
Yeah, well, I have
a delicious cake in my bag.
Oh, no.
There is not.
It's true. There is.
I do not believe it.
I think I'll have a look.
Oh, watch out...
But what is that?
What can it be?
It looks like a treasure chest.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Jens!
Jens!
It is very late!
Jens!
I want you to come home now!
Camilla's already down to sleep.
Hello!
Hey, where are you taking us?
- Jens!
- Camilla! Jens!
Camilla!
We are kidnapped!
We do not want it.
We want to go home!
Camilla!
Help!
We do not want it.
Get us outta here!
Jens, where are you?
Later it will cool down.
Jens!
Hey, winged friend.
What brings you down here?
Shouldn't you be with your friends
on the flowers?
No, I'm a poet.
I was heading south when I went
forth and went north course.
Before you go,
would you fly up
and look for Jens in the woods?
Fly up?
I've only just arrived.
Okay!
You have the sweetiest,
most delicious kind of food I found.
So just for that I hang around.
Oh, what a boat!
With that seesaw
I will get seasick soon.
Chief! Chief!
I saw them.
I saw a mysterious boat,
with some weard creatures in it.
And Jens was chasing after them
with his goat on a raft.
- Follow me quickly.
- Okay.
Everything happens to me!
Jens!
Come back.
Jens!
Wait a minute.
Jens!
Jens!
Wait!
Jens!
I am coming!
Jens!
What are you going...
I'm coming to get you.
Bring back those toys!
There are mine and Camilla's!
Jens!
Wait!
Come home! We are going to do...
funny things,
then we make pancakes...
and you may stay up late.
Jens!
Jens!
Wait right there.
Where are you going anyway?
Hey!
Hello.
You!
Who are you anyway?
Who, who, who, who, who,
who are you?
Dummy thinks he's Santa and we're
the gifts he carries in his sack.
Lucky child who gets me.
I want ice cream, I want ice cream!
I want some, want some, want some!
Ice cream in the woods!
What an experience!
This could be dangerous!
What if he's after my pants?
Without my sensational pants,
I'm nobody!
I know just where we are!
or the other way round.
I put this thermometer in my mouth,
I feel my pulse
and it is 2 million degrees.
And that's how I can tell
that I am nuts!
And who are you?
You must be nuts to carry us all.
You are a funny one.
You really are.
Who am I then?
I'll tell you who I am,
I'll tell you.
I am Dunderklumpen
from Mount Dunderklumpen.
As nice as apple pie.
Never hurt a fly.
Never did know why
I was so lonesome.
And when I was alone I would try
and cheer myself with music.
Loneley Dunderklumpen
looked for songs to hum when
no one came around
always played a clown.
Now with friends I've found
I can't get lonesome.
Why have I brought you here?
Because I wanted to have
some friends.
Listen,
could I dance with you Lionel?
And may I dance with you Doll?
First tell me who are you.
What did you do all your life
when you were all alone and lonesome?
Well, I'll tell you,
but first I'll need an orchestra.
Pellegnillot,
you can play the harmonica.
And you Doll, you can play
the spider web.
That's it. And Dummy can play
the nails and the hammer.
And you Lionel,
you can play the saw.
Bravo Lionel, bravo!
And I can play the conductor
and dance!
I am now 42 years old
but I can think back
to when I was two
or 10 years old, or 32, its simple!
Understand?
No? Well...
What I mean is
I'm still everybody
who I once was.
Yes, really.
There are times when I feel
Oh, really.
And other times I giggle
just as though I were 5 years old.
Oh, really.
And sometimes I can whistle
the way a 3 year old tries to do it.
Oh, oh, really.
And there're times that I can break
a branch like a 30 year old!
Oh, oh, really.
And times I shoot a slingshot
but I aim it like a 10 year old!
And I can shout:
take cover, take cover!
Just like a 40 year old.
And then I can play
with a teddy bear
and fight with one as well.
Do you understand it now?
Do you? I mean,
I'm still everybody I once was.
That's what it was like
when I was all alone and lonesome.
And I played by myself.
The 5 year old has remained
in the 42 year old.
Yes, I was 42 different people,
one for every year that I lived.
Because I was so lonesome,
so lonesome...
But now I have all of you,
I'll never again be lonesome.
Sing with Dunderklumpen.
Shake your happy rump and
play an instrument.
Dance until you're spent
to your heart's content
with Dunderklumpen.
When you're in a slumpin'
Play with Dunderklumpen.
Go out in the sun,
foolish ears are done
when you're having fun
with Dunderklumpen.
Hey there, boy!
I'm one of the flying
bumblebee police.
Can you stand on two hands?
I can stand on one hand.
You know...
Well, I should be
a police helicopter.
Bee police calling the chief!
Bee police calling the chief!
Here he is!
Jens!
Are you there?
Yes!
But I musn't lose them now.
They must be nearby.
I've heard them singing.
I have to hurry.
Chief! Chief!
Hey, bumblebee!
Did you find him?
Well, naturally.
- That way?
- Wrong.
- That way then?
- Right.
Thank you.
You're welcome!
You really have to get moving,
chief.
Uh, wait!
Wait a second!
Look at this tree here!
Now you are going to see a great
international circus attraction.
What are you going to do,
Dunderklumpen?
- The Dummy wants to go on.
- No, Dummy.
I've just changed my mind.
Go on, Dunderklumpen.
Hold on to the branch,
Dunderklumpen.
Go on, go on, go on!
He didn't hold on to the branch!
Jens, stop playing hide-and-seek!
What?
Did you hear that?
Someone was shouting.
Where did that come from?
I can't stand anymore!
Stop!
Lions hear very well.
It comes from that way.
Then we'll go this way.
We'll escape over the lake.
They mustn't catch up with us.
Jens!
Jens!
Yes.
Here it is.
And there are so many fish.
A whole mountain.
Graylings and salmon trout.
How beautiful!
But now kids, we must hurry.
Do you see a log anyplace?
Pellegnillot is standing on one.
We'll take in.
The Dummy can really feel
the high seas.
Once there was a sailor
with clothes that sailors wear.
His name was weird
but never knew it anyone.
Miracle was that he knew it.
You have to be quiet, Dummy.
Remember now that they mustn't
hear us. Whisper.
A sailor loves the waves that rock,
his ship will never perish.
A storm can shake a boat in dark
when he stands in front
of the storm.
Farewell,
farewell,
farewell, dearest Jens.
We will meet again some time.
Farewell,
Farewell,
Farewell, dearest...
chest.
We'll meet no more, goodbye.
Farewell, farewell,
o, loveliest of bears.
Astronaut Pellegnillot
now at the bottom of the lake,
thinks he's on a moon mountain.
Hey, just wait there,
I'm coming get you.
Oh, help!
He's catching up with us.
He'll take you away from me.
Let the toys go,
there are mine and Camilla's.
Hey there, Jens!
Here we are!
Well, what do you know?
I have a bite.
What in heaven's name!
Is it you?
And you actually got
the treasure chest back.
But now we must hurry.
I want some icecream.
Please, Dunderklumpen.
I want some icecream.
I want some, I want some,
I want some!
Jens!
Jens!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
What!
They need me.
This is
the helicopter towing company
at your service.
Pull!
Pull!
And here we go.
Hold on tight, chief.
I don't want you to fall down.
Not so fast!
Slow down!
Caution!
Children, you know how happy I am.
True friends worth gold.
Dunderklumpen.
And he's got a treasure chest.
It makes you wonder
at what he needs it.
I have to steal
that treasure chest.
It will be hard.
That's my money!
That's my money!
Hey! One Eye,
I thought that all this money
is falling from heaven.
Do you like money?
Would you like to have
a lot of money?
I think so.
Then have some.
Have as much as you can catch.
Yippie!
What a bunch of money!
Grab as much as you can.
Take all you want.
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Take as much as you like.
A thousand thanks.
Thank you!
Out! Out with you!
Help me pick up the money.
You can't see the forest
from the money.
I'm gonna take it all.
Pellegnillot, pick up the money.
Yeah, I am doing that.
I've already a thousand million.
Listen, Doll.
My poor arms are frozen.
Help me pick some.
Is this playing money?
Or is it real?
I've already gathered ten kilos.
The Dummy thinks the're berries
and he's going to pour jam
out of money.
Dunderklumpen!
Now we can buy anything we want.
What? We get a town,
we can buy...
you can have a whole ice cream van.
And... and I'm going to buy
a chocolate factory!
The treasure chest.
Good morning...
dumbheads!
They do not hear me.
And Dummy thinks
this is a handkerchief.
Here's to poor me.
It is very cold.
Money drives you all crazy.
Goodbye.
Money, money,
how creepy everyone gets.
It's snowing summer snow.
It's swirling down,
it's swirling around.
It's snowing money.
The money!
Fools!
Hey, there!
On midsummer night,
we love to take flight.
Not on the broom,
but with an umbrella.
Hello, kid.
Let's see...
I mean...
How fast...
can you run a hundred meter?
In eighteen seconds,
I would say.
That is great.
Do you think I can run faster?
Not so.
I think it takes me
about six minutes.
And by the way, something more.
You know what?
How far can you throw that stone?
That is great.
That throw I'd ever seen.
Think I can throw farther?
That's the farthest I can throw.
And, uh... how high
can you jump on two feet?
This jump I'd ever seen.
Could I jump higher?
You win again.
Look here.
Two slices of bread
with ham and butter.
You can have one if you get dirty.
To get dirty, madam?
You can't mean that.
Madam?
My name is Blossom.
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes!
You have to make a mess.
Understood?
Yes, I got it.
Wipe your mouth at your arm
and your arms to your face.
Can you whistle?
Do you want me to whistle?
You laughed. There is my music.
My music.
Well,
now you're all cheered up.
But why were you sad?
A thief has my treasure chest
and the Dummy and Lionel...
and Pellegnillot and the Doll.
And all those mosquitoes
were chasing me.
Then I came here.
And now I'll never be able
to find them all.
Of course you will.
Come on! I know what to do.
We must think and listen.
We'll ask the waterfall.
Come on!
How can know the waterfall
from the mountain?
Not so loud.
He can hear you.
Oh, small lake,
with such a beautiful waterfall.
Listen.
Waterfall.
Good morning.
What do I hear?
What do I hear
is a beautiful flower singing.
Waterfall.
Good morning.
What do I hear there
my beautiful flower?
I sing a song my clean rock
at the edge of the waterfall.
I wanted to ask you something.
- How sweet of you.
- It would be an honor.
Say it once, what do you mean.
The boy?
Is about Dunderklumpen.
What?
Dunderklumpen.
Waterfall.
Where are they?
Who? What did you say?
I did not hear so well.
It was... Dunderklumpen.
Dunderklumpen!
- Maybe...
- Yes?
Maybe you can tell me.
Waterfall.
Where are they going?
Dunderklumpen... yes, yes,
to the giant mountain and...
and also Dunderklumpen
and the others are...
Thank you.
Yes, yes.
That sweet clean rock
at the edge of the waterfall.
- Are you thirsty?
- What?
Are you thirsty?
I do!
There is water in abundance.
Thank you.
Forget it.
Blossom.
Goodbye.
I now know the way!
Come, Jens!
Follow me!
Follow me to Bird Mountain
and I show you where everybody is.
Hey, there! Hello!
Here I am.
Here you have a good view, Jens.
Look out over the world.
Look carefully.
There.
There is Dunderklumpen
and all your friends.
And over there.
There's your dad looking for you
with the help of the bee.
And there...
there is One Eye riding
his bike.
He got the teasure chest
by tricking Dunderklumpen
with a lot of counterfeit money.
Look! One Eye is getting away
on that timber float.
Dad! One Eye has stolen
the treasure chest!
He's on a timber float,
over there.
Jens?
He sits on that timber float!
What?
Timber float?
Hurry up, chief!
There is a boat down at the shore.
Get him, dad!
Get him, dad!
Can your father catch up
with that timber float
and get the treasure chest back
from One Eye?
Do your best!
Dad can't handle this alone.
I have to help him.
Goodbye, Blossom.
Hurry now! Go ahead!
Your daddy is waiting for you.
Stop!
There is a thief on the float.
Stop!
There is a thief on the float.
Be careful Jens, don't fall!
Do you have to keep
that goat with you, do you?
Don't talk! Please, let hurry!
I can see the treasure chest.
That is really awful.
They are about to catch me up.
- Faster, daddy! Faster!
- I'm doing my best.
Faster! Here is One Eye.
Faster!
I can't row... any faster.
Go on! Go on!
- Well done, dad.
- It has broken.
Those fools. Look at that.
Now I feel safe again.
We'll get you anyway, One Eye.
But... but what was that?
Look, there is a crow there.
Let go!
That's mine.
Stupid crow.
Let go, I say. That's mine,
you silly crow or eagle.
Whatever you are,
give it back to me! You...
You... Help!
Stupid crow...
Annoying stupid chicken.
Help!
We'll get back that treasure chest.
I'll get it, just wait.
It goes better with one oar.
Put me down!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Put me down!
There now.
That's seems to be everything.
Thanks Doll, Pellegnillot,
Lionel and Dummy.
Now we go home to my house.
Jens, wait a minute.
Listen.
You and the goat better go that way
and the bee and I the other way.
And we'll meet again
at Jorm Mountain.
Thus we'll find the treasure chest.
See you!
See you, boy.
We're the richest in the world
so shout it
singing loud
so there's no doubt about it.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
You know what?
I'll never sleep as long as I live.
We shall only play
and dance and sing!
Tea for two and you for me.
That's all wrong!
Sing after me.
We're the richest in the world
so shout it
Singing loud
so there's no doubt about it.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
Look at that! Real people.
I don't believe it.
Don't be afraid.
Come closer. It's me.
The Dummy thinks that house
just talked to us.
I did. I can talk.
Who said that?
Somebody has just talked there.
I did.
Was that you Pellegnillot?
No, it was me, "The House".
Do you know what? That's crazy,
that house did speak to us.
We have no time to waste,
we must hurry up now.
No! Please stay!
Please.
It's been a hundred years
since anyone has passed this way
and I had no one to talk with.
I'm so lonesome.
Yes, yes, yes. Come in.
Come in. Be welcome!
All right, Lionel. That's exactly
what Dummy would do.
Go on in, Lionel. You're afraid?
Open the door!
Be it ever so humble
just how I love sweet home.
Just you.
How nice!
How nice to have someone
stand on the floor.
Lionel, don't be afraid. Go in.
Yes.
This is how I look like.
And this is all the company
I have.
So please come in
and stamp on the floor.
It was so long ago.
Yes, you come in, too.
Come along, Lionel.
I'm sorry.
There are so many of you.
Here we go then.
The Dummy thinks
there is Lionel canned here.
Is there really Lionel canned
in this can?
You're dumber than the dumbest
rabbit I've ever known.
Opening a can at both ends!
I didn't know
canned food could talk.
Here, canned food.
Allow me to help you.
How happy I am.
I think is canned rabbit
in this can.
Dear canned food,
I'll serve you with fried potatoes
for Dunderklumpen's dinner.
How funny they are.
You are the best of house of man
and we shout it.
Singing out
so there's no doubt about it.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
And wonder of joy storm on Jorm.
Dunderklumpen's day is on thursday.
Clap your hands
and let your buttocks bumping.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
A wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
Something is burning!
And Dummy says it is a fire.
See?
It's a fire!
Run for your life.
What an experience!
I swim.
Do not worry.
I'll save you.
Wait, don't leave me all alone!
We have to wait for Lionel.
What a terrible accident.
Lionel where are you?
Come!
I saved you all!
I saved the old house!
I have put out the fire.
That was clever, wasn't it?
You are the most handsome lion
in dotted pants of the world.
Come now,
we have to get the others.
Wait! Don't run away from me.
Come...
Come closer.
That's a long time
since I've been touched by a hand.
Come feel
but I am more than scrubland.
Is this really a house that talks?
Yes, I can talk.
The house can really talk.
Yes, that's right.
You are welcome to look
further inside.
Yes, I come.
Yes, cozy,
it looks like a doghouse.
But you can talk inside
and it can be very cozy.
Yes. So, it is that.
Yes, because I can talk,
I am not so alone.
Dunderklumpen and his friends
were here.
And they were dancing and stamping
so I thought they would stay.
But a fire broke out
and they went away.
- But where are they now?
- They went that way.
- Over there?
- Yes.
Yes, yes.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you, bye.
Then I meet them down.
Are you going to leave me?
Come back.
Come back!
Don't leave me alone!
Come back!
What made the house get fire?
Do you think
One Eye could have done it?
That was such a lovely house!
I put out the fire.
I saved the house.
I bet you half a million
that was One Eye who lit the fire.
We have to hurry now. Let's go!
And remember what I said:
Our wonderland is Dunderland.
Oh, what a wonder.
Yes, but you know what?
We saved the house.
Can we have some candies?
Please!
No, I don't have any.
We are in a hurry.
Come on.
You give me the treasure chest,
then I'll come.
No, not right now.
Yes, now.
- I want it now!
- No.
Yes!
- No.
- Yes!
No, no, no.
This will not happen.
I just want to take a look.
Here, take it then.
She could not catch it.
Now it's my turn.
What an experience!
It's One Eye.
What is he going to do?
He took his hat off.
Is he going to wash his hair?
Look out everybody!
The bravest lion in the whole
world is about to attack.
That's it, Lionel!
Knock him out in the first round!
What a marvelous artist he is.
Watch out! Watch out!
Carefully, my little lion.
Now listen here!
You can get a thump
or you can just give up right now!
Is that clear?
The Dummy thinks that One Eye
really takes the treasure chest.
Oh dear, what a disaster.
He's got the treasure chest.
And the way he runs!
Let's hurry.
We must follow him.
Quickly!
Step on it!
What an experience!
Hold on! Wait for me!
Hold on! Wait for me!
Hold on! Wait for me!
Let's keep going, man!
Watch out of the ditch.
Shift here.
Hello, you clever detective!
Get behind the wheel and let's go.
Drive on.
Straight ahead.
Don't spare the horses.
Right to your target!
Step on the gas!
There is One Eye.
Step on it!
Turn right, turn left.
Watch out to the trees!
Step on the brakes!
Dude, I give up.
They gave him a drivers license.
Watch out!
Here I come and I stab you.
Miss me, miss me, miss me!
Wrong...
Wrong again!
Get it!
I get it, I get it, I get it,
I get it, I got it!
Gorgeous!
I got it.
And they gave him
a drivers license.
A flying patrol is on its way
and hunt so lone.
Hello!
Jens!
I can not see
through the thick forest.
But I do have a beautiful view.
It's crazy.
Hello!
Jens!
Hello!
Dad, where are you?
I am here...
at the waterfall!
Can you hear me?
At the waterfall!
I am Giant Jorm and I like
to bathe here.
To bathe here.
Now that I am here,
I really feel like a dandy.
A dandy.
Now I take a cloud to fix a hat
and look again downwards
to mother earth.
I deep in my toe and try,
it's cold as ice,
how nice for us it's sunny.
It's sunny.
Giant Jorm	is happy
and walks in the sun.
The sun.
With a giant step he runs
the entire forest.
The forest.
Now the cloud flies out of my hand
And look again downwards
to mother earth.
The country is so beautiful
and white.
And you can see the mountains
in the distance from the island.
The island.
Move on, crow.
Go somewhere else
with that croacking.
Malte!
Look there.
Can you see who is there
on the other side?
Do you know who is that?
It's such a sweetheart.
It's the good Mountain Jorm.
We quickly take a look
at the other side.
They all are asleep.
How strange!
What!
Who's bicycling all over me?
Pellegnillot, stay with me.
Oh, dear!
Jorm!
Put me down.
Put me down!
What a mess!
Go away!
No, no.
Malte!
Malte!
My goodness.
You are the greatest.
Thank you, thank you.
Now we'll cross over the lake
and go up into the hills.
My home is there.
Hello!
Wait a minute.
What shall I do with him?
What happened?
Where is the treasure chest?
It fell on the ground somewhere.
But what shall I do
with One Eye then?
Shall I throw him away?
Put him on a deserted island!
Good idea.
A deserted island.
In the middle of the lake.
Where he may reflect
in the meantime.
Good bye, One Eye, have fun.
I'm going away, my friend.
Dad! Where are you?
I am over here.
Here is daddy!
Do you think we'll ever find Jens,
the toys or the treasure chest?
We made a mess of it. Really!
The chief and the bee,
the bungler patrol limited.
You could say that.
Jorm put One Eye separately
to teach him a lesson.
Is it...
Is it Beppe calling?
Jens!
Jump into the boat and go to him.
Malte and I will watch out
on the shore.
One million five hundred
and sixty thousand.
One million five hundred
and seventy thousand.
Dad!
Tell me where are you.
A bungler patrol is lost
or you do know where we are.
We sail for hours in the fog.
Come on, where are we?
We are right here!
All right?
Not so fast.
More to starboard.
Hold down.
I want some ice cream!
We'll fall overboard.
We have landed.
Dad!
Where are you?
Jens!
One Eye stole Pellegnillot
and the treasure chest.
- Stop the thief! Help!
- He has Pellegnillot.
Run! Quickly! Try to stop him.
- Everybody.
- Somebody do something!
What's going on?
One Eye got the treasure chest
again!
Go ahead! Hurry up now!
I'll catch up with you. Go on!
Thanks for all that's been.
Thanks for what's to be.
Thanks for summer soft refrain.
Thanks for wind and snow and rain.
Thanks for all I see.
Thanks that I am me.
Thanks for tears and laughter too.
Thanks for strength
to see life through.
Thanks for all that's been.
Thanks for what's to be.
To be...
To be...
- I'll catch him.
- We'll get you One Eye.
Hold on.
We must help this nice lady.
Did you hurt yourself?
Listen to me now.
Look,
I am Elvira Fattigan.
I see that you're all chasing
One Eye.
You see, I have known him
for a long, long time.
He's not really bad.
I know where he lives.
High up in the mountains,
in a little hut.
I point you guys the way.
Up to the mountains!
Now then.
Where are you Pellegnillot?
Jens, here I am.
Help!
Help!
Be silent.
I beg you, be still now.
Please.
We are coming, Jens!
Wait a little.
Here we are! Here we are!
Here we come with my umbrella.
Grab hold.
Grab hold of my umbrella.
That's it, hold on.
Up!
You are as heavy as lead.
He is not home!
He managed to sneak away.
Look there.
There he is.
Don't be afraid Pellegnillot!
I just save you.
I am coming, Jens.
I'm coming.
Dad, One Eye is on the top
of that mountain.
What an experience!
Jorm!
Jorm!
Why don't they leave me in peace
to sleep?
What do you want now?
You must help Jens.
That little boy there.
Who?
Where?
You must help Jens.
That little boy there.
One Eye has stolen his beloved
teddy bear.
Yes.
Yes, well, you certainly
have made a mess of it again.
Stop!
Don't you touch him.
Don't hurt him.
I'll talk to him myself.
But why you, you're so old.
I know him, so I will go.
Leave me alone or I'll throw
the teddy bear down the mountain.
What an experience!
It's a disaster.
Do you think
that lady can handle it?
I hope so.
What if she falls?
Don't worry.
She was born in the mountains.
Jens!
I asked him to come.
Leave everything to me.
Jens, I'm coming too!
Jens!
I've come with the skis.
Where have you been?
Where have I been?
I was looking for you.
Dad, look,
we have to help Pellegnillot.
Isn't that dangerous?
She's going alone to see One Eye?
She'll soon fall.
Shall we get up closer?
I've known you One Eye
ever since you were a boy.
You were the sweetest, kindest,
most friendly child I ever saw.
You liked everybody. People,
animals and all the nature.
Mountains, forests, rivers.
You loved everybody
and you dreamed to all of these,
One Eye.
But as you grew up
you met people who loved
only material things and money.
Who didn't love all the things
you did.
Money was their only love.
You felt more and more lonely
and so alone.
So alone, isn't it, One Eye?
Money alone
does not bring happiness.
Naturally you were disappointed
in everybody since then.
But there are other people.
Money is important. But...
not as important as people
and animals and creatures.
Creatures and all nature...
and freedom.
Freedom is also very important.
Go ahead.
Now you're free again,
Pellegnillot.
Then your disappointment
turned to anger
and you decided to payback
to all those people
by behaving worse
than you thought they did.
And that started you printing
counterfeit money.
So greedy people
would hurt each other
grabbing for it is it floated
through the air.
Isn't that so?
Then you saw Dunderklumpen
with the treasure chest.
And you tricked him
and his friends with fake money.
So you could kept
the treasure chest away.
To teach him a lesson for wanting
the treasure in that chest.
Elvira Fattigan won't be able
to end this.
They will be sorry
they didn't send me there.
Dummy thinks this is all a dream
so he pinches himself, ouch!
No, it's not a dream.
And now we shall open
the treasure chest.
You see One Eye? There is only
air in the treasure chest.
The air of freedom.
Own air.
Air from others.
Where everyone is attached.
Dunderklumpen also wants
the treasure chest.
And he also do not know
that there is no treasure.
The only thing you see
is a stone.
And you see a flower.
And you see a bird feather.
And the rest is air.
The treasure of a child.
That's his money.
No more and no less.
Is he crying?
So you see,
he's not so wrong and nasty.
Is he really crying?
Is he crying?
Yes!
Of pure happiness.
Elvira Fattigan,
you have the treasure chest?
Yes!
But there isn't any money in it.
What?
There is no money in it?
And there is no treasure either?
Not a penny,
but there are treasures.
There is a cute little stone.
And a lovely little flower.
And a wonderful feather.
And the air of joy and happiness
that gently blows around us.
A cute little stone,
a lovely little flower,
a wonderful feather
and the air of joy
and happiness
that fills all with gladness,
gladness, gladness.
And then whiff a wind,
a joyous wind.
Lucky wind.
Lucky wind.
And Pellegnillot will be glad,
I'll be glad, you'll be glad.
You joyous wind whiff over me,
whiff over mountains, land and sea.
Whiff through the world, a giant
pearl, blow you joyous wind.
Blow!
A storm is blowing over Jorm.
Joyous storm, joyous storm.
A beautiful storm over Jorm.
Joyous storm, joyous storm.
A beautiful storm over Jorm.
Lucky storm, lucky storm.
I reached her side, we nearly cried,
it got so bad we nearly died.
We belt the wind, we shout and grin,
go blowing joyous wind.
Blow!
A storm is blowing over Jorm,
over Jorm, over Jorm.
A kindly wind to chase away
our fears.
It is One Eye's turn,
come on step and dance.
A kindly wind to dry away
my tears.
I'd like to have a turn
and here's my chance.
Blow!
A storm is blowing over Jorm,
over Jorm, over Jorm.
Goodness knows it's really grand
a man can get to understand.
I tell you straight
I think it's great.
I have to stay you slow.
Blow!
A storm is blowing over Jorm,
over Jorm, over Jorm.
Laughing and crying is healthy.
So healthy.
So healthy.
A storm blows over me,
over me, over me.
The magic of the midnight sun
is giving love to everyone.
Who wants to join is welcome,
we live just only once.
Blow!
A storm is blowing over Jorm,
over Jorm, over Jorm.
Do you have the treasure chest,
Jens?
Daddy, imagine, Dunderklumpen
really brought those toys to life.
Yes. Look, the sun is rising.
They really know?
