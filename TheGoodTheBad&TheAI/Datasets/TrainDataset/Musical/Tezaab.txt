who are you? what are you
doing at this hour at my house?
Lotia Pathan sent us.
Today is the last day to pay
the dues. You didn't pay.
we came to remind you.
No need to remind me.
I'll pay when I've money.
You said, when your daughter
will dance on the stage...
... then you will earn
lots of money.
she gave 25 performances but
not one drop of water rained.
Don't talk much. Get lost
else I'll call police.
Listen, shyamlal, if money
doesn't reach by 12 tomorrow,...
... we will ruin your life.
You threaten me,
you rogues....
It's not threatening but
taking your signature.
Complete document will be
written tomorrow, until...
... the blood lasts in your body
and our pen can write.
what are you saying! we have given
both white and black money already.
You want 50,000 more?
I'm sure Mohini won't come for
rehearsal if 50000 isn't received.
- what are you saying! - what's
the matter, Krishnamurthy?
You seem to be worried?
Is everything fine?
He demands 50000 more.- what!
Threatening to cancel the show.
Really!
Rs.50,000 is nothing for an
artist like your daughter.
- You can take it any time.
- This is blackmail!
shut up. This is not the way
to talk to a man like shyamlal.
Go, bring 50000.
You come to my house with Mohini.
I'll give you the money there.
Here is your 50,000.
Count it
I won't do such a thing.
You will repent if the
money is found short.
How can you leave without
a drink?
Let Mohini go for rehearsal.
You join us for a drink.
Mohini, you go for rehearsal.
I'll join you later.
You sit here and drink liquor
while I dance there?
If someone else had said this
I would have killed them.
You won't kill me because your
drinks, gambling are paid by me.
I'm the source of your income.
You have no guts to stop it.
Give me the drink.
You rogue, you said Rohini won't
come for rehearsal unless we pay?
Lock up the old man. Throw him on
the backstage when the show beings.
...to hear his daughter sing.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
Tell me what song do you want?
Tell us where were you?
I was waiting for someone.
who was that?
whom I love.
- whom I plead again and again.
- How? - Like this.
" 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6,
" count up to 13..."
" counting numbers here
I'm waiting for you"
" come O my lover
the spring is here as well."
" Got your message on
the 14th day"
"... saying you will
come on 1 5th "
" not come on 14th
nor on 15th"
" what have you gained by
leaving me longing for you?"
" I waited on 16th too
all dressed up for you"
" Come, O my lover.
" By 17th, I thought
I gave up hopes"
" By 18th, my heart was broken"
" I spent the whole
of 19th crying"
" By 20th, my heart
was broken'
" even then I couldn't
stop loving you "
" come to me O my lover"
" 21, 22, 23 and 24th
have gone by too. "
" 25th and 26th made me
long for you all the more"
" only 4 days are left
to make it a month"
" days turned to weeks, weeks
into months, months into an year"
" come and see the
condition I'm in"
" I wander aimlessly
like a mad person"
" hanging between
life and death"
" feel lonely at nights "
" please come, I'm counting
days for you to come "
- Let go off me. - where
have the goons come from?
Let go off me.
- Greetings, brother.
- Greetings Munnabhai.
sit here Munnabhai.
I saved the money from police raid.
Here is today's protection money.
I sold only 150 bottles today.
so,....
This is the month end. so
no one comes to gamble.
Distance between your life & death
is as thin as sharpness this knife.
Next time you lie, you wont
have hands to be bandaged.
stand straight. Munna takes money
but saves us from troubles too.
Come on quick. Don't waste time.
Pakia, you are still here!
You are on strike or the
railways?....come here.
You are hurt? Had a fight?
I'll tell you.
There is a new gang.
It hangs around Hanuman lane near
station and loots Andheri area.
It bashed him up and
took away his money.
- whose gang?
- His name is Mukut Bihari.
He committed murder in some other
state. He is their gang leader.
- Know his whereabouts? - No.
Couldn't see anything in darkness.
Difficult to recognise in the
crowd dancing in Dandiya...
... in Hanuman Lane.
- Hey, you, come here. - Yes.
- Give me icecream.
- Papa, my earing! - My daughter's
earing is stolen.
Catch him...
My daughter's earing
is stolen.
My bag contained my salary.
He looks rich.
we will be the losers if
he gives away money like that.
Are you tired? Exhausted?
Go to some other venue
or go home.
which one of you
is Mukut Bihari?
He is not drunk!
I've many more tricks to bring out
the rat. who is Mukut Bihari?
You want Mukut Bihari?
Rashid, tell him the address
of Mukut Bihari.
Try again.
I'll make dance now.
Tell us the reason now
for searching for me.
You better get out of this area
and not be seen here again.
I've committed 12 murders.
Munna, you should have
brought a bigger weapon.
Now listen to me carefully.
Else you won't be in a position
to listen to anything for life.
Tell them to drop the weapons.
whatever you have looted
in my area of control...
- Here it is.
- Drop it here.
Move it without much
drama.
There is Munnabhai,
stop there.
Looks like their train has come.
Pakia, get them in. - I'll.
Get in.
Now, put him in the
cattle carriage.
- send him to his native place.
- By train.
Be careful.
They are our guests.
Return all the purses
in the bag.
- Munnabhai... - what's it?
- Telegram.
Munna, come home soon.
Trouble at home.
are looted.
No one knows who did it?
we only know that the gang
belongs to Lotia, a criminal.
Police were after him already.
Don't know where he took Mohini.
Any news about the owners of
the motorcyles found there?
They were all stolen ones.
Message on wireless says an ousted
criminal has entered our area.
- who is he?
- Munnabhai
He was ousted from this area
This is Mahesh Deshmukh!
How did he become Munna?
He is known as Munna in this area.
He had undergone one year
imprisonment for murder.
File describes him as a
dangerous criminal.
My memory says he was a sentimental
but an youth, full of life.
who was ready to die
for his country,
- Do you know him, sir?
-2 years ago....
There was a bank in a quite lane
in front of my police station.
Both his parents worked there.
I still remember the day
I met him for the first time.
Father.... father....
Didn't I tell you that I'll
win the best navy cadet cup?
Yes, mother. The best
Navy Cadet Cup.
- Bless you my son
- lnspector, this my son Mahesh.
Mr.Deshmukh, you have to
distribute sweets now.
- Your son has fulfilled your
ambition. - True.
Let Mahesh fulfil his dream.
- what do you want to become? -Join
the navy and become Admiral, sir.
He always talks of dying
for the country.
He must be a patriot in his
last birth who died in...
... freedom struggle.
Happy to meet you.
I promised to buy you a
cycle. Here it is.
Bye, mother.
we will meet at dinner.
Don't move else I'll shoot.
Hand over the safe keys, oldman.
I won't give the keys.
why do you invite your death?
Take out the keys.
I served this bank for 20 years.
It's my duty to protect it.
I don't care if I have to
give up my life for it.
she's going to bank. she has a
baby! Her life is in danger.
You go and inform the
police on the way.
My parents are trapped inside!
You tell me to go away?
They have guns which can go off
anytime. You risk your life.
The right to fight against crimes
lies with uniformed men alone?
Not us? I've dedicated my
life to the country the day...
... I wore this uniform.
we have to stop the woman and
the baby from entering the bank.
Decoits might shoot you
because of your uniform.
I'll bring her back.
Give me orders.
- Let me carry him.
- May god bless you.
- These days children don't
care even for parents.- Listen...
I've to do all the work alone.
someone save my child.
Take this, sir.
sir, see what they have
done to my mother.
- Mahesh....
- Father....
Let us take him to hospital.
son, I've not got much time.
If you want to do something
for me, fulfil my dream.
Your dream is my dream now.
Don't say so, father.
Entire country is on your side.
Take care of Jyothi.
Father....
The most joyous moments of his
life turned saddest moments.
I've not witnessed such a cruel
joke of fate happen to anyone.
Mahesh left for Bombay
with his sister.
since that day I felt my power
of endurance of pain has grown.
search every nook and
corner of the town.
seal all the exits from the city.
It is essential for me
that this man is caught.
I want to know how he turned
from Mahesh to Munna.
Brother.....
- Jyothi...
- Brother...
what happened?
what's the matter?
Did Lotia trouble you?
No. I cried because I saw
you after an year.
There are 4 more days
left for one year.
I'm still branded as
an ousted criminal.
Police is chasing me
like mad dogs.
You know that I cannot come
back to Bombay till...
... I finished my punishment.
Tell me why did you
call for me?
For Mohini' sake.
- what happened to her?
- Lotia Pathan's men abducted her.
what do I do!
whom do I tell other than
you to rescue Mohini?
There're lakhs of girls in town.
I'm not responsible for them.
Mohini is one in a lakh. she
helped you in saving my honour.
I'm already an ousted criminal.
Don't want more problems.
It is the job of police or
her father. Not mine.
Being her father he can
get her married to saxena.
- Theater owner?
- Yes. He wants to marry Mohini.
so be it. she isn't related
to either of us.
I always considered he
my sister-in-law.
she can never become your
sister-in-law.
I gave her that right until
one of you get married.
Look into my eyes and say that
she doesn't mean anything to you.
You cannot do that.
- You, crazy! Go, get a cup
of tea for me.- I'll.
Don't irritate me more, saxena.
It's all because of you.
Blaming each other isn't going
bring Mohini back.
so, forget your anger and
think how to rescue her.
Help is at your door step.
The dark room where your daughter
is hidden by Lotia Pathan...
... is unapproachable for police.
But my hands can reach.
You, a fresher in crimes
mess with Lotia Pathan!
He will hack you and
throw you in the gutter.
You have gone blind out of greed.
Cannot see the opportunity.
He is talking of my gain!
If I fail to bring her back, one
of your enemy gets out of your way.
Because you think Lotia and his
men won't let me get out alive.
I know that.
I'll bring back Mohini.
You will get back your daughter.
It is to my advantage either way.
If he comes back I get my daughter.
If not, I'll be rid of one enemy.
what do you gain by
risking your life?
Rs.50,000.
A deal to save my daughter!
Get lost from here.
- Think again.
- wait.
I'll pay 50000. Once Mohini
returns we get back everything.
- what if she refuses to dance?
- I take responsibility for that.
I'll clear your debts and arrange
livelihood for you for life.
I don't understand one thing.
He wants money in return for
his favour. what do you want?
with your blessings.
why not, saxena?
I can sell even my blessings
if I get good price for it.
Okay, Munna. It's a deal.
what all you want?
One Hundi Biryani, Kabab,
one Kaleji,...
... one fried fish with
all the accompaniments.
- Understand? - I did.
what will you have?
One Pulao and one icecream.
Brother, you?
It means we need Rs.720 to
celebrate Chandini' birthday.
Do something. My hair is turning
silver because of starvation.
why not use it to buy food.
I've heard of finding hair in food.
Do something, fast.
It looks as if you are destined to
have a feast today! Let's go.
- Clean up the table. where are
you going? - To wash my hands.
sit down. Pick the
pocket of that man.
- He will come to know.
- Did you come to know?
I'll hit you.
They are my boys. Let them eat
what they want. I'll pay the bill.
waiter, bring tea with
less of water.
- I found it first.
- I found it.
This is Bombay. Money belongs
to whoever holds it.
Then it should go to
hotel's kitty.
Cannot we settle it?
we can. You pay my bill.
I'll pay.
Fine.
Get out fast else you have to
scrub and shine the dishes.
My uncle will pay the bill.
Isn't it, uncle?
- I'll pay. Let him go. - Take it
from him. He loves me a lot.-Fine.
Chicken was delicious!
How much is the bill?
waiter, what's the total amount?
Rs.48 for 6 plates chicken.
... and a fainted Marwadi.
we managed for today.
what about tomorrow?
There is no dearth of idiots.
Not difficult to find one.
People better watch their money.
This is Munna's motorcycle!
Munna....
Here is advance. I'll return
the car in 2 days. - Nevermind.
we are glad to see you.
How did you come unexpectedly?
you still have 4 days to go for....
- I had to come.
- For Mohini?
- Yes.
- Lotia's address?
His den is in shaitantekhdi
near Kasarghat.
How did you find out?
All drug addicts know addresses
of all goons in the town.
Buy them drugs they
will tell you.
we have to go well prepared.
- Just tell us when to leave.
- Now, immediately.
- How're you managing? - O rich,
you better guard your money.
sir! Here!
You might have changed
your ways.
I've not.
- what is my crime? - You are
banished means...
... you must have
committed some crime.
That's why society thought you
deserve to be kept away from them.
This same society had once exiled
Lord Rama for 14 years.
what was his crime?
You are a criminal for the law.
Didn't you know the result of
threatening a police with a knife?
I'm ready for more punishment.
But I've to go now, sir.
Let's go, Baban.
Mahesh, stop. My duty tells
me to arrest you.
And shoot if necessary.
- shoot.
- I won't do it. Because,...
I want to know how a patriot
became an enemy of the country?
I forgot my past life.
You've to remember because my duty
isn't just arrest criminals,...
... but to know how youth of the
nation turn criminals, then...
... perhaps, I can save few of
youth turning to crimes in future.
You talk of preventing crimes?
Your police turned me criminal.
- How? - I've no time to
explain it now.
Give me 24 hours time. I'll
surrender myself by that time.
Tell you what you want to know.
Then you can punish me as you want.
I cannot give you time
but can go with you.
Okay.
Now tell me how you happened
to be exiled by law?
I joined college here after
returning from Nasik.
Began working in swimming pool
at Boats Club.
One day I met a girl there.
Her name is Mohini.
Madam, it's time to close.
You haven't got into water yet.
Is there no lady teacher
to teach?
what is wrong with me?
I want to learn only
from a lady teacher.
why do you kick my livelihood?
Kick the water, you can swim.
I would rather drown than
let a man touch me.
As you wish. But I've no
qualms about touching a girl.
Look at her pose!
she prefers drowning than
a man touch her!
Drowning in the pool of
his heart!
You fatso, I'll teach
you swimming. wait....
Help... help her.
Help....
Let us see her condition.
For a learner it is okay.
But a...
...sinking person shouldn't bother
who the rescuer is,a man or woman.
Congratulations for surviving.
- lsn't it time for college?
- There is still time.
- Take us for tea. - sure.
- what happened?
- someone picked mu pocket.
- You have one!
I picked someone's in the
morning.
Let us butter up Guldasta. That
will provide us breakfast & tea.
Beautiful singing!
- we want tea.
- what will you have?
- Your song is satisfying enough.
- You must have something.
- Atleast tea?- Tea is okay.
- what about eating something?
Nothing doing.
sometimes we wonder if your voice
is more sweeter or your tea?
Do you gargle with tea?
someday, some music director will
happen to listen your songs.
You will be lead to HMv studio.
we will sit and listen to
his songs on radio.
- You have a music director
friend. - who?
- O yes. - He arranges
programmes on Tv.
- Gives chance to new comers.
- lntroduce him to him.
- How much is the bill?
- Don't embarrass me.
- I cannot take money from you!
- Then what do you take?
You introduce me to the
music director once.
Old man!
Keep sugar and tea leaves inside.
Remember their dues.
You are forgetful.
There are very few people
who love pure music.
shut up and collect
money from them.
- You may cut it from my salary.
- what did you say?
- Girl in yellow is mine.
- Girl in red dress is mine.
Last year she was yours.
Mine, this year.
- Mine is with blue veil.
- she is sister-in-law to you.
You can only look at
her slippers.
sure. But he has the right
to get beaten up with them.
- welcome.
- what are you doing?
Trying to woo the girls.
That's not your cup of tea.
You can only boast.
- Do it and show me.
- why not you woo a girl.
Bombay girls are
difficult to woo.
Be it any place, girls
are after all girls.
One has to have brains to
woo them.
Munnabhai, in love, one needs
heart not brain.
Do you remember
Anand Bakshi's song?
- Love isn't deliberate
- It just happens.
- Love isn't....
- what is love for....
....you may take my life.
Enough. You watch so many movies
but don't understand that...
... the way situation is created
to make people laugh or cry...
... one can make people
fall in love too.
- You mean any girl can be
made to fall in love?- sure.
This isn't Nasik. Here, you
will be hit with sandals.
It is just psychology.
science of wooing girls.
Be it college or a stage,
method to woo is the same.
Only formulas change.
One has to use a different
formula for each girl.
Explain us about formula.
Different medicine for different
illness but the rest is the same.
It takes long time to woo some
girls, and short time for some.
But she falls for you in the end.
-This isn't enough.- You have to
show us how the formula works.
- I'll, if you bet.-Bet of Rs.100.
- Bet of 100. - Bet.
You know what she said?
she said......
what is the name of the
last year's college queen?
- which class is she in?
- My class.
- And you?
- In Nikita's class.
I mean your sister Jyothi's
class.
so, I've to butter up
Jyothi first.
Tell her to meet me in the
canteen for lunch if you see her.
It's urgent. Bye.
I'm going.
- You took long time. - You
wanted money isn't it? Take.
- Money! when did I ask for it?
- You didn't!
Must be about movie!
Let's go.
You are extra sweet!
what's the reason?
It's your classmate, with
blue eyes, black hair...
... Iast year's College
queen, Nilita...
... introduce me to her,
please.
I'll introduce you to her
but...
- You have to do me a favour.
- Ofcourse.
Brothers and sisters should
help each other.
- Tell me. - she is my friend.
she has some work with you.
- Yes. - I want your notes
on psychology.
If you can teach me personally..
Teaching isn't a problem
but time is.
He is refusing. Boring.
There is Nlkita!
why say sorry?
I really enjoyed it.
Hope you aren't hurt.
- will you please sit there?
- what!
Be seated.
Nikita, this is my brother, Mahesh.
Aren't you the one who got
distinction in psychology?
- I was wondering if you can
teach me. - why not?
- You made my life!
- I don't understand.
I love teaching psychology...
... when the student is like you.
Do you have time?
we have to take out time.
Mohini, it's all over.
Go to Badrinath to pray.
- shall we go? Here is your book.
- what about us?
Here he goes!
Let's go.
Looks like she's waiting for Munna
They're probably going out.
Let's have some fun.
- shall we?
- Yes.
You have a flat.
- Now what do we do?
- No problem. My lndian lmpala.
- we'll go in this.
- sure? - Yes, hop on.
- Ready?
- Yes.
The guy won't look this way.
Must be thinking about Nikita.
Now what do I do?
what are you thinking?
If he doesn't come to save me?
so what? People who die
for love change history.
Jump right in!
Jump, Mohini!
Help!!
Do you come here to practice
swimming or drowning?
One more time and you'll
be an expert at drowning.
Help!
Help!!
stand straight! stand up!
You're in 2 feet of water
- when did you come?
- Just now.
- I teach swimming.
- How many have you drowned?
About 30 or 40..
- How did you come here?
- I haven't swum for ages.
Heard you teach swimming
so I came here.
- sure.
- Can you teach me diving?
I've won 30 odd medals for diving
Raise your arms and dive.
Here comes the pest.
- Finished lunch?
- Yes, waiting for brother.
- May I join you?
- sure. sit down.
we can't enjoy the
food unless you join us.
That is true. we
all have our effect.
Hey, effective monster!
Couldn't you find another table?
Give everybody a chance
If you object...
I thought Munna...
see how she hurts for Munna.
Feed him when he returns
all hungry and thirsty.
- lt'll satisfy both.
- You're exceeding limits!
You're talking of limits!
You're supposed to be my pal.
You talk sweetly to me.
And stick to him like gum!
My cultured background doesn't
permit me to answer this filth
who's asking for an answer?
Not been swimming for long...
Thought I'd start. Can't figure
psychology. Please teach me.
Learn all the psychology you want
for all your seven lives!
And be assured..
If I knew mad girls like you
study in this college..
I'd never come here!
- I'm going.
- where?
I'm leaving the city.
what? You'll leave
because of one mad girl?
I can't face anyone
after being humiliated..
How do I convince you...?
Don't take it seriously.
It's more serious than you think
see you.
- when will we meet?
- Never.
- Not even accidentally?
- No.
Mohini aroused feelings
of love for you in my heart
I controlled it this time
but I might not the next..!
what? Nikita left?
I..I wanted to apologise to her
I said a lot of things
to her yesterday.
what have I done?
I didn't know what I was doing.
I only knew that I love you.
Me...?
Yes. I love you.
And I can do anything for you.
I can't believe that
a girl could love me.
And a girl like you!
Any boy from the college
would willingly kill for you.
Just give me a smile
That's enough for me.
I can't believe the obscure
fragrance of love I sought..
It would be so close to me.
- will you accept me?
- Yes
"Heer grew crazy singing
out Ranjha's name with love"
" Lost in your love, she
neither slept nor stayed awake"
" Recall nothing but your name"
so Babban, got her!
How did you do it?
Not like this.
First hold your ears...
Repeat after me.
- whether Nasik or Bombay..
- whether Nasik or Bombay..
Girls are girls. One must
know how to swindle them.
Girls are girls. One must
know how to swindle them.
One doesn't fall in love
One makes them fall.
One doesn't fall in love
One makes them fall.
Praise to Mother Psychology!
where are you going?
Pay me the 100 bucks!
Pay the money you bet.
- Give it.
- Take it.
- Now tell us the formula.
- Throwing a party at Golden Gate?
- He will..
- Accepted?
Miss Mohini, I wanted to tell
you that Munna is fooling you.
what?
You are being used for
merely winning 100 bucks.
- Toying with your feelings.
- Is this a joke?
If you don't believe me, go
to Golden Gate in the evening.
- see for yourself.
- But you..?
This is formula number 420.
And how it works..
"Aim at one, hit the other"
If you want to flirt with
a girl using this formula..
woo one of her friends..
so she gets envious.
when the iron of envy is hot..
Forget this and tell us
what happened at the pool.
she openly told me..
what?
I really love you.
Then I also responded
- I don't believe it...
- He's crazy
- Then..?
- I flattered her.
I said, I can't imagine
any girl loving me.
specially a girl like you!
Any boy from the college
would willingly kill for you!
- That broad...
- shut up!
she said, just give me
a smile. That's enough.
Then I thought I might
as well do the final act.
Finito?
I held her and said
I was blind so far!
I had no idea the obscure
fragrance of love I sought..
It would be so close to me.
- It's Babban not Mohini.
- so close...
Not in the quest for love.
The girl who stands before you..
This girl who loves you..
You used her like an animal!
You crushed her feelings..
You proved your formula!
You turned my love
into a cheap drama!
You turned out to be one
of those men that I hate!
But the day you learn the
difference between man and beast..
That day you'll hate
yourself the most!
Listen to me..
I've been longing to meet you
To talk to you.
since the Golden Gate fiasco,
I wait for you outside college.
Then I wait outside your
house for you all night.
But you probably never
came out of your room.
Jyoti won't talk to me
and all my pals have vanished.
How and through whom do
I tell you what I'm feeling?
Move aside! since
that day I hate myself!
But I really love you.
I know you are hurt. Badly..
Forgive me!
Let me go!
How do I convince you of my love?
Give up my life? I can
really jump off this building!
Just tell me!
Even if you won't say it,
I'll still plunge to death!
see how risky it is!
If I die, there'll be a problem!
You won't be able to apologise
and will never forgive yourself!
Jump from anywhere
if you want to die.
From a 7 storey building
or the Qutub Minar!
I don't give a damn!
This is love!
This is no joke.
How do I convince you?
I don't want to be convinced!
Don't try to convince me!
Fine.
Move back.
Do you still love me
as much as you did earlier?
Else I'll jump down!
You're wasting your time and mine
I'll count to 3. If you don't
answer, I'll jump to my death!
You may stand there
and count to a 100!
I don't care!
One! Two!
Three!!!
"say that you are mine or else.."
"l want to die not live"
"say that you are mine or else.."
" I want to die not live"
" Don't ever say that"
" Don't ever do that"
"This coquetry kills me"
" I bind you by a promise"
"say that you are mine or else.."
" I want to die not live"
"Yesterday I hurt you"
" I am sorry to do that"
" Forgive me for it"
"This is my first love"
"You are my love"
"This is what attracts me"
" I bind you by a promise"
" Make me one promise today"
" Never again will you be naughty"
"You'll love me
as much as I love you"
" Love me as much"
"The blush spreading on the cheek"
"You are bound by a promise"
"Complaints and protests"
"That's an old story"
" Never shall we be annoyed"
" Now I belong to you alone"
"we'll be together
even if I die"
" Never will we be
annoyed with each other"
"we'll be faithful"
Now we must stop meeting everyday
why? I've heard the wife gets
boring 7 years after marriage.
- You're already fed up?
- Hush.
The exams are drawing close
If I get a first class..
I'll easily get a
commission in the navy.
YOU want to be an
officer in the navy?
Yes. It was Dad's dream.
This job won't just
earn me a livelihood
It's a pretext to be a part
of my country, it's struggle.
And if you become
a traffic constable..?
I'll stop the speed of time!
stop. Miss Mohini is passing!
- shall we?
- Yes.
Have you no shame gallivanting
with street dogs at night?
Abuse me if you must.
Gentlemen don't abuse strangers.
Do gentlemen mislead
innocent girls like you?
Or do you need men now?
You should be ashamed to talk
to your daughter like this!
Despite having a father
I felt like an orphan.
But Munna's touch
gave me solace.
I feel safe with him.
Do you know the position of the
one you want to be safe with?
His father was an ordinary clerk.
He lives in a rented
ramshackle house.
He works at the swimming pool
for Rs. 500 to survive!
Merely Rs. 500!
His friends are all
unemployed vagabonds!
His father was an ordinary clerk.
But he supported his wife
and kids with his earning!
He didn't live off
his wife and children!
He lives in a rented
ramshackle house.
But it's better than this
palace which is mortgaged!
He works for a mere 500
to run his house.
But he's better than those
who are drowning in debt!
His friends are
unemployed vagabonds.
But not alcoholics or gamblers!
Taunting me? If l
drink or gamble...
Does your Pop pay for it?
No, not my Pop.
My mother pays for it!
shut up!
why didn't you go
to the dance class?
- I won't go.
- why not?
I don't want to
because I have to study.
To hell with studies! You
have a stage show in 6 months!
I don't want to do it!
You won't obey me!
Next time you see the boy,
you'll suffer your mother's fate!
This is the collection from
Bhavani Nagar gambling dens
- How much is it?
- Rs. 17582.25
This is from the
MG Road bar, Rs. 35800
And this is from the
police line gambling 17222
- Good. - and this is the
interest from the workers.
Rs. 18000.50
shyamlal, welcome..
sit in the office.
I'll join you soon.
I don't follow...
You neither smoke nor drink.
do you womanise or have cars, homes or any
luxuries.
why do you need money?
Money is my weapon not need.
what is your need?
- I need some money.
- Repay the earlier loan first.
I'll repay it. Just let my
daughter dance on stage...
I'll pay back every penny
Lotiya doesn't depend
merely on his debtor's words.
Lotiya does no favour by giving
And doesn't respect
anything at payback time.
when is your daughter performing?
If it were in my hands,
I'd start right now.
But she has changed since
that boy got after her.
I don't want trouble.
Just live off my daughter
Is that wrong? I can't
help it if I have a daughter
- Tell me.
- You are right.
Go and take the money.
Little Khan!
Give him Rs. 20000
Note it in his account.
who is this guy?
Never seen him before.
- He's my brother.
- I see.
- Great to meet you.
- Just got out of jail.
- Got caught in the Nasik
Robbery Case. - Really?
No justice in today's world.
Getting caught and
released is fine.
I'm not sorry about it.
But sad that he's the first
Khan to become a drug addict.
He contracted this
filthy habit in jail.
I swear I'll wreck vengeance
on the man who sent him to jail!
- who is the wretch?
- His name is Munna.
Mahesh alias Munna whose parents..
..got killed in the
Nasik bank robbery case?
- Yes. - Your enemy and
mine is the same person.
He's the one after my babe
who has made my life miserable!
- You know his whereabouts?
- Absolutely.
welcome. I'm grateful
you could make it.
I've been waiting for 3 days
Never waited for anyone!
Like a fool I stand
here for 4 hours!
You could have called up
or told Jyoti..
This is our last meeting.
I can no longer see you.
- what did you say?
- I can't marry you!
- so I've decided..
- It concerns our lives.
How did you decide all alone?
It also concerns my life
I have the right to decide.
what do you think of yourself?
One slap and you'll forget
all about rights!
Now all this has no meaning.
I am leaving!
I'll rip you to pieces!
And myself too!
what do you think I am?
You walk out of my life
and I stand by and watch!
You rich girl! If I can
die for you, I can also kill!
But no way will I let
you stay away from me!
what is it?
I wanted to see this
I wanted to ensure that
the fear I have of losing you..
Do you also fear losing me?
I wanted to see that
the fire that engulfs me..
whether you too feel it?
I wanted to check if meeting
daily had lessened the fire.
what happened?
Nothing.
who hit you?
Father.
He punished me for meeting you.
That is why I was testing you.
I've left everything
and come to you!
The Hell that I used
to consider my home
Everything I thought was mine..
I've left everything
and come to you.
I have nothing but
the clothes I wear.
I can't give you
a luxurious life.
But I earn enough to
feed the three of us.
And so life will go on.
There must be some reason
for you to take this step.
Does your father want you
to marry another man?
As if he'd do that.
He'll never marry me off.
- why?
- He wants me to be a singer.
He wants to make me dance
on stage and live luxuriously
That's what he did
with my mother too.
she used to sing and dance
on stage. He played the drums.
Then they got married
and he stopped playing.
And got entangled with
liquor and gambling.
Father blew all mother
earned by dancing on drink.
Every time mother cribbed about
it, father shut her with slaps.
Applause on stage
and slaps at home..
..one day gave mother the
strength to leave home.
I won't stay here one minute!
sure, go ahead. An army of
wolves is waiting out for you!
women who have no men. Go!
Only wolves can be found
in a world created by men!
- lnside the house or out.
- But we protect you.
Can't trust him. someday
the wolf at home may sell me...
I'm not so depraved.
As long as your art sells,
I won't have to sell your body.
what about the day
my art doesn't sell..?
Then..my talented daughter
Mohini will come to my rescue
How can my daughter
bear me to be struggling?
My child, don't leave me!
Don't you dare even
look at my child!
Don't you dare step forward!
Do you know what this is?
This is acid.
If you step forward, you'll
have neither art nor body to sell.
You can't do this.
Because I am your shop.
which supports your
drink and other vice
You don't have the guts
to shut down this shop.
I'll show you my guts!!
Mother!
No!!!
when the door to mother's
room was broken in the morning..
she had ended her journey
from applause to slaps.
But her suicide had no
effect on my father.
Mother's journey ended
but...mine begun.
Today, right now I end your
journey from applause to slaps.
Go home and get
Jyoti to the temple.
I'll get Babban and the gang
and make other arrangements.
- But why...?
- why?
silly girl! we're
getting married today.
Today. Now.
shall we leave?
where's Munna?
If brother were home
you'd be in hospital.
Take her to the dock
Come on!
Kidnapped Jyoti?
who were they?
I don't know. My
father must be behind it.
- But where did they take her?
- where??
They mentioned some dock.
You take her to the police
station. I'll go after them!
Help!!
Let go! No!!
But this is not murder.
It's an accident that occurred
while I was saving my sister.
Accused Mahesh Deshmukh
alias Munna...
You'll be glad to know that
according to the medical report..
Your sister was not raped.
Do you mean that when a
bastard is raping your sister..
should you wait till
your sister is raped?
so you can present her
ravaged honour to the court?
The court demands
evidence not arguments!
where were you when your
innocent sister was kidnapped?
In bed with your
innocent sister.
Just the thought of rape
enrages the public prosecutor.
won't he kill when he
sees his sister being raped?
There's no doubt that Khan
was killed by Munna alias Mahesh
But with the young age of
the accused and circumstances..
The court sentences Munna to
On the basis of doubt, the court
sets Khan's accomplices free.
My Lord, this is injustice!
You're punishing innocents
while setting the guilty free!
Is this just?
Don't brand me a murderer!
Don't ruin my life!
Take back your judgment!
Don't leave! Your Honour!!
Brother...
Now what will happen?
I asked myself this
when our parents died.
Time gave me the answer.
How will I live
one year without you?
This is imprisonment.
They might even kill me.
Then what will you do?
How long will you shed tears?
stop crying. You're not
a child to hold my hand!
Learn to live alone!
From whom should I learn?
From life. Life
teaches everything
The season of being
pampered is over.
You have to fight crime,
conspiracy, deceit at every step
I am being sentenced
but you'll be at test.
Just one year?
I raised my brother for
The punishment for killing
him is just one year?
It's very unjust!
Injustice.
In your court the punishment
for murder might be one year.
But Lotiya's court
follows only one rule!
An eye for an eye
and a hand for a hand!
And life for life!
And sister for a brother!
what's the matter?
- They..
- who?
You rascal!
Don't run, scoundrels!
I'll show each one of you!
Cowards!
Before going to prison,
Munna told me..
I must look after you.
That's why I came.
Don't worry. One of us
will remain to protect you.
But we can't be with
Jyoti all day and night.
And Lotiya's men can
do anything at any time.
There's only one cure to
this pain called Lotiya.
shut his businesses.
Lotiya will run away.
How's that possible?
He runs many gambling dens.
Even the cops don't know about
them. How'll we find out?
we'll find out.
son of a gun!
Telling him.
where's the casino in this hotel?
we don't have a casino.
He's asking me to
buy the hotel right now.
Open up a casino
so sheikh can gamble.
- That's not possible.
- Nothing is impossible.
The Arab speaks Telugu!
Brother...
May I help you?
I'll take you to a place where
your dreams will come true.
Come in.
where have you brought us?
This looks like a hospital!
Create the gambling den.
where is the casino?
This is it.
You'll find everything here.
There's a winner on ever table.
How much is at stake here?
About a lakh or so.
Only a lakh! The sheikh
gives a lakh to beggars.
Take us to a bigger place.
He's loaded. Find
a better joint!
Okay. Follow me.
This is our special place.
You can bet any amount.
There's no upper limit.
wonderful!
He says he'll play here.
This is your currency.
It won't do here.
what? This money won't do?
we do business with it.
Our money won't do? - No.
Come to the hotel at 1 1
we'll bring your money and play!
Yes, I will come.
Catch them all! Let none escape.
There's some problem at
JJ Hospital at Dongarwadi
Come fast.
Put all your money here.
Fill the bag.
what are you watching? Go!
Hop in fast.
- Chandi, informed the cops?
- Yes.
Nobody venture out.
Nobody will try to get away.
This means my doubt
was not unfounded.
Nab the rascal!
Run, man! Big trouble!
There's a problem in the ration
shop behind Hanuman Temple.
Come fast!
Run for it!
I've often seen
cops chasing a thief.
Only today have I seen
the police chasing police.
- Give me a lift..
- You fat lump..!
Hurry!
The Chandanwadi police raided
illegal gambling dens yesterday.
They confiscated gambling
machines and illegal stuff.
Lotiya Pathan, the
owner is absconding.
The police is scouring
the city looking for him.
That's the news.
These boys ruined us.
where will we go?
They've plucked you from the
sky and crushed you into dust.
what they did is
Babban's debt to me.
Lotiya Pathan can leave
the world but not his dues.
Babban will pay for it
with every drop of his blood.
Munna always asks about you
when I go to meet him in jail.
He's counting the days
till he sees you again.
will you meet him?
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"
"10, 1 1, 12, 13"
" 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"

" But you didn't peep out

"l was anxious right from

"Didn't sleep a wink on the 1th"
"But you didn't come
even on the 18th"
" I went bonkers on the 19th"
"l left home on the 20th"
"The admirers cry
echoes in the lanes"
Mohini, listen to me!
You're screaming in the library.
"You came neither on
the 21st nor the 22nd"
"when I didn't find
you on the 23rd or 24th"
"Everybody tried to talk
sense to me on the 25th"
"Don't take your life on the 26th"
"l have only 4 days
left in this world"
"A day feels like a week
and a week feels like months"
"Months run into years"
"Come only to see my state"
" I move around like a madman"
" I neither die nor live"
" My nights are lonely"
"Come to me, come on!"
" Be mine for I keep

" 10, 1 1, 12, 13"
saxena is waiting for
you to come for rehearsal.
The other girls have come.
For whom are you waiting?
Is your husband coming by?
That's right! Munna is
being released today.
- He'll come straight here!
- Then he won't go back alive!
- Get ready to go.
- I'll die but not move!
You can die for that rascal
but not live for your father!
- I'll see that you go!
- I won't dance today!
- Your Pop too will dance!
- Let me go!
Your Munna can never
get to this house.
You'll rot here till
you are willing to dance!
Let me see how long your
last without water and food!
where are you barging in?
- wait at the gate.
- Get out!
You'll regret this
when I frame you!
Move out of my way!
Take this money!
Now you'll never get Mohini.
- Don't scream her name.
- Mohini! Answer me!
scream louder!
Now you can't separate
us for very long.
I'll tear the earth apart and
get her even from the netherland!
Munna, you've come?
I knew you would come.
Father said..you won't find me.
But I was confident
that you'd find me.
You must never leave me.
stupid girl!
Munna will never return!
what happened to him?
I heard that somebody
beat the life out of him.
- You are lying!
- Your Munna is dead!
- No! - First his fingers
were chopped off one by one.
I wish you could've seen
there's only a stub no finger.
- No! - Then his
legs were chopped off.
He was screaming, let me go
Don't handicap me!
- One stroke and Munna went
from 5'10 to 3'10 - No!
when the axe landed on his chest
he had only one word on his lips..
- No! - You'd have seen
the blood in his veins...
..flow onto the road
and spill all around.
- I fired him. - why?
- I suffered losses.
Everyone was flattering him!
And eating and
drinking tea for free.
He blew up Rs. 135.
If I see him here,
I'll break his legs!
You're back!
I'm here as a customer.
I'll pay for the tea.
- Here you are
- Okay.
- No snacks?
- Two omelettes.
You'll get neither
tea nor snacks!
Now you owe me Rs. 135!
I was looking for you.
- why?
- You're looking for Mohini.
- Yes.
- I know where she is.
- How did you find out?
- There's a house near my workplace
Mohini is trapped there.
They are back to beat me up.
why don't you kill me?
I want to die!
I want to die!
why don't you kill me?
Like you killed my Munna!
No..I won't dance!
I won't dance! Kill me!
I don't want to live!
I don't want to live!
I plead with you! Kill me!
It's me, Munna.
- Are you Munna?
- Yes..
I thought they'd killed you
How did you know
I was imprisoned here?
Guldasta from the canteen told me
- The singer..?
- Yes.
But..I saw him meet
my father a few days ago.
- Guldasta?
- Yes.
Open the door!
There's something fishy.
It's a trick.
- I'll check.. - No!
- I'll break down the door!
I'm scared.
This year was very difficult.
I can't live without you!
I'll kill myself!
- But how can l..?
- I don't care!
Go away from here!
Go away!
Girl, open the door!
- Go...
- Break open the door.
You've got me in trouble.
I did all for you. I gave you
news about Mohini and Munna.
Got Munna in trouble.
Leave alone Laxmikant Pyarelal,
you didn't take me to a band.
- I'll do it, man.
- lsn't it too late?
Munna escaped from the cops
and now he's on my tail!
why are you so frightened?
In any case, he's been framed
for stealing from my house.
And if you're so scared, take
this money and go to your village
No, shyamlal.
Guldasta will go to the
police station not his village.
Now I'm dead.
sir, don't beat me!
I'm just a singer.
I'll confess.
Actually shyamlal is behind this.
Ask him, isn't it?
Take his statement.
- Come along.
- I'll confess all.
Take a seat.
Now you can guess how
wicked shyamlal can be.
Only last year he..
Inspector, that's Guldasta yelling
Don't yell. This is a police
station not a college canteen.
They're beating him up.
It's all wrong!
we know what's right and what's not
Is this a new law to beat
a witness to take his statement?
Here's his statement.
He confessed to his crime.
Here's the money that he and
Munna stole from shyamlal.
- sir, what's going on?
- shut up!
Lock this thug up.
You took a bribe from shyamlal!
He bribed you!
Did you take the bribe?
Answer me!!
Men like you will ruin this nation!
Ruin the country! Get out!
Hold him back!
Leave him!
I won't spare you!
You want to frame me!
Don't spare the rascal!
- won't spare you!
- Lock the scoundrel up!
You come out!
You son of a bitch!
I'll show you now!
step outside and I'll show you!
I'll show you in here!
Calling me out!
Beating up a cop!
You dog! You will
whip me with your belt!
On the basis of the evidence,
testimonies of the witnesses...
The court has reached this decision
Mahesh Deshmukh alias Munna
went to shyamlal's house..
..on the night of
Feb 14, to plunder him.
He conned the police
and fled from there.
Then on the 15th of Feb, with his
accomplice Abbasali, Guldasta...
They stole from shyamlal's house
The court sentences Abbasali
alias Guldasta to 1 years Rl
and Munna whom the
citiZens of this city fear
..is sent to exile from
the city for a whole year.
During this period he has no
permission to enter the city.
sir, now do you understand
why I don't trust you cops.
But I will be glad to
bring back your trust.
You'll have to pay a price for it.
I can pay any price to
turn Munna back to Mahesh.
Then give me 24 hours.
Trust me so I can trust you.
All right. I'll wait for you.
stop the vehicle.
- How are you?
- My father is your enemy.
He took a loan from you
why are you punishing me?
what does your lecherous
father have for me to take?
You can pay my debt
and his interests.
I have many who will
pay for your beauty.
who will pay off the father's
debts if not his children?
You'll pay the first
installment of my loan.
Be ready.
Finding Mohini in this
sprawling place is tough.
God knows which dark
dungeon she must be in.
Let's spread out in this place.
The one who finds news
of her first informs us.
she's from a good family
Is she's from a good family
are we from bad families?
Are these girls from bad families?
How will I claim the cash paid to
your stepfather unless you work?
I beg you! Let me go!
Let me go! I can't do this!
I'll somehow pay you back!
- what's happening?
- He tried to run away last night
says, he won't lift burdens.
scoundrel! Beating up a child!
- Mohini has been sighted!
- Run!
You stay here. I'll get Mohini.
You dark rascal! Take this!
Is that it? Okay, fine...
Don't let go. Hold tight.
Run with me, kids! Hurry!
she must be around. I'll skin
each of you if she gets away!
You can't get out
of my colony alive.
Of course I will.
And you'll escort me out.
Come on!
Move back! Act smart and
I'll stab the Pathan!
Come on!
Even your foes will
appreciate your courage.
Not a needle can get out of
this place without my consent.
And you're taking this girl.
I'm not taking just the girl.
Today I'll raZe your
city of sin to ashes!
stop him!
what fun! Long live children!
Is that so?
You are now free.
Go back to your homes!
Hurry up!
After this day there's only
one aim of Lotiya Pathan's life.
Munna's death!
Now I won't let you
stay away from me.
Not for a moment!
You have no idea what hell
I went through in this one year!
I never slept a wink.
I got accustomed to fainting
when they'd constantly whip me.
Once I wanted to kill myself
But I didn't because it
concerns both our lives.
Now I leave the decision to you
Take me wherever you want.
Poison me if you want.
But now I can't live without you!
I want to give up everything
The singing and dancing..
That palatial house..
fame, wealth...everything!
Have you lost your mind?
what do you have if not for
your name, wealth, house?
that I must take with me
what...are you saying?
Just what you heard. If you
can't give me a comfortable life..
what is the point of your love?
Is that why you loved me?
If a real father loves
expecting wealth in return.
Have I done wrong
if I also expected it?
- what do you want?
- same as your Pop.
I want you to sing and
dance and make money for me.
- Because I have the right.
- You are lying!
- You are lying!
- That's not the issue here.
This is true.
Living out of bounds with
thieves for a whole year..
I have understood what
the world is all about.
Neither love nor dreams
work in this world.
Even I loved my dreams.
But what did I get?
I thought my dreams
were in my hand.
But I never realised when
they slipped out of my hand.
similarly your Munna
too has changed.
His dreams have changed!
This is also true!
Now he dreams of becoming rich.
Of acquiring every
luxury life can offer!
And he will do
anything to acquire it!
You are lying.
If this were true, why would
you come here to rescue me?
why would you save
your love from ruin?
Do you think I came
here for your love?
stupid girl! I had
a deal with your Pop.
He's promised me Rs. 50000
if I got you back.
- we have a contract.
- You are lying!!
You are lying!
Don't joke with me!
I won't be able to bear it!
say that you were joking!
It's the truth!
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"
"Every destination is asleep"
" Every destination.."
"The roads too are asleep"
"The earth and the
sky are fast asleep"
" Every destination is asleep"
" Every destination.."
"The roads too are asleep"
"when night came, those with
homes went home to sleep"
"while we wandered the
streets and got lost"
"This lane and that.."
"This city and that.."
"where do we go
even if we'd like to?"
" Every destination is asleep"
" Hear my words.."
"say something to me"
" Don't be silent when
you are close to me"
"we are close yet we are far"
"we are free yet helpless"
"why did love change?"
"why did the world
win against us?"
"My heart is clamped by sorrows"
" Life is filled with darkness"
"Only darkness"
"Every destination is asleep?
Old crook, here's your babe!
- Baby is back!
- Pay me up.
- what's that?
- Cash 50000.
Remember or do I have
to jog your memory?
what do you have to remind me?
No point arguing with such a man
- Pay him.
- I must pay him?
- From where?
- I gave you 50000 that day!
saying anyway he might bring
Mohini and we'll have to pay him!
He'll fight if we don't pay.
Didn't I pay you?
Yes but I spent it.
Come back when I have cash.
Enough of your drama. Your
babe is back. Now pay me!
what will you do
if I don't pay up?
This broad will stay
with me till I get paid.
Pay up and take her.
- stop him!
- wait..
I'll pay your price.
Here, count it.
I know your accounts
can never be wrong.
- Call me if needed.
- sure.
You degraded yourself in
Mohini's eyes like this?
Brother, for what are
you punishing yourself?
- what else could I do?
- You could've accepted her.
- she'd get a home and l'd
get a sister-in-law. - lmpossible
I'll do what you
consider impossible!
I'll tell her the truth and
see how you put her off!
Don't be a fool!
You want to give her a home
saxena too can give her a home!
I am in exile. The
cops are on my tail!
I run out of land to flee!
How will I give her a home?
I will be sorry that l
couldn't give you a sister-in-law
- And love...?
- Love will remain.
As hatred in her heart
and a wound in mine.
This is money!
Yes. Now what you have to do
is start a decent business.
something small
but make a beginning.
For many days we had a dream.
we start a small garage.
In one sweep, you made is so easy.
How do we thank you?
Give you one punch! There are
promises no thanks between pals
From today your faces will
be seen in Babban & Co. Garage
Not on the roads!
Promise?
I've kept my word.
The man brought before you...
His crime is not only that..
He broke the order of exile
The book of his crimes is
as filthy as it is thick!
Even after serving a year long
sentence for murdering innocent..
The accused Munna
didn't learn a lesson!
He went to the judge's farm house!
Relation with Guldasta
to steal from shyamlal!
Attempt to kill the
honourable lnspector Gupta!
It seems this man is waging war
against all good men in the city!
Crime and sin is the
only passion of such men!
such killers should be
kept away from society!
Because he's the acid that
will destroy everything..
..if it spills out of
the jar of the prison cell!
Yes, I am acid!!
I am acid.
I admit that I am acid.
But I'd like to ask
where did the acid come from?
I ask you and the
Public Prosecutor..
and every person
sitting in this hall..
How was this acid created?
My Lord, this acid wasn't
created in my mother's womb!
The boy in NCC uniform who
swore to die for his nation..
He kept his promise even
after losing his parents.
That boy was me!
I, Mahesh Deshmukh was not acid!
Julie, get me 1 large.
I wager 500
what's happening?
Nothing, just having some fun.
I too bet 500.
when you have fun in uniform,
what do you do when on duty?
Let me continue.
I've got 3000 on the line.
when duty becomes fun and the
gambler plays with the uniformed..
..instead of being scared..
It's not just a few bucks but
the fate of the nation at stake.
what do you want to prove?
Nothing.
You used police force to
prove a falsehood to be true.
I want to exhibit the same
power to prove the truth.
what truth and what lies?
Look at this belt.
Recall something?
I don't recall a thing.
- see you.
- lnspector, stop!
Everything will
come flooding back!
This belt will bring
back your memory.
I too have a belt.
Merely having a belt
doesn't suffice!
The hands corroded by accepting
bribes and betraying their duty...
They can't lift the belt
forget about using it!
It is your soul, your conscience
that stands before you, not me!
The hands of every traitor
are bound before the soul!
which innocent did
you hit with the belt?
what did you do with him?
I framed him!
- How did you frame him?
- with false testimony!
How did you do that?
- Guldasta's testimony!
- How did you get that?
By beating him.
Your memory is better than
that of a wild elephant!
The memory better remain
intact till we reach court.
That's in your interest.
I've said all that I could recall
Munna..is innocent.
But overcome by greed
I proved him guilty
with lnspector Gupta's
testimony in mind...
The court takes back the
accusations on Mahesh Deshmukh.
And orders legal inquiry
into lnspector Gupta's case.
In spite of all the
injustice you underwent..
This society and
country is your own.
Your father became
a martyr for this nation.
You can't get angry
from it and go anywhere.
what can I do all by myself?
A lot. Everyone waits
for another to take action.
some group or the government..
waiting for that,
nobody does anything.
Branded as a criminal, what's
possible for me in this city?
Not here, in Goa.
My friend has a shipping agency
I spoke to him about you.
Go there and begin life afresh.
Guldasta..? Come in.
How did you come here?
I've come to apologise.
For the first time in life
I realised in prison..
The obsession to do something...
..makes man selfish and blind
His obsession destroys many lives
And he doesn't even realise it.
Neither you nor I can
rectify what happened.
Forget the past.
Babban told me you're leaving
this city to go to Goa for good
This city gave me a name, Munna
Then the same city gave me
another name, criminal!
Released from these names
with a new name in a new city..
I'm going to begin a new life.
Leaving Mohini?
Leaving behind everything
this city gave me.
Friends and foes included.
I won't let you go without Mohini
No way.
Relations hold back a man
and I have no relatives.
There is one relation.
And I will definitely
try to save it.
There's nothing between me
and Munna that can be saved!
No, what remains
between you and Munna...
I've seen it in Munna's eyes.
what did you see?
Lust for money?
For him, I'm now
just a cardboard doll.
He struck a deal with
my Pop to get me back!
And dumped me in another hell!
I'd given myself to him
with such trust..
I loved him to distraction.
But he..he used him
for his selfish motives!
Crushed my feelings afoot!
I hate him! I hate
the thought of him!
That is what he wanted.
That you hate him.
He knew you loved him
as much as he loved you.
Till he falls in your eyes..
till he becomes a
victim of your hatred...
You won't marry another.
He could bear to see you
a princess in saxena's palace.
But he didn't want his Mohini
to wander with a murderer!
Yes, he knew saxena
wanted to marry you.
And the money...
I saw him take it.
He distributed all of it
among his vagabond pals.
I can't change the past.
But I can try to stop
what must not happen.
when Lotiya kidnapped you,
only one hand could rescue you.
Munna's hand.
And today when he's leaving
the city for an unknown life..
Even then there's only one
hand to support him in the city.
Your hand.
The aim of my life is to
bring these two together.
Also of my death if need be.
Mohini, go.
stop. You won't go anywhere.
Get out, you twerp!
My physical body may not be strong
But I've strengthened
my soul in the jail.
And sometimes the soul
is stronger than the body!
Mohini, go!
- where are you going?
- Go!
Go! Nobody can stop you today!
No! Let go!
what was lacking in my love..?
That you wanted to test me?
I'll kill myself if
you won't take me this time!
we hear Munna is leaving
for Goa by boat tomorrow.
Munna can't leave me.
we share a blood relation.
His blood and my knife!
I promised him there'll
be only one aim of my life!
His death!
I never forget promises!
Munna will leave
the world not this city!
There's a customer!
He's your old customer.
Don't leave the steering
Hold tight!
Run! Or this goon
will whack your bike.
stop laughing and get to work.
Babban! Terrible news!
Lotiya Pathan is back!
He's at the dock. said
he'll kill Munnabhai!
He'll have to cross my
dead body to get to Munna.
- Munna..?
- where's Babban?
Lotiya is hiding in the
dockyard to kill you.
Babban and gang have gone to fight
I have a score to
settle with you too
Good you came here.
To stop you before
you get to Munna...
I'd follow you to the end of hell!
Destroy them!
stop. I have a score
to settle with him.
No!!
Let go! He wanted to kill you!
Get away!
He promised to kill me
You leave the dagger!
Your life is just starting
Make a get away!
No! Your life is waiting for you!
Your pal is dead.
No...no!
Learn to bow to the law.
Taking my arms and
showing your bravery!
Put away the pistol and
talk if you have the guts!
Then I'll show you which
law can make Lotiya bow!
I need neither uniform nor
pistol to teach a thug the law.
The two arms of the young
men of my country will suffice.
I know I let you take
the law in your hands.
It is wrong yet I let you do it.
Because I felt that was the only
way to drain the acid out of you.
I feel all the acid simmering
in you has been drained out.
And once again you've
become the Mahesh...
..who met me in Nasik.
I've achieved my aim. I'm
willing to accept any punishment.
