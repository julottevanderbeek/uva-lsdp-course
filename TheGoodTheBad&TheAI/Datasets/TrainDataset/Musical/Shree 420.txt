Dmn it!
One, two, three cars...
Absolutely useless.
What's wrong?
What happene driver
Why stop?
Sir a Vagrant is lying
unconscious on the ground
He must be a miserable
fellow with no money
Driver, put him in the car
You know it's my duty to
serve humanity.
He is unconscious. It looks
as if he hasn't eaten a thing.
He maybe love sick
He looks like a...
Driver fast to the hospital.
O God! save my soul
Doctors want only to operate
So you were faking it,
pretending, eh?
I was completely worn out.
I didn't have train fare
Driver, stop the car!
Blasphemy! Fake!
Get out of the car!
As you please.
You were kind a minute ago
Does he suffer from fits?
How dare you! Do you know
who you' re talking to?
Seth Dharmanand
I don't have any sympathy
for your sort.
If you want to reform, swear
that you won't lie or cheat
And you' ll speak only
the truth
On the contrary
If you lie, you drive
in a huge car
Soft hands apply eau-de-cologne
Speaking the truth you suffer
Driver, let's go.
HE looks like a crook
Seth Sonachand, if l' m
a crook, a 420....
You' re....
Bombay 420.
Let's go, old pal
" My shoes are Japanese.
My trousers are English"
"The cap on my head is Russian
but my heart is lndian"
" I venture into
the big, wide world"
" I walk with my head held high"
" Where does my destination lie,
where will I ever settle?"
"The Creator up above us
only knows"
" Like true soldiers,
we forge ahead"
" Up and down,
round and round...."
".... flow the eternal
waves of life"
" Foolish are those
who sit on the side lines"
" With little care
for their country's fate"
"To forge ahead is like life,
To stopstill is like death"
"There may be many a prince,
many a ruler"
" I m like a prince,
just as spoilt"
" I sit on the mighty throne"
" Whenever I feel in the mood"
"Cry the crowds in mazement:
He looks very fmilar"
"The cap on my head is Russian
but my heart is lndian"
Alms!
Is Bombay filled
with only deaf people?
Only the deaf live here.
- And the blind
People in Bombay
hear the jingle of coins
This is Bombay, Bombay
High buildings are made of cement.
People have hearts of stone
Only one thing is sacred,
that's money
Move aside.
It's time for business
Business? You mean work?
That's what l' m looking for.
What can I do to earn my keep?
Do what I do... beg!
Tell me, what kind
of work can I find?
Let me think it over.
Are you educated?
B.A. passed. Look at my
degree. I have it here.
Reliable?
I have a medal for honesty,
a gold medal
Can you work hard?
- 24 hours a day.
No jobs here
No jobs?
No work even for
someone educated? Why?
Because this is Bombay.
It's a big city
If you look for work,
you' ll never find it
If you live by lying and
cheating there are 420 ways
Thank you, boss.
I've learnt a lot today
How much are these?
- Don't touch
What?
Eight annas a dozen
or two annas for three
Two annas for three.
No, three annas for two.
How will I survive.
Take them at 2 annas for 3,
or get lost.
Why do you insist?
No way! 2 annas for 3
Think it over
Two annas for three
Three annas for two
He must be nuts
Come over here
You want 2 for 3 annas?
Here....
Now we' re talking
Oh yes, the money....
I don't have any
Some other time, but remember
Here, pay me later
What if I never pay?
I' ll think my son ate them
How old is your son?
- He's of your age.
Thank you.
You won't misunderstand?
You don't have bananas
but a heart of gold
I' ll pay
He really is nuts, so naive
Like a banana?
Don't throw the skin anywhere
Some don't care about others
They peel the banana and
they fling.....
it anywhere
Uncouth people eating bananas
and throwing the peal anywhere.
What nonsense!
- This is Bombay
Everyone laughs at others
When they slip themselves,
they stop laughing
You' re right, brother
Tell me
Is there a pawn shop
in the area?
It's over there
Everything is sold and bought
Vidya, you've come
to collect your earrings?
No, I've come to sell
these bangles as well
The school isn't running well?
Get the money from the cashier.
Keep them. When you
have the money, return it
Who knows? Maybe I won't
ever see that day
Why talk like that?
It saddens me
One day, a prince will come
into your life
He' ll be handsome and rich.
When he sees you, he' ll be yours
And then he' ll marry you
He' ll shower you
with jewellery.
Then you can return
all you owe me in one go
Take the money. Greet your
father. I' ll visit on Friday
What is it?
What can I show you?
Nothing to buy,
something to sell
That's exactly
what they all say
What is it?
- Honesty
What?
I' ll sell honesty
Here it is
Rashtriya Orphanage
Honesty Medal
How much will I get?
If honesty is sold,
what's left in life?
Did you say something?
- No, nothing
Uncle, l' ll be off
You pawning it or selling it?
I thought I'd sell it
It's always been with me.
I' ll sell it and be done with it
Maybe someday....
Forty rupees
To get it back, pay 50
Now you watch! With these
That's what everyone thinks.
But no one can buy Bombay.
Bombay buys everyone
Everyone ends up right here
I've got money
Here's a 2 rupees
Show!
I' ll pay 5 rupees.
I have it here.
My money!
Who's taken it?
You scoundrels!
Thieves! You play cards
and you rob decent people
Aren't you ashmed?
Where do you think
you' re going?
Can't you see this is reserved?
Go away!
Would you mind
if I slept here tonight?
Pay a shirt
No shirt. I've a Russian
cap instead
Don't you get it? A deposit!
I mean money, cash
I paid 3 rupees.
pay half and stay
Rs. 1.50?
That much just to sleep here?
Yes, 1.50
What do you think? Even a dog
has to pay to sleep here
This Footpath is specially
very soft
Next door to Seth Dharmanand
When he sits to dinner
and the air blows here....
Ah, the aroma!
I don't have money even
to buy poison.
Let me sleep here tonight.
You are not home.
Why involve my fmily
Well, what will you do
if I sleep here?
What are you doing?
Picking on him as he's alone
May I ask if this pavement
is yours
No one owns this foothpath,
this is side-walk
It belongs to the State
Hello, lady banana seller
- How come you' re here?
What's going on?
- Nothing, really..
I was walking and felt
tired so I sat down
These brothers were
looking after me.
Were they beating you?
What were they up to?
Bravo! Hitting the poor boy.
Did they hurt you?
Where do you live?
Where do you sleep?
Nowhere. Where do people
who live nowhere, live?
Right here. Stay with us
on the government's pavement.
Listen everyone,
regard him as our son
Take good care of him.
Treat him well. Help him.
You' ll stay here
This foothpath is our domain
Sit comfortably
Bring tea and snacks
Don't forget the chillies.
Forgive me if I hurt you.
Don't worry. Ganga Ma's
children are like brothers
I' m like your brother,
what's your nme?
I told you all once,
our day would come
Our Raj is here
What do you do for a living?
I' m looking for work.
What a job that is!
You seem to be new here,
that's why you look for work
Or else you'd have fun
like us
What do you do?
Jobless!
Our stories can be told
in a single word : "jobless".
Tell us your story.
Where are you from?
If we' re to be as one,
tell your story.
Tell us something exciting,
I feel sad today
"O Gently people,
hear this story"
" A simple story with no frills,
aimed to give many thrills"
" I was once a boy
of a poor fmily...."
".... who inherited
his mother's destiny"
"Grief and suffering
" Pain and breath did blend"
" Alas! With a face such as mine"
" A thief and l
look one of a kind'
"On the street, one day,
for no rhyme or reason"
" An officer took me away"
" An Officer
Peered over his spectacles"
" He looked me over
barring no obstacles"
"Said he : "Can you see no more" "
" He' s the warden' s brother-in-law"
" l' m still bound by misery
l' m happy but not in ecstasy"
" My destination lies before me.
My feet are tied for all to see"
" Rich folk hinder the fun"
" Heed me but tell none"
" Don't walk with head down"
" Don't sing without rhyme.
Don't shout without reason"
"Or you will end up in prison!"
Why were you sleeping here?
- Sir?
The problem is,
I had a row with my wife
She threw me out of the house
You know the women
of today are like men
Get lost.
Is this a place to sleep?
Get lost.
Go on! He must be a newcomer.
He's nuts
What are you doing?
Can't you see?
Why are you doing that?
To see this wretched world....
You have to look at it
upside down
All the leaders of the
country do the sme thing
Then, they see it right
Behave yourself
or l' ll straighten you out
Constable, is this a crime?
Get along,
You broke the castle
Some people are like that,
they can destroy, not build
They sell honest and sin
What must they do?
Drown!
I agree
Hey you! Wait, Stop!
Were you trying
to commit suicide?
What? Me? Committing suicide?
Yes, suicide
- You mean suicide?
You said that people
like me should drown
That was....
I mean, l' m sorry
You' re right, people
like me should drown.
It's a sin
to commit suicide
You won't will you?
Of course, I will
It's the last sin
So what if you saved me?
Listen, I won't
let you commit suicide.
Can you stop me, if l
want to take my life?
I' ll call the police
to stop you
He's....
- What are you up to?
I' m up to something,
but will she agree?
He
Let me tell you, come this way
She's the one
- Your wife?
Absolutely
She's pretty
Don't get taken in by her face,
she's poison
She jumped into the sea,
I had to get her out
She says : " l' ll drown and
take you with me "
She refuses to go home
So that's it? I' ll fix her
You' ll save a mariage
from breaking up
What is it?
- Go home
Where?
- Home
You, too
- As you say, Constable
Come, let's go
Don't be cross
What are you saying?
Who are you to order me?
Hear that? She says who
m I to order me?
Tell her who I m
Go home or else
to the police station
Why? What have I done?
Committing suicide
But I was...
She says she dived in
save me
Not another word from you.
Go home
Why bicker like children?
Wives should not leave
their homes like that
You' re of the modern generation.
A woman is a home's goddess.
Each lndian woman should
regard her husband as a God.
That's enough!
This is my home. Now go
Have you started again?
Get inside.
You' re still following me?
I see you home, and you
say I've no manners
Vidya?
What is it?
- I've had it! Father
I will tell him
You can't go inside
- Why not?
Let me meet him
Who are you arguing with?
She is arguing with me, father.
Who are you?
- He's....
Shri. Ranbir Raj
My father,
Pandit Omkarnath Shastri
He dived into the sea
- lnto the sea
Tell her not
to jump into such deep waters
Don't interrupt, l' m talking.
Luckily....
I was there
Or else, she would have been
I didn't jump in
- Don't play with life
That's what I said too,
our life is given by God
To misuse it is ungrateful
He jumped in....
Change your clothes.
I' ll sit for a while.
Be careful or you might
catch pneumonia.
He's right. Go and
change your clothes
Serve some tea to
our guest
Sit down.
Thank you, my son.
You've done
She's all I have in the world
It was my duty
Who helps anyone these days?
You risked your life for her.
To jump in the sea is simple.
I can swin for miles
It's a pity that
my expensive suit got wet
Hurry with tea,
he might catch a cold
You' re cheerful
You put yourself
to such bother
The tea is hot, be careful
Liars burn tongues
Did you burn yours?
Not my tongue, but my heart
You' re a very funny fellow.
Hurry, Vidya
The kids are waiting
Hers?
She has fifty
Fifty, my God!
Father, I'd better go
We have a small school
- A school?
I see!
Since I've been paralysed,
Vidya has run the school
We live on little
The poor live here
We are poor, too.
We have nothing better to offer you.
We don't have even a comfortable
chair for you to sit.
It's first class.
Don't let it worry you
Be careful! Are you hurt?
Don't worry
It isn't your fault.
I've put on a little weight.
"One little seed, two seeds
Seed on seed"
"On the roof the girl dances,
The crazy boy takes his chances"
"Guess!"
" Pomegranate"
"There lived
a little girl called Lalbai"
'She wears a red skirt
that a pie"
"She burns your mouth
and she makes your cry"
" Have a guess!"
" A chilli!"
" It's green and
It's surrounded with pearls"
" Deep in the garden
of the king it sways and whirls"
" lts hair is quite wild
and filled with curls"
"Guess!"
"Corn!"
" It's a creature
with money spread on its tail'
" It wears
a crown on its head like a sail"
" It dances full of glee,
Full of joy in a gale."
"Guess!"
" A peacock!"
"One little seed, two seeds
Seed on seed"
"Though its quite out of sight,
It stays close and near"
" It eats, it drinks,
have little or no fear"
" Don't fall into its snare,
Be careful, be wise, beware"
"Guess!"
" Misery!"
" No! It's me!"
Did you see?
She lost her own gme.
Teacher lost the gme
she lost!
Celebrate with a holiday.
Go home
Sit down all of you!
Come back!
Or you will be in for it
Uncouth, illiterate!
Letting them go
Why get so cross?
Let them have some fun
Fun and gme, eh?
To be useless like you?
True, I don't have
any work but....
illiterate....
I' m not. That's the tragedy
If I were, I would be a labourer
What can I do? I m a graduate
That's an even bigger lie!
Look at you.
Do you look educated?
My appearance fools you
If I were dressed
grandly and had a car....
....You wouln't have called
me illiterate
I don't blme you.
The world is not compassionate
Clothes make a man
Fine clothes are more imporatant
than human sentiments
That isn't true.
We aren't rich.
You see, poor people live here
It's shmeful that
the poor forget the poor
Seeing how scruffy I look,
one may assume l' m uneducated.
So I carry my diploma with me
Look.... I m a graduate.
B.A. Pass
I m very sorry
I don't understand why you
dress and behave like a clown
You've got to stand on your
head to see the world straight.
The mask of a clown
is just the thing you need
If you ask me, the best way to
hide one's suffering is to don....
....the mask of a clown.
It's very useful
Stay longer.
- Is Panditji in?
Can I help you?
- Thank you, Vidya
If I need help,
l' ll come to you
Right now I want to help myself.
My destiny beckons me
What does your fate have
in store for you?
Whatever I do,
whichever path I tread....
.... you' ll see,
l' ll become fmous and rich
No one will look down on me
I shall command respect
and admiration.
Long live Dharmanand
Bombayities, accept my greetings
Hindus: " Rm Rm", Muslims: "Salm"
Morning to Christians and
"Sat Sri Akal" to Sikhs
You all know the importance
given to religion and culture
Friends, look at my clothes
From head to foot I m dressed
in clothes made in lndia
Gentlemen, look at me!
My shoes are Japanese,
my trousers are British
My cap is Russian, but
my heart is lndian
Let me repeat, the one thing
that's lndian is my heart
Our greatest preblem is....
Bread!
Bread! Chapatis, nan,
idli, dosa
Whatever you call it,
bread is most essential.
Do I lie?
No, It's the truth
The problem of bread is one of
the soul and peace of mind
You cannot find peace of mind
if you go hungry
That's right!
Many cloud over real issues
like history and religion
Putting emphasis on....
.... bread
Brothers who want to eat
real bread, come to me
To swallow air, go over there
Silence!
Brothers and Sisters! Heed the
call of time, the call of truth
Listen!
Come to me, lovers of bread
No one is better equipped
to solve this
I will ask you one thing....
What is required to eat bread?
Money?
-That's it. Bravo!
One thing's more important
than money
You can deceive others
You can beg, borrow or steal
for bread
But you can never
eat breat without....
TEETH! Yes, brothers, teeth!
Is that clear to everyone?
If your teeth are not strong,
how can you chew properly?
It will lead to indigestion....
weakness and disease
This will end up by weakening
the entire nation
Then enemies can invade
and conquer us, making us slaves
If you want to keep lndia free
and the nation stronger....
Preserve your teeth!
Brush them with my invention :
SUN AND MOON TOOTH POWDER
Teeth will sparkle
like the moon, the sun
Four annas each!
A bottle for me.
Let's get in line
Someone's selling Tooth Powder.
I see.... a 420
Your teeth may be hurting, too.
Why not try that powder?
Tell us something,
what's the powder made of?
Does it contain crushed bones?
There's only coal and sand
from Chowpatty in this
Did you hear that?
He's been cheating us
Instead of powder,
he's selling sand. Hit him!
Where did they hit you?
Well, what do you
think you are doing?
It hurts
Stop it or you' ll singe him
Tell me what the problem is
He was selling sand as
tooth-powder, he asked for it
He won't easily forget
the thrashing he got
Why laugh?
Tell me son, since when have
you started racketeering?
What else can I do, Ganga Ma?
- Drink it up while it's hot
Rest for a few days.
This is your home
Call it a footh, not a home
He's crazy. If we have
a foothpath, we' ll have a home
Raj, you' re educated.
Tell us it can be possible
One day, our government
will build us homes
Fine homes
It's possible that
like us will have homes
How shall we pay the rent?
For anything one must have a job
A worthwhile job
Listen!
I was working in a laundry
I was paid 45 rupees a month
The owner cut 20 rupees
because I burnt a cloth
Is that fair?
I spit at honest work
You left the job? But why?
I was fed up. I quit
You won't go back?
I' ll find work
Where did you work?
At the JAl BHARAT Laundry
Have you worked in one?
I worked at the Sunlight Soap
factory, I mean laundry
I can't tell you
how well I wash clothes
Do you have an iron?
A wife? How can l? I don't
have a job or a house.
I didn't say a `Wife',
but an iron!
I thought you said a `Wife'.
About the ironing, sir....
I' m from a line of washermen
You look a clown.
Can you work hard?
Yes, Sir!
Will you be honest?
- Yes, Sir.
You've got the job.
Thank you sir, thank you.
You' ll be paid 45 rupees.
Start now.
Rm, how is it spelt?
-R....A....M
Raj, how is it spelt?
-R....A....J
Once, again, children!
I m sorry,
I can't understand you
Why do you dress like this
and act like a clown?
Who is it?
Oh, it's you!
How are you?
I cme to give you this
Why did you take the trouble?
-lt was my duty.
How is Panditji?
How are you?
I've some news.
I have bought a laundry
It's in Parsi bazaar
To get there walk....
....just left of Kharsi Parsi
If you feel like it, come visit
I got a new suit
I couldn't visit earlier,
l' m so busy at work
At last, I found
a spare moment today
I m very busy.
It's late. I' ll go now.
I thought I just saw you
putting on a coat
Fooled by appearance
Clothes are tailored for human
beings and not vice-verse
I don't understand
The dress....
The man. What do you say?
I cme to see how
your laundry is doing
Very well
I' m the boss
We eat and drink well
I didn't wear the suit.
It may get spoilt in the rain.
What will you have?
Where will you have tea?
At the Taj or at the Greens?
They' re too far away
I' m very tired as well
The local foothpath Palace Hotel.
It isn't very far
Here's the foothpath restaurant.
Limited furniture
Make yourself comfortable,
l' ll be back
Two special teas, with milk and
sugar.... double the tea
And the unpaid bills?
You don't seem to see
the delicate predicment l' m in
Please wait until I get paid.
Look who's here with me.
Why should I care?
You already owe me 6 rupees
Please understand
Let me have some tea,
my honour's at stake
At least, pay for today's order
Taste Uncle's tea,
you won't go else where
Have you got two annas?
- You mean some change?
I've no change for a hundred
and uncle never has any either
Right, Uncle?
Can I ask something?
If two decent young people
fall in love....
They should marry, right?
When they marry,
they must have children
They will need a home and
clothes to dress the children
Later, the children must
be sent to school
I earn only rupees 45
at the laundry
How can I drem of a marriage
life on 45 rupees, tell me?
A man alone cannot do it, but
if both of them work together
You mean.... Vidya, you and l?
I' ll come to talk
to your father tomorrow
" We' re in love,
We know it's passion"
" Why are our hearts
filled with apprehension?"
" My heart warns me
the path ahead isn't easy"
" Little do we know where we go
Our destination is hazy."
" Assure me no change
will enter our love's rhyme."
" Assure me you' ll
not change with passing time"
"One day,
if you' re no longer mine"
"The moon will no longer shine"
" Each night will be
filled with our story"
"The youth of tomorrow
will sing our melody"
" Neither you nor I will remain"
" But the tokens
of our love will reign."
Constable! It's you.
Is your wife still angry?
Wife? The iron!
Oh Lord! Fire! Water!
Fetch some water!
Hurry up, bring the water!
What's going on?
What's the matter?
What's this nonsense?
Stop this nonsense!
Who did it?
Whose iron is this?
It was my mistake,
I left my iron here
Well done!
You spoke the truth,
you will be fined
You' ll work tomorrow as well.
- But tomorrow's Sunday!
I must see someone.
- Shut Up!
Three jacks
Three queens
What about you? Three kings
Let me see
Three aces
Excellent!
Excuse me Madm,
here are the clothes
I' m only here
delivering clothes
Must be John's
That's right
I' m from Sunlight Laundry,
I mean the Bharat Laundry
Sit down
It was my mistake....
Please forgive me
Don't report it
or else l' ll be fired
Sit down!
Madm Please,
I don't know anything
Don't misunderstand me,
I was only passing time
Deal now.
Look at your cards, 3 aces
It's the truth,
l' m not a crook, l' m not a 420
I'd better be off
I' m not a cardsharp.
Don't report me to the police.
I can't afford to lose my job.
Here's the bill. Please sign it.
Sit down. I' ll be back
Come here, Johnny
Meet a true magician
He deals and three aces appear
Always drinking!
I wish you were alert
We've to rush to the party
