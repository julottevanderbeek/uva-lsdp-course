Christine Daaé left Paris this morning

new Manhattan Opera House.
from us and from him and
his dreams and his scores
What do you mean?
Mother, don't.
That's all over now.
Hey, have the passengers disembarked yet?
Yeah, they're going through customs now.
Here they come!
Hey, it's Mrs. Astor.
Hey, Mrs. Astor! Over here!
Over there, Lucille!
Is that the latest Paris style?
Look, it's Colonel Vanderbilt!
Thanks, Colonel!
Hey, Colonel, is Christine
Daaé still on board?
I believe so, young man.
What's she doing?
Waiting for the conductor?
Hey, Christine, where are you?
Look, there she is!
Christine Daaé!
Miss Daaé, over here!
WOMAN: Christine!
MAN: Christine!
Her name...
Her name is Madame de Chagny!
Stand aside.
Stand aside!
Gustave, come here.
No pictures, do you hear?
No pictures of the boy!
Hey, Christine, sing something!
Your first performance in years!
Why ain't ya singin' at the Met?
The vicomtesse has been engaged
by the well-known impresario,
Mr. Oscar Hammerstein,
to open his new Manhattan Opera House.
How'd he lure the great Christine
Daaé over here anyway?
It's the money, right?
All that American moolah!
My wife is an artist.
Oh, yeah, and her art is payin'
off your gambling debts,
is what they're sayin' in France.
Is it true you left your entire fortune
on a roulette table in Monte Carlo?
You insolent jackals!
How dare you!
Hey, kid, how does it feel
to have a famous mother?
Your first time to America?
It's two weeks till the Opera House opens.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go see the Statue of Liberty?
Gonna ride the new subway?
You gonna go to the baseball?
I want to go to Coney Island.
And learn how to swim.
Look at that! No horses!
That's the darnedest thing I've ever seen.
How does it work?
Honored friends
Mr. Hammerstein's expecting you
Gustave!
Where is Hammerstein?
We were assured he'd be
here to greet us in person!
I give up.
Take us to Hammerstein!
Could the fool have thought
that our pride was bought
What a farce! What an
outright slap in the face
Gustave, enough!
The answer's no!
Must you play now?
I think it's beautiful.
RAOUL: What is it, anyway?
I don't know, it was
just here on the piano.
Well, it hurts my head.
if that would serve to
ease your troubled mind
Raoul.
What's this?
What is it?
It's from Hammerstein.
He wants to meet me in
the hotel bar. Alone.
Alone?
Well, he may lack courtesy,
but he does show a certain savoir faire
in choosing a business rendezvous.
Raoul, please.
Please what?
Nothing.
Oh, darling.
Time for bed now, Gustave.
I'll be in in a minute.
BOTH: At last,
There is no now.
I know what Hammerstein is paying you.
I will double the amount
for just one night's work.
Here, in my concert hall.
No.
Just one night, Christine.
One song.
That is all I ask.
Why should I?
For 10 years, you've let
me believe you were dead,
and now you lure us here and
expect me to do your bidding,
submit to you again.
I won't do it.
I owe you nothing.
Gustave, it's all right, darling.
Your world?
Where are we?
We're in Phantasma, little vicomte.
On Coney Island.
A world of fantasy
where illusion is emperor.
Tell me where you'd like to go
Tell me what you want to see
You shall see it all tomorrow.
In fact, I myself will show you.
I promise.
CHRISTINE: Back to sleep
now, Gustave.
Why does he wear a mask,
Mother? Is he a magician?
Yes, darling.
In his way.
What a child.
Full of life.
Full of you, my Christine.
What are you saying?
How could you?
After all that we've been.
Who are you?
I am your Angel of Music!
I am dying, Christine!
Suffocating here in the dark!
Give me breath! Give me life! Sing for me!
Or I will take from you
everything you have ever loved.
No, no, you can't!
Oh, but I can.
A man as hideous as this, believe
me, is capable of anything.
He's nowhere to be seen.
Insolence!
Who?
Hammerstein.
What the devil is going on in this place?
Darling.
Christine?
Things have changed, Raoul.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, you must take care.
Go spend some time working with Meg.
Ladies, come, let's go
over the port de bras.
Gentlemen, remember to
plié before the lift.
Then some control, gentlemen, please.
Slow down, Gustave. There are
people working here, be careful.
But I want to find Mr. Y,
and go see the island.
I'm sure he'll send
for you when he's ready.
Who is this Mr. Y?
What does he do?
Apart from spend ludicrous amounts of money
on light entertainment?
Father, look over there!
Gustave, slow down!
Look at you, Christine! Regal
as a queen and beautiful!
Oh, my goodness!
That seems odd, there must be some
mistake That's the leading lady's slot
Christine, it's a thrill just
to share the bill with you
this Mr. Y
with whom we've signed
And yet, old friends let's
not get upset, old friends
With two old friends trustable
and true, old friends!
No offense, but I need
something stronger. Raoul!
Madame, I shall see you
tomorrow night at the concert,
where I am sure you will
both surpass yourselves.
Good day.
Raoul! Please.
I can explain!
I'm sorry.
Meg, I wonder would
you mind... Gustave?
What's wrong? My son. He was with...
Gustave! Gustave!
MEG: Christine, wait!
One moment, little vicomte,
while I prepare our adventure.
May I?
Does the young vicomte play?
What's this?
Go on.
This boy...
This music...
He plays like me...
My God!
Come with me.
I need to show you something.
Follow me. I want to
know what you think!
Have you ever yearned to go past
the world you think you know?
Have you let it draw you in past
the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
of the beauty underneath?
Yes!
Do you find yourself beguiled
by the dangerous and wild?
Have you felt your senses surge
and surrendered to the urge?
And been hooked as you looked
at the beauty underneath?
Yes!
PHANTOM: Can it be?
Heavenly!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
GUSTAVE: Yes!
PHANTOM:
GUSTAVE: Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
MEG: Gustave!
CHRISTINE: Gustave! Gustave!
Gustave. It's all right!
It's me!
It's horrible, horrible!
Shh. Don't be frightened.
PHANTOM: How could you
Listen, darling, I want
you to go with Miss Giry
back to the hotel.
All right?
I have to talk
to Mr. Y alone.
Meg, do you mind?
Please? Please.
Forgive me.
All shall be his?
One more.
Ah, buddy, don't you think you had enough?
It's practically morning already.
One more, I said!
All right.
All right.
My shift is over anyway, so
let's settle the bill, okay?
Jeez, you're in a bad way, ain't ya?
Worse than most that wind up here.
Here's the morning shift. Maybe
he'll know what to do with you.
Yes.
Yes, what to do with me.
That's the question, isn't it?
That's always been the question,
ever since the beginning.
Did you hear me?
Another drink!
Vicomte.
Fancy meeting you here.
Miss Giry.
Drowning your sorrows, are you?
On the contrary, I'm celebrating
a reunion with old friends.
Friends I had long thought dead and buried.
And you?
Me?
I've been for a swim.
Miss Giry?
What do you think will happen, Vicomte?
At the concert.
Have you thought?
When he hears her sing
again? When she sings...
Miss Giry, I wish I knew.
But I'm afraid her music has always
been somewhat of a mystery to me.
But there's more to this
than the music, monsieur.
Believe me. I saw it.
There's something...
I don't know.
Just take her away. Now.
For all our sakes.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Trust me, monsieur.
Don't let her sing.
Once he gets into her soul, there's
nothing she won't do for him.
Miss Giry! Miss Giry!
He's not Mephistopheles, you know?
When it comes down to it, he's
just another circus freak.
I'm not afraid of him.
No. It can't be!
Not afraid of me, you say?
Stay back! Or I'll kill you, I promise you.
Insolent boy.
You think you own more
of her soul than I do?
She is my wife!
Your music may speak to her,
but her heart will always follow me.
You think so?
You really think so?
Follow you?
With all your charms?
Our Christine shall choose
tonight Let her choose
Every throw... You think
you've fixed the dice
We've a son
What?
Dear God, what have I done?
I could lose her forever.
My Christine!
ALL: Everyone
But first, for those of you whose taste
is a little
more earth-bound...
It's Phantasma's
famous Ooh-La-La Girl!
The incomparable...
ALL: Meg Giry!
Ooh!
Girls?
GIRLS: Bathing beauty
Checks.
MEN: What a cutie!
Stripes.
Dots?
GIRLS: Dots?
Dots? Dots?
MEN: Dots?
Dots?
ALL: Dots!
Whoo!
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Meg
Giry, the Ooh-La-La Girl!
In just a few moments, Christine Daaé,
the world's most celebrated songbird,
will be making her American debut.
Mother, can you tell? The
new routine it went so well
Why, they've never been so
loud Screaming only for me
Meg...
And the master must have heard
Every note and every word
Meg, stop it.
What do you mean?
Yes, all but the one whose
entrancement we sought
He wasn't even there?
With Christine?
Their son?
No, you're wrong!
Don't say that!
No! No!
Gustave, could you hand me those earrings?
The sapphires on the left.
There!
How do I look?
Father! Doesn't Mother look lovely tonight?
Indeed she does.
As lovely as she looked the very first time
I came to her
dressing-room door.
And look at you, Raoul.
You look just like that
handsome boy in the opera-box,
the one who would always
toss me a single red rose.
But when's Mother going to sing?
We don't want to miss it.
You can both watch from the wings.
Raoul...
We've both been...
Anything, darling.
What? But...
You have to know something's
terribly wrong, dear
But, darling, I'm due
on stage in 10 minutes.
How can I possibly...
I beg you please. Please.
I have a passage for three to
Cherbourg on the Atlantic Queen.
It leaves tonight. Let's be
on it, for both our sakes.
And for Gustave.
Go and find Gustave.
Tell the stage manager not to disturb me.
I need some time.
STAGE MANAGER:
Five minutes, Miss Daaé.
RAOUL: Christine!
PHANTOM: But every hope
Ready on the rail?
STAGE HAND 1:
Ready on the rail.
STAGE MANAGER:
Ready on the floor?
STAGE HAND 2:
Ready on the floor!
RAOUL: Will she stay?
PHANTOM: Obey your heart
Does she know even now? You
want it so, stay and be mine
PHANTOM: Use your head
RAOUL: No time to wait
STAGE MANAGER:
Ready in the pit?
STAGE HAND 3:
Ready in the pit!
And then my child and I
We'll get what we deserve
And then my child and I
We'll get what we deserve
I hope Christine is worthy of you.
I hope her singing makes
up for what your blindness
has done to Meg and me.
STAGE MANAGER: And curtain.
BOTH: Lost in
"My dearest wife."
Raoul, no!
RAOUL: Little Lotte Ah,
what fools we once were
Romantic idiots.
"Those two people
are gone."
BOTH: Now I must go
The opera is done The last
notes have been played
Yours, in regret...
"Raoul."
Gustave.
What is it?
Gustave.
What's wrong?
I told him to wait for Raoul.
Before he asked me to...
Surely he wouldn't...
That perfidious Raoul I
will kill that drunken fool
That he'd dare take this
child A child that isn't his
SQUELCH: Sir.
And that comment she made The
ungrateful, back-biting snake
What is the meaning of this?
How dare your circus ghouls
manhandle me in this fashion?
The boy, woman!
What have you done with him?
The boy? You think I took the boy?
Why would I do such a thing?
Do you think I don't know who he is?
FLECK: Sir?
I just passed Meg's dressing
room It was silent as a tomb
My poor Gustave!
I know where she's going.
But we must hurry!
Gustave!
GUSTAVE: Miss Giry,
I can't swim.
Please. You're hurting me. I can't swim.
Don't worry.
It's almost over.
CHRISTINE: Gustave!
Mother?
PHANTOM:
Let go of the boy, now!
Let go of him, girl.
I did as Mother said And
followed where you led
Meg. My little Meg!
CHRISTINE: Gustave! PHANTOM: No,
don't do that, girl. Please.
Here's the big
finish And then you can go
No, Meg, don't!
Give me the hurt and the
pain And the gun, Meg
Give me the blame for not seeing
the things That you've done, Meg
Yes.
Yes.
No! No! Madame Giry, get help.
Quickly!
Meg!
Meg!
No!
Father!
Where's Father?
Gustave!
Your father...
Christine, no!
I know. I promised.
But you are all he has now.
He has to know the truth.
Christine, please.
Gustave.
Your father, your real father
is here.
No. No.
No!
Gustave!
BOTH: Just love
No!
