Christmas comes but once a year
For every girl and boy
he laughter and the joy
hey find in each new toy
l'll tell you of a little boy
Who lives across the way
his little fella's Christmas
ls just another day
He's the little boy
hat Santa Claus forgot
And goodness knows
He didn't want a lot
He sent a note to Santa
For some soldiers and a drum
lt broke his little heart
When he found Santa hadn't come
ln the street he envies
All those lucky boys
Easy. Be careful.

of a rectangle...
