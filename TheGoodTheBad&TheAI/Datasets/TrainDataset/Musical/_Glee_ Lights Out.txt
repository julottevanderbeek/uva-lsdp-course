Glee.
Glee.
Hey, Kitty,
who are you texting?
Let me see your phone.
I'm playing 4 Pics 1 Word,
weirdo stalker.
Do I need to get
a restraining order?
Guys, we got a problem.
Her name is Frida Romero.
The bombs bursting in air...
The Hoosierdaddies have
a secret weapon.
She's a tiny little sophomore,
never competed before,
but her voice
could fill an arena.
I mean, it's big.
And the only way to beat them
is to be huge.
I'm talking stadium huge.
Epic songs
that will blow the heads
off of 100,000 people at a time.
Zombie apocalypse.
Or Beyonce's halftime show.
FIGGINS:
Children, this power outage
is not an emergency.
Nor is it an excuse to go
wilding through the hallways.
While we're investigating
the root of this near calamity,
classes will continue
and your brains are to remain
in the on positions.
If the darkness persists,
candles and flashlights
will be distributed based
on grade point average.
I now have to turn
off the P.A. system
so I can save
our precious generator resources
for the coffee machine
and my plug-in
lower back vibrator.
Okay, that puts a damper
on our stadium songs.
Time for a new
appropriate lesson.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's unplugged week.
I can't believe she
blew me off like that.
Who? Katie?
How do you even know
this person is a she?
Or even a human?
Look, stop, all right?
All I know is I've had this
really amazing connection.
You've got to let this go, man.
It's crazy.
You don't even know her.
Look, you don't understand,
Jake.
I've never felt
so close to someone.
Look, I told her things
about myself, about my past,
I've never told anyone.
Ever.
If this were to get out...
Wait.
I thought your biggest secret
was dyslexia.
Well, what is it?
I can't.
Fine, dude, keep it all
locked away
for a few more years,
but it's not going away.
Maybe you should think
about starting to share
your deep, dark secrets
with people you actually know.
Right? I found this
out by the Dumpster.
With a little TLC
and three clicks
from Kurt's ruby slippers,
this bad boy
would be salvageable.
Um, can you please take a seat, because Kurt and
I would like to have a conversation with you.
All right, you know what, Rachel,
if you are still obsessing
over what you're gonna sing
at your  callback,
may I suggest
your best jam ever,
"Run, Joey, Run."
We think you're throwing
your life away.
KURT:
It's bad enough you let
those horny tourists
grope you for tips
at that awful Coyote Ugly bar,
but Tina just informed me
that you are now a bouncer
at a lesbian beer garden?
And you're a go-go girl.
A go-go girl!
Oh, yeah, a girl-bar go-go girl.
I am a cage dancer...
big difference.
I'm dressed as Barbarella,
and I'm sorry,
but some of us actually
need to work for a living.
Okay, that's not the point.
Okay, you're so talented,
Santana.
You're, like,
the most talented person I know,
obviously with the exception
of me and Kurt.
But your voice, it's electric,
and I would kill for
half of your dancing abilities.
So I'm telling you
what you told me,
which is that you just need to
stop and focus on your talent.
Well, maybe I don't want to be
in  okay?
Or be a singing waiter at
the Fire Island Pancake Shack.
So why don't you just
stop trying to force
all of your creaky
old-time Broadway dreams
on to my amazingly
awesome dream.
And what's that?
I am trying to figure that out.
What is so wrong with taking
a little time
to figure things out?
Nothing. But what about doing
something in the meantime?
Like dance lessons?
NYADA has a great
extension program
for non-students.
Yeah.
Something to keep
your motors revved,
you know...
My "motor"
is revved every night
that I cage dance.
And while I appreciate
your pity,
I don't really think
I need to be taking
any advice from TV's
and Lady Elaine Fairchilde.
Would you take
your chair with you?
All right, I know
these conditions aren't ideal,
but I want to thank you guys
for toughing it out.
And we have our first volunteer,
who is going to show us
how to get back to basics
and really strip it down.
So, let's give it up for Sam.
Right.
Uh, take it away.
Thanks.
Um, well,
when Mr. Shue started
talking about being big,
I started thinking
about Phil Spector's
legendary Wall of Sound,
and how he would use, like,
thousands of instruments
so his songs could really
fill a stadium.
And then I started
thinking about stripping,
um,
out all that extra noise
to get to the essence
of the song.
Plus, my mom said that
I was conceived to this song,
so I kind of literally
owe my existence
to the Righteous Brothers.
Anyways, uh, here it goes.
You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss
your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before
In your fingertips
You're trying hard
not to show it
But, baby
Baby, I know it
You've lost
that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost
that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa-whoa-oh
We had a love
A love, a love
you don't find every day
Oh, baby
So don't
Don't, don't
Don't let it slip away
Baby
Yeah
Bring back
that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back
that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
WILL:
Wow, you see that, guys?
That's the kind of power
and passion
that we need for regionals.
Good job, Sam.
Um, next up, uh, Artie.
Show us what you got.
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.
I can't do Miguel
without my synth.
I needs my synth!
No, you needs to man up.
Excuse me?
You know how often
the power went off at my house,
how many times my dad couldn't
afford to pay the stupid bill?
Relax, dude. I had to entertain
my brother and sister
with just my guitar
and my voice,
and we didn't have any synth.
I mean, like, I saw you
texting during my song,
and it's not just you;
It's all of us.
We're so focused
on being plugged in
to the Twitterverse
and the Blogosphere
that we don't appreciate what's
actually right in front of us.
And I think that that's
just sad and lame.
Great, so we'll include
a Blu-ray of
um, in the gift bag and a note
from the director,
"How Ballet Inspired Me."
Oh, that's perfect.
Thanks, Darren.
I appreciate it.
Oh, and, uh, listen,
you're at my table,
seated next to Christopher.
So be nice.
All right, bye.
Darren...?
Aronofsky. Christopher Nolan.
Oh.
You may be seated.
So, first of all,
how is your dad?
Oh, uh, thank you for asking.
He's doing good.
Um, he's back at work,
and all his treatments
seem to be working.
Good, I'm happy to hear that.
I thought you might
have called me in here
because, um,
you were gonna fire me.
What? Why would I do that?
When you gave me the internship,
you said it would be 24/7,
and ever since
I got accepted to NYADA...
You haven't been coming in
as much.
We've noticed.
But quality
trumps quantity always.
And though NYADA's gain
is Vogue.com's loss,
I will never stop anyone
from pursuing their passion.
But I need your help.
You know I'm co-chairing
the gala
for New York City Ballet's
educational programs?
Yeah, it's only  social event
of the performing arts season.
My celebrity wrangler
just canceled.
It was going
to be Anna's daughter,
but she got the chicken pox
Ã  la Barbara Walters.
So I need somebody.
I need somebody good
who can dive in ASAP.
If anyone else does this,
I-I will literally die.
Okay. All right.
Yes.
And listen, um,
if you want to draft
a couple of friends
to help you out,
that's good, too.
Yeah?
SUE: Dear journal,
I speak to you now
I'm the same boy
I used to be
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Let me hear
those childless pelvic pops.
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me Fishy hands.
Call on me.
Fishy hands.
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me.
Take it, take it.
Leg up, leg up.
Call on me.
And down.
All right.
That's it.
Uh, no crying
in my classroom.
Go on.
Go home to mommy.
Fact, if I hadn't mistaken you
for a butch Israeli girl,
I would've never
let you in here.
B, the fact that
you survived my boot camp 101,
also known as Sue 90X,
trademark pending,
I will allow you to speak.
Just don't sing.
I'll admit,
I rejoined the Cheerios
with the sole plan
of destroying you
from the inside.
Admirable. But now that
you're gone, I can see
that all the Cheerio girls
are lost without you,
and frankly,
as student council president,
I'm a little worried
about the kind of advice
Coach Roz is giving.
And that is why
you all signed up
with Dr. Fong to get
a couple of those fatty ribs
removed for flexibility.
What?
You know, I always thought
Becky could look like
a young Dolly Parton
with a couple less ribs.
Something went down
at that school,
and it has something
to do with you.
Someway, somehow,
the kids are still shaken up.
No one feels safe.
Set the record straight.
We need you, Coach Sue.
ARTIE:
Hey.
I was thinking about what you
said, and you're totally right.
I kind of got inspired
when I was rolling down
the hallway in between classes.
And the sound it made
was almost musical,
and it got me thinking; we don't
have to have electricity
to make music. We don't
even need real instruments.
I didn't say you couldn't
use instruments. I was...
I know, but think about it.
We want to win regionals,
and we're gonna have
to do it as a team.
And imagine how we could get
everybody working together
if we pushed ourselves to
pull off a song with nothing
but a water bottle and
pencils and a zipper,
and who knows what else.
You want unplugged.
This would be unplugged squared.
I like it.
Ladies?
What is the event
the Big Apple's hoi polloi
must be invited to
or they'll pull a Javert
and swan dive off the
Chrysler Building?
The New York City
Ballet Gala, duh.
And guess who gets to attend
if they just volunteer a few short hours?
Anne Hathaway?
It's us, it's us!
Are you serious?
And just when you thought
it couldn't get any gayer,
it does.
Make fun of it all you want,
but the New York City
Ballet Gala,
it's a celebration
of a timeless art.
If it wasn't for ballet,
I wouldn't be here.
KURT:
I started ballet
at the ripe old age of three.
And I skipped all that crap
to study the timeless art
of crunk.
Look, you can tell Isabelle
that I am definitely in.
Not me, count me out.
You mean you don't want
to wear a designer dress
from the legendary
Vogue.com vault
that you get to keep as a gift?
I'm in.
She's in.
She's in.
I know these songs are
supposed to be unplugged,
but I asked Mr. Shue
permission to do
a full orchestration.
Which I gladly agreed to,
because Ryder eloquently told me
that what he wanted to unplug
were his feelings.
I want to really reveal myself
through this song.
And frankly, I think
I kind of need the support
to get there.
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of us,
and for all the slushees...
real and proverbial...
that we've all taken
to the face over the years.
When your day is long
And the night
The night is yours alone
When you're sure
you've had enough
Of this life
Well, hang on
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
Sometimes everything
is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone
Hold on
When you feel like
letting go
Hold on
If you think
you've had too much
Of this life
Well, hang on
Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts
Sometimes
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
So hold on.
That was amazing, Ryder.
You certainly unplugged
whatever you were looking
to let out.
I didn't want
to just get them out.
I wanted to get
in touch with them
so I could maybe have the balls
to tell you guys something.
Something that's pretty hard
to talk about.
It's cool, bro.
You can let it out.
I've actually only told
one person this.
Not even my parents know.
But...
I'm not sure if I could trust
that person to keep it secret.
So before this gets out,
I want to be the one
to open the box.
When I was 11,
I was molested by my babysitter.
She just walked in on me
in the shower,
and she touched me a bit.
Wait, hold on.
Did you just say "she"?
Like, as in a girl?
Like, a teenage girl?
Yeah, she was, like, 17, 18.
SAM:
Dude,
you were 11
and some hot 18-year-old
plays with your junk?
I'd have killed for that.
Why are you ashamed of this?
I don't know, I...
It kind of messed me up a bit.
Like, I have trouble
trusting girls
because of it, I think.
Guys, this is not something
to high-five about.
Ryder, I'm sorry,
but I'm obligated to report it.
Whatever,
she already got locked up.
She was caught doing it
to some other kid.
SAM: Okay, I'm sorry, but
why-why is that a crime?
I mean, it's every
teenage boy's fantasy.
I mean, there's, like, 50
'80s movies about it.
I mean,
We get it, Sam, thanks.
Guys, this is so uncool.
His truth is his truth,
not yours.
RYDER: You know what,
it's cool, okay?
Uh, the guys are right.
I don't know what
I was thinking.
Uh, I'm, like,
the luckiest guy in here.
So...
You know, yeah.
Good job.
Thanks.
I mean, kid clearly has
superior game.
You know, I was
sort of surprised when
you asked me to dinner,
'cause I know you're, like,
dating Jake's brother
and everything.
Puck and I broke up.
He dumped me when he went off
to live at a college
he doesn't go to.
From a distance,
Puck is super hot,
but you don't really realize
until you're right up close
how puffy he is.
Here you go.
I don't know why I have
such terrible luck
with guys.
It's probably because I come on
really strong
and pretend to be all slutty,
and then I freeze up right away
and get distant
and drop weird hints
that my vagina has teeth.
But I didn't come here
to talk about
the razor-sharp barbs
guarding my cervix.
I noticed how withdrawn you got
this week
in Glee Club after you told
everyone your secret.
It may have seemed
like no one else
in that room understood
what you went through,
but...
I did.
It was, um, my friend
Julie's older brother.
I was in sixth grade.
One night,
Julie had a sleepover,
and in the middle of the night,
he came down into the basement
and crawled
into my sleeping bag.
At first, I thought
it was a joke.
I didn't know
what was happening.
But then he started, um...
to feel me in places.
In the morning,
I went straight home
without saying good-bye,
and I couldn't tell my parents
for a while.
I was afraid
of upsetting them or something.
So when I did tell them,
they were really confused.
They didn't understand
why I waited so long
to say something about it.
My mom called his parents,
and all I could hear her say
was how good of a kid he was
and how she didn't
know how something
like that could happen.
And then Julie
stopped talking to me
and told everyone at school
that I was spreading rumors
about her brother.
Then she told all my friends
to stop talking to me.
Finally,
I just decided it'd just
be easier to switch schools.
So I did.
I understand what it feels like
to have something
like that happen to you
and feel like
nobody understands.
I guess I just wanted you
to know that...
I do.
Thanks.
Buddy, you're a boy,
make a big noise
Playin' in the street,
gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face,
you big disgrace
Kickin' your can
all over the place, singin'
We will
We will rock you
We will
We will rock you
Buddy, you're a young man
Hard man,
shouting in the street
Gonna take on
the world someday
You got blood on your face,
you big disgrace
Waving your banner
all over the place
We will
We will rock you
Sing it!
We will
We will rock you
Buddy, you're an old man
Poor man pleading
with your eyes
Gonna make you
some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace,
somebody better put you
Back into your place Come on!
We will
We will rock you
Sing it!
We will
We will rock you
Everybody
We will
We will rock you
We will
We will rock you
All right!
Da, da-da, da-da
Da, da, da, da-da,
da-da, da, da, da.
BECKY:
Hi, Coach.
Can I watch it with you?
Jackson, you are out of uniform.
I was thinking of
quitting the team.
I can't stand how
Coach Roz treats me.
Maybe the fact that you grew
from an itty-bitty fetus
into a full-size adult
in less than a calendar year
has made you cocky,
Robin Sylvester,
but around here,
we like our protein shakes
to taste like human food
and not some crazy
peanut butter stem cell sauce
you cooked up on
your Island of Dr. Moreau!
Well, I have always admired
her run-on sentences.
Coach, please come back.
I know you did this
to protect me.
I'm sorry.
I miss you so bad it hurts.
Oh, honey, I miss you, too.
But the fact is,
this is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.
As a trainer,
people take me seriously.
and what did it get me?
Certainly not their respect.
Just a sad, lazy grab bag
of quitters, backstabbers,
flip-floppers,
lipstick lesbians
and ungrateful, sloppy,
knocked-up sluts.
And me.
And you.
Becky, I'm sorry,
honey, I've moved on,
and I can't go back
to babysitting brats.
Little girls, little girls
Everywhere I turn
I can see them
Little girls
Little girls, night and day
I eat, sleep
and breathe them
I'm an ordinary woman
With feelings
I like a man
to nibble on my ear
Though I'll admit
No man has bit
So how come
I'm the mother of the year?
Some women are dripping
with diamonds
Some women are
dripping with pearls
Lucky me, lucky me
Look at
what I'm dripping with
Little girls
Someday I'll land
in the nuthouse
With all the nuts
and the squirrels
There I'll stay, tucked away
Till the prohibition of
Little...
Girls...
Becky, you couldn't pay me
to go back to that.
And I don't miss them at all.
Not one bit.
Not at all.
Okay, you're on
Rex Reed duty, Kurt.
Keep him away from the open bar.
Gotcha.
Hey, Santana, how do you feel
about Cherry Jones?
Whatevs.
Miss Isabelle, I'm sorry,
I know that we're
just volunteers here,
but Kurt and I were wondering
if there was any possibility
that we could maybe watch the
performance from the audience.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry.
You're gonna be watching
from the wings with me.
It's the best seat
in the house.
Santana, you want to join us?
Oh, Santana
doesn't like ballet.
She's only here for the gown
and the swag-bag.
Oh, I don't believe that.
Every little girl,
no matter where she ends up...
even at Vogue.com...
starts out wanting to be
a ballerina.
Not Santana.
We've discussed it.
Kurt, can I just show you...
Shut up, Berry.
I actually did take
ballet classes.
My  put me in them
when I was little,
because I was such a tomboy
and it really pissed my dad off.
I only took a few
lessons, but...
it helped me, uh,
escape a little, you know?
It was the first time I danced.
I felt safe there, and...
not different.
And part of something...
beautiful.
Daddy always thought
that he married beneath him
That's what he said,
that's what he said
When he proposed,
he informed my mother
It was probably
her very last chance
And though she was 22
Though she was 22
Though she was 22...
She married him
Life with my dad
wasn't ever a picnic
More like a come-as-you-are
When I was five,
I remember my mother
Dug earrings out of the car
I knew that
they weren't hers
But it wasn't something
you want to discuss
He wasn't warm
Well, not to her.
Well, not to us.
But everything was beautiful
At the ballet
Graceful men
lift lovely girls in white
Yes, everything
was beautiful
At the ballet...
I was happy
At the ballet
Up a steep
and very narrow stairway
To the voice
like a metronome
Up a steep
and very narrow stairway
It wasn't paradise
It wasn't paradise
It wasn't paradise
ISABELLE:
But it was home
Mother always said
I'd be very attractive
When I grew up,
when I grew up
Different, she said,
with a special something
And a very,
very personal flair
And though
I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
I hated her
Now, different is nice,
but it sure isn't pretty
Pretty is what it's about
I never met anyone
who was different
Who couldn't figure that out
So beautiful
I'd never live to see
But it was clear
If not to her...
well, then to me.
That everyone is beautiful
At the ballet
Every prince has got to have
His swan
Yes, everyone is beautiful
At the ballet
Hey...
I was pretty
At the ballet
I was born
to save their marriage.
But... when my father
came to pick my mother up
at the hospital, he said,
"Well, I thought this was
gonna help, but I guess not."
A few months later, he left.
And he never came back.
Anyway,
I had this
fantastic fantasy life.
I used to dance
around the living room
with my arms up like this.
And in my fantasy,
there was an Indian chief,
and he would say to me,
"Izzy, do you
want to dance?"
And I would say, "Daddy",
I would love to dance."
But it was clear
When he proposed
That I was born
To help their marriage
and when...
That's what she said
That's what he said
I used to dance around
The living room
He wasn't warm
Not to her
It was an Indian
chief, and he'd say
"Izzy, do you want
to dance?"
And I'd say,
"Daddy, I would love to"
Everything was beautiful
At the ballet
Raise your arms
And someone's always there
Yes, everything
was beautiful
At the ballet
The ballet
The ballet...
Yes, everything
was beautiful
At the ballet
Hey
I was pretty
I was happy
I would love to
At the ballet.
Sorry.
Listen, I really love dancing.
I just am not like you guys.
I don't know what I want to do
or how I'm even gonna get there.
But you have plenty of time
to figure it out.
And... it doesn't have to be
ballet or Broadway,
just as long as
it's something that you love,
something that feeds your soul.
And, Santana,
baby steps are okay.
Sue's adult baby is being
a belligerent pain in my booty,
and I am not
gonna take it anymore!
First she started making fart
noises every time I bent over.
Then she started
making fart noises
every time I blinked.
Ain't nobody fart every time
they blink... that's crazy!
Then Robin Sylvester
called me "Coach Chocolate Pie."
I marched her
down here so  can
decide what to do with her.
It's your problem!
Becky Jackson,
you can't insult
the sultry and mysterious
Coach Roz Washington.
She is
an African-American treasure.
I only misbehaved so she'd
send me here to talk to you.
Why didn't you just
come here yourself?
I didn't think of that.
Principal Figgins,
I need to tell you something.
FIGGINS:
Citizens of McKinley,
the power has been restored.
Congratulations to all of us
for refusing to resort
to idol worship
and rampant cannibalism.
We have discovered
that the blackout occurred
when a Mylar balloon
congratulating
my secretary Donna
on her successful hysterectomy
became trapped in an outlet
behind her file cabinet.
McKinley Titans,
it is a new dawn.
Let us welcome a new era
of peace and prosperity.
Yours truly, Principal Figgins.
JAKE:
Okay, let's flip some switches
and rock out, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, guys.
Don't plug back in just yet.
There's one more thing
this power outage
can really drive home for us:
The power
of singing a capella.
I hate whistling.
Nothing but our voices
for this next number.
No other instruments
or bottles or tools or anything.
At the end of the day,
our voices
are the only instruments
that truly matter.
So make it count.
Hey, son of Frankenteen.
I just started the Subway diet,
and it's time for my second
five-dollar foot-long.
Want to buy it for me?
Um...
I'm kidding.
Come on, I'll buy you a sub.
I have, like, 20 more
humiliating stories to tell you.
That sounds awesome,
but... I can't.
Kind of have a date.
With who?
Katie.
The catfish?
How can you pick an online
fantasy over an actual fantasy?
She's not a fantasy.
She's a projection.
She's whatever
you want her to be.
Why do you think
you get along so well?
You have no real intimacy
with this person.
Stop embarrassing yourself
and come have lunch with me.
Look, I get that
this seems a little kooky,
and part of me
really wants to go
with you right now,
but I'm sorry.
I don't warm to people
easily, and...
I was really starting
to like you.
Maybe after I find out
who Katie is
and we straighten all this out,
we could go out then.
I don't think so.
I hope that...
You're late.
I like to make an entrance.
: And if
we're really gonna talk
about late, can you say
something to Gramps right here?
Sit.
:
Excuse me.
This is NYADA Extension.
You sign up,
you pay, you get in.
Anyone.
And what I was going to say was
that I hope none of you
came here expecting
that it would help you
get into NYADA as a student.
Good. 'Cause the last thing
I want to do
is pay 30 grand a year to get
a degree for doing something
that I'm already
freakin' Wonder Woman at.
Then what are you doing here?
I love to dance.
I'm an artist, but...
I sort of lost touch
with that part of myself lately,
and so I'm here to...
do some reintroducing.
I can dig that.
Everybody up.
To the bar. PliÃ©s, please.
Two demi, one grand,
port de bras forward.
Don't forget me again, okay?
I won't.
I promise.
I've got you now.
Bum, bum, bum
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh
For the longest
If you said
Good-bye to me tonight
There would
Still be music left to write
What else could I do?
I'm so inspired by you
I haven't been there
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice
You're hearing in the hall
And the greatest
Miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me, too
That hasn't happened
for the longest time
Maybe this won't
Last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been
Hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more
than I hoped for
Who knows how
Much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be
Sorry when you're gone
I want you so bad
I think you ought
to know that
I intend to hold you
for the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh
For the longest time.
Nice.
