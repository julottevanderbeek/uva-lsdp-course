So here's what you missed
on Glee. Will's dating
The hot substitute, holly
holliday. She's totally sassy
And you can really see
why he's into her.
Sexy.
Quinn and Finn are back
together in a big way, and so
Is the Glee club. They did
original songs, and now they're
Headed to new york.
Get out! Go!
But sue thinks will made her
lose at nationals, and she's
Sort of gone over the edge,
even for her, and that's saying
Something, and that's what you
missed on Glee!
All right. We need $5,000
To pay for our trip
to nationals in new york.
What happened to the money
that we got from the cheerios!?
I guess sue was hiding it
in offshore accounts
In the cayman islands,
and we're having some trouble
Accessing some of it.
Any of it.
This is salt water taffy.
Ah, I love salt water.
When I was a student here,
we paid for our entire trip
To nationals, selling this.
Classroom to classroom,
Door to door,
We pushed this stuff like crack.
And so will we.
So, to make $5,000
At 25 cents apiece,
We need to sell 20,000
pieces of taffy.
Wait, do you honestly think that
we can sell 20,000 anythings?
I mean, we won regionals
For the first time since
dinosaurs roamed the planet,
And I still got a freaking
cherry icee facial.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Santana is right.
Nobody cares about us.
I can't listen to this.
Mike, are you okay?
No.
You guys complain all the time
about being mistreated,
But you have no idea what it's
like to work your butt off
For something and have everyone,
even your friends, ignore you.
I am so trying to remember
his name right now.
Artie, tina, brittany and
I are on the brainiacs.
Isn't that the academic
decathlon team?
Wait. We have one of those?
Yes, we do.
And the four of us went
on the smartypants show,
And beat carmel high to go to
the academic decathlon finals
In detroit next week.
What? You guys were on tv?
Well, why didn't you
tell us about it?
All:
We did!
Wait, I... I get the three of
you being on the team...
Is it because two of them are
asian, and artie wears glasses?
No... But brittany?
Liz schneider was our fourth,
but she got rubella.
Her parents are hippies who
don't believe in vaccinations.
Brittany was the only person
we could find on short notice.
Artie:
We bribed her with dots.
That rachel sent to a crack
house was on the other team.
I'll take "deadly cyclones,"
please.
Right on, soul sister.
In 1970...
The bhola cyclone.
Correct again.
Artie: Luckily, we had
our own secret weapon.
I'll take "cat diseases."
I won't!
the first known case
Of this disease was first
diagnosed in calcutta in 2001.
Feline aids?
Rod:
Correct. Bonus question.
Ringworm.
Conjunctivitis.
Kidney failure.
Now, on to our final
speed round question.
Whoever buzzes in first
and answers correctly
Will win the title and go on to
our finals next week in detroit.
Our final category,
"white rappers."
Sadly, we can't afford to go to
the finals, so we're gonna have
To forfeit.
Why don't you just have
your parents pay for it?
Because we shouldn't have to.
We're a school club.
The school should
pay for it.
It's a matter of pride.
You guys are absolutely right.
How much do you need
to make the trip?
With gas and motels,
If we only eat funyuns,
uh, $250.
Which means...
We just need
to sell more taffy.
I'm sure you're wondering why
I called you all together here
In the dead of night,
When I'm normally out
bow-hunting for hobos.
Dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.
Sandy ryerson,
Defrocked educator
and legendary friend of dorothy.
Terri schuester, shrew.
I'm also an assistant manager.
We all have one
very important thing in common.
We all hate will schuester.
I have a question.
Are you single?
Uh, I'm not gay.
I don't care. You're hunky,
and I'm what they call
"predatory gay."
I'll admit I've been on
a bit of a losing streak,
Having lost regionals, and if
will schuster wins at nationals,
My role as reigning champion
At this school will be usurped.
I'm asking you for your help.
Our mission?
To destroy the Glee club.
We'll target their fragile sense
of self-esteem
So that they implode long before
they can make it to nationals.
And I call this union...
...The league of doom.
Ooh.
Okay, first of all,
that is a ridiculous name.
And second of all,
what kind of a meeting
Doesn't have bagels
or something?
Wow, it would be hard
to be married to you.
And for the record?
Or mixed nuts...
I am trying to move
on with my life.
I don't hate will schuester.
But you do hate the Glee club.
That's true. I do.
And I am looking
for a new hobby.
Henceforth, you will be known
By the following
super villain nicknames.
Sandy ryerson,
you are the pink dagger.
Yes!
You are the honey badger,
Nature's most ferocious animal.
Look it up on youtube.
Dustin goolsby?
Sergeant handsome.
My codename
Will be general Zod.
Hold up.
I coach the winningest
Glee club in history.
We're a lock to beat mckinley
at nationals as it is.
Why would I want
to get involved in this?
Well, because, sergeant, you
strike me as a bit of a tool
Who enjoys playing mind games
with your opponents.
That's true.
I really do like doing that.
Legion of evil?
League of doom.
You can count me in.
Although I am enjoying
my second career
As a small-time
medical marijuana dealer.
Okey-dokey.
It doesn't change the fact
That william took my job.
Here are your beepers.
You will await
further instructions.
And until then,
we will be known only as...
The legion of evil.
I don't think I was listening
when you said what our name was.
Wait a second. Is it
"league" or "legion"?
Worst henchmen ever.
I missed you so
much last week.
So what do you want
to do tomorrow night?
Whoa, there, cowboy, we haven't
even had our pizza yet.
I'm just trying
to get you when I can.
You know, this is actually
The first relationship
I've had where the girl
Hasn't been all over me
to spend more time with her.
Well, get used to it.
I'm a sub.
I'm a rolling stone.
I warned you that being in
a relationship with me meant
Being in a constant
state of wanting.
I am both awesome and
unavailable at the same time.
You're kind of awesome.
What do you think about
my taffy sale plan
To send the brainiacs
to detroit?
Um, I think it's
as terrible as the word
"brainiacs," but...
Oh, okay. Here's
your problem, all right?
You're thinking
too small, okay?
That crazy ex-wife of yours
messed with your brain
And now you think
you can't dream.
Okay. Well,
what's your idea?
A night of neglect.
That actually sounds
like life with my ex-wife.
Hilarious. No, seriously,
here's what you need to do.
Have a benefit.
You know how they do on tv when
there's, like, an earthquake,
Or they want to raise money
for, like, a sad disease.
That's actually
a really good idea.
I know it is.
See, your kids are feeling
really neglected, right?
So you fill the auditorium
with people who are there
To hear them sing, and poof!
Oh, I'm loving this.
And we can sell tickets.
And it is a perfect place
to practice for nationals.
And you know the best part?
We're only going to do songs
by neglected artists.
Because it's
"a night of neglect."
Can you define what you mean
by "neglected artist"?
Um, someone whose brilliance
isn't always appreciated.
Oh, so you mean like me.
I mean, like all of us.
All right, everyone,
next Saturday night,
In our auditorium,
Mckinley high's first annual
"night of neglect" fund-raiser
benefit is officially a go!
Sergeant handsome,
walk with me.
I'm surprised
you even saw me.
I was blending in
pretty well back there.
Here's your mission. Word on
the street is that schuester
And that substitute
holly holliday are official.
I need you to
break them up.
She's looser than a
thrift store turtleneck
And probably
just as diseased.
Just my type.
Psst! Ready for my
close-up, general zog.
Sandy, how do you manage
to enter a building
Without setting off
all the fire alarms?
You know, I have to say, with
all this sneaking around,
I have never
felt more alive.
What's my assignment?
Pink dagger, I just learned
That the Glee club
is performing a benefit concert.
It's just
the opening we need.
There's a student club
I want you to sponsor.
Heckling.
The world's
second oldest profession.
Hell am I doing in here?
Good. Louder.
In olden times,
Hecklers provided
a needed service
To the medieval community.
Pink dagger, if I may.
Welcome to the very first
meeting of the heckling club.
You set me up.
You told me
I was supposed to come here
to get homework help.
Congratulations. You're all in.
I'm really confused.
I'm totally doing lykke li.
She's bjork meets
florence and the machine,
And a promising new talent.
What about you, mike?
The mike chang dance dance
revolution.
I'm tired of my dancing
being overshadowed
By all of you
guys' singing.
It's going to be just me
and my sweet moves
On that stage.
You're forgetting about
the most neglected artist
This Glee club's
ever seen--
Aretha franklin.
Neglected?
She's, like, the queen of soul.
See, I auditioned for this club
Singing "respect,"
and she's gotten none since.
So I'm doing aretha.
Awesome, mercedes.
Awesome, all of you guys.
Those songs are great appetizers
to my main course.
Celine dion's "my
heart will go on."
It's gonna be our finale.
That's like the biggest
song of all time.
No. You don't understand.
Celine isn't the
neglected artist, I am.
I was kind of hoping
to do the closing number.
Hey, you guys remember
sunshine corazon?
You are a terrible spy.
Seriously, with your size,
You easily could have stayed
in the air ducts for days.
I'm not a spy.
I heard about your benefit
concert on facebook,
And I wanted to perform.
I know what it feels like
to be in academic decathlon.
No one pays attention to you.
No one cares.
It's not right.
We study so hard.
Yeah, but you're
in vocal adrenaline.
How do we know
we can trust you?
Because I have nothing
against any of you.
I have 600 twitter followers.
I can get all of them to come.
How many tickets
have we sold so far?
Four. No one's interested.
It's just sad.
Please, just let me
show you what I can do.
I would like to sing
the perfect song about neglect,
"all by myself."
I'm such a better singer
than everyone else,
So I know how it feels.
I'm all alone at the top.
Also, I'm really short. So even
when I'm in a group of people,
It feels like I'm wandering
alone through a forest.
There's no way that she's
singing in our auditorium, okay?
She's the enemy.
I say we give her a chance. I
mean, you owe her, rachel.
You sent her to a
frickin' crack house.
when I was young
I never needed anyone
and making love
was just for fun
those days are gone
living alone
I think
of all the friends I've known
when I dial the telephone
nobody's home
all by myself
don't wanna be
all by myself
anymore
all by myself
don't wanna live
all by myself
anymore...
Go on, now!
don't wanna live by myself,
by myself anymore
by myself
anymore
whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh.
come on!
So, can I perform with you guys?
Absolutely not.
She's just trying
To get on our good sides
so she can spy on us.
You're one to talk. We told you
The same thing
about jesse st. James last year.
And you were right!
Finn:
This whole thing
Isn't about us. It's about
helping the brainiacs.
Puck:
Yeah, we need sunshine's
Twitter followers to
come and pay for tickets,
Or there's no point in
having a benefit at all.
Fine. Mercedes,
you're okay with being bumped
To the decidedly less glamorous
middle spot.
Right?
Um... Sure, I guess.
Absolutely.
Hey, mercedes, can
I have your shoes?
I promise to give you a dirty
pair of my flip-flops in return.
Do you know how hard it is
To find high-top, yellow
patent leather sneakers?
Really? I'm surprised
You didn't just give them
to me, considering
How little you
think of yourself.
You're the most talented singer
in Glee club,
Yet you're constantly taking
the backseat to everyone.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'm-I'm tired of fighting
with rachel all the time.
Okay, you're always singing
about r-e-s-p-e-c-t,
But respect isn't something
you can ask for.
You have to demand it.
And you deserve it.
You don't seem to have trouble
in that department.
Right.
You know what?
Neither does aretha
or j-lo or mariah.
You know why? Because
they get proof every day.
I heard mariah
makes appointments at 9:00 a.M.,
And shows up at 4:00
in the afternoon
Because she knows
people will wait.
But those kinds
of demands are ridiculous.
Exactly. But once
you see that no matter
How ridiculous your demands,
people will meet them,
You know
you have it.
Have what?
Respect. And as your manager,
I'd say you're
thinking too small.
Wait a minute.
Since when are you my manager?
Since you agreed to
give me ten percent
Of whatever we can come
up with to ask for.
Sister, you got yourself a deal.
Are you okay?
Yup. I will be as soon
as this counter's really clean.
I hear that ocd symptoms
tend to get worse
When the person
is under great stress.
Carl's gone.
He asked for an annulment,
Which I guess
He's legally entitled to,
Considering we never actually
consummated the marriage.
You guys never...?
At what age are you allowed
To look back on your life
with nothing but regret?
Is 32 too young?
I actually believed
That I'd have a handle
on my ocd by now.
It's just been so long, and...
I'm so tired.
This your lunch?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
One day, you're going to find
a way to beat this thing.
Until then,
I'm here for you.
No judgment.
Just...
A friend that you can count on.
Cheers.
Finn:
So, uh, the braniacs
Asked us to be benefit heads
for the night of neglect.
Quinn:
And we would like to select you
Head of talent relations.
We figured
you're probably used to relating
To talent
because you're so talented.
Well, first, I'm honored
that you came to me,
But I think it's a little
insensitive of you to be
Flaunting your
dating in my face.
Fantastic.
'cause we are having problems
with one of our performers.
I need a bowl of green m&Ms.
And by bowl, I mean large bowl.
Well, really a small barrel.
O... Kay.
I need humidifiers.
Lots of humidifiers.
A team of humidifiers
Whose only job is to make
The air that mercedes
breathes more humid.
We'll try our best.
Shh. I'm not finished.
Before every performance,
I like to wash my hands.
And after doing so, I like to
dry them on a fresh puppy.
Excuse me?
I believe you heard Ms. Jones.
In fact, if I were you, I'd
probably get a whole litter
Of fluffy puppies, just in case
she decides
To take a post-show shower.
Stars make demands
the way that babies
Make messes in their diapers.
They can't help it.
What a star wants is
To just feel appreciated
and respected.
They just want to feel
like they're being heard.
She seemed pretty serious
about the puppy.
Well, obviously, hers is a
talent that we have neglected.
I can relate.
So leave it to me.
I'll take care of it.
:
Hello, class.
I am the world's most famous
and stylish divorcee
Wallace simpson.
I was married a bunch of times,
and then I fell in love
With edward viii and made him
abdicate the throne.
I had giant hands,
so a lot of people thought
I was a hermaphrodite, but
that wasn't true. Others said
I was a nazi sympathizer.
Boy, did I think
that hitler showed promise!
:
Tomorrow we're gonna do
Catherine the great and her pet
stallion fred, so come early.
We haven't been
introduced.
I'm dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.
Oh.
So you're the big
competition at nationals.
Well, thank you very much
for volunteering your star
For our night
of neglect benefit.
What are you talking about?
I never approved that.
Let me cut to
the sexy chase.
Think about how
many more years
You have left of
productive ovulating.
Those aren't eggs in
those fallopian tubes.
They're rare,
exotic pearls.
Oh. So you're trying
to seduce me.
Jackpot. This hairline
is 85% my own,
And my sperm count
is off the charts.
Well...
...As tempting as that sounds,
I have a boyfriend.
Yeah, you do now.
Admit it.
I'm handsome,
I'm good-looking, and
I'm easy on the eyes.
Also, I'm gorgeous.
And I'm dating
will schuester.
Let me tell you something
about will schuester.
That guy has
tiny baby hands.
Seriously. It's weird.
Once I saw him try to pick up a
big mac, and he couldn't do it.
He had to eat it
layer by layer.
Teeny, tiny, wee
Baby hands.
That are big enough
to knock your teeth out.
Well, this is awkward.
Consider my offer.
What offer?
He was just
hitting on me.
Isn't that silly?
What's wrong?
Well, we were supposed to have
lunch, and you don't show.
And now you're getting hit on
by the coach of our archrival.
How is that my fault?
And by the way, I did
show up for lunch,
And you looked like
you were actually having
A pretty good time.
I kind of felt
like I was intruding, so...
Oh, man. I am...
I am not the jealous type, will.
Neither am I.
Look, how about instead
of a pointless argument,
We rehearse our duet
for the benefit?
I really don't, uh, feel in the
mood to do a duet right now.
I think I just have
to clear my head.
Uh, no problem.
I'll see you at the benefit.
Well, as you can see,
we have followed
Your exact specifications.
Wait, where's my puppy?
She specifically
asked for a puppy.
Mercedes:
This is unbelievable.
How am I supposed
to work like this?
Don't worry. Puckerman is
Out right now scouring pounds
for the perfect pomeranian.
Good. This is almost
worthy of the artist
Doing the closing
number at the benefit.
Well, actually, um, sunshine
Is going to be doing
the last number, because
She's bringing in hundreds
of people.
And so, I'll go on
Before sunshine
because, I'm, well, me,
And, uh, Ms. Holliday and
mercedes will go on before me.
Fine.
But Ms. Jones isn't
happy about it.
In exchange, she's demanding
That during the day
of the benefit, her feet
Never touch
the ground.
Excuse me?
Oh, did you not see
celine's wedding?
Carried in.
Cher's comeback tour?
Carried in.
Gaga at the grammys?
Carried the hell in.
Um, I'm sorry. Are-are
You saying that you want to be
carried in in a giant egg?
We'll get back to you.
And that was
the spanish classroom.
And of course,
you know the choir room.
Brittany:
Hey, you guys, you better
Get in the auditorium.
The show's about to start.
It's going to be a
full house, ya'll.
Got to get there early
to get a good seat.
We'll be there in a minute.
I'm just showing blaine around.
Thanks for coming and
supporting us, guys.
It's really cool.
Bye.
Oh, you miss them.
What the hell
are you two doing here?
We're here for the benefit.
Don't tell me you're going.
I wouldn't be caught dead.
I was pumping iron
in the gym,
And one of the guys told me
you two were here
Spreading your fairy dust
all over the place.
Would you just give it up?
You can live whatever lie
you want, but don't pretend
The three of us don't know
what's really going on here.
You don't know squat, butt boy.
Hey, no, guys, stop!
Real brave with your fists,
But you're a coward when
it comes to the truth.
Truth about what?
It's none
of your business, j.Lo.
First of all, anything
you do became my business
When you decided to toss
that slushee up in my grill.
I think I can take a couple
of queers and a girl.
okay.
See, here's what's gonna
go down. Two choices.
You stay here,
and I crack one of your nuts--
Right or left, that's your
choice-- or you walk away,
And live to be a
douchebag another day.
Oh, and also, I have
razorblades hidden in my hair.
Mm-hmm. Tons.
Just all up in there.
Mm-hmm.
We could have
handled that.
It was more fun
doing it together.
Oh, crap.
Glee club:
la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la
Hold up, hold up.
This just in.
According to
sunshine's twitter,
She's not coming, and neither
are any of her followers.
I told you. She's evil.
I was just in the auditorium.
There's, like,
six people in there.
I say we blow this whole thing
off and hit the arcade.
No. No. Screw that.
These people paid
to see us sing.
What's that saying?
The show's got to go all over
the place or something.
You mean, "the show must go on."
yeah.
Finn's right, you guys.
Okay, whether there's
six or 6,000 people,
Out there, we still have
to give it our all.
Okay, tina,
you're up first.
oh, I beg you
can I follow?
You suck!
Where's rachel berry?
be my only
Show tunes! Show tunes!
Show tunes!
be the water
where I'm wading
You make me barf!
running high
run deep, run wild
oh, I'll follow,
I'll follow you
deep sea, baby
Boo!
Azimio:
Damn, is this even music?
oh, oh, oh
Boo! Kiss my ass!
oh, oh
I can't take this!
I can't stand this!
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh.
:
Boo!
Boo!
It's the worst I've ever felt
in my entire life.
I didn't think
it was possible
For people to
hate us even more.
We're calling this off.
Guys, I hate to say it,
but I think we have to buck up.
Tina, I'm sorry you had
to go through that,
But it's actually a really good
lesson for us.
I mean, that's
a part of show business, guys.
Sometimes people
can be really mean.
Think about
what's going to happen
If we have an unfriendly crowd
at nationals in new york.
And I'm sure there's going
To be some vocal adrenaline
hecklers there, too.
We need to find some strength
and barrel through this.
I think I may know a way
to shut those hecklers up
For a number or two.
Take as much
as you want.
Thanks, babe.
I'll take two.
And remember,
Vote quinn fabray
for prom queen.
Sam: And now,
please enjoy the dance stylings
Of mr. Mike chang
as he busts some moves
To jack johnson's "bubble toes."
it's as simples as something
that nobody knows
that her eyes are as big
as her bubbly toes
on the feet of a queen
of the hearts of the cards
and her feet are all covered
with tar balls
and so
well, I was eating lunch
at the dlg
when this little girl came
and she sat next to me
never seen nobody move
the way she did
well, she did, and she does,
and she'll do it again
when you move like a
jellyfish, rhythm is nothing
you go with the flow,
you don't stop
hmm
it's as common as something
that nobody knows
that her beauty will follow
wherever she goes
up the hill
in the back of her house
in the wood, she'll love me
forever, I know
she la, da, da, da, da, da
la, da, da, da, da, da, da,
la...
if you would only listen
you might just realize
what you're missing
you're missing me
it's as simple as something
that nobody knows
that her eyes are as big
as her bubbly toes
on the feet of a queen
of the hearts of the cards
he feet are infested
with tar balls
and la, da, da, da, da, da
la, da, da, da, da, da, da
la, da, da,
da, da, da
la, da, da, da, da, da, da,
da...
Bravo!
Whoo!
Yeah!
That was all kinds of awesome.
Yeah!
Terrific job, mike.
Whoo!
Hey, sounds like the heckling
club loved our refreshments.
Yeah, but we're almost
out of that taffy.
How are we going to keep them
From going after us again
after the intermission?
By being so good
that they can't heckle us.
And I know just
the person for the job.
W-where's mercedes?
She's up.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Jones has not appreciated
The way she's been treated
And is refusing to go on.
let me talk to her.
Don't bother. Mercedes
has left the building.
Okay, you guys,
go find mercedes.
I'm gonna go deal
with the haters.
Are we in trouble?
Oh, no. Not at all.
I was just taking the
opportunity of intermission
To tell you guys
what great hecklers you are.
You must practice a lot.
No, not that much.
Just on the internet only.
You know, my posts on NCIS
and CSI: Miami chat rooms
Are legendary.
You're kidding.
I've never seen you on there.
You wouldn't. Because I post as
"ncisucks" or "ncistupid."
I'm "the beckster" on the
entertainment weekly chatrooms.
And my "curlyhairincairo"
twitter account
Helped bring down mubarak.
Technology has allowed us
to be brutally cruel
Without suffering
any consequences.
In the past, if I wanted to tell
someone they sucked,
I'd have to say it
to their face,
Which would usually result
In them kicking
me in the groin.
I get it. We live
in a culture of insults.
I mean, we're constantly
bombarded with these
Images of people who are richer
than us, and happier than us,
And have more interesting
sex than us, and it
makes us feel terrible.
Preach.
You know, we tear them down
to feel better about ourselves.
And we don't just stop
with the people who are on tv
Or in magazines,
we do it to everybody.
And we think that because
it's done anonymously,
There are no ramifications.
But there are ramifications,
guys.
Because it makes you comfortable
with insensitivity.
Do you know that one of
the girls you heckled tonight
Has been crying for an hour?
Are you saying
you never ragged on anybody?
Oh, of course I did.
I spent three years
Sending hate mail
to debbie gibson
Until she wrote
me back and said
That the stress of my letters
was giving her alopecia.
And then I felt terrible
Because I realized
it was just my jealousy
That she could fill a mall
with her adoring fans.
You guys are great kids.
Some of those insults were rad.
But just think about how
you could lift up the world
If you turned some
of those barbs into roses.
I mean, intermission's almost
over. Why don't you get back
In there and turn some of that
jeering into cheering?
Na, no. I think
I'm just going to go home,
Probably do a new post about
how handsome mark harmon is.
Me, too. I'm out.
I'm splitting, too.
They say, "if you have nothing
nice to say..."
I'll be 18 in three years.
Wait for me?
Let me in. Let me in.
Come on. It's raining.
We've all been
looking for you.
Don't bother with the pep talk.
I'm not going back in there.
My demands were not met.
Have you ever read anything
about aretha franklin?
She was a gospel singer.
And one day, she went
to this-this show.
Nothing fancy. It was
just, like, a state fair.
And the master
of ceremonies
Hands her a tiara and calls
her the queen of soul.
And that's
how she earned her crown.
That's how she gained
all of her respect.
Not by-by requesting
for special pillows,
Or-or food, but...
For doing what she does best:
Singing.
I just don't get it.
Why are you
a bigger star than me?
You always get
the big solos,
The best songs,
the moments in the sun.
Why is it never me?
I don't know.
I mean, you're just as good
of a singer as I am.
Yeah.
And everyone actually likes me.
That's your problem.
Because I would rather
be a star than be liked.
And-and...
I'm not saying
that it's healthy,
And I'm not saying that it's
better than being loved,
But there's nothing--
For the chance
to be in the spotlight.
I just...
Really wanted that closing slot.
Well, if you want
that closing slot,
Then go in there
and take it from me.
Where is everybody?
Let's get on with it.
You're a really horrible
person, you know that?
You sound like my
court-appointed therapist.
Pink dagger, I'm going to need
to speak with you right now.
Yes, general.
You know, I had a feeling
you might be behind this.
You have no proof.
Sam:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Miss holly holliday.
close enough to start a war
all that I have
is on the floor
god only knows
what we're fighting for
all that I say
you always say more
I can't keep up
with your turning tables
under your thumb
I can't breathe
so I won't let you close
enough to hurt me
no, I won't ask you
you to just desert me
I can't give you
what you think you gave me
it's time to say good-bye
to turning tables
to turning tables
next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
when the thunder
calls for me
next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
standing on my own two feet
I won't let you
close enough to hurt me
no, I won't ask you
you to just desert me
I can't give you
what you think
you gave me
it's time to say good-bye
to turning tables
to turning tables
turning tables
yeah, yeah
turning
yeah...
I'm a fantastic super villain.
Sandy, I just saw
Jacob ben israel, azimio
And becky jackson leave the
benefit they were supposed to be
Ruining together in a car with
the license plate "jewfro."
I lost track of 'em.
I went into the bathroom,
when I came out, they were gone.
I was applying
a light coat of powder
And practicing catch phrases
To use when I really
take someone down a peg.
Like?
You just got poked.
Poked by the dagger!
Your job was to
crush their spirit,
And had you done
that, they would have
Closed up shop
by intermission.
Now get back in
there and question
The whole purpose
of arts education.
I'm getting back in there.
That Glee club's not
gonna know what hit 'em!
I tried,
but I don't think she's coming.
I need to start warming up.
Lauren, you're her manager.
Why don't you do something?
See, my client, Ms. Jones,
is not picking up her phone.
Oh.
So...
Miss jones is fine.
Wait. Shouldn't one of us
be carrying you in?
I have only one
more demand.
I demand
That all of you get your butts
out there and watch me sing.
Hallelujah!
You heard the woman.
Let's go.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Mercedes jones.
Oh, dear god, I love this song.
ain't no way
for me to love you
if you won't let me
oh, no
I know that a woman's duty
is to help and love a man
and that's the way
it was planned
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
it ain't no way
it ain't no way
it just ain't no way, baby
ain't no way, baby
it ain't no way
for me to love you
if you won't let me
stop trying to be
someone you're not
and if you need me
oh, oh, oh
to love you
say
say
say, say
say
you do
you do
oh, then baby, baby, baby
don't you know
that I need you?
ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't
no way, it ain't no way
it ain't no way, baby
no
it just ain't no way
it sure ain't no way
it ain't no way
for me to love you
if you won't
let me.
Oh.
All right, girl,
time for the closing number.
Go bring the house down.
Are you kidding me?
Nobody could follow that.
Okay, the house has been
brought down.
Bye. Hey, hot stuff.
Hey.
How are the kids doing?
They were amazeballs
tonight, right?
Yeah, they're good.
Everyone's in the choir room,
and they all want to thank you
For helping out with the benefit
and the hecklers and...
Why were you in the janitor's
closet with the door closed?
Okay, 'cause I'm a sub,
And that's the office
that figgins gives me.
Guess what?
I just got offered a job
to teach french in cleveland.
Isn't that great?
Full time?
No. Who are you talking to?
Four months, tops.
Don't you have any feelings
about leaving?
Didn't you listen to my song?
I told you, will.
I live the glamorous life
Of a substitute teacher,
And I'm deathly allergic
to commitment.
You knew that this
was going to end this way.
Yeah.
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
You're too nice for me.
But you broke my record.
Five dates.
Are you counting that one
We had in the janitor's
closet yesterday?
That was my favorite one.
Mine, too.
You think
you're ever gonna settle down?
Maybe.
But not with you.
You're in love
with somebody else,
And thanks to my counseling,
she's available now.
And by the way,
she's totally into you, too.
Holly?
Will you come
back and visit?
:
I thought you'd never ask.
Sandy, what are
you doing in here?
I tried to be a hater,
but I just couldn't do it.
That song and the weed
I smoked immediately prior--
It gave me
A change of heart.
Mr. Ryerson offered
to pay for our trip.
bring it!
It's drug money, but you know,
It's actually a fantastic way
to launder it.
Good-bye, william.
I miss the arts, I really do.
You just got poked.
Poked by the dagger!
All :
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!
This is a disaster.
Pink dagger, not
only did you fail
To disrupt the
night of neglect.
You funded it in full.
In fact,
you were its only donor.
Aretha is my kryptonite.
Sergeant handsome,
What do you have
to say for yourself?
Hey, I did get them to break up.
Who knew it was gonna be
Amicable, and sort of have
nothing to do with me? I pulled
Sunshine out of the benefit.
Don't I get credit for that?
No. In my hour of need,
honey badger, I turn to you.
Your time has come.
Well, at the end of regulation,
we're all tied up.
Excuse me, mr. Remington?
We would just like to say hi
to our friends in Glee club.
We love you guys.
Love you.
And now...
Love you.
...The tie-breaker question.
