CLOPIN:
Listen. They're beautiful, no?
So many colors of sound,
so many changing moods.
Because you know they don't
ring all by themselves.
- PUPPET: They don't?
- No, you silly boy.
Up there,
high, high in the dark bell tower,
lives the mysterious bell ringer.
- Who is this creature?
- PUPPET: Who?
- What is he?
- PUPPET: What?
- How did he come to be there?
- PUPPET: How?
- Hush.
- PUPPET: Ow.
Clopin will tell you.
It is a tale, a tale of a man...
And a monster.
- Shut it up, will you?
- We'll be spotted!
Hush, little one.
Four guilders
for safe passage into Paris.
Judge Claude Frollo!
CHOIR:
CLOPIN:
CHOIR:
CLOPIN:
Bring these gypsy vermin
to the palace of justice.
You there! What are you hiding?
Stolen goods, no doubt.
Take them from her.
She ran.
CHOIR:
Dies illa
Dies illa
Sanctuary! Please, give us sanctuary!
A baby?
A monster!
Dies irae
Dies irae
"Stop!" cried the archdeacon.
This is an unholy demon.
I'm sending it back to hell,
where it belongs.
I am guiltless. She ran. I pursued.
My conscience is clear.
You can lie to yourself
and your minions
Nor hide what you've done
from the eyes
CHOIR:
CLOPIN:
CHOIR:
CLOPIN:
What must I do?
Care for the child
and raise it as your own.
What? I am to be saddled
with this misshapen...
Very well.
But let him live with you in your church.
Live here? Where?
Anywhere.
The bell tower, perhaps.
And who knows? Our Lord works
in mysterious ways.
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name,
a name that means "half-formed."
Quasimodo.
Sing the bells, bells
Bells, bells
Bells, bells
Bells, bells
Good morning.
Will today be the day?
Are you ready to fly?
You sure? Good day to try.
Why, if I picked a day to fly,
oh, this would be it.
The Festival of Fools.
It will be fun with jugglers
and music and dancing.
Go on. Nobody wants
to be cooped up here forever.
Oh, man!
I thought he'd never leave.
I'll be spittin' feathers for a week.
Well, that's what you get
for sleeping with your mouth open.
Go scare a nun.
Hey, Quasi, what's goin' on out there?
- A fight? A flogging?
- A festival.
- You mean a Feast of Fools?
- Uh-huh.
All right, all right!
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.
It is a treat to watch the colorful
pageantry of the simple peasant folk.
Boy, nothin' like balcony seats
for watching the ol' FOF.
Yeah, watchin'.
Oh, look. A mime.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What gives?
Aren't you
going to watch the festival with us?
- I don't get it.
- Perhaps he's sick.
LAVERNE: Impossible.
If 20 years of listenin' to you two hasn't
made him sick by now, nothin' will.
Watching the Festival of Fools
has always been the highlight
of the year for Quasimodo.
What good is watchin' the party
if you never get to go?
Here, get away from me!
Go on, ya bunch of buzzards!
He's not made of stone, like us.
Quasi, what's wrong?
You want to tell ol' Laverne all about it?
I just don't feel
like watching the festival, that's all.
Well, did ya ever think
of goin' there instead?
Sure. But I'd never fit in out there.
I'm not normal.
Oh, Quasi, Quasi, Quasi.
Do ya mind?
I would like to have a moment
with the boy, if it's all right with you!
Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower.
What do we gotta do, paint ya a fresco?
As your friends and guardians,
we insist you attend the festival.
- Me?
- No, the pope. Of course, you!
It would be a veritable potpourri
of educational experience.
Wine, women and song.
You can learn to identify
various regional cheeses.
- Bobbin' for snails.
- Study indigenous folk music.
Playin' dunk the monk!
Quasi, take it from an old spectator.
Life's not a spectator sport.
If watchin' is all you're gonna do,
then you're gonna watch
your life go by without ya.
Yeah, you're human, with the flesh
and the hair and the navel lint.
We're just part of the architecture.
Right, Victor?
Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake?
If you moisten us, do we not grow moss?
Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic
and a clean pair of hose, and...
Thanks for the encouragement.
But you're all forgetting one big thing.
GARGOYLES: What?
My master, Frollo.
GARGOYLES: Oh.
VICTOR: Yeah. Oh, dear, yes.
Well, when he says you're forbidden
from ever leaving the bell tower,
does he mean "ever, " ever?
Never ever.
And he hates the Feast of Fools.
- He'd be furious if I asked to go.
- Who says ya gotta ask?
- Oh, no.
- Ya sneak out.
- It's just one afternoon.
- I couldn't.
And ya sneak back in.
- He'll never know you were gone.
- And if I got caught?
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.
He might see me.
You could wear a disguise.
Just this once.
What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt ya.
- Ignorance is bliss.
- Look who's talkin'.
Nobody wants to stay
cooped up here forever.
You're right. I'll go.
- I'll get cleaned up.
- Yes, sir!
- I'll stroll down those stairs.
- There ya go!
I'll march through the doors and...
Good morning, Quasimodo.
Oh, good morning, Master.
Dear boy, whomever are you talking to?
My friends.
I see. And what are your
friends made of, Quasimodo?
Stone.
- Can stone talk?
- No, it can't.
That's right. You're a smart lad.
Now, lunch.
Shall we review your alphabet today?
Oh, yes, Master.
I would like that very much.
- Very well. "A"?
- Abomination.
- "B"?
- Blasphemy.
- "C"?
- Contrition.
- "D"?
- Damnation.
- "E"?
- Eternal damnation.
- Good. "F"?
- Festival.
Excuse me?
- Forgiveness.
- You said, "Festival."
- No!
You are thinking
about going to the festival.
It's just that you go every year.
I am a public official. I must go.
But I don't enjoy a moment.
Thieves and cutpurses,
the dregs of humankind,
all mixed together
in a shallow, drunken stupor.
I didn't mean to upset you, Master.
Quasimodo, can't you understand?
When your heartless mother
abandoned you as a child,
anyone else would have drowned you.
And this is my thanks for taking you in
and raising you as my son?
I'm sorry, sir.
Oh, my dear Quasimodo.
You don't know what it's like out there.
I do. I do.
Remember what
I've taught you, Quasimodo.
- QUASIMODO:
- FROLLO:
You are good to me, Master.
- I'm sorry.
- You are forgiven.
But, remember, Quasimodo,
this is your sanctuary.
My sanctuary.
Knowing them
as they will never know me
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent
One day
Hmm. Uh-uh.
You leave town for a couple of decades,
and they change everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for
the palace of justice. Would you...
Mmm. I guess not.
Ah!
Stay away, child. They're gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.
All right, gypsy.
- Where'd ya get the money?
- For your information, I earned it.
- Gypsies don't earn money.
- They steal it.
You'd know a lot about stealing.
Troublemaker, eh?
Maybe a day in the stocks
will cool ya down.
Oof!
Come back here, gypsy!
Achilles, sit.
Hey! Whoa!
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
Naughty horse! Naughty!
He's just impossible.
Really, I can't take him anywhere.
Get this thing off me!
I'll teach you a lesson, peasant!
You were saying, Lieutenant?
Oh, Captain!
Ow!
At your service, sir!
I know you have a lot
on your mind right now,
but the palace of justice?
- Make way for the captain!
- Go on, make way!
SOLDIER 1: Make way!
Everybody out of the way!
SOLDIER 2: You,
make way for the captain!
SOLDIER 1: Make way!
SOLDIER 2: Make way, now!
Come on, boy. Achilles, heel!
- FROLLO: Stop.
- Sir?
Ease up. Wait between lashes.
Otherwise the old sting
will dull him to the new.
Yes, sir.
Ah, so this is the gallant
Captain Phoebus, home from the wars.
Reporting for duty, as ordered, sir.
Your service record
precedes you, Phoebus.
I expect nothing but the best
from a war hero of your caliber.
And you shall have it, sir. I guarantee it.
Yes.
You know, my last captain of the guard
was a bit of a disappointment to me.
Well, no matter.
I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape.
Uh, thank you.
It's a tremendous honor, sir.
FROLLO: You've come to Paris
in her darkest hour, Captain.
It will take a firm hand
to save the weak-minded
- from being so easily misled.
- Misled, sir?
Look, Captain. Gypsies.
The gypsies live outside
the normal order.
Their heathen ways inflame
the people's lowest instincts.
And they must be stopped.
I was summoned from the wars
to capture fortune tellers
and palm readers?
Oh, the real war, Captain,
is what you see before you.
For 20 years, I have been
taking care of the gypsies,
one by one.
And yet, for all my success,
they have thrived.
I believe they have a safe haven
within the walls of this very city.
A nest, if you will.
They call it the court of miracles.
What are we going to do about it, sir?
You make your point quite vividly, sir.
You know, I like you, Captain. Shall we?
Oh, duty calls.
Have you ever attended
a peasant festival, Captain?
Not recently, sir.
Then this should be
quite an education for you.
Come along.
CROWD:
CROWD:
- CLOPIN:
CLOPIN:
Whoa!
Hey! Are you all right?
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
Well, you're not hurt, are you?
Here, here, let's see.
- No, no! No!
- There.
See? No harm done.
Just try to be a little more careful.
I will.
By the way, great mask.
CROWD:
CLOPIN:
CROWD:
CLOPIN:
QUASIMODO: Whoa!
Hurry, hurry
Here's your chance
Come, one
Come, all
- Look at that disgusting display.
- Yes, sir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the
Hey!
Why?
CROWD:
CLOPIN:
CROWD:
You could soon be called
your highness
CROWD:
Bleah!
- That's no mask.
- It's his face!
WOMAN: He's hideous!
It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.
We asked for the ugliest face in Paris,
and here it is!
Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame!
CLOPIN: Everybody!
CROWD:
- CLOPIN:
CROWD:
CROWD:
CLOPIN:
ALL: Quasimodo! Quasimodo!
You think he's ugly now? Watch this.
ALL: Quasimodo!
Now that's ugly!
Hail to the king!
SOLDIER: Bon appétit!
Whoa!
MAN: Where are you goin', hunchback?
The fun's just beginning.
Master!
Master, please, help me!
Sir, request permission
to stop this cruelty.
In a moment, Captain.
A lesson needs to be learned here.
Don't be afraid.
I'm sorry.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
You! Gypsy girl!
Get down at once!
Yes, your honor.
Just as soon as I free this poor creature.
I forbid it!
How dare you defy me?
You mistreat this poor boy
the same way you mistreat my people.
You speak of justice, yet you are cruel
to those most in need of your help.
- Silence!
- Justice!
Mark my words, gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.
Then it appears
we've crowned the wrong fool.
The only fool I see is you!
Captain Phoebus, arrest her.
Now, let's see.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?
Witchcraft!
ESMERALDA: Oh, boys. Over here.
SOLDIER 1: There she is!
SOLDIER 2: Get her!
I'm free! I'm free! Ooh!
Dang it.
SOLDIER: Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
What a woman.
Whoa!
Find her, Captain. I want her alive.
Yes, sir. Seal off the area, men.
Find the gypsy girl and do not harm her.
I'm sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.
MAN: Stand back. Stand back.
WOMAN: Oh, he's hideous.
SOLDIER: You, there, get away!
Move on.
Hmm.
You!
Easy, easy. I just shaved this morning.
- Oh, really? You missed a spot.
- All right, all right.
Just calm down.
Just give me a chance to apologize.
For what?
That, for example.
You sneaky son of a...
Ah, ah, ah. Watch it. You're in a church.
Are you always this charming,
or am I just lucky?
Whoa!
Candlelight, privacy, music.
Can't think of a better place
for hand-to-hand combat.
Ooh!
You fight almost as well as a man.
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing about you.
That's hitting a little below the belt,
don't you think?
No. This is.
Ooh!
Touché.
- I didn't know you had a kid.
- Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers.
Uh, I noticed. Uh...
Permit me.
I'm Phoebus. It means "sun god."
- And you are?
- Is this an interrogation?
I believe it's called an introduction.
- You're not arresting me?
- Not as long as you're in here. I can't.
Huh. You're not at all
like the other soldiers.
Thank you.
So, if you're not going to arrest me,
what do you want?
I'd settle for your name.
- Esmeralda.
- Beautiful.
Much better than Phoebus, anyway.
Good work, Captain. Now arrest her.
Claim "sanctuary."
- Say it!
- You tricked me.
I'm waiting, Captain.
I'm sorry, sir. She claimed sanctuary.
There's nothing I can do.
Then drag her outside and...
Frollo, you will not touch her!
Don't worry.
Minister Frollo learned years ago
to respect the sanctity of the church.
All right, all right. I'm going.
You think you've outwitted me.
But I'm a patient man.
And gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.
What are you doing?
I was just imagining a rope
around that beautiful neck.
I know what you were imagining.
Such a clever witch.
So typical of your kind to twist the truth.
To cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.
Well, no matter.
You've chosen a magnificent prison.
But it is a prison, nonetheless.
Set one foot outside, and you're mine.
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.
Don't worry, Djali.
If Frollo thinks he can keep us here,
he's wrong.
Don't act rashly, my child.
You created quite a stir at the festival.
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.
You saw what he did out there,
letting the crowd torture that poor boy.
I thought if just one person
could stand up to him, then...
What do they have against people
who are different, anyway?
You can't right
all the wrongs of this world by yourself.
No one out there is going to help,
that's for sure.
Well, perhaps there's
someone in here who can.
PARISHIONERS:
You! Bell ringer!
What are you doing down here?
Oh!
Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?
Wait.
I want to talk to you.
Look, he's got a friend with him.
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't
a total loss after all.
- A vision of loveliness.
- The one in the dress ain't bad either.
- Way to go, Quasi!
- Congratulations.
- We knew you had it in ya.
- Got the girls chasin' ya already.
Actually, I...
You mustn't run too fast,
or she'll get away.
Yes, I know. That's what I...
Give her some slack, then reel her in.
Then give her some slack,
then reel her in.
- Then give her some slack...
- Knock it off, Hugo.
She's a girl, not a mackerel.
Here you are. I was afraid I'd lost you.
Yes.  Well, I, uh...
I have chores to do.
It was nice seeing you again.
- Oh.
No, wait!
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.
I would never in my life
have pulled you...
Up on the...
Stage.
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.
Did you make all these things yourself?
QUASIMODO: Most of them.
This is beautiful.
If I could do this, you wouldn't find me
dancing in the streets for coins.
But you're a wonderful dancer.
Well, it keeps bread on the table,
anyway. What's this?
Oh, no, please!
I'm not finished.
I still have to paint them.
It's the blacksmith and the baker!
You're a surprising person, Quasimodo.
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.
Well, it's not just me.
There's the gargoyles
and, of course, the bells.
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?
Follow me. I'll introduce you.
- I never knew there were so many.
- That's Little Sophia.
And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.
Triplets, you know.
- And who's this?
- Big Marie.
Hello!
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?
How about it, Djali?
- We'd love to.
- Good.
I've saved the best for last.
ESMERALDA: Oh!
ESMERALDA: I bet the king
himself doesn't have a view like this.
- I could stay up here forever.
- You could, you know.
No, I couldn't.
- Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
- But not freedom.
"Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls."
But you're not like other gypsies.
They are evil.
- Who told you that?
- My master, Frollo.
He raised me.
How can such a cruel man have
raised someone like you?
Cruel? Oh, no.
He saved my life.
He took me in when no one else would.
- I am a monster, you know.
- He told you that?
Look at me.
- Give me your hand. Just let me see it.
- What?
Hmm.
A long lifeline.
Oh, and this one means you're shy.
Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm.
- Well, that's funny.
- What?
- I don't see any...
- Any what?
Monster lines. Not a single one.
Now you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?
No! No, no.
You are kind and good and...
And a gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong
about the both of us.
What did she say?
Frollo's nose is long,
and he wears a truss.
Ha! Told ya! Pay up.
- Oh, dear.
- Chump.
You helped me. Now I will help you.
But there's no way out.
There are soldiers at every door.
We won't use a door.
- You mean, climb down?
- Sure.
- You carry him. I carry you.
- Okay.
Come on, Djali.
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
- Now I'm afraid.
- The trick is not to look down.
ESMERALDA: You've done this before?
QUASIMODO: No.
Ooh!
Wow, you're quite an acrobat.
Thank you.
Whoa!
SOLDIER 1: Check the alley!
SOLDIER 2: This way!
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Not for an instant.
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.
- Come with me.
- What?
To the court of miracles.
Leave this place.
Oh, no.
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.
No. This is where I belong.
All right, then I'll come to see you.
- Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!
- I'll come after sunset.
But at sunset, I ring the evening mass,
and after that I clean the cloisters.
And then I ring the vespers, and...
Whatever is good for you.
If you ever need sanctuary,
this will show you the way.
- But how?
- Just remember.
When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand.
Hurry. You must go.
SOLDIER 1: Check the alley.
SOLDIER 2: Yes, sir. No one here, sir.
SOLDIER 3: No one here, sir.
SOLDIER 1: Check the street.
Hi, there.
I'm looking for the gypsy girl.
Have you seen her?
- Whoa, whoa! Easy!
- No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out!
- Wait! All I want is to...
- Go!
I mean her no harm.
Go!
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here.
But it was the only way
I could save her life.
Will you tell her that? Will you?
If you go. Now.
I'll go.
Now, will you put me down, please?
Oh, and one more thing.
- Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.
- Why?
To have a friend like you.
HUGO: Hey, hey, there he is.
You ejected that tin-plated buffoon
with great panache.
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here,
tryin' to steal your girl.
- My girl?
- Esmeralda.
Dark hair, works with a goat, remember?
Boy, I do. Way to go, lover boy.
"Lover boy"? Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, don't be so modest.
Look, I appreciate
what you're all trying to do.
But let's not fool ourselves.
"Ugliest face in all Paris, " remember?
I don't think I'm her type.
Eh?
- CHOIR:
CHOIR:
CHOIR:
CHOIR:
Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.
- What?
- She's nowhere in the cathedral.
- She's gone.
- But how? Never mind.
Get out, you idiot. I'll find her.
I'll find her if I have to
burn down all of Paris.
Hellfire
Dark fire
Now, gypsy
It's your turn
- CHOIR:
PHOEBUS:
Good morning, sir.
Oh.
Are you feeling all right?
I had a little trouble
with the fireplace.
- I see. Your orders, sir?
- Find the gypsy girl.
Ten pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.
Lock them up.
Twenty pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.
Take them away!
WOMAN: Poor miller.
He's never harmed anyone!
MAN: Frollo's gone mad.
FROLLO: We found this gypsy talisman
on your property.
Have you been harboring gypsies?
Our home is always open
to the weary traveler.
Have mercy, my lord.
I am placing you and your family
under house arrest
until I get to the bottom of this.
If what you say is true
and you are innocent,
then you have nothing to fear.
But we are innocent. I assure you,
we know nothing of these gypsies.
- Burn it.
- What?
Until it smolders.
These people are traitors
and must be made examples of.
With all due respect, sir, I was
not trained to murder the innocent.
But you were trained to follow orders.
Insolent coward.
The sentence
for insubordination is death.
Such a pity.
You threw away a promising career.
Consider it my highest honor, sir.
FROLLO: Get him!
And don't hit my horse!
Don't waste your arrows.
Let the traitor rot in his watery grave.
Find the girl.
If you have to burn the city
to the ground, so be it.
CHOIR:
Sir, we've looked everywhere
and still no sign of the gypsy girl.
I had the entire cathedral surrounded.
Guards at every door. There was
no way she could have escaped.
Unless...
Oh, it doesn't look good.
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
- HUGO: You're tellin' me.
I'm losing' to a bird!
Oh, but that poor gypsy girl.
I'm beginning to fear the worst.
I know. But now don't you say
anything to upset Quasimodo.
He's worried enough already.
Yeah, you're right. We better lighten up.
- Here he comes.
Now just stay calm.
- Not a word.
- Easy does it.
- Stone-faced.
- Any sign of her?
Mmm. Mmm.
Oh, it's a lost cause!
She could be anywhere!
In the stocks,
in the dungeon, on the rack!
Oh!
- Nice work, Victor.
- No, he's right. What are we gonna do?
What are you guys talkin' about?
If I know Esmeralda,
she's three steps ahead of Frollo
and well out of harm's way.
Do you really think so?
Hey, when things cool off,
she'll be back. You'll see.
- What makes you so sure?
- Because she likes ya.
We always said you were the cute one.
I thought I was the cute one.
No, you're the fat, stupid one
with the big mouth!
What are you saying', exactly?
Take it from us, Quasi.
You got nothin' to worry about.
Yeah. You're irresistible.
Knights in shining
armor certainly aren't her type.
And those guys are a dime a dozen.
But you, you're one of a kind. Look.
ALL:
HUGO:
You're aces, kid.
You see that face
Ya don't forget it
That's you.
HUGO:
But Quasi
I feel it
Any moment she'll walk
through that door
ALL:
ESMERALDA: Quasi?
Quasimodo?
Esmeralda?
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!
You've done so much
for me already, my friend.
But I must ask your help one more time.
Yes, anything.
This is Phoebus.
He's wounded and a fugitive like me.
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.
Please, can you hide him?
This way.
- Esmeralda.
- Shh.
You'll hide here
until you're strong enough to move.
Great. I could use a drink.
Ahhh!
Yes. Mmm.
Feels like a 1470 burgundy.
Not a good year.
That family owes you their lives.
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.
Ex-soldier, remember?
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?
You're lucky.
That arrow almost pierced your heart.
I'm not so sure it didn't.
QUASIMODO:
Frollo's coming. You must leave.
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.
Be careful, my friend. Promise
you won't let anything happen to him.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Quick, we gotta stash the stiff.
Oh. Oh, Master,
I didn't think you'd be coming.
I am never too busy to share
a meal with you, dear boy.
I brought a little treat.
Oh!
Is there something troubling you,
Quasimodo?
- Oh. No!
- Oh, but there is.
I know there is.
I think you're hiding something.
Oh, no, Master. I... There's no...
You're not eating, boy.
Mmm.
It's very good. Thank you.
Mmm.
Seeds.
What's different in here?
Nothing. Sir.
Isn't this one new?
It's awfully good.
It looks very much like the gypsy girl.
I know you helped her escape!
And now all Paris is burning
because of you!
She was kind to me, Master.
You idiot!
That wasn't kindness. It was cunning!
She's a gypsy!
Gypsies are not capable of real love!
Think, boy. Think of your mother.
But what chance could
a poor, misshapen child like you
have against her heathen treachery?
Well, never you mind, Quasimodo.
She'll be out of our lives soon enough.
I will free you from her evil spell.
She will torment you no longer.
What do you mean?
I know where her hideout is.
And tomorrow at dawn, I attack
with 1,000 men.
We have to find the court
of miracles before daybreak.
If Frollo gets there first...
Are you coming with me?
- I can't.
- I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.
Frollo is my master.
I can't disobey him again.
She stood up for you. You've got
a funny way of showing gratitude.
Well, I'm not going to sit by and
watch Frollo massacre innocent people.
You do what you think is right.
What? What am I supposed to do?
Go out there and rescue
the girl from the jaws of death,
and the whole town will cheer
like I'm some kind of a hero?
She already has her knight
in shining armor, and it's not me.
Frollo was right.
Frollo was right about everything.
I'm tired of trying to be
something that I'm not.
I must be out of my mind.
- Phoebus! Shh.
- Aah!
- I'm coming with you!
- Glad you changed your mind.
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for her.
You know where she is?
No, but she said
that this will help us find her.
Good, good, good. Ah, great.
What is it?
- I'm not sure.
- Hmm. It must be some sort of code.
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.
"When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand."
- What?
- It's the city.
- What are you talking about?
- It's a map.
See, here's the cathedral and the river,
and this little stone must be...
- I've never seen a map that looks like...
- I've lived in the tower for 20 years.
And I think I know
what the city looks like from above.
- This is it.
- This is not it.
All right. Okay.
If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map.
But if we're going to find Esmeralda,
we have to work together.
Truce?
Well, okay.
Ahh!
Sorry.
PHOEBUS: No, you're not.
This looks like the symbol on the map.
But what does it mean?
Hmm.
I'm not sure.
I can make out an inscription,
but it's going to
take a few minutes to translate it.
Yes, well.
Or we could just go down those stairs.
QUASIMODO:
Is this the court of miracles?
PHOEBUS: Offhand, I'd say it's
the court of ankle-deep sewage.
Must be the old catacombs.
Cheerful place.
Kinda makes ya wish
ya got out more often, eh, Quasi?
Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda
and get back to the bell tower
before I get in more trouble.
Speaking of trouble, we should
have run into some by now.
- What do you mean?
- You know. A guard. A booby trap.
Or an ambush.
Well, well, well. What have we here?
- Trespassers!
- Spies!
- We're not spies.
- You've got to listen...
Don't interrupt me.
You're very clever
to have found our hideaway.
Unfortunately, you won't
live to tell the tale.
Hello, you're there.
We have a method
for spies and intruders
Gather around, everybody.
There's "good noose" tonight.
It's a doubleheader.
A couple of Frollo's spies.
And not just any spies.
His captain of the guard
and his loyal, bell-ringing henchman.
Any last words?
That's what they all say.
- PUPPET:
- Overruled.
- PUPPET: I object.
- Quiet.
- PUPPET: Dang.
ESMERALDA: Stop!
These men aren't spies.
They're our friends.
- Why didn't they say so?
- We did say so.
This is the soldier
who saved the miller's family.
And Quasimodo helped me
escape the cathedral.
We came to warn you. Frollo's coming!
He says he knows where you're hiding,
and he's attacking at dawn
with 1,000 men.
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.
You took a terrible risk coming here.
It may not exactly show,
but we're grateful.
Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo.
Without his help,
I would never have found my way here.
FROLLO: Nor would I.
After 20 years of searching,
the court of miracles is mine at last.
Dear Quasimodo.
I always knew
you would someday be of use to me.
- No.
- What are you talking about?
- Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
- You're a liar.
And look what else
I've caught in my net.
Captain Phoebus, back from the dead.
Another "miracle, " no doubt.
I shall remedy that.
There'll be a little bonfire
in the square tomorrow.
And you're all invited to attend.
Lock them up.
No, please, Master!
No, no.
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.
FROLLO: The prisoner, Esmeralda,
has been found guilty
of the crime of witchcraft.
The sentence...
Death!
The time has come, gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.
Yet even now it is not too late.
I can save you from the flames
of this world and the next.
Choose me. Or the fire.
The gypsy, Esmeralda,
has refused to recant.
This evil witch has put the soul
of every citizen in Paris
in awful jeopardy.
Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it!
- Your friends are down there.
- It's all my fault.
You gotta break these chains.
I can't. I tried.
What difference would it make?
- But you can't let Frollo win!
- He already has.
So you're givin' up? That's it?
These chains aren't what's
holding you back, Quasimodo.
Leave me alone.
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave ya alone.
After all, we're only made out of stone.
We just thought maybe
you were made of somethin' stronger.
FROLLO: For justice, for Paris,
and for her own salvation,
it is my sacred duty
to send this unholy demon
back where she belongs.
No!
Quasimodo!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
- Captain.
- Sir?
Seize the cathedral.
Don't worry. You'll be safe here.
SOLDIER: Charge!
Come back, you cowards!
You, men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.
Alone at last.
Citizens of Paris!
Frollo has persecuted our people,
ransacked our city!
Now he has declared war
on Notre Dame herself!
Will we allow it?
I think the cavalry is here.
Hey, isn't that...
- Uh, Feeble?
- Doofus.
Phoebus!
Sorry. Sorry.
Harder!
Oh! I'm free! I'm free!
Dang it!
VICTOR: Ready, aim, fire!
Are you sure that's how it works?
Works for me.
Achilles, sit.
Ahh! Get off me!
Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly!
Put your backs into it!
Frollo, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate
this assault on the house of God!
Silence, you old fool!
The hunchback and I
have unfinished business to attend to.
And this time you will not interfere.
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!
Come and see.
Esmeralda, wake up.
You're safe now.
Esmeralda?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You killed her.
It was my duty, horrible as it was.
I hope you will forgive me.
There, there, Quasimodo.
I know it hurts.
But now the time has come
to end your suffering...
Forever.
Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo.
No, you listen!
All my life, you have told me
the world is a dark, cruel place.
But now I see that the only thing dark
and cruel about it is people like you.
Quasimodo?
Esmeralda!
She lives.
No!
Leaving so soon?
Look, up there!
Hang on!
I should have known you'd risk your life
to save that gypsy witch,
just as your own mother
died trying to save you.
What?
Now I'm going to do
what I should have done 20 years ago!
Whoa!
Oh!
Hold on.
ESMERALDA: Hold on.
And he shall smite the wicked
and plunge them into the fiery pit!
Quasimodo! Quasi!
No!
Three cheers for Quasimodo!
CROWD:
CLOPIN:
LAVERNE: Don't you ever migrate?
Seems we haven't
Got a prayer
Is the one thing
We all share
Good night, everybody!
