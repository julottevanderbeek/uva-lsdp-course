He'll not come boss.

i Dream.
He's a one man army.
He's the new sun to

He's an unchallenged hero.
He's the fiery hero to give
jitters to the tsunami.
lf time chases me,
l'll attack it.
it chooses war,
l'll win over it.
l'm a thunder...
l'm a lightning...
l'm the fire...

He's the ray of light

Mustering courage from self,

...he's the man of hour.
A road in the Old City...
Second Namaz is in progress...
Has he come?
Watching...matinee show...
Where will you be?
Next street...Red colour Ford.
Be ready.
l'll come immediately
after finishing the job.
Don't delay.
Buy whatever you want.
Kill the bastard, got it?
Don't play with me.
How about these?
Okay...
Okay...be careful.
l want it to be done in 2 days.
lf it is not done...beware...
What else??
Check all over the place.
Bloody killer shouldn't escape!
Look, he's going there.
Bloody! Move man!
No way l'll not move.
Won't they get tired!
They can't jump.
Greetings sir.
Did l made you wait for long?
l've been waiting for
big thing, sit down.
CM is here.
Opinion polls say
he'll make it again.
He shouldn't.
Powerless politician
is like a widow.- Yes sir.
Every man whistles at you.
No value.
Even people like you make them wait.
- No sir...
Just for an example.
This time we must do it,
otherwise no use.
Already press has
forgotten me,
it'll be very difficult
if people too forget me.
Don't get dejected sir.
Let's buy the votes
at Rs. 1000 a vote,
still if we can't make it,
let's supply liquor freely.
They will doze off having your drinks
and not come to vote for you.
That will be better, we can cast
bogus votes ourselves.
lf we as opposition can
rig the polls,
think about what he can do
with the govt. under his control?
Shall we bump him off?
His wife will become CM
in the sympathy wave.
What should we do then?
Kill me!
lf a boy comes home after
failing the tenth class,
everyone at home will scold him.
After seeing the result
if he attempts suicide,
if public bring home
saving his life,
everyone at home
will console him.
ln the first case, people will be
angry on him for failing.
ln the second case,
there will be sympathy for
surviving the suicide attempt.
l want that.
Sympathy!
So, there should be
an attempt on my life.
But l must survive it.
Farooq, our party election
campaign starts on the 10th.
Stage manage an attempt
on my life the same day.
l'll be admitted into a hospital,
TV Channels will cover the news,
few of my supporters will
immolate themselves.
l'll campaign from
my hospital bed.
l'll give an interview
sleeping on the stretcher.
l'll cast my vote going
in a wheelchair.
Excellent! Wheelchair to CM's chair!
lt will cost you heavily sir.
Why?
There are people to kill
for Rs. 1 1 16 also,
they will come from Bihar
to kill and then vanish.
But if you want to survive the attack,
we need professionals.
Don't worry about money,
get the best professional
in the market.
No need to search for him,
he's here only.
Yes sir, Hyderabad has
developed very much.
We get anything we need here.
Who is he?
Not that...- He's here.
What?
- For you sir!
Hello...who is that?
Farooq asked me to contact you.
One minute...talk to him.
Hello...l'm Baji Reddy...go ahead.
Give the phone to Siva Reddy.
We both are one and same.
ls it okay if l kill you
instead of him?
Good joke.
l can shoot well too.
Yes, that is what we want.
Farooq must have told
you everything.
You must make the kill
but the victim must not die.
How much?- 1 .5 crores.
Too much. Any concession?
Shall l kill you as a concession?
Oh no! Thank you.
after finishing the job.
lf l get caught after
finishing the job...?
What if you cheat me...?
l know only to kill
not to cheat.
Okay. l'll give it in one shot.
But it is a formality for us
to meet before the payment.
Not necessary.
lt is necessary for us.
We're giving you 1 .5 crores.
Can't we atleast see your face?
lf you want to see the gun,
nothing wrong.
Want to see the bullet?
You'll be dead.
The payment should be
in the denomination of 1000.
Seal it in a plastic cover and
put it in a red color bag.
Ask your man to take the
Begumpet local train by 9 pm.
Tell him to keep the bag
below the seat & leave.
Did he get down?- No sir.
Keep watching.
He'll get down with
our red color bag.
Follow him, know his whereabouts
and inform me.- Okay sir.
Sorry.- lts okay.
What okay?- Nothing sir.
l said okay to him.
Saw him?- He is not the one.
lf it is not him,
it must be someone else.
You idiot! lt is 1 .5 crores.
lt took me a day to count.
Sir, the train is moving.
Keep watching & it will go away.
Yes sir.- Get into the train.
ls the bag still there?
- Yes sir. But no money.
He must have sat behind me
so that l won't be able to see him.
He has taken the money.
Were you reading a newspaper?
How did you know that?
Nothing new about it.
You were reading the paper and
he walked away with the money.
What do you want me to do now?
Catch a train & finish reading
the remaining newspaper.
Sir...- What?
The bag is torn.
No tension boy.
Bring it here.
We'll get it stitched.
Place of Siva Reddy's assassination...
night...time...
l'll be in that building.
Rent a car from some
unknown person.
Look out for a new travel company.
- l need the license.
Advance Rs. 10000.
The meeting starts at 10:30 am
day after tomorrow.
Wait on the road next
to the building.
To crowd thronging the place,
my brothers and sisters,
party men, district leaders, media
and police, thank you very much.
We very well know how unhappy
you are with the present government.
You paid interest for the
money borrowed by them.
You paid taxes for their wrong doings.
Hail Siva Reddy!
l'm happy to say that Mr.Siva Reddy
will address you shortly.
He is the glimmer of hope
for the minority community.
Hail Siva Reddy!
What will you do for my father?
We'll make him our CM.
Louder please.
Assembly must hear that!
We'll make him our CM.
Now father will address you.
Today l see 2 Hussain Sagars here.
One is flowing under
the tank bunk,
l see the other one flowing here.
When you whistle,
heroes are born.
When you cast vote,
leaders are born.
lf you support one
he becomes a Minister.
Otherwise a wastrel.
When you bless,
leaders live.
When they become despots,
you crush them.
You are the people but
in real mass upheaval.
When you are with me,
no one can dare touch me.
As long as you are with me,
no one can dare touch me.
What happened?- Move.
Call the doctor.
Who killed my father?
Calling control room.
We need more force.
Send it immediately.
Come on, seal the North Block.
Millions in the ground behind.
So, you're left with only 2 options.
Surrender or death.
Which one do you prefer?
Have it.- No thanks.
lts alright, have it.
Tastes good.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Undrajavaram.
l'm going to Basarlapudi,
very famous village.
But you wouldn't have known that.
Do you think l saw that poster
and told you about that village?
That poster is for me.
Don't believe me?
Just a minute...l'll show you.
Pardhu...
Sathyanarayana Murthy
is my grandfather.
The great Basarlapudi, my village.
l took this photo in our
village festival 12 years back.
Forget it.
That's how my fate runs.
l always lose whatever l like.
My parents died when l was a kid.
l left from my grandfather
That's why l'm returning home.
All these 12 years, l was working
for a contractor in Gujarat.
When l came to Hyderabad,
l saw these posters here.
l was surprised.
They are searching me
for the past 12 years,
it means they still remember me.
l felt bad for making them
suffer all these years.
So, l sent a telegram saying
that l'm coming.
By now, everyone must
be eager to see me.
For the first time, l thought flight to
my village would be very good.
l could go reach faster.
Gudivada...Narsapur Express
running 20 minutes late...
Boy, which station is this?
- Railway station.
Gudivada.
People say, you won't get
sleep if you drink coffee.
But l fall asleep as
soon as l've a coffee.
Would you like to have coffee?
l think you're joking.
Don't disturb the passengers.
lt's him. The brown jacket.
l've biscuits in my bag.
They would taste great with coffee.
Shit! l missed.
Quick! Round up the compartment.
He mustn't escape!
Calling all stations.
The killer has escaped.
Alert all stations.
Careful dad.
Wow!
You put it?
You won't even add salt to food.
But you've decorated
the street with Rangoli.
My fiance Pardhu is coming.
WELCOME should be
on the other side.
Yes dad.
She has written WELCOME
in the opposite direction.
lts alright.
lf it is written in that
direction, it means,
''we feel happy on your arrival''.
lf it is in this direction, it means,
''we feel very happy
for your departure''.
lsn't it?
lnstead of writing WELCOME,
BYE would do, huh?
Your father hasn't understood
this concept yet?
Where are you going?
To receive Pardhu.
How will you recognize him?
He would be a young man now.
She's right.
- He will recognize us. Let's go.
But you've grown old.
Oh god! You gave me a Question bank
instead of a daughter.
Come.
You...Pardhu?
Mom, brother-in-law has come.
Mom...
Why are you shouting?
Pardhu has come.
Mom, my fiance has come.
Lalitha, hold this. Careful.
He is very tall.
He is taller than me.
Your aunt.
Didn't recognize her?
Pardhu, where were you
all these days?
He is like his father.
Did you ever wanted to see
us all these years?
We were eagerly waiting for you.
We are very happy now.
Thank god you've come back.
Why don't you say something?
Come Pardhu.
Ward off evil eyes.
- Give it to me.
Why are you standing there?
Come...come here.
She is very shy.
Can't you recognize her? Poori.
Throw it outside.
Come.
l meant the threshold
not the kitchen.
Your mom brought this idol of Rama
from her parents' home.
Happiness or sorrows,
she shared them with him.
She says Lord Rama will
listen to her prayers.
Now that she is in heaven
with Lord Rama,
anything we say to Lord Rama
is saying to your mother.
That's why l brought you here.
Sister-in-law, your Pardhu has come.
Father...
Pardhu...
He has come back home
after so many years.
But you haven't spoken a word.
l've been waiting for him
for the past 12 years.
Can't he wait 10 more
minutes for me to talk?
May be he is hungry.
Give him something to eat. Go.
Couldn't you bring better bananas?
What are they coming for?
To see the girl or bananas?
You talk too much.
Greetings. - Greetings.
Greetings.- Greetings.
Why did you get up?
Please sit down.
We are bride's people,
we've to respect the groom's people.
lt's impossible to talk to him.
Bujji, go & get betel leaves.- Okay.
Want to ask her anything?
Tell your girl to ask
him something.
She is very innocent girl.
Send her to our house and
we'll teach her everything.
lt's alright sit.
Why have you come here?
Bride seeing ceremony is over there.
So...?
Grow up Pardhu.
l didn't mean growing taller.
l meant the mental growth.
Take it.
Considers herself a princess!
Consider you go to buy
an Ambassador Car.
There is a Benz car next to it.
Which one will you buy?
Consider you go to
buy a portable TV.
There is a big....- Plasma.
There is a plasma TV next to it.
Which one will you buy?
My sister is an Ambassador.
l'm the Benz car.
She is portable TV.
l'm a plasma TV.
She is a Lifebouy soap.
l'm a Lux soap.
My beauty shouldn't
hamper her chances.
That's why l came here.
Once she gets married,
l will get a Hritik Roshan
or a Abhishek Bachchan.
Even you're unable to
turn your eyes off me.
Oh god! Why did you make
me so beautiful?
Don't worry Poori.
Your parents are
worried unnecessarily.
You're not so beautiful.
Your eyes aren't so big.
Your nose is dented
as if punched by someone.
You're not so fair.
Then, why should they worry?
You mean, l'm not beautiful.
You think you look beautiful,
because they say so.
Everyone will say Benz is beautiful
but people buy only Ambassador.
Believe me.
Just go down happily.
Let me see who says
you're beautiful.
Pardhu, take a look again and say...
Someone broke it with a ball.
What happened?
What is it?
She says ldly is good but
the chutney is horrible.
l see.
She says chilly powder would do.
No...?
Keep quiet.
lt is not about ldlies or chutney.
Am l right?
ln the upstairs...
l'll tell them.
The power went off when she
was watching TV upstairs.
''When you can conduct
such big functions,
can't you afford to rent
a generator'', she says.
l ate.
Oh my god! - Headache?
What happened?
Ear pain?
What happened?
Neck pain.
No...?
What happened?
l'll tell you.
Pardhu said she is not beautiful.
ls Poori not beautiful?
Don't worry brother.
l'll handle the matter.
ls Poori not beautiful?
ls her mother beautiful?
ls her aunt beautiful?
Aren't we living with them?
And you...?
What does he say?
He wants to know our demands.
Ask him to apologize to her.
What's your problem?
Everyone says she is beautiful.
But you say she is not.
Who is wrong, you or her?
Us.- Shut up.
Apologize my boy.
We are not going to give up.
- Let me talk to him.
What will you talk?
- They are talking as they like.
Stop it....stop it.
Why are you shouting?
He is a brilliant boy,
even before marriage, he understood
that girls are not beautiful.
What l mean to say is,
this is not just Poori's problem.
lt is a problem to
the womanhood.
Neither boy Pardhu nor
a scholar like me can solve it.
So, l'm leaving it to god.
- What?
l'll count to 3.
When l say 3,
if it rains, it means
women are beautiful.
lf it does not rain...?
This is cheating.
- What?
We won't agree.
- Why?
The rain must come from the sky.
Counting 3 is very short.
Do you want me to
count to 3 million?
l'm very poor in maths.
l can't count more than that.
i Dream.
Gentle mischievous breeze
pinched the maiden's body...
Black clouds are thundering...
And chase with angry lightning...
The shores have melted...
Flowed in spate...
ln our village...
in our courtyards...
A thousand myriad hues...
The beautiful gentle rain...
Falling at the time
of happy moments...
Even the moon of the sky will
descend here to be part of it...
To reveal the secrets
behind the silence...
Calling you with affection...
With a bang in your heart...
lt's a rollicking foot tapping music...
Turning the bliss into
moments of wonder...
Won't it melt away the time?
ln the lap of the
magical moments...
Won't it make you forget years?
Festoon of stars will
light our home...
Shining bright like
a pearl chain...
Spreading the fragrance
of sandalwood...
Turning our courtyard into
a garden of flowers...
Tune of happiness in
the rhythm of smiles...
Speed of light in the flowers...
Where was it all these years?
This choral music...
Spread it's charm now only...
Happiness spread around
as fun and frolic...
New tunes of bliss are playing
here like fresh first rains...
The fun and frolic is
touching the sky...
lt's music of love and
affection all over here...
CBl Office...Hyderabad.
....Old man's room...
Why watch movies early
morning instead of studying?
Okay, l'll find out.
How many films...?
l'm trying to find out the answer.
How many films did Krishna act?
Krishnarjuna Yudham,
Krishna thulabaram,...
The question is not how many films
NTR played Lord Krishna's role.
How many films did
Super star Krishna act?
Around 300 films.
l want the exact figure.
Why?
What bothers you?
My grand daughter is
answering a TV quiz.
l'll find it from some
intelligent person.
Can't you know such simple things?
Why have you come here?
He said you called for me.
Siva Reddy murder case has
been entrusted to us.
Must be dealt very carefully.
Would 2 or 3 days be enough
for you to investigate?
l need 4 or 5 days to read this.
lf you need 4 or 5 days to read this,
how many days will you need
to understand what you read,
how many days will you need to
investigate what you understood,
and how many years will you need
to prepare the investigation report?
l'm not trying to confuse you.
l'll do it.
What is it dear?
Kamal Hasan's first wife's name?
l'm sending 2 men.
They'll tell you.
Your general knowledge is zero. Go.
Hello, it's me.
Find out which TV channel
my grand daughter is watching,
file a case against the
channel & close it down.
Silly questions? ldiot.
Hi Pardhu! How are you?
- lt has been very long since we met.
When did you arrive?
- l saw you when you were a kid.
You've grown very tall.
- l knew you will come.
l've informed all and he too
and brought him here.
l still know your tastes.
Fish curry. Mutton curry.
You finish it off.
Till then l'll wait outside.
No thanks.
You talk. l'll stand outside.
You told me about his arrival.
So, you talk.- No thanks.
lt was Giri who told me
about your arrival.
l'm not in a hurry.
Talk to him first. l'll go out.
Giri stop.
- He is a big nonsense.
You can't stop him
once he starts.
Atleast you tell him.
Wow! He remembers our names.
-You are right.
That's friendship.
You're fit for nothing.
Pardhu, you haven't changed.
- He grew little taller.
You finish.- No, you talk.
After you left the village,
l stopped eating dinner.
Didn't doctor advice you to skip
dinner to reduce your weight?
Just pour your feelings.
l'll stand outside.
Okay. l won't talk. Happy?
So, what's hot, Pardhu?
-You tell me.
Our villagers have got
settled in different places.
Good in studies have become teachers
and others started new schools.
lntelligent are doing
finance business.
Foolish are paying interest
to do agriculture.
Let's go out to have
a smoke and tea.
Just a minute. l'll inform my aunt.
Cigarettes for her? Not necessary.
l'll atleast inform her
about having coffee.
Okay then.
Sambar is tasteless.
Hey boy, change the glass.
He has mistaken water
for sambar.
lt's been very long since we came here.
Do you owe money
to this shopkeeper?
Have you ever felt sad about Shekar?
But l felt many times that
we committed a grave mistake.
Why dig the past?
What he did was wrong?
You could've advised him then.
l was only 10 then.
- He was also 10.
Whatever it is, what you did was wrong.
What did he do?
Waging life...at the age of 10.
ls it right?
Whose life? Who waged?
Who was 10 years old?
l'm not giving you any information.
l'm talking about my feeling.
Why do you feel?
Because it is an incident to feel.
What was the incident?
Why are you scratching old wounds?
Who scratched? What wound?
lt happened 12 years ago.
What happened?
lt's an unforgivable sin.
Hey...
Then, why did you talk about it then?
When l was busy eating
the burnt stuff,
who tortured me like a belly dancer
showing little and covering little?
Tell me what happened?
Tell me what is happening?
Tell me what will happen?
l want to know that now.
l must know.
l must know about it.
Tell him.
No.
He'll say his version
like a lawyer.
l'll say like a judge
acceptable to all.
Whatever it is,
tell it on my face.
in this village,
myself, Pardhu, Giri & priest's son
Shekar were studying 5th std.
One day Pardhu teased
Shekar as coward.
Shekar objected to it.
So, Pardhu challenged
him to a bet.
Visit cemetery at 12 midnight,
l will agree that you're
not a coward.
l will go. l'm not scared.
Okay. We'll keep 4 lemons
on Peer Sahib's grave in the afternoon.
You must bring them
back at night.
Okay sure.
We insisted not to go.
But Pardhu went to Shekar's
house & woke him up.
Shekar alone went to
the cemetery in the night.
He took 3 out of 4 lemons
which we had kept there.
While taking the 4th one,
he felt like someone
pulling him from behind.
He thought it was a ghost.
And his heart stopped beating.
Next morning we saw
it was branch of a tree.
Fear is worse than ghost.
Where is Pardhu?
Sharma hasn't come
out of the shock yet.
You know Shailaja, right?
Shekar's sister.
She was taken to hospital
recently finding difficult to breath.
Doctors said she has
a hole in the heart.
Operation would cost 2 lakhs.
Sharma trusts his god
for everything.
How will god help him
when he's dependent on priest?
Would you like to eat? No.
People come to this
temple to offer prayers,
but never offer anything to god.
Worst fellows.
Shall we go to his house once?
Excuse me sir...
Who is that?
We were on the way to Rajamundry
We had a flat tyre.
Oh no! There is no shop around.
lt's alright.
We will go pushing the car.
Could you please give some water?
- Just a minute.
Also bring something to eat.
We came here to help & not to eat.
Then, tell them that you're Pardhu.
Why lie to them?
l want to help them rather
than telling them the truth.
Help? lt is no child's play?
lt is a heart surgery.- l know.
Do trees in your house bear
money instead of fruits?
ls it not enough if trees in
this house bears money?
What is that?- Money.
Money? How much?
lsn't that enough?
Have you got it like that?
You threw 3 lakhs
for a hibiscus plant.
Had it been a banana tree,
would you've thrown 5 lakhs?
There is nothing inside.
Just some sweetmeat
offered to the god.
Do you've to feel so bad to say that?
l like it very much.
lt would be handy on
our way back.
lt's alright take it.
Okay.
Let's go.- Just a minute.
lf you don't mistake me,
let me tell you something.
Please.
Ask Aunty to offer prayers
everyday to the Holy Basil plant.
She offers prayers everyday.
Not just prayers, tell her to
offer Hibiscus flowers too.
lt'll give boons...- Come.
Okay.- Tell her to
clean the place too.
There's lot of....dust...
Don't forget to clean it.
Where is he?
Do you know Lord Rama & Hanuman
visited priest's home last night?
Surprised? lt's you the Rama sans
Seetha and l the Hanuman sans tail.
l know that we can gamble & drink
for 6 months if we've Rs.3 lakhs.
Now l know we can take Lord Rama
to priest Sharma's home.
Why are you silent?
God shouldn't be dull.
l'm not a god.
l'm not even an ordinary
human like you.
Thank god didn't say
you weren't Pardhu.
Yes...l'm not Pardhu.
What?
lf you weren't Pardhu,
why did you give money to Sharma?
Because Pardhu was
responsible for their misery.
lf you weren't Murthy's grandson,
why did you come to this village?
l was responsible
for Pardhu's death.
Little confusing but
l've understood it.
One last question.
lf you didn't kill Siva Reddy,
why don't you find who killed him?
Who should l ask?
Siva Reddy is dead,
so you've to ask Baji Reddy.
He's no kid to tell me
on asking him.
You can't leave it,

Police are combing for me.
Oh! Then it's good for you
to be underground.

You revealed your secrets to me.
What if l tell it to everyone here?
l didn't tell you on asking me,
l told you because l trust you.

Pull the trigger and gone.
