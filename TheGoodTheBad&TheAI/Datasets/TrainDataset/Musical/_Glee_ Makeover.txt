So here's what you missed on Glee:
Kurt's in New York
where he's rooming with Rachel
and planning to interview
for Vogue.com. Rachel's friend,
Brody, totally wants
to date her, but she's still
confused about Finn,
and Finn's still in the army,
and nobody's heard from him.
- Glee!
- Back at McKinley,
Mr. Schue's trying to repeat
a win at nationals
by repeating assignments from last year.
- Are we doing Britney week again?
- That's great.
And Sam's new blonde
besties with Brittany,
who didn't graduate and thinks
she's still president even
though all she accomplished last year
was a dinosaur prom.
That's what you missed on Glee.
BLAINE:
All right, Blaine Anderson,
time to change things up.
Last year, it was all
about letting the seniors shine.
But this year...
it's your turn.
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
There's a room
where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls
come tumbling down
When they do,
I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants
to rule the world...
Of course, part of the reason
I'm doing all these extracurriculars
is to fill my days
now that Kurt's in New York.
We talk and Skype and text
as much as possible,
but the only time we're really in sync
is when we're hate-watching
Treme together.
These songs go on forever,
and why isn't there more zydeco?
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants
to rule the...
Say that you'll never,
never, never, never need it
One headline,
why believe it?
Everybody wants
to rule the world.
What do you think you're doing,
Blaine Warbler?
I'm running for president.
KURT: I've spent the entire
weekend trying to choose
the absolute perfect outfit because
I've snagged an interview at...
drum roll, please...
Hi, I'm Kurt Hummel.
Vogue.com.
Yes, it's just for an internship,
but I haven't been this nervous
since I auditioned for NYADA,
and we all know how that turned out.
I'm meeting with the new senior editor
and designer extraordinaire.
Isabelle Wright,
and her stellar reputation precedes her.
She's a style maverick.
She double-majored
in fashion design
and dead romance languages.
- An iconoclast.
- Rumor has it,
She gave Steve Jobs
his first black turtleneck.
She's Vogue's rogue.
Miss Wright will see you now.
Hello?
Columbus.
- Excuse me?
- You're from Lima.
I'm from Columbus.
And actually, I once got
food poisoning in Lima
at some Italian place,
It was Bread...
- Stix?
- Breadstix, yes.
I can't believe you ate at Breadstix.
Well, I wish I hadn't.
Isabelle Wright.
Kurt Hummel.
So, Mr. Hummel,
I have to tell you,
I am very impressed
with your online resume,
especially this gallery of you
and your rather bold
clothing choices.
- Where did you find all this?
- Well, I.. I made most of them,
And searched the
Internet for bargains.
And, uh, that half-sweater there
at the bottom, that belonged
to my dead aunt, and I
found it in her attic.
And the embroidered calico vest
was actually inspired
by one of your designs.
Oh, yes,
my quilted micro skirt collection.
It was an epic fail.
But like you said in Vanity Fair,
"I don't trust anyone who hasn't
failed big at least once."
Have a seat.
So, I'm just gonna ask you
a couple of routine questions
I ask all potential hires.
Who are your fashion icons?
Audrey Hepburn,
Michelle Obama,
and not to kiss up or anything,
but... you.
And have you done
any writing on fashion?
Self journaling, mostly.
I did weekly updates
and, um, blogs on Project Runway
since season one,
- and...
- Wave your magic wand,
Where would you be in four years?
Working here part-time,
graduating from NYADA
and, uh,
starting my first Broadway show.
I know that sounds presumptuous.
No.
Frankly, you should be
more presumptuous, you know?
This is New York;
It's for dreamers.
It's for people like you,
who are just starting out,
and people like me who...
very much want
to re-invent themselves.
No, you should dream.
You should dream very, very big.
And then you should work
incredibly hard
and make sure you do everything
in your power to make it happen.
Look, Anna hired me because she said
that the Web sites that I designed
for my collections were inspired.
So neither myself nor my team
can let her down,
and that includes you.
- Me?
- Well, listen,
My friend, anybody who can
pull off a hippo brooch
deserves to be here.
So welcome to Vogue.com.
Thank you. Thank you so...
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
That should come with a warning.
Oh, it did.
Artie, can I talk
to you for a second?
Okay, so I'm running for senior class
president again, and I
want you to be my VP.
Being vice presidential pick
of McKinley High's
first two-term president
would look really good
on your college resume.
I have a 4.0 GPA,
and I scored a 210
on my practice SAT,
and I was the only
handi-capable member
of a national championship glee club.
I'm not really worried
about getting into college.
I know how people like you are
afraid of the spotlight sometimes,
but did you know that Franklin
Roosevelt was part robot, too,
- and he's on Mount Rushmore?
- No, he isn't.
And I'm just going to say it again,
- I'm not part robot.
- I realize
That I didn't do much
as president last year,
and if you help me
win again this year,
I promise to do exactly
the same thing, which means
I'll be president, and you can
make all the boring decisions.
So I could be Cheney to your Bush.
I'd rather be landing strip.
I mean, it's no secret that a woman
loves a man in power,
and don't take this personally,
but before I graduate,
I would like to have
a relationship that lasts longer
than a couple weeks.
Why would I take that personally?
- You and I dated.
- We did?
Look, you've got yourself a deal.
-
- Cool.
Okay, as you all know,
as national champions
we get to host the annual Show
Choir Rules Committee meeting.
Please tell me you're gonna ask
what 1/3 vintage meant last year?
Or like, why some teams get
to sing six songs
and other ones only do one?
JAKE:
Speaking of competitions,
shouldn't we start like,
preparing for ours?
WILL:
I have some ideas
which I am working on very hard.
Um...
I don't really want
to give anything away right now...
I have no ideas. I'm tapped out.
I spent all last weekend
trying to think of something
for us to perform,
and all I came up with
was a scat version of "Carmina Burana."
- Yes, go ahead.
- Excuse me, I'm not sure if what
You were saying was actually
important 'cause I wasn't listening
but I'd like to make an announcement.
First, I'd like to know
if anyone can prove that Blaine
was actually born in this country.
Second, I'm wrapping up the election
by selecting Artie
as my running mate.
Ah! All right.
I think by bridging
the human-slash-robot
divide, we'll ensure
that both students and vending
machines will be voting for us.
- Still not a robot.
- BLAINE: Brittany, that's not fair.
This isn't a popularity contest,
it's about who's got the best ideas.
It's about believing
you can make a change, right?
ARTIE:
What is that taste
in my...?
Is that sour grape?
-
- Brittany.
- Hey, butt-chin.
- Hey, Sue.
I'm making a list of potential themes
for our set list at sectionals,
and right now I can't decide
between classic TV theme songs
or a salute to autumn.
William, those are terrible.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
What happened to all my good ideas?
Oh, don't kid yourself; you
never had any good ideas.
You just didn't notice
because you were too busy
chasing your bizarre childhood dream
of a glee club national championship.
And now that that's over,
well, you're waking up
to the incessant
mind-numbing tedium
that is the day-to-day life
of a schoolteacher.
Take a look around you, William,
at this sad panoply
of walking human garbage.
This is what you have
to look forward to.
In a few short years,
you'll either be an alcoholic...
morbidly obese...
or both.
That's what I like to call
the Full Charlotte Rae.
Personally, William,
I think you should take
this opportunity to
bow out gracefully
and explore other job opportunities.
Now, your penchant for
bland, simplistic aphorisms
could give you a leg up
in the motivational hot-air
balloon poster business,
and of course,
your complete lack of adult friends
means you're well on
your way to a career
as a pedophile birthday clown.
But I love my job.
William, you had a dream,
and you achieved it.
Now move on.
Otherwise, you'll end up like that.
Quietly smirking because you just did
a little crop-dusting.
Oh, and now you're enjoying the
sneaky tickle of your own stink
as it ripples up your
enormous, soupy butt crack.
Hey, why didn't you ask me
to be your running mate?
I'm like the perfect candidate.
Well, I didn't want it
to ruin our friendship.
I mean, look at Sarah Palin.
She and her grandfather,
they were super close,
and then he asked her
to be his running mate,
and they lost, and now
they're not even speaking.
But I do think you'd be
a great vice president,
so I'm going to help you out.
Come here.
Blaine Warbler?
I'd like to introduce you
to Sam Evans.
Um, we've actually met several times.
He's your candidate
for vice president.
Uh, no. I'm picking
my own running mate.
My family's on food stamps,
so that will
get you the sympathy vote.
I'm not gay,
so that'll help
with the not-gay vote,
and you know,
I don't want to brag, but...
:
My impressions are hilarious
It's George Bush, come on.
Okay, sure.
Awesome.
First order of business,
Artie and I challenge you
and Sam to a debate.
You're on.
:
What's a debate?
I think it's time
we tackled something
that we have been avoiding
for far too long,
and I think you all know
exactly
what I'm talking about.
Leather...
Leather, but in unexpected ways.
Pitch me.
Okay, it's coming to me.
It's coming to me. It's Italy.
Sal√≥, 1944.
Belts as punishment.
Belts as reward.
"You can't have a belt!
You: put a belt on!"
It's faux-fascist.
It's... pair it with a chunky
boot.
Okay, belts were two years ago,
and chunky boots were five years ago.
While we're on the topic
of the verboten,
I would beg all of you
to please, please
not offer up a leather platform.
Chase, you know I love you,
and I... and I love
that you're filled
with so much passion,
so I'm definite...
I'm going to...
I'll keep thinking
about it, of course.
Okay.
Um... Daphne.
Leather socks.
Suede underpants.
Cowhide brassieres.
Daphne, did you go
off your meds again?
Yes.
Then I want you to stay off
because that... is sick.
I mean good sick.
That's the...
that's the kind of sick
I want you to be.
You know, that's exactly what
I'm talking about, everybody.
I don't want any rules...
just toss them.
You know, let's think out of the box.
Or... maybe... I don't know.
Maybe that's... maybe that's
too far out of the box.
Okay, why don't we do this?
Let's, uh... we'll...
we're going to take a...
a little break,
and then we will...
we'll revisit the topic
of leather, okay?
Kurt, can I... can I see you
in my office?
So, what did you think
of the ideas in there?
Fascinating.
I hated them.
Look, I-I know I'm
just an intern,
but I feel like "unexpected leather"
should be in the back pages
of The Village Voice.
No, I know, I agree, but Mand...
Mandy, you know, the receptionist,
every time I walk
by her, she suggests
that I do an article on
trends in animal hide.
And then her cat died.
Did you know her cat died?
So, what, am I going to say no?
- So now I'm stuck with leather.
- No, you're not.
There are a million different ideas.
Uh, we could do a music
video that pays tribute
to the most cutting-edge
fashion, right?
Well, I told Chase Madison
that I would do his piece
on Spanx for cankles:
"Spankles."
Oh, God. I'm an artist,
not a manager.
I... I can't say no to anybody.
I can't bear it.
You know, I'm...
I'm used to knocking on doors,
not bolting them shut.
Back in the day, if I had
an idea... a crazy idea...
I knew if it was good
based on my instinct.
And now crazy ideas
just seem crazy to me.
You know, like, uh, uh...
uh, high-heeled galoshes or, um,
equestrian underwear... what?
And I can't...
I can't land anything.
I just feel like I lucked
into a job
that I don't deserve, and I...
honestly, I-I-I...
I have no idea
what I'm doing.
My collection was a failure.
I can't fail at this.
And I just rented
a one-bedroom apartment
in Midtown so I could walk to work.
But now I'm not going to have
a job to walk to
or an apartment to walk from.
I'm going to be homeless.
Hey, hey.
You are not going to be homeless.
All right? You can
always come stay
with me and my roommate in Bushwick.
Oh, God.
Brittany, I just got a copy
of Jacob Ben Israel's
latest presidential poll.
The good news is 90%
of respondents said
they're planning
on attending Friday's debate.
That's cool.
So what's the bad news?
they were coming to hear you...
say something
st... stu...
They think I'm going to say
something stupid.
But, see, you're not stupid.
You're really creative.
Your brain exists in this
magical other dimension
where anything is possible.
It's really amazing.
We just need to focus on
a little preparation.
If I'm going to be completely honest,
I'm a little worried
that my picking you
as a running mate is going to
seem like a desperate grab
for the straight vote
if you don't really look
like a serious candidate, you know?
:
What do you mean, pilgrim?
- Was that John Wayne?
- Yeah. I panicked.
Okay, listen.
When's your next free period?
I need you to meet me
in the costume shop.
Brittany S. Pierce,
how do you react
to the characterization of
your first term in office
as one in which you didn't do
anything at all until prom?
I would describe that
as entirely accurate.
Okay.
Test scores at McKinley
have gone down
six percent every year
for the past decade.
- What would you do to fix the problem?
- Stop giving tests.
They're hard, and there's
way too many of them.
What is your favorite color?
Filipino.
They're very hard workers,
and family is very important to them.
You know what?
Let's talk wardrobe.
Oh, make me over
I'm all I wanna be
A walking study
In demonology
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad
you could make it now
Oh look at my face
My name is might have been
My name is never was
My name's forgotten
Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey
There's only us left now
When I wake up in my makeup
Have you ever felt
so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless
Hooker, waitress
Model, actress,
oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated
everything she kissed
Now she's fading
Somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here
with your pound of flesh
You want a part of me
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap.
Okay.
First off, I'd just like to say
what an honor it is
to have been asked to lead
the annual
Show Choir Committee meeting.
- Which of these snacks are gluten free?
- I guess the carrots are.
Did it state so on the package?
Because you do not want
to deal with me
- if I've got gluten in my system.
- We really need
- to get started, Mr. Rumba.
- What?
- We really need to get started.
- Well, why didn't you say so?
I did... several times.
Well, I didn't hear you.
You know I have complete
loss of hearing
- in my left ear... scarlet fever.
- Uh, Birdie,
You had mentioned you
wanted to discuss
some of the redistricting bylaws.
I've been doing some research,
and it turns out...
- in Article 12...
WILL: I'm so bored.
What is wrong with me?
This is what I've always wanted.
I won Nationals.
I'm... I'm in charge of this committee.
But it feels so meaningless.
Do all teachers feel this at some point?
When Regionals occur
in a leap year...
Oh, this is pointless!
I didn't know how
to tell you guys...
- but my glee club lost its funding.
- Oh, my God.
We're done. We can't even
complete the season.
I know that everybody likes
to make fun of the deaf choir,
but my kids have a song
in their heart; they're not
going to be able to sing it.
For some of them,
it's the only thing that brings
them any happiness.
It's the only thing that brings me
any happiness
besides my extreme couponing
and muscle relaxers.
I'm so sorry.
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.
You can watch your back,
because you're next.
We're all dead.
The money for the arts has dried up.
What we need is representation
on that blue-ribbon
government panel to get arts
back in the schools.
There was a huge debate
over that in Congress.
Oh, they don't care about us.
They don't want
to have anything to do
with show choir directors;
They want bigwigs
like Meryl Streep or Demi Lovato.
Maybe they'll take
a show choir director
who just won Nationals
and wants to make
a difference in this world.
- Go for it.
- RUMBA: Highly unlikely.
I'm going to have a shame Triscuit.
I don't care if I have to spend
all night on the potty.
RACHEL:
Yeah, I swear it.
It was like a deleted
scene from The Exorcist
that was cut because it
was actually too scary.
- Oh, chilling.
- And then I tried...
I tried to be, like,
nice and, you know, smile,
but then the black swans said to me...
I didn't know Lena Dunham
was joining us today.
I'm sorry, but did I do
something to offend you?
Your outfit did.
It's at least a decade away from even
being considered
for ironic-retro.
It's a tragedy What Not to Wear
doesn't do
two-hour specials.
You know, part of why
I was so excited
to come to New York was because
I thought it would be a chance
for me to start over,
reinvent myself.
I had no idea that it was going to be
so exactly the same.
You know why you
feel exactly the same?
Hmm?
Because you're still
dressing exactly the same.
We're not in Ohio any more, Rachel.
And even then,
it's not like we were on trend.
I hate to say this, but
life is like high school.
Styles and clothes determine
the pecking order.
Well, I don't know
what you expect me to do.
It's not like I can afford
an entire new wardrobe.
Who says you'll have to pay for it?
Put down your chopsticks
and follow me.
I got an idea.
It's almost midnight.
What are you talking about?
I'm about to change your life.
And maybe mine, too.
Oh, my God, this is crazy.
- Take a picture of me.
- Come on, quick, quick, quick.
Check this out.
This is unbelievable.
Wait, I'm scared.
Don't leave me.
RACHEL:
Oh, my God.
I can't even breathe.
They call this the Couture Vault.
It supposedly
can withstand a nuclear blast.
Okay, I'll set up the camera.
ISABELLE:
Freeze!
Kurt.
Oh, uh... I thought
you were going to be
At dinner with Steve Buscemi
and Yoko Ono.
Well, they canceled again.
What are you doing here?
And who is that?
I'm Rachel Berry...
I'm Kurt's roommate. He...
We were going to do
a music video for the Web site.
- He adores you.
- Rachel was going to get a makeover,
And she was going to model
some clothes.
Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.
You had me at "makeover."
Someday
When I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
But you're never fully dressed
without a smile
Oh, it's lovely
With your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me
But to love you
But you're never fully dressed
without a smile
Who cares what they're wearing
From Main Street
to Saville Row?
It's what you wear
from ear to ear
And not from head to toe
Lover
Never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Remember,
you're never fully dressed
Without a smile
Ba da-da, ba da-da
Ba da-da,
ba da-da
Ba da-da-da
Bum-bum-bye
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile
Lover...
Never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you
But you're never fully dressed
Without a...
Smile
Smile...
Smile
Just the...
Way you look tonight.
- KURT: And that was just the rough cut.
- No, it's genius.
And Rachel looks so gorgeous,
the whole looks so...
like, professional,
like a real fashion video that
you'd seen on TV or something.
So what's the next step?
KURT:
Well, uh, ideally
the dream would be that
Isabelle would see it,
and love it, and then
put it on Vogue.com.
But I mean, she's already committed
to so many other concepts that...
No, Kurt, of course she's going to
choose yours. She's gonna pick yours.
KURT: And then, after
we made over Rachel,
Isabelle took us to this place
called Gray's Papaya
and we had guava juice and hot dogs.
- BLAINE: Wow.
- It was amazing.
You're hanging out with fashion
goddess Isabelle Wright.
And I'm running for
Student Body President
with a former stripper.
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that!
How's it going?
It's going okay.
But, um, I did want to
ask you what bow tie
you thought I should wear
for tomorrow's debate.
I have narrowed it down to five,
but mainly I have...
Bow ties are your signature,
whatever you choose is
gonna look great on you.
- RACHEL: Hi, Blaine, we miss you!
- Oh, Rachel says hi.
Oh, hi, Rachel.
By the way, one more question
about the video.
That scene where she plays
the East Village It Girl...
did you think that was too much?
No, it's... I don't know.
Oh, good, good, good. 'Cause I
didn't either, but she was
a little skeptical.
But I said she was very
Chloe Sevigny chic, right?
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah.
And then, oh my God, I found
this sweater in the vault
that was to die for!
-
- Hi.
Hi.
I know I don't have an
appointment, but, uh...
I really needed to speak to
my guidance counselor,
and not my fianc√©e.
Well, please have
a seat, Mr. Schuester.
Mr. Schuester.
As you know,
all I've ever wanted
was to make a difference.
Change people's lives.
Make them better.
I'd like to think that
I've done that in my time here.
- Mm-hmm.
- Winning Nationals,
Seeing most of the kids graduate.
Right, you have a lot
to be proud of here.
But now I have this once in a
lifetime opportunity in front of me.
A chance to make a difference
on a whole new level.
Okay.
So they're... they're assembling
a blue-ribbon panel
to improve arts education
around the country.
I filled out the application,
but I haven't sent it in yet.
This looks amazing.
If I were to get this...
I would have to leave
McKinley for several months.
Paid for by the District,
but I'd be away from the kids.
Oh. Um... Okay.
I... You know we've been telling
these kids for years
to follow their dreams
no matter what, so...
Yeah.
I'm not going to tell you
to do the opposite.
I just don't want to do
anything to jeopardize...
this-this new life
we're about to begin together.
It's not gonna change a thing.
Okay? Weddings can wait.
You have to apply for this position.
And if you get it,
we will cross that bridge
when we come to it.
Together.
Attention, miniscule segment
of the student body.
Principal Figgins is out this week,
with what he describes as
religious fever.
SUE : And I am forced
to moderate these proceedings.
Hey, dude, uh,
now that you made me over,
- can I give you some advice?
- Yeah, sure.
- Lose the bow tie.
- What?
Yeah, trust me,
it makes you look uptight
and a little like a young
Orville Redenbacher.
Just... take it off.
Okay.
You know what?
Actually, it's...
you're actually right.
Thank you.
SUE: There are two new
utterly disheartening
wrinkles to this year's
absolutely pointless contest.
First, the horrifying fact that
this year's slate of candidates
consists entirely
of Glee Club members.
And secondly,
the inexplicable introduction
of a vice presidential field
for no discernable reason whatsoever.
Separation of powers!
Whoo!
So let's meet these
second-tiered losers.
You know them as
the pimp and the gimp.
Artie Abrams and Sam Evans.
SUE: Stumbles, my first
question is for you.
Who, in God's name,
gives a hot, wet, steamy dump
about student government?
-
- I do.
And I think everyone
in this room should, too.
First of all, student government
isn't just a way for us to pad
our college r√©sum√©s.
It's a way for us
to take an active role
in our own education.
Study after study shows
that an active student body
is a successful student body.
Okay, moving on.
Student government
is just the beginning.
We need more
after-school programs,
and better-qualified staff
to support
our teachers, who are
overworked and underpaid.
- Oh, dear God.
- And that's just the beginning.
I want to talk about the
cafeteria, 'cause I believe...
at the beginning of every
year to see if...
enough to support
our brain activity...
That's one of the many goals
I promise to reach
by the midway point of my first term,
as outlined in my 96-point
Pierce-Abrams Road map
To Restore McKinley's Future.
Merciful sweet Jesus, thank you.
Sam Evans, your response?
I wasn't really listening.
Whatever Artie said,
I agree with that.
SUE: Our next question
is from the Twitter.
@HungrySouthMouth asks Sam Evans,
"Rumor has it you were a
stripper. Aren't you ashamed?"
No, I'm not.
In fact...
- GIRL: Whoo...
-  Shake that
Students at this school
have every right to be angry.
Last year's student council,
led by my opponent,
was the most ineffectual
in a generation.
Brittany S. Pierce,
in her last term,
accomplished absolutely nothing,
except plan
a dinosaur-themed prom
and ban the use
- of hair gel.
-
Ladies and gentlemen,
telling anyone what
they can or cannot
put into their hair is disgusting.
It's the first step
towards tyranny, my friends.
Next thing you know,
they'll start burning books.
And then they'll probably
start burning people, too.
That's a lie.
This tyranny all
ends today, McKinley.
I want to offer you a change.
And I am that change.
Let's make history, Titans.
And vote Anderson-Evans.
Thank you.
Sweet, simple Brittany.
What say you?
Uh...
I love you.
I love you so much,
McKinley High School.
Simple as that.
In fact...
I think that everyone
should love this school
as much as I do.
If you elect me as president,
I promise to outlaw summer vacation,
so we'll have school all year round.
That means we'll spend every day
of every summer indoors
with all our friends,
in McKinley High School's
award-winning air conditioning.
Also, I promise to end
McKinley High School's
policy of having weekends.
If you make me your president,
Saturday and Sunday will be illegal,
so that Monday will
come right after Friday,
which is the funnest day anyways.
Vote Brittany and Artie.
Thank you so much.
-
- We just lost the election.
Kurt, can I see you for a minute?
You might want to sit down for this.
I saw your video,
and I forwarded it to Anna.
Am I fired?
ISABELLE:
That is the first time
that I've heard "great" from Anna.
I am gonna print that and frame it.
Does... does this mean
they're gonna put the
video on the Web site?
Sort of.
We're gonna reshoot the whole thing
in Bali with Karol√≠na Kurkov√°,
but you're getting credit
- for the idea.
- Oh, my...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you.
And thank you so much for
helping out with Rachel.
She went home that night
and threw away her reindeer sweater,
which is a huge deal for her.
Ah, she already seems so much
more confident, you know?
It's so funny how
a new image can change everything.
Oh...
I sure hope you never lose that.
What?
Oh, just your...
unbridled, wide-eyed,
Lima, Ohio optimism.
You know, I had an instinct
about you, Kurt Hummel,
and so far,
it's proven to be correct.
I feel like we're real
kindred spirits, don't you?
I agree.
Can I please just say that
I think you're the best-dressed
fairy godmother
an intern like me could ever have?
Well, then, can your fairy godmother
give you a little bit of advice?
You have quite the
aptitude for fashion.
And I know it's your
dream to go to NYADA,
but sometimes dreams can change,
and I really would not
be surprised if someday,
every A-lister in this town
was fighting for one of your designs.
So which "leather" pitch
are we running with?
Oh, actually, you know what?
We're gonna toss the whole thing
and start from scratch.
We're gonna meet here in two hours.
Oh, and, um...
Kurt will be joining us.
I'm famished.
Let's go to Indochine.
Wow.
Hm.
You look incredible.
They say that you haven't
settled into New York City
until you've had your first makeover.
Mine took six months.
Oh, really?
Like you need a makeover?
Every girl in school
wants to date you.
- True.
-
But four years ago,
I was a scrawny kid
from backwater Montana,
with a bad haircut and a unibrow.
And seniors took me under their wing,
introduced me to waxes and the gym,
- and they changed my life.
- Yeah.
It's pretty amazing what
a good makeover can do.
It's like you change the outside,
and then the inside
just... follows.
I think it's the other way around.
I think now your outside
has caught up to how
you feel about yourself.
Hmm.
I like that.
I like you.
So what are you working on?
Just a new number.
I like to do something every day,
just to keep
my machine well-oiled.
Oh, me too.
I love that song.
Do you, uh...
want to sing it with me?

I-I think a change

BOTH:

That was amazing.
You're amazing.
What are you doing tomorrow tonight?
I want to cook you dinner.
Attention, students:
Your record-low election votes
have been tallied,
and we have a winner.
Becky, can I get
a xylophone flourish?
No? Not feeling it?
Okay.
This year's Student Council
President is...
How do you do?
How you doing?
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Artie.
Losing the bow tie, that was
your game changer... kudos.
No hard feelings.
Maybe I can find a place
for you in my administration.
No, thanks;
I got what I needed.
Sugar asked me out on a date.
She invited me horseback riding.
I'm just hoping it doesn't
involve being towed.
- You talk to Kurt?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
He was super proud of me
and he's really excited.
He's already planning
a whole inaugural ball.
Well, congratulations.
Thanks.
You know,
I have not stepped foot inside
a Manhattan movie theater
since the bedbug scare.
-
- And this is a fact:
They prefer to lay
their eggs in couture.
That's true.
Who wouldn't?
I'm not lying.
RACHEL: What's the
last movie you saw?
The last...
Ooh, you know what?
The last movie I saw was
a double feature.
It was, um, Unmarried Woman
and The Red Balloon.
You weren't bored.
No, no, I wasn't even...
That's okay.
There's the man of the hour.
You all right?
You know, it didn't hit me
until right now:
I came to McKinley
for Kurt... that's it.
And now he's gone, and even
with Glee Club, it just...
I feel really,
really... alone.
You're kind of killing
my party buzz, bro.
I'm sorry, it's just that
I did all of this for him,
I did all of this for him.
And now he's not here.
And so it just kind of feels
like none of it matters.
Of course it matters.
You're McKinley's
"First Gay Guy President."
Nobody cares about that.
Look, before you, Kurt was
the first gay kid I met.
Don't get me wrong, he's great,
but I just don't really
get his Bravo jokes
or the fashion thing or Broadway.
You and me, it's different, you know?
I never had a gaybro before.
We'd be like
Wolverine and Cyclops, you know,
show people how we're
cool with each other.
And you know, if you ask me,
that's what matters.
Thanks, man.
You're right.
But just so we're clear...
BOTH:
I'm Wolverine.
I'm...
I said it first.
Congratulations, Blaine Warbler.
Thank you, Brit.
Cool.
Congratulations to you,
Mr. Vice President.
The people have spoken.
Can I let you in on a little secret?
I like secrets.
I voted for you.
What?
Thank you.
I would've voted for you, too,
but I-I just
really wanted to win.
I know losing sucks, but you know,
sometimes it can be a good thing.
Look at Al Gore.
He lost an election,
then he won an Oscar.
He did?
You think so?
I don't know how you do it.
What?
You just always know exactly
the right thing to say.
It's a gift.
You win.
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,
but I'm taking Sue
Sylvester's advice.
I mailed in the application.
Congratulations, William.
I think it's the right decision.
Yeah.
There's only one problem.
I need a written recommendation
from a colleague,
and I was thinking...
I'm one step ahead
of you, butt-chin.
I took the liberty of
composing a letter
to the Arts Governing Board outlining
your astonishing accomplishments.
"Not only is William a direct
descendant of Harriet Tubman,
he delivered my infant child
with his bare hands"?
Sue, Sue, this isn't even true.
Well, what can I say, William?
I want you out of here.
And for the first time, I think
I mean that in a good way.
Oh, my God...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh...
Wow.
You're smokin'.
Oh, it's actually the duck.
No, no.
It's, it's you.
Come in.
RACHEL:
I really wanted to cook you dinner,
but this is what you get.
- This is, this is good.
- Pizza.
Food is food. It's, it's
the effort that counts.
A girl has never cooked
me dinner before.
I don't believe you.
- No.
-
No one has ever even tried.
I'm trying new things.
Doing new things, it's all part of
you know, the new me.
And I like it.
I like, I like the new me.
I've never been the
cook-a-guy-dinner type.
I've always been the just
annoy-a-guy-for-a-year
until-he-finally-
gives-in type.
Well, tell, tell me
about this old Rachel.
- Tell me a secret.
- A secret?
Something that you don't want
anyone else to know.
Okay, but you first.
- Okay.
- Think of something very good.
- Okay, so, um, when I was a kid...
- Mm-hmm.
- I was obsessed with Ace of Base.
- No.
- Yes.
-
I was... seriously, I had
the posters on my wall.
Wait. I thought you said
you were straight.
- Oh, come on.
-
Hot girls playing all
their own instruments...
is straighter than straight.
Moon river,
wider than a mile...
Thank you.
You're welcome...
Your turn.
My turn, okay.
Um, I have a good one.
When I was eight years old,
I got my first love letter
- from a guy named Tony.
-
And he was very cute.
And when he gave it to me,
I corrected all
of the grammatical errors
and his spelling errors
and gave it back to him.
That's so embarrassing.
I've never told anybody that before,
not even Finn.
Well, just so you know,
no matter how lovely this is,
I'm hands-off.
Just friends.
We're after
The same
Rainbow's end
Waitin' round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river...
And me.
-
-
It's Kurt.
He keeps forgetting his keys.
