On behalf of your commanding officer,
I'm sure I can tell Mr. José lturbi...
...that the officers and crew
of this ship are grateful to him...
...for coming here to lead
our Navy bands in this ceremony.
Along with every other civilian,
it is I who am grateful to you...
...and to all the men
in the United States Navy.
The men who are to be decorated
are present, sir.
Joseph Brady,
Gunner's Mate Second Class.
Clarence Doolittle, Seaman First Class.
During the action aboard
the USS cruiser
...these two men
remained at their stations...
...serving their gun
until the ammunition was exhausted.
When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard...
...Joseph Brady, without regard
for his own personal safety...
...dived into the sea
and rescued his shipmate.
Acting for the secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.
To the men who formally
served on the
...including those
I've just decorated...
...you'll be granted four days' leave,
effective immediately.
Leave your quarter.
Let me through, boys.
Yeah, I'm hopeful.
The poor little fellas.
They gotta stay and mind the ship
for the admiral.
- That's right.
- That's it, rub it in.
They don't get to go to Hollywood...
...where the beautiful dames
grow like oranges.
Where all you gotta do is reach out
and pick them right off the street.
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.
You'll probably visit the studios...
...if you see those stars,
will you get me some autographs?
Oh, no, not this baby.
After eight months at sea...
...it ain't a bunch of autographs
I'm gonna wind up with. Here.
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans, Joe?
Well, in Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named Lola.
Oh, that Lola.
I tell you, she's a...
Well, it isn't exactly that,
but it's a...
- No, it isn't that either.
- Tell us about her, Joe.
- Yeah.
- Well...
...notice how different the band
sounded with that guy lturbi leading?
- That was good.
- Lola's kind of like that.
Put her with the most beautiful dames
in the world...
...she's the one you'd see,
that's all.
You mean she's different, huh, Joe?
I wouldn't say that.
If you like dames, what's the point of
getting one different from other dames?
No, I guess it's just that whatever
the others have, Lola has more of it.
Does she got a sister?
Hey, what makes you think
this Lola is still waiting?
Dames have been known to wander.
From me? Please, sailor,
leave us not talk mutiny.
Oh, do you think
we can tear ourselves away?
Yeah, but it'll be tough.
- We hate to leave.
- We hate to leave.
You know, Clarence,
I think it's awful, us going ashore...
...leaving these guys here
in their undershirts...
...and we gotta go meet
beautiful dames...
...in their soft silk dresses.
Yeah, but duty is duty,
and an order is an order.
You know, I know some guys
that get a thrill...
...out of meeting a gorgeous gal
every night.
But, honey, I saved every minute
of my leave for you.
Oh, why shouldn't I have?
Oh, you're the only one any place
I wanna see.
What's he doing wrong, Joe?
He's dead, that's all. Watch.
But ho...
But, honey, I don't wanna meet
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
I wanna meet you.
Well, you'll be sorry.
You'll be sorry.
Hello, Ms. Laverne?
Ms. Lola Laverne?
Is this the face that launched
a thousand ships?
Yeah. Yeah, it's Joe, all right.
Don't anybody even want
a cup of coffee?
No business.
Well, it'll be a couple hours
before I hit Hollywood.
Can you wait?
Oh, I know what you mean, baby.
But you just try.
Let's decide that later,
after eight months at sea...
...all I wanna do is just look at you
for a long, long time.
Oh, you'll like. For sure.
- Come on, get a move on.
- Come on.
Come on, eight months
is a long enough time to wait.
Hello?
Hello, you beautiful creature.
When you hear the tone, the time
will be exactly 6: 10 and one quarter.
Buy war bonds.
Thank you, I will.
Hey, you guys,
the buses for Hollywood pulled up!
- Get me to Hollywood.
- Here we come.
- Here we go, boys. Come on.
- Hey.
- Give my regards to Lana Turner.
- Who needs a house in Hollywood?
Hey, sonny.
- Hello.
- What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
It's late at night,
where are you going?
- To join the Navy.
- Oh, well, you...
- Gonna what?
- I said, I'm going to join the Navy.
- Wait a minute.
- I'm in a hurry.
Take it easy. Where do you live?
- Why?
- Well, I wanna take you home.
But I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.
What's your name?
Look, it's my job
to find little boys that are lost.
Lost is when you don't know
where you're going.
And I do know,
I'm going to join the Navy.
- All right.
- Good night.
If that's the way you want it, okay.
You're coming to the station.
I don't wanna join the police.
I wanna join the Navy.
Stop there.
Are you following me?
What's with you?
Come on, spill it.
Well, you see, it's like this, Joe.
I've been in the Navy
a year and a half.
Every time we hit port
and get liberty...
...all I do is go to the library.
All right, so you like books,
what's the beef?
Well, I thought it'd be fun
to try something different...
...like going out with girls.
- Okay, good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Don't give me that "but."
After all, you're no yokel.
You're from Brooklyn.
Even in Brooklyn,
things can go wrong.
What do you mean?
Well, right from boys' high school...
...I went to the
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine...
...assistant choirmaster.
And out of there,
I went into the Navy.
I wouldn't tell that
to anyone but you, Joe.
Sure, sure, I'll keep it quiet.
What do you want,
a couple of phone numbers?
Oh, no, I'd be too scared to use them.
- When you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Lola?
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you kidding?
Oh, not what you think, Joe.
I thought I'd like
to string along and learn.
After all, you're the best wolf
in the whole Navy.
Well, you are.
And besides, you gotta help me, Joe.
You saved my life
and you owe me something.
I saved your life
so now I owe you something?
Have you gone crazy?
Look, I didn't ask you to save my life,
but you did.
- Now I figure you're responsible for me.
- Well, I don't.
What's the sense of having your life
saved if you can't have any fun with it?
Look, I got a lot to do
in the next four days.
I don't want anybody tailing me.
You say I owe you something.
Well, I don't see it,
but if I find a dame for you...
...and get you started,
will you call it quits?
Okay, let me see.
Well, we'll have to do
with what you've got.
First place, fix your hat.
Let me see a sample
of your technique.
You're you, see?
And I'm a dame coming down the street.
Pick me up.
I'm a dame, see? I'm coming down
the street, now come on.
I beg your pardon, miss.
Lady, could I possibly...?
Oh, no. No.
You gotta give it more:
Listen, Brooklyn, when you're going
hunting it's how you feel that counts.
If you feel like a mouse,
you'll be looking for cheese...
...that's what you'll get.
But if you feel like a wolf...
...nothing can go wrong,
you're in control.
Hey, sailors, one of you guys gotta
come down to station with me.
- Any choice? You'll do. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Please, let's not have
any unpleasantness.
I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me?
Just when I'm beginning
to feel like a wolf.
The secretary of the Navy
will have a say about this.
Washington will hear about it.
Who's in charge here?
That's what I wanna know.
- Ship ahoy!
- Are you the guy that had me pulled in?
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge? What's the idea?
- What are you...?
- Lf you've been inconvenienced...
...I'm sorry.
You see, this young man
thinks he should join the Navy.
We think he should go home.
Since he won't tell us
where he lives...
...we thought that maybe a sailor...
See?
So you wanna join the Navy, huh?
Aye, aye, sir.
Attention.
- Name?
- Don Martin, sir.
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.
My daddy was in the Navy...
...and he said that when
I was grown up, I could join.
And now I am grown up,
so I want to.
Well, sure, mate, but...
Well, look, it's this way.
There's sort of a rule in the Navy.
Before they'll take you, you need a letter
from your mom or dad saying it's okay.
But I don't have
a mother or father anymore.
I live with my Aunt Susie.
You think a letter from an aunt
would be all right?
Well, sure, that would be perfect.
Why don't you talk to her about it.
One of these guys
will take you home and...
- You.
- But I got...
- Gotta be a nursemaid and everything...
- Aunt Susie may not give me the letter...
...but if you asked her...
- You better come along too.
- Oh, no, I can't.
- You come along.
- No, I can't.
What am I gonna do about Lola?
I guess Aunt Susie
must be asleep, huh?
- She isn't home yet.
- I suppose the door is locked too.
Yes.
- But we can get in.
- How?
The way I got out.
Look out for my wagon.
"Dear Ms. Abbott,
Donald was a very good boy.
He's fast asleep.
So I went home. Mrs. Murphy."
I'll get you some candy.
- I know where Aunt Susie hides it.
- Wait a second.
- You think your aunt will be back soon?
- Oh, sure.
What do you mean, "oh, sure"?
How do you know?
Well, she lives here.
You know,
sometimes he talks like you.
Look, fellas...
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I don't want you to think I'd walk out...
Well, you gotta stay here with the kid
anyhow and talk to his aunt and...
Well, I got a date with a girl,
and there's no sense in all of us just...
Well, that's great. That's just dandy.
He's got a date with a girl. What's he
think I've got a date with, a duck?
Goodbye. Thanks, fellas.
Brooklyn, I'm blowing,
the baby's all yours.
Joe. Hey, Joe!
You can't leave me here,
what about my being a wolf?
- You promised me.
- You promised you'd talk to Aunt Susie.
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?
Okay. Okay.
Who's he calling?
A girl.
Lola, baby.
Forgotten you?
Oh, honey.
With the picture of you
I've got in my mind?
Why, even across the phone,
I can see every...
Look, let me tell you what happened.
- I found a kid that was lost.
- Joe, I wasn't lost.
So I had to take him home.
I won't be long.
As long as I get there?
Oh, honey, you know I'll get there.
Look, we better talk
about that later, huh?
- Yeah, goodbye.
- What are you going to talk about later?
Things, sailor. Things.
You'll understand
when you get older.
- Everybody keeps saying that to me.
- Yeah, they used to say that to me too.
Well, did you understand
when you got older?
Nope.
I wonder what could be keeping
that Aunt Susie.
What can an old lady
be doing out this late?
Susan, don't you wish
that you were up there?
I've never heard his voice sound so
beautiful. There's something about him.
He always gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.
Cut it! Print that.
Okay, children, you go home now
and thanks very much for the day.
No callback.
Good night.
- Mr. Iturbi, l...
- Good night, Susie.
Good night, Tom. L...
- How's that for camera?
- Right on the nose.
Tell me, Bill, when are we going
to shoot the boogie-woogie?
- Good night. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hi, Aunt Susie.
Well, what got you home so early,
your feet give out?
- What?
- Dames like you kill me.
Don't you ever think of anybody
but yourself?
Leaving the little kid alone while you're
out chasing around, having a big time.
Would you mind telling me
just who you are...
...and what you're doing here?
I'm a guy the police called
when they picked this kid up...
...wandering around the boulevard,
that's all.
That wouldn't interest you,
so if you step aside, lady...
- Well, just a moment. I don't...
- Don't apologize.
Just clear the deck.
Come on, Brooklyn.
But I...
- Bye.
- Aunt Susie.
- But, Aunt Susie...
- Joe. Hey, Joe. Listen, the kid's crying.
Well, if I had to live
with a dame like that, I'd cry too.
I thought she was sort of nice.
A dame that leaves a kid
alone that way ain't nice.
Wait a minute, please.
You didn't give me a chance.
- Donald explained and...
- Okay, okay.
It was all a mistake,
and you're sorry.
But my pal and I got plans
for the night.
- We'd like to get going.
- I haven't got a thing to do.
Well, I thought, if you didn't mind,
that you could come back for a while.
It's Donald, he's so upset
and it's way past his bedtime.
Well, sure we will.
We didn't even say goodbye.
Is something wrong, Joe?
I thought you'd gone.
Hey, hey, sailor, what is this?
What's with you?
You forgot about me.
About what you promised.
You know, the letter.
Oh, sure, the letter.
You see, it's this way.
The kid here wanted to join the Navy,
but I told him about the rule.
You know, the rule about needing a
letter from your folks saying it's okay.
Donald thought
if Joe asked you for the letter...
Oh, Donald, suppose you and I
talk about that in the morning.
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.
You want me to go with you,
don't you?
Well, sure, kid, but...
Wait a second,
there are a couple of things...
...you need beside the letter,
you gotta have a...
Can you read and write?
No, he can't.
He plays hooky all the time.
You mean to say
you can't read and write?
You think the Navy takes dopes?
Not ever?
Well, maybe sometimes. But even the
dopes have to be able to read and write.
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.
Joe, now what will I do?
Well, the first thing you gotta do,
you gotta go to school and study hard.
Before you know it,
you won't be a dope.
Now, young man,
how about going to bed, huh?
All right,
but I want Joe to put me to bed.
Oh, really, Donald.
We can't keep these gentlemen any
longer, they have other things to do.
No, they haven't. They're on leave.
We'd be very happy to put him to bed,
wouldn't we, Joe?
Oh, thank you,
but you've done enough already.
Joe?
Okay, okay, but no stalling.
Come on, you helper, you.
Hey, hit the sack, sailor.
Get in there.
Joe, you're coming back
to see me, promise?
Sure, sure, sure, that's a deal.
Come on, now, get in bed. Come on.
- All set?
- No, I always get sung to sleep.
Look what wants to join the Navy.
Hey, listen, bub, do you think
anybody sings us sailors to sleep?
But I'm not in the Navy yet.
So it's all right
for me to be sung to.
Well, he's right. He's right.
All right.
You sing to him.
After all, you're the choirmaster
around here, not me.
Oh, Joe.
I told you that
in the strictest of confidence.
And you promised
never to bring it up.
- They're asleep.
- Your friend too?
Well, I made some coffee.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...
Oh, it's nothing.
Is something wrong?
Oh, no.
- Well, did you have a nice nap?
- Come on, Brooklyn.
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, gotta blow. Thanks.
- Well, you've been awful nice.
- Forget it. So long.
Goodbye. Thanks. Thanks again.
Hey, Joe, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.
I know you're not gonna like this.
Remember what you
were gonna do for me?
About getting a girl, I mean.
I've seen the one I want.
- Oh, no. No, Brooklyn.
- But, Joe, you promised me.
Okay, I promised you,
but not Aunt Susie.
I didn't promise you Aunt Susie.
Good night.
But, Lola, it's not that late.
It's never that late.
Oh, baby, I know you're tired, but...
What do you mean, it's for my sake?
Well, honey,
I wouldn't be disappointed in you.
Oh, baby, I couldn't be.
Okay. Okay.
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.
Twelve o'clock?
In the morning?
Well, all right,
if that's what you want.
Goodbye.
- Gee, Joe, that's tough.
- Yeah. Hurry up, huh?
- What's the Navy coming to, bud?
- I ask myself that.
Say, Joe...?
Joe, I don't wanna
keep messing up your plans.
What I mean is, we won't have to look
for a girl for me tomorrow.
We've already found Aunt Susan.
Listen, Brooklyn, I didn't save your life
to hand it over to that character.
I'm gonna get you a dame
that's a dame.
Right now we gotta find
a place to sleep, so relax. Come on.
Oh, hello, fellas.
Shut up.
- Couple of empties down there, fellas.
- Thanks, pal.
- First night's leave for you guys?
- Yeah.
Well, do you wanna talk?
Sure, but we got in trouble,
we picked up a kid.
Yeah, yeah,
and what a little kid that was.
And what another little kid she had
waiting for us when we got home.
Such trouble we should run into
every night of our life.
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, Pittsburgh, how are you?
- Oh, boy, what a town this is.
- How do you like that?
I walk my feet off all night
and end up with a glass of beer.
You don't live right.
Oh, never in all my life
have I seen such dames.
This blond...
Not that there was anything wrong
with that redhead of yours.
Oh, no. No, no.
She was rather interesting.
Oh, interesting.
You should have seen the kid work.
- I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
- You took them home.
- Little slow at first. A little slow.
- Little slow.
I asked my girl for a kiss.
- She said no.
- Skip the details.
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you.
That's the way he started.
You should have seen this boy.
What technique.
I never saw such a stubborn dame
in my whole life.
And he's got muscles, too.
Tell them, Brooklyn.
Tell them how it is.
- True?
- True. True.
Got down on her bended knee to him!
Oh, this boy was sensational.
- Tell them all, Brooklyn.
- I'm telling them.
What like a wildcat.
Practically drew a gun on the boy.
What happened?
- Look at this.
- Give them the floor, boys.
What time is it?
Oh, it's early yet.
Yeah, I know, but what time is it?
What happened to that clock?
The phone! Where's the phone?
Hello. Hello, Lola. Listen, honey, l...
Well, then, who is it?
Oh, well, listen, this is Joe Brady.
Where's Lola?
Did she leave a message for me?
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?
Well, that's too bad
about you too, sister...!
Hey. Hey, don't hang up on me.
Let's leave a note, will you?
Tell her I'll call at 10...
Honest, Joe,
I can explain the whole thing.
Just give me a second,
I can explain.
You were sleeping like a baby,
and I didn't wanna disturb you.
I know you need your rest very badly.
I know you don't look good unless...
Joe, help! Help! Help!
Joe, help!
It's against the rules, really,
but we thought just this once...
...we ought to serve breakfast
up here.
After all,
you've been through so much.
Oh, thanks a lot.
You must appreciate
a buddy like Clarence.
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone
make a sound all morning?
We just crept around like little mice
so as not to wake you.
I never saw such devotion.
Oh, don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.
Oh, I'm sure Clarence
doesn't expect it.
Oh, no. Really, I don't. I'd hate it.
You poor, poor boy.
Forty-eight days and nights
on a raft.
Isn't this thrilling?
If you want any more coffee,
just let us know.
- And he looks so shy.
- I know, he's so sweet.
Joe. Joe, don't you think you ought
to eat some of this food?
It gets cold very quickly, you know.
Why don't you try the eggs.
They're very good.
Joe, I left you a razor in the shower,
there's a towel...
Clarence, you can wait on me
hand and foot.
You can polish my shoes,
you can be my slave.
But, Clarence...
...it won't do you any good.
Because I'm not going to help you
with Aunt Susan. Get it?
But, Joe...
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.
You promised him
you'd go back to see him.
Why, it's like breaking
the word of honor...
...of the whole United States Navy.
Clarence...
...I'm not going back to that house!
Look, I get you a date with her,
it washes us up.
I don't owe you a thing, right?
Okay. Here, take all this stuff.
It'll make an impression.
Let me look at you.
Well, it'll have to do.
Now, try, will you?
- Hello, Aunt Susie.
- Why...
Hello. Won't you come in?
We promised Donald
we'd come back and, well...
Brooklyn spent the whole afternoon
getting him toys.
Oh, that's awfully kind of you.
- Let's put them over here, huh?
- Where's he hiding?
Donald? Oh, he's down in school.
Thanks to you,
he went almost willingly today.
Oh, good.
Say, aren't you a little young
to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?
Well, I'm all the family he has.
His mother died when he was a baby,
and then his father.
His father left us this house,
and that helps quite a lot.
You see, I work,
and that keeps me...
...from being with Donald
as much as I'd like.
I never know when the studio
is going to call me.
- Gee, are you an actress?
- I wanna be a singer.
But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.
You ever get a chance
to do any singing?
No, but there are some
really great musicians.
There's Stokowski and José lturbi and
people like that who work in pictures.
There's always a chance that
I might get to sing for one of them.
- Any luck so far?
- No.
That's awful. That's terrible.
Thank you, Clarence.
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.
Please forgive me, but I really
should run up and dress now.
I'm sorry you missed Donald,
he'll be disappointed.
Well, as a matter of fact, we didn't
come just to see Donald, we...
Clarence, I'm going to tell her
whether you like it or not.
Clarence didn't sleep all night,
you know.
And do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.
Why, Clarence.
I told him that you'd understand
how it is, getting to a strange town...
...when you've been away at sea.
"She'll understand," I said,
"how important it is...
...when you finally do get
a little leave, to meet someone..."
Clarence, do you wanna take me out?
Is that what all this is leading up to?
- "She's a girl with a heart," I said...
- Well, I'd love to.
Honest?
I wish I could make it tonight,
but I'm busy.
- Boyfriend?
- Oh, no.
Just someone I met at the studio.
He should be here now,
so I really have to run up and dress.
You did mean what you said
about my calling you?
Well, of course. Any night that
you're free, you just give me a ring.
Goodbye.
And thank you again for Donald.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You know, I bet she's not so bad.
Gee, I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I liked her,
I said she wasn't bad.
Yeah, but coming from you.
Well, I guess if Aunt Susie likes him,
he must be okay.
Gee, that's a nice car, isn't it?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Aren't you even worried?
Once she goes out with him,
she'll turn up her nose at any place we...
I mean, that you could take her to.
Look, this means nothing to me,
I'm telling you for your own good.
Once she goes out with him,
brother, you're dead.
- Gee, you think so, Joe?
- Sure.
There isn't anything I can do about it.
Brooklyn, there's always something
you can do about everything.
Come on.
Did you want to see Ms. Abbott?
- She's upstairs dressing, I'll call her.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that, bud.
Susie hates to be bothered
when she's dressing.
Yeah, she hates it.
- Something wrong, jack?
- Oh, no. Nothing at all.
Well, then squat someplace, jack,
you're making me nervous.
My name is Bertram Kraler.
Bertram?
Are you good friends of Ms. Abbott's?
You might call it that.
- Are you?
- I just met her.
I'm taking her to dinner.
Maybe you know
what you're doing, Bertram...
...but I don't think
the boys will like it.
I beg your pardon? The boys?
The Navy. I don't think they're
gonna like Susie branching out this way.
But I don't quite...
Ms. Abbott knows
a great many Navy men?
Maybe some she doesn't know,
say a dozen or two maybe.
It's a funny thing.
You get onboard a new ship...
...don't know a soul,
kind of lonesome even.
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"
And right away
everybody's talking about her.
You know, it's kind of homey,
if you see what I mean.
Yes. Yes, I do. But, well,
she seems such a quiet girl.
Susie? Quiet?
Well, that's not what the song says
when the boys sing about her.
They never even mention
the word "quiet."
They sing about her?
The Navy's got a song about her?
- Sure.
- I don't believe it.
- Well, okay.
- All right, let me hear it.
Well, I don't think you'd better, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors, see?
Yeah. Yeah, it's not
your type of a song.
I insist on hearing it.
All right, Brooklyn,
if the man insists, let's play.
But, Joe, I don't think we ought to.
- Go ahead. Play that Susie song.
- Well, you start and I'll find you a key.
That is how she won her Navy E
Well, well, well.
I don't know what's the matter
with him, do you, Brooklyn?
Yes, and I wish I didn't.
Will you please tell Ms. Abbott
that Mr. Kraler regrets...
Regrets what?
What on earth is the matter?
What are you two doing here?
Mr. Kraler regrets what?
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.
Knowing your taste as I do now,
I'm sure the kind of evening...
...I'd planned wouldn't interest you.
S-U-S, S-U...
But, Mr. Kraler, l...
What did you say to him?
- What difference does it make?
- I'd like to know.
- What did you say to him?
- I kind of figured...
...you were stuck with him and...
It wasn't Brooklyn, really. It was me.
I don't understand why you think
I was stuck with him.
Well, I thought that you'd be glad
to get him off your hands.
- I thought you'd be grateful if l...
- And you thought I'd be grateful.
Well, yes, maybe, l...
I mean, if I were a dame and that...
If you were a dame and for one solid year
you'd been trying to get someplace...
...and you met a man whose mother
was in the philharmonic society...
...and who could introduce you
to very important people.
People like lturbi. I mean...
...I think this is the meanest
and the cruelest...
Don't cry. Please, don't cry.
Aunt Susie.
- Oh, go away.
- No.
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush
Bertram off without your okay.
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.
Oh, I know you didn't mean it...
...but it's just that
I might never get another chance.
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.
It's... Well, it's a surprise.
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
- Oh, he'd never tell you.
That's Clarence all over.
You know what he did
before he went into the Navy?
- He was the assistant...
- Joe!
Joe, remember
what you promised me.
Okay. At least I can tell her
you were in music, can't I?
And he was a big shot too.
Why, when you went upstairs
to change, he said to me:
"You know, if meeting lturbi
would do her any good...
...well, after all,
he's a friend of mine and..."
- He is, Clarence?
- They're pals.
As a matter of fact,
I once even heard lturbi say:
"It is I who should be grateful
to you, Clarence."
Remember? At San Diego?
Well, you know what Clarence did?
He just went to the phone
and called his pal lturbi...
...and arranged for you
to have an audition, that's all.
Oh, Clarence, you didn't.
Well, when...? When did he say?
- When?
- Go ahead, tell her when, Clarence.
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11: 15.
Oh, Clarence.
I'm sorry.
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me and...
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?
- What does he...?
- Look, I've got an idea.
No.
He has many things to tell you,
why don't you go out...
...have dinner and talk it over.
- I think that'd be a wonderful idea.
- Well, you come too.
- Please do, Joe.
- Look...
...you haven't got a thing to do
until 10:00, remember?
- Joe!
- Hiya, sailor.
You came! You came!
Don't tell me you've been
at school all this time?
Sure, I stayed to tell the teacher
what I had to study for the Navy.
She sure doesn't know much.
You mean you kept the teacher
until now?
- Of course. Hiya, Clarence.
- Hiya, Donald.
Come on, I'm gonna march you
over to Mrs. Murphy's.
- We're going out.
- I'll come too.
- Oh, no, you won't.
- But I gotta talk to Joe.
You can just talk to Joe
some other time.
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure. Sure.
Will you come in school to see me?
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay, it's a promise.
Come along, darling.
Hey, you dope.
You wanted a date with her, didn't you?
Wanted to be alone?
What do you wanna drag me along for?
Because I don't know
what lturbi said to me on the phone.
It's a wishing well.
Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.
Thanks to you, I got my wish.
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?
You better play it safe.
Now it's your turn.
No, no, not me. I got a theory called
"Wishing Don't Make It So."
You decide what you want
and then you go out and get it.
Come on.
- Oh, no, not again enchiladas.
- What else?
Enchiladas for all of us
and all the trimmings.
All right.
- Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- But you can't spend your money on us.
- I'm not.
- What are you gonna do? Wash dishes?
- Polish the silver?
- Scrub the floors?
That sounds reasonable.
Now, listen, you stay right here...
...and no matter what happens,
be brave.
- You're all set, I'm gonna go.
- You can't leave me alone.
How are you gonna get to know her
if you're never alone with her?
Besides, I wanna phone Lola.
We have Ms. Susan Abbott
to sing for you.
- Where is the phone?
- Oh, right up here.
Gee, I thought
you were wonderful, honest.
Joe went to make a phone call.
- He's a busy guy.
- He is?
He's the biggest wolf
in the whole Navy.
Yeah, they call him the sea wolf.
Well, that's what they call him.
Clarence, do you realize
that I don't know anything about you?
I mean, other than you're very nice...
...but tell me about yourself.
I'm fine.
Well, what sort of work
do you do in the Navy?
- Gun crew.
- Is it interesting?
It's keen.
- Well, we missed you.
- Susita...
...it was not bad this time.
It was great.
Well, I have wonderful news for you.
Guess for whom I'm going to sing
this Saturday morning at 11: 15.
José lturbi. The José lturbi.
- No.
- Yes.
Clarence is one of his best friends,
and he arranged it for me.
Wait, I must run. I must tell Mama.
I must tell Pedro. I must tell Manuel.
- I must tell everybody.
- But it's only an audition...
It's no use,
it'll be all over the street in five minutes.
Susan, you think
you ought to tell people?
I know you have a wonderful voice...
Yeah, but what if everything
didn't go just right?
Well, you've given me the opportunity,
and I want everyone to know about it.
If I fail, it's... Well, it's right
that they should know that too.
Yeah, I guess she's right.
Say, Clarence,
why don't you dance with Susan.
Sure. Do you wanna?
I mean, I'd like to if you'd like to.
I'd love to.
I only know how to waltz...
...and this isn't a...
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.
You know, you're a strange team,
you two.
Clarence is so shy...
...and you're so...
Well, you're a sea wolf.
Clarence told me you were.
Yeah, well,
dames are plenty crazy about him.
Nice dames, that is.
And not about you?
Nice dames, that is.
Well, I'm an altogether different
kind of a guy. You know, l...
Well, I'm never serious about things...
...but, well, Clarence,
he's always on the level.
All right, all right,
I know I should have tried, but I didn't.
Okay, so I'm a coward.
I don't know why, you tell me.
Gee whiz, why do I freeze
when she looks at me?
What makes people act this way
about people?
What makes anything?
Gee, you sing just like a bird.
- Brooklyn!
- Yeah, how do you know?
- Flatbush.
- Go on. Greenpoint.
- How do you like that?
- How do you like that?
Lmagine meeting a dame
all the way from Brooklyn.
Ain't it a small world?
Like my old lady used to say.
Hey, mister, you better sit down, huh?
The manager.
- Gee, are you all alone?
- No, I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.
Oh, he's my best friend.
Okay, maybe you know
what you're doing.
She's a swell one, all right, that girl.
And what a voice.
Yeah, she's wonderful.
She's just about the loveliest...
Only, you know something?
I can never talk to her.
I can never talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.
What's the matter with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?
Oh, you...
Oh, I mean... I mean, you're different.
You're from Brooklyn.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Most girls are so easy
to figure out, see?
- They are?
- Yeah, but you are...
One time you look kind of as if
you knew all the answers...
...and then 10 minutes later
you're just like a little kid.
Just when a guy starts thinking
he ought to buy you a doll...
...or an ice cream cone
or something...
...then all of a sudden
you're all grown up again.
I am?
Yeah.
And everything gets all kind of
mixed up and interesting.
I mean... Well, that's what Clarence
said about you.
You know,
he thinks about you all the time.
He does?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All the time.
I guess I'll be seeing you again
tomorrow night at the restaurant?
- Lf you don't mind going back there.
- Oh, I don't mind. It's a swell place.
Well.
Well.
It's been a lovely evening...
...and I don't know when
I've been so happy.
Good night.
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She's never been so happy.
Yeah, and if you stop to think
for a minute...
...maybe you'll figure out why.
- You mean lturbi?
- Yeah.
Why shouldn't she be happy,
with that big, beautiful audition...
...you fixed coming up?
Yes, Mr. Banick, I understand.
You've gotta have a pass
to get in, sailor.
I'll take care of that right away,
Mr. Banick. Yes, sir.
- Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.
- Well, I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?
- Well, not exactly.
- Well, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
I gotta talk to him. It's important.
Even just for a minute, can't you?
Really, there's nothing I can do. He's
very busy. He's on the stage, recording.
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.
- Roll it, Jim, please.
- Speed.
So the admiral went up on deck,
said to him, he said, "Gunner's Mate...
...Second Class Joe Brady,
what do you think we should do?"
So Joe said, "Well, sir..."
Because even in a battle...
...if you talk to an admiral,
you have to say "sir."
So Joe said...
Joe! Come on, kids, it's Joe.
Hi.
- I was just telling them about you.
- Yeah, so I heard.
- Where's Aunt Susie? I thought she...
- She had to go to the studio.
Listen, Joe, I told the kids you'd tell us
all about your adventures.
Oh, look, l... Honest...
All right, all right.
Sit down, sit down.
Oh, boy.
Tell us how you got your medal.
All right,
I'll tell you how I got my medal.
Now, close your eyes...
...and try to imagine the most
beautiful day you've ever seen.
