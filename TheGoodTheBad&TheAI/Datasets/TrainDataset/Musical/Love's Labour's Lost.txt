You three,...
..Berowne,...
..Dumaine...
..and Longaville,...
..Have sworn for three years' term
to live with me,...
..My fellow-scholars,...
..and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this... schedule here.
Your oaths are passed,
and now subscribe your names,...
..That his own hand
may strike his honour down...
..That violates the smallest branch herein.
lf you are armed to do as sworn to do,...
..Subscribe to your deep oaths,...
..and keep it too.
l am resolved:
..'tis but a three years' fast.
The mind shall banquet...
..though the body pine.
To love, to wealth, to pomp,
l pine and die,...
..With all these living in philosophy.
So much, dear liege,
l have already sworn,...
..That is, to live and study
here three years.
But there are other strict observances:
..As not to see a woman in that term,...
..And one day in a week
to touch no food,...
..And but one meal on every day besides.
And then to sleep
but three hours in the night,...
..And not be seen to yawn of all the day.
O,...
..these are barren tasks, too hard to keep:
..Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
Your oath is passed
to pass away from these.
Let me say no, an if you please.
l only swore to study with your grace...
..And stay here in your court
for three years' space.
You swore to that, Berowne,
and to the rest.
By yea and nay, sir, then l swore in jest.
What is the end of study, let me know?
Why, that to know
which else we should not know.
Things hid and barred
from common sense?
Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
As thus, to study where l well may dine,
When l to feast expressly am forbid;
..Or study where to meet
some mistress fine,...
..When mistresses
from common sense are hid.
These be the stops
that hinder study quite...
..And train our intellects to vain delight.
Why, all delights are vain!
### l've seen for days that you've got
some ways that must be checked
### ln you l never can detect
### The slightest sign of intellect
### You're mad on dances,
think of the chances you neglect
### You never seem inclined
to use your mind
### You're just a fella who
has got his brains in his dancing shoes
### Take a lesson from me
### l'd rather charleston
### Di-di do-do
### Think of what you might be
### l'd rather charleston
### Do-doop di-do
### l'm disappointed in you and your ways
### l'm double-jointed,
there's no sensation like syncopation
### Will you let me know why?
### l'd rather charleston
### Charleston?
### That's the sort of thing
l would never do, so
### Leave it behind and
give your mind to something new
### l'd rather charleston, charleston
### Charleston, charleston
### Charleston with you!
Well, sit you out.
Go home, Berowne: adieu.
No, my good lord,
l have sworn to stay with you.
But there are other strict observances:
''..That no woman
shall come within a mile of my court''?
- Hath this been proclaimed?
- Four days ago.
Let's see the penalty.
''On pain of losing her tongue''!
- Who devised this penalty?
- Marry, that did l.
Sweet lord, and why?
To fright them hence
with the dread penalty.
A dangerous law against gentility.
''ltem. lf any man be seen to talk with
a woman within the term of three years,...
..he shall endure such public shame as
the rest of the court can possible devise.''
This article, my liege, yourself must break
For well you know...
..here comes in embassy the French
King's daughter with yourself to speak -
..A maid of grace and complete majesty -
..About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father.
Therefore this article is made in vain,...
..Or vainly comes
th'admired Princess hither.
What say you, lords?
Why, this was quite forgot.
We must of force dispense with
this decree. She must lie here on mere...
..necessity.
Necessity will make us all forsworn
..For every man with his affects is born,...
..Not by might mastered,
but by special grace.
lf l break faith, this word shall speak for
me: l am forsworn ''on mere necessity''.
So to the laws at large l write my name,...
..And he that breaks them
in the least degree...
..Stands in attainder of eternal shame.
Suggestions are to others as to me;
..But l believe, although l seem so loath,...
..l am the last...
..that will last break...
..his oath.
Good Boyet,
You are not ignorant all-telling fame...
..Doth noise abroad
Navarre hath made a vow,...
..Till painful study
shall outwear three years,...
..No woman may approach
his silent court.
Therefore to's
it seemeth a needful course,...
..Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure and in that behalf,...
..Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him the daughter
of the King of France,...
..On serious business,
craving quick dispatch,...
..lmportunes personal conference
with his grace.
Proud of employment, willingly l go.
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Who are the votaries, my maids,...
..That are vow-fellows
with this virtuous Duke?
Lord Longaville is one.
- Know you the man?
- l know him, madam.
At a marriage feast
ln Normandy, saw l this Longaville.
- Who are the rest?
- The young Dumaine.
- l saw him at the Duke Alencon's once.
-
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him,...
..if l have heard a truth.
Berowne they call him.
God bless my ladies! Are they all in love?
- Here comes Boyet.
- What admittance, lord?
Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
And he and his competitors in oath...
..Were all addressed to meet you,
gentle lady, before l came.
Marry, thus much have l learned:
..He rather means to lodge you...
in the field.
Fair Princess,
welcome to the court of Navarre.
''Fair'' l give you back again,
and ''welcome'' l have not yet.
The roof of this court
is too high to be yours,...
..and welcome to the wide fields
too base to be mine.
You shall be welcome, madam,
to my court.
l will be welcome then.
Conduct me thither.
Hear me, dear lady:
l have sworn an oath.
Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.
Not for the world, by my will.
- Will shall break it; will, and nothing else.
- Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
Were my lord so,
his ignorance were wise.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me, l am too sudden bold;
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose
of my coming...
- ..And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
- Madam, l will, if suddenly l may.
You will the sooner that l were away, for
you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
Sir,...
..l pray you... a word.
What lady is that same?
The heir of Alencon,
Katherine her name.
A gallant lady.
Monsieur, fare you well.
Katherine.
l beseech you a word.
What is she in the green?
A woman sometimes,
if by daylight she's seen.
Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
- Her mother's, l have heard.
- God's blessing on your beard!
Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.
Nay,...
..my choler is ended.
She...
..is a most... sweet lady.
Not unlike, sir, that may be.
- What's her name in the cap?
- Rosaline, by good hap.
ls she wedded or no?
To her will sir, or so.
O, you are welcome, sir.
Adieu.
Farewell to me, sir,...
..and welcome to you.
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of 100,000 crowns,...
..Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we - as neither have -
Received that sum,...
..yet there remains unpaid
You do the King my father
too much wrong...
..And wrong the reputation
of your name,...
..ln so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
l never heard of it.
lf you prove it, l'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum.
Satisfy me so.
So please your grace,
the packet is not come...
..Where that and other specialties
are bound.
Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.
lt shall suffice me.
Meantime,...
..receive such welcome at my hand
As honour, without breach of honour, may
..Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
You may not come, fair Princess,
within my gates,...
..But here without
you shall be so received...
..As you shall deem yourself
lodged in my heart.
Tomorrow shall we visit you again.
Did not l dance with you in Brabant once?
Did not l dance with  in Brabant once?
l know you did.
How needless was it then
To ask the question!
### l won't dance
Don't ask me
### l won't dance
Don't ask me
### l won't dance
### Monsieur, with you
### My heart won't let my feet
do things they should do
### You know what? You're lovely
### And so what, l'm lovely
### But, oh, what you do to me
### l'm like an ocean wave
that's bumped on the shore
### l feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
### When you dance
you're charming and you're gentle
### Specially when you do the continental
### But this feeling isn't purely mental
### For heaven rest us
l'm not asbestos
### And that's why
### l won't dance
Why should l?
### l won't dance
How could l?
### l won't dance
### l know that music
leads the way to romance
### So if l hold you in my arms
### l won't dance!
lf my observation,
which very seldom lies...
..By the heart's still rhetoric
disclosed with eyes,...
..Deceive me not now,
Navarre is infected.
With what?
With that which we lovers
entitle ''affected''.
Your reason?
His face's own margin
did quote such amazes...
..That all eyes saw his eyes
enchanted with gazes.
l'll give you Aquitaine, and all that is his,...
..An you give him for my sake
but one loving kiss.
Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is disposed!
But to speak that in words
which his eye hath disclosed.
l only have made a mouth of his eye
By adding a tongue...
..which l know will not lie.
Thou art an old love-monger,
and speakest skilfully.
- Do you hear, my mad wenches?
- No.
- What then, do you see?
- Ay,...
..our way to be gone.
You are too hard for me.
The matter is to me, sir,
as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is,
l was taken with the manner.
- ln what manner?
- ln manner and form following, sir.
l was seen with her in the manor-house,...
..sitting with her upon the form,
and taken following her into the park,...
..which, put together,
is ''in manner and form following''.
From the west corner
of thy curious-knotted garden.
There did l see that low-spirited swain,
that base minnow of thy mirth...
- Me?
- That unlettered, small-knowing soul...
- Me?
- That shallow vassal...
- Still me?
- Which, as l remember, is Costard.
O, me!
Sorted and consorted,...
..contrary to thy established
proclaimed edict and continent canon,...
..with... with...
..O, with - but with this
l passion to say wherewith...
- With a wench.
- With a child...
..of our grandmother Eve, a female,...
..or, for thy more sweet understanding,...
..a woman.
l, as my ever-esteemed duty
pricks me on, have brought to thee,...
..to receive the meed of punishment, by
thy good grace's officer, Anthony Dull,...
..a man of good repute, carriage,
bearing and
O, me. l am Dull.
For Jaquenetta,
so is the weaker vessel called...
..which l apprehended
with the aforesaid swain,...
..l keep her...
..as a vessel of thy law's fury,...
..and shall, at the least
of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial.
Thine in all compliments of
devoted and heartburning heat of duty,...
..Don Adriano de Armado!
Sirrah, what say you to this?
Sir, l...l...l...
- l... Whoa! l confess the wench.
- Did you hear the proclamation?
l do confess much of the hearing it,
but little of the marking of it.
A year's imprisonment
to be taken with a wench.
l was taken with none, sir;
l was taken with a damsel.
lt was proclaimed damsel.
This was no damsel neither, sir;
she was a virgin.
lt is so varied too,
for it was proclaimed virgin.
lf it were, l deny her virginity:
l was taken with a maid.
- This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
- This maid will serve my turn, sir.
Sir, l will pronounce your sentence:
..you shall fast a week
with bran and water.
l'd rather pray a month
with mutton and porridge.
- And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
-
Boy,...
..what sign is it when a man
of great spirit grows melancholy?
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
Pretty and apt.
l have promised to study
three years with the King.
But you are a gentleman
and a gamester, sir.
l confess both.
They are both the varnish
of a complete man.
A most fine figure!
l will hereupon confess...
..l am in love.
And as it is base for a soldier to love,...
..so am l in love with a base wench.
Boy, l do love that country girl
that l took in the park...
..with the rational hind Costard.
Sing, boy.
My spirit grows heavy in love.
### My story is much too sad to be told
### But practically everything
leaves me totally cold
### The only exception l know is the case
### When l'm out on a quiet spree
### Fighting vainly the old ennui
### And l suddenly turn and see
### Your fabulous face
### l get no kick from champagne
### Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
### So tell me, why should it be true
### That l get a kick out of you?
### l get no kick from cocaine
### l'm sure that if l took even one sniff
### That would bore me terrifically, too
### Yet l get a kick out of you
-
-
### l get a kick
### Every time l see you
### Standing there before me
### l get a kick though it's clear to me
### You obviously don't adore me
### l get no kick in a plane
### Flying too high with some girl in the sky
-  Argh!
- ### lt's my idea of nothing to do
### Yet l get a kick
### l'm sure it's a kick
### l get a kick out of you
Sir,...
..the King's pleasure is
that you keep Costard safe;
..and you must suffer him
to take no delight,...
..but he must fast... three days a week.
For this damsel,
l must keep her at the lodge.
- Fare thee well.
- Psst!
- Maid.
- Man.
l will visit thee at the lodge.
- That's hereby.
- l know where it is situate.
Lord, how wise you are!
l shall tell thee wonders.
With that face?
l... love thee.
So...
..l heard you say.
### l wake up every morning
with a smile on my face
### Everything in its place, as it should be
### l start out every morning,
just as free as the breeze
### My cares up on the shelf
because l find myself
### With no strings, no connections
### No ties to my affections
### l'm fancy-free
and free for anything fancy
### No dates that can't be broken
### No words that can't be spoken
### Especially when l am feeling romancey
### Like a robin upon a tree
### Like a sailor that goes to sea
### Like an unwritten melody
### l'm free, that's me
### Bring on the big attraction
### My decks are cleared for action
### l'm fancy-free
and free for anything fancy
### Bring on the big attraction
### My decks are cleared for action
### l'm fancy-free
and free for anything fancy
Sirrah?
- Costard!
-
Bear this significant to
the country maid Jaquenetta.
There is...
Ooh!
Now will l look to his
O, that's the Latin word
for three farthings.
My good knave Costard,
exceedingly well met.
Pray you, sir,...
how much carnation ribbon...
..may a man buy for a
What's a
- What's a
-
Marry, sir, halfpenny-farthing.
Why then, three-farthing-worth of silk.
Ah, l thank your worship. God be wi'you.
Stay, slave! l must employ thee.
As thou wilt win my favour,
Do one thing for me that l shall entreat.
- When, sir?
- This afternoon.
- l will do it, sir. Fare you well.
- Thou knowest not what it is.
l shall know, sir, when l have done it.
Why, villain, thou must know first.
l will come to you tomorrow morning.
lt must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
lt is but this:
..The Princess comes to hunt
here in the park,...
..And in her train there is a gentle lady;
..When tongues speak sweetly,
then they name her name,...
..And Rosaline they call her.
Euch!
Ask for her...
..And to her white hand see thou do
commend this sealed-up counsel. Mm?
There's thy guerdon: go!
Guerdon, O sweet guerdon!
O, elevenpence-farthing better.
Most sweet guerdon!
l shall do it, sir, in print!
Whoa! Ha-ha.
Pray you which is the head lady?
Thou shalt know her, fellow,
by the rest that have no heads.
Which is the greatest lady,
the highest?
-  The thickest and the tallest.
- The thickest and the tallest. Oh!
Are not you the chief woman? Hm?
- You are the thickest here.
-
- What's your will, sir? What's your will?
- Hm.
- l have a letter.
-
-
- Whoa.
A letter from Monsieur Berowne
to one Lady Rosaline.
Boyet, you can carve:
Break up this capon.
l am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook;
it importeth none here.
lt is writ to Jaquenetta.
l do affect the very ground,
which is base,...
..where her shoe, which is baser,...
..guided by her foot, which is basest,
doth tread.
''Thine in the dearest design of industry,
Don Adriano de Armado.''
-
- Did you ever hear better?
Thou, fellow, a word.
Who gave thee this letter?
Ah! l told you: my lord... l...
To whom shouldst thou give it?
- From my lord to my lady.
- From which lord to which lady?
From my lord Berowne, a good master of
mine, to a lady of France that he called...
Ah!
Thou hast mistaken his letter.
Come, friends, away!
Guerdon.
Ah!
Thou monster lgnorance,
how deformed dost thou look!
Madam, he hath never fed of the dainties
that are bred in a book.
He hath not eat paper, as it were;
..he hath not drunk ink.
His intellect is not replenished;
..he is only an animal,...
..only sensible in the... duller... parts.
And such barren plants are set before us
that we thankful should be -
..Which we of taste and feeling are -
..for those parts
that do... fructify in us more than he.
Good Master Parson,...
..be so good as to read me this letter.
lt was given me by Costard
and sent me from Don Armado.
l beseech you read it.
What are the contents?
What, my soul,...
..verses?
Ay, madam, and very learned.
Let me hear a staff,...
..a stanza, a verse.
### Some day, when l'm awfully low
### When the world is cold
### l will feel a glow just thinking of you
### And the way you look tonight
### Oh, but you're lovely
With your smile so warm
### And your cheek so soft
### There is nothing for me but to love you
### Just the way you look tonight
### With each word your tenderness grows
### Tearing my fear apart
### And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
### Touches my foolish heart
### Lovely
Never, never change
### Keep that breathless charm
### Won't you please arrange it?
Cos l love you
### Just the way you look tonight
### Just the way you look
### To-
### ..night
A rare talent!
This is a gift that l have - simple, simple;
a foolish extravagant spirit,...
..full of forms, figures,
shapes, objects, ideas,...
..apprehensions, motions, revolutions.
These are begot
in the ventricle of memory,...
..nourished in the womb
of  and...
..delivered upon
the mellowing of occasion.
But the gift is good
in those in whom it is acute,...
..and l am thankful for it.
Madam, l praise the Lord for you,
and so may my parishioners,...
..for their daughters
are well tutored by you,...
..and their sons profit
very greatly under you.
But, domicella...
..virgin,...
- ..was this directed to you?
- Ay, madam.
l will overglance the superscript.
''To the snow-white hand
of the most beauteous Lady... Rosaline.''
l will look again
on the intellect of the letter,...
..for the nomination of the party
writing to the person written unto:
..''Your Ladyship's
in all desired employment, Berowne.''
Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne
is one of the votaries with the King,...
..and here he hath framed a letter
to a sequent of the stranger princess,...
..which accidentally, or by way
of progression, hath miscarried.
Trip and go, my sweet,...
..deliver this paper into the royal hand
of the King; it may concern much.
Have with thee, my girl.
Madam, you have done this
in the fear of God, very religiously.
Mm, but to return to the...
### Verses
Did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?
Marvellous well.
l beseech your... society.
And thank you too, for society,...
..saith the text, is the happiness of life.
By the Lord,...
..this love is as mad as...
..Ajax.
lt kills sheep,...
..it kills me -
..l a sheep.
l will not love;
..if l do, hang me! l'faith, l will not.
O, but her eye!
By this light,
but for her eye, l would not love her -
..yes, for her two eyes.
Well, l do nothing in the world but lie,
and lie in my throat.
By heaven, l do love, and it hath taught
me to rhyme, and to be melancholy.
And here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy.
Well, she hath one o'my sonnets already.
The clown bore it, the fool sent it,
and the lady hath it.
Sweet clown, sweeter fool,...
..sweetest lady!
By the world, l would not care a pin
if the other three were in.
Whoa!
Eeeh!
-
- Aahh!
### How glad the many millions
Of Anabels and Lillians would be
Mmm...
### To capture me
### But you with your persistence
### You wore down my resistance
### l fell
### And it was swell
### l'm your big and brave
and handsome Romeo
### How you won me, l shall never
### Never
### Know...
Now, in thy likeness,
one more fool appear!
### lt's not that you're attractive
### But oooh
My heart grew active
### When you came in-
- Ah!
- ### ..to view
### l've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
### All the day and night-time
hear me sigh
### l never had the least notion
### That l could fall with so much emotion
### Could you coo
### Could you care
### For a country cottage we could share
### The world will pardon my mush
### Cos l've got a crush, my baby, on you
### The world will pardon my mush
### Cos l've got a crush, my baby
### My baby
### A crush, my baby, on you
Ugh!
Dumaine,...
..thy love is far from charity,...
..You may look pale,
but l should blush, huh?
l know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
Come, sir, you blush!
As his your case is such.
You chide at him,
offending twice as much.
l have been closely shrouded
in this bush,...
..And marked you both,
and for you both did blush.
l heard your guilty rhymes,
observed your fashion,...
..Saw sighs reek from you,
noted well your... passion.
What will Berowne say
when that he shall hear...
..Faith so infringed
which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn,
how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever l did see,...
..l would not have him
know so much by me.
Ah, good my liege,
l pray thee pardon me.
Whoa.
Ah!
Good heart, what grace
hast thou thus to reprove...
..These worms for loving,
that art most in love?
Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?
Not you to me,...
..but l betrayed by you;
..l that am honest,...
..l that hold it sin...
..To break the vow l am engaged in -
..l am betrayed by keeping company
With men like you,...
..men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me
write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for Joan?
When shall you hear that l
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,...
..A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb -
Soft! Whither away so fast?
God bless the King!
-  What present hast thou there?
- Some certain treason.
What makes treason here?
l beseech your grace
let this letter be read.
Our person misdoubts it;
'twas treason, he said.
- Berowne,...
-
..read it over.
- Where hadst thou it?
- Of Costard.
- Where hadst thou it?
- Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
- Don Arbnar, Carbonara... the Don.
-
How now, what is in you?
Why dost thou tear it?
A toy, my liege, a toy.
Your grace need not fear it.
lt did move him to passion
and therefore let's hear it.
Ah-ah!
lt is Berowne's writing...
and here is his name.
Ah, you whoreson loggerhead,
you were born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty:
..l confess,...
- ..l confess.
- What?
That you three fools lacked me fool
to make up the mess.
He, he and you - and you, my liege - and l
Are pick-purses in love...
..and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience
and l shall tell you more.
- Now the number is even.
- True, true, we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?
Hence, sirs, away!
Walk aside the true folk
and let the traitors stay.
Have at you then, affection's men-at-arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto:
..To fast, to study and to see no woman -
..Flat treason 'gainst
the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast?
Your stomachs are too young,
And abstinence engenders maladies.
For when would you, my liege,
or you, or you,...
..Have found the ground
of study's excellence...
..Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine l derive:
..They are the ground,
the books, the academes,...
..From whence doth spring
the true Promethean fire.
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,...
..And in that vow
we have forsworn our books;
..For when would you, my liege,
or you, or you,...
..ln leaden contemplation
have found out...
..Such fiery numbers
as the prompting eyes...
..Of beauty's tutors
have enriched you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain,...
..And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
..But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,...
..Lives not alone immured in the brain
But with the motion of all elements...
..Courses as swift
as thought in every power...
..And gives to every power
a double power,...
..Above their functions and their offices.
lt adds a precious seeing to the eye:
..A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound.
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible...
..Than are the tender horns
of cockled snails.
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus
gross in taste,...
..For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical...
..As bright Apollo's lute,
strung with his hair.
And when Love speaks,...
..the voice of all the gods...
..Make heaven drowsy...
..with the harmony.
Heaven.
l'm in heaven.
### And my heart beats
so that l can hardly speak
### And l seem to find the happiness l seek
### When we're out together
### Dancing
### Cheek
### To cheek
### Heaven
### l'm in heaven
### And the cares that hang around me
through the week
### Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak
### When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek
### Dance with me
### l want my arm about you
### And the charm about you
### Will carry me through
### To heaven
### l'm in heaven
### And my heart beats so
that l can hardly speak
### And l seem to find the happiness l seek
### When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek
### Heaven
### l'm in heaven

that l can hardly speak
### And l seem to find the happiness l seek
### When we're out together

Shall we...
..resolve to woo these girls of France?
And win them too!
Therefore let us devise some
entertainment for them in their tents.
First, from the park
let us conduct them thither.
Then homeward every man
attach the hand of his fair mistress.
ln the afternoon we will
with some strange pastime solace them,...
..Such as the shortness
of the time can shape;
..For revels, dances, masques,
and merry hours...
..Forerun fair Love,
strewing her way with flowers.
Away, away! No time shall be omitted
That will betime and may by us be fitted.
Yes! Yes!
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich
ere we depart.
Look you what l have
from the loving King.
But, Rosaline, you have a favour too:
..Who sent it? And what is it?
Nay, l have verses too, l thank Berowne.
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
Anything like?
But, Katherine, what was sent to you
from fair Dumaine?
Madam, this glove.
This... and these pearls to me
sent Longaville.
O, we are wise girls
to mock our lovers so.
They are worse fools
to purchase mocking so.
Here comes Boyet,
and mirth is in his face.
Arm, wenches, arm!
Encounters mounted are
Against your peace.
Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments: you'll be surprised.
Under the shade of a sycamore l thought
to close mine eyes some half an hour,...
..When, lo,
to interrupt my purposed rest,...
..Toward that shade
l might behold addressed...
- ..The King and his companions.
-
Warily
l stole into a neighbour thicket by...
..And overheard what you shall overhear:
..That, by and by,
disguised they will be here.
- Ooh!
- Their herald is a pretty knavish page.
But what, but what, come they to visit us?
They do, they do,
and are apparelled thus,...
..Like masked delights
or revellers, as l guess.
Their purpose is to
parley, court and dance,...
..and every one his love-suit will advance
Unto his several mistress,...
..which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.
And will they so?
The gallants shall be tasked;
..For, ladies,
we will every one be masked,...
..And not a man of them shall have the
grace, despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, take thou this and give me thine,
So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.
And change you favours too;
..so shall your loves
Woo contrary,...
..deceived by these removes.
Come on, then,
wear the favours most in sight.
- But in this changing what is your intent?
- The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.
They do it but in mockery merriment,
And mock for mock is only my intent!
The tongues of mocking wenches
are as keen...
..As is the razor's edge invisible,...
..Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen.
### There may be trouble ahead
### But while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
### Let's face the music and dance
### Before the fiddlers have fled
### Before they ask us to pay the bill
### And while we still have the chance
### Let's face the music and dance
### Soon we'll be without the moon
### Humming a different tune
### And then
### There may be teardrops to shed
### So while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
### Let's face the music and dance, dance
### Let's face the music and dance
### Soon we'll be without the moon
### Humming a different tune
### And then
### There may be teardrops to shed
### So while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
### Let's face the music and dance, dance
### Let's face the music and dance
Are these the breed of wits
so wondered at?
But will you hear?
The King is my love sworn.
And quick Berowne
hath plighted faith to me.
And Longaville was for my service born.
Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
lmmediately they will again be here...
..ln their own shapes, for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.
- Will they return?
- O, they will, God knows.
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do...
..lf they return
in their own shapes to woo?
Good madam, if by me you'll be advised...
..Let's mock them still,
as well known as disguised.
Let us complain to them
what fools were here.
Ladies, withdraw.
The gallants are at hand.
Fair sir, God save you.
- Where's... Where's the Princess?
- Gone... to her tent.
Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?
That she vouchsafe me audience
for one word.
l will; and so will she,...
..l know, my lord.
We came to visit you and purpose now
To lead you to our court.
Vouchsafe it then.
Now, by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, l protest,...
..A world of torments
though l should endure,...
..l would not yield
to be your house's guest,...
..So much l hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.
O,...
..you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
Not so, my lord. lt is not so, l swear.
We have had pastimes here
and pleasant game.
How, madam?
ln truth, my lord.
Trim gallants,
full of courtship and of state.
Madam, speak true!
Here they stayed an hour
And talked apace;
..and in that hour they did not bless us
with one happy word.
Which of the visors was it that you wore?
- Where?
- What visors?
- Why demand you this?
- That visor:
..that superfluous case that hid the worse
and showed the better face.
We were descried.
They'll mock us now downright.
Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
Amazed, my lord?
Why looks your highness sad?
Why look you pale?
l see the trick.
Here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,...
- ..To dash it like a Christmas comedy.
-
Some carry-tale, some please-man,
some slight zany,...
..Some mumble-news,
some trencher-knight, some Dick...
..That smiles his cheek in years
and knows the trick...
..To make my lady laugh
when she's disposed,...
..Told our intents before; which, once
disclosed, the ladies did change favours...
..and then we, following the signs,
wooed but the sign of she.
Oh!
Berowne, they will shame us.
- Let them not approach.
- We are shame-proof, my lord;
..and 'tis some policy to have one show
worse than the King's and his company.

God save you, madam.
Welcome, Mercade,...
..But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
l am sorry, madam, for the news l bring
ls heavy in my tongue.
The King,...
..your father -
Dead,...
..for my life!
Even so;
..my tale is told.
Worthies, away.
The scene begins to cloud.
How fares your majesty?
Boyet, prepare. l will away tonight.
- Madam, not so. l do beseech you, stay.
- Prepare, l say.
l thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavours, and entreat,..
..Out of a new-sad soul,
that you vouchsafe...
..ln your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,...
..lf over-boldly we have borne ourselves
ln the converse of breath.
Your gentleness
Was guilty of it.
Farewell, worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For your great suit so easily obtained.
The extreme parts of time
extremely forms...
..All causes to the purpose of his speed
And often at his very loose decides...
..That which long process
could not arbitrate.
Though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love...
..The holy suit
which fain it would convince,...
..yet, since love's argument
was first on foot,...
..Let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it
From what it purposed.
l understand you not.
My griefs are double.
Honest plain words
best pierce the ear of grief;
..And by these badges
understand the King.
For your fair sakes
have we neglected time,...
..Played foul play with our oaths.
Your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deformed us,...
..fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents;
..And what in us hath seemed ridiculous.
Those heavenly eyes that look into
those faults, suggested us to make them.
Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours,...
..the error that love makes
ls likewise yours.
We have received your letters full of love,
Your favours, the ambassadors of love,...
..And in our maiden counsel rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,...
..As bombast and as lining to the time.
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been;
..and therefore met your loves
ln their own fashion, like a merriment.
- Our letters showed much more than jest.
- So did our looks.
We did not quote them so.
Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.
A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord,...
..your grace is perjured much,...
..Full of dear guiltiness;
..and therefore this:
..lf for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught,...
..this shall you do for me:
..Your oath l will not trust,
but go with speed...
..To some forlorn and naked hermitage.
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
lf this austere insociable life change not
your offer made in heat of blood;
..Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me,...
..challenge me by these deserts,...
..And, by this virgin palm
now kissing thine, l will be thine.
And, till that instance, shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,...
..Raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father's death.
Hence, hermit then -
..my heart... is in thy breast.
What says Maria?
At the twelvemonth's end...
..l'll change my black gown
for a faithful friend.
l'll stay with patience,...
..but the time is long.
A twelvemonth and a day l'll mark
no words that smooth-faced wooers say.
Come when the King doth
to my lady come;
..Then, if l have much love,...
..l'll give you some.
l'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
Yet swear not,...
..lest ye be forsworn again.
Mistress, look on me.
Behold the window of my heart,
mine eye,...
..What humble suit
attends thy answer there.
lmpose some service on me for thy love.
Oft have l heard of you, my lord Berowne,
Before l saw you,...
..and the world's large tongue...
..Proclaims you for a man
replete with mocks,...
..Full of comparisons
and wounding flouts,...
..Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood
from your fruitful brain...
..And therewithal to win me,...
..if you please -
..Without the which l am not to be won -
..You shall this twelvemonth term
from day to day...
..Visit the speechless sick and
still converse with groaning wretches;
..and your task shall be
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit...
..To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
To move wild laughter in the throat
of death? lt cannot be, it is impossible.
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
Why, that's the way
to choke a gibing spirit,...
..Whose influence is begot
of that loose grace...
..Which shallow laughing hearers
give to fools.
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it,...
..never in the tongue
Of him that makes it.
Then, if sickly ears,...
..Deafed with the clamour
of their own dear groans,...
..Will hear your idle scorns,
continue then,...
..And l will have you and that fault withal;
..But if they will not,
throw away that spirit,...
..And l shall find you empty of that fault,...
..Right joyful of your reformation.
A twelvemonth?
Well,...
..befall what will befall,...
..l'll jest a twelvemonth...
..in an hospital.
Ay, sweet my lord, and so l take my leave.
No, madam,
we will bring you on your way.
Our wooing doth not end like an old play:
Jack hath not Jill.
Come, sir,
it wants a twelvemonth and a day,...
..And then 'twill end.
That's too long for a play.
Sir.
