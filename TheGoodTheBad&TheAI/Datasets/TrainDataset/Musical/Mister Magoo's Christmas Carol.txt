Only thing to be
said for the season,
people feel obligated
to pay their debts.
Oh, wouldn't old Jacob
Marley have been proud.
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?
Mr. Marley has been
dead these seven years.
We have no doubt his
liberality is well
represented by his
surviving partner.
At this festive season of
the year, Mr. Scrooge,
'tis more than usually desirable we
should make some slight provisions
Hundreds of thousands are in
want of common comforts, Sir.
And the workhouses, uh, are
they, uh, still in operation?
They are. Still I wish I
could say, they were not.
I support the establishments
I have mentioned,
they cost enough, and those who
are badly off, eh, must go there.
Many can't go there, and
many would rather die.
If they would rather die,
they had better do it
and decrease the
surplus population.
Now, well, let's
see, where was I?

you wouldn't have time

Be gone you miserable little beggars,
before I give you something to sing about!
Ah, don't you understand
the King's English?
Nothing to eat and they
sing of Christmas.
I might as well close
shop for the night.
Oh, but, Sir, tomorrow
is Christmas Day.
Oh, yes, Sir. Please,
Sir, you see I...
Never mind! It's Christmas.
Oh Lord, help us.
Hea, hea, hea. The whole
population is mad!
Will you stop! I'm,
I'm quite capable.
A..very..Merry
Christmas to you, Sir.
Out upon Merry Christmas.
If I could work my will
every fool who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips
should be boiled
with his own pudding
and buried with a stake of
holly through his heart.
Mean weather. It's the
worst I can remember.
Err, Perhaps I do
need spectacles.
No, no, no. This
miserable gruel.
Sleep. Sleep, th-that's
what I need.
Burr. Oh, ho, uh, wee.
Beastly wind.
Must have forgotten to
lock the cellar door.
Hear, h-hear, what
nonsense is this?
Oh! Don't you b-believe
in knocking?
Would you have unbolted the door
to let me enter, Ebeneezer?
That door was bolted. Wh-who.
Who are you?
In life I was your
partner, Jacob Marley.
Still, you must admit
that you see me.
You might be nothing more than
that, sour gruel I ate at supper.
Ohh-aa-haa! Mercy,
dreadful apparition.
Yes, yes, yes, I-I believe in you.
I do.
But, why do you walk the earth?
And, and why are you here?
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
You are bound with chains.
Tell me why?
I wear the chain I
forged in life.
Do you know the weight
and the length of the
More captive bound
and double-lined.
Not to know that
no space of regret
can make amends for one
slight opportunity misused.
Look, this is the
fate that awaits you.
that you still have a
chance of escaping my fate.
You must expect the visits
of three more ghosts.
Expect the first tonight
when the bell tolls one.
Well, couldn't I take 'em all at
once and have it over, Jacob?
Of course, must have dozed
off for a few hours.
Huh, had a nightmare,
yea..tee-dum.
Oh, can't a man sleep?
What, what.
I am the ghost of
Christmas present.
Look upon me. You have never
seen the like of me before.
Well, I'm not sure I see
the like of you now.
You're the one who's
too tight with a penny
to buy himself a
pair of spectacles!
Come. Come and know
me better, man.
Are you the Spirit, Sir, who's
coming was foretold to me?
Have you visited this
dwelling, before?
No, no, no, no. I'm
certain that I haven't.
Know you not the family of the
man who has slaved for you
from dawn to dark
these many years?
I pay Cratchit a wage
of but 15 bob a week!
Their happiness lies in something
apparently quite foreign to you.
What is keeping your father
and your brother, Tiny Tim?
Why bless you heart, my
dear, how late you are.
He told me coming home that
he hoped the people saw him
in church because
he was a cripple.
And it might be pleasant to let
them remember upon Christmas Day
who made lame beggars
walk and blind men see.

A very Merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.
What's wrong with that boy?
The tiny one?
I see vacant seat in the chimney corner
and a crutch, tenderly preserved.
If these shadows remain unaltered by
the future,... the child will die.
What then? If he'd like
to die, he'd better do it
and decrease the
surplus population.
It was past two
when I went to bed.
An icicle must have
gotten into the works.
I am the ghost of
Christmas past.
Well, I'm much obliged. A
good night of unbroken rest.
I-is what I need. I-If
you're so concerned.
Oh, ho, humbug, forcing a-a
fellow to leave his bed.
In the middle of
the night and...
Not a decent stitch of clothing
to warm these old bones.
But I am a mortal
and liable to fall.
Touch my hand and you
shall be upheld.
Good heavens. Why, I was
a, I was a boy here.
Remember it? I could
walk it blindfolded.

A Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Doolittle.
Come. These are but shadows
of things that have been.
Eh, t-t-the child is,
is young Ebeneezer Scrooge!
You see he is left
here, all alone.

Why it's old Fezziwig, bless his heart.

Heh, heh, heh, heh. Yo-ho, there.
Ebeneezer, Dick!

Oh, Dick Wilkins, to be sure.
Bless me, yes.
He was very much attached
to me, was Dick.
Yo-ho, my boys. No
more work tonight.
Christmas Eve, Dick.
Christmas, Ebeneezer.
Heh, heh. Clear away my lads, and
let's have lots of room here.
Huh, b-b-but she won't

Did you see? She chose me.
Beautiful little Belle.

A small matter to make these
silly folk so full of gratitude.
Small? It is impossible
to count it up in money.
The happiness he gave us is-is quite as
great as if  it cost a fortune.
It matters little.
To you, very little.
There's nothing on which it
is so hard as-as poverty.
Nothing which it condemns so
much as the pursuit of wealth.
Oh, I have watched
the change in you.
I have seen your noble
ideals fall off one by one
until... nothing matters
to you but gold.
True! I-I have grown
so much wiser.
I am going to release
you, Ebeneezer.
Tell me truthfully. If
you were free,... now,
would you choose a girl whose
father left so little money?
Was it so long ago?
That sleigh ride,
the warm glow of happiness
when you asked me?
It was snowing. But
we didn't notice.

Spirit, I cannot

Am, am I in the presence of the
ghost of Christmas yet to come?
You are about to show me shadows
of things that will happen
Ghost of the future. I fear you
more than any specter I have seen.
Well, James. A-Good morning, Brady.
Morning Billings.
No, I don't know much
about it either way.
-
-
He hasn't left it to me.
That's all I know.
Well, it's likely to
be a cheap funeral.
Upon my word, I don't know
anybody who'll go to it.
I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,
but I must be fed if I do.
Spirit, what connection do these
people have with my future?
Jacob Marley's death was
in the past, and...
I-I'm always here at
this hour of the day.
Well! The char woman, the
laundress and the undertaker.
What poor stiff have
you robbed, now?
Not so poor that I shouldn't
get a handsome price.
Bed curtains, huh? You
don't mean to say you took
'em down rings and all
with him lyin' there?
Why not? Who should care
for the likes of him?
I got his boots

Oh, please, kind Spirit,
let me see some tenderness
I... I had something to
see to on my way home.
I-It does my heart good to
see how green a place it is.
But you'll see it often.
I-I had promised you that
Tears cannot bring
Tiny Tim back to us.
Tiny Tim! Ho-ho, no.
Oh, no, not Tiny Tim!
Sleep peacefully,...
my little love.
Spirit, could I not have done something,
so that Tiny Tim might still live?
Oh, Spirit, Spirit,
show me my future self.
B-Be, before I look,
tell me please.
Are these the shadows of
the things that will be,
or are they shadows of the
things that might be?
No. No, Spirit. No. I will
honor Christmas in my heart
a-and try to keep
it all the year!
And-and I will not
shut out the lessons
Oh, tell me that I may sponge
away the writing on the stone.
Please, Spirit, please.
I beg of you.
Give me, give me some sign
that I may be saved from this.
Spirit, Spirit, don't leave me here alone.
Oh, I'm afraid.

Oh, no, no. Please, Spirit, please.
Don't leave me here alone.
Oh, they are not torn
down, rings and all.
The shadows of things that would
have been may be dispelled.
Oh, Jacob Marley, Heaven-in-the-
Christmas-Time be praised for this.
I'm as happy as an angel, and I
am as merry as a school boy.
Ha, ha, a Merry
Christmas to everybody.
Eh, ha, a happy New
Year to all the world.
I don't know how long I have
been among the spirits.
Oh, yes indeed. A
pleasant fellow.
Hello, there! Hee, hee,
hee, what's today?
Ha, what's today,
my fine fellow?
Whoop! Oh, it's Christmas
Day, and I haven't missed it.
The spirits have done
it all in one night.
Oh, do you hear? The spirits
have done it all in one night.
Eh, tell me, do you
know the poultry
shop in the next
street, at the corner?
An intelligent boy.
A remarkable boy.
Do you know whether they've sold that
prize turkey that was hanging up there?
-
-
I am in earnest. You
go and buy it, and
Come back with them in less
than five minutes, my boy,
and I'll give you half a crown.
Hee, hee, hee.
Ho, ho, ho. A fine boy.
A clever boy.
Hee, hee. I'll send it to Bob Cratchit.
He shan't know who sent it.
It's twice the size
of Tiny Tim, Ha ha.
God heavens, they'll
need to be paid.

Going outside like this
on Christmas morning.
Lock me up for a looney, they
will, I said, yes, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, there now! Oh, that's
better, yes, ha, ha.
Yes, Merry, Merry Christmas.
Well,  yes,
Why, it's impossible to
carry that to Camden Town.
Now, for the turkey, for the
cab, and for you, my boy,
an extra bonus for
a brilliant lad.
Take it to Bob Cratchit,
at 21 Crovny Lane,
and, mind you, don't
say who sent it.
It's a wonderful knocker. I shall
love it as long as I live.
Ah-ha, hello there.
Merry Christmas.
A Merry Christmas to you. Hello, there.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, so sorry, old man.
Clumsy of me.
Oh, not at all. It's
my fault entirely.
-
-
Eh, ahem, we were in
your office last evening.
Yes, I am. Allow me
to ask your pardon.
Oh, if you please, and
not a farthing less.
Say nothing, then. No. Thank you.
Much obliged.
A Merry Christmas, to you.
A Merry Christmas.
I'll give you Mr. Scrooge.
The founder of the feast.
The founder of the feast, indeed!
I wish I had him here!
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon!
Well, I'll drink his health for your
sake and the day's. Not for his.
Long life to him. A Merry Christmas
to him... and a happy New Year.
Come now, it's Christmas.
Will we not do justice
to the this day and to
this delightful bird.
Oh, such
a beautiful bird.
The biggest turkey
I've ever seen!
More likely some poor beggar
who smelled our turkey.
What are you doing at home
when you should be working?
But-but, Sir. It's
Christmas Day.
Now, I'll tell you
what, my friend,
I am not going to stand for
this sort of thing any longer.
I'm about to... to
raise your salary.
A Merry Christmas, Bob. A merrier
Christmas, my good fellow,
than I have given you
for many a year.
Yes, that's what I'll do.
I'll raise your salary
and assist your, your
struggling family.
