Ladies and gentlemen,
you've just witnessed
the closing of the Palace Theatre
and the people on the bill
have delegated my dad
to speak for all of us.
Thanks, son.
Well, folks, I...I really don't think
there's much that I can say, I'm...
But I do know that most of you out there
feel just as badly about
the closing of this place as...as we do.
And of course...of course you know
it only means one thing.
It means...it means the end of vaudeville.
I...I had a big speech
all prepared for this tonight but I...
I don't know, er...
I'm sure you all know
what my dad was about to say.
Laughter's been a habit
in this country for a good many years,
and I think it's here to stay.
I'm sure it's here to stay when you see
such friends as...Miss Sophie Tucker.
And another old friend, Mr Ted Lewis.
Let me have your hat, Tony.
Hey, wait a minute, Ted.
Things are tough enough already.
Is everybody happy?
Gee, thanks, folks. You know,
it's a pleasure to be here.
I've been here so many times before.
And what stars lit these footlights!
Right there, Nora Bayes,
Fanny Brice, Will Rogers.
So great that vaudeville audiences
doubled the gate
until Ziegfeld took them away.
And those stars keep on shining
They'll never die
They're right here beside me
Like you and I
And they're saying
Good night
Palace nights
And the fame of a name up in lights
None forgot
And it means a lot
On this wonderful night of nights
Good night
No, no, no, not goodbye
Who's ashamed of a tear in your eye?
Their memories live on
Although this may be gone
So long now, old pals
Good night
Good night
- So long, Nick.
- So long.
Louie, you know anybody
who wants to buy Indian clubs?
- I don't know any Indians.
- Oooh.
It's jokes like that that closed this theatre.
- I'll be right up, Pops.
- All right, son.
- Hey, West, you're closing tonight.
- Didn't go very well, did we?
You said it, brother. I've seen acts
lay an egg but yours is an omelette.
Look, baby, you got nothing to worry
about. I can still use you.
Oh, I'm not interested, Mr Loomis.
- Wait a minute, I wanna tell you something.
- Let her alone.
Ow!
and that's the first time I've ever been fired.
Oh, Forget about it, Dad.
This isn't show business.
- Louie!
- Ho, Louie.
Where'd you come from?
How'd you find us?
Fifi picked up your trail on 46th Street.
From there on, it was easy.
She can smell ham a mile away.
Well, how have things been going?
- Oh, pretty good.
- We'll settle for pretty good.
- Think I could I get a job here?
- Not unless Fifi puts on tights.
I got to find something pretty soon
or get out of the business.
- That goes for us too.
- We're out of it now. Only we don't know it.
I still think we oughta go to Hollywood.
I wish you and Kitty'd go with me.
How many times do I have to tell you you'll
never get me in that canned entertainment?
They were after me to sign Fifi.
I told 'em where to get off.
- Fifi stays in the legitimate theatre.
- She'll soon have it all to herself.
Dad, I wish you wouldn't be
so pig-headed.
We've hit bottom, and the only thing
we haven't tried is pictures.
And as far as I'm concerned,
it's California here I come.
Places, please.
Hold it. Hold it.
- It just doesn't come off.
- I thought It looked pretty good.
- What's the matter, Frank?
- There's something wrong with the number.
- It's exactly how we rehearsed it.
- But I still think it misses somehow.
Let's sit down and talk about it.
Mm-hm.
- Eddie, call lunch.
- All right, that will be lunch, everybody.
Back in these same places in one hour.
Hello, Jack? Tony West.
Tony West.
No, I can't make it tonight.
Yeah, we're having a little trouble on the set.
They're trying to make Gloria Vance
a rhythm dancer in one easy lesson.
What?
Can't you just see me barging in
and telling them what to do?
No, not me.
Look, Jack, they hired me
to hoof in the background
and that's all they're gonna get.
Sure, I could straighten her out in 20
minutes but why should I stick my chin out?
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.
I got to go and grab some lunch. So long.
- Wait a minute.
- Me?
Yes, you.
I couldn't help
overhearing your telephone conversation.
Sorry, I didn't think I was talking so loud.
It was very interesting.
I'd like to hear some more.
Well, Miss Vance, I seen all your pictures
and I like them.
- You're good.
- Thank you.
But not half as good as you could be.
Perhaps I'm a little dull
but I don't quite understand.
Ballet dancing is an art,
and when you combine it with rhythm,
that's something else.
Well, what would you suggest?
I have some definite ideas
along those lines.
- I'd like to hear them some time.
- Don't worry, you will.
Very funny.
Come in.
Miss Vance, I didn't want to go
too far in front of Mr Taylor.
- After all, he's the director.
- You barge in here like this?
You wanted to hear my idea.
- It'll just take a minute.
- That'll be too long.
There's something
I gotta tell you. Listen to me.
My name was on Broadway
when you were Bertha Lindqvist,
the broad in the silverware ads.
- Dancing's my business.
- You all right, Miss Vance?
I will be, as soon as
you remove this crackpot.
- OK, bud, let's go.
- I guess it is getting crowded in here.
I'll see you when we can have some privacy.
That must be Dr Henderson.
- Hello, Jim, darling.
- Jim?
- Tony's the name. Remember me?
- Why, yes, I...
- Now, really, Mr...
- West. Tony West.
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I am.
Lucky I dropped in before you left.
Mind if we sit down?
Not at all. Too bad you couldn't
make it in time for dinner.
Oh, thanks just the same.
About that routine today,
nothing was wrong with you.
- You know what was the matter?
- No.
You need a dancing partner.
Are you by any chance suggesting yourself?
Frankly, I'm leading up to it.
- You have no inhibitions, have you?
- I can't afford them.
Listen, Miss Vance,
I've been a dancer all my life...
Excuse me, Miss Vance,
Dr Henderson is calling.
Thank you, Annie.
You will excuse me, won't you?
No hurry.
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, darling.
I know what you're going to say
but I just got an emergency call
to get down to the hospital.
If you'll give me another date tomorrow,
I won't allow anything to interfere.
Unless I get another emergency call.
All right, darling. See you tomorrow. Bye.
Annie, I won't need this.
- You're not going out?
- No.
There's a better show in the living room.
I'm about to stick
a pin into a balloon.
Let's see, you had suggested
yourself as my partner.
That's right.
Supposing I agreed it was practical,
there's more to a picture than just dancing.
Well, I've considered that too.
You've considered everything, haven't you?
Just about.
- Let's try a scene, shall we?
- Swell.
- Here's a script.
- How about the one you did this morning?
- The love scene?
- Why not?
- Fine.
- I almost know it by heart.
I've watched you rehearse it 40 times.
- That's a slight exaggeration.
- Well, eight by actual count.
We'll take it from page 38.
Colette and Steve are snowbound
in his mountain lodge.
That's good enough for me.
Steve, were you ever in love?
Huh?
- You say, "yes".
- Oh, uh...
Yes.
Recently?
No, not recently.
Do you have a favourite type
among women?
Yeah, blondes.
I shouldn't have liked it
if you'd said brunettes.
I'm only interested in blondes.
How am I doing?
Fine.
Remember, I'm only quoting
from the script.
It's odd, isn't it?
The things that make people
find other people attractive.
A turn of the head, a way of walking...
the trick of speech.
Little things that one man
may not notice at all
can be irresistibly alluring...to another.
- Now, take voices...
- I'll take yours.
- Do you really like my voice?
- I love your voice.
- Well, go on.
- Oh.
And it's the same
all the way down the line,
hair, eyes, lips,
there's no explaining it.
A woman with the most
perfect figure in the world
may be no more attractive to you
than a marble statue,
and then some scrawny, hipless
little toothpick will come along
and fill you with mad desire.
The guy who wrote this
didn't have me in mind.
Come on.
..and fill you with mad desire.
- Not yet.
- Oh, pardon me.
I think you're the most desirable woman
in the whole world.
Steve, would you do something for me?
- Anything.
- Stick to the script.
All depends on what it is.
It's an odd request from a lady.
Glad to oblige.
Will you marry me?
- Did you ring?
- No.
Oh, I must have touched the button
by mistake.
I see you do a little writing too,
the maid's entrance isn't in here.
- Nice timing.
- I'm...
You needn't be embarrassed,
I was just leaving anyway.
I am not embarrassed.
That's what it says in the script.
And you still need a dancing partner.
But I tell you, I need a dancing partner.
And for the 20th time,
I tell you it's out of the question.
Please, Gloria,
there are a lot of people on the set.
You admit the number isn't good.
- But this man is only an extra.
- Isn't that what I was?
His name was on Broadway
before mine was Gloria Vance.
- When you were Bertha Lundqvist...
- Lindqvist.
All right, Lindqvist. Oh, be reasonable.
Go back on the set like a good girl.
- I've always cooperated with the studio.
- Oh, yes...
Worked overtime so you could
catch up on your schedule?
- Yes, but...
- You've got to do this for me.
- Yes, Gloria, I...
- Thanks, Walter.
You're a darling.
Say, you haven't by any chance
fallen for this guy, have you?
That is an understatement.
I live for tomorrow,
the sake of tomorrow tonight
- Tony.
- Hello, darling. I...tried not to awaken you.
You look so pretty asleep.
Tony, do you know what day this is?
Sure, Saturday.
- Today's our...
- ..third wedding anniversary.
I didn't forget it, honey.
I brought you a little present.
- I've got it here, if I can find it.
- From me to you.
Say, that's smart.
- That'll come in handy some day.
- It'll come in handy tomorrow.
- Here are the reservations for Mexico City.
- Mexico City?
- That's right. We're leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
I just had to do it this way.
Every time we've planned a trip, you've
thought of something to keep us here.
With all my love, baby.
Thank you.
- Oh, It's beautiful.
- Turn it around.
- That's you.
- Right. Now watch.
- Now that's clever.
- You're married to a very clever fella.
- A very wonderful fella.
- Lucky's the word.
Er, Gloria, about that trip,
I don't think I can make it.
Oh, we can. We've got two weeks off and
nothing will stop us from going this time.
Last year it was
a personal appearance tour,
the year before, instead of Sun Valley
we went skiing on stage eight.
Darling, you stay packed
and we'll leave Monday morning.
Nothing will stop us this time.
Tony, you're so wonderful,
even when you're lying.
You're even more wonderful
when you don't believe me.
You've seen them
in such pictures as Love Me Forever,
Dancing On A Moonbeam,
Love, Laughter and Music.
See Gloria Vance and Tony West
in their new extravaganza,
A Night In Brazil,
now playing at your...
We interrupt this programme for
an announcement from Washington.
The President has just announced
that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor.
Japanese planes have bombed Singapore,
Guam and the Philippine islands.
But my knee has never bothered me.
It's an old fracture
that never healed properly.
It happened when I was a kid.
I've been dancing on it ever since.
Dancing's not like
marching with a full pack.
That wouldn't stop me.
I'm in good shape.
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
Incidentally, Captain,
I'd rather nobody knew I was turned down.
- I understand.
- Thanks.
Down, boys!
It's Louie Fairweather's dog act.
No, not the dog track! Will you shut up!
Tony asked me to stop you
betting those horses.
Tell him you did. Hello, Pete.
Ali Baba in the fifth, yeah.
Ten on the nose. You got it?
Good.
Don't tell me she rang that doorbell.
Ta-da!
Chick Doyle!
- Can you beat that?
- Louie!
- Hey, you're looking swell.
- How are you?
- Is this is the city dog pound?
- It's Fairweather's new dog act.
Hollywood caught up with you?
A war picture?
That ain't so. I heard from my draft board.
- That uniform's the real McCoy?
- You can say that again.
They fished my number out of the bag first.
- I'm booked solid.
- Well, what are you doing up here?
Well, they sent me out to look
for some entertainment for the boys.
- So I hunted up you fellas.
- We're kind of out of touch.
We don't know many picture people.
You can whip up some kind of a show.
I could take my new dog act down there.
That's a good idea. And leave it there.
- What about a drink?
- A drink?
Well, you sure put us in a spot, didn't you?
- Me? It was your idea.
- It was your bottle.
Tony'll never get us out of this one.
- Hello, Dad, Louie.
- Tony.
- Uh, where's Gloria?
- Shh...she's in her room.
What's the matter?
- Who promised all this?
-  He did.
- You must've been crazy.
- No, just swacked.
You better get in touch with these stars.
Wait a minute, we don't even know 'em.
We've never met 'em.
- Why didn't you think of that before?
- If it'll make you feel any better, kick me.
It's a large order.
I don't know what to do about it.
Kick your father -
that sounded like a good idea.
Shut up, can't you see he's thinking?
I know...I know I've been a lot of trouble.
Don't worry about it, Dad,
I'll dig up a show somehow.
I told you he'd fix it.
Here comes Tony West, fellas.
Hi, Tony.
- Hey, Tony.
- Hello, Tony.
- Mr West?
- Yes.
We'll sure remember this show a long time.
- There'll be others.
- No, we're going over.
Don't you worry. Wherever there are men
in uniform, there'll be entertainment.
- Show business will come through.
- That's swell.
Members of
the Hollywood Victory Committee,
it is very gratifying to see represented here
not only the actors' but the screenwriters'
and directors' guilds,
and every other craft and union
in the entertainment industry.
We will make
a large number of training films,
and for the army we are arranging
to supply our overseas forces
with all of our best feature pictures,
many before they are even released here.
Exhibitors will use their theatres
as centres for bond sales,
salvage drives, blood donations,
Red Cross campaigns and other projects.
But all this is merely a beginning.
We are enlisting our efforts in this war
for the duration
and the job to be done is enormous.
Our War Activities Committee
and the studios will finance its costs.
and every actor will be allotted time
to carry on this work.
How the work can best be done
is the reason we are here.
Tony West will now tell us
some of the immediate requirements.
We have a wire here asking our help
in raising a million dollars
for the Army and Navy Relief.
So we need volunteers for a victory caravan
to tour the country to raise this money.
Swell.
Now, it's going to be up to us
to send the men real living entertainment,
the songs, dances and laughs
they had back home.
Our talent pool will be broken up
into hundreds of units
travelling under the auspices of
the USO camp shows
and the Special Service Division
of the armed services.
This job can't be hit or miss.
I might tell you now that this is
no plush compartment setup.
You'll be travelling in everything from planes
to jeeps to trucks and barges.
The Writers' Mobilisation Committee
is behind us
and will furnish special material
for those who require it.
However this shouldn't
delay anyone from leaving now
because you people
are familiar faces to the men in the service.
They wanna see you, talk to you,
and shake your hand.
Now, are there any questions
or suggestions?
Are these shows to be given only
by motion picture people?
On the contrary, in addition to our industry,
the entertainment world has volunteered.
What's the matter with
the Last of the Red-Hot Mamas?
I'm available next week
after my picture's finished.
What about your concert tour,
Jeanette?
I'll have it postponed.
That's the spirit.
- How about an amateur magic show?
- Great.
I'll go anywhere
as long as it's soldiers, sailors or marines.
-  Swell, Marlene.
- Is there any radio entertainment?
I'm glad you brought that up, Dinah.
In addition
to the broadcasts in this country
we'll reach the men at the front
by short wave.
These programmes are to be called
Command Performance and Mail Call.
- Count me in.
- I'll do some camp shows.
That's for me - I expect to be living in
one of those pup tents soon anyway.
You can count on me.
You'll always find me down at
Little Joe's Cream Puff Emporium
out on Swisses Street.
Bill, I know the boys'll enjoy you.
- We'd like to help too.
- How about me going overseas?
You can count on me
for anything from singin' to cookin'.
Well, I know many of you
have early calls in the morning
so I'd like to ask the volunteers
to leave their pledges with Bill Barrett.
And thanks for coming and good night.
Let's all give our committee
a rising vote of confidence.
Hollywood Victory Committee.
I'll connect you with the radio division.
The overseas division takes care of that, sir.
Hollywood Victory Committee.
Bond drives? Mr Loal.
USO camp shows, West Coast.
One moment, please.
Camp shows, New York calling, Mr Barrett.
- I'd like to see a show, Mildred.
- Why don't you join the WAACs?
- I'm 4F. I got bunions.
- Where?
- Hollywood Victory Committee?
- Here's some calls to put through, girls.
Yes, Major, a show's there
Sunday the tenth.
Shows at ten, 2:30 and four.
- That's right, sir.
- Sorry, that's a commercial venture.
We can't charge servicemen.
Maxie Rosenbloom is here now.
I have his ticket.
- There you are, Mr Rosenbloom.
- Thanks.
Gee... Which end do I start from?
Mr Philips handles film entertainment.
His unit is shooting
at Twentieth Century Fox this morning.
- I'll give him your message.
- Joan Blondell will get in on Tuesday.
She wants to go to a Pacific base.
That's right.
We're not allowed to divulge
the base you'll go to.
That makes it all the more exciting.
I solemnly swear that I will not divulge
any military secrets...
Check with MGM and see if they'll postpone
the Hedy Lamarr picture so we can use her.
RKO just OK'd Cary Grant.
We'll hear from Paramount later
on Colbert and Dick Powell.
Oh, swell.
- Check Abbott and Costello.
- Right away.
The priority on Irene Dunne
has just come through.
Fine.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
Just in case you fellas don't know me,
I'm something left over from the last war.
The old gal herself, Sophie Tucker.
Like every other Yank
my lucky stars I thank
That I can always see
the sunny side of life
Boys are marching off to camp,
sweethearts are being left behind
But I say to the girls to cheer up, girls
And keep this thought in mind
The bigger the army and the navy
- The better the lovin' will be
-
The women who went through
the last war know what I mean
We're getting thrills
we haven't had since 1918
With millions of soldiers and sailors
There's a difference, you must agree
I know perfect gentlemen,
discreet in every way
They get into a uniform
and it's bang-bang right away
The bigger the army and the navy
The better the lovin' will be
And it's gonna be perfect for me
Why, the army sure does something
to you kids in basic training
Just ask the canteen hostesses
who do the entertaining
And when a soldier gets a furlough
or a sailor comes ashore
The longer you make your kisses,
the shorter he'll make the war
As to sailors,
for them I've always had a high regard
Who wouldn't, after living three years
near the Brooklyn Navy Yard?
When a soldier says,
"What's cookin', cookie?"
He ain't talking to no chef
And if he's physically 1A,
don't you be socially 4F
Girls, we all can't be glamorous,
we all can't be exotic
I'm no longer young and beautiful
but I'm still patriotic
Knitting sweaters is not enough
and don't you think so for a minute
A sailor wants a sweater -
with a Lana Turner in it
We did our share when over there
your papas beat the Huns
And what the mamas did for the papas
the daughters can do for the sons
The bigger the army and the navy
The better the lovin' will be
And it's certainly OK with me
You've heard their records,
you've seen them in pictures,
here they are in person -
the Andrews Sisters!
Sing Bei Mir Bist Du Schön,
Hold Tight, Well All Right!
Oh, now wait a minute, fellas,
we can't do them all at once
but we'll try to do as many as we can, OK?
Do you remember...
Bei mir bist du schön
Please let me explain
Bei mir bist du schön
Means you're grand
- Well, all right!
-  Well, all right, then!
Dig-dig-dig, well, all right
- Well, all right!
-  Chop-chop-chop, well, all right
- Well, all right.
Hi-hi-hi, well, all right, well, all right,
well, all right, well, all right
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight, frrrrr yaka taka,
want some seafood, mama
And now here's the marching song
of the United Nations.
Roll out the barrel
Sing out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel
Cos the gang's all here
He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style
that no one else could play
He's in the army now and blowing reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy
of Company B
Hey, you - you with the letter.
Here's a message
you can send home to your gal.
I'll be with you
In apple blossom time
I'll be with you
To change your name to mine
I'm from the SS Pennsylvania!
Sing a song for me!
Strike up the music, the band has begun
The Pennsylvania Polka
Everybody has the mania
To do the polka from Pennsylvania
She hates corny waltzes
and she hates the gavotte
But there's one big advantage
if the music is hot
It's a fast-moving exit
just in case something...
- Wow!
-
There's gonna be a hallelujah day
When the boys
have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play
We'll be dancing the victory polka
And they'll come
marching down Fifth Avenue
The United Nations in review
When this lovely dream has all come true
We'll be dancing the victory polka
We'll be dancing the victory polka
Mark up another camp show
for Martha Raye,
and put up a flag for Jimmy Stewart -
he's in the service.
Joe E Brown left for
the south Pacific this morning.
Put up an eagle for Joe.
- Did you want me?
- Yes, Tony.
- We need a show for Camp Stewart.
- This is a bad time.
Everybody's out on the bond tour.
Let's see who's available in your unit.
How about Joan Blondell?
Tony, Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan
want to see you this afternoon.
- Hello, Mr West.
- Hello, Donald. Hello, Peggy.
- What can I do for you?
- We'd like to do some shows.
- That's swell.
- Look, I wrote a little number...
What do you mean, you wrote it?
We pitched in and bought a little number.
- You think you could use us?
- Can I? There it is, take your pick.
- No, there!
- Stop that.
We'll go there then.
Hello, fellas, my name is Donald O'Connor.
Now we'll pause for you to
look at each other and say, "So what?"
You've all heard Charlie Spivak
And His Orchestra.
They tell me Charlie plays a sweet trumpet -
I wouldn't know, I've never tasted it.
But the person I really want you to meet
is a quiet, demure little girl.
Miss Peggy Ryan.
-  So you're a solid sender
- Uh-huh
Off on a four and a two-beat bender
Yeah, I'm in the groove, on the beam
And Beat Me Daddy
is my favourite theme
So you've just discovered gate talk...
Just...
Well, listen, gal, to me
They called me Jackson
on the day I was born
Here is my history
Papa was a tom cat
Well, my mommy was a hep cat
- I'm their pride and joy...
- They call me floy-doy
I'm a kitten with my mittens laced
But I can dig the boogie
And it's murder when I woogie
I give the brush but quick to rickety-tick
I'm a kitten with my mittens laced
I even used up eight of my nine lives
Yeah? Well, if you had any sense
Instead of gallivantin', diggin', plantin'
at those dives
You'd be miaowin' on the back yard fence
But when the band is rockin'
And old drummer man is talkin'
Oh, brother, I can't stop
from blowin' my top
I'm a cat whose spats are groovy
Ow!
My mommy told me everything
a little cat should know
About the jam and the jive
My mom would lullaby me,
pacify me, soft and low
Sing it, Mr Five by Five
So listen all you 'gators
All you knocked-out syncopators
Have you got it straight?
Up to date
It ain't no use to try to change our fate
For in the book it's written
We will both be killer-diller kittens
with our mittens laced
Meow!
- Telegram, Mr West.
- Thanks.
Now I'd like to present a lady
who needs no introduction.
She has the most beautiful voice,
not in this world but out of this world.
- Miss Jeanette MacDonald.
- You owe me two bucks, Bob.
Blow, whistle
Blow away
Blow away the past
Go, engine
Anywhere
I don't care how fast
On, on, from darkness into dawn
From rain into the rainbow, fly with me
Gone, gone, all my grief and woe
What matter where I go
If I am free
Beyond the blue horizon
Waits a beautiful day
Goodbye to things that bore me
Joy is waiting for me
I see a new horizon
My life has only begun
Beyond the blue horizon
Lies a shining sun
Beyond the blue horizon
Waits a beautiful day
Goodbye to things that bore me
Joy is waiting for me
I see a new horizon
My life has only begun
Beyond the blue horizon
Lies a shining
Sun
Western Union? Oh...
Read it.
Dear Tony, I've some great news. Stop.
Can't send it by wire. Stop.
What?
- With love, Gloria.
- Darling, I'm trying to listen.
Could you read that again, please?
There are gonna be
some changes around here.
Yes, on the 15th. Yes, I got that.
I figured it all out driving home.
We'll knock out the west wall
and build a nursery.
OK, thanks. Gloria, you're just in time
to become a charter member
of the Hollywood Victory Committee.
Wait till you hear our plans.
Take this. You'll need it
when you hear what I have to say.
I can't stop now, darling.
Incidentally, you're on the executive board.
- But I can't, Tony.
- Sure you can. Don't worry about the studio.
Bruce has arranged to give us time off.
There's nothing to tie us down.
- But there is.
- We'll talk about it later.
Meet me at the Beverly Wilshire
tonight at eight.
I'm sorry, honey.
You had something to tell me.
What's the big news?
You've already put it on the back page.
We'll try and talk when you get back,
and I don't think they'd better
count on me for this work.
Forget the temperament.
Temperament? Don't you ever think
about anybody but yourself?
If I don't agree, it's temperament.
I'll talk to you later. Meet me tonight
at the Beverly Wilshire at eight.
Just like that, you wind
the doll and she dances.
Be reasonable, honey.
I promised you'd be there.
You promised! If I don't show up,
it will embarrass the great Tony West.
If it were a vacation to Sun Valley,
you'd jump at it.
When I hear you talk,
Sun Valley isn't far enough.
Go any place you want but you be
at that meeting or I won't be back here.
Is that an ultimatum?
Yes it is and I'm tired of talking about it.
Instead of talking so much,
why don't you get into a uniform?
Ridiculous, a father ought to hear
that he's gonna be a father
even if he won't take time to hear it.
I'm gonna get him on the telephone.
He'll take time to listen to me, all right.
Annie, please, I don't want you to call him.
Yes, ma'am.
- That was a swell meeting tonight.
- You columnists can be a great help, too.
- You can count on us 100%.
- I was sure of that.
Oh, Tony, I missed Gloria tonight.
- Oh... She had an early call.
- Early call? She's between pictures.
Well...she's been pretty busy lately.
- I see. Well, good night.
- Good night.
- Did you find him?
- He wasn't at the club.
Well, try the studio again.
Never mind, Annie.
If Mr West should happen to call,
tell him I'm not in.
Yes, ma'am.
- Hollywood Victory Committee.
- Hollywood Victory Committee.
Yes, Mr West,
I have a call in for Orson Welles.
Just a minute. Here's Camp Scott.
Go ahead, Mr West.
Hello? Who?
Orson Welles. Just a moment.
Mr Welles, telephone!
- How do you work this thing?
- The other end.
Hello, Orson.
How's the weather down there?
I'm sorry, I can't give you that information.
That's a civilian secret.
How about moving your show
over to Camp Howard tomorrow?
Swell.
Thanks a million.
Orson Welles, Camp Howard tomorrow.
That's the first time you ever saw
a rabbit take a magician out of a hat.
Oh, yardbird.
Uh-oh.
Your kind indulgence.
A miracle of the ancient East.
For our next experiment,
we want two able-bodied,
open-minded,
clean-living young gentlemen
to assist us in sawing
Marlene Dietrich in half.
In the regulation method of sawing
the woman in half, the subject is...
- What is your name, sir? Meet Marlene.
- Fred.
..the subject is generally placed...
You don't have to make
anything special of it.
..in a wooden box for concealment.
We, however, do it the hard way.
Our torture chamber has been abbreviated.
Achmed, the wooden rompers.
Just try that on for size, Marlene.
My next selection.
Orson?
Mm-hm?
- We haven't rehearsed this.
- I'm sorry.
This is one trick you can't repeat.
Gentlemen, you ought to know
we lose a girl at every performance.
The turnover is tremendous.
You take this end, sir.
You take that end. Be very careful.
You might cut your fingers.
Now, the idea is
to just...saw Miss Dietrich in half.
Da-da-di, da-da-dum
- Wait a minute, boys. Orson?
- Mm-hm?
- How does the trick work?
- Just wait. This'll kill you.
Go right ahead, gentlemen.
Da-da-di, da-da-dum
Da-da-di, da-da-dum
Da-da-di, da-da-do-do-do
Calling Dr Kildare!
Calling Dr Kildare!
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Tempo, gentlemen! Pick up your tempo!
La-la-la, di-di-di-di
She breathes! She stirs!
She seems to feel
a little saw across her keel.
Marlene!
It tickles!
Timber!
-
-
- Oh, Orson.
- Yes, Marlene.
I feel just the same as always.
Wait till you try to take a bow.
An announcement.
If you run into the Dietrich legs,
please ask them both
to come back to the tent.
They're wearing Marlene's
last pair of nylon stockings.
- Orson.
- Hmm...
- How do I know these are my legs?
- Have no fear.
I will hypnotise her and she'll know.
Look me in the yolks of the eyes.
Hiya, Tony.
Did you send that script
to Charlie's house?
I delivered it to him personally.
I'm no fool.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Tony, I know I'm only your sister
but when you married Gloria,
we sort of counted her in the family...
Forget it, Kitty.
I know you're not happy about
this separation and I'm sure she isn't.
- Why don't you call her?
- If Gloria wanted to hear from me...
Stop being stubborn. Call her up.
All right, Kitty. You win.
What do you mean I win?
You know you're glad I asked you to.
- Go on. Get out.
-
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. West.
No, she is not in.
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
She won't talk to you.
She's given me strict orders.
I'm sorry, sir. Goodbye.
There's one guy
I always know where to find.
- Hello, Walter.
- I'm going to dinner. Want to join me?
Sorry, I can't make it.
Got to be at a broadcast tonight.
- It's a Command Performance.
- When will we get together?
I've a lot of things to talk to you about.
I'm going out on a camp tour.
I won't be back for eight to ten weeks.
Well, drop me a line.
I'll see you when you get back.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Thank you and hiya, fellas,
this is Dinah Shore.
We dreamed up
another 4-0 Command Performance
and before they pry me loose
from the microphone,
I'm sending love to the Silver Dollar
gun crew at Dutch Harbor,
to Memphis Bill and his Seabees
in the South Pacific
and, by the way, I got myself quite
a case on those engineers down there,
where the skeeters buzz and chiggers chug.
Ditto to those leathernecks
and double ditto to all the rangers.
That's about enough of words
without music, so here I go.
They call, no date
I promised you I'd wait
I want them all to know
I'm strictly single, oh
I'll walk alone
Because, to tell you the truth
I'll be lonely
I don't mind being lonely
When my heart tells me you are lonely too
I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why
And I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
Dreams we fashioned the night
You held me tight
I'll always be near you
Wherever you are
Each night and every prayer
Just whisper I'll hear you
No matter how far
So close your eyes
And I'll be there
Please walk alone
But send your love
and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me
I'll walk alone
Darling, all by myself
I'll walk alone
We now take pleasure in introducing
that eminent pianist Artur Rubinstein.
Hi, boys.
Hey, what's going on in here?
We just want to dance with Martha.
Take it easy, boys, take it easy.
Line up over here.
Hey, turn up that radio, Corporal.
I'll get by
As long as I have you
Though there be rain
And darkness too
I'll not complain
I'll see it through
And, darling, though you may
Be far away
That's true
But what care I?
Say, I'll get by
As long as I
Have you
- Mr West? I'm Lieutenant Reynolds.
- Hi, Lieutenant. What can I do for you?
Well, sir, I have a small detail of men
stationed up above Lone Ridge.
It gets monotonous.
Those boys are hungry for entertainment.
I was wondering
if you could bring a show up some time.
It certainly would give those fellas a lift.
They're a pretty tired bunch.
I think we can make it. Mr Jordan,
do you know Lieutenant Reynolds?
- Hiya.
- Hiya, Mr Jordan.
- How about it, Louis?
- It's OK with me.
- You mean now?
- Why not?
- Gosh, this is more than I'd expected.
- Come on.
I have a truck outside.
- Here comes Mr Jordan.
Men, I've got a little...
No, this is a big surprise.
Louis Jordan and his band.
I got a girl who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love her
Yes, I love her
I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
cos I want her
I'm gonna ask her
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're acting lately
makes me doubt
Youse is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in
your heart's done gone out
A woman is a creature
that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one,
you find she's gone and made a change
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true?
Thank you very much, Louis Jordan.
And now the man who's responsible for
this fine entertainment, Mr Tony West.
Let's give him a great big hand.
Come on, fellas.
Thank you very much.
Hiya, fellas. I want you to know
I'm very happy to be here.
We know that there are many small
isolated units throughout the country
and we're not forgetting them.
Our organisation is growing fast
and as soon as we...
How about a dance?
If you guys can take it, I can.
How about it, Louis?
I...I'd like to introduce to you a man of spirit.
A man who claims to be a bottle baby.
Mr WC Fields!
Give me my books and my bottle
Hoo-ee-hoo, hoo-ee-hoo
Give me my...
Um...
Hmm...
That looks slightly warped.
Must have been standing near the fireplace.
Hoo-ee-hoo, hoo-ee-hoo,
hoo-ee-hoo
Hoo-ee-hoo
Ahh. That's better. Much better.
Guess that's a little warped too.
They'll never make this joint pay.
Now it'll go.
The joint's haunted.
Ugh...
This is what they call a massage shot.
Massage, taken from the French.
An old French word.
My grandmother used to use the word.
What's going on here?
Well...
What do you think of that?
They don't build billiard tables today
like they used to do in Grandfather's day.
Fore!
Ball boy, er... caddie, er...
Throw me a ball, somebody.
No coordination around here whatever.
Somebody throw me a ball, will you?
One of those kitchen gendarmes.
Must be one of those new secret weapons.
I come here and try
to please you boys and...
get some smart aleck out there...
Well, that'll get that off my lip.
Come on! Make up your mind!
- What is it, Annie?
- Miss West is here to see you.
Oh.
Have her come in.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Gloria.
Do tell me all about yourself
and Dad and Louie.
We're all fine. We've missed you terribly.
- We've been busy working army camps.
- Yes, I know.
It's wonderful. Like being back in vaudeville.
Dad and Louie are in their glory.
- It must be grand for them.
- It's grand for all of us, Gloria.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I know you want to do something to help.
It's just too bad that you and Tony got
started on the wrong foot somehow.
That happens sometimes.
But we've got to pocket our
personal feelings and do whatever we can.
We've gotten so many letters
from soldiers who want to see you.
People are talking. I want to tell them
how wrong they are about you.
I'm afraid you can't, Kitty, for a while.
Gloria, how long are you going to live
in this special little world of yours?
Not for very long, darling.
Kitty...will you give me
your word of honour about something?
Of course.
I want you to promise not to tell anybody.
Certainly. What is it?
I really hadn't planned to tell you, Kitty,
but I rather think somebody
in the family ought to know.
- It's so difficult to...
- For heaven's sakes!
Why do people have to beat around
the bush about having a baby?
A baby!
- Gloria, that's wonderful.
- Isn't it?
Dr Wood has a lovely cottage up
in Sunland. I'll be going there soon.
The idea of hiding out.
If you were me, I'd be so proud,
I'd shout it in the streets.
Gloria, why don't you tell Tony?
It'd make all the difference in the world.
That's just it.
You see, I love Tony but if he wants
to come back it's got to be for me.
In celebration of Independence Day, you will
hear from our Soldiers In Grease Paint,
entertaining in almost
every corner of the globe.
But first we are honoured to bring you
Colonel Edward Dodds
of the Special Service Division of
the United States Army- Colonel Dodds.
Since the organisation of
the USO camp shows in October 1941,
millions of men in the armed services
have been privileged to see
and hear you entertainers.
You've travelled to
the far corners of the earth
for the sole purpose of bringing joy to the
hearts of our men.
It is my pleasure to extend to all of you
the thanks of every man and woman
who wears the uniform of
our country and of our allies.
Now I would like to turn
the microphone over to a man
who has entertained thousands of the boys,
an organiser of camp shows and the
Hollywood Victory Committee, Tony West.
Thank you, Colonel Dodds.
On behalf of the entertainment industry,
I would like to throw a handful
of credit where credit is due.
Our shows would not be possible
without the generous cooperation
of the Special Service Division
of the United States Army
and Navy Departments.
And now to Marine Base Hospital
with Carmen Amaya.
Come in, England.
- Goodbye.
- Miss MacDonald.
The boys inside have had a tough time.
If you'd come in for a minute,
it might cheer them up.
Of course. I'd love to.
Dave, let's give them Dreams.
Fine. Hey, fellas, unwrap 'em.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jeanette.
- What would you like?
- I'd like to see my girl.
Me too.
- Me too.
- I'll bet you would.
Let me see.
Suppose you close your eyes
and think about her
and maybe I can bring her to you,
shall I try?
- That'd be swell.
- All right.
I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Once again you'll be in my arms
Thrill me with your wonderful charms
Lips that cling to mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams
I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Once again you'll be in my arms
Thrill me with your wonderful charms
Lips that cling to mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light
My way tonight
I'll see you
In my
Dreams
Now, as a climax to our programme,
we bring you the Delta Rhythm Boys,
who will sing a number,
especially befitting this Independence Day.
The house I live in, a plot of earth
The street, the grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races, all religions
That's America to me
The place I work in, the worker at my side
The little town or city
where my people lived and died
The howdy and the handshake
The air of feeling free
The right to speak my mind out
That's America to me
The things I see about me,
the big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
and the house a mile tall
The wedding and the churchyard
The laughter and the tears
The dream that's been
a-growing for 150 years
The town I live in
The street, the house, the room
The pavement of the city,
or a garden all in bloom
The church, the school, the clubhouse,
the million lives I see
But especially the people
That's America to me
The words of old Abe Lincoln
Of Jefferson and Paine
Of Washington and Jackson
And the tasks that still remain
The little bridge at Concord
where freedom's fight began
At Gettysburg and Midway
and the story of Bataan
The house I live in,
the goodness everywhere
A land of wealth and beauty
with enough for all to share
Our house that we call freedom
The home of liberty
And a promise for tomorrow
That's America
To me
Thanks to the Hollywood Victory Committee
which made possible
the appearance of the stars
and also our gratitude to the United
Theatrical War Activities Committee.
And to you, Tony West.
Bon voyage and the best of luck
on your trip overseas.
This is Tom Hanlon speaking.
- Hello, Gloria.
- Walter.
- Did Annie tell you?
- Annie?
She wouldn't tell her own mother
the time of day if you ordered her not to.
Now I know what the FBI go through.
- How's Tony?
- I haven't seen much of him.
Nobody does
except the people he works with.
He eats, sleeps and dreams camp shows.
So I've heard.
I understand he's going overseas.
That's what he's been after
ever since the Army rejected him.
Since what?
Why, yes. He tried to enlist
the day after Pearl Harbor.
- I didn't know that.
- Gloria...
Do you think it's fair to keep this a secret?
Where can I reach him?
You might call Bill Barrett
at the Hollywood Victory Committee.
Hello? Hello, Mrs West. How are you?
I'm sorry but Mr West
has just left for overseas.
Kids, I got the lowdown. We land tomorrow,
Australia, Brisbane. Are you packed?
- I am.
- Well, I'm not.
Would you mind throwing
my things in a bag?
Sure.
- Still feeling kinda low, eh, Tony?
- Kinda.
I have a hunch
that all your moping's for nothing.
I ran out of hunches
when she didn't say goodbye.
There might be a good reason.
I ran out of reasons too.
You're still in love with Gloria, aren't you?
I guess it doesn't make
much difference now.
Tony, I'm gonna do something
I haven't done since the fourth grade.
I'm gonna tell a tale out of school.
I made a promise to Gloria
that I'm gonna have to break.
What is it?
She didn't come to the boat because
she's at Dr Wood's place in Sunland.
Doc Wood? The baby doctor?
Why didn't she tell me?
She hoped you'd come back because
you wanted to, not because of the baby.
Of course I wanted to.
What did she think?
- She wasn't sure.
- She will be soon. I'll cable her.
No. I'll call her from Brisbane tomorrow.
Shoo-shoo-shoo, baby
Shoo-shoo-shoo, baby
Bye-bye-bye, baby
Doo-da, do-day,
your papa's off to the seven seas
Don't cry, baby
Don't sigh, baby
Bye-bye-bye, baby
Doo-da, doo-day,
when I come back we'll live a life of ease
Seems kind of tough now
to say goodbye this way
Her father's gotta be rough now so that
he can be sweet to you another day
Bye-bye-bye, baby
Don't cry, baby
Shoo-shoo-shoo, baby
Doo-da, doo-day
Kitty!
Dad, you look after the girls.
Hey, Tony! Where are you going?
I'm going to try and find Louie!
Fifi.
Louie!
- You want me, Mac?
- Yeah, get your stuff.
They got a cargo ship last night
with a camp show unit aboard.
I've arranged for you two
to go with the search party.
All right.
Hold it!
- Mr West?
- Yes. Any news about my son?
- Not yet.
- They're still searching.
They're waiting for you at the USO house.
Yes, I heard it on the radio this morning.
Does Mrs West know about it?
No. I don't think it wise to tell her yet.
Nurse, no newspapers.
Yes, Doctor.
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Gloria. Are you feeling all right?
Fine. What do you think of my son?
I expect him to break into his dance
any minute, just like Tony.
Any word from him?
He's supposed to arrive in Brisbane tonight.
Australia. It seems so far away.
And yet somehow I feel terribly close to him.
More so today than ever.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello, Gloria.
- How are you?
- I'm all right.
But how's the baby?
They tell me he's quite a boy.
Yes, he's fine.
But that isn't what I came
to talk to you about.
This is the overseas symbol, isn't it?
I'd like to go over as soon as possible.
At this moment I'm playing
in a tin hut somewhere in Alaska,
a camp in Australia, a makeshift theatre
in the Caribbean, or North Africa.
I'm in Italy, the Solomons,
in Ireland and England and Iceland,
then this is my contribution
to America at war.
I am a Soldier In Grease Paint,
serving a free country
This service is the actor's
imperishable memorial.
So just keep hummin',
a better day is comin'
A better day is comin', wait and see
There'll be laughter and joy forever after
Joy for everyone and love for me
The drums are drummin',
a better day is comin'
A better day is comin', yes, sirree
So where's that spirit?
Come on, let's hear it
Hooray! Hooray!
A better day is comin' our way
