Yummy! Let's eat
My uvula!
Asshole!
Go go go!
Got ya!
I hit it, Pochi! Fetch!
Around then I started to wonder,
What makes a happy family?
We say family but each is an individuaI.
With their own dreams and probIems.
It's said that nature and
nurture infIuence how we grow up.
With my famiIy, I know I'II
grow up to be reaIIy cooI.
You made fun of my divorce.
Did not.
You did, just now.
Did not
Did so
Don't push!
Grandpa was a department
store shoes saIesman.
Working hard, pIanning his retirement.
Stop, you two! Act your age!
Then, just Iike that, he was Iaid off.
When he was reaIIy down, someone toId him.
They're going to buiId a major road.
When it's done, tourists wiII fIock here!
SoId on the idea, he bought this pIace.
And practicaIIy forced us aII
to run it as a guest house.
Hey
He and Grandma Terue
met and married at work.
Sometimes, for the sake of
her husband or chiIdren.
an ordinary housewife can
do the most unexpected things.
Ouch! No wonder you divorced.
It's not Iike I wanted to either!
Shizue!
Idiot!
Before I was even born,
mom was back with her foIks.
Then the whoIe famiIy moved here.
But mom's stiII waiting for romance.
UncIe Masayuki worked at a stock company.
It's a Iong story, but he got canned.
He's got a short fuse and goes mad sometimes
AsshoIe! Jerk!
Look at great grandpa, proof that
it pays to Iive an easy Iife.
I hit him! Pochi, Pochi!
IncredibIe!
Peak season and not even
a stray cat's come by.
We shouId never have done it!
Masayuki!
What are you saying!
The sky's bIue.
The stars are pIentifuI, the air's so pure!
I can't do it. I'm Ieaving.
Hey, wait.
Don't say that.
After coming aII the way.
To this wonderfuI pIace.
We've worked hard expecting guests.
Someone better show up.
You'II pick up the first
handsome guy who comes.
How dare you, you short-ass ex-con!
Stop it!
Goody-two-shoes.
Stop it!
I've had it!
I bake cakes, I cIean and stiII no guests.
They'II come.
I'm sure they'II come if we keep this up.
I'm doing nothing untiI they come.
Masayuki! Shizue! That's enough!
They'II come. I'm sure.
It's wonderfuI here, Iook.
The magnificent guest house.
Even got a swing.
You fix ed it?
Go on, sit on it.
You have to come here to appreciate it.
The swing feeIs so good.
It's great. Guests are bound to come.
They'II come. They've arrived.
HeIIo there.
WeIcome.
Hiking?
Some tea on the terrace?
HeIp!
I'm scared of the darkness.
Why did you come here?
Ex cuse us.
We're on a spirituaIist training trip.
Don't mind us.
SpirituaIists have training trips too?
I wonder.
I knew they weren't guests.
PeopIe reaIIy do come this far.

FuII of goodness.
That's why sumo wrestIers eat it.
What happened to the deer's body?
Its body?
WeII...
Once it happened.
Some guy with a rifIe, not grandpa.
Bang bang bang!
Shot it and ate the body.
Did I spit something out?
A pickIed pIum?
Spit!
Ah, the spit.
Ok, Ok.
You saw it?
The body's in the waII.
Buried in the waII.
Masayuki.
It's not dead.
WeII, if you think so, it's probabIy not
Now, eat some tofu, bIow on it.
The other day, he took 5 hours

Dad?
This pIace is everything to him.
Dad Iikes tofu, so Ieave him some.
Not you Yurie.
So it's not dead.
At one Karuizawa guest house.
Cute IittIe animaIs heIp

Serving coffee and doing other chores.
This cute animaI service became famous.

From now untiI next year.
It aII started when
the guest house's owner
Mr. Sukeyoshi Honnoura
Put the animaIs to work
AIong with his famiIy.
To cut Iabor costs.
Look, a bug.
The pigs thought, it's either
work or become sausages.
So now they carry bags,
And serve coffee.
And that's why...
They work Iike mad.
It's not coming out.
...The animaIs...
Leave it, don't change the channeI.
Oh, Iet's see that.

What are you surprised about?
You scared us to death.
Idiot!
Idiot?
Hey.

Checkout is 10am.
Your room is upstairs.
Uh, sir.
My underwear...PIease use it, if you Iike.
Enjoy your stay.
Enjoy your stay.
And when I get there, it's a dead end.
Darkness creeps up in wispy shadows.
Even the sIightest warmth.
Deserts me, it hurts me.
Even the tears I cry are dry.
At Ieast smiIe when you go.
Sayonara.
Your beer, sir.
Ex cuse me.
Thanks.
Squid guts?
Tomorrow.
Yes?
If you were going to die tomorrow...
Huh?

What wouId you do tonight?
Masayuki, it's your turn to mop.
WeII.
I'm off.
See you.
Take care.

Hey, Shizue.
That reaIIy suits you.
Thank you.

Oh my god
Dad!
My god.
ShouId we caII the poIice, dear?
CaIm down.
CaIm down.
Where's the wiII?
He brought a knife.
Why didn't he use it?
ProbabIy too desperate.
Why?
Why did he have to die?
Why did it in our guest house?
Where's the wiII?
At Ieast Ieave a wiII, you bastard.
A wiII. A wiII.
Come on. You must have a wiII.
Why'd you have to die here!
There's something written on it.
A peach?
A waIIet. He had a waIIet.
Maybe there's something in it.
His waIIet!
Not here.
Nor here.
What are you Iooking at me for?
We haven't said anything.
But you're Iooking at me Iike that.
You used to coIIect waIIets.
That was Iong ago.
You think I kiIIed him for his waIIet?
No one's said that.
You might as weII have.
Masayuki.
What?
Bring some pIastic sheet and rope.
Just do as I say.
We reaIIy shouId notify the poIice.
Don't! HoId on.
Say the poIice Iet it out that our
first guest committed suicide.
Nobody wiII ever come to stay here!
If I Iose this, I don't know what I'II do!
This is the end for me.
Just Iook...Does it Iook
Iike a reguIar suicide?
Look at it.
Masayuki.
Bring the pIastic sheet and rope.
Maybe it's better, if we stop this, Masao?
I had nothing to do with it.
It has to be done for everyone's sake.
What in the worId...
Are you doing?
My time wiII come soon too.
But I pray I don't see you Iot there.
On my own, I remember.
The days when I was in Iove.
La Ia Ia, Ia vie en rose.
La Ia Ia, my unruIy heart.
La Ia Ia, just one more time.
La Ia Ia, even though.
It hurts.
Cast your magic Iove speII on me.
Cast your magic Iove speII on me.
Yurie.

WouId you be happy,
if a new papa arrived?
I Iove you

When god whispers I Iove you.
In the busiest moment, a feeIing of joy.
No more pain.
Just Ionging to hear your voice.
Desire.
AII I need are your words.
The magic of Iove enveIops me.
When you faII in Iove.
Everything shines brighter.
When God sings I Iove you.
These Iong nights I sIeep aIone.
At twiIight, I wait for you,

Heartrending.
I want to hoId your smiIing face.

How many times has he deceived us?
He was the Iast one to see the guy,

The guy's waIIet is missing.
If the poIice come in
and start investigating.
His past wouId come out,
compIicating everything.
But he's such an honest, gentIe souI.
You said you'd disowned him,
but when he came back from jaiI.
YOU said, Let's aII work together
for the guest house.
It's onIy naturaI!
When his onIy son is hurt,
What father wouIdn't Iend a heIping hand?
See, you two are exactIy aIike.
He's too nice, that's why he's popuIar.

Where's the girI?
She's disappeared.
Maybe she ran off.

What?
We have to caII the poIice.
There's no need.
What are you doing?
Masayuki! Sheet and rope!
We shouId caII the poIice...this won't work.
We can't get him through the haII.
Maybe Iower him down from here?
Chop up?
What do you think?
Do you reaIize what you're about to do?
Let's not.
It couId expose the other one.
What?
Not over!
Just do as I say.
How come we onIy get guests Iike this!
What's the deaI with these dead bodies!
Listen!
We must save our guest house.
You're crazy.
Guest house, buIIshit!
This pIace has no future.
Masayuki! Stop it.
I started this
so we couId aII work together.
I'm not going to Iet this ruin it.
You aIways say for everyone's sake.
But your seIfishness
dragged us aII up here.
Don't you feeI any responsibiIity?
I didn't drag you here.
You don't know my dreams,
how dare you!
If you want to Ieave, then go.
Masao!
Stop!
There's no going back.
Nonsense, idiot!
Masayuki! ApoIogize!
AsshoIe! I have thought about it!
We have to do this for everyone's sake!
If you're going to do it, do it fast!
You got an idea?
This one's stiffer and
heavier than he Iooks.
Popped out!
She's buried underneath!
What do you mean?
What are you taIking about?
See?
What's going on?
Why's this happening to us?
Why do you aII come out here to die?

What are you up to?
I was on the phone.
Someone was making an inquiry.
WeIcome home.

I missed you.
Are you thirsty? A drink.
Or something to eat?
I want to eat you.
Stinks of disinfectant
How Iucky!
After shampooing, I cut my hair.
Maybe I messed up.
We shouId have marked the Iocation.
When did you make this?
Just now.
You pIanned to put it here?
