So here's what you missed
last week
Quinn's pregnant
You're off the cheerios
..and everyone thinks that
Finn's the father....
...but really its Puck
...but Quinn thinks he's a
lime-a-loser and doesn't
want anything to do with him.
Somethin' else..
Also, Kurt told everybody
he's gay including his dad..
Who's actually kinda cool about it..
Thanks for telling me, Kurt
..and that's what you missed on...
GLEE!
You shouldn't do this
to yourself.
Do what?
I know how much it hurts
to be off the team.
You're just torturing yourself
watching them.
I needed a good distraction.
From what?
$685?
That's how much
a sonogram costs.
This is just
the beginning.
There's going to be
more doctor's visits,
Vitamins, new clothes
for when I explode.
What are we going to do?
What are you going to do?
I'm looking for a job.
I mean, no one's hiring.
I almost got in
at olive garden,
But they said I was too tall
to be a busboy.
Somewhere in that pea brain
of yours is a man.
Access him and tell him
to prove to me
That I chose the right guy
to have a baby with.
I will.
I-I'll find a job.
You can count
on me, I swear.
Where you going?
You were right.
This does hurt too much.
My blog has lit up
with comments
Suggesting you don't have
a shot at nationals
Since you lost
Quinn Fabray.
No, the cheerios are
stronger than ever.
We're gonna take nationals
with this routine.
Mediocre.
Hit the showers.
I have several
sources reporting
Quinn didn't want to leave,
But you kicked her out because
of the pregnancy scandal.
Well, jacob,
this is ohio.
And in order to win,
my cheerios need
To appeal to that
panel of judges.
So if I have a pregnant
girl doing a handspring
into a double layout,
The judges aren't going to be
admiring her impeccable form,
They're going to be wondering
if the centrifugal force
Is going to make the baby's
head start crowning.
Oh, and by the way, all
this-- off the record.
Probably should have
told you that earlier.
This isn't fair.
Is it fair that I had to stop
providing the baseball team
With protective cups?
I only get a certain
amount of dollars a year
To spend, Wiliam.
Yeah, but Artie is...
Is used to overcoming
challenges.
He'll just have to find
his own ride to sectionals.
That handi-capable bus
costs $600 a week to rent.
We can't afford it.
Oh, but there's enough
money in the budget
To fly the cheerios all over the
country for their competitions?
Sue Sylvester has boosters
that write fat checks.
None of her travel expenses
come out of the school budget.
Look, when I was in
the glee club,
The best part
of the competitions
Was the bus ride
to the event.
It was about camaraderie
and supporting each other.
You think I feel good
about this?
Well, my students
won't stand for it.
That's very moving,
but my hands are tied, Shue.
If you want that bus, you're
going to have to find a way
To pay for it yourself.
ReSync'd and case corrected by WheezerTheGeezer
What about Target?
Tried.
Not hiring.
Another doctor bill came to my
parents' house last night, Finn.
We're lucky that I'm clever
and intercepted it.
But we have to start
paying these doctor's bills
Or they're going to go
to a collection agency
And then my parents are going
to find out that I'm with child.
Your child.
Will:
All right, guys.
We're doing a new number
for sectionals.
I know that pop songs
Have sort of been
our signature pieces,
But I did a little research
on past winners,
And it turns out
that the judges like songs
That are more accessible.
Stuff they know.
Uh, standards,
Broadway.
"defying gravity"?
I have an ipod shuffle
dedicated exclusively
This is amazing.
Think you can handle it,
Rachel?
It's my go-to
shower song.
It's also
my ringtone.
Mercedes: Why do we have to go
all vanilla on this song?
See, what we need
Is my chocolate thunder.
Okay, we don't have time
to rearrange a song
For you, mercedes.
Rachel is singing it.
Don't worry, we'll
find something for you
To dip in chocolate.
On to item two.
The school won't pay
for the special bus we need
To take Artie and his wheelchair
with us to sectionals.
W-w-what?!
That's completely unfair.
So we're going to have to raise
money to pay for it ourselves.
See, when I was
in glee club,
And we needed new silk
cummerbunds for regionals,
We held a bake sale.
Santana:
You're joking, right?
I mean, bake sales
are kind of bougie.
So hip people stopped eating
delicious sugary treats?
It's not that.
It's most of us
don't know how to bake.
I find recipes confusing.
My family is fully
committed to takeout.
Yeah, Mr. Shue, kids are busier
than when you went here.
We've got homework and football
and teen pregnancy, lunch.
Can't Artie's dad
just take him?
I can't believe how insensitive
you're all being.
Are you a team?
Of course.
But Artie understands,
don't you, Artie?
Oh... Of course.
It's cool.
Anything that takes away
our time from rehearsing
Doesn't serve the team.
Let me help you out,
buddy.
Thank you.
Hey, I'm really sorry about how
they all reacted, Artie.
Oh, it's okay.
I'm used to it.
They just don't get it.
Can I use the auditorium
this afternoon
To rehearse, Mr. Shue?
Some of the band
equipment's in there.
Sure.
~~ on the floor of Tokyo-o ~~
~~ or down in London town
to go-o ~~
~~ with the record selection
with the mirror reflection ~~
~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~
~~ when there's no one else
in sight ~~
~~ in a crowded lonely ni-ight ~~
~~ well, I wait so long
for my love vibration ~~

~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~
~~ I'm dancing

seem to pass me by ~~

I have something
I'd like to say.
I want to audition
for the Wicked solo.
Kurt, there's a high "F" in it.
That's well within my range.
Well, I think Rachel's
going to be fine
For the female lead,
but I'm happy to have you
Try out something else, Kurt.
And we'll make sure
it's got a killer high note.
Artie:
You tried.
Anyway,
I wanted to say
something to you guys.
I was a little disappointed
at how you were all so willing
To take the bus
to get to sectionals
And make Artie drive by himself
with his dad.
We're a team, guys.
We're in this glee club
together.
Artie doesn't care.
His dad drives him everywhere.
I do care.
It kind of hurt my feelings.
We didn't think you would
take it personally.
Well, you're irritating
most of the time,
But don't take that personally.
I don't know if you guys
really understand
How much harder Artie
has to work just to keep up.
Preach.
We're riding
to sectionals together
Or we're not going at all.
And to pay for the bus,
we're having a bake sale.
Bake sale...
St. Ignatius
nursing home
Was having a tag sale,
And my av club friends here
agreed to help out.
For the next week,
Each of you is going
to spend three hours a day
In a wheelchair.
Oh, oh, oh.
And we're doing
a wheelchair number.
Billy Idol:
~~ on the floors of Tokyo-o ~~
~~ or down in London town
to go-go ~~
~~ with the record selection
and the mirror's reflection ~~
~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~
~~ well, there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove ~~
~~ well, I'm dancing
with myself ~~
~~ oh, oh, oh. ~~
Puck:
I didn't even know we
had a home rec room.
What's all this?
Ingredients for cupcakes
For the stupid bake sale.
What's this?
It's what I have left over
from my pool cleaning money.
After I bought dip
and nunchakus.
I was getting that you
kinda need money.
For our kid.
How much has
Finn given you?
Just stop.
I told you before,
I don't care if that baby
comes out with a mohawk,
I will go to my grave
swearing it's Finn's.
It would be pretty awesome
if it came out with a mohawk.
You are such an egghead.
I'm not.
ah!
That was perfectly measured!
There you go!
What the hell?
We're baking.
I can see that.
I'm gonna go change.
Where's my jelly creme center?
Sorry, dad, I must've forgotten.
What's up with your brain today?
You know,
I think it's going soft
From all that crap
you put in your hair.
It's organic and I'm fine.
I'm sorry,
it's a glee club thing.
It's not about a guy, is it?
'cause I'm not ready
to have that conversation.
Oh, at least you don't
have to worry about me
Getting someone pregnant.
It's not a guy.
We're doing this amazing song
for sectionals,
A personal favorite of mine,
And Mr. Schuester won't
give me a chance to sing it.
Why?
It's traditionally
sung by a girl.
Well, you sing like a girl.
You know, in a good way.
Look, Kurt, I don't know
How this music stuff works.
I'm pretty exclusively committed
to my mellencamp collection
But isn't there more
crossover nowadays?
You know,
chicks doing construction,
Guys wearing dress shoes
with no socks?
Didn't that girl
from your high school
Just join the boy's
wrestling team?
yes!
Whoo!
Yes, but her parents
had to Sue the school.
This is really getting
you down, isn't it?
I'm full of ennui.
So, it's really
getting you down?
Yes.
You can't discriminate against
my kid because of his sex,
Religion,
political affiliation
Or the fact that he's queer
as a three dollar bill.
And I won't accept it.
This isn't academics
Or athletics, Mr. Hummel.
It's an arts program
and Mr. Schuester's
Judgments are subjective.
You put on a blindfold
and listen to my kid sing,
And you will swear you're
hearing Ronnie Spector.
Wait.
Don't try to backpedal
on this, Schuester.
I was just going
to agree with you.
I know this is going
to be hard on you, Rachel,
But I can't,
in good conscience,
Preach about the importance
of helping Artie
And then reject Kurt's request
out of hand.
So, you're giving him my part?
Now, I can't just
give him the part.
That would be just as wrong,
but I can let him audition.
What do you mean,
like a tryout?
All right, that seems fair.
This is totally unfair.
You gave me the part.
And I will give it to you again
If you can sing the song
better than Kurt.
Okay, this seems
like a reasonable deal.
But how do I know this
isn't just some show
To stop me from
taking a flamethrower
To this place?
Who's going to judge?
Now, all of you
are going to judge,
And in the spirit
of full access,
Each of you
is going to get a vote.
Whatever singer
has the most votes,
Gets the part.
This isn't going to be
about talent, Mr. Schuester.
It's going to be
a popularity contest.
Stop right there.
Mr. Shue, if I may.
We all know
I'm more popular than Rachel.
And I dress better than her.
But I want you all
to promise me that you're
Going to vote for whoever
sings the song better.
Raise your right hand.
It's this one.
Sorry.
Repeat after me.
I promise to vote for
whoever sings the song better.
All:
I promise to vote for
whoever sings the song better.
It's on.
All right, guys.
Maybe one of these days
you'll find a way to create
Teaching moments
without ruining my life.
Shue, I saw all your kids
in wheelchairs
And I was very impressed.
Well, thank you,
principal Figgins,
But actually, it's made me
realize that there's only
One wheelchair entrance
in this school
And it's all the way on
the far end of campus.
Mckinley needs ramps.
No way.
Those are what I call
"lazy makers."
They discourage
our able-bodied students
From getting their proper
exercise by using the stairs.
What is she doing here?
Yes, what am I doing here?
I have a cheerios routine
to polish
That's gonna
clinch us nationals.
I brought you two in here
Because both of you
have a point.
Handicapped ramps are expensive,
But inspiration is free.
Will, I'm so inspired by
your stunt that I'm insisting
That Ms. Sylvester do
the same with the cheerios.
I beg your pardon?
Cheerios is not accessible, Sue.
It's by invitation only.
I want to see a squad
That reflects
our community's diversity.
Now, glee club
held open auditions.
And everyone got in.
Now that Quinn Fabray
Is off the squad,
you will hold open auditions
To fill her slot
And Mr. Schuester
Will monitor them
to make sure
That they are fair to all.
Okay, let me break this
down for you here.
There comes a point
When you've got to stop seeing
people for what they look like,
And ask them to show you
what they can do.
And as soon as
a cheerleader
Rolls herself out onto
the field in a wheelchair,
She becomes decidedly less
effective at cheering people up.
It's just a fact.
No, Sue, the fact is you've
never given other students
The fair shake
that they deserve.
I'm asking you to try it.
What do you have to lose?
Maybe somebody at this school
will surprise you.
Finn:
Cupcake?
These cupcakes suck.
That's why we're
not selling any.
It's not about the cupcakes.
It's about us.
Nobody wants to buy from losers.
We're in glee club
and in wheelchairs.
She has a point.
Six months ago
I could've sold
on fear alone.
Oh, my god.
What is she doing?!
I actually think
they're kind of friends.
Brittany is always cheating off
her test papers in math class.
See, so many?
And look how pretty
they are, Becky.
Wow.
Brittany, you're supposed
to be in your wheelchair.
I lost it.
Are you a cheerleader?
It's so cool.
So is buying a cupcake.
That's really cool.
But I don't have any money.
That's okay,
I have some.
Thanks.
So, how much do we have now?
Well, with this one dollar,
we have... One dollar.
This is ridiculous.
Well, maybe if we put
a jelly bean or something
On top we'd sell more.
Are you an idiot?!
How am I supposed to trust you
to take care of our baby
When you can't even figure out
how to sell a damn cupcake?
Stop attacking me.
I'm sick of it.
Get a job.
I'm trying!
Sue:
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing here.
You just call a name,
they come in and try out.
Just give them a chance
to express themselves.
I'm about to projectile
express myself
All over your
hush puppies.
Mckinley, hey, hey.
Mckinley, hey, hey.
No.
No.
You're not serious, are you?
Tell me you're not serious.
No.
No friggin' way, jacob.
Freak!
Okay, I've been at this for
an hour, that's all I promised.
Sue, there's just one
more person on the list.
Give her a shot.
Becky Johnson!
Jackson.
Jackson.
:
Be nice, Sue.
I heard that you're doing
a routine with jump ropes.
I wanted to show you
what I can do.
Becky, I'm going to stop you
right there.
You're in.
Be at practice tomorrow
at 4:00 p.M.
Congratulations.
What are you up to, sue?
I'm just following orders, Will.
I'm doing what I was told.
And I found myself
a brand-new cheerio.
You're up to something.
I don't like this, sue!
I'm just saying,
she has a point.
You are kind
of an idiot.
Nice support, dude.
Whatever happened
to bros before hos?
You've got a baby
on the way, bro.
And you haven't done spit
to take care of it.
Like you'd do
any different?
Damn straight.
How?
Nobody's hiring.
Sell your Xbox,
rob a bank,
Go all Robin Hood on this joint,
whatever it takes.
all I ever hear is you
Whining and crying
about how hard this is on you.
What about her?
Dude, you are so out of line!
You don't know
what I'm dealing with!
All I know is that you're a punk
Who doesn't deserve to have
Quinn as his girlfriend.
You're a punk!
Will:
Hey, hey, break it up!
Break it up!
Come on!
Hey!
He started it.
I don't care!
Now...
You-you guys are best friends.
What the hell is going on?
I'm just really stressed
about the bake sale.
I really like Artie, okay?
You okay?
The key to a double turn
is to just go for it.
You push with the
right wheel and pull
as hard as you can
With the left, and find a spot
on the wall to spot you,
So you don't get dizzy.
Will:
Okay, guys,
take five, all right?
Oh, remember to show up early
on Thursday.
It's Rachel versus Kurt
For the big solo.
Careful.
Artie:
Respect the chair.
I really admire you, Artie.
I had no idea
how difficult this was.
It's just like you
with your stutter.
You don't really notice
it after awhile.
Ho-ho-how did it happen?
You don't talk about it.
My mom and I got in
a really bad car accident
When I was eight.
And she was fine, but I've been
in the chair ever since.
But I want to be very clear--
I still have the use
of my penis.
excuse me a second.
Hummel tire and lube.
Yeah. Who is this?
Man:
Your son's a fag.
Kurt:
Hey, dad.
What the hell is wrong
with this machine?
I hit it, the high "f."
The magical note I need
for "Defying Gravity."
I hit it.
It means I'm going to win.
That's great.
Good for you.
Just how long till
the damn coffee's ready?
What's going on?
I got a phone call this morning.
The anonymous kind.
It was some dude telling me
my son was a fag.
Oh.
Well, that's not a big deal.
I get that all the time.
Yeah, but I don't.
Now look, Kurt, I...
I try to do right by you--
you know, open some doors.
What father wouldn't do
that for his kid?
And I know
it's good for you
To be out there with all this
glee club stuff.
I just... I don't want you
to get hurt.
So you don't want me to audition
for the solo?
No, no, let me be clear,
all right?
No one pushes
the Hummels around.
Especially cowards on the phone.
Sometimes I just... I wish your
mom was still around, you know?
She was better
At handling this kind of thing,
you know, handling me.
Well, congrats on, uh...
You know, the cool "A"
or the high "C"
Or whatever.
High "F".
Yeah.
There's your problem.
You just had a bad push rim.
Good as new.
Thanks, Finn.
You're the only one
who's willing to help me.
I'm really nervous about
the diva-off tomorrow.
Don't be.
I don't want to win
out of charity.
I want to win the solo
because it's right for the club.
I really think that the
judges at sectionals
Will find a female version
of "Defying Gravity"
Much more accessible.
But I don't think
that's going to happen.
People just don't like me.
Yeah, you might want
to work on that.
But I like you.
We need to talk.
I'll get out of your way.
No, you stay.
I need a witness.
Do you know
what this is?
Oh, it's just a
past due notice.
My mom gets them
all the time.
Right, but if this sonogram
bill doesn't get paid,
It's not your phone
that's going to get cut off.
You will get cut off.
You need to help me
with this, Finn.
Or else we're going to go
our separate ways.
I'm screwed.
Not necessarily.
I know, I know, I know, I know.
Hey. Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, this is amazing.
Santana:
Hi.
Puck found his nana
connie's old recipe.
They're addictive.
Do you want one?
No, no, thanks.
Don't want to take one away
from a paying customer.
Yeah, no, sure.
Hey, nice work, buddy.
These are so good.
Puck:
This isn't Nana Connie's
old recipe.
She was a diabetic, so the only
sweets she had in her house
To help Quinn out
with our baby.
I don't know what kind
of stuff you need
For a baby that's still
in your stomach--
Bottles, diapers,
that kind of thing, I guess.
But my baby mama
was going to get it all.
I used the two things
I know the most about--
Is there a lot
of pain, Noah?
:
The doctor said the shark
fractured my spinal cord.
This is why I don't go
to the aquarium.
I'm going to give you
as much as you want,
Puck:
I don't put in enough
to get you hallucinating,
Just enough to give you
a wicked case of the munchies.
That's why they keep
coming back for more.
See, I told you
I'd make a great dad.
Sue:
Faster.
Harder.
Those better be
Tears of joy, Becky.
Faster!
Harder!
Okay, stop.
Becky, this is terrible.
I tried, coach.
This is really hard.
You think this is hard?
Try auditioning
for Baywatch
And being told that they're
going in another direction.
That was hard.
Hit the showers.
Thanks, coach.
Hi.
Sue, you are unbelievable.
And you are
a terrible spy.
You might try breathing
through your nose sometime.
If you were a sniper,
I would have already
radioed in your coordinates.
Just like in the Falklands.
I'm not going to let
you bully that girl, Sue.
Oh, I bully
everybody, will.
It's the way I roll.
Yeah, but this
is different.
She's not like
everybody else.
I want you to listen
to what you just said, William.
You're asking me to treat
this girl differently
Because she has a disability.
When actually,
it seems to me,
She just wants to be treated
like everybody else.
Why are you doing this?
Because I know you.
And you're up to something.
You don't know
the first thing about me.
Good luck.
:
I'm rooting for you.
All right,
welcome to the glee club's
First official diva-off.
Let's get this party started.
~~ something has changed
within me ~~
~~ something is not the same ~~
~~ I'm through with playing
by the rules ~~
~~ of someone else's game ~~
~~ too late for second-guessing ~~
~~ too late
to go back to sleep ~~
~~ it's time to trust
my instincts ~~
~~ close my eyes and leap... ~~
~~ it's time to try
defying gravity ~~
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity... ~~
~~ kiss me good-bye,
I'm defying gravity ~~
~~ and you won't bring me down ~~
~~ I'm through accepting limits ~~
~~ 'cause someone says
they're so... ~~
~~ some things I cannot change ~~
~~ but till I try
I'll never know... ~~
~~ too long
I've been afraid of ~~
~~ losing love
I guess I'd lost... ~~
~~ well, if that's love, it comes
at much too high a cost... ~~
~~ I'd sooner buy
defying gravity... ~~
~~ kiss me good-bye,
I'm defying gravity... ~~
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity ~~
~~ and you won't bring me down ~~
~~ I'd sooner buy
defying gravity... ~~
~~ kiss me good-buy,
I'm defying gravity... ~~
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity ~~
:
~~ and you won't
bring me down... ~~
:
~~ bring me down ~~
~~ oh, oh, oh, oh... ~~
~~ oh. ~~
Wiliam:
Good job, Kurt.
Good job.
Hey, wait up.
I cracked open
the piggy bank.
It's for you.
Well, it's for it.
It is a she.
Cool.
I told you I wasn't a deadbeat.
Look, Puck, this is
really sweet, but...
I can get more.
People call me
a screw-up because...
I think school's for suckers,
but I got ambition.
I can get us a house.
Some stuff.
Furniture.
We could be a family.
Finn is your best friend.
He'd be pissed for a while.
But then he'd realize he doesn't
have to deal with all this.
He'd bake me a damn cake.
You stole from
the cupcake fund.
No, I didn't.
Fine, I did.
I made all those cupcakes.
I'm all about
being a team player,
But my family comes first.
I get it.
And I'm sorry.
I should have never
called you a lima loser.
You're not.
You're special
and a romantic
And a good enough person
To realize that we are
not going to take money
From a friend in
a wheelchair.
Hey.
Here.
What's this?
I got a job.
Excuse me.
Are you the manager?
Yes.
You need to hire my friend Finn.
He is clearly handi-capable
and refusing to hire him
Could be seen as
discrimination.
My dads are gay and unless
you want the full force
Of the American Civil Liberties
Union coming down on you,
I'd work something out.
I'm going to need
to stay in my wheelchair
As long as I'm working there,
But screw it, it's worth it.
Can I give you a lift
to rehearsal?
And two cases of Natty Light
for the ride home.
Oh, dream on, buddy.
I'm very proud of you guys.
Artie...
Why don't you bring this
to principal Figgins yourself?
All right, Artie!
Artie!
What's wrong, dude?
I really appreciate
what you guys did for me,
But I'm not the only kid
in a wheelchair at this school.
And I'm sure there will be
others after I graduate.
And I know how important it is
for all of us to go
To sectionals together,
But I think I'd rather
just get a ride from my dad
And use this for a handicapped
ramp in the auditorium.
Any objections?
Well, sure beats having
to carry him in every day.
You think she has a brain tumor?
That can cause erratic behavior.
All I know is that
she walked in unannounced
And she wrote me a check for
three new handicapped ramps.
I just don't get it.
I mean, first putting Becky
in cheerios, now this.
What is her angle?
Why ask why?
Just enjoy the fact that you're
getting your bus after all.
How's she doing?
Great.
She asks about you.
She's been watching you on tv.
I need to get
here more often.
Oh, you get here plenty.
Jean?
Your little sister's here
to see you.
Hey, sue!
Hi. Hi, honey!
My sister is famous.
You got that right.
I got something for you.
What's this?
Wow! A pom-pom!
Thank you.
That's for you.
What do you feel like
doing today?
Can we read today?
Look what I have!
Right. Your favorite book.
Want to start
at the beginning?
Yes.
All right.
You ready?
Ready.
"once upon a time,
"there was a little girl
who lived in the forest.
"whenever she went out,
the little girl
"wore a red riding cloak,
"so everyone in the village
Called her
little red riding hood."
Right?
Right.
Oh, no!
Oh, you're so
much faster!
You can't keep up?
I can't. This
is so hard. No.
no f-f-fair!
You have eight
years of practice!
Excelling at wheelchair races
is about my only advantage.
It's like your stutter.
It's mostly
just a big hassle.
This has been a really fun date.
But I want to get
out of this chair.
Why?
So I can do this.
I have to tell you something.
I've been faking it.
Faking what?
I don't have a stutter.
I pretended to have
one in sixth grade
Because I didn't
want to give a speech
On the Missouri compromise.
I was really shy,
And it made people
think I was weird,
So they left me alone.
And it wasn't until I joined
glee club that I realized
How much I was missing.
And I don't want to push
people away anymore.
You understand what
that's like, don't you?
No, I don't.
I would never try
to push people away
'cause being in a chair
kind of does that for you.
I thought we had something
really important in common.
Wait, Artie. I'm sorry.
I am, too.
I'm sorry now
you get to be normal
And I'm going to be stuck in
this chair the rest of my life.
And that's not something
I can fake.
Hey, dad.
What are you doing?
I'm making biscuits. What
does it look like I'm doing?
How did the tryout go?
They gave the part
to Rachel.
I knew they were
going to rig it.
I'm going down to that school
and I'm talking to Schuester.
I blew the note.
I wanted to lose.
Kurt, I stuck my neck
out for you,
And you go
and you throw the game?
Dad, I've known who I
was since I was five.
I adapted.
Being different
made me stronger.
And at the end of the day,
It's what's going to get me
out of this cow town.
You never had to do that.
I can handle myself just fine.
No, you can't.
Not about this.
That phone call yesterday
was just the beginning.
Especially if I get up
in front of a thousand people
To sing a girl's song.
When I saw you
right after you got the call,
And you were so hurt
And so upset...
...It just killed me.
I'm not saying I'm going
to hide in the closet.
I'm-I'm proud of who I am.
I'm just saying that I love you
more than I love being a star.
You are your mother.
You know,
she was always the strong one.
Look, uh,
You want to help me put
a 195 on this bad boy, huh?
Let me change
into my coveralls.
This sweater's an
Alexander McQueen.
This one's for you, Artie!
