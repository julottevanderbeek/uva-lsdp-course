There was a village in the world.
There was such a king.
Who was adored by everyone.
There was no one like him.
Everyone was extremely
happy in the village.
Their lives were full of
joy and love.
Each house was like his own house.
Everyone was equally
dear to him.
He used to share the
joys & sorrows of everyone.
His presence was
a joy for everyone.
You were saying... That we'll be welcomed
grandly at the station.
Nobody is here.
This Joshpura.
Both the village & its
villagers are unique.
Greetings. - Greetings, welcome
...Junior boss.
Please accept our heart
felt affection.
Why did you stop?
Play... Play...
Brother...
Come on dance.
Brother, in the morning itself...
I was very happy that you are coming
...that's why 2 Pegs...
Shakti, who is she?
- She's Anita.
Anita, my elder brother...
Greetings.
I had told you about him...
What's this? Such long
hair like girls.
Brother this is the latest
style, Funk style.
Bunk... Petrol
filling station.
You keep quiet & put the
luggage in the car.
Shall we go brother...
- Take all the luggage...
Father told me to bring manure...
You go ahead, I'll come soon.
Give me car keys, I'll drive.
- I'm there to drive why should you?
I'll be driving in my village
after 5 years, its no joke.
You'll drive.
- Yes, I'll drive.
Tell me, one thing junior boss.
Who is this tall ladder like lady?
- Your sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law! You got
married in London!
Your would be sister-in-law.
Oh I see! I thought we'll have to
forgo marriage sweets. - Sit in car...
Grandpa, uncle has come...
Mother, come soon
uncle has come.
Greetings sir.
Greetings Junior Boss.
My respects father.
- May you live long son.
You've told father
haven't you?
Who is she?
She was studying with me in
the college, Anita... My...
Sister-in-law must've told you...
Hey... lt's alright...
Come children...
Father, sister-in-law is beating me.
Reform Gando.
Did you hear that, Balli?
Your uncle is welcoming
his son in such a way,
As if he hasn't returned from
foreign country but from the border,
After winning the battle, give...
Too much wealth generates
extravagance father.
That's why, your elder brother is
burning the candle at both ends.
Burning is a crime in law...
And I can prove this in the court.
I don't remember the section
at the moment.
Greetings Junior Thakur.
You're belching Junior Thakur.
Somebody is remembering you.
Catch...
People who used to remember
me have died.
Those who're alive are
devising ways to kill me.
Are you my wife or enemy
send the younger one. Go...
Whole day, I remove your filth
tolerate your abuses,
And the younger one is
more affectionate to you.
Tell her... Tell that devil to clean your
filth for one day. Then, you'll know.
Oh Empress! Come down your
husband is calling you.
Junior Thakur, there is nothing
wrong in having 2 wives.
But keeping them under the
same roof... requires lot of gall...
God knows how you manage
both of them... by yourself...
Then what is the relevance of a Thakur.
You're a Thakur & I can
prove this in the court.
Section isn't coming to my
mind at the moment.
Lot of mosquitoes here.
The girl who has come with you...
Grandpa... - Careful
you'll fall...
Yes... Where does she belong to.
- Ludhiana.
But her daddy has settled in London
for the past 20 years. - Grandpa.
I had told sister-in-law everything...
- It's okay.
Did Narendra meet you?
He had come to the station. You had
sent him to bring manure, hadn't you?
He must be on his way back.
Not manure. He must have
gone to buy liquor.
Liquor in the day.
Day & night makes no
difference to an addict.
Listen, entire village is assembling
this evening to welcome you.
You get ready earlier
- Okay father.
And Shakti... - Yes.
Tell that girl to dress properly
- Okay, father...
Drums have started beating.
Village is being decorated.
Somebody has returned.
How many hues he
has brought with him?
He is our charmer.
- We'll swing & sing.
He is our friend our darling.
We'll swing & sing.
Oh Friend! Don't ever leave us & go.
We fall at your feet
with folded hands.
We won't allow you to break
our heart & go away.
Our prince has come.
Ruler of our hearts has come.
How many hues he
has brought with him.
Our son has come...
We'll swing & sing.
Our heart is dancing.
We'll swing & sing.
It's like a heart which
is brimming with love.
My childhood companion,
my village...
Water of this well is very sweet.
The shade of these trees
is very soothing.
It's like music getting dissolved
in the breeze.
Please listen carefully the
sound of grinding stone.
Mellifluously it spreads
the music in a gentle rhythm.
Chirping of birds are tuneful.
I've returned after years...
This is a century old song.
Father Anita.
- Sit down.
I'll eat with the ladies afterwards.
You don't need to
behave like other women...
I mean, you're our guest.
Sit down.
Father you were saying something
about the land of betels.
Some agricultural experts had come
from France. What do you call them?
Horticulturists.
Yes, those people had come.
They were suggesting to grow
grapes on that land.
With that our farmers will
double their income.
I told them that my son has
gone to London for studies.
He'll take all the
decision on his return.
They started looking at me
in great amazement.
That the son of an uneducated farmer
has gone to London for studies.
I felt very proud about it.
So son. You take over the
management of this village.
And give me pension.
But father, I... - Yes... Yes...
Go ahead I'm listening.
I want to do something
else father. - What?
I want to... Chain of fast
food restaurants...
What rent you want to open.
Restaurants, where people
eat and drink...
Huh! Tea shop. Is this a business?
It's a flourishing business
in cities these days.
It might be in city, but it has
no credibility in the village.
Further, how're villagers going
to be benefited by it.
Not in this village. - Then.
Jaipur, Delhi, Agra etc.
So you want to leave the village
& settle down in the city.
But how did you get interested
in this strange business?
Anita's daddy has same
business in London.
He gave me this idea...
Does he know that she has
come here with you?
He only sent her.
Strange family.
Father, Anita's family has
a great reputation.
Anita's grandfather was
a freedom fighter.
Now they've a factory in Ludhiana.
Her uncle is looking after it.
When you're so well informed
about her family...
You must've matched
her horoscope also.
And you must've decided about
the date of the marriage also.
Father... You... Me...
Have you come to take my
permission or inform me?
Father, I had hoped that
you won't refuse.
I had written everything
to sister-in-law.
I see, sister-in-law also
knows everything.
So you've come to
tell me your decision.
What's your decision father?
Wash off my hands.
Yeah. - Your daddy embarked
on real bombardment. What now?
Infact, I was also thinking
about the same thing.
It's not that he can't be brought around.
But how to go about it.
Yeah. He seem to be a
real tough guy.
But outwardly he looks tough.
He has a very soft disposition.
Do you know, after the death of
my mother, he only brought me up.
And brother too.
How did we land up here
while talking.
Whose house is this?
My uncle's. Coming here
after a long time.
Who is it? - I'm Shakti, aunty.
Didn't you recognise me?
Shakti child, you.
- Yes, aunty, greetings.
May you live long
you're fine, aren't you?
With your blessings
I'm absolutely fine.
Shut up.
How did you come here?
...by plane?
Who is this boy with you?
She is not a boy, she is girl,
my friend... Anita.
Really! Be happy.
Who is outside?
- Nobody... Nobody is here.
Then, why is the dog barking?
It is hungry, that's why it's barking.
Why're you shouting?
You go, don't stay here
go from here, go...
Shakti, why've you come here?
Chotu, go and offer him
sweets, go...
Mother, Shakti took 2 laddoos.
Don't shout. - Mother Senior
mother is beating me.
Why do you hit me on the head?
If something goes wrong with my brain,
...Will you give me a penny?
Uncle doesn't like to see my face.
But aunty likes me a lot.
Then why was she telling to
go away again & again?
Otherwise, uncle would've
thrown her out.
Uncle feels that our family
is his enemy. - Why?
Why did 'Kauravas' consider
Pandavas their enemies?
Enemy! Inspite of
being a brother.
You took my photo madam.
Why? Shouldn't she have taken?
Obeisance to you Junior boss.
- Greetings.
Take, take as many
as you want, Yes...
Shakti, what's this?
That's 'Rangoli'.
Its beautiful.
- Art in everyday life.
Strange smell is coming.
I've put poder on
the face. It must be its smell.
It's not good smell, its
bad smell, bitter smell.
Bad smell.
Oh yes, my head must be smelling
like that. I've applied "Neem oil".
You also apply it, Lice
won't survive, really.
What is your name? - You didn't
recognise me Junior Boss.
I'm Gahna.
Remember when you were a kid
you used to learn to wield the stick.
One day you had broken my nose.
Oh Yes. I remember your nose
use to flow perpetually.
You're the daughter of
Naraindas? - Yes...
How is your father?
I'm alright, till now Junior boss.
But if Birju Thakur's
men see you here...
Then Balli Thakur will
deskin me. - Why.
Junior boss. In the war between
My father was a farmer
under Birju Thakur.
We've always been obeying him.
He doesn't want that you...
- I got you... don't elaborate, greetings.
Lets go Anita.
Hey Shakti, that's good. - What?
Those people with the sticks there.
You want to take some pictures.
- Yeah. - Come...
Junior boss... Junior boss
junior boss. - Be careful.
Where're you going that side.
- Anita wants to take some photos.
In that process some untoward
situation may arise.
You probably don't know. These're
Balli Thakur's fields.
Come to your area.
Come Shakti Thakur come.
You want to take some photos?
Go ahead... Do you remember?
We used to wield sticks
in childhood.
Yes, I remember very well.
Come lets have a small fight.
- Never...
Boss don't listen to him. He's trying
to rope you in a real fight.
Hey, will you shut up.
Don't be scared Shakti Thakur.
It won't be a real fight.
It'll be a friendly competition.
It's not the question of being afraid.
I've some work. Come...
I got it. You don't want to lose
your esteem infront of the girl.
Tell her to take photos & go.
Then, I'll show you the skill
of wielding the "Lathi".
Then, you show her
your prowess. - Hey.
Do you know whom you're talking to?
If you insist then lets
have a bit of a fight.
No... No... Boss listen to me.
Lets go from here.
You never leave the play ground
without playing.
That's the spirit. You'll fight
with the stick wearing a pant.
Surkhiya, lend me your "Dhoti".
What're you asking! Children are
watching. - Give me your dhoti.
Junior Boss my "Dhoti"...
- Are you giving or shall I pull it off...
Junior Boss my honour.
No point in measuring the stick
you should've the guts.
You're still a novice in "Lathi"
fight inspite of years of indulgence.
Practice...
His arrogance has met its waterloo.
Now give my "dhoti" back boss.
Junior boss! You aren't hurt
badly, are you?
Hey coward, you attacked
from behind, you rouge.
You'll get hurt during
the fight with the brave.
If you don't want to fight
then play with that madam.
Let the rascal have it.
This temple has our family deity.
You mean this is your
family temple? - Yeah.
Yes... Yes... The same tempo... Tempo...
Forget the temple Junior boss.
It is just the same when you left here.
Lets go somewhere else.
Don't be daft, I want to see it.
If you want to see... See it
from here, it looks great, wow.
Same innocent face
of Goddess mother.
It has been years since. I've seen you,
salutations to you mother.
Shakti, brother has come to see you.
What did you say? You're blessing
him from there itself.
Blessed... Blessed... Let's go...
Hey... Hey... where're you going?
Open the door... Open the door
come on, open the door.
How to? Aren't you seeing
these two locks.
Small lock of Junior Thakur &
the big one of Senior Thakur.
What do you mean?
brothers quarreled.
In the Panchayat, both of them
sniped at each other like dogs.
From both the sides abuses were
hurled, sticks were wielded.
And you know for what?
To claim ownership of this temple.
Nothing came out of it.
Poor Goddess mother got locked in.
Man commits the crime &
God is punished. Shall we go.
Yes, go home & get the
key from father.
Key. - Yes...
Father's key will open our lock.
But their lock... - Do anything
but open this door.
You order me to do anything
but forget about opening this door.
That's all, you got flummoxed
for such a small matter.
You used to make munificent promises.
"Junior boss, I can sacrifice my life for you!"
I can sacrifice my life even now
but this temple affair is very tricky.
These are all lame-ass
excuses Surkiya.
I was a fool to have told Anita.
That we can give our life
but we never go back on our promises.
You've ruined my
reputation completely.
But boss. - Don't talk to me.
I'll get it in a jiffy.
If it leads to serious problem
then forget it Shakti.
How to forget it darling.
It is very important for you
to see this temple. - Why?
Because, we're going to get
married in this temple only.
Really. Then, I must see it.
Junior Boss. Please come here.
Just stand here.
Turn your face the other side...
Stay like this.
Why're you standing?
Pay homage to the deity.
Don't take long, make
it real fast.
We'll be married here.
In the centre here,
there'll be a "Havan Kund".
What "Kund"?
"Havan Kund" you're going
to put me in a mess someday.
"Havan Kund" in which the
fire will burn. - I see.
We'll go round it 7 times & promise
to be together, till death...
I'll have some dreams in
my eyes covered with flowers.
You'll have some dreams in your eyes,
covered by the veil.
...We'll never get separated.
If we do, my eyes will search
entire universe for you.
Stars are the members of
the marriage party.
Moon light is the marriage party.
We'll go round the fire 7 times
with our hands clasped.
We shall be life partners
like the wick & the lamp.
When you're in my life.
I'll aspire for nothing else darling.
I worship you ordently
with my eyes.
Any word you say is
Holy commend to me.
What're you thinking?
- Nothing... I don't want to go.
Don't go, I didn't tell you to go.
I can't stay back also.
Daddy'll be waiting for me there.
I feel like crying...
I also feel like crying.
But, it's futile. Combination
of beard & tears isn't compatible.
Very funny.
Oh God! What's this nuisance?
- It's not closing.
I'll miss you Shakti.
- Even, I'll miss you.
When will you come?
I'll come soon. I'll stay
with father for 10-20 days.
to Cajole father.
As soon as, I get the permission
I'll & come to you, okay.
Now can I kiss you? - Please.
...I was closing the suitcase.
Babuji is calling you. - Both of us were
just about to come down.
He has called only you.
- Just me? - Hey... Hey... Hey...
Anita, not now... not now...
Coming father...
Hey, coming father...
Did you call me father?
Did you go to the temple?
Yes sir.
Why?
I wanted Anita to have a
glimpse of the family deity.
That's why, you broke its lock.
I told Surkhiya to bring the key.
I didn't anticipate
he'll break the lock.
It means, that when the lock
was broken... You were there.
Yes father... Yes.
Can't we visit our temple?
I accept, I made a mistake, but...
Wonderful son.
You did a great favour to me
by accepting your mistake.
Mr. Accountant. - Sir...
Tell them that its no use
amplifying the rukus.
If they so wish, I'm prepared to
apologise in the village assembly.
Father you...
- You keep quiet.
Because of your childishness.
There's a big uproar in the village,
do you know? Because of you...
Because of you?
What's it? I'm going.
What? - I'm going home. - Yes.
Father, the temple... - We'll talk
about the temple later.
Mr. Accountant, where is Surkhiya?
- Surkhiya will not come today.
You go and see her off.
Junior boss, don't go by the paved road.
- It'll be very circuitous otherwise.
Why don't you understand
what he says?
If you'll go that...
Will it hurt your pride
if you listen to him?
Junior Boss... Stop the car.
Don't go by this way Junior Boss.
Go by the culvert way.
Why? - Shankar, what's the problem?
Junior boss, the problem is
that our people,
Set fire to the huts of
Balli Thakur's fencers.
That's why, those people are
crying for our blood.
Burnt the huts? But why?
- Shall we be mute spectators?
For opening the door of
the temple, their goons...
Cut the hand of poor Surkhiya.
Cut the hand! Where is he?
- In the hospital.
He has lost lot of blood, but he'll live.
You go from here immediately.
Yes sir, you...
Come on, you sit in the car.
What is happening Shakti?
- I don't know what's going on.
I don't know when man
will become human.
Get on the train.
- Shakti, take care of yourself.
And don't get involved
in any problem, okay.
I love you. - Bye... Bye...
Bye. - Take care...
Bye, take care. - Bye...
Oh God. - Greetings boss.
- Come Junior boss.
Surkhiya... Surkhiya...
Look, Junior boss has come.
Don't worry Junior boss.
Just now Senior boss had come.
He told the doctors that
Surkiya is very dear to him.
They should take special
care of him.
I'll chop them, I won't leave the creeps.
The moment I lay my hands.
Junior boss.
Lift me. - Lie down...
lie down. Leave him.
I'm sorry junior boss.
Because of that rascal, I couldn't
drop you both to the station.
As soon as I came out of the house. That
rascal came from behind & cut my hand.
I wasn't going to leave him.
I chased him...
But I bled so much that...
on the way...
Sister-in-law reached the
station in time, didn't she?
I committed a big mistake Surkhiya.
Forgive me.
What're you talking Junior boss?
I never thought that, because of me,
your life'll be spoiled.
Why do you worry Junior boss?
I'll deal with Jaswant.
Which Jaswant?
- Balli Thakur's pet dog.
This hand has been cut by
the sword of that rouge.
Did you register a
complaint in the police?
We don't bother to
involve the police.
Here justice is handed out by
the village assembly or God.
God has handed out his justice,
their huts were burnt.
This isn't God Justice.
It's their doings.
Wow, junior boss you came
to know the fact so soon.
You're a great CID.
Shut up, aren't you ashamed.
You behave like animals &
laugh heartily too.
Are you human beings or animals?
Greetings Junior boss.
Mr. Inspector what's all this?
Why doesn't police take action.
What can the police
do without proof?
The person whose hand is cut,
says it was cut in an accident.
Hut owners say that their
huts got burnt by the fire place.
I don't get a single witness,
single accused in this village.
I pray to God to transfer
me from here.
Register the FIR.
Come here.
Went to the hospital?
Yes father?
Did you see?
How expensive it is to visit
God in this village.
Now you got the picture
of this place.
I made a big mistake father.
And before I commit another serious
mistake. I must go away from here.
Instead of solving this problem.
You want to run away from here.
Is this not cowardice.
To kill for trifles
isn't bravery father.
Are these people human
beings or animals.
They want to solve all problems
by bloodshed & murder.
Your father is also
one of those animals.
From that angle, I'm also one.
But this is not a matter of pride.
By staying in centuries
old primitive village...
I don't want my education
to go waste.
Yes, we're primitive.
But I can't pin point the century we
belong to. You tell me.
People who've been poor &
slaves for 100's of years.
Who weren't considered
even human beings.
If they behave like animals.
What's so surprising about it?
You're educated, try to understand
their short comings.
And think, how to change
their our look.
It'll take a long time.
And you don't have that much time.
By that time, I may be dead.
Then die...
Aren't you ashamed to talk about
dying infront of your father.
Insolent, mannerless. Which branch of
education has taught you this?
You were one year old
when your mother died.
I spared no efforts to bring you up.
Day & night were of no consequence.
I wasn't educated.
But to educate you, I sent you to
Gwalior, London. With the only hope,
That when you return, you'll
teach us noble ways of life.
But I didn't know, that education
makes a man self serving.
You do anything you like.
Marry according to your choice.
Do business dear to you heart.
But don't forget your duty
towards your village & your land.
You've misunderstand me father.
I want to do alot for
the villagers & I'll do it.
I feel suffocated here.
I feel an alien in this place.
Please permit me to go
away from here father.
Mr. Accountant, come here.
Where has everyone disappeared?
I'm here boss.
Arrange for his ticket.
My dear son wants to go.
Shall I book it for 2 weeks later.
Did you hear what
Mr. Accountant is saying?
Come here.
Can't you stay with your
father for a few days.
For 20 days, 15 days, 10 days.
I also want to talk to you
hear you talk to me.
I was longing to see you.
Who knows, on your return your
old father may be alive or dead.
Why're you talking
like this father?
I'm not leaving you & going...
The moment business gets set.
I'll take you with me, yes father.
No, I was born here &
I'll die here.
Don't even try to pull out
my roots from here Shakti.
Have faith in me father. I'll do a
mighty lot for the villagers.
Except you who else is there,
worthy of my faith.
Who else is there in this
house besides you, go...
Careful son.
There was water...
All the villagers are informed
that the door of this temple,
Are being opened to visit &
worship the Goddess by everyone.
But because the Government is
pondering over the tangle of this temple.
Till the Government
comes to a decision.
District Collector will
over see its management.
It'll be a legal offense it any
villager interferes in temple affairs.
Mr. Collector you've ordered
the opening of the temple.
Please decide as to who'll be the first
to conduct the procession of the Goddess.
Otherwise, it'll we
a contentious issue.
There'll be a quarrel if you so decide
otherwise, why should it ensue.
At least keep God aloof from
your animosities.
Okay, Shakti, I'll make a move.
Vinay, come home since you've come
so far. - Have some refreshments.
Some other time Mr. Thakur
I've an urgent meeting today, okay.
Father about the dam...
- Mr. Collector. - Go back...
I've to discuss with you an important
matter. - Please tell me.
The dam near the village
has become very old.
It requires urgent repairs.
The wall on the western side
has developed even cracks.
Anything can happen any time.
Your officers come...
Inspect & go away.
But they don't do any tangible thing.
Please get some thing done.
I'll talk to the Minister
about it today itself.
Okay Greeting. - Greetings.
What is Shakti's plan?
- Chain of restaurants.
I'm trying to open some
kind of chain of restaurants.
I mean fast food restaurants.
I've to Cajole father.
Okay. - Okay wish you all
the best. - Thanks.
She won't listen. I had told you
not to play in the rain.
Suppose you catch old,
have fever...
That brat has hardly
come few days ago.
And the matters have swung
in their favour.
They're not swung
he has manipulated them.
Huts of our people were burnt
what did you do?
Burning of huts is a crime under the law
& I can prove it.
At the moment I don't
remember its section.
If you don't remember
then disappear from here.
They've brunt our huts.
We'll burn theirs.
During rains, fire doesn't
kindle, it extinguishes.
You are right father.
Water extinguishes the fire,
we'll respond to their fire with water.
Take it, take it.
Hey why are the goats so restless.
I'll go & check.
Laxmi, find out whether uncle
has returned or not?
Who is it?
Who is it? Why don't speak up.
Where are you running?
What are you people doing here?
What's happening? What's this noise?
What's this noise? - Come lets
go & check it... Come...
Run...
Dam has broken...
Dam has broken, entire
village'll get submerged.
Junior boss we're ruined.
Whose child is this? Whose child is this?
Whose child is this?
My Munna.
My child has died...
My child... has died...
Save us...
You!
You're that one, you've broken
the dam you've killed my Munna.
I'll not leave you. You've killed
my Munna, I'll kill you...
You've broken the dam you've
killed by Munna.
I'll not leave you.
You've killed my Munna...
Here is the criminal,
& I am the witness.
Thank you.
Get up.
Who else was there besides you.
- No one else was there sir.
I was alone sir,
I had put the gun-powder.
Bloody creep 5 people were seen there.
Where're the rest 4 tell me.
Believe me sir, no one
else was there.
Tell me otherwise... - I told you sir,
no one else was there.
Greetings from Balli Thakur
Mr. Inspector- Greetings.
You're one of those few who
received greetings from Balaram.
Mr. Lawyer.
Here is his bail application.
He can't be bailed out- Why.
Because he has confessed his crime
that he blew up the dam.
Hey bloody fool. What was the
need of confessing.
And that too so soon.
We never knew that we were throwing
crumbs to such a murderer.
Otherwise we wouldn't have even
thought of bailing him out.
Rascal's like you should
be punished.
The one thought that is nagging me,
Is about your wife & children.
Who'll take care of them?
Who will tell me.
Okay. We'll look after them.
Why're you rooted to the ground
let's go- Yes... Yes.
Junior boss, Balli Thakur's comments
are to be deeply pondered.
"I'll take care of his children".
It doesn't mean this but that.
Now it's very difficult to
get information from him.
All your labour has gone waste.
Labour is never wasted.
If one criminal is punished. Other'll be
deterred from committing a crime.
Villagers will have
faith in justice.
What more do I want beyond this?
I couldn't bear their grief,
that's why I took a little...
You also have it.
As you like.
Did you eat. - No.
Why? - I don't feel like it.
Do you see that woman.
She is the same mother
who lost her child.
Even then she is eating.
Do you know why? So that she can take
care of her other child.
A man has to keep alive
to help others.
Mr. Accountant... - 1, 2, 3, 4...
Coming sir.
When is my ticket booked for.
- For tomorrow.
Please cancel it.
If we cancel tomorrow's ticket...
Next reservation'll be very
difficult. Festivals are in vogue.
Doesn't matter. - But.
Father, I'm not going.
Mr. Accountant cancel... - Cancel.
Can I get a little salt?
Faithless person. To hell with
your advocacy.
You couldn't bail out a man.
Junior Thakur, he could've
been bailed out...
This time I've memorized all
the sections also.
But that Dhania ruined
all my efforts.
Reversal doesn't take long. You
don't worry. Next deal will be ours.
Do we have to stay put
till the next deal.
We are Thakurs we
prefer death to defeat.
Let your enemies face death.
This time I'll take the
recourse to a section,
By which our crime
will not be proved,
And senior Thakur will
jump in such a manner.
As if some one had poured
boiling oil on his feet.
How?
What is the weak point
of senior Thakur?
What is it?
What is it?
Grief of the villagers.
Greetings.
What's the problem?
Boss, without any provocation they
started putting the fence.
When we asked Narayan the
lawyer started quoting the law.
Boss, if this way is blocked,
then we poor farmers will suffer a lot.
We'll have to take the
circuitous route via "Kasharpur",
to the vegetable market.
And it will night when
we reach there.
Next day who'll buy our
stale vegetables & fruits.
This way our children
will starve & die.
Father, shall I go & take care of them
...First take care of yourself.
Sir you don't go there alone.
All of you stay here.
Shakti come.
Hey lawyer.
Oh senior Thakur,
respectful greetings...
What's all this?
This!
The legal owner of this land wanted
to protect his property.
From trespass transgression
hence fence.
Look we're not concerned with
your intentions & modalities.
But we like to know what legal
right you've,
to say that a fence is required.
Now you are satisfied listening
to English. Now speak in Hindi.
Or you don't know Hindi.
No such things.
National language, long live.
The owner of this land wanted to fence it
so I got it done.
The owner of this land is Narayan.
And I gave this land to Narayan.
Narayan? Is this fence put up
with your consent?
No boss, these people...
When Ghana's mother was sick Narayan
mortgaged this land to Balli Thakur.
Even now the papers
are with Balli Thakur.
Father it seems they've taking
advantage of Narayan's helpless.
They're using the legal thumbscrew.
We'll take this case to the court.
Why to the court?
Disputes of this village
aren't settled by the court.
But by the village assembly.
Narayan tomorrow morning at 7.
Be present in the village assembly.
Let's go.
We got a bit late.
'Not a bit'. You are late
exactly by 1 hour.
Thakur is not governed by time, time
it governed by Thakur.
Please start village headman.
You start sir.
Is this village assembly or
an assembly of misconduct.
Members we don't have time
to waste, come to the point.
Yes we must talk about the point.
Point is that on the entire land of this
village. Each farmer has the same right.
As every son has on his mother.
I would like to ask Narayan that
on what grounds,
he has stopped the
passage of the villagers.
That passage which is for the
improvement of the villagers,
That passage which is
for their well-being.
That passage which is their life-line.
I saw Narayan going to-wards
Kasharpur in the morning.
I'll give a reply to
this & not Narayan.
This is the power of attorney
given to me by Narayan.
His thumb impression
is there on it.
I don't accept this power
of attorney.
It doesn't have the impression
of his willingness.
But the impression of his helplessness.
And to take advantage forcibly
of someone's helplessness.
And to present it as
legal evidence.
This is a very convenient ruse
these days, village head.
In my opinion, this piece
of paper has no relevance.
Members of the assembly,
how do you view this.
A piece of paper,
or legal document?
In view of we assembly members.
The real reason for this dispute,
is the animus between the
senior and junior Thakur.
Welfare of the village lies,
in the compromise of
both the brothers.
Senior Thakur. Would you
like to comment on this.
Village head. Entire village knows that
I'm not averse to compromise.
I am prepared to compromise even
today. But on one condition.
That fence has to be
removed from there.
In return, I'm prepared to
pay any price.
We're not starving, to feed
ourself by selling the land.
This case will be decided not by
the village assembly but by the court.
Till date no Thakur of Joshpura
has stepped in the court.
Nor he'll ever.
Thakurs don't accept a girl
his daughter-in-law.
Who, before marriage, Come to the
in-law's place & celebrate nuptials.
Uncle.
This is our personal affair, father.
Raising it in the village assembly...
- You keep quite.
There is a limit to everything.
I'll not allow them to
character assassinate a decent girl.
Foreign return is a hot
tempered person, Balli.
Beware uncle. - I told you
to keep quiet.
For the last time I'll request
the village assembly.
To give their verdict.
Why are you referring to
village assembly all the time.
As if a street dog is barking.
Balli! - Junior boss...
What will be the difference
between them & us.
Members. This impertinent is talking
nonsense & you're keeping quiet.
What are you doing?
Listen Balram. I wanted the
village assembly to decide.
Because I had placed
them in high esteem.
But I never thought that I've
come to a wrong place.
I've no respect here.
Nobody has regards for me here.
Let's go Shakti, let's go.
I can't stay with these brutes
even for a moment.
You're running away from the
battle field cowards.
At least blacken your face.
Hold you tongue Balli,
hold your tongue. - Come.
The game has started only now.
See what happens in the future.
What the hell. - Let's go.
You may be able to tolerate father
but I can't.
I'll kill that bastard
I'll kill him...
Hey, you foreign returned.
Have you left behind your valour
what'll happen to your miss.
They want bloodshed in
the village assembly.
I don't want the car.
They're provoking us.
Remove this.
Boss what'll we do now?
Don't ask me. I want to distance
myself from your tumults.
I'm fed up, relieve me.
What to do and what not to do?
I know nothing.
You just order boss.
I'll chop the heads of those
rascals & place them at your feet.
Hey, you shut up. A great one
to chop their heads!
Always blabbering.
Yes father. - You were right.
These people can't think of
anything else except violence.
You wanted to go, didn't you? Go...
If you stay amidst these animals,
You'll also become one like them.
You cool down father
I don't want to go anywhere.
You wanted to start that
that uncouth thing...
Tea shop... Go and open that.
Take out of them with you
fix them in some jobs.
Those people won't let them live. They
won't allow them to cultivate peacefully.
They fight amongst themselves & die.
Don't be distressed father...
You've lost your discretion in anger.
What nonsense are you talking
Why should I be angry?
Only that man gets angry.
Who has shame, modesty, self esteem.
What do I have?
That impertinent brat
has neutralized all of it.
In a jiffy, leave me...
Father... Father... take care...
- Nothing has happened to me.
I'm perfectly alright. All of you go
from here. Leave me alone.
Grandpa are you angry?
No child, my body is paining.
Then you sleep grandpa
I'll press you. - No, I'll press.
No, I'll press. - No, I'll press.
My children, your grandpa's
body is quite big.
All of you can jointly, press it.
Then you lie down. - Alright.
Will you sing a song for grandpa.
- Which one grandpa?
About the king...
"He was dwelling in
everyone's heart."
Oh! You innocent girl
from the beginning.
"He was dwelling in everyone's heart".
No, I told you from the beginning.
- How grandpa?
"There was a village which"...
Yes, Bravo now all of you
sing like that.
"There was a village
which had such a king".
"He was dwelling in
everyone's heart".
There was no one like him...
Grandpa...
Mother...
Mother...
Father...
Mother... Come soon...
- See, what happened to grandpa?
Mother... Mother...
- Get up grandpa...
"Dream of the life".
"Got shattered one day".
"Closing his eyes,
he abandoned everyone".
"His memories can't be erased".
"They make us cry, they haunt us".
"It became dark as soon
as he departed".
"Everything there, says this".
Shakti, Shakti.
- What's it brother?
Letter... letter. - From whom?
- Come here.
By the fragrance,
I think it's from her.
It's from her, isn't it?
Let him read the letter.
Read loudly.
I'm angry because you informed me
about your father's death so late.
Give my love to Surkhiya
& greetings to you & sister-in-law.
Did you see that?
She cares so much about us
from now itself and you...
What happened?
Look how many hands are shaking?
You've put Surkhiya to spy on me.
He stands outside the bathroom
when I take bath.
Brother, you've promised me.
Yes Shakthi, but sometimes a peg.
- Not a drop.
It's a matter of our prestige.
Okay... Go... go... go... go...
This road is closed.
Dhania junior boss's paper has
flown away.
Bring it fast. Go & catch it quickly.
Bring it.
Greetings, junior boss.
- Greetings.
Take it.
Junior boss, I see Senior Boss
in you.
This fence has taken his life.
Bring it fast.
- Bringing father.
Junior boss. This girl is
responsible for all problems.
I'm having this land to gift it
as dowry in her marriage.
Or else I would've sold it &
left the village long back.
At least I wouldn't become a
problem for the villagers, junior boss.
The road is right in front.
But the villagers can't use it.
I'm clue less.
Greetings, junior boss.
- Greetings.
Bloody dog, rascal.
What were you talking with him
standing near the fence?
I'm putting an end to our relationship,
And you're cultivating it.
I'll cut your tongue if you
dare to talk to him again.
Get lost from here. Go.
Balli. - What's it?
- Put me in the chair.
Elder brother came in
my dreams yesterday.
He told me twice,
very affectionately.
'Birju you also come'.
He doesn't leave us alone even
after his death.
Scoundrel.
Junior boss at this time, here?
Greetings, junior boss.
Greeting Ram Narayanan uncle.
I want to talk to you.
Uncle, it's about the
welfare of the village.
What's the use of telling me,
junior boss?
If you have something to talk,
go & talk to them.
If he comes to know than,
I'll be in trouble.
Don't drag me into this
problem, for God's sake.
Even if concerns Gehna's alliance.
- About alliance.
What do you mean?
I've seen a boy of our side for her.
The boy is good in all aspects.
What about the dowry?
- Nothing.
You have to remove the fence only.
Oh God! I can't do it, junior boss.
I'll be beheaded.
I'll take the responsibility
of your head.
I swear on my father that
no harm will come to you.
Don't think that you've
become landless.
In return I'll give you the
fertile land near the canal.
Twice in area.
It's okay, but the shadow
of fear will be there.
Let's do one thing.
We'll consult Balli's mother.
Then, nothing will work out.
We've to take the decision
and right now.
Look uncle Narayanan, I trust you.
You'll never go back
on your promise.
Do you have faith me or not?
I'm the son of Raja Thakur.
I'll give my life to
keep up a promise.
Yes, you'll.
Mohan. - Yes sir.
He's the boy.
Mohan, tell uncle Narayanan that
you're ready to marry Gehna.
I'm ready, junior boss.
I'll give my life for you.
"Listen uncle & aunty"
"Listen, oh my uncle & aunty"
"Listen, oh my uncle & aunty"
"We've won the battle"
"The enemy who was a hurdle till
yesterday has lost to us"
"Gone are the days when
we lived in sorrows"
"It's a fair of joy,
let's celebrate it"
"The girl will go to husband
house as bride"
"She'll be well decorated &
swing in her imagination"
"She'll go to another place & set
her home with her husband"
"Don't know whether she'll remember
or forget us"
"But the villagers will wait for her"
"See, she has come to the
village smilingly"
Welcome the head of
village assembly.
Congratulation Narayanan.
You're happy now.
It's God's mercy.
Surkhia, bring the garland fast.
- Coming.
Are you bringing the garland now?
- This is a garland of victory. Your Victory.
You were saying something...
Priest, Is everything ready?
- Yes good morning.
Good morning Inspector.
I've put my men to guard the place.
- Thank you very much.
Mr. Account, take care of him.
- Yes sir.
I'll be back soon.
I'll just see you.
Greetings, Inspector.
The marriage is being conducted
in a grand manner in the temple.
Shakti Thakur has organised
a feast for the entire village.
The funny part is,
They've called both the music band
& the Police.
Our bullet will be fired
without a gun.
It's not against the Law to
fire a bullet without a gun.
And I can prove this in the Court.
The funniest part of this is...
I also know the sections.
Hey stop... stop. Come here.
Where are you going?
Why are you going inside?
To give this letter to the Junior boss.
Do you want to give the letter?
Go... go... I'll give it to him. Go... go...
Go... go fast...
Where's the Junior Boss?
- Sitting over there.
Junior Boss, a letter for you.
Who gave it?
- A small boy.
He was here...
Where has he gone?
What's the problems, Shakti?
You read it.
Mohan's greeting to Junior Boss.
Thanks for selecting me as the groom.
But poor people like me don't consider
ourselves fit for this marriage.
Because anyone who marries
Narayanan's daughter,
Will become the scapegoat in the
rivalry of you rich people.
May be the bride is brave enough
to risk her life.
But I'm not brave enough
to risk my life.
So, I'm breaking my promise &
leaving the village
I am going to the city.
Did you see that, Junior Boss?
How much tyranny you've
done to father & daughter.
The entire village knows,
That my daughter is getting
married to Mohan.
But that rascal run away
from the village.
I've lost my honour.
My daughter's life has been ruined.
Have courage Uncle Narayanan.
How to be courageous?
I removed the fence on your advice.
I've made Balli Thakur my
enemy for my entire life.
It's our lives which is in danger.
Mr. Accountant- Yes, Junior boss.
Go & bring Nathu.
Tell him to come immediately.
Uncle Narayanan, this marriage will be
conducted today.
I won't get my daughter married to
any man roaming on the street.
Because, if he too writes
a letter & flees from village, then?
I made a grave mistake
by believing you.
I must slipper my self.
Why're you crying at your fate,
let's go...
You're very unfortunate.
No one asked my consent.
You all made a decision.
If my mother was alive,
I wouldn't have been in this situation.
It's a house without a woman.
That's why, I'm in this precarious situation
Now I'll die.
I'll drown myself in
some well or pond.
Why only you?
Whom should I live for?
Anyway Baljit Thakur will
never leave me alive.
Come, let's go.
Uncle Narayanan, stop.
What'll happen if I stop?
Uncle Narayanan, let's think
and find a way out.
What's there left to think?
Junior boss, answer my
only question.
You said that you're
son of Raja Thakur.
And you'll sacrifice your life
to keep up a promise.
What happened to your promise?
Our lives are in danger.
Listen.
You don't have to be
afraid of anyone.
Police will protect you.
Sir, if police had given
proper protection,
Why would these
atrocities happen?
Let's go.
Stop uncle Narayanan.
I accept that I made a
grave mistake.
I was foolish to sacrifice others
lives for the sake of villagers.
I didn't invite you & your
daughter here to get insulted.
I didn't remove the fence
to keep my head high.
And to put Balli down.
My only goal is villager's happiness.
I'm the son of Raja Thakur.
And I'll sacrifice my life
to keep up my promise.
I didn't lie.
Your mother is dead.
That's why, you're in unenvious state.
And no one asked for your
approval, isn't it?
But don't think like that?
I'm asking you.
Do you've any objection
in marrying me?
Tell me.
Junior Boss, what can
this poor girl say?
Luck has smile don her.
Dear, touch his feet.
"Enlighten your hubby's home."
"You become the lamp of
love & brighten his life."
"Be with your hubby in times
of sorrows or happiness"
"Our blessings are with you"
May your marriage
be successful on bride.
Are you our new aunty?
My uncle has married
you only, hasn't he?
Will you give us those flowers?
Enough. Don't trouble her.
Let your aunty come inside.
Come inside.
Milk.
No need.
You must drink, it's the custom.
You should've left something
for me too.
It's a custom.
I drank fully.
It's alright.
Sit down.
Did he drink the entire milk? - Yes.
He has studied in a foreign country.
So, he doesn't know about
customs & traditions.
What happened then?
Then... this happened...
Anita, how'll
make you understand...
He thinks about her very much.
Don't lose heart.
You're so cute that Shakti
will forget her very soon.
Go & make tea for him.
If he doesn't like the tea
prepared by me!
You prepare it.
No, you prepare it.
You must know about his likes
dislikes & everything else.
Now, you must take care of him.
Understood?
Go & make tea.
Greeting Junior Boss.
Registered letter for you.
Anita is coming on 14th. - Okay.
Don't forget to send the car
to the station. - Okay, sir.
Junior boss... Junior boss.
When did you see?
- Approximately one hour earlier.
Sister-in-law, when did
brother go out?
He went early morning.
He said that he's going the farm.
What's the matter? - Nothing.
Be ware!
Balli Thakur, come out quickly.
Look Shakti Thakur,
I don't know anything.
I'm just a Lawyer.
And I can prove that in the court.
What's all this, brother?
I didn't drink.
They forced me to drink.
What're you doing?
You're selling our father's dream
and not his property.
Property?
No.
These people told that
it's a letter.
No, I said nothing.
I'm ready to promise on Geetha.
Take my brother.
Balli, look at me & recognize me.
I was also born in this land.
I've grown up by eating the
same food what you eat.
The animal which is active in you,
is lying dormant in me.
Don't ever try to activate it.
It's neither good for you
nor for me.
Greetings madam.
Hasn't Shakti come?
No, he's at home.
Take the luggage.
Why didn't Shakti come?
- He had some work.
What've you done to yourself.
For a second, I felt that your
father was standing in front of me.
I'm sorry, he was a great man.
- Thanks... Come.
Sister-in-law, don't cry.
Don't cry.
Come.
Hi Surkhiya.
...You...
Boss... boss...
You lost your hand
because of me, isn't it.
This one... No one can change the fate.
But, you're alright, aren't you.
There's lot more power
in one hand.
Hi rangoli girl, how're you?
Did you get the photographs?
Did you get the photographs? - Yes.
What're you doing here?
Get something for us to drink.
Tea or Juice. - Tea.
She's from the opposite camp.
What's she doing here?
Anything new?
I know why you're
upset with me.
You're angry because I didn't
come before, isn't it?
You sent the telegram that
your father expired after 4 days.
You didn't even write whether
I should come here or not.
Why did you do like that?
Why did you do that?
Tell me, where did I go wrong?
Situation. - Bullshit situation.
You too loved me, didn't you?
Or were you already in love with her?
Then, why did you do like this?
Loved me, but married her.
Tell me.
Whom do you love? Answer me.
I love this village.
So, you sacrificed my life for that
without asking me.
What right do you've to do that?
- Nothing.
Why the hell... - Abuse me.
Curse, it's your the right.
This photo is true.
And I love you.
This also is true.
Out of these two, one
has to be a lie.
You've gone too far away from me
a short period.
I can never be pardoned for what
has happened to you.
So I won't even ask you
to forgive me.
By marrying Gehna,
I've not only made a bond with
Gehana, but also with this village.
It's my duty to take care of
both of them.
She married me without saying a word.
This one reason is enough for me not
to hurt her faith.
When I can't make you understand
what's in my heart,
I don't know whether I can
make her understand or not.
Whatever it's, this is the truth.
Gehna is my wife &
will be my wife forever.
Who's that?
It's me...
Tea.
Your Gehna.
Your village.
Everything is yours.
Except me.
But this is also true that I love you.
And it'll be always such.
I'm going. - Where?
Somewhere... to daddy's place.
- There's no train now.
So what? I'll go by walk.
I'll die.
I won't die.
I'll live & love you all my life.
This is your punishment.
Don't try to convince me.
I won't get convinced.
Right? - Right.
Right? - Right.
Right? - Right.
Right? - Right.
Right? - Wrong.
Can I get a ticket for
tomorrow's train?
Yes, I've already reserved a ticket.
I can... I can stay here
till then, can't I?
Do you need to ask this?
I've become your guest, haven't I?
Hey, what're you doing?
Get up.
Please don't take away
my husband from me.
You both are equal in Education,
riches & all other things.
I've come as a hurdle
between you both.
Name? ...Gehna.
Gehna, I'm not here to
ruin your life.
I had come here in search of my life.
I've come to know that he
no more lives here.
That's why, I'm going back.
That there's a villager hidden
inside Shakti.
Don't worry.
The Shakti whom I loved
is not this man.
The man who lives here
is your husband.
Did you keep drinking water? - Yes.
They don't sleep at 8 like us,
they'll sleep late.
Give her company.
But, don't bore her with your talk.
If she's about sleep...
Come out. - Okay.
Sit down.
Don't sit on the ground.
Sit on the chair.
It isn't his mistake,
it's a sacrifice. - What?
This...
if he hadn't married me, I & my
father would've committed suicide.
He married me to save
our lives & honour. Don't abuse him.
You make me the object of
your bitterness.
Shall I go? - Why?
I'll keep on blabbering.
I'm a villager, ain't I?
What if you get hurt
by some of my blabber.
Didn't Shakti tell you to talk to me,
till I go to sleep? Sit down.
If I keep on talking,
how'll you get sleep?
You're right.
Shall I sing a song?
Hey, don't cry.
I'll not sing.
By mistake I volunteered.
Please don't cry.
I'm not crying, I was laughing.
- Why?
Just like that.
On my fate.
Even then I'll not sing.
- Why?
No, you're laughing, if you start
crying after hearing my song?
I'm not a good singer.
I promise you, I'll not cry.
Then, shall I sing?
You can sing sitting also.
Yes, I can sit & sing.
Anklets are tinkling.
Anklets are clinking.
How sweet is this union.
Bangles jungle.
Easterly winds are whizzing past.
The sky & earth is echoing
with its sound.
These fair arms.
I extend them stealthily.
He beckons me.
And says 'listen to me'.
Enveloped in fragrance.
I walk in a trance.
I always look very beautiful to him.
The pick buds and bring them to me.
Single string instrument
plays the tune.
I'm ecstatic hearing both.
Anita, come quickly. Train will stop
here only for 2 minutes.
This is a coupe.
You'll not have any company.
You're alone.
Yes, I'm alone.
It's your kindness.
Try to forget... me and our
- Love! Etc... etc.
Can't you forget me?
Nothing is impossible if
we make a sincere try.
I'll never think about
Gehna's Shakti.
But my Shakti lives here.
I can't forget him.
I can never forget him.
What happened?
'Lispic'.
'Lispic' .
No, other person should see it,
so I tried to wipe it
without your permission.
Don't get angry with me.
I can understand. How can
these villagers understand?
If anyone passes adverse comments.
Unnecessarily your fair name
will get tarnished.
That's why...
Please, drive slowly.
You appear tensed and 'sade'.
- What?
'Tension' & 'Sade'.
Sister-in-law has advised
me to learn English.
To win your heart.
Now a days she's my teacher.
What?
I mean... forgive me.
What're you saying?
You are my God.
I'm the one who should say sorry.
It was all because of me.
Everything had happened
because of me.
Didn't I say it isn't any
attempt on my life?
It was just an accident.
You might've noticed
the lorry's number.
No.
I was more worried that
Gehna shouldn't get hurt.
Please, you don't suspect anyone
without any valid reason.
Forget it.
What happened?
Nothing dear, tumbler fell down.
Jr. Thakur, after that accident
if there's little sound,
Poor girl gets scared.
You might've got hurt.
Jr. Thakur, it's my humble request.
Wherever you might go,
please don't go alone.
Yes. - Yes... Yes...
Bye. - Bye, Jr. Boss.
Moon... moon... Distant...
- Aunty, she's beating me.
If you fight among yourselves,
I'll not tell you story tonight.
Go & play without any fights.
Coming, sister-in-law.
You sit here only.
Don't go away.
They're asking for the pickle,
please, take it out.
Slowly... slowly...
Why're you rushing in like that?
You might fracture your limbs
if you fall down.
You called me by name for the first time.
I couldn't control myself.
What do you want?
Close the door.
Look...
You're my wife.
I'm your husband.
No body can change our
relationship. Got it?
What?
Nobody can change it.
But, I need some time
to change myself.
In due course,
I'll forget all my past.
You're not angry with me, are you?
No.
You're able to understand my
problem, aren't you?
Yes.
Men... No mention sir.
Shall I go?
Why?
I'll be a disturbance to you.
What?
I don't have any problem,
please sit here.
Not there... here.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get up.
Sit down.
Why do you behave like a puppet?
This is your home.
Live as you wish.
No one will stop you.
If you need anything
feel free to ask me.
If you don't like anything
feel free to tell me.
You too feel free to tell me
if you don't like anything.
Okay.
Did you like the song?
Why?
Anita was sad, so when I volunteered
to sing for her.
She broke into laughter.
If you're sad, shall I
sing for you too?
Yes, go ahead. - Yes.
You can sing sitting also.
Yes, I can sing sitting also.
Anklets are tinkling.
Anklets are clinking
How sweet is our...
Anklets...
Only air is coming out.
Not because of this.
My voice isn't coming out.
Anklets are tinkling.
Anklets are clinking.
How sweet is our relationship.
My bangles are making sound.
Easterly wind is whizzing past.
The sky & Earth are echoing
with the sound.
Sometimes you walk fast.
Sometimes you walk slow. My heart is
troubling in love.
The river will flow.
Wind will make whizzing sound.
We are talking to each
other wasting time.
The maiden is singing melodiously.
Beloved is dancing to her tunes.
This heart is lost in love.
This girl is fair complexioned.
I'm not holding it stealthily.
Listen to me.
Please listen to me.
You're mesmerized.
You're walking in a trance.
You appear new to me every time.
Shall I bring buds selectively?
As the one stringed instrument
'EK Tara' plays.
Let's get enchanted
with that music.
Villagers believe that Goddess procession
hasn't been taken out for few years.
That's why, few untoward
incidents took place.
This year the Panchayat
has decided...
Under the supervision of
Endowment officer...
Procession of Goddess Devi
will be taken out.
And the honour of Chief Guest will
go to Raja Thakur's family.
Why Raja Thakur's family?
Because, he's elder.
On what basis.
On the basis of who are alive.
Or on the basis of dead people.
Amongst living persons
he's not the elder.
And the statues of the dead
has to be determined in heaven.
Why're you using that
yardstick here?
Is it to enable him to feel
victorious in front of the villagers.
And make us the losers.
Balli, don't excited &
talk irrelevantly.
The festival is being arranged
for the well being of the entire village.
What relevance, victory
and defeat has in this.
My real victory will on the day when this
divided village unites.
I'm not interested in becoming
the Chief Guest.
You be the chief guest.
I accept you're elder to me.
Balli's days are not so bad to
pick up crumbs thrown by you.
You can't win over
Balli so easily.
In near future, I'll behead you.
Or else I'm not a Thakur.
Hey, stop blabbering.
Which is more important
to be a Thakur or human?
In near future neither you'll be
a Thakur nor a human,
Just a dead body... dead body.
This is my challenge.
I'm also challenging you.
Never trouble the villagers.
Has the beast inside you waken up?
No...
And never try to wake it up.
Before that happens your head will
roll on the earth.
Come. - Let's go.
Balli Thakur, wait. Next year
you'll get the chance.
for next year.
Don't know what'll happen
in between. Come on boys.
Enough of your make up.
Come out quickly.
People will come to see the
Goddess not you.
Moving the Goddess chariot is easier
than moving women away from mirror.
Has Surkhia come.
- He might've... he'll be outside.
Mother said she'll come just now.
Aunty's health isn't good.
She's vomiting number of times.
Didn't mother say not
to tell them.
Gehna's health is not good?
Nothing wrong, she's fine.
She might've eaten something.
A days' fast will set
right everything.
Oh! No! Got it?
Come... come... come.
- But, why is she vomiting?
You've absolutely dumb.
Inspite of being father of 3 children yet.
Is it Inspector speaking?
No, he has gone out.
What? Gone out? - Oh God!
I want to tell him about
an important matter.
But, who are you?
I'm Birju Thakur speaking.
What's so important to
talk with the Inspector?
Don't do it. It'll lead
to destruction.
Yes Balli, listen to him.
Listen to him.
Stop, Balli. Stop... stop.
It'll be a disaster.
Who're you to stop me
from pulling the rope?
Do you know who I'm?
What's going on?
Move away & let me go.
- What's going on here?
Call the son of Raja Thakur,
the junior boss. I want to talk to him.
What's the matter? Why're you upset?
- I don't want to talk to you.
Call the junior boss.
- What did you say?
Call the junior boss.
Why're you shouting?
I'm Raja Thakur's son.
Tell me, what's the matter?
You... Shakti.
My dear, you've grown up so big.
I couldn't recognise you.
How could you recognise me?
I'm Satho Aunty.
I fed you on my lap.
- Oh, are you Satho Aunty!?
Balli's baby sitter,
I used to feed you.
Yes, but what's the problem?
Look my dear, I've come from a long
distance to pull the rope.
They're not allowing me to go.
- It's such a simple issue.
Yes. Okay, come with me.
- Hey, move.
Come... come.
Stand here... stand here.
No one will bother me, isn't it?
No one will question you.
If someone hits me & pushes me down.
No one will push you.
This is my place.
What?
This is my place. No one will push you.
- You gave me your place. I'll go now.
May Goddess bless with a long life.
Stand here confidently.
No one will ever question you.
Surkhiya, what're you doing here, come.
- I'm coming. - Come... come.
I'm satisfied the moment
I hold this rope.
All my sins are washed. I've attained
salvation. Hail the Goddess!
Nanny... Nanny!
Where's Balli?
Balli is not here, Shakti.
He has ran away leaving
us all to die.
Now you do anything you
want to do with us.
Kill us all. Behead us... Behead us.
- Yes son.
Anyway the villagers won't leave us alive.
It better to die at your hands.
Kill her... - Mother...
Kill her.
Kill them... Kill them.
Don't spare anyone.
Find each one & kill them.
Open the door.
They've locked the door & staying
inside. Open the door.
Send the traitors out.
Let them be your relatives, never mind.
We'll burn them alive.
Blood for blood. For how long
will this continue?
How long?
Go away from here. Go.
If you still want to
take revenge,
I'm here infront of you.
Remove me from your path.
And turn Raja Thakur's Palace
into a cauldron of death.
Attention all villagers.
Because of the bomb blast during
chariot procession...
On Collector's orders
Section 144 has been clamped.
If in any public place in the village,
Balli Thakur or Shakti Thakur's men
or assembly of others groups
is prohibited.
Violators of this order
will be arrested.
Why did you come here?
Police is searching for you
in every nook & corner.
You go away from here.
You go away.
I'm not a coward like your husband
to hide in a burrow.
Shit eater pigs of the enemy.
I'm here to cut that dogs head.
And your's & your husbands too.
- I'll not let it happen, Balli.
You can't take any more lives.
So you've come.
Today not even your angels
can save you from me.
I do what I say.
Take it.
Pick it up.
What're you looking at?
Either of us should live after today.
There has already been too much of
bloodshed, Balli.
Why're you thirsting for
more blood?
If I commit one murder or 100 murders.
I'll be hanged only once.
To behead you, I'm waiting here
without food & water.
Pick it up.
Why've you become
a blood thirsty beast?
If I allow my wife to spend
a night under your roof,
Then spit on my manhood.
- Balli, be ashamed of yourself.
You're my elder brother.
Your wife is my sister-in-law.
Pick up the weapon, you eunuch!
God who has saved our lives,
are you going to take his life?
No. Don't do like that. - Move away.
Aunty...
Aunty, Balli look!
- Balli, don't do like that.
Aunty, stay away. Stay away aunty.
- Bloody Thakur.
Has the beast inside you died?
You eunuch!
Have you seen a messenger of death?
Look at me.
I'm the messenger of death.
- No.
No Balli, listen to you mother.
Don't go mad with rage.
Kill him. It's better that I don't have
such a son.
Balli, come to the police station.
Police is searching for you.
Even the villagers are also
thirsting for your blood.
Come, aunty.
Balli stop.
Balli... stop Balli.
Now, wake up the beast inside you.
Why don't you wake it up.
Wake it up. Wake it up.
You've made me also a killer.
You've made me also a killer.
I was telling you not to wake
the beast inside me.
I was telling you to surrender
yourself to the police.
It's good.
You've done a good deed.
You've done a great service
to the entire village.
I'll take the blame of the murder.
Give me the axe.
You go away. - Go away before the
police arrives here.
Go away, boss... Go away, boss.
- Where can I go?
I'll take care.
Where can I run away
from my conscience?
Where'll I go running away
from my conscience? - No boss.
I'm a murderer. - No boss
I'm a murderer.
Listen to me, boss. - Entire village
is ready to take the blame of murder.
You've taken blame for
too many murders.
You've done too many sacrifices.
- Boss, give me the axe.
Stop this blood shed.
Enemity of brothers!
- Boss... please don't go away.
Stay united.
Educate your children.
I beg you. - Stop this bloodshed.
Boss...
Love everyone.
Live as brothers
