COTE D'AZUR
In my grandma's garden in HoIIand,
I was sure she had a weII.
I was positive. I couId describe it.
I saw it so cIearIy.
The bricks, the coping, the bucket,
the tuIips aII around...
But no. There was no weII.
They fiIIed it in?
It had never been there.
Like your castIe.
We couIdn't see it from the road.
We can't see it here.
But you imagined it was there.
I can see it, Beatrix.
The coastIine, the rocks,
the sea and the castIe.
ExactIy Iike here.
There.
Yes, there.
The pine trees have grown.
In 25 years, they've had time to grow.
It's behind the pine trees, Marc.
Behind the trees.
Stupid asshoIe!
Cut it out! Wat's going on?
CharIy's a pain!
She's a pain.
She's Ieaving tomorrow...
She can sIeep somewhere eIse.
He can wait.
Hey, we're on vacation!
So kindIy work this out
without screaming!
Laura, give CharIy the room.
CharIy can do the dishes tonight.
Any comments?
Perfect!
As my grandma used to say,
aII's weII that ends...
...weII.
Look at that coIor...
We have to eat stuff Iike that
on the Riviera?
You don't have to.
It's an opportunity.
It's fuII of iodine. It's heaIthy.
You can't get violets in Paris.
It's been years.
Maybe it's Iike your castIe.
You dreamed it was deIicious
but it's ordinary.
Or even gross.
Wat?
It's good. I toId you.
It reminds you of something?
Of course.
Anything specific?
No, just things...
Forgotten sensations.
It reminds me I hate raw things.
Don't get me started!
You're outdoing each other
in regression?
It's reaIIy good.
Do we have some Iemon or pepper?
Pepper, that's it.
They need some seasoning.
Leave us some hot water!
It's crazy how teens today
Iove to scrub.
Wen I came here, I'd forget.
That's gross!
It's cIeaner here.
I Iiked the taste of saIty skin.
Come on,
you're not rationing hot water?
It's not just the hot water.
Wen you wash too often,
you get skin probIems.
Everyone knows that.
And wasting water Iike that
is bad for the pIanet.
Okay, I get it.
From now on, no more showers.
You're so excessive.
Moderation is aII we ask.
Dad, what's with the hot water?.
At the station.
It's my dad's fauIt.
The weather is great.
Like violets?
They're weird. Soft and purpIe.
I mean yeIIow.
You've grown.
- How Iong has it been?
-Ayear.
Think I've changed?
You've...
SuddenIy I reaIize CharIy has...
Come on, Dad.
Got nothing better to taIk about?
I hope you don't Iive
in the shower too.
Wow, you've grown!
Dad's aIready said that.
If everything's been said,
we can sIeep easy!
You know where the sheets are.
Separate rooms?
You can have mine.
You get the best view.
Thanks.
I guess you're right.
It's safer this way.
I'm on the other side of the Ianding.
Do you mind keeping the sheets?
I sIept in them one night
and I behaved myseIf.
Be right back.
CharIy's not here?
He's moving into his room.
His room?
Wat's that about the shower?
Nothing.
I was jerking off in the shower.
They were pissed
because I used aII the hot water.
Your dad toId me not to jerk off?
No, stupid. He doesn't know
I jerk off in the shower.
He thinks I spend
too Iong in the shower.
Maybe he's smarter than you think.
Everyone jerks off in the shower.
ReaIIy? You too?
Sometimes.
It's not my favorite spot.
I prefer the toiIets at schooI.
WAnt to try?
I'II tighten the chain.
It'II be fine.
We're going for a waIk.
Back for Iunch?
Of course.
Ever think CharIy couId be gay?
Gay?
Wat do you think?
I don't know.
Were did this come from?
Seeing him with Martin,
it was Iike a reveIation.
SuddenIy it aII made sense.
Wat?
You're crazy.
How was it?
Freezing.
Good Iuck. You'II need it.
It's the sea breeze.
The water's much coIder in PortugaI.
I'm not going there to swim!
First up,
CharIy's never brought a girI home.
CamiIIe.
He was in primary schooI.
Second...
I don't know. It's so obvious.
Martin is his boyfriend.
They've had no contact for a year.
That's just it.
At their age, they onIy fight
for sentimentaI reasons.
CharIy pIays soccer!
Third,
and this is the reaI argument
CharIy and Martin
are sIeeping in separate rooms.
Kids never do that,
unIess they're hiding something.
That's totaIIy ridicuIous.
ReIax!
It's sunny, this house is divine,
CharIy's gay. Wat's the probIem?
It's easier to take
than if I said he wasn't yours.
The newspaper says more and more
young peopIe have AIDS.
Wat's with you?
I read it this morning.
Since nobody's taIking,
I thought I'd bring it up.
It's important, right?
Not reaIIy.
You're wrong.
AIDS concems you. Be carefuI.
Your sexuaIity's fine with me.
Be free but protect yourseIves.
Cut it out.
Are you the schooI nurse?
Afree rubber with every
Band-Aid!
With their middIe-aged Iust...
So your advice...
I can never taIk seriousIy with you two.
Martin's more aduIt.
You take precautions, I hope.
Marc, Ieave Martin aIone.
You're making him uncomfortabIe.
Not at aII.
Wy be uncomfortabIe?
We can taIk freeIy about sex, right?
SeriousIy, Dad,
the Iiberated, caring act
is not your styIe.
He was over the top about AIDS.
He thinks we sIeep together.
That bothers you?
No, not reaIIy.
In fact, it's pretty funny.
HopefuIIy, it pisses him off.
No, it wouId be good.
Yourfather's nice.
You treat him Iike a bIockhead.
He's my dad, that's aII.
He gets on my nerves.
It's not Iike you think,
a ''coming out''.
Awhat?
Coming out of the cIoset.
Wat cIoset?
It's a poetic image.
It means not hiding anymore,
reveaIing your homosexuaIity.
My mother...
She cried a IittIe,
forform's sake.
I think she's reaIIy happy.
My dad acted Iike nothing happened.
You have rich kid probIems!
It's weird.
It's freezing.
It's not normaI.
It's because of the sea breeze.
You get used to it.
Don't go on about it!
I was heavy-handed, okay.
Agay son, a daughter on a sexscapade
in PortugaI and I can't warn them?
- Wat's a dad for?
- You're right.
But you were pushing CharIy
to spiII the beans.
You made him uncomfortabIe.
If he hasn't toId us,
he feeIs the time's not right.
Maybe he pIans
a more theatricaI ''coming out''.
Awhat?
MichaeI's here.
Are you ready?
Have a coffee before you go.
We'II stop on the way.
Kiss kiss!
That guy's ass...
I never noticed he had such a hot ass.
Wat's with women and bikers?
He mounts his bike so...
You're both ridicuIous, not me.
You're not ridicuIous.
Just a reaI father.
It's the first time I've...
reaIized...
so cIearIy.
Your daughter sIeeps with men.
At her age, it's normaI.
You have to get used to it.
It was reaIIy awfuI.
So I stopped bringing girIs home
and I don't taIk about them.
You're surprised they think you're gay!
You're so shy,
it's easy to get it wrong.
I got sucked in.
I'm not the onIy one.
Take EIise, for exampIe.
You toId her I'm not?
I won't Iet you sIeep with her.
Come off it! She's so ugIy.
You have no eye for girIs.
I think she's cooI.
Of course she's not...
instantIy stunning, but...
I'm not Iike you make out.
Don't get me wrong.
Breasts are important.
FIat girls don't turn me on.
At the same time,
girls with huge breasts
are reaIIy intimidating.
I don't know why.
Maybe it's because they're sexier.
You Iistening?
Sorry, not reaIIy.
Breasts don't do it for me.
Check out that guy.
Wat about him?
WAke up!
He's cruising.
Give me a break!
He's out for a waIk, Iike us.
It's the best spot around.
Then he's cruising.
Fags aIways choose the best spot.
You're not overdoing it a IittIe?
Not finished yet?
Bikes are the worst.
Cars are so much simpIer.
I'd rather go for a waIk too.
Do you Iike it here?
Yes, thanks. It's great.
Were did you go?
We took a path, further up.
There are rocks,
a nice view.
It Iooks over the sea.
Ever been to the fort?
Rubbers everywhere. It's gross.
But it means safe sex
is aIive and weII.
I'II get back to my bike.
But you want him to think you're gay?
Yeah, but no.
No need to Iay it on so thick.
Don't Iook so embarrassed
when he asks where you went.
If he's decided you're gay,
he'II see signs everywhere.
Forget it.
This is insane.
How can peopIe think I'm gay?
SeriousIy!
You're too cute to be straight.
I think it's time you came out.
Don't worry so much.
Let things happen.
My mind's a bIank.
Liar!
You were thinking about Charly.
Maybe. It wasn't conscious.
Your chiIdren's sexuaIity bothers you.
You shouId stop thinking about it.
And stop trying
to taIk to them about it.
Stick to cars?
You didn't have a Dutch mother.
Wen we taIked about sex,
it came naturaIIy.
You can't. You get tense.
It's not yourfauIt.
It's about upbringing,
Ieaming to be toIerant.
Sometimes I think
you're too toIerant.
That proves you don't get it.
You can't be ''too toIerant''.
Either you are or you're not.
I'm teIIing you,
forget it.
Listen.
''The erect,
fuII-bodied femaIe panicIes
''contrast with the thin,
mangy maIe panicIes.''
Interesting...
Yes, Mathieu.
I'm on my bicycIe
on a deIightfuI IittIe road.
And you?
Wat?
At the station, of course.
Where are you?
I'm not angry.
Just a IittIe surprised.
I can't see you.
Do you Iike violets?
AsheIIfish.
They're soft and purpIe.
I mean yeIIow.
Not reaIIy yeIIow.
If I understand,
you're pIanning...
to spend your vacation here.
Let's say,
part of it.
Here with you.
If you want, I can Ieave.
Spare me the bIind...
devotion.
Let's just say I find
the situation...
a IittIe...
tacky.
I don't want to spend my time
inventing stratagems to fooI Marc.
It's degrading, isn't it?
Wat's so different here?
At home,
Marc deaIs with his customers.
I aIways have a reason
to Ieave the garage.
At home, you fit into my scheduIe...
I'II make sure I fit in.
Maybe.
But then we'II faII into a routine
and vacations
are meant to break routines.
You want me to Ieave?
Not reaIIy.
I'm trying to find a way
to make you a summer Iover.
A romantic Iover...
You have it aII wrong.
Josette was a very beautifuI,
inteIIigent woman.
At 70, she stiII turned men's heads.
She had Iovers.
That's so absurd, you can't imagine.
Not as sad as imagining
a 101-year-oId virgin.
She had some crazy ideas
but one huge fauIt.
She was stingy.
That changes everything.
Nothing couId be Iess sexy.
So she was a woman...
In need of a fuck?
Since my grandfather couIdn't pay,
she shut us out.
She even disinherited my grandma.
So how come you inherited?
My grandparents died ages ago.
We were Josette's onIy famiIy.
She changed herwiII.
It was a surprise when she died.
It's a sad story reaIIy.
She ended up here aII aIone...
with her avarice.
AII aIone...
She had a nurse?
Wat are you suggesting now?
Everyone's had a shower?
I'm emptying the tank!
I can't hear you.
This is no time to caII.
WAit, the network's better
in the garden!
You're not going out?
It's Iate, so it must be important.
It shouId get through here.
It's getting through.
Show you a good time?
Okay but make it quick.
This is not in my caII pIan.
Wo was it?
Christiane.
Wat did she teII you?
Her Iife story, again.
She's so in Iove.
It's important.
To keep you taIking for an hour
at midnight?
It wasn't an hour. Come on!
You're freezing.
Wat time is it?
Go back to sIeep. It's pouring.
No big deaI.
We'II be stuck indoors.
It's nice being bored on vacation.
On the beach in summer's glare
Shellfish, shellfish everywhere
So pretty
Basking in a bikini
Nonchalantly, languidly
On the beach fast asleep
Shellfish, shellfish, hard to beat
With no ado
We'll gather one or two
Shellfish are so good for you
Listening to the same refrain
Singing songs with dubious rhymes
Spouting nonsense yet again
Coming out with dirty lines
I'm going to take a shower.
At noon?
Wy not?
UnIess...
How about a jerk off contest?
With you?
Not with my dad!
Listen, CharIy.
That's fine
in the Iocker rooms after soccer,
but don't try it on me, okay?
For me, your cock...
Your cock, your baIIs, your ass...
Go take a shower!
Think of me when you jerk off?
Less often now.
I'm sorry.
Sun's out.
WAnt to get a drink?
I'II take the yeIIow baIIs.
Were does my hand go?
I hit any oId baII.
It's no big deaI.
You're in schooI?
I'm in senior year, accounting.
I passed aII my finaI exams.
- I'm happy.
- CongratuIations.
I'm a senior too, in Iiterature.
I'm waiting for my exam resuIts.
I'II hit them both.
Maybe one wiII go in.
Try to bIast the red one.
You were tied up.
I'm getting some air.
I can't taIk Iouder.
I don't know where I am.
Listen, get off my case.
Take a shower and go to bed.
Wat can I say?
I can't come back now.
I'II caII you back.
Shit!
Nothing. I'm on my way.
I'm drowning my sorrows in pastis.
WAnt one?
I'II take a hot shower if I can.
Outdoor fucking has its drawbacks.
WAs it fun?
If I were you, I wouIdn't push it.
You're not answering?
I don't feeI Iike it.
Get up, Iazybones!
Stop it!
Get Iost!
Get up, I'm starving.
Leave me aIone!
I can't get up right now.
I'm naked.
I've seen others.
I think you scared him.
I'm going for a waIk.
WAnt me to come?
No, you're reading.
Keep reading.
Didn't you hear the phone Iast night?
Wy didn't you answer?
Marc and I had made Iove.
I wanted to sIeep.
You two stiII make Iove?
Sometimes.
Do you Iike it?
Wen he's on form.
I'm not sure I Iike it.
ReIax, it doesn't happen often.
But yesterday...
Maybe it's the violets.
I ate some Iast night myseIf.
Two dozen.
And at Iunch?
Some wheIk.
Good.
Wat eIse?
CIams, Iobsters and scaIIops...
and winkIes.
More.
Prawns, musseIs, cockIes
and tiny periwinkIes.
Is that aII?
Sea urchins, more scaIIops...
and abaIone.
How sophisticated.
Wat eIse?
VeIvet crabs...
and scampi
and a crab, a big crab,
with mayonnaise.
Naughty boy.
Wat eIse?
Shrimp, of course.
Pink ones and gray ones.
With you I feeI Iike
a teenager misbehaving.
I feeI Iike I'm my daughter's age.
Right now, for exampIe,
I'd Iike to stuff myseIf
with sweets or cakes...
or chocoIate.
Tonight at dinner,
I wouIdn't be hungry.
I wouIdn't eat
and I'd think of you.
Wy don't you run away?
No, I don't want to.
Sneaking out, yes, or pIaying hooky.
But not running away.
I know it seems weird.
It's not a fear of change
that's hoIding me back,
or my kids.
They don't need me anymore.
It's a feeIing I have.
AfeeIing of weII-being
in this unbaIanced kind of baIance.
And I think I Iove my husband.
Were do I fit in?
You?
You have my ceII phone number.
You shouId go for a swim.
No, I'm fine.
I'm going in. I'm aII sweaty.
Come with me.
I said I don't feeI Iike it.
I don't care. I want you to come.
I never said you wanted to fuck.
You just want to be desired.
You're a tease.
You're so over the top.
You act Iike I'm some Ioony.
Not Ioony, just a tease.
I ought to know.
WAnt some?
It makes you droopy.
I Iike being aII droopy.
Shit!
Fuck it!
Wy are you aII worked up?
CharIy Ieft the shower running
and went out with Martin.
So what?
They're aIIowed out.
Why the big diversion?
I don't know.
They didn't want us to know.
WeII it backfired.
It's hardIy discreet.
A pIane!
I Iove pIanes.
PeopIe traveIIing...
You never messed up
when you were a teenager?
Tease! Yeah, sure.
I'm the tease?
Never seen you here.
Because I'm not...
From round here. No kidding.
I know everyone here...
NearIy everyone.
ReIax, I have what we need.
VaniIIa. Tempted?
Voyeurs everywhere. Come on.
You're no waIIflower.
My name's Didier. Wat's yours?
Marc.
Marc. I Iove that name.
Don't be nervous.
I'm very gentIe, you know.
Wat's your job?
PIumber.
It turns you on?
Come to my pIace.
I have handcuffs.
That's oId Josette's viIIa.
She was my great aunt.
She died this winter
at the age of 101.
AfamiIy record.
It's not that far away.
I couId waIk home.
Josette was on your dad's side?
Right. My mom's not from here.
Wat's your dad's name?
Biancheri,
Marc Biancheri.
You have the same first name?
In fact, no...
My name's Charly.
Did it hurt?
I'm reaIIy sorry.
Don't bother
with the naughty boy act.
Some peopIe wouId be pissed off.
In the end, it's for the best.
I mean it's no big deaI, reaIIy.
Get to bed and
quit going to the fort haIf-naked.
WAit, don't run off!
You'II Iove this.
You make me sick!
Fuck!
AsshoIe!
No more hot water!
The smeII got me out of bed.
There's a probIem with the hot water.
You shouIdn't have Ieft it running.
I Ieft it on?
It's okay. Your dad tumed it off.
So it's the system.
It wouId have had time to heat up.
This time, it's not my fauIt.
Sometimes I couId punch you.
Marc, what's come over you?
Insomnia is no excuse for vioIence.
Scat. Take a coId shower.
It's just what you need.
MentaI case!
What did you mean?
Wat? When?
With your coId shower?
Your son is homosexuaI, not crazy.
I never thought he was.
CoId showers
are 19th century psychiatry.
There's no hot water.
CoId water's fine.
HoId on. We'II caII a pIumber.
My train's at 10.00.
Cut out the martyr routine.
I'm naked here.
Yes but you're making progress.
No erection.
If I had even a tiny interest in guys,
I wouId have gone for it.
Nobody wouId have known!
But no.
When I was there,
it never even occurred to me.
Not at aII.
If you'd seen the oId noodIe
between my Iegs
when I feIt his big cock
against my thigh,
you'd have come
to the same concIusion.
Guys are not my thing.
I'II have to take your word for it.
They're so sweet.
Aren't they Iucky?
I don't see why.
They Iove, they fight,
they make up.
For them, everything is dramatic.
We've Iost our spark.
And I'm a Iimp dick?
I didn't mean that.
And it's not aIways true.
The violets are starting
to take effect.
Wat is it? The iodine?
It's not the sheII.
You reaIIy need some sIeep.
No, I'II keep busy.
I hate doing nothing.
I must have seemed dumb.
Sorry, I'm interrupting.
I didn't expect visitors.
Fixing something?
I need to cIear weeds.
Watever.
I Iike weeds.
Sometimes,
I have fits when I get mad.
Nothing serious.
I wasn't worried.
I nearIy punched you.
I apoIogize.
I fought with Charly and I thought...
It happens.
You know,
it's not what you think.
Charly and me...
Wat you do is none of my business.
I'm sorry.
I thought we couId taIk.
No, in fact we can't.
I'm not interested.
You teenagers are so annoying!
Mess up, it's onIy normaI.
But don't come running to us asking...
I don't know what!
I'm not Dutch, not even haIf!
I'm going for a swim.
Try it. It caIms the nerves.
Shit!
Wat an asshoIe, what a bIockhead!
Have you seen Martin?
Wy wouId I see him?
Okay, you haven't seen him.
Yes I have.
He's at the beach.
Without me?
He wanted to be aIone.
By the way, I caIIed a pIumber.
Wy?
- For the hot water.
- Wat for?
Don't compIain
when I take an initiative.
I don't want coId showers
aII summer.
The sea is coId enough.
I can't hear you!
Can you switch off the motor?
Stop interrupting me.
Leave the weeds aIone.
They're pretty.
A garden needs upkeep.
I'II caII you back!
I'm going to the beach with the boys!
Wy did you run off
without teIIing me?
I wanted you to meet Didier.
I'm sick of your IittIe game.
I want you to teII your dad about us.
Wat for?
Because it's not funny anymore.
Were's the water-heater?
We don't need a pIumber here.
Sorry,
it wasn't premeditated, I swear.
It just happened, Iike that.
Stop apoIogizing. It's done now.
I shouIdn't have come.
It was easy to say I was busy.
I wanted to see what you Iooked Iike.
Nothing briIIiant.
You're stiII hot.
It's what kiIIed me.
Strange coincidence
my son caIIed you.
It's no coincidence.
You know CharIy?
Were did you meet?
At the fort.
It's not at aII what you think.
I was gIad to see you again.
Me too.
See you around.
I'm not going on vacation.
The EngIish and the Parisians
aIways need a pipe fixed.
You did Iove me.
Change the subject. It's history.
You owe me an expIanation.
Nobody wrote Ietters Iike you.
We were perfect.
Wat can I say?
I stopped coming here.
I was far away. I met Beatrix.
She's beautifuI. She chose me.
And it was easier.
I don't understand renouncing Iove,
especiaIIy for a Iife of Iies.
Wat do you know about my Iife?
I know married men.
HaIf the fags here are married.
It doesn't stop them.
Not me.
I've never cheated on Beatrix.
BuIIshit!
If we fight, it wasn't worth doing
the car breakdown routine.
Didn't you go back to CaIifornia?
Yes, to forget you.
How did you know?
Rumors.
You were worried?
A IittIe.
I was scared,
scared you were dead.
In 1989 or 1990,
there was a TV show about AIDS
and suddenIy I was scared for you.
I came here and I heard
you were far away, in good heaIth.
I was fine.
It's the Promised Land for pIumbers!
But the U.S. has changed
since I was a kid.
In short,
you thought I was far away
and you wouIdn't see me.
I recognized you right off.
I have a daughter caIIed Laura.
She's gone to PortugaI with a biker.
Imagine!
Anyway, it's not my business.
You have to Iet them grow up.
It's not easy.
I couIdn't imagine not having kids.
It wasn't possibIe.
It just wasn't possibIe.
I am happy.
You don't Iook convinced.
I Iook how I Iook.
I know what you Iook Iike with me,
when we make Iove.
PIease, don't be...
I'm direct and sincere.
I Iove you, truIy.
I make Iove to you
and I know I do it weII.
I want to Iive with you.
Leave him.
I'm sick and tired
of being your substitute cock!
Don't yeII.
Sorry. Excuse me.
You're right.
No need to make a scene.
I'II resort to an uItimatum.
You have untiI tomorrow to choose.
Then I'II disappear.
You can't do that.
Wo'II stop me?
Me.
Because I Iove you.
If you Iove me, then come.
Come with me.
Wy do you have to be
so conventionaI?
Can't you be happy Iike this?
We have a nice Iife, fuII of joy.
I want to Iive with the woman I Iove,
the woman who makes me horny.
I rented a car to act Iike a tourist.
WAnt a Iift home?
It couIdn't wait tiII I got home.
That's Didier?
Shit, you're right. He's hot.
I shouId have beIieved you.
I'II take you to your doorstep.
PuII over! Marc's at home.
You'II have to teII a great big Iie.
You'II see it can't go on.
PuII over.
I have an idea.
An answer to everything.
That's your probIem.
AII answers and no reaI questions.
I had a fIat tire.
He drove me home.
Invite him in for a drink.
- He's in a rush.
- Thanks.
He was a IittIe sIeazy.
Don't encourage him.
If you want a fuck, go right ahead.
Wat's got into you?
It was a joke.
Save it for your customers.
I'II fix your bike.
No, I'II do it.
You're busy with the garden.
I've changed my mind.
It's wrong to want
things to be square,
cIean-cut and orderly.
Let nature have its way.
That what I've aIways said.
You know that guy?
Wat guy?
The pIumber.
ShouId I?
I don't know.
You came here often.
It doesn't mean
I know aII the pIumbers.
Give me a hand.
Pass the Iawn trimmer.
You'II never get it out.
I won't be using it again.
Dad, I just wanted to teII you,
you know...
Martin and I are just friends.
I'm not gay.
He is, not me.
Now what?
CongratuIations?
No, I was just Ietting you know.
So you don't imagine...
I wasn't.
Live your Iife and Ieave me aIone!
You're not gay? Great!
Wat does it change?
Wat's your probIem?
Stay off the violets,
they wind you up!
Can I taIk to you?
Sure.
I wanted to set things straight
about Martin.
I don't know.
I don't have an answer. Happy now?
- You were saying?
- Nothing.
Yes, you were!
You're totaIIy cracked too!
Give up the violets!
You think this is good timing?
Because I'm very toIerant,
immenseIy toIerant
and I want peopIe
to be the same with me.
That goes for everyone!
''Mom this, Beatrix that...
Yes and no, yes or no!''
Wy not yes and no at once?
RoII on winter!
lt's the taste of salt on your skin
l miss most,
the taste of the sea
where we made love...
Your taste of sheIIfish.
l love you, l love you,
l'll love you forever.
My future is with you.
We'll stand up to others.
Our love is beautiful.
lt will silence them.
I can't take it. I'm going crazy!
Let's caIm down!
Were are you going?
I'm getting some air.
At midnight?
I'm responsibIe for you. You can't!
It's not the first time.
But this time I know.
I need to go out. Let me go!
I'II come too. We can taIk.
I thought you didn't give a damn
about our teen dramas!
I don't want to taIk now.
I want to fuck. Get it?
You're underage!
My phone's outside, not me.
Wy are you here?
They aII went out,
Ieaving the door open, so I came in.
It was aImost an invitation.
They've aII gone out?
Were did they go?
I don't know but Iet's enjoy it.
I came to heIp you
ask yourseIf reaI questions,
to influence your decision.
That's cheating.
I kind of know you.
I'm staying with the Biancheris.
I saw you Ieave this afternoon.
So?
CharIy's right.
You're reaIIy hot.
WAnt to kiss me?
Wy not?
Wat are you doing here?
I came to get Martin.
Get Iost. I don't need this!
Wat if the cops come?
I run faster.
Get off him!
You're jeaIous.
You stiII taste the same.
TeII him I'm straight.
No guarantees with your famiIy.
Wat's with you?
Your dad stoIe Didier.
I don't get your perverse games!
Dad, Didier...
Wat are you taIking about?
I'm sick of this!
Go join him in the bushes!
Didier's over there!
No use crying.
My name's SyIvain.
You have to go.
They'II come back eventuaIIy.
So? That wouId move things aIong.
Marc is sensitive.
I don't want to hurt him.
Shut up!
Is someone there?
Wat are you doing?
Drinking pastis?
Leave me aIone!
I'II drink if I want.
You didn't add water...
Did you fight with Martin again?
Come on, CharIy.
I know it's difficuIt.
Being in Iove is compIicated
but you're too young
to get worked up Iike this.
My darIing.
Maybe you don't want to taIk now,
but you shouId know
that I accept your sexuaIity.
If you need to taIk, I'm here.
Wat's with my sexuaIity?
Nothing,
Iike I said.
I've spoken to yourfather.
The fact that you're homosexuaI
doesn't change a thing,
not at aII...
I'm not gay!
He's the big fagot!
CharIy, don't use words Iike that.
Martin is yourfriend.
He's a sweet boy...
Are you stupid orwhat?
I'm not taIking about Martin.
It's your husband.
He's out fucking the pIumber!
My dad is gay.
Wat pIumber?
That shouId make things easier.
Wo is he?
Mathieu.
I don't beIieve it!
- WiIe he bangs in the bushes...
- Don't be vuIgar!
Think you're refined?
We do our best.
WAit tiII you're our age to Iecture us.
Stop drinking.
I aIways wondered what it's Iike
to reIive a first Iove.
Now you know.
And so do I.
You can take them croissants.
SIeeping out has its advantages.
I won't Iet you go without a coffee.
I know everything.
No, that's absurd.
Beatrix, I'm a homosexuaI.
No, it's ridicuIous.
I have a Iover too.
That won't work.
I'm gay.
I know everything.
I'm a homosexuaI.
Life is compIicated.
No, that's dumb.
Beatrix, I'm gay.
No, not Iike that.
Marc, Iife is not so compIicated.
I can't, I can't...
Marc, Iife is not so compIicated.
No, it's not true.
I know everything.
I Iove the pIumber.
Let's go to the sea.
You smeII of coffee.
CharIy didn't take it too weII.
You'II have to taIk to him.
Teenagers are so conventionaI.
And you?
I had a Dutch mom, remember.
And there's Mathieu.
Secret for secret,
you weren't the biggest Iiar.
It doesn't change much.
I imposed the Iies.
No, I accepted them.
If you think about it,
I'm the weirdest of aII
because I chose you.
I stiII think it wasn't a bad choice.
You're a good husband.
You're kind, tender and funny.
Not macho, not jeaIous.
You never Iook at other girls.
That's an advantage.
The truth is I Iove you.
In a strange way but I Iove you.
I Iove you too.
It won't be easy.
With a IittIe imagination.
The following summer...
We'II take this one.
The view's great.
I Iove this room,
but it has a singIe bed.
Can you heIp me
bring up the doubIe bed?
Right now?
Tomorrow is fine.
JuIie gets here Thursday.
Maybe we'II stay a few days.
It's not so bad here.
Time for a IittIe game.
You have to find
what's changed in the house.
You painted the shutters!
That's not it. Not the shutters.
It's something Iess obvious.
Freezing!
CoId.
WArm.
BoiIing, boiIing, boiIing!
I knew you were a great guy.
I'II try it now.
All through summer we dance
Every night a drunken trance
Celebrations get the upper hand
Eating shellfish in the sand
Cockles, Cockles
Clams, clams
Abalone, abalone
Shrimp, shrimp
Winkles, scallops, mussels,
sea urchins, crabs
Cockles, abalone,
winkles, crabs and clams
Swept away by the tide
Hypnotized by sunshine's spell
Promised to a life that's never bland
Eating shellfish in the sand
Carried along by the tide
Caught in summer's spell
Letting love take full command
Eating shellfish in the sand
SubtitIes fusain
