For heaven's sake.
''The races!''
That's all he needs
is to be taken to the races.
As if he hasn't got enough trouble now.
Ella.
When are you gonna stop
worrying about that playboy?
He's not a playboy.
He's a very talented playwright.
All he does is play. he never writes.
l beg your pardon?
He and his partner have written most of
the successful successes on Broadway.
So. what's his problem?
-His partner left him.
-So?
He has to write alone.
So let him write alone. Big deal.
Don't you see what that
can mean to somebody?
He's terrified that he might not
be able to make it alone.
-He's sensitive. he's creative.
-Hi. girls.
Hi. He's artistic.
Oh. Ella.
Look at this.
Miss Number 63 is canceling service...
...because she's marrying Mr. Number 78.
Oh. how wonderful.
l had nothing to do with it.
l happened to know that Miss Number 63
wanted to mate her female Siamese cat.
And l also knew that Mr. Number 78
had a male Siamese cat.
So l told her. and she called him...
-...and they all got together.
-The fact remains...
...we now have one account
instead of two.
Ella. l have told you a thousand times...
...just give and take messages. That's all.
Don't be so helpful to the subscribers.
It could get us into trouble.
Why don't you help yourself
and get yourself a man?
Ella. what are you doing here?
l made that date for you at 5:OO.
-Do l have to go?
-Do you have...?
Ella. this is the sixth young man
l've dredged up this year.
He's a very nice young man.
He's the nephew of my dearest friend...
...so please make an effort.
All right.
Ella.
All right.
Don't forget to wake Jeffrey Moss up
in time for his appointment.
All that yakety-yak at the board. yet
every time she goes out with a real fella...
-...she clams up like an oyster.
-She's a little shy.
-Her fingers turn into thumbs.
-lt takes a little while--
-She knocks things over. spills drinks.
-Maybe--
The only thing she
hasn't done is catch on fire.
Miss Pringle's residence.
l couldn't possibly hold a table
for that length of time. l have reservations--
-Let me look.
-Captain. captain.
-One moment.
-Will we get our table soon?
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-We've been waiting.
l'm afraid my date
is going to die of starvation.
-l'll check as soon as l can.
-Would you. please? Thank you.
Hello. Mr. Chase?
Yes. 10:1 5. a party of four.
-That's the best l can do.
-l seem to have picked out the wrong place.
They're so busy here. we may
have to do our own cooking.
Anyway. we have these. Now. if we
could just get our table. Captain?
You're being an awfully
good sport about all this.
Well. Iet's have a toast to friendship.
Friendship is the gift of the--
-l'm sorry.
-Oh. l'm sorry.
Just when l'm trying
to make a good impression.
-Oh. l'll get it.
-Oh. no. l'll get--
-Oh. it's--
-Sorry. l--
l hope l didn't hurt you.
You'll think l'm an awful oaf.
l'd better get another drink.
-Oh. no. take this one.
-No. you keep that.
-No. no. no.
-Let's share it. then.
-All right.
-You take the first sip.
lt's getting so late.
l wish they'd-- Oh. captain.
Oh. it is getting late.
Oh. l missed him again.
You know. l'm not usually this clumsy.
lf you wanna know the truth.
l'm a little nervous.
Blind dates don't usually
turn out this well.
And l approached this date
with some trepidation.
l've had some terrible experiences.
You know. my aunt. bless her.
but she and some of her friends...
...including. if you'll forgive me.
your cousin Sue...
...have come up with
some of the most awful dog--
Excuse me. some of the strangest girls.
So when you showed up....
You know. you're a good listener.
That's an art in itself.
Helps to build the other person's ego.
l guess you must be thinking
that l'm kind of garrulous...
...the way l've monopolized
the conversation. but--
-Oh. captain.
-l'm checking on your table right now. sir.
Oh. thank you. that's--
Oh. l'm sorry.
-Your table is ready now. This way. please.
-Thank you.
Good. we can go now--
-Oh. l'm sorry.
-Really. it's all right.
Oh. l'm sorry.
l guess nothing else can happen to us.
You have days where nothing goes right.
That happened to me last week.
-From the first thing in--
-l'm terribly sorry.
My fault. madam.
Anyway. it's possible that the stars
have something to do with that.
l've read about that....
Well. you just beat your own record.
Door to door in 45 minutes.
-How'd it go?
-Oh. fine.
My date suddenly remembered
a pressing engagement.
With a tailor?
-Yes.
-Well. what happened?
Dr. Stafford's office.
-Thís ís Mrs. Herman.
-Oh. Mrs. Herman.
Your basal metabolism test
is at 9 tomorrow.. .
...so don't eat when you wake up.
not even coffee. And don't smoke. please.
-Thanh you.
-Goodbye.
-Hey. Gwynne. where's Sue?
-You're safe.
-She's out with Otto.
-Who?
-You know. that European recording guy.
-Oh. good.
l put a file in this bread
in case you wanna break out of here.
-Hi. Carl.
-Hi.
lf you got money on you. l'd be delighted
to treat you to a soda at the drugstore.
Oh. l'd love it.
-Ella.
-Oh. go ahead. Gwynne. l'll be here.
-Thanks.
-Did you remember to wake Jeffrey Moss?
l tried. The sleeping prince
said to call him again at 6:OO.
But that means he didn't keep
his appointment with his producer.
Ella. he's only a disembodied voice.
remember?
Jeffrey Moss is just Plaza O-4433.
He doesn't mean any more
than any other subscriber to me.
Six o'clock. l have to wake him.
Yeah.
Hello. Mr. Moss?
-ls that you, Mom?
-Yes. it's 6:OO.
Time to get up.
One moment. please.
Ella. aren't you ever gonna give up
that old lady's voice you use on him?
He needs a mother.
Hello. Mr. Moss?
You left yourself this message:
''Get up. you three-toed sloth. You've got
an appointment with Larry Hastings...
...about your play The Mídas Touch.''
Well. you missed that
appointment. Mr. Moss.
Tell what you do:
You call me back ín a couple hours.

Inspector Barnes?
Mr. Barnes. you meathead.
l'm gonna get a promotion
for closing up this joint.
Just because the law arrested
all those girls at All-Alone-A-Phone...
.. .doesn't mean every
answering service is a front for...
-...a lonely-hearts club.
-Come on.
How do you do?
My name is Barnes. We're doing a little
article on the answering services.
We're from...
... Vogue magazine.

Now. tell me. do you enjoy
doing this line of work?
Oh. l love it here. l used to be a plain
switchboard operator in a lingerie house.
Pretty dull. except for a little
modeling on the side.
Modeling on the side. huh?
But this is so much more personal. l come
into contact with so many different types...
...and l can give each one
the particular kind of help he needs.
My cousin Sue thinks l spend
too much time with each one.
She keeps saying. ''Get it over with
and get on to the next one.''
-Excuse me.
-Yes. of course.

By the time l'm through with you.

And here's our list of subscribers. inspector.
Oh. well.... Well. all right.

Listen. l'm gonna be around.

male clients on the outside...
...and you and the madame are gonna be
taking calls at the women's detention home.
Otto.

Splendid.
Oh. Otto. l'll take that.
Ella. please. remember

Splendid. Now. consult
your charts carefully.

''Of Beethoven.''
That's Belmont.

lt's 7:OO?
-l told Mom to call me at 7.
-Your phone's unplugged.
Oh. yeah.
l must have pulled it out last night.
l was looking for something
to hang myself with.
-Mom?
-l've been ríngíng you sínce--
Oh. you're not Mom.
You're the other one.
There's a message for you
from Mr. Hastíngs.
Quote: "Sure you won't show up at 4 today
wíth outlíne of The Midas Touch.
-Have taken optíon on another play.
-Option on another play?
-Hope you eníoy your tríp to skíd row_
-Didn't he say who wrote it?
Shakespeare? Tennessee Williams?
-Tennessee Ernie?
-l beg your pardon?
lt's all right. Goodbye.
Good old Larry.
A phony like the rest of them.
Well. might as well go to sleep forever.
Goodbye. Iady.
-You shouldn't do that.
-What'd you say?
l said. you shouldn't do that.
You won't be able to do your work.
Look. Iady. l hope you won't be offended
if l let you know...
...that my evil habits are no concern
of yours. Will you get out of here?
-You won't do your work.
-Thank you very much.
Miss?
-What work?
-lf you wanna drink at this hour...
...there must be some work
you're trying to avoid.
l know from my own experience.
ln high school. l'd do anything
to keep from doing my homework.
Mostly. l'd sharpen pencils. You know.
the yellow kind that says ''Ticonderoga''?
Well. l'd sharpen it to the ''Ticonderog.''
and then to the ''Ticonder''...
...and then to the ''Ticond.''
then to the ''Tic.'' then to the ''Ti'' ...
...and then to the ''T.''
Then l'd have to start on another pencil.
Anything but face that awful blank page.
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. sure. go ahead. Drink.
-Ruin your last chance.
-Last chan-- Last chance to do what?
Well. whatever it's your last chance
to do. You look desperate to me.
l'm about to be ill.
You wouldn't happen to have
a cup of coffee on you?
Yes. l would.
And a cheese Danish?
Prune.
-Oh. listen. Miss...?
-Scott.
Melisande.
Moss. Jeffrey.
-Sit down. Miss Scott.
-No. l can't because l have to go.
Oh. well. now that my vision
has cleared up a bit...
...and l'm beginning to see shapes
and colors at more than 6 inches away...
...you're beginning to look
pretty good to me...
...since l haven't anything to do
for the next 10.OOO years....
That's just another way
of avoiding your work. Girls.
And you do have something to do.
You have an appointment to keep.
-Who said so?
-Your 7:OO call. Stay up and start writing.
You can write alone.
You did it once before.
-How do you know l did it once before?
-Because anybody who's a writer...
...must have written something
by himself once.
-Did l say l was a writer?
-No. but you're not a plumber. are you?
-No.
-Well....
But you don't think so yourself.
or you'd be writing...
...instead of running around
and coming home at 7 in the morning...
...and sleeping all day.
lt's uncanny.
-Are you plugged into me somewhere?
-No.
-You know me from someplace.
-No.
-You're psychic.
-Yes.
l'm very intuitive.
l get feelings about people. l know a lot
about you just from listening to you talk.
And l see visions.
-What's the matter?
-l see one now. It's a vision of you.
What am l doing?
Nothing. You're lying facedown
in the gutter.
-Stop it. You're scaring the hell out of me.
-Sorry. that's what l see.
My visions are never wrong.
unless you do something about it.
l tried analysis.
l might as well try witchcraft.
We'll go the old witchcraft routine.
We'll get the doll. we'll get the pins.
and the boiling water and the drums.
Anything you want me to do. l'll do it.
-All right. Do as l say.
-Yeah?
-Go to your typewriter.
-Yeah?
-Sit down.
-Yeah?
-And now...
-Yeah?
...write it.
l knew there was a catch to it.
Oh. that's enough.
You're not so badly off.
l know a guy whose father's forcing him
to be a dentist. He wants to be a composer.
The poor fellow sits up in an office all day
Iong composing songs on an air hose.
Nobody's keeping you
from doing what you want.
Nobody except yourself.
You're afraid everybody's gonna say.
''Oh. the partner's the talented one.''
Well. so what?
You call other people phonies
because you hate yourself.
You're afraid what you write isn't gonna be
important. so you don't write anything.
Boy. do you know me.
Mr. Moss. you have to have
confidence in yourself.
l don't even know you.
but l have confidence in you.
-You do?
-Yes. l do.
-You're crazy.
-Yes. l know.
l'll try.
Hey. wait a minute.
l don't think l can do this
unless you're here.
So that's what you looh líhe
At last l know
You're better
Better than a dream

He liked it. Larry liked it.
Well. of course he liked it.
He said it's not quite written yet. and he
made me promise to go to the country...
...and whip it. but by and large.
it's something of a miracle.
lt's not a miracle. You did it.
-And you know what?
-What?
You're the miracle.
What's the matter? You blind?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't give me none of that. Driving
around here. nobody takes any care.
The light was still green.
He says it was red. It was green.
-People. Wow.
-What'd you expect? Herrings?
Look at them. A band of cutthroats.
You ever see such hatred?
lf l so much as asked one of these people
for the time. they'd turn into a lynch mob.
Everybody wants to be friendly. only
nobody's willing to make the first move.
Why don't you say hello
to this nice man over here?
He'd appreciate it.
Him? That's Dracula's uncle.
the Wolf Man.
The only thing he'd appreciate
would be a nice. fresh cup of blood.

But l feel sick.
Look. we'll have a nice fried glass

We'll dash our glasses into the fireplace.
-No one will know we've been there.

You're worth more to me than all these
people and the city put together. All right?
Look. it's just a little party.
l want you to meet a few people. that's all.
-Good evening. Mr. Moss.
-Good evening. Dennis.

-Hi. Jeff.
Oh. hi. Larry. Come here.
Meet the Melisande Scott. Larry Hastings.
-So you're his little miracle worker. eh?
-How do you do?
After the change in him. l figured
you must be some sort of a magician.
-This is a beautiful house.
-Thank you.
This is the first time we've met.
but there's something familiar about you.
ln the tone of your voice. maybe.
No. of course not. l guess it's just that
Jeff's talked about you so much.
You've gotta tell hím.
You've gotta tell hím.
-Where are the people. Larry?

It just couldn't be more wonderful.

He's such a precious lamb.
He finished the play like a big boy.
And he did it all by himself.
Mrs. Hamhocker. Melisande Scott.
-Congratulations.

-Thank you.
-Larry.
Moss has a beautiful idea for director.
-Excuse us. darling. Come and talk to him.
-l'm sorry. l'll be right back.
l haven't seen anything so shattering
since the Armory Show of 1 91 3.
His name is Kayopa Dochaney.
and every canvas is at least 20 by 20.
l say if you don't have wall space for it...
...just move and get yourself
a place with the wall space.
You'll never regret it. my dear.
They're the most absolute riot
of color. my dear.
And they're all tans and plums and olives.
And they're all pictures of eyes.
Open eyes. closed eyes. blinking eyes.
crossed eyes. eyes crying...
...just eyes. eyes. eyes! Marvelous.
He's the first absolute genius
l've seen since...
...l was a year ago last summer
in the South of France.
l don't know your specifications.
That's the only--
Wait a minute. this is a London call.
We gotta straighten this out.
He's a hack. Iet's face it.
Without Jeff. those plays wouldn't
have gotten off the ground.
-Jeff has the brilliance. the flair. the wit--
-A wonderful ear.
-That's the difference.
-Wonderful ear. You have it or you don't.
You've got to be born with it.
-What a beautiful talent.
-And what a great human being.
l agree with you.
Take it downstairs.
-lt's simply fantastic.
-Hang up when we get downstairs.
Look. we've got to
get this straightened out.
Time me. and l'll be back
in 30 seconds flat.
What is that?
What is what?
l don't think it's a play for a British director.
Well. it was the big night of my life.
Mary and Ethel reminisced for hours.
Mary Martin and Ethel Merman.
No. Mary Astor and Ethel Waters.
Having fun?
l remember it as if it were yesterday.
Everyone in the room...
...had been a star for at least 50 years.
-Mary and Ethel never looked more radiant.
-Mary Astor and Ethel Waters.
-No. Mary Pickford and Ethel Barrymore.
-lt's a little confusing. isn't it?
Don't you let it throw you.
Just do what everybody else does.
-Drop a name. Right. Katie?
-Right.

lt's a very interesting part. See. l make up
these tunes on the air hose...
-...and my father doesn't want me to--
-You...?
l wrote ''The Midas Touch'' on the air hose.
That's what's holding up the play.

This is impossible.
Who could have done this?
Who switched these orders from
Beethoven's 10th to Beethoven's 9th?

nine symphonies.
You idiot! You put all the money
on the wrong horse.
l was almost bumped off for this
by the mob.
Shut up.
To think my simple. little bookie system
can be loused up by this dumb broad.
-Horses?
-Bookies!
Otto. is that what l gave you
all that money for?
-Sue. you didn't.
-That's swell. Ioudmouth.
-Now these dames know all about it.
-They can't talk.
One peep out of them. and the cops will put
them in jail and close up Susanswerphone.
-Let's go! The money!
-My life savings!
-Ella. please do something!
-Shut up!
-They don't get it.
-Get what?
Shut up!
-Okay. Otto. your number's up.
-Ridiculous.
Oh. no. Remember Mr. Barnes
of Vogue magazine?
-Vogue_
-He's not Mr. Barnes. He's Inspector Barnes.
And the cops know about this
whole layout. It's a trap!
You're coming with us to Corvello's.
No. no. no. It won't be necessary
to rub us out. boys. because....
Because you've all been
spilling your guts into a tape recorder.
Where is it?
Where is it?
You think you're playing with kids?
''Where is it?''
Where is it?
lt's rigged up to the police station.
that's where.
And you better get going.

lnspector Barnes.

-Get your toothbrush and come on along.
-My toothbrush?
-That's right.
-No. we can just drop that act right now.. .

bookie mob right here.
-All you have to do is take them away.
-lnspector Barnes. l surrender happily.
These are two of Corvello's henchmen.
l want to congratulate you.. .
...for having such a brilliant ally working
with you to uncover the Corvello gang.
Me? l'm nothing. Small potatoes.
Corvello. he's the head of everything.
We only work for him.
-What?
-lnspector. don't you get the picture?
Titanic Records is a bookie operation.
-Take them away.
-Take them away!
-Farewell. my líebchen.
-Oh. Otto. how you deceived me.
But how you deceived me.
you little Mata Hari.
lnspector Barnes.
you'll get a promotion for this.
l didn't do anything.
l told you she was a nice girl.
Well. is it a crime to have made
a human mistake? l misjudged you.
l wonder if you'd mind coming down to
the station with me. l may need your help.
l'll be glad to.
Now. Ella. promise me you won't leave.
l'll watch the board till you get back.
Oh. l forgot to turn it back on again.
-Susanswerphone.

-Who? Speak slower.
-l know she works there.
-There's nobody here by that name.

There's nobody here by that name.
Crackpot!

Melanie or Melisande.
He said he was coming down here.
-No. Sue. l can't stay!

It looks like something out of Olíyer Twíst.
-What?
-Keep away. young man.
We girls are not allowed
to be familiar with the customers.
Mom.
Mom. Don't you know me?
Don't you know your little telephonic

-Whatever your name is. l love you.
-You can't. l tricked you.
Pretty shabby trick...
...saving a man's life.
But all that stuff. l was just telling you
what you told Mom. l'm nothing.
Now. don't you call Mom ''nothing.''
l loved talking to Mom.
She was warm. sympathetic.
wise. understanding.
l thought she was a little old lady.
lsn't it a nice surprise to find out
that she's a beautiful blond...
...who knows how to cha-cha?
But you have to let me explain
what l did to you.
Never mind.
l got you pretty well figured out.
l had a long trip all the way from
Brooklyn Heights to work on it.
Dr. Kitchell. Barton.
Ella. you do things like that...
...just the same way you say hello
to people on the street.
Ella. you're a girl
with a lot of love to give.
Don't scatter it all over the place.
Give it to me.
l need it.
l want it.
Ella!
This is Plaza O-4433.

-You must be the other one.
Here's some others who want to see you.
Butterfield 8-9970!
-Dr. Kitchell!
-How can l ever thank you?
Oh. don't thank me.
