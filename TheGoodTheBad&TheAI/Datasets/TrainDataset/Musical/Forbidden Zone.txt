Whoa, lordy!
Wooo, wow!
Lemme outa here! Oh feet, do yo' stuff.
Wu-huh! Wu-huh! Woooow!
Thank you very much
for that delicious breakfast.
It was absolument superbe!
I'd like to chat with you longer...
however, I regret that
Flash and I have to hurry along to school.
As I am a new student,
I don't want to make a bad impression.
Yeah. The principal, Mr. Yodlebein,
sent out bulletins to all the classrooms...
and he said that if anybody's gonna be late,
they're gonna be punished.
Oh, children, don't be late for school.
And, Flash, be sure you tie
your grandfather up...
and check the knots real good.
While he was sniffing around
for food yesterday...
he nearly wandered into the Forbidden Zone.
The Forbidden Zone?
Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça, alors?
What are you ever talking about?
Squeezit Henderson's got a brother
that dresses like a broad.
And he took us down into the basement...
and showed us those funny games,
you know, like the adults play...
and he went through a door,
and he never came out.
A door leading to the Sixth Dimension?
How strange, yet intriguing.
Just imagine the adventurous world
beyond that door.
You don't ever...
You don't ever,
you don't ever....
Holy cow. It's ten to 9:00.
Come on, Gramps, we gotta tie you up now.
FRENCHY: Oh, la, la, we'll be late for school.
Ewww! Squeezit Henderson.
Will you get a load of that jerk, will you?
Ewww!
Hey, Frenchy, you got a Kleenex?
I got something stuck in my throat.
No, sorry.
SQUEEZIT: Hi, Flash. Hi, Frenchy.
FLASH: How you doing, man?
Flash told me that you have a twin brother
that disappeared behind the door...
in our basement.
It's not my brother, it's my sister.
FLASH: It's your brother, he only acts
like a broad. He's a faggot.
You're the faggot.
Do you think
you'll ever see your sister again?
You know, I think I've accomplished
astral projection with my sister.
FLASH: Ah, banana oil.
Formidable, alors! How fascinating.
You'll have to tell me everything about it.
Well, last night,
my mother was punishing me again...
and I begged her to stop hurting me,
but she wouldn't.
And finally the pain got so intense
and unbearable that I felt like I was dying...
and leaving my body,
and then I had this vision of my sister...
that was so real, I could see her as clearly
as I'm looking at both of you right now.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
FAUSTO: Don't push your luck, Henderson.
Chérie.
Fausto, 1,000 years...
and for some reason,
I just can't get enough of you.
Everything got black. I must've fainted.
How amazing.
FRENCHY: And she disappeared
in our own basement.
In your own basement.
Well, so long, Squeezit.
Come on, Sis,
Miss Feldman will mark us tardy.
Come on, Squeezit,
we're going to be late for class.
JOHNNY: You fucking kid!
You motherfucking kid!
JOHNNY: I told you not to do that,
you motherfucker.
JOHNNY: I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
JOHNNY: You fucking bitch.
You motherfucker.
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch.
Squeezit Henderson, please come forward,
and lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Class, we have a new student.
Flash's sister Susan will come and tell us
of her studies in France.
Man, I think I'll put up 400 on this one.
Check that out, man.
Hey, man, put that motherfucking chip
back on the table.
Put the chip back on the table, man.
-I'll blow your brains out.
-Hold me back, blood.
Hold you back nothing, I'll hold you back--
-Squeezit?
-Johnny just shot Billy.
-Johnny?
-Well, the man was cheating.
So I just had to do away with him,
and that's all there was to it.
That does it, Johnny,
you're going to Mr. Yodlebein's office.
You ain't taking me nowhere,
you honky bitch!
I didn't want to come to school, no way!
Frenchy, come back, they'll mark you truant!
FRENCHY: Is anybody home?
Mama, are you okay?
I guess I'm all right.
I'll be okay in just a minute.
-Just go out and play.
-Oh, okay.
I think I'm going to take a little peek
behind that Forbidden Door.
I'm so curious, I can't resist.
Merde, alors!
Hot damn! The Sixth Dimension!
Do I detect a rhumba?
PRINCESS: Stop the music! Stop the music!
Seize the intruder.
She must be taken before my parents.
BOTH: Go along with the Princess now,
and don't be cheeky.
Be sure and call me
if they decide to snuff her.
Who is this that cometh
out of the wilderness...
like pillar of smoke...
perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?
Just another slab of meat for my dungeon.
Quel bordel de merde.
FAUSTO: Thy speech is comely.
FRENCHY: Enculé.
Thy lips are like threads of scarlet.
This isn't very amusing, darling.
Why do you waste your words
on this piece of petit-fois?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing, nothing...
a mere outburst of the poet within me.
Take her to Cell 63.
You're Squeezit Henderson's sister, René.
Cheese it, it's the Princess!
My pet needs a mate.
Oh, he can do it to me. Honest!
Why don't you go down on your knees,
and give him what he wants?
Oooo! You're really gonna get it.
You make a lovely couple.
Lucky, lucky, lucky
the boss really noticed you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Uh-huh!
But how can he bear
the touch of that loathsome Queen?
She's nothing but an old, fat whore.
The Queen is a very important person.
She hurts me a lot, but I respect her.
-Doris, you surprised me.
-Just what do you think you're pulling here?
-I was just only looking at her.
-Oh, yeah?
Listen, buster, looking's dangerous.
Next thing you know,
you'll be sucking on her mangoes.
My, my, aren't you a jealous one?
Well, why shouldn't I be?
It gets on my nerves, you know.
You know, I must have my army.
I'm not about to compromise my position
in life, my ancestry...
my tradition, for your silly little suspicions.
Your army!
Where is your precious army?
I will have a whole army of Zombie.
A Zombie Marine Corps...
a Zombie Navy Corps,
a Zombie Space Cadets--
You're really out to lunch.
Look at this world you've cooked up.
And you expect
to take over another universe?
You dumb fuck.
Just wait until these dead babies
start marching...
and you'll be eating your words.
I am waiting, Your Majesty,
waiting for you to tell me...
why that French slit is so special to you,
and why you carry her photograph...
around in your pocket.
FAUSTO: All right, I'll tell you.
She's French, and that's simple.
And therefore, she's of the master race...
a direct descendant of God, just like me.
Direct descendant of God?
You just want to slip her the pork.
That does it.
I'm hopping the next bus out of here.
FAUSTO: You cannot mean that.
What will you do?
Just go on living, I guess.
Oh, chérie, ma petite coquette,
ma petite princesse.
Mon petit chou, c'est rien.
Harder.
Frenchy! Harder!
I hope you were not treated badly.
I gave strict instructions for you
to be put in our most cheery dungeon.
Why am I prisoner here?
It's for your own safety, chérie.
The Queen may have had you tortured...
or executed, had it not been
for my quick and decisive action.
-Vous-êtes artiste?
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
I am a soldier by profession.
This is only doodling, you know, to relax.
La couleur, la form, l'image!
C'est vraiment magnifique.
Vous êtes tres gentille.
It's nothing, nothing at all.
-

Shut up, you punk.
FLASH: Squeezit, if you're too scared
to help me rescue René and Frenchy...
FLASH: I'm gonna have to get that
kosher fart grandfather of mine to help me.
SQUEEZIT: Yeah, but Miss Feldman
will never let you out of class this early.
FLASH: Oh, yeah?
Gramps, come on, lean back.
Let me untie you.
We got to go save Sis.
Shit.
Come on, Gramps, let's go.
Change your foreign money to local currency.
Change your foreign money to local currency.
Okay, Mr. Bernstein,
give me a quarter's worth.
Two craps. How do you like that?
Killer Rosenblatt, the famous Jewish wrestler.
I've read all about you in the paper.
Well, you see, Gramps, he can't hear you...
'cause he's so used to hollering
at the opposition...
he's deaf and dumb.
So what's a nice Jewish boy like you
doing in the Sixth Dimension?
You see Gramps, we're here
to find my sister Frenchy. She disappeared.
The French girl in 63?
Oy vey, oy vey, oy vey!
If the Queen should find out
what the King is doing to that girl...
-She'd murder the poor girl.
-No kidding?
Tell me, Gramps, you got a way,
maybe I can get my sister back?
Get his sister back, he says. Let me think.
I have a strategy that could get her back.
I could even bring Jesus Christ himself
back again.
-For how much?
-For three shekels.
-Okay, three shekels. You got a deal, okay?
-Okay.
Here's three shekels.
Now I'll tell you....
Wait a minute, Gramps. Hold it.
Let me get rid of this guy.
Hey, Bust Rod, here's a quarter.
Go get me a pack of cigarettes.
Camels, like a good fellow, that's the idea.
Come on, Gramps, let's go find Sis.
I'll give you one last chance to live...
you sniveling little weasel!
Tell me why you and the Fat One
came into our Kingdom here.
If I tell you, will you let me and Gramps go
and take one of the prisoners with us?
QUEEN DORIS: Of course, dear.
FLASH: See, we really came here...
to rescue my sister,
you understand? Frenchy.
Because Mr. Bernstein said that
she's in great danger.
The King fell in love with her,
and the Queen is jealous.
Oh. You're the Queen.
Lower the rope!
FLASH: Gramps!
But, Your Majesty, you promised.
Gramps, let go of what you're holding.
Gramps, let go, I might fall!
Assemble all prisoners from Cell 63
into the Interrogation Cell.
But, Mommy, can't I watch some more?
They're still wiggling.
You heard me!
-
-
Oh, darn. The fuse blew.
-Flash Hercules at your service, ma'am.
-Ma'am? I am the Ex-Queen!
I was once happily married to King Fausto...
until that fat loathsome cow, Queen Doris...
that silicone uddered pig
stole the throne by seducing me...
even though she's not my type.
She thinks I'm dead...
because he, the King,
couldn't stand to see me die...
because he's such a coward,
so he threw me a mile down in this cell...
where I've been for 1,000 years,
and to maintain my sanity...
I've been writing a screenplay,
and it's so difficult...
because there's no hot water,
there's no fresh orange juice.
There's bats falling in my hair at night
and roaches climbing through the pages...
and so much dust on the keys...
that I just can't stand it another minute!
Okay, Queenie, don't worry about nothing.
I'll get you out of this place.
Here, watch my magic propeller,
and off we go.
Come on, Gramps, let's go find Sis.
I've got to change a Tampax,
I'll see you later.
You fuzzy bastard. Come on, Gramps.

By the way, honey, when is that mentally
retarded Swedish husband of yours...
coming home, anyhow?
Mmmm, hello there.
Hello there.
Hi, Pa. Gee, I'm glad to see you.
I'll get you out of here, Pa, don't worry,
and then I'll go save Frenchy.
You leave me be.
In the real world up there,
I was just another rat...
and down here, I also live like a rat.
So what's the difference? Go avay.
I vant to be alone.
Ah, banana oil.
You're gonna see your son in a minute.
He just turned 11.
What the frig are you talking about?
Me, a kid? Ruthy, come on.
You're the one, okay, you big gorilla.
You wanna see him, eh?
You wanna see Chicken Boy?
Oh, Chicken Boy?
You wanna see him? You wanna see
Chicken Boy? Oh, Chicken Boy?
That's really rich.
-Mom, mom.
-Squeezit, meet your pop.
-Dad?
-I ain't your dad.
Unless we got chickens in the family.
Come here, baby.
Oh, yes.
What are you doing, you big lug?
Squeezit, help your mom!
Let go of my mother.
Hey!
Come here.
SQUEEZIT: I love you.
MOM: Shut up!
You're too much, baby.
Come on, sugar,
I got a hard-on that won't wait...
-And the ship leaves in a couple of hours.
-What do you mean, a couple of hours?
That's a sailor's life, baby.
SQUEEZIT: I love you, Mom.
I love you. I love you.
SQUEEZIT: I don't know where to begin.
CHICKEN: At the beginning.
-I have no self-respect.
-Why, Squeezit.
I have no courage. René and Frenchy
are prisoners in the Sixth Dimension...
and I didn't go
when my help was asked to save them.
-Nobody ever helped you.
-But I don't need any help.
You know the chickens are always ready
to help you any way we can...
-But as you know....
-What can chickens do?
-Precisely.
-I wish I could be brave, like Flash.
Gee whiz!
-Henderson here.
-Hey, Squeezit, man.
Yeah, you got to come down here
right away. We're lost.
-Maybe I'll gain some self-respect.
-Frenchy and René are in great danger.
I've got nothing else to live for. I'll help.
I'll help!
Where are you taking me? Where's René?
Where's Frenchy?
I demand an answer.
Ow! Ow!
Yoo-hoo!
Well, if it ain't the little Princess!
DEMON: Come on there, boy.
-Gee, that girl was beautiful.
-You said it, brother.
My boss is just dying to stick his fork
in that there tomato.
Is your boss
the leader of the Sixth Dimension?
No, that be the little Midget King.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Okay.

-
-

Keep an eye on the King.
And keep me posted.
He doesn't know
where I've hid that French slit.
He may be a little man...
but he carries a big stick!
And whatever you do, Froggy...
keep him away from that interrogation cell.
I knew you'd come to save me!
Bust Rod told me
that the Queen took you here.
I had no idea that she would resort
to such a thing.
Please, I beg your forgiveness.
It's all forgiven, my Fausto.
The Queen said she was gonna ream us
with 20-inch cattle prods...
-And I'm still waiting.
-We must hurry now.
Bust Rod, undo her chains quickly.
I must command you
to leave the Forbidden Zone at once.
This is for your own safety.
Henderson will show you the way out.
Aren't you gonna hump us
one last time, Fausto?
Shut up!
When will I ever see you again, mon amour?
I cannot answer to you that right now...
but somehow I feel
that our destinies are intertwined.
RENÉ: Come on, Frenchy.
FAUSTO: Goodbye.
You let the French girl go?
Don't you think you'd better go get her?
-Goddamn it.
-René, René stop it!
René, help!
Somebody help me! Shit!
Let me go!
Guess what?
The Mystic Knights took the Princess
as hostage...
and if anything happens
to René and Frenchy...
she's really gonna get it.
But I helped them escape.
Yeah, but I heard a rumor
that the Queen captured them all again.
Attention, all soldiers!
So you thought you'd get away?
Well, your little King
won't be able to help you now!
-Nobody'll find you down here.
-He'll find me, I know he will.
-And he won't let you get away with this shit.
-Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll see about that.
No one can survive
what this child will go through.
So take a good look, you French slit,
'cause you're next.
ALL: Throw her in the pit!
Khomeini.
ALL: Khomeini.
Throw the French girl in.
That's not fair. It's my turn next.
My frog, you killed my frog, goddamn it!
-You killed my Froggy.
-So get another one, bitch.
You're supposed to be dead.
Uh-uh, Baby. You're dead.
I know that voice. You're the one
the King keeps locked up in the pit.
This is going up your asshole
as soon as I've finished with Queenie here.
Faggot.
Your buns smell like lox, honey,
I can smell them from here.
Attention, all soldiers!
We have to save the French girl.
-Hurry up.
-That's what we're trying to do.
Come on, shut up. Let's go.
Hurry up. Come on.
Nothing can stop me now.
What are you doing?
I'm going to open her up
like a can of worms.
No, our daughter is their hostage.
If you kill the girl, they will kill the Princess.
-Out of my way, or you'll be first.
-Come to your senses, darling.
You'll be killing your own daughter.
Oh, God.
Oh, beat me! Oh, kill me!
Oh, fuck that asshole!
Please don't die.
Please don't die.
Life was so beautiful.
Oh, why does it feel so good to be so bad?
You...you were
the only decent thing in my life.
Smile at me one last time.
Tell me how you love to...
Tell me how you love to...
I love to feel your nipples stiffen
when I caress them with my finger tips.
Oh, Fausto. Faust-

-La Chaim.
A toast to him as we salute the true Queen.
She really is a sight.

-The Hercules are in for stormy weather.
-No, it's really just a breeze!
