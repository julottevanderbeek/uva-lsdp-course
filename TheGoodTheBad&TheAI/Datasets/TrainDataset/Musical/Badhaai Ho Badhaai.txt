Breakfast for me,
breakfast for Ranjit...
...and what about
breakfast for the kids?
No breakfast for them, no lunch.
- Yes, why? - Have you
seen their school grades?
Six out of ten, four out of ten
and a zero in mathematics! Zero.
- Imps! Why have you scored so low?
- That's just why.
No breakfast, no lunch for them.
You'll keep the tiger hungry?
Tiger? Oh you mean your daddy?
Why should he go hungry?
Because that scorecard is his.
- Jassi's? From his schooldays?
- Yes Grandpa
Such were the fruits Daddy reaped
with his labours. He hid it away
- Kids, what about your grades?
- Here. I scored 80 percent.
Ravi scored 85 percent.
The rascal!
All these 27 years he hid it!
I'll shave his head or,
I'm no head of the family
There he is.
Well Daddy, whom are
you tonsuring today?
- Tell him!
- Remember that perfect portrait?
The time when I shaved your
head when you were a kid
You know?
Nitu has scored 80 percent...
...and Ravi scored 85 percent
Is that any reason to rejoice?
I used to score between
Grandpa... junk
- Junk?
- That's about the junk we trashed.
In mathematics,
I scored 99 percent.
Grandpa... trash.
- Trash?
- We trashed the junk.
Make sure you put in
the effort, score more.
Oh Lord! What's happening to me?
Jesus...
- What's happening?
- What happened?
- Does anyone even care for me?
- Why what's wrong, Steven?
I was fine, I was asleep and
something happened when I got up
My waist is feeling like...
...a lamp-post
run-into by a truck!
I'll get you milk and turmeric.
Bless turmeric!
Turmeric is healthy
Turmeric is no use, Mummy
- I'm calling the doctor.
- No injections! Hurts.
- Do something!
- Yes, right away.
- It's gone!
- It never was.
But it was! And as soon as you
said one-two-three, it was gone.
At your age, you're the one
who's a genius at kidding.
Just like the acts you put in
when you wanted chocolates...
...that's my waist-ache, I crave
for the attention you know.
- May I come in?
- Yes?
Can you tell where this address is?
I got to deliver flowers.
Son of a mad dog! How dare you
ask me about Steven D'souza?
- So you went to him asking for me?
- I did
- And he gave you an answer?
- A slap.
- On which cheek?
- This one
How dare you ask my
address from that Chaddha?
Saw? The vibes of rivalry!
Can even set flowers afire.
Think! You come to deliver
flowers and you get slapped
Had you come delivering
cooking gas...
...you'd be blown to smithereens.
- What kind of a rivalry is this?
- That's just the trailer.
See the sons and you'll get to
see a whole movie. Action-packed
Goodness
No, we don't trail him.
He mustn't overtake us.
Overtake, quick.
Faster.
- No losing! We must race ahead.
- Just watch
Speed up
Overtake.
See?
Well done!
Now what does he do?
Son of a gun!
You let the rogue win.
I'm fed up of their spats.
Forever up to one-upmanship.
Warring countries can become
friends, but not them.
God help
Why do they squabble?
Is it a Hindu-Christian clash?
My Daddy told me that they
were once the best of friends
They wined, dined and
socialised with each other.
Among the Christians,
there were Anthony...
...and his elder brother, Moses
And there were Anjali
and her brother Jassi
The families were close friends.
Anjali and Anthony were friends too
- With time, the friendship changed.
- Meaning?
- They fell in love.
- And then?
That which always happens.
Their families got
wind of the affair.
Anjali was already betrothed.
The Hindu family
refused to consent.
The families raked up
a mighty quarrel...
...but Anjali and
Anthony were unscathed
They were in love and...
they went away from their families.
Eloped. Married
It's been 27 years without even
a single letter from the couple.
It's said they live in Delhi.
But over here...
...the loving ties that the two
families shared was shattered.
Shattered forever?
And their conspiracies
fuel their hatred.
- Can they never friends again?
- It can only be a miracle.
- How are you, Tulsiram?
- I'm fine, thank you.
- For us?
- Yes madam
- Where from?
- One Raja from New Delhi.
- Whose letter, Daddy?
- Anjali's son.
- Anjali... who's Anjali?
- Jassi! Your sister.
Anjali's letter? After 27 years?
Ranjit! Papa's sister's letter.
- Read it. What does she write?
- Not Anjali, her son
- Read it!
- "Respected Grandfather..."
"Grandmother, Uncle,
Aunt, my obeisances"
Who cares for his obeisances?
"For long, I have
wanted to meet you"
"I crave for your affections"
Craves?
"My wish is about to be given.
I am arriving tomorrow.
Yours, Raja"
Let him come.
I'll put him in his place.
- Mummy, who's Raja to us?
- Your cousin.
Shut up!
- Stop telling them nonsense!
- But he is their cousin.
...And you and I are uncle and aunt.
- Enough! Stop it!
What relationship?
The relationship was over...
...the day she eloped
with that Christian boy
Daddy, you tell everyone!
Anyone who tries to be friendly...
...anyone who welcomes the
son of that runaway girl...
...will leave this house.
He is no relation of ours.
Not even his shadow must
fall upon this house.
Mother of Moses, what's this I see?
Over there.
Here's grandma.
Rosie, I ask you. In this house
who's the elder? Me or Moses?
- You.
- Then I decide...
...who is welcome and who isn't.
This is my decision.
That boy won't step into my house.
If he does, I'll break his bones.
Whose photo is that?
"The feather in your turban..."
"is made resplendent by a gem..."
"...reflecting the colours of joy"
"Let's celebrate"
"Thank your mother,
she gives you luck"
"And here comes
your luckiest day..."
"when you will wed"
"Bedecked in flowers...
...you have come to wed"
"Fragrant...
...is the day..."
"come, let's celebrate"
"Let's celebrate"
"His sisters await
their sister-in-law..."
"for they want her for a friend"
"Their brother is lovable
his wife must be lovable"
"And they will make
a lovely couple"
"Like the Sun and the Moon..."
"like the Sun wedding the Moon"
"Let's celebrate"
"Oh come, let's celebrate"
So, boarding the wrong bus
was a wonderful mistake!
Unbelievable!
You came among us a stranger,
now you're part of the family.
Raja, won't you stay?
Won't you cheer up the bride?
But an untrodden path
beckons me. Farewell.
Lucky, we got a lift.
Else, we were stranded here for 3 days
Grandmother, Raja is here.
Grandfather
Greetings, Uncle.
- Uncle...
- Raja, it's curtains. No use.
- Both gates shut. Now what?
- A third gate is still open
- Which one?
- Brains, you fool. The mind
Any houses on
hire on this street?
Not one in the entire village.
- Why? - I told you.
No houses on rent.
The rest are like part players.
That one looks like an
important character.
- Hi Mr Smokes! How are you?
- Who are you?
- You're Mr Smokes, aren't you?
- Who says?
A man is know by his habits.
You smoke, so you're Mr Smokes
- My name is Balli.
- Any other name makes a difference?
Come, let's go to the hotel.
Remember?
We met at the Vaishno
Devi shrine...
and we sang glories to the goddess.
But I've never been
to Vaishno Devi.
What difference?
Let's sit.
Remember?
We shared the sweet "laddoos"
- Hey, sweets for us.
- Not sweets. I have blood sugar.
- Blood sugar?
- Yes, and spices give me ulcers.
And sours give me a cough.
Salt pumps up blood pressure.
Ice cream gives me a cold and
cold drink gives me asthma.
So many diseases?
Despite, you smoke?
What to do? For me, smoke is
breakfast, lunch and dinner
- I smoke, despite the asthma.
- Raja, we got ourselves a house
- How come?
- He has every disease.
He'll die soon.
As soon as he dies, we'll move in
Why are you laughing?
What's the topic?
Topic is why won't anyone
let us rent a house?
You don't know!
Your uncles...
They won't spare the man who
puts you up. So best for you...
...go back the way
you came. Goodbye
If you are stubborn, so am I.
It's your blood in my veins
If you don't accept me...
I'm picketing...
- right here, in this lane.
- That's my challenge
- Sorry, I got emotional.
- Get it?
Grandma, Raja is
sitting right outside.
Outside?
So what, so what?
Go, don't disturb me
Come here
Take care of the wafers.
I'm going upstairs.
- What's taking you?
- Just came up to see the lovely...
- The lovely...
- I mean I came to see the Moon
The Moon rises at night.
Are you mad?
What are you looking at?
Go inside
Went out to check
whether the gate is shut.
- The gate is shut.
- The gate to your heart...
...that's what you must shut
- Great one-line from your son.
- Left you at a loss for words
It's nearly eight!
And you're still sitting here? Go inside
Shut your shops!
It's nearly eight
Get out of here!
It's nearly eight
One minute... why is
everyone running scared?
Ghuman Singh Rathore starts
singing at eight o'clock.
It's a catastrophe
Let me go! My wife and
children are all alone at home
Guns and knives are
used for threatening
For the first time someone's
using music for threatening
Who might it be?
- Wonderful!
- Rise, children
- What a voice!
- Rise
- What a song!
- Was that a song?
Master, why are you in tears?
For the first time in my life...
...I find patrons of
my music at my doorstep
My cup floweth over in my tears
- You are great, Master!
Great! - Forget me
Tell me about yourselves.
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Lucky lyer.
I'm India's first lucky lyer.
Lucky lyer? You look like a Punjabi
and you talk like a Tamil
What are you?
North Indian? South Indian?
My mother is North Indian.
My Dad is South Indian.
I'm complete Indian
Your friend is quite a bore.
- Mr Ghuman Singh...
all day we have been
looking for a place on rent
- Have you been refused?
- Yes Master
Who has refused you?
Tell me his name
I'll sing the song of thunder!
I'll send him shockwaves
Who dares?
I ask who dares?
Tell me who you are
Who refuses to
accommodate my disciples?
Get one thing clear!
My disciples are
going to live with me
And they will hear
my songs everyday
Boys...
Where are those boys?
Close up
Wait, let it dry
Don't you dare try to get too close
Not blessings, we can
only wish ill of you
Daddy, you're repairing
that junk forever.
Why won't you sell it?
The constant companion of my youth!
Don't call it junk.
But who'll buy it?
Uncle Jassi.
It's my birthday.
I thought I'd bring some sweets
and ask for your blessings.
- Balli...
- Yes sir?
- Go and get it.
- What, sir?
- Sir!
- Do what I told you.
- Please... have some.
- Wait, what's the hurry?
He's bringing my blessings.
- So today's your birthday?
- Yes Uncle
- What's your sun sign?
- Gemini
Two faces, no?
- What's that? Sanctified water?
- Poison
- Uncle?
- Son of a gun!
Your parents disgraced us!
Your sweets are like poison to us.
He wasn't asking for our property!
All he wanted were blessings.
- Nothing's nice in this house!
- What is the matter?
You take care of your house.
I'm going
- Where to?
- To the temple. I'll pray for Raja
If my husband asks say I've
gone to the beauty parlour.
Offerings
What's the old man doing here?
Today's my grandson's birthday.
Say a nice prayer
for his long life.
Where did this old
woman transpire from?
- Whom did you call "old woman"?
- No! I said...
"Where did this doll
transpire from?"
And what's my doll doing here?
I'm just praying to
The Lord our Father
In the temple of
The Mother Goddess?
No! Not The Lord!
I'm praying to The Mother Goddess
Praying to The Mother Goddess?
For Raja?
Yes, I'm praying for Raja
Then come, let's pray together.
Here, the holy fire.
Brothers, today is my
grandson's birthday
Eat your fill and give him
your heartfelt blessings.
Won't you give me some, Grandpa?
Won't you?
Yes, son.
- Come son, sit.
- Sit
It's bodes well to sit on
the steps of the temple.
He has taken after our Anjali.
Eyes, especially.
Ditto Anjali
When she smiled, her eyes narrowed.
Look, just like hers.
Does your mother think of us?
All day, she talks only about you.
We miss her too.
But this Jassi makes life hell for us.
He won't even let us speak of her!
No matter.
Now you're here, son.
We will overcome.
In you, we see our Anjali.
Won't you give him
something to eat?
No Grannie, please
- So much sweet! I'll put on weight.
- You must
If you become fat, you'll
become even more cuddly.
Just a little soup.
Come on Grandma...
I should be the one
cooking for you.
The joy is in watching you eat.
See? The joy and the blessing,
it's all mine. Double profit
You talk just like your father.
I want his address.
- What for?
- The Johnsons in Delhi...
are related to us.
They have a daughter. Young, beautiful
- I want her to marry...
- To marry?
You... no, not you.
I want her to marry you
- Marry me?
- That's the only way...
...you can come into my family.
Your father married a Hindu girl.
Everyone in the family hates him.
If you marry a Christian girl...
...slowly people will
take a liking to you
Even Moses will accept you.
Shall I talk to Johnson?
- Grandma... I?
- Any problem?
- No, no problem.
- Then?
She isn't for you.
Grandpa's outside!
If he sees me here, he'll kill me.
Do I get out of the window?
I'll take the backdoor
Grandpa, you? I knew you'd come.
Come inside
This dog was after me.
That's why I came here
- What dog? I don't see any dog.
- You can't. It was a black dog.
If you bark like a dog,
I'll kill you like a dog.
Come inside Grandpa, please
I'm not going in there.
What are you, some king?
Or is this some palace
I've come to see?
- I'm not going inside.
- Grandpa, what are you carrying?
I brought it for you. Sweets.
Today's your birthday
Grandpa, was it the dog, or was
it your love that drew you here?
You beware of him.
Welcome
Make yourselves comfortable.
Over there. I'll call Raja
Raja... get up son.
Lots of fruits have arrived.
And lots of sweets.
Why are you dragging
me out so early?
- They are here to see you.
- To see me?
- Not you. They're here to see you.
- Yes son.
Before that Rosie talks you into
marrying Johnson's daughter...
...I want you to marry
into our community.
- Me?
- Yes
- The other hand.
- You've had it
I heard
- So how do you like our Raja?
- As handsome as a slice of Moon.
Slice of Moon?
Oh, he's just out of bed.
After a bath, he's
"Moon in full bloom"
- Who's that beside him?
- The crater on the Moon.
Some for my ears too?
If you insult me again...
I'll tape your song and
I'll play it till you die.
I never heard that.
- He got it.
Grandma and Grannie!
Must do something.
I'm dead
Is that stupid lady here with
a marriage proposal for you?
That old hag has gone senile.
She has been blabbering all day
Don't you fall for what she says
I've finalised the match for you
- Yes Grannie?
- You'll marry the girl I choose.
- She's one in a million.
- Sure
One minute
You'll marry the girl I choose!
She's one in a billion.
I'm in a soup!
And you're behaving as if
you're here on a tourist visa?
- What can I do?
- At least say something.
- What are you doing?
- You just said, say something.
- I asked for advise! Help me!
- Take that, get off my back.
- What's this?
- Coin. Toss.
You say yes to one,
I'll say yes to the other.
- I can't say yes to either of them!
- Why?
- In that case, just say it...
- Should I?
Grandma and Grannie,
I am married.
Son, how could you get married
without even informing us?
- And why break the news so suddenly?
- I met her suddenly
I fell in love suddenly,
we got married suddenly.
- So I had to say it suddenly.
- She's a Hindu, no?
- Must be Christian, no?
- Neither Hindu, nor Christian.
- She's Hindustani.
- Hindustan music I heard of.
- What's this Hindustani creed?
- There's no greater religion.
Like Raja's parents...
...her mother is Hindu,
her father is a Christian.
- Therefore Hindustani, no?
- Forget it, what's her name?
- Name?
- Yes
- What's her name?
- Banto
- Banto?
- Betty
- She's Hindu, she's Christian too.
- Lovely name.
"Love flows forth from music,
making me hum this tune"
"Why not sing along?
Sing along, o'heart"
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"
"To my song, my
heart beats a rhythm"
Bless you.
He sings like me, no?
Wait... where are you going?
He's my disciple. I taught him.
But son, the crescendo was far
from perfect. But never mind.
Get lost.
Tomorrow morning, I'll teach you
how to flit though the scales.
Your voice is as ugly
as your looks are good.
Follow me.
That's the chord, now sing.
- Raja, a letter for you.
- What are you doing?
I'm teaching you!
How can you leave?
- End of the practice!
- Why?
Olden custom. If a letter arrives
in the middle of a session...
...that's the end of the practice.
- Whose letter is it?
- His wife. Banto Betty's
Banto Betty?
How come?
What will you do when she comes?
- Lucky, what the hell is this?
- I wrote it and I posted it.
To convince them that you
are cent percent married.
What are you doing out there?
Read the letter, what's in it?
Reading uncle, reading
"Please accept your
wife's loving greetings"
"I'm fine and I suspect
you must be fine too"
"I'm not worried one bit for
you. Because I'm sure..."
"the wonderful Lucky is
taking wonderful care of you"
"I'm lucky that you
have a friend like him"
You are Raja's friend. Why does
his wife consider herself lucky?
- Affection Uncle, affection.
- Some infection.
"I know how unhappy you must
be staying away from me"
"I'm unhappy too,
because Lucky is so far away"
What's going on?
Whose wife wrote that? Yours or his?
As between us,
we don't differentiate.
His wife or mine, she's all ours.
I'll read the rest.
"Darling, our Pinky
has littered again"
"Let me know what you
want the pup named"
Ghuman Uncle means so much for us.
Why don't we name him Ghuman?
See? People proudly name their
sons after me. Son, who's Pinky?
- His wife's pet bitch.
- I never heard that.
- I'll read the rest.
- No! You can't.
- Why not?
- The rest is private.
- As between man and wife.
- You mean, it's like that?
Lucky, how long will we keep
posting letters full of lies?
We ought to get out of here...
...before we get
into worse problems
Here we are.
Hey, brake!
Will you please help
me with my luggage?
Keep the tip.
Where does Ghuman
Singh Rathore live?
One minute...
I'm Ghuman Singh Rathore.
Who are you?
Uncle! My obeisances.
- Raja! Your wife is here!
- Wife?
- Banto Betty is your wife, isn't she?
- Banto Betty?
- Hurry! She's waiting for you.
- Where did she transpire from?
- My hand is stuck!
- Come unstuck.
- But it won't come unstuck!
- Then leave it behind.
- Leave my right hand behind?
- Will you come along?
But how do I go?
Raja... listen...
Where are you taking the letter box?
My job is at stake!
I've two wives to feed.
Didn't I tell you he'd come
running to me like Milkha Singh?
How are you dear?
Why are you staring me down?
Oh I see! You are wondering...
...how I landed
up all of a sudden!
I wanted to give you a surprise.
So I didn't write
that I'm coming.
Nor did I write that.
What's wrong with you?
You're as thin as a reed.
- Lucky, doesn't he look feeble?
- No, he was fine.
- Your arrival has changed him.
- Strange! Won't you even react?
Raja! Will you talk to your
wife in public view? Go in.
Coming Uncle.
Come on dear.
Wait.
Who are you?
How are we related?
It doesn't befit a husband
to ask such questions...
...to his wife in public.
- Wife? Whose wife?
- No, son.
You don't talk to
your wife like that.
Who's she? I don't know
her Never seen her before!
What?
My child, you say something...
...he says quite something
else... what's up?
Because we've been
apart for a month...
...we aren't husband
and wife anymore?
- What justice is this?
- She says she is my wife?
- Does she have any proof?
- Yes, do you have any proof?
The vows I took with him,
are they any less proof?
The food I cooked for him,
is that any less proof?
- Did you videotape all that?
- Tape?
- Yes, videotapes are in vogue.
- To hell with tapes.
Proof number one, is before you.
Live
Proof number two, is before me.
Live
You expect me to prove?
Like in old Hindi movies?
That his ring and
mine are the same?
That he has a black mole
on his back? No Uncle.
I'm modern, I'm confident!
And I've seen new age movies.
- So tell me. Am I your wife?
- You aren't.
- Uncle, where's the well?
- Are you thirsty?
No, I feel like drowning myself.
No, confident girls like
you don't drown themselves.
You drown others!
Drown him.
No my confidence is shattered!
I'll drown myself.
- No, at your age you have fun.
- No, I got to drown.
Stop! I know your problem.
And I've made him out.
Pick up her luggage and come in.
Come my child.
Beautiful room! Picture windows!
And hills! And creepers.
There's still time.
Tell me, who are you?
What remains to be told?
I'm your wife, you're my husband.
Stop talking nonsense! I know
how to shake off girls like you.
You want to get rid of me?
I know! In my absence...
...you took a mistress into my bedroom!
- You mustn't cry.
- Lucky, my brother...
- Brother?
Lucky, aren't you his friend?
At least, you can help me.
- Ask him why he's doing this!
- Why are you doing this?
Sometimes in life...
...you got to accept wife as
wife even if wife isn't wife.
- Why should I accept?
- One hand stuck in the mailbox.
If the other hand gets
stuck somewhere between...
...husband and wife, how do I eat?
Whom did you call husband-and-wife?
See, this is my problem.
She's yours.
I'll go out and solve mine,
in here you solve your problem.
Lucky's gone.
Why not shut the door?
Out of windows...
...watch brown-brown trees.
And talk romantic-type things?
How about?
My foot.
I bloody lost myself long ago.
- Pull.
- I'm pulling.
"Love flows forth from music...
...making me hum this tune"
"Why not sing along?
Sing along, o'heart"
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"
Hey! How come you know this song?
How strange!
How can I not know?
When you were courting me
that was the song you sang.
Brother Lucky, tell us...
...can a wife not know
her husband's preferences?
- Glory to the lady!
- Shut up.
Came off!
It came off!
Raja... he's off too?
"Love flows forth from music...
...making me hum this tune"
"Why not sing along?...
...Sing along, o'heart"
"Dreams turn to melody.
Sing along, o'heart"
"To my song, my
heart beats a rhythm"
"Sometimes, when you
and I are together..."
"let there be music in our words"
"Sometimes, let there
be glorious days..."
"of colourful evenings
and glittering nights"
"Sometimes, let a waft
carry new colours of love"
"Sometimes, let's
forget this world"
"Sometimes, let's live our dreams"
"Let's reach for the skies"
"Come unto me, my love"
"Love beckons us"
"Love flows forth from music...
...making me hum this tune"
"Why not sing along?"
"Sing along, o'heart"
"Dreams turn to melody"
"Sing along, o'heart"
"To my song, my
heart beats a rhythm"
"Sometimes in passion...
...let's get drenched
in these rains"
"Sometimes in emotions...
...let's drown ourselves"
"I don't care...
...if anyone thinks we're mad"
"I don't care if they wonder"
"Why you and I are like this"
"Why we're lost"
"Why we're so silent"
"I don't care if they
can't understand"
"Love flows forth from music...
...making me hum this tune"
"Why not sing along?"
"Sing along, o'heart"
"Dreams turn to melody"
"Sing along, o'heart"
"To my song...
...my heart beats a rhythm"
Don't touch it!
All this trouble is
all because of you.
If I could, wouldn't I find
such pretty trouble for myself?
Soon I'm going to be
called an uncle...
...and I haven't
found an aunt yet.
I like all of them, not
one of them likes me.
Who's she looking for?
Look!
Whom are they looking for?
Will someone tell me
what's so lovely upstairs?
Lucky, you understand?
Both the families are
eager to see your wife.
- Both families. Anything else?
- Next...
...folks in the neighbourhood.
We ought to sell tickets.
We can bring the families close...
...on the pretext of
introducing the bride.
Bride?
One other thing, Lucky.
We won't use the ploy.
- Why Raja?
- Because she's brainless.
Indecorous.
Insolent.
She's a mischief-maker.
Given that sanction...
...she will become my wife.
I'm not going to tolerate her.
Besides, she isn't even educated.
She's no match for Raja!
Are you dancing in the rain?
You got to be mad enough to do it.
Where are my certificates?
- Uncle, who took my certificates?
- Shut up!
I know of nothing outside music.
Banto cleaned the drawers.
She might know.
Where have you kept
my certificates?
- You mean those pieces of paper?
- Pieces of paper?
Strange! And I thought you're
intelligent enough to know...
...that trash goes
in the garbage can.
Trash? Oh, you'd never know...
...what labours went
into those certificates.
You're right. I'm a brainless,
indecorous, stupid thing.
How would I know
certificates from trash.
- So...
- So?
I wanted to make a fire for
tanning Ghuman's percussions.
- No, you never did that!
- No I thought...
I'd put the certificates on fire.
But you never did that?
- Why should I tell you?
- Tell me or I'll strangle you!
I'll tell you!
Oh there comes Ghuman Uncle.
- Help!
- I'm not going to spare you!
I'm no Raja unless I strangle you!
- Are you Banto Betty's husband?
- Who said?
She said that the guy standing
like a servant at the door...
...is her husband
- Did she say that?
Get these medicines.
It's just a sprain, nothing else.
Will I recover by tonight?
By tonight, you'll be
dancing like Madhuri Dixit.
No, I'm a Sridevi fan.
Heartless savages!
She danced like a doe!
She has lost her
leg because of you!
Can you replace that leg?
How? Had it been a chicken leg...
What did you say?
- I would've sacrificed an extra.
- Shut up!
I can have you jailed!
No! Don't!
I won't be able to pay for bail.
Besides, my life's
philosophy is to love...
"Give him love even if he is cruel"
Even I feel like singing.
Despite your antics,
she's on your side.
That's the ideal woman.
Wonderful, my child.
Such a lofty ideal,
such simple words.
No ideal.
That was a song in a movie.
- Don't jump out of your pants.
- He's wearing shorts.
Incorrigible, are you?
What do I do with these guys?
Don't worry, my child.
I won't have them sent to jail.
I'll have them thrown out.
Out of this house.
You'll render us homeless?
Now who's cruel? You or I?
I... no you.
Listen... if they ever play
dirty again... just sing Uncle.
And I'll do what I
can possibly never do.
Excuse me, it's time
for my singing practice.
Listen...
Will you come over here, please?
- Yes, what is it?
- One... two... three...
- Cut it out.
- First, will you tell me whether...
...they ought to be
washed separately.
Looks like polyester.
- A detergent wash will do, right?
- Yes
Then do that.
I mean, buy some detergent,
wash them, put them out to dry.
- Your clothes?
- We wash them?
Is someone's absence
not being felt?
- Not at all
- Uncle's absence?
Before I call out to him, think.
How would it be if you're homeless?
- No one else will put us up.
- Yes, uncles' orders.
Then we're banished!
Madam, let's have the clothes,
let's not waste time.
My veil...
- Came away with the laundry.
- No problem.
Look at this lovely design.
- I like this one.
- Sorry, she's taken it already.
Raja! How come you're here?
Must've walked into a
boutique looking for a shave?
She too?
Grannie! You're here?
- My respects.
- What are you doing here?
Select a dress.
I'll pay for it.
- How much is this?
- 635 Rupees.
- Less how much discount?
- It doesn't qualify for discount
purchases of 1000 and above.
- Shopping done?
- Yes, this is worth 800.
Just 800?
You won't get a discount.
No problem, put it on my bill.
- What for?
- Just do it.
Grandma, put that on my bill.
Will you bill all these together?
Why together?
- What are you upto?
- Have patience. Hurry, please.
Here's your dress.
And this is yours.
Your dress is worth 800.
Here's your discount. 200 Rupees.
Yours is worth 635.
Discount, 158.75. Here you are.
Wonderful! You've saved
Grandma-Grannie, that was peanuts.
If you can go through
life together...
...there will be big gains.
Think about it.
- Raja, is tea ready?
- Boiling.
- Have you given her medicine?
- I'll do it right away.
Raja, you're looking frustrated.
Why don't you take something?
- Take what?
- Poison.
Raja, I feel like crying for you.
Here you are, holed
up with a crackpot.
And a girl comes out of nowhere
and latches on to you...
...and you end up washing,
cooking for her.
In life you got to struggle a bit.
Until such time
that she recovers...
...till she begins walking,
I'd rather say jumping...
- I go to do this, no?
- She is jumping.
- God! Am I dreaming?
- Reality.
Aren't you ashamed?
You faked that limp.
And here you are,
on the terrace, skipping.
- Because you work miracles.
- What did you say?
"Maverick"
"You're maverick, I'm maverick..."
"Maverick because of you"
"I've given myself to you"
"Let me walk with you"
"Colour me in your hues"
"Maverick-maverick"
"You're king, I'm queen.
I'm as fun-loving as you are"
"You're my paramour,
you drive me crazy..."
"I know who you are,
you're my heartbeat"
"You're my beloved,
I pine for you"
"Colour me in your hues"
"Maverick-maverick"
"Come home to me, my love.
An easterly wind is scorching me"
"Hear my love, the chime in
my anklets, in my bangles..."
"...call out to you"
"For your sake I'm a maverick"
"Maverick-maverick"
"For your sake I suffer"
"Maverick-maverick"
"What craze drives me to
passion even after I'm sated?"
"Now that you've taken
me in your arms..."
"...set me afire.
Colour me in your hues"
"Maverick-maverick"
"Don't love me so much,
you crazy girl..."
"...lest our romance..."
"...becomes the legend..."
"...of the girl who
gave up everything..."
"...and she left her home..."
"...to become a maverick"
"Now she's so lost in love..."
"...she has created..."
"...a legend anew"
"You're maverick, I'm maverick..."
"Maverick because of you"
"I've given myself to you"
"Let me walk with you"
"Colour me in your hues"
"Maverick-maverick"
After accidents, people
end up in hospitals.
You end up dreaming?
Lucky for me, I might've
ended up in jail.
Rise, madam.
That dance must've been tiring.
Go home, rest yourself.
No, I'm not tired at all.
Lucky, I'm in a strange dilemma.
She started out playing wife.
What's this woman getting me into?
You deserve it.
- Hit me once more... idea!
- What?
If she insists she's your wife,
what's holding you back?
I don't get it.
For the first time,
you've given me a great idea!
If you weren't smelly,
I would've hugged you.
Why are they carrying in flowers?
Will you please
plait my hair first?
"Let it rain flowers,
my beloved has come to me"
Looks like a bed
for a nuptial night!
It's meant for the nuptial night.
- Nuptial night? Whose?
- Ours. Yours and mine.
Really?
- What? Ours?
- Who else? Ghuman Uncle's?
Aunt, it's been 3 months
since we got married.
But we haven't had
our nuptial night
- Actually, they forgot.
- Unbelievable, no?
Come on Lucky, we've work to do.
Never had the nuptial night?
No wonder the two of you
fight like cats and dogs.
- Actually...
- This is no good, my child.
You're right. Will you help her
get dressed for our first night?
- Yes, come on.
- You don't know a thing.
I sent them away to watch a movie.
The movie is nearly over,
and my movie is still to begin.
- How right!
- Then ask her to get dressed.
Here's the bride's trousseau
and a make-up pack. For her.
- Lucky, flowers done?
- Done.
Oh no...
- One minute!
- Don't forget the lipstick!
- I won't.
- Come on.
- How do I explain this?
- Stop it!
- Oh come on.
Now look at her.
- Ready?
- Aunt...
Not a word.
What are you doing here?
Come on, out.
Aunt!
- What do you intend doing?
- Whatever husband does to wife.
You fancy being wife?
Come, let's make a wife out of you.
Please! Don't touch me!
I beg of you.
I lied about being your wife!
If you want,
I'll say it to everyone.
May I know why you did all this?
Miss Universe crown
or a gold medal...
...a girl will wear anything,
but not the wedding necklace...
...not unless she is married,
in observance of the rituals.
Tell me the truth.
Who are you, why this melodrama?
- Why are you fooling everyone?
- If I'm fooling people...
...what are you upto?
Have you not deceived them?
You claim to be Anjali's
son, their grandson?
What nonsense are you talking?
Do you know the others in
this photograph with me?
- No.
- Have you ever seen them before?
- No.
- They are Anjali and Anthony.
The ones whose son
you are impersonating
Anjali and Anthony never had a son.
They have an only daughter.
That's me!
My real name isn't Banto.
I'm Tina.
Now tell me who you are.
Even my grandparents
haven't kept track...
...of my parents for
the last 27 years.
But we were always aware of
whatever was happening to them.
Do you know how?
Only one man rose to their support...
...while everyone in the village
was against their marriage.
Ghuman Uncle.
Never did we miss one
letter from Ghuman Uncle.
No one in the village...
...not even his wife knew
that he was writing to us.
He was the one who told us all
about you, including that song.
Now explain one thing.
Despite being a granddaughter...
...I never thought of bringing
the families together.
How come you?
Someone who is unrelated?
Why are you so anxious?
I mean...
...what makes someone with
such a grand personality...
...give up whatever he was doing?
Why're you here in this village?
Why so far removed from the city?
What's the truth?
- Truth?
- Yes, truth.
- The truth is somewhat strange.
- Strange?
Somewhat strange, somewhat bizarre.
Why not lay it straight? It's fat.
What do you mean?
This persona wasn't always grand.
He was somewhat of a comedian,
sweet, romantic, innocent, musical.
Yes Tina, like the flower,
I have a colourful past...
...I never knew a family.
Until a few months ago,
Raja was a different man.
Shapeless, heavy, gargantuan.
I knew I was nothing of a hero.
But in my heart, I had carved
out a place for a heroine.
At first sight, I felt,
here's life's quintessence.
She was the one I was
always looking for.
She was so frivolous, so innocent.
She didn't even know that a
sweet romantic hulk has a heart.
And there was that
only song I sang.
"If you got love in your life,
you got everything"
"If you got no love..."
"...you got nothing"
"If you got love in your eyes..."
"...you got everything"
"If you got no love..."
"...you've got nothing"
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"
"Just give it a try"
"Even dreams come true"
"The world isn't a bad place"
"There are nice souls on earth"
"If you got the desire..."
"you got everything"
"If not the desire..."
"...you got nothing"
"If you got love in your life..."
"...you got everything"
"If you got no love..."
"...you got nothing"
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"
- Where are you going?
- Inside the hostel...
- There's a girl singing!
- So?
I got to see her!
Boys can't enter a girls'
hostel without permission.
I live in the neighbourhood
and she's singing my song.
- I'll be right back.
- Out... out!
God, You are my father,
my godfather.
I majored in the arts and sciences.
And then I mastered music.
But You have not provided
me with a job yet.
I'm going for an interview again
God, please let me have the job.
Oblations.
Help! I'm about to score
a big zero in maths.
- Your paper!
- Don't worry, I have more
This is the answer
according to my notes.
But my answer is
quite something else.
- Maybe the book is wrong?
- Do something! Help me.
I'm about to fail my term!
Don't do like this.
What's the answer?
Why isn't my mind working?
It came back?
Who solved it?
- You?
- Not I, the guy in blue.
The one in the blue?
Listen... Mr Blue.
Aren't you the one in the
neighbourhood who writes songs?
But my problem is something
else, I need your help
But I'm getting late...
I got an exam!
I'm about to fail.
- Your books...
- Sorry, you fell because of me.
- No, you fell because of me.
- Wonderful! We both fell.
I'm Florence. I live in the
hostel in front of your house.
I'm Raja, I live in the house
in front of your hostel.
Wonderful!
We live in front of each other.
Here's my stop.
The interviews are over.
I got delayed trying
to help someone.
If you try to help others rather
of helping yourself, you lose.
No, helping others is better
than helping yourself.
- Will you see my certificates?
- What for? Get lost.
Very well.
Think! If we can't win the music
contest, we're in disgrace.
You maxed the maths paper.
- We got a new problem now.
- Why not get Raja to solve this?
- Raja! Give up praying!
- What's your problem Lucky?
- The moneylender is calling his loan.
- Now what?
You got the brains, you think.
What about my money?
Not up in the morning,
have a heart.
My heart goes out to you!
But there's something I got to say.
Not a word!
Everytime you send me packing.
- This time, I'll go packing.
- After you've returned my money.
Look, I'm going for an interview.
As soon as I land a job...
...I'll return your money.
- We'll even lend to you
- At two percent!
- Very good rate.
What guarantee you'll bag a job?
Here's guarantee.
He has majored in arts,
sciences and music.
Few have as many merit
certificates as he has.
Will the certificates
ensure the job?
Hundred percent!
You can take the file back
after you return my money.
- Stop! Please! Don't do this!
- If you don't pay me in 2 days...
- I'll burn this file!
- This is a matter of my career.
My certificates!
My life's work... please.
Lucky, we're going
through a bad patch.
Looks like bad stars.
I can't find a job and I got to
pay the moneylender & milkman.
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Which?
House rent.
This is worse than the worst
introduction in Hindi movies.
Get lost!
This is no way to
get rid of people.
- Looks like he hasn't paid rent.
- Poor guy.
Nothing of the sort.
I pay 5,000 every month.
- Shut up!
- But what's his mistake?
Not mistake, call it crime.
All day he bores us
with his sick stories.
Wants to go to Bombay, write films.
And all night, he snores.
Are you throwing him out over
something so trivial? Too bad!
I'd rather sell my house
than let him live with me.
Get lost! Yours isn't
the only house in town.
- Cash finds me another place.
- Go on, do it.
- Sir, you want a house?
- You got one?
Yes, but I didn't bring the
house along. Will a cottage do?
Anything will do, this is
a matter of my prestige.
- We're already living there.
- No problem, I'll adjust.
Do you have a fan?
- Not fan, fans.
- Separate bathrooms?
- The room is in the bathroom.
- One minute...
Excuse me.
Lucky, are you out of your mind?
You'll let him live with us?
Only as long as he's worth it.
First, we take a 5,000 advance
And we pay Khan off.
And we make him foot the rent.
He pays rent, we keep the place.
Welcome to our heaven!
Where are the fans?
He's an Abhishek Bachchan fan &
the landlord is the maid's fan
Damn! This ruin costs 1,500 a month
and 5,000 advance? Goodbye!
- Hey film star...
- Yes?
This was where the greatest
of directors sat down...
...to write their greatest stories.
- They came here?
- Then you surely know them?
- Of course I do.
They won't know us but
that's besides the point.
What kind of an
acquaintance is that?
He means someday you'll
become a big film writer.
You got me a bit emotional.
Here's your advance.
Thank you very much.
- Come on Lucky, we made it.
- What was that he said?
Let's get the certificates back.
- Raja, here's your file
- Where did you find this file?
Florence gave it to me.
"If you got love in your life..."
"...you got everything"
"If you got no love..."
"...you got nothing"
"If you got love in your eyes..."
"...you got everything"
"If you have no love..."
"...you've got nothing"
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"
She was rehearsing here a while
ago. Maybe in her college.
- In college?
- Yes.
"Some fragrance on my breath..."
"some restlessness this season..."
"some flower will blossom in
my heart, whispers someone"
"If spring has come to your
Eden you got everything"
"If the Spring hasn't come,
you got nothing"
"If you got love in your life..."
"...you got everything"
"Love... love... love...
- There is no one here.
- Where must they be?
- 3 tickets.
- Three? For whom?
One for you, two for him.
"Some dream stirs within me..."
"some passion is aroused..."
"loneliness is no more..."
"the season of love beckons"
"If spring makes the bud
blossom you got everything"
"If there's no blossom,
you got nothing"
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"
Now I talk to Florence.
- May I talk to Florence?
- One minute.
Get lost.
Florence, I'm Raja from
across your hostel.
You know I was feted
at the college.
I ought to be thankful to you
for retrieving my certificates.
No! I ought to be thankful!
Thanks to your song,
I got the first prize.
I sang it at home.
You took it to TV, you've
taken it all over the country.
Florence, can I meet you?
Outside the hostel gates?
I'll be right over.
- Yes?
- About my certificates...
Here's the money you paid for them.
Why are you returning this?
Borrowing makes a
stranger, it's said.
With Khan it's different I
don't want us to be estranged.
Nor do I wish it.
I'll accept it.
One minute...
Thanks to you,
I passed maths But...
Other weak subjects? Which?
- All of them
- All? Oh God!
Actually, the lectures are boring.
By the time I'm
attentive again...
...it's time for the exams.
There's very little time left &
the nervousness makes me dumb.
Oh what might you
be thinking of me?
I'm so utterly worthless.
No you aren't, because that's
the critique of the self.
That means you'll help me
with the rest of my subjects?
Sure.
- What are you discussing?
- Dream girls.
Tell us, what kind of
a guy would you like?
I don't go for looks. Whatever
the looks, whatever the size...
...he must be good at heart.
And most importantly...
...he must be brilliant!
Intelligent enough to
leave me dumbfounded.
Hey fatso, can't you watch it?
- Whom did you call fatso?
- He's fat. So I called fatso.
Remember, if you laugh at someone
who's fat, you're a fathead.
Someone who's fat can slim down.
But what do you do about
your brains, fathead?
Whom did you call a fatso?
My Raja is fat and that's
what he did to you.
What'd happen to you
if he was in shape?
My Raja is fat and that's
what he did to you.
What'd happen to you
if he was in shape?
Raja, what are you upto? Breaking
coconuts or breaking the temple?
- Coconuts.
- What gives?
No more going to bed hungry,
no more borrowing.
No more tramping,
I've found a job.
- Job?
- Yes, a job!
Now find a nice girl
and get married, fast.
- Why go looking, there's a girl.
- Who?
Look Raja, you like Florence.
Florence likes you.
Before she leaves for vacations,
proposition her.
My intentions are quite different.
Before she returns
after holidays...
...I want to make
myself worthy of her.
Just pray to God that
she is given to me.
"Tell me o'heart
you surely know..."
"...how do I get my girl?"
"Oh how do I get her?"
"I'm in love with a girl"
"Will she love me?"
"In the images in my dreams..."
"will she add a touch of colour?"
"Will it ever come to be?"
"What will be the outcome?"
"Good or bad?"
"Tell me o'heart you surely know"
"My heart's desire..."
"...will it be fulfilled?"
"I'm crazy about someone"
"...will she be mine?"
"Will we walk together
hand in hand?"
"What will happen in the end?"
"O'heart, don't hide it from me"
"Tell me o'heart you surely know"
- Hi Mr Writer!
- Back from the holidays?
- Where's Raja?
- Nowadays he vanishes early.
- Vanishes?
- Yes.
I'm throwing a party tomorrow.
All of you are invited.
Florence, can't you stay
back to look up Raja?
To look up Raja?
But I've looked him up already.
No Florence, I mean, maybe
you could talk face-to-face.
We'll do that.
Tomorrow.
What was that about
looking him up?
Raja, why didn't you come up?
You could've proposed today.
No, Florence is right.
Tomorrow.
For such occasions... you
need the right costume...
...right lighting, right location.
- Where's Raja?
- You know, in Hindi movies...
...the hero makes a grand entry.
Cut out the jokes, where is Raja?
You... how did you manage this?
This calls for a
double celebration!
I'll be back... one minute
Are you ready?
Say it, as soon as she comes.
- Who's here?
- Raja! I told you, no?
This is Raja, the one
who used to teach me.
You can't describe him as
anything less than brilliant.
And here's the guy whose
birthday we're celebrating.
Ranjit, my fiance.
Florence made her grades
because of you. Else...
...we wouldn't have been
married for another two years.
So Raja, how's my choice?
Aren't we made for each other?
Isn't he tall,
dashing and handsome.
Just like you said
Mr Right should be?
But in reply, you said
quite something else.
And that's why Raja...
My compliments.
Sorry Florence, I got
nothing to give you.
I wish you told me
about the occasion...
- My best wishes...
- I know I have your best wishes.
She knows nothing.
- Do you think Raja will agree?
- I'll bring him around.
It's me, Florence.
- Why is she here so early?
- Raja teach her a lesson.
- Shut up and get dressed.
- Ruined my sleep.
- What brings you here so early?
- Raja, I need your help.
We're getting married tomorrow,
without our parents consent.
I have no one else but you.
I want you to be a witness.
If you sign as witness, it'll be
your best gift for my wedding.
If my signature is what makes
you happy, I'll surely do it.
Ranjit didn't I tell you
that Raja will concede?
Florence, one minute.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure, ask.
You have a family.
Then why this registered marriage?
Because our families
will never give consent.
But why?
with Florence's uncle.
Ever since, our families
have been at loggerheads.
It's your responsibility
to patch those differences.
You must not make the chasm wider.
I don't think it is nice...
...to hurt your parents who
reared you for 20 years...
...for the sake of
a 20-month affair.
We don't want a bit of that.
But reasoning with our
families is impossible.
I'll make it possible,
I'll bring the families together.
I'll make sure that you're
married in their presence.
Don't you trust me?
Absolutely.
Florence insists that only Raja
can help failures succeed.
I say, only Raja can
turn hatred into love.
We'll be going.
Are you out of your mind?
You know she isn't
going to be yours.
Why must you do all this for her?
Lucky, loving is about giving.
Loving only someone who
belongs to me is narcissus.
In grief for the woman he loved,
an emperor built the Taj Mahal.
Men have died for love,
legends galore.
But this example of
so unique a gift...
...for the girl you
are losing is rare.
I thought of love
as only an emotion.
But now that I know
your intentions...
...I find a new respect for love.
All I will say is, from now on
your purpose is my purpose too.
Till such time that you succeed,
I will stand beside you.
Only one request.
For a while keep to yourself the fact...
...that I'm no grandson to
the Chaddhas and D'souzas.
I know everything.
You're a fraud playing grandson.
He heard story-screenplay
dialogues, the works.
Yes! Now I'll tell my
boss all about it and...
...I'm going to make
a film out of it.
Like someone who...
...watches movies for free & then
threatens to leak the suspense?
- Wait!
- Boss...
Lucky! Make sure he doesn't say!
Everything could be in a mess!
Get him!
Stop!
No, if I stop, you'll catch me.
That's why I'm asking you to stop.
- What happened?
- He molested a girl.
Molestation?
Raped a girl!
Now he's getting away.
He raped and murdered a girl.
Now he's getting away.
Murder?
I molested a girl, I raped
her and I murdered her.
But how could I
have done all three?
Must tell the boss all about it.
No need for worry, he'll be
speechless for only 3 months.
Worrisome would've been
his ability to speak.
If he can't, no worries.
But he will start speaking, slowly.
For me, that's enough.
In this state is
drinking permissible?
Drinking? No.
You want a drink?
One drink is not enough?
You need a full bottle?
No, if this is the
way you behave...
...you won't even get
water for 3 months.
That was a wonderful thing to do
Now the road lies clear ahead.
And the target is in sight.
No cakes? Then I got to go to
town for the birthday cake.
The accident happened here.
How come the sound
is coming from there?
Grandpa.
You take care of that.
I'll take care of this.
Where are you headed?
Hi Grandpa! All dressed and
pushing the scooter? Where to?
You expect me to strip and
carry the scooter on my head?
- What happened to it?
- Tuberculosis.
- Tuberculosis?
- Out of gas.
- I know.
- What?
I mean, you should've checked
the gas before setting out.
- Give that to me.
- No...
You're old, Grandpa.
- The gas station is 5 kms away.
- What?
Five.
- Grandpa, are you all right?
- Perfectly.
- What happened?
- Grandpa D'souza's car.
Looks like a bad accident.
Must be dead.
Hundred percent.
- Careful.
- The old fool is alive.
- Grandpa, how do we go home?
- Walking.
You're old, Grandpa.
Home is 5 kilometers away.
- What?
- Five.
Goodness! I've had two
heart attacks already.
- What are you saying?
- Five kilometers on foot...
...won't take me home.
I'll end up there.
Grandpa! Idea!
You won't have to walk.
- What's wrong with the scooter?
- Just run out of gas.
What's the problem?
The car is full of gas. Just fill up.
- Why should I give him my gas?
- Alms.
- Alms?
- We don't need your alms.
We don't even take alms for free.
If you give us gas...
...we'll give you
a free lift home.
Yes, a lift... oh no, no.
Am I to give this old fool a lift?
Never.
Don't put on airs.
No matter how hungry he is,
the tiger never eats grass.
If he's tiger, this is lion!
He'll even kill his kin.
But he will never accept defeat!
Not even if it's a
matter of life and death.
I'm man enough.
You're only man.
I got an additional qualification.
I'm a son of Punjab.
I'm resolute. I stand my ground.
Raja, I'm short of breath.
You tell him the rest.
Be man enough, be resolute.
Ever since, he hasn't kept track
of her. Can you be more resolute
So what? He too hasn't
contacted his son ever since.
He doesn't even know
whether he's dead or alive.
Is that any less resolute?
Yes Grandpa?
He won't even help a dying
friend who's turned against him.
He will let him die thirsting
for a drop of water.
But he won't care
for the friendship.
In the name of religion
he will fight...
...he'll kill a friend.
He is slave to his resolution.
Shut up! I'm no slave
to intransigence.
The ones who enslave us...
...the one who deny us
our freedom are our sons.
Despite all my wishes,
I cannot meet her.
D'souza, I got no
complaints against you.
Scooter recharged.
Recharge your friendship.
The two of you make a
wonderful pair of friends.
- Shall we go?
- Yes.
What happened?
Why are you getting off midway?
In movies, there's
only one villain.
In real life, we
have 2 villains, no?
Right! If they see us together...
...they'll kill us
with a single bullet.
Don't say such ominous things!
We rode a scooter
together after 27 years.
And it was great fun.
Why are you so impatient?
What is the matter?
"Mr Chaddha,
Raja isn't your grandson"
- What's written in that?
- You can't read?
I left my reading glasses at home.
Rascal! A love letter for the nurse?
She's like your sister.
Not only love letter.
He even wants you to kill your
husband and elope with him.
Damn you! I'll show you.
No sparing you.
I egged the nurse on.
He won't ever talk again.
- Where are they running to?
- Looks like a film shooting.
Come on, let's take a look.
The Writer.
Wonderful! After so long!
How have you been?
We're fine.
But what are you doing?
Is your story being
made into a film?
Why not? The producer liked my
story immensely. He signed me...
...for story, screenplay,
dialogues, direction...
...music, lyrics, everything.
- You must be the hero too?
- Are you ridiculing me?
- What's your story?
- It's like this...
Forgive me, this isn't my story.
It is your story.
It's the story of the hero
who gives his heart...
...his whole life for
the sake of his girl.
But I'm not getting to
the end of this story.
Will the girl ever
appreciate her real hero?
Will the hero succeed in helping
her marry the man she loves?
- Are you telling the truth?
- I saw it with my own eyes.
You'll see, my words are true.
- Mine are.
- Let's see.
- We need your help.
- Why, what happened?
Ranjit wants us to
marry in a church.
And she wants to go to a temple.
Why don't you decide?
Draw the lot.
I have a third option for you.
The graveyard.
- Please, listen to me...
- I told you not to get too close
She refuses to understand.
You take care of her.
That slap on your face is
the slap on my prestige...
...for you have borne an
irresponsible daughter.
She is trying to add
fuel to the fire...
...that was started 27 years ago.
None but my enemy's son
you fall in love with?
Enemy's son? Ranjit?
This family will accept
only a Christian son-in-law.
Else, I cannot imagine, how many
will lie dead on either side.
Ranjit, this is etched in stone.
Only a Hindu girl may
enter this family.
That's my final decision. Not
even God can change my decision.
Whatever the uncles might say,
I will make sure they're married
- What happened?
- Florence has run away from home
Overtake that bus.
Drag them out.
They're driving me crazy.
They aren't in that bus.
The marriage registrar's office...
They aren't inside.
The railway station, hurry.
Any news?
We've combed the entire area.
Couldn't find them anywhere.
If my daughter isn't
home by nightfall...
...no one will be left
alive in their family.
This is Holy War!
He has tainted my prestige.
If I am disgraced, I will
burn everything to ashes.
Stop, please. Stop.
What are you about to do?
It's all happening because of you.
Where are you hiding them? Tell me!
Speak!
Or I'll bury you alive right here.
Where are they?
Talk or you're dead.
Florence and Ranjit never went
anywhere. They're right here.
They will never marry unless
they have your blessings.
You wanted a Christian
son-in-law, no?
Congratulations.
He is a Christian.
But your daughter is
Christian no more.
And you wanted a Hindu bride
for your son, didn't you?
She is Hindu.
But your son is Hindu no more.
Now your son-in-law
and daughter-in-law follow...
...the creeds of your choosing.
But your son and daughter
do not follow your credo.
Now what?
What will you do?
Who is warring against whom?
Which religion is at war?
And how to start the fires?
Because someone or the other
must be taught a lesson.
We can't allow anyone else to win.
Impossible!
Victory to our religion!
Victory to me!
Isn't that the secret behind the
crusades, the holy wars, jihads?
Selfish ends.
Egos.
Power. Victory.
The two of you should join hands
You used the quarrel to prove...
...that you swear by
the same creed...
...you speak the same language.
Of hatred.
Whereas religion can
mean nothing but love.
Do not tear the lovers apart.
Enough of this attrition.
Enough of these killings.
Give life a chance.
Let them find happiness
for themselves.
For all you can set
apart are bodies.
Can anyone erase love from hearts?
No matter how much you plead...
...these crooked fellows
won't straighten out.
D'souza, give me your cross.
Give me your rosary.
From today, I'm Shivshanker.
And I'm Peter Pereira.
Jassi, when you were
born you didn't know...
...whether you were
Hindu or Christian.
I'm the one who told
you, you're Hindu.
Your father is Hindu,
your daughter is Hindu.
How can you be Christian?
behaved just like you...
...and we have suffered.
You mustn't suffer
like us all over again.
Give your consent to the marriage.
Your father is begging of you, son.
Give your consent.
"I have seen, I know"
"I know it, in my heart"
"In the victory of
two loving hearts..."
"I rejoice"
"If you got faith in your heart,
you got everything"
"If there's no faith,
you got nothing"
"Love... love... love...
go on sharing love"
Lucky, our roles are over.
Time to wipe off the make-up.
Return the dresses and find out
the timing of the bus back home.
In the meantime, I'll pack.
Can't even smile?
Actually, Raja isn't our son.
Yes Grandpa. Raja is a friend
of Florence and Ranjit.
He staged this melodrama
to help them get married.
Were it not for him...
...our families would never
have come together again.
- Will you come over here, please?
- I know what's on your mind.
Why don't we take
Raja for a grandson?
Let me announce this.
From this day...
...Raja is our grandson and
we are his grandparents!
Applause, please.
Chaddha, words don't
make a relative.
Then?
It will come to be once our
Tina is married to Raja.
First, you must ask Raja whether
he is willing to accept.
- I'll talk to Raja.
- Right, he's your friend.
- He will surely agree if you say.
- No Ghuman Uncle.
- I can't marry her.
- But why?
Raja, tell me.
For my sake.
Because I'm in love
with another girl.
You're in love with a girl
and I know nothing about it?
Raja, you turn out to
be quite a revelation.
Come on, quick.
Who's the lucky girl?
- Tell me. Raja, please...
- Florence, what use knowing?
I'll talk to Grandpa right away.
I'll see to it you marry her.
- That isn't possible.
- But why?
Because she's married.
Besides, she never loved me.
She was in love with someone else.
And now she's married to him.
She ditched you for someone else?
- Don't call her names.
- But what use pining for her?
Better, get married.
Start life anew.
Love just happens...
...without any consideration
for gains or betterment.
Love is so overwhelming
an emotion...
...it leaves space
for no one else.
- Is that your last word?
- No. It's my final decision.
Florence, I know my decision
is going to hurt you.
But I'm happy for myself.
Farewell.
