Ah...How wonderful it is!
Did you say something, Margarita?
That crown-wearing swan!
Isn't it wonderful?
Wait just a sec!
What are you doing, Hans?
It might be a bit big...
Oh well.
Thank you for waiting.
What's that?
Now, Princess Margarita...
please close your eyes.
Oh Hans...
Will this do?
Oh...!
Is it okay now?
What's wrong, Hans?
Errrr...sorry!
How rude!
I hate you Hans!
Oh my...could that be...
Prince Siegfried?
I still hate you!
Wait for me, Margarita!
Margarita!
That's payback for just now!
Ah...how elegant he is!
Totally unlike Hans...
Stop comparing me to the Prince, please!
Hey...
Speaking of that, when are you
going to be my wife?
How arrogant! Who would marry you?
Ahhh! He's here!
How wonderful...!
Be careful!!
Thank you Hans.
Again...Oh Hans, really!
Don't tell me...
It feels almost like a beautiful woman
looking at me.
Prince! Prince!
What is the matter?
Look at that!
How the...the swan is wearing a crown!
What a rare sight this is!
The swans are...
What are you doing, Adolf!
Observe as I take the rare swan out in one shot!
Don't do it!
Adolf!
Adolf has become stone!
Prince, this is a magical forest!
This must be the doing of that crown-wearing swan!
How could that be...?
Let us flee from here, Prince!
Nothing good will come from staying long
in this horrible place.
How mysterious...
No.
There is nothing mysterious about it at all,
my Prince.
That crown-bearing swan is a magician.
Now that I think of it, no one has plumbed
the depths of that lake.
But I find the notion that the precious swan
is a magician...
...to be totally unbelievable.
But my Prince, you were there when Adolf
he tried to shoot the swan.
As a result, he got turned to stone.
Therefore, I think it would be wise to avoid
the lake...
Your Highness...
Her Majesty the Empress seeks an audience.
How does my Esteemed Mother?
Siegfried.
At long last, tomorrow is the day you become a man.
Certainly.
Due to the early passing of your Father,
you will become this castle's master starting
tomorrow.
Yes.
In consideration of that fact, let us
choose for you a bride.
My bride?
Indeed
The ruler of a country is in need of a queen.
But...
Please do not worry
I have already invited the most beautiful
girls from our surrounding countries...
...to the ball tomorrow.
You may then choose from within their ranks
whosoever you most fancy to be your bride.
But mother...!
I am still...
No...
Because you are about to come of age...
it would be unseemly to remain in singlehood.
Or perhaps there is someone you already love?
No, that is not so.
In that case, is that satisfactory?
Yes.
Congratulations, Prince.
Benno, do not joke with me!
Even if it were for the sake of becoming
the king of this country,
I cannot marry someone I do not love!
What is there to congratulate me on?
However, I cannot go against my Mother's wishes.
That cannot be helped.
That is the fate you were born with, as a Prince.
I know that!
I know...but...
Benno!
Yes!
What is it?
I want to see that mysterious swan again.
What?
I don't know why, but I am fascinated by it.
But...that swan is a magic...
If that crown-bearing swan were really a magician,
I must see it again, to somehow plead for Adolf's life.
That cannot do, my Prince.
If something should happen to you...
No.
I cannot believe that the swan is a magician.
But...
Why is it...?
Why is there something like this here?
Hans! Hans!
What is it, Margarita?
Look, the crown-wearing swan is going home.
Adolf, wait for me.
It's Prince Siegfried.
It's there.
Look. The swan is departing.
Let us give chase!
The Prince is chasing after the crown-wearing swan.
Hans! Hurry up! What're you doing?
I have to go too?
Damn. It's a dead-end!
My Prince...let's just give up!
My Prince, this is impossible! We cannot
ride up this mountain!
How amazingly courageous is the Prince!
The Prince's companion seems to be
having difficulties.
Please wait for me, Prince!
Prince!
Margarita!
What is it, Hans?
Where are we going?
What an idiot! Isn't it obvious?
You don't have to call me an idiot!!
Margarita, it's dangerous...let's go back.
We can't do that.
Alright...!
Help me!
Margarita!
No, I can't...
- Margarita!
It's the end...goodbye, my Prince...
Really! She has no consideration for me at all...
The Prince, indeed!
Whoa...
Come, let's go!
Where on earth is that swan heading to?
Whoa!
What a place!
This is...
The crown-bearing swan...
has become a human!
This is an enchanted forest...
Let's go home, Margarita!
No...it's alright.
The Prince is here after all.
Prince Siegfried.
H-How did you know my name...?
Who on earth are you?
Why were you in the guise of a swan?
My name is Odette.
Odette...
Odette. Are you really a swan...
...or are you human?
I am a human.
But because of the wizard, I must
stay in the form of a swan.
Because of a wizard?
Yes.
And I can only return to my human form
during the night.
In that case, the one who turned my
companion to stone was...
It's the doing of Rothbart.
Rothbart?
Whilst you were at the lake, did you
not see a black owl?
Now that I think of it,
there was an owl with a distinctively
evil presence.
That was the Wizard Rothbart.
In the form of an owl.
In the form of an owl?
Please hurry and return home, Prince Siegfried.
Rothbart is sure to be watching.
In that case...this castle must be Rothbart's...
That's the wizard's lair...
Will the Prince be alright?
How dare he, that Rothbart!
Please wait a moment, Prince Siegfried.
Do not try to stop me.
I must save the petrified Adolf.
No.
Rothbart cannot be defeated by mere human strength.
How would we know without even trying?
When we tried to oppose Rothbart,
my country was obliterated.
Your country...?
Your country was obliterated?
I was the princess of another country.
Three years ago, Rothbart appeared at our country.
He wanted me to be his wife.
Both my father and I refused,
so starting with my father, he
destroyed the entire country.
And he brought me here.
But why did Rothbart give you the
form of a swan?
That is because he did not want other
men to see me.
Why is that?
If someone should appear that I loved
from the bottom of my heart,
Rothbart's power would disappear.
That is why whilst it is day I have the
form of a swan,
so that no one could fall in love with me.
Is that true?
Yes.
When I was first brought here, that was
what Rothbart told me
before turning me into a swan.
If that is true,
let my opponent be Rothbart.
You can't! If you say that, Rothbart will...
No.
When I first saw you today as a swan
at the lake,
my heart was captivated by you.
At that time, you...
It's those eyes!
The eyes of the swan back then.
Odette...
Odette!
Tomorrow, at my castle,
there is a ball to celebrate my coming of age.
Please attend, by all means.
I...I want to make you my queen.
No...no...
That cannot be...I can't!
Odette!
Please come to my castle.
There, I will swear my love to you.
From thence on, there will be nothing to fear!
Even though I would like to, as long
as Rothbart is here, I cannot.
Goodbye, Prince Siegfried!
Wait, Odette!
I beseech you to return home.
Rothbart is a fearsome man.
Tomorrow, you will come, won't you?
I will be waiting.
I have no intention of letting anyone
but you be my queen.
Please come.
Please return home.
Otherwise, I cannot make any promises.
I will go now, so please be sure to come.
You must come!
As the flames blazed up, I looked
intently into your eyes
You fixed your eyes on me.
Embarassed, my chest flutters.
Embarassed, my tears overflow.
This is the first time I have felt these emotions
To experience the day my love will return
I think that was the reason for my birth.
Father! Father!
Oh my, you're still obliviously sleeping?
Father, the sun has set already!
You are unusually tired today, aren't you?
That's probably because I turned the guy
who was trying to kill Odette to stone.
It's tiring, using magic in the daytime.
It's time to get up, eh.
You are quite infatuated with Odette, aren't you?
The night is my realm.
Tonight, I shall once again seek to marry Odette.
I might get lucky tonight...
Oh, my dearest Odette!
Please wait for me.
Father, is it okay for you to be so relaxed?
What?
Your dearest Odette saw a young man today.
What?
Why did you not tell me earlier?
What are you talking about?
You are the one who was bumbling around! Really!
So, this young man...
...what sort of man is he?
Are you concerned?
Of course I am!
But speaking of that, he's certainly something...
that Siegfried!
Siegfried?
He's that castle's prince.
Really?
Yes.
Anyway, he invited her to the ball where he
will choose his queen tomorrow evening.
"Will you come, or will you not?"
That Siegfried!
That is unforgivable!
For goodness' sake, father!
Where is he?
Where could he be?
That rascal Siegfried! Where are you?
Where are you hiding?
Are you so afraid of me that you have
concealed yourself?
You won't find him anywhere.
What did you say?
He's left long ago.
Then...what about Odette?
Let's see...she's probably dreaming of Siegfried,
her heart brimming with thoughts of him.
For her to be chosen by such a young and
wonderful prince,
even you would be pretty worried, eh?
Shut up!!
Ooh, scary...
Now that it has come to this, I will have
to be ruthless, even if it's Odette.
Odette, Odette...
My lovely Odette...
How do you do, Odette?
So who did you meet today?
Could it be Prince Siegfried from the castle?
H-How could you know...?
Did you think I wouldn't know something like that?
But of course, it would have been better
for me not to know.
Oh well, let's forget about that man.
How about it, Odette?
Isn't it about time you agreed to be my wife?
I've waited for three years. You should
know my feelings.
Won't you make me a happy man with your
answer tonight, eh?
Odette?
My dearest Odette!
If you become my wife,
you will have a life of extravagance!
I swear that I will give you luxury greater
than anything a queen could imagine.
Why will you not answer?
Do you not like talking to me?
As long as you do not answer,
you will continue to be a swan.
Is that alright with you?
I do not want a life of luxury,
nor do I wish for a magnificient lifestyle.
I only want...
Only...? What would you want?
I only want to be with the one I love.
The one you love?
It can't be. It can't be.
It can't be. Don't tell me...
Don't tell me that the one you love
is that Siegfried character?
Odette! I am truly in love with you!
Yet, you...yet, you...
Why! Why do you not love me?
Use your power to make me.
There is nothing you cannot do.
Aren't you the great Lord Rothbart?
Be quiet! Be quiet!
No matter how strong my magic is,
I cannot change the human heart.
If that were possible,
who would wait three years for you?
Odette, will you not have pity on me?
How long do you intend to make me wait?
Or is it really true that you love that Siegfried?
Yes.
Im-Impossible!
To love such a young boy you've only just met!
No.
For a long time already,
I've been in love with Prince Siegfried.
For a long time already?!
Yes. Prince Siegfried has always ridden
his horse by the lake.
So the reason you hate me,
is because of that?
D-Do not make me angry, Odette!
I could turn you into a disgusting creature!
Even a grub!
Or a caterpillar!
Behold!
But I did not do that.
I only gave you the form of a beautiful swan!
Do you know why?
Is that not also a sign of my love for you?
No.
If you really loved me,
you would not do all these things
against my wishes.
Now, Lord Rothbart.
If you really love me,
leave me immediately.
Please get out of this room now.
How dare you, how dare you say such a thing?!
Odette!
You wish to attend the Prince's ball?
Who would allow such a thing?
Who?
Who?
Tell me who would let you go?
I'm sorry, Canary.
How about that, Odette?
Now you are a caged bird.
At tomorrow's ball,
Siegfried will have to choose someone
other than you to be his bride,
and swear his unending love to!
Prince Siegfried!
Prince Siegfried!
I must not let myself be soft-hearted.
That damn Odette!
Damn her!
Damn her, damn her...damn her!
And here I was wondering what all that noise was,
and it was you doing this after all.
What is so funny, Odil?
You got rejected again, Father?
Shut up!
It's no use.
No matter how long you wait,
she will not become your wife.
Shut up! Shut up!
You detest Odette, don't you?
I hate her!
I hate her because she is breaking my heart!
Then why don't you kill her?
What?
It'll all be fine if you kill Odette.
You've been waiting all these years
and you still can't make her yours.
Anyone would have killed her by now.
What's wrong, Father?
No, I cannot do that.
I could never raise my hand to kill
that beautiful Odette.
How soft hearted you are!
If you won't kill her,
then I will help you do it.
No, Odil! Don't do it!
I truly love Odette.
I love her...
No, she will come.
She will.
But my Prince,
that wizard called Rothbart...
Say no more, Benno.
I have already decided in my heart
that with the exception of that girl,
I will choose no one else to be my queen.
But...if she should fail to turn up...
She'll come. Definitely.
I have faith in her.
I believe her.
Margarita!
Margarita, are you asleep already?
What is it, Hans?
Well...uh...
What is it?
Well...uh...
I was thinking about the Prince and
Princess Odette, and...
and...uh...
that got me thinking about you and I...
and uh...
Oh, Hans,
You've always been so flattering to me.
To tell the truth,
I have also been thinking about them
dancing in tomorrow's ball,
and how romantic it would be.
Margarita...
For goodness' sake, Hans, you
interrupted my dream!
Hans, what are you doing?
What was I...
What...uh...uh...
You're strange, Hans.
Goodnight, Hans.
Tsk, she doesn't know how I feel...
Goodnight, Margarita.
Margarita!
Margarita, good morning!
Good morning!
That Margarita...
Huh? Where did she go?
Perhaps she went to the lake?
Margarita!
Margarita!
Margarita!
Shush!
Look at that!
How cute was that?
What's wrong, Hans?
The swans are crowded together
and making a racket!
Really?
Something must have happened.
Hans, let's go take a look!
Princess Odette has not arrived.
That must be why they're making so much noise.
Did she get sick?
But she has been coming to this
lake for three years,
without ever missing a day.
If that's the case, could it be...
Could she have been locked up by
the wizard Rothbart?
Then she won't be able to go to the ball tonight!
If so, Prince Siegfried
will have no choice but to choose someone
else to be his queen!
What should we do, Margarita?
What to do...what to do...
What to do?
I got it!
I will go to Prince Siegfried right
away and tell him!
To the Prince?
Yes, because we don't have enough power
to save Princess Odette by ourselves.
That's true.
And Hans, you will go to the wizard's castle
and check what happened to Princess Odette.
Go to the wizard's castle?
I...Me...by myself?
Look, if you don't want to go,
that's alright.
In return, I will never be your wife. Hmph!
I got it, Margarita!
I'll go!
In that case, I'm counting on you!
Boy oh boy. It always ends up like this.
The ball is approaching...
I can't make it.
I just thought of a good idea!
How about we kill the prince?
Kill the prince?
If the prince were to perish,
Odette will have no choice but to love me.
You can't do that, father.
Even if the prince were to die,
his memory will remain in Odette's heart.
The Prince will continue to live
in Odette's heart.
That's true.
What should I do? What should I do?
There is one, and only one solution.
What? You have a solution?
Yes.
What is it?
Please tell me, Odil!
The Prince only has to love another woman.
But,
Siegfried will not even look at
anyone but Odette.
What should we do about that?
O-Odil?
Odette! Odette!
What are you doing, father?
Don't be mistaken!
You look so much like her,
you nearly fooled me!
How about it?
With this, Siegfried will
swear his love to me.
How fitting that you are my daughter!
Wonderful! What a wonderful idea!
With this, you only have to wear a
beautiful dress and go to the ball,
and even that Siegfried will become
silly with love.
I think I wouldn't mind
marrying Siegfried?
Will that be alright, father?
Of course! Of course!
If we do that, Siegfried's love will be yours.
That's right.
And Odette will also give up and
become yours.
I'm excited already.
Father! We will be very busy tonight.
Stop being all lovey dovey,
and go to sleep already!
That's right.
I must get some sleep.
Good night!!
What is it?
I'm pretty sure I saw something like a squirrel.
Was it my imagination?
A squirrel?
And yet,
how did you get to such a high place?
Are you lost?
What a cute squirrel.
That must be it. The words I utter
cannot be understood by the Prince.
This is going to be a problem.
If you understand what I am saying,
tell Odette that regarding tonight's ball,
she must,
she must definitely come.
Now. Return to the forest.
What's wrong?
She's late...
Even if she asked me to check
up on Odette's situation,
the drawbridge is up.
I only have to remove this chain.
Alright!
It's no use. It won't move!
Oh yeah!
What was that noise just now?
Whew, I'm safe.
Wow. It came off.
Huh? It got chewed through.
Must have been a damn rat.
Calling me a rat...
The sun will soon set.
And the ball is not far off.
I will also be going out,
to have a good look at who Siegfried
is going to choose.
I'm looking forward to it!
And I had spent so much effort
bringing it down...
Odette...
Prince Siegfried...
So, Odette. I'm going to the ball.
Tomorrow is our wedding ceremony.
Look forward to it, and wait for me patiently.
Hans.
Hans!
It's Margarita!
Margarita!
Hans!
Princess Odette is in this room, isn't she?
Yes. The problem is how do we open this door?
Why are you talking so nonchalantly about it?
The ball is about to begin!
Hans! What are you doing?
Hurry up, and
put weight on the other side!
Hans, are you alright?
The door is opening!
And now, the next is Princess Katerina.
Congratulations, Prince Siegfried.
Odette.
Next is Princess Rosanna.
Prince Siegfried,
I wish you happy birthday from the
bottom of my heart.
Hurry, Odette.
Odette.
How rude!
My name is Francine!
Now, Siegfried.
From the ranks of these Princesses,
you must choose the one you like,
and dance with her.
Mother.
I have no intention of marrying
any of these princesses.
Siegfried!
Everyone,
tonight's ball is hereby concluded.
To the princesses who have travelled so far,
I offer my sincerest apologies.
How can that...
Now, please...
Odette!
Princess Odette, are you alright?
Quickly, quickly!
I knew you would come, Odette.
I am Odil.
What did you say?
Odil?
Yes. I am Odil.
To call me Odette...
But last night, you said...
No.
I clearly told you I was Odil.
You must have heard me wrongly.
Is that so?
Well, what's in a name?
Odil, thank you for coming.
Who is that,
that Princess in black?
I don't know, but she is very beautiful.
Siegfried seems to know and like her.
I am relieved.
Now, maestro. Music!
Yes!
Music!
Wait! Hold it!
Stop right there.
How dare you come out here.
Well then, I'll show you something good.
Take a good look at that!
Mother,
and all who are gathered here tonight.
I have an announcement to make.
Today,
the day of my coming of age,
I wish to welcome Princess Odil to this her new home,
as my bride.
No! That can't be!
I understand.
If you Siegfried, love the Princess
wholeheartedly,
I will also agree to it.
Of course.
I swear, in front of everyone here,
to make Princess Odil my queen,
and love her for the rest of my life.
You!
Who are you?
Siegfried.
At last you have sworn
to love my daughter.
Y-Your daughter?
Don't tell me...you are Rothbart?
That is right.
With this, Odette is mine!
Odette!
Then you are...
I told you, my name is Odil.
It's a bit too late to be surprised now.
Because you have sworn to make
me your queen,
and to love me for the rest of your life.
Odette!
Please forgive me, Odette!
No matter how much you cry now,
Odette is mine.
Ohh, have you awoken, Odette?
Goodbye, Prince Siegfried!
Odette!
Wait, Odette!
Let's go home, Odette!
Odette!
You are mine now!
Well done, Odil!
Odette!!!!
Please wait, Siegfried!
Mother!
Your opponent is a wizard.
You don't know what sort of danger
you are putting yourself in.
Please forgive me, Mother.
I...
Even if I have to forfeit my life,
I must rescue Odette!
From today, you are the master of
this castle.
I will not allow you to engage in
reckless behaviour.
Mother...
Please forgive me.
S-Siegfried!
Siegfried!
Siegfried!!
It's alright, it's alright.
Cry as much as you want.
But you must give up some day.
Odette, I am waiting for you,
waiting for the day you will come
back to me and open your heart...
Prince Siegfried!
That damned youngster!
I will not tolerate this any more!
Let's get on with it, Rothbart!
Interesting. You are saying you
want to fight me?
I have come to save Odette!
Who do you think I am?
I happen to be the great wizard
Lord Rothbart!
Damn you!
No, Prince Siegfried!
Odette!
Please run away, Prince Siegfried!
At this rate, you will be killed!
Don't worry.
He won't kill Siegfried.
He will just drive him away.
Isn't that right, father?
Yes, I got it.
You have Siegfried's vow of love,
so I won't kill him.
He's your cute husband, isn't he?
Father, be careful.
Odette is headed your way.
What?
That damn Odette!
It's the Prince!
Where is she?
Where are you, Odette?
Odette!
Don't do it, Odette.
You know what will happen if you disobey me.
Hurry and run away, Prince Siegfried.
Odette!
You should be the one running away.
I have come here
for the sole purpose of
destroying Rothbart.
Siegfried, if you should take that
attitude with me,
even if you are Odil's husband,
I can't let you leave this place alive.
Prince Siegfried! Come in here!
How interesting.
Come at me, brat!
Hans, I beg you.
If you wish to marry me,
Go help the Prince!
Alright! I'll do it!
Go for it!
Now, Siegfried. Go home, go back
home before you get hurt.
A squirrel, eh!
You noisy creature!
Hans!
My Hans!
They're still going at it!
Now, now. It's useless, no matter
how much you try to run.
What a troublesome son-in-law!
Now, how about it, my son-in-law?
If you will return to your castle
and live with Odil,
I will spare your life.
Who the hell would want a wizard's
daughter?
What did you say?
Father, it doesn't matter anymore!
Kill Siegfried!
Kill him!
Right then! I'll kill him!
I'll kill him! Like so!
Prince Siegfried!
Prince Siegfried!
Odette, look at this!
Stop!
Don't kill Prince Siegfried!
Do you want to save him?
Please, let him go!
No, father.
Hurry and kill him!
Don't rush it, Odil.
If I wanted to kill him,
I could do so at any time.
In any case, Odette.
If you want to save this man,
say you will become my wife.
How about it, Odette?
Will you give me your heart,
will you swear your love to me?
You can't do it, Odette!
It doesn't matter what happens to me,
but you mustn't give Rothbart your heart!
Come Odette,
what should I do?
Is it alright to kill him?
Wait!
Don't do it, Odette!
Now...
will you swear to love me from
the bottom of your heart?
Or will I kill Siegfried?
Come now, say it!
Odette, I don't want my life!
Now, Odette!
I...
sincerely...Rothbart...
Stop it!!
Huh?
Yay! Hans has returned to normal!
He has returned!
Prince Siegfried?
Odette!
Prince Siegfried!
The power of their love
finally conquered the magic of Rothbart.
Hans, just as the Prince loves
Princess Odette,
will you love me?
Hans
The lake at dawn
Awakening from dreams
The dazzling spring
Is reflected
Ah, when the pair of you are loudly
Calling out to each other
The things of the forest will
shine brilliantly
The ripples glitter
Glitter and blaze
Even the truth rejoices
And continues the song
Always...always
The sunlight on the lake.
The ripples glitter
If they were glittering fairies
Continually telling of the truth.
Always...always...
The sunlight on the lake
