sine your pitty on the runny kine.
it was the year 2001.
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.
The big city was thriving,
but the inner city was dying.
Who was killing it?
This man. Dick lecter.
The head
of corporate america.
But the people had hope...
Because they knew that there was
one man who could fight the power.
One man who could stop
the madness.
One man who could beat
dick lecter like the l.A.P.D.
And that man-- That man
was pootie tang.
See that guy?
That's bad bitty.
The baddest drug dealer

pootie tang was born in a
small town outside of gary, indiana.
And that town
was called chicago.
As he grew,
Everyone noticed something different
about the way pootie would talk.
It baffled everyone--
Doctors, scientists.
Let me break it down
to you like this.
Pootie tang is, was
and will always be...
Too cool for words.
hi, pootie!
Pootie tang was the most popular kid in town.
We didn't always know
what he was saying,
But we always knew
what he meant.
Like i knew i was his best friend.
That's me. Trust me.
Yeah, he had
a special effect on people,
Especially on the ladies.
Not girls.
Grown-Ass women.
Hiya, pootie tang. I'm a tine cappy,
my damie. Wa-Da-Tah.
All right, pootie tang.
But for some of the ladies,
Pootie was just
too hot to handle.
Damn you, pootie tang!
I can't take
no more of this!
Who do you think you are,
treatin' me this way?
Oh, i've had it with you!
You hear me talkin' to you with your nappy head!
This is it!
I'm finished with you!
Get out of my life,
pootie tang!
You think i'm jokin'?
Take your shit!
Take your shit and get out,
pootie tang! I'm sick of you!
Pootie--
Pootie, don't go.
* Just because you bought her
a brand-New car *
* and you got to live
and eat in a mansion *
* like a movie star *
Pootie tang
was an only child.
His father, daddy tang,
worked hard to raise pootie right.
He had this belt.
He was so fast with that belt...
That before pootie could do wrong,
daddy tang would set him right.
Don't you grab them peas
without askin' your mama, boy.
May i dane on the cherries,
mama di?
Yes, you may, pootie tang.
Now, that's better.
You got to have respect
to get respect, pootie tang.
So, do you have any girlfriends at school, pootie?
Aw, mama di. There's a sine
tippi in a classi-Ti.
She's a cole toni.
Don't you talk dirty
to your mama, boy.
Always got your head
in them girls.
You need to have
your head in the books.
Leave the ladies alone.
and that's the way it was.
Daddy tang and his belt
was always there,
Teaching pootie the difference
between good and bad.
Now, when i say he was always there,
i mean he was always there.
Hey, pootie, let's
steal some apples.
When pootie was only six,
his mother died,
Leaving him
and his father alone.
- Pootie was very sad.
- I know, son.
But his father was a comfort to him.
Don't slurp your soup
in here, boy.
Two weeks later,
another terrible tragedy.
His father was fatally injured at the steel mill.
What the fu--
Gorilla!
Gorilla!
It was incredible.
Only the third time a man had been
mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill.
Gorilla! Oh!
On his deathbed,
daddy tang had pootie make a solemn promise.
Pootie,
I know
i brought you up tough,
But that's
'cause i love you.
It's tough
out there, pootie.
You got drugs,
crime, gorillas.
Yeah.
I ain't gonna
be here much longer,
So i'm gonna
give you this.
Pootie,
that's my belt.
As long as you got it
right on your side,
You could whoop anyone's ass with just that belt.
I know
you love the ladies,
And lord knows
the ladies love you.
Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.
those were daddy tang's last words:
"Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt."
But there was something
else about the ladies...
That daddy tang forgot
to tell little pootie.
- Pootie tang turned out just fine.
-  pootie tang!
Daddy tang
would have been proud.
Yeah, pootie had it all--
Hit records, movies,
Magazine covers,
fancy cars,
Famous friends, beautiful
custom-Made clothes...
And ladies, ladies, ladies.
Through it all, i was right there by his side.
That's me. Trucky.
And that's my man,
pootie tang.
Pootie tang.
Pootie tang!
Big-Time celebrity,
ass-Kickin' crime fighter...
And role model
to the children.
pootie tang has a
message for the children of america,
So you better
wapatah to the bammies 'cause:
Pootie says cigarettes and fast-Food
burgers are bad like netatai.
And don't drink malt liquor 'cause
you don't need to 'cause you're okay.
Sa da tay. Also, eat
all your vegetables...
And don't bang the dillies.
that's frank,
dick lecter's right-Hand man.
So what do we care?
We care because
he's making these.
People have been making p.S.A.'S for years.
Hasn't made a difference.
Eddie, uh, hit me
with those figures.
Uh, since the inception of
pootie tang's p.S.A. Campaign,
Sales of lecter burgers
are down 30 percent,
Lecter cigarettes
down 20 percent...
And lecter whiskey,
Almost out of business.
For the first time,
somebody's getting to these kids, and it's killing us.
It's killing us.
It's killing us.
Hello, mr. Lecter.
Frank, i have a job for you.
Yes, sir.
I tell you, man,
pootie tang is one bad brother, man.
that's j.B. And lacey.
We make up pootie's crew.
Pootie tang will draw you a picture
of how he's gonna kick your ass...
Then mail it to you
ten days in advance.
The picture
gets there, right?
You go,
"what the hell is this?"
Then pootie tang knocks on your door,
promptly kicks your ass,
And you still won't know
what happened to you.
You got that right.
He is a kick-Ass artiste. Yes.
Know what i'm sayin'?
He like the da vinci of ass-Kicking.
That sounds kind of good. Pootie tang,
the da vinci of ass-Kicking.
Aw, man, pootie tang
whoop your ass so bad...
That you could
write it off on your taxes.
That's right. You got right here,
ass-Whooping number one,
Ass-Whooping number two.
This right here, you can't write that off.
That's just gettin' beat up.
I like to also add that pootie
tang can kick some ass too, boy.
Oh, here come pootie tang now.
Hey! Pootie tang! All right!
We was just talkin' about you.
All right, pootie tang!
Pootie tang, hey, man,

Pootie tang?
What you want with pootie tang?
Um, i-I need

I'm a representative of lecter corp.
Do you know what that is?
Great.
Well, uh, dick lecter,
The c.E.O., Mind you,
of lecter corp., He likes you.
He likes you, pootie,
and he wants to make you a very rich, rich man.
I have a contract here
for pootie to endorse.
Tasty heavy
pork chunk cereal.
It's delicious.
It's a wonderful product. Kids love it.
And kids love you.
We just wanna put that together.
Nah, di.
That's a canapan
to the semachai.
I didn't even tell you
how much it pays, pootie.
Twenty million dollars to sign with us for just one year.
Oh, what do you say,
pootie?
I got to say the nay-No,
my brother. Wa-Da-Tah.
Wa-Da-Tah?
How do you say the nay-No to 20 million? Why?
Maybe pootie don't wanna sign
because he knows you're full of it.
Yeah. First of all,
he knows that cereal's full of sugar.
And number two,
that's not all that you guys sell.
You sell cigarettes, whiskey,
bad time burgers, switchblades.
And it also says right here that you will
no longer have pootie doing p.S.A.'S...
Telling the kids to eat
healthy and to be smart.
Well, sure, exclusivity
goes without saying.
I'm sure your ugly intentions go without saying.
Take a walk,
money man.

But there was one man
who was not laughing at all.
Pootie tang goes out there

He tells them

He steals from me.
And what do i do?
I say take my money. Here.
Take it. Fine. Huh?
And he says no.

That's ireenie,
dick lecter's main squeeze...
And the most dangerous

Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.
Well, what daddy tang forgot to tell

"I will wholeheartedly endorse all lecter corp.
Products...
"And will do my best to convince
the children of the world...
"That the above mentioned

And should be bought

No, no. You are part of the corporation,
just like us.
Thought you could stay
out of it, huh?
Welcome aboard,
pootie tang.
Are you looking
for something, my friend?
Are you?
I've got it all now.
Shocking news today as beloved
pootie tang has agreed to endorse...
Several controversial
products for lecter corp.,
The infamous
giant corporation.
Yo, fellas,
somethin' on the tv about pootie tang.
Even my kids, man, looked up to him.
You know what i mean?
They don't even look at dad
like they look at him.
But now since he crossed,
man, my little--
My little man came up to me the other day and was like,
"Man, how could he do
that bullshit, man?
" i'm lookin' at him like, "whoa."
Pootie tang has made my children cry.
I'll not support him anymore.
Lecter corp.
Effectively owns the name pootie tang,
His image and all copyrights
that go along with it.
Mr. Lecter!
Mr. Lecter!
Mr. Tang has agreed to do several
commercials endorsing our sneakers,
Food products and cigarettes, whiskey,
mace, switchblades, rat poison.
mr. Lecter,
can we have a statement--
* why you sell out,
pootie **
Pootie?
Oh, no!
You know, biggie shorty,
i got to say,
I always had a high opinion of pootie tang.
But the way things are going now,
not only has he sold out,
He's scraping
the bottom of the barrel.
Pootie tang was drugged
by that crazy-Ass ireenie.
- Haven't you been watchin' the movie?
- And that's what disturbs me.
He's out there telling kids not to go to school,
To eat fast food,
to do drugs.
This is not the pootie tang i thought
i knew and i used to admire.
- Pootie tang-- He would never tell kids like that.
- You're in denial.
He's out there doing dirt to his own reputation.
Look.
- You don't know pootie tang.
- I don't know pootie tang?
Believe me,
i know pootie tang,
And this is not the pootie tang i thought i knew.
You know what? I thought a man of
your stature would have better sense...
Than to fall
for no mess like that.
look,
this thing has all fallen apart.
The man used to be admired
by people of all walks of life.
And you know what?
If the world is gonna fall for this
mess about my pootie tang,
Then maybe the world
don't deserve pootie tang.
What do you think pootie tang
needs at this point in his life?
He just needs some
of my good lovin'...
And he will be all right.
- You watch.
- I hope you're right.
- I know i'm right.
- Yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, we'll see.
That's right.
Watch.
I will.
* You used to be a hero
* now you're just
a big, fat zero **
pootie tang was messed up.
Punk bitch.
Sellout.
look at him.
Damn, pootie! Get a job, you bum.
Get it together, man.
Pootie looked like who did it and ran.
Pootie turned to the only woman who could help him.
Biggie shorty.
* Biggie shorty
* biggie, baby *
Pootie!
Aw, pootie.
Poor pootie tang.
Tippi tai.
That's all right.
Mama's got you.
That's all right.
Biggie shorty's
gonna take care of you.
Don't you worry.
Gonna have sex
with you too, you know.
Finally.
Are you sure you
gotta go, pootie?
Yeah.
that's a damn shame.
You were the best piece
of man i ever had.
You know,
you could just stay here and live between my bosoms...
For the rest
of your life.
Pootie gotta flittie tai,
biggie shorty.
Man's gotta do, i suppose.
I guess as long as you gone they can't
make you do no more commercials.
But where you gonna go?
I tell you what.
I got a little farmhouse outside of greenville.
It was my mama's. It ain't much,
but nobody's livin' there.
You go out there,
find yourself, blah, blah, blah.
But then you come
back to me, okay?
That's a fine tine, baby.
Now, give me some of that bony ass
one more time before you hit the road.
Man, i hates prison.
Prison sucks.
I reckon
it's supposed to.
You got somethin'
for me?
Oh! Oh!
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.
Mm-Hmm.
Oh!
Oh, this some fine dirt.
This is some good dirt.
Oh!
You know i'm gonna hook you up.
Man, i hate
these bastards.
They make me shower
every day.
They never let me get dirty.
I need to be dirty. I'm dirty dee, damn it!
Dirty dee.
Huh?
You gonna be dirty
again soon. I promise.
It's that pootie tang.
It's that pootie tang.
He got to be stopped.
I'm the one that's got to stop him.
Pootie goddamn tang!
* You gonna, you gotta
you gonna, you gotta **
Thank you.
pootie! Pootie!
Pootie! Pootie!
pootie was headed to the farm.
I wanted to go with him.
I wanna go with you, brother.
'Cause everything that happened was all my fault.
Pootie, everything that happened, man,
it's all my fault.
I told that bitch all about him.
I told this bitch all these things about you, man.
She just used it against him.
And she just used it against you.
I was sorry. I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.
It was killing me.
It was killing me.
Only did it for the ass.
Only did it for her ass, you understand.
That deri-Teri was
all the dinie, huh?
I felt like he saved my life.
Pootie, man, i just feel like...
You saved my life.
And i messed his all up.
Now i messed yours all up.
I wanted him to forgive me.
Can you ever forgive me, man?
Aw, trucky.
You my main damie, man.
Ain't no bad tammie
between us.
I wondered if he meant it.
You mean it?
I'm a baino denny.
I wanted to go to the farm with him.
Can i go to the farm
with you, brother?
Wa-Da-Tah!
All right!
Me and pootie going to the farm!
Whoo! You know,
i'm lookin' forward to this farm life.
Enough of the city
for me. Whoo!
Yeah, this is just
what we need, pootie.
Live off the fat
of the land, work hard.
Farming, farming, farming.
I can't wait, man.
I cannot wait.
We're gonna milk that cow.
Ooh-Whoo!
Get all that milk.
Two percent fat free.
Skim milk. All that, man.
Chocolate milk.
I don't need
no television, cappuccino,
Partying all night long.
I'm want some blisters on my hands,
some sweat on my back.
That's what i want, pootie.
Shit!
Oh, man. My pants.
Oh, man! My damn pants.
All right.
Farming, farming, farming.
This is not the thing, man.
This ain't cool, man.
Dirty shoes,
dirty pants,
Dirty shirt,
musty, stinky.
It's hotter than
a camel's hump out here, man.
And mosquitos all over my shirt.
I can't do it, man.
whose dog is
this dog following me around?
Whose dog is that?
You don't know who dog that is.
That could be anybody's dog.
It's too hot.
You know you're hot.
* Rip
* sho' you right

* shing-A-Ling shing
shing-A-Ling shong *
* shing-A-Ling shing
shing-A-Ling shong *
* shing-A-Ling shing
shing-A-Ling shong **
i didn't wanna leave pootie,
but i wasn't trying to hear all that survival shit.
Outback, my ass.
I need conveniences, man.
On the other hand,
pootie was lovin' every minute of it.
He was rejuvenated.
You hear that? Rejuvenated.
He was "juvenated" before,
lost it...
And got "juvenated" again.
* That lasts
* all night long
* home of the omino
* home of the domino
* home of the two-Piece
and the pepper *
And when pootie planted
his first cornstalk,
- Damie.
- He was happy.
Too damn happy, if you ask me.
It was just corn.
* I'm a southern girl
* southern girl
* country-Fied but that was just what he needed...
To take his mind
off his troubles.
Rown on the crowny town.
* You so country, yo *
Mornin'.
Hi, daddy.
Not now, stacy, honey.
Listen. There's a new fella here in town.
He's coming in here in a minute.
So?
So? So maybe you can
marry him, that's what so.
Aw, daddy!
Oh, come on.
Cut that shit out, stacy.
Here he comes.
Yeah. Hey there.
You got your can
filled all right?
Oh. This here
is, uh, my daughter.
Stacy.
Dillie on,
My damie.
Oh!
And she's a looker,
ain't she? Huh?
* Oh, ah, ooh, baby *
Ah, dirty dee.
God, you stink.
Thank you.
I wanna talk to you
about pootie tang.
You mean public enemy number one in my world.
Huh? Right?
We learned that anything
can be addictive.
We took our burgers and
pumped them so full of m.S.D...
That people can't even
taste real food anymore.
Today american kids don't eat
'cause they're hungry.
They eat 'cause they just gotta
have another lecter burger.
You see,
i own pootie's name.
He's mine.
I don't need him to sell my products anymore...
Because i've got thousands of them all over the country.
I'm just gonna give them the
clothes and this training tape.
And remember, when making
a public appearance,
Pootie tang always
struts like this.
Next week we're opening a brand-New
nationwide chain of burger stands.
Pootie's
bad time burgers.
As a matter of fact,
the only thing that could mess up our little party...
Is if the real pootie
showed up.
But that ain't
good enough.
I want him dead.
yeah.
I'd like to put that bitch in the ground myself,
but i ain't magical.
I been tryin' to get
that pootie for years.
He done jailed or offed all my boys.
All i got left is froggy.
Nobody know
where pootie's at.
I know where he's at.
I got people
everywhere, baby.
Nobody can hide
from corporate america.
And as far
as how to beat him,
Maybe this will help.
hello?
Hello?  uh-Oh.
Look at this.
Remember her? That's stacy,
the sheriff's daughter.
He's been trying to get her ass
married since she was 12 years old.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello?
Hello?
Why, um--
I-I'm sorry. I, uh--
Well, i-I made you
a pie... cake. Um--
D-D-Do you want
the pie?
Ohh.
I-I-I know
i'm not pretty or--
Or sexy.
Y-Y-You--
You probably like a...
sexy girl, right?
Baby,
I'm gonna sine your pitty
on the runny kine.
Now, see, that's what makes
pootie tang a real hero.
He can't stand by and see
a woman not lovin' herself.
He's gonna put
the love in her.
Now, me, i say just
give her a compliment.
Hey, i like your shoes.
Have you been workin' out?
Girl, what you doin'
with your hair?
But i tell you what,
I'm only gonna buy this hero shit but so many times.
back in the big city,
all hell was breaking loose.
I'm talking about
drug dealin', drug usin',
Booty shakin',
too much damn tv,
Drinkin', people eating too much,
gettin' all fat and sloppy,
Fightin', kids out of school,
ain't nobody readin',
People actin'
a straight damn fool.
And corporate america
was just loving it.
Look at them.
It's a party now.
Since he left, it just changed.
Everything just went bonkers.
Everybody lost their mind
and what not.
Pootie tang,
you shouldn't do this.
You should come back to the city,
where you belong.
back on the farm,
the worst happened.
Pootie tang's cornstalk died.
And for the third time
in his life,
Pootie lost the only thing
that was important to him.
First his family, then his belt,
and now his corn died.
Farm life was
driving pootie crazy.
He must have lost his damn mind.
Look at him.
Down on his knees,
crying over a piece of corn.
Not even popcorn.
Regular damn corn.
Pootie tang had lost all hope,
And it was gonna take
a miracle to bring him back.
pootie.
Pootie tang!
Up here, pootie.
Hey, watch the leaves.
Daddy?
You damn right i'm your daddy.
Pootie, what you doin' runnin' away from your problems?
- Did i teach you like that?
-
Hey, don't you
mumble, boy!
pootie, my boy.
Mama di.
Pootie, you're a good man.
I'm proud of you.
You have so much love in you,
and you can give it like a gift.
Your father was wrong to tell
you to guard it like a secret.
- W-W-What was that?
- Shut your mouth!
- Woman!
- You corn-Ass fool!
Pootie, teach the world
right from wrong,
But love the world
at the same time.
That's the key.
Where's your belt, boy?
You let some girl
get your belt.
You let the ladies
get your belt.
I knew that would happen.
Now you done lost all your confidence.
I'll tell you something, pootie,
ain't nothing special about that belt.
I bought it at piggly wiggly for 95 cents.
You don't never need
that belt, boy,
'Cause you got
the goodness in your heart.
Now you need to go out there
and take that and kick some ass.
hey,
don't you mumble, boy!
Now, go out there,
take that goodness...
And teach the world
right from wrong.
Now git!
I, uh--
I think maybe you and me
got something to talk about.
I, uh--
I understand you and stacy there...
Got to know
each other, huh?
Had yourself
a little time there, eh?
Huh? Huh?
Yeah.
Oh, that's terrific!
Well, partner,
When's the wedding, huh?
Huh?
Like i say, i sure would
be mighty proud...
To have you
for a son-In-Law.

Then i finally remembered

Anyway, i got there
