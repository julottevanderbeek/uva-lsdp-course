So here's what you missed
on ...
The stage always adds
at least ten pounds.
Glee.
The Secret Society
of Superheroes Club
is now in session.
It is the purpose of this club
to fight injustice,
to right
all that which is wrong,
and to preserve truth,
justice and peace
in the halls of McKinley High.
First order of business...
roll call.
Go.
Asian Persuasion here.
My superpower is being
the mistress of manipulation.
:
Blond Chameleon here.
My superpower is
I can impersonate anybody.
George W. Bush, heh.
Tarantula Head here.
My superpower is lashing you
with my dreads.
Sweet 'n' Spicy, here.
My superpower is money.
Second order of business...
inducting new members
into our ever-swelling ranks.
Candidates, come forth.
Excited to be here, Blaine.
First of all, there are no
civilian identities
in here, okay?
I am Nightbird
the Nocturnal Avenger.
And second of all, I really
hope you're not trying
to pass yourself off
as a certain telepathic leader
of a certain group
of superhuman mutants
because that would be
a copyright violation.
Uh, I'm Dr. Y
and my superpower is wheelies?
Welcome, Dr. Y.
Next.
I'm Queen Bee
and I can sting like a bitch.
Welcome, Queen Bee.
Next.
I'm the Human Brain.
Welcome, Human Brain.
What's this?
A text just came through
on my NightPhone.
"Have you talked to Kurt?"
I already told you,
Asian Persuasion,
this account is only supposed
to be for emergencies,
and you cannot use
your powers of manipulation
to coax me into getting
back with my ex, so stop trying.
What is it, Chai Tea?
Emergency in the choir room.
To the choir room.
Someone took
your Nationals trophy
and left that laptop
in its place.
ARTIE:
Who leaves a laptop?
Someone rich,
someone who wanted
to send us a message.
I got this.
:
Greetings, New Directions!
You have been living as national
champions on borrowed time,
and that ends now.
We have your trophy.
Soon we'll have your title
as well.
The great reckoning is at hand...
Sectionals.
Your move.
So, are you jumping
on this superhero bandwagon?
A club where you have
to wear full-body spandex?
Not really my thing.
Good, that means you'll be free
to hang out Friday night...
you and me.
What do you say?
Um... I...
RYDER:
Marley's got
plans on Friday, dude.
The football team's
got an away game
at Lawrence, and I asked her
if she'd come cheer us on.
See, Jake, it's funny.
Girls don't like it
when you make it seem
like you're really into them
and then totally blow them off.
You know what, dude?
I don't remember asking
for your opinion.
Guys, don't do this.
Whoa.
Whoa, you're
really intimidating.
Let me ask you
a question... what kind
of a name is Ryder Lynn
anyway? 'Cause it sounds
like your parents named you
after a cowgirl doll
who comes with her own pony.
Look, man, I don't
want any trouble.
I know you're a badass.
You want to know how I know
you're such a badass? Because
you ride a Razor scooter.
Nothing says "I'm a badass"
like a Razor scooter.
Guys, please, don't do this.
It... this is...
this is stupid. Stop.
Hey, hey, cut it out.
Stop. Come on, stop, stop it.
Stop. Cut it out.
Come on.
I persuade you
to stop fighting immediately.
Freeze, bitches.
FINN:
Thanks, Becky,
both you guys.
Glee Club, 20 minutes.
Okay, guys, sit down. We got
a lot of work to do today.
No, seriously, come on,
I mean it, sit down.
Okay, so the first
order of business today
is to welcome the newest members
to the glee club...
Ryder and Kitty.
Wait, don't we all get
to vote on her or something?
Well, Tina,
Kitty was fantastic in
In spite of my god-awful part.
Besides, we're under the gun.
We... we have to go
to Sectionals next week
and we need 12 members
to compete.
Oh, well, then,
just call Santana back
from Kentucky again
'cause apparently she's better
than anyone who's actually
enrolled here.
Look, Tina, not now.
Uh, look, where was I?
Sectionals, yes.
Here's the game plan.
Broke the marker.
Where does Mr. Shue keep
the other markers?
Uh...
Screw it. Uh...
The theme is "Foreigner."
We're gonna sing songs by
Foreigner in foreign languages,
wearing all the costumes
of the world's nations.
Wait, seriously,
that's your idea?
Yeah.
Kiki, what do you think?
FEMALE VOICE: I think I'm
alive and you're the machine.
BLAINE:
Finn, times have changed.
We're national champions
now, which means
we have to exceed all
expectations, so if that's
your best idea, I... I don't
think we stand a chance.
Wait, where are you going?
I'm going to get our trophy back
from the Warblers...
the one you haven't even noticed
is missing.
Crap, uh...
I'm the Beiste Master.
Blaine said
I couldn't be faculty advisor
unless I dressed up once a week,
so I'm from
the planet Testostergen,
I can digest any
known substance
and cry at the drop of a hat,
and, hey, I'm not kidding
about that last part.
Last night I teared up
at an Activia commercial.
This is just all so ridiculous.
Oh, come on, pumpkin,
this is fun.
Yeah, it's no wonder
superheroes
are all the rage.
Putting on a mask
is like getting up onstage.
It gives you the freedom to be
the person
you secretly aspire to be,
and if you ask me, the world
could use a few more heroes.
So, what's bugging you, kiddo?
You seem blue.
It was my first lesson
in Glee Club today,
and it was a total disaster.
What happened?
I don't know.
I mean, the lesson
that I planned
was awesome.
I... I think
it's just that the...
the glee club doesn't see me
as an adult.
God, is that
what coffee tastes like?
How do people drink that?
I'm just spitballing here,
but maybe you should invest
in a pair of tights.
You know, Clark Kent
was an awesome guy,
but it was Superman
who inspired everyone.
Be their hero, Finn.
I'm just saying.
Sebastian.
Of course it was you.
No, it wasn't, I swear.
I turned over a new leaf,
remember?
No more bullying, blackmail
or assault this year.
That must be boring for you.
Yeah, it is;
Being nice sucks.
He's waiting for you
in the library.
Who is?
The guy you're here to see.
Captain of the Warblers.
I thought you were captain
of the Warblers.
I knew they'd send you.
Allow me to answer
the obvious questions.
I'm Hunter Clarington, I am
the new captain of the Warblers,
and I'm not even
remotely bi-curious.
How are you captain
of the Warblers when...?
When you've never
seen me before?
Simple.
Dalton just gave me
a full scholarship
to move here
from Colorado Springs,
where I led
my military academy choir
to a Regionals victory
with presidential honors.
Now I'm here to kick it up a
notch, and that starts with you.
That's very intimidating.
Where's the trophy, Hunter?
Don't worry, it's safe.
It was just bait after all.
See, you're kind of
a legend here.
I like that.
So here's my offer:
Your little diversity club
can have its
Nationals trophy back
when you rejoin the Warblers.
And why would
I ever leave McKinley?
Why would you stay?
I heard you only went there
to be with Kurt,
right?
In fact,
I hear they even call you
Blaine Warbler.
They know you don't
belong there,
so why don't you?
SEBASTIAN: We all know
the real Blaine, Blaine...
ambitious, driven.
You're a Dalton boy.
Present the blazer.
That's not going to work on me.
Then why be afraid
to try it on?
Here's the thing, Blaine.
You know that Nationals
trophy was a fluke,
just like you know we're
going to win at Sectionals.
Now, I don't want to see
a Dalton legend like you
sidelined in his senior year.
I want you on the winning side,
here with us.
You know what goes great
with a new Dalton blazer?
An impromptu song.
What? No, no. Oh, come on, one
song for your old buddies.
Guys, I didn't come here
to sing a song.
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
There's a place
That I know
It's not pretty there
And few have ever gone
And if I show it to you now
Will it make you run away
Or will you stay?
Even if it hurts
Even if I try
to push you out
Will you return
And remind me
who I really am?
Please remind me
who I really am
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me?
Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it,
you know that we're worth it
Will you love me?  Will you love,
will you love, will you love?
Even with my dark side?
Don't run away,
don't run away
Just promise me you will stay
Promise me you will stay
Will you love me
With my dark side?
Oh, whoa
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me?
Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it,
you know that we're worth it
Will you love me?  Will you love,
will you love, will you love?
Even with my dark side?  Will you
love, will you love, will you love?
Don't run away
Don't run away.
SEBASTIAN:
What'd I tell you?
Flawless.
Keep it.
It's already yours.
Don't you think it's time you
came back where you belong...
Blaine Warbler?
Okay.
Oh, dear God.
So, I-I get it...
my first idea was pretty bad.
Worse than funk. Worse
than "Night of Neglect."
So... I decided to try
something new... "Dynamic..."
Duets."
This is gonna be
a lot more fun,
and it focuses on something
you guys actually like:
Superheroes. MARLEY:
Oh, so wait...
are we all gonna
have to wear costumes?
ARTIE: And who exactly
are you supposed to be?
The Bulge, who makes
gym socks disappear?
BRITTANY: Please don't melt us
with your bulge.
Well, I am...
the almighty Treble Clef,
Uniter of Glee Clubs.
KITTY: Jesus is the only
real almighty superhero.
Amen.
Nobody asked you.
Come on, guys,
let's hear him out.
Thanks.
Look at the Avengers.
Individually, they all have
amazing powers, but...
as a team,
they cannot be stopped.
Right now, we're a
bunch of individuals
with great powers and talents,
but... we're not a team.
Some of you even have
mortal enemies
in this very room,
allowing the Dark Side
to turn us against
each other, when we
should be focused
on the Warblers.
Nightbird is handling
the missing trophy.
Great. Thank you, Nightbird.
Jake will pair up with Ryder,
Marley will join Kitty
to perform the duets.
The rest of you,
start preparing to fight
an epic battle against the
forces of evil at Sectionals.
That idea was slightly better.
Still could be horrible.
Here's the only thing you need to study.
Isn't part
of the assignment that we
have to pick a song together?
The assignment is
"Dynamic Duets."
I took the liberty of choosing
a song to show off
my vocal bombasity while
at the same time highlighting
your mousy softness.
Well, can we at least talk about
which superheroes
we're gonna be?
You can talk all you want,
but I already decided.
I'm Femme Fatale... 'cause in
French, that means: "Kill Women."
No, it doesn't.
Which is what
I'm going to do
when we perform.
Okay.
Let's be honest,
I don't like you,
you don't like me,
and dressing up
in a cape and tights...
not gonna change that.
Fine. Don't do it, and get
booted out of Glee Club.
Mega Stud won't complain.
Hold-hold on.
Did you seriously
just call yourself "Mega Stud"?
It's my alter ego. So your
superhero choice is to be me?
There can be only one.
I am  I am
I am Superman
And I know what's happening
I am  I am
I am Superman
And I can
Do anything
You don't
Really love that guy
You make it with,
now, do you?
I know you don't love
That guy, 'cause
I can see right through you
I am
I am
I am Superman
And I know
What's happening
I am  I am
I am Superman
And I can do anything
Isn't MS a degenerative
nerve disease?
I thought it was
a girl's magazine.
If you
Go a million miles away
I'll track you down, girl
Trust me when I say
I know the pathway
To your heart...
FINN: Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing! Hey!
Stop it!
Finn, do something!
FINN:
Uh... Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, what's wrong
with you guys?
SAM:
Full nelson, full nelson.
You're not too
tough now, are you?
My goal was
to bring you two together,
not to have you dress up and...
karate-chop each other
in the face!
It was a lame exercise.
No, you know what's lame?
Not winning at Sectionals.
And if we don't get our act
together, we're gonna lose,
and then that's gonna be it.
I need you two to get along.
I heard you, Finn,
but I don't like this guy.
He's working his way through
every girl at this school,
and I think Marley deserves better.
You have
no idea what Marley wants,
or deserves. FINN: Enough!
Okay? Enough.
Clearly, you did not
take anything
from my last assignment,
so I'm gonna give you a new one.
Will it also be lame?
Ignoring you. It's
a "Kryptonite Lesson."
You two think
you hate each other.
I think you don't
understand each other.
So I want you to sit
in a room and tell each other
your deepest fears.
Only by
admitting your weaknesses
can you realize your strengths.
You sound like Yoda, dude.
Deal do we have?
Hey. You got a minute?
Yeah.
Dude, I was just gonna text you.
How is Operation:
Rescue/Recovery going?
Well, when
I went back to Dalton,
all those blazers
and singing with
the Warblers again...
Wait, wait, what, you
sang with the Warblers?
It just sort of happened.
But they embraced me
like I was a long-lost brother.
It was like
in
when Pyro left the X-Men
to join Magneto's Brotherhood.
It-it just felt right,
like maybe...
...I belong with the Warblers.
Dude,
no, no, you belong
here, with us, okay?
Does this have to do with Kurt?
Everything in this room
reminds me of him.
We were...
a dynamic duo in here.
Kurt was my anchor, Finn,
and now that he's
gone, I just...
I feel like I'm floating.
And you, you need a team
that's gonna gel.
Yes. Absolutely.
We need a team
with a lot of gel.
And... you're, like,
the biggest part of that.
I'm sorry, Finn, but the
Warblers are my birthright...
and my destiny.
I can't do a duet with you.
Because my singing voice
is crystal-clear
and you sort of sound like
you've got a snot bubble stuck
in the back of your throat?
What? No.
I don't think that... that's just
what everyone's saying.
Look... the reason
I can't do the duet
is because of the costume.
I can't wear a
head-to-toe body suit
made out of clingy fabric.
I'm too self-conscious.
I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want you
to answer me honestly.
Are you still driving
the bus to Puketown?
What?
You know.
Are you still giving yourself
self-inflicted
barf-wounds to the uvula?
I've done it
every day this week.
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.
I think that's why I was so
mean to you when we first met.
I've had body-image issues,
too, but my good friends,
the finger sisters,
Pointy and Birdie,
helped me keep the trim figure
I retain to this day.
Sweetie...
you have to trust me
on this... we'll try on
our costumes, and I swear,
if you look fat
even a little bit,
I'll be honest,
and we'll cancel
the performance, okay?
Okay.
Promise?
Promise.
When Gotham is ashes, then
you have my permission to die.
Good to know, Bane.
Is that a jockstrap?
Let the games begin!
What's this? What Finn
wanted us to talk about.
My Kryptonite.
Don't just hand me some
lame note... be a man,
tell me face-to-face.
My whole life,
I've never felt like I fit in.
Not anywhere.
Why?
I'm half white,
half black, half Jewish.
And just in case
I forget...
someone always reminds me.
Brah, I got
a really good black joke,
and since you're half black,
you can half listen.
Hey! Baruch Obamastein!
What are you exactly?
You a Oreo,
or a lightly toasted cracker?
Shalom!
So, what's  Kryptonite?
You know what, forget it.
This whole thing was stupid.
JAKE:
Dude, you just told me to be
a man, so are you
gonna be a man,
or are you just
gonna walk away?
I made you tell me
what your note said,
'cause I couldn't read it.
Meow. Well, I don't know
about you, but this kitty cat's
feeling so much yummier
now that she's
slipped into her tightest outfit
as Femme Fatale.
I'm waiting.
MARLEY:
I can't. I look ridiculous.
I'm sure that's not true.
Come on, I won't judge.
Uncross your arms.
I don't get it. What's WF? It's
supposed to be Wallflower.
Wallflower?
Your alter ego's
supposed to reflect how you
feel about yourself, right?
When I looked in the mirror,
this is what I saw.
Well, get over here,
so Femme Fatale
can tell you what  sees.
Stand up straight.
Shoulders back.
You look H-O-T-T, hot.
I do?
Now,
your clothes...
your mom made this, right,
like she does
most of your stuff?
Uh-huh. Well, bless her clogged,
overworked heart, but from now
on, I'm buying your clothes,
and they're gonna show off
your bitchin' bod.
But first things first.
Marley Rose, you are
Wallflower no more.
You are Woman Fierce,
and we are going
to kill this song.
Where have all
the good men gone?
And where are all the gods?
Where's
the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight
Upon a fiery steed?
Late at night
I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night
He's got to be strong
and he's got to be fast
And he's got to be fresh
from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
till the morning light
He's got to be sure
and it's got to be soon
And he's got to be
larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night
Up where the mountains
meet the heavens above
Up where the lightning
splits the sea
I can feel his approach
like a fire in my blood
Oh, I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night
He's got to be strong
and he's got to be fast
And he's got to be
fresh from the fight
I need a hero.
FINN:
That was incredible.
You worked so well together.
Teamwork! Yeah!
You guys, I don't smell
raspberry hair gel.
Does anybody know
where Blaine Warbler is?
Uh, well, as some of
you guys might know,
uh, recently, Blaine has been
going through a bit
of a rough time...
Oh, boo-hoo. Get over it.
It's like a bad Lifetime movie.
...and he's decided to finish
the rest of his senior year
at Dalton Academy.
He's been taken
by the Dark Side.
Finn?
There's something
I need to tell you about Ryder.
What's going on here?
I'm Mrs. Penkala.
I'm the district
special education director.
And Finn brought you here
so I can help you, Ryder.
I don't need any help.
I've made it this far on my own.
Jake should've
kept his mouth shut.
Dude, just-just
relax, okay?
Don't you want to figure
out why you keep studying
but you don't do any better?
Just have a seat.
Well, I read your file.
And you'd be surprised
how often
bright kids like you
who are struggling don't have
any testing done.
Even with conscientious parents.
Don't be nervous.
The great thing
about this test is
there are no right
or wrong answers.
I want you to say the numbers
in numerical order
and the letters
in alphabetical order.
Nine, one, T.
Seven, two, F, K.
Father.
Minute.
Pretty.
School.
Then.
Flowers.
I don't know what that says.
Try sounding it out.
I can't.
Fly.
I-I can't read that.
Uh, brown.
Is that even a word?
Time's up.
I don't know why this
stuff is so hard for me.
Am I stupid?
No.
You're actually very smart.
It's not a brain tumor, is it?
No.
Uh, I'm dyslexic.
You know, do you
know what it's like
to have a real secret identity?
Not like Clark Kent
or Peter Parker,
but to know inside you're not
who everyone thinks you are.
My whole life, it's been, "Ryder
just needs to apply himself."
"Ryder's smart; he just
needs to work harder,
focus, get it
together, man up."
But inside, man, I knew
they were all wrong.
It didn't matter
how hard I focused
or how hard I worked;
I was stupid.
And if anyone ever found that
out, if they knew the real me...
I was... I was sure it
would've killed my parents.
Man, and my dad's
a freaking PhD.
How is he gonna feel about
having an idiot for a son?
I'm sure your dad
loves you no matter what.
Dude, you learn to
read when you're six.
When you're six;
That's first grade.
Then they separate you
into these levels.
They don't tell you
that's what they're doing,
but everyone knows
who's in the smart group
and who's in the dumb one.
You think a
six-year-old knows
his dad's gonna love
him no matter what?
I've been carrying...
I've been carrying
this secret around
my whole life, man,
all this time.
Now you can put it down.
Okay?
'Cause the only secret
is that your brain works
a little differently than
everyone else's, that's it.
Okay?
They're gonna start
an individualized
education program for me.
I'll start working
with a special teacher
every day next week.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you for helping me, Finn.
I owe you.
Actually, you owe Jake.
Hey, Mrs. Rose.
Hey.
There is something
different about you.
Is that a new hairnet?
:
No, it's the same one.
You know, tell you the truth,
I did lose a little weight.
Six pounds this month.
Well, I knew it was something.
You look great.
Thanks, Jake.
Oh.
Marley would kill me
for telling you this,
but she talks about
you all the time.
You know, I had my chance...
and I blew it.
Well, it's never too late
to change. Look at me.
BOBBY:
Hey, Dump Truck,
get back to work.
What did you say to her?
I believe he called her
a broken-down,
ten-ton crap-filled dump truck.
Oh, and your new name
is officially Kosher Cappuccino.
You make this so easy when
there's only two of you.
Why don't you count
again, sweetheart.
It's payback time.
RYDER:
Hey!
Jake's my boy.
From now on, you mess with him,
you mess with me.
And me.
And me.
And me, too.
Whatever.
Better stuff to do anyway.
What'd you do that for?
You had my back.
Now I've got yours.
Excuse me. Uh, which superhero
are you supposed to be?
Kidding me? I'm the Puckerman!
Can we take photo, please?
That'll be ten bucks.
For 20, I'll clean your pool,
and if you give me 100,
I'll give you
the greatest night of your life.
suckers.
All right.
What's up,
half bro with the afro?
Hey, man.
Uh, where are you?
It sounds really loud.
I'm just making some scratch
out on Hollywood Boulevard,
aka the enormous skid mark
Los Angeles found in its undies.
What's going on?
I need some brotherly advice.
I'm all ears.
Okay, what are you
supposed to do when you really
like a girl, but you didn't
know it at first,
then you sort of blew
your shot with her,
and now this other dude's
really into her
who you used to think
was a total poser,
but turns out he's actually
a really cool guy
who totally has your back,
and you know you'll be
a world-class D-bag if you jump
in now and try to break them up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back it up.
Question: is she hot?
Yeah.
Uh, dude, you could say that.
Got it.
All right, well, listen up.
Play it cool.
Unlike the rest
of those Lima losers,
you have superior
Puckerman testosterone
that's pumping those hallways
full of premium.
Puckerman-brand pheromones.
Just let her catch a whiff.
Then you can sit back
and play nice.
And in a couple weeks,
I guarantee she'll be
begging for it.
You really think
that's gonna work?
Trust me. That's how
I bagged Teri Hatcher.
Let me tell you,
she's not complaining.
Listen, man, I got to go.
Homeless guy just threw up
on Barbra Streisand's star.
I got to snap a pic.
But remember my advice:
Don't be a dick...
But don't give up.
Thanks, bro.
Dude, this is part of
some master plan, right?
You're going back to the
Warblers to gather intel for us
so we can kick their ass
at Sectionals.
Sam, don't.
I feel awful enough as it is.
Stop, okay?
You've been beating yourself up
for, like, weeks
since you and Kurt broke up.
But going back to Dalton?
You told Finn it was 'cause
you feel more at home there.
If you ask me, it's just
another way to punish yourself.
And for what?
What did you do, exactly?
You okay?
No.
Is it because I don't look at
all like my profile picture?
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.
It was a guy that
friended me on Facebook.
I went over to his place
because it felt like Kurt
was moving on with his life
and I wasn't a part of it.
And I got to
thinking that maybe
Kurt and I weren't
meant for each other.
That we weren't
supposed to spend
the rest of our lives together.
But the horrible thing is,
right after I did it...
...I knew that we were.
Dude, you got to
tell Kurt that.
What, you think I
haven't told him that?
You think I haven't tried?
Calm down. It's okay.
No, it's not okay, Sam,
'cause I cheated
on the one person
that I love more than
anything in this world.
I hurt him, so of course
he's not gonna trust me.
He's never gonna forgive me.
Even if he doesn't,
you got to forgive yourself.
You got to stop...
What's-what's the word when
you make someone into a villain?
Uh...
Villainize?
Yeah, you got to stop
villainizing yourself.
Yeah, you hurt Kurt;
That wasn't cool.
So you're trying
to make it right.
But exiling yourself to Dalton
won't fix anything.
I just want to
stop feeling like
I'm a bad person.
You're not.
You're one of the good guys.
And I got a whole glee club
that agrees with me.
Give me a day.
One day
before you pack it all up.
One day... to be the hero
we all know you are.
And then, you know, you can...
decide where you really belong.
I
I wish I could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing
Nothing will keep us
together
We can beat them
Forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes
Just for one day
I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be heroes
Forever and ever
Then we can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day.
Well?
What's your decision?
One last mission first.
You in?
Hey.
Listen, I hate
to do this, but...
I have to reschedule
our date on Friday.
What?
Wh-Why?
I have to study.
And, uh...
I have my first appointment
with a dyslexia specialist
on Saturday, and he's, like,
the best in Ohio, so he could
only squeeze me in
at 7:00 a.m.,
which means I have to go
straight home after the game.
Well...
I was really looking forward
to hanging out.
Me, too. I-I just...
It's really important.
I want this to be
the first semester
I hand my mom a report card
with an "A" on it.
How about next Friday?
Can we go out then?
Sure.
Awesome. Thanks.
Ouch. That sounded like
the beginning of the end.
What do you mean? "I can't go
out because I have to study"?
Sounded an awful lot like "I'm
not that into you." Well,
he has to get up early
to see a doctor.
Is that what
it is? Or is it
maybe all the yogurt-covered
raisins?
Don't listen to what
everybody else is saying...
I don't think
you look bloated at all.
But if you want to
win his attention,
you should really
hit the elliptical.
Stat.
You know what?
The old Marley would
have sat home alone
on a Friday night, but the new
superheroine Marley's
not gonna wait around.
Hi.
What are you doing
Friday night?
Uh...
going on a date with you.
Good.
SAM:
Guys, it was epic.
Dalton was like Death Star
meets Mordor meets
Temple of Doom.
I mean, I might be
exaggerating, but probably not.
I owe all of you an apology
for ever doubting
McKinley's my home.
You guys are my home.
We've got a real fight
ahead of us
with the Warblers
at Sectionals,
but I am not worried at all.
Because we've got the team,
we've got the talent, and...
we have,
most importantly,
the leader.
Thank you.
That's you, Finn!
Go put that in the case.
I love you, Finn!
All right, all right,
all right, all right,
all right.
Let's start with some warm-ups,
and then we can... Uh, Finn, wait.
Can I say something?
This is for you,
from all of us.
ARTIE: It's a superhero
utility belt
cleverly disguised
as a fanny pack.
There's some stuff in there
we thought you could use.
Ah, cool, uh...
Magic markers.
I could never find these.
Antacid.
In case you get
the show choir squirts.
Thanks.
BRITTANY:
That's from me.
You're welcome.
BLAINE: That's to
always remind you
that you're the almighty
Treble Clef,
the Uniter of Glee Clubs.
And the Uniter of Friends.
Wow.
Uh... I don't
know what to say.
I'll never let you down.
I promise.
Okay, come on, huddle up.
All right, let's huddle up.
Next week at Sectionals,
we are gonna kick some
Warblers' sorry asses. Yes.
And then it's Regionals,
and then it's Nationals,
and then this year
is gonna go down
in the McKinley High
record books
as the greatest year the
New Directions! Has ever seen.
Onwards and upwards!
ALL:
Amazing!
Some nights I stay up
cashing in my bad luck
Some nights
I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that
my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish
they'd just fall off
But I still wake up,
I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure
what I stand for
Oh, what do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know
Anymore
This is it, boys,
this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break
the rules already?
I was never one
to believe the hype
Save that for the black
and white, try twice as hard
And I'm half as liked
But here they come again
to jack my style
That's all right
That's all right
I found a martyr
in my bed tonight
Stops my bone
from wondering just
Who I, who I am
Oh, who am I?
Mmm
MARLEY:
Who am I?
Who am I?
Well
Some nights I wish
that this all would end
'Cause I could use
some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared
you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win,
I always win
But I still wake up
I still see your ghost,
oh, Lord, I'm still not sure
What I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know
Oh, come on
JOE:
So, this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands
of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
So, come on  Oh, come on
Come on
Oh, come on!
Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
The other night
you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had
about you and me
I called you up,
but we'd both agree
Oh, come on!
It's for the best
you didn't listen
Oh
It's for the best
we get our distance
Oh, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh.
