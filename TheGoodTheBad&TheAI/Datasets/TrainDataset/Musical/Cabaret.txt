Every night we have the battle to keep

So don't go away.
Who knows?
Tonight we may lose the battle.

To Cabaret
Have you a cigarette, darling?
I am desperate!
Oh, yes.
-Yes, I think so.
-Oh, fantastic.
You're American.
Oh, God, how depressing.
You're meant to think
I'm an international woman of mystery.
Been working on it like mad, heh.
I was told there might be
a room to rent here.
Not too expensive, l--
I hope.
Divine decadence.
-I'm Sally Bowles.
-I'm Brian Roberts.
SALLY:
Come in, Brian darling.
Oh.
Oh, God, I've even begun
to think in German, heh.
-How long have you been here?
-Forever.
-How long is that?
-Almost three months.
It's the most marvelous boarding house.
Marvelous lodgers.
Everybody's broke, of course,
but who isn't these days?
Now, there's Fräulein Mayr,
who's a masseuse, for ladies only.
And there's Fräulein Kost,
who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.
Fräulein Kost, Fräulein Mayr.
Mayr tells Kost's fortune every morning.
And it's always the same.
"You'll meet a strange man," which under
the circumstances is a pretty safe bet.
Fräulein Kost's room.
Oh, you can just imagine.
Here it is, darling.
Oh.
Well, what else do you need in a bedroom
besides a bed?
Pupils. I've got to give English lessons
to pay the rent.
Well, look, you can use my room for that.
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.
You'll adore these.
Prairie oysters, darling.
It's an egg with Worcestershire sauce,
all sort of whooshed up together.
Fifty marks with breakfast,
even when I'm behind on the rent.
Divine, isn't it?
-Of course, I'm hardly ever in.
-Why not?
Oh, well, I dash all day
and I work late at the cabaret.
Now, these work instantly,
even on the most sinister hangovers.
Of course, I may bring a boyfriend home
occasionally, but only occasionally...
...because I do think that one ought
to go to the man's room if one can.
I mean, it doesn't look so much
as if one expected it, does it?
Exactly.
BRIAN: I see you've acquired a lot
of worldly wisdom.
Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts.
I have ancient instincts.
And I have this strange, mystical...
...that-ish feeling about you.
So you're moving right in, okay?
-Okay?
-Heh.
Okay.
Prairie oysters?
Cheers.
Peppermint prairie oyster?
Oh, you got the toothpaste glass.
Ladies und gentlemen.
-The Kit Kat Klub is proud to present....
-The Kit Kat Klub.
A very beautiful young lady.
-She is so beautiful...
MC: She is so beautiful...
-...and so talented, so...
MC: ...and so talented, so....
MC: ...charming, I have only yesterday said,
"l want you for my wife." Und she said:
MC & SALLY:
"Your wife, what would she want with me?"
I give you that international sensation...
...Fräulein Sally Bowles.
You have to understand
The way I am, Mein Herr
A tiger is a tiger
Not a lamb, Mein Herr
You'll never turn the vinegar
To jam, Mein Herr
So I do
What I do
When I'm through
Then I'm through
And I'm through
Toodle-oo
Bye-bye
Mein Lieber Herr
Farewell, Mein Lieber Herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me
Mein Herr
Don't dab your eye, Mein Herr
Or wonder why, Mein Herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me
Mein Herr
The continent of Europe
Is so wide, Mein Herr
Not only up and down
But side to side, Mein Herr
I couldn't ever cross it
If I tried, Mein Herr
But I do
What I can
Inch by inch
Step by step
Mile by mile
Man by man
Bye-bye
Mein Lieber Herr
Farewell, Mein Lieber Herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me
Mein Herr
Don't dab your eye, Mein Herr
Or wonder why, Mein Herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me
Mein Herr
Bye-bye, Mein Lieber Herr
Bye-bye, Mein Lieber Herr
Bye-bye
Mein Herr
And bye-bye
Bye-bye, Mein Lieber Herr
Farewell, Mein Lieber Herr
It was a fine affair
But now it's over
And though I used to care
I need the open air
You're better off without me
You're better without me
Mein
Herr
Come over.
You know, you're really very good.
I know, darling, isn't it fabulous?
Listen, I want you to meet Fritz Wendel,
absolutely my oldest friend in Berlin.
-Brian Roberts.
-He's a divine playboy...
...hurtling from party to party,
seducing everyone in all directions.
You mustn't believe Sally.
I'm a serious man of business.
Making import-export with machineries.
SALLY:
Ha, heh.
Listen, Fritz is crazy to improve his English
so he can dazzle fat American divorcees.
-Sally.
-And I said you might deign...
...to give him lessons. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Darling, give me one of those cigarettes.
Oh, you've got to try one
of these. They're absolutely devastating.
I'm sure they're filled with opium
or something.
They make me feel wildly sensual.
FRITZ:
She's hot stuff, yes?
No, thank you.
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.
That is correct? "On"?
-"With."
-"With." With.
Her father, you know,
is a big ambassador from Washington.
-An ambassador?
-Oh, yes, dear chap.
And soon, with her, I think
I'm entering the high diplomatic circles.
Strict rules will be obeyed.
Sally tells me, sir,
that you're from Oxford University.
-A professor of language.
-Heh.
Well, it's, it's Cambridge, actually...
...and I'm still working
for my doctor of philosophy.
-That's why I'm here.
-Hmm.
But if you really want lessons,
I'd be pleased to help.
Excellent.
If it's.... If it's not too expensive.
You know, business is....
Business is terrible.
The inflation, the Communists, the Nazis.
Soon I am with a tin cup too...
...or I make a rich marriage.
That at least is sensible.
SALLY: I suppose you're wondering
what I'm doing...
-...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub.
BRIAN: It is a rather unusual place.
That's me, darling,
unusual places, unusual love affairs.
I am a most strange
and extraordinary person.
Now, tell me all about you.
I want to hear everything.
Everything?
Absolutely everything.
Well, there's nothing very dramatic
to tell.
Since I've been down from Cambridge--
Lya De Putti.
Absolutely my favorite screen siren.
-Well, when I left Cambridge, l--
-I'm gonna be a great film star.
That is, if booze and sex
don't get me first.
Do I shock you, darling?
Not a bit.
I don't?
SALLY:
Since mother died, we're even closer.
BRIAN:
He's an ambassador, I understand.
SALLY: Who told you that?
BRIAN: Fritz Wendel.
SALLY:
Oh, Fritz.
He's practically an ambassador.
-Where is he now?
-Oh, who knows?
Timbuktu, outer Mongolia.
He dashes all over the globe
on momentous affairs of state.
Then you don't see much of him.
Oh, darling, what are you talking about?
Of course, I do.
He can't bear us being apart.
He's always swooping down
and carrying me off for divine vacations.
Hmm, the Riviera, Capri.
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.
Oh, I know I can sing,
but what I really want to be is an actress.
Like, uh.... Who is it?
Uh, Lya De Putti?
Oh, darling, come on.
I could act her right off the screen.
I thought you said she was your favorite.
She makes too many faces.
-No, please.
-We made an agreement.
Thank you.
Just you wait.
One of these days, Max Reinhardt
is gonna drift into the club.
Well, you never know.
That's right, you never know.
It has happened before.
Why, just last week,
a man who's a very good friend...
...of the head of casting for UFA
asked me to sit at his table, and he's--
Oh.
-Oh, come on. Come on.
-What?
SALLY:
Run, run!
-Run!
BRIAN: Why?
Oh.
Excuse me, miss...
...but didn't you just scream?
Does my company upset
you that much? Heh, heh.
You know, sometimes
I come down here and just wait.
I mean, just especially.
-You should try it sometime.
-Hm?
-Yes.
-Me?
-You.
-No.
-Yes, you.
-No.
-Oh, go on.
-I couldn't possibly.
Don't be so British.
-No.
-You'll feel terrific afterwards.
-No.
-You know you want to.
No, I don't. No.
-Here comes one now.
-No. Uh-uh.
-Will you do it?
-All right.
-Aah--
-No, no, not yet. Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, you ready?
Now.
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Whoo!
SALLY: I can't promise you anything,
but we can give it a try.
Darling, I want you to meet Herr Ludwig.
He's just back from Hamburg.
He lives in the room off the kitchen.
He's a marvelous publisher.
Look, he's got this book,
and it's got to be translated.
And I told him
what a famous writer you are.
-And it's 50 marks. Right?
LUDWIG: Mm-hm.
It's all settled.
It will be an honor for me
to associate with...
...so talented a young man of letters
as Miss Bowles tells me.
This book, I assure you, is most artistic.
Most artistic and color--
-Twenty-five marks in advance. Right?
-Yeah, yeah.
SALLY:
Oh.
I think you will find the style--
Is there any hot water left?
-Hot water?
-Yes, yes, a little.
I think, Herr Roberts,
you will find the style admirable...
...and the subject matter,
I feel, is universal.
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.
No, no, you must. It's the finest Havana.
It's a deal?
Well, Herr Ludwig, I'm afraid that Sally's
rather overestimated my powers of....
It's a deal.
That's it.
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?
Do you know what this artistic
and colorful book's about?
No. Tell, tell.
It's pure pornography.
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.
Hmm. What's this one called?
Hmm?
"Cleo, the Whip Lady."
Oh. Tsk.
You lied about the hot water.
I'm freezing.
I'm freezing to death.
Hug me?
Tighter.
Mm.
Brian, don't be so literal.
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?
Well, doesn't it?
It's a very nice body.
Do you really think so, darling?
It does have a certain kind of style.
I mean, look, it's very flat here...
...not much hips, and...
...here....
It's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.
Oh. You don't.
Well, listen, we're practically
living together, so if you only like boys...
...l mean, I wouldn't dream
of pestering you.
-Do you sleep with girls or don't you?
-Sally.
-You don't ask questions like that.
-I do.
All right.
If you insist.
I do not sleep with girls.
No, no, no.
Let me be absolutely accurate.
I've gone through the motions
of sleeping with girls exactly three times.
All of them disastrous.
The word for my sex life now is "nil."
Or as you Americans would say...
..."plenty of nothing."
All right?
Well, why didn't you tell me
in the first place?
Look, Brian...
...you're absolutely my best friend.
And friends are much harder to find
than lovers.
Besides, sex always screws up
a friendship, anyway, if you let it.
So we won't let it. Heh. Okay?
Okay?
Okay, Sally.
FRITZ: You would have been, he would
have been, we would have been...
...you would have been,
they would have been.
BRIAN:
Pluperfect tense.
FRITZ:
I have been-- Being.
Oh, no, no, no.
If you did a little homework
instead of gadding about all over town....
Fräulein Schneider,
there's a new pupil coming at 3.
-Would you show her up, please?
SCHNEIDER: Certainly.
BRIAN:
Oh, leave the door.
You had been being,
they had been being....
Future perfect.
I shall have....
I shall have been. This English.
I go now to try to pull a deal.
Or I make business soon...
...or I go as a gigolo.
-"Either, or."
-"Either, or," I go as a gigolo.
Anyway, who is the new pupil?
Natalia Landauer.
Landauer?
Of the big department store?
Uh-huh.
-A Landauer?
-Mm-hm.
How did you meet a Landauer?
I had a letter of introduction
from England.
They invited me for coffee.
Invited you for coffee?
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.
Stinking rich, it seems.
Good.
I shall make a pass after her.
What if she's fat and hideous?
Perhaps the father will take
a liking from me and give me a job.
If I marry her, a partnership perhaps.
-I'm not.... I'm not prejudiced.
-Hmm.
-Hello.
BRIAN: You said you wouldn't be back till 4.
-I must have a drink this instant.
BRIAN: Sally.
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?
Oh, God, only gin.
Sally, please.
Three marks an hour. I need it.
-We need it.
-All I need is a drink.
She's young
and very strictly brought up, so--
Look, I may have my tiny faults...
...but I'm really not planning
to white-slave her to Latin America.
Whose room is this, anyhow?
-Sally, in all fairness, you said--
-Fairness? Who cares about fairness?
Honestly.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
BRIAN: Excuse me.
-How fat?
-Hmm?
-How fat?
Fräulein Landauer.
Oh, come in.
-Good afternoon, Fräulein Landauer.
NATALIA: Good afternoon.
BRIAN: How nice to see you again.
NATALIA: It's nice to see you again.
Ah, it is good, you have others.
So we shall make a party
for speaking English, yes?
Oh, well, actually,
my friends were just leaving.
No, no, no, I'm delighted to stay, Brian.
Sally, you have this appointment,
don't you?
I'll cancel it. I love parties.
Good, this is splendid for the practicing.
You will introduce me, please.
Oh, yes, of course.
Herr Wendel, Fräulein Landauer.
No, no, English conversation.
I am so charmed, dearest miss.
And, uh, this...
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.
How do you do?
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.
Last summer when I....
l, uh....
l....
NATALIA:
You are all healthy, I hope.
Yes.
I have had a cold, but it is better now.
SALLY:
Oh, good.
How sad.
A cold from the nose
is most aggravating.
This was a cold of the bosom,
not of the nose.
-Oh.
-All the "plegm" was here.
All the what?
The "plegm" that comes in the tubes.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
"Phlegm." P-H is always
pronounced as F...
...and you don't sound the G.
Then why are they putting the G, please?
Heh, that's a very good question,
but rather difficult to explain.
Try, Bri.
Well, uh....
It's just there.
So Mr. Professor, you do not know?
No.
Then I'm sorry, I cannot help you.
It's most amusing.
Very amusing.
BRIAN : Oh, how thoughtful
of you, Fräulein Schneider.
Thank you very much.
SCHNEIDER:
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.
FRITZ:
Please.
Please, you must take a cake,
dearest miss.
I'm not eating between meals.
You're not eating between meals.
I am eating between meals.
Thank you. So much.
You're welcome.
Oh, Bri, Liebling, did I tell you?
I saw a film the other day about syphilis.
Oh, it was too awful.
I couldn't let a man touch me for a week.
Coffee?
-Is it true you can get it from kissing?
-Oh, yes.
And your king, Henry Vlll...
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey
whisper in his ear.
That is not, I think, founded in fact.
But from kissing, most decidedly.
And from towels and from cups.
And, of course, screwing.
"Screwing," please?
Oh, uh, fornication.
Fornication?
Oh, Bri, darling, what is the German word?
I don't remember.
SALLY:
Um....
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, no.
Oh.
That would be the one German word
you pronounce perfectly.
Well, I ought to. I spent the entire afternoon
"bumsening" like mad...
...with some ghastly old producer
who promised to give me a contract.
Gin, Miss Landauer?
SALLY:
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?
BRIAN:
Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke.
SALLY: That old heel-clicking, hand-kissing
routine won't get him anywhere with her.
The only thing to do with virgins
is to make a ferocious pounce.
BRIAN: Ha-ha, I can't imagine anyone
pouncing on Natalia.
SALLY: That's why it would be
so effective, darling.
NATALIA: You are a woman
of many sexual experiences, I think.
SALLY: I'll say, darling. Ever since I was so
high, men have found me irresistible.
-Daddy was always worrying that....
NATALIA: Yes?
SALLY:
You know.
How's the, uh, gigolo campaign going?
Terrible.
This week, already I'm giving up
three dinner invitations...
...to spend 32 marks on her.
-That's quite a sacrifice.
-Mm-hm.
And here is the craziness.
I like it.
-Goddamn it.
-What?
I think I'm falling in love with her.
BRIAN:
I'm so sorry.
FRITZ:
So am I.
You assure me the English reader
will find this...
...arousing, stimulating?
Well, I, uh....
Yes, yes, I should think so.
SALLY:
Look, everybody.
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?
-You look lovely, Sally.
-Just lovely.
Thank you. Well, I'm off to the Adlon...
...to see my sexy,
marvelous, devastating father.
Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.
Good luck.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, but I couldn't
possibly find any more of them.
Oh, good night, and thank you so much
for a delightful evening.
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.
-Good night.
-Good night.
It really has been sublime.
Thank you.
Dearest miss.
You see how she is with me?
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?
No, l-- I was too discreet to look back.
I think I go--
I go crazy with the frustration.
You know, I kiss and inside me
comes the explosion. But her?
Brian, I tell you a simple fact...
-...and I'm not boosting.
-"Boasting."
Hmm. The French women,
the Swedish women, even the English...
...they go wild for my kisses, but...
...this one....
Nothing?
Nothing.
And I'm a crazy, lovesick fool.
Sally says you ought to pounce.
Pounce?
Oh, throw her on a couch or something.
To attack Natalia?
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable
in these areas.
Sally.
You do what Sally says and you end up,
I think, in the prison cell.
Pounce, huh?
Pounce.
Sally?
How'd it go?
Bad?
Sally, what is it?
SALLY:
I waited at the Adlon till 10.
When I got back, there was this.
"Dear Sally:
Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.
Writing. Love."
Well, these things do happen.
-I'm sure he had a good reason.
-Hmm.
Ten words. Exactly.
After 10 it's extra.
You see, Daddy thinks of these things.
If I had leprosy, there'd be a cable.
"Gee, kid, tough.
Sincerely hope nose doesn't fall off.
Love."
That bastard!
I'll show him!
I'll become a big film star.
The poor man, he tries to love me.
Perhaps he even thinks he does.
But the real truth...
...is that he just doesn't care.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I'm not worth caring about.
Maybe I am just nothing.
You're a perfectly marvelous girl.
SALLY:
Oh, no.
-And beautiful.
-No.
-And talented.
-No, I'm not.
Yes. Yes, you are.
Do you really think so?
-I mean, really?
-Yes.
Yes, I do.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Brian.
Maybe this time I'll be lucky
Maybe this time he'll stay
Obviously those three girls...
-...were the wrong three girls. Ha, ha, ha.
-Just the wrong three girls.
Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?
SALLY:
Mm-hm.
He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time
And the time before
Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady Peaceful
Lady Happy
That's what I long to be
Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's gotta happen
Happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win
Cause everybody
Oh, they love a winner
So nobody loved me
Lady Peaceful
Lady Happy
That's what I long to be
Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's gotta happen
Happen sometime
Maybe this time
I'll win
-Hello?
-Hey, what's going on?
Brian. I'm sorry, Willi insisted.
Tell him your lover
is a gangster from Chicago.
SALLY:
Hmm.
-You told him?
-I did better than that.
I just told him that
I had the teeniest touch of syphilis.
Wait till he gets a load
of what little old Elke's got.
SALLY: Landauer?
MAN: Yeah.
NATALIA: I am grateful to you
that you came to me from my call.
SALLY:
Don't be silly. I'm all agog.
-You will eat food, please?
-Oh, thank you.
-You see, Fräulein--
-Sally.
Sally.
Our acquaintance is not long,
but I am choosing you...
...because I know no other young woman
who is giving her body frequently to men.
Oh, my English.
I'm rending you an embarrassment?
No, no, I'm fascinated.
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.
At first I not taking this seriously.
He is so....
So formal.
And also I think so much...
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune.
Is that what you say?
That's what we say, all right. Heh.
Then...
...the night before yesterday...
...my parents are from the house...
...und we are seated here...
...upon my father's library sofa.
Suddenly...
...he throws aside the formalities...
-...there is fire, there is passion.
-Oh, my God.
-He pounced.
-Please?
He....
He made love to you.
On my father's library sofa.
Und even for that,
he is showing no respect.
I am fighting,
I'm calling out harsh words, but then....
May we not be frank?
Suddenly...
...all is equal fire...
...equal passion in me.
And since then, I think only of him.
Now, is this love...
...or mere fatuation of the body?
You, with so many, as you call,
"screwings"...
...shall please tell me the truth of it.
Please.
Heh. Does it matter?
As long as you're having fun.
How can you speak of fun?
He has asked me to marry him.
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?
And say to my father that I am marrying
a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?
And a Christian too.
Oh, this, I think, is breaking his heart.
Well, in that case, I guess
you better just forget the whole thing.
NATALIA:
Forget Fritz?
-How am I ever forgetting Fritz?
-Look, I really have to be running along.
Oh, no.
Don't cry.
Oh, please, don't cry.
I'm no good at all if anybody cries.
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...
...you see, I thought....
I didn't think....
How shall so grave a problem
resolve itself?
You poor thing.
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up.
I don't suppose you'd ever consider
seeing him on the sly every now....
No, I didn't think so.
My God, it's enough
to drive a girl into a convent.
Do they have Jewish nuns?
SALLY :
What?
I think you dropped this.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, but--
-Excuse me, may I help you?
I want--
I want my laundry back by Tuesday.
Well, it's okay.
Thank you so much.
Maximilian von Heune.
Sally Bowles.
Do you have a cigarette?
I'm absolutely desperate.
I must have left mine at the club.
The Kit Kat Klub.
Divine decadence.
MAXIMILIAN: May I drop you somewhere?
I have my car outside.
All right.
Auf wiedersehen, darling.
Money.
Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go around
It makes the world go round
A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
-A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
-A buck or a pound
Is all that makes the world go around
That clinking, clanking sound
Can make the world go round
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
If you happen to be rich
And you feel like a night's entertainment
You can pay for a gay escapade
If you happen to be rich and alone
And you need a companion
You can ring, ding-a-ling, for the maid
If you happen to be rich
And you find you are left by your lover
And you moan and you groan quite a lot
You can take it on the chin
Call a cab and begin to recover
-On your 14-carat yacht
-What?
Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the....
Go around
Of that we both are sure
On being poor
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
When you haven't any coal in the stove
You freeze in the winter
And you curse to the wind at your fate
When you haven't any shoes on your feet
Your coat's thin as paper
And you look 30 pounds underweight
When you go to get a word of advice
From the fat little pastor
He will tell you to love evermore
But when hunger comes to rap
Rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat at the window
-At the window.
-Who's there?
-Hunger.
-Oh, hunger!
See how love flies out the door
Money makes the world go around
The world go around, the world
Money makes the world go around
The clinking, clanking sound
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Get a little, get a little
Money, money, money, money
A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
That clinking, clanking, clunking sound
Is all that makes the world go round
It makes the world go round
MAXIMILIAN:
It's called Türkenblut.
"Turk's blood." A famous German drink.
SALLY:
Oh.
Ah, it's divine.
I'll never drink anything else.
Prost, my friend.
Well, mes enfants,
you are, like me, adrift in Berlin.
I think it's my duty to corrupt you.
Agreed?
Fascinating.
Let's go to the Kempinski.
SALLY:
Darling, he's a baron.
He never even told me.
Class.
He must know everybody.
I bet a man like that could get me into films
faster than you can say Erich von Stroheim.
In exchange for a little infidelity.
MAN:
A little infidelity? ldiot.
Don't worry, I can handle him.
Trust me. Just trust me, darling.
All right, don't trust me.
I had a marvelous time last night.
So did I.
Darling.
-Darling.
-Hmm?
Bri, darling, wake up.
We have a visitor. Maximilian's here.
SALLY: Three-thirty. Heh.
MAXIMILIAN: Sorry, Brian, we're late.
SALLY: Oh, darling,
we had the most glorious time.
MAXIMILIAN: We didn't stop laughing, heh.
-Don't open your eyes.
Don't look. Okay.
Isn't it fabulous? Oh!
-I feel just like Kay Francis.
-Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, Bri, why didn't you come?
We had the best time. It was so much fun.
-Max really knows how to corrupt a girl.
-I try.
SALLY:
Not only did I get this glorious pelt...
...l got perfume, I got silk stockings--
And you got that funny little blue hat.
SALLY:
Oh, you call it funny.
I think it's divine. I love it.
Oh, God,
we didn't get anything for Brian.
MAXIMILIAN: I'm afraid I had no time
to have it wrapped.
Darling, isn't that beautiful?
What on earth makes you think
I'd accept that?
-To give me pleasure.
-Max loves buying things.
Brian, you're a man
of strong convictions.
Can we have caviar again?
MAXIMILIAN:
But you had it for breakfast.
SALLY:
Can I have it for lunch?
For lunch, for dinner, breakfast again.
Anything you want.
Uh, dry caviar, bitter.
That's for me. What are you having?
The lady, with the thing--
And we were in the car and she came--
You should have been there.
MAXIMILIAN: The Nazis are just a gang of
stupid hooligans...
...but they do serve a purpose.
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.
-But who exactly is "we"?
MAXIMILIAN: Germany, of course.
SALLY:
Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar?
-Why not?
SALLY: Oh, wonderful.
I'm dying to show off my new coat.
BRIAN: I think I could do with a drink too.
MAXIMILIAN: Good.
We'll make a night of it.
Or why not a weekend?
MC: Berlin makes strange bedfellows
these days.
Some people have one people.
Some have two.
Some even....
Two ladies
Two ladies
Und I'm the only man, ja
I like it
They like it
This two-for-one
WOMEN:
Two ladies
WOMEN:
Two ladies
WOMAN: And he's the only man
-Yeah
I like it
GIRLS:
We like it
This two-for-one
I do the cooking
Ah!
GIRL 1:
I make the beds
I go out daily to earn our daily bread
-But we've one thing in common
-He
-She
-Und me
-The key
-Diddily-dee
The key
Ooh!
Come on, come on.
ALL:
Whoo!
Two ladies
-Und he's the only man
-Yeah
Whoo! Ha, ha, ha!
We switch partners daily
To play as we please
-Twosies beats onesies
-But nothing beats threes
I sleep in the middle
-I'm left
-Und I'm right
But there's room on the bottom
If you drop in some night
Two ladies
MC:
Come on.
Und I'm the only man, ja
I like it
They like it
This two-for-one
SALLY: What'd he say?
-He's asking about his asthma.
MAN:
Miss Bowles in Mother's room, I thought.
Mr. Roberts in the blue room.
No, no, help yourself.
Please.
I'm not quite sure,
but I think they're mine.
This used to be my room
before I was married.
Heh, looks familiar.
You can at least get out of that shirt.
Try this one. Blue should be your color.
Brian, not even a sweater?
Are you still married?
Very much so.
-Where is your wife now?
-In Cologne.
For the culture.
She lends her support to the arts.
She in her way, I in mine.
We have quite a special understanding.
That must be useful at times.
What about these?
I was right. Blue is your color.
My dear Stephanie,
I would never desert you.
I find it very interesting.
Your father must be
a very important man, Miss Bowles.
Oh, I'll say, darling.
He's practically an ambassador.
We have the most
marvelous relationship.
The instant he can tear himself away,
he dashes to wherever I am.
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.
Excuse me, but didn't we meet with
Emil Jannings at UFA last winter?
MAN: I don't--
-You do know Emil, don't you?
Ah, I find him trés amusant.
Money.
SALLY: Ha, ha, ha.
MAXIMILIAN: Be careful!
SALLY:
Clara Bow.
BRIAN: That's not Clara Bow.
SALLY: It's early Clara Bow.
Wait, I got one. I got one.
Late Sally Bowles. Ha, ha, ha.
BRIAN:
You said it.
MAXIMILIAN:
You two are marvelous.
Have you ever been to Africa?
Where, mein Schatz?
Africa.
Let's go, the three of us. Smile, Brian.
MAXIMILLIAN: Sally, you're really talented.
SALLY: What?
MAXIMILLIAN: You're talented.
-Oh!
He wants to take us to Africa.
He must be insane.
More! Come on, please!
More, more, more! Please!
-That's all.
MAXIMILIAN: More!
-More, please!
-More! More!
SALLY: Come on, Max.
-No, no. No.
Oh, please?
Oh, bravo, bravo.
BRIAN:
Hey.
The king of the jungle.
Hey, Brian, you all right?
BRIAN: Sorry.
SALLY: Oops.
It's all right, darling.
You okay?
SALLY:
Oh, darling.
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really.
I mean, the way ports are
all over the world.
-Sounds absolutely exotic.
MAXIMILLIAN: Heh, heh, heh.
MAXIMILIAN: All the way through
Tanganyika and Uganda.
Sure?
Sally, champagne? Hmm?
MAXIMILIAN: Every now and then,
the train stops in the middle of nowhere...
...and right there is a family of giraffes,
nibbling the trees...
...or a herd of zebra
galloping off in a cloud of dust.
And when the flamingos come in,
thousands and thousands of them...
...turning the whole sky pink.
You'll be amazed when you see it.
Hey! Hey, Sally.
-Are you quite comfortable?
SALLY: Hmm.
Come on.
-Oh!
-Ha, ha, ha.
Sally has an endearing charm...
...but I must admit I find it peaceful
when she's taking her nap. Heh, heh.
To Africa.
MAN :
The sun on the meadow Is summery warm
The stag in the forest runs free
But gather together
To greet the storm
Tomorrow belongs to me
The branch of the linden
Is leafy and green
The Rhine gives its gold to the sea
But somewhere a glory awaits unseen
Tomorrow belongs to me
The babe in his cradle is closing his eyes
The blossom embraces the bee
ALL:
"But soon," says a whisper, "arise, arise"
Tomorrow belongs to me
Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign
Your children have waited to see
The morning will come
When the world is mine
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs to me
Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign
Your children have waited to see
The morning will come
When the world is mine
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs to me
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs to me
Do you still think you can control them?
PEOPLE: Oh, fatherland, fatherland
Show us the sign
Your children have waited to see
The morning will come
When the world is mine
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs
Tomorrow belongs to me
-Natalia.
-Fritz, you frightened me.
I'm sorry, but I must speak to you.
No, no, go away. Please, go away.
I told you not to come.
Natalia, please.
The situation is impossible.
We must not see each other anymore.
Is it the money? Is it that?
I did think it was the money at first.
But not now.
Now I know that you love me.
I know you are an honest man
who would never, never lie to me.
Natalia, I beg of you, marry me.
I can't.
Is it your parents? Isn't it?
It's not my parents. It is me.
It is you too.
Fritz, be careful!
What am I doing?
I've never jumped
on a running board before.
Are you all right?
Why won't you marry me?
Don't you see what is happening
in Germany today?
I'm a Jew.
You are not.
Goodbye, dear Fritz.
SALLY:
Hmm.
I told Schneider we'd be gone
for at least two months, maybe more.
She cried and cried
and said she'd miss us.
The only reason she was crying
is she knows...
...she can't get 50 marks a month from
anybody else for these pitiful little rooms.
You know:
Money makes the world go around
The world go--
Where have you been?
I've been packing for hours.
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.
Oh, your laundry came back.
It's over there on the bed.
You know, Bri, it occurred to me.
I know I've handled Max brilliantly...
...but enough with the African moon.
I mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it...
...if he asked me to become the next
Baroness von Heune und Regensburg?
I've been looking for that for months.
I mean, stranger things have happened.
I wouldn't dream of accepting him,
of course.
For God's sake,
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.
I mean, really hear yourself.
Christ!
Aren't you ever gonna stop
deluding yourself? Hmm?
"Handling Max."
Behaving like some ludicrous
little underage femme fatale.
You're about as fatale
as an after-dinner mint.
Oh, heh.
Well, darling, we all know...
...about your vast experiences
with les femmes...
...fatales or otherwise.
Look, why don't you just
come out with it?
You can't stand Maximilian
because he's everything that you're not.
He doesn't have to give English lessons
for 3 marks an hour.
He's rich.
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books.
He's suave and he's divinely sexy.
And he really appreciates a woman.
Oh, screw Maximilian!
I do.
So do I.
You two bastards!
Two?
Shouldn't that be three?
I think your paper and your party
are pure crap, sir.
I said:
And so are you.
I hear you took on the entire
Nazi party single-handed.
Only two? Ha, ha, ha.
-Sounds like "cigarette"?
-Hmm.
-Feel up to a little surprise?
-Hm.
You poor thing, you're blind.
Here.
"Dear Sally and Bri."
In that order, please note.
"l know you will forgive me,
but family affairs make it imperative...
...for me to leave for Argentina
immediately.
It was fun, wasn't it?" Heh.
Signed, "Maximilian."
Argentina, my ass.
Oh, he also sent this.
Three hundred marks.
For the two of us.
It's $150 each.
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...
...that puts us about on a par
with Fräulein Kost. Heh, heh.
Some gold-diggers, aren't we?
BRIAN:
Hmm.
-Oh, Brian, I'm so sorry.
-Shh.
-Oh, darling.
-Oh!
ALL:
Whoo!
-Whee!
-Whoo!
BRIAN:
Hello.
Something the matter?
What is it, Sally? What's happened?
Goddamn it, I'm gonna have a baby!
SALLY:
Well, aren't you gonna ask?
BRIAN:
All right.
-Whose is it?
SALLY: I don't know!
I really don't know.
BRIAN: What are you going to do?
SALLY: Obviously, I can't have it.
The doctor I went to said he'll do it.
But it's expensive.
He has to bribe somebody or other
for some kind of a certificate or something.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, there goes my fur coat.
I would like to marry you.
BRIAN:
Eggs.
-A touch of toothpaste.
SALLY: Naturally.
BRIAN: A lot of gin.
-Ha, ha, ha.
BRIAN:
All whooshed up together.
BRIAN: With this spiked prairie oyster,
I thee wed.
SALLY:
To the future.
BRIAN: With any luck,
I'll get a fellowship at King's.
SALLY:
Oh, dear, what's that?
My college at Cambridge.
-You'll absolutely love it there.
-Oh, I know I will.
-It's crazy.
-What?
Me. Wanting to be an actress. Heh, heh.
I guess babies love you automatically,
don't they?
They don't have much of a choice.
-To you and the baby.
-To me and the baby.
Probably is yours.
But I don't suppose
we'll ever know for sure.
So what?
You sure you won't mind?
Honestly?
Honestly.
Oh, Bri.
-To me and the baby.
-To you and the baby.
To you. You.
Me? To me.
-And the baby.
-And the baby.
BRIAN:
Mm, mm.
-Oh, where are you going?
-I'll be right back.
-Brian!
-Hmm?
You are a most strange
and extraordinary person.
I know, I know.
The proud father.
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. I can't believe it.
How's Natalia?
Please, I do not speak of Natalia.
-Bad as that?
-Bad.
Perhaps I cut myself at the throat.
Uh-huh. Prepositions, Fritz. Prepositions.
FRITZ:
"ln the throat"?
No, just "cut my throat."
LUDWIG:
And I assure you...
...they're all in it together.
If all the Jews are bankers,
then how can they be Communists too?
Subtle.
Very subtle, Fräulein Kost.
If they can't destroy us one way...
...they try the other.
You don't really believe that, do you?
But you read it every day
in the Völkischer Beobachter.
That ridiculous Nazi tripe.
LUDWIG:
It is an established fact, Herr Roberts...
...that there exists a well-organized
international conspiracy...
...of Jewish bankers and Communists.
It's also an established fact,
Herr Ludwig...
...there exists another well-organized group
of which you're obviously a member.
The International Conspiracy
of Horses' Asses.
SCHNEIDER:
I wish the Kaiser was back.
In those days we had order.
I expect Schneider will raise my rent
after that little exhibition.
Oh, well, what the hell?
Let's get on with those prepositions.
What a black day
that I'm meeting that girl!
BRIAN:
I thought you loved her.
FRITZ: Love, love,
who's needing verdammtes love?
You want to hear the big joke on me?
You want to hear it?
I am a Jew.
-So?
-To be a Jew in Germany?
Only a fool is this, I think.
So I come to Berlin and I'm not a Jew.
How did you manage that?
Where it says on my papers "religion"...
...l am writing "Protestant."
So the work comes.
The friends come.
The parties come.
The parties.
My God, whoever dreams
that I shall fall in love with a Jewish girl?
Heh. But surely that solves your problem.
-All you've got to do is tell her--
-Do you understand nothing?
This girl!
Do you know what she has done to me?
It's terrible.
She has turned me into an honest man.
"Oh, you're good," she says.
"A man of integrity
who will never lie to me."
What does she do if I tell her now?
I tell you what she does if I tell her now.
She kicks me out into the streets.
Oh, don't be silly. She'd understand.
Anyway, what have you got to lose?
What do I lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.
All my friends hear I'm a Jew,
they kick me out into the streets.
And then, I think, comes a big Nazi
with a club and bangs me on the head.
Fritz, I really think
you're underestimating Natalia.
What am I doing?
I don't like whiskey.
Look, just tell her.
No, I can't, I can't.
What a coward am I.
I know what you're thinking
You wonder why I chose her
Out of all the ladies in the world
It's just a first impression
What good's a first impression?
If you knew her like I do
It would change your point of view
If you could see her through my eyes
You wouldn't wonder at all
If you could see her through my eyes
I guarantee you would fall
Like I did
When we're in public together
I hear society moan
But if they could see her through my eyes
Maybe they'd leave us alone
How can I speak of her virtues?
I don't know where to begin
She's clever, she's smart
She reads music
She doesn't smoke or drink gin
Like I do
Yet when we're walking together
They sneer if I'm holding her hand
But if they could see her through my eyes
Maybe they'd all understand
Why don't they leave us alone?
Ladies und gentlemen,
I ask you, is it a crime to fall in love?
Can one ever choose
where the heart leads us?
All we ask is...
A little understanding.
Why can't the world live...
Live und let live.
Oh, I understand your objection
I grant you the problem's not small
But if you could see her
Through my eyes
She wouldn't look Jewish at all
FRITZ:
I'm a Jew.
Brian, is anything wrong?
Lazy, that's all.
That's all?
That's all.
Oh! Look what I found.
See?
We must be lucky.
Will you still love me
when I'm blown up like a balloon? Heh.
Will my body drive you wild with desire?
Of course. Why not?
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:
Your life and my life...
...solved in one fell swoop,
and all by the baby.
I guess it's just about the most significant
baby the world has ever known...
...since Jesus. Heh.
It'll be a most strange
and extraordinary baby, won't it?
Good morning, darling.
Darling, would you mind awfully
seeing if there's a bit of brandy left?
Put an egg in it
and we'll call it breakfast. Heh.
I suppose you wonder
what on earth happened to me?
I'm afraid we made a night of it.
BRIAN:
Where's your fur coat?
You did it, didn't you?
Did what, darling?
The abortion.
In God's name...
...why?
One of my whims?
Is that all you can say?
"One of my whims"?
What right...?
If you wanna hit me,
why don't you just hit me?
But you wanted it.
Didn't you?
Me and the baby.
I suppose Max Reinhardt
did show up at the club.
Or was it a friend of a friend of a friend
of an assistant director...
...who said he'd try to squeeze you
into the chorus line?
That is, of course, if you....
If you went to bed with him.
-You think that?
-Yes.
Well, then it's just as well, isn't it?
For you, for everyone.
Now, darling, would you be an angel
and just let me get some sleep?
Tell me why you did it.
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.
Sally, please.
I have to know.
Okay.
I'm self-centered, inconsiderate...
...and what was the third adjective?
Oh, yes.
And I have this infantile fantasy...
...that one day
I'll amount to something as an actress.
Oh, Bri.
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?
A playpen in the bedroom,
diapers on the towel rack.
How soon would it be
before we started hating each other?
How soon would it be before
I started dashing out...
...and disgracing myself
at some nearest pub?
How soon would it be before...?
Before?
Say it.
Go on.
You might as well now.
Forget it.
Just forget it.
I see.
Bri-- Brian.
I really do love you.
Yes. Yes, I think....
I think you do love me.
You all right?
Is there anything I can...
...do for you?
I just think I'll sleep a little while.
Oh, shit.
SALLY:
Magazines?
BRIAN:
No.
SALLY: It's a long trip.
-Yes.
Chocolate?
No.
-Well, we seem to be here.
-Yeah.
I'd love to come down
on the platform with you...
...and wave a tiny white handkerchief,
etcetera...
...but there is that interview.
It may not amount to anything...
-...but you never know. Ha, ha, ha.
-You never know.
Shocking.
I'll see you.
MC:
Ladies und gentlemen...
...l give you that international
sensation...
...Fräulein Sally Bowles.
What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
Put down the knitting
The book and the broom
It's time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow your horn
Start celebrating
Right this way
Your table's waiting
What good's permitting
Some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away?
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret
I used to have this girlfriend
Known as Elsie
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour
The day she died
The neighbors came to snicker
Well, that's what comes
From too much pills and liquor
But when I saw her
Laid out like a queen
She was the happiest corpse
I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how
She'd turn to me and say
What good is sitting
All alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
And as for me
I made my mind up
Back in Chelsea
When I go
I'm goin' like Elsie
Start by admitting
From cradle to tomb
It isn't that long a stay
Life is a cabaret, old chum
It's only a cabaret, old chum
And I love a cabaret
MC :
Ladies and gentlemen.
Where are your troubles now?
Forgotten? I told you so.
We have no troubles here.
Here, life is beautiful.
The girls are beautiful.
Even the orchestra is beautiful.
Auf wiedersehen
