The government is going
to call off all garbage runs.
We are being driven out of this place.
This is not fair to the people
who live here.
If the epidemic is really prevailing
in this area...
they should have done something
a long time ago...
but they didn't do a thing about it.
They didn't try to protect us.
Now look at us. The disease is
wide-spread and everyone is sick.
Now they want us to move into tents
and schools like refugees.
Why should I cooperate with them?
With no prevention,
the epidemic will break out.
THE HOLE
What if we were
carrying the virus?
You can't just move us
anywhere you want to.
Some people have
lived here for generations.
The government can't make us
leave our homes.
A TSAI MING-LIANG FILM
I'll just dump my rubbish anywhere.
To hell with our government.
I'll dump my garbage where I can't see it,
or somewhere other people can't see it.
Or I'll just put them wherever
other people put them...
They should burn us all,
together with the garbage!
Taiwan's Health Administration...
has issued a statement...
in response to sharp criticism
from WHO.
Though we haven't been able to identify
the name of this epidemic or its origin,
we are very confident that
we can take care of it in the shortest time.
The Water Company
also announced...
that starting in the year 2000...
it will cut off the water supply
to all quarantine zones.
And now here's our report.
Seven days to go now...
until the year 2000.
Excuse me.
Are there any leaks in here?
Nope.
There's a bad leak downstairs.
One wall is dripping wet.
They asked me to check around.
Can I have a look inside?
But there's no problem here.
There could be
a busted pipe still.
I really need to have a look.
Just a peek.
Thanks.
Sorry for the bother.
Kitty.
Kitty!
Kitty.
Can I help you, sir?
Do you have this kind of bean sauce?
This brand was discontinued
long time ago.
We have the same thing but only in
different brand.

Come out of there!
Stop it, please!
You hear me?
Get out of there.
Be a man!
Get out now!
Please, get out.
What are you doing?
Please, stop it.
You're scaring me to death.
Get out now, please.
Are you the tenant of Apt. No. 804?
I'm your downstairs neighbor.
The plumber will come
and fix the hole this afternoon.
Will you be home then?
Maybe.
You have to.
Or else it'll never get fixed.
What do you mean,
"It doesn't matter"?
Do you think you're the only plumber
left alive around here?
You think you're so damn good?
- Did you just use the toilet?
- Why?
Because there's a leak
above my toilet.
Can you stop using yours?
I'll ask the plumber to fix it.
What are you doing here?
Drunk again?
What are you doing in there?
Get a hold of him!
Open the door.
Just leave the stretcher here.
Sir, this place is going
to be fumigated. It's not safe.
Please leave for now.
Coconut milk?
Where can I find any
in such foul weather?
I want some now.
I mean it. Now!
What can I do?
Stripping.
Undressing myself.
You want a look?
You want a look?
I'm lying down now.
I'm looking at the hole
you made in the ceiling.
There's an eye staring at me.
Kitty.
Kitty.
Do you know
what a woman needs most?
Wrong.
Wrong again.
Keep guessing.
Guess again.
And?
I love it.
Gesundheit!
