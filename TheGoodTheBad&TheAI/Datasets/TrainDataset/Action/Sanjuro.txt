So he refused?
Count my uncle out.
I gave him our statement requesting a cleanup.
He said, ”As Chamberlain, I already know.”
-Then why?
-So I asked: ”Why overlook corruption while the lord is away?”
He smiled and said, ”Perhaps I'm behind it.
”You think I'm good-natured."
”People aren't what they seem."
”Be careful."
”The worst one is beyond your imagination.”
-And he tore it.
-Tore it?
-He was unreasonable.
-Then?
I gave up on him. I met the Superintendent.
-What did he say?
-He was cooperative.
At first he looked embarrassed,
but the story of my uncle shocked him.
-He pondered.
-”All right,” he said. ”I'll help you.”
”I'll talk with your group.
”Gather them quickly.”
-That's what he said.
-He's great!
-Right!
-A powerful support for us. Not a good-natured scarecrow.
Wait.
-An interesting story.
-Don't let him go!
Fool! If I wanted to run, why would I speak?
Why are you here?
Free room overnight.
By the way, overhearing has a merit.
They say outsiders can be good judges.
Listen.
I say the Chamberlain is all right,
but the Superintendent is no good.
-Don't insult him!
-Take it easy.
I haven't seen them,
so I'm not cheated by their looks.
The Chamberlain is ugly, isn'the?
Right?
But from your story I judge he's a great man.
He doesn't mind being called a fool.
Great!
But the Superintendent...
You mentioned his name with admiration.
That means he looks attractive. Right?
But people aren't what they seem.
-Be careful.
-Shut up, bum!
Wait.
That's what the Chamberlain said.
He said more exactly.
”The worst one"
”is beyond your imagination.”
That is, the Superintendent might be the worst one.
Be still and listen.
What's the Superintendent's job?
To keep his clan calm.
But he incited you to riot.
Don't you think it's odd?
And he told you to gather your men.
You're in danger.
If he's the puppeteer, he'll kill you all.
Don't do as he says.
Watch out.
But we're going to see him here tonight.
What?
I was right.
Look!
Surrounded.
Not even a mouse can escape.
Stop being foolish.
Put your swords away. This is no game.
-Don't order us!
-Suit yourselves.
Die for the Superintendent.
But we're surrounded...
Leave it to me.
Superintendent Kikui sent us.
Surrender!
You're surrounded!
No resistance!
Be quiet!
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Don't intrude into my room!
Looking for trouble?
Watch out. You woke me up. I'm cross.
Pull back!
He's not the man we want.
Besides, it'd take a long time to kill him.
You're strong.
If you want a job, visit me at the Superintendent's place.
I'm Hanbei Muroto.
It's safe now.
Come out.
We don't know how to thank you.
Forget it.
Just give me some money.
I haven't eaten for days.
I need some sake and food.
I'll take just that.
Goodbye.
But what will you do now?
We've learned a lesson. We'll apologize
and follow my uncle's instructions.
You understand. Good boys.
Wait. It won't do.
The Chamberlain's in danger now.
I'd arrest him, if I were the Superintendent.
He sounded as if he knew the worst man.
-Where to?
-My uncle's.
To get caught?
They know you. You have no chance.
-But it was my fault.
-Our fault.
-You did just as we planned.
-But if my uncle...
Stop saying ”my uncle”!
We're all involved in this.
Yes! Live or die, the nine of us...
Ten. You can't take care of yourselves.
It's quiet. Everything seems all right.
No. It's odd. The shutters are still open.
Any fish in the pond?
Many big ones.
Fish.
The Superintendent's men are in my uncle's room.
He's in trouble.
Don't be hasty. Let's wait and see.
We can't move like this, like a centipede.
-Any place to hide?
-There's a barn ahead.
Let's go there.
-Koiso.
-Izaka.
-Stop crying.
-The Chamberlain... He's in trouble.
Calm down. Tell me what happened.
The Superintendent brought a troop in the evening.
-We were eating...
-Myuncle?
-Ten men took him away.
-Kidnapped? Why?
-He had guards.
-They had no chance to fight.
-They're locked up. -My aunt?
-I don't know. She's confined,too.
-Chidori?
I think she's with her mother.
-Guards?
-Fourteen or fifteen.
How could you escape?
The sentries wanted me to bring sake for them.
-Alone?
-A man followed me the first time.
-But not now.
-Send her back.
Back to the guards.
They'd be more cautious
if they found she got away.
Better still, drown them with sake.
Get them drunk.
We can easily rescue the old woman and the girl.
I see.
Koiso,will you go back?
Yes, I will.
She's a samurai.
She's more reliable than you, kids.
I appreciate your help, but watch your tongue.
”The old woman and the girl!”
Don't give us orders for everything we do.
You plan to save the lady, but first the Chamberlain.
Do you know where he is?
No? Then we can't save him now.
What's the Superintendent going to do with him?
We must find that first.
The Superintendent must've told her why he arrested him.
Don't you want to know?
Understand? Then split up.
Four of us, including me, will save the old woman.
The others, find the Chamberlain.
We'll meet at a safe place. Is there any?
We can't go far with the ladies.
-My house is near.
-No! It's next door to Kurofuji.
-Kurofuji?
-One of the traitors.
-Interesting! Good. Let's go there.
-No! You fool!
Can't you say”yes” once in a while?
They'll never think of searching their neighbors.
Three guards.
I'll knock one down, so you two will get him.
Don't kill him.
He may tell us where the Chamberlain is.
While I take care ofthe rest,
go in and rescue the women.
Then run to the barn.
Got it?
Why the look?
You want to use your swords? Forget it.
Stupid friends are dangerous.
You might cut me in the back.
The guardhouse. Your plan seems to have worked.
Now!
Too bad. Change of guards.
Muroto... I met him at the shrine.
He offered me ajob.
-What's he to the Superintendent?
-A brain.
-Let's go now. He's alone.
-You blind?
Those three guards were cats.
He's a tiger, but he's alone.
-Why the racket?
-The guards are drunk.
So are you.
Wash your faces in the pond.
Do it!
I'll take a look. Stand watch.
They arrested my uncle to save evidence of his graft?
They said so?
I see. Good excuse.
Who's that person?
It's hard to explain, but he's our friend.
-He saved our lives.
-Is that so? Thank you.
What's keeping those two?
It's dangerous here.
But I never ran so fast in my life.
Let me rest here, or I can't walk.
I've never been here.
-The hay smells nice.
-I love this smell.
We came here often.
Didn't we?
I'll get the two.
-Why did you come here?
-It's so quie there...
Lying on the hay like this...
with the scent around me...
I become drowsy. Mother...
once I really fell asleep on his arm.
Bad manners.
But...
Really...
It smells nice.
They were shoving his head in the pond to make him talk.
But he wouldn't.
-He only spat water?
-He doesn't know.
Who'd talk?
-Ass! What'll we do?
-He saw us. Kill him.
No. You mustn't.
Was it you who killed the others guards?
I had to. To save you.
I shouldn't say this after you saved us, but
killing people is a bad habit.
You're too sharp. That's your trouble.
You're like a drawn sword.
Sharp, naked without a sheath.
You cut well.
But good swords are kept in their sheathes.
What'll you dowith him?
Come with us, will you?
You'll be safe.
Run! Over the rear wall!
No,that way!
Guard the front!
-Hurry!
-It may be easy for you, but not for us.
-We can't. Can we, Mother?
-Hurry !
Use me as a footstool...
-No, it's rude.
-Go ahead!
-But...
-No buts. Hurry, before I'm forced to kill again!
-Hurry!
-Well then, excuse me.
Hurry! Don't let Kurofuji's men see us.
-I'm hungry. Feed me.
-We're preparing.
-Sake?
-No time for that. Let's discuss what to do.
Sake makes me bright.
They're going to pin their crime on the Chamberlain.
They'll make him write a false confession, then...
Then what?
You can be frank with us.
They'll make him kill himself.
-What shall we do, mother?  That's terrible.
-Don't worry .
Your father is a shrewd old fox.
It won't be easy to make him commit harakiri.
And what are you going to do?
We'll find him and get him back. Then...
That's enough. By shifting the blame,
they've shown their guilt.
If we rescue him, they'll be finished.
-That may be so.
-Can we get him back?
If not,we'll be finished.
Please do your best.
But please, don't use too much violence.
-By the way, may I have your name?
-Myname?
It's...
Tsubaki  Sanjuro .
Going on 40.
You're interesting.
Speaking ofcamellias, they're really beautiful.
Kurofuji's place is called Camellia Mansion.
Let's peek.
How is it?
Very quiet.
Who is it?
A camellia fell.
Why don't you relax and have another drink?
But, Kurofuji...
Will the Chamberlain write a confession so easily?
Leave it to the Superintendent.
Can you trust him? He failed this time.
The Chamberlain is no fool.
We underestimated him. There's a way.
His wife and daughter...
-Who is it?
-Muroto.
Muroto is reportingto Kurofuji.
About Aunt and Chidori?
That means the traitors are with Kurofuji.
The three of them together.
If they're in his house, my uncle is there,too.
Fool! What were the guards doing?
-We can't use the women anymore.
-We can.
The Chamberlain doesn't know we lost them.
The problem is, they must be watching our houses.
They saw you come in. They know we're here.
-That's right. We're in danger.
-Don't worry .
I sent my men to your houses, too.
A man rushed in the Superintendent's.
A man reported to Takebayashi.
-Aren't they together?
-Where's my uncle?
But to carry out their plan,
they'll see the Chamberlain soon. Let's wait.
Don't just sit and wait. The Chamberlain's gone.
Stir up the people, run around shouting ”why?”
They'll want to kill him before that.
Give them no chance.
They'll be shocked and meet.
-What's the drum for?
-As planned.
”We have found that the Chamberlain abused his authority."
”Accused of malfeasance, he tried to destroy evidence."
”Therefore, the elders sent a messenger to our lord in Edo,
and confined him as a precaution."
”He seems to have many followers. Remain calm,
and do not let them incite you.  /Superintendent Kikui.”
They moved quickly.
They're smart enough.
Too bad. If the clan is quiet,
-we can't make a move.
-If we do, we'll fall in their trap.
They'll have enough time to play their game.
No. They'll act.
They don't know we're only ten.
They said ”many followers.”
They must act.
We've done everything.
Relax, Takebayashi.
Pressure the Chamberlain.
-His men?
-They can't make a move.
That worries me.
Desperate men will try anything.
They're dangerous.
All right.
-We'll lure them out once again. And... -We can't.
We can. Let them know where the Chamberlain is.
As you said ,they'll try anythingto get him back.
When they show up,
arrest them.
-Nonsense!
Are you mad?
That's what worries me.
Listen. It won't be here.
We'll lure them out somewhere else.
Show them we're meeting there.
Don't worry. There'll be no danger.
Only our palanquins will meet.
We don't have to be in them.
-They're moving!
-I'll follow them. Tell our men.
Kurofuji left in a palanquin!
Kurofuji entered Kikui's house.
Two palanquins left Kikui's.
-Kurofuji and Kikui.
-Where to?
They entered Takebayashi's place.
Three palanquins left Takebayashi's. They went west.
-Kurofuji's villa is there.
-That's the place. Let's go!
Wait. It will be bad  if they see you.
But there's only one guard for each palanquin.
It looks like atrick. We could capture them easily.
-Good idea!
-Then make them confess.
Fool! Don't you think it sounds too easy?
-Bait looks easy to get.
-But,
if it's really a chance, don't miss it.
We'll follow them, and attack them, if possible.
-Do you agree?
-Not a good idea,
but it may keep me awake.
-Are they all there? -Nothing suspicious about the palanquins?
-You can't tell.
-No guards concealed? -None atall.
-Let's attack.
-Before they enter the villa!
Wait.
I think you'd better stop.
-Wait! There's something wrong.
-Be quiet!
Go ahead, then. Who cares?
Let's go!
Pardon me.
Aren't these the palanquins of our senior clansmen?
We learned today
of the Chamberlain's misbehavior.
With so few guards,
you seem to need help.
We're ready to help you.
Drop your weapons!
You're under arrest!
Don't pretend you're not the Chamberlain's men!
The Chamberlain's men? Ridiculous!
No excuses! It was the Superintendent's trick.
-You followed the palanquins!
-Wait.
You disgust me. Stupidity is dangerous.
But how?
I happened to sneeze, and the lady heard me.
She released me.
-Wearing my best kimono! -She let me wear it.
Why didn't you escape?
I couldn't, since the lady trusted me completely.
And your story is contrary to what I wastold.
Good lesson.
Excuse me.
The lady is naive in every sense of the word.
She's stupid, that's all.
You mean the horsemen weren't the conspirators?
That's right.
We released them, but they refused to go.
They even suspect us and want our explanation.
Trapped by your own little tricks!
-You made more enemies instead.
-No.
They came to guard us in the first place.
If we explain about the decoy palanquins...
They're all very strong.
-They'll gladly help us.
-Good.
Rope them in and send them here.
That's not like you.
It'll show we're here.
Why not?
It's about time for a showdown.
The finale is close.
Judging from what the horsemen said,
the clansmen are on their side.
We're mice in a trap.
We have no chance.
Live or die,the nine of us are together.
Ten.
I'll go to Kikui.
-What for?
-A job.
Muroto kindly offered me one.
-Where to?
-We'll follow him.
He might betray us.
If so, why did he say he'd go to Kikui?
-He went to check his house.
-I think so, too.
Quiet!
-He'll never betray us.
But what he said worries me.
No. That's the way he talks.
-It's true.
-You can't tell what he'll do.
A monster!
-Who are you?
-I want Muroto.
He's busy!
Welcome! I've been waiting for you.
But I hear you're busy. I'll come again.
Never mind. Come in.
I trust him!
How many times did he save us?
People change!
He thinks it's time to leave us.
He has to worry about himself.
If he turns us in, he'll be employed.
No! He's poor, but a respectable samurai!
-He beat Kikui's men easily.
-Quiet!
He begged for money. A samurai starves before he begs.
-He's just open and a little eccentric.
-I trust him!
-He's a good man, I'm sure! -
You're the lady's kin.
You trust everyone!
Mother sent me to ask you
why you were shouting.
Nothing.
-But...
-Nothing!
Excuse me.
I was listening in the closet.
-Get back!
-In a moment.
I trust that samurai, too. Listen.
I may sound strange, but... When the lady climbed the wall,
he offered to be her footstool.
Her character impressed him. It shows he's a good man.
Nonsense! He said she's stupid.
As someone said, that's the way he talks.
He means praise by abuse.
-Understand?
-No! I don't!
No more talk.We'll follow him. He's dangerous.
Wait. Don't split up. One-sided judgment isn't fair.
If you go, we'll go two from each side...
Yasukawa and Kawahara, Izaka and Hirose.
