We can't come to the phone rightnow.
Please leave a message.
Hi, it's Jack. We're going
to leave London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport
so don'tpick us up.
Eight! One, two, three ...
You already own that.
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
Feed them if they're still alive.
Mom can make my move.
lf they're not, go to the store
and find a couple the same size.
We'll see you soon. Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- No! Another hotel?
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1 ,100.
l haven't got it. l'm out.
l want to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in.
My wife ... l guess.
Candles, champagne ...
- l'm sor´ry l didn't think of this.
- lt's okay, only one of us had to.
ls she asleep?
- What about your speech?
- l'll wing it.
Are you sure?
We have all watched in awe at
the events taking place in Moscow.
And at the enormous changes
resulting from these events.
ln this volatile climate,
we can only speculate -
- on the future
of Soviet Fleet development.
l would like to thank the Royal Navy
for inviting me here today.
He's impressed, but he can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.
Come on, we've got to meet Daddy.
l'm impressed.
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, we're here.
When we get to this street,
we turn left ... no, right.
Are you sure?
Okay, we're going to turn right.
Mind yourself, Paddyboy.
Move sure and fast.
- You've told me that.
- l'm telling you again.
This won't be like anything
you've done before, little brother.
Targetleaving the palace now.
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.
There's Daddy.
Go!
Get down!
Get down!
Get down. Keep her down.
Get out of the car! Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Open it or l'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go.
Go! Go!
Paddy?.
Stop! Army! Drop it!
What about the boy?.
He's had it.
lt's all right, sweetie. Stay here.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband. l'm a doctor.
Jesus! What were you thinking of?
l'm going to set you down.
Stay with me, Jack. You hear me?
Jack ... Stay with me.
There's a feeling of outrage over
this attack on the Royal Family.
No group has yet claimed credit,
but one is under strong scrutiny.
The lRA.
According to eyewitness accounts,
Lord William Holmes, -
- the MinisterforNorthern lreland,
along with his wife and son, -
- were saved by an American tourist,
John Patrick Ryan.
An author andprofessor at the
NavalAcademy in Maryland, -
- Ryan is
a former Marine Lieutenant.
He was wounded and is underguard
at an undisclosed London hospital.
Deborah Weston,
CNN News, London.
- l'm sor´ry.
- lt's all right.
You're alive. l forgive you.
otherwise ...
Hey, pumpkin.
l love you.
l love you, too.
Can you dignify their cowardice
with your silence? They left you.
They drove off without you.
What is it you think you owe them?
lf any of my mates
left me in your hands, -
- l'd feel no great sense
of loyalty. l'd kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?.
The trip was unscheduled, but you
knew Lord Holmes would be there.
l can't help you
if you don't talk to me.
l'd tear your heart out
if l didn't know you'd enjoy it.
You Fenian bastard.
No, not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.
Not Sean Miller. Not while
his brother's lying on a slab.
- Don't you believe it, Jimmy?.
- l don't believe the entire thing.
The Royal Family,
that only turns people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
The brigade know you were behind it.
Fuck the lRA! All these years of war
and they've got us nowhere.
England is still a monarchy,
and that is where we must strike.
The Royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us
or you're against us.
- Make up your mind.
- l'm with you.
Good, that's all l wanted to hear.
l'll leave you to it.
Kevin. Charlie's going to drop by
to straighten things out.
Be smart. Talk to him
and hold your temper.
l promise. Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, it's Charlie.
That's me holding my temper.
- Damn! l forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
You're not going to make me wear
a rubber?.
- The church says it's a sin, darling.
- So's this, darling.
What can you tell me about this guy?.
He's a nice boy. Sean Miller.
He shot a priest in Der´ry.
lt was during confession. He thought
he was informing for the British.
lt's not in Mr Ryan's best
interests, nor the prosecution's, -
- to discuss matters
not directly at hand.
lf you can confirm for me that you
disarmed that man in the square, -
- we'll be through.
- l can.
- Do you have anything to add?
Yes. The man l killed
was Miller's ... brother.
Patrick ... not even 1 7. He was
recruited by Sean into the lRA.
T´ry to preserve the clarity
of your eventual testimony.
- l read it in a newspaper.
- Refrain from reading newspapers.
Not even Doonesbury?.
Do you have anything to add?
No.
My name's Geoffrey Watkins.
Private secreta´ry to Lord Holmes.
lt's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.
Dr Ryan, how is your patient?
Just fine, we're looking forward
to going home, though.
- May l introduce his lordship?
- Hello.
lt's my great honour
to finally meet you.
l owe you a debt of gratitude
that l shall never be able to repay.
l'm delighted you're here
to share in the good news, Mrs Ryan.
Her Majesty has decided to invest
your husband with a knighthood.
My congratulations ... Sir.
Good luck today.
Sir Jack!
Lady Catherine!
lf l'd had time to think, l'd have
preferred to do something else.
You're saying you didn't have time,
so you didn't?
- Didn't what?
- You didn't think. lsn't that it?
No, you raced into a situation
of which you had no understanding -
- and attacked my client, who was
a pedestrian also hur´rying to help.
- Wearing a ski mask?.
- You shot another man in the chest.
- After they shot me.
- And felled a second victim.
l used that force
l deemed necessa´ry.
l should say so. l doubt ve´ry much
if anyone would disagree.
l didn't make this happen ...
He did.
There is one more question.
Are you still in the paid service
of the ClA?
Remember you're under oath.
- No.
- l beg your pardon?
No!
That's all, thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Bloody proud of yourself,
aren't you?
You stuck your nose in, and
now you've killed my baby brother.
Hey, Daddy.
Wow, you guys have really grown.
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Are you tired?
- No.
- l have no idea what time it is.
- You're telling me.
- Did l miss something?
- No ... but l did.
l'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can l watch some TV?
l'm not at all tired.
What?
Plates.
- Do l have any say in this?
- Sure, this is a family.
- Eve´ryone has a say.
- But my say is after the fact.
- Or am l wrong?
- No, you're right.
Michaela despises her little sister.
Well, it could be even worse.
lt could be a baby brother.
Oh no! Boys!
Jack.
Are you denying
that the lRA was behind this action?
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.
That's theirpolicy.
They'llproudlysay they did it.
Have the lRA admitted to this?
l mean, common sense, logic ...
Can l at least suggest some names?
Sure you can.
Good morning, Mr Cooley.
And to you. How's business?
Fine, thank you. l came upon this
first edition at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When would you want this by?.
- Soon.
The binder
may have some trouble with this.
ls that so?
l'll see what l can do.
He's not a miracle worker.
No, obviously he's not, Mr Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Good day, Mr Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean, do you mind
if l come along with you?
Although l disapprove
of the things you've done, -
- l can't quite bring myself
to condemn you.
l can't, because l understand
where the hatred comes from.
l more than understand it.
But the fact is, we're ve´ry near the
darkest hole in all of Great Britain, -
- and you still won't speak to me.
The bridge is up.
We'llbe here forfive minutes.
Understood.
Mobile three to Lymington ...
Open the door.
Open it or l'll kill him.
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- Open the door.
Should we wait until they kill him
and then open the door?.
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Get them out.
Lie down. Don't you fucking move.
Did you think we'd forget about you?
lnspector Robert Highland,
this is a friend of mine.
Tell me, what do they pay you
to turn against your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Ve´ry well,
if that's the way you feel about it.
Come on, Cath.
- Have l got the tickets?
- They're on the fridge!
- Dad ...
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Jack, you know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?.
- Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
They were moving him to
Albany Prison on the lsle of Wight.
- We think he's left the count´ry.
- Let's deal in what we know.
We know he escaped in Kent,
near the Channel.
lf he's left the count´ry ...
Jack, are you listening?
The chances that he'd come here,
or would t´ry to, -
- are so remote
l have trouble even saying it.
Yet your first instinct
was to come out here and tell me.
Marty, excuse us a few minutes.
l've got a few more weeks
before school starts, -
- but l've got to prepare
a few lectures.
Come and look at what we've got.
You might turn up something.
You're asking me
if l want to come back.
Yep.
We'll t´ry and go next week.
Sor´ry.
Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They thought l might be concerned,
but l'm not.
The lRA's not going to follow me
over here. We talked about that.
They're gone, that's it.
They didn't ask you
to come back to ClA?
- l said no.
- Just like that.
l don't want to go back.
- l saw them coming and l just ...
- l know.
l can't go back to that life again,
you know?.
l bet your cell
was better than this.
At least you had
your own toilet bowl.
Cheer up, you've just been spared
a lifetime of hell on earth.
l don't feel like resting, laying in
the sun like a complacent tourist.
We've got to train like soldiers
and we can't do that in lreland.
lt's a waste of time.
There's a difference
between laying about and laying low.
Next time we'll post Lord Holmes
back to Whitehall in pieces, -
- if that's what it takes to free
eve´ry lrish political prisoner.
- That's not what l'm thinking of.
- l know that.
What Ryan did can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
l can't.
How could something like this
have happened?
lnspector Highland picked the day
and the route, and still they knew.
- He had two children.
- Tragic.
SO-13 have narrowed it down to
Five of whom are now dead.
You should limit your appointments.
l will not have my itinera´ry
dictated to me by terrorists.
Whoever this traitor is,
they'd better pray l never find him.
We know you'll do your best, sir.
We don't know
ifwe're ever coming home
stand up, buckle up,
shuffle through the door
jump out and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens
on what basis, on what grounds?
Mr Viederman?
A bad time for you?
They said they'd be grateful.
- Didn't they?.
- Yeah.
''Fight our battle and the world
will fear and respect you.''
- Athens already had respect.
- lt didn't matter.
- Pride, sir.
- That's the real battle.
- Attention on deck.
- Attention to orders.
l have a presentation to make.
For service above and beyond
the call of duty of a tourist, -
- we recognise John Patrick Ryan
with the order of the Purple Target.
We hope that he will duck
next time, -
- lest he become part of histo´ry
rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
Plate-glass window?.
Here goes. Hi, guys.
We may have to bump my next
appointment. This might take time.
Yes, let's bump it.
Okay, let's do it.
You just waded on in
like John Wayne.
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?
- l don't know. l wasn't thinking.
- You sound like my students.
lt pissed me off.
l couldn't just stand there
and watch them shoot those people.
lt was ... rage.
Pure rage.
- lt just made me mad.
- l hope you never get mad at me.
She's late, Sean.
She was at this dance,
and then this guy at the end ...
She's kind of cute, isn't she?
ls she?
Bye.
- Hi, Mommy.
- How are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 50. West.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Dr Ryan! He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?.
Dr Catherine Ryan, please.
How long?
Come on!
This is Dr Ryan. l want the results
on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.
Cathy, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom.
- lt's beautiful.
l'm still holding.
l'd like to speak with Dr Sutton.
Operator, emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.
lt's a mobile phone, l know.
What do you mean l can't?
Faster!
- Dr Ryan, the scan is fine.
- Great, thank you.
Jesus!
Hello? Jack?.
Cath, something's happened.
ls Sally with you?
- ls everything all right?
- Fine.
There she is.
Get to the nearest police station
as quick as you can.
- The police station?
- Get offthe highway.
Steady, mate.
- Where are you now?
- Rowe Boulevard.
There's a police station
at Houston Street.
- ls something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone.
- Mr Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's okay.
- And my daughter?.
- Let's sit down.
No, talk to me.
lt's going to be a while
before we know.
- Where's Sally?.
- She's in the recove´ry room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in a few hours.
They had to remove her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
l'm sor´ry.
Here you go. Are you okay?.
We go over to our reporter
with Paddy O'Neil.
l'm praying for the recovery ofthe
victims ofthis senseless attack.
Sinn Féin are outraged, as are most
lrishmen, at this heinous crime.
l want to share with Dr Ryan
our empathy and anguish, -
- at an appropriate time.
- Was funding for the lRA ...
- The lRA are notresponsible here.
- Theyhad nothing to do with it?
- No more questions.
- She's going to be okay.
- Thank you.
lt's all right. She's fine.
Mr Ryan?
l'd like to share with you
our deep regret ...
Mr Ryan ...
You know the deal. You are involved.
lt's not good process.
The victim of a crime
does not make the best analysis, -
- even if
you knew something about terrorism.
l have guys on it
who know about the lRA.
l'm not standing here with my hat
in my hand. l want back in.
Jack ...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and l are so relieved.
- Have you managed any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
l'm interrupting something.
You were telling Jack that we'd
be better off without him around.
Or something along those lines.
Marc Spiva. Jack Ryan.
Tony Ferro. Alex Winter.
- Rose ...
- You look better than l expected.
- lt's an illusion.
- lt'd have to be. Good to see you.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night-table reading.
''Father killed by RUC ...
Belfast, 1979.''
Good morning, sir.
Could l see some identification?
- Did you see the game?
- Yeah, it was all right.
For that penalty,
he was outside the area.
- What the hell ..?
- Nobody move!
Get 'em up!
Good morning.
Kevin O'Donnell.
A long-time lRA strategist.
He saw Timothy Miller die in 1979.
He looked after Sean and Patrick.
lt's a recent photo.
lf we could find O'Donnell,
we'd find Miller, too.
- Are you with me, Jack?.
- l'm just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- lt wasn't registered.
- Son of a bitch.
- What?
Look ...
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip
about some bomb-making setup.
They get the bad guys,
but who tipped them off?
Three lRA hitmen
found dead at a farmhouse.
That's British soldiers
getting out of hand.
No, look ... Brigade Commander
Jimmy O'Reardon.
Ends up dead in a cheap hotel.
A professional hit.
- Was that after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day.
- What are you coming to?
Jack! Where are you going?
l'm going to throw
some water on my face.
Excuse me ...
l think one of us
is in the wrong room.
lt's okay.
- Jack!
- Get down.
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.
Get down!
Who are we looking for here,
lRA terrorists?
Or some ultra-violent faction
of the lRA, fighting their own way.
O'Reardon checked into an hotel
with a woman with long hair.
Long red hair.
This is who we're looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.
l saw his wife and daughter die,
but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead.
- What?
They survived it.
l can't say it any plainer.
- lt doesn't matter now.
- lt does matter.
Americans hold their breath
eve´ry time a little girl falls down.
You shot at one with a machine gun
on her way back from school.
We've started the war. The Brits are
tearing apart Belfast for the lRA.
Their American money, by denying the
hits, makes them look more guilty.
The war is raging. When it's over,
we'll be the ones left standing.
l let you go for Paddyboy,
but that's it!
We've got work to do ...
and it's not in Ma´ryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
lt's easy to get at them.
You should
look afteryour familybetter.
Are you there? l understand
your little girl's feeling better.
Losing herspleen willmake it
tough on her to fight offinfection.
You sick son of a bitch.
lt was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
All he can do is call up.
You get him, Jack.
l don't care what you have to do.
Just get him!
Can l buy you a drink?.
No ...
Let me buy you one.
Two whiskeys.
The lRA's not responsible
for all this, l know that.
Are you waiting for me to agree?
lt's what l've said all along.
You claim responsibility
for one thing, deny it for another.
Nobody believes you anymore.
l want to know where Sean Miller
and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me t´ry and understand this ...
You want me to sell out
my fellow lrishmen to you?
- You don't understand me at all.
- l think l do.
l don't care what they've done!
The day l sell out my own people,
l'll put a bullet through my head.
- That's it then.
- Yes, l'm not drinking with you.
Okay, l'll go home.
l'll call the Press and let them
film in my daughter's hospital room.
lt'll be on the evening news.
l don't care if it wasn't you,
and neither will anyone else.
You'll have so little gun money,
you'll all be out throwing rocks.
l will fucking destroy you!
l'll make it my mission in life.
Excuse me.
Well, lads, did you hear that?
- The satellite's coming.
- Let's go.
Come on!
Get inside!
SO-13 traced the guns
used in the Lord Holmes incident -
- to an arms dealer
that supplies Gaddafi.
Sean Miller was last seen in a
Zodiac heading out into the Channel.
l checked on the freighters
that were out there that day.
Syrian regist´ry. lnvolved
in the Middle East arms trade.
- Miller sailed to North Africa.
- Exactly.
Our planes photograph 182 camps
a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action Direct, Red Army Faction ...
But on the day
this ship docked in Benghazi, -
- there's activity
in only nine of these camps.
One is PLO, one Shining Path,
these seven we're not so sure about.
- Why?.
- Our satellites ...
The people in those camps probably
know our satellite schedules.
Marty, unless you authorise us
to retask those satellites, -
- so we can get a look in, -
- we're never going to know
which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal
it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
That's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that? Tighten up on that.
Can you enhance that?
Tits.
The SAS could take out
any one of these camps.
Kill eve´rybody there,
and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure this is the same woman?
Keep at it then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
''The sun did not shine,
it was too wet to play.''
''So we sat in the house
all that cold, wet day.''
''l sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.''
''l wish we had something to do.''
''Too wet to go out.
Too cold to playball. ''
''So we satin the house
and did nothing at all. ''
''All we could do
was to sit, sit, sit. ''
''We did notlike it,
not one little bit. ''
''And then something went... bump. ''
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
He probably enjoys the irony.
She's not lrish, she's English.
This is the girl you saw
in the jeep, in the blink of an eye?
- Yeah.
- What am l supposed to do?
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Give them her picture.
Ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?
You walk into a bar, half of whose
customers want you dead.
You walk up to the lRA's bagman
and publicly threaten him.
You're not a field man.
You are an analyst. Analyse that!
l am not after yourjob. l'm after
the man who tried to kill my family.
Well then, think. lf you tell O'Neil
that you're looking for a girl, -
- and he gives you pictures of
a girl. Do you believe him?
l didn't tell him
l was looking for a girl.
Sarge, come and look at this.
l'm a bit of a bookworm, not that
you'd know it to look at me.
What's your passion then?
Mysteries? Spy novels?
- This is a rare book shop.
- Rare? Yes, so they are.
- Can you locate the problem?
- l already have.
The wiring in this place
dates from before the war.
lt's what we call
in the electrical business ... rare.
- l can fix it, but can you afford it?
- Just fix it.
- He's seen it, hasn't he?
- l don't know.
- He's got it.
- What do you make of this?
l ...
l have no idea!
Damn!
l have to go out for a few minutes
to deliver some books.
- Keep about your repairs.
- l'll be here all week.
He gave me the hat.
He said, ''This is for you, my dear.''
Damn!
Dinner at the White House
is no problem.
- What is the problem?
- We're running out of dates.
We could move that to there ...
Which would leave us the 14th.
Check with John Ryan
about a presentation -
- at our embassy in Washington
on the ...
... 14th.
Let's go over this again.
We start in Washington ...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- l'm trying to reach Mr Titus.
- ls that extension 2691?
- No, this is 2619.
l'm terribly sor´ry.
- What are you doing up?
- l want to be there when she wakes.
l'll go with you
and take a cab back.
Hello ... Yes, just a minute.
- lt's for you, Sir John.
- Hello?
Mr Ryan is holding a celebration.
Would you care to join them?
- Where? At his house?
- Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this
eight days ago in Berlin.
One, two, three ...
Four Brits travelling with him.
Light arms.
- The heavy stuff is in the cars.
- He's German.
- ls this boring you, Sean?
- Six altogether.
- lt'll be the same in Washington.
- Holmes will always be protected.
Four days in Washington
and one day in New York ...
... shopping.
Yeah, two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn. A new arrival.
What do you think, same guy?.
The rare-book dealer, Dennis Cooley.
He's bald.
lt's possible there's a woman
in some of these camps.
But with her and Cooley
in the same place ...
... if that is Cooley, the odds
of coincidence are dropping fast.
But still,
there's no way l can be ...
... absolutely certain.
Jack, tell me one thing in life
that is absolutely certain.
My daughter's love.
What l need is your best guess,
and l think l've heard it.
Haven't l?
The bastards took away
my book shop and my books.
l'm sor´ry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.
- This mission will be ve´ry messy.
- l can fire a gun.
Sor´ry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?.
- lt's you who have taken us, Jack.
lnto battle.
Airborne support in target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.
SAS team on the ground.
Enlarge camp 18.
