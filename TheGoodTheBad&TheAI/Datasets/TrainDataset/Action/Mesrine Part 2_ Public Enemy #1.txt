Public Enemy Nbr. 1: Epilogue
PARIS: Porte de Clignancourt
September 2nd 1979
!
- Sir, Inspector, only one question...
- There's nothing that will help him.
- How many of you were there?
- Maybe 30, not more.
- How long have you been following them for?
- You know all details...
- I'll inform you about everything.
- Couldn't you make the mistake?
No, I absolutly disagree.
- Did the operation go without any complications?
- Yes. Two teams worked on it,
detectives and guys from command center.
One last question...
Open the doors. We've seen him to carry the weapons.
He had two grenades.
We fired a warning shots...
He didn't want to give it up. We had no other choice.
We would lose him if he managed
to get to the circle.
Jojo! Bring the stretchers!
We already seen everything important. Let's go.
Hold on.
Year 1973...
...thursday...
...eight...
...of march.
Testimony...
... of Mesrin, Jacques.
Hey, you clown.
What do you think would break first, handcuffs or radiator?
My last name is Merine not Mesrine!
Like the name  "Miromesnil", it is with "s"
but you don't pronounce it.
That's enough Mesrine!
Let's talk about your friend,
- Grangier Ardouin.
- I don't know him.
Seriously, I don't know him.
- Mister Jacques. Welcome.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Looks like you gained a few.
- Are you crazy? I'm on diet for last three months.
- Really? Let me see.
- You see?
- Armed to the teeth.
- Yeah, like it's supposed to be.
Clear.
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Come on, one more right here.
On the floor! All of you on the floor!
On the floor!
Nobody moves! Lie down!
I said don't move!
Put all money in the bag! Hurry up!
Everybody stays down!
Hurry! Hurry!   Let's go!
- Good girl.
- We're outta here! We're outta here!
The bank teller...  ok she recognized me...
sure, because i didn't have a mask on... so?
- She identified your accomplice too.
- I don't give a shit.
First, i don't know any of them and secondly,
my buddies always wear masks.
Maybe she eats too many carrots.
We caught you too easy.
Freeze! Don't move!
Hold him!
- You're confessing to the robbery and the murder attempt.
- Yes,  I am.
- but you are not confessing to the kidnapping.
- Why should I admit something
that I haven't done.
It's completly logical I won't admit
something I haven't done.
We'll take you to the court in Compiegne.
You'll be locked up...  for a very long time.
In three months I won't be there.
You wanna bet?
- What again?
- I have to go to bathroom.
- Hold it.
- I am sick! Am i supposed to shit my pants in front of judge?
- Mesrine, move.
- Sure.
Am i going to wipe my ass with my foot or what?
Hold on.
Now you can.
And what about you? What do you want? Are you gay or you want to smell
my shit?  Let me shit!
Am I supposed to shit right here?
Loosen up the cuffs. I won't run.
Ahh, what a relief.
Hurry!
Now i feel better.
Mister Mesrine, stand here...
Your honor,  by the law i shouldn't
have the handcuffs on me.
It's the violation of my rights.
It's sounds very funny when
you talk about the law.
- For your defense you won't need to use your hands.
- Your honor...!
Enough! That's enough Mesrine!
Everyone on the ground! Let's go!
Unlock my handcuffs! Hurry!
Fat ass next to the wall, let's go!
Nobody moves!
Get out of there!
Stay on the floor!
You get up! Move!
On the floor!
Hands up! On the floor!
Everybody with your face to the floor!
Let's go!
Quickly after him!
This won't help your case, Mesrine.
- Don't shoot!
- Stay over there!
Put the gun down! Move!
- Hurry or i kill him!
- Easy, take it easy.
All of you back off!
- get out of here!
- move, go after him!
Go! Go!
- Why did you let the judge go?
- Move!
Go faster!
- Jacques!
- Watch out!
Hand me the gun.
Back up or i'll shoot!
I said BACK UP!
I'll kill you, you moron!
Good bye, good luck!
Robert caught a bullet.
Can you take it out?
I don't know, I have to take a look.
Here.
- Jacques, I have a news from your family.
- What news?
Your father is sick...
Come, I'll take a look.
Shit!
Jacques Mesrine may have not commited
his most serious crime ever, yesterday,
After being arrested in march of this year,
Mesrine said he doesn't agree with the sentence.
When they arrived he asked the guards a permission
to go to the bathroom.
He knew his accomplices hid the gun
in a toilet
without being noticed by the guards.
They didn't even realized and Jacques Mesrine was armed.
- That's lie! I've never said that.
that Jacques Mesrine must be considered as "The Public Enemy
number 1"
Number 1. Number 1!
Hello.
Dad. Dad it's me. Can you see?
It's me Jacques.
- Jacques.
- How do you feel? - You came...
I thought i'll  pay you a little visit
since all banks are closed.
Fool.
- You came... Have you seen your daughter yet?
- No, not yet.
I wasn't the best son,
but my father was proud of me.
That's the way i was born. Forgive me.
That's the way i am.
- It's my fault.
- No, no.
What ever happens you always
will be her father.
I know.
Like you always will be my son.
Yes.
Forgive me, please forgive me.
- I think you should go.
- Yes, i will.
Except children, mother and friends
no one else is here.
He is not such an idiot to come here.
- What"s that? Remembrance from the fight?
- No, it's from boxing.
Oh, so you're a boxer.
Michel is a boxer too.
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yeah.
We're planning a small job.
Are you interested?
Stolen car have been reported.
It is a silver Renault 16,
license plate number is 7791YL75.
- We spotted the reported vehicle.
Unit... we got the car.
Shit!
The street is not an ashtray, sir.
We'll have to give you a fine.
Get out of the car and show us
your papers, please.
I'm waiting. Get out of the car!
Don't resist! Put the hands behind your back!
Quickly!
Shit.
Move out of my way.
Stop! Stop!
Get out of the car!
Open the door! Hurry!
Get out!
Don't move!
Go already!
Fast!
Step on it!
Faster! Faster!
Go!
Let's leave!
Out of way!
Come on, train is here!
Move! Quick! Jump in!
Nobody moves!
Shut up! Sit down!
Shit!
Who are you starring at? Stare at floor!
I knew he'd fuck it up. He's an asshole!
They almost got us because of him!
You're always the smartest one and i'm an idiot.
And now leave me alone!
Alone? What are you talking about?! Cops got him!
Now that moron is blabbing to them!
Listen to me! I only choose those
who knows how to keep their mouth shut.
Go fuck yourself!
Always!
If you're so sure about it
then you'll have to do it without me.
I'm done Mesrin!
- Then just leave!
- I'm gone!
You get out of here too!
Come on! Get out!
Inspector Broussard!
- Are we going to wait any longer?
- I'll let you know.
- My guys are on the roof for 8 hours already and it's raining.
- I see. We have a plenty of time.
Moron.
Open! The police.
The Police! The building is surrounded!
The police! Open up!
- The house is surrounded!
- What? What's going on?
- Who is it? What do you want from me?
- Open or we kick the door!
Go fuck yourselves!
I belong to Baader's!
I'll blow it all up!
Long live revolution!
Quickly, get dressed! Move yourself!
Of course...
Danke schon.
That's enough Jacques, you lost.
- Who do you think you are talking to me like that?
- Robert Broussard, police inspector.
Aha, Broussard, the one with the moustache like a sailor.
All newspapers write about you.
Exactly.
- Let's end this circus. Give up!
- I don't care!
How can I trust you?
Slip your identity card through the door so I can see it.
- So you could shoot me?
- Or you me, when i try to pick it up?
You're right.
So then what? I'm giving you my word,
you can trust me.
I won't fire.
Come on Broussard, don't hesitate.
- Ok Jacques.
- I'm waiting.
Catch.
So what?
- Broussard?
- yes?
- I have two requirements.
- I hope they're reasonable...
First one is that you won't touch the girl who's
here with me.
And second one, I need 20 minutes to get
something in the order.
Do you have any other wish?
Would you like a car with a driver?
If I want to maybe that too.
You are not in position to negotiate, Broussard.
So? I'm waiting!
So what is it!
You got 20 minutes, Jacques. 20 minutes!
Jacques, what should i do?
Answer me, Jacques.
Can i help you with something?
- What are they going to do with me?
- Bring me the matches from the table.
- I'm scared.
- Bring the matches!
Here you go.
They'll arrest me. You think they put me in jail?
I don't want to go to jail...
- Calm down. Easy.
- How can i calm down, they will...
Calm down!
Are you finished? Are you calm?
- What will they do with me?
- Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Just easy, quiet...
What are you waiting for, Mesrine?
What are you trying to do over there?
We gave you 20 minutes not 40.
Broussard, are you brave enough to come in here without a gun
and bulletproof vest?
- Why is that?
- I want to know, if you can do it.
So, are you coming in or are you scared?
Hey! Broussard?
Well, ok then.
See? I took the vest down and put gun away.
And what about you?
Do you have a courage to come out without the gun?
As you can see, I do.
Hey you the artist, take a picture of us together.
The big glory moment of Inspector Broussard!
If you insist.
Didn't you wonder why i didn't kill you and your buddies?
We cops do not wonder, but we act.
Just because the woman was here.
Just because of that... that she was here.
Next time there won't be a woman nor chapaigne.
Just two of us.
To our next meeting.
Prison de la Santé
Paris, 1973.
Guard!
Guard!
- What do you need Jacques?
- What kind of guy is he, that Pinochet?
- He's Chilean general.
- The general in Chile?
The whole page about some Pinochet
but no a word about me!
- There was a coup.
- A coup? Bring me the typewriter.
- I want to write something!
- Alright, I try.
Go!
Pinochet. Pinochet!
" DEATH INSTINCT"
What do you think it is?
- This is my book.
- This is not a book, it is the death sentence.
You have a trial in two months and you're publishing a book in which
you're confessing to committing 40 murders.
At this moment all cops in France are studying your book.
And after they finish, they use everything from your
memoirs in a indictment against you.
- Well in that case they have to be retarded.
- What do you mean?
- This is not the truth?
- Audience loves the  plot, the action...
- And?
- And i don't think that jurry will believe
that i am such an idiot, that would confess to something
that would put me on gilotene.
And in the eyes of the nation I'm a Star.
You entertain the nation but at the same time you horrify it.
And as far as they can push the fear by not letting you go free,
they won't.
So middle-class, such a funny honest word.
They allowed you a visit.
- I grew up.
- I see.
- I cannot notice.
- I'm not a child anymore.
- You really are beautiful.
- Thanks.
- And how are... your brothers?
- Boris and Bruno are doing fine,
they're acting like a fools otherwise nothing is new.
- That's weird.
- Yes.
- Didn't he ride his bike with some punks.
- Do you want play on a father...?
- I didn't come here to be lectured.
- Alright, just be careful.
- When you come back home?
- It won't be that soon.
Honey i'm sorry...  i'd rather to meet you
under different circumstances.
At least i know where i can always find you.
I miss you.
Jacques Merine, are you still denying
contact with Michele Ardouin?
I already said I don't know him.
I do not know him!
Michel Ardouin stand up so
Mesrine can see you better.
I'm telling you i don't know him.
I would remember that nose for sure.
Do you admit that you took chief judge as a hostage during your escape?
I've hid behind the justice
as any decent citizen would.
What's wrong about that?
Nothing, if your escape doesn't change to kidnaping.
Sir, in clothes from 101 dalmatians,
escape is everyone's bounden duty and the right,
and it is a business too,
and so i wouldn't just talk in the wind,
ladies and gentlemen, in my hand i have a key. Can you see?
And do you know what kind of key it is?
It is by a coincidence a key for my handcuffs.
Just look!
And do you know how did i get ahold of it?
I simply bought it from my guard
for a half million of old franks.
Sirs journalists, dear jury,
this is your system, which you and prosecutor
are so defending it.
We are honored by his presence.
inspector Broussard,
who's sitting right next to journalists.
Inspector! Look at it yourself.
I'm done.
Tell us Mr. Mesrine, why would you need such a big arsenal of weapons
we found at your place?
Your honor, how should i explain it...
Since i was a kid, this unexplainable
feeling of vulnerability is following me.
You should thank me...
I analyze murderers, i help cops,
i provide work for the doctors at the emergency rooms.
Before us we have a picture of nice looking man.
But he is a gangster,
who doesn't hurt any one,
he's even gentle to his victims...
All this is just a pretence,
a mask covering a bestial animal.
They don't exist good gangsters,
there are only gangsters and nothing more...
and before you is standing one.
Mersine, you start shooting without thinking,
when you see that situation is getting out of your hands.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear jury,
you're deciding today about the justice
and you will bring the sentence.
The society which doesn't punish criminals,
cannot be considered righteous.
So I am the public enemy nbr. 1?!
What?
This is all bullshit.
I am the enemy of the government, the banks,
yes, it is right and accurate to je pøesné a výstiné.
I steal from them, that's why they don't like me,
but when i steal from banks,
i don't feel like i'm breaking the law.
I'm stealing from a bigger thief.
Do you want to put me in jail,
throw out the key and forget about me?!
Go ahead, just stick me in there!
But remember what i said,
i'll run away from there. I promise you that!
The jury with eight votes
found guilty and sentenced...
Pierre Vondorin to 5 years
on probation.
Michel Grangier to 7 years
in prison.
Michel Ardouina to 10 years
in prison.
Accused Jacques Mesrine
to 20 years in prison with maximum security.
- Do you have a light?
- Sure I do, Mr. Jacques.
Thanks.
- Hi, Luc.
- Hey Jacques.
Hi.
Are you sweating on purpose or is this normal?
Could you at least answer me,
I am Jacques Mesrine.
So what?
What you doing in my yard?
Here, is not a custom to forbid anything from me.
Yeah , i've noticed.
- By the way, i have 3 escapes behind me.
- Me too.
Maybe...
...i'd like to try one more time.
- My name is François Besse.
- I know.
Control.
Control.
- It's ok boss,  a tin foil is inside.
- Allright
Mr. Jacques, your lawyer is here.
- Boss, i'm cold i want to go back to cell.
- In two minutes, first we'll take Jacques back .
Two minutes?
Hello.
- What's going on?
- It's about the story in Canada.
- But i don't have your manuscripts.
- Then let's get it right.
Boss! Boss!
- What do you want?
- I need my manuscripts,
i gave them to my neighbor.
- To Bess?
- Yeah.
Can you do me a favor and bring them here,
as fast as you can, please.
- Ok.
- Thanks chief.
If someone will get to know about this, nothing will help me.
- I'm done.
- Don't worry,
you are saving my life
and i won't be destroying yours.
- Will everything go smoothly?
- Already did.
Mesrine wants his manuscripts.
- We got a problem.
- Move back.
What's going on, why are you over here?

Shocking ending. The pursuing by Red brigades

Leader of Christian Democrats
paid by his life
for hideous intimidating by terrorists.
This threat could be avoided.
Anonymous caller noticed parked car
near to headquarters...
inside of which was found dead body
of man, Alda Mora.
- Where you been? You could say something.
- Jean-Luc, it's my honor and pleasure,
to introduce to you princess Annie
and princess Christiane.
- Good evening.
- My cousin Jean-Luc,
- as you can see, he's armed.
- Yeah.
Take a seat next to him and surround him
by your warm and charm.
You see, how  badly he needs it?
- Is it real?
- Take your hands off it!
- So, do we begin?
- Bruno, come here for a moment.
My princesses, excuse me for a moment.
Wait here, i'll be right back.
- What's up?
- What kind of whores are they?
- François, they're not whores.
- Then who are they?
They're two charming students,
who wants to have fun and we gonna help them with it.
We have to inform you that Public enemy
nbr. 1 is still free.
- Wait.
- What for?
- We don't have a time for this.
- François, sexual passion...
is natural human necessity.
- I didn't have a girl for 5 years...
- Do what i do, devote yourself to sport.
...two other prisoners ran away
with Mesrine,
one was shot and the other succeded
to escape.
Escapees are armed.
They managed to obtain the gun,
which helped them to remove all witnesses
during the jailbreak.
- François, don't spoil my plans.
- Go fuck yourself!
We're gonna go. Your friend doesn't
like our presence.
Wait, wait! Come to me!
François, shit, you frightened them.
Turn the tv on.
- Don't trust journalists, they babble nonsense.
- I think i'll take a walk.
Come on, again? François! François!
- That was you on tv, wasn't it?
- You know the answer.
- Jacques Mesrine.
- No, Merine.
Jacques Merine.
- Nice to meet you.
- Jacques Merine, nice to meet you too.
Police inspector Vaugier and
divisional inspector Lerio.
- Hello.
- Hello.

- No, he isn't. I'm covering him today.
- Is always so many people here?
- You arrived from Paris
to find out how many people is here?
- Without comments, corporal.
- Tell me, how many of you are working here?
- Here, a few tens of employees.
- Well, what did i say? It's not that bad.
- Not at all. - No doubt.
- Why are you here?
- Obviously you know,
that your cutthroats escaped from prison.
Did you hear any gossip about their plans?
- It's about Besse and Mesrine.
- No, i didn't. And you think they could come here?
You never know with these guys, corporal.
Be careful, especially the shorter one,
because he is very dangerous.
- Sure.
- Sure...
Henry, we should be on our way.
We have a lot of work to do. Thank you, corporal.
What we can do.
See you later.
We thought there will be like 5 of them
but they have the whole regimnet there.
Don't whine! Even if they had a whole army in there
you would act like a chicken.
See you.
- Are you talking about counterfeit money?
- Yes, exactly.
And you'd probably like to check my safe.
That would be nice.
Do you have a court order?
No no, please.
The court order.
- Court order.
- Yes.
He's right. Do you have a warrant, inspector?
I have it...
I have a brilliant order, clearly it is a metal one.

We change the clothes...

continued the whole night,
despite the effort of the dogs,
helicopters and armed forces,
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hello.

So, Isabelle? Where's my gift?
- Thanks.
- Can we begin?
Be brave Isabelle, get on me.
Why are you doing this?
Because i don't like the laws.
i don't like the laws and i don't want
to be a slave of the alarm clock the whole my life.
I don't want the whole my life just to dream.
I don't want always to think,
how i have to work a half year,
so i could buy some thing.
- No. No!
- What do you expect from the life?
-Recognition? Money?
- Money, Money! All of you...
just keep talking abot them, always the same.
But i'm completely different.
What exactly am i doing?
I'm looking for the money in the places where they are, that means in the banks.
Regarding the politics,
are you on the left or the right?
Neither side. I think politics are dirty game
it's better to keep the distance from it.
I don't trust any politician.
- Do you consider yourself as a dangerous individual?
- Dangerous... And according to you?
I don't know, maybe i'm dangerous. I don't know.
Why are you asking?
Depends to whom.
For instance i don't play with cops...
Shoot it!
Good photograph, publish it!
Dangerous...
Probably yes. I'm probably dangerous.
- What kind of old age and death will you have?
- Old age. Honestly, i don't think i'll live that long.
One day they shoot me to death, it completly makes sense.
Natural.
After all for some one who was in prison with maximum security,
there are no rules.
- Like me, i live without rules.
- Without rules and without hope?
- Do you have any plans?
- I've got a lot of plans. Plans...
Close the prison with maximum security.
I lived there for 5 years.
Can you imagine? The whole 5 years!
i want all of those who sit there to let go!
I've seen over there, how they break people,
how they destroy them.
But our Mr. Minister, Alain Perfite
he didn't get it yet,
i am an excellent shooter and i can kill a few judges.
Do we need in France gangs of Bordeleo?
Do we need Red brigades?
Let them ask themselves the question.
Because if there will be need to go in their neighborhoods,
to train with Palestinians, I'll go!
They can shit their pants!
- Do you want something to drink? Coffee?
- with delight. - Sugar?
- Jacques Merine.
- Yes? - They write about you in "Match".
Not even a year have passed.
Today's menu, lamb legs.
I'm getting sick of these english meals.
"if there will be need to join Palestinian,
i'll come..."
"if there will be need , i'll start wave of violence
France never seen before".
- I said it and i will do it.
- "I'm the expert on explosives". Moron!
- Next?
- "...can kill a few judges"
- What kind of nonsense is this?!
- It's not a nonsense.
- It's a revolution.
- A what? - A revolution!
We are a criminals, not a revolutionists.
We are not going to destroy the system.
You see honey? This is typical
little cry baby.
Sam is short, his ideals are small.
I'm not overestimating my power
and i'm not calling for vendetta against the state.
- That's it!
- Yeah, that's it.
Well, i won't sign your magazine then.
You can wipe your ass with it.
- Please stop it. François, come to the table.
- I don't work like this.
Simple just know how to use media.
That's all.
- We have to talk.
- Anytime. But now come to the table.
I'm inviting you to the table of accused.
i have a great plan.
we kidnap a billionaire.
- What are we going to do?
- What kind of question is that? Think about it.
I tell you, the one i've chose
is a big fat cat.
Old fart is forcing people to live in rabbit holes.
It's a serious thing, you can trust me.
And then... You know what we gonna do then?
We'll buy the bazookas and we attack the prison.
Listen Jacques, we attack the prison,
again why not...
- And then? What else do you want to drag me in to?
- After all... - Besides you're not going ever stop.
You want to destroy this sytem
and on contrary i want to profit from it.
simply you're fool,
you don't realize the consequences.
- Fool? - Fool.
- What's this fool? I don't understand you at all.
- Hi, how are you? Is Mr. Leliévre at home?
- I'm his son. And you are?
Inspector Vaugier, police.
Can we go in?
- What's going on?
- Do you own a few houses for rent?
We'd like to talk about that.
Wait.
Thank you.
Two cops are here and they
want to talk to you.
- How can i be to use for you gentlemen?
- We received a complaint from...
a few renters of your apartments,
regarding a bad living conditions.
We ask you to come with us
to police station.
- Couldn't we to take care of it here?
- Please, how would it look like.
Well in that case let's go.
I hope it won't take too long.
- Tell Charlie, to get the car ready...
- That won't be necessary, we have a car.
- We can bring you back.
- Excellent, lets go then.
Thank you for understanding.
From now on you're in hands
of Palestine Liberation Organization.
What? Palestine?
And what's my connection with it?
We rent apartments in Paris and
i'm not a jew.
What's the difference?
- You will pay me. I'm Jacques Mesrine.
- Mesrine? - right.
How long am i gonna be here?
Depends on you.
If you reach deep in your pockets you can go home.
- How much do you need?
- 10 millions in cash.
- 10 millions?
- Yeah.
What are... 10 millions is too much.
I'll dissapoint you, but i'm 82 years old. I rather be killed.
- Then give us eight.
- No. - I didn't understand. - No.
Do you think we are morons, you old fart?
- Seven and we go separate ways for good!
- No!
- How much can you pay me then, you penny pincher?
- Six... in four payments.
Aha, in four payments?! In four!
So, you'll pay in three payments
and if you try to screw me,
i put the bullet in you, for free! Got it?
- Yes.
- Did you get it?
- Yes, i did.
Right word of obedient old man.
Excellent, realy good cognac.
We are not that different Mr. Mesrine.
We both like good things and to get them,
we have to steal from honest hard
working man. And why not?
What are you talking about? We've got nothing in common.
You are an exploiter and i'm a revolutionary.
It's not the same thing.
- Mr. Mesrine, what's the difference
between a revolutionary and gangster?
- What is it, a riddle?
A Revolutionary would already put a bullet in my head
and left my body in a trunk of some car,
in the meanwhile gangster needs a ransom,
he wants the money and then he let me go free.
Will you do it too?
You forgot the third option.
I'll take your money, put a bullet in your head
and i put you in a trunk.
- How about that?
- In that case, everything they write abou you in newspapers,
Mesrine is honorable gangster,
he stands behind his word, all of it is just crap.
- Jacques, look!
...accomplice of wanted Jacques Mesrine,
François Besse, with whom he escaped
from prison in De la Santé.
Mesrine...
After a few months Besse
parted ways with the Public enemy Nbr.1
Belgian police arrested Bessa
and his three accomplices not far from Brussels,
Belgian police...
- Only the biggest moron...
could get caught by belgian cops.
As i know him he won't stay
there for too long.
Your excellency, i invite you to the table.
- For now it's calm, nothing is happening.
- Have a look.
- We've been stuck here for too long. When will we go to get the money?
- Let him wait. It's better to wait...
- Wait, somebody stopped next to Lefebvre's car.
Let me see.
Asshole, i saw it.
They're cops, scumbags.
Let's test the toughness of their glasses.
So you brought the cops?
Here you go!
You wanted to screw me!
Just wait.
Let's split. Move it!
Your shitty son double crossed me,
he talked to cops!
I swear, it won't happen again.
It's in your interest,
trust me.
I have two good news.
First: old grandpa can go back home
because his famous son...
paid first payment of ransom.
And second news... watch...
Hold it! I'll take a picture of you.
"BESSE: MESRINE STYLE ESCAPE"
Say cheese.
One, two, three... cheese.
Done.
Here!
Life is beautiful and full of suprises.
Hello. Welcome.
- If you allow me i'd like to show you...
- Stop it, i'll take this one.
- I'll get the key right away.
- Hurry up!
...la la la, don't give a shit.
Move!
Where are the cops?
And here we are.
Try that one.
How much is it?
- I give up.
- You're under arrest.
Do you like it?
Here you go.
Last year, in may of 1979, when was Mesrine
sentenced to 20 years in prison,
the only thing was on his mind, how to escape,
because he always needs...
to draw attention on himself and confirm
his reputation as "The Public Enemy nbr.1".
Charly!
Charly Bauer, invisible man.
- It's not easy to get together with you.
- You know, i have so little time, Jacques.
Organization, comrades to which
i report...
I completely forgot, your ultra-left
comrades want to thank you...
something to drink, to eat, to go out. Is it true?
- You think, you destroy the system by yourself?
No, i don't think so, i know so.
I know what i am doing.
Have you read the newspapers? And my book?
- Have you read my book?
- Some parts. And not all of it i liked,
because there's nothing in it I could relate to.
nor what i fight for...
I tell it to you this way,
if we've met during the war in Algeria,
we would fight against each other.
- I know that and i would kill you.
- Don't be mistaken,
just because you and me don't have anything...
Ok... i've to go
home, to my family.
- Keep in touch.
- Yeah.
- If you need something don't be shy.
- It'll happen soon, friend.
What kind of moves are these? What?
Where are your manners?
- What manners?
- Shaking your butt in front of my friend.
- What should i say to you. You're just a cheap whore.
- What's that?
- Should I remind you where i bought you?
- You bought me? Nobody ever bought me!
- Anybody with some extra money.
- I said that nobody ever paid for me!
I'll never be bought!
If you'd just appreciate me a little bit,
you wouldn't talk like that.
- You talk about respect? Come here!
You're going talk about respect?
And the same time you're acting like a whore
in front of my friend!
- What friend?
- Shut up! Listen to me.
He was in jail with me. In jail!
And that's enough.
François was your friend, but you always must have
the last word, that's why you're alone!
That's how you end up...  completely alone!
- Why? You want to leave me?
- What are you talking about?
- Sylvia, you don't love me anymore?
- Leave me alone.
- Don't you love me anymore?
- I want us to leave. To leave.
- We'll leave, honey.
- You always lie. - No, i don't.
We won't go anywhere, they'll kill you. You will
get killed. - No, nobody will die.
- Promise it. Promise it!
- I promise you, no one will die.
- Charly.
- Hi.
Hey you little. My little man.
You're my little man.
No, that's not your mom.
Dear, take a care of visitors.
Awful conditions and at the same time an effort
to break you down, humiliate you.
That's true. They lock you up so they can
make an animal out of you, living dead.
We need to end this repressive, agressive system,
whos existence is based on judgements.
Are you aware, that gilotine compared to prison
with maximum security...
it's like amnesty?
Do you want to screw the system?
Then you're only pickpocketing thief.
- The need to rob from banks and not...
- Banks will always be around.
What are you doing with the money after robberies?
You're buying expensive jewelry for your girl
and cars for yourself.
Actually you're not fighting the system
but you're supporting it.
- I escaped from prison many times.
- How many times did you get caught?
- Have you given any thought to it?
- They won't get me anymore.
They'll have to kill me.
They won't have any other choice.
Otherwise I'm going to die by natural death.
Honey! Where you going?
- Well, well.
- I can't talk about anything in front of her.
She would cut my balls.
- What are you doing?
- I want to scatter the smoke.
- It's bad for your health.
- Stop it! You think you'll get killed by cigars?
You never know.
- Tell me you're happy.
- I'd like to go away from here.
We stay for a little while and
then we leave this country.
Don't worry if we stay together,
nothing will happen to us.
We love each other forever.
You're my treasure.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
That's Charly.
- Do you know Dallier? Jacques Dallier?
- Fascist journalist.
Corrupted journalist who works for
miniscule newspapers...
Read it. Read!
Read it out loud!
- "Mesrine, gangster without a bit of honor".
- He writes about me!
"The kind who doesn't stand behind his word
and snitches on his friends".
Asshole!
So what do you intend?
Let's go.
In the car! Get in the car!
Charly!
Reveal to me, your newspapers "Minute"
are they only for prisons with special regime?
"Minute" are too extreme. As soon as i get the money for interview
i'll go to live on an island.
An island?
And why not a french countryside?
French? Maybe when France was proud and respected...
But then, in 40's it surrendered to Hitler
and 20 years later to strong Africa and Arabs too.
- So you think Algerie doesn't belong to algerians?
- And America belongs to indians?
Who makes the country strong, savage or white man?
- You used to be a cop. What do you think about them?
- They're idiots, bunch of scumbags.
You should see how he crawls around you
big Jacques here, Mesrine there,
despise them.
In october of 1961 police was completely different.
Knew how to stand up to criminals.
But back then they had old Papón.
He was a powerful director.
If it would be you i would take care of
Broussard. He intends something with your daughter.
- You think he's capable of it?
- What do i know what these types are capable of?
- That's true. And what plans they have regarding me?
- They want to kill you.
I'm sure about that.
Wait here!
- Do you want a piece of gum?
- No.
Kalashnikov is good weapon.
- Dallier!
- Go.
Here you go.
Go!
This way.
Go, keep going! Quickly! Move!
Do we start the interview?
I will speak to Jacques Mesrine
who's ready to answer my questions.
- Are you Jacques Mesrine?
- Maybe I am.
So, you are Jacques Mesrine.
I don't know what you have been told,
but you seem nervous.
- Are you scared of something?
- It only seems to you.
You're not comfortable.
- I'm shocked.
- Why are you shocked?
After all you came to do interview with me.
Have you kidnapped Mr. Lelievre?
- Put the microphone down.
- What's that?
- I told you to put the microphone down!
Take all of your clothes off!
You want interview? We do it right now.
But first we have to see you.
Let's go, get undressed! Take them off!
So we see you came here
for an interview.
Take them off! They could think you belong to us,
but you don't.
- But you said that...
- Move!
- You always need a material, aren't you?
- What do you mean?
And then we put handcuffs.
- And now, my dear... we'll play.
- Hands! Hands behind your back!
- Mesrine, we are...
- Shut up! I'm talking now!
- Listen to me...
- Shut up!
I explain to you what we're going to do.
Dallier won't be doing the interview...
...but Jacques Mesrine will ask the questions.
- Wait, don't do it!
- What's your name?!   What?
- Your name!
- Jacques Dallier.
Jacques Dallier. That's right, Dallier.
That's the name of this dirt!
- Who do you work for? What cheap newspapers you work for?
- "Minute".
- What?
- "Minute".
- Oh yes, for "Minute", the fascist newspapers.
Did you write this? Did you write an article
about me? It is your article, isn't it?
- That's not my article.
- I advise you, you better don't lie to me.
That was you! You wrote the article!
What? You wrote that i'm not honest
to my friends!
I don't deal with my friends like that.
You tarnished me!
My friend is here. Ask him if i'm honest man!
If I'm honest!
Journalists, who talk shit about me,
i break their neck! I break it!
I show you how we used to do it in Algerie.
Look! You die, you asshole!
That's enough. Stop!
Don't be a fascist like him!
Stop!
If you want to, shoot him and let's end this.
You right.
Not necessary! We already made too much noise.
Anyway he's dead.
- You read the papers?
- Why?
- That dick Dallier is alive. Would you believe it?
- He's alive? So? Only better.
Better? What's so better about it? It's a disaster!
I told you not to send the photograph.
Even journalists, your followers
are shocked!
He wasn't even a reporter, just a regular snitch.
Judge however you want. You pissed off
journalists! You attacked one of them!
- Oh, one of them. So what? Just one.
- Read what the press is writing.
From now on, my friend,
bear the repercussions yourself.
Hi my love. If you're listening this cassette
my little Sylvia,
i won't be here. It's only my voice,
my voice for your remembrance .
That's the way it is my baby, your man is dead.
He was shot in barrage of police bullets.
You know kitty, the man who chose
the life of war, robberies,
At the end, it's not important
if i died alone or in police fire.
My death is like meaningless airplane catastrophy
or unfortunate coincidence.
Death doesn't mean anything for someone
who knew how to live.
A love for the law didn't work out,
but i had other love...
I became a gangster.
That was my choice.
I chose such life ,
an easy one, a criminal one,
my victims have always been
or almost always been a filthy rich.
After death i won't be guilty any more,
because i'll pay for everything.
but honestly, in the world of gangsters
heros don't exist.
In this world there are only people,
who live outside of the law.
I would die with gun in my hand even
if i couldn't use it.
If you're listening this cassette, i am in cell
i can't escape from.
Your newspapers Robert.
Barre pays off his last debt
to Robert Boulin
Once again they're full of crap...
Forget about it.
She's  walking down on Billiar.

He's looking around.
He's getting closer...
He's on Billiar.
- What's he doing?
- He's heading toward Moncen.
I see him.
He's walking slowly but not stopping.
Shit! What am i going to do

Relax Gégé, he won't notice anything.
- He's coming, He's coming
He's looking at the truck.
He's getting closer!
- I don't see them.
- What do you mean you don't see them?
They were next to me, but i lost them.
Do you see them? I don't see them.
I don't see anybody...
They just showed up!
I see Mesrine! He's with girl friend
in his BMW.
Both of them are getting out of the car,
she first.
She went in the building.
He got out of the car.
He's walking towards me.
- Calm, keep calm.
He's coming towards me. He's coming towards me!
What should i do?
he was leaning on me.
I almost shit my pants. Shit!
- They're going your way.
- I see them.
- In a few days I'll go to Milan to see Charly.
- Milan? What for?
- I have to.
- Why?
He wants to introduce me to his friends
from Red brigades.
- Will you take me with you?
I can't. Maybe next time.
BMW went by me.
Is going  by an average speed.
- Don't be sad. You can furnish our new apartment,
while i'm away. - Not without you.
- Suspect is standing three cars from me.
- All cars: Move towards Porte de Clignancourt.
I'll be back soon.
- Do you love me?
- Sure.
Suspect went on green light.
All units: The operation started!
This is Gégé.
I'm moving to Clignancourt.
Shit!
Did you know i was born just a half mile from here?
BMW is arriving at square.
Shit!
Go ahead, go.
Get out! Get out! I said get out!
Did you understand?!
Let's go! Move, quickly!
Get on the ground! On the ground!
- Lie down! Don't move. Stop twitching!
- You killed my dog!
- Hold her. Shut your mouth! Shut up!
- You killed my dog!
Hold her. Hold her!
Stop twitching!
Dog is here.
Take him to a veterinarian.
Seal it over here.
Where did the truck go?
It's over.
He's dead.
