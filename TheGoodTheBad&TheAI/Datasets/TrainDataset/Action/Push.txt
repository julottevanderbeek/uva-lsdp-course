Dad...
What's happening?
I need you to listen to me.
Like where the last people on the planet.
Okay Nick?
Someday a girl
is gonna give you a flower...
You have to get that flower...
and you have to help her Nick.
You help her and you help us all.
I know this doesn't
makes any sense right now...
But I believe the woman
who told me that...
You think you could believe me?
I love you.
Now they said you are special, Nick.
Turns out I was right.
The Division is here Nick.
Just keep moving...
and don't make any decision
that any watcher can track.
Move!
Everybody move out!
This one is a highly
compensation.
Out the way! Out the way!
What a waste.
Take his body to the lab.
There are special people in this world.
We don't ask to be special...
were just born this way.
We past you on the streets every day.
And noticed by most.
It started in 1945...
The Nazis were conducting
an experiment in psychic warfare.
Trying to turn those
with psychic abilities into soldiers.
Lots of us died.
The war ended but the experiments
never stopped.
Other governments around the world...
setup what they called "Divisions"
Trying to do what the Nazis couldn't
To turn us into weapons.
The Division's agent are trained
to track and hunt us down
like animals.
Take us away
from our families and friends.
They test us and
categorize us.
I'm they called a "Watcher".
We can see the future...
even if it's not always as simple
as it's sounds.
Others are called "Movers"
Just an easy way of saying telekinetic.
Pushers put thoughts on your head...
and make whatever lie they come-up
with the truth.
Sniffs, shifters, shadows, bleeders...
It goes on and on.
And in Division's eyes,
we're all just lab rats.
Only one problem...
we keep dying.
No one has ever survived the drug
meant to boost our powers.
My name is Cassie Holmes.
Division took my mom from me.
Right now...
The future I see
doesn't look so great.
The good news is
the future is always changing.
In the largest of ways...
by the smallest of things.
They've been winning a lot of battles.
Now it's our turn to win the war.
She survived the injection.
She's our patient "Zero".
Bring me every sniffer we have.
She's on foot.
She can't get far.
She'll get help from anyone
she can lay her eyes on.
Do whatever is necessary to get her
and that syringe back.
Now!
You want to bet or not?
What you say there Nick?
Who are you?
We're with the Division.
- Like you didn't know?
Go to hell.
- Easy son.
We warn you.
You'll be at the back of the van.
You gonna bet us in or
we gonna have to be rude?
Who's movin’ to
a shit hole like this?
One on top of the other.
Took you far off the radar.
How far enough?
Can you believe
this is how we found you?
From your old toothbrush,
from our encounter 10 years ago.
Barely I said luck.
Thought you were in Tokyo...
and Malaysia.
Finally we got a...
your reading from some buildings.
So lot of runaway psychics
in Hong Kong.
Trying to disappear Nick?
He vote no country... no loyalty.
No desires to get involve
in political bullshit.
Nobody but you in this apartment
for a long time Nick?
Why? Would someone else
besides me?
A girl.
She has something belonging to us.
I give a hunch you know her?
Obviously I don't.
In case we need
to get a hold you again.
I got some old toilet paper
you boys might like more.
Do bother running Nick.
We know where you are now.
Shit.
Yeah?
Hey Nick.
Who is this?
- Open up Nick.
C'mon put your gun down.
Put that thing away.
I got you somethin'.
Where is the chicken?
Oh, there it is.
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Excuse me.
Is this how you treat your guest?
This is how I treat
random strangers...
who barge into my apartment.
Like the Division's stepped first here.
Where just here.
Who are you?
I'm Cassie.
I'm here to help you.
Listen, Cassie...
sure your mom and dad are nervous
about you right now.
So why don't you...
You don't understand.
- You got that right.
This is about us
finding six million dollars.
That's us.
and that's seven.
That's my toothbrush.
You're a "Watcher".
So is your place can get
something to eat besides chicken?
I'm buying.
Lose your bet with a hair dresser?
I like color.
First things first.
I know you're a 2nd generation mover.
Is that what the kids calling at these days?
- How'd you know I see one?
You don't really use your powers
this means you haven't practice
You kinda suck out of it.
How am I doing so far?
Go on.
I'm a watcher.
- Wow.
That's...
- Complicated...
Cause the future can changes
by talking about it.
So I see glimpses
and I draw it in my book.
But I'm not really good at it.
I'm kinda crappy artist.
But...
I'm sure you already knew that.
I got to snooze
in your apartment, right?
That's why I brought you
a new toothbrush.
Do you speak Chinese?
Cantonese.
Which part you didn't know that?
being a watcher.
I got things wrong sometimes.
I know the feeling.
Are you worried about the tugs
you owe money too?
Don't.
Thank you.
We'll be able to take care of it
in couple of days.
With your six million dollars.
Where is the money?
- Right here.
With the girl.
Don't tell me.
The same girl Division's sniffs
are looking for.
It's Cassie right?
Enjoy your food.
That's it?
- That's it.
Sorry, some twelve year old that knew
that I needed a new toothbrush
isn't enough to get me involved
with a vision...
even if it's not a con.
I'm thirteen and I've been told that
at least I look fourteen.
Right.
- And this is not a con.
This is a way for everybody who's
something that they want.
I actually used that line before.
- Fine.
Don't believe me.
But you will help me.
Really? Coz I'm getting
a message and it's telling me...
Find somebody else.
If we do not find the case
and that girl...
really bad things happen, Nick.
What?
What's wrong?
Shit.
They're here in the market.
Who?
Who?
They're in the market, come on!
The vision?
- Bleeders!
We gotta get out of here!
How does this end?
- No idea.
Where is the girl?
My daughter has already
seen you with her.
Told you?
Look I told three people already today
I do not know this girl.
Stupid child.
I already saw how you die.
Then you know it's not here
and it's not today.
I already know you're here.
You must be Cassie Holmes?
Who sent you?
- Your mother.
A week before
she was captured by Division,
she told me to be
in that fish market today.
Stay away from him!
It's that what you want?
Just be sure to had he's picture
to the wall of the dead.
You stitch?
- That should be obvious to a watcher.
You had even a modo come
with your mother's talent.
I've been dealing with a lot.
Years ago...
your mother did me a favor
Now that's seem
I need to pay off my debt.
I heard they got your mother
buried deep inside Division.
So drugged up, she can't even
hold a spoon.
I bet they suck
the future right out of her.
You help her and you help us all.
with flower...
Is he okay?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
That woman got a magic fingers.
For you.
What is that?
- A lotus.
I heard what she said
about your mother said?
You did?
Division's got her.
They locked her up because she's
a greatest watcher I've ever seen.
They're afraid of her.
They afraid they can't control her.
They killed my father
for the same reason.
I guess you already knew that.
I see the future not the past.
Right now our future isn't that great.
That's a note?
Now they're messing your apartment.
I need to get the girl and the case.
It's changed.
I don't know why.
Something I did...
A mistake I made...
Doesn't matter...
Just has...
My mother told me that suitcase...
was the key to bring down Division.
And free her.
There is no money in that case,
is there?
Now lets' not missing something.
They don't have the case yet.
It's still out there.
If your mother is such
a great fortune teller.
How she get caught?
I just got to ask that to myself.
I haven't gotten to the bad part yet.
What is that?
We die.
Great.
Hello Kira.
You have a plane to catch.
Come on.
- You wanna come with us.
Christ.
Get a load of that.
She uses that right?
Ten times a day.
- Yeah that should keep her.
Your not could be having a lot of
lipstick opportunities where you goin'
You know what I mean?
She's doin' that again.
Get the hell outta my head!
- No, no, no!
What does she want?
She's gotta go to the bathroom...
to throw-up or something.
Carver will kills us
if anything happens to her.
Bathroom?
- This way.
C'mon.
Coffee, black, no sugar.
Alright.
In you go.
You are a good man agent Mack.
I bet you come from a good family?
It must have been hard for you
when he died?
Who died?
Your brother.
I don't have a brother sweetheart.
- No you do.
I got something
to make you feel better.
And you loved him very much.
But he was murdered.
And he know who did it.
Don't you?
But he was murdered.
And he know who did it.
Don't you?
And he know who did it.
Don't you?
But he was murdered.
And he know who did it.
he was murdered.
Lame.
You gotta find your skill or
we won't not change anything.
Don't bite you nail.
A lollipop should freeze me up.
She's a watcher.
Like you?
- Yeah.
Hey, I know this place.
This is um...
I know this place.
Club B Boss.
Science Museum Road.
Thank you.
Why is it all about at the Boss?
That's not olive it's a bead.
- It's a bead?
Yeah, it's a bead.
It's a shimmering...
similar to that.
Oh. It's look like a pimiento,
if I was gonna draw a bead...
It's bead with a shimmer.
What does a bead
have to do with it?
I don't know what the shiny
shimmering bead has to do with it.
Great.
Alright let's keep it simple.
Let's start with the bead and
see where it take us.
Sounds like a plan but...
What about the part all we die.
I remember growing up together...
Where we went to school.
How he died.
Excepts for this brother
you never had.
Is there anything else
you might have to put in your head?
I'm only asking because
I don't wanna be shot in the face
with screw-up made up sister
you don't really have.
I don't have a sister?
Agent Mack...
Your relieve of duty.
Get on the plane.
Eat some peanuts and go home.
She won't push me again sir?
She just caught me off guard.
The only thoughts in my head
are my own.
You’re willing to risk
your life on that?
Yes sir.
The put the gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.
Don't worry...
We already checked it.
It's not loaded.
Spread these beads to any sniff,
any watcher.
Any goddamn expectorate reader
in Hong Kong who knows up and down...
Until we find Kira.
What about the Chinese government
and there guys?
If the story is out
believers all over the country
will be looking for it.
We can't let them get the drug.
Or we will put a price on her head.
Yeah, this is it.
Hey, can you...
I just...
Put on everything.
Yeah, sure.
There you go.
You can keep it.
Thanks.
How much do you have?...
- Don't get more back.
That's not in the deal.
- It's enough!
It's not gonna be... Just give me...
- It's enough!
Hey! We need 5 minutes.
Now listen. This is ah...
A place for grown-ups.
So behave yourself.
- Shut up.
Sounds about right.
Now here's another one.
- Yes, please.
Show me more...
One more?
- Yes, please.
Queen of hearts
- Perfect.
Watch, slowly...
Show me, show me...
Ace of spades.
I think I know why we're here.
Got good hands.
- Nick
Your alone?
- Yeah. You?
What's goin on?
- Okay. Sit down.
Vodka Martini.
- Thank you.
I'll have one of those.
She'll have a coke.
My mom drinks when
she wants really clear images.
She's famous for it.
Maybe something without caffeine.
I got it.
That's five.
Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I know who you are.
When I was in Division...
Your mother was at the top
of every watch list there was.
You work for the Division?
You wanna know about the Division?
Ten years.
No thank you. No pension.
I was put out on the street
with a threat to not shift again.
Under the sniffs
caught up with me in Chicago.
I was just trying to buy
something nice for my wife.
Next day a get a call...
She’s dead.
Car accident.
But my wife... doesn’t drive.
But I don't have to remind you
how that feels. Right.
We need this.
- An olive?
It's a bead.
It's suppose to lead us to someone
we need find before Division does.
Excuse me.
May I?
Thank you.
- You 're welcome.
Got it right.
It's a little more round and shinier.
That's it.
It's just how I saw it.
It won't last long.
I'll take you to Emily Hu.
She's ex-half sniff.
Only works by referral.
Here's her address.
Thank you.
Bye, bye.
Good luck.
Can I help you?
- Hook Waters sent us.
A bead that looks like this one
supposed to lead us to a girl.
Are you with Division?
Are looking at us?
The truth is,
the girl who dropped that bead...
is supposed to have a suitcase
that will bring down Division.
Cassie here thinks, if we don't find it...
We die.
And you believe her?
She's pretty convincing.
Well, consider me unconvinced.
Well it looks like we gotta wait.
- For what?
You have about one minute to help us.
And what's that?
- That's your poster.
That is the bead.
- That's the clock.
You got but a minute.
You guys can't be serious?
Don't look at me.
This girl has been going out
with that pen all day.
Everything that ends up on this pad
seems to become true.
I just see it like I'm looking
at the photograph.
Look.
We want Division out of Hong Kong
just as much as you do.
It's gonna be a whole lot easier
if you help us find the girl.
Alright.
They've been spreading these
all over the city.
You'll find who you’re looking for...
on Kwun Tung Pier.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Speak in English?
No? That doesn't really matter...
I just need a ride.
Where old friends, right?
No, no, I should have called.
Sorry.
Kira?
Damn it!
What the hell you're doing here?
There goes my ride.
Let's go.
Go, what?
You’re the girl everyone's looking for?
I should kill you Nick.
- You know this psycho?
What happened to you?
- Now you wanna know?
What is that supposed to mean?
I thought you'd left,
You stopped returning my calls.
Division caught me and locked me up.
- What?!
And you never came!
I looked for you!
I did!
You didn't find me.
Done.
Whatever you had a thing, get over it.
I really suggest
we discuss this somewhere else.
Let's go.
Kira. Division's looking for you.
They're looking for the case
and so are you.
What's in that case Kira?
I do not know...
All I know is, as a woke-up on a boat
next to a note I written
saying to look for you
and help me find the case.
I don't remember anything
but last couple of days.
No matter how hard I try.
You must had yourself wacked.
Erased memories makes harder
for the Division to track you.
Not the ones of you.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
You wait.
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- No.
You, me and my mom.
I've never seen my mom's
death before.
It's her Nick.
She changing the future,
she's making it worst.
We gotta dump her.
- Don't.
Cassie...
Cassie, we just found her.
And she doesn't have the case
Which is what we're looking for
if you remember?
Yeah. I know.
We find her, we find the case.
The three of us.
Yeah and the Division finds her.
Oh yeah, the three of us.
We'll get a "Shadow",
so they can't trace her.
Satisfied?
- No!
Cassie you gotta trust me.
Hey, I'm not falling
for trust issues here.
You better do something quick,
cause' I'm getting sick
of drawing dead bodies.
That's him.
Hey Pinky.
- Hey Nick.
How ya doin'?
Alright we're feeling the heat.
Alright...
Here's how this works.
I get 10 gran a day for shadowing
miss trouble.
As long as  she stays
within 20 feet of me
no sniffs gonna find her.
I don't care if they're standing
right on top of us and a piece of finger nail.
Happy?
- Overcome.
Now c'mon,
let's find a place to think.
So Pinky...
your wife give you that name?
No, the Division gave it sweetheart.
Back in the day.
I'm Sorry, I can't remember
anything about the case.
Shocking.
Can I clean-up
without getting killed?
Do not forget to wash
behind your ears.
Nice girlfriend you got there.
- Yeah.
She used to be.
I met her when I cons
on Coney Island tourists.
We did everything together.
I mean...
So we're just gonna sit around
and wait for her
to get her memory back.
And hope that she'll tell where
the case is before Carver gets it.
Or us.
Great plan.
Where you going?
It's not chicken place down stairs.
Wanna come?
No, I'm good, I gonna stay here.
See if I can help.
Have fun with that.
Where're you going?
Relax Romeo,
I can shade her just fine out the hall.
I don't need to be watcher
to see where this is going.
Sorry.
I thought the bathroom
was on fire.
I had to get you
to come in somehow.
Did you push me?
- You like it?
Sure.
My father expects me
to find that suitcase.
So does my mother.
But you don't see it clearly.
Do you?
Too many things keep changing.
I already saw how you die.
Did you see it here?
You can change it you know.
Plenty of time to live
in Hong Kong every day.
Oh, we are going to change it.
You put a shadow on the girl.
You know that's only temporary.
That girl is the one who brings
all your little fantasies crushing down.
So tell Nick something
for me little girl.
Tell him my family gonna make
his brain pop like a tomato.
Tell him that's the future I see.
Oh boy.
Hello!
Where's the chicky, chicky
who can suck heel.
Are you drunk?
- Yeah.
Sorry, you know the procedure,
stuffs not good for 10 year old.
I'm thirteen!
And I'm empowering my youth!
I can't believe this.
- I am worth it.
You screw it all up!
- Alright. Give me this.
What is this?
We talked about this Cassie,
nobody's going anywhere.
What's this?
- You don't get it Nick.
She wanna kill us all basically.
But I guess we all gonna get killed.
- Yeah. Screwed up.
What "we" you mean that?
- You too!
Pop Girl is a better
watcher than I am.
Whoa. No one said anything
about a watcher.
I can only work long term
against the sniffs.
Good.
- No.
True story, you gotta watch her after you.
It's just a matter of time.
Alright then, we'll split up.
We got two things to track
instead of one.
It will be more difficult to keep two things
that one.
Pinky, you take Kira somewhere safe.
No. I'm not going with him.
No offense.
- Non taken cupcake.
I know your sweet on the champ.
I'll find him.
Let's let her sleep.
She saw me coming.
She is still dies.
She's gone now.
I'm just saying.
You okay?
- No.
Not until we find that case.
When was the last time you saw it?
Not since yesterday.
No luck on trying.
If we don't find it soon...
Their gonna kill my mom.
And it's gonna be my fault.
Look at me.
Hey! Look at me.
Will you think I'm gonna let that happen?
Now you said the future
is always changing.
Are there changes by just knowing it?
- You can change it.
Doesn't mean it will.
Good enough.
- What are you doing?
What are your gun gonna do?
Gonna try to make a better one.
Going after Carver
doesn't change anything.
It doesn't save me.
It doesn't save you.
It doesn't save her.
It's just a matter of time Cassie.
If I don't go to him,
he'll come for us.
Emily it's Nick.
Listen.
The Division sent a pusher
named "Carver" to Hong Kong.
I need you to find him.
Just use that feed I gave you.
I'm sure his hands are all over it.
I'm not hungry.
Henry Carver.
Now. That's a face I've haven't
seen a long time.
Sit down.
Pushing action pretty good there.
Give me one good reason
not to kill you right now.
Good.
Your trying to get inside my head.
Go ahead.
See if you can push me
before I can pull the trigger.
Well, ten years is a long time
to hold the grudge.
My father would disagree.
Piece a shit.
- Your father, I have respect for
He took a stand
with great integrity.
Which more than anyone
can say about you.
This is your attempt to...
- They gotta know this future?
I've got twenty of the best
watchers in the world
tracking every moment
of this time right now.
You die, Nick.
You all die.
Know who doesn't?
Me.
Are you sure about that?
Okay.
Kira is our patient "Zero"...
and with her,
we're going to create an army
the world has never seen before.
- I'm sorry? Am I suppose to care?
Fine.
Fuck the jurydism.
The girl will die unless she
receives the necessary injections.
And you’re not going to find it
anywhere but with me.
Maybe you care about her.
Tell me something Nick.
Her blood turned black yet?
No.
Inside it's running out.
Why she keep the matter away
from you too?
I take that as a yes.
You already know
the ending to this story.
You can only draw it
in so many ways.
I going to change it.
You don't believe that, do you?
Please.
Don't make me do
anything to myself.
Hurting you
won't change the future.
Like how this future goes...
So, by killing him?
Victor!
I think I just save your life.
No need to thank me.
You should just start
listening to me.
You look like shit.
Where is she?
- 5A.
Is she safe?
She's sick though. Pretty bad.
I need to ask you a question.
What's in the case?
It's a drug.
Some sort of psychic steroid
that boost our abilities.
Or kills us.
He want me back.
Because I'm the only one
who survived the injection.
Tell me why I just drew a picture
of me holding her shoe?
Is she okay?
What?
No, you got to be kidding me.
She's dying.
- Your not bringing me into this.
You’re already in it.
We need to know what key unlocks.
Please.
Cassie, how much does
the Chinese know?
Whatever we do, it could be more.
Their watchers
are better than me.
We know there's a suitcase
with a Division drug in it.
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.
- Can you draw us away out of this?
We can't change anything
without her tracking us
the second we do,
she's gonna see it.
What do you mean?
She sees intensions.
What we decide to do.
I decide to cross the street
so she sees me crossing the street?
What if nothing we did
makes sense?
We just keep changing our minds.
They didn't know exactly
what we're gonna do.
Will that throw it off?
It might be if we start to
find the case.
Whatever this key unlocks
is being shadowed.
Like I've never seen before.
It's this way.
That really narrows it down.
If it shadowed,
I won't be able to draw it.
It's the building you see.
I thought shadows weren't suppose
to be affected by watchers like Cassie?
Not.
We're not suppose to able to shade
the entire buildings either.
You wanted to see me?
I'm going to need your help.
Watchers from everywhere
are tracking us.
Carver, the Chinese...
Anything we think, we gonna do,
they know about it.
That's why we all keep dying
in Cassie's book.
Pardon?
You died outside the an elevator.
But how we gonna make
the future unpredictable?
By not knowing what we gonna do...
Until right before we do it.
A plan without a planning.
- Yes, right.
I'll write letters to each of you.
Giving you specific instruction.
You don't open it until
I tell you.
And the last letter
I write to myself...
and wipe the memory I've
ever had written off.
That's why I need you to find
the guy that wipe Kira.
Sure thing.
- That sounds like a great plan.
- Keeping a better one?
- I fine blind.
Yeah.
Cassie, give me one more drawing.
I need to know the exact size
and shape of that case.
And that syringe.
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.
You’re not going to find the stuff
anywhere but with me.
You die, Nick.
You all die.
You need the medicine
that Carver has.
I'm not gonna watch you die.
I'll come back for you.
I promise.
When do I open it?
When you start
to tell the truth.
You know when to open this?
You sure this is right?
No.
Nick.
Take an umbrella,
it's gonna rain.
You be careful too.
You make us chase you
half way across the world
Then you let it had
like Pinky Stein bring you in.
I'm sick.
- You're sick?
You don't know
what you are.
Victor, pay the man.
Of course.
I know I wouldn’t get paid yet.
Wait here.
Are you followed?
Never followed.
Where is this guy?
Which one?
- Yellow one.
The big one?
- Yup.
Wu Chang?
Your here about the girl?
You're the one that wiped Kira.
Five years ago, a woman told me
an American girl would come.
That was two days ago,
when she show.
I have a job for you.
Two hours ago, I wrote seven letters.
I need you to erase the memory
I've ever having written.
Seven letters,
two hours of memories.
The woman tell me those things.
She did not pay for you, too.
When you’re done,
I need you to open this and read it.
I need a minute.
- As you wish.
Like ah...
Wake up and forget who I am.
Am I?
Wait, wait...
No... Go. Go.
It's all gone.
The future has disappeared.
I lost the connection.
Okay, no problem here.
Thank you.
Red.
Right size, right shape.
No problem.
You better hurry.
It won't last long.
Go home.
Hello.
Did you really think you could
slip out of town with this?
Tell me.
Was this worth dying for?
You die slow.
My sister promised me that...
and the great deal of money.
Do you know how many
people in the world
would kill for this drug?
Now.
Where is Cassie?
Give me back on my feet.
You didn't see that one
coming did you?
Do you really wanna do this
little girl?
I know where the drug is,
more importantly.
I know how you die.
Do you wanna know
what the tiger means?
See if that would
make him love you.
My note says it
suppose to tell you
the Division has Kira,
It's said all off on there,
is everyone that complicated?
I know you can handle it.
This immune suppressant
will save your life
and allow you to reach
your full potential.
You are going to be
a better you, Kira.
You need to accept
this reality.
We're not try'n to hurt you, Kira.
You can fight, your will
be means everything to us.
I understand it's not your fault
for forgetting who you are
and running from us.
The drug has side effects.
We have no way of knowing
the severity.
I want you to know
that I blame myself for that.
Agent Hollis.
This isn't real.
You volunteered, Kira.
I was against it.
But you were certain you be
the one to survive the drug.
I had to support you.
After all, we we're partners.
Then you panic.
Do you think you made it
all the way here
and eluded us for so long
without any training?
That's the Division in you, Kira.
Now, let me help you remember.
Now, let me help you remember.
I'm trying to draw
something different, but I can't.
Somebody had to do
how I die.
It is a tiger.
Serious?
I don't know how,
but I just know.
I know I had to act
like I don't care
Sometimes...
I don't wanna die.
- Cassie.
That's not gonna happen,
okay?
Just tell me that
I'm a crappy artist
and I'm wrong.
You are a crappy artist
and you are wrong.
Listen to me.
You already done more than
enough for everyone.
The only thing you gotta worry
about right now is
keeping yourself safe.
But how?
You just start walking,
don't even think about
where you're going...
You just keep on moving
don't make any decision
any watcher can track.
You come across
some place safe...
You hide.
Simple as that.
I don't know how, but I know
this is gonna work out.
Promise.
No need to be scared.
Trust me.
It's more like it.
What you gonna do?
I can't tell you.
You made me look like a fool
in front of my family.
Don't worry.
You won't remember a thing.
Your mother is very proud.
I wanna make a deal,
the drug for the girl.
Okay.
Top floor, Mandarin street.
Where's the case, Nick?
- Kira.
Go ahead.
Remember that night
under the roller coaster?
We parked in the rain and
got this little bottles of jack
That's the first time
you told me you loved me.
He remembers.
I wanna hear from him.
I remember.
Never happened.
We met for the first time
yesterday.
You've never been
to Coney Island.
Nobody has been
to Coney Island.
I used Nick.
The quick we find that case,
the quick I let you forget it.
You might get wrong.
My card says
you have to take the drug.
Give me Carver.
Is for you.
Hello.
You want the case?
You let them loose.
I'll tell you exactly where it is.
Another?
- Sure.
One for the road.
Don't feel too bad...
That push of Kira's
has worked on better man.
Kill him.
What's wrong with you?
The case!
Agent Carver.
The contents of this case
are the property
of the U.S. government.
Government?
We are the only
the government here.
Be reasonable.
There's no need
for anyone to die.
There's not much for
diplomacy these days.
Victor!
Make the way out of here!
Kill him.
Kira!
Kira?
Die!
Oh!
I'm impressed!
We engineers are always
conservative with the projections.
This is something else.
Hey!
We're on the same side,
remember?
Why don't you march
the men who tried to kill us.
Off this roof
and we'd call it a day.
Wait, Kira, don't do this.
It's a push.
What Carver told you is a lie.
Sure, you made
a card for this.
Where we were.
Where we were!
You don't wanna do that.
Watch me.
You'd be doing me a favor,
if your dead.
What's in that needle will kill you.
I went to hundreds of
potentials to find her.
She our survivor.
Look at me.
You know me.
I know you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Let him do it.
What a waste.
I told you to bring an umbrella.
I thought you said
it was gonna rain.
I also told you, I get
things wrong sometimes.
Maybe they wash
the crap out of your hair.
So where's the real case?
There it is.
How long do you think your
mother has been planning this?
Just before I was born.
This is the key, Nick.
The Division would do anything
to keep this from getting
to the wrong hands.
So you trade your mom
for the drug?
I'm still workin' on that.
Hey, what was that I injected
myself with?
A known dragon
soy sauce.
That's gross.
What about Kira?
You’re the watcher.
You tell me?
Do not worry, we'll see
miss trouble soon enough.
When do I open it?
When you start to tell the truth.
KILL HIM.
SEE YOU SOON, NICK.
Put your gun
in your mouth.
Pull the trigger.
