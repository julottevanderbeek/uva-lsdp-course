{Breading Heavily}
{Sniffing}
Hands up Mother Fucker?
Don't!
- Calm down.
- Hey, fuck you!
- Calm down.
- Fuck you!
It's like his chute
didn't open.
- Single shooter!
- How do you know?
What the  fuck
Please, stop doing that!
You're shooting
at the wrong people.
How do I know?
Because otherwise, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.
Alright.
You want to show me
the right ones?
Nikolai.
I mean... I'm Nikolai.
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?
War.
Yeah.
I was at the Chechnya.
And then there was a light.
Then I...
Then I woke up
and I was...
Falling.
Yeah, same thing.
I was in Baja.
And then, there was a light.
And then, "chinga"!
{bird squeaking}
Okay.
Where are we now?
Maybe she knows.
Shit.
You want to lower
the weapon?
I've never seen this jungle.
And I've seen most.
Alright. You think that's Asia?
Maybe Africa?
Too hot for this time of year.
And the topography
is all wrong.
Amazon, maybe.
I saw more parachutes.
- Which way?
- Why?
So I can figure out who
threw me out of a fucking airplane.
What the fuck?
Where she goes?
Bullshit,
If we listen to this...
Alright,
let's take a fucking look.
Fuck.
Do you remember a plane?
I woke up in free fall.
You?
The same.
You're IDF?
Yeah.
You've been in the service?
Not exactly.
Motherfucker!
Move you motherfucker!
- You with him?
- No.
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?
We have bigger problems
right now.
Okay, boss.
Whatever you say.
I will finish
what you started.
Strength in numbers, huh?
- Stuff like that.
- Yeah...
Maybe we should get that guy
hanging in the tree.
Help me! Fuck!
Help me!
Somebody!
Help!
Hello?
I'm strapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree!
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- Oh, thank God!
I think I can...
Stop moving,
you are breaking the branch.
Do you have anything
to cut yourself down with?
Why would it...?
No, I don’t.
Look. If we can get him broke
from one of the chute.
Do something!
- Help!
- Taking too long.
Help!
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a doctor...
I was on my way to work.
Can someone please
just tell me...
what the fuck is going on here?
Your ass is awesome.
Look.
Hot Damn!
Who the hell is this guy?
What the hell is that?
Who would do this?
Whoever they are,
they take trophies.
In my culture,
the warrior with the greatest trophies...
- command the most respect.
- Whatever.
It's a test.
To see how we do
under pressure.
If this were a test,
you'd all be military.
Total strangers,
Live rounds.
This is something else.
Maybe it's ransom.
Back in Tijuana,
we kidnap you,
put you in an oil drum.
If the ransom not paid...
We light you on fire.
I hear these stories,
about these experiments
they roll on Cons.
They stick drugs in your food,
and sit back and watch what happens.
It's not drugs.
If there was a psychotropic compound,
we'd be feeling the residual side effects,
Loss of motor skills,
blurry vision...
and if it was a behavioral experiment,
I mean, there'd...
be a point.
What if we are dead.
- I was goanna be executed in two days.
- And I was in combat.
So was I.
This is Hell.
Last time I looked you didn't
need a parachute to get there.
But it doesn't matter
what happened, or why.
We're here...
the only question is...
How do we get out?
Where are you going?
- To high ground.
- We need to stick together.
Then you should follow me.
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
Yep.
Archaefructus liaoningensis.
That is really, really poisonous.
Wouldn't take more than one scratch,
cause total paralysis.
Thank you.
I will watch for you out here.
You made a buddy.
Hey.
We need to rest.
So rest.
You look like
you could use it too.
You got a name?
Look...
I'm sorry. You want to play
scout leader? Great.
Now you goanna follow me?
Fine.
But I'm not doing this...
I'm better on my own.
Want to see something
fucked up?
Well, between that
and the sun...
- I'd say we have a real problem.
- What about the sun?
It hasn't moved
since we got here.
What do you think
is really going on?
What do I think?
Spetznatz Alpha Group,
Los Zetas cartel enforcer,
R.U.F. that's a death squad
from Sierra Leone,
Yakuza in the Dawokei,
the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted,
and... him.
They're all heavy-hitters,
he doesn't belong.
Belong to what?
Well, I'd say
we were chosen.
What about you?
What about me?
You know the jungle,
all the players...
I'm guessing ex-military,
black-ops,
- probably a mercenary.
- You got a problem with that?
Not at the moment.
Good.
Something
was dropped here.
Same as us.
Not the same as us.
You said we were chosen.
Chosen for what?
Oh, shit.
Looking good there, boss.
Look out! Step!
Help!
- 12 o'clock. 110 meters.
- Take him! Take him!
We don't have to.
He left.
We triggered a dead man's trap.
It's two weeks.
Judging from
the rate of decomposition.
He took up a position here.
shooting in all directions.
This was a last stand.
United States Special Forces.
This is strange.
He's supposed to be...
deployed in Afghanistan.
What's he doing here
setting traps for us?
They weren't meant for us.
He was hunting something else...
- Something a lot bigger.
- Bigger?
The trunk was a dead-fall.
The rule of thumb
with a dead-fall,
is that you set the weight five times
that of the target animal.
Whatever it was,
it got through the trip-wires.
And did this.
Let's move.
What is it?
Nothing.
What is it?
Nothing.
We're goanna need
a new plan.
Hey, where are we going?
Someone put us on this rock,
there's got to be a way off it.
Ah!
What the fuck?
Hey, you know what?
Fuck this!
This is bullshit, man.
I want a gun!
Come man. You got
two mother fucking guns, man!
Somebody give me a gun!
Come on Russian,
you got a big fucking gun!
Come on man,
give me a gun.
Give me a gun, right now!
Give me a gun.
I'm ready to die.
Are you?
Help!
Help!
Fuck you!
Looking good there, boss.
Run! Run!
Come on! Climb!
Oh, shit!
No!
As bad as you are...
those things are worse.
Since we still eight,
they just... What? Left?
No.
The whistle.
They were called.
Alright. Listen up!
Everybody do a shell count.
We've got to
conserve ammunition.
Reload. Do it now.
Excuse me, I'm...
just what the hell is going on here?
We're being hunted.
The cages, soldier,
all of us.
All brought here
for the same purpose.
This planet
is a game preserve.
And we're the game.
In case you didn't notice,
we just got flushed out.
They sent the dogs in.
Just like you would
if you were stalking boar.
Shooting quail.
They split us apart,
and they watched.
Testing us.
How do you know all this?
Because...
that's what I would do.
- Fantastic.
- Wait...
- There are only seven of us.
- Help me!
Help!
Help.
- Wait...
- What?
It's a trap.
Help me.
Fuck me.
Help.
Wound one man.
Make him suffer.
Make him bleed.
Make him call out for help.
And set a trap,
and kill those who come.
I know,
because I have done this.
So we're goanna leave him here,
right?
Come on, look at him.
He's done.
There's nothing...
There's nothing else we can do, right?
Right?
We leave him.
I can't.
Then that's on you.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me. Help me.
It's a trap. It's a trap.
What are we goanna do?
We should go
to higher ground.
Really?
We're trapped
on an alien hunting planet,
you really think
the solution is to...
walk over?
It wants us to run.
That's how it hunts.
This is its jungle.
Its game.
Its rules.
We run...
we die.
What's the alternative?
We need to know
what we're dealing with.
The dog tracks go that way.
We go after it.
What?
No movement.
Looks like, we're not
the only things been hunted.
Oh, shit!
What the fuck is that thing?
This is a mistake.
We have to leave. Now!
Where's the tough guy?
He left us.
He's here.
Run!
Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run!
You set us up!
He led us into that
death camp.
Then hid and waited
for that thing to strike.
We were bait.
I needed to know
who we're up against.
- Now I do.
- A man is dead because of that.
This morning you were ready
to kill him.
Well it isn’t
this God damn morning, is it?
- Well at least he didn't die in vain.
- Why?
So we could find out
first-hand,
what it feels like
to have our asses kicked?
No, we found out that
there's more than one of them,
that they use projectile
and energy based weapons,
that they have some sort
of cloaking device,
that they're bigger than us,
stronger.
But also heavier.
You've put us at risk
for yourself.
Do you want to be in your own?
You got it.
Why don't you tell them
the true?
- I don't know what you're talking...
- You know what I'm talking about.
The way you looked to that thing,
that was strung up.
The way you reacted.
She knows what it is.
Don't you.
We don't have a name
for them.
'87, Guatemala.
A Spec ops team
went into the jungle.
High end.
Six men plus a CIA liaison.
Only one made it out.
In his debrief...
He said they came in contact
with something.
He gave a detailed description.
The thing on the totem.
It wore some kind of camouflage
that adjusted to ambient light.
Made it nearly invisible
in our spectrum.
It could see in infra red.
Heat signatures.
He used mud to block his.
That's how he beat it.
It hunted,
and killed his team.
One by one.
Whatever it is.
Wherever they're from.
We goanna kill 'em all.
We set up
a defensive perimeter.
Make it look like we're holding up.
And that will bring 'em to us.
We force them into a choke point.
We get 'em in overlap in fields of fire.
It can be done.
I can't do it alone.
You know man,
if we ever make it home...
I'm going to do
so much fucking cocaine.
I'm goanna rape
so many fine bitches.
About, what time is it?
Time to go rape me
some fine bitches.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah, totally.
It's like, 5 o'clock...
- Bitch raping time.
- Hmm, yeah.
- You should stay away from him.
- Yeah.
You still pissed?
Fuck you.
You know, what the difference
between you and me is.
We both did the same thing.
You just do it for your country
so you don't have to admit you like it.
What happened to you?
What made you so fucked up?
There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.
And those who have hunted
armed men long enough,
and liked it,
never really care
for anything else thereafter.
That's pretty poetic.
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?
No, actually.
That was Hemingway.
Where the fuck is it?
Why isn't it coming?
Let me see your traps.
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey.
I think I just figured out
a way you can be useful.
Shit!...
I'm in left side,
just I heard the sign!
Come on, come on,
come on!
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, come on.
Fucking shoot!
Shoot it already!
Fuck...
all of you!
Is he dead?
Why isn’t you smiling?
- Oh, shit.
- The thing from the cages.
Maybe he thought
we were going to draw up till here.
Good shot, though.
I missed.
What the fuck are you?
I'm alive.
You talk too loud.
I've smelled you
since you got here.
If I can smell you,
If I can hear you...
They can too.
Storm coming soon,
this way.
Wait.
Who are you?
Noland run away.
Live to fight another day.
I'm the one that got away.
The one you don't fuck with.
Come on,
fear revive in this place.
Where are we?
There's a journal
somebody left behind.
The machine's dead.
The power source, isn’t.
Wow, what a shit hole.
You live here?
Oh, no, no.
This is my summer home.
I winter in the Riviera.
The schools
are so much nicer there.
And the men?
Ooh la la...
By the way,
you're welcome.
How have you survived?
Salvaging what I can,
when I can,
from whatever I can.
Oh...
Noland, Ronald.
"Air Cav.".
They...
They drop you all in too?
Yeah.
Mmm...
What a rush?
Hey...
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Hey "Agent Orange",
you want to...
put that down.
Several people around here particular
about other people messing with their shit.
Very important, though.
Disrupts the heat signature.
You motherfuckers!
So you killed one?
Aha, I killed one.
Two...
Maybe three.
No, I can't remember.
Anyway, there's...
two different types of them
out there.
Now, they're similar,
but they're different.
It's kind of like, the difference
between dogs and wolves.
But the ones
it'll running things up there...
the larger ones
hunt the smaller ones.
It's some kind of...
blood-feud I guess, that's
been going on for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
- And they do this, just for sport?
- Oh, yeah...
And they bringing in fresh meat,
season after season...
I mean,
shit you wouldn't believe.
Bring it in...
and...
hunt it, and kill it.
In that order.
How long
have you been here, man?
Seven seasons,
I think...
What?
Ten?
Damn...
Anyway. Every once in a while,
one of us kills one of them...
and let me tell you,
that's when they get real interested.
See, they learn...
quick, they adapt.
They develop
a whole new set of skills.
They come back the next season.
In threes, always in threes.
Their armor might have changed.
Or their weapons
have changed, or...
their tactics have changed.
It's amazing.
So, it's like
an evolution...
They train to make themselves
in to better killers.
You said, they come back...
How?
- They got a ship.
- A ship?
Yeah. It's 30 yards
from their camp.
I told you they wouldn't see it.
I told you they wouldn't.
You were there.
You could've helped us.
How do we kill them?
However you can.
They must have a weakness.
Not many.
You want to survive?
You'd dig in deep,
you stay hid.
Yeah, well we're goanna go
with door number two.
How do we get out
of this valley?
Ten seasons...
The first two seasons.
No, three seasons I was here,
I was walking
in the same direction.
Trying to reach
the edge of the preserve.
Let me tell you something,
there isn’t no "edge of the preserve".
Maybe you or your friend
want to tell me about that ship.
I see...
That's...
a brilliant idea.
Brilliant.
The whole time I've been here,
it never occurred to me to...
commandeer the alien spacecraft.
But I wouldn't know
how to fly it.
He would.
Because you know
how to fly it?
I'll give it a shot.
Well...
I'm goanna get some sleep.
No noise,
they're out there.
They're always out there.
The water in there.
Help yourself,
all of you.
Who's that?
My kids.
The big one is Rein,
and Sasha.
This is...
Candy Lee.
Tits like Howitzers.
Is that your girlfriend?
No, it's my sister.
This is old.
Very old.
They've been doing this
for a long time.
You speak English.
Yes.
Why don't you say more?
Because I talk too much.
Thanks.
Do you know what I was doing
when I was taken?
Isaac, my spotter.
He was caught.
I could've done something,
but then I would've been
slaughtered along with him.
So I hid.
I watched him die.
I wish I pulled that trigger.
You're doing what you have to do,
to survive.
You said we were chosen.
I asked for what.
I should've asked why.
It's because we...
are predators.
Just like them.
We're the monsters,
of our own world.
It's only better,
that we're never going back.
No, I'm going back.
I'm going after that ship.
You're goanna hope to fly it
in the last hour, and now you tell me?
No.
That thing strung up in the camp
right now.
In my guess, it'd do
just about anything to get free.
Enemy of my enemy.
It doesn't make it a friend.
So, what do I call you?
Smoke!
Hey! Smoke!
Where's Noland?
He's a scavenger.
He wants what we have.
Come on,
there must be away out.
- Damn it!
- Do it! -- Let's get out of here!
You see the shit
you got us into, man?
I told you that, you'd never
listening to me, you know.
Six more,
six more fucking mouths to feed.
I can barely stand live
with you!
I want to live with
their food!
Damn it!
What?
Say goodbye
to your little friend!
You're in my house
motherfucker!
Get down!
- Yeah, that didn't open up shit!
- It wasn't meant to, asshole.
I'm calling in the cavalry.
Let's fucking get out!
Open up!
Do it, fucker!
Come on!
You finally found me
ha, big dog?
Well...
What took you so long?
It's not goanna open!
Come on!
God damn it!...
It's toying with us.
Guys!
Oh, shit!
Hey!
Come on.
This way.
Hey!
Hey!
I, I...
I lost you guys.
Come on.
You've got to get me
out of here, man. Come on.
Let's move.
"What a face you got on you!"
We killed it!
We killed it!
We fucking'...
We fucking' killed it!
We killed it!
We fucking' killed it!
Huh? Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?
Huh? Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?
Suck my dick, bitch!
Die you space faggot!
Who do you think
you're dealing with, huh?
Is that all you got?
Go! Go! Go!
Come on...
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Let's get to that ship.
Oh, shit!
Ah, shit!
Shit!
Fuck!
A another inch.
it would hit my tibial artery.
- I guess it's my lucky day.
- It isn't.
That trap wasn't meant to kill.
It was meant to maim.
He's dead weight.
Come on.
No, I can...
I can still walk.
Oh, shit!
God!
No, we can't let him through.
He's done.
You goanna beg us
to slow down,
- No, no, no....
- to carry you.
You can't leave me here.
You can't. I have a family.
I've... I got kids.
I'm sorry.
- We need to go.
- No, no!
You're taking me with you!
You're taking me with you!
Fuck you,
I can still make it.
We use him.
We booby trap him.
- No...
- They'll go to him to take trophies.
This is our last chance.
This isn't right,
he's one of us.
He is.
That's what they're counting on.
They want you
to feel something for this man,
to be human.
And what are you?
Alive.
What's that worth?
Please. Please, I'm begging you.
Please.
You should go.
- Come on.
- Okey.
- You should've gone with him.
- I know.
Hey.
I want off this planet.
You understand me?
I'll cut you down.
You take me to the ship.
The ship.
You understand me,
don't you?
Huh?
Shit!
- God.
- I'm sorry.
Well, we're not dead yet.
Shit!
I guess he made it.
If we can do it over again,
would you make
the same choice?
Yes.
Thank you.
When the time comes,
I'll choose both.
I promise you it will be quick.
No...
It won't.
That's right.
It's a neurotoxin.
So many to choose
from around here.
But don't worry.
It's not fatal.
You'll be able to experience...
everything.
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.
I was in front of you guys
the whole time.
Watching you.
Earning your trust.
You couldn't see me
for what I really am.
You see, back home...
I'm a murderer.
I'm a freak.
But here,
among the monsters...
I'm normal.
I like it here.
I want to stay.
Oh, you came back.
I missed my ride.
Oh, thank God.
Help us get out of here.
She's paralyzed.
Maybe they gave her something,
I don't know what.
But it paralyzed her.
Come on.
You're so busy,
you didn't care about it.
You've got
to look out for yourself.
We're getting out of here,
just stay in tight.
Now, I didn't think
you'd come back.
But she...
she never lost faith on you.
I guess I owe you an apology.
You are a good man after all.
No...
I'm not.
But I'm fast.
Come here.
Please, don't kill me!
Please, don't kill me!
I won't!
Help me.
I'm one of you.
Come on, come on!
Do it!
Over here, kill me!
Come on!
Come on!
Do it now! Kill me!
Oh, shit!
Did you kill it?
Yeah.
I'm Royce.
Nice to meet you, Royce.
I'm Isabelle.
Now...
Let's find a way
off this fucking planet.
