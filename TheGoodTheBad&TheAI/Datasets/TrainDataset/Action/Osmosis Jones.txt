Dad, you have the coolest job.
2
l should hang out with
a better class of animals.
3
Oh, come on.
4
Have some class.
We got mixed company here.
5
You know, genetically speaking,
monkeys are our first cousins.
6
Uncle Bob's kids?
l'd agree with that.
7
No, l'm serious.
8
Some scientists say their diets
are more evolved.
9
This is about diets again, huh?
10
You should eat more fruits and
vegetables. Like monkeys do.
11
Honey, the reason that monkeys
eat so many fruits and vegetables...
12
...is because they're not
smart enough to butcher a cow.
13
Your mother, bless her soul,
didn't believe the old ideas...
14
...about nursing and breast-feeding.
15
You were fed cheeseburgers as a baby.
16
And you're as strong as a bull.
Smell like a cow.
17
High cholesterol,
but there's medicine.
18
An angioplasty clears it out.
You're great, honey.
19
l'll start working out tomorrow.
20
-l'll take better care of myself.
-So you'll go on the hike with me?
21
First things first. Eat your lunch.
22
We'll talk later.
23
Give me that egg, pal!
Give me the egg!
24
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?
25
lt's my egg! Come on!
26
lt's just an egg!
27
Okay, now l gotta choke you!
28
Now who's evolved?
29
All that salad slow you down, buddy?
30
That's filthy.
31
Ten-second rule:
32
Hits the ground, you can
eat it within 10 seconds.
33
-Saliva one, what have you got?
-An egg 2-20. E-Gamma-Gamma. Over.
34
-Any mayo?
-Affiirmative.
35
Slow bowel traffiic....
36
Enzyme breakdown in ten.
37
When I was a rookie cell,
you could eat off this place.
38
Look at it now. Jeez...
39
...what a disgrace.
40
See anything, kid?
41
l do.
42
Nice genes. Got chromosomes
in all the right places.
43
-Jones.
-A toothbrush can handle this.
44
l wish you'd take this job
more seriously.
45
You see this badge?
You see this gun?
46
See this gooey sackus membranous
around my personhood?
47
-Here we go again.
-You dealing with a white blood cell!
48
I should fiight disease in the veins!
Not here, on tartar control!
49
Lucky you ain't in a scab.
50
We got germs on that egg.
51
Baby! lt's Ozzy time!
52
Probably gingivitis,
don't get carried away.
53
You have entered the city ofFrank.
54
Hands up.
Surrender for digestion.
55
Saliva one, requesting
ground support. Over.
56
Bicuspid four,
we're in the vicinity.
57
This is a private organism.
Don't run.
58
Up spit creek without a paddle.
59
Don't get me mad.
I will turn into a germicidal maniac.
60
Halt. Saliva Patrol.
61
Son of a botulism!
62
They swiped the patrol car!
63
Get out ofhere.
64
You done done it now.
65
Holy Frank!
66
He 's about to yawn!
67
We 're getting sucked in!
68
l told city hall we need more sleep!
69
Hold tight, kid!
70
Osmosis Jones to dispatch.
71
We got multiple germs
coming down the windpipe.
72
If they hit the blood stream,
we'll be illing.
73
Nose-dripping,
chicken-soup-drinking...
74
...rectal-thermometer-sticking,
illing!
75
-Permission to pursue?
-Chief.
76
-You got plans for the weekend?
-Oh, yeah.
77
Me and my girlfriend are going
to the lKidneys to see the Stones.
78
Good, they could pass any day.
79
All units south of the stomach,
lookout for illegal organism.
80
Jones, you want to keep yourjob?
81
Wait for backup!
82
l can get them.
83
I said stay put.
84
-Over.
-You heard the chief.
85
Out ofourjurisdiction.
86
lt's lmmunity's problem.
We should get to the mouth.
87
-Hey, Jones!
-Chief, you'll thank me later.
88
Don't think about it.
You're in enough trouble.
89
Jones!
90
Slow down! Slow down!
91
Wait, wait, what the--?
92
Shouldn't you be up in the mouth?
93
This is my bust. l saw him first.
94
You want Osmosis? You got Osmosis.
95
Bye-bye, cop!
96
Sorry, baby. But it's time
you take your medicine.
97
Dang. Always pulls to the right.
98
Dad, what's wrong? Oh, my God.
99
lt's a cramp!
100
Officer down.
101
These stairs are killing me, honey.
We may have to move.
102
But, Dad, there's only four steps.
103
All right, if you love it here...
104
...l'll build a ramp.
105
lt's been three hours since lunch
and we're still cleaning up this egg.
106
Man, would you look at all that gunk.
107
Seriously.
108
Does he roll his food
on the ground before he eats it?
109
We need to send a letter to the mayor
about washing our hands before we eat.
110
Like he's going to listen to us.
111
Hey, cells vote, man.
112
Cells vote.
113
Got you, you little....
114
Artie?
115
What's going on over there?
116
Holy spit.
117
Careful, l'm contagious.
118
l don't like!
119
l'll turn up the heat in here.
120
Connecting, please hold.
One moment.
121
Now connecting.
122
Mr. Mayor, how will you deal
with the fat-cell housing shortage?
123
l'd like to announce we're beginning
construction on a third chin.
124
We're having jock itch!
125
Any comments on today's cramp?
126
What about the hair cells
laid off from the scalp?
127
There'll be plenty of new jobs
on the back.
128
What about the request
for better nutrition?
129
don't know how to carry oxygen.
130
People, people you worry too much.
131
The body is in perfect shape.
132
No more questions. Thank you.
133
Do they know l work hard?
134
Nobody cares.
135
-Mr. Mayor--
-Leah, l've got a body to run.
136
-l've got Tom Colonic's new ad.
-Let's go, put it on.
137
This is a paid announcement.
138
The bowels didn't always
smell this way.
139
Eating right and exercise...
140
...kept this area
a center ofactivity.
141
But during Phlemming's term,
rot and stagnation...
142
...paralyzed this neighborhood...
143
...the colon, and the sphincter.
144
It's time we get things moving again.
145
I'm Tom Colonic.
As mayor, I'd set long-term goals...
146
...that include salads
and eating bran.
147
Mayor Phlemming may think
things are fiine the way they are.
148
But if we pull together
andput in a little hard work...
149
...a new Frank could be
right around the corner.
150
Mr. Colonic? What's that smell?
151
That's the smell ofchange, Billy.
152
The smell ofchange.
153
Paid by Colonic for Mayor.
154
Can you believe those lies?
155
He's got a point. You promised
to focus on health issues.
156
l want health...
157
...but think of the sacrifices,
the hard work and lack of chips.
158
That's not what voters want.
159
-Why are you behind in the polls?
-Don't you worry.
160
l have a plan to flush Colonic
down the toilet.
161
Honey.
162
Shane.
163
Coming!
164
You okay? Where does it hurt?
165
Leg.
166
ls it here?
167
A leg.
168
Here?
169
Leg.
170
Here.
171
l just needed some sodium.
172
That's what made me cramp up.
173
Heads up!
174
Chicken going down rough.
Going down rough.
175
Oh, now what?
176
Sir, turn on the optical feed.
177
Let me take a look, Dad.
178
Open wide.
179
Open wide.
180
Could you swallow first, please?
181
Definitely red.
182
Are you ordering out?
183
l'm making an appointment
with the doctor.
184
Sick? We're not getting sick!
We have far too much planned.
185
You can't override without
a vote from city council.
186
Yes, my dear.
187
Voice manual control on.
188
-That's only for emergencies.
-Leah, this is an emergency.
189
On second thought...
190
On second thought...
191
-...I'll take a coldpill.
-...l'll take a cold pill.
192
Uh, sir?
193
Thank you. Get me the chief.
There's a good girl.
194
''Drixenol.''
195
Next.
196
l caught him with six micrograms
of adrenaline.
197
lt's not mine.
l swear, it's my cousin's.
198
Yeah, l never heard that one before.
Take him to lockdown. Next.
199
Hey, it's ''the Germinator!''
200
You got me there.
Save some for the criminals.
201
-You never catch anything, Jones.
-You should've seen this thing.
202
lt's no ordinary germ.
203
This thing ain't even
from Frank's body.
204
This is like a Al Roker germ,
a Heavy D germ.
205
Talking about this?
206
Yeah, he's slouching right now.
207
ln my office!
208
-Chiefy-weefy, what's up?
-Don't ''chiefy-weefy'' me.
209
See the headlines?
210
The papers call it the most powerful
cramp since Shane made us try Tae-Bo!
211
-Hold on a second.
-l told you to wait for backup!
212
But again, you had to
do it your own way.
213
-Man, l could have--
-Right!
214
Trillions of cells
working together...
215
...you're the only one doing it alone.
216
That's your problem, Jones.
217
What?! Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.
The missus? She's great, yes.
218
What? l'll put a man right on it.
219
Yes, sir.
Stupid political decisions.
220
Now where was l?
221
You said you were giving me...
222
...a promotion to
Head of Brain Security.
223
You know what? You're right.
Maybe it is time l give you a case.
224
Talking about what?
225
l'm putting you on a job
in the throat.
226
Thank you, chief. Thank you, chief.
You won't regret this.
227
You a good man.
You a upstanding man.
228
-Whatever.
-lt was on the fence for a while.
229
''Good man, bad man.''
Now it's official: You are a good man.
230
You done? Now our pill
is getting swallowed as we speak.
231
So get your nucleus
down to the stomach, pronto.
232
Pill? What pill?
233
l wouldn't trust you to
handle a sore throat alone!
234
Get out. Or you're on butt-hair
patrol for the next three years!
235
Rinky-dink, stink, pinky pill.
236
The white zone is for ingestion and
digestion only. No parking.
237
Peanut boarding
for intestine and liver...
238
... with direct service
to the colon.
239
Now boarding.
240
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna....
241
All right.
242
All fat cells
proceed to love handles.
243
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayor.
244
No, sir, it hasn't arrived yet.
245
What the--
Look out now.
246
Did you look at my notes
on your speech?
247
The in-box.
248
Yes, it says ''in'' on it, sir.
l'll check back later.
249
All right, goodbye.
250
Well, well, what do we have here?
Somebody been working out!
251
Leah, you looking fine.
Mighty fine.
252
Did they have to assign you to this?
253
Spit. Wasn't my idea,
but now l like it.
254
Baby, when are we hooking up?
255
l know a spot behind the eye,
has a perfect view.
256
Perfect for a little rendezvous
between me and you.
257
Do you know what l'm saying?
l been saying it a long time.
258
Why would l ever go out with you?
259
What? l'm a legend!
The chicks line up to divide with me.
260
Oh, really?
261
You look like a cell
who divides with himself.
262
Who cut off the heat?
Somebody pay the bill! lt's cold.
263
Now arriving with some milk, a cold
pill with a pleasant fruity flavor.
264
Wow, this is huge.
265
Don't be all impressed.
lt's 99% sugar.
266
Yeah? And 99% of you is just stupid.
267
Like l haven't heard that one before.
268
What is that cherry stank?
269
Special agent
Drixobenzometaphedramine.
270
''The brand that eases
your coughs and sneezes.''
271
Don't exceed dosage.
lf symptoms persist, see a physician.
272
May cause drowsiness.
Do not operate machinery.
273
Pregnant women shouldn't handle pills.
274
l feel better already.
275
-You can call me ''Drix.''
-Welcome to Frank.
276
l'll examine your irritated areas.
277
Never on the first date, Drips.
278
-Drix.
-l said that.
279
-You said ''Drips'' with a ''p.''
-Whatever.
280
This ain't working. l'll ask
the chief to assign someone else.
281
Wait.
282
Hold up. l need this job, Leah.
283
Just give me a shot.
284
All right. But no screw-ups, you dig?
285
l promise everything will be fine.
Not as fine as you, but fine.
286
Man, what you been eating?
287
That's my effervescent propulsion.
288
We're driving with the windows open.
289
l don't want bubbles
stinking up my ride.
290
You got that?
291
Look what you're doing to my baby.
292
Don't touch my radio!
293
Where you from?
294
The University of Chicago,
graduated Phi Beta Capsule.
295
Great, got me a college boy.
296
FDA-certified for colds and flu...
297
...and a master's in Symptom Relief.
Where'd you study?
298
l grew up on the wrong side of the
digestive tract. No fancy schools.
299
My high school was crack central.
300
No, it was in the crack!
Right in the stanky puckered center!
301
We lived on peanut butter
and cellulite sandwiches.
302
Ever blow-dry your hair with a fart?
303
-Okay, you were poor.
-You bet!
304
Ever make a snowman from paper
cling-ons? That's poor!
305
You'll make me vomit.
306
We couldn't afford vomit,
that's for rich folks.
307
-I have to wipe my eyes.
-Wanna talk about wiping?
308
You're all new so follow my lead,
all right?
309
Wait up! Didn't they teach you
manners in that lvy League petri dish?
310
Murphy, it's flaring up again!
Give me a status on the pain relief.
311
Foreign substance in upper....
312
lnflammation and glandular swelling.
We meet again.
313
Dougy-Doug, the firebug!
314
My boy is hot!
315
Osmosis Jones.
Like l don't have enough problems?
316
Start redirecting traffic over there.
317
l'm in charge of this
sore throat, baby.
318
-You're kidding me.
-No. Straight up. What we got?
319
lt's a routine sore throat.
320
Looks like a saliva boat
went haywire and crashed.
321
Saliva boat? That's pretty unusual.
322
lKnock down that hot spot, ladder team!
323
Step away.
324
The tamperproof seal is there
for your protection.
325
Not my suedes!
326
What the dilly?
327
Por favor, don't shoot!
328
La Muerte man esta aqui!.
329
He'll kill us, hombre!
330
Talk English, man.
We ain't on Telemundo here.
331
La Muerte Roja!
He's coming, man. l saw him.
332
l saw him. l saw him!
La Muerte Roja--
333
When your body's full ofaches
A Drixenol is all it takes
334
Excuse me! What are you doing?
335
l'm soothing the irritation.
336
You just soothed my witness
into a germ-cicle.
337
Don't worry, he'll be normal
in a few days.
338
That's too late.
339
He has information on what went down.
340
Nothing ''went down.''
lt's a common sore throat.
341
This is a crime scene.
342
Want to be useful? Plug some
Turtle Wax into that thing...
343
...and wash my car!
344
Now that's inflammation relief.
345
Later, Doug.
346
Be cool, Oz.
347
How's it feel working with
the two dumbest animals in the zoo?
348
-Not bad.
-lt's okay.
349
l'm talking to the camels.
350
They're talking to the camels.
351
Excellent.
352
l'm so psyched for this long weekend.
353
Getting out of town?
354
l'm not getting out of my bathrobe.
355
l'll get a keg and plop myself down
on the sofa in front of the TV.
356
Some quality time
with the wife and kids.
357
What's that smell?
358
That's Bruno. His tummy's still upset.
359
No, l'm talking about that
nasty, skanky, sweaty smell.
360
Shane won't buy me deodorant anymore.
361
She says it causes cancer.
362
Did the foot fungus pay up yet?
363
No, that guy's getting flaky on us.
364
You ain't going to collect
nothing from him up here in the pit.
365
Now get down there,
send him a message.
366
So, this is where the scum of Frank
comes to fester.
367
Hey, you lost, pal? This is
a private sweat gland. Now beat it!
368
l'm looking for volunteers. Some
germs who want in on a big score.
369
Yo, Red, we run the rackets here.
Take your hustle someplace else.
370
This ain't about no hustle.
371
This is about the baddest illness
you've ever seen.
372
Look who thinks he's
the Ebola virus, huh?
373
Ebola?
374
Let me tell you something
about Ebola, baby.
375
Ebola is a case of dandruff
compared to me!
376
All right, pal. You're out of here.
377
Bruiser, take him to the face
and bury him in a blackhead.
378
lt'll take a Swedish facialist
and six steaming washcloths...
379
...to get you out!
380
Sounds like a gas, baby. Bring it on.
381
Bruiser! What are you? A sissy Mary?
382
What are you doing?
383
Che fa? What's he doing?
384
You ain't so tough, huh?
That was nothing.
385
So, uh...
386
...what kind of sickness
do you have in mind...
387
-...boss?
-Deadly.
388
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Uncle Bob.
389
Hello, beautiful.
390
l stopped by the camping store...
391
...and l got some stuff for the hike.
392
Right. On this hike, is that
teacher of yours going to be there?
393
Yeah, my whole class is.
Why?
394
l was thinking l might
take a rain check.
395
Mrs. Boyd isn't still mad at you.
396
l didn't think so.
We could do something better.
397
Yesterday, without thinking,
l did all my hiking for the week.
398
l hiked to the liquor store,
the cigarette warehouse....
399
-But, Dad, you said--
-l said l'd think about it.
400
lt's a holiday weekend.
lt's important to be together.
401
Yeah, l guess you're right.
402
Well, l have something special
up my sleeve.
403
Have you ever seen a rattlesnake
swallow a football?
404
l don't think she has.
405
lt's fun. Come on.
406
-Come on. l'll show you.
-Thank you, Uncle Bob.
407
You're gonna love it!
408
Why are we wasting time here?
409
l am on a 1 2-hour
time release program.
410
-Throat, nose, then aches and pains.
-l got it.
411
Real important stuff.
Wait in the car.
412
l got police work to do.
413
One glazed and one
with a jelly-filled nucleus.
414
Brain memory library.
415
You got any information
on something called...
416
-... ''El Morry Roho''?
-Stand by.
417
l'll check, but we're really
all about sports statistics here.
418
-Sir?
-l'm here.
419
-What you got?
-''La Muerte Roja'' is Spanish.
420
-It means ''The Red Death. ''
-The Red Death?
421
-ls that some taco sauce?
-You have a nice day.
422
Yo, Drips!
423
You ever hear of The Red Death?
424
Look alive, boys.
Dust at nine o'clock.
425
Eat hot nose juice, dust.
426
-We're here. You happy?
-Hear that?
427
Quick! The dam is under attack!
428
Hey, chill, pill!
429
Snot guns are booger-coating
some dust.
430
Now, get to work!
431
This is your big plan?
A sore throat? A stuffy nose?
432
-People will think you're--
-A common cold.
433
Until l make my move,
that's precisely what l want.
434
Yo, check it out. We got cops here!
435
Hey, look.
436
Be careful! That's a pollen pod.
Frank is allergic to this stuff.
437
-l didn't know he had allergies.
-Of course not.
438
Pills know nothing
about what goes on in here.
439
ln the words of the immortal
James Brown, get down!
440
James who?
441
-Hey, Frank.
-Danny.
442
Nitwit!
443
You could've damaged the dam!
444
Relax, this baby was built to last.
Solid cartilage.
445
You're an engineer now.
l need to test the mucous viscosity.
446
Frank! Why are you leaving so early?
447
lt's all shoveled. Hippo's asleep.
l'm taking Shane to Docky's.
448
-Did you think of something?
-Yeah, l did great.
449
l guarantee you there ain't
nothing wrong with this dam.
450
So you want me to take care of them?
451
No. Hit all the pressure valves.
They're about to blow the scene.
452
What in the name of sweet
bleeding Frank?!
453
The membrane is cracking, you--
454
-You missed a spot!
-Come on, fellas. Go!
455
-Let's get out of here!
-Stop!
456
lmmunity!
457
What the Frank?
458
Wait a minute!
459
Nose hairs!
460
Watch out!
461
Look out!
462
We're going to die!
463
l'm standing here.
Can you use a tissue?
464
-l don't have one.
-Use your imagination.
465
What's that there?
466
-Better?
-Much better.
467
-Better?
-Much better.
468
l gotta go get her. She'll be
excited and probably call you.
469
lf not for you, none of this
would have ever happened.
470
lf you'll excuse me, l...
471
...have a nose to dry.
472
This is Nerve Network News. NNN.
473
ln an act of selfless bravery,
a cold tablet stopped a runny nose.
474
The heroic tablet will be
honored this afternoon.
475
Trudy?
476
ln lighter news, there was pandemonium
in the stomach today...
477
...as animal crackers arrived.
478
They are adorable, aren't they?
479
Now, we go live to Cerebellum Hall for
an address from Mayor Phlegmming.
480
Okay, Mayor.
481
ln five, four, three....
482
Good evening, citizens of Frank.
ln the past few weeks...
483
...my opponent has used fancy words
to try to confuse the issues.
484
Words like ''exercise,''
''low-fat,'' and ''diet.''
485
Words designed to scare us into
changing what has worked for years.
486
Well, l say let's stay the course.
487
Remember, a fat Frank
is a happy Frank.
488
That's not what l wrote.
489
l propose something that every
organism in this city will enjoy.
490
l give you...
491
...a dream vacation to
the annual chicken wing festival...
492
...in Buffalo, New York.
493
Final plans have been made and nothing
is going to stand in our way.
494
And we're out.
495
-That wasn't the speech we agreed on.
-Where's the twerp in the wheelchair?
496
Hello, Johnny. How you doing?
497
Congratulations. Excellent work
in the nose. Let's get some pictures.
498
The caption should read,
''Mayor and Pill Stop Cold...Cold.''
499
Mr. Mayor? Excuse me, sir,
but we have a problem.
500
Now what, Jones?
501
Whatever was in the sinuses
is a lot more than a cold.
502
Don't listen to Jones. His diagnostic
skills are remedial at best!
503
You iced a key witness
to a viral attack!
504
lt was an accident!
505
The kind a time-release dipstick
would have.
506
l am sick of you!
That's it, l can't work with him!
507
l can't work with you!
508
Officers, please.
509
-Jones, what's this virus?
-The virus that torched the throat.
510
lt caused those snot crests
l was surfing!
511
They were caused by the sneeze,
which you caused.
512
Then why was that
viral-looking mother fleeing?
513
We should put the city on full alert.
514
-Liquids, bed rest. Just to be safe.
-We'll do no such thing.
515
l won't listen to the white blood cell
with the worst record in Frank.
516
lKeep those opinions
in that mushy head...
517
...or you'll find yourself
in our next nosebleed. Understood?
518
Son, l apologize for all this.
519
Now, why don't we find you
another...
520
...more capable officer to work with.
521
Sir, if it's all the same to you...
522
...l think l'll stay with Jones.
523
Suit yourself.
524
You didn't have to do that.
l don't need your sympathy.
525
lt's not sympathy.
526
l'm here to make Frank feel better.
lf this alleged virus...
527
...impedes my mission,
l must pursue it.
528
Yeah, whatever.
529
What did the mayor mean by ''record''?
530
You did something terrible,
didn't you?
531
Sometimes being too careful
is all it takes.
532
How so?
533
l was cruising the digestive tract,
just minding my own business.
534
Outside was Shane's science fair.
Everyone was excited.
535
The winner would get their picture
in the localpaper.
536
-Think they'll like my volcano?
-All the parents are going home sad.
537
Their kids' projects are cardboard
and glitter paint and science.
538
Shane, yours is art.
539
-Wow, what a great tepee.
-Tepee?
540
Mrs. Delirious, come on.
541
l'll check the competition. Try and
learn them something about volcanos.
542
Partner, what you got there?
543
These are polluted oysters.
Well, they were polluted.
544
l replanted them six months ago.
That's how long the state says.
545
Every time the tide came in,
they'd flush...
546
...all the bad stuff out.
547
Can you eat them?
548
Well, if my hypotenuse is correct,
sure.
549
Yeah, definitely.
550
You got yourself a sale.
551
You should check your math
on that one.
552
I was in the kidneys
while a 6-31 was in progress.
553
That's incoming shellfiish.
I went to the stomach, to be safe.
554
Unscheduled shellfiish
now arriving at gate six.
555
And you must be Shane's dad.
556
Guilty as charged. Frank Detorre.
557
Pleasure to meet you.
l am Mrs. Boyd.
558
l am Shane's science and PE teacher.
559
l am just absolutely crazy
about your daughter.
560
She is a doll.
561
lf you mean that, l'll keep her.
562
Oh, my God.
563
That is so funny!
564
Oh, my God, l got the giggles.
565
She's a sweetie-pie.
566
She wants to go to the city
and help people someday.
567
No kidding.
You mean like a concierge?
568
No, like, poor people.
569
Yeah, she told me that.
570
Frank, it's so wonderful to see...
571
...Shane participating
in the science fair.
572
Since her mother passed away,
she's had a really hard time...
573
...being part of the group activities.
574
She's going to be okay.
575
And then I saw him.
576
He was on the clammiest oyster
l'd ever seen.
577
Mr. Detorre?
578
Are you okay?
579
Those oysters.
580
The oysters?
Oh, yeah, that's Zach's project.
581
He's a little slow.
582
The doctor says he has a brain
the size of a tangerine.
583
We gave him this project
to push him along.
584
He just started it this morning,
which is funny.
585
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.
586
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.
587
Mr. Detorre?
588
There was no time for questions.
I did what I had to do.
589
Look at that guy!
590
You can guess which photo
made it to the paper the next day.
591
Overnight, Frank became
the town laughingstock.
592
The photo ran in every daily
across the country.
593
He got fiired from his job
at the pea soup factory.
594
Lucky for us, Bob hooked up
Frank with ajob at the zoo.
595
It was a 90% cut in pay,
but it was the best we could do.
596
Needless to say,
none of this helped Shane.
597
And as for me, l got suspended
for unnecessary force.
598
Since then, every day l wonder:
599
''Did l do the right thing?''
600
From the description,
it sounds like you were justified.
601
Excuse me?
602
Oysters are filled
with dangerous bacteria.
603
l've been trying to tell everybody!
604
-I never thought you'd be on my side.
-I never thought you'd be right.
605
Sir, we have a strict
no-shoes-no-service policy.
606
You have to leave.
607
ls that how you treat
the handicapped?
608
Handicap?
609
l have a chronic
ingrown-toe condition.
610
Doctors say that soon
l won't be able to wear...
611
-...even the roomiest of footwear.
-l'll bring your menus.
612
Bring some clam strips
and some steamers...
613
...when you come, please?
614
What's the big surprise?
615
l know you wanted to go
on a trip this weekend, so....
616
Buffalo?
617
Buffalo, New York.
618
The buffalo wing festival
this weekend.
619
Great. So, what's the big surprise?
620
We got tickets!
l called a scalper!
621
Look.
622
Ninety-nine kinds of wings.
623
One hundred and twenty-eight
different dipping sauces.
624
You love math.
Crunch the numbers on that.
625
The possibilities are infinite.
626
Look! Here you are.
627
Ms. Chicken Wing Festival.
628
See this?
629
He's the champion.
But he won't be for long.
630
Because l'm coming.
l'm coming to get you, baby. Fun?
631
Yeah, that's really cool, Dad.
632
See, l told you she'd be excited.
633
Now, tidy up, will you?
634
Okay, Frank. This is your conscience
speaking. Now listen carefully.
635
This hiking trip means
a lot to her. Make it work.
636
Use that charm.
637
What's wrong now?
638
Oh, jeez.
Oh, it's this damn toe.
639
Do me a favor, huh?
640
Don't you get old.
641
Listen to the toe.
Don't you get old.
642
Boss, your plan worked.
643
That's right. l got this city
exactly where l want it.
644
-What about the cop and the pill?
-lf they give us a problem:
645
Fire!
646
Get it down! Money on the wood
make the game go good.
647
Five bucks says size don't matter.
648
Let's do this thing now.
649
-Chicken-pock fights.
-Get back!
650
Yeah, get him!
651
That's my baby! Try the headlock!
652
-See that dude?
-A virus! We should arrest him!
653
No, that used to be a virus,
now he's on our side.
654
-That's Chill. He's a flu shot.
-He doesn't look fluish.
655
Just stay here and watch
the maestro work.
656
Yo, Chill! Chill!
657
Pock fights are against the law.
658
Where you all going?
659
Thanks a lot, junior.
You just cost me twenty.
660
Money won't be your problem if
you don't tell me about the sinuses.
661
l was injected into this body
to rat on influenza only.
662
And this don't sound
like influenza to me. Now beat it.
663
l bet Johnny Streptococcus and the
Melanoma family will be interested...
664
...to hear about your work.
665
You can't jack me on that, brother!
l'm in the virus protection program.
666
You, virus. Children's strength
ought to take care of you.
667
You done done it now, Chill.
He's a psycho cop.
668
lt's too late to spill it.
669
Just off the Thorazine.
He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
670
He's going El Pollo Loco
on your crazy behind.
671
l just can't look.
672
All right!
673
The guy's big time.
He goes by the name of Thrax.
674
Go to that new place.
The Zit, on the head.
675
You can't miss it. lt's huge.
They're meeting tonight.
676
l'm out.
677
But you didn't hear that from me.
You didn't hear that from me.
678
Next time, l'll be the bad cop.
679
You are a bad cop.
680
Who you calling a bad cop?
681
My, what big zits he has.
How does this happen?
682
You wash your face
with fried chicken.
683
Wait. Where do you think you're going?
684
-To get our cootie.
-Like that?
685
-They'll tear you up. Get spiffy.
-Spiffy?
686
Peep this. Check it out.
687
Pliable cellular dynamics.
What an ingenious defense mechanism.
688
Ooh, let me try.
689
What do you think?
690
You should guard the car.
691
This is my mission too.
l am going in with you.
692
All right. But we gotta
get you something to wear.
693
You sure this is working?
694
Trust me, it's perfect.
695
Perfect.
696
We got company. Be cool.
697
Now, try to relax. Fit in.
Shake a tail cell or something.
698
l don't dance.
l have no left feet.
699
You don't dance?
700
Don't tell me you ain't
never gotten jiggy with it.
701
l don't believe l have.
702
Come on, baby, give me
a little bit of this.
703
Oh, all right.
704
-Here you go.
-That's it, baby.
705
-Get down.
-Don't let it settle at the bottom.
706
Oh, mama. Yo!
707
You stay and practice.
Boy, you need it.
708
lf l'm not back in five,
you come looking, okay?
709
Barkeep, what you got?
710
-You got a problem with that?
-No. lt's just the way l like it:
711
Extra disgusting.
712
Three teams will move through
the cranial artery...
713
...and one through
the nasal passages.
714
We are going to the brain, baby.
And we are stealing one of these.
715
This sucker comes from a place
called the hypothalamus gland.
716
Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus.
717
Controls the temperature for the body.
718
We are going to march in
and take the prize.
719
Frank's gonna heat up
like a sidewalk on a summer day.
720
Go away.
721
l need to talk to you.
722
What a zit!
723
What is it? What do you want?
724
l want you to help me.
725
Should l call the cops?
726
Or maybe Shane should know
about the 200-yard restraining order.
727
Please. She's been
humiliated enough already.
728
Humiliated.
729
You turned me into
a walking air-sickness bag.
730
My family was humiliated.
You understand?
731
Do you have any idea
of the teasing...
732
...that my sons, Ralph and Chuck,
had to endure?
733
l know your daughter Hurly
had to transfer.
734
Her name is Shirley.
735
That is much prettier.
736
-Tom Brokaw called her Hurly.
-What?
737
But it was a cute picture.
738
We gotta get this water underneath
our bridge, for Shane's sake.
739
l would never hold anything
against one of my students.
740
Get back to work!
741
-Be prepared. lt's going down tonight.
-Tonight?
742
Me and Madcow
are going to Wrestlemania.
743
See this?
744
This DNA bead comes from a girl
in Riverside, California.
745
Didn't like to wash her hands.
Took me three whole weeks.
746
And this one.
Nice lady in Detroit, Motown.
747
Six days flat.
748
Then there's this old guy in Philly.
749
l killed him in seventy-two hours.
750
l'm getting better as l go, but
the problem is l never set a record.
751
Until my man Frank, that is.
752
l'll take him down in 48 hours.
Get my chapter in the medical books.
753
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l got one more question here.
754
Could a white blood cell
do anything to stop this evil plan?
755
You know, hypothetically speaking,
that is.
756
-And, who are you?
-Who am l? Who am l?
757
A bad, booty-shaking pickinosis.
Yeah. That's who l am.
758
-Never heard of you.
-You just got here.
759
But ask any of them,
when it comes to illing...
760
...bad, booty-shaking pickinosis
stands above the rest.
761
Oh, that hurts.
762
That ain't no germ.
763
That's a cop.
764
Well, what do we have here?
An officer of Frank's finest.
765
Somebody lay down a towel.
This is going to be messy.
766
Attention, germs. You are surrounded.
767
Surrounded.
768
Yo, Hammer. You can stop dancing.
769
What kept you?
770
Es el muerte rojo!
771
No me mates!
Get out of here!
772
Please lift the restraining order...
773
...so l can do this
father-daughter trip.
774
The answer is no.
775
Please.
776
Think about it overnight.
777
lt would make a little girl
very happy.
778
Only for use against
the most stubborn cold symptoms.
779
-Childproof caps.
-Get him!
780
Why you hit so hard?
781
Drix, l could use a little help here.
782
Give me that.
783
Oh, no. Not again.
784
You have something white on your lips.
785
Other side.
786
Get out!
787
Out!
788
The answer is no! Absolutely not!
789
Thanks. You saved my cytoplasm
in there.
790
Mr. Thrax has left the building.
791
Let's call for a scab
and get to the precinct.
792
Jones! In my offiice.
793
Hey, hey, who died?
Other than Thrax, that is. Brandy!
794
-l mean, Leah. Why are you here?
-You really did it now.
795
-l didn't see you back there.
-Disregarding orders, destruction...
796
...popping a pimple without a permit!
What were you doing there?
797
-Promoting good health, sir.
-ls that what you call it?
798
He was lethal.
lf we hadn't stopped him--
799
-We'd be frying eggs off of Frank!
-Watch it, you'll cause a panic.
800
People would think
about what's going on in this body...
801
...not the stupid trip!
802
Okay, you want us to start thinking?
Well, here's a thought:
803
You're fired.
804
-Mr. Mayor--
-Your badge, mister.
805
Figures. l finally do something right
for Frank, and l get fired.
806
Without him, Frank could've been
in mortal danger.
807
Mortal danger? You'd love to prove
that, wouldn't you, Mr. Drixenol?
808
Get your name in the
New England Journal ofMedicine.
809
Son, read what it says on your arm.
810
''For the temporary relief
of symptoms--''
811
Exactly. Temporary.
812
You're a wannabe. A placebo.
813
A generic brand.
An over-the-counter Tic-Tac.
814
Now, get out of my body!
815
Continuing symptoms,
while annoying...
816
... will not derailplans
for the trip to the annual...
817
...chicken wing festival.
818
-What's so funny?
-l don't know.
819
They're making this too easy.
820
You know, no one has ever
gotten wise to me...
821
...and now for the first time...
822
...an immunity cell
has figured out everything...
823
...and they don't believe him.
824
Can you taste the irony in that?
825
Shut up! What are you two laughing at?
826
We're back on schedule.
827
But boss, we're the only ones left.
828
Maybe we should incubate for a while?
829
You incubate.
830
l'm going to make my deadline.
831
Medical books aren't written
about losers.
832
l'm not going.
833
-You're not going where, hon?
-To Buffalo. l'm not going.
834
Honey, we're all packed.
Buffalo's going to be a blast.
835
l'm going camping with my friends.
836
You're welcome to join us.
837
Well, l don't think....
838
l'd really like you to come.
839
You don't want me
huffing and puffing after you.
840
You want to go, okay.
841
Uncle Bob will go with me to Buffalo.
842
l'm tired of this. lt's not fair.
843
l go where you want.
l eat what you want.
844
Don't you ever think
about anyone else?
845
l think about you.
846
Like when you packed me
a fried Slim Jim sandwich?
847
Yeah. lt was a turkey Slim Jim.
848
You know, Dad....
849
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...
850
...and took care of yourselves...
851
...maybe she'd still be here.
852
lKnock off that hamburger talk.
Come here, honey.
853
Your mom died...
854
...because she got sick.
855
And how do you think you get sick?
856
Germs.
857
lt's the way you eat.
858
Who's that?
859
You know my great-great-grandpappy
fought the measles?
860
There's been a Jones on the force
since we came on the umbilical cord.
861
Until now, that is.
862
All right, ladies.
Wrap it up now.
863
Well, l....
l guess l should get going.
864
Wouldn't want Frank
to build immunity to me.
865
Maybe next time he takes Drixenol
it'll do him some good.
866
-Goodbye, Drips.
-That's Drix.
867
Whatever.
868
People, let's get started.
869
l don't need to remind anyone
that today's our trip to Buffalo.
870
Frank will be up in 20 minutes.
l don't want him losing an eyelash...

...or stubbing his toe.
872
Free screening?
873
We're broadcasting live dreams
from the brain's subconscious.
874
You get back to work right now.

-Perfect.
880
You can't come in here!

883
Don't forget the cushion

884
Don't want the voters
in the hemorrhoids complaining.
885
Something's wrong with the weather.
886
-We're probably drinking coffee.
-Look at the map.
887
-What if Jones is right?
-Jones?
888
Funny. Funny.
889
You care more about your reelection...
890
...than our lives.
891

to check it out.
892
Hypo-who-what is this?
893
Leah, wait!
Who will answer the phones?
894

895
Sarge?
896
Nothing down there but bad dreams.
897
Frankie.
898
Wait.
899
Maybe Shane would like to know
about the 200-yard restraining order.
900
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...
901
...and took care of yourselves...
902
-...maybe she'd still be here.
-You're fiired. Get out ofhere!
903

927
Hey, pal, are you on or off?
928
Fine. Flush your life

929
The zipper's down.
All ashore that's going ashore.
930

You want this chain so bad...
1032
...Big Daddy Thrax
is gonna let you have it.
1033
Looks good on you, Jones.
1034
You wear it well.
1035
lt's a shame you came

1036
Who's the Germinator now?

1039
Too bad you won't be here

1048
Hey! Wait!
1049
Frank!
1050
Frank!
1051
Things are grim as temperatures
rise dangerously.
1052
We've lost contact
with the extremities.
1053
NNN will stay on the air
as long as possible.
1054
When we return, household appliances
that can improve your golfswing.
1055
You silly twit, don't you get it?!
We are going to die!
1056
I knew it. At the fiirst dark cloud,

Your mama says, ''Hi.''
1075
As temperatures stabilize, a
grateful city salutes Osmosis Jones.
1076
The offiicer who saved us.
1077
Jones has been reinstated
to the force with fullprivileges.
1078
Ozzy, can l count on you
