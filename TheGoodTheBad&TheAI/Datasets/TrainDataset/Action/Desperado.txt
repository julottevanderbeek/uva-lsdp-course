What do you want?
Beer.
All I got is piss-warm Chango.
That's my brand.
This is good.
This is the best beer I've ever had.
Actually...
Need anything?
I'm just glad to be alive.
I was up a few towns away.
You know Saragosa?
I was visiting a bar there like this.
They serve beer.
Not this good, but close.
I saw something you wouldn't believe.
I'm sitting there by myself.
Now, this bar
was full of real lowlifes.
Not like this place.
No, I mean bad.
Like they were up to no good.
Anyway, I'm by myself.
I like it that way.
Meanwhile, things are going on.
Under-the-table kinds of things.
Not too obvious...
but not too secret either.
So I'm sitting there...
and in walks...
the biggest Mexican I have ever seen,
big as shit.
Walks in like he owns the place.
Nobody knew what to make of him
or what to think.
There he was, and in he walked.
He was dark, too.
I don't mean dark-skinned.
This was different.
It was as if he was always walking
in a shadow.
Every step he took toward the light,
when you thought you'd see his face...
it wasn't.
It was as if the lights dimmed
just for him.
So, this guy...
takes a seat at the bar...
asks the bartender for a soda,
says nothing.
He ordered a soda?
I wasn't interested in his drink.
I was more interested
in what he was carrying...
when he walked in,
some sort of a suitcase, heavy.
He sat that thing beside him
as if it were his girl.
Then, all of a sudden,
the bastard spoke.
He talked low to the bartender.
I knew he was talking business
because it upset the bartender.
Especially when he mentioned...
He said something like...
"bitch" or "Bucho."
That's what it was.
Bucho.
Whatever he said
pissed off the bartender.
Some of those unsavory characters...
not class acts like these boys,
but real scum, got pissed too.
Started pulling guns and knives,
starting some shit.
The stranger...
he bolts out of his bar stool,
grabs his case and dives into the room.
I don't know what he does on the floor,
but in two shakes the suitcase opens...
and he's pulled out the biggest
hand cannon I've ever fucking seen.
That was just the beginning.
You stood there while this went down?
You didn't run for cover or join in?
I was frozen stiff.
All I could do was watch this...
thing tear the place apart.
It was amazing.
Cutthroat scumbags...
were coming out of the woodwork
and dying much-deserved deaths.
Don't get me wrong.
This was no class-act group
like you got here.
Not at all.
These guys were world-class turds.
I'm sorry,
but they got what they deserved.
It was Judgment Night.
He grabs one of these guys...
the only guy still breathing.
He starts getting information from him.
I knew by the whispering...
this guy was giving up
all the goods.
Spilling his guts. Confessing the world.
He told that stranger everything.
Everything?
Can I get a cleaner mug?
This one's dirty.
Fuck you!
It's the cleanest one I got.
So anyway...
without warning,
without any hint or preview...
the stranger whips around...
and he sees...
me.
You saw his face?
His face?
His eyes.
- He didn't do anything to you?
- Not really.
Because he turned his attention back
to the guy on the floor.
The stranger shot him...
walked to the bartender,
paid and left.
So the bartender lived?
The bartender never gets killed!
But as the stranger neared the door...
No, man, the bartender
got it worse than anybody.
Here. It's on the house...
if you can remember his face.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I'm clearing out of here, boys...
'cause I think he's headed this way.
Thank you!
You all take care.
Who is it?
It's your only friend.
Don't you think you're being
a little too cautious?
One day, you'll lay down too hard
on that and blow your brains out.
What do you want?
He's there.
I mentioned his name
and they freaked.
Bucho's there?
One second they weren't listening
to a word I said...
but as soon as I mentioned him,
they couldn't hear enough.
And suddenly they got very interested
in who you were.
I laid the story down
nice and thick.
How thick?
Pretty thick.
- You were the biggest Mexican I'd seen.
- Wonderful.
I blew it out of proportion,
but they bought it.
They're shitting bricks.
I promise.
Where do I go?
Tarasco Bar's a start.
Try and keep it from turning into
a fucking bloodbath like last time.
That wasn't my fault.
- Of course not.
- They started it.
Whatever. Just remember,
Bucho's the one you want.
He's got plenty of underlings.
But without them, he's as good as dead.
- Save your bullets.
- Suddenly, you're my big brother.
I do feel some responsibility
for you.
- May I ask you something?
- Yeah.
What happens when he's dead?
When Bucho's dead...
it's over.
He's the last one.
End of payback? An eye for an eye
and all that crap? You'll be satisfied?
I think so.
I hope so.
I don't have the stomach
for this anymore.
You never did.
Neither did you.
I just called the Oro Verde Bar
in Saragosa.
There was no answer.
Let me know if you hear anything.
Okay. Bye.
I want a close lookout
on all operations.
That means double and triple checking,
even our regular customers.
I'll handle it.
Where is my car? Is it finished?
How long must I wait?
- I didn't like it so I sent it back.
- Again? I could've built it myself.
- What's this?
- It's my sister's nephew.
He's looking for work so he wanted
to show you his fighting abilities.
What? You call this an audition,
fighting against Pipon?
If he can't beat Cristos,
I'm not interested. Cristos, get in.
Get out.
He doesn't look special.
Kick his ass, Cristos!
That's more like it.
He'll never dance again.
- So much for Cristos.
- Told you.
Yeah, yeah. Listen.
This is what I want you to do.
Place extra men around
the Tarasco Bar and La Asteca.
These Colombians are wondering
if I can handle the extra volume.
They're watching us enough as it is.
- Say...
- What?
And him?
Cast that leg,
and welcome to the family.
I have a house payment.
Excuse me, but...
I used to work in a bar, so I know
what it's like to wait on people.
I want to bring to your attention
that the service here...
needs immediate improvement.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Our waiter, where is he?
Don't tell me he's still
in the bathroom.
Our waiter never came back to see
if we wanted anything else. We did.
He never brought us our check.
We wanted it
so we could get the hell out.
Here. This should be sufficient.
And don't be expecting a tip.
If you don't treat me good,
I won't ask you out.
Your beer tastes like piss.
- We know!
- Because we piss in it!
That's not all.
Bad beer, bad service.
Don't people know not to come in here?
Two cervezas.
These are for you.
This will just take a minute.
I wanted to see the guitar.
Do you play?
Yes. Do you?
A little bit.
Play something.
Not right now.
This is my father's,
but he doesn't play anymore.
No?
There's not much work for a mariachi.
He just watches TV.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was never that good anyway.
Not as good as I'm going to be.
Listen to this.
Loosen your fingers.
Like this.
You know what I mean?
Loosen them up.
How do you do that?
All right.
Give me this.
Forget this hand.
You want to get faster.
Here's the secret.
Got it? Good.
Practice this...
every day.
All day.
Next time...
I'll show you how to play a tune
using what you've learned.
Practice.
This reminds me of a joke.
This guy comes into a bar.
Walks up to the bartender.
Says, "Bartender, I got a bet for you.
I'll bet you $300 that I can piss...
into that glass
and not spill a single drop."
This glass is ten feet away.
He says, "Let me get this straight.
You'll bet me $300...
that you can piss standing here...
way over there into that glass
and not spill a single drop?"
The guy says, "That's right."
The bartender says,
"Young man, you got a bet."
The guy goes, "Okay, here we go."
Pulls out his thing.
He's looking at the glass.
He's thinking about the glass.
Dick, glass.
Thinking about his dick.
Dick, glass. Dick, glass.
Be the glass. Dick, glass.
And then he lets it rip.
And he's pissing all over the place.
He's pissing on the bar,
the stools, the floor...
the phone, the bartender.
He's pissing everywhere
except the fucking glass.
Right?
So, the bartender is laughing
his fucking ass off. He's $300 richer.
Piss dripping off his face.
He says, "You fucking idiot! You got it
in everything except the glass.
You owe me $300, punta."
The guy goes, "Excuse me one second."
Goes in the back of the bar.
In the back, a couple guys playing pool.
He walks over to them.
Comes back to the bar.
Goes, "Here you go, Mr. Bartender.
$300."
The bartender's like...
"Why are you so happy?
You just lost $300, idiot!"
The guy says,
"See those guys there?
I just bet them $500 apiece...
that I could piss on your bar...
on your floor, on your phone
and piss on you...
and not only would you not be mad
about it...
you'd be happy."
That's funny shit!
"You'd be happy about it!"
Guess what?
He didn't check out.
And you...
you checked out just fine.
Well, I knew I would because...
me and Bucco we go way back.
Him, too.
And this guy, I just met him today.
- Go in.
- Good work, by the way.
Good work. It's nice to see you
cross the I's and dot the T's here.
It's cool, ese.
Lead the way, Jorge.
In there?
That's fucking disgusting.
What do you want?
I'm looking for work.
No work here.
I see.
Something to drink?
Something in the guitar case?
Yeah.
What?
My guitar.
Are you sure you don't want to hear
me play before you say there is no work?
We want to see what's in the case.
If it's what you say,
you can drink all you want.
But I told you already.
I'm a musician.
This is my guitar.
Don't touch it!
Get him away.
Hurry up!
How you doing?
- What is it?
- It's a guitar.
It's a guitar.
We heard stories
of a guitar case full of guns.
I know.
- Had to make sure.
- I understand.
It's him!
Yes, it's me.
I'm not against you guys,
so keep it down.
I'm just looking for a man
who calls...
Not yet.
What's going on?
Is that now?
- Watch him.
- What's going on?
Friends of yours?
I swear I have no fucking idea
what the hell's going on!
Shit!
You missed me!
Get up.
Come here.
I'm looking for a man
who calls himself Bucho.
That's all.
But you had to do it the hard way.
Listen to me.
I don't want to kill you.
I just want you to take me to him.
Understand?
You like to shoot me in the back?
Fucker!
If you want to go, go.
If you want to stay...
Relax, okay?
Fuck you!
Look at you now.
The money's still in the back.
So is the pickup.
Pick-up Guy's lying on the floor
with three bullets in his head.
- Tavo must have shot him.
- Where's Tavo?
- Tavo's outside, boss.
- Where?
Two blocks up.
Tell him to get his ass over here!
- I want to know what happened.
- He's dead.
I'll tell you, boss...
whoever it was,
didn't come looking for the money.
No. They came looking for me.
You've heard stories about the man who
carries a guitar case full of weapons.
Those are stories.
That's all they are.
Can't you see
we are fucking closed?
We must find him.
- You said the Colombians watch us.
- We must move quickly.
He's probably left town.
He knows I'm here.
He's not going anywhere.
Where am I?
Where am I?
Bookstore.
Bookstore Cafe.
What the hell did you give me?
Painkillers.
I'm operating.
Where is everybody?
I closed early so no one could come.
No one would come anyway.
- Why?
- Nobody reads.
Is it yours? All those books?
It's mine.
My parents passed away.
They left me the building and money.
I have an apartment upstairs.
Why a bookstore?
This town never had a bookstore...
so I get this bright idea.
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?
Why a bookstore?
All right.
Isn't there a hospital?
Trust me. You don't want to go
to a hospital here.
You'll never find work
in this town.
What?
The guitar.
Nobody hires musicians around here.
I know.
I use it to pick up girls.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Come on!
See this?
That had your name on it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You don't know my name.
- That's right.
I don't know your name.
You smoke?
It's the least I can do for you
after saving my life.
Have a couple more.
Painkillers.
Hot water.
Shit!
What do you do to me?
- I'm sorry.
- You're crazy.
Relax.
This is the cold water.
Better?
Let's stitch you up.
Get out of here.
I know who you are.
Really?
You're that guy
you always hear stories about.
- You kill drug dealers.
- I'm looking for Bucho. Know him?
I hope you don't think
you can take Bucho alone.
- You know him?
- Yeah.
I have a few friends I can call.
They owe me a favor.
Don't complain.
That would be straight
if you hadn't been moving so much.
That one's worse.
Who did that one?
I did a long time ago.
I don't even want to know
what that is.
Well, saved my life more than once.
- You can have it.
- Oh, no. Thanks.
No. I'm okay.
Will you help me?
I don't think I can help you.
I need to leave my things here
for a few minutes.
- I can trust you?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right.
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to church.
- What for?
- Confess my sins.
I'm a sinner.
I know.
Did I thank you?
No, you didn't.
I will.
Bucho, what do you think?
Bulletproof windows, sidings...
the hood.
Just what you asked for.
Listen.
There are no pickups scheduled today
except one in Hidalgo.
Stay away from there.
The rest of the town is game.
Take this car and find him!
- I'll take my truck.
- Take the car. That's why I bought it.
If you see someone you don't know,
kill him. I can't take more chances.
Sunroof is bulletproof. Works as a
shield for when they shoot from the top.
Look at this guy.
It works. Now go and get him.
Zamira.
Take her with you.
You'll need all the help you can get.
You, too.
Bless me, Father,
for I have just killed quite a few men.
No shit!
From what I hear, you cleaned out
the entire Tarasco Bar.
Nice job, asshole. Every hit man
in Cahilla's looking for you.
- Things got out of hand.
- I told you, no more bloodbaths.
I told you, Bucho's the last one.
- After him, I'm finished.
- No, I'm finished.
They killed the woman you loved. Okay.
Then they shot through your hand.
Two points. Wake up.
There is no payback for that.
Walk away.
Trust me. This is one you're not
going to want to see through to the end.
What do you mean?
Let's just say, I've done some checking.
Bucho is not someone to mess with.
Trust me.
I cannot leave without Bucho.
You don't expect to live much longer?
Fine. I do.
Seriously. You need
any more help, don't call me.
Call your friends Campa and Quino.
They're crazy.
I should be able
to count on you! You!
Those days are gone.
Wait! Come on!
Good luck. Don't get shot.
Did you want confession?
Maybe later, Father,
because where I am going...
I'd just have to come right back.
Hello.
Yeah?
Look...
I didn't call about it before
because I could handle it.
Yes, he's got no place to go.
I got my men on him right now.
What do you mean you brought someone in?
How long has he been here?
Who is he?
What are you talking about?
We can handle it.
Someone like that will tear the place up
and make a lot of noise.
What does your guy look like?
I've got to know or the wrong people
might get killed.
Next time I'll call you sooner,
but I knew I could handle this so...
Hello? Hello!
Shit!
What's the number
to the phone in my car?
Fuckheads, what's the number
to the phone in my car?
Number!
It's in your car, boss.
What is the fucking number
to the phone in my car?
Fuck!
What are you doing? Get away.
You can't go away. I need you.
