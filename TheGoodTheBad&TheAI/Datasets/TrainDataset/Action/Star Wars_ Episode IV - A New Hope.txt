Did you hear that?
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness.
We're doomed.
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.
What's that?
R2-D2, where are you?
At last!
Where have you been?
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel...
smashed into who knows what!
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions.
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship...
where is the ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans...
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!
There's one. Set for stun.
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.
You'll be deactivated for sure.
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher...
you overweight glob of grease!
Now come out before
somebody sees you.
Secret mission?
What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.
I'm going to regret this.
There goes another one.
Hold your fire.
There's no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Oh.
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic...
Don't act so surprised,
Your Highness.
You weren't on any
mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate...
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.
Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.
If word of this gets out...
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.
I've traced the rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.
Send a distress signal...
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.
Lord Vader,
the battle station plans...
are not aboard this ship...
and no transmissions were made.
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting...
but no life forms were aboard.
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve
them... See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.
Yes, sir.
How did we get into this mess?
I really don't know how.
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.
What a desolate place this is!
Where do you think you're going?
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.
What makes you think...
there are settlements over there?
Don't get technical with me.
What mission?
What are you talking about?
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.
You'll be malfunctioning within a day...
you nearsighted scrap pile.
And don't let me catch you
following me begging for help...
because you won't get it.
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.
He tricked me into going this way...
but he'll do no better.
Wait! What's that?
A transport.
I'm saved!
Over here!
Hey!
Hey!
Help! Please help!
R2?
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.
Look, sir, droids.
We stopped.
Wake up! Wake up!
We're doomed.
Do you think they'll melt us down?
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Will this never end?
All right, fine. Let's go.
Woman: Luke! Luke!
Luke, tell Uncle
if he gets a translator...
be sure it speaks Bocce.
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.
-
- Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.
Protocol? Why, it's
my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...
I have no need for a protocol droid.
Of course you haven't, sir.
Not in an environment such as this.
That is why I have
been programmed...
What I really need is
a droid who understands...
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.
Very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.
Can you speak Bocce?
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me...
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.
Luke!
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?
I want them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Tosche Station...
to pick up some power converters.
You can waste time
with your friends...
when your chores are done.
Now come on. Get to it.
All right. Come on.
And the red one. Come on.
Well, come on, red. Let's go.
Uncle Owen!
Yeah?
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?
Excuse me, sir...
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.
Uncle Owen, what about that one?
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.
Take this away.
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.
O.K. Let's go.
Now, don't you forget this.
Why I should stick
my neck out for you...
is quite beyond my capacity.
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination...
I can barely move.
It just isn't fair.
Oh, Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Is there anything I might do to help?
No. Not unless you can alter time...
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm only a droid...
and not very knowledgeable
about such things...
not on this planet, anyway.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's
a bright centre to the universe...
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
You can call me Luke.
I see, Sir Luke.
Ha ha.
Just Luke.
Oh... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.
Hello.
You got a lot of carbon scoring.
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through...
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are...
what with the rebellion and all.
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!
That's how we came
to be in your service...
if you take my meaning, sir.
Have you been in many battles?
Several, I think.
Actually, there's not much to tell.
I'm not much more
than an interpreter...
and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.
Well, my little friend...
you got something jammed
in here real good.
Were you on a Starcruiser or...
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
What's this?
"What is what"?
He asked you a question.
What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?
She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.
A person of some importance, I believe.
Our captain was attached...
Is there any more
to this recording?
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...
a resident of these parts...
and it's a private message for him.
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.
But with all
we've been through...
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?
I don't know any Obi-Wan...
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt...
has short-circuited
his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.
Oh, yeah. Well...
I guess you're too small
to run away on me...
if I take this off.
O. K...
There you go.
Wait a minute.
Where'd she go?
Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.
"What message"?
The one you've just been playing!
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.
Woman: Luke! Luke!
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir...
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
No, I don't like you, either.
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.
What makes you think that?
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what
he's talking about?
Mm-mm.
I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That wizard's just a crazy old man.
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...
and have its memory erased.
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?
He won't.
I don't think he exists any more.
He died about the same time
as your father.
He knew my father?
I told you to forget it.
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...
working on those condensers.
Yes, sir.
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...
about me staying on another season?
And if these new droids
do work out...
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...
and then you can go
to the academy next year.
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.
But it's a whole 'nother year!
Look, it's only one more season.
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.
Where are you going?
Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Ooh!
What are you doing
hiding back there?
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
Kept babbling on about his mission.
Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
Blast it!
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait until morning.
Uncle Owen:
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.
Oh, he excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Luke?
Luke!
Luke!
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...
so he left early.
Did he take those
two new droids with him?
I think so.
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!
Hey, whoa! Where do
you think you're going?
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...
into a million pieces right here!
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.
Sandpeople, or worse.
Come on.
Let's go have a look.
Come on!
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.
Hello, there.
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.
Ben?
Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be travelled lightly.
Tell me, young Luke...
what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
I think he's searching
for his former master...
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.
He claims to be the property...
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who
he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
Oh, he's not dead.
Not yet.
You know him?
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...
since, oh, before you were born.
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled...
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand?
We've got to get out of here before
the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.
I'm done for.
Luke: No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.
Thought he should
have stayed here...
and not gotten involved.
You fought in the Clone Wars?
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...
the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...
and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become...
quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this...
when you were old enough...
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...
like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...
I'll close down for a while.
Sure. Go ahead.
What is it?
It's your father's lightsabre.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations...
the Jedi knights were the guardians...
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...
before the dark times...
before the Empire.
How did my father die?
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader...
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and
murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created
by all living things.
It surrounds us, penetrates us...
it binds the galaxy together.
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...
and where you come from.
I saw part of a message he was...
I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him...
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.
But my ship has fallen under attack...
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information...
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.
My father will know
how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid...
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
You must learn
the ways of the Force...
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to get home.
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
It's all such a long way from here.
That's your uncle talking.
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.
Until this battle station
is fully operational...
we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous
than you realize.
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...
not to this battle station.
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...
in the Imperial Senate...
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.
I have just received word...
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants
of the old Republic...
have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors
now have direct control...
over their territories.
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...
fear of this battle station.
And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained...
a complete technical readout
of this station...
it is possible, however unlikely...
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...
would be a useless gesture...
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud...
of this technological terror
you've constructed.
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...
next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...
or given you
clairvoyance enough...
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...
by the time this station
is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion...
with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.
It's just, I've never heard of them...
hitting anything this big before.
They didn't...
but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file...
to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points,
too accurate...
for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?
If they traced the robots here...
they may have learned
who they sold them to...
and that would lead
them back... home!
Wait, Luke!
It's too dangerous!
Uncle Owen!
Aunt Beru!
Uncle Owen!
And now, Your Highness...
we will discuss the location...
of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...
had you been there.
You'd have been killed, too...
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn
the ways of the Force...
and become a Jedi
like my father.
Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
How long have you
had these droids?
Three or four seasons.
They're up for sale
if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see
his identification.
We don't need to see
his identification.
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
You can go about your business.
Move along.
Move along.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.
The Force can have
a strong influence...
on the weak-minded.
Do you really think we're
gonna find a pilot here...
that'll take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...
only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
What?
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
Uh...
I'll have one of those.
He doesn't like you.
I'm sorry.
I don't like you, either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
I'll be careful.
You'll be dead!
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
Aah!
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate...
on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you,
old man.
What's the cargo?
Only passengers...
myself, the boy...
two droids...
and no questions asked.
What is it, some kind
of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...
any imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
We don't have
to sit here and listen...
We can pay you 2,000 now...
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen, huh?
O.K. You guys got
yourselves a ship.
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest...
in your handiwork.
All right.
We'll check it out.
Those guys must really
be desperate.
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.
You'll have to sell your speeder.
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo.
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
It's too late.
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.
I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...
Jabba's through with you.
He has no time for smugglers...
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Han: Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
Greedo: That's the idea.
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.
I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?
Perhaps she would respond...
to an alternative
form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
I think it is time
we demonstrated...
the full power of this station.
Set your course for Alderaan.
With pleasure.
Lock the door, R2.
Check this side of the street.
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke...
than stay here with you.
I don't know what
all this trouble is about...
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.
You watch your language.
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Look at this.
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.
It'll be enough.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
Right here, Jabba.
I've been waitin' for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me...
and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.
Don't send one of these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions.
What if everyone who smuggled for me...
dropped their cargo at the first sign...
of an imperial starship?
It's not good business.
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.
You think I had a choice?
But I got a nice, easy charter.
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best.
So, for an extra 20%...
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
Okay, 15%.
But if you fail me again...
I'll put a price on your head so big...
you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.
Come on!
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...
we ought to do well.
What a piece of junk!
She'll make.5 past light speed.
She may not look like much...
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board...
we'll get outta here.
Hello, sir.
Which way?
All right, men,
load your weapons.
Stop that ship!
Blast them!
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.
Try and hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations...
for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try
and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough...
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!
Without precise calculations...
we'd fly right through a star...
or bounce too close
to a supernova...
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?
What's that flashing?
We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin.
I should have expected...
to find you holding Vader's leash.
I recognized your foul stench...
when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.
You don't know
how hard I found it...
signing the order
to terminate your life.
I'm surprised you had the courage...
to take the responsibility yourself.
Princess Leia,
before your execution...
I would like you to be my guest...
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin...
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.
In a way,
you have determined...
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.
Since you are reluctant...
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base...
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...
on your home planet of Alderaan.
No! Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...
You would prefer another target?
A military target?
Then name the system.
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.
Where is the rebel base?
Dantooine.
They're on Dantooine.
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.
What?
You're far too trusting.
Dantooine is too remote...
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.
No!
Commence primary ignition.
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...
as if millions of voices...
suddenly cried out in terror...
and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible
has happened.
You'd better get on
with your exercises.
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.
I told you I'd outrun them.
Don't everybody thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.
Now be careful, R2.
Argh!
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets...
when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.
Grrr...
I see your point, sir.
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.
Argh!
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.
You mean it controls your actions?
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.
Han: There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go
your conscious self...
and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.
How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.
Stretch out with your feelings.
You see? You can do it.
Han: I call it luck.
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.
Good against the living,
that's something else.
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.
That's good.
You've taken your first step...
into a larger world.
Yes?
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.
They found the remains
of a rebel base...
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.
She lied. She lied to us!
I told you she would never...
consciously betray the rebellion.
Terminate her immediately.
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.
What the...
Arrghh arrgh!
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It's not on any of the charts.
What's going on?
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.
What do you mean?
Where is it?
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.
What? How?
Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...
There's another ship coming in.
Maybe they know what happened.
It's an imperial fighter.
It followed us!
No. It's a short-range fighter.
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.
It would be as well to let it go.
It's too far out of range.
Not for long.
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...
to tell anybody about us.
Luke: Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.
Han: I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.
That's no moon.
It's a space station.
It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around.
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!
Luke: Why are we still
moving towards it?!
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!
There's got to be
something you can do!
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.
You can't win...
but there are alternatives
to fighting.
Clear Bay 327.
We are opening
the magnetic field.
To your stations!
Come with me.
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.
-
- Yes?
We've captured a freighter...
entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.
Its markings match
those of a ship...
that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.
Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.
It must be a decoy, sir.
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.
Did you find any droids?
No, sir.
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part
of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something...
a presence I've not felt since...
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.
I want every part
of this ship checked.
There's no one here.
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.
I use them for smuggling.
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off...
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.
Who's the more foolish...
the fool or the fool
who follows him?
Argh!
The ship's all yours.
If the scanners pick up anything...
report it immediately.
All right, let's go.
Han: Hey, down there!
Could you give us a hand
with this?
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?
TK-421, do you copy?
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.
Grrr!
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.
Bring them on!
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.
We've found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.
He says he's found
the main controls...
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor...
in seven locations.
A power loss
at one of the terminals...
will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.
Whatever you say.
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.
I want to go with you.
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.
They must be delivered safely...
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.
The Force will be with you always.
