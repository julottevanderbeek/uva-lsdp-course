I do not feel safe anymore.
Hello?
Every time he calls,
playing the same tune.
Evergreen Academy.
Ring any bells?
The private school I went to.
It was weird. I can not find anything.
Here is something.
- Who is Edwina Burke?
- She was my school principal.
I drank fřrhen. Very much.
I did too.
On top of a lot of shit.
This evening, I was close on
to take a sprřjte again.
I'm glad you're here.
Hello, you miss Burke?
Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?
Can we talk for a
of your former students?
Joe Doucett.
- Come on in..
- I hope not to bother you.
I was making tea.
Sit down though.
Joseph Doucett?
- Remember him?
- Of course.
He is the only killer in the
motley bunch of students.
And if I told you
Joe Doucett is innocent?
The fact that another man killed her.
One he knew from Evergreen.
- Tell me first who you are.
- I'm sorry.
My name is Marie Sebastian.
Have you heard about the innocence project?
They work dreamed convicts.
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.
Excuse me for a moment.
Do you believe that it was not he?
There have sprung up evidence that suggests
that he was blamed for it.
It comes as a great relief.
He was a really nice guy.
Donna adored him, but he
vćrdsatte neither it or her.
He was tall thoughts about themselves.
But others are not.
He could even be malicious.
Always with a smile, as if the
was a joke.
I saw him a bit like a
lost soul.
You nćvnte the killer
was another student?
- I suspect that Joe had enemies?
- Yes, many.
But to do something sĺdant would krćve
something quite unusual...
Yes, but was there any?
Can you get on one?
I can not think of one.
I drove past your old school.
- What happened to it?
- They took it from me.
My father built the school.
Stone on stone.
Board sold it to a company.
Since that time the gates closed.
Everything is still there. Records, files.
All of the school's history.
- But it has left.
- Goodbye.
Marie?
At the beginning of our conversation?
There you said that Joe is innocent.
Not "was innocent."
I assumed he was dead.
Thank you.
Did you go to school here?
It's been a long time.
Let's get back tonight.
- Hello?
- I have no idea who it is.
The name tells me nothing.
- What about your classmates?
- Oh, I have not seen in years.
As if assholes want to talk to me.
In addition to you, I hated every one.
- Sorry, Joe.
- Do not mention it.
I'm trying to figure something out.
I'll call again.
We should change your dressing.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, thank you.

If he kills you,
you will never see your daughter.
And you kill him,
you still will not see your daughter.
Pull over not up to him.
I have no choice.
Please.
I do not want you drive.
Listen.
Promise me that you are not going anywhere.

Do you expect here?
Promise?

As I said, I am a man,

- You know nothing about my father.
He knew no fear.
Only for love.
Arthur Pryce was a great man.
And will always be a great man.
What we shared with each other -
- was wonderful, skřnt. And clean.
My father did what he did
to honor and preserve...
Father...
Father.
And he loved me.
You see, Joseph, -
- my sister and I thought that we
had with our father, would last forever.
And that no one could take that away from us.
But it was just exactly what you did.
And yes... -
- Therefore I spćrrede you for 20 years.
It seems
that you have won, Doucett.
- Take me to Mia.
- Yes, of course.
Do you know what I find fascinating
, Joseph?
You have always been avoiding making
the most fundamental questions:
Why did I let you go?
Watch your head.
Welcome to one of the TV series,
that have survived in allerlćngst time -
- even if it only had a single viewer:
You.
Neither her mother or Doucett
had family, so we were lucky...
-  Blessed.
- Yes, it was a blessing...
Is not that astonishing?
People believe everything they see on television.
Thank you, Ashley. You can walk again.
Joseph?
No. No. Mia?
Mia!
Mia!
Oh, Joseph. It's not your daughter.
Ashley is a musician,
and a well-paid actor -
- who has been employed by me
since she was ten years old.
I wish you could see you p ..
No more Christmas games!
Tell me where she's gone!
Answer the question,
you have never asked.
Why I let you loose?
Tell me. Tell me that.
You know the answer, Joseph.
Deep in your heart, you know
-
- the simple truth.
- Say hello to the camera.
- Hello.
It took a while -
- to change her name -
- and her records.
Finding the right parents.
A insensitive mother -
- and a loving father who was
taken from her too soon.
It took me twenty years to create her.
A fřlsom and caring woman -
- who aspired to help people in distress, -
- because she had overcome -
- an enormously sřrgelig past.
A woman
could not do otherwise -
- but to fall in love with a man
like you -
- Joseph Doucett.
No! No!
Oh dear God! No!
CALLING

Please, help it with
make her hurt.
Do me hurt instead.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Please, kill me.
I will not kill you, Joseph.
This is the reason why I let you free.
So I could experience this moment
with you.
So you could fully understand,
what I had, -
- and what you took from me.
Now that I am free, -
- the rest is silence.
- and I will vćrne on
the happiness forever."
" Do not waste a minute of your life
trying to think of me. "
" I wish, You must be together
but one that cares for you, -
-  fit on you,
and skćnker you joy, -
- along with a good man
with a good heart."
