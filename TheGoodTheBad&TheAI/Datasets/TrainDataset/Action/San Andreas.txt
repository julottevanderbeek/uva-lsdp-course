The San Fernando Valley,
You're killing me, girl... what
happened with you and Josh?
Help!
So... I understand that you all were
part of the 58th Rescue Squadron
staged over at Bagram in Afghanistan
Combat, Search and Rescue.
Yes ma'am.
And yet still flying together?
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there.
We wouldn't want to break up the family.
Dude, do we look like a family?
A little.
So what is the biggest difference
between rescuing over there...
and what you do here?
Not getting shot at.
You're a funny guy.
Yeah, exactly.
Cute not bright.
Chief Gaines.
I'm told that between Afghanistan and LFD...
you have over 600 documented rescues.
That's uh...
pretty impressive.
Just doing my job, ma'am.
I go where they tell me to go.
That's great.
Cut the...
There she is.
Looks pretty tight.
Take her up.
Metro, this is LFD helo 5,
we're on cedar cliff V rescue.
- We have visual.
What's the girl's name?
Natalie.
Metro, connect her cell to our Sat phone.
Hello.
Natalie, this is chief pilot Raymond Gaines,
from the Los Angeles Fire Department
I'm piloting the chopper above you.
You holding up alright?
I don't know.
I'm not feeling very well.
Oh my god!
The car is sliding.
Natalie, I'm gonna need
you to stay calm honey.
-
- Okay.
Ray, I don't see a way in.
We're going to tip the hat.
- Tip the hat?
- Yeah.
You might want to hold on to something.
Here we go.
Whoa!
Go easy Ray.
Rise and shine.
Alright.
Tuck it in, boys.
Joby, forget the basket.
We got to do a double tie-in
on this time.
If that car goes, so does she.
On the skid.
We got 5 minutes max.
What happens in 5 minutes?
No! Don't.
Natalie, do not move!
Oh my god.
Get me out of here.
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.
I have to stabilize the car, okay?
Hurry, please.
Hoist secured.
Got it.
What the hell?
Shit.
Oh, no.
Jesus.
Joby's pinned.
Oh, god damn it.
Joby.
I'm coming down.
Harrison, you're flying.
- Marcus, rig me a rope.
- Alright.
- Handing over.
- Taking over.
- Get ready to cut.
- Roger that.
Hooked up.
Out the door.
Natalie, don't you worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here...
This thing isn't going to hold!
Ray, we are in red.
We're going to crash.
Natalie, we're going now!
Okay, I got you.
Cut it!
Cutting sling!
Yeah.
What do you say we get you home now?
I think that's a really good idea.
California Institute of Technology
Now, the Sendai quake in Japan
was considered to be one of the
It was so powerful in fact that
it moved to the main island of Japan...
This is just...
that occur around the globe each year
The largest ever recorded
here in North America.
Anchorage, Alaska - 1964,
a 9.1
The earth shook for 5 straight minutes.
The energy released was the
equivalent of 10 million atom bombs
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.
And that's not the biggest
earthquake ever recorded.
No.
The biggest was 4 years eariler.
Off the coast of Valdivia,
in southern Chile,
a 9.5 on the Richter scale.
Right there.
Bam.
This quake lasted 11 minutes.
And spawned a tsunami 82 feet high
that leveled Hilo-Hawaii,
So...
uh...
It's...
It's mass destruction like this...
that shows how important that the
research we are doing here... is.
Because we need to be able
to predict these things.
Right?
To plan and prepare for them.
Yes, ma'am.
Professor, do you think something
that intense can happen here?
Well, the San Andreas Fault
runs up the spine of California.
That's the demarcation line
between 2 tectonic plates that are...
constantly moving.
Add to that, the fact that
it's suppose to happen every 150 years.
And we're about 100 years overdue.
I say it's not a matter of "if".
It's a matter of when?
Damn, Godzilla. What the hell
did you do to her this time?
Played a little tug or war with.
How soon could you get her fixed?
I'll call Martinez today.
Get another one send over to maintenance.
Elgin, you move any faster,
you're going to break that hip.
Harrison said you're taking off
with Blake for a few days.
Yeah, leaving tomorrow.
Driving back up to school.
Volleyball team has her
first game this weekend.
So I figure we cruise up
the coast and go camping.
Dude, I can't believe
she's in college already.
I know.
Too fast brother.
- I'll catch you inside.
- Alright.
CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY
- Lawrence, I got to show you something.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Jesus.
Now we got a rare low level seismic
swarming out from Falcon, Nevada.
All tiny 2 to 2.6.
In the last 24 hours.
Where the hell is Falcon, Nevada?
- 5 miles from Hoover Dam.
- Fine.
There aren't any faults out there.
Any known faults.
Now if we get there while
the mini quakes continue.
We can test our theory.
And if the magnetic pulse rate
goes up before the quakes...
- And we'll predict them now.
- And we'll predict them now.
Alright.
Let's go check it out.
- Hey, sweetie.
I was wondering if there's room for my bike?
I thought that I could ride it to class,
and I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.
It is a great idea.
I'm sure I could figure out
a way to fit it in.
Alright, great. I can't find
the key to the lock at mom's, so...
it's either in the top
left drawer of my dresser or...
Okay, no problem.
I'll find it.
I don't know If you have plans tonight
but I love to take you to dinner.
You can invite your mother along.
It'll be fun.
Thanks, Dad, but we already
have plans with Daniel.
Dad.
- Are you okay?
Totally cool.
No problem at all.
-
- Okay.
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.
- Bye, dad. I love you.
Bye.
DIVORCE PAPERS ATTACHED
Hoover Dam
Hoover Dam Clark County, Nevada
Lawrence, it's incredible.
This is the 3rd mini quake
since we've been here.
And the magnetic pulse rate is
increased before each one of them...
.
That was 2.2
Our model is predictive.
Finally we got it right, man.
Finally!
Yup, we sure did.
Shit.
What's wrong?
The pulse rates are spiking again.
They're huge.
We're about to have a major quake.
It jumped to a 7.1
Jesus, Kim.
Get the hell out of there!
Everybody, get off the dam!
Move, now! Now!
Go girls!
Go, go, go.
Everybody off!
Hurry up!
Stay behind the barriers!
Come on, run!
Stay behind the barriers.
Someone help!
Kim!
Hurry!
Come here.
I got you.
Come on, please.
Oh my god!
Kim!
Hurry up!
Lawrence!
No.
Kim!
No, no!
Close your eyes.
- Oh god.
- Mommy.
Chief Logan Large earthquake, Nevada...
Chief Logan Large earthquake, Nevada.
Call in immediately.
"The most destructive earthquake
ever reported in that area. "
Officials are saying that
Hoover Dam, is a total lost.
Lake Havasu City,
also suffered major damage.
Hi Dad.
- Hey, honey.
- I just saw the news.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
We're heading out tomorrow.
I get it. It sounds really bad, dad.
Yeah.
This one is tough.
Hey, Emm.
Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- Daniel.
- Ray. Good to finally meet you.
It's good to meet you too.
Heck of a place you got here, man.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
So... um.
Dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.
Oh, it's terrible what happened.
Please be safe with them, okay.
Yeah, we will. And I promise,
I will make it up to you honey.
Dad, it's really no problem.
The drive's not...
Wait, why don't I take you up there?
I'm flying up to San Francisco
for a meeting...
we can head up to Seattle right after.
It'll give me an opportunity to
catch your volleyball game.
Good idea.
And it'll give your mom
a chance to get all her stuff
and move in without me in the way.
Right you are.
You guys moving in?
Yeah, I... I was meaning to tell you,
but we didn't have a chance to...
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
That's great.
- Call me when you get there.
- I will.
- Alright.
- I love you, Dad.
- And becareful too.
- I will, I will. I love you too.
I'll get her bike.
I'm sorry you guys can't
go up there together.
Yeah, me too.
Ray.
Ray.
I was going to tell you.
We just decided to do it.
Don't worry about it.
- Hey, if you want...
- And I'll get those papers signed for you too.
Obviously, people weren't at work.
They were asleep.
Even so, the early devastation
has spared no...
This is bad.
Yeah.
What time we're heading out?
The guys are preping the gears now.
Alright.
Let's get to work.
...clearly sophisticated rescue
operations are on the way
So this Daniel guy is taking Blake now?
I would've call in sick.
Well, that's why I'm the boss
and you're not.
Oh, pretty sure we could
manage a few days without you.
- Shoes untied.
- Ha-ha-ha...
Are you kidding me.
Eah...
Blake.
I want you to know that I respect
what you and your dad have.
And to know your mom moving in
has to feel like a pretty big step.
But I'm never going to try and
change with what you have with him.
Or, take his place.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Hey, how come you never have kids?
Oh, I did.
This is one of them right here.
She's a pretty nice addition to
the San Francisco skyline.
Don't you think?
- The Gate
- Catchy.
Yeah, I like it.
Mom was telling me about this.
She said it's the tallest
building in the city, right?
When it's finished, it will be the tallest,
strongest and it's already 80% sold.
But honestly...
I guess I never had any kids because
I was always so busy raising these.
Oakland Municipal Airport
Mom texted, she's having
lunch with your sister today.
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days.
Emm really wanted to meet her.
I'm a little nervous though.
Susan can be kind of... overprotective.
Oh, thank you.
San Francisco
Jonathan.
- Morning, Mr. Riddick
- Morning.
- You're going to be okay, Blake?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
Hi.
Hello.
Sorry Lawrence.
Can I get you anything?
No.
I'm fine Alexi, thank you.
Are you sure you want to be here?
I can use the distraction, actually.
Yeah?
There's a reporter outside.
Says she's doing a segment in
what happened in Nevada.
Oh.
I'm going to her this is not a good time.
No, wait a minute.
Kim gave his life for this.
People need to know that
we can predict these things now.
You want a copy?
I've got a 1,000 in storage.
No one listens to us until
the ground shakes, I guess.
You know, they told me
what happened to your colleague.
You don't have to do this now.
Yeah, we do.
We're good to go.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Rolling.
First question: How come no one saw
what happened in Nevada coming?
Because we didn't know
there were any fault lines out there.
Why not?
Contrary to popular believes,
scientists don't know everything.
I understand that you publicly
stated that someday...
scientists would be able
to predict earthquakes.
Well actually, as of yesterday,
we now believe that we can predict them.
Professor.
Talk to you for a second.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
What is it?
Current pulse rates of
the monitoring stations.
All along the San Andreas Fault.
Their averages are spiking from 82 to 85,
but the biggest jump
is coming from San Francisco.
More than 20 points higher
than what we saw in Nevada.
No, no, no, no.
Let's not panic.
We checked.
- We double checked.
- Henry and Sally has them run triple check.
Those are the counts.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Okay.
Uh.
If...
If we draw a line...
from San Andreas up to Hoover Dam.
It almost literally follows
the Colorado River,
which is a natural deformation event.
And geologically...
deformation events, marked boundaries.
They marked boundaries.
So what if...
What if this...
whole chunk of land is
connected to our tectonic plate.
That would tell us that,
what happened yesterday
in Nevada was not an anomaly.
No. What if it was a precursor movement
along the leading edge of the
plate boundary fault from Los Angeles
all the way up to San Francisco.
Are you saying, you think the whole
San Andreas Fault, might go off?
Yes, that is exactly what I am saying.
Who should we call?
Everybody.
Oh, bloody hell.
I have something.
Here.
Completely idiot.
Thank you, very much.
That's very kind of you.
Yeah, no problem.
Uh, I'm Blake by the way.
Oh yeah, I'm...
I'm Blake.
Hello Blake.
I'm Ben.
Ben Taylor is my name.
- Please to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.
So, is that your father you came in with?
Daniel Riddick?
Uh, he's my mom's boyfriend.
Ah.
Are you meeting with him?
Oh no, I'm...
I'm... not even close.
I wish.
I'm interviewing for a job here.
Mr. Riddick is the...
boss of the boss, of the boss
that I'll be working for.
So uh... What kind of job
are you interviewing for?
Anything in engineering or design.
I'm not picky or proud.
I just...
I just want to work here.
If you are an architect,
this is the... place to be.
Hi, I'm Ollie.
He's my brother.
Hi, it's nice to meet you Ollie.
I'm Blake.
You know, you're quite beautiful.
Why, thank you.
Ollie, did you, did you...
Sorry.
You remember what we discussed.
Sit still and no talking.
It is not normal to bring
little brothers to job interviews.
So let's stop.
It's embarrassing, okay.
Do you mind if I get
your phone number for him?
Ollie!
That's exactly...
What?
You'll never ask for it.
And then I'll have to listen how much
you regretted not getting it.
- I...
- Mr Taylor.
Ms. Carter will see you now.
Thank you.
I, uh...
- I...
- Good luck.
Thank you.
You...
sit here and don't say another word.
- Hi. I'm Ben.
- Hello.
- We're going head straight over to security.
- Excellent.
What do you want to talk about?
- Where're you from?
- England.
Ben thought that while our parents
were going together on a cruise.
He and I should take a holiday in the city,
after his interview.
- Awesome.
- Oh.
Would you like to hear our itinerary?
Los Angeles
Susan.
It's nice to finally to meet you.
You, as well.
If Daniel asked you to move in with him.
Things must be pretty serious.
Yes
Hi, I'm Larissa.
I'll be taking care of you today.
Can I tell you about our specials?
Please, I love to hear it.
Actually, could you come back
in a few minutes, Larissa.
Yeah.
Sure.
So...
I understand you've been married before.
Uh, yes.
And you have just the 1 daughter, right?
Right.
Your other one drowned in an accident?
Yes, to put it bluntly.
- Oh, I didn't mean it like that...
- Uh.
Could you just give me a moment.
Hi.
Everything okay?
Oh, I'm on my way to maintenance
before we head out and...
Am I interrupting anything?
Nothing important.
What's going on?
Look, I just... I wanted to tell you
I was sorry for how I acted yesterday.
- No Ray, really.
I just wasn't ready to hear about you
and Blake moving in with someone else.
I should have told you before.
And how's Blake feel about it?
.
I think it's going to be hard for her.
Get back.
Emma.
- Emma?
- Oh god. We have an earthquake.
Oh Jesus, Ray.
I got to get out of here.
Where are you?
Shit, at the top floor.
Emma, listen. Get as many people
as you can, and get to the roof.
I'm in the helo and
I'll get you from there, okay.
- Okay, okay...
- Okay. Get to the roof, honey.
Oh, no, no...
Under the table.
Drop, cover and hold on.
Lawrence, the rate just jumped
from 6.5 to a 8.5
- What does that mean?
- Powers of 10th.
So it's a hundred times stronger now.
Don't worry. Caltech is probably
the safest place to be right now.
Professor, looks like the whole
San Andreas Fault line is being activated.
And it's heading towards San Francisco.
Alright, we're all done.
Okay.
Well, it's really nice to meet you, Ollie.
I hope you have fun while you're here.
Bye Blake.
It's nice meeting you as well.
Goodbye.
Oh, and uh...
I almost forgot.
Do you mind if I borrow
your book for a second?
Tell Ben that I'll help anybody
who work for him.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I can't wait to be 20.
Thank you.
It's an earthquake.
Well, go, go, go.
Get us out of here.
Oh god.
Look out!
Aw!
That's it.
Go, go, go!
Jesus Christ!
Aww...!
Oh shit!
My LEG!
Are you okay?
Oh my god.
He's... He's dead!
Blake.
Blake, Blake.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Yeah.
No.
No. I don't think.
I don't think so.
But my legs are stuck.
My leg.
- Push.
- Come on.
Okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
Oh god.
Okay.
Think.
Think.
Daniel?
Blake, I'm gonna go for help.
- No, Daniel. No.
- I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
Daniel, don't.
Please don't leave me alone.
Daniel.
Don't take too...
Come on, help me.
- Help!
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
Help! There is a girl, trapped in a car.
- Where?
- In the parking garage.
Oh God.
Out of the building.
Get out from the front!
Mr. Riddick.
Mr. Riddick.
I don't know.
Mr. Riddick!
Help me!
Come on.
Come on.
Blake.
Oh my god.
- Susan! Susan.
- Emma!
- We got to get to the roof.
- Oh god!
Let's get out of here!
This way!
Get out of my way!
Susan.
Susan.
Aww!
Oh my god.
This way!
Get over here!
- Come here. You got to go.
- Okay.
Larissa. Larissa.
You have to come with me.
We got to get to the roof.
Everybody.
Get to the roof.
There's a helicopter coming.
- No! Wait.
- Wait. We got to go up!
Aww!
Ray.
You better be waiting.
Ray.
Oh, my god.
Oh my god.
Up there.
Oh.
Come on. Come on.
We got to go.
Emma, RUN!
Ray.
Emma.
Ray.
Ray.
Emma.
I got you.
Emma, are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?
- Uh, no. I don't think so.
Okay. It's going to be okay but listen
we got to get out of here.
I need you to get to the front left seat.
I'll be right there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Shit!
- Ray!
- Hold on!
Help!
Somebody help me.
Help!
Somebody help!
- This is Ray.
- Dad, please help.
- Blake, what's wrong?
- Dad, Dad.
I don't know where Daniel is.
I'm trapped in the limo,
in garage of his building.
Baby, are you hurt?
Blake.
God damn it.
What?
What is it?
Shit.
Her cell service just went out.
There is no way a rescue personnel are going
to be digging in the garage anytime soon.
Too many populated place ground.
But... uh.
What are we going to do?
We're going to get our daughter.
Blake!
- Blake!
- Help me!
Help, I'm here!
Blake. Blake,
It's Ben, are you okay?
I can't get out.
The roof collapsed.
My legs are trapped.
Okay.
Okay.
Ollie. We need to lift this beam
to get the pressure off her legs.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Let's try this.
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.
Ready, 1.
Come on.
Give it everything you got.
Do it!
It's... working...!
Ollie.
Ben.
- Ollie.
- Let's do it.
Let's do it.
No.
No.
You guys have to get out of here.
This building is going to collapse.
Not a chance in hell
we're leaving you in there.
Okay.
Okay.
Alright.
Here we go.
Brilliant.
It's working.
I'm still stuck.
- Ollie.
- She's moving.
Hurry, hurry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Pleasure.
Let's go.
Come on, it's another aftershock.
We got to get out of here.
Hurry!
Come on, come on.
We have to get away from these buildings.
- Blake! Blake!
- Oh my god.
This way.
- Oh my god!
- Over here.
Blake!
Jump.
Go, go, go.
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.
What an asshole.
I got to get a hold on my parents.
I got to let them know I'm okay.
Cell phones aren't working.
I've tried.
I need to find an electronic store.
Does that book of yours list businesses.
My book has everything.
The good news is most of our
emergency systems are still working.
We got signals coming in from 17 monitors.
We just experienced a 9.1
Lawrence You need to see this.
What've you got?
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.
- Yeah, okay.
- And here are the pulse rates now.
The same, or higher.
The earthquake didn't diminish them.
Oh man.
Oh, this is not good.
Alexi.
I want all the data from every monitoring
stations still up along the fault line.
- And get them to me now.
- Right.
- What's going on?
- It's not over.
Oh man.
Come on.
- I need everybody.
- What are we doing?
Get me on the air.
We need to warn people.
How. There's no way to upload a signal.
Ha-ha-ha.
You're at Caltech.
Okay, who wants an "A" in independent study?
I'm starting a new class.
"How to save lives by
hacking media outlets."
Hell yeah, man.
I'm in.
Sweet bro.
Get your laptop, let's go.
Move.
Move.
Here we go.
Up.
It should be just up ahead.
There it is.
Anything running on electricity
isn't going to work.
So, we have to find
a rotary or push button phone.
How do you know all these?
My dad.
He works for LA Fire and Rescues.
Over here.
Great.
I'll look for a landline.
Got one.
Blake?
Dad, I got out.
I'm okay.
She's okay.
Let me talk to her.
Blake?
Mom?
Oh.
Thank god, honey.
Is Daniel okay?
He what?
these 2 brothers that I met,
overheard him and they came to help me.
I'm with them right now.
He left her?
We're coming to get you, honey.
Where are you?
I'm in an electronic store in Chinatown.
Honey, it's going to be okay
but I need you to listen to me.
Get out of there is going to be
a couple of bleak reluct nightmares.
So get to higher ground.
It's safer and that's where
I gonna be able to see you.
- Okay.
- Do you remember where we
spent Mallory's birthday weekend?
- At Coit Tower.
- Yeah.
Yeah. That... That tall
cement nozzle thing on the hill.
Exactly.
Don't stop anywhere.
Go there.
That's where we'll meet.
Stay strong, honey.
We're coming to get you.
Wait, Mom, Mom.
How...
How are you and dad together?
We'll explain later, okay.
Honey, I love you.
I love you guys.
Bye.
Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you
You left my daughter?
If you are not already dead,
I'm going to fucking kill you.
Attagirl.
Alright, we need to get going.
So, how's your dad going to pick us up?
He's on his way in a helicopter.
That's so cool.
I need you to look up
Coit Tower on your map.
It's your turn.
Your parents will be worried sick.
Thank you.
Run! Run!
All of you! Get out of my way!
You know,
when you were talking to Blake,
that was the first time I heard you said
Mallory's name, since we lost her.
Hey, did you know that Blake keeps
pictures from our San Francisco trip?
Yeah.
In her memory box.
So ironic,
us heading back up there.
It was a fun trip.
Where are we?
Bakersfield.
Or what's left of it.
Puts us about 90 minutes from San Francisco.
Ray?
Did you just turn off the engine?
Yeah, we've got a gearbox failure.
Must be that hit it took in LA.
- I'll have to autorot take down.
- Auto... Auto what?
We're going to crash.
- Uh. Okay.
- Hold on.
Here we go.
Aww!
Oh my god.
Almost there.
Almost there.
We're just going to settle down right there.
JESUS!
We've got fuel all over us.
We need to get out of here.
Come on, we got to go.
Stay down and stay low.
Okay.
Okay, just got to keep moving.
Look for the key.
Come on, come on, come on...
Get in, get in, get in...
I think this truck is stolen.
Alright. Well.
Let's steal it again.
Ray.
Easy.
I'll be needing that truck.
Not today.
The quake centered about 20 miles
East of downtown Los Angeles
Cell towers are down.
Most of the city's electricity... down.
The devastation in Southern California
is expected to be massive.
- We're in.
- Yes.
Okay.
Here we go.
- from Los Angeles.
- 5.

Hello, Criss.
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes.
Executive Director for
Earthquake studies at Caltech.
He and his research partner Dr. Kim Park
had come up with a model
that predicts earthquakes.
They knew LA was going to get hit.
But nobody listen to them.
It's time now to listen.
- Go ahead, Doctor.
- Okay.
In seismology terms.
What we experiencing is
what we called a swarm event.
Basically, California's entire
tectonic plate has shifted.
Yes, it seems the quake we
experienced here in Los Angeles
did major damage all the
way up in San Francisco.
Yeah, but the earthquake that
they felt was from movement
along the fault line in the Central Valley.
The end of the fault line has not moved yet.
More importantly people need to know
that the shaking... is not over.
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about.
San Francisco will get hit again.
And it's going to be a
bigger monster this time.
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.
It will be so big,
that even though it's
happening here in California,
You will feel it on the East Coast.
I cannot emphasize this enough.
To the people of San Francisco.
You need to get out.
And I mean now.
And if you can't, you need to
find any means possible.
To drop, cover and hold on.
Because your life is going to depend on it.
God be with you.
San Francisco 184 miles
Aftershocks continue
to rock the Los Angeles...
You ever think about what
our life would be like
if we hadn't lost Mallory.
- No, I don't
- I Do.
- All the time.
- We moved on.
We didn't move on.
- We stop moving.
- We didn't lose her on your watch.
- No, but I lost her.
- Can we not talk about this?
You owe it to me.
This... This is the most I've
gotten out of you since she died.
I need to know, Ray.
Was... Was it me?
What did I do?
Because I never blamed you.
I don't want to talk about it,
it doesn't matter.
She's gone and now you're gone.
What's the point.
I guess the point is.
This... is why I stick around.
Wait!
Look out!
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Hey! Turn the wheels, turn!
Ray!
What is this?
San Andreas Fault.
I told you, we should have
gone the other way.
Because you knew this was going to happen?
We owe you guys a huge thanks.
- Really.
- No need.
We already made the same
mistake ourselves, but...
busted an axle when we went off the road.
Thank goodness my eyes are better than his.
Do you know if there's any way around this?
The 198 might not be out, through the pass.
How far is that?
Oh, got to backtrack maybe 70 miles or so.
BURDGE AVIATION
Sir, if you don't mind me asking.
Where did you get your hat?
BURDGE AVIATION
You guys really bail us out.
- Sure we can't fly you anywhere?
- Yeah.
Our son lives in the mountains,
so there's no place to land.
- Thanks for the wheels.
- You bet.
Be safe.
Bye.
JUMP SCHOOL
We should be fueled up
in a couple of minutes.
Okay, great.
Everything okay?
You asked me before if it was you?
It wasn't.
I knew you didn't blame me, Emm.
I just don't know how to
deal with... Mallory's death.
It was my idea to take
Mallory rafting that day.
Ray.
You can't blame yourself for what happened.
It's just different when it's your own kid.
I know.
Sometimes I can't get that
look she had out of my head.
The moment she realized that...
I wasn't be able to save her.
And then coming home every day...
to you and Blake calling, hit it harder.
Because nothing was the way it used to be
like the way it used to be it was.
It's perfect.
I should have let you in.
I just didn't know how.
I'm so sorry for all the things
I did go unsaved.
I really am.
If you couldn't save our daughter,
then nobody could have.
I missed her so much.
Me too.
Let's go get our daughter.
Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Let's go.
Go.
Follow the evacuation line.
Just a few more blocks to Columbus Avenue,
which leads to Coit Tower.
Do you mind if I ask.
Why you wear 2 of the same necklaces?
One of them used to be my sister's.
I...
I started wearing it after she died.
We had given them to each other
- I... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean.
- No, it's okay.
I'm... not ready, you know.
Hey, check it out.
What are you doing?
The self-supply box.
It'll have something we can use.
Is this it?
Yes!
Oh, okay.
Here we go.
Every city has a tactical channel that
First Response use to communicate on.
We can listen in and
we can see what's going on.
Okay.
Here, take these.
Blake!
I think we're going to have a problem with
that big nozzle thing
you were talking about.
What?
What do you mean?
We have to go to Plan B.
I didn't think we had one?
I do now.
We need to get to the next highest ground
so that we can signal
my dad in the helicopter.
That would be Nob Hill.
It's the highest point in the city.
It's the other way.
Okay, come on.
Wait, no. Blake, wait!
Wait, just.
Just.
Wait.
What?
Blake, we'll be the only ones
going that way.
My dad said to get to higher grounds,
and that's what we're going to do.
But... what if he doesn't make it?
Listen.
I know that this sounds crazy.
But you have to trust me that he will.
I...
I can't.
Ben.
Did you know about the push button phone
working with the landline?
The supply box?
Tactical radio channels?
I really think we should stick with her.
Okay.
Looks like I'm going to Nob Hill.
Okay.
Let's go.
Residence are encourage
to evacuate immediately
So.
The whole city is evacuating.
Then we got a problem at the airport.
- Where're you going to land?
- You can't.
At least not in the city.
Come with me.
Uh.
Okay.
You got to be kidding me?
Emma, we have no place
to set this plane down.
And we have to get as close to
Coit Tower as we possibly can.
In 3 minutes we're going
to be over Embarcadero.
And?
And.
We're going to drop at AT&T Park.
But I don't know how to parachute.
It's okay, we're going to tag and jump.
I... I think we should stay with the plane.
The plane is going to nose dive
into the Pacific
as soon as it runs out of gas.
Okay.
Trust me.
Oh my god!
- Ready?
- Do I sound ready?
Yup.
Woo!
It's been a while since
I got you to second base.
San Francisco has began
evacuation procedures.
The coast guard is asking anyone
with access to a boat to please...
The end of the fault line has not moved yet.
San Francisco is going to get hit again.
This will be a much
bigger monster this time.
I hope we have given
everyone enough warning.
This is it, isn't it?
Right now, I wanted to be so wrong.
Everyone take cover!
This will be over soon here.
But I pray for the people of San Francisco.
Did you know Nob is a slang term
which means rich or wealthy?
It's a shortened version
of the word "Nobility".
Because of the families that lived there.
It's also derisively known as Snob Hill.
What is it?
Daniel built that building.
Oh shit.
Move! Move!
Come on, Ollie!
Aww!
Aww-ha!
Ollie!
I want to go home.
Hold on. It's going to be okay. I promise.
They're going to get killed out there.
Emm, get to the side of the stadium.
I'll be right back.
Be right back.
It's not safe here.
Get to the side of the stadium.
Get to the side of the stadium.
Right Now!
The building is going to collapse.
You need to move.
Hurry!
You got to get out of the street.
Get to the side of the stadium.
Right Now! Side of the stadium.
Get to the side of the stadium.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Get off the street.
Get to the stadium!
Get to the side of the stadium.
Come on!
Get out of the street!
Alright. Alright.
I got you. I got you.
Stand up.
Over here, Ray.
- I got her, I got her.
- Here. Take her, Emm.
You're going to be okay.
Everybody, down!
Everybody, okay?
Anybody hurt?
No.
Emma, are you okay?
Yeah.
How'd you know we'll be safe?
Just get up against something sturdy.
Protect yourself.
Triangle of life.
Let's go.
She's going to be okay.
But how do we get through that?
We don't.
We go around it.
You need to take that out of there.
If you try walking with it,
It will cause more damage.
This is gonna hurt.
You ready?
Okay.
God.
Ben.
I'm alright.
I'm alright.
Do you think you can get some weight on it?
We have to keep moving.
We got to get up that hill.
Okay.
Here.
How bad did they get hit?
Largest quake.
A new record in history.
No.
Coit's been burning a while back.
She's gone some place else.
Now. Where are you, baby?
Where are you?
What's your plan B?
Shit.
- What's happening?
- We got to go.
Water being pulled out like that,
it's a tsunami.
We got to get out of the bay, now!
Wait, wait, wait.
Give...
Give me 1 second.
to coastal areas of
northern and central California.
We got to...
We got to go.
We got to go.
We got to move now.
We got to get to Daniel's building.
Ray.
I see it!
Alright, hold on.
We got to get over it before it crest.
Come on!
Come on...!
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.
OH SHIT!
Ray.
Hold on.
What's that noise?
We're not high enough.
Get down!
Get down!
Take cover!
Hold on tight, Ollie.
Ben.
Ollie.
The water is still rising.
We have to get higher.
This way.
- Ben.
- Ollie, come.
Grab on.
Oh my god.
Where is she, Ray?
She's a smart girl.
She probably head for
one of these highrises.
We just got to find her.
Are you alright?
I need to take a look at that leg.
Ollie.
See if there is something that
we can use as a bandage.
- And see if you can find clean water.
- Okay.
I got it.
Okay.
Let's see what we're dealing with here.
What?
You are absolutely.
Unbelievable.
Mom's going to love her.
- There are a few towels in here.
- Great.
I'll look for some water.
Hey!
I can see some people in a boat.
No way.
No way.
Those are my parents.
Mom! Dad!
Mom!
Hey!
We're up here.
Dad.
Mom.
Mom.
They can't hear us.
What?
And if we don't get to her soon,
we're gonna need some gas.
We got maybe an hour,
an hour and a half tops.
- Before we...
- Ray.
- Yeah.
- Hold... Hold on.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
It's Blake!
- Oh my god!
- Emma.
Emma!
Blake!
Ollie.
Ollie.
Ollie!
Ollie!
Ollie.
Ollie...!
Ollie!
I got you.
I got you.
Where is Blake?
She's over there.
Stay here, Ollie.
Blake!
Blake!
Blake!
The building is sinking.
We have to move.
We have to move up.
Come on, Ollie.
Hurry.
No, no, no, no.
Oh my god.
Blake.
Emm, take the wheel.
I see a way in.
I'm going after her.
Ray.
I'm bringing her back.
I promise.
Daddy.
The door is locked.
Blake, don't worry.
I'm going to get you out of here, okay.
I'll get you out.
Dad, please.
I'm scared.
I'm running out of air.
Daddy, I don't think if I can do this.
Blake, you hold on!
Hold on!
There.
Ben.
I don't want Blake to die.
She's not going to die.
I'm going back for her.
Okay?
But I need you... to stay here.
Okay?
Good boy.
Ben.
On my back.
On may back, Ollie.
Blake is going to die.
Isn't she?
Alright.
Alright.
I love.
I love you dad.
And please...
Please tell...
Please tell Mom that I love her too.
Blake, don't you quit on me.
Blake!
Blake.
Blake.
Blake!
Come on.
Breathe, Blake.
Breathe, honey.
We got to get out of here.
Break a window.
Oh my god.
Move!
Get out of the way!
WATCH OUT!
Get on.
Let's go, let's go!
Move, move, Ollie.
- Come on, Ray.
- Take her, Emma.
I got her.
It's okay.
Wake up, honey.
Come on.
We got to...
- Get us out of here, Emm.
- Okay.
The building's coming down.
Oh... my... god...
Come back to me.
Your dad and I are right here now.
Blake.
Breathe.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Baby, breathe.
No... my... baby...
I'm not gonna lose you too.
Come on.
Come on.
Baby, come on.
...a picture of the
scale of the devastation.
And this was the sight
in many neighborhoods.
Families and friends huddle together.
Shaken but grateful to still be alive.
Seismologists will be keeping a close watch
on all of the world's tectonic plates.
As the San Andreas quake could have
rippling effects throughout the globe.
You did good.
Thank you.
We all did.
attributing a tremendous
amount of lives saved
thanks to local experts who were
able to give ample warning
of the massive earthquake
Mean while recovery efforts
had begun in the bay area.
Where TEMA, National Guard and
UN relief teams have all been mobilized
Aided by the thousands of
volunteers pouring into the state.
SAN FRANCISCO. WE WILL GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.
Ollie.
Ben.
I...
I found this on the boat.
Thank you.
We want to thank you guys for,
being there for Blake.
Yeah, thank you.
You're welcome.
But it was more like, she was there for us.
I think.
This is incredible.
So.
What now?
Now, we rebuild.
