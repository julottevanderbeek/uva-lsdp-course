And I will see my dream
come alive at last
And they're not gonna
hold me down no more
No, they're not
gonna change my mind
'Cause I've got faith

I'm going where my heart

I've got strength

No one's gonna bend

Captain's Starlog, November 27, 2154.
We've returned home for the official launch
of our sister ship Columbia.
On a personal note, I'll also be saying good-bye
to one-hell-of-a chief engineer.
Yeah?
She's a thing of beauty.
Columbia's virtually identical to Enterprise.
A good engineer can see the differences.
You coming to the mess hall later?
My "going away" party?
I don't understand the logic behind this transfer.
You're not being promoted...
You think I'm doing this to advance my career?
You wouldn't leave Captain Archer
without sufficient reason.
Well, for one thing,
this is a new challenge.
It took me a year to fine-tune Enterprise.
I figure I can do the same
for Captain Hernandez in half the time.
She needs a Chief Engineer
who's been out there... has the experience.
Are you leaving because of me?
Starfleet's approved the transfer.
You didn't answer my question.
This may come as a shock,
but not everything in my life
revolves around you.
I'm glad we got here early.
There never used to be a wait to get in.
You didn't think Madame Chang was going
to be your little secret forever, did you?
There are a lot of Starfleet people here.
That's probably my fault.
I told a few friends about the place.
A few?
I'm a COM officer. If there's one thing
that I know how to do, it's disseminate information.
You didn't tell me how your meeting
went today at the IME.
They asked if I was interested
in becoming Director of Xenobiology.
That's great!
Are you going to accept?
I'm considering it.
The truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates.
I'm not certain I'm ready to leave them just yet.
What would you suggest?
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I've got a vested interest in keeping you around.
You, Denobulan, come with us.
What do you want?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
Hoshi...
I'm all right, sir.
Who did this? That's what I'm trying to determine.
Commander Collins, Starfleet Security.
Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed.
There were three men. They were...
They were in the shadows.
I didn't get a good look at them.
You told me before that one of them
said something to the others.
Right before I passed out.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't English.
Do you remember what he said?
I'm sorry, sir. The only DNA we've recovered
belongs to Ensign Sato and to your Doctor.
We did find some residual
ionization traces here.
A transporter signature?
Very few people have access to that kind of technology.
Still, it's a likely explanation.
Dr. Phlox was involved in an altercation
the last time he was in San Francisco.
You think this is related?
Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare.
If the man who attacked him was holding a grudge...
He was a loudmouth in a bar.
I doubt he could find his head with both hands,
never mind organize a kidnapping.
We're pursuing all avenues.
Excuse me, Captain.
Lieutenant.
Check with Starfleet Operations.
See if their satellites picked up
any transporter activity this evening.
The dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within .3 microns.
The specs say .5.
Who do you think wrote those specs?
A warp field specialist?
Exactly.
Some guy who's probably never
been outside the solar system.
I've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside
one of these engines. I know what I'm talking about.
Aye, sir.
Biggs, Pierce.
I want you to recalibrate the field stabilizers.
Rivers and Strong, you'll start
with the injector assembly.
This bucket of bolts was supposed
to leave dry dock six months ago.
I guarantee you Columbia's gonna warp out of orbit
before the end of the week.
Let's get to work.
It's customary to report to the captain after a transfer.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I wanted to see what the situation was like
before we spoke.
Commander Charles Tucker,
reporting for duty.
Welcome aboard.
Trip is it?
That's right.
So what do you think...
can she be salvaged?
I think there's a good chance.
Any news on Dr. Phlox?
Not so far. If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.
You certainly know how to motivate the troops.
We'll be pulling triple shifts
if we want to meet this new launch date.
You still need to eat.
Captain's mess, tomorrow,
We can trade stories about your former CO.
I'll be there.
And Commander...
drop by the quartermaster's
at the end of your shift.
Ma'am?
You might want to...
update your uniform.
Aye, Captain.
Come in.
We've heard nothing from the kidnappers...
not even a ransom demand.
I've spoken
with the Denobulan ambassador.
He's notified the doctor's wives.
Hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers
say something in another language...
but she was semiconscious at the time.
Maybe you could help her remember.
A mind-meld?
I've never initiated a meld before.
I don't have the proper training.
I know it's dangerous...
but I can walk you through it.
You?
I had Surak's katra in my head
for four days.
I picked up a few tricks.
Computer, access satellite logs 1-3-7.
Time parameters 1900 and 1945 today.
What?
Starfleet Operations,
this is Lieutenant Malcolm Reed aboard Enterprise.
Please acknowledge.
Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant?
Sir...
I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops.
Let me guess.
You want to know why the grid covering San Francisco
was down for maintenance tonight.
Something like that.
Meet me at this address...
in one hour.
My mind to your mind.
Our minds are merging.
Our minds are one.
Nothing's happening.
T'Pol, try to relax your emotional suppression
just a little.
I feel what you feel.
I know what you know.
Can you hear me?
Yes... perfectly.
You and the doctor have
just left the restaurant.
I'm glad we got here early.
There never used to be a wait to get in.
Good.
They asked if I was interested
in becoming Director of Xenobiology.
Where were you attacked?
There.
Truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates...
Do you see them?
...not certain I'm ready to leave them just yet.
What would you suggest?
Yes.
You, Denobulan, come with us.
What do you want?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Focus on the moment.
Put aside any pain.
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
"Bring him with us."
It's Rigelian.
A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hours
after Phlox's abduction.
According to their flight plan,
they were headed for Proxima Colony.
This trajectory won't take them
anywhere near Proxima Colony.
Ensign...
Sir.
Put Admiral Gardner through to my ready room.
Shore leaves are canceled.
Get everyone back aboard.
Am I to understand you are responsible for taking that
satellite grid off-line?
Not me personally.
But you're involved.
Phlox is my friend.
Do you know where he is?
We have an assignment for you.
I wasn't aware that
I was still a part of your section.
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant,
and it may be the only way
to save your friend's life.
Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor.
You will work with Dr. Antaak.
I will do nothing of the kind.
Then you will die.
I'm certain there are easier ways
for you to recruit a new lab assistant.
You misunderstand me, Doctor.
Antaak will be assisting you.
It's good to see you again, Doctor.
I beg your pardon?
I wouldn't expect you to remember
but we met briefly five years ago,
at the IME conference on Tiburon.
I don't recall meeting a Klingon
at that conference.
I was disguised as a member
of the Mazarite delegation.
My people weren't invited.
I will let you two get "reacquainted."
I suggest you work quickly, Doctor.
I expect a progress report
by sunrise.
You must forgive the general's conduct.
The warrior caste has little use
for social protocols.
What do you want with me?
The Empire is facing its gravest threat
since the Hur'q invasion.
A virus is spreading from planet to planet.
Millions are already infected.
If this continues, the Klingon
species will cease to exist.
Why didn't you simply ask for our help?
Starfleet and Denobula would've provided you
with all of the specialists you'd need.
You don't understand the Klingon way, Doctor.
To ask for assistance would make us look weak
in the eyes of our enemies.
It could even incite rebellion.
But why me?
I was impressed by your lecture
at the conference.
Your paper on viral propagation
was very insightful.
What field of study are you in precisely?
Metagenic research.
I've already isolated the virus.
I assume you'll want to start
by mapping the nucleotides?
It wasn't my idea to abduct you.
Nevertheless, you are here.
Millions of lives are at risk.
The freighter's warp trail has terminated.
They may have dropped to impulse.
How long to intercept?
At our current speed...
Archer to Engineering.
Commander Kelby...
respond.
Kelby here, sir.
We could use a little more speed.
The injectors are running at 105%.
Commander Tucker's pushed them higher than that before.
I'll see what I can do, Captain.
I don't know who's in charge of your mess hall,
but he could give the chef on Enterprise a run for his money.
I stole him from the Republic.
Captain Jennings said I could have anything
I wanted when I left... so I took his cook.
I've gotten two transfer requests
from crewmen in your department.
Who?
It's probably better
if I didn't mention names.
I denied them.
You're already short-handed.
Quite an impression you've made, Commander.
You've been aboard less than two days
and already some of your team want to jump ship.
I've knocked a few heads together...
but we're getting the job done.
We'll be ready for warp trials by Thursday.
I was surprised you accepted this transfer.
I saw an interview with you
after the Xindi mission.
You said you couldn't see yourself serving on any other starship.
Well, you've got a good memory, Captain.
It comes in handy.
I was getting a little too comfortable on Enterprise.
Got a lot of friends over there but...
sometimes it's easier to work with people
who are just colleagues.
Why are you here?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
Is this a daydream?
I'm meditating.
This is where I go in my mind.
Wow.
I would've thought
you'd pick a more interesting place.
Like the beach or...
one of those fire plains
you showed me.
Please leave.
Exactly where am I supposed to go?
Away.
This is my daydream. You go away.
Excuse me, Commander?
Is everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
The diagnostic you asked for. Thanks.
Bridge to T'Pol.
We're approaching the coordinates.
On my way.
No bio-signs.
I'm reading several bodies aboard.
Is one of them Denobulan?
They're all Rigelian.
Can you tell who did this?
No, sir.
I'll have to bring aboard
some of the debris and analyze it.
Scan for their data recorder.
It might tell us something.
Unless I'm mistaken,
this virus is a mutated form of the Levodian flu.
It's immune to whatever
antiviral we've tried.
We should contact the IME.
They may have seen this mutation before and I'm certain
they'll be willing to share their database with us.
I know of a few indirect channels.
No one would have to know.
There's no reason to contact them.
We've acquired their entire database.
You stole it.
Medical research isn't a priority
for the High Council.
I'm forced to obtain information
however I can.
That doesn't sound very honorable.
Given the choice between honor and saving lives,
I choose the latter.
Perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal
a genome sequencer, hmm?
We're not going to be able to map the virus
without the proper technology.
This man's been infected.
Very observant. We are being exposed!
This patient is at stage one.
The virus doesn't become contagious until stage three.
When I asked you to bring me a subject
for dissection, I assumed he'd already be dead.
He won't be alive much longer.
What do you think you're doing?
Euthanizing him. Out of the question.
I thought you were committed to saving lives.
It is more honorable to give one's life
to medical research than to die for no purpose!
That choice is not ours to make.
Proceed.
Computer, establish an encrypted com-link.
Starfleet frequency seven-nine-baker.
Lieutenant.
You told me the Klingons were going to rendezvous
with that freighter -- not destroy it.
I regret what happened,
but they had to cover their tracks.
How many were on board that ship?
That's not your concern.
Have you analyzed
the weapon signatures yet?
Yes.
You haven't told Archer?
But I'm not certain how much
longer I can keep this from him.
Orion raiders have been known
to operate in this area.
You want me to lie again?
I could explain
the situation to the Captain.
You have a peculiar sense of humor, Lieutenant.
I've worked closely with the man.
You can trust him.
Archer is a Starfleet captain.
His duty would be to report everything
you tell him to Admiral Gardner.
They would launch an investigation.
I'm being compromised, sir...
and I don't like it.
Then I suggest you adjust
your comfort level, Lieutenant.
You made a commitment to us
long before you joined the Enterprise.
Tactical alert. All hands to battle stations.
What was that? I believe we're under attack.
Hull plating's holding.
Still no response.
Target their weapons.
We've been boarded.
D-deck, starboard side.
Access tube Seven.
Seal it off.
Get the MACOs down there.
Dah petagh.
ay'vamDaq nuHmey tIOeg!
Disable that ship.
I don't want them getting away.
jol Quv yIchegh!
They've activated their transporter.
They're going to warp.
Pursuit course.
The helm's not responding.
Wake him up.
Why did you attack us?
SoHvaD pagh vIjatlh, human.
"I have nothing to say to you, human."
That sounds like... Klingon.
There must be some kind of mistake.
What is it?
According to his bio-signature,
he is Klingon.
He must have been surgically
altered to look human.
Any theories?
I need to run further tests. Their boarding party
disabled our antimatter flow regulators.
Warp drive should be repaired
in six hours.
Give our new chief engineer a hand.
Tell him to dig a little deeper.
See if these "Klingons" damaged any other systems.
The Rigelian freighter--
did you get anything out of the black box?
It's been erased.
It might've been a safeguard,
in case it fell into the wrong hands.
Work with Hoshi.
See if you can reconstruct any data.
There is something familiar about these base-pair sequences.
Familiar?
Mm.
Boshar!
Feeding time is over.
Go back!
Do you think it's wise
to keep wild animals in here?
There are dozens of creatures in your Sick Bay.
I don't let them roam free.
I could never keep Boshar locked up.
He was my first patient.
He tore his side open when I was a child.
I stitched the wound myself.
I have seen these sequences before.
Six months ago, to be precise.
This is Augment DNA.
How did modified human genes find their way into this virus?
Is it really such a surprise, Doctor?
It took only two human Augments to commandeer
a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew.
The Empire could not allow an inferior species
to gain an advantage on us.
Imagine every Starfleet vessel manned
with genetically engineered humans.
Earth banned genetic engineering
decades ago!
The Augments who attacked you
were relics of another era!
The Vulcans told that
to the High Council.
They weren't very persuasive.
We were simply responding to a threat.
You were trying to create Klingon Augments.
But Soong's experiments were all killed.
Where did you get the genetic material?
Several embryos were found
in the wreckage of the Bird of Prey.
We used them to resequence
a number of test subjects.
There were some
unanticipated side effects.
Their cranial ridges started to dissolve.
Augment DNA was more aggressive
than you realized, hmm?
For a time, it appeared we were quite successful.
Our Augments might have looked human,
but they were Klingon--
stronger, more intelligent.
Then...
their neural pathways started to degrade.
They died in agony.
One of the test subjects was
suffering from the Levodian flu.
The Augment genes modified the virus.
It became airborne.
You should have told me this earlier!
If you hope to ever leave this place,
I suggest you stop asking questions and resume work.
What do you think?
We may be able to reconstruct the directory
with a recursive algorithm.
Is it unusual to have weird
dreams after a mind meld?
Subconscious thoughts
are often exchanged.
They sometimes surface during sleep.
I had a bizarre dream last night.
Commander Tucker was in it.
We were in a strange place.
It was all white.
There was almost a, uh...
romantic quality to it.
I don't ever remember dreaming about
Commander Tucker before.
Most unusual.
The recorder was erased...
deliberately.
Malcolm said there might've been a safeguard.
The memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler.
You're sure?
It left a unique magnetic signature.
We found it in storage locker C-14.
The last person to access that locker
was Lieutenant Reed.
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, sir.
Only someone with security clearance
of alpha-four or higher had access to the black box.
That's just T'Pol, you and me.
I agree.
It is a bit of a mystery.
You're sure that freighter
was destroyed by Orion weapons?
There's no doubt.
I asked T'Pol to double-check
your analysis.
The freighter was fired on
by Klingon disruptors.
With all due respect, sir,
there must have been a mistake.
I've seen the sensor logs.
Someone could have tampered with them.
I want to know
what the hell is going on.
Answer me, Lieutenant.
Respectfully, sir...
I refuse to answer
any more questions.
Malcolm, I never would've believed that you,
of all people...
Corporal.
Lieutenant Reed's been relieved of duty.
Escort him to the brig and confine him.
We've set course for Klingon territory.
We haven't picked up
any warp signatures yet.
I may have to take this ship into their space.
I don't have to tell you how dangerous that is.
If you know where they've taken Phlox...
I have no idea
where the doctor is, Captain.
On that, you have my word.
Your word isn't worth a lot at the moment.
The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life
before committing treason.
I'm not working for the Klingons.
Who, then?
You've betrayed everything
that uniform stands for.
Captain...
There are some...
obligations...
that go beyond my loyalty to you...
and this crew.
What the hell does that mean?
I can't say any more.
You haven't said much of anything.
You've told me a lot about your father...
his years in the Royal Navy,
their tradition of honor and service.
How do you think he'll react
when he learns you're facing court-martial?
I wouldn't know, sir.
We are running out of time.
I can't sequence these nucleotides any faster.
Perhaps you should've abducted Dr. Soong.
He could've mapped this genome
more efficiently than I can.
We tried.
Soong was under heavy guard.
If you don't accelerate your efforts,
there will be no one left to cure.
The High Council has dispatched the fleet.
They have annihilated N'Vak Colony.
N'Vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague.
They're massacring the victims?
The Council will do whatever's required
to contain this outbreak.
General, we're making progress,
but I'll need a few weeks to develop an antiviral agent.
It will have to be tested...
Millions will be infected by then.
The Council will not wait!
How long until the fleet reaches us?
Five days.
I can't cure this in five days!
They wouldn't destroy us if they knew
we had created Klingon Augments.
The experiment failed!
It succeeded for a brief period.
If Phlox and I can find a way to stabilize
the human DNA prior to the onset of stage three,
our Augments would survive.
If we're successful,
you could use them as leverage,
force the High Council
to give us more time to find a cure.
You don't seriously expect me
to help you create Klingon Augments?!
You could save the inhabitants
of this planet.
I won't assist you.
Kill me if you must.
I refuse to cooperate.
Take him.
Hail the dock master.
This is Captain Hernandez.
Request permission to depart.
You're cleared for departure.
Smooth sailing, Columbia.
Thank you.
Bridge to Engineering.
Are we ready, Mr. Tucker?
Just a few more seconds.
I hope.
Ensign?
Dilithium matrix is stable.
Driver coils are configured
for warp speed.
Nice work.
Engineering to bridge!
We're ready whenever you are, Captain.
Time to weigh anchor.
Lieutenant, aft thrusters
at one-half until we clear spacedock...
then take us to warp.
So, what are you in for?
Is your captain hoping you'll obtain information from me?
I shouldn't think so.
Then why are you here?
That's a long story.
Entertain me.
I lied to him.
You're fortunate to be alive.
A Klingon who betrays his captain
would be immediately executed.
Why did you and your men board Enterprise?
You know, you may find this hard to believe, but...
you and I actually want the same thing.
And what is that?
A cure.
There's no reason for you
or any more of your people to die.
There's a malfunction in the intermix chamber.
Plasma pressure's rising.
The antimatter flow regulators
are locked open.
Did the Klingons damage them?
Uncertain.
Pressure's approaching critical.
Can we drop to impulse?
The reactor would breach.
But we can reduce pressure by increasing speed.
Go to maximum warp.
Get down to Engineering.
See what you can do.
You sabotaged us.
How do we repair the damage?
If our reactor breaches, you're going to die with us.
I'm a soldier of the Empire--
I'm prepared to die.
Captain!
You need your tactical officer!
Please, sir!
I can be useful!
Commander, did you see that?
Please be more specific.
On the monitor.
T'Pol to Captain Archer.
Go ahead.
The warp matrix has been compromised...
by a Klingon subroutine.
Can you remove it? I'm not certain.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.
Do what you can.
Bridge to Captain Archer.
Pressure's increasing again.
Take us to warp 5.2.
Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
We're out of options, Travis.
Acknowledged.
