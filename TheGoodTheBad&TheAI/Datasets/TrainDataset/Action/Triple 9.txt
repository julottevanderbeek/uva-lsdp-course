The more jobs we do with these guys...
The more they squeeze us.
Fucking Russians.
MIKE: Well, Vassili kept things tight,
at least you knew where you were.
But this bitch...
I don't know.
RUSSELL: Man, no shit.
I can almost feel her
breathing down our necks.
I'll tell you what though, man.
This job, it's keeping her up nights.
Yeah. Well, the less we know, the better.
All right, so what we're talking about,
we're gonna need more bodies.
Franco and Marcus?
That's our move?
Well, we could do it ourselves, but...
Inside three minutes?
No, it's not possible.
Job needs to be done in broad daylight.
That means civilians, that means terrain.
We need them.
GABE: Don't worry.
I trained with Marcus.
Ah, shit. Fuck.
Hey, watch the leather, man.
GABE: Yeah.
So, yeah, these guys,
they can handle themselves. Trust me.
I'm telling you, Mike.
Me and Marcus go way back.
It ain't Marcus I'm worried about.
All right.
We go in two weeks.
MARCUS: What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?
GABE: I just don't get how you can love
a dog more than a chick is all.
MARCUS: Well, you got a girlfriend,
now you can talk about women, huh?
Hey, Russell, where did you say your
brother met that girlfriend he has now,
the one he's in love with?
All right.
I need you all to
tighten it up for me now.
RUSSELL: Hey, you heard him.
- Tighten it up.
- MARCUS: All right.
FRANCO: You better be
right about this, Mike.
IRINA: "One day, the czar's
gardener came to report
"that someone had been stealing
the fruits from the garden.
- "Determined to catch the thief...
-
"...the czar ordered his three sons
"to watch his precious
garden through the night."
-
-
"Elizabeth was loved by everyone in town."
Let's make this one for the books, huh?
Here's some paperwork to get it done.
Check them!
FRANCO: Radio check.
Check, check. One, two.
We're good.
- We good?
- MIKE: Yeah.
- Down! Everybody down!
-
- Everybody down!
-
-
-
RUSSELL: Franco, guy on your left.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
DISPATCHER ON RADIO:
Advise if responding, robbery in progress.
First City National...
Mike, call just went out.
Stand by for responder ETAs.
FRANCO: Hands out where
I can see them, cabr√≥n!
You too!
Come on, put your hands out.
Face on the floor!
Don't move!
Open your mouth.
RUSSELL: All right, 512 and 11 responding.
Three en route.
They're getting close, Mike.
Two and a half minutes.
FRANCO: Open it.
RUSSELL: ETA is one minute, Mike.
Response is coming from the south.
RUSSELL: Working on a game plan. One sec.
-
-
FRANCO: I'm on it!
Don't move!
GUARD: Everybody in the vault!
Gabe, remember, north on Hill
and east on Ninth.
Copy. North on Hill and east on Ninth.
MIKE: Go!
FRANCO: Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah!
RUSSELL:
Okay, you're approaching an intersection.
You've got a window. Take it.
- Here. Right here.
-
GABE: Fuck!
Shit. Shit.
RUSSELL: Gabe, you're gonna take
the highway entrance ahead.
What the fuck?
Do not let him decelerate, Mike.
Do not let him decelerate.
Take this oncoming lane.
GABE: I can't see shit! What fucking lane?
Now!
GABE: What the fuck?
No way, no fucking way. I can't get it.
-
- Whoa!
- Oh, oh, fuck!
-
MIKE: Oh, shit.
RUSSELL:
I'm cut off behind the collision, Mike.
You're on your own.
-
-
RUSSELL: Franco, make some noise.
Keep these people back.
Fuck.
Gabe, let's move. Get the box!
- Come on!
- GABE: Fuck!
RUSSELL: Franco, you've made
your point. Stand down.
GABE: Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
FRANCO: Shit.
MARCUS: Goddamn stupid bullshit!
GABE: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like I was planning that shit!
FRANCO: God damn it, Gabe,
you still a fucking amateur.
What the fuck!
GABE: Shut up!
The fuck you thinking
you greedy piece of shit?
They put the bait in there
for dumb fucks like you!
Marcus! Put your shit in the trunk, man.
Fuck!
- Bitch!
- MIKE: Three days.
Unless you hear from me different.
Yeah, you know what? It was a gamble!
But you'd all be blowing me right now
if that shit hadn't been rigged.
- Fuck you!
- And you know it!
-
- Is this a game?
Yo, put it away, Franco.
Franco, man.
You ever point a gun at me again,
you'd be a fool not to use it.
- You understand me?
-
- Copy that.
- Copy that shit.
GABE: Go catch some bad guys, detectives.
RUSSELL: You pull that shit out there,
what you think's going to happen?
Huh?
What the fuck you think
is going to happen to you?
What?
Can't you see what I'm trying to do here?
- Get off me.
- I ain't gonna get off you, little brother,
because you're going to
end up fucking dead.
You didn't see the same shit
me and Marcus seen.
Fuck, what? Navy SEAL shit again?
Huh?
Mike is pissed.
-
- But Mike's still Mike.
These other two, Marcus and Franco...
Hey.
Do we have to worry about them?
Cops look after cops.
Same as you Special Ops do.
It's fine.
All right.
All right?
RUSSELL: Gabe's been clean for six months.
He's trying.
He was a good cop.
Look, I know you give a fuck.
We're family, man. We're family.
ISUPK PREACHER ON BULLHORN:
God and righteousness will prevail.
Death to the ways of the devil.
All will prevail.
Goodness will prevail.
White devil establishes himself by rape!
MAN 1: That's right.
Murder! Robbing people!
God hates the white devil.
MAN 2: True, brother!
He's the illegal immigrant.
You, sir!
You have the sign of the beast around
your neck like a hangman's noose.
God and righteousness will prevail.
The original man will rise.
He will rise again!
Death to the ways of the devil.
OFFICER: Detective Allen.
Goodness will preval.
JOSHUA: Well, they fired a warning shot.
Uh, 12-gauge tactical round.
Run it.
TRINA: Yeah, we're dealing
with a crash-and-bash, four-man team.
We're pulling surveillance now.
The dye pack destroyed
most of what they took in cash.
But their focus was on
a security deposit box.
TRINA: Yeah.
- Belonging to who?
- TRINA: It belonged to
a wealthy Russian named Dimitrije Petkov.
Family claims they have no idea
why he would keep a box here.
That's Walter Sims,
the bank manager right there.
Get me that report.
Walter.
Detective Allen. First time being robbed?
No fun, right?
They've got pictures of my family.
My daughters. Where we live.
My daughters' school.
Walter, you're a bank manager.
You should be smart enough to know
that the monster has gone digital.
Be careful what you
insta-google-tweet-face.
Fucking sons of bitches.
Hey, hey, Walter.
Give 'em hell, baby.
TREVOR: Bye, Daddy.
SGT. NELSON:
Everybody, listen the fuck up!
I just found out Captain is still waiting
on a current gang initiation
report from some of you.
- Smith.
- Mmm.
Uh, same as always, Sarge. Um...
They get in a circle and they
kick the shit out of each other.
And then they hug it out.
- SGT. NELSON: Just get it done.
- Sorry, Sarge.
Also, First City downtown
got held up this morning.
Apparently, they were heavily
armed and spoke Spanish,
which narrows it down to just
under a quarter of the city.
GOMEZ: Uh, I resent the racial
implications of that remark there, Sarge.
SGT. NELSON:
And they all live in your one-room duplex,
so they shouldn't be too hard to find.
Call Marcus's mom. She's at my place.
- ALL: Ooh!
-
Make calls, check with our people.
Jeffrey Allen from Major Crimes
will be heading up the investigation.
Speaking of, allow me
to introduce his nephew, Chris.
Where'd you come from again?
Zone Two. Uh, FIT Unit.
-
- FEMALE OFFICER: Mongrel territory.
Crossing guard.
Two, huh?
Belmont. Pair up with Allen.
Come on, man.
Maybe he can get you
to come to work on time.
Are you serious?
SGT. NELSON: Now remember, first to
find a gun out there gets the day off.
That's all I've got.
Hey, Sarge, can we talk about this?
Hell no.
-
-
- Get the fuck out of the way, man.
-
CHRIS: We looking
for anything in particular?
Always.
Hey, Shanice, come on down from there now.
Hey, Snap, baby!
OFFICER: You're in trouble now.
Look, I was minding my own
till these motherfuckers showed up.
- MARCUS: Come on down from there.
- SHANICE: I'm just having me a good time.
Come your ass down!
Damn.
How the fuck you got up there?
All right, come on over here, boys.
Come on, man.
Y'all go over there and help.
You better not be watching
my motherfucking ass.
NEWSCASTER:  Sources are
saying the brazen robbery may have ties
to cartels and even the Russian mafia.
With more on this, our crime
correspondent, William Moran.
MORAN: Thought to control 70% of the Russian
economy, the Russian mafia is the...
FRANCO: Huh.
Yeah, listen, uh...
I'm going to call you back.
Yeah, thanks.
MIKE: How's work? Anything from Marcus?
Quiet as a mother's prayer.
Good. I'll see you guys in two days.
MORAN: A senior State Department
official was quoted as saying,
"There is not a major Russian organized
"crime figure that we are tracking
"who does not carry an Israeli passport."
Come.
You know how this works.
MIKE: Take it easy, man. The safety's off.
Oh!
Hello, little man!
Daddy!
How are you doing? All right?
I missed you.
There really is no love quite like
a father's love for his son, no?
Come.
IRINA: So, you know, Michael,
Vassili will be calling.
We are grateful for your work,
but in this case,
we need to withhold payment.
- There is a second job.
- MIKE: No!
We done the job. Pay the fucking money!
Mmm.
My sister...
My sister always went for stupid men.
Why? I do not know.
Perhaps it is that my sister,
too, is stupid.
A terrible thing for
a sibling to say, I know.
But she is a great beauty, yes,
which goes a long way in this world,
but look in the eyes and you will see it.
A great yawning stupidity
and a complete and utter
lack of judgment in men.
- But love...
-
Love makes great demands of us all. Hmm?
What do you want?
He's going to be calling again.
Hello, Michael.
Elena.
What's going on here, Irina?
The fucking feds?
- What the fuck are you in?
-
Thank you, Elena.
Yes, I have just been speaking to Michael.
Mmm-hmm, I was just about
to discuss that with him.
MIKE: This wasn't the fucking deal.
IRINA: Michael is still resistant
about the second job.
IRINA: I know this.
The FBI have traced the files.
They are in the possession
of Homeland Security.
IRINA: Of course not.
MIKE ON PHONE: Yo, man. We got a problem.
What's that? Irina?
Yeah.
Yeah, we need to meet now. All of us.
They're fucking with us, man.
There's another job they want us to do.
Just ain't no dealing with these people.
Man, we should have cut
those ties years ago, after Iraq.
Guess it's not so clean
when you got a kid in the mix.
I'll call your brother. See you in a few.
Yeah, all right.
MARCUS: ...and she's like,
"Give me a kiss, give me a kiss, Daddy."
And I'm like, "Whoa, baby,
look, you're an informant.
"That is against police protocol."
Strictly speaking,
you shouldn't even be sucking my dick.
- Yo.
- FRANCO: What are we doing here, Mike?
- Where's Russell at?
- MARCUS: I don't know, he's your boy.
Put a GPS on his ass.
Yo, Gabe. Where your brother, man?
Don't ask me. He's a no-show.
What are we doing here?
She ain't paying.
Bullshit.
There's another job.
MARCUS: The fuck you talking about?
She says it's worth three mil
on top of what she owes.
Oh. Of course she did.
She didn't pay now, why the fuck pay later?
Bullshit, she's playing you.
- She got what she wanted, right?
- What?
She got what she wanted!
FRANCO: The fuck I got to
deal with this bitch, huh?
You're the one who got us
hooked up with this bullshit.
This come from your end.
- You deal with it.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
MIKE: You two are really
in it now, Franco.
How you figure?
She got the feds in her pocket, baby.
- Yeah.
- Feds?
I've seen them. They're all
up in there, one big happy family.
And I ain't got to
remind either one of you
how much the feds love dirty fucking cops.
Look who decided to show up.
Check the side!
-
- Russell!
- Back up! Back up!
- Get it off! Get it off!
Get him out of here!
Get off me!
Get him out, Michael.
Come on. Get him out.
No, his hands are tied. I can't get him.
FRANCO: Get him out the car, Mike.
MIKE: All right.
Oh, shit!
FRANCO: How's it look?
It ain't good, man.
MIKE: He ain't gonna make it.
Russell.
I'm going to take care of you now.
Go on.
-
- Don't look at it.
Fuck!
Oh.
It's Michael again.
IRINA: I know.
You know?
Here.
He's not calling for me.
I'm going to bed.
TRINA: My, what big teeth you've got.
Some guy used this in a robbery
a couple nights ago.
TRINA: Ingenious.
Hit the lights, panda bear.
So, we agree the whole
Spanish-speaking thing is bullshit.
No way these guys are Cartel.
Tell me if you notice anything.
TRINA: Well, this isn't street.
These guys have had tactical training.
JEFF: Some of these guys
are military for sure.
The czarina, what's she after?
Psst.
MIKE: She ain't said yet.
Whatever it is, it's in an unmarked
Homeland Security building.
DHS uses it as a weigh station
for sensitive materials
coming in and out of the country.
How many guards?
MIKE: Unknown.
Unknown. Probably a lot.
- Definitely some private tactical teams.
-
Some kind of rent-a-SWAT.
So what are we talking?
Four maybe five minutes tops?
No, man. No.
We're looking at 10.
FRANCO: Uh, yeah, that can't be done.
Response would be on us in three minutes.
MIKE: Well, they'll kill every last one
of us, we don't get this thing.
FRANCO: We could pull a 999.
That's not such a bad idea.
FRANCO: That'd buy you 10 minutes.
- Oh, my God.
- Twenty minutes.
You're kidding.
Tell me you're fucking joking!
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Enough of this cop shit.
English.
MARCUS: Jesus Christ.
You gotta fuckin' love this job.
Hey, try not to get
a stain on your shitty suit.
I'm not worried. I've got two.
Looks like the Lae Me
sent us a kite from prison.
-
- FRANCO: Looks that way.
MARCUS: Hey, genius,
can one of y'all turn that off?
Fuck.
Chris, this is Sergeant
Franco Rodriguez. Detective.
Detective, that's Chris.
Homicide.
This is my new partner.
Got called up from "Zone Two."
So what does working in Zone Two
tell you about all this?
Uh, I don't know. Let's see.
Which means loose lips sink ships.
In American.
Right?
Something like that?
Okay, I'm going to go look for a witness.
Nice to meet you, Rodriguez.
Any familiar faces?
Well, not these two losers,
but this right here
is Pedro Marquez.
FRANCO: Affiliated?
Locos o Trece.
Next county over.
But I don't know why the fuck
they'd be over here, man.
FRANCO: Probably looking for their bodies.
- Hey, Ed you talk to these guys yet?
- ED: Not yet.
What's going on, guys?
Y'all been out here a while?
Hey, I'm just going to ask you
some questions, man.
You don't have to square up on me.
You come over here and blame us
for them fools, huh, puto?
I didn't say that.
That's exactly what
you said, motherfucker.
I didn't. I'm just trying to find out
if somebody saw something.
Fuck you, jura.
- All right.
- Tell you what,
I'll get balls deep in your pink,
you fucking feel me?
FRANCO: You, uh, want to take care
of your partner over there?
Motherfucker.
Them cuffs a little too tight.
You fucking punk bitch...
CHRIS: Shut the hell up!
Yo, Snaps. What's up
with your hyna here...
Shut the hell up.
Pinche mayate!
Hey, didn't the cop tell you
to shut the fuck up? Listen!
- Fuck you...
- Get him. Come with me.
Back up. Back the fuck up!
Come with me.
Hey, homeboy. Hey, go get a cigarette.
Come on, man.
You're closed for five minutes.
The fuck are you doing, man?
I could ask you the same thing.
I didn't throw a guy on the ground
and try to incite a fucking riot.
He was running his mouth.
You didn't hear him.
Running his mouth?
What, he hurt your feelings?
It's the fucking streets,
that's what people do.
You even know who that is?
- That was obstruction.
- Oh.
He was getting in the way
of my investigation.
Get out of school, man.
There ain't no obstruction up here.
That's Luis Pinto.
He's a Mara Salvatrucha lieutenant.
You think somebody gonna talk now?
- Oh, he's a lieutenant?
- Yeah.
I didn't realize. Well, I'll just go
and apologize to him, then.
This ain't a fucking game, Chris.
The rules around here are different.
This ain't Buckhead, all right?
So you better learn fast.
Hey, let me tell you something.
You got a problem with me,
put it on the table,
but don't pull me aside and question me
like you know something I don't know.
You let an asshole like that bow up on you
in front of the whole neighborhood,
you're the one who's got
some explaining to do.
Now, get off my back and let me do my job.
Oh, you know the whole game now, huh?
Unlock the door, stupid.
MIKE: So what? We do this Triple 9,
we get 10 clear minutes?
Kill a cop? You get all damn day.
FRANCO: A 999 gets called in,
all units in the area converge
on the downed officer.
It's open-season.
Everybody wants a piece of a cop killer.
MARCUS: It's like pulling the plug
and the whole force going down the drain.
And you're absolutely sure
that you can make this happen?
Oh, yeah.
All right.
You the police.
But you...
You're gonna have to hard check
that fucking liability.
Worry about the 999, Franco.
I'm going to go bury my friend.
His brother.
Unless you want to help us dig a hole.
Yeah, I didn't fucking think so.
Yo.
Yo, my man.
Fucking come on, man.
Let's get out of here.
You good?
All right. Come on.
I should have known better.
There's got to be a different way.
What, are you suddenly getting saintly
because this FNG wears a shield?
There's a difference, Franco,
and you know it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bullshit.
How many cop funerals have you been
to in the last five years, huh?
And you tell yourself the same thing that
every cop sitting there tells himself.
"Better him than me."
If you're having
a problem with this, Marcus,
I'll do it.
I don't have a problem taking out a cop.
I'll do a cop just like...
Oh, ho, ho. A little to the right.
- Let's reload. Don't let 'em know.
- Missed.
MICHELLE: What are you
doing in there, Uncle Jeff?
Nothing's happening over here.
JEFF: How's your job going?
CHRIS: I don't know,
it's going all right, man,
but I would like to make a difference.
I know how that sounds.
What are you laughing at?
You're gonna make a difference.
You ain't going to
make a fucking difference.
Get that notion out of your head.
- You know what you need to do?
-
Your job, keep your head on a swivel,
out-monster the monster,
and get home at the end of the night.
Uncle Jeff.
- Can you do that?
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
- You know what kind of spots I've been in?
A lot hairier than this...
- So don't worry about me.
- No. I am worried about you.
You don't realize...
Any one of these little fucking
snake-eyed motherfuckers,
you know, could be strapped right now.
I owe it to your mother.
I owe it to her.
Look, it... I can't look after you...
Fuck these motherfuckers.
Any one of these cock...
Hey!
Hey!
Are any of you cocksuckers
strapped right now?
- You?
- Jeff...
You got a gun on you, huh?
Jeff, hey. Sit down. Sit down.
Hey, what does little Trevor
want for his birthday?
Uh, he wants a gun.
A gun?
No. He wants a toy gun.
Another toy gun.
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
How you doing, boy?
- You good?
- Yeah.
Okay.
All right. Let's get this off you, man.
Go on, sit down.
There you go. There it is.
Just sit there for a second
while I go speak to your mother.
You fucking late.
You're lucky you get to see him at all.
I need to see your sister.
Why the fuck ain't she answering my calls?
Michael, I had to convince my sister
to spare you, okay?
Have a little gratitude.
You need to do this for me, okay?
Or you need to get the fuck out.
I'll see what I can do.
Now, hurry, okay?
I only have an hour.
Felix, come here. Come here.
No, no. You ain't gonna
do that in front of my son.
Go on. Find your mother.
IRINA: Sit down, Michael.
Have some tea. We have much to discuss.
We do?
What do you want to talk about?
Do you want to talk about Russell?
Hmm.
Yes. That.
You want to get this thing done,
you stay the fuck away from my crew!
There you go, sweetie.
Hmm, so now that all of
that is out of the way,
Vassili would like to know
how things are progressing.
Tell him we've got a way to make it work.
This is fantastic news.
Yes.
You know, I think I'd prefer it
if you just watched porn.
I was about to.
Oh, good.
- Are you sulking, baby?
-
No.
You look like you're sulking.
Listen, you wanted this job, remember?
We... Yea...
That was before I knew that it came
with a fucking asshole of a partner.
Come on, baby.
You need to work with these guys.
Since when does my tough guy
let anyone get to him.
Nobody got to me.
Now, stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
And come to bed.
MARCUS: My partner is not a problem.
MIKE: Are you sure about that, man?
Look, I don't give a fuck
about this guy, all right?
He's perfect. The minute Jeffrey Allen
hears his nephew is down,
he'll send every cop to the call.
Right, Franco?
FRANCO: I've seen him.
He's our guy.
Look, I got a spot in mind.
Those abandoned projects
over on Washington.
All right.
MIKE: Sounds like it's settled.
This guy's done nothing.
Does he have a family? Do you even know?
I don't care.
If it comes down to us or some cop,
I'll be damned if it's not us who walk away
from this thing, you understand?
Say it, man.
Say you understand.
Russell would've found another way.
Look, it's one more fucking job.
Just another fucking job.
If you in, get your shit
together right now.
There must be...
Don't do this, Mike.
You got a better idea?
You?
Fucking look at yourself, man!
Fucking look at... Fucking...
Get the fuck out, man!
Get the fuck out!
MARCUS: Now this is the house, right here.
That's our boy. Fat one on the porch.
I'm going to talk to my source.
You want to come with me, see if that great
police work you did yesterday paid off?
- You're a riot.
- All right.
BOY: Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Don't tell him your name, homie.
You that cop who busted up Luis
the other day?
That was a misunderstanding.
EMILIO: Like, why don't you go bother
some other homies, know what I'm saying?
CHRIS: Why don't y'all go to school,
you know what I'm saying?
Man, this homie's
getting homeschooled, bro.
By who?
By me. Teaching 'em mad skills, yo.
For real? Well, I got a question for you.
The Mara Salvatrucha sign,
where's it come from?
It's from here.
This is from here?
Black Sabbath.
EMILIO: Who the fuck is Black Sabbath?
MARCUS: Hey, y'all rug rats
don't go to school?
Get out of here. Go to school, man.
I will arrest your little ass.
- JEFF: Okay, stay on that.
- TRINA ON PHONE: Okay.
I got two or three more
sources to check in with.
I'll call in later.
Yeah. Oh, uh...
Hey, someone named
Sweet Pea called you back.
Okay.
- SWEET PEA: Come on, girl.
- JEFF: Hey, hey.
Girl, do me a favor. Go and set the bar.
I need five minutes.
- Girl, I got you.
- Thanks.
-
- Come here.
You're looking good, Sweet Pea.
Thank you, Daddy.
-
-
What have you got for me?
Child, I don't want no parts of this.
JEFF: I'm listening.
Baby-doll.
Mama will get killed if the tea gets out.
So this shit here is going to cost you,
and I ain't talking shortbread.
You gonna have to show me
a whole lot of coin.
Five G's if it goes anywhere.
All right, look. I'm going
to tell you, but this is it, Jeffrey.
I mean, I'm working here now, okay?
I'm doing what I do, so no more favors.
Okay.
Anyway.
The other night, I heard some fucked-up
bitch talking to another girl
about some creepy motherfucker,
some fierce, scary shit
like out of a horror movie.
Now, I only heard bits and pieces,
but this bitch kept going on and on
about some dude covered in red dye
looking like the devil's dick.
The bitch that was doing all the talking,
she said that this man of hers
said that he robbed a bank,
and, honey, all hell broke loose.
Oh, now, the girl who told you this,
what was her name?
She go by Leah.
Some old working junkie bitch.
She dance here off and on, and I see
her in the street from time to time.
MARCUS: They don't have a baby.
They just got a stroller full of dope.
He did good with that stroller.
Kicked it, folded it up like a pro.
Oh.
OFFICER: Unit 406 to perimeter.
We're going to let the woman leave.
Pick her up once she's out of the complex.
MARCUS: Fernando Rivera, AKA Termite.
Hitter for the Mexican Mafia,
fresh out the pen.
Just did an eight-year
stretch for trafficking.
His PO issued us a violation warrant
so we can talk to him about
the severed heads last week.
Let's see what he's got to say, boys.
MARCUS: Barry, you're shield.
Smith, you're second. Gomez, breach.
Second team. Jackson, shield.
Buck will be first cover.
Hey, Chris, you up to
take the lead on this?
CHRIS: Window!
MARCUS: Go!
CHRIS: Going up!
WOMAN: What the fuck are y'all doing?
- Get the fuck back in the house.
- WOMAN: Fuck you!
This is my house. Don't be telling me
to get the fuck back inside my house.
SMITH: Breach!
Police!
CHRIS: Check that closet.
OFFICER: Clear!
CHRIS:
Couch on the left, stairs on the right.
- OFFICER: Copy.
- CHRIS: Moving.
Check that couch, check that couch.
Cover. Cover.
Moving up.
Get down! Get down, motherfucker!
CHRIS: Check that bathroom.
Go.
OFFICER: Clear.
CHRIS: There's a baby in the bed
in the bedroom on the right.
I'm going right. Go left.
-
- Go, move.
Clear.
Check the closet behind me.
Get some hands for that baby.
- Contact.
- Clear.
SMITH: Termite, come on out,
you dumb-fuck.
Let's not get your fucking baby killed!
Gomez, go for that door.
Cover me.
CHRIS: Two, go closet on left.
Three, go behind the door.
Closet on left. I got it.
- Door clear.
- Closet clear.
Moving up.
Bathroom on the right.
Bathroom clear.
CHRIS: Three, clear
the closet on the left.
Two, go right.
- Got the closet.
- Check under that bed.
Clear.
CHRIS: Moving up.
Three, go bedroom on the right.
- Two, go bathroom.
- Got it.
- Bathroom's clear!
- Bedroom's clear!
CHRIS: Moving down.
CHRIS: He's out, he's on foot.
He's on the run!
MARCUS: Go, go, go!
Get down, get down!
-
-
Get down! Get on the ground!
Fuck!
- CHRIS: Hey, you good?
- MARCUS: I'm good.
Go!
Chris.
Chris!
Chris, come on, man. Come on.
Are you okay?
- You all right?
- Go, go, go.
South side, heading east.
Marcus, give me your 20, man.
Hands! Show me your hands!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Hey, did you see somebody?
Where'd they go?
MARCUS: Fuck.
Get back, motherfucker, or he die!
What was his name?
Tank.
- That's a good name.
- It's a great name.
- That's a good name.
- Yeah.
Sorry, man.
I can't remember one shot from yesterday.
Is that weird?
No, man, it's called survival
stress reaction, you know?
Mmm-hmm.
Chemicals flood your brain.
Forebrain stops working,
your amygdala fires up
- and you're just...
- Mmm.
I didn't see him coming.
Right? I mean,
he just came out of nowhere.
It could happen to anybody, man.
Well, it didn't happen to you.
I'm a badass motherfucker, dude.
I'm going to take a piss.
Have fun.
Do you know what
this song is about, Michael?
No?
Then I will tell you.
It is about two lovers betrayed
by the secrets they keep for others.
And they must choose.
Exile or death.
Like me and my dear Vassili.
Vassili is finally coming home to me.
Once you have completed this job,
they will release him into Israeli custody.
We are going to be a family again.
Where's Felix?
We own the secrets of kings, me and him.
This is why we have survived so long.
Where's Felix?
Felix and Elena won't
be joining us tonight.
Here. Hear it for yourself.
-
-
- MIKE: Elena?
- Michael.
Where are you?
Irina didn't tell you?
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Elena.
Fuck are you?
Felix, baby. It's your dad.
Daddy wants to speak with you.
I swam with the dolphins,
Daddy, me and Mommy.
Where you at?
We're staying at the beach
and Auntie Irina said we're going
to come here to take me to the zoo...
- What do you mean?
- ...for my birthday.
Okay, love you. Bye.
No, no... Wait a second.
Felix. No, Felix...
Elat. Our family home.
Three hours south of Tel Aviv.
Felix seems to love it.
He loves the sea.
Me, I do not like it much myself.
There is something idiotic about it.
Take a look. He is so cute.
Yeah, see, there is Elena.
No, no, no, Irina.
We're doing the job.
We're doing the job.
She has a very nice ass, my sister.
So, this is the objective.
The security key
and gate codes you will need.
The case arrives tomorrow night,
is there for 24 hours, then it ships.
We meet one more time after this.
How that goes is up to you,
and then we decide when Felix
comes home from vacation.
It would seem the house is burning
and the clock is ticking, Michael.
MARCUS: The room goes quiet.
All right, everybody, listen up.
This is a cop's brain. All right?
This is a cop's brain on some shit.
This is a cop asshole.
- This is a cop's asshole in supermax.
-
Any questions?
That's a big asshole.
Hey, I've got to talk to you.
- OFFICER: Who the fuck is this?
- Don't worry, boys. Wait.
Hey, Jack, get them some drinks.
Man, come on, get them some drinks.
All right, you got it.
All right, you heard the man.
Drinks on Marcus.
You fucking nuts coming here!
You don't think somebody
from the precinct might recognize you?
Get up, you stupid fuck!
Don't fucking do this, Marcus.
You come near me again,
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!
You ever actually used your gun, huh?
Put one in someone
that doesn't have it coming to them?
- Shut up.
- I know you, man!
- You might not think I do, but I know you!
- Shut the fuck up!
- You ain't gonna do this!
- Shut up!
Look, I can see it in your eyes.
You are a fucking coward, all right?
What, you think this
is gonna make you a man?
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
GABE: Is that him?
It's all right, guys. He was just leaving.
GOMEZ: Didn't you hear the officer?
What was that all about, man?
Some piece-of-shit source I used to use.
All right, let's go get a drink.
Forget about it.
GABE: Get the fuck inside.
Just get the fuck inside!
LEAH: Like you know
who you trying to tell?
Get your ass inside!
No, you're not doing this tonight.
Get your hands off me!
You're not pulling
any more tricks tonight.
- JEFF: That's the boyfriend?
- JOSHUA: Yep.
JEFF: Hmm.
JOSHUA: Piece of work.
We'll put a tail on both of them.
JOSHUA:
All right. I've got four in tail, so...
Not a very healthy diet.
Sweet.
That's disgusting.
Waste not, want not.
JEFF: Speak.
TRINA: Uh, hey, I got you that info.
Gabriel Charles Welch, 35.
He, uh, served three years on the force.
Oh, you sure?
Yeah, racked up a slew of reprimands
before getting dismissed
for a questionable shooting.
Questionable how?
Suicide by cop.
Associates?
Yeah. None on file.
Oh, if there's one, there's another.
Ling, you always come through for me.
I have no doubt you will again.
Fucking cop.
Come on.
- That's it.
-
JEFF: Hmm.
Kicking dope, huh?
No fun, right?
Oh...
Oh, it kicks in nice.
Oh, whoa.
This can go down one of two ways for you.
JEFF: The girlfriend says Gabe
and his brother run with a Michael Atwood.
Get eyes on him.
Uh, she also claims
that Gabe's brother, Russell,
wound up dead the other day.
Let's see if we can't turn up a body.
JOSHUA: Got you. Uh, hold on a sec. Look.
Ling's been trying to get a hold of you.
She said that, um, Gabe Welch
finally stopped in Highland Park.
And he's been on his bike
in front of some house.
Highland Park. What's the address?
Um... 806 Willow Drive.
Apprehend him right away.
Get every available unit to that address!
-
- Copy that, boss.
JEFF: Are you guys okay?
CHRIS: Yeah, we're fine.
Hey, boss. We lost him.
- Oh, God damn it.
- Sorry.
Lost who?
Why weren't you answering your phone?
I'm sorry. Look, Jeff, we're fine, man.
Everything's all right.
Who is this guy?
Gabe Welch.
Ring any bells?
No.
I never heard that name in my life.
Well, he was a cop...
Hey, there, little buddy.
- How are you doing? You okay?
- All right, baby. Come on.
I'll get him back.
JEFF: Go ahead.
He was a cop. And now, he's part
of the crew we're investigating.
Why would he come here?
I don't know. You're investigating him,
maybe he came looking for you?
I mean, that's just too coincidental.
Speak.
JOSHUA: Michael Atwood.
Ex-private security contractor.
He worked for Blackwater.
He and Russell Welch were set
to be indicted for arms smuggling
in a federal investigation
with Vassili Vlaslov in '08.
The case was dropped after
four witnesses went missing.
What's a Vassili Vlaslov?
A Russian Jew.
Russian mob boss to be exact.
Get this. Putin's so scared of this guy,
he put him in the Gulag
four years ago without charges.
Vlaslov's wife, Irina, has been running
the organization from here.
Totally visible.
It's the big, bad wolf, baby.
The fucking La Kosher Nostra.
Exactly. Uh, the captain
wants us to put eyes on her.
He's already detailed us bodies.
What?
FRANCO: You're doing something about Gabe.
I told you, I'm handling it.
Oh, really?
Gabe now is under
fucking surveillance, Mike.
They got people all
over him right now, as we speak.
How?
Oh, that whore girlfriend of his talked.
They on me?
Not yet.
But soon.
And he knows it all.
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.
Do something about Gabe.
Mike...
MIKE: You see what you made me do, man?
You see what you've made me do?
-
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, Mike, Mike. Please, don't.
- You're out, Gabe!
I'm through with you!
I'm through with you, do you understand?
- Mike, Mike, Mike.
-
If it weren't for your brother, I'd bury you
and your fucking whore right now!
It's going down and you need
to stay the fuck away!
Fine, fine, fine. Please.
What happens to Leah?
Just disappear, man!
I'm gone, I'm gone.
I promise, I promise. Mike, Mike...
-
- Mike. Mike. Hey, I promise!
Mike!
Fuck!
JEFF: Have we found Gabe Welch?
TRINA: Uh, no, we're still looking.
JEFF: What about Michael Atwood?
JOSHUA: Uh, I got units placed
outside his place, but it's empty.
JEFF: Mmm-hmm.
Irina Vlaslov?
JOSHUA: Uh, judge denied
our request for a surveillance warrant.
JEFF: Hmm.
Well, have you followed up
on ex-military with records?
TRINA:  Yeah, I mean,
there's hundreds.
We're still going through 'em.
So that's it?
- JOSHUA: So far, but we...
- TRINA: Yeah.
JOSHUA: I got Patterson
working on something.
Does anyone believe in Jesus Christ,
our Lord and fucking savior
and all his miserable, dog-faced saints?
I was raised Jehovah, so...
Can't say I do, boss.
Mmm-hmm. So does anyone believe
that cops have a sixth sense,
can intuit things?
- JOSHUA: Hmm...
- TRINA: Yeah, I mean, you do, yes.
You...
So does anyone believe
maybe something very big
is about to go down?
Sure, boss.
Yeah, of course.
So, does anyone believe
that maybe it's better
to do something more than sitting around
giving me a bunch of
"I don't fucking knows"?
Huh?
FRANCO: Yeah?
Right.
Give a holla if anything changes.
Surveillance lost Gabe last night.
And Major Crimes is looking for you.
Well, they'll be looking
a long time after today.
You all right with this, man?
Everything cool with you?
Yeah, homeboy.
We've got him right where we want him.
Detective Belmont,
you ready to do some dirt?
-
- Huh?
- I'm dirty.
- Yeah, you are.
FRANCO: I know you are.
We got here.
You all right?
Yeah, man, I'm good. You?
- Yep.
- Good.
So where are we going?
Going to see an informant of mine.
A dough boy named Cory Dubose.
So every time he hears
the Rollin 40s moving something
he, uh, gives me a call,
lets me know what's up.
Let's see what he's got. Let's go.
DISPATCHER ON RADIO:
CHRIS: Now, where's this guy at?
Marcus?
- Hey, man, where you at?
-
- Marcus, where'd you go?
-
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Police! Atlanta Police Department.
Put your gun down! Put it down!
Put it on the ground, man.
- Wait, wait.
- Put it down on the ground.
- You're a mark.
- I'm going to shoot you.
Drop the fucking weapon. I will shoot you.
Will you please shut up?
- You're a mark...
- Drop it on the ground.
Behind you!
Shit!
Uh, Eighth and Washington.
Perp running is ID'd Luis Pinto.
Hey, man, talk to me.
How are you doing, man?
Huh?
Marcus!
Marcus!
Hey, Marcus!
Hey, man, look at me.
What's your name, man, huh?
What's your name? You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
You're all right.
I'll just put my hand here,
it'll help you a little bit.
- It'll help with the blood.
-
Hey.
Listen to me.
It's all right.
- Hey.
-
What's your name?
Shh. Slow down.
Call it in, man. He's bleeding out.
Call it in.
Pinto came through.
He came out of nowhere, man.
He just shot him. Call it in, man.
-
- Hey, what the...
Marcus.
Oh, shit...
Hey. Marcus...
You hear me, man?
This is Unit 342,
I have an officer down. 999!
Unit 342. Officer down. Triple 9!
DISPATCHER: Advise if responding.
Shots fired on scene.
All units copy. Triple 9.
Eighth and Washington.
FRANCO: There it is!
GUARD: No, no, no. Wrong entrance.
Back it up.
Back it up.
You guys have been here before.
You know what?
I don't even...
Let's go. Triple 9. Let's go!
Jeff, did you hear the dispatch?
- Yeah. Triple 9.
- It's Chris.
- Fuck!
- Let's go!
Lock down the scene.
Ling, get Colby!
Heads up.
You know who made the call?
I don't know. Jeff!
I see him.
So we don't know if Chris is down?
We're not sure. Jeff!
- Jesus fucking... Get a grip!
- I got it!
Move!
Talk to her. Talk to her!
Just do what the fuck they want!
Just do what the fuck they want!
Just do it!
All right, up!
On your feet. Hands up.
Come here. Against the wall!
Come on. Move!
- Come on. Down. Down!
- FRANCO: All right.
DISPATCHER: I need a unit for
a 211-Adam in progress at DHS Holding.
Repeat. 211-Adam.
Should we respond to that?
TRINA: Are you guys hearing this 211?
Yeah, I fucking hear it!
JOSHUA: Jeff!
CHRIS: Northwest corner
of Eighth and Washington. He's lucid.
Officer is down.
What the fuck is going on?
All right.
That's good enough, right there.
You're going to do
exactly what we ask of you.
-
-
-
-
You got 10 times that amount
strapped to your head.
We can't open the vault.
It's on a rotating time lock.
There's no override.
DISPATCHER: Received. Any units in vicinity?
Fuck me! Send the other car!
Ling, you guys are on the 211.
No, no. Jeff!
Watch it! No!
TRINA: Dispatch, this is Charlie 463
responding to the 211.
JOSHUA: Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ.
I'm seven out. Send more units.
-
-
Fire in the hole.
Two, one.
FRANCO ON RADIO: Response is in.
One car so far. ETA is seven minutes.
JOSHUA: Whoa, whoa... Jeff, watch it.
- OFFICER 1: Back it up. Back it up.
- OFFICER 2: Let's back it up.
- Chris Allen. Where's Chris Allen?
- This way.
No. Don't shoot!
SNIPER ON RADIO: Be advised,
Atlanta PD en route. ETA currently unknown.
FRANCO: Tac team, Mike.
Eleven o'clock high. Four guns.
SNIPER: Tac team, hold until
transmitter is out of range.
SNIPER: Okay, that's it.
Green, green, green. Weapons free.
MAN: Get an updated ETA on this.
So this guy's a Latino,
about 30 years old.
Very slight build. Local tattoos, yeah...
- Jeff.
- Are you doing all right?
-
-
Captain, it's Franco.
- I'm on the 999.
-
En route now.
Damn it.
Are you sure you haven't
seen this Gabe Welch before?
I saw him about a week ago.
He came to a bar Marcus and I were at.
They got into an argument.
I don't know... I didn't hear much of it.
But Marcus said that he was just
some CI he was working with.
Man, so you saw him at the bar,
at your house, here.
Now, that is a cosmic
series of coincidences.
- Remind me to get a lottery ticket.
-
Now, what about Luis Pinto?
Luis Pinto's surrounded by SWAT
a couple of blocks from here.
Detective Rodriguez. Homicide.
Detective Allen. Major Crimes.
All right, well maybe
we'll get some answers out of him.
What, you think
they're just going to arrest him...
Put him in a comfy cell?
They're not.
He's right.
You know this guy?
No, I didn't know him.
But Marcus sure did.
Oh, if you gentlemen will excuse me.
JOSHUA: Rest of you get
the hell out of here.
We need to get to that 211, boss.
It's a clusterfuck.
Let me guess. Our crew.
That's what it sounds like.
Well, not all of them.
What the fuck is this?
Did you wrap it for us?
No, man, it's for Felix.
I was not sure you could pull it off.
I wasn't left much choice.
What about the rest of your crew, huh?
I should like to meet them finally.
They're gone.
Are they?
So you don't think I could shake
some trees around the department
and watch a few dirty cops
fall from the limbs?
Don't give me that look.
You and I, we pray at the same altar!
Irina, I've been listening to you talk
just about as long as I'm gonna.
Where's my son?
Where's my son, you wretched fucking cunt?
Felix!
We train dogs to fuck our prisoners.
Can you imagine?
That's what they say.
That we degrade them with trained dogs.
I can only guess this is how Elena felt
every time she was fucked by a monkey.
I should kill you,
I really should.
But my fucking sister
would never forgive me.
And more importantly,
how would Felix go on loving me so?
Take your money and go, Michael.
Do not look for Felix.
Because I will hear it.
I would be happy to tell him that this
is a good-bye gift from his father.
Anything for that boy.
MICHELLE: Hey.
DOCTOR: The bullet fragment is
embedded in the medial...
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You're bleeding.
- It's not mine.
- How's he doing?
- He's out of surgery.
He's got a bullet lodged in his skull,
and they can't get it out because
of the swelling in the brain
which may or may not go down.
- SMITH: Hey, Chris.
-  Go on.
What's up, man?
Sergeant Nelson just phoned. Pinto's dead.
SWAT put a dozen holes
in the motherfucker.
He went out blazing.
PATHOLOGIST:
They brought him in about an hour ago.
I haven't had a chance to clean him up.
- Are those his things there?
- Yeah. Those are them.
CHRIS: Is this everything?
Yeah, that's it.
Hey, Mike, it's me. Franco.
Take it easy, man.
Just fucking with you.
You're a fucking funny guy, Franco.
You got our money?
We're all good.
How's Marcus?
That dumb fuck's still breathing.
I'll take care of that.
Just like I took care of Gabe's whore.
Left her body in the shopping cart.
Are you all right?
I'm a little sore.
- Yeah.
-
So that's it, huh?
Until the next one.
- Yeah, Franco. Yeah.
-
CHRIS: Come here, dude.
So my boss, he's got a rule, right?
First one of us who takes a gun
off the street gets the day off.
Get to go home.
Sit around, put my feet up.
See that, dude?
You just told me something.
I bet if I lifted up your shirt,
you'd have a gun.
You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?
Now, tell me something
and I'll forget about that gun.
What do you want to know?
You know my partner Marcus?
Yeah.
Was he here the morning that he got shot?
Was he at the park without me?
That morning, pulled up,
talked to my boy, Luis.
Marcus came here
and he talked to your boy, Luis,
on the morning that he got shot?
Yeah.
- Don't mess with me, man.
- No, man, I'm serious.
All right, dude. Hey, give me the gun.
- Who is it?
- Jeff, it's Chris.
Jesus, man.
If your mother could see me now.
There's people you can
talk to about that, man.
There's no shame in it.
What's IA saying?
IA is saying nobody's above
suspicion, including me.
And Rodriguez from homicide is dismissing
the thing as pure coincidence.
What?
You know, I think it might
be worse than that.
I think that Marcus was in on it.
I think he had Luis Pinto try to kill me.
Can you prove that?
Maybe I can.
Marcus and Gabe had history.
They were both stationed
at the same precinct together.
Oh.
So, four-man crew...
Michael Atwood
and one-and-a-half dead cops.
You've got to ask yourself,
who's that fourth guy?
JEFF: Hey.
Gabe Welch's girlfriend, my CI.
Took two in the chest
and one in the back of the head.
I should have seen that coming.
Somebody's cleaning up after himself
and my bet is he wears a badge.
- Boss?
- I need a favor.
Anything.
I need a hard copy on Leah Green's murder.
I need the name of the lead cop
on the scene when they found the body.
Sure, it has to be
our little secret though.
Look at you.
Look at you, you little
worthless motherfucker.
Figured I'd find you here. How's he doing?
What's up?
I was just wondering if you wouldn't
mind coming back to the station with me.
I still need to get
a full statement from you.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
All right.
Hey, Jeff, I'm in an elevator.
I might lose you.
JEFF: Chris? Chris?
Yeah, yeah. I can hear you. Go.
Don't do anything.
It's Rodriguez.
Hey, say that again?
It's Detective Franco Rodriguez.
All right. Yeah, I'll come by in a bit.
Bye-bye.
You all right, man?
My car is over there.
I'll see you over at the station.
Unit 342, shots fired.
