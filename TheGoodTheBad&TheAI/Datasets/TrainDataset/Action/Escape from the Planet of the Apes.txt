We've spotted what
appears to be a spacecraft

just outside the surfline.
7
Alert Rescue and advise
to remain on station for 45 minutes.
8
And we'll squat 7700
for a radar fix.

Radio:
Roger.
10
Rescue,
I have Red Baron 5.

Immediately launch chopper.
Effect pickup and recovery .
14
Base radar will vector.
15
Man:
Every body out! Come on!
16
Let's go!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
17
Sergeant, get that
half-track down here
18
and get a cable out
to those frogmen.
19
Yes, sir!
20
The general, sir.
21
Anybody in that thing?
22
I don't know, sir.
We just beached it.
23
All right,
open her up.
24
Open it up!
25
Welcome, gentlemen,
to the United Sta--
26
- Did you call the zoo?
- Yes, sir, we're in luck.
27
Sick bay's almost empty,
except for a mauled fox cub
28
and a deer with pneumonia
and a depressed gorilla.
29
The apes will be hidden from the public.
They'll be quarantined.
30
They need medical attention,
it's available right on the spot.
31
And the experts can start giving them
the once-over first thing tomorrow.
32
- General Brody's very pleased.
- Oh, me too, me too.
33
We can't allow monkeys to leave
their messes on the floor, huh?
34
Have they been fed?
Raw steak or something?
35
The zoo tells me that chimpanzees,
like all apes,
36
are vegetarians, sir.
37
They suggested oranges.
38
Good God!
39
What's the matter, Corporal?
40
Excuse me. I didn't mean to
disturb you while you're dressing.
41
What the hell am I saying?
42
They're pretending to dress, sir.
43
What do you mean pretending?
They are dressing up!
44
- Where did they get clothes?
- They brought them with them, sir.
45
- What?
- In that suitcase.
46
Suitcase?
47
Uh...
48
Greg, maybe you should
give them their oranges.
49
Uh, well, they're--
50
They're going
to the zoo infirmary .
51
Arrange for a police escort
at 1 630 hours.
52
They'll have company there.
53
There's a gorilla
in the next cage.
54
Why did he do that?
55
56
Here you are, old fella.
57
Boy, you really are sick.
58
Hello, missy.
Have a banana.
59
Have it your own way, mate.
60
- Zira!
- I'm not his mate. I'm yours.
61
Control yourself.
I think they're trying to be kind.
62
This cage stinks of gorilla.
63
Cornelius, where are we?
What's happened?
64
I know where we are.
I know what has happened.
65
In some fashion--
66
and I lack the intellect
to know precisely how--
67
we have traveled from Earth's future
to Earth's past.
68
But we saw
the Earth destroyed.
69
And Earth will be destroyed
just as we saw it.
70
Only since seeing it,
we have passed through
71
a backward disturbance in time.
72
Did you notice the date meter clicking
down after the shock wave hit our ship?
73
Yes.
74
We have returned to Earth nearly
75
That is another reason
for us to keep silent.
76
Our human captors will not
be edified to learn
77
that one day their world
will crack like an egg
78
and burn to a cinder because
ofan ape war ofaggression.
79
80
Apes, at this instant in time,
81
cannot yet talk.
82
For the moment,
we should follow their example.
83
84
85
86
Oh, the driver gave me
this report from the air base.
87
Better read it
before we start the test.
88
Yeah, it's the usual
imitative behavior.
89
"Mimicking salutes,
handshaking, sitting on chairs,
90
eating offplates with knives."
91
- Well, what is it, Lewis?
- There was sort of
a carpetbag on the ship.
92
- Full offood?
- No, clothes and it seems
they changed into them.
93
I don't believe it.
94
95
Hi, Dr. Dixon.
Dr. Branton.
96
- Good morning, Arthur.
- Morning.
97
- The female's a bit uppity, sir.
- Oh? Okay, I'll be careful.
98
I see you've prepared
the Wisconsin multiphasic.
99
We'll begin with that.
100
Um, go easy now, Stevie.
101
Oh, they look
pretty docile to me.
102
Yes, but don't
take any chances.
103
Unless the spacecraft
was remotely controlled,
104
they must have been conditioned to push
at least some of the right buttons.
105
I mean, they can't be morons.
106
All right,
we'll take the female first.
107
Arthur, would you set up a cha--
108
Well, she seems
to be pretty smart.
109
All right,
let's make it more diffcult.
110
They, uh, haven't had
their breakfast yet?
111
Not a bite.
Just as you ordered.
112
Good. We'll offer the banana.
113
114
- Well, why doesn't she take it?
- Because I loathe bananas!
115
- Zira!
- I don't believe it.
116
Yes. Arthur, I think
Dr. Branton needs some air.
117
Zira, are you mad?
118
Dr. Milo, please,
do not call my wife mad!
119
I did not call her mad.
I merely asked her ifshe was!
120
And I repeat the question.
Are you mad?
121
- I hate deceit!
- Well, there is a time for truth
122
and a time not for lies,
but for silence.
123
And until we know who our friends are
and who our enemies--
124
And how in the name ofGod are we
to know that unless we communicate?
125
- We can speak, so I spoke.
- And we can listen!
126
Yes, to a lot of
psychiatric small talk!
127
- And we can watch.
- A display ofprimitive apparatus!
128
Primitive?
It's prehistoric!
129
- Couldn't test
the intelligence of a newt!
- Calm yourself, Zira!
130
- I am calm!
- Zira! Zira!
131
- Stop arguing!
-
132
It's too late for that.
133
Use your heads
and start thinking.
134
Now that they know we can speak,
how much will we tell them?
135
- Milo!
-
136
137
138
139
We'll need a full autopsy.
140
With special emphasis
on the cranial and oral areas.
141
Let us know when the report comes in.
Will you, please?
142
I'd better do this alone.
143
144
Um, we mean you no harm.
145
Do you understand?
We will not hurt you.
146
- Poor Dr. Milo.
- Doctor?
147
Yes. Doctor.
You killed him!
148
No, I didn't. He did.
149
- One of your own kind.
- Zira: He's a gorilla!
150
Well, look, there's
nothing to be afraid of.
151
You see, he's in chains.
He's under sedation.
152
Do you understand that?
153
I should. I've been doing it
halfmy life to humans.
154
Humans?
155
I'm a psychiatrist.
156
Oh, well, I'm--I'm
a psychiatrist too.
157
Do you have a name?
158
My name is Cornelius.
159
This is my wife Zira.
160
And I'm Lewis.
Lewis Dixon.
161
Nobody's going to believe this.
162
Believe what?
163
- That primitive apes can talk.
- Primitive?
164
Uh...well, I mean
that in our, um...
165
primitive, um, civilization,
apes just don't talk.
166
I mean, I think
it's important that when
167
our primitive security
precautions are lifted,
168
that the first time
you say anything in public,
169
you should talk
to what we primitively call
170
the right people.
171
May I say something...
172
personal?
173
Please.
174
I like you.
175
I have from the beginning.
176
177
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- All: Mr. President.
178
I'm aware that what I have to
tell you may conceivably create
a credibility gap
179
- somewhat wider than the Grand Canyon.
-
180
Nonetheless, it is true.
Yesterday, a U.S. spacecraft
181
splashed down off
the Southern California coast.
182
It was one of two that
have been missing in space
183
for over 2 years now.
184
To be exact, the one commanded
by Colonel Taylor.
185
186
Have they identified the bodies,
Mr. President?
187
They have identified
188
189
At the time of their rescue,
through an unfortunate accident
190
one of them was killed early
this morning in the Los Angeles Zoo.
191
- Zoo?
- What would astronauts
192
be doing in a zoo,
Mr. President?
193
They are not astronauts,
General Faulkner.
194
- They are apes.
-
195
Chimpanzees,
to be more precise.
196
They're harmless, friendly,
and by all reports
197
extremely intelligent
and sophisticated creatures.
198
But naturally, being animals,
199
they cannot tell us
where the ship came from
200
or how they
came to be in it.
201
I have, therefore,
decided to convene
202
a Presidential Commission of lnquiry
in Los Angeles tomorrow.
203
The 2 surviving apes
204
will be presented to the commission
for their inspection.
205
The press will be invited to attend,
not to participate.
206
I don't believe
that we can withhold
207
this extraordinary discovery
from the world any longer.
208
209
210
211
One of the 2
American spaceships
212
believed until now to have
disintegrated in orbit,
213
splashed down unexpectedly yesterday
in the Pacific Ocean
214
off the coast
ofSouthern California.
215
And is stated
to have been manned--
216
if you can call it manned--
by monkeys.
217
Reporters:
General!
218
No comment.
I have nothing to say, gentlemen.
219
- Reporters: Senator!
- I'm sorry , boys, not now.
220
I haven't the time now.
A little later, please.
221
Reporter:
Here comes the chairman.
222
Later. Later.
223
As the president's
senior science advisor,
224
what do you expect to experience
from this historic meeting?
225
- Fear.
-
226
All right now,
after I break the news,
227
I want you to start slowly
with simple answers to what will
228
certainly be
simple questions.
229
And if the questions
become less simple?
230
- Be yourself.
- Your better self, Zira.
231
- Please.
-
Man: They're ready, sir.
232
All right, it's time.
233
What do they think
we are, gorillas?
234
I'm sorry .
235
That's it.
Just be seated.
236
Uh, Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,
237
Iadies and gentlemen,
my name is Lewis Dixon.
238
And I am
the animal psychiatrist
239
who has been in charge
of these 2 apes
240
since they came to
the Los Angeles Zoo.
241
My associate,
Dr. Stephanie Branton
242
and I are ready
to answer your questions.
243
What may astonish you
is that, um,
244
our chimpanzee friends
245
are ready to answer
your questions too.
246
Not by signs, not by looks,
or movements,
247
but by words.
248
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
249
250
Dr. Dixon, as a zoologist,
I know and respect your work,
251
but if you think you're going to turn
a presidential inquiry
252
into a ventriloquist's act,
I have to inform you--
253
And I have to inform you, sir,
that these two apes
254
have acquired
the power ofspeech.
255
Come now, Doctor,
you know as well as I do
256
their brain system
is not developed
257
in either the vocal or
abstract thinking area.
258
Yes, sir, but I repeat
that they have the power ofspeech.
259
And it is for you gentlemen
to assess how far that power
260
can be exercised intelligently.
261
Well, may we be told which
is the female of the species?
262
Did she rise as a reflex
to you having indicated her,
263
or in answer to my question?
264
That's for you to decide.
265
- Have you a name?
- Zira.
266
267
Certainly she can articulate,
268
which, in itself,
is extraordinary !
269
Uh, but, Dr. Dixon, are we
to infer that Zira is her name
270
or some phrase
in her language?
271
Infer what you will,
Mr. Chairman.
272
I suggest you
rephrase the question.
273
What is your name?
274
Zi-ra!
275
One might as well
be talking to a parrot.
276
A parrot!
277
Mechanical mimicry . Unique in
an ape vocally, without a doubt,
278
but, uh, does
the other one talk?
279
Only when she lets me.
280
281
- Dr. Hasslein?
- No... nothing.
282
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?
283
- What is the male's name, please?
- Cornelius.
284
- My lawfully wedded spouse.
- Wedded?
285
We'll take that up later,
Your Eminence.
286
Cornelius, do you and
your lawfully wedded spouse
287
speak any language
other than English?
288
What is English?
289
I speak the language
taught to me
290
by my father and mother,
who were taught by their
fathers and mothers before them.
291
It has been the language
ofour ancestors
292
for nearly 2,000 years.
293
As to its origins,
who can be sure?
294
Gorillas and orangutans
ofour community believe
295
that God created the ape
in his own image.
296
Nonsense!
297
Cornelius, as an intellectual,
you know damned well
298
the gorillas are a bunch
ofmilitaristic nincompoops.
299
And the orangutans are
a bunch ofblinkered,
300
pseudoscientific geese!
301
As to humans, I've dissect--
302
I've examined thousands of them.
303
And until now, I've only discovered
304
God knows who taught them.
305
Where we come from,
306
apes talk.
307
Humans are dumb.
308
Where do you come from,
Cornelius?
309
I'm not sure.
310
Dr. Milo was sure.
311
Dr. Milo was a genius
well in advance ofhis time.
312
When the spacecraft
first landed on our seaboard,
313
it was Dr. Milo who salvaged it.
314
He studied it
and halfunderstood it.
315
Half?
Was halfenough?
316
It was enough for us to escape
when war became inevitable.
317
Enough for Dr. Milo
to be murdered in your zoo.
318
Enough for my wife and I
to be here now.
319
- From where, Cornelius?
- I told you, I'm not sure.
320
Maybe the female knows.
321
Of course the female knows!
322
We came from your future!
323
That doesn't make any sense.
324
It's the only thing that does.
325
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?
326
Cornelius, you spoke ofwar.
327
- War between whom?
- The gorillas and whoever lives--Iived.
328
- Will live.
- Who won the war?
329
I don't know. Chimpanzees are pacifists.
We stayed at home.
330
- But you left before the war had ended.
- In a spaceship.
331
- Which Dr. Milo learned to navigate.
- Correct.
332
Cornelius.
Did you know Colonel Taylor?
333
No. Is he a soldier?
334
We are peaceful creatures.
335
We are happy to be here.
336
May we be unchained?
337
Here they come.
Gentlemen, do you have--
338
No comment.
No comment.
339
- No comment.
- No comment.
340
- Mr. Chairman, a word.
- I'll give you one-- preposterous.
341
- Well, can you define that,
Mr. Chairman?
- Uh, no, let me just say this.
342
As head of this commission,
it will be our duty to sit through
343
the facts of this bizarre affair
and pass our conclusions
344
onto the president of the United States
for implementation.
345
- What a load ofhogger mogger.
- Dr. Hasslein.
346
- No comment, please.
- How will you advise the president
347
to handle this
unique situation?
348
- No comment.
- All right then, Dr. Hasslein,
349
could you tell us how you
personally would handle it?
350
No, gentlemen,
no comment...yet.
351
Doctor.
352
You were fabulous!
353
You were marvelous.
They loved you. All that applause.
354
But there was a moment--
355
There was when he
started to ask us--
356
Zira!
357
-Cornelius, I think we should tell them.
-No.
358
- But only to Lewis and Stevie.
- Oh, Zira.
359
I have to be honest
with someone.
360
Cornelius, please.
361
You tell them.
362
Well, you see...
363
we did know Colonel Taylor.
364
We came to love him.
365
I don't understand what harm there could
be in telling that to the commission?
366
Where we come from,
367
apes did not love humans.
368
They, uh, hunted them
for sport,
369
much as you would animals.
370
Yes. We use their bodies,
alive and dead,
371
experimentally for
anatomical dissection
372
and scientific research.
373
Well, we do the same thing
to animals.
374
I mean, as a scientist,
I sympathize,
375
but I agree that that's a revelation
the masses would not take kindly to.
376
I think you did the right thing
in denying knowledge of colonel Taylor.
377
- There was another reason.
- Stevie: What?
378
They would have asked
ifhe was still alive.
379
- And is he?
- Oh, no, no, no, he can't be.
380
Well, how did you know?
381
Because
382
from the windows
of the spaceship...
383
we saw the Earth...
384
destroyed.
385
Stand by.
386
Good evening, this is Bill Bonds
reporting from Los Angeles
387
where the biggest story since
the moon landing broke this morning
when 2 apes talked.
388
I repeat, talked to the
Presidential Commission of lnquiry .
389
With me this evening in the studio
is Dr. Otto Hasslein.
390
He is a senior scientific advisor
at the White House.
391
And he'll be giving us his views
on the crucial statement
392
made at this
morning's session.
393
Dr. Hasslein, as I recall,
when you asked the male ape
394
where he was from,
395
the female replied,
"From your future."
396
- Yes.
- Would you believe that?
397
Absolutely. I think
it is the only explanation.
398
Well, maybe the explanation
needs some explaining now.
399
You've written several
learned dissertations
400
on the nature of time.
401
Could you explain in terms that
our viewers at home will understand?
402
How, for instance,
a person, or persons,
403
could travel from
time past to time future
404
or, indeed, vice versa?
405
Mr. Bonds, I think that time
can only be fully understood
406
by an observer with a godlike gift
ofinfinite regression.
407
Could you explain
infinite regression for us?
408
- Roll the film.
- I'd more than happy to.
409
As a matter offact,
I came prepared to do just that.
410
Now here's a painting
of a landscape.
411
The artist who
painted that picture
412
says something is missing--
what is it?
413
"It is I myself, who was part
of the landscape I painted."
414
So he mentally takes
a step backward, or regresses,
415
and paints a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the landscape.
416
But still something is missing-- and
that something is still his real self
417
painting the second picture.
418
So he regresses further
and paints a third.
419
A picture of the artist
painting a picture
420
of the artist painting
a picture of the landscape.
421
But because something
is still missing,
422
he paints
a fourth and a fifth
423
until he paints
a picture of the artist
424
painting a picture of the artist
painting a picture of the artist
425
painting a picture of the artist
painting a landscape.
426
So infinite regression then is--
427
It is the moment when our artist
has regressed to the point ofinfinity,
428
and himself, becomes part
of the landscape he painted
429
and is both the observer
and the observed.
430
Well, now in that
peculiar condition,
431
what would he be observing
ifhe were observing, let's say, time?
432
He would perceive, Mr. Bonds,
that time is like a freeway
433
with an infinite
number oflanes,
434
all leading from
the past into the future,
435
however, not unto the same future.
436
A driver in lane "A" may crash
while a driver in lane "B" survives.
437
It follows that a driver,
by changing lanes can change his future.
438
Now, Mr. Bonds, I do not
find it diffcult to believe
439
that in the dark and turbulent
corridors ofouter space,
440
the impact ofsome distant planetary ,
even galactic disaster,
441
jumped the apes from
their present into ours.
442
Indeed, the prooflies
in their arrival among us.
443
And in their spoken,
and I repeat spoken testimony.
444
Thank you very much,
Dr. Hasslein.
445
It's certainly the most incredible story
this reporter has ever covered.
446
I think that by their intelligence
and their good humor,
447
the 2 so-called "ape-o-nauts"
have already captured the hearts
448
of the entire American nation.
449
They will not be required
450
to appear before
the commission tomorrow.
451
That hearing, of course,
is going to be held in private.
452
They will, however, be taken
from the zoo infirmary to a hotel,
453
and they will be given
an extended tour of the city.
454
This is Bill Bonds reporting
for Eyewitness News.
455
- Good night.
- Good night.
456
457
458
- Your luggage, ma'am?
- Of course, it's mine!
459
Address, please.
460
- The zoo.
-
461
462
May I measure
your inside leg, sir?
463
- No.
- Oh.
464
Dr. Cornelius, tell me,
how do you find our women?
465
Very human.
466
Very good.
Very good.
467
Excuse me.
468
Madam Zira, I represent Furand Feather,
a pet magazine.
469
Do you think I'm a pet?
470
Well, yes, I do, rather.
471
- Say, why don't you try some?
- What is it?
472
Well, it's sort of
like grape juice plus.
473
Wait! Just a sip!
474
Madam Zira,
what is your favorite fruit?
475
Grape.
476
And that's the way
it was tonight
477
at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
478
- Ha ha ha.
- Tomorrow, Zira is to speak
479
at the Bay Area's Women's Club.
480
And later, she'll accompany Dr. Hasslein
to the Museum of Natural History .
481
Meanwhile, Cornelius will attend
a prizefight. That's his first one.
482
Later, he'll visit Disneyland
483
to dedicate a new boat
for theJungle Cruise.
484
Now, for a look
at the weather.
485
Sunny California will not
be exactly that tomorrow.
486
Clouds will cover the coastal area
with light showers predicted.
487
The downtown--
488
489
- Tired?
- A little.
490
- How is that?
- Soothing...
491
but very wet.
492
493
A marriage bed
is made for two,
494
but every damn morning
it's the woman who has to make it!
495
We have heads
as well as hands.
496
I call upon men
to let us use them!
497
498
How do you like it,
Cornelius?
499
Beastly.
500
A giant flesh-eating dinosaur.
501
Now, its scientific name
is a compound
502
of the greek antron
which means "hollow"
503
and dimas which
means "body frame."
504
Referring to
the backbone or vertebrae.
505
Now, this little fellow
is Camptosaurus Marsh,
506
a primitive duckbilled dinosaur.
507
Its scientific name is
a compound of the greek kampto,
508
which means
"flexible or bent,"
509
and sauros,
which means "Iizard."
510
Its generic name,
therefore, is "flexible lizard."
511
In 1 879, O.C. Marsh
of yale University
512
described the first known species
513
from the Jurassic beds
of arikoma.
514
Since then,
other specimens have been found--
515
- It must have been the shock.
- Shock, my foot!
516
I'm pregnant.
517
I shan't leave you
until Cornelius is back.
518
- No, no, no, no!
- No, I insist. Please sit down.
519
Now, is there anything
I can get you, Zira?
520
Well, I have a strange craving.
521
That is only natural.
522
For grape juice plus.
523
Grape juice plus?
524
It's in the--
the refrigerator.
525
All right.
526
Is this it?
527
Here we go.
528
Lewis said only a sip.
529
Zira, it is an excellent restorative,
I assure you.
530
Especially in cases ofpregnancy,
you know.
531
- How long have you known?
- Oh, since well before the war.
532
Mmm.
533
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Uh-uh.
534
Oh, no, I shouldn't,
not in your condition.
535
Who won your war?
536
It wasn't our war.
537
It was the gorillas' war.
538
Chimpanzees are passion--
539
pacifists!
540
We stayed behind.
We never saw the enemy.
541
But which side won?
542
Neither.
543
But how do you know that
if you weren't there, Zira?
544
When we were in space,
545
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.
546
Then we saw the rim
of the Earth melt.
547
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.
548
Wooo.
549
I feel magnificently sleepy.
550
The date meter
on the spaceship.
551
What did it read
af ter Earth's destruction?
552
553
554
And before-- before
the white light and the tornado?
555
556
557
something.
558
Before the white light
and the tornado?
559
Zira: 39...
560
561
something.
562
- So?
- So you have evidence, Mr. President,
563
that one day, talking apes
will dominate this Earth
564
and eventually destroy it
by 3950 something.
565
I doubt that we shall
still be in office by then.
566
And according
to the NASA experts,
567
who are still subjecting the spaceship
to microscopic scrutiny,
568
the precise year
ofwhat you merely inferred
569
to be Earth's destruction
is recorded on the flight synthesizer
570
as 3955 A.D., presumably.
571
Now, what do you expect me
and the United Nations--
572
though not necessarily
in that order--
573
to do about it?
574
Alter what you believe to be
the course of the future
575
by slaughtering 2 innocents?
576
Or rather 3, now that
one of them is pregnant.
577
Herod tried that,
and Christ survived.
578
Mr. President,
Herod lacked our facilities.
579
He also became very unpopular,
historically unpopular.
580
And we don't want
that to happen, do we?
581
I am saying that our 2 visitors seem
to be charming, peaceful people--
582
or rather creatures--
and that the voters love them.
583
Do you want them and their progeny
to dominate the world, Mr. President?
584
Well, not at
the next election, no.
585
But, one day,
if the progeny turn out
586
as well as the parents,
who knows,
587
they may do a betterjob ofit
than we have.
588
By destroying the world?
589
Are you quite sure that what
they saw destroyed was the world?
590
- Well, aren't you?
- I consider it dispassionately
591
as a possibility,
not hysterically as a fact.
592
Mr. President, we have their own
testimony that they provoked the war.
593
And they seemed to have provoked
you pretty thoroughly into the bargain.
594
I'm not saying that you're wrong,
Hasslein, but I am saying
595
that before I have them shot
against the wall, I want convincing
596
that the handwriting on the wall
is calculably true.
597
Now... convince me.
598
By their own testimony we know
that apes one day will acquire
599
the power of
intelligent speech.
600
By Zira's testimony, we know
that she is pregnant with child.
601
By my own testimony we know
that it's genetically possible
602
for this child-- provided, of course,
always that we permit its birth--
603
to bear or beget
a talking ape by a dumb one
604
in a present-dayjungle
or a present-day zoo.
605
Do you truly believe that
by deliberate present-day action
606
we can neutralize
that possibility?
607
- That we can alter the future?
- Yes, Mr. President, I do.
608
Do you also believe
that we should?
609
Given the power to alter the future,
have we the right to use it?
610
I don't know.
611
I've wrestled with this, Mr. President.
I just don't know.
612
How many futures are there?
Which future has God, if there is a God,
613
chosen for man's destiny?
614
If I urged the destruction
of these 2 apes,
615
am I defy ing God's will
or obeying it?
616
Am I His enemy
or His instrument?
617
An assassin would say the latter.
618
- Do you approve of assassination?
- Well, Mr. President,
619
we condoned the attempted assassination
of Hitler because he was evil.
620
Yes, but would we have
approved killing him
621
in babyhood when
he was still innocent?
622
Or killing his mother when
he was still in her womb?
623
Or slaughtering
his remote ancestors?
624
We have no proof, Hasslein,
that these apes are evil.
625
- Mr. President,
there are very strong indications.
- Such as.
626
There were hesitancies
and small discrepancies in
their answers to the commission.
627
Which suggests to me that
if they were properly interrogated--
628
Are you suggesting that they
were improperly interrogated?
629
- Let us say unprofessionally.
- You want it professional?
630
- The full works, Mr. President.
- Tell that to the commission.
631
I'll abide by their findings.
632
Having convened in secret session
at the request of the president,
633
the commission makes
the following interim recommendations--
634
" 1 . The public
should be informed
635
"that the apes, after
their arduous space voyage,
636
"and the fatigue arising
from its intended publicity,
637
"are to be afforded rest and privacy
in a location whose identity
638
"will not be divulged
to the public.
639
"2. Since, however,
640
"there is justifiable cause
for suspecting
641
"that they have withheld vital
information from this commission,
642
"the 'ape-o-nauts' will, in fact,
be escorted by Dr. Lewis Dixon
643
"to the installation
known as Camp 1 1 .
644
"Held there in his care
for interrogation by the CIA
645
under the guidance and supervision
of Dr. Otto Hasslein."
646
Zira:
When we were in space,
647
we saw bright, white,
blinding light.
648
Brighter than this?
649
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
650
Zira: Then we saw
the rim of the Earth melt.
651
Then there was
a tornado in the sky.
652
That's your voice, isn't it?
653
How can I tell?
I don't even remember.
654
Why don't you remember?
655
Because Dr. Hasslein
made me drunk!
656
Why did you tell something
to Dr. Hasslein when drunk
657
that you never told
the commission when sober?
658
Because you and your husband
were frightened
659
for the safety of yourselves
and your unborn child?
660
I withheld nothing.
Nobody asked me.
661
But ifsomebody had asked...
662
I should have said
that chimpanzees
663
had no part in
the destruction of Earth.
664
Only the gorillas
and the orangutans.
665
What's the difference?
You're all monkeys.
666
Please do not use
the word monkey.
667
It is offensive to us.
As an archaeologist,
668
I had access to history scrolls
which were kept secret from the masses
669
and I suspect that the weapon
which destroyed Earth
670
was man's own invention.
671
I do know this: one of the reasons
for man's original downfall
672
was your peculiar habit
ofmurdering one another.
673
Man destroys man.
Apes do not destroy apes.
674
Cornelius.
675
This is not
an interracial hassle,
676
but a search for facts.
677
We do not deny the possibility
ofman's decline and fall.
678
All we want to find out
is how apes rose.
679
Well...
680
it began in our prehistory
681
with the plague
that fell upon dogs.
682
- And cats.
- Hundreds and thousands of them died,
683
and hundreds and thousands of them
had to be destroyed
684
in order to prevent
the spread ofinfection.
685
- There were dog bonfires.
- Yes. And by the time
686
the plague was contained,
man was without pets.
687
Of course, for man,
this was intolerable.
688
I mean, he might
kill his brother,
689
but he could not kill his dog.
690
So humans took
primitive apes as pets.
691
Zira:
Primitive and dumb,
692
but still 20 times more intelligent
than dogs or cats.
693
Correct.
694
They were quartered in cages,
but they lived
695
and moved freely
in human homes.
696
They became responsive
to human speech,
697
and in the course ofless
than 2 centuries,
698
they progressed from
performing mere tricks
699
to performing services.
700
Nothing more or less than
a well-trained sheepdog could do.
701
Could a sheepdog cook
or clean the house
702
or do the marketing for the groceries
with a list from its mistress
703
or wait on tables?
704
Or after 3 more centuries,
turn the tables on their owners?
705
How?
706
They became alert to
the concept ofslavery ,
707
and, as their numbers grew,
to slavery 's antidote,
708
which, of course, is unity.
709
Well, at first,
they began assembling in small groups.
710
They learned the art of corporate
and militant action.
711
They learned to refuse.
712
At first, theyjust
grunted their refusal.
713
But then,
on an historic day
714
which is commemorated
by my species
715
and fully documented
in the sacred scrolls,
716
there came Aldo.
717
He did not grunt.
718
He articulated.
719
He spoke a word which
had been spoken to him
720
over time without number
by humans.
721
He said...
722
"No."
723
So that's how
it all started.
724
Clip one, please.
725
Cornelius:
Where we come from, apes talk.
726
Humans are dumb.
727
You recognize your husband's words
to the commission?
728
Yes.
729
So humans were dumb.
Were they happy?
730
Clip two.
731
Zira:
As to humans, I've dissect--
732
I've examined thousands of them.
733
And until now,
I've only discovered
734
735
Why did you change words
in the middle of a sentence?
736
Repeat first three seconds
of clip two.
737
Zira: As to humans,
I've dissect-- I've examined--
738
- What was the word you didn't finish?
- I can't remember.
739
- Play the loop.
- Zira: Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--
740
- Complete the word, monkey.
- Look, I have told you--
741
- Complete the word!
- Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--
742
Dissect--Dissect--Dissect--
743
Sounds as if I had hiccups!
744
745
Call for Dr. Dixon, please.
746
Dr. Dixon?
Dr. Hasslein calling Dr. Dixon.
747
P.A.:
Calling Dr. Dixon.
748
Ah, Dr. Dixon. Come in.
749
- Be good enough to administer
this to the female.
- Why? What is it?
750
Sodium Pentothal.
751
- Dr. Hasslein,
I'm an animal psychiatrist.
- And a qualified vet, Dr. Dixon.
752
You have
the commission's authority.
753
And that of the president.
Please.
754
Zira, I've been asked
to give you an injection--
755
You can't use that! We only
use those things for killing.
756
-Killing?
-No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.
757
This is for relaxing.
It won't harm her.
758
- Will it harm my baby?
- No, it won't.
759
So, Zira, if you would
just come with me, please.
760
Lewis, you can't
use that on Zira!
761
- Please, take him to his quarters!
- Really.
762
No, you mustn't!
763
Zira! Zira!
764
Please.
765
Just lie down on the couch.
766
And bare your arm, please.
767
You don't have to tell me!
768
This has the same effect
as grape juice plus.
769
Now count backward from 1 0.
770
771
772
773
774
What comes after 4?
775
776
- Thank you, Dr. Dixon.
- It's customary to stay.
777
- Zira.
- Hmm.
778
You worked
in a room like this.
779
Hmm...
780
Bigger. Not so pretty.
781
And there you practiced--
782
Comparative.
783
Comparative what?
784
- An--an--an--
- Anatomy?
785
- Anata--
- Whose anatomies did you compare?
786
Apes and humans?
787
Zira, say yes
if you mean yes.
788
- Yes.
- So you dissected other apes?
789
Ye--yes...
790
when they died
a natural death.
791
And humans, too, of course.
792
Yes...
793
as they were made available.
794
- Available?
- Gorillas hunted them for sport
795
in nets and with guns.
796
The survivors were put in cages.
797
The army used some
for target practice.
798
We could pick from the rest.
799
In the interest ofscience,
you dissected, removed,
800
and statistically compared...
801
bones, muscles, tendons,
veins, arteries,
802
kidneys, livers, hearts,
803
stomachs, reproductive organs,
804
nails, tongues, eyes,
805
noses, nervous systems,
806
the various reflexes.
807
Reflexes?
808
Of the dead?
809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of the living.
810
You can't make
a dead man's knee jump
811
any more than you can test
a corpse's reaction to a lobotomy.
812
You were advanced enough
813
to perform experimental
brain surgery on living humans?
814
Oh, yes.
We even tried to stimulate
815
their atrophied speech centers.
816
Did you try to stimulate
817
Colonel Taylor's speech centers?
818
Of course not.
He could talk already.
819
When you left,
was Colonel Taylor alive?
820
We loved Taylor.
821
We did all we could
to help him--
822
Cornelius and l.
823
Cornelius!
824
She needs a nap.
825
She'll get it.
826
Orderly.
827
- Sir?
- Take the female ape to its quarters.
828
We must get this
to the commission.
829
-
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
830
I've received an off cial notification
from the president
831
ratify ing the final recommendations
made by this commission
832
in light of
the tape recordings
833
delivered by Dr. Hasslein.
834
If you'll be seated,
we'll get down to business.
835
Now, let me review
our conclusions.
836
" 1 . By a majority vote,
837
"the commission finds
no solid evidence for hostility
838
"by either ape
towards the human race
839
as it is presently constituted
in this year, 1 973."
840
- I disagree--
- Let me remind you
841
that this was
by a majority vote.
842
"The male's attitude is that
843
"of a deeply interested academician
844
"who studied the alleged future
downfall of the human race
845
"with the true objectivity
of a good historian.
846
"The female's case is different,
847
"in that she undoubtedly committed
848
"actions against the human race
849
"of a sort which,
if committed today,
850
"would be called atrocities,
851
"but would they be so called
in 2,000 years' time,
852
"when it is alleged that humans
853
"will have become dumb brutes
854
"with the intelligence of animals?
855
"It's been noted that
what apes will do to humans
856
"is no more than what humans
now do to beasts.
857
"Nonetheless,
the commission is sympathetic
858
"to Dr. Hasslein's conviction
that these apes' progeny
859
"could, in centuries to come,
860
"prove an increasing threat
to the human race
861
"and conceivably end
by dominating it.
862
"This is a risk
we dare not ignore.
863
"Therefore...
864
"the commission
unanimously recommends
865
"that the birth
of the female's unborn child
866
"should be prevented
867
"and that after
its prenatal removal,
868
"both the male and the female
869
"should humanely
be rendered incapable
870
ofbearing another."
871
I now declare
this commission dissolved.
872
Savages!
873
They are savages!
874
Jabbing needles
into my pregnant wife.
875
I've done that too, dear,
876
and worse.
877
Taylor thought
we were savages at first.
878
Did they make you tell them
about Taylor too?
879
They made me tell them
everyt hing, Cornelius.
880
- Brutes.
- Shall I tell you something?
881
I'm glad I did.
We can't live with lies.
882
After this, I doubt
we shall be allowed to live at all.
883
Do you mean that?
884
Ohh...
885
How long?
886
A week.
887
Maybe sooner.
888
They treated you like dirt.
889
-
- Ma'am, sir.
890
Chow time.
891
I'm not hungry .
892
Well, maybe somebody else is
who can't talk yet.
893
Oh, come on, ma'am.
It's pure vitamin C.
894
You better drink the soup
and eat the oranges
895
- for that little monkey--
- Grr!
896
What have you done,
Cornelius?
897
Nobody makes a fool
out ofmy wife.
898
We just ought to leave.
899
I'll be going back
with Dr. Hasslein soon.
900
I have to tell them.
901
- You've got to come help me.
- I'll come right away.
902
Itjust seems so cruel
and horrible and-- I don't know.
903
I'll see you.
904
- Cruel, Dr. Dixon?
- Unbelievably.
905
Zira wants her baby.
906
- So do l.
- But dead.
907
- Yes.
- You'd prefer the parents dead too.
908
Shall we go?
909
910
Gate four.Just a minute, sir.
I'll take a look.
911
No, sir. The lieutenant
hasn't checked in yet.
912
- Good night, Charlie.
- Night, Ed.
913
Yes, sir.
I'll give him that message.
914
"Contact the motor pool."
As soon as I see him.
915
916
-
- Gate four.
917
Oh, yes, Captain.
918
The supply truck isn't
due until 0600 hours.
919
- Well, I'm sorry , sir.
- Good night, Charlie.
920
I said, "good night."
921
We can't contact them
until then.
922
Well, the depot's closed, sir.
923
Okay, sir.
I'll be off duty,
924
but the relief
comes on at 0430 hours.
925
I'll have him pass
the message. Yes, sir.
926
Zira, what's the matter?
927
I...
928
I think my pains have begun.
929
Oh, my dear.
930
Administration, Doctor.
It's urgent.
931
- What happened?
- The apes killed their orderly.
932
- Where are they?
- On the run.
933
Now they've killed.
For that, they must be killed.
934
It has to be done
before we start a stone rolling
935
that'll gather enough
poison moss to kill us all!
936
Look.
I'll go back to camp.
937
- I'll find Lewis and get help.
- No. No.
938
I just lost my temper
with the boy.
939
- It's better now. I can walk.
- Listen to me.
940
They may punish us
for what we did,
941
but at least the baby
will be born.
942
- Were they armed?
- No, I don't believe so.
943
Then there's no need
for a shooting match.
944
Not strictly speaking.
945
I am speaking strictly,
Hasslein.
946
Science regards
these apes as unique.
947
People regard them
as practically human.
948
The killers of today
could become
949
the mass murderers of tomorrow.
950
I can think ofno one
better equipped emotionally
951
to persuade the people
of that possibility,
952
but, in a democracy,
we do not shoot
953
unarmed suspects on sight
for a murder
954
in which their participation
is still legally unproven.
955
I want them taken, yes,
but taken alive.
956
Is that clear?
957
Quite clear, Mr. President.
958
You lost, miss?
959
Oh, it's you, Dr. Branton.
960
Be careful.
There's been a murder.
961
- Murder?
- The monkeys have killed
their orderly and escaped.
962
What? I don't believe it.
How did it happen?
963
All I know is they've
killed their orderly,
964
And I've been given orders
to find them. Drive carefully.
965
There will be a lot
ofvehicles in the area.
966
Cornelius, what have you done?
967
I didn't mean to kill him.
968
He was teasing Zira.
I hit him with a tray.
969
- Please believe me.
- I do, Cornelius, but they won't.
970
- Where's Zira?
- She's back there.
She's hiding in the bushes.
971
Stevie... she's in labor.
972
Oh, God. Get in.
973
Stevie, you won't
take us back to the camp?
974
Get down.
I have a better idea.
975
Now, wait a second.
Just a moment.
976
Let me get this straight.
977
You are asking me
to risk imprisonment
978
for the sake of two
fugitive apes?
979
The answer is
a thousand times... yes.
980
Oh, yes.
I do it for you
981
and for Stevie
982
and for your two
distinguished friends.
983
- Uh, notorious now.
- The hell with notoriety.
984
What is a husband
expected to do?
985
Stand by and see
his wife insulted?
986
Aren't we rude
enough to each other
987
without having to be
rude to animals?
988
Anyway, he didn't mean
to kill the boy.
989
Los trato bien, muchachos?
990
Si, patron. Salud!
991
I sure appreciate
what you're doing.
992
You helped deliver
our last baby.
993
Now you will deliver our next.
994
Lewis!
What took you so long?
995
I had to make some excuse.
They think I'm searching.
996
- Armando's been a saint.
- Saint Francis would have
fixed it better.
997
- Never.
- Say hello to Heloise
998
and your goddaughter Salome.
999
- Hello, Salome.
- The first chimp ever born in a circus.
1000
Los Angeles has had four.
1001
Los Angeles isn't a circus.
It's a zoo.
1002
So New Yorkers say.
1003
Lewis is here.
1004
Lewis, I was not responsible
for the death--
1005
I know, but you will be responsible
for a birth. How is she?
1006
The pains are coming
every five minutes.
1007
Every four.
1008
1009
- Look. Look at Heloise.
-
1010
She's showing an expectant mother
what to expect.
1011
Mama. Mama.
1012
Say it. Mama.
1013
- Mama.
- Zira.
1014
Zira, don't waste your breath.
1015
You know the child
of two primitive apes
1016
will never learn how to speak.
1017
I'm getting into practice.
1018
Mama. Mama.
1019
Mam--
1020
There. That's good.
1021
Come on. Over here.
1022
What are we going to call...
1023
- Him.
- him?
1024
Milo?
1025
Milo.
1026
Milo.
1027
- Milo.
- Congratulations.
1028
Oh.
1029
1030
- No?
- No.
1031
- But, sir--
- Captain, I'm aware
that you've canvassed
1032
the areas we first established.
1033
Evidently, we were wrong
because you haven't found them!
1034
Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, can you pinpoint
1035
the probable date of the baby's birth
with any degree of accuracy?
1036
Well, I never examined her,
but from appearances
1037
I'd say a week to 1 0 days.
1038
If that's close,
she can't have gone far.
1039
- Where do apes go?
- To other apes.
1040
Of course. Captain, I want you
to start an immediate search
1041
ofevery menagerie,
zoo, and circus.
1042
I'll augment your force
with the city police,
1043
and I want to be kept informed
about all results.
1044
- Yes, sir.
-
1045
- Lewis will think ofsomething.
- I am so sorry .
1046
I had planned it so well.
1047
In one month, we move on
to our winter quarters in Florida.
1048
I could have released you
in the Everglades.
1049
You might have lived
happily ever af ter.
1050
But now...
what can I do?
1051
You have done enough
to make us grateful forever.
1052
I did it because
I like chimpanzees best of all apes,
1053
and you,
the best of all chimpanzees.
1054
I did it because I hate those
who try to alter destiny
1055
which is the unalterable
will ofGod.
1056
Ifit is man's destiny
1057
one day to be dominated,
1058
Iet him be dominated by you.
1059
All I can now do
to help you
1060
is give you this
for the baby.
1061
It's a medal of
Saint Francis of assisi.
1062
- Who is he?
- He was a holy man
1063
who loved and cared for animals.
1064
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.
1065
We'll hang it around
the baby's neck
1066
for protection, huh?
1067
- Thank you.
- Yes.
1068
And now, my dear,
dear friends,
1069
before the police come
and the audience gathers,
1070
you and your pretty baby must go.
1071
Lewis is on his way.
1072
- Armando.
- Yes?
1073
I should like to say good-bye
to Heloise first.
1074
Ifshe could speak,
she'd say she's sorry .
1075
I know, but we
understand each other.
1076
All right.
All right.
1077
This is as far
as we dare to take you.
1078
The police have roadblocks
on every main exit.
1079
- Here are your supplies.
- Thank you.
1080
Can you read a map?
1081
I'm an archaeologist.
I can even draw one.
1082
We're at the city limits
1083
at the southern edge
of this oil field.
1084
Over this hill,
you'll pass through
1085
more oil wells,
an abandoned refinery ,
1086
and you'll be looking
down at a harbor.
1087
It's a graveyard
for old ships.
1088
I played there as a kid.
1089
There's a derelict tanker
at one end.
1090
- You can hide there for a week.
- A week?
1091
Until the commotion dies down and
we can smuggle you back to the circus.
1092
Then you can travel
with them to Florida,
1093
found a colony in the Everglades,
and live happily ever after.
1094
1095
Mama. Mama.
1096
Mama.
1097
It's time that
you were moving on.
1098
- Lewis.
- Yes?
1099
If they find us,
we shall be killed?
1100
Ultimately.
1101
Then, uh...give us
the opportunity
1102
to kill ourselves
1103
if that moment should come.
1104
Please.
1105
I shouldn't do this,
1106
but I guessed you might ask.
1107
You're the second human
I've kissed.
1108
And you are the first.
1109
Come along, Zira.
Now, don't dawdle.
1110
The ape with the kid?
1111
She's been with
the circus seven years now.
1112
The baby's birth was
registered 1 6 days ago.
1113
Look how he's growing.
1114
The first chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus!
1115
Do you realize what
a distinction that is?
1116
It's like being
the first fish born on land.
1117
- Nothing.
- It's like being the first bird
born without an egg,
1118
the first baby born
on the moon.
1119
It's like being--
1120
Ha ha ha!
1121
Negative! Negative!
Negative!
1122
We'll catch them
sooner or later.
1123
Later we'll do something
about pollution.
1124
Later we'll do something
about the population explosion.
1125
Later we'll do something
about nuclear war.
1126
We think we've got all
the time in the world!
1127
How much time
has the world got?
1128
Somebody has to
begin to care.
1129
Ah! Like stars in space.
1130
Isn't it beautiful?
1131
Yes, it is...
1132
from here.
1133
Well...ha ha ha!
1134
We must move on.
1135
Hmm...
1136
1137
- Who found it?
- The field superintendent.
1138
Routine service check.
It was hidden in the workings.
1139
- She didn't need this anymore.
- Why don't we get moving?
1140
- We've called in for helicopters.
- How long till they get here?
1141
They're running down
1142
a fire report
in the Simi Valley.
1143
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.
1144
- What's the matter?
- They found Zira's suitcase.
1145
1146
Did Lewis really play here?
1147
It was probably cleaner then.
1148
It stinks... ofman.
1149
Oh, no, no, no.
1150
That's oil and dead fish.
1151
Is that what man
wanted oil for--
1152
to kill fish?
1153
You don't like them
very much, do you?
1154
- Who?
- Humans.
1155
We've met hundreds
since we've been here,
1156
and I trust...
1157
three.
1158
Mama. Mama.
1159
Mama.
1160
He wants feeding.
1161
Oh, yes, well, um...
1162
there must be someplace
cleaner than this.
1163
I'll look around.
1164
Zira:
Cornelius?
1165
Cornelius?
1166
I see you've had
your baby, Zira.
1167
The Presidential Commission has
empowered me to take it in my care.
1168
Give it to me.
1169
1170
Cornelius!
1171
1172
Spread your men out
along the pier!
1173
All right, men!
Move out!
1174
- Get them down there!
- Move! Move! Go!
1175
Down to the end!
1176
All right! Let's go!
1177
1178
Stevie.
1179
Zira.
1180
I want that baby. If you won't
give it to me, I'll shoot.
1181
1182
My God! Stop him!
1183
1184
Aah!
1185
-
- No!
1186
1187
Keep your men here!
Come on!
1188
Zira!
1189
What's she doing?
1190
Oh, my God.
1191
Armando:
All hands on the guy lines.
1192
Drop the bale ring!
1193
All extra hands
in the back yard.
1194
Come on! Let's go!
1195
When you get
that canvas packed,
1196
I want every hand
on the menagerie tent.
1197
Intelligent creature.
1198
But then, so were
your mother and father.
1199
1200
Mama.
1201
Mama. Mama.
1202
Mama. Mama.
1203
Mama. Mama.
1204
Mama. Mama.
1205
Mama. Mama!
