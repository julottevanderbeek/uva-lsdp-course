There's a hundred and four
days of summer vacation
Hey!
Or giving a monkey a shower
Creating nano-bots or
locating Frankenstein's brain
It's over here!
Phineas!
As you can see, there's a
whole lot of stuff to do
Come on, Perry!
So stick with us, 'cause Phineas
and Ferb are gonna do it all!
So stick with us, 'cause Phineas
and Ferb are gonna do it all!
Mom, Phineas and Ferb
are making a title sequence!
This was nice. Yeah, I'm
glad we ran into each other.
Yeah. Almost literally. You barely
missed me with your scooter.
What can I say?
You walk slow.
So, uh, what're you
doing tonight?
Yeah, I'm going to
see Love Sandal.
It's a Love Handle
cover band that, uh,
that plays in sandals.
My cousin plays bass.
He can get us backstage.
It'll be fun.
You wanna come?
Uh, no. No, I don't.
I'll catch you later.
I'll keep an eye out
for that scooter.
Carl!
Let me finish.
Go ahead.
You mean there's more?
Look, you don't have to tell
my dad about this, do you?
Monty, Monty.
Walk with me.
You know,
your dad is my superior.
I'm obliged to
tell him everything.
I can't imagine what
could possibly sway me
to consider such
a dereliction of duty.
All right, Carl, I get it.
What do you want?
I want your father to
disown you and adopt me!
Okay, what do you
want within reason?
You don't understand.
I do all the work
at the agency,
but he doesn't even
acknowledge me.
I mean, that's all I want,
a simple "thank you."
Is that too
much to ask?
You just want him
to say "thank you"?
Yes, a simple
"thank you."
Carl, if that's all
you want then
I'm sure I can get Dad to
say "thank you" to you.
Well, if you
can do that,
maybe I can just
forget to mention
the whole dating a sworn
enemy's daughter thing.
Deal.
Hey, Ferb. Check
out this cool picture
of Grandma and Grandpa Flynn in
their pyramid water-skiing days.
Wow, it's all the fun of
water-skiing times 10.
Y'know, I bet you pyramids
would make any sports better.
Ferb?
What do you
two think you...
Doing?
Oh hey, Candace.
What?
I said, hey, Candace.
What? I can't hear you
over all this ringing.
Don't worry
about it.
It'll go away in a sec.
See ya later, Candace.
I may not be able to hear
you, but I can see you.
If you stay in range.
Hello, Candace!
Right on schedule.
Uh, hi. Are you new here?
Heavens no, dear. I've
been here all summer.
I've so enjoyed
watching your brothers
build so many amazing
things every day.
Oh, that's perfect.
Ugh! You know what, my arms
are getting really tired.
Just hold that thought
I'll be right back.
You were saying?
They're so inventive.
I mean, they built
that roller coaster.
Oh, and that spa.
And I love that
platypus-themed restaurant.
Even though I couldn't
get a reservation.
The bouncer was so harsh.
Oh, but the best was when
they had their own sitcom.
Wait, I wasn't even
here for that one.
I know, but I wouldn't
miss a minute
of witnessing your
brother's backyard fun.
Lady, you've got to help me.
You've got to come down here
and tell my mom all about it!
Oh, I don't think so, dear.
Um, I just don't feel up
to leaving the house.
No problem! You stay
right where you are,
and I'll bring
my mom over!
Oh, by the way.
What?
Where's Perry?
CHORUS:
Hey, Dad.
Monty, my boy.
It's always wonderful
to see you.
Hello, sir.
Carl, what took
you so long?
Hand me that report
there, would you?
Yes, sir.
My coffee. Hah!
Thanks, Monty.
Argh!
Actually, Carl...
Carl, the trash chute is clogged again.
Do you mind?
Of course not, sir.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.
Good morning, Agent P.
Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been
spotted on his balcony
repeatedly shaking his fist and then
running back into his building.
So, go and stop him from
his cartoon conventions.
That is sweeping the nation
with pyramid formation
Here's how you play.
Try any sport now experiment
I don't care if it's played
in a field or on a court,
'cause everyone here
is into pyramid sports.
I think I pulled
my sigmoid colon.
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Annoying musician?
C'mon. C'mon. Come to pappa.
Ah, bingo! Hey, what's
with the waffle?
Oh, very funny, Perry the Platypus.
Very funny!
If you'll just be so kind as to
move your tail out of the way.
Thank you. There we go.
That's good.
See, now you're
just being childish.
Look, I promise you, I'm not
even being marginally evil.
I just want to stop that guy
from playing his bagpipes.
Every day, 24 hours a day.
I mean, look at him!
On what planet is that
racket considered music?
Ugh, I cannot
take it anymore
so I'm gonna hit his bagpipe
with my Inflatinator.
Yeah, I know, it's basically the
opposite of my old Deflatinator.
But I can't concentrate
with all that noise.
I was lucky to
come up with that.
But when that
bagpipe blows up,
I will once again be able to
hear the usual din ringing
through the city streets.
Like car alarms
and babies crying.
And inators blowing up.
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! This
time I've got an eyewitness!
Go on, go on.
Tell my mom everything!
Well, when the empty
window feels like talking,
you let me know.
There it is.
I dropped my penny.
Did you say
something, dear?
MONTY: How was your meal, Dad?
Absolutely delicious.
What a great
new place.
I know, right?
Carl found it.
Well, then. Let me
just say, thank you,
to the chef.
Thank you, for
that delicious meal.
You're most welcome.
So glad you enjoyed it.
Dad, isn't there something you
wanted to say to Carl, as well.
Of course.
What was I thinking?
Don't be rude, Carl.
Thank the chef.
Thank you.
I like this table. And to show my
gratitude, dessert is on the house.
Now, if you'll excuse me. I must
go and fire a member of staff.
Luchenzo, come here!
There, you see? A little
gratitude goes a long way.
Pay attention, Carl.
You could learn something.
Really learn
something from you...
Just chill out.
I got another idea.
Check you out,
Perry the Bloat-a-pus!
Well, this is awkward.
Seriously,
you're gonna...
Well, I'm so glad to
have this helipad installed.
Mmm.
Upsy-daisy.
No really. I swear, the old
lady is there in the window
right now. I swear!
No need to swear.
I'm coming.
There she is!
Funny, Candace, I could
swear your old lady
looks just like
a houseplant.
What?
There you go. A little
thirsty, weren't you?
Oh, wow.
Aw, man, we're not
getting anywhere.
How about we
take a time out?
Wait. Your hat has a
pressure release valve?
Wow! So that's what the inside
of a platypus smells like.
I could have gone my whole
life without knowing that.
Hey!
Aw, man! Another
inator bites the dust.
Now I'm stuck listening to Jerky
MacIrritating across the street, now.
Shh.
What's that? Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll stop.
I didn't realize I
was disturbing you.
Cheery-bye.
Huh. I guess I might
have overthought
that solution
just a little bit.
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!
Whoo!
Ahh!
Whoo!
CARL: This had better work.
Don't worry, Carl. Once
you save my dad's life,
there's no way even he could
avoid thanking you for it.
I hope for your
sake you're right.
Y'know, it's funny
how no one's noticed
a grand piano dangling
precariously over our table.
Well, I also tied up a
couple of violins over there
so it would seem
like a theme.
All right, listen.
So when my dad returns,
I'll excuse myself
and cut the rope
and you push my dad out of the way
of the falling piano. Got it?
Well, let's get to
that dessert menu.
Excuse me, Dad.
It's my turn.
I'll be right back.
You guys start.
Sure, sure. Thank you
for not making us wait.
That bathroom
attendant was lovely.
He gave me mints
and some floss.
I just couldn't
thank him enough.
Watch out, sir!
Dad! Carl!
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm all right too, sir.
Wow, Carl. You saved
my dad's life.
Yes. It's a shame he
couldn't save the table too.
Let's go find the host. No, wait.
What? Seriously?
What?
Dad.
Aren't you going
to thank him?
Oh, well, I didn't
realize, I hadn't.
Thank you for pointing
that out to me, Monty.
Dad!
Oh, uh, yes, right.
Thank you, Carl.
Oh, well, more
dessert for us.
No, it's different
this time!
She promised to come
down and meet us.
Right. My expectations have
been completely reversed.
No! You'll see. She'll
explain everything.
Everything!
Yes! See.
Mom, lady. Lady, Mom.
Now, tell her everything.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...
Take your hands off me, Copper!
I know my rights.
Sorry, Candace. Water
the plant for me.
I don't understand.
What's going on?
Police matter, miss.
What could that sweet old
lady have possibly done?
That "sweet" old lady is
Peggy "The Pyramid" McGee,
the notorious ringleader of
Danville's biggest pyramid scheme.
Pyramid scheme?
That's right. She's been
selling these all over town.
See. These are just flat triangles
painted in perspective!
That's fraud.
I'll be out before the time
her mom serves pie!
Wow, Candace.
I can't believe it.
A pyramid scheme
right under our noses.
Yeah.
Imagine that.
Hey!
Hey, yourself.
I thought, uh...
Yeah, so did I.
But then I figured I couldn't
leave you here to suffer alone.
That's what I like.
Thoughtful and dismissive
simultaneously.
DOOFENSHMIRTZ:  No! Wait, wait, wait!
Is that the Love Sandals?
Whoa! Watch the
hands, lady! Hey!
Hey, Candace. Doing a little
light summer reading, I see.
This is for the book club,
Jeremy and I joined.
We all read the same book, and then
get together and discuss over tea.
Sounds sophisticated.
Yeah, the tea
was my idea.
This week we're
reading,
That's a great book!
It's all about
the Trojan War!
You read this?
BUFORD: We all did.
You're not the only one
with a book club, you know.
I like your idea
about the tea, though.
Ferb, make
a note of that.
The war started because Paris
fell in love with Helen of Troy.
It's so romantic.
Yeah, and Helen could launch a
thousand ships with her face!
My favorite character
was Achilles,
the greatest Greek
warrior of all time.
He had this big
fight with Hector.
He was all,
wham! Bam!
Stab! Stab! Stab!
Cut it out!
Isn't there something
about a wooden horse?
Yeah, the Greek army built
a huge wooden horse
and left it outside
the gates of Troy.
So, they wheeled
it inside the gates.
Hey. How did they get that
big horse in that tiny door?
Buford, just try
imaging a larger door.
Oh, okay. Hang on.
Oh, yeah.
That's better.
Then late at night, the Greeks climbed
out of the horse, opened the gates...
Then it was all, wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.
Cut it out!
Wow, really
sounds exciting.
I better
get started.
Book club is in
three hours. Bye!
Wow. She must
be a fast reader.
What gets me is,
why did the Trojan
War take so long?
If I were Achilles, I could
have taken the city of Troy
like in one afternoon.
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today!
We're gonna finally
recreate the Trojan War.
I'll be Paris because my
name starts with a "P."
And I'll be
Helen because
uh, my name
starts with "I"
which is right
after "H."
And I'll be the
great Achilles!
And I'll be all wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.
Cut it out!
And you can be Hector.
Now get over there.
I'm taking Ferb.
Hey everyone, can I play?
BUFORD: No!
I've got baklava.
Welcome to the
Greek army.
You know who loves history
and historical reenactments.
Hey, where's
your dad?
DAD: So it goes over,
under, around and through.
Oh, lovely.
Time to open the shop.
Hello, Agent P. I see you used
the rabbit-hole entrance.
Freaks the
heck out of intruders.
Anyway, no news
on what Doof is up to yet.
We're still awaiting a surveillance
report from our special CR Unit.
Hey, Carl! Any news
from Team Cockroach?
CARL: Nothing yet, sir. We think
they may have been scattered.
And they say Rome
wasn't built in a day.
Uh, technically, that's not Rome,
that's supposed to be Troy.
If I wanted nerd facts,
I would have kept Baljeet.
In case you are wondering, the word you
are looking for is "impenetrable."
Actually, the word I was
looking for is "decimate."
Fair enough.
Yeah, we're gonna need
a bigger army.
Irving, break out my
recruitin' fustanella.
You mean the
little Greek skirt?
It's a fustanella!
CHORUS:
Coming! Hold on!
Just hold your horses!
Wait... Hello?
Ha! You missed me,
Perry the Platypus!
But I got you!
You see, I was just doing a little
inventory and reorganization
of all the stuff that I've
collected over the last 40 years.
Yeah, I know it's gotten
a little out of hand.
I kinda let it go and Norm's
been in Maui for, like, a month.
So I made
the De-clutterinator.
I was actually gonna
shoot myself with it,
which would make me want to
unclutter everything, and,
uh, then I lost it,
'cause, you know, it's...
It's really cluttered
in here.
So then I hired a nice
young lady named Doreen
to help me get organized, and, well, I
think she may have gotten lost, too.
I haven't seen her in days.
Doreen, are you out there?
DOREEN: So thirsty.
I never approved overtime!
DOREEN: Food.
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to my search for Doreen.
Maybe I'll get lucky and find
the De-clutterinator, too.
Hey, Doreen! Marco!
DOREEN: Water.
Yeah, she really
stinks at this.
Okay, next!
Name?
Balthazar Horowitz.
But you can call me
the Ball Pit Kid.
Any medical problems?
Well, I have
a perforated...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're in.
Get a shield, come
back with it or on it.
Next! Name?
Dimitri Papanicolas.
Any experience being Greek?
Actually, I am Greek.
I was born on the island...
I don't want your life story.
Grab a shield, come
back with it or on it.
Irving, go get
some more baklava.
Come back with it or on it.
I'm on it!
Yeah? Well, get with it.
"Sing, goddess, the anger of
Peleus' son, Achilles..."
"Achilles, and its devastation which
put pains upon the Achaeans...
"Upon the Achaeans, hurled in their
multitude to the house of..."
BUFORD: Hector!
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Buford! I'm trying to
read this...
What the heck is
going on out here?
You've inspired us, Candace!
What do you think?
Are you by any chance re-enacting
the Trojan War? Like in my book?
That's the plan.
Okay. I'll just watch you guys
and take notes for my book club.
Buford, continue.
Heya, Hector! Why don't
you come on down here?
I got something for ya.
Oh, sweet!
I am going down there.
Okay, here I am.
What have you got for me?
BUFORD: Get him!
Oh, no! Not good!
Eat hot chariot, sucker!
Well, so much for Hector.
There was a hottie
named Helen
And she launched a
thousand ships with her face
The Trojans stole Helen!
Agamemnon got mad
'cause that just wasn't right
He said, "Hold your Trojan
horses, now we're having a fight"
And I haven't sacked a village
since at least last Saturday night
And for 10 years
they were all...
Stabbing, and jabbing,
and clashing, and gashing,
And brawling, and mauling,
and trashing, and smashing
When they finally figured out
they couldn't take 'em by force
The Greeks all got together
and they hid in a horse
Bagpipe solo!
You know, bagpipes are sort of
anachronistic for this time...
Quiet, you! Go back
to being vanquished.
Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!
Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy.
Oh, it's all over.
Doreen! Come out, come
out, wherever you are!
I should have...
I should have brought some
bread crumbs or something
to leave behind me
so I could find my way...
Oh, you know what? Better yet, I
should have brought a sandwich,
'cause I am famished.
Hey, where you guys going?
We're not done yet.
BOY 1: I gotta get home.
BOY 2: I've got book club.
I've got
a balalaika lesson.
You know, they've got a word
for what you guys are doing.
Yeah. It's desertion.
No, it's...
Oh, no.
It is desertion.
Irving, get over here.
It's time to execute Plan B.
Plan B?
Yeah, you know the one where you
climb into the decoy and, uh...
Oh, that Plan B.
Get going.
A Trojan platypus?
Come on, Buford, what makes
you think we'd fall for that.
IRVING: I told you,
Buford.
Why did you have me
get in this thing?
Now, we're getting somewhere.
Ha! I bet you didn't
see a Trojan T. rex
with laser-cannon mouth and
laser eyes comin', did you?
Well, he's got me there.
Seriously, if you were just gonna
crush the Trojan platypus,
why did I... Leave me
my simple pleasures.
Now, Ferb,
destroy Troy!
This is why I got
Ferb on my team!
Uh-oh. Looks like
Ferb's goin' off book.
Everyone to
the chariots!
Hang on!
Whoa-ho! Laser-proof.
Nice touch, Ferb.
This is really cool.
Book club starts
in 10 minutes.
I have an idea! Throw that
rope to the other chariot!
Well, that
can't be good.
I guess they knew a T. rex's
weakness is also its Achilles' heel.
That was awesome!
Who won?
This time I think
it was a draw.
Come on, let's go tell
Candace how it ends.
Yeah, and maybe we
can pick up some
Greek frozen
yogurt on the way.
Doreen, come on,
quit kidding around.
Perry the Platypus?
You've found the
De-clutterinator!
Excellent,
okay, shoot me.
Shoot me and I'll clean
this whole place up.
Oh wait.
What?
Oh, it's not plugged in.
Hold on one sec.
My, word! What a mess.
Okay, here's an open socket.
That doesn't sound good.
Oof, I say, I feel the
sudden urge to declutter.
Well, you have to admit it
did get rid of the clutter.
There you are.
Doreen!
What's happening?
My invoice. You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!
And there goes
the last of it!
Lawrence, what are
you doing out here?
Oh, you know, just
tidying up a little.
Well, the yard
looks great!
Come on in the kitchen.
I've got a plate of cake
that needs cleaning up.
I'm your man.
Now that we're all here.
Who wants to go first.
Ooh, me! In general I thought
the Greeks' decoy platypus
was a brilliant idea until it
got smashed by the T. rex!
Its use of lasers to
destroy the city of Troy
really seemed unbeatable until Paris
flew down in his laser chariot.
The flying chariots were
all, pew, pew, pew, pew!
Ga, ga, ga, ga!
And...
Cool!
is truly an epic!
Candace, you didn't
read the book, did you?
I'm so busted.
Oh, that's okay. I don't
think anyone did.
I just come to book
club for the tea.
