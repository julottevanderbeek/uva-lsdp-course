Mylord, it's time, you have to leave.
They will have you arrested.
Bring me some candles,
i'm working late tonight.
But, mylord..
-And a glass of wine, as usual.
The world had no choice but to change...
.. but the revolution has become terror
and me myself will be taken with away.
The certainties make people blind
and mad.
They can tear their hearts apart
and make a beast of theirselves.
In the year 1764...
...the Beast appeared on our grounds
and made it his.
One year later it was known
far beyond our region...
...and people began to think nobody
could ever defeat it.
By his attacks the Gevaudan sunk
deeper and deeper into the darkness.
Stop...
Who are you?
What did he do?
-He's a thief.
And she?
His daughter. A witch.
I healed their horses and they
refuse to pay.
Do not listen.
A word has no meaning here.
Are the horses healed?
-Yes.
Go on.
Welcome in the land of the Beast.
And watch out for wolf-traps.
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...
...en the man called Mani were
hunters nor soldiers.
As taxidermist of the king..
...the Knight in Paris the
reputation of a freeminded and
...intellectual person.
The one who was following him..
...as his shadow was a stranger
nobody knew of.
When evening fell...
...they offered theirselves to
the castle of marquis Apcher...
...who gave them shelter as long as their
mission in Gevaudan would last.
Our people are not afraid of an
ordinairy wolf. The Beast is different.
It flees from men like it knows
it has to..
but it spares women nor children.
Have you seen it?
-No.
How do you know it's an
animal then?
Those who survived gave that
description.
It's much bigger then a wolf
and it doesn't fear bullets.
I understand your scepticism.
I don't believe in monsters either...
...but i had a report made for
you..
...of the crimes of the Beast.
You can judge yourself.
Grandfather said you were
fighting the English in Canada...
Yes. I went there to study
the animals and nature.
...but i came back hurt
and with the grade of captain.
I arranged a hospital for the
victims of the Beast.
In an old abbey.
A women from Lorciere.
She came back from a party
...when the Beast attacked her.
Help came. The Beast vanished...
...but it deformed her face...
Tell me, Knight,
how is Mr Buffon?
And how are things in Paris?
And The Innocent One?
Read about it already?
It is kind of late for philosophy.
You're right. How about the theatre?
Do you know actrices?
What are they performing this winter?
Put it right there.
People say she is curtuous.
I'm not sure if it's true,
but they offered their charmes.
Tell me.
With this your curiousity will be
satisfied.
Mercurius of France.
We only have the Post of Avignon.
I will show you the sleeping room.
He is sleeping over here.
-Good.
Goodnight, Knight.
It's not Versailles,
but the wine is good.
Fat as a pig...
Jackques has seen many wolves.
What attacked him, was not a wolf.
The snout was longer and
the teeth were like knifes.
If it's not a wolf, what is it then?
A devil.
-Knight.
The Beast attacked a women in
Saint-Alban.
There.
Don't worry Knight, nobody is
here.
Stop.
What are they doing here?
Son of a whore.
Goodday, captain.
Sir Marquis.
I greet you. But be careful.
There are traps everywhere.
This is Gregoire de Fronsac,
of the garden of the King.
He wants to see the body of this
unlucky soul.
With your permission ofcourse.
You treated my men merciless
I did not know they were acting
in your command.
They were not.
You did good and I apoligize.
My soldiers are made for war,
not for hunting.
The intestines were emptied and now
there is poison in it.
What kind of gardener are you?
When the Beast is dead,
the king wants it examined...
...and save it in Paris.
I have to stuff it after the hunt.
Now I try getting familiar with it.
With such jaws the animal should
weigh 250 kilos.
This time I will catch it.
Before the first snow I will have it.
If everybody helps,
it can't escape.
Did you see it already?
-Once now.
In 13 months.
I shot it and hit it.
It collapsed but got up instantly again.
We lost it south of the Mouchet.
Did it look like this?
It had somesort of black bar...
with stings Do you understand?
Friends, let me introduce you
the maker of the drawings.
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...
...the man comes from Paris to..
catch the Beast.
His Eminence,
the bisshop of Mende.
His Eminence,
the duke of Moncan
His Eminence,
the count of Morangias...
..and Mrs. Count
and their son Jean-Francois...
...who has traveled a lot too...
Good, mylord.
Thank you, mylord.
Mylord Laffond, our intendant..
..and the priest of Saint-Alban,
Henrie Sardis.
Tell us, mylord...
Are people talking a lot about
the Beast in Paris?
People even sang about it.
-They should prey.
Would captain Duhamel need
Gods help?
Who can without god's help?
Duhamel disguises his soldiers in
women.
To get the Beast. What a strategy.
-Duhamel does all he can.
I think you're obliging.
Duhamel is incapable.
They destroy a lot.
But the Beast is still there.
Like taxes are ment to be
for paying Duhamel...
...I rather give it to my
servants.
What do you think?
Mylord Duke likes carp at,
but he is a good christian.
When you arrived,
they were boring me...
...with the good God and all
that holy talk.
The pope would even have
sent a spy...
...to see if the Beast has anything
to do with the devil.
Excuse me.
Marianne de Morangias.
Difficult, very difficult.
Everybody was breaking their minds
about it.
Who is next?
-Maxime des Forets. Actor.
That will be easy.
-Be careful. He's a Morangias...
Mrs..
-Hello, mylord, we were talking..
Are you Maxime des Forets?
What a pleasure.
Good actors are rare.
The Marquis was talking about you.
-The Marquis?
He wants to have a chronicle written
about his family.
He's thinking about you.
-Is he?
He is in a good mood.
It's now or never.
But act like you don't know and
let him start talking about it.
Mrs. excuse me....
Aren't you ashamed?
-My God. No.
So, Mr. stuffer ... do you like
our region?
Until now i only saw beauties.
Or at least one of them.
Do people talk about girls
this way in the court?
No... Something like this you
should save for the innocent farmers.
I would go to the court if
there were women like you.
Food is being served, Knight.
Let's eat.
I'll follow you.
We were in Saint-Laurent for 12 days
already when we found the most..
..bizarre animal in our nets I ever saw
The indians told me about
holy fish...
...but I was convinced it
was a legend.
I saw a fish with the looks
and size of a trout.
...but it's body was completely covered
with a hairy skin as black as poison.
A hairy trout? You're joking.
-No, mylord.
Salmo Truta Dermopilla,
from Canada.
That is really strange.
-As soft as fur.
Nature is extraordinary.
The water will be cold...
It proves the impossible is
possible sometimes.
With this discovery you earned
a lot of respect.
I doubt he deserves that.
But I admit, Knight,
you got talent as an actor.
If I would have two hands,
I would give an applause.
Jean-Francois.
Please excuse him, mylord.
Your son is right,
Sr. Earl, that animal doesn't exist.
My embalmer in the garden of the
King is very handy.
So you say the Beast does
not exist...
..and we are idiots?
I only say that...
people only used dragons or
squirrels in books or poems.
Lies are sometimes true if
they are being told correctly.
Watch out, mylord. We might not
understand you anymore now.
By the way, are you a
philosopher?
Or worse... an actor?
I think the Knight is mainly
someone from Paris.
Enough about that Beast.
Shall we do some riddles?
I just made a poem.
If Mrs. Earl allows...
If it's not immoral.
-Immoral? No, no.
It's very chaste and sober.
It's not far-fetched.
Just popped into my head.
It's called "The Wolf".
''I did't pay any attention to
it.
Without thinking of evil,
I look at you
Your secret glance strikes me.
The wolf, the wolf, the wolf"
Will I see you again soon?
Do you have any other mystical animals?
-U have an indisputable idea about me.
Allow me to change that.
-Try it.
Will you be attending Duhamel's battue?
-Yes.
I forbid you.
It's far too dangerous.
Obediance is the first virtue
of young women.
That young man is right.
It was on that day the biggest battue
ever to be held in Gevaudan took place.
The King promised 6.000 pound
to the one who killed the Beast.
Thousands of peasants and soldiers
joined the hunters.
During a few houres we forgot
we were hunting the Beast.
Everyone got a map and a place
to assemble.  We start at 7.
Go ahead. My people have
other things to do.
Your generousity matches
your courage and...
Enough. I hope for your sake
that we catch it this time.
That's a certainty, Sir Duke.
What kind of racket is that?
A beautiful weapon, not?
I had it made by a weapons
blacksmith in Mende.
You understand that i wanted
it custom made.
Look...
...even in Paris you can't find
such bullets. I mould them myself.
Silver? You fear werewolves?
No, but i want to
leave a signature.
I'm a hunter.
Its a passion that has cost me a lot.
What happened to you?
I've learned that some predators
need more then a bullet.
There's more to curing gangreen
then a prayor.
Has a bear wounded you?
-A lion.
made me travel alot.
You dont know Africa, Fronsac.
Gentlemen... my daughter is to blame.
I'll bring her here.
Punish her accordingly.
A witch.
The daughter of the devil.
Look at her, a demon.
She's sick, she's not possessed.
She's not possessed.
The Evil. The sign of the devil.
Bewitched.
Make sure she doesnt swallow here tongue.
She will suffocate.
She's not possessed.
She's not possessed
-I know
Taxidermist, philosopher... And
even a healer.
Congratulations.
She didn't come.
Marquis.
And the people?
Supersticuous. Nothing different
than this place.
The Indians eat the heart of
their prey, for its strength.
Is that why they are savages?
In Africa they eat the
heart of their enemies.
Sir Duke, Jean-Francois,
move your people eastwards.
There you are.
-Your mother will be worried.
If i had listened to her,
i wouldn't be in the convent.
I know you dont believe me,
you're a freethinker.
Not when one is in love.
-Are you in love?
Ridiculous. We hardly know eachother.
You think that its about you?
Marianne.
She has to learn to ride like a woman.
Practice never hurt anyone.
My father never sees any evil.
-My son sees evil in everything.
People died here.
How do you know that?
I hear their screams.
-Mani, stop that.
He's right.
There was an army camp here.
When it was torched,
Is he psychic?
That's not needed.
To observe is sufficient.
When i was little,
i came to play here with my brother.
Weren't you afraid?
He would protect me against
the ghosts.
Don't you like the hunt?
-Is that a crime around here?
According to indian custom, you
steal someone's soul if you draw them.
Does my soul interest you?
Why on foot?
Do you want to get mutilated?
It's my fault.
-I ask nothing of you.
What was that?
-Only a wolf.
And what if it was the Beast?
-I dont think it was, Marianne.
Thanks.
I hope the Beast is one
of the wolves.
They wont be eating anyone.
What a special person.
Where did you find him?
-In Canada.
It's... How does one say it.
An Acad?
An Indian. An Irok,
from the tribe of the Mohawks.
An Indian? A real one?
He doesnt look like an Indian.
Makre sure that you're
in Saint-Alban tonight.
We'll entertain ourselves with
your servant.
He's not my servant.
What is he then, cursed?
-My brother.
How can you mix your
blood with that of a savage?
He who shares my discomfort,
is no savage.
Because of Mani i was able
to escape from the English.
I thought those animals
were cannibals.
As you can see, Sir Intendant,
Mani is no animal.
Would you be able to procriate
with a woman of our race?
All women are equal once
the candles are extinguished.
Yes, they're clear of mind.
The Indians slept with white men
and had children. We are equals.
That's said hasty.
It's a bit like with black men...
What do you think of it, Sardis?
Your bloodbrother must be a child of God.
You had him baptised?
-He didnt ask me.
Good. You follow times closely.
-Mani has his own believe.
He was somesort of priest in
his tribe.
Do Indians have priests?
They are lost.
What is their believe?
Every human has a conginial
with the animals. A totem
Nice, but i don't understand.
Would you mind?
Don't be afraid. It won't hurt.
U...
Kariboe... thats somekind of
deer.
Yes, a deer. What do you think?
Am I a deer by the horns or
by somebody else?
And my dear Thomas? What is his..
...totem?
-Worm.
A book-worm.
A snake?
-Snake?
With the Indians,
Snakes stand for wisdom
Wise snake.
And you, mylord Intendant?
A pig.
Away with those wrinkles.
With those barbarians the pigs
may represent nobility.
Who is next? Sardis?
-No. No
And me?
What am I? Half a lion, half
an eagle?
Change me in a lizard, so
my arm will grow back on.
Jean-Francois. Enough.
What's wrong? Am I going
too far?
Let me, let me.
Mrs., would you?
Excuse me, but your
tricks bore me.
I choose to withdraw, before you
start dancing on a ball.
Good evening.
That will relax you.
It's not Paris, but it's the best
Mende offers.
And it sleeps better than in
an inn.
They are all for you, gentlemen.
And we have a new...
My dear Marquis, come.
I'm expensive, Gregoire de Fronsac.
Do we know eachother?
-From here Gevaudan looks small.
ltalian?
A passage in this beautiful country.
I got some money.
Thats not the only issue.
And?
Who did that?
An Irokese arrow.
Your heart was not far away..
Maybe I am..
a man with luck.
And that?
A bear.
And he didn't love me.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I have a dangerous job.
Not all men have manners like you.
That's a recollection on me.
That is a scandal in my house.
Valentine. What is this?
-I don't sleep with wizards.
What does it mean?
-He got snakes on his body.
Our reputation is at risk.
It's nothing, it is an Indian.
Not a wizard.
I don't want Indians.
-You hookers are difficult.
And, girls?
Who's going with the Redskin?
I double the price.
I like his sketches...
-Well, everything is gonna be alright...
Are you a wizard?
Are you going to sketch me?
If your not honest.
Several weeks passed...
...and the soldiers
could't find the Beast.
It was the 3th winter
under his lordship...
...and we knew
the snow and the cold...
...just like our weapons,
would not make it stop.
Think about the threatens God
announced through Mozes' mouth..
"I will come to you like a bear
lost her welps"
I shall tear your children
like a lion..
and send the Beast that will
consume you..
and your cattles,
and will make...
deserts of your roads."
How long will you stay angry, Lord?
One candle per victim.
Do you really think we live
in a rational time?
Mercy.
I ask forgiveness.
Mercy.
Bless me.
What is it, my son?
God punished me.
My children are gone.
I'm doomed.
We're all doommed.
Gather your men,
we leave at once.
Warn Mani, i see you on the way.
Goodeavening, friend of the wolves.
I'v got something for you.
I would like to speak with you, Marianne.
Alone.
In 10 days my mother and father
will both go away.
I am not as free as you are.
Bring me the torch.
Bring the torch.
The storm starts and they are tired.
We'd better go home.
No. Let's find the girl.
I found the child.
Captain, those traps you set catch
more farmers than wolves.
Your men are leaded by misuse
of power.
And since your chase the wolf has
killed 12 times.
I don't understand.
It shouldn't have escaped.
What?
-It shouldn't have escaped.
And you, Knight, do you
know what kind of wolf it is?
Gentlemen...
The only certainty I have,
is that it's not a wolf.
A wolf does not attack people.
I observed them in Canada.
Maybe there the wolves are different.
A wild wolf would attack anybody.
If it gets frantic,
it will die in 2 weeks.
And still it's running around here
for 2 years now.
By the way, I saw wounds a wolf
could never have made.
And I found, in a body of a victim,
a piece of iron.
And?
-And?
No animal has iron teeth.
Is the Beast not an animal then?
Well, how do we catch it?
As we are talking, it kills people.
I think we should listen carefully
to Fronsac.
So, Knight, you think
The Beast is not an ordinary animal.
I'm glad you admit its something
extraordinary.
I don't admit anything Sir.
I only have my doubts.
Knight, do you have something
left to say?
No gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I received this from Paris.
Captain Duhamel, His Majesty
was informed about your mistakes..
... and I was asked to get
you off this case.
You and your men leave at once
to your regiment in Langogne.
Sir Beauterne is already on his
way to Langogne.
His Majesty gave orders to kill
the wolf.
...and he is the only one who is
allowed to hunt in the district.
Gentlemen.
Have you forgiven me?
I would like to know my totem?
Do i say that properly?
I would say...
...a mermaid.
You are never serious.
I will ask your Redskinned man.
And the Beast? Did you see it?
No.
-Don't you want to talk about it?
I could only make some absurd
suppositions.
When I say the Beast is made
of flesh and iron...
... that it can think and dissapear
when it wants to.
What would you think?
-That our air would make you talk nonsense.
People would think that it hides
for me.
You haven't been long here and
you already want to be finished.
Did you think the Beast would
surrender that easily?
Maybe it's scared of you.
-Am I so scary then?
You enjoy a lot more from a
difficult victory.
Jean-Francois said you wanted to
go to Africa.
It's a dream of a taxidermist
who is fed up with the winter.
And you? Don't you want to
discover other regions?
The women have more duties then
desires.
Do you see Sardis on the walls?
Does he keep an eye on you?
-No
It watches me.
Alone with you in the park.
Who knows what will happen.
Come, the priest will catch a
cold.
Goodnight, Knight.
Goodnight, Knight.
You're in love.
-I don't know.
I know.
The maps?
I didn't need them for you.
Let us drink.
To Mrs. Morangias.
Why?
Her brother was there too that night.
Did you sleep with him?
With him?
He is not to be touched.
He looks, he drinks...
...and when he's drunk, he talks
in his sleep. Like all men.
Do I talk in my sleep?
What do I say then?
Do you know how Florentine women keep
their men at home?
They give their husbands slowly working
poison each morning.
...and each night an antidote.
Men who sleep elsewhere will have
a bad night because of that.
A women like you doesn't need that.
And by the way, we're not married.
Make room for Antoine de Beauterne..
...carrier of His Majesty, who will
release the region..
...of the Beast.
Mylord, I am Gregoire de Fronsac.
-Oh I remember. The servant of Buffon.
The taxidermist and balmer.
He sleeps with the intendant.
We have an appointment at 2 exactly.
His Majesty asked me your opinion
about your report.
Complicated fables...
I think the Beast is a wolf.
Tomorrow I will leave to investigate.
I don't want you to join me.
Why not?
The King wants me to do it..
...and me alone..
I don't need you to complete this.
You'll find a letter signed by
Buffon on the table..
...and our beloved King.
I am inferior to him.
But believe me, it's not...
I read your report. Don't waste
energy for the Beast anymore.
I will take care of it.
You can go.
Come, come, come.
Come.
A women from Lorciere.
She came back from a party.
We lost it south of the Mouchet.
It just dissapeared.
Knight, the Beast attacked a women
in Saint-Alban.
God punished me,
my children are gone.
No more than you I believe in
monsters.
His snout was longer and
the teeth are like knifes.
The only certainty is that it's
not a wolf.
It's not an animal?
-A frantic wolf attacks everyone.
How do we catch it?
No animal has iron teeth.
Knight, you have to come at once.
I saw it.
He poored poison and said
satanic words.
God knows how long this has been
going on.
Let him be.
It's an Indian remedy.
Only our prairs can save her
But.... She was not...
A miracle.
Tell me.
What happend to your brother?
A man with the Beast.
-She doesn't know what she is saying.
Yes, mylord. The Beast is dead.
Ten bullets.
It didn't survive.
We brought the necessary.
Start at once.
That's not the beast.
-Start. Mr. Beauterne is coming.
Rediculous. This is not the Beast.
-Like I said, Mr. Beauterne is coming.
I dont like the way you work.
-Bye, Knight. Leave us.
And, Fronsac? Don't you like my
Beast?
What's the meaning of this?
You know this is not the Beast.
His jaws are twice as big as these.
-You got everything to fix that.
I must bring the Beast to Paris,
and I got this wolf.
You should make a Beast for me.
Do you want the King to believe..
-No, Fronsac.
I carry out his will.
You should too. That would be wise.
-Are you threatening me, mylord?
On my age?
You know who I am.
...and you're too intelligent
to have yourself threatend.
If you do your job, the king
will be grateful.
If you don't do your job he
will be very dissapointed.
Do you have everything you need?
I'm counting on you. See you soon.
