At this moment,
rather him than me.
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.
Colonel Bouvar passed away
in his sleep, so they tell me.
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.
Is there anything else our
French station can do for Monsiuer Bond?
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.
I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.
No well-dressed man
should be without one.
- They're coming to get me.
- Hurry!
The International Brotherhood for
the Assistance of Stateless Persons...
We have been able to arrange for
visas at the Brazilian Consulate.
The Brotherhood
will look after you until...
- Good morning, Mr. Largo.
- Good morning.
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.
- We pay back everything!
- There will be no need.
We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss...
I regret to inform you all
of the death of Spectre Number Six.
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin.
We will now proceed with the area
financial reports. Number Seven.
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.
- All the man had.
- Number Ten.
Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter specialist...
Three million francs
from the special department...
- of the Quai D'Orsay.
- Number Five.
Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery: 250,000 pounds.
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States...
2,300,000 dollars, collected by
Number Nine and myself.
Our expectations were considerably
higher, Number 11.
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.
have been accounted for
by yourself and Number Nine?
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary...
I have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly...
whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members.
I have decided
on the appropriate action.
We will hear from Number Two,
who's in charge of our NATO project...
the most ambitious Spectre
has ever undertaken.
Our intention
is to demand a ransom...
from the
North Atlantic Treaty Powers...
I have sent Spectre agent Count Lippe
to the south of England...
where he is making
the necessary preparations.
conveniently located
near the NATO air base.
- Oh, Pat?
- Hello.
- I'll see you when I've had a shower.
- I'll soon be finished.
- Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.
- You're not taking her away already?
She's the only joy
in this dreary place.
- About half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.
A red square
with a spike through it.
I think it's a Tong sign,
the red dragon from Macao.
- Ask records to verify it for me.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.
- File it till you get back.
- Moneypenny...
next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.
On yogurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy. Take off your bathrobe.
You never say that
as if you meant it.
I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.
A motorized traction table
for stretching the spine.
Stop fooling around
and face down, please.
By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?
I really don't know
too much about him.
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.
There, now, the first time
I've felt really safe all day.
I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 15 minutes.
I can't think how
it could have happened.
I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.
- Yes.
- Might even shrink you back to size.
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.
Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.
- I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.
- What's that?
- Mr. Angelo.
- I'm sorry.
You don't think you could be
more comfortable if you take off this...
- Yes?
- Major Derval?
- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.
Besides, it will give you
time to cool off.
- Do you wanna bet?
- You know your Francois.
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir.
- Nobody saw us. The corridor's empty.
- Shut the door!
He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.
- Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything as arranged.
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...
Not enough.
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.
Make it a quarter of a million,
or get someone else.
- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.
All right, but against
a quarter of a million.
- Agreed.
- His watch.
- Au revoir!
- No, he always says ciao.
The rest of my money,
just have it ready.
This is a normal training sortie,
and you'll be accompanied...
by a NATO representative,
Commandant Derval...
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan...
armed with two atomic bombs,
M.O.S. Type.
Fuses as usual
in the white security box.
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.
Nowhere. I thought
I'd take a little exercise.
Can I help you?
County Police here.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- It most certainly could not.
- Hello.
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?
would you care to change places
with the copilot?
- Better view up here.
- I'd be delighted.
You are now under
positive radar control.
Take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?
O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic flashed us.
They lost it on radar. We haven't
been able to pick it up anywhere.
Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?
Rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.
- She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?
Not according to the last report,
which came from about here.
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.
Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.
Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.
- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.
Switch on
the underwater landing lights.
- Stand by to winch in the submarine.
- Man the winches!
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.
Get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers.
Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?
Some new safety device.
A secret control.
What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe...
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.
You will write,
or telephone at the least.
Day by day. I'm truly sorry
I have to dash off like this.
There's been a bit
of a flap at the office.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I travel...
- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.
- You are late!
- Yes.
Some people on the road
really burn you up these days.
In the conference room.
Something pretty big.
Every Double-0 man in Europe has been
rushed in, and the Home Secretary too.
The Prime Minister
has asked the Home Secretary...
Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear...
was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.
Unless within the next seven days
your government...
pays to us
we shall destroy
a major city in England...
Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging...
have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed...
that unless the bombs are recovered,
payment will have to be made.
complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements.
The Prime Minister has asked
that your department...
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.
Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash...
or landing, and worldwide reports
have proved negative...
on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.
I'll leave you to carry on.
We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
You may now open the folders
in front of you.
As you can see,
we've very little to go on.
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.
until you discuss your
individual assignments with me.
I've assigned you
to station C, Canada.
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force liaison.
Sir, I respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to Nassau.
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports?
- Well?
- There was a photograph of that man...
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.
Oh, no, sir. Not possible.
He was seen...
boarding the Vulcan
and took off last night.
If 007 says he saw Derval
last night and he was dead...
that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister.
- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.
Smashing figure.
I don't suppose...
that has anything to do
with your request?
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...
And I'll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man.
Couldn't miss.
She has two moles on the left thigh.
- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.
- I've been admiring your form.
- Have you?
Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form.
- You swim like a man.
- So do you.
- Do you come here often?
- Whenever I'm bored.
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.
- For effort.
- Thank you.
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.
- Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.
Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.
I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.
- Keep trying.
- It won't start!
You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbor, would you?
I have a very important appointment.
I'd appreciate a lift.
You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?
- Perhaps lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?
All right. Change of tack.
Have some of my conch chowder.
You've been reading
the wrong books, Mr. Bond.
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.
It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.
- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.
- I don't blame him.
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?
- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come with you?
- I'd love to meet your guardian.
- Oh, no.
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.
- Perhaps we can have dinner together.
- No.
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?
Bye then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.
- 500 pounds, please.
- Certainly, monsieur.
- There.
- Thank you.
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.
The spectre of defeat.
Your luck was due to change.
Any objection to raise the limit?
- Too big for me.
- Count me out too.
Perhaps you would like
to take the shoe.
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.
- One of my associates spoke about you.
- Nothing bad, I hope.
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.
You may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.
- No.
- Seven.
For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.
Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.
Soon, my dear.
I want to get my money back first.
May I be allowed
to buy the lady a drink?
- I would appreciate that.
- Then I must pass the shoe.
He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.
Sounds better than... What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?
In Capri. I was there
with my brother, Francois.
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.
Must we talk about him?
I'd much rather dance.
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.
He's a Commandant
with the NATO forces there.
The trouble is
I never meet anyone like him.
- Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We're going the day after tomorrow.
As I said,
we haven't got much time.
Well, when one has so little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr. Bond.
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.
Come to lunch on Sunday.
The Palmyra. It's my house.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You must tell me what Mr. Bond
had to say, word for word.
What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.
He asked were we
sleeping aboard tonight.
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.
That's a fine way
to treat the C.I.A.
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were about to say 007.
You know me better than that.
Here you go, Smiler.
Have you seen everything
you came to see?
Tell them, the little fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.
- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish...
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.
- Quist to see Mr. Largo.
- Open up.
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.
Hey, there,
did you finally make contact?
You're late. Felix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do?
- This way, gentlemen.
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.
He has no plans
to visit the United States.
from the Overseas Service
of the B.B.C.
Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.
This was caused
by a mechanical failure...
which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.
And here once again
are the headlines.
- Oh, no!
- Ah, 007.
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me too.
I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field...
on the run, as it were...
highly irregular.
The sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count.
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.
Now, here's something I want you
to use with special care.
- With special care.
- Everything you give me...
Is treated with equal contempt.
Yes, I know.
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures...
in rapid succession
by pressing that button there.
- Is that clever?
- If you can take pictures...
Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.
which fires a bright red flare,
a distress signal.
You should keep it on you
day and night.
Now, in the event of a re-breather
not being available...
you can use this device
for short periods only, of course.
- Clever.
- You'll only use it as a last resort.
It closes
to a convenient pocket size.
Now pay attention.
A recently developed...
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you...
Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.
A container will be dropped
off the coast of Burma...
latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east...
at 20 hundred hours
Greenwich mean time on May 27.
It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds between...
Total value to be not less than
After we have
recovered the container...
you will be notified on
radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.
Kenniston, you'd better get on
to De Beers at once.
Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found...
I'm very much afraid
we'll have to pay their price.
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.
One or two things
that might interest us.
The Disco Volante is still in the
harbor, lying off the casino channel.
The catamaran is there too,
so we can use it for cover.
That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.
- Any further news from London?
- No.
Zero hour is still
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?
- Okay, this will do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.
Look! Must have hit him
with the propeller.
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.
Thank you.
You just about saved my life.
My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?
No, it's just that
I have no desire...
At least you won't
have to swim ashore.
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Me too. This is my hotel.
- What a coincidence.
- Yes, so convenient.
You look pale.
I hope I didn't frighten you.
You see, I've always
been a nervous passenger.
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.
Yeah. So that's how
they could leave and get back.
Yes, and nobody saw them.
Obviously the whole operation...
That's where we'll have to look
for the plane. Come on.
I'll bring the prints
to the hotel when they're dry.
Don't forget the Air Force searched
the area 250 miles out of Nassau.
That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.
Sure she was, but harbor control
said for only six hours.
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.
About 90 miles is her limit for
six hours, and that's out and back.
I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.
All right.
Let's get back to Nassau.
- We haven't got much time.
- You're right, we haven't.
- You would like Bond dead?
- I can think of no better arrangement.
Because he tries to make love
to your woman?
Because he is Bond, and as an enemy
of Spectre, he should be killed.
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness...
his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here.
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.
- Mr. Largo?
- Yes, sir.
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr. Bond.
- Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.
I just hope I'm not
interrupting anything.
- What do you mean?
- I thought you had another visitor.
That gun, it looks
more fitting for a woman.
Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.
- Which is which?
- I thought you might have met...
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drink, sir?
- Rum Collins?
- Yes.
Vargas does not drink,
does not smoke...
What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you would call one for me?
- Of course. Pull!
- It seems terribly difficult.
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?
- Yes, I would very much.
- Lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.
Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.
As I'll be busy this evening,
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...
to take you to the Jankanoo,
our local Mardi Gras.
- That's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.
Our Mr. Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.
- Let me go!
- Over here.
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.
Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?
- James, Paula's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?
- Do you think she was onto something?
- I don't know, but I gotta find out.
- You watch out for her.
- Right.
The governor's not very happy,
but you'll have...
a power cut as requested
all over the island.
I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.
- I want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.
- Is it a power failure?
- Yes, all over the island.
Switch over
to the emergency generator.
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think, cyanide?
Search that way!
And you, the shark pool!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
You fools! He's got
you all shooting at each other!
Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat.
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.
Since you're here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?
I had the feeling
you've been avoiding me.
I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbors.
They just moved me down
this afternoon.
It's extraordinary, isn't it?
Almost as if...
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?
Look, you know
we're going to be too late.
- Too late for what?
- The Jankanoo.
I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.
Enough to drive you wild.
Do you like wild things?
Wild. You should be
locked up in a cage.
You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.
I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.
Not that it matters, but that
was under the pillow all the time.
You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Then it has its dangers.
- It's something you know so much about.
- My dear girl.
Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for King and Country.
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?
But of course.
I forgot your ego.
James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman...
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.
She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.
Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we've been held up by the Jankanoo.
- Like to have a drink, man?
- Get him away!
- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!
- It's real firewater.
- Get out of here!
- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Love to what?
- You're mad. Do you know that?
- Yes. Isn't everyone?
You should have told me
your wife was here.
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.
Do you mind if my friend
sits this one out? She's just dead.
You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.
You will then proceed
to the Megui Archipelago...
20 degrees north,
The diamonds will be
in a special container.
Paying the blood money,
letting them beat us.
- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.
Your man, 007,
I thought he was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?
- I'm afraid so.
- He obviously has...
a highly developed sense of,
shall we say, drama?
If 007 thought
he was on to something...
It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.
Well, we have exactly
Then I suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can. Shan't we?
Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.
- Golden Grotto?
- Yeah. All you'll find...
- At what?
- Never mind! Take her down, quick!
Set her down.
I think we've found it.
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.
Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.
I don't know how long the others
will take before they finish him off...
- but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- She's down there, all right.
- Are the bombs on board?
- No.
- Great. What's our next move?
If the bombs aren't aboard her now,
they soon will be.
Ow! Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous!
It's the first time I've
tasted women. They're rather good.
You're the only man
to ever make me cry.
Except perhaps Francois,
my brother, when we were children.
I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of love.
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away?
It's a long story,
and it involves your friend Largo.
Look, I can't explain
what this is all about.
- But you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?
Largo had your brother murdered,
or it was on his orders.
Hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon...
That much we do know,
but there's something we don't...
The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?
- Yes.
- Good.
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.
If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.
As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.
Very soon now. He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.
You better go straight back. I'll take
care of Vargas and everything here.
Understand I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.
But promise you will kill Largo
for me, whatever happens.
- We haven't much time.
- All right.
Oh, something I remembered.
It may not be important.
- Tell me. Everything's important.
- There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers
to go near it.
- Where do they lead to?
- Down into the sea...
Did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the Disco?
- If she is on board, where is 007 now?
- That's the question.
- Prepare to get underway.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- It's stuffy in there.
- I want a breath of air.
- My dear, did you not hear me?
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.
- Let me see.
- No. Why should I?
Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,
I imagine, and Vargas is dead.
No, my dear.
There is no escape for you.
Like your friend,
you've been a little too clever.
You have given me
much pleasure, Domino.
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows...
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.
- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.
A private little matter between
the young woman and myself.
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.
It's a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed...
Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.
Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante...
- Weigh anchor!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.
He's gone mad!
Please talk to them for me.
Tell them that I only did what
I had to do, what I was told to do.
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.
I threw the arming device
into the sea.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad?
- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he helped me.
- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!
He's jammed the controls!
Come on!
- Come on, now, jump!
- I never learned to swim!
