Next!
Name?
Gus Gorman.
Ah, yes.
August Gorman.
Have you looked
For work this week?
Uh...yes.
What kind?
Uh...
Kitchen technician.
Dishwasher?
Any luck?
A little, but...
Mr. Gorman, you've been
Unemployed for 36 weeks.
No, it's 35.
Not counting this week.
You secured employment
Last June
As a messenger
And were discharged
After one day
For losing--
No, no, they said
I lost it.
I did not lose it.
It was stolen
By a pickpocket.
A television set?
A teensy-weensy Japanese
The only other
Employment you found
Was in a fast food
Joint which lasted...
That's some record.
Talk about fast!
They expect you
To learn stuff in one day.
Hold the lettuce!
Hold the ketchup!
Can i have some sauce?
Cheese! No cheese!
The city of metropolis
Is generous to a fault.
I'm not the fault!
Chronic unemployment,
Living off the taxes of
Hard-working citizens.
Do you know
What you are?
I'm not a bum!
You are...
I was about to say,
No longer eligible.
No longer--
Next!
I need this week!
Next!
You mean that's it?
Finished? Like, over?
Huh!
Next!
Next.
Next as in "bye."
Next!
Name?
Excuse me, brother,
Can i have a light?
Say thank you.
Wow!
Way to go, superman!
Computer: your drink
Is on its way.
Uh, sir?
Excuse me, but...
What if you want to--
Enjoy your drink!
Program 2 bilateral
Coordinates at once?
You can't do that.
But if you--
Computer technology
Is very advanced,
But it can't do that.
But if we can't
Do it that way...
Sir?
Good lord!
How did
You do that?
I don't know.
I just did it.
Who's this?
That's him,
Ross Webster,
Just after he
Received the award
For humanitarian
Of the year.
Oh, he is
Good-looking!
I gave him
F-2 at 1/50TH.
One thing
I don't understand
Was the point of the story
Lois wrote
Is how this Ross Webster
Got this great honour.
And you bring me
One picture of him
And 15 pictures
Of this other person.
Who is she?
Lorelei ambrosia.
She's Webster’s--
She's just Webster’s.
Let's leave it at that.
Who's this
Other woman?
That's his sister Vera.
Picture looks fuzzy.
The picture's fine.
She looks like that.
She's vice president
Of webscoe industries.
I don't understand you.
A boring banquet,
And you bring me
Superman saves a man
From drowning
On 3RD avenue,
And you don't
Get one picture!
I didn't
Have my camera!
A photographer eats
With his camera,
Sleeps
With his camera.
I'm glad I’m a writer.
Time to draw
The jingo number.
The prize is
A south American trip!
I don't know why--
Morning,
Everybody.
Hi, Clark.
Jimmy, you've got
Mustard on your lapel.
Mr. White, i hate
To interrupt--
I'm getting
A paper out!
Stick to
The printing press.
What's the number?
"53."
Mr. White?
You've got to pull
Mr. White,
What do you think?
I don't know.
I think it would make
A terrific story.
What's a terrific story?
Kent's high school
Class reunion.
Say!
Could we have
The next number?
It's practically
An American institution.
Most of
My classmates
Are still
In high school.
"33."
I thought the story
Would be about--
How much small
Towns have changed.
Can i go back
To middle America
After having become
A metropolis sophisticate?
I was looking around
In my closet last night
And i even found...
My high school sweater.
Uh...Smallville.
So should i make
My travel plans?
What about mine?
All right, Kent.
The prodigal son
Is coming home.
Gee, thanks, Mr. White.
It's hard losing one
Of my best reporters.
Oh, that's ok.
But you deserve
The vacation, Lois.
Thank you.
Lois, are you
Going someplace?
Some people get
To go to Smallville.
Others of us
Have to go to...
Bermuda.
Golly.
Bye.
Have a good time.
Mr. White,
The next number, please.
Well, i guess
I'd better be going, too.
So...I’ll be going.
Bye.
Couldn't
A computer do this?
Hey, what is this?
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man.
I'm supposed
To get 225 a week.
How am i supposed
To live on 143.80?
State tax, federal tax,
Social security.
You'll get money
When you're 65.
When I’m 65?
I want mine now,
While i can enjoy it.
I want to get down!
It's more like
$143.80 and 1/2 cent.
There are always
Fractions left over
In big corporations,
But they
Round it down.
What am i supposed
To do with 1/2 a cent?
You mean everybody
Loses those fractions?
They don't
Exactly lose them.
You can't lose
What you never got.
So the company
Gets it?
Not really.
They can't be bothered.
Then what
Happens to them?
They're just floating
Around out there.
The computers
Know where.
How many sugars?
One and a half.
It's quitting time.
You coming?
I've got some stuff
To finish up, so...
Working
Overtime, huh?
What you doing,
Looking for a raise?
Yeah.
Looking for a raise.
That's it.
You bet.
But my uncle al
Won't eat her stuffing.
He says it should be cooked
Outside the turkey.
She cooks it on
The inside of the turkey.
Aunt Helen,
My father's half sister--
I told you that,
Right?
Yeah. Hey,
Look at that.
Wow!
Turn back or pull over
Here and wait.
For how long?
I don't know.
That fire's spreading
Like wild...fire.
It's just
A building burning.
That's a chemical plant.
You know what i mean,
It's like chemicals.
If that goes
Up in smoke,
We'll be in for
A hairy time around here.
Ok.
Distract these people
So they don't know
What I’m doing.
What are you doing?
The chief says a photographer
Always goes after a story.
That could
Be dangerous.
Danger goes with
The territory, Mr. Kent.
How can i help?
Get this man
A helmet.
Oh, it's you.
Forget the helmet.
How bad is it?
It's a nightmare.
Everything's explosive,
Inflammable, or worse.
Get me a number 3
Ladder truck in here!
My god,
They're trapped!
What's he going to do,
Fly them down one at a time?
Let's go!
Everybody down here!
Hurry up!
Go on down.
Take it easy.
All right,
Everybody down.
You've got to
Get out of here.
I cannot leave.
I've got to
Look after those.
That's concentrated
Beryltric acid.
If it heats
Over 180 degrees,
This fire will
Look like a picnic.
If it remains
Stable, no problem.
If it heats up,
It'll turn volatile.
If that happens,
You'll get a cloud
That'll eat
Through anything--
Steel, concrete, anything.
Who the hell's that?
Get off of there!
I'll just get
A couple more shots.
Oww!
Ahhh!
Have them bring
Their hoses here! Quickly!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Superman!
It's my leg.
Take it easy.
We'll go nice and easy.
All right?
Here we go.
Medics!
Over here, please!
That's it.
Here you go.
It's the left leg.
My camera.
Yeah.
It's a clean break
Across the fibula.
Ow! My camera.
It's all right, jimmy.
You'll be ok.
Get that fire out, or
You'll have an acid cloud!
Christ!
The pumphouse is gone!
The pumphouse!
We've lost
The water pressure!
We've got
To have water!
Lake Canoga’s
Where's this lake?
That way.
You told me we had
An adequate water supply.
That man's a miracle.
Carol, you got gorgeous!
?? Tell Tchaikovsky
The news ??
?? I've got a rockin'
Pneumonia ??
?? I need a shot
Of rhythm and blues ??
?? Whoo ??
?? I think I’ll
Call in all the writers ??
?? Written down
By the rhythm reviews ??
?? Roll over,
Beethoven ??
?? Rockin' in
Two by two ??
I'll never forget it.
Fourth quarter,
Score was tied.
We were back on
Our 25-yard line.
The coach calls for
Right flanker option.
?? Roll over, Beethoven ??
?? Rocking in
Two by two ??
You really
Have grown, Clark.
You look very well.
I can't complain.
I have these
Little spells,
But, really,
I can't complain.
?? Well, early
In the morning ??
?? I'm a-giving you
The warning ??
?? Don't you step on
My blue suede shoes ??
?? Hey, diddle-diddle,
I will play my fiddle ??
Excuse me.
There's someone
I'd like to see.
?? And tell Tchaikovsky
The news ??
Lana?
Lana Lang?
It's great
To see you.
You look
Wonderful.
You look...wow!
Here, let me.
Oh, no, no.
I can manage.
Uh...
Isn't this
Your first visit
Since your mom
Passed away?
Yeah--I’m sorry.
Um...
I heard that you
And Donald split up.
Did you eat yet?
No.
I beg your pardon.
Excuse me. Sorry.
That's not right.
You're right about
Donald and me,
But hold this
A second, ok?
Oh, sure.
Hi, Kent.
Oh, hi.
How you...doing?
I'm sorry.
I'm going nuts.
Thanks.
?? Well, early
In the morning ??
?? I'm a-giving you
The warning ??
Clark.
Yeah.
Hey, Lana.
Uh-oh. Um...
Hey, sweet.
Here i am.
Remember when
You were prom queen?
Everyone wanted
To dance with you.
There's only one guy
On your dance card now.
That's good old--
Brad Wilson.
Hi, brad.
Hi, Kent.
Long time no see.
You know, see. See?
Come on, Lana.
I can't.
Clark already asked me.
I did?
Oh, excuse me.
Lana, i haven't danced...
?? Roll over,
Beethoven ??
?? Roll over,
Beethoven ??
?? Stick to these
Rhythm and blues ??
?? Oh-oh-oh-oh ??
?? Wa-a-a ??
?? Oh-oh-oh-oh ??
?? Earth angel ??
?? Earth angel ??
?? Will you be mine? ??
?? My darling dear ??
?? Love you
All the time ??
?? I'm just a fool... ??
Ah, Gorman.
Another week,
Another check.
Don't you have
Another one for me?
I put in a voucher
For expenses.
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here you go.
Woooh!
A-hem.
Thanks for
Helping me out.
A lot of guys would like
To be where i am.
You'd be surprised
How many offers
I didn't get.
Even brad wouldn't
Stick around for this.
It isn't easy.
The streamers?
Just pull, and they...
Not the streamers.
Everything.
I don't know why,
I feel like
I can talk to you.
What?
I feel i can
Talk to you!
You can?
Yes.
You know
Something, Lana?
What?
I, uh...
I always wished
That you would.
Remember when you
Were queen of the prom?
The royal wedding,
The king abdicated.
Isn't that terrible?
Yeah, it sure is.
There must be
A gallon
Of potato salad
Left over.
You know what
The problem is?
Too much mayonnaise?
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would you think
That was the problem?
The problem is,
Why do i stay
In Smallville?
Do you know
How lucky you are
To live in metropolis,
The big apricot?
Lana, you could--
How? And what
About Ricky?
Ricky?
My little boy.
You have...
That's great.
Here we have a house,
And I’ve got a job.
I'm only a secretary,
But it pays the bills.
Except for last winter
When the fuel bills
Kept going up and up.
I had to pawn
My diamond ring.
That's a shame.
You never got married?
Me?
Yeah.
Well, i was...
No. Not.
You know,
Years later,
You can look at
Someone and think,
"that's the one
That got away."
Give me that again.
Run it by me
Just one more time.
$85,000.
Missing?
Embezzled,
Mr. Webster.
Stolen
From the firm.
By whom? That's
What i want to know.
Vera, get a hold
Of yourself!
Nobody else
Ever will.
I don't know, who?
In the old days,
It was simple.
We kept books,
We had ledgers,
We knew what
Was paid out.
A robber carried
A gun and said,
"stick 'em up."
Now these blasted computers
Do their dirty work.
My old friend,
You are yesterday.
Whoever pulled this
Caper is tomorrow.
Honey bunch?
Mr. Webster, it's time
For your massage.
Does she have the right
To burst in--
No, no, Vera, Vera!
Simpson, you know
My psychic
Nutritionist?
Hello.
We're trying to hold
A meeting here!
Hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.
Ha! Improvement.
I'm about to
Take a human life!
Simpson, would you
Excuse us, please?
Tell her i won't
To stop-- let her--
Mouths closed.
Ears open.
She's a pig!
I can't have
Anyone with me
Who isn't with me.
Now...
Simpson,
Well, old chum,
What now,
Kiss the 85 thou
Goodbye?
Keep paying
The thief his salary
Until he thinks up more ways
To shake the money tree?
He'll slip up
Sooner or later.
Why?
They say that
In the movies.
He won't slip up.
He'll keep
A low profile.
He won't do a thing
To call attention
To himself.
Unless, of course,
He is a complete
And utter moron.
We're first.
Um...Andrew.
I'll pick Chris.
Um...mark.
I'll take Jamie.
We're stuck
With Ricky?
You lost
The toss.
Come on, Ricky.
Come on, Ricky.
Good luck.
I can't stand this.
He'll be ok.
I was a late
Bloomer myself.
It's not just that
He's small for his age.
He's the only kid
In town without a father.
Look, he's stewed
To the gills
In the middle
Of the afternoon.
He only had
Chocolate milk.
I mean him.
Hey, sweet thing.
Kid getting
Hassled, huh?
Kent, you still here?
I seem to be.
The kid needs pointers
From the champ here.
I won the all-country
Bowling championship.
I didn't
Know that.
Actually, i can play
Any sport.
Brad, you'll just
Make it worse.
Clark, he'll
Make it worse.
Watch. He'll get
A spare.
Come on, Ricky.
Hey, kid, you're
Holding it all wrong.
I'll show you.
Uh, brad...
I think he'll
Be better off
Doing it his way.
You got a big
Mouth, Kent.
Ricky doesn't need
A bowling lesson
In front of
The other kids.
He needs a man
To show him.
He's doing fine
On his own.
Excuse me.
Here you go.
Give it
Your best shot.
Oh! Sorry.
Ah-choo!
Gesundheit.
Thank you.
Hey, Gus.
The boss wants
To see you.
He can see me
From here.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.
Not that boss.
The boss.
You mean the boss?
Yep.
Wants to see me?
Why would
He want to see me?
Why would the boss
Want to see me?
There's no reason.
Oh, i know!
My suggestion for
The volleyball uniforms.
That's it.
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss.
Bossy Ross the boss.
Be calm, be cool,
Be collected.
Ok, uh...
Mr. Web--Mr. Webster?
Mr. Webster?
Mr. Webster, i did not...
Mr. August Gorman?
Aah! Sir!
August Gorman here.
I know you're
A compassionate man.
I don't want
To go to jail
Because there's
Robbers and rapists--
Just one question.
You've been
A naughty guy,
Haven't you?
Come on, admit it.
You've been
A little bit naughty.
I was--
That's all right,
I understand.
I can--what do
Young folks say?
"dig where you're
Coming from, brother."
You want
To be rich, right?
Well, i...
I was born rich.
Never worn
The same socks twice.
What do you do
With your socks?
They're laundered
And sent to some
Charitable institution.
Maybe they're turned
Into dust rags
Or something like that.
Or maybe socks.
Yes. That never
Occurred to me.
Gus, you know
Something?
You're a genius.
A naughty genius,
But nobody's
Perfect.
Cheers!
Because of the thing
With the computers.
Because computers
Rule the world today,
And the fellow
That fools computers
Can rule the world.
I've been searching
For a long time
For somebody to make
These machines do
What they're not
Supposed to do.
Understand?
Yes!
Webscoe, the webscoe
Industrial complex,
Is a family-owned
Cartel.
Little
Magnesium here,
Little zinc there.
You follow me?
I follow you.
You know
What i want now?
No.
I want coffee.
Black?
Cream or sugar?
You don't
Understand.
Under different
Company names,
I control the price
Of coffee beans
In Venezuela, brazil,
Bolivia, Jamaica,
And the republic of Gabon.
But I’ve got a problem,
And i think
You can help me.
One country
Won't play ball.
That can bug a guy.
That could bug...
What country?
Colombia.
Colombia!
Colombia has 2
Important exports.
One is coffee.
I've tried
To reason with them.
But this one
Miserable country
Thinks
It can dictate
The economy
Of an open market.
Gus...
Gus, my friend,
We're going to teach
Them a lesson,
Aren't we?
Mr. Webster...
Destroy the Colombian
Coffee crop
Right down
To the last bean.
The last bean?
We are?
But you got so much.
You know--
A wise man said--
I think it was
Attila the Hun--
"it is not enough
That i succeed.
Everyone else
Must fail."
Seems fair.
Gus.
What?
You are going
To do this for me.
How?
The weather.
You didn't tell me
Your mother was here.
I'm his baby sister.
Gus, have you ever
Heard of Vulcan?
Hi, miss Vulcan.
Vulcan is
The weather satellite
That's monitoring
The weather.
If somebody were
To reprogram it,
It could do more.
It could make weather.
Storms and floods.
Blizzards,
Heat waves.
How do you do that?
Like everything
In the 20TH century,
You push buttons.
There you go.
It's the first time
I've won anything.
You won my hand.
This is
The first time
I won anything
Valuable.
Get one with
The sombreros.
Mr. White,
You be in this.
Do i have to?
Why do i?
You're lucky
I didn't fire you.
I get a chance
To get exclusive pictures
Of the biggest chemical
Factory fire in history,
And he comes home
With a broken leg
And 12 melted
Rolls of film.
It was hot.
Smile,
Mr. White.
South America.
What luck!
If you don't want
To be traced,
Punch in to some
Rinky-dink outfit
That has
A Mickey-mouse computer.
Someplace you can
Sneak into, right?
Someplace where
Nobody knows him
So they can't
Connect him with us.
Webscoe has
They're all linked
Into the central
Computer system.
How about
Someplace...small?
Smallville!
This is Smallville.
We'll have
A 5-minute stop.
Watch your step, please.
Thanks, Selma.
Have a good day.
Let me
Help you, Lana.
Oh, I’m sorry.
Thanks, Clark.
Sit down, buster.
Good boy.
Come on,
Buster.
Sit down!
All set? Great.
Wow.
That's it, ok?
Jesus Christ!
Don't they have
Picnics in metropolis?
Not like this,
Ricky.
We do this a lot.
You do?
Stay close
And be careful.
Ok, mom.
Come on, buster.
Let's find
A rabbit.
This is nice
For him.
It's even nicer
When there's
A man around.
There's a lot
Of choices.
All the good
Ones are married.
That's why
Brad thinks
He's god's
Gift to women.
He won't take no
For an answer.
I meant there's a lot
Of choices here.
This is some picnic.
There's some of that...
And...mmm!
Green stuff.
And...hey, pat?.
Boy, this pat?
Is really unusual.
I didn't make pa--
Oh, Clark.
That's buster's
Dog food.
It's good.
Don't eat it!
This is nice.
Here.
It's all right, Lana.
Thanks.
Hey!
Where you going?
Come on! Buster!
How long--
I was thinking--
Sorry. Go ahead.
You.
Well...
I was thinking
Somebody like you
Could do well
In metropolis.
I have to face it.
I'm not going to
Find what i want
In Smallville
Anymore.
Could i make it
In metropolis?
What would i do?
Call me.
I wouldn't want to.
Wouldn't want
To call me?
I wouldn't want
To be a nuisance.
You couldn't
Be a nuisance, Lana.
Clark, may i
Tell you something?
My oil pan
Is leaking.
See? There's
Something dripping.
You need a hand?
No, thanks.
I studied up
On auto repair.
Look at this.
Oh, boy.
Lana, I’ll go see
If Ricky’s all right.
You ok?
Yeah.
Gosh!
Is he all right?
Hi.
Superman?
That's me.
Mom! Mom!
Ricky!
Have him checked
By a doctor.
Thank you.
I'm Lana lang.
This is Ricky.
This is Clark.
I have to be going.
So long, Ricky.
We were flying!
What were you doing?
Looking for buster.
Buster!
I found him!
Buster!
Mr. Kent?
Superman was here!
What?
He really was.
Aren't you excited?
I'm from metropolis.
I see superman
Every day.
You do?
Could you get me
His autograph?
If i had a nickel
For every time...
What do you want?
We're in big trouble.
What?
First of all,
They lost the invoice,
Then realized they were
Short on some items.
I rented a car because
I missed the plane.
Had a flat tire
On the highway.
Had to fix it myself
With these pinkies.
I figured your boss
Would be real peeved.
What are you
Talking about?
He'll hang our butts
Against the wall.
He wanted this order
Installed
No later than tomorrow.
I got to set up tonight.
Get what set up?
Pal, you're a real
Lifesaver.
I mean
A real lifesaver!
Where's the office?
Straight ahead.
Follow me.
Right behind you.
Oh, yeah.
Not bad.
Pretty good.
Do you know
What's wrong
With this
Singapore wing?
Sling.
Singapore sling.
What's wrong
With it?
There's not
Enough vodka.
There's no
Vodka in it!
What did
I tell you?
Put some vodka
In it.
What did you...
You know, hey...
There's vodka
In it now, buddy.
Yeah.
Yeah, perfect.
You never pass out,
Do you?
Nope.
Never.
Cowboy's down, buddy.
You thought
I was drunk, too,
Didn't you?
Ha ha! Fooled you.
Get the keys.
Yeowww!
Some...some...
Somebody's drunk.
I'm not drunk.
Hello, baby.
Hello, baby.
Ok.
All right.
Let's get down to it
And let's do it.
One, two,
Button your shoe.
Then put it in...
Both keys...
At the same time?
Ho ho!
Wait. Wait a minute.
You think you've won,
Don't you?
The Philly flash.
Vroom! Vroom!
Vroom! Vroom!
Ok...ready?
Yeah. Now...
We'll see
What we'll see.
Oh!
Oh...
Oh.
Come on.
Please let me in.
There it is!
Hello. Now!
Getting down to business.
I am a genius.
I am a...
Um...longitude.
And the other thing...
Latitude, right?
Oh, look, morey.
A native wedding.
Iarriba!
They never told us
This was the rainy season.
Newscaster:
Meteorologists are baffled
By the tornado
And torrential rainstorms
That struck Colombia
This afternoon,
Threatening to destroy
The nation's coffee crop
For the next 5 years.
Gale-force winds
Up to 250 miles an hour
Have lashed
The countryside,
While 12 inches
Of rainfall
Have been recorded
In one day.
A spokesman from Caltech
Said this was the most
Awesome display of--
Turn it off!
If i laugh harder,
I'll split my sides.
...seems to defy
All laws of weather systems
Known to science.
Poor little Colombia.
Well.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ooh! I'll get you
For that,
You big silly!
Bubba, do you realize
What we're on to?
Do i? Every time
A drunk sobers up,
He'll drink
Webster coffee.
Why stop at coffee?
Coffee gets
The world off to work.
But what keeps
The world working?
Diet soda?
Vera, you mean...
You mean--
Today, coffee...
Tomorrow, the oil!
Oil?
If Gus Gorman can push
The right buttons--
I can have it all.
All the oil,
All the pumps,
All the tankers.
This is some
Nifty idea, Vera.
Boss!
Just the man
I want to see.
It is not my fault.
What's
Not your fault?
Superman started
Doing his thing
When you started
Doing yours.
What are you
Talking about?
What am i--
It was on
Television, man.
Don't call me man.
I saw Colombia
Bite the dust.
You didn't see the man
Flying out of the sky
With his cape
Flapping in the...
His cape was
Flapping in the wind.
He was flying!
He was great! Wooshhh!
His cape blew
In the wind like this,
And he landed
In the middle
Of this big plantation.
He checked everything out
With his x-ray vision.
Then he put laser beams
Out of his eyes
Onto everything.
Bzzzz!
And guess what?
Dried up everything,
Just like that!
Dried it up
Like machines
In men's rooms,
You know, where
The hot air comes out?
Sometimes
They don't work.
But superman's worked.
And you think he took bows?
No, sir.
He flies off again!
He saw what
Caused the trouble
And flew
Into the tornado,
Went down to the bottom
Of the tornado,
And turned it
Upside down!
I thought
I'd go crazy!
I've never seen
Anything like it!
The big end was
On the bottom.
The little end
Was on the top.
Mr. Ross, it was...
Superman's bad.
I'll say he was.
I mean, he was bad!
No.
No!
No!
Let me help.
It was a perfect plan,
Foolproof!
We were the fools.
It's not my fault.
I did what i was
Supposed to do.
He ruined it.
The lousy do-gooder
Ruined it.
Now he'll stick his nose
Into my oil scheme
And ruin that, too.
I've got to
Get rid of him.
But how,
Shoot him?
Kryptonite.
What?
Or kryptonham...
Or kryptonheimer?
There's stuff that
Can hurt superman.
How would you know?
I know some things.
So i understand from
The graffiti I’ve seen.
She's right.
Kryptonite! I remember
Reading about it.
Where does
It come from?
The same planet
Superman came from--
Krypton.
Where is krypton?
It blew up in space
Many years ago.
They sent superman here
When he was a baby.
