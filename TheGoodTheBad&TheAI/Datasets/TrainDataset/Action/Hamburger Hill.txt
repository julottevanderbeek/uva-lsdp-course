Fort Worth's a hell of a town, l hear.
Troop!
Come on, girl-san,

Ηey, why don't you ask her

Look at him, man.
Who does he think he's kidding over there?
Ηey, Languilli, you'd better get your ass

or her father's gonna come out
and cut your dick off!
OΚ, girl.
Wait, wait, wait.
Who are you kidding, man?
You wouldn't know what to do with her

Unbelievable!
You souvenir me this,
l tell you, you're number one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ηey, troop!
Your dick will fall off
if you get any closer to that pussy.
They'll keep you in the Philippines
with the black VD. You'll never get home.
Get your ass back on the truck.
Sergeant Frantz.
l thought you bought a water buffalo
and a rice paddy to shit in.
- Where the hell you been, young stuff?
- Surfing.
Ηaul it out!
l met a nurse.
- Yeah?
- Round-eye.
You didn't.
She had her own trailer on the beach.
Oh, no.
l figured, "What can they do to me -
send me to Vietnam?"
l moved in with her.
A round-eye?
There it is.
Mamas and Papas found me on the beach.
Surfing?
Sit down, Bienstock.
What the hell
are you wearing that shit for?
lt's just gonna dehydrate your ass
and not do you any good.
But, Sarge, they told us
at Division training we had to wear...
Yeah.
We had a...
We had a short-timer once,
Johnny - I forget his name.
Ηe wore a flak jacket, two helmets,

This is Red 6 Alpha. Over.

Which way is it?
Jeez!
God damn, look at this!
l'm gonna put the new guys in your squad.
Oh, shit.
Ηey, don't "Oh, shit" me, Troop.
Old man has me breaking in another
new lieutenant, looks like Palmolive soap.
- I don't need this F-N-G shit.
- Well, write your congressman.
You can tell him l need a steak,
bucket of cold beer,
and a round-eye
to wrap my leg around.
Lieutenant Εden.
Sergeant.
Ηow are you?
Watch your back.
Watch out, man.
This isn't a parking lot,
for Christ's sakes.
Come on, Gaigin.
Ηere you go.
That all you got?
What did they say the signal
for incoming rounds was?
I can't tell the difference
between incoming and outgoing.
l dove off the shitter up at Εvans,
it was our stuff going out.
- l think it's two long sirens.
- Don't worry about it.
Ηey, man, l'm not worried about it.
l just think it's important
to know the signal for incoming rounds.
Don't worry.
Nobody's getting in here tonight.
- What's the signal for ground attack?
- Three shorts?
Green star cluster.
Τhat's great for night time.
What are we gonna do during the day?
Bird shit and paratroopers are the
only things that fall from the sky, Troop!
Sarge, are there any women here?
Ηey, l'm not screwing any whore.
Shit.
What, man, you'd eat her pussy.
Ηey, man, if you can't fry it, l don't eat it.
Yeah? A year is a long time, fellas.
That's Claire.
Oh, if she's fucking for peace, man,
l'm on the wrong side.
Watch it!
Back off!
Back off! Back off, man.

They number 1 0,000.

But they don't pay.
Me and Baby love grunts.
Well, we're two first-class mud rollers.

Oh, man, they got little dicks.
Same-same,

Wait, my fucking war?
My fucking war?
This ain't my fucking war,

Ηey! Come on now.
This is our fucking war, all right?
l no bullshit you.
Gl like to fight.
Vietnamese just want short time.
PX perfect change.
There it is.
Gl never leave.
No question.
As you were.
Now, as you were.
The question is,

do you have to boom-boom,
before those mean little bastards
from the North show up?
- Now that's the question.
- Yahoo!
Fucking 1st Platoon. l'm Lieutenant Εden.
Follow me, if you will, gentlemen.
Put your full name on line one,

All right, if you do not want anyone notified

Otherwise, fill in a name,
last name first, first name last
and address on line four.
Line five is for beneficiary.
All right, you have in your possession
forms for savings bonds, series Ε type.
Actually, l highly recommend
this program to you, men.
lt's a good plan for the future.
The white cards should be
filled out by married men.
This will ask for joint access to your funds
in case of an emergency.
You have postcards. Fill these out.
Let your family know you're safe,
how to get in touch with you.
All right, mail is a priority.
You don't need stamps.
You can write on a C-rat box,

Questions?
Gl number 1 !
lf you feel like giving me
-  A lifetime of devotion
- Ηey! Go! Go!

Ooh, lf you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
Ooh, l second that emotion
- Sarge.
- Ηey, man.
- Brother blood.
- Ηow's it going, Doc?
- Oh, by hand, brother.
- What's happening, man?
- Big time.
- Ηey, man.
Buzz around camp is
Doc just got back from R&R.
Are you gonna tell me
all the horny jacking-off details?
- Bangkok is not believable, man.
- Yeah, baby!
What happened
after l got med-evac'd?
Charlie had the shit together.
You hear me?
- Speedy?
- Who?
- The shit burner from 2nd Squad.
- Cranial contusion. l couldn't ventilate him.
- Brother Jones got blown to shit, man.
- Who's Jones?
The F-N-G, man.
Ηe knew everything the Temptations ever did.
Make sure we get some brothers in the squad.
l don't want to hear no more of that rebel
l lost my car on the motherfucking road
And l'm crying over you
Ηey, Sarge, Sarge.
Ηold up a minute.
l've got a flash for you.
This brother l was hanging out with
over at Delta Company.
Drives lron Raver.
Don't shit me, Sarge.
Rumour has it we're going
back into the Ashau.
Shit!
Come on, Sarge, man,
you know l'm too short for that shit.
Look, Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.
See if there's a job for me
over at headquarters.
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.
All the white motherfuckers
are back there.
Remove the protective wrapping
from the toothbrush.
Put the wrapping next to your left foot.
Open the toothpaste.
Put the cap on top of the wrapping.
Now put a generous amount of paste
on the sterile bristles.
People, you will brush your teeth
in a rapid vertical motion for one minute.
That's up and down for you
rebel motherfuckers.
Now, when l say "Stop," you turn to your right
and you brush. Ready?
Brush.
You may notice a granular taste.
Τhat's pumice.
Its purpose is to sear the teeth
and allow the fluoride to penetrate.
Gentlemen, in Vietnam,
you will be confronted
by many organisms
in the food, water, air
that are foreign
to American bodies.
Ringworm, impetigo, malaria,
amoebic dysentery,
and crotch rot.
lt has been found that proper dental hygiene
is an important component
in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.
What are you doing?
Come on. Lighten up, bro.
l'm not your brother.
Now, did l tell you to spit?
No, sir.
lf you want to walk out of this fucking place,
you will listen to people who know.
You be an individual,
and l'll be tagging
your ugly toothless face straight on its way
to a long box with metal handles.
Now brush your teeth
in a rapid vertical motion!
Troop.
Yeah.
Good morning, Vietnam.
Let's go!
Arise! Awake!
Salute another glorious morning,
you scroungy-assed sons of bitches.
l see you've found a home
in the army, Worcester.
- Ηey, same-same to you, young fella.
- Man, l'm no lifer.
and l'm finny Vietnam?
Finny fucking green machine?
l'll be a private fucking civilian with places to go.
- People to see.
- Τhings to do.
Well...let me talk to you.
..Sitting on the dock of the bay...
l want you to keep an eye on these new guys
in case we got to go back into Ashau.
Don't mean nothing.
l left my home in Georgia...
Don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette?
Headed for the Frisco Bay
l had...
- Did you sleep last night?
- I kept seeing things.
What do you mean,
you kept seeing things?
Did you sleep?
..on the dock of the bay...
Did you hear something?
watching the tide...
Oh, this is bullshit.
We got to sleep.
What are we gonna do,
stay up for a year?
All right, listen up.
You people will not die on me in combat.
You fucking new guys
will do everything to prove me wrong.
You'll walk on trails,
kick cans, sleep on guard,
smoke dope, and diddly-bop through the bush
like you were back on the block.
While on guard at night,
you'll write letters, play with your organ,
and think of your girl. Forget her.
Some hair-head has her
on her back right now
and is telling her to fuck for peace.
Τhis is Ηan.
Those of you who are foolish
will think of him as gook,
slope, slant, or dink.
Ηe is your enemy.
Ηe came over
on the Chieu Ηoi program,
and he'll go back out there
after he fattens up on C rations,
and he will be hunting your young asses
in the Ashau Valley.
Now, forget about this
Viet Cong shit.
What you'll encounter out there
is hard-core NVA, North Vietnamese -
motivated, highly-trained,
and well-equipped.
lf you meet Ηan or his cousins,
you will give him respect,
and refer to those little bastards
as Nathaniel Victor.
Meet him twice and survive,
you will call him
Mister Nathaniel Victor.
People, I am tired
of filling body bags
with your dumb fucking mistakes.
You think this funny?
Alphabet.
Languilli.
Ηan is closing in on your position.
lt's night. Look at me!
I'm gonna save your life,
and you're gonna save mine.
lt's night, it's raining.
While you're thinking about peace, love,
and whether or not we should be in Vietnam,
Ηan is gonna cut your fucking throat.
- And you're sleeping.
- No, Sergeant.
You've been humping
the boonies for months.
You're tired. lt's your turn to sleep.
What d'you think Ηan's gonna do?
ls he gonna wake up, Alphabet, and smile,
and talk about women?
Mister Nathaniel Victor
gets his rocks off watching you die.
Some of you think you have problems
cos you're against the war.
You demonstrated in school,
you wear peace symbols on your steel,
and you have attitudes.
l'm an orphan, my brother's queer,
the city of Chicago got the clap from my sister,
Mom drinks, Dad coughs blood,
l have ringworm, immersion foot,
the incurable crud,
and the draft ruined my chances
of being a brain surgeon.
People, you have no problem...
except me...
and him.
..Got himself into a jam
Way down yonder in Vietnam
Put down your books and pick up a gun
We're gonna have a whole lotta fun
It's one, two, three,
what are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, l don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's five, six, seven,
open up the Pearly Gates
Well, there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee, we're all gonna die
Now, come on WaII Street,
don't be slow
Why, man, this is war-a-go-go
There's plenty good money to be made
Supplying the army with the tools of the trade
Just hope and pray that
if they drop the bomb
They drop it on the Vietcong
And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, l don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam...
Ηey, pal.
Do you know where l can
find a General Rufferman?
Ηe's no friend of mine.
Ηe's a major general -
two stars.
Supposed to deliver this trailer to him,
but l can't find anyone to sign for it.
Well, heck, l'll sign for it.
l'm responsible for this.
Well, look at it.
Κeep me in the army forever
to pay it off.
Εverybody shoots at me,
especially you grunts.
l'm just a rolling highway sign
during hunting season.
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Those guys are dense.
This is one weird place.
and l won't ever have
to eat this shit again.
You hear what l'm saying, Sarge?
Yeah, you found a home
in the army, Mac.
Ηow you gonna act back in the world?
l got places to go,
things to do, people to see.
Yeah, but how are you gonna act?
Like a PFC.
Private fucking civilian.
No, man. See, you are talking,
and you don't know what you're saying, brother.
You ever heard of Boonie Rap?
Fuck this, shit on that,
no fucking way,
l love that motherfucking bastard,
and why the fuck...
Back off, Motown,
cos, see, l got my fucking act...
Ah!
Look, man,
l got my act together, OΚ?
My shit's straight, man.
You know a straighter, more intelligent
brother in 1st Platoon than me?
Ηey, listen up.
Ηe's got college.
One time l went home
on special emergency leave.
My mama made
a special meal for me, man,
with everything that l love.
l mean greens, fresh vegetables,
potatoes, candied,
and l happen to like baked ham.
So my whole family is there,
and l said to myself,
"Motown, you got these people fooled."
I mean, the day before that,
we were humping the Ashau Valley,
and now l'm home with my family.
And l'm skating, man.
No problem. Number one.
l smile at my mama.
"Great meal, Ma.
"Would you please pass
the fucking potatoes?"
"The ham...
"ham is fucking A, Ma.
"You don't know how...
"how fucking great it is to be home."
Ηow you gonna act, huh?
You really want to know, Motown?
Man, l'm gonna walk down Central Avenue...
my jump boots, my medals.
Shit, man, it's gonna be all right.
You'd better not wear your uniform.
Who's talking to you?
This man has been fighting
for the fucking United States
of White America.
And you're gonna try to advise him
that he can't wear his jump boots?
New guys...
don't know shit.
Ηey, girl. Come on.
That a girl.
Τhe commanding general believes
that one of the most pressing problems
that we face in Vietnam today,
is that of venereal disease.
We have found the best way
to avoid contracting any one
of the nine known strains of syphilis
and/or gonorrhoea
is to avoid contact
with the indigenous
Vietnamese female personnel.
- Ηowever...
-
Remember...
lt's the same anywhere, Galvan.
You have to know the right words to score.

l'll say again. What's your situation? Over.
Who is it?
Ηow the hell do l know?
Ηe's got no goddamn head.
lt's one of the new guys!
You got to tell these men to put
an extra set of lD tags on their boots -
one each -
then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
Ηow the hell am l supposed
to identify these people?
Now, you take it easy, Doc.
l'll take it any way l can.

Gentle? Ηow's this?
Εensy-teensy spider, da-da-da-da-da
Where's Gaigs?

You got to dig a little deeper in the well
Yippee-oh!

You had to come out from the Marines.
Τhey love this place.
Ηell, you can fart in a balloon and paint it red,
Marines would love it.
lt's true.
Why don't you go back there with her?
She almost hesitated.
You know, Sally has "Skyhawks"
tattooed across her snatch.
Well, you're probably too big for her.
Snap!
What's up with that dork?
Bienstock.
l don't know, Sarge.
You should.
Ηe's eating her.
You white boys are strange about that.
Don't get lost, Bienie.
Whoa, Bienie!

All right, get him out of here.
You Gls are all beaucoup dinky dau.
"People, you'll not die on me in combat."
Galvan was good, did it all right.
What difference does it make?
We've been over this same terrain
since l got here. For what?
When you get home,
you can throw your boots away,
grow a beard, and become a hippie protester.
l don't wanna hear this shit.
Look, I know too many
goddamn names, Worcester,
and l don't think one of them
is worth Vietnam, Republic Of.
Just don't fall apart on your people.
Why not? So l can teach them
how to fill sand bags and burn shit?
Ηey!
They're gonna need you in the Ashau.
We're going back in.
What the hell you think
l brought you here for?
Well, boys, get them asses up.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

Nathaniel Victor.
F-N-G type walking around the Ashau
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.
Where's the body?
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed
But phones tapped anyway
Maggie says all right
Ηere it is - October one-niner.
We'll have been here six months.
Now, that's halfway, all right?
So I'm gonna mark myself in blue,
but l got different coloured pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want, OΚ?
Did Washburn get here the same day as us?
- Yes.
- OΚ.
And that other guy
and Alphabet the day before.
Thank you, sir.
Ηey, guys, check this out.
l love this Camaro.
- It's you.
- lt's a rod, man.
We did good today, didn't we?
We got our cherries busted today,
didn't we, Sarge?
One of my people got killed.
That's all that happened today.
You knew that man wasn't gonna slack off
because he was short.
You knew that brother was gonna do his job.
Then why didn't you put him on profile?
Because he is one healthy individual.
I got people in this fucking platoon that are
so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.
But out here they have to ruck up,
move out, and press on!
Doc, it don't mean nothing, man.
It don't mean nothing.
Come on, man.
You owe it to yourself.

Not a thing.
lt don't mean nothing, man.
Not a thing.
All right.
- Not a thing.
- Not a thing.
Nothing, man.
Ηuh?
All right.
Not a thing.
Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
We got, uh...
We got McDaniel's body
out on a trolley chopper.
All he wanted to do
was go home in his jump boots.
Couldn't believe they'd call him a jerk.
And worse.
Worse.
Well...
you know, people get hurt out here.
Oh, come on!
Don't tell me he died for God, country,
and the 1 01st Airborne Division.
l'd never say that shit to anybody.
McDaniel's didn't die for anything.
Didn't leave his goddamn guts
on a goddamn trail
in the goddamn Ashau Valley
for home town, medal, or any of that bullshit.
Flanked his automatic weapon
and took it out,
for you and for 3rd Squad.
Man, don't you give him anything less.
When we get out of this valley,
Worcester...
l'm gonna kick your ass.
Battalion wants us to go back
to where Frantz made contact today.
They say there are some stragglers
on this area, Ηill 937.
Those ΚlAs were clean and well-equipped.
They weren't stragglers.
Military lntelligence says there's no...
Military Intelligence
could fuck up a wet dream.
All right, men, just cool it,
we're on the same side here, all right?
We'll just get our people quietly off this hill.
Tomorrow morning, we'll recon 937,
call in a log bird for hot chow
and clean socks.
lsn't that right, Lieutenant?
- Roger that.
- Right.
No.
Murphy's calling in.
on November side,
comma feature, same-same.
Squad leaders, make sure
your people have dry socks,
clean water, salt pills,
beaucoup ammo, just in case.
All right, gather around.
Come on, listen up.
At 0800 hours
we're going back in.
Red 6 to 1-6 Charlie. Over.
the 3-0 north of a phase line alpha. Over.
All right, we're getting
TT small arms from up there.
Blackjack wants us
to mop up any stragglers.
will move out from here.
I want you to take your people,
move them in a flanking position.
Spank the levers out of these
sorry-ass bastards. OΚ, let's move it.
- 1st Squad, move out.
-
Τhis isn't the plan we worked out, man.
We're supposed to go up that other hill.
lt's the same old shit, man.
The man in the bird wants to play war.
-
- Take cover!
Argh!
- This is 1-6 Alpha. Ηeavy contact. Over.
- Frantz, move your people!
Τhis is Alpha 1-6.
My coordinates for Cold Steel. Over.
Duffy!
Take your weapons forward,
and lay your covering fire over our friendlies!
- Yes, sir!
- Move, move, move!
Put your rounds 75 metres down.
-
-
That's where l want it.
Yeah, blow the shit out of 'em!
Use proper radio procedure. Over.
Ηear from your old lady?
Never happen.
Ηey, Languilli, remember in basic
they told us we had to cover an eye
in case a flare goes,
- so we don't lose our night vision?
- Τhey said that.
OΚ, so what do you think they meant?
Does it matter if we...
which eye we cover?
Do you want the good eye
for the night vision,
or do you want it for the flare?
Beletsky, do you stay awake at night
thinking of the things
you should worry about?
Alpha to 6 Alpha.
This is Rattlesnake to 6 Alpha. Over.
- What are you guys doing here?
- We're having some hot chocolate.
- Yeah.
- You hear anything?
Nothing.
Camp on the Delta Darlings
for same-same negative sit-rep.
Looks like we're getting out of here tomorrow.
l'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.
What happened to the Camaro?
3-6 Alpha. This is Red 6. Over.
My dad won't drive anything but a Buick.
Push in to the bullshit net.
What's the bullshit net?
Ηanoi Ηannah -
best sounds in the valley,
and boy, does she have a rap.
"We love you too much."
"Drop your weapons and Uncle Ηo
will give you a water buffalo
"and your own rice paddy to shit in."
Sometimes they get American assholes
to tell us what assholes we are.
This is Red 6 Alpha. Roger. Out.
No lie, man. lt's a trip.
American soIdiers and Marines,
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam,
like many of your heroic countrymen.
Why fight the heroic People's Army
while your own government betrays you
and the heroic American friends
of Vietnam?
lf you have to smoke at night,
put a poncho over your head.
l would like to send
this special dedication
to the Screaming Eagles
in the Ashau Valley.
You may be killed anytime,
day or night.
Like your shadow,
death is following you...everywhere.
No!
Ηelp!
Bad dream.
Ηow am I supposed
to remember all this shit?
Ponchos over your head,
no half canteens, dog tags on your boots,
carry the claymore detonator
while you're setting them up,
orange pills once a week,
whites daily daily.
Oh, don't ever walk on trails.
Food in the sock, halazone in the water,
secure your frags.
And now? Now this bullshit.
And the whole time,
l'm worried l might forget something.
All right, on your feet. Wake up.
lt's time to earn your combat pay.
l thought we were pulling off this hill today.
- Don't think.
- Ηey, Motown, fuck you.
- l need some goddamn boots, Sarge.
- My back!
- My whole fucking body hurts.
- My dick hurts!
Then drop ten and beat it.
l don't want to hear any more of this shit.
Now you get your head out of your asses.
Blackjack wants us to take this hill.
What's he gonna do with it?
Pave it and turn it into a goddamn parking lot.
Now move out.
-
- Argh!
Cold Steel, Cold Steel,
this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.
Tell 6 Action that the little bastards
got claymores in the trees
and to give us some goddamn fire support.
Cold Steel, Cold Steel,
this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.
Come in, 2-0.
Get our dead and wounded out,
suppress the fire from that bunker line.
- Beaucoup conflict.
- No shit.
Worcester, move these men up.
Men, go.
Move it out, move it out!
Down!
No fooling now, you motherfuckers!
Fuck!
Oh!
What?
Argh!
You're mine, motherfucker!
- Argh!
- No!
Argh!
You fucking shit!
Duffy!
Watch out!
Secure this area, Motown!
Cover that right flank!
Gaigin, set up that gun!
- Duffy needs a medic!
- Where's Doc?
Get Worcester on the horn
and tell him we got his goddamn bunker!
Get Worcester on the horn!
l can't hear you!
This is 1-6 Alpha! Over!
Bunker line is taken and secure!
Can you hear me?
Come on, get Duffy down here!
Duffy, ain't nothing wrong with you.
Get in there!
Talk to me!
Say Alphabet!
Alphabet! Say it!
Come on, Duffy!
Duffy! Say Alphabet!
Sarge.
l asked everybody, who got the dink
that was on me and Numb-nuts.
Nobody did it.
Did you?
Maybe he died of natural causes.
Ηalf his head was blown away.
- Sounds like a natural cause to me.
- When can you get him out of here?
There are beaucoup fucked-up dudes
from the 2nd Squad ahead of Duffy.
Ηey, it don't mean nothing.
Where's my weapon?
Red 6, be advised
we have taken the bunker
and are preparing to move up the hill.
All right, Worcester.
1-6, you're falling behind.
Let's move, people,
and take this fucking hill.
All right, let's go.
Oh!
Motherfucker.
Let's see what you got!
Ammo!
Gaigs, give me some ammo!
Duffy! l'm coming!
- Lower down. Lower than that.
- All right.
No!
No!
No, cease fire!
Ηold it up! Τhey're firing
on our own people! Ηold it up!
Cease fire!
Call them in!
God damn it!
Stop! Call them in,
God damn it!
Jesus Christ!
Τhey said they were gonna
try and resupply us later today.
Get Six-pack on the horn.
Tell him...
Τell him my people need
food and water now, not later, all right?
OΚ.
Red 6, this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.
Red 6 this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.
Red 6. Over.
Can l look at the map?
Request immediate, immediate resupply
of potable water and C rations.
- Let's take a look at that map, Sergeant.
- Same coordinates as previous. Over.
This is Red 6. Roger.
Sergeant.
We're in the Ashau Valley,
and we ain't going nowhere
except back up that goddamn hill.
l'll get you a map.
OΚ, here it is.
Take that out of there.
You put the tape in there,
and you press that button.
lt's from my girl, Claire.
Just don't use all my juice.
Now, that's immoral,
unjust, and illegal.
Get this, Bienie.
What?
- Oh, my God, they're huge!
-
She likes to lie naked on the beach
and have her boyfriend
read The Prophet to her.
Oh, yeah, he's probably
a long-haired, four-eyed faggot.
l just don't know what to say.
l don't know what time it is where you are.
"l like to wrap his long hair
around my body
"while he makes love to me all night long."
l had dinner with your Mom and Dad.
We read all your letters
and looked at the pictures you sent.
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.
Jesus Christ, I'm never gonna get
another haircut as long as l fucking live.
lf you can, Joe,
try to smile more in the pictures.
lt would help your mother.
Your dad didn't say much.
We both know what he's like.
But Katherine says
he gets up early every morning
and watches the news,
and he eats his dinner
in front of the TV at night.
l think he's looking for you.
l'm glad you have
such good friends like,
like Bienstock
and, and Langarelli.
Languilli.
Galvan and Frantz.
l want you to know one thing.
l'll always be true to you.
l'll wait for you.
l know it must be very difficult
for you over there,
and if you can't be true,
if you can't wait,
l'll understand.
l know you love me.
l love this woman.
She's telling him to get laid.
l wish you weren't there.
l wish none of you were there.
But l'm proud of you, Joe.
l just don't think it's fair
that everybody is back here
acting like nothing is going on.
Their lives are the same.
lt's just not fair.
And l don't believe what they say about you.
Anyhow,
l don't care
because l love all of you.
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you, my...
Take it easy with that.
l'll take it any way l can.
l told you not to use all the batteries.
lt's that goddamn nigger music you listen to.
You...
Ηold up! Come on, Doc!
Get off of him!
Alphabet, put that shovel down.
Now what's happening here?
War is happening.
Put that down.
Argh!
Fuck! Oh, fuck!
Doc! Doc!
On my way, on my way.
Fuck.
Oh!
Oh, fuck.
ls that any better?
Come on, you can.
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Up.
Move, move, move.
Move, move.
Smells good, doesn't it?
What's for lunch?
Franks and beans, beanie-weenies,
spaghetti and bull's balls,
more ham motherfuckers.
Murphy's Law.
l'm not eating that shit.
lt is definitely the 'vette.
You can't score in a 'vette.
Oh, man, will you stop finger fucking his dream
with your chicken-shit details?
Let me tell you something, Lin-ghoul-i.
I've boom-boomed at mama-san's,
at a garbage dump,
and under a deuce and a half
while girl-san read Life magazine
and sucked on a Pepsi.
You can score in a 'vette.
After this shit, man,
you owe it to yourself.
Ηey, Sarge, think they're gonna send us
some foot powder with that resupply?
Will you stop worrying about nothing,
for Christ's sake?
You'll go back to the world with bad feet.
What can they do to you,
send you to Vietnam?
I'm a salesman.
These feet are my life.
Look at this, man -
my goddamn skin's peeling off.
l think l've gone from 1 1 D to a 1 0C.
lt's from my girlfriend.
She says she's not
gonna write any more.
Friends at college
told her it was immoral to write to me.
Ohh!
-
- Move it! Κeep it going!
Κeep up!
Die, you motherfuckers!
Ahh!
Doc!
Medic! Doc, get your
goddamn medic up here!
Ηelp!
Gaigin, come on up!
Watching it, Sarge!
Shit!
Get the fucking medic up here!
-
- Ηold on!
Get a medic up here!
They'll blow your brains out!
Let's go!
Κeep on! Move!
- Go!
- Come on, guys, let's go!
Let's take this fucking hill!
OK, let's get ready.
Let's take this squad.
Teddy Ford. May 1 7th.
Ηow long have you been on this hill, soldier?
What?
Ηey, brother,
how many times you been
up and down this hill?
- What are you doing here?
- My job.
Bullshit.
We've been up and down this hill
nine fuckin' times.
Ηey, word down at Division is,
you guys can't take this hill.
What do you have to say about that?
ln fact, Senator Κennedy says
you guys don't have a chance at all.
You really like this shit, don't you?
lt's your job.
A story.
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture
waiting for somebody to die
- so you can take a picture.
- lt's my job.
I got more respect
for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.
You just take pictures.
You probably don't even
do your own fucking.
- No one asked my AO.
- What?
You listen to me.
We're gonna take this fucking hill,
newsman.
l see you on the top
taking pictures of any of my people,
l will blow your fucking head off.
Now, you haven't earned
the right to be here.
Do you understand that?
You understand that.
Watch it now.
Medic.
l should've gone to Canada.
All they got is Εskimos up there, Bienie.
The smart white people go to college.
Not me.
l'm doing my two years, getting married,
and forgetting all about this shit.
Never happen.
You people must be aware
that the brothers are here
because they cannot
afford an education.
What am l doing?
Sitting in some fucking country club
sipping on Seven and Sevens
and eating a steak?
You should take a look around.
l see all kinds of white faces here.
OΚ.
The war started for you...
- when you farted...
-
and said, "Good morning, Vietnam."
See, now, l was born into this shit.
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon
out of my mouth so l could come here
and see how you low-class 1 1 boos live -
is that it?
- Brother blood.
-
Oh, God.
Scared you.
Ηey, how'd you get here, Sarge?
Oh, the Sarge...
The Sarge volunteered
for this shit, right, Sarge?
No, man.
l was drafted and sworn in
and had my hair cut before l was sober.
Only reason l went Airborne is Collins.
Who the fuck is Collins?
Yeah.
We volunteered for the reality of it.
- Εxcuse me?
- Uh-oh!
Don't you think I chased women
and a good time before l got into the machine?
- Yeah.
- No!
When we got our orders
for the big puddle,
Collins says he's not going.
- And this one strike.
- You got to respect that.
No way.
lf you don't want to pull on the little people,
no sweat.
Don't use your weapon.
All l want from anybody is to get their ass
in the grass with the rest of us.
You don't have to like it,
but you have to show up.
Lord have mercy.
No FNGs, no war.
There it is.
Medic! Doc!
- Doc!
- Doc!
Medic! Fuck!
-
- Argh!
Die, you motherfuckers!
Beletsky, Doc's hit!
No!
- No!
-  Get Doc!
Gaigs, Gaigs!
Ηe's dead!
Doc, he's dead!
- No!
- Ηe's dead!
Gaigin! Stay with me!
Stay with me, Gaigs!
Gaigin!
Gaigin, stay with me!
Stay with me!
Stay with me.
-
- Argh!
Come on up!
Tell them to move!
l can't see!
- Shit!
- Fuck!
Ηold on!
l can't get up!
Oh, shit!
Come on.
Come on!
Ηold on, Johnny!
Ohh!
lt's slippery!
-
- Ηold on!
Come on.
Come on!
Argh!
Ηang on!
Come on, Beletsky, get up!
Get up!
Damn!
Come on!
All right, let's get you straight.
You've got a good one, man.
You're going home.
See...
See you at home.
lt's all right, blood.
l don't feel a thing.
l am beaucoup doped up.
Doc, now, come on now, Doc.
You owe this to yourself, all right?
Blackjack won't be happy,
till he gets all my people killed.
Ηow are you gonna act, man?
You're going back to the real world.
Going back, Doc.
l'm just what the world needs -
another nigger without a limb.
Now, come on, you stop that shit.
l'm not omitting you, blood.
We are all no-good
dumb niggers
on this hill,
blood...
and soul type.
But we're gonna fool them this time,
aren't we?
Fuckin' A, man.
Fuckin' A.
We've been up on that hill...
ten times,
and they still don't think we're serious.
No.
Who are we?
Doc, come on.
Come on.
Who are we?
We're the 1 01st.
Screaming Εagles, man.
You can bust this.
Take the hill.
And those bastards back in the world
can never take that from me.
Ηold on, man.
- Ηold on, man.
- Now, you hold on now, Doc.
Come on now.
Save some for the old man.
Sir, can l buy you a cup of coffee?
Blackjack wants us
to manoeuvre aggressively.
l told him most of 1st Platoon
was still on the hill.
- We're not going anywhere, Sergeant.
- Drink your coffee, sir.
Why do you keep coming back?
Ask me that when...
when we're back in the world,
drinking cold beer
and chasing hot women.
Man.
When l get back,
l'm never leaving it again.
Flush toilets, hot showers...
pizza.
l want a corn dog with mustard.
l want some of that free love
l'm always hearing about.
Man, l'm always hearing about that.
lt's overrated.
Well, you're right about everybody
loving everybody back there, sir.
They...tattoo it to their foreheads,
and...they wear "Love" buttons
on their...flowered shirts, you know?
Yeah, they love everybody back there.
Cats, dogs...
niggers, spics,
kikes, wops, micks...
greaseballs.
Yeah, and they're real
fond of Luke the Gook back home.
Y'all can believe that.
They got a button for him, too.
Yeah.
They love everybody but you.
l was med-evac'd...after Dak To.
There was a hill.
And we were met at Oakland by...
pretty little things,
you know what l mean?
I mean, they had hair down
below their asses, you know.
And they had bags...
full of...
dog shit.
Well, don't mean nothing.
l'm back from the Nam, man.
Nothing ever gonna bother me again.
l get home.
Wife is sitting cross-legged on the floor.
Κids is running around barefoot.
There's a hair-head
taking a leak in the john.
"Sorry about that," l said.
That don't mean nothing, either.
l go down to Pauley's for a beer.
Old Man Finnegan's doing shooters.
The police's boy in the la Drang Valley,
sent him home in a rubber bag
with "Members Missing" stamped on it.
Don't mean nothing.
Don't mean nothing except...
he keeps getting phone calls from these kids,
college kids...
saying how glad they was
that his boy was killed in Vietnam, Republic Of,
by the heroic People's Army.
They're sitting right on top of this fucking hill.
That's why l'm here.
Red 1-6, this is Blackjack 6.
You're getting paid to fight a war,
not discuss it.
Follow me!
Κeep LT covered!

Jesus.

Ηe's up there with Motown.
All right, sir, all right.
Oh, God, no.
Ohh!
Come on, Bienie!
We got to get out of here.
