You're lying to me.
I'm not.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you want from me.
I swear I don't.
I have three children.
The first thing you have to learn
as a father is to know
when your children are lying to you.
You're lying to me,
and if you don't stop,
I'm going to use one of those tortures
your people are  famous for
on your little body
until you tell me what I want to know.
For the last time,
give me the numbers.
- Mei!
-
How dare you come here!
You have no right!
- Ma, enough! Stop!
- You've no right to be here. No right!
You should be in jail!
You should be in jail!
You get out of here!
You get out of here.
- I'm sorry.
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Piece of garbage. The kid
should never been in there with me.
Luke, come on. What, are you crazy, man?
- Get off.
- Get off, now!
I never liked you, Luke.
You're a better fighter than 90%
of the guys you go in the cage with,
but you just let 'em pound on you
like you're a side of beef.
You already lost to every chump
in the circuit.
But last night, of all nights,
you're supposed to go down
in the second, you son of a bitch.
- Once.
- Back off.
I hit him once. Where'd you find him,
the fucking playground?
YouTube, you asshole.
The kid's an internet sensation
until you put him in a coma,
which frankly
I do not give a shit about.
But you cost me a million dollars,
which is nothing
compared what you cost Docheski.
Yeah. You recognise the name?
He was betting on you big time
to take the dive.
And he's gonna take it out on me too
'cause he knows I'm the schmuck
that set this whole thing up.
Unless I deliver your head
with a down payment.
You know how the Russians are.
Mei.
Mei.
You got the right number,
so leave the right message.
Call me when you get this, Annie.
I mean right away.
If you're out, don't go home.
If I'm scaring you, that's good.
Call me.
Annie?
That's it?
I heard you were
some kind of a tough guy.
No fighting?
You're just going to sit on the floor
like a dog who wants to die?
Sorry it had to be so messy.
The boy is still learning.
And I'm not a doctor,
but I think she was eating for two.
We're like Charlie Manson family, no?
My father was going to send
someone else, but I'm making my bones.
You make your bones by killing someone
who can hurt you back.
And who would that be? You?
Well, why not?
You just killed your wife.
I didn't kill her. You did.
Look, you want to hurt me? Good.
I want to see you try.
Get it over with.
Over? You cost my father money,
made my family look bad.
Now we're going to make
an extra special example out of you.
So, we looked into your records.
Not much to find.
Work for city,
garbage collection, sanitation.
Good benefits but no glamour, eh?
Father and mother dead,
no brothers or sisters,
which is too bad,
because I would like
to take them from you too.
But you love your wife.
We know that.
So here's the deal.
You're free to go,
but we will have eyes on you.
Not always, but when
you least expect it, we'll be there.
Anyone you try to make friends with
or even talk to,
other than ordering a hot dog
or something,
will die, like your wife,
because of you.
Of course, you can always end it,
jump off a bridge,
throw yourself in front of a train,
damn your eternal soul to hell,
if you believe in that kind of bullshit.
Personally, I don't.
So I'd go for it if I were you.
But I am not you.
Thank God.
So do what you want.
If you're still here tomorrow,
we're going  kill the landlady.
- What was her name?
-  Tobolovsky.
Mrs Tobolovsky.
Nice lady.
Clean up the mess, garbage man.
All right, she's your daughter
and she's an American citizen.
I ain't gonna ask what the deal is
with her. That's your business.
But I'm gonna tell you,
pulling strings is hard work,
Your price, Captain Wolf?
Chinatown precinct take goes up 20%.
Bronx 121st, Brooklyn divisions,
each go up by 10%, monthly.
That's a steep price for a passport
and some papers for a little girl.
Things are tough all over.
Chinatown gets upped 10%.
Bronx and Brooklyn will settle
for the current rate
and the fact
that we won't start shooting
cops and their families in the streets
like dogs at the first sign of pressure.
Things are tough all over.
Hey, man, I know you.
I saw your fight in Jersey.
It was really good.
You knocked that guy out.
- No.
- That was some good shit, man.
Great fight.
The casino?
Exactly 800,000?
It's almost 800.
I'm not asking you if it's almost 800.
I want the exact number.
$785,370.
- And the week before?
- It's losing money.
- What?
- Why?
Because he was hurting business,
and business is a serious matter.
I understand business.
But why beat him
if you were going to kill him anyway?
Fuck you. Fuck you!
- You can't come in the shelter.
- Just trying to get something to eat!
Wrap it up. Lights out in five.
Wrap it up.
Come on, guys.
Nice kicks.
They'd better be here in the morning
or you'll be wearing them on your ears,
'cause I'll chew your feet off
at the goddamn ankles.
I could really use some new shoes, man.
I'll do whatever you want, you know?
Whatever gets you through the night.
- I just... I can't take another...
- Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up and take them.
I've still got my old ones.
Gangrene's setting in.
I will. Thank you, man.
Jesus loves you, brother.
Jesus loves you.
Lights out. Wake-up call's 7am.
Shh.
Mei, I have sad news.
I heard them talking and...
your mother is gone.
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.
They weren't going to tell you,
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray
for her soul to find its way to heaven.
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...
I won't say anything. Thank you.
Everybody up.
Shelter needs to be cleared by 9am.
Bed reservations for tonight
need to be made by 3:30.
Please remove
all your personal belongings.
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.
Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.
So you wanna tell us what happened?
Someone liked his shoes.
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.
You were right here.
You could have said something.
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?
Come into this shelter again
and I'm gonna run your raggedy ass
back out into the street.
Hey! Watch where you're going, man.
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.
I got money.
He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.
- This guy giving you trouble?
- He's crazy, Officer.
- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.
Jesus Christ.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Unbelievable.
- Look at him.
- Look at him?
How about the smell?
Think I'll call the boys.
You miss us, partner?
Welcome back to the force.
Mei...
I'm sorry. I can't let them have you.
Mei! Get back here!
- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
upon a time.
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies
would ever be on the same page
about anything?
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.
I mean, we felt bad for Annie an' all.
Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.
Word come up from the street
you were back,
we couldn't believe our fucking ears.
Why would you  back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?
Like the moon.
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.
Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,
bus, train...
I got my money on suicide by cop.
Come on, take it.
Take a shot. Come on.
Annie's waiting for you.
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?
Hmm?
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.
You ought to know that, Lesky.
You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna  me in the back.
Wouldn't be your first time.
Why don't you just end it?
What are you waiting for?
More people around you to die?
What are you waiting for?
For the last time,
give me the numbers.
You're a very brave girl, and clever.
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,
where you're going to be and when?
- Someone told you.
- That's right.
Can you guess who?
Your friend, the one who told you
about your poor mother
when the scum
who took you from home would not.
She's working for us with a smile.
Ling.
In English.
I said speak in English.
Well?
She won't tell me anything.
My father is a patient man.
I am not.
Tell him what he wants to know.
- Or I'll...
-
NYPD! Open the door!
- What the hell?
- This is the police.
- We got reports of a disturbance.
-
Look, you can make this easy
or you can make it hard.
Open the door or we come in by force.
Bullshit, blue.
You come in here, you go out feet first,
I swear on my mother.
Yeah, they're in there, Captain.
They're not cooperating. You better
get down here before things go to hell.
Negative, negative. This is big.
I'm going back to the station to monitor
the city. I'll get back to you.
All right, we got 'em pinned down.
You know what I want.
We have a deal. Get the girl,
alive if you can, dead if you can't.
We go in, Brooklyn's take
goes up by 10%. That's the new deal.
-
- Hold on, I got an incoming call.
- Emile, what's up?
- Take your men off, Wolf.
Whatever the Chinese offered to you,
I'll up it by 5%.
Get her back here.
I got the Russians
offering to up Brooklyn's take by 7%,
Bronx the same.
So I don't know what to tell you.
My guys are willing
to go to war over this.
You're gonna be stuck between us
and the Russians like Hitler,
fighting on two fronts,
so you better think hard about this one.
Hey, Mac. Both these bastards
are willing to pay a stiff price
for this little Chink girl.
- Whatever she's got, I want it.
- So what's our play?
I get the Russians
to drop their guard, you go in.
She catches a bullet,
I want you to take out every last one
All right, Emile, your offer's good.
I'm gonna call my guys off}
but only 'cause I like you better.
Bullshit. You're a greedy bastard, Wolf.
You got the scent of something big
and now you want it all for yourself.
But I have to tell you something before
you send your men in guns blazing.
She's gone.
- What do you mean, she's gone?
I mean she escaped, and with
all your men out there, I can't follow.
that will be a thing you regret
as long as you live.
Docheski, what  she have?
The girl is Chinese, 11 years old.
She speaks Mandarin and English.
A photo is being disseminated.
You are to find her
and bring her straight to Centre Street.
She's heading for subway.
Sorry, Annie.
Lost my lock
on the Russian cell on Jay Street.
Sounds like they went into
the subway station. Manhattan bound.
Hey.
You? The garbage collector?
You've got bad information.
I never collected garbage.
I disposed of it.
Don't lose sleep. He had it coming.
Are you all right?
-  Get out! Get out!
-  Move.
It's OK.
Girl was last seen entering
Jay Street Station. Red alert.
Once found, she needs to be brought
to Captain Wolf at Centre Street.
Whoa. Easy. Easy there, hon.
We're the police.
Everything's all right.
Hey, what's your name, hon?
This is her.
I don't know. They all look alike to me.
- You got that picture up?
- Yeah, let me see.
Fucking New York City.
Don't see somebody for years.
Then you bump into them twice
in the same day.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you.
What the hell did you do, kid?
You know, those men chasing you are bad.
You wanna tell me why they're after you?
- You understand me?
-
Speak English?
The other way! Cars go the other way!
Are you a crazy man?
Hold on.
If this goes on, a lot of
innocent people are gonna get hurt.
You want that?
Good. Then do what I say.
You OK?
Let's go.
I'm not five years old.
Then keep up.
- You had her and you lost her.
- No, Captain, we didn't lose her.
She was taken by force.
- The Russians?
- No, not the Russians.
Well...
- It was Luke Wright.
- What?
- Captain Wolf?
- Not now, David.
The mayor wants you, Captain.
- Put him through on two.
- He's not on the phone.
He wants you at the mansion, yesterday.
There you go.
- Thank you, Mr lvanov.
- Thank you.
Mr lvanov?
Here you are, Mr lvanov. Room 1012.
- Tenth Floor.
- Thank you.
You like a nice hotel.
I've never stayed in a nice hotel.
No  gonna look for us in one.
Would I love a shower right now.
You could use one.
I could have just let those Russians
grab you on the train.
Why did you save me?
I didn't save you. You saved me.
I'm paying you um.
My name's Luke.
Mei.
You have parents, Mei?
- I have a father.
- What's his name?
Chang Quan.
Chang Quan?
If we're talking about the same guy,
he didn't have any kids
last time I checked.
Any made since
wouldn't be a day over three years old.
I'm adopted.
He bring you over from back home?
Chang isn't the fatherly type.
Why are you here, Mei?
To count.
You were sent over by the old guy,
Chang's boss. What's his name?
Old school.
No computers, no electronic trails.
Just what you have
in your head, right?
- You know Jiao Han?
- I know of him.
He told me a number,
a very long number.
I was going someplace where I would get
another number and more instructions,
but the Russian came and shot everyone.
Then the police came and I ran away.
Now you know everything.
Happiness for you?
You wanna go back to Han Jiao?
I make too much trouble. Bad business.
After I do what he  he kills me.
Good business.
So what about this number?
It's a long, boring number.
I can tell it to you.
It wouldn't mean anything to me.
How do you know it's one number
and not a bunch of separate numbers?
You're a crazy man but not so stupid.
Is there anything interesting to you
about these numbers?
- Maybe a few of them.
- Why?
Because they have a three or a seven
before them.
All the numbers are random,
but five of them has a seven before
and eight of them has a three before.
That's too many times to be random.
- What else?
- Nothing.
So the three and the seven
are interesting
because they happen too many times
to be random.
Because they're not numbers.
They're words.
Right left or left right.
Old school. Combination to a safe.
In the hotel?
-
- Where?
About five eleven, brown hair, 30s.
Probably came in here
less than a few hours ago.
Sir, we're not allowed
to discuss our guests.
So he's a guest? Did he  in?
I'm sorry, sir.
We're not at liberty to...
He would have been with a Chinese girl,
I'm her father
and I'm very worried about her.
I'm so sorry.
I can call the police for you.
Do that and I blow your brains out.
- Now...
- Don't move.
...what room is he in?
I think maybe
I put him on the 10th floor.
Room.
I swear he didn't have
a little girl with him.
- Room.
- I just need to check.
Then check quick
or I put a bullet in your brain.
- Quick.
- Put your hands up.
- You don't want any part of this.
- Hands up so I can see 'em.
Come on!
I thought you said
no one would look for us here.
I turned it off
no one could call when I was...
It doesn't need to be on.
- Get back!
- Wait!
Get down on the floor.
Everybody back!
Write down the numbers,
just the  with the three
and the seven in front of 'em, quick.
You, get over there! Get down! Get down!
I'll try to get you someplace safe.
We get separated,
don't tell them you told me anything.
- Mei, if they try to scare you...
- Try? I'm  scared already.
Yeah, me to. Remember, lie.
We're almost there.
If you see them downstairs,
try not to kill the girl.
Back inside.
Follow them!
I'm going back down to cut them off.
The  are here.
Hold them off until I give the word.
Do not let them in!
Everybody stay down!
You ain't going nowhere! Stay!
Hey, where you going?
Get down! No! Get back down!
- Get back!
- Move! Move!
-
-
Get up! Everybody up!
We're getting out of the hotel. Up!
-
' UP Or I start shooting you! Up!
Moving to corner of 58.
We got a suspect.
Hey, don't move!
Don't move!
Into the street and keep moving!
Anyone who doesn't dies like this!
Into the street!
Repeat, hold your fire!
They're civilians!
Suspect is in the crowd.
Suspect is in the crowd.
Hey, stop right there!
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
That's my car!
Do something, he took my fucking car!
Head downtown.
I'll give you an address in a minute.
Shit.
- Hey, buddy, you wanna give me address?
- In a minute. Just hold on.
He's here? Luke Wright is back
in the city, in my city?
-
- He's been back for a while.
- A while? What's a while?
- Maybe a year. It's hard to say.
Turn that goddamn thing off.
- Alex.
- Guys.
Yes, sir. Sorry, Your Honour.
What's going on, Wolf?
And how's Luke Wright involved in it?
I figured I might ask you
the same question.
Don't try to game me.
You're nothing but a pawn
playing on a board so big
you can't even see the edge.
That's all you've ever been.
I knew about Luke Wright, which is more
than you can say until five minutes ago.
What you know about Luke Wright
rates less than a paragraph
in a very fat book.
After the towers fell
and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,
I was the one
who formed the special task force
to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.
And don't you ever fucking forget that
I was the one who put you in charge.
I didn't forget. My work made you mayor.
Your work?
You think Luke
was just one of your
When I put together your team,
I knew it needed an edge
no ordinary detectives could give me,
something surgical.
I called friends in places buried
so deep they don't officially exist.
They were sympathetic.
A week later they sent Luke Wright.
wise guys who vanished
over the last seven years,
you think that was internecine war?
Those coke kings
you found in the gutter in Harlem.
Freddy Petrovich in Brooklyn.
Tommy Lau in Chinatown.
Luke Wright is a ghost.
A very deadly ghost.
It worked like a charm too.
Then you dicks had to get greedy
and pad your pockets.
Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.
When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,
it took some people with a lot of bronze
stuck to their pyjamas
to talk him off the ledge.
Yeah, my team gets dismantled.
We're peons again.
But if Luke Wright's so connected,
how  he wind up in Jersey
cage fighting on the B circuit?
Do I look like a shrink?
Get everybody on this.
Once Luke Wright gets on a roll,
only one man in this city
can take him on one-on-one.
but there was just a major gun battle
downtown at a hotel.
Media's going nuts.
You're gonna need to make a statement.
Han Jiao is in the city also.
He give this little Chinese girl
something, I don't know what.
Luke Wright grabbed her before I could.
- What?
- I said Luke Wright...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard you the first time.
Close every exit out of Manhattan.
Make sure that neither Wright or the
girl gets away, you get commissioner.
Let 'em go... you get a shovel
to dig your own grave.
That girl  not leave this city.
We recovered the girl, but the
information might have been compromised.
- Should we change our time frame?
-  Impossible.
Now that the whole damn thing
has gone supernova,
it's going to happen
and it's gonna happen tonight.
But the meeting place
needs to be changed.
- Where to?
- I'll let you know.
Here. Right here.
Slow down. Stop the car.
No, no, you don't bring
no hookers in my cab, man.
Just keep the meter running.
Ladies.
How about a drink?
Good evening.
- Evening.
- Will you be joining us for dinner?
- We don't have a reservation.
- That's OK.
We're busy tonight, but we should
be able to find you something.
We don't have any tables downstairs,
but there are some in the back.
Or you could sit upstairs if you like.
Sir? Sir?
Do you have a preference? Sir?
I think we'll just get a drink
at the bar.
I want you to give me a
turn round and walk out of here.
- But I thought...
- Just act like you forgot something.
Only don't come back.
Give me a white Russian, please,
and a fork.
- Fork?
- One of those.
What does he drive
and where is it parked?
A silver SUV in the alley outside.
'
-
- Vassily.
-  Not even close.
Who is this?
The guy who's been
killing your boys all night, Emile.
The guy who has your son tied up
in a very dark place.
Now, here's what I want.
shit
of what you want?
Do you think you can blackmail me
because you have Vassily?
- Kill him and go to hell.
- I'm going to hell all right.
-
- But I'm not gonna kill your boy.
A very badly treated pet.
I'm gonna do things to him
that'll make me ashamed
to look in the mirror afterward,
but I will do them.
Vassily's gonna tell me everything
he knows about your operation.
And then what you gonna do?
Tell the police?
- You want me to laugh?
- Who said anything about the police?
I'm gonna share the information
with the competition,
the ones I haven't already killed.
Anything they don't take from you,
I will.
Then I'm gonna take
your trophy children.
When I'm done, you won't even be
a memory of a memory.
- But that doesn't have to happen.
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what's in the safe.
- What safe?
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.
Kid was on her way to get a second
number. What's in the second safe?
Something worth $30 million.
- To who?
- No idea.
That's 'cause
you're only half-smart, Emile.
So here's the deal.
You tell me where the first safe is,
I take the money and let your boy go.
Lie to me and your world ends.
You have my word on that.
Idiot. I know
when a man is working alone
and you're as alone as one can be.
You need a small army
to get near that safe,
the kind of army I have.
Had. It's been shrinking by the minute.
Last chance before I hang up
and go to work on your son.
Going to kill me, garbage man?
You could have taken us out that day,
couldn't you?
But you just sat there,
let us ruin you,
let us make you nothing.
I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?
I wouldn't spend my time talking
if I were you.
Spend it praying that when this is over
that little girl's still alive.
Pray
When and where?
The underpass under the bridge,
one hour.
I'm sorry I pointed a gun at you
when the Russians attacked us, Mei.
- It was...
- Business. I know.
It's good. It's good you understand.
We're going to get this done
and you'll be safe
with me and Uncle Han.
I promise to be a better father to you
than the one
who left you and your mother.
There's no one in the world
who cares more about you.
You know that, don't you?
Well, the gang's all here.
Almost.
- Reddick have to call in sick?
- He's in the hospital, dickhead.
- You broke his trachea.
- I didn't know a trachea could break.
- Hope they can fix it.
- Yeah? How about I fix you?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here.
It's been a while, Luke.
Can't say I missed you.
- So, let's get down to business.
- Did you bring what I asked for?
- Toscanni's.
- Where else?
Mmm. That's good.
Been in restaurants all night.
All I got sewed was lead.
- Anyone got a light?
- You know what? Screw this.
Look, Captain, you asked us
to come here,  we came.
But I ain't gonna sit here
and listen to this scumbag's big mouth.
Shut up, Kolfax.
Still haven't quit, huh?
Hey. Hey, what the hell is that?
Combination of the safe
with 30 million bucks in it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Filthy piece of shit.
The only place it exists now is in here.
Remember that next time
your little trigger finger gets itchy.
Why would Han Jiou stash it
right in the middle of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den?
Because of sleaze-bucket cops
like you, Benoit,
who collect off of Chinatown's
busiest gambling den.
Where else would he surround it
with dozens of armed man
without attracting police attention?
Captain, why do we know this son of
a bitch on the level, huh? He's a bum.
Where'd you get your information?
There's an exchange happening tonight.
The Triad half of the deal
is in a safe in the casino.
No way I could get to it on my own,
so I called on you, my old pals.
is still a lot of money.
We're risking a lot, Captain.
You especially.
Everybody knows you got a bright future.
Promised by who? His Honour?
What carrot
is he teasing you with, Wolf?
He's gonna let you out in the street
knowing what you know now?
What's that supposed to mean?
His second term is gonna come to an end
and his hold on the city goes poof.
Just like that he's Joe Citizen again.
a nice retirement package.
What's he giving the Chinks?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be standing
here with you assholes, would I?
A bright future, huh?
Big headlines.
"Hero  take down New York City's
biggest underground gambling operation."
Five million bucks apiece
that no one will ever know about,
just to give it that extra  taste.
All right, who's been in there?
For Christ's sake, who's been in there?
- Me, Cap.
- You two, you're on point.
Place is packed with civilians,
exercise some judgment.
Remember, I got the combination.
You want that money, watch my back.
Where are you going?
Don't move! Stay!
Out of the way! Move!
Hey, you, settle down!
This way. Let's go.
Heads up.
Go.
Kolfax, take him out.
Cover him.
Open it. Take it!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.
I gotta get out of here.
Oh, fuck. Fuck, Captain.
God, you shit!
Shoot a man in the back, son of a bitch!
- All right, Mears, where we going?
- This way.
- The gates of paradise.
- Locked and bolted to sinners like us.
Yeah, well,
let's not wait for an invitation.
All right, you bastard. Get started.
Here's how we do this.
You put down your guns, I open the safe.
If you wanna  me, go ahead.
Make your minds up quick
'cause the real cops'll be here
On the floor.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
What are you trying to pull?
I had right left switched.
It's gonna open.
You'll live.
Left 26.
Captain Wolf,
what the hell happened in here?
What do you think happened, huh?
We had a raid on the place go bad.
We got dead  casualties.
Get in there, will you?
- Captain Wolf, you need an ambulance.
- I need a fleet of ambulances.
Call it in, will you? I'll take
my own busted ass to the hospital.
Not bad.
If you weren't such a double-dealing
asshole, I could almost like you.
Almost. Drive.
It's a scratch.
I'm not gonna kill you, but I didn't say
I was putting you up at the Ritz.
Wolf.
What?
You heard me.
and one-thousand dollar bills.
- I wanna talk.
- No.
No, what you wanna do is calm down
we can talk like adults.
I wanna talk,
but I don't wanna talk to you.
This is Alex.
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, huh?
He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.
I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.
No, she's not. Neither am I.
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?
A disc.
Names, money trails.
When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,
In exchange, Danny looked the other way
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation
were funnelled
into their private accounts.
Amazing what people
let you get away with
when they're scared
and wanna feel protected.
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there
waiting to take advantage of it.
- Like you didn't?
- I quit.
Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process
rest a whole lot easier.
You thought you could atone
by climbing into a cage
and allowing yourself
to get beaten to a pulp?
I'm getting paid for services rendered.
Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese
so they can blackmail our old honchos,
take the 30 mill and waltz off
with Danny to a villa in the Bahamas.
Bali, but whatever, right?
So, now you know. Now what?
- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.
- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.
We go to your location, you go to ours.
When we've gotten the
we will explain the code
and you'll get the cash.
That's the deal.
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.
You'll want to write it down.
Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?
You might wanna close your eyes.
Have it your way.
Come on, Luke.
You're a friend of Luke?
Not as far as you're concerned.
The violence
that has rocked the city tonight
in a Chinatown nightclub
less than an hour ago.
- This is really getting out of hand.
- You think?
Thanks for that insight.
Your Honour,
Alex Rosen's on your private line.
He says that it's urgent.
-  Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.
The disc.
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.
I'm going to meet Alex.
First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you
but make you spend
the rest of your life wishing I had.
Satisfied?
I wanna make sure
it's not ABBA's Greatest
Alex will kill you, you know.
Yeah, probably.
Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.
Other than that, I feel great.
You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?
They were all assholes, though, right?
Let her go, Alex.
Danny called.
He told me about your visit.
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.
You had the disc and the money.
What...
What is she to you?
Life.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.
The money, Luke.
In the car.
Or in the bank.
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.
You all right, Mei?
I saw him fight before.
Bad business for you.
Yeah. The worst.
You saved me, again.
We save each other.
-
- I know how you feel.
Help me get this sack of garbage
out of the car.
Make sure he gets to his daddy
safe and sound.
Might not  like much, but at least
you're gonna live to enjoy it.
You want him safe and sound
after what he did to you?
For her sake.
We meet again, all bets are off.
- Watch where you're fucking going, man!
- Keep walking.
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.
This is fucking New York City!
- Bank number five. How many more?
- That's it.
Got copies of the disc
in security boxes all over the city.
Anything happens to us,
a lot of important people
are gonna be very sorry.
Our security. Good business for us.
- What now?
- Now we get out of town.
Mei, you're a kid and...
I'm not sure I could be a good father.
I think that ship has sailed.
I don't want no more fathers.
Will you be my friend?
Till my dying day...
I got info on a school
for gifted kids up in Seattle.
It's a nice drive,
if you like trees and shit.
One day at a time, Mei.
One day at a time.
