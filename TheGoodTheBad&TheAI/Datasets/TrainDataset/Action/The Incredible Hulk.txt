Is it ready?
Hey! That's a great punch.
Fear no good.
So emotion and controI.
Breathe. Breathe.
Wait.
Okay.
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...
Okay. Okay.
Shut that off! Turn it off!
Watch out!
Okay!
That's not right.
Oh, you.
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.
Damn it!
SPARR: Here's something
a bit more interesting.
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.
Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.
Wow.
-Where was it bottled?
-Porto Verde, BraziI.
Have our people Iook for a white man
at the bottling plant.
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.
And I pulled you one ace.
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.
And on Ioan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.
GENERAL: I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help. Just make it good.
SPARR: This is the target and the Iocation.
Snatch and grab, Iive capture.
You'Il have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,
but Iive fire is for backup only.
We got Iocal out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government
who stole military secrets.
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!
Tranq him and bring him back.
Oh, come on.
Camera.
Here we go.
Get rid of the damn dog.
Take him!
Target's on the move.
Where is he?
He's on the ground.
-Let's go!
-COMMANDO: Go!
Move, move!
Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
COMMANDO: Clear everyone out!
Do not Iose him!
Oh! No!
Get around behind him!
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.
Oh, no.
You got to be kidding me.
-GENERAL ON RADIO: Where is he?
-Target acquired.
MAN: Gringo!
Let's go.
No!
BRUCE: Please! No!
Not the computer!
Gimme that! No!
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.
Oh, no.
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!
Anybody else seeing this?
COMMANDO 1 : We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!
Do it now!
Go Iive! Go Iive! Go Iive!
COMMANDO 1 : Move!
COMMANDO 2: Get out of the way!
No!
COMMANDO 2: It's behind us! Move! Move!
COMMANDO 1 : Get him!
Shoot!
HULK: Leave me alone.
No! No!
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.
He had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?
She is no Ionger a factor.
We closed that door to him a Iong time ago.
He's alone.
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Forgive me, sir?
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...
He didn't Iose us.
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.
And then something hit us, something...
Something big hit us!
It threw a forklift truck Iike it was a softbalI!
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is,
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat
-and I'm gonna...
-That was Banner.
It
was Banner.
-You have to explain that statement, sir.
-No, I don't.
You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.
Wait.
Please.
Where am I?
BLONSKY: I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone didn't Iet us know
what we were walking into.
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?
I mean, that's the job.
But this?
This is a whole new Ievel of weird.
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him,
l want in.
And, with respect, you should be Iooking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,
because if that thing shows up again,
you're gonna have a Iot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.
Sir.
Tienes mas stretchy?
Yeah. Perfecto.
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an
lnfantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWll, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.
We were tryin' to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him
what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?
-No.
-But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
-So why did he run?
-He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
-Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
-39.
-lt takes a toll, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.
No, I'm a fighter.
I'Il be one for as Iong as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone
l wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange
something Iike that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word,
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.
-Have you talked to her?
-No.
She doesn't know that I'm here.
-She's with somebody?
-Yeah, he's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.
Good. That's good.
-Bruce, what can I do to help you?
-l could use a bed for a few nights.
-You can have the spare room upstairs.
-That'd be so great.
There is one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, paI. I got a delivery on five.
I don't think there's anybody up there.
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to Iet me try.
I'Il tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.
-You are the man.
-God bless you, brother.
All right.
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
I got nothing but marinara now.
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again,
of course.
Stan?
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
l mean, where were you?
"l can't... I don't know
where you were, CeciI."
And he goes, "Not where you been at."
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awfuI.
Bruce?
Betty? What's going on?
Betty...
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
-l don't know what to say.
-Please, just tell me the truth.
BETTY: Don't go. Don't go.
I want you to come with me now.
Please. Come with me.
Please.
BETTY: It's our data.
I got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.
-Does the General know that you have this?
-No, I don't think so.
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
You have to be sure.
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-l thought you might want to...
-Thanks.
Listen, I should Ieave early,
as early as I can.
Really? You can't stay at alI?
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.
-lf I could borrow some cash...
-Of course.
I need to take a bus.
Well, at Ieast Iet me walk you to the station.
Okay.
-You have everything you need?
-Yeah.
I...
What?
-Good night.
-Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very Iow dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect,
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
You'Il get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
Is everything okay?
I think so.
Come here.
-l just wanna do this.
-Oh.
-lt's better Iike that.
-Yeah?
It feels too tight, huh?
-Yeah, a Iittle.
-Okay.
-What?
-They're here.
-Betty, Iook at me, Iook at me!
-Bruce!
You have to go far away
from me as you can!
-Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
-Bruce!
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.
I wanna know who jumped the gun.
He's heading 2-7-0.
Blonsky! Not yet!
Sir.
Look alive. This could get interesting.
I got him!
Stop! Stop!
I know you're in there!
General, please!
Sir?
Dad!
-Dad, please don't do this.
-You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.
There he is!
SOLDIER 1 ON RADIO:
Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!
SOLDIER 2: He's Iocked in.
Put two canisters in there with him.
SOLDIER: Fire!
Get her back here!
Now she'Il see.
Alpha team?
Let him have all of it.
SOLDIER 2: Come on, Iight him up!
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!
Oh, my God!
Blonsky, now you're up!
Sir?
Cover me.
Remember me?
My God, he's doing it.
Move him toward the cannons!
SOLDIER: Move!
Hold your position!
BLONSKY: Do it now!
Please, please, please, no!
-Please, please, please!
-Get her back!
You're killing him!
BETTY: Stop! Get off of me!
BETTY: Stop! Get offofme!
