- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.
- Closing time, James! Last call!
- Buy me a pint.
This is Colonel Ourumov!
Come out with your hands up!
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.
- Finish the job, James! Blow them to hell!
- You have ten seconds.
- three, two...
- For England, James!
This is your last chance!
Come out with your hands...
But a bitter kiss
will bring him to his knees
See him move
through smoke and mirrors
Howl watched you
from the shadows as a child
How it feels
to get so close and be denied
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...
- Who's that?
- The next girl.
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...
- Engine?
- Ego.
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?
- Really?
- Stop this car at once!
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Trés heureux de vous revoir.
- Bonsoir, Pierre. Ca va bien?
- Trés bien. Et vous?
- No players?
- {Bond} Banco.
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.
- Six. Madame loses.
- Buliatchl
- Enjoy it... while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.
_ Qnatopp?
- OnatOPP-
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Mm! Very good, Mr Bond.
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".
Oh. And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?
Identiﬁcation conﬁrmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet ﬁghter pilot.
Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St Petersburg.
Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.
M authorises you
to observe Miss Onatopp,
but stipulates no... contact
without prior approval.
Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay... "onatopp" of things
- {admiral cries out in pain}
- {bone cracks}
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battleﬁeld:
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.
Shh. I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.
- {captain} Please welcome the pilots.
- {applause}
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant Frangois Brouse.
- Select Mir.
- {bleep}
- Orthographic projection.
- {bleep}
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.
- Boris!
- What?
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.
- {bleeping}
- Yes! I'm in.
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.
- Spiked them!
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.
- It's not in front of me?
- Mm-mm.
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.
We are going to test-ﬁre GoldenEye.
Report your status.
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.
- Check it.
- {cocks firearm}
' {man groans}
- {alarm}
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.
- Good evening, O07.
- Tanner. What's up?
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.
We suspected it might be
the ground station
for a secret space-based
weapon called Go|denEye, but...
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.
We have another,
coming into range... now.
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.
- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.
At least one person
probably knows who it is.
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.
- Ice?
- Yes.
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".
Our political analysts say
he doesn't ﬁt the profile of a traitor.
Are these the same analysts who said
that Go|denEye couldn't exist?
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,
obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.
- Point taken.
- Not quite, O07.
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.
Merely your assurance that
there are no other Go|denEyes.
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.
Need I remind you, O07, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.
- Yes.
- Good.
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.
I see. And what if I need
additional support?
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.
- After you.
- Thank you.
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.
- Close enough for government work?
- No.
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.
- "Ml-iffy"?
- Third wife.
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.
{announcement in Russian
over PA system}
{PA system} St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?
24 for the American school,
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?
- {Bond} Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.
- {screams}
- Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.
- Lucky me.
- I think not.
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?
So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.
Kirov‘s funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.
You know your history.
At the end of the war,
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.
- {Bond gasps for breath}
- {Xenia shrieks with pleasure}
- This is it?
- Yes.
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?
- Why?
- {laughs}
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,
only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew
007's loyalty was always
to the mission,
- {woman} Wake up! Mister!
- {electronic bleeps}
- Do something! Get us out of here!
- I'm a little tied up!
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?
Your watch has. Frozen
by the Golden Eye blast.
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.
- But I don't know anything!
- Then start with what you do know.
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.
- There was no one else?
- No.
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.
- Where is the Golden Eye?
- I assumed you had it.
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.
He killed everyone,
then stole the Go|denEye.
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.
- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech!
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?
- Do you?
- Guard!
murdered by
British agent James Bond,
{Ourumov} Spread out!
Cover the other side!
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.
You know, James and I
shared everything.
- Svinya!
' {bleeping}
- Full speed!
- Shto?
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.
Ourumov... what has
this Cossack promised you?
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you! Just like everyone else.
- ls this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours,
you and I will have
more money than God
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service,
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.
- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!
- Yes, sir.
I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?
Boris' password. He plays word games
"What I sit on but don't take with me."
- Chair.
- Like I said...
{Natalya} He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!
- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.
So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.
Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?
_ Q_
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.
Uh... lam not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.
- Head to toe.
- Right...
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football ﬁeld, huh? Doesn't exist.
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.
- He knows you're comin'.
- {starts engine}
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.
- ls the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.
- I am not ready.
- Do it.
- Mischa is on-line.
- {guard} Sir!
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,
just seconds before
you set off the Go|denEye,
which erases any record
of the transactions.
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.
You always did have
a small mind, James.
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.
Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- {Boris} Natalya!
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die!
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.
She doesn't even have access
to the ﬁring codes.
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in... 12 minutes.
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.
- {Alec} Deal with it!
- She changed the access codes!
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!
- How long?
- Two minutes.
- One minute.
- Guard!
- I'm ﬁxing it.
- If he moves, kill him.
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo, hm?
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?
