Not bad.
But not good enough to live.
Mind if I sit down?
I don't have your energy.
Fight with your head.
Not your heart.
Straight.
Better, Einon.
But you're still dead.
Purpose, not passion.
No one ever found victory
in the dirt.
The peasants are revolting.
They've always been revoltin', Prince.
But now they're rebellin'.
King Freyne wants his son
to witness his noble victory.
There's nothing noble
about crushing desperate men.
They're traitorous scum!
The king commands!
Bring him!
You can come, too, nursemaid.
Die, you dog!
- I wish we were down there.
- No, you don't.
Yes, I do. Just to see you
in action, Bowen.
Yours would be
the finest blade on the field.
My blade was not made
for your father's slaughter.
He is my father, Bowen,
and he is the king.
Yes.
But when you are king,
remember today...
and the difference
between battle and butchery.
And remember the Old Code.
Then you'll be a greater king
than your father.
I promise, Knight...
I will be greater.
Freyne!
Now, Hewe, now!
- He's trapped!
- Einon!
Einon!
Einon, no!
Enough! Enough!
The battle's out there!
Father?
Die! It's mine!
Einon! Einon!
I'm here, Einon!
I'm here, my King.
Dead, madam.
King Freyne,
your husband, slain.
In here!
In here, on the bed.
Get out! Out!
Out! Brok, out!
You stay, Bowen.
Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.
There's nothing to forgive.
His father's tyranny
brought him to this end.
He's beyond all help.
Not all.
A knight is sworn to valor.
Sworn to valor.
- His heart knows only virtue.
- Virtue.
His blade defends the helpless.
His might upholds the weak.
You must stay awake, my son!
- You must stay awake. Repeat the Code.
- The Code.
His might upholds the weak.
H-His word speaks only truth.
His wrath--
Undoes the wicked.
Brok, stay there.
Lord! Great one!
Your song is sad!
Are the stars shining tonight?
No. No bright souls
glitter in this darkness.
Leave us. Go.
Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.
Whose people loved your kind
and called you friend.
Ah, the king's son...
cruel and full of trickery.
- Is this why you've come,
dragonslayer's wife?
- Dragonslayer's widow!
This boy is not his father.
This knight here is his mentor.
He has taught him the Old Code.
I need your help.
The wound is deep.
You know what you ask.
I will teach him your ways.
He will grow in your grace.
He will grow just and good.
I swear.
No! The boy must swear.
Give me your sword, Knight.
Your sword!
Do not be afraid.
He can save you.
Now listen to me, boy.
Swear that your father's
blood lust and tyranny died with him.
Swear that you will live
and rule with mercy.
Come to me
and learn the Once-ways.
Now swear!
I swear.
He's dead!
Peace, Knight of the Old Code.
Witness the wonders
of an ancient glory.
Half my heart
to make you whole.
Its strength
to purify your weakness.
Live, and remember your oath.
I served the father only
for the sake of the son.
All my hopes rest on him.
Forgive a doubting fool.
Call when you need of me.
Ask what you will of me.
My sword, my service are yours.
Only remind him
always of his vow...
Knight of the Old Code.
Brok.
Your Majesty?
The Romans built
this great fortress.
I will rebuild it,
and mine will be greater.
It will take many men, my Lord,
to rebuild this ruin.
Yes.
Yes, it will.
Not so rebellious now.
You should thank me, boy.
It was my stroke made you king.
No, Brok, I want no martyrs.
Death should be a release,
not a punishment.
Look good, dog.
I'm the last thing
you'll ever see.
Burn the insolence
out of his eyes.
No! No!
Not my eyes! No!
Father!
Run!
How dare you defy me!
Einon, you're unwell.
You've been bewitched.
Look at this!
It's madness!
- Remember the Code!
- The king is above the Code!
Have you forgotten
everything I taught you?
No one is above the Code...
especially the king.
Dragon, I loved that boy,
and you changed him!
You tricked me, Dragon!
No matter where you fly...
no matter where you go,
I will find you!
Today I make a new vow!
I will spend the rest of my life
hunting you down!
Avalon, oh, Avalon.
For you I quest each day...
the resting place of Arthur...
and the Old Code of his way.
And when I find
those holy stones...
I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray.
Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon...
think me not a fool.
My quest is not for vanity,
my quest is spiritual.
Spiritual!
Merlin, spiritual!
Whoa! Merlin!
Merlin! Ow!
Everyone's a critic!
- Dragon, dragon.
- Yes, I know. Where?
There, there.
Get back here, horse.
You coward.
Marvelous! Heroics befitting the days
of Arthur and the Round Table!
Never have I seen such skill!
Then you must have lived
the sheltered life...
of a mon-- monk.
Why, yes. A scribe, scholar,
historian and poet.
Your servant, sir,
Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.
My humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess...
your dauntless courage,
and your superb, swift sword.
You have the poet's gift
of exaggeration.
Sir, you should read
my histories.
But you belittle your talent.
Modesty as well as valor.
The Code of ancient Camelot
still lives.
Hardly worthy of Camelot.
Still, it's one less dragon.
Well done, Knight!
Congratulations.
Our gratitude,
mine and King Einon's.
Uh, you can keep your gratitude.
I'll take the gold.
- Yours or the king's.
- Gold, Knight?
We made a bargain, remember?
One dragon put down, one bag of gold.
Your honor has a price,
Sir Knight?
It has expenses.
Honor won't feed my belly
nor shoe my horse.
The priest is right.
It is your duty to protect King Einon's
vassals as a knight of the realm.
Not of this realm.
I bend no knee to Einon.
I should have known.
Foreign riffraff!
Well, begone, vagabond,
before I arrest you!
Back to work, you scum!
If King Einon's wheat
isn't cut before the rain...
I'll do a little cutting
of my own!
Sir Knight!
Sir Knight, wait!
Sir Knight!
Hear me out!
I'm on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?
The road's still free,
unless Einon's taxed it.
A road tax, King Einon. Hmm?
A road tax.
They are your roads, after all.
People really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them.
- And those that can't pay
will have to work it off.
- lngenious, Felton.
Only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat.
That's very good, "bad hat."
Out of my way, peacock.
Brok, some are good at hunting men,
some are good at hunting money.
Both have value for me.
Kara?
Kara, I told you--
- I told you not to come here anymore.
- I'm a disobedient child.
Go on. Take a drink. Go on.
Magnificent shot, Your Highness!
- Care to double the wager?
- Ah, yes, happily.
Shall we say the water bucket?
Stand still. Stand still.
Superb!
Double again?
Double again. Why not?
I say.
A moving target.
Peasant scum.
You've got a nerve,
interfering with the king's sport!
There's no sport
in tormenting a sick, old man.
I beg Your Majesty,
let him go.
It's been 12 years.
Your castle is built.
He can do you no more harm.
For God's sake, release him.
Father!
I've always said death is a release,
not a punishment.
Go.
Kara.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
I've decided to compose
"The Ballad of Bowen"!
- How do you prefer I should write this?
- Far away!
Oh, don't concern yourself
with my safety!
I mean verse, meter.
Shall I spice it up
with a poetical flourish...
or just the cold, hard facts?
If you do not be quiet...
you and I shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here.
I mean, it's all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons.
But if a dragon falls in the
forest and nobody gets to hear
about it, does it make a thud?
- Brother Gilbert.
- What?
The quill is mightier than the s--
Ooh.
The quill is mightier than the--
That's all that's left
of the last dragonslayer...
who tangled with me!
If I were you,
I'd quit while I was ahead.
Is that the best you can do?
Catch!
You know, I've got quite
a collection of victims in here.
I won't be added to it!
I've given you
my final warning.
Into the mouth of death he strode.
Into the gringy gloom.
Into the pit of fear unknown...
perhaps to court his doom.
That was good.
What did I say?
What did I say?
A little damp for fire,
isn't it?
Why must you knight-errands
out to make a name for yourselves...
always pick on us dragons?
I don't need a name!
And I have a collection of my own!
Yeah? You're one
who kills dragons for money.
It's honest enough work.
One must earn a living.
Oh, yes, one must live.
Well, since you seek a profit,
we might as well begin.
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
It's not the profit.
It's the pleasure.
Perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think!
Bowen! Bowen, take care!
He went that way!
Take care, Bowen!
You can't fly forever!
- Neither can you!
- Slow down!
Come, visit the woods!
Whoa!
Look out! Well done!
- Ow!
- Pity. That must have hurt.
- Yeah!
- Again?
- Ow!
- And again?
How do you like the ride so far?
We're earning our money now,
aren't we?
Now, is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off?
Yikes!
The sword against the fang and claw.
The flame against the shield.
Blah, blah, blah,
which one would win?
Blah, blah,
field, shield, wield.
Whose flesh from bones
be peeled. Oh, no.
Whose fate would soon be sealed.
Whose fate would soon be sealed?
Whose fate would soon be sealed!
Oh, you're good. Haven't had
this sort of challenge in some time.
Nor likely to again!
Drat!
A little overconfident, aren't we?
Hardly. But if you win,
you'll be out of work.
I will not stop until I've rid the world
of every last one of you.
I am the last one!
You're just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks.
Haven't you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days?
I got me one just the other day.
So it was you who killed the
Scarred One. She and I were the last.
Must've been a proud kill, warrior.
How much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse?
That's none of your business.
Couldn't have been very much.
And you'll kill me for sport?
And when there are
no more dragons to slay...
how will you make
a living, Knight?
Shut up!
Whoa!
If your teeth come down, my sword
goes up, right into your brain!
If your sword goes up,
my teeth come down!
Into the moonlit night
the titans dueled...
in mortal combat bound.
Oh, who'd the fatal
false step make?
Whose blood
would stain the ground?
Oh, good Lord.
Sir Eglamore.
Oh, thank you very much.
It's been stuck down there
for months.
Can you get your buttocks
off my tongue?
Why should you
be comfortable?
My armor is rusting in your drool,
and your breath is absolutely foul.
Well, what do you expect...
with old knights
rotting between my molars?
Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.
No, no, no, stop!
No, stop!
Sorry about that.
It seems we're in a bit
of a stalemate, wouldn't you say?
Yuck! But I can go
three days without sleep.
I can go three weeks.
Ooh! I'll stab you
before I nod off.
And I'll chomp you.
Marvelous, we'll kill each other.
- What do you suggest?
- A truce.
Get out of my mouth
and let's talk face-to-face.
How do I know I can trust you?
I give you my word.
The word of a dragon.
It's worthless.
Stubborn lout!
I should have known!
Go on. Kill me!
I don't want to kill you!
I never did!
And I don't want you to kill me!
How do we gain?
If you win, you lose a trade.
If I win, I wait around
for the next sword slinger...
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide.
And I'm tired of lurking in holes...
and skulking in darkness.
I'm gonna let you up now.
And if you insist...
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity.
Or you can listen
to my alternative.
Hmm?
What's the alternative?
Father, Father, look!
Dragon!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Pesky critters, dragons.
You!
Like big rats.
You never seem to get rid of them.
Unless you pay me
two bags of gold, in advance.
Come on, Dragon.
Come on, Dragon.
Yes!
Ow!
Hmm.
Hello.
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.
Most profitable, Dragon.
I should have met you a long time ago.
There is much gold in the world.
Perhaps when you've had your fill of it,
you'll no longer need me.
I am a Knight of the Old Code.
My word is my bond.
- No compunctions then?
- About what?
Well, such deception hardly befits
a Knight of the Old Code.
Fleecing Einon's lackeys.
That's a service to mankind.
Is it?
When you squeeze the nobility,
it's the peasants who feel the pinch.
That's not my concern.
Why should I stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own?
Don't clutter up
a clever scheme with morality.
Mmm, so be it...
Knight of the Old Code.
If I wanted my conscience pricked,
I would have stayed with the priest!
Huh! And what does a dragon
know of the Old Code, anyway?
His blade defends the helpless.
His might upholds the weak.
His word speaks only truth.
Shut up! I remember.
That's all it is, a memory.
Nothing can bring it back.
You sound like one who tried.
And failed.
So I no longer try to change the world,
Dragon. I just try to get by in it.
Yes, it's better than death,
I suppose.
Oh, is it? I should think
you'd welcome death.
You know, the last of your kind,
all your friends dead,
hunted wherever you go.
Do you delight in reminding me?
Yes, Knight,
I do long for death.
But fear it.
Why? Aside from your misery,
what's to lose?
My soul.
Finish him, Brok!
Well, are you a man?
Should he continue, Mother?
Oh, the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.
The quarry!
First you beg mercy
for your father's fate.
Then you try to avenge it.
Now, you'll share it.
In your kingdom, Einon,
there are worse fates than death.
I'll think one up for you.
- Take her away.
- No! No!
He killed my father!
He killed my father!
He killed my father!
I remember you now.
I remember you.
Your hair, like fire.
You gave me this scar.
Didn't you?
I... owe... you.
I can, uh--
I really can.
Sorry, Bowen.
I hope you like it well done.
You must have hated us very much.
I hated one of you.
These I killed because I wanted
to kill him. But I never found him.
I never will.
If you're the last, he must be dead.
Oh, yes.
Tell me, what was he like...
this, uh, dragon
that you hated?
He only had half a heart.
But even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy.
Einon was no innocent!
He polluted the heart!
How do you know that?
How do you know that, Dragon?
All dragons know that story.
What was to be their hope
became their doom.
A spoiled, ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it!
No! I knew Einon.
I was his teacher.
I taught him
the ways of honor, of right.
Then he betrayed you...
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke.
That's a lie, Dragon!
Stop calling me "Dragon"!
I have a name.
Well, what is it?
You couldn't possibly pronounce it
in your tongue.
- Try me.
- It's--
Next time stab more flesh,
less cloth.
I'll pierce your heart!
You already did.
A very special heart,
like no other.
A black, withered thing
without pity.
Then teach me.
Pity me.
I'll give you everything.
Even power.
You're so beautiful.
Even power.
Even a throne.
Oh, dear.
Thank you.
It's passed now.
What was it?
An old complaint
that acts up now and again.
Forgive me if anything
I said, if I upset you.
It wasn't you, not you.
Don't be afraid.
I won't let you suffer
the same fate as me.
I've come to help you.
This will bring you out
well below the castle walls.
Thank--
You.
Have you been watching over me
all night?
I've been thinking.
Yes? About what?
Many things.
Mostly about what to call you.
I think I've found you a name.
You say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky.
I did.
Up there.
Do you see that group of stars?
I know those stars very well.
- Do you see the shape that they make?
- Mm-hmm, a dragon.
Yes.
They call it "Draco."
It means "dragon"
in the scholars' speech.
So instead of calling me
"Dragon" in your tongue...
you'll call me "Dragon"
in some other tongue.
You're right.
It's silly.
No. No, I would be honored
to be named after those stars.
I-- I truly would.
Thank you, Bowen.
Draco.
Throw off the yoke
of Einon's oppression!
We must start to fight back!
Your father sang that sour tune once,
and we did fight back.
And once was enough!
We'll not dance to it again!
No, Hewe, just cringe
like a dog under Einon's boot.
At least a cringing dog's
a live one!
Hey! Why waste good food
on bad rhetoric?
I speak the truth.
Truth?
It's rarely inspiring, lass.
And it never wins rebellions...
but it will stretch necks,
if there is a neck...
underneath that little mud pie.
Ready or not, here I come!
Dragon!
It's Draco!
About time.
Mmm!
It seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer.
Where is the lord responsible
for this village?
Brok lives in a big house
about six miles away.
But he'll only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it.
I won't pluck them as deeply.
I'll make you a fair offer.
Take it, or leave him!
It's enough you people
grovel to Einon.
Will you be bullied by some broken-down,
blackmailing knight as well?
That's right, you don't need me.
Settle it yourself.
Of course, there are other ways.
Perhaps you'll part with...
one of your precious daughters,
instead of gold.
Dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices, I hear.
