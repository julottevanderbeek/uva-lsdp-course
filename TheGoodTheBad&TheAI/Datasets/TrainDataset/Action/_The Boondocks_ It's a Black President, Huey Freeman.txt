Towards the end of the 2008
campaign, the republican party,
terrified at their own sinking
poll numbers, attempted to link
Barack Obama to radical leftist
figures to make him appear
UN-American.
First was the controversial
reverend Jeremiah Wright.
I say mother  America!
America's mother!
America's daddy!
America can eat a dick!
America can lick the balls!
When that failed, Republicans
tried linking Obama with
Huey Freeman after discovering
the two were MySpace friends.
Did they leave each
other glitter comments?
The public has a right to know.
Okay, this is a little boy who
thinks that Jesus is black,
Ronald Reagan is the devil, and
the government is lying about
Kids like this need to be on
America's  List, not our
friend list.
Obama did his best to
downplay the relationship.
Look, I have many, many
friends on MySpace.
I-I pretty much add anybody.
I don't know who this Huey
Freeman is, but he doesn't
stand for what I stand for, and
I denounce, I repudiate, and
condemn him.
Basically  Him.
* I am the stone that
the builder refused *
* I am the visual, the
inspiration that made lady sing
the blues *
* I'm the spark that
makes your idea bright *
* the same spark that
lights the dark *
* so that you can know your
left from your right *
* I am the ballot in your box,
the bullet in the gun *
* the inner glow that lets you
know to call your brother son *
* the story that just begun *
* the promise of what's to come *
* and I'ma remain a soldier
till the war is won *
I tracked down the
notoriously reclusive
Huey Freeman here, where he
lives with his grandfather and
younger brother.
The first thing I notice about
Huey is his incredibly large
hair.
The second thing I notice
is his permanent scowl.
How does it feel to be labeled
a domestic terrorist?
Huey: Eh, I'm retired.
So, then, now that it looks like
Obama is going to win, as a
black African-American Negro,
are you merely excited, or are
everything is going to change forever?
Huey: Eh.
I felt my sphincter clinch and
my scrotum contract in shock
at his response.
Granddad: I swear that boy
just likes to be miserable.
He can't enjoy nothing.
All he wanna talk about is the
build-a-bear group, the federal
reserve, and all that bull
I don't know where he get that from.
He didn't get it from me.
I believe in hope and change.
Nobody knows exactly how old
Robert Freeman is, not even
Robert Freeman himself, but his
age is estimated somewhere
between 80 and 120 years old.
Granddad: This is what me and
my generation -- but mostly
me -- struggled for, sacrificed
for -- you can say personally,
individually, paved the way for.
The dogs were after us, so I
took off my belt and started
whipping on the dogs.
Then I started running.
Then I looked behind me.
Jesse Jackson was supposed to be
there, but he had jumped into a
dumpster, hiding.
That punk ass.
I find it difficult to
determine whether Robert is a
pathological liar or suffering
the early stages of dementia.
So, if the election is fake,
then what's really going on?
Huey: The end of America.
I felt despair so terrible, I
briefly considered slitting my
own wrists or bludgeoning myself
about the head with a steel pipe
or baseball bat, but I brought
no blade, no pipe, no bat.
Describe Riley Freeman in one word.
Riley: Mm, I'd say "real nigga."
"Real nigga" is two words.
Riley: I know it's two words, nigga!
Real niggas don't follow instructions.
This is Robert Freeman's
other grandson, Riley.
He's empowered by the prospect
of a black president, not in the
way society would hope or expect.
Riley: Oh, if my nigga Obama
gets up in there, wssh, I'ma act
a fool!
I ain't doing no more
homework, nothin'.
We taking over.
Come on, what's a cop gonna do to me?
I'ma be like, "don't make me
call the president, bitch!"
And the cop's -- he gonna be
like, "oh, snap, Riley, a real
nigga -- the president's a real nigga.
"We can't do nothing!"
I can't wait.
* I got way too many
cars in my driveway *
* I got boats, I got planes *
* nigga, I'm paid *
this is Otis Jenkins, but in
the United States, he's better
known by his rap moniker
"thugnificent," a combination of
the words "thug"
and "magnificent."
Otis has found success like many
Negro American entertainers
today by being a professional buffoon.
Are you supporting Barack Obama?
For what?
For president.
President of what?
You don't know there's a black
man running for president
named Barack Obama?
His name is Barack, for real?
Barack Obama, yes.
Get the  Out of here.
Barack?
Yes, barack.
Where's he from -- Africa?
His dad was African, yes.
You can't be serious, man.
There ain't no nigga running for
president named barack Obama.
No  Way, man.
No  Way!
I don't believe you.
Stop  With me.
Tom: If he wins, I think it
will literally be the best day
of my life.
Tom and Sarah Dubois are also
neighbors of the Freemans.
They both work on the Obama campaign.
Sarah: Barack has...
Already changed our lives in so many ways.
How?
Sarah: Well, I mean, it's no
secret that me and Tom have had
some problems in the past
with our relationship...
Tom: Well, it's not like
the whole world knew.
Sarah: ...But I think ever
since we started working
together for barack...
Tom: Things are totally different now.
Sarah: Much better, and
it's all thanks to barack.
He is such a wonderful, wonderful man.
I just think it's about time we
had a president who was smart
and tall and charming
and strong and fit.
Tom: Just like your hubby?
Sarah:
This isn't about you, sweetie.
It is always obvious when a
couple hasn't engaged in normal
marital relations for some time.
Obama, of course, is as polarizing
as he is transformative.
Some have accused Obama
of being a socialist.
Others believe that he's a Muslim.
Some have gone as far as to
label him the anti-Christ.
Ruckus: He is the socialist
Muslim anti-Christ!
This is Uncle ruckus.
He's an Uncle Tom, perhaps the
biggest Uncle Tom to have ever
lived.
Ruckus: If this nigga gets elected,
America is over -- over!
You want this nigga to
In the same place
William Taft ?!
And his big wife -- she don't
need to be in the white house.
She should be in the wnba,
shooting foul shots.
Unh. You want my brick, you
gonna have to pry it from my
cold, dead hands, Mr.
Obama Hussein!
Nigga down!
What is wrong with
letting people be happy?
Can too much hope
possibly be a bad thing?
Huey: Hope is irrational.
In Bavaria, we have a saying,
"Der Junge ist ja total bedient."
It means, "this is the most
depressing  Kid I've ever
"met in my life."
I sit down once again with
thugnificent, who appears to
have undergone a political
awakening since our last
conversation.
So, you know who Obama is now?
Oh, no, I knew who the nigga
was -- I was just joking.
You were not joking.
You jumped on the Obama
celebrity bandwagon because it
will give you much needed exposure.
No, see, it ain't got
nothing to do with that.
You know what I'm saying?
I started looking into his
political positions and his --
and his -- and his policies
and views and whatnot.
What policies?
Well, you know, I heard the
nigga speak, right, and how he
was talking about changing some
Or hoping for some
And I thought, yeah, I mean, you
know, all the nigga's asking for
is hope.
You can sit on your
ass all day and hope.
If you're too lazy to hope,
you is a lazy
That's all I know.
Granddad: I'm voting for Obama
because he's gonna lower
my taxes.
Actually, he has promised to raise
taxes at your income level.
Granddad: Huh?
Sarah: And he's just really, really fit...
To lead --
and, also, body fit, too.
Granddad: Well, I also
support Obama because he's
against corporate bailouts.
That is also not true.
Granddad: Huh?
Riley: I'm supporting Obama because...
He black.
Granddad: And he's gonna get
the troops out of Afghanistan,
right?
Also wrong.
Granddad: Then what the
That nigga gonna do?!
I mean, we all need to, you know,
do some  Sometimes.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Some  Needs to get done.
And until we do that
Ain't gonna change.
So I thought to myself,
"let's do this "
And that's when will. I.
Am called me about doing this damn song.
Thugnificent joins will. I.
Am's all-star celebrity
tribute to barack Obama.
* got up this morning *
* things weren't working right *
* I said I want to make a change *
* I said I wanna fight *
* Obama walked up and
said, "yes, we can" *
* I said, "I want to ride your
nuts 'cause I think you're the
man *
* and now I'm dick-riding *
* Obama, Obama *
* now I'm dick-riding *
* Obama, Obama *
* now I'm dick-riding *
* Obama, Obama *
* now I'm dick-riding,
riding, riding *
* dick-riding for tomorrow *
* dick-riding for today *
* dick-riding for the straight *
* dick-riding for the gay *
* dick-riding for America *
* dick-riding for Iraq *
* it's okay to ride that dick,
just as long as it's Barack's *
* and now we're dick-riding *
* Obama, Obama *
it is finally election night.
Robert Freeman is throwing a party.
Granddad: Well, it's been a
long black struggle, and I felt
me and barack deserved a party.
All around the room, I see black
faces beaming with elation.
It is as though each of them
has been elected president...
Almost each of them.
Huey:
Ruckus: What's wrong with you?
I thought you'd be dancing on
your tail with the rest of the
circus chimps.
Look at 'em -- just as
happy as a pig in
Can't they see?
Can't they see what this nigga's
gonna do to our great country?!
Looks like we the only two
people with sense in this whole
room, just you and me
-- just you and me.
Granddad: Ruckus, shut up and
get back to work and grab some
more champagne!
Ruckus: See?
Niggas already getting uppity!
So I'm thinking that this
is gonna be my new look.
Riley: Oh.
That's a way to go.
I mean, I feel like it's
more grown-up, you know?
Like, having tighter clothes is
definitely gonna make people
take me more seriously.
Tom: It's really gonna happen.
It's all gonna be better now.
It's all gonna be
better, right, honey?
Sarah: Tom, I'm trying to watch this.
Tom: Mnh.
Riley: Yo, yo, yo, yo.
I heard the presidential limo
is gonna be, like, a crazy,
pimped-out Cadillac now, with
rims and, like, machine guns and
lasers.
Granddad: Excuse me!
I'd like to propose a toast.
Now, I'd just like to say that
today is a very special day for
me.
I hope you all are enjoying the
cheese, wine, and freedom I have
struggled so hard to provide tonight.
And because of my pain and
suffering, the black struggle is
officially over.
No longer can they keep us down.
No longer can we be silenced
-- Sarah: This is it!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
And now we have the returns from
the West coast coming in here.
Okay. And so, yes, folks,
we are calling it --
barack Hussein Obama will
be the next president of
the United States.
Tom: Obama! Obama!
Obama! Obama!
Sarah: Yeah, Obama!
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to be an American!
Yeah!
Ruckus:
Why, lord?!
All: * Obama! *
* o-o-Obama! *
* Obama! *
Riley: O-Ba-ma.
O-Ba-ma.
It is days before the inauguration,
and obamamania is
at a fever pitch.
I return to Woodcrest to
check on the Freemans.
Granddad: I don't necessarily
think of myself as a hero.
Uh, and when people always ask
me if I want a medal or a
monument or a statue in my
honor, I say, "no, mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
All I want to do is be there, in
person, on that glorious day,
when the first black
president "take the oath."
I just want to stand in the
crowd, somewhere in the front,
maybe in the VIP section,
maybe next to Beyoncé.
Are you aware that some
people are paying as much as
$50,000 for VIP inauguration tickets?
Granddad: Well, I don't think
you can put a price on decades
of struggle.
Did you contribute any money
at all to the Obama campaign?
Granddad: I paid 10
bucks for this t-shirt.
Did you get that from
the campaign website?
Granddad: No, I got it from
the guy at the car wash, but
it's still free advertising when
a lot of people have seen me in
this shirt.
I mean, before we change the
world, we got to change
ourselves first.
I mean, this is the new
colorless, flavorless, and
unscented era.
Like, from now on, I'm calling
all my niggas "Obamas," and all
my bitches I'm
calling "Michelles."
I mean, think about it.
If you was a bitch, right, would
you rather be called a bitch or
Michelle?
And what about bitches named Michelle?
Man, you making jokes.
I'm trying to uplift my Obamas.
* Obama walked up and
said, "yes, we can" *
granddad: Yes, can you tell the
president-elect it's civil
rights legend Robert Freeman --
f-r-e-e-m-a-n -- who struggled
to open the door for
him to be president?
You got all that?
Right. Just tell him I'm calling
again about those tickets --
again.
Hey, man, I got that Obama water.
Change the way you hydrate, brother.
Yo, little man, hey,
hey, check it out.
I got commemorative
plates, two for $20.
How many you need?
Huey: I'm cool.
Man, can you believe it?
In a few days, we're gonna
have a black president.
Aren't you excited, little man?
Huey: Eh.
"Eh"?
What's "eh" supposed to mean?
Huey: Just means "eh."
Yo, what the deal, man?
Yo, yo. What's up, man?
I asked this kid if he was
excited about Obama, and he
said, "eh."
"Eh"? He said, "eh"?
Yeah. What's wrong with you?
You're not excited?
Not excited?!
Who ain't excited?
This little nigga right here!
Why ain't he excited?
So you don't like Obama!
You want McCain to win!
Huey: I never said that.
Why ain't you like barack Obama?
He got a lovely family.
Not according to this little nigga.
He got a problem with
a black president.
Granddad: What's going on?
What did I tell you about talking
to anybody about anything?
Huey: I didn't say anything!
I ought to kick your ass!
Granddad: Hey, everybody,
just calm down.
Ruckus: Make a hole, darkies!
Just what the hell is going on here?
Granddad: Ruckus?
Huey: Oh, no.
This little big-haired
nigga hates Obama!
Ruckus: And I say good for him.
Leave this little boy alone.
He telling the truth!
Barack Obama is an evil man!
Granddad: Hey, everybody,
just calm down!
Ruckus: You heard us.
You say, "yes, we can."
We say, "no, you can't, nigga!"
Oh, hell, no!
Ruckus: Oh, ow! I can't see!
Ow!
Granddad: Run!
Ruckus: It's a monkey
stampede, race war!
Somebody, help!
Riley: Get in!
Granddad: Get in the car, quick!
Riley: Drive! Drive!
Go, granddad!
The American press struggles
to comprehend the incident.
To them, Huey is like a calf
that refuses its mother's udder,
choosing instead to drink the
bitter waters of its own making.
Here is the danger of too much
hope -- skeptics are treated
like blasphemers, and indifference
becomes equal to hate.
Robert Freeman calls a press
conference to do damage control.
Granddad: Huey Freeman is
not really my grandson.
I refute, renounce, and rebuke him.
I hope this incident in no way
affects my request for VIP
inaugural tickets and/or the
inaugural ball with Beyoncé.
Rosa parks is no longer with us,
but I consider myself to be the
next best thing -- in
many ways, better.
Where is your wife?
Tom: She's in, uh, D.C.
There was a problem or something
with the tickets, so we only had
one, and I let her have it.
Are you afraid your wife will
have lusty sex with barack Obama?
Tom: What? No!
No, that's impossible.
I didn't ask if it was possible,
only if you were afraid.
I can't help but notice you are
like a less attractive, less
wealthy, less powerful version of him.
It is quite understandable
for you to be concerned.
Celebrities, dignitaries, and
civil rights legends are
arriving in droves for the
inauguration of barack Obama.
Anyone hoping to get tickets
at this point, don't bother.
The ship has sailed, and you are
not on it because you are not
important.
Riley: Hey, granddad,
this was at the door.
Granddad: "Office of
the president-elect"?
Mr. Freeman, please find
enclosed two VIP tickets to the
inauguration, as well as the
inaugural ball with Beyoncé, as
a small token of gratitude for
all the sacrifices you've made
on behalf of me and
this great country.
I look forward to sharing
this historic day with you.
Sincerely, president-elect
barack Obama.
Granddad:
Riley: What's going on?
Granddad: I'm going
to the inauguration.
You want to come?
Both: Yeah, boy!
Granddad:
And just like that, virtually
foaming at the mouth with
unbridled excitement, Robert
and Riley leave for the
inauguration.
You are looking at the final
mission of a domestic terrorist,
operation exodus.
Convinced he has no place in
Obama's America, Huey Freeman
decides to leave the country for
good, and he has an unlikely
companion.
Ruckus: I was gonna go to the
inauguration and try to crown
Obama with a brick,
but who am I fooling?
My arm just ain't what it used to be.
Plus, that greasy
nigga is really fast.
And knowing these liberal
activist judges, they might
actually try and put
me in jail for it.
No, I think -- I think it's
time for me to leave this great
country.
Oh, I can't bear to see it run
by an African Muslim communist
anti-Christ.
I just can't!
It's just like when Nicole
brown Simpson married
that nigga o.J.
Back on February 2, 1985.
Oh, I knew it was gonna end badly.
I told 'em.
I told 'em all!
But nobody wanted to listen to
old Uncle ruckus then, neither.
I want to go someplace I'll fit
in, like Norway or Ireland.
Huey: What about the Ivory Coast?
Ruckus: Absolutely no Africa!
No way!
All them countries got nigga
presidents, which defeats the
whole purpose of leaving this country.
How do you feel being teamed
up with your archenemy?
Huey: First of all, we're not a team.
Second of all, we're not a team.
I've got gas money.
He's got the license.
We're just gonna drive to Canada
and then go our separate ways.
You see, bill, I consider
myself a black leader now, and
that means helping Obama and
doing anything he asks.
Oh, yes, I can
hear your concern for the state
of the world in that song you did
about stomping people in the
nuts.
Oh, that was the old me.
Everything is different now.
I'm much, much, much more
politically aware and stuff.
Really? Well, name the three
branches of government, then.
The what?
Come on, black leader.
It's fourth-grade social-studies time.
What are the three
branches of government?
Uh, let's see.
They got the main branch.
Uh... if you're a black leader,
I'm glad I'm a white man.
What a moron!
Huey: What's the point of
talking if nobody ever learns?
Ruckus: This is an outrage!
I have my rights!
Oh! Oh, them bricks ain't mine!
Ain't that a surprise?
Already taking away my
constitutional right to bear bricks!
Martial law!
Martial law!
Get your arms off of me!
We remain a young nation, but
in the words of scripture, the
time has come to set
aside childish things.
The time has come to reaffirm
our enduring spirit, to choose
our better history...
We demand to see him!
Granddad: No, please!
I have VIP tickets!
Granddad: Hey!
Riley: Get your hands off me.
A'ight, you in trouble now.
I'm calling my nigga obeezy.
Granddad: Please, don't tase me!
Don't tase me, bro!
I'm a old man!
I got a heart condition!
Aaaaaah!
You can't do this to me!
I'm a civil rights legend!
Aaaaaah!
Riley: Save us, Obama!
...The path for the
fainthearted...
Huey Freeman is forced to abort
operation exodus because
he cannot get a ride.
Granddad: Barack Obama?
I just found out that fool
is gonna raise my taxes.
His promises are just like
his tickets -- worthless.
Good thing I didn't
vote for his lyin' ass.
Riley: Obama ain't no real nigga.
And check this out -- I heard
he works for the feds.
That ain't a good look, barack.
Sarah: Washington was indescribable.
It was just so amazing.
And I got to meet him!
Was he everything you
dreamed he would be?
Sarah: Oh, yes, he was,
and so much more!
Oh, yeah, I'm still down for
the cause and  But I'm
like, "hey, I did my part."
You know what I'm saying?
I got the nigga elected.
You know, time to get back to
work -- you feel me? -- Doing
what thugnificent do.
Besides, them tight-ass clothes
was cutting off my circulation.
Ruckus: Due to the conditions
of my parole, I am unable to
leave the country at this time.
I am forced to remain here and
express my extreme displeasure,
while in no way threatening the
life of the president and his
beautiful monkey family.
I ask Huey Freeman if he has any final
thoughts he'd like to share.
Huey: Yeah.
I'm retired.
