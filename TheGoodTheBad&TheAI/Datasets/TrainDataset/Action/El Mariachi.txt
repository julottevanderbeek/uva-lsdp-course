Yes.
Yes.
You know what to do.
Good morning, Azul.
- Do you know who this is?
- Moco...
- It's been years. What do you want?
- I'm a few towns away...
...with a whole new gang.
I heard you were locked up nearby -
- so I decided to call, my friend.
That was nice of you, you pig!
Get me out of here
and give me my share of the money.
- I got you where you are.
- Should I really get you out?
I know you're doing business from
your cell with some loyal men, -
- a mobile phone and the protection
that prison offers.
Not a bad idea.
Maybe someday I'll give it a try.
You owe me a fortune.
In here I make peanuts.
You know it.
So help me out...my friend.
Soon, Azul. Soon.
I'm sending some friends to get you.
In a few days.
That's more like it.
Just like the Moco I used to know.
Hang in there.
I won't forget that you've been
a big part of our triumph.
What's going on, Moco?
Getting me out today?
There are three armed men.
Did you send them?
I'm still here. And so are
your friends. But not for long.
They have something they want
to scream to you. Listen close.
You'll repeat it to me
when I visit you.
That morning
was just like any other.
No love, no luck.
No ride.
No change.
I came across a turtle
on the highway.
We were both taking our time
getting to where we were going.
What I didn't know
was that my time was running out.
Free coconuts...
I was beginning to like this city.
I always wanted to be a "mariachi".
Like my father, my grandfather
and my great-grandfather.
I'm not as good as them yet,
but I'm improving.
I planned to follow their footsteps
to the end. Die with my guitar.
I played from town to town,
picking up experience.
This town was my next stop.
The free coconut
at the edge of town -
- made me feel
this place would bring good luck.
But I was wrong.
- What'll it be?
- A soda.
- A little music?
- Why?
I'm a mariachi. A good one.
I play ballads, love songs...
A few originals.
- What do I care?
- I could add class to the place.
I work for next to nothing.
I live mostly from tips.
But I need steady work.
I guarantee
you'll get more customers.
Why would I want one mariachi
when I have a whole band?
You see? I only pay one guy
and I have a whole mariachi band.
Understand?
Thanks.
If you want to earn a real living,
get yourself a real instrument.
Idiot...
What the hell is this?
Mariachi day?
There's no work for you, either.
Bartender...A beer.
In a bottle.
I'm looking for an old friend.
His name is...Moco.
- Where is he?
- Sometimes he's here.
He owns the place.
- So you know him?
- Of course, we work for him.
That's too bad...
Hold this.
What the hell is going on?
- Say something!
- Moco!
Give me the phone.
Take it.
Moco?
Dead? All of them?
How long ago?
What does he look like?
Carrying a guitar case?
Dressed in black?
Don't worry, Moco.
We'll find him, kill him,
and feed him to the dogs.
If you see someone dressed in black,
with a guitar case...
Call this number. His name is Azul.
And if I don't call,
you'll kill me, right?
I won't. He will.
I was beginning to realise
this town had no luck.
What happened to the days
when guitarists were gods?
Like my forefathers.
Technology has crushed us...
...and robbed us of our culture.
Turned us into machines.
She was the most beautiful creature
I'd seen that day.
Next to the turtle, of course.
- What can I get you?
- A soda.
Soda? Are you a little boy, or what?
I'm a musician.
I can't drink or smoke.
My voice is my life.
Cheers.
I work for next to nothing.
I live mostly off tips.
But I need steady work.
- Where?
- Here, in your bar.
No, I don't have the money
for a mariachi.
This isn't my day.
What?
Thanks.
I need a cheap room for the week.
I'm looking for work.
Can I pay you later?
Yeah, pay me later.
Thanks.
Excuse me,
but could you leave a deposit?
You don't trust me?
Sorry...
How much can you give me?
Not much.
I only have a few pesos.
That's fine. Have a nice day.
Thanks.
No, not there. Room ten.
There!
He's wearing black. Find him!
Here he is!
What happened, mariachi?
Too much soda?
I just killed four men.
Is that true?
- Wait! What's your name?
- Domino.
Wait, Domino.
It was self-defence.
I'm not from here.
I don't know anyone.
No friends...
No enemies...
- Were they thieves?
- I don't think so.
Four men.
I was staying at a cheap hotel.
Nothing of value. No money.
They just wanted to kill me.
Then why come here?
So they can kill me, too?
I need a place to stay
until this passes over.
They think I'm someone else.
I'm just a mariachi.
I've got a room up there.
Don't touch anything.
I'll be up later.
Then we'll call a friend of mine.
Thank you.
I'll never forget this.
It's over there.
Watch out for my pit bulls.
- Hello, Domino.
- What is it?
Give me the phone.
I have to call Moco.
Domino...Has anyone strange
come around here?
Strange people always come here.
- Dressed in black, guitar case?
- No.
He killed ten of our men.
All in just one day.
- Aren't you gonna call your boss?
- Give me a drink first.
Moco...He got away.
He shot at me.
And he killed several of our men.
He's bad news.
I didn't get a good look at him.
If he changes his disguise
I won't recognise him.
Don't worry.
One thing I know. He always carries
a guitar and dresses in black.
It's his thing.
But...it's not a guitar.
It's a guitar case full of weapons.
- What is it?
- It's not a guitar.
It's a case full of weapons.
He uses it on his victims.
Goodbye.
Thanks for the drink.
I'll be right back.
- I said not to touch anything.
- I was trying to relax.
- I can get out...
- No...Finish up.
- Want some shampoo?
- Yes, thanks.
- Who are you?
- I'm a musician.
What do you have there?
- Guns, knives?
- My guitar.
We'll see...
You're modest, mariachi.
You said you killed four men.
But you really killed ten.
Don't you even want to look?
Play!
Play! Sing!
Play!
Sing!
That was the best I ever played.
You inspired me.
You are a mariachi.
And a good one.
- Then hire me.
- I can't. I have no money.
This fancy place, and no money?
It's true.
Pay me room and board.
Would I have to keep the knife
between your legs for inspiration?
If I stay here? No.
Just until I find permanent work.
You won't find work in this town,
but okay.
You'll need a better sense of humour
if you plan to work for me.
This is a letter opener.
Yes?
One moment.
My friend...You haven't
answered the phone all day.
You were busy killing ten of my men.
Six.
I've only killed six.
You were always bad at math.
You thought it was all for you.
I knew half was yours.
I got carried away. But you...
...you're modest.
You killed ten of my men.
I killed six.
Tomorrow I'll double the body count.
I was greedy.
But business is business.
It would have been cheaper for me -
- if I'd paid you.
Now I have to find ten more men.
- Six!
- Ten!
Give me my money and I won't kill
anyone else. I'll even spare you.
No, it's too late for that.
We'll have to see this through.
Just like the Moco I used to know.
Still wearing white?
Why?
I see a white suit,
soaked with blood.
Ready to play?
We're waiting for you.
I'm coming.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.
Hurry up!
This song is called
"Ganas de Vivir".
Are you sure it's okay
for me to sleep here?
As long as you stay on your side.
Remember, I have this...
And him.
The first song you played...
It was an original, wasn't it?
How did you know?
It seemed like you wrote it
for someone.
That's right.
Well...
Sweet dreams.
I have to get my money
at the hotel.
I'll be right back.
Watch my things.
Hi, it's Domino.
I know.
I can't get it open.
Scumbag...
- Hello. What can I get you?
- A beer.
In a bottle.
- Isn't there a girl who works here?
- She's the owner. She'll be back.
She's the owner?
Then she must be Moco's girl.
I don't know.
She hangs around with a musician.
Thanks.
I just saw a guy with a case
like mine. It's him they want.
- He didn't say anything?
- No, he only drank.
I don't look anything like him.
Let's go. He can take all three.
- Is it him?
- I'm not sure.
- What's in the case?
- My guitar.
- Don't tell me you're a mariachi.
- Yes, I am.
Open it.
If it's a guitar, you can go.
But if it's not...
we're gonna mess you up real bad.
Go on!
Don't carry your guitar around
until it's over.
- It's the other guy they want.
- I better put it upstairs.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Look!
It's him!
- Sorry...
- We didn't know what to do.
- We thought you could handle it.
- You thought I could handle it?
Against three armed men?
With this?
My case got switched
with some stupid mariachi's.
- Where's the mariachi?
- He's dead by now.
So go find my case!
- Where were you when he came in?
- I was on the phone with a friend.
- My friend knows what's going on.
- Did you mention me?
No. He told me
the man in black is named Azul.
If his name is Azul,
why doesn't he wear blue?
I don't know. But he's killing
the men who work for a drug dealer.
His name's Mauricio,
but they call him Moco.
Moco sent his men to find Azul.
- So what do they want with me?
- Only Moco has seen him before.
Azul always wears black
and carries a guitar case.
Sounds like you, doesn't it?
Ask your friend to tell Moco
that there's two of us.
A killer and a mariachi.
Moco doesn't talk to just anyone.
It's best to stay in.
Hide your jacket and case
until this passes over.
He got away,
but I got a good look at him.
He killed Piña and Taco.
He won't get away again. I promise.
Are you always closed on Mondays?
- Or is it 'cause I lost my guitar?
- I'm closed Mondays.
- Play me?
- Yeah.
- Hello?
- Come see me.
I can't.
- Please...
- I don't feel so good.
- Have you tried the motorcycle?
- No.
I have to hang up.
- Boyfriend?
- No.
- Gringo?
- Yeah.
There's one thing
I don't understand.
You say you're poor.
Then how did you get this bar?
It was a gift.
- From who?
- Mauricio.
Moco? The guy who wants me dead?
He doesn't want to kill you.
His men confused you with Azul.
Same thing.
You know how it is.
When you want to win a girl -
- you send her
flowers, candy, jewellery...
...until you win her.
Yes...
Mauricio gave me flowers.
Then jewellery.
He let me work in his bar.
Then he gave me the bar.
What was the last thing he gave you?
A motorcycle.
He wants me to drive it to his ranch
when I decide to give myself to him.
He thinks he can convince me.
Can he?
He could have.
But not anymore.
Good morning.
Take this.
I've saved this up.
Buy a new guitar.
Take it. I didn't say
to buy the best one...
Something temporary,
so you can play tonight.
Look for him.
Black pants, white shirt.
- Where did he go?
- He got in my truck.
Bring him around.
That's not him.
- Did you find my case?
- We didn't find it.
We heard you were caught
and taken to Moco's ranch.
- We came to see if it was true.
- They got the mariachi.
- What can I get you?
- A beer.
- Anything else?
- My guitar case.
Where is he?
Where's my case?
- Upstairs.
- Go get it.
If you want to see your mariachi,
come with me.
- Why would you help me?
- You know where Moco's ranch is.
Let's go.
Mauricio!
Play along.
- Domino, let's go!
- She's gone.
They went to find you.
She gave the case back to him.
Open the door or she's dead!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry he used you to get to me.
Pay up, or I'll soak your clothes
with her blood.
Let her go.
I'll give you your money.
Make me a map to Moco's place.
What did you do with him?
- Who?
- The mariachi they thought was him.
That's why you hung up on me
last night.
Throwing a party without me?
With that musician's hands
all over you!
- Give me my money or she's dead!
- After all I've done for you...
This is my thanks?
I've never asked you for anything
until now. Let him go.
- I swear I'll kill her!
- You won't kill her.
I will!
You feel sorry for her, don't you?
All I wanted was my share.
But you have to kill everyone.
That's why you'll never be
as big as me.
You have too much heart.
You must be the mariachi who came
to my town and killed my men.
And stole my girl!
You're very talented.
Playing your little guitar...
Not anymore!
Now get off my property.
And take your hand with you!
All I wanted was to be a mariachi
like my ancestors.
But the town
I thought would bring me luck -
- brought only a curse.
I lost my guitar, my hand and her.
I may never
be able to play the guitar again.
Without her, I have no love.
But with the dog...
and the weapons...
...I'm prepared for the future.
