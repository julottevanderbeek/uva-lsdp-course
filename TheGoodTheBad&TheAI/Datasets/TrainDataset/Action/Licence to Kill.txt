We have a midcourse deviation.
Target heading 036, 1 26 miles,...
..bearing 062, Havana VOR.
He's landing at Cray Key.
Advise Key West Drug Enforcement.
Roger, sir. AWACS to Key West. Key West
Drug Enforcement, please come in.
lfthey hurry, theyjust
might be able to grab the bastard.
Now, you're sure you've got the ring?
Relax, Felix.
-  Friends of yours?
- My partners at the DEA.
- What the hell is going on?!
- Sanchez is in the Bahamas.
- Have you cleared it?
- We've got the green light.
Hey, Felix! Felix!
Haven't you forgotten something?
- Oh, James. Explain to Della, will you?
- No way. I'm coming with you.
OK, but strictly as an observer.
- Sorry, Sharky.
- Hey, why me?
Hey, you guys, you can't do this to me!
What will I tell Della?
What did he promise you? His heart?
Give her his heart.
No. No, Franz. I didn't mean any harm.
It's all right, baby. No te preocupes.
We all make mistakes.
- Your escapades are getting creative.
- Por favor, Franz.
Not a word.
He's still not here.
Can you go around the block again?
- What about the guests?
- I told you this was a mistake.
James. Just in case.
OK.
I want Sanchez alive!
Stay here, James.
- No Sanchez.
- Damn!
Hey, observer!
You trying to get yourself killed?
If I don't get you back for the wedding,
I'm a dead man for sure!
- Do you need help?
- Take your hands off me. Just go away.
Sanchez! Let's go!
Come on! Come on!
- He'll be in Cuban airspace in 20 minutes.
- He hasn't got away yet.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let's go fishing!
Forward. Forward.
Easy. Hold it. Back up. Back up.
Forward now.
Hold it.
Bring him in. Take the load.
Whooee!
Let's go, James!
James! Your hat.
Thank you.

You're facin' 1 39 felony counts, Sanchez.
Why, that's... 936 years.
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.
Two.
What?
Two million. US.
A standing offer
for anyone who springs me.
Goddamn it. You think
you're in some banana republic?
All that scumbag money
won't do you a bit of good here.
Very good. But I think
I'm gonna be home soon, huh?
- Why, you...
- Get hold of yourself!
We got a nice private cell
waiting for your ass at Quantico.
And I'm gonna personally
see you get there.
I'm terribly sorry!
That's a custom. The bride
always gets to kiss her best man.
- I thought it was the other way round.
- Oh.
Oh, James, would you mind? Felix is still
in the study and we've got to cut the cake.
- I'll do anything for a woman with a knife.
- Thank you. Could you help me?
- Sorry.
- No, we're finished. Pam, meet James.
Goodbye, Felix.
- Strictly business, my friend.
- Switch that thing off, Felix.
- You have a house full of guests waiting.
- Just let me save this. Take a seat.
The department wants a full report...
yesterday. We really hit it lucky today.
Sanchez hasn't been out
of his home base for years.
- Couldn't you extradite him?
- He's killed, intimidated or bribed...
..half the officials from here to Chile.
There's only one law
down there - Sanchez's law.
- Plomo o plata.
- Lead or silver.
- Ah.
- Ed.
Double congratulations, old buddy.
You take your time on the honeymoon.
Everything's OK.
You must be Bond.
The guy who came along for the ride.
Ed Killifer.
We're takin' Sanchez
to Quantico this afternoon.
- Stay and have a drink with us.
- Gotta get back.
I just came by to kiss the bride.
- Felix, time to cut the cake.
- Oh. Hand me the picture of Della, quick.
She must be ready to kill me.
- I tied 'em myself.
- What are these?
- Lures.
- These'll keep you busy for a few days.
You're not going fishing
on my honeymoon.
- How many others are being held there?
- Where are you taking him, Mr Killifer?
Mr Sanchez, will you look
this way for a picture, please?
- Come on! Get him inside!
- What is your real nationality?
- Are you really Colombian?
- Have you been fairly treated?
One more picture!
Are you connected with
any laboratories in South America?
- No more questions, now!
- Do you expect to be vindicated?
OK, let's go.
Would you excuse me just a minute?
I have a surprise for you.
Yes, I do! It's right over here.
What's that?
James. Love always. Della and Felix.
We love you.
Thanks.
Come on!
What the hell's happened?
How deep is it there?
Call up an amphibian!
Oh, James.
I wanted you to have something.
You know the tradition? The next one
who catches this is the next one who...
No. No.
Thanks, Della. It's time I left.
Oh, James.
- Did I say something wrong?
- He was married once.
But it was a long time ago.
Felix, you're no good to me
with a wrecked back.
Let her go. I'm the one you want.
Hey! Ready to go? We got
the batteries recharged on the sub.
It'll take you to the limit. Fast boat
to Cuba. You'll be there for breakfast.
- Relax. We'll wait for Dario.
- Look, are you crazy?
You got everybody lookin' for you. What
about Killifer? Havin' a cop here is nuts.
I wanna deep six him.
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm gonna keep my word.
I don't like it. He can finger me.
I spent a fortune on this cover.
Something you'd better
understand, amigo.
Loyalty is more important
to me than money.
Now get the cop.
Killifer.
Here's two million. All in twenties.
It's very heavy, but difficult to trace.
- Smart.
- Now, be ready for tomorrow.
I'll have someone pick you up.
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.
Keep her there until I send for her.
Está bien.
Hey, no foolin' around with my girl.
Are you kiddin'? After what you did
to that guy on the islands?
You liked my little valentine, huh?
- Where's my wife?
- Don't worry.
We gave her a nice honeymoon.
I want you to know
this is nothing personal.
It's purely... business.
Killifer?!
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.
Aagh!
Killing me won't stop anything, Sanchez!
There are worse things
than dying, hombre.
Aagh! Aagh!
Aagh! Aagh!
See you in hell!
No. Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.
No!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Thank you. Your passport, please.
- What's going on?
- Some big drug dealer just escaped.
Now, would that be smoking
or nonsmoking, Mr...
Your ticket!
Felix?
Della!
- Della?
- Felix. You'll be all right. Hang on.
-  Hey, Leiter. Where you been?
- It's Bond. Get an ambulance here, quick!
Hi, Sharky.
You stick around. I might have
some more questions for you, OK?
How is he?
His left leg's gone below the knee.
They might be able to save his arm.
You can bet it was a chain saw.
Colombians use them on informers.
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.
I wish I could be more hopeful,
but we'll have to wait and see.
Chain saw, my ass.
I know a shark bite when I see one.
Sanchez has vanished.
He's got all of Leiter's files.
- God only knows what's in them.
- Well, find him.
He's out of our jurisdiction. There's plenty
of countries that would protect him.
- We can't even get an extradition.
- There are other ways.
- Let it go, Commander.
- You're gonna do nothing?
- You're just gonna forget all about it?
- No, I'm not gonna forget about it.
Looks like Sanchez' law
operates north of the border, too.
Let's go shark-hunting.
This is the last place in the Keys.
We'll have to try Miami next.
Stay here.
You stay out of sight. I'll handle this.
We're closed. Ain't nobody here.
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.
Universal Exports. We've been retained...
..to arrange shipment
of a Carcharodon carcharias.
- A what?
- Great white shark.
It's all right, Bill. Let him in.
Unfortunately, we sold
all our sharks years ago.
As you can see, we do purely research
now. It's a project to feed the Third World.
We feed maggot to our special breed
of genetically engineered fish.
Use hormones to make them all male -
gain weight faster.
From your shark-hunting days?
Uh, yeah. Actually, it's for sale.
Look, I'm kinda busy.
Maybe some other time.
Thank you. I'll look forward
to seeing you again.
- Goodbye, Mr, er...
- Goodbye.
Mr Krest said to be ready. He'll send the
sub back in three hours to pick you up.
Can't wait.
This dump gives me the creeps.
James.
Hold it... right there.
Do you mind if I get
my hands out of here?
Yeah. Do it slowly.
Bon appétit.
Freeze!
Over by the trap door, old buddy.
Is this where you put
your old buddy Felix?
Not me. Chalk that one up
to Sanchez and Krest.
Whoa! Whoa!
There's two million dollars
in that suitcase.
I'll split it with you.
You earned it.
You keep it... old buddy.
Aagh!
God, what a terrible waste.
Of money.
Hey, Sharky!
- Any news on the Wavekrest?
- She's a big marine-research vessel,...
..owned by a Milton Krest.
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sel Bank.
- How long will it take us to get there?
- Maybe about six hours.
I've a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.
Hey, Commander. You got a minute?
Local cops got a tip
about a warehouse last night.
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian pure,
a couple of stiffs,...
..and a little bitty piece
of what used to be Killifer.
Good. At least someone's on the case.
You may be a pal of Leiter's,
but I can only cover up so much.
The DEA is screaming
to know what happened.
You know, we, we got laws
in this country, too.
Do you have a law against
what they did to Leiter?
Look, you're in over your head.
This is where it ends, Commander.
You were supposed to be
in lstanbul last night.
I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter
business has... clouded your judgment.
You have a job to do. I expect you
on a plane this afternoon.
- I haven't finished here, sir.
- Leave it to the Americans.
- It's their mess. Let them clear it up.
- Sir, they're not going to do anything.
I owe it to Leiter. He's put his life
on the line for me many times.
Oh, spare me this sentimental rubbish!
He knew the risks.
- And his wife?
- This private vendetta of yours...
..could easily compromise
Her Majesty's Government.
You have an assignment. I expect you to
carry it out objectively and professionally.
Then you have my resignation, sir.
We're not a country club, 007.
Effective immediately...
your licence to kill is revoked,...
..and I require you
to hand over your weapon.
Now.
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.
Well, I guess it's, er...
..a farewell to arms.
Don't! Too many people!
God help you, Commander.
Something in Sector C.
You caused us all
a lot of trouble, young lady.
- You're borracho. Go to bed.
- When Sanchez heard you ran away,...
- ..he went nuts.
- It's none of your business.
It's my business when your stupid
little tricks get Sanchez arrested...
..and I gotta put my organisation
at risk to get him out.
The DEA just raided Key West.
You cost me a lot of dough.
- He'll give you the money.
- Uh-uh.
He doesn't work that way.
You'd better watch yourself, girlie.
I've known him a long time. I've seen
a lot of girls like you come... and go.
You're drunk. Get out.
- And stop peeking through my windows.
- Come on. What are you so stuck-up for?
He fixed that phoney
beauty contest you won.
- Hey...
- Mr Krest.
Yeah. What?
The Sentinel's picking up something large
on the monitor. You'd better take a look.
I don't believe this.
What the hell is it now?
It's just a manta ray. Get the probe
back in. We'll start loading now.
Yes, sir.
He said "You're OK."
Take care of him.
Make a sound and you're dead.
- You...
- What are you doing in here?
- Krest gave me his cabin. He's next door.
- Where's Sanchez?
He's not on board.
I don't know where he is.
- You're his girlfriend.
- He doesn't tell me anything.
Open up. I need to talk to you.
Answer it.
Just a moment.
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard. Did you...
- ..see anybody?
- No, I was sleeping. Go away.
Mr Krest. They're back.
Bolt your door.
Who whipped you? Sanchez?
It was my fault.
I did something wrong, made him angry.
- Nice work, Clive.
- Thanks, Mr Krest.
Guess what? His name was Sharky.
Get rid of the boat.
We've got work to do.
- You'd better find yourself a new lover.
- Don't you men know any other way?
It's Sanchez' way. You seem to like it.
You know nothing. Please go.
If they find you here, we'll both be killed.
Stay here.
We got everything useful out of her.
- That's it. Take her out and sink her.
- OK, Clive. Cast off!
Compliments of Sharky.
Man overboard!
Get him! Don't let him get away!
- What's wrong?
- Get back in your cabin and stay there.
- The guy must have drowned, Mr Krest.
- Don't be so sure. Find him.
- Launch Sentinel.
- Yes, sir.
Stand by to dive when I tell you.
Numbers one and two, dive!
I can see something reflecting over there.
There's too much turbulence to be sure.
- Wavekrest, Wavekrest. Estamos listos.
- Muy bien.
- Loading completed, Mr Krest.
- Bring Sentinel back in.
Mr Krest!
Bring Sentinel up!
There he is, there! Right there! Get him!
There!
Dive, dammit! Dive!
Se ha caído.
Aagh!
Aagh!
There! Pick him up!
- All boats return to Wavekrest!
- Aye aye, sir!
Here. Put her stern-in.
Hey, do you know
someone called Bouvier?
Over there.
Now, this is an unexpected pleasure.
- Where's Leiter?
- Intensive Care.
Where you'll be
if you don't get out of here fast.
Sanchez has Leiter's files.
Your name's all over them.
Hell, I knew something was wrong.
Those two have been at the bar for hours.
- Probably waiting to see who showed up.
- Would you like anything to drink?
- Bud with a lime.
- Same.
Sure thing, hon.
Shit! It's Dario.
He's bad news. He used to be with
the Contras before they kicked him out.
Just the kind of guy Sanchez would send.
You carrying?
If they start shooting,
just hit the deck and stay there.
La senorita Bouvier.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.
I got a job for you. Why don't we
go outside and we talk in private?
- Take your hands off her! She's with me.
- Nobody's asking you, gringo.
He's with me.
Keep your hands on the table.
Here we go.
Two beers. That'll be 3.50.
- Do your friends want something?
- Let me get it.
- He's had enough. Run a tab.
- OK.
- How did you get here?
- By boat. It's right behind this wall.
Thanks.
Touché!
Get it started.
Come on!
- Don't move.
- Relax. It's a bulletproof vest.
- This Kevlar is great!
- You're bloody lucky to be alive!
It's not luck. It's experience.
- Any higher, it'd have been your head.
- Look, I just saved your life back there!
If it wasn't for me,
your ass would've been nailed to the wall.
- You saved my life?
- Yes.
It's a tough business
you picked, Miss Bouvier.
- Leave it to the professionals.
- Look, pal, I was an army pilot.
I have flown to the toughest hellholes!
I will not have you lecture me
about professionalism!
Out of gas. I haven't heard
that one in a long time.
Well, they must have hit the fuel line.
Look, I'm gonna need your help.
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez' operation.
And I'll need a flight to lsthmus City.
Private. No one must know I've left.
- What do you wanna go there for?
- I'll pay you very well.
You're going after Sanchez, aren't you?
- Will you help me?
- How many men have you got?
Just you and me.
Are you crazy? Sanchez has
an entire army protecting him.
- Just fly me in and leave. 50,000.
- It's not that easy.
False flight plans, payoffs at the airport.
I can't do it for less than a hundred.
Sixty.
- Ninety.
- Seventy.
- Eighty.
- Seventy-five.
- You pay the fuel?
- You get the plane.
Deal.
- Why don't you wait until you're asked?
- Well, why don't you ask me?
There are five typing errors on
the first page alone. What's got into you?
Sorry, sir.
"US lmmigration has no reports
of 007 leaving the United States...
..as of 1 500 hours today."
- Who authorised this?
- I did, sir. It's James. He's gone missing.
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.
He's got to be stopped.
I've already alerted our man in lsthmus.
- I want that out by this afternoon.
- Yes, sir.
Q Branch, please.
Hector Lopez, tu presidente,...
..te pide que votes por los candidatos
del Partido Revolucionario lsthmo.
Beneficios para el pueblo
con Hector Lopez.
Beneficios para el pueblo. Hector Lopez.
This is the master bedroom.
- I hope everything is satisfactory, senor.
- It's adequate.
I'd like a case of champagne -
Bollinger RD.
Certainly. If I could ask you
to sign the registration cards?
No. My executive secretary,
Miss Kennedy, will take care of that.
Miss Kennedy.
Right here, please.
Gracias.
Fresh flowers every day.
Thank you very much.
Your key. Enjoy your stay.
It's Ms Kennedy. And why can't you
be my executive secretary?
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.
Thanks for everything.
Your job's finished.
- I wanna stay.
- Too dangerous.
- Enough people are dead.
- Don't talk to me about danger.
I won't be safe until Sanchez is dead.
Besides, you could use my help.
If you're gonna stay and be my executive
secretary, you'd better look the part.
Here. Buy yourself some decent clothes.
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.
The biggest one in town.
Banco de lsthmus. He owns it.
-
- Adelante.
Senor Bond.
- I've come to make a small deposit.
- My people downstairs are capable of...
Please, sit down.
We operate the world's
largest private investment fund.
Our biggest problem...
is what to do with all the money.
We have a cash surplus
of ten million a day,...
..which we ship through our bank
to the US Federal Reserve,...
..thus establishing credits which can
be used for any legitimate investment.
You see, someone has to help
the gringos with their trade deficit.
Make out a deposit receipt
for $4,900,000 for Senor Bond.
Sí, senor.
And there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.
Of course. We are experienced in
handling accounts of this nature.
- Let me pass.
- No. No puede pasar sin permiso.
Tenemos un cliente aquí.
Senor Montelongo? I'm Miss Kennedy,
Mr Bond's executive secretary.
I'd also appreciate it if you could establish
a line of credit for me at the casino.
- Shall we say two million dollars?
- No problem.
You have excellent collateral,
and our chairman also owns the casino.
- A very convenient arrangement.
- We have always thought so, senorita.
Thank you. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, and welcome.
This is a special night for us.
We want you to know that only
through your generous donations...
..can the work here at the OMI
continue to progress.
We've learned so much,
but we've only just scratched the surface.
We need your help. We need you to go
to your phones now and make a pledge.
This is not for me.
This is not for them. It's for all ofus.
- Are you OK, reinita?
- I'm fine.
Krest called me from the boat with a story
about somebody ripping him off.
Did you see anything happen?
No, Franz. I stayed
in my cabin most of the time.
- What's the matter, baby?
- You know I can't stand that thing.
- I'd like a private table. Blackjack.
- Certainly, Senor Bond.
Would you come this way, please?
- Quarter of a million dollars.
- Sí, senor.
And I'd like to raise
the limit to 5,000 a box.
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.
Dario'll take you shopping, so tomorrow
you can spend a lot of money, have fun.
Now, give me a little kiss.
You want one too?
We can raise the price.
I like that.
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge. 22,000.
Our goal today is to raise $22,000
from each of our meditation chapters.
That's 22,000 each.
Go to your phones.
Please help us. Bless your hearts.
Let me have half a million.
Listen to this. Our wonderful Manhattan
chapel has made a special $500 pledge.
- I knew they'd go for it.
- This guy cracks me up.
- Is Senor Sanchez there?
- Yes, he's right here.
- Yeah?
- A British sucker dropped...
..a quarter of a million
and he wants to play no limit.
- Which one?
- Table two. Plays like a real jerk-off.
That's the guy that flew in in the private
plane. Opened an account at the bank.
Five million dollars... in cash.
Let him play.
Double down.
Split.
Listen to this. Our Chicago chapel
has received a $1,000 donor pledge.
- They all accepted the new price.
-
- Senor Sanchez?
- Yes, he's right here.
Sí?
The British guy is a quarter of a million
ahead. Should I close the table?
No.
- Tell Lupe to come in here.
- Right.
You have good luck tonight.
Are you gonna share any of that money?
Miss Kennedy,
get me a medium-dry vodka martini.
- Why don't you ask...
- Shaken, not stirred.
Cut.
- You're very professional.
- Used to work here.
- Am I going to win or lose?
- Lose. But not much.
- Vodka martini qué?
- Shaken, not stirred.
Ah, sí.
Looks like your luck has changed.
- Is that why he sent you?
- And to find out more about you.
Perhaps I'd better quit for the night.
You should walk straight out of here,
go to the airport and never come back.
- Where's Sanchez?
- Upstairs in his office.
He's been there all day. He's planning a
party for some Orientals tomorrow night.
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?
Nothing. Now go.
- Take me to him.
- Are you loco? You'll get us both killed.
Buenas noches, senor. This way, please.
Send us a dollar. Send us 50 cents.
Send whatever you can send.
We've got a very special offer. You guys
out there, with your beer and popcorn...
Un momento, por favor.
This is almost over.
This particular book has sold
in excess ofa quarter ofa million copies.
Anyone who sends in a $100 pledge...
..will receive a personally
autographed copy ofmy book.
Lovely view.
It's a 49.95 value,
and you get it... absolutely free.
- Bond. James Bond.
- Sit. Please.
We need your help.
Bless your hearts.
Well-travelled man.
You did all right at the tables tonight.
I had the feeling
my luck was about to change.
Well, it's a wise gambler who knows
when his luck has run out. Why this?
In my business,
you prepare for the unexpected.
- And what business is that?
- I help people with problems.
Problem solver.
More of a problem eliminator.
- And are you here on business?
- No, temporarily unemployed.
