Girl:
Woman:
Here they come again.
Max rockatansky.
Worming their way into
the black matter of my brain.
Help us, Max.
You promised to help us.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
War boy: After him!
War boy #2: After him!
Now!
I am the one who runs from
both the living and the dead,
haunted by those
I could not protect.
A man reduced
to a single instinct...
Max?
Is that you?
Where were you?
Help us.
Where were you?
Help us, Max.
Where were you, Max?
Help us!
Help us, Max.
Stop running.
You let us die.
You let us die!
You let us die!
Girl:
You promised to help us.
Why?
Witness!
Ace: We are war boys!
War boys! War boys!
War boys! War boys!
Kamakrazee war boys!
War boys! War boys!
War boys! War boys!
Fucacima kamakrazee war boys!
Hooked on!
Today we're headin'
to gas town!
Gas town! Gas town!
Gas town! Gas town!
Today we're haulin'
aqua cola.
Aqua cola! Aqua cola!
Aqua cola! Aqua cola!
Today we're haulin'
produce!
Produce! Produce!
Produce! Produce!
And today we're haulin'
mother's milk!
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!
Mother's milk! Mother's milk!
Rev it up
for the immortan Joe!
Once again,
we send off my war rig
to bring back guzzoline
from gas town
and bullets
from the bullet farm.
Once again,
I salute my imperator, furiosa!
And I salute
my half-life war boys
who will ride with me eternal
on the highways of Valhalla.
I am your redeemer!
It is by my hand you will rise
from the ashes of this world!
It's comin'.
G-get ready.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
It's comin'.
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.
It will take hold of you.
And you will resent
its absence.
Winchman: Clear off!
Get 'em all off!
Clear off!
Signal gas town.
Convoy's on its way.
I got a war boy
runnin' on empty.
Hook up that full-life.
Hey! Careful.
That's a universal donor.
Boss, we're not going
to gas town?
Bullet farm?
We're heading east.
I'll pass it down the line.
New orders!
Thunder up!
Thunder up!
This is not a supply run!
Go. Go. Go.
Ace, what's going on?
We're heading east.
Why?
I don't know.
That's the order.
Moo.
Hey, pa.
Hm?
You know about this?
Your produce
ain't going to gas town.
She's gone off-road...
Into hostile territory.
Why would she
do that, dad?
Let me see.
Let me see.
Rictus.
I wanna see!
Rictus, go see
what's agitating dad!
Splendid!
Angharad!
Where are they?
They are not your property.
Miss giddy?
You cannot own
a human being.
Sooner or later
someone pushes back!
Where is she taking them?!
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go.
Where is she taking them?
A long way from you.
Aah!
Hey, what's happening?
Slit.
What's going on?
Slit!
Treason, betrayal,
an imperator gone rogue.
An imperator. Who?
Furiosa.
She took a lot of stuff
from immortan Joe.
W-what stuff?
Breeders.
His prize breeders.
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.
By my deeds, I honor him.
V-8.
Oh!
That's my wheel.
I'm driving.
You're my lancer.
I just promoted myself.
Not today. Today is my day.
Look at you!
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war!
He's right, son.
I'm not staying here
dying soft.
Ah, you're already
a corpse.
I just need a top-up,
some more juice. There's no time!
We take my blood bag.
We take my blood bag and strap
him to the lancer's perch.
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral. That's right.
High-octane crazy blood
fillin' me up.
If I'm gonna die...
I'm gonna die historic
on the fury road.
Yeah. Yeah.
Organic.
Organic mechanic: Yeah?
Hitch up his blood bag.
Right-o.
Yeah!
Ah! How much more
can they take from me?
They've got my blood.
Now it's my car!
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!
Ah!
He looked at me!
He looked right at me!
He looked
at your blood bag!
He turned his head.
He looked me
straight in the eye.
He was scanning
the horizon.
No.
I am awaited.
I am awaited in Valhalla!
Immortan!
Yeah!
Hey! Heads up!
Heads up!
Boss!
We got vehicles
from the citadel.
They're firing flares.
They want reinforcements
from gas town
and the bullet farm.
What is this?
Backup? Decoy?
It's a detour.
Eyes right.
Buzzards!
Buzzards right!
Eyes on! Eyes on!
Buzzards right!
Eyes on!
War boy: Eyes on! Yeah!
Should we turn it 'round
and run 'em into our backup?
Furiosa:
No. We're good.
We fang it!
Thunder up!
Here we go!
Prepare the gunners!
Morsov!
Come on, attack!
War!
Ready!
Nux: She's ours, slit!
She's ours.
First, we get the buzzards
off her back!
Form up!
That's my head!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Get up!
You can do it!
Morsov!
War boy: Morsov!
No!
Witness me!
Witness!
Witness!
Witness!
Slit:
Mediocre, morsov!
Mediocre!
Aah!
Ready!
Get ready!
Back me in!
They're coming!
Ah!
We can't breathe
down there!
Stay out of sight!
Now!
Aah!
Go back!
Hydraulics!
Hydraulics!
Yeah.
Now we bring home
the Booty.
Aah!
She thinks she can lose us, dad.
She thinks
we're stupid.
She thinks she can lose us
in there!
Slit: Fang it!
Fang it!
Why can't you stop?
Crew!
Outta the way!
Out of the way!
What have you done?
What have you done?!
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.
Hunt them down!
Hunt them down!
Aah!
Hey, head...
Say bye-bye
to the neck!
We're goin' in, slit!
Come on!
We've almost got her!
Come on!
Hold it steady!
Aah!
Oh, what a day!
What a lovely day!
I am the man...
Who grabs the sun...
...riding to Valhalla!
Witness me, blood bag!
Witness!
I live, I die,
I live again!
We're not going back.
Water.
Ahh.
Ah.
You.
The dag: Angharad,
is that just the wind,
or is it
a furious vexation?
I got it!
Aah!
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.
He's gonna shred her.
Shred her!
Bolt cutters.
Chain.
Hey, hey!
Oh, look at them.
So shiny,
so chrome.
He's gonna be
so grateful.
We could ask
for anything.
I wanna drive
the war rig.
What are you
gonna ask for?
That's my jacket.
Sure.
I mean, you can ask
for more than a jacket.
We're going
to the green place.
Wait, it's you and me.
We're going to the green place
of many mothers.
How does it feel?
It hurts.
Out here,
everything hurts.
You wanna get through this?
Do as I say.
Now pick up what you can
and run.
Kill switches.
I set the sequence
myself.
This rig goes nowhere
without me.
You can get in.
Not without them.
So we wait.
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.
You've already damaged
one of his wives.
How grateful
do you think he's gonna be?
You're sitting
on 2,000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted
war machine.
I'd say you've got
about a five-minute head start.
You want that thing
off your face?
Let's go.
Uh-uh-uh.
Of all the legs
you had to shoot,
that one was attached
to his favorite.
Smeg!
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.
What choice does she have?
Toast: He's not gonna hurt us.
He needs us.
Why?
To bargain.
Oh, he'll hurt us,
all right.
Fragile: Do you think he's coming to the green place?
Never!
He's a crazy smeg
who eats
Ah, stay out of there.
Behind you.
Huh?
The gas town boys.
Don't damage the good.
Furiosa:
What do you see?
Splendid: Big rigs.
Polecats.
Flamers.
And there's
the people eater himself.
Coming to count the cost.
Hm.
Aah!
We're dragging something
out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.
Max: No, no.
I'll go.
Filth!
You traited him!
Splendid:
No unnecessary killing!
This war boy
wants me dead!
We agreed!
He's kamakrazee!
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life.
No! I live, I die,
I live again!
Hold him!
Tie him up!
Get off him.
Throw him out!
The dag:
Chuck him out.
You got more friends.
Bullet farmer.
They're coming from the bullet farm.
Yeah?
It's over.
You can't defy him.
Just watch us, mate.
He is the one
who grabbed the sun.
Toast: Look at how slick
he's fooled you, war boy!
He's a lying old man.
By his hand,
we'll be lifted up!
That's why we have his logo
seared on our backs!
"Breeding stock!"
"Battle fodder!"
No, I am awaited!
You're an old man's battle fodder!
Killing everyone and everything!
We're not to blame!
Then who killed
the world?
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.
I don't know
if it's still any good.
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.
I need you here.
You may have to drive
the rig.
You.
You stay.
You stay there.
Whatever you do,
you can't be seen.
I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.
Down here.
Hey.
What's your name?
What do I call you?
Does it matter?
Fine.
When I yell "fool,"
you drive out of here
as fast as you can.
This is the sequence...
One.
One, two.
One.
Red, black, go.
You have it?
It's all here!
Three thousand gallons
of guzzoline,
just like you asked!
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.
You drop the rocks.
Rock rider chief: You said,
"a few vehicles in pursuit.
Maybe."
We count
three war parties!
Yeah, well,
I got unlucky.
Let's do this!
Fool!
That's our fuel!
Make way for the ripsaw!
Immortan Joe:
Once I'm over, clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.
Immortan!
Immortan Joe!
I got a war boy!
Says he was on the war rig!
You! Climb aboard!
Slit: Hey! Hey!
I got his boot!
I got
the blood bag's boot!
Take me!
I got his boot!
All this
for a family squabble.
Healthy babies.
Reload the clip.
I-I can't.
Gun!
Give the gun!
It's not loaded yet!
You!
Now!
We had a deal!
Aah!
Aah!
Rictus!
The wives!
No more flames.
Immortan Joe: Splendid!
Splendid!
That's my child!
My property!
Immorta...
Immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.
What is your name?
It's nux.
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.
No.
Put a bullet in her skull,
stop the rig,
return my treasures to me,
and I myself
will carry you
to the gates of Valhalla.
Am I awaited?
You will ride eternal...
Shiny and chrome.
Rictus!
Help him aboard!
Ready?
Here we go!
Mediocre!
Aah!
Capable: Look out!
Immortan Joe: Angharad!
Get out!
No!
Angharad!
Stop!
Turn the rig around!
Go back for her!
No.
Tell him
to turn the rig around!
Did you see it?
She went under the wheels.
Did you see it?
She went
under the wheels.
We keep moving.
No!
We keep moving!
He doesn't know
what he's talking about!
Whatever happens,
we're going to the green place.
The stupid green place.
We don't even know
where to find it.
You all right?
On! On!
Capable: Cheedo!
The dag:
Cheedo, don't be stupid.
Stop! He'll forgive us.
I know he will.
There is no going back!
We were his treasures!
Cheedo!
We were protected.
He gave us the high life.
What wrong with that?
We are not things.
No!
Cheedo,
we are not things!
We are not things.
I don't want to hear
that again!
They were her words!
And now she's dead!
The dag:
Wring your hands.
You're not going back
to him.
Angharad!
Come on!
Come on!
So, um...
Where is this...
This green place?
It's a long night's run,
heading east.
Hm.
We need inventory.
I want you to match every gun
with its bullets.
I'm gonna go down
and do some repairs.
We need someone
down the back.
I'll go.
No.
I want you
to stay together.
I can do it.
What are you doing here?
He saw it.
He saw it all.
My own blood bag
drivin' the rig that killed her.
Stop doing that.
Shh, shh, shh.
Stop.
Thr... three times
the gates were open to me.
What gates?
I was awaited in Valhalla.
They were calling my name.
I should be walking
with the immorta,
mcfeasting with the heroes
of all time.
I'd say it was
your manifest Destiny not to.
I thought I was being spared
for something great.
I got to drive
a pursuit vehicle.
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.
Who are Larry and Barry?
My mates.
Larry and Barry.
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.
Well, we've only got four
for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.
But we can squirt off
this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.
Angharad used to call them
antiseed.
Plant one
and watch something die.
We are down
The deficit mounts.
And now, sir, you have us
stuck in a quagmire.
Organic mechanic: Hey, Joe!
Boss!
Your girly's
breathing her last!
What about the child?
Are ya comin', brother?
Wait!
It's gone awful quiet
in there.
Get it out.
Get it out!
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!
Patience!
Oh, you stay here
with your grief, daddy.
I'll fetch 'em for ya.
Be careful!
Protect the assets!
Just one angry shot...
For furiosa.
Hut!
Cryin' shame.
Come.
Nother month...
Could've been
your viable human.
Was it a male?
Your a-one Alpha prime.
Hey, rictus!
Rictus: Huh?
You lost a baby brother.
Perfect in every way.
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!
Come on.
Wouldn't wanna shoot
the wives, sir.
Just probing.
Capable:
He wants to help!
Who?!
The war boy!
Where did he come from?!
The dag: I thought we threw him
off the rig!
T-there's high ground
just beyond that thing.
He means the tree.
Yeah. Tree!
Leave him to me.
Say, anyone notice
that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?
Get out. I-I can do this.
I know this machine.
Capable: He does.
He's a revhead.
You've got two left.
On him.
Don't breathe.
Aah!
Toast: Hey!
Hey! Hey!
War boy!
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!
Take this.
Let's get the engine plates.
Max:
You drive the rig!
Hold up a flare.
I am holding a flare!
Closer.
It's right in front
of your eyes!
Hut! Hut!
Blood bag!
I am the scales of justice!
Conductor of the choir
of death!
Sing, brother koch!
Sing, brothers, sing!
Sing!
Don't they know
they're shooting at us?
Gun fever!
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.
How are the engines?
Very hot and real thirsty.
Hey.
You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.
What if you're not back
by the time
the engines have cooled?
Well, you keep moving.
What do you suppose
he's gonna do?
Retaliate first.
Let's go!
Oh.
Toast: Are you hurt?
Huh?
You're bleeding.
That's not his blood.
What is this?
It's mother's milk.
It's okay.
Sleep.
Get some rest.
How do you know
this place even exists?
I was born there.
So why'd you leave?
I didn't.
I was taken as a child.
Stolen.
You done this before?
Many times.
Now that I drive
a war rig...
This is the best shot
I'll ever have.
And them?
They're looking for hope.
What about you?
Redemption.
Hey, what's that?
I remember
something like that.
Woman: Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Uh-oh.
Please!
That's bait.
Stay in the rig.
Hurry! Please, hurry!
They'll be back!
I am one of the vuvalini!
Of the many mothers!
My initiate mother
was k.T. Concannon!
I am the daughter
of Mary jabassa.
My clan
was swaddle dog!
It's me.
There's something
in the eyes.
Perhaps it is jabassa's child.
This is our furiosa.
How long has it been?
Plus the ones
I don't remember.
Furiosa.
What happened to your mother?
She died.
On the third day.
From where did you come?
The west. Citadel.
Beyond the mountains.
The men...
Who are they?
They're reliable.
They helped us get here.
Oh.
Where did you find
such creatures?
So soft.
This one has all her teeth.
Oh!
I can't wait
for them to see it.
See?
See what?
Home.
The green place.
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.
The crows.
The creepy place
with all the crows.
The soil.
We had to get out.
We had no water and...
The water was filth.
It was poisoned.
It was sour.
And the crows came.
We couldn't grow anything.
Toast:
Where are the others?
V-Gillian:
What others?
The many mothers.
We're the only ones left.
Look.
V-melita: That's what you call
a satellite.
Toast: Miss giddy
told us about those.
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.
Shows.
Everyone in the old world
had a show.
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?
Sending shows?
Who knows?
Those are the plains
of silence.
Stay right where you are,
little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty
out here.
You having a baby?
Warlord Jr.
Gonna be so ugly.
It could be a girl.
You kill people with that,
do ya?
Killed everyone I ever met
out here.
Headshots, all of 'em.
Snap.
Right in the medulla.
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.
Come here.
Take a peek.
Seeds.
These are from home.
Heirlooms.
The real thing.
I plant one
every chance I get.
Where?
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.
Ah, so many
different kinds.
Trees, flowers, fruit.
Back then,
everyone had their fill.
Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.
Can I talk to you?
I've talked with the others.
We're never gonna have
a better chance
to make it
across the salt.
If we leave the rig here
and load the motorcycles up
with as much as we can,
we can maybe ride
for 160 days.
One of those bikes
is yours.
Fully loaded.
You're more than welcome
to come with us.
I'll... I'll make
my own way.
You know,
hope is a mistake.
If you can't fix what's broken,
you'll, uh...
...you'll go insane.
Help us.
You promised to help us.
Come on, pa.
Let's go.
All right.
This is your way home.
We go back?
Mm.
Back?
Yeah.
I thought you weren't
insane anymore.
What are they saying?
He wants to go back
from where they came.
The citadel.
And what's there to find
at the citadel?
Green.
Toast: And water.
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water.
And a lot of crops.
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.
Where does the water
come from?
He pumps it up
from deep in the earth.
Calls it aqua cola
and claims it all for himself.
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.
I don't like him already.
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.
Max: No.
I suggest we go back
the same way we came.
Through the canyon.
It's open.
We know that. Right?
He brought
all his war parties through.
So we take the war rig
and we charge it
right through the middle
of them.
We can decouple the tanker
at the pass.
Shut it off behind us.
Kaboom!
And how exactly
do we take the citadel?
Assuming we're still alive
by then?
If we can block the pass,
it'll be easy.
All that's left
are his war pups
and war boys
too sick to fight.
Capable: And we'll be with nux.
He's a war boy.
He'll be bringing us home,
bringing back what's stolen,
as he's meant to.
Nux: Yeah.
It feels like hope.
V-Melissa:
I like this plan.
We can start again.
Just like the old days.
Look,
it'll be a hard day.
But I guarantee you
that 160 days ridin' that way,
there's nothin' but salt.
At least that way,
you know, we might be able to...
Together...
Come across
some kind of redemption.
Lookout: War rig!
That's the war rig!
That's them.
Why are they going back?
Do they wish to surrender?
They are heading
for the canyon.
They're going back
to the citadel!
They know
it's undefended!
Bullocks!
Roll up! Roll up!
Go!
What are you doing?
Praying.
To who?
Anyone that's listening.
Here we go, girls!
That's mine!
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.
Don't blow my engine.
I'm gonna nudge him.
Just a little.
You filth!
You traitored him!
Go.
Got to back off.
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.
Right.
Are you a black thumb?
Uh-huh.
All right.
Engine one now.
You and me,
fifth wheel.
We'll unhook the tanker.
One man, one bullet.
I cannot see.
Maadi! Maadi!
I cannot see.
Oh!
Hey!
Harpoons and plows!
They're hauling us back!
Leave three bolts.
Three.
Aah!
Aah!
Hey, you!
Are you okay?
I think she's hurt.
Hey!
No!
Girl:
V-gil: Stay with me.
Hey.
Are you there?
You finish that!
I'll finish her!
Valhalla!
Nux: Oi!
Aah!
Engine one's good.
For now.
Aah!
She's hurt!
She's hurt real bad!
You hear that?
We're gonna see
two airborne v-8s.
I'm gonna need you
to drive.
I'll get him
out of our way.
Rictus! Take me!
Cheedo!
What are you doing?
Aah!
No!
Big boy!
Aah!
Here! Here!
Hey!
No!
Remember me?
He's dead!
He's dead.
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle
and follow you.
V-melito: Come on!
Hurry!
We're nearly at the pass.
Witness me.
Rictus!
Why is she making
that noise?
She's pumping air
into her chest cavity.
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know. I know.
Hold it there.
All right.
Put that on there.
Press it on.
Hey.
Hey.
Home.
Home.
N-no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
She's exsanguinated.
Drained all her blood.
Hold these.
We need that.
Thank you.
Needle.
Come on!
Take this.
Keep her awake.
Furiosa.
Okay,
that's not retracting.
There we go.
All right, hold it up.
Hold it up.
Okay.
Sorry.
There you go. Okay.
There you go.
Max.
My name is Max.
That's my name.
