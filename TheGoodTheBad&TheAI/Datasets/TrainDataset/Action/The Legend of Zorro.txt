a good man
That I can give you certainty
It arrives, it is already enough
Alejandro,

Of course yes
I suggest, that we play

Beautiful city
Parents
Naturally
- Can I offer it something to drink?
- Tequila with salt
Perhaps a poker departure
it would be less harmful for its health
Did he/she fall it something?
or does he/she only rest?
He/she knows, I think I like
he/she gave game
Promise me, that when
to lose, he/she will leave us alone
What does make you to think that I will lose?
Feminine intuition
For the winner
there are not pretexts
Now, maintain yours
promise and leave
He/she cheated,
it is not worth like this
Good-bye Alejandro
What does know about that name?
We should never have ourselves married
He/she doesn't love him
After 10 years of
marriage with me
It cannot hide
the truth
The cantineiro, heard in its tavern

for the love of God
Guillermo Cortez was
only the beginning
It is now Elena it is
running a lot of danger
Then, I beg it that
Give me courage...

It helps me to demonstrate that
Zorro was right
It will go to the vineyard

Consider it as one
acceptable loss
Master Armand
Please...
..desculpe, one moment.
That is very beautiful
And the one behind that door what is there?
The chapel
It is a long family tradition
I would show you but...

or Zorro?
I heard that among the places
He/she is a peasant masked as
Monday hero
Men like this, finish always
in the guillotine
They informed me that some of my ships

The sailor's anchor
The load should arrive here
