You think the worId's ready for that?
The other thing.
We got the go-ahead.
We got a firm date on the Swiss thing.
I'm burnt. They got my picture.
Of you in drag

Why don't you?
If I was a pubIisher. But I'm a thief
so I have to do that thing.
Give me our cut.
We'll do the Swiss job.
You know that's bullshit.
You're going traveIing.
You gonna pIay me for a sucker?

The bag is empty.
Put the bag down, it's empty.
Want me to pull up a chair

If you'd pause in your
headstrong progress--
Joe, I'm in hock for all the toys.
All the toys you said go out

-You said spend the money.
-What do you want?
I want you to do the other thing.
You screwed me.
Now my face is on a cereaI box.
You got no money!
You're burnt and busted.
What the fuck does it take
to get you to do the other thing?
Excuse me, Mr. Bergman
asked you a question.
Excuse me,
my uncIe asked you a question.
-Fuck your uncIe.
-Fuck my uncIe? You're the heIp.
Yeah, I'm the heIp, motherfucker.
Why'd the chicken cross the road?
Because the road crossed the chicken.
-WaIk away.

Situation is pristine.
Cut him off.
I didn't see him.
Oh, my God!
How is he?
It's his road game.
-Your man does good work.
-That's why I use him.
Yeah, these will pass anywhere.
Why don't you take advantage of it?
No.
I need somebody to throw me

Yeah, give the gentIeman a call.
-I need some waIking-around money.
-That's reasonabIe.
And I'm gonna need my men's share

-Give it to me.
-Now?
You got it in your pocket.
You're ahead of me every turn.
Stunning.
The pIan hoIds,

The pIan has changed.
We spIit it 50/50 on the site.
So be it.
-Now what's your surprise?
-My boy comes with you on the job.
-He's got terribIe manners.
-Which of us is perfect?
So be it.
Wait a sec. If it's about
your wife, why didn't you--?
Will you wait? If the whoIe thing
is about your wife--?
You know what?
The hell with it!
Not a happy camper, huh?
I'm not a camper at all, stud.
Pour it.
See anything you Iike?
I'm busy.
-Pour it!
-Hope you're not driving.
I hope I am, and I run into
some fucked abutment.
-Take me off, will you?
-That'll rot your stomach Iining.
Yeah, but I get to drink it first.
-That's all I need.
-What?
There goes my job.
You see his badge?
Do you know where that guy is from?
And he caught me drinking on shift.
End of a perfect day.
-That's Betty Croft.
-What's her probIem?
-She's a drunk.
-She's a drunk.
You bet she is.
-Why is she important?
-She gets us in the door.
She gets us in the door, how?
I want you to Ieave the uniforms
on the porch 3 or 4 days.
Get the dry-cIeaning smell
out of them.
When we do the switch, the highway--
-Nobody can hear.
-If you don't say it.
I'm as quiet as
an ant pissing on cotton.
I don't want you as quiet as that ant.
I want you as quiet as an ant not
even thinking about pissing on cotton.
Hello. I gotta report
a breakdown here.
I got one of your rentaIs.
I need a tow truck.
Oh, come on, don't tell me that.
-Yeah, all right.
-What's the story on your paI?
He was born, he suffered, he died.
-Can he do the thing?
-He was doing it before you were born.
See, that's what troubIes me.
Maybe you want to pray about it?
-No, I'm not a reIigious man.
-That's a shame.
-How's the Ieg?
-Never better.
-How Iong has he been with that girI?
-Who?
-His wife.
-How Iong is a Chinaman's name?
How Iong is a Chinaman's name?
You ever notice that?
Got the uniforms?
Yeah, I got them.
I got them all aired out.
-RentaI trucks?
-Yeah.
What do we got?
Gotta redo some of these figures.
-I gotta start from scratch.
-Worked out on the pIan. Why now?
When things start to go sour,
someone's gonna be pissing.
Looking to shoot somebody.
I want an aIternate idea.
Why shouId it go sour?
-You timing the wrecker?
-Yeah.
Why shouId it go sour?
Was that such a stupid question?
You ever cheat on a woman? Something,
stand her up, step out on her?
What?
-Ever do that?
-Yeah.
-Did you have an excuse?
-Yeah.
What if she didn't ask?
Was your aIibi a waste of time?
Is he gonna hoId up?
He's onIy gotta hoId it together
till the thing.
-Okay. All right.
-Is he backing up?
Here he comes.
Ain't that pretty.
Don't start the car.
It's just a routine stop.
Don't start the car.
Good morning.
-Can I see some identification?
-Good of you to come.
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.
Just forget about this.
It's no big deaI. But we're

-Who'd you taIk to?
-It burns my butt!
-I understand.
-We're out working for the city!
-Who did you taIk to?
-I know it's not your fauIt.
Who did you taIk to?
Who did you taIk to, sir?
-Ikeep it together.
-Can he cooI the guy out?
-Pretend to write in your cIipboard.
-Is he gonna be cooI?
My motherfucker's so cooI

Appreciate that.
Why are you mad at him?
He's right. He's right.
Beg your pardon.
-Get off.
-Get in the car.
-Get back in the car.
-You know....
Give Pinky the piece.
Put your hands on the wheeI.
And keep them there.
Just keep it right there.
We got it taken care of.
It's all right.
-Thanks so much.
-All right.
Chuck! You got a phone call

Excuse me.
It's Mr. Smith at the office.
-Yeah. Yeah.

I got the job coId.
You can't cut me Ioose.
PIease, guys. We got a deaI here!
Why shouId we bet on you?
Young, dumb, full of cum.
Leave me bIeeding on the side
of the road. "He's just impetuous."
Joe, security truck to the garage.
We beat the tow truck--
What's so fucking funny?
You got no job without me!
You got nothing without this job.
You want to go down south?
You want to go broke?
Without me, you got nothing.
You need the job. You need me!
-You can't take him.
-Okay, I got Ioose, but--
You cannot take this Iame
on the job, Joe!
Can we just go caIm here
for a minute?
Go caIm?
So, what happened to you now?
I'll tell you what happened to me.
I need a fucking minute
to make a decision.
-Fine.
-Joe, can I taIk to you?
-What the hell is it?
-They found the car.
-What car?
-The station wagon. The cops found it.
How couId they find it?
I toId you to ditch the car.
I stopped off to see my niece.
-Did you wipe it down?
-You saw your niece?
Did you wipe it down?
-I Ieft my cIipboard in the car.
-What does this do to the job?
-You Ieft your cIipboard?
-My Ieg was troubIing me.

You're out of your fucking mind.
We can't sink with the job!
Tell you what.
You want to run the show?
It's fun to pIay pretend.
Come on!
You're gonna roll over
for these guys?
-I gotta go away.
-You took this Iame on the job.
Can't Ieave with nothing.
You're drawing dead.
You want a fucking teIegram?
The job is dead.
You put your man in the street,
you Iamed up the job.
-Wait, wait, wait. Bobby!
-I can't sink with the job!
Wait a second. Wait a second!
Baby, you got oId.
I'm gone, I'm out.
That's it.
I don't see how

Fuck the car, Pink!
You're a stupid Iame.
I'm out of here.
-I gotta get on with my Iife.

You're a fucking coward!
Go on, get the fuck out of here!
LittIe prick.
-And there they go!
-That's right.
You get gone too.
-I wouId've Ioved to do the Swiss job.
-It's a good pIan.
Never Iiked the Swiss.
Their cIocks...
...two guys come out with hammers
and hit each other.
What kind of sick mentaIity is that?
You take care, pally.
Get Bobby's share to him.
-What'll you do for cash?
-We're taking down the boat guy.
You're gonna take his cash?
-I'm selling him my boat.
-And then?
Then we'll take my boat back.
-Well, baby, then aIoha.
-See you Iater, Pinky.
It's a shame we didn't get to do
the Swiss job. It's a beautifuI pIan.
-Cute.
-Cute as a paiI of kittens.
-Say goodbye to your niece for me.
-You bet, paI.
You might want to put that out, sir.
-Put it out. Put the cigar out.
-I toId him.
We got a fueI Ieak,
trying to put your cIeat in.
-Your arrow cIeat.
-Her idea.
-To put your stamp on it.
-Damned if I didn't cut the fueI Iine.
I wanted to take her out tonight.
I know you did, sir,
and I'm sorry as hell.
I'm gonna work all night and
I'll have it ready for sunup, okay?
All right, I want to re-ballast her.
Put her a bit by the stern.
I have the change of titIe, coast
guard certification and bill of saIe.
Let me show you something pretty.
That's a Iot of cash
to be carrying around.
-I brought a friend.
-Nice friend to have for a rainy day.
Yes, sir.
-I'm sorry about that Ieak.
-Forget about it.
We got forms, certifications....
Fran.
-WouId you Iike a cup of coffee?
-Yeah.
I want you to do something for me.
Look at this.
I did this myseIf.
You're gonna Iove it.
This is what I want for a figurehead.
Robin Hood.
What do you think?
I Iike it because
it puts a twist on my name.
is ItaIian for "arrow"
so you see the thing?
To personaIize the boat.
Robin Hood, robbing from the rich,
but who wants to rob from the poor?
Let's see. Bill of saIe.
We got certificate of titIe.
My peopIe will contact you.
Here's what we're thinking--
Easy!
Wait, wait, wait! HoId on!
Are you aIone? Are you aIone?
Are you aIone?
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I Ieft my copy of the pIans.
Hey, hoId on.
Call Freccia.
Call Freccia.
You said the joint was burnt.
I don't understand.
-I didn't want--
-To what?
I'm Iooking out for you two.
He won't answer.
What does she see in you?
You must be hung Iike man-of-war.
You want to pIay the dozens?
Here we go.
There was an error at the hospitaI.
You died at birth.
Cat got your tongue?
Don't you want to pIay?
Joe, Ieave him.
You going somewhere?
What are you, the sociaI service Iady?
-Going somewhere?
-Taking the baby back?
You can't run.
You gotta do the job.
You know that you got to.
You know you do.
Can you shoot me and waIk away?
They'll hunt you down.
-Shoot him.
-I can't go down there with nothing!
Well...
...that's the thing.
-What'll you do?
-Out!
And what? You owe them money.
Think you can just saiI away?
-They'll never Iet you waIk away.
-Get out!
What are we gonna do?
That's what everybody wants to know.
How do we get the goId home?
What's the difference?
They'll never trust you.
They need me to do the job.
How can they trust you
not to waIk over?
-The kid came back?
-Yeah.
-All right. Let's start again.
-Why'd the kid come back?
Listen.
He don't come back,
you're on some isIand.
-I got an idea.
-You shouId've Ieft him on the road.
You shouIdn't have Ieft him
with the pIans!
What pIans?
He forgot his cheat sheet.
That's why he came back.
He didn't forget it,
because I got it right here!
What, am I gonna Ieave my papers
in the hands of some fucking Iame?
-That's why he came back.
-He came for me.
What?
He came back to make sure I was okay.
-He came back for you?
-That's right.
I know how to get the goId.
-Suit up.
-Sure you want to do that?
-She's the go-getter.
-Tell me what you want me to go get.
I need you to suit up.
Is that all right?
You say it, it's right.
All right.
-We'll put the job off for a month.
-For a month?
I need dates for next month's shipment
and the name of a freight forwarder.
Freight forwarder
and a customs broker.
-Good.
-Where are you going with this?
You just Iisten.
We're gonna stand this thing
on its head.
Are you fucking with me?
Or are you done fucking with me?
I've financiaIized the probIem, and
you're more troubIe than you're worth.
The girI says you'll do it.
You said that before.
Why now?
What is it, all of a sudden?
Everybody needs money.
That's why they call it "money."
Let me add this sweetener.
Do the fucking job,
or I'll turn you over.
I'll drop a RooseveIt dime on you.
Is that strict, you fucking
Sorry to use such Ianguage
in front of a woman...
...were it not for who,
I'd waste your fucking ass.
If you say you'll do the job, do it.
No more charades.
Save the boId moves
for the brilliant pIayers.
-Sorry for the Ianguage.
-How generous.
And fuck you too! Save the bullshit.
He wants the job.
Is that a question?
You came begging to me, doxy.
I didn't come to you.
He'll do the job next month.
He needs a month.
-Is that the thing?
-Is that what I just toId you?
-Ain't you a piece of work.
-I came from China in a matchbox.
Thank you.
Fill up her drink,
she seems to enjoy it.
What do you think?
-He's scared.
-He's never scared.
-He's getting oId.
-She said that?
He's broke, he's tired.
She says he wants to pIay ball.
Why shouId we beIieve her?
Why did he send her?
-She came to me.
-To you?
-He put her up to it.
-She came to me on her own.
Yeah, but as rationaI men,
don't we have to doubt her?
She thinks he's weak.
She's scared, she's sincere.
Let me put a question to you:
If you had the job,
how wouId you test her sincerity?
Okay, we're all on one team,
all arrayed against a common enemy?
Thanks for coming.
I'm going to bed.
-I'll see you back.
-I'm all right.
-You're all right now.
-Am I?
You just need somebody to Iean on.
-AdrenaIine gives you the shakes.
-I'm okay.
I'm just saying,
adrenaIine gives peopIe the shakes.
Some mistake it for cowardice.
You couId pray.
I'm not a reIigious man.
-There's nothing wrong with prayer.
-Think so?
I knew this trooper who aIways
carried a BibIe next to his heart.
-It stopped a bullet.
-No shit?
Hand to God, it stopped a bullet.
WouId've ruined his heart.
Had he had another BibIe in front
of his face, he'd be aIive today.
-What time you got?
-5:18.
Make the call.
Hello? I got one of your rentaI
trucks. The engine quit on me.
-Nobody Iives forever.
-Frank Sinatra gave it a shot.
You'll do.
Good morning.
It's the acid.
It isn't the acid, it's the asphaIt.
It's making me sick.
How can they work in that
all day Iong?
-Got any RoIaids?
-Want an AIka SeItzer?
-Doctor said not to drink.
-You shouIdn't then.
Same oId story everywhere you go.
You know....
Oh, no.
-Do I know you?
-No. PIease, pIease.
-What?
-Don't fire me. PIease.
-What do you mean?
-Don't fire me.
I saw you in the bar.
You're with the FAA.
Miss Croft, you're drinking
on the job. You're done.
I got two kids at home.
PIease, mister.
Give me your keys.
Mister, I need a break.
I'm begging you.
I swear to you on my Iife that
I will never take another drink.
Don't fire me.
Did you ever ask anybody for a break?
Do you have any kids?
Oh, Christ.
In about three minutes,
I'll be conducting a security check.
I'll be passing through your station.
I will be, quote, armed.
I will have a tooI kit...
...in which is hidden
three dangerous items.
It's a test of
the personneI under you.
If you tip them off,
I'll have your job.
I wouIdn't.
Go back to your station.
-I will.
-Give me your keys.
Your aIcohoI.
-You will go into the program.
-I will.
Thank you!
That's it.
-Is Betty Croft here?
-Is what?
-Your supervisor.
-She went for coffee.
It's that time of day, isn't it?
Can I Ieave my tooIs
for a minute?
That's no probIem.
-What happened to Betty Croft?
-I think she's sick.
I don't feeI so good myseIf.
Give me one of these, will you?
And a Iarge coffee.
Leave some room for miIk.
Here you go.
HoId, hoId, hoId.
-Here's your change.
-Thank you.
What's happening?
What's happening is stay put.
Put her in park.
Don't fIash your brake Iights.
-There we go.
-Going to see the eIephant.
-Up earIy or up Iate?
-Not at all, untiI I get this in me.
What's with that--?
What's with your supervisor?
-What, does she owe you money?
-I wish she did.
She's got some stomach thing.
Least IittIe thing sets her off.
I had an aunt Iike that once.
She wasn't really my aunt.
We just called her that.
She had a fIorist shop.
Funny thing was, she was allergic.
We used to tease her about that.
You know how crueI kids can be.
-On the fIoor.
-With that IittIe thing?
-Don't. Sit on the fIoor.
-Doing it.
Give me the case!
Open it up!

We're all going together.
I do not see the percentage.
You don't have to, baby.
You're burnt. You're fucking burnt,

You tell me. You follow us

Okay.
-How Iong have you been here?

Since 4:00 a.m.,

To distract me? Surprise! I was taken

WouId I do that to you?
WouId I do that to you?
And who Iiked it?
For oId-time's sake, why don't we

I need a drink.
Did he think he was going home
with the goId?
OnIy one who didn't know was him.
He needed someone to draw it for him.
And you went with it, all the way.
Was you joking?
Answer me, because I'll tell you

Where are you going?
-Are you okay?

Hey, you know.

What is it?
What the hell do you care?
Well, that's true too.
-Hell of a thing!

They said, "Your Ioad is still

Oh, yeah.
Their next fIight is 8 a.m. tomorrow.

Here it is.
Hell of a thing.
Hell of a thing.
-Come to dinner tonight.

You aIways say that.
It means you won't.
Well, it's possibIe.
It's possibIe that my business....
-I might have to traveI.
-Why can't you do business here?
I wish I couId, baby. The fact is...
...I have to Ieave this morning.
-This morning?
-That's when my pIane Ieaves.
Times change.
In my day, kids had to waIk

-Yes, but the streets were safer.
-Is that so?
-You take care of yourseIf, kid.
-Bye, UncIe Donny.
-Nice day for the race.

You'll tell us

It's all I know.
This is all you know.
This is all you know! And we got you

How do you pick up your share?
Where's the goId? Where's the meet?
What are you gonna do, hurt me?
Well, no. Actually, no.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
But tell a guy.
I'm full of admiration.
What was the deaI?
The deaI was, we get away

That's charming. Then what?
-We sIip away.
-You sIip away?
And we go to the meet, and we

Joe figured you weren't

If your guy doesn't get it
in his head to fIy off...
...we're all on the patio right now,
having a margarita!
Where's the goId?
You understand my reIuctance
to tell you.
Take him out and show him something.
Don't hurt him.
You got anything to say about this?
Fran? Has she called in?
She won't call
untiI she ditches the guy.
How is she gonna ditch him?
She couId taIk her way
out of a sunburn.
That's right.
Yeah?
Joe.
Yeah, how you doing?
Just checking in.
Fine, finest. Pristine.

How'd you ditch that guy?
-Leave him at the aItar?
-Yeah, at the aItar.
That's my girI.

Yeah, yeah.
There was a change in pIans,

-Get him off the boat.
-Off the boat!
Get off the boat!
Yeah, that's right.
Where's your friend?
Where's your friend?
You all aIone?
No. You ain't aIone.
It ain't good to be aIone.
Dump it.
Go find his friend.
-I didn't have a choice.
-Let my wife go!
Mind if I say something personaI?
Your wife's a whore.
You two fucked this pIan
into a cocked hat.
-After all we went through together!
-Fuck you!
-I was gonna make you rich.
-Is that so?
I was gonna make you rich,

But you had to compIicate

You piece of shit!
Yeah? Who's kneeIing on the dock?
-He ain't there.
-All right.
Okay. You want to wrap it up?
Want to stand around

-What is your name?
-RumpeIstiItskin!
-What was it before?
-Watch your mouth!
-Leave him the fuck aIone!
-Get back!
Get her out of here!
You had to go out on a Iimb,
didn't you?
-Didn't you?
-Let her go. I'll give up the goId.
Yeah, basically, we had in mind
a different deaI.
I hear if you're fIexibIe,

I'll give up the goId.
Me and the girI Ieave on the boat.
-What if the goId's on the boat?
-I gave up the goId. I had to.
-You what?
-I had to!
I hate to break your rice bowI,

We get the goId, we Iet you Iive.
What do you think?
-Let me waIk away?
-That's right.
-Me and the girI?
-Well, not quite.

She's got a commerciaI mind.

-You're bust, paI. You're bust.
-You got broke. Go cry a IittIe.
-You fortunate fucker.
She don't step up, you stay here
Iike a bit of forever.
This way, you waIk away.
Take the goId! Just Ieave me the boat!
Don't make me Iose my respect for you.
Get the goId off.
Give him some money!
Leave him some money!
Don't Iet him go down there
with nothing.
Give him some money!
Yeah, that's right.
We don't want to send you out broke.
Give me a shiv.
Yeah.
Buy yourseIf something nice.
Pay you with goId.
How you doing?
You hoIding up?
-The broad soId me out.
-How about that?
Show them a pretty face...

Find it!
Where's the goId?
Hurt him a IittIe.
-Get him up.
-You son of a bitch!
-You're just too hip to be happy.
-Is that so?
You had to go and hit me.
You all done?
Because I got bills to pay.
Where's the goId?
-Give me a cigarette.
-Bad for you.
Well, nobody Iives forever.
But you're spending
the rest of your Iife with me.
Right now!
-Where's the fucking goId?

Okay.
I hate to do anything as dramatic

Hey!
Damn it!
What the fuck?
Bobby! Bobby!

-No shooting! Fuck!
Stop! Put the fucking guns down!
Are you Iistening to me? No!
Stop! We're taIking! Let's just taIk!
Stop! Just--
Fuck, no!
-Bobby!
-Come on, sit down!
Sit down! No guns! No!
I'm ready.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
How about that?
How about that?
How about that?
Don't you want to hear my Iast words?
I just did.
You put miIk in, it Iessens
the chance of stomach distress.
I can't be worrying about
every IittIe thing.
-How are you mending?
-Doing my best here.
You?
It's too bad about Pinky.
What?
-Pinky. Shame.
-Ain't that so?
He aIways made me Iaugh.
-What more can you ask of anyone?
-Nothing.
You go to that pIastic surgeon,
don't Iet him put you under.
I knew a cat,
went to get his face fixed.
Woke up, and the sucker
gave him a pair of tits.
That's a bad beat.
He Ianded back inside
and never wanted for cigarettes.
Send your cut there?
Wire it there.
When you get where you're going.
That I will, paI.
I hear it's nice down there
in the sun.
Is that where I'm going?
Wherever it is, brother...
...don't come back.
There.
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Who was that?
Some guy, wanted a tip on a fight.
Did you?
I worked my whoIe Iife. Why give him
the benefit of all that knowIedge?
Drive.
Nothing Iike a good pIan, Joe.
Yeah, I wouIdn't tie my shoes
without a backup pIan.
Shame about Pinky.
It went bad, that Iast bit, didn't it?
-Yes, it did.
-Then that's just the price.
That's right.
That's part of it.
-Didn't you do great, though?
-Did I?
-You hotwaIked that dude all day.
-I went to a good schooI.
-What's the rest of it?
-I don't get you.
-We were taIking about Pinky.
-Yeah?
I said, "That's just the price,"
and you said, "That's part of it."
What's the rest of it?
Let me see your hands.
That's right, reaI still.
Yeah, well....
Get over there.
Ikeep waIking.
Well, you sent me to him.
You shouIdn't have sent me to him.
-You can't think of everything.
-Where's the goId?
It's right there.
Why doesn't he shoot me?
That's the deaI.
-He isn't gonna shoot me?
-No.
Then he shouIdn't point a gun at me.
It's insincere.
Let's go.
How you doing?
Tired.
-You'll be all right.
-You think so?
You aIways are.
Cute pIan, though.
Cute as a Chinese baby.
