Where is he?
Ben, grab the drugs.
Bobby's at the money.
So my plan, basically.
You came to me,
remember?
Bobby.
Sorry, mate.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Fuck.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby is gone, Jack.
We need to leave now.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie pie.
Come here.
Hi, sweet pie.
I missed you.
You're late.
Now I'm going
to be late.
Someone has been crying
his little head off
all morning.
The bloody
washing machine's broken.
I'm having to wash
everything in the sink.
Speaking of which...
Godmothers babysit,
we buy presents,
we don't do laundry.
Someone's very grumpy.
You got your period?
It's Sushi night,
actually.
You might as well wear
a t-shirt saying,
"hi, I'm ovulating.
Do you want to fuck?"
What's the romance in that?
well, actually,
I'd first go buy
a new washing machine,
but then after that
I'd pay for you
to go private.
How's tom?
He's just spending
every waking minute
at the house.
You're so lucky to have him.
And you're so lucky to have him.
Tom. Tom.
You up there?
What you doing?
Didn't you hear me?
Job I just finished
had a little extra.
Thought you
could use them.
You all right, mate?
I think we're going
to lose the house.
I thought you were
coming along.
Not far enough.
Pumped all the money into it.
Half my budget
went into this
fucking dry rot.
What does Anna say?
I haven't told her, yet.
She only knows half of what
I spent and she's already
freaking out.
We're trying to start a family.
Can't even afford the rent
on our apartment.
Just talk to her, mate.
She'll understand.
Come on.
If you're up for it,
a friend of mine needs some
painting done next week.
Won't pay much, but...
yeah.
Thanks.
It's a good thing
I have a master's degree.
Come in handy.
See you, bud.
Tom Wright?
Yeah.
You're served.
We've got two weeks?
Thanks.
Ben.
Turn it down.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
It's, uh, Sushi night?
No. No.
I never forget
Sushi night.
It's fine.
Nice wine.
It was just
a few quid extra.
A very nice wine.
Of course it's worth it.
Come here.
Sushi night.
How's Julian?
He's... Loud and...
tonight,
yeah?
Someone's going to get pregnant.
Hey.
You okay?
We're going to lose the house.
No.
No.
We're going
to work it out.
Mike just got me
a few days on a good job.
Maybe it's time
we go back.
No.
Tom.
This was my idea.
I promised you a fresh start.
I promised you a place
to start a family.
That was then.
I'm not giving up.
So... You can shut up.
Tonight
is Sushi night.
I'm feeling lucky.
Ben.
No answer.
Tom.
Ben?
I'm coming down.
Ben.
Ben?
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
he was down here
the whole time.
Anna.
What?
What the hell
was Ben doing
with this much cash?
What was he doing
living in our basement
with all this cash?
Well, he was on disability,
and maybe he had
a big settlement
after an accident?
I just don't know
why it wouldn't be
in the bank.
So, what do we do?
Hm?
We call the police.
Yeah?
Anna. Anna.
What?
Wait.
Tom.
Help me.
We shouldn't have
brought this up here.
I know.
You want to help me?
Tom.
Help me now.
I got it.
Answer the door.
Mr. Wright?
Yes.
I'm detective inspector
John halden.
So, Mr. Wright,
what-what is it you do?
Oh.
Yeah.
I used to be,
in Chicago.
I had a small business,
a little crew,
but it fell apart in the crash,
so we moved here
for a fresh start.
We also had
an unfortunate miscarriage
a few years ago, so...
oh, I'm so sorry.
So sorry.
It was a nice
change for us.
So, now I-I do
contracting work
odd jobs and manual labor.
Tom's renovating
a house.
My grandmother
passed a few years ago
and we inherited
the family house,
so I thought I'd fix it up.
Good for you.
So, Mrs. Wright,
how are you, um,
how are you liking London?
Anna, please.
I'm a school teacher
at morningside primary
school.
My wife runs a clinic
just down the street
from there.
My wife, Marie,
isn't one for giving up.
Anyhow...
So, thank you for the tea.
How long have
you been renting
the room downstairs?
Uh, not long.
I mean, we just did it
'cause we needed help
with the rent.
Three months, maybe.
And he always paid by cash.
Did you find this odd?
No, not really, no.
Did he, um,
did he have any visitors?
Uh, he really kept to himself.
I mean, he didn't have much.
No.
He watched
a lot of television.
Yeah, that's true.
Very loud.
Did, um, did you find
anything unusual about him?
When you, um,
when you discovered
the body, did you...
did you find anything else?
Um...
no.
The reason I ask
is because the initial
police report
suggests that he died
of a drug overdose,
and the team downstairs
are just looking
for evidence
that he may
have kept drugs there.
No, we had... I mean,
we had no idea.
Well, it's just, uh...
it's just routine.
For your own safety.
...Late 40's
discovered in the basement
of a flat.
The cause of death
is as yet unknown.
to-to the guys
that gave Julie
the drugs.
I thought Martin
took you off that case.
Is it dangerous?
Still not going
to bring her back, John.
So,
why take the risk?
It might save
someone else's daughter.
We'll call halden
in the morning.
Tom?
Tom?
What are you doing?
We spent our whole lives
being good, right?
And what
has it gotten us?
Nothing.
Tom.
We don't know
where this money
comes from.
This could be really,
really bad money.
I know.
I know.
But what makes money bad?
Not the money.
The people make it bad.
What people do with it.
Now, I'm not saying
we do anything rash.
All I'm saying
is we just wait
and see.
He's been dead a week.
The cops came,
they didn't find anything.
No one's come forward
looking for the money.
Okay?
And if they do,
this will look like Ben hid it.
I say we just hide it
and wait a week.
Two weeks.
All right.
End of the month.
And then
nobody comes,
we just find it again.
Halden, where are
the background checks
on the Scott case?
You wouldn't be wasting time
on the Witkowski case?
I told you to drop it.
The Scott background checks,
on my desk by five.
And this has nothing
to do with Julie?
No, no, no, no.
It's just...
it's just a hunch
I want to follow up on.
If I'm going to break
every law I'm here
to uphold,
I'd rather it was
for a good cause.
Okay.
It has everything
to do with my daughter.
Bank accounts,
inland revenue,
utility bills, mortgage.
From now on, if Thomas
or Anna Wright sneeze,
you'll know about it.
But I warn you,
there's not much money
to follow.
No, not at the moment.
Okay.
You'll keep me posted?
If Martin finds out,
I'll be fired.
Martin's a smug
little prick.
Superintendent tosspot
can go fuck himself.
Hi, this is
tom Wright from the...
how are you?
We were just wondering
I just ask because, uh,
we wanted to know
what do with his things,
his clothes and stuff.
No, no one's come
forward, yet.
Okay.
And, uh,
do you know,
was it officially...
yeah, overdose.
Looks like it was liquid o.
Heroin.
I see.
Wow.
Bye.
Always tried to let him win.
Any game.
Drove mom crazy.
Said Bobby
would never learn
if we did that.
'Course she was right.
Jack and Bobby.
How it came to this?
Mom was a fan.
She also had
high expectations.
Where's cousin Ben?
You know, when you
recommend a guy,
you're tying
his name to yours.
Did you know
he was going
to fuck me?
If you tell me where I find him,
maybe I'll choose
to believe you on that.
Eddie, sir,
could I please
trouble you for a pen?
You done the right thing.
Anna.
Yeah.
I spent some of the money.
What?
the landlord gave us
an eviction notice.
And then we found
the money, and...
I took just enough
to keep the roof
over our heads.
Look, we're in this.
If we don't start paying off
the mortgage, we're going
to lose the house.
How do we do this?
We spend just enough
to stop the bleeding.
We use cash where we can,
and we get Mike
to write an invoice.
You want to bring Mike
into this?
No, it's not like that.
We're not bringing him
into it.
But when I do
a job for him,
he usually pays me cash,
and then writes an invoice.
So, if anyone asks...
What if someone comes
looking for it, tom?
Anna.
Nobody's come.
Nobody's going to come.
And if they do,
who's to say
Ben didn't spend it?
How much are we talking?
Just enough to stay above water.
The mortgage,
credit cards.
Just so we're in the clear.
There's only one problem
that I can think of.
What?
You are going to be
really lonely
when the debt collectors
stop calling.
Hi, this is Anna Wright.
I'm calling to inquire
about an appointment.
Yeah, for an ivf
consultation,
if possible.
Hello.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Halden.
Yeah, what's up?
Not much.
I'm calling
'cause we got a flag.
The Americans?
Yeah.
You were right.
A lot of activity today.
Mr. Wright made
five separate payments.
Cash?
Some cash.
Some money transfers.
Fuck.
We found the liquid o.
What about the cash?
Mr. Wright?
Detective.
It looks like someone
came for Ben's stuff
after all.
Yeah.
Who do you think would do this?
Your tenant crossed
a very bad man.
That man's name
is Jack Witkowski.
So, who called the police?
No one.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, well, why?
Let's go upstairs.
I'm sorry.
It's not back there.
It's in my car.
But I-I-I did just get
an invoice from, um,
Mike Calloway.
This Mike Calloway,
he's a friend of yours?
He is,
but I do a lot
of work with him,
and he owed me on two jobs,
and we got paid upfront
for this other thing
last week.
If you're holding anything back,
you better tell me.
I don't quite understand.
sudden activity
in your bank account,
and now, coincidentally,
a break-in.
I just want to clarify things.
You're welcome.
Hey.
Hey.
Ouch.
Sorry, I have
to take this.
She's been
a little rattled
since Ben died.
No, really, it's fine.
Tom finally got paid
on that big job I was
telling you about.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.
Oh, no,
that's too much.
Sarah, I got to go.
Okay, bye.
So, this Mike Calloway,
he pays you in cash?
Sorry, what are you implying?
I'm implying nothing.
I was inquiring
about the deposit,
and your husband cleared it up.
So, all's good.
The worst part
is behind us,
right, baby?
Yeah.
It's all good.
Yo.
Hey.
Bloody hell.
What?
Quality stuff.
Yeah.
I thought you said
you were going to lose
your house.
Mike.
Can I tell you something?
Hang on.
This is tom Wright.
Sure.
What kind of job?
Okay, I'm interested.
Yeah, I'll come by
with my partner.
Fine, I'll come alone.
Okay.
See you then.
Looks like
we might have
another job.
hill.
Mr. Wright.
Please take a seat.
You can call me tom.
You're mister...
you must forgive me.
English is not
my first language.
Okay.
And you,
you're American, yes?
I live here now.
And you, you just moved
to the area?
I'm expanding my empire.
Tell me, Mr. Wright,
are you a team player?
I-I guess.
Do you want to talk
about the renovations,
mister...
Genghis Khan.
Genghis Khan?
Is that what you said?
Do you know this man?
Uh, genghis Khan, yeah.
I mean,
I've heard of him...
he marched all over the world.
Countries were so afraid
of this man,
they would lay down
their arms when they heard
of his approach.
Do you know what happened
when they did that?
No, I don't know.
Nothing.
Nothing happened.
The great Khan
welcomed them into
his kingdom with open arms.
But those that resisted,
felt his full fury.
He burned the cities,
killed the men,
raped their women,
salted their crops.
Okay.
Um...
I'm sorry, I...
I think I'm probably
not the right guy for this,
so maybe
you should get someone else
for the renovations, okay?
Where I come from,
this would not happen.
But I'm new here, so...
it's not the product
that matters,
it's a question of honor.
So now
I'm burning cities,
I'm salting crops.
And you have housed my enemy.
Oh, I see.
Okay, yes...
have you heard
of Jack Witkowski?
So, here's
my question for you
and your lovely wife, Anna.
What do you mean?
Whose team are you on?
I'm not on anybody's team.
If you're not
on anybody's team,
you are not on my team.
So, whose team are you on?
Detective halden,
it's tom Wright.
I need your help.
Babe, it's me.
Can you give me...
where's my money?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Me and my brother's money.
Are you an idiot,
you fucking cunt?
And he died getting it.
So, you can understand me
wanting it back.
Now, where is it?
I don't know.
Please.
Please.
Where's the money?
So, that's how you want to play.
It's fine with me.
Please...
Please, stop.
Please.
Where's my money?
Please.
Please stop.
Where's my money?
Fuck!
Hm.
Anna.
Anna, no.
Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.
Tom.
The police are coming.
Just stall.
I'm okay.
Oh, my God.
That's enough.
Get up.
Up!
This is what Tommy has.
there's always
a monster guarding it.
Just relax.
Stop.
It's downstairs.
Bullshit.
I looked all over.
I hid it in the window frame.
Tom's lying.
He's afraid that
if he gives you the money,
you're going to kill us.
Fuck.
Where's the fucking money?
Promise me you won't kill us.
No.
One, two...
Stop pissing about.
Which one?
Three, four, five.
This one.
It's this one.
We're in here.
Downstairs.
He's downstairs.
You stole some money
and you spent it,
so you're going
to prison.
Do we need to get a lawyer?
A lawyer won't change that.
Turning it in won't change it
unless you can turn
all of it in.
No, I didn't think so.
And Jack Witkowski
isn't the kind of guy
to forgive and forget.
He'd find a way to get
to you before we could even
bring you to trial.
I've tried to arrest him
for two years.
He's got ties to the police.
Someone who turns
a blind eye to what
he does.
There are some people
in Scotland yard that think
that Jack is doing us a service.
He kills his fair share
of bad people.
They believe
that one in the hand
is worth five in the street.
Think they
can... Control him.
But you don't.
After he's paid off
whichever fucking
corrupt coppers
are protecting him,
he sells his stuff
on the street at cut price.
He targets
young women,
people he thinks he can control.
That's his specialty.
There is a way out of it.
What?
You help me,
I'll help you.
When Jack
comes after you,
we set a trap.
How?
You say he took
your phone.
Yeah.
When he calls,
you agree to take
the money to him.
You want to use us as bait?
No.
All right, wait...
no.
Just... if we-if we do it,
that means we walk.
If I took this
to headquarters,
Jack would get wind of it,
I'd be out of a job,
you two would be dead.
Find somewhere safe for tonight.
Tom.
You know he would've
killed you, right?
Before.
Why didn't you
just show him where
the money was?
Why didn't you
tell me somebody
broke into our house.
I just wanted us
to have a little money
so we wouldn't get evicted,
so we could have...
So we could have a life.
I went to the fertility clinic,
I'm sorry.
I feel so stupid.
Something was wrong with me.
I just...
it's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
All we wanted was a family.
It's him.
Hello?
How can you fuck
on that dirty mattress?
People like you
are so predictable, Tommy.
All right,
you can have your money.
Just leave us alone.
I want to see you
and the money.
When?
Where?
It needs to be in public
for my safety.
And then you leave us alone.
What now?
The, um,
the tracking device
is sewn into the seam.
It's virtually undetectable,
and I can track you
on my phone.
As soon as you see him,
put the bag down
and walk away.
Don't run,
don't look back.
No exceptions,
no heroics,
no nothing.
Just drop and go.
And when we're gone,
you'll arrest him?
Yes, as soon
as he picks up
the bag, it's over,
by which time
you'll be gone
and safe.
You'll be under
constant supervision.
My men will be watching you,
but you won't see them.
All right.
Drop and go.
Okay.
Not if we have back-up.
Bonjour.
Enchantée.
You must be Anna.
I take it Jack Witkowski
paid you a visit.
Yeah.
So, tell me,
Mr. and Mrs. Wright,
what is the plan
you want to speak
to me about?
Where is he?
He'll call us.
Where are you?
You're late.
Don't worry about him.
He's not with us.
Just let him walk by
and you can have your money.
about
Wave to the good
people, Marshall.
I'm talking about that
mangy fuck, halden.
Run.
Drop the bag.
Fuck.
Marshall, you fucking dick,
get the fucking money.
Drop the bag, tom.
Drop the bag.
Drop the bag.
Run.
I know.
They killed him.
I know.
Anna.
What are we going
to do, tom?
We have one place
where we can go.
At least for a few hours.
You broke your word.
Do you think
I would let you play me?
When I find you,
just remember
you brought this
on yourselves.
Would you mind
giving us a minute
in private, Mrs. halden?
Yeah, I was going
to grab a coffee anyway.
What in God's name
were you thinking?
Not only were you wearing
a bulletproof vest,
but you took a firearm
into a public park.
There are children there,
for Christ's sake.
You're an embarrassment.
You should've retired
when your junkie daughter
died.
You rest up, John.
Good news for me is
now I don't have
to pay your pension.
Who's going to pay
your pension, ray?
Scotland yard or guys
like Jack Witkowski?
I wanted to fix the floor
before I showed it to you.
It's a little
different upstairs.
You want to see?
Yeah.
Remember when we started
working on the house
and we'd eat
take-away on the floor?
Yeah.
Remember when I thought
I'd be done in four months?
Remember when I thought
I'd be pregnant in six?
I'm sorry I stopped coming here.
I'm sorry I got lost
in this place.
I never needed the house, tom.
We're going to make it.
Tell me we're going to make it.
It's okay, boo-boo.
I'm coming.
Give me your phone.
Sarah?
You smell so lovely.
Julian's a real peach.
Hello?
You want kids,
don't you, Tommy?
Such a precious gift.
So, hurting little Julian
it's not going
to be easy for me.
He's so smooth.
What's your plan, Tommy?
We're hiding out
in an old house
in west London.
I'll text you
the address
Okay?
No more tricks.
Keep fucking quiet.
Better text Khan.
Yeah.
You really think
he's going to come?
It's all about honor
with that guy.
Sent.
You know they're going
to have guns, right?
Guns are for pussies.
Yeah.
Look who's come
for dinner.
Anna?
Get ready.
This is the perfect place.
For what?
It's in the house.
Safe.
Don't fuck with me.
just as soon
as we get Sarah
and Julian.
She's inside,
with the money.
What the fuck.
Honey, I'm home.
Mrs. Tommy.
The money's up here.
How can I be sure?
I just want Sarah,
I want Julian,
but if you hurt them
or my husband,
I will destroy
all of it.
That's impressive.
I'll get them over.
Now it's your turn.
Well done, sweetheart.
Now the bag.
Jack?
Are you all right?
Sarah!
Sarah!
Go out the ladder.
Oh, God.
Give me Julian.
Give me Julian
Andre?
You must be sacrificed
Does not seem fair.
You are playing with toys
while I am not playing
at all.
You are a worthy adversary.
Ahh!
Anna.
With me is superintendent
ray Martin,
one of the officers
in charge of the case.
Superintendent,
what can you tell us?
We can now confirm
that these tragic events
are directly linked
to a drug turf war
.
Hi.
It's easy to be a hero
when you're writing
your own story.
Uh, the firemen found this.
It's, um...
it's not much,
but, uh, it's yours.
Good luck.
Hm.
What took you so long?
I just had to do one last thing.
All right.
Say goodbye
to this hell hole.
Come on.
So, no more Sushi nights.
