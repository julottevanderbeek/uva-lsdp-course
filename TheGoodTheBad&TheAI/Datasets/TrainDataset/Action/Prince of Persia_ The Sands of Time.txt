there once rose an empire that
stretched from the steppes of China
where the Persian sword went,
order followed.
The Persian king, Sharaman,
ruled with his brother, Nizam,
upon the principles of loyalty
and brotherhood.
The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.
Rejoice!
not until the day he witnessed
a single act of courage
by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.
PERSIAN CAPTAIN: Get out of the way!
Stop!
DASTAN: Stop!
BIS: Help!
Run! Run, Bis! Run!
Stay here.
SOLDIER: Stop him! He's getting away!
DASTAN: Let go of me!
Come here!
In the King's name!
What is your name, boy?
- Dastan, sire.
- And your parents?
Boy!
Brother, take him up.
the King adopted the boy, Dastan,
into his family.
But perhaps there was
something else at work that day,
something beyond
simple understanding,
the day a boy
from the unlikeliest of places became
The fabled Alamut.
Even more stunning than I'd imagined.
Don't be fooled by beauty, Prince Tus.
It's a city like any other.
Soft countries make soft men.
They stoop to treachery
and now must pay for it.
My father's made clear
Alamut's not to be touched.
- Some consider it sacred.
-
But since our wise father isn't here,
the decision rests with me.
I'll have one last council
with my noble uncle
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv and...
Where's Dastan?
Come on! I bet my entire
month's allowance on this!
This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Get in there!
Is that all you got?
Prince Dastan!
Where is Prince Dastan?
Prince Dastan isn't here!
-
- HERALD: Your Highness, please.
Prince Tus has convened a war council.
I'm on my way.
Our finest spy intercepted a caravan
leaving Alamut.
Swords of the best workmanship.
Steel-tipped arrows.
And promise of payment
from the warlord Kosh to Alamut.
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Koshkhan.
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.
Or our soldiers will fall from its walls.
Our orders were to subdue Koshkhan,
not to attack Alamut.
Wise words, little brother.
Words won't stop our enemies
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.
We attack at dawn.
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.
Thoughts to share, Garsiv?
I ride at the head of the Persian army.
Dastan leads a company
of street rabble.
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.
The honour of first blood
should be mine.
Garsiv, your hand is
on your sword again.
- Where it should be!
- Oh, my brothers!
Ever eager.
It's said the princess of Alamut
is a beauty without equal.
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.
There can be no doubt
of your courage, Dastan.
But you're not ready for this.
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.
REGENT: Princess Tamina.
The Persian army, my princess,
has not moved on.
Their faith has little love for any truth
other than its own.
-
- Perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong.
Nor is their aim.
Gather the council.
Tell them I sit in the High Temple.
I must pray.
REGENT: The High Temple?
Alamut hasn't been breached
in a thousand years.
Everything changes with time.
We should know this best of all.
BIS: Remind me why we're disobeying
your brother's orders?
DASTAN: Because Garsiv only knows
how to attack head-on.
It'll be a massacre.
The Alamutians will be busy
with the main gate,
so we'll slip through the side.
Have you been drinking?
That's our way in.
There are two gates.
The outer one's easy.
That gate mechanism is protected
by two manned guard towers.
Yeah, well, there's always a way in, Bis.
You take care of the outer gate,
you leave the impossible one to me.
You know, sire, you won't be happy
till you get us all killed.
Ooh! Wonderful speech, Bis. Rousing.
Sound the alarm!
Hold this.
- Watch your back.
-
PERSIAN OFFICER:
Eastern gate's open.
That's Dastan's man.
He's gotten in. Dastan's done it.
Redeploy to the eastern gate.
Redeploy to the eastern gate!
Come on.
They've breached the eastern gate.
Collapse the passages to the chamber.
Princess.
TAMINA: Go now, everyone.
You know what you must do.
ASOKA: Above all else,
it must be kept safe.
ASOKA: Out of the way!
Silly songs and scented smoke
will do little for you now!
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, eh, Garsiv?
So for once the stories are true.
We know you secretly build weapons
for enemies of Persia.
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.
And what weapons we had,
you overcame.
Our spies say differently.
- GARSIV: You can save a lot of pain...
- All the pain in the world
will not help you find something
that does not exist.
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.
Join hands with Persia's future king.
I'll die first.
That can be arranged.
TAMINA: Don't!
Prince Tus.
Promise me the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.
SOLDIER 1: Hey, the Lion of Persia!
SOLDIER 2: The Lion of Persia!
They're calling you the Lion of Persia.
You've never excelled
at following orders, Dastan.
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No.
No.
No! We have some celebrating to do.
There is, however, tradition.
Since you took the honour
of first assault,
you owe me a gift of homage.
A beautiful dagger.
He delivered you the city
and its princess.
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.
First dispatch has just arrived,
my prince.
Wonderful news.
Your father has interrupted his prayers
at the eastern palace to join us.
No doubt to commend us
on our great victory.
TUS: We had indications
Alamut was arming our enemies.
Indications?
You better have more than indications
to occupy a holy city with my troops!
This  adventure
won't sit with our allies.
Oh, but I suppose
you didn't take that into account.
Don't look to your uncle, boy.
The decision, and its consequences,
rest with me.
I know you're eager to wear the crown,
but trust me when I tell you
you're not yet ready.
No man would know
better than you, Father.
Because your trust is something
I deeply cherish,
I will oversee the search
for weapons myself.
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof of Alamut's treachery.
-
- Whoa!
The third step is the hardest!
Brother! Brother!
We've uncovered signs of tunnels
on the eastern edge of the city.
- Oh!
- I'm on my way there now.
Oh, but you'll miss the banquet!
You and Garsiv can handle Father
in my absence.
- You do have a gift to honour him with?
- Of course!
- Bis, gift!
- What?
It's been momentarily misplaced.
I knew you'd forget.
The prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.
The holiest in the eastern lands.
A gift the King will appreciate.
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favour.
A rare jewel.
Present her to the King for me
this evening, Dastan.
Sure you really want
another wife, brother?
Listen to me, Dastan.
A marriage to the Princess assures me
the loyalty of her people.
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.
If Father doesn't approve our union,
I want you to end her life
with your own hand.
So, I'm escorted by Prince Dastan,
- the Lion of Persia.
- Mmm.
Must feel wonderful
winning such acclaim
for destroying such an innocent city.
Ah! A pleasure to meet you, too,
Princess.
And allow me to offer that if punishing
the enemies of my king is a crime,
then it's one I'll gladly repeat.
Then you are a true prince of Persia.
Brutal, without honour.
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know me, Princess.
Oh! And what more is there?
Wait here with Her Highness.
If you can manage it,
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.
For your own good.
You've eased Father's anger, Uncle.
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the King, Dastan.
As long as you remember your most
important duty, you should do well.
Oh? And what's that?
Making sure his wine glass stays full.
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank
of great Persian warriors.
We missed you, Father.
I was praying for you
and your brothers, Dastan.
Family.
The bond between brothers,
that is the sword
that defends our empire.
And I pray that
that sword remains strong.
I was hoping my actions would spare
our men unnecessary losses.
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan,
acting boldly and courageously
to bring a victory and spare lives.
But a great man
would've stopped the attack
from happening at all. A great man
would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,
no matter who was ordering it.
The boy I saw in that square
was capable of being
more than just good,
but of being great.
Well, in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.
SHARAMAN: Some questioned
the wisdom of my bringing a boy
from the streets into my family.
I saw a boy whose blood wasn't noble,
but whose character was.
A king in spirit.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
May I present
the prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.
What can I grant you in return?
Roham!
May I present Princess Tamina.
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.
In all of my travels,
I have never looked upon
a more beautiful city, Your Highness.
You should have seen it before
your horde of camel-riding illiterates
descended upon it.
Clearly she will make a fine queen.
But Tus already has enough wives.
You, Dastan, might take fewer chances
if such a jewel waited in your chambers.
The Princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.
What say you, Dastan?
Uh...
He plunges into a hundred foes
without thought,
but before marriage
he stands frozen with fear.
And there are those
who say he is not yet wise.
-
- I need a drink.
GARSIV: Stand aside! Out of my way!
Father.
NIZAM: God help us!
The robe is poisoned!
Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!
- Why?
- Somebody help him!
- Seize the murderer!
- Somebody help him!
- BIS: My prince, save yourself!
GARSIV: Seize him!
Move!
Bis!
Bis!
Come with me!
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here.
You're going to need my help.
Come on!
- Close the gate!
- That way!
Close the gate!
DASTAN: Get down!
There! After the murderer!
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!
Aksh, come on!
the whole world grieves at the death
of our beloved king.
That the murder came
at Prince Dastan's hand
I didn't murder my father.
That robe was given to me
by my brother.
Tus did this.
And now he stands to be crowned king.
I didn't kill my father.
I believe you.
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.
But you did.
I promised my brother I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.
Well,
the solution would be to kiss me
and then kill me.
But I have a better solution.
I kill you,
and your problems are solved!
Perhaps we can find another solution.
Well, the solution would be to kiss me,
then kill me.
But I have a better solution.
- No.
- I kill you!
-
-
Give back what you stole, Persian!
Don't!
- Did you see that?
- See what?
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.
Again?
You've used up all the sand!
- What?
-
What is this?
Incredible.
Releasing the sand
turns back time.
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.
He can go back and alter events,
change time,
and no one knows but him.
How much can it unwind?
- Answer me, Princess.
- You destroyed my city!
Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.
It was about this dagger.
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.
With it he could change anything.
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.
He could foresee the blade of a rival.
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.
Greater even than my father.
It was all about this dagger!
TUS: My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice,
and as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.
Meanwhile, I shall strive
to protect our empire,
- TAMINA: What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.
And Aksh is the most famous horse
in the empire.
- This will obscure his tracks.
- Tracks where? Where are you going?
To Avrat, where my father will be buried.
You're wanted for the King's murder
and you're going to
march into his funeral
alongside thousands
of Persian soldiers?
Well, Nizam will be there.
He's the only one I can trust.
He'll see I was set up by Tus.
Step aside, Princess.
Every road to Avrat will be covered
with Persian troops.
I'm not taking roads. I'm going
through the Valley of the Slaves.
No one goes near that wasteland.
It's filled with murdering cutthroats.
So they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide!
- My brother murdered my father
and left his blood on my hands.
If I die trying to set that right,
then so be it.
So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere?
Noble Dastan, abandoning
a helpless woman in the wilderness!
What does your precious honour
have to say about that?
Give me the strength not to kill her.
Mount up. We can't be far behind him.
Without the right sand,
it's just another knife.
Not even very sharp.
This sand, is there more of it?
Of course not.
Well, how can I get some?
Try standing on your head
and holding your breath.
See what you were looking for, Prince?
Start walking.
If you can't prove to your uncle
how the dagger works,
why in the world would he believe you?
It's not your problem, Princess.
You know, you really walk like one.
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,
and actually believing it.
I wasn't born in a palace like you.
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,
where I lived if I fought
and I clawed for it.
Then how did you become a prince?
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...
I don't know. He...
He found me.
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.
What you're looking at
is the walk of a man
who just lost everything.
DASTAN: Welcome to
the Valley of the Slaves, Your Highness.
I'm desperate for a drop of water.
That's more than we have, since you
emptied our canteen hours ago.
I wasn't born of this desert
like you Persians,
all shrivelled and angry.
My constitution is much more delicate.
I think you mean "spoiled."
The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,
and you wouldn't be here.
Ah! A miracle!
I've silenced the Princess!
Tamina?
Tamina?
Can you hear me?
Yes, Dastan, I can hear you.
MAN: Do you know
where you are, Persian?
And yet you enter still?
In the heart of Sudan,
there is a tribe of warriors
known as the Ngbaka.
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.
The Ngbaka are masters
of the throwing knife.
Wielding blades said to have been
blessed by the Creator himself.
Their aim is so murderously accurate
they can decapitate three men
with one strike.
Oh, I wouldn't even bother doing that
if I were you. Do you know why?
This is Seso. He's a Ngbaka.
I had the good fortune of saving his life,
which means that he is now
enduringly indebted to me.
So tell me, Persian,
is there any good reason
why I shouldn't tell Seso
to put his next throw just a little higher?
SHEIKH AMAR: So! This is the one, eh?
Yes! You were right.
She's not bad.
Oh! She could smell a bit better, though.
Still, we have a deal.
Clever princess.
Deal? What deal?
TAMINA: Such a noble prince!
DASTAN: Such a gentle princess!
How taken you were
with my fainting act,
eagerly leaping to assist
the fallen beauty.
Who said
you were a beauty?
There must be a reason
why you can't take your eyes off me.
I...
I don't trust you.
- And you're not my type.
- Ha!
I'm not some desperate slave girl.
I'm actually capable
of voicing my own thoughts!
Yeah, too many for my taste!
SHEIKH AMAR: Oh, yeah.
She'll make a very nice addition.
What do you intend to do with her?
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.
It's hard for me to admit,
but you were right.
I did see what I was looking for.
Dastan, listen to me.
When my uncle sees the power
of this dagger, he'll believe me.
Dastan, I know I haven't been
entirely honest with you.
DASTAN: Oh, but your lies
are so clever.
I am the guardian of a divine covenant.
- That dagger is sacred.
- Oh! Well...
It was being smuggled to safety
when you stole it.
If the dagger gets
into the wrong hands...
I will take care of your knife.
You won't want to miss this.
You don't understand what's at stake!
This is a matter for the gods, not man!
- Your gods, not mine.
- SHEIKH AMAR: Come on!
Come on!
- Ostrich racing?
- Yeah. Every Tuesday and Thursday.
Whatever they lack in beauty,
they make up for in fighting spirit.
And the races are easy to fix.
DASTAN: I've heard all these
terrible stories of this place.
The bloodthirsty slaves
murdering their masters?
That's a good story.
It's well-told, ever-evolving.
Yeah, but, alas, untrue.
But the skeletons that we saw
at the front...
I bought those
from a gypsy in Bukhara.
I crafted our lurid reputation
in order to fend off
the most insidious evil
that's been lurking
this forsaken country of ours.
You know what I'm talking about?
Taxes.
And all these Persians
with their armies, their fortresses,
their roads.
Who pays for it all, eh?
The small businessman!
See, that's why I started
a little campaign
to spread some false notoriety.
I spread it like a venerable disease
in a Turkish harem.
Behold the mighty ostrich!
Come on, my beauty!
Oh, I love this!
And the tax collectors steer clear of me
and my customers.
Everybody's happy.
- Uh...
- Hey! Get the girls on!
Get the girls on! Come on!
Crowd control!
Don't just stand there! Run, don't walk!
If you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages!
Now, don't look at me like that.
You know what I'm talking about!
Do your job! Crowd control! Thank you!
You know, I think our little arrangement
is gonna work out very well, young man.
- Don't touch!
-
She's a lively one!
Where did you find her?
In the slave markets of Lur.
I was headed to Iraq
to trade her for a camel
- when she attacked me.
- Mmm.
Mmm. The camels are safer.
Noble Sheikh Amar,
I appreciate your hospitality.
You run a fine establishment,
but if you could give me
the supplies that we...
You know something, Persian?
You bear a remarkable resemblance
to the disgraced prince
who fled after murdering the King.
Whoa.
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?
- Yes, you have.
- Yeah. Nothing beats a good story, eh?
But yours, however,
trading her in for a camel?
Please! I mean, look at her.
She's worth at least two.
And as for you, young man,
did you know your brother's offered
a reward for you
which, quite frankly, between you
and me, borders on the obscene?
I'd trade in my own mother
for that kind of gold.
What? You didn't know
what she was like.
Take him down to the Persian outpost.
Wait, wait, wait. Look. That...
- Nice knife.
- SHEIKH AMAR: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's nothing.
- No, look, that's worthless!
- Really?
Melt it down for the jewels.
- Whoa!
- What's the boy doing?
No, you might kill a bird!
Hey! Over here!
Whoa, whoa!
I wouldn't do that if I were you!
Get to the tunnel!
Oh, look at this! That's it!
No more fermented goat's milk
after the third race! You hear me?
Get after him! Come on!
- The gate!
- Get him!
Stop!
Lift the lever! It'll open the gate!
- Give me the dagger!
- What? You're...
This is not the time! Just lift that lever!
Give me the dagger!
-
-
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.
Move, Princess!
Persian!
Dastan!
Persian!
Looking for this? Key? Huh?
Oops!
Next time, you!
They've all come for my father's funeral.
TAMINA: There are 100 Persian soldiers
watching that gate.
Maybe more.
If you want to stay close to this dagger,
you're going to have
to help me into Avrat.
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you know a few.
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?
The Mughals of the Hindu Kush
are a noble people.
You should be honoured.
Oh, yes. Terribly.
Dastan, where's the dagger?
You're welcome to search me for it.
You'll have to be very thorough.
Tus isn't here.
He must still be in Alamut.
The sand that fuels the dagger,
there's more of it hidden
somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?
That's why Tus stays there.
That's what he's got our army
searching for.
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.
That's impossible.
Difficult, not impossible.
Or more proof you're insane.
Then why do you look so impressed?
Out of the way! Make way!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Turn around.
- What?
Turn around!
You used to buy those for me
when I was a boy.
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.
You should not have
brought me here, Dastan.
I had no choice, Uncle.
Follow me.
I didn't kill Father.
You know I would never do
such a thing.
Your actions speak otherwise.
But I had no choice but to flee.
Tus gave me that cloak.
- He was the one who poisoned it.
- Dastan.
Well, he's not here, is he?
At his father's funeral.
Instead, he remains in Alamut.
Our allies will see our invasion was just.
The search for
Alamut's weapons forges is important.
Yes, but not if there are none.
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.
Tus is after power.
That's why he murdered Father.
And now he searches not for weapons,
but for the sand
that fuels a mystical device.
This is why you brought me here,
Dastan? Mystical devices?
Do you remember, after the battle,
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?
Mmm-hmm.
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.
This dagger, you have it with you?
Yes.
It has incredible powers.
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?
What? No, it was in there.
Then where's your so-called evidence?
Tamina.
I...
Your hands are burned.
Yes.
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.
It's just that, uh,
Tus is my brother.
How could he betray me like this?
I can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he
never respected you as you deserve,
only saw you as someone he could use.
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?
My service to your father was different.
We shared the same blood, Dastan.
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?
- That was his favourite story.
- One of many, yes.
-
- No, that was his favourite.
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.
Wait! Dastan!
Over here!
GARSIV: Murderer!
I didn't kill Father!
DASTAN: Out of the way!
Get out of the way!
