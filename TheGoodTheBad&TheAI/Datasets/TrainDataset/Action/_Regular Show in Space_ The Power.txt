Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance
to take back what you said about my mom!
I'll kill you!
Tag up! Tag up!
What?!
Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?
I think he wants me to put the hurt on him!
I think he wants you to put the hurt on him!
You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?!
Yes, I do!
Did you see how awesome it was
when I hit the trampoline?
Yeah, I did!
But it wasn't as awesome as
when you punched that hole in the wall!
I can't believe I listened to you!
I knew I should've got out to do some work,
but no. Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!
But it WAS fun!
Well, yeah. But, now there's a big hole in the wall!
Dude, we're 23 years old,
we shouldn't be busting holes in walls.
We're gonna get fired for this!
You mean, YOU'RE gonna get fired for this.
What?
You're the one who threw me too hard, ya hole!
Don't call me a hole! You're the hole,
you're the one who wanted to wrestle!
Let's not blame anyone! Now,
how in the "h" are we gonna fix this "s"?
I don't know man.
We can't fix it, and we definitely can't
pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money!
Unless, you have some money.
No. Besides, I don't even know
how much it costs to fix a hole like this.
Probably a ton.
Exactly.
Which leaves us with only ONE possible solution:
We convince Benson to give us raises
so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.
Dude...you are a GENIUS!
Of COURSE raises!
-Okay, dude, here's-
-Let me stop you there
because I already know what you're going to say!
HAAAAMBONING.
What?
No, man! Stop it!
We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all the-
No, no, NO, that's not gonna work!
What are you, 65?
"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"
COME ON!
I'm telling you, dude! HAAAMBONIIIING.
Noooooo.
Hamboning will save your LIFE someday!
It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?
No! We're not doing that, okay?
OKAY?!
Fine...
I know what to do!
Are you ready for raises?
How did you get that?
I have my methods.
I don't know, dude.
How's that gonna get us raises?
Aw, come on, man! Look.
Just come check it out.
This is the answer to ALL our problems.
Have you named her yet?
Actually, I thought YOU could do the honors.
Really?
Ya know, I've always wanted to
date a girl named: The Power.
The Power?
I like it.
Cool...!
Alright, this time with feeling.
Ready?
Give us a raise, loser!
Hey, it's Pops.
Hello.
Hey Pops, what's up?
Is that the sound of music I hear?
Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.
I don't know,
Pops is kind of weird.
Exactly.
At least we can test it out on him,
and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work.
Ok.
But let's not call him a loser.
Why not?
He's sensitive.
I don't want him to cry,
I just want him to give us a raise.
Ok, let's do it.
Hey Pops! Check it.
Give us a raise, Pops!
Good show,
jolly good show!
A pay increase, yes yes of course.
Just let me get my billfold.
Butterscotch Ripple?
Dude, I think that just worked.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird
he might have given us actual money.
Totally.
Hey, Benson.
What are you doing?
Give us a raise, loser.
You know, you guys have been working harder.
I think you deserve a raise.
We can negotiate your new rates later in the week,
but for now,
how's 20 bucks sound?
Keep up the good work.
Do you realize what this means?
We can fix the hole?
No,
No, we can do everything we ever wanted!
You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did.
What, the flying or the hole?
What hole?
Dude, get to The Power, he knows.
Knows what?
Nothing Skips,
we were just getting back to work.
Dude, kick it to max power.
Using the Power in your face,
sending you back to your place.
Don't look at our crotches
while we synchronize our watches.
Synchronized.
Go away Skips,
it's time for you to go away.
It's time for you to go your room.
Yeah Skips,
it's time for you to go to the moon.
Where'd he go?
Did you just send Skips to the moon?
-Isn't that what you said?
-No!
room!
I sent him to his room,
not the moon you idiot!
Dude, wish him back.
But it doesn't work that way.
What do you mean?
I can't see him, can I?
Then we have to go get him.
But he's going to be pissed!
Better than him being dead.
Hey, have you two seen Skips?
Rigby sent him to the moon.
Wait, what?
We accidentally sent Skips to the moon with this keyboard
and now we have to get him back.
I love the moon.
Come on,
where's Skips?
Look, we'll show you.
Come on, let's go!
You take forever.
Sorry,
Pops had to go to the bathroom.
Twice.
So what do we do?
Don't worry,
we got it.
Take us to the moon!
Won't you take us to the moon?
Very fun-
What is all this junk?
Um, don't get mad at me guys,
but, uh, I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon
while you guys were in the house.
A bunch of baby ducks,
send 'em to the moon!
Soda machine, that doesn't work,
send 'em to the moon!
You drillbit!
What else did you send?!
Look, it's Skips!
There he is!
Oh great,
it had to be a monster.
What is that?
Rigby, you guys go get Skips.
We'll pick you up.
Ok, ok.
Pops, help me with this.
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Give me a break,
I have to come up with the words you know.
Ok, I got it.
G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...
No!
What?
Dude, I think the batteries just died.
What?!
Hurry up dude!
The batteries are dead!
What?!
Hamboning will save your life someday,
it'll be all like what, you're trying to mug me?
I'm telling ya dude,
hamboning.
I know what to do!
Hold this.
Nooo!
HAMBONING!
I can't believe you just did that.
Use your keyboard!
The batteries are dead.
Play it!
TAKE US HOME!
We did it!
Hey, that's mine!
Nope,
you sent him to the moon
so the least you can do is give him your keyboard,
right Skips?
Right.
And let's have it.
What?
THE 40 DOLLARS YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME
WITH THAT STUPID KEYBOARD CRAP!
I KNOW YOU STILL GOT IT!
NOW GIVE IT BACK!
NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS
OR YOU'RE FIRED!
Can you believe this?!
No!
Dude this sucks!
The hole's still there!
Do you think Benson noticed it?
He won't now!
Dude, you're a genius!
