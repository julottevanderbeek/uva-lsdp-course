Joe, you're under arrest.
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.
Now what're you going to do, Sheriff?.
You can do just about what you want.
Anybody else you want besides Joe?
No.
Give me a hand.
-What is all this?
-Hello, Mr. Wheeler.
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.
Who the devil do you think you're ordering
around here?
First Burdette's men stop me
and now you stand there and try....
-Say, seems like I ought to know you.
-Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.
Yeah, I remember you now.
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachin?
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachon.
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.
You mean sober? You're probably right.
You know what borrachon means?
My Spanish ain't too good.
It means drunk.
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me "Dude."
Now are you going
to tell your men or do l?
I'll tell my men.
Stand by the wagons, everybody!
Pass the word.
Chance, what's going on here?
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.
-Pat, I will tell you.
-What?
-Stop your wagons.
-I give up.
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.
Listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.
-Now, will you please--
-Hey, Chance!
What do you want to do about this outfit?
Do you want to take their guns?
Got any new men with you, Pat?
No, nobody except Colorado here.
-Where'd you take him on?
-Fort Worth.
-What does he do?
-I speak English, Sheriff...
...if you want to ask me.
All right, buster, what do you do?
I'm riding guard.
Pretty young for that, aren't you?
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?.
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?
Rocky Ryan?
That's his boy.
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.
He better be, packing a pair of guns.
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.
I could let you have them both.
They wouldn't do me too much good.
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.
-Stumpy, didn't I tell--
-I know. I'm going. I'm going.
You can keep your guns, Colorado.
Thanks, Sheriff. I don't want any trouble.
Well, then don't start any.
I won't, unless I tell you first.
That's good enough.
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.
I ought to do just that.
-What?
-I'm just guessing, you understand.
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble here.
You're guessing right.
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?
No, I wouldn't.
They could put them over there
by the creek.
Near the Burdette warehouse.
If it's going to blow
that's just as good a place as any.
Show them the way, Dude.
You can go along, Colorado.
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?
Go ahead.
Let's get out of the middle of the street.
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?
We've got Joe Burdette in here.
-Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
-That's right.
What are you holding them for?
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.
-Murder?
-No other word for it.
No wonder this town's in such a mess.
What does Nathan say about this?
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.
You saw part of it.
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.
There are men over there watching us.
They're his.
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.
Who you got helping you?
You met half of them.
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?
Stumpy. You know him.
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?
That's what I got.
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.
Guess I better see they did it.
I'll see you later.
Better get back up there
and watch the road.
You don't look so good.
I feel worse.
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.
I thought you would.
Got some in here. Cold.
Just as long as it's beer.
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.
You'd be in trouble?
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?
Don't you never think of me?
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.
I told you why I want you back in there...
...and you're going to stay there
with that cage locked when I'm not here.
-You hear me?
-I heard you.
Those windows, did you fix them?
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.
Nothing could get in here.
-Not even some fresh air.
-That's the way I want it.
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.
Five, six days breathing the same air
as Burdette might make a killer out of me.
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.
-Shut up!
-I take it back, Joe.
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.
What do you want?
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.
How you holding up, borrachon?
Got the shakes yet?
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.
-Chance, you going to let him do that?
-I'll do better than that.
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him to sleep in it.
Want another beer?
You kind of wasted some of that last one.
No, it wasn't wasted, except I missed him.
-I don't need any more.
-Hey, in the jail.
That's far enough. What do you want?
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.
-You expecting a package?
-Be right out.
-Stumpy?
-Yeah?
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.
If you don't come back,
me and Joe will have us a good cry.
Just keep that door locked.
-Thanks for your trouble.
-No trouble at all.
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.
Looks like our friend's still on the job.
Yeah.
There's another one over by the church.
Any use in arresting them?
For just standing around?
All they'd do is get another one.
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.
Remember that.
Senor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for--
-What you have here?
-The package you've been waiting for.
Just in time.
-Carlos! Where you are?
-I'm over here.
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.
If you break the dishes,
you'll see what happens.
Every day is the same thing.... Carlos.
Oh Senor Chance.
I just ask Carlos if he's....
Carlos, what is wrong?
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.
-What have you been doing?
-What have I been doing?
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.
We have important business.
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.
Consuelo, look at me.
Am I fat?
-I did not say you are fat.
-Please, Consuelo, do not say more.
You already say too much.
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.
Come.
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.
I'm going to see.
You take chances, my friend.
Because I know woman.
If she will be mad or she will be sorry.
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.
You do not have women.
So you do not know.
But me, Carlos Remonte, I know.
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.
If I had bought these myself,
everyone in town would have known.
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.
You see?
Are they not beautiful?
Can you make the picture
how she will look?
You sure you want me to do that?
No.
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a....
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.
What are you doing here?
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.
-Didn't you come in on the stage?
-That's right.
Why aren't you on it?
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?
Chihuahua, I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.
The stage, she did not go.
Why?
-Something happened with the wheel.
-Where's Jake?
Near the corral.
He must fix the wheel before he can leave.
That's just fine.
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.
That ain't no kind of answer.
How or what he'll do, I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.
What I want to know is when.
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?
I'm full of beer.
It doesn't do any good.
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.
Stumpy.
We're going to take a turn
around the town.
-You be all right?
-'Course I'll be all right.
Then get in there where you belong.
I'm going. But you remember one thing:
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.
We'll holler.
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?
Usually do.
Don't want to do anything different,
they might think we're scared.
Aren't we?
I just can't take it sitting in there.
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.
Don't set yourself up as being so special.
Think you invented the hangover.
I could sure take out a patent for this one.
Take that side.
Good evening.
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.
Don't shoot, Sheriff.
Just getting a little air.
I'm getting jumpy.
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.
-Get back over there where you belong.
-Yes, Papa.
-Carlos.
-Senor Chance. I been looking for you.
-It is very bad.
-What's wrong?
-Your friend Senor Wheeler.
-What about him?
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.
He say why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.
He's right.
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.
-You tell him.
-Is he in there?
Si, I think.
Chance, he's over there.
The kings full.
That's good. Beats me.
Spare a minute, Pat?
Good evening, Sheriff.
Deal me out.
Evening.
You two know each other.
Yeah.
No thanks, Carlos.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
You've been talking too much.
-What do you mean "talking too much"?
-Anybody that...
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.
Is that why you haven't asked for
any deputies?
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.
I was talking about why you haven't
asked for any new deputies.
You could get some.
How about my drivers?
You could use them.
Suppose I got them, what would I have?
Some well-meaning amateurs.
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.
Only things they're worried
about is earning their pay.
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.
A lot of people would get hurt.
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.
He isn't worth one of those
that would get killed.
Then what are you going to do?
All you got for help is that old man
down at the jail and this--
Borrachon is the name,
Mr. Wheeler.
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.
Wasn't good, Pat.
Let's sit down.
Yeah, I know.
I shouldn't have said it.
I meant nothing by it.
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...
...without something to hold him up.
How long you been coming here?
Going on two years.
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.
Dude was good.
He was my deputy.
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.
A girl. Just a girl
that came through on the stage.
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.
I tried and he damn near killed me.
Anyway, he was hooked.
Went away with her.
Six months later
he came back without her.
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachon.
-That's Spanish for--
-I know.
He told me.
So, for two years he's been drinking...
...all he could buy, or somebody would buy
for him until last night.
And how long do you think that'll last?
I don't know.
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him.
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.
-Why don't you let me help you?
-You're not good enough.
I don't know! I'm as good--
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?
No thanks, you keep out of it.
That's an idea.
-What?
-Ryan. "Colorado," you call him.
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.
We'll see what he says.
Good evening, Sheriff.
Any luck, kid?
-It's a pretty fast game.
-Son, l...
...asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?.
That's right.
I told him you were one of the best.
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.
That's minding my own business.
No offense, Sheriff.
No offense.
I never expected that.
He showed good sense.
-I'd like to have him.
-I don't see why you--
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.
I appreciate it.
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.
Enough for me for a while.
You leaving?
-Maybe I'll have some luck now.
-Maybe.
If you play your cards right.
Hope you leave some of your luck with me.
I'll come back and give it to you next time.
We'll ante up.
Dude?
Yeah?
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.
Hi, Sheriff.
I'm sorry about those pants.
Carlos told me they weren't yours.
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.
Sure.
Sheriff, what is it?
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.
Three cards short.
Pretty obvious ones, aces.
Why do you tell me?
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.
-And did you talk to him?
-He's still there.
You were leaving.
And I was a winner.
Is that all you've got to go on?
No. Here's a handbill...
...about a gambler they're interested in
catching up with.
You know him?
Says he had a girl with him.
Says the girl's about 22,
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.
Now, the man isn't our...
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.
Yes, I could be.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.
You'd better give me the money you won,
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.
It's pretty easy, isn't it?
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.
But I'm not going to make it that easy.
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.
So, you're going to have to prove
I've got them.
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.
-Search you?
-That's right.
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?
Let's see, the cards could be in my purse...
...but they're not.
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.
-All right, all right.
-I don't wear anything like those red pants.
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?
-That's about enough.
-You have to prove I've got those cards.
-You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
-I'm not so sure.
I think you're embarrassed.
-And if you're not--
-If he's not...
...he ought to be.
What're you doing here?
I don't think she has the cards.
If that's what you're looking for.
How do you know?
The fellow in the checkered vest has them.
Why didn't you find out?
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.
I'm telling you.
I'm going to see if he's got them.
Wait a minute.
-You want to come along?
-I do.
I'm interested, too.
Ace high straight.
Looks like I got the lady's luck.
All right, keep your hands on the table.
Right where they are.
Put your hands back.
Where they were.
Holdout.
He's all yours, Sheriff.
Get up.
Get up!
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.
Carlos, lock him in his room.
Let him out in time for the stage.
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.
Thanks, Colorado.
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.
Is that all, Sheriff?.
I'm not going to apologize,
if that's what you mean.
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?
That's right.
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.
Made a joke of it.
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.
Tell me, Sheriff, what should I have done?
I'd like to know.
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.
I'd like to know what to do about it.
You could quit playing cards...
...wearing feathers.
No, Sheriff.
No, I'm not going to do that.
You see, that's what I'd do...
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.
Dude, you seen Wheeler?
Not since he went up the street.
I think that's him coming now.
Get him out of here.
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.
Got him in the back.
He's dead.
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.
Ain't got many friends like that.
You were smart, Colorado.
-No one's come out of the stable.
-I want to go with you.
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?
-Wouldn't you?
-I wouldn't have let him get shot.
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.
Stay out, we don't need you.
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.
How you going in?
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.
No, there isn't.
I thought so.
I'll let you know when I get there.
Chance, you all right?
Chance, out here.
You all right?
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?
He came out the door, running fast.
-You missed him.
-I couldn't get a good shot.
-Might've winged him.
-Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.
He hasn't got away yet...
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.
-He's still in there.
-How do you know?
Can see both doors from here.
And there ain't any others.
I'm an expert on saloons.
-Get a chance to see who he was?
-No, but we'll know.
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.
You figure we're going in there after him?
-Aren't we?
-We used to.
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.
Maybe more.
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.
I'd like to try--
You'd like to try what?
I been going in the back door.
They haven't been letting me in the front.
Think you're good enough?
I'd like to find out.
So would l.
I'll let you know when I get around back.
Begin with you, Charlie.
That shotgun you keep under the bar.
Pick it up by the barrel.
Easy.
Thought you were going to ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.
Shotgun first.
Set it down.
Back up.
Jim, Pedro, get over there.
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not going to tell you twice.
You're going to stand up
and stand real still.
Now!
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...
...drop them and step back.
Come on.
There's no reason for you to move, Charlie.
What's this all about?
We're looking for a man that ran in here.
Nobody's run in here.
We'll remember you said that.
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.
Who saw a man run in here?
I did.
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.
Clean as a whistle.
Dude, you been seeing things again.
You better have a drink.
Dude.
Maybe this'll help.
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.
Kind of thought you would.
You want that gun, pick it up.
I wish you would.
Stepped in a puddle all right.
It's the fellow we wanted.
I guess this is his.
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.
That's earning money the hard way.
Paid killer.
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?
Nobody paid me.
Nobody!
And nobody run in here, either, huh?
Chance.
I'm not going to hurt him.
Get up!
You're all in it.
The whole lot of you.
You're going to get out of town.
Take your boy here with you.
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.
You can tell anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...
...because they're going to earn it.
Charlie, I want you to....
You finished yet, Dude?
You in a hurry?
Not especially.
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?
-Yeah, Dude, l--
-You want it back?
-Sure.
-You know how to get it?
Yeah.
That's all for me, Chance.
-Charlie, come here.
-Yeah, Sheriff.
You're going with us.
Why pick on me? Why choose me?
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.
All right, back up and give him room.
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?
Why, you're crazy!
And you are, too. What happened?
He was hiding in the loft.
Who got him?
Dude did. One shot.
I wish I could've seen that.
I wish Wheeler could've, too.
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.
He was wrong about Dude, all right.
You were good in there tonight.
Good as you've ever been.
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?
They were laughing at you.
Borrachon talking big.
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.
-Listen to him.
-Don't get too cocksure.
What a stinker! Spit in his eye.
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.
If he were to change, that would worry me.
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.
I could've sure used a drink then.
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.
Chance, nobody please you no how?
You got a light, Stumpy?
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.
Let him in.
Come on in.
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.
Dude did.
Thanks, Dude.
Going to bury him in the morning.
I've just been at the undertaker's with him.
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.
I took out $60 he owed me.
You got yours.
How about the rest?
Did he owe them, too?
Probably did.
Didn't think about that.
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.
-Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?
-That's right.
Meantime, I'm broke.
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...
...l'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.
No offense again, Sheriff.
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun.
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?
I'd say he is.
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I was beginning to think you didn't.
I wanted to talk to you.
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.
No, I was thinking of making one.
I was pretty much of a....
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.
My only excuse is...
...l didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.
I'm going to have a drink. How about you?
Thanks, I'd like one.
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that, too?
Yes, he told me.
How does a man get to be a sheriff?.
Gets lazy.
Gets tired...
...of selling his gun all over...
...decides to sell it in one place.
I'd say you made a poor sale.
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?
She gets married.
-Handbill says he was a cheat.
-He wasn't a cheat then.
That came later after his luck turned.
It was probably my fault he cheated.
He liked to buy me things.
-Then why did you leave him?
-I didn't.
He left me rather suddenly.
He was caught just like that man tonight...
...only his luck had run out.
He was shot.
You've had a rough time.
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.
I liked gambling.
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.
If I had known, it might have been rough.
That's probably why he didn't tell me.
When did this happen?
About four months ago.
Since then I've been working...
...to get enough money for stage fare.
You going home?
I haven't any.
Senor Chance!
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.
But tonight, you will sleep well.
I will watch.
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.
I don't want anybody else helping me.
This is my hotel...
...and you are a guest under my roof.
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do.
-All right, Carlos.
-What you do?
I'll sleep in the jail.
But you can't sleep....
Bueno, senor.
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.
-One thing.
-What?
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.
-But it's not enough.
-Will you?
Bueno, senor. I say no more.
Have a good sleep.
I don't want to meddle in your business.
I'm going to turn in.
If I don't see you in the morning, so long.
So long.
By the way, where are you going?
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.
I know the sheriff that got these out.
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.
Thanks.
Carlos!
Si, senor.
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?
-The girl.
-The girl?
-That one with the feathers.
-What's she got to do with it?
She told me not to wake you.
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.
Sitting outside my room in a chair?
All night long.
She was still there two, three minutes ago.
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you.
You can tell her....
The fool!
Tell her she's a fool?
No! I'll tell her myself.
You tell her she's a fool?
I didn't say I was.
He say, "Not to wake him up. "
She say, "To wake him up. "
Me, I'm in the middle. Ay, Dios.
Who is it?
It's me. The sheriff.
Just a minute.
Come on in.
Hi.
Did you get a good night's sleep?
Who? Me?
Yes, you. There's nobody else in the room.
Carlos had to go and talk.
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?
Fool women.
-Didn't you hear me say that--
-I know.
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.
-Why did you do it?
-You weren't supposed to know.
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?
He didn't wake me up!
Don't blame him, that was my fault.
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.
You got some sleep, I lost some.
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...
...you'd better go on.
I'm going to get some sleep, too.
You can't go to bed now!
I can't?
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.
You've got to get on that stagecoach.
-What'd you say?
-The stage, it leaves in an hour.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I just did!
Then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.
I can't do it if you stand around talking.
You're doing most of the talking.
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.
-Will you just go on and go?
-I'm going.
Then do it, don't talk any more.
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.
So, just go on and let me get on the stage.
Oh, hell! Goodbye.
I just wanted to....
You could have at least let me finish.
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.
I guess I talk too much.
You tell her?
-Tell her what?
-That she's a fool.
She's going on the stage?
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.
I hold you responsible.
Responsible, me?
Yes.
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.
So I see.
There's a lot of people in town today.
Did you hear why?
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.
Most likely they here to watch.
If he does, they may see something.
I don't like it.
Neither do l.
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.
Sure enough.
That's far enough.
I got orders to take your guns.
Suppose we don't want to give them up?
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.
You won't need a gun no more
because you'd be the first man I'd get.
Come on, let's go.
Harris, you're pretty good right there.
Hold it, Harris!
He cut my reins.
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.
Now hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.
Hang up your guns.
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.
Not bad.
How does that happen?
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.
If you mean being sober...
...l'm getting practice on account
of your brother.
I don't follow you.
You don't have to follow me. Matt!
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.
-You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
-All right, Mr. Burdette...
...get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.
You should enjoy it, Dude.
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.
Stumpy!
Burdette and his men are coming in.
Don't put down no red carpet for them.
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.
You do that.
Good morning, Sheriff.
Hello, Burdette.
Been expecting you.
I want to see my brother.
You can come in.
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.
Go on across the street with the others.
Do as he says.
What are all those people doing in town?
I didn't ask.
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.
But I think they're watching to see
what you're going to do.
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.
Now do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?
See my brother.
We're coming in, Stumpy.
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.
All right, Stumpy, open up.
What's the password?
Come on.
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.
Nathan.
Joe.
Looks like they gave you a going over.
Our friend here.
Why?
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.
It wasn't murder.
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?
You knew that already, otherwise you
wouldn't have set things up like you did.
Just what have I done?
You're a rich man, Burdette.
Big ranch.
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.
And you got a brother.
He's no good, but he's your brother.
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.
I don't like that kind of talk.
-You're accusing me--
-Let's get this straight.
You don't like it.
I don't like a lot of things.
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.
What're you going to do about it?
I thought you'd get around to that.
I'm going to sit here
with your brother in my lap...
...until the United States Marshal
gets here.
That'll be about six days.
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.
Now I'm running out of breath.
You talk if you want to.
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...
...except for a barfly and a cripple.
-You can get me out of here any--
-Shut up, Joe!
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you.
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.
If any trouble starts around this jail...
...before anybody can get to you,
you're going to get accidentally shot.
I can practical guarantee that.
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.
But it was a lot of country to me.
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.
He's smarter than I thought.
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.
What's the difference?
We'd all be dead by then.
You got anything else you want to say?
Just one thing. Joe has friends.
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.
I want to make that clear.
I'll help you make it clear.
I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.
You made it clear.
All right, Stumpy.
-Nathan.
-Just sit tight, Joe.
Send me a bottle before you leave town.
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.
Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.
-He didn't have much to say, did he?
-No.
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.
Anything they're going to do is...
...planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.
Throwing him with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.
I never thought of that.
-What do you think will happen?
-I don't know.
You can think, can't you? Any man--
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.
Be careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.
I got to fix your supper for you tonight.
Senor Chance.
It's me, Carlos.
Come on in.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you.
Did the girl....
What happened to your eye?
You told me to put the lady on the stage.
She did that? What'd you do?
-She did not do it.
-I thought you said she did.
I say you tell me to put her on the stage.
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.
-I'm a little mixed up.
-Do not talk. I tell you.
-Okay.
-It's better if I tell you.
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage she's ready, but she don't come.
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said, "No."
-I go and get her, she said she don't go.
-Did she go?
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I said that may be.
I pick her up. And Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.
Did she go on the stage?
Consuelo tell me put her down.
I said, "I am responsible."
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.
What'd you do?
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.
Did the girl get on the stage?
No, she did not go!
But Jake says he couldn't wait.
-Why?
-He says he must leave.
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?
Please come and tell Consuelo
what responsible means.
Stumpy, we're going out.
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.
The door's unlocked.
I didn't go.
I can see that.
I don't know...
...l had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.
It was me saying it.
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?.
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.
Chance, John T.
"T" for trouble.
I always make you mad, don't l, John T.?
Then, don't make me tell you why I stayed.
I won't make it any harder for you.
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.
You don't owe me a thing.
And you won't owe me when it's all over.
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.
No, you won't even have to tell me.
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.
Is that fair, John T.?
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.
But just say something.
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.
But I am.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'm glad we tried it a second time.
It's better when two people do it.
I've kept you long enough.
You'd better run along now
and do your job.
