The war between India and Pakistan
had come to an end
the Pakistani army surrendered
to the indian army
there was a new Bangladesh
After the Indian army left...
the 2 boys didn't understand...
whether what happened to them
was good or bad
will the new country give them
new dreams?
they were thinking
move move fast....
when Bangladesh was created
there was 1000's of people
are you hungry? Will you have food to eat?
Will you work for me?
If you give us food...
what ever you say will be done...
Vikram and Bala were the main leaders
no one would suspect
the small boys
Vikram and Bala were Latiff's gun couriers
hey Lattif guns will keep on selling
sometimes think of me too
you said it right
do one thing leave one of the boys here
sir they are kids
dad take Bala, I will stay here
the boy understands...
I said go.....
what will he do with vikram?
I am going to get him, say something
sir I beg you  let me go
put the gun down
I said open his hands
don't come near me
we killed the police
who???????
he was from the army they will
not spare you
a train is going both of you go from here
no one is here
go go go...
try to save your anger
I have cooked something for you
go and have it
its a house and we will have one soon
get out off here
leave me I will break his head
now we will starve to death
wait 1 minute
how much are you selling this charcoal for?
-2 rupees 10kg
its expensive
today the price will go down
lets go bala... where?
the charcoal that saved us will now feed us
do you want to buy charcoal?
-from you ?
we will give 10kg for 1 rupee
put the money in the hand
keep that.
-For what?
We broke the cups
Buy new ones
nice one all balance cleared off
Run!
Wow look over here!
You must see one day I will
drive that car...
What happened brother?
Do you know our names?
Why rob the train?
The train you looted was
Dibakar dada's
Does Dibakar dada belong to the government?
Do not show me your bravery
You will answer for your deed's
One minute!
Can you tell me something?
When will his next train go
Go and tell him we will once again
loot his train...
If he has guts try and stop us.
Who is Dibakar from you all?
It seems you are
because you look angry...
Bastard's you come on my train
and show me your strength...
Is the game over?
This train is mine...
and so is the coal.
Now tell me... whose train is it?
Its mine
This train can never be yours
Ask me why?
Cause you are bangladeshi refugees
Its been a dangerous mission
It was not only about coal
Also about fish
Both have ruled calkutta
They were small time goons
Now they rule entirely...
they are focusing on one thing
We don't know how to read
Vikram bose nice childs play
Names of school and hospital
Was under their control
They only wished for two things
in Calkutta...
Calkutta's biggest goons
There is a story behind a twist.
I am a policeman
I should not have called you
If I had my best officers
Satya, I have pressure from the high post
Election
There is a saying
Bring goons no the right path...
We need to clean the streets
This is the governments job
How can the police help?
You are right
Banerji
So many files
There are only two names to mention
These files has all the evidence
since their childhood
No evidence...
no witness...
Must I insert finger-prints
inside
Were are you going?
If you speak I'll shut you up
Were is your boss?
Where is Vikram and Bala?
Leave the papers over here.
I am the new ACP
Entire Calcutta is ours
Sir,what can I offer you to drink?
This file has all your misdeeds
You need proof or evidence
Witness
We respect the law
The day you have evidence
We will hand ourselves to you
Very nice
Superb
No problem we will take your advice
From today all your files
are dissapeared
I will reopen your files from today
Any witness or evidence
I will remove you like dog's
from your own house
It will be fun
Thanks alot
If you guys come it will be a pleasure
We like to open
It's our hobby
One more request...
He worships you alot
It's not a football team
Don't like football
Ok. I explained to him
You wait right here
Kaka speak up!
Can you do me a favour?
I know this is a gent's toilet...
But what can I do? the ladies was full...
That is why, I came to the gents
I said sorry
But this is wrong
Why?
Is there licence for ladies to enter
gents toilets? Is this a government notice?
Don't act smart...
Do your job
What is this brother?
Bomb
It blew up and went away
Are you done?
What happened?
Did you loose something?
Its not in your luck to find it
Its your luck
The day you drop...
I will pick you up
I am in love with my bathroom story
Two hearts and one love!
Vikram she is a beautful girl
What can we do?
Toss a coin
See who wins the bet
She is looking like a Goddess
She looks 100% Kali maa
Hey you! Come over here
Don't show me your teeth...
What are you doing here?
-Nothing
This is a small gift from me to you
Are you giving me a gift?
A fish
Are you acting smart?
