GET BACK IN YOUR VEHICLE
AND DRIVE

JUST FOR THE GOD DAMN
HELL OF IT!
CAN YOU SHOW ME

SCARS OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SCARS?
WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
IS HISTORICAL FACT.
IT TOOK PLACE A YEAR AFTER
THE GREAT McSWEEN FIRE OF 1878,
WHAT SOME CALL THE END
OF THE LINCOLN COUNTY WAR.
THAT'S HIM.
WHEN THEY ASK
WHO DREW FIRST,
I GOT THE DROP ON HIM.
SAY WHAT YOU WILL.
I FIGURE
TO GET AT LEAST 1OO DOGIES
FOR HIS TRIGGER FINGER.
BOYS!
UH! UH!
WAIT.
DO I KNOW YOU?
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU KNOW ME.
YOU DO.
YEAH.
YEAH.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, NOW...

AH!
UH!
I'D TAKEN UP
WITH ARKANSAS DAVE RUDABAUGH
AND PATRICK FLOYD GARRETT.
ME AND GARRETT
HAD A COMMON INTEREST
IN THE HORSE
AND CATTLE TRADE.
CONTRARY TO WHAT THEY SAY,
I LIKED
THE SON OF A BITCH.
NOW, MOST OF THE BOYS
THAT RAN WITH ME
DURING THAT LITTLE WAR
ARE DEAD OR GONE OR HIDING,
BUT I NEVER LET THEM
PUSH ME OUT.
NEW MEXICO TERRITORY
WAS MY HOME.

TO CLEAN UP.
HE'S GOING THROUGH
THE TERRITORY LIKE THE POX,
RUNNING IN EVERYBODY
WHO FIRED A SHOT
IN THE LINCOLN WAR,
DRAGGING THEM ALL BACK
ACROSS THE WHOLE DAMN COUNTRY.
THlS SAYS,
"GENERALLEW WALLACE
HAS PROCLAlMED A STATE
OF lNSURRECTlON."
THEY'RE FIXING TO DO
A BIG EXTERMINATING,

OF THEIR HANGING LIST.
THEY WANT TO PUT YOU DOWN.

BILLY THE KID?
NAH.
BUTIAM ARKANSAS

PRESBYTERIAN FILTH!

GOOD TO SEE YOU.
"WHEN TROUBLES COME,
"THEY COME
NOT SlNGLE SPlES,
BUT lN BATTALlONS."
JOSIAH G. SCURLOCK.
I NEVER WROTE THAT.
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO TELL YOU.
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
WROTE IT.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
WHAT ABOUT
A DRINK, DOC?
HA HA HA HA!
WHERE'D
THEY CATCH YOU?
SEVEN RAIL DAYS
EAST.
WIFE?
CHILD.
CHAVEZ, WHERE
THE HELL IS HE?
BILLY.
WHOA, WHOA.
HA HA HA HA HA!
HEAVY STEPS, PATSY.
HEY,GRACIAS.
A MESSENGER
CAME THROUGH TOWN TODAY
FROM THE NEW GOVERNOR.
HEE HEE!
HE WANTS TO MEET
WITH YOU.
HE CAN'T CATCH YOU.
YOU'RE MAKING HIM
LOOK A FOOL.
GO ON.
HE WANTS TO TALK TREATY.
YOU'RE BOSHING ME.
HE WANTS YOU
TO TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE
AND TESTIFY.
TESTIFY AGAINST WHO?
AGAINST THE MURPHY BOYS
HE'S GOT IN THAT PIT
IN LINCOLN.
YOU CAN HANG
YOUR OLD ENEMIES, KID.
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
YOU GOT TO SAVE YOUR NECK.
YOU GOT NO PLACE
LEFT TO HIDE.
SO EVERYBODY'S
LOOKING FOR ME.
HMM.
HEY. PAULITA MAXWELL
AROUND?
SHE LOOKING FOR ME?
GETTING KIND OF
LONELY IN HERE.
NO. I DON'T THINK
PAULITA'S LOOKING FOR YOU.
I THINK CELSA BACA'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.
WHOA! CELSA BACA!
YOU GOT TO BEAR GREASE
THE DAMN WALLS
TO GET THAT PIG
IN HERE.
YEAH? THAT'S THE ONLY THING
WE'D HAVE TO BEAR GREASE.
GARRETT!
WELL, GARRETT WAS RIGHT.
I WAS RUNNING OUT
OF PLACES TO HIDE.
AND HERE WAS
GOVERNOR LEW WALLACE,
THE SECOND BEST-KNOWN MAN
IN NEW MEXICO,
PROPOSING TO MAKE A TREATY
WITH ME IN LINCOLN.
THEN WHY GIVE UP THE SANCTUARY
OF A LITTLE VILLAGE
WHERE I WAS PROTECTED
BY MY FRIENDS?
BUENOS DIAS, IGNIO.
#COMO ESTAS?
HOLA, BILLY.
I FOUND HIM! HE'S--
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
'CAUSE $5OO
CUTS A LOT OF TIES.
AH, DAMN IT, IGNIO.
COME ON!
MOVE IN!
ALL RIGHT!
GO AROUND BACK!
AH!
KEEP IT DOWN!
SERGEANT TURNER!
AH! AH! AH! AH! AH!
RIDE, LITTLE CASINO.
COME ON!
GIT, GIT, GIT! WOO!
GO, BILLY!
YOUR EXCELLENCY...
IT'S HIM.
HE'S HERE.
WELL, SHOW HIM IN.
HI.
MR. BONNEY?
I APPRECIATE
YOUR GOOD FAITH.
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M GOVERNOR LEW WALLACE.
EXTRAORDINARY.
I WAS EXPECTING A RATHER ROUGH
AND OLDER FELLOW,
NOT SO SMOOTH OF FACE.
COGNAC, MR. BONNEY?
UH-UH.
WELL, THEN. TO THE POINT.
THE VARIOUS CRIMES COMMITTED
DURING THE LINCOLN CATTLE WAR--
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
IT WAS NO CATTLE WAR.
IT WAS A MERCHANT WAR,
IRISH AGAINST THE ENGLISH.
THEY KILLED MY EMPLOYER,
MR. TUNSTALL,
AND I MADE WAR.
THOSE MEN THAT KILLED
YOUR EMPLOYER,
THE GROUP THAT EVADED
THE REVENGE
OF YOUR SO-CALLED
REGULATORS,
THEY'VE BECOME
A RATHER ROUGH BUNCH
SINCE THIS MERCHANTS' WAR,
CUTTING
PROMINENT RANCHERS' HERDS
LIKE JOHN CHISUM'S.
YES, SIR. THEY HAVE.
AND YOU HAVE, TOO.
HOWEVER...
YOU'RE ONE,
AND THE MURPHY-DOLAN RUSTLERS
ARE MANY.
IF YOU CAN TESTIFY
AGAINST WHAT YOU SAW
IN YOUR LITTLE WAR,
I CAN THEN ELIMINATE
THE MANY.
WELL...
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE?
MY TERMS ARE SIMPLE--
YOUR TESTIMONY AGAINST THOSE
WHO MURDERED YOUR EMPLOYER
IN EXCHANGE FOR LENIENCY.
NO.
MY TESTIMONY IN EXCHANGE
FOR A FULL PARDON.
WELL,
I'M AFRAID THAT'S--
I TESTIFY,
AND I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN
A FREE MAN.
IF NOT,
I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN NOW.
ANY OF YOUR BOYS
TRY TO FOLLOW ME,
THEY'LL WIND UP
IN A PINE BOX.
IF YOU
WERE GIVEN PARDON,
YOU WOULD LEAVE
NEW MEXICO,
NEVER TO RETURN?
YOU GO ON THE STAND
AND HELP ME HANG
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
PARDON.
HA HA HA HA!
OF COURSE,
THE MURPHY BOYS WILL SHOOT YOU
DEAD AS A MANGY DOG
IN THE STREET.
SO WE'LL ARREST YOU,
A STAGED ARREST
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION
BEFORE THE TRIAL.
BUT THAT'S FOR YOU
TO DECIDE.
CAN I HAVE
SOME OF THAT CAKE?
PENDLETON.
UH-UH, PENDLETON.
UH-UH.
THE, UH...
THE WHITE CAKE
WITH THE SWEET FROST.
SO...
SHALL WE PROCLAIM
OUR SECRET PARLEY
A SUCCESS?
IT'S A DEAL.
WHEN THE NECK IS BROKEN,
THERE'S ONLY A SHARP PAIN, FAST.
THEN IF THE OTHER PLACE
ACCEPTS YOU,
THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES.
IT TAKES YOU THERE
TO THE OTHER SIDE.
SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SPIRIT HORSE.
SHE'LL COME FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.
GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CHAVEZ.
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CATCH
A SPIRIT HORSE.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE
THE OTHER SIDE.
I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANNA
HAVE MY NECK BROKE
THROUGH A SHARP, QUICK PAIN.
THE ONLY THING
I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.
ME, TOO.
WELL DONE, WILLIAM.
SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
THREE CANDLES LEFT
AND ONLY TWO BULLETS.
SPLENDID, SPLENDID!
WHAT DID I SAY?
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
MR. BONNEY...
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RYNERSON'S
HERE TO SEE YOU.
THE GOVERNOR
THINKS IT'S BEST
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR RESTRAINTS ON.
HEY, SHERIFF?
CAN YOU BRING THAT
FIDDLE PLAYER IN AGAIN?
HE WAS QUITE GOOD.
HOW ABOUT SOME MORE CAKE
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?
AND IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE NIPPY IN HERE.
COULD YOU STOKE UP
THAT FIRE?
THANKS, GEORGE.
YES, SIR.
I WAS STARTING TO GROW FOND
OF PRISON LIFE.
TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU, MR. BONNEY.
FINALLY IN CHAINS,
ARE YOU?
STILL TRYING TO
KEEP UP YOUR GAME?
WELL,
WE'LL BE SEEING YOU
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE COURTS VERY SOON.
I AIN'T BEING TRIED.
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST DOLAN
AND ALL THE OTHER SWINE
WHO KILLED MY FRIEND
JOHN TUNSTALL. YES, SIR.
ARE THE BLOODY COCKS
STILL RUNNING THE COOP?
AH, TO BE SURE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HA HA HA!
HMM.
WHO GIVES TESTIMONY
IS STRICTLY
WITHIN THE DISCRETION
OF THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY,
WHO HAPPENS TO BE ME,
WHO HAPPENS TO THINK
NOT A BLOODY CHANCE
IN THE PIT OF HADES.
UGH!
YOU CAN'T BLUFF ME.
NO.
I'LL CHARGE YOU,
SENTENCE YOU.
I WILLHANG YOU...
BUT I'D NEVER
BLUFF YOU.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
THE GOVERNOR'S ON HIS WAY
BACK TO SANTA FE NOW.
PARDON BILLY THE KID!
IMPOSSIBLE!
I SHOULD HAVE DUSTED
HIS EXCELLENCY'S REGAL ASS
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
LIE TO ME.
HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER
AGAINST THE IRISH POLITICIANS
WHO WERE STILL RUNNING
LINCOLN COUNTY.
GOOD DAY, MR. BONNEY.
GOOD DAY, MR. DUNG PILE.
HA HA HA!
AIN'T THAT A BEAUT?
HA HA HA!
ANOTHER HISTORICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL FACT
WAS THAT
I HAD SMALL HANDS
AND BIG WRISTS.
AND THAT HAS SAVED MY LIFE
MORE TIMES
THAN COLONEL COLT'S EQUALIZER.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING
NEAR TO SUPPER TIME.
YOU BOYS HUNGRY?
I GOT TWO LOTS
OF NEWS FOR YOU--
GOOD AND BAD.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BAD NEWS FIRST.
ALL WE GOT FOR SUPPER
IS HORSESHIT.
HA HA HA HA!
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE GOOD NEWS?
Scurlock:
THERE'S TONS OF IT.
THE WORLD HATES
A SMART MOUTH, SCURLOCK.
OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING
TO REALIZE THAT TOMORROW
WHEN YOU SWING
FROM THAT GALLOWS.
HEE HEE!
THAT'S IF THE LYNCH MOB
DON'T COME FOR YOU FIRST,
WHICH I HEAR TELL
THEY INTEND TO DO.
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU BOYS WANT SOME DESSERT.
HA HA HA HA!
HOWDY, BELL.
EVENING.
HOWDY, BOYS.
HEE HEE HEE!
IF THEY STICK THEIR
FINGERS UP AGAIN,
I'LL BLOW THEM OFF
LIKE I DID YOURS,
EH, MOFFAT?
IF THERE WAS ONE THING
AN OUTLAW FEARED
IN THE NEW MEXICO TERRITORY,
IT WAS LYNCH-MOB JUSTICE.
RIGHT ON TIME.
WITH NO PATIENCE FOR COURTS
AND TRIALS,
THEY DID IT
THEIR OWN WAY,
AND THERE
WAS NO STOPPING THEM,
MAINLY 'CAUSE
THE SO-CALLED LAW...
HOWDY.
HAD NO DAMN INTENTIONS
OF STOPPING THEM.
YOU'RE A BIT LATE.
VIGILANTES!
JEEZ! IT'S THE LYNCH MOB!
KID'S ESCAPED,
THE LITTLE WEASEL.
OH, I'M SURE HE DID,
MISTER.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
OPEN THE PIT.
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
NO BILLY THE KID
IN THERE.
IT'S TRUE! HE'S GONE!
WE MIGHT
AS WELL GO.
WE GOT SOME OF HIS
REGULATORS THERE--
THE INDIAN
AND TENDERFOOT
RODE WITH THE KID
ON THE TUNSTALL-
McSWEEN SIDE.
HOW'D THEY BE?
AW, SHIT.
THEY'LL HAVE TO DO.
BRING THEM UP.
HA HA HA HA!
PICK YOUR TREE, BREED.
STOP!
I ORDER YOU AS A PEACE OFFICER
OF LINCOLN COUNTY!
HA HA HA HA!
GENTLEMEN, I'M A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK,
AND THE BREED BACK THERE,
WELL, HE'S MY GUIDE,
AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO MAKE AN ENORMOUS ERROR.
WE KNOW YOU RODE
WITH THE BOY- DEVIL,
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HANG FOR IT.
I SWEAR TO YOU. I NEVER
EVEN LAID EYES ON HIM.
I WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK!
"I'M A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE ClTY OF NEW YORK!"
HA HA HA!
HOWDY, DOC.
HOW ARE YOUR DRAWERS?
NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, BILLY.
IT'S THE KID!
COME ON!
LET'S GET OUT!

A LOT OF BOYS
RIDING WITH YOU
THESE DAYS.

HA! HA!
YAH!
YAH YAH!
YAH! GIT, GIT, GIT!
WOO!

YAH! YAH!

WHERE'D THEY GO?
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY WENT OVER THAT WAY!
HEE HEE HA!
WOO!
UGH!
UH!
YAAAH!
I THINK
WE'VE GOT HIM!
AH!
HEY! HEY!
HURRY!
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!
COME ON!
HOLD STILL NOW.
GOT THIS BUCKSHOT INFECTION
IN MY ELBOW.
MAKES MY RIGHT ARM
KIND OF...WHOA!
HOLD STILL NOW.
IAMSTILL.
JUST SHOOT
THE CHAIN, OK?
GOD DAMN.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, DOC.
I KNEW
YOU'D COME BACK.
WE MADE A PACT,
REMEMBER?
YOU, ME, AND CHAVEZ.
PALS FOREVER.
BILLY,
THE CHAINS.
LOOK. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GUYS
SWAPPED SPITTLE AND PISSED
IN EACH OTHER'S BOOTS.
I DON'T TAKE TO TENDERFOOTS
IN MY GANG,
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T TAKE
TO NO MEXICANS.
IT AIN'T YOUR GANG,
DAVE.
MEXICAN-INDIAN,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
OH! I'M SORRY!
HEY, TELL ME SOMETHING,
CHAVEZ.
WAS IT THE SAVAGES PUTTING IT
TO A MEXICAN WHORE,
OR WAS IT AN INDIAN WHORE
PUTTING IT TO
THE WHOLE GOD DAMN MEXICAN ARMY?
HO, HO, HO!
GOD DAMN IT.
REMEMBER SOMETHING,
DAVE.
THESE BOYS
ARE THE LINCOLN COUNTY
REGULATORS.
YEAH. WAS.
WERE.
BILLY, COME ON.
THE CHAIN.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DOC.
WERE.
THERE AIN'T NO REGULATORS
NO MORE.
NO ROOM FOR THEM.
NO ROOM FOR ME.
BILLY, PLEASE.
I'M TAKING
THE MEXICAN BLACKBIRD.
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING?
THE BROKEN TRAIL
THAT GO DOWN TO OLD MEXICO.
ONLY ME AND A FEW OTHER BOYS
KNOW IT.
TAKE THE TRAIL BELOW.
HEY, DOC...
ONCE YOU'RE DOWN THERE,
THESE BASKET MEN,
PAY THEM,
AND THEY'LL COME UP
AND GET YOUR BELONGINGS,
YOUR FAMILY,
WHATEVER YOU NEED.
COME HERE, BILLY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHOOT THE CHAIN, OK?
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN HERE.
MOUNT UP.
WE'RE TAKING
THE MEXICAN BLACKBIRD, HUH?
OLD MEXICO. LET'S GO.
COME ON.
WHERE'D
YOU FIND HIM?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S FROM NEW YORK.
IT'S FOR THE HORSE.
THAT HORSE
AIN'T FOR SALE, DOC,
BUT, UH...
HOW ABOUT MY BOOTS?
THEY'RE NICE
AND BROKE AND--
SON OF A BITCH!
WOO HOO HOO!
COME ON, BILLY.
KILL THAT TENDERFOOT
SON OF A BITCH!
GET ON TOP OF HIM!
COME ON!
COME ON. BREAK IT UP, BILLY!
I KNOW YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU KNOW ME, HUH?
WELL, I KNOW YOU!
YOU KILLED HALF THE MEN
I GOT CREDIT FOR.
I SAW YOU WITH BLOOD
ALL OVER YOURSELF.
I SAW YOU KILL!
JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT
BACK EAST AND MARRIED,
PUT ON A SILK CRAVAT,
THAT DON'T CHANGE
WHAT YOU DID!
DAMN IT, CHAVEZ!
LET ME HAVE--
YOU REMEMBER
JOHN TUNSTALL?
REMEMBER THE STORIES
HE'D TELL US
ABOUT THE THREE CHINAMEN
PLAYING FAN-TAN?
SOMEONE RUNS UP TO THEM
AND SAYS, "HEY!
THE WORLD lS COMlNG
TO AN END."
AND THE FIRST ONE SAYS,
"WELL, I BEST GO
TO THE MlSSlON AND PRAY."
AND THE SECOND ONE SAYS,
"WELL, HELL!
I'M GOlNG TO GO BUY ME A CASE
OF MESCAL AND SlX WHORES."
AND THE THlRD ONE SAYS,
"WELL, I SHALL FlNlSH THE GAME."
I SHALL FINISH THE GAME, DOC.
WHOEVER'S GOING FOR OLD MEXICO,
WE RIDE NOW.
JOSIAH, THIS AIN'T
THE UNTAMED PRAIRIE
YOU USED TO
RUN FREE OVER.
I GOT A FAMILY
I GOT TO GET BACK TO, PAT.
THE NEW GOVERNOR WAS
THE GENERAL AT SHILOH...
HE'S GOT MILITIA,
HE'S GOT ARMY,
HE'S GOT MONEY
TO PAY GLORY HUNTERS
TO RUN YOU
DAY AND NIGHT,
AND THEY'RE
ON THEIR WAY,
AND THEY WILL
KILL YOU, DOC.
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, PAT.
THEY'LL
CATCH YOU, DOC,
AND CATCH ME.
EVERYBODY BUT HIM.
THE VILLAGERS SAY
HE'S ADIABLERO.
HE CAN CHANGE
INTO A COYOTE,
DISAPPEAR, AND NEVER
GETS KILLED.
ME?
I JUST THINK
HE'S THE LUCKIEST
WHITE EYE IN NEW MEXICO.
BUT HE'LL CROSS
THE BORDER.
HE WILL.
CHAVEZ, I CAN'T RIDE
WITH HIM ANYMORE.
TRYING TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR
FORGETTING ABOUT HIM.
READ ABOUT HIM
IN THE NEWSPAPER
AND THEM DAMN
FIVE- CENT BOOKS.
JESUS CHRIST,
THE CHILDREN
IN NEW YORK CITY
IMITATE HIM
IN THE STREETS.
HE'S IN MY SLEEP.
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT'S OVER.
WHEN THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES,
THEN IT'S OVER.
WELL, CHAVEZ KNEW
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
HE HAD SEEN THE SOLDIERS
MURDER HIS ENTIRE FAMILY,
AND HE'D BEEN HUNTED DOWN
LIKE A DOG
AND THROWN IN THE PIT.
HE KNEW HIS ONLY CHANCE
WAS TO SKIN OUT
AND HEAD SOUTH.
YAH! YAH!
BUT DOC,
HE DID HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO GO BACK TO,
AND ALTHOUGH HIM AND ME
WERE LIKE BROTHERS
AND HE REALLY WANTED TO
RIDE WITH ME,
HE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.
OH, NO.
OK, READY?
GRAB A HOLD.
LIFT HIM UP.
WHERE'S THE HAMMER?
LUKE,
GIVE US A HAND.
THAT'S IT.
GOT IT?
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
PUT THIS?
WE WANT HIS HEAD.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
SHERIFF KIMBEL?
I WANT YOU
TO GET ON YOUR HORSE,
AND I WANT YOU TO TRACK
THIS LITTLE FIEND
TO THE EDGE
OF THE EARTH.
I WANT YOU TO
ASSASSINATE HIM.
I WANT YOU TO DELIVER
HIS HEAD IN BURLAP!
I'D RATHER DRINK TURPENTINE
AND PISS ON A BRUSH FIRE.
I AIN'T
TOUCHIN' THIS ONE.
BILLY,
WHERE ARE THE MEN
YOU PROMISED US?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD AN ARMY.
I DO.
HERE IT COMES.
JESUS...JUST ONE?
THAT'S ALL
YOU COULD FIND?
NO ONE
WANT TO COME.
EVERYONE AFRAID.
ARE YOU
A FARMER?
YES, SIR.
MY NAME'S
HENDRY WILLIAM FRENCH.
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYBODY BEFORE,
HENDRY WILLIAM
FRENCH?
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYTHING BEFORE?
SAGE HEN.
SAGE HEN!
AHH...
WELL, TELL ME
SOMETHING, HENDRY.
WHY IS IT YOU WANNA
JOIN MY GANG, HUH?
WELL, I AIN'T--
I AIN'T A FARMER
NO MORE.
UH...LOST MY WIFE
TO THE POX,
LOST MY LAND
TO THE MONEY MEN.
HEY, BIG CASINO...
WHY DON'T YOU SAW A FOOT
OFF OF THIS THING
IN CASE WE RUN INTO
GOVERNOR WALLACE ON THE WAY.
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS ONE, KID.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GOTTA COME WITH US, PAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
STAY HERE
AND SCRUB POTS FOR BEEVER?
I MAY HAVE OLD BEEVER
SCRUB THE POTS FOR ME.
I'M BUYING THIS PLACE,
TURNING IT
INTO AN EATING HOUSE.
THERE'S WILDCAT MONEY
COMING IN HERE.
I GOT TO STAKE MY PIECE
WHILE I STILL GOT
A FAIR ENOUGH NAME.
WHAT NAME?
YOU'D BE RIDING
WITH KNOWN MEN, PATSY.
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A KNOWN MAN IN NEW MEXICO.
HELL,
I'LL BE A KNOWN MAN.
NEXT TIME
YOU RIDE THROUGH HERE,
THERE'LL BE
A BIG OLD SIGN OUT THERE
SAYS "GARRETT'S PLACE."
IT'S TIME
I GOT AN INCOME
THAT AIN'T
FROM STEALING HORSES.
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
SOMETHING, PAT.
I NEVER STOLE A HORSE
FROM SOMEONE I DIDN'T LIKE.
IF I DIDN'T LIKE THEM,
I JUST WOULDN'T
EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM.
NO. HE'D JUST KILL THEM.
HEY, COME ON, PAT!
YOU'RE ONE OF US!
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN ONE OF US!
I ALWAYS WILL BE, BILLY.
WELL, GO ON, THEN!
GO ON!
WE DON'T NEED YOU, PAT!
WE DON'T NEED HIM.
AH!
SOAPWEED, I GOT YOU!
YOU WANT TO EAT
OUT OF MY ASHCANS?
GO ON. HAVE A CHEW!
GO ON! GO ON!
HOWDY, BEEVER.
GO ON.
SIT WITH THE BOYS.
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?
THIS?
THIS IS THE PRINCE
OF PENNSYLVANIA.
MMM, MMM, MMM.
THE FIRST STOP
ALONG THE BLACKBIRD
WAS TO RAISE SOMEDINEROS,
AND JOHN SIMPSUM CHISUM
WAS THE RICHEST MAN
IN THE TERRITORY.
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT AS ANYONE FAMILIAR
WITH THE LINCOLN WAR KNOWS,
HE WAS A FINANCIAL PARTNER
OF TUNSTALL AND McSWEEN,
WHICH MADE HIM AN ALLY.
OLD JOHN
ADMIRED MY PLUCK
AND LOVED ME
LIKE I WAS HIS OWN SON.
WELL, BY GOD.
YOU REALLY TURNED OUT
TO BE A SNAKE, BILLY.
WHEN THEY CATCH YOU,
THEY'RE GONNA DRY GULCH
YOUR STINKING BONES.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
MY FRIENDS TO OLD MEXICO.
WE NEED SOME PESOS.
NOW, I'VE DONE
SOME FIGURING,
AND I FIGURE YOU OWE US,
MR. CHISUM--
$25O FOR THE FIGHTING
WE DID LAST YEAR
AND $25O FOR ME
LEAVING YOUR STOCK ALONE.
IS THAT
WHAT YOU FIGURED?
YES, SIR.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
THOSE FIGURES
AND SHOVE THEM UP
YOUR ARROGANT LITTLE ASS
AND SET FIRE TO THEM.
I DON'T OWE YOU
A GOD DAMN THING.
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!
I'LL BRING MY .5O DOWN
AND GIVE YOU A REAL GAME.
YEAH. WE, UH, WE SAW
SOME OF YOUR MEN
UP THERE
ON THE HIGH RANGE.
PASSED RIGHT BY THEM.
FINE BUNCH.
MR. CHISUM...
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE LINCOLN COUNTY WAR
IS OVER.
WE JUST WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE,
GET DOWN BELOW.
OH, YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW
ALL RIGHT, DOC.
YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW.
YOU'RE BILLY THE KID,
TOO, YOU KNOW.
YOU ALL ARE
DIRTY LITTLE BILLY BASTARDS,
AND I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING, DOC.
OR YOU, CHAVEZ...
YOU TOOK MY FARM,
MR. CHISUM.
YOU TOOK A LOT OF FARMS,
MR. CHISUM.
AS LONG AS BILLY THE KID
IS TAKING SOME BACK,
I'M WITH HIM.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHISUM?
YES, YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
UH...GO ON AND BRING
THE MEN IN,
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FRESH COFFEE
WITH THE BOYS HERE.
YOO-HOO!
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS.
MR. CHISUM, WHICH ONE
OF THESE BOYS
IS THE FASTEST
WITH THE IRON?
DON'T YOU DO IT,
BILLY.
THAT BE ME.
YOU.
DROP SAM COLT.
BILLY...
PUT HER DOWN NOW.
STEP AWAY.
YOU OWE ME $5OO,
MR. CHISUM,
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS KILL ONE OF YOUR MEN
FOR EVERY $5.OO YOU OWE ME.
ONLY I'M GOING TO
DO IT FAIR.
HOW'S THAT FOR SQUARE?
NOW, WHEN I GO FOR MY GUN,
YOU START SHOOTING.
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.
READY?
YEAH, I'M READY.
DAVE.
OH, MY GOD!
HENDRY.
OH, MY GOD!
HENDRY.
YOU JUST KILLED YOURSELF.
BONNEY, YOU ARE A FOOL!
YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SCOURGE OF NEW MEXICO?
WELL, BY GOD,
IAMNEW MEXICO,
AND YOU ARE DEAD.
HA HA!
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MR. NEW MEXICO.
I WOULDN'T GIVE
A BUCKET OF PISS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.
SKIN OUT, BOYS.
YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD DAY NOW.
I WANT HIM DEAD.
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S PROTECTED
BY THE SURROUNDING
COMMUNITIES.
THEY'VE
MADE A BLOODY HERO
OUT OF A HALF-WIT
COMMON HORSE THIEF.
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!
LET'S HIRE A THIEF
TO CATCH ONE.
NOW BRING HIM IN,
GOVERNOR,
AND MAKE THE OFFER.
PENDLETON.
IF I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE
TO BE, UH...
IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A FAMILY MAN,
FIXING TO SETTLE
AND RUN A BUSINESS.
MR. CHISUM HAS INFORMED US
OF YOUR AMBITIONS,
MR. GARRETT.
NOW, WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WITH BILLY BONNEY
SEVERAL TIMES
WHEN HE CUT MY HERD.
NOW, PAT,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS HIS HAUNTS,
HIS, UH, HIDEOUTS,
SOMEBODY WHO'S FAMILIAR
WITH HIS PATTERNS.
YOUAREFAMILIAR WITH HIM,
MR. GARRETT.
YOU SEE, PATRICK...
CERTAIN CHANGES
NEED TO BE STRUCTURED.
WE NEED A SHERIFF
WHO CAN ELIMINATE
THIS PARTICULAR...
PROBLEM.
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WE'RE SAYING
SHERIFF OF LINCOLN COUNTY.
SHERIFF PAT GARRETT.
NOW THAT OUGHT TO
MAKE YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
AND WE'RE SAYING $5OO...
UP FRONT.
AND 5OO AFTER.
$1,OOO, MR. GARRETT.
AND ALL THE RESOURCES
YOU NEED
TO CARRY OUT
THE EXTERMINATION
OF ONE
WILLIAM H. BONNEY.
IS THAT SATISFACTORY?
WHILE PAT WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE SANTA FE RING'S
GENEROUS OFFER,
ME AND THE BOYS WERE BUSY
SORTING OUT OUR FINANCES.
WE FIGURED THAT IF IT WAS
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP
FOR CHISUM
TO GIVE US ANY MONEY...
HOWDY.
WELL,
THEN WE'D HELP HIM OUT
AND JUST TAKE
A FEW OF HIS COWS.
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
YOU'RE CALLED KID,
AND RUDABAUGH'S
CALLED ARKANSAS DAVE,
AND, UH, I DARESAY
DOC'S CHRISTIAN NAME
AIN'T DOC.
YOU WANT A NAME.
YES, SIR.
I WOULD LIKE THAT.
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH INDEED.
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,
HENDRY.
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH PLAIN OLD HENDRY.
SORRY.
STILL TRYING TO GET
THIS RAG SHEET
OFF THE GROUND, ASH?
THE COPY IS GOOD.
THE MACHINE IS BAD.
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OPENING UP AN EATING HOUSE,
GARRETT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SECURE
AN ADVERTISEMENT?
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
JEEZUM CROW.
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THE SANTA FE RING HIRED--
NEVER MIND THAT.
I WANT TO HIRE YOU
FOR A JOB.
YOU DO?
I WANT YOU TO DOCUMENT
THE HUNT
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
IN NEW MEXICO.
I WANT
A BOOK WRITTEN ON IT
SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.
I WANT YOU
TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME
AND RECORD THE DANGERS
OF THE EXPEDITION.
RIDEALONG WITH YOU?
ON A HORSE?
OH, NO.
THIS I CAN'T DO.
I CAME OUT WEST
TO SAVE MY LAST LUNG.
I'M A JOURNALIST.
YOU'RE
A BROKE JOURNALIST,
AND YOU'RE A DRUNK.
THE COUNTRY WAS OVERGROWN
WITH WEED AND BRUSH
AND ENCUMBERED
WITH LOOSE ROCK,
MAKING IT
ALMOST IMPASSABLE.
I LIKE THAT.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
MORNING, SHERIFF.
WE MET AT THE GOVERNOR'S.
JOHN W. POE,
CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION.
THE GOVERNOR SENT ME
AND THESE MEN
TO LEND YOU A HAND.
ENCUMBERED BY IDIOTS,
WE PRESSED ON.
I LIKE THAT.
IT'S VERY GOOD.
WHAT DID THEY DO NOW--
SPELL YOUR NAME WRONG?
THEY GOT A NEW SHERIFF
ON US, BOYS.
GOES BY THE NAME
OF PAT GARRETT.
JESUS CHRIST!
WHAT THE HELL
DID HE DO THAT FOR?
MAKE HISSELF FAMOUS.
BE A KNOWN MAN LIKE ME.
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT ME, HUH?
NOTHING, DAVE.
JUST PLAYING THE GAME,
DOC.
WE'LL GIVE HIM A GAME,
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, DAVE'S BOYS.
WE RIDE NOW.
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
PAT GARRETT
THE RIDE OF HIS MISERABLE
TWO-FACED STINKING LIFE.
LET'S SKIN OUT! COME ON!
WELL, COME ON!
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
OK, TOM.
LAST ONE OUT OF HERE
DRINKS DIRTY DISHWATER.
COME ON!
SON OF A BITCH!
HO.
BURIAL GROUND.
WARM SPRINGS PEOPLE.
APACHE.
WE BETTER GET GOING.
WE'LL GO AROUND.
WHAT IS IT--
CHAVEZ, WHY DON'T YOU
GO PECK SHIT
WITH THE CHICKENS, HUH?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE PAYING
FOR APACHE BONE
IN SILVER CITY RIGHT NOW?
CHRIST ALMIGHTY,
THEY'RE MAKING...
THEY'RE MAKING ASHTRAYS,
THEY'RE MAKING COMBS,
THEY'RE MAKING
KNIFE HANDLES.
YOU GET 5O CENTS
FOR A GOOD INDIAN LEG BONE.
IT'S ALL OUT THERE,
SO DON'T YOU GO GETTING
SENTIMENTAL AND ALL THAT,
COME ON.
YOU GO IN THERE,
SMART GRINGO,
AND I'LL BURY YOU
THERE.
OK.
LET'S GO.
COME ON. YAH!
COME ON.
WHOA.
WHOO!
SILVER CITY,
HERE I COME!
AAAH!
NO!
YAH!
UGH!
