Since the time immemorial,
the knights who called themselves
the "Warriors of Light"
have been chasing witches
and sorcerers
who torture humans.
But one day,
their path was barred
by the Warriors of Darkness.
And no one wanted to make way.
And the battle started,
bloody and merciless.
As the battle reached heaven,
Great Gesser saw they were
equal,
and if the battle is not stopped,
everyone perishes.
So he stopped the battle.
So the Forces of Light
and the Forces of Darkness
signed the Armistice.
And it was said that from that
time on neither good nor evil
can be made without
mutual consent.
And it was said there
shall be the Day Watch
to watch over
the Forces of Light.
And it was said there
shall be the Night Watch
to watch over the Forces
of Darkness.
Yet in a thousand years,
the Great Other will come
and take the side of Evil,
and the world will be plunged
into the Darkness.
Hi, I've come to answer the ad.
- Have you brought the photo?
- Yes.
Hold a sec.
Give it to me.
Come in.
Moscow, 1992
The room's not done,
step in the kitchen.
You sit down, sonny.
Don't worry.
Don't pay any mind that I call you
sons. You're all sons to me.
- The story is...
- I know your story, Anton.
Anton and Irina, 6.6.90
You loved her and took
care of her,
and 2 days ago she packed
everything up
and abandoned you for
another man.
See, I know everything.
I have it from my granny
and my mom.
This is a family trait.
- We'll do everything now.
- I don't get it.
What's to get here?
She'll have a child.
Not yours.
Don't be afraid, I'll get her
back in no time.
But the child will drag her to
the rival father.
To poison the innocent fetus
is a great sin.
So, to get the wife back
one should poison the child?
Don't be scared. I'll clap
my hands and it'll die.
And the wife will throw it
away, dead.
- You'll take that sin upon you.
- Well, I don't...
Will you take it?
- The sin?
- Yes.
- I will.
- It's a deal then.
Yes.
It won't hurt. We'll do...
...everything to you.
Don't worry.
People have to be helped.
Don't be afraid, everything's
sterile with me.
- Drink it.
- Are you kidding?
- It's a...
- Are the elements important?
Or the effect?
- The effect.
- Then drink it.
Is anything wrong?
We have to part.
Good boy.
So, we'll start the part 2.
We'll deal with the cub.
Red water, alien woe,
rotten seed
and evil weed.
Gone thing that used to be.
Come hither, anguish.
There's no running away
from these words...
Don't jerk, you witch!
Get her hands.
Don't let her
clap her hands!
Help!
Go away.

Anton.
Why are you so early?
I'll be right back.
Hi there, neighbor.
Hi, dad.
I told you not to bring anyone.
It's still warm.
Is it pig's?
Human stomach is exactly
like pig's.
You know, they even make
transplants out of pigs.
"They" who?
The people.
We like you very much.
- Who?
- Our family. Me and Kostya.
Why did you bring him?
He became like us.
No, Kostya, he's the Light One.
The Light Ones drink blood
only under one circumstance.
When they hunt our likes.
Ilyukha!
- What?
- He still doesn't call.
- Dial him again.
- He won't answer.
- Why doesn't he?
- I'll call again.
Where is this villain
hiding himself?
He's underground, prob'ly.
Come to me.
Where are you?
Do you feel that rotten, bro?
I'll chew your ear off.
Come hither.
Why do you push me?
With your specs on.
You should go to work,
bloodsuckers!

Freeze! Get him.
You drink piss for sure.
Go home.
I've got you, Anton.
Sviblovo, Studyonaya St.
What's the number, Anton?
- What's wrong?
- I lost him.
Look at the number.
Don't switch the phone off.
C'mon, let's go.
Got to lose some weight.
Let's go.
Go on, drink him.
I can't.
Wait, come here.
Take a bite.
Boy, where are you?
The Night Watch.
All step out of the gloom.
Semyon, the red! Stop!
Boy, you run.
Using the living bait,
you dirty fuzz?
No, we just use some bread.
Andrey!
Shut yer kisser up.
Have you seen the number?
Gotcha. Ilyukha, ask him

Andrey, don't. Let him go.
Andrey, no!
Zawulon, Semyon!
Andrey, I'm begging you,

Wait!

Come out!
Emergency service.
City Light Company
I told you, 12, but you
said, 11.
Lena, take him. The day watch
has come.
You are charged with unlawful
use of firearms.
What does he say?
I didn't hear
because of the machine.
We've an emergency
here, sorry.
You could move your car,
or we could damage it.
Good bye.
The CLC here.
We're late, Boris Ivanovich.
He killed one.
The vampiress escaped...
What's wrong with him?
No end of numbers 12
at that street.
- 12, bldg 1, bldg 2...
- What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
Take him right here.
City Light Company
To my table!
Quick!
All of you, out! Quick!
Every Night Watchman
should be able
to fight.
The cook, the whore,
the sawbones.
The programmer.
You'd been sitting in the
office for 3.5 years
and learned to treat
the Night watch duty
as a normal human job.
Don't blame yourself.
You didn't kill him,
you just gave him
the eternal rest.
Don't sleep, talk.
It's Zawulon.
There's a woman.
- Is she young? Pretty?
- It's not the...
What?
The funnel.
The funnel.
I wanted to strike
the funnel down.
I...
Don't.
Look here, Anton.
Let's go there.
Go there. Here.
What are you pushing?
All right.
Come back, Anton,
come back.
Come back.
- Did you see her?
- Yes.
She's beautiful.
Just a moment.
- Analytics Dept.
- Beat to quarters.
Anton found the funnel
of damnation.
I should know for sure
what's gonna happen in Moscow
in the next 24 hours.

INCIDENTS
The flight Moscow-Antalia
crashed over Moscow.
Pilot-in-command and
the crew of IL84
the flight 99753
Moscow-Antalia...
The flight time
I left my swimsuit
in the hotel.
I took it.
- You were in the room?
- So what?
- Did you look in the mirror?
- Why?
Jesus, don't start that again.
- Let's skip the flight.
- Then skip it.
Here she is. The virgin.
There lived a virgin in Byzantum,
and someone wished her evil
and cursed her.
Wherever she trod, bad luck
lurked over her head.
She took a candle, and the
candle died down.
She petted a puppy, and
the puppy died.
A bird that ate from her hand
fell to the ground.
In the houses she visited
children died.
The darkness and ravage
ruled the city.
The ravage and darkness.
So warriors stepped
from the dark
who called themselves the
Warriors of Darkness.
And from among the people
those stepped out
who called themselves
the Warriors of Light.
And the great Battle
between Dark and Light began.
But no one could win,
for they were equal.
It will be so until
a man emerges
who is fated to become
the Great one.
If he takes the side of Light,
the Light wins.
But those who know the truth
say he'd choose the Darkness.
For it's easier to kill
the Light in oneself
than to scatter
the Darkness.
The prophecy comes true.
Pass me on to Alice.
It's Zawulon.
I can't talk at the moment.
- You know what happened?
- No.
Your hairdresser. They bashed
his head against the basin.
Bring me the one
who did this.
I'm coming.
We'll train his girlfriend.
The one with the scorched face.
CLC issued the license on her
to the hairdresser,
I mean, allowed
to gobble her up.
It turned out they knew
each other.
She offered him her throat.
I warned her, I did.
You can't tell enough, they're
young and unafraid.
They caught them on live bait.
Now she's starved.
- Give me.
- Are you salivating?
Give me.
- Andrey taught you to call.
- Well, he did. Give me.
The kid answered your call.
Lure him out.
And when he's in your hands,
demand
to see the one who killed
your Andrey.
My Andrey.
Give me, please.
Give it to me!
Do you want a revenge?
- Don't torture her.
- Please?
- She'll sure find him now.
- How?
She'll find him.
Like a dog.
Come to me.
Where are you going?
I have to find him.
Find whom?
The boy.
Where are you going?
You're barely alive.
We shouldn't've charged you
with field work.
To drink blood and catch
vampires is not for you.
It's not the point.
What is?
We license them ourselves.
So?
And then we use our live
bait to catch them.
Who said it? Whose words
are those?
Those are my words.
It's me who says it.
You don't know anything.
Sitting here,
you don't know anything.
It was a child.
A child.
He's like a bitten
sandwich to her now.
Torn from her mouth
in the last moment.
If I don't find him,
she'll do it.
Wait.
I'll give you a partner.
You've killed
a Dark one, Anton.
Zawulon won't forgive you for
that. You need protection.
What's this?
It's Olga.
She'll help you.
Why do I need it?
It's your choice.
From our last program
we learnt
how to use live bait.
Today let's talk about owls.
Owls are a special case
of nocturnal predators.
Only an owl can look
at an object
with both eyes at a time
due to their evolved
adaptation.
Owls mostly are
nocturnal species.
Owls can see the heat their
victim's body emanates.
Owl's eye can perceive
invisible infra-red rays.
Managed to foist it off.
The predator who has
a peculiarity...
I didn't want to kill!
Owls feed on animal life,
small animals and birds.
Check out where she lives
and works.
All her contacts
in the last 3 days.
Who could send this damned
curse? And when?
This is a matter of minutes
now, mind it.
I met a curse that strong
I see. How much time
do we have?
No time.
Is it her?
Yes, Svetlana Nazarova, aged 29,
she works in the clinic No 17.
Has never come in view of
the Night Watch.
Lives with her mother in 37,
Vatutinki, bldg A.
It's close to Vnukovo airport.
Incidents:
Mom is hospitalized, kidney
problem, a grafting is necessary.
A friend's kid is sick,
she visited them.
Here's another victim,
their neighbor Auntie
Valya, aged 78.
She's a tough woman, yet
called the ambulance.
That witch gave her
a bad look.
- How do you do.
- Hello, Sveta.
- What kind of a dog is that?
- Maxim brought from work,
and I don't know
what to do with it.
Let her live.
Let her live.
- Take care, Auntie Valya.
- Thank you, Sveta.
Olga.
Wanna eat?
A feathered wonder.
Say something.
Be human.
Turn away.
Don't look.
Don't turn
- You...
- Turn away.
Are you scared?
The shower is - there.
- Why did they do it to you?
- It's a punishment.
How do they spin it?
Up left is hot, right is cold.
No... But yes.
I've never heard of
punishments like this.
You've never heard of
crimes like this.
D'you have anything to
change into?
In a moment.
Do you have any woman's
clothes by any chance?
What?
I'm sorry, it's just in case.
Here, I have it from my mom.
Thanks.
Anything wrong?
No.
Step inside.
You know, Anton,
there are too few
of us left.
And when someone goes
away for good,
all of us feel it immediately.
That's how the world
spins, neighbor.
There's an agreement.
- You understand what I say.
- What, Anton?
Yours and ours have struck
a deal that
everything may be done
but in turns.
I still don't get one thing.
