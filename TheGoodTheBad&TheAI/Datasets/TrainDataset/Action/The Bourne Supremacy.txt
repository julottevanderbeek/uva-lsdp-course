Alexanderplatz Station,
This is Survey Three.
There's a lot of protesters here.
There's no way we can cover out there.
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!
- She's not here. She's gone.
- Goddamn it!
- They are not on the tram.
- He's one guy!
Jason, please don't hurt me.
What were my words?
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.
I did. I swear.
Jason, I told them
that I believed you.
I'm gonna ask you
some some simple questions.
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!
Who's Pamela Landy?
-
She's a task force chief.
- Is she running Treadstone?
No, she's
the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?
Last week
an agency field officer tried to
make a buy off of one ofher ops.
He was trying to sell out
a mole or something
and you got to him before we did.
- I killed him?
- You left a print.
There were partial prints
that trace back to Treadstone.
They know it was you.
- That is insane.
- Why are you doing this?
Why come back now?
Landy will find...
Stop. Stop.
Last week
I was 4,000 miles away in India,
watching Marie die.
They came for me,
and they killed her instead.
This ends now.
-
- Find her.
-
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?
- Please! I'm only here because of Paris.
Abbott dragged us...
- Abbott? Who's Abbott?
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.
Is he here in Berlin?
Yes.
Did he run Treadstone?
Did he run Treadstone?
Yes.
Conklin reported to him.
Please. Please, I swear...
What was Landy buying?
What kind of files?
Conklin... Stuff on Conklin.
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.
Neski.
Wh-What?
What are you talking about?
Training is over... Training is over...
Training is over...
When... When was I here in Berlin?
What are you talking about?
For Treadstone.
I did a job here.
When?
No, you never worked
in Berlin before.
My first job. In Berlin.
You know my file.
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!
No, your first assignment
was Geneva.
You fucking people!
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, Nicky!
-
It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!
No, I swear... Oh, please.!
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.
We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.
Over here, Luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.
How many men are out there?
Two coming down the back stairs.
The rest, they're fanned out for a search.
- What's our security situation here?
-  Where, "here"? The ground?
Here here. In the building.
Check everything, and recheck
all the stairwells, hallways, everything.
It's done.
Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.
- And check out his story
about the girlfriend in India too.
- I'm on it.
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.
- He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire.
- Don't you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn't sound like a man in control to me.
We know he was in Berlin.
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now...
What now? Terminate him?
You've been pushing that agenda
ever since we got here.
- He also said you were running Treadstone.
Should we believe that too?
- I'm convinced Bourne knows something.
He knows that you're after him,
and in the interest of self-preservation
you might start with that.
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?
I need to show you
something.
All right, I finished my box work,
but I wanted to show you
before I showed Landy.
Came down here last night...
because none of this
is making any sense.
I'm with you... Conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.
You know that.
There were two charges that were
supposed to go off simultaneously.
The second one, over here, didn't go off.
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.
And second, why put the charge
all the way down here?
If you're good enough to get in here
and handle the gear, you're good enough
to know you don't need this.
Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.
But what if somebody
were trying to cover their tracks
by blaming Conklin and Bourne?
What if Bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?
- Show me again.
- All right.
Well, you put...
Pull over. He's getting out.
This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?
This is a live project,
and you're a go.
- I'll see you on the other side.
-
"
- Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
- I want to get a room for the night.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.
I'm sorry, sir.
That room is occupied.
How about room 644?
It's right across the hall.
Sir?
That's fine. Thank you.
I just need your passport
and signature right here, please.
Have a nice night.
Ja.
Berlin Polizei.
Where?
Brecker Hotel.
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!
- Brecker? How far?
- About five or six minutes.
Hi.!
Hey!
Congratulations, soldier.
Training is over.
-
- Polizei.! Polizei.!
Go!
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark T-shirt, dark pants.
The cops out there
wanna corral all the guests together
and check 'em out one by one.
That will really work.
What the hell's he doing here?
Maybe he just
wanted to stay the night.
-
-
Polizei.!
Polizei! Polizei!
Polizei.! Polizei.!
Polizei! Polizei!
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.
But they found Nicky.
She's back at the Westin.
Bourne let her go.
He let her go?
Yeah.
Where's Danny Zorn?
He ought to head over there
and debrief her.
Why did Bourne come here?
We don't know yet.
Landy's upstairs
in one of the rooms.
She said she'd call you
when she's done.
Okay.
I think I'll, uh... take a cab
back to the hotel.
So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.
Mmm.
Why would he come in here?
What are you thinking?
I recognize this room
from a photo.
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.
This is where
his wife killed him?
Do you still think
his wife killed him?
Guess he got out
through this window.
We just got word
from the Berlin police.
They found Danny Zorn's body.
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.
Call Abbott.
Tell him to wait for me
in his hotel.
I'm coming to see him.
- Da.
- It's me.
They're onto Neski.
This is not a clean phone.
They can't prove anything
without Bourne.
Kill Bourne,
and you kill this investigation.
I'm afraid, Ward,
the time has come for us
to part company.
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen C.I.A. seed money.
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.
We both got rich.
I don't owe you anything.
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?
He's still out there.
Now get him.
GetJason...
I don't suppose
it would do me much good
to cry for help, huh?
Not much.
You killed her.
It was a mistake.
It was supposed to be you.
There were files linking me
to the Neski murder.
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,
they'd be chasing a ghost
for 10 years.
So we got in the way.
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?
You killed Marie...
the minute
you climbed into her car.
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.
I told you people
to leave us alone.
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.
There's no place
it won't catch up to you.
It's how every story ends.
It's what you are, Jason...
a killer.
You always will be.
Go ahead. Go on. Go on.!
Do it.! Do it.!
She wouldn't want me to.
That's the only reason
you're alive.
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.
And Danny Zorn?
What was he?
Unlucky.
Collateral damage.
So, what do we do now?
I'm not sorry.
No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.
No, that's nothing.
- Good synch-up.
- Who's this guy?
Platform "B."
Go ahead. Go on. Go on.!
Do it.! Do it.!
She wouldn't want me to.
That's the only reason
you're alive.
Got a call from Langley.
They're, uh, going through
Abbott's records,
and Marshall wants to know
what's going on with Bourne.
Wait, Teddy.
Teddy, who's this?
Look at this guy.
He's about to enter...
Right there.! There.!
Right through there.
That's Bourne.
- Get down here! We got something!
- We got a sighting.! Check it out.!
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.
Here it comes again.
-  Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
He's just entered frame.
- It's the coat. That's him!
What train is that?
- That's the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?
Get me
the Russian interior ministry.
"
"
Da.
"
Da.

-
-
I speak English.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I won't hurt you.
You're older.
Older than I thought you'd be.
That picture.
Does that mean a lot to you?
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.
No.
It's 'cause you don't know
how they died.
I do.
No, you don't.
I would want to know.
I would want to know that my...
that my mother didn't kill my father,
that she didn't kill herself.
What?
It's not what happened
to your parents.
I killed them.
I killed them.
It was my job.
It was my first time.
Your father
was supposed to be alone.
But then your mother...
came out of nowhere,
and I had to change my plan.
It changes things,
that knowledge.
Doesn't it?
When what you love
gets taken from you,
you wanna know the truth.
I'm sorry.
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.
Bourne?
What do you want?
I wanted to thank you...
for the tape.
We got what we needed.
It's all tied off. It's over.
I guess I owe you an apology.
Is that official?
No. Off the record.
You know how it is.
Good-bye.
Wait. Wait.
David Webb.
That's your real name.
You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.
Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.
Bourne?
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
