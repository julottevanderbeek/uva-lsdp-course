I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
'The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full.'
'Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.'
Enough talk. Let's fight!
Shashabooey!
'He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind
- 'from over-exposure to pure awesomeness.'
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?
- There is no charge for awesomeness.
Or attractiveness. HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING
Kablooey! 'It mattered not how many foes he faced.'
'They were no match for his bodacity!'
'Never before had a panda been so feared!'
'And so loved.'
'Even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five...
'bowed in respect to this great Master.'
- We should hang out.
- Agreed.
ALL: Hya!
'But hanging out would have to wait cos when you're facing the 10,000

- About what? What were you dreaming about?
What was I...? Um, I was dreaming about, uh...
uh...noodles.
Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
Oh, careful! That soup is sharp.
Oh, happy day! My son finally having the noodle dream!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You don't know how long I've been waiting
for this moment. This is a sign, Po.
- Uh, a sign of what?
- You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
Then you will fulfil your destiny and take over the restaurant,
as I took it over from my father who took it over from his father,
who won it from a friend in mah-jong.
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream. HE CHUCKLES
No, it was THE dream.
We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
But Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
- Something besides noodles?
- Actually, when I was young and crazy,
I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
- So, why didn't you?
- Because it was a stupid dream.
Can you imagine me making tofu?
- HE LAUGHS
- Tofu.
No! We all have our place in this world.
- Mine is here and yours is...
- I know, is here.
No, it's at tables two, five, seven and 12.

It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
HE EXHALES AND INHALES

Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?

Nothing is impossible.
Zeng! Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards,
their weapons, everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

One often meets his destiny

We can't let him march on the valley and take his revenge! He'll -
Your mind is like this water, my friend.
When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see,
but if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.
- The Dragon Scroll.
- It is time.
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
To become the Dragon Warrior?
I don't know.
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

- This is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
- Po!
- Where are you going?
- To the Jade Palace.
But you're forgetting your noodle cart.
The whole valley will be there and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
Selling noodles?
- But Dad, I was thinking maybe I...
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...
- Uh-huh?
..could also sell the bean buns. They're... They're about to go bad.
That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign.
Yeah. Glad I had it.

- Hello?
- Have you finished sight-seeing?
- Sorry, I should have come to you first.
- My patience is wearing thin.
Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.
Hey, how's it going? Now, how do you get five... Master Shifu! Oh!
SPIRITS WAILING Someone... broke that,
but I'm gonna fix it. Do you have some... glue? SPIRITS WAILING
Ow! Ow! Ooh. A splinter.
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior, hm?
- Uh, I guess so.
- Wrong!
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be until
you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
Whoa. So, um, how does this work?
Do you have a ladder or a trampoline or...?
- CHUCKLES:
- You think it's that easy?
That I'm just gonna hand you the secret to limitless power?
- No, I -
- One must first master the highest level of kung fu
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.
- Someone like me?
- Yes! Look at you!
- This fat butt!
- Agh!
- Flabby arms!
- Ow!
- Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
- And this ridiculous belly.
- Hey!
- And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
- Wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
- Don't stand that close.
- I can smell your breath.
- Listen, Oogway said I was -
The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh-haw-haw, you know this hold?
Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty, yes.
- Oh, then you know what happens when I flex my pinkie?
- No, no!
You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part
- is cleaning up afterwards.
- OK, OK, take it easy.
Now, listen closely, panda.
Oogway may have picked you but when I'm through with you,
I promise you you're going to wish he hadn't!
- Are we clear?
- Oh, yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We're so clear.
Good. I can't wait to get started.

Wh-What... now?
Yes, now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong
- and you are not the Dragon Warrior?
- Oh, OK, well...
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
If we don't try, we'll never know, will we?
Yeah, it's just maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
- And what level is that?
- Well, I'm not a master
but, uh, let's just start at zero. Level zero.
- CHUCKLES:
- No. There is no such thing as level zero.
- Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
- That?
We use that for training children and propping the door open
when it's hot, but if you insist...
Whoa, the Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures.
Except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
Um, are they gonna watch or should I wait till they get back to work?
- Hit it.
- OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate,
um, so I'm still digesting, so my kung fu might not be as good as
- later on.
- Just hit it.
All right.
What you got? You got nothing cos I got it right here.
You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder.
What you gonna do about crazy feet?
Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
You've only seen praying Mantis or Monkey style.
- Ooh-ooh-aaa-aaa. Or I could come at you snickety-snake.
- Would you hit it!

Why don't you try again? A little harder.

What was Master Oogway thinking? The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
- on a ball of fire!
- When he walks, the very ground shakes!
- ALL LAUGH
One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
- Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
- Or even see his toes.

Some day, huh? CHUCKLES: That kung fu stuff
- is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?
- Um...
I've had a long and rather disappointing day,
so, uh... yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.
It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!
You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
Outnumbered 1,000 to one but you didn't stop.
You just...
- Ooh, sorry about that.
- Uh, look, you don't belong here.
SIGHS: I know.
I know. You're right. I don't have... I just...
- My whole life I've dreamed of...
- No, I meant you don't belong here
in this room. This is my room.
Property of Crane.
Oh, OK. Right, right. So, you want to get to sleep?
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up? We got big things tomorrow.
All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. OK, bye-bye.
HE SIGHS What was that?
- I didn't say anything.
- OK. All right. Good night.
Sleep well.
That seemed a little bit awkward. FLOORBOARDS CREAK
Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you. Just, um...
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, yeah, of course. This is your room.
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
You're a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect
for who we are and what we do,
you will be gone by morning.
Big fan!
OWLS HOOTING IN DISTANCE
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
MUFFLED: Hm. Is that what this is?
I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
I understand. You eat when you are upset.
Upset? I'm not upset. Wh-What makes you think I'm upset?
So why are you upset?
SIGHS: I probably sucked more today than anyone
in the history of kung fu, in the history of China,
- in the history of sucking!
- Probably.
And the Five! Man, you should've seen 'em!
- They totally hate me.
- Totally.
How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
I mean, I'm not like the Five.
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.
Even Mantis has those... thingies.
Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
Quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles.
You are too concerned with what was and what will be.
There's a saying. Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift.
That is why it is called "the present".

You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!
And years longer to apply it in combat.
Aw.
Hm.
Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
- Yeah! Excellent.

I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more.
- Your next opponent will be me.
- All right! Yeah, let's go!
- Step forth.
- Agh!
- The true path to victory
is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it.
- Oh, yeah!
- To take his strength and use it against him
until he finally falls...or quits.
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry, Master, I will never quit!
Agh! Ooh!
YELLS AND SCREAMS
Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ugh!

Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean, look at me.
I'm over here.
- Agh-ha!
- Maybe you should look at this again.
Oh, OK.
- Ow! Stop it. Stop! That's... Agh!
- Oh!
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all,
but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
HE CHUCKLES
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
- Agh!
- ..but he wasn't always like that.
According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu
- actually used to smile.
- No!
- Yes.
- But that was before.
- Before what?
- Before Tai Lung.
We're not really supposed to talk about him.
Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung. He was a student.
The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
And then he turned bad and now he's in jail and...
He wasn't just a student.
- 'Shifu found him as a cub.'
- HE BABBLES
- 'And he raised him as his son.'
- Ow! Oh.
'And when the boy showed talent in kung fu,
'Shifu trained him.'
'He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.'
- Ya!
- 'It was never enough for Tai Lung.'
'He wanted the Dragon Scroll,
'but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.'
'Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.'
'He tried to take the scroll by force
'and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.'
'But how could he?'
SHIFU PANTS
'Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before...'
Hi-ha-hoo! Huh!
- A-ha.
- Hm.
'..or since.'
SHE SIGHS
And now he has a chance to make things right,
to train the true Dragon Warrior,
and he's stuck with you, a big fat panda
- who treats it like a joke.
- Doing!
- Oh, that is it!
- Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
And may have also stopped his heart.

I have... It's... It's very bad news.
Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.
Master, your vision. Your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way!
That is bad news...
..if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
There are no accidents.
- SIGHS:
- Yes, I know. You've said that already.
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident either.
- Thrice.
- My old friend,
the panda will never fulfil his destiny nor you yours
until you let go of the illusion of control.
- Illusion?
- Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,
nor make it bear fruit before its time.
- But there are things we can control.
- HE GRUNTS
I can control when the fruit will fall.
- HE CHUCKLES
- And I can control...
Ya! ..where to plant the seed. Ha-ya!
That is no illusion, Master.
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
You may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach.
- But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
- Maybe it can
if you are willing to guide it,
to nurture it, to believe in it.
But how? How?
- I need your help, Master.
- No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu.
Promise me you will believe.
I... I will try.
Hm, good.
My time has come.
You must continue your journey without me.
Wh-Wh-What are you... Wh...
Master! You can't leave me!
You must believe.
Master!
- Were you scared?
- Yeah, so I'm like, "Fine, you may be a wolf,
"you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province,
- "but you're a lousy tipper."
- Really?
- So how did you get out of there alive?
- I didn't actually say that,
but I thought it in... In my mind.
If he could read my mind, he'd have been like, "What?"
Order up! Hope you like it. SLURPING
- This is really good!
- No, come on. Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.
- What are you talking about? This is amazing!
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.
- Tigress, you've got to try this.
- Hm.
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and, uh, universe juice.
HE SLURPS
SIGHS, ALL LAUGH
- What?
- Oh, nothing, Master Shifu.
- LAUGHING
"You'll never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds
"and brush your teeth!" "What is that noise? Laughter?"
"I've never heard of it! Work hard, panda, and maybe some day
- "you will have ears like mine."
- That's good.
- Oh.
Ears? It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
- It's Shifu!
- Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
Oooh, Master Shifu!
- Uh...
- You think this is funny?
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
- What?
- He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and you are the only one
who can stop him.
LAUGHS: And here I am saying you got no sense of humour. I'm gonna...
stop Tai Lung... What? You're serious? And I have to...
Uh, M-Master Oogway will stop him. He did it before, he'll do it again.
Oogway cannot! Not any more.
- ALL GASP
- Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!
- Master, please let us stop Tai Lung.
- This is what you've trained us for.
- No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung, it is his! Where'd he go?
HE SCREAMS
HE SCREAMS AND PANTS
- Oh!
- You cannot leave!
- A real warrior never quits.
- Watch me.
Come on. How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.
You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
Ow! You don't believe that. Ooh! You never believed that.
- From the moment I got here, you've tried to get rid of me.
- Yes!
- Agh!
- I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master
as I have come to trust in mine.
You're not my master and I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted to get rid of you,
- yet you stayed.
- Yeah, I stayed.
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head
or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more
than it did every day of my life just being me.
I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me,
could make me not me,
it was you, the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior and I will!
Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you
gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior? Huh?
How? How?
- How?!
- I don't know!
- SIGHS:
- I don't know.
That's what I thought.
This is what you trained me for.
Tigress!
Don't try and stop me.
We're not trying to stop you.
- What?
- We're coming with you!

Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey.
He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
PANS CLATTERING
- Don't tell Monkey.
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know I disgust you.
- No, no, I mean how did you get up there?
I don't know. I... guess... I don't know. I was getting a cookie.
And yet you are ten feet off the ground

Panda, we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
- Hm? The Pool of...
- This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries
of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of kung fu.
HE GASPS
- Do you want to learn kung fu?
- Yeah!
Then I am your master!
OK!
- Don't cry.
- OK. HE SNIFFS AND SIGHS
When you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate,
you stink. But perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
I now see that the way to get through to you is with this.
- Oh, great, cos I am hungry. LAUGHS:
- Good.
When you have been trained, you may eat.
Mmm. Let us begin.
HE GRUNTS AND GROWLS

No sit-ups? No-No-No ten-mile hike?

- Enjoy.

- Where's the Dragon Warrior?
- How do you know you're not looking at her?
- LAUGHS:
- You think I'm a fool?
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior! None of you!
I heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire,
that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.
Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
GROWLS, TAI LUNG GRUNTS

- SHIFU:
- You have done well, panda.
- Done well?
- Done well? Ha, I've done awesome!
- Ooh!
The mark of a true hero is humility,
- but yes, you have done...
- Ow!
- ..awesome.
HE LAUGHS
FLAPPING AND THUDDING
Huh?
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!
No, they're breathing. They're asleep? No, their eyes are open.
- We were no match for his nerve attack.
- He has gotten stronger.
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
- He's too fast! Sorry, Po.
- TIGRESS GASPS
- I thought we could stop him.
- He could have killed you.
- Why didn't he?
- So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts,
- but it won't work.
- Uh, it might.
I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared.
- You can defeat him, panda!
- Are you kidding? If they can't...
They're five masters. I'm just one me.
But you will have the one thing that no-one else does.
- You really believe I'm ready?
- You are...
Po.
HE BREATHES HEAVILY
Behold the Dragon Scroll.
- It is yours.
- Wait. What happens when I read it?
No-one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear
- a butterfly's wing beat.
- Whoa, really? That's cool.
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.
Wow! Can I punch through walls? C-C-Can I do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.
- Will I have invisibility?
- Focus.
- Huh?
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah.
Read it, Po, and fulfil your destiny.
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.
Whoa!
HE GRUNTS It's impossible to open.
PO GRUNTS: OK. Come on, baby.
Come on, now.
POPPING Thank you.
I probably loosened it up for you, though.
CLEARS THROAT OK, here goes.
HE SCREAMS
ALL GASP
- It's blank.
- What?!
- Here, look.
- No! I am forbidden to look upon...
Blank. I don't...
I don't understand.
OK. So, like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
But who will stop Tai Lung?
He'll destroy everything and everyone.
No. Evacuate the valley.
You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
But Shifu, he'll kill you.
Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
Listen to me, all of you.
It is time for you to continue your journey without me.
I am very proud to have been your master.
- We've got to get them out safely.
- Come, little one.
- Let's find your mama.
- Viper, gather the southern farmers,
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way.
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior
- Hey, Dad.
- Po!
Good to have you back, son.
- Good to be back.
- Let's go, Po.
CREAKING
So, for our next shop it's time to face it.
The future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices.
Also, I was thinking maybe this time
we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
Hm? You like that?
Uh, Po, I-I'm sorry if things didn't work out.
I-I-It just wasn't meant to be.
Po, forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.
We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
I don't know, Dad.
Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
Oh! Po, I think it's time
I told you something I should have told you
- a long time ago.
- OK.
The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
Oh!
Come here. The secret ingredient is...
- ..nothing!
- Huh?!
You heard me. Nothing! There is no secret ingredient!
Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
- You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
- Don't have to.
To make something special, you have to believe it's special.

There is no secret ingredient.

This battle is between you and me.
- So, that is how it's going to be.
- That is how it must be.
HE GROWLS AND SNARLS
HE SCREAMS
- HE GRUNTS
- Hya!
I rotted in jail for 20 years
- because of your weakness!
- Obeying your master is not weakness!
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
'You always knew.'
'But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?'
'What did you do?!'
- Nothing!
- You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior!
- That was not my fault!
- Not your fault?!
Who filled my head with dreams?!
Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!
Who denied me my destiny?!
Hya!

It was never my decision to make!

I... I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment, I've been... proud of you.
And it was my pride that blinded me.
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
..what I... was turning you into.
I'm s... I'm sorry.
- HE GROWLS:
- I don't want your apology,
I want my scroll!
What?! Where is it?!
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
- HE CHOKES:
- You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.
- Never.

- N... Never.

Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.
You are the Dragon Warrior.
You have brought peace...
to this valley,
and... and to me.
Thank you.
Thank you... Po.
Thank you. Thank you.
No! Master!
- No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please!

Uh, Dragon Warrior.
