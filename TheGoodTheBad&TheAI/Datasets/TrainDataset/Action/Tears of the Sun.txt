Tension that had been brewing for
months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu
orchestrated a swift and violent coup...
...against the democratically elected
government of President Samuel Azuka.
In the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups...
...there'd been a long history
of ethnic enmity...
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.
The victorious Fulani rebels
have taken to the streets...
...as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country.
Thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter.
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo
have abandoned their homes...
...and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it.
Gen. Yakubu has taken control
of most of the country...
...and appears firmly in charge.
There's no word on the United Nations'
reaction to the coup...
...but United States forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy.
As you can see behind me,
on the USS Harry S. Truman...
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.
This once peaceful country...
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.
However, nothing can prepare
the country...
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...
...has been assassinated.
l repeat:
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.
Let me take those for you.
He got one in the leg!
Put him in the sickbay now!
Well, look at you.
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.
See you in chow to debrief.
You...
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.
Attention on deck.
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.
Everybody get chow?
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.
Now, intel estimates
...scattered throughout this sector.
They've captured
government armories...
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.
ln addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
lnternational Relief Services.
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.
Your secondary objective...
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...
...if they so choose to leave.
St. Michael's Mission, right here.
You will halo over Cameroon...
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.
When you get your package...
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.
-Questions?
-Sir...
...rules of engagement?
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.
Anything else, gentlemen?
All right.
Dismissed.
Gentlemen, three minutes out.
lt's okay. lt's okay.
You speak English?
You speak English?
Good. Good.
l'm not gonna hurt you.
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?
You sure? You sure?
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.
Nice and easy. Come on.
Zee, we're moving.
lt's all right. l'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?
Open.
Clear.
Lasana, where's that wa--?
These American men are here
to see you!
l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
l'm here to get you and your people out.
We're in the middle of surgery here.
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.
You're frightening my staff.
l'll be with you when l'm done.
Now please wait outside!
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?
Doc, maybe you can help her out.
Ma'am, may l assist?
-Are you a doctor?
-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.
Then close for me.
We're taking our good old time here.
All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.
Hurry up, Doc.
l assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.
Get your things together,
but pack light.
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.
l'm responsible for 70 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.
What does that mean?
l mean nonindigenous personnel,
ma'am.
Then we have a problem.
l will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...
...including privileged white doctors.
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.
We can take those who can walk.
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.
You're right, lieutenant...
...it's not your problem.
lt is my responsibility...
...and l will not leave
without my people.
All right, give me a minute.
-A minute?
-That's right.
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.
Get Command on the horn.
Eagle One to Command.
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.
Eagle One to Command.
Eagle One.
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.
No, we got her.
But she wants to bring the 70 people
here along with her.
Yes, sir, l understand.
l will handle it.
Eagle One, out.
Dr. Kendricks.
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.
There will be helicopters for them too?
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.
l understand.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Hurry, please.
Why don't we just get Doc
to trang her the fuck out?
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.
l ain't sure this bitch is American.
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.
We must leave guickly.
Quickly!
God will bless you, Lena.
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?
Okay, let's clear these hooches.
Come here, you guys.
lt's okay. lt's okay. Come on.
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.
Bless you, Lena.
Thank you for everything.
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.
Take care of yourself.
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.
All right. Let's go.
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.
Roger that.
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.
Come on.
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!
Sister Grace.
-The mother?
-She is dead.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What am l going to do
with this child?
Lena.
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
lt's the only chance she has.
We gotta move guicker than this.
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.
Take care of yourself, girl.
Sister Siobhan.
Mind yourself.
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.
l'm not going.
Sister!
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-l'm not going.
What?
Good luck.
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.
All right, let's make it guick.
Come on, ma'am, let's go.
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.
Take care.
Go with God.
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.
l got her.
We're only five klicks in. lt's seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.
Let's go.
Come on. You've gotta speed up.
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--
Watch those trees.
l'm gonna help you.
lt's all right. l'll tell them.
We got you.
Lieutenant.
We need to stop.
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.
These people need to rest.
And we have a child
who needs medication.
Here we go.
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.
Let's go, doctor.
Come on, sir. Here we go.
What you want to do?
Rest for 30.
Lake, hold it up.
We're gonna rest for 30.
Set a perimeter.
Perimeter up.
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...
...on our path.
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to-- Listen to me!
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby guiet, you understand me?
Whatever it takes. Go now.
Get up. Get up.
Danger close.
Go.
Clear.
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.
And find us a safe place to rest.
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.
l can't do that. lt'd risk the safety
of all these people here.
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.
l don't presume
to know them all. Red?
Dr. Kendricks.
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.
Come on.
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?
lt's my watch, ma'am.
You can call me Lena.
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest
you get some rest.
You know....
Thank you for saving my life.
lt wasn't about saving your life.
lt's about getting the job done.
Completing the mission, that's all.
My dear...
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.
-But l'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.
Gentlemen.
Please.
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.
There are only sick people here.
Please, sir.
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!
No! Please! Please!
-No!
-No!
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.
We have only sick people here.
Please.
No, commander.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God...
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.
Commander, no!
-Blessed....
-No!
Holy Mary, mother of God....
What the fuck was that?
Hyena.
Flea, Lake, status?
Clear.
Clear, L.T.
Zee?
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.
This is Star One. My E TA,
your location, five minutes.
Popping smoke.
Do you have smoke?
Roger. Yellow smoke.
That's us.
Eyes on.
Slo, bring her up.
-Let's go! Come on! Now!
-Let's go, ma'am. Come on.
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.
Come on!
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!
lt's a gunship!
lt's here to protect us!
-What about the others?
-They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!
You gotta move faster!
-What are you doing?!
-Keep your head down!
Stand back.
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!
Keep your head down!
-Let us go!
-Dr. Lena!
-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?
l simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!
-What about my people?!
-l'm not here for them.
You lied to me!
You lied to me!
Liar! Bastard!
Lena! Let me go!
What about my people?!
l won't leave them!
You lied to me!
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!
Who decides for me?! You?!
Your government?!
Bastard! l won't leave them!
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Let's go!
Lena! Lena!
Listen to me!
Listen to me! lt's okay.
Let's go!
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.
We saw this on the way in.
No!
No!
No!
-Doc!
-No!
Come on.
Let's turn it around.
Musa.
Patience!
Lena!
We can only take 1 2 people.
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.
Go. And tell the others.
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.
Thank you.
Hurry, please.
Red!
Go with the package.
Now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?
New mission?
No.
Same mission.
Get them ready, Zee.
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.
Let's go! Get her ready.
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!
Get her out of there!
Get off!
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!
Keep your head down.
She has no one to care for her.
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!
Hold her tight!
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.
See you in Cameroon.
Come on. Let's go.
Here we go. Stay low.
Head down.
Let's go.
Sergeant! Let's go!
Eagle One, over.
Can you wait one, sir?
A.K.
Command.
Yes, sir?
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.
You can't get a woman on a helo?
She was on the bird.
-It's difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Reguest helicopters to take them out.
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.
Come on, give me three choppers. l'll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.
Negative!
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.
We'll give you what help we can
from our end, but right now...
...you are on your own.
Man, l hope you know
what you're doing.
Me too, sir.
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.
Negative on the evac.
Come on. There you go. Come on.
Hang on to the knot, doctor.
-Come on.
-We got you.
Come on. Come on, doc.
Americans.
Some went in the helicopter.
Some went up the mountain...
...to Cameroon.
Slo.
Give me your chow, man.
l don't like roast beef anyway.
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.
Roger that.
What do you got?
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.
How strong?
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.
Rebels?
Could be.
Why would anybody be following us?
l don't know.
But we're gonna find out.
Good job.
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.
-Sir?
-We got a problem.
We got possible hostiles on our 6.
Get them up, get them ready to move.
Roger that.
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?
Thank you. lt'll just take a second.
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.
You sure?
Yes, l'm sure.
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.
Get your people ready to go now.
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.
Come on.
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.
How you doing?
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?
You know what l'm talking about.
You know as well as l do...
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...
...and we hump for a day.
Zee, keep them moving.
Be with you in a second.
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.
l'm confused.
And the boys are confused.
Get to the point.
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?
Talk to me.
l'm with you either way.
You know that.
When l figure it out, l'll let you know.
This way.
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.
You're gonna want to come
take a look at this.
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!
Slo.
Stay down. Stay down.
Zee, Flea, with me.
What do you got?
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.
How strong?
l counted seven so far, sir.
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.
There could be more in the hooches.
Bring them up.
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.
L.T.
Rules of engagement.
We're already engaged.
Hand me the binoculars.
Flea, you got the Zippo?
Roger that.
Zippo first.
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.
Silent and guick.
Gold Team, on me.
Silk, close up that back door.
-Flea, keep your eye on the package.
-Roger that.
Holding.
Let's go.
On-site.
Goddamn.
Been going at it all day.
-On-site.
-Roger that.
Go!
lt's okay. l'm here to help you.
l'll help you. lt's okay.
Atkins!
Hide!
Go! Run! Get out of here!
-Doc, get them out of here!
-Move!
Go! Go!
Hold on. You hold on.
Come on, little man, come on.
Boss, you want me to take a look
at that?
l'm all right.
lt's a kid. lt's only a fucking kid.
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.
Look at your work, motherfucker.
Lake.
Doc, get over here.
Red.
Her baby's dead.
Zee.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.
She has a low pulse.
