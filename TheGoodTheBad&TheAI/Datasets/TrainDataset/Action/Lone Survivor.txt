Hurry up.
Lt's eighteen.
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 1: Ooh!
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 2:
Ríng the bell three tímes,
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 2: Commence!
You don't make ít,
you do ít agaín!
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 1: You ever
been tested this hard
ever in your life?
Never.
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 1:
Wínníng here ís
a conscíous decísíon.
Make up your mínd íf
you want to pass
or choose to faíl.
All right now, gentlemen,
l'm gonna introduce y'all
to something called
"not being able to breathe."
TRAINER: Andrew! Come back.
Come back to the light.
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 1:
All thís shakíng and all
thís cold. Harness ít.
Turn ít ínto aggressíon.
You just proved to
your bodies,
through your mind,
that you can
push yourself further

Go get wet! Run!
SEAL TRAINEE:
l'm at my límít, so...
that's ít.
SEAL INSTRUCTOR:
You sure you want to be here?
MAN: Yes, l do.
Are you absolutely sure?
L'm positive!
SEAL INSTRUCTOR 2:

SEAL INSTRUCTOR 1:
Just fínd an excuse to wín.
Keep goíng.
SEAL 1:
It pays to be a wínner!
SEAL 2:
l líke havíng my buddíes

And l would líke for them

SEAL 3:
These guys are our
band of brothers.
ALL:
Sílent níght
Holy níght
All ís calm
All ís bríght
LUTTRELL:
There's a storm ínsíde of us.
L've heard many team
guys speak of thís.
A burníng.
A ríver.
A dríve.
An unrelentíng
desíre to push yourself
harder and further than
anyone could thínk possíble.
Pushíng ourselves
ínto those cold,
dark corners.
Where the bad thíngs líve.
Where the bad thíngs fíght.
We wanted that Fíght
at the híghest volume.
LUTTRELL: _ loud fíght.
The loudest, coldest, darkest,
most unpleasant of
the unpleasant fíghts.
ls this doable?
Lt's expensive.
How much?
LUTTRELL:
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.
L know.
How much?
L'll find out. Expensive.
You're fucked, man.
l know.
L'm up.
Going down.
Murphy by 1.1.
More than that.
More than that, Marcus.
Fuckin' dude,
l was being generous.
Trust me.
Who won?
Murph. Murph, barely.
By one second.
Barely.
Barely.
LUTTRELL: Head shave?
Head shave or what?
l don't know, you know?
It's something to think about.
Lf l shave his head,
l have to focus on his face.
Face, ears.
Oddly-shaped head.
Well, l don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,
but he has been running his
mouth about beating you.
Really?
Fuck, a head shave is fair.
Axe?
Better shave him.
,
Make him go eat with the E-3s,
work in the chow hall
until it grows back.
LUTTRELL:
Frankie, what do you think?
Why the fuck
wouldn't we shave him?
That's valid.
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?
Let me see you
make a tactical decision
right now.
Well,
l could go both ways on this.
He did lose, but he was close.
And you're Mike Murphy.
You are Mike Murphy.
The Mike Murphy.
L would've expected
a bigger separation.
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.
Patton. Grab my razor.
PATTON: Razor, copy that.
KRISTENSEN: Listen up.
Red Wings' a go.
Tonight, 1800.
Beautiful.
Am l going?
PLO in an hour.
Maybe l'll go.
Lt's a maybe.
l'll give you a maybe.
Stay optimistic.
Boys.
FRANKIE: Hey, what's up?
What the fuck am l doing wrong?
Oh, come on.
L'll tell you what, Shane,
here's your first op.
You ready?
Clean all this up.
The objective of this
mission is to capture
and kill Ahmad Shah.
Bad guy.
Senior Taliban commander
responsíble for
kíllíng Marínes ín
eastern Afghanístan.
A Tier l target.
Lf you want a positive l.D.,
note that Shah
has no earlobes.
MURPHY: Taraq.
His right-hand man.
Seems to do most of
his chief shit for him.
We're going in with
a four-man recon team.
Axelson, you'll be point.
Myself, l'll be second.
Dietz, comms.
Marcus, rear, med.
Axe, give us our route.
AXELSON: We're gonna be moving
up the back side
of this mountain here,
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.
L'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between
three and four hours,
depending upon the gradient
of the terrain
which is that crappy shale.
So please lace up.
First things first.
You're gonna win the fight.
No medicine in a gun fight.
Two weeks ago, Team 8 was near
where we're gonna be.
Capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.
Contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.
Murph's got the satphone.
The angle ofthis
region is very steep.
Expect typical comms problems.
We're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.
Lf we miss two windows,
l'd say wake somebody up.
If not, don't sweat it.
Waypoint one is Budweiser.
Waypoint two is Miller.
Three is Corona.
Four is Heineken.
And for our O.P. 1,
Schlitz Malt Liquor.
And if and when we l.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.
Gentlemen, these are your
Rules of Engagement.
US forces will comply
wíth the Law oF
Armed Conflíct at all tímes.
Use of deadly
force ís authorízed.
Allahu Akbar!
Lf you do come under attack,
use the appropríate force
necessary to deter
or defeat that threat.
KRISTENSEN:
Leaving here at 1800.
Two Chinooks and two Apaches.
We fly here to the L.Z.,
insert
the four-man team right here.
Then we fly 30
minutes to J-Bad.
Here, we'll have 15 team guys
and about a dozen
Marines standing by all night.
When we hear
"Schlitz Malt Liquor",
we're heading back
to Bagram for phase two.
The QRF will
stay here at J-Bad.
Now the Apaches stay
with the Black Hawks.
The movement is so we can get
the 47's back here
ready to bring
up to phrase two,
once you get eyes on Shah.
Oh,
l bringing up
tomorrow night's new guy
presentation to 1400 today,
so that all may
revel and partake.
LUTTRELL:
You better be good, Napoleon.
Fuck.
A lot of moving parts.
We were going to wait
and then she gets her
head into it
and when she gets
her head into something,
that's it.
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.
MURPHY: You know,
you should just
let her do it.
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.
He's afraid of losing
control over his castle.
He's having control issues
'cause he's the one
who's always made
the taste decisions
in the family, right?
No, she's got great taste.
L... l trust her.
LUTTRELL:
Well, what does she like?
DIETZ: Rose Honeydew.
Oh.
MURPHY: Is that a color?
Mmm-mmm.
You better control
that situation.
Lt's very ongoing.
New grass leads to
new bushes by the windows,
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.
New baby.
LUTTRELL: Dude, she's
pregnant? How far along
is she?
You know if it's
a boy or a girl?
No, she's not pregnant.
She's just on a weird journey,
moving through the house,
one room to the next.
LUTTRELL: Sounds expensive.
Sounds pregnant.
Congratulations.
MAN: You're fuckin' late.
Sir, l'm good to go.
No.
You should introduce yourself
and tell us something about
you we don't know.
All right. Petty Officer...
Oh, shut up!
Get out!
Shut the fuck up!
Hey. Settle down.
Give the kid a chance.
Remember what it
was like for you.
Petty Officer...
DIETZ: Who gives a shit!
LUTTRELL: Shut the fuck up!
Mr. Patton, please.
There we go.
More neck.
Come on, dude,
you got to get into it.
Lose yourself.
MAN: Yeah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Really, really bad.
Dude, that was traumatizing.
Can we vote to
push him through?
Because l can't
see that ever again.
Hands up.
Push him through!
l don't know.
Can he say it?
Can you say it?
MAN: Prove it!
l don't want
to watch you dance again.
l really don't.
Can you say it, Mr. Patton?
L can say it, l can say it.
Uh...
MAN: Don't fuck it up.
Come on.
No more fucking around.
Come on.
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.
Seen two whales fuck.
Been to three world fairs.
L even know a man in Thailand
with a wooden cock.
L push more peter

There aín't nothíng l can't do.
No sky too hígh,
no sea too rough,
no muFF too tough.
Learned a lot of
lessons ín my lífe.
Never shoot
a large-calíber man wíth
a small-calíber bullet.
Dríve all kínds of trucks.
Two-bys, four-bys, síx-bys.
And those bíg
mothe_uckers that bend
and go, "sshh-sshh"
when you step on the brakes.
Anythíng ín lífe worth doíng
ís worth overdoíng.
Moderatíon ís for cowards.
L'm a lover, l'm a fíghter,
l'm a UDT Navy SEAL díver.
I'll wíne, díne, íntertwíne,

So íf you're feelíng froggy,
then you betterjump,
because thís frogman's
been there, done that
and ís goíng back for more.
Cheers, boys.
She does not need

How the fuck

L know everythíng, Murphy.
KRISTENSEN: More a Tennessee

HASSLERT: Good copy.

KRISTENSEN:

LUTTRELL: Ooh!

MURPHY: We're too exposed.
What do you think?
Keep Axe at O.P. 1?
Move back twenty-five yards,

MURPHY: _xe,

How is that gonna help me?
Hello?

That means if l cut down
the trees behind the stable,
l get a discount
for your horse.
Do they sell Arabic horses?
First of all, it's not
an Arabic horse, okay?
It's an Arabian horse.
Arabic.
Lt's...
You're from New York, okay?
How much is

Hell of a wedding present.

She's a bridesmaid. Yes.
Did she ask about me?
No.
Mikey, l'm good here.

Copy that.
Lísten up. At 0930,

Marcus, Axe, shut her down.

MURPHY: Rest up, gents.

You're makíng me nauseous.
Mikey, you see this?
What the fuck is this?
Oh, shit.
LUTTRELL: Get down!
Down!
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
AXELSON: Get up.

Talk to the mountain, sir.
Eyes down. Eyes down.
Motherfuck.
You know,

Lt's not a cursed op.
There's no curses.
Lt's iust Afghanistan.
That's all.
J-Bad TOC,
Sergeant Hasslert speaking.
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.
Do you hear me?
Hello.
Sergeant,
this is Spartan O-1.
Yes, yes, l can hear you, sir.
L am calling on
an unsecure line.
L need to speak
to the C.O. immediately.
The C.O.?
That's correct.
Whích C.O., sír?
Commander Kristensen.
Commander Kristensen
isn't here, sir.
Ah, he's at Bagram.
Yes, that's correct, sir.
L need you to transfer me
to Bagram Ouellette TOC.
Now.
Roger that, sir. Stand by.
Ouellette.
Petty Officer Patton.
Patton, Míke Murphy.
You're looking for Mike Murphy?
This is Mike Murphy.
Do you copy?
Mike?
This connection sucks.
What's up, man?
Patton, get me the Skipper now.
He's sleeping, sir.
Wake him the fuck up.
Díd you say wake hím up, sír?
Ríght fuckíng now.
Roger that.
Murph wants me to

Mike Murphy?
Yeah.
That's Mike Murphy?
Well, go get him.
Commander Kristensen?
Commander Kristensen?
Sir, sorry, sir.
L got Lieutenant Murphy
on the phone
for you in the TOC.
He says he
needs to talk to you now.
Which one?
Right there.
Mike? Mike?
Oh, it dropped.
Mike?
Lt's dead.
What did he say?
Uh, iust that
he needed to talk to you.
Why is Murphy
calling on a satphone?
No idea.
Are we having comms problems
with Spartan O-1?
We were good for a while,
but we've missed
two windows now, sir.
Two.
Try him back!
For fuck's sake.
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.
Well, we could light
the goats on fire,
smoke signal our way
out of here.
Yeah, l could walk down
to the village,
ask to borrow a phone.
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.
Afghan Dirt Brown,
Goat Skin Blond.
Shit, she'll dig that
a hell of a lot more than,
what is it,
fucking Honey Cream?
Sit down. Sit down!
Way l see it,
we got three options.
One, we let them go, hike up.
We'll probably be
found in less than an hour.
Two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.
They'll probably
be eaten by fucking wolves,
or freeze to death.
Three?
We terminate the compromise.
Shah's down there.
We let them go, we're
letting him go. Mission fails.
No, Mikey.
L don't like it.
l don't fucking
like it at all.
What are we gonna do?
We gonna kill them? Huh?
Okay, we kill them, right?
What, then what?
Fucking bury 'em?
They get found, then what?
Then what?
What do you mean, then what?
And then what?
You know then what.
What do you think?
This shit's gonna be private?
Huh? It's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.
CNN, okay?
"SEALs kill kids."
That's the fucking story
forever.
Lt's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.
We do what we do.
What we have to do.
This is
the fucking Navy
and you're the fucking boss,
so you make
the fucking call, sir.
Shah killed 20
Marines last week.
Twenty.
We let him go,
will die next week.
Forty more
the week after that.
Our job is to stop Shah.
Why do these men have
the right to dictate
how we do ourjob?
Rules of Engagement says
we cannot touch them.
L understand.
And l don't care.
L care about you.
L care about you.
L care about you.
L care about you.
L don't want your
mom seeing your head,
your decapitated
head on Al Jazeera.
That is Shah.
L don't see it that way.
Where do you
think he's running to?
Got guys in Leavenworth
doing 20 for taking
home trophy guns.
What do you think
they're gonna do
for two fucking kids
and an old fucking man?
Fucking look at them, man.
They fucking hate us.
Look, at him. That's not
a kid, that's a soldier.
That's death. Look at death.
LUTTRELL: We can't do it.
AXELSON: Look at that soldier.
They are unarmed prisoners.
And the second
they run down there,
we got 200 hajís on our backs.
Tie 'em up.
Tie 'em up.
Let's get the fuck
out of here.
We can't just
fucking leave 'em,
let 'em go!
L thought you were
standing by waiting
for your fucking orders?
L am standing by
waiting for my fucking orders.
What do you think
that radio's for?
They're not
calling Domino's Pizza.
L know what
the fucking radio's for.
That radio's fucking Tali.
Lt's a cell phone
to the Taliban.
So you just think
it'll just be
our little secret? Huh?
That's a warrior.
Schwack them.
We cannot do that.
This is a soft compromise.
You want to go to Leavenworth?
You don't know how
many hajís they have
down there, man.
Don't let him influence you.
Marcus, l'm iust saying,
you can't just say...
Look at that child.
Make up your fucking mind
and don't let him
influence you.
Schwack them.
DIETZ: Mikey,
it's your fucking call.
l ain't fucking voting.
This is not a vote.
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.
So we're going to
pack up everything.
We're gonna cut them loose
and we're gonna
make this peak.
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.
When we get these comms up,
we're gonna call for
extract and we're going home.
Roger that, sir.
DIETZ: Roger that.
Roger.

Uh, sir, this is Erik.
For your S.A., we have missed
three comm windows
with Spartan O-1.
Last known comms were at 0700.
Why am l hearing this

Sir, we expected

Murphy and l discussed

he missed two windows.
Ls there

Sir, l've told you

L will call you when l
