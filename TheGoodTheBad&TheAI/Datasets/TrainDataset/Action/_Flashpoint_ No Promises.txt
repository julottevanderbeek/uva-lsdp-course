Thank you.
I can't believe
you remember that.
What, are you kidding me?
You singing
"Everybody Hurts."
Jules:
Oh sorry.
Yeah, my R.E.M phase.
Well, I couldn't take
my eyes off you, so...
Are you sure it didn't have
anything to do
with what I was wearing
maybe?
Uh, black leather miniskirt,
white tank top...
Seriously though,
you guys were good.
You coulda went
on the road.
I don't think so.
Yeah,
I got a confession.
Your best show -
five am,
morning after graduation,
on the roof
of the gym.
What?
You just got dumped
by Curtis
at that party...
Oh God,
I don't believe this.
You took your guitar,
you went up to roof
and you came up
with this...
Really gentle song-
you were up there?
I'm sorry.
It's just after I heard that
I thought...
I felt like I knew you.
You know there's this
wine tasting thing,
Niagara on the lake,
next weekend.
Um...
I mean we don't have
to stay over,
it could just be
a day trip.
I was just thinking 'cause
we've been seeing each other
for a while.
I... I just-
What was that?
That was gunfire.
Steve:
Hold on.
Steve: Hey watch!
Jules:
Stop!
Man:
Somebody's been shot.
Jules:
Winnie, it's Jules.
Oh hey, how are you enjoying
your day off?
Inside the Sultan Grill
on the Danforth.
Guys! Guys!
Sam: What's happening?
Winnie: Are you okay?
We're outside the restaurant
right now.
Is the shooter still inside?
I can't see.
Someone's shot, Jules.
I gotta get in there.
Sam:
Jules, hang tight!
We're coming!
Team one, hot call!
Suit up!
He may be dead
before they get here.
Jules:
You don't go in there.
Waitress: Eric...
Gunman: Now one more time!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
tell me where he is!
I don't know!
Where's Riyaz?
I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.
Where are your hands?
Where are your hands?!
No, no cell phones.
Hey, all cell phones
on the floor now.
Now! Go get 'em!
Collect them!
Anyone caught attempting
to communicate with him
will be shot.
Do you understand me?!
It's gonna be okay.
Total communication blackout.
All right.
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!
He just wants to make sure
that he's okay.
Okay, well get away.
Come on get away.
Get away from him!
You, lock it.
Lock the door!
You, barricade it -
tables and chairs.
Nobody's leaving
until I get some answers.
All right.
Okay.
You - knives, forks, uh...
Corkscrews,
any sharp implements.
If I find anything
that can be used as a weapon...
Go!
Come on, come on, come on!
That's good.
Get against the wall.
Hands where I can see 'em.
Go! Move!
Set up a perimeter.
Get the uniforms
to keep these people back.
Parker:
We're dealing with at least
one shooter.
Wordy:
How many hostages?
Limited vantage.
Looks like the front doors
are barricaded.
Maybe Jules can feed us
information from inside.
Sam:
No, if that gunman finds out
Jules is a cop...
All right.
Hey, quiet!
Hey, hey!
You guys clear outta here!
Go!
I want everyone to keep quiet,
I gotta think.
You, on the floor.
Hands behind the head.
You know what this place is,
right?
It's, it's a restaurant.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It looks very much like
a restaurant, but do you...
Do you know what it is?
What're you looking at?!
She says there's one gunman,
Who's Riyaz?
On it.
You told him not to come
because I'm here,
didn't you?
I don't even know who you mean.
I gotta try to talk to him.
Woman:
Hey, you stay
where you are.
I'm gonna stay
right here.
All right, good.
My name's Jules.
What's your?
Oh...
You're looking for somebody
named Riyaz?
Yeah, what,
you know him?
No, I don't.
But maybe I could help you
find him.
Oh well, he knows him.
And if he had just told me
where he was when I asked,
then this wouldn't have
happened.
No, oh no.
No, no, okay...
Uh, everybody...
Go! Go!
Everybody against the door!
Get to the front.
Go. Get to the front.
Go now!
He's lining up hostages
against the window.
He's making a human shield.
Sam?
No vantage.
I'm coming down.
Hey, hey,
what're you doing?
Sir, this man is losing
a lot of blood.
He needs to go
to the hospital.
I said no one's leaving.
He's a paramedic.
and then you can find Riyaz.
Yeah.
Just hang in there, buddy,
hang in.
Okay,
he's barely conscious.
Look, I'm gonna need
some napkins,
clean water
and plastic wrap.
I can get them.
Okay, go.
Come on, come on.
Move fast!
Okay, we know who
we're looking for.
The owner of the restaurant
is Riyaz Fayad.
Parker:
Good, now let's find out
who's got a beef with him.
What's going on, Eddie?
Might be able to feed
a snake cam through that.
All right, go for it.
Let's do it.
Is Eric gonna be okay?
He's got decreased breath
sounds on the left side.
What does that mean?
His lung collapsed.
Oh my God.
Look, he needs chest
decompression.
Wouldn't happen to have a kit
in your purse, do you?
Can you improvise?
Yeah, but I need a pen,
I need some vodka...
A knife.
Sir?
A knife.
What do you think I am?
An idiot?
Sir, I promise.
We're gonna hand it back
as soon as we're done,
please.
All right.
You try anything,
I'm gonna shoot her.
Waitress:
I'm gonna get the vodka.
Gunman:
Okay, go.
Gunman: Just go!
Jules: I'm going.
Jules: Here you go.
Steve: Thanks.
Steve:
Okay, the knife.
Jules:
Mm-hmm.
You got it?
Look, I'm sorry
for getting us into this.
You were just trying
to help.
Okay.
Oh my God.
Okay, hand me the pen.
Okay.
Yeah.
it's gonna protect the wound.
Pass me the knife.
All right.
Angle it
a little to the left.
I'm in.
Ed: Spike?
Spike: Eyes are good.
I don't see any other wounded.
There's a lot of buzz
on Riyaz Fayad.
they're all suggesting
he's a leader
of an extremist terror cell.
Anti-terror unit
investigating?
Spike:
Yeah, the details
are classified;
Eddie, Fayad's being
investigated for terrorism.
You think he's connected
to the gunman?
Spike.
Yeah, sending the address
to your PDAs right now.
Let's move it.
On your knees.
Get on your knees.
Parker:
All right, that's it,
I'm calling in.
Woman:
I don't know,
I don't know.
Jules:
I bet that's the police.
Maybe they wanna help.
Gunman:
Yeah, you think so,
but, you know, no.
In the big picture,
they're just puppets.
There's nothing they can do.
Okay, but maybe you can help
show them the big picture.
Uh... okay, fine.
Answer it.
So much for your day off,
huh?
Jules:
Yes. There's a gentleman here,
he's looking for a man
named Riyaz Fayad,
it's very important.
Get me his name, Jules.
They'll help you find Riyaz
if you give them your name.
It's Davis Lagosto.
I'll check him out.
Why do you need
to find Riyaz?
Riyaz Fayad is using
this restaurant as a front
for his terrorist operations.
Tell him Fayad's being
investigation by the ATU.
Riyaz is already under
investigation by the ATU -
the anti-terror unit.
And if he's a terrorist,
they're gonna do everything
they can
to bring him to justice.
No, by then
it'll be too late.
Why?
It's gonna happen
any day now.
What's happening?
He and his people,
they're gonna be planting bombs
on the subway.
How does he know this?
you have to tell
the police.
Get back!
Okay, I'm back.
What're you doing?
I thought you were helping me.
I am.
I'm talking to the police.
Davis: Put the gun down!
Parker: What's going on, Jules?
Okay, put it down.
Put down the gun!
I don't have a gun.
Put down the gun,
or I'm gonna have
to shoot you!

Put it down now!
I'm putting it down.
Slowly, slowly.
Get over there!
Come on.
Get back.
All right,
hands above your head.
Wait, he didn't hang up
the phone.
Thank you, Davis.
We still have ears.
Parker:
Substance abuse?
A history of violence.
Also served time
in a psych ward.
What's he been diagnosed with?
I can't get details.
I'd have to get clearance.
Let's see if we can track down
his family.
So this terrorist attack...
Parker:
Could be delusion,
could be there's a grain
of truth.
Riyaz Fayad is being
investigated.
Police! Riyaz Fayad,
open up the door.
Do it now!
Police!
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're here to talk
to Riyaz Fayad.
What do you want
with him?
Ed:
We need to ask him
a few questions.
Sorry, he's not here
right now. Hey!
Ed:
Police! Wordy.
Mrs. Fayad:
Leave him alone!
Ed:
Police!
Wordy:
Police! Stop right there!
Police!
Ed:
Right there! Right there!
Let's see some hands, now!
Don't come any closer!
Mr. Fayad, I'm officer Lane,
this is officer wordsworth.
Now we just need to talk,
but you need to put that
weapon down now.
Sir, we just wanna
talk to you.
I haven't done anything
wrong!
Mr. Fayad.
We have to consider that
a threat, sir.
I know how this works!
You capture me like an animal -
no lawyer,
no rights -
fly me off to some other country
to be tortured!
Mrs. Fayad:
Please, Riyaz, don't!
Mrs. Fayad, back in the house.
Back in the house!
Cashmira, stay back.
Mr. Fayad,
listen to your wife.
You knock on my door
with assault weapons
for a conversation?
We will put the guns away.
Please, put the pipe down.
Cashmira: Please, Riyaz.
Ed: Just help us out here.
Don't make this
any worse.
That's it.
Thank you, sir. Wordy?
Drop it, drop it.
Right down!
Ed:
That's it.
Wordy:
Turn around.
Up against the fence.
Just tell me if he's okay,
will you?
and he's holding
several people hostage
inside a restaurant.
Oh, my God.
Davis, my boy.
Oh.
Yeah.
He was diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic
when he was 15.
So he suffers
from delusions?
Jules:
Hey, Davis, how you doing?
Are you okay?
Riyaz should've been here
by now,
Well, the police
are looking for him.
Yeah, well,
we're running out of time.
inside your restaurant
looking for you,
now we need to know why.
His name is Davis Lagosto.
You ever seen him?
No, I've never seen him
before.
Soldiers are all out
in the middle east, you know,
but where are they
when we need them here?
Why do we need soldiers
here?
Davis:
There are terror operatives
in every major city
in North America.
Of course we need them here.
Sounds really scary.
He thought his mother
was under orders to kill him.
So he came into our bedroom
one night
while we were sleeping,
with a rope,
tied it around her neck,
tried to strangle her.
I'm sorry.
That sounds terrifying, sir.
But we loved him,
you know?
There are dozens
of sleeper cells
all across this country.
It's not just al-Qaeda.
It's Hezbollah and Hamas.
on the subway system.
Of course.
'Cause I'm a "terrorist."
Ever since those
news reports came out,
they've threatened my wife
and my child.
They painted hate messages
on my home
and my restaurant -
all based on nothing.
He could be living
next door to you
and you wouldn't even
know it.
And you feel like
it's your responsibility
to do something about it.
I don't have a choice!
It really helped
for a while.
Davis managed
to get through college,
got a degree
in chemical engineering.
What,
the drug stopped working?
Robert:
Yeah, he had a breakdown
after college,
had to be hospitalized.
Ed:
All right, Mr. Fayad,
can we take a look
at those threats?
Gladly.
Wordy, uncuff him.
Ma'am?
Is he on any medication
right now?
I haven't seen my son
in over a year.
Why not, sir?
he got very angry;
he thought I was trying
to have him committed.
I tried to get him
to come home, but...
He didn't want any part of me.
Okay, where's he living now?
Do you know?
Robert:
He's, uh, at Harmony House.
It's a group home.
St. George Street.
Okay, just hang on one second,
Mr. Lagosto.
Get a hold of Harmony House.
I'm sure he's got
a social worker there.
Let's get in touch
with him.
Parker: Mr. Irwin?
Clive: Yeah.
How're you doing?
I'm sergeant Parker.
Thank you for coming.
Will you follow me
please, sir?
So you're Davis's
primary social worker?
Yeah, I've known him
for over two years.
Look,
this is all my fault.
Davis is my responsibility.
Look, we understand
that Davis has been charged
with assault in the past.
Now,
these violent outbursts,
do they happen often?
He's not some kind of monster.
He's sick.
Yeah, I understand that,
Mr. Irwin.
Look, paranoid schizophrenics
are prone to suspicion.
If they feel threatened,
they sometimes lash out
to protect themselves.
But Davis believes
that terrorists
are planning an attack
on the city.
What did he say?
He said that restaurant
is a front for a terror cell.
Has he mentioned
Riyaz Fayad before?
I don't think so,
but he's been talking a lot
about terrorists lately.
Do you know what might have
triggered that?
Terrorism's all over the news
these days.
Bombings in Madrid,
Chechnya...
Yeah.
Eric?
What's happening?
His pulse is thready.
There's no breath sounds.
Angela:
Oh my God.
Come on, Eric,
hang in there!
Steve.
Help, please!
Tell him to keep going.
I'm sorry, it's...
No!
Man: Oh my God.
Davis: Hey!
Is he dead?
Yes.
Oh.
Oh?
Okay, Angela...
That's all
you have to say?!
He harboured
a known terrorist.
Riyaz is not a terrorist!
What's wrong with you?!
Okay, she's escalating him now.
We need to stay really calm
right now.
You come in here
on a Muslim witch hunt...
No, you're not listening to me,
all right?
This is a front
for a terrorist operation.
You are not listening to me.
So then what does that
make me?
All right, oh my God,
you're one of them.
You're a black widow.
So now I'm a terrorist too?!
Aw crap!
Davis:
Everybody, get back!
Stay back, everybody!
Davis, what do you see?
All right, she's got a bomb.
She's about to detonate a bomb.
Angela:
We're all terrorists!
Get down!
She's got a bomb!
All right.
Hey.
Shots fired!
Davis: Why'd you do that?
Jules: Are you okay?
I think so.
Oh my gosh!
Steve?
It's Steve.
He's been shot.
Steve.
I'm okay.
Just lay still,
Angela.
This back door leads
right into the basement.
You're just covering on this,
all right?
She knows what she's doing.
I know she does.
Just saying.
Yes, sir.
Jules:
We gotta stop the bleeding.
Steve:
It's okay.
I got it, I got it.
Get back, get back!
Get back!
Shut up! Shut up!
Hands above your head!
Hands above your head!
All right, I know that
you're afraid right now, Davis.
All right,
we have to find something
She's not gonna hurt you.
She's got a bomb!
Are you blind?!
Patron:
Oh my God.
We gotta find a way
to get past his delusions.
He said we needed soldiers here.
Maybe I can talk to him as one.
But, boss, this place has serious
security for a restaurant;
After 9-11, a lot
of middle eastern businesses
have been targets for vandals.
I'm gonna have
to torch my way through.
Riyaz:
This brick was thrown
through our window.
Die Arab pig.
Sayid was in the room
when it happened.
Go back
to the middle east.
He was born in Vancouver.
Why didn't you report this?
You think anyone cares
about death threats
against a suspected
terrorist?
Why were you accused
in the first place?
Back in, uh... 2004,
I started donating money
to an Islamic charity.
I was told
it was a scholarship fund
for underprivileged kids.
I found out later that
the charity was a front
used to fund
terrorist activities,
including the London bombings.
And from that they assumed
you were the leader
of a terrorist cell?
I convinced a lot of other
members of my mosque
to donate
to the same charity.
We thought we were doing
something good.
ATU dragged us from our homes
in the middle of the night.
They froze our bank accounts,
confiscated our passports...
Once it got leaked
to the press,
that's when all the threats
started to happen.
Excuse me one second.
Any intel
on a possible attack?
No. And they checked
with other agencies -
no chatter, nothing.
And Mr. Fayad?
Spike:
Well, he's gonna be on
a no-fly list for a while,
but they're wrapping up
their investigation.
He's been cleared
of any wrongdoing.
The ATU is clearing you.
What?
Really?
Oh my God.
Oh my God! It's over!
Hey, Spike,
a lot of these email threats
Don't try to be the tough guy.
I know what it feels like.
I've been shot before.
I know how much pain you're in.
So, how do you like the date
so far?
You really know how to keep
a girl on her toes, huh?
Wait 'til you see what...
Ungh!
I have planned
for the next one.
Woman:
We can't. He's just gonna
start shooting again.
Man:
That's why we gotta do it fast.
Disarm him.
Woman 2:
There are a lot of us
and only one of him.
Steve, you're shivering.
The room's spinning.
Your heart's racing
really fast.
Yeah, I'm cold.
I'm just going into shock.
I'm gonna go try
and get your jacket.
N-no...
Okay,
I want you to look at me.
I want you to look at me.
I want you to keep
talking to me, okay?
I'm an idiot.
You're not.
It's not your fault.
No, I mean, I shouldn't have
waited so long to ask you out.
Let's save the deathbed
confession
for 50 years from now,
okay?
You gonna be there?
Hey, guys,
those threats against Riyaz?
You were right;
the I.P. address traces back
to Davis's group home.
So he did make those threats.
Hey, Ed,
take a look at this one.
Okay, boss,
listen to this.
Taste of his own medicine...
Think Davis built a bomb?
His father mentioned
that he had a degree
in chemical engineering.
So why show up at the restaurant
with a gun?
Maybe he'd already
planted it somewhere;
he wanted to take the leader out
personally.
Okay, boss, we're gonna head
to the group home.
Okay, Eddie, check Davis's room,
check everywhere.
Find out what he's building
and who he's targeting.
Mr. Fayad?
Riyaz:
Yes, officer?
An officer's gonna take you
downtown for processing.
Uh, I'll go with you.
No,
you and Sayid go to the mosque.
Pray for Eric and the others
at the restaurant.
Cashmira:
Okay.
Man:
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Get back!
Sam, hostages are turning
on him.
Get in there now!
Get back against the wall
now,
or I'll shoot you all
one by one.
Jules:
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapons.
Sam:
Everybody do what the man says!
I got this area of operations
contained.
Go back to where you were, now,
all of you!
Who are you?
Master Corporal Sam Braddock,
Special Forces.
I'm here to help.
You knew this place
was a front for terrorists?
He's sensitive to deception.
I know what it's like
to feel afraid;
I served two tours
in Afghanistan.
I know what it's like
to walk down the street,
You feel helpless,
like you're never
gonna be safe.
That's what they want -
all of us to live
in a state of fear.
Yeah, that's why we gotta
fight back.
Davis and Sam:
Sam:
Settle down.
Davis:
What are you doing?!
You lied to me!
You lied to me!
Subject in custody.
Parker:
Good work, guys.
Good work.
Thank you.
E.M.S.
We need E.M.S. in here now.
Eddie, you find anything
at the group home?
Davis is building
something here...
Have a look.
Those fire extinguishers?
Uh huh.
They're all empty.
Watches, pesticides...
What's that on the floor?
Castor beans.
Talk to me, Spike.
Castor beans
and pesticides -
major components in both ricin
and sarin.
Nerve gas.
Fire extinguishers
hold compressed gas,
watch is the timer...
He's made a chemical bomb
and it's already out there.
Parker:
Sam?
How is he?
Davis?
Davis, I'm sergeant Parker.
How are you doing?
You doing okay?
Look, I want you to know
that you're safe.
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.
Okay?
But we could really use
your help right now.
We know that made
some kind of chemical bomb
and we need to know
where it is.
Davis, a bomb like that
could kill a lot
of innocent people.
Sam:
I don't think we're gonna
get anything out of him.
Parker:
Get him to the hospital,
regulate his meds.
Parker:
Keep an eye on Mr. Lagosto.
When he becomes coherent,
you question him again, okay?
Eddie, couldn't get anything.
You need to tear
that place apart
and figure out where
his next target may have been.
Let the social worker, Clive,
know that he's there,
he's safe,
Boss, the social worker's
not here.
Boss, I got something.
All right,
I'm on my way.
Nah, nah-nah.
You don't have to come with me.
Jules:
You're going into surgery.
You need somebody there
when you wake up.
Yeah, there's a bomb out there;
The team needs you.
Jules: Are you sure?
Steve: Yeah, I'll be all right.
Okay,
I'm gonna come by later.
You better suit up.
I got into Davis's computer.
Those threats against Riyaz?
What does that mean,
Spike?
It means someone was using
his computer
as a proxy server.
Davis didn't send
those threats.
Someone was setting him up.
Can you trace it?
Yeah, I'm running a tunneling
program right now.
Clive Irwin.
His social worker.
Parker: Eddie.
Ed: Boss?
Wordy, let's get this open.
Ed:
Boss, it looks like Clive's
been conducting
his own investigation
of Mr. Fayad.
What'd you find?
We've got articles
on domestic terrorism,
surveillance photos
on Mr. Fayad
and other Muslims.
Suspected cell members.
Clive's the one who's paranoid
about terrorism.
a few years ago.
Ed:
Did he ever discuss it
with Davis?
It's funny,
he never talked
about it to anyone,
and then a few months ago
they were playing chess...
When the bomb went off,
the train split in half.
She was thrown
onto the tracks.
I tried to go to her,
but I couldn't stand up.
Both my legs were broken.
I didn't know
if she was alive or dead.
Her face was turned away.
I just kept
calling her name.
I'm almost convinced
it's been a bad dream.
They say that Riyaz Fayad
was connected
to those suicide bombers.
There must be a way
to stop him.
I mean you can't blame Clive
for how he feels.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
Sounds like Clive's been
whispering in Davis's ear
for months.
Feeding his paranoia
about an attack
and convincing him
to build a bomb.
Well, Davis probably had
no idea
his friend was using him
as a weapon.
Setting him up
to take the fall.
driving away 20 minutes ago.
Where'd he go?
No idea.
Well, if he was using Davis
to keep his own hands clean,
why would he take the bomb
himself?
'Cause Davis can't now
and the job isn't done.
It's gotta be the mosque.
Remember?
Clive didn't just threaten
Riyaz.
He said, "you and your followers
are gonna get a taste
of your own medicine."
He thinks it's their base
of operations.
Spike:
Lawrence and Avenue Road.
Zelovitsky: Sergeant Parker?
Parker: Yeah.
Dr. Zelovitsky,
I'm with Hazmat.
I'm heading up
the medical team.
Any idea what kind of toxin
we're dealing with?
It could be a nerve Agent,
maybe a derivative of ricin
or sarin.
It's hard to be specific
'cause it's a home brew.
We need to prepare
for hemorrhaging,
convulsions,
even fatalities.
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.
Zelovitsky: We'll be ready.
Parker: Thank you.
Ed:
Okay, Spike,
what do we got?
Looks like Davis outfitted
the extinguishers
with artificial heads.
He presses
a manual detonator,
the cylinder will blow
releasing the gas.
Okay, can you disarm it?
Spike:
Yeah, if we find it in time.
He could release the toxin.
Okay, absolute stealth,
guys.
Spike, wordy,
you take the back.
Sam and Jules, west.
Boss, let's take the east.
Let's move it.
Mommy will be right over,
okay?
Can I help you?
Masks on.
Looks like the prayer room.
Ed:
Does he have the bomb?
Affirmative.
I have the solution.
If the bomb hits the floor,
it'll blow.
Ed:
Spike, shut down
the ventilation system.
If the toxin's released,
we can keep it contained.
Copy that.
I'm going on in.
Ed:
Police!
Team:
Police! SRU! Police!
Ed:
Right there!
Everybody exit the building.
Exit the room now,
do it now!
Nobody move.
Parker:
Clive, just put it down.
Put it down,
and move away slowly.
I don't expect you
to believe me.
Someone has to stop them.
before you do anything
that you might regret here.
No they haven't!
Don't play games with me.
None of them have links
to the terrorists
that were responsible
for your wife's death.
Is that what you really want?
Is that what Laura
would want?
If that's what it takes.
Put it down.
Clive!
Ed:
Everybody get down
on the ground!
Everybody out now!
Wordy:
Okay, through the doors
as quickly as you can!
Please wait,
I have to find Sayid.
Clive:
Ungh!
Sayid:
Ed:
Wordy, we gotta get to Sayid.
Let's go!
We need these people contained.
Everyone needs
to be sprayed down,
that includes you!
Ed:
I hear ya, doc.
As soon as everyone's safe.
Zelovitsky:
Straight over to the blue tent.
Watch your step.
People will be there
to help you.
Wordy:
Keep going, keep going!
Ed:
Go! Go! Let's go!
Get outta here!
Sayid!
Come on.
I got ya, I got ya.
Come on.
Wordy:
Let's go.
We need some help!
Let's go!
Let's go, right here!
Come on!
Cashmira:
Oh my God, Sayid!
Ed:
It's okay.
Doc!
Baby!
Resps are shallow.
I need five milligrams
of atropine.
Ed:
They're gonna do everything
they can.
Cashmira:
Sayid, baby,
mommy's right here.
Come on, come on,
let's go!
Parker:
Thanks, buddy.
I hear you made a call
on Riyaz's behalf.
Yeah.
Boss, he only threatened us
because he was scared.
He thought we were
the rendition squad.
He saw what he feared
the most.
And he wasn't
the only one today
who something
that wasn't there.
Spike:
Hey, update from the hospital.
Five people still in serious
condition,
What about the boy - Sayid?
Doing okay.
Thanks, Spike.
Yeah.
Hey.
How're you feeling?
Better...Now.
Can I just say something?
Sure.
I've been doing a lot
of thinking...
Just about, uh,
the big picture.
Yeah. I have too.
Future and stuff.
And what I'm guessing is...
Our big pictures
aren't the same.
'Cause you're in mine,
but, uh...
I don't think I'm in yours.
Hey, it's okay.
It's all good.
There's no regrets.
Well...
Almost no regrets.
What do you mean?
Never got to finish
our ice cream.
Both:
Ow.
Just one favour?
Anything.
Promise me...
Keep singing.
