Stand back.
Shocking at 360.
- Clear!
- You're killing him!
Previously,
on
My mom is up for parole,
and I'm trying
to help her get out.
I just didn't want you to think
I was blowing you off.
You don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna tell
anybody at work.
This is our thing.
Nobody else's.
You don't get to come back,
married and pregnant,
saying that you miss me.
You walked away.
- Did you start that fire?
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing
with Ernie?
I said, what are you
doing with that kid?
I've never seen anyone
return to full duty
- after this surgery.
- Rene, she's transferring
to Madrid for her job
and found a great rehab unit.
- How long you staying?
- I'm moving there.
Oh.
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.
- Come on.
- No!
Wow.
Do you mind
taking our picture?
Sure.
Apartment fire.
Ten-car pile up.
- Hand caught in a machine.
- Okay, all right.
In Madrid,
it is going to be,
um, tapas, tapas,
dance club,
and, um,
Catholic church.
You think I can dance?
Well, I can dance
and you can just watch.
That, I can do.
- I've never done that before.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Well, then I guess
this is gonna be the first
- of many new things then, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it?
I met this doctor.
- A doctor?
- Not like that.
I just, um...
Well, I put out
some feelers
to my medical contacts
and, um,
it turns out that
the Chief of orthopedics
over at River Forest Hospital
is pioneering some kind of
experimental spinal surgery,
and he wants to meet you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe this will help you
get to Madrid even sooner.
Chief Boden.
Do you remember me?
- Ernie.
- Yeah.
What's going on?
You okay?
No.
Talk to me.
Where are you?
Ernie.
Ernie.
Ernie.
Hardware store.
Not good.
Cruz, Mills,
vent the roof.
Hardware store's got
propane tanks, accelerants.
Go, go, go!
Dispatch 35,
battalion 25's on scene.
Copy that, 25.
Got one down.
Herrmann, take his legs.
- No pulse.
- Not breathing.
Fire's out, Chief.
Looks like
another dumpster fire.
Chicago Fire S01E13
"Warm and Dead"
Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio
- What's up?
- Door's jammed.
I told Chief we needed
to grease this puppy
- before the weather turned.
- And what, he ignored you?
No, he told me to do it,
but I forgot.
I've been preoccupied.
Weren't you and Cindy
using protection?
We've got
four kids, Mouch.
I was counting on my sperm
being too tired
to make the swim.
Well, I'm gonna
head inside
and check the levels
on the hot chocolate.
Yeah, I'm gonna
provide back-up.
You know, my grandmother
had this garage door
that was always stuck
So one time I tell
my brother nick,
I say, "Go inside
and grab some butter."
- What?
- We got a rule.
You tell a story
that we've all heard
a million times,
we raise our hand,
you gotta shut up,
no questions asked.
That's actually impolite
and insulting.
Like that's on us.
I haven't heard the story.
Mills, let's go.
Where are you guys going?
Oh, I asked Cruz
to give me driving lessons.
I'm actually next in line
to drive 81.
You know that.
Lieutenant?
Not now, Otis.
Hey, I... I got this dog here,
if anyone wants it.
Don't even think about it.
Had a dog over at 80
when I was there.
Still have the teeth marks
in my ankle to prove it.
My dad says he's gonna
throw it in the river
if I don't get rid of it.
I'll take it, or at least I can find
a home for it or something.
He likes bacon.
Well, there's that.
Does he have a name?
Aw, dad,
can we keep it?
Huh, can we?
Can we? Can we?
Keep what?
The dog.
The kid's dad
was gonna drown it
- if we didn't take him.
- He can't stay.
I got a call at 67
over at Morningside.
They need relief
for the next two shifts.
- I'll do it.
- What?
That's the slowest house
in the city.
I'll do it.
Oh, what the hell?
You've got a
medical furlough, Severide.
That means you're medically
required to be out drinking.
Yeah, well...
this may be more
than just a furlough.
I'm moving to Spain
with Renee.
Between your history
with us
and your father's
distinguished career,
I can get you
arson investigation.
Or the academy.
Your choice.
I appreciate it, Chief,
I do.
But I'm leaving.
Kelly...
Just sleep on it.
I have.
Hey.
You okay?
You were right about Ernie.
He called,
said he was in trouble,
and then he hung up.
Right before we responded
to another dumpster fire.
I don't know where
to find him.
You tried
to help him, Chief.
- Did I?
- You reached out to him.
You invited him in.
Kelly, I saw him
with this man...
Everything about it
felt wrong.
And you handed it over
to the police.
And what have they done, huh?
Nothing.
Hey, I must have
misheard Cap,
because he said something
about you going to Spain.
Yeah. I was gonna
tell you this morning,
but... I missed you.
How long
have you known this?
A day.
Maybe two.
Truck 81.
Ambulance 61.
Infant shooting.
My baby!
My baby's been shot.
Baby!
You called the cops?
You've been shot, baby.
Put down that gun.
- Aah!
- Whoa, take it easy.
Shut up
and stay away from me!
I'm not going back to jail.
We're not the cops.
- This was self-defense.
- Of course it was.
You stay where you are.
Are you gonna shoot me
for helping your mom?
Fire department!
Tell 'em to stop bangin'!
Tell 'em to stop, or I'm gonna blow a hole
right through that door!
Dawson? Shay?
You can't carry a taser.
Yeah, well,
tell that to baby.
Baby here, uh,
coldcocked his mom
and then tripped
and bumped his head.
Baby?
Where in code of conduct book
does it say
you can't carry a taser?
Page one.
Oh, I should
totally read that someday.
Hey, Otis, remember to bring
some reading materials
with you to Morningside.
Ten bucks you sell
more Morningside t-shirts
to tourists
than you get calls.
Wager denied.
Yo, Dawson, hold up.
Yo, I'm sorry about before.
It's just that
on shift, it's...
Oh, stop it.
It's all right.
It's just...
You know that
it drives me crazy.
We'll figure it out.
Text me after
you get some rest.
Sounds good.
Mm.
Do you wanna
get breakfast?
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Wow, look at you.
You look like
you're about to pop.
Yeah, a few more weeks.
Thank you.
I heard
if you eat eggplant,
the baby comes right out.
I moved out.
What?
I told Daniel
it wasn't gonna work. Ever.
And, I, uh...
I moved back in
with my parents.
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.
I mean, it's exactly
where I imagined my life at 30,
back with Barb and Gene
in my room,
- with the no doubt poster.
- Right.
- Yeah.
- And don't forget pregnant.
Well, I know
what you're thinking.
What's that?
That the way I live my life
finally caught up with me.
That's not
what I'm thinking.
And you would be right.
Anyway, um,
I just came back
'cause I wanted to say
thank you again.
I mean,
you were a friend to me
when I did not deserve one.
Forget Gene and Barb.
Stay with me.
N... That's not
why I came back.
No, end of discussion.
And you don't wanna get on
the wrong side of my
Trust me.
She's got this look
that she'll throw you
when she's aggravated.
That means tread lightly.
Yeah, I can see that.
I'm gonna speak up for my mom
at the hearing today.
And how does
your sister feel?
Like I'm a traitor.
She's spoken against
my mom's release every year,
which is all the board
needs to hear to deny parole.
Ugh. That's a tough one.
Yeah.
You want me
to come with you today?
Ah, you never know how long
these things are gonna go.
It could be a few hours
before we even get inside.
I'm coming.
Chief, you have a call.
It sounds urgent.
Okay, stand by.
Here he is.
This is Chief Boden.
I'm in trouble.
Ernie, where are you?
Uncle Ray makes me do it.
I know.
Just tell me where you are.
He'd kill me
if he knew I called you.
I will not
let that happen.
Ernie, please,
let me help you.
Ernie.
Just tell me
where you are.
In front of some store
on South Halsted
and Marquette.
Okay. Don't move.
I am on my way.
Ernie?
Ernie!
We take parts of bone
and cartilage from one vertebra
and fuse it onto the next.
And then we inject
your own platelets
into the area,
which increases healing.
Recovery time
could be four weeks
instead of one year.
How come
I didn't hear about this
from my other surgeon?
This isn't covered
by an H.M.O.
It's experimental.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
There are real risks here,
including
partial paralysis.
Partial paralysis?
I am so sorry.
I, um... I guess I didn't realize
how risky it was.
Hey.
If I'm gonna risk anything,
I'll risk it on you and me
in Madrid.
Is there anyone present
who would like to speak
either on behalf of
or in opposition to
Nancy Annalyn Casey's
request for parole?
Yes.
My name is Matthew Casey.
I'm Nancy's son.
I'd like to speak, please.
In four years, you've never
spoken before, Mr. Casey.
Why now?
What's changed?
Well, uh,
when I was seven,
I, uh, I stole a baseball mitt
from a sporting goods store.
I got caught,
and the owner
wanted to call the cops,
teach me a lesson.
But my mom came down there
and, uh,
got him to agree
to let me work off
the cost of the mitt
by sweeping his floor.
And when my sister
crashed the family car,
my dad wanted
to kick her out of the house.
But my mom talked to him,
worked it out
where Christie could work off
the repairs
by cleaning dad's office.
What I'm trying to say is that
my mom understood punishment,
but she also
understood forgiveness.
She did a horrible thing
that she regrets terribly,
and she's paid the price
with 15 years
of her life.
But now it's time
for forgiveness,
from all of us.
We lost both our father
and our mother that day.
So, uh...
So what's changed?
Well, I have.
I forgive her now.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Casey.
Thank you.
Would anyone else
like to speak,
either for
or in opposition to
Ms. Casey's possible parole?
All right, then,
Ms. Casey.
We'll start with
a simple question.
Do you feel remorse
for your crime?
Yes.
Yes. Yes, I do...
Every day.
Hey, there, fellas.
I'm Brian Zvonecek.
I'm relieving here
for the next couple shifts.
Hey.
I said hey.
I know what you're doing.
Oh, yeah?
What am I doing?
You're not pissed at me
because I didn't tell you first.
You're pissed off because
you don't want me to go.
Clarice is moving in.
She's gonna need your key.
This guy,
he has a heart attack
coming down the stairs.
I mean, his heart stops
and everything.
- I think heard about that.
- Yeah, yeah.
And we had to put
the paddles on him and...
he pops
right back up,
like, no big deal,
you know?
I mean,
he completed training.
- I think he's over at 94.
-
Gave him the nickname
"Dead Frank."
I know where I heard
that story before.
You're the guy
with the podcast.
We love that podcast.
Herrmann, right?
He put you up to this.
No, nobody did.
Truck 67,
assist the invalid.
- Hey, Brian.
- Yeah?
- Why don't you drive?
- Seriously?
Yeah, I'm getting tired of it.
Been looking for someone
to take over.
It's weird
without Otis here.
Who am I supposed to jag?
Don't look at me.
And Severide's gone too.
I mean, he's as cocky
as they come,
but if you were
lying in the street,
he'd give you the shirt
off his back.
If you're
lying in the street,
why do you need
his shirt?
You know what I mean.
How many times
I gotta tell you to stay out
of the first watch crate,
Mouch?
The tempt me with
these marshmallows, Lieutenant.
What am I supposed to do?
Give me one.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You hear anything?
- Not yet.
It could be a couple days.
Fingers crossed.
Thanks.
Chief, maybe we should
rethink the dog, eh?
Time 51 got one.
Plus, it would really
piss off Mouch.
No way.
Peter Mills,
where is that dog?
Um, I found a home for it.
- You did?
- Thank God.
Truck 81, ambo 61,
engine 51,
That's Ernie's house.
Ernie?
Ernie?
- I'm going up.
- Okay.
Spread out!
Ernie!
Ernie, call out!
Ernie!
Ernie!
Ernie, call out.
Ernie! Ernie!
Ernie!
Ernie?
Can you hear me?
I'll get you
out of here.
Come on.
Stay with me.
I'm gonna
get you out of here, Ernie.
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.
Shay.
Ernie. Ernie.
What is that?
I lied.
Uh, I... I couldn't find
anyone to take her.
And I couldn't bring her
to my place.
Sorry, guys.
Oh! Come here.
Hey.
Do you wanna say hi to Chief?
Hello?
Yeah.
The parole board.
- I know you like my nose.
-
Look at that.
What's that?
Who's that?
Ahh, jeez.
Fine.
What are we gonna
call this mutt?
- Pouch.
- Huh?
Half pooch, half couch.
Peter Mills,
we're gonna need some bacon.
- Right.
- Thank you.
And?
They granted her parole.
Hey, congratulations.
Yeah.
What?
Well, there is one condition.
She has to move into
a stable household.
Meaning with me.
Oh.
Come on!
Come on!
A little boy?
Step back! We got it.
Nice work.
These older houses
are a tight squeeze.
Thanks.
You know, I come from
a family of doctors.
But the first time
I saw a firefighter
jump into a truck
and roar off,
man, I knew I wasn't
going to medical school.
I wanted to drive
a fire truck.
Your parents
okay with that?
Nope, but I am.
Good for you.
Hey, you know,
this spot in our house
is gonna be permanent.
You should put in
for a transfer.
- What, are you serious?
- Hell, yeah.
I've laughed harder this week
than the last two years.
You should see this place
in the summertime.
Girls everywhere,
all wanting a picture
with Chicago's finest.
It's the best house
in the city.
Public defender
is saying battery,
citing you personally
and the department at large.
If they wanna
have that discussion...
You're having it now.
I apprehended a suspect
in an arson and murder case,
a suspect with an A.P.B.
out on him
who the C.P.D. did not
have enough manpower...
Do you wanna go back
and take the cop's test?
Because it's not too late.
- Ah, come on now, Wallace.
- No, no, no.
These are my bugles.
I'm going on furlough.
When I get back,
you can tell me
if I should
put 'em back on again.
Chief, I just wanna
let you...
Not now.
I'm a stupid ass.
I know.
Yup.
And I'm sorry.
I should've...
I should've camped outside
your room
to tell you first.
You're my best friend, Shay.
Next time...
- Hey.
-
No next time,
I swear.
I'm glad you're
getting yourself healthy,
even if it means
I have to let you go.
No one's letting go.
Come on, let's go in.
- I'm cold.
- All right, yeah.
Hey, you know, tasers
are totally against the rules.
Yeah, I know that.
It's page one.
All you.
Surprise!
You...
- Hey.
- Hi.
I'm not sure what
we're gonna do without you.
-
- Cheers.
Hey.
Look, I promise you
that I understand,
you know, this is just
an opportunity
for us to be roommates.
Nothing more...
What was that?
I love you.
I've always loved you.
I love you too.
You sure you wanna do this,
Peter Mills?
I've been waiting
all day, baby.
Wanna sneak out of here?
Your place, ten minutes?
You're on.
Mm...
- Kick flips?
- No, you.
No, you.
I'm telling you, guys,
it wasn't that bad.
Sorry.
Have you seen Kelly?
Yeah, he's over there.
- Or, was...
- Oh.
So it's 15 degrees,
and there was
this homeless guy
that used to hang around
in an alley
behind the house.
And we find him,
and he is frozen solid.
I mean,
he's a block of ice.
So I call the morgue
and I say, "Listen.
We got a frozen dead guy,
and you gotta
come and pick him up."
And they say,
"Well, he can't just be dead.
He's gotta be warm and dead
before we'll come and get him."
So we dragged the homeless guy
across to the apparatus floor,
and we wait for him
to thaw out,
for about ten hours.
Anyway, eventually
he got warm enough
and dead enough
to actually be dead,
so they came and got him.
You still telling
that one?
Well, I'll be damned.
- Guys.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Dad.
- You want something to eat?
- Oh, nah.
I'm good, thanks.
Uh...
I'm leaving the C.F.D.
What happens when
you and this Renee
get tired of each other,
and you find yourself
in some godforsaken country
with nothing to show for it
- but a pension?
- I don't know.
This doesn't look so bad.
Trust me.
You're worried about
partial paralysis?
How about full paralysis?
'Cause that's what this is.
There is no replacing
rescue squad...
But you already know that.
That's why
you came out here,
so I could talk you
out of going.
Look. I know I wasn't
there for you
like I could've been
or should've been,
and I'm three wives
removed from your mother
and I'm in no position
to give you advice.
But you're scared, Kelly.
And you know
why you're scared?
'Cause you're not ready
for this.
Bennie, you ready?
She's counting on me.
I promised her.
She'll get over it.
Disappoint anyone...
Hell, disappoint everyone,
but don't ever
disappoint yourself.
It's good to see you.
You too, pop.
Hey.
What's going on?
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna get the surgery.
Oh, Kelly, come on.
It's... It's just not
worth the risk.
I mean,
we'll do it right.
You'll come with me.
You'll recuperate
in Madr...
You wanna stay.
I should've known.
I was that close
to not even telling you.
And you would've
come with me to Madrid.
And... the sky would've
been the limit for us.
Hey, hey.
What you did might be
the most important thing
anyone's ever done for me.
Thank you.
Well, uh...
I guess now we're even.
Yeah. We're even.
Shonda.
Wallace.
Can I please see Jimmy?
No.
- He's not your son.
- The hell he ain't.
I raised him
from the time he was three.
Never used the word
"stepson."
Not once.
I need to see him.
Hey. Ralphie.
How are you?
I miss you, boy.
Dad.
You ready?
Yeah. I'm ready.
