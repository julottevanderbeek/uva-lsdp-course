We'll get you
in a cell,
but first the boss wants
to cast an eyeball on you.
But he's king screw,
and you'd do well
not to piss him off.
Outside?
Brisk air'll do wonders
for a Johnson.
That's a heck
of a shot, son.
What was the final
body count? 15?
Me, I can barely
hit these cans at 20.
Tell me, how do you
pick one?
When they're all just
little dots in your scope.
A feeling.
has you taking pot shots
at a guard with
a homemade single-shot.
Is that right?
In the leg.
Which, given your skills,
was purposive.
I wanted transfer,
not murder.
Ten years on the rock,
you'd be the first
who'd come willingly.
What made our little island
your favorite destination?
A private cell.
My own private cell.
Mile and a half,
from here
to the shore.
In case you were
getting ideas.
Situate him
in his private cell.
Mr. Cobb...
Any pointers?
Drop your
shoulder.
seven, one, two,
Please, let's just...
Let's just not.
Come on. I won't
shake it, I promise.
- It'll be fun.
- Okay, you promise?
You have to run a register,
do inventory and stock.
It's not all
videogames
and the first crack
at DC's latest.
Got it, doc.
Hey, what's the new gig,
anyway?
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.
Okay.
It's a task force.
Okay.
FBI, mostly,
some police.
But I can't talk about it.
I'm a civilian authority.
Sounds cool.
Oh, it's cool,
all right.
It's super-cool.
Oh, hot chick.
Don't look,
don't look,
don't look.
You looked.
That's my partner,
from the task force.
No way.
Way.
Go stock something.
You want?
No, thanks.
There's scary stuff in Dim Sum.
Sucks for you.
So...
Read your book
last night.
"Tommy Mansen,"
my grandfather,
A couple typos
in there, but, uh...
What?
Kidding.
Where's the rest?
Rest of what?
There's like six paragraphs
for the other inmates,
and only one paragraph
for Tommy.
It's all
I could find.
Did he really
kill your partner?
Yeah, we were
chasing after him
and didn't even
know it.
Weird.
Chasing your own grandfather.
One, two,
three, four.
One, two, three, four.
There's 47 slats
in the picket fence.
Four, seven, one,
two, three, four,
one, two...
Two, three, four,
- No!
Hey, Hopper.
How's the new gig
with the feds?
Oh, you know.
So what's
going on?
Some kind
of sniper.
SWAT's searching
everything at 750 yards.
Area's
on lockdown.
Who's
the ride-along?
He's a famous
comic book writer.
The victims, are they,
you know, still here?
Look, homicides
are never easy.
Well, before I met you,
it wasn't really an issue.
I'm just saying.
You have to detach yourself
from everything you see.
Don't let your emotions
cloud your judgment.
Okay?
Who've we got?
You tell me.
Ernest Cobb.
Gotta be.
Wichita sniper.
He learned to shoot
killing crows
for farmers.
It's how
he made a living
after he left
the orphanage.
All the kill shots
were to the heart.
Oh, boy. He does three
shootings in three days,
then he goes
underground.
So we've got
two teenagers
Doc?
Doc?
How's the new partner
working out?
Hey, doc.
Take long,
deep breaths.
Cobb's shootings
were always random.
No M.O., as far as his
victims were concerned.
Random.
That just means
we don't have
enough information yet.
Or aren't sharing it.
Maybe I'm not
cut out for this.
You know what kind
of rifle Cobb used,
back in the day?
It's Winchester,
model 70, I think.
No. No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uses the same bullets
as an M-40.
So the S.F.P.D.
is assuming
that he's using
a modern weapon,
but Cobb's maximum range
with a Winchester
is what?
Probably 500 yards?
Not 750.
So the buildings they're
searching are too far away.
Nice work.
Guy on the midway...
Boom.
Bam bam.
Casings should have
popped this way.
I don't know,
Rebecca.
He would've
cleaned up afterward.
The guy was
kind of O.C.D.
Okay.
What?
Another killer
back from the Rock?
We've got two days
to catch him.
On March 21st, 1963,
Alcatraz
officially closed.
All the prisoners were
transferred off the island.
Only that's not
what happened.
Not at all.

Inmates on the tier!
Hey, buddy!
I see you.
I know you're in there.
You can't hide,
buddy.
Leave me alone.
Mail call today.
who I bet a Lincoln is trying
to poke her in the laundry room.
Anyways, they're
asking for rent,
which request
the missus passes to me.
Even from a distance
she is a piece of work.
These damn chicks.
I gotta...
Name's Jack Sylvane.
Where does he go?
Do you know him?
No.
He's back.
Just like
you're back.
Why?
Are you working together?
Where have you been, Jack,
for the past 50 years?
Who's watching me?
I don't know.
and then I...
And then I wasn't.
When you
were captured,
they found this
in your pocket.
Do you know
what it opens?
Did someone
ask you to get it?
I...don't...know.
He's telling
the truth.
I found Cobb's
storage box.
This isn't the only door
without a handle, you know?
There's another one
in the file room.
And there are three buttons
in the elevator
that you can't press
without a key.
He's got
a whole operation,
and we're only
a tiny part of it.
Now you're the main part
of our part,
so what does he
need me for?
- I'm just...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hauser's people?
No.
We did.
Cobb spent more time
in solitary confinement
than any other
inmate on record.
Any issues with authority or
had trouble following the rules?
How'd they catch him
the last time?
Someone recognized him from
the FBI's most wanted list.
Yeah, I don't
think we can
put a time-traveling
sniper's face
on the most wanted
list.
Yeah,
probably not.
The hammer markings
on the casing you found
For Cobb's
gun of choice.
get a ballistics report
in two hours?
Does this lead
to something concrete?
Old rifle.
He would've had to get it
at a specialty gun shop.
Then why are you
still here?
You wanted children.
Go babysit.
You know, Emerson,
they're not so bad.
Tell me Hauser isn't
the nutcase I think he is.
He's a little prickly
sometimes,
but he's
all right.
You've been
with him a while?
With him,
without him.
Whoa,
in 3D.
Think I got a second amendment
contact high.
Hello,
Whitten.
Detective Madsen.
What an unspeakable
pleasure.
You know, I thought the ATF
took your license away.
All my wife's licenses
are up-to-date.
Thank you, ma'am.
I just work here.
Never seen him.
Sorry.
Oh, wow.
That's a relief.
'Cause this guy's a suspect
in this morning's shooting,
so whoever sold him the gun
is gonna be in a world of hurt.
Glad it's not you.
You know what?
This individual did,
in fact,
come to the store
a couple of days ago.
Picked up
an old Winchester.
Model 70.
Prepaid credit card.
No name or address.
You know that
without looking?
Do you know
how many 70s I've sold
in the past ten years?
One.
You know the drill.
Security footage,
please.
Ooh, pause it there.
Yeah, not
that many hotels
still use that kind of
room marker any more.
-  Oh, yes,
I'm the great pretender
-  ooh ooh ooh
-  pretending
that I'm doing well
-  ooh ooh ooh
-  my need is such
Give us
some space.
-  I pretend too much
I'm lonely,
but no one can tell...
First prison where
I eat the same as you.
Full bellies make a man
less likely to cause upset.
You eat alone.
What was that, son?
You need to speak up.
Alone.
You eat alone.
Oh.
"Honorable warden
Edwin James,
"I respectfully and kindly
request a transfer
"to deep lock
in a solitary cell,
"the purpose of which is
for me to take meals in private
"and abstain from
communal visits to the yard.
"Also, I would prefer
to be in a cell block
where talking and
fraternization was prohibited."
Really beautiful
letter, son.
Request denied.
No.
- No?
- No.
This ain't a hotel, son.
You don't get to
pick your accommodations.
A new cell,
a quiet cell...
I'm gonna pick up
this bone now
and chew on it.
I'd prefer to
do that in private.
Please. No!
- So we sign in here?
- Mm-hmm.
Great, may I?
Can I ask you
something?
Do you know how
these guys are coming back,
and who's... you know...
behind it?
'Cause I have some theories
involving wormholes,
but how is it
you seem to just
accept everything
that's happening,
like it's not
the biggest thing
ever?
How I feel
about what's happening
doesn't change the fact
that it is happening.
Thanks.
That helps a ton.
This is the place.
Manager I.D.'d Cobb.
Room 123.
I've called Hauser.
He'll be here momentarily.
No, no, no.
We can't risk Cobb
slipping away.
Stay behind until
I say it's clear.
Police!
Clear!
There's 47 slats
in the picket fence.
Four, seven.
One, two.
Lucy, get down!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Doc, get out of here!
Call an ambulance!
Come on!
Go!
Stay with me, Lucy.
Stay with me, okay?
The blood pressure's
dropping.
Where are you
taking her?
St. Mary's.
What happened?
She was at the window.
He must have been
sitting on the room,
watching,
waiting for us.
Whose fault is that?
He played us,
like he knew
we were coming.
Do these guys know
we're chasing them?
What does
that matter?
Look, if I knew
how they got here
or what they want,
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.
Stop...talking!
This is
what I know,
that Cobb is
still out there,
he will continue to kill,
and that is all
you need to know.
She's alive.
But she's in a coma.
Doctor says
it might be temporary,
but it also might be
not so temporary.
Hello, Jack.
Was she a target?
I don't know.
Was she a target?
Answer me.
I don't know.
That's a shame.
Maybe Dr. Beauregard
can jog your memory.
This is weird.
And awful.
The only thing we can do
to help Lucy now
is to find Cobb, Okay?
Okay.
What's that?
Lucy must have set up
a database on the '63s.
Those are
the first five victims.
Hauser said Cobb
didn't have an M.O.,
that his shootings
were random.
Yeah.
What if he used
the randomness
to hide
his real victim?
And who was that?
There's always
a girl.
She's about 15,
but she's in every shooting,
just like the carnival.
Who's the 16-year-old
in his life?
I don't know.
He grew up in an orphanage.
He ran away when he was 12.
Found her
when he was 20,
but she slammed
the door in his face.
And she would have been
in her 40s, not 16.
What are
you doing?
Cobb's been ahead of us
the whole time,
and I'm trying to get
ahead of him.
Found a box
in the file room
filled with letters
that were never delivered.
This one's for Cobb.
Why didn't he
get it?
Well, when you're an inmate
and you want to get letters,
you have to give the warden
a list of names.
From Eloise Monroe.
"Dear Ernest, you probably
don't remember me,
"but I was there the day
you came to find your mom,
"who's my mom, too.
"Which, I guess, means
we're brother and sister.
"I'm sorry she was
unkind to you.
"She's never been one
for surprises.
Sincerely, Eloise."
So Cobb didn't even know
she tried to contact him.
Nope.
Looks like
you were right.
What do you mean?
So I'm Cobb, and
I finally find my mom,
I get up the courage
to go see her,
she slams the door
in my face.
not much younger than me,
a 16-year-old girl.
And this one she actually
took the trouble to raise.
Why her and not me?
If I'm Cobb, I'm pissed.
Is Eloise
still alive?
No, I checked.
Died in a car accident
nine years ago.
Well, we know the why.
Let's find the where.
I'll keep digging.
Pier "C".
Bring in outside "B."
On your feet.
Open 114.
There's 47 slats
in the picket fence...
One more time.
Get up.
Oh!
Oh!
Welcome to solitary.
Your days of elbow-rubbing
and hobnobbing are over.
No mess hall,
no work detail,
no talking.
Open 212!
Okay.
Yeah.
What's that?
Son of a bitch
made himself a scope.
Does it work?
Yeah,
it works.
He just sat here,
staring at the city...
At people...
waiting.
For what?
The day he could
kill them. Come on.
Good morning.
I gotta
hand it to you.
You could have
done anything,
jumped a guard,
fire-bombed your cell,
heck, you could have
took a page
from your own playbook
and made yourself a gun.
But you showed
real smarts.
Studied
that rule book
till you found
the perfect infraction.
"Number 28,
daily routine.
"Stand by your cell door,
facing out.
Remain there till the bell
signal sounds again."
Simple.
Elegant.
You committed
the smallest breach
in the most public of ways,
and you forced my hand.
You win, son,
fair and square.
There's just one thing.
Open up!
I believe you two fellas
know each other.
Oh, wait.
Wait.
Y-you can't.
no... you can't!
Son,
this is my prison.
I can do whatever
the hell I like.
No. No, no, no,
no, no, you can't!
Well, that man
makes me nervous.
You must have done something
real bad, shut... shut...
Because this right here is the
worst cell in the place. Shut...
I believe you.
I gotta say...
I know, I know,
I know...
I mean, that view right there,
that view of the city,
I mean,
that is unbelievable,
- because we're looking...
- Stop it!
- At people right there...
- Stop it!
- No, no, no...
- All the people run around,
and all we can do is sit
and watch it and think about
all the things that we're
not having right now...
Stop. Stop.
Shut... shut your mouth!
- Shut up!
- That's... I mean, that's torture
it is,
it's torture.
Shut it!
No!
For the trumpet will sound!
And the dead
shall be raised imperishable!
And we will all
be changed...
It's his third shooting.
- We missed him.
- No.
Lucy wasn't part
of his pattern,
it's number two.
We've got one more shot.
The view narrows our
search to three miles
Both of the shootings
happened
at the highest vantage
point in that area.
Can you remove
the structures
that weren't there
in '63,
the ones Cobb wouldn't have
seen from his cell?
Uh, let me see.
Okay, got it.
and these are the buildings
that Cobb could see in 1963.
How's Lucy?
She's stable.
But the doctors say
there's no telling
the extent of the damage.
What do you got?
This is what Cobb saw
from his cell every day.
Just imagined it
over and over.
And these are
the buildings
Yeah, from the rooftops
he could shoot down
That's where
we're gonna find him.
Let's take a ride.
I got this one.
Alive,
I want him alive.
in the picket fence.
Picket fence.
There's 47 slats
in the picket fence...
There's 47 slats
in the picket fence.
One, two, three...
Cobb!
in the picket fence.
Drop your weapon!
Three, four, five...
I know you met
your mother!
You saw your sister.
Her name was Eloise.
- Go to hell.
- She wanted to know you.
She wanted
a big brother.
Go to hell!
Okay, Cobb,
I'm coming out.
Here's the gun.
All right?
My hands are
in the air.
I have the letter.
I can show you.
Your sister's
not out there.
- Shut...
- Cobb!
Don't move!
-Don't move!
- Oh.
Is he right-handed?
Yeah.
No more shooting.
I don't think
I can hack this.
- Doc...
- No, I mean it.
I mean, Hauser
doesn't need me,
and what we're doing,
stone-cold killers
and dead bodies,
and someone I actually
know getting...
Right in front of me.
This isn't a comic book
world, is it?
I mean, real people
are gonna die
if we don't
catch these guys.
It's okay
to feel this way, doc.
It comes
with the job.
I'm afraid...
I'm not gonna be
good at it.
Well, too late.
You already are.
I want to you go home,
get some sleep,
and get ready
for the next one,
because I need you.
Thanks.
Close it up.
I could have
killed you today.
But now you're here,
you're gonna wish I had.
I hate to see
it's come to this,
trussed up like
a Christmas hog,
But not to worry, son.
I've studied
and researched
and found a doctor who,
with God's will,
might could be able
to help you.
If anyone can figure
what's gone amiss
in that noggin of yours,
it's this little lady here.
Welcome to Alcatraz,
Dr. Sengupta.
Thank you,
warden James.
Hello, Mr. Cobb.
My name is
Lucille Sengupta.
I'm here to help you.
