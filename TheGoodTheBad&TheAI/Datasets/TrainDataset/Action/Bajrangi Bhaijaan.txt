why he penetrate here.
bajrangi is a normal guy
like us and his motive was.
love for a speakless pakistani
who lost in india with her parents
he's not picking up..

and his name is bajrangi
like police i thought he's spy,
but i know hes not

what he wants.
his only motive was love.
for a speakless pakistani girl
who lost in india..
bajrangi has only this
way to send her back
to this story..every
channel denied to show
nobody is interested in it.
so help bajrangi so he can
go back to his home
if you know this girl so..
what this press, media is thinking
he's indian spy for us
that girl's parents called us and
said that she lost in india.
but pakistani people has
sympathy for him
i want pawan's confession anyhow.
i worked all my life for
protecting this country
if this guy..
goes in the pakistani jail
so it will be against the
honor of our country
get the camera..
look bajrangi is on t.v
today the pakistani press officer
posted new video today
who is locked in pakistani jail
pawan chatravedi.
aka. bajrangi bhaijan.
who putted his life in danger
for a lost pakistani girl.
why he did ?
for money, fame?
no..
he did it with his clear heart.
he see her with love.
not enemy
but alas..
this god's man stuck in two country hate
and today the hate forced
him to hide like criminal
and we've to do this..
the people.
who wants to treat their kids with love.
lets finish this hae.
move forward to narowar

but this time not beneath the wires.
open the door..
i've your arrest order
if putting his life in danger
he brought back lost girl

if they can find true or false,
why not you?
so this guy should be
stopped crossing border.
but we are few soldiers..
and people are in mob
