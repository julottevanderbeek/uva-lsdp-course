- What time is it, sweetheart?
- It's okay, go back to sleep.
I know, but I told you to wake me up.
You need to take some rests,
it's for both of you.
I love you.
I love you too.
Wait for Daddy home, all right?
I'll bring him home.
THE RAID : REDEMPTION
OK, listen guys!
Our target is Tama Riyadi.
I'm sure all of you here know who he is.
All the bad guys in this city
consider him as a legend in dark world,
as a drug supplier, a murderer, a robber.
Even a thug-wannabe thought so.
During the last 10 years his building
became a free-cops zone.
I don't care who support him,
and how big-influence he is,
Because now he dares to make his
apartment rooms for rent,
As hiding place for the criminals that we hunt.
Our mission is simple ...
We enter,  take and drag him out!
- Yes sir!
- Tama is not alone.
Intelligence reports, there is
a big narcotics lab in there,
And a mass of people who ready to
do anything to protect that place.
He  has two trusted servant.
The first one called Mad Dog.
A "mad dog" that he dragged from the street,
that would do anything and die for him.
Second one is named Andi.
The brain of Tama's business.
And he's the only one who can hold
Mad Dog's tail.
Meanwhile, be cautious for these two people.
If you were careless,
you guys got slaughtered by them.
Hey, no need for shaking, all right?
Be patient.
Where were we at?
Focus is necessary.
Secure the place floor by floor.
Everyone concentrate on
each gun-point.
Why us? Why today?
- Why the hell not?
- That's a valid question!
That's as valid as my answer!
Are we finished?
Should I continue? Yeah? hmm?
You need to know, that this is not
the first time that place is under attack.
For many times, Tama's rivals tried
to overtake the place.
But always failed.
Be advice! These people are well-trained,
and well-prepared for war.
Re-check the weapons!
I don't want any empty seat when
we back home.
Let's go! We clean this city's mess!
- Morning, Sir!
- Morning.
- Who are they?
- They're new members.
My responsibility. I guarantee.
They won't disturb.
But you don't forget with our mission, right?
Lieutenant, to cover area that wide,
you should've known, we need more guys.
Also as wide as the possibilty for mistakes.
They're beginners.
This is not a training camp!
Okay. I put them behind.
Behind? The most behind!
Split the group into two.
I'll enter from main door. Find alternative path.
We meet at the gate. Okay?
- And Wahyu, you're with me.
- Yes, Sir.
Go!
We have commitment, all right? Always
train and perform the best shows..
Take him down.
B3 clear.
Let's go! Upstairs now!
Silence! Don't move!
What the hell?!
I gotta go upstairs.
Even you go to fucking sea, I don't care!
My wife is alone up there. She needs this medicine.
I gotta go upstairs!
Damn!
Step once more, that's gonna be your last!
What the hell?!
That's enough.
Bowo, enough!
Wanna be a hero?
Go ahead.
Don't step any closer!
- What room are you, Sir?
- 726
Relax. I'll take you to your room.
You need to be relax. Until this area is secured.
How about my wife up there, then?
I understand. But you need to remain calm.
Bullshit!
Listen, you only have 2 options.
With me, or with him.
Okay, everyone! We enter now!
You, keep an eye on him!
Huh?
Stop him!
Clear!
Tie him!
Fuck!
Don't move!
Don't be stupid, boy!
Stay where you at!!
Good.
Now ...
Wait!
Police!
- Is that fucking necessary?!
- It is!
Sergeant, we got another one!
Fuck!!
Police!
Problem?
They're here.
Shut all communications down.
Lock all access down!
I wanna ask neighbors to play.
We have visitors. You know what to do.
I'll take the one on the left,
You'll take the one on the right.
Now ...
Hold on! Let him scream.
Outside is secured.
Jono!
This is a football news. Last night. What a game.
I'm a true football fans.
So all games, I..
Help! They wanna kill me!
- Stop, don't move!
- Help! They wanna kill me!
Don't move!
Fifth floor is secured.
Let's go get them! Focus!
- We stay in one formation! Be more cautious!
- All right / Okay!
- Lieutenant, you come with me! / Yep!
Rama leave him. Return to formation!
Deer 1, Deer 1. This is Jaka.
Come in.
To anyone who's listening to this.
This is Sergeant Jaka. Come in.
They're dead.
Good morning, pals!
Maybe you've heard, we got uninvited guests.
It is not me who invite them.
And surely they are not welcomed here.
For the sake of our business..
You may give your help to disinfenct
these fleas.
Then you have your reward to stay for free.
You may meet these uninvited guests
at sixth floor.
Have a nice work!
And don't forget to have fun.
Lieutenant, we need backup now.
- We still can handle this.
- With all due respect, Lieutenant.
These bastards are gonna burn us alive,
if we don't do anything.
- We need backup now! / Impossible!
- What the heck with "impossible"?!
This raid is not..
Who the hell knows we're here?!
What on earth have you done, Lieutenant?
We're alone.
Sergeant!
Stay here.
Go forward.
Now!
Everyone back off!
Move!
- What the fuck have you done, huh?
- Come here!
See that.
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Watch your mouth!
This is my business, I'll take care of it.
Use your brain!
What if they got their backup, huh?
You can't shoot the cops, you buy them!
Done!
You think they come here asking for money?
There won't be any backups.
There won't be any evidences.
There's no any diffrence with last takeover.
No shit! We take them all down.
- Are you sure?
- I've known the culprit.
Damn this old motherfucker!
How dare he enters my kingdom.
Back off! Everybody back off!
Hangi, break the door!
Clear!
Guard the door!
Don't!
Fuck!
Leave this place now!
Ari, the axe!
Sergeant!
Come on!
Jaka!
Wait!
They have come.
Get me the fuck out of here!
Alee, help!
Dagu!
Get it forward, open fast.
One, two, three.
What the fuck is this?
It's a news flash for who we're dealing with.
How bad?
Localized. Only two rooms.
Not bad.
And about 30 people who rent for us,
die into pieces.
Check the rooms where they stay.
Take their stashes.
All paid.
Get down. Bring your guys.
Clear this shit.
Yes, boss.
You take the stairs, I get the elevator.
We meet on the seventh floor.
Tomi, Angga, go with him.
No need.
I go along.
I go along.
Fine.
Okay, come on.
- Where are we going?
- That man before, he was here.
- No, no.
- Relax! We can't out like this.
- Don't you ever leave me there.
- He is not one of them.
That son of a bitch must've torn me apart.
I would haunt you.
Whatever.
Come on!
Up. 2 floors.
Please, open the door!
Please, open the door! We're wounded.
If not, we'll die.
Don't open! Don't open!
They're closer.
For the sake of God, look at my face.
Please open the door. Please.
Start from there.
Over here.
Keep going.
Wait.
Hey, what's going on?
Shut the fuck up!
You wanna die now?
Check all cupboards, bathroom.
Don't leave anything unswept.
- Hey, what are you hiding?
- Nothing.
Don't you dare lie to me, okay?
I have no time for your lie.
All of you make me fed up!
When I fed up, I off-control.
- For the sake of Allah, I'm not lying.
- we'll see.
What is this?
You are all bastards! Bastards!
You are all bastards!
Go to hell! You're all go to hell!
- Hey, can you shut your damn mouth up, huh?
- Nothing's here. You just destroy all of these!
Don't even try lying to me, okay?!
What should I lie for?
You want me to slice that bitch up, huh?
You want it, huh? Sit down!
OK, let's go.
Quick, get a knife or anything sharp.
Quick!
Okay, pretty bad.
I need you to calm down.
I can do it. Don't worry.
Only this.
Get the right one, shit!
I only got this. Or do you need spoon?
Or chop sticks?
Just do it, quick.
What's wrong?
What the hell?!
You must tell me everything about
this place, Sir.
Anything that can be used to help
me get him out of here.
I wish I could.
Tama gets this place under heavy surveillance.
Even if there was a place out of camera angel,
You'd still trapped in here.
There's no way for escape.
There's no way out. The only one is
your entrance,
with full force.
You must be careful. You're not here
on the humanity mission.
Don't be blind. I've seen your boss before.
He knows this building as well as I and others do.
Not every cop can be paid, Sir.
If I didn't believe you,
I wouldn't open the door.
He is stubborn. I don't get him.
But he's a good man.
Take care of him,
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Hey, you're too sadistic!
Hey, that's him!
Upstairs!
His legs!
Where did this man come from?
Stop! Calm down! Calm down!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Stay here.
They're all dead.
We don't know that for sure.
Think about it Jaka, one's a cripple,
the other one is a rookie.
They can't survive.
I don't wanna sacrifice myself,
only for saving their lives.
Listen to me, motherfucker.
When it comes to the lives of my men,
It's better for you to shut the fuck up.
You talk about sacrifice?
That's exactly what they're doing now.
Your life is on my hand.
- Who order this raid?
- What?!
Surely it's not you.
Nobody wants to bath their hands
with dirty work, nobody.
Remember, Jaka.
- What is your rank?
- Rank?
What the hell with rank!
After we get out of here..
You're gonna mop the pee on prison floor,
for the rest of your life.
We're here not on humanity mission.
We're here on behalf of someone's business.
Now, who's the culprit beyond all of these?
This is not the right time.
This is not the right place.
Whatever.
We're gonna back up there.
We're gonna find our men who survived.
And then we go out of here.
Any objections?
L.i.l.i.y.a.n.a  4  k.u.c.i.n.g._.g.a.u.l
Everyone get ready.
Go.
Protect him! Now!!
Actually, it is not enough.
There's no fun.
Just pull the trigger, you end.
And this ...
This is cool.
This is fun.
This game, is exactly what I like.
You shouldn't be here, Rama.
Nor should you.
Who are they?
No one.
Don't you think they have any data, that we..
They don't have any evidence.
Only our first name.
Nobody knows anything about us.
I almost choked when they place
your photo on the board.
Six years without any contact,
and now you come from the middle of nowhere.
You have to leave this place.
- Now.
- I can't.
- Not without my friend.
- what? / You heard me.
But you do understand the situation, aren't you?
I do. I'm not the one who lives here.
You're gonna be fine, Rama. Please save your
time if you wanna go here. Just call me.
Oh yeah?
All day I heard my friends..
talk about to cut your head off!
I can help to get you out of here.
Without get you handcuffed in front of my friends.
What the hell?!
You wanna save me?!
Last time I checked, my friends here are almost done.
But, look at your friends...
- Just fucking do what I ask for!
- And then what? Home?
I am a big disappointment for him.
And I'm sure he would be very proud of
who I am now.
Dad just wants you to go home.
We want you to go home.
You don't get it, Rama.
I am who you're looking at right now,
is not who I was.
Just because you see what I do is wrong,
does not mean I can not be good at it, Rama.
I paid for my place here.
I am respected here.
No, Rama.
I will not go back into what I was.
You're going to be an uncle.
What?
Yes, a boy, due in two months.
You tell me this because...
Are you expecting me to leave ....?
- I told you this, because you're my brother!
- Think about what you are doing!
If you choose to stay here, huh?
You sacrifice your life.
- Soon, you'll be a daddy.
- I think about that.
Every goddamn day since I got this assignment.
And that fucking terrifies me!
This is fucking ridiculous! Smart-ass!
You must go, I don't have much time.
At least change your clothing before
you leave.
No, this suits me.
I go first. After the situation is good,
You can go.
Wait! Hold the door.
- Where are your men?
- Still hunting. And yours?
The same.
- Where are you taking him?
- To the Boss.
That's not the guy.
- It is.
- No, definitely isn't.
Plus this guy is already dead.
Well, I'm taking him anyway.
What do you get?
Rama. Get in.
- Where is Bowo?
- He is safe.
We lost the Sergeant. They got him. Die.
That motherfucker dragged him
across the floor like an animal.
What happened? Why did you got split up?
We have fallen in the ambush.
They got in.
And he ran.
Sergeant ordered me to protect him.
Now we can only
try to survive this.
We must get out of here, quick.
You are the cause of every drop of blood
spilled in this place.
But now, you don't have any choice.
You must follow us on every step.
Whatever it takes,
until this nightmare is over.
- What then?
- we go upstairs. Attack.
We pull out the target, and use him as our
way out of here.
- Finding him won't be easy.
- 15th floor.
It's where they control everything.
But it is hard to get there.
And assuming we do get there...
What will you do? Huh? What?
- We force him.
- How?
Man like him should be kneeled.
- By what?
- A knife, a chair leg, bare hands, anything.
Do whatever needs to be done to
make him ours.
We still have time to get out.
- What is this?
- I told you, that is not the guy.
Yeah. He wears uniform,
and importantly I got something. You?
Isn't it right, Andi?
What do you mean?
Usually you come bringing something.
You're the only one who don't waste my time.
What can I say? I got nothing.
Let me see your hands.
- Come here. / What?
- Come here.
Empty.
You must keep something.
Flip them.
I was wrong.
You did waste my fucking time.
- I saw a lot of dead bodies, downstairs.
- Oh yeah? Then?
I think only 20 cops left downstairs.
I think it is 3. What do you think?
Approximately so.
Too many floors to be covered.
Approximately?
Listen up, asshole!
I admit you have a gut. I salute it for you.
But never underestimate my business.
You see that?
After seeing that, I never get my eyes
off the screen.
Looks like only this monitor that
I can trust, asshole!
Only this thing that lets me know everything.
I wanted to ask you..
Why?
You did such a bold move ...
Usually it's not because of the clash of conscience.
Must be something more.
But then I think, "it's useless..".
You're gonna die here anyway.
Why should I ask you "where were you just now?"
But I wanna know..
Who is that dog that bring hurricane
to my kingdom?
And I wanna know his reactions..
If I slaughtered you in front of him..
Or, if I slaughtered him in front of you..
Fuck you!
Come on!
Don't move!
Drop your gun!
Why does everything gotta be like this, now?
Get over here!
Quick!
What's wrong, officer?
Shut the fuck up! Raise your hands!
Dagu, tie him!
Now, get me outta here!
Amazing.
What the hell are you doing? Dagu!
He didn't make it.
Fuck you, motherfucker! Why?!
Let it go. This will be over soon.
Soon everything is gonna be fine.
- You can not leave this place!
- Shut up!
Did you think it was easy to sneak around here,
without getting busted?
Did you think I'm that stupid?
I was waiting for you intentionally.
Everyone was.
So, we can get you.
Unfortunately, you didn't make it.
Don't be so sure. Eighteen of your men
are now dead bodies.
Plus your car.
You'd be better to give up.
You only have a few men left.
Mine outnumbers yours, boss.
I only need a single bullet
to blow your skull up!
You don't get it, do you?
You're already dead.
You're dead after Reza called me.
What's wrong?
You're shocked? hearing his name? yeah?
Reza and his fancy friends never say "no" to me.
I know what I have to pay,
and how much..
Meanwhile, you can get some discounts from me.
This is not about killing me.
But you were sent here to die, screw you!
- Motherfucker, fuck you!
- Fuck you!
Listen to me! You won't count.
Never!
You can only look above..
Did you think when all of these are over,
you'll got a badge?
Be a hero?!
No, you son of a bitch!
You'll haunted by bullets..
You won't get a wink of sleep,
You got suffocate on your own pillow!
Your career is over.
Just a matter of time.
Fuck you!
Shut up.
He actually have known that someone
will dethrone him someday.
Here is the evidence.
It will show you who are in the black list.
Not everyone you know is bad, Rama.
Give it to Bunawar.
He is a good man.
Open the gate!
Keep walking.
Follow me.
I'm sure I can save your life
in this world..
To protect you..
But can you save me out there?
The cops are gonna be here.
They will destroy this place.
We'll be gone before they get here.
Then why do you stay?
For the same reason why
you stayed in that uniform.
Because it fits.
