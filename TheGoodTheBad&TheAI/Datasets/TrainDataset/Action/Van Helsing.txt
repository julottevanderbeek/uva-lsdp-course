Thousands.
Thousands more.
VAN HELSING: No.
ANNA: You heard what he said.
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.
I can sense evil.
VAN HELSING: This thing, man,
whatever it is...
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.
But evil does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.
- I can.
- Not while I'm here.
Anna.
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.
Oh, my God. He's seen us.
Now they'll come for him.
Neither you nor I
will be able to stop them.
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.
And then the painting came alive...
and the two creatures
attacked each other.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.
I'm staring at him.
Is that a man?
VAN HELSING: Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!
Me and all of humanity!
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.
Not even a werewolf.
Anything else, you're on your own.
- Let me go.
- Where are you going to go?
I don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!
Save him! Save the monster!
VERONA: Stakes!
No!
CARL: Oh, my God.
I can help!
You won't kill me?
Only if you don't hurry!
Jump!
Velkan.
Velkan.
Anna...
forgive me.
I will see you again.
ANNA: You killed him.
Now you know
why they call me murderer.
Oh, my God.
You've been bitten.
Anna!
Anna.
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.
What do you want?
ALEERA: The master commands a trade.
The monster for the Princess.
Somewhere public. Lots of people.
A place where your master
will be less inclined...
to expose his other side.
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.
- Are you all right?
- No.
He has been bitten.
FRANKENSTEIN: Bitten by a werewolf.
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.
I am sorry.
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.
VAN HELSING: Well,
they won't find him in here.
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.
VAN HELSING: God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?
VAN HELSING: Carl, help me!
CARL: Right.
CARL: How many commandments
can we break in one day?
CARL: Anyway, according to the book...
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.
CARL: That's two nights from now.
CARL: You'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you...
until the final stroke of midnight.
VAN HELSING: So I have nothing
to worry about.
CARL: My God, you should be terrified.
VAN HELSING: Thanks.
CARL: Sorry.
CARL: We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.
You sure he can't get out of there?
VAN HELSING: Not without
some help from the dead.
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?
I won't let you trade me, Count.
I have no intention of trading you.
DRACULA: And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do...
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.
There they are.
You make my skin crawl.
This is not all I could do
with your skin.
Carl, I need you to do something.
I'm not gonna like this, am I?
DRACULA: Don't we make a lovely couple?
Oh, my God.
DRACULA: I am looking
for a new bride, Anna.
Someone strong and beautiful.
One brief moment of pain...
and we can be together forever.
You have no heartbeat.
DRACULA: Perhaps it just needs...
to be rekindled.
Anna. Anna!
VAN HELSING: Wake up.
DRACULA: Gabriel.
Oh, Gabriel.
Welcome to my summer palace.
Master! Look, master!
We have him, master.
We have him!
You wretched undead...
I shall have my revenge!
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...
"I shall fear no evil."
Now that everything
is as it should be...
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...
Van Helsing!
Come on.
Yes!
Now I know what it's for.
- Where are we going?
- Through that window!
Carl, you're a genius!
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.
Say goodbye to your friends.
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!
I swear to God!
- I must save him.
- No, you can't.
Why?
I cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.
What did they say?
CARL: Even if you kill Dracula...
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.
He isn't evil.
But they say he isn't human, either.
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.
What of me? Did you tell them
what I'm to become?
VAN HELSING: Did they tell you
how to kill me?
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?
ANNA: Stop!
CARL: No, I left you out!
I'm sorry.
It's starting.
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.
Wherever that is.
Look, there's still time.
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.
The sun sets in two hours.
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!
Yes, well, I wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was I?
VAN HELSING: Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.
The son of your ancestor.
Everybody knows that. What else?
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.
VAN HELSING: Do you know
who murdered him?
CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.
And in 1462, when Dracula died...
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?
BOTH: Sorry.
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.
He was to kill Dracula...
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...
right down the line
all the way to you.
ANNA: But he couldn't do it.
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.
- All right, so where is this door?
- I don't know.
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.
So that future generations
might do it for him.
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.
Clues to the door's location.
The door.
Of course.
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.
I think you were right.
Quite literally.
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.
Look. A Latin inscription.
CARL: Maybe it works
like the painting in the tower.
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.
- Your father didn't have this.
- Where did you get that?
VAN HELSING: Carl, finish it.
In the name of God, open this door.
A mirror.
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.
But why?
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.
It's cold. And it's snowing.
VAN HELSING: See you on the other side.
Be careful.
Castle Dracula.
CARL: Do we have a plan?
CARL: Doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo...
but some sort of plan would be nice.
VAN HELSING: We're going to stop Dracula.
ANNA: And kill anything
in our way.
CARL: Well, you let me know how that goes.
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold...
that doesn't seem like a good thing.
We'd better get moving.
CARL: So are all of those...
ANNA: Yes.
- And inside them are...
- Yes.
Igor do this! Lgor do that!
How did you find...
It's impossible!
- Please don't kill me!
- Why not?
Well, I...
My master has awakened.
- There is a cure.
- What?
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!
ANNA: Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?
- I don't care!
- I do.
Why does he need one? Why?
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.
The painting. That's what it meant.
ANNA: Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.
You're going to take these two...
- and lead them to the antidote.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...
you'll be able to kill Dracula.
We just need to find the cure...
and get it into you
before the final stroke.
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?
If they even suspect you
of misleading them...
clip off one of his fingers.
- I'll clip off something.
- The tower over there...
- that's where it is.
- And what about the other tower?
- Give me that!
- That is where...
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would I lie to you?
Not if you wanted to live.
Now, if I'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight...
- I don't think I could.
- You must.
Come on.
I don't like this plan.
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.
You still don't understand.
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.
We must save my family.
If you're late, run like hell.
Don't be late.
Now go. Go.
FRANKENSTEIN: Get off me,
you vermin from hell!
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!
And now you must give that life
to my children.
Up!
There it is.
I'll go first.
Carl!
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get lgor. Igor get you!
- Go ahead. Grab it.
- You go ahead and grab it.
If there's one thing I've learned...
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.
- Did I scare you?
- No.
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?
Get it!
Hot.
- Come on!
- Yes.
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!
You can't go until I say you can go!
Keep running, Carl!
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!
CARL: Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.
Yes. You want one?
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.
I am accustomed to pain.
It lets you know you're alive.
Give me life!
One more bolt
and my young will live.
VAN HELSING: You're almost out, my friend!
Help me!
But you're supposed to die.
I want to live.
All right!
Be happy in the knowledge...
that I shall weep
over your dead body.
Hang on!
I'll swing you loose!
You are too late, my friend.
My children live.
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.
Correct.
So be it.
One.
No, this cannot be.
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!
Now!
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!
Hurry!
ANNA: Throw it to me, Carl!
Yes!
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.
But I escaped. So can you.
ALEERA: Anna, my love...
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.
What do you think of that?
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.
Don't stand there talking about it.
Don't you understand?
We could be friends. Partners!
Brothers-in-arms!
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...
to be the Left Hand of God.
All I want is life, Gabriel.
The continuation of my kind.
And perhaps the return of my ring.
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.
Some things
are better left forgotten.
For God!
God forgive me.
She's dead.
CARL:
