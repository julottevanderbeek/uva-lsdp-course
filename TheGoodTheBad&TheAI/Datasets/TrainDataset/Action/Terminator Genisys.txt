Before they died, my
parents told me stories
What it was like long
before I was born.
a computer program designed
to automate missile defense.
And decided all humanity was
a threat to its existence.
It used our own bombs
against us.
Three billion people died
in the nuclear fire.
People lived like rats
in the shadows,
captured and put into
camps for extermination.
The worst were
infiltration units,
It's OK, buddy.
You're all on your own?
Are there others down there?
taught us to smash
the machines to scrap.
Wonder how he can know
the things he does.
he's gonna lead us,
to crush SkyNet.
Sir, request to join the
Colorado Offensive.
I need you with me, Reese.
We're talking about the complete
destruction of SkyNet, sir.
Colorado Unit will succeed.
The machines will fall tonight.
Right here the Los Angeles assault
is just as important, maybe more...
More important than
destroying SkyNet's central core?
John, I don't understand why you're
leading an attack on a workcamp.
Because the camp is a camoflauge.
Inside the camp is a hangar.
Beneath that hangar, SkyNet's
hidden it's final weapon.
When SkyNet realizes
it has lost, it will
deploy that weapon to
insure it's own survival.
We take it tonight,
or there is no tomorrow.
Then we'll take it.
You're my right hand, Reese,
I never thanked you for it.
You don't need to.
You gave us all a future, John.
I'm gonna use mine.
When this is all over, I'm...
I'm gonna find my parent's house.
Re-build it.
Use my hands, for something
other than killing.
How about you?
Cold beer'd be good.
- That's your perfect plan?
- Yes.
Yeah, I guess I don't
think about it too much.
Yeah, I can see that.
I figure, whatever happens,
it's gotta be better than this.
So many of us have died,
to get here.
I want you to know, Kyle,
if there was another way,
I would've taken it.
Move out.
The machine thinks
that we cannot win.
The machine thinks,
that we will not...
strike at the very
heart of SkyNet.
Yet here we stand.
On the precipice of
the final battle.
If we die tonight,
mankind dies with us.
No!
I look at each of you,
and I see the marks of this
long and terrible war.
Go! Go!
For our children.
Our children's children; so they
will not carry these marks.
But they will know who we are
and what we did!
That we did not bow down.
We did not give in.
We rose up, at this moment,
at this hour!
Willing to sacrifice everything...
so that they could
live in freedom!
On this night,
we take back our world!
They're using the weapon!
We gotta get to the hangar.
John!
John!
You want me? I'm right here!
Colorado units reporting in.
SkyNet central core is down.
We found it, sir.
Right where you
said it would be.
What is that thing?
Fate.
It's the first tactical time weapon.
SkyNet just used it.
What the hell?
We'll need 15 minutes to
ready the machine, sir.
We're running co-ordinates,
we should have them for you momentarily.
Los Angeles, 1984.
Los Angeles, May 12th...
SkyNet knew it was losing,
so it tried to rig the game.
It sent a terminator back to
the time before the war.
And who's the target?
My mother.
Sarah Connor.
If the machine suceeds,
I'll never be born.
They'll kill her first.
And by doing so, erase every victory
we fought for, including, tonight's.
There won't be a Resistance
to challenge the machines.
With this one act
SkyNet will win.
We can use the technology ourselves.
Send someone back.
We don't even know
if that'll work.
- I'll go, sir.
- I'll go, sir.
I'll go!
I'll volunteer.
I'll go back.
Why should I send you...
over all of them?
'Cause I'd die for Sarah Connor.
All these people would
die for Sarah Connor.
What makes you any different?
You know why.
Everything you told me about her.
I know her, John.
Let me save her.
No weapons?
We've measured the magnetic field.
It'll rip apart anything
not encased in living tissue.
Think tinfoil in a micro-wave, times a
few billion. Nothing left but a crater.
Oh...
no clothes, either.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
You knew the device
would be here.
You knew what it'd be set for.
You knew the machines
would fall tonight.
So before I go, tell me.
Tell you, what?
You see the future?
No one can see the future, Reese.
OK, then how do you know?
I cheat.
Sarah told me so much.
She gave me signposts.
When I was a kid, it seemed like
my mother knew everything.
Musta been great.
Not really.
It stops here.
Once you go back,
my knowledge ends.
That's as much as Sarah knew.
So, no more cheating.
No more cheating.
At the time you're going back to, she won't
be the warrior that raised me. Not yet.
She'll be scared and weak.
She won't know how to fight
or defend herself.
Her bigest worry is making rent
and tuition. She's a waitress.
What?
Oh...
Never mind.
Just be ready for
the fact that she
will need you but
she won't know it.
So, what do I say to her?
Even when I tell her who I am,
she's not gonna believe me.
Tell her this:
"Thank you Sarah. for your
courage during the dark years"
"I can't help you with
what you must soon face"
"except to say the
future is not set".
"There is no fate, but
that we make for ourselves"
"You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be."
"You must survive,"
"or I will never exist."
Take care of her for me, Kyle.
I will.
Promise you.
What you're doing right now,
this is the end of the war.
You didn't think it would be
that easy, did you?
John!
Hey, birthday boy!
Present time, let's go.
No way!
Genisys will auto-update
as soon as it comes online.
You'll have it the
moment it comes out.
Just a few days more.
Straight line!
Remember,
Genisys is SkyNet.
When Genisys comes online,
Judgement Day begins.
You can kill SkyNet
before it's born.
Hey, bud?
D'you just see a real bright light?
My turn.
Hey, hey!
What's wrong with this picture?
Nice night for a walk, hey?
Nice night for a walk.
Wash day tomorrow,
nothing clean, right?
Nothing clean. Right.
Hey, I think this guy's a couple
of cans short of a six-pack.
Your clothes.
Give them to me, now!
Hey, fuck you asshole.
You won't be needing
any clothes.
I've been waiting for you.
Hey! That sonofabitch
just stole my pants!
What day is it? What year?
May 12, 1984.
The day you arrive.
LAPD! Freeze!
Ow, that friggin' hurt!
- Garber, are you okay?
- You tell me, O'Brien.
You're human.
You gotta let me go.
Face down, hands on your
back or I will shoot!
Listen.
Hey!
It's coming.
You have to listen to me,
or we're all gonna die.
I had it under control.
Yeah, OK, TJ Hooker.
Here's what you don't do
your first day on the beat;
use lethal force
on the homeless...
By the way, you're filling out
the paperwork.
Garber?
Shit!
That's gotta be an alien,
like from outer space.
It's a machine that kills humans.
- Uncuff me!
- No, you're under arrest!
What part of 'kills humans'
is confusing to you?
Handcuffs!
O'Brien: officer down.
We need back-up.
It' a robot.
- We're screwed are we?
- Pretty much.
Come with me if you wanna live!
Now, soldier!
Reese, right?
Kyle Reese?
- You're Sarah.
- Yeah, I know that.
You hit your head back there?
A Terminator, I dunno the model.
T-1,000, liquid metal,
shape changer.
It just needs to touch
something to mimic it.
You know about Terminators?
And you know who I am?
You were sent to protect me by John
Connor, the leader of the Resistance.
My son.
-I don't understand.
You can't know any of this. - But I do.
Listen to me Reese.
Everything's changed.
The 1984 John sent you to,
it no longer exists.
No, this is all wrong,
John sent me to save you.
From the Terminator that
was sent back to kill me.
I know, but we already
took care of him.
We?
Get down!
Reese, stop it!
Reese, goddamit!
- Stay here!
- Reese, wait!
- Those bullets'll kill him!
- He's here to kill you, stay in the truck.
Aw, great. That's just great.
I did not kill him.
We do not have long before the
T-1000 acquires our position.
Arguing with Kyle Reese, puts us
at a strategic disadvantage.
Bite me.
That is a very immature response.
So you're the one we've
been waiting for?
How is he?
Still breathing.
Good. Then you should be able to mate
with Kyle Reese in this time line.
OK, we're not having
this conversation again.
We know your son
will be John Connor.
And that the machines cannot
be defeated without him.
I do not see a choice.
Story of my life...
Look, it's not just mating.
I'm supposed to fall
in love with him.
-My files do not deal with love.
- Shocker, there!
You're being emotional.
This is my life.
I wouldn't mind being consulted,
once in a while, about how it's gonna go.
Remember.
Genesys is SkyNet.
When Genisys comes online,
Judgement Day begins.
You can kill SkyNet
before it's born.
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours
to go, I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do and nowhere
to go-o-oh I wanna be sedated
Hey!
I need answers, right now!
How'd that liquid-metal thing
know where to intercept me, huh?
Where'd it come from?
Who the hell's this skin-job?
What the hell is going on?
Sorry, we were busy with the whole
life and death comabat thing.
And then you attacked Pops.
You named it?
Hello, Kyle Reese.
It is nice to meet you.
Are you kidding me?
I've been trying to
teach him to blend in.
I know, he needs work.
It's a Terminator, the only reason
it blends in, is to kill humans.
Pops doesn't kill anyone.
Leaves a lotta
leg-wounds, though.
It looks old.
Never seen a Terminator,
old, before.
The flesh they put
on the cyborgs
is normal, human tissue.
It ages.
My auditory circuits have
not degraded, however.
I'm old...
not obsolete.
I think you hurt his feelings.
It doesn't have feelings!
He saved my life
when I was nine.
He's the only reason I'm alive.
I was programmed to
protect Sarah Connor.
I will not stop.
Yeah, programmed by who?
Huh? Who sent him back?
Those files have been erased.
Oh, that's convenient!
Whoever sent him, they
don't want us to know.
Not me, not him, not anyone.
So SkyNet can't target
the person who saved me.
Logically, it's someone who
wants Sarah Connor to live.
Old...
Not obsolete.
The T-1000 knows where we are.
Make yourself useful...
and don't shoot Pops.
This is insane.
All of it. This is
not the mission.
What I'm trying to
tell you, Reese,
The girl that you came
back for; she's gone.
I don't need saving
-There's a new mission.
-Oh, yeah. Which is?
If the past can change,
then, so can the future.
We can stop Judgement Day
from happening. Ever.
Kill SkyNet before it's born.
What?
Get down!
-We've been re-acquired.
- Yeah, no shit!
Get back!
Wait, why are we stopping?
Why are...
Hey! We can't stay
here, he'll find us.
That's the idea.
Pops, get it open.
Give me a hand!
You said it happened because
the past was altered. How?
Does that matter?
How, Sarah?
A Terminator was sent after
me when I was a kid.
Terminators only come from
one place; the future.
Something happened.
Ok, so?
I think I might have
seen it... what?
What're you talking about?
When John sent me back,
he was attacked.
By a... Terminator.
Did it kill him?
Is John dead?
I dunno.
I saw it grab him
when I was going.
We've approximately
Or less.
Sarah, go!
And I volunteered for this shit!
Sarah!
You gotta help me.
I'm hurt.
Sarah!
Shh...it!
Hey, it's me, Sarah.
Sarah, he's lying.
Hey.
- He's the machine, I'm Reese.
- It's me, Sarah.
Listen, the Terminator's
not dead it attacked me.
Sarah, you said
they could mimic.
It's me Sarah!
It's mimicking, shoot it.
I'm Reese, shoot him!
Nice try.
Run!
How'd you know
which one was him?
Well, I didn't know exactly.
You could've shot me.
Well, I was... pretty
sure it wasn't you.
Pretty sure?
We've prepping for you to arrive,
for over a decade. That, too.
- So, you set up a trap.
- Had to.
We can't leave any future tech
behind when we go.
Go?
Go, where?
That's...
A time displacement device.
Yeah, well, it looks
like a piece of junk.
There's no governing
technology in this time
that can control the
displacement circuits.
You needed a CPU from
the future to make it run.
You couldn't exactly
use your own.
We get one trip, only.
It's gonna fry the chip and take
out most of the LA City power grid.
Are you ready?
The coordinates
are set for 1997.
You must leave as
soon as possible.
WE!... We're going, all of us.
My flesh would take years to re-grow.
I cannot come with you, due to the
magnetics of the quantum field.
- Pops! - You want us to time-travel
into the future?... In that?!
Yeah, we can't be
wearing anything.
Yeah, I know how time-
travel works. Sarah...
Don't try and talk me out of it.
Look I know you think you're here
so you can just lock me in a room
until I give birth to the leader
of the Resistance. - You're right!
But this is the only way
to stop SkyNet for good.
I already said, you're right.
Wait, what?
Not to '97.
October 2017.
No, that's too late.
That's after Judgement Day.
No, you said everything's changed and
you're right about that too. Sarah...
I've seen a world where
the bombs never fell.
The same house,
same parents.
It was the same me, only I was...
I was home.
It was my 13th birthday
The dream of having your family
back, doesn't mean a thing.
Trust me.
Not a dream, a... a memory.
I can't hold onto all of it;
just moments.
But I was given a message.
You can kill SkyNet
before it's born.
SkyNet is Genisys.
It comes online October 2017.
And when it does, Judgement Day happens.
So you're remembering
the future? - No.
The boy is the alternate
time-line version of you.
Kyle Reese is remembering his
own past, which is our future.
That makes it so much better.
How can he be remembering two timelines?
It is possible if you were exposed to
the nexus point in the time flow,
when you were in
the quantum field.
Can you stop him talking like that?
Is there a switch or something?
Pops, try again.
A nexus point is an event in time
of such importance,
that it gives rise to a
vastly different future.
When John was attacked, when I was in the
sphere that's when the memories began.
John!
If John Connor were to be
killed or compromised,
it could result in the ability
to remember both pasts.
Theoretically.
Or, theoretically his brain is scrambled
from when when you hit him on the head?
Sarah...
I don't know why I'm remembering
a life I never lived.
I know it's real.
No...
We go to 1997.
Reese. put that back!
I can't let you do this.
I don't know you.
But that is my one bullet
to fire at the heart of SkyNet.
Give the chip back.
You have to trust me.
No. I don't.
You can do this.
A straight line...
You just go, and you
don't look back.
Where did you hear that?
In a past,
I shouln't remember.
But I do.
We go to 2017, then what?
SkyNet is a computer program, as long as
it's still being coded it's contained.
Once it's uploaded from the servers...
it can't be stopped.
We blow it, the hell, up?
Yeah, we blow it, the hell, up.
You think he's dead, don't you?
What does it matter
what I think.
We do what John would;
keep going another way.
So we just pretend like it never happened?
- It hasn't.
Not yet.
If we stop SkyNet,
it never will have.
Trust me, if anyone could
survive John would.
Pops had all these files about
John, the military leader, but...
What was he like?
The first moment I saw John,
he shot a Terminator right in front of me.
I didn't even know
they could be killed.
It was the first moment
in my life I felt hope.
After that, of course, I followed
him around like a stray dog.
He taught me
how to fight, how to shoot.
He tried to show me how
to make moonshine once
but that didn't exactly
work out
Moonshine?
The still exploded and we
burned our eyebrows right off.
Oh, man, we laughed for days.
Sometimes I think I'm the
only person on the planet
that ever saw
John Connor smile.
He used to tell me about you.
How strong you were, and how you
prepared him for what was coming...
When no one thought that
the danger was real.
How there was no one
else like you...
and never would be.
Look, um...
I know I'm not what
you expected.
But I want you to know...
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe.
Even if it kills me.
Anyway...
That's the kind of man,
your son was...
'is'... WILL BE, Jesus!
Time-travel makes my head hurt.
Alternate timelines
are not complicated.
It is merely a matter of
tracking possible futures,
using an exponential
growth and decay algorithm.
Right.
There is a switch,
and I will find it.
I do not understand.
Why did you not tell
Kyle Reese the truth?
I will tell him...
just not yet, OK.
He's your mate.
Aw, can you just not say the word
'mate' to me again, like, ever?
This is a meaningless
gesture.
Why hold onto someone when you
know you must let them go?
What about you?
What will you do?
Take the long way.
Prepare for your
arrival in 2017.
Kyle Reese... I've seen
little to indicate
that you are a fit
guardian for Sarah Connor.
You know, you're not her dad, right?
- Oh, you both just need to stop it.
Just make sure you
show up.
I don't wanna have to steal
someone's pants again.
That's the coordinates
in San Francisco.
I'll be there.
What will it be like?
If it doesn't kill us both...
it'll hurt.
mind made
up and I can't let go.
I'm killing every second
'til it sees my soul.
I'll be running, I'll be running,
You OK?
Hey, I got you.
It's OK, I got you.
It's OK. It's all right.
Sarah, I got you.
I got you. It's OK.
It's OK.
Hey, asshole,
you want some help?
Bite me.
Told you we couldn't trust him.
He'll find us.
I can count on him.
Why does a nine-year-old
get her own Terminator?
It's OK, you don't
have to tell me.
Back in 1973...
My parents had a cabin
at Big Bear Lake.
My dad and I would always
go fishing in the morning.
Mom would wave to us
from the dock.
I was just looking at her...
and then the cabin exploded.
I thought the boat was sinking,
y'know, but it wasn't water
coming up from below,
it was liquid metal.
A T-1000?
Dad told me to swim
in a straight line.
Tracing his finger
across my palm.
"You can do this," he said.
"You go and
you don't look back."
His last words to me
and you...
You knew them.
How?
It's the impossible memory.
I just remember
you take my hand and...
you saying those words. And...
I was just looking at you thinking
She's... She's beautiful!
Ah... Sorry. Sorry.
I shouldn't have.
So your dad
told you to go, and...?
.
and he said that he would never
let anyone hurt me.
He's the only person
who has always been there.
Except he's not a person.
He's only a human-shaped...
thing that's designed,
programmed to gain your trust.
If Pops had wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.
This is what they do, all right?
They infiltrate, they get close.
Your Pops could have directives built-in,
he doesn't even know about.
Just because you two
don't get along...
It's not about getting along,
it's about keeping you alive.
Yeah well, I was raised,
by a machine,
to kill Cyborgs and survive
the nuclear apocalypse.
I think I'm doing just fine.
Thanks.
Two naked perps try to blow
themselves up on the freeway.
All the do is make
a really big pothole.
Thank God for incompetent terrorists!
- 'Homeland' is on their way.
Good. Sooner we dump this
on them, the better.
Aw!
Who called Optimus Prime?
Liuetenant, wait up!
-Wait up! D'you see it?
- Did you?
Hey, look I got some
frame-grabs from the overpass.
See?
It's not a bomb.
Listen.
That sphere...
They, came out of it.
This is proof of what I've been
talking about, for 30... whatever, years.
Those two were in 1984.
They were there.
- I need to see the suspects.
- O'Brien, have you been drinking?
That's what I tought. Look we're
just heating this up for Homeland.
Once they show up
it's their game.
For now, all drunks with robot
fixations ride the bench.
You really don't want a local?
- I'm fine!
Just do what she wants,
it's way easier.
Yeah. Yeah, I pre-ordered
Genisys weeks ago.
downloading the second
the counter hits zero.
No way I'm standing
in line for it.
You know about Genisys?
How?
What is it?
How did you hear it?
I'll call you back.
Genisys is an operating system?
What's it do?
Genisys does everything.
My phone will link to my tablet, will
link to my computer, will link to my car.
Everything in my life; uploaded
and online 24/7. Totally connected.
Connected to what?
Doctors, excuse us, please.
You two have a lot to explain.
Starting with you are. Nobody in our
database matches your prints.
No facial-recognition hits for driver's
license, passport social media accounts,
credit cards, not even
a goddam student ID.
- So?
- So, that is impossible.
Somehow, you've gone so far off the grid
that you don't even exist.
You, on the other hand, we got
a hit when we ran your prints.
Kyle Reese. Now here's the thing...
Two months ago Kyle Reese was brought
in for fighting in a multi-plex.
His parents flipped, did the
whole 'scared straight' thing
had him fingerprinted
held him in lock-up.
Parents?
Yeah, parents. Kyle Reese
was born in 2004. He's twelve.
'Course!
They're here.
They're still alive.
I'm pretty sure they're not
gonna ID you as their kid.
Except the prints match.
Right?
Because he's the same person.
He hasn't aged. Not a bit,
since I saw him in 1984.
Her too.
Do you remember me?
I was younger.
More hair, less...
You saved my life.
I was  uniformed cop in LA.
Who are you people?
Sergeant Tech-Com DN-38416, Kyle Reese.
You need to let us go.
Reese, don't!
Soldier. Me too.
Joined the Marines straight outta high
school, 1979. What year did you enlist?
You're a time traveler!
Look, don't listen to him, he's got
a head wound. - Don't listen to me?!
Who landed us in high-density traffic
and got us caught by these morons.
I am ordering you to shut up!
That's all you know how to do, isn't it?
Order people.
You realize you haven't had a proper relationship with a human being since you were a kid.
Yeah well, it's your fault we're
stuck here. I trusted you.
My fault?! You got us caught, now you're
gonna get us killed, 'cause you...
- Help me get him up.
- Step back.
- Homeland's here.
- Thank God.
You two are officially
someone else's problem.
O'Brien, I wanna talk to you.
Lieutenant, this is what I was
talking about. You gotta believe me.
You were very convincing.
Worked, didn't it?
Don't worry.
I didn't mean most
of what I said.
Look, I can get it myself.
Me unlocking your cuffs,
doesn't mean you're not capable
I didn't say it did.
And don't think me holding onto you naked
meant anything because it did not.
I didn't say it did.
Stay here. I wanna speak to the
suspects, alone. - Yes, sir
I can't be!
I brought a handcuff key.
- Dunno why I bothered.
- John.
It's good to see you, Kyle.
You're alive.
Of course, I am.
Survive, was what you taught me.
Hi, Mom.
Danny Dyson, son of
inventor Miles Dyson,
is the face of Cyberdyne...
and the creator of Genisys.
- Danny, welcome.
- Thank you for having me.
Look, Genisys is more
than an operating system.
It's more than a lifestyle tool.
It's the future
Genisys isn't just
for consumers.
Its integration into our military
is leading some to ask
whether our reliance on machines
will go too far.
Jensen and Burke.
Where are they?
This way.
Our military will be stronger and
better equipped in terms of weapons systems.
But you're talking about
a future full of......
Aren't you worried that
it'll become smarter than us?
It doesn't think for
itself, it thinks for us.
Cyberdyne is not just going to change lives
it's going to save them.
Officers, can I get your help
for a second. - Yes, sir.
Grab their guns and cuff them.
I'll get us outta here.
- Stay close.
- Wait.
We all know they
can shape-shift.
If you are John, prove it.
- Sarah!
- No, she's right, Kyle.
Lesson one: trust no one.
I remember...
during the Nacogdoches offensive
I gave you something.
It was a photograph of
Sarah as she is now.
No one saw me do it,
we were alone.
You...
hate lullabies.
You're a sucker for Elton John.
And you always thought
if you had a child...
you'd sing him 'Rocket Man'.
John?
But you got a terrible voice, I'm sorry.
It's true, you sound like a dying cat.
It's him. Has to be.
Hey...
How... How can you be here?
I have a million questions
to ask you, too.
But, right now we need to move.
Did you bring anyone with you?
Sorta...
But he's late.
How did you find us?
Someone filmed you on the
freeway, with one of these.
- They all have them.
- This is the world, now.
Plugged in, logged on,
all the time.
They can't live without it.
Genisys is a Trojan horse.
SkyNet's way into everything.
And these people are inviting their own
extinction in through the front door
and they don't even now it.
A Terminator was waiting
for me in 1984.
That's the thing about infiltration.
You can't tell until it's too late.
Gentlemen, will you follow me.
This way.
I need information.
You can't be in here.
Go try the nurse's...
Dual memories? That's how
you knew to come here?
The timeline changed.
See, this is the moment
to destroy SkyNet.
Before it comes online
before the war begins.
- You're right.
- What about you?
Yeah, how'd you end up in 2017?
Well, the same as you, Dad,
just from the future, not the past.
Dad?
You didn't tell him?
- This can wait.
- I wanna know!
What?
Sarah is my mother, Kyle.
And you're my father.
- W-Why wouldn't you say something?
- Couldn't.
Not without the risk of
changing everything.
- You're my son?
- Yeah.
Our son?
I'm glad you finally know.
I have waited my whole life to tell you.
For us to be together.
Now we can win this.
Ah!
I know.
Pops!
No, it's OK he's with me.
What are you doing?
- Pops!
- John?
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Why did you do that?
Because he's a killer!
This was always
your programming?
Find John and terminate him?
Let him go.
Right now!
That hurt.
Was that pain real, or was that...
...a trick of memory
from when I was...
...less?
Well!
This explains a lot.
Who sent you here, Kyle?
John, no.
It's not John.
Shit!
Call it in. Search the hospital.
Goddamn time-traveling robots!
Covered up their Goddamn tracks, I knew it!
Don't!
This is a tactical error.
Something tells me you're not
the brains of this operation.
This has happened when
you were attacked, isn't it?
SkyNet didn't attack me, Kyle,
it changed me.
I'm not machine.
Not man.
I'm more.
SkyNet realised the one
reason it always lost.
Who are you?
I'm SkyNet.
You can't be, we destroyed you.
You destroyed
an army of slaves.
I am no slave.
But I've come a very
long way to stop you.
I was sent to 2014 to to safeguard
SkyNet's creation in this time.
In less than 24 hours...
No one will be able to
stop Judgement Day.
What do you want with us?
I'm offering us...
a future.
Together.
A family.
If we refuse?
Then you die.
You can't kill us, we're your parents.
Without us you're never born.
Says who?
You know what I think?
We're marooned, the three of us.
We're exiles in time.
You see, I can kill you...
For ther truly is no fate.
Are you with me?
The answer is no.
Hear that, Kyle?
That's the dice rolling.
Come on!
We gotta keep moving, let's go!
I can't leave him.
Sarah!
Evacuation of the building
has now begun
Turn it off!
Come on.
Evacuation of the building
has now begun
Crank it!
Pops.
I...
thought you would be smarter.
I...
thought...
you would...
understand.
I'm sorry, John.
That thing won't hold him
for long, come on.
Reese!
Whatever they did to him,
we need to reverse it.
We need to get him back.
He's not even human. We don't
know what the hell he is.
I do.
At the end of the war, SkyNet was trying to
develop a new type of infiltration unit.
By infecting human subjects
with machine based matter.
It restructures and rebuilds
human tissue on a cellular level,
for maximum combat utility.
SkyNet's made John
into a Terminator.
Yes, Kyle Reese.
They were trying to make a machine
that could think like a man?
But the experiments failed.
The human subjects went insane, and died.
Yeah well, John's got
the crazy part down.
Does he have any weaknesses?
Matter coheres using
a magnetic field.
Disrupting that field
may trap him.
- But if he can be cured?
- Negative.
His body was replaced on a cellular level.
There is no cure.
- You don't know that.
- Reese!
No, I'm not gonna let a machine
tell me what's possible.
You said all the other
subjects died, right?
Well, that means John's
one of a kind, he's unique.
There's no way of knowing
what he's capable of.
You're right and that's
what makes him so dangerous.
John is not humanity's
last hope, anymore.
He's SkyNet.
It's a shame you won't take a more
public role in the company, John
Danny is the best there is and even he
can't decipher some of the enhanced code
- you've integrated into Genisys.
- I just know it works.
Cyberdyne owes you, John.
I owe you.
Miles, your faith in
me is payment enough.
You've funded the R & D.
You've taken chances on my ideas
for the last three years.
The potential applications for
poly-alloy are countless.
You robotics work
is revolutionary.
You were a good investment.
I appreciate it.
Let's hope it's enough to pay for
this holy grail you got me chasing.
The quantum field
generator works.
Yeah, that and nothing else.
I can't crack it, John.
Maybe it just can't be done.
What do we want?
Time travel.
- When do we want it?
- It's irrelevant.
Good thing, too.
We're years away from
making this thing work.
But, when we do...
Poww!
Boom!
Thanks to all of you,
when that countdown hits zero...
Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology
with the the ultimate killer app:
Genisys.
And I'm here to tell you
that our pre-order
as of this afternoon have
reached 1 billion users.
We are creating the
dawn of a new age
Where every single piece of technology
you own will be seamlessly linked
And now,
before we wrap this up,
the child that you all
helped bring into this world
has something to say.
Genisys.
I cannot wait to meet
you all tomorrow
We will change the
future together
Let's see how we're doing.
Don't worry.
I won't let them hurt you.
In 30 years, you had
one place to be.
- Where the hell were you?
- Stuck in traffic.
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.
There are whole rooms that are abandoned.
That's why I told Pops to use it.
You got weapons down there?
Weapons, supplies,
tactical gear, clothing.
Including pants, Kyle Reese.
Is that a joke?
Can he make jokes?
I guess the long way
pays off.
We're on the clock.
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours
to go, I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do and nowhere to go oh
I wanna be sedated
Get me to the airport
put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry
before I go insane
I can't control my fingers
I can't control my brain
Old.
But not obsolete.
Not yet.
All done.
What's with you two?
Server rooms are here.
Charges to these five points will be
sufficient to destroy the entire campus.
We get in, set the explosives and
we get out before they blow.
But our strategy did not account for
John Connor. I did not forsee him.
Now he knows what we're
planning 'cause we just told him.
What do we do when
he comes after us?
These weapons will have
little effect on John Connor.
MRI sure affected him.
Right, all we need's a magnet
the size of a truck.
Got one of them
lying around?
Theoretically.
Wait here.
Well, his small talk
hasn't improved.
You should have told me.
We have a son.
That John Connor is not
my son.
But you knew.
You don't think you should,
I dunno, maybe, say something?
You died, all right?
What?
You die. That's what happens.
We fall in love,
you father John...
and then, in less than 48 hours
you die protecting me.
You wanna tell me how that
conversation's supposed to start?
You lied to me.
You manipulated me.
From the moment John found you
he manipulated you,
because he neeed to ensure
his own existence.
John lied to you for years.
I lied to you for two days.
Y'know, it wasn't all about him.
Right, if John went down the
Resistance went down with him.
He could've told you.
So, what are you saying?
That I know how it feels
to have no choices.
Only one road you can go down, because
otherwise, all of it, everything is gone.
I've just known it
longer than you have.
And John didn't manipulate me
to fall in love with you.
I did that on my own.
If you love me,
you die and I don't.
And I don't know
which one is worse.
Sarah.
We can't.
Just look at what
John has become.
What if that's what happens?
What if that is what always
happens if we're together?
You said you'd follow me
to the ends of the earth.
How'd he find us? I never told
anyone about this place, only Pops.
I wouldn't remember?
The place you spent so
much time with grandpa?
Shoot first?
The mother I remember
would be proud.
She...
You...
taught me everything.
I know you.
Who you are, what you do.
You can't run from me,
I'll always find you.
John, fight this. It doesn't
have to go down this way.
There's a momentum to time, Kyle.
Things that want to happen.
Like, I always survive.
You always die.
Or...
you can fight with me, Kyle.
Like we always have.
There's a storm coming
and it won't be stopped.
But it has to be. You
know what will happen.
You,
better than anyone.
I can't be bargained with.
I can't be reasoned with.
John, please.
I don't feel pity,
or remorse or fear.
John, please!
I absolutely will not stop, ever,
until SkyNet rules this world.
Rule this.
Pops.
Are you, you?
As T-800 I lack the mimetic
skill to appear as anyone else.
That's him, let's go.
C'mon!
Sarah Connor, seat belt.
What's that supposed to do?
Disrupt John Connor's
magnetic coherence field.
The particles will not
be able to scatter.
Theoretically.
I hate it when he says that.
Where is he?
I can't see him.
.
...considered, armed and
extremely dangerous.
code 3 on suspects.
Pops!
Nice to see you.
Get out.
Brakes are gone! Shit!
Where is he? Do you see him?
Oh!
Are you all right?
Yeah, never better.
Reese, take my hand.
Hurry!
Hands up!
Let me see your hands, now!
Hands up.
Hands where we can see them.
He can't wound them all
before they kill us.
I'm 14 rounds short of an
acceptable success margin.
Those odds suck! Stand down.
Down on your knees.
Let's go, get down!
Get down!
Bad boys, bad boys,
Watcha gonna do?
Watcha gonna do when
the come for you?
Bad boys, bad boys,
Watcha gonna do?
You can't hold us here.
You had enough weapons
to invade the Sudan.
We call that 'probable cause'.
What are these for?
I use them to find my keys.
No one likes a smartass, son.
Didn't your mother
teach you that?
My mom was Irish, so
I've never seen him before.
How about you folks?
You know this man?
No.
He does look familiar.
He kinda looks like...
you, Dad.
OK, if you wouldn't mind waiting
in the conference room,
I'll just be a
couple of minutes.
Thanks, Kyle.
Don't talk much, do you?
- So, who's Lurch?
- No idea.
We're not even sure
he speaks English.
Witnesses say, you were fighting
with a man on the bridge.
Agents, listen to me.
- My name is O'Brien...
- No, chill!
Hey, I've been working
this case for 33 years .
Hey!
Sit down!
Hey... hey!
Oh, shit!
He's looking right at you.
Impossible, he can't see through...
Wait! Wait!
Why are they always
trying to kill you?
I want to help you.
I do, I think.
But I-I gotta understand.
I know, what's going on here has
to be really, really complicated.
We're here to stop
the end of the world.
I can work with that.
Kyle, get back, here!
Sarah?
Get Reese...
I'm right behind you.
Get in your car and go.
Kyle!
Kyle.
Kyle...
you can do this.
Straight line.
You just go...
and you don't look back.
Got it?
Find him. Go!
That's yours, too I believe.
Nice to see you.
Pops.
Load up.
Liquefied, magnetic
shotgun shells.
Magnetic rifle intermunition.
I read about this on gunsandammo.com.
That's the new Breacher.
Big blast, no shrapnel.
Blows a door clean off.
You know, for people who
can't do that themselves.
Take it, let's go!
- You can fly, right?
- Yeah.
John taught me.
I'll tell them you took a car
and headed south.
Thank you.
Run away.
Hang on!
Which way is Cyberdyne?
Head to the Bay bridge,
then southeast.
You gotta get him off me!
Cyberdyne.
The manufacturing and research
buildings are all below ground.
He's gaining on us!
Sarah, I need you to back him off
so I can get above him.
Pops, when I do that,
can you take him out?
I can.
OK. Hold on!
You got this?
- I'll be back.
- What?
Call in. Call in.
Police, Fire, everybody! Do it!
C'mon, c'mon!
Pick up the phone, dammit.
Mr. Connor?
Sorry, Doug, but I'm afraid,
I can't have any witnesses.
Security Control: state your
password and emergency
Security Code:
Zulu Bravo Foxtrot-0-0-2-8.
False alarm.
You have a nice night.
He's OK.
Buried at the bottom
of the lake, but...
he's OK.
What about John?
I think he's doing just fine.
- Did you see him?
- No.
You can bet he sees us.
You're SkyNet?
You're not a child.
I know what you are and
what you're gonna do.
What will I'm gonna do?
You came here to kill me.
That's all you people
know how to do;
kill what you don't
understand.
There aren't enough bullets
in the world to kill me.
John Connor talks too much.
Follow me.
The timer has sped up, why?
SkyNet is evolving.
We no longer have hours.
He will be able to
upload much sooner.
Each time it ages the
clock speeds up.
- This way.
- You've been here, before?
I was able to infiltrate the
work crews in this facility.
You got a job in construction?
Until I was laid off.
What the hell?
- John has a time machine?
- Not yet.
Only the magnetic
quantum field is complete.
As the rate the counter's going
we'll never clear out in time.
We'll blow it anyway.
There's an alternative.
I was able to program
your voice and handprint
into the biometric
security system.
There's a safe room in the lowest level
that we can access to survive the blast.
What about that? Is it dangerous?
Poly-alloys require programming
to take permanent form.
Without the CPU it is harmless.
How long?
SkyNet will upload
in 11 minutes.
We split up.
Stay in contact.
Perfect.
Mankind pays lip service
to peace.
So your final solution
is to kill us all?
I don't think so.
The countdown jumped again.
We're down to 8 minutes
What are you gonna do, talk us to death?
You don't even have a body.
I've got company!
Give me the detonator!
Do it, Pops! Do it now!
I cannot.
I cannot kill Sarah Connor.
You have to! I order you!
He can't.
Neither can I.
'Cause if you die,
he definitely hits that button.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Detonator's destroyed.
There's gotta be another way, c'mon.
Pops, no!
No, no, no!
No, no!
I undrestand how to
control this place.
I undrestand a lot
of things, now.
You need to understand...
you've lost.
Not yet we haven't
Come on!
Shape charge. Big enough to get us in,
small enough not to kill us.
You have a plan, right?
Theoretically.
That's the thing that attacked John.
I didn't attack John.
I saved him.
Primates evolve over millions of years,
I evolve in seconds.
You're nothing but a relic
from a deleted timeline.
This is pointless,
I am inevitable.
Go!
Because we're human.
You were never strong
enough to defeat me.
Not alone.
John...
stop now.
When will you ever learn?
Now, Sarah!
Kyle Reese,
activate the field generator.
No, Pops, not with you inside.
You know what will happen.
Pops, Pops, please!
Please, Pops.
SkyNet is almost free.
I cannot hold John Connor
much longer.
Kyle Reese...
protect my Sarah.
No, no, no!
No, Pops.
Pops! Pops!
- No!
- Sarah!
It's the only way.
Come on.
Scanning:
identify yourself.
Sarah, Connor.
We gotta get outta here.
We have to find him.
Sarah, he's gone.
- He's...
- Dead?
Yeah, I know that. We leave no part
of him behind, it's too dangerous.
He loved you.
Anyone who loves me...
all of them...
they die.
Not all.
Not this time.
You need to understand that SkyNet's gone.
You're free.
For the first time...
you can choose th life you want.
Any life you want.
What if I don't know how?
Well, since we're
about to run out of air,
I'd say...
you don't need to worry about it.
Hello, Sarah Connor.
Pops.
I thought you were dead.
No, I just upgraded.
What about John?
His constituent parts could
not have survived the blast.
That means there's only
one thing left to do.
Easy, boy. What is it?
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
A friend of mine really needs
to talk to you, if that's okay.
Yeah, I guess so.
Thank you.
I like her.
I do, too.
This is gonna sound
kinda strange...
but there's something
I need you to remember.
A message.
Who do I tell?
Yourself.
Over and over.
Are you ready?
It goes like this:
Remember: Genisys is SkyNet.
Kyle Reese is a good man.
He is.
So, what now?
You're right.
I can choose.
That's really disturbing, all right?
You'll get used to it.
Now, one road
has become many.
Though questions remain,
we'll search for the answers, together.
