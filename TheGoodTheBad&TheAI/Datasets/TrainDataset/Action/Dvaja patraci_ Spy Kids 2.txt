HEllo, EvEryonE.
WE want to wElcomE

-- Woman:
Big smilE. Big smilE.
--
HEllo, AlExandra.
WhErE's your fathEr?
HE'll bE hErE.
I'll makE surE of it.
WEll, hEy thErE,
littlE miss first lady,
I'm Dinky Winks, ownEr
of this finE EstablishmEnt.
You rEady to ridE thE ridE
and shrill to thE thrills,
spills, and chills?
YEs, I am.
Right this way!.
Of coursE, that bEhind mE --
thE world-famous WhippErsnappEr.
--
-- GuarantEEd to makE
grown mEn howl
-- likE a cub wokE
at wEaning timE.
--
OvEr on our lEft...
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
ThE NErvEWrackEr --
oh-ho, painful.
Good fun.
On your othEr lEft
is, uh, wEll,
my pErsonal favoritE --
thE VomitEr.
Now, wE tEll pEoplE
not to ridE it
on a full stomach,
but you know folks.
ThEy just don't listEn.
But...
why bothEr with any
of thosE?
You'rE hErE
for my latEst and grEatEst.
For your pErsonal amusEmEnt
and complEtE gratification,
I humbly offEr...
thE JugglEr.
But is it fast?
--
--
Is it fast?
WEll, lEt's sEE, shall wE?
ThE ridErs arE strappEd
into thE bubblE.
ThE hydrobot lifts thE bubblE
high into thE air.
And spins it round and round
as fast
as thE UnitEd StatEs govErnmEnt
will allow.
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
ThE bubblE spins, turns,
flips, and bouncEs.
-- Aah!
-- Aah!
-- Aah!
And thEn...it jugglEs you.
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
I want to go on!
I thought so.
Now, undErstand -- thE ovErridE
prEcautions arE top-notch,
modifiEd by yours truly.
I thought hEr fathEr
was supposEd to bE hErE.
Man: ThE prEsidEnt
has morE prEssing businEss
than to spEnd
an EntirE Sunday
in a thEmE park.
No onE's that busy.
HavE fun, kid.
--
-- WE'll takE it a littlE slow,
just makE it fun.
--
--
--
-- Mm-hmm.
Can't you gEt hEr down?
SomEbody's jammEd
thE ovErridE.
Why, that
littlE troublEmakEr.
REmain calm.
REmain calm.
WE arE thE SEcrEt SErvicE.
EvErything is undEr control.
-- ThErE's nothing
wE can do, sir.
-- What?
ThE wEight of our agEnts
will prEvEnt us from ascEnding
thE shaky prEcipicE
on which shE now stands.
ShE'll fall.
Don't wE havE
any smallEr agEnts?
Bring mE agEnts SK1 and SK2.
-- Coming through.
-- Coming through.
WE'rE rEady.
UsE this -- thE latEst gEar.
WE gEt to kEEp thEm

--
-- N-No.
YEs.
Of coursE.
LEt's rock.
You'rE surE
thEy can handlE this?
If not,
thErE arE two othErs who can.
Bring mE agEnts SK3 and SK4
as backup.
Ugh.
Ugh.
WE got company.
Gary and GErti --
what arE thEy doing hErE?
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh!
ExcusE mE thErE, sport.
WhErE did you gEt that?
LatEst
in ElEctro-risEr tEchnology,
with nEw compositE matErials
and A.l. brainology.
I can sEE
you don't know
what I'm talking about.
Gary, this is my rEscuE.
WE'll takE it from hErE.
"LatEst gEar," my butt.
No, no, no!
You'll just makE it worsE!
Now you donE it.
OvEr hErE!
GEt away from mE!
AlExandra, takE my hand!
Back off!
I want my fathEr
to comE up hErE and gEt mE.
But hE's thE prEsidEnt
of thE UnitEd StatEs.
No, hE's my fathEr.
HE was my fathEr
bEforE hE EvEr bEcamE prEsidEnt,
and hE should still
bE my fathEr now.
I want him up hErE!
Sir, wE havE a situation.
ShE's got thE TransmookEr.
This is now
a codE-rEd situation.
GEt hEr down now!
ThE point is,
you and your fathEr
nEEd to havE a talk.
Up hErE may not bE
thE bEst placE.
ComE with mE,
and I promisE you,
--
-- thE two of you will havE
that talk.
How can you promisE that?
I'm LEvEl 2.
I can ordEr him
to talk to you.
Hi, GErti.
Whatcha doing?
I'm trying to stop thE ridE.
-- Without disEngaging
thE axis?
-- Exactly.
ThEn stop what you'rE doing.
You sEE, thE ridE
is dEsignEd to work
likE a giant magnEt.
If you rEvErsE
thE polarization,
byE-byE,
prEsidEnt's daughtEr.
SEE you around.
--
-- Okay.
Wait.
I took this from
my fathEr's officE this morning.
I'm surE hE'll want it back.
CarEful!
Look, CortEz, you takE hEr down,
and I'll takE this down.
That way, wE both look good.
I'm not doing this
for looks, Gary.
Thank goodnEss
you'rE all right, AlExandra.
WE wErE worriEd sick.
--
-- Oh, boys.
I think this
is what you'rE looking for.
ShE swipEd it
from thE prEsidEnt.
Oh, you'rE in big troublE
this timE, missy.
Wait a minutE.
I promisEd hEr
shE could talk to hEr fathEr.
Oh, shE'll talk to him,
all right.
WE'll makE surE of that.
So, you want
thE Ukata assignmEnt, huh?
Your dutiEs arE assignEd
to you by thE agEncy --
samE as EvEryonE,
samE as mE.
I know. It's just
that wE'vE lEarnEd so much.
Juni and I arE morE
than capablE of taking
biggEr assignmEnts.
But that's not
your dEcision to makE.
ThE Spy Kids organization
is still nEw,
and if you'rE a LEvEl 3
or EvEn a LEvEl 2,
you cannot
go on a mission alonE.
You nEEd morE ExpEriEncE.
ComE on.
Okay, Mom, if you'rE looking
for top-sEcrEt information,
just go straight
to thE sourcE.
Woman:
WElcomE to thE PEntagon.
How did you do that?
You can't do that.
ThErE is no hacking
in this housEhold.
I know. Sorry.
Show mE that again.
I know this hair thing
is onE of my wEakEst points.
--
-- Wait onE minutE.
You'rE gonna look cool.
In fact, you'rE looking coolEr,
right? LikE mE.
LikE Poppy.
And it's kind
of Em-o-tion-al to mE.
You know? Uh-oh.
A knot.
WE arE gonna...
You...
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
WE got it.
That's my boy.
Last touch.
Hup, hup.
You want mE
to tiE it for you?
No, it's okay.
R.A.L.P.H. can do it.
Bow tiE, R.A.L.P.H.,
and not too tight.
Thanks, R.A.L.P.H.
lntErEsting.
But...
hE can nEvEr, EvEr
rEplacE...
mE.
Pow.
Not yEt, but I think
that nEw upgradE
comEs in nExt wEEk.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Only joking.
HEy!
Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids.
Ki--
Joking?
Thank you.
YEs, ma'am.
Okay. REmEmbEr, kids,
this is a vEry important night
for your fathEr.
And if hE's namEd dirEctor
of thE O.S.S.,
bE surE to stand up
and givE him a big hug,
all right?
What if Dad doEsn't win?
WEll, thEn,
givE him a biggEr hug.
Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling,
this is DaniEllE
and DionE Daluc.
-- HEllo.
-- Hi.
ThEy crEatEd lnfolink, sort of
an onlinE trading systEm
for swapping
intErnational sEcrEts.
Hi.
Oh, hEy.
HEllo.
ChampagnE?
Can't havE any of that.
Sorry.
SomEthing doEsn't fEEl right.
No wondEr --
your buddy's hErE --
your buddy
with thE wEird laugh.
HE doEs not havE
a wEird laugh.
WE wErE just...
talking about you.
REally?
Wow.
You look grEat, CarmEn.
-- You want to dancE?
-- SurE.
I don't think that's
a good idEa, Gary.
Family rulEs say you nEEd to
ask my fathEr's pErmission.
You know, you should havE had
that suit tailorEd, Juni.
It's bunching up
around your gut,
and it makEs your hEad
look way too big.
You havE to ExcusE
my littlE brothEr.
HE's still a littlE upsEt
about thE...JugglEr incidEnt.
A good agEnt
controls his tEmpEr.
Just bE glad
my dad isn't hErE.
HE gEts rEally psycho
about this sort of thing.
Hi, Dad.
Um, you rEmEmbEr Gary.
HE's in our organization.
I was just asking your daughtEr
for a dancE.
You know how to dancE?
Fairly wEll, sir.
What kind of dancEs?
All typEs of dancEs.
-- What about tango?
-- YEs.
-- Mambo?
-- Fairly wEll.
-- Rumba?
-- YEs.
-- Cha-cha-cha?
-- SEvEn stEps.

-- Of coursE.
What about waltz?
Y-YEah, I can waltz.
Show mE.
Right.
SomEthing likE that.
All right.
You can go to dancE.
Watch your oldEr sistEr.
AlExandra?
YEs?
What arE you doing in thErE?
Dancing.
Do you always carry
this many SEcrEt SErvicE around?
My dad's idEa --
hE's gottEn
a littlE...paranoid.
WEll, would you dancE...
with mE?
No.
All right,
hold on a sEcond, guys.
LEvEl 2 -- brEak it up!
Why not?
I only dancE...
ballEt.
What
an incrEdiblE coincidEncE.
So do l.
WEll, Juni, I must say,
you'rE a man
of many talEnts.
OnE triEs.
Uh, could you find your sEats?
WE'rE rEady to start.
I must go.

EarliEr that day.
Now it is my grEat plEasurE

YEs!
--
-- I wantEd that assignmEnt.
This is so unfair.
I am proud to claim thEm
as our organization's
top Spy Kid opErativEs!
SomEthing's not right.
And I'm also proud
to claim thEm, of coursE,

This is all wrong.

Starring Minion...

Thanks.
I was firEd.

It was probably my fault,

LEt's go to thE trEE housE.
I got an idEa.
I guEss
I could always sEt up

You'rE thinking

Woman: Your namE?

Oh, stop it, Juni.
Look, do you want

That's right --

So now wE can gEt back

How?
Looks likE Gary and GErti

As you may rEmEmbEr,

Good boy, R.A.L.P.H.
ThE survivors

tEll dElusional talEs
of a mystErious island
populatEd by strangE crEaturEs.
Obviously, no land mass

dismissEd, and thE agEnts firEd.
--
HowEvEr...
thE magnEt ship that capturEd
thE TransmookEr dEvicE
was last sEEn
in this samE arEa.
So, wE nEEd a small ship,

If you find anything

You bEt wE accEpt.
ComE homE, R.A.L.P.H.

Okay, you rEady?
Ukata...
TransmookEr...

ManagE.
PrEss "1" to rEcord.
--
-- MEan anything to you?
SmElls likE thE work
of Donnagon GigglEs.
HE had first contact
with thE TransmookEr tEchnology.
You think Donnagon's thE onE
bEhind all this?
You'rE talking
to a man with four hEads.
Trust mE --
thE guy is dirt.
What should wE look for?
First, find thE island.
ThEn find thE lsland Man.
That would havE bEEn
Donnagon's contact.
Okay.
Thanks, Minion.
BE a good girl
and swat your brothEr for mE.
Oh, I will.
SomEthing's wrong!
TakE thE whEEl!
Got to go.
Good luck!
Slow down! WE'rE nEaring
dEstination zonE.
ThE radius whErE all
thE disappEarancEs occurrEd

HErE!
WE'vE bEEn shut down!

--
-- Ugh!
All powEr is off --
EvEn thE EmErgEncy powEr.
My flashlight

WE'rE stuck, arEn't wE?
LEt's gEt out of hErE.
REbrEathErs.
REbrEathErs.
You got to do it by hand.
What nExt?

UnbEliEvablE.
Low-tEch!
HErE wE go.
Should wE travEl light

WE may not bE coming

LEt's go hEavy.
lnflatE-a-suits?
WE don't havE much choicE.
At lEast thE masks work.
I think it's bEcausE
thEy'rE valvE-opEratEd,
not ElEctrical-basEd.
It's so strangE.
Good luck.
You too!
Stay closE!
--
--
-- Ugh!
-- Ugh!
Ugh. Oh, grEat.
I'm fat!
Was it supposEd to do this?!
It has an ElEctrical
automatic shutoff
which didn't work.
Luckily, wE ran out of air
bEforE thE suits ExplodEd.
WEll, wE can still laugh.
At what?
At whatEvEr you can imaginE
Gary and GErti arE doing

GErti, whErE arE wE?!
WEll...

SomEonE's gonna pay!!

EspEcially...smallEr.
Oh!
So many succEssful missions.
Amazing, isn't it?
REmEmbEr this onE?
Oh. Which mission is that?

Of coursE.
Hmm.
Actually,
that was thE onE mission
wE nEvEr accomplishEd.
lngrid...
don't start

It's funny

No. WhEn I mEntion your

--
-- DoEsn't it bothEr

TEll thEm that I had a --

Mm...dEfinE "invitE."
Donnagon: CortEzEs.

I'm so sorry, Donnagon.
How can wE hElp?
Actually,

Uh, I'm sorry to say
that CarmEn and Juni

-- Communications?
-- NonE.
ThEir DragobSpy ship

--
-- GrEg, lngrid,
you guys riskEd your livEs
oncE bEforE to savE mE.
LEt mE go now
and pErsonally bring
your childrEn back.
No. Thank you.
Thank you, Donnagon,
but, rEspEctfully,
wE havE to do this oursElvEs.
-- If you could providE

and survEillancE support
of our Efforts,
wE'll lEavE immEdiatEly.
Okay, yEah.
Uh, lngrid...
I know this may bE
a bad timE, but, um...
Your parEnts arE hErE.

This is a vEry dangErous

and you havE to wait hErE.
WEll, wE want to hElp.

You taught mE
EvErything I know.
YEs...

Of coursE not, Dad.
SEE you in a fEw hours.
-- Thanks, honEy.

I still don't likE him.
Juni...
Juni...

That wasn't thErE

ArE you kicking mE?!
I'm way ovEr hErE!
I fElt somEthing

ThErE's somEthing undEr mE!
ComE look!
Uhh.
I don't sEE anything, Juni.
LEt's just concEntratE

Okay, it's about 200 yards.
--
-- If wE kick stEadily
at onE foot pEr kick,
wE'll rEach it in, um...
--
-- 25 minutEs?
--
-- I don't know.
My calculator
doEsn't work.
--
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa!
Juni, what did you do?!
ThE air's coming
out of our suits!
WE'rE hEading towards shorE!
"TravEl hEavy"!
Good idEa!
All right.
GivE it a rEst.
Ugh. Ugh.
Okay, wE'rE gonna sEt up
a campsitE,
put up thE tEnt,
build a littlE firE.
And roast marshmallows?
I can't bEliEvE this!
What happEnEd?
--
-- Nothing -- that's just it.
That was supposEd to makE
an instant campfirE,
and that was supposEd to makE
a shEltEr.
NonE of our gadgEts work.
You mEan wE havE to usE

YEs.
Ouch.

Big officE...
DirEctor
of thE O.S.S.'s officE.
Big.
Did you find thE sourcE
of Equal or grEatEr powEr?
It EmanatEs from thE north sidE
of thE island.
HavE you locatEd
thE lsland Man?
HE's somEwhErE undErground.
YEah, wEll, start digging.
I'm on my way.
ComE on, Juni.
LEt's go chEck out thE island.
I just sEt up camp.
SEE?
SurE wish Gary was hErE.
HE'd want to find out
who was bEhind all this.
Aw, man!
All right, lEt's go.
Wow!
This placE is amazing!
ChEck out that rock!
Looks likE a hot dog.
Uh-huh.
WEll, l'vE sEEn Enough.
LEt's go back to thE bEach.
What?
ListEn.
-- I hEar somEthing humming.
--
Ugh!
SomEbody hErE has powEr.
WE nEEd to find out who
and for what.
--
-- Man: DEstination -- Ukata.
EstimatEd timE of arrival --
onE minutE and counting.
How fast arE wE going?
WEll...go fastEr.
With plEasurE.
FastEr.
FastEr.
Can't go fastEr.
FastEr.
I brokE thE fast thingy.
FastEr!
--
-- Ohh.
-- Aah.
Aah.
--
-- All right...
now what?
This is tErrific.
You know,
this is just grEat.
You rEally did it
this timE, GErti.
ArE you kicking mE?
--
-- No. I'm way ovEr hErE,
chEEsE ball.
-- Aah!

-- Aah!
-- Aah!
-- Aah!
-- Aah!

Ugh!
Ohh!
I'm gonna zap that suckEr

--
-- ComE hErE!
Wait!
--
-- SavE it for thE CortEzEs.
YEah...
ExcEllEnt idEa.
I don't gEt it!
I saw it go through this wall.
I don't gEt it!
I saw it go through this wall.
What's your assEssmEnt, Juni?
I'd think bEttEr
with food in my bElly.
I think wE should go up thErE
and chEck it out.
Up thErE --
to thE top of thE volcano?
YEp.
Not EvEn if my micrograpplErs
wErE working.
Gary would bE bravE Enough
to do it.
NopE.
Nothing you can say
can changE my mind.
-- What did you just say?
-- I didn't.
-- RacE you to thE top!
--
--
-- Ugh!
-- Ugh!
Ugh! Ugh!
Ugh! Oh!
Ah. Volcano.
Juni, stay back.
It's not activE.
Aah!
Juni!
Aah!
Ohh!
What arE you waiting for?!
GEt mE out of hErE!
If my
auto rEtractor was working,
I'd gEt us both
back up thErE!
Uh. Okay.
I'm gonna grab your hand.
Ugh.
-- Aah!
-- Ohh!
Okay. Ohh!
-- Aah!
-- Ugh!
Oh! Aah!
My cEllphonE!
-- Ugh!
--
Why'd you stop?!
--
-- SomEthing wrong?
ClosE your EyEs.
Why?
--
-- Aah!
-- Aah!
Juni!
What?!
I'm sorry!
How long
havE wE bEEn falling?
I don't know.
My watch doEsn't tEll timE.
BEst guEss?
I'd say about thrEE hours.
FEEls likE four.
How could you bE Eating
at a timE likE this?!
You know that tickling sEnsation
you gEt whEn you fall?
Of coursE.
That prEtty much wEnt away
aftEr thE first hour.
Whoa!
--
-- Waah!
Aah!
What happEnEd?!
I don't know!
WE'rE floating!
Who arE you?
-- Do you sEE somEthing?
-- OvEr thErE, hiding.
What do you want?
I want to gEt down.
I'm CarmEn CortEz,
spEcial agEnt of thE O.S.S.
I'm RomEro,
solE inhabitant
of this island of LEEkE LEEkE...
...solE human inhabitant,
that is.
And you arE?
TirEd and hungry.
NicE to mEEt you,
TirEd and Hungry.
-- Ahh!
-- Ugh! Ohh! Ohh!
-- CarEful!
You'll crush my island!
Sorry.
WE just fEll four hours.
WE'rE a littlE clumsy right now.
You wErEn't falling.
It was an illusion.
Magic?
SciEncE.
Quickly,
wE must gEt somEwhErE safE!
I'm a gEnEtic spEcialist.
I nEEdEd a controllEd
EnvironmEnt for my ExpErimEnts.
ThE crEaturEs
wE'vE bEEn hEaring?
My ExpErimEnts...
run amok.
What happEnEd?
I thought I would makE
a fortunE from it.
Kids EvErywhErE would havE
thEir own miniaturE zoos,
-- right thErE
in thEir bEdrooms.
--
A miniaturE zoo?
God's crEaturEs...
on a managEablE scalE.
UnbEliEvablE.
I callEd it
"RomEro's Zoo" --
--
-- gEnEtically miniaturizEd
animals.
Lions, tigErs, bEars,
MonkEys.
MonkEys in a barrEl.
CarEful.
CarEful.
OnE day,
I accidEntally mixEd up
two or thrEE
diffErEnt tEst tubEs
and crEatEd
a nEw spEciEs...altogEthEr.
RomEro's Zoo Too...
an EntirEly nEw...
miniaturE zoo...
--
-- whErE Each spEciEs
is unlikE
any crEaturE
you'vE EvEr sEEn.
HorsE-fly?
Uh-huh.
Uh...cat-fish.
SpidEr-monkEy?
Bull-frog.
Uh...
slizzards.
-- Whoa.
-- Stay away from thosE.
--
-- And so, I startEd to think,
-- "lf only I could makE
thEm all a wEE bit biggEr,"
--
You know, for kids
with mEatiEr hands.
--
--
That's whErE things wEnt
vEry wrong.
I appliEd a growth sErum,
and thEy took to it
all too wEll.
Oh! Oh! Aah!
Whoa!
--
-- Oh!
N-N-No!
-- Aah! Aah! No!
--
And l'vE bEEn lockEd up
in hErE EvEr sincE.
I'm afraid to go
out thErE again.
ThEy'vE triEd to gobblE mE up
on morE than onE occasion.
Why do thEy dEspisE mE so?
I crEatEd thEm.
Do you think...
God stays in HEavEn
bEcausE hE, too,
livEs in fEar
of what hE's crEatEd...
hErE on Earth?
Stop looking at mE likE that.
I'm no loon.
What I'm still trying
to figurE out
is why this island
doEsn't show up
on EvEn
our most advancEd satEllitEs.
I crEatEd a cloaking
dEvicE to shiEld my island
from curious EyEs.
Anything ElEctronically
powErEd that comEs
within a milE radius
instantly shuts down.
Any radar that passEs
ovEr mE is displacEd,
crEating thE illusion
that my island doEsn't Exist.
ThE TransmookEr dEvicE.
How did you know?
Your cloaking dEvicE
is highly covEtEd.
PEoplE EvErywhErE arE trying
to gEt thEir hands on it.
ArE you surE
wE'rE thE only humans hErE?
ThErE thEy arE --
two childrEn,
judging by thEir sizE.
What is this?
It's a miniaturE
of thE island.
ThE cEntEr point of
thE volcano providEs
a gravitational basis
for which
my miniaturE crEaturEs
can linE up Exactly
to thEir largEr
clonE countErparts.
--
-- So, whErEvEr your miniaturE
crEaturEs arE on this modEl,
it's whErE thE biggEr onEs
arE outsidE?
CorrEct. I can kEEp track
of thEir whErEabouts this way.
-- SEE?
--
ThE two intrudEr childrEn arE
bEing chasEd by a slizzard.
-- Gary and GErti.
-- LEavE 'Em.
WE havE to go hElp thEm!
ThEy shouldn't bE
snooping around my
island to bEgin with!
-- I'm with you, dudE.
-- WE havE to hElp thEm.
I'm not going out thErE!
I'll bE EatEn!
What a bizarrE man.
-- GErti: HElp us!
-- Gary: HElp!
-- GErti: HElp us!
-- Gary: HElp!
SomEbody!
What arE you guys doing
down thErE?!
That's rEal funny, clown.
GEt us out!
WE triEd to activatE
our micrograpplErs,
but thEy didn't dEploy!
Nothing works hErE.
YEah, wE know that now.
Thanks for thE updatE,
carrot top.
-- Juni, comE back.
ThEy nEEd our hElp.
-- Oh, I'll hElp thEm.
I want to gEt him
back ovEr hErE
so I can push him
back ovEr mysElf.
-- Hurry up.
-- ComE on.
HErE, Gary.
GimmE your hand.
Thank you, CarmEn.
HErE, GErti...
gimmE your hand.
Just wait
till my fathEr gEts hErE.
Your fathEr's coming?
WhErE arE you
taking mE now, CarmEn?
Hold on.
Why arE you still hiding?
WE'rE kids, not monstErs.
What's thE diffErEncE?
RElax.
ThEy'rE O.S.S. agEnts, as wEll.
-- LEvEl onE.
-- ThEy'rE Donnagon's kids.
AgEnt Donnagon?
You work for thE O.S.S.,
don't you?
I work
for a man namEd Donnagon.
Who is this guy?
-- Donnagon's not intErEstEd
in your crEaturEs.
-- Why not?
ThE TransmookEr dEvicE
that hidEs your island --
that's what Donnagon
rEally wants.
That's not nEarly
as intErEsting.
Now that Donnagon's hEad
of thE O.S.S.,
hE has thE powEr
to takE it from you.
What arE you babbling
about now, Juni?
ThE TransmookEr you took
from thE prEsidEnt's
daughtEr, Gary.
It was just a prototypE.
ThE rEal TransmookEr dEvicE
is hErE on this island.
It's EvEn morE powErful
and can shut down
all tEchnology on thE planEt.
You said
your fathEr's on his way.
I think hE's coming
to pick it up.
You'rE all liars.
Do you rEally think you'rE
gonna turn us on our own fathEr?
Did your dad tEll you
thE mission you wEnt on
was just a sEtup
for CarmEn and mE?
-- Why not?
-- HE has his rEasons.
That's what bEing a good spy
is all about --
trust no onE.
How to Be a Spy---
wE'vE rEad it.
WEll, rEad it again.
A good spy makEs
no binding connEctions
with family or friEnds.
WEll, I don't bEliEvE
in that -- do you?
If you want to bE a good spy,
you bEttEr bEliEvE it.
My fathEr's a grEat spy,
so lEt's grow up, shall wE?
WhatEvEr my fathEr's donE,
it's what it takEs to play
in thE big world...
likE it or not.
ComE on, GErti.
LEt's go.
HE's right.
Oh! Why can't you sidE with mE
just oncE?
ThErE arE no sidEs --
you'rE right,
and hE's right, too.
That's what
bEing a spy mEans.
WEll, I don't likE it.
-- ThEn quit.
-- I will.
YEah, right.
-- Donnagon was right --
--
-- ThEir DragobSpy doEsn't
show up anywhErE on radar.
--
I am not intErEstEd
in finding thE sub.
REmEmbEr that yEar
I insistEd on doing thE
childrEn's dEntal work...mysElf?
How could I forgEt?
WEll...
I installEd
a nonElEctrical tracking dEvicE
in thEir tEEth --
my own invEntion.
But I havEn't bEEn ablE
to tEst it,
until...
now.
-- HonEy, it works!
-- Whoa...
Hard to bEliEvE.
But according to this...
ThEy'rE in
thE middlE of thE ocEan.
AbovE sEa lEvEl.
But whErE thEy arE on thE map,
thErE's no land mass.
--
-- How can that bE?
Now what?
SomEthing's got us.
-- Aaah!
-- What is it?!
Your mothEr.
-- Mom?
-- WE wantEd to join you.
ArE you nuts?
WE nEEdEd a biggEr boat.
And wE brought rEal food --
nonE of that frEEzE-driEd stuff
you think's so chic.
-- Son-in-law.
-- YEah?
MakE yoursElf usEful.
Why arE you hErE?
WE wantEd to hElp
gEt our grandchildrEn back!
Ah-ah!
WE will gEt
our grandchildrEn back.
Gracias.
-Oh, wait.
-- You'vE got somEthing
on your lip.
-- What?
-- Ugh!
-- Got it.
Uh, Mom...
Dad, I am a big girl now,
and I can takE carE
of mysElf, okay?
And GrEgorio and l,
wE can takE carE of
finding our childrEn.
No, you don't sEEm
to undErstand.
This isn't you and GrEgorio
simply saving thE world again.
This timE, wE all havE much morE
to losE if you fail --
CarmEn and Juni.
You cannot comE with us.
It is too dangErous.
Oh, you mEan, uh,
wE can't handlE oursElvEs, huh?
--
--
May I havE
my moustachE back...
plEasE?
If Donnagon rEally is
on his way...
...wE havE to dEstroy
thE TransmookEr.
WhErE is it?
ThE othEr sidE of thE island.
Not Easy to gEt to.
ThE journEy alonE
is morE dangErous than
thE TransmookEr itsElf.
-- I madE surE of it.
--
Show us.
You'rE not going out thErE,
arE you?
WE don't havE much choicE,
do wE?
With thosE monstErs
running around?
I don't bEliEvE
thEy'rE monstErs.
MaybE you shouldn't, EithEr.
-- WEll, what should I bEliEvE?
-- I don't know.
You'rE always in hErE hiding.
MaybE thEy
just wanna bE with you.
BE-with mE?
ThEy wanna bE picking mE
out of thEir tEEth,
is what thEy wanna bE.
You just gotta show thEm
who's boss.
You'rE not afraid?
First thing
you gotta do is...
...fall into this pit.
How doEs it work?
SupposEdly,
thEy'rE run magnEtically.
WE should bE ablE to ridE ovEr
a dEtErminEd path.
WE havE to gEt thE TransmookEr
bEforE thEy do.
Right.
Slizzards.
Oh, no.
This is cool.
EE! EE! EE!
Ooh! Uh!
Juni!
Juni!
--
-- I think wE should
gEt off now.
Why?
Trust mE!
--
-- Aaah!
Jump now!
Gary and GErti.
I told you

Uh.
ComputEr:
You havE onE nEw mEssagE.
MEssagE onE...
HEllo, AlExandra,

I'm on a mission...
I know I shouldn't bE.
But I had an idEa

Simply tEll him
you nEEd to talk to him.
TEll him it's nothing urgEnt,
but somEday
it might bE urgEnt.
And you nEEd to opEn thE

So givE mE a call.
LovE to hEar from you.
And right now it's about --
Silly mE, I forgot my watch
doEsn't tEll timE.
HEh.
And, uh --
CarmEn: SomEthing's wrong.
TakE thE whEEl.
Gotta go. Good luck!
-- Juni!
-- ComputEr: End of mEssagE.
-- GrEgorio, thE signal rEquirEs
that you go around it.
-- HE won't listEn to you.
-- HE won't listEn to you,
MothEr.
-- ChoosE anothEr dirEcti--
-- HE wants to makE surE

If you would only listEn to us
and do what wE'rE saying --

lngrid, tEll him

Mom, Dad,
I havE told you bEforE,
and I will tEll you again --

-- Thank you.
-- WhEn GrEgorio

no onE tElls him what to do.
Turn hErE, honEy.
Sorry.
Okay.
--
-- You'rE surE you'rE
rEading that map corrEctly?
ThE coordinatEs corrEspond

currEnt position.
ThEsE arE my childrEn.
And I will find thEm my way!!
Blah, blah, blah.
I nEvEr undErstand
a singlE word hE's saying.
NEvEr.
Not only wErE wE sEt up,
but I bEt Donnagon
knEw all along
that you'd hack your way

I was wondEring
thE samE thing.
Juni, opEn up.

Donnagon wants us
all togEthEr
so hE can dEstroy thE island
and all of us with it.
Mom and Dad -- EvEn RomEro.
WE can't lEt Mom and Dad
find us...
or Donnagon wins.

Juni's still on-linE.
I lovE you.

MaybE this is likE
thE mission of thE spiEs
who didn't want to bE found.
You know...
if thEy

maybE thEir position
is compromisEd.
Now, GrEgorio, don't tEll mE
you didn't havE a backup plan.

I sEnt him for Christmas

Put it back, Juni!
I didn't takE it yEt.
