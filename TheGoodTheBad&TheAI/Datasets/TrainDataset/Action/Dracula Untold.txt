In the year of our Lord. 1442.
The Turkish Sultan enslaved
To fill the ranks of his army.
These child slaves were
beaten without mercy.
Trained to kill without conscience.
To crave the blood... of all
who would fight...
the Turks.
From among these boys...
one grew into a warrior, so fearsome...
that entire armies would
retreat in terror...
to the mention of his name
Vlad the Impaler.
Son... of the Dragon.
sickened by his monstrous act...
Vlad came to bury his past with the dead.
And returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.
His subjects called him Prince.
I call him Father.
But the world would come to know him as...
Dracula.
I left it...
where I found it.
What do you think, Vlad?
Bring it to me.
This belongs to a scout.
One of Hamza Bey's men.
What the hell is a lone
Turk doing out here?
Turkish scouts never travel alone.
If there is one, there is more.
And whatever they scout...
they conquer.
This is washed downstream.
It came from up there.
Broken Tooth Mountain.
Soon it will be night.
They'll seek refuge.
Dumitru, I need you to return to the castle.
Alert the guards and double the sentury.
What? I'm not leaving you here.
The Turks to cross into my land,
unannounced, is a sign of war.
What are you going to do
if you find them?
What are you going to do
if you find them?
What are you going to do
if you find them?
I'll do what Princes do best - negotiate.
Nicolai, Andre, with me.
Anything?
It smells like your feet.
They are inside.
How do you know?
Bats don't come out during the day.
Something's disturbed them.
Come on.
What is it, my Lord?
The floor.
It's crushed the bone.
The Turks didn't do this.
What's that&
We leave. Now.
The creature you encountered
was no accident, my Prince.
Four nights ago every brother of our order
awoke from an identical dream.
I would not have thought it possible, had I not
suffered the same vision myself that night.
every  creature lands siege
to this holy place.
The Romans mystics prophecized
the coming of a great evil.
A vampire.
From the Greek word, ''
'To drink'.
The beast was once a mortal man,
who summoned the demon
from the depths of hell,
to trade for his dark power.
The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish.
But his price was eternity condemned
the darkness of that cave.
Where he remains until he finds another...
to set him free.
Now you know it's true face.
The people of Transylvania are living
in a fear the Turks return.
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.
Papa!
I've missed you.
And I - you.
My big soldier.
What, an embrace, but no kiss?
Are we going to argue?
- You always leaving ?
I've missed you.
Something troubles you, what is it?
Only the impossible depths of your beauty.
Puts the rest of the world to shame.
Pay no attention to your father, Ingeras.
Flattery is a cheap distraction from truth.
Ah, she knows all my tricks.
You're a terrible liar.
It's one of your most endearing qualities.
You're just in time for bed.
- Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
- Of course we can.
- You most certainly cannot!
- Why not?
Because tomorrow is the
day of our recent Lord.
- Ah, of course.
- That's Easter.
What was I thinking...
So, what attacked you?
Wolves?
I suppose.
All I know... is that I've
lost two good men today.
There is something more...
I was the same age as Ingeras,
when I was sent to live with the Turks.
To fight for them.
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.
You're home now.
For almost as many years as you were gone.
I just want peace...
that's all.
My fellow Transylvanians, an Easter toast.
Ten years of peace and prosperity,
ever since our Prince came back to us.
My old friend, it's 20 more.
Hamza Bey... welcome.
We were not expecting you so soon.
Sultan Mehmed The Second offers
his salutations to you and your son.
Thank you. I have his tribute ready.
I am afraid... there is something more
than the tribute to discuss.
The Turks have no enemies here.
Did you not think we would not notice
the battalion of our scouts?
- Missing?
- I did not kill them.
The Sultan's tribute. Take it and leave.
There is one last thing.
The Sultan requires 1000 boys
to join his Janissary Corps.
NO! NEVER!!
Janissaries! He ended
that practice years ago.
If a soldier is plucked as a child...
and raised to know no other life...
he will kill without question,
and die without complaint.
Any who are 15 years of age or older,
will fight in Hungary.
And those from 10 to 14 will be
made ready for the siege of Vienna.
The Sultan expects obedience.
After all... it was your own father
to give you up, without a fight.
Don't, please.
It must be gone.
Courage, anger, even love,
none of this can matter to a Prince.
All that matters is his
duty to these people.
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?
My father gave me to the Sultan,
to prove his loyalty.
Were you scared there? With them?
I wanted to make my father proud.
Do you have to give me to the Sultan?
That was a long time ago.
You have nothing to worry about.
Do you understand?
Good.
If I defy the order they'll kill 100
for every one I save.
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.
Why didn't you ask...
Isn't it possible he might
show you some mercy?
Have you ever seen the like of it?
Soon the entire world will be Turk.
Lord Impaler...
My oldest of friends.
I miss that days together.
All I miss from my time with you...
is the coffee.
It's true that my father's palace was a
cruel place for a young boy far from home.
But soon you talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us...
speakig of which... I am owed 1,000 boys.
Why have I not seen them?
Mehmed, my brother.
- I will grant you anything El...
- I need soldiers...
brother.
Then take me.
I'm worth a 1,000 boys and you know it.
- Those kings would tremble if they knew.
- Then accept my offer.
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side-by-side.
But now I'm Sultan, what need have I
for one more soldier?
I will have my 1000 boys.
And one more.
Your son will be raised under my roof.
Just as you were raised
under the roof of my father.
You may retain your throne.
But General Ismail will remain to see
that my orders are fulfilled.
What is one son?
If you're virile, you'll make plenty more.
You promised this would never happen.
- Marina, listen...
- The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?
You said: 'No, stay my only friend..."
I knew what happens to
the sons of the Queen.
You said tings would be different.
You said if I loved you I should trust you.
- And I love you!
- Then trust me! It's this or we start a war!
- It's fine, boys.
They just saying the goodbyes and all..
promise me to my family!
Stop it, don't touch me!
I won't let them do that!!
I'll GO!!
I can do it.
Proud of me, aren't you?
Of course, I am.
You have chosen wisely.
I have to say, we are a little...
disappointed, frankly...
I expected more resistance... from you.
- Run to your mother.
- What?
Now!!
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what you have done.
It's not a child's place
to save his country.
Get my family to the castle.
Mehmed will be sending others soon enough.
War will come!
You can't protect us.
I'll find a way.
Vlad, where are you going?
Whatever horror in Broken Tooth.
I know it kills Turks.
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving
Neither will you.
Those are meant to reek of fear.
In you... I sense hope.
Your silver offends me,
it from my sight.
What kind of man crawled into his own grave
in search of hope, hm?
A desperate one.
The Turks threaten to destroy my kingdom.
Power like yours... I could stop them.
Save my people. Save my family.
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler.
How is 'Dracula, son of the devil'?
You are mistaken.
It means 'Son of the dragon,
protector of the innocent'.
Do your people how many innocents...
you have killed?
Was it... Hundreds?
Yes.
Lie to me again, and I open you
from your belly to your brain...
and feed you your intestines.
- Thousands.
And when you put them to the stake,
what did you feel?
Shame, horror, power?
- ANSWER ME!!
- Nothing!
I felt nothing.
A greater crime than the act itself.
Then why spill blood, if not
for the pleasure of it?
Because men do not fear swords...
they fear monsters.
They run from them.by putting one village
to the stake, I spare ten more.
Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero.
Sometimes what it needs... is a monster.
And you believe you know what it is,
to be a monster? Hm?
You have no idea.
But I am going to show you.
For centuries these mouldering walls
have been my gallows.
Now I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of your strength.
Your gifts, your will.
A man, worthy of the dark...
and all it's powers.
For if I am your salvation,
you are mine.
Drink, you will have a taste of my power.
The strength of a 100 men.
The speed of a falling star.
Dominion over the night and all it's creatures
to see and hear through their senses.
- Even heal grievest wounds...
- At what price?
Once you drink, your thirst for human blood
will be insatiable.
But if you can resist for three days...
you will return to your mortal state,
having sampled my power.
And perhaps saved your people.
- And if I feed?
- The price will be worse than if
you'd never stepped in here..
Well, I will be set free, having
granted the darkness a worthy offering.
You will become it's vessel, as I am.
A scourge on this Earth.
Destined to destroy...
everything you hold dear: your lands, your
people... even your precious wife and son.
- I would die before I harm them.
- Indeed you will, I'm afraid.
I, however, would at last be free to unleash
my wrath against the one who betrayed me
And one day I will call on you to serve me, my
pawn. Ending the mortal game... of revenge.
- This is not a game!
- Ahh, won't better way to endure eternity?
This, oh Prince, is the ultimate game.
Light versus dark.
Hope versus despair.
And all the world's fate hangs,
in the balance.
And it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint you.
Drink.
Let the games begin.
What now?
Now...
you die.
Papa!
FIRE-E-E!!!
- You came back.
- I always will.
- Where were you?
- Searching for the strength I needed.
You're back.
A good Prince would had given them up!
A good Prince would have
paid that price for peace.
But I give you my word...
we will NOT be defeated!
They brought war to our land!
They will pay dearly for it.
Fire!
Negotiations failed.
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.
Trust only that I will use all I have
to keep us safe.
But we will not be safe if we stay here!
We must leave directly for Cosia monastery.
It's high in the mountains.
Too remote for cannon fire.
It's our best chance of survival.
We'll take a half of our people,
it's not that our absence is noticed.
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here...
he'll come hunting for us.
Word, from Castle Dracula.
Vlad has defeated a 1000 of our men.
Then send a 100,000.
I will lead them.
When I march into Europe,
I will have his head upon my spear.
And his child? At my side.
We can fight the way our great
grandfathers fought.
Use the forests, the mountains around
the Burgo Pass.
- Four or five months of that.
- Not months.
I'm  this war in three days.
Why not two?
That'd really impress us.
What is it?
I need some air.
I'm sorry.
Don't think I haven't noticed
you following me.
You're mistaken.
I follow them. They recognize
one of their own.
The night is their kingdom...
blood - their sustenance.
And some many say - have lived for as long
as there have been prey to devour.
Spare me your .
They say that one, who
escaped the mountain,
hides behind the face of a man.
Well, if that man is me...
you know a knife would not
do you any good.
Of course not.
Why do you think I stayed?
I know there is only...
so far on this Earth... we can run.
And it is not... far enough.
Let me serve you.
Stay away from me.
Yes, Master.
Fulfill your destiny.
Set me free...
We found him, in the field.
He asked for you.
A message f-from Prince Vlad.
He hopes... you enjoy the view.
Your scars are gone?
What's happening to you?
I met  fear on Broken Tooth.
Not a ghost... something else.
No! Stop it! May God strike down
who did this to you.
I chose this.
This is the strength you sought?
But why?
Because I sent corpses back to Mehmed.
Instead of our son.
- You did this for us?
- In two days I'll be restored.
I just have to resist.
Resist what?
Resist what, Vlad? Tell me!
The thirst.
For blood.
And if you are to give in?
Then I become this for eternity.
You will not do this, won't you?
I swear, I will not give in.
So God will forgive you.
Vlad!
Mehmed is getting closer.
You might want to move out soon.
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.
- Mehmed's men will be close behind.
- No!
Listen to me.
I will reach you after sundown.
I promise you.
I love you.
My husband agrees with your council.
We will depart now,
under your temporary command.
- What? Where is Vlad going to be?
- Spying on the Turks.
- He insists on doing a reconnaissance.
- No.
- I won't allow it.
- It's too late. He's already gone.
All right, everyone.
Prepare to move out!
Tell the Sultan where his
enemies will be buried.
Listen.
We are nearly there.
COVER THE REAR!!
Couldn't these monks put the gate
a little bit closer?!
Stay behind me.
Didn't the Turks teach you anything, eh?
I saw your blade coming from...
Ingeras, run!
Where is your Prince now?
My Lady?
It's OK.
It's OK.
Dumitru, listen. Listen!
Come here.
Never leave us again, Papa.
Never.
I will always watch over you.
To the gate!!
Keep moving on! This way!
You should never have strayed from us.
- Whatever your reasons for leave were.
- Quiet!
- Get these men off their knees!
- Stand up, do you hear me?! Stand up!
The Turks are coming!
Prayers will not defend these walls!!
Do you believe we can do this?
Mehmet's men will be coming from the North.
Double the sentries on
the perimeter walls. Go!
What's in there?
Something I hoped to never use again.
Come now.
The men say that Vlad has become a monster.
I fear this will only inflate the rumors
of the Prince's dark magic.
Only if we allow it.
Men cannot fear what they cannot see.
Remember when you first joined my army?
You wanted to pick up your sword and fight!
When my generals blindfolded you...
you did not believe that you could
march without seeing.
But you could.
Now march with me!
Your Sultan will guide you!
Prince Vlad, the vampire is
vulnerable to daylight.
And... to pure silver.
Yet the Holy Cross exerts
no power over you.
That can only mean you have yet
to seal your fate with human blood.
Let me kill you now, my Prince.
Please!
Before your people do.
Rumor has spread of what you have become.
You can still repent.
You do will to run, Lucien.
It's true! He's a vampire!!
Listen! He is your Prince!
Please give him a chance to explain!
- Please! Stop, please!
- KILL THE MONSTER!!
SATAN LIVES IN HIS HEART!!
Try to save his soul!
Take him to my room and shut the door.
Do not let him not look outside.
- OK.
- Mama!
This is your loyalty?!
Your gratitude?!
Fools.
Do you think you're alive
because you can FIGHT?!
You are alive because OF ME!!
Because of what I did to save you!!
This is NOT who you are.
Return to your stations.
Believe me, there is still more to fear!
Lord.
If you've not yet forsaken me.
me your strength that I may
resist the darkness.
Allow me to endure this test one more day.
I beg you.
Please...
Are you sick?
If you are sick, thought
make you feel better.
Thank you. Come.
You'll make a great leader some day
You think of others before yourself.
When the Turks came to take me...
you stopped them.
That's why you got sick, isn't it?
To save me?
And I would do it all again.
They're almost here.
Dawn will be breaking soon.
And with it the loss of my powers.
- If we've not won this war by then...
- I will fight beside you until death.
Your death would end my fight.
We have done the duty of any good parent.
Protected our child.
Protected all the children in the kingdom.
Perhaps our destiny was not to rule
in this life.
Do you remember our wedding vow?
Why think separately of
this life and the next?
Then one is born from the last.
Time is always too short
for those who need it .
But for those who love... last forever.
STAND YOUR POSITION!!!
FIRE!!!
WHERE IS HE?!!
FIRE!!
Find your father, !
Where is he?
You can keep running, if you like.
MAMA!!
- Let me go!
- NO!!
Please stay with me.
I can not do this without you.
There is still time for you to stop them.
Drink my blood.
No... I cannot take your life.
My life is lost already.
But our son's is not.
I love you.
Do it now!
Please.
Do it now.
Do you want vengeance?
Drink.
I now know that hell is real.
So I know there is a heaven.
Neither this world nor the next
shall keep us apart.
I will honor your sacrifice and I vow
that our son will be safe.
Of all my worlds, this is the world
I like the least.
Look to the East.
The sun should be risen by now,
should it not?
What IS that?
It is the Prince.
He's coming.
I used to think there were
too many of you.
Now this not enough.
I understand you have a weakness.
For silver.
Papa!
He is waiting for you.
You're slower, brother, and weaker.
Go on, take it.
Is this the monster that terrified my men?
You grow more weary by the moment.
Tell me, how long can you
bear it in here? Huh?
Long enough to strike your name
from the history books.
PAPA!!
Take a last look at your father, Ingeras.
- NO!!
- Look how pathetic he is.
STOP! PLEASE!!
If I put a stake... through your heart...
it will KILL YOU!!
Like any other man.
- A fitting death for Lord... Impaler...
- No!
Papa!
That is no longer my name.
My name is Dracula.
Son of the Devil.
It's all right..
I'm here.
- You old goat.
- I don't feel old.
- How many are left?
- None... except for your son. Of course.
A distraction we can now... dispense.
What have I told you?
Repeated, over and over,
since you were a boy?
All that matters is a Prince's duty
to his people.
Don't you realize?
They are all our enemies now.
When he is gone, you'll be free.
You forget - who I am?
Leave him.
Come with me, child.
Please.
GET BACK!!
A time to stop. Please. Please,
I do not want to leave you.
- You have to go with him.
- No!
Do not leave his side.
I will always love you.
Always.
- No!
- Go.
- NOO!!
- You take care of him.
NOO!! PAPA!!
He is safe now, Marina.
The Turks never conquered
The capitals of Europe.
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.
But... there are no pictures...
or statues of him.
I... am his legacy.
His sacrifice taught me,
that even after the darkest night...
the sun will rise again.
Drink, master.
For if the heart is strong enough...
the soul is reborn.
With each new day.
In life after life.
Age after age.
For ever.
It's beautiful.
The flowers, my lady.
My lady?
- Where are you from?
- A long way from here.
Good night.
Why think separately
of this life and the next?
When one is born from the last.
It's my favorite poem.
Speaks still of yearning. Of one soul
pleading for another.
I'm Mina.
Vlad.
Let the games begin.
