- Mission accomplished?
- Best Beluga.
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?
The trip back from Siberia
took a lot out of me.
Your dedication when you're on the job
is most commendable, James.
Omit the customary pleasantries,
Miss Moneypenny. We're pressed for time.
- Minister.
- Commander.
If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department,
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine.
Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.
No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.
Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.
- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.
One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems,
That is why a private defence
contractor came up with this:
a chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.
and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered
- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.
The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.
Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:
There has been a security
check of the plant?
Max Zorin? impossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.
A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.
the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.
You have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed, 007.
{race commentator} They round the turn.
Just under a mile to race from this point.
- Who is number one? The grey with him?
- Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse.
Yes. Born in Dresden.
Fled from East Germany in the sixties.
French passport.
Speaks at least five languages, no accent.
- The old rags-to-riches story.
- Made his first fortune in oil and gas.
Who's that with him under the hat?
With the red dress. A girlfriend?
American. She's never far from him.
Name's May Day.
{Moneypenny} Come on, Fluke!
Get a wiggle on!
{commentator} Pegasus has come from
nowhere, and as they go for the line
it's Pegasus who storms clear
off Fluke and Cooper Girl.
{announcer} First, number one; second,
number two; and third, number five.
First number one, Pegasus;
second number two, Fluke;
I've never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong.
- Many congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Lucky man, Zorin.
- Could be more than luck, Admiral.
- Fixed?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
The French Jockey Club have hired
a detective, Aubergine, to look into it.
I think I should meet with
this detective friend of yours.
Yes. Might have some interesting
information for us. Set it up, David.
Moneypenny - be a darling, would you,
and collect that for me.
- I'll buy you dinner when we get back.
- Pegasus!
- Ensuite, Lafite Rothschild '59.
- Another excellent choice.
I'm pleased you approve -
since you're paying the bill.
- Cheers.
- Santé, Monsieur Aubergine.
The Sfireté has no information on Zorin
before he came over from East Germany?
Through a personal connection
I saw his dossier myself.
But even Sfireté records
are sometimes incomplete!
Et voici maintenant the fabulous
Dominique and the enchanted papillons!
Perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection, no?
Tell me, why do Zorin's horses
beat others with superior bloodlines?
- Could he be using drugs?
- Nothing showed up in the tests.
Later this month, Zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near Paris.
Security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- There's a fly in his soup.
- Taxi!
- Je ne suis pas en service
- Follow that parachute.
- Crazy English!
- Congratulations.
- {outraged cries}
This operation was to be
conducted discreetly.
It took six million francs
in damages and penalties
Under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin.
What did you learn from Aubergine
before his demise?
Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here.
- Can you help me, Sir Godfrey?
- I may be able to arrange an invitation.
It's a bit short notice...
but I might just be able to squeeze you in.
- My name is Scarpine. Head of security.
- How do you do.
- We have a room for you at the chateau.
- Oh, splendid.
By the way, the preview is in progress
at the main stables.
- Is that it?
- No, no, those are the servants' quarters.
- Catalogue of the sales.
- Thank you.
- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?
- Yes.
He'll be shown last. We expect him
to fetch over three million dollars.
If you need any further assistance
please call me.
- {neighs}
- Steady now, Pegasus. Steady.
- {groom #1} J'arrive dans un instant.
- {groom #2} Dépéche-toi.
{auctioneer} We are now very proud to
present the full brother of Pegasus.
He's anxious to meet you at the
reception in the chateau gardens later.
- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Your driver may stay
in the servants' quarters.
I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.
What do you say, Tibbett?
- Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex.
- Of course you are.
- I'll call a porter.
- Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it.
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.
Well, my dear, I take it you spend
a lot of time in the saddle.
- Yes, I love an early morning ride.
- I'm an early riser myself.
Don't stand there panting, Tibbett.
Start unpacking.
- The reception is at six.
- Thank you, my dear.
Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex
said: there is a reception at six.
- Yes, sir.
- So I need a white jacket and a black tie.
- And if possible, a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my Lord, Tibbett!
Look at the state of my clothes.
- How on earth do you pack my bags?
- Sorry, sir.
Mr Faras told his trainer
he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt.
- Good. Anything from St John Smythe?
- Nothing about the sale, sir.
- But I'd hate to be his valet.
- You'll have to buck up your ideas.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be so damned obsequious.
Oh, my Lord.
What the devil's wrong with these shoes?
- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?
- Terribly sorry, sir.
I don't know how long
you expect to remain in my employ...
- Well done, my good man.
- Must we keep this up when we're alone?
A successful cover becomes
almost second nature.
One minute he's in his stall-
the next, neither hide nor hair of him.
- We should look into it.
- {chopper}
- Another wealthy owner?
- Who knows?
- But she'd bear closer inspection.
- We're on a mission.
Sir Godfrey, on a mission
I am expected to sacrifice myself.
Enjoying our little party,
Monsieur... St John Smythe?
Looks as though you'll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow.
May I introduce Miss Sutton?
Sheikh Farouk.
- Welcome.
- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.
Oh, by the way, the name is
St John Smythe. James St John Smythe.
- Hiya, doc!
- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.
- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.
- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas? {shutter clicks}
Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.
Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.
Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.
How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?
But more important
is conditioning and a desire, ja?
Are you talking about
people or horses? {shutter clicks}
My principles apply equally
to human beings.
Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.
- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.
I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.
Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.
Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.
So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.
- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.
I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.
Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.
By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.
- Selling?
- Horses.
Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?
You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...
You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.
- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.
- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?
- {muffled cry}
- Shhh!
- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.
Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.
You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection
- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip
There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!
- Dis donc, on va voir ce qui se passe?
- D'accord.
- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.
Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.
- Aiiii!
- Oof!
- What now?
- We'd better get back.
{Scarpine} It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.
- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.
{Bond} May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.
- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.
Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.
- {Bond} Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.
a compilation of
thoroughbred bloodlines.
Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.
I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.
We have several horses
that might interest you.
Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?
- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.
- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.
- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.
Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.
Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.
Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.
- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.
- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.
Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.
As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.
You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.
- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.
- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.
My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.
they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.
- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.
- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.
But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.
You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.
- Reprisals mightjeopardise operations.
- You jeopardise mine!
Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research centre.
Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,
but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures.
The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.
What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.
You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.
For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.
Today we make microchips
from silicon, which is common sand.
- But far better than gold, hm?
- {laughter}
For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:
you as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information
We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.
Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.
This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,
which accounts for what-
- and leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?
For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.
Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.
Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.
- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish. Hmph!
The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.
- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.
- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.
Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.
- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.
Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.
Last job: chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.
Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.
Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?
You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?
We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.
- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.
His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.
In the war he used steroids on pregnant
women in the concentration camps
- With any success?
- Virtually every mother aborted.
A handful of children
were produced with phenomenal lQs.
But there was a side-effect:
they were psychotics.
Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaub
tried by the War Crimes Commission?
The Russians grabbed him.
Set him up in a laboratory.
He spent years developing steroids for
their athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.
About the same time
Zorin came over to the West.
He's definitely the right age,
and he's certainly psychotic.
- Can you spare a minute?
- Sure thing.
The oil operation looks clean, except
for a problem with the crab fishermen.
Good morning.
Here's that reporter I told you about.
Mr O'Rourke.
I understand you have a problem.
That Zorin oil pumping station ruined
one of the best crab patches in the Bay.
They didn't go nowhere.
They just disappeared.
Well, I'd like to look at
that oil pumping station.
We'll be testing new equipment shortly.
Keep a sharp lookout.
- I don't want anyone near this dock.
- Very good, sir.
- Valves 5 to 15 are open.
- What's the report from the wells?
{female technician}
Valves open and ready to receive water.
{male technician}
Valve 10 at half capacity, sir.
Give me an update on valve procedure
for the Main Strike programme.
{Conley} We'll have a field crew
check it out in the morning.
- Valves to wells 26 to 30 open, sir.
- Right.
Activate pumping procedure.
- Shut down! The propeller's jammed.
- Fix it.
- You there! Get a man down there!
- {mutters orders urgently}
Let's go, move. Come on, you guys.
Gimme a hand.
- Get the alarms turned off.
- Yes, sir.
{Conley} Hurry up, goddammit!
Clear that pump.
- Pola Ivanoval
- James Bond!
- Check the beach area.
- Let's get out of here.
- Would you like it harder?
- James, you haven't changed.
James, that night in London
when I was with the Bolshoi...
Did you know I was an agent
with orders to seduce you?
Why do you think I sent you
three dozen red roses?
Quite a coincidence,
us running into one another!
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- Let's not talk shop.
- inspirational.
- Why not?
' Ohh!
' {music}
You know something? Tomorrow
I shall buy you six dozen red roses.
{Zorin} The Silicon Valley operation
must not be delayed.
Main Strike's in three days.
Any delays, I hold you responsible.
It's essential the remaining pipelines
are open on time.
- May I quote you on that, Mr Howe?
- Certainly.
Is there anything else I can tell
the Financial Times?
Yes. My readers want to know why Zorin
is pumping sea water into his pipeline
Sea water is used to test
the integrity of the pipeline.
It's a lot safer than oil.
Just in case there are any leaks.
Well, thank you, Mr Howe.
That about wraps it up.
If you'd like any further information
just call me, Mr...
- Mr Howe!
- Stacey, what do you want?
I have some porosity tests
I want to show you.
- I can only spare a couple of minutes.
- OK.
Just another Zorin stooge, Mr...
whatever your name was.
Actually, it's James Stock.
London Financial Times.
And you can tell them about the $5
million payoff you received from Zorin.
- What's this loaded with?
- Rock salt.
All the king's horses and all his men
won't do much with that.
- Yes.
- And...you're a reporter.
- What was it?
- Stock. James Stock.
- Right.
- Yes, I'm researching an article on Zorin.
I used a friend's name
to get an invitation to the chateau.
- I'd like to hear them.
- {cat meows}
- What are you serving? Whiskas?
- I only have leftovers in the fridge.
- I'm a pathetic cook.
- I'll lend a hand.
- You can cook?
- I've been known to dabble.
Now, you were telling me
about your grandfather.
He left Sutton Oil to Dad - who expected
me, as the only child, to take it over.
- So at college I studied geology.
- And then what happened?
Zorin. He took over Sutton Oil
in a rigged proxy fight.
I fought him in the courts.
It's taken all I had.
and I've just managed
to hold on to the house and my shares.
And that's what the $5 million were for?
Your shares?
So Zorin sent along his gorillas
to help you make up your mind.
I'd sell everything and live in a tent
before I give up.
- Oh! Reconnect the telephone.
- The box is outside my bedroom window.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- What's wrong with them?
- We had an earth tremor.
They're extremely sensitive
to seismic activity.
Let's see what
the Earthquake Center has on it.
Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5
on the Richter scale. Location...
That's odd.
The epicentre's near Zorin's oil field.
I told Howe yesterday that Zorin
was pumping sea water into his wells.
- Is there a connection?
- Sea water?
- Are you sure?
- I checked it myself.
- What happened?
- I got fired.
- He fire... He fired me.
- All right. Calm down.
This evening we'll meet
a friend of mine from Washington.
Maybe, just maybe,
he'll come up with a few answers.
I wish we could be more specific about
Zorin's intentions before I go to the top.
Flooding a fault
could cause a major earthquake.
On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon Valley.
Could that be affected?
No, not severely.
Silicon Valley's too far away.
But if we knew how many wells were
involved...we might get a clearer picture.
- I still have my security pass.
- Then let's go to City Hall.
- Let me go and get it.
- I'll tell Washington we need more help.
- Good evening, Jeff.
- Evening, ma'am.
- Won't be long.
- OK.
- Main Strike.
- Hey, I know that place.
That's an abandoned silver mine
by the San Andreas fault.
Alive and well, I see.
And still bungling in the dark.
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?
And you, Sutton. You should have
accepted my more than generous offer.
- You can take your offer and shove it.
- Don't bother, Stacey.
- That simplifies things.
- He's probably armed.
- What's going on?
- Tell them...there's been a break-in.
- Police
- Hello.
- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.
- Right away.
- What have they done?
- You discharged her.
So she and her accomplice
came here to kill you.
Then they set fire to the office
to conceal the crime,
Brilliant.
I'm almost speechless with admiration.
Intuitive improvisation
is the secret of genius.
Herr Doktor Mortner
will be proud of his creation.
- Out.
- Let's go.
- {woman} It is the City Hall.
- {man} I'll call the fire department.
- Catch this.
- I can't reach it!
- Now...push!
- {screams}
- {Stacey pants}
- Go on.
{woman} All we know is that there are
people trapped inside of City Hall.
Give her some air.
Comin' through. Out of the way, please.
Let me through.
Let me through, goddammit.
Captain. If you can get to
Howe's office you'll find him dead.
- Yes, thanks.
- Turn around.
If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,
he'll inform you who I am.
- We found his body in Chinatown.
- What?
- You're under arrest.
- Wait.
This is James Stock
of the London Financial Times.
- Is he?
- Are you?
And I'm Dick Tracy
and you're still under arrest.
Hey, where's that guy goin'?
That ladder's unlocked.
Is that true what you said
about the British secret service?
My real name is Bond. James Bond.
You must take my word for it.
{police chief} To all units. Intercept
murder suspect in stolen fire truck.
- Pull away you idiots.
- I can't. The fenders are locked!
- I told you, they're locked!
- Oh, my God, watch out!
- Jeez!
- Turn!
- Swing me back!
- Oh, jeez!
- I think I can get him.
- Go for it!
You'll have to pay for this vehicle.
There's a lot of activity
for an abandoned mine.
That truckload of explosives
should last them for months.
- Where's the fire?
- On your rear end.
- It's the rules. Hard hat area.
- Thanks.
Get a coffee over at the hut.
Come back in 20 minutes.
It's women's lib.
They're taking over the Teamsters.
OK, get this stuff movin'!
We're an hour late.
That's a good idea of yours.
Pity you couldn't find one that fits.
All personnel not on essential duties,
leave underground area immediately.
Standby forward. Bring the gag
up here and clear these barriers away.
{Conley} Come on, let's go.
We haven't got all day.
Hey, on the crane!
Swing the cradle over here.
- You found anything?
- Yes. I think I have.
{foreman} Come on,
lay the head down here. OK?
The San Andreas Lake is right above us.
Lots of seepage. Could ﬂood any minute.
Finish shoring up the roof.
I'll send the lug back.
The ones he's been using to pump
sea water into the Hayward fault.
What are these tunnels for
under these lakes?
These lead straight into this section
of the San Andreas fault.
Zorin just has to blast through the
bottom of these lakes to flood the fault.
- And create a...double earthquake?
- Yes. Except...
Except right beneath us
is the key geological lock
All those explosives.
Would they be enough to break the lock?
Silicon Valley and everything in it
submerged for ever.
If it happened at the peak of
the spring tide for maximum effect...
- We have to go and warn people.
- Wait!
- Get 'em back to work.
- You men, get back to work.
- Did you pass anyone back there?
- No. I saw no one.
- Now which way?
- The map.
- It must be a ventilation shaft.
- Wait!
That must lead to the fault.
The water from the lakes!
- Get help. Quick!
- Get a doctor.
Come on. There's nothing
you can do for them now.
- Up and away!
- {Zorin cackles}
Only minutes more, Carl.
Nothing can stop it now.
I have to get down
and defuse that detonator.
Then we have to bring
the whole thing up. But how?
- Get on!
- It's too heavy. Go!
We've only seconds before this blows.
If it does, that powder keg goes with it.
- Jump!
- I have to hold the brake off.
The ship's nose is heavy.
He must be on the mooring rope.
- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- Get her off. Get away!
- Get a foothold!
- {screams}
- Stacey, are you there?
- You betcha!
- Are you all right?
- {Stacey} Yes. Yes.
The first time ever awarded
to a non-Soviet citizen.
I'd have expected the KGB to celebrate
if Silicon Valley had been destroyed.
Where would Russian
research be without it?
Is Commander Bond here?
I'd like to thank him personally.
{M} Sadly he's missing.
We are continuing our search,
{Bond} A bit of soap here...
and a little soap there!
- Oh, drat! I've dropped the soap.
- {Stacey} I'll get it. Whoo!
- Hello?
- {M} Grandfather calling Q.
- What's the position?
- 007 alive.
- Where is he? What's he doing?
- Just cleaning up a few details.
- Mmm!
- {Bond chuckles}
