The Government Think
It Is Necessary To Amend The History
Evens Are Changed
The Fact Is
They Failed on These Things
To Made Us Belive
They Create The Science of The History
They Should Be Serious
But The Fact Is
They Give Support To The Government
Many People Struggle To Climb Up
Scients Can Do Nothing To This
ofcourse
If I Can Change This Before Us
That Is My History

We Should Change The History
I Mean From
The View of Science To Change The History
A Historian
Do You Want
To observe The Happening of History
Then You Should Face Up To Every Disaster
Yes But It Is Creul
But The Subject of History Is Useless
I Mean
our History Is Uncertain
It Is Said That
All The Research
Based on Events Is Useless
Even You Don't Want Them To Happen
But In Fact Them Have Already Happened
But We Can Prevent Them From Happening
Fact Is Fact
It Cannot Be Changed
our Feelings And Emotions
Shold Not Be Used
To Determin What Is Good or Bad In History
