I beg you, tell them the truth!
Tell them you know me, I'm not a witch!
My daughter! No...
CITY OF VILLACH
Let me go, please!
No! No!
No! Please! No!
You all have been found guilty of
witchcraft and consulting with the devil.
If you would
save your souls from perdition...
...repent now and confess your sins
I confess! I confess! I confess!
Please, I beg you, have mercy on me!
I made ointments for a couple.
But it was just pig's fat not witchcraft,
I swear it!
Priest...
You gonna burn in hell.
Do it.
No! Please!
Wait! Wait!
You said that you're would spare me.
Your Soul, child.
Your Soul will be spared.
But the body must be
consigned to God for absolution.
No! No! Please, I beg you! No...
Wait!
Thier bodies must be pulled up.
There are words wich must be spoken,
from the book of Solomon.
To unsure they not rise again.
They've been hanged and drowned.
That's dead enough for me.
Amen.

- For God. Not for this.
I am a herald of God in this world.
- His voice rings ever in my ears.
- Perhaps it's not his voice you hear.
How dare you?
I am the voice of the church!
Bathed in truth and blameless
in light of the Lord.
You're no more than
a drop of blood on his hands!
Who contorls your insolent tougne,
Behmen?
Let's get the hell out of here.
You can not leave!
Who's going stop us?
sheep roaming free
and no shepherd in sight.
- Did they jumped the fence?
- All of them?
We have been walking all day
and  have not passed a soul.
Keep your souls And only find a chicken.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
What happened to them?
I don't know.
We have seen so much death you and I.
Some deserved, some not.
But What is one do,
to deserve a death like that?
Nothing.
Finally a town!
We might be recognized.
- We should go around , Behmen.
- Go where?
Please, Let them come to me!
I beg you!
please, Take us! No more!
Lord all mighty, Heavenly Father. Accept
the pain and suffering we restore upon our selves.
Find deed to the awkward to free us!
From this Terbile ...
- What madness is this?
- Plague.
Plague?
Like no other
the pestilence over all the land.
- is there no cure?
- None.
How long is it been so?
three years in a season.
- How many died?
- Some says as many in three and four.
But with my own hands I have buried
two children and the wife who born them
But, How is it you you don't know this?
We're travellers
We have only recently returned
Here you are
two of my finest
Thank you
Leave it!
Felson, this way
What is it now?
They saw my sword's Crest
I told we should've gone around
You two! Stand fast!
Shit!
Fine
Come with me
Drop it!
Remove the hood and the mask
Arrest these deserters
Wait!
Let me see that
this is yours?
Follow me
I hope we are on our way to dinner
What you want with us, Priest?
that's not up for me to say
Pardon me, your eminent
What is it, Debelzaq?
This the knight's sword
Come closer
Tell me your name
I am Behmen of Blybrook.
Behmen, yes ...
And your comrade, Felson.
Your names are known to me
Your victories have become legends
Yes, I'm stricken...
The Plague is everywhere
It's a curse called up from Hell
Brought upon us by
The Black Witch
The Black Witch ?!
I myself heard the confession
The Witch must be taken
the abbey of Severak
Where the Monks possess the last
copy of an ancient book
rituals that will destroy
the Witch's powers,
And End the plague
What is this to do with us?
Our ranks have been decimated
You must deliver her
My best knight, Eckhart
has already pledged his services
As has our priest Debelzaq
I ask the same of you
Will you serve the church, once more?
- I can not
- you swear in front of God
- Have you been released from this vow ?
- My vow is to god
Not the men how murder in his name.
You know the penalty for desertion
I ask again
Behmen of Blybrook,
Do you serve God and the church ?
I serve the church no more
In there
Both of you
What do they do with deserters any way?
Hang them?
Burn them ?
Probably both
I know
If I the one who say on the matter
I prefer to hanging
Is that the Witch ?!
That It is not what I see
The priest said she confessed.
We both know the church
can be Most ... Persuasive
ahh
I am Sorry, I Put you into this Felson
Ah, These dungeons go
and this one is not so bad
We spent nights in much worse places than this
At least I have
What's that smell?
That would be you
"I serve the church No more"
Did you see the priest face?
He looked like someone pissed in his holy water
They are godless people! Infidels
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished
You want to speak with the Cardinal?
Tell him we will deliver
the girl to Severak, on one condition
That she is given a fair trail
- You cann't bargain with the church.
- This is not for your church.
And we want our weapons returned
And all charges dismissed
We're here.
The abbey is is here
The distance is nearly 400 leagues
That's roughly Six days travel
As you can see,
We charted a course.
You would lead us through here?
That is the most direct route, yes.
Across the river, through ...
and a mountain pass?
This forest is called Wormwood
It's not a place to be trifled with.
Men have lost their way there,
and were never to be seen again.
Tell me, Priest,
have you ever made a journey yourself?
- No.
- Naturally.
these are the best maps in the land.
But, We will do better to have a guide.
You know, Someone who has travelled
from here to there.
A tax collector, perhaps a merchant?
There is someone, but ...
Ahhh , ...Visitors!
What can I do for you gentlemen?
Perhaps, you would like to  help me with fruit,
or kick me in the groin
You're Hagamar? The swindler?
Yes.
I... I mean no!
I am Hagamar,
but I never swindled anyone.
I sold relics. Genuine Relics
Where did sell your trinkets?
Everywhere.
I have happy customers from here to Prague.
And in Severak?
Yes.  The monks.
I sold them the tail of an asteroid
and a flag from Egypt
- Quite a barging ,I am sure
- Then you know the way to the abbey.
Like the back of my hand.
I'd happy to draw  you a map, only ...
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you
On one condition.
You serve as our guide to Severak.
Condition accepted.
If I were to release you however,
and you attempt to flee ...
Such thoughts are beneath you sir
I swear by all the saints,
me they struck me dead , were I to lie.
and you will have to get in line behind me.
Do we understand each other?
the Witch is unconscious.
she was given a powerful sedative in her food last night
Open the cell.
We will be removing the witch for transport.
she's just a girl.
Do be deceived.
Felson!
Hold her! Hold her!
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.
Now she is sedated
Who is that ?
-The Witch.
- Witch?
Nobody said anything about a witch.
What did you think we are going to Severak,
to sell trinkets?
Kill the witch!
You gave us this infection!
you brought the wrath of good upon us!
take the witch out of our land
And take the plague with you!
Demon!
She is watching me
put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.
It's working.
How did you come upon this girl?
She was found
just outside of Maburn , wandering ...
Muttering strange things words,
no one can understand
- This makes her a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.
And with in the fourth night of her arrival,
Plague has swept over us.
It was the same for every town she passed
there no take of such a girl
passing through my village ...
yet, the plague came
She is stronger than she looks.
Do you believe she is a witch?
But you felt her strength
would You say, it was that of a girl?
I have seen girls destroy men
without lifting a finger.
How many times do we need to go over this?
We were in France! for god sake.
And things she did in the bed chamber.
- She robbed you out of the year's wages.
- Yes, but ...
gave me so much in return.
Look at us.
Barely a month out of service to the church
and here we are !
deserters, in the service of the church.
You know we are being followed.
Let's give him a royal welcome
Come of the horse.
Who are you? Why you're following us?
I asked you a question boy.
He's an altar boy
and services to the Cardinal.
My name is Kay.
My father was a knight. Yuran Wolenbar.
He also fought in "Ambrose"
Perhaps you have heard his name.
- What do you want?
- I want to come with you to Severak.
Easy, boy.
To pledge myself to your service
in exchange, for which I ask your word
that you will vouch for me upon our return...
So I may be knighted.
The services of an altar boy
I feel safer already
I would have you know, I have been written in the lists twice
and I won flags for valour.
That's not a tournament, kid.
Go back to your mother.
This is a free road, old man
And I don't need your permission
to travel it.
Give the lad a chance
to retract the remark.
My sincere apologies.
- Not to me, to him
- That I can not. He insulted me first.
I'm going to teach this one some manners.
go easy, Felson. Use the other hand.
I don't want him dead.
Just send him on his way.
Be quick about it.
With pleasure
What the devil was that?
Stand and fight like a man,
you little jackrabbit.
Enough!
Perhaps you can be of service.
I heard what the cardinal said,
about your heroism in the Crusades.
I'd have gone too, but I was too young.
you're one of the lucky ones!
Well, tell me about it,
where did you enlist?
It was a priest
how came to Felson's village .
He told us:
"whoever went on Crusade, would receive blessings
from the church".. "Remission from sin".
It was the part about sin that
perk young Felson is interest.
That's not true.
So he asks the priest :
"what sins would be forgiven"...
"Would they forgive adultery?"
The priest says :
"Yes, for two year bledge".
"What about theft?"
"Yes, for a three year bledge."
So Felson mulls it over
and says to the priest.
"better Sign me up for ten."
I brought you some food ...
and warmth.
You're not like the others.
You're kind.
Was it Debelzaq, who hurt you?
This place you taking me  ...
What will happen to me there?
Your innocence or
guilt will be decided
There was a girl in my village
who was suspected of being a witch.
They put stones in her pockets
and cast her into the lake.
If she drown,
they would have known she was human.
But she didn't. She lived.
They called it proof of magic,
and burned at the stake.
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.
You will be given a fair trial.
You have my word on that
Did she said anything?
- Why do you ask?
- I only mean to caution you!
The witch is a deceiver.
She will turn one man against another.
who is to guard the wagon?
Guard the wagon? That girl is kid.
- And I'm tired.
- I'll go.
Perhaps someone else
should take the first watch.
I'll go.
Don't worry that. There will be
plenty of time between here and severak.
Eckhart, be watch.
I came to relieve you.
you're not tired?
No. No.
I don't sleep much these days.
I was thinking how much
the girl reminds me of my daughter.
I'm sorry for your loss.
- What was her name?
- Mila. Her name was Mila.
Tell me, Father ...
You say the Cardinal has given his word
that she will have a fair trial.
But has he not also
given his word end to the plague?
What do you suggesting?
Can you imagine the reaction of the people
if she weren't to be found guilty of witchcraft
No Father...
you know as well as I the
church can't afford that ...not now.
No.
No, our responsibility is
to deliver her for trail.
The monks will decide her fate.
Exactly.
The monks will decide her fate.
and I will not be a part of this.
No will the others, hopefully
when they have heard what I have to say
Wait!
Please don't go.
Please, don't leave me alone with him.
are you afraid?
- Listen to me.
- Eckhart.
I'm not leave ...
Give me that key!
How did she escape?
she took the key from around my neck.
which way did she go?
Maybe she
followed this road to the village.
Kay and Eckhart that way
She's in the square!
this is a grave... this is a mass grave.
Father
Wait here.
Papa
Mila?
Papa
I'm here.
Eckhart!
- Mila?
- Papa
- Mila ...
- Papa, where are you?
- Mila! My child.
- Papa? is that you
- Don't run away!
- Papa.
Mila ?
- Papa.
- ohhhh, Mila?
Eckhart!
Felson! Behmen!
Where you are?
He came running out of no where
Why didn't he stopped?
Why didn't he see me?
what dear God? what have I done?
He looked me in the eye, but he didn't see me.
She called me Mila.
Behmen.
I had to Run, I had no choice.
I couldn't let him touch me again.
I'm so sorry.
Please, please, don't take me back there.
Please, I beg you, please ...
Heavenly Father, we pray thee.
take thy servant Johan Eckhart,
down to the Heavenly realm
For he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name
And in the name of Thy only Son,
Jesus Christ.
And Thus did he die
for the glory of God.
Amen.
Amen.
Would anyone care to offer some words?
let his sacrifice, not be in vain.
Behmen!
Behmen, I must speak with you
- What is it now, Priest?
- You must warn the others
be careful in her presence. Not to...
not to discuss personal matters,
things she might use against ...Listen to me!
It was the witch killed Eckhart.
You ...you heard what Kay said.
his mind wasn't his own.
She overheard us talking of his daughter.
What exactly are you suggesting?
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts
And once she sees that,
She will use against us.
Crusader!
I am truly grateful
for your help.
You're very brave.
A man like you could never stand
to see young girl come to any harm
Debelzaq believes ,
you are the blame for Eckhart death.
And you believe him?
After what he did to me?
I had no reason to harm Eckhart
He was nothing but kind to me.
He told me , I look like his daughter.
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind
Allow me to ease your pain.
Some good deeds can done
even from behind bars.
Kay, remember this, it wasn't your fault.
It was the witch.
No one else.
he died by my sword.
-It Could just as easily have been another's
- But it wasn't.
It was mine. I killed him.
Why are we stopped?
You call that a bridge?
Last time I saw it
Was eight or nine years ago.
I remember it differently.
is that our reward for taking a swindler as our guide.
I told you,
I am not a swindler
You're not much of a guide either,
are you?!
How we are supposed to get across this rotting temper
{ temper= The degree of rigidity and flexibility}
Behmen!
Behmen!
Take everything of the wagon
bring the horses across. One by one.
It will be on my count of three.
One, two, three!
My hands!
ahhhhh...!
Cann't hold out much longer!
Help!
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses,
that we will use them to pull the wagon.
If you let me out,
it'll be lighter.
Please, I can help.
- It won't hold.
- It will
Push.
Push!
You won't make it. Let me out.
- Come on!
- Push!
That was a little too close!
I've saved your ass a hundred times.
Have a little faith!
Kay, bring me a fresh wrap Priest hand.
It would be a shame
if you bleed to death
Thank you
Felson
The flask!
Really?
What is this place?
Hagamar, where are we?
Wormwood forest.
Damn fog. Like a veil before my eyes.
We haven't strayed from the path,
have we?
I can barely see my own hand
in front of my face.
The only reason you're around
is because you claimed you knew the way.
I know the way,
it's just I can't see the way.
Maybe you would like to
try leading the way! Huh!
Enough!
Both of you.
We camp here on the road.
Wait for the fog to pass.
Kay told me
what happened on the bridge.
He says , you saved his life.
With one hand ... Hard to believe.
We believe what we want to believe.
Do you believe I am a witch,
Behmen?
You are not afraid of me, are you?
Trouble sleeping?
Myself as well
I'm not sure if it's the fog,  the altitude ...
It's unsettling, even for a knight.
Let alone with a spineless scoundral like myself!
That's not what I meant.
No! Behmen, how many more are
going to die before we reach a Severak?
- None, if I can help it.
- And if you can't , what then what?
Forgive me if I seem reluctant
to put my life in your hands
But I have a better solution.
We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it
We tell whose back in "Mol bow",
she tried to escape.
She meant us harm ...
What can we do? we had no choice.
And who will be the wiser?
I, for one.
Did you hear that?
- What it's it? What is happening?
- Listen.
Quite.
Wolfs
What do we do?
Kill as many as you can.
-Oh no.
- Get the horses, I'll take the wagon.
Behmen!
It's too late. We cann't help him.
Behmen! What are you doing?
Behmen, what are you doing?
- he's doing what comes naturally killing the innocent.
- You can not do this
Step aside,
two lifes have already been lost.
No one grieves for that
more than I.
Step aside! or this arrow will be yours!
If we fault her now,
those lives will have been lost in vain
Or will not be lost!!
Four lifes will be spared.
And what are four lives, compared
with the thousands more will be lost?
if this plague is not ended.
I know, there may be no room
in your heart for God, Behmen.
But in my heart
I know he would not abandon us.
I God's name ...
No man has spilt more blood
in God's name than I
benevolent God,
what are odds thus takes a man
If you kill her,
you will not have God to blame
only yourself.
He ends the say
Look. Severak ...
We've come a long way, Behmen.
Crossed oceans , deserts of ...
Seen things a few men have seen
When this is over,
I think I like see the valley where I was born.
And you?
I have no such yearnings for home.
Ohh ...Then come with me.
I will show you my home and we will sit in the hall
where my forefathers sat and a drink ale .
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell
A fewer still will believe!
Either we'll know the truth,
my friend. We'll know, ...
Hello!
Is anyone there?
- Where are the monks?
- The chapel.
At this time , they should be in vespers.
My brothers, forgive the intrusion,
But we have travelled far.
It cann't be!
He would not abandon us.
God would not abandon us.
We must go,
There is no hope here. Only the plague ...
Go where ?
these men were our hope
We are in God's hands now
Prayer is our only salvation.
- Our Lord in heaven, Hallowed be thy name ...
- Debelzaq!
- Thy kingdom come, They will be done ...
- Debelzaq!
...as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
Get up!
We forgive those how trespass against us
Get up!
And lead us nary to temptation
But deliver us from evil ..
Debelzaq ...
.....
the Key of Solomon
book of which the cardinal spoke.
Within this pages is saved to be
all the rituals, prayers, and incantations
Used by holy men ,
throughout the ages
To defend against the forces of evil
Can ...
... You perform the ritual?
What have we here?
Is this the fair trial
you promised me, Behmen?
you see with your own fate.
Let it be known to all here present
And before God, himself
That this woman
stands accused of witchcraft,
That she is admitted to call up the plague
against all mankind.
I'm flattered.
But I must confess ...
I have deceived you ...
You think you can save yourself by recanting
But you're wrong
Speak the truth now before God!
The Truth?
Do not talk to me of the truth,
you hypocrite
For centuries you and your ilk
have been burning, hanging, crucifying
Anyone who stood in their way.
In truth, I shall thank you.
The church has sent more souls
to Perdition
than all of the wars, famines
and pestilences is put together.
That's a lie, Witch!
Debelzaq, the ritual!
And you, Behmen?
All you needed was a child to save .
Someone to ease your pitiful guilt
Do you truly think that saving
one racked wave, would change anything?
Come Behmen. Your sins are legend.
How many innocent
have fallen beneath that very blade?
They are godless people, Infidels
They sinned against God and
against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished
How could you know?
This no witch!
This no witch!
Do not utter those words!
We're goanna need more
Holy water .
Here!
Tell me, Behmen ...
Are we going in there to defeat
the demon or to save the girl?
Both.
I have found more holy water.
You've done well.
- This as far as you go, Kay.
- I don't understand ...
This's not your battle.
I took a vow to join your cause.
I Release you from your vow
There's no shame in it.
Honour is not as thing
to be dismissed or forgotten.
A vow must be fulfilled ,
else, there is no vow at all.
- Even are the cost of your life?
- Even then.
Kneel, Kay.
Speak after me.
- Grant me courage Lord ...
- Grant me courage Lord ...
- For I'm thy servant.
- For I'm thy servant.
- And guard me with strength into battle...
- And guard me with strength into battle...
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...
- As dust before the wind.
- As dust before the wind.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Rise a knight.
- Felson.
- What is it?
I know in my heart,
I haven't earned this.
You will ...
The demon could've escaped anytime.
Why did it wait until we reach Severak?
Perhaps escape wasn't it's purpose.
It wants to be here.
Debelzaq, You said
Eckhart tried to free her.
and I will not be a part of this.
- Papa!
- Mila?
and it killed him, and Hagamar too.
He stood in it's way.
We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it
It wanted to come here
from the very beginning.
My God!
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.
He's right. Everything it's done,
has led us here.
Over Here.
Why would a dying monk
do this to himself?
Why would he tie himself to a desk?
It's a passage from Book of Solomon.
Have more over here
And more.
They were copying it.
To spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all the corners of the earth
..... the bias might beyond
It wants the book!
That why the demon deceived us
into believe in the girl was witch.
It knew that a witch will be brought to those
who possess the Book of Solomon.
You've seen what this plague has done ...
If the book would've fall
into the demon's hands,
We would face an endless darkness.
It's our last defence.
I should thank all of you.
You sacrificed so much
to deliver me here
And now you've brought me the book.
Debelzaq ...
Silence!
- Watch out!
- Behmen!
Where are they?
- Who?
- The Monks?
You can weaken it!
you have to keep reading.
The head ...
Cut off their heads!
They're like cockroaches.
Felson
You have no idea how bad cause of book
Cause to me till over the centuries
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.
you'll be buying tonight my friend.
Felson!
Finish it!
Behmen ...
What can I do?
Keep her safe.
God be with you, Felson.
It's strange ...
To owe so much
to someone I've never even knew.
I don't know what to say.
Say what is within your heart.
My name is Anna.
I owe you my life.
God keep you.
will you tell me about them?
I want to know them.
So the plague past
and life returned to the land
There are Many who Say the plague was nothing
but a pestilence that finally broke,
Like the passing of a fever.
They don't know the darkness
that almost was.
The sacrifices made ...
The heroes lost ...
I'll tell their story.
I was there. I know.
