Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation
in which the United States
has been involved.
You men are a credit to that fine heritage,
and I'm sorry to see you go,
but you've served your country well,
and displayed the ability to fight on
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission,
never leaving behind a fallen comrade,
no matter what the odds or the enemy.
America thanks you,
and I wish you luck wherever you go.
And remember - Rangers lead the way.
- Hi, Tricia.
- Hey.
- Hey, Tricia Poe.
- Hello, Dale.
# How do I get through
one night without you
- Hummingbird.
- Hey. Look at you.
I'd take a beatin' half my life
to get a piece of that woman.
- How's my baby?
- She's doin' fine.
Yeah?
What? You're kidding me!
- What?
- Sweetie.
Hey, shh. Can't you see
I'm in the middle of somethin' here?
What? You gonna be Miss Alabama?
Well, that makes your daddy very proud.
Tricia Poe! You little angel, you.
Hey, how about joinin' me and the boys
for a cold one, huh, darlin'?
- No, thanks.
- Who's your Cap'n Huckleberry here?
- You know this gentleman, honey?
- He's a regular.
Yeah, I'm a regular.
Regular hound dog.
This is a special occasion,
and if you don't mind,
I'd like to spend it dancin' with my wife.
Tell you what, Soldier Dick. Why don't you
go buy me and my buddies a round?
When you get back, we'll talk about
letting me play night baseball
with your little blond bitch-kitty here.
Hey, Cameron, no.
It ain't worth it.
Hey.
- Come on, Daddy. Let's dance.
- Chickenshit!
'Cause of pussies like you,
we lost Vietnam, I'll tell ya that.
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.
You know, for a second there,
you were that guy again.
I know it.
Well, I was hopin' maybe the army
would make that guy grow up.
Well... He has.
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.
Come on.
Cameron!
Cameron, get in the car!
Dale! Dale!
Take this, you son of a bitch!
Tricia!
Tricia!
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.
Admit the facts,
enter a plea bargain.
- I will not plead guilty.
- You could get ten years.
Admit to it, you get four.
Serve maybe a year.
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked,
because you can respond
with deadly force.
It is the order of this court that you be
remanded to a federal penitentiary
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than seven to ten years.
Come on. Bring it here. Hey! Hey!
Dearest Tricia. I think of you always.
Your smile. Your laugh.
I'm not angry.
The blame's gotta fall on me.
I am. However. Torn apart
when I think that I won't be there
Cradled in your arms.
And her first smile.
Those pink coconut things
have made me quite popular.
Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.
I showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.
He said. "Thank God
she looks like her mama. "
It's funny. But here I am
in maybe the worst place on earth.
And yet somehow I feel like
the luckiest man alive.
Poe! Poe!
Dear Daddy. I started today
at the Little Sunshine Day-care Center.
My teacher is Miss Gordon.
She is nice.
We go to playtime. And we all have to
hold hands when we walk there.
Dear Casey.
It was so good to read your letter.
I'm glad you like your teacher.
We don't exactly have a playtime like you.
We do go outside. Though.
But normally we don't hold hands.
My wife and I will have
our margaritas on the yacht.
Dear Daddy. Today was
my first day at first grade.
I didn't like it.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
This boy. Scotty Dalton.
Has black teeth and calls me names.
Mama says I have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.
Dear Casey. Hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.
School is very important.
Your mama's right.
Now. Don't you worry
about little Scotty Dalton.
Sometimes you meet people like that.
But don't let 'em get you down.
Dear Daddy.
Are you ever comin' home?
Just a little while longer. And all
the things we missed doin' together.
Dear Hummingbird. Break out
the fine china. Chill the lemonade.
'Cause this boy's comin' home
to his ladies. Comin' home forever.
I just hope I'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.
"My daddy is coming home on July 14th.
"My birthday is July 14th.
I'm going see my daddy
for the first time ever on July 14th."
I can't wait to meet you, honey.
Isn't that the cutest thing you ever heard?
Yeah, man.
Hey, now, what is this?
I can't see my little daughter on her
birthday without bringin' her a gift, can I?
Yeah, man, but that's a bunny rabbit.
That's all right. She'll like it, right?
It's either this or a tube of toothpaste
and two packs of Pall Malls at the canteen.
- Now, that's a present.
- I'll remember that on your birthday.
Yeah, you do that, man.
"It having been made to appear to
the United States Parole Commission
that Cameron Poe
is eligible to be paroled."
Shit, might be a long time before I see
somethin' like that with my name on it.
You'll get your own date someday, Baby-O.
And when you do, you come over
for some barbecue, you hear me?
- I want you to know, Odell...
- Don't be getting all juicy on me.
You know I got your back, right?
You just go out there and get some of
that good life. That's thanks enough for me.
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?
Don't you worry about that, man. God's
got my back. You know what I'm sayin'?
- I'm goin' home, son!
- Get off me.
Step out.
Goodbye. Good night.
The U.S. Marshal Service annually flies
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.
As you know,
today's flight is a special one.
We're populating
Alabama's Feltham Penitentiary,
the newest super-max facility
in the system.
This place was designed to warehouse
the worst of the worst.
Now, most of these guys are lifers,
some on death row.
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.
I gotta be gettin' my shot before we
go gettin' on some airplane, Guard Bishop.
What's your name?
Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.
OK, you're diabetic? All right, your insulin's
on board. We'll give it to you in flight.
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.
You're under full restraints till you're
released from your prison, understand?
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.
- It's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...
and love-starved murderers.
No way.
What you got here is a walking,
talking reason to rehabilitate.
So today let's exemplify
our three operative words -
firm, fair and vigilant.
Now, let's go to work.
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest to Feltham.
Good. Let's go deal with the DEA boys.
- Know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.
This, this is fucking spectacular!
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.
Vince, Duncan Malloy - DEA.
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure we're gonna have
a good time working on this together.
Hey, Willie. How ya doin'?
You know each other?
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA.
The file on Francisco Cindino,
son of Eduardo,
prime mover of narcotics from Colombia.
It's gonna be an all-star flight.
This kid's a font of information
about the family business.
- 11 ½ OK?
- Yeah.
Look at him. Nice college boy, right?
We interrogated him, he gave up nothing.
This is our last chance
before the FBI gets him.
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.
We pick up Mr. Cindino in Carson City.
Till the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.
You'll sit next to him. He's known to be
garrulous in the company of thieves.
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?
- What's with dictionary boy here?
- Thesaurus boy is more appropriate.
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.
- Yeah, so do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.
I've got a small arsenal in the belly of
the plane, a pistol in the cockpit lock box.
That's it. Other than that,
we keep the plane like a prison.
No weapons on the aircraft, period.
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.
Then your man doesn't get on the plane.
OK, Willie, give it to him.
Give him the gun.
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.
- In the pen it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.
OK.
Foxtrot Charlie.
We are ready to disembark.
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.
That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam."
- The mass murderer?
- The same.
He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.
Killed her parents,
brothers, sisters and dog.
Scan him.
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?
Nathan Jones, aka "Diamond Dog."
Former general of the Black Guerrillas.
He blew up a meeting of
the National Rifle Association, saying:
"They represented the basest negativity
of the white race."
He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections in a Diamond Eye.
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community."
They're talking to Denzel for the movie.
Close door number one.
This one's done it all -
kidnapping, robbery, murder, extortion.
Foxtrot Charlie. Perimeter is secure.
You are clear to release.
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus."
spent in our institutions.
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.
Likes to brag that
he killed more men than cancer.
OK, open wide.
Lift your tongue.
Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally
insane. He's a true product of the system.
What's that supposed to mean?
What is he, one of these sociology majors
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?
No, but I could point a few fingers
if you'd feel comfortable.
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.
Man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.
He told me he loved me.
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.
OK, let's do it.
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.
Tell me, Skip,
is the U.S. Marshal Service
in the habit of employing annoying,
wise-ass bookworm creeps?
Larkin's one of the best we got.
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.
Scan him. Face me.
- What's this shit?
- It's my daughter.
I don't care if it's the weepin' mama
of Christ. No personal possessions.
Just as long as you know
I'll get that back at some point.
Are you tellin' me what
I'm gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, break it up.
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.
What you got in your pocket?
- Just my dick, Officer.
- Get on the plane.
- Right here.
-  Attention. Officers.
Sweet bird of freedom.
What's up, man? Pinball Parker.
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend.
Angry, angry nigga, man.
Aw, shucks.
- All right, face me.
- I got him.
Come on.
Open.
You guys are late for the party.
- OK.
- Let's go, sweetheart.
What's up, Cochise?
How.
I'm just fuckin' with you. Don't get all
Wounded Knee on me and shit.
You look like you wanna scalp a nigga.
What you lookin' at, punk?
Nothin'. I was just admirin' your cage.
Fits you pretty good.
Well, welcome aboard.
My, my. As I look around,
I see a lot of celebrities among us.
I see 11 Current Affairs, two Hard Copys,
and a genuine Geraldo interviewee.
But I gotta tell you,
none of this impresses me.
We have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.
It's like kindergarten. Keep your hands
to yourself, keep the decibel level down.
And if any of you
should feel the need to scream,
spit or bite, you get the treatment.
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.
These rules will be enforced.
If there's a hint of trouble,
if any of you so much as
passes gas in my direction,
it offends my delicate nasal passages,
your testicles will become
my personal property.
That's pretty clear. Good.
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.
Nah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.
Anyway, I despise rapists.
You're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff
that accumulates at the corner in
your mouth when you're really thirsty.
But in your case, I'll make an exception.
- Guard Falzon.
- What?
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?
Well, I think you'll like it, Cyrus.
It's I'll Never Make Love
to a Woman on the Beach Again.
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Steak For Me Ever.
Funny fucker, aren't ya?
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.
The only thing we gotta worry about
is stale peanuts and a little turbulence.
Close forward gate.
Close middle gate.
- Come on, I need my shot!
- Coming. I'm coming. Left arm.
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right,
hope you don't hold a grudge.
What the fuck are you doin'?
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker, man?
He spontaneously combusted.
He's a fuckin' witch doctor.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.
- I've got a fire.
- Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.
At first I thought he was singin' "YMCA."
Then the flames.
Shit!
Yeah!
Holy shit! Hold on, Bobby!
Gimme a Taser!
Hey, man, get off my insulin!
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddam door!
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!
Pinball, behind you!
Get the gun out of the lock box, Mack.
Go on back there, check it out.
Go! Go!
Oh, my God.
Say there was a disturbance
but it's under control.
Say it, or I will kill you.
Without me,
you got nobody to fly the plane.
I never think that far ahead.
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.
And if you say a word about this
over the radio,
the next wings you see will belong to
the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse.
Uh, Carson City.
Hey! Hey!
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.
I have the only gun on board.
Welcome to Con Air.
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.
Calm down. A little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.
- Just a little ruckus?
- Pilot just checked in. Everything's fine.
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.
Damn, this pig is heavy!
Oops.
Shit.
If we let you out,
you gonna play nice?
Probably not.
I got a spot on my arm just for you.
- Hey, man. Get off my medication.
- I'm sorry, man. The shit's in my way.
I'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.
All right, man. Stop rushin'.
Ah, yeah.
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.
Keep that in mind when you look at her.
If your dick jumps out of your pants,
you jump out of this plane.
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.
Well, I know three of these brothers.
They right back there.
Uh, the other three
are Benson, Carls and Popovitch.
Where are they?
That's a damn good question,
and I'll find out.
The pilot wants to know what's next.
He's to land at Carson City Airport
as scheduled.
Carson City? The law is down there.
You lost your mind?
According to
my last psych evaluation, yes.
Diamond Dog, if you would.
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.
shotguns are waitin' for us at the next stop.
Now, if you do exactly what we tell ya,
the rest of our lives will be
a vacation in a non-extradition country.
I'm talkin' sandy beaches, umbrella drinks,
- and dirty, naked freaks.
-
It'll be a paid motherfuckin' vacation.
- Wait. Who's doin' the payin'?
- Our employer, Francisco Cindino.
Everybody freeze! Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.
Get that ass out here right now!
- With you in a second.
- Right now!
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA, that's who the fuck I am.
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.
You think I give a shit
about that little bitch guard?
Maybe you didn't hear me. I'm DEA.
You know what the fuck that means?
- You the most crooked nigga here.
- Shut up.
DEA? What are you doin' on this flight?
Won't they fly you boys commercially?
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
I swear I'll blow him away right now.
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield,
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.
Suck my dick, Cyrus.
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.
- Stay back!
- Just stop before somebody gets killed.
Back!
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.
- Stay back!
You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?
I can't control it?
I can't control it?
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!
What's your name, convict?
- My name?
- Yeah.
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.
Nice goin', son.
Not only did you not save this dude's life,
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.
Hey, Cyrus, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.
Yeah, what's the good news?
The goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is,
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is Carls,
and this honky he's draggin' in
is Popovitch.
I don't know how to tell you this, Cyrus,
but we are three white guys short,
or as they say in Ebonics,
"We be fucked."
Look, man, I just wanna know.
All right, you didn't... You didn't mean
that dirty-nigger crackhead shit, did you?
Gimme that gun.
Hell, yes, I meant it.
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane
and we'll give 'em exactly what they expect.
So I need three volunteers.
Come on. Let's go, son.
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?
I'm servin' eight consecutive life sentences.
I won't get off this plane.
I got my insulin,
but they broke all the damn needles.
If I don't get my shot soon,
they'll be sending flowers to my mother.
- I'm too old for this shit.
- No offense.
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.
That puts you shit out of luck.
- Come on, man.
- Tell you what. Sit down.
One of my associates
will bring you a phone book,
and you call the Affirmative Action Office.
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.
I'll get off, scream to high heaven.
This plane won't leave Carson City.
We need another white boy to volunteer.
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.
You rang?
Carson City says we got
a hell of a sandstorm down there.
Perfect.
Crazy.
Last tenant, Cyrus Grissom.
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?
Looks like cocaine.
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. It's all soft.
What about the rest of the pigs?
Be patient, now.
They haven't ceased to be useful yet.
OK, old man.
Now you're Mr. Popovitch.
Gentlemen, you'll reach
the Nevada pen in about two hours.
The tape's just a little precaution
in case any of you are rocked by
the sudden impulse to squeal like a pig.
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.
What?
I changed my mind.
So, Cyrus, we got a little mind-changer.
I got 15 years left,
and I know I'd just hate myself
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak
and an umbrella drink.
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.
I know. Fear of freedom, I guess.
- What did you say your name was again?
- Cameron Poe.
Wait. I know that name.
- You're Cameron Poe?
- That's right.
You killed the giant.
That's right.
- The who?
- The giant.
Wallace Wilson.
Big bad brother.
You put him down on the tiles
bare-handed, so they say.
They say right.
Damn, I knew I knew that name, man.
- And why'd you do that?
- He tired to take my black cherry Jello.
And I like black cherry Jello.
You like black cherry Jello?
I like you.
Stand up. Get the cuffs off him.
Pick out a guard, and then put
that dead cop's prison issues on him.
I'm still gonna fuck her.
Then I'm gonna fuck you.
Then I'm gonna fuck your whole family.
OK. For now, just fuck yourself.
- Plane's on final descent to Carson City.
- Right on time.
I'm going to Vacaville. Wanna come?
Nah, paperwork. Any weekend plans?
I don't know. The usual, I guess.
Channel 7's playing all five
Planet of the Apes movies.
I think I'm just gonna get into it.
There's more to life than the smooth
and efficient transfer of federal prisoners.
Yes, there is, Ginny,
but nothing quite as dependable.
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.
It'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.
What would my daughter think of me if I left
you like this to get dishonored and die?
If you act like you're a Ranger,
we'll all be in trouble.
You're not that guy anymore.
You're a convict.
Dear God!
- Told you I'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer.
Now put those on. I just saved your life.
OK, soldier boy.
You got a plan?
Maybe.
Chief?
I got a lot of weird shit down here.
- What is it?
- This looks like the drawing of a plane.
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.
Open up!
My daughter's picture.
Where's my daughter's picture,
you shit-eatin' peckerhead?
Heard you had a problem up there.
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.
On the bus, dickhead!
On the bus!
Let's go. Rack the gate.
They took the plane. You hear that, boys?
We got the plane, man.
Shut the fuck up, Curly, all right?
You gonna get us caught!
No way, Jose! Ah!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Oh, boy.
In Spanish from Bogotá, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.
Orange and black.
What's up, man?
- So, you Swamp Thing?
- That's right.
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.
It's amazing the shit you white trash know.
That's right.
Shit! Aw, man!
What are you doin' here?
Hello. How you doin', baby?
I'm just tryin' to get out of the storm,
you know. Grab my lunch.
Well, this is a restricted area,
and you're not allowed in here.
That must mean we're alone
if it's restricted, baby.
Just chill for a minute.
It's all right. I'm a cop.
You work for a prison or somethin'?
Yeah, the Department of Erect...
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.
Creepy.
The eyes are cut out of their heads.
- Is that it?
- One more.
Late addition.
- Who?
- Garland Greene.
Should be interesting.
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.
Christ in a cartoon!
- Shit, that's Garland Greene, man.
- The Marietta Mangler.
That skinny little man
butchered 30-somethin' people
up and down the Eastern seaboard.
They say the way
he killed those people
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge Family.
Well, he's on the right flight.
You really do need to leave...
You've got the prettiest eyes
I've seen in about five to ten.
- Well, thank you so much.
- I really mean that.
- We've got tours...
- I'm Pinball.
- Nice to meet you, Pinball.
- Oh, look at them hands.
Met ca... Me... Me.
Et cetera.
Cetera. Meet.
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?
"Carson...
City."
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.
What you doin'? Just leave it alone.
He told you not to touch anything.
What the hell?
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.
Come on.
We've got a situation here, sir.
Somebody better call the marshal's office.
Code red!
Starkey. Those ain't guards.
- They're cons. Stall 'em.
- Christ!
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?
Won't be long now.
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!
Did you hear somethin'
that sounded like a fuckin' plane?
Jailbird One. You are not
cleared for takeoff.
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!"
Thank you. I'm here all week.
Hey! Hey, Cochise, it's me!
Pinball. I'm sorry. Hey!
Shine, sweet freedom, shine!
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?
Oh, yeah. It's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.
Swamp, where is the transponder?
Are you sure it's safe to fly in this?
No problem.
I've done this a thousand times.
We'll be through this in a few minutes.
You all right back there, ladies?
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.
What the fuck happened?
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?
Duncan, they killed him.
They got the plane.
I knew that guy for six years.
I trained him.
I put him on that plane.
Now what?
Tell me, Skip, what kind of a Keystone
Kops operation are you guys runnin' here?
And you, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!
Hey, he brought a gun on the plane.
If I knew how you run things,
I'd have told him bring a fuckin' Uzi!
No one carries on these flights!
No one! He brought a gun
and he got himself killed.
And he compromised
the safety of my men!
Your men are incompetent!
They let themselves get taken over
by a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!
- I'm not gonna listen to this shit!
- Guys, guys. Let's work it out.
OK. OK.
So, what do we do now?
What's the plan?
You do have a plan, don't you?
We're workin' on it.
Contingency plans
for something like this don't exist.
- It's never been contemplated.
- Start contemplating,
'cause this is a situation
that needs to get unfucked right now!
I want a chopper. Make that a few of 'em.
They need to be armed.
I don't care if it's National Guard,
Air Force, whatever.
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know,
but this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.
- You sure?
- Love your work.
They're headed southeast toward Arizona.
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?
That's too bad. I liked Pinball.
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.
Why you care?
I got just as much ridin' on this as you.
We're all convicts here.
Cyrus Grissom. Do you copy?
Cyrus Grissom, do you copy?
Yes, I copy. Identify yourself.
This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.
Oh, Agent Malloy.
I'm so sorry about your associate.
Nothing is quite as sad
as seeing a grown man pissing his pants.
Grissom, you puny, fucking animal!
When I get through with you,
you'll beg for the electric chair.
Hey, I don't like him.
If he speaks again,
this conversation is terminated.
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.
- He's leaving the building, OK?
- Good, then I'll talk to you.
Here are the rules. First I ask
a question, then you ask a question.
OK. What's your question?
In Carson City,
your bulls were onto us. How?
- One of the guards...
- Shh.
- One of the guards...
- One of the guards
faked a heart attack and we had to
remove his restraints.
All right?
I see. And what's your question?
Where you goin' with my plane, Cyrus?
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.
So are you, Vince.
# Oh, nothin' makes me sadder than
# The agent lost his bladder in the airplane
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.
resembling authority. So now you know.
Your attention. Please.
Flight 475...
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.
My name's Grant,
US Marshal Service.
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.
Your presence is requested.
I have a jet standing by.
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?
What was I thinking about?
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.
I was just wonderin' what a black militant -
that would be you -
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.
- Don't you think that's strange?
- It's a means to an end, my white friend.
A means to an end. See...
I's can play house nigger
tills we get to where we're goin'.
And then the day of the Dog begins.
So what was that all about?
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane,
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over,
and then somehow managed to
stick us right smack in the middle.
Hi, Garland.
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.
US Ranger, highly decorated. A little
hell-raising, but nothing serious.
Explain to me why any of this matters.
Fact one - we got a plane filled with killers,
rapists and thieves and Cameron Poe -
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef,
non-gang affiliated.
He's a parolee hitchin' a ride home.
Fact two - Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.
Doesn't do it. Why?
Fact three - our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe
planted Sims' tape recorder on him.
These are interesting facts.
You do the math on this,
and we got an ally on that plane.
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.
- Could have happened to any one of us.
- I am not one of these animals.
That's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.
"The degree of civilization in a society
can be judged by observing its prisoners."
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom said that after
putting a bullet in my agent's head, OK?
The issue here is
how the plane is brought down.
Shoot it down.
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.
I am authorized to bring
Agent Sims' killers to justice using,
- and I quote, "All necessary means."
- Not including shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
- Is that right.
- You're not seriously entertaining this.
- This is a drastic situation we got.
- Those are our men up there!
- All of whom signed a no-hostage clause.
Who are you to decide the value of
a man's life? They're innocent people!
-
- About time.
- For what? About time for what?
- Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.
Goddamn it! Skip, don't do this!
He's in an irrational state of mind!
His head isn't on straight.
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.
Gentlemen, in roughly five hours, we will
be flying over the shores of Mexico,
but first we have to change aircraft.
Thank you, and have a pleasant flight.
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes.
The only problem is, we're not doing
We're draggin', baby. The landing gear
ain't all the way up. We're gonna be late.
- No, Cyrus, that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.
- What the hell I know about landing gear?
- Learn.
How are you doing there, Sally Bishop?
Living out my fantasies, Poe.
Hm. I'll bet.
- You got a family?
- Got a cat.
Had a husband, but he didn't like the cat,
so something had to give.
Sounds like a tough choice.
In five years my cat never once got drunk
and embarrassed me in front of my friends.
In six years my husband never
purred when I touched him,
so it wasn't a tough choice at all.
I sure could use one of them
pink snowballs right about now.
Hillbilly!
Poe.
Yeah?
Cyrus wants you
to check out the landing gear.
Then I'll get to see some nice scenery
whippin' by down there.
Trees and stuff.
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.
Cut him loose. He's slowin' us down.
Dead weight.
Not exactly a proper burial.
Look at our shit over there.
Hurry up.
Hillbilly.
Gotcha.
Hurry up, man.
Bye, Pinball.
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?
Every time I get her waxed, I get ten feet
from the car wash and then, pow, bird shit.
Well, it's supposed to be good luck.
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.
- You were in the Q, right?
- Yeah.
And I heard you say you had 15 years.
That's right.
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?
Yeah.
Yeah. Funny thing.
I was on north block.
- I don't know you.
- Well, you know what, pal?
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly-shit.
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block
and I didn't want to know 159 of them,
which included you.
- What do you think about that?
- Yeah.
He's a font of misplaced rage.
Name your cliché. Mother held him
too much, or not enough.
Last picked at kickball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.
Now he's so angry, moments of levity
actually cause him pain.
Gives him headaches.
Happiness, for that gentleman, hurts.
What's wrong with him?
My first thought would be... a lot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.
Nice to meet ya.
This must be Casey.
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.
Nice to meet ya.
So how are you doin'?
I'm sorry. Scratch that.
Dumb question.
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.
Maybe you could tell me
exactly what's going on here.
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.
Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you.
Hey, wait. Where'd you get the rims, man?
Our personal shit's down in the belly.
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.
Men!
It seems that your husband, Cameron,
had an opportunity to get off the plane
and didn't,
and I was hoping you could
maybe help me figure out why.
That would make two of us.
I don't know.
I mean, it's possible... it's not uncommon
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.
A certain degree
of institutionalization sets in.
Fear of coming home,
living in society...
- Any of this make sense?
- No, no.
That's not Cameron. I mean,
if you knew him, if you read his letters,
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that...
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna...
I mean, look, he's got this little girl
to come home to.
Wouldn't you...
do the same thing?
There'd have to be a pretty strong reason
to keep me on that plane.
Knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.
Maybe, if you do see him
or if you talk to him,
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?
Be kinda nice to have him around.
- You got it.
-
Vince, line one.
This body fell out of the sky.
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.
- We got a problem here with a corpse.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, it fell out of the sky.
I don't think he's an astronaut.
Then what's this got to do with me?
It's got your name written all over it.
Last transponder tag was in Arizona.
Body falls here in Fresno.
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.
- Get me Chief...
- Devers.
Please. Thank you.
- Vince?
- Turn around.
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield.
It's 100 miles from here.
Horseshit! We're tailing
the transponder tag into Arizona.
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.
- Vince, please, son. We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!
It was to me!
The note on the body was to me!
- You're chasing the wrong...
- Aw, shut up.
Hello?
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.
I gotta get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.
Got a fast car, you can drive it.
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.
Send what you got - sheriff, state trooper,
National Guard. Hold on one minute.
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.
It's a matter of time
before they find the weapons.
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.
How do you think I got the number?
"...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that..."
Poe.
Man! Oh, yeah!
Put the bunny back in the box.
I knew you was a punk,
and I was right.
You been playin' us all along.
You a free man.
I said, put the bunny back in the box.
Die, punk!
Why couldn't you
put the bunny back in the box?
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Redwall cliffs.
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.
Holy shit!
Abort! Abort! Abort!
If that aircraft's carrying
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."
Shit!
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!
We need to get to Lerner Airfield now!
Get me Vince Larkin.
Two went down, one came up.
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.
Most murders are crimes of necessity
rather than desire.
But the great ones -
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy -
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you...
I got nothing in common with them,
with you. Don't you talk to me!
- They were insane.
- Now you're talking semantics.
What if I told you insane was working 50
hours a week in some office for 50 years,
at the end of which they tell you to piss off?
Ending up in some retirement village,
hoping to die before suffering the indignity
of trying to make it to the toilet on time.
Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane.
One girl... I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.
It's my daughter's birthday today,
so please feel free
not to share everything with me.
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crank the knuckles and hit the crystals.
We're putting this baby down
in the sandbox.
Lerner Tower, do you copy?
Oh, my God.
Look out!
We got it!
Stick her in the cage.
We don't want any distractions.
Feel better now?
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.
Thank you for choosing Con Air.
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.
The last guy who said to have patience -
I burned him down and bagged his ashes.
Cyrus, it'll be here.
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!
I hope he likes sand.
Muchacho. Check out the tower.
Have a look-see, yeah?
- All right.
- You come with us.
How glamorous.
This place is perfect for me.
- Nice landing. Very smooth, honey.
- Fuck you. We made it, didn't we?
- We're gettin' off.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on!
- You shouldn't move him.
- I'm getting him off of this plane.
- You can't move him.
He's too far along.
He could go into shock.
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.
I'm not leaving without you, or you.
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck, or hit the fence.
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.
Just go.
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.
Fuck.
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.
# Swing low, sweet chariot
# Comin' for to carry me home
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?
- It's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.
I can't think of a thing I'd like better
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?
I mean, I don't know him that well myself.
Just what I read.
He firebombed that senator's yacht
with two of his own cousins on board.
So what's your point?
Why not kill some hired guns once they'd
served his purpose? Think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?
- Poe don't want me to off the pigs.
It's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards,
and my own proclivities are well-known
and often-lamented facts of penal lore.
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.
Cyrus, this is your barbecue, man,
and it tastes good.
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over here,
that if it was my barbecue,
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet in the sky
before I start killin' our only leverage.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high and get laid?
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck this!
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.
Poe's right. We're goin' to Plan B.
Gonna get a refueling truck
and a tractor.
So get back there and dig the plane out.
No.
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
Viking, about time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?
Right.
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.
- Have you found Vince Larkin?
- We're having trouble reaching him, sir.
Of course you're having trouble
reaching him!
He's off saving the rain forest,
or recycling his sandals or some shit.
All right, girls! It's Miller time!
Take yourselves a break. Cigarettes!
We got whiskey!
- Whoa, shit!
- Give me that!
- Want me to break this up?
- No, leave 'em be.
You know how happy they are when they
get somethin' that doesn't belong to 'em.
Holy shit!
Hey!
We got company!
Go get Cyrus.
Yo, Cyrus!
- How long we got till they get here?
- Ten, 12 minutes, tops.
Hi, what's your name?
Nice jet.
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.
Freeze!
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?
Uh-huh. In a minute.
Listen, Poe, can I lower this?
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?
Sorry, boss,
but there's only two men I trust.
One of them's me.
The other's not you.
- Cindino was running a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.
If you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust?
- That was a joke.
- I'm glad you told me.
Now I gotta get back to the plane.
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.
You got a friend on board?
See, I knew I was right about you.
I read your file.
You're not a bad guy. Just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
Goodbye, Larkin.
I spoke to your wife.
- In person?
- In person.
And your little girl.
You saw Casey?
Uh-huh.
If this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter won't understand.
If you talk to my wife again,
you tell her... I love her.
She's my hummingbird.
But I couldn't leave a fallen man behind.
You'll do that for me, won't you, Larkin?
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?
What do you think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna save the fuckin' day.
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.
I want this airplane out now.
Come on, men!
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?
Are you sick?
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?
There is no medicine for what I have.
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?
Yes, I do.
# He's got the whole world in his hands
# He's got the whole wide world
Come on.
# He's got the whole world
in his hands
# He's got the whole wide world
in his hands
# He's got the whole world in his hands
# He's got the whole world in his hands
It's on the ground. The plane is on
the ground, but it won't be for long.
- Where the hell are ya?
- We're westbound near the Lerner cutoff.
Where's Cindino?
That's my fuckin' plane!
Cyrus, help me.
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were coming to get you.
Please.
- Cy...
...onara.
No!
- Don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.
- Listen, I need a syringe.
- Oh, no! Drugs'll end you, son.
Is there a first-aid kit around here?
There might be one
in the fire truck over on the boneyard.
All right, thanks.
You just stay here and don't panic.
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.
This is our plane.
- What's that?
- That's a rock.
OK.
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.
Initially, we take out the first car,
then we take out the last,
creating a trap, an airtight cage,
filled with lots and lots of dead people.
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?
Bring me those propane tanks.
Let's go. Get 'em in there.
If they give you any trouble, kill 'em.
- What can I do?
- Christ, I love a tough woman.
Here, take this.
Go into the boneyard.
If anybody gets through,
scratch their eyes out.
You got it.
Come on, little piggy.
Closer. Closer. Closer.
Voila.
Christ. They'll be slaughtered.
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!
Now.
Come on, you stinking piece-of-shit car!
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?
Well, Baby-O, it's not exactly
mai tais and Yahtzee out here.
Let's do it!
You're gonna see
what happens now, bitch!
Bishop.
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm gonna bust your ass!
Get behind the truck!
Get behind the truck!
When you wake up, Bishop,
I'll be Johnny 24.
You wanna fight somebody?
Don't treat women like that!
Aw, shit!
Whoa! Whoa!
Get back to the plane!
Oh, my God!
OK!
You might better get yourself a seat now.
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.
We're tied up!
- Now, come on!
- OK, I'm comin'.
- Go for the tires!
- Fuck the tires! I'm goin' for the pilot!
- Isn't that your car, Malloy?
- Couldn't be. I left mine at the office.
On any other day,
that might seem strange.
Gotta get her nose up!
Fuckers! Come on!
When this is over,
so are you, you little prick!
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye!
Go, girl!
All right!
Define irony.
Bunch of idiots dancing on a plane
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.
# In Birmingham they love the governor.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh
# Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Someone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.
Someone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.
Someone even killed poor Billy Bedlam.
Now, could this all be coincidence?
Perhaps.
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.
So I ask you, what is going on?
And I answer -
we have a traitor in our midst.
Now, how do we flush a traitor?
I don't know,
but at the count of three,
I will find out who is on my team
and who is not.
That would be one, two...
Wait! It was me.
It was me.
Don't listen to him, man.
The insulin made him crazy.
You have been near death
the entire trip?
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's flipped out. He's nuts.
It's pretty clever, huh, bitch?
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!
"My daddy
is coming home on July 14th.
"My birthday is July 14th.
I'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever on July 14th."
Make a move, and the bunny gets it.
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!
Fire!
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!
You got it, Agent Malloy?
You with me?
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?
I got a bad feeling, son.
I feel like maybe
I'm not supposed to make it.
You're gonna make it.
You just think about that barbecue.
Cyrus Grissom, this is
Special Agent Vince Larkin.
We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.
All I can think about is, like,
there ain't no God.
Like, he don't exist.
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I'm gonna show you God does exist.
Fire!
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!
Yes!
Freeze, little bitch boy!
- Switch to missile.
- Roger that, two. Arming missiles.
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.
Shit.
What the hell are you doing, Larkin?
- We got no move, sir.
- Stupid bastard.
Oh!
Poe!
Land this thing.
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- I'm the new captain. Put this thing down.
Target locked.
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't fire.
- Who is this?
- Identify yourself.
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes.
Poe!
Poe!
I repeat, target is locked.
- He's got the plane.
- They're not over civilian population.
Now's the time, sir.
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him, he's a friend.
He's just trying to get home
to see his wife and kid. Don't fire.
Now's the time, sir.
- Hold fire.
- Sir?
- I said hold fire!
- Thank you.
- Poe!
- Cyrus!
What?!
All right, Poe. The Las Vegas airport -
it's just past the Strip. Can you see it?
- Well, viva Las Vegas.
- It's right there, man. You can make it.
All the runways are cleared.
Come on, do it, Poe.
- Put this thing down.
- Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit,
zero fuel and we're dropping too fast.
The Strip's where I'm gonna land.
Only the word is...
crash.
Should've shot them down
over the open desert, Larkin.
The civilian casualties will be enormous.
Strap in, ladies.
We're going for a night out in Vegas.
# He's got the whole world in his hands
# He's got the whole world in his hands,
He's got the whole...
Shut up, you freak!
We're gonna die!
- Can't he make it to the airport?
-  No way. Sir.
All right, we'll need police cars,
fire engines, emergency service vehicles.
Anybody who knows CPR.
Oh, this is beautiful!
My God, Cyrus!
#... in his hands
#... little bitty baby
Cyrus, wake up!
Stay with me.
The driver of the white
Corvette move your car. Or it'll be towed.
We are shit out of road!
I'm outta here!
Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know
the last thing that little Casey Poe ever
gets to smell will be my stinking breath.
Freeze! OK, lady, hold it right there.
Oh...
How am I doing, son?
You're doing fine.
We just gotta get you a doctor.
I'll get one.
You know I'm still coming
to that barbecue, right?
Of course you are.
You did real good, Ranger man.
You did real good.
Ow!
Check you out at the hospital, son.
You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.
So what are you gonna do now?
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.
- Thank you.
- You take care, Sally Bishop.
Hey, Poe.
Next time, take the bus.
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.
Come get it! Come on now!
- That gun work?
- Yeah.
Well, shoot that piece of shit!
- What the hell is that?
- You pull over.
Yeah, sure. How about this?
You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.
Just so's you know, Marshal Larkin,
there's now three men I trust.
Am I one of 'em?
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.
- You OK?
- No.
Good. I'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.
Listen, I...
I wanna apologize about the car.
I know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.
- I was bored with that car anyway.
- It worked out nicely then.
# How do I get through
one night without you
# If I had to live without you
what kind of life would that be?
# I need you in my arms.
Need you to hold
Hello, Cameron.
Hello, Hummingbird.
I meant to get a haircut.
I got a present for ya, Casey.
A little dirty.
Casey, sweetie,
take your daddy's present now.
No, no, no, honey. It's OK.
I got a picture... a picture of you.
I got a picture of you, too.
Happy birthday, darlin'.
# How do I live without you?
I want to know
New shooter comin' out, new shooter.
Does the new shooter feel lucky?
Well, does he?
Yes. Yes, he does.
