Hey, little one. Yeah.
Hey.
Here, let me hold him.
Inspector, sign this.
Call the Police and have them send
someone to pick up, Crazy Kung.
Yes, sir.
We'll have to keep these boys separate.
I can't tell which is which.
You shouldn't say that, honey,
besides we never want them to be apart.
Now, do we.
Hey!
Take cover!
Oh, my little man.
Give me that baby!
What's going on?!
No! Wait please!
You'll never take me alive!
Give me back my baby!
Bitch!
Give me back my baby!
Freeze!
I should shoot you for
what you did to that baby.
Oop.
Hi, there little fella.
Want a drink?
Huh? Well, I do.
All we found was,
an empty wheelchair.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, what a sweet thing.
We didn't know you were pregnant?
Let me hug him. So lovely!
Hi, yes!
Hey, Boomer!
Where's our money?
Get him!
Huh?
Strange
Quit it!
Huh? Hi!
He grabbed me.
What? You come here!
Boomer, he was going to hit me.
Fight him back!
Huh? Right.
I'll get you, you little prick!
There he is!
Get him!
Thank you.
Aaa... choo!
Aah... choo!
Oh, Happy Birthday son.
I love you baby.
Ow!
Here are
the pictures.
Hey, Boss.
Remember this one?
Look at that.
You won the last four races,
checkered flag. Nobody could touch you.
Boy, Boss, you're good.
I wouldn't mind these.
No, not a chance.
Nobody like the Boss.
Yeah, burn, baby.
Boomer, come here! Hurry!
I've been waitin' half an hour.
Why do I have to wear this
stupid coat and a shirt and tie?
Why? That's one of them classy joints.
We gotta look respectable, huh?
Got the piece?
Right here.
Well, where we going?
Come on, we're late.
I want you to meet someone.
I got a girl.
A girl?
There she is. Check her out.
She's your babe?
What do you think?
She looks like Maradonna, doesn't she?
Maradonna plays soccer.
You mean Madonna, don't you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
Let's go have a look at her.
Do us the honor.
Boss, go ahead and sing.
Go ahead.
Go ahead Boss, give it a shot.
Excuse me.
No one's allowed in.
There's a private party booked here.
Will you come into my heart...
you'll see...
Lovely lady, I wish you go upstairs.
We will...
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
The song isn't over!
Get your ass back up there!
Boomer!
No one can cross, sir.
No. I'm not leaving!
I have business here!
What are you deaf?
Go and get paid!
Leave her alone. She's done singing.
Who said that?
I did!
You got a problem with that?
Who the hell are you?
My name's Tyson.
Who the hell are you?
That's none of your damn business.
Now, get the hell out of here,
before we kick your ass.
We'll leave when
we're good and ready.
I see.
Get 'em.
Here.
I'm no singer!
Listen, I'm here to protect you.
You sure about that?
He's doing all the work.
Kill the god damn speaker!
Boomer.
Beat it!
Hey wait. She's mine!
You want some of this punk?
Shut up!
Boomer! Help! Save me!
AHH!
Hey!
Boomer, don't forget
about the gun!
Nobody move!
I said, don't move!
Tyson.
Are you alright?
What did you do to my jacket?
I can't believe you did that.
You know how hard I am to fit?
Nobody move.
Nobody move.
Where is she? Where are you?
Ah?!
Don't move, anybody.
Let go. You're hurting me.
I'm sorry, Miss. You all right?
We're here to help you. Don't worry.
That's right.
I could take five of you
with my bare hands..
And shoot seven more
with this gun. With, uh...
No, no, no, no.
I could shoot another six.
Now, which one of you
would like to go first? Huh?
Get out!
You hear that?
Let's go.
Hey, so what about this jacket? Huh?
You think I'm just going
to forget about it?
Come on, give me the gun.
We've made our point. Let's go.
No, we haven't.
What, are you trying to embarrass me?
This gun's a fake.
Give me the damn gun.
Tell you what.
Your wallet, and we call it even.
Huh? Wha...
Where'd you get this thing?
It's the best I could do, run!
Get her!
Get the girl! Come on!
Don't let her get away!
Hey!
You.
Okay!
You're mine!
Boomer.
Get him!
Hey, hey, hey, can't handle
me by yourself, huh?
Aren't you a little bit embarrassed?
Boomer!
I'll save you!
Ahh!
Who do you think you are?
Huh?
Hey, tough guy, careful not to
get blood on your suit.
Will.
Hey, Will.
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?
Huh?
Oh, no wait. I'm a road racer.
Break my left leg.
I'm gonna need my right one.
Yeah?
That's right, tough guy.
I could beat your ass
any day of the week.
You want to end up like Koo, with his
guts spilled all over the sidewalk?
Koo was a loser anyway..
On the Prince Edward Road Circuit, he
couldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole.
What do you know about racing?
My name's Boomer, and I'm the
best damn driver in Hong Kong.
You wanna bet on that?
For 3,000, you're on.
Three hundred thousand.
Well, those are
pretty small potatoes.
Three hundred thousand?
Get your car together and
meet us tomorrow.
At Ferry Pier.
Three o'clock.
I'll be a little richer, and
you'll have another day to live.
Come on, start, you son of a bitch!
How can you race that guy?
You can't even start your car.
Who's that?
You aren't leaving me, are you?
Uh, hi.
Please get in.
Thanks.
I appreciate all your help.
I just started working here last week.
That gangster's been
bugging me every night.
If you didn't show up,
I would have been in trouble.
What's your name?
Boomer.
Oh, I see.
And you?
Tyson.
Ah.
You don't know who he is?
Not really.
You told me
she was your girl.
Uh, well, she is sort of.
I'm working on it.
How dare you?
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
Wait.
Leave me alone.
Boomer!
Boomer!
We've been friends forever.
You can't let a little thing
like this come between us.
Look, we've been
to hell and back together,
but you have to get a grip
on reality.
How could she be interested in you?
You two have nothing in common.
Look at her hair.
I don't know..
I think I got a shot. Don't you?
You're driving me crazy!
I didn't like that job anyway.
Uh, what's your name again?
Barbara.
Uh, Barbara, that's right.
Do you think you can
tell the big hero over there..
If you might be
interested in him?
Just between us,
you see...
he's never had a girlfriend.
It was nice meeting you.
You have a good time.
I'm going home now.
I'm sorry, Boomer.
Excuse me Mister Ma, is this
your first visit to Hong Kong?
Yes.
Well, we certainly look forward
to your concert, sir.
Three hundred thousand.
This is the last time.
Come on, I need a car.
Look, last time
you were three hours late.
You sure didn't complain
when I gave you $400.
Are you backing down on our deal?
You scratched the last one up.
They almost found me out.
That's $600 you owe me.
Hmm.
Hey!
Careful.
They might be watching us now.
This is the last time.
I never wanna see you guys again.
Step on it!
Yeah!
I'll be back in a second.
Hey, wait up. Where the
hell you think you're going?
I gotta take a leak.
Hurry back.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, you think
you own the damn road?
Pardon me.
Here we are, Maestro.
Uh-huh.
Oh, bellman!
Heh, heh.
You out did yourself.
Nice choice too.
My favorite color.
You are  man.
Let's take a ride. Get in!
Hey!
Sorry, kid, I really don't know
what you're talking about.
Quit fooling around, huh?
Hey, Tyson.
What are you doing down there?
Huh?
You and your stupid jokes. Take that!
It's not funny!
Hey!
Rolling me on the ground like that!
Hey!
I'm so sorry.
Good morning, sir.
Welcome.
Yes.
This way...
Not 100...
Ah, there you are, John!
I remember you!
Still well?
I'm good. We haven't seen
each other in a long time.
Oh, come on over here.
Look. Do you recognize her?
She's the same girl you used
to play with, when you were a kid.
Tammy, go on and say " hello " to John.
Go on!
Oh, come on, a nice, big kiss.
That's better.
She finished her training
as a nurse.
When she heard you were coming, she
quit her job, just to take care of you.
That's nice,
but I feel fine.
Now, John, there are a lot of diseases
in this part of the world.
You're a world famous conductor. You
really can't afford to catch anything.
It would be terrible, if you did.
Please, I would like
to freshen up first.
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
We'll talk later, huh?
Oh, Tammy, will you show
some interest?
Daddy, I already have a boyfriend.
I'm helping you get a husband,
not a boyfriend.
What about Rocky?
Who? Stallone?
Not Stallone. Frankie Lok.
I call him Rocky.
Even Rocky would tell you to go for it.
Now, take this medicine bag.
Your daddy's very serious about this.
I want you and John to hit it off.
We'll have a merger with the Ma family,
and both our businesses will prosper.
And we'll be one big, happy corporation...
I mean, family.
It's a very tough business world
we live in, my dear..
John, are you there?
My daughter's here to see you.
Now, you remember. Be nice to him.
Daddy, daddy.
Go on, get in there.
Oh, God, I hope it works.
Here, let me help you with this.
So many bottles.
I thought your father was kidding.
I didn't know nurses were so sexy
these days. You're showing.
No, up here.
Oh!
Even when I was a child,
I hardly needed vitamins or medicine.
If I had known, I wouldn't
have brought so many.
Come on, sit over here.
Thank you.
Your dress is a bit tight.
Must restrict the circulation.
And your posture's not too good.
That's probably why you often
get a sore back. Am I right?
How'd you know that?
Hmm, come with me.
Lie down, please.
So soon?
Oh. Oh!
Don't worry. No need to rush.
We'll go slowly.
Oh!
Ooh!
Put your leg up here.
Just relax.
I'm almost done.
Wouldn't it be easier
with my clothes off?
No need to.
I'm just loosening you up.
It improves
the circulation.
Are we ready yet?
Feels pretty good,
don't you think?
Asleep already?
You must be very tired.
I can't believe just because
we don't have the $300,000,
we have to run away
to China.
That's a real joke.
Hey, I didn't drive that bad.
I mean, so we came in second.
I mean, what's so wrong with that?
Did we win anything for it?
Not really.
Oh, hey, here. Hold this
for me for a second, will ya?
Oh, my back.
Hi, I slept so well after that
workout you gave me last night.
Would you like to see a menu?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go! I ain't got all day.
I'm busy. Talk to him.
What's he saying?
I'm out of breath. Talk to him.
Where's my money, huh?
Tyson, give him the money.
You got the money.
No, you have it.
Oh, right.
Wait. I'll give you half now...
What are you doing?
Listen here. I know the boat's stolen.
I hope you can appreciate it.
Uh, huh. Call me when you get
to the mainland.
Do you remember Barbara's last name?
Barbara Whatchamacallit.
You fueled the tank,
didn't you?
Oh, yeah!
Tyson, I think we've
been double-crossed.
What, there's no boat?
I mean it's a farewell party.
That wasn't necessary.
Stop reading! Over there!
Let's get out of here.
I left my phone book. I have to get it.
Forget the stupid phone book.
Untie the rope!
Stop those two idiots!
Hurry up, will ya?
Come on, come on.
Go!
Stop right there!
Where the hell do you think
you're going?
You're not going anywhere.
What are we gonna do now?
There's no way out.
We should just go ashore.
Either way we're going to die.
What?
Let's go!
Stop that boat!
Stop it!
You know,
maybe you should let me drive.
Tyson, Quick! Put on your
life-jacket and shut up!
There, that's it.
That's it.
Go! Come on!
Yes! Let's go
meet them at the docks.
You better sit down!
You're gonna fall out!
What's the matter?
Must be the chair.
I feel like I'm on a boat.
I've been feeling seasick
ever since I got here.
I don't know. Maybe it's jet lag.
I feel like I'm...
My father said
you should use his car.
He said it'd be more
convenient for you.
Here...
take it.
Thank you. It's very kind,
but I don't know the roads.
If you get lost, just call me.
These chairs are springy, aren't they?
What are you trying to do?
Oh!
Ohh! Oh!
Oh!
I want them, now!
Tyson! You okay?!
Over there!
Get closer!
Take that!... And that!
Boomer, check this out.
Will you quit fooling around?
Look out over there!
Oh, God!
Tyson!
Come on, he's ours.
Stop him, now! Will!
Let's get 'em.
All right.
Oh, hurry.
I think I'm dying.
We're almost there.
Hang on!
I'll make them pay.
Boomer, Boomer, I'm not dead.
You can come back now.
Ahh!
Help me. I can't drive this.
Hurry!
Turn, turn! Look in front of you!
Get out of the way!
Help!...
That was close.
Tyson!
Well done. Okay.
Hey!
Moron!
Watch where you're going!
Yeah, tell him that.
Whoa!!
You okay, boss?
You want trays?
He started throwing water.
Check please.
We're back on shore now.
I'm sorry about that.
Come on.
Why don't you go change
and we'll go somewhere else?
No, thank you. I'm afraid we'll
go on another boat ride.
Thank you!
Tyson... Tyson...
It's me.
Boomer, is this the mainland?
We made it, didn't we?
Actually, we're still in Hong Kong.
You're lucky, you know.
You got away with just
a few bumps and bruises.
You should see what
happened to Boss Wing.
He was totally wiped out.
Enough. Will you please keep quiet.
I can't hear anything.
Hi. Are you a doctor?
What?
Are you a doctor?
Are you blind?
What else would I be?
Eat slowly.
It's very hot.
You know,
you guys piss me off.
For your information,
this hospital pays us
protection money.
That means
you're in deep shit, punk.
Tyson, we're changing hospitals.
All right.
Hey!
If I were you,
I wouldn't try anything stupid,
'cause you can't get out of this one.
You see, I had a job that required
my boss' great driving skills.
And since you put him
out of commission,
and since I know you can handle a car,
I'm offering the job to you.
What is it?
You'll find out soon enough.
Keep your cellular phone on 24 hours
a day. We'll be contacting you.
And if you don't answer, you can
pick up your buddy piece by piece.
All right, men.
I wanna hear the music
and the feeling...
together as one.
Hello?
Tammy, we on for tonight?
Where are you?
Rocky, I'm kind of busy
right now.
You're seeing someone else,
ain't ya?
No, of course I'm not seeing
anyone else. I wouldn't lie to you.
Yeah. Right.
I'll call you in a few days.
I'm working on some business.
Hey, Tammy.
I knew it.
So that's the little twerp
you're going out with instead of me.
Hey!
That's the feeling I'm talking about,
but no chairs. As one.
Is this the guy?
Huh?
Run before he kills you.
Hurry! Come on.
Tyson was always nice to you.
Why don't you go to see him?
He's in a lot of pain,
and you can make his day.
Well, I don't want him
to get the wrong idea.
You can see him as a friend
and settle the rest later.
I don't think I can do that.
Sounds very serious.
If you need anything else...
No?
Two, please.
Yes, of course. Right this way.
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Let's just have lunch, okay?
WAITER:
Uh, I take care of it for you.
Excuse me. Sir, sir?
Would you mind
not leaning on the glass?
You might disturb
the gentleman on the other side.
Excuse me sir,
I've instructed the gentleman...
on the other side not to disturb you.
WAITER:
Hmm?
It's very sweet, you know,
Tyson having a crush on me.
But I'm not gonna be his girlfriend.
People change. Come on.
Who was that huge guy back there?
My... my boyfriend.
Looks more like a gorilla.
I work with him at the health club.
Wait a minute.
I thought you were a nurse.
Look, if you promise to tell him,
then we can stop by.
Sounds fair enough.
Waiter. Check, please.
Okay. Coming.
BARBARA: So that's it.
Let's get out of her.
I'd like to go back soon.
I have a rehearsal.
I hope it's all right.
Your check, sir.
Is it a policy?
We haven't ordered yet.
Oh, sorry.
So...
He's not a bad guy.
Here he comes now.
Oh! You better hide.
Tammy!
Move!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Just get out. Run!
You scum!
Hey, hey! Hold it right there.
You hear me?
Nobody messes around with my girl.
Get back here, you son of a bitch.
Rocky, wait!
Come back here.
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey!
Stand back.
Tammy, I'm gonna show you
what a real man is.
You better run,
or he's gonna kill you.
Now, Tammy!
You look great.
Be right back.
Wait!
What's going on?
Why are you defending me?
I don't even know you.
Tammy!
You better run. I'll hold him for you.
What?
Go on! Run!
What?
You are really hurting
my pride now, Miss.
You forgot your change, Mister.
I don't want it.
Thank you, sir.
Here, you hold her.
Haven't you had enough yet?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. I don't even know you.
So what? I don't care.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Why are you in such a hurry?
You didn't pay the bill?
No, I did not.
Hey, where'd you get that jacket?
Did you steal it?
What are you talking about?
Cut it out.
Wow!
That's a great car.
Cool!
Whose is it?
I can't believe it.
Does it belong to a lawyer?
Can I drop you somewhere?
What a car!
Real leather.
Stop fighting...
Excuse me!
Come on now.
You shouldn't do this.
Why don't you tell him that.
Aghhh!
Wait, I really have no idea
who you are.
Ahh.
Aghh!
Now, you're going to get it!
You shouldn't do this!
We'll finish this.
Huh?
No harm, no pain.
Ohh...
Don't you ever try to
come across me again.
Who want this now, huh?
You cause trouble everywhere.
Hey, I'm warning you.
You'd better stop. Come on.
Oh.
Oh.
Ohh!
I don't want to
hurt you any more.
Will you stop it!
My stuff is all broke.
Someone's got to pay.
Come on.
Look, you'd better pay this.
Right now.
That guy's crazy.
I never knew you were so strong.
Miss, what are you doing?
I really like what I
found out about you.
Well, alright.
What do you want from me?
Don't treat me like that.
Well, whatever you say.
Hmm...
Please, tell me your name?
Boomer. Will you stop
fooling around, punk!
My name's, John Ma,
not Boomer.
So, where can I drop you off?
At the hospital.
Why? Are you sick?
You asked me to go see Tyson.
Oh, really?
Bad acting talent.
You're not an actor.
I know, I've played piano
since I was eight.
The Royal Music Conservatory
at age twelve.
At twenty, I won the
Beethoven Conductor Award.
Like you have lots of money?
Well...?
Oh course, you went to school
and studied over-seas then?
How did you know?
Oh, of course!
Oh...
Wow. This place!
You made me feel so good the other day.
Would you mind doing it again?
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.
I'm just a mechanic.
I'll go lie down and wait.
This joke's gone further
than I thought.
I might just have to go for it.
I'll fix her motor.
Wow, what a place.
This is great.
Hey, you know that's
very good, Beethoven?
Beethoven.
Stop!
What is it?
Continue!
Stop!
I'm sorry, go on.
OK!
Ugh.
Your turn.
Try it!
You want me...?
No.. I can't!
Sit down!
I can't wait any longer!
Hurry up! Huh?
Alright!
Huh... huh? Ahhh!
YAieee!
Huh... ohh.
Hmph... mmm?
I didn't know you drank
and smoked.
Always after a work-out.
A workout, that's all it was?
Hey, you're the one
who asked me up here.
That was very different
than the last time.
You mean, we've done this before?
Stop it.
What do you think I am?
I didn't think anything,
so what's the matter?
Huh?
Nothing?
Aren't you going to get that?
Oh. I got to go.
What concert are you talking about?
The one I'll be conducting.
Alright. No more jokes, ok?
Boomer, I thought I told you,
I never wanted to see you in here again.
Mister, you are really impolite.
You are Mister... uh?
Security!
Come on, let's get...
We have a problem.
What seems to be the problem?
I know this man,
he's always trouble around here.
Mr. Ma?!
Yes!
There must be
some kind of mistake.
Mr. Ma, is
the world famous Conductor.
You should apologize?
Sorry!
Let's get back to work.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Ma, it's an honor!
Thank you for your help.
Don't bother our guests.
I am sorry!
I have to go back to my room.
By the way, your concert
has been filled to capacity.
That's right, I almost forgot.
Thank you.
If you need anything special,
please, don't forget to ask.
Welcome, Miss!
Why do they all know you?
I really need some good help.
These clothes are ridiculous.
Let's get one thing straight,
I don't have to be your slave,
just because I slept with you.
What are you talking about?
Give me a kiss.
Stay still will you, there are people
waiting for you to perform.
Perform?
Now, we gotta do it in public?
Hey, be careful!
Let's go, come on, hurry, hurry...
Where are we going?
So, how much did you pay him
to get him to put on that show?
My room here costs four hundred a day.
Four hundred?
Yes, U.S. dollars.
You look like a Conductor.
What do you mean look like?
I really am a Conductor.
I wasn't kidding, you know.
I know you're teasing me,
but I love that.
I don't know why I let her push me around.
How did I get myself into this mess?
Anyways, she is pretty.
Not again.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ghost!
You look just like me.
We're even dressed the same.
Weird.
I don't know about you,
but I think I am going crazy.
Wow!
It's strange isn't it?
Hey, imagine.
I could be taken for you.
Ah.
No wonder the girl out there
thinks I am a musician.
She certainly thinks I'm you.
Ah.
That's why the girl doesn't believe
I'm giving a concert.
Ah.
You play in a band.
A band?
Never mind.
Well, whatever you gotta do.
What do you mean?
You're wearing my clothes.
You have to give them
back to me and fix things up.
Ok, but don't tell the girl
I'm with, alright?
Wait, do you know a Barbara?
What? You mean you know her?
I'm pretty sure, that's her name.
She got into my car and asked me
to take her to the hospital.
To see this guy, Tyson.
It's getting awfully confusing.
Aaa... choo!
Aah... choo!
How come when I sneeze, you sneeze?
That's right!
Were you on a boat lately?
You're right!
Oh. My God!
No wonder I was sea-sick.
What do you do when I get laid?
You mean with a girl?
Of course, what else would I mean?
Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho!
Hope he's not too kinky.
Oh, wait! Wait!
Hey, you'd better get
your hand off me.
You're forgetting your phone.
Thanks a lot!
Ah... Maestro!
Right on schedule!
Hey!
Are you ready?
Barbara?
What are you doing here?
Are you serious?
Is there something wrong with me?
What's going on here?
Why do I have to remind
you of every little detail?
Just a second.
Hello.
?
Who is this?
Better get your ass down here.
We've been looking for you.
Oh no, I'm no Boomer.
You've got the wrong number.
Huh?
This phone isn't mine.
They got switched around.
You just wait right here!
Wait!
Ya, Boomer?
?
I'm in the lobby with Barbara,
just tell me where you are?
I'm in the car with Tammy.
Get in here. I have to protect her.
And make it fast.
You gotta take her with you,
it's getting too dangerous.
But, I can't go inside.
I need your help to
explain something to her.
I understand.
I've got more than
I can handle, right now.
What?
What?
John, John? Hello?
Damn it the battery is dead.
Wait a second,
I need to change the phone.
Wait, please! We're going to be late.
I'll be right back.
You stay right here. Don't go away.
I'll be right back. Ok?
Where are you going?
Ah... Maestro!
This way!
That was quick.
Please, get in!
Get in! Please!
Thank you, sir.
I was really getting worried.
We're going to be late.
Driver, let's go!
Alright!
Where are we going?
To the concert.
Is that Boomer I just saw leaving
right now, in that big car?
Yeah, that was him alright.
Then, who in the heck's that?
Oh, Hi.
I thought, I just saw you leave?
Barbara, I'm glad you're here.
I have to talk with you.
Don't touch me.
Does that mean you don't know us?
Have we met before?
We're holding your little friend,
so don't mess around?
I'm not sure I understand.
We're talking about Tyson.
Don't you think you can
tell me where I'm going.
To save someone for us.
Sounds interesting.
Who's the lucky guy?
Cops got our boss.
He's in that truck right there.
No way, chase a policeman.
I'm not a race car driver.
I heard you were the best.
Now, is the time to prove it.
If you fail, Barbara and
Tyson are history.
Don't get up tight!
I'm not scared. You're the one
who needs to relax.
Oh, no! Too many people!
I'm getting out here!
Why are you scared?
Stop fooling around.
Show me you're the famous John Ma.
But, I'm not Maestro Ma.
I'm Boomer.
Now get out there!
Stop it!
I hate making jokes with my future.
You've worked so hard,
all your life, for this night.
Now, you get out there!
Show some guts!
Fine, I'll go out there,
but you'll be sorry.
Hey, where are you going?
Wait!
So many people out there.
You're baton.
What's that?
Just wave it around.
You'll be alright.
Here goes nothing.
Alright, let's move it!
Withdraw! Pull back!
We'll get you out of here, boss.
Slow down!
You wait for me
here and stay cool.
Move it!
What? What?
What's wrong with this door? Damn it!
Unlock the door!
Thanks a lot.
What? Are you sure you don't
have a reservation tonight after 9:00?
Because, I specifically remember
calling back on Tuesday the...
Ah!... Oh!
Hurry up will ya!
Tuesday, no, you don't
understand my position...
Sorry, my turn. Go away!
Hello?
Is that you John?
Hey, Boomer! I need your help
to get me out of here!
I need you here!
You don't understand!
They put me on stage. I'm
conducting your concert.
It's all turning into a disaster.
Just wave your hands
around, alright?
What's happening to you?
Get outside! Now!
Phone dead.
Just wave my hands around.
It's my concert.
Do I know who this guy is?
This is our big, big boss.
You're Big Big Boss?
Uh... huh.
Ok, hot shot, I want to go!
Come on!
That's it! That's it!
Stronger! Stronger!
More feeling?
Shut the hell up and drive!
Hey, come on!
Quit foolin' around!
Come on! Let's go!
I'm sorry!
Watch out for the car!
Are you alright? Boss!
I'll go first!
Start driving or I will kill you.
Get going!
Hey, is that them?
Step on the brake, step on it...
Here. You do it!
It's all yours!
Hey, you guys!
Now, we're on fire!
Pull the hand-brake!
Here, why don't
you do it, yourself.
Thank you. Thank you.
Out of my way!
Boss! We're coming!
Bravo!
Welcome, Mr. Ma!
You could use a little freshening up
before the reception.
We'll all be waiting in the
VIP room, for your arrival.
Mr. Ma's back!
Hello, my Dear.
Hi, is the VIP Room ready yet
for the reception?
Certainly it is ready... but?
Wait a second.
May I ask who you are?
I'm John Ma.
But, who is the man who
went to your room?
Um...
Did he come back?
I really think, we should
hurry up, for the press conference.
I have to take a shower.
I'll be right back.
John?!
Thank you.
Get in here, hurry..
You can't believe,
what just happened to me.
And what about me?
I was almost killed.
Let's forget about it.
And be ourselves.
You're Boomer;
and I am John Ma, ok?
Tell me...
Did you sleep with Barbara?
No! We didn't do anything.
Good!
Just hide yourself.
It's Tammy!
Don't you think,
you should go hide upstairs.
OK.
Hello.
It's me.
Haven't you showered yet?
There's lots of people waiting.
I know, you go down first
and I will join you soon.
Hold it.
Hmm... mm?
Give me a kiss.
" You scum!"
I'll wait downstairs.
My purse?
Hey, hold it!
Boomer, what are you doing?
I'm filling the bath tub,
what does it look like?
This whole situation is
getting out of hand.
Hey, Boomer,
what do we do?
This is ridiculous.
I think I like Barbara a little.
Don't even think about it.
Barbara is Tyson's girl, you hear?
I don't even know Tyson.
Wait a minute.
When you touch Tyson's girl;
it's like you're touching my girl.
So... stay away from her.
Do you hear?
But, you touched my girl already.
How could I know she's your girl.
It doesn't matter whether,
she is or not.
Don't mess around with her.
Wait.
Come back.
Are you telling me what to do?
One minute!
John Ma!
Are you alright?
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
Huh?
Why did you answer?
I'm John Ma.
She really thinks I'm you, I answer.
Hey, is there somebody
in there with you?
Wait! Tammy, is my girl.
I'm the one she likes.
Not you, but John Ma!
Not Boomer, you hear?
I'm not so sure.
Besides, you already...
So you want her to know that,
she's been tricked. You impostor?
John Ma!
If you don't open the door,
I'll break it down!
Uh... wait!
You'd better find a place to hide.
You better not touch her.
Why did you do that?
I'm sorry.
Are you alright?
I'm fine!
Who were you talking to?
I fool you, didn't I.
I only pretended to
be two different people.
Not bad, hey? I've showered.
Let's go downstairs.
Oh.
Uh... oh.
Tammy!
What are you doing?
Now that I'm all wet. I need to take
a bath and change my clothes.
A bath?
Will you excuse me,
I also need to take one.
I know.
Let's take one together.
I change my mind.
We took a bath together,
the other day.
We did?
Are you sure about that?
Yes, I am sure, and you didn't put your
hands all over me, you're were very nice.
You dirty rat.
You took a bath with my girl.
Huh?
So, why are you undressed,
if you're not taking a bath?
I guess I change my mind again.
I really got to try
to figure you out.
Hey!
Why have you put your clothes back on?
I need to keep them on, Tammy.
Hmm?
I must be seeing things.
Oh...
What are you doing?
Changing it!
No, need to.
The water's clean.
Didn't you just take a bath?
I always fill it up after I'm done.
It's just another habit of mine!
There is so very much
I have to learn about you.
So sweet.
And I better start now,
since I'm already yours.
Maybe it's better we don't
take a bath together.
It could take us hours.
The water is warm.
Ah!
Surprise!
Let's take a bath together!
You're so horrible.
You're such a naughty boy.
They're all waiting.
We don't have enough time.
Forget about that.
Let go!
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!
It's just a reflection,
like in a movie.
Mirror?!
It's a mirror!
You scared me to death.
I'm awfully sorry!
I'm awfully sorry!
Who's that?
Uh... Yes!
May I help you, Miss?
Where's Boomer?
Who did you say
you're looking for?
Boomer?
There must be a mistake?
I was here earlier today.
Boomer!
Barbara!
I wish you would leave.
I'm just here with my boyfriend.
Boomer!
Where are you?
Here we go again.
Hey, Boomer!
Are you here?
Wait!!
Hello.
Do you know this woman?
What are you doing?
And what kind of girl,
do you think I am?
What is it?
Crazy Kung says, bring the
case to the dock,
because, if you don't,
Tyson will be dead.
Well, who is she?
What's wrong with you?
I thought you cared!
And now I find you here
with this woman!
You've got a problem.
Hey, wait a minute
I've had enough.
Who is she?
Barbara.
And what's her name?
She's Tammy.
His fiancée.
And we're going to get married.
You're getting married?
Wait! Barbara...
You promised me, remember?
You can't go back on your word!
Just close your eyes and imagine...
Did you tell her that?
We agreed on a Spring wedding?
There's something important
you should know.
Boomer!
Where are you?!
Boomer!
Where are you?
He could be behind you.
Yes, he's just afraid.
He was scared of girls, that's why.
Come on out!
You'll see.
Boomer!
I know you're there.
Come out.
Oh, no.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I...
Wait, I know...
TV.
Yes.
Huh?
Huh?
Oh...
Oh...
Huh?
Huh?
He's real.
Oh...
Oh...
Boomer, Tyson's in trouble.
You have to find Kung, quick!
If I only knew where
he was hiding?
Wait.
At the ship yards.
And you are suppose to
bring the briefcase with you.
Then you look after them.
Hold it.
Aren't you coming back?
If I survive, I will.
Mr. Ma! Mr. Ma!
Maestro! Maestro!
Excuse me.
Alright. Come to the
Conference room for the pictures!
Thank you for your co-operation.
Hi there!
Mr. Ma!
Maestro!
This way...
Ah... Maestro!
Mr. Ma!
Ah Maestro!
Boomer!
Boomer,
we should be like brothers.
We're so alike.
Fate, is a funny thing,
you know what I mean, cuz..
If I had as many brains as you...
I could have turned out pretty good.
I'm honored to know
someone as loyal as you.
Let's get this done, together.
As friends.
Let's go get Tyson.
How do you do?
Skip it.
We're wasting time.
It's good to see you again.
Will, bring the briefcase here.
I'll take that.
Hey, hey, hey!
I have a bomb!
Hand that over here.
All of you.
Back off!
Back off!
It's full of explosives!
Do you hear me?!
Don't come near me?!
If I drop it, we will all die!
I'll check the other side.
Yeah, fine.
What are you looking at?
Huh?
Where's Tyson?
He's up there!
Hey, Boomer!
Help me!
I'm stuck!
Up here!
Are you really, Tyson?
Don't kid around, Boomer!
Can you say something
to prove who you are?
Yeah, when we were kids...
AHHH!!!
He's such a crack-up, ain't he?
Hand over the briefcase, huh?
Or goodbye to your buddy,
you know what I mean?
Move over.
Hey, Boss! Boss we got trouble!
There's another guy!
Boomer, HELP!
Ah... help me!
That was your last chance.
Ahh!!
What have I done?
That was close.
Give me that case.
It's a bomb!
Any closer and
this will explode!
Alright, I've had about enough of this.
Get him!
Step aside!
Wait, take it easy, Boss.
No, wait.
Look at that.
Somebody, go check it out.
Go on!
Ahh!!
Go!
Go on, after him!
Now what?
Tyson, get out of here!
Let's get out of here.
I trying, but I hurt my leg.
Hey, what the hell?
How did you get down here, so fast?
What are you talking about?
I've been down here the whole time.
My leg. My leg.
Come on!
AHHH!
Alright, ...uh.
Alright, It's your play.
What's that?
Your turn.
Six.
There's somebody in here.
Come on.
Wait, there really is
somebody in here.
I'm not lying!
Hey, you!
Put your hands up!
Lunch break is over.
Put your head down!
Yes, sir.
Boomer, come on!
Come on! Let's go!
Ta.. da.. da.. da..
Tyson?
Tyson!
It's so hot.
Hey, Boom...
Oh.
" Caution. Clear test area."
" Caution. "
Shut the gate!
Yeah, Boss!
Over here!
Take him!
Ugh!
Tyson?
Tyson?
Hey here, I'm here, Boomer!
Hey, I'm here in the car!
Get in the car!
Get inside!
What are you doing inside?
Let's drive our way
out of here, huh?
The car is raised up!
What are we going to do?
Huh?
Alright, check it out! Move it!
I can't see anything!
Shut up and keep looking.
Find anything?
No.
Oh, I'm sorry! Bye!
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
I didn't have much choice!
Don't you come near me!
Huh?
Boomer?
Am I glad to see you!
Heh, heh, you chicken.
Come on over here
Come on, I'll kick your ass!
Come on!
Come on!
You want some of this?
Boomer. Get him. Get him.
Chicken.
Ha, ha!
Ugh!!
Here!
Come on over here!
Hit him, Boomer! Hit him!
Come on!
You're going to
get it now, tough guy!
That's it!
Form and balance!
Ta.. da.. da.. da.
What's wrong with you?!
Ahh!
Hey, what are you doing?
Kick him in the head!
Boomer, come back here!
You should be able to kill this guy.
Is something wrong?
You're fighting like a girl!
My grandmother could beat
the shit out of this guy!
I... I was kidding.
I don't have a grandmother!
Are you okay?
Tyson's in trouble!
You've got to help him!
Ah!
Ah!
Ahhh!!
Ah!
Time out! Time out!
Hey, you!
You bastard!
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?
Hey!
I'm going to tell you one last ti...!
Boomer?
Oh, Wow!
You go finish this loser off and
I'll go turn off the heat, alright?
Oh no!
Look out Boomer,
it's coming down.
What are you trying to do, huh?
Kill me!
You know it's too hot in here.
You take care of that guy and
I'll go cool off in here, alright?
Oh, heaven.
Huh?
You were in there!
Come on!
This one's a push-over!
Who's a push-over?!
Boomer! Help me!
Run away!
Wait!
How'd you get in here?
Hey, I'll finish him.
Watch while I do it, okay?
Ahh!
Tyson!
Ahh!
Uh!
Please, don't hit me!
Boomer!
Run!
Oh... ahh.
Ah!
Ah!!
Ha.. ha.. ha...?!
Oh.. ahh!!
Huh? Ahhh!
Oh, my God!
Boomer!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Aghh...
Boom...!
I owe you one!
Come on!
I'll just stay in here, until you finish.
Hurry up!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh!
Huh? Tyson!
Get off me or die!
Boomer! Look out!!
Tyson!
Tyson?
Get up!
Will ya?
" all passengers with
seat-belts on is 99 percent. "
Tyson?
I had the seat belt on!
I had the seat belt on!
I'm going to be okay!
I'm going to kick your ass!
I've had enough.
Please, no more.
I'll make a deal.
Anything you want!
Take him!
Ahh!
I got you.
Say your prayers now, buddy?
Boomer?
Hey!
There's two of them!
And only one can fight!
Then, which one do I have?
Oh.
The think I got the fighter.
He is not Boomer,
he cannot fight you.
Why don't you come fight me?
Look behind you!
Turn around!
John, Behind you!!
Aghh!
I move, he move.
Hit him! Hit him!
Harder!
Turn around!
Kick him.
Kick...
Turn around!
Ohh!
Oh.
I'm not done with you.
So...
Tell me, which one am I actually.
John Ma! Who do you think?
I wasn't really sure,
cause when I was fighting...
Cut the crap!
Open it up!
Okay.
Where's Tyson?
Stop there!
Huh, there's two of you?
There's just one of us.
Just one?
You're seeing things.
Ah.
Get on the ground!
Move it!
There are two of you!
John!
Where is the seat belt?
Whoa... no!
" Estimated survival rate of passengers
without seat belts zero percent."
It's so beautiful.
Thanks!
What's taking them so long?
I'm very anxious to meet
the man who looks like John.
I hope he really is our son.
Now, momma. Don't get your
hopes up too high. You promised.
Yes, of course.
I won't.
Father, mother...
I still haven't seen Boomer.
I don't know where he is?
I'm afraid the wedding
will have to be cancelled.
Cancelled?!
Wait here, I have to find Boomer.
John!
Stop!
Where have you been?
Did you have to
bring the whole crowd?
I can't believe it, our son?
That's our boy?
What do we do?
We get out of here, right now!
Let's go!
Are you alright?
They're getting away!
I've got you.
Are you Boomer or John?
You're not getting away that easy.
Come on.
That one's Boomer.
No, that's Boomer.
Or is it John?
Which one of you is John?
You're ...uh?
Now, what do we do?
It doesn't make any difference!!
