It comes out of a particularly painful
part of our history.
Yes, yes.
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.
But I think it has grown from that.
I think it's something
that knits us all together.
This is your third year as Gamemaker.
What defines your personal signature?
PRIM:  No! No!
KATNISS: It's okay. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.
It was me.
I know. I know. But it's not.
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.
They're not gonna pick you.
Try to go to sleep.
I can't.
Just try. Just try.
-
- Mmm-hmm.
You remember that song? Okay.
You finish it. I've got to go.
Where?
I've just got to go.
I'll still cook you.
GALE: What are you gonna
do with that when you kill it?
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.
Of course you were.
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.
No. Not today.
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.
Okay.
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?
Won't happen.
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.
- It's sick.
- Gale.
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.
We could do it, you know?
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.
They'd catch us.
Well, maybe not.
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.
KATNISS: I have Prim,
and you have your brothers.
GALE: They can come, too.
KATNISS: Prim in the woods?
Or maybe not.
I'm never having kids.
I might, if I didn't live here.
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.
Oh, I forgot.
Here.
Oh, my God! Is this real?
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.
Happy Hunger Games.
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."
How many times is your name in today?
Forty-two.
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.
- Thank you, girl.
- Mmm-hmm.
What's this?
That's a Mockingjay.
How much?
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.
Mom.
KATNISS: Aw, look at you!
You look beautiful.
But you better tuck in that tail, little duck.
I laid something out for you, too.
Okay.
Now you look beautiful, too.
Wish I looked like you.
Oh, no. I wish I looked like you, little duck.
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.
Okay? I promise.
Shh. Shh.
Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.
- You didn't say...
- I know.
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?
WOMAN: Next.
Next.
Go ahead. Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.
It's okay.
Now, before we begin,
we have a very special film.
War. Terrible war.
PRESIDENT SNOW: War.
Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.
Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,
Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.
And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.
A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.
But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.
We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.
And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem
would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman
to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.
The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder
- This is how we safeguard our future.
-
for the honor of representing District 12
in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.
Prim! Prim!
No. No!
I volunteer! I volunteer!
I volunteer as Tribute!
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.
- No!No!
- Go find Mom!
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No!No!No!
- No! No! No!
- Come on.
EFFIE: A dramatic turn of events
here in District 12.
District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.
Come on, dear.
EFFIE: Well, I bet my hat that was your sister,
wasn't it?
Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.
PEACEKEEPER: You have three minutes.
It's okay.
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.
Just try to win. Maybe you can.
Of course.
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.
PRIM: To protect you.
Thank you.
You can't tune out again.
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?
Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.
- PEACEKEEPER: It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No!No!No!
I promise, Prim.
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.
I am.
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...
They will if you show them
how good you are.
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?
You know how to hunt.
Animals.
It's no different, Katniss.
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.
Okay.
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.
- PEACEKEEPER: Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?
You two are in for a treat.
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.
Now, before you do anything else...
EFFIE: 200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,
you get to enjoy all of this.
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.
Have you ever met him?
Haymitch?
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.
Congratulations.
Where's the ice?
I don't know.
May I?
Okay, so... So when do we start?
Whoa. So eager.
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?
Yeah, our mentor.
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.
Oh. Okay. Um...
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.
So why are you here then?
The refreshments.
Okay, I think that's enough of that.
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.
He's gonna come around.
It's no use.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
CLAUDIUS ON TV:
We have two very fit 16-year-olds.
CAESAR: Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.
CAESAR: Do you remember this year?
CLAUDIUS: Of course.
One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.
this moment is a moment
that you never forget.
CLAUDIUS: Yes.
CAESAR: The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.
That's a good way to get killed.
What's a good way to get killed?
Oh, joy. Why don't you join us?
I was just giving
some life-saving advice.
Like what?
I was just asking about how to find shelter.
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.
How do you find shelter?
Pass the jam.
How do you find shelter?
Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart.
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.
Can you pass the marmalade?
That is mahogany!
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.
You really want to know how to stay alive?
You get people to like you.
Oh.
Not what you were expecting?
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,
some water, a knife, or even some matches
can mean the difference
between life and death.
And those things only come from sponsors.
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.
There it is.
It's huge!
That's incredible.
Peeta, I love you.
Come on. Come on.
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.
what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,
-but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,
KATNISS: What's that?
What's that?
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again
before we take you to Cinna.
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.
I'm sorry that this happened to you,
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.
Most people just congratulate me.
Well, I don't see the point in that.
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.
So you're here to make me look pretty?
I'm here to help you make an impression.
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.
We'll see.
I just think somebody that brave
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?
I hope not.
Okay, this is safe. I promise.
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.
Looks pretty real to me.
Well, that's the idea.
You ready?
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.
And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.
Very nice.
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?
CLAUDIUS: Right. Right. There's District 4.
CAESAR: Yes.
- Fishing.
- CLAUDIUS: I get it.
- I like it.
- CAESAR: That's very good.
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?
And then...
What is that in the background?
Come on. They'll love it.
Yeah!
Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,
"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."
- Nope.
- I love that!
People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.
And we're ready.
PRESIDENT SNOW: Welcome.
That was amazing.
EFFIE: We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.
So brave.
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?
Fake flame? Are you sure you...
Let's go upstairs.
EFFIE: So, each of the districts
get their own floor.
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.
Come on.
So this is the living room.
I know, I know.
Now, your rooms are right over here.
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?
ATALA: In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.
One of you will be alive.
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,
particularly to what I'm about to say.
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.
Everybody wants to grab a sword,
but most of you will die
from natural causes.
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.
- CATO: Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!
CATO: You little punk! He took my knife!
- Get off me!
- JASON: I'm just sitting here.
CATO: I'll finish you right now, kid!
CATO: Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.
- ATALA: Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!
He's a Career. You know what that is?
- From District 1.
- And 2.
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.
By that point, they're pretty lethal.
But they don't receive any special treatment.
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.
So how good are they?
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...
Almost.
...they can be arrogant.
And arrogance can be a big problem.
I hear you can shoot.
I'm all right.
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.
- Peeta's strong.
- What?
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning
if somebody comes after you with a knife.
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?
It's true. Everybody knows it.
You know what my mother said?
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.
But she wasn't talking about me.
She was talking about you.
I'm not very hungry.
I'm done, too.
Throw that metal thing over there.
What?
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.
I don't care what Haymitch said.
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.
Throw it.
KATNISS: Hi.
Hey.
How did you do that?
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.
- Oh.
- I'll show you.
See?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey, I think you have a shadow.
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.
This is the time to show them everything.
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.
Hey, Katniss?
Shoot straight.
Katniss Everdeen.
District 12.
SENECA: Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!
Did you get some pig yet?
Thank you for your consideration.
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.
Mad?
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Not just you.
They just want a good show. It's fine.
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.
Nice shooting, sweetheart.
What did they do when you shot the apple?
Well, they looked pretty startled.
Oh, yeah.
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."
- Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."
Genius! Genius.
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...
On who? On her?
On him?
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.
I would have given anything to see it.
As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12
The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...
From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...
- CINNA: Excellent.
- Peeta!
CINNA: Bravo.
- We can work with that.
- HAYMITCH: Good job.
- Katniss!
- CINNA: Outstanding!
- Yes!
- CINNA: Eleven?
Congratulations.
I thought they hated me.
They must have liked your guts.
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
Goodness. We are.
An 11?
She earned it.
She shot an arrow at your head.
Well, at an apple.
Near your head.
Sit down.
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?
What do you mean?
I mean, why do we have a winner?
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?
Be a lot faster.
Hope.
Hope?
Hope.
It is the only thing stronger than fear.
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.
So...
So contain it.
Right.
EFFIE: So she's staring at all my jewels
She cannot take her eyes off of them.
CINNA: Well, look at all that
that you're wearing.
EFFIE: Frankly, it was rude.
Oh!
Haymitch, you should join us.
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.
Oh, lovely.
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.
What about him?
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.
What?
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.
PORTIA: Oh, my, yes.
CINNA: Please.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen
your master of ceremonies,
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.
CINNA: Amazing.
I don't feel amazing.
Don't you know how beautiful you look?
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.
That's different. I wasn't trying.
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?
Okay.
Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!
I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.
- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...
Marvel!
Whoo!
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.
Cato!
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,
I will be able to figure it out.
Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?
Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!
Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.
What?
CAESAR: I think someone's a little nervous.
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made
at the Tribute Parade the other day.
Do you want to tell us about it?
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.
When you came out of that chariot,
I have to say, my heart stopped.
Did any of you experience this as well?
My heart stopped.
So did mine.
Now, tell me about the flames. Are they real?
Yes.
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?
Yes.
What do you think, folks?
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
I think that's a yes.
Steady. Steady.
Lovely. Thank you.
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.
That was something. Thank you for that.
I have one more question for you.
It's about your sister.
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.
Did she come and say goodbye to you?
Yes.
- She did.
- She did.
And what did you say to her in the end?
I told her that I would try to win.
That I would try to win for her.
Of course you did.
And try you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!
You did it, darling. That was incredible.
Thank you.
Nice job, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Nice dress, too.
- Not yours.
- CAESAR: Please welcome Peeta Mellark!
How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "
It's different.
It's very different than back home.
- The showers?
- Yes.
We have different showers.
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?
- Take a whiff?
- All right.
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.
That makes sense.
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,
is there a special girl back home?
No. No. Not really.
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.
Well, there...
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.
You go out there and you win this thing,
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.
Right, folks?
-
-
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.
And why not?
Because she came here with me.
- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.
What the hell was that?
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?
HAYMITCH: Stop it! Stop it!
- KATNISS: Let's start right now!
- Hey!
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.
He's right, Katniss.
Of course I'm right.
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...
We are not star-crossed lovers.
It's a television show!
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,
which could save your damn life.
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.
Manners!
You, too?
Hey.
Can't sleep?
No. Of course not.
I'm sorry I went after you.
You know, I meant that as a compliment.
I know.
Listen to them.
Yeah.
I just don't want them to change me.
How would they change you?
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?
You mean you won't kill anyone?
No.
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else
when the time came,
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them
that they don't own me.
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
I just can't afford to think like that.
I have my sister.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.
There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it.
Why not?
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.
That's not your game.
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.
Water's your new best friend.
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.
I won't.
Katniss, you can do this.
Thanks.
WOMAN: Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?
Your tracker.
GAMEKEEPER: We're up.
We're up!
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.
There are 15 out. They are flying.
Here.
Shh.
Thank you.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Thirty seconds.
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.
Okay, they're in the tubes.
GAMEKEEPER: 50, 49, 48, 47,
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.
...eight...
...nine...
...10...
...11...
...12.
WOMAN 1: Twenty-five? Got it.
WOMAN 2: He's moving now.
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.
MARVEL: Wait!
Did you see the look on her face?
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?
GLIMMER: "Oh, no!
Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"
That's actually a good impression.
Hey, lover boy!
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
CATO: You better be.
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.
GLIMMER: Are you sure
we shouldn't just kill him now?
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.
-
- Let's go.
Sir?
She is almost at the edge.
Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...
She's heading towards the left flank.
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?
Sure. Cueing tree.
She's almost there.
Lucia, get a cannon ready.
There she is! There she is!
- She's mine!
- CATO: Not if I get her first!
- Where you gonna go?
- GLIMMER: Mine!
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.
- There she is!
- Yeah!
CATO: Here we go!
- Where you going, huh?
- GLIMMER: Get her, Cato!
CATO: Where do you think you're going?
Where you going, baby?
Three o'clock.
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.
CLOVE: Where are you going?
MARVEL: Go get her, man!
CLOVE: You are so done.
Just get her, Cato!
GLIMMER: He's gonna get you, Katniss.
MARVEL: Look at her scurry.
CLOVE: Right up there.
GLIMMER: Kill her!
MARVEL: Just go, keep going!
CLOVE: Go, Cato.
GLIMMER: Come on, Cato.
CLOVE: She's right there.
GLIMMER: Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!
You got this.
Go! He's got this.
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!
- GLIMMER: Take her down!
- CLOVE: Go! Go!
CLOVE: You got this, Cato!
MARVEL: Come on, kill her!
I'm coming for you!
CLOVE: Come on, Cato!
GLIMMER: I'll do it myself.
Give me that before...
- Get her.
- MARVEL: Come on. Come on, come on!
Maybe you should throw the sword!
PEETA: Let's just wait her out.
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.
We'll just kill her then.
Okay.
Somebody make a fire.
GLIMMER: Let's make camp over here!
MARVEL: Hurry up with the fire.
Boys.
Thank you.
Psst.
Psst.
Claudius, I think those are tracker jackers
Am I wrong?
Oh.
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.
For those of you who don't know,
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,
powerful hallucinations,
and in extreme cases, death.
PEETA: Run.
Run!
Run!
Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a tracker jacker sting
can produce powerful hallucinations.
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!
PEETA'S VOICE: Katniss, go!
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!
KATNISS: Rue?
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You want mine, too?
No, that's okay.
Here.
Thanks.
How long was I asleep?
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.
Thank you.
So what happened while I was out?
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.
And the boy from my district?
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.
Is all of that true?
What?
You and him?
So where are Cato and the others?
They got all their supplies
down by the lake.
That sounds tempting.
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.
Light this one last,
and I'll meet you back over there.
RUE: Right.
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.
Okay. Like what?
Here. Watch this.
Mockingjays. That's great.
Back home,
we use them to signal all the time.
You try.
Okay, so if we hear that,
it means we're okay
and we'll be back real soon.
We're gonna be okay.
Hey, I'll see you for supper.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!
Let's go.
You stay guard and don't move
until we can get back.
I want to see if she's gonna figure out
this booby trap.
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines
CAESAR:
She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?
GUARD: I don't know what happened.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!
CATO: Our stuff!
RUE: Katniss!
Katniss!
Katniss, help!
Katniss!
Katniss! Help!
Katniss!
Katniss!
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.
Did you blow up the food?
Every bit of it.
Good.
You have to win.
Can you sing?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
HAYMITCH: Don't kill her.
You'll just create a martyr.
SENECA:
Well, it seems we've already got one.
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.
What do you want?
You have a lot of anger out there.
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.
Such as?
Young love.
So you like an underdog?
Everyone likes an underdog.
I don't.
Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?
Not personally. No.
Well, I have.
There are lots of underdogs.
Lots of coal, too.
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.
There are lots of underdogs.
And I think if you could see them,
you would not root for them either.
I like you.
Be careful.
The regulations requiring a single victor
have been suspended.
Peeta.
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!
Hi.
It's okay.
What was it?
A sword.
It's bad, huh?
It's gonna be fine.
Ah!
- Katniss.
-
- Katniss.
- No!
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Nobody's gonna find you in here.
They already found me.
We'll just get you some medicine.
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.
We'll figure something out.
Like what?
Something.
PEETA: Medicine?
KATNISS: No. Soup.
I'll do it.
That's nice.
You fed me once.
I think about that all the time.
How I tossed you that bread.
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.
I should have just gone out in the rain and...
You feel hot.
I remember the first time I saw you.
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.
The teacher said,
"Who knows The Valley Song?”
And your hand shot straight up.
Stop.
After that,
I watched you going home every day.
Every day-
Well, say something.
I'm not good at saying something.
Then come here.
Please.
- Even if I don't make it...
- Shh.
Stop it.
Commencing at sunrise,
there will be a feast tomorrow
Your medicine.
You're not going alone.
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?
Why are you doing this?
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.
Peeta...
Please.
Stay.
Okay.
I'll stay.
Oh, God!
Where's lover boy?
Oh, I see. You were gonna help him, right?
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.
That little girl? What was her name again?
Rue?
Yeah, well, we killed her.
And now we're gonna kill you.
You kill her?
- No!
- I heard you!
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!
You said her name!
Just this time, 12.
For Rue.
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.
No, you're not. What happened?
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.
You got worse.
I'm sorry.
You need some of that, too.
I'm okay.
That feels better.
Okay. Now you.
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.
Come on.
All right.
Hi.
Oh. You're so much better.
Oh, my God, Peeta.
PEETA: I hardly feel anything.
We could go home.
We could. We're the only team left.
We could go home.
PEETA: We know Thresh took off.
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.
Foxface, she could be anywhere.
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.
Okay, I'll take the bow.
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.
Peeta?
Peeta?
Peeta!
Peeta!
Are you okay?
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!
I didn't know.
You scared me to death. Damn you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
PEETA: I never even knew
she was following me.
KATNISS: She's clever.
Too clever.
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.
PEETA: What time is it?
KATNISS: A little after noon.
PEETA: Why is it getting so dark?
Must be in a hurry to end it.
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.
Well, that's great.
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.
That's it. That's excellent.
Did you hear that?
What was that?
It's the finale.
Let's go.
PEETA: Go.
Katniss!
Here!
Go on. Shoot.
Then we both go down and you'd win.
Go on. I'm dead anyway.
I always was, right?
I didn't know that till now.
How is that? Is that what they want? Huh?
- PEETA: No.
- No, no.
I could still do this.
I could still do this.
One more kill.
It's the only thing I know how to do.
Bring pride to my district.
Not that it matters.
CATO: Please!
No!
Please!
allowing for two victors
from the same district,
Go ahead.
One of us should go home.
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.
No.
They don't.
Why should they?
- PEETA: No!
- KATNISS: Trust me.
Trust me.
Together?
Together.
Okay.
One...
Two...
Three.
CLAUDIUS:
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners
KATNISS: Why? Because I didn't die?
Because you showed them up.
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!
This is serious. Not just for you.
They don't take these things lightly.
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.
You were so in love with this boy
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?
I felt like the happiest person in the world.
I couldn't imagine life without him.
Oh.
And what about you, Peeta?
She saved my life.
We saved each other.
CAESAR: Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!
PRESIDENT SNOW: Congratulations.
Thank you.
What a lovely pin.
Thank you. It's from my district.
They must be very proud of you.
So what happens when we get back?
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.
I don't want to forget.
