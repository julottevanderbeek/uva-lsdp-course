HEY, THIS IS JOHNNY PHOENIX
FOR THE X.F.L.,
REMINDING THE FANS HERE
AT PRUDENTIAL STADIUM TO BE SAFE
ON THE WAY HOME.
HUT !
BIG THIRD DOWN FOR
THE EXPANSION ROADRUNNERS.
THEIR PLAY-OFF HOPES
COULD HINGE ON THIS PLAY.
A LOT OF PRESSURE
ON YOUNG JOHNNY PHOENIX.
AS IF BEING THE FIRST
QUARTERBACK TO EARN 300 MILLION
ISN'T PRESSURE ENOUGH.
RED !  THIRTY-TWO !
RED !  THIRTY-TWO !
STRONG LEFT !
- HOLD !  HOLD !
- WALK IT !  WALK IT !
BLUE !  TWO THIRTY-NINE !
BLUE !
DOWN !
SET !  HUT !  HUT !
-
GET UP, JOHNNY !
- YOU ALL RIGHT ?
THE OWNER WANTS JOHNNY TO HAVE
THE ABSOLUTE BEST OF CARE.
HE'S GONNA NEED IT.
HIS SIXTH CERVICAL VERTEBRA
IS CRUSHED.
IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD
AS YOU THINK IT IS.
THE STATUS ?
WE HAVE A LIFETIME CONTRACT
WITH A VEGETABLE.
MAYBE WE CAN TRADE HIM
TO L.A.
OKAY, TERMINATE
HIS CONTRACT AND BRING HIM BACK
TO THE LAB.  YOU UNDERSTAND ?
SURE.
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.
SORRY, JOHNNY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE ONE
FOR THE TEAM.
DO I LOOK ANY DIFFERENT
TO YOU ?
OH, GEE.
YOU SHAVED YOUR MOUSTACHE.
- NEVER HAD A MOUSTACHE.
- OH.  THEN NO.
JOHNNY PHOENIX
WILL PLAY NEXT WEEK.
EARLY DIAGNOSIS
HAD HIM SIDELINED.
AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION,
HIS INJURIES PROVED
TO BE MINOR.
GOOD MORNING, ADAM.
AT 11:00, YOU HAVE A
V.I.P. CLIENT, MICHAEL DRUCKER.
AND BY THE WAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
I DON'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT.
HMM.
- IS CLARA UP YET ?
- YEAH, SHE'S WATCHING TV
WITH OLIVER.
YOU GONNA SPEND ALL DAY
LOOKING FOR NEW WRINKLES ?
OR ARE YOU GONNA GET IN HERE
AND GIVE ME A KISS ?  HMM ?
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IF I HAVE TO.
- OH, BULLY !
YOU'RE NOT GETTIN'
ANY KISSES NOW !
YOU KNOW, YOU...
DON'T LOOK ANY DIFFERENT.
NO.  YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER
THAN WHEN WE MET.
I LOVE YOU.
LOCK THE DOOR.
OH, GOD !
DADDY, DADDY,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY !
- WHAT ?
- YOU ALWAYS MAKE DADDY
FEEL SO GOOD.
CAREFUL, YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE OLD FOR THAT.
- I AM NOT !
- NO, I MEANT YOUR FATHER.
- VERY FUNNY.
- COME ON.
I MADE YOU BREAKFAST.
-OH, GREAT !
- YUM !
-COME ON, DAD !
I CAN'T FIND YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU ?
RIGHT BEHIND YOU, DAD.
- I'M HERE, RIGHT HERE !
- YOU'RE HIDING
UNDER THE TABLE !
BECAUSE OF THEIR SHORTER
LIFE SPAN, THESE FAMILY MEMBERS
CAN'T HELP BUT BREAK OUR HEARTS.
SHOULD ACCIDENT, ILLNESS OR AGE
END YOUR PET'S NATURAL LIFE--
OLIVER,
HAVE YOU SEEN CLARA SOMEWHERE ?
OUR TECHNOLOGY
CAN HAVE HIM BACK THE SAME
DAY IN PERFECT HEALTH...
WITH ZERO DEFECTS GUARANTEED,
THANKS TO REPET.
NACHO FLAVORED
OR REGULAR ?
I'LL TAKE BANANA FLAVORED.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE THIS CARD.
BEAUTIFUL.
- DAD, CAN I HAVE A SIM-PAL
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY ?
- A GIFT ON MY BIRTHDAY ?
THAT WAY YOU WON'T FEEL GUILTY
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
GETTING SOMETHING.
- WHAT'S A SIM-PAL ?
- A LIFE-SIZE DOLL.
A MAKE-BELIEVE FRIEND
THAT GROWS REAL HAIR
AND CAN DO A LOT OF STUFF.
CAN'T YOUR REAL FRIENDS
GROW REAL HAIR
AND DO LOTS OF STUFF ?
YEAH, BUT THEY ALL HAVE
SIM-PALS.
ASK YOUR MOMMY.
YOU'RE THE GREATEST, DAD !
MOMMY !  MOMMY !
I'M GONNA GET A SIM-PAL !
YOU'RE GETTING LOW ON MILK.
THANK YOU
FOR ORDERING MILK.
YOU'RE GETTING SO FAST.
INTO THE CAR.  VERY NICE.
BYE-BYE.  SEE YOU.
HEY.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON ?
OH, I HAD A BREAKFAST
OF CHAMPIONS TODAY.
OH, YEAH ?
DESTINATION DOUBLE X
CHARTER AIRPORT SELECTED.
THE GIRL WOULDN'T STOP TALKING.
MY VIRTUAL GIRLFRIEND,
SHE TALKS, BUT AT LEAST
I CAN TURN HER OFF.
YOU AND YOUR VIRTUAL GIRLS.
HERE YOU ARE, A GROWN MAN,
AND YOUR PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP
IS WITH A PIECE OF SOFTWARE.
IF YOUR SENSES TELL YOU YOU HAVE
A HOT CHICK ON YOUR LAP, YOU
HAVE A HOT CHICK ON YOUR LAP.
I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK
ANY FURTHER, OKAY ?
THEY INVENTED THE LASER RAZOR.
NO NICKS, CUTS OR SCRATCHES.
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT USING IT.
I LIKE THE OLD-FASHIONED
KIND.  THEY REMIND ME
I'M STILL ALIVE.
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
AT KELLY'S AFTER WORK ?
I KNOW THAT NATALIE
IS THROWING ME
A SURPRISE PARTY.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?
BECAUSE I TOLD HER
YOU TOLD ME.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
OH, YES.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT ?
I DIDN'T.
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW,
AND NOW I KNOW.
CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS THAT EASY.
YOUR DESTINATION, DOUBLE X
CHARTER AIRPORT, IS AHEAD.
- ON STAR WILL NOW DISENGAGE
AUTOMATIC DRIVE.  READY ?
- YES.
MANUAL DRIVE ENGAGED.
I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR
AT THE PARTY TONIGHT.
WHAT ?  DON'T GET DRUNK
AND SET THE DRAPES ON FIRE ?
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME THAT.
THAT TOO.  BUT WHAT I WAS GOING
TO SAY WAS AROUND 11:00, 11:30,
I WANT YOU TO START SINGING
REALLY LOUD, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."
FOR WHAT ?
AND THE WAY YOU SING,
IT'S GONNA CLEAR OUT THE PLACE
LIKE A BOMB SCARE.
I GET IT.
YOU AND NATALIE HAVE A LITTLE
PRIVATE PARTY PLANNED.
GOOD MORNING, ROSIE.
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.
HELLO, ADAM.  HI, HANK.
HENRY CHECKED OUT
THE UPGRADE ON THE REMOTE.
HE SAYS YOU'LL LOVE IT.
OH, THEY CAME IN !
THIS IS GREAT.
LOOK AT THIS.
OH, AND DRUCKER'S OFFICE
JUST CALLED.  GUESS WHAT ?
THEY CANCELLED.
NO.  WE'RE ALL GONNA BE TESTED
FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.
SO ?
OH, THIS IS COOL !
- WE'RE GONNA BE TESTED ?
- NOT YOU GUYS.
JUST US PILOTS.
HANK, LOOK AT THIS.
THE NEW REMOTE CAME IN.
OUT GOES THE OLD ONE.
GET RID OF IT.
ADAM, THIS IS TRIPP.
TRIPP, THIS IS ADAM.
IT'S HIS FIRST TIME WITH US.
WELCOME.
HOW YA DOING ?
ADAM,
NATALIE'S ON LINE ONE.
WHAT'S UP, HONEY ?
YOU LOOK UPSET.
OH, ADAM !
I JUST TALKED TO THE VET,
AND THEY HAD--
THEY HAD TO PUT OLIVER TO SLEEP.
WHAT ?
HE WASN'T THAT SICK.
I KNOW, BUT APPARENTLY
HE HAD SOME KIND OF HIGHLY
INFECTIOUS VIRUS OR SOMETHING.
AND THEY HAD TO PUT HIM DOWN.
IT'S THE LAW.
- OLIVER WAS LICKING
CLARA'S FACE THIS MORNING.
- DON'T WORRY.  I ASKED.
AND THE VIRUS IS HARMLESS
TO HUMANS, SO SHE'S FINE.
THIS IS GOING TO BREAK
HER HEART
AND YOU KNOW THAT.
NO, IT WON'T.
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN TO REPET
AND GET OLIVER REPLACED.
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE SOME
FREAK OF SCIENCE SLEEPING
IN MY DAUGHTER'S BED.
- NO !  OLIVER CAN LIVE ON
IN OUR MEMORIES.
-IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.
SHE'S ONLY EIGHT.
SHE WON'T UNDERSTAND THAT,
HONEY.
LOOK, IT'S THE NATURAL PROCESS
OF LIFE.  YOU'RE BORN,
YOU LIVE AND YOU DIE.
SHE HAS TO LEARN ABOUT IT
SOMEDAY.
-BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LEARN
ABOUT IT ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
- WILL YOU DO IT ?
- NO.
- THANK YOU.
CLARA THANKS YOU TOO.
- NO.  I WON'T DO IT.
LISTEN.  NATALIE,
I JUST WON'T--
DOUBLE X CHARTER,
YOUR PASSPORT
TO OUTDOOR ADVENTURE.
NO USE FIGHTING.
WE ALWAYS WIN.
FLYING YOU
TO BREATHTAKING VISTAS
AT WORLD PREMIERE LOCATIONS.
FOR INCREDIBLE SKIING AND
SNOWBOARDING, DOUBLE X CHARTER.
TRIPP, YOU CAN GO
IN THIS ONE.
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.
YOU GUYS COME WITH ME.
COME ON.  LET'S GO.
WHOO, MAN !
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GREAT.
NINE-SEVEN-FOUR-SEVEN,
YOU'RE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.
EVERYONE HAS THEIR MAPS ?
G.P.S. ?  EMERGENCY BEACONS ?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT,
ANY QUESTIONS ?
YEAH, I GOT A QUESTION.
EXCUSE ME.
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE REPETS ?
YEAH, I GOT A DOG.
I GOT A SNAKE.
- I GOT YOUR POINT.
- DOGS, SNAKES OR AT LEAST
KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO HAS ONE ?
- I KNOW SOMEBODY, YEAH.
-
- YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.
PROUD OF YOURSELF ?
- VERY.
SEE YOU GUYS.
I KNOW YOU'RE OLD SCHOOL,
BUT ALL THE KIDS TODAY,
THEY GREW UP WITH REPETS.
- THESE DAYS
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL.
- NOT TO ME.
NOT TO YOU.  YOU WANT YOUR KID
CRYING BECAUSE HER DOG DIED ?
DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S EVEN A LITTLE BIT CREEPY ?
NO.
I DON'T.
LET'S TEST THE REMOTE.
SEE IF YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH ME.
ALL RIGHTY, HERE WE GO.
THESE REPETS,
THEY COME BACK TO YOU,
YOU CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
- TRUST ME, I HAD IT DONE.
- BULLSHIT.
I'M SERIOUS !
SADIE, MY CAT.
- SHE'S A REPET.
- YOU HAD YOUR CAT CLONED ?
- YEAH, SHE FELL OUT
OF MY CONDO WINDOW.
-OUCH.
SHIT !
WHOO !
WHOA !
YOU DID WELL.
THANK YOU.
HOW LONG ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO KEEP ME AT KELLY'S ?
TILL 7:00.  WHY ?
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHECK OUT REPET.
GOOD MORNING.
YOU GENTLEMEN THE OWNERS ?
YEP, THAT'S US.
EXCELLENT.
LARRY STERN.
I'M WITH MR. DRUCKER'S
ADVANCE TEAM.
I'VE GOT A CONTRACT HERE.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT
PRETTY STANDARD EXCEPT FOR--
WHO WAS FLYING THAT ONE ?
ME...
WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL.
- WE CAN FLY FOUR OF THESE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US NOW.
- AMAZING.
- HERE FOR THE BLOOD TEST ?
- NO.  MY TECHNICIAN
IS SET UP IN YOUR OFFICE.
YOU SAID THESE FORMS
ARE STANDARD EXCEPT WHAT ?
IT'S OUR NORMAL
CHARTER CONTRACT.
IT HAS A NONDISCLOSURE CLAUSE.
DURING THE FLIGHT,
YOU MAY OVERHEAR
MR. DRUCKER'S PHONE CALLS.
IT COULD BE ANYTHING
FROM BIG MERGERS TO INSIDE
INFORMATION ON HIS SPORTS TEAMS.
REGARDLESS, WE HAVE
A LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO PROTECT THAT STUFF.
WHAT DOES THIS GUY THINK ?
HE'S THE PRESIDENT ?
NO, HE CONSIDERS HER
TO BE THE WORLD'S SECOND
MOST IMPORTANT PERSON.
OOH, THAT'S BIG STUFF.
ALL FOR A DAY
OF SNOWBOARDING ?
THE BLOOD TEST WAS AGONY.
SERIOUSLY, I WAS SCREAMING.
SHE'S JUST KIDDING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT REALLY DOESN'T HURT.
JUST PRESS YOUR THUMB HERE.
- RIGHT HERE ?
-YES, JUST LIKE THAT.
- ALL DONE.
- DIDN'T FEEL A THING.
NEED TO CHECK YOUR VISION.
PLACE YOUR CHIN HERE.
LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.
- RIGHT HERE ?
- MM-HMM.
DO YOU BLOOD TEST
ALL YOUR PILOTS ?
PILOTS, DRIVERS, ASSISTANTS.
ANYONE WHO COMES IN CONTACT
WITH MR. DRUCKER.
HMM.
- ALL RIGHT, I PRESS HERE ?
- YEP.
AND HERE.
PERFECT, BOTH OF YOU.
AFTER THIS, I'M GOING TO TOWN
TO TEST A CHEF AND TWO WAITERS.
THE PINK COPY
OF THE CONTRACT IS YOURS.
I'LL TAKE THE REST.
HERE WE GO.
HAVE A NICE FLIGHT,
GENTLEMEN.
TA-TA.
YOU KNOW, I COULD
TAKE CARE OF DRUCKER.
THAT WAY, YOU COULD HAVE
TIME TO GET OLIVER CLONED.
I'M NOT GETTING THE DOG CLONED.
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK IT OUT.
I KNOW, BUT ONCE YOU SEE IT,
YOU'RE GONNA SAY YES.
I KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU'RE A SOFTY.
UM, THEY SPECIFICALLY
ASKED FOR ADAM BY NAME.
I KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY MEANS.
I ALSO KNOW THAT THE BODYGUARDS
CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
THEY NEVER GOT OUR NAMES.
OH !
THAT'S TRUE.
I KNOW THAT
I SCREW AROUND A LOT.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FLYING,
YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS.
I COULD DO IT.
GO ENJOY YOUR BIRTHDAY.
IF YOU WANT TO BE ME,
TRY TO ACT
A LITTLE BIT MORE MANLY.
YEAH.
CHEST.
OKAY ?  CHEST OUT.
STOMACH IN.
THERE YOU ARE.
STOMACH.  ALL RIGHT.
GET ME THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
I WANT THE SPEAKER THERE.
NO, YOU DON'T MENTION
MY NAME AT ALL.  HUH ?
HANG ON A SECOND, DAVE.
HI, I'M MICHAEL DRUCKER.
YOU MUST BE ADAM GIBSON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ADAM'S THE NAME
AND FLYING'S THE GAME.
PETE HUME SPEAKS HIGHLY OF YOU.
HE SAYS YOU KNOW
THE MOUNTAINS LIKE NOBODY ELSE.
THANK YOU.  THAT'S PROBABLY
TRUE FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT
MY PARTNER, BUT THANK YOU.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
SO, WE ALL SET ?
YES, SIR.
WE'VE STATIONED OUR PEOPLE
MONITORING THE RESCUE BEACONS--
DON'T NEED THE DETAILS.
ALL RIGHT !
YOUR FAVORITE SNOWBOARD'S
BEHIND YOUR SEAT, SIR.
DAVE, LOOK, WE GAVE A LOT
OF MONEY TO HIS CAMPAIGN,
NOT TO MENTION WHAT
I PAY YOUR LAW FIRM,
SO I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
ARE YOU GONNA GET ME
THE SPEAKER ?  GOOD.
SO, SALLY, WHO'S NEXT ?
OKAY, PUT HIM ON.
YOU OWN THE ROADRUNNERS,
RIGHT ?
HEY, BUDDY, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP !  WE'RE HERE.
WOODLAND MALL.
OH.
I WAS ASLEEP.
WELCOME TO WOODLAND MALL.
OVER 1200 RETAIL OUTLETS
TO SERVE YOU.
FOOD COURT, GROUND LEVEL.
STOP THE CLONING.
SAY NO TO REPET.
STOP THE CLONING.
SAY NO TO REPET.
STOP THE CLONING.
SAVE YOUR SOUL, MAN.
GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO GO IN THERE.
THEN GOD SHOULDN'T HAVE KILLED
MY DOG.
ATHEIST.
STOP THE CLONING.
SAY NO TO REPET.
WE CAN CLONE YOUR
FOUR-LEGGED LOVED ONE
IN JUST A FEW SHORT HOURS.
HOW CAN WE DO IT ?
IT ALL BEGINS WITH
THE GROWING OF BLANKS,
ANIMAL DRONES
STRIPPED OF ALL
CHARACTERISTIC D.N.A.,
IN EMBRYONIC TANKS
AT THE REPET FACTORY.
IN STAGE TWO, YOUR PET'S D.N.A.
IS EXTRACTED FROM A LOCK OF FUR
OR DROP OF BLOOD...
AND THEN INFUSED
ON A CELLULAR LEVEL
INTO THE BLANK.
IN THE FINAL STAGE,
USING REPET'S PATENTED
CEREBRAL SYNCORDING PROCESS,
ALL OF YOUR PET'S THOUGHTS,
MEMORIES AND INSTINCTS...
ARE PAINLESSLY TRANSPLANTED
VIA THE OPTIC NERVE.
STILL CAN'T MAKE UP
YOUR MIND, HUH ?
YOU LOST A DOG, RIGHT ?
YES.  MY DAUGHTER'S.
OH, WHAT A HEARTBREAK.
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS AGAIN ?
OLIVER.
WELL, OLIVER'S IN LUCK.
WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL
THIS WEEK, 20% OFF.
WHEN DID OLIVER DIE ?
SOMETIME THIS MORNING.
THAT'S PERFECT.
WE CAN STILL DO
A POSTMORTEM SYNCORDING.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ACT FAST.
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY A 12-HOUR
WINDOW ON DECEASED BRAINS.
I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT WHOLE IDEA.
I MEAN, SUPPOSE
THAT CLONES HAVE NO SOUL,
OR THEY'RE DANGEROUS.
CLONE PETS ARE EVERY BIT
AS SAFE AS REAL PETS.
PLUS... THEY'RE INSURED.
IF IT IS SO SAFE,
THEN WHY IS IT AGAINST THE LAW
TO CLONE HUMAN BEINGS ?
BECAUSE THE HUMAN BRAIN
IS MUCH TOO COMPLICATED
TO SYNCORD.
NOW, YOU REMEMBER THAT
EXPERIMENT THEY DID, RIGHT ?
YES.
THAT'S WHY THAT DIDN'T WORK.
NOW IT'S ILLEGAL TO EVEN TRY.
BUT WITH PETS,
IT'S A TOTALLY PROVEN
TECHNOLOGY.
YOUR REPET, OLIVER, WILL BE
EXACTLY THE SAME DOG.
HE'LL KNOW ALL THE
SAME TRICKS YOU TAUGHT HIM,
WHERE THE BONES ARE BURIED.
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A CLONE.
AND, DID I MENTION ?
THEY'RE INSURED.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE INSURANCE.
I CARE ABOUT IF I CAN TRUST
MY DAUGHTER WITH A LARGE ANIMAL
WITH SHARP TEETH.
WE CAN MAKE HIM SMALLER
IF YOU WANT, WITH SOFTER TEETH.
YOU CAN ?
WE CAN EVEN COLOR COORDINATE HIM
TO MATCH YOUR DECORATING SCHEME.
-  SIM-PAL,
THE BEST FRIEND MONEY CAN BUY.
- LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.
-TREAT YOUR KIDS
TO A SIM-PAL TODAY.
- I MIGHT BE BACK.
YOU'LL BE BACK.
YOUR DAUGHTER WILL THINK
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD.
MY KID SISTER HAS TWO OF
THESE, AND SHE LOVES THEM.
OH, GOOD.
LET'S FIX THE COLLAR.
THERE YOU ARE.
IT'S AMAZING
HOW REAL THIS IS.
I KNOW.
MY DAUGHTER WILL BE SO EXCITED.
COME, LET'S GO HOME.
-
YOU HAVE CALLED HANK MORGAN.
- I'M NOT HERE. LEAVE A MESSAGE.
HANK, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU ?
I WAITED AT KELLY'S
FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR.
IT'S NOW FIVE PAST SEVEN.
I'M SIM-PAL CINDY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
LOOK, I'M HEADING HOME.
IF YOU GET THIS MESSAGE--
LET'S BE FRIENDS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
JUST--  CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M TALKING ?  QUIET.
HEAD OVER TO MY HOUSE
WITH A BUNCH OF FLOWERS
AND A GOOD EXCUSE.
OTHERWISE NATALIE'S
GONNA KILL YOU.
I CAN SING SONGS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SING WITH ME ?
EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO TURN THIS THING OFF ?
- I CAN PLAY GAMES.
- MY NIECE HAS ONE.
SAY, "GO TO SLEEP, CINDY."
GO TO SLEEP, CINDY.
I CAN SING SONGS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SING WITH ME ?
GO TO SLEEP.
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.
GOOD NIGHT.
CLARA, SWEETIE, HONEY.
OLIVER WAS VERY SICK,
AND HE HAD TO BE PUT DOWN.
CLARA, SWEETIE, HONEY.
OLIVER HAD TO GO TO HEAVEN.
"WHY, DADDY ?"
YOU SEE, IT'S BECAUSE--
IT'S BECAUSE--
OH, SHIT, OLIVER !
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE ?
OLIVER ?
NATALIE.
?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ??
?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR ADAM ??
?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ????
I KNOW.  CAN YOU HELP ME ?
ONE, TWO, THREE !
LOOK AT THIS CAKE HERE !
I KNOW !
OH, MY GOD !
- ADAM GIBSON ?
- WHO ARE YOU ?
WE HAVE A LITTLE SITUATION.
WILL YOU COME WITH US ?
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE ?
JUST COOPERATE
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.
FINE ?  THERE'S SOMEONE
IN MY HOUSE,
EATING MY BIRTHDAY CAKE...
WITH MY FAMILY,
AND IT'S NOT ME !
WE KNOW.
THERE'S BEEN
A SIXTH DAY VIOLATION.
A HUMAN WAS CLONED.
THAT HUMAN WAS YOU.
WE CAN HELP YOU.
- THEN GET HIM OUT OF THERE !
- BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
WITH US.
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE HELL YOU PEOPLE ARE.
BUT I'M GOING INSIDE
MY HOUSE.
YEAH, RIGHT.
- OOPS.  CINDY FELL DOWN.
- GET THE DOLL.
NOT HERE !
I'M SIM-PAL CINDY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
I CAN PLAY GAMES.
-
-
- SHIT !
-
WILEY, NO, HOLD YOUR FIRE !
THAT WAY !  GO !
VINCENT, GO !
I HAVE A BOO-BOO.
STOP THE CAR !
STOP THE CAR !
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION !
DON'T EVEN BLINK.
OH, MY GOD.
SOMEONE STOLE THE MINIVAN.
THEY STOLE MY CADILLAC !
OH, NO !
CAR CHASE.  COOL !
- WHO ARE YOU ?
- I WAS HIRED TO KILL YOU.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW !
I'M SIM-PAL CINDY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
PLEASE SECURE
CHILD SEAT RESTRAINT.
LET'S BE FRIENDS.
-WHERE IS THIS GUY ?
-I'M SIM-PAL CINDY.
- SHH.
- LET'S BE FRIENDS.
- SHH.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
- WILL YOU BE MY MOMMY ?
- I DON'T WANNA BE YOUR MOMMY !
- SHUT UP !
- WHAT ?
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT DAMN DOLL !
I HAVE A BOO-BOO.
THIS IS CRAZY.
WHY DOES ANYONE WANT
TO KILL ME ?
HE GOT HOME FIRST.
YOU SAW HIM.  HE DIDN'T SEE YOU.
YOU'RE SCREWED.
HE'S GONNA LIVE OUT THE REST
OF YOUR BORING LITTLE LIFE
AND NEVER BE THE WISER.
YOUR WIFE AND KID SEE YOU
AND HIM TOGETHER,
THEY'LL BE KILLED.
- WHOA !
-
- OH, SHIT !
-
NO !
GODDAMN IT, WILEY !
SON OF A BITCH !
STUPID !
BLOW OUT HIS TIRES THIS TIME !
OH... SHIT !
YES !
THAT WAS SPECTACULAR.
OH, SON OF A BITCH.
HOLD MY BELT.
- OKAY.
-
YOU GOT ME ?
YEAH.
LITTLE MORE.
OH !
LET'S GET SOME PEOPLE DOWNRIVER
AND LOOK FOR THIS GUY.
GO PICK UP WILEY
AND TALIA'S BODIES,
GET 'EM BACK TO THE LAB.
WEIR CLINIC, STAY AWAY !
HELLO, I'M DR. GRIFFIN WEIR.
WELCOME TO THE NEW HOME
OF THE WEIR ORGAN
TRANSPLANT FACILITY--
THANKS FOR VISITING
REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGIES.
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF LIFE.
DR. WEIR, PROTESTORS CLAIM
CLONING HUMAN ORGANS...
WILL INEVITABLY LEAD
TO CLONING WHOLE HUMANS.
THAT'S NOT ONLY ILLEGAL,
BUT WE'RE YEARS AWAY FROM
THE TECHNICAL ABILITY TO DO IT.
BUT A HUMAN WAS CLONED
OVER TEN YEARS AGO, DOCTOR.
AND WE ALL KNOW THE OUTCOME
OF THAT BIZARRE EXPERIMENT.
IF YOU RECALL, THE SUPREME COURT
ORDERED THAT THE CLONE
BE DESTROYED, AND I THINK...
THAT UNDER THE CONDITIONS,
IT WAS THE HUMANE THING TO DO.
IT LED TO THE LAWS
AGAINST HUMAN CLONING...
AND SET BACK THE COURSE
OF LEGITIMATE RESEARCH
BY MANY YEARS.
MR. DRUCKER ?  MR. DRUCKER ?
YOU GAVE $100 MILLION--
THIS IS DR. WEIR'S NIGHT.
DR. WEIR, IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
THE SIXTH DAY LAWS REPEALED ?
DR. WEIR IS INTERESTED
IN MEDICINE, NOT POLITICS.
MR. DRUCKER,
THE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE CLAIM
THAT YOU RUN REPET AT A LOSS...
IN ORDER TO SOFTEN PEOPLE UP
TO THE IDEA OF HUMAN CLONING.
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T FORGET
THAT NOT SO LONG AGO...
THERE WERE LITERALLY
ALMOST NO MORE FISH
LEFT IN THE OCEAN.
AND HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
FACED A VERY REAL THREAT
OF HUNGER.
OUR CLONING TECHNOLOGY
HELPED TURN THAT AROUND.
THE EXTREMISTS
DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT...
THAT THEY'D RATHER
THE WORLD WENT HUNGRY
THAN EAT CLONED FISH.
SO INSTEAD THEY KEEP YELLING
ABOUT HUMAN CLONING.
DO YOU THINK
THE HUMAN CLONING LAWS
SHOULD BE CHANGED ?
SUPPOSE A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY LIES
IN A HOSPITAL BED
DYING OF LIVER CANCER.
THANKS TO DR. WEIR'S WORK,
WE CAN SAVE THAT BOY.
NOW, IN THE NEXT BED LIES
ANOTHER TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY...
WHOSE PARENTS
LOVE HIM JUST AS MUCH.
ONLY THIS CHILD HAS
AN INOPERABLE BRAIN TUMOR.
NOW, YOU CANNOT CLONE
A BRAIN.
THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE HIM
WOULD BE TO CLONE
THE WHOLE PERSON.
HOW DO YOU TELL
THAT BOY'S PARENTS
THAT WE CAN SAVE THE FIRST BOY,
BUT THE RESEARCH
THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED THEIR SON,
IT WASN'T DONE BECAUSE OF A LAW
THAT WAS PASSED BY FRIGHTENED
POLITICIANS A DECADE AGO ?
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?
ENJOY THE PARTY.
LOOKED LIKE YOU NEEDED RESCUING.
YES, MICHAEL, I DID.
THANK YOU.
WEIR CLINIC, STAY AWAY !
NO RESEARCH ON D.N.A. !
WEIR CLINIC, STAY AWAY !
NO RESEARCH ON D.N.A. !
-
HEY, BOSS !
- JOHNNY !
HOW'S MY STAR QUARTERBACK ?
I'D SAY I WAS FEELING LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS, EXCEPT
I'D HATE TO TAKE A CUT IN PAY.
DON'T REMIND ME,
ALL RIGHT ?
THAT WAS ONE NASTY HIT
YOU TOOK LAST WEEK.
BE CAREFUL, SON.
WE DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING KILLED OUT THERE.
KATHERINE ?
YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I'M JUST FEELING...
LIKE I DON'T QUITE BELONG.
NO, NO.
BUT I'M FINE.
REALLY I AM.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
SHOULD I CALL DR. STEVENS ?
NO, NO, NO.  NO, NO.
I JUST OVERDID IT, THAT'S ALL.
I'LL GET A CAR
TO TAKE YOU HOME, OKAY ?
THANK YOU.
MR. SPEAKER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.  CHAMPAGNE ?
THAT WAS QUITE A SPEECH.
YOU HEARD THAT ?  I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET CARRIED AWAY.
YOUR WORDS MEANT
A GREAT DEAL TO ME.
YOU SEE, AS IT HAPPENS,
I HAVE A SON WITH AN
INOPERABLE TUMOR OF THE BRAIN.
OH, MY GOD !
I'M SO SORRY, SIR.
MUST'VE BEEN IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS,
KNOWING YOU WERE HERE, BUT I
NEVER MEANT FOR YOU TO OVERHEAR.
NO, NO,
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
GAVE ME A LOT
TO THINK ABOUT.
IN FACT, IT GAVE ME
A DIFFERENT VIEW
OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT.
MR. SPEAKER, COULD I OFFER YOU
A GLASS OF BRANDY
IN MY OFFICE UPSTAIRS ?
I WAS 50
WHEN BILLY WAS BORN.
DIDN'T KNOW IF I WANTED
ANOTHER KID SO LATE.
BUT NOW I LOVE HIM
SO DAMN MUCH.
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD DO FOR BILLY,
ONLY IT WAS HIGHLY ILLEGAL,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER IT ?
OF COURSE I WOULD.
THAT'S THE SAME KIND
OF HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION--
NO, NO,
DON'T ANSWER SO FAST.
YOU'D BE FACING A MANDATORY
MINIMUM SENTENCE OF 40 YEARS
IF IT EVER CAME OUT.
BUT WOULD HE BE CURED ?
HE'D BE EXACTLY THE SAME
AS HE WAS BEFORE.
PERFECT HEALTH.
HE'D NEVER EVEN HAVE
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
BUT IF THE SECRET EVER DID
COME OUT WITH THE LAW
THE WAY IT IS NOW,
HE'D BE PUT TO SLEEP
LIKE A RABID DOG.
HE'D BE DESTROYED
JUST LIKE A RACEHORSE
WITH A BROKEN LEG.
AND IF IT NEVER CAME OUT ?
OR IF THE LAWS WERE CHANGED
ONE DAY ?
THEN BILLY WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
PLEASE, I BEG YOU,
GO TO MY HOUSE AND PICK UP
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.
BECAUSE IF I GO BACK THERE,
THEY WILL KILL THEM BOTH.
-YOU MADE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
POLICE REPORT AN HOUR AGO.
-NO, I DIDN'T.
ACCORDING TO THIS, YOU DID.
AND THEY CHECKED
YOUR THUMBPRINT.
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
THE CLONE.

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
MY HAIR TREATMENTS COST ?
HOW MUCH
DOES GIBSON KNOW ?
HE KNOWS HE'S BEEN CLONED.
HE KNOWS WE'LL KILL ANYONE
WHO SEES THEM TOGETHER.
WHAT'S THAT ?  WHAT ?

ABOUT KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE ?

FRESH AIR WILL DO YOU GOOD.
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE OPENLY
DISMISSIVE OF THE PROPOSAL.
THIS AMOUNTS
TO AN ATTEMPT BY MICROSOFT
TO BUY A STATE OF THE UNION.
BUT IF HE GOES OFF
HIS MEDICATION, PARANOID
DELUSIONS COME BACK.
...VERY SAD,
BECAUSE AT OTHER TIMES
HE SEEMS ALMOST RATIONAL.
GIBSON ?  GIBSON !
- YOU'RE DEAD.
- NO, YOU'RE DEAD.
TRY TO STAY DEAD THIS TIME.
HANK, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU ?
I WAITED FOR OVER
A HALF AN HOUR AT KELLY'S.
IT'S NOW FIVE PAST SEVEN.
I'M HEADING HOME, OKAY ?
WHOA, WHOA.  HE'S FINE.
HE'S OKAY.  HE'S OUR ASSOCIATE.
GIBSON MUST'VE KNOCKED HIM OUT.
KNOCKED HIM OUT ?
HE LOOKS DEAD TO ME, DOC.

OR SHOULD I JUST TAKE
THIS OFF RIGHT NOW ?
NO, NO, NO.
HOLD YOUR HORSES.
OH, HANK. I THINK IT'S SO SEXY
WHEN YOU GO RIGHT TO THE CHAIR.
I KNOW YOU DO.
OH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

AH, AH, AH. CAREFUL

HOLD ON, PLEASE.
HAVE THEY BEEN HERE ?
WHO ?
HELLO, ADAM.
WOULD YOU LIKE A BEER ?
I'M SORRY
I MISSED THE PARTY, BUT...
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S 11:00
AND I WOUND UP AT KELLY'S.
YOU MISSED MY PARTY ?
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
DO IT ON PURPOSE.
IT WAS SORT OF WEIRD.
I REALLY FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU FEEL TERRIBLE ?
I LOST MY WIFE, MY DAUGHTER,
MY WHOLE GODDAMN LIFE TONIGHT.
- I'M GONNA DO
MY SPECIAL DANCE.
- HANK, LISTEN.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
HEY, NOT NOW, CUPCAKE, I CAN'T--
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SHH !
THAT'S A REAL GUN.
SHH !
WHAT'S GOING--
SHH !
JESUS CHRIST !  WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, KILL MY CAT ?
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ?
IF YOU WEREN'T AT MY PARTY,
THEN YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM.
WHO'S "HIM" ?
JESUS H. CHRIST, I SAID
GET YOUR DOG CLONED,
NOT YOURSELF.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ?
I'M GONNA TAKE MY LIFE BACK.
WHAT, YOU'RE
GONNA KILL HIM ?
WHY NOT ?  HE'S NOT REAL.
PLUS, THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST IT.
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS,
ARE YOU ?
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
BUT LOOK AT HIM.
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.
TECHNICALLY, THIS COULD BE
COMMITTING SUICIDE.
BUT HE IS NOT ME.
HE IS NOT EVEN HUMAN.
WAIT A SEC.
HOW DO I KNOW HE'S NOT YOU
AND YOU'RE NOT HIM ?
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM,
HE'S EVEN A SHITTY CARPENTER.
WELL, LET ME SEE YOUR CHIN.
MY CHIN ?
YEAH, YOU CUT YOURSELF
SHAVING, RIGHT ?
ALL RIGHT, HERE.
OKAY, IT'S THERE.
YOU'RE YOU.
SHH !
ADAM.
I COULDN'T DO IT.

I HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.
IS CLARA ASLEEP ?
OH, YES SHE IS.

CIGARS MAKE YOU FEEL.
OOH.
DADDY ?

OH, I'LL TAKE YOU BACK
TO BED, OKAY ?  COME ON.
FIREMAN.
FIREMAN, RIGHT.
- WAIT HERE.
- OKAY.
CIGAR, SIR ?
I CAN'T WAIT.
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ?
MMM, THIS IS SO GOOD.
YOU WANT TO TRY SOME ?
NO.  YOU KNOW, SMOKING'S
ILLEGAL AND I'M A MOTHER.
SWEETHEART,
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THE REPET.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY.
DAD, DID OLIVER DIE ?
IS HE A REPET ?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?
YOU LOCKED HIM OUTSIDE.
I DID ?  I'M SO SORRY, BUT
I HAVEN'T BEEN MYSELF LATELY.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GO TO SLEEP NOW, OKAY ?
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE DID IT
IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR ?
WELL, WE SHOULD
SMOKE CIGARS MORE OFTEN.
MR. GIBSON.
WHO ARE YOU ?
MILLENNIUM SECURITY.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT--
- GOT ANY I.D. ?
- OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY I WAS A LITTLE JUMPY,
BUT WE HAD A BREAK-IN TONIGHT.
WE KNOW.  WE HEARD ON THE WIRE
YOUR CAR WAS FOUND IN THE RIVER.
I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY FOUND
THAT BASTARD THAT STOLE IT ?
- HEY, HEY, WHOA, WHOA.
- RELAX.  HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.
-
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
- NICE 'DO.
HE'S JUST HERE TO HELP ME
FIX THE GARAGE.  OLIVER, HEEL !
NOW WHAT ?
GO SEE.
SORRY, BUT HE'S A REPET.
HE USED TO BE A GOOD WATCHDOG.
NOW, HE LETS MY CAR GET STOLEN
AND HE BARKS AT SECURITY GUARDS.
I HATE CLONES.
WELL, SIR, WE'LL KEEP
AN EYE ON YOUR PROPERTY.
- I'M GONNA SLEEP MUCH BETTER
KNOWING YOU GUYS ARE AROUND.
- YOU TRY TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
TAKE IT EASY.
COME ON, LET'S HIDE.
STOP IT, OLIVER.
STOP IT.
GEE, YOU'RE GLITCHY
TODAY.  COME ON.
GOOD OLIVER.
THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
WAIT, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THEM
HERE WITH THAT-THAT THING.
THOSE WERE THE GUYS
THAT WERE TRYING
TO KILL ME.
IT'S DANGEROUS
FOR NATALIE AND CLARA
IF I HANG AROUND HERE.
DARLING,
YOU'RE STILL AWAKE ?
I WANTED TO WAIT UP FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND I WANTED TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH THESE FLOWERS.
I SEE.
IT TOOK ME 17 GENERATIONS
TO GET THIS RIGHT.
WELL, IF YOU TOLD ME
WHAT YOU WANTED--
OH, I KNOW.
YOU COULD HAVE ENGINEERED IT
IN HALF AN HOUR.
YES.
I'M NOT IN THAT MUCH
OF A HURRY, GRIFFIN.
WANT TO GET A CUP OF TEA
AND THEN GO UPSTAIRS ?
OKAY ?
YEAH.  YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
LET'S DO THAT.
YEAH.  DEAR.
OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
SHH.  JUST STAY CALM.
STAY VERY, VERY CALM.
WHAT A NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE LONGEST
NIGHT IN MY LIFE.
HELLO, ADAM.
I'M A ONE-MAN VIRTUAL GIRL.
BUT IF YOU INSERT
THE INSTALLATION DISK--
OKAY.  NOTHING.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ?
I FELT FINGERS
GOING FOR MY ZIPPER.
NOW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING ?
I HAD TO TOTALLY LOOK AWAY
WHEN YOU AND NATALIE--
THE, UH--
YOU WANT A BEER ?
YOU SAW THE CLONE DO SOMETHING
WITH NATALIE WHILE I TOOK
CLARA INTO THE HOUSE ?
THEY DID NOTHING.
COME ON.  THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE ?
I WOULD HAVE--
- NOTHING.
- WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.
YOU KNOW, NOTHING.
SHIT.
IN THE GODDAMN MINIVAN.
IN THE MINIVAN.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT TOBACCO DOES TO PEOPLE.
- HE SMOKED MY STOGIE TOO ?
- THE BASTARD.
- OH, THAT SON OF A BITCH.
- SON OF A BITCH.
SMOKED YOUR STOGIE.
AND SHE COULDN'T
TELL IT WASN'T ME ?
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT.
SHE SEEMED, UH, HAPPY.
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
SEEING HER WITH HIM.
I SHOULD'VE KILLED THAT SON OF
A BITCH WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE.
AT LEAST SHE'S NOT CHEATING--
- HANK !
- DON'T MOVE !
- TRIPP.
- I'M NOT AFTER YOU.
BACK AWAY.
- BACK AWAY !
- WHY DID YOU DO THAT ?
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID NOW.
THAT'S AS FAR AS YOU GO.
IS THAT YOU, HANK ?
HANK.
HEY, ADAM.  IS HANK SLEEPING
ON THE FLOOR AGAIN ?
THAT'S SO CUTE.
ON THE SIX--  ON THE SIXTH DAY,
GOD CREATED MAN.
ON THE SIXTH DAY--
ON THE SIXTH DAY,
GOD CREATED MAN.  GOD CREATED
MAN ON THE SIXTH DAY.
WHY THE HELL DID YOU
KILL MY FRIEND ?
HANK MORGAN WAS
AN ABOMINATION TO GOD.
HE WAS A CLONE.
HANK WAS NO CLONE.
THE REAL HANK MORGAN
DIED THIS AFTERNOON.
I KNOW BECAUSE I KILLED HIM...
SO I COULD KILL DRUCKER.
DRUCKER'S NOT DEAD.
IT WOULD BE ALL OVER THE NEWS.
OPEN YOUR EYES.
DRUCKER'S A CLONE.
DR. WEIR CLONED DRUCKER.
DR. WEIR CLONED YOUR FRIEND.
DR. WEIR CLONED YOU.
THEY FOUND US.
THEY FOUND US.
- SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD.
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?
WE HAVE PEOPLE AT WEIR'S LAB.
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
IF THEY SCAN MY BRAIN,
THEY'LL BE KILLED.
SHOOT ME !
GOD FORGIVE ME.
