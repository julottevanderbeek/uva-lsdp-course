I'm glad that Shen Long
has finally appeared,
but there's something strange
about this, isn't there?
Look, the sky hasn't
turned dark, or anything.
This certainly is different
from the way it usually is, huh?
Rise, Son Goku.
G- Goku-sa!
C- Chichi...? Ah, well
if it ain't Shen Long!
I put all of them away!
You understand why the Evil
Dragons appeared, yes?
Yeah.
This World and the Next
World becoming one,
as well as the dead returning to life...
Sure enough, that was also because
the Dragon Balls had gone funny.
It seems that you have relied too heavily
upon the power of the Dragon Balls.
I cannot allow you to use
the Dragon Balls any further.
I will remove the Dragon Balls from
before you. I will do the same of myself.
Okay, gotcha, Shen Long! But could
you grant one last wish for me first?
What is it?
As a result of all of this, a
lot of people on Earth have died.
But if the reason for that
lies with the Dragon Balls,
they all had nothing to do with it.
So, could you bring them all back to life?
I want everyone to return
the parts of the Earth
that got messed-up
because of all of this
back to normal together.
All right, understood.
This will be the last time.
Pan!
Gill!
Gill!
Pan, danger! Pan, danger!
But Gill still loves Pan!
Thank you, Shen Long!
Your wish is granted.
Come, let us go, Goku.
Huh? Is it that time already?
Climb on, Goku.
I'll be back in a little while.
Hold on, Kakarrot!
Are you training again?
Kakarrot, are you...?
See you later, Vegeta.
See ya, everybody!
Now see here, Goku-sa! At least
tell us where you're goin' first!
The Dragon Balls, huh? Come to mention it,
everything started when I came across
Son-kun on Mount Paozu, didn't it?
I wonder how long it's been since then.
We sure have been
friends a long time, huh?
Say, Shen Long, I want to stop off
at a few places on the way, okay?
I haven't seen any pichi
pichi gals in a while!
You're just as lecherous
as ever, Muten Roshi-sama.
You dummy! You're the one
who brought this, right?
You know, Kuririn-san, you sure
have died a good number of times.
I'm even more surprised
that you're still alive.
They do say us turtles live for
ten thousand years, after all.
This is incredible!
He really does like that stuff.
He sure does.
Goku!
Goku, he says! What a
dirty old man! Goku?
Heya!
Goku! If it isn't Goku!
I've come back to life again!
By any chance, are you...?
It sure has been a while, huh Kuririn?
And you too, Old Man Turtle Hermit!
Oh, and you too, ''Urigome!''
''Umigame.'' Geez...
So, you're still little, huh?
Mm-hmm. You haven't changed either,
have you Old Timer?
Together like this, it's almost
like we've gone back into the past.
Brings back memories, doesn't it, Goku?
We trained together once, remember?
How we got sent out to search for that
stone that had ''turtle'' written on it,
and stuff?
The one who lost had to
give up supper that night.
And you did nothing but cheat, remember?
That's right! You're just like
you were when you were a kid,
and Muten Roshi-sama is still
the way he's always been...
It's almost like I'm the only one who
got any older... I've changed completely.
Say, Kuririn, you want to go a
round with me, for old time's sake?
Hey now, cut it out! There's no way I
could stand up to you now, is there?
That's okay, come at me!
You're a funny one, all right.
Don't embarrass me too badly!
Goku, are you...?
Just like you were long ago!
You haven't changed a bit, Kuririn!
R- really? Actually, even now,
No. 18 and I sometimes-- huh? Goku?
Where did you go, Goku? Goku! Hey, Goku!
Goku, tell Shen Long thanks
for the Dragon Balls for us.
Let me out of Hell!
How about you quiet down a little?
They say the weaker the dog,
the louder he barks!
What did you say!?
That's our Piccolo-san!
S- Son!
Not too shabby, Piccolo!
W- what are you doing down here!?
Have you come back to Hell?
And after all the trouble I went
to sending you back to Earth!
W- what's this?
It's okay, just shake my hand.
Son, are you...?
I've put you through nothing but trouble,
and I'm sorry I couldn't
pay you back, Piccolo.
I'll never forget you, as long as I live.
Son!
Goku-sa! Are you goin' to
be home in time for dinner!?
Well, well, he's gone. And here I was
goin' to fix a special treat tonight...
He'll be back right away anyhow,
same as he always is.
More importantly, Mom, about this
special treat-- what is it, what is it?
Tonight, we're havin'
Paozu-Newt-on-a-stick!
Wow! That's my favorite!
Well, let's all go home too.
Okay then, everyone, take care!
Mom, hurry home and fix
us that special treat!
Well then, we should be going, too.
Papa, why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?
Sure, I'll come, I'll come!
Pan-chan...
Say, Trunks, do you suppose the
Dragon Balls have really disappeared?
Pan-chan, we're being tested.
From here on, we have to not rely on
anything else, and make this planet--
make the universe a better place,
using our own strength.
Once that is recognized, I'm sure
the Dragon Balls will appear again.
Yeah, sure, huh? Mm-hmm!
Let's do our best!
Come on, let's go home, Pan-chan!
Hold on!
How come? I'm sure that Grandpa
just left together with Shen Long...
Make sure you hold that dear.
Grandpa...
Sure is warm here on Shen Long's back...
We will now hold the Tenkaichi
Tournament Junior Championship Match!
Son Goku-kun!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please direct your view over there!
Son Goku-kun is...
the great-great-great-great-grandson of
both Son Goku-san, who shares his name,
and who long ago, gave us many great
battles here at the Tenkaichi Tournament,
as well as the legendary hero,
Mister Satan!
Huh? Is he serious, Grandma Pan?
I didn't have any idea at all!
Heh heh, surprised?
That weakling Goku...
No wonder he's become so strong.
Which means, Grandma Pan,
that you're...?
That's right. I'm Son Goku's
first-generation granddaughter, Pan-chan.
I can win... I can win... I can win...
Hmph! What a filthy gi!
It's not filthy! This is the gi my
ancestor wore! It's just a little bit old.
T- that boy looks just like
Vegeta-san, doesn't he?
Excuse me...
Are you the boy my son
is fighting's mother?
You're quite old, aren't you?
That's not it at all! I'm the
boy's great-great-grandmother!
Oh, no wonder. I'm so sorry.
Unfortunately, my boy looks like he's
the one who is going to take the victory.
President, the conference is about
to begin. Please return at once.
Hush! The best part is about to begin!
Capsule Corporation... that's the
trademark from Bulma-san's place!
So that's it, that's
what's going on, huh?
This is about to get interesting!
Goku! Don't worry about a thing!
Give that kid an out-and-out,
through-and-through pounding!
Begin!
A- awesome...!
What kind of kids are these?
You betcha! The descendents of Grandpa
Goku and Vegeta-san are fighting.
Even I'm excited about this!
You handle yourself pretty well, huh?
You're the first one that ever
made me go seriously against them.
That goes for me, too!
Whoa, this is a surprise!
You can turn blond, too?
This looks like it's going to
turn out to be a good match!
Here goes!
Get him! Let him have it!
That's the way, Goku!
Go! Goku!
Grandpa?
Excuse me, let me pass!
I beg your pardon!
Look! That boy over there won!
You came, didn't you, Grandpa Goku?
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little, I'm being
charmed by your dazzling, smiling face.
Because of you, Goku, it has been fun.
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.
{\a6}Hold my hand.
{\a6}When I first came across you,
{\a6}I recalled a place that,
when I was a child, I held dear.
{\a6}Won't you dance with me, on the
Winding Road of light and shadow?
{\a6}Even now, are you lost
in thought over him?
{\a6}There are times when I get so that I
want to look back, just a little bit,
{\a6}but holding on to love,
courage and pride, I fight on!
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little,
I'm being charmed,
{\a6}this planet's last remnant of hope.
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,
{\a6}look at me, I'm in love with you!
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.
{\a6}Hold your hand.
{\a6}I like you, even when you're tired,
or wearing an angry face,
{\a6}but I wonder if you're okay,
living as hurried as you are.
{\a6}Here I am, twisted around by your
indifferent manner, feeling Sea Side Blue.
{\a6}Even so, are you lost
in thought over him?
{\a6}There are still other things
I wanted to ask you,
{\a6}but our dialogue is drowned
out by the sound of the car,
{\a6}and drifts out into the street.
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little, I'm being
charmed, it's strange, even to me,
{\a6}how when anything comes up,
I want to call you right away.
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,
Goofy and cheerful...
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,
{\a6}in the end, you're the
only one I ever saw.
Yoo-hoo!
{\a6}Let's spring out
toward the distant sea.
and gentle...
{\a6}Let's spring out
toward the distant sea.
{\a6}Hold your hand.
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little,
I'm being charmed,
{\a6}this planet's last remnant of hope.
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.
That's the Goku we all loved.
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,
{\a6}look at me, I'm
in love with you!
This is where the story of Dragon Ball ends.
{\a6}look at me, I'm
in love with you!
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.
{\a6}Hold my hand.
