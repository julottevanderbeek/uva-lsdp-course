Come, come.
You have authorization
to dress him like that?
Oh, yes, sir.
Circus ape, huh?
The only one ever to have been
trained as a bareback rider
in the entire history of the circus.
Circuses are past history .
Not while I live and breathe.
Go ahead, Senor Armando.
Thank you.
Come, come.
Come, come.
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.
But walk more like
a primitive chimpanzee.
Your arms should move
from the shoulder, like so.
Yes, that's better.
After 20 years,
you've picked up evolved habits from me.
That could be dangerous.
Even fatal.
Armando, I don't understand.
Caesar, there can be only one
talking chimpanzee on Earth,
the child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,
who came from the future
and were brutally murdered
for fear that one very distant day
apes might dominate the human race.
But outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.
We must keep it that way.
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.
- I--
- Shh!
Come, come.
Attention.
This is the watch commander.

But how did it happen?
Shh.
Go!
Go!
No!
No!
Aah!
Go.
You go.
But you said humans
treated apes like pets.
They did, in the beginning.
- They've made slaves of them.
- Shh!
They all died eight years ago,
every dog and cat in the world.
It was like a plague.
The disease that killed them
was a mysterious virus
brought back from outer space
by one of the astronauts.
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- No, no, we were immune.
And so were simians,
even the smallest.
That's how it began--
humans wanting little pets
to replace those they'd lost.
When people realized
how quick they were to learn,
how easy to train,
the pets became larger and larger
until now...
It's monstrous.
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.
Yes, Lisa.
A Young Queen Falls
for Mrs. Riley.
No!
Lisa.
Yes?
Could you be so kind
as to display it in your window?
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.
Attention.
The labor demonstration
on the south plaza
will be terminated in 10 minutes.
Repeat.
The labor demonstration

Now that I know
they won't kill me,
I don't enjoy them.
Well, for heaven's sakes, a circus.
Home, Lisa.
Yes?
Oh, I was wondering,
would you be kind enough
to display these posters?
Stop it!
No, Zelda.
Home, Zelda.
I'm sorry , Mrs. Riley.
I'll comb you out in a minute.
I want to be combed out now.
I have to go to a luncheon.
Thursday, then.
Thursday.
Oh, I'm out of raisins.
- Take mine.
- Thank you.
Why stir 'em into something like that?
The pigment is in synthetic alloy.
You're over tipping.
Yeah, but it'll come back.
No!
No, no!
I told them to condition them to fire.
Attention, attention.
The labor demonstration

What's his job?
He's a messenger.
For the governor, so get!
Hyah! Get!
Go! Go!
Otto, no!
Otto, no, no.
-
- Otto, no, no.
- Otto, no.
-
Stop this at once, all of you!
Mr. MacDonald, we were just--
I saw what you were doing. Sedate
the animal and get him out of here.
Who's that?
MacDonald, the governor's
number-one assistant.
He love apes or something?
Don't it figure?
Hold him, Bill.
Aah!
Lousy human bastards!
Who said that?
I did.
He's a performing ape for my circus.
- A talking ape?
- No!
That's impossible.
It was I who spoke.
Didn't sound like you.
Yell "lousy human bastards."
That's not what I said.
That's what I heard.
Yell "lousy human bastards!"
Lousy human bastards.
We said yell!
Lousy human bastards!
- Yeah. Yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.
That's right.
The ape spoke.
No, they're mistaken.
I admit my behavior was inexcusable,
and I am deeply sorry , but--
- We better take him to headquarters.
- You're right.
Otto, no!
No! Otto, no!
Move him out.
Oh, Armando, forgive me.
Oh, no, no. You only said out loud
what I was thinking.
I'm sorry .
I was so angry .
I might have bluffed it through
if you hadn't run away.
Now they'll suspect
you're understanding all that was said.
Armando,
let's go back to the circus.
No, no, no.
Please.
That's the first place they'll look.
Here's what we'll do.
- I'll go to the police.
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's the only way.
I'll say I couldn't find you,
that, uh, you've run away before,
that big cities frighten you.
- But where would I go?
- You wait right here.
- If this works,
I'll be back by nightfall.
- But what if it doesn't?
- What if they don't let you go?
- They will. They will.
But just in case,
if I am not back by then,
these steps go down to a tunnel
that leads to the harbor.
Cargoes of apes
are frequently unloaded at night.
You must infiltrate
one of them.
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked.
- You'll have to
get rid of these clothes.
- I don't want to.
We must have an alternate plan.
Don't you see?
Right now,
the only safe hiding place for you
is among your own kind.
I shouldn't be long.
Why would you say "human"?
That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.
I didn't say "human," Mr. Governor.
I said "inhuman."
"Lousy inhuman bastards."
And by the blessed St. Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.
I run a circus, and--
- We know that.
- From 20 years back.
From the year, Senor Armando,
when the two talking apes
arrived and conceived a baby
whose survival could have threatened
the future of the entire human race.
Mr. Governor, it's my understanding
the baby was shot dead.
Or so it was believed.
However, ever since this morning
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.
They could have switched their baby
with one from a zoo.
Or perhaps a circus.
Surely you can't be serious.
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.
This is a recording
of the recommendations
made to the then president
of the United States
by the chairman of
the presidential committee.
We believe that the talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,
have come from the future.
We believe their spoken testimony
thatsome2,000yearshence,
their descendants will have
all but exterminated the human race.
The female ape
is now pregnant with child.
The commission therefore recommends
that the ape child's birth
should be prevented,
and that both the male and the female
should be rendered incapable
of begetting another.
But, Mr. Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,
and every circus,
including my own.
Where a small chimpanzee was found.
The only chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus,
and legally certified
to have been born
a month before the talking apes
arrived on earth.
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew.
- I've searched everywhere.
- Senor Armando!
Let me remind you
of the seriousness
of our problem.
Now, your circus travels
mainly in the provinces?
Yes, sir.
Undoubtedly, you are unaware
of the rising tide of disobedience
and outright defiance
among the servant apes
in our cities.
Mr. Governor, many of the reported
offenses have been proved minor.
That ape who was killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,
would you call his offense minor?
No, I would not.
He physically assaulted his own master.
But only after what must
have been severe provocation.
The ape's body was covered
with bruises from a beating.
Which he no doubt richly deserved.
How many more out there
are just like that ape,
all burning with resentment,
all waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence,
with enough will to lead them?
Waiting for an ape
who can think, who can talk.
Senor Armando,
has your ape ever talked
or shown any signs
of being articulate?
Never in my presence
or anyone else's.
You can question my circus hands.
We intend to.
Meanwhile, you will remain in custody.

No!
No!
No!
They're uppity.
I haven't fed them yet.
Come on.
-
-
Switch off.
Switch on.
Have you seen this ape before?
Isn't that Cornelius?
I thought you didn't know him.
You told me yourself--
the talking ape that was murdered.
Executed.
Executed.
- Would you say there's a resemblance?
- Oh, no.
Look very carefully.
Like father, like son, eh?
No.
- No!
-
You'd do well to
cooperate with us.
Could I please have
a glass of water?
Do.
No!
Do.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Do.
Attention, Training Control, four
females have arrived for insemination--
three gorillas, one chimpanzee.
Please select four superior males--
three gorillas, one chimpanzee--
and send them
to the breeding annex immediately.
Yes, ma'am, for immediate sale.
One male gorilla, age 7,
fully conditioned bed-maker, grade-A.
Yes. You will be
credited after auction.
You're a member of Breck's party?
That's how you got those contracts.
He's good for this country ,
good for all of us.
You think he'll make it,
don't you?
I don't know of anyone
who could stop him.
Bring up lot eight.
Lot eight, one male chimpanzee,
in early prime
and perfect physical condition.
Take a look at this specimen.
This has to be
the buy of the afternoon.
Early prime.
Perfect physical condition.
Under observation, he appeared
so familiar, obedient, docile,
and intelligent with humans,
that conditioning
was not considered necessary .
But it can be provided on request.
We're going to start the bidding
on this specimen at $800.
What am I bid on this superb specimen?
The bidding starts at 800.
What am I bid
for this superb specimen?
- 800.
- 850.
Do I hear 9?
I hear 9.
- 950.
- 950.
on the end.
- 1 ,1 00.
- 1 ,1 00.
- 1 ,1 50.
- 1 ,1 50.
Going, going...
- Buy him.
- 1 ,500.
for His Excellency,
Governor Breck.
Going, going, gone.
Come.
That's very good, Morgan,
but simplify the wording.
Where's that IQ breakdown?
We've just received this disappointing
report on the automated sanitation plan.
You have a meeting at 1 2:00.
Cancel it.
These figures seem inflated.
Did you double-check them?
- Yes, sir.
- Then triple-check them.
No. Come.
Hold all calls, Miss Greer.
Here's the IQ profile on all apes
tested in the last four weeks.
It's risen by 3 2/3 points.
Show that to Mr. MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.
I assembled that data, Morgan.
You summarized the wrong part.
As a result, their work output
has increased about the same percentage,
which I thought the governor
might regard as good news.
We'll go over that later.
No.
Watch.
Do.
No, no, no.
Clean, clean.
The little fellow's
not so bright after all.
No, but then brightness
has never been encouraged among slaves.
Oh, don't be so touchy,
Mr. MacDonald.
All of us were slaves once,
in one sense of the word or another.
We can send him back
for reconditioning.
That isn't necessary .
You're quite right,
Mr. MacDonald,
but not for any of your
bleeding-heart reasons.
Reconditioning.
That's all you ever think of.
If we took every ape who muffed
an assignment or disobeyed an order
and sent him back
for reconditioning,
Ape Management would become
impossibly overcrowded.
It's the only thing
that has any effect.
-Just makes them worse.
- Some of them couldn't be worse.
I've been having
a comprehensive list compiled.
- Mr. Governor?
- Yes? What is it?
- It's time for your meeting
with the defense council.
- I'll be along in a moment.
- Defense council?
- I'll tell you all about it later.
Has this anything to do
with the list you just mentioned?
You'll be given full details.
Meanwhile, we're going to recondition
this little fellow ourselves.
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr. Breck.
Well, I'm going to revive
a charming tradition
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife
and let you name yourself.
Caesar.
A king.
Yes?
They're waiting for you
in the council chamber.
We'll never make a bartender
out of Caesar.
Have him detailed
to the command post.
No.
Attention. There are reports of
unescorted apes in the plaza.
Investigate.
No, no, when you're deciphering,
the internal indicator
is the second code.
- It hasn't been declassified yet.
- Can I help you?
This ape's been assigned
to the command post.
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.
- Start him off in the files.
Low priority traffic.
- Yes, sir.
First check the priority,
then the action addressee.
Do.
Lisa.
Lisa!
Ah, Senor Armando.
Guards, you may go.
- This way, Senor.
- Sit down, sit down.
We have good news for you.
Good news?
Yes.
You're to be released.
Inspector Hoskyns and I have come to
believe that your ape is not the child
of the two talking chimpanzees.
You found him?
Not yet, but he'll turn up.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Please forgive us.
It was unavoidable.
Oh, yes, yes.
Then I'm free to go?
As soon as you sign
this sworn declaration.
What does it say?
Only what you've been saying-- that the
circus ape is incapable of human speech
and to the best of your knowledge
has never uttered a word.
- Certainly.
- Excellent.
We'll check this with the authenticator.
Then you'll be free to go.
- The, uh, authenticator?
- Oh, it's just a formality.
Sit back down, please.
It'll just take a moment.
What does the authenticator do?
It makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.
You said the first time you heard
the name Cornelius was in this office.
Was that true?
No.
Now, there.
You see?
But that's not really
a mark against you.
You most probably heard it
somewhere else before.
Now, about your statement,
sworn statement,
that the circus ape
is incapable of speech.
No.
I won't submit to this.
You will.
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!
Sit back, please.
No. No.
- Guard!
- No!
No.
Hell no!
I knew that circus owner was lying!
- He fell to his death accidentally.
- While trying to escape.
He knew he'd been exposed.
Aah!
Attention. Attention.
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody
a number of servant apes
from households throughout the city
who had gathered clan destinely
in the unused building
on the outskirts
of the east sector.
Property owners are firmly warned
that they bearsole responsibility
for the behavior and whereabouts
of their servant apes.
Frank.
Frank.
-
- No!
"One dozen steaks, New York cut,
for Mrs. Van Thal."
Yeah, OK.
Add one gallon ofk--
No.
Two...
gallons...
of kerosene.
Mr. Governor,
the latest ape disobedience figures.
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.
It couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr. MacDonald.
Arrange for distribution
of the Achilles' List,
copies to each police precinct.
Details are to be left
to the individual commanders,
but I want every ape on that list
rounded up and delivered to
the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry , 309.
The cages are full.
We cannot accommodate any new intakes
until after Tuesday's auction.
I repeat that.
After Tuesday's auction.
"Collect one repaired Colt .45."
Add...
The Achilles' List,
referring to our Achilles' heel,
contains the name of every ape
who over the past year
has been guilty of overt disobedience.
- The charge against them is nonsense.
- It will do for my purposes.
They constitute the hard core of our
problem, and I'm going to crush them.
You will only further
aggravate the problem.
This action is folly,
and I wish to protest it
in the strongest possible terms.
Very well, Mr. MacDonald.
Your protest has been duly noted.
From now on, you have one assignment--
to find that talking ape.
What is this?
A red alert?
Sort of.
Ape Management computer's
come up with a rather intriguing error.
Shipment 507-l for Indonesia
comprised three orangutans
and one chimpanzee.
So?
There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.
Yes, sir. One moment.
State Security Chief Inspector Kolp
on line three.
Yes, Inspector?
Give me the Indonesian file
for last month.
That's 507 ex-Borneo.
Right, Inspector.
Let me check.
Yes, sir.
That chimpanzee was sold
to Governor Breck.
Just as I first thought!
We've had him under our noses
all the time!
I'll have the ape executed immediately
on your verbal orders alone.
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.
Get Mr. MacDonald
at the command post.
Suppose he won't speak?
I don't understand.
What the chief inspector means is,
there'd still be a doubt.
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.
We'd like to close the file.
You shall.
I promise you.
Reconditioning applications
are made in triplicate.
A disturbance in the north plaza?
What kind of disturbance?
MacDonald speaking.
Yes, sir.
You want me to turn
Caesar over to Kolp?
He's on your Achilles' List?
Mr. MacDonald,
do not question an order.
No, I'm not questioning the orders.
I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.
Yes, sir.
I'll do just as you say.
Come.
No, this goes
to Traffc Control!
Take it easy.
They can't read.
Not yet, they can't.
Do!
Mr. MacDonald,
are you near a phone?
Mr. MacDonald,
it is imperative
that you get to a phone.
Come in, Mr. MacDonald.
Do you hear me?
Get to a phone and come in.
Now come in.
Yes, Mr. Governor?
Kelp is on his way.
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir.
- I'll keep a lookout.
- Notify me the moment he's handed over.
Yes, sir.
I wish...
I wish there was some way we could
communicate so you'd understand that l--
I understand,
Mr. MacDonald.
Yes, l--
I'm the one they're looking for.
I never believed it.
I thought you were a myth.
Well, I'm not.
But I will tell you
something that is.
The belief that
human beings are kind.
No, Caesar.
There are some--
A handful, perhaps, but not most.
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.
We can't do that
until we are free.
How do you propose
to gain this freedom?
By the only means left to us--
revolution.
But it's doomed to failure.
Perhaps.
- This time.
- And the next.
- Maybe.
- But you'll keep trying.
You above every one else
should understand.
We cannot be free
until we have power.
How else can we achieve it?
Go!
Mr. MacDonald, I have an order to have
the ape Caesar taken into custody.
I know.
I've been looking for him.
- He's not in the command post?
- No.
Issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes.
I still don't see why
he made a run for it.
It's really quite simple.
The ape has intelligence.
He learned Armando was dead.
He assumed the man
betrayed him under torture.
But we don't do that to humans.
Now.
Talk!
Talk!
Aah! Aah!
Talk!
Talk!
Talk!
Aah!
H...H...Have...
Have pity.
That's incredible.
Well, there's your proof.
We're convinced, Mr. Governor.
It's fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
Have it say something else.
You heard the governor.
Answer!
- We could persuade him.
- No.
He's not responsible for what he is.
Still, seeing him there,
it's like looking
at some deadly bacillus
and knowing you've got it
bottled up at last.
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.
I have authorization here from the
governor to have this beast destroyed.
I'll notify the vet.
He is wired for electrocution,
isn't he?
- Yes.
- Well, then electrocute him now.
Aaaaaah!
- He's dead.
- Good.
Very good work, Inspector.
What happened to Mr. MacDonald?
I'm afraid his sensibility--
Ah, there you are.
- Is it over?
- Yes.
It's over.
Shall we go back to work?
Lisa.
All keepers and handlers,
attention, attention.
All keepers and handlers.
There's $50,000 worth of apes
in jeopardy.
Get them out of here alive.
Ohh!
Yes!
Commander, I understand the situation.
Assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them.
Order full mobilization
of all security forces--
police, militia
and reserve defense units.
Cordon off every entrance to the city.
Our control method is to include
tear gas and sedation darts?
There will be but one control method--
shoot to kill.
A small group of apes
scheduled for intensivere conditioning
have escaped from Ape Management.
Until they've been
rounded up by police,
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors.
A further announcement will be made
as soon as recapture is effected.
I guess here it is.
Ape Management
is in the hands of the apes.
Many officials are either dead
or held hostage.
The main band of rioting apes are at
this very moment marching on the city.
It's been established that the ape mob
is under the command of
a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee
who has...
acquired the power of speech.
That idiot!
Get out a retraction immediately!
Announce that the talking ape
has been apprehended and put to death.
...the child of the two talking
chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira,
who came to us from outer space
As such, he constitutes a threat
to the future to the whole human race.
Governor Breck has just issued
this order to all civilians.
Go to your homes.
Stay in your home
and lock your doors.
Above all, do not panic.
Repeat. Go to your homes,
stay in your homes
and lock your doors.
The situation can be controlled
provided our defense forces
are given complete freedom of movement.
No!
Go back!
No!
No!
Go home!
Back!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Ready!
Aim!
- Fire!
-
Ready! Aim--
Yes.
Yes.
Understood.
Riot control reports that the apes
have broken through the outer cordon.
Advance units are approaching the plaza.
Order units four and six
into action immediately.
Riot control.
No!
No!
They've reached the plaza.
Good God!
They're armed!
And organized.
No! Home!
Don't plead with them, you idiot!
Ready!
No! Home!
Home!
Home!
Aim!
Fire!
What's the trouble down there?
Like wild animals,
they're smelling blood.
-
- No! No!
Get him off.
Get him off.
My God! There's more!
- They're inside the building.
- No!
- Alert all inner security posts.
- Right, sir.
The circuits are dead.
Take a message.
"To Riot Control. Urgent.
"Command Post under attack.
Repeat.
Command Post under attack."
It won't work, sir.
- No!
-
But how? They don't have
the intelligence to use such tools.
-
- Shoot them! Shoot them all!
-
- This is a communication center.
There's no defense here!
If we lose this battle, that's
the end of the world as we know it!
We will have proved
ourselves inferior, weak!
And all those groveling cowards
who are alive when the battle is over
will be the weakest of all.
This will be the end
of human civilization!
The world will belong
to a planet of apes!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No, go! Go!
Caesar!
Your servant.
Your creature.
Your animal!
But I saw you die!
The king is dead.
Long live the king!
Tell me, Breck, before you die--
how do we differ from the dogs and cats
you and your kind used to love?
Why did you turn us
from pets into slaves?
Because your kind
were once our ancestors.
Man was born of the ape.
There's still an ape
curled up inside of every man,
the beast that must be
whipped into submission,
the savage
that has to be shackled in chains.
You are that beast, Caesar.
You taint us.
You... You poison our guts.
When... we hate you, we're...
we're hating the dark side of ourselves.
Aah!
Take him.
Go!
Caesar!
Caesar, this is not how it was to be.
In your view or mine?
Violence prolongs hate.
Hate prolongs violence.
By what right are you spilling blood?
By the slave's right
to punish his persecutors.
Caesar, l, a descendant of slaves,
am asking you to show humanity.
But I was not born human.
I know--
the child of the evolved apes.
Whose children shall rule the earth.
For better or for worse?
Do you think it could be worse?
Do you think this riot
will win freedom for your kind?
- By tomorrow--
- By tomorrow it will be too late!
Why, a tiny, mindless insect
like the emperor moth
can communicate with another
over a distance of80 miles.
An emperor ape might do slightly better?
Slightly.
What you have seen here today,
apes on the five continents
will be imitating tomorrow.
With knives against guns?
With kerosene cans
against flame throwers?
Where there is fire, there is smoke.
And, in that smoke,
from this day forward,
my people will crouch
and conspire and plot and plan
for the inevitable day
of man's downfall,
the day when he finally
and self-destructively
turns his weapons against his own kind,
the day of the writing in the sky
when your cities lie buried
under radioactive rubble,
when the sea is a dead sea,
and the land is a wasteland
out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.
We shall build our own cities in which
there will be no place for humans
except to serve our ends.
We shall found our own armies,
our own religion,
our own dynasty.
That day is upon you now!
N-N-N-No!
N-N-N...
But now...
now we will put away our hatred.
Now we will put down our weapons.
We have passed through
the night of the fires,
and those who were our masters
are now our servants!
And we, who are not human,
can afford to be humane.
Destiny is the will of God,
and if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,
it is God's will
that he be dominated with compassion
and understanding.
So cast out your vengeance.
Tonight we have seen
the birth of the planet of the apes!
