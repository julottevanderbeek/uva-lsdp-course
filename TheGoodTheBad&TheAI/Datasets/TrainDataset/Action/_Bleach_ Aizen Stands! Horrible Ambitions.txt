Oh!
Nozomi?
Where am I?
A candy store called Urahara’s Shop.
There’s nothing to worry about.
It’s safe here.
Don’t strain yourself.
Hey!
You looked like you were
having a nightmare.
Are you okay?
Hey! Are you listening?!
What…is this?
Oh, that’s right.
You’ve never seen me like this.
It’s me, Kon!
Hey, why were those guys after you?
Is it because of something you did?
Oh yeah, before we get to that…
You are a Soul Reaper, aren’t you?
You should’ve said so.
Not to brag, but I’m pretty
knowledgeable in that area.
Lame.
That’s right, lame.
Say what?!
I’m not in this form by choice!
I’m a Mod Soul,
so when I can’t use Ichigo’s body,
there’s nothing I can do about it!
A Mod Soul?
T-That’s right.
Wh-What’re you staring at?!
Anyway, answer my questions!
My loyal servants might
be able to help you out.
Perverted freak.
You jerk!
What was that for?!
That’s enough.
But why?!
All I did was ask her questions.
If she doesn’t want to talk,
there’s no use trying
to force it out of her.
But…
Ichigo…
How long are you going to keep
Brother and the others waiting?
Come quickly!
All right. I’ll be right there.
All right then!
Off we go to the strategy meeting!
You stay by her with the others.
What?!
She is being targeted.
We need to take precautions.
But…
It’s an important assignment.
I’m counting on you.
Well, if you say so, Sis.
Let's go, Ichigo.
Yeah.
Be careful!
Nozomi?
Everyone, thank you for taking time
from your busy schedules to come here.
Never mind the formalities.
What’re we going to do from here on?
I’ve already sealed
off the Precipice World
and rendered communications impossible.
We must unite before they can form
a strategy and return here.
There are still a few captains who have
not been replaced with a Reigai.
What’ll we do about the Head Captain?
I have a plan in mind for him.
Of course, I will need
everyone’s help.
I don’t care about that.
I’ll listen to anything you say.
So how about it?
Hurry up and let me fight him!
Oh, how revolting.
Barbarians are so eager to use violence.
What?
Not that I care whom a barbarian
chooses to fight, of course.
Don’t go carving them up too much.
They’re my important test subjects.
What are your thoughts, Captain Kuchiki?
There is only one head
of the Kuchiki Clan.
There is no need for two.
I see.
All your wishes will soon be realized.
Once we have captured that girl.
With these hands,
we will transform the world
into what it should be.
So much trouble for just one girl.
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters
All right, we will now
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters
begin our Soul Reaper
imposter crisis meeting.
Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters
begin our Soul Reaper
imposter crisis meeting.
With your permission,
I will be your host.
Hey!
Huh? What’s the matter, Ichigo?
Do you even need to ask?!
Why’re we in my room?!
Now, now…
Too many interruptions!
Get on with it.
The mastermind is Kageroza Inaba,
Seventh Seat in Squad 12
and a section chief in the
Department of Research and Development.
He controlled and studied
the Precipice World.
In other words, he’s a
Precipice World specialist.
This Precipice World incident
was planned entirely by Kageroza.
He manipulated time
in the Precipice World
so that we would be met by the Cleaner,
he confined us there,
and sent back Reigai versions of
the captains to the Soul Society.
If left unchecked,
the entire Thirteen Court Guard Squads
will be under his control.
How aggravating!
Kageroza…
He lured me to the Soul Society by
manipulating the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.
During that time, he
tried to capture Nozomi.
What is he planning to use Nozomi for?
In all likelihood,
that girl holds some huge secret.
For example,
he may have hidden something
inside that girl’s body.
I won’t allow it.
I’ll never let something
like that happen again!
URAHARA’S SHOP
Mr. Urahara…
Thank you very much
for providing us this barbeque
set and the food too.
Not at all. Don’t mention it.
Let’s enjoy it together later.
A barbeque?
Why?
It appears you’re even
dumber than Kurosaki.
Watch it!
This is Inoue’s way of
trying to cheer her up a bit.
That girl’s been though a lot.
I understand Orihime’s intentions,
but should we be doing something
like this during a crisis?
Actually, this activity could
help her open up to us.
Oh, I see.
Come on, everybody! Let’s get started!
Ishida, would you mind
cutting the vegetables?
Sado, you get the fire started, okay?
Gotcha!
I get it now.
Hey!
What? Goofing off already?
Sorry… This is your welcome party.
Anyway, if no one else, I want
you to tell me the truth.
I’ll help you any way I can.
Even if it’s something you don’t
want to tell the others,
you can tell me, right?
After all, I did save your life!
Huh?!
What’s that?
That thing you’re holding there.
Oh, it’s just chili powder.
Why’re you holding chili powder?
Oh, I see.
You don’t know what
chili powder is, do you?
I’m right, aren’t I?
Okay! Then I’ll teach you!
Chili powder is awfully
spicy if you eat it as-is,
and when you put it directly
into the mouth like that, it’s…
hot!
My mouth is on fire!
Hot!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
H-Huh?
What’s this all about?
Don’t you get it?
You’ve defiled the proud Quincy Cross!
But that’s a shiitake mushroom.
It’s a specially prepared shiitake.
Eat it with the appreciation
it deserves!
Yes, sir.
Trouble!
Nozomi’s gone!
What?!
Nozomi!
Nozomi!
Found her?
No.
Hey! Nozomi!
Where the heck could Nozomi have gone?
Huh?
Nozomi!
Found you.
Hey!
We’ve been looking for you, Nozomi!
Wait, Nozomi. Where are you going?
Come back and let’s
have some barbeque.
It’s delicious!
I don’t want any.
Don’t be like that. Let’s go back.
Everyone’s preparing it just for you.
C’mon, Nozomi.
Let’s go back.
Everyone’s worried.
Not my concern.
What’s with you?!
We’re trying to cheer you up because
we thought you’d be scared
after being targeted!
And you say that’s not your concern?!
Is that how you respond
to people’s kindness?!
Not my concern.
Hey, what are you doing?
What do you want?!
Oh! Rangiku!
W-What’s the matter?
Hear me out, Rangiku!
That chick is cocky, violent, goes off
on her own and doesn’t
listen to people.
We’re trying to look after her,
but she doesn’t appreciate it one bit!
Even I’ve had it with her!
Oh?
I don’t know what’s going on,
but you seem to be having a hard time.
All right. Let me handle this.
Huh?
Girls her age are difficult, you know.
Let me handle this woman-to-woman, okay?
Really?!
That’d be a great help!
Oh, but everyone is looking for Nozomi.
Which means if I go back without her,
they’ll get on my case again.
It’ll be fine.
I’ll convince her to go back.
But, I’m a man.
A man must keep his promise.
Come on.
Huh?
Let me handle this. Please?
She’s all yours!
Come on, Nozomi.
Let’s talk over there.
Come with me.
That’s such a relief.
If that chick were a little more open,
she might even be cute.
But Rangiku, now she’s…
Rangiku…
What about me?
What?!
R-Rangiku… Why’re you—?
Where’s Nozomi?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
I haven’t seen her.
What?
Kon, what’re you doing here?
What’s with him?
L-Let me go.
Let me go! Let me go!
Now then…
Let’s talk on the other side.
Now you’ve done it!
You…
Sorry it took so long, Nozomi!
I saw through your guise
from the very start!
Don’t interfere!
Stop, you imposter!
Damn you!
Nozomi, run!
Imposter?
Who’re you calling an imposter?!
From here on,
we’re the real ones!
H-Hey!
Nozomi… Hurry and get away.
Don’t worry, I’ll
defeat that imposter.
You fool! You can’t…
Nozomi…
I’m sorry…
I left you alone like that.
You…
Too bad.
Did you really think you
could stop me with this?
You sure underestimated me.
Now then… Shall we go, Nozomi?
Stop!
But before that…
You need to be punished
for being a bad girl!
Ichigo!
It ends here.
Give it up, you imposter!
So this is my imposter, huh?
She’s quite a fine woman.
But no match for the original, though.
Growl, Haineko!
She got away.
Hey!
I’m glad you’re okay.
Of course, it’s all thanks
to my awesome feats.
Show some appreciation!
What?
What are you talking about?
This all started because you
took your eyes off of her.
Why did you leave her by
herself in the first place?!
Didn’t Rukia make
it very clear to you?!
Umm…I…umm…
Perverted freak.
No, I…
Kurosaki, Nozomi… The meat is ready!
Okay! I’ll bring it for you!
Jeez…
Don’t worry, Nozomi.
From here on, we’ll protect you.
Are you people stupid?
Who knows?
Nozomi.
Have some barbeque! It’s delicious!
Try it!
This sure turned out to be quite a mess.
Not entirely.
Having two Marechiyo Omaedas would
equate to twice the consumption
of fried rice crackers.
Having two Rangiku Matsumoto would
equate to having two Soul
Reapers who won’t do work,
while having two Kenpachi
Zaraki would equate
to double the destruction
being done. That’s all.
I’ve heard enough.
Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers.
Hear me out, Captain!
My Reigai had a wrinkle right here!
Can you believe they would
go through the trouble
just to add something like
that for a sick joke?!
That’s not true!
I hate to admit it, but
the Reigai he developed
are perfect copies of ourselves!
M-M-Must replenish my
collagen supply with…
meat!
Meat, meat, meat, meat,
My meat!
