JACKIE: I've been following her
for the last two weeks.
Four days ago, she signed up
for a Hong Kong tour to Ukraine.
She's working with a contact,
but we still don't know who he is.
Her name is Natasha Re...
Rekshynski.
- Rekshynski.
-Ahem. Okay.
- Thank you, Jackie. Well done.
-Thank you.
- Bill, I'd like to talk with you a minute.
-Me?
- Okay.
-Excuse me.
Jackie, the CIA guy said you did great work.
They were impressed.
They said you have to work with them again.
When I get a chance, yeah.
All right. So you agree?
You will stay on the case, okay?
You mean, I have to follow her to Ukraine?
Oh, I promise this will be easy.
The CIA have so many people.
Why did they choose me?
They think Natasha's contact may be
suspicious, so they want a new face.
But over there, I don't know
the language or the place.
This is all you have to do:
Follow Natasha onto the plane,
watch her, record her movements...
...and turn your notes over to them
when you arrive. Simple.
- So I just watch her on the plane?
-That's right.
What can she do on a plane?
And that's all I do?
That's almost all you do.
But there's one important thing.
Yeah, take a few days' vacation out there. Ah?
You deserve it.
Let the Ukrainians take care of things.
- Relax and have fun. That's an order.
-Yes, sir.
UNCLE BILL:
Remember to buy me some caviar.
- Good morning.
WOMAN: Good morning.
- Jackie, welcome to the Ukraine.
-Mark.
This is Commander Korda,
Department of Security.
JACKIE: Nice to meet you.
-Did you find anything?
No, but she went to the toilet seven times.
Here's the timetable.
She didn't talk to anyone.
Thanks, Jackie. You're done.
We'll take over from here.
Very good.
One thousand dollars.
MAN: Any other currency?
-No.
Your accommodation is fixed,
your flight is booked for tomorrow...
...and here's some pocket money.
- One billion.
-One billion?
A telephone, dial 01 if you need us.
- Simple, huh?
-Yeah, pretty simple.
Marina will show you to your car.
- Oh, yes.
-Have fun.
It's Line 2.
MAN: Hello?
-Hello, it's Natasha.
It's a tap.
MAN:
Sorry, wrong number.
Hello? Hello.
- They're onto us. Let's go.
MAN: Call the strike force.
WOMAN : Natasha Rekshynski.
Please come to the information desk.
- Thank you.
-Have a good holiday.
JACKIE:
Thank you.
Natasha Rekshynski, come with us.
Take her away.
- Let me go.
-What's going on? She's with my tour.
- It's not your business.
-I can't believe this.
- I'm with the Department of Security.
-I have orders. Talk to my commander.
Bastard.
- They've taken the girl.
-What?
MAN: She's gone.
-Who is his commander?
- Natasha was taken away by the strike force.
-When?
- Huh? Two for 5 million?
-Yes, this is the best there is.
Okay, okay, okay. How much is that?
MAN: Hey.
JACKIE: Huh? Oh.
Thank you.
Follow the car. Follow the car. Quick, quick.
Slow down. The road is closed. Go that way.
MAN:
Natasha. Thank God.
I go and look. You wait.
Okay? Okay-
MAN:
Wait in here, please. You will be warmer.
JACKIE: Mark, I saw Natasha. What happened?
- Where?
She went into a church.
Keep following her. Don't let them see you.
- Try and get a street name and call us.
-Okay, I'll try.
- Major Majenko.
-Tsui.
Your strike force saved Natasha.
Thank you for sending them in.
Your problem is my problem.
Yes, and I got your stuff here.
Excellent
TSUI: All the arrangements have been made,
just as we discussed.
This is for your expenses.
And this is your new passport
with an American visa.
Your money is already
in your Swiss bank account.
Very good.
TSUI: Take the shell apart
and then send them to these addresses.
I'll take the guidance system
and the uranium core with me.
Okay, I've got our insurance. Let's go.
I'll call you. Make sure the money is there.
NATASHA:
Please be careful.
- I love you.
-I love you too.
TSUI:
I'll see you later.
NATASHA:
I'll wait for you there.
JACKIE:
It's me.
I found a new suspect.
MARK: Who is he?
-I don't know.
MARK: Where are you?
- Let me see.
- I can't read the sign.
-Can you spell it out?
Huh?
C-H-l-K-- No, no, no.
Left, right K.
Left and right K.
H-I-K.
JACKIE:
P-A-T-N.
Reverse N.
- We got it. We got it.
-Okay, we're on our way.
Package for Alexander Nevsky.
Thanks.
- Are you going on the slopes today?
-Huh?
- Can I help you?
-Uh...
- Skis, snowboard?
-Snowboard.
- First-timer?
-Yes.
This way, please.
- Hey. Hey.
-Oh. Thank you.
Hello. I want to rent one of these.
Hello? Natasha.
Is the money deposited?
No, it's a wire transfer.
The check didn't clear.
It takes three days to process.
Okay. I'll call you again.
Department of Security. Come with us.
GIRL 1: Hey, mister. Buy a hat, please.
GIRL 2: Buy a hat.
MAN: Here. I'll take it.
GIRL 2: Wanna buy a hat?
Please buy our hats.
- How much? How much?
-Forty.
Keep the change.
GIRL 2: Thank you.
GIRL 1: Thank you.
Where can I get some clothes?
Thank you.
- Hello.
MARK: Hello. Jackie, where are you?
Suspect just went through the security area.
He's in some security area.
Tell him to keep going.
Hey, keep moving. Go ahead.
No. There's a picture.
If I go through, I'll get shot.
- But the sign says he'll be shot.
-it's just for kids.
It's just for kids. Go ahead.
Huh? Hell--
Get the men together.
Prepare to move out.
Welcome, my friend.
- We've been waiting for you.
-That's good.
Uh, hello.
- Where the hell are you?
-About two miles...
...upside...
...west of a restricted-area sign.
- Two miles west of the restricted-area sign.
-it's over there.
Hurry up. I'm freezing.
Put on more clothes.
Huh? Okay. Clothes.
My boss is waiting.
- There's someone out in Area B.
-Who is it?
Maybe Chinese.
- Who did you bring with you?
-Nobody.
They're inside.
- See anyone else?
-I didn't see anybody around.
Stay back, we will handle the arrest.
Let's go. Move in!
It's bloody freezing here.
Nice hat. Aren't you cold?
What do you think?
All units stand by. The enemy has arrived.
Give me the briefcase.
Don't move.
Back off.
Tell your people not to open fire.
I have a detonator wired to the uranium core.
Freeze! Don't move.
Hey, it's a trap!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Grab the case. Grab the case. Get it.
MARK:
Jackie, go. Get the snowmobile!
Unh!
Mark.
Tsui, what are you doing here?
Get the chopper off the ground.
Jackie, over here!
Shoot him. Shoot him.
YEGOROV:
Let's go.
Go. Move.
- Mark.
-Go on. Go.
Mark.
Go!
Don't move.
Little more. Give me your hand. Come on!
Help.
There. Over there. Get the case.
MAN:
Hello, Jackie.
Who are you?
I'm Colonel Gregor Yegorov
of the Russian Federal Security Bureau.
- Huh?
YEGOROV: Well, FSB for short.
The new, improved KGB.
KGB?
- Am I in Russia?
YEGOROV: Yes.
We're connected
to the Ukraine Department of Security.
I know about your operation with the CIA.
The FSB generals want to see you.
You are coming to Moscow with me today.
- Can you help me?
-Yes.
Take off all those things.
- I'm very hot.
YEGOROV: Heh.
MAN:
Jackie, welcome.
...who smuggled out a nuclear warhead
a few days ago.
His name is Tsui.
He was recruited by the CIA
to steal uranium production strategies...
...from the Russian government.
He has been under investigation for years.
We believe he has a sister living in Australia.
Her name is Annie.
We want you to find her.
This mission is very important
to our nation and national security.
I think I have to call my superior
in Hong Kong.
- Ah.
MAN: We already did.
They have agreed to attach you
to our mission.
Okay.
JACKIE:
We're not flying to Australia in this, are we?
YEGOROV:
Part of the way.
Where are we going now?
YEGOROV:
We're going down.
- To the submarine?
YEGOROV: Yes.
MAN: Colonel.
-We are heading to Australia now.
There will be a fisherman's boat
taking us in.
Everything is already arranged for you.
- Are we being smuggled in?
-Heh. No, I wouldn't use that term.
The boat will pick us up.
JACKIE:
Uncle Bill, I'm in Australia having a great time.
I'm talking to you
while enjoying my great view.
Wow, working for the FSB is great.
I have a presidential suite with two levels.
Eight thousand square feet
with swimming pool, sauna and Jacuzzi.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.
My koala bear just came out.
What? You mean, in your hotel room?
It's only a stuffed toy, right?
No.
It's the real thing. Say hello to Uncle Bill.
He's too shy. Don't hang up. Hold on.
You have to wait. I have to carry it back.
Good boy. Good boy, let's go.
- Yes?
-Excuse me, sir, your tea's ready.
Thank you very much.
He's living it up.
I should've gone with him.
JACKIE:
There you go.
That's okay now.
Really, I'm not making this up.
What else?
A great car, money and lots of clothing.
And designer labels, all given to me.
I feel almost like James Bond,
except no gorgeous girls.
Hey, if all of this is for real,
you should be really careful.
Okay, okay. So long. Bye-bye.
Do you think he went crazy
on this assignment? Maybe he's overworked.
Wow, look at these briefs.
Boy, you must be popular.
Own line of underwear.
Who'd wear those?
WOMAN: Hi. One adult?
-Yes.
WOMAN:
Fifteen fifty, please.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Annie Tsui.
WOMAN:
Annie? Uh, she's in a show right now.
Your brother and I are sworn brothers.
He came back?
He did? Oh, actually, I don't know.
He told me you were working here.
I'm on vacation and come to see you.
Sorry I have to leave so soon.
- My dad's hospitalized.
WAITER: Here's your drink.
- Oh, thanks.
-No problem.
- Your job must be dangerous.
-No, not really.
Sharks will only go crazy
when they smell the scent of blood.
When they see anything that moves,
that's when they bite.
As long as you don't move,
nothing will happen.
Oh, now I know.
If I ever see a shark,
I'll pretend to be a rock and not move.
Heh. I have to get to the hospital
to see Dad.
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.
Thanks for the flowers.
- Kerrie Anne? Put that on my tab.
KERRIE ANNE: Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.
-Bye-bye.
- Annie.
-Yeah?
I have never met Mr. Tsui.
Can I go to hospital with you?
Um, all right. Why don't you wait for me
at the front gate? I'll be right there.
Okay.
Hi, Gregor. I met his sister.
I'm going to hospital with her.
Very good. I'll meet you there.
- Hey.
JACKIE: Hi.
WOMAN: Oh, Annie.
-Huh?
- Excuse me, please.
-There's a box for you here.
ANNIE: Uh... I'm going to the hospital.
I'll pick it up later.
'BYE-bye.
'Bye-bye.
ANNIE: Hey, Allen.
-Hi.
- Hi.
-Hi, Daddy.
Are you better today?
Dad, I want you to meet
Tsui's sworn brother.
Never heard him mention you. I'm Allen.
- And your name is?
-I'm Jackie.
- Bugs receiving?
-All operating.
Are you feeling better?
What did the doctor say?
I'm fine, good girl.
Why has my eldest son
never spoken of you?
Actually, I'm not his sworn brother.
I'm with Hong Kong Police.
I'm investigating your older son
stealing a nuclear weapon.
Can I talk to you privately?
What did he say?
He said he's a policeman.
UNCLE SEVEN:
Tell me why you're looking for my son.
Do you know what he does for a living?
I haven't seen him in a long time.
Even when I'm dying,
he does not come to see me.
The Tsui family no longer has a son.
Thank you.
I hope you get better soon.
I didn't mean to lie to you.
Shh.
ANNIE:
I hope that hurt.
You lied to me.
Why couldn't you lie to my dad?
- Listen to me.
-My father loves his eldest son most.
- Just let him die peacefully.
-No--
Get away from me. I don't wanna see you.
If I had any news, I'd never let you know.
- Now, get out of here.
-Okay. Please leave now.
NURSE:
Please be quiet or leave the hospital.
Go.
Please.
TSUI: Annie.
ANNIE: Brother.
Ah.
Where have you been?
Why are you dressed like that?
Just look at yourself in that outfit.
- Do you know dad's having surgery today?
-Yes, I know.
I already spoke to him.
Jackie.
Come in.
That man out there
works for the new Russian Mafia.
He's not a policeman.
You must never believe this man.
Uncle Seven,
he's going to surgery this afternoon.
- What about Tsui?
-He said he hasn't seen him for a long time.
I sent you something yesterday
by messenger.
Did you get it?
Mm-hm. Yeah, I got it this morning.
Good. Annie, you have to hide it
in the safest possible place you can find.
Understand?
What if Uncle Seven dies
and the good son doesn't show?
- If he dies, he'll show up for sure.
-Why are you so sure?
He's the eldest son in the family.
He has to...
Huh?
Carry a flat pint of water.
What is all this?
That's a Chinese tradition.
Someone may be following you already.
Always be careful.
I'm sorry.
You take this.
You might need it
when you follow the girl.
JACKIE:
Wow. Now I'm 007.
- Hi.
-Hi, Annie.
- Uh, can I pick up my package?
-Sure.
WOMAN : underwater
is now closing. Please make your way
- There you go.
-Thanks.
- Bye, Annie.
-Bye.
WOMAN
Thank you. Thank you.
WOMAN:
Annie?
- I thought you'd gone already.
-Oh. Uh, not yet.
- Okay, bye-bye.
-All right, bye-bye.
You scared me.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Good jump-
I will follow you
Keep singing.
isn't an ocean too deep
You, out.
I think he's following the girl.
Ever since you touched my hand
I knew
And where you go
I follow, I follow, I follow
You'll always be my true love
My true love
From now until forever
Forever, forever
I will follow you
What's going on?
We've lost the feed.
Track down Jackie's car.
Give me the location.
Come back, come back.
Come on. Come on.
Where are you going?
- It's all right. He won't bite you.
-Take him away.
What are you doing? Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
- He's at the underwater World.
-Obviously, something is going wrong there.
- Now we can talk.
-Yes.
I know you're with the Hong Kong Police.
Who are you working with right now?
Used to be CIA. And now it's the FSB.
- You have a complicated background.
-It was quite simple.
The man you're working for
is Gregor Yegorov.
Do you know him too?
Call him now. Here.
YEGOROV: Yes.
-Hello. Yes. This is Jackie speaking.
YEGOROV:
What the hell is going on?
It's me.
YEGOROV: Who is
-It's Tsui.
YEGOROV:
Tsui.
- So you wanna get rid of me without paying.
YEGOROV: No.
- Fine. I want double now.
YEGOROV: Come on.
In cash. You got three days.
YEGOROV: Tsui.
-I have your phone now.
I'll call you and let you know
where and when to meet.
YEGOROV:
We need to talk about  Tsui--
I'm sorry I had to do that to you.
But look at what's in your second button.
You'll find them in your car
and everything they gave you...
...including this pair
of very ugly underwear.
You're under their surveillance
at every moment.
The less you know, the safer you are.
By the way, Jackie...
...you're a lousy singer.
Everything is here,
but the jacket is missing.
Here is the wallet.
- Are you okay?
JACKIE: Yes.
- Where is Tsui?
-He's gone.
What did he tell you?
What do you think he told me?
Seems like you two
have some kind of deal going on.
Don't believe what he said.
He's an expert in playing mind games.
He's a top CIA agent.
Maybe you're right.
But how do you explain this?
We have to look out for you.
It's part of our job.
You wanted me to find Tsui?
Now he found you.
I will write a full report to my superior
and your superior. I'm out.
That's your clothes. That's your car.
This is my wallet.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm going. Bye-bye.
Unh! Ooh!
- Now kill him.
MAN: Not yet. Let's have some fun first.
Had enough?
Aah!
Huh?
What are you doing taking so long?
This guy can move like a monkey.
Don't push me...
...or I jump-
Okay. Go ahead.
Come. Come to get me.
Go get him.
You go and get him.
Who is it?
Honey, is that you?
Hello?
- Who are you?
-Me?
I'm the window cleaner.
WOMAN:
Window cleaner? Right. You gotta be joking.
- Who are you?
-Huh?
Uh, I'm the dry cleaner.
Dry cleaner?
Anna?
WOMAN
JACKIE:
Now they want to silence me forever.
Hey, hold on a second.
So who wants to silence you forever?
JACKIE: Uh, Gregor.
-Gregor? But you are working for him.
Did you call the police?
But I don't have a passport.
I come over illegally.
I'll call the Australian police. You go and report
this tomorrow, and they will help you.
Just find some hotel
to spend the night tonight.
A hotel? I don't even have the money
to pay for this call. I have to hang up now.
What are your plans for tonight?
JACKIE:
sleep on the street.
We're two hours ahead. Uh--
MAN:
Hey.
- Yes?
MAN: Get out of my bed.
JACKIE:
Sorry.
Anyone here?
No, he's on vacation.
-Hey.
-Yes?
- Give me a hand.
-Yes.
Hit the wall.
Harder.
Good night.
Good night.
MAN: I'm sorry, Miss Tsui,
but your father's murderer is still at large.
Your family may be in danger.
Go back with your brother
and get some rest.
We'll send a uniform unit to take you home
and protect you 24 hours.
- Thank you, sir.
-Bye, miss.
Come, Annie. Let's go home.
We got a tough one on our hands, Lewis.
Get this videotape analyzed.
See if the suspect really is
the guy on the tape.
Contact Hong Kong Police,
get a positive ID on this guy.
The man who controlled it all,
head of the Golden Dragon Association...
sir?
-...Uncle Seven, was murdered...
- Can I have some juice, please?
-Sure.
...at St. Paul Memorial Hospital
late last night.
Although unnoticed by staff,
the killer was spotted...
-...the daughter of Uncle Seven...
-Here's your money.
...believes the suspect
to be a Hong Kong policeman...
...known to her only as Jackie,
who visited Uncle Seven.
The killer is on the loose,
subject of a citywide manhunt.
Thank you.
NEWSCASTER".
Authorities fear the murder of Uncle Seven...
-...will mean chaos in Chinatown.
-Hey. That was the murder suspect. Look.
NEWSCASTER:
And now
Allen.
I didn't kill your father.
- Call the cops!
-Please, wait.
If I really killed him,
would I come to see you?
- Get him.
-Hear me out. Please listen to me.
Let me say one thing.
- You want me to call the police?
-Wait.
Wait.
Hear me out.
Can you please tell me
where your brother's hiding?
Why do you want him?
Only your brother can prove I'm not a killer.
It's you.
Let's beat him up first.
Stop!
Please. Please listen to me.
TSUI: Allen.
ALLEN: Brother?
He didn't kill our father.
Come with me.
ALLEN:
Let's go downstairs.
Let's go.
I think we know who the murderer is.
Gregor wants to force you out.
What is the history between you two?
Three years ago, I was in the Ukraine
collecting nuclear intelligence for the CIA.
The KGB caught me
with my girlfriend Natasha.
NATASHA:
Aah!
Natasha!
To save Natasha, I had to agree.
Gregor was with the KGB?
Yes, and he's now the head
of the new Russian Mafia...
...and makes use of his connections
as an FSB officer.
So he wants to buy a nuclear warhead?
Yes, but not for himself.
He uses the nuclear weapons...
...to secure oil franchises
in Middle Eastern countries.
You should give the warhead
to the police right away.
I can't do that. Not until I get my money.
How many people
have you killed for money?
Your father died
because you wanted the money.
Do you know how many nuclear weapons
have been sold...
...by military superpowers?
I know that is the truth.
We cannot change it.
You cannot use that as an excuse.
I'm not as idealistic as you.
I'm not idealistic,
but if we cannot stop them...
...we should not encourage them.
- Annie?
-Just for money, you murdered father.
I will never forgive you for that.
I'll expose Gregor for what he is...
...and give you evidence of his crimes...
...but I'll need you to help me.
Yes, I know.
When I first started at the CIA...
...I had so much ambition.
But since then, I've done a lot of things
I'm not very proud of.
They wouldn't let me contact my family.
I lost my identity.
If I hadn't agreed
to do those things for Gregor...
...I would have died three years ago.
Brother.
Let us remember that in God's good graces,
we will all find shelter.
For his is a mercy without end.
We're at the funeral of Uncle Seven,
the head of the Golden Dragon Association...
...who was brutally murdered last week.
There's a strong police presence
here today...
...to escort the spirit of Uncle Seven
to the heart of Chinatown.
VKR, this is Bravo 840.
We're leaving Holy Trinity with Annie Tsui.
Help! Help! Aah!
No! Aah!
Careful. Lots of police here.
I'm here at Wickham Square.
Where are you?
ANNIE:
No! Let go!
You even share the same coffin
with your father.
The coffin is for you.
You killed my father.
He had to die somehow,
at least he died for a reason.
If you move one more step,
they'll blow your head off.
Open.
- Damn. I can't see a thing.
-I need backup. Hurry.
- Now what?
-Killing me won't bring him back.
Give me the bomb,
I'll give you the money. I promise.
And then you'll never see me again.
You think your money can pay
for my father's life?
No, I guess not, but I've got your sister.
Look.
She's young, sexy and beautiful.
You don't want her to die.
You bastard.
Move again, I'll break your arm.
Hurry, give me your hand.
If you don't give me the bomb,
I'll kill both of you right now.
I know you got it here.
No. You have to let her go first.
- Brother!
-Annie.
Annie, get out of here. Hurry up.
Give my stuff to the police.
Uh-huh.
Put him in the coffin.
Come on, move!
- Go. Quick.
-Okay.
- Can I help you?
-Yes.
Thank you.
Yes! Get out!
Aah!
Hey,hey!
Oh!
Give me your hand.
- Help me. Help me, Jackie.
-You just don't move!
- Get me off this thing. Oh, my God!
-Hang in there. I'm on my way, okay?
Aah! Help!
Excuse me.
Help me! Help!
Please stop this thing!
Aah! Aah!
- Please help me.
MAN: Here you go, miss.
- You okay?
-Yes.
How'd you get on top of the elevator?
- Okay, thank you very much.
-Hey, hey, hey. Hang on a minute.
We're gonna write a report
and call the police, okay?
Central security, we're on the top floor.
The girl's all okay.
Would you please call the police?
Mick and me are coming down
to fill out a report.
You look very familiar.
I think I've seen you before.
Oh.
Don't move.
He hasn't got a gun.
JACKIE: Unh!
ANNIE: Oh!
Oh! Uh...
- Oh, lady.
-I'm sorry.
- Just go, go, go-
-Okay, okay-
Follow me.
REPORTER: We're live at Wickham Square
where the funeral of Uncle Seven...
...has turned into the biggest gang war
in Chinatown.
A group of terrorists, allegedly members
of the new Russian Mafia...
...gunned down the ceremony
with a rocket-propelled grenade.
Police say the murder suspect, Jackie...
...was last seen escaping through this mall
with Uncle Seven's daughter.
Investigations continue as more bloodshed
is expected in Chinatown.
Inspector,
results of the tape have come back.
That's not Jackie. Looks like a setup.
Right.
Come on.
In here.
- Annie, I must make a long-distance call.
ANNIE: What?
- Call upstairs in the office.
-Thank you.
YEGOROV:
Where is everybody?
- They're on their way.
-They're in the office. Get them.
Okay.
Hey.
- Wait for my orders on every move.
-Yes, sir.
Uncle Bill, it's Jackie.
UNCLE BILL: What's happening?
-I'm with younger sister. We were caught.
Please tell me what to do.
Just listen to me. I briefed the head
of the FSB on your situation.
Look, don't worry about it.
It's all very clear to him.
He knows you're a Hong Kong cop.
- Huh?
-Mm.
Wha--?
- You two, get our boat ready.
-Yes, sir.
Six tickets, please.
- What happened?
WOMAN 1: Quick, he needs an ambulance.
WOMAN 2:
Sorry, you can't come in here.
What's going on?
Take him. Get him up.
Where did they go?
Fix him.
Lock them up. You two, come with me.
Aah!
JACKIE: Huh?
-Get him.
Go down. Get him.
Faster, faster!
GO, go, go'
- Shark!
-Sharks don't bite.
Go back in.
MAN 1: Shark.
MAN 2: There's a shark.
It's just a small shark.
Get the weapon. Go down!
Aah!
- Did you see it?
-Yes, I think so.
- Jackie still has it.
-Go down and get it.
- No, two already died.
-That's an order.
- No, I won't.
-That's an order.
- I can see them from the restaurant.
-Let's go.
- Excuse me, is that a new show?
-Yeah, what's going on?
I don't know.
Hey, hey, look at this.
- This is great.
-What's going on?
Get back. Get back!
Back!
Nobody move!
Stay where you are.
YEGOROV:
Follow me.
- Give me the gun.
-Yes, sir.
Get her!
Move. Get back!
No! No!
Jackie!
Aah! No! Aah!
No. No!
Let's go.
WOMAN:
There's a shark!
Go, go, go. Move!
No! Aah! No! Let go!
MAN:
The boat is ready. Quickly, let's go.
ANNIE:
Please.
Aah! No! Jackie!
Jackie!
MAN:
Shut up. Get in. Get in.
Goodbye.
- Tie her up.
-Hey!
- Run!
ANNIE: Aah! Aah!
You have put your country to shame.
MAN 1:
Go. Get moving.
MAN 2:
Move it.
Your turn.
When you get back, write a report
which is detailed and simple...
...starting from the beginning.
-Huh?
