Transformers!
More than meets the eye!
Transformers!
part 1
Many millions of years ago
on the planet Cybertron
live existed.
But not life
as we know it today.
Intelligent robots
that could think and feel
inhabited the cities.
They were called
Autobots and Decepticons.
But the brutal Decepticons
were driven by a single goal:
Total domination!
They set out
to destroy
the peace-loving Autobots.
and the war between
the forces of good and evil
raged across Cybertron.
Devastating all in it's path
draining the planet's
once rich sources of energy.
The Autobots on the
verge of extinction
battled valiantly to survive.
There is not enough energy
in these conductors to last a quartex.
At least found these,
Wheeljack!
And when these run out?
Can't worry about that now.
Let's get back to Iacon.
-Load up!
-I bet Optimus Prime
will be glad to see us.
We are nearing the bridge to Iacon.
One megamile to go.
Home, sweet home!
Oh, oh.
A Decepticon
welcoming committee.
Autobots!
Stop them!
Prime told me
there'll be days like this.
And you didn't believe him?
I do now.
We got to get these
energy conductors
back to Iacon.
I'm right behind you.
Try to find a cut in.
After them!
Bumblebee, get in, quick!
You are all right?
Yeah,
I think it's
my rear axel.
Well hang on to your crankshaft
I'm shifting into overdrive.
They've gone underground,
we will never catch them now.
We better report back
to Megatron.
Wheeljack to Iacon:
we are coming in.
Laserbeak,
prepare for flight!
Destination: Iacon.
Operation: assimilation.
Laserbeak: Autobot alert.
Disclosure averted,
continue observation.
Any luck, Jazz?
Negative.
All side of Cybertron's is blacker than
the inside of a drive shaft.
Unless a new supply of energy is found,
nobody is going to win this war.
When do we start
the search mission?
Soon as you are
ready to launch.
If there is a new source
of energy to be found
the Decepticons must find it first.
Autobots are set to launch,
Megatron.
As are we.
Shockwave!
What is your command,
Megatron?
You are to stay behind.
I ain't trust Cybertron to you,
Shockwave?
Fear not, Megatron,
Cybertron shall remain,
as you leave it.
Excellent.
Now it's nearly a matter of time
until Optimus Prime it meets defeat.
The Autobots would have
lost aeons ago if
I've been calling the shocks.
Starscream,
only a select few ever lead.
My time will come,
Megatron.
Never, never!
Prepare to blast off!
All systems: go.
Ignition.
Contact.
Blast off!
-Look!   -What is it?  -An asteroid.
-There is another one!
-They are going to collide.
Leaking lubricant.
Hang on everybody.
Meteor shower. Meteor shower.
We are losing our power.
Jazz!
Ironhide, man the laser gun!
-Got it.
-Fire!
Follow them!
Follow them!
New tracks report:
we are being followed.
Decepticons.
We have been detected.
Stay with them!
Let's just blow them away,
they have seen us.
No, I want to know
what they are after.
Prepare the tractor beam!
They have made a magnetic junction,
I can't shake them.
-Fire the laser!
-Nothing!
Power is used up.
Release the boarding shoot.
They are coming aboard.
Prepare for battle!
Attack!
Attack!
What's happening?
G-forces,
they are dragging us down.
We are out of control.
Explore, explore.
Repair, repair.
Megatron, my leader,
we are alive again.
Quickly,
we must revive
the other Decepticons.
Much time has passed.
We are on a planet
far from Cybertron,
but our mission
has not changed.
How we know
Cybertron still exists?
It must exists.
And if this land is filled with resources,
we shall return home
with the power
to build the ultimate weapon
and conquer the universe.
-Starscream!
-I'm just saying good bye.
Save your energy!
The autobots have taken
their last flight.
Thanks for the ride, Prime,
Too bad you can't go
the rest of the way.
Explore, explore.
Repair, repair.
Thanks.
We will set up here.
Those rocks will serve as
our base of operations.
Soundwave,
prepare plans
for a new space cruiser!
Starscream,
convert the area for construction.
What about materials?
Use your imagination!
Well, any ideas?
There!
Great, I'll need some help.
Rumble activate pile drivers.
Operation: destruction.
Let's do it!
This new planet is rich
with sources of energy.
But the Decepticons
must know this too.
So we must find them
and stop them.
-Hound! -Right here, Prime.
-Scout the area, see if
you can locate the Decepticons.
Just turn me loose, Prime.
I'll sniff them out.
I'm going too.
I wanna boost some Decepticon
right in his turbo charger.
Easy, Cliffjumer,
just find them.
We will deal with them later.
Good luck!
Some day
I will be giving the orders,
Rumble.
You'll do what I say.
Look Starscream, Megatron is strong,
he is merciless, he can't be beaten.
And you will never be our leader.
I'll find a way.
Everyone has a weakness.
Yeah? Well, not Megatron.
We shall see.
Now, shake things up a little.
I'm impressed.
There is a lot different
then Cybertron out here.
Don't fall in love with it, Hound.
We won't be staying that long.
You smell something,
Cliffjumper?
-No.
-I do. I think we just
found the Decepticons.
Follow me!
I was right.
Let's get down there
and bend some metal!
Ease off your throttle,
Cliffjumper!
Remember what Prime said:
"just find them"!
What are they doing?
Let's find out!
I will plunder Earth and
steal its precious resources.
We can concentrate the energy
into energon cubes
and store them
in the new space cruiser.
How ironic.
By leading us to this planet
the Autobots have sealed
their own doom.
Cliffjumper,
what are you doing?
I've got Megatron
dead center
in my view finder.
Who could be firing on us?
Who even knows we are here?
-The Autobots.
-Impossible.
-They're the only ones.
Soundwave,
send Laserbeak to investigate.
Laserbeak prepare for flight!
Close heading, north-east.
-Now, you've done it!
-Let's burn rubber!
What is that thing up there?
I don't know,
but we can't seem to shake it.
Let's split up!
It can't follow both of us.
Right, at least one of us
will get back to Prime.
Accelerator down.
Eat my dust, birdbrain!
You couldn't hit
an Autobot with a moonbeam.
Try this, it's a gas.
You don't give up, do you?
Nooooo!!!
Where did they get you?
I... I think it's my...
my drive train.
-Can you transform?
-I... I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Hound, it's my fault,
I shouldn't have fired on Megatron.
You shouldn't have missed,
you mean.
Ha, yeah, right!
Halliard hale him up!
I can't believe
the Autobots survived.
Either can Megatron.
I thought he blow a fuse
when he found out.
Hey, what's that?
Let's find out!
Ok, Reflector,
let's see what you can see!
-Alien vehicle approaching,
possible Autobot.
Release Ravage!
I don't understand it, Joe.
Looks like a tornado hit this place.
Ai, I don't like it.
Something is wrong,
real wrong.
Look out!
And that's all we heard, Prime.
They are gonna put the energy
in some kind of cube then
pull it back to Cybertron.
Jazz, organize a battle unit,
we are going after them.
Prowl!
Trailbreaker!
Wheeljack!
Ironhide, Mirage, Sunstreaker!
Sideswipe!
Autobots, start roll engines!
Ready, Prime.
Let's roll!
Megatron, Laserbeak has returned.
He has found a source of energy.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Give me a hand, Spike,
we got to raise this bit
Watch it out!
Right dad, I will get the bailer.
Dive, dive!
Look, up there!
-What is it?
-What are they?
Everybody, come on!
Come on!
Look out!
Stop!
Let go my dad!
Spike!
Starscream,
activate an oil ray,
now!
Soundwave,
prepare the energon cubes.
We did it, we did it,
Megatron, the energy is ours.
We can go back to Cybertron.
You fool, Starscream,
this is but a small fraction
of the energy we need.
We must suck this planet Earth dry.
It's the Autobots.
Decepticons, transform!
Transform!
Don't interfere, Prime!
Give it up, Megatron!
The universe is mine.
So long, Prime,
have a nice swim.
Here is something to keep you warm.
Help, help!
We can't get out.
Somebody, save us!
The fire, it's coming closer.
I can't lift it,
too heavy.
Grab on to me,
keep your heads above water.
The TRANS-FORMERS will return
after these messages
In the next episode

the evil Decepticons

Optimus Prime battles
his arch enemy Megatron
