You take this!
You can have this ticket
and keep it!
I am not paying
that ticket!
Jesus!
Would you watch
where you're going?
Then I want you
to go downstairs
to the cellar,
and check the water line
to the boiler.
Check the bump, all right?
I want to do that today,
all right?
Could you do that?
Frank, would you mind giving
me a hand with these?
Hey, I ain't the doorman,
Miss Barrett,
I'm the building
superintendent.
You're also
a human being, Frank.
Okay, it's not my job,
but what the hell,
I'll do you a favor.
Listen, when are you
going to get around
to fixing the radiator
in the baby's room?
I asked you last week.
Didn't I do that?
It's getting really cold
in there, I--I--I--I...
Okay, well,
it's no problem.
Hey!
Hey! Stop that carriage!
Whoa! Get it!
Stop!
That's my baby!
Watch out!
Jesus!
Watch out!
My God!
Stop that carriage!
RAY: How many of them
are there?
Fourteen. They're in here.
I hope you can
handle it.
It's been like
a nightmare.
How big are they?
Hmm?
Four feet.
Hey, hey!
Listen up, listen up!
Look who's here!
Hey!
How you doin', kids?
Aw, I thought it was
gonna be He-Man.
Hey, hey, I know.
Why don't we all sit down
and we'll have fun!
Yeah!
You know,
my dad says you guys
are full of crap.
Jason, hush!
Well, some people have trouble
believing in the paranormal.
No, he says you guys
are full of crap
and that's why you went
out of business.
Song.
Come on,
everybody!
When there's
something strange
In the neighborhood
Who you gonna call
CHILDREN: He-Man!
He-Man! He-Man!
And it don't look good
Let's go get a beer,
all right?
Yeah.
Bye.
Thank you.
Call any time.
That's it.
I've had it, Ray.
No more parties.
Here's your share.
Look, I'm tired of taking
abuse from over privileged
nine-year-olds.
I know, Z,
but we can't quit now.
The holidays are coming up.
It's our best season.
Ray, man, face it.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist.
A year from now
those kids won't even
remember who we are.
Ungrateful little
yuppie larvae.
After all we did
for this city.
Yeah.
We conjured up
a hundred foot
marshmallow man,
blew the top three floors
off an uptown high rise,
ended up getting sued by
every state, county and
city agency in New York.
Yeah.
But what a ride.
DANA: Went right out
into the middle of traffic.
And I started
really running after it.
And then it just
suddenly stopped,
right in the middle
of the street.
Mmm-hmm, and did anyone else
see this happen?
Well, sure.
Hundreds of people.
Egon, I didn't
imagine this.
I'm not saying you did,
it's just in science,
we always look
for the simplest explanation.
WOMAN: We're ready,
Dr. Spengler.
Good, we'll start
with the negative calibration.
What are you
working on, Egon?
I'm trying to determine
whether human emotions
actually affect
the physical environment.
It's a theory Ray
and I had when we were
still Ghostbusters.
Can they see us?
EGON: No.
They think they're here
for marriage counseling.
We kept them waiting
for two and a half hours,
and I've been gradually
increasing the temperature
in the room.
It's up to 95 degrees
at the moment.
Now my assistant
is asking them if they'd mind
waiting another half hour.
Oh, good. Very good.
Very, very nice.
So, Egon,
what do you think?
Excellent,
just excellent.
Do the happiness index next.
I mean about the carriage.
Well, I'd like to bring
Ray in on this,
if you don't mind.
Sure, whatever you think.
But not Venkman.
Oh, no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally.
How is he these days?
Peter? Well, he was
borderline for a while.
Then he crossed
the border.
Does he ever
mention me?
No.
Oh.
Well, we didn't part
on very good terms,
and then we sort of
lost track of each other
after I got married.
We're ready for
the affection test.
Good.
Send in the puppy, please.
I thought of getting
in touch with him after
my marriage ended, but...
Oh.
Isn't that sweet?
I appreciate
you're doing this.
Try not to worry.
Here's my phone number.
You'll call me?
Yes.
I'd rather
you didn't mention
any of this to Peter,
if you don't mind.
No, I won't.
Thanks.
Let's see what happens
when we take away the puppy.
Hi. Welcome back
to
I'm Peter Venkman.
I'm chatting
with my guest,
author, lecturer
and psychic,
Milton Angland.
Milt, your new book is called
Now, can you tell us
when it's gonna be,
or do we have
to buy the book?
Well, I predict
that the world will end
at the stroke of midnight
on New Year's Eve.
This year?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, that's cutting it
a little bit close, isn't it?
I mean, just from a sales
point of view,
your book is
just coming out,
you're not gonna see
any paperback sales
for at least a year.
It'll be at least
another year
before you know
whether you've got
that mini-series
or movie of the week
kind of possibilities.
I mean, just
devil's advocate, Milty,
shouldn't you have said,
"Hey, the world's
gonna end in 1992!"
Wait. Wait a minute.
Or better yet, 1994?
This is not just
some moneymaking scheme,
all right?
I have a strong
psychic belief
that the world will end
on New Year's Eve.
Well, for your sake,
I hope you're right.
Okay, but I think
my other guest
may disagree with you.
Elaine?
Now, you had
another date in mind.
According to my source,
the end of the world
will be on February 14th
in the year 2016.
Valentine's Day.
Bummer.
Where'd you get your date,
Elaine?
I received this information
from an alien.
As I told my husband,
it was in
the Paramus Holiday Inn.
I was having a drink
at the bar, alone,
and this alien
approached me.
He started talking to me.
He bought me a drink,
and then I think
he must have used
some kind of a ray
or a mind-control device,
because he forced me
to follow him to his room,
and that's where
he told me about
the end of the world.
So, your alien had a room
at the Holiday Inn, Paramus.
It might have been
a room on the spacecraft
made up to look like
a room at the Holiday Inn.
I can't be sure
about that, Peter.
Of course not,
and that is
the whole problem
with aliens,
is you just can't
trust 'em.
Occasionally,
you meet a nice one.
Starman, ET.
But usually
they turn out to be
some kind of big lizard.
That's all the time
we've got for this week
on
Next week, though...
Give me, Ira.
Hairless pets.
Weird.
Until then, this is
Peter Venkman saying
see you then. Bye.
Norman, where do you
find these people?
Weren't we supposed to have
the telekinetic guy
who bends the spoons?
He cancelled.
This is the best we could do
with such short notice.
Look, no respected psychic
will come on the show.
They think
you're a fraud.
I am a fraud.
Mr. Mayor?
Lenny! Lenny!
Pete Venkman.
Can I help you?
Yeah, get
your hand off me.
Thank you, I'm an old friend
of the mayor's,
I wanted to say hello,
give him a kiss.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer,
I'm the mayor's assistant.
I know who you are,
Dr. Venkman, I just
don't see
any ghosts anywhere.
Well, that's why I wanted
to talk to his highness.
See, we did a little job
for the city a while back,
and we got stiffed
on the bill
by some bureaucratic bookworm
like yourself.
Look, you stay away
from the mayor.
He's running
for governor next fall,
and the last thing we need is
for him to be associated
with two-bit frauds
and publicity hounds
like you and your friends.
You know, I'm a voter.
Aren't you supposed to lie
to me and kiss my butt?
JANOSZ: All right, yes.
Now I want you
to put the Vigo
in the arch,
under the arch there.
Everything you're doing
is bad.
I want you
to know this.
You be careful there,
all right?
No one listens to me.
Well, Dana,
how are you doing?
How's this Bonington coming?
It's coming along fine.
This mixture you gave me
is working really well.
Yes, well I make
pretty good cocktails,
don't I?
Yes, you're
doing really quite
good work there.
DANA: Thank you.
I think
it won't be long
before you can
assist me in
more important
restoration.
Just taking
a white thing.
Well, thank you,
Dr. Poha...
Janosz.
Janosz. Um,
I've enjoyed working here,
but now that my baby's
a little older,
I'm gonna try to go back
to the orchestra.
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, that you
will not be not here.
Well, could I
say goodbye,
maybe bring you
to a brunch today?
Well, I can't today,
I have an appointment.
In fact, I better go.
I don't
understand this.
Every day, I say,
"Well, can you
do something?"
You say,
"No, I can't
do something."
Do I have a bad breath
or something?
Of course not.
All right.
Well, I give you
a rain check.
I think that
she likes me.
No, I do,
I truly do.
EGON: This one's interesting,
Ray. Berlin, 1939,
a flower cart
took off by itself,
rolled half a kilometer,
My best
to the coven.
Berlin, huh?
You know,
you should also check
Duke University,
mean-averaging studies
on controlled psycho-kinesis.
I pulled it.
PETER: Uh, perhaps
you could help me.
I'm looking for
a love potion aerosol
that I could spray
on a certain
pet
to obtain
her total submission.
Hello, Venkman.
Hi, Pete,
how's it going?
Very well. Hi, Egon.
How's school?
Bet those science chicks
really dig that large cranium
of yours, huh?
I think
they're more interested
in my epididymis.
Ray, let's close
this place up so you can
buy me a calzone.
Oh, I can't really
do that right now, Pete,
I'm working on something.
But your book came in.
Thank you.
Good luck
with that, Venkman.
Will you put this
on my account, please?
Sure.
Ray, take a look at this.
Oh, yeah.
What are you guys
working on?
Uh, well, we're
just kind of...
Ahem.
Checking something out
for an old friend.
Neat. Who?
Um...
Ray's Occult.
midnight on Saturdays.
Thank you.
Who?
Who?
Uh, just someone
we know.
Oh.
Who?
I can't!
No, no, no!
Oh, yes you can.
Who?
Nobody, nobody!
Can you tell me now?
I can't,
I can't!
Now?
Dana Barrett!
Ow!
My Dana Barrett?
DANA: I'll get it!
RAY: Hi, Dana.
Hi, Ray.
How good to see you.
Thanks for coming.
Hey, no problem.
Always glad to help and hug.
Hello, Dana.
Hi, Egon.
Nice place.
Um...
Well, I know
I'm asking for the big hurt,
but I thought
I'd give us
one more chance.
He tortured me.
He pulled my ears!
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Dana.
So, what would you
like to do first?
We'd like to examine
the baby first.
Yeah.
And anything
associated with the baby,
especially stuffed toys,
things with fabrics
and stuffing.
We'd like to see the buggy.
All right, can I
put him over here?
Wherever he sleeps.
Yes.
This would be fine.
This okay?
We'll have to
lay him down flat.
DANA: Okay, sweetheart,
they're gonna take
a look at you.
EGON: We'll do a cursory
medical examination.
What do you say?
Gammel and pross
infant acuity test?
Sounds good.
We'll finish with
an apgar score.
It's nothing that's gonna
hurt him, right?
No, no,
I don't think so.
He'll be fine.
Have you ever
done this before?
On a chimp.
So, whatever happened
to Mr. Right, anyway?
I heard he ditched you
and ran off to Europe.
He didn't ditch me.
We had some problems,
and he got
a very good job offer
from an orchestra in London,
and he took it.
So he ditched you.
Okay, subject is
a male Caucasian,
approximately...
24 inches.
Subject weighs
approximately 18 pounds
and is about
eight months old.
Uh, okay.
Ocular?
Pupillary response normal.
Auditory.
Seems normal.
Ampullary reflex?
Uh, appears
to be ticklish.
Yep, baby ticklish.
You know,
you'd have been better off
marrying me?
You never asked me.
And whenever I brought it up,
you'd get drowsy
and fall asleep.
You never got it, Dana.
I'm a man.
I'm sensitive.
I need to feel loved,
I need to be desired.
It was when you
started introducing me
as the old ball and chain.
That's when I left.
Well, I may have
a lot of personal problems,
but I'm a total professional
when it comes to my job.
Egon.
What?
What are we doing?
He seems
to be fine, Dana.
Mmm-hmm. He's very healthy.
He's okay.
When he does sleep,
where do you put him?
Uh, right around here.
I'll show you.
Uh, Venkman, would you get
a stool specimen, please?
Business or personal?
It's a little messy.
Well, we don't want
to play with anything,
we just want
to sweep for valences.
Hmm, very cheerful.
My parents didn't
believe in toys.
You wanna play
with a big kid?
You know, I should
have been your father.
I mean,
I could have been.
I understand.
Help! He's gone
completely berserk!
Help!
Uh-oh.
You mean, you never
even had a slinky?
We had part of a slinky.
But I straightened it.
He, um, he had
some sort of,
uh, clear liquid coming
out of his mouth too.
Yeah, well that happens.
Well, what do you think?
Well, he's ugly.
I mean, he's not
Elephant Man ugly,
but he's not attractive.
Was his father ugly?
Don't listen.
And he stinks.
You're ripe,
Did his father stink?
Yeah.
Daddy was a smelly, huh?
What's your name?
DANA: His name is Oscar.
Named after a hot dog.
You poor man.
You poor, poor man.
Oh, but seriously,
there's nothing
unusual about him,
is there?
Well, I don't have a lot
of experience with babies.
But you're excited now,
because Mama's here to get
your stool sample.
Right, Mama?
Stool sample?
Nothin'.
So, what, braniac?
I'd like to run
some gynecological tests
on the mother.
Who wouldn't?
Let's check the street.
DANA: It stopped
right over there,
in the middle
of the crosswalk.
All right,
I can get us out there.
Hey, Venkman!
Hold on, hold on.
PETER: We're scientists,
excuse us!
Get out of the way!
Thanks a lot.
Hey, we gotta do
an inquiry here, hold on.
Thanks, appreciate it.
Thanks for holding on.
MAN: Hey, you wanna move
out of there or what?
Relax, you're on the meter.
Come on, hey,
we're scientists.
Get out of the way.
I think we hit
the honey pot.
There's something brewing
under the street.
I've got
on the gygometer.
Well, what
does that mean?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Me?
Yeah.
Fine, fine, it's
cutting fine now.
OFFICER: Great.
Why are you cutting?
Why am I cutting?
Yeah.
Boss!
Who told you
to stop cuttin'?
Somebody tell you to stop?
What are you guys doin' here?
You tell him to stop cuttin'?
Yes, I told him to stop
cutting. What are you doing?
What's it look like?
Why don't you let us work,
we let you work!
He's been
workin' overtime.
I'll tell you, we're here
'cause some diaper bag
is makin' us work
on a Friday night.
Am I right, Peter?
Of course you're right,
Raymond. Is he right, Ziggy?
Yo.
You guys take it
easy, all right?
How's it going?
What have you been doing?
What have I been doing
while you're getting coffee
for an hour?
I've been digging a big hole
in the middle of the street.
Wow!
Looks like you've uncovered
an old air shaft.
Man, that just goes
on and on.
This is very intense.
We should get
a deeper reading.
Yeah. We're going to need
a deeper reading.
Yeah, somebody has
to go down there.
Somebody's gotta
go down there.
Listen to me.
What? Who?
I, Vigo,
the scourge of Carpathia,
the sorrow of Moldavia,
command you.
Oh, command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls
in the castle of pain,
I sat on a throne of blood.
What was will be.
What is will be no more.
Now is the season of evil.
Evil?
Find me a child,
that I might live again.
Yes, a child.
A child!
A child?
A child.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Speed's good, boys.
Keep it comin'.
We're breaking through.
See some light.
I'm in some kind
of a chamber.
There's tile work.
Slime!
It's a river of slime!
PETER: What?
There's gotta be
It's flowing
through here like a river!
Van horn...
Pneumatic transit.
I can't believe it!
It's the old pneumatic
transit system.
It's still here!
Okay, whoa, whoa!
That's good, that's good.
Hold me up,
that's good.
What do you see?
All right.
I'll see if I can
get a sample.
MAN:
What's going on here?
Hey, what's the story?
Hey, what, you boneheads
are gonna come and roust
me out again?
I got 3000 phones out
in Greenwich Village!
I got about eight million
miles of cable I gotta check.
You're gonna come and shake
my monkey tree again?
What are you talkin' about,
buddy? The phone lines are
over there!
What did I say to you?
The phone lines
are over there!
What did I say?
How many times?
OFFICER: Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, you're not with
Con Ed or the phone company.
We checked.
So tell me another one.
I got a major
gas leak here!
Where do you think
all this is coming from,
the sky?
Uh, okay, boys.
Boys?
Uh, pull me up now,
all right?
There's some kind
of activity going on
with this stuff...
Hey, help!
Pick me up!
Ray!
Start it, start it!
Boys! Hey, what's
going on up there?
Come on!
Get me
out of this hole!
Hello.
Go back to sleep,
darling.
Who is it?
It's Janosz.
Janosz.
Hello, Janosz.
This is a surprise.
Oh, hello.
Uh, yes, well,
I happened to be here,
in this neighborhood,
and I thought I would stop by
to see how is it with you...
Because of all
this blackness.
Oh.
We're fine,
thank you.
Well, then you're okay.
Well, how is the baby?
He's okay.
Woo-hoo!
He's sleeping.
Oh, but I "wooed."
It's okay.
Do you need anything,
you know?
You want me
to come in?
No, thank you.
All right.
Just thought
that I would check.
You know.
Well, hey, you,
don't let the bed bugs bite.
Good night, Janosz.
STEPHEN: Before we begin
this trial,
I want to make
one thing very clear.
The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts.
I don't believe
in them either.
I don't want to hear a lot
of malarkey about goblins,
spooks and demons.
We're going to stick
to the facts in this case
and leave the ghost stories
to the kiddies, understood?
Wow, sounds like
a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Yeah, they call him
"The Hammer."
What can we do?
It's all in the hands
of our lawyer now.
I think you guys are
making a big mistake.
I do mostly tax law
and some probate stuff
occasionally.
I got my law degree
at night school.
Well, that's fine, Louis.
We got arrested
at night.
Look, just put
these guys away fast,
and make sure they go away
for a long, long time, okay?
I don't think
it's gonna be hard
with this list of charges.
Good.
Very good.
Violating a judicial
restraining order,
willful destruction
of public property,
fraud, malicious mischief.
See you in a couple of years
at your first parole hearing.
You'll never take us alive.
All right, all right.
Let's get on with it.
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen
of the--the audience,
I don't think it's fair
to call my clients frauds.
Okay, so the blackout
was a big problem
for everybody, okay?
I was stuck in an elevator
for two hours,
and I had
to make the whole time.
But I don't blame them,
because one time
I turned into a dog,
and they helped me.
Thank you.
Very good, Louis.
Short, but pointless.
PROSECUTOR: Mr. Fianella.
Please look at
exhibits "A" through "F"
on the table over here.
Do you recognize
this equipment?
FIANELLA: Yeah.
That's the stuff
the cops took
from their truck.
Do you know
what this equipment
is used for?
I don't know.
Catching ghosts, maybe.
I don't know.
May I remind the court
that the defendants are under
a judicial restraining order
that strictly forbids them
from performing services
as paranormal investigators
or eliminators.
STEPHEN: So noted.
Now, Mr. Fianella,
can you identify
the substance in this jar
marked exhibit "F"?
Yeah. yeah, that's
the stuff, all right.
Your Honor, I've been
working underground
for Con Ed for 27 years.
I never saw anything
like this in my life.
Hmm.
Whatever's down there,
they must have put it there.
No, we didn't!
Shut up!
S-S-So you were just trying
to help out a friend?
A friend. Who was frightened.
Who was a scared of what was
happening to her,
and when you're scared,
what?
There was no evil intent.
There was no evil intent,
and no malice.
Because you live here,
and when you live in a place,
and you love it
like you do,
you don't want nothin' bad
to happen... What?
It'll never happen again.
It's an isolated incident.
It's a one-shot deal.
Objection, Your Honor.
What?
He's leading the witness.
Sustained.
Give me a break,
we're both lawyers.
Mr. Tully,
do you have any questions
for this witness
that might have
some bearing on this case?
Do I?
No, we've helped them out
enough already.
No, Your Honor.
Your witness.
Dr. Venkman,
would you tell the court
why it is that you
and your co-defendants
took it upon yourselves
to dig a very big hole
in the middle of First Avenue?
Well, there's so many holes
in First Avenue,
we really didn't think
anyone would notice.
You keep that up, mister,
I'll find you in contempt.
I'm truly sorry,
Your Honor.
PROSECUTOR:
I'll ask you again,
Dr. Venkman.
Why were you
digging the hole?
And please remember
you're under oath.
There are some things
in this world
that go way beyond
human understanding.
Things that cannot
be explained,
things that most people
don't want to know about.
That is where we come in.
So what you're saying
is that the world
of the supernatural
is your
exclusive province?
Kitten, I think
what I'm saying is
that sometimes shit happens,
someone has to deal with it,
and who you gonna call?
Shut up!
Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz,
Egon Spengler, stand up!
Get up!
You too, Mr. Tully.
Find you guilty
on all charges.
Order you to pay fines
in the amount of $25,000 each,
and sentence you to 18 months
in the city correctional
facility at Riker's Island.
Egy, she's twitching.
I'm not finished!
On a more personal note,
let me go on record as saying
that there's no place
for fake charlatans...
Uh, Your Honor?
Shut up!
Tricksters like you
in decent society.
Your Honor,
this is important.
You play on the gullibility
of innocent people.
Yes, sir, but...
Be quiet!
If my hands weren't tied
by the unalterable tethers
of the law,
I would invoke the tradition
of our illustrious forbearers,
reach back to a purer,
sterner justice,
and have you
burned at the stake!
Wow!
Oh, my God,
the Scolari brothers!
The Scolari brothers!
Friends of yours?
I tried them for murder!
Gave them the chair!
You gotta do something!
Why don't you just tell them
you don't believe in ghosts?
You gotta do something!
Help me!
Don't talk to me,
talk to my attorney.
d that's me!
My guys are
still under a judicial
mistrangement order.
That blue thing
I got from her.
They could be
exposing themselves.
And you don't want us
exposing ourselves.
You're next, bubbles.
All right, all right!
I rescind the order.
Case dismissed.
Hooray,
we won the case!
Now do something!
I always hated
this part of the business.
You know,
it's been a couple of years
since we used this stuff.
I hope it still works.
It should.
The power cells have
a half-life of 5,000 years.
Well, there's no time
for a bench test.
Heat 'em up.
Do
Re
Egon
Whoa!
Hold it!
Come on, big boy!
I'm gonna take you home
to my private zoo!
You got him!
You got him!
Spengy, bring the trap!
Okay, okay!
Behind you, Ray!
EGON: Hold him, Ray!
Venkman, start
bringing him back!
Come on, you fish eater.
Let's go. Yeah, tubby.
Ray, keep pulling
to the right!
Okay, the trap's
going in.
Hold it, Ray!
Hit it!
Two in the box.
Ready to go.
We be fast and...
ALL: They be slow.
Wow!
We're the best,
we're the beautiful,
we're the only
Ghostbusters.
We're back!
Ghostbusters.
Yes, we're back.
Certified check,
cash or money order!
Bye-bye.
Now.
Janine, lunch!
Boy, it smells
like somebody
took a big...
RAY: We've been
experimenting with the plasm
we found in the subway tunnel.
Careful.
PETER: Should I get spoons?
EGON: Don't bother.
Watch this.
Go ahead, Ray.
You!
You worthless piece of slime!
You ignorant,
disgusting blob!
You're nothing but an unstable
short-chain molecule!
You foul, obnoxious muck!
You have a weak
electrochemical bond!
I have seen
some disgusting crud
in my time,
but you take the cake!
You--You're just...
Hey, whoa, whoa.
This is what you do
with your spare time.
Peter, this is
an incredible breakthrough.
I mean, what a discovery!
A psycho-reactive substance.
Whatever this stuff is,
it responds to human
emotional states.
Mood slime.
Oh, baby.
You mean this stuff actually
feeds on bad vibes.
Like a cop
in a donut factory.
We've been running tests to
see if we can get an equally
strong positive reaction.
What kind of test?
Well, we sing to it,
and we talk to it,
and say supportive,
nurturing things to it.
You're not sleeping with it,
are you, Ray?
Oh, you.
It's always
the quiet ones.
You hound.
How about
the kinetic tests?
Okay.
Ordinary
household toaster.
We'll take your word
for that.
It responds to music,
so we've been doing
some experimentation,
playing easy listening,
middle-of-the-road type stuff.
You know, Paul Young,
That works okay.
Works for me.
Loves Jackie Wilson.
You guys do this at night
when I'm not here?
Oh, I get it, it sings.
It sounds exactly like Jackie.
That's fantastic.
Just watch.
Does it do Emmylou Harris?
Oh, it dances too!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Shake it up!
Yeah!
Oh, baby.
You're my number one
Christmas boutique
gift item!
Right, and the first time
somebody gets mad,
the toaster could
eat their hand.
No, no, no, no.
We put a warning label on it,
Ow, did you ever go for it.
The old man-eating
toaster bit.
Get off!
PETER: Hello?
I'm looking for Dana Barrett.
Room 304.
Restoration.
Thank you.
Hey, uh,
Dr. Venkman!
Yes.
That's right.
How you doin'?
I'm a big,
big fan of yours.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
That used to be
one of my two favorite shows.
You're kidding me.
Oh, great.
What was the other one?
It's a fishing show.
Yeah. I know
sure.
You're good,
pretty eyes.
I didn't paint it,
I'm just cleaning it.
It's a Gauguin.
Well, I've heard of him.
Well...
Dana, aren't you
going to introduce me
to your friend?
Um, sure.
Peter Venkman, this is
Dr. Janosz Poha,
the head
of our department.
Yes, I of course
have seen you
on the television.
Quite enjoy.
Uh, you're not here
on business, I hope.
Well, it's top secret.
Say, Johnny, you got
a Gauguin too!
No, actually I am
preparing this portrait
for the new
romantic exhibition.
This is prince Vigo,
the ruler of Carpathia
and Moldavia.
Bit of a sissy,
isn't he?
He was a very
powerful magician,
Dr. Venkman.
And a genius in many ways.
He was also a lunatic
and a genocidal madman.
I hate this painng.
I felt
uncomfortable ever since
it came up from storage.
Well, you're probably
feeling what Vigo is feeling.
Carpathian kitten loss.
He's missed his kitten.
We'll put one in here
by the castle.
We don't go around altering
valuable art, Dr. Venkman.
Go. Yes, I think go.
The joyfulness is over.
He's kidding
Well, you're not
gonna get a green card
with that attitude, pal, okay?
I don't know what...
Oh, of course, of course.
I get it. You're sweet
on this hunky stud,
aren't ya?
You know, Peter,
every now and then,
I get the feeling that,
that painting
is watching me,
even smiling at me.
You know, I think
we got more food
on your shirt
than we did
in your mouth.
Bath.
You're gonna take
a bath, aren't you?
Do your favorite thing.
You know what
you get to do?
You know what's more fun
than anything, huh?
Splash Mommy.
Yeah, you get
to splash Mommy, yes.
I'm gonna be ready for it
this time.
Mommy's gonna take
her shirt off, too.
Yeah.
No!
DANA: Peter, it's me.
Please let us in.
What the hell is this?
Peter, let us in, please!
I didn't know
where else to go.
The most awful thing happened.
The bathtub...
The bathtub was trying
to eat Oscar.
I was giving him a bath,
there was all this
pink ooze everywhere,
and it was reaching for him.
Okay, you're all right.
I'm not gonna let 'em
get you.
All right,
you're all safe now, okay?
Everybody's fine now.
He's so terrified.
You guys sit down
and relax, huh?
Yes, darling, I'm so sorry.
Come on, just sit down.
I'll get you guys
a shirt or something.
Ray. Yeah,
Dana's just come over
to my place.
Well, actually,
her tub tried to eat her.
RAY: What?
Are you serious?
Well, that's great!
I mean, that's terrible.
But it's great
for what we would...
Yeah, I will.
Sure, we'll get right on it.
Spengler.
Major slime-related
psycho-kinetic event.
What happened?
Something came
out of Dana's bathtub.
Tried to grab
her and the baby.
Are they all right?
Yeah, well,
she got out of there
and went over to Venkman's.
This is interesting, Ray.
Remember the painting
Venkman mentioned?
I ran the name
Vigo the Carpathian through
the occult reference net.
Look what came up.
Nice ugly history.
You think there's a connection
between this Vigo character
and the...
Slime?
Is the atomic weight
of cobalt 58.9?
Better get over
to Dana's apartment.
I'd like to check out
that bathtub.
It might be a good idea
to go to the museum
in the morning,
get a look
at that painting.
Ray's going to go
on over to your place
and just take a look.
He is?
Okay.
I have been
holding on to this
for a long time, Oscar.
I got this
from a girl
who got this
from Joe Willie Namath, okay?
We don't know how,
we don't wanna know.
So I would appreciate it
if you would not
hose this thing down,
you know?
Give it your own
personal rinse?
Thank you.
It'd be an excellent time
for you to start practicing
a thing we big guys
like to call self control.
Get out of here.
Oh, look at him.
Oh, look at his gut.
Oh, he's a coconut,
this guy.
Whoop!
You're going to be
staying at Uncle Pete's
until this thing blows over.
This is your place now.
Hi. Come on in,
this is my place.
So, how are we gonna handle
the sleeping arrangements?
Well, what's best
for me is
if I lie on my side like this
and you spoon up beside me,
your arm draped over me.
We do it the other way,
I get your hair
caught in my throat,
and I choke
in the night.
Well, how about you
on the sofa and me
and the baby in the bed?
It's a way to go.
It's so late.
I really ought
to put him down.
May I?
Yeah, if you want to.
You're short,
your belly button
sticks out too far,
and you're
a terrible burden
on your poor mother.
Find anything at Dana's?
Nah, nothing but mood slime
residue around the bathtub.
But I did get something
on that Vigo character
you mentioned.
Found it in Leon Zundinger's
Dig that.
Vigo the Carpathian,
born 1505, died 1610.
he hung in there,
didn't he?
He didn't die
of old age, either.
He was poisoned, stabbed,
shot, hung, stretched,
disemboweled,
drawn and quartered.
Ouch.
WINSTON: I guess he wasn't
too popular at the end, huh?
No, not exactly
a man of the people.
Also known as
Vigo the cruel,
Vigo the torturer,
Vigo the despised,
and Vigo the unholy.
Wasn't he also
Vigo the butch?
And dig this.
There was a prophecy.
Just before his head died,
his last words were,
"Death is but a door,
"time is but a window.
I'll be back."
Let's suck in the guts,
guys, we're the Ghostbusters.
No! No,
please go. You!
Who's this wiggler?
He's yours, Ray.
Sic him.
I have discussed this
with you...
Hi, how are you?
Ray Stantz
from the Ghostbusters.
I tell you, and I told
your friend.
Beautiful art you have here.
We're just doing
a routine spook check.
Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.
Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
So why are you came?
Well, we got a report
there was a major
creep in the area,
we checked our list,
and you were
right on the top.
Johnny, where in the hell
are you from, anyway?
The Upper West Side.
The whole room's
extremely hot, Peter.
Ew, that's one
ugly dude.
Well, that's Vigo.
Mr. Vigo, Veegs, would you
look this way, please?
Please, no don't...
No, no!
Come on,
show me something!
Mr. Vigo...
No photographs, please!
Slides are available
in the gift shop, eh?
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you, Winston.
All right, I think...
You know what?
Give me angry, will ya?
Will you give me angry,
you've had a bad day,
you're cranky?
Yeah, thank you.
Good, good.
Ooh, angrier.
Ooh, I'm scared.
You're scaring me,
stop it.
Yeah, good! Okay,
walk for me, talk for me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Okay, give me hot and sexy.
Can you do it?
You can. Oh, boy.
Show me some teeth,
come on.
I bet the girls like ya, huh?
Do the girls?
Do the guys?
Bet they both do.
What about the animals?
They like ya?
That's it, more.
Yeah, come on.
You're big, you're big.
All right, destroy me!
Destroy me now, yeah!
Destroy me!
Yeah! Yeah!
Venkman...
Yeah, give it!
Yeah! Yeah!
We need to talk.
Come on.
I've worked with better.
But not many.
Thank you.
John, thanks.
Hey. Hey!
Huh?
Hey, you finished?
Yeah, I'm
finished here.
Are you all right?
What?
I mean, you're not
coming down with something?
Me?
Dana?
Your prince.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
She cleaned.
Hi.
Hi.
Shh, he's asleep.
Come here.
So, what happened
with my apartment?
Well, the guys spent
the whole night there.
They went through
all your things,
your personal stuff.
They tried on
some of your clothes,
made some
long-distance phone calls,
cleaned out the fridge...
Did they find anything?
They found a little bit
of that pink slime.
Oh, God.
Well, what am I
supposed to do now?
You are supposed to get
dressed and get crazy
with me on the streets
of Manhattan tonight.
Peter, I don't think that...
This is exactly
what you need.
I have got you
a baby-sitter.
The whole thing's wired.
Peter, I don't think
we should go out on a date,
you know,
and I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place
with a strange person.
Strange person?
Janine Melnitz
from my staff.
Janine has experience
baby-sitting?
Here.
Thank you.
I've also
brought some things
from your apartment.
Some wardrobe choices,
couple of provocative
ensembles in here,
I'll leave it up to you.
Okay. But after dinner,
don't put any of those
old cheap moves on me, okay?
No, no, no.
It's different.
I have all new cheap moves.
DANA: Hey, you!
Hey, you!
It looks like
you're awake, huh?
You're awake!
Yes, Osco.
You're gonna
have the whole place
to yourself tonight, pal.
It's gonna be
pretty neat.
I got some Laura Antonelli
tapes if you wanna watch 'em.
Dana, did you see some shirts
here in the floor-bed area?
Yeah, I put 'em
in the hamper.
I have a hamper?
It's in the bathroom.
Neat.
Will you tell me next time
you're gonna do that,
though, please?
Well, I thought
they were dirty.
I have more than two grades
of laundry, okay?
There's not just
clean and dirty,
there are many
subtle levels, okay?
You hang this outside
the window for 20 minutes,
it's perfectly fine.
Interesting role model
for you, Oscar, huh?
Well, they couldn't get to you
until after the new year.
Well, just
don't go in there.
Louis, I'm closing up.
I don't know,
should I take the subway,
or surface roads, or what?
It's kind of busy out.
Well, I'm walking.
Good night.
Well now, well, well,
well, hang on, now.
Do you maybe wanna...
Uh, no, no.
Do you wanna have
something to eat with me?
Yeah, I'd love that,
but I--I--I--I...
I told Dr. Venkman
I'd baby-sit for him.
Oh, oh.
Do you want
to baby-sit with me?
Okay, I would.
Great.
His place at 8:00.
Bye.
His place at 8:00.
All right. well, I can get
his address from the W-2...
MAN: Hey, buddy,
move it!
EGON:
We were right, Ray.
Multiplanar
kirlian emanations.
Yeah? Well, here's your
next month's cover of
Check out the aura
on this sucker.
Now, there's definitely
a living presence there.
We should get
a deeper look.
Why don't I run
this wider shot through
the spectronalyzer?
Good, I'll try turning up
the roentgens.
Okay.
So, what do you think?
Chinese?
How about Thai?
No, too spicy.
Greek?
Uh, Mexican?
Pizza.
Thin or thick?
Chicago.
What the hell is that?
I know what it is.
I've seen it before.
Where?
When you guys had me dangling
like a worm on a hook
That's the river
of slime.
What the...
Uh, Ray...
We need a blanket
or a hose or something!
Let's get out.
What the...
This is closed!
Winston!
BOTH: Winston! Fire!
RAY: What're we gonna do?
Put our heads in the toilet?
Taxi!
Pete, it's great
that you're here.
We've got incredible news!
Wait a minute.
Can I have one try?
All-you-can-eat
barbecue rib night
at the Sizzler?
No, we analyzed the photos
you took of Vigo.
The spectrogram shows
a river of slime
flowing behind him.
RAY: Just like
I saw underground.
Now we're going into
the subway and sewer system
to see if we can trace
the source of the flow.
Yeah, come on,
change your clothes.
We'll wait for you.
Egon thinks there might even
be a tremendous breeding surge
in the cockroach population.
Hi, boys.
What's up?
Hi.
Hi.
Dana, the guys are going
down into the sewer
to check for slime stuff,
and Egon thinks
there may even be a huge surge
in cockroach breeding.
Wanna blow off
this dinner thing
and go with them?
Taxi!
Women, huh?
WINSTON: Will you
watch your step?
I hate this.
According to
this old transit map,
there should be
an entrance anywhere
along here somewhere.
I'm not getting
anything yet.
Well, at least it's too dark
to see the cockroaches.
Forget about cockroaches.
It's the subway rats
you've gotta worry about.
Big as beavers.
Yeah, some of 'em
go four or five kilos.
Hey, hey!
Enough, all right?
Listen, you hear 'em,
behind the walls,
scratching?
There must be
thousands of 'em.
Just shut up
about the rats.
Okay, okay.
Hello!
Hey!
Hello!
MONSTER: Winston!
WINSTON: Okay,
I'm out of here!
Uh, they're gone.
What the...
Before we go any further,
I think we should get
our proton packs.
Uh-huh.
Good idea.
Yeah.
What's that?
What's what?
Sounds like a train.
Uh-uh. These lines have
been abandoned for 50 years.
Oh.
Probably in one
of the tunnels above us.
I don't know.
It sounds awfully
close to me.
I think that was
the old New York
Central city of Albany!
Derailed in 1920.
Killed hundreds of people.
Did you catch the number
on the locomotive?
Sorry.
I missed it.
Something's trying to stop us.
We must be close.
Where's Ray?
Ray?
Ray!
Ray!
Ray?
Ray?
Ray!
RAY: Guys!
Oh, sorry.
I found it.
What?
Right here.
There's a hole!
Let's go.
Hey, fellas.
What about the packs?
EGON:
Unbelievable.
I tell ya?
I wasn't lyin', was I?
Do you know how much negative
energy it must have taken
to generate
a flow this size?
Hey, New York.
What a town.
All right, let's see
how deep it is.
Get a sounding.
All right,
six feet.
Twelve feet.
Something's pulling it!
EGON: Hold on!
Hold on!
I'm tryin' to hold it.
Give me a hand!
Give me a hand!
Give me a hand!
Something's got it.
Hold it!
Hold it, hold it!
Wait, wait!
A toast to the most
charming, kindest...
Oh, it's me.
It's you.
And most unusual man
I've ever broken up with.
Speaking of breaking up
with neat guys,
why did you dump me?
I didn't dump you,
I was protecting myself.
I mean, you weren't
very good for me, you know.
You know that,
don't you?
Hmm. Well, heck.
I'm not even good
for me.
You're much better
than you realize.
You don't give yourself
enough credit.
I need to hear
that kind of stuff.
I could have myself
whipped into shape
by the end of this century.
Well, why don't you
just give me a jingle
in the year 2000?
Why don't I give you
a jingle right now?
So the seven little dwarves
had a limited partnership
in a small mining operation.
One day, a beautiful princess
came to live with them.
They bartered housekeeping
services for room and board,
which was a real good deal
for them, because they
didn't have to withhold
social security or income tax
or nothin',
which you're really not
supposed to do, you see,
but for the purposes
of this story,
I think, it's okay.
This really is
a great place.
I mean, it needs
a woman's touch,
but I think it looks
really good, you know.
Shh, bedtime.
You're very good
with children.
Thanks, I practiced
on my hamster.
Oh.
So, you live alone?
I used to have a roommate,
but my mom moved to Florida.
Oh.
Why don't you come over here
and sit with me?
Okay.
So, you wanna play Boggle
or Super Mario Brothers?
No.
I think motherhood's
a very natural instinct.
I'd like a child myself.
Would you?
Tonight?
Nice goin', Ray.
What're you tryin' to do?
Drown me?
Oh, yeah, Zeddemore,
like it was my fault!
But you were too stupid
not to drop that plumb line!
Stupid? You better watch
your mouth, or I'll punch
your lights out!
Oh, yeah?
Anytime, come on!
Yeah! Right now!
It's go time, man!
I want you bad!
Wait! Wait!
Stop, stop!
Get your clothes off,
quick.
Oh, dear, Ray.
What're we doin'?
I was ready to kill you!
It's the stuff.
It's like pure,
concentrated evil!
And it's all flowing
right to this spot.
WINSTON: Oh, are you sure
this is it?
Yeah, he said Arnold's.
Excuse me,
sorry, we're with...
Venkman!
It's absolutely
incredible!
The greatest tangible
evidence of psychic energy...
Just a second...
Boys, boys!
You're scaring
the straights, okay?
Is there any way
we can do this tomorrow?
This won't wait until
tomorrow, Venkman.
It's hot,
and it's ready to pop!
Yeah, it's all over
the city, Pete.
Under it, actually.
Rivers of the stuff.
Yes, and it's all flowing
right to the museum.
Yeah, the museum.
Oh, it got all over me!
What is this stuff?
Sorry.
Oh, God!
You mean my museum?
I was going to tell you
between dessert and
the cheese course.
There they are!
You can never
go back there again.
You're gonna have
to find a new job...
Psycho-magnatheric plasm...
I'm glad they're here.
We gotta see the mayor!
Oh, Ghostbusters!
How you doin'?
Hey guys, come right
this way!
Hey, you guys got another one
of those proton packs?
My kid brother
really wants one.
The proton pack
is not a toy.
I guess he's right.
Oh, Dana, we were just
baby-sittin', honest!
And we watched some TV,
Louis...
and we had somethin' to eat,
and one thing lead to another.
That's all right.
I know what you were doing.
Hi, Dana.
How was your date?
Well, it wasn't a date,
it was just dinner.
Where's Peter?
Well, he was arrested.
Typical.
Did he call?
No, no, nobody called.
Well, how's Oscar?
Is he all right?
Oh. Oh, he's fine.
Such a good baby.
He was a little fussy
at first,
then we just gave him some
French bread pizza...
Passed right out.
Good. Good.
Well, I'll just give him
a look-see.
So, you think
we should go?
Gee, I don't know.
I don't think we should
leave her alone.
You're right.
Let's stay.
Lenny, big man!
Ghostbusters.
Mr. Mayor.
What is this?
A slumber party?
RAY: Well,
that's what we're here
to talk to y about.
EGON: Excuse our appearance,
sir...
Look, I don't wanna hear
anything about it.
You've got two minutes.
Make it good.
Uh, well, uh,
first of all, Mr. Mayor,
it's a great pleasure
to see you again.
We'd just like to say that
almost 50 percent of us voted
for you in the last election.
I appreciate that.
I'm just sorry
we have to always meet
under these circumstances.
Mr. Mayor, we are
here tonight
because
a psycho-magnatheric
slime flow
of immense proportions
is building up
beneath this city.
Psycho-what?
Psycho-magnatheric.
Big word.
Negative human emotions
are materializing in
the form of a viscous,
psycho-reactive plasm
with explosive
supernormal potential.
Does anybody
speak English here?
WINSTON:
Uh, yeah, Your Honor.
See,
what we're tryin' to tell you
is all the bad feelings.
I mean, all the hate,
the anger, and violence
in this city
is turning
into this sludge.
I didn't believe it at first.
But we just went
for a swim in it,
and we ended up almost
killing each other!
This is insane!
Do we really have
to listen to this?
Can't you stop
your lips from flapping
for two little minutes?
Lenny, have you been out
on the street lately?
Do you know how weird
it is out there?
We've taken
our own head count.
There seem to be three million
completely miserable assholes
living in
the tri-state area!
Oh, please.
I beg your pardon.
Three million and one.
Hey!
What fudgy brain here
doesn't realize
is that if we don't
do something fast,
this whole place
is gonna blow like
a frog on a hot plate!
Yeah, right!
What am I supposed to do?
Go on television and tell
ten million people
they have to be nice
to each other?
Being miserable and treating
other people like dirt
is every New Yorker's
God-given right!
Your two minutes are up!
Good night, gentlemen.
Wait...
You're making
a big mistake, Mr. Mayor!
PETER:
A very newsworthy mistake!
You know    is gonna
be interested in this,
and you know the
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, now...
"Times Square slimed"?
"Slime square!"
"Slime square!"
Fine, fine.
Now, before you go
running off to
the newspapers with this,
would you consider telling
this slime business to some
of our people downtown?
It's gotta be done
right away.
You know the expression
"it all comes back"?
Well, it's gonna come back!
This city's in danger!
The whole state
the whole world!
All we wanna do
is help...
Let's go, come on.
Go!
Uh, the mayor wants them kept
under strict observation
for the next few days.
We think they're
seriously disturbed
and potentially dangerous.
Well, we'll do
whatever's necessary.
Thank you, Doctor.
Mmm-hmm.
I await the word of Vigo!
I, Vigo, the scourge
of Carpathia...
I know, you told me this.
The scourge.
The sorrow of Moldavia...
Sorrows. I've heard
all of this, yes.
Command you.
Command me, lord!
The season of evil
begins with the birth
of the new year.
Good!
Bring me the child
that I might live again!
Yes!
Lord Vigo,
I was wondering...
Uh, this woman, Dana,
is fine and strong.
Now,
if I was to, uh,
bring the baby,
could I have that woman?
So be it.
On this day of darkness
she will be ours.
Wife to you
and mother to me!
Yes!
Thank you, lord!
Thank you!
JANINE: I mean, is like,
she the killer, or what?
LOUIS: No,
that's Rita Hayworth.
Right after they were
finished, she dumped him
for some polo player.
I don't know
why beautiful women
love horses so much.
Do you love horses?
No.
You know,
you really don't
have to stay.
I'm sure
Peter will be back soon.
LOUIS: Oh, we don't mind.
Can you see okay?
Yep.
DANA: Oscar?
Oh, God!
Oscar!
Louis!
What!
It's Oscar!
Oscar.
Call 911 right now!
Oscar!
Oh, no!
No, no, no!
No!
It was a ghost!
No, that was Janosz.
He took him!
JANINE: What's happening?
What should we do?
Where's the baby?
The museum!
Where're you goin'?
I've gotta
get my baby!
We gotta
find the guys!
As I explained before,
we think the spirit
of a 17th-century
Moldavian tyrant
is alive and well
in a painting at
the Manhattan museum of art.
Uh-huh. And are there
any other paintings
in the museum
with bad spirits in them?
You're wasting
valuable time.
He's drawing strength
from a psycho-magnatheric
slime flow
that's been collecting
under the city.
Yes, tell me
about the slime.
It's very potent stuff.
We made a toaster
dance with it,
and a bathtub tried
to eat his friend's baby.
A bathtub.
Don't look at me.
I think these people
are completely nuts.
Oscar!
Sweetheart!
Oh, Oscar,
I thought
I'd lost you!
Oh, baby!
Hello, Dana.
I thought that
you might come.
You stay away
from us, Janosz.
I mean it!
Don't worry.
He will not be harmed!
He has been chosen
to be the vessel
of the spirit of Vigo!
And you will be the mother
of the ruler of the world!
Doesn't that sound nice?
No, it sounds
ludicrous.
You stay away
from him. I mean it.
I don't think
we have choice here.
Take a look
that's not Gainsborough's
there.
Huh?
It's Vigo!
I don't care who he is.
You're not gonna take
my baby!
DANA: Oscar!
Oh, you bastard!
Is this a big dinosaur
or a little dinosaur?
Oh, it's a skeleton, huh?
Well, which way
was it heading?
Wait a second.
What was chasing you
in the park?
The park bench
was chasing you?
I see.
What? Wait a sec.
Lieutenant, I think you
better talk to this guy.
I'm busy here!
It's some dock supervisor
down at pier 34.
What's the problem?
He says the
just arrived.
Well, better late
than never.
Battery is swamped!
We've had
more than 3,000 calls
since midnight last night!
We've got every man
in uniform on the streets,
and I am still
shorthanded.
We got meter maids
chasing ghosts
all over midtown.
There's this shell thing over
the Manhattan museum of art.
We can't make a dent.
Have you tried dynamite?
We've tried everything.
What the hell's
going on?
It's pandemonium out there!
Yes, I know.
We're working on it.
Great.
While you're working on it,
I'm going down
in history as the mayor
who let New York
get sucked down
into the tenth level of hell.
All right.
We've got no choice.
Call the Ghostbusters.
Wait!
Now, I'm sure
there's another way.
Jack, I spent an hour
last night in my bedroom
talking to
Fiorello La Guardia,
and he's been dead
for 40 years!
Now, where are
the Ghostbusters?
They're not available.
What do you mean,
they're not available?
Well, I had
them committed
to the psychiatric ward
at Parkview hospital.
You what?
They were threatening
to go to the press.
I was protecting
your interests!
Oh, yeah?
Well you can stop
protecting my interests.
You have exactly three minutes
to clear out. You're fired!
But the election!
Harry!
Remove this man
from the building!
You're making a mistake.
And get me the Ghostbusters!
MAN: Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Come take a look at this.
Wow, what is it?
Have you ever seen
anything like that?
Somebody get me
the Ghostbusters!
And then he took the baby,
and he put it in a carriage,
and then levitated away!
What did Dana do?
Where did she go?
She said she was
going to the museum
to get the baby!
And then there was
an eclipse,
and the whole town went dark,
and everybody's nuts!
See, it all fits.
Vigo wants in
on the 21st century.
He needs
a human body to inhabit.
Little Oscar must be it.
WINSTON: I bet
we're the only ones
who can do anything, right?
RAY: You bet we are!
It looks like
a giant Jell-O mold!
I hate Jell-O.
C'mon, there's always
room for Jell-O.
JANOSZ:
Soon it will be midnight,
and the city will be mine
and Vigo's!
Well, mainly Vigo's.
Oh, Dana,
you and I have this
terrific opportunity
to make the best
of this relationship.
We don't have
a relationship.
I know!
Marry me, Dana!
Together, we will raise
Vigo as our son!
And let me tell you something,
here.
There are many perks in being
the mother of a living god.
I'm sure we could get
a magnificent apartment,
a car, free parking...
Many marriages begin
with a certain amount
of distance,
but I think that
you and I could learn
to love each other.
Yes.
I could learn.
Pull 'em.
Full neutrons.
Let's cook!
Save 'em!
That slime wall is
pulsing with evil!
It would take a tremendous
amount of positive energy
to crack that shell,
and I seriously doubt that
there's enough good will
left in this town to do it.
I just can't believe
things have gotten
so bad in this city
that there's no way back!
I mean, sure, it's dirty,
it's crowded, it's polluted,
it's noisy,
and there's people all around
who'd just as soon
step on your face
as look at you.
But, come on,
there've got to be
a few sparks of sweet humanity
left in this burned-out burg!
We just have to figure out
a way to mobilize it!
EGON: He's right.
We need something
that everyone in this town
can get behind, we need...
A symbol.
Something that appeals
to the best in each
and every one of us.
Something good.
Something decent.
Something pure.
PETER:
Kind of makes you wonder,
doesn't it?
EGON: Wonder what?
PETER: Whether she's naked
under that toga.
She's French.
You know that.
EGON: Got it!
Ready with the speakers, Ray.
Slime blowers ready?
Audio's set!
Electric's set!
Slime blower
primed and set!
Oh, good slime,
good slime!
Winston, is our slime
in a good mood tonight?
I hope so.
She's a lot bigger
than a toaster.
All yours, Venkman.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Hey, let's frost it.
It's slime time.
Beautiful!
RAY: Pilot controls
are ready.
All right, it's getting late
it's almost midnight.
Let's go, Venkman.
RAY: Man, I can't wait
to see people's faces
when we come onshore!
This should really get
the city's positive energy
flowing, huh, Venky?
PETER: Keep kickin', Libby.
You make this work, we'll pop
for a weekend in Vegas
with the Jolly Green Giant.
You look fantastic
in this.
I was born
to wear this stuff.
Boy, this equipment's heavy.
It's a love fest,
New York!
Sing it out!
Your love is
lifting me higher
Come on, you sing!
EGON: We're running out
of time, Ray.
PETER: Can't you
go any faster?
RAY: I'm afraid the vibrations
will shake her to pieces!
You should have
padded her feet.
I don't think they make
Nike's in her size, Ray.
Oh, don't worry. She's tough!
She's a harbor chick!
Sorry! My fault!
Happy New Year!
Stay fit, keep sharp,
make good decisions.
Oh, good. Oh, good.
Oh, good. Oh, good. Okay.
Oh, it's you!
Okay, but I didn't know
you had your license!
Four minutes to go,
and then party times!
JANOSZ: It's happening
it's really happening!
No, no.
Go away from here!
I love you
when you rough-out!
Hit it, mama!
Drop the hammer on her!
Oh, Oscar, look!
Go away!
Do you know
who that is?
Happy New Year!
He's Vigo!
You are like the buzzing
of flies to him!
Oh, Johnny, did you back
the wrong horse.
Will you hose him, please?
Hose him.
One down.
On the ground.
Boy, am I glad
to see you!
Oh, Oscar, Oscar!
Is he dead?
Uh-uh, this slime
is positively charged.
He'll wake up feeling
like a million bucks.
Whoa, this gentleman is
a little bit ripe.
That's all right, my friend.
I think I had an accident too.
Get him away!
RAY: Go get a knife
or something!
We've gotta cut her
out of this!
Okay.
All right, now listen.
You've gotta stay right here.
Don't move!
Uncle Pete's gotta go help
your mom for a second.
You stay right here,
and don't say anything,
okay?
Uh-oh.
Hold it right there,
Deadhead!
You want a baby?
Go ahead and knock up
some willing hellhound!
Otherwise, I'm giving you
three to get back in that
painting where you belong!
One!
Two!
Three!
You've got him.
You've got him!
That was
really stupid!
Ray, can you move?
No. Are you okay?
No. Venkman,
how are you?
I'm fine.
No! No! Oscar!
Please, do something!
PETER: Not so fast, Vigo!
Hey, Vigo! Yeah, you!
The bimbo with the baby.
Didn't anybody tell you
the big shoulder look is out?
You know, I have met
some dumb blonds in myife,
but you take the taco, pal.
Only a Carpathian would
come back to life now
and choose New York.
Tasty pick, bonehead!
If you had brain one
in that huge melon
on top of your neck,
you would be livin'
the sweet life
out in Southern California's
beautiful San Fernando valley.
Oh, darn.
Darn it!
Now we become one!
Where's that singing
coming from?
People outside.
Excuse me.
Ghostbusters!
Wow!
I'm here with ya, guys!
He's weakening!
The singing is neutralizing
the slime!
I can move!
Oscar!
Oh, sweetie!
He's back in the painting!
All right, go find
a shady spot.
Viggy, Viggy, Viggy!
You have been
a bad monkey!
Ray, we'd like
to shoot the monster.
Could you move, please?
Ray.
Ray!
Ray!
No! I, Ray, am Vigo
shall rule the earth!
Be gone,
you pitiful half-men!
Now!
I did it! I did it!
That was great!
I'm a Ghostbusters!
WINSTON: You all right?
EGON: Come on, get up.
Let's get this off you.
There. Here we go.
Whoa, how do you feel?
Groovy.
You all right?
Yes. Thank you,
Peter.
Scram, shorty.
I love you guys.
I love all you guys.
Great, Ray.
And I love Venkman.
Uh-huh. Let's go.
We gotta live
with this?
Wow, real friendship.
Yeah.
And we'll come
from behind
EGON: Hey.
Are you all right?
Why am I drippings with goo?
You had a violent,
prolonged transformative
psychic episode.
Huh?
Sorry we had
to hose you there, but you
were kind of out of control.
Hey, man, let me
tell you somethin'.
I love you.
Yes?
Yeah.
Well, I love
you too!
Hey, fellas.
You wanna take a look
at this?
Wow!
Early renaissance,
I think.
Raphael, or
Piero Della Francesca?
No, I believe it's
one of the Fettuccini's.
CROWD:
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
