Okay, Billy Badass,

Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it ''The Stranger.''
What I do is, I sit on my hand
for like 1 5, 20 minutes...
untilitgoes numb,
no feeling atall.
And then... I rub one out.
The Stranger, huh ?
It's like a little boys' nursery
school I've come upon here.
Where are they ?

Sweetie, you're so talented.

All gone. We didn't get
a single one of'em.
And we are talking
about professionals.
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions.
And, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.
This is one ofthree
brand-new Mercedes,
a car they say
is unstealable.
Yeah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key...
sent directly to the U.S.
dealer from Hamburg.
They got somebody
working on the inside.

Let's impound these cars for

control, vision, determination.
These are the three
fundamental components...
ofthe new generation
race car driver.
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fast.
But remember: The car is you,
you are the car.
Okay ? Let's ride !
Billy, youjust shaved
one second offyour lap time !
Tommy, I don't know what
that was, but it wasn't driving.
Go get 'em !
Well, well, well. What doyou pay
your pit crews with ?
Oreos and Gummy Bears ?
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What areyou doing here ?
- Is there someplace we can talk ?
- About what ?
Aboutyour brother
and the deep shit he's in.
Frank, can you watch
the kids for a minute ?
Tell me about Kip.
He took ajob,
and he fumbled it.
Now he'sjammed up.
He'sjammed up bad.
- What kind ofjob ?
- A boost. A big boost.
A boost ?
What's Kip doing on a boost ?
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.
Kip's become quite
the little crew runner sinceyou left.
You don't talk toyour ma ?
She neglected to mention it.
Listen, I need something.
I-I need something
cold to drink.
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.
- Who was thejob for ?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.
They call him
''The Carpenter.''
He's runnin' all the dark
ponies down there now.
It's a full-on '' Devil came
down to Long Beach'' trip.
He's bad.
He's real bad.
And this Calitri is the one
who's after my brother ?
Like stains on a mattress.
And you should know...
I work for him.
There weren't a lot ofopportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.
He put me to work.
I-I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out ofeven me.
What areyou doin', man ?
Stop ! Stop !
AtleyJackson.
Gotit. Theyhave Kip.
Take me there.
Raymond Calitri,
Memphis Raines.
-
- I try...
to learn yourways,
understand your obsessions.
But this baseball--
it's sobleeding boring, isn'tit ?
Where's my brother ?
Memphis Raines,
your legend precedes you.
Atley tells me
you're the best.
Afteryouleft, auto theftin the
South Bayarea wentdown 47percent.
Where's my brother ?
I'm proudofthese. Straddle chair
from theArts andcraftsperiod.
Mahogany table
with cloud-lift pattern.
Blackwalnut wine table.
Metal's cold, ugly.
Wood's warm, clean,
providedbynature.
See a piece offurniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.
I asked you a question.
They threw us out of England,
threw us out of France,
but here we are,
flourishing really,
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything aboutyour country.
On this listyou'll fi nd
I need all 50 delivered
to Long Beach Harbor, pier 1 4
by 8:00 a.m. four days from now.
I'm paying $200,000.
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.
Young Kip came to me.
He had street cred.
The brother ofthe notorious
Memphis Raines.
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $1 0,000.
Atley told me. Ifit's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.
The debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me toyou.
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it ?
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would.
Because ifI don't, my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.
Am I an asshole ?
Do I look like an asshole ?
Yeah.
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.
And where the hell
is my brother ?
I made this as well.
My fi rst one.
It takes 80,000 pounds
ofpressure to crush a car.
- Kip ?
- Who's that ?
- Memphis.
- Oh, shit.
You okay ?
Shut it off !
- Turn itoff!
- You've got 30 seconds
to consideryour options.
- Shut it off !
- One: You kill me; they kill you.
- Your brother dies anyway.
-
Two: You lie, you accept thejob,
you takeyour brother, you run.
I huntyou down, I kill you, I kill
your brother, and I kill your mother...
for the aggravation
you've caused me.
Three: Youaccept the deal,
youstealsome cars,
you make some money
and you be a big brother.
- Memphis !
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.
The cars are on the boat,
oryour brother's in the coffi n.
Getme outta here !
Somebodygetme outta here.
Listen, youreally don't
have tomakemeanything.
Oh, hey, you come down here.
You saved my ass.
It's the least I can do.
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas
someplace up North or something, right ?
- Yeah, working with kids.
- Oh, really ?
'' First place.''
I remember this.
Oh, yeah, that was--
that was a long time ago.
What'd you put in it ?
I don't know.
It's good.
Ow. Ow. Oh, God.
Does Mom know
about any ofthis ?
No, no, no, she doesn't,
and I don't think she should.
You know, she-- she works
really hard, and this-- this--
She doesn't need to know
about any ofthis stuff.
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.
Kitchen's on fi re.
Uh, man.
Hey, Memphis.
It's good to seeyou.
Haul the cartons overthere !
- Hey, Fuzzy.
- Aw, shit. What areyou doin' here ?
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, butyou're a liar.
- You're gonna get me fi red, man.
- Fired ? That's not good.
You're on parole, right ?
Fuzzy, hey, nobody
wants to getyou fi red.
Wejust need this
information is all.
Two weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot oftop-end cars.
- And who made that call ?
- I don't have a clue.
- Okay. We should go talk toyour boss.
- Oh, shhh.
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.
- And when is that ?
- Thursday, Friday, end ofthe week.
Well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, orwe'll be back.
Good to seeyou, buddy.
Thankyou.

I'm looking
for Helen Raines.

You look so good.
Thankyou, Momma. Here.
Spring-- Spring bouquet.
What areyou doing here ?
Well, uh, AtleyJackson

Told me something about Kip.
Can I helpyou
with one ofthese ?
Okay, that'syours.
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
whojust walked into the Quality Cafe.
I can't say I'm surprised.
All his life he looked up toyou,
tried to beyou.
I guess now he is.
So why is this happening ?
I send you guys money.
He-- He met some people,
and he changed.
He lost that--
that sweetness, you know ?
Okay... tell me.
How deep in is he ?
Deep.
Can you get him out ?
It means doin' things,
things I told you
I'd never do again.
Do what it takes, Randall.
When didyougetinto town, Raines ?
- Last night.
- Last night ? What for ?
I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.
Heard we got Shaquille.
-
- Guys wanna go ?
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall, come here.
I get this call from this
uniform, you know ?
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.
This man calls me up, says, ''Guess
who's back in town ?'' I say, ''Who ?''
He says, ''Randall Raines. ''
Isay, ''Randall Raines the carthief?''
He says, ''Yeah.'' I say, ''Impossible.''
He says, '' No, he's back.''
I say, '' No, he's not.''
He says, ''Yes, I will betyou $200
I just saw Randall Raines.''
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective--
- No, whoa, whoa.
What's really, really
ironic about this--
Two nights ago we snare these
At the time I'm thinking,
''This feels like Randall Raines.''
Now, it didn't haveyour
panache, your, uh, flash,
but itjust felt
like Randall Raines.
Andnowhereyouare.
Look, I don't know
whatyou boys are looking for,
but I just got back, okay ?
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.
Family emergency. Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.
I gotta go tell mywoman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What ?
She can be mean.
Come here.
Come here, Randall.
Take those glasses off, Randall.
Please, do me a favor.
Sixyears agoyou make
a real smart move, you know ?
You retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed or maybe even both.
And I'm thinkin' that not putting
you awaywhen I had a chance...
is like this big bug up the ass ofthis
real impressive career that I've had.
Oh, yeah.
Well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.
Eleanor tell you that ?
Now, that's hittin'
below the belt.
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about below the belt, Randall.
From here on out, ifyou walk across
the street outside ofa crosswalk,
ifyou roll
through a stop sign,
ifyou use an aerosol can in
a manner other than directed--
I mean, I don't care,
you make one slip,
and I will putyou away
for good.
- Okay.
- By the timeyougetout, asshole,
there won't even be cars.
We'll all be cruising around
in your little, vroom, spaceships.
That's gonna suck.
Who's Eleanor ?
It's a damn car.
And don't ever
talk about mywife.
Excuse me.
You know where Otto is ?
- He's in the back, in the paint shop.
-
Is thatyou ? About time
you came to see me.
- I missed you.
- Good to seeyou !
You look great.

Hey,Junie.
How areyou ?
- We're doin' good, thankyou.

You look happy.
Well, I am happy.
I really am.
So what happened here ?
- What doyou mean ?
- Well, it's nice.
But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education.
What happened ? Hey.
Old age happened.
That's what happened.
Got tired ofkilling 'em.
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought,
''I'm no longer a destroyer.
I'm a means ofresurrection.''
Now we restore,
we revive.

Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.
- We can talk here.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.
Raymond Calitri.
He's ajackal tearing at the
soft belly ofour-- ofour fair town.
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.
I heard about Kip.
Areyou considering a comeback tour ?
- Doyou think it can be done ?
- Don't do this to me, okay ?
Please, please not now.
Oh, man.
- How many cars ?
- Fifty.
- How many days ?
- Three.
How many in your crew ?
One, but I came here
hoping to negotiate for a second.
No way.
It can't be done.
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.
Oh, man.
It was a mistake
to come here.
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.
Uh, waitaminute.
Uh, holdon.
Look around you.
These days...
I'm all about second chances.
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls,

We-- Mirror Man here,
he's an electronics expert.
You know, he's got some gadgets
that-- thatyou old farts
probably never heard of.
You know, uh, Tumbler over here,
he can pretty much drive
anything with wheels...
and, youknow,
some things without wheels.
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.
He's-- He does fascinating
things with computers.
What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby ?
I can hack
into the D.M.V. mainframe.
Ican change VINnumbers.
Ican changeaddresses, registrations.
I can do a lot
ofreally tricky stuff. I can.
All right, all right.
We do this, we do it myway.
I run the show.
You takeyour orders from me.
Ifyou have any problems
with that, you can leave now.
No, that's fi ne.
That's fi ne.
- Well, who is Gilligan here,
and what does he do ?
- Gilliganis actually Freb.
- Freb can order pizzas
like nobody's business.
- What ?
- It's true.
- Hey, people gotta eat, right ?
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.
All right,James,
that's an option.
And frankly,
a reasonable one.
Soyou call
your lawyer,James.
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion ofgrand theft auto.
- We indictyou.
- He'll bail you out.
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.
A kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.
- What's the kid's name ?
- We kept it anonymous.
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, looks like a boxer.
- What doyou want me to do ?
- When he comes back, you call us.
- What says he comes back ?
- A hunch.
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. deadline,
you're gonna have to go old school.
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket, okay ?
- One night ? What, areyou crazy ?
- Yes. No, I'm notcrazy.
- What, doyou have like
a better plan or something' ?
- Yeah, you spread it out.
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.
Otto, I'm sorry. Can youjust listen
to me for one second, all right ?
We heardyou, Kip. Shadowgames.
But whatyouhave to understand...
is that ifyou play shadow games, by
the second night, the heat is ontoyou.
With a one-night boost, by the time
the fi rst car's reported stolen,
your ship's set sail;
it's a surprise attack.
This is a complicated list,
fellas, it really is, okay ?
There are 25
thataren'taproblem,
but these exotics
are tough to fi nd.
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys, okay ?
- Yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered ?
- What'd I just say ?
Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah.
All right, all right.
Well, then let's get to work.
Toby, hack into
theinsurance database...
andfindas many cars
asyoucan.
Yes ! Igotaddresses
on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.
Donny, check the D.M. V. for
theremaining cars on thelist.
I'm sorry, miss, butyou've
missedfiive questions.
- That's a failing.
- No !

- No ! Why ?
You're supposed to go faster
when somebody tailgates you.
- Ah. Hello again.
- Mm-hmm. Here'syourlist...
ofthe 20 car owners' names and
addresses thatyou requested.
- Thankyou.
- That's $1 00, please.
- A hundred dollars ?
- Well, five dollars a car.
Twenty cars.
Would you like a calculator ?
It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.
My name's Roger, sir.
May I be ofsome help ?
That's funny, my name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.
-  Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes ?
I've been in L.A. for three months now.
I have money, I have taste.
But I'm not
on anybody's ''A'' list,
and Saturday night is the
loneliest night ofthe week for me.
- Oh. A Ferrari would
certainly change that.
- Perhaps. Mmm.
But, you know, this is the one.
Yes, yes, yes.
I saw three ofthese parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,
which tells me
only one thing.
There's too many self-indulgent
wieners in this city
with too much bloody money !
Now, ifI was driving...
a 1 967 275 GTB four-cam--
You would not be
a self-indulgent weiner, sir.
- You'd be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.
Champagne would fall
from the heavens.
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.
I don't have one here,
however I do have one
in the warehouse.
Superb.
What else doyou have
in the warehouse ?
Mm-hmm. Allright.
Uh-huh.
That was Mr. Lakewood
from the dealership.
He says thatboxer-lookingpunk
is gonnapick up thekeys...
to three new Mercedes today.
Same make and models
as the ones we already got impounded.
- Now we're talkin'.

We'll target all the cars

Fellas, this is Sway.
No questions.
I'm here for Kip.
- All right.
-Allright.
-
-
- It's me. He's here.
- The red Chevy Nova ?
- That's affi rmative, sir.
-
As soon as he leaves, you call me
with the owners' addresses, all right ?
I'll get those forms
right over, sir.
Damn boss.
Always on my case.
- I got three here ?
- Mm-hmm.
Thankyou.
Huh, Randall Raines,
DonnyAstricky, Otto Halliwell.
Should I set up
some tails ?
Uh-uh. They're
too smart for that.
They'll just
dump the cars.
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.
You go ahead and you
makeyour move, man.
And I will
be waiting foryou.
Why doyou call 'em
girls' names ?
That's a good question.
Why do you call 'em girls' names ?
It's code. YousayJane,
yousayShirley, Lucy, Edna,
and nobody listening
on the waves is the wiser.
Got 'em.
Okay.
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.
- There she is.
- Nice.
Damn, it's cold up here !
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated ?
And you know black people
don't like cold weather !
We're tropical people, man.
When this is over,
I'm gonna smoke ajoint,
watch two hours of Roots,
and I'm gonna kickyour ass.
