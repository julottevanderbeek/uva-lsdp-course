Spidey: Aunt May!
Phineas and Ferb are making a crossover.
Yeah, we are!
We're gonna zoom, zoom,
zoom through the stratosphere
There's a reason that they
call it the Final Frontier
Shoot the tube into the void
We're surfing asteroids
Take my hand
We're gonna rock and roll
Past a little red dwarf
and a big black hole
Pretty soon this
party's gonna supernova
Supernova
Supernova
Catch a big, blue
comet and a purple quasar
Just need a pressure suit
and a surf guitar
We're surfing asteroids
We're surfing those asteroids
We're surfing asteroids
We're surfing those asteroids
Yeah! The cosmic rays we collected
through our satellite dish
made a great power
source for our surfboards.
Baljeet: Well, I, for one, need
to get back to the space station.
- Phineas: All right.
- You know, these suits are equipped with...
Hi, guys!
How were the asteroid waves?
They were totally cranking, dude!
He called me "dude."
We're about the take the module
down. Are we cleared for landing?
All clear.
Hey, where is Perry?
CHORUS:  # Doofenshmirtz
Evil Incorporated! #
Struggle all you want, Perry the
Platypus. You're not getting out of that.
It's hydraulic. I don't
know if you're aware
of this, but my brother,
Roger, is the mayor.
All right, I may have touched
upon the subject from time to time,
but you know, I figured, why not
mention it again just for clarity?
Anyway, that job gives him
all these cool mayoral powers.
So, I created the
Power-drain-inator to drain all his
powers into this canister and then
I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz,
get to wield them!
Just think, I will have the power to
raise taxes, pass legislation, and even
cut the ceremonial ribbon at openings,
where I'll finally be able to use these!
You like them?
I got them at a garage sale.
Oh, see, that's one of those hydraulic
lines that, uh, goes to your...
Aw, come on. One kick
and you destroy my inator?
And what, you're just gonna thwart
and run? I, I thought this was going
to be a special, extended episode.
Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Whoa-oh!
- Hey, Vinnie. The usual?
- Yep. Same old same old.
Whoo! Ha!
I didn't know this was gonna be a pool
party. I would've brought my trunks.
Oh, hey, kid. Glad you could make it.
I'm just fashionably late.
Back off, fellas. If that
thing's firing anti-matter blasts,
- it's gonna pack a big punch.
- I pack a bigger punch.
Red Skull:
Modok, take zem all out.
Fool! Your webs can't
stop my mind.
Iron Man: That's it for you creeps.
Ooh! Ooh!
Can I web 'em up?
Let's go!
Move, you big tin schnitzel!
- What was that?
- I don't know, but they're getting away!
Whoa! Well, that's new.
Something's wrong I can't move.
Sit tight. Mighty Mjolnir
will bring them down.
- My strength, it's gone!
- I'll go.
Somehow, our powers have been drained.
I need to get to Jarvis and figure this out.
Let's get back to SHIELD.
Hey, guys!
My power's down and my suit's frozen.
Can somebody give me a hand?
- Hulk, can you carry him?
- My power's gone, too.
Oh, for... well, can somebody
find a furniture dolly?
That was the best thing
we've done this morning!
Mom! Hurry!
Here! Look!
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, kids.
- Why aren't you in space?
- Eh, we got hungry.
Oh, that's my cue.
I'll make you guys some
snacks before I leave.
Without my spider powers, I'm
just a guy in a body stocking.
And I had to leave
Mjolnir in the street!
It just became too heavy.
At least you guys aren't
locked inside this metal suit.
Man, do I regret having that
second cup of coffee this morning.
Now, we have to find out
where that beam came from.
Danville. Danville, USA.
Have you been standing
there this whole time?
Yes. Yes, I have.
The beam that hit you originated
from the Tri-State area,
bounced off a space
station's satellite dish,
and hit you in New York City
during your fight.
- Is that one of SHIELD's?
- No. It's theirs.
Man, that kid has a weird-shaped head.
Hey, guys, guys!
I can't see. Hey...
I got him.
Make sure you get all these
little pieces over here, too.
No, no, no.
You're missing the big one.
- Okey dokey!
- You know, Norm,
the Power-Drain-inator did get
one shot off before it died.
I wonder if it hit anything.
Male Newscaster:
Dateline, New York City.
A mysterious ray has drained the power
from four of our beloved superheroes.
We now return you to Horse in
a Bookcase, already in progress.
That was me! That was me!
I drained the power
from those superheroes!
Winning! Ooh! Ooh!
I-I should update my evil
blog on the Love Muffin site!
"OMG. I drained all
the powers from a group
of superheroes all the way in New York,
and those powers belong
to me now! Happy emoticon."
And, send.
Norm, let's get the powers out of the
canister so I can start wielding them.
I can't wait to fly and run fast and
carry a big hammer around for no reason!
Uh, sir, I hate to be the bearer of empty
canisters, but this canister is empty.
What?
So I don't have the powers?
Time to blog a retraction, I guess!
Uh, you know, I'm not gonna change it.
Uh, everyone exaggerates
on the Internet.
Red Skull: There was a
slight miscalculation.
Becomes clearer upon seeing zis footage.
That makes it more than a
slight miscalculation, Red Skull.
It is a major mistake!
We could have destroyed
the heroes once and for all.
Enough! It doesn't change the fact
that the heroes are now powerless.
But what could have
happened to their powers?
Modok?!
I, Modok, the perfect combination
of human intellect and machine,
have interfaced with all
of the digital information
stored on the vast network
of the World Wide Web!
Yeah, I can do the same thing with
my phone. Plus, I've got free roaming.
- Nice!
- As I was saying, I have found some puny,
inferior human known as
Doofenshmirtz claiming that
he has drained the heroes
of all their superpowers.
Hmm, Doofenshmirtz.
That sounds Drusselsteinian.
I have a cousin who married
a Drusselsteinian. She is dead to me!
- So, who is this Doofenshmirtz?
- I'm projecting his image now.
- Red Skull: He is beautifully grotesque.
- All hideous and deformed.
- He must have some backstory.
- Where can we find ziss sideshow freak?
He is in the Tri-State area.
Danville, to be precise.
Danville, eh? Gentlemen, it looks
like we are going on an evil road trip.
- Ooh, shotgun.
- You do not fit in ze shotgun position!
Well, that was fun. And it's only 10:30.
- What else should we do today?
- Oh, hey, kids.
I'm going to be taking a walking
tour of the Tri-State area today.
Yes, Candace. You're in charge.
- Whoopie!
- Bye, kids!
Hey, where's Perry?
Oh, there he is!
Ah, Perry the Platyp...
You're not Perry the Platypus!
Who are you guys?
This is Whiplash, this is
Venom, and I am Red Skull.
Yes. Yes, you are. You know,
you really should use sun block.
Y-You're burned down to the bone.
I am Modok and you are the
one they call Doofenshmirtz.
Oh, yeah, that's what they sing at
the end of the birthday song an...
Oh, you know, at least they
would have...
if anybody ever sang
that song for me. Anyway.
Hey, the floating head and little
arms thing. I tried that back in the '90s.
I'll rule the Tri-State area!
Aah!
I cou... I could never
maneuver out the front door,
but I see you're pretty mobile.
What are you guys doing here?
Show us your devices, Doofenshmirtz.
"Sure-so devices"?
Is that Latin?
- Show us your devices.
- I'm still not getting it. Uh, anyone?
- I have no idea.
- Show. Us. Your. Devices.
Oh, you want to see my inators!
Man, man, you got quite an accent there.
All right, here's what
I'm working on now.
Behold! The Sloth-inator. It will
give me the powers of a sloth!
Which are super slowness
and super leaf-eating.
- Are you sure this is the right guy?
- Modok is infallible!
Then he must be toying with
us, playing us for fools.
He is even more
diabolical than we thought.
Seriously, I'll be able
to eat this whole branch!
But, you know, like, slowly.
Ferb, are you expecting someone?
Not them.
Spider-Man: Aren't you a little young
to be stealing superheroes' super powers?
Yes. Yes, we would be,
Spider-Man, if we actually did it.
But like I said, I don't think we did.
You can't see it, but I have a rather
severe look of disappointment on my face.
This'll turn that tin frown upside down.
Juice in a box. We have
nothing like this in Asgard!
- Straw cannot penetrate!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Calm, blue ocean. Let me take
care of that for you, buddy.
Thanks, Isabella.
Well, the power siphoning ray
originated in the Tri-State area.
And I was thinking you guys
would know something about it
since it bounced off your space station.
- Are you sure it was our space station?
- It was shaped like your head.
Well, that sounds like ours, but we don't
know anything about a power siphoning ray.
I was afraid of that. Well, the first
thing we have to do is get our powers back.
- Ferb, I know what we're gonna...
- All right, boys and girls, listen up!
Mom's on a walking tour of
Danville, and Dad's tinkering in
the basement, so I'm in charge.
That means no shenanigans.
Hey, Spider-Man. So I'll be
over at Stacy's all d-d-d-d-day.
- Sup?
- Greetings, fair young maiden.
It's superheroes in our kitchen!
Candace is gonna go lie down
for a while.
- That's it, just breathe.
- Thor... Hulk... Iron Man... in our kitchen...
- Isabella: They're only superheroes.
- Looks like you guys have a fan.
Oh, boy.
Then it's probably good
she didn't see that.
Hey, where's Perry?
Due to the gravity of your mission
today, the gentleman on the big screen
will be addressing you while I
use this old TV monitor Carl found
- in the basement.
- Carl: Sorry, sir.
Anyway, this is Director
Nick Fury of S-H-I-E-L-D.
That's SHIELD.
It's an acronym.
Yes, except it's cool.
Now, where is your agent, Major?
- He's sitting right there.
- You mean, behind the platypus?
No, that's secret agent
Perry the Platypus.
Is he some kind of super platypus
with super platypus powers?
Does he have some kind of
robotic platypus exoskeleton?
- He, uh... he has a fedora.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Were you wearing
that eye patch when we started?
Oh, this? Yeah, it's, uh,
doctor's orders. Uh, I have a sty.
- Carl: He thinks it makes him look cool!
- No, I don't!
I'm going to proceed as if
this were going really well.
Agent P, Iron Man, Thor,
Hulk and Spider-Man have lost
their super powers due to a
mysterious power siphoning ray,
which we believe originated
somewhere in the Danville area.
We fear a group of
super-villains are closing in.
We need you to monitor the
situation and report back.
Francis, I'm gonna need you...
Now what are you doing?
Carl: He thinks two eye patches
makes him look twice as cool.
Welcome to my hall of inators.
Ah, here's a good one.
This, this was my
Oatmeal-to-porridge-inator.
I know, it's a fine distinction,
don't get me started.
And here's my Multi-helio-
tactical-baboon-glom-inator.
I think that one is self-explanatory.
Oh and here's my Waffle-inator,
and the Junk-mail-inator...
I do not understand.
These machines are useless.
- What is wrong with this man?
- Maybe he is a misunderstood genius.
Or maybe he is a
perfectly understood idiot.
And finally, my Disintegrator-inator!
Pretty impressive, huh?
Where is the machine zat took
away the powers of the heroes?
Oh, my Power-drain-inator!
Ooh, that was a cool one.
And it was destroyed by my nemesis,
Perry the Platypus. You just missed him.
Perry the Platypus?
Is he a Super-Soldier platypus?
- No.
- Was he bitten by a radioactive platypus?
No, he's, uh, just a regular,
crime-fighting platypus.
It is no matter!
You will rebuild the machine!
Oh, so we're working
together now! Great!
I'll be the leader. I've
always wanted an evil entourage.
- Let's destroy him.
- Nein. Let him think he is in charge.
When he has exceeded his usefulness,
we will give him to Modok to destroy.
Hey, where is Modok?
Curse you, Danville,
town of small doors!
Listen, before I rebuild the machine,
I've got some errands to run.
You guys should come with.
Is your head gonna burst into flames,
or am I thinking of somebody else?
Ladies and gentlemen, and
Hulk, allow me to unveil our
Secret Hideout for Emergency Defense,
or "SHED" for short.
I think we're gonna need
something a little bigger.
Oh, the rustic exterior is a facade.
Wait till you see the inside!
Iron Man: Oh, man!
You guys are good.
Just a little British sci-fi technology.
Iron Man, looks like
someone raided your armory.
Oh, you like that, huh?
This is the Beak suit, Mark 2.
We're still working on the waterproofing,
so we can't take it out in the rain.
You know, Stark Industries
offers summer internships.
Thanks, but this
summer is pretty packed.
- Apparently.
- And these are your SHED key card IDs.
They'll get you into all
areas of the compound.
Ooh! And they're laminated.
Um... hi.
Would you guys read my fan fiction?
It's a story where Thor and Hulk
decide to learn ice-skating...
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to accept unsolicited material.
Candace, I didn't know
you were a fangirl.
Oh, sure, from way back. It started
'cause I had to do a lot of research to
get up to speed for the Ducky
Momo-Superhero crossover event.
Quack-quack!
Ducky Momo-san, superhero-desu!
Okay, superheroes,
we have to get to work
building a device that
will restore your powers!
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.
Nobody's gonna tell
us what we can't do
My evil buddies and me
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop
Me and my evil friends
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop, doop, doop
We're a roving pack of
ne'er-do-wells, you see
My evil buddies and me
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop, doop, dooby-doop
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop, doop, dooby-doop
My evil buddies and me
If you see us out carousing,
you better stay in your garage
We're the jerks who stole
all those wieners from that guy
My evil buddies and I
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop, doop, dooby-doop
Shoop, dooby-doop, doop
My evil buddies and I
Until we find out what
happened to your actual powers,
this machine should be able
to replicate them temporarily.
Everyone in position, and
we'll start calibration.
- Let's get our hero on!
- Just a minute, Candace. We all set?
- All set. Just as soon as I...
- Great! All set!
lock down the power assignments
and reverse polarity.
- Candace, what did you do?
- Uh-oh.
- Are you guys okay?
- By Odin's beard, I feel invigorated!
- See? It worked. Hmm?
- Well, not exactly. Look!
Something is not right.
Whew! Oh, boy!
That was great!
Hey, I've got an idea! Let's go get
some ice cream and spoil our dinner.
I mean, who's gonna tell us no, huh?
That's it! I've had it!
We are wasting our time!
We need to bring the heroes to us!
Well!
Something's gone
terribly wrong, Candace.
You've swapped all their powers.
Obviously, Thor's got Spider-Man's powers!
Spider-Man got Hulk's powers.
Yeah, I could get used to this.
I... I have a fear of heights.
Could you please put us down?
- Iron Man must have Thor's powers.
- Well, at least he can move now.
Everyone has new super powers,
except Hulk. He must have
Iron Man's powers, but without the
suit, there's not much there.
- I am feeling entrepreneurial.
- At least his vocabulary's improved.
So give me the hammer. What do I do?
Just stick out my hand, right?
Come on, baby, come to papa.
That's not how it works.
What do you mean?
I've got your powers.
Wielding Mjolnir is about
worthiness, not power.
- Really?
- It's a fine distinction,
- but an important one.
- Potayto, potahto.
- I do not know what that means.
- Okay, never mind.
What about the lightning?
How do I control that?
Actually, that only
works with the hammer.
What about flying? I've seen you fly.
Well, yes.
But not without the hammer.
Not without the hammer. Right.
- This is a disaster, Candace.
- Look, it was an accident,
but I can still help.
I know that the villains will...
The entire Tri-State area, and
possibly the world, is at stake here.
Honestly, Candace, if you
don't know what you're doing,
keep your hands off the machinery!
- Well, then, maybe I should just leave.
- Yeah, maybe you should.
Male Newscaster: Alert! Alert!
Relevant news broadcast intercepted!
Horse in a Bookcase is canceled
after a nineteen-year run.
An evil entourage of three super villains,
and what appears to be a pharmacist
and a giant chicken egg with a face, are
busting up the place something fierce.
- We are needed.
- But you can't!
Your powers, they're not fixed yet.
We just need more time.
I know, Phineas. But we're heroes.
This is what we do.
- Wait! Can we help?
- Not unless you can fly.
Well, it's not raining.
This should get their attention.
Spider-Man: Looks like
somebody left the door open!
All right, gang, it's
show time! Everybody ready?
- I feel pretty good!
- I'd feel better with a metal suit.
- Sorry, big guy. No time.
- Look!
Ah, the superheroes are here to save
the day. But without your powers,
this is just a costume party.
Modok, destroy them!
Yes, I will take great pleasure
in destroying these puny heroes.
I got him, guys.
Spider-Man smash!
Male tour guide:
Looking to your left, you'll see...
Whoa!
- Was he making fun of me?
- A little, yes.
Whiplash: They still have their powers!
Yes, but they are all mixed up.
Is this your doing?
I don't remember making
a Power-switch-inator,
but you know, I make a lot
of inators, so... Aah!
You know, it'd really be nice right
now to have the power to throw a hammer.
I told you, it's not about
power, it's about worthiness.
It's like talking to a Bilgesnipe.
Hey, what's going on...
Get off my... I find myself
in a sticky situation.
Oh, no, I've received
Spider-Man's propensity for puns.
Now I wish we'd prioritized
the waterproofing.
Now I'm Iron Man!
Okay, that time I overshot the mark.
Oh, hey, Venom, what'd I miss?
- Spider Man, are you okay?
- Could be worse.
At least Iron Man and Thor are...
Well, at least Iron Man...
Sorry, gang. A little
tied up at the moment.
Okay, never mind.
It couldn't be worse.
Stan Lee:  Welcome
back, faithful viewers.
their fate hung in the balance
in a cataclysmic cliffhanger.
This was all too easy.
The time for heroes is over.
Now all will bow to us, for
nothing will save you now!
Stop him!
Hey, duck guy, thanks for
the rescue. Do we tip him?
- He's not parking our car.
- I just don't know the etiquette.
Ugh!
Who was that masked beaver duck?
Modok will exterminate all beaver ducks!
You know, none of this
would've happened if we
had just gone for ice
cream like I suggested.
Thank you, small but mighty friend.
- You know, he seemed vaguely familiar.
- You think that was Howard the Duck?
Time is of the essence. We've got...
no, it wasn't Howard the Duck!
- What? I'm just sayin'.
- He did have a bill.
Anyway, we need to regroup
and figure out a plan B.
Right.
Back to SHED-quarters!
- Hi, guys.
- So, how'd it go?
Iron Man: We got our butts handed to us.
How was Venom able to overpower
you when you have Hulk's strength?
I don't know, I'm...
I'm not feeling it anymore.
Wait, let me try something.
- I did not stick.
- I was afraid of that.
The powers are not bonding
with your cell structures.
Yes, my suit is getting heavier again.
But at least having Thor's strength
unlocked the joints, so I can move.
Perhaps we can give you a recharge,
but of course, this time with
the correct powers. We have been
working on rebuilding the machine.
And I'm helping!
- You are?
- I'm redeeming myself!
Yes, and we are almost done
with the first component.
Hulk's gamma ray concentration
beam. Brawn first, right, big guy?
- That's great!
- So, have you done
- a base level particle acceleration yet?
- Baljeet: I was just about to.
Iron Man: It's really
important to make sure you...
- Wait. Let me get this for you.
- Phineas: Oh, sure.
Otherwise, the gamma
ray inverters... Whoa!
- Uh, who plugged...
- Uh-oh.
Baljeet smash!
Wow. There's something you
don't see every... what?
Really, Candace? Do you have
any idea what you just did?
I was just trying to help.
Well, your help this morning
messed us up so badly,
we came this close to
being wiped out at the mall.
I thought you would've
learned your lesson.
- But... But I...
- But no. You show up again to help,
and now Baljeet has been Hulkified
and is rampaging who knows where.
And we're back to square one
with restoring the heroes' powers.
- But... but....
- This is just too important...
And we can't afford any more setbacks!
I'm revoking your SHED card.
You have to go. Now.
I've always told her, don't
ever make Phineas angry.
You wouldn't like it when he's angry.
Oh, no! Baljeet!
We've gotta go after him!
Sadly, there is no time.
Our mission lies elsewhere.
- Well, I'll go after him, then.
- No, no. I'll go.
You stay here, little girl.
It might get ugly.
What, you don't think I can handle ugly?
I've been hanging out
with you all summer.
Nick Fury: Greetings Agent P.
SHIELD has gotten intel that
the super villains are
holed up in downtown Danville
in an oddly shaped building
with its own jingle.
We need you to find
out what they're up to.
And neutralize them
if possible, Agent P.
Monogram! Seriously?
The beard, too?
You're not the only one who can
rock an awesome face mullet, Fury!
And see, it takes four orbs of
mundanium finite to power it,
and it would only take one orb of pizzazzium
infinionite, but that's so hard to find.
Oh, don't get me started. So, we just
lock the module in here and viola!
Yeah, I know, it's a large violin. I...
I don't know why people say that.
Anyhoo, what did you guys need
a second Power-drain-inator for?
So we won't have to deal
with your idiocy anymore!
Wait, that's not nice!
I thought we were buds!
We were amigos! We had...
we had a song and everything!
Your little musical interlude
was a pleasant diversion at best.
You see, we're not going to
take over the Tri-State area.
We are going to completely destroy it
to show what will happen if
anyone attempts to thwart our plan.
Did you just say, " 'Swart' our plan" ?
No. "Thwart."
"Thwart" with a "T-H." "Thwart."
Yeah, I'm thinking
maybe you should go see
a speech pathologist or
a dialect coach or something.
Silence! Once we have made our point,
we will use our contraption to draw away
ze powers of all ze superheroes on
ze planet and take over ze world!
Wow, you guys really think big!
But first, Venom, squash
our little fly on ze ceiling.
Now we go and send a little message to
our handicapped heroes.
- Come! Schnell!
- You're not very good at thwarting.
I... I should hook you up with
my nemesis, Perry the Platypus,
for some pointers.
It's an art form for him.
Baljeet smash!
Tour Guide: The courtyard also
features a statue of Franz the Elephant.
- Hey, Candace. Whatcha doin'?
- Just laying here, utterly dejected.
I hear you. None of the women
superheroes showed up, so it's
all about testosterone and
powers and fighting. Which... Eh.
I was only trying to help, but all I
did was mess things up. I'm useless.
I know exactly how you feel.
BOTH:  # I'm not trying
to place the blame #
That we could be,
yes, we should be
Though I'm acting
nonchalant, it's clear
Only tryin' to help
Only tryin' to help
Only tryin' to help
Only tryin' to help now
Only tryin' to help now
Only tryin' to help
Tryin' to help, Phineas.
Oh, hello, girls. Don't
mind me, just trying
to give the lawn a bit
of a drink. It's off now.
Hey, Baljeet.
I'm so happy that I found you.
I worry about you, you know.
Because you're my best friend.
Oh. Thanks, Buford. I did not
like being an angry monster.
I'm glad, because you weren't
very good at it anyway.
Really? I think I was
actually quite terrifying.
Oh, come on. You're totally
green. No pun intended.
For example, when you grab
somebody's shirt to lift them up...
- Hey!
- ...you gotta twist it first.
And then you yell really loud!
Do not yell at Baljeet like that!
Okay, the throwing was good.
But when you grabbed my
shirt, you didn't twist!
I swear, it's like in one
ear and right out the other.
Oh, oh, Baljeet, wait up!
Citizens of Danville and the
surrounding Tri-State area,
Unless Iron Man, Spider-Man,
Thor and Hulk show up to face us,
we will unleash a device a thousand
times worse than the one that hit them.
Thanks to Modok's modifications,
our Power-drain-inator
it drains energy, matter,
everything the target was. Observe.
Aw, man! And I just moved here from New
York 'cause I thought it would be safer.
Uh, guys, you'd better come see this.
So, heroes, either you
come down here and face us,
or we will unleash this weapon
on the entire Tri-State area!
Ugh! The fiend!
I actually missed a lot of that with
the accent. But I got that it's bad.
- Oh, man. What are we gonna do?
- What we have to.
- But you have no powers!
- That doesn't matter.
We've gotta fight back with
whatever we've got left.
Being a hero isn't the armor you
wear, but the mettle in your spirit
- and the steel in your resolve.
- Man, that was eloquent.
All I ever do is quips.
Like this one, for instance.
Iron Man: Can we please not
kill the gravitas of this moment?
Man! We've got a lot to do if we're
gonna get this suit back online.
I think we can get sixty
percent function back if we
reroute the power flow
through the backup circuits.
Maybe if I just go in and apologize
one more time, they'll forgive me.
I have a stomach ache, I feel so bad.
They're your brothers, they'll listen.
Phineas, look, I'm sorry.
How did you get in? I thought
I revoked your SHED ID.
- Well, Isabella gave me her guest pass.
- Fine. But don't touch anything.
- Ferb, you gotta listen to me!
- The shoulder joint's ready.
- Excuse me, Candace.
- Phineas, can't you stop and listen?
Candace, you don't understand!
The guys are in trouble.
If we can't get downtown to help
them, this may be their final battle.
- Whiplash: The heroes are not coming.
- Oh, don't worry, they'll come.
My sensors tell me the
heroes are approaching.
Perfect! Surround ze bus!
Out of my way, you weirdoes!
It's worse than Portland.
Hey, Modok, can you feel it in
your brain when I go like this?
- We have zem now.
- What about the old lady?
No, she is not... she's not with zem!
Don't you have some sort
of power to get out of this?
Hey... oh, wow, you've
got super wire cutters?
What, were they nail clippers that got
bitten by radioactive pinking shears?
We've only got half the servo
motors on the right side online.
This isn't funny, guys,
you can't go. It's not safe!
- Phineas!
- Don't worry, Isabella.
Initiate launching sequence, Ferb.
- Phineas, you've only got one butt jet.
- Well, that'll have to do.
Phineas!
Pathetic! Look at how
you've wasted your lives,
protecting these humans
who are so quick to abandon
you in your hour of need.
- Whiplash!
- What?
- I was talking to him!
- Sorry.
Now that you have no powers,
you have no friends, no allies.
- We have a Baljeet.
- Hulkjeet.
Oh my bad. Apparently he
prefers to be known as Hulkjeet.
Iron Man: And this thing.
I think it's a bird, it's with us, too.
Iron Man: The Flying Duck
with a beaver tail. We got him.
But I've got to level with ya.
I have no idea who's shooting waffles.
Woo-hoo! Top of the world, Ma!
Yo, Red!
Is this doo-hickey important?
- The mundanium finite reactor core!
-  I guess it is important.
Go get him! I shall guard
the inator...
- Thanks, Baljeet.
- Hulkjeet!
There's one thing I don't understand
about the lost superpowers.
In all the comics I've read,
energy can never be destroyed.
Only morphed into a different
form or contained somehow.
Candace! When we were
up at the space station,
we were collecting and containing data.
- You were up in what?
- Come on!
- Have a seat.
- What are you talking about?
- Just go with it.
- Oh, that's where this thing was!
- Yeah, I souped it up.
- Here, hold this.
Go get him, boy.
Good dog!
Beware Bear Boy!
Oh, you kids stay back.
Candace: You don't think it's weird
the space station looks like Phineas?
- Isabella: If by weird, you mean dreamy.
- Candace: Oh, brother.
Look! The collection tank!
There's something glowing in there.
- It's got to be the powers!
- Looks like the fight's begun!
Now, make the powers blast
out down there and stuff.
- I don't know how to do that.
- What do you mean?
- Didn't Phineas explain how to...
- Yeah, it was like,
"Isabella, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah."
"Isabella, wah, wah, wah."
He was dressed like an astronaut.
I was distracted!
Ze mundanium finite!
Get zose orbs!
Ooh, these waffles aren't enough! I...
I wish I could just
disintegrate them all...
Oh, right. The
Disintegrator-inator! Duh!
I don't know what I was...
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
Hmm...
Oh, here's the problem.
Okay, I just need an
extension cord this long.
Isabella, I think this is the button
that will release the superpowers.
- How can you tell?
- Well, it's red, see?
And there's some red detailing on that
collector thing, so it's gotta be it.
That's a very irrational
and reckless deduction.
No, Isabella! I've failed twice
already, so third time's a charm!
COMPUTER OVER P.A.:
System shutting down.
Uh-oh.
- Candace!
- Orbit decaying.
We're falling back to Earth!
Fuel systems immobilized.
Social network friends de-friending.
Okay, this long.
This long. Let's see.
Too short, too short, too long,
way too short!
Why would I even have this?
Tour Guide:  If you look to
your left, you will see the J.P. McHenry
Building built in the
Art Deco style. And on your right
is Danville's oldest
arcade built in 1982.
Talk about being disarmed.
That's not good.
Hey! Over here!
Enough of ziss foolishness!
And now, behold ze destruction
of ze entire Tri-State...
Phineas: Hey, Ferb.
Is that our space station?
Yo, heroes!
Got a little something for ya!
Candace! The data
collection tank. Of course!
Great job! Somebody's
using their spider sense.
I learned from the best, Spidey!
Get up!
Get zem, you fools!
Super, super
You know I'm feeling super, super
Hmm...
I'm always feeling super, super
You gonna take a step back
I'm feeling super, super
Oh, for crying out loud!
# I run so fast
I got a speeding ticket #
I think perhaps our window
of opportunity has closed.
Well, Iron Man, it looks like
you're functioning at full capacity.
Yeah, why don't you kids
take five and enjoy the show?
- Oh, this is going to be sweet.
- Yeah, it is!
Better?
What are you looking at?
You think you're kinda bad
I know you're thinking that
you wanna try and knock me down
Got something heavy
Swing it
You think you got a hand
You better play it
But don't be surprised
if you pull back a stump
That chip on your shoulder
I think you better weigh it
Hey, Hulk!
That's using my head.
- Nice!
- Word play.
You think you got the stuff
You think you're tough enough
Then just roll up a cuff and
come and try and knock me down
You think you wanna dance
Come on and take a chance   Thor!
Not worth a second glance
You wanna try to knock me down
So just say you're all in
and let the chips fall
And then we can find
out who's the real chump
If you think I'm gonna fold
Then you could win it all
Hey...
- Hey.
- So...
Earlier, I really lost it.
Uh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I deserved it.
Everything I did made things worse.
It's okay, you were trying to help.
And, hello!
You guys saved the day!
- Thanks.
- So...
Will you take your SHED
membership card back?
- I fixed it.
- I accept.
If you're feeling froggy just jump
If you're feeling
froggy just jump, come on
What?
Is that Mom?
You know I love you guys,
and I'm super glad we made up,
but would you look at this place?
Sorry, but you are so busted!
Mom!
Toss 'em in. Nice work, kids.
You didn't just get
back our heroes' powers,
you showed true courage
fighting alongside them.
SHIELD owes you a debt of gratitude.
Yeah!
Hot dogs for everyone, baby!
Tour Guide: Three years
later when the new day care
center was built on top of
the ancient burial ground...
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom!
You gotta come back to the square!
The boys' space satellite
crashed down to Earth, and
these villains had a machine
to destroy the Tri-State area.
And there's superheroes!
All in the square!
- You gotta see it!
- I'm surprised that's not on the tour...
No time for sarcasm, Mom.
Come on!
Here's my direct line, Ferb.
Internship, next summer. It'll be fun.
Next time, Phin, the
juice box will be my treat.
You got it, Spidey!
Uh, okay.
Ow!
Ha-ha!
Gotcha.
Finally found an extension
cord the right size.
Take that, bad guys!
Candace: Mom, there's a giant head
shaped like Phineas. And superheroes!
- But... but... but...
- Oh, yes, there they are.
- Wha...
- Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, all of them.
I forgot you had a
thing for comic books.
But... but this isn't how...
Wait, where did...
You wanna join me for
the rest of the tour?
No, I'd rather stay here and sulk.
I did it! Did anyone see that?
Anyone? Anyone?
No one's looking.
Nobody's paying attention.
Hey!
There goes that unknown superhero!
You were pretty awesome out there.
Yeah, and what's your secret identity?
Buford, a hero never reveals
their secret identity.
Sure they do. Watch.
- Group: Ducky Momo?
- Ducky Momo?
That's strange. I was convinced that
he was an anthropomorphic platypus.
What with the
beaver tail and all.
Oh, there you are, Perry.
You missed all the fun.
