MAN: Sniper team in position.
WOMAN: Go, go!
MAN:  Go! Police!
MAN: Finish him.
MAN: Finish him.
What happened, Chi-Tak?
You let me down.
Come on, D.
Let me explain.
Next time, I promise I'll do...
You're not a warrior,
you're a rat.
Find me another contestant.
Listen to me.

Start your day right...
the right way. The right...
Tai chi, that's different.
Innocent.
- What do you think, boss?
- Start the content.
We have a contender.
RADIO HOST: Stuck in traffic
and late for work?
Here's a new song
to make you feel better.
- Better.
- new age, 98.6...
- Better.
They say it's just underground
fighting, but it's not.
There's something else
going on.
- You gotta get me out.
- I'll get you out. I promise.
Where are we going?
WOMAN:
Please stand facing the mirror
before the white line.
Tiger Chen.
Congratulations.
Please.
- How do you feel?
- Good.
Good.
- Was that tai chi?
- Yes.
- Really? What style?
- My own.
How would you like to test
how good you are, Tiger?
Or could become?
No referees, no rules.
Pure fighting, man to man.
Would do you mean?
What's the job?
- You fight and get paid.
- I fight and get paid?
What about the
security position?
This pays better.
I can't fight tai chi for money.
It's dishonorable.
You must have responsibilities.
A master? Parents?
Fight for them.
- What if I lose?
- You're fired.
Call me.
Enjoy your flight home.
TIGER: Mr. Donaka Mark.
- Tiger.
- I'm interested.
- So am I.
This is how it works.
WOMAN:
- and state your name.
- Tiger Chen.
Come on, let's fight!
Come on!
Come on!
WOMAN:  Fight!
Damn, that guy's a beast.
He likes it.
DONAKA: Fantastic.
- What?
Yes?
Hey, Tiger! I'm Gong.
Man, I need to shake your hand.
Who are they?
What are they doing?
What, those?
For your fans.
What do you mean, my fans?
People watch?
The world over, Tiger.
They love it. They love you.
No, no one ever said anything
about showing the fights.
Hey, don't worry about it, man.
It don't get screened
in China, just overseas,
to a very select few group.
I thought this was private.
I thought...
It is. Don't
worry about it.
Look, it's like
pay-per-view.
People pay to see the fight,
that simple.
And right now, T-man,
you are the star!
- Were they always watching?
- Does it matter?
Is that what you fought for?
Yes.
Is that why you won?
No.
- Why'd you win?
- Because I'm better.
What's the number?
Good, they like him.
This is Gong, live from
Beijing Championship Hall,
signing off from another
fantastic fight,
where our T-man, man of tai chi,
was once again outrageous.
He has it in him.
"Fish taste pork"?
With rice, too?
Damn, I'm hungry right now, man.
DONAKA:
- No.
- Tomorrow night.
- What time?
- Six p.m.
What's going on?
Where's the fight?
Does it matter?
What's going on?
Who are all those people?
Your fans.
Get yourself ready.
Here I am tonight
with my man Tiger Chen,
just before the fight.
What you got to say, Tiger?
Tell our audience how you feel.
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- All right, he's ready!
Good evening.
It is my honor to introduce
to you Tiger Chen...
...and his opponents Zian...
...and Zihou.
A fine line separates
a fighter from a warrior.
One is motivated by reason,
the other by purpose.
Tonight, we witness
this distinction
as our contestants battle to
prove who and what they are.
Fight.
He's getting killed
out there, boss.
I thought you wanted
him to go all the way.
He has to learn.
What's the matter?
You afraid of what
you can do to them?
Don't be.
Bring up camera six.
GONG: Our hero, Tiger Chen,
fighting today.
A knockout artist,
a punisher. The crane.
Will Tiger survive?
Boss, this guy's a killer.
CHI-TAK:
He says it's just underground
fighting, but it's not.
There's something else going on.
Get me a fight.
A fight you will get.
Tonight is about
more than fighting.
- Who am I facing?
- A mercenary.
- What's his specialty?
- Killing.
Get yourself ready.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Tonight we bear witness
to the purity of purpose
and the absence of reason.
Two warriors, one destination.
Who will claim it as their own:
Tiger Chen...
...or Uri Romanov?
- Fight!
Finish him.
Finish him.
What did you kill him?
Don't kid yourself.
I just finished
what you started.
I didn't come here to kill.
Then why did you come here?
For the money?
I don't want to
do this anymore.
What? You think this
is a delivery job?
You think
you can just quit?
- What do you mean?
I'll see you in three days.
Yes, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Let's go.
DONAKA: You on your way?
- Yes.
Sure thing, boss.
So chill right inside. I'll be back
when they're ready for you, all right?
Is she dead?
Yes.
- Enjoy.
- I will.
MALE ANNOUNCER: From the mists
of ancient times,
Not traditionally thought of
as a martial art, until now.
In the heart of China,
an only son,
and the last student of Ling
Kong Tai Chi, began his quest.
He wanted to be the best,
and we gave him that chance.
I can't fight tai chi for
money. It's dishonorable.
ANNOUNCER: What would he fight
for? We gave him a reason:
ANNOUNCER: - We had him.
- Fight!
ANNOUNCER:
We pit him against other
styles to evolve his own.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Chen Lin Hu's
punch strikes at 23 miles per hour
with an impact of 900
pounds per square inch.
MALE ANNOUNCER: He saved
the temple. Decision.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: He could walk away,
he could go back to his life, his job,
his master,
his temple, his honor.

MALE ANNOUNCER: Tiger Chen,
Man of Tai Chi.
- How did you like it?
Ah!
- Oh!
Anybody can
watch a fight, Tiger.
But to watch a person's
life evolve and change,
that is what I offer.
This was never
about the fighting.
This was about you.
Your life.
Why? Why me?
Because we want to see
the loss of innocence.
We want to see a pure-hearted,
good-natured man of tai chi
- become a killer.
- No.
Yes.
Kill or be killed, Tiger.
That's what they want.
That's what I want.
Let the show begin.
Good evening, and thank you for joining
us tonight for a special event:
a fight to the death.

I won't...
I'll fight you.
I'll fight you!

I won't fight you.

You owe me a life.

calm and stay where you are.
Do not move until given
clear instructions.

You owe me a life.
I knew you had it in you.
