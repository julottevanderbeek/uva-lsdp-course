Uh, "Take It To The Limit"?
Artist and year?
Very funny.
RICHARD HARRIS'
RICHARD HARRIS'
That's not a song.
It's ridiculous.
You made it up.
That is definitely a song.
It's a good song, and a winning song.
You give up?
On belay.
"MacArthur Park."
Richard Harris. 1 968.
I didn't even think they had
recorded music back then.
Excuse me. I have a signed album
by Mr. Harris.
It was cutting-edge stuff back then.
Ah.
Peter, check your sister's belay.
Want to tell him
we're not 1 5 anymore?
Why bother?
We'll always be 1 5.
Dad, she needs a second cam.
That won't hold in a fall.
Screw you.
Listen, Annie.
No matter how experienced,
a smart climber always
wears a belt
and suspenders.
Dad--
Two cams are safe, three's better.
I'm not kidding. We're not moving
until you put another cam in the wall.
I have three cams.
He's yanking your chain.
MAN:
Watch out!
Amateurs at 1 2 o'clock!
Check your safety!
MAN:
Ah !
Ah !
Too much weight!
It's not gonna hold !
ROYCE:
Hold it together,
you two!
Now get a grip.
We're getting out
of this.
Annie, how close
to the wall are we?
Argh !
Keep still, goddamn it!
Stop moving around ! Stop!
Dad !
ROYCE:
Both of you. . .
keep very still.
Try and stay calm.
Annie.
Is the other cam moving?
No.
Try and reach the wall.
See if you can anchor us back in.
Try it.
It's moving !
Peter, get your knife.
What?
Just do as I say.
Get it!
You don't have much time here.
You have to do something for me.
Cut me loose.
No, no, no.
There's too much weight here.
One cam is never gonna hold us
I can get us in.
You have to cut me loose
or else I'll pull everybody down.
I'm not gonna do it.
Everybody will die!
It'll hold.
Shut up, Annie!
It'll hold !
It's one dead or three, Peter.
Don't make him do this.
You're gonna kill
your sister.
Annie will die
if you don't.
Cut the rope!
No, I won't do it!
Cut the rope!
PETER: I can't!
Stop it!
That cam is gonna
come out and Annie
and you will die!
You'll kill your sister!
Don't listen ! Stop it!
Cut the damn rope! Cut it!
It doesn't matter
about me! Cut it!
We're out of time!
Don't do it!
No one will blame
you for it!
Just cut it, Peter!
We're gonna die!
Annie and you
are gonna die!
Just cut it, Peter!
Ugh !
Ah !
We're cleared
for the Siachen glacier.
A doctor's on standby.
I was heading there anyway.
Mail and supplies.
I can drop you on
my way back
to K2 base camp.
Sounds good.
I tried to visit you a few days ago.
But the weather closed in.
Annie's at base camp.
Arrived last week.
Would you like a tea?
No, I'm fine.
You must try the tea.
It's very good.
Indian, of course.
We may be at war
with them, but there's
no point in overreacting,
their tea's the best.
AssaIam aIaikum, sir.
Forgive me. Mr. Garrett, isn't it?
Yes.
NationaI Geographic
is always welcome.
They the only Westerners who
ever come to Pakistan without
wanting to conquer something.
The colonel's angry.
Only 25% of his medical
supplies are onboard.
And three days late.
Look at this place.
In six years,
I've lost 800 men.
Not one to the enemy.
I don't understand.
The chopper was full of stuff.
Not for my men.
For wealthy Americans who can
pay two or $3 million for
climbing permits.
Elliot Vaughn, the entrepreneur.
He's got 40 people
with him to try K2.
I've been seconded to his team.
Seconded or sold?
That's a question only a general
in Islamabad can answer.
Three o'clock.
Time to wake up the Indians.
So I take it Annie's coming
in with Vaughn's team?
She's leading a WNN
documentary crew.
They're going
up the mountain
with him.
Have you seen her?
Not yet. One of the guides told me.
What about Vaughn?
What's he all about?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Sensitive, kind, modest.
You know,
your typical billionaire.
Four years ago he was part of
an American team that took
on the south face.
Was 800 feet from the top
when weather closed in.
Twenty-four hours
in the death zone.
Next morning, he walked down.
I don't care what anybody says,
He's a bloody good climber.
Got your update, Annie.
What's up?
That cyclone's
tracking fast
from southeast.
All right. Let me know
if anything changes.
What are you--?
I just happened to be
in the area.
Yeah.
I heard WNN hired you.
And you're hosting it.
Congrats.
They needed someone
who could climb K2
and look presentable.
Wasn't exactly a rush.
That's not true.
They wanted the best.
I read about you on the Eiger,
the fastest female ascent.
Yeah.
Dad would be proud.
Annie--
Peter. . .
So when you leaving?
Early tomorrow morning.
We want to be summiting
by 2:00 Wednesday.
What does the mountain
say about that?
I mean, I always thought
you laid siege to it.
Kind of made a run at it
when you could. I didn't
know it could schedule it.
It's a plan, Peter, that's all.
Vaughn's an aggressive guy,
but he knows what he
wants and he goes for it.
I admire him.
How long have you known him?
Wherever you're trying
to go with this,
you're wrong.
I'd never anybody
affect my climbing.
"LITTLE OL' WINE DRINKER, ME"
Was that two of them,
Cyril?
Or has this stuff just gotten
better than we thought?
VAUGHN: Frank.
FRANK: Good to see you.
Good to see you, man.
Tommy McLaren. Colorado Kid.
Rock 'n' roll, man. You ready to go?
You lead, I'll follow.
Thattaboy.
There's my leading lady.
Hi, Annie.
How was your trip?
I think my stomach's still up there.
Luckily I passed
on the eggs Benedict.
Excuse me for a minute.
Yeah.
Ed Viesturs.
It's an honor to meet you.
Elliot Vaughn.
Nice to meet you.
VAUGHN:
Hey, you wouldn't believe
this guy. Five times up Everest.
The only man to climb 1 2
of the world's 1 4 highest peaks.
All without oxygen.
Rock on. By comparison,
all of us are merely amateurs.
It's a real honor, Ed.
Welcome to base camp.
Thank you.
Outdoors magazine wants
to interview you.
"Bankruptcy at High Altitude."
How much can we--?
Yes?
Uh. . .
I could go and come back, or. . .
Looking for Skip?
Yeah.
Try the command tent.
Thanks.
Skip?
I'm Peter Garrett.
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
I got your message.
Bad luck about your porter.
I've got four new ones you
can meet tomorrow. Supplies
you need are no problem.
The Swedish hooker's
taking longer than I thought.
There's no shortage of
entertainment around here.
You saw Mr. Vaughn fly in?
He's hard to miss. What's this
about him climbing to a deadline?
Friend of yours, is he?
No, my sister's climbing with him.
Yeah, Annie Garrett.
Vaughn's got this publicity stunt.
He's launching a new airline,
Majestic Air.
He stands on the top of K2
waving as the inaugural
flight goes overhead.
Are you serious?
I'm deadly serious.
Your sister's in good hands.
No one knows these hills better
than Tommy McLaren.
He told Vaughn
he could get him up there.
I know I did.
I'd have told him anything
for $1 million.
Is that what
he's spending?
That's just for Tom. Bought his
company out for the entire season.
Not that I'm pissed off.
Look what I get to drag
to the top.
with dysfunctional
bowel syndrome.
He's got the runs, mate.
Permanently.
The Bench brothers
bet he won't make it
past 1 8,000.
What do you think?
What do I think?
It depends on the odds. I'm so
broke I might have to shove him
in a crevasse myself.
This is Monique,
our base camp manager
and medic. Monique, Peter.
Hey.
We've met. You should look at these.
Don't mind her.
She's French-Canadian.
Some days she's Canadian
and can be quite pleasant.
Today, she's obviously French.
You'll like my brother.
How about some Spanish
mackerel for the bow?
My name's Cyril.
I'm not much,
but I'm all I think about.
Watch out for him,
he's like a dog.
If he sees something
he tries to shag it.
If he can't shag it,
he tries to eat it.
If he can't eat it,
he pisses on it.
But it's easy to tell
us apart,
because I'm the shy one.
I'm the shy one.
No, no, no, señorita.
Señorita.
Hey!
Here you go.
Have a drink
on Mr. Vaughn.
What time's
the laser show?
Is this thing on?
Howdy!
CROWD:
Howdy!
Everyone hear me
all right?
CROWD:
No!
Well, you're the lucky ones.
Welcome to the highest party
in the world !
Okay, maybe I did overdo it
just a bit.
Four years ago, I came here
with a dream to climb K2.
The toughest mountain in the world.
As most of you know,
that attempt ended in tragedy.
On Wednesday,
with the help of Tom McLaren
I intend to fulfill that dream.
And while I'm at it, take care
of a little business, Texas style.
At 0900 hours,
Greenwich Mean Time,
the inaugural flight of Majestic Air
will fly over the summit
and we'll be there to wave them on !
To the other teams climbing,
I'd like to say be safe
and good luck.
WOMAN: Yes.
Right on.
Let's kick up our heels
and enjoy the barbecue!
WICK:
What about the weather,
Mr. Vaughn?
We're hoping for the best. Why?
You know something we don't?
The weather closes in
and people die up there.
Or don't you have
to worry about that?
Anybody who doesn't worry
about that is a fool. Of course we do.
Brian Maki did a high-atmosphere
analysis of the last 4 decades. Brian.
Most years there's
a 9-to-1 2-day lull
before the fall storms start.
On August 2nd,
we calculate an 82 percent
chance of fine weather.
Give me odds like that
in the oil business, I'd be a rich man.
WICK:
Who's the leader, Mr. Vaughn?
Who makes decisions
on the mountain that mean
other people live or die?
Who plays God, so to speak?
There can be only one leader.
It's always the best climber.
In this case,
I've made it clear to everyone
that Tom McLaren is that man.
Even the Pakistanis agree.
They're giving you a 21 -gun salute.
Okay, let's party!
Thanks for that, Elliot.
Really nice.
You climb as good as you talk,
we'll get there.
You know that old guy
who was asking questions?
Montgomery Wick.
Remember Dad used
to talk about him?
They were in
the service together.
He was the army Ranger--
Of course, I remember.
I miss him, Annie.
I miss him just as much as--
I can't talk about it.
You never have.
There's nothing to say.
He's gone, Peter.
Look, you can blame me
all you want,
but that last cam would've failed.
It held the two of us.
You want to do this?
Okay, fine, let's do it.
You didn't give it a chance.
He knew it wouldn't hold either.
Of course he didn't.
We were his life.
He would've rather died than take
a chance anything might happen to us.
I think we owed him the same.
But I did what I thought was right.
If you're so right, how come
you never climbed again?
How come you've
never been to his grave?
I'm not going up there
for a TV show, Peter.
I'm going up there for him.
I want to be the person
he always wanted me to be.
And you know something?
When I'm up there,
I feel close to him.
I touch his soul.
Take care up there.
Hey. . .
this is it.
Wish you were
going with me.
Not this time, kiddo.
Take care up there.
It'll be a great day for Texas.
And Scotland.
AssaIam aIaikum,
Peter.
What is it?
Spindrift coming off the top.
That's local. If something
was coming in, it'd show
on the other peaks.
Your sister's fine, man.
You look after yourself.
You too.
Thanks for everything.
FRANK :
Understood, Tom.
You guys take good care up there.
Thanks, base. Out.
Well, you heard it.
Computer model shows
it's building.
That's a concern.
We're about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?
Yeah.
Let's kick it
and get up there.
Gets any worse,
we'll shelter under
the ice cliffs till it passes.
If it comes in fast,
we're totally exposed out here.
But it's not coming in fast.
He said it's slow-moving.
There's a 70 percent
chance it'll turn east
and miss us.
That's right.
I'm not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.
We're not suggesting
anything stupid.
Sure, the weather could turn.
But the odds are with us.
We're five hours
from the summit.
We turn back now, that's it.
We've lost our window.
I know. Elliot, I'm aware of that.
It's my responsibility.
But I won't let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?
Come on, Tom.
This is about getting
to the top.
I don't give a shit
about the publicity.
This is a life statement for me.
We're only 500 feet from
the bottleneck. Let's keep going.
Okay.
Let's go.
EDDIE:
and falling.
This just came in.
Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.
Thanks, Eddie.
Tom says he's going on. Campbell,
what's base camp pressure?
Pressure's dropped
two points in four hours.
You made your case.
We listened. We decided.
It's too high a risk.
Why am I here
if you don't listen to me?
I'll assess the risk. As to why
you're here, I wonder myself.
I'm Annie's brother.
McLaren's pulling
them back, right?
We're on target.
They're going on.
The wind's hitting a dozen
peaks to the south.
What does your satellite show?
We've assessed
all the satellite data.
We're going up.
It shows bad air
coming in from India.
What the hell
are you guys doing?
How high are they?
What are you doing?!
Warning my sister!
Leave it! That's enough !
Tom McLaren, come in.
PETER :
Tom McLaren,
this is base camp. Do you copy?
Tom McLaren, do you read?
Come in, base.
You've got a major
storm coming in.
You've gotta start down.
TOM:
Who is this?
Peter Garrett.
You copy about the storm?
Where's Frank Williams?
Put Frank Williams on.
Tom, Skip here.
We're looking
at the weather screens.
If this doesn't turn,
you'II be in big troubIe.
Turn back immediateIy.
Yeah.
Tom, do you copy?
Yeah, I copy that.
Thanks, Skip. Out.
How we doing?
I'm pulling the plug.
We're going down.
Just hold on.
I'm sorry, Elliot.
But you pay me
to make these decisions.
I'm paying you
to get me to the top.
Jesus. Elliot, you told me
I was in charge up here.
You are. What's the problem?
Why are you vacillating?
Why? Because some
second-rate guide
got on the radio?
Nobody knows this
mountain better
than Skip Taylor.
Skip Taylor's a hustler.
He was jockeying me
to be in your boots.
Don't crap out
on me now.
Come on,
what did you think?
She'd just lift up her skirt
and pull her panties down for us?
Is this how you got up
Everest twice?
I'm going down.
Fine. Fine.
Go down. Go on. Sit it out.
The storm will turn
and you'll spend the rest
of your life living it down.
That should do wonders
for your business.
I'm sorry, can I? Please.
We're going back!
We don't have a choice!
We are dead on the ridge!
Let's go!
Fuck you !
Ugh !
Ah !
Ah !
Annie!
Annie, can you hear me?
I'm all right! I'm safe!
Elliot!
I'm fine! We're okay!
Avalanche!
Oh !
Ah !
Annie, are you there?
Can you hear me?
Come in, base,
this is summit team.
Do you read me?
Anybody, do you read me? This is
the Vaughn summit team. Come in.
SKIP:
Summit team, this is base camp.
Do you copy? Over.
Summit team,
this is base camp.
If you're gonna do that,
do it outside.
Base, this is summit team.
Are you trying to contact us?
Wait. Here. Let me.
Oh, my God. That's Morse code.
My dad taught us
when we were kids.
Said it could save your life.
Smart man, your father.
He sure was.
There's three
of them.
Vaughn.
Tom.
Annie.
I'm sorry, Kareem.
You say there are three.
Maybe there are others.
Maybe.
VAUGHN:
Tell them we can't keep talking.
We gotta save power.
He's right.
What's he saying, Annie?
They're coming to get us.
It's not gonna be just snow.
It's gonna be ice and rock.
We need special tools.
I don't know how much
we have here.
ED:
And how do you get it
up there, Mr. Garrett?
Then we dig,
with our bare hands
if we have to.
Whatever it takes.
We have more than enough
guys here to get this done.
Jesus. What the hell
do you want to do?
Just leave them there?
Peter.
You can't ask people
to work up there.
You've never been that high.
Just staying alive up there is--
So we just walk away
and forget about them?
Is that what you're saying?
They had one fuel can each.
They can melt ice
and rehydrate for a day.
At 26,000, without it,
their lungs fill with fluid.
That's pulmonary edema,
they die within another 1 2.
That gives us a window
of 36 hours.
Montgomery Wick.
My dad told me
Montgomery Wick
speed-summited in 24.
We're not
Montgomery Wick.
Even if we were, how long
does that leave us to get
through the rock and ice?
We don't even know
their exact location.
How long will that take?
I won't let Annie die.
So what are we gonna do?
Nitroglycerin,
Mr. Garrett.
I wouldn't touch it
with one of those
English barge poles.
The contractors use it
to blast rock for
the gun emplacements.
It's low-freezing
and more powerful than symtex.
My responsibility ends at that door.
I want to make one thing clear.
This is your decision.
It's got nothing to do
with the Pakistani army.
Which is a legal way
of saying I think
it's madness.
Magnificent madness,
though.
Good luck.
Stop!
Skip,
don't move your feet.
Everybody keep
very still.
Okay, Skip.
Let me get this straight.
You want to go up that hill
with nitro on your back
and hope that it doesn't jolt?
That's right.
A hundred thousand sperm
and you were the fastest?
Skip here's agreed to go,
so I need four more.
It'll be a speed ascent,
in pairs, one canister per team.
People have to share?
Won't everyone want
their own bomb?
Ed, you're the best climber here.
I'm not one to walk away
from something like this,
but I think it's suicide.
If we just leave them,
what do you call that?
It's reality. You're willing
to risk six lives to save three?
How do you feel about that?
The same way you do.
Your best friend died on Everest,
didn't he? What if it was him
up there right now?
I will go.
Ali is my cousin. It is my duty.
How about it, Mal? You and Cyril
have been up there before.
No.
No.
Why would we want
to leave this place?
Luxurious accommodation.
Fine cuisine.
Sultry weather.
Frostbite's off my dick.
I reckon we should wait
until they chuck in a ski lift.
Good idea. Imagine coming to the
Himalayas and actually having
to do some climbing.
Imagine.
Especially when you have
to complete your autobiography.
And rustle up those all-important
endorsements. You wankers!
CYRIL:
Hey?!
What's bloody wrong
with you?!
We're in.
We're in.
Thank you.
I need one more.
I'll write a check now
for anyone who goes.
Whether Elliot makes it or not,
I'll be waiting for you
when you get back.
Half a million bucks.
Does that include the tip?
My brother's got
explosives. They're gonna
blast their way down.
TOM:
Blast their way down.
How are they gonna
find us? We might
as well be on Mars.
It's not a question of how,
it's how long.
It's time that's gonna kill us.
We have to lay down a schedule.
A regimen we all adhere to.
Edema sets in
if we don't keep drinking.
Now, I figure, three water bottles,
that's half a cup each,
every 2 hours.
After that, fuel cells to melt ice,
and finally,
we use the dex syringes.
Chances are we're all gonna get
pretty sick,
but if we keep to the schedule,
keep to it,
maybe we can hold out.
Annie, we need to give them the grid
reference for our last known position.
Close as you can figure.
PETER: She says they were
about 300 feet above the Anvil,
heading down east by southeast.
SKIP:
The shoulder ice field.
I checked their
climbing manifest.
This is what they have.
We leave at dawn.
They got 22 hours
if they're lucky.
How high
can we chopper in?
Rasul says 21 ,000.
Any higher, the air's too thin.
He drops us.
How fast can
we get there?
Negrotto Col's
the only place we can land.
From there, 27 hours.
Five hours short.
We need Montgomery Wick.
He's the only man
who's done it faster.
Will he do it?
Four years ago,
a big storm blows
an American team off the hill.
There's nine up there,
including his wife.
She was a guide.
He knows he can't help her,
but he goes anyway.
The only one who did.
He lost all his toes
to frostbite but dragged
They owe their lives to him.
What do you reckon?
Where is he?
On the mountain.
Up the shoulder,
where he always goes.
They never found
his wife's body,
so he keeps looking.
The guy's a lunatic.
That's just what we need.
Yeah. Strap on the nitro.
That's a great idea.
Smoking next to the nitro.
Although, bro and I always hoped
that you'd blow us.
Ah !
Why are you going?
The money, of course.
Skip hasn't paid anyone
in months. You know of
a better way out of here?
Can you climb?
Peter wants to know
if I can climb.
Worst I've seen.
Couldn't climb a ladder.
You're that good, huh?
Yeah. But it was
a very tall ladder.
What the hell
are you doing?
I'm trying to kiss
my ass goodbye.
It's dawn.
If the weather's cleared,
they'll be on their way.
I know.
Thank you.
And your brother?
Has he climbed since Utah?
No.
People say
he lost his nerve.
Have you
heard that?
Yeah,
I've heard that.
Annie!
It's a pack! Quick!
I'm not interested.
You went once before.
Three men owe
their lives to you.
Four years ago.
Now I just climb for myself.
My father was a climber.
Royce Garrett.
He climbed Everest with you.
I don't give a damn.
I don't live my life so you
have someone to look up to.
My sister's dying up there.
How can you just ignore that?
Next time you lecture me,
get your facts straight.
It'll be less embarrassing.
Up there, you're not dying,
Mr. Garrett. You're dead.
What the hell
happened to you?
Vaughn's people
are offering $500,000
to anyone that goes.
Maybe that'll make
a difference.
Why would they do that?
He's one of them.
What's their supply situation?
Enough for 22 hours.
Twenty-two.
Who's coordinating at base?
Vaughn's people.
That's a mistake.
I'll need someone there I can trust.
Taylor, you know the mountain best.
What are you talking about?
Skip's one of the best climbers.
We'll need him.
Before we get started,
let's agree on one thing:
This is not a climbing democracy.
On a rescue, we don't vote,
question or argue.
You listen and do exactly as I say.
Chopper will pick you up
on the way back.
Here's how we'll split it up.
Malcolm, you'll climb with Kareem.
Cyril, you'll--
What? No, I bloody won't.
You've been up
the mountain too long
and forgotten the rules.
Never eat at a place
called "Ma's,"
don't play cards
with a fellow named Doc.
And whatever else you many do,
you never, ever climb
with someone you don't know.
I'm going with my brother.
Frankly, I'd rather climb
with the Sheila.
I'll tell you my rules:
I'm putting a strong climber
with a weaker one.
You'll climb with Kareem.
Mr. Garrett,
you'll be climbing with me.
Cyril. Guess what?
Come on, darling.
Give us a smile, eh !
It's the second best thing
you can do with your lips.
We'll take the west ridge.
Cyril, up through the Mushroom.
Malcolm, Hockey Stick Gully.
I've been up all of them.
Speed's about the same.
We're as high as I can take you !
Move it! I can't hold it for long !
Ah !
Next!
RASUL :
I'm having troubIe
maintaining aItitude.
Ah !
Get out of here!
We're gonna burn ! Go!
WICK:
Go! Move it! Move it!
Ah !
Grab my hand, damn it!
Grab it!
Ah !
Come on ! Come on !
Ah !
Oh, God.
He needs dex. Now.
No.
We stick
to the schedule.
In nine hours, the water
runs out. We'll need it.
Our lives depend on it.
He'll die if he doesn't get it.
He will anyway.
Come on, Annie.
We both know Tom
isn't going anywhere.
You've done your best.
You have.
We can't waste resources
on a lost cause.
Saving somebody's life
is not a lost cause.
It is, if you know
they can't be saved.
Why should three people die
if two can live?
Okay. If that's what you think,
why don't you go tell him yourself?
Tom, can you hear me?
Don't listen to--
He has a right to know.
You're a climber, Tom. A pro.
You know the reality.
Even if they get to us in time,
they can't carry you down.
Not from this altitude.
Now, Annie wants to give
you the dex. I understand that, I do.
But you and I know it's just
delaying what's inevitable.
Just lie here and die, Elliot?
Is that what you're telling me?
I'm not telling you anything.
I'm asking you to respect life,
not to waste it.
If I was in your position--
You're not in my position.
That's right, I'm not.
Understand something.
You're not just killing me.
You're killing her too.
We're on a bit of a deadline, mate.
Can we just leave this till later?
He's all right, isn't he,
this Allah bloke?
He won't strike you dead
if you miss one prayer, will he?
All right. One prayer.
Under the circumstances.
What harm can it do?
Do Muslims believe in hell?
Do you?
So if that thing there blows,
and I don't believe in Allah,
I'm going to hell?
Is that what you reckon?
You're all the bloody same,
aren't you?
Born-agains say I don't
believe in Jesus,
so I'll go to hell.
Jews say I do believe
in Jesus, I'll go to hell.
Catholics say I don't believe
in the pope, I'll go to hell.
So any way you look at it,
I'm in the shit.
Well, go on, then. What did he say?
We gonna die
up here or what?
All men die, my friend.
But Allah says it is what we do
before we die that counts.
Jet stream's rising. I'd say
all clear for the next 48 hours.
Wick, do you copy?
WICK :
Copy.
Pressure's up.
You have clear skies
and light winds. Over.
How Iong wiII it Iast?
You're good
for the next 48 hours.
What is your exact
position? Over.
WICK:
The rock wall, about 400 feet
above Negrotto Col.
What's the hoIdup?
I thought you'd be
at the top by now.
Yeah, so did I.
What's the status
at 26,000? How's the girl?
As far as I can teII, okay.
McLaren's serious.
InternaI injuries. Over.
And Vaughn?
No word.
Keep me informed.
What is this with you
and Vaughn?
You're too slow,
Mr. Garrett. You've
gotta move faster.
Take your hands off me.
It's not your concern.
If it involves my sister,
it's my concern.
I made it clear.
No arguments, no questions.
Look, if you've got
another agenda,
why don't you turn
around and go back.
I don't need you.
Your sister will be dead
in 1 4 hours.
Good luck.
Whoa!
I've got you.
I've got you.
You're as crazy
as your old man.
You did the right thing
in cutting the rope.
Any good climber would have.
If Royce had had the knife,
he'd have done it himself.
I just got some spindrift in my lungs.
WICK :
Summit team, this is aIpha team.
Do you read?
This is summit team.
Come in, alpha.
This is summit team.
Annie Garrett, is that you?
It's Elliot Vaughn. Who's this?
Montgomery Wick.
How many are you?
Three teams, different routes.
I'm with Peter Garrett.
I thought you only climbed solo.
Rescue missions are different.
What's your location?
West ridge, 23,000.
You'll have to climb faster.
Tell Garrett his
sister's got edema.
That'll speed him up.
Wick! Wick, this is Annie Garrett!
Wick! Do you read, Wick?
She needs dex.
It's too soon. She'll have to wait.
Annie.
Get it.
I told you.
I told you not to let her give it to you.
You saddled up that pony,
now she can ride it.
Oh, God.
Vaughn, you're not sick!
Not yet.
We hold to the schedule.
It's the only way to stay alive.
For you, maybe.
You know, Tom, intelligence doesn't
threaten me. Stupidity does.
You arrogant prick! Ah !
We wouldn't be down here
if it wasn't for you.
You were the leader, Tom.
No.
He's right.
None of us
are gonna make it.
You want to survive?
Go and get it.
That's what I thought.
Ah !
Use your ax!
Ah !
Cyril !
Cyril !
I'm here!
MONIQUE:
I'm coming !
Ah !
It's coming through !
Hang on ! It's gonna be okay!
Just hang on.
Ah !
That's all there is.
Ah !
BOTH:
Ah !
You see the rocks to your left?
Yeah, I can see them !
I'm gonna swing you.
Ah !
VAUGHN:
Look out!
Ah !
Cyril ! Cyril, are you there?
Peter, are you there?
Malcolm ! This is Peter!
I repeat, this is Peter.
It wasn't us!
Cyril, you answer me, you bastard !
Cyril !
Cyril, are you there?
Cyril !
Damn it, you answer me!
Nag, nag, nag.
They always bloody nag.
You're sick.
Ah !
They could
still be alive.
I'm going back.
Mr. Garrett.
Your sister has pulmonary edema.
We don't have the time.
Monique and Cyril
are question marks.
Your sister is not.
Bro, I'm sorry.
We gotta go.
Ah !
Ugh !
You gotta straighten it.
Go ahead.
It'll be fine. Just look me--
Don't bullshit me, Peter.
I'm a nurse.
Where were you going?
What are you talking about?
Where will you go with the money?
Anywhere!
Tell me.
Paris.
I did two years of premed.
I wanted to finish it.
Any career worth this?
Two years on Everest,
three at K2.
I've had enough.
Skip makes the Pakistanis
look well-organized.
He's sexist son of a bitch.
How long you been
sleeping with him?
Two years, and screw-- Ah !
Ah !
My friend
I think you should turn back.
AssaIam aIaikum,
Colonel Salim.
Wick, do you copy?
Wick, this is base camp.
Do you copy?
Come in, base.
The nitro reacts
to the sun. I repeat:
Get the nitro out
of the sun.
Get that goddamn pack out of the sun !
It's gonna blow!
Get the pack in the shade!
The nitro! It's gonna blow!
Get it out of the sun !
In the shade! There it is!
Malcolm ! Can you hear me?
It's not their call time!
They can't here you !
Malcolm, do you read?!
You take the shoulder.
I'll try the ridge.
MONIQUE:
Malcolm !
Malcolm !
Kareem !
Malcolm ! Kareem !
Can you hear me?!
You guys! Your radio!
Turn on your radio!
Malcolm !
Come in, Peter.
Peter, are you listening?
Malcolm, get the nitro into the shade!
Do you copy me?
Please, Peter, repeat.
I don't understand.
PETER :
Get the nitro into the shade right now
or it wiII bIow! Do you understand?
WICK:
Don't touch her.
Is this what you're looking for?
Four years ago,
an American team
got blown off the mountain.
She was the guide.
What happened?
She take shelter
with Vaughn?
Twenty-four, thirty-six hours.
I figure she died of edema.
Wouldn't have happened
if she'd had dex with her.
You're wasting your time.
You think he used it for himself?
Answer me, damn it!
Of course he did !
How long have you known?
Since they interviewed him.
He said the dex got swept away.
That was a lie.
She always carried it on her.
Four years, Wick?
The mountain owns him.
He had to come back.
Now you're gonna kill him.
My wife died of edema.
It stripped the skin from her throat,
filled her with water.
She drowned
in her own bodily fluids.
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.
I can't let you do it.
Peter, do you know where you are?
Above 24,000, you're at the
vertical limit, you're already dying.
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.
If you think you can stop me,
go ahead.
Peter. Are you there?
Peter.
Annie. Annie, is it you?
Annie. Annie, what is it?
Where are you?
Five hours away.
I want you to go back.
Annie.
Don't risk it. There's no reason.
I won't be here and neither will Tom.
How long?
An hour. Two at the most.
Peter--
Peter. Peter.
I'm here, Annie.
I've been thinking.
I've been thinking a lot about Dad.
We shouIdn't have
gotten him a grave.
We should have come up here
together with his ashes.
Remember how he talked?
This is where he was happiest.
He was a cIimber.
I think every reaI cIimber
wouId want to stay on the mountain.
What do you think?
I think we'll come back some day.
The two of us.
For Dad.
I would've liked that.
I'm coming to get you, Annie.
No, don't.
Promise me. I don't want you to die.
I can't let you do that.
I don't care!
Don't put me through it, understand?
PIease.
Just. . .
please don't.
Please.
Good night, Peter.
I Iove you.
Are you gonna kill me now?
Yes.
Ah !
Bastard !
Are you ready?
I can't get them to melt.
They're frozen.
Boil the water!
With what?
ANNIE:
Easy.
Easy.
Wait.
Okay. Keep feeding it.
Keep it coming.
Stop! It's leaking !
We can try and push it through
before it rips. On three.
One, two, three!
Ugh !
Annie!
Hold it! Hold it!
Ah !
PETER:
Annie!
No! No!
No!
How is she?
Amazing.
Talk about a will to live.
OnIy one woman
Not the picture
Of the woman you Iove
That's not a song.
It's definitely a song.
There's no way that's a song.
It's a good song.
A winning song, by the sound of it.
I think you're making it up.
That was a hell of a thing
you did up there.
Anybody else would've given up.
Not everybody.
He'd be proud of you.
Angry, but really proud.
Get some sleep.
