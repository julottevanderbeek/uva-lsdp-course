It's about time.
Good morning, Hill.
- Good morning...
- Fugate.
Temple Fugate?
I should think you'd
remember the name by now, counselor.
We've only been taking the same train
every day for...
...one year, seven months and 13 days.
Right. The efficiency expert.
Six minutes behind schedule.
You seem pretty tightly wound
this morning, Fugate.
I have an important court hearing today.
There's been a $20 million judgment
against my company.
My attorney has appealed.
But if we lose, it's the end of everything.
Temple, let me give you some advice.
I'm a lawyer.
Trust me, I know these things.
If that judge sees you looking
as tense and haggard as you are now...
...he'll think you were up to something.
Loosen up. Do something to relax
before you go into court.
Get out of your routine
for a few minutes.
- Do you take a coffee break?
- Of course.
Every day at 3 on the dot.
Then take it at 3:15.
- But my schedule!
- Forget your schedule for one day.
Believe me,
it will make a new man out of you.
I needed those five minutes ago.
- I'm sorry, sir, but...
- Thirty-seven pages?
That would take a copier exactly
one minute and 49 seconds.
- One more delay like this and you're fired!
- Your coffee, sir.
And those court documents you requested.
Put that in a thermos, Ms. Perkins.
You little brats!
No! No!
Don't do this to me!
My lawyer needs those papers.
Due to his failure to appear...
...this court finds your client in default.
Summary judgment against him stands...
...at $20 million.
No! You can't! I'll be ruined!
Then perhaps this will teach you
to be on time for a change.
Are you quite sure you won't
stop for breakfast, Master Bruce?
The meals they serve at these fundraisers...
Ghastly.
Alfred, Mayor Hill will put out
a good spread.
He knows you don't start a reelection
campaign by poisoning supporters.
If he were in a hurry to get to the food...
...he'd be ahead of us
instead of behind us.
I take it taxi drivers are no longer required
to obey traffic signals.
- Climb off it, geezer. You had the red.
- It's nobody's fault.
Look.
The traffic signals are malfunctioning.
What the devil?
It's the same thing all the time.
I'll sue you.
There's the foul-up. Mayor over-the-Hill.
Nothing works right in this city no more.
I fear this does not bode well
for his campaign.
No. No, it doesn't.
And that may be exactly the point.
Another piece of outlandish graffiti?
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?
- Hold it!
- Well, well.
The Batman. It's about time
you showed up.
I suppose you want to know
why I've brought downtown Gotham...
...to a standstill, Batman.
Well, let's just say it's because
I'm a civic-minded citizen...
...with a lot of time on his hands.
I want some answers, wise guy.
- Talk!
- A pity.
I don't know what to tell you, Batman.
Except perhaps that the 9:15...
...is always six minutes early.
If the creep with the clocks
did sabotage the entire traffic system...
...he had to have come here to do it.
Wait here.
My pleasure. This is one of the finest
back alleys in all of Gotham.
What kind of saboteur...
...uses a $6000 Metronex
to trigger a time bomb?
A saboteur with too much money?
Most jewelry stores register
the serial numbers...
...of the Metronexes they sell.
Let's see what the police database
turns up.
"Temple Fugate. 362 Brayfogle."
Let's go, Alfred.
It appears Mr. Fugate's neighborhood
has seen better days.
What is it about
that particular clock tower?
He's got more data on it
than anything else in the city.
There's been a slight blackout.
Just one city block,
between Schiff and Robinson.
West of Molldorf.
The location of Gotham Mutual's
main branch.
No doubt some malefactors
blacked out the bank...
...to disable the locks on the vault.
Yes, the time locks.
- Fugate.
- Fugate.
adieu,
This magnificent station...
...home of the world's first
fully automated subway line...
...is the fulfillment of my pledge to you...
...to make our subways safer
and more efficient.
And so I declare
Gotham Central Station...
...officially open.
Let the first train arrive!
Where is it?
What an embarrassment.
I wanted that train here
at 2:30 on the dot!
Only minor injuries. Thank God.
Hill! Where's Hill?
Comfortable, Hill?
Well, you won't be for long.
At 3:15 on the dot,
those hands will come together...
...and you'll be crushed like an insect.
- Does that time hold any meaning for you?
- I don't know what you're talking about!
You told me to take
my coffee break at 3:15.
- What?
- You don't remember?
My court date?
Oh, my Lord! The lawsuit!
Fugate, I swear I was only trying to help.
Don't hand me that.
You did it on purpose.
The plaintiffs were represented
by your law firm, Mr. Mayor.
But I had nothing to do
with that case, Fugate.
Liar!
Not that it matters anymore...
...now that you have an appointment
to keep at 3:15 precisely...
...with the grim reaper!
I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate.
Don't count on it, Batman.
When it comes to clocks, I am king.
Give it up, Fugate.
Hill committed no crime against you.
He did worse. He made me late!
I could do this all day, Batman,
but your time is up.
I've studied news footage of you.
I know that it takes you...
...exactly 1/20 of a second
to throw a punch.
Very clever. But it only takes me
...to do this.
Fugate! You can't escape!
Batman.
You of all people should know...
...there's always a way out.
Fugate!
He won't be doing any campaigning
for a few days.
But at least the mayor is safe.
No trace of this Clock King, though.
How could anyone survive
a wreck like this?
If I could, he could.
Then...
...you think we'll hear from him again?
- I wouldn't be surprised, commissioner.
In fact, I'd say it's only a matter of time.
