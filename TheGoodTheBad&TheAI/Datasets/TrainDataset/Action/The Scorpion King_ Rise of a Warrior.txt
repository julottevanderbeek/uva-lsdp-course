there arose in the lands between
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,
they became prized as the personal
bodyguards of princes and emperors.
ASHUR: I must follow my faith and I
forbid you to go to the games tomorrow.
You think it's
all honor and glory.
Well, it's not.
I've done some things
that were not noble.
I promise you
that, my son.
You 24 boys are here to show your skills
in the art of fighting.
Only 12 of you will be
chosen to move ahead
and train for six long years to become
the pinnacle of a warrior.
A Black Scorpion!
Ready!
Advance to combat!
Show some mettle if you want
to be Scorpions.
Mercy is weakness!
Layla?
Mathayus?
I thought your father...
I snuck out.
You're crazy.
I'm crazy?
I can fight
as well as any boy.
Oh, really?
Prove it!
Hold!
Girls are forbidden
from the games.
Leave her alone!
Little vermin!
Get him!
Get him back here!
Where do you think you're going?
You dare dishonor
the games by interfering?
Lay a hand on him
and you won't live to regret it.
Arm yourself.
I'm not in the mood
for killing today.
Father!
Arrest them both!
And the girl.
HAMMURABI: Wait!
SARGON: King Hammurabi!
They make a mockery
of the ancient games and insult me,
the commander
of your armies.
That may be, Sargon.
But Ashur has earned himself
some forbearance.
I am in your debt,
My Lord. As always.
And you may repay it
by sending your boy
to the Scorpions for training.
If he makes half the mercenary
his father was,
he'll serve the nation well.
You will pay for this.
I promise.
ARI: The king's general, Sargon,
had always resented Ashur's fame.
Father!
Father!
TRAINER: You fight
like a woman.
Mathayus had left Nippur a boy,
and he returned a man.
And as he would shortly learn,
much had changed while he was gone.
For these six years past, you have seen
neither kinsman nor any friend,
but blade,
shield and shaft.
You have trained hard.
Some have fallen
by the wayside.
Those who
yet stand before me
represent the pinnacle of generations
of Akkadian fighting prowess,
the Order of
the Black Scorpions.
Go forth proudly to wherever your king
may send you.
Fight nobly!
Bring gold to
our nation's coffers
and honor to
your family names!
Oh, Mom!
Look at you.
You're a man now!
I barely recognized you.
NOAH: Mathayus! Mathayus!
Mathayus!
Noah!
What do they
feed you, rock stew?
I see you've grown, too.
He eats Enki's portions
as well as his own.
Where is Enki?
Why didn't he come?
He ran away
from home last year.
He's left to
find his fortune.
He'll be back.
Well, well, look at the proud new
Black Scorpion.
I see you've come
to pay your respects, Layla.
I can take you on
and don't you forget it.
Does that sting?
Only if you
dare touch it.
OFFICIAL: All turn and hail
Sargon, your king!
Present King Sargon!
I heard rumors.
You heard the truth.
Hammurabi's death was no accident.
Sargon killed him.
Such talk is dangerous.
MAN: Careful with your words.
Our top graduate, Sire.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
I think not, Sire.
Ashur was his father.
Ah.
Your father was a skillful warrior
and a patriot.
I trust you will
honor his memory.
Send him to
the palace later.
I may have a special
assignment for him.
SARGON: You call
yourself a fighter?
Get up!
You better show me
some skills.
Is that all you've got?
You're nothing.
Don't just stand there.
Come to me.
There's no place for timidity now that
the scorpion rides on your shoulder.
You're wondering
about their tattoos.
One for each man
they've slain.
You'd like a few of your own,
wouldn't you?
If they deserve
to die, yes.
We all deserve to die.
The only question is in what manner
and how soon.
As a member of
my personal bodyguard,
it'll be your job to insure that you
die long before I do.
Your personal bodyguard?
It's a great honor,
Mathayus.
Beyond the skill and strength
I'm told you possess,
the first requirement is an absolute and
unwavering loyalty to me,
your king.
Show him what I mean.
Hail Sargon!
Are you capable
of such loyalty, Mathayus?
I...
Yes,
Sire.
Good.
Then riches and glory will be yours.
But, Mathayus,
betray me even once
and you will pray to the gods
for a quick death.
We'll talk again
in the morning.
GUARD: Pick one for the night.
Or two or three.
Don't wear yourself out.
CONCUBINE: Or three.
I hear you're
quite the swordsman.
I'm not quite polished yet, Sire, but
I'm a quick learner, I hope.
I like you, Mathayus.
Bring in the prisoner.
He was overheard
slandering my name.
And the punishment is death.
Wait. But this is my...
I know.
You do the deed yourself,
you prove your loyalty to me
beyond a shadow of a doubt.
I'll permit you
to make it quick.
Mathayus! I'm sorry.
Is this true?
Did you slander the king?
Mathayus! Please!
Answer me!
Are the charges true?
Yes.
Then you deserve
what's coming to you.
You've not only betrayed your king,
but your family as well.
And you've disgraced
our father's name.
Whatever you do,
don't flinch.
Run, Noah!
I said run!
No!
Go.
We stand
and fight together.
Mathayus, behind you!
You killed my father.
This is for him.
Your father was a traitor.
As are his sons.
Turnabout's fair play.
Let's go!
Out the window.
SARGON: Kill them!
Noah, come on!
GUARD: Come back! Stop!
MATHAYUS: Go! Go!
Hold on!
Noah, what's wrong?
Just hold on.
We're almost safe.
Noah.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Noah!
Noah!
Hang on! Hang on!
Noah!
Noah!
Noah.
Shall we kill him now
or bring him back alive?
Neither. I have special plans
for this one.
You idiot! Now I'm gonna stink of fish
for the next week.
What are you doing here?
And I hate mackerel.
Next time
I'll use tuna.
Layla, why are you
following me around?
First of all,
I am not following you around.
I'm escaping, too.
My parents pledged my hand to that fat
sheep merchant, Muktil.
We're due to be
married in a week.
Congratulations.
You think it's funny.
Well, I don't know who smells worse,
him or his sheep.
Mathayus, I just want
a life of adventure.
And battle.
Like a man.
There's one small problem.
You're not a man.
Thanks for noticing.
Hey!
I heard you tried
to kill Sargon.
Hey, listen.
I will kill that bastard some day.
Everyone knows he makes sacrifices
to the dark gods,
and they've given him
black magical powers.
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
Layla, that's nice, but a girl would
only get in the way.
I'm not just a girl.
Look, we're not kids anymore
playing games.
I see your Black Scorpion training
also included lessons
on how to become
an arrogant jerk.
Congratulations on passing
with flying colors.
Go home, Layla.
Make the sheep merchant's life miserable.
Fine! If that's how you want it.
You're on your own.
Fine.
Fine.
Ticket to Egypt, please.
Ten pieces.
Ticket to Egypt for one.
Ten pieces.
Ten? That's pretty steep.
Plus one for insurance.
And I highly recommend it,
because there are pirates,
hostile natives
and hurricanes.
Just the ticket.
Piracy has already
started if you ask me.
Egypt. For one.
Ten pieces.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Don't push in!
What are you
talking about?
I left the line for 10 seconds
to relieve my bladder.
Liar. Greek.
Madam, I would caution you
never to mix those two words together.
Cretin.
To the land of the pharaohs,
my good man.
Ten pieces.
Ticket.
You are following me.
Admit it.
You know, this may come
as a shock to you,
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.
Then why are you
going to Egypt?
Because...
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.
Why are you going to Egypt?
Personal matters
which don't concern you.
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.
All right.
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.
So, I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.
The Pharaoh of Egypt
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?
I don't remember
asking your opinion.
Actually,
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.
Such as the winged scarab,
sphinxes and cursed mummies.
And you know this how?
Let's just say
I'm well connected.
Really? And who
are you exactly?
Aristophanes of Naxos.
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.
So if you need
any translation services...
Yes, yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.
But you are thinking
along the right path.
To defeat a man like Sargon,
well-versed in the black arts,
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.
Like?
Let's see.
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No, too unwieldy.
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.
The Cloak of...
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!
The what?
Damocles. You know.
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?
Not to touch
other men's swords.
Well, in any case,
according to Book Five of
Herodotus'
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.
Mortal or immortal.
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?
Oh, please.
Anything.
And you know
where this sword is?
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today,
and that is saying plenty.
Oh, and you
have a better idea.
Okay. I've decided.
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.
My friend, such a journey would be
fraught with perils.
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls
suffering unspeakable...
How much do you want?
Exclusive rights to compose
an epic ode of your quest
and one hundred silver staters,
for expenses.
Wait. A hundred?
For risking my life,
it's a pittance.
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.
Here we go.
First of all,
I'm coming along.
Wait. Forget it.
Second, you will treat me with respect
and as your equal.
If not, your superior.
LAYLA: Thirty-fifth, you will launder my
undergarments daily in fresh rosewater.
Forty-seventh, you will bathe and
rub my feet with olive oil once a day.
Don't push it.
Hey, Greek.
Call me Ari, my sweet.
In case you get any funny ideas
about losing us
or making off with my money,
just remember this.
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.
I'm sure that's not the only thing
you're handy at, fair maiden,
whose beauty makes even
goddesses blush with envy.
Hey, save your flowery words
for your scribblings.
Focus on the task at hand,
which is getting
us into that.
Alive.
Of course.
Perhaps, Layla here might use
her feminine wiles
to distract the guards
whilst we slip past them.
This I have to see.
Hi, boys.
Nice night, isn't it?
GUARD: Concubines around back.
Nice.
She is quite the charmer,
isn't she?
You should see her
in a bad mood.
Hmm.
LAYLA: Guys!
Come on, let's go.
These keys
should get us into the palace.
But then we need
to find the labyrinth.
The portal to the Underworld
lies within the labyrinth.
Get down!
Let's go.
GUARD: Intruders
in the palace!
Stop them!
Intruders!
LAYLA: Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm in!
LAYLA: Come on!
Come on!
Ow! Watch your sword.
ARI: I think
I've found something.
I think it's a lever.
MATHAYUS: Hey,
don't touch that.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine, too. Thank you.
Who are you people?
Why are you imprisoned here?
He says they are
captives from many lands.
All brought here
to be fed to the Minotaur.
The what?
What do I expect from people who write
on clay tablets?
The Minotaur.
A creature
half man, half bull.
A crazed monster whose appetite must
be satisfied daily with human flesh.
King Minos believes that the Minotaur
protects the city,
and as long as it lives,
his reign will be secure
and the people will prosper.
And you were
going to tell us when?
At the appropriate moment.
Speak up sooner next time.
We don't even know who this guy is.
Who will join me
in battling this monster?
You'd rather
sit here in terror
and squeeze out a few more
wretched days of life
than die fighting honorably
for a chance at freedom?
My friend, you are wasting your breath.
Most men are slaves to their fears.
Then it's the three of us.
I would just
get in the way.
No doubt.
MATHAYUS: At least
she came strapped.
Nice.
This way.
MATHAYUS: Stay behind me.
LAYLA: As you wish.
I've never heard those words
from your mouth before.
You're not scared,
are you?
Don't be ridiculous.
You?
Please.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
Which way is it?
Let's go this way.
Okay.
That Akkadian
looked familiar to me.
Who was his father?
A famous mercenary
named Ashur.
I was afraid of that.
Men.
Illyrian honor calls.
Yeah, I was afraid of that.
I feel like we're going in circles.
Weren't we just here?
MATHAYUS: What
the hell is this?
LAYLA: It smells like death.
What?
What?
Stay back.
Here.
Where are you going?
Now I'm scared.
Let's go.
Now!
Shouldn't we
be following him?
He's out of his mind.
Or not.
You've gotta be kidding me.
MATHAYUS: Layla!
Ugly old slab of beef!
Your mother was a cow!
MATHAYUS: Don't worry.
It didn't go too deep.
A little higher up and you would
have been in trouble.
A little higher up and you might
be in trouble.
You'll be okay.
Wait here.
Your silence is praise enough.
That was you?
Music has charms
to soothe the savage beast.
Say, that's good.
I'm sorry for your loss,
but most grateful
for your help.
It was a debt
I owed your father.
We fought together in the war against
the Hittites.
And he saved my life.
Your debt is repaid then.
Damn right it is.
Let's go, men.
Where we're going we could use
some brave fighters.
There's strength in numbers
and great riches to be had.
Where?
Tell him.
You tell him.
I'll tell him.
The Underworld.
Oh, the Underworld.
There's a portal inside the center
of this labyrinth.
Well, good luck to you.
No one has ever returned alive
from that place.
MATHAYUS: Gilgamesh did it.
Never heard of him.
So did Herodotus.
So he claims.
Do you know
what else he claims?
When he visited the Underworld
he saw with his own eyes
enough gold, diamonds and rubies
to fill a thousand arenas.
He was literally crunching on a fortune
with every step.
But you, veteran warriors, wouldn't be
interested in such a hazardous journey
as that taken
by an old Greek historian.
And soon by a poet, a young Akkadian lad
and a girl.
Greeks. Greeks.
Okay.
Wait. Why is he coming?
Well, I thought
we could use the extra body.
I told him the Underworld
was a shortcut back to China.
Now what?
ARI: The portal is
in here somewhere.
