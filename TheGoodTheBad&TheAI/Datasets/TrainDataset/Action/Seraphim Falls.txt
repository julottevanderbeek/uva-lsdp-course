Well, we definitely got him.
It's a gut shot, but we got him pretty good.
He didn't even take his rifle.
His horse run off, though.
Cleared up some.
We ought to get a move on.
Let him bleed.
If he keeps going down,
he's going to get some distance on us.
He ain't going nowhere.
We let him bleed.
Well, let's just get paid up
and be done with it.
- He went in.
- Yep.
There's no tracks on the other side.
He done gone over them falls.
Ain't no body.
Well, he went in that there water...
There ain't no body.
There ain't gonna be no body.
- There's always a body.
- You expect us just to conjure him?
I expect you to find him.
That's what I'm paying you for.
Stay, stay.
Stay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Y'all smell that?
Oh, fuck.
Don't touch it.
He's doubled back on his tracks.
Hayes, you and the kid follow those two.
Pope, you take that one.
Mr. Parsons, you wait here.
I'll take this one. He's not far.
So watch yourselves. I got his gun.
He ain't bleeding no more.
Yes, he is.
Where's Pope?
The intervals are 10 feet.
Be ready. He's here.
Remember, if you kill this son of a bitch,
you will not be paid.
Extremities only.
God damn it. Oh, hell.
Lord almighty.
What did he do to Pope?
Mister, who the hell is this man?
Get the horses. We have him now.
He must be part Indian or wolf.
- Eat a man like that.
- He didn't eat him. Go.
Go.
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?
I guess it makes sense.
- Finished off by a young'un.
- I ain't no young'un.
And I don't care to hear you say
another goddamn thing.
Now, come on out of there
and put your hands out in front of you.
Come on.
You been shot.
Trying to steal somebody else's horse,
I reckon.
I'd say you need a new line of work, mister.
Nathaniel!
Nathaniel! Come on.
Come on, now.
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
- Who is he?
- Horse thief.
But he's hurt.
I'll pay for the horse.
You best rest yourself.
Pa'll be home after a while,
and he'll decide what to do with you.
No more tracks, Carver.
The trail's gone cold up there.
Your sister...
She don't take kindly to thieving.
There's plenty of time for that
when you grow up.
See that.
Yeah, he's still bleeding.
There's something else down here.
- Take a look.
- Yeah.
What'd you see?
Charlotte.
We caught him trying to steal Red.
He's hurt. Shot.
Who are you, mister?
I do some trapping a bit north of here.
Must be quite a bit north of here.
Quite a bit.
I don't expect you shot yourself.
No. No.
Somebody after your hides?
Fringing on your territory?
I couldn't say.
You come down out of that pass
without a horse?
Up here, a man without a horse
is generally a dead man.
That I can solve.
So I don't take kindly to a man
trying to steal mine.
Like I told your girl, I'll pay for the horse.
It's only about six days' walk
from here to town,
as I recall.
I'll pay you twice what you paid for her.
If you can pay,
why don't you just walk yourself
down there?
I'd rather not.
- Nothing there.
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I'll go down there and take a look.
- No.
We're done here. We'll follow the ridge.
That's 16 days. Seventeen out Mount Olive,
- at $1 a day.
- You'll get your money when we find him.
Not before.
What do you mean? You saw.
That trail ends down
at the end of that ravine.
'Cause he never went down the ravine.
We follow the ridge.
Come here.
I'm Gideon.
You don't talk much, do you, boy?
You know, it's not considered polite
to shoot a man
who's sleeping in your house.
Well,
get on back to bed.
Where is he?
- Who the hell...
- I'm doing the asking here.
- Coffee and biscuits, woman.
- Now, lie to me
and I will fire this place with you
and yourn in it.
- Now where is he?
- Must have left at first light.
We done got here at first light. Damn fool.
- Were he able-bodied when he come here?
- No.
- Did you give him supplies or a rifle?
- No.
- He had a pistol.
- Took that off of Pope after he killed him.
- You give him a horse?
- No.
Ain't no horse for that one.
Mister, I don't know where you come from,
but we helped a shot mongrel of a man,
and he's gone away in the night,
and that's all we know.
You lying son of a bitch.
What did you sell him?
What did the devil get for his money?
Hayes.
I ain't paying you to play with womenfolk.
Tell me about the man who came here.
If I think you're lying,
I'll kill your brother
and hand you over to Mr. Hayes.
He was here,
and he left in the night.
- Stole a mare, looks like.
- What about that gold?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I took it.
He was sleeping. I took it from his bag.
I only wanted a gun
to protect us.
Son, nobody can protect nobody
in this world.
The sooner you realize that, the better.
Pope's horse stays.
You son of a bitch.
No wonder you don't talk much.
Too busy thieving.
How do you write "wife"?
Kid, that's W...
H-O-R-E.
Don't much matter how you spell it,
a woman ain't gonna be yours
unless you're paying her for the night.
You pay her to be sweet to you, kid,
that's all.
Don't never mix up money and love.
Toss the pistol.
What do you want?
I'd have thought that it was obvious,
seeing as how I've been shooting at you.
Keep them hands out.
Turn around.
Why are you doing this?
Seraphim Falls.
Colonel Carver.
Turn around. I wanna see your face.
- What?
- Double watches the rest of the night.
You'll be on him before long.
He was here today.
Watch the sides.
Make sure he didn't break off and cover.
Jesus Christ.
He's still breathing.
We got to get this thing off him.
Parsons, see about that horse.
Well, now we got some discussing to do.
Right here and now.
We ain't negotiating based on
tracking no killer like this.
You're being well-paid.
We're 18 days on a 30-day commission,
- and two of us is already dead.
- Can't say I'm surprised.
The man we're after
preys on the weak and unprepared.
I'd advise you to take this as a warning.
Well, what if we just decided
to take that as our walking papers?
You are, of course,
free to do that, Mr. Hayes.
You will, however, do it without
the assistance of my horse on which you sit.
Am I clear, gentlemen?
We'll keep on.
But we want to split the pay
that's due them, instead.
Done. Now we've got distance to cover.
If our man makes it to the low country,
we'll likely never see him again.
Wouldn't catch me complaining about that.
Morning, stranger.
I didn't figure any transients this far up.
I'm just passing through, is all.
You need some whiskey?
We got some whiskey.
Shut up, Horace.
No, I can't say as I'm looking for whiskey,
but I sure could use some food.
Looks like you boys
have got other things on your mind.
Would have been helpful
if you hadn't seen those.
Well, if you ain't planning on eating,
I'll just be getting on.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
You see, we is fugitives from the law.
They catch us, they're gonna string us up.
Horace, if you don't get quiet,
I'm gonna hang you myself.
It don't much matter to me.
I'm just looking to be left alone.
Same as you.
So, I'll be on my way.
You look powerful familiar, mister.
I know you?
I doubt it.
I'll be damned.
That's one of McClellan's boys
up at Antietam.
Ain't you gonna kill him, huh?
Waste of a bullet.
He's so banged up and hungry,
he won't make it to town anyway.
Lost both his sons
in one day at that goddamn bridge.
- I seen it myself.
- Yeah?
But nothing touched him.
Not a scratch.
Not a splinter.
They say he killed over 100 men
that day alone.
Him? Nah.
Hey, you use some of that money
to get yourself some spectacles.
Still, Virgil, the way you shot that teller,
I thought you'd be itching to do it again.
I'm itching to get out of here. Get going.
Goddamn right. Let's go.
Don't ever go chasing after that man.
If you don't shoot him,
I swear to Christ I will.
We can't be letting no stranger,
whoever the hell you think he is,
just walk into town
and tell them authorities where we gone.
- Let's go. Come on.
- Take care of it myself.
Horace!
Horace, come on!
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop walking.
Let me be, boy.
Best just go on back up to your kin.
Mister, I never shot nobody
in the back before.
So it's best you just turn around,
- and you get what's coming to you.
- Boy,
now you put that gun up and go on.
Turn around.
You're a fool, boy.
I told you to let me pass on.
Hey!
There was three of 'em.
Two of 'em went on up,
one went down that way.
- Look familiar, gentlemen?
- Figure it's him that done it?
'Course it's him.
Who else would be dropping folks
like owl pellets out on these hills?
If he's got himself another horse,
we won't catch him before sundown.
I reckon we ought to move
down valley, then.
He won't be heading toward Carson City.
Come on. Let's get off these cursed hills.
You two can go on without me.
What?
Those boys have been wanted
for six months.
He's worth 250 in Carson.
That's a damned sight better
than what he's offering.
And this boy don't require no chasing.
- You can't just leave.
- The hell I can't.
You would, too,
if you knew what was good for you.
The posse's take is all yours
when the ride's done.
No less than 120 and you don't have to ride
with a stinking corpse, neither.
All right.
You sure?
You go on and get yourself killed. I'm done.
Okay.
Let him earn that 250 the hard way.
He ain't never going to make it
to town without a horse.
I told you boys. Them horses are mine.
We can water your mare.
She looks hard-ridden.
Mercy to the beast is blessed
in the eyes of the Lord.
He sees your sin.
That's all you got.
I don't know you.
