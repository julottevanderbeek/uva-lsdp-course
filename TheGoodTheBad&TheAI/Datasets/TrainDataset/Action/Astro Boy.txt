Here we are, floating
peacefully in the sky.
Metro City,
the jewel in the crown.
Beautiful, isn't it?
But how did we get here?
A century ago, the founders of Metro
City saw that our world was changing.
They took Mount Sofia and
lifted it from the Earth...
and into the sky, to be an oasis,
a floating paradise.
We don't really know
what happens these days
on the strange and mysterious
Surface we left behind.
But life in Metro City
is better than ever, thanks to...
our friends, the robots.
Robots do our shopping.
They cook for us and serve our meals.
They take good care of us.
They even do really
important things
like remind us to call Mom
on her birthday.
Whether it’s raising our kids,
building our buildings
taking care of our city, or
making sure we're all healthy...
for these guys, no job is too big...
or too small.
Plus, robots do a lot
of things that, frankly...
we just don't want to do anymore.
Oh, no!
Don't worry, folks,
that street will get clean.
The best and brightest
of them get picked...
for the more exciting tasks.
This lucky guy is starting
the first day at his new job.
And it’s all thanks to Dr. Tenma...
Head of the Ministry of Science...
and father of Modern Robotics.
Thanks to him, life is easy
for us all in Metro City
Toby, isn't that your dad?
It sure is.
Our friends the robots help us.
Thousands are created every day...
and thousands are disposed of in the...
great, unending cycle that sustains
life in our great city.
Thanks for everything, guys.
May you rust in peace.
Okay, students, ready for a pop quiz?
What?
Begin.
I am so busted.
Yes, Toby. Is there a problem?
I'm just finished and
I'd like to leave.
Finished?
For rocket science,
it wasn't exactly rocket science.
I don't suppose there's much
point in you staying.
Good luck.
Just like his father.
Hello, Master Toby.
Did you have a good day at...
Think fast, Orrin.
Thank you, Master Toby.
Very good throw, by the way.
- Hello, son.
- Hello, sir.
- How was school?
- Oh, great.
Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us...
but I'm pretty sure I got 100%.
That's good, but I don't want you
to become complacent.
You must keep studying.
Onward and upward.
Sure, Dad.
I know I said we'd go to
that symposium on quantum...
mechanics, but I have to take
a rain check again.
But, you promised.
I'm sorry, but it's unavoidable.
President Stone has brought
forward the unveiling of...
the Peacekeeper.
The Peacekeeper?
You've got to be kidding me!
I never kid. Goodbye, son.
The Peacekeeper?
Orrin, change of plan.
Take me to the Ministry of Science.
I'm sorry, Master Toby. Your
father gave me strict orders to...
Stop that!
What are you doing back there?!
Next stop, Ministry of Science.
You ready to blow me
away today, Tenma?
To make my hair stand up,
to knock my socks off?
Metaphorically speaking, yes.
That's the spirit.
Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague
of mine, Mr. President.
He may be resistant to having
his discovery used...
for military purposes.
You leave Dr. Elefun to me.
- Dad!
- Hold that kid!
Why are you here? I gave Orrin
specific instructions to...
I wanted to see the demonstration.
You always talk about
the Peacekeeper and...
Really, Toby?
- Your boy?
- Yes, sir.
Let him tag along.
Releasing potential threat.
It'll be good for him. Educational.
Yes, sir.
You're interested in robots, son?
Robot weapons?
Absolutely, though the latest
D-Class Interceptor...
underlying
deployment-to-target system...
is quite old-fashioned.
Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid.
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.
What the...
- Dad!
- I think it's for the best, Toby.
But you said
I could see the Peacekeeper.
You still can, on tonight's
news with everyone else.
Ladies and gentlemen...
allow me to present Blue Core energy.
- Wow.
- Blue Core energy.
A new self-sustaining power source...
much stronger than nuclear energy,
and infinitely cleaner.
The raw materials came from space.
A fragment of a star millions
of light-years away...
that no longer even exists.
This is now all that's left of it.
Properly harnessed,
this small sphere could transform...
not only Metro City, but life
for those on the Surface as well.
Imagine cleaning up Earth's water.
Imagine bringing back
the forests. Imagine...
overcoming the effects of
centuries of pollution.
I know he's a bit of a dreamer,
but he's a brilliant scientist.
He's a dangerous idiot who
happens to have a high I.Q.
Unfortunately there's no such
thing as a free lunch.
When we extracted
the positive blue energy...
from the fragment,
we were left with...
this highly unstable by-product,
negative red energy.
Oh, I like that one.
Women voters are partial
to the color red, you know.
Until we discover how to
safely dispose of it... What...
What are you doing? Stop!
Keep the cores apart
or you'll kill us all!
Do as he says.
This is outrageous!
What are you intending to do with it?
I'm gonna give the people of
this city a reason to re-elect me.
How?
The only way you can.
I'm gonna kick some butt.
This is so unfair.
Cool off, hotshot.
Please don't leave me in here!
I can't stand small places.
Anywhere but here!
You're 13 years old.
It's time you grew a backbone.
Thanks for the life lesson,
and thank you for this.
As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.
You know as well as I do,
without military funding...
all of our research, including yours,
would grind to a halt.
Start it up.
I told President Stone,
"you gotta bring out the big guns."
Onward and upward, Toby.
Load the Blue Core.
Hold on. This Blue Core,
it's all sweetness and light, right?
'Save the dolphins,'
"Give peace a chance,” and so forth?
It's pure positive energy.
Call me a dreamer,
but I think we'll get...
a bit more bang for our buck
using the red one.
You're not joking?
We're not putting something
that dangerous...
into something that dangerous.
I've got an election to win.
I need my robot to be
a fighter, not a lover.
Load the red one.
I won't.
Then I'll do it.
Move over, sweetheart.
- Hey!
- No!
It's like a video game.
Core loaded.
Piece of cake.
Activate weapon drones.
I hate this job.
Whoa. I gotta get a better look.
- Time to check the classifieds.
- I hear you.
It's using that drone against
the other drones.
How's that possible?
It's called "adaptive technology."
It can absorb and control anything.
I may have flunked out of college...
but I was right about the Red Core.
You scientists think
you're the only ones with brains.
Sir?
Dad!
Dad!
- Toby!
- Dad!
I can't open it!
- Toby!
- Dad!
It's going to be okay, Toby.
I'm going to get you out!
Everything's going to be fine,
I promise.
Toby!
Fire now!
Where's Toby?
Where's my son?
I'm so sorry, Tenma.
Toby.
It's all my fault.
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.
I know.
He's gone crazy, hasn't he?
If you lose your son like that
and you don't go crazy...
you're not a human being.
Clear the lab.
It looks just like him, doesn't it?
A perfect replica.
I've uploaded all of Toby's memories.
It will think it is Toby.
Don't expect too much, Tenma.
It has the most advanced
defense systems ever created.
I won't lose him again.
Did you bring what I asked?
I couldn't refuse a grieving father.
The Core is unpredictable.
I can't guarantee what effect.
It's gonna make it perfect!
Perfect!
Just like Toby was.
Dad?
Toby.
Dad!
Welcome back, son.
Thank you, Elefun. I'm going
to take it... him... home now.
Quality time. Bonding.
All the good things.
Bye, Dr. Elefun.
Bye... Toby.
Incredible.
Dad?
Good morning, son.
How do you feel?
Kind of weird.
Have I been sick or something?
You're fine. You're perfect.
You're wonderful.
That's good, because...
Are you okay?
I must be malfunctioning,
wires crossing...
short-circuiting!
It can't be you. You're...
Oh, my gosh!
You're... you're...
Orrin, are you okay?
You're going to be late to school.
I must say, it's very nice
to see you again.
Sit down, Toby.
I wanna talk to you.
Sure, Dad.
I've decided you shouldn't go
to school anymore, son.
I'm gonna teach you at home... myself.
Sounds good to me.
Orrin, looks like we'll be
hanging out together.
Together?
That'll be very nice, Master Toby.
Oh, dear.
Please, Toby, just let
the robot do its thing.
Sorry.
If you're going to be home-schooling
me, what about the Ministry?
My job now is to be your father.
I am so freaked!
Let's start you out
with something familiar.
Four-dimensional calculus.
It's your favorite.
I guess it is.
If sir wishes, perhaps
I could help Master Toby with...
Bad idea! I'm a robot.
What am I thinking?
Wrong way.
Okay... there.
Excellent.
Yeah.
Interesting solution.
Good.
Bravo. Wonderful, Toby.
First rate, son.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Howdy!
"That fractal's looking fair.
Cosine, tangent, it's a square!"
"Is that secant high or low?
Watch me as I dosey doe."
Let's get back to basics.
Do you remember this one?
Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."
I used to read it to you in
bed when you were little.
To put me to sleep?
Yes! You asked for it every night.
That's not quite what I...
Try re-reading these.
Get the old brain humming again.
Next.
Beautiful.
I got it!
That was close.
Way to go. You're the man.
I haven't has this much fun since,
well, ever.
Check this out.
I'm not knocked out,
but I'm impressed.
That's nothing. Watch this!
Now, that's impressive,
Master Toby!
Just "Toby" is fine, Orrin.
Toby...
I said to read the books,
not destroy them!
I, I just wanted to test
Da Vinci's theories.
I, perhaps...
encouraged Master Toby, sir.
You should not be wearing that hat.
A robot should not be wearing
my son's... Toby's hat.
It's fine.
I don't even like the hat.
I think you should go to your room.
- But, Dad...
- Do as you're told!
Tenma? What's wrong?
I think I've made a terrible mistake.
I thought he would be like
Toby but he's not.
He's strange.
He's very strange.
Strange how?
He's brilliant...
as Toby was, but different.
You can't expect him to be
a carbon copy. Give him time.
You don't understand.
He was meant to replace Toby, but...
every time I look at him,
I'm reminded that Toby's gone...
and he's never coming back.
What's different?
I haven't seen Dad angry before.
Check out the haircut on that one.
It looks like he's got horns.
Horns! Good one!
What do you mean, "horns"
It's gel!
Wait... I can understand you?
That's creepy.
- What is?
- It's like he can understand us.
Don't be a dummy!
I can hear what you're saying!
It's as if he can hear
what we're saying.
There's no way. He's a human!
Let's go leak oil on some statues.
Okey-dokey.
How can I understand what
you're saying? You're robots!
We don't want any trouble.
Wait! I just want to know
what's going on. What happened to me?
Okay, let's back up very carefully.
Oh, no!
Hang on, buddy! We're coming!
That's too freaky for me.
Uh-oh!
Waiter, this steak
is under-cooked.
This is so cool.
I have to show Dad.
How can my approval ratings
be this low?
I was popular in high school.
I cut taxes for influential friends.
What more do people want?
We're tracking an unidentified
flying object over Metro City, sir.
The surface-dwellers
are firing at us?
This is what I've been waiting for!
Declare war on them!
This is going to get me re-elected!
This didn't come from
the surface, sir.
It's my opponent.
He's taken the gloves off.
He's playing hardball.
It's Blue Core energy, sir!
What? Elefun told me
the Blue Core was destroyed.
Get me a location! Mobilize all units!
I want that thing now!
I got here as fast as I could.
Where is he? Where's Toby?
I sent him to his room.
Please just deactivate him and
take him away.
I can't bear to see his face again.
You can't just throw him away
like a piece of junk.
Dad?
What's going on?
Why are you talking about me
like this?
There's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.
You're not actually an
entirely ordinary boy.
I, I know.
I can fly. I can drill through
solid rock. It's amazing.
How did I think this could work?
What's wrong with me?
Why don't you love me anymore?
He's programmed with
the memories of your own son.
Programmed?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
But he isn't my son.
Dad.
I, I'm not your Dad.
You're not Toby.
You're a copy.
Not my son. A robot. And I...
I don't want you anymore.
No! No!
Toby!
I can't see the future, but
I'm sure there's a place for you.
You just have to find it.
He's my father.
This is my home. It's all I know.
Everyone has their destiny, Toby.
Didn't you hear him? I'm not Toby.
Please, Elefun.
It's true.
What?
Sir, we located the signal's source.
It's, it's a child.
Readings for the Core
are off the chart!
Is that Tenma's boy?
Of course not! Holy cow.
Tenma must've lost his mind.
Bring it in.
This is Stinger One.
Set weapons for capture.
Oh, no.
Whoa! He just took off!
Commander, engage the subject
with intent to capture!
What do you guys want?
Command Center,
we have it in our sights.
Ta da!
Oh, my... Oh!
I'm just gonna take these things back.
I'm getting married!
Get him!
Where'd he go?
What?
We've got him. We're coming home.
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, no!
Send in the Spirit of Freedom.
Destroy the robot,
then collect the Core.
You're safe.
Again? What's with you guys?
I love you!
Come on, then!
Fire!
Finish it.
Touchdown!
Where's he going?
It's falling to the surface, sir.
Get him back!
I'm declaring a state
of national emergency!
All military personnel must work
until that boy is found.
Welcome to your new home, kid.
Hello.
Batteries!
He's got new batteries!
Spare a few volts for a fellow Sparky?
New batteries.
Help me, son. I'm fading fa...
Table for one.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Smoking. I'm smoking.
I'm definitely smoking.
You're one of us, now.
Happy to meet you.
Oh, no. I'm not one of you guys.
You're a robot, ain't ya?
Yes, but...
Welcome to the scrap heap.
This is where we all end up
sooner or later.
I'm not ready yet!
- Hey! Get off of me!
- One of us. One of us.
What are you doing?
Incoming!
What do I do?
Dad?
Who's there?
You like me, huh? "Trashcan."
Are you lost, Trashcan?
I know I sure am.
What is it, boy?
Someone's in trouble?
Oh, no.
Trashcan, wait up!
Over here? Whoa!
Is this it? Hello!
They could be miles down.
The hole looks pretty...
deep!
Quick... get the restraints on it.
Hurry!
Good work, boy!
Here's a treat for you.
Hey! Knock it off!
That's not a robot.
It's a kid.
That, that's right.
I'm a kid like you.
What?
We want robots, not kids,
you stupid garbage eater.
Where are you from, non-robot?
I'm from Metro City.
Can you believe that guys?
He's from Metro City...
and he's actually talking to me.
Are you feeling okay?
Oh, my gosh! He talked to me twice.
This is going in my diary...
the most exciting day of my life.
I get it. You don't like people
from Metro City.
Metro City.
Robots waiting on you hand and foot.
I'd love to visit,
just for one day.
You can't. "No losers from
the surface allowed" is the rule.
Why would you want to go?
They think you're garbage.
I mean, look at this!
Can you believe someone just
threw this away?
Finders keepers.
What are you doing down here?
I don' know. Looking for something.
Somewhere.
Did you run away?
Not exactly.
They suggested I find a new place.
Whatever that means.
Dude, it means they kicked you out.
Well, I...
- I'm Zane.
- I'm Widget.
I'm Sludge.
I'm older than her.
By ninety seconds.
And I'm Cora.
What's your name?
It's...
Viva La Roboto-lution!
What just happened?
Did you see the humans' faces?
They were quaking in their
capitalist boots!
Don't worry, brother.
You're safe!
You have been rescued by...
The Robot Revolutionary Front!
I'm Sparx - the brains.
I'm Robotsky - the muscle.
And I'm Mike the Fridge.
I'm the fridge.
You are now liberated!
Go ahead, comrade.
Take your first step as a free robot.
Take it! Take it!
It feels different, doesn't it?
It feels wetter.
It feels wetter! Liberation!
Yeah!
What are you doing?
Sorry. I'll pick it up.
Yes, please.
You look like
an advanced model, brother.
Are you exempt from
the laws of robotics?
Um, remind me?
A robot can't harm or be
the cause of harm to a human...
blah, blah, blah,
boring, boring, boring.
I don't really want
to harm anybody.
Lugnuts!
The RRF are dedicated
to freeing robot-kind...
from human slavery,
by any means necessary.
And he means any means necessary.
What is your name, comrade?
Toby.
Toby?
That's not much of a name.
You want something with a bit
more oomph to it.
Something like,
"The Ice-maker."
Or, "The Annihilator."
Or, "Pauline."
I guess I'll...
Hang on, we haven't come up
with your new name yet.
What about...
What about Astro?
If you can't come up with
a sensible suggestion...
then kindly mind your own business.
Sorry.
Think.
- I've got it!
- What?
Astro!
That's marvelous.
It's modern.
A little space-age. I love it.
Thanks, guys.
I better get going.
Show Astro the plan!
As you wish, comrade.
This is Hamegg!
Nice.
The likes of him enslave our kind.
We need to make an example of Hamegg.
We want to do something so horrible,
so frightening...
so shocking, that the humans
are forced to free all robots.
What are you gonna do?
We're gonna sneak into town.
We're going to lie in wait for Hamegg.
And?
When he shows up...
Yes?
Remember we're forced to follow
the laws of robotics.
Okay.
We are going to tickle him
with a feather!
Viva La Roboto-lution!
That's the plan?
We're already looking into
purchasing the feather.
Blimey!
Are you okay?
How did you find our secret hideout?
You guys need to work
on your camouflage skills.
Don't make us dismantle you.
We just want the kid back.
Kid? What are you talking about?
He's a...
You want a piece of me, tin man?
Be cool. I'm an undercover robot
from Metro City.
I knew it. Viva La Roboto-lution.
These guys aren't doing any harm.
Let's just leave them.
Whatever you say.
Thank you.
The RFF are forever in your debt.
What is your name?
Toby, but that's not who
I really am. You see...
Dude, it's a simple question.
My name is... Astro.
Call me Astro.
Sounds modern.
A little space age. I love it.
I'll be right there.
- Good afternoon. How...
- Excuse me, robot. Thank you.
Search the apartment!
Leave no stone un-turned.
Arrest this man!
Yes, sir.
What are you doing? Stop!
Where is Tenma's robot son?
He isn't here!
What is the meaning of this?
You put my Peacekeeper's Core
into your robot.
I'm running for re-election,
in case you hadn't noticed, and...
we're in an arms race with
the Surface!
An arms race? What nonsense.
It was a stupid mistake.
When I lost my son...
I thought... I'd be able to...
I thought...
I hate losing, too. You want proof?
Ask any of my wives.
But we must get over all
this personal stuff.
You're head of the Ministry of Science.
It's time to move on.
Get the Core back.
Get it in the Peacekeeper.
Let some good come from all this mess.
When you find the robot,
I'll deactivate it...
and give you the Core.
Good man.
Let him go.
Let's hope you never find him.
There's actually people living
in these ruins?
Ruins? This may not look like
much compared to Metro City...
but this is our home.
Here we are.
Come on, Astro.
Whoa!
Sorry.
What's the password?
Don't make me hurt you.
Close enough.
Fore!
Five!
You're out!
We're out of apples.
We're on to grapes.
Did you bring me back something?
The perfect gift for
a sweet little girl.
Thanks!
Be careful!
Too late!
Hey, we're kind of tired!
- Are you okay?
- Sure.
You need ten sets of eyes
around here.
Hey, Hamegg.
Ah-ha! Back so soon?
Did you find anything good
for me today?
I don't know, kids.
A lot of dead batteries.
A lot of elbows here.
The knee joint of a toilet-cleaning
robot? I need heads!
We would've gotten better stuff,
but the...
Whoa!
Well, well.
His name is Astro.
He's from Metro City.
Metro City? I used to work there
once upon a time.
Really?
Why am I running a crummy body
repair shop down here...
when I could be creating state
of the art robots in Metro City?
I, I didn't mean to...
Relax. We're family here.
Asking questions is allowed.
The answer is: I love robots,
especially the discarded ones.
The more banged-up they are,
the more abused...
the more I like getting them
back on their feet.
Wow!
It's almost a religious thing with me.
Kind of like the way
the saints feel about the poor...
or women feel about shoes,
or fat people feel about donuts...
Or... I'll stop with fat people
and donuts.
So, you're not into, um,
enslaving robots?
What?
He ran into the RRF.
I don't enslave robots.
I love robots!
They're our friends.
We rely on them for our daily bread.
Speaking of which,
are any of you misfits hungry?
Let me guess, take-out pizza again?
More like,
"taken out of the trash" again!
Picky, picky.
It's only a couple days old.
This one still has toppings!
Haven't you forgotten something?
What have they forgotten, son?
Grace?
Exactly. Grace!
What?
Would you please turn on the TV,
sweetheart?
There's a dear.
Bon appetit!
Yo, new guy?
You gonna eat that?
You can have it if you want it.
Don't be so nice.
You'll starve to death...
or be the only survivor.
Do your folks know where you are?
I... I don't have any parents.
How very sad.
Did you lose them?
Or, did they lose you?
The truth is, I'm actually a...
I'm a...
A what?
Don't worry, son.
We're all orphans down here.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
None of you have parents?
Parents? Are you kidding me?
This whole place is
a parent-free zone.
I was born in a scrap heap.
I was raised by wild dogs.
Are you sure it wasn't wild pigs?
Are you feeling homesick
for Metro City?
No.
Me neither.
I was the Ministry of Science's head
of advanced robotics.
Right up there with Tenma and
the other mucky-mucks.
What happened?
What always happens to genius.
They were intimidated by
my talent, my ideas...
so they threw me away like an
old battery.
I'm sorry.
Not your problem.
I got a hunch about you, Astro.
There's always room for a good
kid in this family.
Now, how about getting some shut-eye?
Good night... son.
Good night, Hamegg.
I'm gonna tell them.
Just, not yet, okay?
Quit bugging me.
I said I would. I just want
them to get used to me first.
What does Hamegg want all
these parts for?
He's a genius. He can make
cool robots from any old scrap.
Then he puts them into
"Hamegg's Robot Games."
Robot games?
They're a tradition down here.
It's kind of a Roman thing.
It's pretty cool.
You're not going to find much here.
It's a graveyard.
Mr. Metro City's first day and
he's already an expert.
You'd be surprised.
I know a thing or two about robots.
I think we've got something.
See?
Coming!
Look!
What's the matter, boy?
That almost makes me wish
I could read.
Nice try, rust-bucket.
Cora, I think I found something!
That's just an old
construction robot.
It fell to the Surface, like,
a hundred years ago.
Do you think Hamegg could use it?
If he had a robot like that,
he'd make a fortune in the games.
It's just junk.
We used to have picnics in its head.
Just give me a minute.
It weighs hundreds of tons.
What are you going to do,
put it in your backpack?
She'd flip if she knew
I could carry it.
"Zog."
I know you're not dead.
You're just pretending.
Come on, big guy.
Time to wake up.
Let me help you.
Come on.
Show me what you got, Tiger.
Hold it right there,
twinkle-toes.
What are you,
some kind of ice skater?
You plan on ballroom dancing
or fighting with this guy?
That's better!
Now, hit him below the belt.
That's what I'm talking about!
Get him in a headlock and
pound him! Use your thumbs!
Great, kid. I think you've got
the makings of a champion.
Hi, Hamegg!
Sorry about your robot.
What, him? He wasn't really
working out anyway.
This guy's something else!
Look at the legs on this baby.
Look at those feet. No carbon-fiber
plastic junk on this guy.
That's solid pig iron.
Astro got it running, which
I'm still having trouble believing.
It's been dead for at least a century!
How did you do it?
Please tell me!
I, I just kicked it,
like a vending machine.
"Give me back my money!"
It was nothing.
You hear that, kids?
A genius with modesty.
I didn't think it occurred in nature.
You're almost too good
to be true, kid.
Keep this up and
I may just have to adopt you.
Holy cow. This thing's got
enough juice to run a city.
What was that?
Just another machine with
a mind of its own.
Ready, guys?
ZGO
Hey! I thought I was...
and you were...
How did you do that?
I'm faster than I look.
Everybody say 'Limburger.'
Limburger!
Goodnight, Zog.
Hey, Trashcan, you wanna play?
Fetch!
Oops.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Ouch!
Didn't your nanny-bots tell you it's
rude to sneak up on people?
How's your head?
It's still on.
They say that sometimes
when it's really clear...
you can still call through
to Metro City.
You wanna call Metro City?
You've never made a prank call before?
The only thing is,
I can't get this stupid phone to work.
Let me try.
Knock yourself out.
Here. It's kind of weak,
but there is a signal.
Not bad.
The kid has hidden talents.
You have no idea.
Come on, pick up, please.
It's me, Cora.
I miss you guys.
Are you okay?
Sometimes I wonder if
they've even noticed I'm gone.
Who?
My parents.
Your parents?
Now you know the truth about me.
What are you waiting for?
Go tell Zane and the others that...
Cora's from Metro City and
she's still trying to call home.
And that you were raised
by nanny-bots.
Everybody's got secrets.
I won't tell. You can trust me.
You're a good guy, Astro.
Can, can I tell you my secret?
That's what friends are for, right?
Do you ever feel
like you're an outsider?
Like, you're different from
everyone else?
Everyone feels like that sometimes.
The last few days have been
different for me.
Being with all you guys...
and Hamegg...
the thing I need
to tell you is, I'm a...
I'm kind of a...
I'm a...
Yeah?
I'm... I'm really starting to
like it here with you.
With you guys.
Yeah?
We like you too, Astro.
Hey, Trashcan.
I know it's not the same thing, but...
Isn't Hamegg sort of like our dad now?
I guess he is.
Robot Revolutionary Front, transform!
Check, check.
Yeah.
Get off! What part of "ninja-like"
don't you understand?
What's a ninja?
Bring out the secret weapon.
I've been looking for that.
Viva La Roboto-lution!
My fellow Surface dwellers!
Today is the day you've all
been waiting for!
Give the kid in
the red boots a hand, folks!
He got this killing machine up
and running!
Look out, Hamegg.
You are the golden child.
Hamegg really likes you.
I like him, too.
What's he mean by "killing machine"?
The robots fight until one of
them is destroyed.
What?
Don't worry.
Zog is gonna crush them all.
That's what happens at
the robot games?
What did you expect?
Rock, paper, scissors?
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!
- No mercy!
- No mercy!
- No mercy!
- No mercy!
Mercy?
Nice knowing you, kid.
I thought it was a show,
not a slaughter.
They're just robots, son.
I thought you liked robots.
I do, but at the end of the day...
they're just junk waiting to happen.
I know, some of those
advanced ones from...
Metro City are programmed
to smile and laugh just like us.
Really?
Oh, yeah. Unfortunately,
they don't have real emotions...
which is why I have no problem
doing this!
It worked! I don't believe it!
What are you doing?
I stole this from Dr. Tenma after he
fired me from the Ministry of Science.
Who cares?
Why did you do that to Astro?
He's our friend!
I thought I raised you better.
Are you blind?
He's a robot!
That's not true.
It can't be true.
He's programmed to be nice.
He's not really nice.
He's just an incredibly
powerful machine.
But he was so...
I know, sweetheart.
It's got to be tough.
What are you gonna do with him?
Take a wild guess.
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...
and all you riff-raff who snuck
in without buying a ticket...
allow me to present, Astro Boy!
I know. You're wondering
what such a nice looking kid...
is doing in a place like this.
That ain't no kid, folks.
That's a robot from Metro City.
Get this, folks,
Astro personally told me that...
he doesn't think much of our
fighting robots.
Boo!
He thinks they're all
a bunch of sissies!
He thinks you're all trailer
park trash!
He didn't say that.
He didn't say he was a robot either.
This is what we've
all been waiting for...
a fight between the Surface
and Metro City.
Let's get it on!
I'm not fighting.
I'm not doing this.
Yeah! Go, Astro!
Bring out the little stinker!
Will you play with us?
Us?
Yes, us.
Hey, fella.
Oh, no!
Oh!
I have a boo-boo.
Get him! Get him!
Go! Go!
- Stand back!
- What are you...
We've got a feather and
we're not afraid to use it.
I may have spoken in haste.
Why fight, brothers?
A great robot once said...
Me schnoz!
Yeah!
We've located Tenma's son, sir.
I win again!
And now, the final challenger.
A robot so fearsome and powerful,
even I'm afraid to watch.
I give you the mighty Zog!
Oh, no.
No.
How will Astro Boy do
against a robot...
powered with
the same energy he's got.
I'm not fighting you, Zog.
I mean it. I won't fight.
Oh, no.
Yeah!
Great! A love-in.
Some big finale. I said fight!
I won't fight.
Fight!
That's enough!
What's wrong with you?
They're just machines!
They'll do what I tell them!
I'm not gonna get embarrassed...
by some souped-up hot-shot
from Metro City...
or a 100-year-old bulldozer
from New Jersey.
I don't think so!
I'm turning you both off!
Stop!
The laws of robotics!
You can't hurt a human!
It's been that way for fifty years!
I'm old school.
Look!
What kind of robot are you?
We've got to recruit the big guy.
What are they doing here?
Seize the rogue robot and
secure the area.
- Hey!
- Come here.
Zog, stop! Put them down.
It doesn't matter anymore.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Come on.
I'm sorry. I tried to tell you.
Keep moving.
Trashcan, no!
Get off me, you dumb robot!
It's okay.
Oh, no.
President Stone's approval rating
reached a new low today...
when he failed to show up for
a televised debate...
with Robert Logan,
the man many pundits are picking...
as the next President of Metro City.
No darn dirty hippie's gonna
sit in my Oval Office...
eating mung beans and
stinking of patchouli oil.
I've got the Blue Core and...
my Peacekeeper's gonna start
a war with the Surface.
That's bound to get me re-elected.
Why the long face, robot boy?
You're going home to your dad.
Care for a drink?
Very funny, Mr. President.
The experiment is over.
I want the Blue Core removed...
and transferred into
the Peacekeeper now.
Will you help me, Elefun?
This is where we created him.
Well, un-create him. Unplug him.
It's a matter of national security.
Let me talk to him first.
Hello, Dr. Elefun.
Hello, Toby.
Nobody's called me Toby for a while.
This isn't your fault.
You're fantastic.
Absolutely first class.
Superb. Wonderful.
Thank you. I tried to find
my place in the world.
I thought I'd found it,
but I guess fitting in...
can be a lot more complicated
than it seems.
Dear boy, if you only knew.
Maybe this is
what's supposed to happen.
This is my destiny.
Oh, boo hoo! It's a machine.
Let's get moving, people.
This is wrong and you know it!
The President is right.
It's just a machine.
Bye, Dr. Elefun.
Load the Blue Core
into the Peacekeeper.
I've got a press conference
scheduled in ten minutes.
I'm sorry.
Don't be. I'm sorry
I couldn't have been a better Toby...
Dad.
Is it done?
It's done.
Good man.
When I'm re-elected,
you can have the funding...
to make as many little toys
as you want.
No. If you want the Core,
you'll have to kill me.
Tenma, no! I created the Core.
They're gonna have to kill me.
I think Metro City can learn
to cope without you. Hand it over.
It appears I don't have it.
Tenma!
Open this!
Open that door!
Oh, please.
I said, open that door!
- Never.
- Now!
Blast.
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.
Whoa... what are you doing?
You may not be Toby,
but you're still my son.
Dad.
Now fly! Fly!
No! No!
Arrest them immediately!
I want them shot for treason.
We need the Peacekeeper to get
the Blue Core back.
Don't use the Red Core...
the negative energy.
We can't know how it will behave.
In conflicts between positive
and negative energy...
the negative always prevails.
Look at history! Look at me!
My point exactly.
Turn this thing on.
I won't.
I have fifty reporters
waiting outside! Turn it on!
You don't understand the technology.
Technology! Who understands or
cares about technology?
It's a robot.
It'll do what I say!
Red Core loaded.
You ready to do as you're told?
You ready to rock 'n' roll?
Sir!
Destroy the boy robot and
bring back the Blue Core.
Are you deaf?
I said destroy the boy robot...
and bring back the Blue Core.
Everybody out! Now!
Come on! Move it!
I'm getting word that the President
is slightly delayed.
Is this thing on?
Where are you going? Come back!
Monster, stand down by
order of President Stone.
This is the life.
Smooth sailing.
Whoa!
Sorry!
It's that crazy flying kid again!
I'm a robot, like you.
What are you doing way out here?
We got tired of the rat race.
We dropped out.
We're trying to live more natural,
like real birds.
What's that?
You know how humans are.
New Years, 4th of July, Mothers' Day.
We've got to do something.
Help the humans?
We're robots. It's not our problem.
Forget about them.
What did they ever do for us?
He's right. The rules of robotics
say we gotta help.
A squeezy bottle's gotta do what
a squeezy bottle's gotta do.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
Where are you, robot boy?
Oh, no.
There you are.
What?
Cool!
That has to be Astro.
I don't care if he's a robot.
I miss him.
I hear you.
When the going gets tough,
smart people take a hike.
Bye, kids. What do you want,
an apology?
Nope. Just the car.
I would love to oblige you, but...
I love you guys!
Please, call off the freaking robot!
Gotcha!
This city elected me!
I own it!
It's mine!
Hey! I'm voting for the other guy!
Thank you. Anytime you need me.
What?
I've got machine guns... in my butt?
You gotta be kidding.
Batter up!
Home run!
Astro?
Cora?
Thanks, guys.
Hey, who's driving?
Trashcan, drive faster!
Move over!
Are we going up?
The city's going down!
I have to take care of this.
Astro! No!
Astro!
Look!
Right then, comrades. To arms!
I've got three arms.
Where is he?
Will he be okay?
I hope so.
Hey! Ugly!
Down here!
We demand immediately that
you cease oppressing...
our comrade, Astro.
We may not be able to harm humans...
but nothing says we
can't seriously damage a monster.
Right, comrades?
Look over there!
Where are you, robot boy?
I know you're still alive.
You can't hide from...
Is that all you got?
Come here!
Party's over, kid.
Blue Core obtained.
Toby!
Dad!
I don't understand.
Why didn't it absorb me?
Because it can't.
If the Red and Blue Cores
come together, you'll both die.
Come on, son.
We need to get far away.
Where are you, Astro?
Where's your robot friend?
Where is he?
I've got an election to win
and I want that Core.
Tell me where he's hiding!
Do you hear me? Where is he?
We have to go.
This is it.
This is why I was created.
This is my destiny.
Toby, now!
I'm sorry, but this is who I am.
Onward and upward, Dad.
No!
You're back for more?
Wait! No, no!
No!
- My son.
- Dad.
Get out of me now!
Get out!
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!
No! No! No!
Nuts.
Son.
Seize this girl immediately.
She kicked me!
She can't kick me!
Sir, you're under arrest.
You can't do this to me!
- Astro!
- Astro!
Astro!
Oh, no.
Oh, Astro.
Who was he?
That robot saved the whole city.
Why would he care?
Because that robot had more
humanity than most of us.
Who are you?
I'm a friend of his from the Surface.
You're from the Surface?
Can you fix him?
I'm afraid not.
His Blue Core was unique.
It has died with him.
It's not fair.
All he ever did was help people.
Not just people.
Astro brought Zog back to life.
How?
The blue stuff.
Do you have any of that
blue stuff left?
Do you think you could
spare some for our friend?
Mommy, look!
Dad? Cora? What happened?
Is the Peacekeeper gone?
Yes.
But, but how am I still alive?
Thank you, Zog.
It was no biggie.
I think you've finally found
your place in the world.
You're a hero.
A robot with the heart of a lion.
And everyone finally knows it.
I love happy endings.
- Would you?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Cora!
Cora! Cora!
Mom? Dad?
Where have you been, sweetie?
We searched high and low for you.
Really?
Viva La Roboto-lution!
It looks like all
the interesting stuff is over.
Typical.
Thanks for your help, guys.
It was nothing.
When you think about it,
it really was... nothing.
Are you trying to upset me?
Will you be wanting the car, sir?
I don't want you
to call me "sir" anymore, Orrin.
In fact, take the day off.
Enjoy a day with the robot ladies.
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.
Call me Bill.
I am so freaked out right now.
Take cover! We're under alien attack!
Wait. Are you sure
you're ready for this, Astro?
I was made ready.
