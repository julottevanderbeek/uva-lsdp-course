I'm late
It's nice of you to rush back
Where is everybody?
They've all gone to the funeral
Take along an umbrella
Teacher!
Chen!
Teacher's beyond hearing
Chen!
What's the matter with you?
Take him back for a rest
Have some porridge!
You haven't eaten in two days
Teacher's dead
I know how you feel
But it hurts me
to see you like this
Please, eat something
He still refused to eat?
Talk to him
Why won't you eat?
We all feel sad ever his death
But we must live on
Can ulcers kill a man?
He had ulcers but died of pneumonia
Can that kill a man?
How did he die?
The doctor said
he died of pneumonia
I don't believe it
He was in perfect health
How did he die?
Something must have happened
Calm yourself
We've all been thinking about it
But we mustn't be rash
We are investigation quietly
I must find out the truth
of course
It's our duty too
Many people will come
to pay homage tomorrow
You must be calm
Get some rest
Ho Yuan-chia was a great instructor
He was a champion of the weak
Everyone knows that
I've known him for 30 years
I admire him
for founding Ching Wu School
He traveling all over the country
Using up all his money and energy
He even sacrificed his life
I remember what he used to say
His purpose in founding Ching Wu School
was to strengthen the mind and body
not to aim at winning over others
He was against conflict among schools
He hoped all of us
would be of one heart
to be strong and love the country
We must remember
his words
and develop martial arts accordingly
that every Chinese
will be strong
to serve the community and the country
as well as the future generation
He died soon
after Ching Wu School began
He contributed so much
to martial arts
We have lost a great man
our respects to Master Ho!
Let us have 3 minutes' silence
Please sign your name
We're just in time
You're...?
I'm interpreter for Hungkiu School's
Mr. Hu
I've brought something for you
What is it?
Chief Ling Mu Kuan sent me
Sick Man of East Asia?
What do you mean by that?
It's very simple
We know you're training here
The name is a gift from our master
Are you a Chinese?
Yes, but I'm different from you
Calm down
I won't come if I'm afraid
I know you are all here
I come to challenge you
Well? Who'll step out?
Chia Chi
Step back!
My friends here are eager for a dual
Who will satisfy them?
You have trained hard
but now you dare not speak out
What's happened to your courage?
Hold it. You're...?
I'm Hu, the interpreter
our teacher told us
to train for physical fitness
but not for fights
our school won't fight you
Then you're conceding defeat
If anyone can defeat me,
I'll eat those words
Listen to my Japanese friends
They've made a bet
Well? Anyone care to try?
If the Ching Wu people won't fight
how about the other schools?
Well? You want to; K
Don't be mad, kid
You're all useless sick man of Asia
Chen, hold yourself
Why won't you speak up?
You can all attack together
We shall always oblige
It's too much, too much!
Why won't you let us fight?
I wanted to fight too
But teacher told us not to get in trouble
Whom do you want?
Your chief, Hiroshi Suzuki
He's not here
What is it?
I have something to return to him
You really get the nerve
I'm the worst of Ching Wu students
I want to try your Japanese martial arts
You must be tried of living!
Let's me teach you something
Will fight alone or in group?
Just myself is enough
I have it
Surround him
Hold it!
We Chinese aren't sick man
Eat
You eat paper this time
Next time will be glasses
What is it! Are you mad!
Here we are. Pull over
Ching Wu people dared come to our gate!
What's his name?
I know him, Master
He's Chen, Ho's favorite
Let me ask you this
Could we  people
take it lying down?
As a master of Japanese martial arts
we won't be bullied easily
Right
Bushido is the world's best
Now tell me what to do
We must take revenge!
Right, revenge!
Smash up the Ching Wu School
Don't come back if you fail
What is it?
Go in and take a look
No
Where's the dog?
It belongs to a foreigner
Come here!
Don't you want to get in?
Come on
Act like a dog and I'll get you in
Hurry, the police are coming!
What do you want?
You attacked without warning
What's the purpose?
Why all this rough stuff?
Take that down
Don't fight, stop fighting
Don't insult our teacher
Stop!
Right, let's go!
That's only a little warning
Hand over Chen three days
or we'll have you closed down
and you'll all be arrested
Brother!
Come and help
Teacher, if you had been alive
We wouldn't have been bullied like this
He wants us to hand over Chen
His rashness got us into trouble
Don't blame him
Don't blame it on him
He's back
Salute
You got us into trouble
Where have you been all day?
Did you go to Hungkiu School?
You want to be a hero
Look what happened to us
Why didn't you tell us?
Listen
We build our body
and love our country?
But not fight and make trouble
Then why didn't you tell us?
Many Japanese came
and beat us up
They asked us to hand
you over in three days
What shall we do?
Let him finish what he started
How can you say that?
What then?
Wait to be closed down?
Not only that
We'll all be arrested
Think!
We must not deliver him to them
and we must protect all of us too
We can't surrender him
or he'll be killed for sure
There's only one way
Leave Shanghai
Right
You must leave Shanghai
Not me
Why not?
I don't want to get
you into trouble
We all understand
You must think for yourself too
I'm not leaving
You'd better leave
If they can't find you
despite Japanese influence
They can't do anything without proof
I didn't mean
what I just said
We're brothers
I can't let you die
You don't want to leave now
Do you think staying is a brave thing?
None of us is afraid to trouble
Why don't you listen to our advise?
Go
We won't blame you
Go, go
We won't blame you
Have you forgotten
What teacher always said?
You know the principle of our school
His death increases our burden
Think of the school if not yourself
Why sacrifice needlessly
As you elder
I order you to go
Buy him a train ticket for tomorrow
It's late, you'd better sleep
Is everything packed?
Yes
I came back to marry you
but look what's happened
I don't care much for ceremony
We can return to Shanghai some other day
We can have great fun then
Friends suffer because of me
Nobody is blaming you
It's the first train
Go to sleep
I must stay with Teacher tonight
You go to sleep first
Did anyone see you?
No. They're all asleep
Got it?
Yes. Mr. Wu told us to get away
If they found out Ho died of this
We'd be in deep trouble
Why does Mr. Wu want us to leave?
He said the job's done
There's no point tarrying
What should we do?
You're returning home tomorrow
I'll resign
And we'll go together
You're Japanese?
Yes
I came to kill Ho Yuan-chia
How could you
say such words?
Why not?
I'm not afraid of your Fist of Fury
You're Ho's favorite pupil
I must test your mettle
Feng, come out here
Why did you kill Teacher?
Why did you kill Teacher?
Why did you kill Teacher?
Teacher was killed by
poison in the biscuit
I'll all find out the murderer
and make revenge
Captain! Captain!
Big Brother
Where is Big Brother?
What's it?
What's going go? Where is Big Brother?
Two of them...
Hung on a pole
I saw it myself
They're out there
What is it?
I just bought my train ticket
I saw two men hung on a lamppost
They are Feng and cook Tien
Are you sure?
Yes
Feng and the cook
There's absolutely no mistake
Let's go and have a look
What is it?
Feng and Tien are in trouble
It is Feng!
Let's go back and discuss things
Get transportation
The two men; s faces
were all cut up
Who could it be?
Will our Ching Wu
School be involved?
No
Since we don't know who did it
Not really
But they belonged to the school
So what?
We didn't kill them
Here's International Settlement
I see troubles
We must find the killer
Chen did it
Chen?
Who else?
He left a note for me, saying
Teacher died of poisoning
I wonder where he could have gone
Hiding doesn't help
He always acts as he pleases
Why didn't he tell us?
We must find him
How? Shanghai is so big
He does not know Shanghai well
organize a search!
We must find him out
We'll settle this when he returns
Who's there?
It's me!
I thought you'd be here
Hiding is useless
Come an discuss it
I won't
Nobody knows about your part yet
Why hide and suffer?
Let's go back and find a way
I'm not hiding
I don't want you involved
What are you going to do then?
I've made my plans
What are you going to do then?
Wort you tell even me?
We grew up together
We; ve confided to each other
Why have you changed?
I haven't changed
Then why won't you tell me?
You must know how concerned I am
I love you as I used to
I believe you
Then don't ask questions
Remember the many plans we had
I do
We hoped to continue
Teacher's cause
and to have a happy family
Two children, a boy and a girl
Everyday you'd teach boxing
and I'd do the housework
I'd come and fetch you
and bring the kids
home from school
Can such a dream come true?
I hope so
If you haven't changed,
this may happen
You mustn't think that way
Do you really love me so much?
Next to Teacher,
you mean most to me
Really?
Will you tell me your plans now?
Why won't you speak?
Trust me
I'll take you away
Where to?
A place where our dream
will come true
Do you know any Hu?
Hu?
He's connected
with Teacher's death
Wasn't that interpreter
named Hu?
Could he be the one?
Something terrible has happened!
Come in
What is it?
Look at the papers
Mr. Yoshida's brother
and Feng are dead,
they're strung up
I know. Sit down
My brother became
Ching Wu School's cook
to find about the Fist of Fury
Now he's been killed
You must avenge him, Master
of course. They killed him
We'll kill them all!
I'll assemble the men
Wait! If we do that
It's connect us to Ho's death
What do you propose to us?
I have an idea
Let's hear it
We'll use pressure on the police
to force them
to hand over Chen
or close the school
and arrest everyone
Chinese are very loyalty
Chen won't let that happen
He'll surrender himself
When we have Chen
We can do whatever
we want with him
He'll be helpless
How does it sound to you?
You're Japan's best friend
I've always been
loyal to the Empire
I do my best until I die
Go ahead with it immediately
In respect for Master Ho
We've been lenient with your people
But you are causing
much trouble
Why did you raid
Hungkiu School?
We haven't made
any trouble for you
They came and
beat us all up
We really started nothing
You must have
provoked them
If they hadn't brought,
this first...
And...
How did your Feng and Tien die?
Do you know?
No, we don't
We really don't
We don't know
It's no simple affair
The Japanese are powerful here
You're asking for trouble
I've been kind to you
But I have my duty
to perform
Where is Chen?
He hasn't returned
Know where he is?
No
We're looking for him too
You must not hold back on me
My patience is limited
We don't know
We're looking for him
We don't want to be involved
Let me told you
The Japanese Consulate
has demanded action
This is no joke
Hand him over in two days
or I'll have to be tough
Let's go!
Japan is great!
Even its dancing is superb
Now I'm escape from Russia. Im your man
Don't worry,
leave things to me
Get out?
What happened?
Mr. Petrov is head of the
Russian Hampers
A good fighter and
a friend of our master
He has some trouble
and is thus visiting
Under our master's wings
You're safe
Drink, Mr. Petrov
Three glasses
Three? All right
Three cups
I'm drunk. Excuse me
No, three more cups
Wait, come back
Sit down
If you must go,
then crawl out!
Crawl?
Well?
Sure. I'll do whatever you ask
I'll crawl
Bye
Get up
Where to go?
North Szechuan road,
Yokohama road
Stop, where are you going?
This is a dead end alley
What are you doing?
I want to ask you something
It's you!
I want to ask you something
You needn't ask
I know nothing
I want to ask you something
I know what you want
I didn't do it
Yes...
Someone asked me to do it
Mr. Suzuki told me to
pass the poison to Feng
Feng gave it to Tien
He's Japanese
Spare me
I am just a dog
Have mercy
Why do you pick on me?
Look another man hanged!
Come and look!
Chen first invaded our School
and now killed our interpreter
He don't give face to our Empire
Where's the law in this area?
What are you detectives for?
Please told me
Sir! Aren't you overstating things
I give them two days to deliver Chen
I know what to do if they don't
What can you do?
You're Chinese
You help your own kind
I don't care about nationality
We policeman
have to be reasonable
I have no intention of being reasonable
Chen is a killer
Find him
You can say that, sir
But this is not our procedure
Hu was murdered
but there's no proof
We can't say Chen did it
Proof or no proof
I want him!
Or I'll report to the consulate!
You're making it difficult for us
Then I'll take over
this matter myself
I have ways of handing this
All right, I'll do my best
They're gone
They won't get anywhere
Chinese are Chinese, after all
We'll report to
the consulate first
and then catch him
Newspaper
They're forcing me to deliver Chen
How can I find him
in this big city?
Forget it
We'll go to Ching Wu School
Things are getting worse
Chen has killed
a Japanese interpreter
But he's taking on us too
I'm a policeman
What would you do in my place?
We really can't find him
What are we to do?
Everyone knows you're a fair man
We wouldn't care lie to you
We don't know where he's hiding
We've all
been around
You must hand him out
Don't you know the
Japanese can be tough
If they close down your school
and arrest you
you'll find it really tough
If you arrested us now
We still couldn't
tell as we don't know
I've make things clear anyway
There's one more day left
Please hand him out
The Japanese aren't kids
Don't blame me
for taking you in
It's really serious
What are we to do?
Let's stop looking for Chen
If we find him,
we're sending him to dead
They won't dare touch us
So many are suffering
because of him
Let's go to jail
if we must
Captain!
I want to talk to you
What is it?
If they really can't find Chen
Will it cause the
school much trouble?
Yes, Japanese is
influential in Shanghai
They very well may close down the School
What if they found Chen?
He'll surely be killed
How can we let them found him out?
I wonder where
he's hiding
We must find him
and tell him to escape
I...
You what?
You know where he is?
It is a matter of life or death
If you know,
don't be silent
I know where he is at night
Where is he now?
I'm from the
telephone company
What took you so long?
I just got my orders
Come with me!
There
Don't just stand there,
hurry up!
There's another one inside
Wait here
The telephone man is here
Master, it's the telephone man
Come in!
Tell him to come in
Come here
Chief, it's the telephone man
Go on
I am dying to find Chen
and see just how good he is
It's not only his Fist of Fury
He moves like lightning
I think we need not to fight
We'll concentrate
on Ching Wu School
Wait!
Okay
What do you suggest?
Kill all of them in one stroke
How about the consequences?
We're the International Settlement
As long as we
leave no evidence
Nobody can prove a thing
Send someone tonight
Do a clean job
Yes, sir!
Why isn't he here?
Look around
Chen!
I wonder where
he could have gone?
Let's wait for him
Where could he be?
I wonder
Won ton noodle
I'm here to avenge my teacher
It's none of your business
Get out!
Scram!
Scram!
Hold it!
Who are you?
I'm Chen
I want your master
Chen?
Let me take care of him.
Li-erh!
Yao Chang!
What happened?
Who did it?
Japanese
What bout the others?
Any survivors?
Everyone...
Yao Chang!
He might yet pull through
Help those who have a chance
We'll go upstairs and see
If there are any survivors
None, Captain
I'm unworthy of Teacher!
I'm unworthy of Teacher!
They died so horribly
What are we going to do?
Our inaction was a mistake
Chen was right
Japanese
I'm from the consulate
You dared kill
at the judo hall
It's really too much!
I don't want this
to get out of hands
I'll hand over
the man to you
You're Chinese
I don't trust you
I must go in
All right, just you
Keep guard here
Admit no one
What's up?
The Japanese did it
The Japanese?
Watch your tongue
You must not slander people
What proof do you have?
These two survivors
If I wasrt in charge
of Ching Wu School
If not for Ching Wu
School's future
I'd fight you to the end
Stop talking
Go ahead and
file a complaint
I don't care anything
I only want
Chen immediately
He killed many people
in Hungkiu School
The consulate has
asked the police for him
You'll have to
hand over Chen
What?
They killed so many
of us but are free
And nobody knows if Chen
Was the killer
at Hungkiu School
Now you want us
to hand him over
Is that fair?
We Chinese are not
in good standing
You know the situation here
Chen must be delivered!
I don't know where he is
Now, you call the play
Right
Take them away!
You really don't know
where he is?
What if we can't find Chen?
I've been kind to you
Now I cannot help
you any longer
You're taking us all in?
Not only you'll go to prison
but your school will be closed too
Ching Wu School is finished
Do you Japanese
listen to justice?
Isn't there a law?
I'm the law in Shanghai
Don't blame me
Blame it on Chen
Who asked him to
go into hiding?
He should surrender
for your sake
Chen is here!
Now tell the truth
No lies
If I surrender
will you spare
Ching Wu School?
Well?
I can give you
my word of honor
Don't forget,
I'm also a Chinese
I shall pay for the lives I took
Leave Ching Wu School alone
Who says knight errantry is dead?
Who says life is always preferred?
Here goes a true hero
Caring little what lies ahead
