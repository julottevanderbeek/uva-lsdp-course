{y:i}It was good...
{y:i}that you called us.
{y:i}I don't know what happened.
{y:i}We were at the bar...
{y:i}drinking...
{y:i}having fun...
{y:i}I don't even know...
{y:i}how I got here.
Come on. She's been under too long.
{y:i}You're the only one who can help me.
{y:i}Come one... come on.
{y:i}Tell me what I need to know.
{y:i}Come on.
{y:i}They'll kill me.
{y:i}You asked for my help.
{y:i}Come on.
Come on.
{y:i}The contact in Minsk...
The name, pal. Give us the name.
{y:i}Dimitri...
{y:i}Miediev.
{y:i}What now?
{y:i}Now we drink.
Za druziye.
Get rid of that scum.
Come on...
- Did we get it?
- We got it.
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?
No, thank you.
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
No. I prefer the theatre.
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.
Thank you.
{y:i}RECORDING: Good morning, Mr Phelps.
{y:i}The man you're looking
{y:i}at is Alexander Golitsyn,
{y:i}an attaché at our embassy
{y:i}in Prague.
{y:i}He is also a traitor.
{y:i}He has stolen half
{y:i}of a CIA NOC list -
{y:i}a record of all our deep-cover
{y:i}agents in Eastern Europe.
{y:i}For security reasons,
{y:i}the NOC list is divided in two.
{y:i}The portion that Golitsyn
{y:i}already has contains code names,
{y:i}but it is useless without its mate,
{y:i}which matches the code names
{y:i}with their true names.
{y:i}It is this half which Golitsyn
{y:i}plans to steal from the embassy
{y:i}during a reception tomorrow night.
{y:i}Your mission, Jim,
{y:i}should you choose to accept it,
{y:i}is to obtain photographic proof
{y:i}of the theft,
{y:i}shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
{y:i}and apprehend them both.
{y:i}We've already dispatched a team
{y:i}selected from your usual group.
{y:i}Sarah Davies is already undercover,
{y:i}Jack Harmon can hack
{y:i}into any security system,
{y:i}Hannah Williams
{y:i}will handle surveillance,
{y:i}your wife Claire
{y:i}will cover transport...
{y:i}and Ethan Hunt
{y:i}will be your point man as usual.
{y:i}He will rendezvous in Prague
{y:i}at a safe house of your choosing.
{y:i}As always, should any member
{y:i}of IM Force be caught or killed
{y:i}the secretary will disavow
{y:i}all knowledge of your actions.
{y:i}This tape will self-destruct
{y:i}in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.
A very straightforward objective:
we photograph Golitsyn
stealing the NOC list,
follow him to his buyer,
apprehend both of them.
Now here's the plot.
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character during a party.
Hide in plain sight -
highest possible profile.
- Are you game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.
Sarah, you're at the party already
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.
I have nothing to wear.
Well, you'll work it out.
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him to Hannah.
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.
Stay on him.
No problem.
- Jack.
- Yeah?
Fingerprint security.
There's access through
the elevator shaft here.
- So I'm not wearing my tux?
- Open, close, get out.
Zero residual presence.
Claire, you'll cover outside
in the vehicle.
Hannah will join you
as Golitsyn goes exterior.
- Stay on him from there.
- OK.
Anything goes wrong, I call abort -
everybody walk away, immediately.
Regroup here at 4am. That's 0400.
Any questions?
Yeah. Can we get a cappuccino
machine? What do you call this?
JACK: I call it cruel and unusual.
CLAIRE: I made that coffee.
Exactly. It's even worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev.
Take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- You, too, Ethan.
- On one of your cushy assignments?
- Where this time? The Plaza?
Drake Hotel, Chicago.
ALL: Ooh!
JACK: Cushy! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.
- Fat expense account.
- He's getting soft.
- Yeah, look at him.
OK, listen. If that list
gets out into the open,
the names of our agents in Eastern
Europe go to the highest bidders -
Third World terrorists,
arms dealers, drug lords,
anybody who'd love to get rid
of long-term coverts like us.
If they're exposed,
they'll be executed.
So, I'll run the show from here.
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.
There's a camera
built right into the bridge.
Whatever you see,
it sees and transmits back here.
- See? Can you hear me?
- Of course I can hear you.
No, in your...
oh, you need an earpiece.
Oh.
You have lovely eyes.
Can you hear me now?
Loud and clear.
If he has a car waiting and rolls,
stay with him no matter what.
You should take the afternoon,
drive the streets around this quarter.
- They're confusing.
- What do you think I've been doing?
We're using Waltzer?
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?
Not this week.
This week, he's fishing at the
Oughterard Slough in County Kildare
with one of our best Irish guides.
Yup. And he won't be back
any time soon.
{y:i}MONITOR: ..irrelevant at best,
{y:i}or unconstitutional at worst.
{y:i}With respect, Senator, it sounds
{y:i}as if you want the kind of charge
{y:i}that Senator Frank Church
{y:i}led in the 1970s
{y:i}and to destroy the intelligence
{y:i}capability of this country.
{y:i}I want to know
{y:i}who these people are
{y:i}and how they're spending
{y:i}taxpayers' money.
{y:i}We were living in a democracy
{y:i}the last time I checked.
Stick of gum, right?
No?
No. Red light, green light.
You come up against
a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together -
Hasta lasagne,
don't get any on ya.
You'll have about five seconds.
Just don't chew it.
Ethan, Jack's inside. Let's go.
{y:i}Senator. I'm Rand Housman,
{y:i}the Ambassador's aide.
{y:i}- Hello, Mr Housman.
{y:i}- How was the opera?
Uh, it was boring.
Let me steer you
through this reception line.
{y:i}- How do you do, Senator?
{y:i}- Mrs Reed.
Windows open by 2300.
Petr Brandl, the Mayor of Prague,
and Mrs Brandl.
Oh! I bet you don't remember me,
do you?
Of course. How are you, Miss Norman?
He's in pocket, on the stairway.
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.
Hannah...
{y:i}JIM: Pull the shade.
{y:i}JIM: Sarah,
{y:i}mark the package and go to two.
Your advance team mentioned
you'd like a tour.
I've set one up.
Excuse me. This way.
Jesus!
Oh, great.
SARAH:
..which leads to the denied area,
the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.
Governor's in position now.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance...
This place is like...excuse me.
I'm sorry. It's here somewhere.
Sergeant, why are you not
in uniform this evening?
{y:i}Uh, we've been ordered to wear
{y:i}civilian clothes this evening, sir.
Be right back.
Senator, is anyone
on your staff named Jack?
Jack? Uh, we did have a Jack.
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall -
constantly late
and behind in his work.
{y:i}We were forced to tie him
{y:i}behind a stallion
{y:i}and drag him around for a few days.
Relax your crack. I'm working on it.
Sorry, sir.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.
Thank you. Ah.
That date with Sarah
is definitely off.
Higher.
He's heading to the denied area.
Get moving, Ethan.
He's rolling to you.
Jack.
Jack, we're in position here.
{y:i}ETHAN: Jack.
I didn't touch it.
- Where's my coat?
- Jack, open the doors.
He's in the box, Ethan.
- OK. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.
I'm opening the doors. Go under.
Go!
He's got it.
All right.
Saved your ass again, Jack.
{y:i}JACK: Give me a break, pops.
Such a nice ass.
And a lonely ass.
Transport in five minutes.
Yes, indeed.
Jack, we're in position. Open
the doors and let the package roll.
Roger that. Opening doors now.
Stairway, you're wrapped.
{y:i}ETHAN: Go to transport.
Hey.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing!
I don't have control, Jack.
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.
Cut the power. Jack?
Jack?
ETHAN: Jack?
Jack?
Jack?
{y:i}ETHAN: Jack, do you copy? Jack?
Man down, Ethan. Man down.
{y:i}JIM: Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.
The package is in the open.
Jim.
{y:i}- ETHAN: He's in the open.
- En route.
Jim, he's in the open.
Jim, the package is in the open.
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?
No. Abort.
He's out of pocket.
I can't do that.
We're being ambushed, Ethan.
Abort. That's an order.
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
{y:i}JIM: No, damn it! No! I said abort!
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming.
Jim gave an abort. Walk away.
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?
Now, go!
Where are you?
About 200 yards from the bridge.
{y:i}JIM: They're covering this frequency.
Cut all radio communication.
{y:i}JIM: Repeat -
{y:i}cut all radio communication.
{y:i}JIM: Ethan!
{y:i}JIM: Ethan...
Sarah...
Abort. Repeat - abort.
Abort! Do you read me?
Sarah? God!
Claire.
Oh, my God! My God!
Oh, no... Sarah...
{y:i}MAN: Satcom seven.
Central Europe, unsecured.
{y:i}Designator?
Bravo Echo One One.
{y:i}Switching.
{y:i}This is Kittridge.
Go secure.
{y:i}OK. Go ahead.
This is Ethan Hunt.
They're dead.
{y:i}What...who's dead?
My team. My team is dead!
{y:i}Jesus.
Golitsyn's gone.
They knew we were coming, man.
They knew and the disk is gone.
{y:i}- Are you intact?
- It's gone. Do you read me?
- The list is in the open!
{y:i}- I read you.
{y:i}Let's bring you in safely,
{y:i}then we'll worry about that, OK?
{y:i}Were you followed?
I don't think so.
{y:i}Don't think.
{y:i}Be sure. Are you clean?
Yes.
{y:i}OK. Location green, one hour.
{y:i}I'll be there myself.
You're in Prague?
{y:i}One hour.
I, uh...
I can't tell you how,
er...sorry I am.
I know how much Jim in particular
meant to you, Ethan,
personally
as well as professionally.
Yeah.
Here's a passport, visa.
Usual drill.
We'll work exfiltration through
Canada, debrief you at Langley.
Throw the Prague police a bone
or two. Toss them a few suspects.
You follow me?
Yeah, I follow.
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.
You mean, I'VE lost
enough agents for one night.
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yeah. I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents
at the embassy, tonight.
I don't quite follow you.
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.
The drunk Russians
on the embankment at 7, 8 o'clock.
The couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at 9 and 11 .
The waiter standing
behind Hannah at the stairs -
bow tie, 12.00.
The other IMF team.
You're worried about me. Why?
Well, for a little over two years,
we've been spotting
serious blowback in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.
The other day, we decoded a message
on the Internet
from a Czech we know as "Max".
The arms dealer.
That's right.
Max, it seems,
has two unique gifts...
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting
susceptible agents.
This time, he'd gotten
to someone on the inside.
He'd gotten in a position
to buy our NOC list.
An operation he referred to
as Job 314,
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole
was a decoy.
That's correct. The actual list
is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
One of ours.
This whole operation
was a mole hunt.
This whole operation
was a mole hunt.
Yeah.
The mole's deep inside...
and like you said...
you survived.
I want to show you something, Ethan.
Since your father's death,
your family's farm
has been in receivership,
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be an expensive proposition.
So...
why don't we quietly
get out of here and onto a plane?
I understand you're upset.
Kittridge,
you've never seen me upset.
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.
You have bribed, cajoled,
and killed,
and you've done it from the inside.
You want to court the devil, fine.
Do it in hell.
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?
{y:i}KITTRIDGE: The other day,
{y:i}we decoded a message on the Internet
{y:i}from a Czech we know as "Max".
{y:i}He'd got in a position
{y:i}to buy our NOC list.
{y:i}An operation
{y:i}he referred to as Job 314.
Job 314...
Job... Job 314... Job...
Job...
Job 3:14?
Job 3:14?
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Ethan...
what are you doing?
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you...on the bridge...
but you weren't there.
Ethan...
Ethan...
CLAIRE: Ethan?
Don't move.
Ethan...
Ethan, it's OK.
Just calm down.
It's Claire. It's OK.
You were in the car.
No, I wasn't.
I heard on the radio...
Shut up! I saw you.
You were in the car.
No, I got out of the car.
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was...
Don't give me that. I was there.
There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead!
They're dead! They're all dead!
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...
Take off your coat.
Where were you, huh?
- I...
- Huh? Where were you?
I walked away. He said abort.
I just...walked away.
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?
- Did they send you?
- Who's "they"?
- Look, who sent you?
- No one sent me.
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock.
If we abort, we don't return
here until 4.00, 0400, 4am...
If we abort... 4am...
I've been disavowed.
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max,
for the last two years...
to get him our NOC list.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.
Ethan, you're not making any sense.
Whoever the mole is
goes by the name of Job.
I can't find him,
but if he knows I have the NOC list,
he'll find me.
I'm going in and telling Kittridge
you had nothing to do with this.
Claire, if you're not dead,
he's going to assume you're with me.
The message is for Job.
That's right...
and I'm going to answer it.
ETHAN: Excuse me.
Can I trouble you for a match?
Could you remove your hat, please?
ETHAN: Why?
You wish to meet Max?
The price of admission.
ETHAN:
I thought I was going to see Max.
DRIVER:
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
ETHAN:
Then what the hell am I doing here?
DRIVER: Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.
I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.
If Max doesn't like
what you have to say,
you'll be wearing that shroud
indefinitely.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Very well.
Who are you
and what are you doing here?
I need $150,000.
Oh, really?
You...you...
You thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?
Why not? You gave Job 125.
Hmm... the penny drops.
You are not Job.
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.
So you are something of a paradox.
Well, that depends.
On what?
Whether you like a paradox.
I want $150,000 today.
That's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you...
it's worthless.
It's bait...
part of an internal mole hunt.
And how might you know that?
Are you another company man?
Like Job?
Hmm...
We're asking about you.
I'm NOC...
Was... Now disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That is the question
I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.
Even so...
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.
Why should I?
I can deliver the actual NOC list.
The one you have is worthless
and certain to have a homing device
to pinpoint your location.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm...
Boot it up.
In 30 seconds to 10 minutes,
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like rabbits.
It's easy
to say the disk is worthless
when you say I can't look
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.
OK. Use it, but...
I'd suggest you pack first.
Not so good for you, my friend.
I'd say you've got
about two minutes.
Doesn't mean a signal.
Could just be heating up.
Now.
Man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under
until he decides to surface.
We'll involve the local authorities.
Cut off his transportation.
What can we do, Barnes?
Put a guy at the airport? How many
identities do you think Hunt has?
How many times has he slipped past
customs in how many countries?
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
- We taught them, for Christ's sake.
- What do you suggest?
Let's not waste time chasing him.
Let's make him come to us.
Everybody has pressure points,
Barnes.
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.
Gunther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.
Thanks, Max.
Or is it Maxine?
Ha ha. I don't have to tell you
what a comfort anonymity
can be in my profession.
It's like a warm blanket.
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.
What was your deal with Job?
Um...$6 million.
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now,
not just Eastern Europe.
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous. The entire list.
US Treasury certificates
in bearer form, coupons attached,
and one more thing.
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.
Oh.
Max made a deal with you?
I deliver the NOC list,
Max delivers Job.
We've got 75 rounds
for your Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig Sauer.
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor.
Plenty of passports, and...
What?
You said it yourself,
if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Are you sure about this?
Jim was my husband.
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.
We're going to need some help.
We don't have a lot of time,
so they'll have to be local.
What kind of help?
Simple game.
Four players.
Exfil opens the pocket.
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.
LUTHER: Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
In Langley.
In Langley?
LUTHER:
The one in Virginia, Langley?
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?
Is he serious?
Always.
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?
I can fly a helicopter through
the lobby and land inside the vault.
And it would be easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.
What are we downloading?
ETHAN: Information.
What kind?
Profitable.
Payment on delivery.
I don't know. I just don't know.
Well, this doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.
What did they call you,
the Net Ranger?
Phineas Phreak?
The only man alive who actually
hacked Nato Ghostcom.
There was never
any physical evidence
that I had anything
to do with that...with that...
that exceptional piece of work.
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
You're all kidding yourselves.
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU 3s...
Krieger can get it, right?
May take a little time.
ETHAN: "A little time"?
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.
LUTHER: Thinking-machine laptops.
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes
with the artificial intelligence
risk chip.
And, uh... I get to keep
the equipment when we're done.
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.
Look, uh...
I just can't hack my way inside.
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.
It's in what we call
the stand alone,
which means I'll have to be
physically at the terminal.
Relax, Luther.
It's much worse than you think.
The terminal
is in a black vault lockdown.
ETHAN: The only person
allowed in the room
has to pass through a series
of security checks.
William Donloe.
ETHAN: The first
is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.
This only gets him
into the outer room.
Next, he has to pass
a retinal scan.
And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures
are only deactivated
by a double electronic key card...
which we won't have.
ETHAN: Now, inside the black vault,
there are three systems operating
whenever the technician
is out of the room.
The first is sound sensitive -
anything above a whisper
sets it off.
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.
Even the body heat of an
unauthorised person in the room
will trigger it if the temperature
rises just a single degree.
That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning
coming in through an overhead duct
That vent is guarded
by a laser net.
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm,
and any one of these systems,
if set off, will activate
an automatic lockdown.
Now...believe me when I tell you,
gentlemen, all three systems
are state-of-the-art.
And you really think we can do this?
GUARD: We picked up alarms
in Sectors 3, 7, and 12.
{y:i}FIRE FIGHTER:
{y:i}Where's the air conditioning?
{y:i}GUARD: 21.
{y:i}MAN: There's no alarm in Sector 21.
{y:i}FIRE FIGHTER: I got to shut it down.
{y:i}GUARD: Sorry, nobody gets in there.
{y:i}FIRE FIGHTER:
{y:i}You want fire through this building?
{y:i}GUARD: No one goes into any sector
{y:i}where the alarm hasn't gone off,
{y:i}and it hasn't...
{y:i}Wait.
{y:i}GUARD: It's gone off.
Let's move.
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you.
GUARD: 21's through here.
KITTRIDGE:
He's recruiting. For what purpose?
Survival.
Too short-sighted.
This guy initiates. He's proactive.
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what's that noise?
Uh, the fire alarm, Gene.
Do we have to evacuate?
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?
Zero body count.
We'll see.
Hi, there.
One.
Two.
Three.
Toast.
Toast.
{y:i}LUTHER: Check.
Good.
OK, Luther, I'm going in.
Everest, man.
{y:i}You ready to plant the flag?
Damn.
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.
He's rolling to you.
He's at the voiceprint corridor.
William Donloe.
Outer room.
He's coming in the vault.
Come on, move.
DONLOE: Oh...
Oh...
He's in the bathroom.
A-W-9...
{y:i}6-B-6.
Holy Mother of God.
{y:i}The NOC list.
He's at the vault.
Four yellows.
One red.
Get moving.
LUTHER: Toast.
Toast.
Merci.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
It's...for you.
Kittridge.
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops,
you understand?
- It never happened.
- What about him?
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska. Mail him his clothes.
You contacting your buyer?
Ethan?
KRIEGER: Ethan.
Ethan.
Oh...
Excuse me. Mr Hunt.
You're not going
to any meeting without me.
My contact is extremely shy.
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders, do you?
Not while I'm holding this.
Krieger...
You mean this?
That's not the list.
What's the matter?
You've never seen this trick?
Where'd it go?
It's gone.
What?
You.
No.
No?
No, come on.
But not too far.
I know what you're thinking,
Krieger.
You're thinking,
back in the computer room,
I was up here, he was...
he was down there.
Yes, and he was...
he was carrying two disks.
So hard to keep track
of these things.
Where is it?
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?
Try any sleight of hand with
my money, and I'll cut your throat.
{y:i}JACK: You're off on one of your
{y:i}cushy recruiting assignments again?
{y:i}ETHAN: Yeah. Where'd they
{y:i}put you up this time, the Plaza?
{y:i}JIM: Drake Hotel, Chicago.
CLAIRE: I'm so sorry.
Krieger was my call.
I'm sorry, Ethan.
We did what we had to do.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Krieger did have the NOC list?
- You hold on to it.
- What makes you trust me?
Because if you knew about it,
you never would have done it.
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.
Exactly. That's your job
tomorrow on the train.
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.
What is the range of this thing?
It's hard to tell.
We're going to have to be close.
CLAIRE:
Ethan, I need to talk to you.
{y:i}TV: The unlikely setting -
{y:i}a farm in the heartland of America,
{y:i}the state of Wisconsin,
{y:i}where Federal Agents claim
{y:i}to have found the brains
{y:i}behind an international drug ring.
{y:i}The operation was masterminded
{y:i}by Margaret Ethan Hunt
{y:i}and her brother-in-law Donald Hunt.
{y:i}They were arrested this morning
{y:i}by drug enforcement officers
{y:i}in a major sting operation
{y:i}designed to expose
{y:i}the illegal manufacture
{y:i}of the drug Methcathinone,
{y:i}known as Cat.
{y:i}- SECOND MAN: What we have here...
- Kittridge.
Kittridge.
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.
It's Hunt. What do you
need for a pinpoint?
You've been watching
a little TV, have you?
Hauling mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.
TECHNICIAN: He's in England.
Get MI5.
Ethan, I want to assure you
that my first order of business
after you come in
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped
and eliminated completely
from their files.
If you, uh, if you come in now,
{y:i}we can plea down
{y:i}the charges against you as well.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
Certainly, Ethan.
If you're dealing with someone
{y:i}who's crushed, stabbed,
shot, and detonated
{y:i}five members of his own IMF team...
how devastated do you think he'll be
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
to the county courthouse?
{y:i}I don't know, Ethan.
{y:i}Why don't you tell me?
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.
He wanted us to know
he was in London.
You're a hard man to catch up with.
The next day I managed
to drag myself to the safe house.
I must have just missed you.
Anyway, I checked our aliases.
Then you followed us to the States.
But you left
before I could get there.
Smaller countries don't computerise
customs records.
So I watched Europe.
Once you turned up
in England, it was easy.
You knew I liked the rentals
at Liverpool Street.
Hey, I showed them to you.
I remember.
Who do you think
you're kidding here?
A doctor's got to see you.
You can't sit up straight.
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well.
Sit down. Sit down.
It's not important.
Ethan...
I saw who shot me.
I saw the mole.
It was Kittridge.
Kittridge.
Kittridge, Ethan.
Kittridge is the mole.
My God, of course. You're right.
He was at the embassy that night.
First, he took out Jack
at the elevator.
He shot you on the bridge.
JIM: Ethan!
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.
How did he do Hannah?
No. No. He could have
done Hannah himself.
Why, Jim?
Why?
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable. No more cold war.
No more secrets you keep
from everyone but yourself.
Operations - you answer
to no one but yourself.
And then one day you wake up.
The President is running the country
without your permission.
The son of a bitch. How dare he?
Then you realise it's over.
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.
Kittridge...
We'll go after the no-good
son of a bitch big time.
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.
What's going to make him do that?
What he didn't get in Prague -
the NOC list.
Whoa.
Jesus, Ethan.
Good for you. Phew.
I'm meeting tomorrow on the TGV,
en route to Paris.
Tight security. No guns.
A real plus.
If I supposedly deliver
the NOC list to Max,
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.
Krieger will have helicopter
transport waiting in Paris.
Jim?
I was in a café
waiting for you, Ethan.
And there she was...
standing in the rain...
alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going,
to get the job done.
She can't know about me, Ethan.
No one can until this is over.
You're probably right.
There's too much at stake.
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.
I'll call you from Paris.
JIM: You got it.
What happened?
I sent the message to Max.
We're on for tomorrow.
OK.
Come here.
Sir.
What's this?
Incoming, sir, for you.
X-ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.
Gene?
How long to the London Terminus?
You've got 10 minutes. Move!
Yes?
{y:i}ETHAN: Give me Max.
It's him.
This was not what we discussed.
{y:i}My apologies, Max.
{y:i}It couldn't be helped.
{y:i}There's a piece of black cloth
{y:i}under your seat.
{y:i}Tear it away,
{y:i}and you'll find the disk.
Dear boy...
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.
{y:i}Not as long as you tell me
{y:i}where the money is.
The mere possibility
is worth 10 million.
Baggage car, rack three.
Silver briefcase, combination 314.
{y:i}What about Job?
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money,
he'll find you.
What's the matter?
It's not transmitting.
Try it, try it again!
Damn it, I've got to get this
through before we hit the Channel.
MAX: What's the problem?
MATHIAS: Connection denied.
MAX: I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?
MATHIAS: I always do.
MAX: Don't give me that.
Run it through from the top.
KITTRIDGE: This is bullshit.
We don't even know what Max looks like.
We don't need to.
If he's got that list, he's going
to check it. And that means laptops.
Excuse me, sir.
Your telephone?
PASSENGERS WITH MOBILES: Hello?
PASSENGER: I can't hear anything.
WAITER: Is everything all right?
The battery is gone.
It's working.
He's in the baggage car.
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
{y:i}ETHAN: I'm right behind you.
{y:i}The money's in the baggage car.
{y:i}I'll meet you there.
Barnes?
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim...
Is it such a good idea to kill him?
Kittridge is here.
We take the money...
Ethan takes the blame.
No one else has seen you alive.
No one will believe him.
Of course...
I'm very sorry to hear
you say that, Claire.
Ethan...
JIM: Yes.
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?
You knew about Jim?
Of course.
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?
Before or after
I showed up in London?
Before London.
But after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.
Ethan...
if you knew about Jim, why...
Why the masquerade?
JIM: Why take the risk?
Well, Claire...
you've asked the question.
And you are the answer.
I knew about Jim.
JIM: But he didn't know about you.
In all fairness, Ethan,
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife", Ethan.
Let's get the money and get out.
Yes, let's get the money.
Ethan...the money.
Give her the money.
You've earned it.
All ten million.
ETHAN: You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.
Oh?
What's that?
Good morning, Mr Phelps.
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.
You son of a bitch.
It's over, Jim.
Don't... Don't, Jim.
"Don't, Jim"?
Aah!
Damn!
No, it's in the tunnel!
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!
Accelerate! Accelerate!
Red light!
Green light!
I think this is what
you're looking for.
Hello, Max.
My lawyers are going to have
a field day with this.
Entrapment,
jurisdictional conflict...
Well, maybe we'll just leave
the courts out of this one.
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.
{y:i}In a freak accident, a helicopter lost altitude,
{y:i}veered into a tunnel,
{y:i}and collided with a train
{y:i}on its way from London to Paris.
{y:i}The pilot was killed,
{y:i}but no one on the train was hurt.
{y:i}Authorities have attributed the
{y:i}accident to instrument failure...
LUTHER:
Reach your folks? How do they feel?
About what?
The apology
from the Justice Department,
VIP treatment,
you know, the whole 9 yards.
Well, my mom was a little confused
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.
Cheers.
To you, Luther.
For being off the disavowed list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.
Why don't you come back with me?
I just...l just don't know
why I'd be doing it.
Got to go catch my flight.
So how does it feel
to be a solid citizen again?
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss
being disreputable.
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.
Excuse me. Mr Hunt?
Would you like to watch a movie?
Oh, uh... no, thank you.
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?
Aruba, perhaps?
