He's in that passage.
He's over there.
Lay back, he'll come right into us.
What in God's name is that?
Halt!
Get outta here!
Halt!
In the name of the law...
How in the hell do you stop this thing?
I said halt!
Stop!
In here.
Careful mate.
There's a man inside.
Round them up.
Leave one alive to tell the tale.
Kill the rest.
Such treasures.
Treasures...yes.
Some worth more than others.
Bring the scientist with us. Kill any that resist.
Do we have him?
Those are your servants, sir.
What do you want?
The world, Patrick, I want the world.
Are you crazy?
This place is filled with hydrogen gas.
Really!
That's so frightening.
Don't wander off.
Where's Quartermain?
There. That gentleman in the back.
Do I have the pleasure of addressing Allan Quartermain?
Ahhh...Yes you do sir. Indeed, you do.
You're not what I expected.
Well, I presume you're another traveller,
who got it in his head to sample the Dark Continent,
and while you're at it, track down old Allan Quartermain
and have him tell his ventures.
Well...
Well, have a seat, sir.
If you'll fill my glass, Bruce. A double.
I know how to regale you with how
I found King Solomon's mines. I could relate...
It is not your past that interests me.
Ahhhh?
My name is Sanderson Reed.
I'm a representative of Her Majesty's British Government.
The Empire needs you.
But the question is...do I need the Empire?
Perhaps I should toddle off, Allan?
Yes, of course, Nigel. You toddle off.
I'll be toddling.
Nigel is useful for keeping the story seekers at bay.
I'm Quartermain.
The Empire is in peril.
You're probably too young to know,
but the empire is always in some kind of peril.
We need you to lead a team of unique men
like yourself to combat this threat.
Regale me.
There is a great unrest.
Countries set at each other's throats baying for blood.
It's a powder keg.
The trouble of which I speak could set a match to the whole thing...War.
With whom, exactly?
Everyone. A world war!
That notion makes you sweat?
Heavens, man! Doesn't it, you!
This is Africa, dear boy. Sweating is what we do.
Where is your sense of patriotism?
God save the queen!
God save the queen!
That's about as patriotic as we get around here.
But you're Allan Quartermain.
Stories of your exploits have thrilled English boys for decades.
That I know.
And Nigel has done a great job of reminding me.
But, with each past exploit I've lost friends.
White men and black, and much more.
And I am not the man I once was.
Are you Mr. Quartermain?
Yes, indeed, sir.
Wrong Quartermain!
Get down!
They're indestructible!
No, just armor plated.
Automatic blazes...who in God's name has automatic rifles!?
That's unsporting. Probably Belgian.
Wicked waste.
Look out!
Good old Britannia.
Wasn't there another one of these buggers?
Mr. Quartermain.
Bruce. Matilda.
Their friend might have some information.
But, he's so far away.
There. I thought he was.
God, I hate getting older.
Did you mean to just wound him?
Obviously.
Stop him. I need information.
Lucky poison.
You may have no love for the Empire, but I know you love Africa.
A war in Europe will spread to its colonies.
It appears the war has arrived.
Very well, Reed.
I'm in.
Excellent.
Pack for an English summer.
You made good time getting here.
Not as good as Phileas Fogg around the world in 80 days.
Where are we going?
Australia?
And here we are, sir.
I don't like theatrics.
After Africa's felt, London weather
isn't helping your mood as I see.
Identify yourself.
I'm known by many names, Mr. Quartermain.
My underlings call me "Sir".
My superiors call me "M".
"M"?
Just "M".
I must say the delight is mine...
Meeting so notable a recruit to this newest
generation of the league of extraordinary gentlemen.
League of what?
There have been other times when a danger upon the world
has required the services of singular individuals.
Oh, very curious.
This museum is full of the curious.
Allan Quartermain.
Captain Nimo.
I know of Mr. Quartermain.
And I know of you, Captain.
Rumor has it that you are a pirate.
I'd prefer a less provocative title.
I'm sure you would.
Gentlemen. Please.
Nations are striking at nations.
Every attack marked by the use of highly advanced weaponry.
We've discovered all these attacks are through the work of one man,
who calls himself the "Phantom".
Very operatic.
And what's in it for him?
Profit.
Those machines are his creations,
the work of scientists he holds prisoned.
These attacks have every nation
clamoring for the very weapons that it'd sell them.
Then, it's a race for arms.
And millions will perish.
There's one last chance to avert war.
The leaders of Europe are to meet secretly in Venice.
And you believe that this phantom will attack that conference?
If he can fight it.
We need a team to get to Venice and stop him.
This team will consist of 6 members.
You have 4 days.
Four days to get to Venice?
It's impossible.
Let me worry about that.
Well, well, extraordinary gentlemen indeed.
One of them is late.
Parker, chemist.
Oh, chemist? Do we get to blow something up, then?
My eye sight must be worse than I thought.
No, your eye sight's fine.
No games, M.
Some time ago a talented, although misguided, man of science
discovered the means to become invisible.
Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
Well yes, he did, but his process didn't.
You see, I stole it, and here I stand for all to see.
Is this some parlor game?
The ladies. Easy now Allan.
I'm feeling a bit of a draft in my nether regions.
And I must say, it is quite refreshing.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, Gentleman thief.
Now, invisibility would be a boom to my work.
For you can imagine, it was my own doing.
Once you're invisible, it bloody hard to turn back.
He finally caught it.
And they'll provide an antidote.
That is, if I'm a good boy.
And are you a good boy?
Well, I guess you'll find out, won't you?
Am I late?
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.
Please tell me this is Harker's wife...with a sick note.
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.
Gentelmen, Mrs. Willamina Harker.
Mina's prime acquaintance with a reluctant member may prove useful.
I'm waiting to be impressed.
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are still 2 more members to recruit.
The clock has turned, gentlemen.
Kicking out already?
A moment ago was sharing and giggles.
What in God's name is that?
I call it an automobile.
Yes, but what is it?
The future Gentlemen.
The future?
This is my first mate.
Call me Ishmael. Please.
So, how did they get you?
It's none of your business.
You're a little tense, Mr. Q.
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger in the way I do.
And I imagine you with quite a library Mr. Quartermain.
All those books you must've read me by looking at the covers.
I've had women along on past exploits,
and found them to be at best a distraction.
Do I distract you?
My dear girl, I've buried 2 wives and many lovers,
and I'm in no mood for more either.
-You can send them my way ?
-Skinner, shut up.
Should I wait, Captain?
No, bring my lady to me.
This is a charming spot.
Jack, the Ripper lived here!
Good evening
Mr. Dorian Gray?
I am indeed.
We came by way of M.
Um, M for mystery.
Well, I told him what I'm telling you.
I'm not interested.
Dorian.
Mina?
Charming decor.
Ah, you're missing a picture Mr. Gray.
And you don't miss a thing, do you, Mr. Quartermain?
Oh, sometimes.
Scotch anyone?
Please...help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed Mr. Gray.
You take Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Yes, well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
Although I must say I was surprised to see you again.
When our last parting was such sweet sorrow?
Ah, so you're nothing more than an enticement.
Nevertheless, your presence intrigues me.
They say you're indestructible Quartermain.
Well, a witch doctor did bless me once.
I had saved his village.
He said Africa would never allow me to die.
But you're not in Africa now.
No.
I confess some curiosity of what the files say about Mr. Gray.
We, all of us, have a useful trade in this endeavor.
A hunter.
A scientist.
Even Skinner has stealth.
Cheers.
What of you?
I have experience.
Gray and I have met before.
Many years ago at Eaton College.
A lecture no doubt. You're the nation's hero.
Dorian the eagerly listening boy.
Quite the reverse.
It was Gray visiting Eaton. And I was the boy.
What is it?
Gray?
They're not mine.
They're mine.
First meetings usually warrant introductions.
Of course.
I am the phantom.
You are the League of so called extraordinary gentlemen.
Introductions made.
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quartermain, not blind.
Drop the gun.
Your mission is to stop me.
That of course I cannot permit.
So I give to all a special one time invitation.
Join me.
Do you think we'll help start a war that will consume the planet?
While you profit from your arms race?
I cannot deny that fortunes that are made in war.
Imagine the riches a world war will yield.
He's not wrong.
Speak for yourself.
Draw your pistol.
I walk a different path.
Run, James.
Night night.
Dorian.
What are you?
I'm complicated.
Damn.
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Willamina?
Oh, she probably hip deep in some sort of trouble.
Don't be such an alarmist Mr. Q.
And my hips are none of your business.
Shoot. Go on.
I guessed as much that they would do anything to protect you.
Ithink that's your biggest mistake,
thinking that I need them to protect me.
Extraordinary.
Boy, they told me European women had funny ways.
You missed a spot.
Excuse me.
-And you are?
-Special Agent Sawyer.
The American Secret Service.
Then America is aware of the situation?
Well, if war starts in Europe
how long is it going to take to cross the Atlantic?
I followed you.
I knocked out a straggler and I took his place.
Very noble.
But this is a private party and you're not invited.
Actually, Dorian has declined.
So we are one shy of a full deck.
On the contrary, the battle was just the spur I needed.
That and the thrill of a friendship renewed.
Hm.
So you're not needed.
Winchester.
That's right.
It's modified. American style.
American style shooting too.
Well, whatever it takes.
If you like it, I brought two.
You're in.
So, what's the next port of call?
Paris.
Just one last member to recruit.
Capture is more of the word.
And it will be quite a hunt.
You make him sound like some kind of animal.
Of, speaking thus Mrs. Harker, your conduct a moment ago.
Indeed. We were all a quiver of curiosity.
Well...
My husband was Jonathan Harker.
Together with a professor named Van Housin we fought a dangerous evil.
It had a name...Dracula.
He was a Transylvanian.
Hmmmm...European?
One of those radicals newspapers left to report on?
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.
Is vampiric sucking blood a radical behavior?
Ahhh...our transportation is forthcoming.
A boat?
It travels on water if that's what you mean.
And beneath it!
Behold. Nautilus, the sword of the ocean.
Next stop, Paris.
I don't see what we need a big monkey for.
Well, this big monkey has terrorized the louvres for months.
Imagine the mayhem he'll give the enemy, huh.
Missed.
I'm not trying to hit him.
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.
Make him turn left, boy.
If you can't do it with one bullet then don't do it at all.
He's doubled back.
Precisely. Come on.
Look out.
That was naughty.
Thanks.
Eye's open boy.
Can't protect you all the time.
He's afraid.
I can't smell anything.
Perfect. Welcome aboard Mr. Hyde.
This hunt is too dangerous for a woman.
Even for such as you. Leave it to me.
Oh God.
Hello, Dorian.
The great white hunter's bagged his prize.
Or the prize bagged him.
I've got him.
Stay back. If you value your life.
Ow! You scratched me.
Better me than him.
Well, this is nice.
Mr. Hyde, you've done terrible things in England.
So terrible that you fled the country.
And I'm ashamed to say that her majesty's government
is willing to offer you amnesty in return for your services.
You want to go home.
Home. Home is where the heart is, that's what they say.
And I have been missing London so.
Its sorrow is as sweet to me as a rare wine.
I'm yours.
Don't be afraid.
Who says I'm afraid?
You. You stink of fear.
Quite the parlor trick.
You wait till you see my next one.
Dr. Jackyll at your service.
So, the league is set.
So is the date for the conference.
We have three days.
Three days? Can this canoe do that?
You underestimate the nautilus.
You underestimate her greatly.
She's out of your league.
Mina.
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.
Fortune rewards the bold.
If you require any help during the voyage Mrs. Harder, just let me know.
I'm curious how you think you could assist me, Agent Sawyer.
Heavy lifting.
Will that matter, I'm a useful kind of guy.
You're sweet,
And you're young.
Neither traits that I hold in high regard.
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.
Mr. Quartermain,
Mr. Jackyll,
Mr. Skinner.
Captain.
Nimo.
The plans phantom stole from the bank of England.
These are copies.
Da Vinci's blueprints of Venice.
Its foundations and waterways.
So he'll attack the conference by sea.
Easy Allan.
Skinner. I want you dressed at all times,
or it's my foot up your ass.
Dinner is served Mr. Quartermain.
I can offer a jacket if you require.
Oh, thank you, no.
But thank you for your contribution so far.
I may have been overly rude earlier when I called you a pirate.
And I may been overly charitable when I said I wasn't.
But I try to live in the now, where the ghosts of old wrongs do not abide.
What about you?
Oh, I don't believe in ghosts, although I've seen my share.
Your past haunts you.
Vanity, pride, mistakes...
cost me someone dear.
So now you throw yourself in harm's way.
Old tigers sensing the end are the most fierce.
And they go down fighting.
An hour left Captain. That's all I'm saying.
Powder?
You think sabotage?
We ain't that far off course.
Pull out.
Did you want something?
No. I was just wondering why you signed up for all this.
Nimo told me you hate the British Empire.
They called and I answered.
But that ain't all of it, is it?
Pull out.
Sorry I asked.
A few years ago the British approached me with a mission for the queen and country.
That sounds like the morning ride to work for you, I'd imagine.
I signed on without hesitation.
I even took my son along.
I led, my son followed.
He died in my arms.
After that I washed my hands of England, the empire,
the legend of Allan bloody Quartermain.
Now, would you like to learn how to shoot?
I can already.
I saw. Very American.
Firing off bullets and hoping they hit the target.
Sawyer, I'm talking about hitting the ace.
At 900 yards.
Try.
Easy. Easy.
Pull out.
Aim.
That's easy.
Allow for wind, target movement.
Yeah, that's easy too.
This is the part that's not.
You have to feel the shot.
Take your time with it.
You have all the time you need.
All the time in the world.
Take...your...Too soon.
But that was bloody close,
and at 500 yards too.
Again.
Pull out.
Did you teach your son to shot like this?
Quatermane?
That's Kallie, the goddess of death.
If he worships death, can we trust him?
He's not the one I'm worried about.
Mina.
I'm identifying a powder that Nimo found.
Magnesium phosphorous.
Photographers use it to create a flash.
A camera perhaps.
It appears as though someone wishes to capture the vessel's secrets.
I was surprised you ultimately joined the league.
I mean to undo the flaws of my character.
I want to face my demons.
And what do you know of demons?
Do you recall a space on the wall of my house?
A picture was missing.
Although the picture is my portrait,
I doubt you would recognize the face upon it.
Every year that passes, my portrait ages instead of me.
When did you last see it?
I dare not look upon it myself.
The magic of the painting would be undone.
Nightcap?
I'm not much of a drinker.
Just a small one then.
How clumsy of me.
We don't want blood everywhere. Do we?
No...not the blood.
Yes, Henry,
look but don't touch.
Huh huh...that's your way.
Just shut up!
I won't trip again.
Tripped?
You've known what it was about each time you drank the formula.
Liar. I'm a good man. A good man.
Who's lying now?
You want it even more than you want her.
No!
You can't shut me up forever.
Drink the elixir!
No!
She barely even looks at you.
Be quiet.
She looked at me.
Contain your evil, doctor.
I'll not have the brute free upon my ship.
Must I take drastic steps?
I am in control.
I very much doubt it.
Your talk is well and good, sir,
but your past is far from laudable.
Let me out.
If I didn't know better I'd swear I already had.
One of the vials is missing.
Oh God.
So it's clear,
with Da Vinci's blueprints and enough explosives
he could set a bomb that would blow Venice's foundations to rubble.
He's going to sink the whole city.
Yes, and spark off a world war.
I'm afraid that is not the sum of the problems.
Skinner...he's taken a vile of my formula.
Are you sure?
Who else?
You've seen the way the sneaky bloke operates.
It's the carnival.
My God. We must locate that bomb.
We can go no further, Captain.
All ahead...stop.
Deploy the divers beneath the city.
The explosives must be found.
Aye aye sir.
This bomb, it could be anywhere.
What about Skinner?
I'd be alert for his treachery.
Bloody carnival.
God, I feared the worst.
Sorry, you still have...
The buildings are falling like dominoes.
We're too late.
There must be more than one bomb.
Nimo.
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.
Yes. Get ahead of the raps and take out one key building.
We can interrupt the chain of destruction.
With a beacon we can place the exact coordinates.
I can launch a rocket and take out the domino effect.
That's ridiculous.
We'd never get there in time.
That leaves no room for error.
But I tell you it could work.
What are you talking about. Gray's right.
I'm an mortal sir, not a gazelle. How can we outrun this!
Care for a spin?
Come on Jackyll, get in.
I need coordinates.
Can you track this thing?
Of course.
Good, then the car will be your target.
Launch when you see the flare.
Right.
Jackyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
No. Hyde will never use me again.
Then what good are you?
Straight ahead, then turn left.
No, no. Take a right after the canal port.
We have to turn left to get ahead of the dominoes.
Snipers.
Duck.
Damn, Skinner, he must've told them we were coming.
Dorian.
Can't get a clear shot.
Take the wheel.
Sit down, you buffoon.
I don't know how to drive this bloody thing.
Sit down.
Ok, got it.
Save your bullets, these men are mine.
Did you see that?
Did you see what she just did?
It's a gauntlet!
The vampire lady has us covered.
The collapse has reached the carnival captain.
Time's running out.
Tune the prism to the car's frequency.
The rockets must be ready to launch.
Aye aye captain.
Come on, Sawyer, come on.
Captain, we must pull out.
No, we stay and do our job.
Remember the flare.
I'm off.
What?
Don't forget, you're the target.
