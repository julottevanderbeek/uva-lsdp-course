Aalst, Belgium - end 19th century
Pick up those bobbins!
Put that basket away!
Watch out!
What's this?
Go on, pick it up.
Pick that up!
Work, or I don't need you.
Get out, son of a bitch!
And you, 20 centimes fine!
I didn't do anything!
Professor Daens,
is it true that you want to leave
the college of Dendermonde?
I've had nine beautiful years,
Monseigneur. That's enough.
You've had nine years of troubles
with everybody.
Them with me, maybe.
I won't deny that.
Anyhow,
now I want to go to Aalst.
I have a spot as a junior priest
in Drongen.
You're expected there tomorrow.
You know very well that I've had
real problems in Drongen.
and indeed, with everybody.
- I remember, because you still have.
I don't think I'm welcome there.
You can hold your own.
And you're a difficult man.
Shouldn't you consider in peace
what you actually want?
You're not happy anywhere!
You're right, Monseigneur. That's
why I'm leaving for Aalst tomorrow.
If you really need me,
you can find me there.
Please, Lord,
free us from Daens.
In the name of the father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen!
May St. Ursula protect our factory
in these troubled times.
Hail Mary, Mother of God.
Lord be with you,
blessed above all women
and blessed is your Son Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, now and forever. Amen.
Go away, there! Get out!
There, there are more!
There's Nini!
Those coals are ours. Get out!
You don't need coals.
Aalst!.... Two-minute stop!
Two-minute stop.
And? Where are these socialists?
All this panic for nothing!
Well, well! Father Daens!
Adolf...What a surprise!
- Am I not welcome?
Or is Aalst yours only now?
- No, no.
But the bishop did not inform us
Where do I send this, Father?
-to my brother's, printer Daens.
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!
Please sirs, for you it's free!
Don't hit me!
According to Belgian law, I can...
-I'm the law here
you can nothing. Back to Ghent!
Guys, dirty Lisette has potatoes.
Lisette!
Gee, what a potato.
-My potatoes!
There's another fat one.
Thieves!
Let's go, fellows. Run!
My potatoes, thieves!
Bunch of bastards!
What are you doing?
This is no cemetery or dunghill.
Why are you bringing this here?
-Throw them away at your place.
Throw it away!
I'm fed up with the child.
Look there!
Father, do you agree with him?
Dumping his corpses here.
What can I do with it?
It's not up to me to bury her.
Besides, I need my cart.
I've got work to do.
What happened?
-Frozen to death, Father. Feel it.
It's the same every day.
Farmers find them and bring them
here instead of burying them.
Does anybody know her?
Everyone knows her, Father.
Nini, with the wet cherry.
So, potato-thief, maybe you also
know where her parents are?
Yes, over there somewhere.
Around the corner, under the bar.
Whose arse is this.
Whose arse is that.
Whose arse may this well be.
But man, this is the coal bag.
That coal bag belongs to me...
Fellows, they've released a crow!
Cover your bum, your man is here!
Gust! That's a priest!
Doesn't have to look for favours
around here. Do you Father,
or are you looking for the devil?
I'm looking for Nini's parents.
-Hot Nini, with the wet cherry?
Gust!
Over there, Father.
Listen, if you're here
to lecture us, don't bother!
And certainly not about that whore.
It's everyone for himself here
And our poor-box is empty.
But...
do you know what happened to her?
Did you see her?
-She's banged up.
We know. And leave my man alone.
None of your business!
Indeed.
- This is the one.
Red swine, I didn't do anything.
You haven't either, did you, Jef?
She liked it.
She came to ask for it herself.
Here.
Don't let them bury her like a dog.
Buy her a coffin.
Hey, more thieves!
-Uncle Adolf!
Are those boxes for us?
-Of course! Choose, you skunks!
Adolf...
gee! It's been a long time!
Can I move in here?
-Run off again?
I hate priests,
the college makes me sick.
I could teach you in private
and finally pay you back.
Don't be silly. you're welcome!
Peter will be glad!
I hear you're still kind to your readers.
-Adolf!
What a surprise!
Travelling through?
-No, I'm staying!
Does your bishop allow this?
Here, competition.
You trust yourself on the streets
with such a newspaper?
Where did you get it?
A socialist's gift at the station.
Any room for me on the front page?
- If you want...
ENOUGH DEAD CHILDREN IN AALST
Did you read this, Borremans?
A catholic paper against our ideas
agitating the workers against us.
You must talk about it to Woeste.
-You do it. There he is.
Have you read it Mr. Chairman?
-I'm aware, my friends.
I will bring reason to
that little printer.
It's going too far.
Aalst is getting more dangerous by the day.
They insult and loot us
and threaten our women.
They terrorise the country
and this newspaper.
Don't exaggerate, Druwé.
-Do I?
Let's not waste our time.
That paper I can handle.
These workers shouldn't bite the
hands that feed them.
The church should take care of that.
As an employer you take care of
their of salvation too.
You don't know these workers.
They have the same worries
as us directors.
How many factories will
survive the crisis in Aalst?
If the government won't subsidize
me, I will close down.
There will be no subvention.
-But you promised...
My colleagues in the government
don't want state intervention.
The recommend the English method.
Limit production costs to
enable competition.
Lower the wages?
That's impossible.
It's not, I pay them 1.60 franc
for 14 hours work.
Cumont pays 2 franc for 11 hours.
And he's still complaining,
he's going to go down.
If we all draw the line, they
even will accept 1.40 franc.
While a loaf of bread costs 60 centimes
and a bag of coal 1,50?
Pay them with potatoes.
Why not?
The money goes to booze anyway.
They won't survive...
They also won't survive
if the factories closes
Poverty is not the problem.
-I agree with that.
But to me it's dangerous
to lower the wages now.
People are already upset.
We could implement the Scottish system.
Three workers to four machines.
And if we only let the women work
we safe half.
You can't mean that?
It's an interesting idea.
-The Scots still do it as well.
Three female worker to four machines.
Are there not enough accidents
already?
How many fatal accidents have you got?
And you, Antoine? And you lot?
Safe us your demagogy.
In every war there will be casualties.
You are monsters. The lot of you.
We liberals stand up for our workers
who live in total poverty.
No aid from you and Aalst loses
its industry and you your constituents.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Woeste and you gentlemen...
...but now it's time
to relax.
What a charming thought.
-Don't hide, Junior.
Say hello to Mr. Woeste.
Hello, Junior.
Work hard and you be as big and
important as your dad.
Who is teaching you?
We are looking, They have recommend
Father Daens to us.
The brother of that printer.
Let's hope he thinks differently.
It doesn't say a-e, but e, consul-e
The root always stays the same.
Carry on.
Again, carry on.
-Latin bores me, Father.
Don't recite it like a parrot,
without knowing what you say.
What is written there?
-Consul.
Do you know what that is
-No.
Only women and children. Go away.
Let those children pass.
Out, Scholliers, no work for you.
-Because you say so?
Too old. Try to work in Germany
Let my dad in.
What's your name?
-Nette.
Take his place at the spinner.
-I work in the laundry
Shut up!
Here.
Don't work on bare feet.
No work, Andre!
Scottish system, you're off.
I'm going to work.
Or do your machines work alone?
You cost too much.
-Too much?
Must we pay to work here now,
according to your Scottish system?
I don't speak Flemish,
but I know what you write.
I received countless letters.
I cite :-
Daily children die
at the gates of the factories.
If I didn't know better...
...I would think this is written
by a socialist.
But it's true.
Too many children die.
You only stir up commotion.
Don't forget your catholic subscribers.
As leader of the Catholic Party...
...I won't let you smear the
pillars of our society.
I assure you...
May I introduce my brother Adolf to you?
This is our chairman.
-Pleasure.
You've arrived at the right moment.
I just warned your brother
about the context of his article.
As a priest why don't you try
to reason him.
That would be difficult.
-And why so?
Because I wrote the article
myself.
Decent of you to protect him....
But your cassock makes me
disbelieve you
I hope your conceptions
do right to your costume.
That goes without saying.
But some of your ideas don't
match your clothing.
If you want to keep your soutane,
don't start again.
You're crazy!
Talking to him like that....
What'll we do now?
-We? You just carry on....
...with another article.
Come. Take these two to the six and
from now on take the five as well.
Sort it out among you.
You lot, get to your machines!
To your machines!
Hang your coat there.
Watch out.
Wait till the machine is stationery.
Tie up your hair.
It's dangerous like that.
Keep your hands off me.
-Don't be afraid
I'm not as bad as they say
-Leave me alone
If he touches you once more,
I'll beat him up.
I'll smash his face.
I'll beat Borremans as well.
You don't believe me, do you?
You'll see...
Show Ponnet in!
Monseigneur
-Is what Daens writes true? Or not?
Depends on the point of view
the facts are considered from.
I'm a priest, a shepherd.
-That's not what I asked.
Nobody can deny that poverty
reigns in Aalst, Monseigneur,
just like in many other cities,
but we do our best to help.
Did....Daens ever show you
his sermons?
No. I'm not good enough!
Sometimes he doesn't even
bother to speak to me.
I try to behave like a Christian,
but my feelings do not
really matter here.
You can have it for a week.
You can kiss it at your leisure.
Wear your helmet, because
a bad blow is easily given.
So, Catalina comes in
and you speak to him directly
an remember :
you only have one hour
to save your life.
Borremans, come out,
I'll hit you!
Come out, if you dare!
-Get him, Titus!
Don't!
Stop that dog! - Titus!
Titus!.....Heel!
Leave me alone.
-I want to help you.
Priests are for the rich.
Father, what is going on?
Father, come...your wounds
need treating.
No need to clean up St. Ursula.
No celebration for her this year.
And neither for us. No mass.
No party.
Leave them alone, dad.
Come on, go home, dad.
But father, you are hurt!
You scare people
-Guess so.
But this needs to be tended to.
What's your name?
-Nette, Nette Scholliers.
Come.
We have nothing as it is.
-Mama , this is father...
...Daens.
Good morning, Madame, Monsieur.
Sorry to bother.
I bumped into something.
Sit down, Father. Nette...
Take a clean towel.
Welcome, Father.
Kids, look here!
A real priest in the house.
Frans! Forgive him, Father.
He was fired at the factory.
Louis...Wannes
-No need to wake them.
If they don't seen you
they won't believe you were here.
Come on, Wannes, open your eyes!
Open your eyes Louis!
Doesn't matter. They have to go
to work anyway. On the night-shift.
They never go to school?
The two youngest do, sometimes.
The others work
-Good workers.
All of them. And our Louis....
Louis....
He's a porter at the town hall.
Close your eyes, Father.
Louis, get up, the priest is here.
Let him, he's drunk.
Nette! - Louis is a Buck.
At night the beat up the reds.
Shut up. The Bucks are bastards.
What is going on here?
Someone needs a beating?
If you want to, do like the priest
and beat up your friend Schmitt.
He can't keep his claws to himself.
- Nette, don't discuss this now.
But ma! -Schmitt is boss.
That doesn't mean he can touch me!
No more of this.
Schmitt is not the only one, eh?
-Louis!
-Say that again if you dare.
Let's pray first.
In the name of the Father and the
In the name of the Father and the
son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Lord bless us and this meal.
In the name of the Father and the
son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
A potato, Father?
Or a cup of coffee?
-Thanks - They're Polders.
Nora is a good cook. Enjoy yourself.
Now that you're here, Father,
may I ask you something?
What would you do?
For 30 years you work for a director
through thick and thin.
Shut up!
All these years, you walk in his beautiful procession,
his procession for St. Ursula.
And then, suddenly, he says:
"Get out!"
What would you do, Father?
You'd still go to his procession?
Not me!
No, Father, not me.
Provided his sermon is decent
and deals with higher ideas,
nothing actually opposes a priest
to share with a large audience.
But Father Daens' sermon
is of shocking triviality.
and I regret to say, is revealing
a shameful demagogy.
Quite right, Mr Woeste,
quite right.
But after all, this subject is only
inspired on Rerum Novarum
...and on paternal preoccupations of his holiness
Leon XIII, for the condition of the workers.
This encyclical doesn't mention the stirring of
the workers against those who feed them!
Now, Daens has created such suspicion
that the government considers to
send an investigation committee to Aalst.
What a triumph for our enemies!
-On the contrary, Mr Woeste.
If, as you say,
we are talking about slander
an inquest will prove
that Father Daens is wrong.
A word from you would suffice,
to reduce him to silence.
Father Daens is careless,
Mr Woeste,
But...he has a brilliant mind,
and in that case, I'm not sure
that a remonstration is enough.
Monseigneur, you have other means than a
mere remonstration to ensure his obedience.
When a priest uses his cloth to spread
hostilities, it can be taken away.
Mr Woeste, I'm afraid that only the ecclesiastic
authorities are capable to judge this.
Of course, Monseigneur.
But you must understand me.
I came in everybody's interest,.
to avoid this matter from going
beyond this diocese
and leading us to appeal
to higher instances.
An energetic cure at the right moment
can prevent complications.
Don't you agree?
I understand you perfectly
my son.
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!
Read "The Worker"!
Read Father Daens' new article.
Read "The Worker"!
The paper of good Catholics!
Read "Forwards!"
The real paper for the worker!
Large demonstration in Ghent
for general voting rights!
Read "Forwards!"
the socialist newspaper.
You there. Yes you miss!
He wants you.
You must buy this.
I wrote something for you.
I will read it to you.....
....in your ear.
Leave it. It's a fool from Ghent.
You, Reds, can't read.
Your paper smells of hell.
Give me a clean catholic paper.
Hey, Fonske! - Read "Forwards"!
The real newspaper for the workers!
Here. Read this to me,
I can't read.
Me neither...
Read "The Worker"! - You there, big mouth.
What is written here? Can you tell?
I can't read this catholic jargon.
-I told you he couldn't read.
Give that paper to me.
Ladies,
great news.
"Thanks to Doctor Dupont
and his magical salts,
constipation is a thing
of the past!"
That's not what it says. - No?.
-Who can read? You or me?
Then read us Daens' article!
-Here is your article:
Common sense has prevailed.
The government has
decided that a committee
of 6 honourable personalities
will investigate
the factories of Aalst.
They will be able to interrogate
the workers directly....
Surely, you don't believe, what the
priest says, that they'll listen.
They're all the director's friends.
If you want respect from them,
you must change the government
Hence, the parliament first.
But since we don't have a say in parliament,
we need voting rights first!
Who are you to criticize Daens?
There is no one like him in Ghent.
Your priest says the same as we do.
But we did it first.
So loud that we didn't hear it!
Besides, Daens is in our paper and
not in yours, you red cabbage!
This committee only comes to eat.
No potatoes, but fat steaks.
- What?
That Daens is a saint.
He will change the factories.
Priests are sly and change nothing.
You don't know what a committee is.
We, socialists,
demanded 2 francs for 12 hours.
So what?
Daens asked 12 francs for 2 hours.
You wise ass!
The riddle has been solved
by a great catholic
Put all your children to work.
They'll never get ill.
Here my friend, sell mine too.
You'll be more successful.
So no more schools to raise.
Children. Weavers.....
Sold out already?
Do I get anything?
-For what you want from Nette,
you'll have to do more than read.
Buy us a drink and we'll forget
you are a socialist.
The Bucks!
And our Louis!
There! Let's get him, fellows.
Red dog, damn it!
-Shit ass!
Brussels? This is Aalst.
May I speak to Mr Woeste?
Doesn't work?
Eugene, I've never interfered,
but this concerns my family.
Please, I beg you..
For Junior's sake.
to reconsider the whole thing.
Mr Daens has always been welcome,
but he has gone too far! Christ, he demands
that my factory be investigated.
You must separate matters.
Tell Daens!
-No, I'm telling you.
This is about our son.
-My son will not be educated by a socialist!
Not a word about it!
Shut your mouths!
Take off those rags!
Off!
-They're all I have.
Then go home!
And no stupidities, you hear?
You know what to say!
And us?
-You can't all speak!
These are serious people from
parliament. At your machines!
At your machines!
Marie, ask Julia to
swap places with me.
Julia...Do you want to swap
with Nette?
Schmitt..... An excellent foreman,
knows the factory very well.
Ask him any question you like.
Aren't these machines dangerous?
No, sir. The director has had
new modern machines installed.
It's only dangerous when you drink.
I feel that I am going to find
me a spot here!
Do you like to work at night?
-What about your husband? Any kids?
She only speaks Flemish.
-What does she say??
She's happy.
She says she's very happy here.
She wants to work nights,
so she stays with her kid in the day.
Excuse me. Any toilets here?
I'd like to go to the bathroom.
-No, no, it's ladies only.
What about the men? -This way.
Is it far? - No, at the director's.
Do you speak Flemish?
The locked the children in there!
What is it, my child?
They're lying!
Go on! Tell him!
We're treated like animals.
We...
Every day there are accidents
because we are too tired.
What is she saying?
We're running late, sir.
Problems Schmitt?
-No, sir.
Scholliers !
Satisfied?
Two francs fine.
Stupid cows.
Why didn't you say something?
It was our only chance.
-We tried, but they didn't understand.
You were wiggling with your hips.
We should have pulled together.
There won't be another committee..
We will die like rats!
Come on, Milleke, get on!
This isn't your bed, come on.
Get to work!
At your machines!
Faster, come on!
Milleke!
Damn it, watch where you going.
Mother, is dad coming home tonight?
-Yes, honey, he'll be right there,
but be quiet now...
I'm so hungry, mother.
-I know, son,
but... Listen!
-Josee!
There's daddy..
Josee....Where's my dinner?
-You smell of booze again!
Drink is our downfall!
-Give me food, I tell you,
or I'll go back to the pub!
-A piece of bread is all
there is left in the house.
It's for Fonske.
Give it here!
And speaking about Fonske...
I'll go and ask the factory
When he can start!
No !
He's old enough!
But Jules! He is only six!
-I was only five!
Go away, all of you !
He is dead!
Clarisse, Julia, take him away.
I will get water.
Nette, don't - Get off!
-Come on, Nette..
This is understandable not only
in Flemish.
Everybody, to your machines!
Wait a minute
-Let me through.
Josee.
We are rich!
Jules, did the director give you a raise?
Yeah, as from today, I am working
one floor higher up!
But you're home so early!
Yes, I really hurried.
By the way.., where is our Fonske?
He's gone to rehearse at the choir.
Good. I like that.
"Even without knowing the result,
the coming of the committee
is an important step forward".
"The Committee"? The Committee!
Pieter, Father!
Borremans is closed.
Something must have happened.
Gendarmes!
Draw your sabres!
Officer!
What do you want?
We want to see the committee.
Gentlemen, please come these way.
You can come along if you like .
They have a dead child, commander.
-Take it from them. - But....
Execution!
-Yes, commander.
Charge!
- Oh, no!
Where is Milleke?
It's coming from Mijlenbeeck!
Hey, no! Stop!
Look what you've done.
Fool! Look what you've done..
Get out of here.
Get lost! Get out!
I suggested to Stillemans that you
give a sermon on Rerum Novarum,
but he insisted that I do it.
Have you read my sermon?
-Yes.
What do you think?
-Very bad.
The gospel we just heard is telling
us about the multiplication
of the bread and fish.
Lots of them hundreds,
thousands of them, women and children,
rich and poor, had followed Christ
and had been listening to Him.
When the evening came, the apostles
asked him to send the crowd home,
or to the surrounded villages
to find food and shelter. And he said
"Why don't you feed them?"
They told him there was barely,
enough for themselves,
He looked reproachfully at them,
asked the people to sit,
looked towards heaven,
blessed the loaves of
bread and the fish
and had his disciples share them
There were 5,000 people.
They all ate.
They all had their fill.
Dearly beloved,
if Christ teaches us
that it is our duty
to share without prejudice
of rank or class,
if he gives away the little food he
has to perfect strangers,
then why shouldn't this be the duty
of the Belgian bourgeois class
toward the poor, who they know?
Who work for them!
Or do these people, who claim to be
faithful servants of the pope,
think that the gospel
is not meant for French ears,
because it is written in Latin? People scream:
"We're hungry"! Loud and clear.
And these words should not
be thrown to the wind.
It is time the voices of the
poor were heard in this country.
Besides, my dear friends, how come,
the voice of the rich is always
much louder than a poor man's?
Why is a poor man's vote
worth less than a rich man's?
Who has a right to say: ''you
are good and you are bad,''
''you can vote,
and you cannot.'?"
Unbelievable!
He preaches universal suffrage!
Gentlemen, directors. What does the pope,
whom you like to quote so much,
what does he say,
in his encyclical Rerum Novarum?
"We are convinced
that we should improve
the fate of the lower class
because a large part of them
live in undeserved misery."
My dear friends, it is clear that
our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII, and Christ
are speaking the same language
and that an end should be put
to this organised, established injustice.
And remember, my friends:
you don't have anything.
It is not you who have to share,
but those,
who have just left this church.
How can you be so clumsy?
Thanks to your brutality,
Daens has all the trumps.
Be more clever with you workers.
Give them soup,
knit them scarves...
That will make us popular.
The pope wants more charity.
That's the right policy!
I'm not sure that's enough.
The situation is too serious.
They demand the universal suffrage.
-They'll never have it!
I'm sorry, but...
a lot of people think otherwise.
Half of the factories are striking
for the universal suffrage.
The agitation is such that,
it would be a miracle if Aalst
escapes this revolution.
Mr Woeste, the strikers find support
everywhere, even within our own party.
Father Daens runs a campaign
for the universal suffrage,
within our party.
-Throw him out.
Him, his brother and the others.
-No, that's not enough.
That would turn him into a martyr.
There's only one way to finish him
unfrock him!
In civil clothes
this priest will be a nobody.
I'll go all the way to the Vatican.
Not in that thing, you won't!
-Very funny...
We must be aware that many workers
will turn their back on the Church.
More so the reason not to hesitate
and to be firm to Daens.
I'd love to, but I won't be degraded
to Mr Woeste's errand boy.
Send Daens to the Congo.
They're short of missionaries.
Then Daens will choose for the
blacks and everyone will return.
I know Daens.
Hurry up Willem,
I have work to do.
Sorry Monseigneur, the only solution
here might be a prayer.
Arise, ye wretched of the earth.....
Monseigneur....
- This is the result of your reckless talk!
Father Daens!
You are a priest
to spread God's word,
not the socialists'.
If there is inequality on earth,
it is because God wants it.
I wouldn't say that.
You reason like Woeste..
He turns God into a Belgian
and bars everyone who doesn't
belong to his Belgian heaven.
- Quiet... Daens!
I haven't asked you here
to discuss politics.
Once more, you embarrass me
with your difficult character.
Instead of visiting pubs in your robe,
don't you think you should look at
yourself and try to find out
whether all this popularity
doesn't stem from the pursuit
of pure vanity?
You don't listen to anybody,
because you want them
to listen to you!
That is not the issue.
The seriousness of the situation
in Aalst escapes you.
You and I are facing hard times.
Flanders is lost if Aalst becomes red.
That's what catholic workers think.
