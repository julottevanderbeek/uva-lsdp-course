I'd give a nickel
to find out why they're chasing us.
I say who steals what, from whom,
and where.
- Is this your money?
- It is now.
I don't care who gets hurt,
just as long as I get my money back.
You figured out yet if it's us he's chasing?
Yep, got it all figured out.
- See anybody in front of us?
- No.
Then it's us.
Enos, you got your ears on? Come on.
Yes, sir. I read you, Sheriff.
I'm at Parkins Road, like you said. Over.
I got them heading towards you,
about 3 miles out. Over.
Come ahead, Sheriff.
There ain't nobody getting past me.
I'm gonna turn off here,
just to see if he's serious.
He's serious.
But we ain't done nothing wrong,
have we?
- We're gonna hit old Slade.
- Hang a right. Come on.
- How's he know it's us if it ain't our car?
- I bet your dazzling driving gave us away.
And if you don't step on it,
he'll give us a ticket for illegal parking.
I'd give a nickel
to find out why they're chasing us.
- There's Enos. You can ask him.
- All right.
I was kidding!
Sheriff Coltrane here. Over.
You come see me.
You see, I'm in hot pursuit,
and I'm just gonna get them...
Now, Rosco. Don't make me tell you twice.
Roger, wilco, and out.
And cut that CB shuck and jive.
Just say goodbye and
hightail your rear end over here pronto.
Yes, sir.
Enos, how are you doing, boy?
I'm in hot pursuit, Sheriff, and closing.
That's a boy, get them!
Just stay with them, and stay on them.
Over and out.
He sure is good, old Enos is.
He should be.
He's learned from his daddy...
and his daddy ran moonshine
right alongside your daddy and mine.
He sure is good.
You can tell him that.
He's gonna catch us any minute,
the way you're poking along.
I was gonna let you take that bow
and shoot his tires out...
but I'm afraid you'd miss and hit ours.
I wish there were some girls around here.
Maybe you'd show off and drive faster.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- Moonshine.
You keep her humping
and I'll ditch the evidence.
Who was Cooter running that whiskey for?
Somebody luckier than us.
That somebody
is gonna be awful peeved at Cooter.
We'll write him an excuse.
Did you see that?
Not unless you mean Mary Kaye Porter.
honey-blonde hair, baby blue eyes,
nice smile, and loads of dimples.
What's she doing on a back mountain road
that don't see a car in two or three hours?
We're about to find out.
- Hey there, Mary Kaye.
- Hey there, yourself.
I ain't seen you in these parts in months.
How's about nine?
- Yeah, how about that?
- Thanks for stopping and all.
Every day, it takes a little more
huffing and puffing.
- Where are you headed?
- Florida.
- That is south.
- I want to go there and have my baby.
I didn't know you had any kin in Florida.
No, we don't.
I've always been partial to Florida.
Taking the scenic route?
Well, the Sheriff don't allow hitchhiking
on the freeways.
Listen, I really appreciate this. I really do.
- How's Uncle Jesse, and Daisy, and them?
- They're fine.
- Right, y'all set back there?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
You okay?
Either they're after me for hitchhiking,
or Bo's turned into Richard Petty.
Sorry. Old Bo here's a leadfoot.
It won't happen again.
Sheriff Rosco Coltrane here.
Boss...
If you ain't here inside five minutes,
you will be...
- I'm in!
on Frontage Road.
- Rosco.
- Yes, sir.
One of my best customers,
namely Mayor...
Erase that.
One of my best customers,
who shall remain nameless...
has been waiting over two hours
for delivery.
Well, Boss, you know
I'd do anything in the world for you.
But you know I can't be hauling
moonshine in a police car.
- Has anybody asked you, jackass?
- No, sir.
All my regular drivers
went to the church fish-fry.
I wish I'd gone. They got some girls
down there that's got me...
So I hired Cooter Davenport.
He loves my money.
Now it looks like
he loves my whiskey, too.
He ought to. That's good shine.
With those navel oranges,
and you get some apple juice...
That wasn't Cooter who's got
your whiskey. It's them Duke boys.
Bo and Luke Duke.
In fact, I was after them.
I got them down a dirt road,
got them boxed in...
and they hooked this 180-degreer...
Well, then I want Cooter, or Bo, or Luke...
or somebody arrested!
- For stealing your moonshine?
- For possession of moonshine.
- It's illegal. Look it up.
- Right.
- Damn, I hate a thief.
- Me, too. I hate those guys.
Besides, anybody stealing from me...
- sets a bad example for everybody else.
- Right.
When it comes to stealing
in Hazzard County...
I say who steals what, from whom,
and where.
Right, I'm gonna get them this time.
I'm gonna get over there.
You just better, or else you will be...
The night rent-a-cop
at the drive-in deli on Frontage Road.
- Old Enos is heading home for lunch.
- Well, even deputies get hungry.
You know, one thing you can count on
with any car of Cooter Davenport's...
is you can't count on it.
You know, Mary Kaye, I never got to meet
this husband of yours...
but, if you don't mind my saying so,
he's elevated being a fool to a new level.
I was the fool.
See, I thought we could make it work.
But he's out of my life now.
And, anyway,
Andy's family is happy it's over.
Well, they gotta be nuts.
Not wanting to see their own grandchild?
Being country, I wasn't right for their son.
You know, with college, society,
money, and all.
What you just said about money and all...
It seems to me
what you should have done...
is had them send you some
so you could get back to Florida...
get that baby of yours born...
and help you out
until you get back on your feet again.
I don't want anything from them,
not even a wedding ring.
Except you got something.
Yeah, I thought that way at first, too,
but I don't now.
I mean, I'm glad. 'Cause it's a life.
Hey, there may be a president in there.
Well, Mr. President, would you
and your mother please get in the car?
Ms. President. She's a girl.
Enos, this is Sheriff Rosco.
You got your ears on? Come on.
Here I am, Sheriff.
Are you still in hot pursuit, boy?
More like lukewarm, Sheriff. I lost them.
You lost them?
One thing about you, Enos,
you're consistent.
Give me about $2 worth, will you?
- We're gonna have to help her out.
- She'd never take a handout.
Maybe we could kind of slip the money
into her suitcase...
and she'd find it when she got to Florida?
Keeping some back for lunch,
I got about $6.
I got $4 and some change.
She sure didn't take much.
Well, I'm surprised
you Duke boys just didn't drive off with it.
You sure had us fooled.
- Is this your money?
- It is now.
You in trouble, Mary Kaye?
You see, you've already decided the worst.
No, not us.
- Where did you get it?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
How much is in there?
Exactly $118,254.37.
$118,254.
And 37 cents.
That is a considerable amount to be lost.
Lost? More like stolen.
And you say all that money is down here,
in my county?
Yep, and I know just who I'm looking for.
But I wouldn't step on to your turf
without touching base with you.
I stay out of Atlanta
and you stay out of Hazzard County.
- Good fences make good neighbors.
- True.
Except for now.
You say you know who.
Mary Kaye Porter.
That's Henry Porter's youngest.
- She wouldn't.
- She would and she did.
Her boyfriend was working for me,
had the money at the house.
When he got arrested, she took it.
Is there something I can do to help?
Leo and me will handle this one.
I'm not sure I like the word "handle."
Mr. McQuade
will be a whole lot friendlier...
when he finds
that none of his money is missing.
That includes the 37 cents.
$118,254.37.
- And not one penny of it's for yourself?
- That's what I said.
I know that's what you said, but...
Child support at $100 a week
for 18 years...
comes to exactly $93,600.
And the rest is for medical expenses,
estimated dental costs...
and college education.
Plus, enough to cover the rate of inflation
figured at about 10% a year.
I'm sure glad
she didn't get a craving for pickles.
- I did, early on.
- So am I.
Right now,
I'll die if I don't find some pickled peaches.
I'm sure glad I'm not pregnant.
I think I'd get sick.
Don't worry.
For a little old country girl,
you've sure got a mind for figures.
Little old country girls
can add and multiply, you know. Here.
Anyway, there's one thing more.
There aren't any parents.
My husband's, I mean. I made them up.
- Did you make up your husband, too?
- No.
Well, we talked about getting married,
but he said there wasn't any rush.
At the time.
I loved him and he loved me.
He also said that he was in real estate.
Not true.
He worked for somebody named McQuade,
a gangster in Atlanta.
My husband was sent to jail...
and Mr. McQuade didn't lift a finger,
or a lawyer, to help.
That's Andy's child,
but that's not Andy's money.
Andy was supposed to deliver
that money to McQuade, right?
Yeah, I guess.
You got any idea what McQuade's
gonna do to you when he finds you?
Listen, y'all have been really sweet...
but I think I'm gonna leave you here,
'cause I don't want you to get involved.
If that ain't indigestion, we're in trouble.
How do you keep from cracking up
with that old Boss Hogg?
It wasn't easy.
How about when he says,
he stays out of Atlanta...
if you stay out of Hazzard County?
- Now, that's fair.
- Sure, to us.
- Come in.
- Yes, Boss?
Tell me something.
Do you know the way to the Porter farm?
Sure do.
I went to school with Mary Kaye Porter
since the third grade.
- I ain't seen her lately.
- You'll see her today.
- How come?
- She's come into a great sum of money.
And it could be very dangerous for her
to hold on to it.
- And you're gonna help her out?
- Right.
By holding on to it yourself?
Something like that. Let's go.
- Here he comes.
- That's the cue.
I ask you boys not to haul moonshine.
And what do you do?
- You don't listen to me.
- Why did you have to go and do this?
Now you're gonna end up going to jail!
I've told you time and time again.
I was just saying to Daisy,
"I think company's coming."
Listen, I heard voices in here...
We were reminiscing about when the boys
got caught moonshining two years ago.
Bo and Luke ain't here.
They're gonna be here, and soon.
I know that.
I doubt that...
seeing as how they're driving a car
full of Boss Hogg's whiskey.
Cooter called me
and told me about the mix-up of the cars.
Jesse, you don't mind if I stick around
for a little while, do you?
Of course not, Rosco.
You're just a sheriff trying to do your job.
- That's right.
- And I'm an uncle trying to do his job.
- What?
- Keeping you from doing your job.
You don't think
those boys are dumb enough...
not to get rid of the whiskey
that's in that car, do you?
Yeah, but the question is
did they have time to look into the trunk?
It don't make no difference anyway,
because they have been observed...
transporting contraband whiskey
in that vehicle.
That's just gonna
blow the hell out of their probation.
I bet that threw a pucker into you two,
didn't it?
Another 10 miles, we'll be at the farm...
and then there's about 40 miles
of rough road to get to the hospital.
We could cut down that old tote road
across the back of Narramore's place...
- and save a couple of miles.
- We do that, rutted like it is...
and we'll have us another passenger
before we get there.
What do you think it is?
This fan belt's loose, for one thing.
This engine's so souped-up, driving it
as slow as we have has given it the colic.
Go grab that tool kit out of the back seat.
You just hold on now to everything, okay?
Start making like one hell of a mechanic,
or we're gonna become midwives.
Ever since those boys
were put on probation...
they've been thumbing
their nose at the law. Namely, me.
Given your kind of law, maybe thumbing
their nose was a gracious gesture.
You were a fair-to-middling lawman, once.
- I sure was, for 20 long, underpaid years.
- What happened to your sense of justice?
It went with 20 cent bread
and 35 cent gasoline.
Along with my pension, which the people
in Hazzard County vetoed.
If it's for you, we'll let you know.
Hello.
Hello, Daisy?
Is Uncle Mr. Jesse still there?
Yeah. It's Cooter again.
Hey, Cooter.
Sir, are Bo and Luke back yet?
They've been gone for an awful long time.
Are you still there?
Well, that's good to hear.
What's awful good to hear?
We must have a bad connection
or something.
That's fine.
I'm glad you got your whiskey back.
No, he's sitting right here,
waiting for the boys.
Cooter, never mind what I said.
Rosco is on his way over to your place
right now, so stall him.
Give the boys time to dump that whiskey.
Yes, sir.
Some days,
you can't even cram it into second...
even if you double-clutch it.
What in the world could that
little Porter girl do with all that money?
$118,254.37.
- What's that, Boss?
- Nothing.
I just hate to see money
leave Hazzard County.
Bad for the economy. Mine.
All right, hit it.
Try it again.
There she is. Pull on over now.
Wait a minute.
We got a lady with a baby back there.
- Where's my money?
- It's my baby's money, Mr. McQuade.
Rube, I don't care who gets hurt
just as long as I get my money back.
You're gonna have to take it.
You want me to handle this,
Mr. McQuade?
- I'm very disappointed in you, Mary Kaye.
- Yeah, me, too.
No quick moves
from either of you two hayseeds.
Help Mary Kaye out, Leo.
- No!
- Come on, don't hurt her.
Let go of me.
- Mr. McQuade, I gotta say something.
- Say goodbye.
We'll give you the money back.
Of course you will, my dear.
Come on, let's get them.
How're you doing, Mary Kaye?
Just dandy.
No!
If we throw it out,
they'll stop to pick it up.
No, it's for my baby.
Leave her be. She's got problems enough.
Great.
Now, besides the Sheriff, we got
two hoods from Atlanta following us.
She's running out of time.
If we can make it to Uncle Jesse's,
we'll take you to hospital in his pickup.
I'm willing.
Cooter Davenport,
don't you tell me they didn't come back!
I heard with my own ears. Those boys
are running moonshine for you.
- Ain't that illegal?
- They're running in that blue Plymouth.
Sheriff, I wish to report a stolen car.
A 1975 blue Plymouth Fury
with Hazzard County...
We know what it looks like. We've been
chasing the dang thing all morning.
That's right.
Runs good, don't it?
She sure does.
What do you run in that thing?
I couldn't even catch it.
- What kind of headers are in there?
- Tuned Edelbrocks.
- Tuned Edelbrocks?
- I had them put it in last week in Rutledge.
I was running Hookers
on that Chevy that I had.
But I totaled the Chevy,
and I was thinking about...
- Enos, what are you doing?
- Just a minute.
This is what we need on the Sheriff's car.
Y'all come by here anytime.
I'll give you a good price
on any kind of work that y'all need.
Damn and double damn!
Howdy.
- Hello, McQuade.
- Hello, Boss.
Fine day.
They're all fine.
Some are just finer than others.
That there's the undying truth, ain't it?
We ain't found her, neither.
Well, good hunting.
That's the word.
- Hi, Daisy.
- Hi!
The Sheriff was here.
He'll just have to stand in line
and wait his turn.
Don't worry about it. We already dumped
the whiskey that was in the car.
Including the shine that's in the trunk?
- The trunk?
- Yeah.
Oh, Lord.
We gotta borrow your truck
and take Mary Kaye to the hospital.
There ain't gonna be time
to take her anywhere, except in the house.
Now you two boys go boil some water.
Daisy, you go turn down the comforter.
We's gonna have us a baby.
You sure you can do it?
The only thing we've seen you midwife
is a couple of goats and two mares.
My mama was the best midwife
in all of Hazzard County.
Bo, you go tear up some clean sheets.
Just go do what I told you.
Now, Mary Kaye, don't you be afraid.
I can't tell you the number of little babies
I've brought into this world.
The very first sight they ever did see
in their whole life...
was this handsome face of mine.
Including them two up there.
Now go on. Do what I told you.
Come on, then.
It's okay. I'm all right.
It's good for you.
Some more.
We's gonna have company real soon.
Come on, Mary Kaye. Hold on.
Breathe.
Keep breathing.
We got enough boiling water here to wash
an elephant and two blue tick hounds.
That's supposed to keep
the new father busy.
- I ain't the father.
- I ain't, either.
But I'll tell you something.
With that lady in there,
I wouldn't half mind.
Where's my money, son?
With all that happened today
with Mary Kaye's baby...
I don't care about the baby.
I care about my money.
Nobody forgets $100,000.
It's in the...
It's McQuade and Leo.
Keep him covered up.
Uncle Jesse,
we're between a rock and a hard place.
Uncle Jesse.
They're reloading.
Bo, Luke, get out there.
- See what you can do.
- All right.
You stay with her.
Hold it right there.
I say, McQuade.
Would you step over here, please?
I want to talk with you.
- What in the hell do you want?
- To begin with, watch your language.
Now then, McQuade...
Could you please look at me
when I'm talking to you?
You go paging me when there's Indians
out there shooting at me?
There's no Indians around here.
I once put in for federal funds...
to help the Indians in Hazzard County.
But the federals couldn't find
one single Indian.
No, you're dodging arrows from those
Duke boys because you shot at them.
I don't waste no love with them Dukes,
but I won't have shooting in my county.
It's bad for business. Mine.
Slot machines, rake-offs, bribing paving
contractors never got nobody killed.
But guns, no sirree, Bob!
You get back right to Atlanta,
or you're gonna try my patience.
Listen, you fat clown,
I'm trying to get my money back.
If it takes shooting to get it back,
there's gonna be shooting.
I'm sorry you take that attitude, McQuade.
Real sorry.
Hold your fire, boys!
It's me, Boss Hogg, your friend.
If I thought those meanies
would go away and leave us alone...
I'd give them their money back.
- Where is it, Mary Kaye?
- Where's what?
The money.
I don't rightly remember what I did with it.
Last thing I remember, I was having
the pains and then the baby came.
First off, it ain't yours to give.
- What are you saying?
- It's his.
I know he don't have no name yet,
but he's here.
And we're all near getting ourselves killed
so he can keep that money.
So, you see,
it ain't even yours to give away.
- That's true.
- Anyways, you certainly can't give away...
what you can't remember
what you did with, can you?
Why am I getting a headache from you?
I think we're pretty smart
for a couple of country gals.
How come nobody else knows that?
Because we keep it a pretty good secret.
And let's keep it that way.
All three of us.
Now those Dukes have gone too far.
My toe! You shot my toe!
Do you think I'm a hick sheriff?
I can part your hair anytime.
You won't play football anymore, boy.
- Look, let's make a deal.
- No deals. I want my money.
- It's yours if you leave us alone.
- You're dead and so are they.
All right, shoot.
You'll never see the money.
Freeze! You're under arrest!
You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you say...
- Enos, don't do that now.
That constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment.
- That a boy. Hold him right there.
- Y'all better get out of the way.
There's fixing to be a heck of an explosion.
- Now, one second.
- You can have the money.
Oh, my gosh! All that money is in there.
In there? Oh, no!
- My money!
- My evidence!
Yep, at least we got rid of that.
Yes, sir,
that could have been a blue sedan.
Yep, could have been.
And that could have been moonshine
that blew up in the trunk.
You guys think you're smart, don't you?
- Is the Sheriff gone?
- Yeah, he's gone, and Boss Hogg, too.
Good.
I guess I forgot to tell anybody
that I brought this in.
Brought what?
This!
Would you look at that!
This is yours, little fella.
English
Hey, my name is Daisy.
And I want to be a star.
You think Daisy's been took?
You're gonna need help, hoss.
He's got it.
If that had been a wild boar,
you would have missed.
If that had been a wild boar,
he wouldn't be in our back yard.
That ain't necessarily so.
Hey, everybody, listen! It's my song!
Jessi Colter is singing my song!
Come on.
- What are you talking about?
- I wrote this song. I wrote it!
- Who did you say that was singing?
- It's Jessi Colter.
Big 40 Country Hits Album.
I just can't believe it.
That sounded real good, Daisy.
It took me forever
to write the notes down.
And after all these years
of writing songs...
I sent it to this music publisher,
and now Jessi Colter is singing it!
That's great. How much did they pay you?
- The pay?
- Well, they did pay you.
No, I paid them.
That's the sort of business
we ought to have.
There was a magazine ad where
you pay $50, and they publish your song.
So I saved up all my tip money
till I had enough...
and I sent my song in, and I got
this letter back saying it was published.
Now, Daisy, some of those ads
are for phony operations.
You think Daisy's been took?
They got Daisy's song.
Jessi Colter got a recording.
And Daisy's got $50 less
than she had before.
That's took.
And $50 in nickel tips
ain't easy to come by.
When you record a song,
you're supposed to get royalties.
Where is this publishing company,
anyway?
It's Lester Starr Music Publishing
in Atlanta.
That place ain't been right
since Sherman burned it.
Come on, I'll bet this Mr. Starr
just made an oversight.
Think we ought to go in to Atlanta
and check it out?
Maybe you ought to.
But you gotta remember, boys...
you gotta give them city people
the benefit of the doubt.
It ain't right to take advantage of them
just because they don't know no better.
So just keep it simple.
Now, why can't I go with you?
It's my song.
- Because Jesse told us to handle it.
- Okay.
But y'all be careful now.
Jojo, that stuff
ready for the pressing plant yet?
Is that stuff ready
for the pressing plant yet?
Nearly done.
I'm expecting some hot tracks,
ripped off in Nashville.
They're coming in today,
and I want them on this run.
- Mr. Starr.
- Yeah, what is it?
- There are two boys here to see you.
- Send them in.
Hi, guys.
Dodie.
Come on in, fellas. Come in.
Good to see you. I guess
you want me to hear your song, right?
Wrong.
Sheet music?
You write your own music? Heavy!
Our Cousin Daisy wrote it.
- This has my company's name on it.
- That's what we came to talk to you about.
We heard Jessi Colter
singing it on the radio.
No kidding? How about that?
We was just wondering
about the royalties.
Royalties?
Funny.
It was recorded. Wasn't there a contract?
Look, guys,
I don't know anything about that.
Your cousin sent us $50
to publish her song. We did it.
End of transaction.
Now get out of here. I'm very busy.
Look, mister, if you're not gonna be
fair about this...
then we want Daisy's $50 back.
Jojo, did you hear that?
This guy just threatened me.
You guys get out of here before Jojo
mails you back to tobacco road.
You're gonna need help, hoss.
- He's got it.
- Yeah.
And you best be going.
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want to see your faces
around here again.
Gee, I knew it was tough
to get into show business.
But I never heard of them
using guns to keep you out.
Those.44 Magnums convinced me.
Why would a music publisher
need a bodyguard?
I don't know.
I just don't like being sent home
with my tail tucked.
We can't go home. Tucked or otherwise.
Now, Jesse said either get the royalties
or Daisy's $50 back.
We ain't got either.
Maybe we could reason with Starr,
if his trained ape wasn't around.
How do you plan to do that?
What's the last thing
he expects right now?
A fat man in a red suit, driving reindeer.
No, us.
We'll use Stonewall Jackson's old tactic:
When they think you're running away,
you attack.
Stonewall Jackson
had the Confederate Army. I've got you.
And General Lee.
I'm going to be in back with the motor
running, in case this doesn't work out.
And it won't.
Luke, if you don't believe in this,
how come you're doing it?
Because facing a gorilla with two guns
is easier than facing Jesse. Let's go.
Now, Daisy, you pay close attention,
all right?
Sorry, Boss.
Hey, what are you guys... Where's Jojo?
Now look, Mr. Starr,
all we want is Daisy's royalty money.
Or her $50 back.
Now, is that too much to ask for?
- You guys are nuts!
- Mr. Starr...
Jojo, are you all right?
- Cops.
- Cops?
- Outside. It's a raid.
- A raid?
What are we going to do?
Come on, mister.
Jojo.
God, and us on probation.
What are we gonna do?
- Run.
- Hold them, Jojo!
Boss, it's a raid!
This is great!
My keys! I forgot my keys.
Wake up, it's a raid!
Those dummies
are still carrying the evidence.
Come on, it's left!
I think you did well and lost them.
Me!
Caught like poor trash in a police raid!
Boss, I think the reason that was...
was because they didn't recognize
who you are. You know...
That was some close call in Atlanta.
I sure don't want
nothing like that happening...
to my record-pressing plant
here in Hazzard County.
- What could happen?
- What could happen?
One of your dumb deputies could go
blundering into my plant, that's what.
With my luck,
it would turn out to be somebody honest.
There's nobody in my department honest.
Except Enos.
And I'll make sure
I keep him somewhere else.
I got a tin ear for music.
The only reason I got into this
was to get me a big syndicate tie-in.
After all, if a man don't grow, he dies.
That's what you got in the raid?
I've heard all of Waylon Jennings' songs.
I mean I've got them.
I've never heard any of those.
Maybe they're not released yet.
Then how did Starr get them?
And why did he get rid of it
when the police showed up?
You know, if that there was corn whisky
instead of a silly tape...
I'd say it was hot.
Wait a minute.
If that's a hot tape
of an unreleased record...
this could be a piracy operation.
- Gotta be.
- What's that?
Music pirates make a fortune stealing
tapes and making illegal recordings.
You read about it all the time.
That's all well and good, but this isn't
helping Daisy with her situation.
If Starr won't help,
why don't we go right to the top?
Can't do that.
- The preacher's out of town.
- No.
Look, Jessi Colter
recorded Daisy's song, right?
Why don't we go right to her?
She's gonna be in Atlanta
this whole week.
That's a good idea.
And this time, boys, get it right.
I'm sorry, honey,
but Jessi's never recorded that.
But Lester Starr said that she...
Lester Starr finds ambitious singers
who can imitate a name artist...
then fakes a record on them.
Piracy costs the music business millions.
Boy, it must!
I just started, and it's just cost me $50.
If everybody knows about this guy, Starr,
why hasn't anyone done anything?
You gotta catch him in the act.
I hear they just about nailed him
in a raid yesterday, but somebody blew it.
Maybe you folks could help.
If those cops blew that raid yesterday,
maybe we can find another way.
Something that would nail him
right to the wall, for everybody.
Sounds great. But what?
Starr makes phony tapes, right?
What if we con him
into making another one of Jessi?
Yeah, that'd blow his operation sky high.
But he already knows what we look like.
What if we send in Daisy
as a Jessi Colter sound-alike?
Luke, I sound more like Waylon Jennings
than I do Jessi Colter.
But you'd sound a lot like Jessi
if you played him a Jessi Colter tape.
That's terrific.
I'll get on the phone
with Loretta Lynn and Donna Fargo.
They've been stung by pirates.
I'll put together a rehearsal tape
on both of them.
Where can we find this guy, Starr?
River Pines. A lot of musicians live there.
Bands, groupies, whatever.
- A sort of Disneyland for the weird.
- We ought to fit right in.
I'll get that tape for you.
Looks like you're gonna be a star, after all.
Starr's in the apartment upstairs.
We'll be watching the door.
Be sure to holler if you need help.
Boss, believe me...
Hold on.
Hey, my name is Daisy.
And I want to be a star.
- Come in.
- Okay.
I know millions of girls
are always dropping in here...
with cheap tricks
to help you get their careers started.
Well, I decided to do the same thing.
I think you made the right move.
I swear, I'll do anything
to get you to listen to my tape.
- Anything?
- About.
Now, look,
if you're gonna seduce me or something...
shouldn't you be offering me a drink?
Of course I really don't know,
you see, I'm so country.
Really?
Baby, I'll make you a singing star
without even hearing you.
I'm gonna put on my tape,
and you can listen.
My act is very unique.
You see, I've got this freak voice.
So I do sound-alikes.
And with all these singers getting rich,
imitating people who are dead...
I decided to pull a switch
and sound like people who are alive.
- Think it'll catch on?
- Sure.
Now, this is only a rehearsal tape.
Just rhythm behind me.
It's my Jessi Colter.
Is that you?
You do sound a little like her.
This is my Loretta Lynn.
And this is my Donna Fargo.
We're gonna make a fortune.
Yeah, I thought we might.
When can we start?
Tomorrow. Today. Right now!
- Then it's a deal?
- It's a deal.
I'll set up a test session
about day after tomorrow.
We'll use stolen music tracks behind you.
Baby, this is gonna be...
Where are you going?
You just set up that recording session,
and I'll call you.
Millions. We'll make millions.
It's the least I can do for a man
who didn't try to take advantage of me.
You know what? Y'all are about as handy
as a left-handed anvil.
While I'm getting attacked
by this lecherous midget...
you two are orgying all over that pool.
- Did he go for it?
- Did he take the bait?
He's gonna make me queen of the pirates.
- Fantastic.
- And thanks for asking about my virtue...
which you didn't, being intact, which it is.
- Do you understand that?
- No.
This freaky chick can sound like anybody.
No, Boss, she doesn't do Kate Smith.
If you wanna make it big in piracy,
listen to the radio more.
Well, look here,
I've been waiting for something like this...
to make that syndicate
sit up and take notice.
I sure hope it works.
See, I better hear her sing for myself.
Okay. I tell you what,
I'll bring her to the plant.
And you can have those biggies
down there, too.
But remember, these dudes
are very nervous about the law.
Set it up. They're protected.
I own this county!
Right.
Kind of stick out, don't they?
Anybody that dumb
has got to work for Starr.
Yep. That must be the bodyguard.
You gonna follow them in a junkyard?
We'll blow the surveillance.
You want to file a report
saying we lost them?
Didn't Starr hire himself
some rookie hoods?
- That's right.
- Nice driving, brother.
This is Unit One. I think we've lost them.
I sure wish there was some other way.
Starr's been stealing money hand over fist
from nice people like Jessi Colter.
And lots of other people like you...
who can't afford to be cheated out of $50.
They can't stop him.
- Besides, we asked him nice.
- I know that.
It's just that tomorrow,
when I go into that studio...
I'm gonna be treated like somebody.
For one day, I'll be a star.
It sure is gonna put a damper on it
when y'all blow the place apart.
Was everything all right
when you called Starr up?
He was panting so hard my ear got wet.
I'm meeting him tomorrow at his place,
and from there we go to the hidden studio.
We'll be right behind you, all the way.
Won't he spot you driving General Lee?
We'll be in this car,
if I can ever get her tuned up.
Did Starr say anything
about where the studio is?
No. Somewhere in the boonies.
The studio and the pressing plant
are together. There's gonna be a crowd.
Starr said something
about syndicate men.
Syndicate men?
Now, Rosco, I want you to listen good.
These are the syndicate boys
I've been trying to hook up with.
Yeah, Boss. Now, I understand.
These boys get nervous
when the law is around.
So I want you and your deputies
to lay low.
Tomorrow, the law is out to lunch.
Lunch. Right. I'll take care of it, Boss.
So you FBI gentlemen...
actually think there's a music
conspiracy ring right here in Hazzard?
- That's right, Sheriff.
- Yeah, this is one of the top pirates.
I don't know him.
Lester Starr. We've had him
under surveillance for months.
We almost had him with the goods
in a recent raid.
But he dumped some evidence
on these two confederates...
who got away.
We think they may live
around here somewhere.
I'll tell you something,
if I spot them, I'll just...
Just maintain surveillance and notify us.
We'll take it from there.
Right. I'll just let you guys...
I tell you, the FBI had pictures
of the guys they were after.
It was Bo and Luke Duke.
It seems they're tied in...
with some big organization just like yours.
Just like mine? No way.
Maybe you've gone senile
and hired them by accident.
Rosco, this ain't no two-bit operation.
I'm working with pros!
I don't know what amateurs
like Bo and Luke Duke are doing.
The FBI told me if I was to spot them,
I'm supposed to call them.
If you spot them, you nail them, pea brain!
Ain't we been trying to get them
on something? Bo, Luke, Daisy.
Well, they're doing something wrong,
or the FBI wouldn't be after them.
That's all we need
to revoke their probation...
and send them back to prison.
- But the FBl...
- Don't run this county!
- You do.
- I do.
Are you two sure
you got everything straight?
- Got it.
- I want you...
- Not bad.
- Looking good.
Nice, Daisy.
I was just telling the boys
you've got to make sure...
that everybody is out of that
pressing plant before they blow it up.
Because the Dukes revenge on property,
not people.
I will.
Remember, when you're with Starr,
don't look for us. We'll be behind you.
Sing pretty.
You all right?
It's just that I was so excited
when I thought...
something had finally happened
with one of my songs.
I know that them songs
has been a long-time dream of yours.
That's why we got to stop this Starr fella.
Any man ornery enough to steal
another person's dreams...
deserves everything he gets.
Well, at least for one day,
I'm going to be a star.
Even if it isn't for real.
Most people never get that.
Most stars
never get to be as big as you are.
Right now, around here.
How did you get to be so wise?
What are old men for?
- Are you sure everything is set?
- Sure, pretty Bo.
The beer's cold, the CB's hot,
and the girls are ready.
- They want you on the CB.
- I'll be right back, fellas.
Ruby?
What in the world are you doing
working here?
Honey, after going with you,
this was a step up in the world.
Still bitter?
We got to get out of here.
The cops are coming.
You were going to move outside
of Hazzard County, anyway.
It's a pity. We just had set up here.
Besides, we met a lot of nice folks.
Stay where it's safe.
You ought to know better.
I'll drive the motor home.
You get the scrap heap.
Come on.
Holy cats!
We're headed back
towards Hazzard County.
I can read.
Terrific. We also got us a tail,
hanging way back.
That looks like those same guys
we left in the junkyard.
Wait a minute.
They can't be Starr's guards
'cause they're in front of us.
I ever tell you what a treat it is
working with your keen mind?
Then who are they?
- Sheriff, what are you doing? All...
- Hush.
I'd have Enos read you your rights,
but you ain't got any...
- because you broke probation.
- Hi, fellas.
- What's the charge?
- Cohorting with known criminals.
The only known criminals
we consort with is you.
You got a nasty mouth on you, Duke boy.
You didn't know it,
but the FBI was trailing you.
They've got pictures of you two
cohorting with musical pirates.
Come on, you'll have to go with us.
Get out of that car!
- Can I bring this with me?
- What?
- Dynamite.
- Judas priest on a pony!
- We made it.
- Yeah, we also lost Daisy.
Hey, lead-foot.
How are you doing, Farrah Fawcett?
- Hey, Cooter.
- What's happening?
Nothing much.
We've just been chased by the FBI.
We just dynamited one of Rosco's cars.
What's up with you?
Nothing new. Voltage meter. Slick.
Just like New York City.
What did y'all do to the FBI?
They was chasing us, so we wrecked
one of their cars in the junkyard.
- Did you total it?
- No, just a little body damage.
You tell them I'll give them
a real good price on a complete body job.
We'll have to send them boys
a note of apology.
I like the FBI. They got a good TV show.
Cooter, Daisy's in trouble.
Now, we was following her,
and the FBI was following us.
The sheriff caught us and we got away,
but we lost Daisy.
So the FBI is following Daisy?
Why don't y'all follow the FBI?
And then you'll find Daisy.
"Out of the mouth of babes,"
as Jesse would say.
That's right. Cooter, you do us a favor.
Get on your CB and put a spot on them.
They may be monitoring us.
- I got you covered.
- All right.
Breaker One, I might be crazy,
but I ain't dumb.
Crazy Cooter coming at you.
Anybody home on the Hazzard net?
Dreams, that's what it's all about.
And they're hard to come by.
You and me, baby,
this is going to be a dream come true.
- I still don't understand the setup here.
- It's very simple.
That's the pressing plant,
that's the recording studio.
- What do you think?
- It's not the Grand Ole Opry.
It's not supposed to be.
Jojo, any sign of the boss
and the syndicate?
You're gonna knock them dead.
Excuse me. Do you have
a little girls' room around here?
- Sure, right over there.
- Okay.
Enos, what's wrong with you?
- The FBI is in there.
- FBI!
Hi, fellas.
Your guns were here yesterday.
They've just...
The surveillance team you talked to
has spotted the plant.
They're watching it. We're the raid team,
and we're going in now.
Raid team?
Let's go, guys.
- Just go, then.
- Sheriff, I just love a good raid.
- Come on.
- Come in, old Coot.
- We're right on top of that.
Read you, Cooter. We're on our way.
Can you relay that to Mabel?
This is it, boys. I foreclosed on it...
and turned it into a studio
and a record-pressing plant.
- Still looks like a farm, though, don't it?
- What's that smell?
Fresh air. And inside this studio...
is a lady with a trick voice
who's gonna make us all a ton.
She'd better.
We're taking a risk being here.
Robert, you keep your eyes peeled.
This place gives me the creeps.
No alleys, no sewers, no place to hide.
I sure hope Mabel got that message.
With Cooter's transmitter,
they'll get it in Moscow.
- So where is she?
- In the ladies' room. She's a little nervous.
Here she is now.
Come in here, sweetheart.
- Guys, I'd like you to meet...
- Boss!
Daisy Duke!
You didn't tell me that Boss was the boss.
You two know each other?
Yeah, I know her.
I just don't know anything about her.
We made this trip,
and you ain't ever heard her sing?
No, why, we were both
in the same church choir.
Isn't that so, Daisy?
- Yes, Boss sings bass.
- No kidding.
That's right.
- Let's get on with it.
- Excuse me...
- I have to go to the little girls' room.
- Again?
Me, too.
- You can't come in here!
- It's as good a place to die as any.
- You trying to get us killed?
- I'm trying to get my $50 back.
What $50? Never mind.
I don't know what you Dukes are up to...
but you better be able to
sing like a bird or we're all dead ducks!
Those syndicate boys out there
invented cement shoes.
Lord, who would want any?
- Can you sing?
- Fair.
We're dead.
What is going on?
Those guys are getting edgy.
That happened once before
on St. Valentine's Day.
Now get out there and sing.
- Now what?
- Man, this is a weird case.
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for coming to hear me.
Did you have a pleasant trip down?
What is this?
We gonna hear her sing, or what?
Somebody's stalling.
Stalling makes me nervous.
Okay.
For my first song, I'd like to sing for you...
this real catchy tune that... I made it up.
- What's that?
- What's going on around here?
What the hell is this?
Who called for broads?
- Who else knows we're down here?
- Nobody knows.
- It's a mistake.
- Damn straight, it's a mistake!
Let's get out of here.
- I should've never dealt with hicks.
- Who are you calling a hick?
Come on, now.
You don't want to miss the fun.
Hey, Boss. You here, too?
Welcome to Hazzard County, gentlemen.
- The sheriff and the FBI are on their way.
- FBI!
You fool!
Old Rosco put his foot in it this time.
Isn't that just the prettiest sight
you've ever seen in your life?
Come on, light, you son of a gun.
- Light it up.
- There she is.
She's trying.
There she goes.
Want to hear our new song?
It hasn't even been released yet.
Sure.
Jessi Colter sent it.
She's going to record it for real.
Oh, my Lord!
Listen!
See, I told you. All you got to do
is just keep dreaming them dreams.
English
I'm gonna nail Bo and Luke Duke.
Crazy Cooter talking.
Turkey coming right down my alley.
I'm having a picnic.
Which way to the beach?
I want those slot machines.
Now we got them.
I wish those Duke boys were on my side.
- Happy Birthday, Daisy.
- Why, thank you, Enos.
Now get her out.
Don't stand there. Go get her.
When I got up, the thing on my mind
was to do a little rabbit hunting.
- And then the hound dog runs off.
- And my car is taken.
And now we're chasing the Sheriff's car.
Ain't you glad we ain't in the big city
where life gets complicated?
Do you mind waiting till this is over.
Move it. What are you doing?
Taking a break?
If you'd tuned this car instead
of chasing women...
- we'd have already had him.
- Not with you asleep at the wheel.
- Grab that sign.
- You grab it.
- I can't. I'm driving.
- Is that what you call it?
Try not to lose him, okay.
It wouldn't be much of a chase if we do.
Bo, you drive
like my fanny whips apple butter.
You know what? I kind of admire
the way he handles that thing.
Shoot fire and save box matches!
Cooter Davenport. You ain't got the sense
the good Lord promised a turkey.
Hey, Luke. What say, Bo.
Ain't you gonna see what he did
with your car?
You borrowed my car.
What did you do with it?
I used it to run the Sheriff off the road
to make him mad. When he jumped out...
You jumped into his, right?
Why did you steal the Sheriff's car?
He impounded mine.
Seemed only fair to take his.
Using my car?
Oh, that's real good, Cooter.
I told you not to lend Cooter your car.
Cooter, do you realize what it's gonna take
to straighten all this out?
No.
Hello, bandit.
- What's that doing there?
- Maybe it was took in a raid.
There ain't no slot machines
in Hazzard County.
There is gonna be soon.
He's bringing them in.
- Who is?
- Sheriff Rosco Coltrane.
Boss, them slot machines
is coming in today.
Good. Tell me something.
Did the police get your car back?
Boss, listen, I don't think I'm getting
enough rake-off on them slot machines.
I mean, I got a lot of expenses,
with the election and it's...
Listen, I'm taking all responsibility
of putting them slot machines in.
- You owe me, Boss.
- I owe you?
Rosco, I've overpaid any debt
I'll ever have to you.
- Because you married my fat sister.
- I married your fat sister.
- Boss, about the election...
- You'd just better win.
That Honest John Ledbetter
who's running against you...
can't be bought.
You mean to tell me he's honest?
He's so crooked,
he makes you look straight.
But he's clean ruthless.
You're dirty ruthless.
Give me dirty ruthless any day.
Listen, I'm gonna beat him. I'll beat him.
Rosco, with your image right now...
- if you were the only man running...
- I'd come in second.
You'd come in second.
You get your car back
from the Sheriff yet?
Dumb Cooter Davenport.
Dumb Cooter? You're the one
that loaned your car to him.
Next time you wanna loan your car
to a fool like that, just run it over a cliff.
Save gas.
- Mr. Duke.
- Oh, howdy.
Remember me? Jill Dodson.
The orphanage fund?
Sure. And I got some money ready for you.
Thank you so much. Excuse me.
I really appreciate everything
that you've done.
- I'll just get it.
- Okay. Thank you.
Jill Dodson.
You're little Jillie Rae Dodson?
It's just Jill now.
I haven't seen you
since you ran off to college.
It's been a while.
Hey, Luke, ain't it wonderful
what hormones can do?
What are you doing now?
Since I got back I've been working
on the orphanage project.
The Health Department will close it down
if it's not completely renovated.
What about the county funds?
Unfortunately, it's not eligible
for county funds.
It was privately endowed years ago.
The money just seems
to have run out now.
So you're gonna save the old place
all by yourself?
Well, I was raised there.
Me and Luke would be glad to help out.
Wouldn't we, Luke?
- Nope.
- What do you mean nope?
It's your civic duty.
Why, at least two of them kids
at the orphanage could be yours.
Bo's always bragging on me.
You know what I remember
most about you?
- What?
- Your crush on me.
Isn't it funny how our tastes change
when we mature.
- Was that a compliment?
- You'd probably think it is.
I just don't understand you.
Why don't you wanna help Jill
with the orphanage fund?
We got nothing else cooking.
She don't do nothing for me.
I hate skinny women.
You just ain't got no taste, that's all.
I swear, if women were birds,
you'd probably date a buzzard.
And you'd date a crane. No meat.
- I'm collecting these.
- What for?
Lining the rabbit's cage.
Face up.
If we weren't cousins, I'd marry you.
That's never stopped anyone
in this family before.
You got a point there.
- Fill it up, baby.
- Take it easy.
Hey, don't you forget we got plans later.
Get your cotton-picking paws off.
Now that I finally got a hold,
I think I'll just hang on.
- Let go.
- No, it feels kind of nice.
- You okay?
- I'm all right.
Bo, why did you step in like that?
I'm gonna get charged for two beers.
Believe me, honey,
I'm not gonna do it again.
Were you going out
with that sharecropper?
- Of course not.
- Was that dude bothering you?
He just thinks he's this big-shot gangster...
because he's gonna unload
some slot machines off a fertilizer truck.
- That doesn't exactly make him Al Capone.
- Slot machines?
Don't put my business out on the streets.
Hey, dude, sit down.
You got me to mess with.
Okay. I'll mess with you.
Really. His brother's bringing in
these slot machines on a fertilizer truck.
And then that silly dude wants me
to go to the No-Tell Motel with him.
Says he'll take me off to Nashville.
See the  the works.
I reckon I've never wanted to see
anything that bad.
Not even Dolly Parton.
Can you imagine the look on Rosco's face
when he opens up that fertilizer truck...
And all he sees is fertilizer?
Hey, Bo! What say, Luke!
- How you doing?
- Hello, Cooter.
- Y'all still driving this thing on the road?
- Yep.
- I was wondering...
- No, you can't borrow it.
Where's my share
of the trucking money you owe me?
- I gave it to Bo.
- How come?
Well, you see, I owed him $50,
and y'all being kin, I figured...
We're even.
Hey, look here now.
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Brodie, we were looking for you.
What are you doing?
Hey, Mr. Dobro. You all in for a little fun?
We got our cars.
Yeah? What's on?
Sheriff Rosco.
- Go straight.
- It's all right. I know where I'm going.
I love your shortcut. Cute.
They must've just changed this since
last time a girl chased me through here.
You know, Bo,
you could lose your way on a racetrack.
Burt Reynolds never seemed to get lost.
He's got a mustache.
This is Dobro Doolin coming to you live
from the interchange.
- It ain't gonna work.
- Can't miss.
What if it does work? What are we
gonna do with all them slot machines?
I never thought about that.
We'll think of something.
Crazy Cooter talking.
Turkey coming right down my alley.
I read you, Cooter.
- Did you copy that, Daisy? Cooter's on 421.
- Ten-four.
Hit it.
What have we got here?
Leroy, let's get that girl right here.
I'm gonna steal that away.
Are you having trouble, little lady?
Yeah, I'm having a picnic.
Which way to the beach?
There ain't no beach around here.
And me with this basketful of lemonade
and chitlin sandwiches.
All right, boys.
Raise them high, and don't turn around.
Now y'all promised me
you wouldn't bring machine guns.
- Machine guns?
- Lord, have mercy.
Good luck, fellows.
You ain't going nowhere off.
He found them.
- You were supposed to get the eggs.
- I thought you were.
This time... you've gone too far.
- Now, Jesse...
- Where'd you get them?
Sheriff Rosco snuck them in
on a truckload full of fertilizer.
So we hijacked the truck.
You mean, you stole these
gambling machines and a truck.
- No.
- Yeah.
We left the truck
in front of the Sheriff's office.
What about these?
- Well, we were just thinking that maybe...
- Young man, you think again.
You know good and well that this family
don't hold with no gambling.
Now, Jesse, we've been making
moonshine for over 200 years.
Why's gambling different?
Because making whiskey
was a family tradition...
long before there was
a U.S.A. Federal Government...
to tell us that we couldn't.
And passing a law
didn't change the family ways.
- Yeah. But this is something...
- Besides...
when we were making corn whiskey,
we paid taxes on the corn.
Gambling's a vice.
How are you gonna tax vice?
Now, then...
I'm going in there
and I'm gonna collect my eggs.
When I come back out here...
I don't wanna see anything
but hind ends and elbows...
as you two boys are loading them there
machines on that there truck.
And don't go selling them at a profit.
That'd be wrong, too.
What do you think?
I think I'm tired of you
always getting us into trouble...
and me having to think a way out.
We got to change his mind.
That'd be like reversing a buzz saw.
If we can't sell them,
we're just gonna have to give them away.
Like a charity or something.
We're gonna reverse that buzz saw.
Uncle Jesse...
we're fixing to change your mind.
Or rather, Luke is.
- Tell him.
- Well, Luke?
Can we keep those slots if I show you
that all gambling ain't bad?
No way.
Now how about if all the proceeds
from those machines...
went to the orphanage?
You just found a way.
The Lawrence Welk Show.
I want those slot machines.
They've been missing three days.
That ain't my fault, Boss.
They set up my drivers with a half-naked
female woman up on that highway.
Anybody'd stop for that.
You'd better get them back
before word gets around...
or you're gonna be out with the voters.
- And you.
- And me.
Better not hit too hard
or the whole orphanage is gonna fall in.
- Hi. You startled me.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.
- What's that?
- Money.
- What's that?
- Rudy.
He's my helper.
- You wanna get a soda pop?
- Sure.
- So, here's your money.
- You're kidding.
- I never kid about love or money.
- But how...
It was donated
by some very civic-minded people.
It's not much, but it's a start.
- I'm gonna collect from them every week.
- That's wonderful!
I knew it. It is my money you're after.
Everybody said it was my body.
- Incredible.
- My body?
- Your ego.
- Thanks. I've been working on it for years.
Look. Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the money, really.
It's just that I know
this is only a game to you.
A game?
Bo, this project is very serious to me.
For the two weeks I've been back,
I've fought the rotten county politics...
the Health Department, everybody,
to try and save this place.
The only reason
we're being closed down...
is because Boss Hogg
controls the board and wants the land.
- What does Boss want the land for?
- A shopping center.
This was my home.
The best possible any orphanage could be.
You mean well,
and any other time it might be fun...
but I just don't have time for your cute
country shucking and jiving right now.
I do like a woman salty.
- You haven't been listening.
- Sure I have.
You been away to the big city...
and now you've come back
to save the old homestead.
- Look, l...
- Well, while you were gone all that time...
I was here fighting
that same rotten system every day.
- Look...
- Now, I live here. I choose this life.
Not because I don't know no better,
but because I believe it is better.
And I'm gonna fight anything or anybody
that pollutes the well where I drink.
Saving this orphanage is just part of it.
- I didn't mean...
- And another thing.
If you think I'm doing all this
to make a play for you...
well, would you grow up?
Because believe it or not...
when I make a play on a lady,
I don't have to give her money.
Although, it does keep her hands busy.
How am I doing?
Now, you walk me to my car
or the next money I collect...
you're gonna have to come
and get it yourself.
- What are you doing, son?
- Squirting flies.
I hate kids.
- Where did you get that?
- We got two of them, Sheriff.
I know you got two of them. I can see that.
We wanted more
but the other clubs had taken them all.
When you say others,
you're talking, like another club?
- The Ladies Aid, the Hunting Club, the...
- Holy smoke.
All the clubs are going great.
You ain't gonna cause a fuss,
are you, Rosco?
I'd be very unpopular if you did.
No. I'm gonna cause no fuss, Harvey.
But I'm the Sheriff.
I'm supposed to know these things.
- Now tell me, where did you get it?
- The Duke boys, Bo and Luke.
Bo and Luke Duke?
They get 30% and we get 70%...
Thirty! Heck, I only get...
Rosco, if you pick up some more slots
in a raid...
could we have them?
We need some new carpeting bad.
Is that her?
Yeah. That's her.
- Now, you swear?
- Yeah.
Rosco, if you know them Duke boys
got our machines...
why don't you throw them in jail?
I will, son. I will.
When I get enough evidence.
You? Since when?
Since when elections are coming up.
Get out.
- Hey, Sheriff.
- You're gonna have to come with me.
I'd love to. But I've gotta get myself
to work. I'm gonna be late.
You don't understand.
I mean I'll have to arrest you.
- Oh, my Lord. What for?
- Hijacking. That's what for.
Damn.
Follow that car!
- You're kidding.
- Move!
- Faster.
- I don't want to get no ticket.
From who, you jackass?
Stop!
Put the window down.
Hey, again.
If you two don't take the prize.
Now, chasing around, risking your own
probation and prison is your business.
- Now we didn't mean...
- But Daisy.
How many times have I said to you,
"Boys, look out for Daisy"?
And how many times have you said to me,
"We will, Uncle Jesse."
And what do you do?
You get her throwed in jail.
Now, just wait a minute.
It isn't always that way.
Daisy's the hope of the whole clan.
- Thanks a lot.
- The family line ends with Daisy.
The chance of you two producing
a family rates right up there...
with hogs producing beef.
For 200 years...
the Duke family had the whiskey craft.
The government took that away from us.
Then we had the land,
and The Depression took that.
Now all the Duke family has left
is what it started with, and that's family...
and Daisy is family.
Now get her out.
Hold it. Now, Enos, you can tell me.
Any change?
Hang in there.
- Hey, Daisy. How are you doing?
- Great.
I'm writing this whole new song
about this enriching experience.
Boy! Jail cooking really puts on
the weight, don't it?
Luke, I've only been here overnight.
And stuck in the slammer
today of all days.
- It's her birthday, you know.
- It is?
- Happy Birthday, Daisy.
- Why, thank you, Enos.
Jesse sent along this birthday flower
for your hair.
That's sweet.
I brought you these
change of clothes to cheer you up...
since you're stuck here
in that waitress outfit.
Better check it out.
Make sure a shotgun ain't hidden there.
I better let y'all visit. No tricks now, okay.
- Bye, Daisy.
- Bye, Enos. See you at supper.
Now, listen up.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Rosco...
but the only thing you've done
to get back those slot machines...
is arrest a woman in a bikini
for hijacking a load of fertilizer.
- Right?
- Right, Boss.
But that's exactly what's gonna get
those machines back.
You mean, you know where they are?
The Duke boys have put them all over,
in all the civic clubs.
- The Hazzard Cotillion, The Ladies Aid...
- Ladies Aid?
Hot damn.
I wish those Duke boys were on my side.
You don't have to worry...
because I'm gonna hit them Duke boys
where they live.
I've got Daisy, their cousin, in jail.
And they're gonna swap.
And then I'm gonna arrest them
for possession of illegal gambling devices.
- Rosco.
- What?
I got me three medals in two wars...
and the only time I get scared
is when you get smug.
This feels kind of awkward.
The ground gives your back
natural support...
and strengthens your arms.
This is the way beginners learn?
On the ground?
No. But I finally got you lying down.
- Why'd you take up bow hunting?
- I didn't have no choice.
Luke and me are on probation
and can't own no guns.
So it's either use the bows or throw rocks.
- At what?
- At game.
See, when we run low on food,
we have to go hunting.
Jesse, he don't take kindly to
no government assistance.
He'd rather starve.
Are you going to the orphanage picnic
on Saturday?
Well...
You have to come.
It's the money you and Luke collected
that got us rolling.
Saturday?
Yeah. That could turn into
a real barn burner.
Bo, may I ask you something seriously?
Where is all that money
really coming from?
It's so much, and it's always in quarters.
Look, the true source
is a very prominent man...
who'd be real embarrassed
if everybody knew.
- He's a philanthropist.
- He's been called everything.
We still have a long way to go...
but if it hadn't been for him,
we couldn't even begin.
I'd love to thank him.
Well, love me. I'm the go-between.
- Bo.
- Yeah?
Why do you always try to be funny?
Well, because... you scare me to death.
We might get complicated.
- Would it be easier if I said I was leaving?
- Leaving?
A job. This was only temporary.
Damn. Why didn't you tell me that?
- Is it important?
- Sure it is.
I don't know why...
but I always think that the world
ticks on my schedule and then...
- I really hate that you're leaving, Jill.
- Why?
Maybe because you do scare me,
and believe me, not many women do.
- How much time we got?
- Well...
Enough.
- Hazel?
- Yeah, what do you want?
I'm sorry to be such a bother,
but I have to go to the little girls' room.
Again? I got other things to do, you know.
You're an angel.
- I hate to be such a bother.
- You're a real pain, sweetheart.
I'll just be a minute.
Hazel, honey, I know I'm a pest,
but that light's not working.
Wake up, birthday girl.
Sheriff, I got bad news.
- Quiet. I'm having my lunch.
- Daisy's gone.
- What did you just say?
- Daisy's gone.
Don't stand there. Go get her. You, too.
- Get a roadblock.
- It wasn't my fault.
You couldn't keep a canary in a cage.
Sheriff, there she is. Right here.
Judas Priest on a pony!
She's got my car again.
Come back, Daisy! Good God, Daisy!
- That boy's fast.
- And he drives good, too.
Hey, fella. You ever considered a career
in law enforcement?
Look, Enos, we're willing
to forget what happened.
It ain't your fault you're on the wrong side.
Wrong side. Me?
You know Sheriff Rosco
brought in them slot machines...
and that was wrong.
Yeah, I know.
I don't sleep good at night knowing it.
But it's just as wrong for you
to steal them and make money.
Enos, your daddy ran moonshine.
So did ours.
Did you ever know us
to mess with gambling?
- Then why'd y'all do it?
- You'd never guess.
We did it for the Sheriff.
- You're right. I'd never guess.
- You see, it's a long story.
It all started about four years ago...
And while you're letting
those prisoners escape...
old Ledbetter there is kissing those babies
and winning those votes.
Don't you worry about it,
'cause I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna nail Bo and Luke Duke.
Nail them.
Rosco, before you start
building any crosses...
just remember those boys
are very popular around here.
You better be sure you have the evidence.
There'll be no railroading in my county
this close to elections.
I happen to know that those boys
are bringing in two broken slot machines...
and I know where and I know when.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- How good is your information?
- It's good.
In fact, it's my deputy.
They made a fool out of him.
Boy, he's anxious to get even.
- Sitting ducks. All set.
- That's a roger.
- Coming at you, Sheriff.
- They're all mine.
- They're headed for town.
- I'll come in the other side.
- Hey, did you see that?
- See what?
The bait shop.
Having a sale on worms and crickets.
Well, if he don't sell them now,
he's gonna have to feed them all winter.
- They're right in front of you, Sheriff.
- Now we got them.
Hang on, cousin.
I got them.
I got you. This time I've got you.
You have been gotten.
Read them their rights.
"Welcome, Sheriff Rosco"?
How can we ever thank you
for all that you've done!
Hey, kids, now don't be...
I know we promised not to tell,
but she drug it out of us.
Besides, we figured people had
a right to know who saved the orphanage.
You wait till Boss Hogg
finds out it was you.
Oh, Rosco, you old softy.
We knew you'd be too modest to show up
to the celebration, so we tricked you.
Enos here helped.
I had you all wrong
about the slot machines.
I'm mighty proud
to serve under a man like you.
Okay, Enos.
