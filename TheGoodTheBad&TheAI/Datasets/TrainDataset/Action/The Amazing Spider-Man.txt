PETER:
Five, four, three,
two, one.
Ready or not, here I come.
Hey, Dad?
Dad!
RICHARD:
You'll stay with Aunt May
and Uncle Ben for a little while.
I wanna go with you.
No.
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches
and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.
RICHARD: Mary. Come on, come on.
Oh, God.
Dad.
Be good.
Sony.
Morning, Flash.
FLASH:
Good morning, Parker.
Meet the son
Of the governing man
I was born
With blood on my hands
Hey. It's, uh, Peter, right?
Mm-hm.
I really like your photos.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Uh, listen,
are you busy Friday night?
Uh...
Cool. Uh, can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?
You know, I really wanna
frame a good one
for his birthday.
That's really nice of you. Wow,
that's such a nice thought. Um...
Yeah, I'll have a look
at the old, uh...
The old schedule.
Okay.
MAN:
Parker.
Yes, sir?
You want to keep that skateboard?
Yeah.
Keep it off the ground.
Sure. Yeah.
Wheels up.
Like that?
That's it.
Okay.
STUDENTS :
Eat your vegetables,
Gordon. Come on!
Come on!
Hey, Parker, come on.
Get a picture of this.
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.
BOY: Come on.
Gordon, don't eat it.
Take the picture.
Put him down, Flash.
Take the picture.
Put him down, Eugene!
STUDENTS:
Aw...
Hey, man.
STUDENTS:
Oh!
Come on!
Get up, Parker!
Get up!
Come on! Come on!
Get up!
STUDENTS: Ooh!
Still not taking the picture.
Stay down, Parker!
Who wants one more?
One more! Huh? Huh?
Flash!
Flash,
we still on for after school today?
My house, 3:30?
I hope you did homework.
Last time, I was...
disappointed in you.
Okay, move.
No, how about we go to class?
Hm? How about it?
FLASH:
Whatever.
I thought that was great
what you did.
It was stupid,
but it was great.
You should go to
the nurse. You might
have a concussion.
What's your name?
You don't know my name?
No, I know your name.
I want to know
if you know your name.
Peter.
Parker. Peter Parker.
Okay. Okay, good.
I'd still go to the nurse though.
You're Gwen, right?
Gwen Stacy.
All right.
PETER:
Hey.
MAY:
I'm making
spaghetti and meatballs tonight.
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?
Oh, my God.
What's up?
What happened to your face?
Oh.
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.
It's all right.
MAY:
Ben Parker, don't you even
think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.
My bowling trophies.
MAY:
Oh, well, then, by all means,
leave that box in my kitchen.
What happened to you?
MAY: He fell.
Why you kids
ride those things,
I'll never know.
Because it's stupid and dangerous.
Remember when we were stupid?
No.
Trust me, we were.
PETER: All right. Good to know.
Where's the flood?
BEN:
Follow me. I'll show you.
PETER: You serious?
BEN: Yes.
All right.
BEN:
It's the condenser tray.
Too much water for the condenser
tray or the heat exchange tubing.
This has got to be the fill line.
That's the only thing
that makes any sense. Heh.
Can you fix it?
No, not tonight. I'll go by
the hardware store tomorrow.
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.
How's the other guy look?
Come on. I know
a right cross when I see one.
Yes or no? Do I have to
call somebody's father?
No, no.
All right.
Well, I wouldn't tell
your Aunt May.
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.
Before you come up,
see if
there's anything else worth saving.
Okay.
BEN: Plumbers don't fix appliances.
MAY: Yes, they do.
BEN:
They fix pipes and pump things.
If you ask them to...
BEN:
I forgot all about that thing.
It was your dad's.
Yeah.
He asked us to keep it safe.
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old
kid need with a briefcase?
And guess who sold it to him.
I don't know.
BEN: Your mother.
That's how they met.
PETER:
He asked you to
keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.
Yeah, I know.
Who's that?
Do you know who that is?
BEN:
Some guy who worked with
your dad, I guess.
Just take this off the table,
all right?
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.
Now.
All right.
Go on.
RICHARD:
I need you to be a good boy.
Where are you going?
There's something, uh,
your mom and I have to do.
What is this?
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."
Yeah, one sec, one sec.
Come in.
You okay?
Yeah. What's up?
Oh, my God.
You look just like him.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
Listen, um,
I don't have much education.
You know that, Peter.
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.
What I'm trying to say is
I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.
And I know we don't talk
much about them.
Yeah, it's all right.
No, it is not
all right.
I wish I could change it,
but I can't.
Curt Connors.
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.
They worked together
for years and they were close.
But after that night,
we never saw him again.
He never even called.
Not once.
Go figure.
She's pretty
Uncle Ben.
What?
You're a pretty great dad.
Excuse me.
PETER:
What?
Oh, uh
Can I help you?
I don't know.
I'm here to see
Dr. Connors.
Right.
You'll find yourself
to the left.
You are here for the internship?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
You'll find your badge
to the left.
Oh.
Having trouble finding yourself?
No.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay,
Mr. Guevara.
WOMAN :
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn,
the Oscorp Tower houses
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defense, biomedical
and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.
GWEN:
Welcome to Oscorp.
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior
at Midtown Science
and head intern to Dr. Connors.
I'll be with you for the
duration of your visit.
Where I go, you go.
That's the rule. Remember that,
all will be fine.
BOY: Come on!
If you forget that...
BOY: Listen!
Look, listen.
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara
is here.
Just tell them
Rodrigo Guevara is here!
My name's Rodrigo!
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.
Shall we?
Come around this way.
Good afternoon, Gwen.
Dr. Connors.
Welcome.
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.
INTERNS: Ha-ha-ha.
I'm not a cripple,
I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.
That's reptiles, for those
of you who don't know.
Like the Parkinson's patient
who watches on in horror
as her body
slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration
whose eyes grow dimmer
each day, I long to fix myself.
I want to create a world
without weakness.
Anyone care to venture
a guess just how?
Yes.
Stem cells?
Promising.
But the solution
I'm thinking of is more radical.
No one?
PETER: Cross-species genetics.
Person gets Parkinson's
when the brain cells
that produce dopamine
start to disappear.
But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.
If you could give this ability
to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...
She's curing herself.
BOY: Yeah, you just have to look
past the gills on her neck.
And you are...?
He's one of Midtown Science's
best and brightest.
Really?
Second in his class.
Oh.
Second?
Yeah.
Sure about that?
I'm pretty sure.
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in
the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.
Nice meeting you all.
If you'd like to gather round.
WOMAN :
Hi.
we endeavor to explore
exciting new methods...
What are you doing,
"Rodrigo"?
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing here?
I work here. I don't.
I was gonna say I work here,
but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.
You following me?
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.
Why would you be here?
I just snuck in because...
I love science.
You love it.
I'm passionate about it.
So you snuck in...?
I have to lead this tour group.
I know.
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.
I promise you I won't.
Stay with the group.
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.
PETER:
Sony. Yo.
Sony.
DR. CONNORS: We received the results
from the mRNA sequences this morning.
They were disappointing.
Define "disappointing."
Another dead end.
It's the decay rate algorithm.
And this is to be expected.
Expected?
You said you were close.
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.
He doesn't have time.
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.
Save him.
Or we'll both lose our heads.
All right, give me the badge.
Give it to me.
Sony.
Aah. Aah, aah.
WOMAN:
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean to...
I didn't... I didn't...
Get your hand off her!
I'm trying to get my...
Are you kidding?
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?
MAN 2: Hey, get him, Rudy!
RUDY: Hey!
Man, I'm sorry!
Man, are you all right?
WOMAN: Take him down!
Come on.
MAN 3:
Get him, man! Get him!
No, man, no.
Not my board.
Please, dude, don't...
Sorry!
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
MAN :
PETER:
Ah... Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Sony. I'm late.
I got...
We've been so worried.
I know. I'm sorry.
Watch out!
That's a fly, Peter.
Yeah.
I'm so sorry
I kept you guys up.
I'm insensitive,
I'm irresponsible
and I'm hungry.
Meat loaf.
Drinking?
What's this?
I don't think so.
This is your meatloaf.
This beats all other meat loafs.
Something is very wrong.
Yeah.
Nobody likes your meat loaf.
I got it.
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.
I noticed that.
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?
You could have said that
to me 37 years ago.
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?
Aah.
Oh, well
By the time they started
Showing up
I ran the risk of blowing up
These times
These times get tough
So if I stay
We're gonna see who's had enough
Peter.
Mm.
What are you doing?
I'm, uh...
Homework.
Be careful.
Sure.
PETER:
Dr. Connors.
Uh...
You don't remember me. I, uh...
The intern from the other day.
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.
I ask you to make
an appointment with my office.
I'm Richard Parker's son.
Peter?
I'm afraid
I can't help you much. I don't
know why they left or where they
were going.
Good reflexes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I read your book.
Oh?
Yeah.
It's something, you know.
So you really think
it's possible, cross-species genetics?
Yes, of course.
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.
Not just in the community at large
but at Oscorp, as well.
They called us mad scientists.
And then your father
bred the spiders
and everything changed.
The results were
beyond encouraging.
They were spectacular.
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.
Including my own.
Then it was over.
He was gone.
Took his research with him.
And I knew without him, I...
I...
I was angry.
So I stayed away from you
and your family.
And for that, I'm truly sorry.
Say...
Say it worked.
Say you got it to work.
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?
What could the side effects be?
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.
The problem was always...
The decay rate algorithm?
Right.
Right.
Can I, uh...?
Of course.
Extraordinary.
How did you come up with this?
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower
one day after school?
Yeah.
Thank you.
BOY 1:
Number one, Reggie.
Run it, buddy.
BOY 2:
Let's go, Reggie.
Rejected!
You did that on purpose,
Flash!
I should've.
You better watch your back.
Hey.
All right?
Give it up.
BOY 3:
Come on, man.
Oh...
One sec.
BOY 3: Come on, man.
Why don't you take it from me?
BOY 4:
That's right. Take it.
PETER:
Go ahead. Take it.
ALL:
Oh!
Just take it.
All right, how about this?
All right?
How about that?
BOY 5: Come on, Flash.
BOY 3: Flash, stop playing, man.
BOY 4: Take it from him!
Come on, Flash. Take it.
BOY 6:
Yo, Flash, let's go.
BOY 7: Let's go!
BOY 8: Do it, Flash.
Stop playing, man.
BOY 9: Let's go, Flash.
What are you doing?
BOY 10: What's up?
What you doing?
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!
Peter's behavior is just
unacceptable.
PETER:
They won't make us pay
for the backboard.
BEN: I don't care about the backboard.
Was that true?
What?
What I heard in there
just now.
Did you humiliate
that boy?
Yeah, I did.
But...
But what?
This guy deserved it.
Did he?
Yeah.
Is he the kid that hit you?
Is he?
Yeah, yeah, but...
So all this is about getting even.
If so, I guess you must feel pretty
good about yourself now, right?
Am I right or wrong?
Yeah, I thought so.
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours,
I had to change shifts at work
so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?
Is that understood?
Yeah.
Okay, good.
She looks familiar.
The girl on your computer.
Yeah.
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.
Don't forget Aunt May.
PETER:
Okay.
He's a character.
That's my uncle.
He's a pathological liar.
He thought you
were someone else.
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.
Right.
So.
He must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.
Touching up stuff?
Come on.
I was... I'm not gonna
answer that.
Did you get expelled?
No, no.
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.
Um, so you want to...
I don't know...?
Um...
Want to what?
I don't know.
Just, uh...
Um...
I don't know... We could...
We could do something else,
or we could...
If you don't feel like, we could...
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, either one.
Really?
Sure.
Okay.
All right, good.
Sounds good.
Cool.
Okay.
I can't right now, I can't right now.
Yeah, no.
I'm so busy right now.
I know, me too. Ugh.
But, uh, maybe, uh...
Yeah, just, you know...
Some other...
Time, all right.
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
Bye.
All right.
Whoo!
Whoo!
DR. CONNORS:
We have protein structure, rDNA,
chromatography,
transgenics testing,
that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have, um...
Human line testing over...
I remember that.
I've seen that before.
The Ganali device.
PETER: Yeah, I remember a picture
of that in my dad's office.
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even a city.
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.
PETER:
That's incredible.
Well, others disagreed. What if the
device were loaded with a toxin?
What if you wanted to
opt out? You can't
run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted
that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.
You can imagine my envy.
We're trying to harness
this capability
and transfer it
into our host subject:
Freddy the three-legged mouse.
Enter the algorithm now.
Need to take that?
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Okay.
Check.
See what I'm trying to do?
DR. CONNORS: Preempt the proteins.
PETER: The immune response.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey.
Vitals normal.
DR. CONNORS:
Extraordinary.
And thank you.
DR. CONNORS:
Meet Fred and Wilma,
our three-legged
mice.
Here you go.
PETER:
Hey, buddy, I got you.
Okay.
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.
Human trials aren't until
next week.
There.
Hey.
Hey, I thought you, uh...
Didn't you forget something?
What?
Now, don't answer that, but I'm
glad to know it's working.
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.
Be a man.
Get in there and apologize.
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I, uh...
Honestly, you don't have
to apologize to me. It's your...
BEN: The hell he doesn't.
Ben.
Look, I'm sorry,
I got distracted.
Oh, he got distracted.
Yeah.
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone
in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station
because you got
distracted.
Ben, sweetheart, honestly,
I am completely capable
of walking home...
You will not defend
this boy!
I'm not defending...
BEN: You are!
Listen to me, son.
Yeah, go ahead.
You're a lot like your father.
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing,
but your father lived by
a philosophy, a principle, really.
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people,
you had a moral obligation
to do those things.
That's what's at stake here.
Not choice.
Responsibility.
That is nice. That's great.
That's all well and good.
So where is he?
What?
Where is he?
Where's my dad?
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?
Oh, come on, how dare you?
How dare I? How dare you?
Where you going?
Peter, come back here,
please.
Ben, leave him alone for
a little while. He'll be all right.
Peter!
Peter?
Peter!
MAN:
It's $2.07.
It's $2.07.
Yeah. No, I know.
Yeah, you're holding up
the line. No.
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.
What?
You can leave
a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars
to take a penny.
It's store policy.
You're holding up my line.
I don't have 2 cents.
You can't afford milk, step aside.
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?
We're talking about 2 cents.
Just step aside, kid.
Really?
Yo, not cool, bro.
Hey, man, stop!
Somebody stop that guy!
Hey, kid, little help?
Not my policy.
Somebody stop that dude!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Somebody stop that dude!
WOMAN 1: Oh!
Hey!
PETER:
Oh, God, oh, God.
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.
Call an ambulance!
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.
Oh, God, oh, my God.
Oh, God.
No.
Oh, Jesus.
OFFICER: Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.
No, I don't know him.
OFFICER: I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives
are on it. We'll see
what they turn up.
Okay.
Can I have that?
Sure.
There's one other thing.
He has a star
BEN: Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately
Hey, Parker.
Not today.
Come on, I just want to talk.
It feels better, right?
Look, your uncle died.
I'm sorry.
I get it.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Peter.
Unh. Get...
Stay away from him.
You understand?
PETER: Hey!
Stay away from Joey.
Hey!
You like beating
on girls?
You like beating on old men?
NICKY:
Hey, pal,
keep walking.
You're in the wrong place.
When were you in Queens?
Unh!
I asked you a question.
Nicky, no!
That the gun?
Unh!
You gonna kill me too?
WOMAN:
Hey! Stop it!
MAN 1:
Hey, get off!
WOMAN:
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!
MAN 2:
Back up!
WOMAN:
This guy is crazy!
MAN 3:
Get him!
MAN 4:
Get back here, man! Get him!
MAN 5:
Follow him!
MAN 6: Go around, man!
MAN 7: I'll follow you!
MAN 8:
Go, go, go!
There he is!
Can't get away!
OFFICER: He has a star
tattooed on his left hand.
MAN 9:
Oh, yeah?
Come on!
NICKY:
I know what you look like!
You hear me?
I've seen your face!
MAN:
Is that all you got?
Just take it, take it.
MAN: Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders,
Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning
to understand all the potential
industrial applications.
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred meters
Aah! Mother...
WOMAN: Attention, all units in the
confines of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30
Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s,
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.
MAN:
Hey.
You got a description?
OFFICER:
Well, no, he wears a mask.
A mask?
Most of his victims
are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.
MAN: Help me, somebody!
Arrest me!
Get me out of here.
WOMAN:
Hey, look!
Spandex. Spandex.
Everything
spandex.
BOY: Extraordinary velocity
vector is a function
of both mass and acceleration.
Aw, come on,
you know better than anyone
the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.
BOY: It doesn't affect frequency, but
it's totally a factor in momentum.
Hey, Aunt May.
Yeah. Eggs?
Organic, got it.
Ahem. In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars,
don't dress like a car thief,
man.
What are you? You a cop?
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?
You know, you're...
You've got a mind
of the true scholar, sir.
I was going more for
the guys who do the luge.
Good thinking.
Get out the window.
There you go. You got it.
Whoa.
Crotch!
Just let me go.
Is that a real knife?
Yes, it's a real knife.
My weakness,
it's small knives.
Just let me go.
Anything but
knives! Oh, it's so simple.
That was cool.
What is this?
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.
Let me go!
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.
Knock it off, man. No!
Come on, let me go.
Stop it!
That isn't funny.
It is kind of funny.
Help!
Shh.
This could've gone
a lot worse.
Now hold still.
Oh!
Boys in blue here.
Yo, I got him.
Freeze!
He's not going anywhere.
Don't move.
You serious?
Who are you?
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.
Freeze!
I just did 80 percent
of your job. Huh?
And that?
That's how you repay me?
OFFICER:
Hold it right there!
Woo-hoo!
Well, that was fun.
Bus! Hey there, everybody.
MAN:
What are you doing?
Whoo!
Hey, watch out.
I'm swinging here.
I'm swinging here.
Woo-hoo!
So 38 of New York's finest
versus one guy in a unitard.
Am I correct?
You don't have to wait up
for me.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Where were you?
I was out.
Did you get the eggs?
Nope. Forgot the eggs.
I'm gonna get them now.
No, you most certainly
will not.
Not at this hour.
Look at me, Peter.
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.
Peter. Where do you go?
Who does this to you?
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.
Please tell me.
Aunt May, please,
please, please go to sleep.
I can't sleep. Don't you understand?
I can't sleep.
Peter, listen to me.
Secrets have a cost.
They're not for free.
Not now, not ever.
DR. CONNORS: Cross-species
genetics is finally working.
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.
RATHA:
It's a miracle.
No, it's hard work
and promise.
It's a step closer to the primate lab.
He doesn't have time for every little step.
Little?
I just mean he can't wait.
Well, he'll have to.
Unless he wants to
be a lab rat.
That's not what
I'm saying.
DR. CONNORS:
So, what are you saying?
You have to start human trials.
Now.
No, I don't, and no, I won't.
Well, then he's going to die.
People die.
Even Norman Osborn.
We are not finished.
Human trials?
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.
I might think the Veterans
Hospital is a place to start.
You've gotta be kidding me.
I don't think I am.
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.
About 15 years late.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Richard Parker wore it well.
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.
I had nothing to do with that.
Is that what you told his son?
I don't know what you're saying.
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?
I'll remind you what happened.
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.
The clock is ticking,
Dr. Connors.
I, um...
I won't.
Fine.
The formula is ours now anyway.
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.
I'm shutting you down.
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.
Your toys can be
taken away too, you know.
Right, Freddy?
Hey.
Hi.
How's it going?
Where you headed?
Monday, B track.
Oh, it's Thursday.
It's Thursday?
What happened?
What?
Your eye, it looks bruised.
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...
Maybe I got a rash or...
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?
Mm-hm.
Do you like branzino?
Like, a fish.
Mm-hm. No, no.
I know. I know.
Well, if you want,
you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.
My mom's making branzino.
So...
It's apartment
that pan down.
I don't know why I... Heh.
I'll remember it.
Oh, okay.
Hi. Heh.
How did you get out there?
The fire escape.
Your doorman's intimidating.
It's 20 stories.
Yeah. It's all right.
This is your room.
Yes, this is my room.
Books.
Shoes.
Oh, hey, uh...
I got your mom, um,
these.
Oh, lovely.
Beautiful, right?
Beautiful.
They were nice.
No, they're beautiful.
I'm sorry.
No, it's impressive. They
actually held together very well.
I'm gonna keep these.
Heh.
You have your suit in there?
My Suit?
It's for dinner.
Are you gonna...?
Are you gonna wear that?
That's, um...
Hey, hon.
You must be Peter.
Dad, this is Peter.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Dinner's ready.
Hope you like branzino.
Who doesn't?
DR. CONNORS:
Is he there?
EMMA: I'm afraid not, doctor.
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.
No. He can't, Emma.
You have to stop him. He...
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?
Bridge! Take the bridge.
All right, we'll do that.
Hey, you all right
back there?
You tweaking,
man?
Just drive.
Okay.
HELEN:
You're having trouble there?
The head goes on the other...
Help Gwen's friend
with his fish.
PETER:
Oh, I...
I got no idea.
First time.
Branzino.
HELEN: George.
Tell us about your day.
Did you catch that spider guy yet?
CAPTAIN STACY:
No, we didn't catch him yet.
But we will. He's an amateur
who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.
He's clumsy,
he leaves clues,
but he's still dangerous.
He's assaulting people?
I'm not sure.
I mean, I saw that video
with him and the car thief, and...
I think most people
would say that he was
providing a public service.
Most people would be wrong.
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.
So why wasn't he then?
Let me illuminate you.
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run
the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?
You've heard about that in school?
Yeah.
CAPTAIN STACY:
Good.
He didn't know you had a plan.
You seem to know
a lot about this.
Know something we don't?
Whose side are you on?
I'm not on anyone's side.
I saw a video on the internet...
Oh.
You saw the video on the Internet.
Well, then the case is closed.
PETER: Well, no.
If you watch the video...
Maybe send you a link?
It looks like he's trying to help.
On the Internet he's being
made out to look like a hero.
No, no.
I'm not saying he's a hero.
What are you trying to say?
He's trying to help.
He's trying to do something
the police can't.
Something the police can't?
I don't know.
What do you think we do?
Sit around eating doughnuts
with our thumbs
planted up our asses?
George. George.
Daddy.
Up your what?
HELEN: Howard.
He stands for what you stand for.
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.
CAPTAIN STACY: I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.
Okay? I wear a badge.
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same,
like he's got some son
of personal vendetta.
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.
Let's get some air, Peter.
Dad, we need to talk.
CAPTAIN STACY: Yes, we do.
PETER:
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry
if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.
You're welcome.
Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.
Thank you.
HELEN: You're welcome.
SIMON: Dad.
CAPTAIN STACY: Yeah?
Well, that was something.
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.
What happened to your face?
I wanna tell you something.
Oh. Heh.
Okay.
I've been bitten...
So have I.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.
I gotta tell you this one thing
about
