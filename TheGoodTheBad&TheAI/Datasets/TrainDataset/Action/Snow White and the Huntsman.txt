ERIC: Once upon a time,
in deep winter,
a queen was admiring
the falling snow
when she saw a rose blooming
in defiance of the cold.
Reaching for it,
she pricked her finger
and three drops of blood fell.
And because the red seemed
so alive against the white
she thought, "If only I had
a child as white as snow,
"lips as red as blood hair
as black as a raven's wings
"and all with the
strength of that rose. "
Soon after, a daughter
was born to the Queen
and was named,
"Snow White."
And she was adored
throughout the kingdom
as much for her defiant
spirit as for her beauty.
We found it
in the woods.
It's injured, Mother.
It must have
broken its wing.
Don't worry,
it will heal in time.
I'll look after it.
You possess a rare
beauty, my love.
In here.
Never lose it.
It will serve you well
when you become queen.
SNOW WHITE: Be careful
you don't fall.
I'm just
getting you an apple.
Here you go.
Thank you.
William!
William!
ERIC: The next winter was
the harshest in memory
and Snow White's mother
passed away.
The King was inconsolable.
Taking advantage
of his grief,
a dark and mysterious
army appeared
and lured him into battle.
What devil
spawned this army?
Send them back to hell!
No prisoners!
ERIC: The dark
army was defeated,
but what would soon come
to pass was far darker.
Sire!
A prisoner.
MAGNUS: Fear not,
you will come to no harm
from me or my men.
What is your name,
my lady?
Ravenna, sire.
ERIC: So enchanted by
her beauty was the King
that he forgot, for the first
time, his broken heart
and the very next day,
she would become his wife.
You're so beautiful.
That's kind, Child.
Especially when
it is said that yours
is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.
Come.
This all must be
difficult for you.
I, too, lost my mother
when I was a young girl.
I can never take
your mother's place.
Never
But I feel that
you and I are bound.
I feel it there.
Your heart.
You will be
the ruin of me.
Indeed, my lord.
I was ruined
by a king like you once.
I replaced his queen,
an old woman.
And, in time, I, too,
would have been replaced.
Men use women.
They ruin us and when
they are finished with us
they toss us to the dogs
like scraps.
What have you given me?
When a woman stays young
and beautiful forever,
the world is hers.
First, I will take
your life, my lord.
And then
I'll take your throne.
Welcome, brother.
MY queen.
ERIC: She had tricked her way into
the kingdom with a phantom army.
She now welcomed
a very real one.
William!
Snow, get out! Snow!
I can't leave!
The Princess!
No!
Get out of here! Go!
William! Don't leave me!
Father, we must go back!
We must!
No!
We've lost her!
No! No! No!
Don't leave me!
William!
Out.
Out!
Mirror, mirror
on the wall,
who is
the fairest of them all?
It is you, my queen.
Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory.
Is there no end to
your power and beauty?
The remnants, my queen.
What do we do with them?
To the sword.
Finn.
Lock her up.
One never knows when royal
blood may be of value.
ERIC: So poisonous was
the reign of Ravenna,
that nature turned on itself and
people turned on each other.
The land died
And all that time, she
kept Snow White imprisoned
high up
in the north tower.
Our Father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on Earth as it is in heaven,
Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our sins,
as we forgive those
who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Hello'?
Hello'?
What is your name?
I am Greta.
What happened to you'?
All the girls in our
village were taken.
I was trying to reach Duke Hammond's
castle when I was caught.
Duke Hammond?
Is he alive'?
Does he still fight
in my father's name?
You're the King's daughter.
The night the King died, we were
told all in the castle were slain.
And William?
Is the Duke's son
still alive?
I don't know, Princess.
What will they do to me?
Do you remember
when we were children
begging for scraps
like those wretches?
Yes, sister.
Am I not kinder?
YES.
These two were captured
leading an ambush
on one of our
supply trains.
Your son'?
Handsome.
Obviously, a debt
owed to your mother.
There was a time I would have lost
my heart to a face like yours.
And you, no doubt,
would have broken it.
lain, no!
You would kill your queen'?
Such courage.
Such beauty.
But how strong
is your heart?
No. My son.
My $On!
Leave him.
Let him return
to the Duke
and speak of the generosity
of his queen.
Out.
Out!
Magic comes
at a lofty price.
And the expense grows.
You look...
Old.
Tired.
MY Dower
fades.
I have something
for what ails you.
Oh.
SNOW WHITE: Greta?
Greta?
Mirror, mirror
on the wall,
who is fairest
of them all?
My queen,
on this day,
one has come of age
fairer even than you.
She is the reason
your powers wane.
Who is it'?
Snow White.
Snow White?
She is my undoing?
I should have killed her
when she was a child.
Be warned.
Her innocence and purity
is all that can destroy you.
But she is also
your salvation, Queen.
Take her heart
in your hand
and you shall never again
need to consume youth.
You shall never again
weaken or age.
Immortality.
Immortality
forever.
Finn!
Brother,
bring me
the King's daughter.
Did I wake you?
Are you always awake
when I watch you'?
You've never
come in before.
My sister won't allow it.
She wants you
all to herself.
I'm afraid of her.
And not of me?
No.
Fear not, Princess.
You will never again
be locked in this cell.
What does she
want from me'?
Your beating heart.
Get me out of here!
No!
Greta?
Go.
FINN: Get me out of here!
No!
Go.
FINN: No!
Stop her!
Catch her!
Seize her!
Get to the gate!
Bring her back to me!
How is it that
an innocent young girl
makes a fool
of my brother?
Armed only with a nail.
If she'd had a sword,
she would have
taken my kingdom.
"Bring me
the King's daughter,"
and you let her slip right through
your tiny little fingers.
How'?
You swore that
you would protect me!
You swore!
Now there's no one
I can trust.
No one. There's no
loyalty, no loyalty.
None, not even from you!
Where is she?
She was chased
into the Dark Forest,
where the men lost her.
She's no good to me
in the Dark Forest, lost!
I need her heart!
You failed me, Finn!
Have I not
given all to you!
Havel
not given you all?
Yes, sister.
Quiet.
I have no powers
in the Dark Forest.
You have to find me someone.
Someone who knows it.
Someone who can hunt her.
You owe me money
from my pocket
and money for the girl.
Well, you know, I seem
to have drunk it all,
but you're welcome to it
when it comes out again.
You've gone too far.
I want my money!
Here it is!
The Queen
demands your presence.
Can't you see
I'm having a bath?
Trust me on this, sister.
All right! All right!
Hey!
My brother tells me you are a widower.
A drunkard.
And one of few who has
ventured into the Dark Forest.
Aye.
One of my prisoners
has escaped there.
Then he's dead.
She.
She is certainly dead.
Find her.
Bring her to me.
No, I've been to that forest.
I'm not going back.
You will be
rewarded handsomely.
What good is gold to me
if I'm lying dead with the
crows picking at my eyes?
Why is she of such value?
That is none
of your concern.
I'll determine what
concerns me, thank you.
You will do this for me,
huntsman!
And if I refuse?
Do me the favor,
I beg of you.
To his knees.
So you wish to be reunited
with your beloved?
You do not
speak of my wife.
You miss her.
What would you give
to see her again?
You know of my powers.
Bring me the girl
and I will bring back
your wife.
Nothing can bring her back.
I can.
A life
for a life.
She can't have gone far.
All right,
do exactly as I do.
It's a bad idea.
Stay here.
Come here'
No!
Will you help me?
Please, the Queen
is going to kill me.
Sure she is.
She's going
to rip out my heart.
Quick work.
Hey.
Well done, huntsman.
Hand her over.
What do you intend
to do with her?
Why do you care'?
You want her... Hey!
Give me what
I was promised.
You did your job well.
Now, keep your word.
He'll kill us both.
Shut up.
He will.
I said, shut up.
No, no.
I'll keep my word
when the Queen keeps hers.
Where's my wife?
He's going
to betray you.
My sister has many powers.
She can take life away,
or sustain it,
but she can't bring your wife
back from the dead, you fool!
I want her back!
I will find you!
Quiet. All right?
Hey, what the
hell's going on'?
Who are you? Why does the
Queen want you dead?
She wants everyone
dead, all of us.
What makes you
so damn valuable?
You should know,
you're the one hunting me.
Forget it.
I should have never got involved
in the Queen's business.
What did I get in?
Stupid...
Where are you going'?
Getting away from you. You're
trouble, is what you are.
I need to get to the Duke's castle.
There's an army there.
Oh, the Duke's army?
Bunch of farmers and
milkmaids with pitchforks.
I know sheep that
have more fight in them.
I'm valuable.
That's why you're
here, isn't it?
If you return without me,
you're dead.
If you leave me,
I'm dead.
Just for argument's sake,
how much reward?
However much is enough.
At least thirty gold pieces...
A hundred.
Help me.
Who are you?
Maybe you should have
asked the Queen that.
I don't trust you.
I've given you my word.
I still don't trust you.
But you have a deal.
Give me that,
before you lose a finger.
She killed my brave lain
with just the palm of her hand
and then she drew a dagger
from her side with no blood.
She cannot be killed.
But there is more.
The Princess is alive.
Where is my son'?
We have word
of the Princess.
Ravenna has kept her,
all these years.
She lives?
She escaped the castle,
into the Dark Forest.
I'm going after her.
HAMMOND: We don't
know if she survived.
William!
What?
You ventured beyond the castle
walls again, disobeying my orders.
We're all that's left,
don't you understand?
I cannot afford to lose
any more of my men.
I'm going alone.
I will not lose
my only son.
You don't know
the Dark Forest.
Then I'll find
somebody who does.
I will not abandon her
a second time.
The forest gains its
strength from your weakness.
Do you drink
to drown your sorrows?
Or your conscience?
What concern is it of
yours, why I drink?
I suppose a man's
sorrows are his own.
What does a young girl like
you know about sorrow?
Don't flatter yourself.
Now stay close.
You men know the dark forest?
Load and prepare.
You ride for
Does it not trouble you
to serve her'?
Who the Queen?
I serve no one.
Especially that old hag, and any other royalty.
They're all damned.
The King and his true
queen are not damned.
The King?
He's the one that let
the devil in the door.
It's his fault the kingdom's
plunged into darkness.
From you?
You know nothing.
What? And you do?
What's a wee scrod like you
care about the King anyway?
You're barely old enough
to remember him.
The land is diseased.
Nature is upturned.
This, this is the legacy
of your precious king.
Do you need a bowman?
I have a bowman.
Kill him.
I said, do you
need a bowman?
Here, I want
to show you something.
Which is your lead foot?
If someone comes at you,
you raise this arm up
and you block, and use their
strength against them.
You're small, so wait
until they're close
and you drive it through
their heart to the hilt.
You understand'?
Do not hesitate.
You look in their eyes
and do not pull it out
until you see their soul.
I couldn't do that.
Well, you might not
have a choice.
We have their trail.
Move on. Move on!
Wait.
Is this the edge
of the Dark Forest?
Aye.
What is it?
Troll!
Go!
Run!
I told you to run.
If I had,
you would be dead.
Only demons or spirits pass through
the Dark Forest. Which are you?
We're fugitives
from the Queen.
We mean you no harm.
Where are all the men?
Gone.
Have you got
nothing to drink?
You have traveled far
and carried
a great burden.
I've had worse jobs.
Anyway,
she's not that heavy.
You don't know
who she is.
What do you mean?
Why? Who is she?
Maybe it needs a skirt,
or a dress or something?
That's nice.
How about a face?
Your mother
wants to see you.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I'd think
it was too difficult a task?
You would be right.
I didn't trust you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Our scars protect us.
Without beauty, we are
worthless to the Queen.
It's a sacrifice we made
so we could raise
our children in peace
while their fathers
are at war.
And you,
your sacrifice will come.
You must rest.
How can you desert her
when you know the truth?
Aye, I know the truth.
That's why she should be as
far away from me as possible.
Anything I ever cared about
was taken away from me.
Not this time.
She's safer here with you.
Lily! Lily, come On!
Come on!
Run, rats, run!
Find her!
Find her!
Come on!
Get in the boats!
Get in the boats!
Lily!
In there, baby.
There you go.
Come on!
NO! No!
Come on! Let's go!
No! We have to help them!
You will. Go'
Come on!
Go!
Your beauty is all that
can save you, Ravenna.
This spell will make your beauty
your power and protection.
By fairest blood
it is done.
Here. Drink, drink!
But, be warned.
By fairest blood,
this spell can be undone.
Avenge us!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're not.
I am.
You left us.
We should never
have been there.
Hey, look at me.
I'll take you to
Duke Hammond's, okay?
All right'?
You have my word.
Wait!
This is our lucky day.
Oh, no. Dwarves.
The hedge-pig I loathe most in the
world lands right in our lap.
ERIC: Come on, Beith.
Is this how
you treat a friend?
Oh! No, no, no,
you puttock.
This is how
I treat a friend.
She's pretty.
BEITH:
And who's this?
Is this an errant apprentice
or captive?
This man is helping me.
We should kill them both.
He's caused us
nothing but trouble.
Skewer him and leave her to rot.
I don't like killing girls.
I do.
Good.
Leave her alone, Duir.
He's got nothing. One silver
coin and an empty codpiece.
Two days we sat here.
What for?
Nothing.
We should have stayed by the river.
What a waste of time!
Cut us down, Beith.
I have gold I can pay you.
It's not here, it's
hidden back in the woods.
Shut your ugly mug,
huntsman.
If you had any pennies, you would
have pissed it away on mead by now.
Cut us down,
then I'll show you.
Pull the other one,
you lying dangler.
Tell them the truth, huntsman.
There's no time!
I have to take this girl to Hammond's.
She's not safe here.
Well, my little heart
bleeds for you.
We should chop them up
and feed them to the wolves.
ALL: Yeah. Yes!
Who is she?
She's worth
a lot of gold to me.
Which I am happy to share with
you stupid little dwarves.
Stop that!
Gold is worth nothing to any
of you if you're all dead!
The Queen's men hunt us!
They're very close!
Shut up!
You have love
for the Queen?
We have no
love for the Queen.
Then you fight against her?
No one fights
against the Queen.
We lost everything
when the King died.
We fight only
for ourselves!
YES.
My father was King Magnus.
BEITH: Muir,
does she speak the truth?
Yes. She is of the blood.
She is destined, Beith.
I see an end
to the darkness.
DUIR: Riders!
They found us!
If you don't cut us down,
we'll all be killed!
I don't like this, Beith.
It smells like trouble.
You'll find your weight in
gold if you out us down, now!
Shut up, Princess.
Queen's riders!
And they're coming
this way!
We'll take her,
but not him!
What?
No, both of us!
Cut them both down, Gort!
Let's get the hell
out of here!
Move it! Move it!
They're close.
Blasted fairy music.
GORT: Yeah.
Good thing there's
plenty of moss about.
Where are we?
They call it Sanctuary,
my lady.
It's the home
of the fairies.
Fairies.
Clear!
Coll'?
Clear!
BEITH: Set up camp!
Gus. Quert.
Make the fire.
Gort, your mug.
Play louder,
you whey-face,
I can still hear
them harpy fairies.
Duir, would you really
have killed her?
Yeah.
Of course.
That seat's not taken, if that's
what you were about to ask.
I want to thank you.
It's only a log.
There's no need
to thank me.
No, for before.
For defending me.
Ah. Your father
was a good man.
The kingdom prospered.
Our people prospered.
There were more of you.
Aye.
GORT: Yeah.
The men you see before you
and many, many more,
went deep into the caves.
We were noble gold miners
because we could see
the light in the darkness.
Gus. Gus?
You were just a boy,
but you remember.
When we returned
to the surface,
there was nothing.
The land was blackened.
Everything,
everyone was gone.
