Iraq has
increased the level of its oil reserves
by 24% since Saddam Hussein
was removed.
The country has 133.1 billion barrels
of extractable oil
up from 115 billion barrels
estimated previously.
- Under Saddam Hussein...
- Fucking bitch!
- political isolation meant
little new exploratory work
was undertaken.
Closer to home, with the government
way ahead in the opinion polls,
the focus of debate in
the upcoming general election today
switched from the economy
to the domestic terror threat.
The government claims
that domestic terror groups
fractured since
Osama Bin Laden's death,
and due to increased cooperation
with key Middle...
Unbelievable!
People have no idea about
the shit storm that's about to go down.
Is this thing real?
Don't play with it.
Have I lost weight?
Was gonna say you look different.
I've lost weight. I mean, I feel good.
It's 50 short.
Get her out of here.
What about my money?
Get your hands off me.
Don't touch me!
You're still fat, Harry.
- Get off!
- Bitch.
Yeah.
OK. Now.
Follow them.
Take a left here,
head to the centre of town.
I'm going in.
There's too many people.
They're gonna go upstairs, find there's
no one there and that'll be it.
No.
Give me your fucking gun.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir.
Move!
Ah!
He never stated his destination?
He gave his driver instructions
as we went along.
He never suspected
who you worked for?
No.
The Semtex?
It was taken.
I placed a tracer in one of the blocks
the night before.
The tracer went offline
when the attack took place.
We're trying to kick-start it
remotely now.
The perpetrators knew
we were gonna be there at that time.
They knew where we were going.
And you didn't stop them?
Perhaps you don't
belong here any more.
So we've no idea to whom
the Semtex was to be delivered?
No.
You and I, Charlotte, in five.
Difficult times.
He's getting pressures from on high.
You did what you could, Ewan.
Charlotte?
Present from my ex-husband.
Get that seen to and get some rest.
On my break.
I've got two minutes left.
No, I'm not smoking.
I'm not inhaling, I'm walking.
I'm out of breath
cos I had to rush back from lunch.
Tuna sandwich.
Tuna sandwich and some crisps,
and a chocolate biscuit
and a coffee, no sugar.
Hey, we gonna go for drinks? Make it...
about quarter past, yeah?
How's Dad? And the fence?
The garden fence.
Just tell him to wait
and I'll help him the next time I'm up
because his back won't hold up.
I'll get time off. It's not a problem.
I don't know when.
I'll let you know when I know.
Hey, one minute.
It's a good job. Gives me time to drink.
Think, I said think!
About whatever. I've got my degree,
I can do what I want.
Look, I've gotta go, I'm late.
Yep, I love you too.
Sorry.
See ya.
Can I help you, sir? Table for one?
Almost there.
How did you do it?
Slipped.
Doing something strenuous?
Your girlfriend will love the scar.
Sexy.
Wife.
Come back in two days,
take the stitches out.
Might still be here.
Back in a minute with some painkillers.
Yeah.
It's been confirmed
that a suicide bombing
occurred earlier today
at 12:30 in the busy
South London restaurant, Driscoll's.
With currently confirmed casualties
of 20
and with more understood
to be injured.
The restaurant was full
of lunchtime customers,
including a large meeting being held
by the 2004 Committee,
an organization which had
Middle East energy interests
and championed the Iraq war.
Three backbench MPs were members.
All are believed
to be amongst the fatalities.
The same Semtex that was
stolen was used in the bombing.
An element in Whitehall feels that
Obama's inclusive doctrine
has spread across the Atlantic
and has made us complacent.
They're pushing for sweeping changes.
If they discover that the Semtex
was being monitored by us
and that we could have stopped it...
I don't need to tell you
the repercussions for this government,
especially with the election looming.
The clock is ticking on all of us.
It's just you and I here, Charlotte.
What can you do for me?
We are here to remember
Corporal Peter Walcott Tiernan,
taken from us in the service of Queen
and country in Afghanistan.
He bravely answered his country's call,
and leaves a loving wife, Louise,
his brothers, Ian and Daniel,
and his mother, Margaret.
It's at times like these that
we must find strength and peace
in the memories
of what he meant to us,
an honorable son and brother.
He was older than his 25 years
and was the one his family relied upon
since losing their father at an early age.
He undertook his responsibilities
with dignity and strength
and maintained a strong family bond.
Remember he said
he had a trial for United?
He said he missed out
cos he was too fast.
You remember, sir?
Yeah, I remember.
Last letter I got from him, he...
He said the regiment
weren't the same since you left.
- How are you, mate?
- How do I look like I am?
Cold makes it hurt like a bastard.
I can't sleep properly.
What happened there?
Ah, some stupid accident.
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.
Thinks I'm some sort of invalid.
She can't stop fussing.
You should be thankful.
See that bomb they set off in London?
It was on the news.
It never ends. None of it.
What was the point of Pete dying, sir?
Dying in some shithole country
for nothing.
- What was the fucking point?
- What's the matter with you?
Have some respect for him,
for his family.
You got hurt, but you're here.
You're alive.
Listen to me,
we move on.
What's here and now,
that's all that matters, all right?
Go back to your wife.
If you need help,
you can always find me.
We stick together, all of us.
Have you moved on, sir?
From what happened?
Hello?
A car will be downstairs
in 15 minutes.
I'm Mark.
Baby daughter.
Take the path through the wood.
You'll find her at the other end.
Bit of a walk.
You've seen the news.
Semtex was used. You understand?
Perpetrator?
It was strapped to his jacket,
self-detonated.
No details on who he was.
CCTV have no clear images.
There's nothing left of him.
We're bound by procedure.
In this situation,
we cannot afford those constraints.
This is off-reservation.
It's why you're at my home.
I want you to find who's responsible
and stop him
in whatever way you feel fit.
Let it be done quickly.
It'll be you and Mark.
He's young but capable.
Very good with a gun, I hear.
I want it low-tech, old trade craft.
If you get caught,
I don't want evidence.
I'll supply technical backup
and the sweep and clean.
No luck yet with the tracer
you planted in the Semtex
but we did find something curious
of your man Harry.
No bullets in his automatic.
Any thoughts?
Maybe.
You're my hands on this, Ewan,
my conscience.
Wipe it clean.
No loose ends.
Where's Harry?
Fat cheapskate owes me money.
Harry's dead.
I want you to think carefully,
more carefully than you've ever thought.
Was there anything...
Anything unusual happened
in the last few days?
Anything you know
but you're not telling me?
Dead? What are you talking about?
I'm leaving.
You took the bullets from his gun.
Why?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have time to waste.
I know you know something
and I'm not leaving until you talk,
- one way or another.
Talk.
I don't know anything. Please.
By the time I'm through with your face,
nobody's going to wanna look at you,
let alone pay to fuck you.
He said nothing would happen.
What?
- He told me it was just business.
- Who did?
- A client.
- Which client? Tell me about him.
- Young guy, said his name was Paul.
- Paul?
I saw him regular for two months.
He wanted to know stuff about Harry.
- What stuff?
- What he was up to, his routine,
he paid me extra.
I told him useless stuff-
who he met, what time, his routine,
- just useless stuff.
- What about the bullets?
Said it was a joke to take them out.
Said Harry showed up with a gun.
He wanted to teach him a lesson.
Where did you meet him?
What did he look like?
At his house. Expensive place.
Short hair, brown, slim,
could pass for Greek or Italian
but he was an Arab.
- How do you know?
- I have Arab friends.
I know what the language sounds like.
Heard him speaking it on the phone.
You know his address?
When the bomb went off,
there was a flash,
and then there was lots of smoke.
A lot of glass flying. There was
a lot of people on the ground.
Horrendous, huge explosion...
I don't know.
I just felt it more than anything else.
Ash.
Jesus.
How have you been?
Good, yeah. You?
Yeah, I'm good.
Do you, uh, live around here?
No, I'm just... Coffee.
It's good to see you.
Yeah, you too.
I have to go. I'm late for something.
Listen, um... Do you have a number?
If you... If you give me yours, I can...
- If I can get this thing to work.
- It's all right, give me yours.
I'll tap into this.
Um... OK.
- Got it.
Look, I have to go.
I'm really late for something, but...
Really nice to see you again.
Horrific.
What we saw was devastation.
It was just horrific, really.
It was like being in a war zone.
It was crazy and I heard screams.
People like, kind of injured,
and their clothes were all, like...
Everyone was just covered in dust.
We have with us
today Crispin Jones,
who is an intelligence expert.
Crispin, what are your thoughts
about the recent spate of bombings?
Well, I think it's too early
for us to speculate
as to who's involved, but, um,
the hallmarks of the bombing
really do point
to home-grown Islamic terrorism.
Cowardly way the bombs were lit
in a public place,
nature of the types of explosives,
and it seems to be...
Off you 9°
Hi.
Can I use your bathroom?
Yeah, you know where it is.
So why are you here?
You always said if I needed any help
I could speak to you.
I need money.
Can I get a drink?
Yeah, sure.
Get your fucking hands up!
- You got me into this!
- Fucking whore!
- Get your hands up!
- Fucking bitch!
- Get away from him!
- You got me into this!
Check outside.
- Hello?
-  Why'd you hang up?
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.
Why didn't you move your lips
and something would have come out.
Listen, are you free to meet?
It's a bright,
sunny morning in London town,
with highs in the early 20$...
Coming up, lots of new music
and a few other surprises in store!
It's nine minutes past eight...
Time for some music.
It's Blur, from their last album,
Think Tank.
I love this song.
Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head
for the whole day now.
Shooting star?
It's going out in beautiful flames.
You remember I said
that I was late a couple of weeks ago?
Yeah.
Well, I came on the other day.
Aren't you relieved?
I'm disappointed, actually.
I mean, obviously, that kid would have
my good looks and massive brain.
When do I get to
meet your mum?
Well, you'd have to put
some clothes on first.
You haven't told her
about me, have you?
Is it cos I'm not a nice Muslim girl?
She doesn't know
that you're a bacon-eating,
lager-drinking sex maniac?
John Major signed a peace treaty
with Sinn Féin
because the IRA's violent actions
forced him to.
Gerry Adams changed from a terrorist
to a politician but it was violence
and legal action that forced the change.
Not one lawyer was involved.
Gerry Adams is a murderer.
This is a law class.
It's not a political forum for you to...
Actually, in today's context
he is recognised and accepted.
He's being invited to have tea
with the Prime Minister, for fuck's sake.
Ash, just keep it civilized.
I'm sorry.
Cos he matched them with violence.
I mean, look at Israel,
created through a violent struggle
and now it's an internationally
recognised state.
In America, the American forefathers
fought the British,
beat them hands down,
and now what are they?
They're the biggest
superpower on this planet.
Why? Because violence
is the supreme authority
all authorities derive
their power and legitimacy from.
Law is completely irrelevant
in the face of true force.
That applies to any country.
And what's your country?
Ash.
Can I have a word?
You may be smart
but you are close to failing.
It's a I'm afraid.
I can handle this.
Ash, do you really want
to practice law?
- Ash?
- Don't worry.
"All right, I'm coming out.
"You, coming out now.
"Any man I see outside
I'm going to shoot.
"Any son of a bitch
who starts to shoot at me,
"I'm going to shoot them, too.
"Then I'm going to kill
all his friends, his family,
"and then second generation,
everybody.
"Then I'm going
to burn their house down."
It's Unforgiven, you know?
Clint Eastwood after he's killed
everyone for murdering his friend,
played by the noble Morgan Freeman.
Oh, man, great actor.
I'm Nabil. You are?
- I'm Ash.
- Ah, Ash.
Like cigarette ash.
It's not your real name, huh?
Don't be ashamed of who you are, huh?
Short for Ashraf, yes?
You look how
they've killed Muslims, huh,
- in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo.
And now they've invaded Iraq
for the bloody oil.
Come to one of my meetings.
Here, take... Take, uh...
Take some of these, yeah?
Take five, you give them
to your friends.
You have friends, don't you?
Your face!
Hey!
Oh, Allah wouldn't be pleased!
Sorry, what did you say?
- What were you guys doing in there?
- Just a little pick-me-up.
Were you doing that shit with him?
Ash, don't start. I'm not in the mood.
Come on, come on.
'  Oh!
I"'l!
You all right?
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy!
Get off me! God.
Come here.
Ash, I'm sorry.
What the fuck's
the matter with you, huh?
Trying to make me
look like a fucking idiot?
- No.
- Doing that shit with him, huh?
That fucking prick.
What were you doing
in the fucking toilets, huh?
- Nothing.
- Sucking his cock?
- I'm sorry.
- Was he feeling...
- Fuck off!
- Come on, Ash.
Just as long as you have
a fucking great time,
you know, fucking get wasted.
You don't give a shit about anything,
do you?
- You don't care about anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.
Listen, look, I'm sorry, OK?
I'm sorry.
I promise I won't do it again.
This is the last time, OK?
You know I love you.
We must rise up against
these Western pigs
who occupy our lands.
Who come at us with smiles
to take what's ours
and turn us against each other.
In this so-called democracy,
if you speak up about
Muslims being slaughtered,
you're an extremist. Huh? Yes?
Yes, yes.
But if you are passive, huh?
Silent, easy to control, huh?
You're a good Muslim. Yes?
Just like a dog, they throw you a bone.
But keep you on a leash, ah?
You know the type of Muslim
I'm talking about.
He's so ashamed of who he is.
He gives himself a Western name.
He tries to think and feel
like his Western master.
Live like him, be him!
You say to him...
My friend, you say to him,
"Let's stop the murder of Muslims."
And he would say,
"You ignorant foreigner,
"you want me to jeopardize
my nice life and my country, huh?"
This is the fool who wears
an England football shirt,
and says,
"Ah, we won the match." Huh?
And the man next to him,
in the same shirt,
he calls him a Paki, hmm?
A nigger.
Ask yourself, "Who are you?"
Really?
All right, matey?
I'll just get a couple of pints, please.
How's Kate?
She was off her head last night.
I've never seen anyone drink
or snort as much as that in my life.
An animal.
So how come you weren't there?
She not tell you she was out?
I wanted her to suck me off
but she passed out.
It's OK, hey, no problem.
It's all right, my friend,
it's no problem, no problem.
Come, come, move, come.
It's all right, it's all right, a racist.
Bastard. Come on.
You know, it felt good, what I did.
You know, sometimes to earn respect,
we have to do things
we wouldn't normally do.
You know, people like us
have to do that
just to get the basic respect
most people take for granted.
In Afghanistan, hmm,
we had to fight to earn respect
and freedom from the Russians.
You were there?
What was it like?
What happens on the battlefield
is between you and God.
I am here now.
God didn't will it for me
to enter paradise.
But I'm content, you know?
Contentment is a state of mind.
Like Palestine.
You know, law is not for me.
I don't want to be part of any hypocrisy.
Look.
Would you call them
dignified human beings, hmm?
They're just having fun.
My friend, no, we are not like them.
What time is it?
You have a rough night?
My head.
Listen, Kate.
I don't think we should
see each other any more.
Why?
Same shit every day.
You don't know when to stop.
I'm 23, for God's sake.
Look, I'll stop when I'm older.
I'm enjoying myself.
Will you just relax, for Christ's sake?
Right, I don't want to see you
any more. OK?
I don't want this any more.
You can go back to sleep if you like.
Oh, what, just like that?
Black and white?
It's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?
You want to end it with me and...
you end it, just like it's nothing.
You want to leave? Just go.
Get over yourself.
Ash!
The terror level
stays at "critical"
and some are calling London
a city under siege.
The government announced today
that it would proceed as planned
with the general election.
We ask whether it would be best
to postpone the election
in the interests of public safety.
The government, however, may feel
that an alteration to the election date
would be seen as a victory for...
Nice place.
Swish.
Present for my baby daughter.
You have to check for small parts.
Ever wondered why they do it?
Too simplistic to think
they just hate us?
What does that have to do
with this girl?
Look at her.
Have you served for your country?
No.
I fought over there.
To stop this from happening here.
Again.
Didn't stop. They're not going to stop.
And neither will I.
I'm going to find every one of them...
and send them to the death
they pray for.
Hello?
There's a file for you
at the drop box in 10 minutes.
Come on.
You hesitated before
you gave the safe signal.
Is someone following you?
Maybe.
I couldn't say.
Did you walk here?
Circuits?
I've been down Holborn,
Chancery Lane, Oxford Street.
- Two hours.
- Shall I report it?
I'm not sure.
Bombings are making us all nervous.
Don't worry about it.
They found the receipt in Paul's house
for two pay-as-you-go phones.
Paul had one. The other was used
two hours ago from that building.
The phone was used
to call Afghanistan.
He's in there on his own.
It's not registered to anyone.
It's an abandoned council property.
We can go in round the back.
We go in and take him.
Shots to the head.
Anything else allows him to detonate,
understood?
Yeah.
Come on.
- Get up!
- Ah! No!
Don't! Stop! No!
Where's your jacket, hey?
- I said don't shoot!
- Face the wall!
I said face the fucking wall!
- Face the fucking wall!
- I said don't shoot!
Close the door. Go!
Let me just talk to you, man.
I said let me talk to you!
How many people were you gonna kill?
Just give me a second, please.
Get on your fucking knees!
I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?
- How many?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Just listen to me and calm down,
and me and you can...
An eye for an eye, yeah?
I'm just like you.
I'm just...
I'm just like you, all right?
You're nothing like me,
you fucking animal.
Please, don't!
I can do what I want to you.
I can do anything I want.
You know that?
Please don't!
Move!
Let him burn.
Oh, fucking hell.
The tracer on the Semtex
was kick-started.
This will take you right to it.
Who was the man I just killed?
You have to go now.
Mujeeb Ajmed. Pakistani parents,
At the precise moment
he was signing on, squatting in the flat.
Not a bomber.
What other options
were you faced with?
Considering the past days' events,
your past...
what you've been through,
what we've all been through.
You were not there.
We have removed all traces of you.
It was a squat in a dealer's hangout.
What's done is done.
How did he get the phone?
Stolen, obviously, from Paul.
Do you have anything
that would link you with this incident?
Just his jacket.
Get rid of it.
This is no time to doubt.
Innocent lives are at stake.
Finish it.
Do you remember Ian?
The stoner who used to steal
our milk and top it up with water.
Oh yeah, he used to piss
into a water bottle
cos he couldn't be bothered
to walk to the toilet.
Yeah, I saw three
full bottles in there once.
So what have you been up to
all this time?
Oh, nothing much, just been drifting.
You didn't get into law?
No, it wasn't for me.
I always thought you were
gonna be a high flyer.
Have your own firm.
Not like me. I always knew I'd end up
working in the dullest law practice ever.
Why don't you just quit?
- It's not that easy. I can't just...
- No.
- ...leave my job.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So are you, um...
Are you married or anything?
No, not married.
Relationships, yeah.
There was this one guy
but that just ended.
No, I loved him.
He just wasn't interested.
Wasted four years of my life.
Lost it a bit, actually.
Still managed to keep my job
at the law firm.
And then I went crazy wanting kids.
Never met anyone.
You?
Nothing serious.
How's your mum?
Is she still trying to get you
to marry a nice Muslim girl?
No. She, um... She died
a couple of years ago.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You look beautiful.
I hardly ever think about those days.
Uni feels like another life to me.
What you doing?
We, uh, we organise activities
for young Muslims.
Camping in the Brecon Beacons,
rafting, paintball, team bonding.
And we combine these
with religious teachings.
Now, as a successful Muslim
businessman, you want your staff...
- Your Muslim staff.
- ...to be of good character, right?
Thank you for coming to visit me
and for making this offer,
but I'll have to pass.
I don't involve myself
in my workers' private lives.
I'm not a religious man,
but faith is a...a personal thing.
What they do in their own time
is their business,
and that's what's great
about this country.
But thank you.
Great about this country?
Man, this is the same country
that has destroyed so many cultures.
All our cultures.
- Thanks for your time.
- No problem, thank you.
Oh, Muhammed.
Hey, you look well.
Salam aleikum.
Yeah, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.
Oi!  Hamed!
Don't shoot me! I'm only...
Hey, good to see you.
How are you?
Good to see you, good to see you.
- Salam aleikum.
- Yussif, yes?
- Yes, yes.
- Which one is this?
This is the one we send to the boys,
but it's the truth.
You're doing excellent work, very good.
- Thanks.
- Now come, we need to talk, huh?
- Yep.
- Shall I come with you, bruv?
No, just, uh, finish up.
He wasn't interested.
No problem. Ah, there...
There are other business people
we can approach, you know?
It's a matter of, uh, getting their
young workers to join us, huh? Huh?
You know,
this gym was a very good idea.
You're doing very, very well, my friend.
Very, very well.
You want to do more, yes?
What have you got in mind?
A test of your will.
And then we shall see about you.
This is Sergeant Glenn Conlon.
Ex-military with
intelligence associations.
He has served in secret prisons
all over the Middle East,
killing and torturing people we know,
you know, people close to us.
He's not in the services any more,
you know, he's...
bought a farm.
Stables, you know,
he wants the quiet life.
He's retired from killing
and humiliating Muslims.
We don't retire.
We don't forget.
There is a man coming from the
Middle East. An important man.
He lands next week.
You'll go and meet him.
You'll do as he asks.
But he needs your assistance.
This is a foreign country to him.
You'll need another man.
You have someone?
Yeah, Yussif.
Good.
You're going to help
our friend with Sergeant Conlon.
Ash raf?
Peaceful streets.
lngleezee.
What?
Englishman.
He gets up at 8:00AM,
goes to the barn,
cleans it for an hour
and then goes to the stables.
Who lives with him?
- Nobody.
- No wife?
No.
When he comes out of his house,
follow him into the barn.
Show him the gun.
We come out, we beat him,
tie him, take him.
You do everything like I tell you to,
you understand?
A knife for you.
No fork.
