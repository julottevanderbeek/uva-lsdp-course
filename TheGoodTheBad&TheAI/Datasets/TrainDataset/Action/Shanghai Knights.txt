Boxers!
Not one step further.
The keeper
of the lmperial Seal .
Just the man l was looking for.
A woman .
You Chinese are
very progressive.
A gift from an old friend .
Wu Chow.
He wanted me to send
his regards.
Father!
Father.
The seal .
You must get it back.
l promise.
Give this. . .to your brother.
What are you reading?
Oh .
"Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy."
lt's incredible.
Roy's just taken out
the Mummy's entire army
of zombie confederate soldiers,
and he only had one bullet.
That's impossible.
Oh , no, it's not.
Roy figured out
the physics of the canyon
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall .
Nailed each zombie
through the heart.
What about the Shanghai Kid?
He was captured
and knocked out on page 10
while he was polishing
Roy's pearl handles.
Don't you worry.
Roy's about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice.
Those stories are all lies.
No. See?
lt says right here
on the back.
"Author Sage McCallister bases
all his stories
on firsthand accounts."
Sorry, sheriff.
No princess.
Every day you meet
the noon stage.
Every day it's the same story.
She's not coming back.
Pei Pei's married to her work
in San Francisco.
Modern woman .
Sheriff, you got a parcel .
Hey, maybe it's from her!
No. lt's from my sister
in China.
l know.
l know.
l must go.
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.
Uh , sheriff,
that stage is headed east.
lsn't China kind of west
of here?
l'm not going to China.
l'm going to New York.
Roy invested my money.
ls it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the Ritz
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women
at his every beck and call?
That's the old Roy.
He's married , settled down .
Trust me, he's changed .
So there we were.
Completely outnumbered .
He didn't have to tell me
we didn't stand a chance.
So l send the Shanghai Kid
and the princess out the back.
Poor Shanghai Kid .
He was so frightened .
He forgot to thank me
for saving his life.
l'm used to that.
Now, l returned to the front,
and l counted to three. . .
and l burst out of the mission .
Pearl handles blazing .
Lead flying everywhere.
And not a single bullet
touched me.
-No!
-Yeah .
What happened
to the emperor's gold?
Well , we divided it up.
l insisted on giving my share
to the lndians.
The savages?
Please don't ever call
those noble people savages.
lf being proud of your body
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage,
then , by God ,
you're drinking with a savage.
And that is what you call
a French toast.
You are so sophisticated ,
Mr. O'Bannon .
Whoo!
Who's up for some more bubbly?
Reach for the sky, Roy.
Say that again .
Reach for the sky, Roy.
Chon Wang !
You sly son of a gun !
-Look at you !
-Look at you !
-What brings you to New York?
-My share of the gold .
Refresh my memory.
What gold?
The emperor's gold .
Okay, now, that gold is in
what the Wall Street pros call
a long-term investment.
We can't touch it
because it's building .
l need it tonight.
You just got here.
Let's celebrate.
No. l don't have time.
-You just got to the big city.
-My father's been killed .
Chon , l'm . . .
You need the money to get back
for the funeral?
No. l must go to England .
The ship leaves tonight.
Your father died in England?
China. My sister followed
the murderer to London .
Wait. Murderer.
l'm a little bit mixed up.
Let me see if l can get
the facts straight.
You have a sister? You never
told me you had a sister.
ls she pretty or does she look
like you? Be honest.
Roy, l need my money!
l don't like
that tone of voice.
You think after all we've been
through l'd stiff you?
l'm doing pretty well
for myself.
Yeah .
-l'm sorry, Roy.
-That's okay.
You're going through
a really tough time right now.
You got to be more trusting
of people, okay?
Look at me.
lt's Roy.
The couple at table 5
is ready to order.
Do you work here?
No, l don't work here.
lt looks like these guys
are wearing a similar jacket.
Roy, here's your cut
of the tips.
lt's the craziest thing .
l guess because
l come in here so much
they're mistaking me
for a waiter.
-lt's embarrassing .
-You lost the gold .
-Not all of it.
-Where's the rest?
l have one word for you .
Zeppelin .
l need my money now!
-Easy, easy.
-
Will you do anything
for this money?
Yes.
l must leave tonight.
Okay.
Take this key.
Go to the room .
Get cleaned up.
Your old pal Roy's got a plan .
Go! Come on !
Howdy, big boy.
What?
There's a woman in there!
She wants me to sleep with her.
Of course she does.
l told her the Great Wall
ain't the only big thing
coming out of China.
-Why did you say that?
-So you could get the money.
l will not sleep with women
for money!
Why?
l'm gonna sleep with her
for money.
Chon , just go in there
and do your business
and think about your sister
in England .
-What?
-Roy!
-Duty calls.
-Roy!
Good evening , Mr. Mayor.
Where are they?
Who?
My daughters.
Roy?
Roy, you got trouble.
Roy!
l got to check on something .
l'll be right back.
Chon , new plan .
We got to go.
-Chon , what are you doing?!
-
l'm fixing her back.
Put her down ,
you decadent Philistine.
Hey, Chon , come on !
Let's go!
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
Come on !
l don't understand .
What's going on?
l don't have time to explain .
All you have to know is there
are bad men after us. . .
but l'm in the right.
-Roy.
-You gotta trust me on this.
Okay, look.
l'm in a transitional phase
in my life.
-But. . .
-But what?
You want to know the truth?
l'm a little lost right now.
l see you .
You've got a sense of purpose.
But look at me.
l'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.
Where's the future in that?
So what's the plan?
You were always
my compass, Chon .
The plan .
You ask me the right questions.
The plan?
The plan , l think,
is to find the right woman .
Raise a lot of children
and teach them values.
No, Roy.
The plan to get out of here.
Okay, the plan .
Here we go.
-Cops! Cops!
-They can help us.
No, no.
Chon , not these cops.
These are dirty cops.
They take advantage of people.
Now, if they stop us, remember,
l'm not Roy O'Bannon .
Who are you?
l'm your friend Smoky Desperado
from the West.
And who am l?
You . You're Benihana.
-Benihana.
-Yeah .
You teach crippled children yoga
here in the city.
-You go first.
-No! Why me?
Because you blend in , okay?
Now, go!
Don't let them see you !
Benihana.
Hey! Hey!
Ooh .
Psst! Chon !
Come on .
Stop wasting time.
You !
Chon , l found our ticket
out of here.
RO Y:
We're on our way.
Looks like old Roy
came through again .
Just like old times, Chon .
MAN :
Check over there!
-Over to the alley!
-That way!
Yeah , just like old times.
Will you forget about the gold
for a second?
You're gonna have more money
than you ever dreamed of
when that first zeppelin
takes off.
Why do l always believe you?
What do you mean?
You're lucky l didn't invest
in that ridiculous
automobile idea.
Yeah , that's gonna make
a lot of money.
What's that?
Doghouse.
l'm in the doghouse.
Oh , come on , Chon .
Look, l'm sorry l lied .
l just didn't want to
disappoint you .
That's exactly what l mean .
l can't take that look.
l learned it from my father.
That's how he used to look
at me.
What did your dad do?
Was he an lmperial Guard?
No.
Much more important.
He was the keeper
of the lmperial Seal .
That's what l love
about China.
Everybody's job description
sounds so damn cool .
The seal has been symbol
of the emperor's power
since Genghis Khan .
lt has been passed down
from one emperor to another.
My family have been watching
over it for 12 generations.
My father and l used to
skip stones across the moat
and talk about a day
l would follow his footsteps.
l was his only son .
lf l'd have been there,
l could have protected him .
lt's not your fault.
You were 3,000 miles away.
What's with that little box?
My sister sent it to me
from my father.
-There's a message inside.
-What's it say?
lt's a puzzle box.
l don't know how to open yet.
What do you mean?
Get a hammer and smash it open
so you can see what it says.
l must have patience.
By the time
l'm able to open it. . .
l will be ready to read
the message.
Come on , Confucius.
That's the corniest thing
l've ever heard .
Let me see this.
You know what?
We're gonna go to England .
We're gonna find
your dad's killer.
We're gonna get
that seal back.
There's no reward
for this, Roy.
Who said anything
about a reward?
l'm talking about friendship,
loyalty, honor.
Okay?
Thank you , Roy.
And l hear England is ass soup.
A lot of pretty girls there.
First order of business,
my Lords. . .
is a report from our esteemed
friend Lord Rathbone. . .
who recently returned from
a diplomatic mission to China.
Fellow Lords. . .
l'm afraid l bring disturbing
news from the Orient.
The opium wars
have ravaged the land .
The emperor's enemies
are organizing .
The most vicious
are the Boxers.
A godless band of rebels
who murder without discretion .
China is not well .
l have brought back an envoy
who should give us some insight
into the inscrutable mind
of the Chinese.
ls he mad?
Given to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria by the emperor
in recognition of her
Outrageousness!
Long live the queen .

BO Y: Jack the Ripper
strikes again !
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.
Howdy, partner.
The English are not
very friendly.
They're just sore losers.
What did they lose?
A little thing called
the American Revolution , Chon .
Never heard of it.
l'll give you the highlights.
They came over
with about a million men .
We had a bunch of farmers
with pitchforks
and beat 'em like a drum .
Hey! l'm walking here!
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road !
Bunch of amateurs.
These people don't get it.
Hello, ladies.
Look at you .
What? l'm not supposed to
notice a pretty lady?
l thought you wanted to
settle down and have a family.
l do, Chon .
l just hope l can .
Why not?
Sometimes l worry that
all the damn horseback riding
l did out in the West,
bouncing up and down on the
hard saddles might have made it
so my salmon don't swim upstream
the way they're supposed to.
What?
l might be shooting blanks.
Oh .
Don't say anything .
Roy, it's okay.
Some people are not meant
to have a family.
l've always had such a special
connection with children .
The little ankle biters.
Hey, watch it,
you little punk!
Pardon me, guv.
You gents lost your way?
Yeah . We're looking
for my sister.
She's staying
at 32 Oxford Street.
l know it well , guv.
Me old man used to live there.
Can you show us the way?
Well , memory's
a little dodgy.
But l'm sure for a bob
l could get you there.
What do you take us for?
Okies from Muskogee?
Go sell your bullshit
someplace else.
We're not buying .
Thanks for the tip, guv.
Hey! l stole that watch
from my uncle!
What?
This way.
Come here,
you little rubbish eater!
What did l tell you about
poaching on our turf, Charlie?
l'm on the straight
and narrow. Honest.
What's this, then?
After l'm through
beating you . . .
you're gonna wish you never
ran away from the workhouse!
CHON :
Leave the boy alone.
Bloody tourists!
Get your noses out of it!
Do whatever you want
to the kid . . .
but that's my watch .
Well , there's a load of us
and only two of you .
So piss off!
Easy, fellas.
You've lost one war this way.
Don't make
the same mistake twice.
Come on !
After him !
Hey!
MAN : There he is!
Get him !
We've got him now.
Move in , lads.
Boys, boys, wait, wait!
MAN : Come on ! Get him !
Up the bloody ladder!
Hey! Hey!
WOMAN :
Oh ! Watch it!
Hey.
Ah !
Come here, you !
Cool .
Move it!
You !
Did you see that?
lt's okay.
Okay?!
l call that one
my kung pao chicken .
l clotheslined the sucker.
MAN :
Come on , get back!
Clear away!
Make way!
l think you gentlemen should
accompany me back to the yard .
This isn't a yard !
lt's a jail !
Roy, calm down .
Unbelievable.
Wait!
Someone's coming !
-Let me handle this.
-l'm gonna handle it.
The English aren't like you .
They don't get all emotional .
Touchy-feely.
Do me a favor.
Park the kung fu .
Let me do the talking .
Come here.
Let me give you a hug .
Ooh !
l've been after that
Fleet Street gang for two years.
Then you two come along
and bring them down
in a single afternoon .
Brilliant!
Now, um . . .
Oh , that's my watch !
Yes. A street urchin
turned it in .
The little punk better not
have scuffed it.
-l hope your luck picks up.
-What do you mean?
l deduced from your watch
that you'd hit a rough patch .
He has.
How do you know?
lt's an investigative technique
l've developed .
l can deduce intimate details
about an individual
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects.
What else can you tell?
The owner of this watch
is a bad gambler
and a lousy shot.
Although he's cheated death
several times. . .
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic
and futile search
for purpose and respect.
Oh , yes.
He has a penchant
for loose women .
Wow. That's amazing .
l'm sure it's a very popular
party trick
at birthdays
for small children . . .
but it doesn't quite play
with adults.
Just to set
the record straight.
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted
to loose women .
Loose women
are attracted to me.
-You're Roy O'Bannon?
-Yeah .
The famous Western folk hero?
Have you heard of me?
Have l heard of you?
l've only read "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy" five times.
lt's fascinating .
l want you to meet
the Shanghai Kid .
Oh , yes.
The faithful Chinese sidekick.
l'm not a sidekick.
Those stories are all lies.
Come on , don't be bitter.
l can't help what
Sage McCallister writes.
lf there's anything l can do,
l'm at your service.
We're looking for my sister.
She's staying at this address.
Can you take us there?
Oh , dear.
l think you'd better come
with me.
Lin .
Wang .
lf you don't mind ,
l'll just wait outside.
lntroduce me.
Oh . This is Lin ,
my baby sister.
Roy O'Bannon .
Pleasure.
You never told me your sister
was such a. . .
beautiful lotus blossom .
What'd she say?
No, no, no.
No talking about me
in your native tongue.
Why are you in jail?
l followed the man
who murdered Father.
And?
l found out where he live.
l snuck inside his house
and tried to kill him .
lt's my duty to find
Father's killer.
No, it is mine!
l'm the one who promised Father.
But l'm his only son .
When you abandoned us
for America. . .
Father said he had no son .
What?
Whoa. Time out.
Time out. Come here.
The detective's a fan .
Why don't l play
the celebrity card?
We'll get her out that way.
-Okay?
-Okay.
Don't worry.
l'll get you out.
Everything's gonna be okay.
ln fact, l'm gonna give you
my good-luck playing cards.
Just ignore the naked ladies.
Wang !
Have you opened Father's box?
Not yet.
She tried to assassinate
Lord Rathbone
whilst he was taking
afternoon tea.
He's 10th in line
to the throne. . .
Her Majesty's
favorite cousin . . .
and the finest swordsman
in England .
So, of course,
the press had a field day.
The story actually knocked Jack
the Ripper off the front page.
Artie, Lin is not a killer.
She's just a really,
really, really hot. . .
confused Chinese girl .
Maybe if l agreed to sign
a few autographs
and talk to some of my fans
here in England . . .
do some type of charity event,
can we get her out that way?
l'm afraid
that's out of the question .
What will happen
to my sister?
She'll go to trial ,
probably be locked away
in an institution
for the criminally insane.
The tabloids have already
dubbed her "Loony Lin ."
l thought it was rather catchy.
At the time.
Do you have any notion
what would happen
if we were to be seen
together?
Since your return , l have yet to
lay eyes on the lmperial Seal .
l'm hosting a jubilee ball
at my country estate tomorrow.
Be at the stables
at midnight.
As requested ,
a token of my esteem .
This is where you get out.
l hope there will be
more trust between us
when l'm emperor
and you are the new king .
Wow. Buckingham Palace.
Look at that, Chon .
That's where the queen lives.
Hey, look at this guy.
CHON : He's a royal guard .
He has a very important job.
l used to be just like him .
No, they're nothing like you .
They're a tourist attraction .
You can make faces at them ,
insult them . . .
and they can't move a muscle.
-Here. Watch this.
-Roy. . .
No, it's okay.
Hey, buddy,
your shoes are untied .
That is the biggest damn beaver
l have ever seen .
Roy, stop it.
The queen !
Look! The queen !
She's mooning us!
He almost went for that.
My friend and l just came over
from America.
You might have heard of it.
We run your jerkwater country.
Come on , you gonna take that
from a colonial?
Roy, stop it.
l bet you are one hell
of a damn poker player.
No hard feelings.
Huh?
RO Y:
They can't do that!
You're not allowed to do that!
Shouldn't have touched him .
You scram , you little punk.
l've got friends
at Scotland Yard .
l'll give you up
in a heartbeat.
You get your watch back?
Don't worry about my watch .
Go on .
lt's a knockoff.
What are you talking about?
My uncle stole this watch
from President Lincoln .
lt's a priceless
family heirloom .
Not according
to the pawnbroker.
You should not steal .
lf l don't steal ,
l don't eat.
Who showed you how to do
all that kicking and punching?
My father.
Have you ever heard of those?
They're parents.
You don't 'cause you're
a little orphan .
Now, go on .
You're cramping our style.
Oh , this country blows.
You need a place to stay?
Come on in
and warm your dogs.
RO Y:  You can
get into a lot of trouble
breaking into
a place like this.
That being said , well done.
You just ate
the last chocolate.
Course l did .
You gotta look out
for number one.
l could really
get used to this.
Living the life
of a country gentleman .
Maybe doing
a little painting .
Let Lin play in the garden
with the children .
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
Who's Lin?
Lin's the most beautiful woman
l've ever met.
She's gonna be the savior
of the house of O'Bannon .
Chon , check out the threads.
All l'm missing is the
loyal hound curled at my feet.
We are wasting time.
We must find Rathbone.
What do you think
l've been doing?
Sitting here drinking
expensive hooch?
Refill .
l've been working on a plan .
Now -- Whoa.
Don't slosh the brandy.
-lt messes with the bouquet.
-Sod off.
l'm trying to teach you
a skill set.
Help get you off the street.
-Bartenders make big bucks.
-Roy!
The plan .
Thank you , Chon .
lf we find the seal . . .
we can prove Rathbone
killed your dad .
lt's the old Hail Mary play.
l also have a version
where we dig a tunnel .
Hey!
Bloody catapult.
Jesus Christ!
-You don't need a catapult!
-Who asked you?
You don't interrupt grown-ups
when they're talking .
"Lord Nelson Rathbone requests
the pleasure of your company
at the jubilee ball
in honor of Her Majesty's
Sounds good .
lt doesn't address security.
They're not gonna let
Chon and l
waltz into the castle.
All you need is
a proper disguise.
l do like a good disguise.
l look like a fool .
What?! You're a maharaja.
That's lndian royalty.
-But l'm Chinese.
-lt's the same thing .
Bob your head a little bit.
Gives you more
of a lndia-royalty flavor.
That's good .
Good show, good show.
Good show, good show.
-Cheerio, cheerio.
-Cheerio, cheerio.
What do we do
when we see Rathbone?
Kill him .
No, okay? No!
You're gonna be civil ,
'cause we don't have the seal .
No seal . No Lin .
No family honor. Okay?
Be cool .
Okay, we look great.
Let's enjoy this party.
-Whoa. What are you doing?
-l'm going inside.
-The place is haunted .
-You're the harness man .
You get back at the carriage.
You wait in case we need
to make a quick getaway.
Go on .
Man your post.
You don't always get
what you want.
Why are you so mean
to that boy?
l see a lot of myself
in that kid .
lt's kind of freaking me out.
Come on .
Your name, please, sir.
So l can announce you .
Sherlock. . .Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes.
Which province do you represent,
Your Highness?
Nevada.
May l present
Major General Sherlock Holmes
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.
How are the security
arrangements?
Oh , everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord .
And if l may say so. . .
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.
l speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard
when l say that no matter how
far you are from the throne. . .
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.
Okay, here's the plan .
We're gonna get
a little chow.
Then we're gonna
sneak out of here.
-Start looking for that seal .
-Okay.
-Spotted Dick, sir?
-What?
Spotted Dick.
Can you believe this guy?
l'm trying to get
something to eat.
He's asking me
if l got the clap.
l think
he's offering you food .
Oh . Spotted Dick.
Oh , no.
l think l'll pass.
l'm not really
a dessert man .
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.
l might try
one of these sausages.
A little smoky Joe.
Mmm ! This is good !
l thought the food here
was supposed to suck.
The haggis is fresh
from Scotland , sir.
lt's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.
l'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.
You should try the quail .
l shot them myself
this morning .
How do you do, Your Lordship?
Very well , thank you .
l'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.
But l haven't been to lndia
since '81 .
l spent most of my time
in the Orient.
l hear you've just returned
from China.
You are well-informed ,
maharaja.
lt is my dream
that the Chinese people
will follow lndia's example and
one day embrace British rule.
The Chinese are very proud .
They place family and honor
above all else.
Well , l'm sure
we can break them of that.
lf you'll excuse me,
l have a matter to attend to.
Until we meet again .
Patience.
l'm proud of you , Chon .
We must find the seal .
What do you see?
Shh , shh , shh !
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.
That was my father's!
l must avenge his honor.
Hey, slow down , tiger.
Slow down .
Quit going all Chinese on me.
Where is he?
Damn it. Remember
your puzzle box. Patience.
Okay, there are no windows.
We just came in
through the only doorway.
That leaves one explanation .
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy"
how the zombie king got away
when l chased him
into the pharaoh's tomb?
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.
Help me lift some stuff up.
Roy!
The painting .
lt's looking at me.
-Look!
-Oh , yeah .
Looks like it's looking at me.
That's great.
No, real eyes.
Moving !
That kid got to you ,
didn't he?
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.
That's a technique
that an artist uses.
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term .
lt's unnerving , though .
l'll give you that.
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!
Whatever you say, Chon .
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.
Roy!
What, Chon?
