Okay now,
take your time.
There you go.
Dad, Dad,
It's up here.
Slow down Sam,
slowdown.
Whoa...
We must show this
to the Sheriff.
Come on, let's go, go!
Move.
Go, go, go!
Sam..
Are you all right?
I'm scared!
Wha? wha...
Watch out!
Dad!!!
Dad?
How're you doing Dallas?
Eddie?
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I usually ride in the back.
It seems you remember you're being
with me a couple of those times.
You've got work lined up?
Why?
You hiring?
I had enough trouble convincing people
I belonged in the job...
but I'll ask around town for you.
I appreciate it.
You, uh, seen my brother?
Actually, I've been seeing
him too much.
You gotta wear the hat.
Drew, the only reason you make
us wear a hat is because
the manager made you wear a hat
when you were drunk.
Look, the only reason you got this job,
is because your guidance counselor begged me to give it to you
Yeah. I'm sure the fact that she is hot
has nothing to do with that. Huh?
I can make that delivery,
I better do it.
This is no democracy.
Make the run or you are fired.
And wear the hat!
Harry.
We keep telling you guys to stay out of here and you keep coming back.
I hate to do this , but I'm gonna
have to take you in.
Let me just get my dog.
Butch!
Butch!
Come here boy.
What is that?
Jesus!
Ah...
Sheriff, Sheriff.
Hey, Ricky.
- Hi, Jesse.
Come on in.
Can we get you something to drink?
I'm good, thanks.
Cute outfit, Rick.
Yeah, as in Halloween in October?
It's now I know who's ordered the
"Sausage Lovers".
My purse is in the kitchen.
I'm sorry.
He is such an asshole.
Yeah, well, you always know
how to pick 'em, Jess.
Well I let you know another of those secret...
I am getting ready to fire him.
Fire him.
That's funny.
So what do I owe you?
Ahh.. 53.50
Keep it.
Thanks.
I'll see you later.
Come on.
- Dale, Dale, stop it
Was that laugh you've got worth it?
Huh, no answer?
- Dale, leave him alone!
Give me my keys.
Find them in 30 minutes or less,
Asshole.
Let's go. bitch!
Let's go Jesse.
Ray, you find anything?
Nothing. Anyone parked at the turn-out?
Only Benson's truck.
Jesus, Eddie.
He usually goes out with his kid.
Dad?
Dad?
Hey, I missed you so much.
- She's so big.
-I know
- Hey
- God. I can't believe you're home.
It has been so long.
Do you want some help?
Is this for me?
You don't like them?
Are you kidding me,
these are so cool!
I'll show you how they work later.
Ok.
Well.
You've got problem with the door?
When did you get back?
Today.
What happened to your face?
We'll talk about that later.
Ricky.
- Hey,We'll talk about that later.
- No let's talk about that right now.
-Get your hands off me, get your fucking hands off
- What happened to your face?
Dale Collins and his friends jolted me.
And threw my keys in the sewer.
All right, give me the bat!
What're do you doing here.
Ricky I'm not gonna ask you again,
give me the fucking bat!
Come on,
I'll help you find your keys.
Butch, shut up!
Harry?
You better save some for me.
Oh!!!
Oh my God!
Harry.
- Mom.
- Sorry, it's bed time, honey.
I am not sleepy yet.
Molly, put those away.
It's time for bed.
I love you.
I want Dad to read it.
Ok
I love you.
See you in the morning.
Hey...
Do you remember all those times you told me,
how much you missed Mom?
It's ok to tell Mommy now.
Ok.
Hurry up.
- You want to do it?
- You're the convict in the family.
Very funny.
Help me with this, Ok?
Why don't we climb down where
they threw your keys.
So Jessie can see me climb out
covered in shit? No, thanks.
Amazing. We're gonna be covered in shit?
Take this.
- It's gross down here.
- No, I could think of worse places.
I guess nobody's home.
Is that a couch?
Yeah, it's nicer than ours.
What the hell?
It smells like something died down here.
Are you sure this is the right way?
It should be right up here.
That's the drainage.
Check down there.
That do your key's asshole.
- You got hands.
- Yes, and I'm not sticking it in that shit.
You can do it.
Knock yourself up.
Tel me about this girl.
- What girl?
- The one you got your ass kicked over.
- She's the girl.
Nobody goes around digging for
shit over just some girl, Ok.
What the hell was that?
- Relax, just a rat.
Fucking rat.
Check that drain.
I got them.
Let's go.
Sam..
Ray, head towards the bridge.
Sam, where you?
- Buddy?
- Buddy?
Sam.
Kelly, bring them in.
Where are you Buddy?
We won't stop looking for you, Sam.
Thank you guys.
Pay attention please?
Eddie.
We will start up again first thing tomorrow.
My husband and my son
are out here, somewhere.
They wouldn't stop looking for me.
Do you think that...
something happened?
I don’t know..
Why don't you go home
and get some rest.
Come on.
We need your strength.
Ok.
Ray, anything?
Negative,
I'll gonna make a final pass by the ridge.
All right, keep in touch.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.
Excuse me, Sir.
If you have seen my
husband and my son?
Ok.
Thank you.
Pardon me, I'll give you this.
This is my husband and my son.
Just keep an eye?
- Of course.
Thank you.
How is the job hunt going?
Is "breaking and entering" a special skill?
Do you have any suggestion?
I hear the bank is hiring.
Any word on Buddy and his kid?
Carrie, coffee please.
I guess you been out all night huh?
No, we called it off at 2 a.m.
- Ray didn't come home?
- Eddie, I thought he was out with you.
I've tried his cellphone.
- Carrie, listen to me.
Ray was pushing real hard.
I'm sure he's still looking.
Ray, you down there?
I cannot believe that this is Ray Adams.
I do not wanna believe it either.
You know what will it take for
man to do this?
For someone to skin a human being?
No tracks.
Nothing.
Eddie, you're in over your head.
What you gonna do?
I'll let you know when I figure it out.
- Hey.
- Hey, Jessie. Hi.
You know, you looked at me that
same way in class.
Yeah, well, the clock's  behind you.
What?
Tomorrow when you're in class, turn around.
You'll see it.
Yeah, I know its there, but we both
know that not what you're looking at.
You know, you never were a good liar.
- Do you want to go swimming tonight?
- Swimming?
- Where?
- At school.
Come on,
it will be like old times.
Old times like before
you had a boyfriend?
Yeah.
And it's ex-boyfriend actually.
He's been fired?
So, tonight, around 10.
See you tonight.
I'm closing out now Darcy.
See you when you get here.
You're all right?
If you want talk.
It's Ok.
You're welcomed to stay
with me and Cathy tonight.
Darcy's coming by to pick me up.
I'll sleep at hers.
I'll see you tomorrow.
We found Ray's body in the woods.
It was odd.
He was skinned alive.
Do you think it's got something to do with
Buddy and his kid disappearing?
I think this kind of thing doesn't happen here.
Sheriff, we have report of a small gas
explosion in the sewer at your 16th, do you copy?
Roger dispatch, notify the Fire Dept.
I will meet them there.
- Do you want some help?
- I don't know Dallas.
Come on,
I'll ride in the back.
So ahh...
How do we get in?
I've taped up the lock, after class.
I couldn't decide on which suit
I wanted to wear, so...
Now... you tell me.
Are you looking at me or the clock?
Come here.
- What do you think you're doing, Jess?
- Dale, get out of here.
Just remember, Ricky.
I taught this little slut everything she knows.
No, Ricky, stop it!
Stop it.
Dale, stop it.
Stop it, he's drowning.
What the hell was that?
Oh my God, oh my God
get out of the water.
Jess, go.
Go.
Oh my God,
Get out of the pool.
Help me.
Help me.
This side.
- Is Ricky dead?
- Why don't you go back and find out.
Come, let's go.
- Go.
Window.
Go. go.
Come on.
Help me.
Go.
Daddy.
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- What is it?
It was outside the window.
- What?
- Some monster.
Ahh...
Oh.
Come here.
Come here.
When I was your age, I used to
have these awful nightmares.
I saw it.
It was real.
See.
No monster.
Daddy!
We have to go.
Come on.
Daddy!!!
The fire's spread to the whole plant.
They have to shut down the reactors manually.
Roger that.
Dispatch?
We have to evacuate the entire town.
Call the National Guard
in Colorado Spring for assistance, Over.
Copy that.
Jesus Christ.
- Sheriff.
- Yeah?
I think you should hear about this...
- Dallas.
- Alright, thanks a lot.
- Ricky what the hell you doing here?
- I saw something came after us,
I don’t know what happened.
What do you mean something came up.
Slow down, what came after you? where were you?
- I don't know.
Where were you?
- We were at the school.
Mark, he's dead.
I think they got Nick too.
What was it?
Ricky?
I don't know.
I'm calling help.
Somebody's gotta know about this.
Eddie.
Dispatch, where's that backup?
Dispatch, come in!
Dispatch, come in.
Let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Carrie
The power's out.
Help me!
I don't think the police station
is such a hot idea.
What do you want me to do?
We do not know what we dealing with.
- Come on.
- Look out.
Sheriff.
Darcy? Darcy, what happened?
What are you doing?
Eddie, you must...
- What?
Carrie are also here.
They're so much blood.
They're all gone.
She is dead. She's dead.
Ricky, get her inside.
Get her in.
Hey, people are dying.
We need guns.
-The National Guard will be here soon.
- Not soon enough.
I can't believe I'm letting you do this.
This plan is stupid.
Let's just leave town now.
Cause we're not gonna make it without weapons.
Dickhead!
You just stupid to talk, Dale
Shut up.
Where are the guns?
- Follow me.
Here they are.
Dale, pass some bags.
Jessie, load them up.
Eddie, you got power on that thing?
Yeah, I just need some light.
Go, go, go.
Roger.
Move. Move.
What's your status.
This is Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.
Repeat, Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.
This is Lieutenant Woods, 89th Troop Command
Colorado National Guard.
Go ahead, Sheriff.
What is your location
Lieutenant, over?
We are on Main Street.
Listen, Lieutenant, I don't know what
your men is walking into.
But our situation is getting worse.
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?
- We've got a missing man.
- Hold on, Sheriff.
We've got gunshots...
It's a fucking ambushed!
What the hell's going on out there?
Pull back.
I repeat, pull back.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, are you there?
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?
We're not gonna make
it are we?
Don't shoot, take what you want.
I'm not getting killed for
We've been attacked.
Terrorists had done this sir?
I told you they would, one day.
What you guys, stoned?
Do you see that?
Are you hurt?
Come on in.
It should be safe here.
Hold on.
No pulse and breathing.
Take him straight to intensive care.
When's the light going back on?
We are on emergency generators,
until the power's restored.
Oh! I think my water just broke.
- Ohh...
-Ok.
I will find the doctor.
- You two look pretty shaken up.
- Hasn't been an easy night for her.
And what about you?
I'll live.
We're leaving in 5 minutes.
Thank you.
Where is he?
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Come on.
Mommy.
Turn back.
It's a trap.
It's a trap.
It's a trap.
Go.
Molly, took off. Run
Run Molly.
Come here.
- My God.
Fuckers...
What is this fucking shit?
What was that thing?
That's not possible.
Something's wrong.
Check the other room.
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.
What the hell?
- This is our help?
What the fuck is going on,
Eddie?
- Where are all the bodies?
- They are gonna kill us all.
We are not dead yet.
There may be weapons we can still use.
Radio.
National Guard, come in.
Repeat, any National Guard unit,
come in.
This is Colonel Stevens, US Army.
Identify yourself.
Sheriff Eddie Morales,
Guns in Colorado.
You have to help us, Colonel.
There some kind of infestation and if
And if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.
What's the Army's evacuation plan?
Colonel?
Colonel, we need immediate evac.
Sheriff, all ground routes
have been compromised.
There is an airlift, in 30 minutes
from Gilliam Circle.
Confirmed. Airlift. Gilliam Circle.
We will be there in 20 minutes.
But that's right in the centre of town.
Will be there,
Colonel.
What the fuck are you.
Everyone, get in the APC.
I'll drive.
Do you think you can
drive that thing?
I will get on the gun.
- Don't miss.
Don't crash.
Hold on.
- Why are we stopping?
- It doesn't make any sense.
Gilliam's Circle is right in the
centre of town.
We will be surrounded
by those things.
- Wait a second. Why are you saying?
- I think that the Colonel is lying.
But that is crazy.
The government doesn't never lie to people.
The army thinks about containment first.
They can't risk this getting worse.
Help is a few miles down that road,
and there are waiting for us.
Now if you won't drive us there,
I will.
Eddie, if she is right, then the only thing
down that road is more of these things.
- You're not seriously considering this?
- I'm considering whatever keeps us alive.
Which means getting out of this town.
There are only two helicopters in town.
One is at the airport..
- No, that's too far. We'll never make it there.
- The other one is at the hospital.
The people at the hospital probably
used it to get out.
That's a chance we have to take.
If you have wrong and the helicopter
is gone, we're all dead.
If I am right, they'll dead if they follow you.
There's a truck coming.
- Dallas, what the hell are you doing in there?
- Never mind that.
- You guys heading to the air lift?
- Yeah
Ok. Follow us.
We don't have much time.
Alright. Listen up.
Everybody's gotta choose right now.
We're going to the hospital
with the tank.
We all need to go the center of the town.
- That is right.
- I'm going with my brother.
- I'll go along with you.
I'm going in the tank.
Dallas, don't do this.
She's wrong.
And brother or not, he's wrong.
You're gonna get them killed.
We are running out of time, Sheriff,
We gotta move now.
Hold on.
We're coming with you.
Wait.
Take care.
I hope we're both wrong.
Lets go.
I didn't help anybody.
I was too scared.
I just watched them die.
All right, put these on.
You too.
All right, listen.
Whatever happens inside, the only person
who can't get hurt is Kelly. We all protect Kelly.
What is this, the Titanic? Screw the
"women and children first shit", man.
Look, asshole, unless you can
fly the helicopter, shut up.
Let's go.
Maybe they are all gone.
Fucking. Shoot it!
- Jesse, no wait.
- Move, now.
Jesse, wait.
Ricky, wait.
Motherfucker....
Come on.
Come on, get up.
You're gonna make it. Brother...
We have to go.
Now.
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Is this everybody?
- This is all that's left.
- What have you heard?
- The air lift will be here soon.
Clear!
- Come. Go go. You're all right?
- Yes.
Come here.
Go go.
Follow your mom.
- Come on.
- Everyone, move.
Run Molly.
Dallas.
- I'm trying.
- Are you going to use that thing?
- Hang on.
Lets go.
You got her?
Colonel Stevens? This is Gunnison County...
Requesting status on your evac,
Over.
Colonel, where's the air lift.
Sheriff, we are still 10 miles out.
Hold your position, over.
Colonel, we're here over.
God help us all.
Alright, get out of here, now.
I will buy us some time.
- I'm not leaving you.
- Get to the chopper.
You don't have to do this, Dallas.
Now. Go, go.
Come on, you
Motherfuckers!!!
Come, over here.
Come on.
Okay. Go!
Hey, come on over here!
- We're not leaving without him.
- We have to go.
He will make it.
Die.
Let's go.
Close your eyes.
- Hang on.
- Mommy.
Hang on.
- Hey, you're all right? Ricky?
- Press here, yes, hard.
Drop your weapons.
- You bastards killed the entire town.
- We're just following orders.
Put down your weapons.
We need a medic, for my brother.
Medivac is inbound.
Secure any weapons and lets
set up a perimeter.
Go, move it.
I told you not to crash.
Mommy?
Are the monsters' gone?
They are gone.
The world isn't ready
for this technology.
But this isn't for our world,
is it Miss Yutani?
