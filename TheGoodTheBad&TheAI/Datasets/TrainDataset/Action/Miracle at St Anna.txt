Darling, come back to bed.
Please. Enough.
Enrico, what kind of art dealer
specializes in Nazi art?
You Americans love work
more than you love 'love. '
My love, are you ignoring me?
Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.
The world is still here.
You and I are still here.
Yes, I love you to death.
Why don't they shut her up?
What is she saying?
Berlin can afford to pipe
that garbage all the way here
but can't give us potato soup.
Individual guns only, on my command.
We have enough ammo for an hour,
maybe two.
- You got any more biscuits?
- No.
- Or anything else?
- Not for you.
I'll give you money
for a vitamin biscuit.
Go over and beg the Blacks.
What about you? You a replacement?
I thought they were freezing
their asses off in Russia.
- So?
- You got any biscuits?
No.
They must have given you something.
If I die, you can have all my rations,
but for now, shut the fuck up!
I got a hole in my stomach.
I can't hear a thing
over that damn whore's prattling.
Stupid white man.
Arturo!
Arturo, where are you?
Beautiful.
Where did you find it?
Watch me throw it.
Little black face,
Beautiful Abyssinian,
Wait and hope,
The hour is already near,
When we wiLL be,
Close to you,
And there to give you
a different Law and a different King.
Arturo! Now, L am nine years old.
Okay, maybe I'm eight.
I'm really only eight.
A Chocolate Giant.
Help me.
I'll give you a banana, Chocolate Giant.
Use your tail, Chocolate Giant.
No, please don't leave.
Oh, my God, it hurts.
Giant, you don't taste like chocolate.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Holy Mother of God.
This shit is heavy as hell.
To hell with this.
I'm up shit's creek.
Eat.
Water.
Arturo?
Can I ask you something?
Can you tell me who I am?
My God, I've had it.
Come on, it's enough.
Yeah, let's go.
I need something to eat.
The Germans are leaving!
Push it up or I'll kill it right now.
I'm pushing as hard as I can.
Pull, pull, pull.
My goodness I'm hungry.
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.
Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.
They won't get fat on it.
Let's hope they choke on it.
Shut up, the two of you!
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,
tell us ifwe'll see him
or never see him again.
Is he still alive?
My eyes aren't what they used to be.
Come on!
So, so, so?
We can't even joke? Come on.
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.
You're the usual scoundrel!
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,
he thinks he can do what he wants.
Oh yes?
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?
The Pope?
Maybe, because it wasn't us.
And the light?
How did your electricity come back on?
Papa.
Come with me.
How did the light come back on?
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.
You would think that
after all these years,
you would treat your friends better.
What is wrong with you, Papa?
Would you tell me?
It's Natalina.
What did she do?
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.
You still going on about the same story?
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.
There's strange things going on.
My electricity returned...
from God knows where
after two and a half years.
I was going to ask you about that.
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...
for every bandit and German to see.
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.
What are you talking about?
She prays for you every day.
Know what I say?
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.
Tell everyone
that Mussolini disgusts you,
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.
Il Duce made us a world power again.
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.
Papa, Il Duce betrayed Italy.
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.
You are still so young, my child.
You don't know the ways of the world.
But you will learn.
And from whom?
From a Fascist like you?
You're just like your mother.
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts
are only good for hiding dirt.
Okay, let's go.
Germans!
It's your house.
Holy Mother of God.
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Americans?
Half.
Me sister Ida, half.
We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.
Put us together, we make one American.
Okay, wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Thank you.
Who's in charge here?
Where are the Germans?
A boy? He has a boy.
Oh, my God.
Is he alive?
Put him here.
Slow. Slowly.
Where did you find him?
On the Mountain.
Do you know him?
No, I don't know him.
But he can stay here
until he gets better.
We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.
The hospital around the corner?
The Germans are everywhere.
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.
I don't know how you got past Vergemoli.
The only way to Pietrasanta...
where the Americans might be...
is over that way,
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
What is that?
It's a legend.
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.
So he lays across the Mountain...
to protect her from the wind and rain.
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.
Legend has it that one day
he will awaken.
We should take him...
and put him to bed.
Catching up on your reading?
Yes, Colonel,
I'm informing myself about the enemy.
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.
This helps us identify them.
Who is the poet?
Giovanni Pascoli.
Do you think it's appropriate to waste
your time reading poetry?
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.
What are you planning to do about it?
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.
My men are exhausted.
We need ammo and food.
Food? You want food?
You can suck icicles in Russia...
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.
Good. Listen closely.
I have come too far to repeat myself.
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...
to him and his criminal friends.
Bandenbefehl?
Is there an echo out here?
General Kesselring's standing field
order for the Italian Republic.
At a commander's sole discretion,
for every one German soldier killed,
we execute ten Ltalian civilians.
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...
my men would kill innocent civilians.
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.
Bandenbefehl!
Bandenbefehl.
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.
And three:
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.
We are missing a Corporal...
from the 35th Regiment,
Name; Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.
We have some every day.
What's so special about him?
You and I are not here...
to question the Fuhrer's orders.
You are to send out a search party.
Find him.
Don't let him escape.
And when you have him...
get word to me immediately.
Let's go!
If I am no Longer that Lamp...
which flickers in front
of a sweet Maria.
What does that mean?
God help this poor bastard Brandt.
Whatever he's done,
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.
Mount a search party.
We have to find him first,
hold him and give him a few days...
before Pflueger pulls out his teeth,
one by one.
Yes.
I'll be relieved when this war is over.
I want to return to my family.
I've watched you grow up.
But you haven't become much.
And he can't do much.
You're laughing at me?
Of course.
Where did you get that?
So many things you want to know.
Here. Take it and eat.
Give me some, too.
Are you afraid you're not
going to get any?
Here. Grow.
Give me a chestnut, too.
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.
Hey, leave me alone.
Aren't you the dandy?
Ah, he's offended.
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?
You have to be on the lookout.
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.
I almost choked.
You wait here.
My friend.
The Americans are getting closer.
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.
They know it already, for sure.
You? How are you?
Me? I'm okay.
You?
I always have Marco's face
in front of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.
I care.
In your opinion...
when we will be in front of God,
ifwe ever get there,
is he going to ask us
for our political card?
Is he going to say, "Marco, no...
Ludovico, no.
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists. "
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?
You're asking yourself
too many questions.
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.
And then who will kill the Germans?
Hey.
Anyway, what's done is done.
Someone tell that big beast
to get out of my room.
The Boy has a fever.
He needs to eat and get some rest.
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.
Arturo.
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...
if you could only see it.
It's enormous.
No, even bigger.
Of course I saw it.
It's all made of chocolate.
You break a piece off,
and it grows back.
Yes, I did save a piece for you.
Good heavens.
Something's not right.
Someone put the evil eye on him.
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.
To where?
With the Americans.
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.
This is my house.
I have a house too.
Natalina.
What do you think?
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.
We need a Priest here.
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.
A Driest can take the Devil out of him.
My Chocolate Giant.
Can you show us a safe path?
There is no safe way.
Germans. Boom! Boom!
You know a way.
Franco was the mailman, ask him.
I'm too old.
Me?
I have to deliver the mail.
What mail, you old crazy fool?
Old crazy fool? You're the old crazy,
like your mother and your father.
What did you say?
What did my daughter say?
I have nothing to do with this.
Are you crazy in the head?
Keep out of this.
I forbid you to go.
I don't need your permission.
Understand?
You're still my daughter.
Renata. Come away.
Shove it up your ass.
Arturo said that
if you turn your head...
it will be my birthday.
I'll get toys and lots of candy.
Now, please turn your head.
Please turn your head.
Can you turn your head like this?
See?
Listen, Chocolate Giant.
You've got to do what I say.
Turn your head
so it will be my birthday.
You want me to stay eight forever?
Turn your head.
Yes! I did it!
I'm nine years old!
Nine years old!
Hurray!
Nine years old!
I did it!
Nine years old!
How do you know?
Is that true?
Yeah, I know.
Who are you talking to?
To Arturo.
Who's Arturo?
My friend.
And where is he?
Over there, do you see?
He's shy in front of other people.
Arturo, what do you think?
Shall we help him?
We did it.
Soon we'll be going back home.
Nobody believes that.
He just wants to visit his girlfriend.
Good. Good.
Hector.
Come?
Thank you.
- Wine?
- Certainly.
Who are you?
Who the fuck are you?
Partisans?
Who are you?
Partisans?
Come here! Come here!
Bastard!
Go! Go!
Fucking swine! Go!
- It's him, isn't it?
- Yes!
I knew he'd come back.
Everything's okay.
Tell them to put down their arms.
Americans?
Yes.
Here's some bread.
Thank you.
Peppi.
Gianni.
Italo.
Your documents.
Read this.
What are they saying?
Those two have been fighting
since they got here.
They want the German.
We're holding the German, he's ours.
We'll interrogate him once we
find someone who speaks German.
At headquarters a lot of people
speak German. Let's go.
First, we ask him questions.
Then we'll turn him over.
You're alive.
I told you to run and you made it.
Such a good Boy.
Such a good, clever Boy.
Just like my little brother, Ulrich.
You even have the same hair.
You have to listen little brother.
Listen closely.
You've got to run again.
Get away.
He's talking too much.
I told you we should have killed him.
Do you understand? Run.
Run again.
Run as fast as you can.
Shut up!
So, how did you get lights?
I don't know.
It was a Miracle.
Do you know what the real Miracle is?
Is that you're still alive.
So,
how are you feeling?
Want a chocolate?
It's good.
I need your help.
What's your name?
Angelo. Angelo Torancelli.
Me, I'm Hector.
Where are you from?
From St. Anna di Stazzema.
Angelo...
that German...
do you know him?
Yes. There were a lot of them.
What did he tell you just now?
He told me what he told me before.
He told me to run as fast as I can.
When?
Before. At the fire. At the Church.
What fire?
Your father and your mother...
Where is your father and your mother?
Why are you so afraid of him?
I'm not afraid of him.
He's my friend.
I'm afraid of the other one.
What other one?
Murderer!
Nazi! Dirty pig!
Burn in hell!
Send that son of a whore out here!
Get back!
We'll rip his eyes out!
Butterfly!
Who threw that?
Give him to us!
We want him now!
Go, go, go!
You have two days.
No more. Tell them!
He'll stay here.
I need another pair of eyes.
Excuse me.
Can we have a moment?
He wants you to go up the Mountain...
and tell us what you see.
Come on.
G.I. G.I. G.I.
Well?
Is it safe?
Yes, it's safe. Yes.
Good.
Come with me.
Go.
What's that?
I don't understand Spanish.
What is that?
A cigarette.
No, that's not a cigarette.
American cigarettes.
Good.
Very good.
What's your name?
Rodolfo.
God Almighty.
The tree of life blossoms
beside the shore of still waters.
Nor Sun.
There is no suffering in your Kingdom.
And we ask for your forgiveness
merciful Father...
that we have not seen
the light before this day.
For your light reigns forever.
It is a shining beacon that lights
the path to your heavenly throne.
But we are your people.
And we ask you, Lord, to walk
with us in our pain and our suffering.
in victory.
Come in.
You didn't know that the Germans
raised the price on your head.
From 50,000 lire to 100,000 lire...
and a bag of salt.
Not bad!
But you saw, no one
from the village turned you in.
Not even the Fascist Ludovico...
who's so stingy he keeps
his money in his underpants.
Not even Ludovico?
Not even Ludovico.
If they only knew who I am,
what L've done,
they'd pull my heart out of my chest.
Peppi.
What's tormenting you so much?
We surprised a German Patrol...
My little son Robert loves the rain.
My little Anna hates it.
Shut up you two!
Yes, Sir.
Where are you going?
I'll slaughter you.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
I'll slaughter you.
How many times do you want to kill him?
He's already dead.
Look what I found.
Here.
I'll keep this for my family.
My daughter is hungry.
At least L can give her food.
Take this.
This money is stained with blood.
We're suppose to catch the thieves...
not become them.
Let's not start a war between ourselves.
What's that got to do with it?
I gave you three years of blood.
To Italy and to him.
Three years of blood.
You're a Fascist
and you'll always be one, like Marco.
Here.
Take your money and go home.
I will take it home.
I will take it.
Go, go, go.
Go!
It's finished here.
You'll pay for this.
The Germans were blinded by rage.
We had been attacking them for months.
They were furious.
They combed the mountains
looking for us.
We had to hide.
We could have starved to death.
Nobody there.
A fellow Dartisan saved us.
Paselli was her name.
She was the one who told me
what happened at St. Anna di Stazzema.
Eat.
Thank you.
I had sent the others to Serravezza.
I had to meet one of our men
who had gone to look for supplies.
But then, because of the storm,
I had to stay in the mountains.
They marched into St. Anna.
They gathered hundreds of people,
women,
children,
children and old people.
There were also refugees.
They grouped them in the Square.
In front of the Church.
One of you...
knows...
where he is.
One of you...
has seen...
him.
So...
speak.
Everyone's quiet.
They don't know anything.
They're innocent.
They don't know anything.
I gave you fifteen minutes...
They're innocent.
to find someone who would tell us...
They don't know.
where is the hideout of the Butterfly?
They don't know.
And his Bandits.
Take only my life.
I beg you.
You still have one minute.
Kneel.
In the name of the Father...
And the Son...
and the Holy Ghost.
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On Earth...
as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us for our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from Evil.
I understand.
Is there something?
Yes, Sir...
There are orders from headquarters.
Yes?
It will be done.
Father.
Forgive them...
for they know not what they do.
They...
killed so many,
that they ran out of ammunition.
They burnt so many...
they ran out of fuel.
What has happened here...
everything that's happened...
is your fault.
You promised to bring The Butterfly.
- He told me he would be here.
- No. No. I don't care!
- I know these people.
- You will pay for this!
They have nothing to do with it.
Rodolfo, we had a deal.
No, I kept my deal.
I brought him here.
But you promised me, my dear Rodolfo.
You Italians don't know
how to keep a deal.
I betrayed my people.
I'll burn in Hell because of you.
You worthless Italians.
You will pay for this!
All of you Ltalians will pay for this!
Mama!
Arturo! Arturo!
No!
Stop! Stop!
Run! Run!
Run!
Child murderer!
Bloody traitor!
Come on!
Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Bring him back!
Go!
Finish him!
Kill him!
Move, move.
We can't go back without him.
Where's that swine?
Over there.
Even if I live a hundred years...
I've been dead from that day on.
Peppi.
You need a lot more courage
to live than to die.
But listen to me.
You have to accept the truth.
Someone betrayed you.
And you have to find the traitor.
Only thing I know...
The Germans were wrong
to provoke The Sleeping Man.
Because, you'll see...
In the end,
he'll protect us.
He'll protect his land.
I'm done.
I shit on Hitler's mother.
If I were in San Juan,
I'd eat a good plate of rice and beans.
And a sweetie pie for dessert.
I'll meet that swine...
in Hell.
Where's the German?
The Americans took him and they
kicked me out. I told you so.
We have to get out of here right away.
It's full of Germans making
their way down The Sleeping Man.
The Germans have lost, everyone knows.
What are you talking about?
He who made the mistake must pay.
Rodolfo...
Ludovico's not the traitor anyway.
We'll find him. Trust me.
Do you remember the time...
when Marco spent the week
staring at the Mountain...
convinced that
The Sleeping Man would awaken?
And how my mother yelled at him!
Of course I remember.
Sleep. Sleep.
Marco's dead.
I killed him.
In a firefight
with his Fascist comrades.
He would've done the same to me!
Because we're Partisans.
There's nothing left to see here.
Peppi...
Listen, if someone commits a sin...
a big sin...
and then he repents...
and confesses.
do you think he'll go to Hell?
I don't know. I'm not a Priest.
What have you become?
I don't recognize you anymore.
You are here rationalizing.
Always talking about my dead brother.
What do you want from me?
Do you want to know
who betrayed you at St. Anna?
We should have kept the German
instead of giving him to the Americans.
Maybe we'd have discovered
that he can speak Italian.
Maybe he would have spoke of you.
We've known each other a lifetime,
and you think it was me?
This is war, Peppi.
And in war people suffer; people die!
So, do you think the people at
St. Anna had to die because this is war?
I didn't say that!
I trusted you.
It was you that
I had to meet to get supplies.
It was you who suggested
St. Anna was a safe place.
What did you want to do?
Did you want revenge
because I killed your brother?
For the last time...
You should've told me, then I
would have let them only kill me.
Stop talking about my dead brother.
You killed him!
Hundreds of innocent people.
You sent me to Hell...
Bastard!
Come here. Come to me.
Come to me, please.
Chocolate Giant!
The Sleeping Man.
Get back. Get back.
Come away. Come with me.
Forward! Forward!
Spread out!
Move! Spread out!
Forward.
Be alert.
Liberty!
Forward!
Move, move, move.
Lock down the village. Move!
Clear the buildings!
Come on, kill the Blacks!
Those pigs. This way.
Over there.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Move. Move.
Go! Go! Go!
Run! Run!
Stamps!
We are Fascists!
Fascists!
Angelo.
You're not dead anymore.
Open your eyes.
Angelo.
Arturo, where am L?
It's not important.
We have to go.
Am L going to Heaven?
No, you're going home.
Where's my home?
Angelo, L'll show you.
Who's there?
Your Papa. Remember him?
What about my friend...
the Chocolate Giant?
You have to remember him,
me,
all of this.
This was our time to be children.
Come here.
Prepare to die.
This is over.
Gather the wounded...
and bury our dead.
