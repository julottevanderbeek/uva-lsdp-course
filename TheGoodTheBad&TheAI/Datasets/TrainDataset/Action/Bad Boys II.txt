This is our little boundary box.
So we gonna take the word
...and we're gonna put it in there

And the only way that you can

We cool?
Oh, shit.
We gotta go.
In front of my babies you got porno

What kind of freak-ass store is this?
And you two motherfuckers

Cover your ears, baby.
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...
...which, after 17 layers of bullshit...
...turns out to be registered
to Donna Maria Tapia...
...mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,
who calls himself Johnny.
Johnny Tapia. Shit.
Every time the PD goes after him...
...he sues for wrongful arrest.
And, oh, does he win.
Last year he was awarded $9 million.
And got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.
Well, he  run across us yet.
going on
in that house.
Use your computer brain
and tap the phone.
Well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.
We were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.
No, I  do that.
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.
With thick-ass glasses
you  need floor seats.
He can see the game
from the parking lot.

- Yes, Lakers.
Okay. Watch me work.

So y'all want to kill roaches?

These are your basic household bugs.
Dog, this is what we do.
-  the sprayers for?
- The roaches.
- Roaches? We got rats.
- Say what?
not an issue.
We can handle that.
We'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.
Nope. Nope. I  mess
with no rats.
Hey. Stop it.
- We're in. Get your head right.
- Mike,  a grown-ass man.
Get your grown-ass self together
and  do this.
- You got a beautiful house, sir.
- Well, start looking.
They're all over.
Those  normal rats.
What he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.
Disposing of the rats  a problem.
But we should ensure  no
breeding elsewhere in the house.
Yeah, at Zook...
...we like to work from the outside in,
you know.
So we gonna leave these...
Excuse me.
We'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.
be better to begin
in the rest of the house.
You're not getting
in the rest of the house.
We  be able
to guarantee our work.
The only thing that we can
guarantee...
...is that these rats will keep fucking.
Giving off offspring
until we find the colony.
Rats  got no stinking colony.
Well, actually these are colonial rats.
What they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...
Marsupials.
Marsupials.
These drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.
They just looking for rat pussy.
- You know.
- Are you fucking with me?
Hold on. You called us.
We can leave.
But what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.
All right. Down there. Just kill them
and bring me the bill.
that bullshit.
that bullshit right there.
- You see these rats?
- Plant your wires.
- You're not leaving me with them.
- Plant your wires.
Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef.
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?
Of course. And you? Josef.

I am.
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and
Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come.
- Where the fuck you going?
- Pretty bad problem you got here.

get some poison pellets and stuff.
Come straight back.
No screwing around.
They're all over.
Nice place you got here.

Built a fucking million years ago.
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.

Now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?
They fuck just like us.

down here.
Goddamn rats.
Yeah, they everywhere.
Just like cockroaches.
No disrespect...
...but I do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.
baffling. You secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?
wait for Josef. You know,
me and digits.
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?
So...
...your partner is here.
Would you like to talk now?
Carlos, another box.
So you sign over ownership papers
for all the Florida clubs you own...
...and I will control everything...
...from point of origin to sale. Okay?
No middleman. Especially Russian
middleman.
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...
...in my country, I see such things
all the time.
sorry for your country.
That must be some Cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.
I, me, Johnny Tapia,
will sever your head off!
You kill me and you will have
a shit-storm.
Should I screw your young wife...
...or visit your son,
the soccer player?
My daughter knows your son.
- You're gonna regret this.
- I hope that we can remain friends.
Because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...
...honour.
Without this,
we are no more than beasts.
The kitchen  out.
What the  going on out there?
Shit.
I found something.
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, I was just looking for you.
I think I figured out your problem.
Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.
Blow out!
-  going on? Shit!
-
This  got to stop.
Fuck!
We should go.
Go! Go!
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.
- Damn! Go!
- Come on!
Roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...
...that tried to hijack the drop, boss.
How did this thing happen?
I  know. We called the rat people
and these guys showed up.
Maybe you're the rat, huh?
They tried to steal from me, and
you let them into my  house.
Johnny. Hey, no.
I would never...
Nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...
...or my money.
Send him to the mortuary.
Johnny. Johnny,
what happened to Roberto?
He killed himself, Mama.
- Very sad.
- Write a nice letter to his mother.
I'll do it.
Okay. Bye.
- Yo, run the print.
- Mike, stop playing, man!
- Run the print.
-  touch me with no dead finger.
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.
Thank you.
Think you can find out
on these shreds?
Of course.
We're thinking about ordering lunch.
Should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?
- Very funny.  hilarious.
-  it low tide?
I think it is.
-  you have relatives to pick up?
- What?
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no,  not funny.
We're fucking with you. We planted
wires, we need some help. No bullshit.
I want you...
...to find out...
...who those two black
are.
And I want them lying right here...
...in  garden
in these coffins!
And our mystery finger
belongs to:
Josef Kuninskavich.
He was a lieutenant in a Russian mob.
Owned a couple dozen
Florida nightclubs.
starting to knock off
Russian mob bosses.
Got something.
What you got, dickhead?
The computer matches half tones,
grey tones, densities.
Sort of like a visual code-breaking.
Little something I put together.
The shredded papers was a photo.
Some kind of boat.
-  registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- The Poteet brothers.
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?
Mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?
Listen to what we got at Tapia's.
The second-in-command is talking.
telling him, "Yes, boss. We
found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...
...and we're getting them
- Fat does emptied?
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.
- She has no idea.  roll.
- Y'all come with us.
I ordered a couple
