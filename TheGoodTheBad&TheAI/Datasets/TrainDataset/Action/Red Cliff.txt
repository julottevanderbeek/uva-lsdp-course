Greetings, Your Majesty
Yesterday, I proposed a decree
for war against Liu Bei and Sun Quan
Has Your Majesty approved the decree?
The Prime Minister has just beaten back the Northern Wu Wan
Our troops and people need respite
The insurgents Sun and Liu
are ruling their own regimes down South
They plot against Your Majesty's Court
If they are not eliminated in time,
Your Majesty's Han Court, might well be theirs
Prime Minister,
please let me consider this further
How much further must Your Majesty consider?
I have waged wars across the land
Tens of thousands of soldiers have perished on the battlefields,
all for the sake of The Great Han Empire
Does Your Majesty still remember your exile?
Which, if any, among your Royal relatives rescued You?
I wonder, to this day,
if I had not eliminated the traitors,
how many more would claim the throne for themselves?
I hereby decree that
Prime Minister Cao Cao
be commissioned as the Commander of the Imperial Army
and go forth to pacify the South
Thank you, Your Majesty
Senator Kong Rong wishes to speak
Liu Bei is Your Majesty's uncle,
and Sun Quan is the third-generation heir to the Dukedom of Wu
They have no intent to rebel
Whereas you, Prime Minister,
are not only seizing all the powers of state,
but also intend to mobilize the entire army
There is no justifiable reason for your war!
Though you have solemnly vowed yourself
loyal to His Majesty's Court,
you will not be able to convince everyone!
The next one to put down a rebellion,
may not be you, Prime Minister,
but Liu Bei
and Sun Quan!
He is the first sacrifice
I thank the Prime Minister for this wine
Begin
Form up!
Watch it
My Lord
Zilong!
My Lord
You have returned
Our men made all possible efforts to hold our ground
until the last minute before abandoning the town
Luckily, most of the peasants have already fled
through the valley
My Lord!
The two ladies and the Young Master
are still trapped in the village
My ladies, please be careful
Don't cry
General Zhang
Chief Strategist, how does the situation look?
Cao Cao's pursuing forces are greater than anticipated
The cavalry vanguard will arrive at any moment
The Cao cavalry will use
a wedge formation to attack
We will reflect the light into their eyes to hold them off
Remember, the refugees need
at least an hour to retreat
We need a thousand more soldiers
for the second line of defense!
Leave it to me
Alright
Forward
My Lord
Zhu-ge Liang,
the peasants are moving slowly
It looks like they will need at least another four hours
We urgently need a thousand soldiers from here
Go aid General Zhang
That way Cao Cao cannot chase them
The peasants can be left to themselves
Cao Cao intends to make us surrender
He will not kill them
No! As you can see,
the elderly, the women, and the children all need our help
My Lord,
these peasants are dragging us down
To succeed, you have to set aside these trivial matters
These are Han people
They followed us only to escape from Cao Cao's regime
If we cannot offer protection to the civilians
then what is the meaning of this war?
I will find Guan Yu
Go and help my Lord
Sister!
Quickly! Bring the horse for My Lady
That looks like Liu Bei's family
Go get the baby!
My Lady!
General Zhao,
he is my Lord's only flesh and blood
He must not fall into enemy hands!
Rest assured, My Lady
I will take you and the young Master to my Lord
Let's go! Get on the horse!
My Lady, quickly!
My Lady!
General!
My Lady!
Step apart!
Flip the shields!
Attack!
Let's go!
Bailong!
Chief Strategist,
Where are our reinforcements?
Who is that man?
Zhao Zilong of Changshan
Why is there no such brave warrior under my command?
General Zhao
Zilong
Retreat!
We can still fight!
Why are we giving up so easily?!
We are greatly outnumbered by the enemy
If we can't protect the refugees,
our losses will be worse
Attention!
Protect the refugees!
It's an order!
Brother,
go quickly!
Leave! Protect the refugees!
Zilong, take the Young Master!
Retreat!
Attention, Third Battalion! Hold the line!
Protect the retreating refugees!
Quick!
Charge!
Second battalion, go!
Third battalion, get ready!
My lord
I brought the Young Master back
but the two ladies already...
Zilong
Get up...
Prime Minister!
Liu Bei is vulnerable
Look, the cowards have all fled
Dead bodies lie everywhere
The rest ran for their lives!
There is only one man still fighting
Surrender, and your life will be spared!
Kneel down!
Do not be so rude!
General Guan Yu,
a wise man chooses his Lord carefully
Why do you continue to serve Liu Bei?
You still won't kneel!
Protect the Prime Minster! Kill him!
Nobody move!
Prime Minister, why?
If he wanted to kill me, he already would have
Guan Yu cannot stab a man from behind
Liu Bei has lost many battles,
yet so many talented men remain loyal to him
One day, they will all serve under my command
I have suffered a lifetime of failures
This isn't the worst one
Cao Cao thinks he holds the Dynasty's fate in his hands
So long as I live and breathe
I will fight to end his crimes
against the Han Court
My Lord, I will go to the state of Wu tonight,
to ask for Sun Quan's support
Sun Quan?
Against Cao Cao? I wonder if he is strong enough
to fight an enemy as fierce as Cao Cao
Though Sun Quan is young,
he bears great ambitions within
For generations, the Sun Clan has ruled the South
They have the wealth and strength to fight Cao Cao
Wu needs us just as much as we need Wu
If our alliance succeeds, and we defeat Cao Cao,
then Cao Cao will definitely retreat back North
We can then go West and rebuild our forces
Once we are in control of the West,
Cao Cao will control the North, and Sun Quan, the South
We will form a power triangle
This division of power is the only way to stop Cao Cao
My Lord, please rest assured
Are you confident you can convince him?
Eat some more
The road to Wu is long, and you will need energy
Prime Minister, the surrendered generals,
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, are here
These two men are untrustworthy
Please be cautious
I trust those who are of use to me
Greetings, Your Highness!
Rise
How many ships and men have you brought with you?
We have with us three hundred thousand naval troops
and more than two thousand
battleships and boats of various sizes
Great!
Now we can be
tigers that swim!
Your Highness,
here is our letter of surrender
General Cai,
I see many grammatical errors here
I hope your military strategies
are not as poor as your command of literature
I hear you have frequent exchanges
with the State of Wu
Your Highness,
I have declared war on Wu many times
These so called exchanges are limited to only this
No need to explain
What is this?
This is a map of Wu that I drew
taking great pains to be precise
General Cai,
you took great pains indeed
Your Highness,
Liu Bei has fled to Xiakou in defeat
If he eventually joins forces
with Sun Quan's Wu clan,
then I fear that...
Then isn't that in our best interest?
If Sun Quan forms an alliance with Liu Bei,
then he is harbouring a traitor
and rebelling against the Royal Court,
which justifies our war
Liu Bei, a shoe weaving Royal uncle,
His whole life is a failure
Sun Quan
is a young upstart with no achievements
When a loser join forces with a coward...
what can they accomplish?
Though my Lord is young,
he shows wisdom beyond his years
Speak frankly and don't hold back
The senior advisors will be your biggest obstacle
You say we can fight this war? We can't!
Hopefully,
he has some good strategies to use against Cao Cao
This time around, Cao Cao is determined to fight
We are gravely outnumbered
How could we ever hope to fight this war?
We cannot fight!
Greetings, Your Highness
Mr. Zhu-ge,
I hear that Cao Cao
beat Liu Bei into the mud at Xinye?
The defeat at Xinye was due to my Lord's noble heart
He did not abandon the thousands of refugees
who followed our troops and slowed down our retreat
How large is Cao Cao's army?
A ruthless army of eight hundred thousand
is invading from both land and water
Cao Cao's real target is not to defeat Liu Bei
but to conquer Wu!
Your Highness governs the vast Southland,
and has many extraordinary gentlemen in your court
If you are determined to oppose Cao Cao's invasion,
then please prepare for war!
My Lord!
Do not fight!
When the late Duke was still alive,
he always told me
that nothing is more important
than the peace of Wu's people!
We cannot fight, my Lord.
That's right. To surrender is not so bad
For the cowardly, in fact, the earlier the better
That way everyone can stop worrying
If that is the case,
then why didn't Liu Bei surrender?
Confucius spoke of giving oneself to justice,
and Mencius spoke of sacrificing for righteousness
Surrendering is not a matter of victory or defeat,
but rather one of virtue!
Cao Cao, the self-proclaimed Prime Minister,
controls the Han Emperor, and
fabricates His Majesty's commands
If he conquers the Southland, he will surely usurp the throne
If we surrender to Cao Cao, then we would be aiding a tyrant
Lord Mayor Liu Bei is of His Majesty's Royal Family
His wisdom is known to the world and respected by the people
If a noble man, who has been loyal to the Han court all his life,
fails to succeed, then that is fate
But, how could he surrender to Cao Cao?
That would be
an unbearable shame!
However, it is fine for Your Highness to surrender
At least, you will be able to keep your life and possessions
At Cao Cao's mercy,
he may let you remain as the ruler of the Southland
So why not?
You are saying I am nothing compared to Liu Bei?
No,
Your Highness shows an outstanding brilliance
greater than that of most and akin to that of Lord Liu
Your Highness is capable of ruling the vast Southland
This alone, is a major advantage over Lord Liu
My Lord,
Mister Zhu-ge has come before you
with a plan for fighting Cao Cao
It would not hurt to hear him out
Though my Lord suffered a recent defeat,
we still have Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun,
as well as the Navy that they command
with at least ten thousand men
If we join forces with the elite generals and troops of Wu,
the alliance will strengthen us both
Although Cao Cao's military outnumbers ours,
more than half of his troops only just surrendered to him
and are not entirely trustworthy
They have traveled over one hundred miles every day
They are exhausted
As the saying goes, a worn spear
cannot even penetrate a thin cloth
Moreover, Northerners are not used to the Southern terrain,
and they have no naval experience
Their abrupt invasion is destined to result in failure
You make well reasoned points
My Lord,
please do not fall into Zhu-ge's traps!
We cannot justify fighting
against Prime Minister Cao, My Lord!
Our alliance with Liu Bei
will only justify Cao Cao's war
It is better to take Liu Bei captive
and turn him over as a gift to Cao Cao!
No! We shall first fight, then surrender
So that we leave Cao Cao with a bitter taste
One hundred thousand against eight hundred thousand!
What kind of a war is this!?
Cowards!
All of you are shameless cowards!
How dare you!
We cannot fight
Your Highness,
I know you have been concealing your abilities
The sword had been hidden away for too long
Now is the time to draw the blade
My Lord, this Zhu-ge Liang
is determined to drag us into trouble!
Don't! My Lord!
Speak no more!
I have heard this far too many times!
Let me think it through
Let me think...
How beautiful!
This really is heaven on earth!
Unfortunately, with the arrival of Cao's regime,
all of this beauty will soon turn to ash
Your words had almost persuaded his Lordship
For the alliance to happen,
I only need to persuade one other person
Zhou Yu. Viceroy Zhou
Exactly!
The Duke regards him as his own older brother
The Late Duke had also said,
for internal affairs, seek Zhang Zhao
For foreign affairs, seek Zhou Yu
He is now encamped at Red Cliff
He is the right one to seek
Stop!
Give it to me!
Are you not capable of holding a spear?
There must be power within every stroke!
One more time!
Stab!
Slash!
Strike!
Swing!
Stab!
Slash!
Strike!
Swing!
Mister Zhu-ge, the Viceroy is over there
Form up!
One other wing
The Goose Formation
Not bad
A pity that it is outdated
Give it to me
Your Honor!
You try
Thank you
Your Honor!
My family's water buffalo
was stolen from the fields near the barracks
Some people saw...
Your Honor, this is Mr. Zhu-ge Liang
Greetings, Viceroy Zhou
Greetings
Why carry a fan on a cold day like this?
It helps me remain calm
It's the one old habit I cannot give up
You do not look like an anxious person
This way
What are you laughing at?
I am not laughing, but appreciating
I am appreciating that these soldiers
know not only how to fight, but also how to appreciate music
You are knowledgeable in the art of war
Just a little
Yet you say my formations are outdated
No man but you
can hear me from that far away
I have sharp hearing
This way
General Gan, Mister Zhu-ge said
that your formation is outdated
Are you aware that a bad formation can kill our brothers?
I have never thought of killing my own brothers
The power of the formations comes from the heart
There is no such thing as outdated!
This is...?
This is General Gan Xing
Pardon me, General Gan
General Gan and his army,
used to be the most notorious pirates in the South
You cannot joke around with him
No problem
I am impressed by everyone's performance today!
But this elderly gentleman had his buffalo stolen
in the rice fields near the barracks
Was this done by one of my brothers?
He who did it gave all our brothers a bad name!
Find him!
Who did this despicable thing?
Lu Su, tell me,
what is the penalty according to law?
By law,
the penalty is death!
Step forward. Reveal yourselves
Step forward
I have a way to find them
Since the buffalo was stolen in the rice fields,
then there must be mud on the shoes of the looters
Am I correct?
Yes!
Attention, Gan Xing Company!
Everyone,
run to that tree,
around and back
Go!
Quickly! Follow up!
I did not drag those people out today
because I want to give them a second chance
The Wu army does not tolerate looting!
What we really need
is to stick together
I have failed
to train my soldiers
I beg your forgiveness
I dare not!
I dare not!
These soldiers are difficult to train
Yet, these soldiers, have great potential
Things like this happen because of our shortage of supplies
You gave us half of your wealth to help build this army
Now, supplies are short again
So how about giving up the other half?
Whatever you say is fine by me
Then it's settled
Your Honor!
Your Honor!
Bad news!
I told you
this friend is difficult to deal with
It's a breech birth!
It's a breech birth!
Hold this
Luoyue,
hang in there
My Lady! The pony still hasn't...
Be quiet
She can't give birth with you being so loud
It's coming
Xiao Qiao, what's happening?
A breech birth
It will come out soon
Your Honor, for horses...
Be quiet!
Breech births are very rare
The pony has not come out for two days
What is happening?
Why is there only one leg?
He can't come out
What should we do?
The other leg is stuck
Simply dragging it out will not work
He is...?
He is Zhu...
He is Zhu-ge Liang, a friend of mine
Step back a little
You are knowledgeable in this too?
A little
I helped cows giving birth
Horses should be much the same
Excuse me, let me try
The two front hooves need to come out together
for a natural birth
The pony does not have a name yet
He was born in the Southland,
so he should have a Southern name
How about Meng Meng?
Meng Meng?
Meng Meng, stand up!
He can't stand up!
Stand up!
Come on!
Stand up!
I hope we can watch him grow each day
I want you to promise me,
when he is grown,
not to make him a warhorse
Viceroy,
Xiao Qiao looks like
she's the proud new mother herself
Viceroy, time is of the essence
War or surrender?
Lu Su,
today we are celebrating. Let' s not discuss affairs of state
Alright,
Since Mr Zhu-ge is learned in music,
why don' t we play a tune together?
I know only...a little
You know a great deal
You are only hiding it
If you two gentlemen can work together,
then that will be a perfect match
Please
Thank you, madam
Thank you, Mr. Zhu-ge
My husband has not played his qin for a long time
I, too, have not been so enervated for a long time
We still haven't discussed the war
How can we leave?
His answer is within his music
He will fight this war
I think you two can be great partners
His music tells me,
that he needs friends
Your music tells me
that you need to fight this war
Prime Minister,
desire and obsession
can also cause of headaches
Have you not heard that desire makes one young!
This painting must be by Your Highness
Her name is Xiao Qiao
When I was young,
her father thought very highly of me
I saw her only once
Now, she is the most beautiful woman in the world
and married to Zhou Yu
After I pacify Wu,
she will be mine
Gentlemen, you are all here
Yes, Your Highness!
General Cai, your ships are well built!
Thank you, Your Highness
I have guarded Jingzhou for many years
With the strength and power of our current navy,
we will surely defeat Wu
Great!
What? The two generals are saying,
that our ground troops are just for show?
General Xia-hou, while we Northerners are great on horseback,
the Southerners are experts on the water
To destroy Wu,
we will need the hard work of General Cai and his navy!
Thank you, Your Highness!
General Cai,
What...
is the best food in the South?
River fish is the best food in the South
Then...
what is the worst thing about the South?
The weather is the worst
This is the windy season
The wind can often be unpredictable
Victory
Six dragons lead my chariot
I will ride the wind with the greatest speed
With all of the feudal lords under my command,
to rule the world with one name
On land and sea, with forces numbering eight hundred thousand,
I wish to meet Your Highness at the hunt for Wu
This Cao Cao
really has some nerve
What does he mean by a hunt for Wu?
Brother
Smile!
We will get through this
They all want you to smile too
When father was nineteen,
he was known as the Tiger of the Southland
When my late brother was twenty-six,
he conquered the Southland
I am now twenty-six,
yet I have done nothing!
It seems that my achievements
will never be able to be compared to theirs
No matter how hard I try,
those old advisors call me worthless
Brother?
You came at the right time...
He will not listen or even smile
My Lord,
what is it?
Cao Cao requests our surrender. See for yourself
You have not used this for a long time
Let's go
He is cunning
Do you see him?
This beast is watching us
He is sinister, playing with his prey
Is he not like Cao Cao?
Though Cao Cao is Prime Minister, he is the real traitor,
always ambushing from the darkness
In the entire world, not one person likes him
Brother, what are you afraid of?
There!
To be honest,
I was prepared for war with Cao Cao three years ago
Cao Cao claims to have an army of eight hundred thousand,
yet many are surrendered troops he cannot trust
He can actually use only one hundred thousand of them at most
Our troops have high morale
We have knowledge of the Yangtze and greater naval expertise
Moreover, Cao Cao has no justifiable reason for his war
But those senior advisors!
They are only concerned about protecting themselves
You need not listen to them
Your late brother once told you
that you are a better administrator,
but that he is a better commander
That made you lose confidence
But he only said that to make you strive to surpass him
Tiger!
Help them!
Go quickly
Get out of here
Can you walk?
Are you alright?
The beast is over there!
Go
Do not hesitate anymore
