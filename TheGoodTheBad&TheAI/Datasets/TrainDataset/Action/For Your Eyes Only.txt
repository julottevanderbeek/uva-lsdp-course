Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond,
I'm so glad I caught you.
Your office called. They're sending
a helicopter to pick you up.
It usually is.
Thank you.
Don't concern yourself
with the pilot.
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.
Think twice, 007.
It's a long way down.
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr. Bond.
I intend to enjoy it
to the full.
Really, have you no respect
for the dead?
I trust you had a pleasant...
fright.
You are fading
from my picture, Mr. Bond.
But the end
cannot be far away.
I'll buy you a delicatessen
in stainless steel.
Put me down!
Put me down!
But you won't need
to read between the lines
You'll see what no one else can see
'cause now I'm breakin' free
Afternoon.
How's it looking topside?
Beautiful day.
Just bringing the nets in.
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.
- Afternoon, sir.
- Oh, hello, Mac.
Where the hell
did that come from?
- What the devil's going on here?
- An unidentified object closing fast.
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral, sir.
I'm afraid we've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St. Georges.
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday...
We sighted floating debris
this morning.
My God, Jack.
How deep is the water there?
Yes, Comrade Secretary.
Off Albania.
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.
It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining...
Oh, of course, comrade.
There will be no direct involvement...
but if it comes on the market,
we should not lose...
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece.
Give us a kiss.
Give us a kiss.
I'll give you a nut.
Here you are. Go on.
- Your packages, senorita.
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Your call from Athens
was such a pleasant surprise.
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.
Ah, yes, I wanted to come back here
and start work on the temple again.
- You between jobs?
- Only for a few days.
- I'll lend a hand if you want.
- Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.
That's for you,
and pistachios for Max.
Moneypenny,
a feast for my eyes.
Well, I was going to get
around to that.
You'd better go in.
M's on leave...
and the minister's arrived here
with the chief of staff...
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.
Are you aware
of our ATAC system, 007?
ATAC, sir? Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.
Uses an ultra-low frequency coded
transmitter...
to order our submarines
to launch ballistic missiles.
Five days ago, our spy ship,
St. Georges was sunk...
Now, if that transmitter
were to fall into the wrong hands...
it would render our entire
Polaris fleet useless.
- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.
Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.
Have we begun
a salvage operation, Minister?
An official operation
was out of the question.
The St. Georges was off
the Albanian coast.
the marine archaeologist,
to secretly locate the wreck.
Before he could send in his report,
he and his wife were killed...
by a Cuban hit man,
Hector Gonzales.
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales...
from a description given to them
by Melina, Sir Havelock's daughter.
Operation Undertow.
The information's all here.
Now, Gonzales is at a villa
near Madrid.
Isolate him and apply
the necessary pressure...
standard issue,
British Secret Service.
Whoever you are, you've outstayed
your welcome. Come on.
- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.
The Havelocks?
I'm sorry.
How did you know
where Gonzales was?
Through a detective agency.
What were you doing there?
I'm afraid we're being
out-horsepowered.
You don't mind
if I drive, do you?
Go backwards. Forwards.
Quickly.
I love a drive in the country,
don't you?
Oh, by the way, we haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.
It should be safe to go
to the airport now.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, really.
Are you going back
to your father's ship?
Yes, I'm continuing his work,
but this business is still unfinished.
- What business?
- The man who paid Gonzales.
"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves. "
You're English,
but I'm half Greek.
You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.
We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead in the water.
She'll have our guts
for garters.
at page two, paragraph four
of my report, sir...
you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.
Now, assuming that that was
for Havelock's murder...
then there's still
a glimmer of hope.
Why don't you try
the identigraph?
- Yes, sir.
- Get cracking, 007.
Hello, Q.
Smithers, how's the arm?
Coming along very nicely,
thank you, sir.
- Identigraph, Q.
- This way.
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.
I see you managed to get the Lotus
back together again.
I disregard these jibes
about our equipment, 007.
I don't suppose you find it funny
in the field.
This 3-D Visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.
Now, once we get
a composite of the man...
we can find a match by patching
into the photographic files...
of the Surety, Interpol,
CIA, the Mossad.
And the West German police.
You've told me so already five times.
Thank you, 007.
Right.
Now describe the person
you wish to identify...
Male Caucasian,
late thirties.
- Parted in the middle.
- Wait a minute.
- Right.
- Eyes.
- A little smaller.
- Uh-huh.
That's it. You have it.
Now, nose.
- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- I'm sorry.
No, no, mouth wider.
Good.
- You can go. I'll lock up.
- Okay.
I reckon we're almost there, Q,
apart from glasses.
- Yeah.
- Octagonal.
That's him.
That's our man.
Right. I'll try
and get a match.
The man we want is
Emile Leopold Locque...
an enforcer
in the Brussels underworld.
He's been convicted
of several...
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.
Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.
The Italian Secret Service think
that he is, at this moment, in Cortina.
I'll instruct Ferrara, our man
in northern Italy, to contact you there.
- Yes, sir.
- And 007, try not to muck it up again.
I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?
The snow this year
is better at Innsbruck.
- Ferrara.
- Bond. James.
If Locque's in Cortina,
we'll find him.
I have a reliable Greek contact here,
an Anglophile.
He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.
- What's he doing in Cortina?
- He...
Spends a few months a year here
at his chalet.
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.
The British gave him the King's Medal
for resistance fighting during the war.
I've set it up. He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.
- Kristatos. Ari Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.
Would you care to join me
in some gluhwein?
That's a very good idea.
Thank you.
Well, gentlemen,
how can I help you?
My protege.
A sure winner...
She's completely absorbed
in her skating...
but innocent in the ways
of the world.
Bibi, here are some
new admirers for you.
Mr. Bond, Mr. Ferrara,
Bibi Dahl...
and her coach, Jacoba Brink,
once a world-class skater herself.
I think the world will soon be seeing
a great deal of your skating too.
- Much harder.
- Oh, Uncle Ari.
Can I stop now?
I'm pooped.
Come, Bibi,
another half hour of practice.
Uncle Ari, will you take me
to the biathlon?
Bibi, you know I have to work
this afternoon.
Bibi wants to know
if you would escort her, Mr. Bond.
- I don't think...
- I would feel better...
I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonti.
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque.
Milos Columbo.
His name came up in connection...
with a smuggling operation
last year.
That's the least of his offenses.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.
In the Greek underworld,
he in known as "the Dove. "
- Where is this Dove?
- Somewhere in Greece, I would guess.
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.
We fought together
in the Greek resistance...
After that,
he took a different path.
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Kristatos.
My pleasure.
I leave for Corfu soon.
If I get any more information,
I will call Ferrara.
What do you think, Luigi?
Does this "Dove" Columbo...
have the resources
to mount a salvage operation?
Oh, definitely. He runs a fleet of
intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Thank you. I'll take it.
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristalo.
- May I help you?
- Yes, give me a dozen lilies.
Send them to the funeral,
will you?
Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what the devil you're doing in Cortina?
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.
- Are we leaving?
- Not "we. " You. And now.
You don't tell me
what to do.
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?
That's why you're here.
Driver, stop! Go back!
- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?
You do that, and we'll never find out
who or what is behind all this.
It was my parents they killed,
not yours. Let me out. Driver, stop!
You were lucky once,
but they are onto you now.
The telegram, the motorcycles
back there. They prove it.
- Let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?
All I can tell you is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.
He thought it important enough
to risk his life.
Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.
- I promise you.
- Okay.
I'll go back and wait,
but not for long.
Don't they have showers
at the ice rink?
He'll do anything for me,
and I'll do anything for you.
Well, I'm exceedingly
flattered, Bibi...
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.
How about building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes?
but I don't think your Uncle Ari
would approve.
Him? He thinks
I'm still a virgin.
Yes, well, you get your clothes on,
and I'll buy you an ice cream.
That's why I'll get the gold medal...
breath control.
You know something, Bibi?
You're fickle.
We'll have a drink
at the finish.
Well, Bibi, I'm afraid
I have to leave you.
- No, James, stay with me.
- I have an appointment.
Will you come and say good-bye to me
at the practice rink later?
Please, James, we're going back
to Greece soon.
all I can say is
don't grow up any more.
- Huh?
- The opposite sex won't survive it.
- Don't play with any of the switches.
- Right.
Tell me more about your boyfriend,
Erich Kriegler.
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.
Of course. What else can you tell me
about my rival for your affections?
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.
It is time
for your rubdown.
Farewell, Mr. Bond,
but not good-bye.
I'll be finished around 6:00.
Meet me here.
I radio telephoned the Triaina,
and they told me you were coming ashore.
I have to go shopping for the crew.
Come with me, we can talk.
My father loved the view
from here.
- I can see why.
- We came here often.
- Is Corfu your home?
- No.
My real home's always been
the Triaina, the Greek islands...
Turkey, North Africa...
wherever my father's work took us.
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since.
I'm meeting a man tonight
at the casino who may give us a lead.
Only half?
Where's your courage, Bunky?
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.
Would you cash these in
for me, please?
I'll have the prawns,
salad and Bourdetto.
An excellent choice.
I'll have the same.
May I suggest a white wine
from my home place?
If you'll forgive me, that's
a little too scented for my palate.
After our last meeting,
I am asking myself...
why you want to know about Locque,
Columbo's man.
I know Columbo runs heroin
to be refined here...
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there.
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.
He is a secret partner
in this casino.
Expensive mistress.
She sometimes shills for the house.
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?
I will speak to you any way I please.
Sit down.
You're making a spectacle
of yourself.
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.
As you wish. Take my car.
I'll play a little chemin.
Ask the chauffeur
to come back for me.
No, thank you.
I'll take a taxi.
Seriously, you may have a job
finding one.
I'm writing a novel
about Greek smugglers. Know any?
Smugglers? How would I know
any smugglers?
I would think that
a lady in your position...
I'm a night person. I have
champagne and oysters in the fridge.
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.
- Manchester?
- Close.
That you're a spy.
To find out more about you.
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.
- What should I do with you?
- You cannot just arrest him.
- Does this discourage you?
- Huh?
I'm here, Mr. Bond
of the British Secret Service.
He's the one
with the powerful connections.
Locque works for him,
not for me.
I smuggle, yes.
I smuggle gold, diamonds...
Sit down.
That I leave to him...
when he is not too busy
working for Russia...
Yes, I know.
But other people died for it.
During the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.
I would laugh
if my heart was not so heavy...
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him...
your government might
give him another medal.
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.
not only my people, but the entire Greek
police will be down on you...
By tomorrow,
we'll be good friends.
Mr. Bond, you have
what the Greeks call tha'ros.
for salvage work
at depths of over 300 feet.
- Raw opium.
- An old smuggler's trick.
You left this with Ferrara,
I believe.
We can't be sure for certain.
We know it was in this vicinity.
Your father was
using the temple as a front.
so he wouldn't find
the St. Georges before he did.
Kristatos.
How can I help?
Where does your father
keep his daily log?
Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.
- Give us a kiss.
- What's his name?
He used a special kind.
Only I could decipher it.
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.
Three days later,
he sighted a wreck in the same area.
Air would be useless at this depth.
We need a mixture of oxygen and helium.
The less people that know,
the better.
I'll give the crew shore leave
except for the mate and two others.
An oxygen-helium mix will give us
eight minutes. We'll have to work fast.
Wouldn't the crew have destroyed
the transmitter?
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.
under lever right of ATAC housing,
dualled...
by ring main circuit
through anti-handling charger. "
The destruct timer's set
at one minute.
For some reason,
the lever wasn't pulled.
The transmitter
with a thermite charge.
That's it.
Let's get out of here.
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.
Get to the sub.
I'll stall him.
Careful, James.
It's 5,000 years old.
You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.
We'll double
whatever you're getting.
It would be bad
for my reputation.
I will deliver it
and return with the money.
The voice of the KGB. Our agreement
was that I designate the meeting place.
After they pay,
I will give them the transmitter.
We will take the ATAC
to St. Cyril's.
St. Cyril's.
I'll arrange the pickup.
Bind that wound.
We don't want blood in the water yet.
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.
I didn't think it
would end like this.
Ahh. The sharks have them.
Make port.
- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.
And probably headed
to Moscow or Havana by now.
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.
St. Cyril's, where we used to hide
from the Germans.
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.
My friend, I've been studying
this place...
Your best approach is on the right face,
away from the building.
Then you will have to make towards
the shed on the left...
which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.
It can be operated
only from the shed.
- James is counting on surprise.
- But we are only five men.
That's the pits! I'm supposed to
be skating in Oslo, in Innsbruck.
Our plans are changed. We are
going to live in Cuba for a few months.
- Cuba!
- You can skate without distractions.
What a drag.
I want to win the gold medal.
But you're too old for me.
I'm splitting.
- You have poisoned her against me!
- Don't blow your top, Ari.
- Leave her alone.
- I will deal with you...
- Aah!
- Shut him up.
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.
You know,
I will never leave you.
Where's Kristatos?
And keep your voice down.
We are leaving him.
He mustn't know until we're gone.
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.
- Go back to your room!
- You can go to hell!
- Where's Kristatos?
- He's left with the ATAC.
You're not as fast
as you used to be.
No, Melina,
that's not the answer.
We'll turn him over
to the Greek police.
but be prepared to dig
those two graves.
You don't have it.
I don't have it.
It seems as though Bibi
has a new sponsor.
- How's it going?
- I've patched through...
a high security line
to the satellite.
- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.
Mr. Bond on the line,
Prime Minister.
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased...
we all are that your mission
was a success, thank you.
Don't thank me, Mr. Bond.
Your courage and resourcefulness...
Denis and I look forward
to meeting you.
Meanwhile, if there is anything
I can do for you...
I think we're having
a little trouble with the line, madam.
You idiot.
Get on to him.
