Takeyour seats, please.
I just talked with the Cartel.
They're concerned that the rumors
are getting out ofcontrol.
They'd like to make a statement
in two hours.
Some ofyou may not know
we've had another incident.
At 1 520 hours yesterday,

However, traces ofanillegal

Bring her in, please.
Lieutenant Ballard,
please be seated.
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police
officers have rights these days?
Representation by counsel
won't be necessary.
Your rights are protected
by the Matronage.
You can speak freely.
- Then I'm not being charged?
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
This is a discovery hearing...
and your presence is required
as ranking officer.
I wantyour after-action report.
WWhere's the rest ofyour team,
the prisoneryou picked up?
WWhat happened at Shining Canyon?
Last Friday at 1 750, we were
slamming through a dust storm...
on the edge ofthesouthern valley.
servicing themines
in the outersector.
Mysquadwashitchingaride
intoShining Canyon.
You beat me.
- Looks likeyou played tarts before.
- No, I've never done this.
Let's spin 'em again.
One down and one up.
Fuck me! The five ofbats.
You got the wheel up.
WWhat's yourwager?
Five bucks.
Helena? Hey.
Sorry.
WWeather station's tracking a huge
storm across the southern sector...
and we're right under it by now.
- WWhat's the mark on it?
- 3,200 kliks.
WWe should be there by 1 800.
Just let me know
ifyou need anything.
You high?
Fuck, Helena, it'sjust clear.
I'll be straighter than this track
long before we hit the canyon.
You better be. This prisoner
transfer is no sleepwalk.
- WWe're picking upJames WWilliams.
- You mean ''Desolation'' WWilliams?
Cooling his heels
in the Shining Canyonjail.
Deep solitary.
- WWhat's the charge this time?
- Murder.
The man's been up on murder three times.
He gets offevery time on self-defense.
It's different this time.
Sounds like he finallywent psycho.
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.
WWilliams shows up at the mine
with some bizarre-ass story.
Sends three officers to the medevac
before they locked him down.
- You starting to see the picture?
- And all we got is you, me...
and this new guyJericho
and a couple ofrookies?
WWhat doyou think
ofSergeantJericho?
I was hoping we'd get a good,
solid woman we could count on.
I don't know.
I guess we'll see.
WWell...
I need you straight, Melanie.
Don't worry about that,
Commander.
I'm as straight as they come.
Such a shame.
Check on
our transfer schedule.
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon,
this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
They ready for us?
This storm's really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.
Here's your coffee, Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites.
Just the wayyou like it.
You want some?
No, thanks.
How long?
About 40.
Shining Canyon.
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.
ETA, 40 minutes.
Everybody checkyour equipment.
I don't want any surprises.
Is everything all right,
Lieutenant?
I couldn't help but notice that charming
little scene with the queen bee.
Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, Sergeant.
She figures ifI want to make captain,
I'll have to pay the price.
Thing is, I don't give a damn
about wearing another bar.
It could be that.
Or maybe shejust has
good taste in women.
Sergeant, you are
seriously out ofline.
I'd hate to spoil my record.
All right. I knowyou think
you're some pretty tough hombres.
You've had the best training.
You have the best gear.
You probably think this is
some routine prisoner transfer.
But that's what I want
to bang intoyour heads.
There's nothing routine
about this prisoner.
WWe are here to pick up
James ''Desolation'' WWilliams.
I wantyou all jack-ready
and double tough.
Officers, you can disembark here.
WWhat time is departure?
WWe need at least halfan hour
to secure our prisoner.
WWe got about
a four-hour turnaround...
and we'll be back
at this spot at about 2200.
You can re-board any time after that.
See ifyou can raise
theyard master, will ya?
Ed? Ed, you out there?
Rookies, useyour breathers.
WWe're not gonna have air like Earth
for ten moreyears. Let's go.
- God, I hate this thing.
- You'll get used to it.
Twoyears ago, we were still
wearing full-face breathers.
It takes about a month to get over
the headaches out here.
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.
- First time in the boonies, rookie?
- Standard layout.
Just another shitty boomtown
like all the others.
Seen one, you can go home.
You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower...
and they don't tell you
that a one-year contract here...
equals twoyears' Earth time.
You gotta read the fine print.
WWhere is everybody?
Yeah. Friday night,
the place should be packed.
A whole 12hoursbeforesunup,
andthere'smoneytoburn...
whores to fuck
anddrugs to take.
Instead, wegotagraveyard.
Maybe they're all inside,
spending their money.
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.
You and SergeantJericho
check in at thejail.
Save some hot water for me.
WWhere wereyou before Chryse?
Utopia.
It's the arse end ofthe universe.
A penal camp full of
work-amnesty cutthroats.
Sounds nasty...
butyou seem to be
holding together all right.
WWhatyou see is nothing.
I have numerous
hidden talents.
Need some help with that?
You're persistent, aren'tyou?
I've changed a few minds
in my time.
There's not many
ofus breeders around.
I'd hate to miss a chance
to give it a go.
WWhat doyou say?
Hello!
Anybody here?
Officer to front desk.
WWell, hello, Mr. WWilliams.
No one seems to be about.
WWhat doyou make ofit?
I don't know.
Doyou want me to pop the lock
and ask the prisoners?
WWhat doyou mean, pop the lock?
That's a level-eight security door.
I've got a mystical waywith
locks and mechanical objects.
There isn't a machine on Mars
that doesn't love me.
How about we checkwith
the commander first?
So what doyou do for fun then?
Areyou a gambler?
No. I'm short-time, Sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.
Let me put it this way.
Maybe I'd sleep with you
ifyou were the last man on Earth.
But we're not on Earth.
It's a voltage overload,
most likely.
You want to check it out?
It's probably nothing.
But on second thought--
Police officer.
Anybody there?
Shit!
- This is not making me happy.
- It's time to get backup.
Jesus Christ.
WWhat areyou doing?
- I almost killed you.
- WWhat's going on?
- Rec-fac's a slaughterhouse.
- WWhat?
Slaughterhouse?
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.
According to what
Commander Braddock told me...
right afterwe first arrived
in Shining Canyon...
she and the two rookies headed
towards the recreation facility.
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.
You and SergeantJericho
go and check in at thejail.
Save some hot water for me.
Descanso, sweep left.
Bashira, stickwith me.
Officer to train,
doyou read?
The casino, barracks, dining hall,
rec center, no one alive anywhere.
- Commander.
- WWhat?
- I can't reach the train.
- WWell, keep trying.
How are we doing?
I don't know. This thing
was built to stay locked.
And WWilliams
is still locked up?
WWhat doyou mean?
WWilliams was arrested
on the suspicion ofmurdering...
six rail workers and a payroll courier
up at Klik 305 Hub Station.
The bodies were hung and decapitated,
just like the bodies in the rec-fac.
So how'd they pin that
on Desolation?
He showed up here
with the courier's payroll.
The cashier realized
it was a stolen scrip.
They made the arrest.
There's got to be a day log
here somewhere.
Sergeant's desk.
Here.
Last night the mine called in
a work stoppage.
Reported winds
gusting up to 60 knots.
- Sixty?
- That's what it says.
Anything else?
Arrest for theft, then nothing.
Got it.
WWhat's going on around here?
WWe haven't had a meal
or a piss break in six hours.
Descanso, open the door.
All right, everybody, answer ''here''
when I call your name.
- Akooshay.
- WWhat?
Just answer ''here.''
- Yeah.
- Zimmerman.
I'm right in front ofyou.
Benchley.
- WWho's that?
- She showed up last night.
Checked herselfin. Insisted on
being locked up here with us.
WWell, wake her up, sunshine.
Let's see what she has to say.
Somebodywants to talk toyou.
- WWho areyou?
- WWhitlock.
WWhat areyou doing
in the holding tank, WWhitlock?
It's the only safe place
at the moment, okay?
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- No, you can't!
I need answers.
WWhat's going on out there?
WWhat's your I.D.?
Dr. Arlene WWhitlock.
I'm the Spec Six science officer...
in charge ofthe mining operation
at Drucker's Ridge.
I left Drucker's about a week ago
with a weather balloon I'd modified.
There wasa disturbancein town.
Itseemedprudent togetout.
They said there was a riot
and the place was destroyed.
Yeah, something like that.
I was adrift for several days,
you know.
Ran out offood.
Ifollowedtherailroadtracks
untilIgothere.
Oh, shit.
Then thestorm forcedme toolow.
Ihita windmillandcrashed.
And theywere kind enough
to take me in here.
WWell, wasn't that nice ofthem.
Mel,Jericho,
go check out WWilliams.
See ifhe knows anything
about this.
WWilliams, doyou know
what's going on outside?
Areyou aware of
what's going on outside?
Let's go. This asshole
doesn't know anything either.
You got some balls, calling him
an asshole to his face.
That's Desolation WWilliams.
I heard he took out at least six when
they cornered him at Deimos Station.
And this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate.
Just goes with the territory.
Yeah, well, in my case,
it's a bit different.
Perhaps a connoisseur likeyourself
would appreciate what I have to offer.
Go get the commander.
Disarm her.
Officer.
It wasalmostlikeshe was...
possessed.
Like there was some kind
offorce inside her.
- WWho was she?
- She was a dispatch officer.
WWe tried to make her comfortable.
The rookies took her to a storage
room in the back ofthejail.
Then the commander and I went
back outside to look around town.
- WWhat doyou think?
- That the science officer is lying.
- Tell me again about WWilliams.
- I didn't read the full file.
Caught him with the money,
but he said he didn't kill anybody.
- Course. They all died offright.
- Then cut their own heads off?
Put down yourweapon!
Put it down!
CallJericho.
SergeantJericho,
we need backup!
WWe're 20 southwest
ofthe rec-fac.
Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!
WWho goes there?
I can't fight it!
It's in me!
Commander Braddock!
There's a man in there.
Open it.
The lock is destroyed.
I gonna need a cutting torch.
How long?
At least halfan hour,
maybe more.
WWhat the fuck
is going on here?
He committed suicide.
Before he slit his throat,
heyelled something...
something like, ''Stay away!
Don'topen the door.
Stayaway. ''
And now
the commander's gone.
Maybe he was contagious.
Or crazy.
I don't know.
I saywe take him at his word
and leave him locked in.
Look, one ofus has
to staywith the rookies.
WWhy don'tyou go back to thejail?
I'll find the commander.
Let's get the hell
out ofthis place.
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.
You're right.
Okay, let's go.
Drop the weapon before
I cut this dyke bitch head off!.
WWhat the fuck happened?
Bashira let him out
for some food.
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.
- WWhat doyou want, WWilliams?
- I wanna get the fuck out ofhere.
WWe'll letyou walk.
Just let the girl go.
You think I'm falling for that shit?
I can't letyou take the rookie.
Take me, okay?
Put the gun down.
Put 'em down!
Dropyour gun, Descanso.
Yeah, drop the gun, Descanso.
Relax! Take it easy!
Just relax, relax.
- You'll get whatyou want.
- I know I'll get everything I want.
Now let's go.
Damn girl,
I likeyou already.
Shit.
You okay?
Just swell.
- WWhere's WWilliams?
- He took offout the air lock.
He went into the clinic.
I saw him go in
not even two minutes ago.
Let me guess.
He's gotyour shotgun, right?
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.
He's still in there though.
I can see the back door from here.
All right,
you two take the back door.
I'll go in front and flush him out.
Ifhe comes atyou, shoot to kill.
Now what?
How the hell did that happen?
- Let's go.
- WWait a minute.
Looks likeyou're
coming with me now.
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.
- I said move it.
- I ain't going nowhere.
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.
Now move it!
Let me askyou something.
Ifyou're so innocent, how come we
found all that stolen flash on you?
I didn't say I was innocent.
I said I didn't kill nobody.
Okay, let's say I believeyou.
WWhat exactly happened
at K-305?
I don't know.
I wasjust changing trains
from Camp Sinai.
Hadalittle time
togetmesomething to eat...
so I wentinto thestation.
It wasjustlying there,
soyou tookit.
You would have done
the same thing.
See, that's whereyou're wrong.
I'm a cop, not a crook.
It's a thin line between
a cop and a crook these days.
You think it's a big difference
between you and me?
Youjust got the woman
behind your bullshit.
Look atyou.
You look high right now.
You know
I saved your life out there.
So why don'tyou save mine
and let me out ofhere?
Look...
myjob is to bring you back
to Chryse to stand trial.
I don't thinkyou did it.
But that's not my call.
So let's not make this any more
complicated than it has to be.
Yeah, it's gonna be
real complicated.
You can believe that shit!
I ain't going back!
Soyou secured your prisoner.
WWhere was your commanding
officer during this time?
I can only report what
SergeantJericho told me later.
After the man in the Rover
committed suicide...
Jericho went looking
for the commander.
Let's get the hell
out ofthis place.
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.
Commander Braddock!
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hearyou.
The commander's dead.
Everybodyin themine
hasgoneinsane.
Jericho, can you read?
Hey, come on!
Let us out ofhere!
Start at the beginning!
- I told you. I got here last night.
- Don't bullshit me!
Lieutenant!
WWhat the hell is going on
out there?
WWhat?
In semiarid regions on Earth,
there are certain organisms...
that live in small pools
that are formed by the annual rains.
WWhen the pools dry up,
those organisms can't live.
But they don't die either.
They go dormant below the surface...
away from the hot sun
until the next rain cycle begins.
Then they reemerge.
I think something like that
is happening here.
I don't understand.
WWhatever used to live here,
we woke it up.
It takes us, okay?
I'm talking about
a kind ofpossession.
Lieutenant, SergeantJericho
is on the radio.
He said he found
three people out there.
They're on theirway in and
they got an ETA offive minutes.
You should get on the radio
and talk to him.
- He's found three people?
- That's what he said.
- You okay?
- No.
Something broken?
I'm all right.
But it's out ofthe body now.
Yeah, it's loose in here.
Lieutenant,
sergeant's on the radio.
Lieutenant, we're coming in.
Canyoureadme?
- Sergeant, where areyou?
- We're rightdown thestreet.
WWe? WWho's we?
Ifoundthreepeoplealive outhere.
Come on. Open the doorforus.
I tried to reach you on the radio.
Justyou make sure that door is locked.
There must be
and any minute now
they'll be coming to kick our ass.
Okay, relax.
WWho are these guys?
I found them hiding
up in the mine shed.
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.
Sergeant, you'rebreaking up.
Icanhardlyhearyou.
The commander's dead.
And everybody in the mine
has gone insane.
Check the window!
They didn't see him.
They're gone.
- WWho areyou?
- WWho are we? WWho areyou?
- The man asked you a question.
- My name'sJericho.
At least he's not one ofthem.
WWhat's happening out there?
WWho the fuck are those clowns?
WWhat are they
all sparked up about?
Used to be miners.
Then everybody
in this place lost their mind.
Running around,
chopping people's heads off.
Ease up, man.
WWe were up on the rim
when they called a work stoppage.
- WWhat are they doing?
- Shit, I don't know.
Look at that. They're
knocking offearly for the night.
How will we sneak in on a shift change
ifthey knock offearly for the night?
Shut up!
WWhat the hell is that?
Let's get the hell out ofhere!
WWe hid till the storm was over.
Later, I went out
to take a look around.
I thought they wereall dead.
Thensome ofthem
startedto come to.
They walkedaround
like they were confusedorlost.
A fewofthemseemedokay.
They was trying
tohelp the others.
- Then they started changing.
- WWhat doyou mean?
They act different,
stand different.
Start cutting on themselves
for decoration.
Filing their teeth.
Making weapons.
Killing the ones
whohadn'tchanged.
Cuttingpeople's faces off
andwearing them formasks.
You lads got anyweapons?
I mean real weapons.
Only cops can have guns.
There's some detonators
in them cases over there.
Doyou know
how these things work?
I knowyou need dynamite
to use them.
Okay, then.
WWe take our prisoner
and we all get on the train.
And what prisonerwould that be?
That doesn't concern you.
Ifit's Desolation WWilliams...
it concerns me very much.
Now dropyourweapon.
All ofyou!
WWeapons on the floor.
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.
WWe lied.
Now go get WWilliams.
I don't think so.
WWhat was that?
- Fucking kill me.
- No problem.
Look, will you two
stop fucking about?
Lieutenant, let WWilliams out.
Give me one good reason.
I just gaveyou
about 200 good reasons...
and they're probably outside
right now.
It doesn't matter that WWilliams
is wanted for murder...
and it doesn't matter
that this lot are scumbags.
WWhat matters right now is that
we stick together to get out ofhere.
All ofus...
including WWilliams,
including them.
WWho areyou calling scumbag,
motherfucker?
Now quit with all your fucking
stalling and take us to WWilliams!
I'll be goddamn.
Finally.
Man, this town done went crazy.
WWe had to improvise.
You like it?
I love it.
I wantyou to let him out.
WWhat's up, D?
I'm still shackled.
WWhat, areyou pigs on a fucking break?
Free him up.
I knewyou'd let me go.
- It's been a long time.
- I didn't thinky'all could do it.
Piece ofcake.
It was my plan, Desolation.
Fuck!
- I thoughtyou was watching the door.
- I was!
- Bitch, you better open this door.
- I don't think so.
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blowyour head off.
Then your asses will never get out.
Someone will find you sometime...
probably tied upside down in here
with your heads cut off.
Tell your dogs to quit barking
so we can talk.
Put 'em down.
Put it down.
Listen to me, WWilliams.
WWe don't have a lot oftime.
You need us and we need you.
WWe've all seen
what's going on out there...
and none ofus is gonna survive
ifwe don't stick together.
I need you to give me
yourword...
that ifI open this door...
you and your boys will stand by
my command at all times.
I never give myword.
It's okay.
I never make deals
with criminals either.
- You got it.
- WWhat?
You making deals with cops?
And you are too.
Give heryourweapon.
Everybody, give it up.
WWell, introduce us
toyour friends.
These my compadres.
Uno must be the nice one.
You got that right, Butchy.
I'm not as nice as Desolation.
And I'll cut
your fucking titties off.
WWho's in charge here?
You better let go ofmy arm.
WWho is in charge here?
You! You!
Shit!
So, youjust gonna stand there
and watch her break my shit.
Yeah.
And now thatyou're done mopping
the floor, get me a beer, killer.
WWhat's next?
WWe get more deputies.
You're deputized.
Consider this
a martial law situation.
Let's go.
WWhen did this start?
It started a few minutes ago.
- WWhat should we do with him?
- WWe can't take him with us.
Then here he stays.
Guys, what is that?
It's a Laffer.
A black-market breather.
It has a 1 5 percent
nitrous mix.
It gets you high?
It turns your brain
into Swiss cheese.
- One gross ofdetonators.
- WWhat are those good for?
It would help
ifwe had some dynamite...
but they make
a pretty good bang.
WWe could put them in some food cans
or something, make some hand grenades.
All right.
You got ten minutes.
Easy.
Here. Let me do it.
That's beautiful.
That's whatyou get, dumb-ass.
You're gonna be okay
to do this?
All right,
it's almost 2200 hours.
Here's the plan,
short and simple.
Descanso andJericho take the lead.
Everybody else follows.
It's about 50 meters
from here to the station.
Bashira and I are in the rear.
Any questions?
Putyour hand down.
All clear.
Let's do it!
Hey, bro, I don't see
no motherfucking train.
Hey, lady.
WWe don't see no train.
It'll be here.
Come on. Let's go.
That's the mine office.
WWhat are they doing?
Looks like they're tearing the whole
town apart, building by building.
Come on. Pick it up.
Lieutenant.
Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.
Go!
- WWhere's the train?
- I don't know.
You don't know? WWhat the fuck
is that supposed to mean?
Lieutenant Ballard to the train,
come in.
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?
Yeah. It's the same as plan A.
You got any fresh ideas?
Yeah. WWhat we should have done
in the first place.
Shit!
Come on,
you mindless motherfuckers!
- Second time I saved your life.
- Run a tab.
Jericho, grenade!
Come on, man. On your feet.
Let's move.
Shit.
Open that door.
WWe sealed the air lock doors, and
SergeantJericho dismantled the lock.
They couldn't open the door
from the outside, so we were safe...
for a while.
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.
WWhere's your brother?
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, God.
Uno was your brother?
Yeah.
Look at him.
WWhatever is inside ofhim
has waited a long time to get out.
I didn't understand their design,
how they move.
But it's got to be the wind.
Yeah.
Yeah, the wind takes them.
And then once their hosts die...
they drift along the railroad tracks
from town to town, human to human.
WWhat a perfect creation.
Vengeance on anything or anyone that
tries to lay claim to their planet.
WWhat did you see
at Drucker's Ridge?
I was at the mine when
they called a work stoppage.
It was a Section 740,
a ''scientifically significant find.''
A 740applies toanynumber
ofthings foundon Mars.
A biologicalorganism, anindication
ofwater, things like that.
After we dynamitedthemountain,
we discoveredan entrance.
It wasa tunnel
carvedinto therock.
Ithadbeenhidden underneath
the outer walls forcenturies...
andsomeone otherthanman
hadcarvedit.
Jesus!
- WWhat the hell was that?
- I don't know.
Let's get the hell
out ofhere!
It was me.
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.
I contacted the train.
They're about three kliks north oftown
on a decoupling spur.
- They said the tracks are blocked.
- Can they get through?
Yeah, they're working on it.
- You okay?
- Yes.
- Barricaded the rear door.
- Good.
There's a maintenance courtyard out
the back enclosed by a five-meterwall.
There's even
a Rover parked out there.
Maybe we can make
a run for it.
No, we wait.
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.
WWell, ifa train comin',
they better hurry up.
WWhat's the matterwith you?
You did good out there.
Yeah, right.
It's a fucked-up situation.
I never put too much faith in cops,
butyou did all right.
You trust me?
Hell, no.
I really don't understand you
at all, Desolation.
The only one looking out
for me is me.
Doesn't that botheryou?
Nothing bothers me.
I stopped worrying
a long time ago.
Don'tyou believe in anything?
I believe in staying alive.
Yeah, but forwhat?
Stick around.
I might letyou know one day.
WWhen?
WWhen the tide is high
and the water's rising.
Doing okay in here?
Check this out.
- WWhat about it?
- It's pretty solid.
One way in and a back door out,
leading to the rear entrance.
- A good sturdy door.
- So what's your point?
It's rather cozy,
don'tyou think?
I don't believe this.
You lured me back here
to seduce me?
Yeah, well, the way
things are going...
I thought this might be
our last chance to--
to dance.
Yeah.
Fuck him,
whatever the fuck he is.
It's out ofhim.
Everyone go! Get out!
Let's take her out back.
WWhat the fuck doyou mean?
WWe aren't moving her anywhere.
It's taking her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.
Easy, man.
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.
Come on.
Let's put her down
before they hear us.
This belongs to her.
- WWhere did you get it?
- I stole it.
Doyou know what it is?
It's her stash.
This will mess
with anything in there.
Bon voyage, Mel.
Let's get the hell back in here.
I will not.
I wasaware ofhaving...
thoughts...
or memories.
Like I'd been invaded
by something...
and it was trying
to take me over.
Something inside ofme wouldn't let that
other thing take over and I fought it.
I didn't know where I was at first,
and then it hit me.
I was outside alone...
unarmed.
The backwall's been breached.
Don't worry.
The back door's locked and secured.
Letmein.
It'sme.
Shit!It's Melanie!
Open the door!
Looks like her to me.
I haven't heard any of
these things speaking English.
Come on, Williams. The tide's
gettinghigh outhere.
Give me those keys.
Come on!
Is ityou?
Yes.
It's me.
I had a glimpse
ofthe Martians...
oftheir minds,
ofwhat theywant.
Theywon't rest short ofthe
destruction ofany invading species.
As far as they're concerned,
we are the invaders.
Something's kicking out there.
Shit. They made
a battering ram.
Everybody to the rear
ofthejail.
Bashira, you andJericho
go back to the storeroom.
Load up on detonators.
You're the second line ofdefense.
WWe stay here?
WWe hold them offas long as we can,
then we fall back to the storeroom.
Soon as we kill one ofthem, whatever
is inside is gonna come after us.
I know.
So ifone ofus gets possessed--
Leave 'em.
Here we go. Party time.
- I'm out.
- I'm out.
- Clear!
- Move! Move!
Clear!
- Clear! Clear!
- Stand clear!
- Clear!
- Get out!
- I got it.
- Take them out back.
Get out ofhere.
Come on!
Come on! Let's go!
Look for the train. See ifyou
can get someone on the radio.
Jericho, get this thing started.
WWhitlock, unlock the gate.
Come on! Hurry up!
The train's at the station.
- Officer to train, doyou read?
- WWhere the hell haveyou been?
- WWhere the hell haveyou been?
- All right, Bashira, come down.
All right, wait for us.
WWe're on ourway.
Let's go.
Get in!
Getyourselves ready.
Oh, my.
Come on!
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on!
Okay, go! Go!
WWhat the hell happened toyou?
WWe got trapped a couple ofkliks
north ofhere, trying to off-load.
I'll get us out ofhere.
WWe've got to go back.
Slow the train down outside oftown,
then come to a complete stop.
No way.
- I'm giving you an order.
- I don't care. The answer's no.
The answer's yes.
Look...
even ifwe get back to Chryse,
those things will just keep coming.
WWe've got a chance here.
WWe've got a chance to stop this thing
before it goes any further.
This is about one thing--
dominion.
It's not their planet anymore.
WWhat about him?
Isn't it ourjob
to take him back?
Is he still a prisoner
or is he one ofus?
I can give a damn
about saving this planet.
Seems like it's been after me
since the day I was born.
IfI'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die fighting...
not running.
Ifwe blew up the nuclear
power station, what would happen?
I mean, there'd be
a huge explosion, right?
No, not unless you retract
the control rods and expose the core.
Then what?
Then you'd have a small
atomic bomb going ''boom.''
How small?
I don't know. It'd blow out
a radius ofa mile, maybe two.
WWould it kill them?
It would certainly destroy
their human hosts, but as for them...
I don't know.
Jericho, can you get us in?
I can try.
Theplan wassimple.
SergeantJericho, thescience officer
andIjumpedoffthe train...
andheadedtowards
thepowerplant.
The othersstayedaboard the train
asitbackedinto thestation.
Theidea was theyprovide cover...
anddistract the Martians
as weset the charges in theplant.
They they'dswingback, pick us up
andwe'dallgetas faraway...
from Shining Canyonas we could
before theplaceblew.
Like I said,
it was a simple plan.
The only problem was, it didn't work
the way it was supposed to.
- How areyou doing,Jericho?
- I'm working on it.
Hurry up.
WWe've got to remove the waterjacket
and destroy the containment shell.
WWhere do I put the dynamite?
Officer to the train, they've
spotted us. Getyour ass back here now.
Yeah?
Let's go.
WWe've got to get out
ofhere fast.
The Doc says the blast radius
could be up to two miles.
- WWhat does that mean?
- It means step on it.
Stay here and keep it
full throttle.
WWhat areyou gonna do?
Lighten our load.
I think there's some
more dynamite in the rear car.
Seeyou later,
you big motherfucker.
You okay?
Sayyour prayers.
I didn't know
you was cut this deep.
Should've taken care
ofthis hours ago.
You do that like a pro.
Yeah.
Me and my brother
been through a lot ofbattles...
ever since we was kids.
I never thought I'd go to war
with somebody likeyou.
I know when you get to Chryse, you'll
tell those people that I helped you...
and I wasn't the cause
ofall this mess around here.
'Cause I know they're looking
for somebody to blame.
I swear toyou, WWilliams...
as soon as I get back, I'm gonna tell my
superiors about this fucked-up planet.
They'll drop the charges
as soon as they get the report.
That ought to hold it.
WWhen you get there,
have somebody look at it.
I couldn't get it perfect,
so it might leave a scar.
I'm getting a collection.
You'll be all right.
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.
I'll getyou a blanket.
WWhat the hell areyou doing?
Oh, this is where I get off.
WWhat areyou talking about?
WWe'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't letyou turn me in.
I can't letyou walk.
WWhatyou gonna do,
fucking shoot me?
There's nowhere to run.
Anywhere is better than hell.
Catch you later.
Yeah, right.
Shit.
And what happened to WWilliams?
I don't know.
WWhen I woke up, he was gone.
And you were handcuffed?
Must've done it
while I slept.
At that point,
I trusted him.
That's all you have to tell us?
That's all I know.
All right, Lieutenant Ballard,
I suggestyou get some rest.
You're dismissed.
Is our statement to the Cartel going to
be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?
Attention, allpolicepersonnel...

Time to stay alive.
Ifyou everwanna come to the other
side, you'd make a hell ofa crook.
You'd make a hell ofa cop.
Let'sjust kick some ass.
It's what we do best.
