Weatherly: This is
the third opposition leader
assassinated in Bolivia
in the past month.
The situation down there
has been a mess
since President Carrizales
took over.
So you think
that President Carrizales
is taking out his enemies
to ensure his re-election?
It appears that way.
But many countries
are about to have
a renewed interest in Bolivia,
including the U.S.
- Lithium.
- Exactly.
Turns out that Bolivia sits
on the world's largest deposits.
Every battery needs it.
Every cellphone needs it.
The leader who controls Bolivia
will have the power
to influence the most important
currency in the world... energy.
And we're hoping that leader
will be Javier León.
He's a moderate,
married to a schoolteacher...
brother's a priest,
a man of the people,
and someone we can work with.
Who has a target on his back.
The state department
is quietly sending
the undersecretary of state
to meet with León in two days.
It is imperative
that he remain alive.
I have an asset down there
who can assist your team
when they arrive.
Whoever the killer is,
he's good.
And the president doesn't
want to take any chances.
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad?
I threaded the needle.
Let me show you how it's done.
Okay, I'm just gonna study
your form.
Boom.
Mm-hmm.
Mm, it looks like we have
a bit of a runaway over there
on the left.
Should we put out an A.P.B.?
It might have fled the state.
- You distracted me.
- Mm.
- Jameson.
- Morning.
I haven't seen you down here
in a while.
I guess
he's shooting off memos.
Okay,
Special Agent Chris Jameson,
let's see what you got.
That's how you shoot off
a memo.
No strays.
Lillian needs us
at C-Doc.
Lillian:
This is a series of photos
that was taken by an ATM
outside of LA Paz
just moments after the vicente
assassination in the brothel.
I know it's hard
to make him out here.
We don't have
a positive I.D. yet,
but we believe that
it's the same man seen here.
Same hat, same jacket.
And this was taken a little
while after the second killing.
If he committed
three assassinations,
we have every reason
to believe that he's the one
that's now targeting
Javier León.
Gabriel.
Do you recognize him?
- Yeah.
- Who is he?
Lieutenant John Norris.
- Lieutenant?
- Delta Force, tier 1.
Is the chip telling you that?
Don't need the chip.
He was my best friend.
Lillian: Gabriel Vaughn, one of our nation's
most decorated soldiers.
He's a hero, and now our
country's most secret weapon.
Gabriel possesses
a rare genetic mutation
that allowed us to implant
a microchip in his brain.
We connected his mind directly
to the information grid.
It's something the chip does
that nobody expected.
I can create a virtual snapshot
of an event in my mind
and then walk through it.
It's like
a virtual evidence wall.
At U.S. Cyber Command,
we created a highly
specialized unit around him...
Amos:
Satellite in five.
And assigned
an agent to protect him.
Run!
He's the first of his kind...
the next evolution
of intelligence.
So, how does a... special-forces
soldier like Norris,
that kind of résumé,
become a hired mercenary for a
crazed despot in South America?
Combat's addictive.
No other rush like it.
A lot of guys start jonesing
the minute they leave
the battlefield.
But to become an assassin?
Were there any warning signs
with Norris?
Psychological spikes,
morally questionable behavior?
Morally questionable behavior.
Yeah.
It's called war.
There.
Go, go!
Aah!
Come on. Come on.
Aah!
Ohh.
- Aah!
- You good?
Hang on. Hang on.
My tank's empty, bro.
I counted 15 of them.
I'm out.
I got, uh, five rounds.
You got to keep moving.
I'll dig in here.
Ah, funny guy.
You never were that good
at math, Norris.
Even if you hit them
with all 5 rounds,
that still leaves 10 of them
to kill us.
Oh, they won't kill us.
They'll torture us.
Good. For a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.
All right.
You sit tight.
I'm gonna draw them off.
I'll circle back around
for you.
That's your plan?
What's the first rule of delta?
Everybody goes home. Everybody goes home.
That's right.
All right.
You hang on to this.
Come on.
What am I gonna do with one bullet?
Just in case.
Don't want to end up on YouTube
with your head chopped off,
do you?
Hey. Johnny.
Thanks, bro.
Of course.
We're landing.
Gabriel, look.
I know he's your friend.
my friend.
What happened between you two?
He used to say
I was his conscience.
That doesn't sound so bad.
He didn't want a conscience.
So, going up against him...
Not a problem.
Is that our CIA contact?
Agent Dale Cogan.
He set up the meet
with Javier León.
Hello.
I'm Javier León.
This is my wife, Marcela.
Agent Vaughn.
This is Agent Jameson.
Agent Neal's keeping
an eye outside.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure's ours, sir.
So, how does this work?
I'll bring you
to a secure safe house,
and you'll remain with me there
until the undersecretary and his
team have arrived in country.
Agent Jameson will then take you
to the location of the meeting.
And where will that be?
It's better
if we don't tell you that yet.
At this point,
any information is need-to-know.
You don't trust me,
señor Vaughn?
Respectfully, sir,
we don't know your team.
This is my wife's brother,
nestor.
He's the primary reason
we're still alive.
You played two seasons as
a midfielder for Banda Roja.
- You follow LA Paz football?
- A little bit.
- Gabriel.
- Mucho gusto.
And what will you be doing,
Agent Vaughn,
while Señor Jameson is
keeping us so safe?
I'm gonna find the man
who wants you dead.
No matter how I feel about
the men who have been killed,
assassination is the lowest form
of political protest.
When you find those
who are responsible
for the murder of my opponents,
please bring them to justice.
We'll do our best, sir.
The package is safe
and on its way to the kitchen.
As certain as I can be,
given we didn't set up the meet.
Is your guy Cogan reliable?
Of course.
If anyone would have the intel on
Norris, it would be Agent Cogan.
Well, we're about to meet him.
Nice digs.
When you guys say “clandestine”"
you really mean it.
I don't appreciate his manner.
You'll get used to it.
Sort of.
You sightseeing?
It's a secret service tick.
I don't like going into places
where the only exit I know of
is the door we're walking in.
Relax. Uncle Sam pays the rent.
It's all wired.
There's a security camera
above that door.
I'm looking back at us
right now. Say “cheese”"
let's go.
Something's wrong.
Get behind me.
get behind me.
Riley.
Gabriel.
Together, then.
One, two...
Three.
- Is that Cogan?
- It's him.
Norris!
Norris!
Norris is in the back
of the house.
Gabriel!
You tripped something.
Run!
Are you okay?
Ugh. I think so.
Are you?
That was close.
He's gone.
We lost him.
So, what's our theory on this?
Norris found out
the CIA was tracking him,
so he killed Cogan.
And booby-traps the apartment
to take out
any other spook
who shows up there.
Now that he's seen me,
it just got personal.
And for you, is it personal?
No.
He's just a guy we have to
bring down, nothing more.
Who are you calling?
C-doc. We have to tell them
Norris killed Cogan.
I have a better idea.
Let's call Norris.
How do you plan on doing that?
He's got a cellphone on him.
I caught the digits
right before the room blew.
Can you use it to track him?
He's too smart
to use a next-gen phone.
What do you mean?
The older ones don't have GPS...
harder to track.
We'd have to triangulate
off three towers.
And we're in Bolivia.
We're lucky we have one.
So you're just gonna call him?
Why not?
Yeah?
Gabriel: Where are
you running to, Johnny?
Believe me,
I'm as surprised as you are.
The hell are you doing here?
I came to see you.
So what's your game, brah?
Who are you working for?
I was gonna ask you
the same question.
We need to meet.
I want to talk.
No, we don't need to talk.
You need to step off.
Or what, Johnny?
You know better
than to ask me that.
Did he threaten you?
It's just the way
he says hello.
Don't shoot, bro.
Might need that bullet.
Aah!
You said this place was clear.
It is.
Come on. Come on. Get up.
Come on.
Where the hell are they?
Relax.
I got it covered.
Come on.
Aah!
Shut up.
Are you out of your mind?
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I won't hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Shh. Shh.
Great scream.
Why don't you set off a flare
while you're at it?
Where's the father?
Wasn't here.
He's probably one of the guys
out there trying to kill us.
No. We're not animals.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Lillian:
No, we couldn't have, Lillian.
Not out here,
not without a satellite.
Why don't we have a satellite?
The closest one is over Mexico.
It'll take hours to get it
in place.
So, what?
I'm an assassin now?
You press a button,
and I kill a man?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I press a button
and you kill a man.
That's how it works.
Are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear.
You and I might
become friends after all.
Unlikely.
I wish my students
were more like that.
Like what?
Straight to the books, no matter
how awful the situation.
And what is so awful?
That we have to be in a place
like this, hiding like cowards.
When Cleopatra was at war
with her brother
for the throne of Alexandria,
there was one prize
that she needed first.
Caesar.
If she could seduce Caesar...
Mm... She'd have a
titan for an ally.
And are you prepared to lift
your dress for America?
Jameson:
Okay, your men are outside.
Nestor will remain
in the house with us.
What do you have there?
It's a blueprint. There's
a control room downstairs.
The Bolivians officially
ejected the U.S. in '84.
The CIA needed to protect
their people who were still
in the country,
so they built
these safe houses.
Technology's a little outdated.
It should still work.
Now we have eyes.
What about communication?
Well, there's no cell tower
in the area.
Fortunately,
we brought our own.
A mobile satellite terminal.
With this puppy,
we'll be able to remain
in direct communication
with our team at all times.
Okay, you two should
get some rest.
The undersecretary will be here
in the morning.
Here?
It's the perfect location.
It's rural, secluded, and
it's completely off the grid.
Sounds like the making
of a ghost story.
Let's hope not.
Riley: Do you think Cogan
had anything on his computer
that will help us find Norris?
If he did, we'll never know it.
This thing's too far gone.
I can't get anything off it.
You said that you and Norris
were once best friends.
What happened?
Fallujah.
Fubar clusterbang
if I ever saw one.
We shouldn't have survived it,
but we did.
After that,
our backs were glued together.
Combat changes people.
No.
It reveals them.
Killing a human being
for the first time
makes a normal person
sick to the stomach.
For others, it's an appetizer.
It makes them hungry for more.
And that's Norris.
By the time I left
my last tour,
he wasn't the same guy I knew.
I'd lost him.
There's just one thing
I can't wrap my head around.
What's that?
Why didn't he kill us?
What are you talking about?
He set a trap for us
at the apartment.
Almost blew our heads off.
That trip laser wasn't meant
for us specifically.
Norris got what he needed,
set a trap for whoever else
came in.
It just happened to be us.
But when he saw your face,
he could have headed us off
and taken us out, but he didn't.
What are you thinking?
You just said Norris
got what he needed from Cogan.
The safe house...
Cogan knew the location.
Gabriel. Jameson, he
knows you're there.
Jameson, can you hear me?!
Norris is coming!
He's already here.
Why is he just standing there?
He knows we're watching.
He's trying to lure us out.
No, no, no.
What are they doing?
I sent them out there
to kill him.
Okay.
Do you know how to use this?
Of course.
You and Marcela lock yourselves
in here when we leave.
Let's go.
Stand behind me.
No, no.
Of the two of us, Javi,
I'm the only one
who's served in the military.
Give me that gun
before you shoot yourself.
Aah! Ohh!
Norris, I know you're in here!
Jameson's down.
I don't know how he got inside.
Looks like the bullet
went through.
Take it easy, nestor.
Is he gone?
He went that way.
Where's Javier and Marcela?
They're safe.
They're in the control room.
Norris has got to be close.
He doesn't give up.
Riley, you stay here
with Jameson.
You don't actually think
you're going after Norris alone?
I know how he thinks.
You gonna be all right?
Stellar.
Keep pressure on it.
Gabriel.
We can't lose Norris, and you can't
let Jameson bleed out. Thanks.
What do you suggest?
Be careful.
Can't get away, Johnny!
I'm better at this than you!
That's your problem!
You always thought
you were better!
You want to hunt a tiger,
you better take him down
in one shot!
Satellite in place?
Yes.
Thermal is detecting gunfire.
Can you isolate that?
Gabriel, can you hear me?
Not a great time right now.
We just got off with Riley
and heard what happened.
Okay, I really got to run.
The satellite is just now
getting into position.
Can you access the feed?
Technically,
that'd be cheating.
Excuse me?
Never mind.
Did you lose the connection?
He just cut it himself.
There's no place you can go
I can't find you, Norris!
Norris!
Here I am.
You got the shot.
Question is,
do you got the steel?
What a surprise.
He can't do it.
I don't have to, Johnny.
Why's that?
You're standing in the middle
of a minefield.
Prom-1
anti-personnel mines.
Planted by pinochet
in the '70s.
Hard to see,
but, you know, effective.
You want to survive,
you're gonna need me.
Don't take another step!
There's a nut-cutter three feet,
two inches in front of you.
How the hell do you know that?
I got a satellite.
In your brain?
Also, the Bolivian military
kept detailed maps
of the minefields.
Which you somehow memorized.
Are you insane?!
You're gonna have to trust me
if you want to get out of there!
I know where the mines are,
but you're gonna have to follow
my instructions exactly.
Turn to me.
Take two steps forward.
Unh-unh-unh!
Simon didn't say.
That's not funny, man.
You always were too serious.
Go ahead.
All right.
One step to your left.
You see that rock?
Stay to the right of that rock.
Before you take another step,
we're gonna put our guns away.
You think I would shoot you
after this?
Yeah, Johnny, I do.
One step to your left.
Make that log.
You're home free.
Thanks, bro.
Hey, hey!
Yeah,
I'll take your weapon now.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey, patrol's here.
About 100 yards out,
heading straight toward us.
Where's the mom
and the little girl?
Hey, shh, shh, shh!
Shut up.
Shh! Shh!
She's gonna get us killed.
Hey, shh, shh!
Shh.
It's gonna be okay.
__
Can't let you do that, brah.
Oh, you just killed us.
__
__
__
You're lucky, boy.
You could have gotten killed
for some kid
you're never gonna see again.
They didn't ask for this.
They're innocent.
It doesn't matter.
What does matter, Norris?
The first rule of delta...
everybody goes home.
All we have to do
is survive, bro.
First rule of life...
remember what
we're surviving for.
I don't get it.
Why didn't you let me bite it
out there?
'Cause I'm not an assassin.
What do you call
what you did to Cogan?
What are you talking about?
I never met Cogan.
That's 'cause you killed him first.
What are you trying to pull?
You killed Cogan.
We both know it.
And why would I kill Cogan?
Same reason you killed
the other three Bolivians.
Cut the crap, Norris.
I saw you there.
I showed up to check in.
Check in?
I worked for Cogan.
You saying
you work for the CIA?
Red op.
Only Cogan knew.
Convenient.
Uh, not really.
You assassinated
the other three rebel leaders.
Explain that.
Enemies on the battlefield.
Who says so? And don't say us,
'cause I know it wasn't.
What do you mean, “us?”
Cyber Com.
How the hell does somebody like
you end up in Cyber Command?
You barely know
how to check your e-mail.
Remember the time I had to get
the porn off your...
I'm not gonna let you kill
Javier León.
Javier León?
He's not my target.
What are you talking about?
I wasn't sent to kill Javier.
I was sent to protect him.
From who?
Seriously?
You can't see it?
Marcela, the wife, and
the knuckle-dragging brother.
Riley:
He pulled the fuses.
We should be good now.
How are you holding up?
Mm. Well...
I've been in worse spots.
I'm glad I wasn't there
for those.
We're gonna get you out
with the undersecretary.
Are you okay?
I know you will.
I'll be glad when he's here.
He'll have diplomatic security
with them.
Any word from Gabriel yet?
Nothing.
I know staying back with me
and letting Gabriel
go off alone,
that had to be tough for you.
No.
No, it was the right call.
I just, you know...
Sometimes he acts before
he thinks, and I just hope...
you're worried about him.
I'm worried, too.
You're telling me Marcela's
gonna kill her own husband?
She worked for the government.
For El Presidente.
Oh, Javier doesn't have a clue.
Carrizales ordered them
to kill him.
Why?
'Cause he decided
to deal with the U.S.
It's a red line
for Carrizales' people.
So I got the order to...
Make sure Javier was protected
and the last one standing.
And when we realized Marcela
and Bro-zilla were dirty,
they got on the list.
Would you lower
the gun already?
We're on the same team, brah.
Just like old times.
If you're telling the truth,
why isn't León dead yet?
This whole thing is about the
meeting with the undersecretary.
Marcela wants him dead, too.
All right. Fine.
You don't believe me.
But, uh, your partner,
the girl...
What about her?
Well, if I'm telling the truth
and you do nothing,
she's dead, too.
Ready to gamble with her life?
Are you okay?
You've been here
for a long time.
I'm fine.
It's not every day you meet
United States undersecretary.
You look beautiful.
I'll be right out.
Okay.
Don't make me regret this.
Keep up if you can, old man.
You're nervous?
This is an important meeting.
And today is for Bolivia.
Yes. It is.
He's here.
Can you hold down the fort?
Yeah, yeah.
Sir, Riley Neal, Cyber Com.
This is señor Javier León.
Señor León, I'm Jim Sutters.
I'm the undersecretary of state
in charge
of South American affairs.
Mr. undersecretary
of state,
allow me to introduce to you
my wife, Marcela.
- It's an honor to meet you, señora.
- Marcela: Likewise.
Gun! Get down!
Riley, no!
What are you doing?
Marcela! Marcela!
Aah!
Javier: Marcela!
It's a bomb!
Marcela.
I don't understand.
You could never see, Javi.
I married you because I thought
we could lead our country.
You're like...
you're like them,
willing to whore yourself
to the United States.
I'd rather die with my feet
in the air
than live with my legs open
to these pigs.
Aah!
The guy can shoot.
Yeah.
So, are you gonna explain
to me at some point?
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine. Joy.
Riley, Norris.
Norris, Riley.
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh, you shot me.
Yeah, well, I'd shake your hand, but
I'd rather just shoot you again.
Nice meeting you, too.
So, you guys are friends now?
Besties.
Guess we're even.
Now we're even.
So, we're good?
Yeah. Guess we are.
You ready to tell me
what's up with you?
What are you talking about?
Well, first you somehow found
my burner phone,
and you memorized
the minefield?
Maybe you should start by telling me
how you ended up a paid assassin.
Uh, I'm a soldier.
A soldier.
Back in the day, they dropped us
on the battlefield
and told us who to point
our guns at.
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm doing the same exact thing.
Your turn.
What's up with you?
At some point,
you might want to think
about coming home.
Norris:
They do something to you?
No, they did something for me.
It isn't how it appears.
You put my asset at risk again.
I had no idea Norris was CIA.
He had his own handler.
Who never told us who he hired.
It was a ghost op.
It's not uncommon.
It's how we keep these things
at arm's length.
What was the directive
to Cogan?
This is the cable.
Read it yourself.
There's one sentence here.
Read it.
“Uncle Sam backs
Javier León.”
he took that mean
we wanted to eliminate
all of the competition.
Cogan was old-school.
Old-school?
Without trust,
you and I have nothing.
We've shared
a lot of things, Jeff.
Trust has never been one
of them.
You're off the clock.
Really? You think so?
I think I got it from here.
I'm never off the clock.
You know the gig.
This is 24/7.
And this is your last beer.
You sure you're okay?
How's Jameson?
He asked out the nurse.
She say yes?
What do you think?
Do you want to talk
about Norris?
Not really.
You know, at one point,
there was nobody better.
There is somebody better.
Good night, Gabriel.
Good night.
