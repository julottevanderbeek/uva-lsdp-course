Thank you,
Master Control.
- Sure.
I'd love to go up against
one of those guys.
It'd make a nice break from
those accounting cream puffs
you keep sending me.
- What branch of the service?
Nice!
Hey, look.
This is all a mistake.
I'm just a compound
interest program.
I work at a savings and loan.
I can't play these video games.
Sure you can, pal.
You look like a natural athlete
if I ever saw one.
Who, me?
Are you kidding?
I went out to check on T-bill rates,
I ran out of breath.
Hey, look. You guys are gonna make
my User, Mr Henderson, very angry.
- He's a full branch manager.
- Great. Another religious nut!
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.
Do you believe
in the Users?
Yeah, sure.
If I don't have a User,
then who wrote me?
That's what
you're doing here.
Master Control Program's
been snapping up all us
programs who believe.
If he thinks you're useful,
he takes over all your
functions so he gets bigger.
If he can't use you, he sends
you down here to the game grid
get your bits blasted.
- What's your name?
- Crom.
I'm Ram.
They'll train you
for the games, but...
I hope you make it.
Hey, what's been going on
in the other sectors?
I've been stuck here
for 200 microcycles.
It's murder out there.
You can't even travel around
in your own microcircuits...
without permission from
Master Control Program.
I mean, sending me
down here to play games.
Who does he calculate
he is?
- Yes, sir.
- I know, sir.
- I understand.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, but--
- Let me at 'em.
You think we can merge
with this memory, Bit?
Yes.
Hmm.
Now Flynn is saying
to look over in here,
but I don't see
what we're looking for.
Come on, you scuzzy data,
be in there. Come on.
Uh-oh!
We've got company.
I don't believe this.
- A Recognizer.
- Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.
There's too many!
What is this?
Aahh!
Damn it!
- Get out of here!
- Yes-yes-yes.
God, and that was
my best program.
Got a pirate program here.
Says his name's Clu.
He came into the system
with a stolen password.
We caught him trying to
raid our high-clearance memory.
No! I must've gotten
in there by mistake.
- I was simp--
Aah!
Forget it,
Mr High And Mighty Master Control.
You aren't
making me talk.
Aah!
Good evening,
Mr Dillinger.
Thank you, Peter.
You can go now.
Yes, sir.
No problem, Master C.
If you've seen one
consumer electronics show,
you've seen them all.
What's up?
- Flynn?
He's still looking for that old file.
Can't you just appropriate it?
- But he might find it.
I think we should
shut down all access...
until we find that Flynn,
just to be safe.
- Cute.
Hey, Alan. You think I could have
some of your popcorn?
Yeah, sure.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
We've had to shut down
all Group-7 personnel.
Someone with that access
has been tampering.
I hope you don't
think it's me.
- I have an abacus at home for that.
- I'm sure you understand.
It'll only be a couple of days.
What's the project you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's
a security program itself, actually.
It monitors all contacts
between our system and other systems.
Finds anything going on that's
not scheduled, it shuts it down.
Part of the
Master Control Program?
Sounds good.
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry.
I can't afford to have
an independent programmer
monitoring me.
Do you realize how many
outside systems I've gone into?
How many programs
I've appropriated?
Come on!
A couple of days.
Hi, Dr Gibbs.
Well, here goes nothing.
Yeah, interesting.
You hear what you just said?
- "Here goes nothing."
- Well, what I meant was--
Actually, what we propose to do
is to change something
into nothing and back again.
You might just as well
have said, "Here goes something,
here comes nothing."
- Right. Mm-hmm.
-
This is the big moment.
I know. This will narrow your theory
that the scanned U-V beam...
is superior to
single pulse exposure.
Let's see if we've
got the green light.
- Looks good.
- Let her rip.
This is what we've
been waiting for.
-
- Perfect!
-
- Beautiful!
A laser dismantles
the molecular structure of the object,
and molecules remain
suspended in the laser beam.
Then, when the computer
plays out the model,
the molecules fall back
into place, and voil !
Great. Can it
send me to Hawaii?
Yeah, but you've got to purchase
your program 30 days in advance.
How's it going upstairs?
Frustrating.
I had Tron almost ready...
when Dillinger cut everyone
with Group-7 access out of the system.
the system's got more bugs
than a bait store.
You gotta expect
some static.
After all, computers are just machines.
They can't think.
Some programs will
be thinking soon.
Won't that be grand?
Computers and programs will start
thinking, and the people will stop.
I'm gonna stay around,
put some data through.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Come on.
- Did you say Group-7 access?
- Yeah.
What a hassle.
I was all set.
- Did he say why?
- Something about tampering.
Tampering?
Flynn has been thinking
about breaking into the system
ever since Dillinger canned him.
And he had
Group-7 access.
Flynn had access
to you too.
- Of what?
- That Dillinger's onto him.
I don't see why I have
to do that guy any favours.
I don't know what you ever saw
in that guy, anyway.
Don't put any change in the meter.
We're gonna need it for the games.
Boy! I haven't been
here in a long time.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
Excuse me.
Do you know where Flynn is?
Yeah, he's over there
on his machine.
He's really on a roll!
One more Reco before he ties.
Another Reco and he gets
the world's record.
It's all
in the wrists.
Hey, good
to see you guys.
Nothing classes up the joint
like a clean-cut young couple.
We gotta talk.
You can't hear yourself
think in here. Come on.
- Come on.
- I'll be down in a minute.
How's the world
of serious science?
Go up ahead.
Make yourselves at home.
The best programmer
ENCOM ever saw,
and he winds up playing
space cowboy in some back room.
Okay, let me
handle this.
Go right ahead.
Have you been sneaking
into the ENCOM system?
You never were much
for small talk, were you?
- She still leave her clothes
all over the floor?
- No.
- Alan!
- I mean, not that often.
You can see why all his friends
are 14 years old.
Touch‚.
I have been doing a little hacking,
as a matter of fact.
- You did break in.
- Tried to.
If I had
a direct terminal--
Flynn, are you embezzling?
Embezzling is such
an ugly word, Mr Bradley.
No, actually, I'm trying to
get some solid evidence together.
- I don't get it.
- Okay.
Sherman, set the Way-Back
Machine for three years ago.
Kevin Flynn,
one of ENCOM's brightest young
software engineers.
sets up his own private
memory file...
and begins writing a program
for video games, invented called...
Space Paranoids.
You invented
Space Paranoids?
Paranoids, Matrix Blaster, Vice Squad--
a whole slew of'em.
I was this close to starting
my own little enterprise.
not so young, not so bright,
but very, very sneaky
Ed Dillinger.
I get nothing on there.
There's a big blank.
All right, now we take you
three months later,
Dillinger presents ENCOM
with five video games...
that he's invented.
Thus begins his meteoric rise to--
what is he now?
- Executive V.P.?
- Senior exec?
Senior exec?
Meanwhile, kids are putting
eight million quarters a week
into Paranoid machines.
I don't see a dime, except
what I squeeze outta here.
I still don't understand
why you want to break into the system.
Because, man, somewhere in one of
these memories is the evidence.
My password, Dillinger's instructions
to divert the data--
It's too late for that!
Dillinger's cut off everybody
with Group-7 access.
Wait. Wait.
What are you saying?
The guy knows
what you're up to.
Great.
You're kidding me?
Well, now there is
nothing to stop him.
It's just Dillinger and the MCP
running things from on high now.
Not if my Tron program was running.
That'd shut the system down.
You know, if your file
was in there--
Wait a minute.
If we can get in there,
I can forge us
a Group-6 access.
Ed, all I'm saying is
if our people can't get
access to their programs--
Well, you know how frustrating
it is when you're working
on a piece of research.
I sympathize, but I have data coming
from the Master Control Program...
telling me there's
something screwy going on.
That MCP, that's half
our problem right there.
The MCP is the most efficient
way of handling what we do!
User requests are
what computers are for.
Doing our business is
what computers are for!
ENCOM isn't the business
you started in your garage any more.
We're building accounts
in 30 different countries,
new defence systems.
We have one of the most sophisticated
pieces of equipment in existence.
Oh, I know all that.
Sometimes I wish I were
back in that garage.
That can be arranged, Walter.
That was uncalled for.
And our spirit remains in every program
we designed for this computer.
Walter, it's getting late.
I've got better things to do...
than to have religious
discussions with you.
I don't think
I'm cleared for this.
- I'm certainly not.
- You wanna move aside?
Give the kid
a little room.
This guy's a little
like Santa Claus.
I make these myself.
You want one?
They never should have
gotten rid of me.
- Now that is a big door.
- Shut up.
It's my fault.
I programmed you to want too much.
I was planning to
hit the Pentagon next week.
The Pentagon?
It shouldn't be harder
than any other big company.
But now this is what I get
for using humans.
Wait a minute.
I wrote you!
I've gotten 2,415 times
smarter since then.
What do you want
with the Pentagon?
With the information
I can access,
I can run things 900 to 1,200 times
better than any human.
If you think
you're superior to us--
You wouldn't want me
to dig up Flynn's file...
and read it up on a V.D.T.
at the  would you?
You wouldn't dare!
- Hi.
- Hi. Working late?
Yeah.
Okay, come here.
I'm gonna put him
at my terminal.
I'm gonna meet you
in your office upstairs.
Don't fall asleep. If and when
I activate your Tron program,
you'll only have a few minutes
to use it before Dillinger
catches the break in security.
As long as we
stay off the top floor,
Dillinger will never know
we've been in here.
Good luck, hotshot.
- Ahem.
- Flynn!
After you.
Keep those programers
out of the system,
and get me that
Chinese language file I asked for.
End of line.
- You are going to stick with me?
- What for?
You're the one who never
needed help, remember?
Come on. I'm scared of the dark.
All this technology scares me.
This way!
- When did they put this in?
- This is where I work.
I've got a direct terminal
in the laser target area.
You can stay there
all night if you have to.
Like a man says,
"There's no problems, only solutions."
Okay, remember,
this laser is my life's work.
Don't spill anything.
Huh?
Hey, it's the big Master Control Program
everybody's been talking about.
Sit right there.
Make yourself comfortable.
Stop! Please.
How are you gonna run
the universe if you can't answer
a few unsolvable problems?
Come on, big fella,
let's see what you've got.
You don't look a thing
like your pictures.
I'm warning you,
you're entering a big error, Flynn.
I'm gonna have to
put you on the game grid.
Games? You want games?
I'll give you games.
Oh, man, this isn't happening.
It only thinks it's happening.
I said, move!
Aah!
Hey!
Look, if this is about
those parking tickets,
I can explain
everything, okay?
Prepare all programs
for war games.
It's a tough case, but but I want him
treated in the usual manner.
Train him
for the games,
let him hope for a while,
then blow him away.
You got it.
I've been hoping you'd send me
somebody with a little bit of guts.
What kind
of program is he?
He's not any kind of program,
Sark, he's a User.
- A User?
Somebody pushes me, I push back.
So I brought him down here.
Well, I--
I was just--
I don't know.
A User, I mean--
Users wrote us.
A User even wrote you!
No one User wrote me.
I'm worth millions of their man-years.
What if I can't?
Wait! I need that!
Then pull yourself together.
Get this clown trained.
I want him in the games
until he dies playing. Acknowledge.
Acknowledged,
Master Control.
Video game unit 1 8.
In here, program.
Who you calling
program, program?
New guy?
Another free program
off-line.
You really think the Users
are still there?
They'd better be.
I don't wanna bust out of here
and find nothing but a lot of
cold circuits waiting for me.
Hey.
- Who are you guys?
- Hold it!
You wanna watch
those force fields.
Look, just so I can
tell my friends...
what this dream is about,
okay, where am I?
You're a...
guest of the
Master Control Program.
Oh, great.
- They're gonna make you
play video games.
I play video games
better than anybody.
Move out!
This way.
You, you come this way.
There's been a mistake.
I've gotta see the guy in charge.
You will.
Command Program Sark's
carrier is approaching.
Greetings.
The Master Control Program
has chosen you...
will receive the standard
substandard training,
which will result in
your eventual elimination.
this superstitious
and hysterical belief,
of the MCP.
Everything
you do or learn...
will be imprinted
on this disk.
you will be subject
to immediate de-resolution.
That will be all.
Hey, who's that guy?
That's Tron.
He fights for the Users.
Tron?
- Watch this.
You gotta be good
if you wanna survive.
- My name's Ram.
Hey, Ram,
what were you,
you know, before?
I was an actuarial program.
Really gives you
a great feeling...
helping folks plan
for their future needs.
Of course, if you think of the payments
as an annuity over the years,
the cost is really
quite minimal.
Yeah, that's great.
Actuarial program.
Nice.
How about yourself?
Oh, I don't remember
too much.
Name's Flynn.
Sure, a little disorientation,
that's normal in transport.
It'll come back to you.
This is it.
Good luck, Flynn.
Sir, conscript being moved
from pit cell to ring game.
You know-- Hey!
You guys sure
are friendly.
Wait.
Let him fight
one of his own kind.
You think you're gonna
wipe me out, don't you?
No, I--
Hey! I--
The new guy
was asking about you.
It's too bad
he's in a match now.
I'll probably
never meet him.
You might. There's something
different about him.
Okay.
That was
a very fancy shot.
Okay, here's
an easy one.
Finish the game!
- No!
- Kill him.
No.
You'll regret this.
Aah!
This is the holding area
for the lightcycles.
- Hey, Flynn, you made it!
- Wait here.
- You won!
- Alan.
Where did you hear
that name?
- That's your name, isn't it?
- The name of my User.
How did you know?
I'm a program from
a User that knows Alan.
He was disoriented
in transport, Tron.
But I'm remembering
all kinds of stuff,
like my User wants me
to go after the MCP.
My User wants that too.
I know.
Wow.
- Aah!
This is it.
Come on.
Gold-3 to Gold-2 and 1.
I'm getting out of here now
and you guys are invited.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Aah!
Greetings, programs!
- Gold-2 to Gold-3.
Get them!
Send out every
game tank in the grid.
Get them!
Targets leaving
protective field.
Missed!
All units
exiting game arena.
Target units
accelerating!
Pursuit force minus one tank.
Close ranks.
Oh, man.
On the other side
of the screen,
it all looked
so easy.
They must've gone
right past us.
We made it...
this far.
Get the pursuit forces
back into the canyons.
Those programs never made it out.
We'll have them back in no time, sir,
long before the interrupt interface.
We'd better, null unit.
I'll be lucky if the MCP
doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
I want those conscripts!
Look at that.
When do we pay our visit
to the old Master Control?
What?
There's just
three of us.
Well, if you know anybody who's got
an army for rent, that's fine,
but my User told me
to go take that sucker out,
or I'm never getting
out of here.
We can't
to the MCP...
without the help
of  User.
I have to get to
that input/output tower,
Well, good. Check in with Alan.
Maybe he knows what's--
That... is just...
what I need right now.
Oh, it's nice.
Incredible.
until you get
to a pure source.
My friends, my fellow conscripts,
we have scored.
I feel so much better.
Pursuit force reporting.
No sign of escaped units.
Moving into next sector.
- Thank you.
- I can feel it.
Feel what?
You okay?
Alan-1.
Let's move out!
Come on, Flynn,
put a cork in it.
One second!
Ahhh!
Range, 9.
Mark, 45.
Hold it.
Pursuit force reporting.
Two escaped units de-rezzed.
No!
Tron unit heading
into next sector.
Ram?
Ram!
Continue pursuit of
remaining conscript.
We're gonna make it, Ram.
I just gotta find you
a place to rest.
Hang in there, Ram.
This looks like a good spot.
Those tanks
won't find us here.
Okay.
I thought this was
supposed to be easy.
Hey, what's going on?
You see this?
You shouldn't
be able to do that.
Now for some
real User power.
Hey, this looks promising.
This is just like
the old arcade grips.
Let's get this
show on the road.
Now we're smokin'!
- We'll get you fixed up. Hang on.
- Come here.
Oh, my User!
Users are Users.
They--
Are you a User?
Flynn,
help Tron.
Ram!
Ram!
Damn Recognizer.
Thing just goes straight.
What's the progress
on the simulation?
are correct.
Limited four and eight
are missing.
Don't scream.
Yori!
are correct.
Limited four and eight
are missing.
No, I--
Tron!
Oh!
Yori.
I knew you'd escape.
They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.
Listen!
We have to make plans.
Where can we go?
This way, quickly.
Hey!
Hold it right there!
- Yes?
Yes.
Is that all
you can say?
No.
- Anything else?
Positive and negative, huh?
You're a bit.
Where's your program?
Isn't he gonna miss you?
- No.
- I'm your program.
- Yes.
- Another mouth to feed.
Watch out
for nested macros.
- Who are these weirdos?
- Inoperative data pushers.
Control programs! Come on.
Pretty good drivin',
huh? Oh!
- Who asked you?
Aah!
- This baby doesn't
handle so good in town.
- What's this do?
How 'bout this one?
- Aah!
- We gotta stop this thing!
Uh, I'm fine.
No problem.
Oh, this town
is full of live ones.
This is where Tron
said he was going.
Losing Flynn.
I don't believe this.
Halt!
More guards.
They don't see us.
I'll go first.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Let's do
that some more.
I think the guard saw me.
Come on!
- Halt.
- Dumont.
I can't stand this commotion.
What do you want?
I've come to communicate
with my User.
Difficult proposition.
Difficult proposition at best.
They hate this tower.
They'd close it down if they dared.
They keep me around
just in case one of them...
wants to deal with the other world
once in a while.
Dumont!
My User has information
that could--
could make this
a free system again.
-
You'd have programs
lined up to use this place,
and no MCP looking
over your shoulder.
When you've been in the system
as long as I have,
you hear many promises,
many reassurances,
- Please, Dumont!
The guards are coming.
There they are
with the guardian.
All right, Yori.
All right.
Who is your User, program?
Alan-1 .
He calls me.
May I pass?
All that is visible...
must grow beyond itself,
and extend into
the realm of the invisible.
You may pass, my friend.
The tower guardian
is helping him.
He thinks.
Bring in
the logic probe.
It's begun.
Confirmed, Alan-1.
This is the key
to a new order.
This code disk
means freedom.
I think they're
breaking in.
- Thank you, Dumont.
- Hurry! The Users are waiting.
Dumont?
Where's the program?
What program?
Take him!
Stay close.
If I can just get us
on the scanning transport beam,
this solar sail simulation
will take us across the game sea,
out of this domain,
back into the central computer.
Look out!
Aah!
Aah!
We did take care of
that User you sent us.
We'll get them.
It's only a matter of time.
You've almost reached
your decision gate,
- It's me-- Flynn!
- Flynn!
- Greetings, program.
- You're alive!
Where's Ram?
He didn't make it.
Come on.
Lora.
This is Flynn.
The one who busted me out.
Lora?
Well, then I
owe him some thanks.
I ought to know my way around
the Lightcycle. I wrote the program.
- You wrote the program?
- I'm what you guys call a User.
- You're a User?
I took a wrong turn
somewhere.
If you are a User,
everything you've done has been
according to a plan, right?
You wish.
You keep doing what it looks
like you're supposed to,
no matter how crazy it seems.
That's the way it is
for programs, yes.
Hate to disappoint you, pal,
but most of the time, that's
the way it is for Users too.
Stranger and stranger.
So, nice-looking ship
you got here.
What do you want done with
the tower guardian-- Dumont?
Put him with
the others?
No, bit brain, prepare
him for inquisition.
I need a little bit
of relaxation.
First, rezz up
the carrier for pursuit.
One other thing.
Don't think any more.
I do the thinking
around here.
Had enough?
What do you want?
I'm busy.
Busy dying, you worn out
excuse for an old program.
Yes, I'm old.
Old enough to remember the MCP
when it was a chess program.
Very funny, Dumont. Maybe I should
keep you around just to make me laugh.
- What's happening?
- Power surge in the MCP.
- I can't.
There isn't another junction
for seven or eight nanoseconds.
- There's another beam!
- It's too far.
He's creating a junction.
Did we make it?
Yeah.
Hooray for our side.
Is he de-rezzing?
I'm all in one piece.
I guess
I'm still with you.
Tell the guy
with the jackhammer to lay off.
- How'd you do that?
- Elementary physics--
a beam of energy
can always be diverted.
Are we there yet, Mommy?
Sark!
- Dumont!
- Yori!
Tron?
Tron's dead.
He came here to help us.
If the Users can no longer
help us, we're lost.
So, we have erased
that program--
No.
- Not me, Sark.
There's nothing special about you.
You're just an ordinary program.
So are you, one that
should have been erased.
You're nothing.
Take that program
to the holding pit.
Please, don't take--
and some other religious
fanatics to Master Control.
When I disembark,
this ship and everything
that remains on board...
will automatically de-rezz.
This means you.
Move on!
Immediate vectors
detached.
Route us
to the MCP.
I want to get rid
of this dead weight,
These walls--
Yori, something's happening.
Hey.
You all right?
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.
Leave me alone.
We've failed.
We're only gonna fail if we give up!
Come on, look, the wall!
Yori.
You brought me back.
How? Why did
you bring me back?
I need your help.
Come on!
Do something with
these controls!
I'm on it.
The MCP, it's the heart
of the whole system.
I feel a presence.
Another warrior is on the mesa.
We're getting closer.
I don't know
how you survived.
Prepare to terminate.
But in moments, you will
no longer seek communication...
You will each be part of me.
Together, we will be complete.
- You're very persistent.
- I'm also better than you.
Sark?
Sark?
Look at that!
Your User can't help you now,
my little program.
I got it.
Steer us over by the beam.
What good will that do?
I'm gonna jump.
It's the only way

Thanks.
Greetings, programs.
