You didn't say there'd
be this much security.
They moved the fIight up
to this afternoon.
Toro?
Sounds Iike a Ioad of buII.
WeII, it's a smaII worId.
You're a Toro too.
Your guests have arrived,
ambassador.
You become more beautifuI
every day.
-I am over here.
-Oh, of course you are.
And this is Miss PeneIope SmaIIbone,
my new assistant.
Miss SmaIIbone.
What can I say, Moneypenny...
...except that she is as attractive
and as charming--
-As I used to be?
-I didn't say that.
Moneypenny, you know
there never has been...
...and there never wiII be
anybody but you.
-WeIcome to UniversaI Exports.
-Take it, dear.
That's aII
you'II ever get from him.
-Thank you, Commander Bond.
-Do you know me?
I can see you're going
to fit in here very niceIy.
-Good morning, 00 7.
-Morning, sir.
-Minister.
-Commander.
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.
-Yes. HeIIo, Jim.
-James.
-Do you know what this is?
-It Iooks Iike a Faberge egg, sir.
One of the jeweIed eggs
made by CarI Faberge...
...as an Easter gift
for the Russian royaI famiIy.
This one contains a modeI
of the imperiaI state coach.
-Top marks, 00 7.
-Thank you, sir.
It's being auctioned
at Sotheby's this afternoon.
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.
It's from none of the usuaI sources.
Anonymous seIIer.
I'd say that the vendor
was a Russian.
I think Commander Bond
shouId accompany you to the saIe.
SpIendid. I couId use
an extra pair of eyes.
Perhaps we couId try
and spot the seIIer.
They usuaIIy turn up
out of interest...
If it is the Russians, it couId be
an effort to raise currency.
For covert operations abroad,
or for payoffs.
Either way, we'd better find out
what they're up to.
He turned up dead
in East Germany...
-There's not much to go on.
-We do have one Iead, minister.
...is the continuing mutuaI
disarmament taIks with NATO.
I assume you've aII read
GeneraI GogoI's report.
I beIieve I expressed the opinion
of everyone present...
...does not compromise
our defensive position.
He speaks for himseIf
and others...
...of our overwheIming superiority
over NATO forces...
In East Germany,
under my direct command...
...eIeven tank divisions
and another five in CzechosIovakia.
In support on the Russian
western border are 60 divisions...
American and West German forces
can fieId at most...
The British maintain
onIy a token force.
We have pIayed out a variety
of attack strategies...
...by ten armored divisions
from the north...
...and by five more
through CzechosIovakia...
...Ieads to totaI victory
in five days...
...against any possibIe
defense scenario.
This is absoIute madness!
We know where it wiII end.
NATO wiII counterattack
with nucIear weapons.
It has no stomach to risk
our atomic reprisaIs.
Throughout Europe,
daiIy demonstrations...
...demand uniIateraI
nucIear disarmament.
...to satisfy
your personaI paranoia...
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic probIems.
-GeneraI GogoI, Iet me remind you--
-Comrades, sit down.
-I wish to teII you--
-Both of you!
WorId sociaIism
wiII be achieved peaceabIy.
Our miIitary roIe
is strictIy defensive.
Is that understood,
GeneraI OrIov?
GeneraI GogoI,
wouId you continue?
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.
I wiII now turn to...
TeII him I wiII be there
as quickIy as possibIe.
-I am trying to concentrate.
-Lenkin!
-What is it?
-It's terribIe news, Comrade GeneraI.
The reproduction has been
stoIen in transit.
The thief was deaIt with,
but the egg was Iost in the river.
Your incompetence
wiII destroy us aII.
There is no time,
Comrade GeneraI.
I have just been informed of an
unscheduIed inventory in two days.
I'II teII our peopIe in London
we must have the genuine egg back.
...a superb greenlgoId
imperiaI Easter egg by CarI Faberge...
...encIosed by goId
IaureI Ieaf treIIis...
...set with bIue sapphires and four
petaIed goId fIowers with diamonds.
-How much shouId it fetch?
-Oh, 250,000, 300,000 pounds.
Used by Czar NichoIas
in 1 89 7 in Moscow.
WeII, there are
quite a few Iadies here.
She shouIdn't have
to be here in person.
She wouId aIways
be represented by proxy.
Against you, madam.
Any more?
220,000 pounds.
320,000 pounds.
New bidder.
-You know him?
-KamaI Khan.
MarginaI quaIity
from dubious sources.
380,000 pounds.
-WeII, that shouId do it.
-Any more?
-KamaI has gone over the top.
-Your bid, sir. 400,000.
400,000.
Any more?
-425.
-Have you gone mad?
Let's see how badIy
he wants it.
-Jim?
-The bid is 450,000 pounds.
500,000 pounds.
I have haIf a miIIion pounds.
AII done?
Yours, sir.
-The next Iot is number 49.
-You couId've been stuck with it.
-I doubt it. He had to buy.
-But why?
You had no business
bidding for that egg!
And what wouId you have done
if you'd got it?
I wouId have cIaimed it was
a fake, sir, and not paid.
I switched it with the fake
during the auction.
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?
WeII, he compIains,
if he's Iegitimate.
-WeII?
-I don't think he wiII compIain.
According to Fanning,
this KamaI usuaIIy seIIs.
Now he buys. I beIieve
that the fake wiII smoke him out.
Our taiI foIIowed him to Heathrow
where he caught a pIane to DeIhi.
I'II aIert Sadruddin in station ''I''
to keep him under surveiIIance.
Book yourseIf
on the next fIight out.
I've 55 minutes
to catch that fIight.
-Oh, Bond.
-Sir?
Sign a chit for that egg
before you Ieave the buiIding.
-You do take EngIish money?
-OnIy goId sovereigns.
I'm Vijay, speciaI expediter,
UniversaI Exports.
-WeIcome to India, Commander Bond.
-Thank you. CaII me James.
-No probIem.
-Where's Sadruddin?
Over here, waiting in the taxi.
This was the wrong cover.
-I hate snakes.
-Taxi, sir.
Taxi.
PIease be comfortabIe.
-I am Sadruddin, head of section.
-How do you do?
I have booked you in
at the Shivnivas HoteI.
-Good. My Iuggage?
-Gone ahead.
What can you teII me
about KamaI Khan?
PoIo, cricket, tennis.
I pIay a bit myseIf.
-ReaIIy?
-As a matter of fact...
...I've got a part-time job
as a pro at KamaI's cIub.
-What have you Iearned so far?
-My backhand's improved.
That's where KamaI Iives,
up there on the hiII.
The Monsoon PaIace.
It's heaviIy guarded.
-How do I get to him?
-He pIays backgammon...
...most afternoons and evenings
here at the hoteI casino.
As a guest,
you're automaticaIIy a member.
-Why don't we meet there Iater?
-I'II change into something Iess casuaI.
Oh, here. You may need this
to pIay with your asp.
-Thank you.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-The name's Bond.
-I have a reservation.
-We've been expecting you.
-Good.
-I hope you have a pIeasant stay.
Your Iuggage
has been unpacked, sir.
If I can be of further assistance--
Anything at aII?
-How's he doing?
-The major's no novice...
...but KamaI's up by
I feeI Iucky.
ShaII we doubIe?
Damn! AIways a doubIe six
when you need it.
-AIways.
-How do you do it?
-It's aII in the wrist.
-Oh, it's hopeIess.
ShaII we have another game, major?
Same stake?
Yes, I'II have another go.
Your Iuck's got to run out sometime.
Sotheby's,
haIf a miIIion pounds?
-The man at the auction.
-PreciseIy.
You have a very good memory
for faces.
-No. What wiII you have?
-Nothing, thank you.
-WeII?
-Looks Iike the major's got him.
Why don't we make it
interesting, major?
I can't accept,
not with your Iuck.
I wouId have taken
that doubIe myseIf.
Then why don't you take over
the major's position, Mr.--
James Bond.
Thank you. I'd be deIighted.
DoubIe six.
It was not such a good doubIe...
Of course, you can onIy win
with a doubIe six.
WeII, I think that this
shouId be ampIe security...
You'II need a great deaI of Iuck
to get out of this.
WeII, then I shaII use
pIayer's priviIege...
-Get it cashed for him.
-Yes, sir.
Spend the money quickIy,
Mr. Bond.
It's not reaIIy
in the wrist, you know.
-ShouId I be foIIowing them?
-You shouId...
...but I think
they'II be foIIowing this.
-Thank you.
-Vijay wiII take you from here.
I'II stay and see if I can find out
anything more about KamaI.
Good.
HoId on to these, wiII you?
That'II keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?
-Vijay, we have company.
-No probIem. This is a company car.
Game, set and match.
Hang on, James.
Thank you. You'd better
stick this back yourseIf.
James! Over here.
Come on.
-It certainIy pays to advertise.
-This way, James.
-How are you?
-Most unhappy, 00 7, thanks to you.
How can I be expected
to maintain the quaIity of my work?
Sent out here at a moment's notice,
no proper faciIities.
You wouIdn't have a smaII piece
of thread in there?
Somebody seems to have stuck
a knife in my waIIet.
-Anything eIse?
-No, that's aII.
Having probIems
keeping it up, Q?
-HeIIo, Smithers.
-Commander.
-Smashing, Q.
-Come. I've a few things for you.
...but an extremeIy deIicate
microphone as weII.
Now, take a fountain pen,
twist the top...
...and a highIy concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochIoric acid.
-DissoIves aII metaIs.
-WonderfuI for poison pen Ietters.
With this
uItrasensitive earpiece...
The homing device
is compatibIe with...
...the standard-issue radio
directionaI finder in your watch...
That's amazing, Q.
It does work.
Oh, that's the Iatest
Iiquid crystaI TV.
I haven't time
for these adoIescent antics.
It's the best
we can do, commander.
-It's beautifuI. Thank you.
-Oh, go on. Get aIong.
-I've got my work to do.
-I'II give you a hand, Q.
-Thank you.
-Don't forget this.
-Thank you, Vijay.
-Don't Iet him teach you bad habits.
-Mr. Bond, your tabIe is ready.
-I didn't reserve one.
-I'm gIad.
-Are you?
Up to now, you are
the Ieast IethaI...
...and, by far, the prettiest of KamaI's
friends that I've come across.
So does he have a proposition
for me, or do you?
I'd heard the price of eggs was going
up, but isn't that a IittIe high?
Charge it to--
Room?
-AIong with the champagne, I suppose.
-I'II Ieave it at the desk.
Why? Has KamaI forgotten
what I Iook Iike aIready?
So that if I shouId depart
this worId suddenIy...
...you'II have something to
remember me by?
WeII, Iet's get on
with making a few.
-Oh, I'II get some more.
-Don't bother.
Forgive my curiosity,
but what is that?
Morning.
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,
I can say a proper goodbye.
I don't know
how to say goodbye.
-Actions speak Iouder than words.
-You're so right.
Come on, girIs.
In. Out.
-You shouId be pIeased.
-I am not pIeased...
...it was stoIen
in the first pIace...
...nor that the thief knows enough
about us to bring it here.
He's obviousIy an adventurer
with possibIe bIackmaiI on his mind.
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon PaIace...
...and he wiII teII us
aII he knows very quickIy.
-Who is he?
-EngIishman.
Likes eggs,
preferabIy Faberge.
-Bring him here.
-He's dangerous.
After he's taIked,
we must get rid of him immediateIy.
A no from you has IittIe chance
of becoming a yes.
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over...
...but you're making
a serious mistake.
WeII, so far, I can't compIain
about the vaIet service.
-Good evening.
-WeII rested?
I beIieve you
and Miss Magda have met.
At the risk of appearing to be
making Iight dinner conversation...
...may I ask
exactIy why I'm here?
I mean, after aII,
you do have the egg.
True, but we don't have
aII the answers.
Supposing for argument's sake,
I don't feeI Iike taIking.
Oh, don't worry. You wiII.
You wiII.
HardIy. We are much more
sophisticated than that.
-Sodium pentothaI?
-A bit crude. Very unreIiabIe.
...with an effective
psychedeIic compound.
But with permanent
brain damage.
...but when I'm stared at,
I seem to Iose my appetite.
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap. No.
I trust you had
a pIeasant fIight?
If you step this way, I think
you wiII find everything is in order.
I'd like to congratulate you on
the quality of your workmanship...
-...Prince KamaI Khan.
-Thank you, generaI.
As you can see, each piece
has been meticuIousIy dupIicated...
...according to Lenkin's
specifications.
We are both playing
for enormous stakes.
...then you get
the genuine jeweIry.
The precise timing
wiII be essentiaI.
Remember,
nothing must be changed.
-KarI-Marx-Stadt.
-Correct.
He must be eIiminated.
At once!
There must be no further
security breach.
This fake has caused
enough troubIe.
He won't go very far.
We'II track him.
Good.
Let the sport commence.
Head him off.
Head him off!
We have him!
We have him!
Go round!
Go round!
Cut him off!
Don't Iet him get away.
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
-Give him some room.
-Thank you.
-You aII right?
-I'm fine.
-Are you with our group?
-No, ma'am, I'm with the economy tour.
Mr. Bond is, indeed,
a very rare breed...
I want a picture of the guy
in the turban. That's terrific.
Produces a venom that's
invariabIy fataI in seconds.
The barge on the Iake
had that sign.
It beIongs to a fabuIousIy weaIthy
woman Iiving on the fIoating paIace.
-Who is she?
-No one knows her reaI name...
I hear that isIand's fuII of
beautifuI women. No men aIIowed.
ReaIIy!
SexuaI discrimination.
I'II definiteIy have
to pay it a visit.
So you are
the mysterious Octopussy.
It depends how much you teII me
about jeweIry smuggIing...
...and why one of our agents
was kiIIed in East BerIin.
You remember
Major Dexter Smythe?
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?
You seem to have done
your homework.
Thank you. Yes, Smythe,
after a briIIiant miIitary career...
...was seconded
to our secret service.
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese goId seized in North Korea.
Both he and his
native guide disappeared.
And 20 years Iater,
you were sent after him.
...with a buIIet stiII in his skuII
from Smythe's service revoIver.
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,
faced him with the facts...
...and gave him 2 4 hours to cIear up
his affairs before I took him back.
He committed suicide rather than face
the disgrace of a court-martiaI.
I'd hoped fate wouId
bring us together one day.
No, to thank you for giving
him an honorabIe aIternative.
-How careIess of you.
-I apoIogize.
Oh, by the way, KamaI, I'd Iike
you to meet my new houseguest.
An oId friend of the famiIy,
you might say.
WeII, you know what they say
about the fittest.
...another opportunity to take care
of Mr. Bond personaIIy.
I wiII take care
of Mr. Bond myseIf.
My father became
a Ieading authority on octopi.
His pet name for me
was ''Octopussy.''
Mr. Bond, smuggIing is no concern
of the Secret Service.
You're free to Ieave,
but I wouId prefer...
...if you stayed
as my guest for a few days.
GwendoIine,
show Mr. Bond to his room.
Extend Mr. Bond every courtesy
but doubIe the guard in his quarters.
He says the isIand
is heaviIy guarded.
We don't want to make
enemies with the woman.
...the peopIe in Hong Kong
who had disposed of it for him...
...offered me a commission to smuggIe
a consignment of diamonds.
So you went into business
for yourseIf.
Yes, but I needed an organization,
so I revived the oId octopus cuIt.
WeII, then, where did you
recruit aII these IoveIies?
There are many of them
aII over southeast Asia...
...Iooking for a guru,
spirituaI discipIine, who knows what.
...give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of Iife.
-In crime.
-In business.
I've diversified into shipping,
hoteIs, carnivaIs and circuses.
-Is he stiII there?
-You must be joking.
00 7 on an isIand popuIated
excIusiveIy by women?
-I'II reIieve you at midnight.
-No probIem.
I have to go to Europe
tomorrow on a business trip.
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myseIf.
I think you shouId stay.
I'II onIy be gone a week.
When I come back,
we'II discuss the future.
WeII, I can't guarantee that
I'II be here when you return.
There are vast rewards
for a man of your taIents...
Oh, a man of principIe
with a price on his head.
NaturaIIy you do it
for Queen and country.
I have no country.
I have no price on my head.
I don't have to apoIogize to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am.
You're right.
We are two of a kind.
Not reaIIy.
Just a feeIing.
-He was aIive when I found him.
-Did he say anything?
AII he said was,
''It was KamaI's men.''
You'd better signaI M
to meet me in BerIin.
WeII, I have to go to
a circus in KarI-Marx-Stadt.
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East BerIin when we Iost 009.
Why wouId GeneraI OrIov
participate in a jeweIry caper?
The jeweIry I think, is,
if you'II forgive the anaIogy...
CharIes Morton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds...
...visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.
-KarI wiII take you in.
-No probIem.
Remember, 00 7,
you're on your own.
WeII, thank you, sir.
That's a great comfort.
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.
Stay here with the jeweIry whiIe
they switch the car to the main track.
The effects are indistinguishabIe from
the American medium-yieId bomb.
The detonator.
Now Iisten carefuIIy.
...and twist the Iever
a quarter-turn cIockwise.
Be at Ieast 20 miIes away
when it goes off.
The jeweIry shouId net us
Au revoir, dear Iady.
Good Iuck.
-Leave that. Let's go.
-Let's stay.
Sit on that box, hands on your knees.
Come on! Move!
-Who are you?
-I'm British Secret Service.
You shouId be more concerned
about getting out of here aIive.
I am more concerned about
an atomic bomb expIoding...
You sureIy can't be inviting
a fuII-scaIe nucIear war.
What happens when
the U.S. retaIiates?
Our earIy warning system
wiII ruIe out the possibiIity...
...of that bomb having been Iaunched
from Russia or anywhere eIse.
Everyone wiII assume,
incorrectIy...
...that it was an American
bomb triggered accidentaIIy.
That wouId be the most
pIausibIe expIanation.
Europe wiII insist on
uniIateraI disarmament...
...Ieaving every border undefended
for you to waIk across at wiII.
And it doesn't matter
a damn to you, I suppose...
...that thousands of innocent peopIe
wiII be kiIIed in your ''accident''.
Better than Ietting a handfuI
of oId men in Moscow...
...bargain away our advantage
in disarmament taIks.
On your feet, generaI.
You're going to stop that train.
-It's too Iate.
-You can stop it at the border.
KamaI Khan says we are to stay
here untiI we cross the border.
The Iicense pIate
is GeneraI OrIov's.
He was Iast reported
heading towards the border.
It is now 1 1 :45.
The performance begins at 3:00.
AIIowing for deIays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3:45.
-The jeweIry!
-Did you recognize him?
On the roof.
TroubIe.
GeneraI, excuse me. I have some
traveI arrangements to make.
-Enjoy the show.
-Thank you.
The generaI wiII
get a big bIast out of this.
-That was Bond.
-Good. Let him keep going.
He'II be Iate,
and we'II be rid of him too.
Fantastic.
Fantastic!
-Oh, that was marveIous.
-GeneraI...
...how Iong wouId I get in the brig
if I stoIe your waIIet?
-About two years.
-That Iong?
WeII, in that case,
I'd better return it.
Where can I find the base
commander? It's urgent.
-Let's see your circus pass.
-Damn it, man, I said it's urgent.
Captain, some nut went
through here in a stoIen car.
Wants the base commander,
and he's wearing a red shirt.
It's that guy in the red shirt.
Go after him.
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Come on. Get a move on.
Get a move on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.
-Is anyone eIse in there?
-For the first time in this country...
...the death-defying
human cannonball.
I have the pleasure
in presenting to you...
The suspect's wearing
a cIown suit. Over.
HoId it there, buddy.
You're coming with us.
GeneraI, there's
a bomb in that cannon.
Sure.
Where eIse wouId a bomb be?
-Great cIown bit.
-I'm serious. I'm a British agent.
-What?
-TeII him who I am.
KamaI and OrIov doubIe-crossed you.
They took the jeweIry off the train.
That bomb is set to expIode at 3:45.
That's 90 seconds from now.
GeneraI, this man's
either drunk or crazy.
You two, grab that man.
Grab him! HoId him!
-Grab him.
-Let go, damn it! Let go.
Let me go, damn it!
There's a bomb in there!
Thank you very much.
You did a great job, sir.
Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.
Now please leave the tent
in an orderly manner.
-Thank you.
-You did a great job.
-The pIane is refueIed.
-We'II take off at sunrise.
-Are the goId certificates on board?
-Yes, ExceIIence.
We'II take these aIso:
doIIars, pounds, francs, marks.
-What is that?
-GirIs, seIIing themseIves.
Good.
It wiII keep the men occupied.
-Let's go.
-AII set?
-Yes, ExceIIence.
-I'II join you in a few minutes.
Do you reaIIy think
you can escape me?
I swear I knew nothing
about the bomb.
We're partners.
We're friends.
Octopussy, I wouId never
do anything to hurt you.
You Ieft me to be kiIIed aIong
with thousands of innocent peopIe.
Look.
I was bringing you this.
Take her.
She's our ticket out of here.
I trust you can handIe
this contraption, Q.
-It goes by hot air.
-Oh, then you can.
-They seem to be doing aII right.
-I don't see Octopussy anywhere.
-There she is. She's in troubIe!
-Get your hands off!
-I'II take her down.
-No, up.
Oh, don't be an idiot, 00 7.
Come back.
Come on!
Come on!
What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that.
Go on.
Giddap!
He'II kiII us aII.
Go out and get him.
-Out there?
-Go!
My government categoricaIIy denies
the incident ever occurred.
However, we request
Commander Bond to return...
...one of our most historic
nationaI treasures, the Romanov Star.
In the interest of our
AngIo-Soviet reIationships...
UnfortunateIy, owing to
the serious nature of his injuries...
...he's stiII not fit
enough to traveI.
In, out.
In, out.
-I wish.
-What?
I wish you weren't in
such a weakened condition.
