Coulson: Previously on
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
Ward: Now you know how
it feels, Coulson ...
to watch someone you care for
bleed out right in front of you.
No! No!
Ward, what did you do?
Agent Mackenzie, to take Ward
out, I need to cross some lines
the director of
S.H.I.E.L.D. shouldn't cross.
- What, you want me to fill in?
- As acting director until it's finished.
Hunter: Trace puts Ward in
the Southwest of England.
They're at the castle where
we brought Simmons back.
Which would explain why
he kidnapped her and Fitz.
'Cause Malick's trying
to open another portal.
It wants to come back.
And finally, after all these years,
we found someone to help us do that.
We can't let them bring that
thing back to this planet!
I lost you once.
I can't lose you again.
Only thing I'm gonna
bring back is Will. Okay?
Find it, get to the exit coordinates,
we'll turn the portal back
on in exactly 12 hours.
Be the one that finishes
what Hydra started.
Coulson: Looks like
they're getting ready.
- That's Ward.
- Bobbi: He's going through.
Coulson, wait!
Shut it down.
Is something wrong?
Fitz.
- Go ahead and scout that ridge.
- Yes sir.
We have less than six hours
to find the next portal and go home.
Why don't you shut the hell
up so I can concentrate?
This program's a work in
progress, designed from
Simmons' limited data and
hypothetical calculations.
See?
Our exit location is determined
- by the position of the ...
- Just figure it out.
Aah!
Let me be clear...
...if I don't make it back,
Simmons will be killed...
slowly, horribly.
It'd all be your fault.
Is that what you want?
What do you want?
Why are we here?
Find some ancient, mythical creature.
Wake up, Ward.
This is a snark hunt,
and the only reason Malick sent you
is because you're expendable.
Move.
Move!
Is that...
Hail Hydra.

One of you want to tell me
what Coulson was thinking
jumping out of the Quinjet like that?
I would say he wasn't so
much thinking as feeling ...
- feeling that Ward needs to die.
- And you didn't try to stop him.
Full disclosure ...
I was planning on jumping, as well.
Again, less thinking than feeling.
Coulson went there to get our people.
"Our people" ...
what are you talking about?
We believe that Ward
took Fitz or Simmons
through the portal with him.
Hopefully, Coulson can find
them and bring them back safely.
All we have to do is
take control of the castle
and open the portal so they can return.
So, just take the ultra-fortified
Hydra castle and open the
alien portal. That's it?
You know, you're wired
different than most folks.
I'm not saying it'll be easy.
I wouldn't mind hearing
it's gonna be easy.
- It'll be easy.
- Doesn't work if I know you're lying.
Daisy: Mack ... or, director,
you guys should get up here.
This is Hydra's compound
outside the castle.
And these two trucks were just unloaded.
Lincoln: What are they
bringing in now? More weapons?
Inhumans.
They're stockpiling Inhumans.
That's how I read it.
Looks like 10 or 12 of
those gel-matrix containers.
Andrew ... he's probably
down there, as well.
Okay. So, are we rescuing
Inhumans or saving Coulson
or attacking Hydra
or is there some kind of combo?
Sorry.
New guy just trying to understand
how this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. thing works.
This is how S.H.I.E.L.D. works.
You make a plan, plan turns to rubbish,
we make a new plan.
Oh, just to be crystal clear,
this is the part where
the plan turns to rubbish.
Whatever the new plan, we need to
make sure those Inhumans are safe.
And find Fitz and Simmons.
And we get Coulson
back through the portal.
Would everyone just shut up a second?
Even cloaked, Hydra's missiles
will find us if we get too close.
And I will not be the one
who has to tell Coulson
we got his fancy new plane blown up.
Now, the only way to take the castle
and secure the portal is on the Q.T.
That means no gunfire and no backup.
We leave all tactical support up here.
Is that clear?
Two infiltration teams ...
one to search the compound
for Fitz or Simmons
and one to secure the portal.
We'll take care of everyone,
including the Inhumans,
but first things first. Go.
Satellite's at your disposal.
Find us a back door, tremors.
The cargo's here.
All Inhuman systems
are stable and online.
- The team is ready to revive them.
- Patience, Mr. Giyera.
They're not our toys to play with.
They're presents for our friend
once grant Ward brings it back.
Every general needs an army.
So, how long do we have
once the portal reopens?
- 73 seconds.
- Simmons: He's wrong.
Your team's calculations are off at 61.
but on that planet,
it can be the difference
between life and death.
- Thank you.
- I'm not doing it for you.
Don't want you all
mucking up Fitz's return.
Did you notice the Hebrew word
"Maveth" carved around the castle?
- Death.
- That's right.
Well, death is the only thing
returning through that portal.
Fitz was just... an offering
to show him the door.
The original machinery
used to open the portal
was hydroelectric,
but the nearest river is
almost a half a mile away,
which got me wondering
how they powered it.
- May: Aqueducts.
- Yep.
So they brought the water along there
and then up through the portal chamber.
Now, that looks like an
overflow drain deep in the woods,
so we should be able to
slip into the compound
- without anyone seeing a thing.
- I'll exit here with Bobbi and Hunter.
Hopefully, we can barricade
ourselves long enough
to open the portal and get Coulson back.
May, you and Daisy
take Lincoln and Joey,
And you come out here,
on the Southeast side.
Let's find our people
and get out.
Why don't we go to an alien world
and summon a hell beast?
Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.
What could possibly go wrong with that?
- How are you supposed to find it?
- Not your concern.
You just whisper its name
three times into a mirror?
Or do you put a saucer of
milk outside the door at night?
- Not milk.
- Ah, yes, you're right.
Simmons said it can smell blood.
That's not disturbing at all.
Who wouldn't want to be on that team?
Uh...
I think that's the
ridge we're looking for.
You know, uh, Simmons also
said it can drive people crazy.
You're doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.
- What's that?
- That's an interesting question.
- I thought I might check.
- Get away from there!
- Hello?!
- Circle it around to make sure...
Will?!
Hey. Hey, Will.
- You're Fitz.
- Yeah.
Shh.
- I warned you ...
- Wait, wait!
Who the hell is this?
This is Will, okay?
He's gonna be our guide.
Good morning.
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Nope. I'm still right here.
- I don't remember ...
- We overslept, which is nice.
But now you need to get up.
How about we stay here
for a while instead?
Mm.
But it's time.
They need you, Phil ...
more than ever.
- Just one more minute.
- No. Now.
Get up!
Ah.
I'll be damned.
Tatooine.
Ward, listen to me!
You can't kill him!
It's your fault, Fitz!
You didn't follow my instructions!
But I did! I did!
That's why we're here!
We're all dead without him.
You told me to identify the
exit point, which I can do,
but only that man there,
the one you want to kill,
can get us there in time!
Hmm.
So, how long you been here?
Feels like forever.
So you're how Simmons managed
to survive all those
cold nights, huh? Hmm.
- Maybe you want to pull the trigger.
- Grow up, Ward.
Can you walk on that leg?
- What happened?
- I got attacked after Jemma left.
You saved her.
She made it out, and now
I'm here to take you back.
- I can leave? Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we're all gonna leave.
You said you were attacked.
- By what?
- It.
So you know how to find "it"?
- Why would you want to do that?
- I brought it a gift.
We should go.
Bobbi and Hunter are with me.
May, you take the power rangers.
Go find Fitz or Simmons.
Check it.
Okay, we definitely want to
avoid the guy with the suit.
- He's telekinetic.
- Is that the one where
he can read your mind
or move stuff with his mind?
- Move stuff.
- Good.
I don't want anyone knowing
what I'm thinking right now.
You mean that you're not a hero?
That you're freaking out and
want to be anywhere but here?
- We're all feeling that.
- I'm not.
Okay. All of us but May.
You're doing great, okay?
Just breathe, stick close,
and follow our lead.
Be a hell of a lot easier if it
wasn't lit up like a county fair.
On it.
Check the generator.
Can you give us an update
what's up with generators?
- Can you run?
- I don't know. Why?
Ward works for the same
group that sent you here.
They've been sending
people over for centuries.
- Sacrifices.
- Their real agenda
is to find the creature
and bring it back.
Ward found a way to bring it back?
No. I did.
To get Simmons back.
Ward's just a Hydra
toady who hijacked it.
- Hydra. That's an old name.
- Yeah, they're still at it.
Cut off one head, and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
I didn't know I was doing something
they'd been working on for ages.
You're bleeding.
Yeah, so are you.
You know, I ran a dozen
scenarios in my head,
wondering what it'd be
like when we finally met.
There's a lot more blood,
and I never considered the smell.
I can see why Jemma loves you.
Good news is, Ward needs us alive.
I'm the only one that can read the data
and get us to the extraction point.
Just have to try and
find a way to lose him
before we get to the exit.
Follow my lead.
What's the holdup?
There's no holdup. We just need
to make it through that canyon.
- You sure?
- That's the only way to make it in time.
All right. Lead on.
Inhumans.
Man: The prisoner's escaped!
This is our containment module.
Andrew: Jemma!
Help me, please.
Let me out.
- Did Coulson sent you?
- No! I ... I ...
I'm a prisoner.
Hydra's looking for me.
- Where are we?
- England.
Hydra's got Fitz. They've
reopened the portal.
Let me out. I can help.
I've seen your help ...
autopsied the bodies.
Is that why you handed me over to Hydra?
We didn't know they controlled the ATCU.
- May and Coulson were trying to save you.
- Save?
Maybe you didn't hear,
but Melinda shot me.
Well, can't say I blame her
after how you've misbehaved.
Jemma, we may disagree
about the Inhumans,
but we both hate Hydra.
Open this door, and I'll protect you.
I would never, ever hurt you.
But Hydra will kill you.
Maybe you wouldn't,
but what about that thing
you've be...
You got to let me out, Jemma.
I'm the only one who can protect you.
Circle behind.
It's okay. It's all right.
Just don't shoot.
Just don't shoot.
- Oh, god!
- Aah!
Hang in there, Fitz.
Looked like a giant statue.
Ancient.
- Looked like a shrine.
- It used to live there.
Yeah, but who built it?
Were there people here?
Like a civilization?
All I've ever seen here is death.
Well, pretty impressive you've
survived all these years.
Couldn't have been easy.
- I learned to adapt.
- Change or die.
That's worked for me, as well.
The Earth's going through
a big change right now ...
some kind of alien contagion.
Call themselves Inhumans.
I'm not thrilled about it, but
the wind's blowing that way, so...
It's gonna be a bad one!
I'm used to it.
Simmons told me about an
area called the no-fly zone.
You're leading us there, aren't you?
We're already in it.
Stay close.
Bobbi: We're in.
- Hunter: Where are we?
- Mack: Pretty sure that's us.
Brilliant...
Just confirming it's really us.
It is.
You're welcome.
If we're here and we want to go there,
we need to get past about
a dozen Hydra soldiers,
and we need to do it
as covertly as possible.
Copy that.
Are we supposed to wait here or help ...
We need to stay hunkered down, sir!
We don't have time for this!
Hey!
- I think we took a wrong turn!
- This is our loca...
You said they were gonna kill us.
You have a better idea?
What are they doing?
Okay. Let's see what we've got.
Daisy, watch out!
Unh!
No, Lincoln, don't! There's
no way they didn't hear that.
- Come on. We've got to go.
- Did you see that?!
I'm bulletproof! Ha!
Investigating gunfire now.
Stop!
Unh!
Agent May!
- Fitz....
- Ward took him through the portal.
Come on. We're gonna get him back.
- Andrew's here.
- You saw him?
- He saved my life.
- Andrew or Lash?
Technically, I think it was both.
- We could find him, maybe ...
- No. That's not the mission.
Daisy, I've got Simmons.
Heading your way now.
We got to go!
Fan out! Find them!
Aah!
No.
You'll never find Fitz without me.
- I'm not here for Fitz.
- Maybe.
But you're not gonna
let him die here, either.
Fitz is a smart guy.
He'll find his way back.
He'll be dead within the hour.
The creature who lives
here can smell blood.
Fitz is bleeding.
So are you.
Now get up.
You're gonna lead the way.
The party's this way.
Watch your step.
Left a few breadcrumbs
to find our way home.
Simmons.
Hydra knows we grabbed her.
How secure are we in here?
Rough estimate? Not very.
We've sealed and barricaded
the doors, but Hydra
has plenty of big-boy
toys to smash their way in.
I might be able to reinforce the doors.
You know, using my, uh ...
- my, uh ...
- Amazing new superpower.
- Yeah. That.
- Let's give that a go, then.
Mack's through there.
There she is.
That's what I'm talking about.
Now, do you have any idea
how the hell these rocks work?
Is that counting down to a
good thing or a bad thing?
It's the time remaining
until the portal reopens.
And answering your question,
I don't believe we have to
do anything to these rocks.
They're configured so they'll
activate at the designated time.
So that's a good thing.
That depends on whether Fitz
can locate the extraction point
- and who or what is with him.
- He'll make it. Coulson's there.
I know, but it's more
complicated than that.
- Ward's mission is to ...
- Where's May?
Oh, no.
Dr. Garner is here on the premises.
I spoke with him.
- He's actually the one who saved me.
- He's free?
- May must have gone back for him.
- To do what?
I'd say that depends on
what she finds.
Oh, god.
When I say "terrible,"
I mean ancient and powerful.
It's changed how I see things.
I've never believed
I was worth anything...
that what I said or did had any meaning.
Maybe that's why I'm a spy.
Or why I agreed to come here.
If you're trying to talk me out of this,
you can save your breath.
I'm not looking for mercy or absolution.
I just want you to know,
I've been where you are right now.
Filled with rage, wanting revenge...
I chose Hydra for petty,
personal, selfish reasons ...
for a father figure, for vengeance...
for closure.
But what I saw today
gave my life meaning.
For the first time ever,
I have a sense of satisfaction
that I never experienced
when I was seeking revenge.
Got to say,
feels pretty satisfying to me.
Now turn around and keep walking.
You know, everyone had this place wrong.
It isn't death.
It's a new beginning.
Malick was right.
This is all meant to be.
And the fact that you followed me here,
that we're in this together,
that just confirms the fact
that I am part of a grand plan.
I see that now.
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.
You will.
Malick sent Ward to bring
back some ancient Hydra god?
Well, he didn't use those exact words,
but that's the general idea, yes.
It's why he had the
ATCU collect Inhumans,
why he shipped them
here to the castle ...
as some kind of army
for this powerful alien.
Look, we all want Fitz and Coulson back.
What if that thing comes back, too?
Your mother was terrified
of the Monolith for a reason.
You think the Hydra thing
is what she was afraid of?
Bobbi: When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,
Fury sent us onto the Iliad
to keep Hydra from getting
their hands on that Monolith.
What if he knew that
they wanted to bring
- this creature back through it?
- Oh, come on.
What, an ancient alien god?
Are you people hearing the
words coming out of your mouths?
- The world's changing. Deal with it.
- You were there.
- Did you see it? What's it like?
- I did see it.
But I can't really describe
what it looked like.
It's more how it felt,
which is old and pained,
as if it once had
great power but lost it.
And the entire planet is a wasteland.
I can't really say, not
in any scientific terms,
but my sense and certainly
Will's heartfelt belief
was that the creature is
the one responsible ...
that it caused the desolation.
- We have to destroy all this.
- You mean once Fitz and Coulson
find Will and come back through.
I mean, what if they're not
the ones who come back through?
We can't risk that!
Whatever we decide to do
isn't the end of the mission.
There are a dozen
Inhumans in this compound
- that we can't leave behind.
- May: Yes, you can.
They're dead.
Lash or Andrew ...
honestly, I'm not sure
there's a difference anymore...
he killed them all.
Sir, S.H.I.E.L.D. has
infiltrated the castle,
barricaded themselves
inside the portal chamber.
You have less than 15 minutes
to breach their barricades
and regain control of that chamber.
- Sir, I really ...
- That's an order, soldier.
Hold up.
How long before that portal opens?
There's a timer on my watch.
Come on.
We need to move faster.
I could move faster
if you hadn't shot me... twice.
What's that?
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and guess Hydra.
We reinforced the barricades,
but it won't take them
long to break through.
No way they're taking us again.
We can't destroy it before
Fitz and Coulson return,
not when we're this close.
What if the creature
comes through instead?
- We'll be waiting for them with these.
- And what if we can't kill it?
Can't speak for everyone,
but I'll probably run.
Get everyone through the tunnel
and back up to Zephyr One.
I'm going to stay here until
the last possible second
for Coulson, Fitz, and Will.
Now, if Hydra or that alien
thing gets inside here,
you light this castle and compound up
- with every missile on that plane.
- Daisy: What? No, I'm not...
Or Bobbi and I can cover
a couple of the barricaded entrances,
buy us enough time
for the portal to open.
Yeah, I'm down with that plan.
if Hydra tries to get through
the barricades, I can ...
What part of "that's an order"
do you not understand?!
Coulson put me in charge
to make the hard call,
and that's what I'm doing.
We can't afford to lose our
best agents in one fell swoop ...
not here, not tonight!
Now, if I don't get out...
May's the new director.
- That's what Coulson would want.
- Okay.
But one thing ...
I'm staying with you,
because, "a," I can keep the portal
open if something goes wrong,
and, "b," I'm your partner.
Technically, that's two things.
Daisy stays.
Everyone else, get the hell out of here!
- Is your leg gonna be okay?
- I don't really feel it.
The portal's just over this rise.
It's gonna be close, but I
think we're gonna make it.
Jemma's gonna be
really happy to see you.
This must be very difficult for you.
Getting you off this godforsaken
planet is all that matters...
Jemma never told me there was
an ancient civilization here.
She never saw it.
We're still in the no-fly zone.
What else do you know
about the ancient city?
What happened to it ...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey. Hang on, hang on.
Let me fix that.
There used to be nine
cities on this planet.
The beings who lived
there were fairly advanced.
But they feared change.
They were easily divided.
They warred among themselves,
destroyed their entire race.
You seem to know a lot about them.
They had a chance to become something
great, something beautiful, but...
in the end...
How do you know so much about ...
Because I was there.
- You're not Will.
- No.
Will died saving Jemma...
from me.
Unh!
May: Listen up.
All weapons systems online,
- then take her up to 20,000 feet.
-  Yes, ma'am.
Bobbi.
Looks like Hydra's inside the castle.
They're gonna make it, right?
- Tell me that was you.
- That's just them getting closer.
Okay, tremors, let's hope this works.
Forgot about this part.
Get out of here. I
can handle everything.
I'm not leaving. I'll be fine.
Did you see that?
One minute left.
We don't have much time.
In case you-know-what shows
up instead of our peeps.
Anything other than
our people comes out,
we give May the high sign
and blow it to hell.
Same if Hydra gets in here.
It's open. There's the portal.
- That's good.
- But that's not. Hydra's almost in.
All weapons systems ... go hot.
Stand by for my command.
- How many people?
- Unh!
The lives you've taken.
We're out of time.
Coulson!
The portal's closing!
He's finished! Leave him!
Let's go!
Now!
Now! We have to go!
Mack: Open the doors!
I'm bringing them in!
Man: Sir, your plane is
waiting at the airport.
We'll have you there
in less than 30 minutes.
Well, I'll be damned.
