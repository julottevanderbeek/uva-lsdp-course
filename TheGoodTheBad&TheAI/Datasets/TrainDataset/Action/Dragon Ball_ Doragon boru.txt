Long ago, in an era
completely unknown to all...
On a certain mountain thousands
of miles from civilization,
there lived a lone boy who
communed with nature.
"Bulma and Son Goku"
Hiya!
Okay! All done making the firewood!
I sure am hungry...
It should be right around here somewhere...
Grandpa! I'm going out to catch food!
That's weird, I could swear
l saw you glowing...
Grandpa! Did you do something just now?
Weird!
Oh well.
What do I feel like eating?
I already had a bear the other day...
Yahoo!
Yummy!
This feels great!
That's it! I'll have some fish!
Time to eat!
I did it!
What a good haul!
What's that sound?
I hit him!
He's alive!
You evil beast! You're trying
to steal my food, aren't you?!
Well, I won't let you!
If you want my food, then come fight me!
How dare you, you monster!
Huh? There's a weird goblin
coming out of the beast!
You jerk!
What was that? Black magic?!
Yikes! Why aren't you dead?!
Don't be stupid! l'd never die that easy!
My body's as hard as steel!
Say goodbye, you evil goblin!
Goblin?!
Time out! I'm not a goblin! I'm a human!
Human...?
lsn't it obvious? Have a good look! See?
Stop right there!
Don't move a muscle!
Are you human?!
Of course I am!
You don't seem like me,
you're soft and weak-looking...
Well, come on, I'm a girl!
A girl? You're a girl?
What a hick!
You've never seen a girl before?
No. You're the first human l've
seen besides me and Grandpa.
Grandpa told me that if I ever met l
girl, that I should be nice to her.
Sounds like good advice.
So you live together with your grandpa then?
He died a long time ago.
What're you doing, you little pervert?!
Girls don't even have tails?
How strange!
Talk about lame!
Does he think he's cool
with that tail accessory?
Did this beast catch you or something?
This isn't a beast! It's a car!
I heard about cars from Grandpa,
but this is what they look like?
You're really strong for someone so tiny.
Grandpa trained me!
Oh! If you were riding in this,
does that mean you're from the city?
Yeah.
Okay! Come to my house!
I'll make you some food
since you're a girl!
W-wait a second.
It's further down this path,
so does that mean he has it... ?
If so, then his power'll come in
really handy, even if he is weird... !
What's wrong? Don't you want
me to make you any food?
I'm coming.
But no funny business!
What's funny business?
Well, you know...
That's right!
This is the first time he's seen a girl,
so he doesn't know anything about that!
You sure are weird.
Oh well! Follow me!
By the way, what's your name?
Goku! Son Goku!
What about you?
Eh? Me?
Yeah!
Bulma.
Bulma?
What a funny name!
That's why I didn't wanna tell you!
Bulma!
Look, I don't like it either, you know!
I hate kids!
Wait here.
Grandpa... !
What's the matter?
G-Grandpa's talking!
I thought your grandpa was dead...
There it is! The Dragon Ball!
Move!
Hey! Stop touching Grandpa!
Grandpa...? This?
Yeah! It's the only memento
of his that he left me!
Girls aren't allowed to touch it!
Look! He's glowing! It's
like he's talking excitedly!
That's the first time
l've seen him do that!
Oh well, I guess I'll let
you in on the secret.
Look!
It's Grandpa! You have two grandpas?!
These aren't grandpas,
they're Dragon Balls!
Dragon Balls...?
Yeah! Your Dragon Ball is
reacting to these two here.
Try putting yours next to them.
Okay...
See?
I found this ball in a
storeroom in my house.
I wondered what it was,
so I did some research
and found out they're
actually really amazing!
What's so amazing about them?
Want me to tell you?
Yeah.
Alright.
There it is!
So this is the legendary Dragon Ball?
So I just chant the words into this, right?
--No.
--Eh?
While that is a Dragon Ball, it's
completely useless by itself.
What?!
Pilaf-sama. There are seven
Dragon Balls in all...
Seven, huh...?
When all seven Dragon Balls
are brought together,
Shen Long - the lord of
the dragons - appears.
If you chant the words then,
then he will grant you any
single wish you want.
Any wish at all? lncredible!
I will use the Dragon Balls
to rule the world!
Wow!
Any wish will come true if you
collect all seven Dragon Balls?
I heard that someone once collected
them all and became a king!
But that was a really long time ago,
so it looks like they all got
separated again since then.
So you're trying to collect them all?
It was really hard, but ten days ago
l finally found this Five-Star Ball
in a valley to the north!
Grandpa's has four stars!
Which makes it the Four-Star Ball!
I already know what my wish is going to be!
Having an unlimited supply of
strawberries is hard to turn down,
but I'm going to wish for
a cute boyfriend instead!
So can I have that Four-Star Ball?
No way!
Grandpa gave this to me!
Cheapskate!
Come on, you're not going to use it anyway!
Oh, I get it! I know what you want!
How about this?
You can touch it if you'd like!
I don't wanna touch your dirty butt.
It is not dirty! How rude!
Yeah, why don't you help
me find the Dragon Balls?
Your grandpa did tell you
to be nice to girls, right?
Find the Dragon Balls?
You've got nothing to do here, after all.
And it's your duty as a man to go to
various places and train yourself!
Do you think I can get strong
like Grandpa if I train?
Of course!
All you've ever seen are
these mountains, right?
You haven't even seen the ocean, have you?
There're towns where tons of people live,
and you'll even get to see
dinosaurs and monsters!
Sounds like fun! I think I'll go!
Great! It's decided then!
But you're not getting my ball!
I'll hold on to it.
That's fine! I'll just need to borrow
it after we find the other ones...
This is looking good!
He'll make the perfect bodyguard,
and it doesn't matter as
long as I get my wish!
Time to set out on our
exciting adventure! Let's go!
But how do you find the other balls
if you don't know where they are?
That's what makes me so smart!
Though I'm cute too!
This!
The Dragon Radar. I made it myself!
Look! These three dots
are the balls we have.
The next one is over here.
Approximately 1200 kilometers to the west!
I don't get it.
We can't just walk there, though.
You totaled my car, so we'll
have to use something else...
Let's see... What number was it?
Number nine!
Get back.
Okay, let's go!
Yikes! You're a witch!
I knew it! You really are a witch!
What are you talking about?
These're called Hoi Poi Capsules;
everyone civilized uses them!
It's not black magic!
Just get in behind me already!
Ready? Here we go!
Wow! This goes a lot faster than I run!
Hey, watch where you're grabbing!
And so began Goku and Bulma's
fantastic and momentous adventure!
Wow! What an amazing technique!
We were flying!
I try my best... !
I didn't expect the slope to be that steep!
Sorry! Wait there, I'll be right back!
Why? Where are you going?
You sure are dimwitted, huh?!
When a lady says that, she's
obviously going to take a leak!
Oh, you need to go pee?
No following me!
But she could've gone pee right here...
She sure is weird.
What's wrong? Did a snake bite your wiener?!
Who are you?!
I'm Goku. Are you a friend of hers?
Why, yes.
We have some things to
discuss now, so you wait here!
Huh? I'm all tied up.
Well, thanks a bunch! Bye now!
It's been so long since l've had human meat!
I'm gonna take my time eating you!
Hey! How long should I wait?!
What're you doing?! Save me!
ldiot! Moron! Blockhead!
Oh, you want me to save you?
You should've said so sooner!
But now what do I do? I can't fly...
That's right!
I wonder if I can ride this...
I think she twisted this thing hard...
I did it! It's moving!
Okay!
Here goes!
I'll do it from here!
Goku!
What a fool!
Extend, pole!
Have a taste of my Nyoibou!
Help me... !
Okay!
I guess I didn't save her after all...
I wound up taking a leak anyway... !
Good for you!
Goku and Bulma's journey has just begun.
What awaits them next on their adventure?
