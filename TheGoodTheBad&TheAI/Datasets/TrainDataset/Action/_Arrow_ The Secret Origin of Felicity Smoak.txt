My name is Oliver Queen.
After five years in hell,
I have come home
with only one goal--
to save my city.
Now others have
joined my crusade.
To them, I am Oliver Queen.
To the rest
of Starling City,
I am someone else.
I am something else.
Previously, on "Arrow"...
There's a lot of good people,
they lose someone,
they lose themselves,
which is why they come in here
to work off that rage.
Roy, are you ok?
You look a little tired.
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.
If I had accepted my life,
I would be a cocktail waitress
in Vegas
like my mother,
and I never would have believed some
crazy guy in a hood
when he told me I could be
more than just some it girl.
You're not moving
very quickly this morning.
I just didn't sleep
much last night.
You're not boxing, girl.
You're not even fighting.
You're just lashing out.
Come on!
Impressive.
How do normal people
spend their morning?
Four...
Five.
Yes!
Mrs. Fernandes!
I already told you,
I haven't seen
your...cat.
I haven't
seen him, either.
Or is the cat a girl?
Was I being misogynist
just now?
Or is it misogynistic?
I never know.
Ray...What are you--
Nice place you've got here.
Lots of space.
So it occurred
to me this morning,
what's the one thing
that Queen Consolidated has
that we don't use
to its maximum potential?
A doorbell?
Have you heard of a process
called cogeneration?
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.
Well, cogeneration is--
The repurposing
of waste heat given
off by electricity production.
Exactly. It's a principle
of thermodynamic efficiency,
which occurred to me
could be applied to a building
which generates over
Like Queen Consolidated.
Mm-hmm.
I did some
preliminary calculations
on the drive over.
You want to sell QC's excess
energy back to the city?
If by "sell" you mean "give away
for free," then yes.
Energy is something
that should be given
freely to the masses.
Uh, you still haven't found
Mrs. Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.
Oh, my
beautiful girl!
Very friendly with
your neighbors, I see.
Mom...
Mom?
What are you doing here?
Honey, I came
to see you.
For a visit.
Look, look, look.
Didn't you
get my text?
Mom, to send a text,
you actually have
to press "send" on the text.
Oh, ok, not a big
deal, I'll do it right now.
Are you adopted?
Hmm.
Oh! I'm so sorry. I didn't know
you had somebody staying over.
Oh, no, he's not
staying over.
He's not, like,
we're not--
this is my boss.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Smoak.
Hi. You can call me Donna.
Mom...
I'm Ray.
Oh, my god. Palmer?
You're that watch guy.
We like to call them
smart wearables.
I bought one
of your watches! Look!
See? Felicity here
thinks I don't
pay attention to all
of her tech-y things.
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS.
I'm actually wearing a prototype
for the new six.
Yeah, it basically
replaces your computer.
Very fancy.
You know what?
It's yours.
Oh, no.
Seriously?
I'll let you two
catch up.
Let me know what you think
about those cogeneration numbers,
and Donna, hope to see
you again soon.
Well, don't count on it.
She'll probably be really busy...
Planning my funeral
after I die of embarrassment.
"You are standing
in an open field
"west of the White House
with a boarded front door."
What are you doing?
I just finished coding
a Linux emulator for Zork.
Ohh. "It is
pitch black.
"You are likely
to be eaten...
by a grue."
I guess you'll have
to protect me.
Why can't you just quietly
have sex under a comforter
like most
college students?
You found
an exploitable note?
Now I just need your super
computer virus to crack the firewall.
I really wish you wouldn't
call my x-axis bi-numeric
algorithm a "super-virus."
Spoofing the IP,
switching to MD6, and...
Somebody take a screenshot.
We have to post this to hackerforum,
to brag that
we actually got in!
Hold on. 30 seconds until
the firewall goes back up.
Cooper, what are you doing?
I think the world would
be a much better place
if there weren't any
student loans, don't you?
You can't wipe out
all the loans,
they'll never think
it's a glitch.
They're going to track
us down and find us!
- 10 seconds.
- Cooper!
I'm not going to jail
for you, Cooper,
and you shouldn't, either.
Coop!
I almost had it!
What were you thinking?!
Ever heard of
hacktivisim?
Instead of posting
to web forums,
we could be doing
some real good in the world.
And going to prison
in the process.
It's all about what you want
to be when you grow up, babe--
A hacker,
or a hero?
Hello?
Speedy?
Just signed the lease.
What do you think?
Thea, you're signing
a lease on a spot
that you can't
possibly afford.
I can, actually.
Whose money?
Malcolm Merlyn's.
His estate, I mean.
When I left Starling City,
I mentioned something
to Ned Foster about Malcolm
being my father,
and there's a lot of legal stuff
I didn't understand, and--
He left you money?
The entire world
thinks he's dead.
So, yes, legally,
his estate goes
to his last living heir.
And, ahem, last week
when you told me
that you had
investors for the club,
that was a lie?
I was afraid
you wouldn't react well
to the idea of me
taking his money.
It's blood money,
Thea!
You don't know
what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of!
I know what his money
is capable of--
renting me
this really sweet loft.
Listen to me.
He's alive,
and if you take
his money, he has a hold on you.
I think you're being
a little melodramatic.
I'm his daughter, ok?
He's not going to put me in danger.
He's responsible for the death of
including your brother.
Now that is a card
that you do not get to play.
You are my brother,
but that does not mean
you have the right to tell me
what I can do with my life.
I am my own person.
The movers are coming tomorrow,
so you can stop by with popcorn
or not stop by at all.
Oh, please.
What is going on?
Ollie?
You ok?
Disguised voice:
We are Brother Eye.
Judgment has been rendered
against this city.
Its sentence carried out.
An earthquake. A siege.
This is what comes next--
a new life you will
live on your knees,
and it will take nothing more than
a push of a button.
We are in control now.
And this is just
the beginning.
Let there be light.
Original Air Date on November 5, 2014
== sync, corrected by  ==
Ooh, a nightclub.
You know, I'm really
not dressed for a nightclub.
Really?
You think?
My friend owns the
place. He just needs
a little help turning
the power back on, so...
Oh.
Why don't you...
Come, come.
Stay put.
Stay here?
Right here.
Ok.
Mm-hmm.
Hey. Any luck
tracking this--
Hello.
Hi. Uh,
please tell me
this is your friend.
No. Mom,
this is Oliver...
Queen.
Very nice to meet you.
Yes, it's so nice
to meet you, too.
How many billionaires
do you know?
Diggle, meet Felicity's mom.
Mom. John Diggle.
- Hi.
- Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you,
too. Oh! Hello!
Who is this
little nugget?
This is my daughter Sara.
- Ooh!
- Mom.
Mom. Ahem, mom!
What?
We have to go
downstairs.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to stop you.
I'm so sorry.
Little baby moment.
So sorry.
It's great
to meet you, finally.
Yes, yes, definitely.
Why is Sara here?
Lyla's on on assignment
in Santa Prisca
and the nanny
called in sick.
But--we can't
bring her down there.
Why not, Oliver,
who's she going to tell?
Well, she--
I'm not comfortable
with her down there.
God help me.
My mother loves
babies. Just...
Really?
Whoever this Brother Eye group is
somehow got access
to the city's
protected network
and uploaded
a system-wide virus.
Oliver: Any way to trace it?
No, it deleted itself
as soon as it completed its task.
They said the power outage
was just the beginning.
Then let's find
them before there's a next time.
Hey, Laurel,  are you all right?
Did you get here ok?
I'm fine.
I was close.
But why do I get
the emergency services alert?
Why don't they call
the district attorney?
'Cause he's visiting
his niece in Coast City.
You are the acting
district attorney.
Congratulations.
- Hello, Detective--
- Captain.
Look, you're on this
Brother Eye thing, right?
We are.
Good,
'cause there's no one
here knows computers
better than you.
No, for the last time,
I am not interested
in buying a fake ID.
I am hanging up now. Bye.
My mom says hi.
You still angry at me?
I was past
the firewall
and into the account network.
I had 3,000 debts wiped
by the time you pulled
the plug on me.
Well, think of how many
accounts you could
go to prison for
if I hadn't stopped you.
Relax.
The DNS wasn't
configured.
They can't
backtrace me.
They can. The subroot
was configured.
By accessing the accounts,
you set off a packets feedback
that anyone could
trace back to.
You are gorgeous when
you're being a chicken.
- Come on, I'm serious.
- I'm serious.
Cooper Seldoel
FBI!
Don't move
You are under arrest.
What?! No!
No, no, no!
You're under arrest for violation
of U.S. Code title 18,
section 1030.
Don't!
You have the right
to remain silent.
Let go of him,
let him go!
Brother Eye: We said this was
just the beginning.
Electricity is not
the only power in the city.
Consider money,
for example.
The banks are next to go dark.
Your beloved dollars wiped away
as your accounts will finally all be equal,
at zero.
Felicity...
I'm working on it.
I set up some trace IP packets
before Brother Eye's
last broadcast.
As soon as he opened up the channel,
I scooped  up the bread crumbs.
- Bread crumbs we can follow?
- I hope so.
Where's
Captain Lance?
Coordinating squad car
patrols for dispatch.
Why? What's wrong?
There's a situation
at Starling National.
Send in an ESU squad.
Sorry, ma'am,
but you don't have the power to--
I'm acting district attorney.
The city charter gives me
operational authority
in times of crisis,
which this clearly is.
I'm not letting
anyone get hurt.
Send in an ESU now.
What's going on?
SCPD just dispatched
a riot squad
to Starling
National.
It's like fighting a fire
with gasoline.
Suit up.
This group is ordered
to disperse!
Back!
Back behind the line!
Felicity: Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control.
You need to hurry up.
Back! Back
behind the line!
Get away
from the bank!
The teargas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm
the entire city,
Felicity.
The trace led me
to the virus they're using.
It is a mile past complex.
I'm combing through now.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
What's wrong?
The virus...
I can't stop it!
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.
I wrote it five years ago.
Ok, ok, before
you say anything,
just know that I never imagined
the virus being used
for something like this.
I mean, sure,
I could have
imagined it.
I actually have
a very vivid imagination.
Like cronuts!
I had a vision of them before--
Hey.
Relax.
Take a deep breath.
Good.
Now start at the beginning.
I was in this,
I guess you could
call it a group,
in college.
We were "hacktivists."
For lack
of a better word.
Civil disobedience
via the World Wide Web.
I created this.
This...
Super virus.
That could give us
root access
to any infected server.
We could expose
government fraud
and start
virtual sit-ins
and digitally
deface criminals.
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.
Felicity.
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?
Do we even know
a fraction
of what happened to you the five years
that you were away?
Who else had access
to the program?
Myron Forest.
He was my...
I had a boyfriend
in college,
and Myron
was his roommate.
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?
What about the boyfriend?
Oh, he couldn't
have done this.
He's...not
in the picture,
but Myron always had
somewhat of an edge.
Can you get me an address?
Sure.
Just one small problem--
not small,
necessarily, but short.
Just take
the alleyway entrance.
Ok.
Are you ok?
I've been better.
I talked it over with Myron,
and I'm going to tell them
I wrote the super virus.
You can't do that.
I can't let you
rot in prison, Coop.
You can't tell them
you wrote that virus...
'Cause I already
told them I did.
Cooper...
I always said I'd protect you
from the grues.
- This isn't--
- It's better this way.
I wiped out
those loans.
There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.
I love you.
Love you, too.
Hey. Got a minute?
Congratulations,
you called in a riot squad,
you nearly started one!
And! You did it behind my back.
You were busy,
and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.
You escalated it, Laurel!
Please tell me you can
at least see that now.
Ok.
I'm sorry.
Laurel, baby...
What's gotten into you?
You're angry, you're distant,
you're reckless.
Tell me you're not
boozing again.
No.
Then what the hell's going on?
Because this isn't you.
Look, I haven't said anything
because I was hoping
that you would say something,
because you, sweetheart,
you are in ten different kinds of pain,
and you won't talk about it.
I can't talk
about it with you.
Ok.
But listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.
But talk about it
with somebody.
'Cause secrets hurt, baby.
Sometimes more than the truth.
Ahh.
Back-up generator
keeps that locked.
Or...so they told me.
I could never get that
stupid door to open.
Contractor says the entire
sub level is flooded, though.
It was a water main break.
What are you
doing here, Ollie?
A super hacker is trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.
I still get to be worried,
right?
Yes.
And if you
really have to,
you can even be
judgmental--
occasionally.
Someone told me
recently
that a family is
pretty precious.
And love,
in spite of everything,
is what makes it
precious.
Right now, the Queen family
is just you and me.
So let it just be you and me.
And don't take Merlyn's money.
I'm trying to meet you
halfway here, Ollie.
The other half
is up to you.
Myron Forest.
You have failed this city.
Tell him he has to retract
all the infected packets
from subsystem mainframes
within the city.
Tell me how
to shut down the virus.
Do it now.
You think I'm behind
the cyber attacks?
Sounds like
a Brother Eye to me.
I swear to god, I'm not.
I head up the IT department
of an accounting firm.
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.
I'm one of the sheep lunatics
like these guys hate.
Why would I do this?
Digital fingerprints
are all over this code.
There's an x-axis
bionumeric algorithm.
The code's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm
that you've used before!
In college.
My roommate
and his girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we developed it.
We called it a super virus, but
that doesn't mean I'm the eye guy!
Have you tried
Felicity Smoak?
She's innocent.
Then it's got to be
someone else.
After we graduated,
I might have showed
the code off
to a few people.
- Who were they?!
- I don't remember.
It was five years ago.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
We were just kids
playing with matches.
I am running out
of expletives!
We need
to track down
whoever Myron shared
your code with.
I hacked all of his emails
and all his text messages
from five years ago
and all I got was depressed.
Ok. What
about your ex?
I already told you,
he didn't do it.
Why? Because he's
your ex-boyfriend?
Because...
My senior year of college,
Cooper and I did
a stupid thing.
He got arrested
and he went to prison.
So he went to prison.
Maybe he got out.
He didn't.
How do you know?
Because he's dead.
He hung himself
before sentencing.
Felicity, I...
I just really need to be
alone right now.
Ah. I'm glad
you're here.
When I launched
my plan to rebrand
Starling
into Star City,
I didn't count on
cyber terrorism.
I'm looking
for a partner
with whom
to drown my sorrows
and you definitely
look like someone
who could use a drink.
I'm sorry.
My mother...
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.
You ok?
You're an inventor.
Did you ever create
anything that you didn't
think was important,
turns out,
it's very important?
Of course.
Those turn out to be
the best inventions.
Not always.
You want to talk about it?
Of course
I'd find you here.
Could you just wait one second?
Wait?
I'm sorry;
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment,
and before that,
it was two hours in the club.
Is there any way that you could be
anywhere else but here?
Thanks, Mom.
That wasn't
the least bit mortifying.
Only half as bad as parents'
week in freshman year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking
my own daughter.
Because you can't
seem to comprehend
that I can't make
the whole world stop
because you decided to
show up on my doorstep.
I have responsibilities!
Yes, I know, Felicity.
You have work.
You have work, work, work, work.
No, no, no,
you don't understand.
It is so much more
than work.
But all you care about
it my love life
or how much cleavage
I don't show.
That is not true!
That is completely true!
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.
I'm sorry I have
an actual job.
I'm sorry that I don't
dress like a porn star!
Which I realize is
a compliment to you.
So I'm so sorry
that I am such
a disappointment to you!
I'm not as smart
as you, Felicity,
or your father.
I know that.
Even when you were only six years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.
And...
Maybe I wasn't always
the mother you wanted,
but I was always there.
I stayed and I tried.
He...
He left me.
He left us.
But when I look at you,
all I see
is what he gave you.
There is nothing of me...
In you.
You know,
it's so funny. I was--
I was always so afraid
that one day,
you were going to leave me,
too.
But now I finally realize...
You already did.
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right?
People we can hit?
We need Felicity.
I'm here.
The super virus
has 3,407 traceable access notes.
Hopefully I didn't
put a firewall in every one, though.
Of course I did, because
I'm smarter than that.
Seriously, if I had
two less IQ points,
we never would have
gotten in this mess.
Are you all right?
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.
Probably back
at my place,
wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.
So go see her.
Take an hour.
The city
is under attack.
You're our best chance
of stopping it,
but not like this, Felicity.
Your head's not in the game.
I will get it
together.
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour.
Go talk to your mom.
I do not have anything
to say to her.
You know, earlier today,
Thea told me
that she literally
has to put up with me
because family is precious.
And that it's love,
in spite of everything,
that makes it precious.
Go.
Where's Sara?
The nanny came
to pick her up.
Said he was from a company
called A.R.G.U.S.
I don't know,
I've never heard of it.
I think
that's the point.
Well, I'm glad
you're still here.
You are a terrible liar,
Felicity.
Might be the only thing
we have in common.
I have blonde hair.
You dye it.
You're right.
We're different,
and it's always going to be that way.
And it's not easy--
No, you know
what, it's--
it's totally my fault
for just showing up here uninvited.
Seriously. I think
I just got so excited
about this free flight.
What?
My plane ticket.
I got an email that said
I'd won some contest.
Free first class
round trip to Starling.
Email?
Mom.
Someone wanted you
to be here.
Mom!
- Baby!
- Mom!
Are you ok?
I'm ok.
Oh!
Oh, thank god!
Where are we?
Felicity Smoak, just the woman
I wanted to see.
What the hell
do you want from me?!
Who are you?
You really don't know?
I thought you'd never
forget your first love.
You died.
They told me--
That I committed
suicide, right?
The NSA needed a hacker with game
for cyber espionage,
and I needed
to not be in prison
for the rest of my life.
Because of what the NSA
wanted me doing,
it was...advantageous
for me to be dead.
When I found out you died,
I was devastated.
I loved you.
I loved you, too.
After I finished my time
with the NSA,
I was going to find you.
To let you in on this.
And then I discovered
you'd become this
corporate lap dog.
Broke my heart.
You changed.
If you ever thought I was capable
of doing something like this,
you never really
knew me at all.
When you wrote this
virus, Felicity,
you knew exactly
what it was capable of.
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential
of what you made.
Why?!
This isn't who you are!
Five years with the NSA,
you learn a lot about
how the world works.
How we can't be saved
or salvaged.
How it's every man
for himself.
You also learn that when
a city bank goes under,
say, financial
cyber attack,
the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department
and request an influx
of fresh cash.
Cash which is transported
by armored trucks
navigating according to
a closed-end GPS system,
which directs them
to City Deposit.
If the drivers
deviate from the route,
the trucks are shut down.
But you're going to hack
into the system
and direct the cash
to come here.
It was about money,
and I'm the sell-out?
No.
No, babe.
You're the one who's
going to help me.
See, breaking into
the treasury's
asymmetric
encryption
is beyond even
my capabilities.
I'm going to politely decline.
- Don't!
- That's why I flew
some motivation
into town for you.
She's been MIA
for over an hour.
Well, you did tell her to go home.
I just had an A.R.G.U.S. agent
pick up Sara there.
I could have them go back,
check things out.
Yep.
Ok.
Felicity's
never more
than five feet
from her phone.
Something's wrong.
No! No!
That terminal's configured
to only connect
with the Treasury's IP.
I mention this
so you don't try
to do anything stupid,
like alert the police.
I'm so sorry.
Mom...right now's
not really
the best time, ok?
But it might be
the last time, hon,
and I want you to know
that all I've ever wanted...
is for you to be happy.
Let's say we hit pause
on the Dr. Phil episode.
It's done!
It's done.
That quick?
There's a reason
you wanted me, right?
They'll be at your front
door in five minutes.
Guards will be armed.
Stay put, ok?
Just because
we used to screw
doesn't mean
I won't use this gun.
What's that?
Huh? Oh, that,
that's the watch.
It's the watch
Mr. Palmer gave me.
It chimes on the hour, and I guess
when we're about to be killed.
We're not going
to be killed.
We're going to get
out of here.
It basically replaces
your computer.
You know I don't know
what that means.
It means it has Wifi.
Really?
Ok.
When they're in range...
You know what to do.
I did what you wanted.
You don't have
to kill us.
Really?
Who would have thought
that I'd become the grue?
Hey!
Hey.
You want to wave
that gun at me, fine,
but don't you dare
threaten my daughter.
Here I thought you were
all nails and hair.
Try single mom who's worked
in order to raise that
genius child you see right there.
I may not understand
all this cyber whatever,
but I know without that gun,
you wouldn't last 10 seconds
against my girl.
Too bad she doesn't have
Oliver: I disagree!
Put the gun down.
You were always good,
Felicity.
So good.
But so am I.
Cooper: Motion sensored.
They can hit
most any target.
Something's wrong.
Clear.
This is all your fault.
Mom! Mom, are you ok?
Are you ok?
Before,
you were right to keep
pressing on Cooper.
Turns out he's not
as dead as I thought.
I've had some
experience with that.
And you learn
not to judge.
Yes.
Are you ok?
I guess so.
Old lovers have a way
of opening old wounds.
Lovers...sounds creepy
no matter how you say it.
Felicity...
I want you to know that whatever
experiences you had to go through,
I'm glad that you did.
They shaped the person
you are today.
And you know how
I feel about her.
I should head out.
You were right.
We have to love
our families.
No matter what.
Felicity.
You here?
What happened to you?
This is me now.
You were right.
Something is
going on with me.
And my father, he--
he noticed it as well.
He told me I should
open up to someone.
My sister, she--
she died.
Well, she--
she was murdered.
Did they ever catch the--
No.
No one knows that she's gone
except for me.
And I can't tell
anyone. So, yes.
Yes, I am angry.
I'm going to help
you with that.
See, before, Laurel, you were
swinging at your sister's killer.
That's a target
you're never going to hit.
Don't train for that.
All right,
train for yourself.
See, now I know
how to teach you.
So what's it
going to be?
Red or black?
Black.
Definitely black.
It was popcorn,
right?
You said you were
meeting me halfway.
This is me
doing my part.
I missed you, Speedy.
Let's not miss
each other anymore.
I mean, it was so much easier
to be in each other's lives
when we were
underneath the same roof.
So...Why don't you
move in with me?
I mean, clearly I
have enough space.
And I...
I swear once the club starts
making a profit,
I will donate all
of Malcolm's money
to an earthquake relief
charity thing.
I can live with that.
You got a TV in here?
Well,
I'm officially off.
I mean, my flight doesn't
leave till tonight,
but I figured you'd be
working, so we can--
we can just
say good-bye now.
You were right.
- About what?
- I haven't always
been appreciative
of you.
You were always
there for me every day,
and night.
So if I haven't said
thank you enough,
thank you.
But you were
wrong, too.
Mm-hmm?
When you said all you saw
in me was dad;
there was nothing
of you in me.
Well, I can't
really explain it,
but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.
And I have learned that I am a lot
tougher than I thought.
That...
I get from you.
don't cry.
So I took another look
at those cogeneration numbers.
You want to...
Oh.
Hi again.
Hi.
How's that new smart wearable
working out for you?
Oh, it's, um,
it's a real life saver.
Yeah.
Ray, I can't come
into work today.
I am...
Calling in sick.
"Feel better."
Thank you.
Thank you.
See you later.
That's actually
pretty genius.
Man: Hello, Sara.
What are you
doing here?
