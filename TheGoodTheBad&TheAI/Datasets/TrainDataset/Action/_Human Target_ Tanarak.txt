i'm alone now.
i'm cut off.
nowhere to run.
i had to do this.
i had to try.
i'm afraid it's all going
to end and end quietly.
i'm afraid i'm never going to
get out of the wilderness here.
i'm afraid i've failed.
they're after me.
send help.
after i got this message,i
kept trying to call her back.
then i called the sheriff.
but after her message.
you don't know who to trust.
dr.shaw.
i was worried about
you speeding like that.
something were to happen to
you,why,we'd be up a creek.
sorry.
i've got an emergency
appendectomy on the mainland.
now what's in the back?
since jessie was a child,the more in need
someone was,the more she wanted to help.
first,it was that e.r.in chicago.
then doctors without
borders in east africa.
kabul,kosovo.
mrs.shaw,i've got to be honest with you.
we've never worked in
that part of the world.
now,i don't know what detective simms
told you about the way we operate,but.
he said you were the best,and he said that if it were
his child,you'd be the only people he'd trust to help.
what do we have here?
hank benson.
yeah,i thought i'd take the body to county
while i was there,get the autopsy started.
i don't think the company's
gonna like that very much.
they keep trying to tell me she's lost.
jessica's not lost.
i know my daughter.
she can handle herself.
let's go!
get down there.
i want bodies,both of them.
agrius industries?
$16.2 billion in sales last year.
industrial hardware,agriculture,biotech,and
apparently a small mining operation in tanarak,alaska.
about three hours after jessica's voice
mail,the company made an announcement
that they were going to be doing a heavy blasting
around the mines and restricting access to the island.
so you think they're keeping
people away while they hunt for her?
that's the way i read it.
so why would a big company like that mess
around with a smalltime country doctor?
well,jessica's mother said that the company reps have
been hassling her about the death of a mine foreman.
something about trying
to prevent an autopsy.
autopsy?was he murdered?
you know,that's what's strange.
i looked into it.
the guy actually did
die of a heart attack.
no foul play whatsoever suggested.
that's weird.
okay,the island.
forest surrounding the mine.
one access road to the mainland
here,which they've closed,
so we're gonna have to build you an
official cover to get you through,
which is going to be very difficult since
we don't have any friends like that up there.
he's on it.
what can i say?
he likes your desk.
look,i don't know how he does what
he does and i don't give a damn,
but up there in alaska,it's
completely insulate.
you're not from there,you can't get in.
you don't think he can do it?
no,no.
i really don't.
i'll tell you what.
just stay here,work the corporate angle.
it's a big company,somebody has to
know something and how we can stop it.
paul woodruff.
who is paul woodruff?
alaska bureau of land
and mine development.
guy's been on leave for a couple of months,so
you're him for the next 48 hours.enjoy.
- thank you.
- you're welcome.
i.d.and paperwork will be in the
car waiting for you when you land.
well,i got a plane to catch.
you two let me know what you find.
later,dude.
don't you want to know how i did it?
no.
no?
maybe.
you remember what i
said about that place.
they don't like strangers,so don't go
up there screwing around or nothing.
just blend in and keep a low profile.
it's me.
yeah.
just wait in line ?
you'll be just fine ?
and maybe one day
you'll be where we are ?
can i help you,sir?
oh,thank god you speak english.
i've been driving so long,i figured
i should be halfway to moscow by now.
was that a joke?
ahah yeah,it was.
paul woodruff,bureau of
land and mine management.
i heard you had some heavy blasting going
on down at the mine,shut the island down.
yes,sir,until the wind blows
out the dust and debris.
right,well,unfortunately someone
forgot to tell my office about that,
so would it be possible to get
some of this out of the way for me?
you just wait right there.
yeah,it's me.
yeah,i got a guy down here.
his name's paul woodruff the
bureau of land and mine management.
he wants to drive onto the island.
- he's here now?
- yeah
damn.all right.
- have big mike take him in.
- okay,yeah.
got it.
i'm gonna have to provide you
with an escort onto the island.
great.
who am i following?
you're going to be driven
to the site directly.
we wouldn't want to scratch up
this nice new camaro of yours.

Season 1 Episode 10
we stopping for any particular reason?
unit one,come in.
go ahead.
got eyes on a smoke column about
copy that.
get out there and report back.
oh,you're looking for somebody.
i thought the island was evacuated.
lost touch with a surveyor yesterday.
need me to file a report?
sit in the car,don't go
anywhere,don't touch anything.
i'll be back.
what are you using that for?
bears.
what are you,like,6'3",220?
you train?martial
arts,anything like that?
wing chun.black belt.
i bet you're pretty good at it.
you don't want to find out.
trust me.
i'm christopher chance.your mom sent me.
- my mom?
- yeah
you're not one of them?
would we still be talking if i were?
so what was in the syringe?
morphine.
interesting.
next time,you might just
want to leave it empty.
air bubble in the jugular
is lethal in seconds.
i think i know what putting an
air bubble in the jugular does.
i went to school for quite some
time to learn how not to do it.
so what ary yo a aop?
not exactly.
well,not at all,really.
your mom hired me to
get you off the island.
oh,i see.
you're a mercenary.
there's a truck up by the side of the
road with the keys still in the ignition.
if you want to get to it while it can still
do us some good,i suggest that we get moving.
any idea why they're after you?
hank benson.
your patient,the guy who died?
yeah,he was a mine foreman.
last time i came through tanarak,he complained of
labored breathing and some rash he couldn't explain,
so i diagnosed it as allergies
and gave him an antihistamine.
then,last week,i get a call.
hank had dropped dead
of a pulmonary embolism.
doesn't sound right.
really doesn't.
made no sense based on what he presented
to me when i first examined him.
so i scheduled an
autopsy with the mainland.
me they want agrius to handle the autopsy.
why didn't you let them?
a man had died in my care.
a man with a wife,three children.
and i couldn't explain
to them what happened.
i don't get to just walk away from that.
i owed it to them.
when the company kept
pressuring me really hard,
it became pretty clear that whatever hank had
died of,they didn't want it coming to light.
i couldn't let that happen.
i guess that sounds ridiculous.
not really.
a mercenary with a heart of gold?
i prefer death retardant specialist.
you okay?
i'm fine.
i just want to get out of here.
you never explained
how you got into town.
don't they have the roads blocked off?
they sent me in with an escort.
what happened to him?
all right,whoever he is,he's good.
tracks head this way
towards this small trail.
last radio communication
was ten minutes ago.
that gives him quite a head start.
top speed's a couple mimis per hour.
all right,i want cahill's
team from the south.
thompson's from the east.
let's tighten the noose.
all right,winston,i got into
the company's phone records.
all the calls in and out of agrius industry
headquarters for,like,the past seven days.
we're gonna go sing
happy birthday to janis.
- there's cake too.
- sweet.thanks,man.
all right,at any rate,12 hours ago,a call came
in from tanarak island,alaska,to jason banneker.
you know who that
is,dude?that's the agrius ceo.
so this thing goes to the top?
yep.
okay,after they hung
up,who did the ceo call?
banneker placed two outgoing calls.
first went to his attorney.
well,that makes sense.
second?second one went to
an internal number at agrius.
that's weird.
what?
second one went to the head
of research and development.
a guy named dr.david patel.
you got a problem in a
mining town in nowhere,alaska.
why the hell would you
call some egghead in r&d?
that's a good question.
probably worth asking
the egghead directly.
nah,them guys never talk.
agrius owns them.
quitter.
i don't give up so easily,dude.
i'll take care of dr.patel.
listen,i gotta run.
i'll see you later.
hey,thanks,man.
hey,do you actually work here?
no.
you know they're never gonna
let you through the roadblocks.
is there a plan for that?
yes,there is.
drive down to the marina,borrow a fishing
boat,and sort this out on the mainland.
i don't mean to sound unappreciative,but is there any
way that plan works without anyone else getting kill?
ideally.
i've worked in afghanistan and.
and rwanda and i've seen
a lot of people killed
and i'm a physician and i just
would prefer it not be on my behalf.
let's go.now
- but i thought the truck.
- truck's no longer an option.come on
there they are.
stay here.
when i fire,head that way.
- but it's a dead end.
- trast me
oh,god.
oh,god.
okay,so we just.
we just make them think that we jumped.
okay,how?
by jumping.
what?are you insane?we're
never gonna make that!
no,i mean,probably.definitely.
there they are!
on the count of three.
- one.
- oh god
isn't that what got me in
trouble in the first place?
what got you in trouble is you never had a masal maasai
warrior chief teach you how to build a smokeless fire.
and you have?
dry twigs,no air underneath the tender.
it's a little more art than
science,but once you get the.
the hang of it.
you should take off yours too.
the dock is six to seven miles from
here,and wet clothes in this temperature.
we're gonna face
hypothermia halfway there.
okay.
shouldn't take long to
dry those things out.
in the meantime,better make sure we keep our
core temperature from going down too fast.
yeah,we should take advantage
of whatever we have available.
our body heat.
that's what i was gonna.
i just want you to understand that it's.
oh,yeah,completely practical.
i agree.
hey,dude.
mission accomplished.
you called.you ididou had the guy.
- yeah
- yeah
where's the guy?
what is wrong with you?
what?
tried asking him nicely.
can i ask you a question?
please.
rwanda,afghanistan,alaska.
what's your story?
well,there's a lot of
doctors in san francisco.
the places i've been,you're lucky if the
hospitals have four walls,let alone doctors.
do i feel like i'm pushing the
same boulder up the same hill?
some days.
but i'm making a difference.
what else?
that isn't enough?
well,i've just met a lot of docs in a world
tour of hot spots,but i haven't met one
who seemed like they're trying to
get lost or leave something behind.
i doubt you're the first.
i swore an oath to help people who needed it
without any regards to what i was getting out of it.
i wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand that.
someone like me?
i've known a lot of
mercenaries from my world tour,
ani haven't met one yet who wouldn't sell out whatever
cause he was fighting for if the price was right.
somehow i doubt you're the first.
we should probably get going.
here you go,doctor.
sorry about,you know,him.
are you going to kill me?
no.
then what's he doing with my phone?
dr.patel,i'm gonna need
to ask you a few questions.
a week ago,you were on a phone call
with the ceo of agrius industries.
i need to know what that
phone call was about.
i can't talk about that.
i've got nondisclosures,a
confidentiality agreement.
wait,wait,wait,wait!
come on,man.
a mine foreman died a few
days ago in tanak,alaska.
not a cavein.not a mishap.not
an accident.not foul play.
now,ever since then,agrius industries
has been doing everything in its power
to make sure the cause of this man's death is
kept a secret,including trying to kill his doctor.
now i believe the phone call you were on is
connected to that in some way,and i need to know how.
five or six years ago.
agrius patented a
chemical called propalyde.
what is it?
it's a ticking time bomb.
sector five is clear.
get on to the harbor.
no boat leaves the
island without my okay.
copy that.
let's see if i can get
ahold of my partner.
a cell phone's not gonna
work.the towers are down.
we'll go straight to the satellite.
how?
dial 4155550112.
on star dialing now.
please hold.
where the hell are you?
we're on our way to the harbor.
i've got jessica.
well,that's good.
what's the problem?
i don't know if you're
gonna be able to get out.
what are you talking about?
when jessica tried to leave with that body,it set off all
kinds of alarms at agrius about something called propalyde.
propalyde?
yeah,it's an industrial solvent.
it's got a lot of uses,including mining,and it's a
hell of a lot more toxic than anyone cares to admit.
that's what killed hank.
well,if it is,his death could be the first in what
could amount to a billiondollar tort against agrius.
they gotta contain it.
they gotta erase any evidence that it
was on the island before it gets out.
but right now,i'm the
only evidence that's left.
what if we got other proof?
evidence that her patient
was exposed to this chemical?
like what?
soil samples from the mine.
proves he had exposure.
that plus the doctor who treated him
could tell a pretty convincing story.
will it be enough?
it's gonna have to be.
if we get to the boat
and off the island.
this doesn't end,does it?
you know enough to be dangerous,but
not enough to stop them.
if you can keep pushing,other
dominoes will fall.
they can't contain this and they know it,and they're
never gonna stop coming after you unless we stay.
we get the proof we need
to expose their coverup.
these people have done enough.
i want to see this end.
for good.
winston?
there's an airfield near the mine.
who do we know that can get a plane
to the ground within four hours?
four hours' notice to get you out of a hot zone
with a professional kill squad shooting at you?
nobody you'd want to.
what about that guy from
seattle,fred something?
frank.
deceased.
harris from calgary?
also deceased.
what about that flight
instructor from coeur d'alene?
the one with the glass eye?
he's too far away and,you know,dead.
maybe i could.
you know what?
you be at that airstrip in four hours.
i'll figure something out.
okay,check the desk,look for work schedules,call
logs,anything that might have hank's name on it.
how do we know they haven't destroyed
everything that has his name on it?
we don't.
what?
what?i'm starving.
oh,work schedule.
hank benson.shaft 183.
okay.
come on,doctor.
no lab work?no tissue
samples?not even a damn memo?
look,i'm telling you,the records of our propalyde
testing were just cleared out of our offices.
i was told it was to
arrange for safe storage.
but who knows where it went?
there is nothing that
can document any of this.
listen to me.
if we don't get something that proves
the company knew about propalyde,
we're never going to be able to get the kind
of leverage we're going to need over them.
this number appears in your call logs
four times over the last seven days.
there's no name.
who is it?
tell me the truth.
his name is jon taggart.
that's what i figured.
who is jon taggart?
he's a fixer.
corporate espionage.evidence scrubber.
agrius definitely hired this guy to
make the evidence go away on propalyde.
so what did he say to you
when he talked to you last?
keeeeyour mouth shut.you signed an nda.
blah,blah,blah.
that sort of thing?am i close?
yeah,that's exactly what he said.
you know this person?
yeah,he's kind of a shark.
no real code.a real sleazebag.
i'm sorry.you say he's a real sleazebag?
- yeah
- oh,got you.
but if we can get to him,he'll
have the evidence we need.
any idea what this
propalyde stuff looks like?
no.
all we know is that
it killed your patient?
pretty much.
should we be worried about that?
well,hank was exposed to high
doses over a month or two.
we'll be fine.
not sure i believe you,but
i do like your style.
is this how it really works?
shovel a crime into a deep,dark
hole,hope nobody finds out about it?
happens more than you think.
here.
this wood is new.
whoever closed it was in a hurry.
obviously they beat us here.
i don't understand.
why didn't she try to
make it off the island?
why'd she come here?
she's looking for proof.
mine shaft 183,we finish
prerigging it to blow?
good.send howe and stanton to the
entrance.make sure no one gets out.
let's put an end to this.
if this is it,they didn't do
a very good job of hiding it.
maybe they're not done.
all right.
we've gotta get out of here.
we've gotta get to that airfield.
what is that?
that's a preblast warning.
- but the exit's that way.
- not anymore
are you okay?
i think so.
i don't suppose you know
your way around here,do you?
maybe there's some loose
rocks we could move.
oh,god.
what?
i.
something just got lodged in there.
you think?
all right,sit down.
now.
sorry.
just wait a second.
we're gonna have to pull this one out.
oh,it's not that bad,is it?
it'll just work itself out.
what is this?is this bullet wounds?
yeah.
this one looks like barbed wire.
no.
no,wait.
yes.
sarajevo.
i.i don't even know what this one is.
oh,that's a masal ngulu blade.
seriously?
in chicago,um,i had a
patient named jose ortega.
acute liver failure.
i knew how to treat him,but the hospital and the
hmo,they kept pushing me to find a cheaper way out.
i was the only one standing
between him and them.
and you caved.
i let myself be talked into it.
i believed them when they said
they wanted what was best for him.
i swore from then on i would never walk
away from somebody i had to protect.
no matter the cost.
ngulu blade's a lot easier to get over.
how would you know?
'cause i've been there too.
sorry.
for what?
thank you.
you hear that?
that hissing?
yeah.
explosion must have.
severed one of the vent pipes.
what's it venting?
good question.
must be carbon monoxide.it's
collecting up here.
there's no other way out.
not yet.
hey,taggart.
been a while.
what?
oh,yeah.i get it.
i mean,i could be recording this,right?
if i were you,i wouldn't
say a word either.
so here's the deal.
i know you're working with agrius.
you're scrubbing evidence
over this whole propalyde mess.
and i also know,dude,even if you destroyed
it all,you kept one folder for yourself.
the one with the
really good stuff in it.
the one that guarantees you get paid
on time,they never mess with you.
problem is this.
this company's going down,bro.
i think we both know there's no reason
for you to be anywhere near it when it do.
don't you think?
****
what's in it for you?
dude.
how about doing the right thing?
how about just the satisfaction of knowing you
helped a really good person out of a rotten situation?
dude,i'm messing with you.
i know where you live and you know it.
tom's diner.
just leave the folder in the
back booth by the can.all right?
tell your wife i said hi.
see you,taggart.
what are you doing?
carrying an acetylene tank.
i realize that.where?
map says there's a tiein
to another mine shaft.
it's marked "sealed off.
" okay,but it's still wall.
if we're lucky,not for long.come on
get down.
what the hell was that?
sounded like a secondary explosion.
give me the map.
what are you looking for?
how i'd get out if i were him.
here.
i need eyes on shaft
go!
go!
no.
not another cliff.
- it's just a little one.come on.
- no
see?
it's not so bad.
take the wheel.
get down!
chance,the other side!
come on.we're going.
going?going where?
who the hell are you?
aw,that doesn't matter.
i know who you are,though.
you're jason banneker,ceo
of agrius industries.
it says it in this too.
where'd you get these?
well,i hate to ruin the surprise.
it's all gonna come out at your trial.
come on,jason.
you knew what happened to that miner.
you knew propalyde was
toxic and then you hid it.
so here's how it's gonna
go for you and agrius.
you're gonna get raked over the coals.
your stock price is going
right in the crapper.
fines.
payout to hank benson's family
is gonna make your head swim
and then you are gonna have a nice extended
stay at eglin minimum security prison.
that's pretty much set in stone as
far as you're concerned,believe that.
and if you're lucky.
well,that'll be the end.
get on with it.
i can make sure you go away for
conspiracy to murder jessica shaw.
only it won't be at federal summer camp.
it'll be at lompoc.
you know,for real prison.
two to a cell.
ten to a shower.trust me.
you wouldn't do well there at all.
what exactly is it you want?
couple things.
one.
nobody messes with jessica shaw.
not during the propalyde trial.
ever.
and two,you take out your checkbook and
write a check out to me for whatever's in it.
now you do that and the murder
will just stay in my pocket.
but you mess around.
bye,jason.
so who do i make this out to?
hey,do you mind?
what are you doing?
you know,i don't know if you
noticed it,but i'm working here.
i'm trying to clean up
another one of your messy.
tracks.
hey,you want to take carmine for a walk?
no.
neither do i,so this is
how he gets his exercise.
lucky dog.
i'll just,um.
be in my office.
did i interrupt?
no,no,no.
he's just always grumpy like that.
so what's up?
i was just in the area.
went to see my mother.
how is she?
grateful.
very grateful.
as am i.
so where you winging off to next?
what makes you think
i'm not sticking around?
well,you don't really strike me as a pursecarrying
kind of woman,but you're carrying a pue.
bandaid on your arm says you
probably just got a vaccination.
i'm guessing yellow fever.
comfortable clothes,travel shoes.
your mom told me.
thanks again.
if you're ever in
dakar,just give me a shout.
hey,there's a great french
bistro on medina street.
well,it's worth checking out.
maybe i will.
oh,one more thing.
a little somehing
from agrius industries.
what's this for?
that's some travel money.
so you can keep pushing
your boulder uphill.
thank you.
carmine!
good boy.
