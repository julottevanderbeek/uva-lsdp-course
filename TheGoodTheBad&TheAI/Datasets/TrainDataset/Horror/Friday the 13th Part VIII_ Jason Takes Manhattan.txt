We live in claustrophobia.
A land of steel and concrete...
There is no escape,
nor do we want it.
We've come to thrive on it
and each other.
You can't get the adrenaline pumping
without the terror, good people.
MAN :
You've been listening to WGAZ...
This request has gone
all the way out to Crystal Lake...
...and the senior class
of Lakeview High.
- That's us.
- All right!
MAN : They'll be graduating on
the 13th of this month...
......and we wish them the best
of luck and success...
...when they come to visit
our seductive city.
Our lure is a great one,
young friends, but beware.
The city of lights
casts many shadows indeed.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Gotta throw the anchor over.
- Okay.
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.
Come on, Jimmy,
something's bothering you.
Just that we're right around
that summer camp...
...where all those murders
took place.
- What murders?
- You don't wanna know about it.
- Tell me.
- Forget about it, Suzi.
The guy's dead now.
Somewhere at the bottom of this lake...
...if you believe the stories.
What stories?
There was this boy
named Jason Voorhees.
JIM: He drowned in Crystal Lake
about 30 years ago.
None of the counselors heard him.
Help!
JIM: A bunch of years went by,
and everyone forgot about it.
And that's when the murders
started to happen.
Jason did it?
His mother blamed the counselors
for her son's death...
...and she tried to kill them all, but she got
her head chopped off by one of them.
JIM: Legend has it that Jason came back
to get even...
...vowing to kill every teenager
in the area.
And every now and then,
the murders just start up.
Forget about it, Suzi,
they're just stories.
Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
- Come on, I'm serious.
All right. I'll go check it out.
Jim?
Jimmy?
Stop screwing around, Jim.
I mean it.
Got you good, Suzi.
All right, all right,
so I'm a major ass.
SUZY: And you'll never do it again?
JIM: And I'll never do it again.
- Come on, forgive me?
- No, heh.
Jason?
No. No, please, no!
No. No. No, please, no!
No! No! No!
No! No!
Well, Toby's been awful quiet
back there.
RENNIE: Yeah, I guess he's a little
nervous about the trip.
Here.
Go on, open it.
Stephen King supposedly used it
in high school.
I don't know what to say.
Rennie, you are the best student
I have ever had.
You have a real gift.
And if there's anybody that can
make use of that pen, it's you.
WOMAN:
Hi!
- Hello, Charles.
CHARLES: Colleen.
You know, this cruise was your idea.
So at the very least...
...you could show up on time.
- Has everyone checked in?
- No.
Jim Miller and Suzi Donaldson
never showed up...
...and I'm more than a little concerned.
Well, don't be. They probably
decided to explore each other...
...rather than New York, heh.
Oh, that's nice. We're running
five minutes late already.
There's someone else coming too.
You never should have
brought her here.
It's up to Rennie to decide
what she wants to do.
She doesn't know what she wants.
She never had a stable life
till she came to live with me.
And she certainly doesn't
have one now either.
I'm her legal guardian,
not you or anybody else.
And I know what's best for her.
End of discussion.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
MAN: Have you decided on your
departure protocol, admiral?
Actually, I thought
I'd leave that honor to my son.
- Dad, I don't think that's necessary.
- Relinquishing command...
...of the motor vessel Lazarus
to Captain Sean Robertson.
But, uh, before you take the helm,
take this.
Something old and something new.
I used that sextant
when I was your age.
Now they got those goddamn
computers that do all the work for you.
Have you decided on
a plan of departure, captain?
SEAN:
Okay.
How about we, uh, start up the engines
and come around 180 degrees?
Aren't you forgetting something, mister?
SEAN:
Um....
Send out the international
maritime signal.
Followed by a security broadcast
warning other ships...
...that we are underway.
This voyage is doomed.
Heh. Yeah, tell me about it.
BOY 1:
Bye!
BOY 2: Have fun in New York!
BOY 1: Bye!
- Rennie.
- Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
RENNIE:
We changed our minds.
- I got you a present.
- But I didn't get you one.
Forget it.
It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Sean, I love it.
You see,
I thought when we got there...
...maybe we could hike
to the top of the statue...
...if you felt like it.
It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
That sounds wonderful.
Mr. Robertson.
Your father was looking for you.
I guess I'll see you later.
What are you doing here?
We've already been through all of this.
I'm sorry, Uncle Charles.
Please don't be upset with me.
I'm not upset, I'm just...
...concerned.
Is this ax awesome or what?
Too cool, J.J.
Your parents really came through.
J.J.: Heh, no lie.
- Heh.
Hey, I hear there's this big
power room downstairs.
We can get supreme concert-hall echo.
So come on down and shoot
a basement tape on me, okay?
Yeah. But I gotta get some
"shockumentary" footage first.
Heh, oh, man. Don't tell me you're still
trying to scam on Tamara.
How long have we
known each other?
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne.
She's not interested in you,
only what you can do for her.
- She is a user.
- She's sexy.
So what? So is this guitar.
Yeah. Well, I'll talk to you later,
all right?
There's a big storm
predicted for tonight.
Rennie, you're making a big mistake.
It's not too late
to put you back onshore.
If Miss Van Deusen
knew how afraid you were of....
She didn't push me into this.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I don't even know what I'm afraid of,
Uncle Charles.
I can't even remember when it started.
Don't you think it's time I found out
and got over it?
Facing your fear
doesn't always conquer it.
I'm staying.
Okay.
J.J.: Ah, man, this place
is aching for a video!
Wayne, you're an asshole.
So, what do you think?
Time for some personal experiences
to fuel our minds?
I agree.
JASON:
Mommy?
Help! Help me!
Help!
Toby!
TAMARA:
Is that a muscular bod or what?
MAN:
One more, one more!
TAMARA:
He's undefeated, you know that?
Julius is the only senior
I'd even consider doing it with.
- He is so good-looking.
- Heh.
Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock.
Look sensual.
I think it's time for some
recreational activity, girl.
Have you seen my niece anywhere?
Uh, yeah, I think she's motivating
downstairs, Mr. McCulloch.
Uh, what's the problem?
Well, senior predictions
started five minutes ago...
...and she hasn't shown up yet.
Oh, well, uh, maybe some of us
don't want our futures predicted.
Heh, well, in your case,
I'm sure that's true.
Nighttime is the right time.
No, thanks.
Don't be a lightweight.
This is top-dollar toot.
It's not that. It's just, you know...
...if we get caught, I could lose my
science scholarship and everything.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva.
Do you really think I'm gonna risk
getting caught?
- Jesus!
- Have you guys seen my dog?
I think he came this way.
No, we haven't.
Did you care for a hit?
No, thanks.
Real space cadet.
I wonder if she'll narc on us.
Here, boy!
Oh, yeah. Ready to party
and then some.
CHARLES: What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.
Are you girls using drugs?
Do you think I would use drugs,
Mr. McCulloch?
We were just exploring the ship.
I'll be coming around to your stateroom
in exactly 15 minutes, Miss Mason...
...so you better have your biology project
ready, or I'll be phoning your parents.
They're out of town.
Uh-huh, well, uh, I'll make sure
that you remain onboard...
...while your classmates
are out seeing the sights.
- Now what?
- Relax.
I've got McCulloch covered.
That narc'ing bitch niece of his
is a different matter.
Rumor has it she's a teensy bit
afraid of the water.
MAN: Nice fight, Julius. Guess I need
to work on my left-right-left combo.
Hey, listen.
No hard feelings, man, okay?
What do you say we track down
those babes later?
Julius?
- So are you having fun yet?
- Yeah, a lot.
Heh. Uh-huh.
Come on, level with me.
Hey, if you can't trust me,
who can you trust?
It was an accident, I swear.
Stay calm and grab
the life preserver, Rennie!
I've got you. Come on. I've got you.
- That was truly excellent, heh.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Time to check out the waiters.
Look, I think I'll pass, okay?
- What?
- I'll see you later.
Heh. Some friend you are.
SEAN: Come on, grab her hand!
COLLEEN: That was close.
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
Come here. Sit down. Sit down.
- Grab her some towels, okay?
- Okay.
She's fine. She's-- Just go back to
what you were doing, okay? Everybody.
Care to talk about it?
I can't swim.
No kidding.
You ever thought about taking lessons?
It's not that simple.
Good God!
- Take it easy, Charles. She's all right.
- Oh, I can see that.
You've done a wonderful job supervising
the kids. What the hell happened?
- It wasn't her fault.
- Give me those towels.
You stay away from her. Both of you!
He's come back,
and you're all gonna die.
Just leave me alone!
JASON:
Help me! Help me!
TAMARA:
The door's open.
I'm in no mood for any more
of your stall tactics, Miss Mason.
Where is your final project?
Wouldn't you like
a glass of champagne first, Charles?
Where did you get this?
Why, I packed it...
...just for us.
Well, that's it.
You're not, uh, stepping off this ship
until we return home.
But I haven't even shown you
my biology project.
Hey....
What do you think you're doing?
I mean....
Now, you stop that!
I mean, really.
Take a closer look, Charles.
I wanna make sure I've labeled
all my organs correctly.
Get-- Get off of me!
I don't believe this.
What do you think you're--?
I'm your teacher, young lady.
Well, now you've gone and done it.
Not only are you going home...
...but I will-- I will see to it personally...
...that you spend next year
back in a high-school classroom.
What is going on here?
TAMARA: Did you get anything good?
- Oh, yeah. Very kinky.
- Give me that tape. Give it to me!
- Come and get it.
You're going to be very,
very sorry, young lady.
And as for you, you can forget
about attending any film school.
Ever!
Relax, Wayne, he's not
gonna risk trying a thing.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.
Listen, uh, this is gonna sound
supremely lame, and I know it...
...but, um, I've had the major hots for you
since our sophomore year, Tamara.
That's so sweet, Wayne.
And I really would love
to stay and chat...
...but I really am pressed for time.
So let's be sure to get together later.
Okey-doke?
- Yeah, I just thought---
- Yeah.
WAYNE:
But I-- Maybe we could--
Wayne, you're an asshole.
TAMARA:
Oh, no! No!
No!
No! No, no!
Let's kick in the stabilizers, Mr. Carlson.
Keep the seas off the quarter.
Yes, sir.
These kids are in
for one hell of a storm.
- How old is your boy now, Carlson?
- Nineteen months.
Tremendous age.
Take some advice.
Don't push him too hard.
Yeah.
- Take the helm, would you, Jim?
- Certainly, sir.
I double-checked those
lifeboat stations too, Carl....
Oh, my God!
- Can he really take us home?
- He can call the Coast Guard cutter for you.
What about you? Are you staying here?
I'm never gonna be
what he wants me to be...
...so I guess I'm going with you.
Oh, Jesus!
Dad?
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
RENNIE: No.
SEAN :
Attention, everybody. Attention.
Miles, you seen J.J.?
- She's supposed to be jamming down--
- Shh.
SEAN: Uh-- This is an emergency.
I want you all to come to the bridge.
What the fuck is this?
Mayday.
Mayday.
Mayday!
Shit.
This is the motor vessel Lazarus.
Sean, what's going on?
WAYNE: Jesus Christ.
Please, can anybody out there
hear me?
MAN : This is the
Coast Guard cutter Dallas.
What's the nature
of your problem, Lazarus?
Thank God.
Hello?
- Hello, are you there?
- I demand to know what is going on!
Christ.
Sean, I'm....
Where's the radio?
It's dead.
You're all gonna die.
You're the last ones.
He's come back for you.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Jason Voorhees.
You're insane! Jason Voorhees
has been dead for years.
He came down the river,
and he's gotten onboard.
He walks this ship here and now.
Yes, a killer walks this ship, all right.
And it's certainly none of us!
- You bastard!
- What are--? What are you doing?
You're the one who's insane.
That lunatic has been spouting off
about Jason...
...ever since he came aboard.
- And it's no coincidence.
COLLEEN: Doesn't prove he's the one.
Walking corpses are not real.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, these dead
bodies are sure enough real, all right?
Now, I say we regroup...
...and let's go find this motherfucker
before he finds us, huh?
- Are you with me?
- Watch your mouth, young man!
And you'll do no such thing.
I'm in charge here!
Ah, school is out, McCulloch. Okay?
Let's go.
You come back here!
Christ. Where's Rennie?
She's dropping the anchors.
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said that we
needed to drop the anchors.
I'm the one you should be listening to.
Do you think dropping anchor
in the middle of a storm...
...makes any sense whatsoever?
Come on.
Tamara?
Tamara, did you hear
the announcement?
Help me!
I managed to scrounge this shit up
in the game rooms and hallways.
All right, grab what you want.
- What are you taking, Julius?
- Nothing...
...but this gun.
J.J.?
J.J.?
Are you down here?
J.J.?
We got a major problem, Wayne.
Shit, I can't see a damn thing.
No.
No.
J.J.
Did you find Rennie?
She's locked safely in her room,
no thanks to either of you.
Have you brought her
back on course yet?
COLLEEN:
He's doing the best he can.
He's the son of a captain,
for chrissakes.
He ought to be able to operate
this thing. Well, do something!
- It worked. We're back on course.
- Good!
- What's that?
- The fire alarm.
COLLEEN:
We've already thought about that.
Nobody could possibly see a flare gun
in this storm.
There's only one person who needs to
see it. I'm gonna find that deck hand.
But what about the fire?
- How do we know there is one?
COLLEEN: What are you talking about?
Use some common sense.
Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...
...the same kind of panic
caused by suggesting...
...that Jason Voorhees is alive
and aboard this ship.
Enough is enough.
Help me!
JASON:
Help! Help me!
Rennie.
I don't understand
what's happening to me!
- What is that?
- The power room.
All right, listen, everybody.
I want you to stay here until
I get back with the others, all right?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
Water's gotten into the engines.
We have to get everybody
off the ship!
Rennie! Hang on!
RENNIE:
Sean!
Rennie! What the hell--?
Let go of her!
She never should have set foot
on this ship. It's all your fault!
This is Jason's fault.
Not another word about Jason,
do you hear me?
SEAN:
No, I don't!
It's time you listen to me,
if you want off this ship alive.
Thank God.
I just lowered the lifeboat.
We have to go.
COLLEEN: Wait! I left the others
in the restaurant.
There is no more restaurant.
Come on, honey.
CHARLES:
Get back!
Son of a bitch!
COLLEEN:
Come on, Charles.
COLEEN:
Here, grab my hand!
Come on.
Hurry up!
Come on.
COLLEEN: Watch it. Watch it.
Come on, now.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Sean! Careful.
CHARLES: One last step. Come on!
Grab on to my arm. That's it.
- Start rowing!
COLLEEN: Come on!
SEAN:
Come on! Come on!
SEAN:
Julius!
Pull him in.
SEAN:
Keep rowing!
I hope you can find shore soon,
captain.
We all don't wanna drown out here.
Do you have any idea
where we are, Sean?
Hey. Hey, Sean.
Come on, man.
I made it. So can you, huh.
All right, man.
Hey, man. Yo. Yo, wake up!
Oh, shit! Check it out! Heh. Damn!
We're in New York! Woo-hoo!
You did it, man! You did it!
We are in New York!
New York City! Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
I don't believe it, we made it!
JULIUS :
If I can make it there
There must be a phone
around here somewhere.
Wonderful choice of places
to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Wonderful.
COLLEEN: I can't believe we made it.
CHARLES: I can't believe we're still alive.
COLLEEN:
We are all very lucky.
Give me your money.
Everybody shut up
and give him the money. Now!
Give me the money. Come on.
Here.
MAN:
Got some good shit here, homes.
You got that right.
Give me your wallet. Come on!
- Now, ain't that sweet.
- Bastard!
Go ahead, Superman, be a hero.
- Hey, come on, now--
- You got a problem, dad?
No!
- Please don't hurt her.
- Hurt this princess?
Would I do that?
You look like a real party girl,
princess.
You wanna go on a date
with me and my friend?
If you're free, that is.
Follow us, we blow her fucking
head off, comprende?
So, what, we just gonna stand here?
Let's go.
Julius! Calm down, will you?
You heard what he said. He'll kill her!
We have to find the police.
Well, look.
I think we'll be more productive
if we split up, okay?
- All right, but, Charles, suppose we--
- Colleen. No discussions now, please!
RENNIE:
Help! Stop it! Help! Somebody help me!
MAN:
Shut the fuck up!
Welcome to the Casbah, princess.
Please, don't hurt me.
Loosen up, baby. You'll feel
way better if you're stoned.
Better slang us some more 'caine,
JoJo. We only got a half load here.
We're in for a long night.
It's your parade, princess.
It can be smooth, it can be rough.
It's your choice.
Come on, baby.
Lay back and enjoy it.
I think I'm in love.
Forgot my money, homes.
Who the fuck are you?
You're dead, fuckhead.
MAN:
Shit!
Come on. Operator, this is
an emergency, get me the police.
Use the combos, keep the feet light.
This is it.
Take your best shot...
...motherfucker.
- Rennie? What did they do to you?
- He's here, Sean.
- Jason is here.
- Oh, God.
We have to find the others now.
- Freeze!
- Ah.
It's okay, she's with me.
My apologies, miss.
Are you all right?
SEAN:
Hey!
Rennie! Rennie. Rennie.
Oh, thank God.
Are you okay?
SEAN: Mr. McCulloch,
Jason is here in New York.
- Rennie saw him.
- Just shut up about Jason, will you?
Is it true, Rennie?
You're right. I find it a tall tale indeed,
but you seem like honest folk...
...so I'm inclined to believe
at least some of what you say.
Yeah, well, first order of business
is to find Julius.
COP: I'm sure he'll pop up
soon enough. I'll call for backup.
COP:
Oh, Jesus!
Dispatch! Dispatch!
COLLEEN: Open the door!
Let's get out of here!
CHARLES:
The handle!
CHARLES:
Hold it! What are you doing?
For God's sake, Rennie, slow down!
SEAN:
Come on!
- Rennie!
- Quickly! Let's move!
Miss Van Deusen!
It's so pretty today.
CHARLES:
Yeah.
Perfect day for swimming.
Hmm?
You know, young lady,
you've been coming out here...
...every summer for the last three years,
and you still haven't learned how to swim.
I'll take some lessons this time.
I promise.
Now, that's what you said last year.
I think the time has come
for your first swimming lesson.
You don't wanna end up drowning
like that Voorhees boy, do you?
He never learned how to swim either.
And he's still in the
bottom of this lake.
- He is not.
- Yes, indeed, he is.
And he's ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're telling a lie.
Am I? Let's find out.
You better swim, Rennie,
before Jason pulls you down.
- I-- I can't!
- Yes, you can, and you will!
Come on! Rennie, swim!
You pushed me into the lake.
Rennie, I....
I was only trying to teach you.
You almost killed me.
I was drowning.
I pulled you out.
I saved your life.
You son of a bitch.
He was down there.
Rennie!
Just keep away from her!
Rennie!
You. You.
It's-- It's not possible!
Please! Wait!
I'm begging you! Please!
I was at school when they told me.
"Rennie, your parents died
in a car accident."
It just seems like
everybody I care about...
...I lose.
That's not gonna happen this time.
Help!
MAN 1: What are you doing?
MAN 2: What is this?
MAN 3: This isn't my stop!
MAN 4: Come on!
MAN 5:
Get it moving!
RENNIE:
Oh, my God.
It's over.
RENNIE: Somebody please help us!
- Go!
You are dead meat, slimebag!
Yo, man. It's cool.
It's cool, man. It's cool.
Times Diner. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're open till 3 a.m., like always.
You've got to call the police.
There's a pay phone in back.
But it's broke.
Look, you don't understand,
there is a maniac trying to kill us.
Welcome to New York.
Son of a bitch. Unh!
Come on!
Come on!
What the hell are you kids
doing down here?
Can you help us get out of here?
Sure can, but we haven't got
a minute to spare.
- What do you mean?
MAN: Toxic waste, son.
The sewer floods out with the stuff
every night at midnight...
...less than ten minutes from now.
Come on, follow me.
You didn't get me in the lake,
and you're not gonna get me now!
Sean.
Sean, get up!
Get up, Sean!
Go!
Climb!
Shit!
JASON:
Mommy! Don't let me drown!
Mommy!
Help! Help!
I hear there's a statue here
that's, uh, 22 stories tall.
Toby!
