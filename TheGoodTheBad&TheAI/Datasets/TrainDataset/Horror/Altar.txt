I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with Y.
Yorkshire.
You can't SEE Yorkshire.
Yellow.
I don't see anything yellow.
Penny, these moors
have been inspiration for a lot
of great British artists.
Maybe they'll be good for you, too.
Look, kids!
There's Heathcliff chasing Catherine
across the moor.
I don't see anybody.
Just a load of...empty.
Creepy.
I think it looks nice.
Wait till your mom's done with it.
Rock stars and royalty
will be lining up around the block
to get into one of Brad Mason's
parties. What block?
All I see is green stuff.
It's only for six months.
Six months?
I thought it was four months.
It depends what I find.
If there's woodworm and dry rot,
it could take longer.
Come on!
We're going to enjoy ourselves.
This is an adventure.
An adventure that pays well.
I'll drink to that.
There it is!
Who'd pay money to stay in a dump
like this?
Come on. Let's get settled in.
Mum, there's no signal. What kind
of hotel doesn't have bathrooms?
It wasn't a hotel. It was a B&B.
There's a bathroom down the hall.
Yeah, still!
Is there no water? No. Sorry,
darling. I'll fix it tomorrow.
Ooh!
Budge up. Let me in.
Think you're going to be able
to work here?
I think I could work anywhere.
But right now,
I just really want to go to sleep.
Right.
Three, two, one.
Yeah. It's perfect.
What was it before? A games room.
When it was built,
it was an artist's studio.
Radcliffe had an artist?
No. Radcliffe WAS an artist,
a landscape painter.
Shouldn't wonder,
with all this landscape lying about.
It's not too late to join the fun.
I'd get crazy up here. When has
that been bad for an artist? True.
Perhaps you'll make something
worth selling.
What?
And ruin my marriage?
Is she all right?
She has a broken jaw.
The car's a write-off.
Jesus!
It could be serious.
They want to do a brain scan.
I'm sorry, Meg. I can't leave her.
Maybe you could get Tony to help?
But Tony's on a build in Scotland.
Look, they're calling me back.
What about that Italian guy?
Can you hear me? Frank?
Greg left. Couldn't get out of here
fast enough.
Is everything all right?
Celia's had a car accident.
God! Is she all right?
Yeah.
But Frank's got to look after her.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I'll...find a local guy?
Can you help me with something?
It must be nailed shut.
What's in there?
I've no idea, but from the skylight,
it's worth a look.
That's it. Nearly there.
Ooh. Are you all right?
Yeah. It's just a nick.
I'm all right.
Come on. After three.
Two, three!
Ooh!
What do you think this place was?
I have no idea!
It's not on any of the plans.
I wonder why.
What are you going to do with it?
Turn it into a playroom
for one of Brad's kids?
I have a feeling
this house is full of surprises.
What the hell is that?
Wow!
Right. I've got a builder to find.
I'm looking for Mr Donnelly.
Sean Donnelly?
I'm not available.
I've come about a long-term job.
Radcliffe.
Yeah. Wow. How do you know that?
You're the American banker's
designer from London.
Why do I get the feeling
you don't approve? I don't mind
who lives in that house.
I just don't want
to turn it into Disneyland.
That's not what we're doing.
Is it true he hasn't set foot
in the place?
That he bought it on the internet?
He doesn't want to see it
until it's fully restored.
Many of those skills are long gone,
Miss...?
Hamilton, Meg.
What do you know
about Yorkshire stone?
I know that if you try and fix a
bronze dial plate by F Baker & Sons
to a Mark Blanchard pedestal
using hydrated cement paste
it'll probably corrode
in three years.
You need to use lime mortar
and a French binding agent.
If you want it to last.
Mrs Hamilton?
! Sorry!
I'm doing laps.
What the hell?
Harper, can you...?
What is that horrible thing?
It's a fountain.
It used to live outside the back
of the house.
It won't be horrible
once you've cleaned it up. No, Mum.
I've got books to read for school.
Mum? Mm-hm.
Have a look.
What is it?
Come and see this.
What?
What is that?
I don't know. It's a flare
or a reflection or something.
No. It looks like...
Is that a ghost?
Woooo
Knock twice
if you can hear me!
Blow it up on your screen.
Don't touch my...
OK. Sorry.
What do you want to look at?
The picture.
Now I don't see anything.
How can it be there and not here?
I don't know. Printer's screwed.
It's a rubbish printer.
Maybe it's a different picture.
It's not! Look!
It's the only one I took.
See? Nothing there.
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
I'm starving.
And you should be doing
differential calculus!
OK.
It's nothing. It's in your head.
Mrs Hamilton?
Donnelly. I knocked.
Figured you couldn't hear me.
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
You did want me here at four?
Yes, yes. Sorry, I was miles away.
What have you found?
I don't know.
I think it's a bricked-up doorway.
That would have been the root cellar
when the house was built.
People closed them up when fridges
came in. OK. Give me a second.
I'm just going to patch this up.
I can only do three days a week
and my lad even less.
Well, I'll take what I can get.
I think we should start at the top
of the house and work our way down.
As I said,
my client wants to see the place
returned to its original state.
I think we might get away
with mostly decorative work...
What was that?
It's just the boiler.
Are you sure that's what it was?
It's not going to do that all night?
Can you go check, Dad?
Your mum wears the plumber's pants
in this house, sweetie.
Ooh!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to shut down
the bloody boiler.
I'm not finished with you yet.
Jesus!
That felt great!
You had a shower?
Piping hot and great pressure.
I've got to hand it to you, Meg.
I turned the boiler off.
Yeah. Very funny
I...thought I saw a woman
wandering around the garden.
Probably a nosy neighbour curious
about the aliens from London.
Maybe I'm just tired.
Do you know what I think?
I think that you're more beautiful
now than when we first met.
I don't believe you.
Why?
I think you wish...
I'd never cut my hair.
I'm obviously not the woman
you fell in love with, Alec.
I don't know what's happened to her.
This is your moment.
You're perfect as you are now.
But that's not ME.
Mm.
Mm.
Get your fucking hands off me!
Get away!
Get away, Alec, please!
No!
Stop it!
Penny?
Penny, the door's locked.
The key must have dropped out.
Can you see it on the floor?
Penny? Have you got your inhaler?
Shit!
I'm coming!
Coming!
Shit!
Penny, stand clear.
Where's your inhaler?
Here we go.
Exhale...and in.
Big one. Good girl. And again.
And breathe in. There we go.
Let the medicine work. Good girl.
Deep breath. You're OK.
There was a woman.
She...was here with me.
No. That's just a bad dream.
No, it's not.
What's happening?
Don't worry.
She just had an asthma attack.
Go back to bed, darling. No way.
I'm sleeping in your bed now.
Are you OK?
So, who wants to go
to the beach today?
There's a town called Whitby,
not far from here.
That's where Dracula landed.
They put him in a coffin because
the sunlight burnt his skin.
Shut up, Harper. It was the centre
of the creepy universe.
Since when do you work all night?
I'm on the brink of something.
Where's the tea? We don't have tea.
Don't tell me you forgot the tea?
No. We don't drink it.
There's coffee on the stove.
Penny saw a ghost.
What?
She had a nightmare. She got
wound up and had an asthma attack.
It was a real fucking ghost.
Penny!
What kind of language is that,
young lady?
It's the language of a girl
who's been neglected by her father,
which is why you're taking them
to the bloody seaside today.
Today's no good.
Alec!
Alec, we agreed you'd look after
the kids till they start school.
And I will. Just not today.
I'm in the middle of something.
I'm very pleased for you.
And you can pick it up
when they start school next week.
This isn't something
you can pick up and drop off.
It's important that you position it
in line with the study window.
Ten yards from the house.
It's this distance here.
There were cuts and scars
up her arms. I didn't dream it, Mum.
I know it must seem like that,
but sometimes we can't tell.
Then why was the door locked?
Penny, the door doesn't have a lock.
The door was jammed.
Jammed?
Old houses move over time.
Things stick.
You know Emily? Her uncle bought
this place which was haunted.
He got this guy
who sorted it out in one visit.
Have you been Tweeting about this?
We've got to do something.
It's not a priest. He just says
he was born with a gift.
My God! You've contacted him.
No, Mum.
Emily sent me his home page so
we could check him out. Let me see.
You've got to be kidding.
He's super-discreet.
Promise me that you won't talk
about this online any more. Mum!
This is my work you're dissing,
Penny!
I'm going to get a reputation.
Fix yourselves some lunch.
I'm going to check on the guys.
Donnelly!
"Sorry we missed you."
What happened?
We have a little problem.
Wow!
My lad's not normally superstitious.
Neither am I.
But we thought, with the history
of the place and all,
you'd want to keep it covered.
I thought you understood.
The history of the place is
exactly what we're here to restore.
Then I'm afraid you're on your own.
Why is it such a big deal?
I've got a reputation, Mrs Hamilton.
Small,
but enough to keep me in work.
If word spread that Sean Donnelly
invited the wrong publicity,
I'll lose my business.
What kind of publicity? There are
rumours that Radcliffe built
the place as a sort of temple.
It was so long ago, thankfully,
it's all they are - rumours.
Now I'm not so sure.
It's just a work of art.
No. It's a work of the devil.
That is ridiculous!
Is it? He killed his wife
in some sort of ritual.
She haunted him day and night until
he threw himself from the window.
If I were you, I'd persuade
your American banker to tear it down
and start from scratch.
You've been in there all day?
How was the beach?
You missed the phone engineer.
I'm sorry, babe.
Can you stop walking away from me?
I'm trying to talk to you.
Alec, this is important.
Donnelly's just quit.
I've got to find someone else.
I really need you to pitch in.
Would you sit for me? This
is serious. A couple of sessions.
I can't do this on my own!
I'm in the thick of it, Meg.
Look, this is our pay cheque. OK?
It's our only pay cheque.
Since your last show, we don't have
any money. I understand all that.
But what I'm doing
will change our lives for ever.
Alec, I'm really glad for you
that you found something new,
but right now,
I just need your help.
OK.
OK?
OK.
Thanks.
Really?
I'll set aside some time
in the afternoons.
Thank God!
Hello?
Is that you, petal?
Who is this?
Agh! Agh! God!
! You scared me.
What are you doing in here?
Well, I... I just...
I was answering the phone.
I guess the engineer
must have connected it, after all.
Phone?
You didn't hear the phone?
Listen, I don't think
we should leave this light.
Did you put this light on?
No. I thought you did.
OK. Let's get out of here.
Let's not do this in here.
Can we go upstairs?
Alec, can we go up? This room
really gives me the creeps.
I don't like it in here. No!
Alec, please, no!
I don't like it here, please!
Please, Alec. No.
I don't like it.
Hi. Thanks for coming back.
Just through there.
On the table at the end.
Unless that's been converted to
digital, it's never going to work.
It was working last night,
but dead again this morning.
Well, I can't see how
that's possible. It's not connected.
I can't even see
a telephone socket down there.
Madam?
OK. Let's go.
Absolutely, Bradley. Yeah.
Not only are we on schedule, we're
also finding some amazing stuff!
Great.
Many original features are intact.
Which is why, I imagine,
you wanted to buy it.
I didn't buy it. I inherited it.
Inherited it?
Yeah. I thought you knew that. No.
The will showed up after 150 years,
buried in some trust somewhere.
The original owner had a sister -
my great-great aunt.
You just discovered that?
Yeah.
I guess Victorian paperwork
was not all it's cracked up to be.
The only condition was that it's
maintained in its original state.
All I need to do is to get
the executor to check your work
and they'll sign over the deeds.
What will you do with it?
Sell it. Keep up the good work!
Hello?
Hello?
I believe you found artwork
of historical interest in the house.
I'm sorry. You are...?
Charles Kendrick Walker.
I've always wondered
about this place.
You've been talking to Donnelly?
I'd love to take a peak.
We're not open to the public.
You misunderstand, Mrs Hamilton.
I'm somewhat of an expert
on the era. I may be able to help.
I don't need any help, thank you.
Word spreads pretty fast round here.
Good as well as bad.
If we can dispel superstition,
encourage people to regard Radcliffe
with fascination, rather than fear,
we may be able to restore it
to the status it deserves.
I'm a historian, Mrs Hamilton.
Believe me, you need my expertise.
Good heavens!
The glass is 1860, but I think
the design is a lot earlier.
It goes back to the ancients.
You know what it is?
A map of the human soul.
Rosicrucians call it
the Emerald Tablet of Hermes.
Radcliffe was an alchemist?
Yes. A very good one.
What happened here? I guess somebody
didn't like her face.
The glass was shattered. It must
have been hit with something hard.
Will you be able to restore it?
If I can find out
what she looked like, yes.
There's a painting at the Victorian
Museum of Art in Leeds.
Radcliffe was a landscape artist,
but he left one portrait
of his wife, Isabella.
This amazing illumination
features in the background.
Great.
I'll check it out.
There would have been an effigy
of the Hermetic ray hanging over
the tablet.
The altar.
Will you be restoring the house
to its original state?
Yes. That's the plan.
Not really sure what to do
with this room, though.
Do? You said you were going
to restore it.
My employer doesn't really
have a use for a Rosicrucian altar.
And then there are the rumours
around town.
These are simple folk, Mrs Hamilton.
The miracle of metempsychosis is not
something they would understand.
But Radcliffe did kill his wife?
It was an accident.
He loved her more than life itself.
Why don't you meet my husband?
I'm afraid I'm a little pushed
for time.
You will put in a good word for us
in town?
I'll do my best.
I think that was a tie!
Hi. Is there anything to eat?
There are cold cuts in the fridge
and there's that bread you like.
Can you grab something?
"Hi, Pen. How was your bike ride?"
Internet's working.
My God! That's her!
The woman in my room! That's her!
It's just some stupid picture.
Why were you looking at that?
It came up when I was researching.
Mum, that is definitely her.
Penny, calm down.
Look, it's very common.
It's like a deja vu.
When you're tired and stressed,
you feel like you've seen someone
in a dream and you haven't.
I promise you! That is the woman
with the cuts up her arm!
You said she was looking out the
window. Yes. How can you be sure?
She looked at me. I saw her face!
Please, we've got to leave now.
Please!
What's going on?
Can you go? I'll be up in a minute.
What have I done wrong now?
Just go upstairs now,
please!
Listen, Penny, I know you're upset.
If you're really not happy here,
I could try and organise for you
to live with Grandpa in London.
Would you like to do that
for a couple of months? No, Mum.
Please, we have to all leave
right now.
I can't leave.
I have to finish this job. We need
the money. Try and understand, OK?
I've fixed the hot water.
I'll run you a nice hot bath.
We'll all snuggle down
in the bed together
and watch a movie on the iPad, yeah?
Something, you know, like a comedy.
Was it Reverend Green in the cellar
with the lead pipe?
Who's that?
May I help you?
Nigel Lean at your service.
This the old spooky pile?
God! You're the ghost whisperer,
aren't you?
This is Bessie. I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I know... Mum?
At least show him round, OK?
So, you're a plumber as well?
A man's got to make a living.
I'd have thought exorcism...
I don't charge for my cleansing
work. There's rules about that.
But I will take a cup of coffee.
Don't tell me. Milk and two sugars?
You're psychic, Mrs H
It kind of looked like a smudge,
but there was definitely a figure.
And then, the other night
I was going to bed and...
My mum says it was a dream
but I saw this woman.
Here we are.
I should just explain,
my husband and I don't believe
in ghosts or spirits, Mr Lean.
No-one does, Mrs H, till
they experience one first hand.
Are you feeling one right now?
The house has a very strong aura.
No doubt about it.
Can I take a look around?
As long as you don't break anything.
Been cooking, have we?
Mm!
Yep. That's some psychotic pharmacy.
What?
It's a nasty red potion.
Takes a while to kick in.
Word of caution - be very careful
what you drink. Understood?
OK, that's it.
Upstairs, both of you.
Mum...! No!
I've heard enough. Upstairs!
He said we could watch!
We're leaving Mr Lean
to find his own way out.
Please let him do the cleansing.
He's not helping.
He's spooking us, that's all.
I'm sorry, Mr Lean. I can't have you
scaring the kids like that.
Is something wrong?
He's still here.
Who? It's not safe.
He wants to take over, take control.
You're not making any sense.
He was a painter. He died
on that fountain from the fall.
My God! Radcliffe.
Penny, go upstairs, please.
No, not Radcliffe.
His name was different.
Walker, I think.
I'll leave you this,
in case of anything untoward.
Basically, it's holy water
with a few add-ons. It's pukka.
OK. Goodbye, Mr Lean.
There's something else,
a feeling I picked up.
I've never quite...
You have to be careful.
What do you mean, careful?
He loved her, that's the problem.
He loved her too much and now...
he wants to take control.
Control of what? The house?
No, no. Not the house. Of you.
Goodbye, Mr Lean.
Penny, back in the house, please.
He said a painter lived here.
Radcliffe was a painter.
All that information is
on the internet for anyone to see.
These guys always do their research.
Go and hang with your brother.
I'll be up in a minute.
Wait. Where are you going?
I'm just going to check on Dad.
. I'll come with you. No.
Penny, your dad and I need
a bit of private time, OK?
Take this -
in case of anything untoward!
OK.
Metempsychosis.
"Metempsychotic pharmacy."
Jesus!
Charles Kendrick Walker.
I've always wondered
about this place.
Alec?
Alec?
What do you think?
What is this?
Jesus!
Different, huh?
I wanted to wait till
she was a little bit further along,
but I suppose now's as good a time
as any.
I could have done with a couple
more sessions with you.
I had to settle for sketching you
while you slept. Me?
Alec, this isn't me. Wait till
she's cast and finished. You'll see.
You're difficult to nail down.
Jesus!
What have you done to yourself?
It sounds crazy, but the blood
makes the clay easier to work.
The woman in Radcliffe's portrait.
His wife. Why are you sculpting
Radcliffe's wife?
What are you talking about?
It's exactly the same face,
the same position, everything.
Meg, it's supposed to be you.
Alec, he was a Rosicrucian.
He killed his wife in some ritual
in this house.
This job's pushed you over the edge.
You need to get back to therapy.
Our daughter is having a breakdown.
She believes she saw this woman
in her bedroom.
That was a nightmare.
You said so yourself.
I'm going back to London.
No. I'm taking the kids.
I'll run the job from there.
NO! I'm not going anywhere
and neither are you.
Don't you care about our daughter?
Of course I do, but I also care
about me for a change.
This is the best work
I've ever done. Probably ever!
I'm not about to give that up now.
This isn't your work, Alec.
What are you talking about?
You don't draw like this.
This is your stuff and I love it!
It's real.
This is not yours.
Get out!
Um...
First thing tomorrow,
after we've had a good sleep,
I'm going to have a family meeting.
I think I'm ready to...
go back to London
and work the build from there.
Really?
It's going to cost a lot more money,
but I think I can persuade Bradley
to step up.
Mum...we should leave now.
Your father's not ready
to leave yet.
And, um...
and I'm not leaving him here
on his own.
Harper?
Mum!
Harper?
Mum!
Harper?
Are you there?
Mum! Mum!
Harper?
Mum! Stop! Stop!
Harper, where are you?
Mum! Mum! Mum!
I hear you. I can't...
Mum? Mum!
Harper!
Mum! Mum! Get the door!
Harper, is that you? Are you there?
Answer me!
Shit!
For Christ's sake, Penny!
Where's Harper?
I think he's fallen into
the root cellar. The what?
OK, I'll find Dad.
No!
Harper, get back from the wall.
Get back from the wall!
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad? Dad?
Dad...?
Mum.
Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum.
Mum!
Mum!
God!
God! Oh, God!
God! Oh, God!
Where did you go?
Come on.
Did you see Dad?
No. I was down there when I woke up.
How do you think you got there?
It wasn't Dad. It was the ghost.
Shit. My keys are upstairs
in my bag. Please don't leave us.
Well, come with me, then.
No!
We can't sit here all night. You
need your inhaler. I'm going back.
Lock the door!
God!
What?
Penny?
Penny? Ssh.
It's OK. Ssh.
We're safe in here, OK?
We're going to die.
Ssh. It's OK. It's OK.
How are you feeling?
Where have you been, Alec?
I went for a walk on the moor.
To clear my head.
Are you sure you're feeling OK?
You're wearing a coat.
Are you leaving?
I thought I'd take the kids
to Grandpa's for a couple of days.
I'll come right back.
But we're getting so close.
I just think we all need a break.
Why don't we just talk about this...
..when I get back?
You can't abandon me.
There's so much to be done.
Why are you behaving like this?
Harper?
Penny? Where the fuck's the car?
Penny!
Harper?
Where's the fucking car?
Help me, somebody. Please.
Penny? Harper?
We need to talk. The kids have gone.
Someone's taken the car.
What kids?
Let go of me. Let go of me!
Isabella.
What are you doing in here?
It's nearly time.
We have to get ready.
What's happening to us, Alec?
Who's Alec? One of your lovers?
Stop it.
Stop it!
Keep away from me.
You're losing your fucking mind!
We made a secret pact.
You can't lose heart, Isabella.
Alec, I think Radcliffe's trying
to possess you.
You've got to fight him...
I love you more than life itself,
Bella.
Are you OK?
I think I peed.
When I say run, you run with me, OK?
OK? OK. One, two, three...
Run!
What now?
Why is there never any signal
in this stupid place?
OK, I think it's this way.
What if the ghost has killed Mum?
Stop thinking those thoughts.
YOU think those thoughts.
Well, I'm older than you.
What will we do if he has?
We'll get home and find Dad.
He'll know what to do.
What if the ghost has killed Dad?
We'll run away back to London.
OK.
We have to run, Harper.
Stay close to me, OK?
My gosh.
You! You there!
Harper!
Harper?
Harper!
Penny?
Harper?
Daddy! Daddy!
Dad?
Stop it, Dad.
Dad! ! Ow!
Dad! Let go! Dad!
No!
Dad! Let me out!
Dad! Dad!
Harper!
We need to get you out of there.
Harper, stand back from the window.
Are you OK? Yeah.
Dad's gone mad.
We've got to find Mum.
Have you seen her?
No.
Penny, he's changed.
He locked me in the room.
The ghost got inside him.
OK. Let's go.
Boy!
Mum.
Mum, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.
My head.
Mum, come with me. We have to hurry.
God, what's happening?
The window.
We can reach the fire escape
