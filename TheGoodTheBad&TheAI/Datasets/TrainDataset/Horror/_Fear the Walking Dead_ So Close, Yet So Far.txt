- I'm sorry! Sorry.
Chris, it's an emergency, man.
Call me right back.
- Recording:
-
Baby, call me back.
Call me back right away.
- Try the house.
- Yeah.
Man on radio:
in the officer-related shootings
in the last 48 hours.
Travis:
-
- Man #2:
We are losing the best
pocket passer in the league!
- Nick!
-
No one's talking about this.
No one's saying anything.
Travis: We need to get
away from the city.
We need to get away from people.
Just grab Alicia, Liza, Chris,
and just go until we know
what this thing is.
- The desert?
- Yeah.
It'll be okay there.
We'll be safe.
Alicia, where the hell are you?
- - Listen, we got Nick.
We're coming to get you.
I need you to pack some things for
us, load up some groceries, okay?
-
- We're going out of town.
-
- Why? What's wrong?
- Who? Who's sick?
-
His fever's, like, 103.
- What's wrong?
-
but it hurts when I touch him.
Don't-- don't touch him.
- I need you to call 9-1-1.
-
His parents are in Vegas.
They're not picking up.
Okay, we're coming to get you,
but just stay away from Matt
until we get there, okay?
-
- Mom?
Alicia. Alicia!
We're 10 minutes away.
-
-
- Really?
-
Alicia, move away from him.
What's wrong with you?
People are getting sick.
It could be contagious.
If he has it, I have it.
Alicia, can I talk
to him? Please?
Hey, Matt.
Where are your folks?
They should be home soon.
They're driving home today.
When did this start?
He was supposed to meet me
at the beach yesterday and...
never showed up.
Here we go.
Alicia, would--
would you?
Come on, come on.
What are you doing?
Is that a bite?
Matt:
Yeah.
- Is that how it happens?
- Travis:
I mean, Calvin was shot.
It wasn't-- wasn't like--
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna call 9-1-1
from the car.
- Okay, I'll wait for them here.
- No, go outside.
- Mom. What the hell are you doing?
- Don't do this.
- Are you psychotic? He's sick.
- Alicia.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You want some water?
Listen to me.
My parents will be home soon.
You know I'll be fine.
You know that.
No, I'm not leaving you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
That's why you gotta go.
Okay?
You gotta go.
Go.
Thank you.
-
- Man:
Man:
Cops shot some homeless dude.
Shot him, like, 20 times!
Alicia.
- Hey, Travis.
- You're having a party?
Yeah.
You should come by.
Gladys is nine. You believe that?
It's so scary.
- That's great.
-
We're getting a bunch of cancels
'cause of that bug going around.
So we'll see you.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
Peter's got the right idea.
Mom, are you gonna
tell her? Mrs. Cruz?
- Tell her what?
- What's happening.
Nick, we don't know
what's happening.
Well, we know more
than she does.
Okay, I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her.
It's just like no one
is paying attention.
It's-- it's like
it's not real.
It is.
It's real.
Hey.
You saved us.
You had no other choice.
I'm about to step into...
a world of shit.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
Travis:
No Liza, no Chris.
He's pushing my calls.
Did you try Liza at her house?
Of course I tried the house, Maddy.
Of course I did.
Okay, go.
Travis, go get them now.
-
-
Mrs. Cruz:
There goes another one.
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.
Mrs. Cruz: Well,
should I get the cake?
Call me if you're
gonna be longer.
If I'm longer, go without me.
- I'll catch up.
- No.
-
-
- A little busy, Trav.
-
What? No.
We agreed he was staying
with me this weekend.
Is Chris home from school?
- Did Nick go AWOL again?
-
Something's happened.
I'll explain when I get there, okay?
No, no, no.
You can't keep moving the goal-post.
Our settlement agreement
was very clear.
-
- It's clear, Travis. It is defined.
-
- You get him three weekends a month.
You can't just pick and choose.
Can you just please call him?
-
-
Liza:
Travis:
I'll see you next weekend.
Man: T.J., let's go, go.
Check it out.
Woman:
Madison: Alicia. Alicia.
We need the bucket.
Dr. Han.
Hi, it's Maddy Clark again.
Listen, uh, Nick is
really hurting right now,
and I just need you to call in the
prescription so I can pick it up,
but I'm really worried about him, and
I think he really, really needs it.
- Hang in there, big brother.
-
We're gonna get
your medicine, okay?
Alicia: Longer we leave
him, the worse he gets.
- I know. I'm aware.
- He won't be able to travel.
- Alicia.
- I gotta get under the blanket.
Mom, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Dr. Han's not calling me back,
and now I can't
even reach Travis.
Yeah, I mean, it's like
after an earthquake.
Circuits are overloaded.
- Got anything stashed?
- No.
Vicodin for my wisdom teeth.
I flushed 'em.
It's dangerous for him
to go cold turkey like this.
- I know. I know.
- Mom, I--
- It's okay.
- The doctor's. You can pick 'em up.
Mom.
I don't even know--
I think they're closed.
They're not calling me back.
By the time I--
Watch him.
- Prom-- do not leave the house.
- I wo-- I won't.
- Alicia, promise me.
- I'll look after him.
God damn it.
Woman:
Yo, Officer.
-
-
Was there an accident?
It'll clear up
past Sherman Oaks.
I don't even know
why I asked you.
Oh, my God!
- Hello, Miss C.
- Tobias.
Can I have my knife back?
-
-
-
-
Man:
Yo, this is wrong, man.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Back away, sir. Get on
with your business.
- This is his business. This is all our business.
- Officer:
That man never hurt a fly.
That man was unarmed.
-
-
Officer: We're gonna need
to clear this area now.
Man: Yo, we ain't
clearing nothing.
Officer:
Man #2: Yeah, and we're
all behind the tape.
Officer: I will not
tell you people again.
Man #2: Good, 'cause we
people aren't moving.
Hey, kid, put the camera down.
No, no, no, homie.
Keep that camera up.
I'm gonna give jackboot over
here a little civics lesson.
You wanna go to jail, son?
Jail? For what?
Freedom of speech?
Right to lawful assembly?
He ain't breaking any laws.
Man, he ain't
threatening nobody.
Oh, call your
little buddy, yeah.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Here.
Oh, can't do hot now.
I'll make gazpacho next time.
Yeah. It's gonna end
up in the bucket.
I'm not thirsty.
Water is not what I need.
Yeah, I know
what you need, Nick.
Mom's working on it.
It's her party, and she'll
cry if she wants to.
-
- I'll be fast.
No, no, no, no. Hey, you
can't go back there.
Hey! You promised Mom.
Alicia, come--
You make promises
all the time, Nick.
- Lie down!
- I'm an asshole. I'm an asshole.
Okay, but listen. Alicia, if you
leave, you won't come back.
You let Mom go.
Not safe. No, Matt!
Matt is not safe.
- Oh, Jesus... - No, Alicia, you don't get
what it makes people do.
- You don't know what I had to do, Alicia!
- What did you have to do?!
Matt will hurt you! He will
kill you, Alicia. I'm--
-
-
No, no, no, not now!
Not now!
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Not now!
Don't you do this,
you stupid son of a bitch!
Stay still.
Shh.
Why do I bother speaking?
Seriously,
why do I waste my breath?
- Is he here?
- You think I'm lying to you?
We gotta find him.
It's not safe.
This virus that's going around,
the shootings the past few
days, it's connected.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you see what happened
on the freeway last night?
I studied till 2:00,
passed out.
Well, people are getting sick.
They get sick,
and they get violent.
- And the cops shoot them.
- I've seen it.
You know what I've seen?
Nothing.
- It's getting worse.
-
-
-
Hey, just give me a second.
Hell, no! We won't go!
Hell, no!
We won't go!
- Mom! Mom!
- Travis:
Dad, why do you
have Mom's phone?
I'm with your mother. We're coming
to get you. Tell us where you are.
There's a protest.
I'm at a protest.
- A protest?
- Where is he?
- Where? -
Okay, let us come and get you.
Yeah, I get it.
I get it. Okay, but--
Dad, I'm part of it, okay?
I gotta go.
I gotta go, Dad.
I know where he is.
Cafeteria food's designed
to survive a nuclear strike.
Expires in, like, the year 3000.
What did you come back for?
Uh, Nick, my son,
is not feeling well.
Well, that's smart.
LAPD lockup,
they have pharmaceuticals.
Nick was here
when I was a freshman.
He seemed nice.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
Yeah.
Uh, the looters
hit pharmacies first,
then gun shops, liquor stores.
The less you go out, the
less chance you get exposed.
Hey, Miss C, have you
seen any of 'em yet?
I mean, I've only
seen 'em online.
No.
Let's hurry this up.
Mother lode.
Wow, you're stocking
up for a while.
It's gonna be a while.
So your mom's back, then?
My uncle's been around.
You should stock up,
too, Miss C.
No, we have food.
I'm sorry.
She should have been
back by now.
Yeah, I know.
Someone should have called...
by now.
Thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Cruz:
- I hate you.
-
I know.
-
-
Tobias: The desert will be safer
because things
will fall apart now.
No satellites, no Internet,
no cell phones.
Communications will fail 'cause no
one's there to manage the servers.
The electrical grid will
collapse for the same reason.
It's all gonna go to hell.
And that's what they don't get.
When civilization ends,
it ends fast.
They're gonna contain it.
The same "they"
that's supposed to warn us?
- Come on.
-
No, wait-- Miss C.
It's one of them.
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.
- Let's go.
-
Let's go. Go.
Oh, God.
Leave it.
Tobias, leave it.
Oh, God.
Okay, get the door.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Artie?
Artie.
-
- Oh, we-- we gotta go. We gotta go.
Artie, can you hear me?
He can't hear you.
You know he can't.
We'll get you help, Artie.
Artie, stop.
We're gonna get you help, okay?
We'll get you--
Tobias:
- No, stop!
- Tobias: No, no!
Madison:
- No, no, no, no! Ah!
-
Oh, no, no, no!
Help me!
Oh, no.
No, no!
-
-
- Chris!
- Chris!
Chris!
Liza:
Christopher James Manawa.
- We gotta go, man.
- Dad, he was unarmed, but they shot him.
No, they shot him
like a dozen times.
- Tell us on the way.
- No, I'm doing what you taught me.
Travis: I know, I know, but
there's a time and a place--
Chris: Right now. This
is happening right now.
Travis:
- Okay, we gotta go.
- This is important.
Come on, man.
You're important, okay?
Christopher,
listen to your father.
Christopher, now!
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you guys?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, wait, wait. Stop.
- Come on. Come on.
- This way.
-
-
Stop. Right now.
On the ground! On the ground!
Stop!
-
-
-
- Man: Get out! Get out!
-
- Man: Go! Go, man! Let's go!
- Where are we going?
- This way.
-
-
- Okay?
-
- Thing of beauty.
- Looks good, looks good.
Man:
Man #2: Man, what's
going on out here?
Take the side.
Take the side.
Go to your right.
Chris:
Excuse me, sir.
Can we come in, please?
We're closed.
Please, it's not safe out here.
I mean, it's dangerous.
Go to the police.
No, I think they're the danger.
I mean, they're not
letting anyone leave.
We just need somewhere
to ride it out.
Please. Please?
Please.
Okay, come in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-
-
Do you have a back door?
Access to the alley?
- There is no other door.
- Travis, please.
Woman:
-
- Liza: Travis, this is their home.
-
- Do you have access to the roof?
Travis, can you please
not go in there?
We can see what's coming there.
You will be fine in there.
I think it'll be safer if we
stay away from the front door.
No, I think you will
be safer in there.
Papa, I thought
you were locking up.
- Are you okay?
- We're fine.
- Who are you?
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm Travis.
This is my family.
We just need somewhere to ride
it out, and then we'll go.
-
-
It's okay, Papa. Please,
have a seat in there.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Just take a seat.
Thank you.
Woman on radio:
You can stay with us, Tobias,
until this is over.
This doesn't end.
There's room.
It's safe.
You gotta take care of your son.
I'll be okay.
You?
Yeah.
-
-
Thank you.
Thank my wife.
This is insane.
- Chris, get away from the window.
-
- Can't make anything out.
- You don't wanna see anything out there.
Okay? Just, come on, step away.
What do you know?
What have you seen?
- I've seen what people do.
-
What they don't do.
- It doesn't make sense.
-
They don't die, Liza.
They...
- ...come back.
-
All of us.
-
-
- Alicia: What took you so long?
- Shut the door.
How's your brother?
Never better.
He went grand mal on me.
I'm sorry.
- Travis call?
- No.
We ration those.
Oxy? Oxy's good.
How much?
It's enough to get us
to the desert.
And then what?
Hey.
She tried to leave.
Yeah.
I stopped her.
Alicia:
Can you give me a call?
I wanna know how you're doing.
No. No, God.
- Travis?
- Maddy. Maddy?
-
- You can hear me?
Yeah, no, we're good. I found Chris.
He's safe.
Yeah, we're okay.
Can you come home?
Well, where are you?
You're at Liza's?
No, no.
We're waiting in a shop.
I-- how's Nick?
Is he okay?
Did you find him the meds?
Uh, yeah.
Uh...
I got him enough,
you know, to wean him off.
I mean, to take him to the
desert and just wean him off.
-
- Oh, shit.
Madison: Wait, Travis,
what was that?
-
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
Go to the desert, now.
Don't wait.
No, I'm gonna wait for you.
I'm gonna wait for you.
Just go ahead. We'll catch up.
We'll find you, okay?
No, Travis,
just-- no--
-
- Whoa! Travis?
- Maddy?
-
Officer over P.A.
What the hell happened?
Mom?
Mom, are you okay?
Mom.
-
-
-
-
Dead again?
Phone lines
keep going off and on.
Power cuts out.
Tell me.
What's going on?
Oh, God.
-
- Oh, my God.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Mom, Mr. Dawson's
hurting them.
Get off!
No. Alicia!
-
- No.
What are you doing?
Mom. Mom!
