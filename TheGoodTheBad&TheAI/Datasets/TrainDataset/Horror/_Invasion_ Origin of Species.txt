You remember how to get there ?
Yep, route 27, 20 miles north.
Boca chica motel.
Yeah, the road's still blocked,
but I got you clearance.
I'll try to get up there
as soon as I can.
I won't count on it.
Hey, come on, it was my idea.
It's okay, honey.
Just find out what was inside that alligator,
and then come meet us when you can.
A little solo stepmother time
might be good for everybody.
Okay.
Hey, daddy, does the hotel
have a pool?
They got a big pool,
and they got cinnamon pancakes
the size of Jesse's head.
Oh, wow.
How come you're not goin'?
I got some work to do, but I'll try to meet up
with you guys tonight.
- Do you wanna drive?
- Yes.
Go for it.
All right.
When I get back, I want answers to all
the secrets of the universe.
Well, I'll try and have one.
- Take care of our baby.
- I will.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- You have fun, kids.
- Okay.
- Is this on tight?
- Seat belts?
- Okay.
- Bye, dad.
See ya later.
Dave, I'm goin' into work early.
Listen, I need you to promise me
you're not gonna say anything
about what we found until I...
Dave.
I hope you're all sittin' down
right now,
yours truly is going to be
answering all of your questions
That son of a bitch.
Okay, okay.
Okay, all right, easy.
Who the hell are you?
Ah. Okay.
No, don't.
Please, please, please.
Will you please just tell me what's going on here?
Your dream has come true, Dave.
You've been abducted.
You can't leave people in the dark.
Listen, if we don't get power back
in this town soon,
they're gonna burn my house down, Howard...
Don't let me down.
Good morning, Sir.
Ah, good morning to you,too, Lewis.
You're in early this morning.
- Yeah, a little work out.
- Good for you, Sir.
- And how's mrs. Underlay feeling today?
- Much better.
- Thanks for asking.
- Good.
Oh, I got an I.D. on that body we dredged up
the other night.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Brandi Marie Kotner.
resident of florida city.
That was very enterprising of you, Lewis.
I'm trying to figure out
what she was doin' in that cove, sir.
I believe  she was drowning.
But that's just it.
The coroner's report
says that she had sea water in her lungs,
- Not brackish.
- So?
So I'm thinkin' she died elsewhere,
and somebody moved the body.
You think she was murdered?
N-no, sir. There's no evidence of foul play.
Then why would someone move
a dead hurricane victim from one place to another?
- It's a puzzler, sir.
- Yes, it is,but then again...
Sir?
Hurricanes have been known
to move a lot of things.
I'll tell my wife you asked about her.
We're doing the right thing.
We're gonna have to go find someone else
if it's not him.
- Give me a little bit of time.
- No, no, no.
We need to find out if his blood test is...
I'll do my best. I need at least an hour.
An hour? I don't know if we have an hour.
His family's gonna start
lookin' for him very soon.
- We don't have all the materials.
- I'll give you as much time as I can.
Go ahead and do what you have to do.
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Thank you.
Who are you?
If you're offering that to me,
I'm not thirsty.
What does that mean?
Why won't you talk to me?
I just want you to talk to me.
I just need to know what's goin' on, that's all.
- Get up.
- Why?
We're moving.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You run now, you'll never know the truth.
What truth?
We've been readin' your blogs, Dave.
We understand you had an encounter with something
that may not be of this world.
Me, too.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Lookin' for my brother-in-law Dave Groves.
Oh, crazy Dave?
- Yeah. I guess he comes in here a lot.
-Yeah, he's not in here now.
- Was he in here this morning?
- Nope.
- What time are you guys open?
- Uh, 5 A.M.
And you're sure he wasn't in here this morning?
Positive, but you're the second person
in as many days that's asked about him.
Who was the first?
Uh, the Iraqi woman.
What Iraqi woman?
I don't know her name.
She's Iraqi...
or Arab or Persian or somethin'.
Been talkin' him up about some old naval yard
from the civil war.
- Cold war.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
I think she really wanted to take him up there.
He didn't seem that interested.
Did you know that our whole town
has been invaded by ebays?
Your scars look  lot different than mine.
- Mine are older.
- How old?
Two years.
Those things have been out in the water for two years?
Not here.
Why don't you sit down?
Don't worry, the tests are over.
Tests?
I'm sorry, Dave.
We had to find out
if you were really who you said you were.
Hold on, hold on,hold on.
- Are you sure you don't want some?
- Yeah, no, I mean...
Do you have any beer?
No. Please sit.
Why'd you take my blood?
Why'd you put me under water?
On one of your blogs,
you wrote about
a hurricane survivors' meeting in a local church.
Yeah. I went to a couple of 'em.
I scoped 'em out.
Why?
Well, because a lot of people in this town
have been actin' pretty weird since the hurricane.
- This guy that Russell was working with--
- Russell's your brother-in-law.
- How did you know that?
- You've written about him.
I know about your whole family.
- I didn't get your name.
- Healy.
- Healy.
- Right.
- Is that your real name?
- No.
Right. Not like I haven't asked you
this about 1,000 times,
but what the hell is going on here?
- We were hopin' you could tell us.
- You first.
- Who's that chick who was in the back of the room?
- You'll meet her.
- You always kidnap people off the net?
- No, and I'm sorry we had to do it this way,
- No, and I'm sorry we had to do it this way,
but based on your last message, we felt that
there was some urgency.
What was my last message?
"Hey, bloggers, it's me again, Dave.
"I'm on the verge of being able to report
"that the lights in the water
may contain human D.N.A.
"Oops. Guess I just reported it."
This alligator you found
with the partially digested alien in its belly,
that was from a dying part of the glades?
Yeah, Russell's not even certain
that it is an alien.
But again, I'm available via e-mail.
I didn't need in the middle of the night
and have my head shoved...
- into a vat of water.
- Pria !
We need you now.
Connie?
- You took this statement?
Sir, I just talked to the victim's parents.
What victim?
Brandi Marie Kotner...
the girl we pulled from the water
a couple nights ago.
Oh. I thought she didn't have any family.
The coroner thought so, too,
but I did a little research,
and apparently, she was adopted,
and though her adoptive parents have passed on,
her real parents, her birth parents
are still very much alive.
Lewis, why did you do this?
Because I felt so badly for what happened to her...
and to die in such a terrible way...
And have no one there for--
Well, I prayed on it last night, Sir.
You--you prayed on it?
I pray about a lot of things, Sir,
and like me, these people were curious
how sea water managed to get into
their daughter's lungs.
Your wife was confused about it, too.
You talked to Mariel?
Well, she was the one who originally
discovered the body.
Come here.
This is not a good thing you've done, Lewis.
Why not?
Because you've gone into people's lives--
perfectly happy people's lives--
and brought them tragedy.
- But, Sir, I--
- and on top of that,
you did it without talking to me.
How many jobs were available to you
after your tour of duty?
How many sheriff's departments
wanted to hire you?
None, Sir, only you.
And why do you think that is?
- I don't know.
- Because I knew you'd be loyal.
- I was counting on your loyalty, Lewis.
- And you have it, Sir...
but I'm loyal to someone else first.
Who?
God, Sir.
Give me the family's phone number,
and I'll talk to them.
- Thank you,Sir.
- Meantime...
You know that in let over on Biscayne
where the kids like to party?
One of the sugar companies
may be dumping out there again.
I want you to meet  me down there tonight.
- We'll see what we see.
- I'll be there, Sir.
Why did he call you Pria?
- Because that's my name.
- Your real name?
- No.
- No.
What is with you people?
We have to be careful, Dave.
- You should be, too.
- Oh, come on, come on.
You've been buggin' me around
that coffee shop for weeks now,
spinnin' me your stupid
little conspiracy theories,
tryin' to drag me out to some cock amamy naval yard.
I still need more time.
Time for what, huh?
- Who are you?
- We're survivors like you.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a survivor.
I spent the entire night of the hurricane
huddled in my sister's bathroom.
I never went near the water.
And I told your buddy here
that I only went to that church
- to check things out.
- And?
I don't know. They seemed
pretty normal to me...
but then I guess, you can't really trust anybody,
can you, Connie?
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.
As a matter of fact, I wanna leave.
That's what I'm gonna do.
I-if you leave now,
everyone you care about may die.
- Is that the truth you were talkin' about?
- Yes.
Then both of you need to stops
peakin' in Yoda right now...
and tell me everything you know,
or I'm outta here.
I think you should hang around.
How'd you find me?
I followed your mouth.
Who are you?
He says he's Healy.
She says her name's Pria,
- but yesterday, she was Connie, so...
- Put down the gun.
Also, he's got scars all over his body
just like Paxton
like the ones on my legs.
See if they're armed.
Okay.
All right. I think we're okay.
Sit down.
Why'd you bring him here?
We wanted a safe place where we could talk.
- They were readin' my blogs.
- We wanted to know who he was...
- and what he was.
- "What he was"?
Your brother-in-law has noticed
a lot of changes
in people around town lately, Russell.
Haven't you?
Your ex-wife, maybe?
Let us show you something.
It's Bonaire, off the coast of northern Venezuela.
Three years ago, fishermen caught in a hurricane
reported strange and beautiful lights landing in the water.
The next day, all the fishermen showed up on a beach--
naked--not a mark on 'em.
A week later, they all killed themselves.
That's La Isla de la Juventud,
The Isle of Youth, off Cuba.
One of Castro's nastiest prisons is there.
A year ago, on the heels of hurricane Charley,
the guards reported seeing "las luces" in the water.
Lights.
Shortly there after, the place imploded.
How?
After murdering half the prisoners,
all the guards committed suicide,
and none of this was made public, of course.
I only knew about it because
I was in Cuba at the time.
- Brazil?
- That's where we met.
That's enough.
Tell me what you know
- about my ex-wife.
- I think we already have.
You're saying she's gonna kill herself?
- I can't sit here any more.
- Sit back down.
You're treating us like hostages.
What the hell do you think you were doin' to him?
We don't have time for this.
There are people out there
who may be dying right now,
killing themselves and their children
because they can't reconcile what's happened to them.
Who are you?
I'm an archaeologist...
and you're keeping me from my work.
Pria and her husband...
they were in Brazil in 2004
when the first hurricane ever recorded down there
made landfall.
They were separated by the storm,
but they found each other two days later.
He was in remarkably good shape
considering what he'd been through,
but he wasn't the same man.
They'd gone deep into the forest on a dig
and taken their children with them,
and one night while they were asleep,
he snapped.
He doused himself with gasoline, set himself a blaze,
and he walked into their tent.
Pria lost her whole family that night.
How long after the hurricane did this happen?
Less than a week.
I'm sorry, but we just can't trust
anyone anymore.
See anything out there, Lewis?
Nothin' yet, sir.
What exactly are we looking for?
Any sign of chemical contaminants,
discoloration.
Sir?
I think I see somethin'.
Lewis?
Lewis!
Where is it?
It's in the back.
Let's go.
- Looks like a piece of fish.
- I wish it were.
- Those your kids?
-  Yeah.
You wanna see 'em again?
All you have to do
is tell us what this is.
I think you know more than I do.
If that were the case, we wouldn't be here.
What were you doin' in Cuba?
You military? C.I.A.?
Why do you keep lookin' in the mirror?
Something out there scare you?
Change.
I don't know what the hell that means.
A lot of people went missing in the hurricane,
but no one's committing suicide here.
In fact, many people, my ex-wife included,
seem to be--
adapting?
You're right, Russell.
Things are different here,
and that should concern you.
When an invasive species enters the park,
what do you do?
I study it.
And if it poses a threat?
You kill it.
You think that's what we're dealing with here,
an invasive species?
I don't know, but whatever it is,
the people affected here seem to be thriving.
They're goin' to church,
supporting each other,
developing a community.
So I gotta ask myself,
what is it about this place
that makes everything so different?
Now these things have been in the water everywhere,
but in Cuba and in Brazil,
most everyone's dead now.
So what is it about this place?
I don't know.
I think we owe it to your children to find out...
don't you?
What color?
I'm thinkin' maybe, like,
peachy kinda like.
Oh, yeah, I love that.
Yeah.
Morning, daddy.
Hey, hey.
- Honey.
- Hello.
What's the matter, eggs no good?
No. No, they're fine.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just thinkin' about stuff.
Lewis told me that he spoke with you.
Yeah. He mentioned that they found sea water
in that girl's lungs.
I told him that she could have drowned elsewhere.
That's possible, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
Is that what's bothering you?
You know me.
I always like to be thorough.
You can't save everybody.
You're only human.
See ya later, okay?
Okay.
- Lewis.
- Sir.
What are you doing here?
I mean, I...
How did you get to my house?
- I walked.
- You walked.
- Walked from where?
- The beach.
Come on in.
Come on.
Lewis...
do you know what happened to you last night?
- Not really, sir.
- Are you sure?
Yes, but I don't think
that really matters now.
Who am I to question a miracle?
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it a miracle, but...
Oh, it's a miracle, sir.
It's a miracle.
The human D.N.A. came
from blood, that was in this tentacle.
I think it acts like a feeding tube.
These are the suckers at the end here,
and this looks like a proboscis that could
- easily pierce the skin.
- Guys, I have to pee.
- Hold on.
- No, man, I can't.
I've been strapped in this chair all night.
Why does he get to walk around, and I don't?
- We'll take you outside in a minute.
- I can't wait that long.
Any trace of a digestive enzyme?
No.
I'm not sure this even leads to a stomach.
I mean, most of this is blubber, but right here...
this tissue is different.
It's muscular.
It's lined with a soft membrane.
It's similar to what you might find
in the inner lining of a uterus.
So it's a womb?
All right, if somebody doesn't come over
and let me out of this chair,
- I'm just gonna piss all over everybody.
- Shut up!
You shut up, man!
I gotta take a piss!
- What do you want me to do?
- You gotta be quiet.
What, is that--is that what you're afraid of?
Are you afraid somebody might hear me?
Are you afraid someone's gonna hear me yellin'
about how I'm gonna take a piss?!
Hey! Stop it!
I'll take him outside.
Unstoppable.
For two... and another two.
What could I possibly say to him, Tom?
It has to be a miracle, and if he wants
to tell the world about it, he should.
I'm left-handed.
- But who would believe him?
- The faithful.
No, they won't.
They'll think he's a freak.
Tom, every sunday
I stand behind my altar
and proclaim the mystery of faith,
a mystery that is at the very center of my beliefs--
death and resurrection.
It happened to me...
the night of the hurricane, I was dead,
but God chose to save me.
He's done the same for Lewis in a way
we could never possibly imagine.
But you're not hearing me, father.
I need you to tell this boy that
what happened to him is wrong,
that it goes against nature.
Believe me, it's in his best interests.
People are terrified of what they don't understand,
and they won't understand him.
Please, somebody call me on the double dribble.
They'll wanna dissect him.
Hell, they'll wanna dissect all of us,
and I cannot let that happen.
Perhaps he could be convinced
that this miracle is his and his alone...
A private communion with God.
Or...
as a test of his faith...
maybe a greater sacrifice is necessary.
Oh. You know, if you had've just
told me your name
in the first place, this would have been a little easier.
I couldn't.
We had to know who you were.
Ah. So if these things really are changing people,
is this, like, the end of the world?
I have no idea.
Oh, 'cause I, uh...
spent some time with Russ's ex recently,
and she seemed pretty good--
nicer than she used to be, actually.
So if this has happened to her,
I--it doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing,
does it?
I mean, just 'cause something is different,
doesn't necessarily make it bad.
It could still be good, right?
Well, it wasn't good for me.
Maybe Russel have the answer
Pria?
- Russell!
- What's wrong?
- She's been shot.
- What?
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Stay here!
We gotta get her to a hospital.
- I'm all right.
- No, you're not.
Please. It's too far.
Pria.
I have to show you something.
It--it's amazing.
I got so used to the one,
that having two just feels so...
abundant.
I am truly blessed.
We all are, Lewis.
Are you sure there are poachers living here?
It looks abandoned.
You never know,
and even if there aren't...
it's nice to be so close to the water, isn't it?
- It feels good.
- Actually, it does.
Water saved my life.
- The plane crash, sir?
- Yeah.
That was a nightmare, Lewis,
but I lived through it.
I survived.
Not that everyone was happy
about that, mind you.
- What do you mean, sir?
- Well, a lot of people resented me...
thought I was a...
I don't know, a freak or somethin'.
The first years, they were the toughest.
My "miracle" brought the people
around me a lot of grief.
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
But maybe my experience...
could spare you the same fate.
People don't like different, Lewis.
Sir.
It won't be good for you.
It won't.
When you were in the hospital,
you posted a blog about a skeleton
you found in the water near everglades city.
Yeah.
You said it was in the trunk of your car.
It was you.You took it.
It looks like the person was killed
by one of these creatures from the water.
It's almost 10 years old, which would make it
the first we know of.
I've been reconstructing the skull.
It's back there.
Pria!
- You see who did this?
- No...
but if they know we're here,
they'll be back.
- Who?
- Who are you talk--
who's after you?
- Who do you think?
- Where are you going?
- We'll be in touch.
- Russ. Russ!
Dave, we gotta go.
We gotta get outta here.
No, come here. Come here.
You gotta see this.
She's given it a face.
This isn't God's plan, Sir.
- How do you know?
- Because he gave me a gift.
That's right, Lewis.
- So why do you wanna go against him?
- Go against him?
He took your arm for a reason, son,
to challenge you.
It defines who you are now.
Wasn't that his plan?
Yeah.
I don't know what to do, sir.
I don't know what to do.
Listen. Listen.
Then do what's right.
Okay?
