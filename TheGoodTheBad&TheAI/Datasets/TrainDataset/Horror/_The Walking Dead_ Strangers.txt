Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...
We're friends with the chick with the sword
and the kid with the hat.
They attacked us.
I don't believe you.
- Who the hell are these people?
- They ain't people.
We fight to the fence!
You have to go with me.
- We need to go.
- Go where?
Somewhere far away from there.
Not so fast.
You didn't want to be there.
That's why I tried
to talk to you.
Glenn told me
you saved his life.
He saved mine.
That's how it works
with us, right?
Right.
Hey.
Get something to eat.
We'll start back at sunup.
Talked to Rick.
Some of them know what you did
at the prison.
Daryl, Maggie.
They accept it.
You wouldn't be here
if they didn't.
Gonna talk to the rest of them.
Tell them to accept it, too.
They don't have to.
No, they do.
They just do.
We don't need to tell them
about the girls.
I don't want to.
Why?
I just need to forget it.
I got it.
Right there is why we're
waiting for our moment.
Yeah, fair enough.
I owe you everything.
You owe Tyreese.
He was at the prison.
You got back there.
It was in one
of their storerooms.
I saw them kill him.
That kid.
Mm-mmm.
I still don't know
about what you did...
but I know you knew
some things I didn't.
I sent you away to this--
You said I could survive.
You were right.
I sent you away to this
and now we're joining you.
Will you have us?
Thank you.
I don't want to talk about it.
I can't.
I just need to forget it.
All right.
It's nothing.
We surrender.
No tracks.
No nothing.
So whatever you heard
last night...
It's more what I felt.
If someone was watching us,
there would have been something.
Keep close.
Ready to get some concrete
under your feet?
I think it's time.
That is sweet music
to my ears, Officer.
Take the next road we come to,
try to get back to going north
till we find a vehicle.
- Good?
- Good.
Tighten it up.
Uh, wet socks.
Cool feet.
Mosquito bites.
Itching reminds you
you're alive.
Danger around every corner.
Never a dull moment.
The hot sun beating down on you.
Come on, a glorious tan.
I said it and I meant it.
No privacy.
Captive audience.
One more.
One more.
He's a damn expert at that.
- What was it?
- A little game.
Good out of the bad.
-
- Dad, come on.
Come on!
- Come on.
-
Anybody, help!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Whoa! Whoa!
We're clear.
Keep watch.
You okay?
Sorry.
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm Gabriel.
Do you have any weapons on you?
Do I look like
I would have any weapons?
We don't give two short and
curlies what it looks like.
I have no weapons of any kind.
The word of God is the
only protection I need.
Sure didn't look like it.
I called for help.
Help came.
Do you have--
have any food?
Whatever I--
I had left,
it just hit the ground.
We've got some pecans.
Thank you.
That's a beautiful child.
- Do you have a camp?
- No. Do you?
I have a church.
Hold your hands above your head.
How many walkers
have you killed?
Not any, actually.
Turn around.
How many people have you killed?
None.
Why?
Because the Lord
abhors violence.
What have you done?
We've all done something.
I'm a sinner.
I sin almost every day.
But those sins,
I confess them to God,
not strangers.
You said you had a church?
Hey, earlier,
were you watching us?
I keep to myself.
Nowadays, people
are just as dangerous
as the dead, don't you think?
No, people are worse.
Well, I
wasn't watching you.
I haven't been beyond
the stream near my church
more than a few times
since it all started.
That was the furthest
I've gone before today.
Or maybe I'm lying.
Maybe I'm lying about everything and
there's no church ahead at all.
Maybe I'm leading you into a trap
so I can steal all your squirrels.
Members of my flock
had often told me
that my sense of humor
leaves much to be desired.
Yeah, it does.
Hold up.
Can we take a look around first?
We just want to hold on
to our squirrels.
I spent months here without
stepping out the front door.
If you found someone inside,
well, it would have
been surprising.
Thanks for this.
We found a short bus out back.
It don't run, but I bet we could fix
that in less than a day or two.
Father here says
he doesn't want it.
Looks like we found
ourselves some transport.
You understand what's
at stake here, right?
Yes, I do.
Now that we can
take a breath--
We take a breath, we slow down,
shit inevitably goes down.
We need supplies
no matter what we do next.
That's right.
Water, food, ammunition.
Short bus ain't going nowhere.
Bring you back some baked beans.
One way or another,
we're doing what Rick does.
We're not splitting up again.
What he said.
We want to roll with you, but...
what she said.
How'd you survive
here for so long?
Where did your supplies
come from?
Luck.
Our annual canned food drive.
Things fell apart
right after we finished it.
It was just me.
Come here, Judith.
The food lasted a long time.
And then I started scavenging.
I've cleaned out
every place nearby.
Except for one.
What kept you from it?
It's overrun.
How many?
A dozen or so.
Maybe more.
We can handle a dozen.
Bob and I will go with you.
Tyreese should stay here,
help keep Judith safe.
That'll be okay?
Sure.
You ever need me to watch her,
need anything for her,
I'm right here.
I'm grateful for it.
And everything else.
- I'll draw you a map.
- You don't need to.
You're coming with us.
I'm not gonna be of any help.
You saw me.
I'm no good around those things.
You're coming with us.
Listen, I don't trust this guy.
Why?
Why do you trust him?
Everybody can't be bad.
Well...
I don't trust this guy.
And that's why
I'm bringing him with me.
But he could have friends.
So I need you to stay alert
and help Tyreese
protect Judith, okay?
Now...
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.
Okay.
You are not safe.
No matter how many
people are around
or how clear the area looks,
no matter what anyone says,
no matter what you think,
you are not safe.
It only takes one second.
One second and it's over.
Never let your guard down, ever.
I want you to promise me.
- I promise.
- Okay.
Dad.
You're right.
I am strong.
We both are.
But we're strong enough
that we can still help people.
And we can handle ourselves
if things go wrong.
And we're strong enough
that we don't have to be afraid
and we don't have to hide.
Well, he's hiding something.
I'll stay safe, Dad.
Yeah.
Hey.
When you said
they don't get to live,
you weren't wrong.
We push ourselves
and let things go.
Then we let some more
go and some more.
And pretty soon, there's
things we can't get back.
Things we couldn't hold
on to even if we tried.
Washington's gonna happen, Rick.
I haven't decided
if we're going.
Yeah, I know, and that's cool.
But you've seen
Abraham in action.
He's gonna get there and
Eugene's gonna cure all this
and you're gonna find yourself in a place
where it's like how it used to be.
And if you've let
too much go along the way,
that's not gonna work.
'Cause you gonna be back
in the real world.
This is the real world, Bob.
Naw.
This is a nightmare,
and nightmares end.
I'm sorry.
I'm calling it.
Washington's gonna happen.
You're gonna say yes.
Already too much momentum.
You can't fight city hall.
Maybe that's just one of those
parts of not letting go.
Hey, I get it.
You don't want to talk about it.
You okay?
Gotta be.
We get to start over.
All of us with each other.
You saved us all by yourself.
We got lucky.
We all should be dead.
I'll check it.
Hey.
We ain't dead.
And whatever happened, happened.
Let's start over.
- I want to.
- Well, you can.
We should leave this
here for backup
in case things go south
at the church.
Want me to carry one of those?
No.
You know, I didn't want
to mention anything
when we looked this place up
in the phone book,
but I just can't imagine a gun
store having leftovers nowadays.
Don't look good, does it?
Was it a walker?
Uh, yeah.
It was a walker.
Really?
It was a stack of boxes
and a mop and I tripped.
Still...
got what we came for.
You actually found something?
Three silencers stashed
in a mini-fridge.
Rule number one
of scavenging--
there's nothing left in this
world that isn't hidden.
We're here.
This was the food bank.
It served the whole county.
All the cans at my church
were gonna end up here.
If a sewer could puke,
this is what it'd smell like.
The water's been coming down
that hole for a while.
We can use the
shelves to block them.
Yeah, that's it, Sasha.
There's our way.
Down those shelves.
Hey.
I said you're coming with us.
Go! Go!
Here they come.
You take right.
We have to get Gabriel.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
All right, we'll push down the
shelves on the ones in front of us.
We'll fight through
and I'll grab him.
Yeah.
I know which way
it's gonna break.
Bob!
You okay?
Bob, you okay?
I'm fine now.
I'm sorry.
I-- I panicked.
- I told you I--
- You knew her when she was alive?
Yeah, I get it.
You only tell your sins to God.
Do you miss the sword?
Wasn't really mine
in the first place.
Found it in the very beginning.
How'd you get so good?
It was just me and them out here
all day, every day
a good long time.
I don't know what that
was, but it wasn't a life.
Not like today.
Stumbling around
in three feet of slime
for some peas and
carrots, that's living.
I miss Andrea.
I miss Hershel.
- Yeah.
- I don't miss what was before.
I don't miss that sword.
Hey.
Tyreese said you were out back.
Come on in.
We found food.
- A lot of it.
- Good.
What is it?
Those scratches.
They're deep.
Like knives or something.
I found something else.
I don't know what happened,
but whatever it is,
we can handle it.
Doesn't mean Gabriel
is a bad guy for sure,
but it means something.
Ooh, give me-- ah.
I'd like to propose a toast.
I look around this room...
and I see survivors.
- To the survivors.
- Survivors! Cheers!
Is that all you want to be?
forage for food, go to sleep
at night with two eyes open,
rinse and repeat?
I mean, you got the strength.
You got the skill.
Now, we get Eugene to Washington
and he will make the dead die
and the living will have
this world again.
And that is not a bad takeaway
for a little road trip.
Shh.
Eugene, what's in DC?
Infrastructure constructed
to withstand pandemics
even of this fubar magnitude.
That means food, fuel, refuge.
Restart.
However this plays out,
however long it takes for the
reset button to kick in,
you can be safe there.
Safer than you've been
since this whole thing started.
Save the world
for that little one.
What was that?
- - I think she knows what I'm about to say.
She's in.
If she's in, I'm in.
We're in.
Okay.
I'm not letting my brother be the
only one that gets to hold that baby.
Wait.
One more.
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I was at the prison.
With the Governor.
I didn't know who he was
or what he could do.
And I didn't know
who all of you were.
I-- I just didn't
want it to be hidden.
That I was there.
You're here with us now.
Thanks for the hospitality.
I'm surprised you let us
drink your communion wine.
There isn't anyone left
to take communion.
The wine's just wine
until it's blessed.
You're hiding something.
And it's pretty obvious it's
something you can't hide from.
That's your business.
But these people,
these people e my family.
And if what you're hiding
somehow hurts them
in any way, I'll kill you.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
They got Beth.
Come on.
Come on, get in.
You waking up?
Ah, you're back with us, huh?
Good news is...
you're not dead yet.
That's a relief, right?
But try not to read too much
into the word yet there.
It'll just drive you crazy, Bob.
I want to explain
myself a little.
You see, we didn't
want to hurt you...
before.
We didn't want to pull you away
from your group or scare you.
These aren't things
that we want to do.
They're things we got to do.
You and your people
took away our home.
I said it.
Can't go back, Bob.
I just hope you understand
that nothing happening
to you now is personal.
Yeah, you put us
in this situation
and it is almost
kind of a cosmic justice
for it to be you, but...
we would have done this
to anybody.
We will.
But at the end of the day,
no matter how much we hate
all this ugly business...
a man's got to eat.
If it makes you feel
any better...
you taste much better
than we thought you would.
