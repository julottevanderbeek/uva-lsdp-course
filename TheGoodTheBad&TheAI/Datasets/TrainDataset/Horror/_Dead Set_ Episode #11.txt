'2.36pm.
'Space is in the Biodome.
'Marky and Veronica are by the pool.
'Joplin and Pippa are at the sofas.'
I mean, you know,
what is TV, anyway?
It's just a big fat arrow
pointing away from the problem.
Especially shows like this.
It's like the lead in the water pipes
that sent the Romans mad.
Mmm.
I thought to myself,
"OK, I can ignore it,
"or I can engage with
and alter it from within."
You know, and if just one person
hears me and thinks, "Wow.
"l never saw it like that.
This guy's really opened my head,"
then I've justified doing it.
You know?
Do toes have bones in them?
'Grayson and Angel
are in the diary room.'
-  Hello, Grayson.
- Hi, Big Brother.
- Hello, Angel. How are you today?
- All right.
I'm pissed off and I'm angry,
and we need your permission
to kill someone.
Who would you like to kill?
- Who do you think? Wonderbra.
- And her spastic henchman.
All right, so show me M and V looking
really pleased with themselves, OK?
The chawier the better.
And lose "spastic", otherwise Ofcom
will be shitting blood for a week.
VIDEO REWINDING
- Who do you think? Wonderbra.
- And her henchman.
Good.
And last night,
you could hear everything.
It sounded like someone
spanking a wet rat!
And who needs to hear that?
They even sound thick
when they grunt.
OK, so mark that for their best bits.
Patrick.
- Thanks...uh, what is it?
- Kelly.
- That's the one.
- They only had blueberry muffins.
- Oi, oi, oi. Fat camp!
- Oh, that's lovely.

- Well, what did you say?
I crashed at yours.
OK. Glossed over
a couple of details, then.
Yeah, me and Riq
have been together for ages.
It's not my usual style, you know?
You got pissed,
you put your hand in the cookie jar.
You make it sound so innocent.
LAUGHING
Yeah, but was it?
Here you are...
I will be back later
for the highlights, you jammy cow.
Hiya. That's your coffee.
- Heya.
- Hey.
Listen, what happened last night
was a mistake.
- Yeah, it was...
- We must be really stupid
cos we kept repeating
the same mistake till, what, half three?
Yeah, thereabouts.
Yeah, cos I like to learn
from my mistakes
and I don't think
we fully went through
all the possible avenues for error, so...
Dick!
I'd like to go over it
with you later, see if we can...

Uh, Sophie.
Uh, she's picking up Pippa's mum.
Oh, fucking hell! She should have
been here by 5.00. Get her for me.
- Sorry.
- What's the latest?
Um, numbers are way down.
There are network issues or something.
- OK, so the headline is...?
- Well, Grayson is safe.
Marky is the favourite for the chop,

Fucking get back here, pronto!
No.
Pick that up.
Your boss isn't upset, I hope.
It's eviction night,

It's a very stressful
line of work. I've often thought that.
What's that?
SQUELCHING, MUNCHING
Right. Shit. Bye. Fuck.
- Claire.
- Yeah?
They might bump tonight's show.
- Why?
- Because of this shit.
One fucking estate on fire
in Newcastle
and a couple of policemen
killed in Liverpool.
Oh, Jesus.
Stockwell, Cardiff, Portsmouth,
all bollocksed.
If this gets much worse, we are
gonna be bumped for a news update.
Brilliant.
Why do people riot,
anyway? It's not the '80s.
You know, they've got distractions.
They should stay in, watch telly.
Just...that hat is so loud.

I'm just not feeling this no more.
Too many arguments.
No, what are you doing?
Don't put that shit in there!

I didn't know what your question was,
cos you kinda stuttered it. "Are you..."?
He said to me, "Oh, how do you feel
about your country?"

Yeah, well, not unless this really is
the end of the world, which...
Right.
OK, well, I'll keep
my fingers crossed, then.
Yeah, and you break
one of those rather lovely legs.
'All right. Bye-bye.'

- I don't know.
You never spook... You never
spook the talent, alright?
Even if there is a mushroom cloud
about to go off behind them,
especially if they're
about to go live, OK?
- It is page one stuff, Claire.
- I didn't tell her!
Davina will start talking.
