Bestyou can do
ishope they fuck up...
and do what you can

And then blame yourself
for the killings ?
Oh, no. I blame
the asshole who did them.
This man´s whole life
is about killing.
He studies it.
He knows forensics.
He understands

That night,

Oh... this is good.
Shall we dance ?
No, don´t play

This will be fun.
Shh.
Shh. It´s over.
It´s all right.

Joel.
Why didyou turn

Why wasitso hard

´Cause you know
I did it foryou.
You came so close to me
that night.
IremembercIearIy what IfeIt
when Iheardyourfootsteps

-
- Pride.
I thought it would keep us
together forever.
For me,
it was our finest moment.
I can still see the flames.
Oh !
Shit.
What the fuck ?
Oh, fuck !
Ididn ´tsee anything.
Wanda, you wanna run
that in to Sarge ?
Right on it.
Hey, I´m Detective Mackie.
Welcome to my crime scene.
Can I help you find anything ?
I´m just going home.
I live upstairs.
Did you not happen to notice
that yellow police tape
marked ''Do Not Cross'' ?
Ifyou´re done with that, I´ll just
take it and go home.
Do you know this woman ?
I´ve never seen her.
What happened ?
Is she dead ?
Oh, I haven´t made
any reference to homicide.
Why would you hasten
to such a conclusion ?
Well, you got halfthe block
taped off, and you got what,
about a dozen cops in there,
fuckin´ up your crime scene ?
Itjust doesn´t seem like
someone boosting stereos to me.
Lookhere. Give me a caII
ifyou think ofanything.
All right ?
Hello. Yeah,
this is Hollis.
Hello.
This is Campbell.
I´m the guy--
We met last night.
Yeah,Joel Campbell.
Our ex-F.B.I. friend
from apartment 805.
We did a little checking on you
afteryou afteryou left.
What can I do foryou ?
I can hardly-- Are you busy ?
It sounds like you´re in
the middle ofsomething.
Yeah, some geniusjacked
a Honda a couple blocks ago.
That´s an ´86.
- What, do you want me
to call you back ?
- No.
When did she die,
the girl ?
Monday night.
Three days ago. Why ?
´Cause I know who did it.
And how might you
know that ?
He mailed me a picture
of her still alive.
I got it three days ago--
Monday morning.
HoIdon a minute, CampbeII.
Teen hoodis on the run.
Okay.
Sorry to keep you.
Now... you wanna meet me
back at my office ? All right.
Is ityourcustom
to openyourmaiI
fourdaysafteryouget it ?
Nope. Sometimes
it takes up to two weeks.
Well,
this would appear...
to answer any questions
we had whether these
two cases were related.
Goodness gracious.
Nothin´ like
a good serial killing
to kick offthe holiday season.
Right in here.
Gimme a minute
in that room.
Okay, Lieutenant.
We got him sending
his pictures in the mail.
Campbell, hell,
we oughta get Bob Barker
in on this son ofa bitch.
It´s a damn game show.
His last alias was
David Allen Griffin.
I worked the case
for three and a halfyears
in Los Angeles.
We attributed at least
- What´s he doing in Chicago ?
- I assume he´s still strangling
young women with piano wire.
All the victims were left
partially unclothed, and all
the swabs came back negative.
ExactIy.
No touchy, no feeIy.
Have you ever seen
this guy ?
No. No one´s
ever seen him.
Well, then we can´t necessarily
conclude it´s the same fella,
can we ?
Come on. He sent me
fuckin´ pictures.
Shoved the vic right up my ass
in my own fucking building.
- Sorry.
- It´s quite all right.
You looked adorable.
This film stock says
it´s for exterior sunshine,
but... how does it handle
in fluorescence ?
Uh, I´m sorry.
I have no idea
what you´re talking about.
I just work here.
- You do film processing here.
- Uh, yeah, one hour.
- Do you mind ?
- Sure.
- What are you doing ?
- I´m going to test it out.
I´m gonna shoot some pictures,
and you´re going to
process them for me.
Perfect.
Yeah, chiefofChicago P.D.
aIreadycaIIed.
Not surprising,
I suppose, they´re
inviting us in on this.
They´resetting up
ajoint task force
as we speak.
I´d like to know ifyou think
you can handle it on our end.
I know that in L.A.--
Oh, no, this isn´t L.A.
It´s not myjob anymore.
You know what ?
The onIy reason thatyour
burnt-out, messed-up ass...
is standing in my office
is because you had
a three-year head start on us.
Thisperp isset onputtingyou
in the middIe ofthis shit
whether we Iike it ornot.
You´re right.
The field office in L.A.
has the relevant files.
I can´t tell you anything
that´s not in them.
I´m sorry.
Mike. Excuse me.
Mike, we got several sets
of prints offthe FedEx envelope
and the photo itself.
I´m sorry. This isnone of
mybusiness, but, uh,
you can run the prints.
You´re gonna get me,
the driver, three guys
from the warehouse,
Santa Claus...
a whole bunch ofelves.
Definitely not this guy.
Who the hell is that ?
Run it.
Yes, sir.
Ooh-ooh
Can´t anybodysee
Well, you´re young.
Do you plan to live on
disability your whole life ?
I take 200 milligrams
ofSeconal just so I can sleep
two and a half hours a night.
Twice a day, I take
and 20 milligrams of Lotensen
for high blood pressure.
I self-inject migraine medicine
whenever the fuck I please.
They don´t...
mix well with work.
Hmm.
Maybe you´rejust afraid.
Fuckin´ right.
I am afraid.
Okay.
Let´s talk about that.
I go places,
and I forget why I´m there.
I miss exits
on the freeway.
I´m lucky to...
find my way home
from the grocery store.
And if I do, then...
most ofthe time
I´ve forgotten my groceries.
But yet, you make it
here every week.
Twice a week.
Yeah.
You do.
What ifthe next picture
that arrived was of
your daughter ?
Would you really want me
to be the one looking for her ?
Yes.
Yes... I would.
From thismoment
Howcan it feeI
This wrong
Hello.
Hi. It´s me.
Me ?
Me who ?
It´s freaking cold here.
Why´d you move here ?
What the fuck
do you want from me ?
You hardly leave your apartment.
And when you do, it´s to eat...
at that same terrible
Vietnamese restaurant
night after night.
You seem so bored.
I was expecting
a warmer welcome.
I didn´t fuckin´
askyou here, did I ?
The guy they
replaced you with--
I tried to make it work,
but wejust didn´t see
eye to eye at all.
I was going to quit the game
entirely, but then I thought,
''Chicago´s not so bad.''
At Ieastyou didn ´t move
to NewJersey, right ?
Yeah.
So, why don´t you
grab a pen ?
I´ll give you the name
and number ofthe...
agent that´s on your case.
You can... share your
inner turmoil with him
´cause I don´t give a shit.
I know yourjob
is hard,Joel,
so I´m willing to take steps
to try and make things work
between us.
- What are you talking about ?
- The photos,Joel.
I´ll send you a picture,
and you can have a day
to try to find her.
I´ll give you till 9:00.
What do you say,Joel ?
I say I should have moved
to NewJersey, asshole.
Good night,Joel.
Are you all right ?
I think so.
Shit !
Who is it ?
FIowers

You didn ´t answerthephone.
The doordownstairs was open,

Put the flowers
on the floor.
Thankyou.
Thephotos,JoeI.
I´IIsendyou apicture,

No, I´ve neverseen her.
Is she dead?
Ihaven´t made any reference

Areyoujust afraid ?
Fuckin´right.
Iam afraid.

Yes.
I´IIsendyou apicture.
You can have a day

I got this a half hour ago.
I want the case.
Can you handle it ?
I guess we´ll find out.
What else did this asshole say
last night ?
That´s everything.
We already have
a trap and trace on that line
and on your cell phone.
What is that ?
What is that, a bird ?
This is a poster.
Looks like it was shot inside.
Could be taken anywhere.
It was processed
commercially.
See ifthese numbers
are traceable. If not,
get me a list...
ofevery place in the city
that prints on this Kodak paper.
You got it.
Is that mine ?
Thanks.
I´m sorry. I can´t
rememberyour name.
Mitch Casper.
Mitch, get this
in the computer
and blow it up.
Find out what´s behind
her on the wall.
That thing right there.
Find out what kind
ofearrings she´s wearing,
what kind of blouse that is.
- What´s that on her glasses ?
- Reflection, yeah.
Find out something
about her. Anything.
BothgirIsare basicaIIy Ioners,
veryIittIesociaIcontact.
The last girl´s parents
were deceased.
No close friends
as far as we can tell.
Is that his victim profile ?
No. I mean, the victims
were always young women,
but he´s sending
pictures now.
He´s only gonna target loners.
You know, women
people don´t notice.
He´s not gonna send me
a picture ofthe prom queen.
Yeah. Well, listen.
Before we go any further,
we´re gonna have to make
a decision as to whether
to go to the press with this.
We gotta make it now.
Look. There´s no decision
to make. There is shit else
we can do for this woman.
Let´s get him
in front ofthe cameras.
They´re gonna like him.
AIIIcan teIIyou
at this time is that...
AIIIcan teIIyou
at this time is that...
we have substantial reason
to believe this woman´s life
is in serious danger.
The Chicago Police Department
and the F.B.I. are working
in concert...
to try and locate her,
and we´re gonna be grateful
for any help...
you guys can give us
in this endeavor.
Every hour is critical.
That´s all.
This young woman is missing.
Authorities are frantically
searching for her.
They fear for her safety.

or the identity ofthe woman...

What are you
bitching about ?
Oh, come on, Diana.
This was my case.
Ibby opens the door and in
flies ''Captain Barbiturate.''
You know, I don´t care
how well he knows
this creep.
I say if his pupils
don´t dilate,
then we don´t need him.
Ma ´am, there-- There hasn ´t
been a reward estabIished,
but I´m sure something
can be done.
Okay. Today ?
Was that today ?
Okay, thankyou.
We´ll check it out.
- Anything yet ?
- Eighty-five, ninety calls
in the last fifteen minutes.
I mean, lots of ''maybes''
and ''possibles.''
We´re trying to sift
through the shit,
but there´s a lot of it.
Despite a massivesearch
thisafternoon,
poIicestiIIhave not Iocated

Theycontinue

Mitch.
What is that ?
A sign ?
Uh-huh.

I´ll enhance the drum scan.
We´ll bring it even closer,
and we´ll see what we got.
All right ?
Fuck.
Yeah.
The numbers

- The list is on its way.
EIeven hundredIocations.
Eleven hun-- What ?
Do you know where there´s
a Lou Mitchell´s restaurant
on Oak Street ?
Yeah, it´s in
the GoId Coast area.
We´ll take it. Let´s run.
Yep, I´mprettysure
that washer.
She was wearing a headband.
Was she alone
or eating with someone ?
Uh, she was alone.
When was the last time
you saw her ?
I don´t know.
Sometime last week.
Can you be more specific ?
What day ?
No. Not without
making shit up.
We don´t want you to do that.
I want every employee that
worked here in the last week...
in the restaurant
within the hour--
managers, cooks,
dishwashers, cashiers.
That´s gonna be hard.
Life is hard.
Pull every credit card sale
for the week.
Eliminate men, married women,
anyone over 40. We need to
call every one ofthem.
Got it.
I gotta be on the phone.
See ifwe can get some help.
Okay.
Can you spare anyone ?
I´ll get you
all the help you want.
Good. We´ll fax them
a list of names. They need
to start making calls.
I´m on it.
Okay. Thankyou verymuch.
Authoritiesare hoping

for Christ´s sake.
Ifthey´re not home,

They´re getting home
from work.
Excuse me.
Check this out.
You were right.
It´s definitely...
''A-P'' and the line
is an exclamation point.
Does that mean
anything to you ?
Add a ''C-R'' to it,
it spells ''Crap.''
No. What do you
want me to say ?
Yeah, that´s true.
It spells ''Crap.''
One ofyour waitresses
saw her here
sometime last week.
Look at the picture
carefully and tell me
ifyou remember her.
Sorry, man. I make it a point
to pay as little attention
to the customers as possible.
- Does it seem like
playtime to you ?
- No.
Take a look at
the fucking picture
and tell me ifyou saw her.
- I never saw her.
- You sure ?
Yeah.
That´s too bad.
Thankyou for coming in.
Come on, darling.
Click on your television set.
It´s Thursday night, goddamn it.
''Must-see TV.''
Earlier today, we told you
investigators were combing
the streets of Chicago...
searching for this woman--
a woman they are...
referring to as 'Jane Doe. ''
Put up the fuckin´ number.
Let´s go. Come on.
They are still in need
ofyour help.
- Come on ! Don´t take--
- The city council approves
a new budget.
Ifthat´s all the help they´re
gonna give us-- What was the
time ofdeath on the other two ?
- What ?
- 9:00.
It´s done.
We´re notgonna make it.
We´re not gonna make it.
Okay. Good night, Ellie.
See you tomorrow.
That was it.
Third possible sighting

Grab some backup.
You wanna come with ?
You know me,
your hat´s on backwards.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
Guys, Iook.
She´s been sighted here on
three separate occasions, okay ?
Everybody we see
walking around here
is a possible witness.
So, I want you to fan out.
I don´t know ifshe works here,
ifshe lives nearby.
Take these fliers.
Get them to everybody
in the place.
I wanna show ´em, okay ?
You guys come with me.
Who spoke to

Speak to the gentleman

Take a look at that ?
Thankyou.
Ifyou see her,

No, I´ve never seen her.
Frank ?
Hey, Frankie !
How was your day, hmm ?
Oh, yeah ? That´s nice.
Mine ? Not so good.
Excuse me. Are you
the person who saw her ?
Yeah.
Is this her ?
Where ?
Yeah, that´s her.
I saw her down there
in the food court.
There ? Right there ?
Yeah.
When ?
At 2:30 this afternoon.
Excuse me.
Hollis. Hollis !
What do you got ?
Thephoto store.
Where ? Where ?
The photo store.
Here. Right here.
This is where he shot it.
See ? There´s our
little bird. Hello ?
- Hey ! Hey !
- Sorry.
Do you know this woman ?
Uh, yeah. Shejust
started working here.
It´s Ellie.
I´ll need her phone number
and last name. Right now.
Get her number now.
Okay.
I have to call my boss.
- Do it. Do it !
- Okay.
- Goddamn cows.
-
Hello.
Mom ? Calm down.
What is it ?
No, I´m sure that
you´re overreacting.
Gimme a break.
Whyareyousaying that ?
Look, Mom. I very much doubt
that your pharmacist
isjust trying to poison you.
Can we not do this
right now, Mom ? I´m in
the middle ofa movie.
Yeah, Mom, with a man.
Yeah, he´s cute.
I-I don´t know
if it´s serious or not.
Look. If I tell you
his name, will you
let me get offthe phone ?
His name is Frank.
Good-bye.
-
-
- Come on. Come on.
-
-
-
Yes ?
Uh, I need to speak
to Ellie Buckner immediately.
Oh, she can´t come
to the phone right now.
No, no, please, please.
Put her on the line immediately.
It´s a life-or-death emergency.
Not anymore it´s not.
Wasn´t that fun ?
It hasn´t felt
that good foryears.
Wasn´t it suspenseful ?
Oh, yeah,
that was a blast.
This way is much more fun.
It´s amazing, isn´t it ?
We´re all stacked
right on top ofeach other,
but we don´t really notice
each other anymore, do we ?
You notice me though,
don´t you,Joel ?
Yeah, I notice you.
Ellie Buckner.
Single, 24,
parents live in Florida.
So far, no known boyfriend.
She has a cat named Frank.
Apparently, he doesn´t watch
the news.
Wonder what happened
to that cat ?
Pull the phone records,
okay ?
Diaries, journals,
letters, address book.
See if he´s in contact
with these girls.
Hey, ma´am.
Can you spare some change ?
Hey, guys.
Hey, Dad !
Dad, don´t you
recognize me ?
Hey, sir. Can you
spare some change ?
What are you
doing out here ?
Spare changing, man.
What´s it look like ?
- Don´t you have a job
or anything ?
- Yeah, whatever.
Look. Are you gonna give me
some money, or what ?
- Only ifyou dance with me.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I´m serious.
- There´s no music.
- I´ll lead, you follow.
-
And one, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Damn it.
Having a tough time there,
aren´t you, with that ?
I need a damn garden rake
to eat this.
It´s all in the tool.
I´m done with that
for sure.
So, listen here.
What´s the skinny on that
radiant vision of loveliness
down at the feds ?
What´s her name ?
Diana ?
What I wouldn´t give for 20
minutes with her at a drive-in
and a decent bowl ofchili.
Damn ifyou haven´t found
the worst restaurant
in the whole city of Chicago.
A really fine restaurant.
The other night, Griffi n
was giving me...
a hard time about it
too on the telephone.
What´s up ?
What´s up ?
What do you think
the chances are
he´s watching us right now ?
Hey. Hey !
Get outta here.
Murder suspect heading
west on Commerce, near
the intersection of Lincoln.
BIue, two-doorsedan,
mid- ´80s, maybe a Ford.
Fuck !
Goddamn it !
I´m standing outside
the apartment ofEIIie Buckner,
the woman who Chicago
has come to know as ''Jane Doe.''
The harrowing search
came to a tragic end
about 9:20 P.M.,
when police discovered
Buckner´s body at her
Wicker Park apartment.
It is a murder that has shocked
this quiet neighborhood.
Right--
Seeyou Iater. Bye.
Excuse me.
I can´t stay long.
I just wanted to
come by...
and tell you how much
I appreciate...
what you...
said the other day.
How have
the headaches been ?
About the same.
Are you sleeping ?
Some.
How´s work ?
It´s great. I´m building
an excellent fan base
with the homicidal set.
How do you feel
about that,
about this man
following you to Chicago ?
Is it a vendetta ?
That´s a strange question.
No, I don´t think vengeance
has anything to do with it.
I think there´s a story,
a ritual that he follows.
Over the years, I became
part ofthe story.
It probably didn´t
make sense without me.
In other words,
he missed you.
Odd, isn´t it ?
Did you miss him ?
What the hell
does that mean ?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Campbell.
We received another photo.
I´ll be right there.
Where is she sitting ?
Let´s get somebody
from the city up here.
See ifthey can
tell us something about
this section ofsidewalk.
Is this the ''El'' here,
you know ? Parking meters.
Yep, I´m on it.
Mitch, let´s get her picture
in tattoo parlors.
Got it.
What´s your name ?
Well, usually,
Mr. Abraham,
I do an introductory session,
where we both expIore
whatyou hope toget
out oftherapy.
Ifwe both feel
I´m the person
to provide that foryou,
then we can decide
on a schedule together.
And-- AndIIike
to recordmysessions.
But ifyou prefer--
Is that something that you do
with all ofyour patients ?
Yeah, with most ofthem.
- Would you prefer
that I didn´t ?
- Yes, I´dratheryou not.
Okay.
That´s-- That´s fine.
So, yousaythat
you might needheIp.
In-In what area ?
I´m not sure.
What kind of help
do you provide ?
Well, I-I work with patients
on many different issues.
Do you think...
some ofyour patients...
might pay to come and see you
because... you´re very pretty ?
Let´s keep this focused
on you, rather than on me,
Mr. Abraham.
Sure.
Nice trick.
I´m gonna try it
again though, okay ?
Yeah, whatever.
A coupIe ofyears ago, they did
a neighborhoodrenovation...
where they put
those benches around
some ofthe trees downtown.
Where downtown ?
Bring up the city.
BasicaIIythe Broadway
andBeImont area.
That´s 1 5 to 20 city blocks.
Yeah.
There are five miIIion
peopIe in this city.
Howcan no one
have known thisperson ?
Can you spare some change ?
Howcan thishappen
in the communication age ?
Authoritieshave focused
thesearch for 'Jane Doe #2''--
Hey, Dad. Dad, it´s me.
Don´t you recognize me ?
Leave me alone.
Come on, Pop.
I need you, man.
The cityofChicago is on aIert.
Police are searching for a woman
connected to the photograph
they have received.
It appears the murder may be
linked to a serial killer
in the Los Angeles area.
At thispoint, the woman
poIice are caIIing 'Jane2''...
has not yet been located...
-andaIIthose invoIvedare very
concernedabout her weII-being.
-
Yeah.
We´ve gotJane Doe´s
mother on the phone.
I´ll be right there.
You know what ? Get a picture
at every skateboarding place
and guitar shop...
that´s anywhere near that
Broadway and--
Belmont.
Belmont. Exactly.
Wish I could find
some letters.
There aren´t any.
She never wrote anybody.
She caIIedthree times.
Did she say where
she was calling from ?
She said all kinds ofthings.
I never knew what to believe.
She has a new boyfriend.
- So tell me
about the boyfriend.
- He´s a lawyer. Yeah, right.
Can you remember anything
else about the calls ?
Anything might help.
A few months ago, she called
to announce she´s got a job

Hi,Joel.
How´s the heart, pal ?
Here.
You want a beer ?
It would make it
feel better.
Stop.
Here.
Tell me something.
Did you move 2,000 miles to live
near this woman´s grave ?
You did, didn´t you ?
Man, you´vegotta
get out more.
I mean, is this
a satisfying relationship ?
You know, she loves me.
She´s decomposing.
She Iovesme.
She´s decomposing.
What are we doing here ?
What is this ? You here
to give yourself up ?
Why didn´t you tell anyone
you were fucking her ?
Just ´causeshe wasmarried?
We don´t seem
to be communicating.
Let me be clear with you.
I have no problem
with shooting you
dead where you sit.
Well, you do
have one problem.
If I´m dead,
your friend Polly
is going to meet
a rather gruesome fate...
invoIving candIeIight andquite
a IargepooIofkerosene.
And you know something
about attractive women
burning, don´t you ?
Tell me, what was it like ?
Could you smell
her flesh burning ?
You´ve already killed her.
Come on. You know me
better than that.
That´s not even her blood.
Take me to see her then.
Oh, I don´t know about that.
Can´t wejust sit here
for a little while
and talk,Joel ?
We´ll talk once I see her.
I just need to know
ifthere´s anything
to talk about.
Go on, take it.
I just need to see
that she´s all right,
then we´ll talk.
Well, fine.
Let´s go.
It´s good
to see you,Joel.
It really is.
Wow, it´s loaded.
We´re going to make it
through this, aren´t we,Joel ?
I think that´s more
up to you than it is to me.
You look older
since you were in L.A.
You´re a good friend.
You´re like a brother to me.
Didyou knowthat ?
Do you have any real
brothers or sisters ?
What the fu--
What is that ?
I´m trying to have
a reaIconversation,
and you´re psychoanalyzing me.
- What are you, Dr. Polly now ?
- I wasjust curious.
Look at me when I talk to you.
You´re trying to control
this situation. Stop trying
to control this situation.
Can´tyoujust Ieaveyourjob
out ofthis ?Just this once ?
I´m telling you.
I thinkyou´re spending too much
time with that Polly bitch.
What do you need ?
I want you to think
about what you need.
It´s up to me
to try and get that
and make an exchange.
Anything you need
for Ms. Beilman´s safety.
What I need is you.
Hold on.
Hello.
I knew if I just came here
and talked to you in person,
you´d understand me
better,Joel.
Fuck me, he´s got
Campbell ! Trace it !
You were the onIyone
who thought about me,
who really knew me.
For a long time,
I was the only one you had.
Andthenyou met Lisa.
Pull in here.
Give me a second.
Give me a second.
Okay, he´s about 20 miles
north ofthe city.
Yeah, you´re gonna have
to do better than that.
Now come on.
No shit !
Give me another minute and
we´ll have his exact location.
Igot him ! Igot him.
He´s right on the water.
Come on in.
Polly,Joel.

Wakey, wakey,Joel.
That hurts, doesn´t it ?
I´ve heard that flashing
lights and migraines don´t
go together at all.
You´re no fun.
-
- Oh, no, Polly. No, no,
I´m not gonna kill him.
We need each other.
We define each other.
We´re... yin and yang,
black and white.
- Isn ´t that right, PoIIy ?
-
Polly ?
Isaid, ''Isn ´t that right ?''
I don´t understand
the question.
Didyou ordidyou not,
inyourprofessionaIopinion,
reach the conclusion thatJoel
and I need each other in order
to give meaning to our lives ?
Yes. Yes, but I--
See ?
Take your fucking
hands off her.
I said take your
fucking hands off her.
Sit down,Joel.
Sit down.
I´ll sit here and listen
to you talk all night.
Just take your hands off her.
Come on, put the fucking
gun down. We both know
you´re notgonna do it.
And why do we know that ?
Because you can
only kill her once.
He´s right.
He´s right.
Upsy daisy.
How´s this for deja vu ?
We´ve got the fire.
We´ve got the pretty girl.
Only instead
of bringing us together,
you move to Chicago.
The guilt must
have been unbearable.
Or something like that.
Is that what
you want me to say ?
I feel guilty
a woman is dead because
I made a terrible mistake.
No.
No, no.
That wasn´t the mistake.
The mistake was turning
back instead of pouring
all you had into us.
What do I want you to say ?
I want you to say thankyou.
I want you to say thankyou
for coming here and saving
your pathetic life.
David, do you know how many
serial killers are active
in Chicago right now ?
Five.
In the Midwest,
at least a dozen.
I could work on any one ofthem
without even packing a bag.
You get hit by a bus
on a Thursday, I´m working
on a new guy on Monday.
You´re myjob.
You´re paperwork.
I can´t believe
you still don´t know
who you´re talking to.
No, no, no !
No, please don´t--
I have to do this.
He´s not going to
understand anything else.
You heardhim. ''Paperwork. ''
Thankyou.
- What did you say ?
- I said, ''Thankyou.''
Tell me again.
I said, ''Thankyou.''
Get out of here.
Let´s go !
Run, run !
Joel ! Joel !
Give me your hand !
Reach for it !
Ready ? Reach.
Here you go.
You all right ?
Give me that blanket.
Where´s the girl ?
Is she all right ?
She´s right overthere.
Let´s get
the fucking body out.
Okay.
It´sneverquite that easy.
Yougo through the door.
They´re neverjustsitting there
waiting foryou with a weIcoming
smiIe on theirface.
The bestyou can do ishope
they fuck up anddo whatyou can
to be there when they do.
Time´s up.
