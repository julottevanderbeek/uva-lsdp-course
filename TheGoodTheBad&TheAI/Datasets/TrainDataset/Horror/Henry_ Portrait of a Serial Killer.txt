and you was going to catch it
and you did didn't you?

We don't have
to talk about it ever.
How long are you
going to be up here?
lt's hard to say.
What about Lurleen?
How long can you

l'm going to get a job,
make some money.
Maybe bring her up here,

You hungry?
Yeah.
Good, l'm hungry too.
Do you think Leroy is hungry?
Do you want more coffee?

What else can you do
besides dance naked?
Don't start

l can do lots of things mister.
Oh yea, like what?
Like waitressing

After seeing you l might

You're a card.

Otis: Yea, the queen of clubs.
Don't make me sorry
l came here, Otis.
Howdy.
Hey, Henry.

She's gonna be staying here with
us for a while like l said.
Becky this here is Henry.
Hello Henry.
Hello Becky.
Good to meet you.
She don't look nothing like you,

Lucky for her.
Henry's on his way out west.
Becky: oh, where?

Oh.
She can sleep on the couch.
No, no. Listen Becky l want
you to take the spare room.
No, Henry, thank you but no...

Ain't that right Otis?
Up to you.
Alright, but if it gets
to be a bother, we'll change.
Fair enough.
Well, l got to get going.

Otis: Up to you.

Otis: Sure thing...

Otis: See ya.
Fuckin' pervert.
Becky: Oh, it's so gross...

Otis: l'll do it.
Becky: That's alright.
Where did you say you met him?
Otis: Who?
You know who...Henry.
Otis: What do you want
to know for?
Becky: l don't know...
l'm just curious.
Van Dalia.
Van Dalia?
Sure, Van Dalia.
Oh, what was he in for?
Otis:
You don't want to know.
What did he do?
Kill his mama?
Uh, huh.
Becky: Come on...
what was he in for?
You don't want to know.
What did he do?
Rob a bank or something?
Otis: You were right
the first time.
Huh?
You were right the first time.
He killed his mama.
Otis: Don't you ever
tell him l told you.
You're kidding me?
Otis: No, l ain't.
Yes you are.
Alright, l'm kidding you.
Just don't ever
tell him l told you.
He killed his mama?
With a baseball bat...
her and one of her boyfriends.
l swear if you
ever tell him l told you
l'll beat your ass right off.
How do you know all this?
Otis: He told me,
that's how l know.
How else would l know?
Were you
cellmates or something?
No, we were friends.
When did he get out?
Otis: A couple
of years before me.
Hi.
upbeat music
l got some business
l got to take care of.
You going out?
For a while, l got to run
an errand for a fellow.
You want to come along Henry?
No, you go ahead.
See you later.
Want to play cards?
Sure.
Becky: What was
your daddy like?
My daddy?
He used to drive a truck before
he got his legs cut off.
l remember one time...
he brought me and
my little brother home bicycles.
He had delivered some that day
and he had a couple left over.
But, mine was way too big for me
and my brother
he couldn't ride his anyway.
Daddy, he said l'd grow into it,
but, l never did.
Becky: Why not?
l never got the chance,
they sold it.
They sold them both.
Becky: So you have
a brother?
My brother, he had
a bone disorder.
He was
a little deformed.
What happened to him?
Henry: He died.
l can't ever remember
really liking my daddy.
l wanted to, l really did.
One time he bought me,
when l was about five,
he bought me an ice cream cone
and l dropped it.
And he slapped me and
made me pick it up and eat it.
l never liked my daddy.
One time, when my momma was
at work, and l was about 13,
he come into my room and he
told me to take my shirt off
'cause he wanted to see
how l was developed.
And when l wouldn't
he got real mad and he hit me.
And he told me he had a right
because he was my daddy
and l was his daughter
and he fed me
and let me live in his house
and he could
do whatever he wanted.
And he did.
Then he started coming
into my room a lot, after that.
l didn't fight him because
when l did he just hit me.
l was afraid
l was going to have a baby
and that my baby
would be deformed
but, l never got pregnant.
l tried to tell mama,
but she didn't
want to hear about it.
She pretended not to believe me
but l knew she did.
lt sure is good to talk...
to talk to you Henry
because l know
you're not judgmental
or anything like that.
l never would have married Leroy
in the first place
if l hadn't wanted to get away
from daddy so bad.
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?
Did you really kill your mama?
What?
Did you really
kill your mama?
l guess l did.
How did it happen?
l stabbed her.
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.
Otis said that?
Yeah.
Well, he's mistaken.
Well, don't tell him l told you,
he made me promise.
She must have treated
you real bad.
She was a whore.
My mama was a whore.
But l don't fault her for that.
lt ain't what she done
it's how she done it.
As long as l can remember she'd
be bringing men up to the house.
My daddy was there too
but it didn't matter
nothing to her.
She make me watch it.
That's creepy.
She beat me too, a lot.
She beat me
when l wouldn't watch it.
And sometime she'd beat me
make me wear a dress
and watch her doing it.
and then they'd laugh at me.
She made you wear a dress?
You think l'm lying?
l feel like l know you
like l've known you
for a long time.
l feel like l've known you
for ever and ever.
Yeah...l killed my mama...
one night.
lt was my 1 4th birthday
and she was drunk
and we had an argument.
And she hit me
with a whiskey bottle
l shot her...
l shot her dead.
l thought you said
you stabbed her?
Oh yeah.
That's right...
l stabbed her.
Hey.
Anything good on TV?
upbeat music
Becky: l got a job today.
Otis: Oh yeah?
Doing what?
Becky: At a beauty parlor.
Otis: A beauty parlor?
Becky: l'm a shampoo girl.
Otis: What's that?
Becky: What's it sound like,
you dummy?
Otis: How the hell
should l know?
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?
Becky: l give shampoos...
a woman gets her hair shampooed
before she gets it cut
and l do it.
Otis: They pay you for that?
Becky: Of course they do.
Besides l used to do it some
back home after l met Leroy.
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?
Don't start with me Otis.
You used to dance naked?
Sure, all the time
around the house.
Otis.
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.
You never.
Were you really a dancer?
l danced some, in a club
and l wasn't naked.
l wore a costume
but l guess
it wasn't very much.
Huh.
When you gonna
dance for us?
When the pope pees
in his hat, Otis.
Ain't she got
a mouth on her?
l better have something
on me to defend me
from a pig like you.
Otis...
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.
Thank you Henry.
At least there's
one gentleman at this table.
l'm sorry honey.
don't get mad.
l'm just having a little fun
with you that's all.
Oh, wait,
l got something to show you.
Wait.
ta-da!
Nice.
Real nice.
Put it on.
Right now?
Uh-huh.
OK, but turn around first...
turn around!
O.K., you can look.
What does it say on there?
l love Chicago.
Looks good, don't it Otis?
Uh-huh.
Oh, hey honey,
Why don't you bring me a beer,
this one is empty.
l ain't your maid,
get it yourself.
Oh, now come on honey,
l ain't asking you to wash
the windows or nothing...
l just want a beer.
Come on, bring your poor old
brother a beer, will ya?
Don't do that Otis.
She's your sister!
O.K., l was only
kidding around, Henry.
Tell her you're sorry.
O.K., l'm sorry.
Now, tell her
you won't do it again.
l won't, l swear Becky
l swear, l won't.
Ouch!
Shit, Henry!
Serves you right.
Thank you, Henry.
That's alright.
Becky: Listen,
l'll do the dishes.
l don't mind, l don't.
Listen, why don't you boys
go out and get a beer.
l'll do these,
l don't mind, honest.
Well, what do you say Otis?
You want to go grab a beer?
Sure, l don't mind.
l'll just go spruce up.
That was a real nice
supper, Becky.
Thanks.
Have fun.
Yea.

woman: Oh, come on, slow down!
Easy tiger, easy!
Now, wait a minute!
Hey come on, l'm not kidding!
Suzie!!
Otis, come here...
l'll drive.
Otis: What's gonna happen
when they find those bodies?
Nothing.
What do you
mean nothing?
Just what l said Otis,
nothing.
Nothing's gonna happen
cause nothing happened.
And l don't know nothing
about it whatever it is.
Do you?
Hey, l don't know nothing.
Good.
Otis: Oh, fuck.
Feeling better?
Yes.
Do you want some fries?
You telling me you never
killed anybody before?
l ain't saying that.
Then you've killed
before, right?
Well, maybe l didn't
have no choice.
You didn't have
no choice here neither.
Did you?
Huh?
Did you?
l don't know,
it ain't the same.
lt's always the same...
and it's always different.
What do you mean?
lt's either you or them
one way or the other.
Ain't that right?
Open your eyes, Otis.
Look at the world.
lt's either you or them.
You know what l mean.
Yea.
Good.
You want a beer?
O.K.
There was only one left.
...nothing about this
but you can bet a dollar to a
doughnut that when he finds out,
and he will find out
'cause l'll tell him
there'll be hell to pay.
Becky: Really.
l'll never go back there again
l can tell you that...
not when he's not there anyway.
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.
lt's gone down so badly
the way it's changed
it breaks my heart.
lt's like that all over.
People spit at you.
l wish l was lying.
You can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.
Ah, shit!
What did you do that for?
l guess l got carried away.
Well, l guess you did, Otis.
Shit...l got to have a TV.
Well, let's go shopping.
So what can l do
for you gentlemen?
lt's hot in here, isn't it?
l'm kind of cold.
We want a TV.
How much you got to spend?
What do you got?
$50 bucks.
l can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.
Well, turn it on
we want to see if it works.
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?
No.
Here plug it in
down here.
Here?
Yeah, down there, real good.
l see you've had some college.
Like you can see
it works real good...
Just takes a while to warm up.
lt's black and white!
Of course it's black and white.
What do you expect for 50 bucks?
Fuckin' 3-D for christ sake.
Well, how much is color?
We want color.
You can't get color
for 50 dollars.
That's O.K.
let's see what you got.
What have l got?
You want cable ready?
You want remote control?
You want UHF?
You want 13''?

You want Sony?
You want Zenith?
You want a Gold Star?
What can we get for a $150?

For an extra $75...
you can take this $600 set.

You just pop in a cassette
and you're ready to go.
You can make
your own movies with that?
What else
would you do with it?
How much you want for it?
lt's worth a grand...
l'd take half.
Yeah...half of a grand is $500.
That's a little more
than we were planning to spend

just take the TV.
O.K., which one do you want?
The $50 one.
The $50 one...
You guys come in here
l show this
l show you that
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend?
You should have

Well, we were
really counting on a color set.
What's the matter?
You got shit in your ears?
The black and white is $50,

Sorry we wasted your time,

He said hi.
Yea, uh, huh.
Look l'll do the best l can,
but l don't promise...
Fuck him.
Yea, yea good-bye. crazy guy!
What?
Some jerk off hasn't been out
of jail six months,
gets drunk
gets busted up in a fight
so he goes home and gets a gun
and comes back later
and shoots the guy.
They find the gun on him.
He claims he was framed.
What are you going to do?
So uh ...
everything going O.K.?
Yeah.
Still working at Bobs Gas?
Yes sir.
Good, you working everyday?
Two, three days a week.
lt's a little slow now.
Well, if it's less than

Bye.
You got it?
Got what?
You know what.
Here you go.
Wanna try it?
Damn you, son of a bitch!
Fuckin'...!
Let me see that.
That little
fuckin' bastard.
l ought to kill him.
l ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.
That'd be a mistake.
Look who's talking.
Watch your mouth Otis.
l'm sorry, Henry.
You kill that
high school boy
they're going to slap
your ass right back in jail.
Otis that's a promise.
People have seen you together.
l'd still like
to kill him though.
l bet you would.
l'd like to kill somebody.
Say that again.
l'd like to kill somebody.
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.
dramatic music
Here, l want
to show you something.
Where did you get this?
Careful Otis...
it's loaded.
Where did you get it?
Guns are easy to get.
l can make a phone call
and get a gun.
Anybody can get a gun Otis.
What do you got in mind Henry?
What do you think?
l don't know.
Put up the hood.
Why?
Just put up the hood, Otis.
You guys need any help?
Otis, do you need some help
or can you do it yourself?
Feel better?
Yeah.
Alright.
lf you shoot somebody
in the head with a 45
everytime you kill somebody
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.
But if you strangle one
and stab another...
one you cut up
one you don't
then the police
don't know what to do.
They think you're
four different people.
What they really like...
what makes their job
so much easier...
a pattern.
What they call
a modus operandi.
That's Latin...
bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?
Big fuckin' deal.
What?
lt's like a trail
of shit, Otis.
lt's like a blood droppings
from a deer you've shot
and all they gotta do
is follow those droppings
and pretty soon they're going
to find that deer.
Why do we use a gun?
You can use a gun.
l'm not saying you can't
use a gun...
just don't use
the same gun twice.
The most important thing
is to keep moving...
that way they might
never catch up to you.
l'm gonna have to pack up and
be on the move too, pretty soon.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Do you wanna come?
We could be back this way
in about a month.
l'm not supposed to leave
the state without telling them.
So who's gonna know?
As long as you show up
when you're supposed to?
What if they
check up on me at work?
Well, no plan is perfect.

Oh yea!
Pull up next to her, please...
Look what you did!!
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
Look at it... it's ruined.
Damn Henry you ought to look
where you're driving.
Who the hell told you to stick
your head out the window anyway?
You could of killed me!
That's right... blame it on me!
Oh, this fucking camera!
What did you do that for?
lt wasn't any good anymore.
Could have fixed it.
Shit, the lens
was busted right off!
Could have fixed it!
How do you know?
You a camera repair man?!
You should have said something.
You didn't give
me a chance Otis.
You threw the fucker
right out the window.
lt ain't my fault it broke.
Oh right.
Go back and get it if you want.
Yeah.
Want to get a beer?
Not particularly.
l want a beer.
lf you want a beer so bad, Otis
go ahead and get one.
All right, l will.
See you later.
Yeah.
l talked to Lurleen.
Yea?
You'd like her...
God, l miss her.
l'm thinking...
l might be heading

You quit what?
My job.
What happened?
l just figured
it was time to go home.
You want to come with me?
l thought you wanted
to make some money?
Yeah...but...
l'm thinking l don't want to
bring Lurleen up here after all.
You know that was my intention.
There's just too much
going on up here.
She'd get lost.
We're better off
living with mama.
l can work back home,
l won't make as much money,
l'm sure.
But we won't need
as much either.
l can live with mama.
You can stay there, too.
You figure it's safe
to go back?
l hope so.
Leroy's in jail for murder and
his bond's a million dollars.
So, unless he wins the lottery
Leroy won't be going anywhere
for quite a while.
Where's Otis?
He had a dinner date
l think he said.
Really?
Come with me?
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
Huh.
Better think fast Henry.
You got your ticket?
Not yet, but my mind's made up.

Let me think!
Let me think!
You want to listen
to the radio?
Henry...
that was so awful.
l'm scared.
What do we do now?
We just got to keep moving
that's for sure.
My sister owns a ranch
outside of San Bernadino.
She raises horses there.
She's got about
Arabians...
they're beautiful.
We can stay there
as long as we want to.
What about Lurleen?
We'll send for her
as soon as we get there.
You promise?
l promise.
l love you Henry.
l guess, l love you too.
Where are we
going to go now?
We'll find a place.
You want to listen
to the radio?
O.K.
This is a nice guitar...
used to play a little...
but, l'm out of practice.
We better go to bed now.
