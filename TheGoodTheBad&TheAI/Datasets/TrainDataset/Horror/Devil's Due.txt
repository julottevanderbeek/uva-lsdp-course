Let's just take it from
the top, Mr. McCall.
Mr. McCall?
I told you, I didn't do it.
Have a good night.
Thank you so much.
See you tomorrow. Good night.
Oh, fun for you.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, what?
Good night.
We'll clean up. I love you.
Oh, shit.
Ugh, Zach! Stop, Maverick.
Jesus Christ! Maverick, stop.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on, get off.
You scared the shit out of me.
Go away. Come on, buddy.
Get out, get out.
You're not supposed
to see me tonight.
Come on, I mean, that
is a dumb tradition.
You don't believe it.
No, no, I don't believe it.
Oh, shit, you do.
Okay, I kind of do.
You should just...
What are you doing?
Okay, ready? Okay.
Ladies, oop, and gentlemen,
I'd like to present
the McCalls.
Almost. Almost.
Okay, I got to get dressed.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
hold on, hold on.
Just strike. Strike
that pose, right there.
I just want to... I want to
capture our last night together.
We're not dying.
My dad used to follow us around
with one of these constantly.
My mom gave him
so much shit for it.
I think it's sweet.
I wish I had something
like that.
My whole childhood
is kind of a blank.
That's kind of why
I want to do this.
I mean, I don't know, I used
to think my dad was so lame,
with all his nostalgia
and all that,
but I don't know,
I kind of get it now.
I kind of want this for us.
I just want a record
of all the important things
that happen to us
and all the, like,
random stupid stuff
that we'll forget about.
Hmm, yeah.
Tomorrow we are
officially a family.
So tonight,
I want to start
our family history.
Family history.
Yeah.
I love that.
Good.
She looks... Beautiful, yeah.
She looks amazing.
She looks gorgeous.
She really does.
In sickness and in health.
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish.
To love and to cherish.
Till death do us apart.
Till death do us apart.
With this ring I thee wed.
With this ring I thee wed.
And pledge myself
to thee forever.
And pledge myself
to thee forever.
Love me tender WOMAN: Really?
Love me true So beautiful!
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling
All right, buddy!
I love you...
I just wanted to say thank you
to Ken and Sally
for making me feel so at home.
I've never really felt
like I was part of
a family before,
so thank you for being so...
welcoming and wonderful.
Dad had, like, the first camera.
You know, he'd carry it
on his shoulder like this.
Just, I wanted you to know that,
you know,
I think you are
a wonderful brother,
and I think this
is a beautiful...
I'm being serious!
This is a beautiful event,
and I'm really grateful
that you invited me.
We were in the same
foster home together for a year,
and we were more
than friends, family.
I hope that you guys
will be happy forever.
So, here's to happily
ever after.
Oh, gosh.
Mmm.
I'm sorry, are you okay?
MAN: Come on, let's do this!
Sam,
my beautiful wife.
This was the most perfect day.
I can't believe we're married.
And when we watch this, like,
a lot of years from now,
just remember
how good-looking I was.
I love you so much.
I promise I will...
always protect you.
Keep you safe.
I love you.
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
SAMANTHA: Here we go.
This is your captain speaking.
I'd like to welcome you
to the Dominican Republic.
We realize there are
many airlines you could have
chosen and we thank you
for flying with us today.
This is gonna be awesome.
ZACH: Now the honeymoon begins.
SAMANTHA: Ooh.
Oh, wow.
ZACH: We're going
to do this, like,
swimsuit issue type thing.
Oh, God! No, no,
you're gonna go in the water.
Uh-huh.
And then you're gonna
come out of the water.
Is that how I'm gonna do it?
You just... Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry,
I'm right behind you.
Okay.
This is gonna go fast.
No, it's not.
Oh, my God.
Christopher Columbus.
ZACH: Oh, really? Yeah.
This is the first cathedral
in the New World.
The Cathedral of Santo Domingo.
It's, uh, the...
"It's Gothic style highlighted
with Renaissance details."
SAMANTHA :
Oh, my God,
I have never seen anything
so fucking perfect before
in my life.
Look at this sea of white.
Oh, my gosh.
What's that?
: That's my husband.
Wake up.
Hey.
:  Oogum,
Oogum, Boogum, Boogum, Boogum
Now, baby, you're casting
your spell on me
Your high heel boots
In your hip-huggin' suit
You got it right
You're outta sight...
What is that?
It's the coolest
wedding present ever.
Mason gave it to us;
It's an adventure cam.
Oh, good,
that's what I always wanted.
I know. I know.
And now we can go zip-lining.
Come on. Yay!
ZACH:
Just get your game face on.
All right.
Hold on.
Hold on!
Whoa.
SAMANTHA: Wow.
SAMANTHA: Where are we?
Zach, come here.
We're going here.
Whoa.
Come on.
ZACH: Hey, wait up,
wait up, wait up.
WOMAN: Oh.
Hi. Welcome.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
ZACH: Hi.
Welcome.
Have a seat.
Okay.
I will study your palm.
SAMANTHA: Okay.
Which one do you want?
This one.
ZACH: I don't think it matters.
Oh, well, they're different.
You've had some hard times,
but-but now you're so happy.
You're happy now.
ZACH: She's good.
No family.
No past.
You were...
born from death.
What do you mean?
They've been waiting.
ZACH: Do you want to go? Yeah.
They've been waiting. Whoa.
Okay. They've been waiting.
All right, let's, um...
ZACH: Excuse me, ma-ma'am.
They... Thank you. Jesus.
That's fine.
They've been waiting.
Okay. All right.
You are the first.
The first of many. All
right, thanks. Okay.
That's great.
You will bring the end.
All right, thank you.
You know what, let's go.
Let's go. Thank you very much.
You've been... No,

All right. Ow, ow, stop.
Let go of me, please.
Ma'am, ma'am,

Okay, let's go.
Let's go, let's go. All right.
Zach, let's go. Come on.
Okay, okay.
ZACH: Hey, you okay?
What did she say to you?
Nothing. Fucking nothing.
I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, forget her, okay?
She was crazy.
I just... what did she whisper
in your ear?
I don't know.
It was just, like,
a bunch of gibberish.
She stank of rum anyway.
I just want to get back
to the hotel.
ZACH: I don't remember
this street. Do you?
SAMANTHA: Do you want
to go down this way?
ZACH: Let's turn around.
Okay.
ZACH: Jesus.
Let's go.
ZACH: They don't have
any street signs.
SAMANTHA: Can we just
head back towards, like,
where the party was?
I don't real...
ZACH: You a taxi? Yeah.
ZACH: That's your family?
B-b-babies? SAMANTHA: Oh, no.
ZACH: Oh, no, not yet.
SAMANTHA:
No?
ZACH: We, uh,
DRIVER: Tengo mucho,
mucho, mucho bebés.
ZACH: Someday.
One day, yeah.
I take you somewhere fun.
ZACH: No, no, no, we're good.
Thank you.
We just want to go back
to the, um, hotel, yeah?
Yeah. No, no, no, no. No worry.
I-I, this place, eh,
eh...
It's special, special.
ZACH: What do you think?
One more drink?
No.
Oh, eh,
ZACH:
It's our last night.

ZACH: Deal. Fine.
Deal.
All right, fine. One drink.

Yes, this is...
This looks... great.
ZACH: Uh... Okay.
Okay. Ahora, tu

SAMANTHA: ZACH: Okay.
Yeah, thank you.
ZACH: You don't look happy.
Yeah, well, where are we?
I don't know, but it
is gonna be cool.
Okay. Okay.
Careful. Right. Okay.
Oh!
ZACH: This little guy.
SAMANTHA: Hey, little guy.
DRIVER: Whew.
I'm right here, I'm right here.
Shh.
Hey, music, music, mus...
Yeah.
Ah! ZACH: Music.
It's
SAMANTHA: Yeah, I hear it.
Wait, this is...
No, Zach, come on,
let's go back.
No, this is crazy. Come

Let's turn around.
Hey,
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.
I'm right here.
Don't worry.Jesus.
I'm right here, all right?
Come on. Fuck. I'm right here.
Okay. I don't...
We'll go slow.
SAMANTHA: Oh, it's okay.
ZACH: Sorry, what?
Uh...
Um, wow.
Okay.
ZACH: Don't worry. It's fine.
I promise. See?
Oh, sorry, excuse me.
SAMANTHA: I don't, either!
It's special!
Come on.
ZACH: This is insane!
What's happening?
ZACH: Hey, hey.
This is not my dance!
All
right, all right, all right.
Yeah, come on, go for it.
Oh, see how great.
Here we go. Yeah, cheers!
Yes, beautiful!
Here goes.
ZACH: Here we go.
Oh, gonna hold my nose.
Ahh! Yeah!
That's not how you take a sh...
it was... you sipped it.
No, that wasn't...
You got to do another.
Oh, God. One more.
Oh, my God! Congratulations!
SAMANTHA: Yeah!
ZACH: Oh, thank you!
And they just got married, too.
We did!
ZACH: No way!
GIRL: Yes!
SAMANTHA: Yeah, go!
I'm done.
ZACH: Oh, yes!
Yeah! Oh!
Mmm.
These men are staring at me.
What?
I said, "These men are
staring at me." Oh.
ZACH: You worry.
All right.
I guess you'll do.
You guess?
I can't dance anymore.
ZACH: Hey!
SAMANTHA: Hi!
Hey, babe, let's put it away.
ZACH : Oh, God.
Come on, wife.
Time to get up.
Come on. No.
Yes.
I'm sorry,
but we got to get up.
I'm so hungover.
Yeah, no kidding.
Oh, God, get away with that.
No, I know, but come on.
I'll get you some water,
but we got to get up.
We got to catch this plane.
Okay. Oh, God.
Yeah, my head is killing me.
Me, too.
Oh, shit.
I'm stuck.
How did we get home last night?
I don't know,
the guy in the cab?
Stop.
Not right now.
ZACH:
See you later, Santo Domingo.
ZACH: Well, we're home.
Home, sweet home.
Honeymoon is over.
Ooh, wait, wait,
wait, wait or...
Hold this. Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah. Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
Welcome home, Mrs. McCall. Aw.
SAMANTHA: Ugh.
ZACH:
Oh, Suzie left the door open.
Great. That's great.
ZACH: Here we are.
SAMANTHA : Yay, home.
Ooh.
Presents. Ooh.
Crate & Barrel, Crate & Barrel,
Crate & Barrel.
I'll go get the bags.
All right,
we got the panini grill
and that thing from Allison.
Oh.
And what... is this one?
I don't know, open it up.
Mav, do you want to open this?
All right.
He doesn't care.
Okay, this is...
the juicer that I wanted!
I'm gonna make
so much stuff with, like,
flax and probiotics and...
things with kale.
Kale?
Mmm.
: Kale, shh, kale.
SAMANTHA: Oh, Mav.
Mav, give me...
give me the bun.
Mav, give me the bun.
Oh, my God.
Look at him. Oh.
Damn, that... Oh, wow.
Hey, did you see the "sold" sign
on the Anderson house?
ZACH: Oh, for real?
: Maybe someone
will finally fix that place up.
I hope so. Hey, uh, Samantha?
It's terrible. Your husband.
I know.
He can't grill for shit.
ZACH: Sam, come on,
you're gonna miss it.
All right,
this is gonna be awesome.
Ready? Just like we practiced.
Are you kidding me?
Come on. Maverick, no, no, no.
You're not...
You're supposed to catch it.
SAMANTHA: Zach? Yeah?
ZACH: Come on, ready?
Eye on the prize,
eye on the prize.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Zach? What?
Can you turn that off
for one second?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?
Uh...
I...
It, uh, it doesn't make
any sense.
I mean, I've taken
the pill religiously.
I've never missed one ever.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
holy-holy sh...
You're pregnant?
Yes. Oh, my God.
We're having a baby.
Holy shit.
Aah! Oh, my God!
That's so amazing.
Oh, my God.
ZACH: I feel good
about this office.
How about you?
I feel good, except that says
three stages of pregnancy,
and there's four pictures.
Okay, so this isn't
a math office,
it's a doctor's office.
: I hope that doctors
can do math.
Well, the doctor didn't
make that sign, clearly.
You think the doctor made
the "dirty area" sign?
Oh, hello. ZACH: Hi.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. McCall.
SAMANTHA: Hi. Hey.
Hello. How are you?
I... I'm Zach.
Hi. I'm Dr. Ludka.
It's nice to finally meet.
Finally meet. Yes! Yeah. Yeah.
Hello, lucky lady. Hi.
How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?
Okay. You ready?
Yeah.
Okay, this is gonna be
quick and painless.
ZACH: Awesome.
Sorry. : Awesome.
Um, you know you get a copy
of the ultrasound, right?
ZACH: Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I just, um...
He... This is his thing.
It's our thing. We...
It's our thing.
We just wanted to film
a bunch of this, so he can...
he, she, whoever,
can see it later.
It's for the baby. Okay. Sure.
Is it okay? Oh, yeah. Perfect.
Okay.
Make sure you get my good side.
Done. Done. Right there.
Both sides.
This is gonna be a little cold.
Mm-hmm.
LUDKA: Little gooey, huh?
Yeah. Oh. That's...
great. Okay.
LUDKA: Ah, there we go.
ZACH: Ooh. Can you see?
There's your uterus,
right there.
And there's the heartbeat.
Huh. Um...
ZACH: What?
LUDKA: Oh, don't worry,
don't worry, I'm just
gonna make a few adjustments.
SAMANTHA: Is it okay?
ZACH: Is it...
LUDKA: Uh...
Ah, there we go.
So, you're about
seven weeks along.
ZACH: Ooh. And everything
looks really good.
ZACH: Honeymoon baby.
The pill's about 99% effective,
but occasionally this happens.
Okay. Don't even...
She winked at me.
I saw that. I...
'Cause I got good sperm.
What? It's good, strong sperm.
This is what you've started.
I'm gonna prescribe
vitamin B...
and iron, since
you're a vegetarian.
Mm-hmm. ZACH: Yeah, I've been
trying to break her of that.
LUDKA: Yeah. It's for the baby.
Mm-mm.
But overall, you're pretty healthy.
Yeah.
I'm expecting
a pretty smooth ride here.
ZACH: Awesome. SAMANTHA: Great.
Okay? ZACH: Thank you. Yeah.
One more thing.
ZACH: What? Ooh. Oh.
Congratulations.
The due date is March 30.
ZACH: Hey, it looks like a...
he looks like you.
: He doesn't.
A little jelly bean.
Ooh, will you hold this?
LUDKA: Oh, sure.
It's our first family video.
LUDKA: Oh, sweet.
: That's awesome.
Sorry, sorry. Thanks.
LUDKA: All right, expecting
you guys back in five weeks.
I think Maverick drank my wine.
SAMANTHA:
Aw, Mav. He's such a lush.
ZACH: Hey, are your...
like, ankles and toes
started swelling up?
SAMANTHA:
Oh, my God, with the ankles.
Yes, they're swelling up. Yeah.
I read in the baby book,
it says that those things
swell sometimes.
They do. My entire thing
is swelling right now, so...
Looks-looks good.
You could use a little
meat on your bones. Mm-mm.
I don't like it.
Hey, ew. I mean, whoa.
: Excu... What?
Oh, God.
You haven't noticed that?
No. What is that? I don't...
Oh. Does it hurt?
No. I think my body's
being taken over by hormones.
Ugh! This is not supposed
to be happening.
Yeah, don't look at that. No,
no, that is supposed to...
All these weird things
are gonna happen to you.
You're making a-a person...
Yeah. Inside of your person.
:
Seriously, it's amazing.
Sam.
Hm?
You're making a baby.
I can't do that.
Yeah.
ZACH: Oh, she woke you up?
Yeah. So, your mother snores,
even though she
categorically denies it.
But we now have hard evidence,
so if she ever denies it ag...
Oh, hey.
Sam.
Sam, hey.
Jesus, Sam...
Sam...
Go to sleep.
ZACH: What are you doing?
Hello.
ZACH: All right,
they're getting restless,
they're getting restless,
so let's, uh...
I'll leave it to Sam.
We're having a baby.
Oh, my God!
Oh, that's great!
They're having a baby! What?
Congratulations. We get
to be grandparents again!
Aw. Stop, okay? Thank you.
Congratulations.
Flip it.
Flip that card that you
just had in your hand.
Thank you.
Seven, king... so I get it.
It's tofu. ZACH: What
did you think it was?
I wish you wouldn't have
told me it was tofu.
I mean, did they do a sonogram?
Oh, yeah. Did you get...
did you get a picture?
Yeah. She wants, like, a
picture to show everybody,
like, immediately.
Ultra... oh, ultrasound.
If you go with a C-section, your
body just bounces right back.
Oh, really. Great. What?
Sweetie... Did you... why
don't you try to not, like,
micromanage their
entire... thing.
I checked under the fridge...
it's not there.
You lifted
the fridge up and...?
Well, I mean,
I looked... Whatever.
We'll find it. We'll find it.
Uh, I couldn't find it. I'll...
When I do, I'll
e-mail it to you.
Oh, I hope you find it, 'cause...
We will, we will.
I'm sorry, Nat.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
Oh, my God, Sam,
you're bleeding.
SAMANTHA: Oh, God.
Oh, geez. Here.
Sam, here you go.
This is clean.
Tilt your head back.
SAMANTHA: Oh. Ugh! Ew.
SUZIE: Are you okay?
ZACH: This is where
you'll go to school.
I got beat up here
a couple times,
but that's not
gonna happen to you.
You're gonna be
a much cooler kid.
Uh, this is where
me and your mom got married.
Very pretty church.
This is where we walk the dog.
Here's the Anderson house.
It still looks like shit.
Shit, fuck, Maverick.
Maverick, goddamn.
Hey, hey. Maverick.
Come here. Hey.
Hey. No, no.
No, no, we don't live here.
Come on.
All right, come on.
Come on.
This is your house.
That's your room
up there on the left.
Granddad says that
it's a money pit, but, uh...
you know, it's got good...
good bones. Shit.
Hey.
Hey. Do you think
this looks too mishmash?
Um...
do you want the truth?
I'm giving our baby
a tour of the house.
Yeah? Hey! Sorry.
That's not the house.
ZACH: And the grand finale...
your room!
Formerly known
as your mother's office.
But now we are converting.
Thank you for
giving up your office.
Mm-hmm. Whoa!
: Watch it there.
SAMANTHA: Geez!
I mean, I study on the couch
all the time anyway, so...
it's not a big deal.
It's a pretty good room, though.
She really didn't do anything
in it, so I think it's...
it's only fair.
It's gonna be
kind of cool, though...
you and I are
gonna hang in here...
Hey. Teach you...
Do you see this guy
across the street?
Huh? He's just, like,
staring up at the house.
ZACH: What? What the fuck?
SAMANTHA: Oh, it's creepy.
ZACH: Hey. Hi.
How was class? Ow!
Uh, it was fine. I just had
to leave 'cause I'm starving.
I think there's some
leftover pad Thai in there.
I know. I don't want that.
Okay.
Um... I'm just gonna eat
a bunch of cookies.
How are you...
how are you feeling?
Fine.
I'm just hungry.
MAN: You're okay?
All right.
All right, get ready!
SAMANTHA: Oh! What?
Whoa, whoa. Hey, no.
Hello? SAMANTHA: Hey.
I told you not...
that this was off-limits
until I told you
that it was on-limits.
But it's just Emily.
I want her to see it.
EMILY: It looks so good.
I don't care abut Emily.
I care about you. Oh. Okay.
EMILY: Uh-oh. Great.
Thanks. Are you guys gonna
pick a color, or...
Well, one of these days.
This looks really good, though.
Oh, look!
Oh, my God. ZACH: Yep.
SAMANTHA: That's really nice.
EMILY: You made that?
ZACH:
It's gonna look way better.
SAMANTHA:
Well, you're doing a great job.
I'm very proud of you.
Well, here's the crib.
Uh-huh. Hey... EMILY: Oh, wow.
ZACH: Yeah.
That looks really good.
Yeah, I got it... we got it
at the antique place,
and then I brought it home
and, uh, you know,
sanded it down,
refinished it and stuff,
made it baby-safe... I know
you're big on baby safety.
Yeah. Well, it looks great.
EMILY : Cute sheets.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
ZACH: I got you.
Okay, okay, hey. I got you.
Oh, ow, ow, ow.
Sit down.
You okay?
EMILY: It happened
this morning, too.
Did... This bad?
Mm-hmm.
Hey. Hey. Just breathe, okay?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
EMILY: Lie down, maybe?
You sure it's just...
I'll just sit here for a second.
In.
And out.
In.
: Do you see
what I'm doing for you?
I'm learning how to breathe.
: You might actually
have to know some of this stuff.
I know this stuff.
I know how to breathe.
Okay. I know that
you know how to breathe,
but there's other stuff...
Okay.
: Stop.
INSTRUCTOR: You are strong.
You are healthy.
Your body is going through
a beautiful transformation.
SAMANTHA :
That's a load of shit.
INSTRUCTOR: I want you all
to imagine a place
that's calming...
quiet.
Make it a specific memory.
Where are you?
SAMANTHA :
On the beach on our honeymoon.
INSTRUCTOR: How old are you?
Are you alone?
Breathe in to this memory
that brings you joy.
INSTRUCTOR: Okay,
everyone please breathe.
Breathe. If you're gonna sit up,
sit up slowly.
Very slowly.
Keep breathing, everyone.
ZACH: Hey, Sam. Sam.
Please remain calm.
Sam, are you okay?
So, this is happening.
SAMANTHA: Yep.
We are buying baby stuff.
Baby stuff!
Let's go crazy.
Yeah, let's go nuts.
Ooh. You want to...
You want to practice
a little diapering,
get a little wrap
around this guy?
I'm-I'm good.
You don't want to do that?
I'm good.
But he's just been out,
he's not even in a box...
he's clearly dirty.
Yeah, where'd
this baby come from?
I don't know you, baby.
: You bent him over
and looked at his ass
to see where it came from.
I just wanted to know
if he had a name or something.
: It's a milk pump.
Not at all.
No? No.
We need one, though, right?
Yeah, we do.
I actually need one.
I never want to see you
do that ever again.
Probably not.
No, I think we got everything.
For the whole pregnancy.
This is all a baby
needs right here.
Ow! You all right?
I'm gonna
go get the car, all right?
Just hold on. No, I'm fine.
No, seriously, Sam, Sam, please,
just wait there, all right?
SAMANTHA: No. Look,
if I just keep moving,
I'm gonna be completely...
I'll be right there.
ZACH: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, shit! Sam!
SAMANTHA: Motherfucker!
Whoa, hey, hey, no.
MAN: What are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you fucking crazy?!
Stop, stop, stop!
Get away from my car!
It's okay. It's okay.
Okay, okay. We're
gonna get some help.
We're gonna get some help.
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
What happened?! What happened?!
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Oh, what is wrong with me?!
Just breathe. It's okay.
: Something is wrong!
Something is wr...
ZACH: Hey.
You look really pretty
when you're pensive.
I'm serious.
Hey.
Look what I found
behind your ear.
Nothing.
Oh. Hello.
Hi. Hi, Zach.
Hi, Samantha. I'm Dr. Dylan.
ZACH:
Wait, uh, where's Dr. Ludka?
Dr. Ludka had to take
a leave of absence.
I'm covering for her.
Well...
Excuse me. Is she gonna
be back anytime soon?
She filled me in,
and I've studied your file.
Okay. That's it.
ZACH: So, well,
I mean, will she be back
by the time we deliver?
Yeah, can we talk to her?
I don't think she's
gonna be able to come back.
Let's talk about your symptoms.
ZACH: Uh... okay.
Hmm.
Baby looks healthy.
But it's... turned around.
We're not gonna be able to...
find out if it's
a boy or girl today.
ZACH: It's gotten so much bigger.
: Yeah.
Sam, you okay?
ZACH: Oh, geez...
Hey. All right,
all right, right here. Here.
ZACH: She just needs a minute.
Sorry, the nausea
hasn't really gotten better.
It actually... seems like
it's gotten kind of worse.
Well, it's not
entirely unusual, so...
Um...
she's been getting
nosebleeds, too.
Are those... are those...
Yeah, can be.
She just doesn't seem
like herself lately.
Is there a history of mental
illness in her family?
I-I don't know.
Uh... I mean, she took
some meds during college
for... anxiety or...
I don't really know what...
they were.
We don't... uh...
we don't really know anything
about... her family.
Her parents were killed
in a car crash,
and they had
to cut Sam out of her womb.
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
SAMANTHA: Hey. Oh.
ZACH: You look beautiful.
SAMANTHA: I'm really sorry.
ZACH: It's all right.
DYLAN: It's all right.
I, um... I'm gonna
do an amnio now.
Just to rule out any issues.
Especially since you don't know
what may run in your family.
ZACH: Okay.
You all right?
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
I'm good, too.
Good. I was worried about you.
I know. I could tell,
'cause you asked.
Uh, is this gonna hurt?
DYLAN: Oh, it's just
a little pressure.
It'll be over
before you know it.
I need you to stay very still.
Okay. Nurse, watch
the monitor, please.
You ready?
Mm-hmm.
Just relax. Take a deep breath.
Mmm-mm.
ZACH: Are you okay?
No. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey.
It's... N-No, something's wrong.
Can you get it out?
Can you get it out?
Keep her still.
Is everything okay?
No, no.
Mm-mm. Keep her still.
Just try and stay still.
No. Can you get it out?
Samantha, we're almost there.
Can you get it out? Sam, Sam.
We're almost there.
Please get it out! No!
You're gonna hurt yourself.
No! You're gonna hurt yourself.
Get it out!
Sam, please, please, please.
Get it out! Please, can you
get it out of her? Thank you.
Get it out! It's out!
We're all done.
Sam, it's out, it's gone.
It's done, it's done.
Hey, hey, it's done.
Hey, hey, it's okay, all right?
Jesus Christ. It's okay.
: I can't do this.
I can't do this.
It's all right, it's all right.
ZACH: I'm-I'm really
worried about her.
I don't... I don't know
what to do.
Do you think she'd ever
actually hurt herself?
What?
No, I don't...
I don't know. I don't think so.
Just to be safe, we'll be
keeping a close eye on her.
Okay.
ZACH: This door... I'm gonna
fix this door someday.
SAMANTHA:
Yeah, that'll be great.
ZACH: Watch your step.
SAMANTHA :
Okay, thank you.
I'm so glad my sister bought
me that-that flashlight.
Oh.
How are you doing?
I feel like a...
hot air balloon.
You're going upstairs?
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna go
take a bath.
Okay. Yeah.
I'm just gonna check the score
on the game real quick.
All right.
Yeah, this thing takes
forever to turn on.
:
We need to get a fucking maid.
Oh, look.
ZACH: Oh.
SAMANTHA: That's beautiful.
ZACH: Wow.
Nice.
Do you want to, like,
take off while we wait
for the results?
Just go...
I don't know,
a spa or just get out?
Like, let's just get
out of town.
It's a good idea. I... Yeah.
I'm just thinking, though,
you-you've already taken
so much time off of work,
and I've got finals,
and we should probably be close
to the doctor right now.
All right.
It's just a thought.
It's a good thought.
I'm gonna be all right.
I know.
SAMANTHA: Come here.
ZACH: Here we go.
SAMANTHA: Hold on a second.
Okay.
ALL: Surprise!
Oh, my... Oh, my God.
Oh.
ZACH'S MOTHER: Hi.
Hey, sweetheart,
happy birthday, darling.
Wow, thank you.
Great, son. How are you?
I'm very well, thank you.
Hi, Ma. Come here, sweetheart.
GIRL: Yeah. Yeah.
Happy birthday, Aunt Sam.
Oh, my gosh.
Thanks, sweetie.
Happy birthday!
ZACH: All right, that's...
All right, Jim. That's it.
No, I'm fine,
I just got to rest.
You sure? Yeah.
EMILY: Why are you guys
hiding in the corner?
Hey.
Looking good! Thank you.
Um, she's just gonna
go upstairs for a little bit,
take a rest.
Yeah, I got to lie down.
I'll be... I'll be back. Oh.
You okay? All right, I'll
come up in a little bit
and check on you. All right.
I just need a few minutes.
Man, I'll clean all this up.
No, I think that's what
they do actually.
No, no, I got it, I got it.
I'll help you.
I'm gonna help you, too,
I was just going to...
It's fine, I got it.
You guys got everyone here.
I'll clean it all up.
That's no problem.
That's what friends are for.
Can I have some cake?
Yeah, here you go.
Is this too big a bite? No.
There you go. Oh, that's cute.
Mmm, nice. We're the sweetest.
We're so cute.
How's, um, how's Sam?
Uh, I don't... I don't know.
I haven't been up there
since she went up, but, um,
she just, honestly,
like, in general,
has not been herself or right.
I mean, and the doctor says
that everything's fine,
and we've done, like,
all these tests,
and she's just
kind of convinced
that there's something wrong
with the baby.
Like, she's adamant about it.
Well...
WOMAN: How's everything going?
MAN:
Thank you, Hey, you know what...
LITTLE GIRL: Braedan.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Braedan?
Come on, I know you're in here.
Braedan?
Braedan?
Braedan, come out.
It's not funny anymore.
Braedan?
Get out!
ZACH: I just saw you move.
All right, come on.
Do it again, here.
Lift this back
so we can see you.
All right, buddy, let's go.
You're sleeping
like your lazy mother.
Yeah.
Lazy bones.
It's all right.
All right, shh.
Mav, hey.
Hey.
I mean, you know, we talked
about the summer courses,
so I figured I'd just get
a couple of classes going
and then go back
to the full load in the fall.
You don't want to just
wait till the fall?
No, I don't.
I don't want to just wait
until the fall.
Well, um...
I-I...
Okay, I was just
thinking 'cause...
I know, it's just
that this has come up and I...
No, I know, but the baby...
the baby's coming in-in March.
I know it's not gonna
be easy, but I just...
I don't want to put everything
on hold just to, like...
No, we're not putting everything on...
Well, it is.
I mean, it's not
on hold indefinitely.
But, like, I got to keep
working, and then...
Yeah, but if it stops,
if I stop doing it now,
then I'd just feel like
I'm not gonna be able
to start back up again.
Like, I'm gonna be
stuck in this house,
and I'm gonna become some housewife.
No, you're not
gonna be... You're not...
S-Sam, Sam.
Then I'm gonna turn
into your sister.
I'm gonna be Natalie.
No, you're not...
And I don't want to be her.
Sam, you're not
gonna be Natalie. It's you and me.
Well...
It's Zach and Sam, all right?
That's what it's turning into.
I know that, but
I don't want to...
This isn't what I wanted
to begin with, okay?
I didn't want to get pregnant,
and now I am and I just want
life to go back to normal.
Can you just... Okay, well...
I don't want to talk
about it anymore,
and my fucking hair
is falling out, okay?
Sam, whoa!
Hey. ZACH: Hi.
Are you excited? Yeah.
Yeah, why?
'Cause today's
my first Communion.
Oh, shoot, my bad.
SUZIE: I don't know, you guys.
I went to church like once.
Oh, you look like a princess.
Hey. MAN: Brittany,
give your aunt a hug.
Oh, hi.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
MAN: What's wrong, sweetie?
Thank you. How are you feeling?
Well, well, well, you ready
for your big day, young lady?
You've got the
whole family here.
Yeah. All right.
Hey, hello, Sam.
Oh, hi. How are you doing?
I'm doing well.
How are you? Good.
I'm good, really.
Yeah. Are you all right?
So, when is the little one due?
ZACH: Uh, one month.
One more month.
One month. That's good.
Are you all right? Yeah.
Hey, do you want a bottle
of water or something?
No, I'll be fine.
One month, that's all.
Home stretch, right? Yeah.
I've just got something in my throat.
Well...
I'm so sorry. Do you... Yeah.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Bye.
MAN:
We'll see you inside, I guess.
CHOIR:  Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to thee
Holy, holy, holy
Merciful and mighty
God in three persons
Blessed Trinity.
I think that's
the nicest procession
I've ever seen.
Boys and girls,
we are so proud of you.
And we are so happy
to have you here
this morning,
on this big, important
day in your lives.
Newest members of our church
to gather round
for the Liturgy
of the Eucharist.
We are here
to celebrate with you today
your first Holy Communion.
Also, the first time
you receive
our Lord Jesus Christ
into your souls.
The...
I, uh...
Excuse me.
Uh, this-this sacrament...
It is a sacrament...
MAN: Father Thomas, you okay?
WOMAN: Father Thomas?
WOMAN: Father! Oh, my God.
Where-where was I?
Father Thomas!
Do you need help?
He needs help!
MAN: It's okay,
Father, it's okay.
We'll call 911.
Father, are you okay?
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas.
ZACH: Hey, whoa, Sam.
Hey, hey, stop, stop, Sam.
Look, it's-it's me.
Sto... Hold on.
Sam, s-stop, stop!
All right, hey,
it's okay, calm...
SAMANTHA: I don't remember
what happened back there.
With Father Thomas.
Did I...
I mean, did I do that to him?
What?
No.
Hey.
: What the fuck
is wrong with me?
No.
ZACH :
Hey, hey, stop, stop, Sam.
It's-it's me, it's Zach.
Hold on, stop, s-stop, stop.
All right, hey.
It's okay. Zach?
Let's just go,
let's just go home.
FATHER THOMAS:
Oh, I'm so sorry, where was I?
I... This-this...
FATHER THOMAS:
...Jesus Christ into your soul.
Almighty
Early in the morning
Our...
born from death.
ZACH: This little guy.
SAMANTHA: Hey, little guy.
SAMANTHA: Yeah, I hear it.
Zach... This is...
No, Zach, come on, le..
SAMANTHA:
These men are staring at me.
ZACH: What?
I said, "These men
are staring at me."
Hey, babe, let's put it away.
ZACH: Come on. SAMANTHA: No.
ZACH: Yes.
I'm sorry, but we got to get up.
SAMANTHA: Ugh.
I'm so hungover.
ZACH: Yeah, no kidding.
SAMANTHA :
Oh, God, get away with that.
Hey, Mason, it's Zach.
I know, but come on...
Um... I'll get you some water,
but we got to get up;
We got to catch this plane.
Um, can-can you come over
for a little bit?
I need to talk to you
about something.
SAMANTHA: Okay. Thanks.
And-and just, um,
I-I'll meet you outside,
in front of the house, okay?
I don't want to...
I don't want to bother Sam.
Okay.
How did we get home last night?
ZACH: I don't know,
the guy in the cab, I think?
ZACH: What the fuck?
SAMANTHA : Stop.
Not right now.
He was, like, our cab
driver, on our honeymoon.
So I came home and, like,
looked at all the tapes,
and there's all this
mystery fucking...
Look at this. You sure, man?
Maybe it's some weird shit they
do down there to scare tourists.
Whoa, what the fuck?
What the fuck?
What? It's gone.
I, uh...
What are you talking about?
I-I was j... literally
just looking at this shit
right before you...
I was literally
just looking at this
right before you just came in,
and now it's-it's-it's gone.
It's empty.
The fucking... It's gone.
The fucking tape is gone now.
I mean, y-you... Fuck!
Why don't you just take a...
take a breath, man, you know?
No, I don't need to do that.
I don't need to take a...
Wait, hold on.
What the fuck!
NURSE:
We've been monitoring him 24-7.
ZACH: Uh, do you think
I can talk to him privately?
NURSE: If he needs anything,
we'll be right outside.
ZACH:
Father Thomas, how are you?
I had a small stroke.
Yeah, we heard.
Are you going to be...
you going to be all right?
How... how is Sam?
Um, she's... she's okay.
That's actually kind of
why I wanted to...
I'm glad that she's okay.
Talk to you.
Um, I...
I saw these weird symbols
on our honeymoon.
And, um, I just don't know
really what they are,
and I thought you might
'cause...
I don't know, I think
everything I've seen
says they're, uh,
religious symbols.
So, uh, look, um,
there's these ones, and then...
there's that.
I-I mean, there's a bunch more.
I just started...
I mean, these are
the only ones I've
actually seen in person.
The other ones were all just
kind of linked to it
when I started looking...
John... First John.
What?
First John 2:18.
"Children, this is
the last hour.
"You have been told
the antichrist is coming,
"and so there are many
that are coming,
"and that... that is
how we know it is the...
the last hour."
Uh, what are you...
what are you talking about?
These are from early,
early religion.
These are... early religion.
There's a sect, dissident.
They tried to bring the Church
down in its early days,
and they did... they did rites,
and they used those symbols.
They... they painted them
on the point of entry
and on the nest.
The point of conception
and the point of... of birth.
What? So that he could get in.
And there was ash all around.
There was ash everywhere.
The antichrist is coming.
So will there be many
antichrists,
and that is how we know
it is the last hour.
They will be coming.
Okay, I-I didn't mean
to upset you. I'm really...
It's the last hour. I'm really sorry.
I, uh...
I don't think you can be here
with that anymore.
You have to go now. O-Okay.
I need you to go now, Zach.
Yeah.
I'm very, very tired,
and I need you to go.
Okay.
Put that away. Don't-don't...
Don't use that.
It's gone. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
You've upset me. Just go.
All right. Go.
I hope you feel better.
Now! Go!
Okay. All right.
ZACH: Nurse? Nurse, can you...
Um, this one's from you, Em...
This is from Emily.
Can everybody... Thank you.
Oh, yay!
More... more to come.
That's just a taste.
SUZIE: You're going to eat...
Okay, this...
Whose is this one?
This... I don't know.
That doesn't...
doesn't have a name.
Does anybody... Does this...
this be-belong to anybody?
Well... anonymous.
It's nameless. Anon.
EMILY: You're just getting
gifts from everywhere.
SUZIE: Sorry,
whoever this is from.
Brooke!
What a sweetheart, Brooke!
I didn't read the note,
so I don't know
what's happening.
EMILY: That's nice of you.
SUZIE: Well, you know, keep it.
NATALIE: Sam, you okay?
ZACH: How was...
how was the shower?
SAMANTHA: Fine.
Did you hear that?
ZACH: Fuck.
Every window in the house,
but a lot of them in these...
This is really mostly
where I see it, so I don't...
what should...
I-I don't know what to do.
You know, I have
to admit, it is, uh...
it's kind of weird.
No, it's-it's-it's...
I mean, someone
was in here, all right?
Someone broke into our house,
and they put this shit...
Wait, hold on a second.
Did, uh...
But look at the porch. I mean...
OFFICER :
I mean, wait a second here.
Was anything stolen? ZACH: No.
No, not tonight, but, um...
But no break-in?
No break-in?
There is a break-in.
Like, someone came in
and put this here,
so they... broke in.
I mean, they don't have
to physically
break something, do they?
Well... no, no.
Around the house, there's
no evidence of a break-in.
ZACH: You know, we usually
lock the doors,
so I really don't know
how anyone got in here.
OFFICER: Sir, there's nothing
I can do right now.
I can file a report.
And call us if there's
any other problems.
That's all I can do for now.
Now, you have a nice night.
STEVE: Okay, here we go.
JAY: Nice.
JAY: Here he goes. Watch this.
ASHLEY:
You're going to break your neck.
JAY: Ah-ah-ah.
JAY: Oh, he got it! No way!
ASHLEY : Wow.
STEVE: Fuck that.
I'm so impressed.
Check this out.
What's up?
JAY: Here, take this.
I got to take a piss. Oh, fuck.
I'm out.
STEVE: All right. Be careful.
ASHLEY: Taking a break?
Do you want to come?
Will you hold it for me?
No, she doesn't want to.
Since Jay's gone...
do you want to, like, uh...
JAY : Hey, guys,
you got to come see this!
What is he doing? Fucker.
STEVE: You're fucking me up.
Look what I caught.
ASHLEY: What is that?
STEVE: Oh, fuck.
ASHLEY: What the fuck?
JAY: Dinner is served, y'all.
ASHLEY: Jay, stop.
STEVE: Oh, what in the fuck?
ASHLEY: That is so gross.
Please don't... don't touch it.
STEVE:
Jay, what did you do to it?
ASHLEY: Oh, it fucking stinks!
Hey, take a photo.
ASHLEY: Oh, my God.
I'm taking a video, jackass.
It smells like shit.
STEVE: Hey, touch it
and see if it's still warm.
ASHLEY: Hey.
You guys, there's
something over there.
JAY: Ah!
STEVE: You're so fucked-up.
ASHLEY: Look!
Do y'all see that?
JAY: Shut up. STEVE: What?
ASHLEY: Wait.
STEVE: Yo.
JAY: Hey.
ASHLEY: What is she doing?
STEVE: Hey, Ash, stay back.
JAY: Ma'am, are you okay?
STEVE:
What the fuck is she doing?
JAY: What the fuck?
ASHLEY: Oh, my God.
STEVE: Oh, shit.
ASHLEY:
Uh, ma'am, are you okay?
JAY: Oh! What the fuck?
Run!
Steve! Steve!
STEVE: Come on, man! Get up!
Get up, dude!
STEVE: Oh, what the fuck?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Shit.
No!
: No...!
Oh, fuck.
ZACH: Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
Actually, I feel
a little bit better.
Good.
Um, do you need anything?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Good.
ZACH: Sam?
Sam?
Hey.
Sam.
What... Hey.
What are you doing?
Sam.
Hey.
What's going on?
You okay?
Sam, what the fuck is going on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look, hey.
Don't touch us!
Sam, it's just me, all right?
It's just me.
Hey. Stop, stop, stop,
stop it, Sam.
Sam, it's okay, it's okay.
I think you're dreaming.
It's okay.
Hey, stop. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's me. No, it's me.
Yeah. Yeah. Zach?
I got you. I got you.
It's me.
It's all right. I'm right here.
See? See, look.
It's just me. It's just me.
Okay?
You okay?
It's okay. It's okay.
What's happening?
Nothing.
You just had a dream.
It's okay.
That's okay.
ZACH'S FATHER :
...home, so please leave us
a message and we'll call
you back as soon as we can.
Hey, Dad, um, it's Zach.
Uh, look, I think Sam and I
need to come over and stay
with you and... and Mom.
Sam's really freaking out,
and it's gotten me
really scared and-and...
It-it's just not normal, okay?
And I know this sounds
really crazy, but I-I swear,
there's been people
watching us or...
We just don't want
to be alone, okay?
I think we'd just feel
a lot better
if we were...
we were with you and Mom.
So, uh, call me back.
Fuck.
Hey. Hey!
ZACH: Oh. Hey.
Hi. Hi.
Uh, thanks for coming over.
Sam's... Sam's upstairs.
She's sleeping.
She feeling okay?
Yeah, she's fine. I just...
um, I just need to
take off for a minute.
I didn't want her to wake up
and have no one be here,
all right?
Okay. Where you going?
Just don't answer the door.
Okay. Bye.
Weirdo.
Hmm.
SUZIE: Sam?
Sam?
Hey, Sam?
Hey.
Sam?
Samantha?
Sam?
Samantha?
Sam, Jesus, what are you doing?
Sam, hey... hey!
Give this to me.
Stop, stop, stop!
Sam? Stop!
Give this to me!
Sam! Sam, stop!
ZACH: Fuck.
Shit.
ZACH : Fuck.
ZACH: Fuck! Shit!
Oh, shit!
WOMAN:
ZACH: I just need some help.
Something is happening
to my wife.
Just, please, send someone over.
WOMAN: What's the address?
ZACH: 901 Harrison Street.
Please... please...
WOMAN:
Sir, I'm sorry, I can't un...
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?
ZACH: What do you want?
Leave us the fuck alone!
SAMANTHA : No!
ZACH: Sam!
ZACH: Aah! Ah, fuck!
Oh...!
Oh, fuck... okay.
All right.
ZACH: Shit. Fuck.
Okay... oh, fuck.

Oh, God... okay, okay...

Hey...
Hey, Sam, come on! Sam, wha...

What are you doing?
What are you... Please.
No. No, stop, stop it.
Sam, Sam, Sam.
This isn't you. Please.
Please, just come with me.
Please, let's go,
we gotta get out of...
Okay, Su-Suzie?
Suzie? Suzie.
Fuck, no, no.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God... Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
Sam.
Please... it's okay.
Come on, please, please,

Come on, just come

DETECTIVE: So, what did
you do with the baby?
They took it.
DETECTIVE:
And this is the same "they"
who killed your wife
and your sister?
You know, we checked...
the, uh, Anderson house.
It's been abandoned for years.
Completely empty.
And there is no
Dr. Dylan at Willow Oak
or any other hospital
in the area.
Why don't you tell us
what really happened?
Mr. McCall?
WOMAN: Look at it! Oh, my God!
MAN: I got it, sweetie.
That's so amazing.
It's like a dream come true.
Okay, last day of the honeymoon!
MAN: Whoo! Ah!
Paris!
All right,
let's do one together.
Okay. All right.
Why don't we come back
next year, baby?
No, baby, we are gonna come
back every year, all right?
Okay, good. Promise?
It's been awesome, hasn't it?
Best trip ever.
Love you so much.
Oh, love you... love you...
WOMAN: Let's get a taxi.
MAN: You got it. Oh, perfect.
Eh, you want a taxi?
Yes. Please.
Ah. Come on. Yeah.
Get in. Okay.
I take you somewhere fun, eh?
WOMAN: Okay. Yes.
DRIVER: Eh... authentic.
Outside the city, but... whoo!
MAN: All right, good.
WOMAN:
Yeah, let's go somewhere fun.
DRIVER: It's first time here?
WOMAN:
Yeah, it's the first time.
DRIVER: Eh... uh, newlyweds?
WOMAN: Yeah. How'd you know?
Oogum, Oogum, Boogum,
Boogum, Boogum
Now, baby, you're casting
your spell on me
You got me doing funny things
like a clown
A-just look at me
When you wear
your bell-bottom pants
I just stand there
in a trance
Huh, I can't move
You're in the groove
Would you believe,
little girl
That I-I'm crazy 'bout you?
Huh, now go on now
wit' your bad self
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, now, mercy, mercy on me
Huh, all right
When you wear
those big earrings
Long hair, and things
You got style, girl,
that sure is wild
And you wear
that cute trench coat
And you're standing there
posing
You got soul,
you got too much soul
I just says, who got the boo,
says, who got the boo
Says, who got the boo, now,
castin' your spell on me.
Once upon a time
When I was in high school
I was in love with you, lady
And you treated me so cool
I was drivin' a Chevy '72
It had four
on the floor, girl
120, it would do
And I remember
Marvin Gaye singing
"What's going on?"
And there was a war, baby
Somewhere across the sea
I don't want
to go fight, girl
'Cause you really love me
I remember Martin Luther King
Lord, he was the man, babe
That gave us all a dream
And I remember
Marvin Gaye singing
"What's going on?"
I don't play
with my love, oh, oh
And I remember
Marvin Gaye singing
"What's going on?"
They used to have
sweet music in the park
Lord, up in Monterey, straight
down to the melody bar
You used to wear, girl,
them high pants
And when you strolled
down the hall
All the boys wanted a chance
And I remember
Marvin Gaye singing
"What's going on?"
I don't play with my love,
oh, oh
I remember Otis Redding
Sittin' at the dock
of the bay
But then he went away
And I remember Sam Cooke, oh
Just bring it on home to me
From your love
I can't be free
I remember Elvis Presley
And them blue suede shoes
Lord, they gave me the blues
I remember
Marvin Gaye singing, yeah
"Let's get it on."
