No one who comes here leaves!
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
Is my brother alive?
Yeah.
- Hold up!
- Let go of her.
Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.
From the looks of 'em, they
got to be set up pretty good.
I'll find out where.
Merle: You don't even know
why you're here, do you?
I didn't mean you no harm.
I lowered my gun,
but you raised yours.
You were an asshole out there,
just like you were on that
rooftop back there in Atlanta.
What y'all did,
leaving me up there--
people wouldn't
do that to an animal.
We went back for you.
Ain't you thoughtful?
We did, all of us--
Rick, Daryl, T-Dog.
Mm, T-Dog.
Yeah, big ol'
spear-chucker,
the one I was pleading with.
Mm-hmm, the one
that dropped the key.
Tell me where he's at.
I'm sure T-Dog would like
to bury the hatchet,
let bygones be bygones.
He didn't make it.
Well, I hope he went slow.
Yeah.
How about the rest?
Hmm?
How about my baby brother?
You can't tell me he's alive
and then hold off
on where he is.
No?
Well, maybe the farmer's
daughter will help me out.
Merle:
and her trembling skin
is close to you,
here, all over here,
and over here...
feels good, don't it?
I remember you.
Yeah.
You're the sneaky one,
the one with nerve.
You don't scare easy, do you?
I like that.
Now...
I wanna know
where my brother is.
I wanna know
where the sheriff is.
Ah! God!
Ah!
Merle:
where your camp is,
and I wanna know now.
Merle:

Should we help her?
Carl!
Shit.
Is she bit?
Gunshot.
Carl, get a blanket.
Beth, water and a towel.
- All right.
- Here?
She's not coming
in the cell blocks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Steady now.
All right.
All right.
Thank you.
Shh.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.
Who are you?
Hey, it's all right.
Hey. Hey.
No. We're not
going to hurt you
unless you try something
stupid first, all right?
Daryl:
Who the hell is this?
You wanna tell us your name?
You wanna tell us your name?
Daryl:
Everything all right?
You're gonna wanna see this.
Go ahead.
Carl, get the bag.
We'll keep this safe and sound.
The doors are all locked.
You'll be safe here.
And we can treat that.
I didn't ask for your help.
Doesn't matter.
Can't let you leave.
Oh, God.
Thank God.
Thank God.
Thank God.
How?
Solitary.
Poor thing fought her
way into a cell.
Must have passed out.
Dehydrated.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
Everything all right?
I just came to tell you--
Mr. Coleman, he's ready.
Okay, I'll meet you in the lab.
Yes, sir.
- Sorry about that.
- Andrea:
I'll be back.
Actually, I could use your
help with something now.
I said I'll be back.
No.
I wish it were just that.
We can tend
to that wound for you,
give you a little
food and water,
and then send you on your way.
But you're gonna have
to tell us how you found us
and why you were
carrying formula.
The supplies were dropped
by a young Asian guy
with a pretty girl.
Rick:
What happened?
Were they attacked?
- They were taken.
- Taken? By who?
By the same son of a
bitch who shot me.
Hey, these are our people.
You tell us what happened now!
Don't you
ever touch me again!
You'd better start talking.
You're gonna have a much bigger
problem than a gunshot wound.
Find 'em yourself.
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Put it down.
You came here for a reason.
There's a town.
Woodbury.
About 75 survivors.
I think they were taken there.
A whole town?
It's run by this guy who
calls himself the Governor--
pretty boy, charming,
Jim Jones type.
He got muscle?
Paramilitary wannabes.
They have armed sentries
on every wall.
- You know a way in?
- The place is secure from walkers,
but we could slip
our way through.
How'd you know how to get here?
They mentioned a prison,
said which direction it was in,
that it was a straight shot.
This is Hershel,
He'll take care of that.
I gotta hand it to you,
a lot tougher than I remember.
No surprise
you lasted this long.
Shoot, I figured the way Officer
Friendly abandoned people,
he would have
left you behind by now.
But he didn't do that, did he?
It's just a matter of time
before they come looking.
I'll bake a cake
with pink frosting.
Would they like that?
Ain't nobody coming.
Rick is.
- And when he gets here--
-
not if he wants you
and Bo Peep back.
Think I'm in this by myself?
You can't take us all.
There's too many of us.
There ain't a pair
of nuts between
the whole pussy lot of you.
We've been on the road,
not hiding in some dungeon.
Rick, Shane, Dale, Jim, Andrea.
Really?
Thank you.
Oscar: How do you know
we can trust her?
Beth: This is Maggie and Glenn.
Why are we even debating?
Daryl: We ain't.
I'll go after them.
Rick: Well, this place
sounds pretty secure.
- You can't go alone.
- I'll go.
Me, too.
I'm in.
I got the flash bangs
and I got the tear gas.
You never know
what you're gonna need.
Hey.
Hey, don't you worry
about your old man.
I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
- Wasn't this place overrun?
- It was.
And you cleared it out
all by yourselves?
Just the few of you?
There were others.
Carl.
- What you did for Mom--
- I had to.
I know, and I'm sorry.
No one should have
to go through that.
How long will you be gone?
Look, if something happens
while we're gone--
We'll be all right.
If anything happens,
you get everyone
locked in the cells,
keep them all safe.
- I will.
-
I know you will.
Take care of your sister,
all right?
Daryl's been calling her
Ass-Kicker.
Ass-Kicker?
I've been thinking, what
should we really call her?
What do you think?
Remember my third grade
teacher, Mrs. Mueller?
Of course.
Her first name was Judith.
Do you think
that's a good name?
I think that's--
that's a fine name.
Judith it is.
Stay safe.
Nine lives, remember?
Bring them back.
Or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble
Hey.
Mr. Coleman,
this is Andrea.
Milton will bring you
up to speed.
I'll see you for dinner.
Thank you for this.
You're doing us
a great service.
- So, what exactly are you--? - Could you
cue up the first song on the record?
Sure.
On my mark.
My name is Milton Mamet.
Please raise your
right hand off the bed
if you recognize any of the
following statements to be true.
You were married
to Betty Coleman.
Your children were
Michael Jr. and Emily.
Very good.
What did he say?
He asked if I could keep it
playing while we wait.
Run when church bells
All righty, I want you
to imagine how I felt
fighting my way
off that roof--
one hand,
losing blood,
walkers chomping down at me
every step of the way.
Last chance.
Where's your group?
Suit yourself.
But you know
what they say--
he's gonna be hungry
again in an hour.
Go! Run, boy!
Milton: After Mr. Coleman passes,
He'll reanimate.
I'll ask the questions again,
record his responses.
I need you to end the
subject's reanimated state.
All right.
I've been trying
to determine whether
trace memory and human
consciousness exist
after the subject
has transformed,
but I had no baseline
to work off of
till now.
Prostate cancer.
We didn't have the
resources to treat him,
so he volunteered
to be the test subject.
He's been very cooperative.
He's a remarkable man.
You're close?
We spent a lot
of time together.
The song, the singing
bowl, the questions--
we've done that
a few dozen times.
These are cues that
will hopefully linger
in his unconscious mind
even after he's died.
There is no unconscious
mind, Milton.
When they turn,
they become monsters.
That's all.
Whoever they once were is gone.
We'll see.
You haven't seen this
before, have you?
The transformation.
No.
No one in your
family was--?
I'm an only child.
My parents died
when I was young.
Weren't you with anyone
when everything went down?
I telecommuted to work.
I never really...
Chills run up and down my spine...
That all I longed for
So, they know Andrea.
But they don't know she's here.
But they do know your brother.
He does.
But I don't know about her.
I've never seen her before.
Their people may come for 'em.
Maybe.
The kid and Andrea both say
they went back for me.
So what? He won't break,
say where his people are?
Man: He's a tough
son of a bitch.
Picked that walker
apart in minutes.
Maybe a winter in the sticks
put some hair on his balls.
We'll need him for leverage
if his people come.
What you try to kill him for?
- He pissed me off.
- What's the girl say?
I was just about to go
talk to her next.
I'll take care of it.
May I?
Thank you.
We'll take you back
to your people,
explain this was all
just a misunderstanding.
You tell us where they are
and we'll drive you there.
I want to talk to Glenn.
I can't allow that.
Your people are dangerous.
Handcuffed my man to a roof,
forced him to amputate
his own hand.
I don't know
anything about that.
You just tell us where they are
and we'll bring them here.
You'll be safe, I promise.
No?
Fine.
Let's try something else.
Stand up, please.
Stand up.
Take off your shirt.
No.
Take off your shirt
or I'll bring
Glenn's hand in here.
Go on.
So you gonna talk?
You can do whatever
you're gonna do.
And go to hell.
They have patrols.
We're better off on foot.
How far?
Night's coming.
It's a mile, maybe two.
You know, what you did for me,
for my baby, while I was...
working things out--
thank you.
It's what we do.
- Rick.
- Down.
Get in formation.
No gunfire.
Oscar.
There's too many of them.
This way.
Through there.
Come on.
Get the door.
Rick: Keep it down.
Keep it down.
The smell, it's loud.
Oscar:
What the hell is that?
It's got to be a fox
or what's left of one.
I guess Lassie went home.
- Ah! Who the hell are you?
- We don't mean any harm.
- Get outta my house!
- Okay, okay, okay.
We will, but we can't
right now.
- Now!
- Shut him up.
Man:
There are walkers outside.
- I'll call the cops!
- I am a cop.
Now I need you
to lower the gun.
Don't do anything rash.
Everything's fine.
Let's just--
let's just take this
nice and slow, okay?
Look at me.
Hey, hey.
Show me your badge.
All right. It's in my pocket.
It's in my pocket.
Now, I'm just gonna
reach down nice and slow.
Let go!
Let go of me!
I'll kill you, you--
Shut up!
Shut up!
Ah!
Help!
They found me!
- Help me!
- Don't open that door.
Hel--
Remember the Alamo?
Help me with the door.
You've gotta be kidding.
He's dead.
Check the back.
It's clear!
One, two, three.
Shh.
It's happening.
My name is Milton Mamet.
Please raise your right
hand off the bed
if you recognize any of the
following statements to be true.
Your name is Michael Coleman.
You were married
to Betty Coleman.
Your children were Michael Jr. and Emily.
Did you see that?
He responded.
Their fingers move.
That could be anything.
No, he can't raise his hand.
It's the angle.
I want to try again
without the restraints.
- No.
- We may have tethered his consciousness.
-
I know what happens if the subject comes for us.
That's what you're here for.
As soon as we pull the
restraints, he'll lunge.
Please raise
your right hand--
I think I'd like
to record my findings
while they're fresh.
Uh-uh.
- Hey!
- Drop it.
Governor:
We're through with games.
Now one of you is gonna
give up your camp.
- The prison.
- Merle: The one near Nunez?
Governor:
That place is overrun.
We took it.
- How many are you?
- Maggie:
We have 10 now.
whole prison of biters?
Huh?
Hey, hey.
It's all right.
Shh.
It's all right.
Milton:
That's deep in the red zone.
- There's no way only 10--
- So she's lying?
'Cause if she's lying, that
means a pretty sizeable force
has moved into our backyard.
But if she's not,
this group with
your brother at its core
has done something you
told me couldn't be done.
They did it.
Your brother might be out there
right now, searching for them.
Blood is blood, right?
Makes me wonder
where your loyalties lie.
Here.
You two get a small group
and scout this prison.
I want to know exactly
what we're dealing with.
Yeah.
You got it.
That you'd be back.
Everything go all
right with Milton?
What happened?
Mr. Coleman died.
And did Milton find
what he was looking for?
No.
Hey, hey.
Shh.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's over now, huh?
It's all right.
