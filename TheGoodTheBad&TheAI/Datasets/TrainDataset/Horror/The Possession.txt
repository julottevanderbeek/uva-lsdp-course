Move when you got the ball!
Nobody's moving there.
New ball.
We are going to play with this ball.
Practice is the place
it's okay to feel silly.
Alright, you guys.
Run a couple plays.
- In my mind, coach.
- It is in your mind.
One brain! There you go!
That's the way to move it!
You play better with the
invisible than the real ball.
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey, how are you?
You spas.
Yeah, I was there all alone.
-Hi.
-Hey.
I needed work space for the business.
We're up and running.
The jewellery design. I told
you I was getting back into it.
I boxed up your stuff.
Your name's on it.
Don't you think I should
have packed up my office?
...or When You Eat Animals,
You Become One?
...but Stop The Killing
is super catchy.
-Get my message?
-Loud and clear.
Miss Shandy said that if we get
...she will
take it to the principal...
...and they'll consider
meat-free Mondays.
Dad, were all one big
family on this planet...
-Hi, Clyde.
-Hey.
Careful. You are entering
a shoe-free zone.
I know. I got that
sign for Stephanie.
You wouldn't believe
what's dragged indoors.
-Hey!
-Hi.
-Going to a concert.
-Nice.
Wagner? Stephanie loves Wagner,
don't you, dear?
Em's still vegetarian, so keep an eye
on her, and her allergies, please.
And healthy food,
stuff that grows on trees.
-Stephanie...
-Yes?
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Bye, you guys! I love you!
-Bye!
-Brett says I have an overbite.
-Give me a break, your teeth are fine.
Brett's job is to tell
people they have bad teeth.
-It's in the middle of nowhere.
-Isn't it awesome?
Lets get a dog from
the shelter. Please.
You've got to be kidding me.
This does not work on me anymore.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
I think Mom would
really like this house.
Mom and Dad officially
divorced three months ago.
-That's enough.
-Its getting old.
She thinks you're
getting back together.
Em, your mom and I,
we just sort of, uh...
Okay. Then, there you have it.
You know, it’s for the best.
For real?
You're going to blame this on me?
"Walk a little faster,"
said the whiting to the snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us,
and he's treading on my tail."
Make sure Mom doesn't
find out about dinner.
She'll be mad pizza
doesn't grow on trees.
I'll give you $5 if
you don't tell your mother.
-Daddy, can I get this?
-That is a lovely hat.
So we found a couple things.
What's the damage?
-How about 55?
-55.
My daughters cleaned me out.
I have $48.
-We'll put something back.
-Oh, no.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
You're clearing out.
You moving or something?
-No. Some of bills came up.
-Oh.
Look at these carvings.
They're so pretty.
Em, do me a favour and hand
me the screwdriver, please?
But Daddy,
you said you'd get this open.
Well, that's weird.
There aren't any seams.
It means whoever made this
didn't want anybody to open it...
...or they didn't want
anybody to open it easily.
You hear that?
There's something in there.
So somebody had to open it,
once upon a time.
-Daddy, no.
-I have to take it.
-Trevor. Sorry, I missed your calls.
-Daddy.
Thought it was time you come to
North Carolina, discuss your future.
Talking about you moving
up to Division One.
Said the school needs one
of their own to come take the reins.
What can I say?
Hell, yes, I'm interested.
-What's going on?
-I don't know. It wasn't me.
-Dad!
-Hannah! What is it?
-What are you talking about?
-It's under the covers!
-You did that on my bed.
-You told me to kill it.
Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...
Make me a home,
on my own, better make that bedrock
-I feel funny.
-What?
-I feel funny.
-What do you mean?
I know this stuff
with Mom and Dad sucks...
...but we're just the kids,
and they're the adults...
...and we have to go
along with their mistakes.
But you'll feel better if
you just stopped giving a shit.
-I missed you guys.
-I missed you too.
Wow, yes,
the new house has a pizza tree.
-Is Jen's mom coming?
-Oh, yeah.
...and take one of your
allergy pills just in case.
...you'd write the cafeteria
ladies with menu demands.
-Okay.
-Okay.
What's with this guy?
Is he moving in or what?
He's awfully comfortable
in the kitchen.
-In his antiseptic socks.
-At least he's present.
...being in the moment
as opposed to absent.
-Like you.
-I know what it means.
-Don't forget your stuff.
-Fine.
I'll have the university
pick you up when you land.
-Quite the welcome.
-You'll love it.
-Hannah's dance is next week.
-Oh!
-That's cool.
-Are you going to make it?
Mom will be there,
so don't feel obligated.
Are you kidding?
I'll be in the front row.
Hannah, I told you,
your teeth were perfect.
No, you said it was my decision,
and I don't want to be disfigured.
Disfigured?
Who said you were disfigured?
-Is someone in the house?
-Go
It's okay, you guys.
I think we have a raccoon.
Can't you hear me yelling for you?
Breakfast is ready.
First, the announcer comes out and
announces us.
He has the most obnoxious voice.
I don't know why I can't do it.
"...for the most dazzling divas of
dance, who always keep it fierce...
We all wear a ponytail
to look the same...
...because we're the
chorus with the can-can.
-Jen cut her hair. She needs extensions.
-Em, slow down.
-I personally think it's gross.
-Em--
They sweep it into
bins and weigh it...
...then they take it to
a place where they make wigs...
-I'm really sorry!
-Go to your room.
I had no idea moths were
attracted to pizza and soda.
The pest control
guy can take care of it.
-Want me to take care of it?
-Yes, please.
-How was Wagner?
-It was good. Interesting.
"Interesting" is code
for you fell asleep.
-No, I didn't.
-You totally felt asleep.
That was the weekend the
kids were in camp, remember?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Did you sleep okay?
-I did. It's a little hot in here.
-Nice legs, I'll give you that.
-Oh, God.
-What?
-Nothing. Never mind.
Have you noticed anything
odd going on with Emily?
She has these moments
where she just checks out.
It will be a while before
anything's normal again, right?
-Okay. I'll see you soon.
-Okay.
Where's the communication?
I don't hear anything out here.
Hustle or we're staying
and running lines.
Let's go.
Let's move.
-What time is it?
-Past that.
Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...
Hannah, I'm so sorry
I missed your performance.
I screwed up. I promise,
I'm going to make it up to you.
Because I am the only one
who can touch it.
-Goodnight, Daddy.
-Goodnight, baby girl.
Give it back to me!
Give it back to me!
Emily has displayed some
unusual behaviour the past few weeks.
She is becoming distant
from her friends...
She has lost interest in things
that were once so important to her.
-You moved recently.
-Yeah, I moved.
...the same house they
grew up in most of the time.
Things are fine.
Fine, given the circumstances.
We're divorced. That's always
tough on the kids, isn't it?
I think it would benefit Emily to
talk to someone about her feelings.
I talk to her about her feelings
all the time. About everything.
Still, she seems
extremely frustrated.
That just doesn't
sound like Emily at all.
We've been separated
for a year with no problems.
This behaviour,
something else is going on here.
Still getting your email. It's your
flight details to North Carolina.
-I was going to tell you.
-When? After you took the job?
If they offer it,
you going to take it?
-Of course you are.
-Wait.
Stay oblivious. It seems to
be working well for you.
So, Em, do you understand
why school was cancelled today?
That's right. She was in
a horrible accident last night.
Can you get my box for me?
It's still in the classroom.
Let's talk about
this for a second, okay?
...I noticed sometimes
you talk to it.
-Your friend?
-What?
-You said you talk to your friend.
-Mm-hmm.
-What?
-He lives in there?
-I'm calling Mom.
-And tell her what?
-To pick me up.
-That's not happening.
And if you keep talking to me like this,
you're grounded for the rest of the weekend.
- Go to your room.
- I don't love you.
-Emily...
-And Mommy doesn't love you.
-You think you know everything,
but you don't. -Emily, knock it off.
He does nice things for her!
Something you never did.
Ow! Daddy!
What are you doing to me. Daddy?
-What are you doing, Dad?
-I'm not doing anything!
-Did you hit her?
-No, I didn't hit her!
Because my dad doesn't...
my dad doesn't like me anymore.
The judge reviewed everything and is
granting the interim temporary order.
Based on Mrs. Brenek's report
about the bruise marks...
This is ridiculous.
You know I would never hit her.
-Wait, wait. Stephanie.
-Mr. Brenek!
Can we talk? Just the two of us?
We can work this out, Stephanie.
Mr. Brenek!
You can state your case--
I'm not talking to you!
I'm talking to my wife!
-Stephen--
-Don't touch me!
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?
You destroyed us,
but I won't let you hurt the children.
He's clearly unstable.
He's angry and he's confused.
He's taking this divorce
out on everyone around him.
I thought we'd all
have a movie night.
Watch something funny.
Lighten the mood.
That's your second glass.
Save some for dinner?
What's in your hand?
Come on.
That's just it.
I have no idea what I've got here.
From the woodwork, I'd say
it was from Poland, 1920s, '30s.
...indicated by these
Hebrew inscriptions.
It's the Hebrew word
for "dislocated spirit."
So was it used for
something religious?
The more traditional
branches of Judaism,
...believe in various spirits,
both benevolent and, um...
-Benevolent and--
-Evil. Like demons.
A debunk box was
made with the belief...
...that the evil itself
could somehow be contained.
If you believed such a thing,
that you could trap a demon.
And now,
it's in your hands, Coach Brenek.
Whoever made this box certainly
had intense convictions.
It's why they concealed
this lock and carved these words.
-What are you doing here?
-Where's your sister?
I'm not screwing around.
I need to see Emily.
She decided to stay home.
She's not feeling very well.
"Whoever sits in the
refuge of the most high...
"...he shall dwell in
the shade of the Almighty.
"...He is my refuge,
my fortress, my God.
"For He will deliver
you from the ensnaring trap...
and beneath His wings
you will be protected.
You shall not fear
the terror of night, nor--"
What do you want with
my little girl?
Get out of the house!
I'll call the police. Get out!
One bright morning
when my work is over
My name is Clyde Brenek.
I'm looking for Tzadok Shapir.
-We talked on the phone.
-Thanks for meeting me.
All right. I'll take you
to see my father the Rebbe Shapir...
Alright.
Everyone's waiting in the shul.
My father asks if you could show
what's in the bag.
What does this thing
want with my daughter?
The debunk looks for innocence.
A pure soul.
It will move back
and forth from the box...
The host begins to hear voices...
experience visions.
All of this is the
deception of the spirit...
...to protect the host
and drive others away.
The final stage is when the
debunk attaches to the host....
It will feed and take
until there is nothing left.
It wants only one thing--
that which it does not have.
...is by commanding it
back into the box by its name.
This is what I have.
I need your help.
The debunk could come upon anyone
attempting to perform the ceremony.
When I look at her,
it's this thing looking back at me.
But my little girl,
Emily, she's in there, right?
If this were your child, would
you leave it to the will of God?
Pikuach nefesh. A permitted
violation of a Shabbat law.
A human life is in danger. I am not
only allowed, but required to act.
-Emily, what are you doing?
-Em's not here!
It's okay, baby.
Come here. Come here.
You just stop this right now.
Come here. Come to Mommy.
With everything going on,
we need to have her see someone.
She's a mental health specialist.
She works with kids all the time.
Spend a couple days,
give her a full evaluation.
You could tell Em that we're just
going away for the weekend.
-Hannah!
-What's going on?
If the spirit was contained,
it would have to look upon itself...
...to be forever reminded
it turned away from God.
I'd like to schedule
an MRI right away.
Emily, we're going to
slide you into this machine.
Think of it as a big camera.
Let's us take a look inside.
-Am I okay?
-Yeah, baby.
Everything's going to be all right.
Don't be afraid. Okay?
You'll hear noises, Emily.
It's nothing to be scared of.
What's happening?
Is she all right in there by herself?
She's fine.
Get somebody else up here.
-Dad, I'm so sorry.
-No.
The doctors,
they can't help us, can they?
This is Tzadok.
Tzadok, this is my family.
-Can you help us?
-Of course.
It doesn't want me here.
We need a private place.
There's a therapy room down there.
My players use it sometimes.
-Light these candles.
-How many?
Put something from
your heart in the box.
Once we begin,
we must complete the ceremony.
The debunk will do
everything it can to stop us.
Even in the face of evil,
our faith must remain unwavering.
-Okay.
-Please, God.
Oil of two olive trees.
Oil represents light.
May God separate between these two
as only light can dispel darkness.
"Nor the destruction
that ravages at noon.
...and the punishment
of the wicked illuminator."
-Em...
-Oh, thank god.
I say to you that He will
save you from the ensnaring trap!
He will instruct His angels in your
behalf to guard you in all your ways.
I say to you in the name of God,
leave this flesh!
He will save you from
the destruction and pestilence.
You are cast away
from the eyes of God!
Tzadok, hey!
I'm calling to say thank you.
Clyde! I was going to call.
I need to get your car back to you.
You keep it.
I am not going to be going anywhere.
-So what are you going to do with it?
-I'm not sure.
I'm going to speak with my father.
We'll find a safe place for it.
