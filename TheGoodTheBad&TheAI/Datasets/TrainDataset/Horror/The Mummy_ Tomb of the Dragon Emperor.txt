Leave me.
Prepare for war!
Stop! I am not harmed.
We attack tonight!
I have too much to do for one lifetime.
Your Majesty...
Rise up.
I do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...
...but I know where to find it.
General...
No man is to touch her.
She is mine.
This is a key.
You have served me well.
I will grant you anything you desire.
I want to spend my life with General Ming.
Of course.
Read.
I feel your spell working.
I am now immortal.
Come, I want to show you something.
Become my queen and I will let him live.
Do what he says! Save yourself!
You will never keep your word.
You are right.
Now, join General Ming in hell.
What did you do to me?
I cursed you and your army.
Surround the Palace!
The Emperor is in trouble!
You can run, but you can't hide.
One o'clock.
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...
And this is something for grown men to do?
Come on.
Bite on this.
Evy, I'm home!
Mrs O'Connell is at her book reading, sir.
She'll be home for dinner.
Oh, right. Well, that's great,
'cause we're having fish.
You didn't think I'd catch anything,
did you?
I had the utmost confidence, sir.
JAMESON: There's a hook in your neck, sir.
Shall I fetch the wire cutters?
LONDON
"'Oh, God, Scarlet, I thought I'd lost you.'
'For a moment there, you did.'
"Bathed in rays of golden sunlight,
"our heroes sealed their reunion
with a kiss of timeless passion,
"their love deeper and truer than ever."
Mrs O'Connell, we're all dying to know,
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character
really based on you?
Honestly, I can say
she's a completely different person.
- Any more questions?
- WOMAN: Mrs O'Connell...
Mrs O'Connell, is your life today
as exciting as it was before the war?
I wish my life were that exciting now.
MAN: Will there be another book
in the series?
WOMAN 2: Do you believe in happy endings?
Isn't this blissful?
Dinner at home.
- Every night.
- Every night.
- Here's to retirement.
- May we stay this happy forever.
Still no letter from Alex.
I've sent him three in the last month.
Yeah, well, what do you expect?
The only time we ever hear from that kid
is when he's getting kicked out of college
or he needs more money.
I'm sure he's just buried in his studies.
- So, how did your book reading go?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.
Until they asked me, "When will there
be another Mummy adventure?"
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher
a third book.
I know.
But I spend my nights staring
at a blank page, completely blocked.
We could skip dinner, and I could
attempt to inspire you upstairs.
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.
But I'm going to sit at that typewriter
until something exciting comes out.
Thank you.
Trout. How lovely!
I'm so happy you found a hobby
that doesn't involve guns.
NINGXIA PROVINCE, CHINA
Don't worry, we'll find the entrance today.
Li Tung, what's for lunch?
Noodle soup.
Very good.
ALEX: Good. Wilson's back.
You're a couple days late, Professor.
I was beginning to think
you'd run into bandits.
Oh, my dear fellow,
thank you for the concern.
- Are you thirsty?
- Oh, yes, please.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You know,
when I saw you standing up there,
I thought I was looking at your father.
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.
Yeah, well, hopefully after today,
he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.
What a powerful face!
When I told my colleagues at the museum
that you had discovered the Colossus,
they were thrilled.
- Yes, however...
- I know.
When am I gonna get in that tomb?
Don't let the buggers get you down.
It was you that discovered
the Bembridge journal,
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.
- I have complete faith in you, Alex.
- Thank you, Professor.
Thanks for believing in me.
We found it! We found the door!
Yeah.
No.
Prepare to die!
Take that!
Rick!
Darling, where are you?
I'm ready to be inspired.
Do you remember the time
the mummy had me tied down?
And you came to save me and you cut...
No! You tore open the ropes
is what you did,
just as he was about to plunge his...
Oh, rats.
Watch out!
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests.
- Yeah.
Stay together.
Sir Colin Bembridge.
Oh, gee...
He went searching for this tomb
They left him like this as a warning.
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man
that's gonna make us famous.
Let's keep moving.
Look at it, Alex.
Look at it!
Chu Wah!
- Chu Wah.
- No, no, don't, don't, don't.
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.
This kind of danger goes with the territory.
You know that better than anyone.
Alex!
- Yes?
- Okay.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap.
Oh, Jesus.
All the warriors are facing in to this point,
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor.
- Well, then, where is he?
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave
robber's beaten us to the prize, do you?
No, he's still here.
You see, this is a feng shui compass.
Okay. Now. This...
Okay, this is true north,
but the feng shui compass
is set in the opposite direction.
- All right, we need to realign it.
- All right.
- All right, here we go.
- All right.
Alex! Alex, speak to me!
Are you all right?
- Alex!
- I'm fine.
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?
Alex!
What is it?
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!
"If he is awakened,
all mortals should despair."
It's definitely him!
Even had his concubines buried alive
with him.
Selfish bastard.
Hey, Professor Wilson,
you want to come down and take a look?
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?
Wilson!
Let's go, Professor.
We've got a lot of work to do.
WILSON: All right.
FRY: First of all, I'd just like to say
that the Foreign Office appreciates
all that you did during the war.
But I've been sent to offer you
one last assignment.
I'm afraid we've retired
from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?
Yeah, we've... We don't do that any more.
We're finished.
- EVELYN: Not at all.
- Completely done.
But just out of curiosity,
what is the mission anyway?
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.
- Nice piece of ice.
- It's the Eye of Shangri-La.
If you believe the legend,
it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.
Now, the government would like
to return it to the Shanghai Museum
as a sign of good faith
to the Chinese people.
And with your expertise in the field,
we naturally thought of you.
Oh, we'd be so flattered.
But Rick and I, we made a promise
to each other after the war
that we would settle down.
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We...
- I see.
Well, I must admit I am a little disappointed.
Postwar China is very dangerous.
There are a lot of factions that would love
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.
In lesser hands,
the Eye could be lost forever.
We couldn't let that happen, could we?
No, that could be bad for the world.
- The world... Terrible.
- Yeah.
You know, she has a brother
who lives in Shanghai.
- Jonathan!
- Yes.
He owns a nightclub, if I'm not mistaken.
We have been meaning to visit. We could...
- We should...
...drop in and surprise him.
- Say hello.
- Why not?
Does this mean
we can count on you one last time?
Yes.
SHANGHAI, CHINA
CHINESE NEW YEAR, 1947
There we are.
Here's to you, Princess.
And Imhotep.
May the bugger actually stay dead.
Ding-dong.
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.
Smooth special for the pup, huh?
The explorer.
Make that two.
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but I got a better offer.
JONATHAN: No, no, Alex. No, look.
Listen, how can I... Come here.
To put it in archaeological terms,
that's a tomb
in which many pharaohs have lain.
Now, listen, listen,
just think about me for a moment, all right?
Your discovery will go public in a few days,
and your parents are sure to find out.
They're not gonna be happy
you've dropped out of school. And...
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I'm here.
They're a long way away.
- Alex...
- Excuse me, okay?
I have some excavation to do.
Jonathan!
You're in China! Evy. Rick.
What are you... It's so...
I didn't even...
Brother, how lovely to see you.
I had no idea he was here!
- Who was here?
- Who?
MAN: This happens every time!
Every man in the bar!
- Dad?
- Alex!
MAN: I don't know what to do with you!
WOMAN: He's just a boy!
- I can't leave the room for 10 minutes!
- I didn't... Go away! Go to hell!
- MAN: I'm sick of it!
- Let's go get lover-boy!
I'm gonna kill you, kid!
Not so fast, that's my kid.
- Mad Dog Maguire?
- Ricochet O'Connell.
- Hey, hey.
- EVELYN: What are you doing here?
- Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?
- Just a little family get-together, folks.
Come on,
let's get back to having a good time. Music!
How long has it been?
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.
This guy could land a plane
on anything, you...
- Why are you here?
- Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.
Now, son or no son,
I gotta give him a beating!
- Get out of the way, Dad.
- Sit down.
Now as much as I'd really like you
to teach him a valuable lesson...
His mother would be upset! Very upset.
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.
I got a wife now, and a kid.
Things are a little bit different,
I'm sure you understand.
- Yeah.
- Let me make it up to you.
We're just surprised to see you here.
That's all.
JONATHAN: Who's gonna pay
for all this damage?
All right?
I'm not here five minutes,
and I'm already pulling your fanny
out of the fire.
You're going back to college.
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?
You two show up, tell me what to do?
No. But we should sit down
and discuss this like a family.
No offence, Mom,
but we haven't been a family in a long time.
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!
Alex, just... Alex, come here.
Can you...
Don't look at me like that.
- It's all your fault!
- My fault?
You're the one
that's always smothering him.
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.
His life was my top priority.
How many times did I save that kid
from breaking his neck?
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.
I'm his father. It's implied.
We've spent our entire lives
searching for priceless artefacts,
and the one thing
that's most precious to us,
we've lost.
We can't let Alex become some stranger
in pictures on our mantle.
- We can't let that happen.
- No, we can't.
How are we gonna fix this?
We need to do it together.
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST
WESTERN CHINA
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?
Our spy says they do.
Good.
Assemble the troops!
Yes sir.
Soldiers!
Soon all our training and sacrifice...
will bear great fruit.
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.
Soldiers...
tonight our great battle begins!
You know, this might have been faster
if we took a rickshaw.
It's Chinese New Year.
Don't you just love this country?
They have so many extra little holidays,
and drinking is mandatory.
I can't believe
we get to see your first big discovery.
It's so exciting.
Well, after last night,
I'm surprised you want to see it at all.
JONATHAN: Listen,
I'll pick you up in about an hour.
EVELYN: You're not coming?
JONATHAN: No, no,
I've seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.
There he is.
Oh, my darling, very impressive.
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?
ALEX: Well,
after the official red tape has been cut.
Do the words "rest in peace"
mean anything to you two?
So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,
and we can open it together?
I would like that very much, thanks.
Alex, why don't you go
and tell Professor Wilson
that we're here. You know...
No problem. Great.
Just don't wake the big guy up
while I'm gone.
Hey, Alex.
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.
Whatever you say, Dad.
What?
You just have a certain glow about you
this evening I haven't seen in a long time.
I guess mummies bring out the best in me.
Take a wrong turn at Cairo?
Sorry to interrupt.
- Roger.
- Professor Roger Wilson.
Rick.
You know, when Alex told me
that you had gone legit,
I just couldn't believe my ears.
Well, now I just pillage tombs
in the name of preservation. Evelyn.
- Congratulations on your latest discovery.
- Alex deserves all the credit.
He's one hell of a kid.
He's like the son I never had.
And he's the only one we've got,
so the next time you send him
on one of your field trips,
you give us the heads-up first.
Yes, yes, of course.
And now, I believe you have
something that belongs to us.
What's that?
Oh, you mean this?
I'm sorry...
There, go ahead.
All yours, Rog.
I knew I could rely on you two.
I'm afraid your work is not done yet,
Mr and Mrs O'Connell.
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine.
General Yang.
Roger!
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig.
We're in this together.
Cheek by jowl. General.
Search him.
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people.
You can't do this.
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,
make sure that it was you two
who delivered the Eye. Turn around.
The Eye contains the elixir
from the Pool of Eternal Life.
I need you to open it, Mrs O'Connell.
No.
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor,
aren't you?
And his Terracotta Army.
At least, that's the general idea.
Raising an army of mummies is insane.
Listen, Yang...
Easy! Go easy.
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!
Read the inscription! Now!
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!
I'll do it!
No, Evy, don't do it!
They're just gonna kill me, anyway.
The inscription says
that only a drop of blood
from a person of pure heart
can open the Eye.
Your husband was right.
No!
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice
themselves for the one they love.
Open it.
You never called after our last date.
I don't have time for games, Alex.
You know my name, but I don't know yours.
It's Lin.
You want to explain to me
why you tried to kill me?
We could do that.
Or we could save your parents.
Wilson, you son of a bitch!
- Get on with it, O'Connell.
- All right.
Once this touches him,
the Emperor will rise to rule again.
Finish him off.
Alex, please! Don't. That's...
Don't, don't. Don't, please.
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.
It's not him. This is a eunuch! It's a decoy!
Where the hell's the Emperor?
Stay!
Here we go again.
I live to serve you, my Lord.
I can help you become immortal.
If you are lying, you will burn.
Wait! Wait! You wait for me!
I'm coming with you! Wait, wait...
Watch out!
RICK: We got to put this mummy down fast!
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!
Open the gate! Open the gate!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry, pal.
There's a mummy on the loose.
- You wanna drive?
- Why not?
God, I love a woman who can drive a truck.
Hey, pal, I'm really sorry,
but you know what? Happy New Year!
Hit it, honey!
No! Move over!
What? No!
No!
No!
- What?
- Jonathan, get in the back!
Sorry about the Rolls!
You guys are like mummy magnets!
- We have to turn you around!
- Okay.
Excuse me.
- Hey, we could use this!
- Give me that!
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea.
- RICK: Size counts!
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!
Just drive!
RICK: Aim for the Emperor!
JONATHAN: Aim for the Emperor?
- Light it up, Jonathan!
- I'm trying!
Fire!
Did we get him?
- Fire!
- What, again?
- Your ass is on fire!
- My ass?
- Hold still!
- Rick, my ass is on fire!
- Well, spank my...
- I'm putting it out!
- Put me out, Rick!
- Just hold still!
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!
All right, here I come!
LIN: Give me your hand!
Come on!
Watch out!
RICK: Evy, where are you going?
- Taking a short cut!
- Evy!
- I told you it was a short cut!
- Right!
Now he's chasing us!
Hurry!
Give me your hand.
Here, you're gonna need these.
- Don't wait up for me.
- Where are you going?
Out!
- Where's Rick?
- Where do you think?
Damn it!
You're mine!
- Give me your hand and get on this horse!
- Get back, Dad!
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get
on the back of this horse this instant!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Oh, God!
JONATHAN: Evy!
We've got to go back and help Rick!
JONATHAN: Rick! Forget Rick!
Here they come!
I'll go after the Emperor.
Trust me. I've got a little more experience
with mummies.
And I have the only weapon
that can kill him.
Okay. I'll cover you. Let's go!
ALEX: Lin!
- I thought you were dead!
- He missed.
LIN: Look out!
- Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?
- Does it look like I have a wallet?
You know, I would have killed the Emperor
if you two hadn't blown my cover.
I had everything under control.
Oh, yeah, that's exactly
what we were thinking.
Yeah, well, good going,
you raised another mummy.
And this bugger's got superpowers.
ALEX: He's got control over fire, water,
metal and who knows what else.
And you dug him up anyway.
Yeah, well, you're not gonna
pin this one on me, okay, Dad?
- RICK: Am I?
- Oh, stop it, you two.
No one's to blame here.
Wilson manipulated all of us.
Yeah, that's true.
I apologise for my parents.
But I thought we worked
really well together.
Except we failed.
I'm sorry,
we haven't been properly introduced.
- Who are you exactly?
- My name is Lin.
My family has watched
over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.
The Emperor cannot be killed unless
he is stabbed through the heart with this.
My mother put a curse on it long ago.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.
- Sit.
- Down.
What do you really know about this girl?
Well, not much, but after her help tonight,
I'm willing to go on a little faith.
- Faith.
- Time is running out.
You don't really believe in the concept
of personal space, do you?
If the Emperor reaches Shangri-La
and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,
he will raise his army
and no one will be safe.
Much as I'd like to stay
this boyishly handsome forever,
Shangri-La is a crock.
Yeah, but that's what you used to say
about mummies, too, Jon.
- You did pretty well off it.
- Good point.
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.
Beyond it is a golden tower.
Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.
Yang still has the diamond,
and that's where
he and the Emperor will go.
She's right.
All the legends of the Eye
mention the Gateway.
I like her, Alex. She knows what's what.
Now, just say that we were to believe you,
could you guide us there?
Yes. I have been there once.
I remember the way.
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.
Well, I know just the Mad Dog for the job.
MAGUIRE: Well, any self-respecting pilot
would land on the valley floor,
but I don't have any self-respect,
so I'll put you down
halfway up the mountain.
That should give us a good advantage.
MAGUIRE: Of course,
I can't guarantee any of us will live.
Great!
I'd tell you to fasten your seatbelts,
but I was too cheap to buy any!
- Why am I laughing?
- Here we go!
RICK: Mad Dog, Mad Dog!
Ease up, ease up, ease up!
JONATHAN: Oh, God!
JONATHAN: Maguire!
Come on, man!
Mad Dog!
RICK: Brake! No, no! Nobody move.
Nobody move, nobody move!
What is that God-awful smell?
The yak yakked.
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.
Why did you raise me?
I love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.
What is in it for you?
I want to serve as your general.
The last general I trusted...
betrayed me.
I will not make that mistake.
I cannot escape this curse
until I am immortal...
General.
I understand, my Lord.
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.
This will point the way.
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet.
Go ahead, Mad Dog.
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow
you told me to keep me eye out for?
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.
That's us, people! Let's go!
- Jonathan, wake up!
- What...
Hold the line!
Good, we're a little more than halfway.
We're gonna...
We're gonna camp up there for the night.
ALEX: Lin says if we leave at first light,
we'll reach the Gateway by noon.
Did she happen to mention how she knows
so much about the Gateway?
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.
She's certainly managed to enchant you.
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.
Mom, the thin mountain air,
clearly messing with your head.
Whatever secret she's hiding,
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
I appreciate that, but, you know,
I've had my fair share of experience
with the opposite sex.
Really?
How many experiences
are we talking about?
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to, okay, Mom?
Right.
Hey, Mom.
I'm sorry I blamed you guys
for raising the Emperor.
What's so funny?
My mother is under the impression
there's something between us.
I hope nothing romantic.
Yeah, well, I told her there
was no chance of that.
We're complete opposites,
you and me, right?
You guard tombs. I raid them.
You like ancient knives. I'm into guns.
Those are some
pretty insurmountable odds.
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.
Now that we've cleared that up,
we can focus on taking down the Emperor.
I agree totally.
Besides, you're not my type.
Of course not. You don't like a woman
who can knock you on your backside.
The expression is "kick my ass."
And for the record, you didn't.
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.
Then again, I don't suppose
it's easy being you,
is it, Geraldine, old girl?
If I'd met a girl like you, Geraldine...
You know, hard-working,
you don't say much,
you're a little bit hairy, but I don't mind that.
There it is! We found it!
The Gateway of Shangri-La!
JONATHAN: Go, girl! Go! You're free!
Go, Geraldine! Live free!
What did you do now? Rob an armoury?
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?
Looks pretty anaemic
compared to the Peacekeeper.
Well, it's not about size, Dad.
It's about stamina.
You want power?
I give you the Thompson submachine gun.
Fifty rounds a drum.
- Twenty-five a mag.
- Tommy's good, Dad,
but the cocking mechanism always jams.
Here. Check out the Russian PPS
Personal Assault Weapon.
Now, this is the future right here.
You know, it's experience that wins the day.
It's not all about firepower.
Boys! If I may...
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?
Yeah. We're gonna hit him
high, hard and fast
and smash him like a Ming vase.
- And if that doesn't work?
- We go to plan B.
Plan B! You go upstairs,
you blow up that gold tower thing.
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high!
- Me?
- You! What?
- Dad?
So if the explosion doesn't kill us,
the avalanche will.
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. I do.
I say we ambush him
with long-range rifles and silencers.
Long-range, that's a better idea.
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.
- JONATHAN: Much better idea.
- And then we can finish him off
- with Lin's dagger.
- Look, I'm sorry,
I just don't put much faith
in your girlfriend's magic dagger.
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend.
- You say that now,
- but I still don't trust her.
- Well, I do.
- So you should trust my judgement, okay?
- Look, kid,
I've put down more mummies
in my time than you.
You put down one mummy, Dad.
Yeah. Same mummy twice!
EVELYN: Hand me the green wire,
will you, please?
Are you sure you know what you are doing?
Of course. I've done this a hundred times.
If the Emperor places the Eye up there,
all will be lost.
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.
Prove yourself to me.
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!
Fire!
Bazooka!
RICK: Fall back!
Alex! Follow me!
We gotta take out those bazookas!
Go!
Fall back!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!
Hey, I'm actually a little bit concerned
about plan B!
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?
Just make it go bang! I'll cover you!
Come on.
All right, let's go, go, go!
Come on, come on!
Come on. Oh, be good.
Set up a crossfire!
Move it!
