Look at you. Come here.
I told you, you've got to
double-knot those things.
One of these days...
we'll have to get you
some zipper shoes.
Father...
why are we doing this?
I know, Maya.
But you'll understand
when you see this man.
Ensemble pour toujours,
quoi qu'il arrive.
He's in torment...
the way you were when I met you.
I've got patients.
I've got sprinklers.
I've got a flood.
I'm ready to build an ark.
Hook me up with maintenance.
You're killing me!
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not
comfortable with this.
The patient
is legally entitled to it.
The patient has been plagued
by temporal lobe seizures.
It is the patient's request,
Doctor.
I am aware of that,
but I don't think...
he's in any condition
to make requests.
I'm trying to appeal
to your logical self, Father.
I'm concerned
about harm to my patient.
Father Jeremy...
Deacon John Townsend
of St. Ursula's...
and our associate, Maya Larkin.
Associate?
Secular assistants
can be permitted...
if they are regarded
as qualified.
I'm going in with you.
You wouldn't last five minutes.
Just open the door.
What do you think
of the color of this room?
It's supposed to be relaxing.
Hello, Henry.
You know why we're here.
I'm really
looking forward to it.
Let us prepare the room.
Get the other one.
Please, do the other one.
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.
God, the Holy Trinity, one God,
have mercy on us.
Holy Mary, pray for us.
-Holy Mother of God.
-Pray for us.
-Holy Virgin of Virgins.
-Pray for us.
Saint Michael. Saint Gabriel.
Saint Raphael.
Holy angels and archangels.
All holy orders
of blessed spirits.
Saint John the Baptist.
Saint Joseph.
All holy patriarchs
and prophets.
Saint Peter. Saint Paul...
...our sins
or those of our forefathers.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Do not punish us
for our offenses.
Lead us not into temptation.
Hail Mary.
Do not punish us
for our offenses.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
-They're all still in there.
-What the hell is that?
-It's in Birdson's room.
-Jesus!
Get Haldol, Cogentin, Ativan,
five, two, and two IM.
Open the door!
Father!
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou
amongst women...
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou
amongst women...
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...
Mr. Silberman...
you worked for your whole life
at the same company.
-Is that correct?
-That's correct.
And you worked with
the defendant George Viznik...
for the last two years
in the same room?
Right.
How would you describe him?
Quiet. Real quiet.
And on the day of the murders,
his state of mind?
He seemed on edge. A little.
On the day of the murders,
what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.
He said he was bothered...
by all the people
who kept telling him what to do.
He said he was bothered...
by all the people
who kept telling him what to do?
Is that what you said?
Tell the jury how many people
work in that office...
with you and Mr. Viznik.
How many people?
Well, just me.
Could those voices
have come from outside?
Next room?
-Hey, Mr. Kelson.
-Hi, Robert.
Thanks.
Here's the stuff you wanted
on pathological narcissism.
What about that psychic?
What's his name? Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
I still think
it's a waste of time.
The police used him
as a witness in the case.
I'll be at my brother's tonight
if you need me.
"D" equals two.
"E" equals three.
So four should be five.
"H" is six. One equals seven.
"J" equals eight.
"K"...nine.
"N"...twelve.
So "E" equals...
"K"..."P" is twenty-four.
Thirteen..."E."
Two..."T."
Thirteen..."E."
Twenty-six..."R."
"Kelson."
We welcome Peter Kelson...
author of the current
bestseller "Vicious lntent"...
as part of today's story
on the trial...
of mass murderer George Viznik.
Thank you so much
for joining us, Peter.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Peter, you're making a career of
studying sensational murderers.
How does it feel,
day after day...
face to face with killers?
Long-term exposure
to these things...
tends to give you a sort of
clinical understanding...
of the subject.
It sounds as if you're saying
the closer you get to evil...
the less evil it becomes.
No, the less mystifying.
Good and evil
are only illusions.
I don't believe in evil
with a capital "E."
That suggests
some kind of external force...
some third-party bad guy
pulling all the strings.
Are you referring
to the defense's efforts...
to prove that George Viznik
is tormented by demonic voices?
There were no voices.
Not even from mental illness
as the defense asserts?
Are you trying
to get me to say...
there's another cause
for little voices?
No. Viznik's a manipulator.
He has what I call
malignant narcissism.
Hey, beautiful.
Uncle James.
-How you doing?
-Fine, thank you.
That's great.
And you? Lovely as always.
You ready?
Yeah. These guys
have been doing this...
twice a week for ten years...
and they still
can't get it right.
All right,
you shrieking harpies!
Enough of that racket!
Be off with you!
Claire!
You guys are a little late.
Hey, little brother.
-Hey, Will.
-It's about time, man!
I'm starving!
It's good to see you guys
out of the house.
You got to come out here
more often.
Here, Claire, after you.
Bless us, O Lord,
for these Thy gifts.
Through Thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord.
And a special blessing...
for Peter and William's
mother Andrea...
and their father Jack...
in whose memory
we gather here every year.
May their souls and the souls
of the faithfully departed...
rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
Well, dig in.
I made a reservation at Marco's
for Peter's birthday dinner...
but I'm thinking
I should have you cater it.
Thank you.
-What time did you make it for?
-8:00. Is that good?
Remember that dream I used
to have when I was little...
about the bear on the mountain?
You know, right after--
I don't know. Maybe the trial's
been getting to me...
because I've been having
this weird dream every night.
Really?
You didn't say anything to me.
It's probably trivial.
If it's recurring,
maybe it's not so trivial.
OK, I'll tell you.
I'm reading this book...
and I can't remember what
the book is when I wake up...
but I realize
halfway through it...
it's something
that I've written...
or will write, actually.
And, anyway,
I get to the end of the book...
and I'm feeling very satisfied.
And I close the cover
to read the title...
and the title,
it just says "X-E-S."
Just three letters.
For some reason,
that makes me feel great.
Then I wake up.
It usually makes me
feel great, too.
But I fall asleep
right afterwards.
What do you mean?
"X-E-S"
is "sex" spelled backwards.
What can I say?
I'm not a master of the obvious.
Not even from mental illness
as the defense asserts?
Are you trying
to get me to say...
there's another cause
for little voices, Sally?
No, Viznik's a manipulator.
He's clever.
He has what I call
malignant narcissism.
He's dangerously self-obsessed,
but not psychotic.
He's incapable.
He has no capacity
to understand...
or ability to recognize
any higher authority.
What about Peter Kelson?
Where is your moral compass?
I like to think
I'm the actual needle...
on the compass.
Morality is which way
you're facing...
depending on the dilemma...
but the needle,
it always points north.
"Best-selling author...
"New York native...
"Own parents murdered
in an unsolved crime."
John, I know who he is.
What's going on?
Birdson's repeating numbers.
It's a code I found
in the papers...
that I took from his room.
It spells "Peter Kelson."
So he's the one.
We have to check the criteria.
Baptismal records, blood type.
I found his doctor,
so that's a start.
And then what?
If Father Lareaux's
not up to this...
I filed a report
with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
The Church dismisses this
completely. You know that.
We need all the help we can get
right now, John. We really do.
-Here?
-There.
Thanks, Mike.
Sure thing, Peter.
Hey, James.
Seems Viznik isn't making
too many friends in lockup.
He got beat up.
I'll get my smokes.
I'll be back.
All right.
What's the matter with you?
He was looking right at me.
He could see me.
Viznik.
Your time's up.
I don't know.
Maybe he was looking
right at himself, right?
Maya, the diocese
has rejected your report.
And I have to tell you...
I agree with them.
I believe
that these are projections...
caused by
your unfortunate childhood.
Maya, Satan is not
what you think he is.
If you really
believed in God, Father...
why is it
so inconceivable to you...
that His adversary
could be just as real?
The Church...
will not tolerate
your obsessions.
If you want to stay here,
leave this alone.
Idiots.
Is anybody in there?
You're not real.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
Yes. I'm from St. Ursula's.
I was told you could help me
with some baptismal records...
for one of our new parishioners.
The person's name?
Peter Kelson.
Here you are.
Great. Thank you.
Hey! What are you doing home?
I forgot my car keys.
What are you doing
on this floor?
We got Mr. Kowalski's mail
again.
Lucky Mr. Kowalski.
Hey, come here.
Just an outside observer.
...what I've heard...
it seems that Mr. Viznik
is probably not schizophrenic.
Can I help you?
Peter Kelson?
I saw you
on television yesterday...
and I thought
you were brilliant.
Thank you.
You work in the building
or coming from the party?
You said something
really interesting.
You said malignant narcissism
was not evil.
Yes, I did.
Not pure evil.
That's correct.
And also that--
I'm sorry,
but I'm running late.
And that there was no such thing
as evil with a capital "E."
It's not the most
popular opinion, but yes.
What if I told you
I was a malignant narcissist?
Have a seat.
I probably wouldn't believe you.
A narcissist wouldn't admit it.
It's basically an extreme form
of self-denial.
-Do you mind?
-Please, be my guest.
You want a drink?
No, thank you.
What if I told you that
I believe in God and the Devil?
In fact, I know that they exist.
Sorry.
I know.
Is that your girlfriend?
Excuse me?
Are you familiar with the case
or Henry Birdson...
the math professor who went home
and murdered his entire family?
Yeah.
What's that got to do with you?
Last week,
the Catholic Church...
certified him
as genuinely possessed.
You realize how rarely
they make that ruling?
Yes, I do.
An exorcism
was held for Mr. Birdson...
and it failed disastrously.
Is that right?
Thank you.
I really think
you should meet him.
With your book on Viznik...
I think you'd find him
very, very interesting.
I'm sure I would.
You seemed so self-assured
on television.
I thought that someone
with your confidence...
would be up for letting someone
try to prove you wrong.
Please, prove me wrong.
The world would be
so much simpler...
if it were all
just about good and evil.
Unfortunately,
I find it a much more--
I actually think
it is that simple.
This is a tape
of the Birdson exorcism.
I'll be in front of
the public library...
at 2:00 tomorrow.
If you're at all interested
in meeting him...
I can take you to where he is.
Hey, Joe.
How's it going?
-Some dirt.
-Thanks.
What a racket.
How do you live
with that all day?
What else can I do?
Mrs. Levotsky. Jesus.
Keep your hands off me.
What are you looking at?
Why don't you go inside
and make more noise?
Go play your music.
Play it so loud that nobody
could sleep. Go ahead.
Noisemaker.
Inconsiderate. Selfish.
-Holy Virgin of virgins.
-Pray for us.
-Saint Michael.
-Pray for us.
-Saint Gabriel. Saint Raphael.
-Pray for us.
Holy angels and archangels...
Stop it!
Come on!
Come on, I turned it off!
Where are you?
I'm sorry.
It's just this strange woman
waltzes into my office today...
says she can get me in
to see this killer.
You're not getting involved
in this, are you?
No, of course not.
So, I got you a latte.
Thank you.
Didn't know what you wanted.
I'm glad you came.
Take the Williamsburg Bridge.
What did you think of the tape?
I think you gave me
the wrong one.
What do you mean?
It was blank.
There was nothing on it.
You gave me the wrong one.
Are you sure?
I cranked it all the way up.
Nothing but hum.
So, what'd I miss?
Shouldn't we wait
for the doctor?
I'm sure she won't mind.
It's right here.
It's not locked?
Not necessary anymore.
-Mr. Kelson.
-Hello, Doctor.
What a pleasure to meet you.
I have to say,
your instincts are impeccable.
I am a fan.
Thanks, Doctor. Coming from you,
that's quite a compliment.
When your secretary phoned...
she didn't mention
her coming along, too.
My secretary?
You are aware
that this woman was party...
to the so-called exorcism?
No, I didn't, actually.
I've never felt that Mr. Birdson
needed anything...
but professional
psychiatric care.
Minutes after these people left,
he suffered a stroke.
He's completely comatose.
There's no brain-wave activity
at all.
What do you believe
put him in this condition?
They put him under
severe mental stress.
That caused the aneurysm.
Could you tell us what you heard
when you tried to open the door?
I certainly hope you're not
lending any credence to this.
Just tell him what you heard.
Well, the patient
was in severe distress...
so naturally he was yelling.
And when you opened the door,
was he yelling...
or was he sitting here calmly?
There's a medical explanation
for everything that happened.
You heard the voices.
You know you did.
Sounded like a hundred voices
to me.
I've already said
that Mr. Birdson was agitated.
Victor, would you check on
the patient in room 5, please?
Could you just describe it
to me, the scene?
He opened his eyes.
He just opened his eyes.
I'm surprised at you,
Mr. Kelson.
Allen, he just opened his eyes.
-Please leave.
-Excuse us, Doctor.
I'm not making this up.
I swear!
-Let's go now.
-I did not hallucinate that!
He just opened his eyes!
Where do you get off
pretending to be my secretary?
I had to.
Did you? And this is evil?
The guy had an aneurysm.
Now he's in a coma.
That's their explanation.
I know you don't believe me.
Yeah, well, why should l?
Maya, wait a minute. Wait.
Detective Smythe, please.
Hey, Mike, it's Peter.
I'm good, thanks.
Could you pull some prints
off something for me?
Great.
Father.
It's Maya.
Can you hear me?
Leave him alone.
Once upon a time...
He's not going to respond.
The doctor's afraid
that he might not even recover.
He will. He has great strength.
-What was he saying in there?
-I don't know.
Besides, it's useless.
I mean, look at him.
What are you doing?
You can't back out on me now.
We need to be sure.
He couldn't hear the tape.
What other proof do you need,
Maya?
I'm not going to sit around
until it's too late.
Oh. And what is that, John?
What is that?
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Please give me the strength.
Live through me.
Give us this day
our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses...
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
I'm in the dressing room.
...but deliver us from evil...
I picked your tuxedo up
from the cleaners.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou
amongst women...
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God...
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.
It is the biggest
publishing party of the year.
You'd better hurry up.
Don't fail me.
Give me the grace, strength,
the courage to do your work.
Show me the way.
I saw you on the news.
I think you're even better live.
He is.
By the way, Lauren, did you
finish your book on tattoo art?
I hear your publisher
wants his advance back.
That's not true.
So, Peter,
how crowded is the field now?
I mean, there are, what,
Six, actually.
But no one has the access
that I have.
Is it true
the cops used a psychic?
I saw a psychic once.
Those guys
are definitely for real.
I saw some cable show about...
Cookbooks.
No, thanks.
God will forgive me.
The time of transformation
is near.
What?
You OK?
Sweetheart.
Thanks for handling this.
Sure thing.
I think I got enough between
your preliminary statements...
and all the eyewitness accounts.
You can go home.
Give me till morning
to find out who this guy is...
and till then,
don't sweat it, huh?
Thanks again for everything,
Mike.
Don't thank me.
Somebody up there likes you.
Thanks, bro.
Good evening,
Mr. Kelson, Miss Claire.
I want to tell you something.
I'm so upset.
Your neighbor, Mrs. Levotsky,
she's dead.
-What?
-She's dead.
-That's horrible.
-What happened?
Apparently, sometime last night,
she killed herself.
The paramedics told me
that she hung herself.
Climbed up on her dresser.
A stocking around her neck.
But I don't know.
She was completely rheumatoid.
It's a shame.
Anyway,
I thought you should know.
It's funny.
All my life, I thought I was...
I was someone
who didn't believe in any of it.
It doesn't matter.
He believes in you.
But it's true.
I have no faith, James.
It's strange.
When that gun was pointed
in my face tonight...
I was surprised,
but I was never frightened.
Not for one second.
It was as if I knew nothing
could possibly happen to me.
In that one moment...
I didn't care about anything.
Not even my own life.
Peter, you must care
about your own life.
I respect that you
have such faith, James.
I don't understand it, but...
I want you to know
that I admire you.
I admire you, and I always will.
I appreciate you saying that.
I think I'd better go.
Thanks for coming.
Good morning, Father.
Father, what's wrong?
It's about John.
Last night,
he tried to shoot Kelson.
What?
Maya, John's dead.
Coffee for you, miss?
Thank you.
I can't do this.
-Excuse me.
-Oh, God.
You have to put
your napkin in your lap.
Gina!
How's this? Better?
I'm sorry.
She's really into rules.
That's fine.
Doesn't your daughter
put her napkin on her lap?
I don't have a daughter.
Aren't you lonely?
That's enough.
I have someone
who takes care of me.
But he's dead.
Jesus is dead.
Jesus is dead.
You are so weak.
-How you doing?
-I'm good.
-How you doing?
-Good.
So, what have you found?
Well, we traced this guy
to a seminary in Newark.
Now, if you can believe this,
he was a deacon.
Really?
I talked to the man in charge,
a Father Frank Page...
and he said that the gunman,
John Townsend...
had been caught up in some kind
of nonsense about the Devil...
along with a priest
named Lareaux...
and a woman named Maya Larkin.
Same woman whose prints we took
off that coffee cup you gave us.
So, what's going on here?
-Can we go for a walk?
-Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.
She came to my office
the other day...
and tells me this weird story
about demonic possession.
She's got a juvenile record
from New Orleans.
Her parents died
when she was thirteen.
Her parents died?
Yeah. Murder-suicide.
Anyway, she was a runaway.
Arrested for vandalism...
petty theft, drugs,
the whole bit.
Parole records show
that she graduated...
from community college,
moved into a retreat house...
and teaches some classes
at the seminary school.
Hasn't been
in any trouble since.
Le pain.
Le chien.
Le chapeau.
I need to go to the bathroom.
OK, Daniel.
-La fleur.
-I need to go to the bathroom.
OK, go ahead, Daniel.
La glace.
Le poulet.
Very good.
Le chat.
Le chapeau.
Good.
We need to talk.
-Peter, I'm in the middle of a--
-Now.
Children,
just stay in your seats.
I'll be...
A guy named John Townsend
tried to shoot me.
Now I find out you knew him.
What the fuck is going on?
Why did he try to kill me? Why?
Townsend believed that just
as God became man in Christ...
Satan will assume human form.
Oh, my God.
I believe it, too.
And the point is?
At the exorcism,
Birdson boasted...
that Satan was about
to take over the body of a man.
You are that man, Peter.
What?
It's true. He knew your name.
He was writing it
in this numerical code.
I figured it out.
It spelled your name.
You should really think hard
about getting professional help.
You're already--
Get your hands off me.
You're already contaminated,
Peter.
That's why
you couldn't hear the tape.
There's probably a pentacle
near your bed to sanctify you.
-I'm won't be drawn into this.
-Look for it.
I know it sounds crazy.
You need proof.
Check your parents' blood types.
No, don't.
My parents are dead!
Are you sure your parents
are your birth parents?
My parents are dead.
You're becoming the Antichrist
who is born unholy...
and becomes the door to eternal
suffering in this world.
If you or any
of your lunatic friends...
ever come near me again...
You have no messages
at this time.
Melvin Szabo,
this is Peter Kelson.
Peter, this is the psychic.
I'd appreciate it
if you'd put that back.
You're the younger one of two.
You're afraid of committing
to this girl...
but she worships you.
Your mother is dead,
but your father is alive.
Nothing you couldn't find out
from reading the papers...
and you're already wrong
on one count.
Viznik will get off, and Robert
has got a crush on you.
How dare you?
You know what?
You can go.
Suit yourself.
I will.
But does this mean
anything to you?
You do know, don't you,
that these are also numbers?
Greek numbers--
six hundred, sixty, and six.
Or the sign of the Devil.
Get out of here.
Wait a minute.
"God will forgive me."
"The time of transformation
is near."
Get the fuck out of here.
-Look, I'm--
-Just get out.
Help me.
Show--
I don't understand
what's going on.
This has been planned
since your birth.
You fit all the criteria
that we know of.
Never baptized, devoid of faith,
born of incest.
I was baptized.
I was certainly
not born of incest.
You were never baptized.
At least, I don't believe
it was Christian.
Your baptism was performed
by your uncle...
James MacKenzie, right?
Yes, I know.
The only baptism
he ever performed...
in seven years
as pastor at Bedford.
Yeah, so what?
Seven years. One baptism?
Your mother's only brother?
Do you know
your parents' blood types?
My father was O-positive...
and my mother, A-negative.
You're an AB-negative.
There is no way...
that your birth father
could be an O-positive.
It's impossible.
This is ridiculous.
There's been a mistake.
I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
When Townsend tried to kill me,
he said something.
"The time of transformation
is near."
What does that mean?
He must've figured something out
on his own.
Maybe we should go to his house.
It's hot in here.
What are we looking for exactly?
I don't know.
Papers, anything.
He's bought all my books.
What's this?
Spells.
What was that?
It's just a bulb.
It blew. It's OK.
There's nothing here.
I'll check upstairs, OK?
All right.
There's nothing upstairs
except empty rooms.
You got anything here?
It's not what we're looking for.
I'll keep looking.
No. Not again.
You're not real.
Watch out. It's sharp.
Henry, I know you don't
want to do this.
Henry, I know you don't
want to do this.
I know you don't.
Put it down.
Put it down.
Shit.
Peter, he can't hurt you.
You OK?
Keep it up.
Your thirty-third birthday.
That's the transformation
Townsend was talking about.
He found it
in one of Lareaux's books.
What are you doing?
It's going to happen...
at the exact moment
of your birth.
My birthday's tomorrow.
What?
Oh, my God!
Know what the last thing
I said to my mother was?
"See you tomorrow."
And she said, "You know it."
And I can see her face...
smiling.
A real smile.
Why didn't you just
go along with Townsend?
Because until it happens,
you're still a person.
What about after?
You're gone.
But if you die...
then Satan can't stay.
Unless we stop
the transformation.
It should be in here.
Here it is.
Tomorrow afternoon, 4:55.
Maybe there's something
in one of Lareaux's books.
They're in the car.
I'll check. Just stay here.
What are you doing
on this floor?
We got Mr. Kowalski's mail
again.
Yeah? Lucky Mr. Kowalski.
Here he is.
He's right here.
Sweetheart, where have you been?
I've been so worried.
Is this the person
you were telling me about?
What are these?
I don't know. What are they?
I found them
behind your picture.
They're the spare set.
I thought the spare set
was in the kitchen drawer.
You were hiding them.
Darling, you're tired.
I found the pentacle.
The pentacle?
What are you talking about?
I found the pentacle, Claire.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
No. Give me the gun, Claire!
Maya, look.
Little one! Ah, yes.
Thank God you're better.
We really need your help.
We only have
a couple of more hours.
Don't worry.
Not about the transformation.
What do you mean,
don't worry about it?
In my prayers...
I came to realize that we've
been fooling ourselves.
Probably blown this out
of all proportion.
And that God...
would never allow
a thing like this to happen.
I told you.
This was a myth all along.
So we won.
That's right, Maya.
We won.
Christ triumphed over Satan.
That's right, Maya.
So if Christ won, that means--
What does that mean, Father?
Satan is the weak one.
He's the coward who trembles.
The whimpering slave of God.
Maya, that's enough.
Come here.
He will make Christ crawl...
through the shit!
He's our best chance
if we can get him back.
What can I do?
Just wait outside.
So are you going to do it?
I don't have the expertise.
Father Thomas should officiate.
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.
Help me overcome all fear
and selfishness.
Help me find
and keep my strength.
Help me fight the evil
I'm about to see...
with all the courage
you can give.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, please don't die.
Don't die.
Go...
and find his uncle.
Don't die.
"God appears,
and God is light...
"to those poor souls
who dwell in night.
"But does a human form...
"display to those
who dwell in realms of day?"
Welcome.
Did you really think
that you could just end this?
They had
their two thousand years.
Now it's our turn.
Everything you said...
Everything you did...
I did for you, Peter.
I love you.
Think of it.
I'm giving you a gift.
Absolute power.
Peter, absolute knowledge.
But you raised me
like your own son.
Why, yes.
You are my son, Peter.
You are my son.
Peter, don't you see
the opportunities...
that lie before you?
You killed my parents.
How could you?
I had to.
No! It's what they want.
Don't do it, Peter!
Do it! It will be
my ultimate sacrifice.
If you commit murder,
you accept evil.
Drop it.
You have no idea how much you
look like your mother right now.
Thank you, Maya.
You served us quite well.
Go ahead.
I'm not strong enough for this.
Listen to me.
I'll see you tomorrow.
It didn't happen. Maya.
It didn't happen.
I'm OK.
Put the gun down.
Maya, please, it's me.
It's me. It's me.
