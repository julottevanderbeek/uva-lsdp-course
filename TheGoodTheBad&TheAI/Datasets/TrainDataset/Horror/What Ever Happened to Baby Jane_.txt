Want to see it again, little girl?
It shouldn't frighten you.
I'm sorry. Nothing until
matinee tomorrow.
Lady,
would ya mind takin' off your hat?
Excuse me.
Atta girl, Janey. Show 'em how!
Oh, thank you, folks.
Thank you very much, thank you...
One final request, all right?
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy!"
All right, thank you.
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy."
"I've written a letter to Daddy.
"His address is heaven above.
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...
"...and wish you were with us to love.
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.
"The postman says that's best to do.
"I've written this letter to Daddy...
"...saying, I love you.
"I've written a letter to Daddy...
"...saying, I love you!"
Well, what do you have here?
All for you.
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?
Thank you, young man,
that's a gorgeous doll!
Folks, have you ever seen
such a lovely doll?
Don't forget, there's a genuine...
...Baby Jane doll waiting for each and
every one of you right out in the foyer.
All you have to do is go out there
and collect it. And kids, remember...
...you can tell your moms that
each and everyone of these...
...genuine, beautiful, great
big dolls...
...is an exact replica of your own
Baby Jane Hudson.
Baby Jane dolls.
Only $3.25.
I won't, I don't wanna
go back to that ol' hotel!
I don't have to take a nap
and you can't make me!
Now, Jane, don't act up, sweetheart.
You've got to take your nap.
You know that.
No, I don't know and I'm not going to!
You don't want all these
nice friends of yours out here...
...to think that you're
a bad little girl, do ya?
I don't care! I want an ice cream!
Janey, I told you...
I make the money,
so I can have what I want!
Leave me alone! I need an ice cream!
Well, if you need an ice cream...
...I guess you better have some.
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.
But remember, this is
the last time this week.
All right, Daddy.
Blanche wants some, too.
We gotta have some
ice cream for Blanche.
I don't want anything.
What do you think you're tryin' to do?!
I always said it's the parents' fault
in cases like this.
I'm really disappointed!
It sure is a hot day today.
You're the lucky one, though,
Blanche, really you are.
Someday it's going to be you
that's getting all the attention.
And when that happens, I...
...I want you to try to be kinder
to Jane and your father...
...than they are to you now.
You know what I mean?
I hope you'll try'n remember that.
I won't forget.
You bet I won't forget!
The Seltzer Agency sent you?
Think there's any chance for me?
There's a chance if Mr. Weber likes you.
What type does he like?
A lot of personality.
I'll catch on, watch me.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
With my money
I should make a picture like that, huh?
Good morning, Mr. Weber.
I'm Ms. Brent.
Yes. Won't you come a little closer,
please?
She's got a southern accent
like I got a southern accent.
I know it's 11:00!
I'll be there when I get there!
Gardner is here to see you.
Gardner?
I'll come out.
I'll be right back, Ms. Brent.
Have yourself a cigarette.
Make yourself at home.
Then the job is mine?
Need you ask?
Kill it!
What do you think, Ben?
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?
She stinks, doesn't she?
They say the end's pretty good.
Maybe we should've seen it through.
You gonna want that picture
again today, Mr. Feldman?
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want
that picture again!
When the old man hired them
Hudson sisters...
...how come he had to hire
the back end of the act, too?
Boy, what a no-talent broad
that Baby Jane is!
Why can't she stay sober?
Jane's got her pride.
She's a very sensitive girl.
Your "very sensitive girl" guzzled
her way through six cases of Scotch...
...and slugged two studio cops.
Not to mention one or two other
less savory items of publicity...
...before we got that so-called
epic in the can.
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.
If Blanche will only let us out
of that clause in the contract...
...which says that we have to make
a picture with Baby Jane...
...for every picture that we make
with Blanche.
Then Baby Jane's contract
won't be any problem.
You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.
Possibly.
But somehow,
I can't see Blanche doing that.
You know, I don't get it!
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing
in movies today.
She can write her own ticket.
She's got a script approval.
She's got more money than she knows
what to do with...
You know, she just bought that
tremendous place Valentino used to have.
It's gonna take her a year
to fix it up...
...the way she wants it
before they move in.
Well I guess they can manage
to struggle on where they are now.
But, my point is she ought to have
sense enough to know that...
...she can't make a star
out of Baby Jane again.
Blanche doesn't have
any illusions like that.
But she's a very fine person, Ben.
She's never gonna forget
those early years.
What her sister did for her.
She told me that herself.
Well, I tell you, she's not doin'
Baby Jane any favor.
Someday, sooner or later,
that girl's gonna end up in a home.
Look, you're going to their party
at the Grove tonight, aren't you?
Did you ever try refusing
one of Blanche's invitations?
Do me a favor, Marty, will ya?
You talk to Blanche.
Try to make her understand, huh?
- Do my best.
- Thanks...
Remind me to send you
one of those...
...Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.
I've got mine for this year.
I don't get it, Marty.
What do they make monsters
like this for?
For Blanche Hudson.
That's our problem.
You go to bed!
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, hi, dear.
Hello, beautiful!
How 'bout a little souvenir?
Let go of that, will ya, let go!
Come on, don't be like that.
Who do you think you are?
Thanks.
Isn't she great?
Sorry to break in on this fine old
Blanche Hudson movie, folks.
But you'll be glad I did...
...when you see what I have
right here...
...for that favorite pooch of yours.
And Iliad means quality.
So when your dog says, "woof woof"...
...feed him Iliad,
the classic dog food.
Oh, shut up!
Iliad will bring the sheen
back to your dog's coat...
Oh, my goodness, I remember
the first time I saw that picture.
I thought it was just wonderful.
When was that?
Let's see now, as I recall, your father
took me to see it at the old Majestic.
It was before we were married.
She must be about 150 by now!
As a matter of fact, dear,
I think Blanche Hudson is...
...just a few years older than I am.
Really?!
Yes, dear, "really."
Well, how come
we never see her around?
We've been living next door to them
for six months now...
...and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister slouching around.
Don't they ever have company?
I mean it must be awful.
You know, Julie says
that sister's kind of peculiar.
Did you ever notice that?
No, I never have.
Well, that's what Julie told me.
She said that she was supposed
to be responsible for the accident...
...that crippled her sister Blanche.
That all happened
a very long time ago, dear.
And maybe you shouldn't
pay too much attention...
...to everything that Julie Fowler
tells you.
There's too many people in this town
with nothing else to do but talk.
Maybe so, but Julie's folks
have lived here a long time.
I guess she should know.
Turn up the volume, dear.
We're missing the picture.
- Will you have a little champagne?
- No, thank you.
You wanna tell Poppa your troubles?
Somebody you love?
Oh, Jack, please try to understand.
I married you because...
...I was knocked silly
and it was a refuge.
I found out tonight that this boy's
in trouble, maybe alone.
It's blinding me.
I can't think of anything else...
Oh! He should've held that shot...
...Ionger.
I told him that when we were rehearsing,
also when it was shot!
But he wouldn't listen!
- Hiya?
- Swell.
It's still a pretty good picture.
...and Gemini...
Tommy, you don't have to stay here,
do you?
I'll just sit here.
Enjoying yourself?
Jane, what are you doing?
I was watching!
Then you're an idiot!
I won't have you speak to me like that!
Ah, the poor thing!
Poor baby.
Quiet down.
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hudson.
I hope I'm not intruding.
I just couldn't resist cutting
these flowers for your sister...
...after seeing her show yesterday.
You must be very proud
of her new success...
...on television, I mean.
I can't tell you how nice it is...
...to be seeing all of
her old pictures like this.
I'll tell 'er you said so.
You know, my daughter and I
would just love to meet her one day.
Perhaps she could...
Mrs. Bates,
my sister doesn't ever go out.
She's not fit to receive visitors.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.
I'd no idea that, well...
I hope she likes the flowers.
Thanks.
You miserable...
Oh, Jane, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.
I was just wondering who all those
people were at the back door.
Wasn't anything.
Just that nosey Mrs. Bates going on
about your picture last night.
Oh, really? Did she like it?
Oh, really? Did she like it?
She liked it.
I remember, when it first came out...
...it had a tremendous reception.
The critics described it as... brilliant!
Do you remember what year
you made that picture?
Well, of course, you must, too.
In 1934, right after I did "Moonglow."
I made a picture that year, too!
Oh, yes, it was that comedy
directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.
"The Longest Night."
Marty McDonald said
it was the best thing I ever did!
They never even released it
in the United States!
Feldman was very upset.
He told me the company had...
...a very bad year and
they couldn't afford...
No, they didn't!
They had a great year!
They didn't want to show my films.
They were too busy
giving a "big build-up"...
...to that crap you were turning out.
I'll clean the cage.
Oh, that would be Elvira.
Come in, Elvira!
- How are you today?
- Fine.
Oh, you've seen Jane.
I don't think she's feeling
very well today.
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby
about Ms. Jane like you said?
No, I haven't yet.
It's rather difficult.
I don't want to upset her again,
if I can help it.
But she'll be upset anyway,
Ms. Blanche.
And the longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna be.
I know.
But I was just hoping
it wouldn't be necessary.
I think she seems much better lately.
It's none of my business...
...but she's been drinkin' again.
You know that, don't ya?
No, I hadn't noticed.
Oh, I don't think
it does her any real harm.
I think I understand her.
Oh, you do, huh?
Well, then, you ought
to take a look at this.
What are these?
I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.
Oh, how kind people are.
You better look at them...
...and then you can tell me
whether or not you've seen them before.
- Did you read that?
- No.
But they've been opened.
That's right, they all have.
And there's one in here
marked "Personal."
"The other night my husband and I
watched that lovely movie of yours...
"...'Last Honeymoon.'
"I remember saying to my husband
at the time that seeing you again...
"...was just like
meeting an old friend."
Oh, that's charming.
That's really charming!
The point is, you never
saw them before, did you?
I thought not.
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.
But, I don't understand.
Where'd they come from?
Where'd you find them?
In the trash barrel, that's where!
They're from that television station...
...that's been running
your old movies, aren't they?
You mean Jane?
Who else?
Oh, well, she must have thought
they were advertisements.
Then why would she open
the one marked "Personal"?
And what about this?
You might as well see this, too.
Writing those dirty words!
I can even remember the last time
I saw words like that written down!
But, why would she do a thing like this?
You know what makes her
do things like this!
She's sick, and she's not
getting any better.
In fact, the last month
she's been getting a lot worse.
If you don't believe me, then...
...why are you selling this house
and planning to move out?
You said this last month...
...she's been a lot worse.
Do you think she knows?
About selling the house?
How could she?
You don't have anything in writing.
We're sisters, Elvira.
We know each other very well.
I think she's jealous...
...because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.
Anyway, in six weeks you'll have to
hand over the house and then...
...she'll have to know.
How do I tell her?
How?!
Well, if you'd just speak to that
Dr. Shelby, maybe he could tell her.
No, it ought to be me.
I can't let a stranger tell her.
But he's a doctor, Ms. Blanche.
And she's a sick woman.
Elvira, you didn't know her
when she was a child.
When she was young.
I've seen those pictures she keeps.
It wasn't that she was just pretty.
She was different.
She was so alive.
I was cleaning the cage.
The bird got out.
But where is it now?
It flew out the window.
You let that bird out
on purpose, Ms. Jane!
I just told ya, I was cleaning the cage
and the bird flew out the window.
I'm sorry!
She did that on purpose!
Believe me, she did it on purpose!
Never mind.
Maybe he'll come back.
You won't change your mind, will you?
I mean about coming to live with me?
You know I don't go back
on my word, Ms. Blanche.
But you've got to make up your mind
about finding somewhere for Ms. Jane...
...where they can
look after her properly.
I have made up my mind.
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.
I know, Ms. Blanche, I know.
It's just that I have to be sure...
...I'm doing the right thing for her.
Hello, is this Johnson's?
I want to order some liquor.
It's Jane Hudson.
Waddaya mean you can't fill
any more orders for me?
My sister did?
Well, wait a minute,
I'll put 'er on.
Blanche, would you speak
to this man from Johnson's?
Hello, who is this, please?
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.
What seems to be the trouble?
I'm afraid there's been some
misunderstanding.
I certainly didn't mean to suggest...
...that you shouldn't fill
any orders for her.
After all, we do pay
our bills, don't we?
Yes, fine.
Would you please?
I'll put her on.
Okay, then?
Good...
...I'd like to order six bottles
of Scotch and three bottles of gin.
The same brands,
and as soon as possible.
I just told Ms. Blanche. I'm going
downtown to see a man about jury duty.
I'll be back tomorrow.
"I've written a letter to Daddy.
"His address is heaven above.
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...
"...and wish you were with us to love.
"Instead of a stamp, I put kisses.
"The postman says...
"The postman says...
"...that's best to do.
"I've written a letter to Daddy...
"...saying, 'I...
"...Iove... you."'
"Now when I'm very good...
"...And do as I am told...
"...I'm Mama's little angel.
"And Papa says I'm good as gold.
"But when I'm very bad...
"...and answer back and sass...
"...then I'm Mama's little devil.
"And Papa says I've got the brass.
"Now I wish that you would tell me...
"...'cause I'm much too young
to know..."
All right, Blanche Hudson!
Ms. Big, Fat, Movie Star!
Ms. Rotten, Stinking Actress!
Press a button, ring a bell...
...and you think the whole damn world
comes running, don't you?!
Lunch, Ms. Hudson?
Why, certainly, Ms. Hudson!
I'm sure we can find something
appropriate for you, Ms. Hudson!
Oh, you brought my lunch.
A bit early, isn't it?
Then what were you ringing for?
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
something's wrong with the telephone.
Maybe it's been left off
the hook downstairs.
Is that so?
Who'd you wanna call, Blanche?
Well, actually I wanted
to call Bert Hanley.
Oh, our business manager?
There's something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.
Well, I'm afraid I have bad news...
about money.
You see the point is, Bert thinks
we'll probably have to sell the house.
Why should we have to
sell the house, Blanche?
Well, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.
Our financial position
is such that we just...
...we can't afford to...
We've got plenty of
money invested. I know.
Yes... yes, that's quite true, but...
...some of those investments
aren't paying much.
When did our business manager
tell you all this?
Early last week, I think.
He didn't call here last week.
I know that, too.
No, we didn't actually speak
on the telephone.
He wrote me a letter.
He didn't write you any letter either.
There hasn't been a letter
from his office since...
Yes, Jane, there has.
Oh, you're a liar! You're just a liar!
You always were!
Bert Hanley never wrote you any letter
and never called you on the phone...
...tellin' you to sell the house.
You called him four weeks ago
and told him to sell it!
I did nothing of the sort.
Don't you think I know everything
that goes on in this house?
You've been spying on me!
What do you think?!
You are disgusting!
After all I've done for you!
When all I'm trying to do is help.
Who are you tryin' to help, Blanche?
What were you plannin' to do with me
when you sold the house?
What'd you have in mind...
...some nice little place
where they could look after me?
Better not tire yourself out
using the phone anymore.
If there are any calls,
I'll take them downstairs.
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold!
Jane! Please wait.
Jane, I want to talk to you... please!
Jane, I want to talk to...
Telephone, mother.
All right, dear.
I called this morning and placed an ad.
Did we give you a reference number?
Oh, yeah.
Here it is.
You want to check the copy?
That's fine.
Did you want this to go in the
"Personal" column or in the want ads?
Well, I always think the "Personal"
column's nicer, don't you.
That's an eight-line ad.
That'll be $6.30.
Who's placing this ad?
We have to know.
Why, I am!
Yeah, I know, but who for?
You see, when you're placing
an advertisement for someone...
...to do a job for you, we have to
have your name for the record.
Well, my name is... Jane Hudson.
Maybe you remember me.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!
Sure.
Thank you. This will be
in the paper tomorrow.
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?
"Please call Dr. Shelby
at OL6-1656 and...
"...ask him to come
to the house immediately."
"Under no circumstances...
"...let my sister...
"...see the contents...
"...of this note.
"...Blanche Hudson."
Oh, Ms. Hudson, how nice to see you.
- I was just going to call on you.
- Why?
I just wanted to ask you about the
flowers I brought over for your sister.
I'm afraid they don't last very long
this time of year and...
...I thought perhaps
you'd like some more.
You could've saved yourself
the trouble.
Oh, but it's no trouble at all.
I've just been cutting some,
that's why I came over.
I always think it's so nice
to have flowers...
...in the house...
- Mrs. Bates!
I guess if my sister needed flowers,
we could afford to buy them!
What's the matter, Mother? You look
as though you've been in a fight.
I'm not sure that I haven't been.
Jane Hudson makes me so mad,
I could kill her!
That's a good idea.
What'll we use?
Did you have a nice drive?
What are you talking about?
Nothing, dear. It's been so long
since you were out of the house.
I though perhaps you'd gone
for a drive or something.
You know, I was thinking...
...it's been so long since
we had a talk...
...you know, a real talk
about the future and everything.
I didn't want you to be worried
about the house.
Even if I do have to sell it,
we'll still be together.
Blanche, you're not going
to sell this house.
Daddy bought this house.
And he bought it for me.
You don't think I remember that,
do you?
You're wrong, Jane.
You've just forgotten.
I bought this house for the two of us...
...when I signed my first contract.
You don't think I remember anything,
do you?
There're a whole lot of things
I remember.
And you never paid for this house.
Baby Jane paid for this house,
that's who!
You don't know what you're saying.
You aren't ever gonna
sell this house.
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it...
...either.
Do you remember when
I first came back after the accident?
You promised you wouldn't ever
talk about that again.
I know I did...
...but I'm still in this chair.
After all those years
I'm still in this chair.
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?
Jane, I'm just trying to explain
to you how things really are.
You wouldn't be able to do
these awful things to me...
...if I weren't still in this chair!
But you are, Blanche!
You are in that chair!
And tell me what are these awful things
I'm supposed to be doing to you?
Well I meant...
...you wouldn't have to work so hard.
And I was thinking maybe...
...maybe Elvira could come in
more often.
Maybe she could even live with us.
We don't need Elvira!
But you get so tired, you...
There's so much to do,
and you're not well.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should get
a check-up or something.
That would be wonderful!
Perhaps we can, we can find
a really good doctor.
We could get hold of that
nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?
Let's see...
...what's his number again?
"...Under no circumstances...
"...tell my sister the contents
of this note."
It's not me that needs
a doctor, Blanche!
Hello, lovey.
Now, don't stop for me.
What did the doctor say?
He says it's no use my trying
to go back to work for six months.
Didn't he even give you
anything new to take?
Oh, he says it's arthritis.
An' the only thing for me to do is
not to try an' work until it clears up.
Did he suggest what we're going
to use for money in the meantime?
No, dear.
But he's ever such a nice man.
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.
You know, we've still got
a bit of savings.
You're my little worrier.
That's nice.
You've found something, have you?
You don't have to get so excited.
You haven't even seen what it is yet.
No, dear but it's a possibility,
isn't it?
I mean, there aren't that many jobs
that'd be suitable...
...I mean for someone
with your qualifications.
What qualifications?
Well, you know... serious music
and that...
Oh, this sounds like
just the ticket, doesn't it?
- You're gonna call?
- Call who?
These people.
Might as well.
Now?
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use
calling next week, would it?
Mom, tell you what.
Why don't you call for me?
Tell them you're my secretary
or something.
All right, dear, I'll do that.
And listen, I won't let on who I am.
You see, I'll just tell 'em
I'm Mr. Flagg's "secketary."
- Secretary.
- Sec-re-tary.
Well, do you know...
...I do believe yer old mum'd...
...be a jolly good "secketary" at that.
Don't you think?
This is Jane Hudson.
Oh, about the ad!
Who is this?
This is Mr. Flagg's "secketary."
Oh, his secretary.
Mr. Flagg is very interested.
And he'd like to know if
he can have an appointment.
I think you'll find
he's very well qualified.
Well, sure, I'd be glad to give
Mr. Flagg an appointment.
Well, now, let me see...
...how 'bout 4:00 this afternoon?
I think that would be fine.
Well, I'll be expecting him then.
It's all fixed, lovey.
Ah, yer old mum's managed everything...
...hasn't she?
Oh, shut up!
What do you want this time?
Who was on the telephone?
None of your business!
What were you ringing for?
I'm hungry, Jane.
Well, of course you're hungry.
You didn't eat your dinner.
That's why you're hungry.
But you forgot my breakfast.
I didn't forget your breakfast.
I didn't bring your breakfast...
...because you didn't eat your din-din.
We're right back where we started.
When I was on the stage, you had
to depend on me for everything...
...even the food you ate
came from me.
Now you have to depend on me
for your food again.
So you see, we're right back
where we started.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Doing what?
Making me afraid to eat,
trying to make me starve myself.
Don't be silly.
If you starve, you die.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really must be sick!
Did you ever stop to think that...
...if anything happened to me,
I mean anything bad...
...there wouldn't be any money for you?
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.
You wouldn't even have pocket money.
Did you ever think of that?
I've thought about that.
Why didn't you eat your dinner?
Because I'm afraid.
You made me afraid.
I thought you were supposed to be
the big girl in this family.
Nothing wrong with it.
You're just a neurotic, Blanche!
D'you know that...
...you're just a neurotic?
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning.
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.
- I have to go now.
But just a little, please!
No. You didn't eat your din-din,
so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.
Jane, please... don't do this to me.
Jane! Please!
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning, Ms. Jane.
I wanna talk to you.
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,
so I was unkind to you.
I want to make it up.
I got up this morning
and fixed the house.
So you can have the whole day off.
Here's your $15.
Well, thanks, but does Miss...
What I mean, is...
...does Ms. Blanche know
about my taking the day off?
Oh, sure, she knows.
All right... if you say so.
See you next Tuesday then.
Have a good time.
Goodbye.
Bye!
Who was that at the door earlier?
Elvira.
Where is she now? In the kitchen?
No. I gave her the day off.
She has a pretty hard time, considering.
I told her to come back next week.
You know we got rats in the cellar?
Good afternoon.
Mr. Flagg?
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.
I have an appointment with
Ms. Hudson for 4:00 o'clock.
I'm Jane Hudson.
My, you're... you're right on time,
aren't you?
Yes, I believe I am.
Come in.
We can talk here in the living room.
Oh, I say... what a perfectly
charming room.
- So, you're Edwin Flagg?
- Yes, that's right.
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.
You must've guessed that I'm English.
Oh, really? How nice for you.
