"...and the raven,
never flitting,
still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust
of Pallas
just above my chamber door.
And his eyes have
all the seeming
of the demons
that he´s dreaming.
The lamplight streaming
throws his shadow
on the floor.
And my soul, from out that shadow,
that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted...
nevermore."
Pretty good, huh?
Okay.
Read The Legend
of SleepyHollow.

A teacher gets chased
by a headless demon.
Hi.
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing?
- They get fired.
- Thank God it´s Friday.
You sound
like my students.
Why don´t you
carry my books?
I hope you
haven´t made plans.
- Where are we going?
- It´s a surprise.
- Aaahhh!
- Aaahhh!
You okay?
- What´s wrong?
- I don´t know.
It didn´t used
to bother me.
Enjoy the ride, folks?
Take it away.
Do you want to come in?
I´d better not.
Are you all right?
I´m okay.
I had a wonderful time.
Are you sure you don´t want
to come in?
You could spend
the night here.
I´d better not.
Some things are
worth waiting for.
My books.
Johnny, wait!
I´m so crazy about you.
I´m going to marry you.
You better.
- Drive carefully.
- I will.
Where´s Intensive Care?
Johnny.
Johnny, don´t leave me,
please.
Johnny, you´re going to
get better. I know you are.
Can you hear me?
We´re going to get married.
Don´t leave me.
Hello, John.
My name´s Weizak.
I´m Dr. Sam Weizak.
I´m the director
ofthis clinic.
You´ve been
our guest for a while.
Guest?
That´s a funny way
of putting it.
How do you feel?
My throat hurts.
Try a little water.
Come.
Hey, slow down.
Not so fast.
Slow down.
You´ve been involved
in a terrible traffic accident.
Do you remember?
Am I okay?
Well...
you´ve been
smashed up pretty badly.
What is it?
No bandages.
How come?
Your parents are here.
They´re right next door.
I´ll bring them in now.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Do come in.
Hi, Mom, Dad.
John.
Johnny.
Johnny,Johnny.
It´s a miracle,John.
I know.
I was lucky. Look.
Not a scratch.
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs. Smith.
What is she
talking about?
Shh!
You´ve been in a coma,
Johnny. Not a trance.
Coma?
For how long?
We´re just glad
to have you back.
Dad, how long?
Five years.
Five long years,John.
Lost for five years.
And now reborn unto me.
Five... years?
What about Sarah?
Cast her
from your thoughts.
She´s turned
her back on you.
She cleaves now
unto another man,
a husband.
Husband?
Ahhh!
Aaahhh!
- Amy.
- Aaahhh!
Aaahhh!
Amy!
- Amy.
- Amy is my daughter´s name.
Your daughter´s screaming.
The house is burning.
Your daughter´s
in the house.
It´s not too late.
Amy.
Amy!
Aaahhh!
Your daughter
is screaming.
Amy´s screaming.
It´s not too late.
Hurry up!
First, we will get your body
back into shape.
Although you´ve
been exercised regularly,
the ligaments have shortened
a little.
Must I live
in a wheelchair?
Not permanently.
And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.
I, uh--
I won´t deceive you,John.
Your therapy will be
long and painful.
But you will walk.
Thankyou.
The wolf is loose.
John, are you all right?
No match for them.
Horses, fire.
Mamichka!
No!
The boy is safe.
The boy is safe.
John!
John!
Are you all right? Hmm?
Tell me...
what about the boy?
You keep saying,
"The boy is safe."
- What boy?
- You. You´re the boy.
I am the boy?
- She saved you. She´s alive, Sam.
- Who?
Your mother.
- No, that´s not possible.
- She survived.
John, my mother is dead.
She´s alive. I know her name
and where she lives.
But that is
not possible,John.
How could you know that?
How--
I´m scared, Sam.
What´s happening to me?
- Hello?
- Hello. May I speak to...
Yes?
- Is Johanna there, please?
- One moment.
Hello?
Who is this, please?
Hello?
Well...
you are either
in possession
ofa very new
human ability...
or a very old one.
-
- Yes?
Oh. Over here
will be fine.
Thankyou.
We´re trying to get you
back on your feet.
This should help you
regain your strength.
What´s on your mind?
You were right,John...
about my mother.
I got the number
from information.
It was in the phone book.
Did you talk to her?
No, I didn´t.
I, um--
She came to the phone,
but I just
couldn´t talk to her.
I hung up.
Why?
Why?
Because it wasn´t
meant to be.
It wasn´t meant to be.
Chug, chug, chug.
Come on. Keep it moving.
Weight down, knees up.
Keep it moving.
- That´s it.
- That´s it?
- That´s what I get, 8 lousy steps?
- I counted 1 0.
I´d like you to do
some serious chugging.
I´m going to run
around the building.
- Keep chugging?
- Okay.
See you.
Johnny.
They told me
you were outside.
I am.
I didn´t know
if I should come or not.
It´s all right.
You got your hair cut.
Yeah, a long time ago.
You lost weight.
They call it coma diet--
lose weight while you sleep.
You know I got married.
I heard that.
You´d like him.
You still teach?
Uh-uh. Mothering´s
a full timejob.
Kids, too?
I didn´t know that.
I´m sorry.
I thought your father
would have told you.
He´s a wonderful little boy.
His name´s Denny.
- How old is he?
- Ten months.
I´m glad foryou.
Don´t look at me
like that.
What am I going to do?
For you,
five years have passed.
For me, it´s the next day.
My feelings
haven´t changed yet.
Oh,Johnny.
Why did it
have to happen?
Bad luck.
I never should have
let you go that night.
It was my idea,
remember?
What a jerk.
Everybody´s
talking about you.
You´re the talk
ofthe town.
´Cause I got
my head bashed in
and I´m alive?
Because you have
the power of second sight.
Is it true,Johnny?
The papers
won´t let up about it.
I keep thinking
about a line
from The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,
the last thing I gave my class
before the accident.
Ichabod Crane disappears.
The line goes,
"As he was a bachelor
and in nobody´s debt,
nobody troubled their head
about him anymore."
Is that what
you´re afraid of?
That´s what I want.
That´s what I want.
I don´t approve.
The press
has been hounding me.
I want it over with.
Once you´ve set something
like this in motion,
it seems you never know
where it will lead.
It´s already in motion.
I want to stop it.
They put it out,
and that´s all there is.
Clement Dardis,
WJGE-TV.
What happened to the girl?
I understand she´s fine.
Well, uh...
would you call this
a psychic experience?
- No, I would not.
- Ever had one before?
No.
How about
a demonstration,John?
- A what?
- You know, a demonstration.
You got any predictions?
You think Greg Stillson
is going to unseat
Senator Proctor?
- Who?
- Greg Stillson.
Uh... thankyou, sir.
- No more.
- Wait, wait a minute!
How about the election?
I don´t even know
who you´re talking about.
Well, you didn´t know
anything about this nurse.
That was different.
Well, I--
I touched her hand.
Oh. All right.
All right!
Now, touch my hand.
Tell me,
is my house on fire,John?
- Shall I stop this?
- No.
You want to know
ifyou´re going to die?
We´ll all die. You want to know
ifyou´ll die tomorrow.
Is that right?
You want to know why
your sister killed herself.
All right.
Go on.
- It´s not all right.
- It´s okay.
It´s not okay.
Okay.
I won´t talk about that!
- Let go, you fucking freak!
- Please stop it!
Leave him alone!
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
You´re hurting him!
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.
Oh, yes, Nurse.
She knows you´re coming.
Doctor, thanks for
bringing the boy.
Herb?
It´s Johnny, Mom.
Ohh...Johnny.
Leave your boots
outside the door.
Don´t go tracking snow
all over the house.
I won´t.
You´re a good boy.
You´re wasting
your time here, Sheriff.
You know that,
don´t you?
Well, you never know, Frank.
It´s worth a try.
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah, I´m Herb Smith.
Sheriff Bannerman,
Castle Rock. May I come in?
Yeah, sure. Come in.
It´s a little nippy
out there.
- That´s a nice tree.
- Thanks.
May I do something
foryou, Sheriff?
Actually, I came
to see your son.
Are youJohn?
Sheriff Bannerman.
Castle Rock.
I´ve come to you
with what you
could call a proposal.
It concerns
the Castle Rock Killer.
- Have you heard of him?
- Sure.
I don´t know whether
it´s true or not,John...
about these psychic
powers ofyours.
If it´s true,
I could use your help.
Maybe you should
give him--
Think about it,
but bear in mind
some decent young women
from homes just like this
have met with terrible,
terrible deaths.
Now, I´m at my wits´ end.
I´ve exhausted about every
approach to this situation.
I´ve come up with nothing.
I feel you can help me.
You made a mistake.
I was sorry to hear
about your mother´s death.
I understand
she was a good woman,
Christian woman.
I´m not a religious man,
I´m sorry to say,
but if God has seen fit
to bless you with this gift,
you should use it.
Bless me?
You know
what God did for me?
He threw a truck at me,
bounced me into nowhere
for five years!
My girl was gone,
myjob was gone,
my legs are useless.
Bless me?
God´s been a real sport to me.
All right,John.
Ifyou change your mind,
you know where I am.
Merry Christmas to you.
Well?
Well what?
See? What did I tell you?
Them murders,
god-awful things.
Went on during the time
you were in that coma.
Don´t have the knack
for tinsel.
It was your mother who kept
the tree looking good.
I wish to God
she was here now
so she could talk to you
about this thing.
I´m not much help to you.
Sure you are.
You, uh, want
to talk about it?
Not that much to say.
It don´t bring you
much happiness.
When it happens...
when the spells come,
it feels like--
I don´t know.
It feels like
I´m dying... inside.
No snow.
It should snow
for Christmas.
Hi.
I brought you a visitor.
I didn´t know
you were coming.
I wasn´t sure myself.
If I´d known
you were coming,
I´d have cleaned up.
You look wonderful.
You lost the crutches, I see.
Yeah.
I still got the limp.
Is your father home?
He won´t be back till later.
Is that who I think it is?
His Majesty.
- Danny?
- Denny.
Say hi.
Denny.
It´s cold.
Come on in.
He´s asleep.
Last time
we were alone together,
you said some things
were worth waiting for.
Well...
haven´t we waited
long enough?
Charlene MacKenzie´s
got Dad building things.
Ifyou ask me, it´s the company
she wants more than the bookcases.
I heard that.
That´s a boy.
There you are,
young fella.
I made that when
John was born.
It´s an excellent chair.
What have you two
been up to all day?
Making bookcases.
Sit down.
Dinner´s ready.
That smells good.
I´m starved.
- I hope you like it.
- He´s fed up with my cuisine.
For our bounty,
may the Lord make us grateful.
Amen.
It feels good
to have a family
eating around
this table again.
Will I see you again?
Not like today.
Go inside,
you´re freezing.
- It doesn´t have to--
- Don´t say it.
Don´t say it,Johnny.
I´ll just say good night.
Guess I´ll hit the hay.
I´m going to watch TV.
Good night, son.
Despite efforts
of police forces,
the killer i sat large,
and is likelyto remain so.
We spoke to
Sheriff Bannerman
outside the courthouse.
We have no newleads
at this time.
However, there is the hope
thatsome citizen might
havesome information
that wouldbe very helpful.
My line is open.
I´d welcome anyhelp
we canget.
That´sallIhave to say.
Nine murders
have been attributed
to the Castle Rock Killer,
dating back almost 3 1/2years.
The most recent victim
was 15 year old
Debbie Linderman,
a sophomore at
Castle RockHigh School.
Her partially cladbody
wasfoundone month ago today.
Asin the other
Castle Rockkillings,
cause of death was
multiple stab wounds.
Next on News Eight,
sportsand weather
with Ron,
afterthismessage.
I´m going to help.
What?
The sheriff
that came here...
Bannerman.
I´m going to help him.
We think the killer
hid down at the end
of the tunnel there.
When the girl
came through,
the bastard was
waiting for her.
Kids shouldn´t
come through here,
but they use this
as a short cut to school.
He stood right here.
Found a lot ofcigarette butts,
same brand.
Eight or nine butts here.
This help you any?
I don´t know.
Have you got something
he might have touched
or worn?
Frank, give me
that package.
It´s our only real evidence.
Found it in the bushes
back there.
Same brand as the butts.
Here.
Nothing.
I thought I´d
feel something, but--
Can´t say we didn´t try.
Dispatch to
SheriffBannerman.
Yeah, this is Bannerman.
Wegot anotherbody.
Oh...
damn it!
What´s the word?
- Is it the Castle Rock Killer?
- Hey, Sheriff!
What´s the word
about the robbery?
That´s the psychic,
isn´t it?
Give us a break.
We´re trying
to do a story here.
You´ll just have to wait.
Looks pretty grim to me.
Anyone know who she is?
Dodd?
I know her.
Alma Frechette.
She works at
the Coffee Pot Cafe.
Was this psychic
your idea, George?
Get these people out of here.
Move them back.
Move the people back.
Knock it offwith
those cameras. No more.
- Dodd!
- Yeah?
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, Sheriff.
You want to try?
Hey, Alma!
Hi.
What are you doing?
Waiting for
a smile from you.
She knows him.
What?
She knows him.
Why waste a smile on you?
You want to see
the damndest thing?
- What?
- Come up to the gazebo.
She knows him.
Not scared.
She knows him.
All right.
What did you
want to show me?
Gazebo.
You like that word, Alma?
Come here.
Look at this.
Jesus! Let go!
- Is this your idea ofa joke?
- Nojoke.
No, no! Wait!
You all right?
Dodd, give me a hand.
I saw him.
I was there.
- I saw his face.
- Who?
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl. Dodd!
- What are you saying?
- I did nothing.
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl.
- What are you saying?
- Dodd!
I stood there.
I did nothing.
Dodd?
Dodd, get up here!
He took off in your car.
I saw his face.
I saw his face.
You stay there.
Sheriff.
I told you
to stay by the car.
Who´s there?
I want to talk
to your son, Mrs. Dodd.
He ain´t here.
His patrol car
is out here.
His car´s here.
He ain´t.
I saw him
in the window.
- He ain´t home!
- I´m coming in.
No!
Leave my boy alone!
You knew.
Didn´t you?
You knew.
You--
You´re a--
You´re a devil...
sent from hell!
Yes.
Yes.
Frank?
- No!
- Aaah!
Ahhh!
Hello,John.
May I come in?
How did you find me?
My father?
Stopped offto see him.
He said you moved
to a new town.
He´s worried about you.
And so am I.
Don´t worry.
I´m taking care of myself.
It´s about time.
I´m still your doctor.
You´re still under my care.
We have to...
well, stay in touch.
Well--
How´s the, uh--
All healed up now?
The bullet...
went right through me.
- It´s nothing.
- Good.
Nice place you have here.
It´s home.
Those headaches
are getting worse, aren´t they?
Three, four times
a day sometimes.
I brought you
some new medication.
No! No more pills.
It takes time to recover.
The healing process is slow.
I´m not getting better.
I´m getting worse.
Isn´t that right?
All right.
Now listen.
I´ve done some research
into the area
of psychic phenomena.
Several cases, such as yours,
have been documented.
I was surprised
to discover.
And the pattern
is always the same.
As the spells,
the visions,
grow stronger
and more powerful,
the body weakens.
I don´t need any research
or documentation
to see this thing is
sucking the life out ofyou.
One look tells me that.
You mean I´m going to die?
How long?
I think we can
arrest the process,
reverse it even.
- How?
- Come back with me.
- Where?
- To the clinic.
No. Absolutely no.
John, please.
You must!
So you can study me?
No. So I can
protect you.
You need to be in
a controlled environment,John.
I want to
show you something.
Come with me.
Cards and letters
keep pouring in.
What is all this?
It´s people with lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.
You haven´t
even opened them.
I don´t have to.
They all want reassurance,
help, love...
things I can´t give them.
Father sends it.
I let it pile up.
Why do you keep it?
This is why
I can´t go out...
live my life,
why I stay
locked up here.
I´m already living in
a controlled environment, Sam.
Nothing can touch me here.
I´m alone.
I´m safe.
"But instead of dying,
she shall only
fall into...
a profound sleep
which shall last
a hundred years."
-
- That´s my mom.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
John Smith?
Hi. I´m Roger Stuart.
I´d like to talk to you.
Sit down.
What can I do foryou?
Um... it´s, uh--
It´s my boy,
my son, Chris.
He needs help.
I´ve inquired around.
You come highly recommended.
What´s the matter with him?
I wish I knew.
He´s bright,
I know he is,
but he won´t
take part in school.
He won´t join in.
He won´t learn.
God! He´s so shy.
You thinkyou
could help him?
I wouldn´t know
unless I met him.
He wouldn´t
come with me today.
You´d have to come out
to the house.
No. That´s out
ofthe question.
It´s just not
the way I do it.
It won´t work otherwise.
Please.
He´ll get to know you,
then you can bring
him here for the lessons.
Please.
Okay.
Great. Tomorrow
morning´s Saturday.
I´ll send a car
to pickyou up.
Thankyou.
That reminds me ofwhen
I ran for the senate.
My opponent
went to the ghetto
and handed out dollar bills
trying to buy votes.
I said,
"You folks keep that money
´cause times is rough.
But I want you to vote
for whoeveryou please."
- We won by... what?
- 29.
Those people spent that money
with a clear conscience.
John, good morning.
Nice to see you.
Gentlemen, meet my son´s tutor,
John Smith.
- This is Greg Stillson.
- Hello.
- This gentleman is--
- Sonny Elliman.
Well, Greg,
you got some good ideas.
Let me think about them.
Roger, I want you
to be part ofthis.
I need your support,
your expertise, your input.
And most importantly,
I need your money.
- God bless, Roger.
- Thanks for dropping by.
See you. Bye-bye.
My God!
What a glorious day!
Amen.
Sorry about that.
Well, let´s go see Chris.
Chris.
This is Johnny.
Remember I said
he was coming?
I´ll leave you alone
to get acquainted.
Your father wants me
to bring you
out of your shell.
I don´t know what to do.
You don´t have
to do anything.
My dad lives in a shell,
not me.
Chris has really
taken to you,John.
- You made progress.
- We just talked.
Well, with Chris,
that´s an achievement.
You want a drink?
- No.
- Want a beer?
- Okay.
- Get him a beer.
Let´s listen to this.
I´m Greg Stillson,
just stopping by
on my wayto the U.S. Senate.
Greg Stillson.
Remember you met him
this morning?
...you got to be
in good shape
togo the full distance
with those boys in Washington.
What the hell is happening
to this country?
Can anybody tell me?
I read in a local paper--
Do you believe this guy?
He´s just getting
warmed up.
You voting for him?
I´m not even registered.
- Not registered?
- No.
Get registered, pal,
and vote against this turkey.
He´s dangerous.
...I see so many unemployed.
Why are you people here
in the middle of the day?
Look at each other!
How do you feel?
Would you send your friend
to the U.S. Senate?
A real man of the people.
Jesus, what an act.
Can´t they see
through this guy?
You acted like friends
this morning.
With guys like Stillson,
you walk a thin line.
If they lose,
they´ll drag you down.
But if he wins,
and this turkey just might,
you make sure you´re thought of
as a good friend.
Know what I mean?
...I´vegot ajob foreveryone
anda challenge for all of you!
I´m challenging you
to join me,
to join a growing army
of volunteer workers
on my campaign.
Let´s send Greg Stillson
to the U.S. Senate
and mediocrity to hell!
What can I do foryou boys?
You work late.
That´s admirable.
I´m Greg Stillson.
I know who you are,
Mr. Stillson.
Take your paid gorilla
and get out.
We´ve got a little problem here.
Get to the point,
Mr. Stillson.
I´m damned near even
in the polls.
The people need me.
I´m going to win big.
I´ve had a vision
that I´m going to be President
ofthe United States someday.
I´ve accepted
that responsibility,
and nobody,
will stop me.
Imagine how I felt
when I read your editorial
that´s hitting
the streets tomorrow.
You don´t seem
to like me, Brenner.
But that´s okay.
I don´t like you either.
How did you get that?
I´m not at liberty
to reveal my sources.
It doesn´t make
any difference.
That editorial is hitting
the streets tomorrow morning.
Not if we make a deal.
What´s that mean?
You staying out of
the campaign business,
and me staying out
of the publishing business.
Show him what
we´ve got to publish.
That´s your best shot.
I got many loyal people
on my side--
Like that lady in
the photograph with you.
I never met Mrs. Brenner,
but I´m sure
that ain´t her.
What do you think, Sonny?
Is this Mrs. Brenner?
- Doesn´t look like her.
- You son ofa bitch!
Who you calling
a son of a bitch?
Let´s give
Mr. Brenner a chance
to think about
his wife, kids,
his position
in the community.
What if I don´t make a deal?
You´ll make a deal.
Otherwise Sonny
will take your head off.
Good idea.
I told you he was
a reasonable man.
He´s a nice man.
I like your wife too.
"Prophets, said I,
thing ofevil.
Prophets still
of bird or devil,
by that heaven
that bends above us,
by that God
we both adore,
tell this soul
with sorrow laden,
ifwithin
the distant Aden,
it shall clasp
a sainted maiden
whom the angels
named Lenore."
Skip to the part
where he talks about,
"Will I ever
see her again?"
"Eagerly I wish the morrow.
Vainly I had sought
to borrow
from my books,
surcease of sorrow,
sorrow for
the lost Lenore.
For the rare
and radiant maiden
whom the angels
named Lenore,
nameless here forevermore."
Stop. I´ll be right back.
Good afternoon, sir.
We´re out talking
about Greg Stillson.
You´re familiar
with our candidate?
What do you think?
Yeah, right.
Are you aware ofwhat
Greg Stillson stands for?
Greg Stillson´s mounting
a successful third party movement.
Stillson represents
both the poor and the well-off.
Could you come back?
I have a student.
Sure. You´re busy.
Can I leave some literature?
Honey, bring some brochures!
Hello,Johnny.
Hi.
You live here?
Yeah. I´m back to teaching.
This is my husband Walt.
Nice to meet you
finally,John.
Sarah´s talked
about you often.
Come on back,Johnny.
It´s no fun reading alone.
Chris,
Walt and Sarah.
Hi.
We´ll let you
get back to work.
Nice to meet you.
Don´t forget
who to vote for.
Bye.
Who was that?
Hey.
You okay?
Why are you crying,
Johnny?
Johnny?
What´s the matter?
- Nothing.
-
- My ride´s here.
- I´m going with you.
- I got to talk to you.
- Hi,Johnny.
- What are you doing?
- Pretty good stuff, huh?
I organized
a hockey team.
We´re practicing this afternoon.
I´m the coach.
Call it off.
There´s going
to be an accident.
Call it off?
Chris is looking forward to this.
- He´s really coming out,John.
- Wait.
I got to talk to you.
Eat something,
then we´ll go.
There´s going to be an accident.
Call it off.
We skate on that pond
until March.
You´ll kill your own son!
I´m scared, Dad.
For Christ sake,John!
Don´t be scared.
Go eat.
Don´t you know who I am?
You think I´d hire you
without checking you out?
I hired you as a teacher,
not a fortuneteller.
The ice is going to break!
I want you out.
I don´t want you
in my boy´s life!
You do exactly
what I´m telling you!
No, Dad.
You don´t know.
It´s not safe.
All right.
To hell with it!
Forget everything,
but I want you out.
Whateveryou say.
I´m sorry about that.
I´ll send your final check.
I´m not crazy, you know.
Don´t let the boy
think I am.
I´m right about this.
But we´ll never know,
will we?
Give me your hand.
Nothing to worry about now.
My driver will
take you home.
You were right.
I´ll see you.
Chris?
Hey, what´s going on?
You´re not even dressed.
You called it off.
I thought you
called it off.
Just to get rid of him.
We going or not?
Are you going
to pout like a baby
or come and play hockey
with your friends?
Great.
Hello.
Who is it?
Johnny.
- Sarah, see you down there.
- Okay.

Good to see you.
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.
Hi. How are you?
How you doing?
Good to see you.
Do it, General.
You´re insane.
I won´t.
Do it! You´ll go down
in history with me!
As what? The world´s
greatest mass murderers?
You cowardly bastard!
You´re not the voice
ofthe people!
The people speak through me!
It came to me while I slept--
my destiny.
I must get up now
and fulfill my destiny!
Put your hand on that,
or I´ll hack it off!
Do it!
May God forgive me.
Congratulations, General.
Complete the sequence,
Mr. President.
My destiny.
Thankyou, Sonny.
Let them come up.
Mr. President, we have
a diplomatic solution.
Mr. Vice President,
Mr. Secretary,
the missiles are flying.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
You okay, Greg?
Get out!
Stillson! Stillson!
Stillson! Stillson!
Stillson! Stillson!
Ifyou could go back
in time to Germany,
before Hitler came to power,
knowing what you know now,
would you kill him?
Is that why
you sent for me,
to ask me this, uh...
this question?
I have to talk
to you, Sam,
because I´ve had
another episode.
Oh, yes?
Go on.
I´ve been tutoring
this boy named Stuart.
In the vision,
I saw him drown.
But that´s
not the point.
In the vision,
something was missing.
How-- How do you mean?
It was like... a blank spot,
a dead zone.
First ofall, tell me,
did the boy in fact drown?
His father wanted him
to play hockey.
I talked him out of it.
The boy´s alive.
Ah. Yes.
Don´t you see
how clear it is?
Not only can you
see the future, you can--
- I can change it.
- You can change it, exactly.
Here.
Yes,John.
That is your-- your dead zone.
The possibility of...
ofaltering the outcome
ofyour premonitions...
it´s fascinating.
Let me make a note.
What about my question?
Huh?
Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler?
- What would you do?
- I don´t like this.
What are you getting at?
What would you do?
Would you kill him?
All right.
All right.
I´ll give you an answer.
I´m a man of medicine.
I´m expected to save lives
and ease suffering.
I love people.
Therefore,
I would have no choice
but to kill
the son ofa bitch.
You´d never get away alive.
It doesn´t matter.
I would kill him.
Nasdrovia. Skol.
"Dear Sarah,
It is a hard letter to write,
so I´llmake it short.
Ican´t go on hiding anymore.
That´s what I´ve been doing--
running and hiding.
I had this
figured out all wrong.
I always thought
my power wasa curse,
but now Ican see it´s a gift.
By the time you get this letter,
it´ll be all over.
You never will understand why.
Nobody ever will,
but I know what I´m doing.
And I know I´m right.
Just remember there´s never
been anyone forme except you.
Just wasn ´t in the cards
forus, Iguess.
I´ll always love you,
Sarah.
Johnny. "
How you doing?
Thanks very much.
What´s your name?
Greg, my husband Walt.
Hi, Walt.
This your baby?
Bring him up on stage.
I want to thank you
for the support
you´ve given this campaign.
You made this campaign
the most exciting,
the most important campaign
in this state´s history.
I´ve come here personally
to thank you for that.
Johnny!
Give me him!
Don´t!
No!
Sonny! The man´s
trying to kill me!
You son of a bitch!
Who sent you?
Huh?
It´s over.
You´re finished.
Where´s that kid
with the camera?
I don´t see him.
You asshole!
It´s okay.
It´s all right.
Oh,Johnny, why?
Why?
Good-bye.
I love you.
