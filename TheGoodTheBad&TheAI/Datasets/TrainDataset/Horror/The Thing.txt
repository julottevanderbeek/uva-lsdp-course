Your move:
Bishop to knight four.
My move:
Knight to rook three.
Poor baby, you're startin'
to lose it, aren't ya?
Your move:
King to rook one.
My move:
Rook to knight six.
Checkmate. Checkmate.
You cheatin' bitch.
Childs,
what's he doin'?
Circling the camp.
Who is he?
Said "Norge" or something
on the side.
It's Norwegian.
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Are you?
Yeah.
What's going on there?
Watch it.
Easy.
Easy, easy, easy.
Yes.
First goddamn week
of winter.
Oh, come on. Four stitches.
Barely grazed ya.
What were they doin'
flyin' that low,
shooting at a dog,
at us?
Mmm, stir-crazy.
Cabin fever.
Who knows?
U.S. Number 31,
calling McMurdo.
Come in. Over.
U.S. Number 31,
calling McMurdo.
Urgent.
Come in. Over.
Great.
Come on, come on.
Nobody!
Nobody.
Get a hold of somebody.
Get a hold of anybody.
We gotta report this mess.
Look, I haven't been able
to reach shit in two weeks.
I doubt if anybody's
talked to anybody
on this entire continent,
and you want me
to reach somebody!
Maybe we're at war
with Norway.
El Capitan...
was gonna get a chance
to use his popgun.
How long've they
been stationed there?
It says here only eight weeks.
Bullshit, bwana.
Five minutes is enough
to put a man over down here.
I mean, look at Palmer.
He been the way he is
since the first day.
How many
in their party?
They started with ten.
There'd be eight others left.
How do we know?
Guys as crazy as that
could have done...
a lot of damage to their own
before they got to us.
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes there is.
I wanna go up.
In this weather?
Bennings?
Winds are gonna let up
a tad next couple of hours.
A tad?
Can't condone it
much myself,
but it is a short haul.
An hour there,
an hour back.
Shit, Doc,
I'll give you the lift.
No problem.
Hey, thanks for thinking
about it though.
Loaded with kerosene.
I count 15 cans.
MacReady!
Mac, get your gear on!
Mac, it may not clear up
for a week.
Yeah.
We're the closest ones
to 'em.
It's all right by me, Doc.
I'm just lettin' you know
we're takin' a chance.
Quit the griping, MacReady.
Those clouds keep movin'
over the sun, we're gonna get
a whiteout.
We get caught in that,
you can scratch one doctor
and one pilot.
This is real thin. It'll clear
as soon as you get up.
It's up to you, Mac.
If you don't wanna fly,
we don't fly.
You really wanna save
those crazy Swedes, huh?
Norwegians.
Which way, Doc?
Southwest.
You're gonna have
to read the map.
Mac's really taking
it up, huh?
He knows
what he's doin'.
Nauls, will you turn
that crap down?
I'm trying to get some sleep.
I was shot today.
Read, bwana.
Will do.
#Writing's on the wall #
#Very superstitious #
Anybody there?
Hey, Sweden!
They're not Swedish, Mac.
They're Norwegian.
Mac!
My God.
What the hell
happened here?
Come on, Doc.
- Portable video unit.
Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.
What are you doin', Doc?
Could be important work.
I wanna take it back.
Well, it's gettin' late.
Let's hurry it up.
Maybe they found a fossil,
the remains of some animal
buried in the ice,
and they chopped it out.
But where is it?
Look at this.
Is that a man in there
or something?
Whatever it is,
they burned it up
in a hurry.
Help me find
a shovel, Doc.
We found this.
Jesus Christ.
Did you reach
anybody yet?
Reach anybody?
We're a thousand miles
from nowhere, man,
and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.
Well, stick to it, Windows.
Stick to it.
Nothin' wrong
with this Norwegian,
physiologically anyway.
No drugs, no alcohol.
Nothing.
Hmm?
Well, what we got here
is what appears to be,
anyway,
a normal set
of internal organs.
Heart, lungs,
kidneys, liver.
Intestines.
Seem to be normal.
One, door number two
and door number three.
And I think that Dawn Screen
here has got the one
to trade in the most.
I went to you first.
You brought your friend Anna.
I know how this one ends.

Clark, will you put
this mutt with the others
where he belongs?
Yeah, okay.
Go ahead.
I don't know what
the hell's in there,
but it's weird and pissed off,
whatever it is.
Bennings, go get Childs.
What is this?
What's goin' on?
Hey, Palmer,
what is this?
I don't know.
Mac wants the what?
That's what he said.
Now, move!
Damn it.
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?
- Don't! No!
- Get away!
Get back! Get back!
Get your ass
over here!
Burn it.
Damn it, Childs.
Torch it!
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Oh!
Look.
Son of a bitch. Oh.
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,
When this Thing
attacked our dogs,
it tried to digest 'em,
absorb them,
and in the process,
shape its own cells
to imitate them.
This, for instance...
That's not dog.
We got to it before
it had time to finish.
Finish what?
Finish imitating
these dogs.
Easy, easy.
Good.
Easy, easy.
Clark.
Yeah?
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?
Strange? No.
What was the dog doin'
in the rec room?
I don't know.
He was just wandering
around camp all day.
Right.
How long were you alone
with that dog?
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?
I don't know.
What?
I don't know.
It's probably nothin'.
How much more
of this crap
is there?
Oh, about nine hours,
I'd say.
We can't learn
anything from this.
Seems like they were spendin'
a lot of their time...
in a little place
northeast of their camp
about five or six miles.
Here. This is it.
The place where they were
spendin' most of their time.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.
Thirty-five knots.
Screw it.
I'm gonna go up anyway.
Half a mile
due east.
Jesus, how long do you
figure this has been
in the ice?
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...
from way down around here
for a long time.
I'd say...
I'd say the ice it's buried in
is 100,000 years old, at least.
And those Norwegians
blew it up?
Yeah.
Thousands of years ago,
it crashes,
and this Thing...
Gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing
in the ice.
I just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullshit.
They're fallin'
outta the skies like flies.
Do you believe any
of this voodoo bullshit,
Blair?
Chariots OfThe Gods,
They practically own
South America.
I mean,
they taught the Incas
everything they know.
Come on, now, MacReady.
The Norwegians get a hold
of this, and they dig it up
out of the ice.
Yes, Garry,
they dig it up.
They cart it back.
It gets thawed out, wakes up,
not in the best of moods.
I don't know. I wasn't there.
Which one of you
disrespectful men...
been tossin' his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?
From now on I want
my kitchen clean, germfree.
Now how's this motherfucker
wake up after thousands
of years in the ice?
And how could it
look like a dog?
I don't know how.
'Cause it's different
than us, see?
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me?
Ask him.
You buy  of this,
Blair?
Be there
in a minute, Doc.
Through the door.
Right over here.
Right over...
Sorry, Mac. You have
to move your stuff ou...
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here
and lock him up.
I have to talk to you.
I'm tired of talkin',
Fuchs.
I just wanna
get up to my shack
and get drunk.
Mac, it's important.
What is it?
Outside.
It's 40 below outside.
In the Thiokol.
Please, Mac.
Can't burn the find
of the century.
That's gonna win somebody
the Nobel Prize.
You, uh,
got the keys?
Get 'em from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff
outta here.
There's something wrong
with Blair.
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.
So I took one of his notebooks
from the lab.
Yeah?
Listen.
"It could have imitated
a million life-forms
on a million planets.
"Could change into
any one of them
at any time.
Now it wants life-forms
on Earth."
It's gettin' cold in here,
and I haven't slept in days.
Wait. "It needs
to be alone...
"and in close proximity
with a life-form
to be absorbed.
The chameleon strikes
in the dark."
So is Blair cracking up,
or what?
Damn it, MacReady.
"There is still
cellular activity
in these burned remains.
They're not dead yet."
Let's go, Bennings.
I gotta get some sleep.
Holy shit.
Go get the doc.
I'll get Garry.
We'll meet
in Blair's room.
It's Bennings!
Windows! Windows!
Keep away from him!
Get back!
Stay back!
It isn't Bennings.
My God, what was
happening to him?
If it had more time
it would have looked, sounded
and acted like Bennings.
I don't know
what you're saying.
That was one
of those Things out there
trying to imitate him, Garry.
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.
I've known him for ten years.
He's my friend.
We've gotta burn
the rest of'em.
All right, step back.
You sure that's
all of'em?
We cleaned out
the storehouse, the lab.
There is nothin' left.
Where's Blair?
I can't find Blair.
Where's everybody else?
Windows is in the radio room
still trying to get through.
Everyone else, in the rec room.
Well, you go on.
I'll be in in a minute.
Blair?
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes,
I'll kill 'em.
- Jesus.
He smashed up some
of the chopper pretty good.
Childs, go see if he got
to the tractor.
You guys think I'm crazy.
Well, that's fine.
Most of you don't know
what's goin' on around here.
Well, I'm damn well sure
some of you do.
Christ.
He got most of the chopper
and the tractor, and he's
killed the rest of the dogs.
Garry, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Now, Childs, go around
to the map room door.
Talk to him.
Okay.
Norris, get a table
from the lab.
Do you think that Thing
wanted to be an animal?
No dogs make it
a thousand miles
through the cold.
Nah, you don't
understand!
That Thing wanted
to be us.
Okay, Blair.
I'll kill you.
Good shot,
MacReady.
Excuse me.
Okay.
All right,
bring him up.
Yeah.
Come on, Blair.
What about your shack?
I don't want him in my shack.
We'll lock him in the toolshed.
Why am I in here?
For your own protection,
Blair.
How you doin', old boy?
I don't know
who to trust.
I know what you mean, Blair.
Trust's a tough thing
to come by these days.
Tell you what.
Why don't you just
trust in the Lord?
Watch Clark.
What?
I said, watch Clark.
And watch him close.
Do you hear me?
