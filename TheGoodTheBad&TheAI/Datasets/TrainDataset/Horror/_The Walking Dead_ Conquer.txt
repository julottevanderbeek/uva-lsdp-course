Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...
You can't do anything,
you can't help me
I see a vibrant community here.
That's why I want
Maggie working with me.
Rick, his group,
they don't deserve this.
She's on her way out,
we need to get her there.
I know what you did,
and it's not gonna happen again.
Are you threatening me?
Dammit, Rick, I said stop!
Or what?
You gonna kick me out?
Uh!
Looks good.
Hi.
Hello.
You can lower that.
What's the W for?
You know, the first
settlers here,
they put bounties
on wolves' heads.
Brought the natives into it.
Made them hunt them.
Didn't take them too long
to kill them all.
They're back now.
Thoughts?
Everything gets a return.
- Are you shitting me?
- No, I shit you not.
I like this.
Just talking.
I don't get to meet
new people very often.
Maybe once every two weeks.
- That's a lot.
- Oh, I work at it.
We do.
Sometimes we find camps.
We run through them.
But we have traps, too.
It's different.
It's not like meeting like this.
As equals.
Little chats in front of
a fire with a stranger.
That's the closest thing
to movies now.
I miss the movies.
I used to--
put that down.
Why?
'Cause I want it.
I want everything you have.
Every last drop.
Can I keep a little of it?
Just to get me through
a day or two?
You know, just to keep me alive?
I'm taking you, too.
And you're not exactly
gonna be alive.
Okay.
You can have my supplies.
You can have everything.
I will not allow that.
Don't move.
Just be still.
Just be still.
Morgan:
No.
Just go.
Please.
Now!
Michonne:
You were here the whole time?
All night.
What's so funny?
It's-- it's like
the train car.
After the whole thing,
I'm still there.
Rosita patched you up.
Carl came by for a while.
I sent him home.
Rick.
What are you doing?
We put Pete in another house.
You could have told me
what was happening.
It moved fast.
And then Noah.
I couldn't tell you
about the gun.
No, you couldn't.
Oh, you wanted this place.
We had to stop being out there.
Well, we're here.
Well, you just said you weren't.
Michonne:
Carol: You took it, right?
From the armory?
That was stupid.
Why did you do it?
Just in case.
Glenn: Deanna's planning
to have a meeting tonight.
For anyone who wants to.
- To kick Rick out?
- To try.
We don't know that.
At the meeting,
you say you were worried
about someone being abused and no
one was doing anything about it.
that Jessie was safe from a man
who wound up attacking you.
You say you'll do
whatever you want them to.
Just tell them a story
that they want to hear.
It's what I've been doing
since I got here.
Why?
Because these people
are children
and children like stories.
What happens after
all the nice words
and they still try
to kick him out?
They're guarding the armory now.
We still have knives.
Well, tonight at the meeting,
if it looks like it's going bad,
I whistle.
Carol grabs Deanna,
I take Spencer,
you grab Reg, Glenn and Abraham
cover us, watch the crowd.
- We can talk to them.
- Yeah, we will.
If we can't get through,
we take the three of them
and say we'll slit
their throats.
Like at Terminus?
No, we just tell 'em.
They give us the armory
and it's over.
Did you want this?
No.
I hit my limit.
I-- I screwed up.
And here we are.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just gonna sleep some more.
Reg:
What do you need
to talk about, Maggie?
The meeting tonight.
Maggie, if we could talk--
I want to talk to everyone
about what happened
and what we need to do about it.
If it includes
sending Rick away,
it's not gonna work.
Tell me what that means.
You let Rick in.
You let all of us in.
You talked to us.
You decided.
And now you want
to put that decision
on a group of very
frightened people
who might not have
the whole story.
That's not leadership.
Tonight is just a forum.
It's just for people
to say their piece.
And I'll make the decision as
I've done since the beginning.
He was frustrated.
The things he's seen.
The things he's lost.
The things we have all lost.
The things you've lost?
We've lost so much more.
Rick took a gun and he
pointed it at people.
He didn't pull the trigger.
That's a metric? That he
didn't pull the trigger?
- Yes.
- Michonne stopped him, Deanna.
Michonne did.
I'm gonna do what
I have to do, Maggie.
Maggie.
Look, Maggie.
The cavemen,
they were all nomads.
And they all died.
Then we evolved into this
and we lived.
Civilization starts
when we stop running.
When we live together.
When we stop sending people away
from the world
and from each other.
That's what I'm going
to tell her.
That's what I'm going
to tell everyone.
Okay?
Somebody came through
here a while ago.
If we see them, we hang back,
set up the mike,
watch and listen.
For how long?
Until we know.
We have to know.
You've sent people away?
Yeah.
What happened?
It was early on.
It was three people.
Two men and a woman.
Davidson was their leader.
Smart as hell, strong.
I thought they'd work out.
They didn't.
I brought them in
and I had to see them out.
So me, Aiden, and Nicholas,
we drove them out far...
gave them a day's worth
of food and water
and left them.
They just went?
We had their guns.
We had all the guns.
I can't make
that kind of mistake again.
Wake up.
It's good what happened
last night.
We have more cover now.
All of them think you've been
found out, that it's over.
Why didn't you want to tell
them we had more guns?
Michonne stopped you.
She knocked you out.
Well, I deserved it.
Well, it was stupid.
She's with us.
Glenn is.
I didn't tell them
about the guns just in case.
I don't want to lie anymore.
You said you don't want
to take this place.
And you don't want to lie?
Oh, sunshine,
you don't get both.
Aaron:
Daryl:
Son of a bitch knows about how
to keep mosquitos off of him.
Come on.
Hey, Tobin.
Hey, Rick.
- You met with her?
-
So what is it?
It's what we thought.
I'm gonna talk to people.
I'll talk to everyone
I can right up until.
I'm gonna try to solve this.
What?
What?
I love you.
We're gonna work it out.
I know it.
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.
Sure you don't want
a gun, Father?
I just want a quick walk.
The word of God is the
only protection I need.
Carl:
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry.
I heard about the meeting.
You're staying home.
That's what it is now, right?
Home?
Yeah.
They need us.
They'll die without us.
I might have to threaten
one of them.
I could have
to kill one of them.
- You won't.
- I might.
You have to tell them.
I told them last night.
You have to tell them
so they can hear you.
I don't know if they can.
Does that make you afraid?
Just for them.
You have to tell them.
We checked the forest,
we checked the roads.
We can't find him.
Sometimes they slip away.
It happens.
But...
you don't come across something
like this every day.
We do this now,
it means we're giving up.
Home is 50 miles back.
It's time to go.
You saw it last night.
There's bad people out here.
That's why we ought to keep
looking for the good ones.
We need more people
and we'll find them.
But when we do,
we'll need to feed them.
All right.
Huh.
Whoa.
Wasn't sure I'd ever
see one of these.
Hey, listen, I don't
like giving up either,
but the guy is in a red poncho.
You can see him
from a mile away.
We've gone a lot of miles here.
No sign of him.
But...
if we come away with
a trailer full of cans,
I'd say that's a good trip.
Here we go.
Over here!
Daryl:
Come on!
- No!
- Come on.
Come on!
Go!
Glass will hold
for a while, right?
Maybe.
Maybe we can make it
so they can't see us.
In a couple hours,
something will come by,
they'll follow it out.
There's got to be something in
here we can use to block the view.
We can cut up these seats.
What the hell are you doing?
You need to check on Tara.
You treated her. You're a surgeon.
You need to do that.
Get out.
I could kill you right now.
I could.
I will.
And then who would
believe I did it
because I didn't like you?
No one.
They'd believe
you tried to hurt me.
Definitely believe that.
Come at me.
No.
The way this has played out,
you have a chance.
You're here.
Your wife's there.
You're a small, weak nothing.
And with the world how it is,
you're even weaker.
Play your cards right,
maybe you don't have to die.
And I want my dish back
clean when you're done.
Pete:
You should go.
I just wanted to check on you.
Your eye.
He did it right when
it was happening.
It wasn't you.
People shouldn't see us
talking right now.
I'm not sorry I did it.
No matter what happens
or what I have to do.
Don't turn around, Rick.
You were right.
What?
I came out here to...
not feel all closed up
back there.
Even now,
this still feels more like me...
than back in them houses.
That's pretty messed up, huh?
You were trying.
I had to.
No, you didn't.
Listen, I saw you with your
group out there on the road.
Then you went off
on your own by the barn.
Storm hit
That was it.
I knew I had to bring
you people back.
We should have kept looking
for that guy in the poncho.
I shouldn't have given up.
You didn't.
I'll go.
I'll lead them out.
You make a break for the fence.
No, no, no.
This was my fault.
It wasn't a question.
And this ain't your decision.
It ain't nobody's fault.
Just let me finish
my smoke first.
No. You don't
draw them away.
We fight.
We go for the fence.
We do it together.
All right?
Whether we make it or not,
we do it together.
We have to.
All right.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
We'll go on three.
One, two--
Come on.
Come on, get in here.
That was--
oh--
thank you.
I'm Aaron, this is Daryl.
Morgan.
Why?
Why?
Because all life
is precious, Daryl.
Whoever set that trap,
they're coming.
But I have good news.
We do.
We have a community
not too far from here.
I thank you.
But I'm on my way somewhere.
Fact is, I'm lost, so...
if you could tell me
where we are.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Oh.
I'll come by later.
He's asleep.
He's asleep.
Sit.
Whoops.
Good afternoon.
Eugene:
She also cracked open my gourd
to considering
implications I hadn't.
I will remark about
those at this time.
You got us here.
All I did was craft
a top-shelf lie
to which a person with strength and
heroism could apply their talents.
My bet was you needed that.
I thank you.
I am sorry.
And I mean both emphatically
and in equal measure.
I'm...
sorry, too.
Utterly and completely
unnecessary.
I almost killed you.
Yes, there's that.
You're back.
Good, just wanted
to sneak off to the meeting.
You think we could find
some time to talk later?
About Aiden?
Just some things I need to say
and I'm not sure
who I can say them to.
I don't really have
anyone here right now,
if you know what I mean.
I'll see.
Cool.
Can you get that?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
-
-
Rick.
You ready?
Carol, Daryl,
and me...
we worked it out together.
Carol took three guns
from the armory.
I still have one,
she still has one.
We lied to you because I
wasn't sure how you'd take it,
what you'd do.
You think I'd try to stop you?
Well, you did hit me
over the head.
That was for you, not them.
I was afraid you'd
talk me out of it.
You could've.
We don't need them here.
I don't need my sword.
I think you can find a way.
We can find a way.
And if we don't...
I'm still with you.
Something's gonna happen.
Just don't make
something happen.
Don't be too long.
Bob's voice: You're gonna
find yourself in a place
Rick's voice:
Bob's voice:
I came here...
because I don't--
I don't know what to do.
I'm losing my head.
Can you help me?
No.
We're going to start.
Can we wait?
There's still people coming.
Glenn, Rick.
We're going to start.
It's already dark.
We're going to talk
about what happened.
Not the fight.
Not what precipitated it.
We're dealing with that.
We're going to talk about
one of our constables,
Rick Grimes.
We're going to talk about how he had
a pistol he stole from the armory,
about how he pointed it at people.
I was hoping he'd be here.
She said he's coming.
I'm sure he'll be here.
And I'm sure we can
work this all out.
I think I want to die.
Why wouldn't you want to die?
You don't deserve to be here.
What you did
can never be undone.
The dead don't choose,
but the choices you made,
how you sacrificed
your own--
I know what you're doing.
Bob was mutilated.
Consumed.
Destroyed because of your sins.
Stop it.
Your brother felt
he was apart from it.
He was a part of it.
He didn't deserve to be here.
- You don't!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
And after being out there
and then not being
how you were out there...
it can drive you crazy.
He wants all of you
to live.
Who he is
is who you're gonna be...
if you're lucky.
Rick Grimes saved my life
over and over.
There's terrifying people out there.
And he rescued me from them.
People like me,
people like us
need people like him.
I know what happened
last night was scary.
And I'm sure
he's sorry for that.
But maybe we should listen
to what he was saying.
Simply put,
there is a vast ocean of shit
you people
don't know shit about.
Rick knows every
fine grain of said shit...
and then some.
- Please don't.
- Shh...
- No.
- They'll hear you.
It'll take longer to reset it.
Just be still.
Just be still.
Welcome home.
My father respected Rick Grimes.
Rick is a father, too.
He's a man with a good heart
who feels the things he does,
the things he has to do.
no matter when we found
Rick started that.
And you won't stop it.
You can't.
And you don't want to.
This community, you people...
you want to be
a part of it, too.
Before we hear
from anyone else, I--
I would like to share something
in the spirit of transparency.
Father Gabriel came to see me
the day before yesterday
and he said our new arrivals
can't be trusted,
that they were dangerous,
that they would put themselves
before this community.
And not one day later,
Rick seemed to demonstrate
all the things
Father Gabriel said.
I had hoped Gabriel
would be here tonight.
I don't see him here, Deanna.
So you're just saying
what someone said.
Did you tape him?
- He's not here.
- Neither is Rick.
Excuse me.
Noah died because of you.
And I tried to tell you
how it is, how it has to be
and you try to kill me?
I just want to keep
my family safe.
You know? And I don't even
know what that means anymore,
but if it means that
we've got to get rid of--
I was scared.
I was scared.
- I don't belong out here.
- Shut up.
I was scared.
I was just scared.
- Shut up.
- I don't--
- I don't belong--
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Gabriel:
Sasha.
You should let her.
They died.
They all died because of me.
They did.
There wasn't a guard
on the gate.
It was open.
I asked Gabriel to close it.
Go.
I didn't bring it in.
It got inside on its own.
They always will--
the dead and the living,
because we're in here.
And the ones out there...
They'll try to kill us.
We'll survive.
I'll show you how.
You know,
I was thinking--
I was thinking how many
of you do I have to kill
to save your lives?
But I'm not gonna do that.
You're gonna change.
I'm not sorry for what
I said last night.
I'm sorry for not
saying it sooner.
You're not ready,
but you have to be.
Right now, you have to be.
Luck runs out.
You're not one of us.
You're not one of us!
Pete, you don't want to do this.
- Get the hell away from me, Reg.
- Pete, just stop.
-
Not now.
- Get away. Get away!
- Now, Pete, stop. Pete--
- No, no! Oh, no, no!
-
- This is him!
- Shut up!
- This is him!
-
Oh, my love.
My love, my love.
No, my love, no.
No, my love.
Pete:
This is him!
Rick...
...do it.

Morgan:
