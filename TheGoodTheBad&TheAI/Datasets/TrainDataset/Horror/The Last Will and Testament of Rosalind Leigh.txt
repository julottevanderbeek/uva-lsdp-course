Woman:
Man: Our father
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Man:
Bill, it's Leon.
Give me a call.
Woman:
I spent the entire week
preparing for this,
and I walk in,
and it's all right here.
Bill:
And you didn't think
that I'd find that interesting?
You don't think
it's a little weird
that somebody is only
interested in items
from my personal
collection?
Yeah.
-
- Yeah.
It's been a while.
Okay. Yeah.
Um... thanks, bill.
Yeah.
Bye.
Woman: Come back here.
-
-
Hi.
Man: Hello.
I'm from next door.
I was a good friend
of your mother.
Oh, hi,
I'm Leon.
I know
who you are.
She spoke about
you often.
We're very saddened
by what happened.
We mourned her long,
and miss her deeply.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
May I come in?
Now's not really
a great time, but...
Perhaps later then?
Yeah.
We are a close
community here.
We've had many
special moments
in this old house.
It is
truly blessed.
Do you believe
in angels, Leon?
Your mother
believed in them deeply,
as do we.
Perhaps you will join us
once you're settled in.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks for stopping by.
One more thing.
There's an animal
that's come out
of the woods.
It's probably sick,
so it might
be dangerous.
You should
be careful.
Okay, I will.
The woods
belong to God,
but every so often,
something bad
comes out of them.
Okay, I'll keep
that in mind.
Bye, Leon.
God bless you.
Yeah.
Anna.
Hey. Uh, not much.
How are you?
Yeah. Uh...
Yeah. I, uh...
I... I can't
remember why I called.
Um...
Okay, no, no, no.
It's just, um...
I'm at
my mom's place now.
Yeah, it's...
I had no idea.
- Um...
-
Something happened that
I can't really explain.
Um...
You know, I was
just around and settling in,
and, uh, I left
the room for a second,
I came back,
and there's this statue
on the TV when
I didn't put it there.
In fact, I distinctly remember
seeing it in the basement.
- I'm positive.
How am I feeling?
Uh...
I wanna know why
that statue's on the TV.
Tu... what?
- Yeah.
-
Yeah, yeah.
It wasn't...
It was more of a test.
Could've said yes.
What?
Said the angel would
turn its back and...
Stop protecting me.
Well, you cleared
it up for me.
Yeah, yeah.
You still talk
like a doctor.
Night, doctor.
Man:
Woman: Leon.
-
-
-
Man:
Mother:
Woman:
Leon.
Hello.
Hello! Anybody there?
Woman:
I just had a disturbance
a few minutes ago.
I think, um, someone
may have been trying
to break in my house.
Uh, no, no.
It's okay now.
Yeah, that's right.
-
- Yeah, that'd be fine.
- Please hold.
- Thank you.
Woman:
grey childhood.
Man:
-
- Yes.
-
- Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
L-e-o-n.
-
- Yes.
Yes.
What is that moving?
What kind of animal?
hello?
Hello.
Fuck.
All right.
-
-
Um... there's something
happening.
There's... there's
somebody in the house.
-
- I don't know. I just...
No, no, no.
It's, um...
It's not that kind
of somebody.
-
- Yeah.
- What?
Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, no...
-
- Yeah.
-
-
-
-
-
- Yeah.
-
- Yeah.
-
Yeah.
-
-
Yeah.
Okay.
No.
Yeah, good night.
Thank you.
Mother:
No.
-
- No!
No.
I don't believe it.
Bill, it's Leon.
I wanna sell everything.
I want it all gone.
I'll send you
a full inventory
in a couple of days.
Okay? Thanks.
Sorry for waking you up.
