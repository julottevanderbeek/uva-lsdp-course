Mom! Mom!
Somebody help us!
COMPUTER'S VOICE:
Talk to me.
KYLE:
Hey, dirtbag.
Man, listen up!
"Brainscan.
The ultimate experience
in interactive terror.
"Brainscan is not
for the squeamish."
Well, Kyle, what's
the problem, man?
KYLE:
Brainscan.
"Satisfy your
sickest fantasies."
It's just an ad, birdbrain.
Just hype.
Remember "Gore Beasts"?
Trash.
Fangoria.
"We dare you
to participate
"in the most
frightening experience
available on this planet.
It's interactive, dude.
You're in the game, man.
You're in control.
Fangoria?
KYLE:
What do you mean?
You watchin' her again?
Can you see her...
Talk to me, man.
You better make your move soon
'cause I hear some no-neck
jock is about to make his.
I'll get around to it.
-Thanks, Kyle. Bye, Kyle.
Buddies, forever?
Buddies, forever.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Later.
Michael,
you're one sick puppy.
-Igor.
-
Dial Kimberly.
Later.
Igor, dial 1-800-555-FEAR.

-MAN'S VOICE:
Uh, my name is Michael Brower.
You can reach me at 717...
MAN:
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a machine.
MAN:
I read your ad in Fango.
What's the big deal?
Sure it is. Look,
I've played 'em all.
-Yeah, right, well...
- What's it about?
Look, R2-D2, how do you really
expect me to believe...
MAN:
Igor. Redial.
Oh, man!
This is really
disappointing, Kyle.
Dude, man,
it's not that bad.
When does he
eat her gallbladder?
It's right now.
Ew.
Look, she's freakin' out!
What exactly was that,
Mr. Brower?
A gallbladder, sir.
My office. Now.
The gallbladder.
PRINCIPAL: The activities
period was created for
intellectual enrichment.
Which is why
I have such a problem
with this Horror Club
of yours.
What was that film
you were watching?
"Death, Death, Death."
""Death, Death, Death."
Oh, Lord!
"Part Two."
Don't you see? Senseless
violence is not entertainment?
What is it, then?
Why?
Why do you watch these films?
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.
Help me understand.
I guess it's kind of
an escape.
Like, uh...
Like lighting up a marijuana
cigarette and escaping
the real world, hmm?
Like watching a pornographic
sex film,
getting an erection and
raping someone?
Is that what you mean?
You know, I don't think
erections rape people.
People rape people.
Consider the Horror Club
banned.
Banned!
Hey!
You will bring me
the next videotape
or video game you
plan to show.
I will watch it.
If I can stand it,
and if I approve,
you will be
allowed to show it.
Until that time,
the club is canceled.
Don't let me detain you,
Mr. Brower.
MAN:
You live around here, kid?
I live... I live
about three blocks down.
-These people
friends of yours?
-No, sir.
Well this is none
of your business then, is it?
Go home. Do your homework.
Go home.
My father.
My father.
My father.
I didn't order this.
-Okay, I guess.
Don't ask.
Igor, dial
And, Igor, no calls.
-
-IGOR:
Kimmy? Come on.
What are you doing?
I'll be right there.
Well, hurry up.
MAN:
Who the hell are you?
MAN:
No kidding!
-Like a video game, right?
Wait a minute.
Well, let's party.
VOICE FROM BRAINSCAN:
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
VOICE FROM BRAINSCAN:
Oh, my God!
Oh, man!
Oh, man!
Oh, that was...
That was intense!
That was insane.
Far out!
Oh, man!
I kicked butt
with time to spare.
All right. Try that.
How 'bout that?
Huh? How 'bout that?
MICHAEL:
It was so real!
KYLE:
But, man, what happened?
What's the plot?
Just forget the plot, man.
I don't remember any story.
There was all this blood.
And, you know, like,
my hands were shaking, too.
It was sick!
See, I told you
it would blow your mind.
Yeah, man, Kyle,
you were right.
-The feeling...
I loved it, man!
-So, you got it on you?
-Patience, Kyle.
-No, man, if it's
as good as you say...
I just want to play it
a couple of more times,
then I promise,
you'll get it.
-Hey!
-What the hell
were their problems?
Jerks!
Buddies forever?
Forever.
Igor.
Dial l-800-555-FEAR.
What the hell?
Shoot!
Hey, Mr. Keller. Can I come in
and speak with Kimberly
for a moment, please?
All right, thanks.
Come in.
MR. KELLER:
Kim, somebody to see you.
Hi.
-He came to see Kim.
-MRS. KELLER:
Oh, really?
-
-REPORTER:
-Poor man.
-So it happened
near here.
Jeez.
-Oh, my God!
Did you say something?
Listen, uh...
Can you tell Kim
that I'll stop by later?
I have to go.
Sorry.
REPORTER:
Can't be.
Can't be.
REPORTER:
POLICEMAN:
Hey, kid.
You following me?
I... Listen, I can explain.
Explain what?
You don't have to
explain anything.
Or do you?
You're inside a police line.
Now this is the second
time I'm telling you,
go home.
Go.
VOICE FROM BRAINSCAN:
OPERATOR:
-
That's impossible!
VOICE FROM BRAINSCAN:
You sucker! Who are you?
What did you do?
Okay, who killed that man,
and what's happened?
Please allow me
to introduce myself.
My name is Trickster.
Where were we?
Ah, yes.
You may not
remember the details, my boy,
but I am positive you remember
you controlled the disk.
-You controlled
what happened.
-What?
So you take responsibility.
How did you get
in here?
You invited me in.
That's how
it always works.
Michael, don't you
have anything good?
Never leave home
without it.
From the top
of the charts...
To a space
in your heart.
MICHAEL:
Stop that! Stop it!
Knock it off!
So you did it.
Who killed that man?
What was on that disk?
The murder.
What else?
You know for a minute there,
I didn't think
you'd go through with it.
When he got up
and started dancing
around the room...
Classic.
How do you know?
I was there
when you cut off his foot.
It was art. It was magic.
It wasn't
supposed to be real!
Real. Unreal.
What's the difference? So long
as you don't get caught.
There's a difference, okay?
There's a big difference!
This doesn't make any sense!
It doesn't have to make sense.
All these horror movies
you watch...
Does "Death, Death, Death"
make sense?
No. It's not about sense.
It's about death, death,
death.
I didn't kill the man.
I didn't even know him!
There lies the beauty.
You had no motive.
It was totally random.
Like in the animal world,
prey never has a name.
It was primal.
I can't wait to see
what you do next.
Next? Wait a minute!
There is no next.
Yes, there is.
No, there's not!
Yes, there is!
You must
eliminate the witness.
There was a witness?
Two, if you count me.
But I'll never
turn you in.
They could
pump a million volts
through me.
They could bust my fingers,
one by one,
by one,
by one.
They could dig out my eyes...
But...
No country-western music,
please. Every man
has his limits.
I thought it was just a game.
You know, a stupid video game.
Trust me.
Play the second disk.
-How could there
be a witness?
-Oh, come on, sport.
You're more than just the
voyeur you wish to be,
you're in this now.
You won't survive on your own.
I'm willing to help you.
But you have to play
all the disks.
Hey, I've done
pretty good so far.
Have you?
I'm in deep stuff.
Oh, God.
Here, boy,
come on.
-
-Here, boy,
come on.
Come on.
Hey, wait a minute!
Shoot!
Hey. Hey.
I know you're a nice dog.
Please, please
give me the foot.
Okay?
I promise, I'll never ask you
for anything else again. Okay?
Just give me the foot.
Thanks!
What do you got there?
What are you looking at?
Come on, Zak.
Get outta here.
KYLE: Hey, dude.
Hey!
Yo, Michael.
Hey, dirtbag,
I've been callin' all day.
Did you skip school?
Uh, no, I...
I got mono.
That's harsh.
Anything I can do?
Nah, that's all right.
Can I come in?
Kyle, I don't think
it's such a good idea
right now.
Okay, okay.
Listen, I have to get goin'.
I have to go to bed
and all, you know...
-Hey, did ya hear
about the murder?
-Yeah, I did.
Yeah, that's pretty cool
havin' a murder in our own
neighborhood and everything.
Kyle, a guy just died,
and you think that's cool?
No, I don't mean cool,
but it's interesting.
Forget it!
I'll see you.
Hey, listen Michael, if you're
gonna be laid up, how 'bout
letting me borrow Brainscan?
Kyle, idiot, will you
get off my back about that?
No, no. If you don't wanna
let me see it,
if you just want
to be a jerk about it,
-just say so,
that's all!
-Bye, Kyle.
You, too.
Jeez!
Hey.
Hi, Michael.
I'm sorry,
were you sleeping?
Well, actually, maybe
I may have dozed off.
Can I come in?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
KIMBERLY: Yeah, they're
all over the neighborhood.
I, uh, went to all your
teachers, and I got your
homework for the week.
Oh, thanks.
My parents said
you stopped by?
Yeah, I did.
I just wanted to find out
about some homework.
We don't have
any classes together,
Michael.
Oh, we don't, do we?
Oh, here's your mail.
Oh, thanks.
And I brought
I have a lot of pictures
in it this week.
Oh.
That's, uh...
That's really nice.
Uh...
Damn! Wait a minute.
Sorry, I got it, I got it.
Thanks a lot.
Is everything okay?
You should
probably get going.
Oh, okay... I'll, um...
Let myself out.
Thanks for stoppin' by.
Call me if you need anything.
Yeah, I will.
Jeez!
IGOR:
Talk to me.
I'm back.
Well, pal, so glad
to see you again.
-Where should we begin?
Where's the second disk?
-I can't play it.
You have to play the game.
No!
-What will you say
to them, then?
-What do you mean?
Why did you leave school
the day of the murder,
Mr. Brower?
Where were you
the night of the murder?
Were you alone, Mr. Brower?
Where's your father,
Mr. Brower? Where's
your mother, Mr. Brower?
Shut up!
Oh, I don't believe
they'll find that answer
satisfactory.
-They haven't found me yet!
-The witness has yet to
speak.
-There's still time
to play the second disk.
-Look!
I don't have the
second disk!
Don't lie to me, Michael.
You received it today.
-Can't play it!
-You mean you don't
want to play it.
No! I trashed it.
Does that compute?
-Pure fantasy.
You did nothing of the sort.
-
Play it.
The witness has to die.
I'll play it
for the police.
That could be
very dangerous.
I'll tell them what happened.
I've got nothing to lose.
Very well,
play it for the police.
I wish you luck.
Shut up, all right!
Just shut up a minute!
The real question is
are you a winner or a loser?
Oh, jeez!
Oh, God, I played.
I played.
What happened?
MICHAEL:
What? What?
Wait a minute!
I sat there!
I swear to God
I didn't leave.
Kyle!
No!
Not this.
Dial Kyle!
Please answer!
Kyle, please,
Kyle, answer!
MICHAEL:
Kyle, please!
POLICEMAN:
Who is this?
Answer me.
Later.
Hi.
I heard.
Michael.
I really didn't know him,
but, um,
Kyle came to my house
last night.
He brought me this.
He started a petition
to restart the Horror Club.
He said you guys had had
a fight, and he wanted me
to bring it to you personally.
I really didn't know him.
My dad didn't wanna let him
in the house.
Yeah.
That's Kyle.
You know...
I already miss him.
-God, I miss him.
-REPORTER:
ON-SCENE REPORTER:
Hello, Michael.
You son of a gun,
you killed Kyle!
No, you killed the witness.
Kyle wasn't a witness!
He didn't even see anything.
Not a witness
in the strictest sense,
but he knew things
about you.
Kyle was
my only friend!
And you ticked him off!
Nice going, Michael.
Got anything to eat?
Please.
Don't look in there.
Don't be afraid, Michael.
Nothing in there
but frozen meat.
Loose ends like Kyle
can't be left to dangle.
-Hayden would have tied it
around your neck like a noose.
-Why are you doing this?
You chose me, Michael.
I didn't choose you.
You left a clue behind...
In the second disk.
No more games.
I know.
Kyle's death still hurts,
but do you really feel guilty
for what you've done?
The part of you which did
these things,
It's deep inside,
and it's in everyone.
Be honest.
If you don't feel the guilt,
why accept the punishment?
Don't answer that.
Trust me, Michael.
If you want this to end,
don't answer the door.
Get off my back.
LARRY: A tarantula!
CURLEY:
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
Hello. I'm Lieutenant Hayden.
This is my partner,
Sergeant Martin.
We've met before.
Twice, I believe.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Um, can I help you?
Yes, you can help me.
Michael? Michael Brower?
Yeah.
May we come in?
Yeah, I guess so.
Um, yeah, come this way.
You haven't been
in school lately.
No, I haven't.
I've been sick.
Sorry to hear that.
I really am.
We heard a lot
about you today
from your classmates.
Really? Well,
I hope good stuff.
Well, no.
To be perfectly frank,
Michael,
you were described as, uh...
What was the word they used,
Sergeant?
-Frightening.
-HAYDEN: Frightening
and strange and weird.
Freak came up
a couple a times.
Sergeant Martin has something
I'd like you to see.
MARTIN:
Good friend of yours?
Yeah.
Yeah, he was
my best friend.
You don't have many friends,
do you, Michael?
Listen,
is there anything
you guys want?
We want to find the killer.
I want to catch him.
How do you spend
your free time, Michael?
Just hanging around
and staying out of trouble.
Your voice sounds
very familiar to me.
-Are you sure you didn't call
Kyle's house after the murder?
-No, no, that wasn't me.
Of course it wasn't.
But, Michael,
if you are anything
but the class misfit,
which I know must give you
a lot of pain,
I'm gonna find out
about it, you understand?
Take it easy.
He's a very sad boy.
Maybe, but somethin's there.
Yeah, ashes.
And he made the phone call.
Check with
the phone company.
All right.
What's with the ashes?
There were fresh ashes
in the fireplace.
It's summer.
He was burning something.
-I think we just got
very lucky.
-Maybe.
-What the hell you doin'?
-I'm sick of you doin'
Gimme the keys.
Slob.
Hi, Mike.
Fixed myself a little snack.
Hope you don't mind.
They think it's me.
Of course they do.
Right now
Hayden only suspects you.
How long you think it's
gonna be
before he has proof, huh?
A few hours?
Few minutes, maybe.
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
hey, Mike?
You see today's paper?
"Special edition."
Ooh!
"Interview with best friend."
"All of Mountview High
was in a state of shock."
So on, so on, so on.
"One student's loss
was greater..."
Mmm?
"'I miss him. God.
"'I miss him already,'
sobbed his best friend
"and president
of the still-banned
"Horror Club."
How could she?
Trust me, Michael.
I only want what you want.
Buddies forever?
Damn you!
Hold still!
Scared of blood?
Remind you of something?
That road? The rain?
Your mother?
Let go of me.
Play it, Michael.
Or forget all this.
Join your mother.
Take your own life.
You've thought of it
many times before.
You could be with her forever.
You started this, and
now you're afraid to
finish it,
just like you're afraid
of everything else!
Of Kimberly, of Fromberg,
of telling your father
how sick you are of being
left alone all the time.
Of your mother,
who abandoned you.
I'm trying to help you!
But you won't let me.
How?
A bargain,
between friends.
Play "Part Three,"
but you only need to remove
the clue.
No killing.
There's no clue.
It's just a trick.
You just don't trust me.
-
-Wait a minute!
Come back! Hold on.
How am I supposed to know
what the clue is?
Friends?
Yeah.
Sure. Friends.
-Buddies.
Whatever you want.
-Footprint.
What?
Footprints in the mud.
But where? That is the
question. Play it, Michael.
Otherwise you'll never
remember the location.
My limp.
Excellent!
There's no killing, right?
Whatever happens is up to you.
But don't let your
time run out.
If I do?
Game over. You lose.
Michael?
Michael, come on!
Michael!
Michael!
I need to talk to you.
We need to talk.
Michael,
I have to talk to you.
We need to talk.
Michael. I didn't mean
for this to happen.
Stacie did it.
Michael, I'm so sorry.
-I didn't mean...
-
HAYDEN: May I have your
attention, please?
Stay in pairs.
One walkie-talkie
to a group.
Hopefully this will be
an uneventful evening.
You're here
to keep things calm,
to protect.
That's what a neighborhood
watch is all about.
If you see anything unusual,
you come and report
directly to me.
One last thing.
I know you're volunteers.
I know you're enthusiastic.
Some more than others.
And I know some of you
own hunting rifles
and revolvers.
If I see a weapon
in a citizen's hands tonight,
I'm gonna confiscate
that weapon, and I'm gonna
arrest that citizen,
even if it's a water pistol.
Clear?
Okay, that's it.
Thank you for doing this.
All right.
Here goes nothin'.
Just a clue.
No more killing.
Just the clue.
Yeah.
TRICKSTER:
I believe there's
an intruder in your yard.
Who's this?
A concerned citizen.
Who is this?
Hey!
Here you go, man.
-
-MAN: That's it.
That's it. This way.
MAN: Over here.
More light.
-Shoot!
-
Ahhh!
Got you!
Lemme go!
Lemme go!
MAN: Hayden!
Hayden, where the hell are ya?
I got him here! Hayden!
Hayden.
What is it?
Hayden!
-Hayden, Hayden!
-Turn the knob on the top
of the radio, the small one.
Hayden, come in
for god's sake!
HAYDEN:
-MICHAEL: Oh, jeez.
-HAYDEN:
SEARCHER:
What was that?
Hey, you!
HAYDEN:
MAN: Over there!
SEARCHER: Let's go!
SEARCHER:
This way, come on!
Let's go. Hurry up!
Damn.
MAN: Hey, I need some light
over here. Right down there.
Oh, God.
Okay, I know I said I'd never
ask you for anything again,
but this time I really
mean it.
Just leave me alone, please?
Get outta here.
-MAN: Jeez.
-SEARCHER:
He's got a gun!
MARTIN:
Police officer.
What are ya doin', kid?
I was... I...
They just shot the killer
over there. Get outta here.
Which one of you would
like to tell his wife?
Michael?
What's going on?
Are... Are you okay?
Shoot!
What happened?
I killed somebody.
Again. I killed somebody.
But you said
I wouldn't kill anybody.
You promised!
Stop.
This isn't a game anymore.
This is crime. This is
just lots of crimes!
No.
Forensics says
you're gonna need this.
And the Brower kid
is the one
who placed the call.
What do you want from me?
That's it.
I'm gonna go to Hayden
right now
and turn myself in.
You wanted the ultimate
experience in terror.
Well, terror's in the doing.
It's not watching horror films
like some child.
And it's not spying on
Kimberly.
You get off on that, Michael.
I love her.
It could be any girl
in any window.
I won't kill her!
She'll tell!
She won't tell!
She'll come to me first!
Like last time?
Stop this!
Only you can stop this.
Her life or yours!
Choose.
Cut.
Michael?
KIMBERLY: Michael?
Michael,
are you home?
-Igor?
-
Dial Brainscan.
What are you waiting for?
Michael?
Kill her.
I can't.
Cut her up.
I'll do it myself.
Michael! You wouldn't
do this to me.
-Who the hell are you?
-I can't believe you
still don't know.
Michael.
I'm you.
No.
Ha-ha-ha!
Michael.
KIMBERLY: No!
Michael!
Oh! Michael.
My God.
Michael, I'm so scared.
Michael.
Please, you can't do this.
Michael,
Michael, please.
I don't care
what you've done.
I love you. Please.
You'd do anything
to save your life.
No, I love you.
Believe me.
I just kept it a secret.
I never told anybody.
But that's over now.
You watch me
from your window.
I know you do.
I've known for a long time.
I watch you too.
I bet you
didn't know that.
Look, I take pictures.
Look. That's you.
You, you.
I love you, Michael.
I knew you couldn't
do it on your own.
Game over.
You lose.
Perhaps.
But first...
Surprise.
Murderer.
No!
Murderer.
No!
No!
Oh, my God.
What... The freaking hell?
-What is this?
-
It was a... A dream.
-MICHAEL: A dream.
-It wasn't even real!
-All right.
MICHAEL:
I didn't kill anybody.
There's no Trickster.
Jerks!
Oh, man.
You put me through hell!
Why don't you try these
freaking relaxation
techniques?
KYLE: Michael!
Yo, dude. Hello?
Kyle!
Oh, my God, Kyle!
KYLE: Hello?
Aw!
Dirtbag! I have been
ringing your doorbell,
calling you for an hour.
There is a party next door!
Kyle!
-No, it's Axl Rose!
-God, man!
I missed you, man!
Careful, man!
You're gonna kill yourself
on my lucky charms, man.
They're magically delicious.
Ha-ha-ha!
It's good to see you, Kyle.
I missed you. I love you!
Dude, man, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, man.
Good. Listen, it's
a good thing you didn't order
that Brainscan tape, man.
I saw something on the news
about it. Like, it's hypnotic
or some stuff like that.
Some kid in Texas
was watching it, and I
think he had an aneurysm.
I think his eyes
exploded too.
Man, what is it?
-Kimberly. Come on, man.
-Go for it, man.
Let's go!
Kimberly?
Damn.
Stacie, do you know
where Kimberly is?
She's upstairs.
Upstairs?
Yeah.
With Taylor.
Stacie, for once,
don't be a witch.
Hey. Stacie, right?
Yeah.
That outfit's
totally bitchin'.
You think so?
I know so.
You look just like
that girl in that video by
what's-his-name. Only better.
Video? Really?
Totally.
You're Kyle, right?
Uh-huh.
Hi, Kyle.
Kimberly?
Michael.
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?
Yeah, c'mon.
Well, uh...
I just...
-I just wanted to ask
one thing.
-Okay.
Please, will you
go out with me?
I don't think so.
I mean,
I'll think about it.
I-I-It's not really
a good time to ask,
you know what I mean.
You'll think about it.
Yes. But...
Maybe. Right?
Not no.
Maybe.
Maybe yes.
Maybe.
So you mean, uh,
you and Taylor...
Are you kidding me?
Well, listen, um...
I have to...
Get back, so...
