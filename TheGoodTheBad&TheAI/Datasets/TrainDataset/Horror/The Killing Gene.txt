Detective Westcott,
Eddie Argo.
Eddie, be nice.
How's it goin'?
Have you eaten yet?
No. Couldn't eat.
Jack!
JACK: Ed, how you doin'?
What you got?
JACK: Couple of kids found her.
Burning, looks like.
JACK: Maybe she was electrocuted.
She's Sharon Williams,
Wesley Smith's girlfriend.
ED: Wes?
Well, maybe she's better off dead.
Who's Wesley Smith?
Pimp, gangster,
all-around piece of shit.
Wanna take a shot?
-
- Go ahead.
Phew... premeditated.
Obviously.
Uh, it was maybe sexual.
Dumping her could Just be panic.
Though why here
and not in the river?
Why not Just, uh,
chop her up in pieces
and stuff her in the Dumpster?
Looks like "was."
Or "Wes."
JACK: Either way,
somebody don't like Wesley.
Maybe they Just don't like her.
Yeah.
You know, if you carve something
into the belly of a dead woman...
it ain't her you want to read it.
fucking gangbangers.
What if the child wasn't Wesley's?
Maybe he got Jealous.
Let's see if he's grieving.
There's Pierre Jackson's crew.
Driver's Danny Leone.
ED: That's Pierre,
local asshole number one.
JAMAL: Yo, yo, yo.
Pierre, what up, man?
ED: That's Hassan's gang,
the only competition
he's got left here.
There's Jamal Osman,
another of Pierre's assholes.
Can't see Wesley, though.
So a rival gang's
high on your list of suspects?
No.
These bastards
ain't the electrocuting kind.
They're more like,
"fucking hate you." Bang.
Well.
Bad guys.
Go question.
Hey.
We're looking for Wesley Smith.
Well, he sure as hell
ain't lookin' for you.
You new, baby?
-
- You look kind of fuckable for a cop.
Want some thug dick, woman?
- She wants it bad.
- Snow White's got it bad.
- You've seen Wesley?
- What you down on Wes for?
Yeah, what the fuck you want, bitch?
His girlfriend
was murdered last night.
- Electrocuted.
- fuck that.
What the fuck you talking about?
WESTCOTT:
Have you seen him, hmm?
What you think, Wes did it?
Why the fuck is he gonna off his girl
when she having his baby and shit?
You looking for a suspect,
maybe you need to take a look
at fucking Hassan over here.
Why the fuck would I waste my time
fizzin' a chickenhead skank
like that ho, huh?
What the fuck!
ED: Put it away.
MAN: Yo, Argo!
Snuffing a pregnant girl
would be right up your alley, Pierre.
Two helpless victims in one.
Night full of kicks.
Throw her in the bath...
maybe toss a heater in after her.
Come on, man, we were rolling
with her Just last night.
Uh-huh. What?
Selling shit to kids down
at your place in Denver Street?
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- PIERRE: Shut the fuck up, Jamal.
Also in Stenman Street, huh?
Thanks.
Yeah, come on, man.
- We're all going, yo.
- Yo, Pierre.
- Shut the fuck up.
- You into that?
fucking come on, man.
I'll bet you are.
You like a little black, huh?
Hey, don't you wanna
chomp down on this for me?
Hey, yo, bitch!
You should go for it.
You know, pillow talk.
Could be useful.
I was warned you're an asshole.
Think you did great.
Apart from nearly getting us killed.
GANGSTER:
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Want a blow Job?
I suck dick good for 10 bucks.
Elly, it's me.
Wesley around?
He went up there.
It might have been yesterday.
Shh.
ED: Hi, Dominic.
ELLY: It's okay, baby.
Ah, fuck.
JACK: To Wesley Smith,
a fucking asshole
who will not be missed.
MEN: Yeah!
CHIEF MacLEAN: Okay, cute.
Back to work.
I hope all that blood
don't give you nightmares.
I was even thinking
someone ought to,
you know,
take care of you tonight.
I'd rather be electrocuted.
No offense.
Oh, shit.
MAN: Yeah, we'll send someone round.
So you really think
he deserved to die?
Sure.
I wish I'd done it myself.
PATHOLOGIST: Nice party.
Postmortem incision.
Electrocution around the head.
WESTCOTT: Like an execution.
PATHOLOGIST: Internal organs,
brain, etcetera,
all cooked, of course,
at about 8:00 p.m. last night.
Now, they both have traces
of an extremely strong,
fast-acting sedative,
one that's normally used
to tranquilize animals.
Out in less than half a minute,
awake again in an hour.
ED: So that links them
to the same guy.
She was electrocuted...
and Wes here was tortured.
You think they were together
when she was electrocuted?
Did he hang himself
or was it made to look that way?
PATHOLOGIST:
Looks like suicide.
ED: What's this,
this burn on his fingers?
PATHOLOGIST:
Only thing that doesn't fit.
It's the only burn on him.
Could it be electrical,
like from a switch?
PATHOLOGIST: Could be.
You think he electrocuted
his pregnant girlfriend?
I don't know.
Maybe he didn't...
but he sure as hell
didn't slash the shit out of himself.
WESTCOTT: Is your apartment
this much of a mess?
ED: Much worse.
Needs a woman's touch.
WESTCOTT:
Yeah. In your dreams.
ED: How 'bout you?
Live alone?
You got a boyfriend
to keep you warm?
Alone.
Ouch.
And you'll never forgive him, right?
Whatever.
Just here.
ED: You must be in some racket
to be able to afford this.
Turning tricks?
See you tomorrow.
See you.
You got five bucks?
What I look like, a millionaire?
ED: Did Wes have any new enemies
you haven't told me about?
Pierre and Jamal
still think it was Hassan's crew.
This was no stupid ghetto drive-by.
This was psychological, sadistic.
That's always your problem, Eddie.
You underestimate people, man.
I mean, shit, if Pierre knew
I was rolling with you,
you'd see some fucking sadism.
Did I tell you
even his dick got sliced?
Is this real grief...
or you Just scared the guy sliced Wes
won't like you too much either?
He got what was
coming to him, Danny.
Crazy-ass bitch from next door.
Always wanting back
for something, man.
Who there?
-
- What the fuck?
Yo, Jamal!
Come on, man!
Hey, yo, shit!
Come on, Jamal.
Shit, come on, Jamal.
Jamal, come on, man.
Stay with me, bro.
Come on, man. Don't you...
Jamal, come on, man.
Come on. fuck.
Come on, wake up, man.
Yo, Jamal, come on, please.
Please! Shit.
f-fuck.
Yo, get a fucking ambulance, man.
DANNY: Get an ambulance.
- So you called the ambulance.
-
JACK: Danny, you got something?
DANNY: This is all I got.
That's good.
See? It wasn't so hard.
Next time I ask you for something...
MAN: Over here, sir.
Is that the fucking brother?
JACK: We got two vics in each case,
Wesley Smith and Jamal Osman,
both tortured half to death.
Wes hangs himself;
Jamal dies later.
Then Wes's girl and Jamal's twin brother,
both of them electrocuted,
and the twin brother tagged
with more of this gang shit.
ED: Both Wes and Jamal
had a burned index finger.
What if they were forced?
What if they were tortured
till they had to flick the switch?
And the switch burned them.
It's some kind of punishment.
JACK: It's working itself up
into a nice little fucking gang war.
- Goddamn scum.
- WESTCOTT: This is algebra.
Look, an equals sign.
Z equals."
JACK: Thank you very much,
Professor Westcott.
Now maybe you could tell me
what it fucking means.
WESTCOTT:
It means it's not the gangs,
unless they're attending
fucking night school.
What?
Great. Thank you.
Hey, Eddie.
The animal tranq's
marketed as Alstyxamine,
and only one place
buys it in the whole state.
Got the address.
Dr. Gelb?
Dr. Gelb.
The animals are licensed.
All the certificates are up to date.
WESTCOTT: This lab is
the only place within 100 miles
to keep stocks of Alstyxamine.
Would you tell us
what you use it for?
It's all legal,
Just the way you guys like it.
Listen, if you want me
to take you in for being an asshole,
I got a license to do that.
What animals would you use it on?
I used to keep
a couple of crocs. That's all.
Are you aware of any Alstyxamine
going missing in the last three months?
No.
Who else has access
to your stocks of tranquilizer?
Nobody.
Any lab assistants?
Money's tight.
What kind of science do you do?
Pathology, animal behav...
I'm gonna need this opened, please.
Uh, yeah. Sure.
There you go.
This is quite a collection
of drugs you got here.
Gonna need to see your records.
ED: What do you do exactly?
Graft elephant ears on monkeys?
My work concerns
how species respond to predators,
how they warn each other,
if they warn each other...
how far they go to protect each other,
if they protect each other.
Like, you throw a croc
into a cage of monkeys
and see how they deal with it?
Not always with a real crocodile.
You see, monkeys are expensive.
Eddie?
fuck.
Shit, Eddie!
Eddie!
Shit.
fuck.
Unh-unh!
Don't move!
Don't fight.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Hmph!
Explain it to me.
what does it mean?
The Price equation.
The...  fitness,
the ability to reproduce
across generations.
Z is a particular trait. Delta...
ED: Less technical.
I don't understand.
Humor us.
The selfish gene.
WESTCOTT: Go on.
Um...
you think a bird
will sacrifice itself for the flock,
or a bee will sting a predator
and die for the hive?
How noble.
How heroic.
- WESTCOTT: And it isn't true?
- DR. GELB: No, it isn't true.
Of course, you... you put
a snake into the cage
and one of the monkeys is a hero...
lures it away, lets it eat him.
But it's not heroism.
It's not selflessness.
forget the bees.
forget the monkey.
fuck the monkey.
The monkey's nothing.
Just think what
the monkey's made of.
WESTCOTT: What's that?
Genes.
The monkey is Just the gene's way
of making copies of itself.
All these monkeys,
they're all related.
They all share their genes.
So the monkey dies.
What do the genes care?
That's what Price proved.
There's no altruism in nature.
It's Just genes
looking after themselves.
How many dead monkeys so far?
Do you mind not smoking
in here, please?
Just imagine a hero
without a genetic motive,
not a relative,
not a potential mate.
Now, that would be
interesting, wouldn't it?
When did you graduate to people?
What do you mean?
Why'd you run?
Ketamine.
I thought that's why...
I've been dealing Ketamine.
Just a bunch of college kids.
If you want,
I can give you their names.
I've been so low on funding,
I've Just had to improvise.
We have four dead bodies, Dr. Gelb,
knocked out with your animal tranq,
two of them with your equation
carved into their flesh.
I didn't kill anyone.
Somebody's carving the Price equation
into people's bodies? fuck.
fuck! fuck!
I swear I didn't kill anyone.
-
- He's got the animal tranqs.
He's got the theory,
which is a pretty freaky coincidence,
and he's nuts.
Well, the killer wants us
to work it out, right?
Why scratch your message
into the corpses?
- That's a tough code to crack.
-
We need help,
so he sends us to Dr. Gelb.
Gelb's had a message from God:
"Tell the world,
repent its selfishness or burn."
It's not Dr. Gelb.
Until last night, he was
at a conference at State University.
Whoever it is is running
an experiment like Dr. Gelb.
And this wack Job actually thinks
we're gonna learn fucking algebra.
It says love is bullshit;
deep down, it's Just genes, and
genes don't give a damn about love.
But human beings...
what's our love worth?
Our guy wants to know.
The mother of your children,
your twin brother...
how much pain will it take
before you kill someone you love?
So, I'm all wired up to Eddie, right?
I flip the switch. He's toast.
But before that he tortures you,
cuts you open,
cuts off your dick if he has to.
Love you, Eddie, but I am
gonna flick the fucking switch, man.
I don't think our guy is gonna stop
till he gets to the end of the equation.
I need a sandwich.
All I could think, man...
one day...
gots nobody.
Danny.
I think it's her.
I think it's Jean Lerner.
fucking Pierre, man.
Yo, what's up?
Oh, yeah?
Eddie. I gotta show you something.
Gelb's only had
three assistants in four years,
and one of them's on our database.
What for?
Victim in a rape and murder case.
Jean Lerner?
Yeah. It was my case.
Wesley Smith and Jamal Osman
were part of that gang, right?
Raped her and murdered her mother?
Those two plus Pierre Jackson,
Daniel Leone,
and a woman, Elly Carpenter?
ED: Elly Carpenter, the girl
with the kid in the crackhouse.
Taking on guys like that,
she'd have to be fucking Wonder Woman.
So, what happened, Eddie?
All of them walking free?
What the fuck happened
with forensics?
Contaminated.
All of it?
All of it.
But you did get a confession
from Jamal Osman.
Corelli beat the crap out of him to get it,
so it was useless.
Those assholes.
What they did to those women
you can't believe.
Eddie, we should get a warrant.
She's still living here.
She drew illustrations for...
for children's books.
She was living here
to take care of her...
take care of her mother.
Those bastards.
They didn't even steal a thing.
Nah, no point.
Just for kicks.
Cut her, snapped some fingers...
raped her with a bottle, broken bottle.
Tortured her for four hours,
and then they did her a deal.
They'd stop and leave her at peace
if she'd Just tell 'em
to shoot her mother.
Eddie, look at this.
Yeah?
WOMAN:
Jean?
Who's next, Jean?
Who you gonna test next?
Call Corelli.
Tell him to send patrol cars
to Elly Carpenter's,
and I want 24-hour uniforms
on Jackson and Leone
and the tapes from these cameras.
Yeah, I need forensics at 497...
Danny, it's me.
Where are you?
DANNY:
Go straight home.
Lock your door.
Don't open it to anybody but me.
I was right.
It's about the Lerner women.
- Who'd you call?
- What?
You called someone.
I warned Daniel Leone.
They don't all deserve to die.
Where's the fucking backup?!
-
- Elly?
I should call.
Can't a person sleep?
Is your little boy here?
He's in bed.
fuck is it to you?
Want to fuck me, is that it?
Tight-ass bitch.
Dominic is not in his bed.
Elly, where's Dominic?
- Where is he?
- He's sleeping.
- Elly!
- What?
He's not in there!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Oh... uh.
fuck, no.
He's still playing out in the hall.
You got a problem?
Huh?
Dominic!
Dominic!
Come on, baby.
Time to come up.
Shut up, Elly.
- The elevator.
- Yeah.
ELLY: Where are you going?
Dominic?
Come up, baby.
Dominic!
- Dominic!
- Elly!
ELLY: I'm coming!
Mommy's coming!
Elly, come back!
No!
Elly!
Dominic!
Elly!
Elly!
Mommy's coming!
Oh!
- Dominic!
- Shit.
Hold on, baby!
-
- ELLY: No!
What the fuck took you so long?
Where have you been?
This is Elly fucking Carpenter.
I ain't breaking my balls for her.
She's got a kid, you moron!
You know who Just
walked away with him?
Jean Lerner, Jack.
That's who the killer is.
Jean fucking Lerner.
Who'd you put watching
Pierre Jackson and Danny Leone?
What are you telling me,
they got kids too?
'Cause I don't think so.
If Jean Lerner wants to bleed
those fucking scum to death,
maybe I ain't gonna stop her.
Maybe me and you
owe it to her not to stop her.
Huh?
Just do your fucking Job, Jack.
What?
You got something to say to me,
fucking say it.
I'm Just confused, Eddie.
You don't seem to treat Daniel Leone
like a murderer and rapist.
So how do you want me
to treat him, huh?
He's the best informer I've got.
No, he's not a murderer;
he's not a rapist.
He wasn't even in that fucking house.
He was outside in the car.
He was Just a kid.
He ain't my friend, Helen...
but there are shades
of fucking gray.
GANGSTER: How many white?
- MAN: Catch you later.
- MAN #2: Later, Hassan, yo.
Now what crazy-ass, fucked-up shit
you gonna do now?
That motherfucker killed Wes.
- CLERK: Hey, Hassan.
- Yo, what's up?
I told you, it ain't Hassan.
It's fucking Jean Lerner!
- B.S.
- Straight up, man.
Think about it, man, think!
Hey, yo, Hassan!
Hassan!
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
You fucking crazy?
The fuck is wrong with you?
He killed Wes and Jamal.
Where's your fucking loyalty?
It was Jean Lerner!
fucking payback,
payback for what you done, Pierre.
for what  done.
- What  done, man!
- You're a fucking pussy!
What?
Hey, Grandma.
How you doing?
You know how to use the TV, right?
Yeah, use the, uh...
use the remote.
Yeah... the box with the numbers on it.
No, no, no, other... other box...
with numbers on it.
-
- I've been running.
That's right. I gotta go now.
I love you. Love you. Okay, bye.
Hey, Hassan, you piece of shit.
Danny, where you going?
Danny, come on, don't be like that.
- Yo, Danny!
- fuck you!
Don't be like this, you piece of shit.
fucking amateur!
CHIEF MacLEAN:
Any news on the truck?
WESTCOTT: It's impossible
to read the license number,
but we're checking every white
ford Econoline Van 150 from '91 to '94.
CHIEF MacLEAN: Do an APB,
run traces on everything...
credit cards, IRS.
We're gonna find this kid.
If Smith and Osman
failed some kind of test,
that three-nickel-a-blow-Job
chickenhead
sure as fuck ain't
gonna come through.
MAN: Oh, okay.
No, it's a white truck, sir.
That's right.
Yeah, anytime.
Can I talk with him, please?
Go on.
You know, she was
the only one of my assistants
who seemed to care about the work.
She made drawings for me.
You saw them.
The Price equation changed her life...
made sense of everything.
And then one day,
she... she didn't come in.
You know, I can see
the monkey in you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
-
- Daniel Leone's an informer.
I mean, he is an informer, right?
What's your point?
Cops use him as a dealer...
and for sure he's not the only one.
Cops do coke. I get that.
I wasn't born yesterday,
and I know shit happens,
but the Lerner case, sir,
it's hard to believe.
I mean, it was a fiasco.
Getting a confession
but covering the guy in bruises?
Of course it wasn't gonna fly.
And you think
they fucked it up for drugs?
Is that what you're saying?
No, I...
but maybe they're in too deep
and it's clouding their Judgment.
My priority, Detective,
is a missing kid.
If you want to make it your crusade
to clean up this precinct...
be my guest.
No one's gonna thank you, though.
Eddie.
What are you doing there?
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?
I Just figured I'd be safer here.
What happened?
It was fucking Pierre.
He killed Hassan, man.
She's got Elly, Elly and her kid.
fuck.
Took them from
right under my fucking nose.
What if you don't find her?
I'll book you.
There.
MAN: Sir, no parking here.
Police business.
Take it out of here.
Should've been you got fried.
Did you see who did this?
Was it a woman?
Was it... was it Jean Lerner?
It was me.
I killed him.
I killed my baby!
I killed my baby.
I killed him.
How did the case
get fucked up so bad?
Crime like that, must have
been a lot of DNA evidence.
None of it would stick?
JACK: Yeah, that's right. The bathroom
on the next floor, flooded lab.
Everything got wet, okay?
Kids busted up the crime scene
before we could re-collect.
- And the gun?
- Never found.
And what, you figured
if you beat a confession from Jamal
the D.A. would let it go?
Listen, you cunt.
If you'd seen what they did,
that fucking scum,
you might've lost it a bit too.
What the fuck.
Gotta talk to Danny Leone.
Right. I'll come with you.
No, you don't.
- This is not acceptable, Eddie!
- What?
Just because you got a history
doesn't make this your personal mission.
What do you mean, history?
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna persuade him to be bait.
He's trying to protect you, okay?
fuck you.
GUARD: Hey, Eddie?
- Man, did you find...
- Shut up!
Just shut up.
You were Just driving the car, right?
You were Just outside in the car.
What happened?
- You tortured that woman.
- I-I did not...
- You fucking raped her.
- I didn't rape her!
- You were in that fucking house.
- I didn't kill nobody, man.
What did you do to those women?
You were in there!
Man, I didn't lay a finger, a'ight?
I was Just in the hall.
You were in the hall?
I was Just in the hall, man.
You were in there?
Oh, Jesus!
Jesus!
And you weren't Just
in the fucking hall, were you?
Were you?
I...
I wasn't.
'Kay?
Eddie, I didn't do nothing, man.
I swear, I thought we Just gonna gank
some Jewelry and bust the fuck out.
Pierre was fucking out of control, man.
I couldn't stop him.
I couldn't do anything.
I didn't want no part of it, man.
Remember seeing Elly.
She was Just standing over her...
with a bottle...
covered in blood, man.
I couldn't fucking handle it.
I went and sat on the stairs
like a fucking pussy, a'ight?
You could've done something.
You could've called the fucking cops.
You had the gun, Danny.
You could've blown
Pierre's fucking brains out.
I was a kid.
I don't know nobody else.
Who was gonna have my back?
You?
I didn't lay a finger.
You know me, Eddie.
Yeah.
No, Danny isn't such a bad guy.
Pierre is the fucking devil.
Danny Just gets caught up
in things, right?
I should've done something.
You're Just a low-life
fucking dope whore.
What does that make me?
She'll be coming for you,
you know that.
She'll come for you...
and someone you care about.
Who do you love?
Is there anyone you love?
I'm gonna fucking kill you, bitch.
Bitch.
Bitch. You called me that before,
when you were cutting me.
Do you remember cutting me?
Yeah, and I remember how you
fucking screamed like a bitch.
In fact, my cock is getting hard
thinking about you right fucking now!
My mom used to say...
before we killed her...
You.
...that if they act like wild beasts
it's not their fault...
so deep down...
you're still the little boy
your grandmother loved.
WOMAN: Pierre?
Where is the little boy you loved?
It's okay, Grandma.
It's okay, all right.
S-so you take care
of your grandmother, right, Pierre?
I mean, you love her...
but I wonder how much.
Where you going?
Where you going? Where you going?
Aw...
If you want the pain to stop...
Aw, man.
...there's the switch.
Or you can lay down your life...
Oh, man, my fingers!
...if you love her enough.
But there will be pain.
I don't want...
Aah!
Sorry.
Hey, uh, I can be too quick to Judge.
It's a flaw in my character, I'm told.
Look, if you think Danny Leone's
not such a bad guy, what do I know?
He's the scum of the fucking earth.
Hey, Eddie.
Where's your grandma?
You killed her, right?
PIERRE: Oh, man.
Man, I did her a fucking favor, man.
Where did Jean Lerner take you?
What the fuck do you care?
I was fu... I was unconscious.
I don't know where we went.
Ain't no fucking cavalry gonna
Just ride in for me, Eddie.
Only person that's looking after me...
is me.
You would've done the same.
Anybody...
would have done the same.
She didn't cut you up
like Wesley and Jamal.
Come on.
fucking fuck!
Elly's the only one that got to me.
The others, it'd be a miracle
if they passed her test...
but I did think a mother
would do anything for her child.
Well, you never met mine, then.
You want kids?
No.
We talked about it.
With that guy
who walked out on you...
the one who thinks
you're a self-righteous bitch?
He didn't walk out on me.
I threw him out.
Yeah, I figured that out.
God, no one would pass
Jean Lerner's test.
How'd you get so bitter?
You spend seven years
with someone...
you think it counts for something.
Doesn't matter how many times
a guy says he loves you.
In the end, it doesn't mean a thing.
So, this guy hurt you.
I get it.
Well, maybe he loved you.
Now, that's something.
You gotta bleed
to know there's blood,
to know your heart is beating.
Someone will love you...
if you're lucky...
and when they do,
Just fucking grab it...
with both hands.
Let's go.
She won't try to take him
until it's dark.
Take an officer with you.
Just two guys?
We don't want to scare her off,
do we?
How's it hanging, Danny?
It's not my idea of a night out either,
fuckface, watching your ass.
Come on.
Hey!
Ah, fuck you.
- Yep?
- CLERK: Two-fifty.
JACK:
Was that Corelli? Eddie.
What's going on?
Come on, boy.
Shit.
What is this shit?
Danny, what the fuck
are you playing at? Call me.
Hey, hey, man!
You give me some help?
WOMAN: Don't listen to him, Marty.
Look right here.
Look into my face.
Oh. Shit.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Hey! Unh!
JEAN: You okay?
- MAN: Hey!
- JEAN: You all right?
You all right, man?
What happened?
He Just dropped.
He hit his head pretty hard.
It seems kind of serious.
I think we should get him to the hospital.
I should call an ambulance.
No, it could take an hour or more.
You know what,
I work at Mercy Hospital.
Why don't... why don't I Just
get him in my van, drop him off?
It's okay. Let's get him.
Let's get him in there.
-
- You're gonna be okay.
Yeah, I got the doors.
It's okay.
Okay, got you.
Got your head.
It's okay.
You're gonna be
at the hospital real soon.
Thank you so much.
Most people nowadays
won't even stop to help.
Danny?
JEAN:
Leave Daniel alone.
He didn't do anything.
Let's go.
Jean!
ED: Danny!
Jean!
WESTCOTT: Eddie.
Where is he?
Eddie?
- Is it her?
- It's Jean.
Eddie, give me the phone.
Come on.
JEAN:
Ed, what's going on?
Ed.
Hey.
Don't play any
fucking games with me.
Tell me where he is...
or I blow your head off.
If you shoot me, Eddie,
you'll never find him.
He'll starve to death.
Have you hurt him?
Eddie...
You don't have to find a vein.
Anywhere will do.
MAN: Come on, guys,
let's wrap him up.
It was Eddie's idea to beat up
Jamal Osman, wasn't it?
Yeah, well, it didn't take
too much fucking persuasion.
Confession had to be unusable.
Eddie made sure it wasn't,
got you to do it.
What are you talking about?
fuck, he must've paid those kids
to smash up the crime scene...
flooded the lav himself.
All these deaths are Eddie's fault.
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.
Jean.
Your face always made me
feel safer, Eddie.
You look older.
Well, it's taken its toll, I guess.
Yeah.
It's taken its toll.
The fuck are we gonna do, Eddie?
I'm sorry, Danny.
Eddie, what are we gonna do, man?
Help! fuck.
Oh! So you think
someone's gonna save you.
Get me out of this chair!
But no one can hear you.
No one knows you're here.
And if they did,
they'd probably Just turn up the TV.
ED: Don't let those bastards win.
Jean.
Don't let them make you
into this person.
See, I don't enjoy any of this!
You understand that, right?
ED: I know.
I
You killed a three-year-old boy, Jean.
He was Just a little boy.
No, I didn't kill him.
His mother did.
What's any of this prove, Jean?
fuck! Stop!
Elly was a coward,
you were a coward, I am a coward.
What the fuck are you doing?
Same as every fucking animal
in the Jungle, Jean.
That's right, Eddie,
that's what it proves.
-
- DANNY: Shit. What are you doing?
Oh, shit!
Help!
Help us! Come on!
- MAN: Wait till forensics...
-
JACK: Put a car up there.
Seal the whole fucking area.
MAN: Yes, sir.
What about here?
Help!
After I killed my mother,
all I thought about was dying.
I mean, even waking up was pain.
Oh, but then...
the equation, it was all so clear.
It wasn't about what you did,
Eddie, or what I did.
I mean, we were part
of something so much bigger.
It's fucking ugly!
Well, Gelb thinks it's beautiful.
Oh, fu...
DANNY: Eddie!
One night you came
to see me in the hospital,
and I was sobbing in your arms.
And I believed you.
I believed...
that you were sincere
and that you were angry...
and that you cared about me.
I did.
I did care.
No, 'cause the day that...
the day that the case collapsed...
I went to your house to Just...
tell you that I didn't blame you.
Well, I guess I Just really wanted
to see you, I think...
'cause you were...
the only one
who really understood...
what I'd been through.
And then I saw you both there.
Whatever happened
to Daniel's gun?
I threw it in the river.
Eddie.
What the fuck?!
What, you didn't know?
God, if you weren't so pretty,
you'd be safely in Jail.
I wasn't worth it, Eddie.
I wasn't worth it.
I... I ne-never wanted to hurt you.
Oh, I know I was never a factor,
because what you did, Eddie...
God, you know, I couldn't
understand for two years
the sheer pain of what
you put me through,
of what you did to me!
- Jean.
- But then with the equation...
...then it all made sense.
EDDIE: Please, Jean.
You were no different.
You were no different than Pierre...
-
...or Jamal or Elly or me!
You do fucking enjoy this!
You do!
Bitch!
Say, "You do
fucking enjoy this,
DANNY: I didn't say that!
This should be so easy for you.
I mean, you're not related.
You're not gonna have kids.
I'm sorry.
Danny, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Please, Jean.
Please.
JEAN: Oh, and then what, Eddie?
You're Just gonna let me
walk out of here in peace?
I mean...
yeah...
maybe you would.
Ohh! fu...
ED:
fuck!
I don't want to hear this.
Eddie.
fucking help him, man.
Shit.
Don't make me kill him.
JEAN:  Eddie.
I know what it's like
to have to make the choice
you're gonna have to make.
Just flick the switch.
You still believe he loves you.
How did it start?
He arrested me.
About a year before...
you.
And he let you off for a price,
is that how it worked?
Yeah.
JEAN: So, you used him
to stay out of Jail.
He doesn't love you, Eddie.
If this was his choice,
you'd be long dead by now.
flick the switch.
It's what we all do.
There is... no love.
DANNY:  Sorry, man.
So fucking sorry.
Kill me.
Eddie...
You want me to kill you?
I don't care if he loves me.
Let him go.
In my life...
...you're the only thing I don't regret.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
Oh, shit.
I'm scared.
Eddie.
- Eddie!
-
f-fuck.
Thank you.
DANNY:  Eddie, shit!
DANNY: Get me out!
- MAN: fuck.
- Get me out of here!
Clear!
Clear.
Let's move back.
Let's move, move!
fuck off!
What the fuck
are you looking at?
