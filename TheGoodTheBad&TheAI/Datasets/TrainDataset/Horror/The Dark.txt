WOMAN:
Some travel partner you are.
You're supposed to keep
the driver company, honey.
Okay?
This isn't it.
This is a road.
And here, look.
This is a road.
Is that the road
we're on, Mom?
There won't be any
signal out here.
We're not lost.
Shit.
We should have stayed
at a hotel in Cardiff.
We wanted to surprise
your dad, didn't we?
Don't you wanna
surprise your dad?
Shoot.
We're not lost.
Sweetheart.
Sarah.
Hey.
Sarah, time to go.
Sarah.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah!
Sarah!
Get out!
What is it?
Mom!
Mom, stop it!
It's just sheep!
SARAH:
Just some stupid sheep.
Ohhh.
I have a brilliant idea.
Why don't we go down and see
if we can find your dad's house.
What do you think?
Are you gonna tell him?
Do you want me to?
No.
Okay.
Where the hell are we?
Wow.
Ah, this is so your father.
Daddy!
SARAH:
Daddy!
Sarah.
Hey.
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting
to see you till tomorrow.
You're not upset
we're early?
I'm not upset at all.
I'm happy.
Hey, why the tears, huh?
I'm just happy to see you.
I'm happy to see you too.
Top of the morning
to ya, James.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, how are you?
Wow, wow, wow,
look at this house.
For you.
Oh, thank you very much.
Sarah wanted
to get here, so...
We actually arrived
last night,
but our car got stuck
in the mud down yonder.
I tried to call
but there's--
No signal.
--no signal.
So we had a little
sleepover in the car,
didn't we, baby?
And we had a close encounter
with some sheep.
SARAH:
Hah! Sure moved far enough.
Well, far-off is the way
us weirdoes like it.
Dafydd.
Would you mind giving us a hand
with Adelle's car later?
No, not at all.
JAMES:
Thanks.
This is Dafydd.
He can fix anything.
Hello.
Dafydd.
Is that like David?
Exactly like David.
Daf, Dai--
Dave.
Hey, Dave.
Missus.
Watch these.
Jeez, you're getting big,
aren't ya?
How old are ya? 18? 19?
Quite a nice little hideaway
you built for yourself.
Yeah, it's coming along.
Yeah, well...
Oh, I love this.
Look at you, painting
and sculpting like crazy.
There's an abattoir
on the property,
which I'll turn
into my studio.
Really?
What's an abattoir?
Place where they
kill animals.
Nice.
By the way,
your rooms are upstairs.
Can I go see?
Yeah, sure.
First door on your left.
Okay.
So...
So...
JAMES:
What's wrong with Sarah?
Nothing.
Just a bit of a loner.
Like father, like daughter,
I guess.
She's fine. We're fine.
We just missed you.
I...
I missed you.
Yeah, this is your room.
That's great.
Why, you've been
working a lot.
Look at this.
Yeah, I know, uh...
It's a bit of a mess.
I'll tell you what.
I'll find somewhere
to put the rest
of this stuff.
No, no. It's fine.
It's fine.
ADELLE:
Sarah, where are you?
I'm up here.
Oh, making a mess already?
ADELLE:
Wow, look at this place.
What do they open?
JAMES:
I have no idea.
We found them
all over the place,
but they don't seem
to fit any of the locks.
ADELLE:
This is a funky little room.
Yeah, it's a storage room
or something.
What are we gonna
store up here?
You. If you're bad.
And we'll
only let you out
when you out when you think
about what you did, young lady.
You like your room?
It's got a telescope.
Yeah.
You can watch out
for ships in distress.
SOS.
Save our souls.
SARAH:
Elvis.
Here, boy.
Elvis.
ADELLE:
Sarah?
Sarah, don't get
too close to the edge.
ADELLE:
Hey.
What'd you find there?
A secret.
A secret?
Looks like someone
made off with the plaque.
Now, why would they do that?
SARAH:
"Ann..."
"Annwyn."
Not Annwyn.
Annwn.
It's Welsh.
For what?
The place you go
after you die.
Like heaven?
That's right.
JAMES:
Sarah.
Better go and find Elvis.
Time to go.
I'll go with you, baby.
JAMES:
She's fine.
Be careful.
Elvis.
ADELLE:
What's it commemorate, anyway?
JAMES:
Stumblehead, isn't it?
ADELLE:
Stumblehead?
There were some people
lived up here
about 50 years ago.
Kept themselves
to themselves.
Made up their own religion--
SARAH:
Elvis!
--based on old Welsh legends.
Do unto others,
sin, salvation.
Same as most faiths.
So why put up a monument?
Well...
they had themselves
a kind of minister...
who preached them
sick up here.
Till one day, the lot of them
suddenly up and...
walked off that cliff,
looking for a way to end
their earthly sufferin'.
Jesus, what a way
to die.
They didn't think
they were dying.
They thought
they were going to Annwyn.
You wouldn't wanna
change your mind halfway down.
Sarah!
You okay?
I've got you, sweetheart.
You all right?
I don't know,
they just came right at me.
Oh, God, Sarah,
are you all right?
Oh, baby, look at your--
I'm fine!
Oh, God, look at--
I said I was fine!
She's fine,
Adelle.
ADELLE:
Oh, hello?
SARAH:
Where have you been?
Your mommy
has been a bad girl.
You've been out all night.
I'm going
to live with Dad.
Sarah, we've been through this
before, please.
I talked to him,
and he said--
I know he said that--
He said I could
stay as long as I wanted.
Yes. When you're done
with school,
you can go visit
with your father in England.
Wales!
I'm going to live with Dad.
Sarah.
I know what this is
all about, you know.
It's none of your
goddamn business.
SARAH:
It's all about you.
You don't love anybody
but your fucking self.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare ya.
It's okay.
What are you writing about?
Ooh, I see.
Secret, is it?
Girl stuff?
Everything all right
with ya?
You seem a little...
I don't know.
You want to talk
about anything?
No.
You sure?
No.
Be nice to your mother.
She does her best,
you know.
I've missed you.
I miss you too.
See you later.
Good night.
Good night.
SARAH: It's all about you.
You don't love anybody
but your fucking self!
Stop it!
ADELLE:
Oh, God.
See?
I hate you.
I hate you!
Sarah?
I can't stand this anymore!
Elvis!
Shut your noise!
It's just the bloody sheep!
P-A-I--
Paint.
You didn't let me
do the N or the T.
Give me another.
SARAH: Okay.
R-O-- Rock?
Dad, you did it again!
Okay, I'll let you
finish it this time. Honest.
JAMES:
L-O-S--
E? Lose?
No.
R.
Loser.
You calling me a loser?
Eh?
Well, if the shoe fits.
Can we go exploring?
Sarah?
Do you wanna
go for a walk?
ADELLE:
Hey.
JAMES:
Listen, I'll, uh--
I'll show you two a shortcut
down to the beach.
Yeah?
Here, but this on, baby.
Why?
Uh, because it's cold,
and you're gonna need it.
It gets a bit
chilly down there.
Fine.
Hey, Dave.
Ho, ho, ho, you don't
wanna come closer.
Dirty work.
These are from yesterday.
They fell from up there.
SARAH:
They didn't fall.
They jumped.
What do you mean,
"they jumped"?
They jumped.
I've seen sheep behave
in many an odd way.
But I've never seen them
do something like this
in a while.
Maybe they just got
plain fed up, huh?
Couldn't take it anymore.
What are you
gonna do with them?
Funeral pyre.
I'll give you a hand, Dafydd.
I'll catch up with you, yeah?
ADELLE:
I'm so happy we're here, baby.
Look at this place.
What'd you find there?
What is it?
Hey, be careful
on those rocks, all right?
GIRL'S VOICE:
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah!
Baby?
Sarah, let's get back
to your dad's.
Come on, chop-chop.
Sarah!
Come on, let's go.
Where are you?
Sarah! Let's go!
Sa--
Sarah?
Sarah, come out now.
It's not funny.
Sarah!
Sarah! James!
James! James!
Help us!
Jame--
ADELLE:
James!
Adelle!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Ja--
James! Help!
Adelle!
Help!
James!
Adelle!
Help!
Sarah!
Adelle!
Where's Sarah?
In the water!
She fell in!
Sarah!
Sarah!
My God. Sarah!
ADELLE:
I let her go.
Sarah!
ADELLE:
No, let me go!
Let me go!
He'll find her.
No!
Sarah!
I lost...
INSPECTOR: We'll begin again at
first light tomorrow morning.
But I must say it:
You should prepare yourself.
My daughter
could be alive out there,
waiting for us
to find her.
The boats have lights.
Your men have lights.
Then we search all fuckin' night
if we have to.
I can't stay here, Adelle.
I'm going down
to join the search.
Adelle.
We'll find her.
Promise.
I hate you.
Sarah!
I can't stand this anymore!
And on the count of three,
I want you to open this door.
Don't test me on this.
SARAH:
Mom!
One...
SARAH:
Mom, help me!
ADELLE:
James, help!
Oh, my God! Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Are you in here?
Sarah.
Oh, God.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Is that who you're looking for?
You won't find her here.
This is where the sheep
come to die.
The sheep?
But before they go,
they must have the filth
taken from them.
And that's what he
does for them.
With scrapes and hooks...
he cleans hell
from their heads.
He? Who is he?
The Shepherd.
All that you see--
--is of his making.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I told you,
you won't find her here.
Wait.
Just wait.
I want you to get me
in there, see?
Can you get me in there,
close to that shelf?
Not till the tide's back in.
JAMES:
How long?
Another hour.
I saw a girl.
You saw a girl?
Yes, out in the yard.
What?
I followed her out to the abattoir.
You went
to the abattoir?
Yes. She said something.
She said something
about the shepherd,
and she said something else,
something it Welsh,
I couldn't understand her.
Adelle.
I couldn't understand her.
Adelle, you saw Sarah.
And when I went
to touch her, she--
Please, Adelle.
You saw Sara.
No.
You cut your hand.
Why don't you let me
have a look at it.
I don't know why
I thought it was her,
but it wasn't.
It wasn't her.
It's okay.
It's all right.
It wasn't her.
ADELLE: Before we left New York,
Sarah and I had a fight.
I was a bad mother.
You weren't.
You aren't.
Mm.
You did your best. We both did.
And we made mistakes.
She loves you, Adelle.
We both do.
Shh.
Beg your pardon, missus.
I-I just came to pick up James.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm all right.
I was just, uh--
I was just...
I thought I heard something
upstairs tapping, and, uh...
Sarah and James
play this SOS game.
They used to play this game.
That's what
waiting here's like. It's...
How you holdin' up?
I don't know how
this could've happened.
I should have been there
with them.
Why don't you go back
and stay with her.
I'll let you know
if we find anything.
I wasn't there
when she was lost.
I want to be there
when she's found.
Who are you?
"Annwn."
Oh!
Jesus.
"May 16th, 1952.
"Put down six sheep.
Panicked."
Here, look at this.
Okay, okay.
"May 17th, put down seven sheep.
Burnt bodies to contain
illness. Cause unknown."
There's pages of it,
sheep dying for unknown reasons.
Uh, uh-- Sick shit.
Sheep dissection and trepanning,
and then--
And then over here it says, uh--
It says, "She is doing it.
She is killing the sheep."
Who is she? Who is she?
I don't know who she is,
Adelle. I don't know.
Okay.
Look at this.
All right, it's her.
The girl you saw
in the abattoir?
Yes.
The same girl I saw
the night Sarah went missing.
Adelle, we didn't find her.
Okay.
We didn't find her today.
Are you listening to me?
Yes! Yes, I'm listening.
Maybe we're just not looking
in the right places, all right.
This is crazy.
Can you hear yourself?
Can ya?
I'm down there, Adelle.
All those people are down there,
looking for our dead daughter.
And you're running around
the moors, drawing pictures.
Jesus.
I'm sorry. Adelle?
Find what you're looking for?
Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.
Uh, actually,
do you speak Welsh?
Only to bother the English.
Would you mind
looking at this for me?
Here.
Well, plain enough, it means:
"The children were received back
into the armpit of Annwn."
The armpit--
But probably, more like:
"The children were taken
into the embrace of Annwn."
Taken?
Welsh mythology is full
of that sort of thing.
The living and the dead crossing
back and forth, you know.
Like what?
Oh.
You found it there.
"Creiddylad."
She was pulled into Annwn
by a dark spirit.
Her husband had to cross over
to get her back.
"The Shepherd."
"The Shepherd and his flock."
"Mass suicide."
"The Shepherd
with his late daughter Ebrill."
Ebrill.
Is that
who you're looking for?
Ebrill.
Ugh!
Aagh!
James?
James.
Who's there?
Someone out there?
Who's out there?
Open the door.
Open the door!
GIRL:
I can't. I'm afraid.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Listen to me...
okay?
I'm gonna count to three.
And before I get to three,
you will have opened this door.
Okay?
One.
Sarah?
James, she's here.
Who's here?
Ebrill,
the Shepherd's daughter.
She's upstairs
in Sarah's bed.
Adelle, please.
She knows where Sarah is.
She knows. She knows.
You've gotta
believe me, James.
Sarah drowned.
Sarah is dead.
She's not. She's not.
I feel it. I know it, James.
Jesus, Adelle, it's over.
It's done!
We've called it off.
Do you get that?
I've called off the search!
EBRILL:
Hush. Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Mommy's here.
Ebrill?
Do you remember me
from the abattoir?
You know where Sarah is,
don't you?
James, look at her,
she knows this place.
She knows it.
This is the Shepherd's house.
ADELLE: Yes, this was the
Shepherd's house, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
And he lived here...
all by himself.
No, no, no.
He lived here
with you, Ebrill.
Don't you remember?
I was very sick.
EBRILL:
That's the room.
Show us.
Tell us about the room.
That's the room
where the Shepherd
kept his little lamb.
And never let her out,
no matter how she cried.
Ah, don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!
He'd take her out
to the place where the sheep
go to die.
Ugh! Aaagh!
The abattoir?
Your father cut your head, like
he did the sheep, didn't he?
EBRILL: And she begged and begged
him to stop hurting her head.
But the dark
had to come out of it somehow.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't you want
your lockbox back?
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
What's in the box, honey?
Please don't make me
go up there.
Tell me what's in the box!
No!
Adelle!
Listen to me.
She knows where Sarah is.
Stop it, Adelle.
Just leave it
for a minute, okay?
Let me talk to her.
Come on.
JAMES:
I can't help you
unless you tell me
where you came from.
Do you know
where your parents live?
Eh?
Do you know who you are?
Where you came from?
Why is she so angry at me?
She's not angry at you.
She's just very sad that our--
That our daughter is gone.
Did you love her?
Yeah.
Very much.
Do you think that she knew
that you loved her?
I--
I think so, yes. I hope so.
I think she did.
Look at you. You're filthy.
Let's get you cleaned up
and find someone
who knows who you are.
These should fit you.
Okay, when you're done,
you come talk to me, okay?
Don't worry.
Everything's
gonna be all right.
Ugh! Agh!
Adelle! Adelle.
What are you doing?
JAMES:
What's that?
ADELLE:
It's Sarah's sweater.
Oh, look at it.
James, it's a message.
From who?
From our daughter.
She's telling us
how to find her.
I know where she is.
What? Where?
Where is she?
She's gone...
to a much better place.
You know what this is,
don't you?
Do you know what this is?
This is Sarah's sweater!
Tell me where she is.
Adelle--
You know where she is,
don't you?
No!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Adelle.
This is insane.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That girl's head's
been cut open
more times
than I can account for.
Cut open?
Yes, she was bleeding
from what appeared
to be an unhealed
trepanning wound.
That's right, you heard me.
Trepanning. Primitive medicine.
Tapping or cutting
through the bone of the skull
to cure diseases
and mental illness.
Who would do such a thing
to a child?
I was hoping that you
might explain that to me.
S.
O.
S.
GIRL :
Mommy!
Help me.
I'm here.
Mom.
Fucker!
My daughter is alive.
Creiddylad.
The sweet young girl
taken beneath the waves
and held prisoner
in the land of the dead.
Ebrill has been dead
for 50 years,
and now she's here
living and breathing.
Explain that to me!
You should leave it.
Leave it?
Imagine what a parent
would do for their child.
Look at me!
Imagine what I'm willing to do!
That's what I've been afraid of.
She was a sickly girl
from birth.
And when she died,
more than he needed her
to be at peace.
His followers were
as his flock.
But he lied to 'em.
Played upon their fears.
Convinced them that this was
the way to paradise.
DAFYDD:
He believed the old legends:
DAFYDD: Annwn might give
back his child...
if he gave it
someone in return.
DAFYDD: He killed them all...
to bring her back.
That's what he was
willing to do
Hello.
What happened?
You fell down.
How are you feeling?
Hey, don't cry.
Everything's gonna be
all right.
You know what?
You know what you need to do?
You need to picture the thing
that you want
more than anything else.
Can you do that?
Don't tell me.
Don't tell anyone.
But just keep picturing
that thing that you want.
And one day
you'll find that you don't
have to picture it anymore.
It will be right there
in front of you.
Can you see it?
Can you be my daddy?
Oh, sweetheart.
I--
I can't.
Why not?
Because I already have
a daughter.
What if she never comes back?
Oh, my God, you were there.
Only I didn't jump.
My father did.
My mother did.
But I was too afraid.
I couldn't.
The Shepherd took me in.
And I helped him with the sheep
until Ebrill came back.
She came back.
She came back.
DAFYDD:
Alive.
But something came back
with her.
It was then
the sheep began to die.
DAFYDD: He locked her
in that room up there.
He tried to cut
the dark from her,
Please, no!
Don't, please.
Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt-- Aagh!
DAFYDD: But finally
I couldn't watch him
EBRILL:
Please, Dafydd, unlock the door.
Please.
EBRILL:
Father.
And the darkness in her
struck out.
She should never have been
brought back from death.
Because she has found
a way to return from Annwn.
And that way is Sarah.
My daughter is alive.
Get security immediately.
Yes, can I speak to my husband?
He came in with a patient there,
the-- The young girl found at
Ty Gwyneth earlier this evening.
I'm afraid your husband
has left.
The young girl
seems to be missing.
What?
Do you want to speak
to her doctor?
No, that's okay. Thank you.
Thanks very much.
We'll call you
if there's any news.
Ebrill's gone.
Are you sure
she'll be here?
She'll be here.
You wait here.
Ebrill, where are you?
I know you're here.
You remember me, don't you?
You can't stay on this side.
You know that.
You belong with the dead.
Ebrill?
Ebrill?
Oh, my God.
Dave?
Dave.
ADELLE:
Where are you?
Ebrill.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
Adelle?
Adelle?
Oh, Jesus.
They died because of me.
No.
Everyone dies
because of me.
No. No one's
gonna die anymore.
You can fix it.
You don't have to do it alone.
I'll help you, all right?
All right?
Okay.
She's cold down there...
and alone.
She's been calling to you.
I know. I heard her.
Looks like such
a long way down.
ADELLE:
But it's not. Really, it's not.
Ebrill! Ebrill.
Adelle. Don't let her.
James, wait.
Wait!
Ebrill.
Come away from there.
Come away.
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay.
Ebrill, I can be your father.
ADELLE:
No!
JAMES:
I can look after ya.
No!
Just come away from there.
ADELLE:
I know what I'm doing. Please.
JAMES:
Come away.
ADELLE:
Trust me.
No!
James...
EBRILL: Don't.
I am going to get our baby back.
EBRILL:
Father, help me.
Help. Help me!
There must be some other way.
EBRILL: No!
ADELLE: I'm going to bring--
No!
--our baby back!
Please, Adelle.
Oh, no.
JAMES:
No!
Oh, God, no.
Ebrill, where are we?
Sarah?
Where is she?
Where is Sarah?
And he doesn't
think you deserve her, either.
I'm taking her home.
GIRL'S VOICE:
Hurry!
Oh, baby.
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
Sarah.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Some little lamb has found
her way out through my wall.
CHILD'S VOICE:
Mom.
Sarah?
Go.
Mom!
And see what happened
to your little daughter.
Ah.
Oh.
Mom, is that you?
Sarah?
Follow me.
Ugh.
Mommy.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Mom. Mom. Mommy.
EBRILL:
Can't you see her?
Ebrill, is that you?
This is where all of us
sick little sheep
have the filth cut
from our heads.
We are not sheep.
Oh, yes, we are.
Especially you.
SARAH: Mom, help me. Hurry.
Help. Help!
Go see what you've woken.
Go see.
Now we'll finish
what you started.
Don't you wanna
come home, baby?
Sarah, I want you
to come home with me.
Home?
Yes.
Home?
Mother...
...home is where we came from.
Stop it!
See?
I hate you.
Sarah.
I can't stand this anymore!
Sarah.
Sarah.
Please, open the door.
I'm gonna count to three
and on the count of three,
I want you to open this door.
Don't test me on this.
One...
Sarah. Sarah?
Did you take these?
Oh, my God, Sarah.
Sarah, come here, baby.
Come here. Come here.
That's a girl. Come here, baby.
Sarah. That's it.
Sarah.
Don't die.
Don't you want the dark
to come out of your head?
Yes.
Don't you wanna be clean of it?
Yes.
Don't you want me back, Mom?
Yes, I do.
Then this is the only way.
Stop!
There, that's it.
How could you do such a thing?
I don't know.
I don't know where it came from.
It just happened.
It just happened.
EBRILL:
You killed her.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I just want a second chance.
Please, God,
I want a second chance.
The dead
don't get second chances.
SARAH'S VOICE: Mother.
You know what this is,
don't you?
EBRILL:
It's the end.
No. No. No.
No, no, no...
I want a second chance.
The dead
don't get second chances.
I'm not dead.
I am not dead.
Oh, yes, you are.
Don't you remember?
We fell from Stumblehead.
The water filled your lungs.
ADELLE:
No. I'm alive.
Yes. Yes, a drug overdose.
Please, now. Oh, God.
Sleeping pills.
Some kind of sleeping pill!
Okay. Okay. Don't die.
Don't die on me.
I'm alive.
I'm alive. I'm alive.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.
You're alive.
I'm alive.
EBRILL:
One of the living
for one of the dead.
SARAH'S VOICE:
Mom. Mom.
Sarah.
Mommy.
Sarah.
Mom, is that you?
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Mom.
I'm here.
Sarah, are you in there?
Sarah, I can't--
I can't open the door.
Sarah!
Mom.
Sarah. Sarah.
Oh, God, I want to tell you.
I need to tell you.
I am so sorry
for being so selfish.
I'm so sorry for everything.
And I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Mommy.
Baby. Oh, my baby.
Oh, my baby.
Oh, my baby.
Sarah?
Sarah!
SARAH:
Daddy.
Daddy.
Sarah.
James.
JAMES:
Okay.
Underwater?
I kept calling for help.
I kept calling for Mom.
JAMES:
I can't believe it.
I can't believe
you've come back.
She was right. She was right.
SARAH: Daddy?
JAMES: Yeah?
Where's Mom?
Oh, Sarah, she...
I'm sorry.
Your mother...
I'm right here.
Listen to me, Sarah.
She loved you so much.
She did a very brave thing.
But she's gone now.
Look at me.
No.
It's just the two of us.
I can take care of ya.
Look at me.
No, no, no.
It's all right, Sarah.
It'll be fine.
I'll take care of ya.
Look at me!
Come here.
Don't cry.
I can't help it.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
I wanna go home, Daddy.
Please, take me home.
JAMES:
Yes, we will.
I want you to forget, Sarah.
Mom.
I want you to be happy,
to forget all about this.
Dad. Me.
I love you, baby.
I love your dad too.
I know that now.
Sarah.
Sarah.
S--
Sarah?
Is that who you're looking for?
What?
You won't find her here.
What?
What did you just say?
No.
You're not Sarah.
You're her. You're in her.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're not Sarah.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
You brought your daughter back,
Adelle.
You did a very brave thing.
Why?!
SARAH:
When I was lost,
I kept picturing
this one thing.
One thing
I wanted more than anything.
I wouldn't have
to picture it anymore.
And what did you picture?
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
