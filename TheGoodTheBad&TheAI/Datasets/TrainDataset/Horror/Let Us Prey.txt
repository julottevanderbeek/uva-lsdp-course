To be sure - and there he is,
Something you have to swallow, Caesar,
Is nice if you have more time than

We thought we doing you a favor
and bring the school to you,
Why is he here?
Because he just like his women
likes his whiskey - 12 Years Old?
Constable Heggie, Mr, Beswick,
You complain yet
constantly about class sizes,
This is our way to help
with some private lessons,
That's it, right? He is a fanatic,
I knew it, Dirty pervert,
Go back, away from the door,
-How's It twice with "please", bitch?
What the hell? That's assault,
Man, fuck brutality!
Just do it,
what is said to you, bitch,
Okay, all right,
You saw that, right?
You are my witness,
She was trying to break my arm,

Oh come on, wake up!
If we approach this correctly,
we are still before the last
Round out here,
You simply have to say,
what you have seen,
I'll sue you, and this
Be photographed scratches,
Sometimes, Francis,
need to be disciplined people,
This preserves the natural order,
Is that what you did? '
I have read the file,
Pretty dirty,
how to maintain order, right?
Well, every story has two sides,
-sure, Of course,
Yours is certainly true maudlin,
So one, my boy, is commonly
known as a wire brush,
The salvage people do not respond,
I need to call a tow truck later,
Provoke getting your prisoner?
In fact, I do not even smoke,
Types such as Caesar come with
Authority not well understood,
So I use a number
different methods,
And cell 4?
He seems pretty convinced of
Ralph?
This man needs a sandbag,
His wife is for all
certainly not suitable,
He is also a regular guest here?
-You Can set the clock after,
And I guarantee that it tomorrow
early the charges will drop,
Unfortunately, a widespread problem,
If there is abuse in relationships,
Oh, that's so, Constable?
The little girl,
the back, came here,
The world is full of evil,
That goes double for police stations,
Hey, hey, calm, buddy, This way,
Ah, you must be the new one,
Mundie,
We've known,
I ,,, just kidding, you know?
Good work, Mundie,
Heggie? Warnock,
Is that him? 1 meter 80, beard,
pretty spaced out,
Yes, he is,
They are straight before
run a car, what?
He has a blow off in any case,
When we found him, he wandered around,
He was right in front of us,
and then just go away,
Probably due to the adrenaline,
-Yes, But adrenaline decreases,
Better call to Dr, Hume,
His number is on the wall,
What is your name, sir?
Cosy chat is
not with him, Sarge,
Hi, I'm calling from the police station,

Space, boy,
Now let us all Medical Play, yes?
Where is he?
To the patient, please click here along, Doctor,
Its injuries seem
just to be on the outside,
No evidence of toxicity,
So he has a clear head?
He definitely has something about him,
So I would say "yes",
His silence could be voluntary,
Then he comes over night in a cell,
Why that? His refusal to talk about?
Well then we just vagrancy,
In addition, he is tonight
went before a car, right?
Until you his identity
have found
it is probably best if he stays here,
Have you found a name, Constable?
No, No wallet, no ID,
no phone, no key,
Only this book, which is full of names,
Just what is his?
If any, Maybe he just
only the phonebook depreciated,
There is something compulsive,
There are small icons, small characters,
It must have a meaning for him,
I told you so,
the guy has a Hau away,
Since you can sometimes nice
determine Heggie, right?
Find out! Try it
times during the pat mills,
Maybe even a missing security wing

And damn lifeless it is,
I beg your pardon? What did he just say?
Doctor Hume?

Sins are paid for with blood,
And I ,,,

"And that slay me,

And yet we're stuck here together firmly,
in the midst of offenders,
Right there you are also out -
