Cut it out. Oh!
Don't.
What's the matter?
I just haven't seen you laugh
like this in a long time.
No, it's, uh... it's nice.
I miss it.
I miss it, too.
We're gonna work this out,
right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Trevor...
I hope it's everything
you want it to be.
It will be.
It will be.
-
-
- Oh, shit!
- Aaah!
It's not... it's stuck.
- Calm down. Relax.
- I can't.
Help me! Somebody!
No!
No!
No!
No!
You're safe now.
Where's Kirsty?
Where's my wife?
This should help you relax.
-
-
Okay?
Trevor?
Trevor!
It's imperative
that you stay calm.
Over the course
of this... procedure,
What are you people
doing to me?
Now, just relax, Trevor.
Welcome back.
How are those headaches?
Any change
in the intensity?
My name is Allison.
You a dream, too,
Allison?
Still hallucinating,
huh?
I mean, it...
it looked like a dream,
but it just felt so...
Real?
Yeah.
It's probably
the morphine, Trevor.
We're still gonna have to
run a few more tests
to see if we can pinpoint
what's causing your headaches.
With the kind of head trauma
you've suffered,
you're lucky to be here
at all.
I'm gonna see you
through this.
I'm gonna take your word
on it.
Back again, huh?
What seems to be the trouble
this time?
blackouts, hallucinations,
acute memory loss.
I recommend that we admit him
until we run the rest of the tests.
Well, I don't see
any abnormalities.
start coming to the hospital for
the sole purpose of getting a fix.
We can't have that.
Hey, doc...
Where's Kirsty?
Where's my wife?
I'd
I knocked.
What do you mean
she's missing?
Oh, it's not like we're gonna
stop looking, Mr. Gooden.
I don't give up that easy.
Well, what if I took you
back there, you know,
and walked you through it?
We've done that already...
over a month ago.
What?
You sure
you're okay to drive?
Look, obviously,
I caught you at a bad time.
Go home, get some rest.
You look like
hell warmed over.
Thanks.
Oh, one more thing.
You said you tried to pull
her out of the passenger side,
but the door was locked,
right?
Yeah.
Well, that's strange,
because the report says...
the doors were open
when the car was pulled
from the river.
I'm...
Maybe she unlocked them...
you know, swam out.
Maybe.
I'll double-check.
Could be their bad.
Anyway...
Gotta run.
We'll talk soon.
Sure I can't give you
a lift?
Suit yourself.
Hey, you mind
turning that down?
Well, I, um...
Music... D-Do you mind
turning that down?
Well, well, well.
Look who decided
to show up today.
Hey.
Bankers' hours
must be nice, huh?
Hey, um, what happened
to you yesterday?
Hey, I got a...
You got a piece of ass,
didn't you?
That's why you didn't
come back from lunch.
Secret's safe with me,
pal.
We'll call it a, uh,
personal day, okay?
Right.
Look, um, forget
I said anything, okay?
Hills have eyes, remember?
We're all here for you, Trev.
Hey...
to low blood-sugar levels, Trev.
Yeah.
Grab yourself a cookie.
Come on.
Oh, now what?
-
- Aah!
See anything you like?
Come on, speak up.
I'm trying to run
a business here.
Right. Uh, I'm sorry. I just, you know...
I just kind of spaced for a second.
Huh. Well, don't let it
happen again.
Right.
Or I may have to
get rough with you.
What?
I know what you like.
- Ugh!
- Hmm?
Trevor, it's me...
Gwen.
Hey, this is moving
just a little too fast here.
Don't tell me
Mr. Mario Andretti's
giving me a speeding ticket.
Hey, wait.
My wife just died, you know.
Come on, what are you...
what are you doing?
I know.
It's perfect.
Mmm, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.
What the hell
are we doing?
Nothing we haven't done
before.
We'll pick this up
later.
Now get some
fuckin' work done.
We're watching you.
Oh, my God.
Mmm, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.
Uh, hello?
Thank you
for coming down, Trevor.
Yeah.
How's that head of yours
feeling?
It's, uh, better.
Thanks.
We still haven't been able
to locate your wife,
although Missing Persons
turned up some evidence
that suggests foul play
may have been involved.
Foul play? What?
For one thing,
there were no skid marks
on the bridge,
there was nothing wrong
internally with the vehicle either.
It's like the car was driven
off the bridge intentionally.
I just... I just
lost control, you know,
We went off the bridge. I tried
to get her out, but I couldn't.
Look, I've told you
everything I can remember.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I just...
Don't take it the wrong way.
I'm just a guy trying to do
a job here, okay?
I mean,
between your head injury
some really strong
pain medication,
you may have forgot something
about the crash that could help us,
and everything
you  told us
could just be
the medication talking.
So, we'll be revisiting
things a lot around here...
No. No.
Trevor,
are you still in there?
Uh, she was trapped
inside and...
Well, apparently
she got out,
and therein lies a problem.
If we have
any more questions...
... you'll get a call
from myself or my partner,
You guys know something
that I don't?
All things considered,
uh...
we probably know
a lot less than you do.
Have a good afternoon,
Trevor.
Yeah.
What's the matter, boy?
Shit.
What's happening?
I did it.
Well,
what do you think?
I was gonna get it
on my ass,
but I thought
this was sexier.
Hey.
Oh, yeah, that's, uh,
um...
I knew you'd like it.
Oh, uh, you know,
I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh...
I'm having a weird day...
really weird.
Oh, okay.
It's definitely, um...
missing the woman's touch
it used to have.
Yeah. I know.
Well, if you, um...
feel like... talking
or whatever...
you know where I am.
Are you okay?
Not at all.
Strange, strange,
strange.
You see, tonight, I've got
something planned for you,
something I've been planning
for a  time.
Planning what?
I can't believe
you got me a present.
Where did you get this?
...
Hello?
Hello?
Miss me?
Jesus Christ, Gwen. You
scared the shit out of me.
What's this?
This innocent bit's
getting a little old.
Don't you think?
Sit.
Where is it?
Where's what?
You usually have it
up and running by now.
You're a bad boy.
Yeah, that's the Trevor
I know.
Uh, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah...
Oh, unh, unh, unh, unh,
unh, unh-unh.
Get off me.
Go ahead, get up.
Get up.
You're kidding me.
Uh, no, I'm not.
You have definitely got
a screw loose.
You can say goodbye
to that promotion.
I know what you like.
Oh...
Oh, Trevor.
Oh, that's it.
Oh...
Mmm... mmm...
Trevor, that's perfect.
Oh...
Yeah. Oh...
Oh, come on.
Trevor, mmm...
Mmm...
Oh...
Oh... oh...
Oh! Aah! Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah! Aaah!
Gwen, what...
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aaah!
Aaaah!
No!
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Look, man...
You don't understand.
I got some seriously
weird shit going on.
That accident fucked you up
more than I thought.
Hey, um... you know what?
I'm gonna hook you up,
man.
She'll take
one look at you
and know exactly...
what you need.
look busy, all right?
Just relax.
Do they happen in conjunction
with hallucinations?
Uh, well, sort of.
My head's been in constant
pain ever since the accident,
and, uh, it just seems to increase
whenever I get those, you know...
Dreams?
No, more like nightmares,
really.
I mean...
uh, it just seems so real.
That's your subconscious
talking to you.
It's trying to
tell you something
about your waking life.
So...
What's the mirror for?
To help you look into
your soul.
trapped by a wife who
suffocates you with forgiveness.
Yeah.
Something final...
without remorse...
Wherever there is hate,
violence, depravity...
a door
will always be found.
Merchant and Sage: It is a means
to break the surface of the real.
Agggh!
Ugh! Agh!
Which do you find
more exhilarating, Trevor...
the pain or the pleasure?
Personally, I prefer pain.
Agggh!
Is there something wrong?
No.
No, I'm okay.
Shall I get that for you?
Hello?
But I don't...
I don't understand.
How could this be a... a homicide
case when there was no murder?
The last time anybody saw
this woman, she was alive.
You seem pretty certain
that she's dead.
Hey, detective, I saw
my wife drown in our car.
Yeah.
Right.
You know, I've done
my homework on you, man.
You're, uh... you're real smart
with numbers, aren't you?
Where are you going
with this?
How many zeros
was your wife worth?
We had nothing.
had nothing.
She had a nice little
inheritance
Uh...
I'm sorry, what?
Don't play fucking stupid
with me, all right?
Kirsty's father
and Uncle Frank
had several sizeable
financial holdings
when they passed away...
under some rather, uh...
unusual circumstances.
You know...
I- I don't know.
Kirsty, she never liked
to talk about her past.
Well, maybe that's because
she didn't really trust you.
It seems that she's
the sole beneficiary,
so if Kirsty's dead,
like you seem
so fucking certain,
...
I swear to God, man, I don't
know anything about that.
Hmm.
My partner...
Detective Lange...
he's a little softer
around the heart than I am.
When I get a feeling about
something, I'm usually right.
And I got a bad feeling
about you, Trev.
Real bad.
God forbid we let one event
go unrecorded.
Just like I thought.
Nothing.
Hey.
borrow something?
Um...
Yeah, sure.
What do you want?
You.
Uh...
Now...
I'm feeling kind of
weird here, you know?
It's getting hot in here,
no?
weird.
It's almost like...
I'm with somebody else.
Tie me up.
Come and get it.
Uhh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Aah!
All problems solved.
Uh...
Man, you're alive.
Ohh!
I have some serious
space issues.
What... did you want?
Uh, right. Um...
We need to talk...
you know, about what we did
last night.
W-What?
Who's in there with you?
Are you having
a nervous breakdown
or something?
Hey.
What can we do for you,
chief?
Who are you?
If you know Tawny,
you better know me, pal.
Hey, uh, I'm sorry.
It's my mistake.
I'll talk to you later.
Let's make it  later!
Get in there.
Detective Givens: I'm telling you
right now your boy killed the boss.
Detective Lange: No, I'm not
too sure about the wife.
What are you doing
to find my wife?
Well, I can assure you
we're doing everything in our
power to find your wife, Trevor.
What about that message you left
on my answering machine?
What's your relationship
with Gwen Stevens?
What?
We appreciate you
coming down.
-
-
- So that's all for now?
- Yeah.
What?
She was my boss.
And that's it?
Yeah, that's it.
What did  tell you?
Nothing.
We leave no stone unturned
around here, Trevor.
You think I did it.
Hey,
I'm on your side here.
Then would you please tell me
what the  is going on?
I wish I knew.
Yeah. I'll bet.
Once you choose to open the
bo x and unleash its power,
there is no returning.
No, the price
is far greater,
They  do.
Whoa!
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah, I know,
I was just... you know.
Can I get you anything?
Uh, no.
No. I'm okay.
You okay?
I don't know, Allison.
I think I, um...
I think I really
screwed everything up.
Come on, Trevor.
You can't blame yourself.
Yeah.
I miss her.
I miss my wife.
It sounds like you're
remembering more and more,
and that's a good thing,
Trevor.
Maybe you're not the angel
that you thought you were.
Yeah.
Come on. You're gonna
get through this, Trevor.
Hey, Bret...
Come here.
We need to talk.
Look, Trev,
I'm really, really busy.
I got a stack of reports
due by 3:00.
The suits upstairs are all
over my ass on this one, okay?
- What'd you tell the police?
- Nothing they didn't already know.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I didn't tell them anything
they didn't already know.
Hey, Bret, why don't you help me
out here, man? They think I did it.
Did what?
Killed Kirsty.
I got a... report
to... do.
Just make yourself
at home.
Oh, already have.
Why are you here,
detective?
We found this curious
little object
No prints.
Forensics scraped a little dark
residue that was caked on it.
Want to take a guess
what they found?
Uh, no, but somethin' tells
me that you're gonna tell me.
Blood, Trevor.
Matched some of the blood we
took from the seat of your car.
Can you tell me
anything about it?
I- I-I... It...
It looks familiar,
you know?
Like most things
these days.
I- I think
it was in the car.
Gee... you think so?
Think about it, Trevor.
Give me something
to go on here.
I got Givens ready to drag
you in today on murder charges.
Help me get him off my back...
off of  back.
It was an accident,
detective,
just like I've been saying
all along.
Somebody's gotta believe me.
I believe you, Trevor.
Yeah.
But so far...
I'm the only one who does.
Look, I-I'm sorry, okay?
We need to talk.
What's up?
It's getting a little weird
around here, so, um...
I quit.
Today's my last day.
You know, I figured
it was the perfect time
to say "Fuck you" to the morons
around here and make a serious change.
Well, now, Bret, that's...
that's...
Look, uh... i know you got your,
uh, golden egg all lined up,
and that's cool, but the rest of us
gotta make some hay for ourselves,
'cause frankly, this job
ain't paying the bills anymore.
We're not all drinking from the
cash cow, like your wife was.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
Yeah.
The money.
Don't play stupid, man...
Kirsty's inheritance.
I'm talking about
the plan.
You know,
let's get out of here.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hey, whoa, whoa, Bret.
What did you tell Lange?
- Oh, come on, Trev. What the hell's wrong with...
- No, no, no!
Did you tell him about Gwen...
a- about the inheritance?
I didn't tell him
anything.
You know, we're all here
for you, Trev.
Agh! God!
Agh!
God!
Shit.
God!
Shit.
I gotta go, man.
Well, let me
give you a...
a ride.
Agh!
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Um, I'd like to speak
to Dr. Allison Dormire.
Hello. Yeah, hi.
What do you mean
she's not there?
S- She's  there.
She's a resident.
All right, hey, look...
Can you... can you please
help me find her? Please?
Hello?
Damn it.
Damn.
Your body's
completely healed.
If there is any pain
in your head...
it's in your head.
Your soul... is locked up
inside you,
and you need to free it,
Trevor.
You blocked yourself
from the healing process,
and that's what
we need to do now...
heal your soul.
The only way to do that
is to give in utterly.
Do you know what I mean
by giving in?
No.
It's about trust.
Do you trust me...
implicitly?
I don't know
what's real...
or what isn't real anymore.
How can I trust anybody?
You can trust me.
Surrender yourself
to your past.
Are you willing
to partake?
Ambulance.
Remember what happened
back there?
Some woman on top of me
naked, trying to kill me.
Uh, yeah,
not quite that good.
Um, you were riding
on a bus,
and then you just collapsed
onto the floor, out cold.
Do you remember
riding on a bus now?
No.
Oh...
Maybe. I don't...
Well, what'd you do
this time?
Oh, yeah, couple of stitches
will fix that right up.
Hey, where's Allison?
- Allison?
- Yeah, Allison Dormire.
...
I'm sorry. We don't have any
resident by the name of Allison.
Look, my nurse will
numb this up, and, uh...
I'll get right back
to you.
- Remember, we're all...
- You're all here for me. Go ahead, say it.
Jesus Christ!
I'm so tired of this shit!
- Trevor! Trevor!
-
Okay, you caught me.
At least let me finish,
will ya?
Knock yourself out.
Trevor? I heard you were looking
for me.  Is everything all right?
Allison, hey.
No.
I'm not all right.
Look, I, um...
think I've done some very...
bad things.
It's part of life.
Until now, you couldn't
remember parts of your past,
and now they're all
hitting you at once.
It's a shock
to the system.
You can't undo your past.
And sooner or later, you're
gonna have to confront it.
And it frightens me
to think
that I can't be there
for you when you do.
-
- Yeah, but I was starting to think I was going,
-
- What?!
Who the hell
are you talkin' to?
- Agh!
-
Detective Lange: What's your
relationship with Gwen Stevens?
I know about Gwen...
and the others.
What the fuck?
Aaah!
Where are you?
What have you done
to me?
Fuck.
What the fuck
is happening to me?
Where are you,
Goddamn it?!
Who are you?
Still in the dark?
This game is over.
Oh, I hear everything.
And soon you will
everything...
much more than you want,
I guarantee it.
What is this?
Why are you doing this
to me?
Is it so difficult
to face your demons?
Unh-unh. Y...
None of this is real.
not real.
You can't run
from your past.
You killed them.
You killed Gwen...
and the others.
And now you're trying
to pin it on
The killer is amongst us,
yes.
Ow! Fuck!
God... damn it!
Where you been, Trev?
Been looking all over
for ya.
Jesus!
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.
Tonight was supposed to be
the night, Trev, remember?
Oh, right, uh,
you don't remember anything.
Well, let me remind you
about your plan.
We'd kill Kirsty,
make it look like a suicide.
You'd get all her money,
and we'd split it 50/50... huh?
None of that's
gonna happen now, is it?
No, you had to go solo with
your little car-accident bit,
and then
you fucked it all up.
What were you thinking, Trev...
that I'd look the other way
and forget
about our little deal?
- I don't know...
-
Gotta tell you, buddy... the amnesia
routine's starting to get a little fuckin' old.
Lange's onto you,
and it's only a matter of time
before he's onto
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in prison.
I'd rather spend it
in Hell...
...with you.
Oh, my God, Bret,
what did you do?
Oh, God.
No, you're not real!
Get out of my head!
Sage...
Sage...
Oh, no.
Ohh...
Trevor...
Oh... you don't understand.
I didn't...
Save it.
You don't need
to say a thing.
No, it's, uh...
you know...
You have the right
to remain silent.
What's going on here,
detective?
Please, you can't believe
that I did this.
Detective, believe me.
I didn't do what
you think I did. Please...
Relax, Trevor.
You want to tell me exactly
what happened back there,
or should we just play the
headache game a little longer?
Okay.
We'll do it your way.
This is Lange.
Really?
Well, I-I-I got him sitting
right in front of me now.
Well, one thing's
for sure...
This ain't
your lucky day.
They found a body
this morning in the river.
They're bringing it
into the morgue now
so you can identify it.
Is it my wife?
You stay put.
Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember happening,
in your own words, exactly the
way you told Detective Lange,
but I want you to make
one... minor adjustment.
What's that?
Don't fucking lie
to me.
I just want to see my wife,
man.
I thought I asked you
to stay put.
Each killed with a single
gunshot wound to the head...
This way.
Sick motherfucker!
Get off me!
I'm gonna wring
your scrawny fuckin' neck!
Got quite the fan club.
Ugh! Agh!
Here we go.
Just about there.
Thanks.
Whoa. What are you...
What are you doing?
I thought you believed me.
Believe?
Here's what I believe,
Trevor...
I believe you and me
have a lot in common.
I believe each of us
are the sum
of two entirely different
people.
No.
I know who I am.
And I'm not a killer.
Denial to the end...
That's what
I like about you, kid!
Good and bad, Trevor...
Honest, dishonest...
Righteous and evil...
That's how
we're all made.
It's a little of both.
It's just a question...
of how much... of each.
And we're made up of just
the right parts of both.
A little heavy
on the evil, huh?
It's all good, Trev!
What the fuck?
Kirsty?
It seems you've reached
the end of your journey.
I told you you couldn't
run from your past forever.
and you must atone.
it is time for you
to pay the price.
I just want to see
my wife.
In time.
Let me see my wife.
I said, "In time"!
Agh! Aah!
Aaah!
Ugh!
Aagh!
Ohh!
Ugh!
All problems solved?
Not so simple,
I'm afraid.
You were
an interesting study.
Aggh!
Lust, greed, deception...
Fertile ground,
but rather mundane.
Let us take
one final journey together.
Let me help you remember
once and for all.
It's just a puzzle.
Open it up.
I trusted you.
I trusted you!
Goddamn it!
You told me you loved me!
Just open
the fuckin' box.
We were uninvited guests at your
little celebration...
Is this what you want?
...unseen by you.
I hope it's everything
you want it to be.
You were nothing more
than bait...
Kirsty...
We meet again.
How did you find me?
and it will not be closed
until I get what I came for.
My soul.
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
You solved the puzzle.
You unleashed the power.
and what I want is you.
Wait!
Wait.
What if I make you
a deal?
Interesting.
I will bring you five souls
in exchange for mine.
You would bring them
to me yourself?
You'll get your five.
Three of your favorite
companions,
most supple
and delicious...
...and the man with whom
you once conspired
to kill Kirsty...
They are all with  now.
and that, as you now know,
was  our contract.
- Agh! Ugh!
-
that you will wish
you had not...
All those women...
- No, Kirsty, come on...
- Don't you lie to me!
Don't!
- You gotta believe me.
- I am done believing! I trusted you!
I can't believe this shit is
happening, man. I had a fuckin' deal.
No, you  a deal...
but I made
a better offer.
And guess what?
He took it.
Reality.
Fuck.
I'm the fifth soul.
Yeah, that's him.
Okay, people.
That's it.
He just shot himself.
Next thing I knew,
we were in the water.
There...
I couldn't see anything.
I lost him.
You did what you could.
I'm sorry.
It just doesn't make
any sense...
that he would be capable
of murder.
We found the gun in your car.
It appears to be the same.
If it matches, I think we
may have found our killer.
Come on.
Hmm.
Wasn't your lucky day,
was it?
You checked the oral cavity
for blockages?
Oh, what do we got here?
And we have a winner.
Okay, zip it up.
We'll finish at the morgue.
Wait. Wait.
Sorry I had to leave you
like that for a minute, Trev,
but I'm back.
Jesus, Allison.
What possesses you
to talk to cadavers?
What if
there's no afterlife?
Wouldn't you want someone
to talk to
like a normal human being
one last time?
and I'm the coroner.
I've arranged
a ride home for you,
so I guess
you're free to go.
Thank you, detective...
for everything.
Uh, one more thing.
We found it in the car.
Yeah. It was...
my anniversary gift.
Oh.
You know, I was gonna
turn it in as evidence...
but I'll tell you what...
Why don't you
take it home?
Something
to remember him by.
Of course.
Thank you.
