Fenix.
Please...
Eat like a human being.
Grr!
You can't just stay here all the time,
not seeing anyone.
Now come on, stand up.
Come on now. Your foot.
That's it.
The other one.
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo,
the greatest show on earth!
The death-defying trapeze girl!
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!
The elephant from darkest Africa!
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!
Aladin, the world's smallest
elephant trainer! Roll up! Roll up!
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...
Papa! Wake up, wake up! They're here!
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!
Why does he drink so much?
My mother says
he killed a woman in America.
And he can't go back?
Tough life. Come on,
let's go see the new act.
- The new act?
- Yes!
The Tattooed Woman!
Now come on.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Don't be afraid!
Come on!
You can't do anything!
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.
Come on, don't just stand there!
I should have left you in the poorhouse
when your mother died. Now practice!
Or I'll beat you.
What's goin' on here?
Oh, Mr Orgo.
Here I am.
Hmm.
Ahh!
- The ocean!
- Oh!
- Ooh!
- It's a peacock!
- Ooh!
- It's the moon.
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.
- And a crab!
- The ocean!
Ooh!
Nice to meet you.
Come with me.
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr Orgo.
Ohh! Ah!
Blasphemy! Idiots!
Sacrilege!
Mother! Mother!
Blasphemy! This is our church!
All right, get them off my land right now
or I'll run 'em over!
Go ahead - but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!
No!
No! Don't hurt her!
We are not afraid of you.
El fin del mundo se acerca ya
Toda esperanza se acabará
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama
No hagas duro tu corazón
Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección
Peace! I bring peace.
- Come now.
- Father.
Peace.
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.
I won't let them do such a thing.
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.
This is it, Monsignor.
This is where we worship...
our beloved saint and martyr.
Here she is, Monsignor.
But...this is no saint.
Monsignor, she is a saint.
How could you?
Right here, many years ago,
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked
by the Terrano brothers.
She tried to fight them off
with all her strength
but they cut off her arms.
They raped her
and left her to die in a pool of blood.
And on this ground, miraculously
still wet with her holy blood,
we built our church.
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!
Holy blood! It's holy blood!
It's holy blood!
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.
I order you to stop...
this foolish sacrilege...immediately.
Never! This is our saint!
The church will never
recognise...this heresy!
Don't dare! Holy blood!
¡Cantemos todos!
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Come, Kevin, I don't want this
to soil your pure soul.
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!
Holy blood.
Holy blood!
- Holy blood! Holy blood! Oh!
- Holy blood!
Go ahead!
Don't run away!
Mother! No!
- No, no! No, no!
- No.
Kill me! Go ahead!
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me!
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!
Go ahead...
Hey!
Ahh...
Mr Orgo...
Aah!
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him...
or I'll kill you!
She's crazy!
Get up. Get up!
You bastard!
Aaah.
Ahh. Ahh.
Aaah.
My little child.
No...
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!
Don't do that!
Ahh. Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Hah!
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.
Vamoose. Vamoose.
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.
Please, don't die.
Please.
Don't die.
Stop crying...like a little girl.
I'll give you a charm.
That'll make you a man.
There, now you're a man.
Just like me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!
Hanging by her own hair!
Put me down! Put me down!
Quick, quick! Down! Down!
Quick. Quick.
Go away!
Music! Music!
Concha!
Mummy! Mum!
Shh! Get in the trailer.
Keep quiet. Go! Go...
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
Ugh.
Come on.
No!
Come here, come on, come on. Come on.
This is Fenix.
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Thanks, Fenix.
Come along now.
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.
Now, Fenix. Thank you.
Form a circle!
Good boy, Fenix.
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!
Go on!
Music.
And now...we will have some fruit!
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!
One for you...
New friends, Fenix.
Rudolph,
Mauricio,
Daniel,
Marcos,
and Darío.
They are going to the movies tonight.
And you are going with them.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Come on, my dear.
Here we are, out you get.
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.
Now we will see a great film
about Robinson Crusoe.
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe,
one of life's castaways.
Yes. Good boy, Darío.
Goodbye. Goodbye!
I have to go with my grandmother.
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.
Good morning.
I am Robinson Crusoe.
Bye! Enjoy the movie!
And don't worry, we will wait for you.
Come along.
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.
Listen, this kind of stuff
will make you sick.
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else...
that's much more fun than the movies.
A little sniff of this...
And we'll see.
Sniff.
Ándele para adentro.
¡De la buena!
Yes, yes.
¡Vamos amigos!
Hai!
Here.
There you go, Lores.
How much for the five pendejitos?
For all of them, $20.
Five for you, 15 for me.
Ohh...
Vengan, vengan chaparritos
al hotel.
Mm. Me los voy a comer.
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.
- Like me?
- ¡Mírame!
Mírame, dame un trocito.
Hai!
Ahh...
Hai!
Fenix?
- Have fun last night?
- Mm-hm.
How do you feel?
Good! Very good.
Now eat, hm?
I'll be back later, all right?
All right, out we go. Out we go. Today
we have home-made chicken soup.
Fenix!
Siento en el alma
Unas ganas inmensas
De llorar
Tu me haces falta
Y juré no decírtelo jamás
Yo quiero hacerte
Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas
Déjame llorar
Porque hoy ya te perdí
Queriéndote olvidar
Me acuerdo más
De ti
Ahh!
Inside.
Come on.
Sit over there!
Ah!
If I can get a proper drink...
Oh! Hup!
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.
Hey, come over, baby. Come on.
Yeah.
- Ahh!
- I'll give you another tattoo, baby!
Where is his girl?
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.
Ah!
