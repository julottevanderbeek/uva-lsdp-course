Oh, thankyou.
They'reprettypeaches.
- Yes, ma'am.
- So, how you been ?
I'm pretty good,
I reckon.
You had any health problems
since I saw you last ?
- Ma'am ?
- Have you been sick ?
Well, back's been
hurtin' a little.
No, no, it's not your back.
Have you been
bleeding somewhere ?
Well--
- Yes, ma'am, a little.
- Yeah.
- Have you been to a doctor ?
- Oh, I--
I don't much like
going to no doctors.
Well, I think
maybe you should go.
No, it's not
a venereal disease.
I just think it's some kind of
kidney or some bladder infection.
But it's been around
for a while.
Could lead to some
more serious problems.
Do you want me
to call a doctor foryou ?
- All right.
- Okay.
You kidsget on to bednow.
It'snearIy 9.:00.
Ah, Mama, can I stay up
just a little bit ?
No.
You heard me, mister.
- Mama ?
- Hmm ?
What does ''fuck'' mean ?
It's a bad word, hon,
for something nice.
But what does it mean ?
Well, it means making love.
It's how your daddy and me
made your brothers and you.
Take his turtles off, hon.
- Mike, did you hear me ?
- What ?
I said get to bed.
Oh, Mike, your lip's
dragging the floor.
- It's gonna freeze like that.
- You act Iike I'm a kid.
You are a kid, honey.
VaIerie, you mayas weII
takeyourgIasses off.
-Iknowhe'sbeen hittingyou again.
-
- I see your lip.
- Oh, no.
Oh, it--
itjust embarrasses me.
It's okay.
Come on.
Hegot worse.
I went to the store yesterday
'cause we's out ofsome things.
And he got home from work early,
before I could get back.
He was waiting with a razor strap.
My legs are all cut up.
And I got welts the size of
footballs on my back and my legs.
I feel guilty, you payin' me money
to tell you to get away from him.
You got to get help.
- Legal help.
- You don't know Donnie Barksdale.
He'll kill me if I leave him.
He'll fiind me.
He said he would.
No, he's not crazy enough
to kill anybody.
He'sjust
an insecure redneck.
What ?
Um,
I think he's got
a woman on the side.
Yeah, he's been
laying out at night.
Excuse me,
but the school's on the phone.
Theysay Mike's
in some kindoftroubIe.
Mrs. Wilson.
Hi. Come on in.
Have a seat.
- Uh, where-- where's Mike ?
- He's in the infiirmary.
Now, it's nothing to get
worked up about. He's fiine.
He's got a few, um--
Sit down.
He's got a few,
uh, nicks and bruises.
I think he might have a-- have
a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.
But he's, uh--
he's okay.
- He was in another fiight ?
- Yes, he was.
His grades are, uh-- are getting
worse too. How's he doing at home ?
Um, not much better.
He's real distant.
Mm-hmm.
Well, Mrs. Wilson,
I don't pretend to be
a psychologist, but, um,
it's obvious to me that your boy's
got a lot ofanger in him.
Well, um, it's about this time
last year his daddy passed away.
He's still real
messed up over it.
Yeah. I never knew your husband.
I understand he was a fiine man.
Yes, he was.
Well, I don't know how you
feel about therapy, but, uh--
Ifyou think Mike needs somebody to
talk to, I know a gentleman over--
Mike doesn't need a therapist,
Mr. Collins. He can talk to me.
Do you think he will, though ?
I'm sorry, Wayne. Ididn 't know
you hadanybody in here.
- Oh, hi. Um--
- Ruby wasn't at her desk.
Yeah, she's out sick today. Uh,
Mrs. Wilson, this isJessica King,

- Nice to meet you.
You too.
We'rejust going to be
a couple of minutes. Okay.
Uh, I gotta go anyway.
I got people waiting.
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Collins.

He'sjust a boy,
that's all.
You're not that Wilson that's

Buddy.
Oh, my God !

Okay. Well, thankyou.
'Cause ifyou had said ''yes,''

I'm Donnie Barksdale.
I'm sorry to botheryou so late, but
I believe you know my wife Valerie.
Yes, I do.
I know who you are.

It's about my wife.
Something's happened to her.
What's happened ?
She okay ?
Well, no, she's not, ma'am.
Ma 'am, Ipromise.

You ain't no better

Do you know
what this is ?
It's a voodoo doll.
I'm going to use this voodoo doll
on you, some ofyour own medicine.
Ifyou don't stop

I'm stickin' me a pin

Go back to bed.
Everything's fine.
I bet you love those

And I bet they need

Don't you threaten me or my kids.
Now, what I do here is my business.
Ifyour wife has any sense,
she'll leave you so far behind,
you'll never fiind her.
Now you get out of here

All right, I'll read foryou. But

Don't you understand ?
Hon, he's gonna keep hurting you

No, thankyou.
Come on. I asked you to dance,

We're a little different

Oh.
I'm used to tennis shoes.
This kind of reminds me
when I was a kid.
I'd sit out on that porch.
I'd have so many thoughts,
just couldn't count 'em.
How'd you
wind up in Brixton ?
My husband. He got a job here
at the cable plant.
Right.
What ?

he'd just
take it away from me.
Did he take other things
away from you ?
Buddy--

My daddy's a good man.
I don't hate my dad.
He's good to Mama and me.

Well, we went out there
just last month on his birthday.
Honey, I'm real busy,

Well, it seems like you have time
for a lot ofstrangers.
Ifwe're talking about my

They're the ones

But howcome we don't

Y'all both just

So I'm afraid she might have been
kidnapped or something ?
Oh, Mr. King,
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about
your daughter's disappearance.
I think
we werejust hoping--
Is there anything
you can tell us ?
I could read foryou.
But that-- that's
about all I could do.
I need you
to cut the cards for me.
Oh, boy.
Thankyou.
All right.
You ready ?
Okay.
When were you
getting married again, Wayne ?
-June 20--
- We're supposed to ask questions,

Look, I have a hard time
concentrating...
with more than one person
in the room.
Well, I'm staying right here. I'm
the law, and I need to hear this.
Please, ma'am, just--
just try to tell us
what you see.
just try to tell us
what you see.
I'm trying.
All right.
All right,

it's like a--
it's a fence.
Like a split rail fence.
Do you know how many fences
there are in this county ?
And some pillars, like,
with an opening going through.
And there's lots ofwhite flowers.
I can-- I--
Y-Yes. And, uh,
is that whereJessie is ?
Oh.
Well, that's-- that's, um, all I'm--
all I'm seeing.
This isjust mishmash. I told you
this wouldn't lead to nothing.
You're right. It won't.
I can't concentrate.
- I can't do this now. I'm sorry.
- Please, ma'am.
I really do hope
you fiind your daughter.
But I'm-- I'm just not the person
to help you with this.

- Idon't know. Ijust thought--
- Dave ?
Yes, sir ?
IcouIdhavesworn there
wasan ecIairin there.
- I didn't get it.
- Uh-huh.
Tim was in
a little earlier.
So you saw all this
in a dream ?
It wasn'tjust a dream.
I don't investigate
somebody's dream.
I think she's dead, Sheriff.
And I think she's in a pond.
What do you know about this
you ain't telling me ?
Hmm ? You canget in serious
troubIe withhoIding information.
Does it sound like
a place you know ?
Yeah,
a bunch of places I know.
Split rail fence, a pond,
a stretch ofwoods.
- Every rawbone ol' boy got that.
- What about the fiiddler ?
Well,
ol' Tommy Lee Ballard
plays a fiiddle.
But he wouldn't kill nobody.
I've known him since he's a kid.
No, no, it's not the fiiddler.
Who are his neighbors ?
Well, his closest neighbor
would be, uh--
Well, let me see here.
I guess--
Well, his property borders,
uh, Donnie Barksdale's place.
Doyou know
Donnie BarksdaIe ?
Ma 'am ?
Tim ! On the gate !
You didget
a search warrant, didn 'tyou ?
I want everything
to be IegaIandproper.
Didn't have to.
Got permission from the owner.
Donnie BarksdaIe

His wife did.
I told her it was routine.
We're checking all the ponds
in the county.
Donnie'sgone fishing today.
Excuse me. SheriffJohnson ?

- Long as it takes.
All right. You just said you're

And we're

Hey, Pearl !
I think I got something !
False alarm.
It'sjust an old bicycle.
None ofy'all brought a Thermos
ofcoffee out here ?
That day at school.
You looked kind ofstrange
at me and Jessica.
Did you think
something bad then ?
Shit.
Come on.
- Donnie, he called. I told him--
- Pearl !
Shut your mouth !
Goddamn it, Pearl,
what are you doing on my property ?
I'm on Sheriff's business, Donnie.
I got permission from your wife.
You think I let that
little ninny talk for me ?
How'd your arm
get all scratched up ?
Stray cat. She didn't like it
when I killed her.
- Now what brought you here ?
-Just routine investigation.
We're checking
all the ponds in the county.
- Iknewit wasyou.
- No ! You-- Uhh !
Hey ! I'm on County business,
Donnie. Don't fool with me.

- Donnie ?
Get those hooks

- Get her offthem hooks ! Ohh !
- Cuff him !
- No ! No !
- Mr. King !

I think he's
having a heart attack !
- I didn't do this !
- Get him out of here !
This ain't right !
Pearl !
Bitch !
Bitch ! Bitch ! Pearl !
Come in.
Somebody might
come in here.
I guess you better
fuck me fast.
You want some coffee ?
Mrs. Wilson ?
You want some coffee ?
No, thankyou.
Have a seat.
Why-- Why have you
called me here ?
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale goes
on trial for murder...
and I feel
that we have a powerful case.
In fact,
today the coroner verifiied...
Donnie's tissue
under the victim's fiingernails.
Now, I only have one weak link
I got to worry about.
- What ?
- You.
Yousee, you're how we foundout
where the victim 'sbody was.
And how you found out,
well,
that might open up
a real can ofworms for us.
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.
The defense
couIdgo to town onyou.
Andifthat'snot badenough,
Iunderstandthere wasbadbIood...
between you
and Donnie Barksdale.
Yeah.
He threatened my kids.
That's what Iheard. IaIso heard
thatyou threatenedhim right back.
ToIdhis wife
to Ieave him.
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.
Wereyou invoIved
with him ?
- What ?
- Ican deaI with any reveIation...
right now.
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...
orDonnie's wife
orthe victim ?
No.
Will that be all ?
Yes, ma'am.
You know, Mr. Duncan,
the victim had a name.
It wasJessica King.
Mr. Hawkins, howIonghaveyou

Mr. Hawkins, howIonghaveyou

About ten years.
Now, were you working at AyJay's
on Saturday night, April 8 ?
- Yes, sir.

-Yes, sir.
Could you describe the circumstances

Shescratchedhisarm
andhesIappedthe tarout ofher.
About that time,
Igo backinside.
Is this the woman
you saw with Donnie Barksdale ?
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...
that I'vejust shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph ofJessica King.
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.
Drawn in--
Well, drawn in what way ?
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...
went to see a woman,
name ofAnnie Wilson.
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you ?
Well, word around town
was that she was a,
uh--
- WeII, Idon't knowthe right word.
- Isn't it fortune-teller ?
-Iguessso.
-What didthis fortune-teIIersee...
when she looked into
her little crystal ball ?
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, uh, special cards.
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards ?
Uh, she didn't actually
see nothing then.
But next day,
she come to see me and...
told me
she had this dream.
- She had a dream ?
- Yes, sir.
She'd seen this pond and it looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...
then she woke up
from herdream...
andshe went outside
andIookedup in this tree.
I'm all ears.
She seenJessica King...
floatin' in the tree,
half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.
Floatin' around a tree ?
Yes, sir.
Floatin' in a tree,
haIf-naked,
with a chain
wrapped around her.
Thankyou, Sheriff.
That little squirrel,
Weems, isjust mean and skinny.
Neverhave known
a Weems worth a damn.
Well, he was
just doing hisjob.
Uh, Mrs. Wilson ?
Can I talk to you for a minute ?
- Um--
- Uh, just call me later on, okay ?
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, bye.
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay ?
Um, Mrs. Wilson ?
You did tell me to do some thinkin'
and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.
What ? What ?
Can you tell me why
I do things to myself...
when I think
about my daddy ?
All right, well--
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right ?
- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.
- Touching yourself? How ?
- Why do I do that ?
It's not a good time.
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy--
And I-- I keep thinking
about that blue diamond.
You look into the blue diamond,
you won't think a negative thought.
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself. I'm--
I just-- I can't talk
to you now, okay ?
You'regonna burn
in heII, Annie WiIson !
Now, Mike, Iknowyouskipped
schooIand went to that triaI.
- How'd you know ?
- A little bird told me.
It's time you started making things
easier on me instead of harder.
-
- I'm very disappointed in you.
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- Second ofall,
I'm gonna have to testify
at that trial tomorrow.
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- I'm not deaf, Miller.
Let the machine get it.
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're
gonna try and give me a hard time.
They're gonna call me names
and I--
I just want y'all
to be prepared...
ifyou hear any bad stuff
about me, all right ?
Now, we're all gonna have to
be sticking together on this one.
Annie WiIson, it'sBuddy'smother.
Buddy's donegone crazy.
He's threatening to kiIIhis daddy!
He's got Odell tied up
in the backyard,
accusing him
of horrible things.
- Have you called the police ?
- He said if I did he'd kill Odell.
He wants you.
Hey, Buddy.
Buddy, put that strap down and
tell me what he's done to you.
I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,
you can talk to me, honey.
It's too late for that !
It's too goddamn late !
Thishere isa criminaI.
And he's gonna be punished.
Bud-Buddy.
Buddy, it's Annie.
- You shut up ! You shut up !
- It's all right.
- Get away ! Where were you ?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You knew everything
and you did nothing.
You ruined me.
You ruined me !
I wasjust a little boy, Daddy.
It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy.
How could you do that
to your little boy ?
No, Buddy. You put that down.
No, Buddy.
You put that down, Buddy.
You put that down. You listen to me.
You get away !
You get away ! Get away !
All right, Buddy. All right.
It's all right. Come on.
Why-- Why didn't
you help me, Annie ?
What ?
Why didn't you
help me ?
- I had you for a friend and then--
- I am your friend, Buddy.
Now I have nobody.
I have nobody !
But I'm gonna--
I'm gonna kill this thing.
- No !
- No, Buddy !
No !
Help me !
- HeIp me!
- Look at that goddamn thing.
Andyou teIIme what kind
ofthoughtsyou have ?
You Iook!
You Iook
into that thing !
Mrs. WiIson ? Mrs. WiIson.
Mrs. Wilson, your husband,
Ben Wilson Senior,
was one ofthe men killed last year
in the explosion...
out at the Reinhold
Cable Plant.
Yes, that's right.
Andyou were Ieft with threesmaII
chiIdren to raise onyourown.
Yes, sir.
How do you provide
foryou and your sons ?
I get a little bit
of money from Social Security...
as a result
of my husband's death.
And, uh,
I also give readings.
- Psychic readings.
- Yes, sir.
What doesbeingpsychic
enabIeyou to do ?
I see things...
and I, you know--
I sense... things...
that-- well, they
hadn't happened yet...
orthey were happening
somepIace eIse.
My granny told me that I--
I had a gift that runs in my family.
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd-- I'd be all right.
So, you'reswearing
before this court...
that you didn't get your information
about this tragedy...
from any other means
than your special ability ?
- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.
I'm swearing that. Yes.
- Thankyou, Mrs. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.
- I have no further questions.
- Mr. Weems.
Mrs. WiIson.
How many fiingers am I holding up
behind my back ?
- Objection, Your Honor.
- YourHonor,
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...
partIybecause ofpowers
that this woman cIaims to have.
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...
to test
the alleged powers...
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.
Can everyone in thejury box
see how many fiingers I'm showing ?
How many fiingers,
Mrs. Wilson ?
I don't know.
You don't know ?
Seven.
Seven fingers.
That-- That doesn't
prove anything.
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop ofa hat.
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop ofa dollar bill ?
What are you trying to say ?
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift ofyours doesn't work...
unless you're
being paid for it.
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''
No, that's not true.
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money ?
Well, I don't charge money.
You just testifiied
that you do charge money.
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.
Oh. A distinction
worthy ofa lawyer.
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman ?
- No.
- Why not ?
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be fiilthy rich.
I'dbepIaying
theStockMarket.
I'dbe overin MobiIe
betting on the dogs.
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.
Except for those, uh,
what you call 'em, donations ?
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you ?
Yes, I have.
Just a few weeks ago, you told him--
I believe the exact words was...
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings ofyours,
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,
that Donnie wasjust
an insecure redneck...
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody ?
Yes, I did say that.
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody ?
Wait a second.
I've never said that.
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.
-He's on trial for his life.
-I just told the sheriffwhat I saw.
And how could any of us
ever forget that ?
Jessica Kingjust
floatin' up in that tree,
naked,
with a chain...
wrappedaroundher.
It must be
so much fun foryou.
You must be having
the time ofyour life...
entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir ?
You think that's fun ?
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep ?
NowI'm sittinghere
andI'm bIaming myseIf...
'cause some poor crazy man tried
to burn his daddy halfto death.
And you think I'm sitting here
having fun ?
I'm sorry, sir.
You're crazy ifyou think that.
No more questions,
Your Honor.
You're dismissed.
Like theysay in HoIIywood,
Iet'sjust cut to the chase.
Did you or did you not
kill Jessica King ?
I did not.
Did you or did you not seeJessica
King on the night she was killed ?
Yeah, I seen her.
Would you describe
the circumstances, please ?
Well, I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.
WouIdyou cIarify what
you mean by ''seeing'' ?
I mean, her and me
had been having sex.
Okay, go ahead.
WeII, she caIIedme
about 1 1.:00.
So I told her
I'd meet her out at AyJay's.
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.
- What happened after that ?
- Well, we got in an argument.
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.
-Did she tell you why ?
-She said she was getting married...
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.
At Ieast
tiIIafterthe wedding.
Andduring the course
ofthisargument with Miss King,
did you at any moment
strike her ?
Yes, sir.
What happened
afteryou struck her ?
WeII, she bangedherhead
prettyhard when she went down,
so I-- Idecided
to take herto the hospitaI.
- Did you reach the hospital ?
- No, sir.
Are you feeling okay ?
I'm fiine.
I wanna go back.
I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone--
Someone might see me.
Shesaidshe wasfeeIingbetter,
so Itookherback toAyJay's.
Idroppedheroff,
then I went on backhome.
Andthat was the veryIast time
thatyousawJessica KingaIive ?
- Yes, sir. The very last.
- Donnie,
are you guilty
ofthe charge against you ?
I'm guilty
ofcheating on my wife,
ofbeinga badhusband,
a badChristian.
But I ain't guilty
of killingJesse.
I swear to God.
No more questions,
Your Honor.
Mr. Duncan.
Mr. Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you ?
I've swore to tell
the truth here today.
Yeah, I've hit
VaIerie before.
I guess
it ain't no secret.
So, you admit to havinga history
ofvioIence against women ?
You also admit to having
beaten up the victim...
on the night
that she was murdered.
I wouldn't exactly say
that I beat her up.
You're the expert. You teIIme.
Just howbadIy doyou...
have to beat a woman before it fiits
your defiinition of ''beating up'' ?
Now, yourstoryis thatyou've
been havingan affair...
with the victim.
But tell us why a beautiful
young woman likeJessica King...
from one ofthe fiinest
families in Brixton,
just about to be married to a good,
decent professional man...
and with a bright,
shining future in front ofher--
Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you ?
I asked her that
myselfone time.
She said I was the only man
in town who knew how to fuck.
You're really disgusting.
You know that ?
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.
Mr. Duncan, you will refrain from
making those personal comments.
I apologize, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.
So, let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.
You're saying it was
just a coincidence...
that on the very same night that you
physically assaulted Jessica King,
someone else put
her body in your pond ?
I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.
- What are you saying ?
- I'm saying I got framed !
Oh, well, what an original defense.
Did you think ofJessica King
as a stray cat ?
No.
Did you tell SheriffJohnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm ?
- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...
-Jessica had scratched your arm ?
- Yeah, but--
Didn't you tell SheriffJohnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...
because she didn't like it
when you killed her ?
Yeah, but I was lying.
My wife was standing right there !
-How do I know you're not lying now?
-Because I'm not, goddamn it !
- It's her, goddamn it !
- Be seated, Mr. Barksdale !
She's the reason I'm up here !
She'sagoddamn witch !
She'sputting speIIs on
every-goddamn-body in town !
Witch ! Witch !
Yeah, you run !
I'IIhave orderin the courtroom.
In Brixton today, a sensationaI
murdertriaI was concIuded.
DonaIdJ. BarksdaIe
wasfoundguiIty...
in thesexandstranguIation
kiIIing ofJessica King,
daughteroftheprominent Brixton
businessman, Kenneth King.
Is everything gonna be
all right now, Mama ?
Yeah, hon.
We can get on
with our lives now.
I guess I'm the last
person you wanna see.
How you been ?
Terrible.
Annie, ifyou tell me to get going,
I will. I wouldn't blame you.
But I need you
to read for me.
Give me a hand.
I feel like I can't
hold on any longer.
I know Donnie's mean and everything,
but I feel real lost without him.
You know, I ain't never
been on my own before.
And I'm-I'm scared, Annie.
You don't need to be scared, hon.
You'll be fiine.
You see that
in the cards ?
Mm-hmm.
Right through here.
But can you see
what-- what I'm thinking ?
Can you see that
in the cards ?
What do you mean ?
Well,
I've been thinking
some real bad, bad thoughts.
Unchristian thoughts.
Like what ?
Like--
I'm glad that girl's dead.
Jessica.
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.
No one deserves that.
Like I said,
I know it's unchristian.
What ? What, areyou
seeingsomethingbad?
I don't know.
It's not clear.
- Fuckyou !
-
Wayne ?
Wayne ?
It's not normally
like this.
You need
to lie down.
I'm really not sleepy.
I think ifyou sleep,
you'll feel better.
Thankyou, Annie.
Oh. It's okay.
Wayne.
I don't think
this is a good idea.
No.
It's not.
I just thought we could
forget all this for a while.
You want to,
don'tyou ?
I know there's
something between us.
I can't.
I guess
I still feel married.
You're not, though.
- He's gone.
- I know.
You gotta learn
to deal with that.
The same way I gotta learn to deal
with the fact thatJessica's gone.
She's dead.
Oh, Wayne,
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
I-- I don't think
Donnie Barksdale killed her.
- No, no, Annie.
- I'm really sorry.
I can't-- I can't do this.
It's fiinished.
I know. I wanna let
that bastard rot in jail.
- But he's guilty.
- No, Wayne.
I see it.
I see he didn't do it.
- Do you see who did ?
- Uh, I'm trying, but I-- I--
I don't know yet.
What are we gonna do ?
Well, if I had
a piece ofclothing...
or maybe I could go
out to the pond or see if I--
It's not over.
Jesus.
Come on in.
Well,
what brings you out here ?
Well, I'll just come
straight out and say it.
I don't think Donnie Barksdale
killed Jessica King.
Well, sure he did.
It was an open-and-shut case.
I'm telling you he didn't.
The person that killed Jessica
is still out there someplace.
What's the deal ? The Barksdales
been threatening you ?
- No.
- I'll talk to Pearl Johnson.
This has nothing to do
with the Barksdales. Listen.
I know that Donnie
didn't kill Jessica...
the same way that I knew
that her body was in his pond.
And do you know
who did kill her ?
No.
So, what do you care ?
The son ofa bitch is in jail.
I got a warning today.
I think somebody is
gonna try and kill me.
What do you
want me to do ?
Reopen the case and fiind out
who really did it.
- I can't. He's been convicted.
- Well, you can talk to somebody.
I've got no basis to open this case.
I'd look like a fool.
I don't give a damn
how you look.
Now, you listen to me.
I know you had
an affair withJessica.
So how do you thinkyou're
gonna look if people fiind out...
you had sex with the victim
the night before she was killed ?
Do you want money ?
No. I want you
to reopen the case.
There's a saying about
letting sleeping dogs lie.
You thinkyou're in danger now ?
Look at it logically.
The real danger begins ifthis case
gets reopened and someone starts...
worrying that you're gonna have
another one ofyour damn dreams.
All I know is,
the wrong man's in jail.
I don't care how awful he is.
And I helped put him there.
I can't live
with something like that.
So you fiind a way
to reopen this case, sir.
Or I will.
Buddy !
Buddy, I'm here ifyou--
-  Hello.
- Hi, Miss Francis. I'm back.
- Good.
- How are the boys ?
They're fiine. They went to sleep.
You want me to bring 'em over ?
No. No. Listen.
Could we stay over
your house tonight ?
- Sure you can. You all right ?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fiine.
-
-Come over. I'll make a bed foryou.
- All right. I'm just gonna lock up.
- Okay, doll.
- Okay, thankyou.
- Bye-bye.
Buddy !
Oh ! Did you see
Buddy Cole ?
Buddy ? No. I thought he was
at the hospital over in Benton ?
- Oh, he is. Maybe I imagined it.
- Are you okay ?
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.
Ever since you told me what you told
me, I feel like I'm going crazy.
Annie, I can't stand
another night ofthis.
I need you
to read for me.
It's no good.
- Try it again.
- I can't make it happen.
How about
what you said today ?
What ?
Thepond.
What ifwe did
go back out there ?
Do you think
it might help you ?
I-- I--
I don't know.
Yeah. Uh, maybe.
Yeah, okay. Well,
it's worth a try, right ?
You mean tonight ? No, Wayne.
I can't-- I can't do that.
I got my kids. It's dark.
You know, it's, uh-- it is a pol--
it's a police matter now.
HowIong doyou think
that'sgonna take, Annie ?
It's gonna sit on somebody's desk
for months. Nothing's gonna happen.
It's over for them. They've got
their man. It's up to us.
I know that, Wayne. But I'm
telling you, I don't see anything.
I can't keep running
from things.
Maybe ifyou just
sort ofwalk around.
All right.
Oh, shoot !
Jeez, you all right ?
You okay ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you
doing here ?
Youseeingsomething ?
I've been thinking
some reaIbad, badthoughts.
Annie ?

Maybe I wanted to be
with a man for a change.
- Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth. Fuckyou !

I don't like being spied on.
The only reason I'm with you

You horrible little bitch !
I'll show you a bitch ifyou
don't let go of me. Let go !
- I think we better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you ?
No.
Nothing.
You know.
I knew if I got you close enough
to it that you'd see it.
- Wayne, I told you--
- No, no. It's okay.
I swear to God, Annie,
it's okay. It's okay.
I wanted you to.
I swear to God.
I wanted you to see it so bad.
I mean, that's why we're here.
I'm not some killer, Annie.
I'm not.
You don't-- I mean, do you know
what it was like with her ?
She was so fucking hurtful
and spiteful and all of it--
Wayne, I'm not gonna--
But all of itjust happened

none ofthis would have happened.

I-I-I won't--
I won't tell anybody.
No, Annie--
You all right, Mrs. Wilson ?

You know you're
gonna have to go back.
Yes, ma'am, I know.

WeII,
I just talked to Wayne.
He pretty much admitted
to everything.
I've known that boy
half my life.
Itjust goes to show,
you can know somebody and...
not know 'em.
How's his, um--
How's his head ?
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.
Oh, no, Sheriff,

It was, um--
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

- Well, yes, it was.
- Why don't you just ask Wayne ?
- I did.
He don't remember
what happened.
