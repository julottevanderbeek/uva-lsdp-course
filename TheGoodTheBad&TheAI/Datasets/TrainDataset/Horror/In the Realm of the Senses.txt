IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES
Awake already?
It's so cold. It's too early
to get up.
- Let's sleep a little longer.
- I can't sleep.
I can't go to sleep
so early.
That's natural.
When I began working here,
I had the same problem.
You're so attractive. Far too
lovely for a place like this.
Yesterday, when I first saw you,
I knew we'd get along.
kiss me, Sada.
No, your hands are too cold.
I love stroking your skin;
it's so smooth.
Sada, don't you like it
when I caress you?
Listen...
Each morning is just like this.
Afterward, he goes to market.
Let's play a game.
You first.
Lucky in love.
Love is blind!
- Blind man's bluff!
- Bluff at love!
Love's a bluff!
What are you children up to?
What are you doing?
Stop! Leave the poor man alone!
You heard what she said.
Leave him alone!
- Oh! It's horrible!
- Horrible!
Get away,
you filthy little tramps!
Get out of here!
I said out!
No, wait! I know you!
Let go of me!
I don't know you!
Don't touch her!
keep your filthy hands off her!
Just wait a second.
I know I've seen you.
It was in Osaka or Nagoya...
Tokyo!
It's you, all right!
You were the nicest one there.
I used to be one of
your best customers.
You must remember me!
How can I remember someone
I've never laid eyes on?
I want you!
I want you now!
Look. I have money.
I can pay you!
Please, just this once.
Once, that's all.
I beg of you!
You've been waiting
all day?
God bless you!
You're still the nicest one.
Sit down.
Did you mean it, saying you'd
never seen me before?
But I never have.
What now? How can I do
anything with that?
Are you cold?
No, no, it would be easier
if I could see your...
I doubt it, but we can try.
You'll catch cold.
You'd better put it away
before it freezes.
Poor old thing.
Stop wasting time!
Hurry up now!
Where have you been?
Here. Take this tray in
immediately!
Better change your ways.
We have a reputation to uphold.
Don't look at me that way!
Stop it! Stop!
Stop!
Now stop this immediately!
What have you against her?
She's nothing but a whore,
a common whore...
and that's all
she'll ever be!
Let me go!
I'll kill her!
- I said stop it!
- You bitch!
What do you have against whores?
Who do you think you are?
Enough!
You too!
I've had enough! You're both
to blame! Get back to work!
- Filthy whore!
- Let me go!
What's going on here?
You're behaving
like children.
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new here? Answer me.
What's your name?
Sada.
Abe Sada.
This wouldn't occur if you were
here to help now and then.
Give me the knife.
What beautiful hands you have.
Why use them for violence...
when you could use them
for other things.
That's a lovely sight!
No, don't stop.
Go on working.
If you fear getting burned, girl
don't play with fire
I like the sway
of your hips.
A girl like you can stab a man's
heart without a knife, huh?
Little girl, there's a fire...
How many hearts have you broken?
Tell me.
What are you doing, Master?
You like it, don't you.
I know you do.
But listen, Master.
I have a man in my life
who gets very jealous.
I know all about your man.
Your gigolo's bankrupt.
- You work here to pay his debts.
- Yes.
Life is hard.
Besides, you aren't
that virtuous, are you?
I was told this house has
a respectable reputation.
Of course, you're right.
A respectable house
with a respectable master.
Haven't you finished yet?
Hurry!
Good evening, Master.
Are you alone tonight?
I'm not allowed
to go out at night...
and so the master becomes
the client.
Why aren't you allowed
out at night?
There are too many temptations.
Mistress told me
to serve a customer.
- I had no idea it was you.
- Now you know.
This path is filled
with hidden treasure
Ieading man
to eternal pleasure
What's the matter? Are you
ashamed of your desire?
Life is made for pleasure.
Come, Sada.
I love it.
If you go on, l--
The geisha will be here soon.
I can't stand it.
- You want me to stop?
- Yes, yes.
It's driving me mad.
Mad? Why?
Tell me why.
I feel reborn.
Good evening. I'm the geisha
you invited.
- May I come in?
- In a moment.
- I'm busy right now. Just wait.
- I'm in no hurry, sir.
Okay, you can come in now.
- Now I'm here.
- Yes.
Good evening to you.
A lovely young girl!
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.
Well, go.
But I can wait...
if you wish.
I've heard it's better
if you wait a little.
Slowly. There's no hurry.
Last night, l...
I came too soon for you!
Think of yourself.
I want to feel your pleasure.
Don't think of me.
I want you to feel free.
It's for you that I hold back.
I can't stop. I--
Now you'll start over again
with your wife, won't you?
How can you make love to her
at the same hour each day?
So you've seen us?
You were watching, huh?
Yes. I won't let you return to her
until I've satisfied you.
You torture yourself
for nothing.
We have plenty of time.
All the time in the world.
We haven't. Master,
it will be sunrise soon.
I said not to worry
about me.
You're an extraordinary woman.
I can't go on.
Let me stop playing.
You must go on
in place of the geisha.
I didn't invite her so you and l
could be alone tonight.
But you must keep playing
and singing...
or my wife
will become suspicious.
- Why don't you sing instead?
- You sing a bit longer.
Excuse me, Mistress.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Come in.
I'm grateful for your kindness,
but feel unworthy of your trust.
I'd like permission
to leave here.
There's no problem of trust.
That's silly.
Go get me some water instead,
okay?
Yes.
I want you to stay.
I am quite satisfied with you.
You seem like
a very serious girl.
I really wonder why you should
go away and leave us.
- Oh, God.
- What?
My period just started.
It doesn't matter.
Hello. Anyone home?
You're going to see me naked
for the first time.
- Are you shy?
- A little, yes.
You undress first.
Wait. Let me.
I want to undress you.
How young and beautiful
you are!
I love the texture of your skin.
So smooth, like velvet.
You devour men.
Are you reproaching me
for wanting you too much?
You know, I'm no longer young.
I envy your youth.
I love to caress your body.
I feel like biting you all over.
Sorry, may I bring in
the sake?
I was afraid you wouldn't be able
to go into town tonight.
I haven't gone into town.
This is our home.
Just yours and mine.
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever heard.
We wish you joy
and happiness.
Now what am l
supposed to do?
You mustn't ask me.
Aren't you the bride?
How should I know? I've never
been married before.
True enough. If my young bride
had already been married...
then I'd be missing something
tonight!
All this said, let's celebrate
this great event together.
Rejoice with us on the happiest
day of our lives.
The time has come to celebrate
your first night together.
Nervous?
- It's a great moment.
- It is!
What if the bride and groom
aren't exactly strangers?
Nothing changes.
While she's not a virgin,
she saved her virginity for you...
and pleasure comes
with experience.
Really?
Really?
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Master, I'm ready now.
Don't call me "Master." From now on,
call me kichi-san, okay?
Thank you... kichi-san.
Sada.
What is it?
You're trembling.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I'm shaking all over.
Let's begin.
- You look very interested.
- Get closer!
- You'll get a better view.
- It's the only way to learn.
Come on. There's nothing
to be afraid of.
No, no, leave me alone!
- Go on!
- You should know more about men.
Look well!
keep your eyes open.
Don't close them. Look!
It won't hurt for long!
The pain is so great, I can't
bear it. It's too agonizing!
kosome, it's your turn now!
Can I make the bed?
- He's not awake yet. Do it later.
- Okay.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 12:00.
It's noon already.
kichi-san, it's noon.
Wake up.
Morning.
Did you hold it all night,
or was it a dream?
It wasn't a dream.
You mean you didn't
sleep at all?
I spent the night looking at you.
I couldn't stop.
You're wonderful.
You're so young.
How can you look so lovely
and fresh without sleep?
Makes me jealous!
Are you in that big of a hurry?
Give me a minute, okay?
- I want you now.
- I've got to pee. Okay with you?
There's no need to leave.
Do it here.
Where?
Inside of Sada,
all nice and warm.
You're mad! It's impossible
to do both at the same time.
We can try and see
what happens.
Can't you wait one minute?
I can't. I'm tired of waiting.
I want you now.
You're insatiable!
You want to make love
all the time, huh?
You don't think it's wrong,
do you?
I think it's wonderful.
You're beautiful.
I was afraid of not
being like others.
I was so worried about it,
I even went to see a doctor.
He said I was sensitive
where sex was concerned.
Sensitive?
I hope it's incurable.
Because I adore
your oversensitivity.
Take me now!
I want you now.
I can't wait any longer.
Slowly.
No, I can't wait!
Why so cheerful?
I was thinking that the only way
my penis can rest...
is when it must go and pee,
isn't that so?
That's right.
I know one thing.
It doesn't take you long,
once you've finished, to start again.
You see? It's just as I said.
You make it so obedient
to your touch.
I often wonder
whose it is.
It's all mine!
Why does it become so hard
suddenly?
Do you know why?
That's because...
because it wants you more than
anything in the world.
Please. I can wait no longer!
- We can be seen here.
- Let them watch. I don't care.
Well, grandmother,
working hard, huh?
Yes. It keeps
an old woman busy!
We'd better part here.
Not yet. Let's separate
just before you reach home.
Leave it alone.
Don't you realize it's tired?
My servants will see us.
Let go of me, please.
How can l?
It's so nice and hard.
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.
On one condition. That you
take me now, right here!
- Pardon me. I have your sake.
- Come in.
You're not in bed together
for once? That's unusual.
I had to bring the sake.
The servants won't come in here.
Why's that?
- You're always in the middle of--
- Of what?
Taking it in my mouth
and sucking it.
I'd appreciate it
if you'd care for kichi.
I must leave,
but I'll return tomorrow.
Watch him closely.
He's to stay here. He's not
allowed to go out, understand?
I'll do what I can.
What about the geishas?
- They can come if he wants them.
- Really?
Do I look elegant?
You look lovelier every day.
Not again!
You make me feel things
I've never felt.
Scandalous!
I know we need the money...
but when I think of you
with someone else, I get jealous.
Jealous? If you really
get jealous, that's wonderful.
Tomorrow it'll be over.
He's a school director
and an alderman.
Very intellectual.
- You like intellectuals, huh?
- I do. They're so generous!
kichi-san, I've decided to wear
your kimono while I'm gone.
Why?
To insure you don't return
to your house.
You want me to stay naked
while you're away?
I'll lend you mine.
- Here. Try it on.
- If you insist.
Well?
May I pour you some sake?
Don't you want some, sir?
You must eat something.
It's important.
The two of you are impossible.
You never eat.
Listen, sir. Leave now.
Don't wait for her to return.
Go before it's too late!
If you stay, that woman
will end up killing you.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Master, you seem tired
this afternoon.
You know that you needn't
sleep with me.
When you haven't wanted to,
I've understood.
It isn't easy for me.
I can't spend my nights alone
waiting for you.
There's no need for that.
Why don't you sleep alone?
You promised to try, didn't you?
You swore you'd try.
It's different with you...
because I'm very fond of you
and I respect you.
Do you understand, Master?
I want you to beat me now!
- Slap me hard!
- Sada!
Beat me hard!
More, and harder!
Pinch me!
Pinch me now!
keep pinching!
Don't stop!
Make it hurt. Go on.
Harder!
Now, pull-- Pull my hair!
Pull it!
More!
Make it hurt!
I want to feel pain!
Please, don't stop!
How have you been?
- I've got money too!
- Really?
Let's go spend it!
I missed you so much.
I'm never going
to leave you again.
- Let me love you this time.
- If you like.
You lead and I'll follow.
Wait and see how good I am.
You promised I could lead.
You look radiant!
You're so alive and happy,
one would think you're 16!
It's good to be home.
I love to watch you
going in and out of me.
I adore it.
I adore it.
Don't move.
What was it like
with your intellectual?
I want to know exactly.
Show me.
No, it tickles.
He found it erotic.
It didn't tickle him!
So, he's a lecherous
school director.
"Listen, Sada, your future
depends on your virtue...
so you'd better change
your ways."
Then, was he virtuous?
Oh, yes. Very.
He was very well-behaved.
What about you?
Please don't be angry.
I suddenly thought of you
and I lost control.
I don't know why...
but I asked him to beat me
as hard as he could.
And your intellectual?
What did he do?
Come on, Sada. Hit me.
Why?
Beat me!
More!
Go on. Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
Even harder!
Don't stop! Harder!
All we do, even eating,
must be an act of love.
I love it.
I'm still hungry. My pleasure
lies in giving you pleasure.
and obeying your every desire.
Wonderful appetizer!
I want an egg now.
You want one?
kichi-san! I want you
to get it out. Come!
Take it out right now!
How can l
if you're sitting down?
Haven't you ever watched
a hen lay an egg?
- Like this?
- That's right.
Now push, that's all.
It'll come out.
There it is.
- You got it.
- Eat it!
Sada, don't.
We're not alone.
I don't care!
I want you now!
- What's that for?
- To cut it off!
Why?
So it won't ever go inside
anyone else!
It's never betrayed you.
I swear.
I don't believe it. You'll use it
to make love to other women.
Cut it off if you want,
but you'll regret it.
No, kichi-san.
Why will I regret it?
That way, I'll have it
inside me forever.
Cut it, then, if you want.
If I cut it off,
do you think you'll die?
Most likely.
I don't want you to die.
Then I won't die.
I promised to be with you
forever, didn't l?
I said I would set you up
in a small inn.
I won't be the "other woman."
I won't share you
with your wife.
You belong to Sada
and to no one else!
Listen. I'll end up a skeleton
if we're always together.
There'll be nothing left
of kichi-san at all!
You don't want me.
Is that what you're saying?
Though reduced to a skeleton,
I'll never leave you.
I won't let you go even if you
are a skeleton, okay?
Could you stop threatening me
with that knife? It's dangerous!
You don't want to grow a beard.
You'll look awful.
Swear you'll never make love
to your wife again.
I swear.
- Repeat: "I'll never do it again."
- I'll never do it again.
Say: "You may kill me
if I ever make love to her."
I allow you to kill me
if I make love to her.
- Shall we scare her?
- Good idea.
I'm a ghost.
- The haunted parasol!
- I've come to haunt you!
Watch out for my spear!
- Why don't you make love to her?
- No! She's not my type!
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.
Look! Like it? It's lovely,
don't you think?
If you serve us a drink,
you can play with it.
I'm not much good anymore.
I only use it to pee.
Let's stay together always!
I caught you! Don't be afraid.
Come. Sit next to me. Come on.
I'm going to catch you!
Don't! It hurts!
Let go of me!
She's hurting me!
Hear that? Do you think
it's a burglar?
No. A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.
It's probably a drunk.
Don't worry. Come back to bed.
I know who it is. That whore
of yours, watching us.
Go to sleep.
Going to see her,
aren't you?
You came in so quietly
you scared me.
Don't worry about it.
Excuse me, Master.
You're wanted on the phone.
Wait.
Good evening.
Good evening, sir.
I warned you!
I warned you!
I want the truth. You made love
to your wife, didn't you?
Stop playing with that knife
as if you wielded a dagger.
You won't kill anyone
with that.
I wanted to buy a sword
to kill you!
Why didn't you go through with it,
if it was your intention?
How? I didn't dare
with everyone staring.
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly!
How would anyone guess why you
wanted a dagger? You're mad!
It's all you think of. It's a
fixation, an obsession. know that?
So you think I'm mad because
I can't stop thinking of you?
Is that what you call
an obsession?
Take off your kimono.
Take it off!
It's hideous.
Take it off.
Are you going to
take it off?
In this position,
it's not easy.
I can't undress alone.
You must help me.
You undress me, would you?
Be honest!
You made love to your wife,
didn't you?
Look at it! There's your answer.
It's been faithful.
- Apologize!
- Why should it apologize?
It has no reason
to apologize.
It knows what it wants!
I'll punish it! You'll see!
Go on. Y es, punish it
as much as you like!
That hurt me!
- Does it hurt?
- It certainly does.
Are you pretending,
or does it hurt?
It really hurts.
Y et you love it
all the same!
It's true.
Say, "Bite harder
and harder!."
Bite harder and harder.
- Say, "Hurt me, Sada."
- Hurt me.
I want to hurt you. I want you
to feel pain, to suffer!
Go on. Punish me!
Hurt me as much as you want,
whenever you want!
Forgive me for having left you
alone these past 3 days. I'm sorry.
I almost went mad!
I can't be without you!
Forgive me.
Sada, you're crying.
You're crying.
- Because I love you.
- Sada, look at me.
It's the first time I've
seen you cry. Look at me.
- I don't want to!
- Look at me!
Your tears are so salty.
I love to taste them.
Hold me closer, kichi-san.
Don't ever leave me again!
Can I bring in the sake?
Come in.
Bring it over here, please.
We're inseparable.
Don't you ever eat anything?
No, no. It makes the body heavy.
It puts you to sleep.
The room must be cleaned
now and then.
Haven't you noticed the smell?
We love the smell in here.
It excites us even more.
Wake up and open your eyes.
You seem to get
even greater pleasure...
when you're strangled
while making love.
You clutched my throat
the other day and...
it felt good.
Did you enjoy it?
Strangle me, right now.
Okay.
Ready? I'm starting.
As I press on your throat,
you'll feel a contraction lower down.
- Am I hurting you?
- No.
Press harder.
Now, what do you feel?
- Don't be afraid. Harder.
- I should stop. You're flushed.
It doesn't matter.
Press harder. Don't worry.
I'll do as you say,
but it'll be painful.
Don't be angry
if I hurt you.
You don't want me to stop?
Answer me.
To reach total pleasure you
must go almost to the end.
- How did it make you feel?
- I didn't like it.
It's because you didn't
press hard enough.
I won't go on. I get no pleasure
from torturing you.
Then let's change places.
I'll strangle you.
May I begin?
Go ahead.
- It tickles.
- You're frightened, huh?
It's you who's hesitating.
Go on. I'm ready.
Yes, it's beginning
to get hard.
I feel it inside me
getting harder.
I'm choking.
Do it slowly.
Now, I'm ready.
It feels so good.
- I've never felt like this.
- Feels good?
- I feel it moving!
- Feels good?
I can feel it.
It's moving.
Can't breathe.
- The geishas won't come in here.
- Why's that?
Because of your reputation.
Reputation. What do they say
about us? Tell me.
- That you're disgusting.
- Say that again!
- Let them talk.
- It's not their business.
What's disgusting
about us?
Well, you do nothing but
suck him all day long.
What's wrong with that?
What's disgusting
about it?
Why shouldn't I taste the body
of the man I love? Come back!
Let her be.
- Tell me who's talking about us!
- Everyone!
Everyone?
Not everyone. It's you, huh?
Now, tell me if you think
we're disgusting. Well, do you?
Stop it!
Enough! She's only telling us
what she's heard.
Anyway, I don't care,
and you shouldn't either.
It doesn't matter what others
think of us.
I want you to rape her now!
No, don't, please.
I'll never marry if you do!
Get out!
You bitch! I can't bear
looking at you.
My respects to you both!
- She never stops sucking him!
- Good evening.
My! You are so virile
and forceful, Master.
- What should I play?
- Anything, as long as it's happy.
They say I'm disgusting.
What do you think? Am l?
How could they say so?
I never get enough of his body,
and I love it without restraint.
It's wonderful for a woman
to feel free with her lover.
You understand?
How old are you?
I'm 68 already.
How I envy your youth.
Tell me your opinion.
Do you find him attractive?
Oh, yes. I think
he's very attractive.
Would you like him?
I only meant
he was handsome.
If you like... I'll let him
make love to you.
It feels so young.
Extraordinary.
Look at that.
Poor woman couldn't hold back
any longer.
Disgusting!
I hope the shock
didn't kill her.
You look pale suddenly?
What's the matter?
You look as if you've
seen a ghost.
Don't say that.
I had the impression I was holding
my mother's dead body.
- How long has she been dead?
- I was a child. What about yours?
She died 3 years ago.
I wasn't living at home
and didn't see her die.
I heard she suffered. And Papa,
he died when I was young.
Everything must have an end.
- Sada.
- Is anything wrong?
Let's be happy forever.
I'll leave you here.
You look very troubled today.
You look as if the weight
of the world were on you.
Might we go away alone
for a week or so, Master?
Impossible!
If anyone knew of us, I'd have
to shoot myself in the head.
You're back? What happened?
Why did you return so soon?
Why did you go out?
You weren't here. I know it!
You let them clean the room!
Don't torture yourself.
I went for a haircut.
I was here
the rest of the time.
I know you're lying!
I'll kill you!
You decided to get a haircut...
while I earned money
for you to live on?
You told me your desire was
greater when I shaved my neck.
I desire you so, and one day
I'll use my knife on you.
You wouldn't do that to me.
To be strangled is better.
Really? So you'd like me
to strangle you?
Put that knife away.
You like being strangled?
All I want is
to give you pleasure.
"l want to be strangled."
Say it!
I want to be strangled.
Don't pull too hard.
- You're frightened, huh?
- I'm terrified.
Are you serious?
You're teasing me.
You don't look terrified.
I'm ready.
Pull it tight.
Don't be afraid.
Pull much tighter.
Feel it getting harder?
Do you?
Go ahead. Pull as hard
as you can.
You can choke me tighter.
- Did I hurt you?
- Wait a moment.
Why did you stop?
I was near ecstasy.
Listen, I know what I'll do.
I'll tie your hands.
Now you can't resist.
You can't stop me.
That's right.
If you dare refuse,
I'll pull even tighter.
You know I belong to you.
Do what you please. My body
is yours-- yours forever.
I'll start again
and keep pulling harder.
Slowly this time.
Does it hurt you?
Tell what it feels like.
Like I'm part of you.
Our bodies have melted into one,
bathing in a crimson pool.
Your expression is so strange.
You seem so distant.
- You frighten me. Say something.
- Say something? It's impossible.
You expect me to say something
when I can't breathe?
What give you pleasure
gives me happiness.
Do you want me
to kill you?
See?
I'm going to kill you.
I feel good.
I'm coming.
I'll kill you, at last!
Happy, Sada?
Sada?
I want you to try again.
This time, I don't know
if I can do it again.
Think you'll be able to?
You look so sad.
I'm sleepy, Sada.
Sleepy, that's all.
If I fall asleep,
will you begin again?
You'd like me
to strangle you again?
Y es.
This time, Sada...
don't stop;
it's too painful afterwards.
kichi-san.
kichi-san.
I'm starting now.
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.
Where are you now?
I'm not there yet.
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
kichi-san!
kichi-san.
For 4 days, carrying the part
she'd severed from his body...
Sada wandered through Tokyo.
Those arresting her were astounded
that she glowed with happiness...
The story shocked
all of Japan.
The compassion of the people
made her strangely popular.
These events took place
in 1936.
