I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.
ARE THEY RECORDING?
HELP ME!
CIGARETTE.
LIGHT.
WE'RE ALMOST AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE, SLEEPYHEAD.
I DON'T BELIEVE THE DREAM I JUST HAD.
I WAS IN A FOREST RUNNING BAREFOOT.
I WAS HURT,
AND I WAS BEING FOLLOWED BY SOMEBODY, AND...
WELL, THE MORE I RAN,
THE MORE I COULD SENSE HIM COMING CLOSER.
WHO WAS THE GUY STALKING YOU?
IT WASN'T A GUY, IT WAS ME.
THAT'S THE WEIRDEST PART.
IT WAS ME RUNNING AFTER ME.
DON'T YOU EVER HAVE NORMAL DREAMS?
NO.
BEING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS A BORE.
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PARTIED SO MUCH.
I FEEL SHITTY.
TAKE A REST.
I'LL WAKE YOU WHEN WE GET THERE.
REAL FUNNY.
I'LL DRIVE IF YOU LIKE.
LIKE LAST FRIDAY
OH, COME ON,
IT WAS LATE, AND I WAS TIRED.
TIRED? MORE LIKE WASTED.
WELL, IT WAS YOUR FAULT FOR DUMPING ME FOR 3 HOURS
AND DISAPPEARING WITH GOD KNOWS WHO.
I HOPE AT LEAST, THAT HE WAS WORTH IT.
HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT A SLUT!
ASSHOLE!
BIMBO!
BITCH!
SKANK!
YOU'RE A PIG.
ARE THERE ANY COOL PLACES TO GO OUT HERE IN THE COUNTRY?
I'M AFRAID THE TOWN HALL IS ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE.
WOW, IF I HAD TO LIVE HERE ALL YEAR ROUND,
I THINK I'D SHOOT MYSELF.
WELL, IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE.
BESIDES, REMEMBER
WE'RE HERE TO STUDY,
NOT TO PARTY.
HEY, WE ARE NOT DEAF, HUH?
CHILL OUT, MARIE.
OH.
COME ON, HENDRIX.
COME ON. COME ON.
I'M GONNA GET YOU.
BOOM, BOOM.
I'LL GET YOU, HENDRIX.
BOOM, BOOM.
TOM, STOP SHOUTING.
GO INSIDE.
YOU'RE GIVING ME A HEADACHE.
I'M JUST WAITING FOR ALEX TO GET HERE.
SHE'LL BE HERE BY THE TIME YOU TAKE YOUR BATH.
NO, I CAN'T.
ALEX HASN'T SEEN THE COWBOY.
ALL RIGHT,
GO INSIDE, TAKE YOUR BATH,
THEN PUT THE COWBOY SUIT ON AGAIN.
COME ON, HENDRIX.
COME ON. LET'S GO.
THOUGH I CAN'T SEE YOU FACE TO FACE ?
SOMEDAY I'LL BE WITH YOU, I KNOW
AND I BELIEVE
EYES ON THE ROAD.
YOU'VE STILL GOT SOME SARCASM, YOU KNOW.
AND I BELIEVE
THAT IT'S REALLY GONNA COME TO BE
ARE YOU SURE IT'S THIS WAY?
OF COURSE. JUST UP AHEAD.
YOU TURN RIGHT AT THE CORNFIELD.
OH, LOOK, LOOK.
THERE IT IS. TURN RIGHT.
NOW YOU GO STRAIGHT FOR ABOUT 4 KILOMETERS.
WOW, EASY TO GET LOST.
NOBODY USES THIS ROAD EXCEPT FOR TRACTORS.
AND IT'S GOODBYE, CAR.
YOU CAN'T ACT THAT WAY
EVERY TIME A GUY TRIES TO TALK TO YOU.
I DON'T ACT THAT WAY WITH EVERYONE.
COME ON, MARIE,
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME STORY.
AND YOU KNOW IT.
STOP!
WHAT'S WRONG?
I THINK I SAW SOMEONE.
HEY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY ALEX.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
I SAW SOMEONE IN THE CORNFIELD.
STOP SCREWING AROUND LIKE THAT, WILL YOU?
ALEX, COME BACK, PLEASE.
ALEX!
I BELIEVE
THAT IT'S REALLY GONNA COME
SHIT.
ALEX.
ALEX.
IF THIS IS A JOKE,
I'LL MAKE YOU REGRET IT.
ALEX, WHERE ARE YOU?
ALEX?
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS,
DAMN IT!
ALEX, CUT IT OUT.
ALEX?
ALEX!
STOP, BITCH. COME BACK.
COME BACK!
COME ON, I AM SICK OF YOUR LITTLE GAME.
DAMN YOU.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
I COULD HAVE LEFT YOU OUT HERE, YOU KNOW.
YEAH, VERY FUNNY.
YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.
NO.
GO ON, LAUGH YOUR HEAD OFF.
VERY FUNNY.
MARIE, REMEMBER,
MY FAMILY JUST MOVED HERE 6 MONTHS AGO.
THEIR FRENCH IS WORSE THAN MINE.
HERE WE ARE.
ALL RIGHT.
I SEE WHY YOU PASSED YOUR EXAMS SO EASILY.
YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME HERE.
THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH ELSE TO DO EXCEPT STUDY.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE ONLY REAL EXCITEMENT AROUND HERE
IS WHEN A TRAIN RUNS THROUGH.
TAKE IT EASY, HENDRIX.
EASY, BOY.
HI.
HELLO, DAD.
HOW ARE YOU?
DON'T WORRY, HE DOESN'T BITE.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME OR THE DOG?
MARIE, THIS IS MY POP.
POP, MARIE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO NICE TO SEE A PERSON AND NOT JUST A PHOTO OF YOU.
PHOTO?
YOU KNOW, THE ONE I TOOK IN SPAIN.
IT'S ON THE FIREPLACE.
YOU'RE PART OF THE FURNITURE.
AND THIS IS TOM.
HELLO, COWBOY.
AH.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY TO SEE ME?
OF COURSE HE'S HAPPY.
HE INSISTED ON WAITING UP ALL NIGHT FOR YOU.
AND YOUR MOTHER HAS BEEN WORRYING THE WHOLE DAY, OF COURSE.
MOM ALWAYS WORRIES FOR NOTHING.
I THINK SHE LEFT YOU SOMETHING IN THE OVEN.
OH, I TOLD HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
WELL, SHE WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE GONNA HAVE TIME TO EAT.
OH, MOTHER.
I'LL PUT TOM THUMB TO BED,
AND I'LL SHOW MARIE HER ROOM.
RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.
GOOD NIGHT, GIRLS.
GOOD NIGHT, POP.
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.
SWEET DREAMS.
SO, WHAT WAS THIS PLACE BEFORE?
IT WAS AN OLD FARM THAT MY FATHER RENOVATED.
THERE'RE LOTS OF THEM IN THE AREA.
MOST OF THEM ARE IN RUINS.
IT'S TOO BAD.
THEY'VE LIVED HERE HALF A YEAR NOW.
DID THEY HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH NEIGHBORS?
YOU MEAN THE REDNECKS? YEAH.
THEY FIRST THOUGHT MY PARENTS WERE HIPPIES
HERE TO MAKE GOAT CHEESE,
BUT THINGS ARE FINE NOW.
WELL, HERE'S MY ROOM.
MMM-HMM.
YEAH?
OK, FOLLOW ME.
MY PARENTS' ROOM IS ON THE RIGHT.
UH-HUH.
THIS IS TOM'S ROOM.
YOU'RE UPSTAIRS IN THE GUEST ROOM, OK?
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT HIM TO BED.
OK, ALL TUCKED IN.
NIGHTY-NIGHT.
IS THAT YOU, ALEX?
MY MOTHER.
I'LL MEET YOU UPSTAIRS.
HI, MOM.
IS YOUR FRIEND ALL SETTLED IN?
SHOW HER WHERE THE BLANKETS ARE.
OK.
CLEAN TOWELS ARE IN THE CLOSET.
DON'T WORRY.
YOUR VERY OWN BATHROOM,
HUH?
THE HEATER'S ELECTRIC.
DO YOU WANT IT ON?
NO, I CAN DO IT IF I GET COLD.
WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S LIKE A DOLL'S HOUSE, VERY PRETTY.
THE PROBLEM IS,
HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPLIT UP WITH.
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED, THEN?
SOMEONE WHO'S TAKEN MUST BE WORTH IT.
I'M SKEPTICAL OF SINGLE GUYS.
HERE. FINISHED?
THANKS.
I THINK IT'S TOO EASY TO BE A WOMANIZER
WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY TAKEN.
WELL, COULD BE RIGHT, I GUESS.
MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE ME.
WHAT'S HIS GIRLFRIEND LIKE?
SHE'S BRAZILIAN.
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER 3 MONTHS.
A BRAZILIAN?
WHAT, IS HE INTO EXOTICISM OR SOMETHING?
WHATEVER. I NEED TO GET A TAN, QUICK.
AND I GOTTA WORK ON MY ASS.
I TELL YOU, THAT GIRL IS BUILT.
IF YOU DO SALSA, I'LL GO WITH YOU.
GO EASY ON THEM, ALL RIGHT?
OR THEY'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT, CHIRPING.
AND YOU, MARIE?
ARE YOU GOING TO FINALLY TAKE THE PLUNGE?
DON'T START WITH THAT.
YOU'RE GONNA END UP ALONE.
I'M NOT A SLUT LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE SO SCARED.
WELL.
I'M GONNA HAVEA SMOKE OUTSIDE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
I'M BEAT.
I'M GOING TO BED.
DON'T BE TOO LONG.
I'LL WAKE YOU AT 9:00.
WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN?
I WAS THINKING
INTERNATIONAL LAW TO START.
OK.
GOOD NIGHT, ALEX.
GOOD NIGHT.
HEY, ALEX?
I'M GLAD THAT I FINALLY MET YOUR FAMILY.
COME ON, HENDRIX. LET'S GO.
GOOD NIGHT, HENDRIX.
