Excuse me, sir, is this
the right train to Newhaven?
Yeah. Next train
on this platform, sir.
Thanks.
All right.
Malcolm, Malcolm.
Evening, guv.
Uh, right, 11:30, Newhaven.
Done and done.
Thank you very much.
Bad news?
No.
Right. Congratulations.
Ken called in sick.
Looks like you're
on the Eastborough redeye.
Tonight?
Mmhmm.
Hang on,
I've just done my shift.
They must all be lawabiding
citizens on your trains.
You haven't issued
a penalty fare in six weeks.
Or are you
just not man enough?
I'll do it.
Good boy.
Platform nine.
You alright, love?
Fine.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is your guard speaking.
I would like
to welcome you aboard
the 23:59 Alpha Trax
service to Eastborough,
calling at Morsley Junction,
Woolscot, Edgcombe,
Abington Cross, Wychford,
Christchurch, Barrock's Hill,
Old Milton, and arriving
at Eastborough at 1:48.
I'd like to remind you
at this time
to have your tickets
ready for inspection.
Thank you.
Tickets, please.
Ta. Lovely.
Thank you, madam.
Tickets and passes, please.
Tickets, please.
Good, thank you, sir.
Excuse me, madam, tickets.
get that for you.
Obviously not a fan of trains.
Nasty man.
Tickets, please.
Thank you, madam.
Ticket, please.
What? Oh, Christ. Um...
Hang on.
No rush, you're alright.
That's weird.
I had it this morning.
Today has just been
a complete nightmare.
Let's see...
If you don't have a valid pass
I have to charge the full fare.
What? Seriously?
I take this train every single day.
Those are the rules.
Where is it
you're traveling to?
Eastborough.
Eastborough...
That's gonna be £39 then, please.
Thank you.
Ta.
Apologies. Just wait
for your change.
Sorry.
That's lovely, thank you.
Tickets, please!
Can I see your tickets, please?
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you get a proper job?
It was so great.
The guys, they were so hot.
I'll go tomorrow.
About 12ish, is that alright?
We'll go home, get changed,
and I can wear shorts.
It was brilliant.
I wish you were there.
Tickets and passes, please.
I ran so hard I wet myself.
Yeah... It's really boring.
But the party was amazing.
You'd have loved it.
It was what you
thought it was gonna be.
Can I see your ticket, please?
It was a great night.
You should've been there.
I know! Well, yeah.
It was so brilliant.
Tickets, please?
Yeah, that'll be really cool.
I like that. Yeah. Anyway...
Can you get off your phone?
You're in a quiet zone.
Yeah. That'll be really cool.
Anyway, he's such a boring...
Miss?
I know, right?
Thank you.
Oh, my God, this guy
is totally staring at my tits.
Such a perv.
What can I say?
It's not my fault.
It was so funny.
Thank you. Ta.
Tickets, please.
Thank you, sir.
Can I see
your ticket, please?
Thank you.
Tickets, please. Thank you.
Any coffee?
See your tickets, please.
For you, sir?
Chicken?
Thanks.
Hiya.
Alright?
£1.85, please.
Didn't realize
you were on tonight.
Yeah, double shift.
Trying to save as much
as I can this month.
Oh, right. Yeah.
Dave's done the same to me.
You still trying to go?
I haven't decided yet.
I don't wanna be serving chicken
sandwiches the rest of my life.
No.
Yes?
Coffee, white,
two sugars, please.
And why would you?
Sorry about your promotion.
David told me.
I think
he told everyone.
Oh.
That doesn't surprise me.
Ah, it's not the end
of the world.
Something else better
will come up, I'm sure.
Well, you should try again.
You know, you're good
with the passengers.
People like you.
Ellen...
Do you want to go
for a drink later on?
Um... Um...
Well, I don't think
anywhere will be open.
Yeah, no, probably not.
Um, I'm on again
in the morning, so...
Yeah.
I better get on,
but good luck next time.
Oh, it was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.
Don't worry about it.
I meant with
the supervisor application.
Right.
Need a piss.
Well done.
That went well, mate.
PM
This is the driver.
Sorry for the bump.
Seems we hit
something on the line.
Please remain seated.
We should be on our way shortly.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.
That was quite a ride, mate.
Sorry about that, sir.
Yeah.
You alright, Ellen?
Look at this mess.
Don't worry about the mess.
We'll sort that out.
No, I'll do that.
No, no, no.  do that.
Allow me.
Thanks!
Any time.
Are these yours?
Cheers, yeah.
Mine, too. Thank you.
Maybe you should
check on the others?
Right, yeah. OK.
You're both sound, fine?
Yeah, I think we
got it covered.
Is everybody alright down here?
Madam, you alright?
Yes, yes, but what happened?
Have we crashed?
Did we come off the tracks?
We're trying to get
to the bottom of it.
You should have seat belts
if you wanna stop like that.
I hear you.
Sir, let me help you with these.
- Ged, please!
- Did we come off the track?
Let me take these.
I'll do it!
We're alright.
It's her you wanna worry about.
Ged!
Just take a seat for me.
Calm down.
Miss, you alright?
I've gotta call my mum.
I could have died.
Are you OK, though?
If this is broken, I will sue.
I understand your concern,
but you need to calm down.
Don't touch me, pervert!
Are you alright?
What do you think?
You alright, mate?
Yeah. We going soon,
or what?
Yeah, yeah. I'm just waiting
to hear from the driver.
Just take it easy for a minute.
You alright down there, sir?
I dropped my book.
Dropped your book...
Right, hang on.
Sir, here's your book.
Here you go, sir.
Oh, thanks. I've lost my page now.
I'd just got to a good bit.
I think you'll be alright, mate.
Just stay there and keep calm.
Driver, this is the guard.
Hello?
Hello?
Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies once again for the delay.
I'm still waiting on word
from the driver.
Thanks for your patience.
Dear, oh, dear.
Come on, sausage. Come here.
Oh, found my page!
This is a no smoking train, miss.
Piss off.
You want me to get out and push?
I don't believe this.
What's happening?
I tried knocking.
He's not answering
the intercom either.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Maybe you should keep
an eye on the passengers.
Well, they wanna know
what's going on.
Perhaps give them some food
or something, keep them sweet.
Not much left.
Better than nothing.
No sign?
Hello. Hello. Um...
We seem to have broken down
just outside Eastborough.
I think...
I think it must be
Thornton Forest.
And we can't seem
to locate our driver.
Just looking for some advice
on how to proceed, over.
Tell me about it'.
We've got' chaos out there tonight.
We've got' trees
down... signal failures...
Sorry, go again on the ETA?
Four hours?
The storm has brought down
a lot of trees.
You want me to stay
on this skanky train?
Fuck right off.
What does the driver say?
Does he think he can fix it?
The driver...
He's working on it.
Right, so he might be able
to get us going again?
No... I don't know... Maybe?
Is the train
broken down or not?
What did he actually say?
I haven't been able to speak to him.
I can't get through.
Right. Forget it,
ask him myself.
You can't do that.
Well, watch me do that.
No, we don't know
where he is.
Sorry?
Are you telling us
the driver is missing?
Oh, my God.
He didn't come back.
Where's he gone?
I don't know.
I'm trying to work on it.
I didn't want to worry you
so I didn't say anything.
Well, that didn't really work,
did it?
I don't suppose you know
how to drive it?
The train, I mean.
I'm afraid not.
You need to get
your supervisor on the radio.
My husband
has high blood pressure.
He can't wait here all night.
I want my money back.
Please just calm down.
Alright!
Thank you.
Now, the way I see it,
we've got two options.
Either we all sit here
and compose our complaint letters,
or we actually do
something about it.
Like what?
Like use those wiggly things
on the end of your legs
and walk on out of here.
The station can't be more
than, what, a two-mile walk?
Three, max. We might even get
a phone signal before then.
I'm in.
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!
You can't just...
Safety protocol clearly states
passengers must stay
on the train and await assistance.
Those are the rules.
Ridiculous.
It's not.
I will lose my job.
Sir! You can't get out of there
without any keys.
And do you have
some keys?
Yes.
Would you kindly use them?
No.
Come on!
No, sir.
I will lose my job.
I can't open the door.
We can follow the tracks,
all stay together.
I don't see there'll be
a problem.
Yeah, come on.
It's stopped raining now.
- Please.
- Come on.
Well?
I can't leave the train
with these pensioners.
You just make sure
you keep up, son.
Come on!
Wouldn't you rather spend
the night in your own bed?
Huh?
Get your keys out.
Please.
I'm gonna lose my job
for doing this.
Come on.
Come on, then.
- OK?
- Yes, fine, come on.
Just keep straight
down there. Down there.
Keep this side of the...
Wait up there, please.
- Want a hand?
- I'll hold your arm.
Queue up there,
please, madam.
No, I'm first.
OK, I'll go first.
- Bit of a drop, isn't it?
- You'll be alright.
Perhaps you won't.
- OK...
- Careful.
Alright?
There's a rail here you've
just got to get your foot on.
Right... Ooh, OK.
Thank you very much.
Last but not least.
Whee!
Thanks.
It's my pleasure.
Five, six, seven...
Right, stick together, please.
Mind your step out here.
I'll light the path.
light the track.
That's the long metal thing
that the train goes on, is it, boss?
Stick together, please.
I'm Nina.
Billy.
Hey!
Fuel leak.
Oh.
Ooh!
Why don't you walk with me?
We don't want you
falling over in the dark.
Stick together, please!
Recognize where we are?
Could be Thornton Forest.
You all right
there at the back, sir?
Can you hurry up at the front?
I want to get there tonight.
Not exactly
a favorite pastime of mine,
trekking through the woods.
Don't worry, it's just
a deer or something.
Keep going.
Come on, guys,
it's getting closer now.
Do you think
it could be the driver?
Why would he be
in the bushes?
I don't know.
It just sounds like it could be.
Just wait here.
Can we not just keep on going?
What do you mean "wait here"?
You can't just leave us.
I'll find out.
Where are you going?
Leave us on our own.
- Where's he gone?
- Come on!
Joe, what is it?
Go. Go.
Back on the train, everyone!
Get back
on the train, everyone!
Hurry!
Come on!
Joe, hurry!
Where's the key?
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!
Quick!
Alright, go. Go, go, go, go!
- Quickly!
- Hurry up.
Joe, get in!
Joe, get in!
Wait!
Come on!
Wait!
Hurry, come on. Hurry!
- Get in, quick.
- Come on, Joe!
Wait!
Let's go, come on!
- Help me!
- Get in, get in! In, in!
Shut the fucking door!
We need to move her.
Someone help me get her up!
We need to get her up.
Help me, please.
Lift, lift. Please.
And lift. Lift her up.
Come on. OK, lift.
Calm down,
shh, calm down.
Everyone, step back!
We'll lie her down
on the chair.
Try and calm her down.
Here, take this.
Alright, wrap it round.
Above the wound. Tighter!
Pull it down. Step back.
What can you see?
I can't see anything!
Get the first aid kit!
And water!
Shh.
Breathe, breathe.
- Hurry up.
- Get some water!
You'll be fine.
- Shh...
- Breathe, breathe.
Everybody just stay calm!
I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh, my God, I don't know
what I'm doing.
Pressure on,
get the pressure on!
What do you see?
I can't see anything!
The door! Is it secure?
Check the door.
Just over there.
What the fuck was that?
Keep her quiet,
for fuck's sake!
Shh...
Get her to shut the fuck up.
What is that?
Fuck. Fuck.
Shh...
Shh... Please.
It's gone. It's gone.
It's gone.
We've got to get her
to a hospital.
We need to get her
to a hospital.
Joe, we've got
to call someone.
Joe! Joe!
Joe. Joe...
Joe! Joe!
We need to call someone.
We need to call... call someone.
Just get someone, Joe.
Now! Now! Go, now!
This is the Eastborough
sprinter service
requesting immediate
emergency assistance.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?!
You alright, mate?
Yeah. Yeah, fine.
This was working earlier.
How about getting
the engine started?
I haven't got the first clue
about trains. Do you?
I know engines.
Dirt bikes, lawnmowers.
It's my old man's business, repairs.
- There's your problem.
- The fuel leak?
Yeah, the line must have split
when we crashed.
There might be some left
in the tank, but...
without pressure we ain't gonna
be able to restart her.
We're going nowhere
till it's patched.
I better tell the others.
We're just gonna have
to sit tight and wait for help.
My wife needs
medical attention now!
And meanwhile we're just
a train full of bear bait.
It wasn't a bear.
Bears don't howl.
What was it then, a wolf?
A dog couldn't do that.
There haven't been any bears
or wolves round here for centuries.
What animal did that to her?
It wasn't an animal.
It was more like a man.
Just lie back, love.
You need to rest.
No, you're not listening.
You don't understand.
It wasn't an animal.
She's in shock.
What happened
to the driver?
What?
What aren't you telling us?
That's inside the train.
Inside?
What are you doing?
No, that's not a good idea.
Oh, fuck.
You've got a knife, right?
Why would I have a knife?
Get a key!
Hurry UP!
No, no!
Fuckin' hell!
Ow! Oh, fuck!
Fuck.
Stinks of piss down here.
Who are you?
He's one of the passengers
from earlier. Help him up.
I don't-I don't believe this.
So... So what you're saying...
is...
is that we've definitely
gone past Barrock's Hill?
Have you not heard anything
we just told you?
No signal.
What a surprise.
I can't believe
I missed my stop.
It's great to have you on board.
Try to hold still, love.
She's got a fever.
Shock?
I've dealt
with a dog bite before,
but I don't know
what I'm doing.
Ellen, just sit down,
stay calm for a minute.
Sit down.
There you are.
You OK?
What's wrong with her?
They're looking after her,
don't worry.
She'll be fine.
There was so much blood.
My daughter's got shoes like those.
They're cool.
Thanks.
She cannot wait
to be a teenager.
She hardly ever talks
to me anymore.
She says that I embarrass her.
You seem pretty nice.
My mum's my best friend.
Really?
There's hope for me yet, then.
Won't she wonder
where you are?
No. She's usually in bed
by the time I get home,
and weekends
she's with her dad, so I never...
It's back.
What the fuck is that?
Maybe someone's come to...
Shh...
What the fuck is it?
Stay back.
Where's it going?
Just be quiet. Shh.
- Whose phone is that?
- Not mine!
- What the fuck?
- It must be someone's!
Someone's got reception!
It's yours. Answer it!
Oh, my God. It's me.
Well, answer it, then.
Hello? Hello?
Who is it?
Mum, you've got to listen to me.
Something's happened.
Tell her where we are.
Please, Mum, no, please.
Give me the phone.
Tell her where we are!
Out of my way.
Give me that thing!
Get off me!
Help me!
Come on!
Shh, shh, shh!
Shut up! Shut up!
I think it's gone.
What is it?
Does anyone know?
It ain't a fucking dog,
I can tell you that.
Shut up!
We can't just leave her!
She's gone!
We've got to go back!
Hey, hey, come back!
She might still be alive,
We can't just leave her!
Why did you stop me?
I could have got her!
I was trying to save you!
It was too late for her!
It's your fault!
Stop it.
You still wanna sit and wait?
I didn't know this would happen!
You've got to do something!
It's too easy for it to get in.
What are we gonna do?
Stop listening to this prick.
He's doing his best!
I shouldn't even
be on this train.
Enough!
Do you all wanna die tonight?
Cos if you do, you just
carry on whinging and arguing,
and soon enough,
that thing out there,
he'll take care of it for you.
But if you still intend to get home,
then start acting like it.
It's an animal.
Animals hunt
what's easy to catch.
And look at us.
We're sitting ducks here.
So let's try and make it
a little bit harder
for the bastard, shall we?
Have you got any tools
on this train?
What's wrong with you?
Dodgy kebab gave me the shits.
Oh! It's not easy, is it?
What?
Here. Here,  help you. Yeah.
Thank you.
Listen, I'm sorry about being
such a cow to you before.
It's just... I've spent too much
of my life on this train.
Tell me about it.
Jenny, here's
some water, love.
Oh, sorry,
it's nearly empty.
Was there any water anywhere?
Joe's got the last bottle.
Right.
I was told you might have
a bottle of water.
Yeah, course.
What was her name?
Who?
The girl...
The girl who was...
Oh. Ooh, um...
I don't know.
Do you have any children?
Yes. I've got a daughter
who's about to be 13.
Oh.
You?
Wasn't to be.
We wanted to, but...
Like we always say,
we have each other
and that's
the most important thing.
Thank you.
And thank you
for getting us in here.
No problem.
You're doing alright, you know.
It's coming back, you know.
Sorry?
Our friend out there
is coming back.
Might not.
Might have had enough.
Yeah.
Let me show you something.
Country house.
Wife, kids, dog, the works.
But then there's this.
A city flat.
Five minutes' walk
from the office,
nice view of Tower Bridge,
perfect for entertaining
young ladies.
Discreet.
Two worlds never meet,
and everyone is happy.
Good for you.
The point is, we do
what we have to to get by.
Sometimes it ain't nice.
Take this lot.
Old, weak, afraid.
They're natural born victims.
And when that thing comes back,
when it gets in here,
you can stand with them
and wait your turn to die,
or you can use your keys
and open one of these doors,
and maybe...
maybe you and I...
can get out of this alive.
Survival of the fittest,
my friend.
You think about it.
Jesus.
Jenny... Jenny.
Can you hear me?
What the fuck's
happening to her?
She needs help.
She's sick.
But why are
her teeth falling out?
Shut it!
Look, old man,
I am just saying that...
I know what you're saying.
Stop it!
Joe? Joe?
Someone's missing.
The football guy.
He said he needed a shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
He's gone.
You don't know that.
Just give him a minute.
Wait here.
Hurry up.
- Hey. hey, where's he going?
- What's happening?
Don't wanna lose anyone else.
It's fine.
Just one minute.
I'm not leaving this open.
Paul?
What?
Paul, come on, hurry up,
open the door.
You've got to get in the other carriage.
It's not safe here.
Fuck's sake.
Paul?
What?!
Paul, hurry up.
I can't do a shit
in peace.
No, it's not safe.
For fuck's sake.
Come on. Come on!
The... The door...
What?
I can't open the door!
Oh, fuck.
The door is jammed!
Right... That's it.
What are you doing?
He's been long enough.
Shit! Help me!
Help me!
Let me go!
Get me the fuck out!
Shit! Get me out of here!
Get me out! Fuck!
Get me out!
It's fucking broke...
Come on!
Fucking open the fucking door!
What are you doing?
Getting out of here.
We're trapped
on this fucking train.
What about Joe?
He made his choice.
At least he had the guts to try.
You should have gone with him!
You should be helping him!
Just get out the fucking train!
We need to get them out, too!
Fuck!
Hurry up!
The key.
Open the fucking door!
Fucking hell...
Let's barricade it, quick!
Hold it, hold it!
It's coming, it's coming!
- It's not gonna open!
- Hey!
We need your help!
Pass me that.
Do something! Help him!
Fucking die!
It's dead. It's OK.
Fucking let go!
It's dead.
Shh... It's gone. OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
What did we just kill?
It's a man.
But its legs... and its teeth...
are more like a dog's.
More like a wolf's.
What?
Just saying.
What are you saying?
Isn't it obvious?
We're looking
at a werewolf.
What, like a full moon
and silver bullet sort of thing?
No...
But look at the legs,
triplejointed,
the eyes, teeth.
Whatever it is, it's some kind
of hybrid between man and wolf.
It's wearing a ring. Look.
It used to be like us.
Perhaps it's a disease.
Like a mutation.
Something you catch
from animals.
Or a bite.
You're all too young to remember
the Thornton Forest rail crash.
Late night express came
off the tracks, somewhere near here.
When the emergency services
got to them,
there was no one left to save.
All sorts of tales
about what they found,
bodies half eaten by animals,
some just gone.
They never did find out
what really happened.
I never gave it much
thought after that.
Until tonight.
So this has happened before.
We've killed it now,
so we're sweet.
Jenny?
Jen?
Honey?
She's one of them.
She's fucking one of them.
You leave her alone!
She's sick.
No, she's not.
She is infected.
We all know it.
And if we are gonna survive,
she has to go.
You touch one hair
on my Jenny's head
and  break your bloody neck.
I don't think so, old man.
Stay away from her, OK?
Alright.
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop it!
Leave her alone!
Why don't you take a seat, sir.
Ged! Ged, where am I?
Alright, Jenny.
Where am I?
Thank you.
- Give me your fucking belt.
- What?
Give me your belt!
- Tie him down.
- With pleasure.
Her, too.
We can't stay here.
We're not going to.
You've done this before.
Dirty bitch.
Ow!
If we can find the leak,
patch it up,
there might be enough left
to get us moving.
All we need is enough
to get clear of the woods.
Who's going?
Me.
I'm the only one
who knows how.
I could do
with a lookout, though.
I'll do it.
That's that sorted then.
So the ASBO kid's
fixing the train?
I know engines, you prick.
Yeah, right.
I got accepted onto
an engineering course, actually.
That's why I was in town today.
Impressive.
Nuhuhuhuhuh.
Watch him.
Of course.
Let's go.
Engine lights.
These go green, it means
I've patched the leak.
Fuel gauge.
That needle bounces up,
you need to turn on
the ignition here.
Then the main light
should come on.
That's it?
Not quite.
Next you need to prime the pump.
Pull down hard here.
Engage forward
on the column,
then you need to push
forward on the accelerator.
Nice and slowly.
Drive us out of this shithole, yeah?
Oh, and if you could remember
to pick me up on the way out,
buy you a beer.
Is it true?
About your interview?
Yeah, pretty much.
I saw you chuck
your jacket and tie in the bin.
Huh. Stupid cow said I needed
A-levels, didn't she?
Guess we'll see
if she was right.
I think you
should say something.
This is your guard speaking.
I'd like to apologize
once again
for the delay to your journey
this evening.
A few hours ago
we were strangers.
Most of you probably wish
we still were.
But we're gonna try
and get out of here now.
We're gonna do
whatever it takes to survive.
Together.
I know you all
just want to get home.
Next stop, Eastborough.
You ready?
Yeah.
Shine it down there.
This is it.
Keep an eye out, yeah?
OK...
You don't remember me
at all, do you?
Should I?
I've been trying
to place you all night.
Must be three years ago now?
I came for an interview
at Naughton and Price Brokers.
I thought it was going
quite well, actually.
But you couldn't stop
looking down my top.
You had a tan line where your
wedding ring should have been.
And? Well, you obviously
didn't make the grade.
Oh, well, I was
more than qualified.
But you were more interested
in taking me back home
for a followup.
Yes...
But you're right.
I don't remember you.
But I know your type.
Oh, yes?
You arrive one day
in my office, full of sparkle...
happy to fight it out
with the boys
for a seat at the big table.
And then after a couple of years
you swan off for nine months.
And when you return,
you're tired all the time,
wracked by guilt,
all that baby weight
making it oh-so-hard
to fight your way
back up the ladder.
No more sparkle.
Jesus.
I feel sorry for your wife.
Don't you worry about her.
Hope you haven't got
any kids to fuck up, too.
Come on, Jenny. Hold on.
Gonna get you
out of here soon.
Use your eyes, granddad.
There is no helping her.
She just needs the hospital.
They'll be able to do something.
If we don't do something
about her now,
it'll be too late.
Joe?
Why did you want that
stupid promotion anyway?
I don't know.
I guess I thought
I could change something.
Make people notice me.
It's what you do that matters,
not what it says
on your name badge.
You've helped those people.
You've helped all of us.
Hmm.
I'm seriously thinking about
a change of career after tonight.
Fuck, come on.
Fuck, where are you?
Come on, come on.
Matt... Matt?
Chuck me the tape.
Found the leak.
Underqualified, my arse.
Here, chuck me that wrench.
Ah, there we go.
OK.
Ah, fuck.
Listen, um, about before,
all that business with the ax.
I don't know
what came over me.
OK, mate.
OK...
Help...
Help me...
Get that light on me, buddy.
Matt, keep that light on me.
Matt! Matt! What the fuck
are you doing?
For fuck's sake...
Hello?
Help me!
Hello?
Help!
Where are you?
Help!
Look, I...
About before, I...
I'm sorry, I...
It just all happened so quickly.
Where are you?
Help...
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck.
Hey!
Help!
Matthew!
Fuck! She's fucking changing!
Come on, let me out of here!
She's turning, come on!
There's one wolf out there
and there's one fucking wolf
in here.
We're all gonna die!
Just shut up and let me think!
Hey! Help! Fuck!
Untie me, you stupid bitch!
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
This should be it.
Ellen! Quick!
He got the lights on.
Oh!
OK. Fuel...
That one.
Right, what's next?
Pump.
Prime the pump.
Gears.
OK, what are we doing?
Just wait. Gotta wait for it.
Where are they?
OK, let's go. Let's go.
No, we can't. Ellen, no!
Shit. Shit.
Oh, my God. Come on.
We're moving.
Thank fuck!
Oh, God.
We're moving, Jenny.
Can you-
Oh, my God.
What the...
Oh, my God!
Fucking hell!
Fucking hell! Let me out
of here! Get me out of here!
Do it, do it, do it!
Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.
Help me.
Jenny.
It's working. No, look, it's working.
Look, it's working.
It's working. Go, come on,
it's going, it's going.
Christ!
Help me!
Help me!
No! No, God, no.
Oh, no!
Please don't... Please don't...
Please don't...
Please, please don't kill me.
No, no!
Jenny.
No!
Oh, shit.
Jenny.
Oh, God.
No... Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Oh...
No... No!
Fuck!
No!
Why has it stopped?
What's happened?
Ellen, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Stay away from me.
Stay away!
Better late than never.
Good to see you've
finally grown a pair.
Joe! Joe!
Come on! Come on then!
Where's Kate?
Where's Kate?
She'd still be alive
if you hadn't tied me up.
Where exactly
are we going to, boss?
The woods.
We'll never stand a chance.
Unless one of us stays behind.
Stop it!
Back off!
Get over there! Get back!
Fucking bitch.
You really think you're
in control, don't you, Joe?
You've finally become a man,
and you've stood up to
the challenge well.
Haven't you?
You think you've got it
all worked out, don't you?
Oh, no.
Come on, then!
Oi!
Fuck you, bitch.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, you fucking mutts!
Come on!
Get that door open.
Come on! Let's 'ave it!
Go, go, go! Billy!
Billy!
Come on!
Follow the track!
The track!
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
Let's go!
Too late.
What?
It's too late.
No, let's go!
They're on to us.
No, let's go, Joe!
There's a track.
There's a track there.
Joe!
Come on.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
No, no. No!
Joe! Joe, no, come on!
You have to go.
Come with me, Joe!
Run! Ellen, run!
Go! Go!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh! Ow.
First thing I'm gonna do
is buy this place
and burn it the fuck down.
Hello?
Who's there?
Hello?
Joe?
Where are you, mate?
Joe?
Oh, fuck!
