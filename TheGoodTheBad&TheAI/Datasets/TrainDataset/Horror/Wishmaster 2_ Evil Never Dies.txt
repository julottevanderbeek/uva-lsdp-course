LET'S GO!
COME ON. LET'S GO!
NOW! MOVE IT!
GO! GO!
STOP! RIGHT THERE!
MORGANA!
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I THINK SO.
EASY, EASY, EASY.
OH, GOD!
WHAT?
THIS STOPPED THE BULLET.
OH, MY GOD.
WH-WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
IT WAS INSIDE THE STATUE.
- DROP IT! -
NO! - WATCH OUT!
NO!
DON'T DIE. DON'T DIE.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.
GET OUT OF HERE.
NO.
I LOVE YOU, MORGANA.
GO.
GET OUTTA HERE.
JESUS.
ERIC.
FUCK OFF.
I CAN GIVE YOU LIFE
EVERLASTINGLY, IF YOU WISH IT.
I CAN END YOUR PAIN...
IF YOU WISH THAT.
I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN.
AS YOU WISH.
DONE.
- COVER THE BACK.
- YES, SIR.
LET'S GO.
FREEZE!
DID I HEAR YOU SAY "FREEZE"?
YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE GODDAMN
RIGHT. I SAID, "FREEZE!"
DONE.
THE TIME IS COME.
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
NOW, PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
NOW SLOWLY TURN AROUND.
OPEN UP YOUR HANDS.
SLOWLY.
YOU WANNA EXPLAIN THIS
TO ME?
HE NEEDED TO CHILL OUT.
CUFF HIM.
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
WHY?
YOU SAY YOU ACTED ALONE.
YOU SAY YOU SHOT AND KILLED TWO PRIVATE
SECURITY GUARDS IN THE COMMISSION OF A ROBBERY.
THAT IS CORRECT.
WHERE'S THE GUN?
I SAID I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST DISAPPEARED.
WHAT ABOUT THE SIX PAINTINGS
YOU CUT OUT OF THEIR FRAMES?
DID THEY DISAPPEAR TOO?
LOOK. NATHANIEL.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE SHOOTER, SO WHO'RE
YOU TRYING TO PROTECT? A GIRLFRIEND?
SHE MUST BE A REAL GOOD FUCK. I MEAN,
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE INJECTION FOR HER.
HMM?
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND?
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND, YOU SLY
DEVIL. YOU LITTLE FAGGOT, YOU.
ACTUALLY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
TRYIN' TO PULL HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'D
LIKE, AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.
THE FUCK YOU WILL,
YOU LYIN' SACK OF SHIT!
YOU GIVE ME NOTHIN'
BUT HORSESHIT!
I'M THE ONE THAT ASKS THE
QUESTIONS HERE, NOT YOU!
- UNDERSTOOD?
- YES.
QUESTIONS. ANSWERS.
AS INTELLIGENT A MAN
AS YOU ARE,
DON'T YOU WISH YOUR JOB
WERE A LITTLE MORE EXCITING?
- WILLET!
- YES, SIR.
GET THIS ASSHOLE
OUTTA MY FACE.
LET'S GO.
GUY GIVES ME THE WILLIES.
IN A CASE THAT CONTINUES
TO BAFFLE POLICE OFFICIALS,
NATHANIEL DEMAREST PLEADED GUILTY TO CHARGES
THAT HE ROBBED THE SAROM ART GALLERY...
AND MURDERED TWO SECURITY
GUARDS. THIS IS BULLSHIT.
JUDGE EDWARD LAVWITZ REMANDED DEMAREST
TO COUNTY PRISON PENDING SENTENCING.
BUT QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN AS TO
HOW DEMAREST COMMITTED THESE CRIMES,
SINCE A WEAPON WAS NEVER FOUND NOR HAVE
POLICE DISCOVERED THE MISSING WORKS OF ART.
AS FOR THE 3,000-YEAR-OLD
STATUE DAMAGED IN THE ROBBERY,
EXPERTS ARE CONFIDENT
IT CAN BE RESTORED.
CALLED AHURA MAZDA, IT DEPICTED AN
ANCIENT PERSIAN DEITY OF THAT NAME.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
MEANWHILE,
THE FAMILY OF SLAIN SECURITY GUARD
ARNELL DAWES REMAIN IN SECLUSION.
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FATHER OF TWO WILL
BE HELD ALONG WITH THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD.
POLICE CHIEF HOWARD SAID THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL
CEREMONY AT CITY HALL TO HONOR THE OFFICERS.
REPORTING LIVE FROM CITY HALL
- SHUT UP!
WHAT'S THE MATTER IN THERE?
HOW ABOUT YOUR TIGHT
LITTLE YUPPIE ASS?
OH, I'M NO YUPPIE.
DON'T FUCK WITH ME,
BITCH!
I'LL FUCK UP YOUR LIFE, YOU
COCKSUCKER. YOU UNDERSTAND?
I BELIEVE YOU MEAN YOU'LL DO ME GREAT
BODILY HARM IF I'M DECEIVING YOU.
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT.
MAKE A WISH,
ANY WISH YOU LIKE.
UH-HUH?
ALL RIGHT. UH, THOSE ARE NICE SHOES.
WHAT, ARE THEY SOME KIND OF ENGLISH SHIT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- TAKE 'EM OFF.
TAKE THE FUCKIN' SHOES OFF, OR
- I LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE A POWERFUL MAN.
WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR POWER? I'M GIVING YOU
THE CHANCE TO WISH FOR ANYTHING YOU LIKE.
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN
DO BETTER THAN A PAIR OF SHOES.
WHOA! WHOA!
YOU'RE A FUCKIN' GENIE!
HEY, FUCK!
HE'S A FUCKIN' GENIE!
WE GOT A FUCKIN' GENIE IN OUR
CELL! HELL, YOU'RE A GENIE, HUH?
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY. FINE.
FINE, BECAUSE I'M GONNA
MAKE A WISH.
IF THE WISH DON'T COME TRUE, I'M
GONNA OWN YOUR LILY WHITE, YUPPIE,
MOTHERFUCKIN',
GOLF PLAYIN' ASS.
IF THE WISH COMES TRUE,
I OWN YOU.
THE FUCKIN' STATE
OWNS ME!
JESUS CHRIST.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. FINE. GREAT.
YOU SEE THE BARS THERE?
I WANNA WALK RIGHT THROUGH
THE BARS, MAN,
AND WALK RIGHT ON
OUTTA THE JAIL.
COME ON. COME ON, GENIE.
DONE.
YOU WOKE ME.
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
MORGANA.
HELLO, GREGORY.
FATHER.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
IT'S STILL A CHURCH.
IT'S WHERE I LIVE.
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
ALL RIGHT?
I JUST NEEDED TO TALK,
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE-
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH YOU, MORGANA. NO.
NO. THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE-
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?
DO YOU-
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE DEVIL?
I BELIEVE IN GOD.
YEAH. SO IF, UM,
IF GOD EXISTS, THEN SATAN
HAS TO EXIST TOO, RIGHT?
IS THERE A POINT
TO THIS?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
ERIC'S DEAD.
IS THAT WHAT YOU CAME HERE
TO TELL ME?
NOT REALLY, NO.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
JUST SAY "I'M SORRY."
I'M SORRY.
BUT HE WASN'T
THE RIGHT MAN FOR YOU.
I LOVED HIM.
DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT LOVE IS? DO YOU?
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME,
AND SO YOU CAME HERE.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT REAL LOVE IS.
GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT
HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON-
I DON'T NEED A SERMON,
GREGORY, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
MORGANA?
I NEED ANSWERS.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THE QUESTIONS YET.
GOOD-BYE.
I'M GETTING IT ON
WITH MY SISTER-IN-LAW.
NEXT THING I KNOW THE BITCH
DROPS FUCKING DIME ON ME.
ATTEMPTED RAPE. I GOT THIS
LOSER FOR A FUCKIN' P.D.,
AND IT'S MY THIRD
FUCKIN' HIT.
THAT'S FUCKED UP, MAN.
CHECK THIS OUT, MAN.
I GET STOPPED AT A LIGHT.
THEY CHECK IN THE TRUNK.
I GET BUSTED
FOR A BOGUS SEARCH.
MY LAWYER PLEA BARGAINS THREE-TO-FIVE
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FUCKING WALKED.
PUCK-ASSED MOTHERFUCKER
SHOULD GO FUCK HIMSELF.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WHO'S THIS GUY?
WHO YOU TALKIN' TO,
YOU FUCKIN' FAGGOT?
I'M TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T BELONG HERE.
I'M GONNA DO YOU A BIG FAVOR BECAUSE
YOU'RE NEW AND YOU'RE IGNORANT,
AND NOT RIP THE FUCKIN' TONGUE OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH FOR TALKIN' TO ME.
I'M GOING TO DO YOU
A FAVOR,
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN UNJUSTLY
IMPRISONED MAN.
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR LAWYER PAID FOR ALL
THE SUFFERING HE'S PUT YOU THROUGH. YES?
MAN, ARE YOU TRIPPING? WHO THE
FUCK ARE YOU? THE WISHMASTER.
I MAKE WISHES
COME TRUE.
OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU BETTER WISH
FOR SOME FUCKIN' SENSE REAL QUICK.
I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU'D LIKE TO
SEE YOUR LAWYER GO FUCK HIMSELF.
I COULD ARRANGE THAT.
YOU AIN'T PLAYIN' FOR REAL,
MY BOY HERE'S-
I ONLY PLAY FOR REAL.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
YOUR SOUL.
FUCK IT, MAN. MAKE IT HAPPEN. FREEZE.
LET'S GO, MAN.
YOUR LAWYER'S HERE.
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.
COME ON.
I SAID COME ON!
GET HIM OUTTA HERE,
MAN!
WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE, BOYS?
WISHMASTER.
I LIKE TO FLATTER MYSELF.
FLATTER THIS,
MOTHERFUCKER.
FUCK OFF.
NOW-
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYIN' TO DO ANY
BUSINESS HERE, WOULD YOU, BRO?
JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH, BROTHER?
I'M SURE THERE IS.
I'LL BE WATCHIN' YOU.
WISHMASTER.
TINKER BELL LOOKIN'
MOTHERFUCKER.
HELLO, ROBERT.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?
YOU TELL ME. WELL, ACTUALLY, VERY WELL.
OH, YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.
I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YA.
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CASE
DIDN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME.
IT WAS THE SEARCH. IT WASN'T
HANDLED PROPERLY. I DID SOME DIGGING.
AND I UNCOVERED
A PROCEDURAL SCREW-UP...
THAT'S POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING
TO THE D.A.'s OFFICE.
I THINK THAT, UH, I CAN GET ALL
THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU DROPPED.
BACK UP, MAN, BACK UP.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLIN' ME?
YOU CAN GET
ALL THE CHARGES DROPPED?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN', MAN? THAT I CAN GO FREE?
THAT'S RIGHT, ROBERT. OF COURSE, WITH MY
CONNECTIONS AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT...
AND THE D.A.'s OFFICE,
I CAN-
GODDAMN, WHAT WAS THAT?
- ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?
- YEAH. WHOO!
EXCUSE ME. YEAH.
OKAY. UH.
WE WERE-
OOH!
YOU OKAY?
- OH, GOD. OKAY.
- WE WERE TALKING-
MISTER-
GUARD!
- GUARD!
- OHH!
GUARD! HE'S SICK, MAN, HE'S SICK!
AGH!
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
WHAT ABOUT MY CASE, MAN?
WHAT ABOUT MY CASE, MAN?
DONE.
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
GOD, THIS IS BULLSHIT.
"THE DEITY OF LIGHT
IN PRE-ISLAMIC PERSIA.
"HIS SHADOW WAS SAID TO CONTAIN
ALL THAT WAS DARK.
HE THUS CAME TO SYMBOLIZE
THE DUALITY OF GOOD AND EVIL."
WHO IS IT?
IT'S GREGORY.
COME ON UP.
"AHURA MAZDA WAS
ALSO KNOWN AS...
KEEPER OF THE STONE
OF THE SECRET FIRE."
NEVER SEEN A GIRL
WITHOUT HER MAKEUP BEFORE?
FATHER DMITRI TOLD ME YOU WERE
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH THE OTHER DAY.
YEAH. UM-
I WAS WALKING BY,
AND I DECIDED, UH-
DID YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME?
NOT REALLY, NO.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH. I'M FINE.
FATHER DMITRI SAID
YOU SEEMED ILL OR-
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING WELL LATELY.
STILL TRYING TO FIND
THE ANSWERS, HUH?
THE QUESTIONS KEEP
PILING UP.
I KEEP HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES
AND THINGS.
PEOPLE DYING. A VOICE KEEPS
SAYING, "FULFILL THE PROPHECY."
"FULFILL THE PROPHECY"?
I KEEP THINKING IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ERIC'S DEATH, YOU KNOW?
WHATEVER.
YEAH. ACTUALLY, THAT'S
WHY I WANTED TO COME BY.
I WANTED TO SAY I WAS SORRY.
I WAS WRONG, WHAT I SAID TO
YOU THE OTHER DAY ABOUT ERIC.
MY HEART IS TRULY
WITH YOU.
I KNOW.
THE WEIRD THING IS
I'M NOT EVEN SURE HE'S DEAD.
I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN NO REPORTS.
NOTHING ON THE NEWS.
W- W-WAIT A MINUTE.
MAYBE HE'S JUST MISSING.
WHY DO YOU PRESUME HE'S DEAD?
BECAUSE I SAW HIM SHOT.
WHAT? HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE POLICE?
IT WAS DURING A ROBBERY.
I WAS PART OF IT.
OH, MY GOD.
I KILLED THE MAN
WHO SHOT HIM.
HE LEFT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS.
AND THEN I HEAR ABOUT THIS NATHANIEL
DEMAREST GUY, ARRESTED AT THE SCENE.
CONFESSING TO EVERYTHING.
THE MURDERS, EVERYTHING!
W- WAIT- YOU HAVE TO
CONFESS. HE'S AN INNOCENT MAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS.
I THOUGHT AT FIRST MAYBE HE WAS
A POLICE PLANT OR SOMETHING.
BUT HE KEEPS SHOWING UP
IN MY DREAMS!
OR WHATEVER THEY ARE.
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU HAVE TO CONFESS. IT'S
YOUR ONLY WAY TO FIND PEACE.
ALL I KNOW IS...
I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHO THIS GUY IS...
AND GET HIM OUTTA MY LIFE.
I'LL NEED SOME I.D.
WE NEED DETERGENT.
MR. DEMAREST.
YES?
I'M OSIP KRUTCHKOV.
HOW DO YOU DO?
I DO VERY WELL, MR. KRUTCHKOV. AND YOU?
OH, CALL ME OSIP.
I'M AS WELL AS I CAN BE
IN THIS FUCKING SHIT HOLE.
YOU'D LIKE TO BE OUT OF HERE.
WHO WANTS TO BE IN PRISON...
WHEN HE CAN BE
A FREE MAN?
PERHAPS I COULD HELP.
SO I AM TOLD.
REALLY?
WHAT WERE YOU TOLD?
THAT YOU ARE THE DEVIL.
THAT YOU TAKE
MEN'S SOULS.
DID YOU BELIEVE THEM?
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU'RE DEVIL OR NOT.
AS LONG AS YOU WILL GIVE ME
WHAT I NEED ON THIS EARTH.
IT IS TRULY A PLEASURE TO DO BUSINESS
WITH AN ENLIGHTENED MAN, MR. KRUTCHKOV.
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?
FIRST, OBVIOUSLY,
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
ONLY ONE WISH TO A
CUSTOMER. OH, MR. DEMAREST.
I AM NOT USUAL CUSTOMER.
MAYBE NOT,
BUT THERE ARE RULES.
RULES ARE MEANT
TO BE BROKEN.
HELP ME,
AND I HELP YOU.
NOW, WHY WOULD I NEED
HELP? EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP.
EVEN THE DEVIL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? OH, YES,
SIR. JUST TALKING A LITTLE BIT.
DEMAREST.
LET'S GO.
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER,
BABY.
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
WE MEET AGAIN,
MORGANA.
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.
WHERE, EXACTLY,
DO YOU THINK WE MET?
IN THE ART GALLERY.
THAT'S BULLSHIT.
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.
WHY DID YOU CONFESS
TO THE ROBBERY?
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO,
MY DEAR.
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.
I THINK YOU DO.
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
TOO LOUDLY IN HERE, NOW, WOULD WE?
YOU WERE THERE?
INDEED.
HIDING? "HIDDEN," I
THINK, IS A BETTER WORD.
LOOK, YOU'RE TALKING IN CIRCLES.
I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME
A QUESTION?
WHAT HAPPENED TO ERIC?
THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS SHOT?
HE HAD A REGRESSIVE
EXPERIENCE.
NO. NO RIDDLES.
I'M SORRY.
HE'S NO LONGER WITH US.
- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE RAP INSTEAD OF ME?
- ACCESS.
HOW COULD YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO ANYBODY? YOU'RE IN PRISON!
YOU'RE HERE. BESIDES,
THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY,
AND I'VE MANAGED TO GATHER UP
A FEW LIKE-MINDED SOULS.
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING.
I LOVE THAT PART!
WHAT DOES
"FULFILL THE PROPHECY" MEAN?
YOU'LL LEARN THAT
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.
WHAT PROPHECY? AND WHY
ME? WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME?
YOU SET ME FREE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISS?
I'M FINE.
COME ON, ASSHOLE.
COME ON.
PUT IT OVER THERE.
THERE'S THIS GUY.
JACKIE T.
PLAYS IT OFF
LIKE HE'S MY BOY.
BE SHARIN' STUFF, TALK SHIT ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHEN WE GET OUT.
I TELL HIM ABOUT MY STASH,
I TELL HIM ABOUT MY GIRL.
HE GETS OUT. NEXT THING I KNOW THIS FUCKIN'
SANCHO IS RUNNIN' AROUND WITH MY BITCH.
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE. THAT'S NO GOOD.
NO. WE REALLY MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?
YOUR SOUL.
AND A PACK
OF CIGARETTES.
JUST TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?
DONE.
HELLO, BRO.
SEE YOU BEEN SPREADIN'
YOUR HUSTLE AROUND MY HOUSE.
YES.
THAT'S GOOD.
'CAUSE I'M HERE
FOR MY RENT.
YOUR RENT?
MY RENT.
MY PIECE, MY SLICE,
MY BIG.
YOU JUST GOT A NEW PARTNER,
MOTHERFUCKER.
NOT. I PREFER
TO WORK ALONE.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I AM PREPARED TO OFFER YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, HOWEVER.
YOU DON'T OFFER ME SHIT!
I TAKE, AND I TAKE, AND I TAKE!
YES, OF COURSE. WHAT I MEANT TO SAY
WAS, YOU CAN TAKE ANYTHING YOU WISH.
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D
TRADE YOUR SOUL FOR?
MY SOUL? MAN, BUTZ DON'T HAVE NO SOUL.
SHUT UP!
OH, YES, HE DOES.
WHAT'LL IT BE, BROTHER?
POWER? MONEY?
SEX?
ONE MORE WORD OUTTA YOU,
AND I'M GONNA SHOVE MY FIST...
SO FAR DOWN YOUR FUCKIN' THROAT
YOU'RE GONNA SHIT KNUCKLES!
NOBODY DOES BUSINESS
IN MY FUCKIN' HOUSE...
UNLESS I GET MY RENT.
VERY WELL.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
HMM.
DON'T YOU KNOW THESE'LL
KILL YA? YOUR DRUGS!
I WANT YOUR DRUGS. EXACTLY
WHICH DRUGS WOULD YOU LIKE?
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
I JUST WANNA GET WASTED.
WASTED?
WASTED.
FUCKED UP.
TORE UP FROM THE FLOOR UP.
STOMPED RIGHT INTO THE GROUND.
WASTED.
MMM.
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED!
WANNA SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT,
MOTHERFUCKERS? COME ON! LET'S ROCK!
CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR,
BROTHER.
THAT'S HOW HARD YOU CAN
HIT ME? POW, POW!
GET OUTTA HERE!
CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF?
GOT TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BETTER TEMP, ASS.
MMM.
DAMN.
EVERY TIME I HAVE TROUBLE
IN MY HOUSE,
I SEE YOUR UGLY FACE.
NOW, WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?
BAD DRUGS.
OH, YOU'RE
A FUNNY GUY, HUH?
LET'S SEE HOW FUNNY YOU ARE
WITH A WEEK IN THE HOLE!
A WEEK?
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU'VE GOT?
YOU WANT MORE?
YOU GOT IT, MISTER.
I WAS IN A HOLE ONCE
FOR 3,000 YEARS.
THIS SHOULD BE
A BREEZE.
YOU'RE A FUCKIN' NUT CASE. I'M GONNA TAKE
CARE OF YOU. NOW, GET HIS ASS OUTTA HERE!
STUFF HIS ASS
IN THE HOLE!
"ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
AN ALL-POWERFUL JINN...
"LAID WASTE TO THE COURT
OF PERSIA.
"AS HE PREPARED TO SCOURGE
THE EARTH...
"AND USURP THE WORLD
FOR HIS OWN,
THE KING'S ALCHEMIST CREATED
THE STONE OF THE SECRET FIRE."
"BY INCANTATION, THE ALCHEMIST
IMPRISONED THE JINN...
WITHIN THE FIRE-RED OPAL."
FIRE-RED OPAL.
"LEST THE JINN ESCAPE AGAIN
AND BRING ON THE APOCALYPSE,
THE GOD AHURA MAZDA WAS
ENLISTED TO GUARD THE STONE."
OH, MAN.
"GUARD THE STONE AND KEEP THE JINN TRAPPED
WITHIN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WORLDS."
MAN, I FEEL LIKE
I AM LOSING MY MIND.
THE ARTICLE ON THE NET SAYS THERE'S
THIS STONE OF THE SECRET FIRE...
WITH THIS JINN THING
LOCKED INSIDE IT.
A- AND IT'S GUARDED BY THIS GOD,
AHURA MAZDA.
WELL, I FOUND THE JEWEL
INSIDE A STATUE OF AHURA MAZDA.
THE JEWEL BROKE
ON MY BODY.
IS THAT WHAT DEMAREST MEANT
WHEN HE SAID I WOKE HIM?
I MEAN, FROM WHAT?
FROM INSIDE SOME STONE?
AND WHEN I ASKED DEMAREST
WHO HE WAS,
I GOT THIS- THIS FLASH...
OF THIS HELL
AND THIS- THIS THING,
THIS JINN,
STARING AT ME.
EITHER THIS IS SOME KIND OF WEIRD DELUSION,
IN WHICH CASE I'M NOT SURE I'M STANDING HERE,
OR THIS GUY IS FOR REAL.
WELL, IN THIS FLASH,
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS THING
YOU SAW WAS A JINN?
- BECAUSE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE THE THING IN THE ARTICLE.
- THE ARTICLE YOU READ?
- WAIT A MINUTE-
- NO, NO. I'M ASKING BECAUSE...
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT
OF STRESS SINCE ERIC'S DEATH.
YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS GUY. YOU DIDN'T
SIT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM HIM...
AND LOOK IN HIS EYES
AND SEE-
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.
MAYBE IF YOU'D-
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
NO. NO.
MAYBE I SHOULD.
OPEN THREE!
TIME'S UP, DEMAREST.
LET'S GO.
FRONT AND CENTER.
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?
LEAVE HER ALONE.
IS THAT YOUR WISH?
I'M NOT ASKIN' YOU. I'M
TELLIN' YOU. LEAVE HER ALONE.
LIKE YOU LEFT HER ALONE,
FATHER?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS
ON THAT CUTE LITTLE ASS MYSELF.
- YOU WON'T SUCCEED.
- WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?
GOD WILL STOP YOU.
GOD HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.
GOD HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.
BEGONE, SATAN!
I THINK YOU HAVE YOUR DEMONS
MIXED UP, FATHER.
GREGORY, I WANT YOU. GREGORY.
TELL MORGANA
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
GREGORY?
GREGORY, ARE YOU OKAY?
HE'S NOT OF THIS WORLD.
"FIRST THE JINN
MUST GATHER 1,001 SOULS,
"THIS BEING THE ASSYRIAN NUMBER
FOR THE APOCALYPSE.
"HE DOES THIS
BY THE GRANTING OF A WISH.
"THE SOULS ARE HELD
IN A KIND OF PURGATORY...
"UNTIL THE REQUISITE NUMBER ARE
ATTAINED, OR THE JINN FAILS,
"IN WHICH CASE
THE SOULS ARE FREED.
"SHOULD THE JINN SUCCEED,
HE MUST THEN FIND THE HUMAN...

"AND GRANT HIM
THREE WISHES.
"UPON THE GRANTING
OF THE THIRD WISH,
"THE JINN MAY NOW BRING FORTH
HIS RACE INTO OUR REALITY...
"AND OVERWHELM HUMANITY,
AS PROPHESIED
BY THE ANCIENTS."
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
YOU ASKED ME BEFORE
IF I BELIEVED IN THE DEVIL.
- I DO NOW.
- SO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE.
IF IT ISN'T, THANK GOD.
IF IT IS...
GOD HELP US.
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY HE'D WANT TO GO TO PRISON.
ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THIS POWER
HE HAS.
A LOT OF WISHING
GOING ON IN THERE.
HE'S JUST BIDING HIS TIME,
COLLECTING HIS SOULS.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
MMM.
UH... ALL RIGHT.
HERE.
THANKS. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO AVOID
DEMAREST AT ALL COSTS.
YEAH, WELL, THAT...
MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,
PLEASE DON'T WISH
FOR ANYTHING.
THAT SHOULD BE EASY.
TWELVE-STEP PROGRAM FOR
"WISH-AHOLICS"? YEAH.
IT'S CALLED FAITH.
NO. NO, I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THIS WORLD,
AND I DAMN WELL
BETTER GET HIM OUT.
THE BOOK SAYS HE CAN ONLY
BE RETURNED TO HIS OWN REALM...
BY SOMEONE WHO'S... PURE.
ALL RIGHT! SO I GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF A PROBLEM THERE.
GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON IT.
HMM. WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU WORK ON IT
FROM YOUR END,
AND I'LL WORK ON IT
FROM MINE.
PURIFY MY SOUL.
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.
WHY ARE YOU SO QUIET
TODAY, MY FRIEND?
RUNNING OUT OF
CUSTOMERS?
IT APPEARS I'VE EXHAUSTED
MY CONSUMER BASE.
OH. SO THE REST
OF THOSE MORONS...
ARE NOT SO STUPID
THAT THEY LOOK.
ON THE CONTRARY, THEY'RE MORE
STUPID THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.
CHECKMATE.
WELL, TIME TO BLOW
THIS POPSICLE STAND.
AMAZING! I WOKE UP
WITH THE SAME IDEA.
SHALL WE GO, THEN?
YES. SURE.
HOW?
WALK OUT THE FRONT GATE.
JUST LIKE THAT?
YES.
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WISH IT.
- YOU SAID I GET TWO WISHES. REMEMBER?
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
YOU MAKE A WISH.
I GET YOUR SOUL.
AFTER THAT, WE'LL SEE.
GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF HERE. SORRY, SIR.
YOU'RE A NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRL.
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
AND DADDY GONNA TEACH
YOU SOME RESPECT!
EVER SINCE YOU BEEN HERE,
THERE'S BEEN NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE.
THERE'S BEEN FOUR MURDERS. THERE'S
BEEN AN INCREASE OF CONTRABAND.
THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF DISCIPLINE.
YOU'RE NOT FOOLIN' ME, MAN!
YOU THINK
THIS SHIT'S FUNNY?
I GOT A PLACE THEY CALL HELL THAT'LL MAKE
YOUR WEEK IN THE HOLE LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK.
BEEN THERE. OH, YOU
THINK YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY.
WHEN I CLOSE THEM DOORS, GONNA HAVE YOU
CRYIN' FOR YOUR MAMA LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.
SOUNDS GREAT, SIR,
BUT I'VE MADE OTHER PLANS.
YOU JUST GOT A MONTH
OF HELL.
I'M GONNA KEEP YOU THERE TILL
THE RATS EAT YOUR DAMN EYES OUT.
IS THAT YOUR WISH,
SIR?
THAT'S MY ORDER.
I TELL YOU WHAT MY
WISH IS. I'M ALL EARS.
I WISH I COULD SLOW DANCE
WITH YOU...
FOR ONE MINUTE, ALONE,
COMPTON STYLE.
DONE.
OH, MY GOD.
SHALL WE DANCE?
KRUTCHKOV.
YES, SIR! KRUTCHKOV, HOW BADLY
DO YOU WANNA LEAVE THIS PRISON?
NO, SIR.
I AM HAPPY HERE.
YES. I AM HAPPY. EVERYTHING
IS FINE, YOU KNOW?
AMERICAN PRISON IS THE BEST
IN THE WORLD.
IS IT YOUR WISH TO BLOW
THIS POPSICLE STAND?
DEMAREST?
MAKE YOUR WISH.
ARE YOU FUCKING TOO MUCH.
YES.
OPEN SESAME.
MORGANA!
MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?
I HAD TO CAST OUT
MY OWN DEVILS FIRST.
- LOOK, HE ESCAPED.
- WHAT! WHEN?
THIS MORNING. THINK HE HAS ALL
THE SOULS? IS THAT WHY HE GOT OUT?
MAYBE HE NEEDS MORE
AND CAN'T FIND ANY TAKERS.
A THOUSAND'S A PRETTY BIG
NUMBER. WELL, NOT BIG ENOUGH.
THE BOOKS SAY THAT WHEN THE APOCALYPSE IS
NEAR, THE NATURE OF THE WORLD WILL CHANGE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET. I DON'T
THINK ANYTHING THIS GUY DOES IS RANDOM.
TELL ME. HOW DID HE
ESCAPE? THEY DON'T KNOW YET.
THIS GUARD WAS KILLED.
HE WAS MUTILATED.
HE LEFT WITH THIS OTHER GUY, THIS RUSSIAN MAN
- WAIT A MINUTE.
A RUSSIAN. WHAT WAS
HIS NAME? I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S GOTTA BE IN THE
PAPERS BY NOW. LET'S GO.
HERE IT IS.
OSIP KRUTCHKOV.
I KNOW THAT NAME.
KRUTCHKOV. HE MURDERED
TWO MEN IN MY PARISH.
HE LIVES HERE? I CAN'T SAY. I
USED TO HANG OUT AT HIS CLUB.
UM, SIBERIA CLUB?
SIBERIA?
THE PLACE ON THIRD.
YEAH.
DRINK.
NO, THANK YOU.
COME ON.
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF DEVIL ARE YOU?
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE DEVIL,
THIS SON OF A BITCH.
HE CAN GIVE YOU
ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT.
MONEY, PAVEL?
HMM? HUH?
YOU WANT-
YOU WANT A BIG DICK,
MY LITTLE FRIEND MISHA?
HUH? YOU WANT IT?
HE CAN GIVE IT TO YOU.
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT, I TOLD YOU!
MISHA, I SAID
TO GET OUT OF HERE!
THIS FUCKIN' SON OF BITCH!
GET OUT OF HERE!
- NOTHING.
- JUST...
YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN.
WHY ARE YOU
SO AFRAID OF PUSHKIN?
EVERYBODY IS
AFRAID OF PUSHKIN.
HE'S A BIG BOSS.
I DESPISE PUSHKIN!
MAKE ME BIG BOSS.
GET RID OF THIS
FUCKING PUSHKIN.
I WISH I WANT TO BE
BIG BOSS.
YOU'VE ALREADY
HAD YOUR WISH.
ONE MORE, PLEASE.
SORRY.
THERE ARE RULES
NOT EVEN I CAN BREAK.
COME WITH ME.
PLEASE.
COME.
MMM.
IS THIS TRUE?
ABSOLUTELY.
JUST ASK.
WHY?
WHAT YOU GET FROM THIS?
THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU
ACHIEVE YOUR END.
YOU ARE THE MOST
INTERESTING CHARACTER.
YES, I AM.
THERE IS NOTHING I NEED. SURELY
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANT.
FAME, FORTUNE, POWER.
FORTUNE AND POWER
I ALREADY HAVE.
FAME I DON'T NEED.
EXCUSE ME.
MAYBE A WOMAN
YOU COULDN'T GET.
SOME OBJECT
OF GREAT VALUE.
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
AN ENEMY TO DISAPPEAR.
I DON'T NEED YOU FOR THAT.
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.
MOUSTAFA!
I TOLD YOU! NEVER MENTION
HIS NAME IN MY PRESENCE!
NATHANIEL CAN
GET TO HIM, REALLY.
SOMEBODY WHO'S OFFENDED YOU.
SOMEONE YOU CAN'T TOUCH.
MOUSTAFA'S GETTING
OUT OF CHECHNYA.
WHAT COULD YOU DO
AGAINST MOUSTAFA?
ANYTHING YOU WISH.
I WANT HIS HEAD.
CONSIDER IT DONE.
MOUSTAFA!
GET OUT OF HERE!
I'LL KILL YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER!
TAKE HIM OUT OF HERE.
MOUSTAFA! MOUSTAFA!
I DID IT!
ON HIS WISH I DID IT!
HA-HA!
OH, NOW I AM THE BOSS,
NUMBER ONE!
WHAT?
I GOT WHAT I WANT.
YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT.
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE? ONE MORE SOUL.
ONE MORE SOUL?
I NEED 800 MORE SOULS,
AND I'M GROWING IMPATIENT.
WAIT, WAIT.
GO ON THE STREET AND TAKE
THEM. YOU'RE POWERFUL.
I CAN ONLY ACT WHEN
I'M WISHED TO DO SO,
BUT THAT WILL CHANGE
VERY SOON.
YOU NEED SOULS.
I HAVE SUCH A GREAT
PLACE FOR YOU.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MORGANA.
DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD KILL ME?
EVIL NEVER DIES.
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
YOU DESIRE.
YOUR DEAD FRIEND ERIC
ALIVE AGAIN.
NO.
THERE WILL COME A TIME,
SOON,
WHEN I WILL CALL UPON YOU TO FULFILL THE PROPHECY
- YOU WHO WOKE ME.
THREE WISHES
YOU WILL MAKE.
THEN MY KINGDOM
WILL REIGN ON THIS EARTH.
FOR NOW,
THIS WISH
I GIVE YOU FREELY...
SO YOU MAY KNOW ITS JOY.
TELL ME YOUR DESIRE,
CHILD.
I SHALL GRANT IT.
SOULS,
KRUTCHKOV.
I NEED SOULS.
GOD, FORGIVE ME.
GOD FORGIVES ALL SIN.
SOME SINS
ARE TOO GREAT,
EVEN FOR GOD.
NO SIN IS TOO GREAT
FOR HIS FORGIVENESS.
I KILLED
AN INNOCENT MAN.
I LEFT TWO CHILDREN
FATHERLESS.
I HAVE BLOOD ON MY HANDS
I CAN NEVER WASH OUT.
THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB
CAN CLEANSE ALL SINS.
NO, NOT MINE!
I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THIS WORLD.
AND I'M TOO WEAK.
I'M TOO IMPURE
TO GET HIM OUT.
I PRAY TO GOD
FOR FORGIVENESS,
BUT I CAN'T
HEAR HIS VOICE.
MORGANA,
LISTEN TO ME.
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS.
IF IT'S HIS WILL THAT
YOU SERVE HIM, SO BE IT.
I SAW HIS TRUE FACE.
THE FACE OF GOD?
THE JINN.
I FOUND DEMAREST AND...
I TRIED TO KILL HIM.
MY GOD.
AND WHEN I SHOT HIM,
HE CHANGED.
THOSE PICTURES
OF THE JINN-
THERE'S NO WAY
TO FIGHT HIM.
FOR US, NO.
FOR GOD,
THROUGH US-
HEY!
COME IN.
IT'S OKAY.
A PRIEST CAN'T DO YOU
ANY GOOD, GIRLIE.
- HE'S GONE.
- WHERE?
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
TELL YOU THAT, FATHER.
WHY NOT?
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF?
I MADE A PLEDGE.
YOU MADE A PLEDGE?
YOU SIT BEFORE GOD, AND YOU
TELL ME YOU MADE A PLEDGE...
WITH THIS-
THIS EVIL?
I DON'T SEE GOD
IN THIS ROOM.
I JUST SEE
A POOR PRIEST...
AND A PATHETIC
LITTLE GIRL.
YOU WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD? I
SHOW YOU HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD!
JUST- JUST PUT
THE GUN DOWN.
IF SHE'S DEAD, SHE CAN'T
WISH THIS WORLD INTO HELL.
- HE'S RIGHT.
- NO! PUT THE GUN DOWN.
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP HIM.
I CAN'T LET YOU!
PUT THE GUN DOWN.
AAH!
NO!
THERE'S
NOTHING THERE.
OH, HE HAS
OTHER PLANS FOR YOU.
HOW MANY SOULS?
HOW MANY SOULS DOES HE HAVE?
DID HE SAY?
YOU MADE A WISH, RIGHT?
YOU WANT TO SPEND ETERNITY
IN HIS HELL?
THEN HELP US!
HELP YOURSELF!
HE SAID...
HE NEEDS 800 MORE.
THAT GIVES US SOME TIME, RIGHT? YEAH.
NOT WHERE HE'S GOING.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE
REPRESENTING OUR...
EASTERN EUROPEAN PARTNERS
WHILE YOU'RE OUT HERE.
YES, INDEED.
QUITE SO.
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN
THE GAMING INDUSTRY, MR. DEMAREST?
OH, YES.
WHOA!
CONGRATULATIONS, TEX.
THANK YOU,
PARTNER.
YEAH, WE LIKE
FOLKS TO WIN.
ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES OUR
OTHER GUESTS TO BET IS GOOD FOR US.
SINCE THE HOUSE
HAS THE ADVANTAGE,
EVENTUALLY
THEY ALL LOSE.
WHAT A WONDERFUL BUSINESS.
YEAH, WE LIKE
TO THINK SO.
IN FACT,
YOU MIGHT SAY...
THE CASINO WISHES EVERYONE
THE BEST OF LUCK.
THE CASINO WISHES
EVERYONE THE BEST OF LUCK?
MOST ASSUREDLY.
HOW NICE.
MR. AND MRS. LEE.
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S THE SUITE?
COME ON, SEVEN.
COME ON, SEVEN!
KA-CHING.
HELLO?
THIS IS
OSIP KRUTCHKOV.
I AM SO SORRY.
I MUST TALK TO YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU MUST GO TO HIM BEFORE
HE GETS ALL HIS SOULS.
I HAVE PURCHASED
YOU A TICKET.
PLEASE, I BEG YOU.
YOU MUST GO, NOW.
YEAH, RIGHT.
I ALSO NEED ONE
FOR FATHER GREGORY.
BOTH TICKETS WILL BE
WAITING AT THE AIRPORT.
GOOD-BYE, MORGANA,
AND THANK YOU.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE CAN DO THIS? YEAH.
IT SAYS HERE THAT THE KING'S
ALCHEMIST FROM PERSIA...
GOT THE JINN BACK INTO THE
GEM THROUGH AN INCANTATION.
NOW, WHAT INCANTATION?
"AND AS IT WAS PROPHESIED, THE
ALCHEMIST TOOK THE STONE UNTO HIS HAND,
"AS A WOMAN PURE OF HEART TAKES
THE LIGHT OF GOD UNTO HER SOUL,
"AND SPOKE THE WORDS
NIB SUGAROTH BAHEIM,
UPON WHICH THE JINN WAS AGAIN
IMPRISONED WITHIN THE OPAL." THERE IT IS.
SO YOU FIGURE IF YOU JUST
SAY THOSE WORDS-
THE JINN IS JUST
GONNA DISAPPEAR?
WELL, HE GOES BACK
INSIDE THE OPAL.
BUT IF THE KING'S ALCHEMIST CAN DO
IT, THEN SO CAN WE. WHY CAN'T WE?
BECAUSE HE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.
AT LEAST
YOU'RE PURE OF HEART.
LOOK, GREGORY,
THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END,
AND YOU'RE GONNA STOP THE JINN
BY USING A QUOTATION...
FROM A BOOK YOU BOUGHT
AT THE SPELL-CHECKER?
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?
MORGANA, I REALLY DON'T THINK
THIS IS THE WAY TO HEAVEN.
DON'T BE TOO SURE.
MAGIC.
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOIN' ON?
I DON'T KNOW,
MR. FARRALON.
I CLAIM THAT
WHICH IS OWED.
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
MORGANA,
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
AAH!
IT'S OVER.
HE HAS ALL THE SOULS.
IF YOU STAY CALM,
NO ONE WILL GET HURT.
THEY ALL WANTED
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.
AND THAT'S
WHAT THEY GOT.
ALL RIGHT, IT'S SHOW TIME. LET'S GO.
THREE WISHES, MORGANA,
AND I SHALL REIGN.
COME IN.
I TRUST YOU DIDN'T FIND THE
DISTURBANCE DOWNSTAIRS TOO UPSETTING.
IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND
IF YOUR KINGDOM COMES?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY, FATHER.
"WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND."
DO YOU LIKE
TO GAMBLE?
DEPENDS ON
WHAT'S AT STAKE.
THE CASINO WOULD BE HAPPY
TO OFFER YOU UNLIMITED CREDIT...
TO PLAY THE GAME
OF YOUR CHOICE.
I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'LL DO VERY WELL.
I CAN FEEL IT.
MATTER OF FACT,
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.
SAVE YOUR GAMES FOR
THE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.
HMM.
SO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE A WISH?
THREE, TO BE EXACT.
ALL RIGHT.
I WISH...
YOU WERE GONE
FOREVER!
POOF!
HMM.
STILL HERE.
A WISH CANNOT CHANGE
THAT WHICH IS ETERNAL.
PLEASE WISH AGAIN.
YOU CAN DO BETTER.
I WISH- I WISH YOU BACK INTO
THE STONE OF THE SECRET FIRE.
I SEE YOU'VE DONE
YOUR HOMEWORK.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
AFTER ALL,
I AM THE WISHMASTER HERE.
SO ANY WISHES
PERTAINING TO ME...
ARE CIRCUMSCRIBED
BY THE PROPHECY.
SO, WE HAVE
DONE OUR HOMEWORK.
DO NOT PLAY WITH FORCES
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
OR YOU WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.
YOU DON'T
FRIGHTEN US.
GOD'S ALREADY SENT YOU
ONCE BACK TO HELL.
OH, PLEASE.
NOT THAT
OLD STORY AGAIN.
HELL IS YOUR WORLD,
NOT MINE.
IN GOD'S NAME, I COMMAND
YOU OUT OF THIS WORLD.
I WISH YOU INTO HELL,
DEMAREST.
GOTCHA.
WELCOME TO MY WORLD,
MORGANA.
WHERE'S GREGORY?
WHERE HE'S ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE.
BEHOLD, THE MAN.
WHAT GOOD
IS YOUR FAITH NOW?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE
UNDONE, CHILD. JUST ASK.
LET HIM GO.
LET HIM GO, PLEASE.
IS THAT YOUR WISH?
NO.
THEN WATCH HIM
SUFFER.
AAH!
I WISH YOU
TO RELEASE HIM.
DONE.
OH, GOD!
GREGORY!
OH, GOD.
YOU SAID
YOU'D RELEASE HIM!
AND SO I SHALL.
GREGORY?
YOU BASTARD!
TWO MORE WISHES.
GO FUCK YOURSELF
IN HELL.
MAKE YOUR WISHES.
NEVER.
YOU TAX MY PATIENCE,
CHILD.
I WISH THERE WAS
NO EVIL IN THE WORLD.
EVIL IS THE HALF
OF A PERFECT SPHERE.
TRY AGAIN. TELL ME HOW TO STOP YOU!
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THAT.
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME NOW,
AND YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF!
MAKE YOUR WISH!
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.
ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH DAY.
HMM.
I CAN SEE HOW...
THIS COULD GET A LITTLE
DEPRESSING IN HERE, COULDN'T IT?
THIS PLACE ISN'T EXACTLY...
HAPPY.
I KNOW.
WHAT WE NEED IS A MORE
WISH-PROVOKING ENVIRONMENT.
ROSS.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
FIRST A RUN ON THE HOUSE.
NOW 200 PEOPLE DROP DEAD
ALL AT ONCE?
WHAT'S NEXT? FROGS
AND LOCUSTS? COULD BE.
WE'RE FINISHED!
NOT YET, ROSS.
WHAT WE NEED IS SOME MORE
ACTION. GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
DON'T YOU WISH WE HAD
SOME REAL ACTION?
NO! NO, DON'T!
WHO'S SHE?
AN ACQUAINTANCE.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
HE'S THE DEVIL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
ROSS?
NO, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
IT'S A TRICK.
YOU KNOW, NATHANIEL,
I THINK I'VE HAD ABOUT ALL
THE ACTION THAT I CAN HANDLE.
I JUST WISH I COULD SEE THIS
NIGHTMARE COME TO AN END.
NO!
HURRY UP!
HELP!
LOOK OUT!
THIS PLACE IS DAMNED!
EVERYONE OUT!
TOO BAD.
YOU JUST CRAPPED OUT.
AHH.
OOH!
DO YOU WISH
TO SEE MORE?
NO.
THEN END IT.
MAKE YOUR WISHES.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO ASK FOR.
ASK FOR YOUR
HEART'S DESIRES.
A MILLION DOLLARS?
A BIRD'S NEST?
TO SEE YOUR LOVER PRIEST
ONE LAST TIME?
YOU SAID, "FULFILL THE
PROPHECY." WHAT PROPHECY?
I HAVE NO MORE TIME, CHILD.
YOU TOLD ME I'D KNOW THE
ANSWER WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT.
IT IS WRITTEN,
"THAT ONE WHO
WAKES THE JINN...
"SHALL HAVE
THREE WISHES.
"UPON GRANTING
ALL THREE,
THE RACE OF JINN
SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH."
AND AS IT WAS PROPHESIED,
"THE ALCHEMIST TOOK
THE STONE UNTO HIS HAND,
"AS A WOMAN PURE OF HEART TAKES
THE LIGHT OF GOD UNTO HER SOUL,
I WISH THE MAN I SHOT
WAS ALIVE AGAIN.
DONE.
AH. DADDY! DADDY!
THAT'S GOOD.
OH, GREGORY.
HE'S GONE.
