Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
The fence keeps bending in like that,
those walkers are coming over it.
That veterinary college...
Bags, tubes, claps, connectors.
All right, let's roll.
I can't let you do this.
There are
people in there suffering.
Yes.
I won't have you there.
Henry, I need you to calm down.
We're trying to help.
No--!
Drink some of that.
Both of you.
Some council meeting, huh?
We're two members short.
Hershel: I think we should make some
new rules before they get back.
I hereby declare we have
spaghetti Tuesdays
every Wednesday.
First we have to find
some spaghetti.
You okay to take over?
Every five to six
seconds, squeeze.
You start feeling lightheaded,
grab somebody else
to take over.
You want to help me
go on my rounds?
Yeah.
Sure.
How long will that
keep him alive?
Just as long
as we're willing to do it.
As long as it takes.
No. Not here.
Help me get him on this.
Okay, but in a couple
of hours when Henry's dead--
- Glenn.
- How are we gonna get his body
down the stairs,
across the cell block
and through those doors
without anyone noticing?
If that happens-- if--
you're gonna help me.
And what if I'm gone?
Shut up and help me
get him on this.
What are you doing?
We're taking Mr. Jacobson
to a quieter place.
Go get my copy of "Tom
Sawyer" from my room.
I want you to
read it by tonight.
- We all got jobs to do.
-
- That one's yours.
- I won't finish it.
Why?
It's gonna get too dark.
Well,
give it your best try.
-
-
You haven't had to do
this yet, have you?
There was one late last night.
Sasha did it.
People don't need to see it.
I don't want them to.

Where's Glenn?
He said he would meet me.
He's resting.
Is he okay?
He was helping me
and he got tired, that's all.
- If you need help, I can help you.
- I don't.
I was just keeping
him occupied.
Keeping his mind
on helping people.
I can come in there
and help you.
No, you don't need to.
- You can rest, dad--
- No!
How's Bethy?
She's okay.
Daddy, you look so tired.
I am.
But I'm fine.
They could return
any minute now.
It's hard in here.
But we're holding it together.
We're gonna make it.
Don't you believe that?
Of course.
Just hold it together
a little longer.
Please?
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
Thank you for stopping her.
We need someone out there
taking care of things.
If she saw me,
couldn't keep her out.
I know you didn't
want to lie to her.
I wasn't lying.
Look at you.
You're resting.
I'm almost done down here.
Why don't you go lie down?
Carl, Judith, are they okay?
Yeah.
Where's Carol?
Glenn, Hershel, Sasha?
Yeah, it's bad, but they're fighting it.
Daryl's not back yet.
Rick.
Rick, where's Carol?
It was her.
She killed Karen and David.
She was trying to stop
it from spreading.
Tyreese is gonna
be back here soon,
so I didn't think
she should be here.
And I couldn't have her here.
She has a car, supplies,
she'll figure it out.
I'll tell your dad.
Don't tell anyone else yet.
Okay.
Would you have
brought her back?
- She said she did it?
- Yeah.
Then you were right
to send her away.
I don't know if I could have.
You could have, Maggie.
You've done harder things.
Don't doubt yourself.
We don't get to anymore.
Rick, the cluster's getting bigger
than the one that took the fence down.
- We need to do something.
- We will.
Carl?
Carl.
Carl?
You okay?
I was gonna ask you that.
- We're fine.
- No one's sick?
You didn't have to do anything?
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.
And Judith?
She's with Beth.
Good.
Found some food on the run.
There's a bunch of
fruit leather in there.
Have everybody brush
their teeth after.
- Can we come out soon?
- Not just yet.
Dad, I was around you when you
were in the middle of it.
And I was around Patrick.
I didn't get it.
I can help you.
Thanks, but I need
you to stay here.
I will.
But, Dad, you can't
keep me from it.
From what?
From what always happens.
Yeah.
Maybe.
But I think it's my job to try.
Thank you.
No problem.
Let's have a look at you.
Doctors make
the worst patients.
Not everyone gets to live.
End stage
is a point that no one
comes back from
or they--
or they can't.
That's where I am.
No, you need to focus on
the ones that can make it.
I made some more IVs.
If you're not ready
to lose one,
you're gonna lose them all.
It's like turning
off a light--
it'll happen one
after the other.
And they don't just die.
We can hold on.
Caleb.
Caleb.
After what happened
in the other cell block,
when I came in here,
I brought these.
Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.
When we are,
it'll be too late.
You don't understand.
You have a chance.
This is it after this.
I'm not giving up on anyone.
Not yet.
Just make sure everyone's
doors are shut.
Caleb...
Just make sure!
Caleb, you've got
to let me look at you.
Okay, Hershel.
Have a look.
Drink the tea I left you.
Gonna be back to check
on you in an hour.
Everyone,
get back in your cells.
Go on, get back in your cells.
Let's get him on this.
Go rest.
Can you make it to your cell?
Rick:
Third one we've lost.
We're burning them
behind the blocks.
Burning them.
That's what it's come to.
Are you okay?
I talked to him yesterday
about Steinbeck.
He told me a quote.
"A sad soul
can kill quicker
than a germ."
That's exactly why I didn't want
them all to see what happens.
I know they know,
but I didn't want them
to see it right now.
They're seeing you, Hershel.
They see you
keep going.
Even after all the choices
keep getting taken away.
When we get past this thing...
it's not gonna be like
how it was, is it?
No.
Was that denial?
Not seeing things
for how they were?
No.
You just caught a break.
You needed some time.
You got some.
You got lucky.
We all did.
I still think there's a plan.
I still believe
there's a reason.
You think it's all a test?
Life was always a test, Rick.
I need to talk
to you about Carol.
Come on.
Come on, Sasha.
You know how to fight.
I just talked to your dad.
He looks good,
all things considered.
If Carl were sick, would
you be up there with him?
If I thought I could help.
You don't think I can help?
-
- Damn.
I'm just glad
you're out here with me.
Welcome back.
I passed out?
You were dehydrated.
Being a hero takes
a lot out of you.
You should know.
I thought you were an
idiot to come in here.
I mean, I was sure
you were just gonna be
a dead foolish man.
I can't tell
if that's a compliment.
I don't know what I'm saying.
I must have hit my head.
I don't believe in magic
or luck.
I do the math
and I don't gamble.
But I don't know
if I'd be here right now
if you weren't so damn stupid.
You know what?
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.
Hersh--
Hershel--
I'll check on you
in a little while.
How is he?
He's sleeping.
You should get
some rest yourself.
I don't want to leave him
in case he wakes up.
- Want me to take a look at him?
- No.
Just let him sleep.
-
- Hershel!
Hershel!
Everyone stay in your cells.
No.
-
-
The fence is more important.
We need to keep it standing.
I got this.
- You can't do this alone.
- I know. Go.
-
-
Lizzy:
Down here, away from Glenn.
Come on.
Come on, boy.
Come on, Henry.
Just a little more.
Carl?
Carl...?
Carl.
I heard gunshots.
I need your help.
Lizzie: Come on.
Down here, Henry.
Keep following me.
Come here.
A little further.
Henry, come on--
- You okay?
- I called him nice.
He didn't scratch Glenn.
I thought maybe he listens.
- Lizzy, where is Glenn?
- His cell.
Dad!
Dad! Open the door!
Get back in there.
You two stay put in here.
Hold on, Glenn.
Hold on.
Hershel!
Caleb.
Caleb, we need the gun.
Think they're okay?
If things were going bad, we
would have heard more shots.
Maggie would have gotten us.
We have to do this.
Let's do it.
- I got it.
- Let me help.
All right, set it down.
All right.
Wait!
Run!
Dad, come on!
Come on!
Dad, what do we do?
Maybe I could back the bus
up against the fence.
Will it hold?
Come on.
Pockets.
Here.
- Got it?
- Yep.
- All right, listen to me.
- Carl: All right.
Magazine goes in here.
Release is here.
Make sure it latches.
Pull back the operating rod
- and rounds feed up.
-
Keep squeezing the trigger
for rapid fire, okay?
- All right.
- You shoot or you run.
Don't let 'em get close, okay?
-
-
Back off!
Hold on, Glenn.
- We have something.
-
We still have it.
Son of a bitch.
-
-
Daddy!
No! You could hit the bag.
We need it for Glenn.
- Where is he?
- He's up here. Cell 100.
He's turning blue!
- Dad.
- Roll him on his back.
- Dad.
-
Hold his arms down.
Come on, son.
Come on.
You know how this works.
Just relax.
Stay with us.
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I didn't want you in here.
I know.
I had to.
Just like you.
Daddy.
I told you to stay put.
Is it over?
I hope so, honey.
Dad...
everything's gonna be okay.
- Sasha? How's Sasha?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
Daryl: Well, get in there.
We got this.
Dad...?
They're back now.
Go rest.
Need some help with that?
No.
Do your thing.
Hey.
You didn't wake me up.
I thought I'd let you sleep in.
- I should help.
- Good.
I've got to go talk to Daryl.
Right now?
No.
Soon. Soon.
- How's Glenn doing?
- He made it through the night.
He's breathing on his own now.
Maggie and Bob are with him.
He seems stable enough
for me to get some air.
- He's a tough son of a bitch.
- He is.
You're a tough son of a bitch.
- I am.
- How about Carol?
No. Talk to Rick
about her.
She's okay, just talk to him.
You want to come?
Hell, yeah.
