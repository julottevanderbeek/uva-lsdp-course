Leave me alone...
please.
Stop!
In time of mourning.
we find comfort
in the words
of the psalmists.
The Psalm of David.
the 23rd...
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness
for His Name's sake.
Yea. Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death.
I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me:
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.
Thou preparest
a table before me
in the presence
of mine enemies:
Thou anointest
my head with oil:
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow thee all the days...
It's gonna rain.
Maybe we should just go home.
The reception is inside. I don't think
weather's gonna be a factor.
Yeah. It's just seeing
everyone after so long...
curious Kira...
I said. "Well. Something's
wrong with that guy. "
But you guys were friends.
They need you.
That's what matters.
I guess you should
go talk to her.
We should talk
to her.
Kira.
Well. Uh...
no sign of Sid...
not surprising.
Maybe something came up.
Yeah. Kinko's must be
really busy tonight.
So he doesn't have
some big law-firm job.
- He's our friend.
- Ah. Sid.
- Sid.
- Mm.
Hi. Sorry I missed
Dev's funeral.
It was crazy
at work.
We're just glad
you could make it.
- Thanks. Man. Miss Mitchel.
- Nice to see you. Sid.
How are you?
Hmm?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Where were you?
You know...
I'm gonna go.
Why?!
I just... I just
don't feel comfortable.
- Okay. Uh. Let me say goodbye and...
- No no no.
Listen. I want
you to stay.
They're your friends.
They need you. But uh...
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah...
- I'm fine.
- Okay. Won't be long.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
- Hey.
- Hey. How have you been?
- Good.
- Nice to see you. Hello.
It's good
to see you guys.
You know. I really miss hanging out
together. Having a few drinks...
That's 'cause everyone
picked up your bill.
I could've claimed you
as a dependent in college.
I'm just saying we took care
of each other then.
And then we didn't.
Come on. Guys.
college doesn't last forever.
- You're free to get married.
- You hear that. Kira?
- We're free to get married.
- I'll keep that in mind.
Okay. Ahem.
Who's taking me home?
Home?
It's like 8:00.
It's 11:00. I've got work tomorrow.
Anyways. This place is closing.
All right. How about we go
someplace else?
- A bar?
- How about a cemetery?
Mm-hmm. Did I mention
I have work tomorrow?
No. Serious. Guys. I mean.
since I missed Dev's funeral.
I thought it would be cool
if we went back. You know... together.
- Mm-hmm.
- Kira?
I don't know.
It's cold and about to rain.
And a cemetery...
isn't that a little weird?
No. What's weird
is we haven't been
in the same room together for years
and the best we can do for Dev
- Is to have a few drinks.
- Sid?
You know what?
I didn't miss Dev's funeral
because of work.
I just didn't go.
You think Dev would've wanted us
sitting around. Crying over him
- Like this?
- What do you want us to do?
Say goodbye together.
We did that...
it's called a funeral.
I won't expect you
to understand.
Guess I'll see you guys
the next time one of us dies.
I didn't do anything.
I swear.
- Harris?
- Yeah.
- Hi. Sid.
- What are you guys doing here?
We're doing what you said...
saying goodbye.
Well. Let's celebrate.
I got strawberry.
That's what we were
afraid of... champagne.
All right. Let's go.
To Devin.
You'll always be with us. Dev.
We love you.
Rest in peace. Dev.
. ' A shadow sits
upon your... '
. ' Peace of mind... '
Whoa-whoa. Easy.
Slow down there. Man.
you're gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
If I don't take a walk.
I'm gonna pass out.
- Wanna come?
- Yeah.
Oh-hh. look.
someone left you a card.
Do you mind
if I read it?
Allison? No. She-she...
she's good.
She supports me.
We have goals.
We're even taking it
to the next step.
The next...
Jesus. Harris Mitchel's
gonna be a dad.
Well. Not yet. But we're. Uh...
we're trying.
- That's the best part. Right?
- Mm.
Uh. So...
does your wife
still hate me?
She doesn't hate you.
She's scared of you.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Scared of what?
Well.
maybe she thinks we got something
going on we don't.
Do we?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- Why aren't you stopping me?
Hey. Where are
you guys?
Oh. Hey.
There you are.
So. Guys. Check this out.
I'm hanging out with Dev
and I find this card
on his tombstone. Right?
and I'm... and I'm reading it
and I'm like.
"Damn. This is so what
we're about tonight!"
You know. What we're
doing here.
Oh God. You're gonna
break your neck.
Right.
So without further ado.
I'd like to read
a few words for Devin
and all the other dead people out there
tonight.
"O joyful. O delighted.
O fortunate one!
Weep no more
this departed son.
Read these words
and sound thy voice.
Revel and sing!
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul
on their resting spot. "
Who's sent that?
It doesn't say.
Boy. Dance on
their resting spot?
- Whoo-whoo!
- Dance on their resting spot.
Whatever. Man.
I'm saying it's about living for today.
You can't dance
on someone's grave.
Don't listen to him.
I think it's cool.
"Rejoice!
Rejoice!
Life's for the living.
not the dead.
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.
So dance ye soul...
...on their resting spot. "
. ' I feel so high at night. '
. ' I wanna take a ride. '
- . ' To the other side... '
- Whoo!
. ' The other side of town.
no need to slow down. '
. ' Then I wake up
and I'm all right. '
. ' I was out on her bed.
I said. '
- . ' Ooh. Baby. I thought I was dead... '
- Yeah!
Whoo-whoo.
Whoo!
Come on. Wake up!
Glad I didn't
wait up.
I'm sorry... started talking
about work. Life. Death.
old times.
Mm.
The usual topics
after too much wine.
Way too much.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna
skip work today.
You sure they'll be able
to practice law?
You haven't missed a day
since you've been there.
I'm sure they'll
do just fine.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.
Oh. Good morning.
Sammy.
You hungry?
Let's go eat.
What is it. What is it?
Tsk-tsk.
Sammy.
Hello?
Hello?
I submitted that
evidence two weeks ago
through
Judge Wayan.
Yes yes. Yes.
I'll be right there.
Did you. Uh.
call what's-his-name?
Yesterday. He said it's an old house
with old pipes.
- Then since it's not an emergency...
- Blah blah blah.
- Blah blah blah.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
- See you.
Bye.
- Ahem.
- Hi. This is Kira. You know what to do.
Kira. It's Harris
calling you back.
Everything is okay.
Bye.
Hello?
Harris?
Harris?
Harris?!
Harris?!
Harris?
- Did you hear her?
- Who?
I feel like I'm
losing my mind.
Baby. What's wrong?
What happened
that night...
after I left
the funeral?
I told you... we sat around
and talked.
So nothing happened
between you and Kira?
Me and Kira?
No!
You know what? She's been calling
ever since that night.
I see her name on the caller ID
and when I answer.
- She hangs up.
- Maybe something is wrong.
Of course there's something wrong...
she's back in our life again!
Listen to me.
She's been calling me too.
I haven't seen or heard
from her since the funeral.
You've been acting strange
since then too.
And then all this... all this stuff
around the house started happening.
- The pipes?
- No. Other things... the doors.
There's tapping.
And... and then
there's voices.
I just don't feel safe.
Oh. Baby.
When did you
learn Chopin. Hon?
Great.
- Hi. Honey.
- Hey.
Oh. How's
the alarm going?
It's finished.
- Looks good.
- Yeah.
Where are you going?
The cat's talking.
Harris?
He said he loved me.
He said he loved me.
He said...
he said he loved me!
Harris?!
- Harris. She's in our room.
- Who?
- I don't know. I don't know... come on!
- No.
- Please please. I'm scared.
- No.
Harris?!
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!
Maybe she got in
before we went to bed.
How? The whole
house was locked
and we were home
all night.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Uh. No. Ma'am.
we didn't find anyone.
The alarm was tripped
in the living room.
but I didn't see any sign
of forced entry.
Well. She got in
somehow.
Has everything been all right here
tonight. Ma'am?
Thank you for your time.
Officer.
Good night.
- I told you... she's doing it again.
- Kira is not stalking us.
You don't seem
too convinced I'm wrong.
Why would she?
What she did before was different.
She followed you around.
She showed up at your office.
- She called us at all hours.
- It was right before our wedding.
- It was a hard time for her.
- Bullshit.
You know what?
You didn't believe me then either.
All right.
I'll call her tomorrow.
I refuse to live like this.
We're gonna sort this out... tonight!
Kira?
Whoa. What are you doing?
- You can't break in there.
- Why not?
She does it to us.
- Where are you going?
- I'm trying the back.
Kira?
God. It is cold
in here.
- Get a flashlight.
- Okay.
Harris.
What is it?
I don't know.
It's writing.
- Oh my God!
- Don't don't. Call 911!
Ha... Harris.
Kira?
Dr. Travis. You have
a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis... a visitor
in the main lobby.
Kira Hayden.
We're friends.
We found her.
- Has her family been contacted?
- Is she all right?
I'm waiting on the results
of a couple of tests.
but uh. She should be.
Those markings all over her...
what were those?
Teeth marks.
- God.
- Someone bit her?
And there's also some bleeding
indicating a possible...
sexual assault.
- Can I see her?
- Sorry. I'm limiting contact
pending a full
psych evaluation.
If there's any changes.
I'll let you know.
I'm sorry. Harris.
Oh. Well. Good news is
she's not stalking you.
You know what?
That's not fair.
I know. Sorry.
I'm gonna give Sid a call.
- Hello.
- Uh. Hi.
- Is this Sid Vance's number?
- Yeah. Hold on.
Okay.
Oh...
hey...
oh...
- Sid.
- Hey. Man.
- Who was that?
- I can't talk right now.
but you gotta come over and check
this out. You're not gonna believe
- What's happening.
- Sid. Slow down.
Hey.
Doctor?!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help
this person!
Help me!
There was somebody there!
Oh. God!
There was
somebody there!
Let's go.
- Hey. You guys made it.
- What's going on?
You gotta come check this out.
but be careful when you come in...
- The thermal sensors are on.
- Thermal sensors?
I think I'm
being haunted.
Well. I would not go
that far. Mr. Vance.
Haunting requires some level
of paranormal activity.
- Yeah. Uh. Sid...
- Who are these people?
- Who are you?
- Vincent Cochet. And who are you?
These are my friends
Harris and Allison.
Thank you.
And this is my assistant...
- Colleague.
- Frances Culpepper.
- They're ghost hunters.
- Paranormal investigators.
We are from the Parapsychology
Department at Madison College.
Mr. Vance answered
my advertising
offering a reward to anyone
experiencing a paranormal phenomena...
which we have yet
to see.
- I got your phenomena.
- Hey!
What makes you think
you're being haunted?
Some weird shit's
been happening to me. Man.
I hear noises and footsteps
and there's these little fires.
Listen. We have
been here 10 hours
and the scariest thing
we've seen is your bathroom.
Well. Maybe that's because
you don't know what you're doing.
Or maybe we are investigating
the claims of someone
whose biggest decision of the day is
whether to get drunk or stoned.
Hey. Why don't you read
between the lines?
Okay okay okay.
can we please maintain some level
of scientific environment here?
- These two have been at it all day.
- That's long enough.
- We are gone.
- I think it's happening to us too.
I mean.
I think
we're being haunted.
I'm Vincent Cochet.
paranormal investigator.
Hello.
Do you remember
when you first noticed
the activities?
Maybe three weeks ago.
Go on.
It started
with noises...
thumping. Scratching.
I thought it was
the pipes.
But then tonight a woman
broke into our house.
I thought it was Kira.
but when I saw her tonight.
I knew it wasn't her.
But there was a woman in the room.
I'm not sure
if you are aware.
but your time frame
coincides with Mr. Vance's
first claim
of activities. Huh?
- Did you see each other at the time?
- Yeah. Uh...
a friend died
in a car accident.
- We saw each other at the funeral.
- You didn't tell me
- You went to a funeral. Mr. Vance.
- I told her.
You told me
that you went to a cemetery.
You didn't say anything
about a funeral.
'Cause I didn't go
to the funeral.
I met them at the reception
and then later we went back.
- Back where?
- The cemetery.
- At night?
- Mm-hmm. What?
Just weird. That's all.
Did your friend Kira
also go back to the cemetery?
Yeah. She was there.
- Did something happen?
- No.
- I think we should tell him.
- Tell us what?
Yeah. Tell us what?
Look. Sid got drunk
and pissed on a grave.
Well. Yeah.
but that's not it.
We also sort
of danced.
You what?
You know.
danced on some graves.
Wait... I'm sorry.
you danced on graves?
Sid found a card
about dancing
and. Yes. We danced
on graves... big deal.
What card?
Do you still have it?
I don't even remember
getting home that night.
I'm not sure if you are aware
of the possible ramifications of...
We didn't do anything.
Yeah. You did... it's called
burial desecration.
Yes.
Get the camera.
Hey. Check this out.
Hasn't done that
before.
Mr. Vance's apartment.
witnessing what I suspect
to be a low level
of a spectral
manifestation
of a child's
burning footprints.
It's not spectral.
Is this reward
cash or check?
I spoke to the nurse
at the hospital.
She said she's keeping
an eye on Kira.
- The best place for her.
- Yeah.
I just hope these people
from the college can help.
They said
they were experts.
And did you guys see
all that equipment?
- And besides they...
- Have a really creepy house.
- I'm Vincent Cochet.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh. Hello.
- Nice house.
Thank you. It was left by
a wealthy alumnus
who committed his life
to parapsychology study.
We're being taped?
Experiments are conducted
throughout the house...
- In case anything happens.
- "Happens"?
Evidence of the paranormal
is the Holy Grail.
Please.
So its origin
is not clear.
but the verse was obviously intended
as a celebration of life.
By dancing on graves?
It's a common practice
amongst pagan religions:
Druidism. Satanism. Wicca.
They sort of all embrace
this "live-for-the-moment" philosophy.
What has us concerned
is the following verse.
Uh. The gravedancers'
lament.
"O Fool. O Lout.
O Unfortunate one.
The dead now mocked.
their time has come.
Heed these words
for souls do roam
And though be dead
follow you home.
Its rage will swell
as nights grow bright.
Despair and fear.
this fatal plight.
From moon to moon.
you'll have this guest
To seal thy fate
and lay you at rest. "
Scary. Huh?
What you found. My friend.
wasn't a simple rhyme celebrating life.
It was a spell.
a curse.
How does a curse get
on a bereavement card?
Well. Dangerous occult
mediums are fairly commonplace...
tarot cards. Ouija boards.
that sort of thing.
Sounds like
a lawsuit to me.
You're shitting me? By dancing on
a grave... what? We pissed off a ghost?
Three...
one for each grave.
How do we end it? There's gotta be a
gravedancers' cure or something. Right?
No... none that
we are aware of.
So we're gonna
be haunted forever?
The curse lasts
from moon to moon...
one month...
one month.
It's already been
over three weeks.
It will persist
until the final moment
of the final night.
Or...
- Or what?!
- Until you're laid to rest.
You mean
until we're killed?
Well. The curse is tied
to the lunar cycle
and moon to moon.
uh...
"Its rage will swell
as night grows bright. "
So the closer we get
to the full moon.
the more severe
the hauntings will become.
You're saying we're all
gonna end up like Kira?
According
to the lament. Yes.
If we can identify the graves
you danced on. Then...
get some idea of who
these people were...
it may help us
to keep you safe.
Which is why we need you to take us
to Cresent View Cemetery.
- Screw that. I'm not going back there.
- Not a good idea.
If we don't. There is no way
of knowing
what could be
coming next...
no way.
Kira Hayden?
He's here. He's here.
- Who's here?
- Get out of here.
Let me help.
Come on.
Don't touch me.
He hates when
other people touch me.
Get out of here!
Oh. God.
Get out of here.
No!
Don't touch her!
Stop it!
Don't touch her!
No! Please!
No! No! No!
I don't get it...
you'd think ghosts would dig
hanging out from moon to moon.
- Why are they so pissed?
- The curse pulled them in
from the other side...
maybe it hurt.
Whatever the reason.
Mr. Vance.
they clearly
don't dig it.
Mm-hmm... "dig it. "
What are you saying?
That if I danced on John Perez's grave.
we'd get haunted?
What about Mother Teresa?
Like. You can't just
decide to be haunted.
There's more to it
than that.
There's spirit. There's state of mind.
that sort of thing.
Yeah. But why wait?
Why not just kill us now?
Who says
they are not trying?
Maybe they are not
strong enough yet.
Yeah. Tell that
to Kira.
This is it...
this is the spot.
Yeah. This looks
familiar.
- Oh. You gotta be joking.
- I'm not joking.
This area is designated
for the city's undesirables...
the murderers. The rapists.
the mentally-ill.
the socially unacceptable.
Found it.
Are you sure
this is yours?
Positive.
What about Kira's?
Kira was dancing...
well. Next to me.
to my left.
It's gotta be it here.
Yeah. Definitely...
this is the... this is it...
the tree.
I remember the tree.
I'm afraid your friend
is in trouble.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I tried calling. But he wouldn't
let me. I tried.
It's okay.
We're here for you.
They said you
and Allison found me.
Yeah. You scared us.
We heard someone tried
to attack you and a nurse.
It's not what
you think.
I know.
Kira. Um...
you're not
the only one
having these
experiences.
Yeah. We're being
haunted too.
It's because of that night
in the cemetery.
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.
We've met some people
who are trying to help us.
- Once we work this out...
- I'm not staying here.
You have to.
This is the best place for you.
You'll have security.
the whole thing.
- I'm going with you.
- No. You have to stay.
I'm going with you.
What we have found
sheds some lights
on your experiences.
- This is Dennis?
- Yes.
That's a happy-looking kid.
Born October 5th. 1948.
to Robert
and Claire Faberly.
Dennis was a quiet
sickly child
with an unfortunate
affinity for fire.
By age five. He'd set
numerous minor blazes
and ended up burning down
his father's feed store.
It's believed
he started the blaze
which accidentally
burned down his house in 1956.
killing Dennis.
his two siblings and his parents.
But if it was an accident.
why is he buried
in the psycho section
of the graveyard?
Well. The locals
didn't think it was an accident.
Uh. Emma Westbrook:
a well-liked and respected
high-school music teacher.
In 1923. she began
an affair with a married man
named Theodore Gusford...
- How do you know that?
- A confession to the police.
And after Theo ended
the affair.
Emma was so distraught
that she broke into his house
and killed his wife.
- She killed someone?
- With an ax.
And then she waited
for him to come back and killed him.
When the police found her.
she was sitting
in Gusford's living room.
covered in blood.
playing the piano.
Okay.
Kira. Um...
the grave you danced on
had "good riddance" on the stone
and for...
for good reason.
The person buried there
was William Langer.
Don't I get a picture?
He was a judge?
And by all accounts
an outstanding citizen.
Uh. A churchgoing guy.
family man.
charitable.
When he died in 1890.
the. Uh...
the town was gonna set up
a memorial
until they found
his journals.
What kind of journals?
Personal ones...
sort of detailing his appetite
for bizarre sexual exploits.
Sadomasochism.
self-mutilation. Tortures...
and then there was this.
She was found dead
in Langer's basement...
she was in a cage.
Wow. You sure know
how to pick them.
We head back
to my house.
wait it out. A few days from now
life returns to normal.
I don't have a few days.
That bastard's getting stronger.
I can feel it.
They are all getting stronger
and the lament is quite clear...
"To seal thy fate
and lay you at rest. "
I'm afraid
you can't wait it out.
Why did you call us down here?
To tell me that I'm gonna be
killed
by a piano teacher?
No. Ax-murdering
piano teacher.
We called you here to tell you
that we may have found the solution.
There was this documented case
of the lament in 1935.
The victim
did something
and it ended
the curse.
What?
Um. Well. It's um...
it's a little extreme.
"A little extreme"?
Burial desecration is
the root of your problems.
You rebury the body.
the curse is over.
Well...
I need to keep
an eye on the others.
What?!
I have to do this alone?
Hey.
just slide him in.
Make sure you get
every single piece.
Ugh. Ugh!
Hey.
Jesus. You scared
the shit out of me.
Make sure you get
every single piece.
- Why?
- If not. This is all for nothing.
Go away.
Okay.
- Every single piece.
- Okay.
Ugh.
Pay dirt.
That's disgusting.
Kira.
Help me.
Culpepper. Help me!
Help help help!
I'm coming. Kira.
Coming!
Help!
- Help!
- Hang in there. Kira!
Pull harder.
Culpepper.
Help me.
Oh my God!
Here we go.
Culpepper.
Put it out.
Oh my God.
I'm trying.
Hey. Someone's coming!
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.
Move it!
Get out quick!
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.
He restoreth my soul...
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness
for His Name's sake.
Yea. Though I walk
through the valley of the shadow
of death. I will fear no evil...
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- That's it?
- Yes.
Careful with
yourself now.
I know.
it's a relief.
- Kind of.
- Yeah.
Everything seems
all right.
Yeah. It is all right.
I don't know
how I know.
but it is.
You hear that?
Allison. There's someone
in the house.
Oh my God!
Oh my God.
they're in the house!
Oh my God.
What?
We'll be right there.
Are you okay?
This shit
ain't over.
- Is everybody okay?
- No thanks to you.
We did what you said...
we dug up the bodies.
It didn't work.
I know you are
disappointed.
but. You know.
we should remain calm.
We also clearly
stated that it might not work.
You didn't say anything
about it pissing them off even more.
I don't believe the entities
are any more angry.
- Really? And how would you know?
- We are doing the best we can.
This is not
a precise science.
Okay. All right.
Look. The bottom line is.
we need to keep you safe
and the best way to do that
is to keep
everybody together.
Stick together
so we can do what?
Come inside
and I'll tell you.
Fuck that.
Where would you go.
Mr. Mitchel?
Sid?
Harris. Please.
It's not time
to be alone. Mr. Mitchel.
Frances.
Mm?
What are we
looking at?
I don't recall seeing
the fence from here.
The school probably
cut the trees back.
Well. Maybe.
What's the plan now?
Sit in a circle.
hold hands and chat?
We... we... we wait.
- We wait?
- It's the final night of the curse
and. Uh... tomorrow. The second
the sun rises. It'll all be over.
- You said we couldn't wait it out.
- Yes. It's true.
- There was no indication...
- That survival isn't possible
if we stick it out.
Yeah.
No. We're not staying.
Let's go.
- Please.
- Just like that. Huh?
Do the math. Kira. We'd rather
take our chances alone with Emma.
See. Kira.
what'd I tell you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You bailing is just so typical.
I can't risk Allison.
So you're leaving
because of her?
Why shouldn't he? I didn't
let anyone talk me into...
dancing on graves!
I didn't talk anybody
into anything.
And. Besides. If you hadn't left
Harris at the wake.
- Maybe things would've been different.
- This is my fault?
- I'm just saying.
- Sid. Shut up.
Fuck you. Harris.
If she'd been around.
granted it would've sucked.
but we wouldn't have gotten drunk.
we wouldn't have danced on graves.
and you sure as hell wouldn't have
made out with Kira.
Is that...
is that true. Harris?
Is it?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
This is going to be
a long night.
Vincent. They shouldn't
be alone.
They're not.
Do you have
another one of those?
Allison. About that night
in the cemetery...
Do you still love Harris?
Yes.
- But he doesn't love me.
- How do you know?
He wants to have
a family with you.
I'm a memory.
He still cares
about you.
And I still care
about him. But...
what you guys have
is entirely different.
He loves you so much...
he told me so that night
in the cemetery.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm so over Harris.
anyway...
maybe you
haven't heard. But...
I got a new man
in my life.
Tsk.
- They are just talking.
- Mm.
Huh-uh... calm before
the storm.
She made out
with her husband.
We kissed:
we didn't make out.
Don't even try
to pull that shit.
I saw you!
Why don't we talk about the real reason
that kiss pissed you off?
- And what's that?
- You're in love with Kira.
- What?!
- Yeah.
You loved her since college.
but you've always been too chickenshit
to do anything about it.
Jesus. Sid. You can't even admit it now.
Right. It's just
so typical of you
to use these cheap lawyer tactics
to turn the attention on me
when you're the one
cheating on his wife.
You know
that's not true.
Nothing is ever your fault.
right. Harris?
I'm not the one
wasting my life.
I'm not wasting my life.
I have what I choose to have.
- Yeah. Everything except Kira.
- Shut up. Man.
Stop.
Get off me!
Run!
Is it him?
It's Langer!
I see her...
she's running upstairs.
Fuck you.
you fucking bastard!
Let me go.
Let me go. You bastard!
Help!
Please...
bastard. Let me go!
No!
Help me.
Oh. She's losing
too much blood.
It's gonna be okay. Sweetie.
We'll get you out.
It's gonna be okay.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Uh. I'm sorry. Guys.
could you...
give me a minute?
Have you found
a way out?
The gate is wrapped
around the entire house.
And still no signal?
And phone out
there too.
Where's
Culpepper?
I'm not sure.
Frances?
I am so sorry. Vincent.
It's not your fault.
We knew the dangers
if they stayed here.
You can't blame yourself.
You need to understand.
Understand what?
Yeah... understand what.
Culpepper?
Okay. I...
I needed the evidence.
I couldn't let it end.
- Tell me those are not...
- We buried those!
I took them out
of the bag.
How could you do that?
How could you do that?!
I'm so sorry. Vincent.
I just...
I needed the house
and the cameras.
I had to document
that there was a haunting.
Look. I knew
I could end it. All right?
There's an open grave outside. We just...
we've gotta put the skull in it.
How do we do that?!
How do we get
out of this house?
I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I just... I just...
I just needed
the evidence.
Evidence.
Harris?
Harris!
No no no!
Oh. God! Do you have any
idea of what you're doing?
Stop it!
This should've
been all over.
How are we gonna bury these?
We can't get outside.
There has to be
a way out.
Come on!
- I can't get it.
- Welded shut.
You just can't get good
paranormal help these days.
Look. Harris. I'm sorry. Man.
I didn't mean to say those things.
I'm sorry too.
- We didn't find anything.
- Does she have to be here?
- I can still help.
- Unless you have dynamite for the bars.
- Nobody wants your help.
- I know you're angry.
- But now it's not the time.
- When is the time?
'Cause the sun rises
in less than an hour.
Then it's best not to waste it
fighting with each other!
You'd better hope that little pyro
gets me. 'cause I swear if I make it...
What?
The flashlights
are in the hallway.
What what?
Wasn't Kira
in this room?
I locked this door.
Oh my God!
What?
That's Emma's song.
I'm not going anywhere
unless something's chasing me.
Stay here.
Oh. God!
What am I looking at?
Uh. I-I don't know.
Kira was dead.
She was dead.
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe...
No no no. She is.
She is dead.
Then how do you
explain that?
Kira?
- Kira?
- Harris?
I don't know if that's
a good idea. Man.
Kira?
Kira?
Emma?
Help!
Bitch!
Help!
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You're the expert.
Wait wait wait...
do you guys smell smoke?
I think she's gone.
- Go! Go!
- Wait.
Go! Come on!
Come on!
- Vincent. Move! Let's go!
- Let's go!
Go. Vincent!
Hey! Hey!
Damn it!
Light.
Okay. Fire extinguisher...
I gotta get
a fire extinguisher...
Fire extinguisher.
Oh. Man.
Help! Help!
Let me out!
Help!
Let me out!
He's in here!
Let me out!
Get away!
Stay away!
Harris.
- Harris!
- Sid?
No! No!
- Vincent?
- It's too late. Go!
Allison. The window!
- I don't wanna go.
- Great. No bars!
- Come on!
- I don't wanna go...
No. You have
to do this! Go!
- I don't wanna go without you.
- You can do this. You'll be fine!
- I love you. Harris!
- Go!
- I love you. I love you.
- I love you too.
- No!
- Please.
I love you. Harris.
Whoa!
Oh. God!
Get in. Get in!
Go!
Go... go!
Allison. Go!
Go!
Harris!
Back to hell!
Harris!
Harris! Harris!
Good Lord help me!
- Where the fuck is he?
- Harris!
Oh my God!
It's over.
Could anyone bring me
to the hospital?
I need
an ambulance.
What is it?
Nothing.
just the caretaker.
