SHE SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN
SHE SCREAMS
Alexi?
SHOUTING OVER MONITORS
SHE SCREAMS
Captain, winds gusting at 110. If they get to 130,
we're verging category five!
Put her back into the wind, Woods.
Captain, the barge is taking on water.
Captain!
I've got eyes for Christ's sake! I've seen worse, Foster.
Stand your station.
Woods!
Green water!
HOOTER SOUNDS
Steve! Engine room!
The door's jammed. I can't get in!
If water stalls the engine, we're history!
Hiko, take the torch and cut the door.
I'm going up top.
Hiko, let me help you!
Captain!
Recommend new course setting. 229 degrees magnetic. Captain?
If we get to the eye we have calm seas for two hours!
We can make repairs, steady the barge!
Should I head for the eye?
What the hell is going on?!
The engine room is taking on water!
Pump it out. You're the engineer!
We can't get in!
The bulkhead took a hit. The door's wedged! Hiko's cutting it now.
Jesus Christ! The barge!
We gotta cut that thing loose!
That's not an option.
Should I head for the breach? I need an answer.
Wind's 125, Captain!
Take a look! That barge goes down, we go down with it!
Well, that's a chance I'll take.
I'm cutting it loose.
Stay away from that door, mister.
What's so precious about your goddamned cargo?
The cargo is mine. I've leveraged everything I own against it.
And it's not insured.
What is wrong with these people?
I go out that door, you'll shoot me. I stay here, we're all dead.
Hold the tanks!
Ohh!
Let me tell you something. You ever put a gun in my face again....
You'll what?
You figure it out.
Sir, what about Foster's idea?
I can reach the eye.
I've let you down, lad.
The water's coming in faster than it's going out.
I can't believe we were so stupid to sign up with that guy again.
I would've decked him!
He had us pulling 500 tons of lumber and steel, uninsured, in a typhoon
Foster got tossed out of the Navy for hitting a superior officer.
Hey, Hiko! Coming through.
I'll tell you this - it's the last time we go for percentage of cargo.
Damn straight.
I told you it was a bad idea.
My idea? It was your idea.
It was your idea.
How is it?
It's bad.
Define "bad".
We're sinking.
That's bad.
So does anyone have any suggestions?
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Come back.
Three or four days of supplies.
That's food and that's water.
All right, Hiko, put that back. We'll distribute this.
NHF piece of junk!
Hey, you buy this shit?
Wait, wait, wait! I'm picking up a contact.
There might be another ship in the eye with us.
Speed - zero knots. Dead in the water but it's big.
Hail it, Foster.
Ahoy, vessel latitude 29 degrees south, longitude 179 degrees east.
This is the Sea Star. 12 miles
northwest of your position. Come back.
So where the hell is the captain?
KNOCK AT DOOR
I'm busy.
There's a ship in the eye, dead in the water, 12 miles out.
Dead in the water?
I'll be there in a minute.
Dead in the water...
Captain, dead ahead 300 yards.
Hail it, Woods.
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star approaching from the northwest.
Dead ahead! 300 yards!
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star
approaching from the northwest.
'Please come back. Over.'
< You see anything?
No. Not a thing.
That ain't ours, brother.
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star.
'Come back. Over.'
'This is the Sea Star. Is anybody there?
'Over.'
She looks Russian.
The Academic Vladislav Volkov. Missile and satellite tracking ship.
ship's complement 300, armament none
She's fitted for scientific purposes. 42 labs,
five machine shops with advanced robotics.
three parabolic dishes maintain communication with spacecraft.
Ahoy! The Vladislav Volkov!
I am the captain of the Sea Star. Is there anyone aboard?
Ahoy!
Baker,
break out the shotguns, flashlights and walkies. We're going aboard.
Jesus Christ. This is kinda stupid, Stevie.
Come on.
Very stupid.
Stevie, this is very stupid.
Stevie, Stevie... Those are bullet holes.
I don't like this at all, man.
Ahoy the bridge!
Anyone aboard?
Bridge is deserted.
What the hell happened in here?
What a mess.
Looks like somebody powered it down, Captain.
Captain? Do you see anything?
You'll be the first to know, Woods.
What do you think? Pirates?
Mafia, probably.
Pipe down. Check the radio.
Smashed.
These logs are worthless. Unless somebody reads Russian.
Storm wall 16 miles due east. You've about an hour and a half.
He's, er, thinking, Foster.
You know, something you were paid to do.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Huh?
THEY LAUGH
What? What?
Salvage. Salvage, baby!
You signed on for a percentage. But you never figured I'd bring you this
A ship abandoned in international waters.
Maritime law says she's a derelict.
All we do is tow her to safety, slap a salvage lien on her
and the Russians have to pay us 10% of her value to get her back.
Richie, put a number on her for me.
There's three satellite dishes, one kinda fucked up.
state-of-the-art stuff.
Let's see. We're talking...
is 30 million dollars! That's what's comin' our way.
The opportunity of a lifetime!
That's about what? 30 grand apiece?
That's at one percent. Right?
I'm willing to change all that.
Cut you in for ten percent. That's three million dollars each.
What do you think of that?
What do you think?
Is it legal?
Totally. Totally legal.
Shit! I'm in if you're in.
Yeah. I'm good.
What about you, Foster?
Oh, Foster, please, come on!
- SQUEAKY:
- Easy money!
There's no such thing, Squeaky.
I'll take that as a yes.
Baker, find the generator. Try to get the main engine running.
Squeaky, you go, too. Richie, throw a line down to the tug.
Foster, try to get the navigation
Captain, my father was an admiral.
I know maritime law. If anybody's alive you can't claim her.
Then let's not find anyone.
What does that mean?
Just that.
I hope we don't find anyone alive.
Woods, come back to me.
'We're gonna need to turn the ship into the wind.'
It just doesn't add up.
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere, dead in the water, crew vanished.
Why would they abandon ship?
I dunno.
And who the hell can we trust? This is a lot of goddamn money.
The only guys we can trust is just you and me, Stevie.
I wouldn't take a cheque from the captain.
Woods is wound so tight
you couldn't pull a pin out of his ass with a tractor.
And Hiko is... I don't understand what the hell Hiko is.
Richie's crazy like a fox, Stevie.
But you know I'm thinking he might just be there for us.
And Foster's good.
Good? What do you mean by "good"?
She's solid. On the level. What'd you think I meant?
Sounds like you think she's hot.
Course I think she's hot. Don't you?
Right here, Stevie.
Got it?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh, shit.
No go?
Nope.
What's wrong with this thing?
Here's your problem. Looks like somebody trashed the control panel.
Relays are unplugged.
Let's hustle. We got no power to the rudder in a typhoon, we're screwed.
I'm hustling, right?
OK.
Go?
Give it a shot.
ENGINE CROAKS
SCREECHING
That's more like it.
'Captain?'
I'm on my way, Woods.
HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING
What the hell's that?
Good job, Baker. You lit us up like a pinball machine.
MACHINE WHIRRING
MACHINE CLICKS AND WHIRS
I tell ya, we're gonna be rich!
You're gonna be a rich man, Hiko.
Captain?
Somebody's running this.
Looks like it's running itself.
Computers don't do that.
MONITOR BEEPS
I don't know about computers. That's an anchor.
Captain! The anchor went down on the tug!
Baker! Come back! We need you up here!
Baker! We need you on deck now!
On my way! Squeak, you catch that?
What the hell happened?
Any trouble, don't be a cowboy.
Don't leave me too long.
Stay on your radio.
Woods!
I'm gonna go get some help.
Woods!
Woods!
Hiko!
What are you doing?!
Leave me alone!
Shit!
Steve!
I got you.
DISTANT THUNDER
That anchor didn't drop by itself.
Somebody else is on board.
I hear that!
I'll be all right.
Not without stitches.
Lift up. Lift up!
Hold this.
What are you lookin' at?
Hey, it could've been me!
'Stevie, what's going on up there?'
We lost the tug, Squeak.
'She's gone.'
That sucks.
'How we doing down there?'
Fine. It's automated. Runs itself.
Negative. We got somebody on board. That's who sank the tug.
'I want you to bolt the engine room door shut.'
I copy that. Hurry up, will you?
Let's split into two groups, root him out.
I just have to fix his leg.
Hold your horses, mister!
I'm still captain here!
They left this on the bridge.
You were captain of the Sea Star. She just sank, right?
I'm a ranking officer.
Listen to me, Baker. For 30 million dollars,
I'm willing to overlook all that's come between us.
How about you?
Good man.
- Richie!
- Yeah?
Take Woods. Go the engine room to Squeaky.
We're going to take Hiko,
get him to a sick bay, get that leg fixed.
Stay away, Woods.
You get me killed, I'm gonna kick your ass. Take my shit. Let's go.
Wait up for us, Foster.
It'll be down that corridor.
Where does this go, Richie?
It goes down. Come on.
METALLIC CLUNK
HE HUMS
MACHINE WHIRS AND CHEEPS
Hello.
MACHINE CHIRPS
Hello! Listen, I'm a friend, all right?
I'm Cuban. I'm not American!
Anybody in there?
Hello!
LOUD CHIRPING
WHIP
Christ! Stevie! CHIRPING GETS LOUDER
Weapons locker.
What the hell is this all about?
Bingo!
Put him up here. Come on, Hiko.
All right, tighten that down.
All right, this is gonna hurt.
Just get on with it.
HE GASPS
You have a high pain threshold.
Yeah, I usually do it myself No, really.
Hey, Hiko! Some dry clothes.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, man...
All right, here we go.
Come on, Richie. Isn't that enough guns?
Woods, you can never be too rich, too thin or too well armed.
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, man...
Get the green bag.
Green bag? Oh, man...
I'm carrying too much. I got a bad latissimus.
I'm tellin' ya, my back isn't gonna let me do this.
I can't deal with it.
I'm tellin' ya... Let me get rid of some of this crap.
Hey, Woods, what do you make of this?
I have no idea.
Tactical short-range surface-to-air.
This is beautiful, man!
I'm thrilled Can we go now?
In a minute. Look around, man.
I am.
Hello, Mr Cable.
Hey, Woods, cover this.
Looks like some kind of ejection seat or escape vehicle.
Launch buttons.
Cool.
- <
- Richie...
Look at these doors, man.
That's an awful lot of blood, Richie.
Now can we go?
Yeah. Yeah...
Foster... What are you gonna do with your three million?
I don't have it yet.
What about you, Hiko?
Three million? Probably open a school.
A school? For what?
Lots of little kids running around. Reading, writing, learning Maori.
Sweet.
It's a dream thing.
How about you, Baker?
Oh, I don't know.
Always loved the sea.
Probably buy an island.
Oh, yeah?
Does it have a beach?
Beautiful white sand.
Hammock, sailboat.
What about a house?
A villa.
Thatched roof. Overlooking a lagoon.
Sounds nice.
When are you two gettin' married?
Hey!
Argh! Take it easy, mate!
You take it easy!
Is she dead?
No.
What's this shit, Richie?
Somebody doesn't like electricity.
Come on.
It looks like somebody tried to rewire the ship.
OK?
Yeah.
So that's done.
What's all this stuff in her bag?
Videotapes, cigarettes. Hairspray?
Watch out! They're micronades.
What?
Thermite. One of those things blows, burn a hole through a deck.
Be careful.
What, she wanted to sink the ship?
Squeaky, talk to me.
How does it feel?
Good. Thanks.
Are you gonna be able to walk?
Yeah, I'll be OK.
Squeak, que pasa, buddy?
'Where the hell are you, man?'
Shit!
Richie, Woods, come back.
This ship's got a missile room.
'I don't give a damn!'
Squeaky's not answering. Find him.
'We got a crew member who unloaded an Uzi on us. You watch your ass.'
Copy that.
I'm going to the engine room.
I'll see you on the bridge.
Steve... Watch your back.
Hey, Woods... You comprehend this Cyrillic crap?
It's just like chicken scratchings to me.
SCREECHING
Richie! Richie, help me!
Hey, Woods...
That thing smells like shit! What is it?
It's robotic, Woodsie. High-tech robotics.
Where'd you learn how to sew?
My grandfather.
It's all right. It's OK. We're not going to hurt you.
The power. Turn off the power. Shut down the ship. You're in danger.
What's she on about?
I don't know. I don't know.
Captain, please!
What's your name?
What happened on this ship? Where are her crew?
Dead.
Dead?
Good.
Turn off the power. It needs power to move.
What...needs...power?
It. From the Mir.
Mir space station?
She's a fruitcake.
Come on, Captain.
She's a nutter. Perfect
Hiko, come on!
Drop it!
Drop it!
It's OK.
You don't understand.
Look... I'm not gonna hurt you.
My name's Kelly Foster.
I'm a navigator.
I'm Nadia.
Nadia Vinogradiya. Chief science officer.
Nadia... What happened?
Where's your crew?
I told you. They all deserted.
What happened?
A week ago during a transmission from Mir, something came on board.
We thought our transmitters were malfunctioning so we shut down.
It took control of computers, scanned information - language,
encyclopaedias, medical data. It was learning.
Learning what?
How to kill us.
My captain, Alexi, and me were the last to survive.
We cut their cables, smashed them...
Wait. You just said "them". Before you said "it".
Who's "them"?
Um, machines.
Machines?
Oh...
I'm telling you the truth.
I-I know.
- BANGING ON DECKS
- Foster!
Yeah, I'm in here.
It's OK. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
She's nuts.
Something scared the hell out of her.
Let's get her up to the bridge, Hiko?
Give me the flashlight.
It's OK, it's OK. We'll get you something to eat.
Come on, it's OK.
You OK?
Go!
No!
Got her?
I'm not a threat! I'm not a threat!
I used to go turkey hunting with my dad. Beats the shit out of this.
FAINT WHIRRING
Shh! Shh! You hear that?
Sounds like somebody's working.
Oh, God...
Hey! Anybody in here?
Quiet, man!
Damn. There might be somebody.
Hey, Woodsie. There's another of those things.
FLIPS SWITCH
Let's go, man! I'm outta here.
MACHINE SQUEAKS
Richie? Woods? Where the hell are you?
Hey, Steve, listen. There's a machine shop down here with, er...5
state-of-the-art robotics.
I said to get your asses down to the engine room.
Yeah, yeah. We're coming.
Come on, Woodsie.
I'm not coming.
Hey, little buddy.
Richie, let's go.
Did the other one bother you?
Huh? No, it didn't.
Richie...
Richie...
GUN FIRES
Goddamn!
Arrghhh!
GUN FIRES
I'm not taking this shit, man!
Shit!
Oh, God!
This is Richie. There's a Russian here. The sonofabitch shot at us!
'Woods is hurt. So watch it.'
Copy that. How is he?
Just tell him it's bad. Ow! Yeah, bad!
He'll live but he ain't in a good mood, man.
Get him to the engine room. No more sightseeing.
Yeah, copy.
Get up, get up.
Squeaky...
Squeak?
Holy shit.
What the hell...
Oh, my God...
Jesus Christ... Squeak!
HE BANGS ON DOOR
Squeak! Open up!
-
- Ow!
Don't shoot. It's us!
Where the hell have you been? Back from your holiday?
Jesus Christ...
Woods, you're a mess.
Thank you.
You said a Russian did this?
A machine did that with a nail gun.
Yeah, that's right. You gotta see it.
There's some weird shit.
"Weird" ain't the word.
I need medical attention.
Shut the fuck up!
I don't belong on this ship.
Someone just welded the engine room door shut. Squeaky's still missing.
HE SNIFFS Richie...
Richie... It's that smell again.
- Squeak?
- Squeaky!
ROBOTIC RUSSIAN VOICE
Is that you?
Shit!
Go!
You're all going to die.
Hear that, Foster?
We're all going to die
Because there are aliens on this ship
That's all the grounds I need.
One of my men is missing. And I want some answers.
And no more of this Twilight Zone stuff.
I don't know about your men.
Rubbish. I'm going to give you five seconds.
Then I'll blow your brains out. One...
She doesn't know where he is. She was in sick bay!
She knows. She dropped an anchor on my tug. She fired at us. Two...
Captain! Hiko, come on!
I'm not feeling sympathetic.
Me neither.
Three...
I don't care. Just shut down the power.
Captain... She's not going to tell you what you want to hear.
Hey, what has she to say about this?
Up here on the chart table, Richie.
Bastard!
What the bloody hell is that?
It beats the hell out of us.
It's Alexi. My captain.
Whatever IT is, it tried to kill us.
Squeaky's still AWOL.
Somebody welded the engine room door shut. We're not alone.
She's got a friend. Someone explain what is going on!
Finish your story, Nadia.
The energy that came from the Mir
infested all of the ship's electrical systems -
mainframe computer, labs, machine shops.
They activated fire extinguishers. 67 died from gas poisoning.
A quarter of the crew.
It cut us off from machine shops
and started building the little ones first -
the gatherers.
We saw lots of them. One nailed Woods.
Then came something...
more dangerous.
Half man, half machine.
Biomechanism engineering beyond our comprehension.
The rest of the crew deserted, taking their chances in the sea.
Only Alexi and me stayed, cutting cables.
Why cutting cables?
Machines are controlled by the electrical energy in the computer.
If we cut their source of power, they die.
We cut these to get him here.
What the hell are you talking about? What is this thing in the computer?
It's a lifeform. Not cellular but electrical in nature.
Extremely intelligent.
Lightning that can think?
It has no shape but it's giving itself what it lacks.
It's creating a new lifeform
using the ship and crew.
Blood is still pumping through his brain. There's no decomposition.
Yeah, right here,
some kind of coil, a self-contained power supply.
Amazing... This brain is still alive.
Stop fuckin' around with the damn thing!
I'm just looking at it, Steve.
Alexi?
SHE SCREAMS
Touch it again, I cut your hands off.
I can respect that.
It's still Alexi. It's Alexi!
Rubbish! >
It's a pile of Russian rubbish! And I won't listen to any more of it.
There's no alien. It's something their government cooked up!
It went wrong. It ran amok and you think the world will find out!
Dr Igor fuckin' Frankenstein there.
Tell 'em the truth. It's some kind of medical experiment.
Alexi was no medical experiment.
He was my husband.
Rubbish.
Could someone come and look at the nails in my shoulder?
Woods, stop whining!
No!
Ow! God!
Ow!
Oh, my God...
Captain!
Brace yourselves!
We got to turn her into the wind!
The steering doesn't answer!
We can steer from the engine room.
You said the door was welded.
We cut the damn door!
Bring her. I want to keep her in my sight.
IT SCREECHES
I gotta get off this ship.
All clear.
Clear!
Clear.
SHIP RUMBLES
Did you feel that?
The ship's turning.
We turned 20 degrees. It's steering itself.
Ships don't steer themselves.
She's altered her course.
Let's go.
Engine room's one deck down.
METAL CLUNKS
What the hell was that?
Could be Squeak.
I don't care
I said it could be Squeak!
Steve...
Jesus Christ....
METAL CLANGS
Careful, Richie.
Yeah.
It's too weird. Don't open it.
What is it?
I don't know.
What you got?
It could be Squeaky.
Let me see. Let me see!
What the hell is that?
Open the door!
Don't open the damn door!
Squeak?
Steve.
Steve!
Richie! Help me, for God's sake!
Richie!
Shit!
Richie!
This way! This way!
Steve.
Where are we?
Communications room.
I'll call for help!
BANGING ON DOOR
Did you trash this?
Every transmitter.
BANG!
BANG!
Well, you didn't smash this one. Mayday!
No!
What the hell is wrong with you?! Are you out of your fuckin' mind?!
No-one is gonna claim salvage on this vessel but us.
You're no longer in charge!
Come here!
BANG!
BANG!
What do they want?
It wants to kill us.
They want something from us.
It wants to mutilate us.
Did you see Squeaky? It wants something from us!
Why don't we talk to it? It's in the computer.
What?!
It's in the computer, right?
What the hell?
What do I do?
Nadia, help. I need English.
Who are you?
ANNOUNCES OVER PA
Is that it? Is that the thing?
We mean you no harm.
ANNOUNCES OVER PA
'Species is destructive, invasive, noxious, harmful to the whole.'
What species?
Great. Just great It thinks we're germs.
What do you want from us?
'Viscous neurological transmitters.'
What the hell is that?
Part of an optic nerve.
What?
Spare parts. It wants us for spare parts.
BANG!
- It must be destroyed.
- How?
It's electrical. What happens when lightning hits water?
It drowns out.
It dissipates and dies. We can kill it!
If we sink the ship.
Where's the mainframe?
D deck, one deck below.
She's right. We kill the computer!
We gotta get out of here!
You want a way out? I'll show you a way out!
Steve.
Spare parts, my ass, man!
I ain't going up against them again. You do what you want!
I'm outta here!
Get down!
You're crazy!
Who's gonna carry my shit?! Who's gonna carry my shit?!
He's gone postal, man.
Come on, let's go!
Steve!
You coming?
You hit a superior officer, Foster.
You pushed me!
Fuck you!
You'll get yourselves killed!
FAINT ELECTRICAL BUZZ
Want to talk to me, do you?
MONITOR BEEPS
I knew you did.
Everton...
..is the...
dominant lifeform.
I am...Everton.
COMPUTER BEEPS
I will
help you
bring this ship to port.
New Zealand, Australia,
anywhere you want.
Workroom 14.
My brain is not becoming a hard drive for an alien!
MACHINE SCREECHES
Oh, I can use this. This is a good boy.
That door down there leads to the main computer room.
I thought you said this was gonna be well protected. Hiko!
- It's gone.
- Gone where?
Fuckin' thing moved itself.
LOUD MECHANICAL SCREECHING
Robert Everton. Captain of the Sea Star.
Thank you.
They're planning to sink this ship.
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's pretty amazing.
What with no head an' all.
Woods.
him and me,
together.
DEEP MECHANICAL VOICE: Are you Everton?
Are you the dominant lifeform?
How can I be of assistance to you?
Help me
to survive.
It's welded! We just came through here!
We've been set up!
This way.
Let's go!
Six years in the navy as a weapons specialist.
Graduated top of my class!
I'm gettin' out. If it thinks it's smarter than me,
it's gonna get a surprise.
Where are we going?
We can get out through here.
METAL CLANGS Ow! It's welded! What's there?
Dead end!
We need to pry this!
MACHINE SCREECHES
Arrghh!
Steve!
Hiko!
Steve, over here!
Hiko!
Hiko!
Come on! Let's go! Move!
Hiko!
Nadia, which way?!
The antenna control room!
OK! Steve!
Right behind you! Go! Just keep moving!
Keep going, Hiko, keep going.
Arrghh!
Arrghh!
Hiko!
Help me, Hiko!
Foster, hang on!
Foster!
Come on!
Come on!
Hiko!
Hiko!
Foster!
Hiko!
Foster! Come on!
He's gone. Keep moving!
Maybe he got to another part of the ship.
Not a chance!
Just a little goodbye gift.
We must find out where it's taking us! Steve!
Give me a hand!
We need a light.
We're headed here on this vector.
North northwest. Lord Howe Island.
Lord Howe? Why? There's nothing there.
There is.
A British Intelligence station with digital link-ups to satellites.
If it's in the Transoceanic Pacific Cable it can go anywhere!
"..Norfolk to the vessel at 29 south, 79 east."
"Received a mayday at 0800 hours."
"We have you on radar."
The mayday got through!
"If you cannot transmit, respond by flare."
We need a flare gun!
No! We need to warn them away!
Why?!
This thing is isolated on the ship! We can't let another ship near us.
We gotta sink this ship.
How?
Flood the hold with fuel and detonate it.
Let's do it.
MACHINE WHIRS
Jesus Christ...
Foster, get back!
You don't recognise me.
What's wrong?
I'm still your captain, Foster.
You must treat me with respect.
We know where you're going.
I know you do.
MACHINE SPEAKS OVER SPEAKERS: 'There's a whole world waiting out there.'
Steve, Foster, grenade!
Get down!
Through your captain it knows what we are planning.
We must hurry. Come on.
Which way?
SHE YELLS
Jesus Christ. You scared the shit out of me!
- Put the gun down.
- It's us!
- How do I know that?
- Put it down.
I'm gonna blow this ship. Come with us.
I got my own plan.
What the hell are you talking about?
Richie! Don't be a fool!
Richie!
Come on. Let's go.
That should do it.
Checkmate.
I gave us 15 minutes. We should warn Richie.
Richie, we're leaving the ship!

Richie...
Oh, man...
I thought you bailed on us, bro. I thought you weren't coming back.
Shows you how smart I am.
Hey, Steve...
There is still a way to get off this ship.
What?
But you got to get to the missile room.
Missile room?
You'll understand when you're there.
Steve...
Mason!
Mason!
Shit.
Nadia, stop!
Nadia!

Look at this! It's a rocket loader!
It's an ejection seat.
Let's go!
No!
Get in!
No!
I'm not going without you!
Get in! There's no time!
Richie rigged this for one. OK?
And you're it.
Let's go. Come on, come on!
