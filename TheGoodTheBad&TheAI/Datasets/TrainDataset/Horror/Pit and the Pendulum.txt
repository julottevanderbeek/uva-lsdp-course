YES?
I WISH TO SEE
DON MEDINA.
MY NAME--
I'M SORRY.
DON MEDINA IS NOT RECEIVING
VISITORS AT PRESENT.
YOU WILL ANNOUNCE
THAT MR. FRANCIS BARNARD
HAS COME FROM ENGLAND
TO SEE HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?
REMOVE YOUR HAND,
SIR.
Woman: MAXIMILLIAN.
WHAT IS IT?
THIS GENTLEMAN DEMANDS
TO BE ADMITTED, DO헤.
I TOLD HIM--
YOU ARE DO헤 MEDINA?
I AM.
I AM FRANCIS BARNARD,
ELIZABETH'S BROTHER.
OH, I'M SORRY.
WON'T YOU COME IN,
MR. BARNARD?
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I'M CATHERINE MEDINA.
DO헤.
WILL YOU NOT SPEND
THE NIGHT, MR. BARNARD?
I'M CERTAIN THAT
MY BROTHER WOULD WISH IT.
PERHAPS, DO헤. MAY I
SEE YOUR BROTHER NOW?
UH...
HE IS RESTING.
HE HAS NOT BEEN WELL
SINCE THE DEATH.
I SEE.
WHEN MAY I SEE HIM?
PERHAPS AT SUPPER...
IF YOU WOULD
DO US THE HONOR.
VERY WELL. AT SUPPER.
MAY I VISIT
MY SISTER'S GRAVE NOW?
GRAVE?
I PRESUME THERE IS ONE.
NOT AS SUCH, MR. BARNARD.
SHE IS INTERRED BELOW.
OH?
A FAMILY CUSTOM,
MR. BARNARD.
I SEE.
IF WE MAY
GO THERE, THEN?
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.
WHEN DID SHE DIE?
YOUR BROTHER'S LETTER
MADE NO MENTION OF THE DATE.
ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO.
NOT NOTIFIED SOONER?
I'M AFRAID I--
HOW DID SHE DIE?
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
OF THE DETAILS,
MR. BARNARD.
THIS IS NO LONGER
MY HOME, YOU SEE?
I LEFT IT SEVERAL
MONTHS BEFORE
NICHOLAS MARRIED
YOUR SISTER.
YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW--
IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN!
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
PLEASE FOLLOW ME,
MR. BARNARD.
NOT THAT WAY!
MR. BARNARD!
WHO ARE YOU?
THIS IS MR. BARNARD,
NICHOLAS.
ELIZABETH'S BROTHER.
OH, YES.
YOU ARE WELCOME,
SIR.
RESTING,
DO헤 MEDINA?
SIR?
I TOLD MR. BARNARD
THAT YOU WERE RESTING,
NICHOLAS.
I THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE.
THAT NOISE, SIR.
IT IS AN APPARATUS, SIR,
THAT MUST BE KEPT
IN CONSTANT REPAIR.
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO US?
ELIZABETH WAS MY SISTER,
DON MEDINA.
I RECEIVED A REPORT
OF HER UNTIMELY DEATH,
A REPORT WHICH WAS
UTTERLY DEVOID OF DETAILS.
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE,
REMAINED IN ENGLAND?
YES, YOU
ARE QUITE RIGHT.
MY APOLOGIES, SIR.
SHOCK AND...GRIEF...
RESTRAINED ME FROM MORE
ADEQUATE COMMUNICATION.
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE PROVOKED.
PERHAPS
YOU WILL SHOW ME
MY SISTER'S
PLACE OF INTERMENT NOW.
I TOLD HIM IT WOULD
BE ALL RIGHT,
NICHOLAS.
YES, OF COURSE.
NOW PERHAPS YOU'LL BE
GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL ME
HOW MY SISTER DIED.
AN ILLNESS
OF SOME DURATION, SIR.
AND WAS THIS ILLNESS
DIAGNOSED?
YES.
BY WHOM?
DR. LEON,
A PHYSICIAN OF REPUTE.
AND HE DECIDED?
SOMETHING
IN HER BLOOD.
YES?
THAT'S ALL?
JUST SOMETHING
IN HER BLOOD?
I'M AFRAID SO.
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT DOES NOT
SATISFY ME, SIR.
FOLLOW ME.
MAY WE GO NOW,
MR. BARNARD?
THIS IS VERY PAINFUL
FOR MY BROTHER.
AND FOR ME...
AS WELL.
THIS FORM OF BURIAL
IS A FAMILY CUSTOM,
MR. BARNARD.
WILL YOU STAY
THE NIGHT WITH US?
THE NIGHT...
AND MORE, SIR.
UNTIL I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
THANK YOU.
YES?
I TRUST THAT YOU WILL
BE COMFORTABLE HERE.
IS THIS YOU?
NO.
NO, THAT IS MY FATHER
SEBASTIAN MEDINA.
SEBASTIAN MEDINA.
YES.
THE RESEMBLANCE
IS REMARKABLE.
YES.
AND THE OTHER
IS MY UNCLE BARTOLOME.
MR. BARNARD, I'M AWARE--
PAINFULLY AWARE--
OF YOUR DISTRUST
REGARDING ELIZABETH'S DEATH.
HER DEATH WAS,
AND IS, ANGUISH TO ME.
I BEG OF YOU,
DO NOT ADD--
I'M SORRY,
DON MEDINA,
BUT YOUR WORD
IS NOT ENOUGH.
TOO MANY THINGS NEED
FULLER EXPLANATION
BEFORE I CAN
BE SATISFIED
THAT WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.
FULLER EXPLANATION?
YES.
COME WITH ME.
PLEASE COME.
THE ATMOSPHERE
IS HEAVY IN HERE.
WHY HAVE YOU
BROUGHT ME HERE?
IT IS HER ROOM, SIR.
I'VE HAD IT KEPT
EXACTLY AS SHE LEFT IT.
LOOK AROUND YOU, SIR.
THIS ROOM WAS
FURNISHED AND ARRANGED
WITH DEDICATED LOVE.
EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE,
EVERY DECORATIVE DETAIL
IS THE WORK
OF A MASTER CRAFTSMAN
OF ITALY OR SPAIN
OR FRANCE.
INDEED, EVERY COUNTRY
IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
IS REPRESENTED HERE.
IT IS A UNIQUE ROOM.
I DID IT ALL FOR HER.
I WANTED HER TO HAVE
SOMETHING THAT--
MARIA.
BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
I WAS JUST CLEANING UP.
OH, YES.
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU MAY GO NOW.
IS THIS ALL
YOU MEANT TO TELL ME?
YOU ARE AN UNYIELDING MAN,
MR. BARNARD.
I AM FORCED TO BE, SIR.
GOD AS MY WITNESS,
I WORSHIPPED YOUR SISTER.
I WORSHIP HER STILL.
WITHOUT HER,
LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.
SHE WAS THE VERY SUBSTANCE
OF LOVELINESS.
I TRIED TO CAPTURE IT,
BUT IT WAS THE WAY
SHE WALKED AND MOVED...
HER SMILE, HER VOICE.
SHE SANG LIKE AN ANGEL.
AND SHE COULD PLAY
THE HARPSICHORD
AS NO OTHER WOMAN I HAVE
EVER KNOWN COULD PLAY.
EVERY NIGHT
AFTER WE HAD DINED...
SHE WOULD PLAY FOR ME.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I HAD NOT INTENDED
TO SO DISPLAY MYSELF.
I ONLY WANTED
TO CONVINCE YOU.
NOW, PRAY, I...
BEG OF YOU TO
LEAVE ME FOR A WHILE.
PLEASE, GO.
DO YOU LIVE IN LONDON,
MR. BARNARD?
YES, AND YOU?
IN BARCELONA,
WITH AN AUNT.
AND, UH, HAVE YOU
BEEN HERE LONG?
A LITTLE OVER A WEEK.
I CAME TO BE WITH
NICHOLAS BECAUSE I--
WHO WOULD THAT BE?
NICHOLAS.
HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND?
PALE.
SLEPT BADLY, HAVE YOU?
CHARLES,
WE HAVE A VISITOR.
WELL. SPLENDID,
SPLENDID.
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED.
CHARLES.
IT'S ELIZABETH'S
BROTHER.
OH?
YOU MEAN, HE'S--
YES.
DR. CHARLES LEON AT
YOUR SERVICE, SIR.
DOCTOR.
YOU ARE,
I UNDERSTAND,
ELIZABETH'S BROTHER.
THE RESEMBLANCE
IS CLEAR.
THE COLORING,
THE SAME
CONFIGURATION.
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
YOUR SISTER.
DOCTOR.
AH, MY DEAR.
I'VE INTERRUPTED
YOUR MEAL, I SEE.
PROPER TIMING
WAS NEVER MY FORTE.
WE'VE JUST FINISHED.
WON'T YOU JOIN US
IN GLASS OF WINE,
CHARLES?
DELIGHTED.
SO, YOUNG GENTLEMAN,
YOU'VE COME ALL THE WAY
FROM ENGLAND?
THAT'S RIGHT.
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY,
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH.
APPALLING BUSINESS.
HOW ARE THINGS
IN BAZTAN, CHARLES?
WHAT?
OH, AS ALWAYS, NICHOLAS,
BUYING AND SELLING,
LIVING AND DYING.
THE WEAVE OF LIFE.
WHY DID MY SISTER
DIE, DR. LEON?
HAVE YOU NOT
BEEN TOLD?
OF COURSE HE HAS.
WELL, THEN.
I WANT TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU, DOCTOR.
HER...DEATH WAS
INEVITABLE, I FEAR...
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES--
THIS CASTLE,
THIS ODIOUS ATMOSPHERE.
WHAT HAS THE CASTLE
TO DO WITH IT?
WHAT HAS THE CASTLE--
IT'S TOO LATE NOW,
CHARLES. I...
I DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO KNOW.
KNOW WHAT?
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH
WAS CAUSED BY FAILURE
OF THE HEART, SIR,
DUE TO TOTAL SHOCK.
LITERALLY,
SHE DIED OF FRIGHT.
WHY DID YOU
NOT TELL ME?
I THOUGHT
TO SPARE YOU, SIR.
YOU THOUGHT
TO DECEIVE ME!
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
SHOW ME WHERE
IT HAPPENED.
VERY WELL.
NO, NICHOLAS.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY,
MY DEAR.
WE WERE WRONG...
VERY WRONG TO HAVE KEPT
THE TRUTH FROM MR. BARNARD.
NOW WE ARE DOUBLY
SUSPECT IN HIS EYES.
SUSPECT?
COME.
NICHOLAS, YOU SHOULD NOT
BE DOING THIS, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT WELL.
IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED,
CHARLES.
COME.
WELL?
Francis:
A TORTURE CHAMBER?
YES, MR. BARNARD.
IT WAS MY FATHER'S.
SEBASTIAN MEDINA.
ONE OF THE INQUISITION'S
MOST INFAMOUS DEGRADED--
PLEASE, SIR.
THAT IS ENOUGH.
MR. BARNARD,
CAN YOU NOT SEE--
WHAT WAS MY SISTER
DOING HERE?
SHE COULD NOT
KEEP HERSELF AWAY.
THAT NOISE I HEARD.
IS THAT WHAT WAS--
NO, SIR. THAT
PARTICULAR DEVICE
WAS NOT IN OPERATION
AT THE TIME.
WHICH DEVICE?
IT'S IN AN ADJOINING
CHAMBER DOWN THERE.
PLEASE, MR. BARNARD,
DO NOT GO THERE. I...
I DO NOT WISH
TO DISCUSS IT.
THE STORY, SIR.
IN DETAIL.
THIS WAS MY FATHER'S WORLD,
MR. BARNARD.
SPARE YOURSELF
AT LEAST THIS, NICHOLAS.
HOW CAN I SPARE MYSELF?
WAS HE NOT
MY FATHER?
AM I NOT THE SPAWN
OF HIS...
HIS DEPRAVED BLOOD.
HIS DEPRAVITY
IS NOT YOURS, NICHOLAS.
WHY SCOURGE YOURSELF
BECAUSE OF IT?
YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED ME,
DON MEDINA.
I SHALL NOT DWELL UPON
THE HISTORY OF THIS...
THIS BLASPHEMOUS
CHAMBER.
SUFFICE IT THAT THE BLOOD
OF A THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN
WAS SPILLED
WITHIN THESE WALLS.
LIMBS TWISTED
AND BROKEN!
EYES GOUGED
FROM BLOODY SOCKETS,
FLESH BURNED BLACK.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
THESE THINGS?
WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO
WITH MY SISTER?
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BROUGHT HER HERE.
SHE WAS TOO SENSITIVE,
TOO AWARE.
AWARE OF WHAT?
THE MALIGNANT ATMOSPHERE
OF THIS CASTLE.
IT DESTROYED HER.
MY SISTER WAS A STRONG
AND WILLFUL WOMAN,
NOT SUBJECT
TO THE INFLUENCE
OF ATMOSPHERES.
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY
A MATTER OF HOURS, MR. BARNARD.
YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT IS
TO LIVE HERE...
MONTH UPON MONTH,
YEAR AFTER YEAR...
BREATHING THIS INFERNAL AIR,
ABSORBING THE MIASMA
OF BARBARITY
WHICH PERMEATES THESE WALLS,
PARTICULARLY THIS CHAMBER,
BUT IT DID NOT BOTHER HER
AT FIRST, EITHER.
OUR LIFE WAS GOOD...
RICH WITH THE SHARED
PLEASURES OF OUR LOVE.
Nicholas: EACH MORNING
I WOULD BRING HER BREAKFAST.
IN THE AFTERNOONS,
SHE USUALLY SAT FOR ME
WHILE I ATTEMPTED ALL IN VAIN
TO CAPTURE HER BEAUTY
ON CANVAS.
I DID THAT PORTRAIT WHICH
YOU SAW IN HER ROOM BEFORE,
BUT IT IS ALL INADEQUATE
TO RECALL THE LOVELINESS OF HER.
WE DINED, SOMETIMES ALONE,
ENJOYING INTIMATE CONVERSATION,
SOMETIMES WITH THE DOCTOR.
AND EVERY NIGHT,
ELIZABETH WOULD PLAY FOR ME.
LIFE WAS SIMPLE, QUIET,
RICHLY PLEASURABLE,
AND THEN THE DARKNESS
BEGAN TO FALL.
MORE AND MORE, ENTERING
HER ROOM IN THE MORNINGS,
I WOULD FIND HER AWAKE
AND DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD
NOT SLEPT ALL THE NIGHT.
I TRIED TO FIND OUT WHY,
BUT SHE HAD NO EXPLANATION.
HER APPETITE BEGAN TO FADE.
SHE BEGAN TO LOSE
WEIGHT AND COLOR.
I TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT,
BUT SOMETHING
KEPT HER FROM IT.
I WOULD COME UPON HER
WANDERING IN THE CORRIDORS
AT NIGHT.
I TRIED TO FIND OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG,
BUT SHE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER,
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SOMETHING
WAS OPPRESSING HER.
OH, GOD, HELP ME
FOR MY BLINDNESS.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.
THEN ONE DAY
SHE DISAPPEARED.
FRANTIC, I SEARCHED
THE CASTLE FOR HER.
AND THEN I KNEW.
THE CASTLE AND ITS AWFUL HISTORY
HAD OBSESSED HER.
THESE VERY
INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE,
WHICH WERE MY BIRTHRIGHT
AND MY CURSE,
NOW TORMENTED HER AS WELL,
INFECTING HER WITH A KIND
OF HAUNTED FASCINATION.
I WATCHED HER DRAWN TO ONE
AND THEN ANOTHER
AS IF THE AURA OF PAIN AND
SUFFERING WHICH SURROUNDED THEM
WAS LURING HER TO SICKNESS
AND TO DEATH.
IMMEDIATELY, I MADE MY PLANS
TO LEAVE THE CASTLE WITH HER.
WE WOULD TRAVEL FOR A WHILE,
RESTORE HER SPIRITS,
AND THEN MAKE OUR HOME
ELSEWHERE.
THEN ON THE VERY EVE
OF OUR DEPARTURE...
WE HEARD A SCREAM
FROM BELOW,
THE MOST HIDEOUS
BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAM
I HAVE EVER HEARD
IN MY LIFE.
JUST BEFORE SHE DIED,
SHE WHISPERED A NAME.
SEBASTIAN.
SEBASTIAN.
SEBASTIAN.
MR. BARNARD.
DO헤.
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?
YES, OF COURSE.
HOW IS
YOUR BROTHER?
BETTER, THANK YOU.
DR. LEON
IS STAYING WITH HIM.
I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU
TO PLEASE BELIEVE HIM,
MR. BARNARD.
HE HAS TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH.
HAS HE?
YES.
IN NOT TELLING YOU
BEFORE,
HE ONLY MEANT
TO SPARE YOU PAIN.
HE IS A GOOD MAN,
MR. BARNARD,
A KIND AND GENTLE MAN,
AND I KNOW THAT
HE ADORED YOUR SISTER.
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE HIM,
DO헤 MEDINA,
BUT I FIND IT
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
I CANNOT HELP BUT SENSE,
A KIND OF FEARFUL
TENSION THAT--
I'M SORRY...
BUT AN AIR
OF DEFINITE GUILT.
OF COURSE HE SUFFERS
FROM GUILT, MR. BARNARD,
BECAUSE OF
WHAT OUR FATHER DID,
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED TO ELIZABETH.
PERHAPS IT WILL HELP
YOU TO UNDERSTAND
IF I TELL YOU
SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED
TO NICHOLAS
WHEN HE WAS
JUST A BOY.
ONE DAY, WHILE
NICHOLAS WAS PLAYING
IN THE LOWER
CORRIDOR...
Catherine: HE HAD BEEN
FORBIDDEN BY OUR FATHER
TO ENTER THIS CHAMBER
AT ANY TIME.
THE CURIOSITY OF YOUTH,
HOWEVER,
OVERCAME HIS FEAR OF CHALLENGING
OUR FATHER'S DISCIPLINE.
HE HAD TO SEE THE CHAMBER.
SUDDENLY,
THERE WERE FOOTSTEPS.
IT WAS OUR FATHER.
WITH HIM WERE OUR MOTHER
AND OUR UNCLE BARTOLOME,
WHO WAS
OUR FATHER'S BROTHER.
AT FIRST, IT APPEARED THAT
FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON
OUR FATHER WAS ACTUALLY
CONDUCTING THEM
ON A TOUR
OF HIS GHASTLY CHAMBER.
NICHOLAS COULD SEE THAT
BOTH OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE
WERE UNEASY, FRIGHTENED.
OUR FATHER'S
SMILING AFFABILITY
AS HE DESCRIBED THE WORKINGS
OF THESE HELLISH INSTRUMENTS
TURNED NICHOLAS' BLOOD COLD.
HE WATCHED THEM WITH
A MOUNTING SENSE OF PREMONITION.
SOMETHING WAS WRONG,
MOST TERRIBLY WRONG.
EVEN HE, NO MORE
THAN 10 YEARS OF AGE,
COULD SENSE IT LIKE
A DARKENING VAPOR IN THE AIR.
THERE WAS NO REASON
FOR OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE
TO HAVE BEEN THERE.
AAH!
Catherine: AS HE STRUCK,
HE KEPT ON SCREAMING
AT HIS BROTHER ONE WORD
OVER AND OVER--
"ADULTERER! ADULTERER!"
AND THEN HE TURNED ON HER.
AAH!
Catherine: ACCUSING HER
OF VILE DEBAUCHERIES
WITH HIS BROTHER,
CURSING HER AS FAITHLESS,
PROMISING HER
THE AGONIES OF HELL
AND PAYMENT
FOR HER INFIDELITY,
AND THERE BEFORE
MY BROTHER'S VERY EYES,
OUR MOTHER
WAS TORTURED TO DEATH.
EVER SINCE THEN,
NICHOLAS HAS BEEN UNABLE
TO LIVE AS OTHER MEN.
ALWAYS, HE IS HAUNTED
BY THE MEMORY
OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY.
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH
CAME VERY CLOSE
TO DRIVING HIM INSANE,
MR. BARNARD.
I BEG OF YOU,
HAVE PITY ON HIM.
HELP HIM
BY BELIEVING HIM.
I WILL TRY,
DO헤 MEDINA.
WELL, I KNOW YOU
MUST BE VERY TIRED
FROM YOUR JOURNEY.
GOOD NIGHT.
DO헤.
WHO IS THAT?
I'LL SEE.
WHERE IS NICHOLAS?
HE IS GONE?
I MUST'VE DOZED OFF
IN THAT CHAIR,
AND THEN I HEARD--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SURELY IT'S YOUR BROTHER.
NO, NICHOLAS
HAS NEVER PLAYED
THE HARPSICHORD
IN HIS LIFE.
MARIA.
I--I HEARD
THE PLAYING, SIR.
GO BACK TO BED, CHILD.
COME ON.
NICHOLAS!
IT WAS ELIZABETH.
YOU SAW HER?
I DID NOT
HAVE TO SEE HER.
I KNOW HER PLAYING.
LOCKED?
YES.
IS THERE ANOTHER DOOR?
THERE IS NOT, SIR.
MY SISTER'S?
EASY, EASY, EASY.
IT WAS SHE.
DRINK THIS.
THANK YOU.
HERS?
YES.
HE'LL SLEEP
IN A MINUTE OR SO.
DOCTOR, WILL YOU
STAY, PLEASE?
YES, OF COURSE, MY DEAR.
UNTIL THE MORNING,
AT ANY RATE.
MY DEAR LORD.
IT IS HERS,
ISN'T IT?
IT IS.
BUT HOW?
LET US NOT TALK HERE.
MAY WE USE
YOUR ROOM, SIR?
YES, OF COURSE.
SIT.
WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU
NO ONE IN THIS WORLD EXCEPT
NICHOLAS AND MYSELF KNOWS.
THAT IS, I THOUGHT THAT
NO ONE ELSE KNEW.
TAKE THIS.
NO.
DRINK IT.
TO BE ABSOLUTELY
BLUNT ABOUT IT,
NICHOLAS BELIEVES
THAT ELIZABETH
MAY HAVE BEEN
INTERRED PREMATURELY.
WHAT?
I HASTEN TO
ASSURE YOU BOTH
THAT SUCH
IS NOT THE CASE.
ELIZABETH
WAS QUITE DEAD.
I WOULD STAKE
MY REPUTATION
ON THAT FACT.
THEN WHY--
DOES HE BELIEVE IT?
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIS MOTHER
MANY YEARS AGO.
I'M AFRAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I TOLD MR. BARNARD
WHAT NICHOLAS SAW THAT DAY.
NO, MY DEAR.
YOUR MOTHER WAS NOT
TORTURED TO DEATH
AS YOU WERE TOLD.
BUT--
SHE WAS TORTURED,
YES...
BUT NOT TO DEATH.
DO I MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR?
DO YOU MEAN
TO SAY THAT--
YOUR MOTHER WAS
WALLED UP IN HER TOMB...
WHILE YET ALIVE.
OH, NO.
FROM THAT DAY FORTH,
THE VERY THOUGHT
OF PREMATURE INTERMENT
WAS ENOUGH
TO DRIVE YOUR BROTHER
INTO CONVULSIONS
OF HORROR.
NICHOLAS BROODS ABOUT IT
CONSTANTLY.
ALREADY HE HAS TOLD ME
HE HAS HEARD ELIZABETH
WALKING THE CORRIDORS,
EVEN THAT HE HAS HEARD
HER SPEAKING HIS NAME.
DR. LEON.
SIR?
YOU SEEM TO FORGET
THAT WE ALL
HEARD THE HARPSICHORD
PLAYING.
NO, I HAVE NOT
FORGOTTEN IT, SIR.
IT IS WHY I SAID BEFORE
THAT I THOUGHT
THAT NO ONE BUT NICHOLAS
AND MYSELF KNEW ABOUT THIS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SOMEONE, I FEAR, HAS
DISCOVERED NICHOLAS' SECRET
AND IS USING IT
AS A TERRIBLE ADVANTAGE.
A SERVANT, PERHAPS.
I COULD ALMOST
MORE EASILY BELIEVE THAT--
THAT WHAT, DO헤 MEDINA?
NOTHING.
I SPOKE
WITHOUT THOUGHT.
I WANT TO KNOW
ONE THING, SIR.
ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE...
THAT DON MEDINA'S
DREAD IS UNWARRANTED?
IF ELIZABETH MEDINA
WALKS THE CORRIDORS
OF THIS CASTLE,
IT IS HER SPIRIT,
NOT HER LIVING SELF.
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
ELIZABETH'S ROOM.
AAH!
WHAT IS IT, CHILD?
Charles:
EASY, CHILD.
EASY.
TELL US WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.
I--
I HEARD HER.
HEARD?
THE MISTRESS.
I WAS CLEANING UP
THE ROOM,
AND SHE SPOKE TO ME.
SHE CALLED ME
BY MY NAME--MARIA.
SHE SAID, "MARIA,
LEAVE THIS ROOM!"
MY WIFE
SPOKE TO YOU?
MY WIFE SPOKE--
NICHOLAS!
NO ONE WILL EVER
ENTER THAT ROOM AGAIN.
MR. BARNARD, I'M--
NO NEED EXPLAINING,
NICHOLAS.
MR. BARNARD
KNOWS EVERYTHING.
TAKE CARE OF THE GIRL,
WILL YOU, CATHERINE?
I'LL SEE TO HER,
DO헤 MEDINA,
IF YOU WANT TO GO
WITH YOUR BROTHER.
THANK YOU.
COME, MARIA, LET ME
HELP YOU DOWNSTAIRS.
PERHAPS I
SHOULD BRING
SOME FOOD
TO NICHOLAS.
HE WILL NOT EAT IT,
MY DEAR,
ANY MORE THAN YOU
ARE EATING YOURS.
I'M NOT
HUNGRY.
YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH,
NONETHELESS.
IF I MAY INTERRUPT THIS
FASCINATING CONVERSATION
FOR A MOMENT,
HOW LONG, MAY I ASK,
DO YOU INTEND TO ACCEPT
THESE OCCURRENCES
AT FACE VALUE?
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT,
MR. BARNARD,
THAT A MAN OF
YOUR INVESTIGATIVE ZEAL
WOULD HAVE ALREADY
SOLVED THE MYSTERY.
AND HAVE YOU,
DOCTOR?
I AM NOT CERTAIN.
BUT YOU DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY HEARD
ELIZABETH'S VOICE?
WE HAVE ONLY
MARIA'S WORD FOR IT.
WE PROCEED ON
SIMILAR LINES, DOCTOR.
IN QUESTIONING MARIA,
I ASKED HER TO DESCRIBE
THE VOICE SHE HEARD.
AND?
SHE COULD NOT
DESCRIBE IT, DOCTOR,
BECAUSE IT ONLY
WHISPERED TO HER.
THIS POINT SEEMS OF VITAL
IMPORT TO YOU, DOES IT?
DON MEDINA!
DON MEDINA!
THE KEY TO
ELIZABETH'S ROOM.
THE KEY, I SAID!
AGAIN?
DO NOT GO THERE,
NICHOLAS.
I MUST, CATHERINE.
NICHOLAS!
NICHOLAS!
COME.
WHAT I HAVE DREADED
ALL THESE MONTHS...
HAS COME TO PASS.
YOU ARE WRONG,
NICHOLAS.
NO. NO, SHE HAUNTS ME
BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE THING
I DID TO HER--
MR. BARNARD!
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF HEAVEN?
AND HAVE YOU NOTHING
TO SAY, DON MEDINA?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR.
DO YOU NOT, SIR?
THEN, WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU.
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?
THE MEANING, DOCTOR,
IS THIS--
ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THIS CASTLE
COULD HAVE CAUSED ALL THESE
INEXPLICABLE OCCURRENCES.
THAT PERSON IS DON MEDINA.
WHAT?
YOU'RE MAD, SIR.
AM I?
MR. BARNARD,
I SWEAR THAT I--
THIS SECRET PASSAGE, SIR,
HOW CONVENIENT FOR YOU.
ENABLING YOU TO WHISPER
TO MARIA WITHOUT BEING SEEN.
THEN AFTER THE DOOR TO
ELIZABETH'S ROOM
HAD BEEN LOCKED BY
ENABLING YOU TO RETURN THERE
AND AT YOUR LEISURE,
DEMOLISH EVERYTHING.
YOU ARE WRONG, SIR.
I SWEAR I--
YOU ARE LYING, SIR!
WHEN MARIA SCREAMED,
WHERE WERE YOU?
WHEN ELIZABETH'S ROOM
WAS BEING TORN APART,
WHERE WERE YOU?
WHY WERE YOU NOT
INVESTIGATING THAT?
I--I WAS AFRAID.
YOU LIE!
BOTH TIMES WERE IN
ELIZABETH'S ROOM YOURSELF!
BOTH TIMES YOUR OWN DOOR
WAS LOCKED,
PROTECTING YOU
FROM DISCOVERY!
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!
WHY SHOULD NICHOLAS
DO THESE THINGS?
WHY?
IS IT POSSIBLE?
POSSIBLE I AM
DOING THESE THINGS
UNAWARE?
TO PUNISH MYSELF?
NO, NICHOLAS, NO!
ONE OF THE SERVANTS
IS RESPONSIBLE.
MOST LIKELY MARIA.
COULD I HAVE KEPT THAT RING
WITHOUT KNOWING IT?
PLAYED THE HARPSICHORD
WITHOUT KNOWING IT?
DESTROYED ELIZABETH'S ROOM
ALL WITHOUT KNOWING IT?
MY INNER MIND...
CREATING EVIDENCE OF
ELIZABETH'S VENGEFUL RETURN
BECAUSE THAT MIND KNOWS...
BUT I DON'T KNOW!
I WILL FIND OUT.
NO.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY,
CATHERINE.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
I MUST BE SURE!
I MUST BE SURE.
CAN YOU NOT STOP THIS?
I DO NOT BELIEVE
I WISH TO STOP IT,
MY DEAR.
IF THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
OF CONVINCING NICHOLAS
THAT HE DID NOT
BURY HIS WIFE ALIVE,
THEN I SAY
BY ALL MEANS DO IT.
THIS GROUNDLESS DREAD
MUST FINALLY
BE PUT TO REST.
WE WILL EXHUME ELIZABETH.
TRUE.
TRUE!
I SWEAR TO YOU
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD.
ON MY HONOR AS A PHYSICIAN,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD.
I SWEAR TO YOU!
TRUE.
TRUE.
TRUE.
TRUE!
NICHOLAS!
NO, NICHOLAS!
TRUE!
NICHOLAS!
I KILLED HER.
I KILLED HER.
NO, NICHOLAS.
I KILLED HER.
I KILLED HER.
NICHOLAS.
I WOULD SUGGEST,
NICHOLAS,
THAT YOU LEAVE
THIS PLACE.
YOUR REMAINING HERE
CANNOT HELP ELIZABETH NOW.
TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
NICHOLAS.
I AM A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE.
NEVER IN MY CAREER
HAVE I SEEN A CONDITION
WHICH SO COMPLETELY
PARALLELED
THE PHYSICAL
APPEARANCE OF DEATH.
YOU CANNOT FEEL
RESPONSIBLE, NICHOLAS.
WHILE WE WERE UP HERE
MOURNING HER,
SHE WAS ALIVE,
STRUGGLING TO BE FREE.
I AM RESPONSIBLE.
IF IT WERE NOT SO,
SHE WOULD NOT WANT
TO HAUNT ME.
SHE DOES NOT HAUNT YOU,
NICHOLAS.
CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT?
IT IS YOU
PUNISHING YOURSELF.
I MUST LEAVE IN THE MORNING.
ALREADY I HAVE BEEN
GROSSLY NEGLIGENT
OF MY OTHER PATIENTS.
I BEG OF YOU...
LEAVE WITH ME.
I CAN NEVER LEAVE.
I MUST ACCEPT
WHATEVER VENGEANCE
ELIZABETH CHOOSES
TO INFLICT UPON ME.
DO헤 MEDINA?
DO헤 MEDINA?
WHAT IS IT,
MR. BARNARD?
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?
CERTAINLY.
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.
APOLOGIZE?
BUT EVERYTHING
YOU SAID--
I KNOW THAT MY SUSPICIONS
WERE JUSTIFIED,
BUT NOT AS I HAD EXPECTED.
I REALIZE NOW
THAT MY SISTER'S DEATH
WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I DO NOT BLAME
YOUR BROTHER.
I FEEL ONLY
SYMPATHY FOR HIM.
WHAT I DID WAS, I ASSURE YOU,
ONLY BECAUSE OF ELIZABETH.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.
I'M SORRY THAT OUR MEETING
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE
UNDER SUCH UNHAPPY
CIRCUMSTANCES.
HAD THINGS
BEEN OTHERWISE...
PERHAPS WE SHALL
MEET AGAIN...
IN BARCELONA.
I HOPE SO.
GOOD NIGHT, DO헤.
GOOD NIGHT.
DOCTOR.
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING, SIR?
TO APOLOGIZE TO
DON MEDINA.
I WOULDN'T SPEAK
TO HIM JUST NOW.
HE IS MUCH
OVERWROUGHT.
IN THE MORNING,
PERHAPS.
YOU WILL BE
LEAVING THEN?
YES.
WILL YOU ACCEPT
THE HOSPITALITY
OF MY CARRIAGE?
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT,
MR. BARNARD.
Elizabeth:
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
WHERE ARE YOU?
ELIZABETH?
WHERE ARE YOU?
OH.
NICHOLAS?
NICHOLAS?
IS MY BROTHER WITH YOU?
NO. IS HE NOT
IN HIS ROOM?
NO.
HE MUST BE
WITH DR. LEON, THEN.
I WILL CHECK BELOW.
YOU TWO SEARCH THIS FLOOR
AND THE ONE ABOVE.
ALL RIGHT.
IS THAT YOU?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
HUH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
OHH...
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT.
I COULDN'T.
HE'S GONE.
WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER?
HE'S SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
IN THE MORNING,
BUT NOW...
WHY COULDN'T YOU WAIT
ONE MORE DAY?
I'VE WAITED
TOO LONG ALREADY.
SO, MY DARLING NICHOLAS,
WE'VE BROKEN YOU AT LAST.
ELIZABETH,
THERE IS NO TIME FOR THIS.
I'VE WAITED AN ETERNITY
FOR THIS MOMENT.
THERE HAS TO BE TIME.
AND NOW, MY DEAR NICHOLAS,
I HAVE YOU EXACTLY
AS I WANT YOU...
HELPLESS.
ELIZABETH.
IS IT NOT IRONICAL,
MY HUSBAND?
YOUR WIFE, AN ADULTERESS.
YOUR MOTHER,
AN ADULTERESS.
YOUR UNCLE, AN ADULTERER.
YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND,
AN ADULTERER.
DO YOU NOT FIND THAT AMUSING,
DEAR NICHOLAS?
YES.
YES.
YES.
YES!
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM?
HAPPENING?
WHY, WHAT SHOULD
BE HAPPENING, ISABELLA?
ISABELLA?
YOU, BARTOLOME,
MY BROTHER,
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY LITTLE WORKSHOP, HUH?
DEAR GOD.
WHY, WHAT AILS YOU,
BROTHER?
AND YOU, MY DEAR,
WHY ARE YOU SO PALE?
DOES THIS PLACE
DISTURB YOU?
HEH. I THOUGHT
THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD ENJOY
THE NOVELTY OF IT.
COME, LET ME SHOW YOU
ABOUT A BIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
ISABELLA? BARTOLOME!
ARE YOU LEAVING ME?
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE MY--
I'M GOING TO TORTURE YOU,
ISABELLA.
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU SUFFER
FOR YOUR FAITHLESSNESS TO ME.
BEFORE THIS DAY IS OUT,
YOU WILL BE BEGGING ME
TO KILL YOU.
TO RELIEVE YOU
OF THE AGONY OF HELL
INTO WHICH YOUR HUSBAND
IS ABOUT TO PLUNGE YOU.
HARLOT!
YOU WILL DIE IN AGONY!
DIE!
AAH!
NOW, BARTOLOME,
MY BROTHER...
YAAH!
AAH!
BARTOLOME!
BARTOLOME!
WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU CANNOT HIDE
FROM ME, YOU KNOW.
DON MEDINA?
DON MEDINA!
THERE YOU ARE,
BARTOLOME!
OH, THERE YOU ARE, SIR.
WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.
AND NOW FOR YOU, BARTOLOME,
MY BELOVED BROTHER,
WHILE YOU ARE STILL ALIVE,
MY ULTIMATE
DEVICE OF TORTURE.
ARE YOU READY NOW,
BARTOLOME?
BARTOLOME?
NOW WE ARE READY
TO BEGIN, BARTOLOME.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOU ARE, BARTOLOME?
DON MEDINA,
I AM FRANCIS BARNARD.
I WILL TELL YOU
WHERE YOU ARE.
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER
HELL, BARTOLOME.
HELL!
THE NETHER WORLD.
THE INFERNAL REGION.
THE ABODE OF THE DAMNED.
THE PLACE OF TORMENT.
PANDEMONIUM.
ABBADON! TOPHET!
GEHENNA!
NARAKA! THE PIT!
AND THE PENDULUM.
THE RAZOR EDGE
OF DESTINY.
THUS THE CONDITION OF MAN...
BOUND ON AN ISLAND FROM WHICH
HE CAN NEVER HOPE TO ESCAPE...
SURROUNDED BY
THE WAITING PIT OF HELL...
SUBJECT TO THE INEXORABLE
PENDULUM OF FATE!
WHICH MUST
DESTROY HIM FINALLY.
NICHOLAS?
NICHOLAS,
ARE YOU IN THERE?
CATHERINE!
HELP ME! HELP--
NICHOLAS?
NICHOLAS!
NICHOLAS!
OH, NO!
MAXIMILLIAN!
MAXIMILLIAN, WE MUST BREAK INTO
THE TORTURE CHAMBER! QUICKLY!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
MAXIMILLIAN!
DON MEDINA--HE THOUGHT
THAT I WAS...
SHH.
IT'S OVER NOW.
NICHOLAS.
Catherine: NO ONE WILL
EVER ENTER THIS ROOM AGAIN.
