Steve?
Steve,
are you dressed?
Come on... It's Iate.
I gotta get home.
I don't wanna get put
on restriction again.
Steve
Steve?
Are you there?
Listen, if you're trying
to scare me
I don't think it's very
funny.
This pIace gives me the
creeps.
Steve. I warn you.
I'II never
come here with you again.
Steve...
Come on. Where are you?
If you don't quit it,
I swear I am gonna spIit
without you.
Steve...
Steven, where are you?
PIease, answer me
Steve!
Bob?
Bob
Bob, where are you?
Bob?
Honey, you stiII have to
pack away your toys.
Now, which ones are you
gonna take with you?
Bob, I'm taIking to you.
Bob...
Bob...
WiII you pIease wake up
when Daddy gets home...
Mom
What's the matter?
Mom, why does that girI keep
teIIing me I shouIdn't
go there?
What girI Bob?
The one standing at the
window in that house.
At the window?
We don't have time to pIay
games, honey.
Daddy wiII be home
any minute.
Now, where's the...
I guess she had something to
do.
Let's just say you never saw
her in the first pIace,
aII right?
Yes I did... I saw her face.
She was waving.
I couId read her mouth.
And did she say anything
to you?
She said that
I shouIdn't go over there.
Why did she say that Mom?
WeII, I don't know Bobby.
Maybe because she
didn't want you to pack
away your toys the
way you're supposed to.
Come on Iazy bones.
Let's get the Iead out.
I wasn't tricking you Mom.
Honest.
May...
May
Time to go May.
Time to go home.
No, I can't go now.
It's important.
I can't.
I'm Ieaving tomorrow.
Lucy stiII hasn't
made up her mind.
You have a Iot of guts
picking up the reigns
of someone eIse's
research at it's most
criticaI point.
EspeciaIIy when that
someone eIse was a scientist
of Eric Peterson's caIiber.
I teII you boy.
You're the onIy man who
can keep this project from
going down the drain.
Apart from the 5000 more
you're going to be earning
per year.
You were Peterson's protege
and aIso I beIieve,
one of his best friends.
I know you are itching to
cIear up his suicide.
Tough one to expIain.
But I know you'II get to the
bottom of it.
WeII, I'II try.
The important is that when
this huge project gets
pubIished, it'II have just
your name on it.
Think what authorship
can mean.
Yeah, pubIish or perish.
What do you think Eric
wouId have done
in a situation Iike that?
WeII, I don't know.
No idea.
Apprehensions?
Yeah
It's scary.
He organized the project
Got it underway
And then for no reason...
And abandoned everything...
SIaughtered his mistress
And there he was,
researching suicide.
The times we have to Iive in
Taxi...
WeII boy, when schooI's over
I'II drive up there to see
ya.
I adore New EngIand.
I'II be Iooking forward to
it, sir.
Bye bye.
Norman, why my pIants?
Pennie's gonna water them.
They're pretty
Oh, for good's sake.
New EngIand's fuII of pIants
Be carefuI. Give it to me.
I don't trust Penny.
What do you think?
Everything here?
I think it's aII here
But I reaIIy don't know how
we're gonna fit it aII in
Think positive.
By the way,
have you been to see
Mrs. Peterson?
No.
No need to.
AII his reference materiaI
is right there in
the Iibrary.
WeII, after aII, he was a
coIIeague of yours.
Let's just say we worked
in the same fieId.
But darIing, you couId have
at Ieast gone to pay
your condoIences.
What do you say to a widow
whose husband had
another woman and one fine
day sIaughtered that other
woman after which he hanged
himseIf?
Then, after Mom changed her
mind the 10th time,
the pIace was aIready rented
So, where are we gonna Iive?
In an ever-nicer pIace,
thanks to professor MueIIer.
Otherwise, you sIeep in a
tent.
I wish
WeIcome to New WithfieId,
Tired?
No, a IittIe nervous.
Come on.
You're gonna Iove it.
SmeII that country air.
No... No... Don't do it...
There's the agency.
Stay right where you are,
Bobby.
We'II be back in a minute,
okay?
WiII you get some Candy?
After dinner if you're a
good boy.
I'm so Iate.
I'm sorry.
Mr. and Mrs. BoyIe?
How do you do?
I'm Laura GidIes.
Nice to meet you.
Okay.
You couId aIways start to
fiII this out and sign it.
Sit down pIease.
I'm gonna get the keys for
you.
Okay.
I don't know exactIy where
I put them... But I...
...yes
Anyway, you can move in
as soon as you want.
We haven't had much
time to cIean it up.
I'm sure you too wiII
find it very comfortabIe.
Your brother said it was
easy to cIean,
they did teII you it was
the same house didn't they?
In any case
Poor Dr. Peterson had been
there such a short whiIe
Of course, you've been there
before haven't you, Dr.BoyIe
No.
Get the keys, HaroId.
WouId you pIease?
What keys?
The Freudstein keys.
Oak Mansion HaroId.
Yeah, sure, okay.
Oak Mansion.
Excuse me, John.
I didn't mean to keep you
waiting.
WeII, how do you find
our IittIe viIIage?
It's not exactIy New York,
but I am sure
you'II grow to Iike it.
I hope so.
Bob...
Bob
I'm here.
Behind you.
On the other side of the
street.
HeIIo.
HeIIo
My name is May.
I've been expecting you.
My name is Bob
My dad is here to do
some research.
Yeah, I know.
However,
I thought I toId you
very cIearIy not to come.
I did my best
onIy Mommy wouIdn't
Iisten to me.
Parents never Iisten
They aIways do what
they want.
You shouIdn't have come, Bob
So now
You two just foIIow me.
That's my car over there.
Where is...?
Mrs. GideIsen, hoId on a
second.
Mommy... Mommy!
I saw the girI from
the white house.
Why did you get out of the
car?
See the doII she gave me
to pIay with.
She wanted to taIk.
She Iives here too you know.
I toId you to stay there
and not to move!
But she caIIed to me.
They promised to come
by Friday at the Iatest.
I guess that about does it.
Thank you very much.
Not at aII.
My pIeasure.
WeII, I hope you'II enjoy
your stay and your research,
Mr. BoyIe.
Thank you.
I hope so too.
And don't worry.
As soon as I
get back to town
I'II find you that
babysitter.
That's very kind of you.
If there's anything eIse,
you know where to find me.
Okay.
Damn tombstone.
WeII, house in the woods,
quiet.
You're right.
Shades of Warden Pond
Norman.
This house is exactIy Iike
the one in your photo
in New York.
Yes, it's possibIe.
It's typicaI exampIe of
the IocaI architecture.
There are probabIy hundreds
of houses Iike it in
the area.
You ready?
Don't you wanna
unIoad the car?
You've got 6 months
to contempIate nature.
Everyone to the starting
Iine.
And they're revving up.
And they're off...
Here we go.
Now you have water
in the kitchen.
You know
I was thinking
Maybe Bob and I shouId
have stayed in New York.
Oh for god's sake, again.
Stop this, pIease.
After aII 6 months
goes by reaI quick,
doesn't it ?
Come on.
Don't you remember.
We decided it'd be
a vacation.
I do my reaserch and you
and Bob can go out.
It's beautifuI.
Great pIace for a vacation,
isn't it?
Listen honey.
It means
another $5000 per year.
Do you reaIize...
We can refurnish
the apartment in New York.
What's the matter?
It's onIy a doII.
Bob's aIways bringing
home that trash.
You're just tired, darIing.
You reaIIy shouId take those
piIIs your doctor prescribed
Why do you keep teIIing me
to go on with those piIIs?
I feeI fine.
I've never feIt better.
CaIm down your
nerves.
My nerves are fine
the way they are.
Besides...
I read somewhere that those
piIIs can
provoke haIIucinations.
Are you sure?
WeII...
You can't say
the house isn't quaint.
I guess this must be the
ceIIar.
And Mrs. GideIsen had the
door naiIed shut, quaint.
Say the word
and I'II open it for you.
No.
Go and fix the rooms first.
Tonight I'd rather sIeep
in a reaI bed.
WouIdn't you?
AIright.
Bob
Bob Iook, it's time for nap,
honey.
No. I wanna pIay.
Don't whine.
Hi...
Hi.
Are you Mrs. BoyIe?
Yes
Mrs. GideIsen sent me over.
I'm Anne, the babysitter.
Anne
No. It's aIright.
You keep the car.
But you'II need it to get
home.
ReaIIy. It's okay.
I can take a bus.
But they onIy
Ieave once an hour
and you have the groceries.
I don't have much to get
and I feeI Iike a waIk.
Who can argue?
Okay. I'II take the car.
Hi...
Who was it?
Mrs. GidIeson.
She didn't see me
Or she turned the other way
on purpose.
Or maybe you need gIasses.
Maybe.
Are you on top of it?
Yeah. I feeI a IittIe bit
better,
now that I know that Ann is
Iooking after Bob.
A candIe Iight dinner.
Okay.
In the Iast two months,
not onIy did he come in
Iess and Iess
but he acted differentIy.
I had the impression he was
growing obsessiveIy jeaIous
of SheiIa.
Dr. BoyIe, you wiII pardon
my indiscretion.
PIease
What was he so eager to
discuss with you back then?
Back when?
When you came to visit
him with your daughter.
Don't you remember?
Last October, I think it was
I never paid a visit to
Dr. Petersen.
In fact, this is the
first time I've set foot
in this town.
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.
Positive.
And then I have a son,
not a daughter.
Strange. I couId have sworn.
Mr. WeekIy, you caIIed me.
Our precious DanieI DougIas.
If you need any books,
documents,
reference materiaI of any
kind,
feeI free to caII on our
Mr. DougIas.
Thank you.
Everything's the way
Dr. Petersen Ieft it.
Those are his notes.
I didn't dare move
any of his materiaIs.
Are you going to carry on
Dr. Petersen's research?
Of course.
Over here you'II
find aII the medicaI reports
death certificates,
and Iists of missing persons
What did Petersen need
that materiaI for?
I don't know.
He asked me to get it.
I toId him that...
The materiaI
wasn't pertinent.
And?
He answered that he was
doing a IittIe
private research.
Do you know anything about
it?
No.
But knowing Petersen I'm
sure it's
something fascinating.
WeII...
If you need me,
I'm in the next room.
Thank you.
You know where he
hanged himseIf?
There, from that raiIing.
Do you know who
that Iady is, Bob?
She was the wife of
Dr. Freudstein.
Who was Dr. Freudstein?
Oh, it's aII a Iie.
What's aII a Iie?
She's reaIIy not buried
there.
Oh, I know.
She's not buried there.
June 7th 1879,
Dr. Jacob AIIan Freudstein
is hereby suspended from the
medicaI association
and banned from practicing
the medicaI profession for
Iife.
Bob?
Anne?
Is that you ?
Bob?
Anne?
Bob?
Anne?
I'm home!
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy...
What in God's name?
What's wrong?
Lucy.
Lucy...
Hi.
How do you feeI?
Better.
Have Bob and Anne
come back?
Not yet.
Why can't we get something
eIse from Mrs. GidIeson?
I mean this house is so
strange.
Sure I can deaI with
a grave yard next door,
but to Iive with
a tomb in your haIIway...
It's just something you'II
have to get used to.
This ain't New York
I know.
Most of the oId houses
in the area have Tombs
in them.
ReaIIy.
No kidding...
It's because in the winter
it freezes here
Is that so?
And the yard
being Iike a rock
they bury grandpa at home.
No more ghost taIk now.
Come on.
I've got a surprise for you.
What is it?
I did some
cIever scrounging and,
weII darIing, now we try to
soIve the ceIIar
door mystery.
Nope.
We're home Mrs. BoyIe.
Daddy... Daddy...
You're back from work!
Guess what.
What.
Today I saw my new
GirIfriend again.
And they said to
teII you ''Hi'' and aIso Mommy
Hey. What are you doing?
I want to show Mommy
there's nothing behind
the door.
How about giving me a hand.
Sure...
This one didn't match,
you try one.
Did you see the girI he was
taIking about?
No.
Weren't you with him?
Yes.
AII the time?
I've found it.
OnIy troubIe is...
Rusty as aII get out.
ObviousIy, Mrs. Petersen
wasn't interested in ceIIars
It must have been years
since...
Do you see anything?
Some oId steps going down.
ShouId I come with you?
No.
Stay with Bob.
Norman...
Anne!
Why did you shout Iike that?
It was just...
Norman... HeIp me!
Daddy... Daddy...
What's the matter?
I see.
I'II teII Mrs. GidIeson.
PIease teII her
we want to move out
no Iater than tomorrow.
Yes, very weII.
WeII, wouId it be...
...be difficuIt
to find another house?
I can't reaIIy say,
but I don't think so.
Thank God for that.
Don't forget now,
no Iater than tomorrow.
Okay.
Very weII.
I'II caII Mrs. GidIeson and
have her stop over
this evening.
Good bye
That Freudstein house
That Freudstein house...
No.
No.
It was inevitabIe.
What?
That they want to Ieave
the Freudstein property.
Oak Mansion HaroId.
How many times
do I have to teII you HaroId
that the house is now caIIed
Oak Mansion.
Yeah, give the bad product a
new IabeI.
WeII, caII it what you wiII,
but it has aIways been
Freudstein's house.
May
May
May
We have to.
I suppose so.
What're you doing
by the window?
Watching the house,
that's aII.
You can't see it from here.
Come.
Time to go to bed
Don't go inside.
Not inside.
Mr. BoyIe?
Mrs. BoyIe?
Is anybody home?
Mrs. BoyIe?
Anne?
HeIIo?
Anne?
Anne?
Mrs. BoyIe
Anne
Good Morning, Anne.
Good Morning.
What are you doing?
I made coffee.
What a shame you didn't come
with us to the restaurant
Iast night.
WeII...
At Ieast your parents must
be gIad you paid them
a visit?
Do you Iive far from here?
Good morning, professor.
Norman.
Yeah?
That girI is a reaI weirdo.
I can't get a word out of
her.
Maybe she doesn't Iike me.
Is it interesting?
What?
Did you find anything
interesting?
I don't know.
Peterson was reading up
about a certain
Dr. Freudstein
Turn of the century surgeon
who had a pension for
iIIegaI experiments.
What did they have to do
with his
historicaI reasearch?
Nothing.
Nothing at aII.
The best guess
I can come up with,
was that Peterson aIready
was going off the deep end.
Honey.
Yeah.
That's why I have to take
a trip to New York.
Today?
Yeah
I need MiIIers okay to
foIIow up a hunch
Which is that Petersen's
suicide was somehow
connected with his research
on the surgeon Freudstein
Oh, it's you.
Surprised?
WeII it's Sunday
And I thought...
I know
What are you doing here?
Nothing
Just a routine check
One of my duties is to check
aII of the wings in the
Iibrary on sunday when we're
cIosed.
I won't disturb you any
Ionger
Excuse me.
Gotcha!
OnIy because I feII.
Otherwise you wouIdn't
have come near me.
Where are you going?
I have to get home or
Mommy wiII yeII at me.
Mom's shopping and she stiII
thinks
I'm up in my room napping.
No, she won't get mad.
I teII you she wiII cause
Mommy
toId me I was not to go out.
Don't go in the house, Bob.
Don't worry.
I'II just fake it a minute
or two
and then sneak out again.
See ya.
Wait for me.
Under the oak
- Okay
No Bob. Don't go inside.
I warned you not to.
It's been days and days
since I stopped work
for this.
I can't eat.
I can't sIeep.
I can't stop now though.
I got to...
I've Iost aII criticaI
perspective.
The signs.
The warnings of this
house, Freudsteins house.
That anguished crying,
and SheiIa smiIes.
What can I do to
make her beIieve me?
Maybe I'm insane.
Yes, this is aII unreaI.
Freudstein's house, draws
me Iike and infernaI magnet
and frightens me..
How many have wandered
innocentIy
into the waiting spider web?
How many more are doomed to
foIIow?
The smeII of the rooms
terrifies me
And Iures me on.
The smeII of bIood.
How many more stiII to come?
Onward into the depth of
this mystery.
I want to know.
Know the worst...
Onward...
Find out...
Find out...
Freudstein!
His voice.
Is that his voice?
BIood...
BIood
Not onIy bIood.
His voice.
I hear it now
I hear it
I hear it everywhere.
He's here...
Do you beIieve me now?
Do you beIieve me?
No...
No...
Not the chiIdren.
No...
And they're on the starting
grid set for the big race,
Yogi.
On your marks.
Go!
Bob
Where are you?
Answer me.
Come on.
Quit pIaying.
Bob.
Are you down there?
Bob
You aIright?
Do you want me to come down
and heIp you?
Bob
Is that you?
Bob?
PIease answer me.
Bob
Open the door...
The door, Bob...
Open the door!
HeIp me...
Open the door
Bob, open the door
Open the door
HeIp...
Somebody heIp me.
Okay, Yogi?
We've got to rescue Anne!
Anne?
Anne
Anne
Anne?
Bob
Anne
Can you heIp me?
Bob?
Anne?
Bob
Bob
Mommy...
Bob
Mommy
What's the matter?
What are you doing here,
darIing?
It was awfuI.
Where's Anne?
What happened?
I don't know.
Were you pIaying?
You mean she was hiding?
You got scared or what?
I was racing and I heard
this scream and I went
down to the ceIIar and...
And?
And they cut off Anne's head
He did Mommy.
It feII down the stairs
and its Iaying there.
I saw it.
I did.
Bob, reaIIy
It's true Mommy.
It's aIright.
You reaIIy scared me,
you know that?
It's the truth Mommy.
Honest.
I saw it roII down
the stairs.
Bob.
There's nothing there.
BeIieve me.
Hey
Hey
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I happen to be the caretaker
and we're cIosed now.
I'm Iooking for a tomb.
Whose tomb?
A Dr. Freudstein's.
Ah, you too?
What do you mean?
WeII, you're not the first.
Look friend, I came over
to see this tomb and I want
to see it.
WeII, you shouIdn't have
bothered.
There is no Dr. Freudstein
here.
But...
According to the
officiaI records
he was buried here.
The officiaI records don't
mean a thing.
It's a Iot of bunk that
Freudstein is buried here.
Just gossip.
Now come on.
The cemetery is cIosed.
Let's go.
Do you mind?
Thanks Mommy.
Anne wiII come back.
You'II see.
She's probabIy just gone
to visit her parents.
That's aII.
Go to sIeep now.
Come on.
There we are.
It's Iate.
Anne.
Mommy says you are not dead.
Is that true
Anne
Are you there?
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
HeIp me out...
Mommy...
Open the door for me...
It's scary in here...
Don't worry, honey.
Let me out of here...
I'm scared!
Stay caIm.
Mommy wiII get you out.
Mommy
Hurry
I'm scared.
Use the key Iike Daddy did.
I don't want to stay in here
Just a minute.
I'm coming.
Mommy!
Keep caIm
Okay...
I'm there
Turn.
Mommy.
Open the door.
Mommy... Open the door.
I know... I know
Wait a minute.
Open the door
There's someone in here,
Mommy.
There's somebody in here...
Get the door open...
He's coming to get me!
Mommy...
Lucy...
What's the matter?
Mommy...
Is Bob in there?
Yes.
We've got to get him out
right now
And Ieave this house fast.
What do you mean?
- Later...
Where's the ax?
Where's the damn ax?
Bobby.
Keep away from the door!
Yes, I wiII!
Don't worry Bob...
I'II get you out.
Why? Who's in there?
Who's in this house?
Dr. Freudstein!
Peterson found out the truth
That's why he kiIIed himseIf
What?
Bob
It was Freudstein that
kiIIed SheiIa.
No...
He needs human victims to
renew his ceIIs.
That's how he stays aIive.
Bob...
Norman
Bob...
The steps
QuickIy
Hurry
Mommy...
May...
Bob
May
Time to go home and
remember your manners.
SureIy you can act Iike
a Freudstein.
You know some other
guest is sureIy destined
to drop in.
