Five Three Zero Zero, Roger.
Standing by in the sky until
ground troops arrive.
Target Identified.
Releasing the Control Art Restriction
System to Level Three.
Please, come in.
You don't want another drink?
I want to get down on
my knees this instant...
and caress your legs
to admire all of your beauty.
But I lack the youth to do that.
I was very fortunate
to meet you at the party.
I knew you were the kind of person...
who could share my new
type of pleasure.
We don't need the illusion of light.
I can feel your beauty very well,
just like this.
You have a very nice scent.
Who's that?
Who's there?!
Situation C.
Keeping the power
restriction unlocked...
until the target has been silenced.
Who are you?!
Where do you think this is?!
The Royal Order of Religious Knights...
What did you say?!
Wait! Wait a minute!
Out of the way, human!
Unless you want to become
a shit-like ghoul!
Vam... pi... re...!
Limited Release Completed.
On June 12th this priest was
assigned to Cheddar Village.
One month later, people in the
village started to disappear.
The local police department
conducted the investigation.
They went to the church to arrest
him the day before yesterday.
However, all of them were killed.
The London Police Department
ordered D-11 to go into action.
Our elite D-11 unit sent
in one division...
but they lost half their men
in yesterday's action.
What's worse, the attackers were
identified as the local policemen...
who were presumed dead.
They're not human.
What?
The vampire sucked their blood.
He used them as food.
They became cannibalistic
monsters, ghouls.
I'm sure you've attended the lecture.
But to say they're not human...
Lieutenant, I don't have the right, nor
the intention to point out your mistake.
My mistake...?
What happened in Cheddar Village...
You, a lieutenant in the
London Police Department...
should have had the
knowledge to understand...
and determine what would be the
wisest way to handle the situation.
Yet it seems you intentionally forgot...
that there is only one way
to resolve this sort of thing.
You should have known
what the result would be...
even if you tried to take
care of it with your elite unit.
I haven't forgotten about
The Royal Order of Religious Knights...
the Hellsing Organization.
Night is falling...
Sir Integra Hellsing...
My organization has
already arrived in Cheddar.
How many divisions did you send?
One person.
One person?!
A great night...
The kind of night that makes
me want to drink blood.
Seras...
Jack, please don't try to talk!
Reinforcements will be arriving soon!
I wasn't expecting anything like this!
I don't like this.
I wanted to be strong...
so you and everyone else
would stop calling me little kitty.
I swore I would never cry
at a crime scene.
Jack!!
Jack!!
Jack! Stop!
That's enough!
Everybody's coming back...
Dead?!
They're all dead!
Andy... Eugene... hey!
It's me! Little kitty!
Can't you tell?
I am on my way to Cheddar now.
The hunter I sent is perfectly
suited to this type of situation.
You can leave everything
in our capable hands.
I didn't...
I didn't join D-11 to do this.
They're not human.
Not human...
Huh?!
It's a great night.
Isn't it, police girl?
This is the kind of night that makes
me feel like sucking blood.
You're not... human!
So, you shoot because I'm not human?
What am I doing?
Where am I trying to
escape to in this place?
The church always opens its doors
to people in distress.
Father...
You are still a young lady.
So fresh and full of life.
But the undead from
hell have frightened you.
Poor girl!
Are you... the priest?
I'm merely a person who
gives guidance to the weak.
I am on a mission...
and the most likely
suspect would be...
But you're normal.
You're referring to those ghouls
you encountered outside.
Ghouls?
Their blood was food
for the vampire.
They are just animated corpses,
who exist only to serve vampires.
Vampire?
That's right.
Vampires don't embrace every human.
For example...
Let me go.
I would never make you a ghoul.
Coursing through your body is
warm blood that's unbelievably sweet.
You... I'll shoot you.
I'll blow your brains out,
then tell everyone...
I know you're feeling pain...
but I will give you pleasure
that lasts forever.
That's enough!
Punk!
Who are you?!
My name is Arucard.
I'm merely a tool of the
special operations agency, Hellsing.
I dispose of garbage.
Garbage? Hah!
Special operations agency?!
Have you lost your mind?
No, you're the maggot
underneath the garbage!
Look at you!
That cheap outfit
isn't even fit for a carnival.
What do you think you're doing?
Wearing a priest outfit, you don't
even know the meaning of shame.
That's what makes you trash!
You can die now!
Commander...
You're a narrow-minded king...
who creates a host
of ghouls to keep as slaves.
You're a coward incapable
of acting on your own.
Even Hell wouldn't accept you!
Kill him!
He was all talk!
What?!
It can't be!
Guns are useless against me!
You're a...?
Ordinary guns that is...
Damn ghouls! Kill him already!
He's not human...
Why?!
Why are you...?!
We're both vampires!
You instant vampires are cockroaches!
Multiplying everywhere
before you know it.
I can't stand your kind...
half-ass vampire without the
slightest bit of self-respect!
You don't even know what you are!
By the way...
I have my reasons for serving humans.
But of course, it's not
a story for trash like you.
A silver-cross from the
Great Lanchester Church...
was melted down to cast...
the 13mm explosive rounds in this gun.
So relax. And go to Hell, forever!
She's the only surviving human.
I know you can't shoot her.
You're a servant of the humans.
Say, aren't we both vampires?
Humans are just lower creatures.
Inferior to us in every way.
Yes...
you should help me escape.
Come with me! If we work together...
Police girl.
Yes...
Listen to me! Are you listening to me?!
I'm going to shoot you in the lung...
the bullet will pass through you to hit
that trash vampire in the heart!
W... wait a minute!
You don't want to die now?
Do you want to come with me?
Look, you...
I won't force you. The choice is yours.
Answer!
Yes.
Arucard...
You chose this, police girl.
One normally closes one's eyes.
Mission completed.
All target activity has ceased.
The limited power release is completed.
You spent too much time
for just one target.
I'll call for rescue.
No.
I want you to transfer this police girl
to the Hellsing Organization.
You don't make decisions.
This police girl made
the choice for herself.
It's time for the Hellsing Organization
to withdraw.
Excuse me...
This was a great night...
wasn't it?
