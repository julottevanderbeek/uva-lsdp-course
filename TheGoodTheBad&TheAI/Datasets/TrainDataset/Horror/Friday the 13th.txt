l was wondering what day?
He's home from college.
How long were those
potatoes under the fire?
How did you do that?
# Hang down your head,
Tom Dooley #
# Hang down your head and cry #
# Hang down your head,

Somebody will see.
Come with me.
Does Mary Ann kiss as good as l do?
How would l know?
Oh, you!
You said we were special.
l meant everything.
Ohh.
Ohh.
Oh, Gary.
No.
Gary.
Come on.
No.
Come on.
Oh.
Somebody's there.
We weren't doing anything.
We were just mess--
Aah!
Please stop.
Stop.
No!
Help!
Aah!
Hi, girl.
Excuse me.
Hi, boy.
Hey, you speak English?
How far is it
to Camp Crystal Lake?
That far, huh?
Okey-dokey.
See you later.
Ugh!
It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.
This is Big Dave.
It's time for you lazy bones
to get out of bed.
It's black cat day
in Crystal Lake.
l must've cleaned
that tow jack 82 times.
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake?
# Your heart... ##
What is it, Enos?
About 20 miles?
About that.
Camp Blood.
They're opening that place again?
Lots of luck.
Can l get a bus or something?
Not likely.
You going down
to the crossroads, Enos?
What about a lift?
That'll be halfway.
No sweat, Trudy.
O.K., kid, let's move it.
Name's Annie.
All right, Annie.
Let's go.
All the girls up there
going to look as good as you?
l don't know.
You're going to Camp Blood,
ain't ya?
Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here.
Get.
Leave people alone!
You'll never come back again.
Oh, shut up, Ralph.
It's got a death curse!
He's a real prophet of doom,
ain't he?
Climb up, miss.
l tell you,
he's causing problems enough
for your boss
with all that talk.
Goddamn nuisance.
He tell you anything?
Who?
Your boss...
Steve Christy.
I'll be cooking
for 50 kids and 10 staff.
The campers will mostly be,
like, inner city children.
No, l mean about what happened.
No.
Come on.
There's something
you're not telling me.
Quit.
Quit now.
Quit?
Why would l want to quit?
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed.
Oh, terrific.
Not you, too?
You sound like your
crazy friend back there-- Ralph.
Maybe.
Did Christy tell you
about two kids murdered in '58?
Boy drowning in '57?
Bunch of fires.
Nobody knows who did any of them.
In 1962 they was going to open up.
The water was bad.
Christy will wind up
like his folks--
crazy and broke.
He's been up there a year
fixing up that place.
He must've dropped $25,000.
And for what?
Ask anybody.
Quit.
l can't.
Dumb kids.
Know-it-alls.
Just like my nieces.
Heads full of rocks.
You're an American original.
I'm an American original.
Dumb kid.
At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.
Take care of yourself, kid.
No sweat.
Thanks a lot for the lift.
Hey, uh, Marcie.
What?
You really think there'll be
other gorgeous women
at Camp Crystal Lake
besides yourself?
Sex all you ever think about?
No, no.
Absolutely not.
Ha!
Sometimes l just think
about kissing women.
Ahh!
Oh!
Ahh.
Ahh!
Hey, want to give me
a hand over here?
Sure.
Sure.
Alice!
l want to get
this tree stump out.
Get on this side.
On three, O.K.? Alice!
Coming.
That's great. That's great.
I'm Steve Christy.
Jack Burrel.
Marcie Cunningham,
Ned Rubinstein.
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.
Hi. Steve,
cabin B's all ready.
Is Bill finished
cleaning the boathouse?
l haven't seen him
for half an hour.
l want him to start painting.
What about Brenda?
You told her to set up archery.
I'd rather she paint.
l thought we had two weeks.
I'll show you where
you can get changed.
You have your clothes with you?
Back here.
Here. Let me give you
a hand with that.
Thank you.
You got it?
Mm-hmm.
You draw very well.
Thanks. l wish l had
more time to do it.
Aah.
When did you do this?
Last night.
Do l really look like that?
You did last night.
You're very talented.
And very pretty.
Thank you.
This really isn't
your cup of tea, is it?
Any particular reason?
It's just a problem l have.
It's nothing personal.
You want to leave?
l may have to go
back to California
to straighten something out.
Come on.
Give me another chance.
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.
All right. Friday.
I'll give it a week.
Thanks, Alice.
Bill, Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.
The paint's all right.
We'll need more thinner.
O.K. I'll tell him.
The others show up?
Yeah, everybody except that girl
who's supposed to handle
the kitchen-- Annie.
Think you'll last all summer?
l don't know if I'll last all week.
I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
Fine.
Do you want it listed separately?
That's right.
After lunch, Brenda,
finish the archery range.
lf Annie gets here,
get her started in the kitchen.
Do your best, all right?
I'll be back sometime after lunch.
Supposed to rain like hell.
Get as much done as possible.
l don't want to get too far behind.
See you.
Bye-bye.
He neglected to mention
that downtown
they call this place Camp Blood.
Next you'll say there are
poisonous snakes in the outhouse
and crocodiles in the lake.
No, the crocodiles
are in the cabins.
Ta-da!
Are you crazy?
Want to see my trick shot?
It's even better.
l don't believe you!
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.
Yeah?
Did you come to help me
or scare me to death?
Do that again,
I'll tack you on the wall.
l love that sexy talk!
Hi.
I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.
l guess l always wanted
to work with children.
l hate when people call them kids.
Sounds like little goats.
But when you've had a dream
as long as l have,
you'll do anything.
Wasn't that the road
for Camp Crystal Lake back there?
Uh, l think we better stop.
Please?
Stop, please?
Please, stop!
Please, stop!
Oh!
Ow.
Ow!
Ow.
No.
No.
No.
Little to the left.
No, no, no, no.
O.K., baby, slow it down.
Let's go.
O.K. Good, good, good.
lf you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?
Rocky Road.
Hey!
What's that vitamin ''C'' stuff
do for you anyway?
Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.
What's the matter?
Do you see something?
No, nothing.
Oh!
Ned!
Get out of here!
Ned!
Aah!
I'm getting to you.
Very slowly.
Ha ha! You!
Hey, you guys.
You ready to go back to work?
Yeah.
Ohh.
Come on, Alice.
Help!
Help! Help!
Something's wrong with Ned.
Get a life preserver!
Is it far?
Can he swim?
He's right around here somewhere.
Go ahead.
Dive for him.
There he is.
Come on, you guys.
Help us.
Watch his head.
Here.
Grab hold of that.
O.K.
Move it away.
Watch his head.
Got him?
Yeah.
Do you give mouth-to-mouth?
Yeah.
Pull up his head.
Oh, God.
Come on, Neddie.
Come on.
Oh, Neddie!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Aah!
Bill!
Bill!
Come here quick!
Hurry!
What is it?
There's a snake over there.
Where?
What do l do?
Kill it.
It might bite.
Haven't you ever been in the woods?
We're not in the woods.
Jesus, Bill, what are you doing?
There's a snake in here.
Then why are we in here?
Feet, don't fail me now.
There it is!
Ahh!
l can't sleep with a snake in here.
Nobody told us anything
about snakes.
Kill it.
You heard the lady.
l can't get it till it comes out.
Call him.
How do you call a snake?
I'll flush it out!
No!
- Aah!
- Aah!
l got it!
Where?
l got it!
Kill it!
Is it dead?
Either that or it's got
a very short clone.
Oh, God.
Well, at least we know
what's for dinner.
- Oh!
- Oh, Marcie!
- Gross!
l make good salad.
Want me to make bread pudding?
Great.
We've got hamburger.
None for me, thank you.
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?
Oh, sure.
No sweat.
Oh, what is going on?
Oh, shit.
All right, who are you people?
Camp counselors.
Neddie's just fooling around.
Right, I'm just--
Can it, Cochise.
Steve Christy hire you people?
He pay you for this?
Nice bike.
See if you're smoking, boy.
Don't smoke.
Causes cancer.
You just get off a spaceship?
Colombian gold, man, grass,
hash, the weed. Dig it?
Hey, what's he talking about?
Hey, don't get smart.
Me? I'm dumb as they come.
Not another word
out of you, understand?
Really.
Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.
In shape for what?
Officer, can we help?
Looking for somebody.
Who's that?
A guy named Ralph.
Town crazy.
No crazy people around here.
l told you to sit on it, Tonto.
l got word that Ralph
was pedaling out this way
spouting his gospel.
We haven't seen anybody here,
Officer.
Just us.
This Ralph, is he dangerous?
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.
l spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.
Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.
This is Dorf at Camp Crystal Lake.
Over.
Haul it back in.
Chief wants you back on the double.
Roger that. 10-4.
On my way. Out.
Never keep the chief waiting.
You kids keep your noses clean.
Understand?
You'll be hearing
from me if you don't.
We ain't going to stand
for no weirdness out here.
Aah!
I'm the messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.
This place is cursed.
Cursed.
It's got a death curse.
Who are you?
What do you want?
God sent me.
Get out of here, man.
l got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.
Go.
Go!
l think we just met Ralph.
God, what's next?
You're doomed.
You're all doomed.
Who likes them rare?
Me.
How can you guys eat that stuff?
It looks like dead animals.
Dead animals?
That's the old counselors.
You cannibal.
lf you'd mix right,
you'd get all your protein.
Too bad Annie never showed up.
She was supposed to be a good cook.
Don't expect me to replace her.
Trouble?
Bad bulb or no power.
It seems a little gloomy in here.
Steve taught me how to use
the emergency generator.
Town power lines are real lousy.
Don't you love that macho talk?
The emergency generator.
Let's go.
I'll take care of these.
Will you watch the burgers?
Burn them.
Want cheese?
Yeah, uh-huh.
You really think
you can get this to work?
l don't know.
Hey, this looks like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Well, here goes.
What an antique.
O.K.
What hath God wrought?
Hello?
Can l help you?
Hello?
Hello?
Come on.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Man.
Ooh, wind's come up.
It shifted a good 180 degrees.
Need someone to hold on to.
What about Ned?
l don't love Ned.
He keeps acting like such a jerk.
Neddie!
Don't call him.
l thought you wanted to give him
one of your motherly lectures.
Neddie's going to do
whatever Neddie wants to.
Ooh, it's going to storm.
It'll tear down that valley
like a son of a gun.
I've feared storms
since l was little.
No. Really?
Yeah. I've had this dream
about five or six times
where I'm in a thunderstorm--
Mm-hmm.
and it's raining really hard.
It sounds like pebbles
when it hits the ground.
l can hear it.
l try to block out
the sound with my hands,
only it doesn't work.
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.
And then...
the rain turns to blood.
The blood washes away
in little rivers.
Then the sound stops.
It's just a dream.
Yeah, l know.
l call it my shower dream.
Hey, hey, this is no dream.
Come on.
We're going to get soaked.
Jack and Marcie are
going to get drenched.
Not if they're where
l think they are.
That's nice.
Mm-hmm.
Hey...
l know what we can do.
We're going to play Monopoly.
l hate Monopoly.
Not the way l play it.
We're going to play strip Monopoly.
You have got to be kidding.
What about if Steve walks in?
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on.
Everything else goes.
Instead of paying rent,
you pay clothes.
Bill can be banker,
unless, of course, he's chicken.
Heaven help you if you land
on one of my hotels.
See if Marcie left any grass.
What happened to my 500?
Right there.
Where's my shoe?
I'm not going to pass go
without a glow.
We already rolled for you.
You're going last.
Oh, and Community Chest
cannot give you your clothes back.
Double sixes.
l get to roll again.
l think we're being hustled.
l think you're right.
You are so fine.
Where you going?
l got to pee.
Hurry back, O.K.?
It's getting cold in here.
Save my place for me.
Oh, yeah.
Five.
''Baltic Avenue.''
I'll buy it.
No one ever lands
on Baltic Avenue.
It's a pretty color.
O.K.
Come on.
Ha! Eight!
doo doo doo.
Baltic Avenue.
You owe me one boot.
Coming.
Alice draws first blood.
That's a terrible way
to talk about my feet.
Thank you.
Who's next?
You know, l think I'm beginning
to like this game.
Just wait until he lands on
my old Kentucky home.
More beer?
More beer.
Let's see... the railroad.
''40 Yards To The Outhouse,
by Willie Makeit.''
Come on, kids.
You can do better than that.
Jack?
# Jack? ##
Jack?
When l looked into that mirror,
l knew I'd always be ugly.
l said, ''Lizzie,
you'll always be plain.''
Hello?
Aha!
Ned?
Hey, come on, you guys.
Allee allee in free!
Must be my imagination.
Aah!
Hello.
Worst run of bad luck
since Richard Nixon.
You can always call it quits.
Fat chance.
You're two steps from Pacific Avenue
and Skin City.
Well, what can l say?
It's not much, but l call it home.
Aah!
Oh, no!
I'll get it.
Get the money!
Oh, God!
It's crazy out there.
l think l left
my cabin windows open.
Shoot.
Well, we'll have to finish
this game some other night.
Just when it was
getting interesting.
See you guys in the morning.
See ya.
Night.
Night.
Ohh!
Look at this mess.
Were you really going
to go ahead with this?
Actually, l hadn't made up my mind.
We'll have to finish
the game another night.
Steve, is there
anything else you want?
No, no, thanks, Sandy.
I'm fine.
You can't go back out in that rain.
You wanna get drowned?
I've got to.
I've got six
new counselors at camp.
They are babes in the woods.
They'll be O.K. if they don't
have to come out in the rain.
What do l owe you?
Just a night on the town, Steve.
You know what l mean.
That's O.K.
Thank you.
Here's your change, Steve.
You keep it, Sandy.
Thank you.
Drive careful.
l will.
Good night.
Hi.
Hi, Steve.
That's supposed to go
through anything.
Not dragging a trailer.
Can you give me a lift?
A counselor will bring me back
in the morning.
Help me!
Help me!
Hello!
Hello!
Over here!
Please!
Somebody help me!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello?
Come quickly!
Please!
Come quickly!
Help!
Where are you?
Hello!
Hello!
All right!
Come on out!
It's not funny anymore!
It's not funny at all.
Aah!

Bill.
Hi.
Generator's O.K.
l thought l heard a scream.
l didn't hear anything
through that wind.
It sounded like Brenda.
l better take a look.
And somebody turned on
the lights at the archery range.
l can't see anything.
They're off now.
I'm going to check it out.
Bill?
Can l come?
Come on then.
Brenda!
Brenda!
Where is she?
She must be with Jack and Marcie.
Alice?
Yeah?
What is going on?
Come on!
Jack!
Jack, open the door!
Where are they?
l don't know.
Come on.
Brenda.
Marcie?
Hey, guys.
Jack.
Neddie?
Bill, l think
we should call someone.
lf this is a joke,
I'm gonna brain 'em.
I'm serious.
l really think
we should call someone.
Sucker's locked.
Where's the key?
l don't know.
Wait a minute.
Watch out.
Careful.
Let me get the light.
What's wrong?
It's dead.
Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime or a quarter?
Hello?
Oh, this damn thing's dead, too.
What's the matter with it?
It's wet.
l don't know.
Why don't we just
hike out of here right now?
It's 10 miles
to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.
We can use his Jeep.
Don't worry. Probably some
stupid explanation for all this.
Like what?
We'll be laughing
about this tomorrow.
l promise.
Let's get out of this rain.
It's not bad enough
to have Friday the 13th,
but to have a full moon, too.
We keep statistics.
We have more accidents, more rapes,
more robberies, more homicides,
more of everything
with a full moon.
It upsets people.
Makes 'em nuts.
You're making science
out of coincidence.
Hear ol' Ralph
was out your way today.
His wife was a nervous wreck
till we got him home.
That's all l need--
crazy Ralph running around.
Well, the rain's stopping.
It was a pisser while it lasted.
Sergeant Tierney, come in.
Sergeant Tierney, car niner.
This is Tierney.
Rescue squad with jaws of life.
Near mile marker 17.
Possible fatal.
Three, maybe more trapped.
Head-on.
Roger.
Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival 15 minutes.
Let you off here, Steve.
Sure.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Hello?
Who is that?
Oh, hi.
What are you doing
out in this mess?
What do you think happened?
l don't know.
Generator's probably out of gas.
I'll go check it.
Do you want me to come with you?
Why don't you stay here
and try and get some sleep.
I'll be right back.
Gas.
Bill!
Bill?
Generator.
Bill!
Bill!
Bill!
Bill!
Bill?
Bill.
Bill?
Bill?
Bill!
Aah!
Bill!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Aah!
What am l gonna do?
Brenda!
God!
Oh, my God.
Steve! Oh, Steve!
Who are you?
Well, I'm Mrs. Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christies.
Oh, thank God you're here.
It's been such a nightmare!
l can't help you
if you don't calm down.
She's dead and he's dead...
Oh, my God, poor Bill!
All right.
Come on, dear, then show me.
No.
But it's all right.
I'll take care of you.
l used to work for the Christies.
What's going on here?
It's just this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.
No! They're all dead!
They're all dead!
All right.
I'll go look.
Please don't leave me.
They'll kill you, too.
I'm not afraid.
Oh, my Lord.
So young.
So pretty.
What monster could've done this?
Bill's out there.
Oh, God.
This place!
Steve should never have
opened this place again.
There's been too much trouble here.
Did you know that
a young boy drowned
the year before those
two others were killed?
The counselors weren't
paying any attention.
They were making love while
that young boy drowned.
His name was Jason.
l was working
the day that it happened,
preparing meals here.
l was the cook.
Jason should've been watched!
Every minute!
He was--
He wasn't
a very good swimmer.
We can go now... dear.
l think we should wait
for Mr. Christy.
Oh, that's not necessary.
l don't understand.
Help me!
Help!
Help, Mommy!
Help!
Help, Mommy!
Mommy, help!
l am, Jason.
l am.
Help!
Oh, God.
You see, Jason was my son,
and today is his birthday.
Where's Mr. Christy?
Oh, l couldn't let them
open this place again.
Could l?
Not after what happened.
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.
My only child...
Jason.
You let him drown.
You never paid any attention.
Look at what you did to him.
Look what you did to him!
Aah!
Ohh...
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her!
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live.
l won't, Jason.
l won't.
Come, dear.
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.
Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Ahhh!
Uhhh!
Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her.
She can't hide.
No place to hide.
Get her, Mommy.
Get her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Kill her.
Aah!
Aah!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No!
No!
It's all right now.
It's over.
Everything's over.
Roll over.
O.K.
Your folks are on the way up.
Is anyone else alive?
Are they all dead?
Yes, ma'am.
Two of my men pulled you
out of the lake.
We thought you were dead, too.
Do you remember very much?
The boy.
Is he dead, too?
Who?
The boy.
Jason.
Jason?
In the lake.
The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me
underneath the water.
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.
But he...
Then he's still there.
