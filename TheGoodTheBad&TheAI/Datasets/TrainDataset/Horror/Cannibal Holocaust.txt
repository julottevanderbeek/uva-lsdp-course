Help him!
Hold it!
Look what's hanging here -
a lighter.
Poor Oliveira...
Only 20 years old.
Once it hits the bloodstream,
there's nothing you can do.
Better a bullet than a dart
tipped with curare.
But we gave him the serum
right away.
Sure, the serum.
It only works half the time,
if it isn't already too old
by the time we get it.
They'd just love to blow his
head off because of Oliveira.
So would I.
But we're expecting that Yankee,
and we have orders
to assist him.
He's in luck -
a Yacùmo prisoner is like a
passport into the Green Inferno.
It's full of shit, clean it!
