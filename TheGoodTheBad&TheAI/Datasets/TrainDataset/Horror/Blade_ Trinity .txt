What's this chicken scratch?
It's cuneiform.
It's about 4,000 years old.
So why here?
Because this is the cradle of civilization.
He would've been comfortable here.
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.
There's something beneath us.
You find a watch?
Is it a body?
Guys?
Aah!
Go! Aah!
What the fuck?!
Aah!
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist
and author of the
bestseller
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,
next on
Okay, Dr. Vance.
You are a psychiatrist
and a biochemist. Isn't that true?
Yes, Bently. I am both.
And it's for a reason.
I have always believed
that true health can only be achieved
if we reconcile
the body and the mind.
And of course,
in order to do that,
we have to get rid
of a lot of old notions.
Okay. And... how's that
fit in with vampires?
In the case of vampires,
we're dealing with creatures that, uh,
are the repositories of some
of our most taboo thoughts.
- Okay.
- Predatory rage.
- Yeah.
- Sexual sadism.
- Sexual?
- Sexual sadism.
These are very scary subjects
for people to own up to,
and they're right inside.
So what you're saying is
we pass the buck onto someone else.
- You bet we do.
- And vampires...?
Well, for instance,
there's a hereditary blood disease.
I talk about it in my book.
It's called porphyria.
And the symptoms of this disease
are remarkably similar
to classic vampire traits.
The people who suffer
from this disease are anemic,
they become intolerant to sunlight,
they can't handle garlic...
Garlic?
Chief Vreede. Okay.
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?
Vampires, vampires. What?
The only vampires I'm worried about
are the ones passing the bar exam.
Seriously, though.
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?
The truth is our streets
have never been safer.
Homicide, assaults, violent crime
is down across the board.
If people want to be concerned,
they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.
Blade is a troubled individual.
I understand that he is
under the impression
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings
of a belief like that.
Odds are he believes
that he is out there slaying monsters.
- But what he's really doing...
- Mm-hmm.
...is trying to kill
aspects of himself.
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!
Aah!
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.
Got it. Heading westbound.
I'm just beneath ya.
Go!
Aah!
Aah!
Come on!
I got him. Pull!
You all right, man?
He's got a gun!
Oh, my God!
Ouch.
Staked you with silver.
Why aren't you ash?
Why aren't you smarter?
Not a vampire, dumb shit!
Set your sorry ass up.
Damn.
Oh, Blade.
What the fuck happen tonight?
How should I know?
He was human.
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.
Killing vampires is clean.
They ash... don't leave
any evidence behind.
Killing humans is messy.
You better hope nobody ID'd you.
This worked really good.
What's this?
A new delivery system for your serum.
It's an effervescent inhaler.
Just bite down on the mouth guard.
Delivery's automatic.
Some friends of mine made it.
Friends?
Yeah.
You remember those?
-
-
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.
It's time to take these cowboys down.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
What's he been doing?
Fuck all. Just feeding.
Been through five of them so far.
Do you think we have enough security?
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.
You understand?
I'm gonna go in.
You shouldn't have woken me.
We had to.
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.
What makes you think I care?
Your people need you.
My people?
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.
Look how far you have fallen.
The world's changed since your time.
The humans have a new hunter.
Blade.
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?
Yes.
Subject is heading west.
Got him.
Congratulations.
You're famous.
Somebody nailed us.
Your face is all over the papers
and television.
Media's eatin' it up.
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.
Something like this...
taking out a human...
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,
you're public enemy number one.
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. Campaign.
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.
You worry too much, old man.
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.
You're like a son to me.
I'm sorry I got old on ya.
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.
And it breaks my heart.
We can't win this war alone.
Look, he just gave me the evil eye.
Come on, man.
What about that guy?!
Bro and prostitute, baby.
So what?
Quit fucking around.
I'm hungry,
and I want to eat somebody.
How about him?
No fatties.
They taste like Cheetos.
No, I like him.
Wait... what about that?
Shrunken apple-headed bitch.
They fucking saw us over there.
Fucking blow me, man!
Just pick one already. Jesus Christ!
Oh, got it! Got it!
Baby on board.
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!
Oh, yeah, baby!
What's for dinner?
Aah!
Hey, pretty lady.
No! No!
No!
Scream if this hurts, chica.
Aah!
Fuck you?
Aah!
Garlic!
Scream if  hurts, chica.
Aah!
What is it?
What you were worried about.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Aah!
Move a finger and you're dead.
How's about this one?
He's got something in his hand!
Get out, Blade!
Shit!
What's going on in there?
Somebody talk to me!
Aah!
Hold it right there!
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.
Whistler.
Dead.
Just like all your victims.
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?
But they were all familiars.
People who work with them.
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?
Say, so how do you kill
these bloodsuckers, tough guy?
Maybe you could give us a few pointers.
You can stake 'em, right?
What about sunlight? I mean,
they ain't feelin' sunlight, right?
What about crosses?
Do they still work, Wilson,
in this day and age?
I don't know, Ray. I mean, what if
mister homey vampire is, like, Jewish?
That's a good point.
What about garlic?
Does that work on Hindu vampires?
Or do you need, like, saffron
or some shit?
- That was quick.
- Thank you.
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.
It's not gonna play.
We know what you are.
You're a stone-cold killer.
And you're sick as fuck.
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.
Hello, Blade.
My name is Dr. Vance.
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?
He's all yours.
I know you must find this
very frightening...
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.
And in order for me to do that,
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?
You know, Blade...
the darndest thing.
I was signing in at security,
and, uh, couldn't remember the date.
Do you know what day it is?
How about the President?
You know who  is.
Who's in the White House right now?
An asshole.
I think somebody here
wants to talk about vampires.
Vampires.
For everyone else,
it's kind of silly.
I had a set of wax teeth
when I was seven years old.
It was fun.
I could be somebody else.
But I want to hear
talk about vampires.
What can you tell me about them?
They exist.
Are you one of them?
Sometimes...
the scariest monster of all...
...is the one in the mirror.
Tell me about blood.
When you drink blood,
do you ever feel sexually aroused?
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.
Nuzzling into someone's neck.
A nocturnal visit.
It promises a...
delicious physical intimacy.
The very sweet taste of saliva...
mixed with skin.
Sounds good to
Where's it come from?
That's what I wanna know.
And I'm starting to wonder what your
relationship with your mother was like.
Were the two of you very close?
He's psychotic.
No shit.
For his safety and for the public's,
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric...
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.
Don't fuck with my thing!
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.
Not this time.
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?
There.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Ooh, you're weak.
In need of your serum.
That must be a bad feeling.
I mean, who would've imagined
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.
You're one of them.
A familiar.
Going on five years now.
It's the endgame, Blade.
All their plans are coming to fruition.
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?
I hate familiars.
Hi, Blade.
So glad to finally meet you.
I am such a fan.
I like your tattoos.
Do they mean anything?
Stupid.
Are you okay?
Are you tired?
You're weak.
We moved the humans around.
Like pawns.
We used them...
...to flush you out.
You're not so big.
You're all alone, Blade.
No one's gonna help you now.
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.
Go!
Freeze!
Whistler!
This way!
Blade!
You're dead!
Get down!
Blade.
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
Where the fuck is he going?
This is supposed to be a rescue!
Get back, get back!
We're pinned down.
I can't shoot around corners.
can.
Aah!
Okay. We're fucked.
We're fine.
Forgot my sword.
Whoo! Come on!
Abby.
Aah!
We got him.
We'll be there soon.
Who the hell are you people?
Well, my name is Hannibal King.
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.
Whistler's daughter.
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,
and I told him I wanted in.
Been doing it ever since.
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.
How do you bankroll this operation?
I date a lot of older men.
Come on, man, I'm joking.
You met Dex.
This is Hedges.
Sommerfield... she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.
How many of you are there?
There's enough.
We operate in sleeper cells.
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.
Consider us your reinforcements.
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?
You?
Look at you.
You're kids.
You're not ready to roll with this.
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.
What, that's supposed to be tactical?
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."
It's a joke, huh?
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?
You think this is a fucking sitcom?
Okay, first off, that's just rude.
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.
I'm impressed.
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.
Like it or not, we are all you got.
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?
Well, here's for starters.
I used to be one.
Do I pass the audition?
Rookies.
Fucking Hannibal King!
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!
Ugh!
Ugh!
We had Blade.
We had him!
Ugh!
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?
Blow me.
We got caught with our pants down.
Pants down?
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.
Oh, you loved it.
Has he been told?
About your failure?
Yes.
Maybe it's time I joined the game.
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,
but you still manage to ask
for her number.
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.
But  betty...
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.
Her name is Danica Talos.
You met her earlier.
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.
Moving on.
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.
I picked Danica up in a bar
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck
as her little vampire cabana boy.
Eventually, Abigail found me.
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.
We need to pool our resources, Blade.
"We"?
Yeah, we.
He's come back.
Take a look at this.
You gotta be kidding me.
Where'd you guys
get this stuff?
I stole most of it.
Danica had a huge collection.
You got stonework, ironwork,
weaponry, art.
It's this stuff that shows up everywhere.
This symbol, this glyph...
It's on everything in here.
He is real.
You dig beneath all the... the myths,
all the layers of bullshit that have cluttered
our culture for the last 500 years,
and eventually
you're gonna strike the truth.
So the movies are true.
The movies are just a comforting
fairy tale compared to the real deal.
Bram Stoker... he wrote a good yarn,
but the events that he described
back in 1897...
God. That was just a tiny piece
of the mosaic.
The real Dracula... his origins
date back much, much earlier than that.
How early?
Try six or seven thousand years.
This is a piece of his armor.
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.
Check this out.
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.
He was the first of his kind.
The patriarch of
He was born perfect.
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.
Forget the movies, forget the books.
There's no happy ending with this guy.
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...
...just like that...
...he up and disappeared.
And then we heard a rumor.
The vampires were searching for him.
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.
And he was pissed.
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal
In the window...
You sell vampire merchandise?
Uh, yeah.
Look around.
We might have a few things.
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.
Did you see those?
There's bobble heads, key chains.
This is funny.
We've got just about anything.
Even vampire vibrators.
Here. Check this out.
Dra-cola.
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?
Was there something special
you needed?
Hey, guy.
She's talkin' to ya.
What?
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?
Aah!
No!
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal
Aah!
Aah!
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal
Why wake up Drake now?
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.
When I was under the fang,
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.
I mean, that makes no sense, right?
They've always had plans
for the human race,
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,
Drake's return is part of it.
Let's face it.
We are fighting a losing battle here.
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year... big deal.
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.
We need a new tactic.
Like what?
A biological weapon.
For you sighted people...
...here's a little show and tell.
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.
We're calling it DayStar.
Think about it, Blade.
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.
So what's been holding you back?
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.
We need Dracula's blood.
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,
his DNA is still pure.
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.
All the vampires go bye-bye.
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?
Oh.
Holy shit.
Um, gentlemen and hottie,
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery
for your viewing pleasure today.
Electronic pistol... comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.
Explosive rounds.
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light
instead of your standard hollow points.
I call 'em sun dogs.
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.
This little pea shooter...
it's a modified version
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.
Pick your poison... sun dogs, stakes,
heat-seeking mini rockets.
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...
Oh, God.
Over here, we, um...
we call this the UV Arc.
Whoa. Sorry.
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser...
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones...
I have a... I have a question
about that, Hedges.
Have you ever been laid?
Many times.
With ladies.
Time for a little pressure.
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command
has always been their familiars.
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.
We bleed the wannabes...
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.
I got you some new wheels.
You take care of it now.
She's making playlists.
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all
Let me see you say ho
Let me see you say ho
Aah!
Ah! Aah!
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.
Who's your handler?
I don't know my fucking handler.
I swear. I swear!
Oh, shit! Please! Please!
Oh, it's
I'll take that.
Come on!
Let's go! Come on!
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.
It's for you.
Yeah, go ahead.
Hello?
Aah!
You know, at some point, you, uh,
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.
You know? Have a little share time?
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?
That sort of thing?
Also... just a thought... but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.
Hey.
You just can't walk in here like... aah!
Excuse me, sir.
Don't do that.
Where's Vance?
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.
Sit.
Can I, uh, can I help you?
Remember me?
Time for payback.
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?
Oh, Jesus.
It's him.
Abby. It's Drake!
Aah!
So, you're the hunter they all fear.
I had a feeling about you.
Just shoot him!
Go ahead, Blade.
Show me what you're made of.
Aah!
