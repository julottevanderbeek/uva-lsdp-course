'Hi, you've reached the new residence
'of George Cooper
and Lauren Daniels.
'We'll spare you the agony
of a cute, little message.
'However, if you'd like
to leave one, wait for the beep.'
George, this is Derek.
Hi, Derek.
'Look, George, I know you're there.
You're just not answering the phone.'
You're smart, Derek.
'George, this is really important
so I'm asking you as a personal favor,
'please, just pick up the phone
and talk to me, okay?'
Okay, Derek.
- 'All right, George, listen.'
- All right, Derek.
'Our deadline on the follow-up
article this Friday. That's tomorrow.
'I can't write a word
until you give me the pictures.
'Have you found the bag lady yet?
Have you found her brother?
'George, I can't afford
to miss this deadline.
'It's not just the money,
it's my credibility.
'I mean, these guys
are not holding their breath,
'waiting for a story
about a bunch of subterranean bums.
'Give me any pictures. I don't care
what they are. What do you say?'
All right, Derek,
you made your point.
Hey, George?
- Yes?
- Who was that?
Uh, that was a wrong number.
Wrong number left a message?
You'd better start getting ready.
Ready for what?
For what?
We have a photo session.
What photo session?
Wait a minute. You are talking about
a photo session that I have today?
This is today we're talking about, with
the client, Tony and everybody there?
- What are you doing?
- I have a pimple.
Why are you putting makeup
on your ass?
'Cause it's where the pimple is.
And what are we shooting,
a centerfold?
It's a perfume ad, remember?
And what are you wearing
in this perfume ad?
- Perfume.
- Whoa! That's it?
- That's all you're wearing?
-  Yeah.
Great.
I don't ever remember agreeing to this.
You know what I'm saying?
This is some more
of that plastic fashion crap
that I told you
I didn't want to do anymore?
Was I drunk?
Were we making love?
Come on,
let's forget about this
and stay here and,
you know, make stuff up.
It's at 10:00.
Alderson Studios.
We're booked. You're shooting.
Come on, don't make me do this.
I've been up all night.
You know which box
my jewelry case is in?
It's still down in the basement.
Wait, wait. You brought up
all your camera stuff
and left my things in the basement?
My... My jewelry?
Don't you think
you better get it?
Hello?
Oh.
Hi, Derek, it's good
to hear your voice.
- Hi!
- Hi.
Are you the people
who are subletting Morton's studio?
- Yeah.
- Uh, to live in?
Yeah, we're improvising.
Well, if you need anything,
I'm Francine. This is Justin.
- I'm Lauren. Hi.
- You're a photographer, too?
I'm the model.
George is the photographer.
I gotta go.
I roped him into doing a fashion shoot.
Good luck.
Thanks!
Shit.
No, I can't use the outs
from the old...
That's not the point, Derek!
The point is I don't want to.
I want new photographs
for a new article.
And I can't find the people that
I got to take pictures of. They're...
I don't know where they are!
I don't know, Derek.
What do bums do on their day off?
That's funny.
Did you make that up?
Not... No.
Not today either.
I can't help you today.
I cannot do
anything today! Why?
Because today
I'm gonna shoot Lauren.
Okay? Goodbye!
Tuesday. Hey, boss.
This one's got your name on it.
Hays, get on the stolen car ring.
- What about the Kirby case?
- This is more important.
Than a potential homicide?
Kirby isn't a homicide,
he's a missing person.
I can't tie up the whole force
just because some guy decided
to walk out on his wife.
This is the fourth time the guy's walked
out on his wife in the last two weeks.
- What'd you turn up on the others?
- Nothing, but...
Right, nothing.
So they're filed under missing persons.
Now, if they turn up
great, fine. I'm delighted.
But I can't waste
any more time on this.
- But, Captain, you're not...
- Hays, look.
I don't wanna bore you
with crime statistics,
but, uh, between you and me,
they're not going down.
Now, file Kirby under missing persons
and get on with it.
Yes, sir.
Uh, Chief O'Brien, please.
This is Captain Bosch.
All right, I'll take it.
- O'Brien.
- Chief, this is Bosch.
Look, I can't keep a lid
on this any longer.
- You've got to.
- You don't understand, I can't.
- 'No.'
- Chief!
- It's not my decision.
- I know that, but...
Well, if you know that, then you know
there's nothing I can do about it.
You've got your orders, Bosch,
now carry them out.
-
-
- Sanderson?
- Yes, sir.
Sanderson, uh...
Run down the blotter.
Give me everything we've got
in the vicinity
of Lafayette Street.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Bosch! What's happening?
Nothing for you today... Murph.
Nothing, huh?
You know, you cops will never learn.
I said nothing, Murphy.
That's a dead giveaway.
Now, I know something's wrong.
You see, if you guys are smart,
what you do is,
you palm me off
a little tidbit of information.
That way I'd never know
the difference.
Okay. I'll let you in on it.
I'm about to interrogate
a bag lady
we just nabbed
on the charge of petty theft.
Not bad...
Not bad, Bosch.
All right. What we got here?
She tried to lift my gun.
I nabbed her.
All by yourself?
This happened
at Lafayette and Houston?
- Yeah.
- What's her story?
Who knows? She won't talk.
- You let her make a phone call?
- Who, her?
She's entitled to one call.
Let her make it.
Terrific. Wonderful.
You look great.
You look like a million bucks.
You got a date later on tonight?
Give a smile, huh?
Hey, thank you. Come on.
Whoa, what style, what content!
Oh, what art! Oh, my God!
I love this profession!
Tony, give me two more stops
on that backlight.
Is this what it's gonna be all day?
All tits and ass,
ass and tits, sell some perfume.
Whose idea was this anyway?
What genius came up with this concept
to sell this perfume today?
You wanna blow this job for me?
What's the matter?
Am I making you nervous?
Yeah. This is my first chance
for national exposure.
- Well...
- You're making...
Very well put.
Are you upset
because I'm posing nude?
No, I'm not, Lauren.
Posing nude comes with the territory.
I'm upset because these people
are using your body
and draping it with the carcass
of some helpless, little field mouse
to sell some worthless perfume
which probably smells like sheep shit!
What are you shushing me for?
They know it! They made it!
They know what's in it
and what it takes to sell it!
Stop it!
I'm sorry, okay?
I forgot what all wondrous fun
this was for me.
It's a goof, it's a joke.
It doesn't matter.
You don't care about them.
You're doing this for me.
We're gonna bamboozle these guys
for big bucks and go home.
Okay?
Okay.
- Okay.
-  I'll be back.
'George, this is Derek.
'I am having
a nervous breakdown.
'I've gone ahead
and written the copy without you.
'When you give me the pictures,
I'll fudge it to fit them.'
'Lauren Daniels,
this is Dr. Bremner's office.
- 'Please call when you get a chance.'
-
'Cooper, you son of a bitch! I'm in jail!
'I only get one phone call.
'You think I wanna talk to some
goddamn fucking machine?'
Is that all we got
from Lafayette Street?
- It's all the arrests.
- You got something else?
Well, I got this,
uh, missing persons report.
A what?
Why didn't you tell me?
''A.J. Shepherd.''
I wonder if that's the guy
I busted five years ago.
- It's not an official report.
- Then what is it?
It's a little strange.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Okay.
There you go.
I'm sorry I can't bring you more.
- Well, well, A.J. Shepherd.
- Bosch! What are you doing here?
- You called my precinct.
- What is this, some kind of bad joke?
Yeah.
So, what's this all about?
-  Reverend?
- Yeah?
Would you come here a minute?
What is it, Doris?
Reverend, I have
a present for you.
Oh, oh.
- Hey, look at that!
-
- So, you're a reverend now, huh?
- Save it, Bosch.
Now, what kind of scam
you're running here?
- Look, Lieutenant...
- Captain.
- Oh, you're a captain now?
- You got it.
Well, look, Captain,
I didn't call up your precinct
so they would send you down here
to hear your two-bit opinion
of my life, all right?
Look, just get to the point, Shepherd.
What's this about missing persons?
Oh, Jesus! Would you just
chill out? Please?
- It's my family.
- Family?
You mean,
your flock, congregation?
My regulars. My people here.
You wanna hear this or not?
Shoot.
I've been looking all over
for these people. I can't find 'em.
- Where do you think they'd be?
- Some of them are street people.
They're probably out
on the street somewhere,
but I got undergrounders here,
people who live underground.
I know that people
live underground. So what?
So that's the people
that are missing.
Look, in my cellar
I got a hole broken through the wall.
That hooks up
with an old sewer system down there.
It's a regular labyrinth
of tunnels and caves.
That's where these people live.
Ten, twelve of my regulars.
They come up here
for soup every day.
Those are the people
that disappeared.
- All of them?
- Yeah, all of them,
but it's just my underground people.
You understand that?
Since when?
It's been almost
two weeks now.
You haven't seen any of them
for two weeks?
- No.
- One guy, Val.
Now, you watch your step, Bosch.
Remember, you don't belong here.
Gog and Magog.
Yeah, well, uh...
Val, I understand
you used to live underground.
What made you
change your mind?
On each side of the throne
there are four living creatures
filled with eyes
in front and behind!
Creatures?
You're talking
about your friends?
Are they still down there?
I know your work.
You go by the name
of being alive!
And you are dead!
- Now, listen, pal.
-
They have the power
to shut the sky!
They have the power
to shut the sky.
Where the hell
did he get a knife like that?
All the undergrounders
are looking for weapons now, man.
Guns and knives.
I told you to be careful.
Don't be scared.
Where are you goin', man?
- I've gotta go check in.
- Check in?
Hey, Bosch!
Who are you callin'?
No. How do I know
you didn't take something.
How do I know
you didn't give us anything?
You have any idea
why she'd take my gun?
Not any good ones.
- Where you know her from anyway?
- Just around the neighborhood.
Do you go to movies together?
Is she your steady date?
- Get the hell out here.
- Yes, of course.
You ready, honey?
- I got him.
- Stay on him.
Pigs! Suck a duck!
Hey, Jackson,
they finally let you off the desk, huh?
- Hi, Murph.
-  What's happened?
Nothing going on.
Same old shit, Murphy.
Nothing, huh?
Sounds interesting.
Listen, Murphy,
I'm really busy.
Yeah, it's not surprising
what with nothing going on, I mean.
You walked up behind a cop
and took his gun?
- I tried.
- What do you want with a gun?
It's not for me,
it's for Victor.
- Have you got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
You have any bandages?
Yeah.
Forget it, Bosch.
I lost him.
- Really, you're going through here?
- Yeah.
I don't know why you two couldn't
just live in a big cardboard box
- like everybody else.
-
Here, take this bag.
Are you leaving
little breadcrumbs behind
- so we can find our way out of here?
-
- Come on.
- We gotta go through here?
Come on!
I'm gonna get all dirty.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Blood!
What the hell!
Why is everybody so afraid?
- Come on.
- What the hell is going on?
- Come on!
- What...
You know, Mrs. M,
there's a whole lot you're not telling me.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, look...
Let's start at the beginning.
Why the hell does Victor need a gun?
He needs it,
he says he needs it.
- Yeah, great answer...
- Up here.
- We're gonna go up here?
- Yup. Come on.
- You afraid of heights?
- No.
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Come on!
- Whoa!
- Hugo!
That's the man
who took your picture.
You don't remember him?
Sure, you do.
Okay, come on.
Oh, my god, what the hell
happened to him?
Did you get it?
- Did you get the gun?
- No.
I got some bandages.
I don't need no bandages.
I need a gun.
What do you want
a gun for, Victor?
Shoot...
Shoot them.
- Shoot who?
- Ugly fuckers.
What ugly fuckers?
Mean, ugly fucker
that comes around here.
- What's he talkin' about?
- He's sick!
Can't you see he's wounded?
Right, Victor...
Do you remember me,
George Cooper?
I don't know if you remember, but...
We ought to get this cleaned up.
Maybe put a new bandage on it,
maybe get you to a hospital.
- I don't need any hospital!
- Hugo!
Don't you hurt him.
Don't hurt him.
He's gonna help us.
'A bag lady
tried to steal a gun.
'The guy who bailed her out
is George Cooper.
'He shot an article on the people
down there. I have a copy of it right here.'
This article doesn't identify
any of the people in these pictures.
I thought maybe, you could.
Why don't you ask
the photographer?
Frankly, I can't decide
whether to talk to him or tail him.
It's a buck dancer's choice,
my friend.
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it?
I don't get...
I don't get you, brother.
You run in and out of here
like the fucking Mad Hatter...
You don't even know what you're looking
for, Bosch! You make me nervous.
I just want to know
if you know any of these people.
Why do you want to know them?
What's the motivation here, Captain?
Puttin' in so much of your time
to help me track down
a few undergrounders? Come on!
Alright, there are other people
missing as well.
Aha.
Who? Important people?
Your call wasn't
the only one we got.
We've had several
missing persons reports
from this neighborhood
in the last two weeks.
- Still doesn't wash, Bosch.
- Look, am I wasting my time...?
Hey, I put in a call...
A missing persons complaint...
I get a police captain
coming down here twice, in one day.
Fishy, fishy.
Is everybody getting scared?
You tell me who's missing, Bosch.
We lose the mayor down there?
Or the president?
- Or your mom disappear?
- My wife.
Alright?
Alright.
Why didn't you tell me this?
Look, I'm really sorry.
When did it happen?
Late last night.
She must've gone out
to walk the dog.
Hey, do you live around here?
Couple of blocks over.
Look, Bosch.
You gotta be straight with me.
This lady's name is
Mrs. Monroe.
She doesn't live down here,
her brother lives down here.
- Hey, wait, this is him. That's him.
- Victor. That's his buddy, Hugo.
They're undergrounders.
God...
George Cooper.
I don't know him,
but I've seen him around.
Okay?
Does that help you any?
Maybe.
Alright.
Your turn.
You tell me somethin'.
What?
About the EPA probe.
- What about it?
- You tell me.
It's a routine inspection
of the subways and sewers.
It happens every year.
How do you know about it?
I always know
when that probe's going on.
My customers
start gettin' jumpy.
Those clowns, they go down
there in their space suits.
They scare everybody
out of there.
- It's usually over in a week, right?
- So?
So, this year
it's been going on for four weeks.
It's still going on.
Didn't you know that?
Come on.
The week after everybody
disappeared,
I called the Environmental
Protection Agency.
- I asked 'em what was going on.
- What'd they say?
They said nothing's going on.
They said the probe
was over for three weeks,
that no one had been
down there since.
Why would they lie about it?
God, you don't have a clue,
do you, Sherlock?
This ain't no disco.
There's all sorts of shit
down there.
Hey, let me show you
some of the stuff I found.
Check this out.
Huh? You like?
Okay. Look at this.
N-R-C. You know what this is?
This thing detects
accumulated radiation,
they wear these things
in nuclear power plants.
How do you know that?
I used to be
a nuclear physicist.
I saw it on TV.
Alright.
Let's go.
So, anyway, this stuff
made me very curious.
I called up the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
Tell them that I wanted to return some
of their stolen property that I'd found.
- Mm-hm.
- The guy on the phone got nervous.
Started you know...
Passing me on to people...
Passing me on to two other droids.
Nobody wanted to come up
with any explanations to me.
But they were insistent on knowing
who I was, who I talked to...
- Where I'd been.
- Yeah, I get the point.
Yeah, good.
Here, hold this.
- You're going down there?
- Yup.
- What the hell's this food about?
- Oh, I left that for the shy ones.
It's a scary world up there.
Looks like they lost
their appetite.
Ugh. Smells great down here.
Hey. Whoa.
- What is it?
- Looks like a Geiger counter.
I told you there was
something going on.
Well, let's see.
What the hell was that?
- Hi.
- Can we talk now?
- I uh...
- George, sit down.
I gotta develop some photographs
and get them over to Derek's. I gotta.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, on second thought,
maybe Derek can wait a while.
Dr. Bremner called
this afternoon, it's official.
I'm pregnant.
- You're going to have a baby?
- Hm.
That is one of the side effects
of being pregnant.
There are alternatives.
Dr. Bremner wanted to know
if I was interested in, uh...
The alternative.
What'd you say?
I told him I'd let him know.
- Are you interested in an alternative?
- I don't know.
I'm sitting here, trying to think
if it's fair to bring a child into the world
who's gonna have a zombie father
that won't talk to anybody.
Me?
Yeah.
Lauren, do you...
Do you wanna have a kid?
I don't know!
I'm thinking about everything, you know,
that I never thought about doing...
- Gone.
- Not necessarily.
Do you want me to have a kid?
I'll support
whatever decision you make.
But I think
that it's gotta be your decision.
I don't believe it. You're not going
to tell me if you want me to have a kid?
Look, it's not fair! It's your body,
it's your career, all that stuff.
And... Our baby.
If I said that I wanted to have it,
would you want to have it?
- Yeah.
- Alright.
We're having a kid.
George and Lauren aren't in
right now, but if you want to,
leave a message
when you hear the beep.
- Beep.
-
'Look, George, I'm trying
to maintain my sense of humor.
'But you said you'd be here two hours
ago. Was that a joke? Please tell me.
'I'd like to laugh too.'
Crosby and Spring.
I think it is.
Look both ways.
Before any cars come,
nothing's coming, remember that?
Honey, I want to go
into this phone booth and...
We'll have to wake Uncle Art.
And find out where we're going.
Come on in, dear.
And close the door.
Just wait a minute, hon.
Stay there.
6-7...
Art...
Art, I'm sorry to wake you,
I'm sorry to wake you.
Yeah, yeah, we're here.
We're here.
Uh, but uh... We got on
the subway downtown, but...
We're lost, Art.
We're lost...
- What's going on?
- We have a kid who's hysterical.
She's makin' up a story.
- What makes you think it's a story?
- What? Are you kidding?
She says some monster came out
of the sewer and ate her grandfather.
Sanderson, get me
Chief O'Brien.
- Sir...
- Just get him.
Jackson. Post men
on all the street corners
within a 10 block radius
of Lafayette and Spring.
At least two men per corner.
- All of them?
- All of them.
Pull them off other precincts,
if you have to.
Then cover the subways.
At least four men per station.
Put out an APB on Flora Bosch.
- Your wife?
- Sir, I've got O'Brien.
O'Brien?
You call the Commissioner's office
and tell him we're coming
there at 12 o'clock sharp.
'Oh, and uh...
Tell him to have someone
'from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission with him.
Are you crazy, Bosch?
- 'I can't tell him that.'
- You tell him.
'And tell him if he's not there,
he can pick up the afternoon papers
'and read all about his involvement
in the NRC cover-up.'
Hey, Bosch, can't get enough, huh?
You got it, Rev. Come on, grab
your evidence. You're coming with me.
- Where are you going?
- We got a date downtown.
What do we need
this guy for, anyway?
Are you kidding? I accused the goddamn
Commissioner of a cover-up.
- You got me.
- Yeah.
I got you.
And a six year old kid
who thinks she saw a monster.
If this guy doesn't have
somethin' solid, I'm through.
- Hey, Cooper. Open up!
- He's not there.
What do you wanna do?
Well, we gotta
get in there, somehow.
Hey, that's breaking and entering.
You're...
...under arrest, Shepherd.
Hey, this is your friend
from the magazine, isn't it?
That's Victor, yeah.
- What the... What's this?
- It's his leg.
Oh, my god...
Holy shit.
Gentlemen, may I present Mr. Wilson
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Chief O'Brien,
Captain Bosch, and uh...
A.J.
And Mr. A.J.
Alright, Captain.
I guess, this is your meeting.
It'd better be good.
As you all know...
I've recently been ordered to ignore
what amounts to, uh...
An alarming number
of disappearances in my precinct.
We're all here right now,
because...
I can't do that anymore.
For one thing,
I have reason to believe
that a number of these people
have been murdered.
And I believe that these murders are
somehow connected to the probe
that's going on underneath the streets
of this city at this very moment.
Nonsense, Bosch.
Look, we're as concerned about
those disappearances as you are.
But there's no evidence of murder.
And as to any connection
with the underground... Preposterous.
It's hot down there,
Commissioner.
Don't tell me the NRC
doesn't know about that.
Mr. Wilson.
Is this why I was invited
to this meeting?
Who is this man?
I went to this man's
soup kitchen last night...
Soup kitchen!
Because he reported
And he took me down where these
people used to live, underground.
And that's where we found
this Geiger counter.
Granted, that doesn't necessarily
implicate you, sir.
But let me tell you what happened.
We turned it on, it was still working,
and it began to surge.
We were standing still.
But this thing went
as high as it could go.
It lit up like a god damn
Christmas tree!
Then it eased right back down to normal,
like something hot
was moving down there.
Nonsense, Bosch.
Quite often, there's a, uh...
Surge when you turn those things on,
it's a typical equipment malfunction.
It doesn't mean a thing.
What about all the stuff
we found down there?
I can't be held responsible for everything
that washes up in the sewer.
Anything else?
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
A young girl saw something.
She said it was a monster. Dragged
her grandfather down into the sewers.
Do you have anything else?
That's what I thought.
Forget this!
Wasting my time here.
You guys wouldn't know the truth
if it came up and bit you!
I'll take my pictures
somewhere else.
Pictures?
Yeah. I took a camera down there,
I took some pictures.
But you guys
wouldn't be interested.
Well, you want to see 'em?
Do you?
Well, I'll...
I'll show you one.
This is a picture of a man
that saw a monster.
Here's a picture of a bite
taken out of his leg.
Does that look like anything
you've ever seen before?
Here's a close-up of it.
Maybe you have
some glib explanation for that!
Now, do you wanna talk
about this?
Or should I go discuss this
with the newspapers?
I was just thinking...
Uh-oh. What were you
just thinking?
If we're gonna have a kid,
where are we going to live?
I thought that was settled.
We sell your father's house,
- we get a place of our own.
- Yeah, but I was thinking
why sell one place to live in,
just to get another?
- Wow.
- It's a nice house.
It'd be a nice place
for a kid growing up.
Yeah, but it's in the suburbs.
- Oh, no.
- Safe.
I hate to think of our kids
growing up here. It's scary.
My work is here.
Millbrook's a nice town.
Lots of quaint,
old aldermen and ancient farmers.
I don't want to talk about it now,
I'm in too good a mood.
- I might agree to anything.
- Yeah?
Glad to hear that.
I think it's time you and I
had a little talk, Mr. Cooper.
Who are you?
That's the problem.
I know who you are.
George Cooper,
prominent fashion photographer.
Nobody knows me.
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you?
Murphy. Freelance reporter.
You know
you were wearing a tail yesterday?
- What?
- That's right.
From the police department,
no less.
You must be a pretty important
fella, fella.
This should go
no further than this room.
About three weeks ago,
the Environmental Protection Agency
encountered slightly elevated radiation
levels in the Lafayette Street area.
Well, where's this radioactivity
coming from?
Do you remember that story that leaked
out about us wanting to, uh...
transport radioactive materials
through Manhattan?
Sure. There was a big stink
about it in the press.
Didn't somebody get a court order
restraining you from doing it?
That's right.
The case is still under appeal.
In the meantime,
we can't move the stuff.
You see, it's already here.
The order is preventing us from,
uh... moving it out.
'George Cooper.
'Suddenly just chucks it all,
and drops out of sight.
'Resurfaces six months
later with a...
'An award winning pictorial essay on
derelicts who hang out in the sewers.'
So?
Look, everybody wants
to be rich and famous.
But given the choice,
most people prefer to be rich.
It's really rare to find someone
who prefers fame.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Sure, you do. I prefer fame myself.
- Just hasn't come my way, yet.
- That is not why I did it.
- Oh, of course not.
- He wasn't out to win any awards.
Just wanted to do
something relevant.
- Oh! Relevant!
- Yeah.
Oh. That's a bad word. It went off
the okay word list years ago.
Look, what is this all about? What do
you want? An interview or something?
- I want a story.
- A story about what?
- About the sewer people.
- Oh, I see.
I did a story about some people
who happen to live in the sewer.
I'm not a reporter, I don't want to have
anything to do with the press.
- Goodbye.
-  Forget the press!
What about the people
down in the sewer?
- Come on, now.
- You figure it out.
You may not know, but there's NRC men
crawling all over this goddamn city.
Something's going wrong, and it's so
bad, nobody wants to talk about it.
The cops are going nuts trying to figure
out why a bag lady wants a hand gun.
They even start following you.
How does this tie in
with the people that are missing?
- Well, now...
- I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to him.
- There's no cause to be insolent, here.
- Eat it!
What about the disappearances?
I'm aware
of some alleged disappearances.
The little girl said
that she saw a monster!
- Was she right?
- I don't know.
- I think she was.
- I'm not prepared to, uh...
concede the existence
of any monster.
The fact that these people
are disappearing
at the same time
that your guys go down.
You're telling me that that is just
some sort of bizarre coincidence?
We don't have to listen to the lunatic
ravings of this paranoid hippie.
I just want to know
what is going on here!
Why? So you can get your name
in the papers?
- So I can help!
- We don't want your help.
Why not? I don't believe this,
I just... I don't believe you!
What are you trying to hide?
You saw it.
You saw the monster.
Is that what
you're going to tell the paper?
That you're afraid of monsters?
It's just what I'm going to tell them,
if you don't fill me in!
Go ahead, go scream
your fool head off.
This has been really fun, boys.
You, at least you...
You kept your mouth shut.
You're a fool.
And you, sir, are a liar!
- I'll see you all on the front page...
- You've got no evidence.
You're blind, buddy!
Have a nice day.
Long hair, carrying a paper bag.
He just left.
Follow him. High priority.
You're an idiot, Bosch, you know that?
You've really done it now.
- C.H.U.D.?
- What?
- C-H-U-D.
- Here, let me see.
Give me that. Where do you think
you are, high school?
- That's a classified government file.
- And what does it stand for?
- That's not important.
- I'm through playing games.
Either you tell me what
C.H.U.D. stands for,
or I'm going to the newspapers.
- Well, I have to get clearance.
- You got a call on four.
Wilson here.
What? Really?
Okay, you know what to do.
Two gas company guys
just found it.
A cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.
A C.H.U.D. Alright?
It's dead.
- Mr. Wilson.
- Doctor.
It's good to see you. You'll have to put
on one of these suits before we go in.
Gentlemen.
There's every indication
this once was human.
It's dressed in the rags
of a Bowery bum.
- Well, let's have it.
- You realize this is just preliminary.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- It was a gas leak, alright.
- Death by asphyxiation.
- Good. Thank you.
Okay, that's it.
I'm going ahead with the clean- up.
Well, wait... Wait a minute.
How do you know there aren't
more of those things down there?
Of course there aren't any more.
It was a freak accident.
It couldn't happen again.
I'm sending my men back to work.
Alright, you do that.
But I'm sending a team
armed with flame throwers
right down there with them.
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- You what?
I can't afford the publicity.
If you do that, every paper
in town will be onto it.
- Well, I can fix it, so they won't.
- You won't do it at all.
If I have to make it an order,
I'll make it an order.
I don't take orders from you!
Sorry, Bosch.
Wilson's in charge.
I understand how you feel. But like it
or not, we're gonna do this my way.
Okay, I'm on the bottom now.
Do you read me?
Hey! What the hell's going on here?
Alright, men. Fan out
and form a solid line across the tunnel.
Now, Bosch. You leave this to me.
Just watch the monitor.
You'll see
there's nothing down there.
Son of a bitch.
- Parker, this is Bosch. You read me?
- 'Loud and clear.'
Roger. Hang on.
- We're ready.
- You're making a big mistake.
- Beg your pardon?
- You've had your laugh,
- now get those men out of there.
- I'm busy, Wilson.
- Benson?
- 'Yes, sir?'
- Get those cops outta there.
- What, are you kidding?
Your man has a camera.
Mine has a flame thrower.
Okay, Parker, move 'em out.
'We're at the first intersection.'
Which way?
You're a college graduate.
You figure it out.
I can wait as long as you can.
The, uh...
The north tunnel.
Take the north tunnel.
But check it out, first.
'Everything looks clear.
- 'We're moving out.'
- Don't take any chances.
First sign of trouble,
get the hell outta there.
Move it!
I think I see something moving
up ahead in the tunnel.
Get those flame throwers working.
- I'm trying to see what it is first.
- Forget it.
'If it isn't saying hello,
I don't care what it is.'
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.
- Tell them to speed it up.
- 'Radiation level's going up.'
- I see something, there in the flames!
- Are you crazy?
- Nothing could possibly survive in...
- 'Radiation level's going up!'
Parker?
Parker?
Parker!
I've got to go along with
Bosch now, Wilson.
- The people have to be warned.
- No.
Come on, Wilson. How many
of those things do you think there are?
- We'll stop them.
- How?
- With gas.
- Gas?
We can't use gas,
it's too dangerous.
My men are doing
an autopsy right now.
They'll come up with
a dozen ways to kill those things.
Meantime we just sit around
on our thumbs, right?
Come on, Bosch,
you've got men out all over the city.
Who's gonna get hurt?
Yeah, admittedly, the guy's a little wacky,
but suppose for an instant that he's right?
So what if he is?
We don't want to get involved.
I've been down there,
you know?
Well, is there
something going on?
No, there's nothing
going on, but...
So leave it alone.
Gone.
Prints of Victor's leg are gone.
And that's
the only thing that's...
Honey, have you been
in my dark room?
No.
Hello, Murphy?
This is George Cooper.
I want my photographs back.
I think we ought to have a little talk.
I'll meet you on the northbound side
of Chambers Street station
in about half-hour. Bye.
You look terrible.
What the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
What's going on, Bosch?
I saw our monster.
We're not going anywhere
and I'm not showing you anything
unless you give me
my pictures back.
I don't have your pictures.
The police have your pictures.
Police. You're still
putting out that crap?
Why would the police
take my photographs?
- There's a cover-up going on.
- Cover-up.
You write this political bullshit?
Cover-up of what?
I don't know, because I don't know
what was in those photographs.
The only way to find out
is for us to go down there.
- You wanna go down there?
- Yeah, I wanna go down there. Now.
Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin'.
God.
- What are we gonna do, Bosch?
- I don't know.
Wilson is toying with the idea
of flooding the sewers with gas.
What? God, that guy is a madman!
He is a madman.
Gas could drive those
things up here.
Great, great.
What I'm saying is,
this isn't the safest place to be.
I heard you the first time.
You wanna lift somewhere?
No, I gotta cook dinner.
Keep your eye on that flame.
We can't wait any longer.
I've ordered my men
to prep the city gas lines.
We'll seal off
every tunnel in the area,
divert some of the gas mains
back into those tunnels.
If there are
any more incidents, we'll...
We'll turn
those mains back on.
Are you crazy?
You'll blow up the whole city!
I'm not gonna flood the whole city,
only, uh, a section of Soho.
- Shh...
- What?
You hear something?
No.
Listen, I did.
Holy...
What the hell
are you doing with a gun?
You said Victor knows something.
If Victor wants a gun,
I want a gun.
Come on.
Light. Light. Ah!
Hey, Val!
Hey, Val!
- Val.
-
Jesus!
Hey, look, Val, man.
You got to get out of here.
Get out of here, man.
It's dangerous.
Look, the sky's falling.
The sky's gonna shut.
It's gonna shut, Val.
Go on.
Go on.
Get out.
-  Sky.
- Sky, yeah. Get out.
Go on.
Sky... Sky!
Val?
Val?
Oh!
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
Wilson!
Wilson... Wilson!
Wilson! Wilson!
Wilson!
Now, this is it.
We have to go right through here.
Oh, you and your damn gun!
Come on.
That's it, Murphy. You're on your own
as far as I'm concerned.
I told you, I didn't want
any more of this bullshit.
I mean, I have to be down...
Shit.
Murphy!
Goddammit.
Shit.
Damn it.
Oh, shit.
Are you the one who found it?
Where is it?
Oh, my God,
it's his wife!
Shit!
-  Get him out of there.
-  Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Why don't you
let us take you home?
Home?
- Bosch, come on.
- She...
She just went back to college.
She always wanted to teach.
Used to stay up half the night.
Studying.
Then she'd go out and...
...walk the dog.
Yeah, police?
I found a mangled dog
hanging in my basement
and I'd like to have someone
come check it out.
Uh, 7 of 6.
- Cut it out, will you?
- Moron!
- What'll it be, boys?
- Rare cheeseburger and a coke.
- Same here.
- Coming up.
- Nice legs.
-  Stop it.
- I heard that.
- Yeah?
I bet you heard it before too.
Go on.
- Where'd you learn to cook like this?
-
You're asking for it.
I've been asking for it
all my life.
Just never get it.
- Shouldn't you boys be on duty?
- Nah.
Justin!
Justin, dinner!
Justin!
-
-
'Two minutes
to air time. Are you ready to go?'
'Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna say.
'It doesn't make any sense.
No witnesses, no bodies, just blood.
'And the place is crawling...
But the officials won't talk.'
What the hell is this?
Right in this area.
I want your team to take the north,
yours south,
yours east, yours west.
I want ever manhole sealed off
in a 10 block radius. Right?
Forget about the water mains.
Concentrate on the gas mains
and the sewer mains.
Forget about subway grating.
Now remember, those trucks
are rigged to explode
on impact from below
so watch the potholes.
God!
Victor!
You killed my brother!
- You Cooper?
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- Who are you?
I run the soup kitchen.
- On Kenmore.
- Yeah, right.
Man, this is crazy.
- Come on.
- Thank God they deliver!
Have you seen enough?
Is this enough for you?
We can't wait any longer.
We have to start pumping gas.
What about the subways?
What about the power lines?
If we stop the subways,
we'll kill every power line under the city.
Why not? I mean,
you've killed everybody here.
All these people are dead
because of you, Wilson.
My wife is dead because of you,
you son of a bitch!
Easy, Bosch. Easy.
This is your responsibility, Wilson.
Someone's got to stop you
and it's gonna have to be me.
You go back to the car, Captain.
You understand me?
You go back to that car
and you wait for further orders, Captain.
The media is not gonna
wait much longer.
We're going to have
to make it a statement.
Shit.
'I'm standing in front of what appears
to be the scene of a massacre.
'But so far there has been
no official confirmation
'as to exactly what happened here.
'In fact, at the present time'
no one even will confirm
that anyone was killed.
There are, uh, seven manholes
at that intersection.
These are the only two
that go anywhere. Seal 'em.
So as a precaution we're going
to kill the power to the subways
and close down the stations.
'Are you saying
that a gas explosion
- 'caused the wreck of this diner?'
-  'I'm not saying that.
'And it would be imprudent
to speculate on that at this point.
'I'm merely saying that a situation
exists that's made it necessary
'for us to temporarily divert
some of the gas lines
'into the city's sewer system.'
Now, what the hell is this?
- He started.
- He started what?
- Closing off the fucking tunnels.
- Why?
They're gonna start pumping gas
down here to kill those things.
- This is the only way that I know.
- Let's beat 'em to the next one.
Goddammit!
Get up!
Holy shit, man! Holy shit!
This is... Look at this!
- This is radiation.
- I know.
Wait! Wait, wait.
Wait! What is this?
This is more of that radioactive shit.
No, it's different, look!
That's weird.
''Contamination hazard
urban disposal?''
This shit's contaminated.
This shit is toxic waste.
Wilson!
This is Wilson's poison dump!
I don't believe it.
Look at all this shit.
They must have been dumping
this stuff down here for years
It's got to be Wilson. But what the hell's
the NRC got to do with all this!
Holy shit!
C.H.U.D.
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir, they're all covered.
Start the gas.
What is that?
Cooper. Cooper!
Help! No!
Shh! Shh! Shh!
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's alright.
-
- It's okay. Okay.
Shit, man!
- Noxious gas.
- What?
Wait a second!
There's a camera over there.
- There's a camera.
- What?
- There's a camera.
-
This is it, man.
Hey! Mayday! Mayday!
Look, hey,
we're trapped down here.
There's no audio.
- Where's the headset?
- Let's just get out of here.
There's a headset jack on this thing.
All we have to do is find the headset.
Let's get out of here, man.
'Is anybody there?'
- Get Captain Bosch!
- Keep going. Just keep talking.
- 'Get Captain...'
- Who the hell are you?
'Hey! Get somebody.'
'Hey, Captain, this is Sanderson.
'I just got a very strange
phone call from some NRC guy.
'He said it was urgent.
'He said, ''Tell Bosch,
he's got the Reverend on the video
'''in the NRC control room.''
'Do you know what that means?'
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Somebody help me!
-
- Ah!
Ah!
-
-
'Reverend?
This is Bosch. Do you read me?'
- Yeah, Bosch.
- Where are you?
I'm here. I'm at that place
where your guys got killed.
- All right, see the side tunnel?
- Yeah.
'About 100 yards
down that tunnel to the right'
there's a ladder to a manhole.
Be there. I'll open it.
Yeah, I'll be there.
I got to tell you something, man.
- It can wait.
- 'No, it can't wait. It's about Wilson.'
Come on, let's go.
Man, come on!
Step up the pressure.
We've got to have more gas.
May I have your attention?
This is an emergency!
Who has the key to the truck
parked in the corner
of Washington
and Dekalb Street?
There are people
trapped under a manhole.
We need to move the truck
to get them out.
- Who has the key?
- Right here.
What the hell
do you think you're doing?
We've already started the gas.
Those things will be looking
for a way out. It's too risky.
Too risky?
Oh, for who? For you?
What, afraid people are gonna
get wind of your filthy little project
and find out who you really are?
Give me the keys goddamn it!
Maybe the press would like
to hear about this. Hey, you guys!
Hey, all right! Come on.
All right, Bosch.
What are you gonna tell them?
For starters, I'll tell them there's more
than leaky canisters down there.
- So what does that mean?
- You're not from the NRC.
You'll cover for 'em
as long as it's convenient for you
but you don't care about that.
You want them to clean up their mess
before anybody finds out
what's really going on.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
I know what C.H.U.D. stands for.
Cannibalistic, my ass!
Contamination hazard
urban disposal.
You know, you're nothing
but the government garbage man.
You take industrial waste,
you take toxic slugs
from every research project
and dump it
under the streets of our city.
- Christ!
- You can't hide it anymore, Wilson.
Now give me the keys.
I'm gonna get those men out of there.
- I can't let you do that.
- It's over, Wilson.
I said, I can't let you do that.
How are you gonna cover up
killing a cop, huh?
I don't know. But I can't let
that story get out.
- You won't shoot me, Wilson.
- I will if I have to.
Isn't this it?
Move it! Police! Move it!
Stop the gas! Who's in charge?
- They've gotta stop the gas.
-  Stop it? Why?
My husband's down there.
Who's in charge?
- Some NRC guy...
- Show me...
- Where is he?
- He just went down there.
-
- It's jammed.
-  Hey, you guys down there?
- Bosch, hurry!
- I'm here.
-
What was that?
George, look out!
Bosch.
Come on. Get up! Get up!
He's trying to kill us.
Get up.
No!
- No!
-
Nice shot.
Bosch!
Nice shot!
