- Excuse me, do you speak—
- No.
-
Hello.
- Yes.
- Let him in.
- All right.
Studio 4.
Left.
Francesco is waiting.
- Thank you.
"SILENCE"
"THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX"
"DIRECTED BY GIANCARLO SANTINI"
- Come this way, Gilderoy.
Don't be afraid.
A new world of sound
awaits you,
a new world that requires
all your magic powers.
- Mr. Santini.
- He'll see you
when he has time.
Everything is ready.
It's all for you, Gilderoy.
- D120.
- Is that the first thing
you say
when you greet someone?
- Francesco,
can I go to lunch now?
- I scream better
on a full stomach.
- Okay, be quick.
You've got 15 minutes.
Now, how about
a proper greeting, huh?
What's wrong with you English?
You don't believe in handshakes?
No hugs?
No kisses?
Here.
That wasn't so painful, huh?
Don't worry,
You'll meet Santini.
He hasn't spoken about
anything else this week.
You know, Gilderoy this.
Gilderoy that.
You'll see.
Now, you must be tired, huh?
Why don't you have a seat?
- Actually, I'm fine.
No, I—I slept
the whole flight.
Actually, that reminds me...
-
Francesco...
Is it the bedroom scene
you wanted?
Come—
come, have a seat.
There's a little scene
I want to show you.
- Oh, before I forget,
there's a couple of receipts
from the flight.
I was wondering if...
- Of course.
I'll take care of that.
But not now.
Just give it to me tomorrow,
and I'll reimburse you
the money.
- So, uh, what is this?
- Your brief.
- Signora Collatina's
sacrificial attack is thwarted,
and the tables
are brutally turned.
- Strike a light.
What's he doing to her?
- Massimo and Massimo,
start the demonstration.
- I didn't quite know I'd be
working on this sort of film.
- What did you expect?
- Santini said something
about equestrian...
- Oh, yeah.
A horse-riding girl.
See?
She's just not horse-riding
anymore; that's all.
-
- All right, boys,
look what I've got for you.
Boss, these are for you.
Your favorites.
Fabio's the son of a very famous
Italian director.
- Hello.
- Hi. Ciao.
Eh!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Good to see your Italian
is improving.
- About that flight receipt...
- Elena, the secretary.
I told you from the beginning,
it is Elena who deals
with the expenses.
-
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna see
if her mic's too close or not.
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Sorry to be a pain,
but, um...
Could you deal with
this receipt?
- Deal?
- It's for my flight to Italy.
Just to get the money back.
- That's not my department.
Talk to Francesco.
- I did.
He mentioned that you deal
with reimbursements and such.
Um...
Maybe there's been
some innocent confusion.
Nobody's fault.
Just language and things.
Could you help me?
Strapped for cash.
Could you deal with it?
- So it's my department now?
- Yes.
- He's a producer.
What do you expect?
Don't get worked up
over a film like this.
- If you can call
such sordid trash a film.
If you want to discuss
film theory, do it after work.
Teresa and Monica
surreptitiously enter
and find a treatise
on witchcraft.
- Quick,
Signora Collatina is coming.
If she sees us here, we'll be
expelled from the Academy.
- Is that Latin?
-
- This confirms
what I suspected.
They are here.
They are under us.
- How was it?
- Can you play it again?
- Giovanni!
- This confirms
what I suspected.
-
Mantel clock,
- No time for love letters,
Gilderoy.
Help Silvia with the mic.
- I was thinking about
this scene.
- You were thinking.
Really?
- Yeah.
Just about these screams.
I don't think
her and Monica would—
- It's "she and Monica."
You don't say
"her and Monica."
It's "she and Monica."
- She and Monica.
- Mm-hmm.
- They are screaming
because they are scared.
It's a natural reaction,
but they don't want to be heard
by the others
in the riding academy.
- And?
- So maybe we shouldn't scream
so much in this scene.
- Really?
- Really.
- I think you shouldn't
always question
what I tell you to do
when you're being paid to work.
- Are we ready?
- Yeah, I've replaced
Teresa's mic with an omni,
so it should give it
more space.
- It's Silvia.
Teresa is there.
Silvia is here.
- So many names to remember.
- Just think of it
like your microphones.
Each one has a name,
and you remember.
- Giovanni?
into the poultry tunnel
underneath the Academy,
unaware of the witches'
putrid corpses.
I'm sure this is the place
where they were buried.
- There's nothing here,
I'm telling you.
- I'm sure of it.
It smells of chicken...
- So what is the beautiful Elena
saying?
- According to the scripture,
they were all tortured here.
-
She can't even scream
in Italian.
I didn't ask you to fake
an orgasm.
You can save that
for your next casting director.
Do it again.
I want to feel the fear.
-
- So is Santini coming today?
- He's very busy.
- Go get a glass of water
for this diva.
- Right you are, Francesco.
-
Take two. Chain saw effect.
- Francesco,
you won't believe who's here:
- Lorenzo, get her backing music
ready, okay?
and the first witch rises
from the dead
- The witches' revenge.
Now that they rise,
they will do exactly to others
what was done to them.
-
"SILENCE"
Let me feel this man.
This beautiful, crazy man.
Oh, Gilderoy,
this a very special day for me.
A beautiful and big
collaboration begins.
So... good studio?
- Yes, it's all right.
- Bigger than your studio?
- Gilderoy's studio
is just a garden shed.
- Only two in at a time.
- The mixing room here
is very special.
- Well, the Mallard needs
a service, but otherwise...
- What needs servicing?
- The Mallard high-pass filter.
- Really?
You know, when you meet someone
for the first time,
just try and discuss
only positive things.
It's good manners.
You hardly sound
like you're seconds away
from being penetrated
by a red-hot poker.
- I didn't know how intense
you want it.
- Well, I think
the general consensus
is that a red-hot poker
in a woman's vagina
- But an intensity
that reaches the other side.
Maybe now you will find
the inspiration
- What's going on?
- Just another scene
where Veronica
cannot use her imagination.
- Speaking of scenes,
I was gonna ask you what...
about the film.
- Hey, what do you mean?
- Like, just to know a bit
about what happens.
- No, Santini is busy—
- It's okay. It's okay.
Francesco.
This is a very specific vision.
But you must help me,
Gilderoy.
It's something I want you
to respect.
- No, it's not that.
It's just...
I've never worked
on a horror film before.
- Horror film?
This is not a horror film.
This is not a horror film.
This is a Santini film.
True, a Santini film
is violence, I know.
This is the life.
This is part
of the human condition.
Please, please, Gilderoy.
Don't call my film "horror"
again.
- Slip of the tongue.
- Don't worry.
It's okay.
Oh, .
Come on.
-
-
What are we celebrating?
- Just celebrate
whatever comes to your mind.
That's what usually happens
in this studio.
- Let's make toast!
-
-
Sounds a little watery.
Is there any fresh marrow?
The witch surprises Monica
in her sleep
and throws her
out of the dormitory window.
- Well, I was hoping for
a more dignified end than this.
- What are you
complaining about?
You can take it home
and cook it.
- I didn't know that you could
change my voice so much.
- You ever heard yourself
through one of these before?
- May I?
They told me what kind of films
you normally do.
- 1/4 inch is 1/4 inch,
whatever the film is.
- You never stopped to ask
Santini or Francesco
why they hired you.
It doesn't make you curious?
See you, Gilderoy.
- Be careful with that girl.
There is poison
in those tits of hers.
-
With all your saints,
Water of his wound,
wash over me.
Passion of Christ,
strengthen me.
Do not let me be separated
from you,
defend me from
the malicious enemy.
call me and bid me
to come to you.
That I may praise you
with your saints,
pulling a witch's hair out
during her interrogation.
"SILENCE"
- Beautiful long hair...
And now a face
just like a ghost.
It is a tragedy to lose hairs.
- How many more scenes
like this?
It's just—
sorry.
These interrogations.
- These things happened.
Yes.
This is history.
And a film director
must be true.
I hate what they did
to these beautiful women.
Really, I hate it.
But it is my duty to show.
The world must know the truth
and see the truth.
I hate it.
- Hate what?
Conchita's cooking?
- Look at him.
He's so hungry.
Look at him.
- What happened?
- It's called a power cut...
- A big tradition here.
- Oh...
La!
- What are you having?
- Watermelon.
we could sunbathe
up on the terrace.
- Hey, enough!
This is not a banquet.
This is for
the interrogation scene.
- What about
Massimo and Massimo?
- They're ill.
I know how much you love them,
but you can cope on your own
for now.
- Foley's not really my forte.
- Gilderoy,
everything is your forte.
This guy can turn a lightbulb
into a UFO.
- Really?
- Let's hear it!
- Show them the UFO.
He uses it for
children's programs.
-
- Whoa.
- Bravo.
- Gilderoy, can you do bats?
- No...
- Ask him to do
the UFO sound again.
- We've got piles of work
to get through.
- How is it?
- We need to do
the hair pulling again.
There's also a problem
with the condenser—
too much moisture
in the capsule.
- You stay here.
I'll ask Elena to make an order.
- Would you mind asking
if she's had any news?
- You mean,
you want your money again.
- It's just, you said—
- We said reimbursement.
And you think we're not gonna
give it to you?
- Yes.
I mean, no.
- You know,
I would appreciate it
if you trusted me more.
What I admired about you
was that you were an artist,
that you were doing this
for the love.
You know how many calls
we get every day
from people who want to
come here and work for nothing?
'Cause they love what they do.
Money is not their motivation.
But I'll put your request in
over the others.
And I'll ask Elena
to talk to the accountant.
-
Mum's doorbell,
Sorry.
Flashback to the priest
stabbing a witch's body
-
- Good job, Gilderoy.
- Hello.
-  Anyway, it's better
to talk when I finish.
- Has the order come through
for the replacement
ReVox servo drive circuit?
- No.
- Maybe tomorrow, then?
- Maybe.
- That thingamajig...
- I told you,
it's not my department.
- Yes, yes, uh...
Francesco said you said
there was someone in accounts.
- You want to speak to Luigi.
- Who?
- Luigi.
He has your receipt.
He's in the other building.
Here.
- It's ringing.
- Uh, Mr. Luigi?
-
He's in a meeting.
- Oh, well,
maybe you could help.
I have a receipt for a flight...
- You have to talk to Luigi
about receipts.
- Uh, c-c-could you tell him
that Gilderoy called?
- That's great.
Right you are.
- Jean-Michel Van Schouwburg
is waiting for you.
- Who?
- The goblin.
The dangerously aroused Goblin
prowls the dormitory
and tries in vain
to molest Teresa,
- Francesco...
- Lorenzo's saying you've been
messing with his faders.
Did you ask
if you could do that?
- No, I just thought
it would lower the noise floor.
- I think you're forgetting
this is not your studio.
Try and be more considerate.
-
"SILENCE"
- Please, Gilderoy,
don't let them hurt me.
- You missed the cue again.
Don't turn it off.
Just wait for it to come around
again on the loop.
Giovanni?
- Look, hold it still.
It's not gonna burn you.
Try to be more deliberate.
Here—
nice big sizzle.
Flashback to the interrogation
of a witch,
in which a red-hot poker
is inserted into her vagina.
- Soul of Christ,
sanctify me as well.
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
- I can't do this...
stuff.
- Gilderoy,
you're here to do a job.
Now, you do what I tell you.
It is just a film.
You're part of it.
You can see how all this
is put together.
What—what's your problem
with this?
- Maybe it's best I go home.
- Gilderoy,
let me just tell you
what it is
to be a professional.
It's very simple.
You cooperate.
You don't question.
You don't argue.
You don't look at your watch.
You just do the work
you're told to do
and keep your personal opinion
where it belongs.
Am I clear?
"SILENCE"
Flashback to the priest
drowning a witch
d d
- This tells us how to lift
the curse.
We have to conduct
a human sacrifice.
It's no surprise that
all these tortured witches...
- Francesco,
have you seen Fabio?
- He's hanging out
on the terrace.
- I've got a little present
for him.
- You didn't see
the recording light?
- Never mind.
We need to get this scene done.
- No problem. I just came by
to see how it's all going.
- You can't keep bringing
the dog in here.
We need him
for the frequencies.
Everyone knows dogs
can hear high frequencies.
- So you brought the dog here
for professional reasons?
- Make sure he doesn't poo
in the studio.
- Who?
Gilderoy or Alfonso?
Wait, wait.
I want a discussion.
How's everything?
- Fine.
- Francesco tells me
you are trying to escape.
-
No.
It's a misunderstanding.
- I thought so.
There's no reason to escape.
Gilderoy, this is going to be
a fantastic film.
Brutal and honest.
Nobody has seen this horror
before.
- You can say that again.
- Let me question you,
Gilderoy.
When you see these women,
do you see Catholic or witch?
Do you believe God, Gilderoy?
- I...
I'd rather not get technical.
- You English...
Always hiding.
How can I get close to you?
Is it so hard?
Where I come from,
we swallow the seeds.
-
- You are changed.
I feel it.
- No great shakes.
-
Signor Santini. Signor Santini.
- You and me, we will talk.
- What are you doing?
- This reminds me of home.
- The power cuts?
-
No.
The twigs.
-
How are you getting on
with Santini?
- All right.
- Really?
I overheard you trying to get
your money back for the flight.
If you talk to people
like that,
you'll never get anywhere
in this place.
- Why?
Was I being rude?
- That's exactly it.
You should be rude.
Nobody pays money here
unless they have to.
- I have asked several times.
- You don't just ask here.
You shake your fists,
and you shout.
You push these pigs until
you get them into the corner.
Be careful with Santini.
That baby smile
is there for a reason.
You don't see that?
- ON
Get me accounts.
Give me that phone.
- Listen, the game's up,
old boy.
-
What?
- No more jumping
through hooks.
You give me my money,
or I'll—
- Wait.
Just stop there, okay?
and there was no flight from
Heathrow on the 28th of March.
- But that's when I flew.
We can't issue
a reimbursement
for a flight
that never existed.
- Well, I'll call the airline.
I'll get the information
myself.
I'll call the airline!
- My throat's better now.
- We've moved on to Foley.
- Can I?
Just once more.
- Which reel?
- Forget the reel.
I just need to scream;
that's all.
- May I help you?
- He used me.
I knew he would.
I try my best to do my work,
and it's never good enough.
It always comes
to the same thing.
I'm just a whore to them.
Nothing more.
I said "no."
I said "no" so many times.
He kept touching me here.
I feel so cheap, Gilderoy.
I feel so dirty and cheap.
and show Santini
the real meaning of a curse.
Tonight, I'll destroy
what is most precious to him
and bring the bastard
to his knees.
"YOU PRESSED
ALL THE WRONG BUTTONS,"
"NOW TRY THE RIGHT ONES.
SILVIA"
-
Good morning, gentlemen.
I trust the day finds you
in good spirits.
Santini,
I must congratulate you
for the unique
motivational methods
I know how important it is
for a director
to show how priests
searched witches' bodies
So I find it strange
that you only bother searching
I do not have devil's marks
on either breast,
but you will find his marks
on all my tapes.
Yes, that's right.
Teresa has been erased.
- What did she say?
What the hell did you do
to her?
What's the big deal
with a bit of tickling?
- What are you doing?
Would you mind
cleaning this up?
- I'll check the backups.
- Boys, we've got cocktails
out on the terrace...
Did you get the dog
to rewind a tape?
- There's no need to behave
like that!
- Don't worry; we'll start again
with someone else...
- How? When?
There's no time!
I don't want anyone
like Silvia.
- Francesco,
Chiara's reel has been erased.
- That last girl
is really something.
She could even give the dog
a hard-on.
Giancarlo,
nothing will ever change.

sacrificial victim.
- Massimo and Massimo,
a bit slower this time.

Who's there?
Who's there?
I will call the police!
I will.

Who's there?

Without adequate light,
their survival depends on
the grazing of the grassland.
and the chalk downland
is ablaze with color.
The views from the North Downs
attract visitors from all over.
Salomon's Memorial offers
panoramic views of Dorking,
the South Downs,
and Leith Hill.
Some of our rarest orchids
adorn parts of Box Hill,
particularly the Burford Spur
and the Mole Gap beyond.
Box Hill's multitude
of habitats
make it a haven for all manner
of flora and fauna.
The glades and grassland
of the Gallops,
Donkey Green,
and Mickleham Downs,
along with the box and beech
woodlands of Juniper Top
with their flint, clay,
and chalk soils
are each as unique
as the different characters
that this is not the work
of a crazed killer
but the violent force
of undead witches.
But the violent force
of undead witches.
They strike and kill
at random.
They will find us
wherever we are.
and hope that this comes
to an end.
Teresa, I'd like to see you
in my office afterwards.
I believe you know something
about this curse.
-
Signora Collatina
tells her students
and that regrettably,
the massacres will continue.
- AH this destruction
breaks my heart.
Two students, Monica
and Valeria, such tender things
that this is not the work
of a crazed killer
but the violent force
of undead witches.
They strike and kill
at random.
They will find us
wherever we are.
Now we can only pray and hope
that this comes to an end.
Teresa, I'd like to see you
in my office afterwards.
I believe you know something
about this curse
- Signora Collatina's
sacrificial attack is thwarted,
and the tables
are brutally turned.
- Strike a light.
What's he doing to her?
- Massimo and Massimo,
start the demonstration.
- I didn't quite know I'd be
working on this sort of film.
- Santini said something
about equestrian...
- Oh, yeah,
a horse-riding girl, see?
She's just not horse-riding
anymore; that's all.
Do you mind if I go through
my lines?
I just walked out
to see how they were,
One by one, heads ripped off,
all feathers gone.
The parents
are literally screaming.
They were just a day or two
away from leaving the nest.
I was so much looking forward
to the next few days.
- Here comes the Sabbath,
there goes the cross.
Drunk on serpents' semen
and bloated with bile.
A whore's menstrual syrup
with a black widow's venom.
A chiffchaff's plumage
infested with lice.
Our vile, thick elixir
runs through your veins.
Here comes the Sabbath,
there goes the cross.
Here comes the Sabbath,
there goes the cross.
I'm sure this is the place
where they were buried.
Mumbling and moaning.
Listen.
- According to the scripture,
they were all tortured here.
See what happens
when you let Santini's dick
Teresa and Monica venture
into the poultry tunnel
unaware of the witches'
putrid corpses.
I'm sure this is the place
where they were buried.
Why else would
they try to keep us out?
According to the scripture,
they were all tortured here.
-
Even a hamster could do
a better job than that.
How about being
a little more convincing?
- Francesco,
I need to rewind the tape...
- Leave it.
Just let her scream.
-
-
- Gilderoy, go out there
and give her hell.
Are you going to do it
or not?
There's a terrible noise
coming from the headphones.
- Keep them on.
You need your cue.
-
Go to hell!
You and your film!
Get off me!
- Elisa, we need you!
- Father, we praise you
and proclaim you as our Lord.
Eternal Father,
the entire Earth worships you.
Angels sing to you
and the powers of heaven.
Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God of the Universe.
Heaven and earth
are full of your glory.
