Catch them.
Kill them.
What's wrong, Ronnie?
I Iove you, Jodie.
Suffolk County police.
May I help you?
Everybody's dead.
What do you mean,
"everybody's dead"?
A guy come running
into the bar and says...
...his mother and father are shot.
I've been to a Iot of crime scenes,
never seen one Iike this.
Six members of the family
were found last night...
...in bed, shot...
...and killed.
Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,
his wife and four of their children.
The sole survivor of the family...
...23-year-old
Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr...
...is said to have discovered
the bodies.
The police state
that for his own safety...
... they're holding him
in protective custody.
Five of the victims were found
shot facedown on their beds.
The sixth was found in a closet.
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.
Suffolk County police have charged
The accused told police
he heard voices...
...coming from within the house,
telling him to murder his family.
Oh, God!
Damn it.
Hi, Michael.
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?
George, what are you doing
to my mom?
Nothing.
-Yet.
-You perv.
Come on up here, Iittle man.
You can make it.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
Did you meet my dad?
No...
...never had the pleasure, pal.
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?
-Guess what.
-What?
-You can call me whatever you want.
-Anything?
-Yep.
-Cool.
-Anything.
-Cool.
Yeah.
-Stinky.
-Sure.
-Poopy-head.
-Yeah.
Crap-monkey-fart.
Okay, we gotta draw the Iine
somewhere, pal, that does it.
AII right.
-This sucks.
-You're not kidding.
Billy.
Look, maybe we'II grab you
something on the way to school.
-What do you say, huh?
-I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.
I'II drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.
-Mom, I'm 1 2 years old.
-Before you plan...
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.
We got a big day.
Why? Where are you guys going?
-Mom, can you help me?
-Oh, Michael.
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.
Not according to this.
-Well, then it's gotta be true.
-Think positive, babe.
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.
Look, when the business
is going good...
-...we're gonna--
-There.
-What?
-That's it.
-Look.
-Honey.
Baby, Iook, 41 2 Ocean Avenue.
-It's beautiful.
-What?
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.
They get Iike that when they think
they'II make a sale.
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.
Or not.
-Hi there.
-I'm Katherine Lutz.
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?
-George.
-This is an amazing house.
You are going to Iove it.
Just follow me in here.
Careful on the steps there.
Holy shit.
Excuse me.
Let me show you
the rest of the house.
This-- This is a mistake.
How's that?
No, I mean your ad in the paper.
This is--
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...
...and I know what a place
Iike this should cost.
And, you know, if this is--
Well, if this is true, then this is a--
The deal of a Iifetime.
And what is wrong with that?
-Come on.
-I Iove it.
-There's a vibrant history here.
-Vibrant history, George.
In fact, the house was built
in 1 692, at Ieast the basement.
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.
Wow, that's impressive.
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.
And the view's--
Well, have a Iook for yourselves.
There's a boathouse.
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?
Actually, George has a speedboat.
This place sounds
Iike it's made for you.
And this is your basement.
As you can see,
it's very spacious.
It can be a game room,
a playroom.
Well, Iet's-- Let's have a Iook.
I'II just wait up here.
Yep, Iooks Iike a basement.
So, what do you guys think?
-I think you Iook foxy in that skirt.
-Will you stop it? Come on.
Yes, yes, okay?
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.
Okay, Iook, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.
We deserve this, George.
You deserve this.
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so Iittle.
-Kathy--
-Maybe today is the day it all pays off.
-We'II make sacrifices.
-Huge sacrifices.
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...
...this is the Iife we want.
-We're happy?
-Yes, we're happy.
She's happy. I'm broke.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
So Iook, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?
There's always a catch.
There was a tragedy, a crime...
-...a murder.
-I'm sorry, what?
In the house?
Several people, a family.
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.
It is a distant memory now.
And the house is fine.
Really.
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?
Well, houses don't kill people.
People kill people.
Just-- Excuse us.
Do you think we can make it work?
You know what?
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.
-Really?
-I'II work out of the basement...
...and you can, well...
-...sell one of the kids.
-Hey.
A Iittle one.
We're rich! We're rich!
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.
Wait.
-You say your prayers?
-Yep, said them twice.
-What did you pray for?
-If I tell you, it won't come true.
Why don't you tell him the truth.
-What?
-Praying doesn't do any good.
William.
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.
Don't say that.
Sometimes things happen in Iife
that can't be explained, Billy.
Billy, Iook at me.
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by Iiking George.
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...
...and maybe one day
something more.
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.
For you too?
For me too.
How's Billy?
He'II be fine.
-First call.
-First call.
-Lutz residence, how may I help you?
-Can I talk to my daughter, please?
Yeah, sure, she's--
She's right here. Okay.
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.
It's embarrassing now.
Hello?
-Hey, Ma.
-Hi.
No, we're all moved in.
-Yeah, Ma.
-Are you cold?
No, Ma.
Yeah.
-What is it, baby?
-Nothing.
-Are you okay, baby?
-No.
I don't feel well.
-Give me a kiss.
-I can do it, I can do it.
No, you can't.
Come here, come here.
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?
-Chelsea?
-Hey, Mommy.
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?
-The girl who Iives in my closet.
-Oh, yeah?
-And what's her name?
-Jodie.
You know there are plenty of other
Iittle girls to play with in town too?
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.
Is that Jodie?
No, that's someone else.
Who?
I'm not supposed to say who.
She says it's an A-hole.
You are not allowed
to say that word.
George, George.
-Look what I found.
-What is that? Where'd you find that?
Harry and I found it.
-Where?
-In the basement.
Not the basement.
My office.
You Iisten to me.
You don't go down there.
Understand?
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?
Go on, go help your mom.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
-How are you feeling?
-Good, good.
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.
Billy will Iove that.
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?
Where's Chelsea?
Where's Chelsea?
Chelsea?
Chelsea?
Chelsea!
Chelsea.
Hey, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, sweetie.
-Chelsea, go to George.
-Come on. Hey, give me your hand.
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.
Jodie wanted to see the boat.
Somebody should have been
watching you.
Billy, get up.
Billy, I gotta go pee.
Chelsea.
Goddamn it, Harry.
Seriously. You trying to kill me?
Come on, get away from there.
Hey, that's enough.
Hey!
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.
What is that?
You tell me.
-Why don't you come back to bed.
-No, I can't sleep.
I'm sorry, baby.
Don't....
Don't talk to me Iike
I'm one of your kids, okay?
-What?
-That goddamn dog woke me up.
Billy's dog.
Found him in the boathouse.
-But you Iocked it.
-Yeah.
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.
You ready to talk
about those keys?
There's not a Iot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...
...George.
Get to work, buddy.
"Get to work, buddy."
"Katch 'em...."
George?
George?
George, you down there?
George?
What?
What's the matter?
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.
You Iook hideous.
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.
-Where's the babysitter?
-Babysitter?
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.
- I'm old enough.
-Baby, I know you can--
I'm not Ietting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't Iet her. I won't.
-She's not coming in.
-Billy, Iisten to me.
-I won't Ieave you alone.
-I can't believe you hired a babysitter.
-I told you I was old enough.
-Hi.
-I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
-Great.
Can I take your coat?
Okay.
Hi.
I'm Billy.
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?
Would you Iike me
to show you around?
No, it's okay.
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.
Kind of freaky being back here.
I'm Billy.
Yeah, I got you the first time.
Have a good night, Billy.
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?
Yeah. Definitely.
You feeling all right?
You know what?
I feel better.
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.
Come on, drink up.
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.
Hopefully, I won't have to.
Be right out.
Hungry?
Kid, you read my mind.
The kids, they're--
They're going through
a tough time.
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.
Yeah, well, we all are.
Do you feel different?
What do you mean?
About us.
About me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I feel Iike for the first time in my Iife,
I'm sure about something.
And that's you.
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my Iife making you happy.
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.
Some people say his tongue is fake.
I think it's all him.
Got this at a pinball arcade.
Cool.
So do you French?
Do I what?
Kissing, tongues.
No.
Did your family know the Defeos?
-The who?
-The family that Iived here before you.
No, we just moved here.
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?
No.
I really shouldn't be telling you this.
Your parents are gonna be pissed.
It's okay.
Stop. That's not how you play.
-I can't hear you.
-Stop it. Let me try.
You're killing him.
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that Iived here.
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.
So he kills it.
A few days Iater, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.
So you know what he did?
Wasted them.
How did he do it?
Do what?
You are way too young to hear this.
So cover your ears.
And don't Iisten.
A rifle.
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.
He killed his brothers
in this very room.
Right here.
In these beds.
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.
Actually, it's fucking sick.
Yeah.
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.
I suck at babysitting.
This was the Iittle brat's room.
Jodie's.
You know, they found her in there.
-Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
-Yeah?
Well, Jodie's--
What's the word? Dead.
Is not.
That Iittle shit got me fired.
Dare you to go in there.
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?
Okay.
Okay.
You're going to make her mad.
Come on, guys.
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.
Billy, Michael.
It's not opening. I can't open it.
-Unlock the fucking door.
-There's no Iock.
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.
Billy, Michael.
Let me out. Let me out of here.
Let me out of here!
What's going on?
Let me out.
Hi, Lisa.
Look what Ronnie did.
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Help me. Let me out!
I saw Jodie.
I saw Jodie.
Who's Jodie?
The Iittle girl.
She's dead.
She's supposed to be dead.
-It's one thing to pull a prank.
-We didn't pull a prank.
-It's another one to hurt someone.
-It was this house.
Shut up!
-George.
-I got this under control.
You don't have you under control.
What you guys did was wrong.
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.
This house is bad, Mommy.
Michael, honey.
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?
-Where did you hear that?
-The babysitter told me...
...that two Iittle boys died
in our room.
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.
Get to bed. We'II deal with this
in the morning.
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.
-Me neither.
-Wipe that stupid Iook off your face...
...and go to bed.
Run.
Why all the yelling, Mommy?
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.
So Jodie hurt her.
-Jodie.
-It's okay, Mommy.
Jodie won't hurt you.
She thinks you're a good mommy.
But the man who Iives here...
...she says he's bad.
She wants him to go away.
He makes her do bad things.
Move it...
...from there to there.
Go.
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.
What?
Is this discipline or torture?
Thought it was meat Ioaf.
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.
It's what my dad taught me.
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?
Billy, why is George such a jerk?
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.
And a weirdo.
And a doofus and a dipstick.
Catch them.
Kill them.
Catch them.
Kill them.
Catch them. Kill them.
Catch them.
Kill them.
Kill them.
-No! No!
-Look at me.
-No!
-What's the matter?
-God!
-It's me.
-It's me.
-God!
Baby, it's all right.
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...
...some serious thought.
Suffer from headaches, nausea?
Actually, I feel great now.
Weird as that may sound.
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.
No sign of any bruising at all.
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.
-Do I Iook nuts to you?
-I'm not trying to offend you here.
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.
I feel Iike it's my fault, George.
-Kath.
-I was the one who wanted this place.
-I put too much pressure on you.
-This is the Iife...
...that I want too, okay?
We got the old American dream here.
Okay? There's no way in hell...
...that I'm Ietting that get away now.
I Iove you, George.
Billy, can I get my teddy?
She's real hungry.
Okay, go. And hurry up.
Mom finds out I Iet you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.
