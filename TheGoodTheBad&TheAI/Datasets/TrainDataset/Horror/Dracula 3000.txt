Now, I want you to try and tell us
everything that happened.
Anything you can remember.
I can't, I can't remember.
We need your help so we can
find the other children.
A house.
- What?
- They took us to a house.
- Who?
- I don't know. People.
Do you think the other children
are still there?
Do you think they've been hurt?
Yes.
You're doing just fine.
We're going to find them.
But we need you to tell us more.
You've got to try and remember.
I can't, I can't remember anything.
Shit!
- Drink it.
- But...
No complaints. Drink.
- Did you get 'em?
- Get what?
The pencils.
Yeah.
Has he had breakfast?
- We're on it. How did it go?
- I'm bushed.
I think it's going to take me a while
to get used to it,
and on top of that,
night shifts.
Don't worry,
you're just starting.
Anyhow I'm going to my father
about getting your shift changed.
We'll see.
Do you know
where the toaster is?
I have no idea.
We still have tons
of boxes left to open.
Unless you give me a hand,
I give up.
Hey, big guy.
Hi.
- Today's your first day, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- You nervous?
- A little.
You'll see that you'll like it.
You'll make lots of friends soon.
Come on, Paul.
You're gonna be late,
come on.
Bye.
It's about time.
I was just about to get you up.
We've got to do.
It's too early.
And I have swim practice.
That's not for two hours.
And travel.
This is the sticks,
I have to take the bus everywhere.
I'm not waiting any longer for this
to start looking like a real house.
We've been here almost three weeks,
and with the notable
exception of myself,
one has unpacked one single box.
And don't forget, you promised you
were going to paint your room.
Mom, I don't...
I don't know if I'm staying.
I thought we discussed this, Reggie.
You know how your father
and I feel.
When have you
ever listened to me?
I just want to finish
school in the States with my friends.
Is that so abnormal?
- Hi.
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
You're crazy.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I'm just here to pick up
my American friend.
Well, you got here too late
'cause I got to go.
Just tell me if you're gonna stay.
I'm not.
- Come on, you got to go.
- Why not?
Go, please.
They saw you.
- We'll talk about it later.
- Promise?
I promise.
I'm warning you,
it's not going to be easy for your
family to live in another country.
Especially for the kids.
Oh, I know. It's a big move.
I'm sure hoping they'll get used to it.
It's a great place.
Think so?
It needs work.
Yeah, That's true.
A hammer and nails and a bit
of paint, you'll see.
Plus I got one month
before semester starts.
Good luck.
Did you meet?
- No. Hi.
- How ya doing?
I was just saying,
it's like a dream come true.
You know what? He's lying.
You don't want to play anymore?
Oh, thanks.
Everybody seems to be having
a good time, right?
Paul reminds me of Mark
when he was that age.
Before...
he left.
Now you'll have your grandchildren
all to yourself
and you're gonna get sick of them.
Yes.
It must be strange for them.
Poor Paul.
He'll end up crazy about you.
You'll see.
I'm gonna get jealous.
It's good to see you, dad.
That's it. It's over.
Finally.
I thought it would never end.
Way to close a party.
Not again.
...experts suggest to be cautious.
Never look directly at the sun,
nor the optlcal device.
So take care, but make sure not to miss
it, Don't forget it's a unique event,
A very special eclipse
that takes place only every 40 years
and there are just 5 days to go.
- You lived here with grandpa?
- Yeah, when I was your age.
That's when you left for the States?
Why did you have to?
Well, your grandparents decided
to split up and...
I didn't have a choice
I had to go.
With your mom?
That's right.
Are you and mom going
- To split up?
- No.
Only families that don't get
along split up.
We get along,
don't we?
Yeah.
It's the second day and I bet
I'm the only one late.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
'We're like the lonely wildebeest
bleating his plaintive poetry
to the infinite herd."
Hey dad, do you even know
what a wildebeest is?
Sure it's...
It's like a cow.
And what's your cow saying?
"Get your ass
out of my face."
"Get your ass
out of my face."
Dad look, it worked.
Dad?
Hey, shithead,
what are you doing? Move it!
Fuck!
Help me!
Help me!
Please!
- When was his last attack?
- More than ten years ago.
Haughtlngton is unpredictable,
but it doesn't have to be serious.
As quickly as it has come,
it can go.
I don't know.
I'm going to give him Haloperidol.
But if he does have an attack,
you know about the risk of choking.
Just keep a close eye on him.
This couldn't come
at a worse time.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Trust me.
Dad.
I'm okay, sweetie.
Nothing's happened.
Come on, let's go inside.
We've still got a lot
of work ahead of us.
This is going to be the best house
in the whole world.
Mom?
What happened?
Your father had a small attack,
but it's nothing,
don't worry.
I've been talking
to your grandfather.
He's got to go back on medication
for a while and that's all.
Mom.
It's starting again.
Nothing is starting again.
This is an isolated incident.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
You remember what happened.
You know exactly what this is.
And just now.
Just now what?
We're completely isolated.
What if something were to happen?
We're ten minutes away from
downtown and I already told you,
nothing's going to happen.
- Mom.
- What?
If you don't like this house
or your family,
then get your things and go.
Isn't that what you wanted, to go?
Well, go on then!
I think we'll survive.
Since the beginning of time,
people considered this phenomenon
in different ways.
But how do eclipses exactly work?
- Feeling better?
- No.
Come on, I fight
with my Mom all the time.
It's normal.
No it's not.
She's never been this cruel before.
I bet she didn't even notice.
- Sometimes people say things that...
- I don't care.
I'm not comfortable.
I don't feel happy in that house.
- Hey there, Tiger.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
Drawing.
You don't play with this anymore.
You used to like it.
Are you going to die?
No.
Listen buddy, what happened
is that your dad...
I got a little too tense
this morning.
Forget about it.
You're not going to let
that worry you, are you?
Come on,
time for bed.
Dad,
don't.
Come on,
lights out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
Dad said I couldn't leave
a light on.
- Since when are you afraid of the dark?
- I'm not.
So?
It's different here the dark.
What do you mean?
It eats my pencils.
Come on, I'll tell you what, how'bout
we make a deal? I'll lie down with you
- Until you fall asleep.
- Promise?
Of course.
Just give me a minute.
Okay.
- I can't find anything wrong.
- There's definitely something wrong.
Maybe you should check again.
I don't know what it could be.
Look, I'll check the sockets.
Where's my drawing pad?
I left it here last night.
- These are kind of wierd drawings.
- They're not wierd.
They're just drawings.
Yeah, but you keep on doing
the same thing.
They're not the same.
They're different.
They look the same to me.
That's because they're all children.
But they're different children.
Paul.
What's this?
Did you hurt yourself?
I don't know.
Has mom seen it?
Yeah. She says I probably did it
in my sleep.
When it was dark.
I'm going.
If you go outside,
don't go near the road. Okay?
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I need to use up the last few frames
on this roll and you will be my model.
I like you as a photographer, but I
think I like you better as a painter.
Oh, Dad, this is Carlos.
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
Do you know anything
about electricity?
No.
Come on.
It doesn't look like mold,
it's more like... rust.
I don't understand.
They painted the whole house
before we moved in.
Trust me, baby,
this is going to look great.
It better.
And I'm gonna go get
some paint thinner, just in case.
If you want,
phone the electric company.
The hell with that, there's
something here that doesn't work.
We've been here for three weeks now,
and every day the lights go out.
They flicker, like the voltage dropped.
Do you understand?
Look, if I were you,
I'd talk to the neighbors.
If it's a supply thing,
they'll have noticed something too.
What neighbors?
We don't have neighbors.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Calm down, okay?
I've done all I can.
In other words, fuck you, right?
In my own house. And to my face.
Fuck you!
Well, you're not getting
a penny from me. Not a goddamn penny.
The insurance company will pay me
either way. Tell it to them.
Not now.
What's wrong?
I'm staying.
I can't leave now.
I'm not going to ask you why.
That's probably a good idea.
What are you doing up?
It's late.
I was waiting up for you.
I'm bushed.
I hope you painted
that room.
I need to talk to you.
Tomorrow. I'm wrecked.
You can't imagine
how busy it's been today.
Why can't wejust talk?
Theres something I need to tell you.
You say not to worry,
but Dad is a bundle of nerves.
You should have seen the way he blew
up at the electrician this morning.
Oh, he's just...
- And like, Paul's not well. I mean...
- Paul's okay.
Look at the drawings.
I mean, does this look like the kind
of thing normal kids do? I mean...
He's a kid. You should have seen
the ones you used to make. Come on.
Don't touch it!
Sorry.
These old things
can be pretty delicate.
What's that?
A room. Hidden behind the wall.
How did you know it was there?
Paul told me.
Hey, check it out.
What about hanging it here?
Fuck!
It works.
That's the beauty
of old things,
no electricity required.
I'll stop it.
No.
And you, little psychic, how did
you know that room was there?
What are you talking about?
- Dad said you told him it was there.
- I didn't say anything. That's a lie.
You want to be a martyr,
fine.
If you keep this up,
I don't know what we'll do.
What's going on?
Nothing. Your brother's gone and
bruised himself again. That's all.
Clumsy.
Who did this to you?
Oh, Reggie. Don't start.
Please, don't get paranoid.
Don't get paranoid?
This has happened twice.
Are you trying to tell me
there's nothing going on?
That's not what I'm saying. All
I'm saying is these things happen.
He's got to be more careful,
that's all.
Mom, why do you refuse to see what
is staring you clearly in the face?
This is not normal.
We'll talk to your grandpa. Maybe
he can talk to Paul. I don't know.
What more
do you want me to do?
I need to get the rust off the floor.
Where did you guys put the matt knife?
I was opening boxes yesterday.
It's gotta be in there somewhere.
I don't understand you.
- Honestly, I don't.
- What's going on here?
Everything's fine. Great.
Couldn't be better,
right, mom?
Fantastic. Maybe you ought
to unpack something.
What's up?
You said you weren't going
to ask me why.
What?
Why I'm staying.
And?
I wanted you to ask me.
My dad's kind of sick.
He has this disease.
It's called
"Haughtington's Syndrome".
Just before Paul
was born it got really bad.
He was having attacks.
But you can't imagine
what it must be like
to be afraid of your own father.
But...
he's okay now.
The treatment took.
He's been fine for years
until now.
Until now?
He's not doing so good.
And there's definitely
something wrong with Paul.
He's woken up
with bruises twice now.
Hold on.
- You don't think?
- I don't think anything.
He's acting weird
and he barely speaks.
Sometimes I think it's that house.
You know, this thing is much
more complicated than it looks.
Where's Paul?
Grandfather came to talk to him.
They're upstairs.
- I'm a mother. Mothers worry.
- Don't worry.
Regina...
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't get to see you.
Hi, grampa.
- You're going to catch a cold.
- Dry off, hon.
Try and get him to stay
for dinner.
Thanks again.
How are you?
I'm good. And Paul?
He's fine.
I'm sure this is no big deal.
The change of houses,
habits, environment.
But he's never been afraid
of the dark before.
I don't think that Paul's fear
of darkness is your biggest concern.
Why would he hurt hinself?
He'sjust trying to call attention.
But Dad's been strange too.
He's worse.
He's aggressive
- Like he used to be.
- That's nonsense, Regina.
I know what you all went through.
And I know it wasn't easy.
But your father
is under control now.
You need to stop worrying.
Nothing is going to happen.
- All right, dear?
- Thanks, granpa.
And now, I'm off.
He says
we shouldn't worry.
Kids do strange things sometimes.
We have to find a place
to hang that picture.
I don't know...
Mark, please.
We're talking
about our children.
They're going through a rough time.
Reggie...
she's at a difficult age.
Maybe we're not being understanding
enough with her.
And what about me?
Who's being understanding with me?
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, please.
You don't think
I hear the little secret conversations
that go on behind my back?
You're losing it.
Right. Exactly. That's exactly
the attitude I'm talking about.
Thank you.
I know where they get it from now.
Mark, please, calm down.
Did you take your medication?
Mark!
Mark?
Mark!
Regina!
Mom?
Reggie, quickly!
Come over here.
I'm feeling kinda woozy.
Slow breaths, okay?
Hold it.
I have to get the alcohol.
Not now!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Where's the fuse box?
In the laundry room.
Reggie!
Paul?
Paul, what's the matter?
Let me in.
They won't let me.
- There's someone here.
- Paul, let me in.
I can't.
- Paul!
- Dad!
Shut up!
You're scaring him!
I said, stop it! Dad!
Open this door right now!
Mom!
- Stop it!
- Shut up!
Let me go!
Stop!
Paul, honey, come here.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I don't know.
I got scared.
We couldn't open the door.
Baby,
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong with you?
I'm here now. It's okay.
It's all over.
It's not all over.
They never go away.
They only hide.
Who? What are you talking about?
The kids.
What kids?
The ones in my room.
They wouldn't let me out.
They hate me.
They say I'm an impostor.
Paul,
there's no one else here.
Just you and me,
and mom and dad.
Those kids don't exist.
You're imagining them.
Yes they do.
They come out when it's dark.
They live in the dark.
Didn't you hear them?
Didn't you?
- Hello.
- Carlos?
- Reggie, is it late?
- I know. I know, I'm sorry.
I need your help.
What's wrong?
It's this house.
Nobody has ever lived
in your house before.
The guy who sold the house
to your father
doesn't even exist.
Neither does the real estate agent
or the lawyer.
And the phone number that's on the
contract has never been in service.
So there's nothing we can check?
Maybe. I found some information
about the architect.
Great.
Excellent. Wanna help me?
Where's Regina?
She left at the crack of dawn.
I don't know.
