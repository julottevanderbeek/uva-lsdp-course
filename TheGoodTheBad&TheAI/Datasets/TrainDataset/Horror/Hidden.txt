GIRL:
WOMAN:
GIRL:
ZoZo, what are you doing under here?
ZOE: Mom, I told you, I don't like
that stupid baby name anymore.
My name's Zoe.
And I'm under here because I'm hiding.
Olive said we had to hide.
She dreamed they found us.
Who did?
- The Breathers.
- Hey, what did we just talk about?
Our new rule, remember?
Rule number four. We're not allowed
to talk about them anymore.
I didn't. Olive did.
CLAIRE:
Well, you can tell Olive that no one found us.
Dad's been keeping watch all night,
just like always. We're safe here.
ZOE:
You hear that, Olive?
OLIVE :
- Her smile is stuck.
That means she doesn't want
to be smiling anymore.
That means she's still scared.
Would it make Olive feel better
if we went and checked with Dad?
It's okay.
All right.
Come on.
It's okay.
ZOE:
Mom, look.
CLAIRE: That's just Dad.
- It doesn't look like Dad.
RAY: Oh. Someone had another nightmare?
ZOE: Dad.
Hey, hey.
- Thought we told those nightmares to go away.
- We did.
- Well, then why are you so scared?
- Better ask Olive about that.
RAY:
Oh, was it Olive this time, huh?
How does she even sleep
with her eyes open all the time?
- Dad, don't be mean.
- I was just wondering.
- She wants a report.
- Well, then I better consult my notes.
My glasses, please.
Thank you.
So my watch started at 10.
At 2, I played seven games of solitaire.
Won four, lost three.
Lost four, won three.
Ms. Zoe, you see right through me.
At 5, a couple of deer ran overhead.
And at 6 in the morning,
I heard little footsteps.
Possibly belonging
to my rascal of a daughter. Hmm?
But other than that, nothing,
not a creature was stirring, not even...
- A Breather?
CLAIRE: ZoZo.
No, not even a...
- you know.
- And the locks?
- They still hold fast?
- Do you wanna check?
- Can I?
- No.
Ray, I told you I don't want
her going up there anymore.
What? This little monkey?
She can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it, Mom.
I know the rules.
One: never be loud.
- I know you know the rules.
- Two: Never lose control.
Three: Never open the door.
Four: Never talk about the Breathers.
- Careful, ZoZo, your shoe.
- I got it, Mom.
RAY:
Hold fast?
ZOE:
Hold fast.
ZOE:
Can't I just go barefoot?
No, that wouldn't be right.
Why not?
Because we're not animals, Zoe.
I need you to remember that.
But it's not like I'm going outside
or anything.
Well, who needs to go outside
when we brought the sun with us?
Another beautiful day, huh?
Mm-hm.
You wanna make it official?
Not too hard, okay?
I don't want you to slip.
ZOE:
I got it, Mom.
RAY:
- How many days is that?
CLAIRE: If you don't remember, just count them.
They're lined up in rows of 25.
And there are how many rows?
ZOE:
One, two, three, eight, nine. Twelve.
CLAIRE:
So 25 times 12 makes?
Three hundred plus the one I just marked.
So 301.
That's it. See?
Those math lessons are really paying off.
OLIVE :
- That means she's hungry.
Let's see here. We've got hominy...
corn, potatoes, beans.
- And peaches.
- Peaches. Definitely peaches.
You know, we had peaches yesterday.
We can have them again tomorrow.
But I was thinking today, maybe we should
try something with a little protein.
- Maybe beans for once.
- Ew, beans are the worst.
- Dad. Beans or peaches?
RAY: Yeah?
Uh, I don't know.
-  Peaches.
- Peaches sound pretty good to me.
CLAIRE:
Ray.
- Uh, how about we take a vote?
- Ray.
All those in favor of beans,
please raise your hand.
One vote for beans. Now, all those in favor
of deliciously sweet peaches, raise your hand.
Sorry, hon. Two against one.
Three.
- Is Darlene acting up again?
- No, she's a tough gal.
She just needs a little encouragement,
that's all.
There we go. Told you she was tough.
Mom. Dad. The peaches are gone.
CLAIRE: Not funny, ZoZo.
- I'm serious. Someone stole them.
God. That's 12. That's 12 cans.
That's almost two weeks of rations.
There are no more peaches?
Uh, no. No more peaches.
Something must've been drawn to the sugar.
Something with teeth.
What has teeth like that?
A rat, probably.
But a rat couldn't get in here.
I checked the door. It's hold fast.
The door is not the only way in.
Can the Breathers get in there too?
- ZoZo.
- Can they?
No, they're too big to fit in there.
But a rat could.
CLAIRE:
If it's a rat, it's still in here somewhere.
We have to keep an eye out.
We have to find it
before it steals any more food.
In the meantime,
we'll have to cut down on our rations.
Dad, they're already so small.
I'm sorry, Zoe.
I really am.
I'm not gonna ask you again. Eat.
- Mom, I told you, I don't want stupid beans.
- Hey, remember rule number two.
Never lose control.
- Never let anger take over.
- Rule number five: Never call me ZoZo.
- I just wanted some peaches.
- A thief stole them.
And now we're all gonna have
to give some things up.
I already have nothing.
I'm stuck in here. I can't even go outside.
I don't have any friends except Olive
and she can only say five things.
RAY: What about us?
- What?
Well, you said you don't have any friends.
What about us?
Mom and I aren't your friends?
- You know what I mean.
RAY: No, actually, I don't.
I think it's silly to say you don't have anything
when you really have everything.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right. Look at that.
- How many days did you say that was?
- Three hundred and one.
Three hundred and one.
We shouldn't have been around
for any one of those days.
But just when we needed it...
we found this shelter...
and it's given us food, a home, a life.
And for all we know, we could be
the only ones left, the only ones still alive.
So every one of those marks
is really a miracle.
- A miracle?
- That's right. A miracle.
And this food is gonna allow you
to live another day.
And that means another hatch
can be drawn, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
So you see those nasty cold mushy beans
on your plate?
They're really their own kind of miracle too.
And if you eat your mushy miracles for us...
then maybe we can take a trip afterwards.
- A trip? Really?
- Really.
But you better eat fast, because I finished
my miracle beans and I want more.
ZOE:
Careful with it, Dad.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
ZOE: That goes there. Joey's house goes there.
- All right. Off we go.
ZOE:
Eight.
Five, six, seven. Sylvia's Ice Cream.
Okay. Let me get the door.
Door's open.
The chimes ring above you.
And, look, there's Sylvia
standing behind the counter.
And she's wearing
that silly cone-shaped apron.
Good morning, little Zoe.
And she hands you
one of those little pink plastic spoons.
And you run your other hand
along that cold glass countertop.
Inside, you see barrels and barrels
of Sylvia's fresh homemade ice cream.
But now it's still early,
so she's got all the best flavors.
Salted Honey. Peanut Butter Brittle Crunch.
And of course, your favorite.
- Strawberry Shortcake.
- Ha, ha.
Are you there?
You happy now?
Till tomorrow.
Till tomorrow.
ZOE:
You win.
I win.
- Aha. I win.
RAY: Everything's gonna work out.
CLAIRE:
I'm trying to believe that, Ray. I really am.
But imaginary ice cream
isn't gonna feed our daughter.
ZOE: Told you.
RAY: Just trying to keep her spirits up.
CLAIRE: And you are.
But what happens when she gets sick?
We've lost a lot of weight already,
all of us, and now...
And now we're just gonna have to find
a way to get more food.
Real food.
I'll go to the damn surface if I have to.
You can't, Ray.
- They're still looking for us.
- Yeah, well, I can fight them.
That's suicide, and you know it.
Do you remember our promise
when we first got here?
Zoe comes first. No matter the cost.
- The important thing is we haven't been found.
- Except by a rat.
But only by a rat.
Oh, honey.
Try changing your point of view.
This shelter can be a prison
or it can be a home.
- Beans can be beans or they can be...
- Miracle beans.
- Why not?
- Because I'm not 9 years old, Ray.
I get what you're trying to do for ZoZo.
But I don't believe in miracles.
- Not anymore.
- Well, you should.
This is our life now,
and we have to live it the best we can.
Or else what's the point?
- The point is to stay alive.
- And we can do that...
and still live.
Hmm?
CLAIRE: Ray?
- Huh?
What are you doing?
Living.
CLAIRE: Well, we gotta be real quiet.
- Relax.
I'll see you tonight.
Have fun.
Mom! Mom! Please!
CLAIRE:
Zoe!
ZOE:
Mom! Dad! They're coming!
CLAIRE:
Oh. That's a doozy. A five and a two.
- So five divided by two is...
- Two and a half.
Bingo. You can move your car now.
Come on. Thought this would be
a fun change of pace.
It's still boring math, Mom.
Even with Kingsville.
Well, if it's so boring,
how come Olive's still smiling?
That's her fake smile.
That's why she looks a little... You know.
- Creepy?
- Ah!
I didn't mean that, honey.
She just needs a bath. That's all.
How about we have
another go around the board...
and then we take a break, okay?
Okay.
Mom? Do you think Dad's right?
- Right about what?
- You know...
about the three of us
being the only ones left?
- The periscope?
- That's right.
- What do you want me to do with it?
- What do you think?
I want you to look up there.
- On the surface?
- Mm-hm.
I thought you said I wasn't allowed to do
that, ever, ever, ever, or I'd be dead meat.
Yeah, well, I'm trying something new today.
What?
Relaxing.
So, what do you see?
Nothing. The school. Playground.
Nothing.
Dad's right. It's just us left.
- Us and Olive.
- But do you see us and Olive?
- No, Mom.
- Do you see the shelter door?
- I can't see the door. It's covered.
- Exactly.
When we first came down here, Dad and I
made sure to hide the door, remember?
So that no one could ever find us.
- So?
- So...
sometimes, just because you can't see
something doesn't mean it's not there.
Sometimes the truth's hidden from us.
Do you think our friends
could really be out there?
They're just hidden like us?
They could. They'd have to be.
Because the Breathers
would be hunting them?
ZoZo.
Yeah, the Breathers
would be hunting them too.
They hate us a lot, don't they?
To keep hunting us like that?
I don't know that it's hate. It's just...
They're different than we are.
And that makes them as scared of us
as we are of them.
- Because of what happened that day?
- Yeah. Because of what happened.
- You said Breathers.
- I know.
The thief.
He's back.
RAY:
Don't look.
Hey.
What's wrong?
It's the thief.
That son of a bitch.
I'll kill it. Just stay back
in case it makes a run for it.
No, no, you stay back.
I'll kill it.
- No, I'll kill it.
- We can't all kill it, guys.
You remember that Thanksgiving
at Aunt Cathy's a couple years ago?
With that insane possum
in the backyard?
Who took care of that thing?
- After Dad kills it, can we eat it for dinner?
- ZoZo, quiet.
- Get it, Dad.
- Unh. Shit.
- Dad!
RAY: Aah!
ZOE: It's getting away! Hurry!
- I know.
ZOE:
Dad!
Mom!
Wow.
That was awesome.
Even more awesome
than when Dad killed the possum?
Definitely.
What is that?
Get back, get back.
- Aah!
- Turn it. Turn it off, Dad.
It's gonna break. Get back. Get back!
- It's burning Kingsville.
- We'll put it out. Just stay here.
Stay here.
Not again.
CLAIRE:
Come on, Ray!
Ray! Help me!
- Don't break her!
- Darlene can take it!
Ray, come on!
I told you she was tough!
All right, move back, move back!
ZoZo! I told you to stay back!
RAY:
I can't see a damn thing.
CLAIRE:
Hold on.
Where's ZoZo?
RAY: Zoe?
CLAIRE: ZoZo?
ZoZo? ZoZo.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Did the fire burn you?
- I'm just scared.
RAY: Well, there's nothing
to be scared of anymore. We put the fire out.
Nobody's hurt. Look, even Olive's okay.
Just a little dirty, that's all. See?
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- No, Dad. It's not.
It's not gonna be okay.
They're gonna see.
Who?
The Breathers.
My God.
- Mm. Hello, bacon.
- Ha, ha.
- Where'd your little sous chef run off to?
- Upstairs getting ready.
Still? How long does it take
to put on a swimsuit?
A long time when you're trying
to impress Joey.
- Joey?
CLAIRE: Yeah, he's coming along with us.
Joey Neary, next door?
- He's a real cutie, don't you think?
- I think he can barely tie his own shoes.
That's what I think. Joey Neary.
Come on, you remember young love,
don't you?
Yeah, well, I had definitely outgrown
Nerf weapons by our first date.
- I don't like this at all.
- Dad. Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?
- That Joey's going on vacation.
- We were supposed to play Marco Polo.
- That can't be true. I talked to Jillian.
TED:
Just leave it. We don't need it.
JILLIAN: We have to go. Come on.
TED: Leave everything there.
We got what we need.
Come on.
RAY: Hey, Ted.
TED: That's good.
CLAIRE: Jillian?
TED: What else?
- Ted, is everything okay?
- Jillian.
- Hey, Joey. What's going on?
- I don't wanna leave.
- Why do you have to leave?
JOEY: The government man.
He said the virus, it changes people bad.
- What kind of virus?
- Come on. We have to go.
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, no time.
- What's happening?
- Just get Zoe and get as far away as you can.
- Come on, let's go!
- Tell Zoe I'm sorry I can't play Marco Polo.
RAY:
Ted.
Where's everyone going?
MAN:
I got that. I'll get it. Don't worry.
Just pack that up. I'll be right back.
The Breathers.
They're gonna see it, aren't they?
Aren't they?
Well, it's sundown.
So maybe it's too dark to see the smoke.
Maybe.
Can you see any smoke?
Don't forget rule two, Claire.
We have to stay calm.
- Have to stay under control.
- I have to think.
Anyone within a mile of here
will have seen that smoke.
The Breathers are gonna come for us.
I know it.
- Let Mom and I talk, okay?
- They're gonna find us.
- Just like Olive dreamed.
- They're not.
- They might.
- Stop.
Stop? I'm trying to figure out what to do.
We're not gonna do anything.
Even if they see the smoke...
and I don't think they will,
by time they get here, it'll be gone.
- They'll have no idea where it came from.
- They'll know we're here.
- They'll search the area for us.
- So let them come.
They've searched here a dozen times before.
They've never found us.
- And they're not gonna find us now.
- Dad's right. We're still hidden.
I checked. Remember?
All agreed we're safe,
please raise your hand.
- Two against one.
- Three.
What's wrong, Mom?
- The Wood's burned.
- So?
So burned wood makes ash.
We're not hidden anymore, are we?
- I don't think they'll notice.
- You really wanna take that risk?
- I don't have another choice.
- We cover the ash.
How?
We'd have to go onto the surface.
But what about the third rule?
Never, ever, open the door.
Sometimes rules, even Mom Rules,
have to be broken.
Listen to me. If you hear anything
up there, anything but me and Dad...
- I want you to lock the door behind us.
- What?
No, I'm going up there with you,
I'm gonna help.
- Out of the question, ZoZo.
- It's Zoe.
- Stop treating me like a baby.
- I'm protecting you.
But what if you need me to protect you?
I can fight if I have to.
No, you can't. My rules still apply to you.
So no matter what happens up there,
no matter what you hear, do not open the door.
- But...
- I need you to promise me that.
Promise.
Promise.
We have to move fast. I don't wanna be
up there for more than three minutes.
Three minutes.
Okay.
They're going this way, Olive. Come on.
No. I don't know where they went.
It's just them, Olive. They're okay.
Mom! Dad! Look out behind you!
Mom! Dad! Hurry!
Dad!
Mom! Dad!
Dad!
Mom!
Dad!
Aah!
What the hell are you doing?
I told you to stay inside.
- I saw...
- Slow down. We can't understand you.
Breathers.
Watch out!
It's just deer, Zoe.
Nothing to be scared of.
Just Bambi.
- They looked scared.
- No, don't be silly.
She's right, Ray. They're running away.
Running away from something.
We have to get back in the shelter.
RAY:
Careful.
- What happened? Did you see something?
- Quiet, quiet.
What is it, Dad?
Footsteps.
- I think it's just one.
- Why just one?
They've always traveled
in groups before.
I don't know.
Maybe he's the only one
who saw the smoke.
He's headed this way.
ZoZo, we have to stay quiet.
Rule number one, remember?
Never be loud.
- I know. I'm trying.
- Try harder.
If he hears us, he will find us, understand?
- Do you understand me?
RAY: Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.
Zoe, come here.
Have a seat.
What do you say we get out of here?
Because look what I found.
With this car...
you can go anywhere you want.
Anywhere in the world.
Any time.
- Where do you wanna go?
- My bed.
- Yeah.
- My old bed.
Yeah.
That's an excellent choice. Okay. Okay.
You collapse on your bed.
Exhausted after a long day.
And you pull those warm pink polka-dot sheets
all the way up to your eyes.
And you hug all your stuffed animals.
Puffy Bear, Duck Duck, Cathypillar.
Kissing them good night.
And you can feel the fan on your nightstand
blowing a soft breeze through your hair.
And then you look up
at the ceiling above you...
where we hung
those glow-in-the-dark stars...
and they shine for you.
So there's always light.
Even when you sleep.
Even when you dream.
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm there.
Can you see the stars?
ZOE:
Let it go, let it go.
OLIVE :
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, baby. You're gonna be okay.
He can get here, can't he?
Hold fast, right, Dad?
He's too strong!
We need something to brace the door.
- Something tough.
- Go! Go!
- You can't go up there!
- Tell Dad to hurry!
- Dad, hurry!
- I am hurrying!
- Mom? Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Just stay down there.
Dad, hurry!
CLAIRE:
Ray!
- He's almost through!
RAY: Hold on!
ZOE: Dad!
RAY: Watch out!
- Give me the pipe!
- Wedge it under the handle!
Watch out, Mom!
Watch out, Claire! Die! Die!
CLAIRE:
Ray!
Ray! Ray! Ray!
Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!
He's not getting in. It'll hold.
It will. Okay? Okay.
Hold fast?
Hold fast.
He's still up there. Why isn't he leaving?
Why won't he just go away?
I don't know.
He's up to something.
CLAIRE:
What could he be up to?
Why's he still standing there?
That's what he's doing.
- He's waiting.
- Waiting for what?
The rest of them.
Hey, look, there it is.
The water tower over there.
Do you see it?
- Once we're past that, we're out of Kingsville.
- ZOE: Then we'll be safe?
- Safe from the sick people?
- That's right, sweetie. Safe from the sick people.
- Why are all those people headed back?
- I don't know.
I thought you said we couldn't stay,
that it was dangerous.
Maybe everything's okay now.
- You think that's possible?
- I don't know.
Gotta be able to get something.
Maybe A.M.?
Ray, watch out!
MAN : All civilians in
Kingsville must return to their homes at once...
This is a quarantine order
signed by Governor Schroeder...
under emergency code 11.
This is for your own safety.
Repeat, all civilians in Kingsville
must return to their homes at once...
This is a quarantine order
signed by Governor Schroeder...
under emergency code 11.
This is for your own safety.
Um, what's a quarantine?
Quarantine.
It means they're not letting us out.
You mean we're trapped in here?
MAN: The CDC is working closely with the
National Guard to support the deployment...
Dad, they're here.
Darlene's not gonna hold.
We need something else.
- Aah!
- Run!
- Get Zoe to the bedroom. Go!
- Hold on!
That's not gonna last long.
Ray. Help me!
CLAIRE: Hold long is that gonna last?
RAY: A couple minutes.
- Gotta get out!
- They're blocking the door.
Mom, Dad.
The door's not the only way out.
RAY:
The periscope.
- We can fit.
- I don't know about you.
I'll be fine.
Okay, Ray. It's clear. Get ZoZo.
- You ready?
CLAIRE: Get ZoZo!
- Come on.
- Ray, now.
- Okay, watch your head.
ZOE: No.
RAY: You got her?
CLAIRE: Got her!
Okay, she's up. Come on.
I can't fit.
I can't fit.
Oh, come on.
Drop it! Hold tight!
- Oh, God.
- Dad? Dad! Dad!
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Ray!
- Remember our promise.
Zoe comes first.
Come on. Come on!
CLAIRE:
Ray! Ray!
ZOE:
No, Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
ZOE:
Daddy! Aah!
- No! No! Dad! Let me go!
- There's nothing we can do.
- We can help him!
- I promised him that I'd protect you!
- I promised him that I'd protect you!
- I don't care!
- I promised him!
- I hate you! I hate you!
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- Let me go.
It's okay.
- We have to run.
ZOE: What?
Run!
- Olive! Olive!
- ZoZo! Come back!
Run!
CLAIRE: Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Come on. Come on.
ZOE:
Where are we?
CLAIRE:
Where it all started.
- What do we do?
- Run! Keep running!
The Breathers. They're coming!
She dreamed they found us.
They're still looking for us.
They hate us a lot, don't they?
To keep hunting us like that.
CLAIRE: They've always traveled in groups.
RAY: Well, I can fight them.
CLAIRE: That's suicide.
ZOE: What's a quarantine?
RAY: It means they're not letting us out.
- The Breathers.
CLAIRE: Let us go!
ZOE: Aah!
Let us go! Let us go!
MAN: Test them.
CLAIRE: Let us go! Let us out!
Mom, it's an earthquake.
No, sweetie, it can't be.
Kingsville doesn't have earthquakes.
Why the hell does the CDC
need military jets?
They're turning around.
They just told everyone
to go back into town.
Mom, Dad, they're coming.
MAN 1:
Come on! We gotta get out of here!
MAN 2:
No, no, no! It's too far to walk there!
- Kingsville Elementary! There's a shelter.
- What?
- I don't know if it's safe.
- Well, it's safer than here.
Come on!
- We gotta go, guys.
- Come on. Come on.
- Where is it?
- There!
- Where's the door?
- There.
ZOE: They're coming! Hurry!
CLAIRE: Ray! Hurry!
RAY:
Let's go. Come on. I got you now.
Claire, come on. Come on!
Claire!
RAY:
Are you okay? Claire, are you okay?
CLAIRE:
Yeah, I'm okay.
- You guys?
ZOE: Yeah.
RAY:
Yeah. Yeah, we're... We're okay.
We're okay.
Oh, they have everything here.
Oh, look at all this food.
Hey, Zoe.
Look at all this.
Huh?
There's...
- There's books and games and...
- Hey, Dad?
More toys, that... Yeah?
How long do we have to stay here?
I don't know.
Not... Hopefully not very long.
We just gotta wait
till they clear this up. And then...
Honey...
what happened up there was a mistake.
It was a terrible, terrible mistake.
CLAIRE:
It wasn't a mistake.
The shelter door, it cut me.
The virus must have gone airborne.
