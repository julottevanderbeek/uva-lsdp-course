Dear Mum, Get well soon.
Tell the head nurse to stay.
Ryoko, Ryoko...
Ryoko, Ryoko
Hello!
I'm sorry,
I brought this for Mum.
Hey, let's go home.
The waves are too high.
Dad, no luck again?
You don't understand.
I'm only after the big ones.
I prefer real life girls
to imaginary big fish.
Well...
When you grow up,
you'll understand.
It's called romanticism.
Yes, well...
I have done the planning.
I'll bring it tomorrow.
Yes... Hello
Sorry I have to go.
This is too big for us.
We'll share it with Rie.
You don't bring friends home
anymore. Is everything OK?
Did you know that black
sea bream originate as males?
What?
When they reach 15cm long,
they become unisex.
Then some become female.
-Oh really?
What about this one?
We saw ovaries.
Did we?
I don't know very much
about ovaries.
You don't look young anymore.
What?
-You look very plain.
Gang.
Hey Dad, why don't you
get remarried?
Why do you say that?
I just simply think so.
Thanks for the dinner.
It's your turn for the dishes.
It's like a ceremony for worshipers.
They're pretty much the same,
lonely.
Happy people wouldn't
go to that kind of concert.
The whole of Japan's lonely.
Are you?
You too, right?
Boss.
Ueno wants to change tomorrows
meeting from 1 to 3.30pm.
That doesn't matter to me.
I'll be here.
I'll drop in at Starts and
then meet Yoshikawa tonight.
I won't be back at the office.
Any changes and I'll call
you on your mobile.
Yeah.
Well...
I'm going to marry soon.
Really?
Congratulations.
To whom?
Someone you don't know.
Congratulations anyway.
You're a busy man!
-It's alright but...
The profit margins are
getting thinner.
How about you?
Don't you know?
The movie industry is profitable.
-Really?
I'm lying.
It's like a survival game,
or a game of torture.
Is it no good?
-Seems like a bright future ahead.
But I don't know
how long we should wait.
Yoshikawa. Didn't you say
the same thing a year ago?
Did l?
Awful girls.
No class and stuck up.
Stupid as well.
Where are all the good girls?
Japan is finished.
Let me say...
I intend to get married again.
Well, what made you
decide to do that?
Which one?
-I haven't got one yet.
My son said to me that I look old
and I should get married again.
That's the story.
You look old...
How are you going to look for one?
An arranged marriage?
No, that's not my style.
I wish there was a very nice
woman hiding somewhere.
What kind of female are you
looking for? Preferably young?
Not too young?
She could possibly have a
job, and some training.
Training?
For instance, playing the
piano, singing or dancing.
You ex-wife Ryoko
was like that.
Certain training gives people
confidence.
A lack of confidence brings
unhappiness.
Pianist.
It'll cost you more.
She need not necessarily be
a professional.
I don't want to fail at
marriage at my age.
I'd like to have enough time
to observe her.
I'd like to see many women
then choose my ideal one.
What are you laughing at?
Am I expecting too much?
I probably am.
-No, I can handle that.
I have an idea.
Have an audition.
It'll be a romantic story.
Remember your documentary?
Love triangle between dancer,
patron and a Down syndrome boy.
Teamed up with a German TV station.
I'll rearrange the story.
Any problems?
I don't see any problems, but
we're going to audition?
Trust me.
Have I ever disappointed you?
Well no, but...
The heroine is supposed to be
in her early 20's to 30.
The conditions are that she be a well
trained person. No problems, huh?
Wouldn't it be fraudulent?
This audition is not only about finding
you a wife. It's part of making a movie.
If we collect enough capital,
we can make the movie.
The story isn't bad.
Well...
Am I supposed to marry
the main girl?
No, a girl with that much talent
wouldn't marry you.
They aren't the marrying type.
Really good ones will always
fail the second interview.
Really?
-Those are about 1% of all applicants.
They are quite attractive.
Smart, with a good upbringing.
Traditional and well trained.
Wishing her to be your
son's wife?
I don't get it.
Why can't she get the main part?
They are not unhappy.
Happy people can't act well.
And another thing. I have a plan to
work with FM, I'll combine this.
Make another program
called "Tomorrow's heroine".
Trust me.
I'm a pro at auditions.
This is Yoshikawa. I'm in
room number 2. Coffee?
Is coffee OK for you?
Bring two coffees please.
I'm in a middle of a traffic
jam, I might be late...
Please hand that tape to
Mr. Kaneda.
Thanks.
Tomorrow's heroine
I'm just wondering
where you are?
Wonderful things might happen. If you
encourage yourself a little bit more.
Every star has their defining moment.
Hepburn and Julia Roberts.
They led their own lives
prior to becoming heroines.
Tomorrow's heroine is living
at the same time as you are.
No, tomorrow's heroine could
be you yourself.
I'm home.
Here we go.
-You're home early.
That's right, I've got to
work at home tonight.
Please heat up your dinner.
The bigger dish is for Shigeto.
Thanks.
-See You on Monday.
My daughters here this weekend.
I've got to go shopping.
That's nice.
Hey Gang.
Please put your washing in the basket.
-Right.
Thanks
-Bye.
Hello.
-It's me.
Yoshikawa. I'm
checking the applications.
They're all good, right?
I don't know what am I
supposed to do?
It's like buying my
first car.
Don't mix your car and wife.
I intend holding the audition
next week. Choose 30 applicants.
-That's right.
Alright. I'll let you know.
-Don't trust pictures.
Composition can be more useful.
-Understood.
See you.
-Bye.
Choose 30 from all of you?
You're home?
Why don't you knock at
the door? You just arrived?
Yeah. Dinner?
-I'll eat later. Why don't you eat first?
Alright.
I'm having a guest tonight.
Girl friend?
Give her my dinner.
Thank you.
What did I do!
Asami Yamazaki.
Classical Ballet for 12 years.
I'm not sure that I can make an actress of
myself. And you probably won't choose me.
I was simply attracted to this story.
I studied ballet, but damaged
my hips when I was 1 8.
I was devastated as I intended
to practice in London.
Ballet was my priority.
So my dream collapsed.
It might sound exaggerated,
but it's like accepting death.
Living is another way of
reaching death.
I think I know these facts very well.
That's why I applied for this part.
When was this dinosaur living?
-about the latter Cretaceous period.
The later part of Cretaceous
means...
That's a Sauropod right?
Good. What about the dinosaur
that has the Syracuse model.
I don't know.
-Do You want to see?
Hi! Good evening.
-Good evening.
I'm his father.
My name is Misuzu. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet You too.
I often see her on the train. I thought
she was pretty. Then tried talking to her.
Good job.
I'm interested in biology.
He showed me his books.
We ate your dinner.
-Fine.
Was it his?
I'm sorry I ate your meal.
Terribly sorry.
I will cook something for you.
-Don't worry about it. Take it easy.
Gang.
Good boy.
Let's go for a walk.
Shigehiko, make sure she gets
home alright. -Of course.
OK boy, come on.
Let's go Gang.
Ready?
Well... I feel like a criminal.
I'm ready.
Let's start.
Pleased to meet you.
Please sit.
My name is Yu Tanaka.
Please have a seat. Are you nervous?
-a little bit.
Sorry, you are the first one.
-That's OK.
We're going to tape you.
But don't worry. -OK.
Do you mind if I ask what
your father's job is?
Well... my father's...
job is...
What can I say?
Next one.
I'm going to ask you frankly.
Why did you apply this part?
Have you ever had sex with
someone you don't like?
Are you interested in drugs?
Can you act a little bit for us?
Sure.
-Go ahead.
What music do you like?
Which actress do you like?
-I like Mituko Mori.
Next.
I used to love sports.
At school, I played...
Did you ever want to work
for the sex industry?
I have a friend who is
working in that area.
Next.
What are men to you?
Have you ever seen Tarkovsky movies?
Ren Osugi.
We have some sex scenes. Can you
handle that? -No problem.
Are you psychic?
Next.
May I ask you a question?
Can you smile?
What kind of men
don't you like?
Yoko Sugimura.
Nice to meet you.
If I didn't have confidence
I wouldn't be an actress.
Excuse me.
When I was 2, mother decided
that I'd be an actress.
Can you walk around the chair?
Turn around.
Next please.
Nice meeting you.
It's time for a break
from our schedule.
We're 30 minutes late.
Let's take a 1 0 min. break.
Sure.
You don't seem too enthusiastic.
Don't tell me you're
not interested anymore.
It's not like that.
Like what?
I'm nervous myself.
I need to use the toilet.
I lived in Paris for 3 years. And have
come back to Tokyo as a designer.
I can't think about anything
else but being an actress.
My office was only for adult videos.
-Keep her for another job.
I'm not satisfied being
called a cover girl queen.
This scar is from my 1st suicide
attempt and this is from the 2nd.
I've been to an asylum 3 times.
Next.
Emi Kitani.
Pleased to meet you.
We finished your
interview before.
But I haven't finished
what I have to say.
You have nice career, why
do you want to be an actress?
I think I've been doing
very well, but...
Sorry.
I'm a children's nurse.
My work is very hard...
Next please.
Ms. Asami Yamasaki.
Please.
Asami Yamasaki.
-Have a seat
Sorry for the delay.
-It's OK.
Have you done any movies
or TV jobs?
I've had many opportunities,
but actually haven't done any.
Do you belong to any agency?
Not really.
But I'm on keep
for a record Co. director.
But we haven't contacted
each other recently.
Which record company?
-Ace Records.
Could you tell me your
personal contact's name?
Japanese music dept.
Director Shibata.
Since you quit your previous
job, you're unemployed?
How do you manage your daily expenses?
lf you don't mind telling us.
I help at a friend's shop. 3 times a week.
-What kind of shop?
A small bar in Ginza.
The owner used to be a class
mate in voice training.
If I keep my costs low,
I have no money problems.
Don't you want to lead
a luxurious life.
Too poor isn't good.
But I can afford books and CDs.
That's enough for me.
Can I ask you about ballet?
Certainly.
You damaged your hips.
-That's correct.
It must have been awful to
quit what you'd been doing.
Yes.
I must sound a bit rude but...
Your writing says that quitting
what you liked...
...is almost similar to accepting death.
I was highly impressed.
I think everybody has
similar experiences.
In your lifetime when you have
something beyond your control.
What can you do but accept it?
I think that's life.
I mean...
I was amazed a young girl
like you understands that.
I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way.
That's what I thought.
Thank you very much.
Are you finished?
Thank you for coming.
We may contact you later.
-Yes.
Excuse me.
May I call the next one?
-Let's have a 1 5 min break.
Fine.
Please tell Mr. Ito I'll be late.
What do you think?
-She made me very nervous.
I wanted a cigarette.
You decided on her before
the audition.
I like her much more than
her nice writing.
I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way.
It's not an interviewer's
comment. I was stunned.
Don't joke about that.
She really impressed me.
I'm sure she's a serious
type of girl.
She is better than her photo
and may also be good hearted.
But I don't like her.
What's wrong with her?
Something chemical.
Can't say exactly what's wrong.
I just don't like her.
Misuzu?
She looked nice, but...
-What?
One of those girl things.
I don't understand girls. Do you?
Thanks.
Hey dad, about your remarriage. Preferably
someone who cooks better than Rie.
Why are you in such a hurry?
New discovery of another
dinosaur, from Argentina.
That one could be older
than Euraptile. Really.
I'll be busy collecting
information.
Take a bath.
Yes, hello.
Sorry for calling so late.
This is producer Aoyama.
I interviewed you today.
Thank you for your time today.
-Not at all. Well...
I wondered if you might have
some time to talk with me.
Of course. I'd love to see you.
When would suit you?
-Anytime would be fine, during the daytime.
Really. Let me see.
For instance...
Good night.
This is the Aoyama residence.
It's me.
-How is it?
About Ms. Yamasaki.
Without suspicion,
I called Ace Records.
It's no big deal, but
something didn't seem right.
What is it?
Director Shibata isn't
at the company.
To be precise,
he isn't there anymore.
He's been missing for a year.
He just disappeared.
I'm nervous.
Please relax, I won't ask
you any special questions.
You only ask of me to enjoy
this nice food and talk?
Absolutely.
That's the best request
I've ever had.
Just one question.
Your director contact.
Mr. Shibata?
I'm sorry I said so at the
audition but...
In fact I've never met him.
I don't belong to
any actors agency.
I was advised to answer you like that.
Is that so?
I didn't mean to tell a lie.
It's OK. I've clarified that
question, that's no problem.
Here we go.
Looks wonderful.
Go ahead.
Yummy.
-Good.
I hope I'm not asking you
too much but...
If you have some free time,
I'd like to talk to you more.
I don't have anybody to be
frank with.
If I'm good enough,
I'd love to.
Really? I'm very happy
about that.
I'll try not to bother you.
I don't mind any place.
Even on the telephone
would be fine.
I'll write my mobile number
on my busniss card.
Please call me anytime.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the meal too.
I've decided.
I don't care about the movie,
I'm interested only in her.
Don't worry about the movie.
I'll handle that matter.
But don't be too hasty.
You wanted to have some time
to observe your prospect.
Why are you so negative about
her? What's wrong with her?
I only think that life
isn't so easy.
She is beautiful, classy
and obedient.
Such a woman not having any
boyfriends is unthinkable.
I checked out her associates,
none are accessible.
The bar she was talking about
is also an unknown.
We can't reach anybody
who knows her.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I won't be fooled this easily.
I trust myself over some
others evaluation.
If there's any trouble, I
can solve it.
OK.
You said I could find my
ideal woman from an audition.
I appreciate it.
Hey Aoyama.
Promise me one thing.
Don't call her.
Hopefully it's my miscalculation.
It's going to effect your
whole life.
Don't be so hasty.
Cool down a bit.
Alright. I promise you.
You're not sick are you?
It is rare for you to
take a day off.
Since I've worked for you,
I've never seen you like this.
Oh well...
It's good to have a break.
You might be a little tired.
Since your wife died, you've
worked very hard for your son.
Forming your own company which is
doing quite well. You work too much.
I wish my husband was like you.
My life would be easier.
You must have a nice
girlfriend.
I'm sure you do.
Men can't maintain without
female support.
I've finished.
I'm going home.
Bye.
-See You tomorrow.
I'm leaving.
See you.
Do you have something
to tell me?
Not really.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Hello... This is Aoyama.
Really? Good.
I thought you wouldn't
phone me anymore.
