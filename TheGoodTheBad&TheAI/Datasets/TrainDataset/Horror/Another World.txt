Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha
-Some say it was all
caused by a virus.
And truthfully, it's
much more logical than
some apocalyptic event of
biblical proportions.
A virus sounds more likely.
Something tiny, invisible.
Carried within us.
A collection of molecules,
a set of commands,
fragments of microscopic codes
that float wherever there is life,
waiting to attach themselves
to any living creature.
And to unleash their
malicious program upon on it.
Yes. A Virus sounds to me a
much more likely call.
The first day and God
said, "Let there be
light!" And there was light.
Genesis 1:3.
-You can help instead
of just sitting there!
-Are there any more?
-There are only a few seconds. Run!
-Are the drill charges ready?
Well, what are you
waiting for? Work your magic.
-Are you sure you want to
forget about the doctor thing?
--If someone's badly hurt
he dies. If someone
contacts the disease
that requires medical
attention he dies.
-We don't need a doctor.
-We don't need a doctor,
but we want one.
-Why take the risk?
-You want them.
You think a doctor
can give you more
information. Forget about it!
It's a waste of time.
All that's left is
to keep moving and attacking.
As fast and as fierce  as possible until
they die from lack of food and water
and become extinct.
-Information Is power.
We need the information so that the
initiative remains in our hands.
-Not that kind of information.
-What about hiding in some remote desert
until this whole thing blows over?
In the desert, we'll  need
a medical expert for sure.
Trust my my calculations. All we
need is two trucks loaded with...
-It's too dangerous!
they can always turn up when we're least
prepared and then we'll be trapped.
-That's not true. Come
on, remember when we met
after everything fell apart?
-You were sitting on your ass
waiting for a sonic boom and
a down poor of nuclear
warheads to cleanse the place.
-Only if they're bombers.
I told you.
If they're ICBMs
or cruise missiles,
You wouldn't have heard a
thing before the explosion.
But we digress.
Look, at one point or another
we'll need to settle in
one spot and we'll need
someone with medical know-how.
-When settling in one spot is an option,
perhaps. But until then,
my way is the only way.
Keep moving keep attacking.
And we say when, where and how.
That's not the issue, is it?
You're simply dying of curiosity.
But curiosity will get you killed.
-So I'm curious, so what?
I don't get you.
Aren't you even a bit curious?
You wake up one day and everyone
around you has turned into mindless,
bloodthirsty,
pissed off zombies,
and you do not want to
know how or why it happen?
-No, I don't.
-Besides, I need to renew
my chemical stock.
Not to mention it's my turn
to choose our next destination.
A deployment location where
we can prepare for an ambush.
Agreed.
A Hospital. You choose the one.
-Come on!
Come on!
-Abracadabra.
Let there be light!
Let's go.
Do you know your way around the hospital?
-Yes.
-Room 318, Ward C. Go there.
Lock yourselves in
and wait. -Go!
-How unlucky can we get?
we come looking for a doctor, and we find a
nurse and a girl instead.
-My sister isn't a nurse
Sheâ€™s a senior doctor.
And I'm not just some girl...
-You've revealed too many details to two
complete strangers
before we've even
asked the questions.
There's no time for this.
We have to get out of here.
- It's okay. it's okay.
It's one of ours.
We've booby-trapped the entire place.
That's not right.
-I suggest whoever is standing
behind that door, you better move
before I blow this door to bits.
-Should we run? Before it?
-No time. Turn over the bed!
-I'm coming in, don't shoot.
Now, get up now.
You're the one who
set up that nice little
kill-zone out there.
Nice, very nice. Now
all you have to do
is just stand there and
pull your trigger.
-What do you want?
-What do I want? What I want ?!
Look at this. Look at this!
They got me. I'm infected. You get that?
I'm fucking infected! Now what I want
is for you to take this thing out of me.
I want a cure. Do you understand? A cure!
And you're going to give it to me.
You out of all people!
I knew you'd come here eventually.
You and your kind.
Now, what I want is for
you to take this thing out of me!
-Do you know him?
-You can say we know each other.
All my life I've been
hunted down by his kind.
What are you? A General?
No, you're too young for that.
Maybe a captain? Or Major?
Ah, you're a colonel.
Yeah, You must be a colonel.
-He's right about one thing. Part of my job
was to hunt down  freaks like him.
So yeah, you could say we know each other.
-Don't patronize me!
You're not in the position to patronize me!
I'm holding the cards now.
They can't see me, I'm infected.
That means that I'm invisible!
Truly invisible! So you better
come up with something quick.
You better come up with
something or else...
-To the exit now!
-Do you know him or not?
-Not personally.
-Should have killed him
when we had the chance.
You let him out of the room.
You pitied him?
'Cause if you did,
that is the first time
you let the emotion
get the better of you.
- It doesn't matter, he's dead.
And you have your doctor.
-I know you were a soldier.
An Officer. I guessed it.
It must be hard aiming
down and shooting at someone.
-Npt infected, I mean.
On second thought,
he said he was.
Do you understand what he meant by that?
-Forget it! He's dead!
-And you better stop
asking questions before you expose more
details to two
complete strangers.
-So, You're a doctor,
I'm sure you understand these
things better than us.
What do you think he meant
that he is not infected?
I mean, someone who's
infected person turns into...
I mean you know, how can he be infected
and still control himself?
It has an incubation period.
Ok.
How dis he get
infected in the first place?
He had to be infected by one of them.
I mean
those wounds didn't look deep
enough to be animal bites.
You'd think that...
-Let it go.
There'll be time enough for your questions
-Must be almost nine o'clock.
If you turn the radio to...
- That's right. We almost
forgot it's almost nine.
You listen to him too? -Yeah, of course.
Every day at nine.
Do you think that it's him talking
or a recording? -I do not know.
Someone broadcasted it.
-Must be...Manually
operated radio broadcast
or a pre recorded program
that comes on every day at nine.
-Hey, you are worrying me.
I'm supposed to be the
cynical one, the skeptic.
But not without feelings. You're the son of
a bitch, remember? The purposeful one?
Who Lacks emotion, stays on the move and...
-Come on, let's go,
it's probably already started.
Perhaps it came with the rodents.
Small, elusive, merciless.
Spreading disease and death.
At times eating the remnants of the strong,
other times preying the weak.
They're merging from
the dens of night,
it's raiding dinosaur nests.
devouring their eggs, systematically
destroying the mighty creatures.
Perhaps that's the
nature of progress,
the new devouring the old.
Tears him to thousands
of tiny pieces until it perishes.
Perhaps progress is in it's
essence a type of extinction.
Unavoidable like the time in
death, but accompanying it.
The second day
And God called the firmament Heaven
-Step into my office.
-Remind me what are
we doing here exactly.
-We are setting up
traps for the kill zones.
Then there lure
infected and we butcher them.
I know it sounds
absurd at first.
Our initial instinct is
to entrench ourselves
in one spot. Or if you do not want to get
trapped, simply run away
or stay out of trouble. But...
-No, I mean, I get that part.
We're in charge, we
chase them, not the other way around,
what I mean is what are we doing here
with all of this water and...
Electrodes? -Electrodes. Well, we are
dividing the waters from the waters
and making a firmament
That we will call heaven.
It's...it's electrolysis. It's
breaking down water
into hydrogen and oxygen.
I'm hoping to create
a large enough amount
of hydrogen in a closed space
so that at any given
moment only a small spark and...
everything explodes. Everything.
In theory, of course.
Truth is, I've tried several times
and it didn't go so well...I guess I
couldn't create a large enough
amount of hydrogen
in the closed space
to get a substantial blast.
I don't know, maybe I didn't
seal the spaces well enough...
or maybe I haven't had enough
containers with electrodes, but...
Whatever the reason,
we're doing it now.
-It's beautiful.
-Thanks. I'm glad  someone
appreciates my originality.
Not him, though. TNT and gunpowder,
it's all it cares about.
I mean the metaphor. It's like God.
Turning water into the heavens.
-That?
That's not original.
This religious fanatic
joined one of the forums
I've managed once. Some scientist
or pseudo scientist. I don't know.
The kind that tries to explain
the scriptures through science? You know?
Anyways, he raised the  theory that this
is how God created the heavens.
By transmitting an electric current through
the prehistoric waters.
It's a good theory, but I
didn't let him off that easy.
I asked him "Hey, where
did the nitrogen and the air come from"?
Still waiting for an answer.
-Where the nitrogen came from or
how the heavens were created?
-Yeah.
-Do you like it?
-What's it for?
-You sound just like my father.
Why does everything have
to have a purpose?
Why can't we do things
just for the sake of doing them?
Do you like it or not?
-Aesthetically yes, but...
-But it serves no purpose, right?
-Say, don't you think beauty
has a purpose of its own?
That it can exist just for
the sake of...well... beauty?
Can't we do things for no reason at all?
Say, eat something
because it tastes good
or hear music?
Or draw a picture just for fun?
Alright, If you're done, let's go
and watch you learn about the rifle.
I can't believe you.
You're just like him.
Purpose, purpose, purpose.
There can be beauty
in purpose and function too, you know?
I mean, look how...
-They are entering fucking building!
Follow me.
Go, go, go.
One entry, weapons that way.
We need to leave!
-Negative. Outside they can close
in on us from all directions.
Here, there's only
two directions.
And according to you the
rescueâ€™s on the way.
As soon as it arrives, we'll make
a run for it and get out of here.
Grenada.
The rescue's here! Move!
-Get in!
-Go, go!
This is the second time they'd attacked
us instead of us waiting for them.
Something is not right.
-It doesn't mean anything's wrong, either.
What is wrong is for
The third time we've been attacked
from the direction you've been observing.
And instead of working
on her SHOOTING skills,
you're playing the alchemists.
You still owe mean answer.
-I answered you.
From what I've seen with my own eyes.
the time between an infection and
outbreak shifts from a
few seconds to several minutes.
But I've only seen a few cases,
so I can only go by that.
-It's the same as I've
seen up until now.
And that's what I read in the official
reports before everything fell apart.
But that guy at the hospital...
- We have no reason to believe
he was actually infected.
-I don't know. It's hard to explain,
but I feel like he wasn't lying.
We don't know what this thing is
and we don't know how it's transmitted
from one person to another,
and we don't know
who and what he is.
In any case, I'm not the right person
for this discussion.
As far as I'm concerned, it's over.
But if you insist, you got him.
Now, if you do not mind,
I have more important matters to attend to.
Take a quick break.
Drink some water,
straight back.
-Purpose, purpose, purpose.
I swear you he's just like dad.
-You're right, but he's not.
Don't fall into that trap.
-Are you sure it's not too soon?
You fired more weapons
on the range than most
recruits on do during
weeks of basic training.
The sooner you get
used to killing,
the sooner that we'll get
this thing over with.
-How long will this have to go on?
How long do we have to make traps and
wait around with guns and kill?
-Just a few more months, sweetheart.
I promise, in a few
months this nightmare will be over.
And we'll find
a quiet spot where we can put all these
horrible things behind us. Ok?
-We almost always make traps.
Stand by with weapons, wait.
It's never really over.
There are merely rest nights, that's all.
-You don't really believe that?
That's a strange way of looking
at things: through a rifle sight,
with no hope for
something better? Something else?
-It worked! The vapor bomb; it worked!
You should have seen it.
The moment we went up we were
bombarded with cloud of steam.
They were totally blinded!
You should have seen it. All
water turned into steam
inside the container and...
-A few charges would have
done the job. Probably even better.
-Then maybe that's how the heavens
were created. A huge heat
source boiled the water...
But it's only steam. -OK, Ok, Ok.
If the temperature high enough,
and AI mean really high, the water
disintegrates into it's elements, but...
-But now the chemistry lesson is over
and we have real work to do!
-Are there any more?
-It is possible they
killed each other.
The predatory dinosaurs simply
disobeyed the laws of balance.
Just like man.
Perhaps one or several dinosaurs
become so skilled at killing
that they eradicated entire species.
I know it doesn't sound likely,
after all, the ecosystem
was supposed to intervene.
The more the population
of prey decreases,
the smaller the
populations of predators
becomes. Allowing prey
to recover, and so forth.
The only exception into
this equation is man.
But how do we know
man is the only one?
-The third day
God called the dry land Earth
-Before all of this began,
I used to watched these scenes for hours
to observe the basic power
of the creation of
matter from nothing.
There is no greater truth than that.
-We're out of here.
-Did you pick anything up
since everything went quiet?
-No.
Just the guy with
the dinosaurs, that's it.
Do you think there is still
a government out there?
-There Is always something.
That's what civilization
is all about, isn't it?
Someone tells others what to do,
gives them orders and in return,
lives at their expense. It's false.
-And by your definition, if
there is no government,
then there is no civilization.
-I don't know. If there were a
functioning government,
they'd probably cleanse the entire area
with nuclear weapons.
and we wouldn't be here.
And maybe it'll still happen. Who knows?
-Well, in that case, we won't
know anything until it's over.
-Oh, that all depends.
If their ICBM's are a cruise
missiles, you won't hear a thing.
But if they're airplanes,
then you have two options.
subsonic bombers like
the B-52s and you might
just hear the jet
airplanes approaching
right before the blast. Or
supersonic bomber like the B-1
and then you will not hear
anything because well,
they're supersonic. But you
might just hear a sonic
boom right before it all
comes crashing down.
And there'll be this
bright light and this intense heat
And then you won't  hear a thing.
-You're smiling.
This is the first time
I see you smiling.
Finally,  someone else he can
drive crazy  with this conspiracy theories.
Did you tell her what you
did before all this began? -No.
-He had a website where
he refuted conspiracy theories.
Now he's the  greatest believer of all.
-occam's razor.
It's usually the most simple,
most logical explanation of all.
Think about it.
Why did all the functioning
governments disappear all of a sudden?
Why is there still electricity
and running water?
You tell me. It must be
biological weapons.
I believe that.
It's the most logical,
most simple explanation.
Your turn to stand guard.
-What did you lose?
-More Than enough.
You?
-I was on the offensive.
You never sit back and
rest?-Always.
It's all right.
I understand if you don't
want to talk about it.
-Everybody.
Everything.
As bad as it gets.
-Husband? Parents? Kids?
-Cousins, uncles...
As I said,
The worst.
-It's always gonna be worse.
-I see. Look, I know
everything looks dark,
I understand your point of
view, but things change.
-Not for me!
Most of my life I have killed
and witnessed killing.
I have been responsible for the
planning and development
of ways and
methods of destruction
that will be
incomprehensible to
a person like you.
So, as far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed!
-But surely not like this.
Not women and children.
Not your own family.
Look, my entire life
I've seen people
die suffering from all
sorts of illnesses.
But at the same time, I've
seen others who healed
and grew as people because
of that suffering.
So you're right. Nothing's changed.
That's exactly my point.
I know that even now there is hope.
-We shot four of the five who were
in pursuit but there is still more.
-This is the third time.
This is not an accident,
someone's leading them to us.
-Tonight's hideout. Move!
-I'm beginning to think that it's
that the guy from the hospital.
After all, he survived
all of our traps.
And he said something
about them not seeing him.
Could be they're not
attacking him for some reason,
just like they
don't attack one another.
What do you think?
-He could be guiding them to
us and then running away.
It is not unlikely.
Devise a plan. If he really
is leading the infected to us,
we'll have to neutralize him.
It's eleven o'clock and
we missed the broadcast.
It's the first time I'm
missing the broadcast.
So, you think they do know each other?
-I do not know.
It's not so clear cut.
-You said for a fact
that he should have
killed them at the
hospital, but he didn't.
That's not like him.
I mean, I don't know him very well,
but that's not like him at all.
-I know, I've never seen
him hesitate like that.
But then again, I've never seen
him with a live person before.
I mean a healthy person.
I mean, not infected.
Look, he's obviously a
professional soldier.
Could be that shooting citizens in
back is just against his basic nature.
You know, the ethos of the
honorable warrior and all that.
It actually it fits in
well with his type.
I've got to say
that that's exactly
what I assumed when
I first met him.
Way too young to be
General, too confident and
experienced to be Major
or captain. I don't know.
But we should probably
get back to the others.
they're probably beefing
up security as we speak.
If someone really is leading
the infected to us,
we should probably set up
as many charges as we can.
We are out of hiding places.
-What is this?
-it's a little
experiment I'm conducting.
I'm creating land from water.
See, the cage is
in a body of water
and I'm running a fake
current through it.
The current makes the particles
inside the water
stick to the cage.
According to the theory, enough particles
should stick to it
over time to create
small islands where you see the cage.
-We should probably go back.
-Yeah.
Yes, we should. -This
Is really nice.
Thanks, thanks.
If he's really following us,
he's familiar with this place.
That means he'll will guiding
the infected to us tonight or tomorrow.
Do you have a plan?
-I always have a plan.
-That's how you put
up with me, isn't it?
Maybe you enjoy me driving you crazy.
I should have
known. Like always,
you are hunting me down. Like
a cat playing with a mouse!
-Don't move. Don't move.
I get it now. They think they
should be afraid of me.
Hate me. Me!
He's the one you
should be afraid of!
He's the one who killed
his entire family!
Tell them, Colonel.
Tell them who you really are!
Don't move! -I suggest you stand
still and raise your hands.
-All of them!
With his own gun! From point blank!
His mother, his children,
his little niece.
A two-year old baby.
Clever. They absolutely aren't.
You kill one person as a civilian ,
you're a criminal. A murderer.
You kill one person while
wear a uniform and you're a hero.
A civilian killing twenty
is a psychopath.
A serial killer.
-But a soldier, he gets a medal!
-Stop it!
-And if by any chance
you're responsible
for the deaths of hundreds
or thousands or more,
You're a national hero.
Kill millions you're a god.
There are poems about you!
You've become the stuff of legends!
Stop, I beg you.
-They are afraid of me.
They despise me.
When all this began, he still had
soldiers under him.
He could have helped
his family to solitary,
take care of them. Help them out!
At most send one of his troops
to take them out of their misery!
But no, no! not him! he went by himself!
To put a bullet in each
and every one of them.
Right in the head.
execution style. So here he is!
A decorated hero!
A noble man of honor!
Nothing but a psychopath
in the service of the law!
Nothing more!
His mother, his children!
From point blank!
Tell them, Colonel. How does it
feel murdering your whole family?
-No! What the fuck ?!
You could have waited a little longer,
it looked like he had information.
You could have waited.
-I've seen it before.
He was about to die.
And you?
Did you know him or not?
Why'd hesitate again instead
of just killing him?
Why'd you hesitate this time?
-What's the difference?
He's dead.
Another attack.
Take up your positions!
-A meteor, yes.
After all, what can cause such
sudden extinction other than some
external element coming out of
nowhere obliterating everything?
Like a Hollywood disaster
movie or an apocalyptic myth.
Or is it no more than a reflection of one
of our greatest fears?
The total lack of control
over our fate?
Who knows that whatever we do
at any given moment,
the end is lurking.
Absolute and final gigantic,
burning, unstoppable.
Of course, there is the
possibility they did see it,
but simply never
understand what it was.
Perhaps it's before our
own eyes as we speak, and
like the dinosaurs we can't
see or hear it.
Like an annoying beep that your brain
simply wipes off after a while.
-The fifth day. And God created
great whales, and every
living creature that moveth.
-So,did you know him or not?
-When I told you to
prepare the hideout, I
asked you to kill the
fish in the aquarium.
They attract cats, and if they die
they will attract worse than that.
-You didn't answer my question.
-The time and energy you spent on that
automatic nourishing device,
we don't have time for that.
-Did you know him or not?
-I told you; I didn't know him personally
and he is dead. So it doesn't matter.
-And the truth doesn't matter?
You're hiding something from us.
You know how all this
started, how it all began, You know...
You know how all of this is started...
-What difference does it make?
What I told you or didnâ€™t
tell you is nothing
you couldn't have figured
out for yourself.
Yes, it was biological
weapons experiment.
Yes it got out of hand.
Yes.
-So you knew. This entire time
you knew and you didn't tell us?
You knew how all
this happened and...
-in the same way you knew.
I don't understand why
you're feigning innocence.
Didn't you ever stop to think
why the infected don't attack one another?
Why they only attack the healthy?
You ? With all the
conspiracy theories?
Wasn't it obvious to
you from the start
that the most
logical explanation
Is a biological weapons
experiment that got out of hand?
I mean, what would it achieve,
for me to tell you something
you already knew?
She's a scientist.
It's your obsessive curiosity
that got us here in the first place.
If it wasn't for the geeky obsessions
of people like you with the truth, and how
and the why, we wouldn't
be here right now.
-Look, I understand
your anger, but...
Just like he sat at his computer
developing software viruses.
His friends and colleagues
were developing things
that were much, much worse.
And he could easily be one of them.
If you care so much about the truth,
don't lie to yourself. We're all sons
of bitches, that's the truth.
So don't play innocent
as you didn't know,
just because I hid or didn't hide
something from you.
I don't have time for
this ridiculous discussion.
We have a large explosives
arena to prepare by noon.
In the last few days,
we've burned our traps faster
than we could build them.
We have to close the gap.
Now, don't fool yourselves.
It won't get any better.
The infected are getting more
and more violent and aggressive.
If we stop dictating
the time and place,
they're gonna kill us all.
now get some rest.
We'll take lower floors
when we are rested.
Don't judge him too harshly.
You heard what happened.
He had to kill his
own family by himself.
You didn't just lost everything.
I used to have this argument
with my father about euthanasia.
Would I have the courage to do it?
If and when?
-Don't fall into that trap.
He's not Dad, remember?
-Let's go.
-Tadpoles?
It's amazing, even the frogs
will fuck and spawn here/
-Hey, hey, hey
mate and procreate, please.
-So you're saying if we find
some random fish
from an abandoned pet store
and put it together they'll
mate and procreate?
-Absolutely. But we
really shouldn't because
they tend to electrocute
the place,at some point.
-Yeah, but...we will have a chance
to make some love before it's all over.
-Now I understand why you do not like
talk about it.
I'm sorry.
Your wife, children?
-Parents, siblings,
a niece, everything.
Everyone. With my sidearm
at point-blank just like the man said.
-The worst.
I'm sorry.
-There is always something worse.
I treated a terminal patient
once who applied fora court order to
switch him off her life support machine.
You know, to allow her to die in dignity.
When the order came in,
the woman insisted
that only her youngest
daughter would actually do it
You know, to actually
pull out the plug.
That girl lived on
the other side of the world.
It took him a whole
week to trace her
and another week
to finally arrive.
All through that time, the mother
suffered through hell.
We begged her to end it,
but she insisted on waiting.
After the girl arrived
and everything was over,
I had a chance to
speak with her.
When she spoke of her mother, she
spoke of a cold and harsh woman.
Somebody who is always criticizing
demanding.
never caressing, accepting comforting.
But she said she would forgiven
everything if her mother
had just told her once
that she loved her.
At that point I stopped
her and I said,
"You mother didn't
just say she loved you,
she screamed it out loud
halfway across the world."
-Ten minute break then prepare
the charges we're not keeping up.
This can't go on;
we must keep up.
-I wish we were on the beach.
-I'm not the beach type of guy.
That's because you didn't
know my dad.
One week with him and you would
totally become sea god.
He was really a pirate deep inside.
At least a professional fisherman.
He always talked about a Viking
burial ceremony at sea. -Viking burial.
So what? Lying in a boat,
sailing off into
the horizon with
all his favorite weapons
and worldly possessions?
-And the fire slowly consuming it all.
Not bad.
-I don't know. I'd rather die
while making love.
-Is this the first time you've scratched
or bitten by an infected person?
-What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.
I'm talking about scratches
you got on the corridor.
-You don't miss a trick, do you?
-Not when it comes to injuries.
That's what I do for a living, remember?
And you didn't answer my question.
-It's happened before.
-Yeah, to me, too.
Right at the beginning, but then
then it wasn't contagious or
it wasn't transmitted through bites
or scratches. Or maybe the
incubation period was very long.
Anyway, we have to find out.
Maybe it's growing inside of us and
we must stay away from them
for their  safety before
it breaks out while they're around us.
-What makes you think I know ?
-Come on.
There's no point in
carrying on the charade.
It's alright, I won't tell them.
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.
It can't be a coincidence.
That's all right. I know
exactly how you feel.
Everything is collapsing around me, too.
All this is new to me. unlike
anything I've seen and maybe...
-Maybe you need to
get a grip. Because like I said,
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed.
-You're doing it again.
Attacking instead of answering.
and  I refuse to play the game.
I know some things haven't changed,
you're right, but there are wounds.
-There are wounds that no one
can heal. Not a doctor,
Not a healer, not time, no one.
We've rested
enough ; we're leaving.
-Promise me?
Promise me that when all this is over
We can...
try to grow some fish without
having to electrocute them?
-And...tridents
... and salamanders.
and... -Frogs?
Frogs.
-Anything you want.
-Come on, start making the charges.
Use them.We already know how
to use use small arms.
It's time you learn how
to prepare charges and
handle the explosives.
-Another answer is
volcanic eruptions.
Not a single event
but thousands of small ones.
pressure accumulated from millions of years
and then one day, everything is released.
The huge force erupts in numerous places,
filling the atmosphere with
dust and lethal gases.
Blocking the sun,
poisoning the soil,
the air and the water.
What's more frightening than the thought of
destruction lurking under our feet?
Coming from the same
the place we live off.
From which we draw our comfort
in life and death?
-I did it. It worked!
I've been trying
this for months; it's perfect!
Even he can say it's ineffective.
I mean, look. It's...it's small,
It's got a remote control,
it's got a camera.
it's the perfect patrol device.
It's perfect.
-Nothing you can't do with a camera
installed in a remote controlled vehicle.
-I knew you'd say that, but mind
can climb and descend stairs. Take a look.
Check it out.
I don't get it, it just worked.
-Don't worry, don't give up.
You know, one of my
professor of medicine
used to joke and say that
in the book of Genesis
There's actually two versions
creation of man.
Because you know, the first one didn't
work out so well, so God tried again.
-Well, from what I can see, He didn't
do a better job the second time.
I guess he released the beta version
too early before fixing all the bugs.
-The beta version?
-Yeah, the beta version.
You know, like
computer programs;
they release versions
without fixing mistakes.
-By no means whatsoever.
I see he managed
to convince you, but
believe me, it's too soon.
in a few weeks maybe, when we
are certain everyone's dead, but not now.
-We talked about loading up several
tons of equipment and foods on trucks
And drive them down to a remote
location in the desert. Somewhere isolated.
Hundreds of kilometers away from
any town and to laying low for a while.
-I'm all for it. I mean, look,
I devised a plan and I even made a list
on how to collect everything.
And there's also room.
-It's still too soon.
-I agree. There is no
place they can't reach.
And then we have nowhere
to run and nowhere to hide.
-Wow, you finished it!
-Yeah.
-It's beautiful!
-Thanks. Look, this...this
is the cage and protects processing unit.
I think I'm going to
build another one and
I'm going to make a
communication system
between them. Then I'll
replicate them and
we'll be able to point
them everywhere.
You know, get one-one man shifts.
They'll rest a little more and...
-And we'll have more worthless toys.
And time wasted on maintenance and repairs.
Ok, fifteen minutes'
rest and then we leave.
I'll stand guard
while you get ready.
-Look, why were you
so hard on him?
Is that what you
consider life's purpose?
Always on the go? Kill or be killed?
-They're coming!
-They're coming. We're surrounded.
This is it, we're trapped. -Fuck this!
let's hide in the corner.
They'll break in, we'll finish them off.
We have enough charges and ammunition,
-Negative. There's too many
of them. This must be the end.
They become especially aggressive
and frenetic just before the end.
They can smell and hear from
hundreds of yards away.
Gather within seconds.
If we went in a corridor,
a narrow killing zone perhaps,
but this way, they'll reach us long before
we can do any serious damage.
-Her love. That's what you are.
Always remember that.
Love.
There is nothing else, understand?
-There's always hope.
You just need to take a good look around.
-Wait, wait. If they all
enter the hall all at once,
We simultaneously blow off the charges.
stay close to the ceiling.
-Yeah, perhaps.
It might buy us several minutes before
next wave. We've got nothing to lose.
They'll  help you deploy the charges,
I'll take care of the rest.
-Come on! -Detonators.
I'm right behind you!
Go!
-Come on!
Come on!
-Move! Move! Move!
-She's not going to make it! Come on!
They're going to kill her!
Let me to do it!
No!
Come on!
-Not yet! Not yet!
-No!
No!
-It's time to go to the desert.
-Leave me.
I'm dead.
Go.
Good luck.
Why didnâ€™t you leave there?
I am a dead man. We all are.
-You're badly hurt, but it's not over yet.
She's dead, but you're still alive.
-So you're doing this for her? For
the idiot, that fucking hypocrite.
-Shut your mouth. You hear me?
-You're not...
-I'm not what?
Jesus Christ! I'm sick and tired
of the pretense and the hypocrisy!
What do you think? What was
she thinking? What are all thinking?
that if you help your fellow
man and simply live and do no wrong,
That absolves you from
any responsibility
for what goes on around you?
The essence of life
is murder and suffering.
Every time you eat
to sustain yourself,
you're feeding off the death
of a living creature.
-Plants and animals aren't like that.
-Plants, animals?
Every time you turn on the
light or drive a car,
someone somewhere
dies of lung cancer.
Every time you
buy something  for peanuts,
some kid dies in a
third world sweat shop. -It's enough.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're delirious.
- Jesus.
Again with the denial.
You know I'm dead,
but you think like her.
That if you treat me,
maybe ease my pain,
It'll make you a better person.
Love, grace, pity.
Fuck you! You're doing it for yourself.
You're just like her.
On the run and killing
in an attempt to live
and not to be killed.
No more, no less
a murder than the rest of us.
You can say anything you want about me, but
don't you dare say anything about her.
-Don't dare?
Don't dare ?!
Let me tell you something about that bitch.
Why do you think I chose her hospital
out of all the hospitals? Huh? Why?
Because it was part of the program.
It was a research hospital
that was part of the program.
I hoped there would
be research subjects there.
I was curious. Curious to know
how my project turned out.
-No, I don't believe you.
I don't . -You knew all along.
All this time you knew.
-Oh, yeah. I knew.
And what that little shit said when
she blew his brains out is true.
I am God. I'm God!
What was the idiot
thinking when she killed it?
That she'd spare him the pain? That she's
keeping me from confronting the truth?
That ignorant, phony moron.
I know the truth!
I know who I and what I am!
I have come up with
the idea for the experiment,
for Christs sake!
I set up the meetings.
I wrote the memos, I pushed,
pressured, persuaded, hinted,
contrived, falsified signatures.
The head hunches never
would have approved it if
someone like me hadnâ€™t
been pulling the strings.
This was my baby!
The highlight of my career!
The entire damned,
monstrosity of an experiment!
It couldn't have been worse.
I killed them. All of them.
I didn't just pull the trigger,
I eliminated all of them.
We're all murderers. I'm just a little
more successful than most, that's all.
But your sister, a saint,
sheer perfection,
worked at a hospital that took
part in an experiment. -No.
I don't believe you. She would
never have... -Never have what?
Stupid bitch. She lived,
therefore was a murderer!
You want to save me. You can't.
I'm dead. The infected didn't attack me.
I contracted it, too.
Right from the start.
And it has no cure. I know because
I made sure there wouldn't be one!
It's Ok. You're sick,
it all makes sense.
-We're all sick. We live,
therefore, we're sick!
Life is a disease!
We're all murderers. You and him.
And your sister and your father.
See...
You want to...
We want to... -do
this properly.
We clean him up and dress him.
And we'll  put him in a boat like a
Viking noble, by the book.
We'll find two
trucks, and load them up
everything  we need and
we'll drive to the desert.
-It is possible that no
one theory is incorrect.
And maybe they all are.
Perhaps it was not just one event and the
end never came from a single source.
but a combination of factors,
some related and some not.
Something damaged the fragile balance
of the dinosaur ecosystem.
Maybe the dinosaurs themselves.
Maybe small rodents. In any case,
just then when they were most vulnerable,
a large meteor struck Earth.
causing a chain of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions throughout the world.
-A Meteor, eruptions,
earthquakes, imbalance.
Each of these itself
was not enough.
But together, they caused
everything to collapse.
And some say it was
all caused by a virus.
The truth is this sounds much more logical.
The end
