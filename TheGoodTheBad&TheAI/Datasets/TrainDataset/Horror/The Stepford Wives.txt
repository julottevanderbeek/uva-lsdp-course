AH, HERE'S MOMMY.
HI, MOM.
HERE WE GO.
FAR AWAY.
OH, MY.
GONNA MISS YOU.
THERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
TAKE CARE, MRS. EBERHART.
BE HAPPY.
THANK YOU, CHARLEY.
COME BACK AND SEE US.
GOOD-BYE, KIDS.
SEE YA.
LET ME TAKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE CARE OF HIM, WILL YOU ?
HE'S UPSET.
NOW, HANG ON TO HIM TIGHT
SO HE DOESN'T JUMP
OUT THE WINDOW.
THERE YOU ARE, MR. EBERHART.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
THERE YOU GO.
THANKS A LOT.
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.
ALL RIGHT.
BYE !
THAT'S A TERRIFIC JOB
YOU DID UP THERE.
I'M SORRY.  I THOUGHT
I CHECKED EVERYTHING.
DADDY ?
HUH ?
I JUST SAW A MAN
CARRYING A NAKED LADY.
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE'RE MOVING TO STEPFORD.
COME ON, FRED !
COME ON, KIMMY !
COME ON, FRED !
HEY, THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO LOCK THE DOORS
IN STEPFORD.
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT ?
YEAH.
UPSTAIRS IN
THE MAIN BEDROOM.
UPSTAIRS ?  TERRIFIC.
TURN AROUND.
YEAH.
COFFEE ?
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRINK
ANYTHING ON THE JOB, LADY,
EXCEPT BEER.
COME HERE, FRED.
YOU WANT A LITTLE WATER ?
HUH ?  THAT A BOY.
I'M CAROL VAN SANT.
I, UH-- I JUST THOUGHT
THIS MIGHT COME IN HANDY.
IT'S A CASSEROLE.
OH, WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S REALLY
VERY NICE OF YOU.
UH, I'M-I'M WALTER EBERHART.
MY WIFE'S JUST INSIDE.
I KNOW SHE'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.
OH, NO, I KNOW
HOW MUCH FUN MOVING IS.
I JUST LIVE OVER THERE.
OH, AND TELL YOUR WIFE
YOU KEEP THAT
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.
BYE, NOW.
THANK YOU.
SHE COOKS AS GOOD
AS SHE LOOKS, TED.
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE HERE ?
THAT WAS A GOOD CASSEROLE
SHE COOKED.
WHY DID WE MOVE ?
WE BOTH AGREED IT WAS BEST.
I MEAN, IT'S BEST FOR THE KIDS,
AND, UH,
IT'S BEST FOR YOU.
I MEAN, YOU GOT MORE SPACE HERE.
YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF
A DARKROOM.
AND BECAUSE IT'S SAFE...
AND BECAUSE, UH,
I CAN WARM MY ASS
BY A REAL FIRE.
THOSE ARE ALL
TERRIFIC REASONS.
YOU, UH, EVER MAKE IT
IN FRONT OF A LOG FIRE ?
- NOT WITH YOU.
- WELL, IT COMES WITH THE HOUSE.
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL.
NOW, I ALSO DO
THE "NOTES ON NEWCOMERS" COLUMN
FOR THE
YOU'VE GOT THE COPY
I LEFT IN THE MAILBOX ?
YES, THANK YOU.
THEN YOU KNOW MY STYLE.
IT'S MAINLY FOR LADIES.
SO YOU JUST GO RIGHT AHEAD
AND TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING MUCH
TO TELL, REALLY.
UH, WHAT DOES YOUR HUSBAND DO ?
- HE'S A LAWYER.
- LAWYER.
ME, I'M A...
SORT OF HOPEFUL, WOULD-BE,
SEMIPROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL
MISS MOST ABOUT NEW YORK ?
OH--
NOISE.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE GUY WAS,
BUT I'M ASSUMING IT WAS
MR. VAN SANT.
WELL, WHAT TIME WAS IT ?
MID-MORNING.
WAY BEFORE NOON.
WELL, THEY SURE START
EARLY IN STEPFORD,
DON'T THEY ?
YOU MEAN THE GUY JUST-JUST
WALKED UP BEHIND HER...
AND HE PUT HIS HANDS
ON HER BOOBS ?
WELL, HOW DID HE DO IT,
EXACTLY ?
WAS IT LIKE THIS ?
WALTER !
OR WAS IT LIKE THIS ?
YOU'RE GETTING ME ALL SOAPY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO
GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT.
IT'S MY LEGAL MIND.
IT'S YOUR SEXY MIND.
STEPFORD HAS REALLY
DONE THINGS TO YOU.
WELL, I'D LIKE TO CHRISTEN
EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE BEFORE
I PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE.
JUST FINISH THE DISHES FIRST.
YEAH.
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY.
WELL, I DIDN'T WITNESS ANY
SOFT-CORE PORNO LIKE YOU,
SO IT'S DULL BY COMPARISON.
BUT, UH,
I DID, UH, MEET SOME OF
THE OTHER STEPFORD COMMUTERS.
YOU WANT COFFEE ?
SANKA.
I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING YET.
REGULAR WILL BE ALL RIGHT.
THEY SEEM LIKE
A BRIGHT BUNCH OF GUYS.
THEY WERE TELLING ME ABOUT
THE MEN'S ASSOCIATION.
APPARENTLY,
IT'S THE THING TO JOIN.
IT'S QUITE AN HONOR
TO BE INVITED TO JOIN.
- WHY IS IT AN HONOR ?
- WHY IS IT AN HONOR ?
THE COMMUTERS AND TOWNIES.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY--
TV EXECUTIVES,
SHRINKS, THE SCIENTISTS,
THE POLICE CHIEF,
THE FIRE CHIEF,
THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL,
SO DID THEY ASK YOU ?
- DID THEY ASK ME ?
- YES, WALTER.
AM I GOING CRAZY ?
YOU KEEP REPEATING
THE QUESTIONS.
WELL, IN A WAY, YES.
IN A WAY YOU COULD REFUSE OR
IN A WAY YOU HAD TO ACCEPT ?
THEY SAID I HAD
A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING IN,
WHICH I FELT GOOD ABOUT.
I HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH THAT
THERE'S ONE RULE THAT, UH,
I DON'T MUCH CARE FOR,
BUT APPARENTLY...
WHAT RULE IS THAT ?
WELL, RIGHT NOW,
IT'S STRICTLY MEN ONLY.
I GIVE UP ON YOU.
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?
WHY DON'T YOU EVER ONCE
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH ?
YOU PRETEND WE DECIDE
THINGS TOGETHER, BUT IT'S
ALWAYS YOU, WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU ASKED ME IF I LIKED THIS
PLACE, AND I FOUND YOU'D
ALREADY MADE A DOWN PAYMENT.
NOW YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT
THE LOUSY MEN'S ASSOCIATION,
AND IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS
YOU'VE ALREADY JOINED.
WHY BOTHER TO
ASK ME AT ALL ?
I'M GONNA PUT
THE KIDS TO BED.
COME ON.
DADDY IS WAITING.
YES, YOU MAY.
COME ON.  COME ON !
HOW MUCH IS IT ?
$53.13.
$53.13.
WALTER, WAIT, WAIT.
WALTER, HAVE YOU MADE IT OUT ?
YEAH, I JUST MADE IT OUT.
WHY ?
OH, MY GOD.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
YOU CAN RING IT SEPARATELY.
HOLD IT A SECOND,
MRS. SUNDERSEN.
OH, SHIT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY.  I'M SORRY.
OH, NO,
IT'S NOTHING REALLY.
IT'S JUST THE SURPRISE.
I--  I'M FINE.
IT'S JUST MY HEAD.  I--
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHIN'.
IT WAS JUST ONE OF
THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW.
NO, I'M FINE.
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
I DIDN'T SEE THE CAR COMING.
IT-IT CAME RIGHT OUT.
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
I'M FINE.
I'M REALLY FINE.
WELL, I THINK THAT SHE HAD
SORT OF AN ACCIDENT.
GET AN AMBULANCE
DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
WE HAD AN ACCIDENT.
IN THE PARKING LOT.
GET IT DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY
IN THE PARKING LOT !
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
I'M LOOKING AT--
I CAN SEE IT RIGHT NOW.
GET IT DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY !
DON'T GIVE ME A HARD TIME !
THIS IS ALL SO SILLY.
I'M FINE.
-
- WHAT CAN I DO, CAROL ?
TELL ME.
MY-MY GROCERIES.
THIS IS ALL SO SILLY.
IT'S JUST MY HEAD.  I--
OH, IT'S ALL SO SILLY.
IT-IT'S JUST MY HEAD.
TWO HOURS
YOU'D WAIT IN NEW YORK.
- OKAY, PULL IT ON OUT.
-
I GUESS THAT'S THE FRIENDLIEST
ACCIDENT I EVER SAW.  WHAT ?
YOU KNOW--
WE MAY BE NEW HERE,
BUT ISN'T STEPFORD HOSPITAL
THAT WAY ?
NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE WRONG.  IT--
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
THE AMBULANCE WENT THAT WAY,
DIDN'T IT ?
WHAT IS IT ?
WHAT IS IT, SWEETIE ?
I THINK TEDDY'S
GONNA CRY ALL NIGHT.
OH, NO.  LOOK.
HE'S HAPPY.  LOOK IT.
NO, THAT'S HIS UNHAPPY FACE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAS UPSET HIM ?
HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS ROOM.
OH, YES, HE DOES.
HE TOLD ME HE LOVES IT HERE.
HE LOVES THE QUIET.
HE'S THINKING ABOUT
ALL THE HONEY HE CAN GET
OUT OF THE TREES HERE.
HE TOLD ME HE LIKED IT
EVEN BETTER THAN CENTRAL PARK,
BECAUSE HE CAN TAKE WALKS
BY HIMSELF...
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT GETTING LOST.
HE'S REALLY A STEPFORD BEAR.
HE REALLY KNOWS
HIS WAY AROUND.
WALTER ?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
YEAH.
IT'S AWFULLY LATE.
EVERYTHING GO OKAY
AT THE INITIATION ?
IT WASN'T AN INITIATION.
THEY JUST SHOWED ME
AROUND THE PLACE...
AND THEY ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO JOIN,
AND I SAID YES, I DID.
GOOD.  WALTER,
I WAS WORRIED.
I WAKE UP, IT'S
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
YOU'RE SITTING HERE
ALONE, DRINKING.
- I'M COMING TO BED.
- DID ANYBODY SAY SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU ?
I'M NOT UPSET.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE UPSET ABOUT.
IT'S NOT FINE.
I WAS WORRIED.
WALTER, I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
I REALLY LOVE YOU.
DO-DO-DO YOU KNOW THAT ?
I-I REALLY DO.
AND I KNOW THAT
I SCREWED THIS WHOLE THING UP.
YOU DIDN'T WANNA MOVE HERE.
I KNOW THAT.  NO.
I'LL GET OVER IT.
I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN OVER IT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I REALLY LOVE YOU ?
YES.
LET'S GO TO BED.
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GETTIN' OLD.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OLD.
I FEEL LIKE IT.
HI !
- ARE YOU JOANNA EBERHART ?
- YES.
JOANNA EBERHART ?
AVID SHUTTERBUG,
EX-GOTHAMITE...
WHO MISSES THE NOISE
OF THE NAKED CITY ?
WHOO-HOO !
HI.  I'M BOBBY.
BOBBY MARKOWE.
THAT'S UPWARD MOBILITY
FOR MARKOWITZ.
I'M ALSO AN EX-GOTHAMITE
WHO'S BEEN LIVING HERE
IN AJAX COUNTRY...
FOR JUST OVER A MONTH NOW,
AND I'M GOING CRAZY.
YOU SEE, DOCTOR,
MY PROBLEM IS THAT...
GIVEN COMPLETE
FREEDOM OF CHOICE,
I DON'T WANNA SQUEEZE
THE GODDAMN CHARMIN.
ANYWAY,
I SAW YOUR NAME HERE.
DON'T THINK I'M--
ON THAT ?  OH, NO.
YEAH.  IT WAS FANTASTIC.
FANTASTIC.
HERE YOU ARE.  WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK YOU GOT A HEADLINE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
NO.
YOU'VE GOT A HEADLINE
ON THIS PAGE.
HERE SHE IS.
"EBERHART MOVES TO STEPFORD."
I WISH THEY'D USED--
"AVID SHUTTERBUG."
I KNEW YOU WERE FANTASTIC.
HAVE I SEEN ANY OF
YOUR PICTURES IN MAGAZINES ?
I KNOW I MUST HAVE.
RIGHT ?
I DOUBT IT.
I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU'RE TERRIFIC.
I KNOW YOU ARE.
EBER-- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THINK I DO KNOW YOU.
ANYWAY--
BUT I'M GLAD
TO HAVE A FRIEND.
ME TOO.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
DO YOU WANT TO GO AND
HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK ?
EAT.
EAT ?  OKAY.
YEAH.
I GOT ALL THIS JUNK HERE.
GOT ANY SMOKES ?
YEAH.
COME ON.
I DROPPED MY BEST CAMERA
ON MY FOOT.
HAVE YOU REALLY GOT FILM
IN THOSE THINGS ?
OH, YES.
I'M THE VERY-AVERAGE
SHUTTERBUG.
OH, YEAH.
LISTEN, I REALLY,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
ORDINARILY,
I DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
TO THAT NEWSPAPER...
BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF IT.
I KNOW.
BUT I SAW YOUR NAME,
AND IT STOOD OUT
FOR SOME REASON.
WHATEVER MADE YOU
CHOOSE STEPFORD ?
I DIDN'T, WALTER DID.
OH, YEAH, IT FIGURES.
DAVE BROUGHT US HERE
BECAUSE OF LAND VALUES.
HE'S BEST IN BED
WHEN THE MARKET'S UP.
I THINK I'LL BREAK
INTO WALTER'S SCOTCH.
HEY, HEY, HEY !
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ?
I'M GONNA LIKE YOU.
YEAH.  OH.
A MESSY KITCHEN.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
A HOME AWAY FROM HOME.
OH, MY.  OF COURSE,
IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO MINE.
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY OF
THOSE MAGNIFICENT...
PEANUT BUTTER HANDPRINTS
ALL OVER YOUR CABINETS YET.
BUT THEN YOU'RE NEW HERE,
AND STEPFORD WASN'T
RUINED IN A DAY.
HELLO, HI-C.
HEY, YOU WANT A RING-DING ?
I SMUGGLED IT OVER THE BORDER.
- WHAT YEAR IS IT ?
- '59.
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.
IT'LL BE GREAT
WITH SCOTCH.
YEAH.
TWO THINGS I ALWAYS CARRY--
TAMPAX AND RING-DINGS.
AND I DON'T EVEN WANNA THINK
WHAT THAT MEANS.
I'LL TELL YOU.
THANKS.
IT'S LIKE MAIDS
HAVE BEEN DECLARED ILLEGAL,
AND THE HOUSEWIFE
WITH THE NEATEST PLACE GETS
ROBERT REDFORD FOR CHRISTMAS.
AND BELIEVE ME,
IF THAT'S THE PRIZE I'D ENTER,
BUT NOBODY'LL TELL
WHAT THE CONTEST RULES ARE.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
- NOT TO MENTION THAT CREEPY
MEN'S ASSOCIATION.
- YOURS TOO ?
EVERY NIGHT.
DAVE WOULDN'T MISS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY DO UP THERE ?
WATCH DIRTY MOVIES AND REMINISCE
ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
WHAT GOOD OLD DAYS ?
LIKE THOSE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN
USED THE AIRBRUSH.
RING-DINGS AND SCOTCH--
GREAT COMBINATION.
WE MAY HAVE
STARTED SOMETHING.
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.
CHEERS.
TOTALLY DISGUSTING.
DON'T YOU LIKE IT ?
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
I LIKE THE BEST.
YOU'RE VERY HONEST.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.
IT'S AWFUL.
SHIT.
HEY, IT'S ME.
I'M HERE AND I'M ON
THE NEW PROJECTS COMMITTEE.
YEAH, NEW PROJECTS.
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
SOME OF THE GUYS, UH,
MEETING AT OUR HOUSE ?
LIKE NOW, TONIGHT ?
WELL, OKAY.
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
I'LL ACTUALLY GET TO SEE YOU
AND SOME LIVING PEOPLE.
GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES, HUH ?
WE'LL BE ALONG
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
BYE-BYE.
SHE'D LOVE IT.
GOOD.
YOU'RE NOT ALTOGETHER SURE
ABOUT STEPFORD YET,
ARE YOU, WALTER ?
WELL, NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I, UH--
I THINK I AM.
IT'S A--
IT'S A BIG CHANGE.
A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER,
WALTER.
I THOUGHT I'D, UH,
MAKE IT INTO SORT OF
A DEN-CUM-PLAYROOM.
MAYBE I'LL PUT THE POOL TABLE
RIGHT OVER THERE.
I THOUGHT I'D GO TO TOWN,
REALLY SPOIL MYSELF.
BE G-G-GREAT FOR THE KIDS.
WELL, WHO'S TALKING
ABOUT THE KIDS ?
THIS IS A PLAYROOM.
THEY AIN'T GONNA BE
ALLOWED IN.
I LIKE TO WATCH WOMEN
DOING LITTLE DOMESTIC CHORES.
YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT TOWN.
WHO IS THE ONE
WHO WANTED TEA ?
CLAUDE.
CLAUDE AXHELM.
STUTTERS.
I'M NOT GOOD ON NAMES.
- BECAUSE I USED TO WORK
AT DISNEYLAND.
- NO, REALLY.
THAT'S REALLY.
DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME ?
NO.
WHY NOT ?
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE SOMEONE
WHO ENJOYS MAKING
OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY.
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.
NO KIDDING ?
YOUR TEA.
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, I'M-I'M REALLY INTO
S-S-SPEECH WORK.
W-W-WORDS.  PERHAPS
WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT IT SOMETIME.
YEAH, CERTAINLY.
ABSOLUTELY.
LET'S GET YOU A NAPKIN.
I HOPE YOUR WIFE HAS
GOTTEN OVER THE ACCIDENT.
IT WAS YOUR WIFE,
WASN'T IT ?
OH, YEAH.
YES, IT WAS NOTHING.
IT LOOKED WORSE THAN IT WAS.
I SHOULD GO AND SEE HER.
I SHOULD'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
SHE'D LIKE THAT.
SHALL WE MAKE A START ?
IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF JOANNA SITS IN ?
DEFINITELY.
I'M SURE SHE'S GOT
A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE.
OH, UH,
YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU
A MORE COMFORTABLE CHAIR, HON ?
NO, IT'S OKAY.
MY DRINK.
EXCUSE ME.
WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR, SO WHO'S
GONNA BE THE FIRST GENIUS ?
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE, UH,
C-C-CHRISTMAS TOYS...
FOR THE UNDER--
FOR THE POOR KIDS ?
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, CLAUDE,
IT'S ONLY MAY.
YEAH, WELL, UH, I-I GUESS
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO
START THINKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS.
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TRY
A TAG SALE HERE THIS YEAR.
BARN DANCE.
A BARN DANCE ?
THAT WENT OUT IN THE '40s.
I THINK A BARN DANCE
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.
WELL, I'D LIKE IT ANYWAY.
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT
A SQUARE DANCE, AREN'T YOU ?
WELL, IT'S A TERRIFIC WAY
TO RAISE MONEY.
TAG SALE ?
I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A BARN DANCE.
YOU WANNA DO A BARN DANCE OR--
WE EVEN SUGGESTED
THE POSSIBILITY OF PUTTING
THE BARN DANCE...
AND THE TAG SALE TOGETHER
AT THE SAME TIME.
CLAUDE ?
YOU ARE FULL OF CRAP.
AND I WANNA TELL YOU THAT
I'M KIND OF DISGUSTED...
ABOUT THE WAY YOU GUYS
ARE HANDLING YOURSELVES
AT THIS MEETING.
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO APPOINT ME CHAIRMAN.
I'LL RUN THE WHOLE THING.
EXCUSE ME.
LET ME SEE IF I KIND OF GET
THE CONSENSUS OF ALL THIS.
IS THAT--
IS THAT FAIR TO SAY ?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE--
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY
SUCCESSFUL MEETING, DON'T YOU ?
I THINK WE'VE GOT ENOUGH THINGS
THAT WE CAN PRESENT
TO THE MEETING.
WHEN IS THE NEXT MEETING ?
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE CHILDREN.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
ANYBODY ELSE WANT A NIGHTCAP ?
YEAH, GET ME
A DECENT BRANDY, WILL YA,
INSTEAD OF THIS
COOKING SHERRY.
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.
YOU'RE NOT IKE MAZZARD,
ARE YOU ?
OH, NO.
YOU BLIGHTED MY ADOLESCENCE,
YOU KNOW THAT.
I THOUGHT I BLIGHTED
YOUR ADOLESCENCE.
I CAN'T GET OVER THIS.
IS THIS FOR ME ?
- KEEP IT.
- KEEP IT ?
I'LL INSURE IT.
MY PLEASURE.
HERE YOU ARE, IKE.
SEE WHAT YOU MISSED ?
OH.  OH, YEAH.
IT'S-- IT'S VERY GOOD...
YOU'VE BEEN A LONG TIME.
I'M JUST, UH,
CLEARING UP SOME THINGS.
I JUST CAN'T STAND
TO COME DOWN IN THE MORNING
TO A BUNCH OF FILTHY ASHTRAYS.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
NICE BUNCH OF GUYS, HUH ?
YOU SERIOUS ?
YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN
THOSE BORES THE TIME OF DAY
BACK IN MANHATTAN.
I MEAN, OKAY,
I WAS PLEASED TO GET THIS
AND HE WAS QUITE SWEET,
BUT THE REST--
WELL, I DON'T HAPPEN TO AGREE.
WALTER, YOU MUST AGREE.
MY GOD, THEY'RE WORSE THAN
YOUR SENIOR PARTNERS.
WELL, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR ?
THEY WERE DUMMIES.
I MEAN, TAKE
THAT GRADUATE OF DISNEYLAND.
WELL, HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE
A Ph.D FROM BERKELEY.
HE RUNS A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
CORPORATION.
WHAT DO THEY MAKE,
SLEEPING PILLS ?
LOOK, THIS ISN'T ME,
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
ISN'T YOU.
YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON.
LOOK, THIS-THIS IS STEPFORD.
IT'S NOT NEW YORK.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH,
AND-AND THEY SUIT ME.
ARE YOU GONNA BE AROUND LATER ?
OKAY, BYE.
YEAH.
LISTEN, MARIE, YOU WANNA
GO FOR A SWIM LATER ?
MARIE ?  HUH ?
OH, YES, I'D LOVE THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.  HEY, I HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN YOUR DRINK.
WHERE IS MY WINE ?
HI, WALTER.
I'M FINE.
HOW ARE YOU ?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
DAVE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YEAH.
ED IS HAVING A HELL OF A TIME
DOWN THERE WITH BOBBY.
GIVE HIM A HAND, WILL YOU ?
OKAY, SURE, WE'LL GO DOWN
AND GIVE HIM A HAND.
GOOD.
GET SOME DRINKS DOWN
TO THE POOL RIGHT AWAY.
COME ON.
MM-HMM !
CAN YOU BELIEVE ALL THIS ?
FOR A BACHELOR, OLD DIZ
MUST BE QUITE A CATCH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO HOME AND CHANGE ?
LIKE, PUT ON FANCY DRESS ?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU ?
HELLO.
- FINE, THANK YOU.
- LOVELY PARTY.
- YES.
-
DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT THE FOOD ?
LIKE WALTER SAYS,
IT'S ALL SO DAZZLING.
WHY DON'T I LIKE IT ?
I MEAN, I LIKE IT.
IT'S PERFECT.
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE IT ?
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT.
AM I MAKING ANY SENSE ?
HI.
WELL, HI, YOU TWO.
YOU WANT TO COME
AND MEET SOME PEOPLE ?
WHY NOT ?
WE'RE NOT PROUD.
OH, YOU HAVEN'T GOT A DRINK.
I MUST GET YOU A DRINK.
GOOD SHOT.
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S FIRST ?
I GOT A MEDIUM-WELL--
WHAT IS THAT ?
IS THAT A MEDIUM--
THAT'S A MEDIUM.
THAT'S A RARE.
MMM !
I'LL JUST DIE IF
I DON'T GET THIS RECIPE.
I'LL JUST DIE IF
I DON'T GET THIS RECIPE.
I'LL JUST DIE IF
I DON'T GET THIS RECIPE.
WALTER ?
TAKE OVER, WILL YOU ?
HOW MANY OF THESE
HAVE YOU HAD ?
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
HANDLE THIS STUFF ?
I'LL JUST DIE IF
I DON'T GET THIS RECIPE.
WHY THE HELL DO YOU
DO THIS IN PUBLIC ?
WE'LL-WE'LL JUST GO
AND GET A LITTLE COFFEE.
WELL, IT WAS
THIS PROBLEM I HAD.
YOU SEE,
I-I COULDN'T HANDLE IT.
IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.
I GUESS THAT'S
ONE OF THE REASONS
TED MOVED US TO STEPFORD.
THE DRINKING WAS
GETTING SO BAD AND...
HE BLAMED THE CITY
AND ALL ITS PRESSURES.
BUT I DID, AND I'M SORRY
I RUINED IT ALL.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE, CAROL.
- NOT TO US.
WE JUST FELT
THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TWO UNDERSTAND,
YOU BEING THE NEWEST
IN STEPFORD.
WE DIDN'T WANT YOU GETTING
THE WRONG OPINION.
"WE" ?
WHO IS "WE" ?
OH, WELL, TED, NATURALLY,
AND IKE WAS THERE AND--
HE'S SO OLD AND SMART.
AFTER I'D SOBERED UP SOME,
WE ASKED HIM AND--
YOU MEAN THE MEN MADE YOU
COME AND APOLOGIZE LIKE THIS ?
OH, NO.
NO, I WANTED TO, REALLY.
ALL THEY DID WAS SORT OF
CONFIRM MY FEELINGS.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
COME IN ?
OH, NO.
NO, I'VE GOTTA GET BACK.
I-I'VE SEEN CHARMAINE,
AND, UH--
WELL, I--
I OUGHTA GET BACK.
INCREDIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE.
IF I WAS FORCED TO APOLOGIZE
EVERY TIME I GOT SMASHED,
I'D SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE
WANDERING AROUND SAYING,
"I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY."
DIDN'T WE ALL ?
I'M NOT CONTEMPLATING
ANY MAIDENFORM BONFIRES,
BUT THEY COULD CERTAINLY
USE SOMETHING AROUND HERE.
OH, YEAH.
YOU GAME ?
I'M GAME.
BOY, AM I GAME !
WOW !
GEE, IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
BUT I'VE GOT THREE KIDS,
AND THE OLDEST IS SIX.
AND THAT DOESN'T LEAVE ME WITH
A WHOLE LOT OF EXTRA TIME.
WE REALLY UNDERSTAND,
MARIE,
AND WE'RE NOT AFTER YOU
TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE LIFE STYLE.
BUT DOESN'T IT EVER
BOTHER YOU THAT...
THE MOST IMPORTANT
ORGANIZATION IN STEPFORD
IS SEXUALLY ARCHAIC ?
AR-- ARCHAIC ?
OLD-FASHIONED.
OUT-OF-DATE.
DOES IT EVER BOTHER ME ?
NOPE.
I'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH
OF A JOINER, I'M AFRAID.
I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE
I'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY,
WHAT WITH BAKING AND ALL THAT.
THIS ISN'T ANY KIND
OF A LIFELONG COMMITMENT
WE'RE AFTER.
WE JUST WANT TO SEE IF
THERE'S ANY INTERESTS...
FOR SOME KIND OF ACTIVITIES
IN STEPFORD, THAT'S ALL.
WELL, THERE ISN'T
ANY INTEREST HERE, JOANNA.
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS,
BUT I JUST MY BROWNIES.
BUT YOU DO GO OUT
SOMETIMES, DON'T YOU ?
GO OUT ?
OF COURSE I GO OUT.
I'M OUT NOW, AREN'T I ?
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE ?
OH, UH--
I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE.
THIS IS WHO ?
CORNELL.
HUSBAND OWNS THE PHARMACY.
SHE WORKS THERE SOMETIMES.
WHAT I'D GIVE FOR HER CHEST.
UH, THERE'S THIS THING
THEY'VE INVENTED.
IT'S CALLED KNOCKING.
OH, DOESN'T INTEREST ME.
I'M A NATURAL-BORN BARGER.
HEY.
IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE ?
MUST BE.
LAST HOUSE ON SNOWFLAKE LANE.
YOU'RE SURE NOW ?
WE DON'T WANNA
STRIKE OUT AGAIN.
"OH, GOD, FRANK !
I'M SURE !  I'M SURE !"
WASN'T THAT AWFUL ?
ALL YOUR FAULT TOO.
I KNOW, BUT THIS TIME
I GOT US AN INVITATION.
LISTEN, HER NAME'S
CHARMAINE WIMPIRIS.
WE WERE BUYING OUR KIDS' SHOES
AND I GOT TO TALKING,
AND SHE SAID,
"COME ON OVER.
IT SOUNDS INTERESTING."
THE WAY WE'VE BEEN BOMBING OUT,
I CONSIDER THAT A TRIUMPH.
- SHE SAID HER COURT'S
IN THE BACK.
-
GAME !  FIVE-ONE.
LET'S CHANGE.
GOD, THIS IS FUN.
NO !
OH, THAT WAS GREAT.
I HAVEN'T PLAYED
IN SUCH A LONG TIME.
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.
I CAN TELL THAT.
YOU'RE JUST OUT OF PRACTICE.
REALLY ?
HEY, DIDN'T YOU THINK
SHE WAS TERRIFIC ?
I THOUGHT
WERE TERRIFIC.
OH, WELL, LISTEN.
PLAY AT MY PLACE
ANY TIME YOU WANT.
I REALLY MEAN THAT.
GINNY FISHER USED TO PLAY,
BUT SHE FINKED OUT ON ME.
THE ONLY COMPETITION I'VE GOT
LEFT ARE TWO TEENAGE BOYS
WITH PERMANENT ERECTIONS.
- SEND THEM TO MY PLACE.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ?
I'D BE LOST WITHOUT 'EM.
WE'LL GIVE YOU
SOME LESSONS.
I'LL GIVE YOU A LESSON.
NO.
COME ON.  I NEED THE WORKOUT.
THANK YOU, NETTIE.
ISN'T NETTIE MARVELOUS ?
A GERMAN VIRGO.
THEIR THING IS TO SERVE.
OH !  THAT'S WHY
WE WON THE WAR.
WELL, GIRLS, I--
I DIDN'T GET YOU HERE
ON FALSE PRETENSES.
I'M INTERESTED.
I'M NO FANATIC,
BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED.
ACTUALLY, WE MOVED HERE
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO,
AND ED JOINS THIS
MEN'S ASSOCIATION.
BUT FRANKLY, ANYTHING THAT
GETS HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE NIGHTS
IS FINE WITH ME.
IF WE COULD GET
A CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING
GROUP GOING, YOU'D COME ?
- WHAT ?
- A CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING
SESSION.
A BITCHING SESSION,
YOU MEAN.
LIKE A SHOT, I'D COME.
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT
ED TRIES PUTTING ME THROUGH.
HE HAS A RUBBER SUIT
MADE FOR ME IN ENGLAND.
HOW ABOUT THAT,
SPORTS FANS ?
WHAT IS A RUBBER SUIT ?
I'M, UH, AN ACCENT FREAK.
I'M NOT SURE WHY.
PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF--
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
NOTICED OR NOT, BUT I STAMMER.
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG,
YOU MEAN.
NO, NO.
I STILL DO.
IT'S JUST I WORK EXTRA HARD
TO CONTROL IT.
NOW, HERE.
I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN
EVERY PLACE YOU'VE EVER LIVED,
FROM WHEN YOU WERE BORN
UNTIL NOW.
AND THIS IS JUST
STANDARD VOCABULARY.
SEE, IT'S JUST
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE ALPHABET.
"A": 'ABACK', 'ABANDON'.
LIKE-LIKE THAT.
AND, UH, THIS HERE'S
EASY TO OPERATE.
JUST PUSH THE SWITCH
AND TALK INTO IT.
I THINK I CAN MANAGE THAT,
BUT... WHAT'S THIS FOR ?
- JUST A LIFELONG HOBBY.
- DON'T TOUCH IT.
SEE, ONCE I GET
ENOUGH SAMPLES,
I AIM TO FEED THEM ALL INTO
A COMPUTER AND PROGRAM IT.
WHAT I'LL GET BACK IS
AN INSTANT GEOGRAPHICAL RUNDOWN
ON A PERSON.
I REALLY THINK IT'LL BE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINGERPRINTS
IN POLICE WORK.
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,
CLAUDE.
BUT IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.
WE STEPFORD WIVES
ARE BUSY, BUSY, BUSY.
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOUR WIFE.
IS HE GOING
TO TAKE YOUR FINGERPRINTS ?
NO, SWEETIE.
JUST LIKE YOUR WIFE.
BOBBY AND I TRIED TO INVOLVE HER
IN ONE OF OUR PROJECTS,
BUT SHE HAD
TOO MUCH IRONING.
IF THEY COULD FIND
THE TIME FOR ME,
I COULD FIND IT FOR YOU.
ISN'T THIS, UH,
KIND OF BLACKMAIL, JOANNA ?
IT'S WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY
GREAT, CLAUDE.
USUALLY WE, UH,
START OUT BITCHING,
BUT MAYBE IF WE'RE LUCKY
WE CAN GET INTO SOMETHING
MORE CONSTRUCTIVE.
ANYBODY
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ?
WELL, GOOD.
THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET STARTED.
WELL, HOW ABOUT IF I START ?
WELL...
I THINK THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN WALTER CARES MORE ABOUT
THE LAW THAN HE DOES ABOUT ME,
AND THAT CAN HURT.
I DON'T THINK THAT, UH,
ED EVER LOVED ME.
I MEAN,
HE MARRIED ME
BECAUSE I LOOKED RIGHT.
GOD KNOWS
HE'S GIVEN ME THINGS.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING
ON THAT SCORE, BUT, UH,
HE NEVER LOVED ME.
I DIDN'T BAKE ANYTHING
YESTERDAY.
IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO GET
THE UPSTAIRS FLOOR TO SHINE,
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BAKE, KIT.
THERE'S NO LAW.
HELL, ED'S LUCKY IF I REMEMBER
TO KEEP HIM IN WHITE BREAD.
EASY-ON SPRAY STARCH.
REALLY ?
IT MUST SAVE ME
HALF AN HOUR A DAY AT LEAST.
YOU'LL NEVER RUN SHORT
OF TIME AGAIN.
I GUARANTEE IT.
I'VE JUST BEEN TEMPTED
SO MANY TIMES
TO TRY EASY-ON.
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
A LEADER OR ANYTHING,
BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DELVE QUITE SO SPECIFICALLY
INTO HOUSEWORK.
EASY-ON'S REALLY THAT GOOD,
IS IT ?
IS IT THAT GOOD ?
WELL, IF TIME IS YOUR ENEMY,
MAKE FRIENDS WITH EASY-ON.
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU.
IT'S SO GOOD THAT
IF EVER I BECAME FAMOUS...
AND THE EASY-ON PEOPLE ASKED ME
WOULD I DO A COMMERCIAL,
NOT ONLY WOULD I DO IT,
I'D DO IT FOR FREE.
HOLY COW.
I THINK I'LL, UH,
TAKE FRED FOR A WALK.
FRED ?  WHERE IS HE ?
DID HE GET OUT AGAIN ?
NO.  I SAID I WAS GOING
TO TAKE HIM FOR A WALK.
OH.
YOU'RE GOING OUT ?
NO, I'M GOING TO WALK HIM
AROUND THE BATHROOM.
YOU JUST KEEP DOING
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.
I'M VERY FOND OF YOU.
WELL, I'M FOND OF YOU TOO.
FRED !
FREDDIE !
WANNA GO FOR A WALK ?
FRED !
COME ON BACK HERE !
NOW, DON'T GIVE ME
A HARD TIME !
FRED !
FRED ?
FRED, COME HERE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, LADY.
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO FRIGHTEN YOU.
OH, IT'S MRS. EBERHART.
YES.
AND YOU DID FRIGHTEN ME.
ONCE AGAIN, MRS. EBERHART,
MY APOLOGIES.
BUT THIS IS
A PRETTY QUIET TOWN.
A LOT OF VERY NICE HOUSES
LIKE YOUR OWN.
PEOPLE HAVE VALUABLE THINGS.
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
SEE THAT OLD MANSION
OVER THERE ?
SOME RAILROAD TYCOON
BUILT IT IN 1870.
BEFORE THE MEN'S ASSOCIATION
TOOK IT OVER,
IT WAS A WRECK.
SO WE HAVE TO BE
VERY CAREFUL.
WE CAN'T LET PEOPLE
JUST WALK AROUND AT NIGHT.
ONE OF THE REASONS
I MOVED FROM THE CITY...
WAS SO I COULD
WALK AROUND AT NIGHT.
WELL, CERTAINLY YOU AND FRED
CAN WALK AROUND AT NIGHT.
BUT I'D STICK
A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME.
I SEE.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.
COME ON, ED.
LET ME DRIVE.
YOU'RE IN NO FIT STATE,
OKAY ?
ALL RIGHT ?
JUST LIE BACK AND RELAX.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
JOANNA.
WHAT ?
IS THAT RIGHT, DEAR ?
THAT'S LOVELY, HONEY.
ALL RIGHT, LADIES ?
GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT ?
- OH, YES, THANKS.
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU.
YES, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT ?
THAT WAS FRANK.
FRANK ?
THE HOUSE.  REMEMBER ?
THAT WAS FRANK.
THAT WAS MRS. FRANK.
OH, GOD,
FRANK, YES.
OH, I REMEMBER.
I REMEMBER.
OH, GOD.
YEAH.  NOW HOW ABOUT THAT
FOR A STEPFORD TWOSOME ?
OH, GOD, YES.
UH, WAIT A MINUTE.
OKAY.
WE'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.
I HAVE TO GO THIS WAY.
CLEANERS.
YES.
HI.
HI.
HELLO.
HAVE YOU HEARD ?
IT'S JUST SPREADING
LIKE WILDFIRE.
A BLACK FAMILY'S
MOVING INTO TOWN.
OH.
THINK THAT'S GOOD ?
I THINK IT'S GOOD.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I THINK IT'S GOOD SO MUCH
AS I THINK IT'S NATURAL.
CONSIDERING, WELL, I MEAN,
AFTER ALL, WE ARE THE MOST
LIBERAL TOWN AROUND.
- STEPFORD ?
- LIBERAL ?
WELL, SURE.  WE HAD
THE FIRST CHINESE RESTAURANT
IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY.
- AH, YES.
- AND WE HAD THE FIRST
WOMEN'S CLUB...
TO ASK ANY OF THOSE
LIBERATION LADIES...
THERE ARE NO
WOMEN'S CLUBS HERE.
THERE WAS.
I WENT TO A MEETING ONCE.
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
50 OF US THERE.
WELL, WHERE THE HELL
ARE THEY ?
SOME OF THEM MOVED AWAY.
BUT I GUESS MOST OF THEM
JUST PLAIN GOT BORED.
I KNOW I DID.
THERE WE ARE.
OFF YOU GO.
WE WEREN'T ACCOMPLISHING
ANYTHING USEFUL.
YOU MEAN USEFUL
LIKE DOING HOUSEWORK ?
I LIKE TO SEE MY HOME
LOOKING NICE.
LOOK, WE FOUND THIS
AT THE LIBRARY.
I ONLY TOOK THE POST
BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WOULD.
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME.
WHAT YOU'RE INTO,
IS IT ENOUGH ?
WELL, ENOUGH FOR ME
MAYBE'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR YOU, JOANNA.
BUT, WELL, YOU SEE,
TED'S DOING REALLY WELL
IN HIS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NOW.
THE KIDS ARE DOING THE BEST
THEY'VE EVER DONE IN SCHOOL.
AND I'M HERE ALL THE TIME.
I'M REALLY OFF THE BOOZE,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
BUT OUR SEX LIFE
IS BETTER TOO.
LOOK, I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT I'M HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
WE'RE THE CRAZY ONES.
DON'T SAY THAT.
WE'RE NOT.
ARE YOU SURE ?
WE'RE FINE.
OKAY.
WE ARE FINE.
HI.
HOW'D IT GO ?
WHAT ?
OH.
WELL, HE HATED THEM.
I MUST SAY
I WAS INCLINED TO AGREE.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MADE ME TAKE THEM.
BUT STILL--
DID THE GIRLS
BRING FRED OVER WHEN--
WHEN THEY CAME ?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
OH, SHOOT.  AND HE HAS
NO LICENSE.  NOTHING.
COULD I LEAVE THE KIDS HERE
WHILE I GO LOOK FOR HIM ?
SURE.  I'LL GO WITH YOU.
JAY, WILL YOU
TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS ?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WE'LL FIND HIM.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT
FINK SAID IN THE GALLERY.
FRED !  FRED !
DID YOU SEE WHAT I SAW ?
YOU FOUND HIM ?
NO.
BACK AT CHARMAINE'S.
OH, MY GOD !
YOU SEE, ED HATED TENNIS.
BUT HE NEVER SAID A WORD.
ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TO PLEASE ME.
WELL, I WANT
TO PLEASE HIM NOW.
YOU SEE, WE SPENT THIS WEEKEND
AT THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE INN
IN VERMONT.
JUST ED AND ME, YOU KNOW,
TALKING THINGS THROUGH.
AND WE HAD
THE MOST TERRIFIC TIME.
I CAN'T GET
MY MIND OPERATING.
- OH.  BESIDES,
I'M JUST SWAMPED WITH WORK.
- WORK ?
OH, YES.
I FIRED NETTIE.
YEAH, IT WAS--
IT WAS JUST THE BEING
ALONE WITH ED THAT DID IT.
ALL I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
BEFORE WAS JUST ME.
WELL, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE RESEARCH, OKAY ?
AND A LOT OF THINKING.
AND I KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO SAY
IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY,
BUT IF YOU LAUGH AT IT,
I SWEAR TO GOD
I'M GONNA BE SICK.
OKAY,
YOU REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT
THE TEXAS TRANQUILIZER ?
IT WAS IN
I CUT IT OUT.
WAIT A SEC.
SIT DOWN.
ISSUE DATED:
OCTOBER 4, 1971.
'71, RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT WHY THERE
ARE ALMOST NO MURDERS
IN EL PASO.
THIS SCIENTIST HAS THIS THEORY
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
COMES FROM THE WATER IN EL PASO.
IT COMES FROM DEEP WELLS,
AND IT'S GOT SOME CHEMICAL
TRANQUILIZER IN IT.
AND, WELL, READ.
SEE, DALLAS IS OVER
TWO TIMES AS BIG AS EL PASO.
BUT THAT YEAR, THERE WERE
OVER 242 MURDERS IN DALLAS,
AND THERE WERE ONLY
JOANNA.
JOANNA, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT'S GOING ON IN STEPFORD.
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THE WATER...
THAT TURNS US
INTO HAUSFRAUS, DRONES,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
CHARMAINE'S CHANGED,
CAROL VAN SANT'S CHANGED...
AND SO HAVE ALL THOSE
OTHER WOMEN'S CLUB MEMBERS.
WELL I--
I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.
IT CAN'T ALL BE COINCIDENCE.
AND LABS.
WHO KNOWS WHAT ?
INTO STEPFORD RIVER.
LISTEN, THE 6:00 NEWS
SCARES ME EVERY NIGHT.
I DON'T SEE WHAT'S
SO FAR OUT ABOUT MY THEORY.
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T
WE WRITE THE STATE
ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY...
AND HAVE THEM CHECK
THE WATER IN THE RESERVOIR ?
AH, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
I'VE WORKED FOR THEM, JOANNA.
AND IF THEY'RE
WAY ABOVE AVERAGE
OR ANY GOOD AT ALL,
THEY'LL MANAGE TO LOSE A LETTER
IF YOU SEND IT TO THEM.
THEY TEACH COURSES
IN MISFILING AT THOSE PLACES.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO ?
I THINK
WE OUGHT TO TAKE A SAMPLE
OF THE WATER OURSELVES...
AND THEN GET IT
TO A TRUSTWORTHY CHEMIST.
THE TROUBLE IS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW,
GUYS AT THAT STINKING
MEN'S ASSOCIATION.
I LOST MY VIRGINITY
TO A TRUSTWORTHY CHEMIST.
HA HA !
NO KIDDING !
DID HE DO IT ON BLUE CROSS ?
HIS NAME
WAS RAYMOND CHANDLER.
OH, GOSH.
AND WE HAD A GAG,
A SORT OF A STUPID,
PRIVATE THING GOING.
I USED TO ASK HIM
WHY HE DIDN'T TALK
LIKE HE WROTE.
HE WASN'T A BIT HARD-BOILED,
AND HE HATED ANY SORT
OF VIOLENCE.
BUT I KEPT IT GOING.
SOME NIGHTS I WOULDN'T
LET HIM TOUCH ME...
UNTIL HE TOLD ME
THE PLOT OF HIS NEXT NOVEL.
WHICH WAS, OF COURSE,
SOMETIMES,
IT NEARLY DROVE HIM CRAZY.
ISN'T IT FUNNY
THE THINGS YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE ?
WE WERE BOTH SENIORS AT NYU.
AND IT WASN'T JUST PASSION.
IT WAS LOVE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU MARRY HIM ?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE WE TOOK THE JOKE TOO FAR.
MAYBE THE FUN WENT OUT OF IT.
I THOUGHT WALTER WAS GOING
TO BECOME PERRY MASON.
SO IT WAS
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT ?
ANYWAY, I THINK
IF I LOOK IN THE PHONE BOOK...
AND THIS GUY'S
STILL IN NEW YORK,
THEN HE'S OUR MAN.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ?
NO.
I CAN'T JUST
CALL HIM UP AND SAY, "HI.
I USED TO BE JOANNA INGALLS.
YOU DEFLOWERED ME 12 YEARS AGO.
WOULD YOU CHECK MY WATER ?"
THE FINAL
GAS CHROMATOGRAPH READINGS
WILL BE COMING IN IN A MINUTE.
THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR THIS, RAY.
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.
LONG TIME.
TWELVE YEARS.
- YOU MARRIED A DENTIST,
WASN'T THAT IT ?
- LAWYER.
ARE YOU HAPPY ?
- YES, VERY.
- GOOD.  GOOD.
- ARE YOU MARRIED ?
- GOING ON NINE YEARS.
MM.
AND, YES, VERY.
HERE'S THE REPORT
YOU ORDERED, MR. CHANDLER.
THANK YOU, ELIZABETH.
WELL, I CAN SAY
RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT, UH--
YOU GOT WATER IN YOUR WATER.
-
- NOW, WHAT CAN I
TELL YOU GIRLS ?
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO DRINK TOO MUCH OF IT,
BUT, UH,
CAN'T YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ?
YES.
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT, I'D
SPECIFICALLY HAVE TO KNOW...
WHAT IT IS
I'M TRYING TO FIND.
I MEAN,
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
LOOK AT THAT.
I'M SORRY.
UH, ABOUT WHAT ?
THE WOMEN IN STEPFORD
LOVE HOUSEWORK,
AND I THOUGHT THERE
MIGHT BE SOMETHING
IN THE WATER.
- WHERE DID YOU FIND HER ?
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
- NO, IT ISN'T.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LOOK, THAT WAS RUDE OF ME.
MARKOWE.
MARKOWE.
I CAN TELL YOU CATEGORICALLY...
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A CLEANER COMPELLER.
MAKE A MILLION BUCKS,
WIN THE NOBEL PRIZE...
I GUESS WE'RE GOING.
I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE.
I'M SORRY.
TELL HER THAT.
YES.
HEY, WE BLEW IT,
DIDN'T WE ?
I DON'T KNOW, RAYMOND.
IT'S HARD TO BE SMART.
YEAH.
BYE-BYE.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS.
I'M NOT GOING TO END UP
LIKE ONE OF THOSE
PAN SCRUBBERS.
I'M GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF STEPFORD.
I'LL ASK DAVE TONIGHT,
AND WE'LL MOVE.
HEY, HEY, HEY,
YOU TOO.
YOU CAN'T BREAK UP
A TEAM LIKE US.
WE'RE THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN
SINCE LAUREL AND HARDY.
ZOOT SUIT, ZULU.
AND THAT'S THAT, CLAUDE.
I FINALLY FINISHED.
WHEN WAS THAT ?
WALTER, WOULD YOU MOVE ?
MM-HMM.
NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T MEAN--
- WHAT ?  WHAT DID I SAY ?
- I MEANT MOVE.
LEAVE STEPFORD.
BUT WE JUST
GOT TO STEPFORD.
HEY, ARE YOU
THAT UNHAPPY ?
IS IT EVERYTHING YOU EXPECTED ?
WELL... NO.
NO, IT'S NOT.
BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THE FIRST ONE
TO ADMIT IT.
YOU KNOW, I'M THE ONE
THAT WANTED TO COME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
YOU THINK THE--
YOU THINK THE MEN ARE DULL.
WELL, I THINK
THE WOMEN ARE TOO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MOVE.
YEAH, BUT THE AREA
SURE IS NICE THOUGH,
YOU KNOW.
AND IT'S PERFECT
FOR THE KIDS.
WELL, MAYBE NORWOOD
OR EASTBRIDGE.
OKAY, LET'S MOVE.
YOU MEAN IT ?
THAT'S ALL THERE'S TO IT ?
I JUST HAD TO ASK ?
SHOULDN'T WE AT LEAST
FIGHT OR SOMETHING ?
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO MOVE TONIGHT, JOANNA.
I MEAN, WHAT IS IT,
JUNE ALREADY ?  AND I GOT
ALL THIS WORK PILED UP HERE.
JESUS, I--
OKAY, I TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AROUND,
AND WE'LL FIGURE ON
MOVING IN AUGUST.
THAT WAY THE KIDS
CAN GET SETTLED IN
BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS, AND--
OH, WHY ARE YOU--
HEY, THESE PAPERS
ARE ALL IN SEQUENCE, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE CRUSHING
MR. ZIEGLER'S WILL.
I'LL MAKE YOU A BENEFICIARY.
WELL, I GUESS MR. ZIEGLER
COULD WAIT A LITTLE WHILE.
DO YOU MEAN IT ?
WE CAN MOVE ?
YEAH.
OH, WALTER.
OH, WALTER,
YOU'RE REALLY SWEET.
MM.
GIRLS, I THINK,
AFTER FOUR HOUSES,
I'M GETTING
TO KNOW YOUR TASTE.
THIS MAY BE IT.
HE'S AN I.T.T. V.P.,
TRANSFERRED TO PANAMA,
PROBABLY TO START A REVOLUTION.
OH.
OH, THERE'LL BE AT LEAST
EIGHT LONELY LADIES...
IN EASTBRIDGE CENTER
FOR A WHILE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE GOT AWAY WITH IT
SO CLOSE TO HOME.
OH, MY.
LISTEN, I'LL GO IN FIRST.
YOU STAY HERE.
THEY GAVE ME THE KEY,
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'LL WALK INTO.
THANKS.
OH, MRS. KIRGASSA,
I LOVE YOU.
OH, SHE'S FAT AND LOVELY.
SHE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH,
AND I LOVE HER.  WHAT A TREAT.
HE THREATENED
TO CANCEL THE PLAZA.
WHAT IS THE PLAZA ?
OH, I FORGOT.
I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU...
IF YOU WILL TAKE OUR KIDS
AND THE DOG SO DAVE AND I
CAN HAVE A WEEKEND,
OUR ANNUAL WEEKEND,
AT THE PLAZA.
IT'S TO COMMEMORATE THE TIME
HE TOOK A YOUNG VIRGIN
TO THE THEATER...
AND FAKED HER
UP TO HIS ROOM.
HELL, I HAD
TO LOSE IT SOMETIME.
- THE COAST IS CLEAR.
COME ON, GIRLS.
- RIGHT.
ANYWAY, WILL YOU
DO IT FOR ME ?
DO WHAT ?
TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS
AND THE DOG FOR THE WEEKEND ?
OH, I KNOW IT'S JUST
A HORRIBLE THING FOR YOU
TO THINK ABOUT, ISN'T IT ?
FORGET IT.
NO.  YES, IT IS.
BUT OKAY.
YOU WILL ?
THE GIRLS, AT LEAST,
WILL LOVE HAVING THE DOG.
EVER SINCE
DEAR OLD FRED DEPARTED,
THEY'VE BEEN AFTER ME
TO GET ANOTHER ONE.
YES.
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT WALTER THOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WALTER HATES NOISE.
HEY, THERE'S A DOG
UNDER THE TABLE.
HONEY, COULD I HAVE
SOME MORE COFFEE, PLEASE ?
YES.
CHARLIE IS--
CHARLIE IS UNDER THE TABLE.
COULD I HAVE
SOME MORE COFFEE, PLEASE ?
QUIT IT !
HOW MANY PANCAKES
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE--
HERE.  THANK YOU.
COME ON, CHARLIE.
JOANNA !
YEAH ?
LOOK, I PLAYED MONOPOLY
WITH THEM.  I DIDN'T PASS "GO."
I DIDN'T COLLECT.
WALTER, YOU'VE HAD
SEVEN YEARS OF COLLEGE.
USE YOUR BRAINS.
I THINK MAYBE
IT'S THE BEST I'VE EVER DONE.
BUT HOW DO I AMUSE THEM ?
I AMUSE THEM
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.
THEY KNOW ALL
THE SONGS.
HAVE A SING-ALONG.
A SING-ALONG.
JESUS.
BUT THESE
ARE MY LITTLE GIRLS,
AND THOSE ARE SOMEONE ELSE'S.
MY BEST FRIEND'S
LITTLE BOYS.
AND YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO TELL ME.
AM I CRAZY ?
AREN'T THEY GOOD ?
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.
I DON'T CARE.
NO, I DO CARE.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD.
THESE ARE, UM,
REALLY QUITE GOOD.
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE FRIGHTENED
I MIGHT BE A CRAZY LADY ?
CLEARLY YOU ARE A CRAZY LADY.
BUT CLEARLY AGAIN,
THESE ARE NICE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SAID GOOD.
"REALLY QUITE GOOD," YOU SAID.
GOOD IS BETTER THAN NICE.
Y-YOU'RE NOT CHANGING
YOUR MIND, ARE YOU ?
NO.
THE RESULTS ARE LOVELY.
DON'T GET UPSET AGAIN.
LOVELY IS BETTER THAN GOOD.
BUT, UM,
WHAT FASCINATES ME IS...
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT FROM IT ALL ?
I WANT... SOMEWHERE,
SOMEDAY, SOMEONE TO LOOK
AT SOMETHING AND SAY, "HEY,
THAT REMINDS ME OF AN INGALLS."
INGALLS WAS MY MAIDEN NAME.
I GUESS
I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED.
BOBBY, IT'S ME !
I'VE JUST COME FROM
ATKINSON IN NEW YORK,
AND HE LOVES MY STUFF.
WELL, NOT LOVES, MAYBE,
BUT HE'S GENUINELY
INTERESTED IN MY WORK.
GALLERY
FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS.
THAT'S WONDERFUL, JOANNA.
I'M STICKING MY HEAD
RIGHT IN THE OVEN.
HOW ABOUT THE SHAPE ?
PADDED UPLIFT BRA.
OH, JOANNA,
DAVE TURNED ME LOOSE
IN BERGDORF'S,
BOBBY--
AT THE PLAZA, SOME GUY
TRIED PICKING ME UP
IN THE LOBBY.
OF COURSE,
I DID LOOK TERRIFIC.
BOBBY, YOU'RE NOT
AT THE PLAZA NOW.  SO WHY ARE
YOU WEARING ALL THAT MAKEUP ?
I MEAN, YOU NEVER EVEN
USED TO CLEAN YOUR KITCHEN,
MUCH LESS WEAR MAKEUP.
ADMIT IT, JOANNA.
I WAS A JOKE.
DAVE WORKS HARD
ALL DAY LONG.
AND WHAT DOES HE
COME HOME TO ?  A SLOB.
BOBBY,
IT'S GOTTEN TO YOU NOW.
NOTHING'S GOT ME.
I JUST WANT TO LOOK
LIKE A WOMAN...
AND KEEP MY HOUSE
LOOKING DECENT TOO.
WILL YOU STOP.
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LEAVE STEPFORD EITHER,
ARE YOU ?
NO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHALL I MAKE US
A NICE POT OF COFFEE ?
NO, NO.
I'VE REALLY GOT TO GO NOW.
STOP BY ANYTIME.
I'LL BE HERE.
MY, GOD !  LOOK OUT !
SO YOU PASS A SCHOOL BUS
AND YOU-- AND YOU
DENT THE WAGON.
BOBBY MARKOWE BUYS A NEW BRA,
AND I'VE GOT TO PAY FOR
A NEW MAILBOX FOR THE VAN SANTS.
SO WHAT ?
SO WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, JOANNA ?
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
HER KITCHEN WAS SPARKLING.
YEAH.
SO YOU SAID.
BUT, LOOK, I HATE
TO COME ON LIKE THE HEAVY,
BUT WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH YOU GOING CRAZY ?
IT WASN'T JUST THAT.
IT WASN'T JUST ANYTHING.
SHE'S CHANGED !
AND STOP TELLING ME
I'M CRAZY !
- ARE YOU TWO FIGHTING ?
- NO.
WE DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU FIGHT.
LOOK, WE'RE NOT FIGHTING.
WE'RE JUST-- JUST TALKING.
NOW, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
GO ON OUTSIDE, ALL RIGHT ?
OH, BOY.
THAT'S REALLY TERRIFIC.
THIS IS REALLY
TERRIFIC FOR THEM.
I REMEMBER WHEN MY MOTHER
AND FATHER USED TO YELL
AT EACH OTHER.
I-I-I JUST DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS.
WELL, NEITHER DO I.
I'M SORRY.  I SAID
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE CAR.
BUT I WAS PANICKED AND UPSET.
OH, LOOK,
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S THE REST THAT BOTHERS ME.
JUST TRY TO LOOK AT IT
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, JOANNA.
WALTER, I JUST WANT
TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU.
BOBBY REALLY HAS CHANGED.
BELIEVE ME,
EVERYTHING IN HER HOUSE
LOOKED LIKE A TV COMMERCIAL.
WELL, GOOD !  GOOD !
SHE HAD TO CLEAN IT
SOONER OR LATER.
IT LOOKED LIKE
A GODDAMN PIGSTY !
I-I MEAN, WHEN ARE THINGS
GONNA START SPARKLING
AROUND HERE ?
RAGAMUFFINS.
GEEZ, I WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK.
LOOK, IF YOU PAID A LITTLE
MORE ATTENTION TO YOUR FAMILY...
AND A LITTLE LESS
TO YOUR GODDAMN PICTURE TAKING--
I'M GETTING OUT OF STEPFORD.
AND IF IT'S HARD ON THE KIDS,
I'LL JUST EASE UP ON MY GODDAMN
PICTURE TAKING...
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, WALTER,
IS SURVIVING.
BUT THERE'S ONE CONDITION
OR WE DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
YOU-- YOU SEE SOMEBODY.
YOU GET SOME HELP.
YOU SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.
I'M FINE.
I DON'T NEED TO SEE ANYBODY.
YOU SAY YOU'RE FINE.
BUT ME, I'D--
I'D LIKE ANOTHER OPINION.
BECAUSE I'M NOT TOO ANXIOUS
TO MOVE TO EASTBRIDGE...
AND AFTER FOUR MONTHS THERE
BE TOLD BY MY SWEET WIFE
WE'VE GOT TO MOVE AGAIN...
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THE WAY HER NEW NEIGHBORS
KEEP THEIR HOUSES CLEAN.
AND I DON'T LIKE ASKING IT.
BUT-- BUT YOU WANT ME
TO DISRUPT OUR LIVES...
FOR THE SECOND TIME
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
ON SOME FIXATION YOU'VE GOT.
LOOK... YOU AND ME, WE--
WE DON'T HAVE
TO FIGHT ABOUT THIS.
WE'RE GONNA MOVE.
IT'S-- IT'S ONLY
A FEW MORE WEEKS.
LOOK...
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ANYTHING DRAMATIC.
THERE'S A COUPLE
OF TOPNOTCH GUYS
RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.
JUST TALK TO ONE OF THEM.
THEY'D SEE YOU.
BUT I WOULDN'T SEE THEM.
IF I SEE ANYBODY,
I'LL FIND MY OWN.
WE MOVED TO STEPFORD
WITH OUR CHILDREN,
OH, A FEW MONTHS AGO.
BEFORE THAT,
WE WERE IN MANHATTAN.
AND NOW I WANT TO MOVE OUT.
YOU SEE, I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST THE GENERAL AREA.
BUT THE WOMEN IN STEPFORD
JUST SEEM TO BE
ON A DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH.
HE FEELS I'M BEING...
IRRATIONAL.
HE SAYS THERE'S
NO CERTAINTY I'D LIKE...
EASTBRIDGE OR SOMEPLACE
LIKE THAT ANY BETTER.
AND HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SPEND HIS LIFE MOVING
FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER.
YES.  UNDERSTANDABLE.
BUT STEPFORD, I KNOW,
HAS A REPUTATION
FOR BEING UNSOCIAL.
SO I ALSO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU MIGHT BE UNHAPPY THERE.
I'D BE UNHAPPY THERE.
ANY MOVE IS TRAUMATIC.
AND A CITY-TO-SUBURBS MOVE
FOR A WOMAN WITH INTERESTS
OTHER THAN PURELY FAMILY...
CAN SEEM LIKE
A JAUNT TO SIBERIA.
WHAT WOULD YOU
THINK OF IF I SAID
WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT ?
WRITERS.  ARTISTS.
NOW YOU HAVE
NO REASON TO KNOW THIS,
BUT TRURO, MASSACHUSETTS,
IS SORT OF
AN ELEPHANT'S GRAVEYARD
FOR PSYCHOANALYSTS.
PERHAPS STEPFORD IS HEAVEN
FOR THE TYPE.
ONE PERSON TELLS ANOTHER--
SOME DON'T LIKE IT AND LEAVE.
OTHERS THAT DO LIKE IT, ARRIVE.
I MEAN, WESTPORT DIDN'T
ALWAYS HAVE WRITERS.
THEY DIDN'T BREED
FROM THE ORIGINAL PAIR.
I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A VERY BRIGHT WOMAN.
WHAT DOES SURPRISE ME
IS THAT YOU HAVE COME ALL
THIS WAY TO TALK TO ME...
I THINK THE MEN
ARE BEHIND IT.
ALL OF THEM.
ALL OF THEM
IN THE ASSOCIATION.
MY HUSBAND.  EVERYONE.
THE WOMEN DON'T--
CAN'T ARRIVE IN STEPFORD
LOVING HOUSEWORK.
THEY CHANGE
ONCE THEY GET THERE.  I THINK
THE MEN MAKE THEM CHANGE.
HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT ?
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY--  THEY--
OH, JESUS !
IT'S SO AWFUL.
IF I'M WRONG,
I'M INSANE.
AND IF I'M RIGHT,
IT'S WORSE THAN IF I'M WRONG.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY DO EXACTLY.
THEY-- THEY DRAW OUR PICTURES,
AND THEY TAPE OUR VOICES...
AND THE WOMEN
ALL LOOK NEAT AND PRETTY.
THERE'S A MAN.
HE'S-- HE'S A DRUGGIST.
HE RUNS THE PHARMACY.
AND HE'S NOTHING.
HE'S NOTHING.
BUT HIS WIFE
IS JUST BREATHTAKING.
AND ONCE, BY MISTAKE,
I HAPPENED TO HEAR THEM
MAKING LOVE.
AND SHE WAS
CARRYING ON INCREDIBLY, LIKE HE
WAS SOME KIND OF GOD'S GIFT.
AND CHARMAINE
CHANGED IN FOUR MONTHS
AND RIPPED UP HER TENNIS COURT.
AND BOBBY, MY BEST FRIEND,
CHANGED IN FOUR MONTHS.
AND THAT'S WHAT CONVINCED ME.
THAT'S HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN IN STEPFORD:
FOUR MONTHS.
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
I JUST KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG,
AND MY TIME IS COMING.
YOU'RE TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED,
AREN'T YOU ?
CAN YOU SLEEP ?
WELL, THAT'S EASY.
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT.
SEE, IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BUT I HAVE TO GO AWAY
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN'T PUT OFF
AT THIS SHORT NOTICE.
NO !
I WON'T BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
DON'T YOU SEE ?
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
BEFORE THEN.  DON'T ASK ME
TO EXPLAIN IT.  I JUST KNOW.
THERE'LL BE SOMEBODY
WITH MY NAME.
AND SHE'LL COOK AND CLEAN
LIKE CRAZY, BUT SHE WON'T
TAKE PICTURES,
AND SHE WON'T BE ME.
SHE'LL--
SHE'LL-- SHE'LL BE LIKE
ONE OF THOSE ROBOTS
IN DISNEYLAND.
ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN.
I'LL GIVE YOU A PRESCRIPTION
WHICH YOU HAVE FILLED.
THEN YOU
GATHER UP YOUR CHILDREN
AND YOU GET THE HELL AWAY !
DON'T TELL YOUR HUSBAND.
DON'T TELL ANYONE.
JUST GO WHEREVER YOU FEEL SAFE.
NOW, DO YOU HAVE FAMILY ?
THEY'RE DEAD.
WELL, JUST DRIVE
AND STOP SOMEPLACE.
AND IN A FEW DAYS,
I'LL BE BACK ON THE 10th,
YOU RING ME,
I'LL COME TO YOU
AND WE'LL SORT THIS THING OUT.
NOW HOW DOES THAT SOUND ?
THEY'RE NOT HERE.
- WHERE ARE THEY ?
- I TOLD YOU.
THEY'RE NOT HERE.
THEY'RE WITH FRIENDS.
THEY'RE FINE.
AMY ?  KIM ?
WHICH FRIENDS ?
THEY'RE FINE.
HOW WAS YOUR VISIT ?
DID SHE FIX YOU UP ?
WALTER, I'M TAKING
THE CHILDREN AWAY.
WHERE ARE THEY ?
ARE THEY AT BOBBY'S ?
LOOK, LOOK, THEY'RE JUST--
THEY'RE FINE.  I TOLD YOU.
NOW, LOOK, WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET UPSET AGAIN.
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO LIE DOWN.
I WANT MY CHILDREN.
JOANNA, GO UPSTAIRS
AND LIE DOWN, NOW !
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO, YOU BASTARD !
AHH !
JOANNA !
WALTER !
OHH !
JOANNA,
OPEN THIS GODDAMN DOOR !
YOU JUST STAY IN THERE.
WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO ?
I'LL JUST STAY HOME.
WHY, LOOK AT YOU.
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.
BOBBY.  BOBBY, LISTEN.
YOU NEED A FRESH PERKED
CUP OF COFFEE.
I DON'T WANT ANY COFFEE.
I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN.
WELL, THEY'RE NOT HERE.
DAVE'S WORKING LATE,
SO I SHOOED MY BOYS
OFF WITH FRIENDS...
SO I COULD GIVE MYSELF
A CHANCE TO DO
SOME REAL CLEANING.
WHOEVER TOLD YOU
KIM AND AMY WERE HERE ?
NO ONE.  NO ONE.
BUT THE NIGHT THEY CHANGED YOU,
I KEPT YOUR KIDS.
IT JUST SEEMED LOGICAL TO ME.
CHANGED ME ?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN ?
I DON'T KNOW.  I REALLY DON'T.
BOBBY, STOP IT !
LOOK AT ME !
SAY I'M RIGHT.
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.
YOUR FIGURE'S DIFFERENT,
YOUR FACE, WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT,
ALL OF THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YES.  YES.
THIS, IT'S WONDERFUL.
WHY DON'T YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND AND HAVE A CUP ?
WHAT DOES "ARCHAIC" MEAN ?
ARCHAIC ?
I DON'T KNOW.
YES.
THINK !  YOU USED TO KNOW.
WHEN WE WENT TO MARIE AXHELM'S
AND SHE WAS IRONING,
SHE DIDN'T KNOW,
BUT YOU DID.
DID I ?
WELL, I FORGOT.
HOW DO YOU WANT IT ?
IT WASN'T ON
THE WORD LIST, WAS IT ?
THIS IS A NEW BLEND
AND VERY MILD.
LOOK, I BLEED.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU TAKE IT BLACK.
WHEN I CUT MYSELF,
I BLEED.
DO YOU BLEED ?
WHY, LOOK AT YOUR HAND.
NO, YOU LOOK.
JOANNA.
HOW COULD YOU
DO A THING LIKE THAT ?
HOW COULD YOU
DO A THING LIKE THAT ?
WHEN I WAS JUST
GOING TO GIVE YOU COFFEE.
WHEN I WAS JUST
GOING TO GIVE YOU COFFEE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I WAS JUST GOING
TO GIVE YOU COFFEE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
LISTEN, WALTER,
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
THE PHONES ARE JAMMED,
THE ALARM IS OUT...
AND THE ROADS
ARE BLOCKED OFF.
EVERYBODY'S
OUT LOOKING FOR HER.
SO DON'T PANIC.
ARE YOU OKAY ?
OKAY, LISTEN,
I'LL BE-- I'LL BE BACK.
ALL RIGHT ?
I WANT MY CHILDREN !
WHERE ARE THEY ?
WHERE ARE THEY ?
WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN ?
ASSOCIATION.
MOMMY !
MOMMY !
HELLO, JOANNA.
MOM--
QUITE A LOT OF WORRY
YOU CAUSED EVERYBODY.
WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN ?
THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU,
I KNEW YOU WERE A GOOD MOTHER.
OH, THEY'RE QUITE SAFE.
SHE WAS THRILLED
TO HAVE THEM.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE ?
OH, NO.  NO, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO NEED THAT.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL.
YOU'VE GOT QUITE THE WRONG IDEA.
JUST, UH, ANOTHER STAGE.
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THAT,
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.
WHY ?
WHY ?
BECAUSE WE CAN.
WE FOUND A WAY OF DOING IT
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.
PERFECT FOR US
AND PERFECT FOR YOU.
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD SUBJECT.
PERHAPS THE BEST WE'VE HAD.
YOU WERE BRIGHTER THAN MOST.
DO YOU MIND
IF I MAKE A CALL ?
SEE, THINK OF IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE SOME
PERFECT STUD WAITING ON YOU
AROUND THE HOUSE ?
WHISPERING HOW YOUR
SAGGING FLESH WAS BEAUTIFUL,
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOKED ?
EXCUSE ME.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
AREN'T I ALWAYS RIGHT ?
YES, I'LL TAKE IT FROM NOW.
EVERYBODY CAN GO HOME.
WELL, THAT'S ALL THERE IS.
SO WHY DON'T
WE GET IT OVER ?
YOU KNOW,
YOU HURRIED US A LITTLE.
WE WEREN'T QUITE READY
FOR YOU, IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
HI, KIT.
HOW ARE YOU ?
HELLO, MARIE ANN.
IT'S HARD.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ?
MELINDA,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
I DON'T WANT
TO SPEND MY ENTIRE DAY
IN THE SUPERMARKET.
LOOK, WE'LL GET
A NICE DINNER AT HOME.
WHY-- WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE IT A CHANCE ?
HELLO, MARIE.
HELLO, CHARMAINE.
HI, CAROL.
HI, CHARMAINE.
HELLO, CAROL.
HI, PAT.
HI, BOBBY.
HELLO, CAROL.
HOW ARE YOU ?
FINE.

HELLO, BOBBY.
HELLO, JOANNA.
HOW ARE YOU ?

HOW ARE THE CHILDREN ?

AND YOURS ?
FINE.  FINE.
