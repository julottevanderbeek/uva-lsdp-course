Dr. Barrett?
My people tell me
you're among
the best five in your field.
Your fee will be
L1 00,000.
Your assignment:
to establish the facts.
Regarding what?
Survival after death.
You want--
To know ifit's factual.
What would convinceyou
eitherway?
Give me the facts.
Where can I fi nd
these facts?
In 20 years ofstudy--
You'll fi nd them
in the only place
where survival hasn't
yet been refuted.
The Belasco House.
Hell House?
Hell House.
The Belascos sealed it up
afterwhat happened.
They need money now.
I've bought the place.
Can you be there
Monday?
Well, can you?
Yes.
There'll be two others.
Florence Tanner--
Tanner?
But she's a mental medium.
Yes. I want that
approach employed, too.
She's practically a child.
My people tell me
she's the best
in her field, too.
And the other one?
The only survivor
from the last attempt.
Fischer?
I expect an answer
within a week.
A week?
Take it or leave it.
I have a list
ofall phenomena
recorded at
the Belasco House,
restoration ofelectricity,
transportation of
your equipment.
Is that it?
No. There's a partially
constructed machine.
How long before
it's complete?
Depends on how many
electronics experts you use.
How soon
will you need it?
Wednesday.
Good day.
It would be better
ifyou didn't come.
But I always
come with you.
I don't want
to be left alone.
I want to be there
when you prove
your new theory.
Isn't itjust another
so-called haunted house?
It's the Mount Everest
ofhaunted houses.
There were two attempts
to investigate it.
Both were disasters.
Eight people died.
Fischerwas
the only survivor.
He crawled out
a mental wreck.
These are the house keys.
Your luggage
and equipment
has already
been installed.
Electricity's on.
Your rooms are ready.
There's a full larder.
I'll return
at 5:00 on the 24th.
Look at the windows.
He had them bricked up
so no one could see in.
Or out.
It's hideous.
We're not even insideyet,
Miss Tanner.
I don't have to be.
So much for electricity.
There's a generator?
Yes.
My God, that smell.
The atmosphere in here.
Ofthis world,
not the next.
This house...
it knows we're here.
Miss Tanner.
Sorry.
I'll keep my observations
to myself.
Doyou know where
the emergency generator is?
I hope
I didn't disturbyou.
It'sjust that I'm concerned
foryou coming here.
Yes, I understand.
I wonder ifyou do.
Just how wealthy
was Mr. Belasco?
I believe he left millions
when he died.
Died?
Ifthere's anything
you'd care to tell us...
What's to tell?
The house tried
to kill me.
It almost succeeded.
That leads to the cellars,
Mr. Fischer?
That's right.
What's through there?
The chapel.
Chapel?
Sorry.
I can't right now.
We understand.
Welcome tomyhouse.
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost...
Why couldn't
Miss Tanner come in?
Her system is attuned
to psychic energy.
Obviously,
it's very strong in here.
A church in hell,
that sort ofthing.
Why doesn't it
affect him?
Obviously,
he protects himself
better than she does.
Miss Tanner.
Miss Tanner?
I'm sure it's nothing.
Areyou?
Miss Tanner?
I'm over here.
You shouldn't
have done that,
Miss Tanner.
You caused us
undue alarm.
I heard a voice in here.
Welcome tomyhouse.
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost.
Believe thatduring
yourstayhere,
Ishallbe withyou
in spirit.
Mayyoufind
theansweryouseek.
Itis here, Ipromiseyou.
Andnow,
aufwiedersehen.
Aufwiedersehen.
''Till we meet again.''
The record wasn't for us.
What made
the record go on?
Belasco said
he could will people
to a particular object,
then move among them
unobserved.
I doubt that.
Doyou?
Our attention was on that
a few moments ago.
How doyou know
he didn't walk right by us?
This house hasn't lived up
to its reputation so far.
It hasn't taken
our measureyet.
Don't consider the house
the haunting force.
Quite evidently,
the problem is created
by multiple
surviving personalities.
I take ityou don't believe in
survival, Dr. Barrett.
Ifyou mean
surviving personalities,
you're correct.
We will see.
Indeed we shall.
When was
the house built?
I don't know.
Mr. Fischer?
You seem to know
a lot about Belasco.
Would you mind
sharing it with us?
His fi rst name
was Emeric.
He was born
on March 23, 1 879,
the illegitimate son
ofan American
munitions maker.
What did he look like?
His was
a frightening visage,
the face ofa demon
that had taken on
some human aspect.
Areyou quoting?
Yes, I am.
That is his second wife.
She committed suicide
in this room in 1 927.
How tall was he?
He was 6'5''.
They called him
the Roaring Giant.
What did he do
to make this house
so evil, Mr. Fischer?
Drug addiction,
alcoholism,
sadism,
bestiality,
mutilation,
murder, vampirism,
necrophilia, cannibalism,
not to mention
a gamut ofsexual goodies.
Shall I go on?
How did it end?
Ifit had ended,
we would not be here.
It's about to end,
Mr. Fischer.
What happened
to Mr. Belasco?
No one knows.
When relatives
ofthe guests
had this house
broken into in 1 929,
they found
all 27 ofthem dead.
Belasco wasn't
among them.
Ifno one objects,
I'll try a sitting tonight.
I have no objection.
Would you care to sit
in the morning,
Mr. Fischer?
I'm not readyyet.
Spirit oflove
and tenderness,
we gather here tonight
to communicate with those
who walk this house
in torment.
Help us to bridge
the chasm ofdeath
so faithfully
that pain is transformed
intojoy,
sorrow into peace.
All this we ask
in the name
ofour Infi nite Father.
Amen.
This is an evil house,
a place ofsickness.
Evil!
Extremes.
Limits.
Terminations
and extremities.
I don't know.
''Ifthine eye offend thee...''
Yes.
Yes.
There is a young man.
Veryyoung.
Says he must speak.
Must speak.
I don't knowyou people.
Why areyou here?
It does no good.
Nothing changes.
Nothing.
Get out or I'll hurtyou.
I can't help myself.
God damn you,
you fi lthy sons ofbitches.
God damn you!
I don't want to hurtyou,
but I must, I must.
Get out ofthis house
before I kill you all!
You started manifesting
physical phenomena.
But I'm not
a physical medium.
You werejust now.
The embryo ofone.
I don't understand.
All this time
a mental medium,
and now this.
The Lord certainly
does move
in mysterious ways.
So does this house.
Back to normal.
Those pounding noises
are a bit unnerving
the fi rst time
you hear them.
Whywas Miss Tanner
so disturbed by that sitting?
Because she caused
physical phenomena.
If Miss Tanner
is a mental medium
and Mr. Fischer
a physical medium,
how can you be sure she created
those noises, not Fischer?
I can't.
In fact, I'm not at all sure
about Mr. Fischer
or Miss Tanner.
Who is it, please?
You want
to speak to me?
Areyou the one
that warned us
to get out?
Yes, it is you, isn't it?
You must give me
some sign.
You're not Belasco,
areyou?
Such a pain
would not be in Belasco.
I feel your anguish.
Who areyou?
Daniel?
Daniel Belasco.
Very clever.
Ifyou're that clever,
why areyou still
a prisoner in this house?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You slept well?
Fine. And you?
Yes, verywell, thankyou.
I think I have
a partial answer
to the haunting, Doctor.
Thatyoung man that
warned us during the sitting
came to my room last night.
Belasco's son.
Yes.
Daniel Belasco.
He's veryyoung
and frightened.
Because he's
so frightened,
he's very hostile.
IfI convince him
to move on,
the haunting force
will be eliminated.
Do so by all means.
I'd like to suggest
another sitting,
under scientific
conditions this time.
Miss Tanner
in apparent trance.
Pulse rate 85,
respiration 1 5.
Four electric contacts
maintained.
No change in temperature.
Steady at 73.2.
Dynamometer reading
decreased to 1 823 now.
Temperature lowering.
Now it's 69.6 degrees.
Pulse rate 94.5
and rising.
Temperature drop
now 1 2.3 degrees.
Dynamometer reading
reduced to 1 779.
Pressurometer negative.
Electric contacts
still maintained.
Rate ofbreath increasing.
Rising steadily.
Infrared rays broken.
Cameras activated.
Evidence ofelectromagnetic
radiation commencing.
Medium's respiration 21 0.
Dynamometer 1 460.
Temperature...
Evidence ofozone
in the air.
Ectoplasm forming.
Separate fi laments exuding
from fi ngertips ofboth hands
uniting to form
two separate strands.
Two strands moving
toward each other.
Ectoplasmic stalk through net,
moving toward table.
Leave a sample, please.
Leave a sample in thejar.
Aah!
Aah!
Hold it.
She's all right.
Miss Tanner
coming out oftrance.
Premature retraction
ofectoplasm
causing brief
systemic shock.
Conclusion ofsitting,
I spoiled your sitting,
didn't I?
Not at all.
I couldn't be
more satisfied.
Take a look.
What is it?
A specimen ofthat teleplasm
prepared in water.
What the spiritualists
refer to as ectoplasm
is derived almost entirely
from the medium's body,
the remainder
being admixtures
from the air,
the medium's costume,
fi brous remains,
dust particles.
But the bulk is
organic living matter,
an organic externalization
ofthought--
Mind reduced to matter.
She made that figure
from herself?
I was visited
by Belasco's son
again this afternoon.
Wereyou?
Will it never end?
Will what never end?
Your attitude ofdoubt
and distrust.
Why should mediums
be expected to perform
only under conditions
that science dictates?
We're not machines!
I'm not a medium for fun.
Doyou think--
I believe mediumship
is God's manifestation
in man.
''When I speak to thee,
I will open thy mouth
''and thou shalt say
unto thee,
thus saith the Lord. ''
There's nothing
in the Bible
that doesn't occur today,
be it sights or sounds,
coming through
closed doors,
Levitations,
or the speaking
in tongues!
Miss Tanner,
I don't know
what this is about.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh!
No!
Mr. Fischer, you must go.
What doyou mean?
You know.
You're the physical medium.
You're being used.
You're not in control.
You've got to leave!
Trying to get rid
ofus both now?
What doyou mean?
Doctor, what doyou mean?
I would have thought
that was obvious.
What is he saying?
That I'm responsible?
You're the one who should
leave this house.
You're the one
who's being used,
not me.
Do we have to stay?
This is important to me.
What ifyou're hurt again?
I won't be.
I'll see to it!
Surelyyou noticed
how it all ended
with a word from her,
how I was the only one
who was attacked.
I angered her.
You think Miss Tanner
was responsible?
Not unassisted.
There's a lot ofpower
in this house, Ann.
She was the one
who used it, though.
Directed it at me.
I made a mistake.
I accepted quiet,
polite behavior toward me
at face value.
You can't do that
with a medium.
You never know
what's underneath.
May I speak toyou?
I'll only be a moment.
Wereyou badly hurt?
I'll manage.
I know what happened
now, Doctor.
It was Belasco's son.
He's trying to separate us.
We're less ofa challenge
that way.
I'll sit foryou tomorrow.
There'll be
no further sittings.
You can't
stop them now!
I'm doing so.
You don't think
I did all that?
I know it!
Please.
I'm in considerable pain.
Doctor,
I am not responsible.
It was Belasco's son.
Miss Tanner!
There is no such person.
You're wrong.
Lionel?
Lionel!
Lionel!
Where areyou
going now?
To look for something.
Proofthat
Belasco's son existed?
I'm sorry ifI
insulted you before.
Mrs. Barrett.
Mrs. Barrett!
You...
me...
that girl...
Lionel...
all together...
naked...
drunk...
clutching...
sweating...
biting...
Aah!
You...
You were walking
in your sleep.
Mrs. Barrett.
Daniel, I've found you.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What is it?
What happened?
Daniel Belasco.
I've found him.
Well, I'm not
imagining it.
He attacked me.
Did I imagine this?
He's in there
behind the wall.
'Ashes toashes,
dust to dust.
''OLord,
we beseech Thee
''mercifully toreceive
''theprayers
ofThypeople
''andgrant that
theymayknow
that which they
ought to do. ''
Florence.
Florence.
Is thatyou?
Help me, Florence.
Why? Why?
You should have gone on.
You're my onlyhope.
Your bodywas buried.
I prayed foryou.
Please, Florence.
No. You have to go.
You've been given
your release.
Youare my onlyhope.
You must go on.
Youare my onlyhope,
Florence.
What does he want?
No. I can't.
Please, Florence.
No. I can't.
No!
What in the name
ofGod?
Aah!
Oh!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Florence.
Florence.
Doctor.
Miss Tanner's
been hurt again.
Where is she?
She's in her room.
She's been bitten
and scratched.
How did it happen?
I don't know.
A cat, I think.
A cat?
It was possessed
by Daniel Belasco.
Would you like me
to examineyou?
This will prevent infection.
I'm all right.
I knowyou think--
It doesn't matter
what I think.
What matters is
your being mauled.
I'm all right.
I wonder ifthat is so.
Shouldn'tyou leave?
No! I'm not leaving now.
I'd be failing in my duty
ifI didn't
warn you to leave.
I don't wantyou
to be anothervictim
of Hell House.
He's right, you know.
You should leave.
You're being torn
to pieces.
You don't think
I'm doing this to myself?
Ofcourse I don't.
You say
it's Daniel Belasco,
but what if
you're wrong?
What if
you're being fooled?
Fooled?
Daniel Belasco does exist.
We found his body.
We laid him to rest.
Why is he not at rest?
I think I know.
Controlled
multiple haunting.
Something unique
in haunted houses.
A surviving will
so powerful
that he can use
that power to dominate
all other
surviving sources.
You mean
Emeric Belasco?
He's the one that's
kept me from the chapel.
He made it seem as if
Daniel possessed the cat.
He's the one that's keeping
Daniel's soul imprisoned here.
He's like a general
with his army--
Never entering the battle,
but always controlling it.
Just what haveyou
been doing,
Mr. Fischer?
Hmm?
Haveyou been drinking?
I don't think that's
any ofyour business,
although I do think
it's a very good idea.
Come on.
No.
You come on.
Mrs. Barrett.
Yes...Ben?
You should not leave
your husband alone.
Oh, I think he's all right.
He's sleeping.
Mrs. Barrett,
you must go back upstairs.
Did you know that this was
where it all happened?
Where all what happened?
All that debauchery
and vice.
Right here.
Right around
this very table.
Mrs. Barrett,
you don't know
whatyou're saying.
Oh, yes, I do.
I know exactly
what I'm saying,
Mr. Fischer.
Mr. B.F. Fischer.
Mrs. Barrett,
it's this house.
It's making you--
This house isn't
doing anything.
I'm doing it.
Touch me,
or I'll fi nd
somebodywho will!
No!
No!
Oh.
I knowyou won't
forgive me...now.
I know what I did.
I'd give anything
to undo it.
I just don't know
why I went down those stairs.
I knew what I was doing.
I knew,
but at the same time...
I'm not asking you
to forgive me,
but please, please
don't hate me.
I need you.
I loveyou.
I just don't understand
what's happening to me.
I just don't understand.
It's all right.
It'll pass after
we've left this house.
I loveyou, too.
Doctor, I think
yourwife is in danger.
Mr. Fischer.
It was not her fault.
Please, Mr. Fischer.
This is a matter
oflife and death.
She walked down here
last night.
When?
Near midnight.
You were asleep.
So was she.
She walked in her sleep?
Yes.
You should have told me.
No, Doctor.
She should have.
The fact that she didn't...
I don't thinkyou know
what's going on
in this house.
What I think
is irrelevant.
What the hell doyou mean
by irrelevant?
Whatever is getting
atyourwife
has already gotten
to Miss Tanner and toyou.
You're blocking yourselfoff
completely.
Mr. Deutsch is wasting
a third ofhis money.
You're blockingyourselfoff
completely.
Blockingyourselfoff
completely.
Iam notblocking anything.
I'mjustnot
sticking myneck out
the way Ididin 1953.
Aaah!
Aaaaaaahhh!
Uh!
Uh!
Uh!
Eee!
Ben? I've been think--
Give up.
Give up?
What's happened?
I thought
we trusted each other.
I don't trust anyone
or anything.
Anyone who does
in this house is a fool.
Something has happened.
Lots ofthings.
Nothing we can't handle.
Wrong.
There is nothing
in this house
that we can handle.
That's not true.
We've made
wonderful progress.
Toward what?
Our graves?
Daniel and the way
Belasco works.
Daniel!
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!
How doyou know
he ever existed?
The body.
How doyou know
that he isn't
a figment
ofyour imagination?
How doyou know
his personality
isn't what you
made ofit ?
I know I'm right.
We knew we were right
in 1 953.
Grace Lauter,
a successful medium for--
For 20 years.
Shejumped off
the balcony,
and she shattered
both her legs.
Dr. Graham...
physicist.
He crawled out
ofthis house...
to die.
Professor Rand,
head of
the chemistry department
at the University
ofOxford...
paralyzed.
Professor Fenley...
psychic investigator...
crippled and insane
to this day.
Yes, uh...
You're right.
I am obstructing.
You're quite right.
I'm shut off.
I am going
to stay shut off
until I am far away
from this place.
I am going
to collect my L1 00,000,
and I am never
going to come
within 1 ,000 miles
ofthis house
for as long as I live,
and I suggest
you do the same.
Ben.
Huh!
Aah!
Can I do anything
to help?
I'm afraid not.
It'sjust
too complicated.
Thanks all the same.
What's it going to do,
Lionel?
You've heard me talk
about a power
in this house.
It's a real power, Ann,
a field of
measurable energy.
Energy that can be
reversed.
That's what
I'm going to do.
By this time tomorrow,
Hell House
will be de-energized.
You'll see.
That pile ofjunk
you have
isn't going to do
a thing.
Get her out ofhere!
You haven't a chance.
Have you?
Yes. I know the score.
You do not fight
this house!
Hell House doesn't
mind a guest.
What it doesn't like
is people who attack it.
Belasco doesn't like it.
His people
will fight back,
and they'll kill you.
Leave that machine alone.
When Sunday comes,
tell old Deutsch anything
and bank the money.
Ifyou try anything else,
you will be
a dead man.
He won't listen, will he?
I was the only one
to get out ofhere
alive and sane in 1 953.
I will be the only one
to make it out this time.
He's wrong.
I told you before,
what Florence Tanner
believes is wrong.
I'm telling you now
that Fischer
is equallywrong.
Tomorrow,
it will be proved.
Florence.
Florence.
Help me.
Please.
Please...
help me.
Love me.
Florence.
Florence.
Don'tgo, Florence.
Help me.
Florence, help me.
Help me, Florence.
Help me, Florence.
Florence.
Daniel,
you must understand.
Whatyou ask
is impossible.
I can't.
I believe in you.
I've opened
my heart toyou.
Please, help me.
Please, love me.
Florence.
Love me.
No.
No.
Please, help me.
Florence.
Please...
help me.
Love me.
Dear God...
reach down Your hand
and give me
Your protection.
Help me this night
to bring to Your care
the tortured soul
of Daniel Belasco.
I giveyou now
the loveyou've never known.
I give it soyou will
gain strength
to leave this house.
Iloveyou.
And I loveyou.
With love, please,
with love.
Hah!
Oh.
Ah.
Oh.
Oh.
Florence.
Aaahh!
Aaaaahhh!
Mm hm hm!
Florence.
How long
haveyou been here?
All night.
There?
Stupid.
You could have
slept with me.
Who put on
my nightdress?
Mrs. Barrett.
Why didn'tyou do it?
My God.
He's inside me.
He lied to me.
He said it was
the onlyway.
But he's inside me!
I can feel him
just waiting in there
to take over.
It will be all right.
I will takeyou
out ofhere.
He won't let me go.
He can't stopyou.
He can.
He can't stop me.
Who doyou thinkyou are,
you bastard?
You might have been
hot stuff before,
but nowyou're shit!
Dear God, help me.
I'm taking her away.
How areyou,
Miss Tanner?
I'm all right.
You needn't come back,
Mr. Fischer.
The house will be clear.
Clear?
How?
There isn't time
for explanation.
Yes, there is.
Florence.
I am not leaving
until I know.
All right.
The body emits
a form ofenergy
invisible
to the human eye.
This energy
can be expanded
far beyond the body,
where it can create
mechanical, chemical,
physical effects,
sounds, moving objects
like we've experieced.
The energy I talk about
is a field of
electromagnetic radiation.
E.M.R.
Exactly.
All living organisms
emit this energy.
Such power must saturate
its environment.
Is it anywonder
that Hell House
is the way it is?
Consider the mental
and physical energy
which is being poured
into its interior.
The house
is a giant battery,
the residual energy
ofwhich
must be tapped.
We survive with this energy
after death.
No, Miss Tanner.
This residue
has nothing to do
with surviving
personalities.
The spirit
of Emeric Belasco
does not prowl
this house.
Neither does his son
or any other entities
thatyou believeyourself
to be in contact with.
There is one thing
and one thing only
in this house--
mindless,
directionless power.
You're wrong, Dr. Barrett.
You cannot
destroy a spirit.
All you will do is send it
to another hell.
No, Miss Tanner.
I'm right.
My machine
will fi ll the house
with a massive
countercharge
ofelectromagnetic
radiation,
opposing the polarity
ofthe atmosphere,
reversing,
and dissipating it.
And Hell House
will be exorcised.
I see.
Well, there's nothing else
to do then.
Barrett.
Ah!
Thank God she didn't
know what to smash.
I should be flattered.
Her attack
on the reverser
was her ultimate tribute.
She knows I'm right.
There was
nothing else to do.
That's what she said.
She had to destroy
my beliefs
before they
destroyed hers.
Daniel?
Aah!
No!
Aah!
No!
Aaahh!
Florence.
Daniel, you must leave
before it's too late.
Soon you'll be sent
from this hell to another.
Aah!
Where is Miss Tanner?
She was lying
over there.
Why didn'tyou
watch her?
Ah! Oh!
Florence.
You tricked me.
God help me,
you tricked us all.
Ha haha!
Ah!
Quickly.
You'll have to open yourself
to it, Mr. Fischer.
Try, Mr. Fischer.
I guarantee
there'll be no trouble.
Well?
He's startled because
there's nothing to pick up.
Is it really over, Lionel?
Yes. It's over.
Done with, fi nished.
I can't believe it.
I know.
Doyou mind ifI say
I told you so?
What a pity
Miss Tanner died
when the answer
was so close.
Barrett.
Barrett,
the house is clear.
It is completely clear!
And I called that machine
a pile ofjunk.
You better go
and get some rest.
I want to check
my readings.
This is impossible.
I don't accept this.
I do not accept this!
Lionel?
Lionel.
Lionel!
In here.
Lionel?
Here.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No!
I'm sorry.
Lionel.
Oh, please get me
out ofhere.
Please.
I'm not leaving.
I'm going back
to the chapel.
No. No, you can't.
You don't know
what it's like in there.
I have to.
You don't.
There is no reason
to go back there.
None.
Ann, listen.
I have to.
It's for Florence.
It's foryour husband.
IfI leave
Hell House now,
mywhole life
will be a failure.
You can't solve it.
It cannot be solved.
You're going to die...
like Lionel,
like Miss Tanner.
Then I will.
It's here.
The entire house is clear
except for
this one place.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Belasco.
That's what the '' B''
inside the circle means.
She was trying
to tell us
that it was only
Belasco all along.
It isn't mindless,
directionless power.
It isn't
multiple hauntings.
It's only one.
One entity pretending
to be Daniel.
One entity pretending
to be many others.
That's where
the answer lies.
But what's the key?
What is the key?
Extremes andlimits.
Terminations andextremities.
Oh.
Oh, God.
Ofcourse.
That's what she meant.
Extremes.
Limits.
Legs.
Grace Lauter's spine
and legs shattered.
Dr. Graham crawling.
Professor Rand, paralyzed.
Professor Fenley, crippled.
Florence's legs crushed.
Your husband's...
''Ifthine eye
offendthee... ''
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Belasco!
Whateveryou do,
do not interfere.
Belasco.
Here I am.
Destroy me ifyou can.
Don't leave thejob
halfdone.
We're here.
I'm here!
Kill me!
That's it.
Oh, that's it.
Tell me something,
Belasco.
Why didn'tyou ever
leave this house
when you were alive?
Why did you despise
the sunlight?
Was it better hiding
in the shadows?
No one...
No one could really
seeyou then,
could they?
No one could fi nd out
your secret then,
could they?
You weren't a genius!
You were a deviate!
A sawed-off
little bastard!
Your motherwas a bitch!
A whore!
You were a bastard!
A funny little
dried-up bastard!
You're no genius!
You're no Roaring Giant!
What size wereyou,
Belasco?
I knowyou weren't even
Aah!
Emeric Belasco.
The Roaring Giant.
Is it clear?
This is a special moment.
Meet Emeric Belasco.
Your husband did have
part ofthe answer.
Florence had
part ofit, too.
I fi nally found
the last part,
that which
Belasco's giant ego
could not face.
He so despised
his own shortness
that he cut off his legs
and wore those instead
to give himselfheight.
''Ifthine eye offend thee,
pluck it out.''
Maybe he was a genius
after all.
Just because a man
preserves his body
doesn't make him
a genius.
It's not his body
ofwhich I'm speaking.
This is why
your husband's machine
could not destroy
his power.
These walls
are sheathed with lead.
He built himself
a fortress
to protect his spirit.
He knew what was coming
years before it came.
Your husband
and Florence
helped us
to rid this house
of Belasco.
Let us hope
that their spirits
guide him
to everlasting peace.
Belasco.
