It deceived the inhabitants
of the earth...
And forced all people to receive
a mark on their right hands,
I know your type. You act tough,
but you just want to fall in love.
You have a funny nose.
- What does that mean?
- Mm, I don't know.
It's like a weird shape.
- Our babies would have funny noses.
-
Have you thought about
what I told you?
About my Uncle?
I just have to play some
dumb game with him, right?
Yeah.
Are you gonna come with me?
I can take you there, but you
have to play the game by yourself.
Those are the rules.
Okay.
Hey.
One second.
Hey, Mike. This is the
girl I told you about.
She's on vacation. I think...
No, she doesn't know anything.
She doesn't know.
- Really? Nothing?
- No, she doesn't know anything.
- No, no, no, no, no.
-
-
-
So, all you have to is play the game.
- That's it.
- He's not a pervert, right?
You'd like that.
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
- It's $500.
You said you don't
think it's real, right?
You remember what
you said to me last night?
Say it again.
I love you.
Put your hand in there and pick one.
Go ahead.
- Three times to see if you're special.
-  Right.
Choose one.
Nice.
Last time.
He's chosen you.
- Don't touch.
-
Now, I'll give you this
if you go down to where the
roads meet and say your name.
Why?
So he knows your name
when he calls for you.
See, you're the vessel, the bridge
around for the left-hand path.
And one day, he will come.
You'll be perfect.
Yeah.
Yeah. And he has
these cute little freckles.
He's adorable, and his hair
is exactly... his hair is exactly
what you would expect someone
from California to have for hair.
Lori, I swear I didn't sleep with him,
but I still want him to be my first.
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see him again.
No, I know. I know. You have to go.
Okay.
No, um, my parents are at choir.
Okay.
Bye.
Come to me.
-

Prices continue to shrink
over the past two decades,
more and more families
are slipping into poverty.
People once with a guarantee
of good jobs and schools
and benefits are struggling
to make ends meet...
Where police are blocking the
ramp because of an action
involving a gunman held
up inside his house
rain is forecast in the next
Safety net is guaranteed,
as long as they worked hard.
They wanted their kids to do better.
Well, this is doing better.
Vera. It's Sunday.
Yeah. It's morning.
- I always get lost coming here.
- Still?
It's your fault.
You're always moving.
Oh, my God, these are so adorable.
Thank you for making these.
I look like such a spaz in that one.
What are you talking about?
Look. We're perfect.
Oh, but this...
- It's still my favorite.
- You can have it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I hate looking at the stuff I did as a
teenager. It's like someone else made it.
Oh, uh...
He's here.
- Hi. Um, I'm Vera's sister.
- Hey. Sorry. I'm sorry.
You don't...
You don't sound like her.
Um, I wasn't born here. She was.
Oh.
Well, you both must have had a
very pretty mom, for sure. Right?
Our parents are dead.
Don't you take it
away from my heart
-
Nice, Vera.
He's cute.
-
- Hey.
Yeah, I can go see a property now.
Is it a foreclosure?
-
- It's not? Okay, good. How far is it?
No, no, no, I can go.
I want this. Thank you.
Uh, no. Come on. Just consider
it an early birthday present.
- Come on. I want to pay for your work.
- No, really, it's fine.
I'm gonna make money at my
show this week, anyway.
I know, honey,
but I want to pay for them.
Okay.
I'm so proud of you.
I'll see you later, okay?
Hey.
Hey, I'm... I'm just here
to look at the house.
My parents moved to this country for
a better life, and I still believe in that.
I know I can get you a
great price on your house,
even with all the bad news out there.
So, let me tell you a bit about who I am.
I've been an agent for five years.
I love putting people in homes
because it offers families an
opportunity for something better.
- I work every day, evenings, too.
- That's great.
That's perfect, just...
just exactly what we're looking for.
Um, we... we do want to sell
this house, um, and I think, uh,
Leigh... I think you're the person
to do it. I think you'll be great.
Uh, we do want to get it on
the market as soon as possible,
um, by the end of the week,
if you could do it.
Of this week.
Um...  I'll try.
Okay. Uh, there's something else
I-I supposed we should talk about.
It's a little difficult,
but we've been negligent on the
mortgage the last few months.
It's just really been hard.
I got laid off. We have to sell it.
You know, one day we're
gonna get back on our feet,
and we'll probably buy another house
and m-maybe even buy it from you.
I mean, let's get your home sold.
There is some furniture in there.
Are you gonna remove it?
No. When we bought the
house back in, uh... '89?
- '88.
- '88.
Yeah.
That furniture was in there, and we don't
need it anymore, so we'll just leave it.
Okay. And, uh,
I saw there was a fire.
Yes, there was a fire. That happened
one night while we were out.
Uh, but really no damage,
uh, mostly cosmetic.
Yeah.
One of my jobs is
listing disclosures,
anything that's wrong with the house,
anything that can raise a flag to buyers.
I understand. Uh, so, everything's fine.
We'll get you a list of disclosures.
I mean, we love this house.
We... we didn't want to have to sell it.
We raised our daughter there.
I think she stopped by this morning.
- Charlene? Petite, short hair...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You saw her?
Yeah.
Our daughter ran off with a
boyfriend a couple months ago.
Oh.
So, you saw her at the house.
What was she doing there?
Um, I don't know.
She came in when I was there.
And she ran off when
I tried to talk to her.
Yeah. Uh, you know what?
I'm sorry to have to do this.
I-I think we've got
to talk to the police.
- We've been looking for her.
- I understand.
You know, she's a great kid,
and then just something happened.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm so sorry.
Um, I'll schedule an inspection,
with your permission?
Absolutely. Let's do that
as soon as possible, okay?
We'll get you those
disclosures tomorrow.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Bye.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
- I'm not...
-
Through all this, Jonah sleeps.
He doesn't see the enraging sea
or the far rush of the mighty whale.
Then at last a frightened
sailor comes to him
and screams in his ear,
"oh, sleeper, arise."
And, startled,
Jonah staggers to his feet...
-
-
Leigh, line 4.
Another foreclosure went up.
You want to take this one?
I'm sorry. I-I don't think
I'm gonna get that.
Whoa.
-
-
- Hello?
- Fairfield security.
- Your pin code, please?
- Yes, um, 1512.
Is everything okay?
Would you like assistance?
Yes, please. Send someone right now.
- We'll be there shortly.
- Thank you.
Shit.
-
- Hey.
Hey, Vera. Um, honey, I'm so sorry.
- I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
- It's fine.
I'm stuck in this inspection.
But as soon as it's done,
I'm gonna be right over, okay?
Okay. It's totally fine.
I know it's fine,
but it's your night.
It's your opening, so I just...
I don't know. I just want to be there.
Look, it really doesn't matter, okay?
The show's gonna stay up,
and this is a pretty lame party.
Well, at least...
- Did that boy show up?
- Stop.
- What? He seemed so nice.
- No, no, no. I know where this is going.
Don't make believe you're
not looking for someone.
No, I'm not, Leigh. For the
hundredth time, I'm not like you.
I'm never gonna get married and I'm
never gonna have a perfect little house
and I'm never gonna have
perfect little kids, all right?
Right. You're never gonna have kids.
- Well, who's going to, then?
-  I didn't mean it like that.
Not me. Not my own.
Leigh, did you see another doctor?
No, I just...
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm... I know I'm
a little crazy. I just...
I feel really alone sometimes.
I know you don't understand anything
that I'm talking about right now, but...
I love you.
I love you very much.
- And I'm gonna be there tonight, okay?
- Okay.
Well... I'll see you soon.
Yeah.
-
- Shit.
Hey.
Charlene?
Wait.
Charlene?
Charlene.
I talked to your mom and dad.
They're worried about you.
Let me help you.
You're lucky I keep this in my car.
I left a message for your parents.
-
- Is that why you came back?
To get the money?
That's my sister... Vera.
She's an artist.
She's a special person...
Kind of dark.
I just want her to find
someone and have kids.
Excuse me.
It's Vera. Leave me a message.
Vera, I'm so sorry I've
been so held up here.
I'm still in Greenville.
There's a girl who I think has
been living here. She's with me.
There's something wrong with her.
I-I'll tell you more later. I love you.
- Hello?
- Yeah. Hey. It's Chuck.
- We saw that you called.
- Hi, uh, Chuck. This is, uh, Leigh.
- I'm with Charlene.
- Uh... I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Charlene, your daughter.
The police picked Charlene up a couple
hours ago at a shopping center in Marion.
But she's right here in your house.
Well, I'm looking at her right now.
I mean, I know my own daughter.
Are you there?
- I'm sorry. I-I'll call you back.
-
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
You're not the one I want.
Green's played his best...
Honey?
Why haven't you left yet, sweetie?
Honey, you're gonna
be late for babysitting.
Is everything okay?
They're expecting you at 8:00.
Oh, hey. Oh, hey, come on in.
Yeah.
Becky's feeding Lucilla right now.
They're down the hall, to the right.
Hi.
Here she is.
Sometimes it slips inside me.
Uh, what?
So, they're talking 35 square foot
for the units. There's only 12 units.
- I'm thinking, "I can't make that deal."
-
Am I wrong? It's like,
"This is... This is wholesale.
You're... that's retail, man.
Take it to the shopping mall.
- I-I can't deal with that."
- Yeah, it's...
Oh, looking a little light, sweetie.
- Can I, uh, refill?
- Yes.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Be right back.
-
Wh...
What's the... What's...
what's the matter?
Where's Lucilla?
Where is she? Hey! Where's my baby?
Your fucking baby's dead.
You're all dead.
Baby, oh, no.
She's not here! She's not here,
Davis! Oh, my God!
-
- Oh, God, she's upstairs!
She's upstairs! She's upstairs!
Oh, my God!
Wait.
Where's my baby?
Okay.
- Hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna lift on top.
- She's right here. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
-
- Oh, my baby!
It's okay, honey.
Our father who are in heaven,
hallowed be thy name. Thy...
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name. Thy...
Thy...
-
-
Hi!
-  Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Good to see you.
- Hey.
- Oh.
- Hey. How's it going?
- Good. How are you?
Good. Congrats.
- Thank you.
- It's amazing. This is amazing stuff.
Um, you gonna... you gonna
go out tonight after this?
Mm-hmm.
Um, well, you know, I'd... I'd really
like to hang out another time.
Listen, Sam, thank you so much
for coming, but I don't think so.
Um. Really?
Look, yeah, I-I just...
I think of you up there in
that loft all alone, and...
I don't know. I thought you
might want some company.
We all need a little
company sometimes.
Right?
No. I don't.
Vera...
It's looking for a home.
Hello?
Yes. I'm her sister.
Your sister's heart simply stopped.
There are many possible reasons.
Hypertension, unexpected stress.
It could have been genetic.
She was 29.
There's no signs of, uh,
malice or foul play.
There's no evidence of a struggle
or that anyone else was there.
She died of heart failure.
You're the only kin, right?
I'm gonna give you the
address of the, uh,
impound yard where
you can find her car.
Hey. It's me.
Look, I was thinking.
I feel bad about fighting.
And I know that family
is important to you,
and sometimes I don't say
"I love you" back, so...
I love you. Okay. I'll see you.
Vera, I'm so sorry I've
been so held up here.
I'm still in Greenville.
There's a girl who I think has
been living here. She's with me.
There's something wrong with her.
- I-I'll tell you more later. I love you.
-
-
- Hello?
Come to me.
Hey.
Hey, wait!
-
- Hey!
My sister thought she
saw you in that house.
I haven't been there in months.
I talked to your parents, and they told
me that you asked to be put in here.
Yeah. It's safer.
What are you scared of?
- That house.
-
The girl in the red raincoat.
I want to know everything
you know about her.
When I was about 13 or 14,
I'm sure I saw her.
I was playing in my backyard, and I looked
through a window into my parents room,
and I saw that girl standing there.
But I went in there,
and no one was there.
So, all you ever saw was
this girl in the raincoat?
Well, like a year ago, I switched
rooms with my parents because I...
I said I liked the
view of the backyard,
but really it was just so that
my boyfriend, Gus, could...
sneak in through
the window at night.
One night, we were...
doing it. And, um, I looked up
and there was somebody standing
there in the mirror, watching us.
The girl?
No. No. It was a man.
I mean, he was just standing over us,
and he was... he was all dark.
After that, I had to get
out of there.
Your parents told Leigh that
you lit the fire in the house.
She had that in her notes.
I didn't light that fire.
Who did?
Well, ever since I touched the burned
wall in your house, this won't wash off.
You know how you might
find out what's happening?
Go find the girl next
to her, her friend.
I remember that article because
of that photo. My dad took it.
So, you said you saw her?
Yeah.
It was a tragedy, what happened
to Hannah. She had a good heart.
If she had lived, she would have
had kids and lived in the suburbs,
despite all her acting out back then.
We were good friends. I miss her.
What about her suicide?
What happened?
After I saw what
happened with Hannah,
it opened my eyes that there
are bad things in this world.
There was a boy.
And she met him when she
went out to visit California.
I want to be with you forever.
She told me this boy had talked
her into selling her soul.
I want you to go down to where
the roads meet and say your name.
So he knows your name
when he calls for you.
Hannah.
After she came back home,
she said someone was coming for her.
And then when she looked in the
mirror sometimes, she would see him,
and...
That he could get inside her.
And she said to me,
"he wants to be all of someone."
I will never forget that.
Did you believe her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
That's why her parents thought
that she killed herself.
They found a pregnancy test and thought
she panicked and went crazy because of it.
But Hannah told me something
she never told anybody else.
She told me...
she was a virgin.
I think Hannah killed herself
before whatever was happening to her
had a chance to finish what it was doing.
And I think that whatever you saw
or maybe your sister saw wasn't her.
I think it was whatever
had gotten inside of her,
and I think it was wearing
her like a costume.
He wants to be all of someone?
What does that mean?
Maybe the best thing you can do is
get as far away from this as possible.
Mom, I'm done!
Do you want to wait?
No. Thank you.
I'm... I'm gonna go.
Thank you, though.
Hi, honey.
You get all clean in there?
- Yeah.
- Oh. Hi!
I was lost, and there was
a princess. There were...
-
-
Vera...
You've been in a coma
for eight months.
You fell two stories,
you broke several bones,
and your brain suffered some trauma.
Now, we don't want you
to try speaking too much
until the speech
therapist comes on Monday.
Today's Saturday.
Do you understand?
Do you remember, you were
pregnant when it happened?
Yeah.
And you were pregnant the
night they brought you in.
Were you aware of that?
There's the head, the arms,
and the heart.
- Easy, easy, easy. Easy. It's okay.
-
- Get that out of me!
- Calm down.
Get that thing out of me.
I want it out.
I can arrange for you to talk
to someone about adoption,
but you have to accept you're
gonna deliver this baby.
No. Then I want a c-section.
Immediately.
Sponge.
I can feel something.
- What do you feel?
-  I don't know.
It's okay to feel a kind of
pressure as we're working.
Vera, would you like to see?
Beautiful.
Would you like to hold your baby?
No.
Now, this is new video
just coming in to us.
This is incredible footage of the
devastation brought by this Tsunami.
We are getting reports it is over
One can only assume there are tens
of thousands of people displaced,
this once thriving neighborhood,
as you can see, entirely underwater.
Nearby wreckage of a once
middle-class community.
As you can see here, gas lines
have been reported ruptured.
In some areas, fires are
still raging out of control.
-
- You really shouldn't be watching that.
Oh, for the wonder
of Christmas time
Hey, baby, you're gonna have
that visitor in a few minutes.
I guess she's driven a long way to meet
you, so I want you to be extra nice.
-
I'm starting your mac and cheese.
They're expecting a
wonderful christmastime
And doing their best, but looking at
these images, one can only guess...
- Come in. She's in the kitchen.
-
I'll introduce you to her and
leave you alone for a while.
Honey, this lady's name is Vera.
She came a long way because
she wanted to meet you.
She's just real shy.
- You want some tea?
- Yes. Thank you.
Just holler if you need me.
I'm gonna go pick up your room.
Do you know who I am?
I'm your mother.
They told me I was crazy.
Put me on all these meds,
said that I imagined things
and that's why I gave you up.
I know about Hannah.
I know she made a deal.
After she killed herself,
you had nowhere to go.
So you waited around for someone
else that you could get inside of.
You killed my sister.
Then you chose me.
Why did you choose me?
I know who you are.
Come to me.
-
-
- No!
-
Baby?
Baby?
Baby?!
I knew you'd come back for me, mommy.
It deceived the inhabitants
of the earth...
And forced all people to receive
a mark on their right hands,
