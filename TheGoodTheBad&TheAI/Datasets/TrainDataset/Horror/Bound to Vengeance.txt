and in the dark ¶

¶ Union men came riding
to the door ¶
¶ Left a man with fire
all around ¶
¶ His wife and son
left buried in the ground ¶
¶ You can ride on
till you get old ¶
¶ It'll hunt you down
and nail you to the road ¶

¶ But not the winter
of your broken heart ¶
¶ And the seas
will roil and turn ¶
¶ Just like your soul.. ¶

Ah!
- Sorry, I couldn't get here

You -- you didn't die

Poor sick little puppy.
I cooked the soup

It's all for you.
There's no reason to share

Come here.
Eve, Eve, listen to me. Wait.

Come on.
Please!
No!
Fuck!

Why am I doing this?
-
I got ya.
- Keys.
-
-
Yes. Yes, I love you.
-
- Alright, no, no, no,
I'm not answering that.
-
- Now what?
Coming back to apologize?
-
-
-
-
- Tell me where they are.
- Why would I do that?
- Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.
-
...then you're killing
all the rest of them.
You didn't think about that.
-
-
Just like you did before.
Remember over there
in the corner?
Go ahead.
End it right here.
Kill them.
Bang.
Bang.
Fuck!
- Tell me where they are.
Last chance.
- You're losing it.
- Talk.
-
Yeah, I talk and you shoot me
in the head.
- Shut up!
- And one more thing.
I promise you..
...you'll never find them
without me.
Oh.
What are you gonna do now?
- Reload.
- So what's the plan?
- You are gonna take me
to the other girls.
-
like a dog on a leash?
And then we just
set the girls free
- Hand me the keys to the van.
Right now!
- Yeah. Hey, where you going?
You know, you don't want
this on you.
I mean, 4 dead girls? God!
Because you ran away?
Because you left them?
- Put it on.
Put this around your neck.
- Oh.
- I'll put it on. You take me
to the hospital, I'll put it on.
Where'd you learn how to do
the brick thing?
-
- Yeah, I'd love to.
I'd love to do that.
-
- Wanna make a deal?
-
- You take me to the hospital,
I'll show you the girls.
I'll take you to the girls,
you take me to the hospital.
- Deal. Put it on.
-
No!
Wait a minute.
- Open the lock.
Unlock it right now.
No more talking.
You fuck with me,
it'll be the last thing
you ever do. You hear me
- Come on.
- Go!
- I'm going.
- To the driver's seat.
Now!
- I can't even breathe.
- Get the keys.
Go.
- Getting there.
Innate there.
- Let's go.
- Where to?
- What?
- I mean, we can either go
to the girl that's the closest
or we can go to the one
that hasn't eaten in a week.
- In a week?
- Yeah.
I never could get top dollar
from any of those girls
like I did for you.
You are one special girl.
- Just take me to the closest!
-
- You better.
-
- Oh!
-
You trust me, right?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God!
- They're all pretty close
together.
No sense driving
all over town, right?
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Go, move.
- You know she is..
- Move, fucker. Don't even
think about trying anything.
- I'm not trying anything.
- Open the door.
- Oh, God!
There are..
- Let me get the keys, okay?
- Shut the fuck up.
Open the door.
- The right keys.
-
Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, she's a bad host.
You're gonna remember
our deal though, right?
- Open the door.
- Alright.
This is too tight.
- I'm not..
I'm not hearing anything.
I'm not seeing anything.
- No, no.
- No, don't!
-
- No, no.
- You're getting her--
- Just stop, stop, stop.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Look, look, look.
-
-
Shut up!
- No. No. No.
- Please. It's okay. I'm here
to help you. Please, look.
- She's broken! Don't do it.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Don't do it.
- No, no. Nina! Nina! No, Nina!
No, stop!
-
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, Eve. See this..
It's not all hero shit here,
is it, sweet cheeks?
Huh?
- Get up!
- Wait.
I'll get up.
-
- Oh, shit.
- Get in the van now. Let's go!
- Jesus! Fuck!
-
-
-
-
- Couple of blocks.
Nice job, by the way.
- Shut up.
- The best thing that girl had
going for her
was that room back there.
And you fucking took it away.
It's always like that.
Nobody cares.
Unless you're white, rich.
Anyway..
...hope you got
a new plan 'cause..
- Get out.
- Going to the long route.
- Move.
Take the keys.
- Hey, look..
- Take the keys! Go.
- This thing's choking.
- Move.
Where is it?
- It's this way.
Right this way.
Over here.
Do you like what she's done
with the place?
You gonna kill
this one too?
- Move.
- Laura.
Laura.
Laura, here.
- Get that thing off of her!
- Won't do.
- Get that fuckin' thing
off of her!
- Alright.
I will.
Laura, listen to me.
Listen to my voice.
I'm gonna get this off of you.
Okay. Okay. There we go.
I got that off of you.
- Hurry up.
- We have...company.
- Hurry up.
- This is Eve.
-
- Why are you here?
- Unchain her, right now.
- Okay.
- I'm here to help you, okay?
- What do you want?
- I wanna set you free.
-
They are not all like you,
sweet cheeks. Alright.
- Get over here.
- Let's get this off.
- Who is this slut?
- Oh, you didn't have
to say that.
Eve is a sweet, sweet girl.
And she has come here..
She is here..
...to take your place.
- Nobody takes my place!
- No, no, no! Stop!
-
-
-
- You shot me!
- You piece of shit.
- You shot me, sweet cheeks!
- Fuck you!
I hate you. Fuck you!
You piece of shit.
Die!
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you too.
- No, stop it.
Don't leave.
-
-
-
- You gonna scream?
- No.
- This will hurt.
Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.
- What?
- The pain.
- Those girls aren't anything
like you.
You're different.
Just nicer.
You wanted this.
- You set me up.
- Kind of.
Okay.
Seems like your plan
is not working.
Just...take me
to the police station, huh?
All this will be over.
- At least I can finish this.
- Alright.
Okay.
You win.
I give up.
I never meant to hurt anybody.
I never wanted it to end up
like this.
You gotta believe me.
I'm not a great man, okay?
I have no life.
No money. Nothing.
- So that's why you destroy
other people's lives?
- You suffered.
I suffered, too.
I did.
I watched my mother..
...rot away
with cancer for 5 years.
It wasn't quick.
It was slow
and it was painful.
And I couldn't do anything
about it.
I couldn't help her.
I couldn't even give her
a proper funeral.
I didn't take you.
I never touched you.
I'm not the hunter.
I'm only a..
...zookeeper.
It wasn't personal.
All I ever wanted
was a decent life.
A family.
Maybe a son.
Just like..
...Ronnie would have wanted.
- What the fuck
did you just say?
- Ronnie.
-
- No, no, no, no, no.
-
- My name's Ronnie.
I'm 25.
- What the fuck do you know
about Ronnie?
- I'm just saying
your boyfriend..
Nothing.
I just saw him on TV.
Listen, I'll give you
something big.
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than these girls.
Ronnie knew about it.
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- Ronnie, he went to look
for you when you disappeared.
He never found you.
But he found some things.
I can show you what he found.
After the next house,
after we get Lea.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Wait! Hey, now.
Come on, come on, give it back.
-
- This is my home video.
-
No.
-
-
- Turn off the light.
- Turn it off.
- They kidnapped me.
-
-
- Okay, it's okay.
Look, I'm here to help you.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Come on, man.
He always takes the first ride.
-
-
- What the fuck?
You.
-
-
-
-
-
You fucking..
- It's okay, it's okay.
-
You fucking piece of shit!
Fuck you!
Like that?
- We gotta go.
- Fucking like that?
- You got any real clothes?
- Who are you?
- Here.
Change.
- Who the are you?
- Look, we don't have
much time, okay?
Let's go.
- I don't give a shit
who you are, okay?
I just want to know
who to thank for saving my ass.
-
Help me.
-
- Help.
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- It'll be more painful
if you just leave him.
- Hey! Why aren't we
calling the cops?
- I'm sure they were gonna
rape me in there.
What's wrong with you?
- Where are you going?
- Do you know
what they did to me in there?
- What the fuck
is your problem?
- Hey! Are you fucking
listening to me?
- Get in if you're getting in.
- Christ.
Fuck!
- Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! No!
No!
-
-
-
- Wait, I feel like I'm gonna
be sick. Stop.
- Hey!
-
- Hi.
- Oh, I missed you.
-
- Okay! Whoa!
Whoa.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. Thanks to you, right?
- Is this you?
Do you know this girl? Katrina?
- How did you know where I was?
- What the fuck!
That's the guy who grabbed me.
- Wake up!
Fuck.
-
- Hey!
-
We gotta fucking kill
this piece of shit.
- No!
- We made a deal.
- Told you, no tricks.
- Just shut up!
- I don't give a shit
about your deal.
- Stop.
You're as crazy as he is.
You are crazy.
You would kill her to save me?
You know, she killed
those other two girls.
- Don't you get it?
I found you!
And now we need to find her.
Are you in or are you out?
- Okay.
- I'm not going
anywhere with her.
She's not part of the deal.
How do I know
you won't just stand there
while she me?
- You know what?
That's a fucking good idea.
- Shut up.
Both of you. Can you drive?
Then, do it. Let's go.
- You gonna kill her too?
Another dead body.
- The only dead bodies
are in the house.
- What dead bodies?
- Shut up.
-
- Who the fuck is Ronnie?
-
Or lose it.
- Fuck you!
- Now, we're gonna try again.
If you tell me to fuck off
one more time, I swear to God
they'll be calling you lefty
for the rest of your life.
- Other ones are closer,
you fucking lunatic.
- What others?
- The ones Ronnie found.
- What are you talking about?
What'd he.. Who did he find?
When? Why is he there?
- 101 South.
- Why was Ronnie there?
- Take me...to the hospital.
We had a deal.
- Hey, do you want me
to turn around?
- Drive, just drive.
- If you don't take me there,
I'm not gonna make it.
- Fine. I'll keep you alive.
Even when you're begging me
to kill you.
- 101 South.
- What is this place?
- Somewhere you don't wanna be
for very long.
Door 4.
You can't miss it.
even found it.
- Let's go.
- What about him?
- He's not going anywhere.
- This is a bad idea.
- Yeah, this whole night's
been a bad fucking idea.
- What if there are
more men in there?
- Then, I kill them.
- Oh.
- Come on. Come on.
Goddammit.
- Let me try.
-
-
I think it's here. Come on.
- Who did this to you?
Who runs this place?
- Who did this to you?
- Eve.

New girls come every few week.
-
Girls come and go as they buy.
Men come here,
they choose girl..
...prettier girls go first.

We're here to help.

We gotta go.

Where are you going?
- Look, we can't stop.
We have to go to the next house.
- Why? Why should
we keep going?
- Because there are more girls
I have to save.
I have to save them.
And I had to save
because I had to try!
I gotta go.
- Are you really gonna
leave us here?
Eve, what happened to you?
For saving my life.
- Look, just stay here
and get some help, okay?
There's got to be a phone
around here somewhere.
Ju -- just wait

Be careful.

Okay? I -- I can't --

I was looking
everywhere for you.
Oh, God.
God, you're covered in blood.
Do you need an ambulance?
Are you okay? Are you bleeding?

- Okay, easy, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Put the gun down.
You're safe here.
Okay?

looking for you.
I lost my job.
I spent everything I had.
I lost my home.
Eve, what happened to you?
Tell me what's going on.

Honestly. I thought

What the fuck is that?
What are these pictures?
- Alright.
Hold on. Let me explain..
- Then, fucking start talking!

I searched for you.
The police...they didn't help.
And I...Eve..

Look at me. Stop.
I already searched the photos.
There's nothing in there
that you won't find
Let's just get..

And it's all for you.
There's no reason
to share anymore.
