Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
One of you is gonna
give up your camp.
A prison.
- They were taken.
- By who?
By this guy who calls
himself the Governor.
Daddy still loves you.
I'll go after him.
This place sounds
pretty secure.
I'm in.
Your brother may be out there
right now searching for them.
Everything okay?
Oh, my God, Tyreese!
You okay?
We gotta keep moving.
- Where's everybody else?
- They were just behind me.
- Is there a clearing ahead? A place
to regroup? - I didn't get very far.
There might be
a building up ahead.
I thought I saw a tower
past the trees.
Tower? What kind of tower?
This way!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.
Mom!
Tyreese:
Come on!
Hurry! This way!
Come on!
We don't know what's in there.
We know what's out here.
Not her.
Don't.
She's slowing you down,
she's slowing us down.
And once we're in there,
when she turns...
She's right.
You gotta leave me.
No. Please.
They'll tear her apart.
Sasha.
- We can't do this.
- You wanna drag her around?
She's suffering.
And when she finally turns--
Ben's not ready.
- It's a mistake.
- Maybe.

I promised Milton I'd help him
cremate Mr. Coleman's body.
That's sweet of you,
but if you're still rattled,
he can handle it himself.
He shouldn't have to.
All these people
you've brought together,
they're here for more
than just protection;
they're helping each other
through this mess.
Woododbury's starting
to grow on you, huh?
Good.
Penny?
Honey?
It's Daddy.
Shh.
Baby.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
Daddy's gone a-hunting
To get a little rabbit skin
Look at me, baby.
Look at me.
Look at me!
Maggie, did he--
No.
No.
He barely touched me.
All this time,
running from walkers--
you forget what people do,
have always done.
Look at what they did to you.
Doesn't matter.
As long as he didn't--
No. I promise.
Glenn: Hey.
Hey! Hey!
Damn it.
All right, we need to downsize.
Ain't no way we're gonna
check in all them buildings,
not with all them guards there.
All right, let's go.
The prison's the perfect
place to hole up.
What once kept prisoners in
now keeps biters out.
And that's smart.
You thinking of taking it
over, moving Woodbury there?
People love it here because
it feels like what was.
Move them to damp cells
surrounded by barbed wire?
No.
We gotta take out the group
that's living there.
Let the biters move back in.
No one'll be the wiser.
The problem is
my brother's with them.
Well, you'll talk to him.
Make him our inside man.
He'll get us in there.
- Nothing happens to Daryl.
- Of course not.
What about Glenn and the girl?
Well, the longer they're here,
the more chance
Andrea will find out.
Take them to the Screamer Pits.
Rick: This is where
you were held?
Michonne:
I was questioned.
Any idea where else
they could be?
I thought you said
there was a curfew.
The street is packed during the day.
Those are stragglers.
Rick: If anyone comes in
here, we're sitting ducks.
We gotta move.
Michonne: They could
be in his apartment.
Yeah?
What if they ain't?
Then we'll look somewhere else.
- You said you could help us.
- I'm doing what I can.
- Then where in the hell are they?
- Hey.
If this goes south,
we're cutting her loose.
You think she's leading
us into a trap?
Right now it's the blind
leading the blind.
Let's split up.
I know you're in here.
I saw you moving from outside.
All right, now. You're not supposed
to be in here and you know it.
Who's in here?
Shut up.
Get on your knees.
Hands behind your back.
Zip tie him.
Where are our people?
I don't know.
You are holding
some of our people.
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know.
Open your mouth.
You are good with her.
- You got little sisters?
- No.
- Axel:
May I speak with you?
Me?
I'll be right back.
- What's the problem?
- Stay away from her.
Please.
This isn't about you trying
to repopulate the Earth.
I didn't mean no offense.
I've been locked up
a long while
and, well,
there weren't many women.
You following me?
I mean, Maggie, she's with
Glenn and you're a lesbian.
I was just talking with her.
I'm not a lesbian.
You got the...
short hair.
You're not a lesbian?
My, my,
this is interesting.
No, it's not.
Let him go!
Okay.
Give me the gun!
Get up!
Glad we could catch up.
Just keep looking at me.
I love you.
Man: On your feet, move.
Let's go, come on.
Shit.
Shots came from up there.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- No, I'll handle it.
Sometimes biters get in
through the side fence.
There's no need
for anyone to panic.
Woman:
Someone help!
What happened?
Guys came through with guns.
- Governor:
- Well, think. - Six or seven guys.
I've never seen them before.
Girl: Are we under attack?
What should we do?
Hey, hey, hey.
Everyone, please just go
home, lock your doors, huh?
We need to keep
everyone safe, okay?
So just get inside,
keep your lights off.
Come on.
We're under attack.
You fan out and you
find these people.
Don't take any chances,
try and take prisoners.
You shoot to kill, huh?
Come on.
Rick:
Inside, quick!
- Daryl: Ain't no way out back here.
- Rick, how did you find us?
- How bad are you hurt?
- I'll be all right.
Where's that woman?
She was right behind us.
Daryl: Maybe she was spotted.
Want me to go look for her?
No. We gotta get them
out of here.
She's on her own.
Daryl, this was Merle.
- Rick:
Threw a walker at me.
He was gonna execute us.
S-So my brother's
this governor?
No, it's somebody else.
Your brother's his
lieutenant or something.
Does he know
I'm still with you?
He does now.
Rick, I'm sorry.
We told him wherthe prison was.
- We couldn't hold out.
- Don't. No need to apologize.
Maggie: They're gonna
be looking for us.
We have to get back.
Can you walk?
We got a car a few miles out.
- I'm good.
- All right.
Daryl: Hey, if Merle's
around, I need to see him.
Not now.
We're in hostile territory.
- He's my brother. I ain't--
- Look at what he did!
Look, we gotta-- we gotta
get out of here now.
Maybe I can talk to him.
Maybe I can work something out.
No, no, no.
You're not thinking straight.
Look, no matter what
they say, they're hurt.
Glenn can barely walk.
How are we gonna make it out
if we get overrun by walkers
and this governor
catches up to us?
I need you.
Are you with me?
Yeah.
- Any sign of them?
- Signs of what?
What exactly
is happening out there?
Some assholes want
what we have.
- Then what are we doing waiting
around here? - Damn straight.
Let's take these
sons of bitches out.
How do we know that the
perimeter was breached?
Did anyone actually see them?
- They killed Warren.
- Killed?
We need patrols now.
Can't take chances
with these terrorists.
You check on our people,
make sure they're safe.
You want me to do house calls,
make sure everyone's tucked in?
These guys could be holed up
in one of our residences.
They could be holding
someone captive or worse.
Can't anyone else handle that?
I've got a hell of a lot
of experience and--
Thank you.
The rest of you split up.
Merle will lead the search.
Don't you think Haley should
handle the door-to-doors?
I need someone with some authority
to provide reassurance.
I mean, she's just a kid.
These people have already
killed one man, beaten another.
- I'm good with a gun--
- Just do as I ask.
Sure.
On three.
Stay tight.
One, two, three.
Let's go!
There they are!
Behind you!
Go! Get cover!
Get there.
Go, go, go!
- You all right?
- I saw them.
- How many?
- Oscar:
Don't matter.
There's gonna be more of them.
We need to move.
One of them, at least.
Black guy, young.
Looked like he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit.
Escaped convicts.
- Any grenades left?
- Uh-huh.
Get 'em ready.
We gotta gun into the wall.
We gotta get off the street.
We're not soldiers,
we're survivors.
We'll wait them out.
- Once the smoke clears--
- Nah, they could be anywhere.
- You get off the street.
- Where are you going?
- Off the street. Come on, move!
- Oh shit.
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.
- No, we gotta stay together.
- Too hairy. I'll be right behind you.
Ready?
- Move!
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on!
- Keep going!
Oscar:
This way!
- Ah!
- Glenn: No!
Maggie:
Rick!
Daryl!
Go!
Hershel:
Finally got Judith to sleep.
How are we with formula?
We have enough
to last us another month.
I'll tKe Carol for some more
at the end of the week.
Your dad and the others
will be back by then.
We don't know that.
Right now, Judith is
the only family I got.
- That was from inside.
- Was that Carol?
She's out keeping watch in
the guard tower with Axel.
What if they came back in
for something?
What if they're in trouble?
How could anyone else get in?
The tombs are filled
with walkers
that wandered in from outside.
Someone else could have
done the same thing.
- I'm going.
- I can't let you go down there.
My father would go.
Woman:
Come on!
- Carl:
- Just go.
- Let me take her.
I'll cover you.
Look out!
- You have to leave her!
- No way!
-
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on, come on.
That's it.
Come on.
No!
Don't hurt her.
Look. Hey.
It's me you want.
There's no need
for her to suffer.
She doesn't have needs.
Please.
Don't hurt my little girl.
Please don't.
No!
Ah!
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Come here.
Come, come, come.
No!
Ow! Oh!
Ah!
No!
What have you done?
Oh, good God.
Oh, my God.
Here, here.
Man:
Oh, God! Donna?
Is she dead?
Is she dead?
Baby?
I'll take care of it.
Whoa!
Whoa, kid.
Wait a minute.
- She doesn't have that long.
- Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
Who are you with?
Look, we can help you.
First things first.
No, we take care of our own.
- No, Tyreese!
- I gotta do it.
Look, just take Ben
and lean against the wall.
It'll be quick.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
- Kid, did you just lock us in here?
- Open the door.
This room is secure.
You'll be safe.
You have food and water.
- Open this door.
- I can't.
Come on, man.
We're not animals.
Don't do this.
Hey!
You can't just
leave us in here!
Open this door! Open it! Now!
Sasha!
Back away from their door
and let the man go.
Look around you.
This is the best
we've had it in weeks.
We got other things to do.
We don't want any trouble.
- Shouldn't we help them?
- I did.
It doesn't look good.
The glass has done
a lot of damage.
I need to get out of here.
- Not yet.
- Get out of my way!
Can you give us a minute?
What the hell was that?
Why was she here?
Why were you fighting her?
She came back to kill me.
- Why?
- You tell me.
You knew her.
The fish tanks, the heads?
I made myself look at them.
Prepared me for
the horrors outside.
And Penny?
Oh, my God.
I just heard.
Are you all right?
Your eye, is it--
What happened to you?
I was attacked.
Merle: They made
it over the wall.
I'll go after them
in the morning.
Here, here.
Get down.
Come on, Daryl.
Rick: Where the hell were you?
Put your hands up.
Turn around.
Turn around.
- Get what you came for?
- Where are the rest of your people?
- They got Oscar.
- Daryl is missing. You didn't see him?
- If anything happens to him--
- I brought you here to save them.
Thanks for the help.
You'll need help to get
them back to the prison
or to go back
in there for Daryl.
Either way, you need me.
What can I say?
Hasn't been a night like this
since the walls were completed.
And I thought
we were past it--
past the days when we all sat,
huddled, scared
in front of the TV
during the early days
of the outbreak.
The fear we all felt then,
I failed you.
I promised to keep you safe.
Hell, look at me.
You know, I--
I should tell you
that we'll be okay,
that we're safe,
that tomorrow we'll bury
our dead and endure,
but I-- I won't,
because I can't.
Because I'm afraid.
That's right.
I'm afraid of terrorists
who want what we have.
Want to destroy us!
And worse...
because one
of those terrorists...
is one of our own.
Merle...
He led 'em here.
And he let 'em in.
It was you.
You lied,
betrayed us all.
This is one of the terrorists.
Merle's own brother.
What should we do
with them, huh?
- Crowd: Kill them!
- What?
- What you want?
- Crowd: Kill them!
Kill them!
You wanted your brother.
Now you got him.
