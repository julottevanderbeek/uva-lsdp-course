In my planet, the women are barren.
I traveled secretly...
across the depths of space,
assuming human form...
so I'd may came to know earthly women...
and repopulate my desolated planet.
I wish for you to know
my true name. Xunobulax.
- Xunobulax?
- Yeah.
Our race makes love just once.
We put all our cosmic energy
into that one explosive... act...
and then, like your terrestrial mayfly...
we die of a sweet early content.
I want to make love to you
in the manner of my people.
I want it to be my last act.
Keep that up, Rod, and it will be
your last act.
I can't return home without
accomplishing my mission.
I said stop!
- I want my first time to be with you.
- And so do I.
Cool, I understand. Please, Stacy.
What the fuck is this?
Hold on.
Ben! Get your ass over here!
Mark, is that you in there?
This isn't funny!
What the hell...
Rod!
No! Rod!
Stacy...
Stacy...
Stacy!
Stacy!
No! Rod!
Oh, my God!
Mmm...
I was supposed to be home 15 minutes ago.
Sixth graders can stay out
later than you can.
-
-
No, baby, come on...
No, no, no, no... No.
No.
Mmm... Stop.
Doesn't it ever bother you
you could die a virgin?
Yeah. It's right up there
with global warming.
I think we should start
seeing other people.
What?
Look... we've been dating
for about a year,
and I really don't think
it's working out. All right?
- Hi, Mrs. Marken.
- You two having fun?
Hi, Mom.
Kenny, you wouldn't happen to
have a cigarette for me, would ya?
Sure.
Mrs. Marken, smoking's really bad for you.
Ah...
The industrial strength.
I owe you.
I'm going to have to smoke this here.
Brent doesn't like me
to smoke in the house.
- It's my last guilty pleasure.
- Is Dad still up?
- My, we're out late tonight, huh?
- Kenny was just leaving.
Too bad.
It looks like the coast is clear.
If you want to beat the heat,
you better hurry up.
- Mrs. Marken?
- Mm-hmm.
- Your headlights are on.
- Very observant.
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.
So, is this goodbye or good night?
Pick one.
- Pick one.
- I think it's up to you.
Don't... slam the door!
Like a little tiny mouse.
Ssh.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Do you know what time it is?
- Daddy, don't scare me like that.
You're grounded the next two
Friday nights.
Most 6th graders stay out
later than I can.
They're not the sheriff's daughter.
SHERIFF: Marken.
Alright, I'll get down there
as soon as I can.
Daddy.
- You're the only one here?
- First on the scene.
The forensics and homicide
are on their way from Richmond.
That's the victim's car.
It's covered in blood, Sheriff.
Over here, I found the boy
faced down in the water...
with about a million stab wounds.
And the girl...
Well, nailed to a tree.
A lot of blood pumped out of
her wounds, which means...
Which means all this was done
to her while she was still alive.
Jody, doll... listen...
I'm trying to pump out a special
edition of the paper before lunchtime.
And if you tell me all that you know,
I'll be your best friend...
your very, very best friend... and
you can be co-editor of the paper,
and apply to all those Ivy League schools
with those young marriageable boys.
What do ya think?
Don't be silent like that. No, no, no.
I want you to talk to your dad and snoop
dog for me. You know what I'm saying?
Timmy, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.
You haven't heard about Rod and Stacy?
Are you already taking footnotes for
your pathetic little gossip column?
- Did they break up?
- Break up? Wake up, they're dead!
They flatlined, they shuffled
off the mortal coil,
they croaked, and gone
to see their maker. Duh...
How can you be so critically uninformed?
Will you look, the whole school is
buzzing with that music.
Look! Maybe there's something for my
incredibly pathetic gossip column after all.
Like I'm not paying attention.
Mr. Sisler, Sheriff Marken's
here to see you, sir.
- Shall I bring him in?
- Yeah. Thank you, Diana.
- Oh, Brent. It's been a while.
- Tom.
I don't need to tell you what
an uproar the school is in.
I canceled all the regular
classes for the day and...
asked the teachers to
counsel and console the kids.
I know there are professionals
for these sorts of situations, but...
- I thought it'd be best coming from...
- Listen, Tom.
I'm to have to stop by some of your
classes... to ask a few questions.
I'd like to start with the ones
those two kids attended.
Naturally, you're all horrified...
by the sudden senseless loss
of your classmates.
Perhaps some of you feel guilty that
you weren't nicer to Rod and Stacey
while they were alive
or maybe you're... I don't know...
haunted by something unpleasant
you might have said to one of them.
Once, in the 8th grade,
I had a fight with Rod...
And I told him to fuck off and die!
Hey, come on, guys.
It's alright, Heather.
Maybe we'll all feel better if we talk
about our lost classmates and how we feel.
Mark, you were friends with Rod.
Do you want to say something?
Oh, man...
I don't know, I'm just...
Thank you, Mark.
How about you, Sandy?
Sandy!
Oh, um... I... I, uh...
I guess at times like this...
I just hope there's a heaven.
Lame.
Cindy, come on.
I think it's important in times like this
we offer each other some support.
I'd like to offer the killer's ass some
support in the fucking electric chair.
That's a legitimate reaction,
unfortunately, the means of execution in
this state happens to be lethal injection.
Ben, I know you have a very different
point of view regarding this tragedy.
So...
Go ahead.
Well, I would like to know whether
this killer...
removed any body parts, or sexually
defiled any orifice of either victims.
You're tragically sick.
I wanna know, because if he didn't,
I'm starting to think this loser
deserves a thumbs down.
How can you be so insensitive?
And you're like Mother Teresa?
You're the one told Rod to drop dead.
You're only fooling yourself with this
display of indifference.
Hey, Jackhole, you're not playing
Death Quake now, this is the real world!
Fuck you.
This is Ben's pathetic concept of cool,
He has to pretend he's not afraid.
Well, hello Cindy Freud!
What's your concept of cool, doc?
Bang the entire senior class
starting with "A"?
If I'm so all used up then, why do
you try to hook me up nonstop?
- I find experience attractive!
- Alright, shut up now, would you please?
Everyone! Jesus!
What is wrong with you people?
Jody...
certainly I can count on you to say
something singularly constructive.
Dad?
Please excuse the intrusion,
Mr. Marliston,
but Sheriff Marken would like
to address the class.
Hi, Sheriff... Leonard Marliston.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Likewise.
Class, please give your attention
to Sheriff Marken.
Two of your fellow students,
Rod Harper and Stacy Twelfmann...
were murdered last night at the falls...
by a person or persons unknown,
in a cold-blooded fashion.
The reason I came here was to ask
you, as friends and good citizens...
to come forward to me or my staff...
with any information you might have
concerning this terrible crime.
- TEACHER: Is there a suspect yet, Sheriff?
- SHERIFF: No.
TEACHER: Well, is there any other
information you can give us?
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the case any further.
Well, Sheriff, Plato says that
polis can only remain healthy
if truth is available to all citizens.
Well, Plato can give out all details he
wants when he's the sheriff of this town.
JODY: He's doing it deliberately.
Of course he is.
All the more reason
why you should ignore it.
Do you think she goes all the way?
Doubt it.
Who'd want to fuck her?
Look.
Shit.
Stop throwing shit!
- Fuck you!
- Jesus Christ!
Okay now, I am done with relationships...
but I see a hope for you.
Come on. Come on.
- No, Jody, no.
- Come on. It's sad and pathetic.
You watch him eat every single day
and you never talk to him.
My parents have been married for 25 years
and all they do is watch TV.
Come on, you're going to go.
You're going to talk to him.
You don't want to make a scene!
How are you doing?
It's a pretty freaky day today, isn't it.
Yeah, I guess so.
You shit sucking liar!
I'm gonna kill you!
Better than a cock-sucking liar!
I'll kill you, you little shit!
What's going on here?
It's a compliment when a guy
says you can suck good dick.
You got something on your mouth there.
- He's lying to everyone about me!
- Tell me about it in the office!
Hey, hey!
What's your phone number, Annette?
No, it was someone, not me.
What's up with that?
Dylan's been telling people
Annette gave him a hummer.
- Did she?
- Are you kidding?
No.
She thinks fellatio is a
character in Shakespeare.
She wouldn't know a dick
if its name was Woody.
That's funny.
What do you think, Mark?
Huh?
I think these ribs rule.
Come on, honey, we're late.
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.
Here we go.
Hello. Come here handsome.
Good to see you!
Who is it?
- Hi, Annette?
- Yeah?
- It's Loralee Sherman.
- Excuse me?
Loralee Sherman. Is your mom home?
Uh...
No.
- She didn't tell you I was coming by?
- No.
I must have just missed her.
Can I leave a note?
Okay, just one second.
Could you slip it through
the door, please?
I think I'm ready for the run.
Hey, hey, come on now.
What's the hurry, gorgeous?
Slow down. Slow down.
- Who left the door open?
- I don't know.
- Annette?
- Annette?
Annette!
- Annette!
-
- Grab there...
- Okay.
Grab underneath. Get a good grip, alright?
Step through, let their weight and
their momentum take them over.
- Okay.
- The most important thing is this grip.
- Latch on like a pitbull.
-
Is there any way you
could give me some mace,
or maybe a ray gun, stun gun, anything?
No, it's against the law. Here I come.
- Take 5, champ.
- Okay.
Marken.
Looks like we have
an encore performance, Sheriff.
Agent Bronhill, this is
special agent Majestik.
- Who was first on the scene?
- My deputy.
I responded to the father's
call around 11:00 pm,
notified the sheriff
immediately afterwards.
We got this.
We're in the big league now.
CORONER:
As you can see on the inside left thigh
there's a one inch deep carving
of the word "virgin".
The ones we found in all 3 victims.
Like Stacy Twelfmann...
Annette DeWolde was in fact a virgin
at the time of death.
The hymen was intact. We found no
evidence of semen on the clothes...
skin, hair, mouth, or the anus.
No abrasions or contusions
in the pubic region.
In fact no evidence of
sexual penetration of any kind.
Neither was the boy we found
in the first killings sexually assaulted.
Of course I can't tell you
if he died a virgin...
but I can tell you that he did not
have sex at the time of the killings.
It would appear...
that your killer has been quite accurate
in the application of his signature.
Come in.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
Listen...
I need to ask you a personal question.
- About what?
-
It's about you and Kenny.
- What is it?
- About how far you've gone?
Gone?
Gone, you know...
base wise.
Are you two kissing?
Of course.
I'm not a child anymore, Dad.
That's normal.
I'm not criticizing.
I know. I know...
Have you gone further than that?
Listen, I wouldn't ask you this unless
it was absolutely necessary.
Can you go further... than you have?
Yes.
No, no, but you don't have
to worry about it.
Okay?
We just broke up the other day.
Yeah.
Are you disappointed... Dad?
Hm?
Are you disappointed
that I'm still a virgin?
No, no... not at all.
Okay...
I'm very, very, very proud of you.
You're still my little girl.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I love you.
Parents in our town need to know
what's really going on here.
Does that mean revealing the signature?
Yeah, I suppose it does.
Textbooks say don't.
It'll leave us no conclusive way
to verify the killer's confession.
- It could also spur copycat crimes.
- This is different.
This isn't a signature. It's a message.
Message?
I want you to set up an
emergency town meeting.
Tonight at 6:00 pm.
And I want every parent of every
teenager in town there. Do it.
We don't have a venue big enough for that.
We'll use the gym at the high school.
No kids. Not yet.
There you are, Mr. Marliston.
- Oh, Jody... Hi.
- Hi.
I finished my T.S. Elliot paper.
Great. Wow.
I want you to know,
I really love his work.
Good.
"Alas, our dried voices
When we whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind and dry grass
BOTH: Or rats feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar"
Do you think that that's how it is
between people, Mr. Marliston?
Everything dry...
and meaningless and hopelessly empty?
Um...
I heard that you broke up with Kenny.
What does that have to do with it?
I'm very over him.
Do you think that any serious
thought that I have...
is solely attributed to my one
misspent year with Kenny Ascot?
No, I'm sorry. Jody, I'm... it's, uh...
Oh, God...
I'm sorry. I'm very embarrassed
that I just yelled at you.
No, I... I'm really sorry,
it's none of my business.
What's wrong?
It's weird. I just saw
someone standing there.
- Jody, no... Jody...
- What?
Come out!
- Anything?
- No, no.
I guess we've spooked each other
pretty good, didn't we?
Yeah...
Come on, I have to go to this meeting
your father organized.
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Mr. Marliston?
- Yeah?
Um...
Can we talk again sometime?
- Jody, of course.
- I mean just us.
Um... yeah.
Sure, yeah...
- Go home, Jody.
- Okay.
- Run!
- Okay.
You cannot tell these parents that
somebody's murdering virgins.
Maybe Annette DeWolde
would be alive today...
if I had revealed details
about the first two killings.
Jeez, Brent, get a hold of yourself.
You've got responsibilities.
Get your hands off me!
Don't talk to me about responsibilities!
You and I both know what it
means to walk away from those.
If word gets back to these kids
that somebody is...
murdering virgins, we're
gonna have a goddamn...
fuck fest on our hands.
It's better than a pile of dead teenagers.
- Oh, God...
- Boo!
- What are you doing here?
- Timmy, what are you doing here?
- I'm getting the scoop.
- Then, get it.
SHERIFF: I want to thank you
very much for coming out this evening.
As I'm sure you all know...
in the last two days
we have lost 3 of our children.
We have now established a
common link between those killings.
Well, what is it?
All 3 victims attended
our public high school...
and all 3 victims,
to the best of our knowledge...
appeared to be... virgins.
Holy hymens, Batman!
They're killing virgins?
You're not suggesting that's
more than coincidence?
- Are you close to an arrest?
- No.
Well, what are we supposed
to tell our kids?
To go out and get laid if they
want to feel safe?
No, I'm not saying that.
I can't lock my daughter
up in the basement.
I wouldn't worry about it, Victor.
What are you saying about my daughter?
Sit down, Victor, I was joking.
It 's a hell of a time to be joking
about a thing like this!
Hey, back off!
This is totally excellent!
Would you look at them?
They've turned into a bunch of
mindless animals down there!
- Jody, get out of the way.
-
Battery! Can I use your phone
for a second? Please?
- Please? No, no, no, no.
- You never give it back to me.
SHERIFF:
Please, remember why we came here!
- Just give this to me.
- Here, here, here.
Elway? Stop the presses...
Listen, I've got your story for you.
Virgin killer terrorizes...
Wait, you're breaking up.
No, no, no, not virtue killer...
virgin killer!
I gotta get out of this corridor, hang on.
I'm asking you for the last time!
Alright, that's enough!
Oh, Daddy...
Timmy?
Timmy!
I need my cell phone back!
Timmy!
Timmy?
Shit!
Timmy!
Timmy!
Timmy...
Timmy?
Timmy, come on! This isn't funny anymore!
I'll be your best friend.
Your very, very, very best friend.
- Oh... is that for me?
-
Virgin.
Ah...
-
-
-
-
Jody! Jody!
- Daddy, she was after me!
- What?
She killed Timmy! She's in there!
- Take her! Stay back!
- Dad, be careful, please!
Maybe the nose was just
a little bit smaller.
And there was a gray streak right there.
Like that, yeah.
That's her.
That's at least what I saw of her.
Can you make her, Sheriff?
I don't know.
Hey, listen to me! Listen to me!
- Listen to me!
- Give me the bell.
You stupid fucking FBI sons of bitches,
why don't you come out here and get me?
You did good, baby.
Listen to me, I killed those kids.
- I've got to make a couple of calls.
- Okay.
Your mother will be here
in a couple of minutes, okay?
- Okay.
- You'll be fine.
Hey!
- I killed those kids.
- Watch your language.
You're a bunch of sons of bitches!
That's what you are.
And you know what? I loved
killing those kids. They were evil.
I loved killing them. But do you know
what I did before I killed them?
I kissed them. Like this!
Rolly, that's my name! Don't you hurt me!
I'm telling you! I'm telling you!
I know my rights!
Brent.
Great meeting last night.
Very comforting to the parents.
- Listen, are you alone?
- Yes.
Good, because I got something
I wanna show you.
I'm faxing to you now.
Are you looking at it?
Tell me that's not her.
- Who?
- Loralee Sherman. Tell me that's not her?
Oh, jeez Brent, you are cracking up.
A few years ago,
I thought about contacting her.
I traced her to West Virginia.
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.
Listen, Brent... Nobody has seen
or heard of her for over 25 years.
Now why the hell would she be showing up
now as some sort of psycho killer?
Put the phone down, I'll call you back.
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?
Were you listening to me?
What did you hear?
No, I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call Mom.
I couldn't figure out how
to get a line out, that's all.
Sorry, honey.
This case, I guess it's, uh...
guess it's really getting to me.
I'm sorry, baby,
it's not your fault, honey.
It's not your fault.
- Hi, Sheriff Marken.
- Hello, Sandy.
Oh, my God, Jody. Are you okay?
Everybody's been asking about you.
Sheriff! Rolly, prisoner wants
to make a full confession.
I hope it's faster than
last week's confession.
- God, you're not gonna believe this.
- What?
Hurricane hormone has hit
the whole entire school.
Word got out that your attacker
has this thing for virgins.
So everyone's decided to take themselves
off endangered species list. And have sex.
You're making it sound like
it's some kind of a flu shot.
We're talking hymen holocaust here.
But they couldn't print the location,
so I'm gonna give you the 411.
- Where is it?
- The old Donkey Hill hunting lodge.
That skashy keg place?
That place is such a shithole.
All we need is floor space.
Didn't you want your first time to be
something beautiful, something romantic?
Jody, you have to go!
Everybody's gonna be there.
Mark's going, of course. And Kenny.
And you cannot leave saving his life
up to that slut Sharon.
Cindy's holding her pre-game talk
at the bleacher's at lunch. All girls.
Jody...
- Sweetheart, how's my baby?
- I'm fine, Mom.
How's your leg? Mm... baby.
Hi, Mrs. Marken.
Sandy, good to see you.
I'm so happy you're here.
Honey, are you finished yet?
You ready to come home?
- I was gonna go to school with Sandy.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why don't you go home with your mother?
Dad, I'd really like to be
with my friends right now.
She'll be safe with us, Mr. Marken.
It's okay, Sheriff.
I'll keep an eye on her.
- Jody!
- Come on!
- It's nice to see you, Jody.
- Are you alright?
How did you make it through?
Hi.
Jody...
I almost lost you.
I don't think I could
go on living if I had.
- Really?
- Of course.
What about what's her face?
Ah, Jody, I love you.
But I still have female friends.
- But?
- But...
Let's not fight. Come with me
to this party tonight.
No, I promised my dad I'd be home
after school and I'd stay there.
I promised.
Look, if you don't want to go with me...
just say so.
- Don't use your dad as an excuse.
- I'm not.
Who's that?
- It 's my bodyguard.
- Bodyguard?
Yeah. I told my dad I'd be home at 3.
But you'll come with me? You'll come
with me later and we'll go together?
I'll think about it.
Girls have to do everything.
Boys are totally clueless when
it comes to sex.
It starts with them
trying to unhook our bras,
fumbling around and it never changes.
Wait until they try to put
their dicks in you.
Please don't say they need help with that?
Always.
- What about birth control?
- Girls, there's no time for the pill...
and certainly no chance
for withdraw, so...
I recommend condoms.
What about clitoral or vaginal orgasm?
Unless we're talking about
masturbation, forget it.
Aren't you being just
a little hard on the boys?
Dennis asked me today
if chicks had 2 holes or 3.
- Did not!
- How could you not know that, dude?
Oh, yeah, I forgot I was hanging
with the poontang clan back here.
I get it that four kids are dead, but...
I'm sorry, this is still pretty choice.
No shit!
Next thing we have to do, is find a psycho
who's offing chicks who don't give head.
Yeah... Then I don't have
to worry about one hole.
Nice and good afternoon.
This is Stan Michaels, coming to you live
from George Washington High School...
the epicenter of what can only
be described as...
the senseless slaughter of innocence
here in Cherry Falls, Virginia.
In the last 3 days, four teenagers have
been killed, a fifth viciously attacked.
Certain local officials believe
the killer, still at large...
may be targeting teenage
high school virgins.
And now, students here on campus
are rumored have organized a sex party
to actually eliminate themselves
as possible targets.
P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT: Attention,
this is your principal speaking.
It has come to my notice
that certain individuals
have taken it upon themselves
to organize a wild party tonight.
I want you to know...
that any George Washington High
student attending this gap,
will be disadvantaged by every
penalty it is in my power to impose.
-
-
This report says local school officials at
a loss as to how to handle the situation.
We'll get comments now from students...
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck, or die!
Hail, hail, Virgin High!
Drop your pants and fuck or die!
Hi, Mom.
How's my brave little baby?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry, Deputy Mina was
watching me like a hawk all day.
Must've been a very
interesting day at school.
Yeah...
Definitely wasn't your typical Thursday.
I smell fresh cookies here.
These are a little bit burnt,
but I've got another batch coming out
of the oven in a second.
Mmm.
Oh, honey. Don't eat this.
Spit it out. Come on.
Then let me get you some water
to wash it down.
Mom? Do you know anything about
a woman named Loralee Sherman?
Loralee Sherman?
- Yeah.
- No, why?
I overheard Daddy talking to
Mr. Sisler and they mentioned her.
I have no idea who you're talking about.
Mr. Sisler said that she had
disappeared 25 years ago.
Wouldn't a story like that
make small town news?
I've never heard of her,
and I've lived here all my life...
except those two years at Berkeley.
You know, I think you should go
lie down, take a little rest.
You're looking a little pale. And I'll
call you when it's time for dinner, okay?
I'm wasted.
Okay, sweetheart?
I'm going to West Virginia.
West Virginia? We need you here.
Well, there's something
I've gotta do there.
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.
But we are getting some calls
from some irate parents.
What do you want us to do about this sex
party the high school kids are throwing?
Sex party? Do you know where it is?
I'll find out.
Treat it like any other party.
If there's trouble, move in.
Otherwise, lay off.
I could be gone a while.
-
-
Oh, God, Mom!
What are you doing here?
You get your ass home right now!
Mom, tell me about Loralee Sherman.
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me!
When I was in high school...
there was a girl named Loralee Sherman...
that claimed she was raped by...
And?
Nobody was ever formally charged. Nobody.
Nobody was ever charged.
Was there any evidence?
- Did she identify them?
- Yeah.
Then why weren't they charged?
Because they were from good families,
stars of the football team.
That kind of thing. And she was just
this loner that nobody cared for.
She just thought she was
smarter than everybody.
Nothing would have ever come from it.
I don't know if it would have
held up in court.
Not then, and I don't think it
would have held up now.
So, you all just let it go?
Yeah...
She left town...
and nobody ever saw her again.
And that was...
That was 27 years ago.
Who were the men that raped her?
Well...
Two of the guys left town
about the year after that.
And that was good thing, because we were
all able to move forward from there.
Who else?
- Tommy Sisler.
- The Principal.
You said that there were four men.
Who is the fourth?
Mom?
Who is the fourth, Mom?
Mom?
Your father. Your father.
Honey, he didn't participate. He was
sick, he was falling down drunk.
But he went to the police then, and
then he told them what happened?
Honey, those were his good friends.
He couldn't do that.
And besides,
what are you gonna tell the police?
That a drunken girl had sex
with three drunken boys?
- I mean who...
- No.
You said it was rape.
-
-
: 44, 10-5 to 45.
What's your twenty?
I'm headed back now.
Did you find what
you were looking for, sir?
Sir?
I don't know.
Well, I got a message for you
to meet up with Tom Sisler
at the high school tonight, ASAP.
Say what?
Something to do with a Loralee Sherman.
I spoke to his secretary, sir.
Sir, are you there?
Roger that. I'll check it out.
Honey, I really need to see you.
You're early.
My parents are total frauds.
- It's disgusting.
- Of course they are.
They're your parents.
My dad's into hookers.
I think my mom probably was a hooker.
I can't believe I let them influence
every single decision that I've ever made.
You lose your spiritual virginity...
when you realize that your parents...
are even bigger hypocrites
than your friends are.
Yeah...
Mmm...
Bite it.
Bite it.
Bite it.
Mmm...
Harder.
Mmm...
yeah...
Harder.
Mmm...
- Harder.
- Mmm...
- Harder.
- Mmm!
Harder!
Mmm!
Let's do it.
Kenny, you've been pressuring me
for a whole year to sleep with you.
Let's just do it.
You're only doing it
'cause you're pissed at your parents.
Aww...
What's wrong, Kenny?
Can't you decide?
It doesn't have to be
this complicated, baby.
Oh...
Don't you like my body?
I love your...
I love your body, baby.
I just want you to be with me
because you want to be with me.
That's all.
Spare me the violins.
Hey, where are you going?
I changed my mind about tonight.
I don't need some stupid kids sex party.
You have better company in mind?
Well...
Frankly, yes.
Like Mr. Marliston, maybe?
Whoa...
Where did that come from?
I've seen you hanging out with him.
Well, you probably have.
So now, I should start
looking for you around every corner...
eavesdropping,
snooping and sneaking about?
Kenny, I had no idea
that your poor mind...
was so diseased.
If you go now,
I don't want to see you again!
It's over!
-
- Ah...
You take the north side, you take the rear.
Beau, you get the south.
I'll watch the front.
Hey Deputy, do you want to
infiltrate the party with me?
Go undercover for half an hour?
Get movin'!
Hey...
Oh... Hi, Mark.
Sharon, you look voluptuous.
Eww...
What is that smell?
It's just a little cologne.
I, uh, wouldn't go near any candles
if I were you.
You might spontaneously combust.
- Hi, Mark.
- Oh, hi.
What's that smell?
Uh...
Nothin'.
I like it.
Yeah?
You like to dance?
Hi.
Have you ever played Death Quake?
Okay, but you have to wear a rubber.
- And I want your CDs.
- Not my imports.
I want everything.
Domestic, imports, bootlegs, works.
Okay, you can have my CDs.
- And your K2 snowboard.
- Not my snowboard.
Alright, the board too.
You know, that's an awful lot
for 10 minutes of beasting.
Don't flatter yourself, you'll be
lucky to last 10 seconds.
You just better hope that when I erupt
you don't end up on the ceiling.
- Hi.
- Hey, Sharon...
You don't have to be nervous.
You're the one who's shaking.
You okay?
Yeah...
Yeah. Oh...
What 's wrong?
I can't face this is happening again.
Twice today I stopped a girl from
putting her hands in my pants.
Is there something you want to
tell me? I don't mind a challenge.
Right. Neither do I.
Thank you, Sharon. Thank you.
You could've given it a shot.
Hey, uh, I always knew
he was a butt pirate.
- You wanna get with a real man?
- No. Do you?
Ow!
Hi, Mr. Marliston.
Oh, jeez Jody, you scared me. Hi.
I'm sorry.
- How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?
What have you got in this trunk?
Oh, just, you know,
just some old memorabilia.
Do you want a hand or something?
Yeah... yeah, I could use
a hand with this.
Are you sure you're up for it?
It's going all the way into my basement.
There, go this way.
You know...
You're just about the only person
that I trust these days.
Me? Come on. What about your dad?
I know how close you are with your father.
I found out some pretty terrible
things about my father recently.
- Oh, yeah...
- Yeah.
Like what? That he's a liar,
a fraud... a criminal?
Yeah.
What's in the trunk?
Your dad.
Maybe mine.
Daddy!
Ah...

Hey, Brent, tell us the story...
Tell us about what happened
when you were very drunk.
Tom Sisler's in the story, and so is a woman
by the name of Loralee Sherman.
There are people who can help you.
Don't hurt her! Please!
I'm not gonna hurt her.
You are, with the truth.
I'll get you started.
See, I remember the story like this.
It was...
a dark and scary night...
kind of like tonight.
My mother already told me this story!
You can't hurt me with this story!
Shut up! Shut up!
I'll kill you if you don't shut up!
Alright! I'll tell you!
There were four of us.
We were drunk.
About ready to graduate from high school.
We were going to a party to
celebrate the end of our senior year.
Then we saw a car broke down
on the side of the road.
It was Loralee.
We all knew her from school.
She was a weird kid.
Kind of pretty in a way, I guess.
I was in really bad shape.
Tom told her to get into his car, but...
she wouldn't do it.
So, they started teasing her.
Laughing at her.
And then she got mad.
She called Tom a homo...
...and then she just took off.
And they took off right after her.
That's when things got crazy.
They poured booze down her throat.
Then, I guess what happened...
Well, you know what happened.
Yeah, well, I don't remember,
so, keep going.
First Tom, then Harry...
...then Jim.
Then, they came looking for me...
and they grabbed me...
...they threw me on top of her.
But I knew what I was doing.
God help me, I knew what I was doing!
God, daddy, no.
Happy graduation, baby! Woo!
I knew.
Did you know that she
was in love with you, Brent?
Oh, yeah. Love letters, poems, songs...
All things she wrote before you raped her.
That's why she came over to the car.
Because she saw your face.
She never had the nerve to approach
the big star quarterback, Brent Marken.
You never knew that
she loved you, did you, Brent?
Oh, how could you?
She never had the nerve to approach
you before you raped her.
And after you raped her,
there was no one to tell.
Except me.
-
-
Over and over again.
It's very difficult to look like
the one person in the world
your mother loves and hates the most.
We have the same color of eyes...
No...
Dad.
No, no...
No... No.
It's a stinking hypocritical world,
isn't it, Brent?
Where rapists become
the pillars of the community.
And the stinking
hypocritical people in it...
wouldn't even miss their own
worthless befouled lives very much.
So...
So, what better to deprive them
of the only innocence they have left.
Their precious...
virginal children.
Please! Don't hurt her!
SHERIFF MARKEN: No!
SHERIFF MARKEN: No!
Does that hurt?
Please, help!
Help!
Shut up!
- Goddamn that bell!
-  Help!
I'm coming!
Hi, Kenny.
What are you doing here at midnight?
Mister Marliston...
Mister... M...
Something wrong with your mouth, Kenny?
What do you want?
- Where's Jody?
- How should I know?
'Cause her bike is parked by your stairs.
No, it's not.
Why are you looking at me
like that, Kenny?
- Why are you wearing lipstick?
- Because it makes me pretty.
Jody!
Jody!
Jody!
You hurt my daughter! I'm gonna kill you!
Jody! Jody! Jody!
Get out of here!
Fuckin' move!
Jody, come on!
The music! To the lounge, come on!
Hold it! You stop right there!
Mr. Marliston just killed my daddy!
He killed all those kids.
He's trying to kill us!
- Jody?
- Yeah.
Well, who's that with you?
I'm Kenny Ascott!
And everything she says is true!
RADIO: This is White Knight on the south
side to Black Queen, do you copy, over?
- Black Queen to White Knight, over.
- Brent's dead! Marliston's the killer!
He nailed the chief! Do you copy, over?
- You better come, come on.
- This is my post, I can't just split!
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Nobody's here. Let's move!
- Help!
- Help!
- It's Mr. Marliston! He's the killer!
- Let's run!
Class dismissed!
Run, Jody! Run!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Come on!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Go away!
Jody!
Stay there.
Kenny!
Kenny!
- Mark, don't!
- Man, get back here!
Mister Marliston.
- No!
- Get outta here!
So you have absolutely no idea
why your father was in West Virginia?
And you can think of no reason...
why Leonard Marliston
committed these murders?
No.
And after all this, you can think
of nothing else to tell me?
I think you've asked my daughter
enough questions. Agent Bronhill.
Well, thank you for now, ladies.
You've been very cooperative.
Let's go.
