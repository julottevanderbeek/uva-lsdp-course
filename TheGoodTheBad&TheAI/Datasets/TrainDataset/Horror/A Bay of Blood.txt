A BAY OF BLOOD
It's so nice,
the calm after the storm.
What is it?
Can you hear it?
What?
- It's a squonk.
- A squonk?
And what's that?
The squonk?
You surprise me.
A girl of your intelligence
doesn't know what a squonk is?
It's an animal
covered in moles
that can camouflage
itself perfectly.
I think it's exclusively female,
but it's easy to find
because it's very vain and
it never stops whining.
And when it's captured...
it dissolves into tears.
You act like a thief
where love's concerned.
You take it and run.
Other characteristics of the squonk
are sulkiness, diffidence
and possessiveness.
Very inconvenient qualities
for a personal secretary.
Well, more than that...
a partner in an affair as important
as this.
- Where are you going?
- To the bay.
We're on the home stretch,
I've got to close the deal.
The police suspended investigations
into the Countess' death,
there was no evidence.
A case of suicide.
Everything's fine.
I just need a signature.
Bye!
- Franco!
- Yes?
- Take me with you.
- Better not right now.
Maybe later.
But call me first.
Bye, squonk!
Bye. Be careful!
Give them to me!
You'll have a heart attack
chasing after that bug!
How do you know
it's the same one?
Because it's the only insect
that's escaped you.
Not the only, but he...
...is very intelligent and remembers
last autumn
when I put a ring round one of
his horns and let him go.
- Why?
- To study his habits.
Sure... to see if he's horny!
Men should leave others to
enjoy their freedom.
Even that poor octopus
was free once, Simone.
I study beetles because I love them.
Yes, you pin them to boards
or preserve them in display cases.
At least I eat my octopus.
I don't kill as a hobby like you!
My God, Simon,
you make me feel like a murderer!
I didn't say that,
Mr Fossati.
When one kills contrary to the laws
of nature, one becomes a monster.
But man isn't an insect,
dear Simon.
We have thousands of years
of civilization behind us.
I don't know about that.
I wasn't there.
You've changed...
...ever since Federica was killed.
Suicide... Mr Fosatti.
Suicide.
The police said it was suicide.
Of course...
Sorry... a slip of the tongue!
Don't worry, Your Honour.
By tonight I'll have all the
documents signed by the heir.
Of course.
No, everything's in order.
We'll wait a while before starting
work, out of respect.
The poor Countess... well, she came to
a rather nasty end.
Of course, I don't think I'm
underestimating your problems.
But it's an important enough deal
to justify a bit of a risk.
Leave it to me, Your Honour.
Everything will go smoothly.
Just take care of the permits.
Okay, Your Honour. Certainly.
I'll drop by and see you.
My respects, Your Honour.
Ready, sir.
- Here. Goodbye.
- Thanks.
Look how beautiful it is!
Look, it's lovely!
It's like a paradise on earth.
Well, we mustn't fall from grace
here then!
Why not? That's what we came for!
Go, Roberto!
- Hands off!
- I haven't even started yet.
Yes, you have!
- Fetrol, gentlemen?
- Petrol!
You've been here a year
and you can't say it yet!
You Italians only teach us
the dirty words!
Come on, Roberto!
Who cares, we didn't come here
to teach them Italian.
- Don't you like me anymore?
- I'll show you how much!
Look how lonely it is here!
Come on, Robert.
Come on...
We've found a night club, come on!
There's even a dance floor!
Let's go! At least we can dance!
Louise, give me the tape recorder.
Here it is!
Sylvie, put on some music.
It's like a mausoleum in here!
No point trying to set the scene
for some Latin seduction!
This place is more Sibelius
than Puccini!
Hold the culture!
Come on, climb up!
You too!
Great, there's a platform too!
Come on, Robert, let's do the shake!
You and me will do the tango.
The Aleph...
...the one... the all...
the void...
The lines of air, water,
fire and earth
are complete.
Paolo!
You could at least
answer when I call!
Don't yell,
you'll upset the little fellows.
You and your hateful bugs!
It's be absurd to think
you're capable of love.
Me?
I love many things,
but you'd never understand.
We don't understand anything,
right, Ferdinando?
Clouds of blood
are gathering over the bay.
Really? Just think, Ferdinando!
Now what?
The Aleph came out at the end
of the line of fire.
The Zaren was suspended
between the lines of water and air.
The sickle of death
is about to strike!
Oh really, your cards sometimes!
Last week the Aleph
came out first
and gusts of joy
were going to blow over The Bay.
Instead someone hanged
poor Federica!
You're more insensitive
than your beetles!
Can't you feel the chill of
death's icy breath?
All I hear is Ventura holding
the usual orgy in his cottage!
You hate Ventura for the same reason
you hated Federica's husband,
because he enjoys life
and you don't!
The formalin, be careful!
I hate him because he wants to turn
The Bay into a sea of cement.
But I won't let him!
Even if I have to...
- Not dancing, Robert?
- I'm no good at it.
Come on!
I'll take you to a private room.
Stop it! You're tickling me!
I only do it in bed.
And it must be comfortable!
Bourgeois!
I'm coming!
You big, sexy doll!
Come and see the swimming pool!
God, what a stink!
Here I go!
Careful, you'll trip!
I'll dive in!
I'm coming, Roberto!
Are you mad? Want to get typhus?
There might be a corpse in there.
You always say terrible things!
Maybe I found the bed.
- I'm going to swim in the sea.
- You'll get pneumonia.
- You want to die here?
- Let's go. Come on!
- Let's go and find this bed.
- But let's bring Roberto too.
Why him?
Don't leave me with this maniac!
Come on, boys!
What do you want?
Go for a swim!
- In this cold?
- Yes, this cold!
She's used to it. In her country
they eat whale blubber.
- It's like a museum.
- Maybe there's a watchman!
If you're scared, beat it.
Go on, push!
I knew it'd be locked.
Let's not be stupid!
This is private property.
- And the bed?
- Luca will take care of that!
Don't worry. A locked door
won't stop me!
Come on, Luca!
Show us what you're made of!
Don't you like girls?
What is this, a threesome?
- Actually, I...
- You did it, you're fantastic!
Come on, Roberto,
you're invited too.
Where are you going?
Look, yours is in the water.
The bed!
Sylvie,
go check out the bed.
I'll be right with you.
The party's over for you.
You dumped the other one
to bother us? Are you a voyeur?
Here, be a native,
but do it outside!
Where's Roberto?
Just when I've found the bed!
What do you care about Roberto?
I'm here, aren't I?
Leave me alone!
Rapist!
Don't be so rough!
Where are you taking me?
Roberto, is that you?
Roberto, answer me!
Don't fool around!
I found a body!
Hell's bells!
He always pretends he can't hear!
Well, Alberto? Are you coming?
The kids.
It took me half an hour to get them
to go to sleep.
- Why leave the light on?
- You know they don't like the dark.
If you'd listened to me,
they'd be at their aunt's now,
but your sentimentalism...
At that harridan's?
Kids should be with their parents.
Don't start! Think about what
to ask the Fossatis.
Me? I thought I didn't know
how to think!
It's the truth, or we wouldn't
be reduced to this!
Good evening!
Are you Mr Fossati?
I'm Donati's daughter. I'd like some
information about my father.
Is it convenient?
Excuse me, may we come in?
I'd like to talk
to your wife too.
Of course, Filippo Donati's death
threw a very strange light
on dear Federica's death.
Suicide, said the police.
But...
Suicide! Her!
I knew her well.
She clung to life, and how!
And she clung to her
property even more!
As I understand it, what you
actually want to say is that...
...Federica wouldn't have committed
suicide but...
Excuse me if I'm frank,
ma'am, but...
...your father wasn't suited
to this place.
Right, Ferdinando? Drink!
Another drop, and then to bed!
And tomorrow morning
a nice flight in the woods!
Excuse me, but,
you father was... a bit...
you understand?
Women... gambling...
escapades of every kind...
The idea to turn The Bay
into a luxury resort
was always doomed to failure
because, as you can see, dear lady,
this place is full of insects
I imagine that's why the two of you
came to live here then.
My husband believes that even
insects have a soul.
On the other hand,
if Filippo Donati has a soul,
insects also do.
Maybe Renata meant that you
settled here
for the natural life.
Natural or unnatural, one could even
kill one's wife
if it meant would one could
enjoy life more fully.
I came to find out
about my father's disappearance,
not to hear judgement passed on him.
I don't understand
what you're getting at.
Nothing.
Nothing, my dear lady.
I just hope you don't intend
to reopen the night club,
the gas station and all the other
devilries installed by your father
that have almost destroyed
the fauna here.
If you manage to inherit The Bay.
- Remember all that, Ferdinando?
- Ferdinando doesn't remember.
- Ferdinando doesn't remember...
- No!
Inheriting isn't so easy.
Maybe Federica's will
leaves everything to
her biological son.
Biological son?
Yes! Federica did have
her brighter moments.
Didn't you know Simone is the fruit
of her secret love affair?
No, actually.
Who is this Simone?
He lives in a cabin by The Bay.
He's part watchman,
part woodsman, part petty thief.
- Anna!
- What?
He's a good chap, but lately
he's had some strange ideas.
Federica kept him in college
until he was 16.
Then she had him build that cabin
and kept him there like an animal.
A constant reminder
of her weak flesh.
Maybe he knows something
about my father.
I doubt it, he always avoided him.
He didn't approve of your father's
marriage to Federica.
But we should ask him
if he knows anything.
Maybe Franco Ventura
might know something.
He owns the cottage nearby.
He knows your father very well.
It's better not to take the car.
See that path?
lt'll take you straight there.
What did you do
to your hand?
I cut myself with the penknife.
Your father's disappearance wasn't
enough, now there's a son too!
We're even worse off
than before!
If you'd stop whining and use
your brain, you'd find a solution.
- There's no way out.
- There, you've already given up.
There's only one thing
between us and that inheritance.
- What?
- Nothing!
Okay, Simone, tomorrow...
Go and see who they are!
Are you Simone?
No, everything's fine.
Tomorrow we'll celebrate together.
As soon as we get the go ahead,
I'll take a long holiday.
No, you've got to
keep things moving.
I can't right now.
Nothing,
just a little complication.
No, nothing serious.
Come on, don't start!
I said no!
Okay, get all the details
and I'll take care of it.
Okay...
Bye, squonk!
You don't remember
when you last saw Filippo Donati?
You must have had some
dealings with him.
You've lived here for years,
this isn't New York!
He was the owner of The Bay.
But you knew him, right?
You're a man of few words!
It's horrible! It's my father!
I feel sick!
I found him in the sea.
Take her to Ventura's cottage,
it's over there.
Mr Ventura!
Come on, calm down.
Looks like there's no one here.
How are you? Feeling better?
Get the car, hurry!
I heard your wife scream.
We found Donati's body.
- Where?
- In Simone's boat.
- Have you seen my wife?
- Down there, on the path.
That busybody! Anna!
Alberto! Come here, quick!
- Did you see?
- Yes, I did it.
- You did it?
- Why that face?
This isn't the right moment
to get all sensitive!
Stop that idiot before he calls
the police and ruins everything.
- But how?
- Go on, move it!
Go on, go!
Police...
Three... three... two.
Hello? Police?
Three... three... two...
Give me a full tank.
- Is there a 'phone here?
- Yes, it's inside.
- Should I check the oil?
- Yes, thanks.
Stop yelling, are you crazy?
I killed him.
Those two could have saved
themselves...
...if they'd minded their own
business.
Now there are no more witnesses.
You mean that you...
- The wife too?
- Don't be such an old woman!
In certain situations
you have to act decisively.
Old woman?
I just killed a man!
Listen, let's get out of here.
Things will turn nasty.
If you're such a coward as to dump
everything on my shoulders, do it.
I won't give up The Bay
when it's ours for the taking.
But how?
Haven't you understood?
Simone!
We just have to get rid of Simone.
Who's that?
What if she saw us?
We'll do what we have to.
Laura!
- My God! What happened?
- Get Simone, quick.
- But you're wounded!
- Simone!
Bring Simone here, quick!
Don't waste time.
Ventura's wounded, quick!
He needs help!
- Why did you close it?
- You finally came back to The Bay.
What do you mean?
You convinced that bastard, Donati,
to kill my mother.
Your mother?
Me?
Don't play the innocent,
you whore!
Whore!
You drove him to murder!
You wanted him
to marry you at all costs!
You wanted to become
Mistress of The Bay!
But now I'll you
like I killed him!
I had nothing to do with it!
I was dragged into this
against my will.
I didn't want to, let me explain.
I was forced!
It was Ventura, that's the truth.
It was all Ventura's idea.
He wanted to buy The Bay.
It seems immoral to let The Bay
disappear under the vegetation...
...when it could...
- Disappear under cement?
I already suffered enough
over The Bay.
I prefer the chaos of vegetation
over what you'd like to bring here.
But it's not for love of property
that I keep it.
If my house wasn't here,
I'd have sold The Bay long ago.
I assure you that I would retain
it's natural beauty.
I'd only build villas...
very exclusive, modern.
Your reasons are not sufficient
to convert me to modernism.
I already made the mistake
of entrusting The Bay
to someone with
a penchant for modernism.
Excuse me, but your husband...
I don't want to hear another word
about that man!
We could review the price
if that's the problem.
A gentleman would not insist
so much, Mr Ventura.
Excuse me,
it's time for my nap.
- Young lady...
- Countess...
Even the most stubborn
can be persuaded to think again.
"January 8th. I am now sure
that Filippo feels estranged from me.
I agreed to his project
for developing The Bay
in the hope of saving
our marriage.
Instead it's floundering."
Stop it, I don't care about
the Countess' love life.
Here! It was all over between them
on February 13th.
Listen.
"February 13th. It's over.
I'm tired,
my life has no purpose."
Poor thing!
She must have been devastated!
Read that page again.
"It's over. I'm tired,
my life has no purpose."
What is it?
February 13th...
Tell me, didn't Donati
once take a liking to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I met him when you took me
to that night club at The Bay.
It's time to let him start courting
you again.
In fact, you're the one who'll
court him.
What do you intend to do?
It's simple.
Look.
What does it mean?
The Countess is tired of life
and commits suicide.
Suicide?
Yes.
On February 13th,
just like it says here.
On the night of the 13th,
Donati will kill the Countess.
The next day the body will be found
with a suicide note beside it.
Donati inherits the bay
and sells it to me.
Clear?
If Donati falls in love with you,
things could be a lot easier.
He pushed me into
seeing Donati.
Then Ventura intervened himself.
He was the one
who carried out the plan.
That bastard!
And you're worse than him!
I loved that poor cripple!
You killed her
for this shitty bay!
And me... I was stupid enough
to let you involve me
in your dirty deal.
I'll kill you!
Bastards!
I'll kill all of you!
...
There are two more things...
come on.
They're here, I've found them.
What's happening?
Renata, where are you?
Yes?
I didn't think you had it in you.
It's the least I could do
for my family.
We'd better clear out of here.
We'll come back as owners,
when The Bay is legally handed over.
It was lucky we found
my father's body.
Now no one can accuse him
of being a murderer.
All's well that ends well!
Mummy! Daddy!
They're good at playing dead,
aren't they?
Let's go to the bay!
