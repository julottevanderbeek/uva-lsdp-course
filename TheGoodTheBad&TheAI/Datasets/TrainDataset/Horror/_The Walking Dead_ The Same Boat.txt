Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."
That's us, that's the Hilltop.
As soon as the walls were built,
the Savior showed up.
If we go kill Negan,
take out his boys,
will you hook us up?
What the hell
are you doing here?
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to
be someone else!
Lower your gun.
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.
Maggie:
-
-
-
-
You are staying here.
-
- Damn it, Maggie, let's go!
Not until it's done.
- Woman: Stop! Or she's dead.
-
Woman: Guns, knives on
the ground right now.
Nice jacket.
For a murderous bitch.
Woman: Well, we'll take it
off her before we shoot her.
Man: It ain't on there right, I
can feel it. It ain't stopping.
Woman #2: I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.
Man: Son of a bitch, you're
cutting off my circulation.
Woman #2: Well, sport,
it's supposed to.
- Woman #3:
Woman:
Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.
Babe, what's happening?
Lower your gun, prick.
All of you, lower your
weapons right now.
Come on out.
Let's talk.
Woman #2:
Woman:
Too many.
No, we can take 'em.
We took more.
-
- We're not coming out, but we will talk.
Names.
I'm Maggie, she's Carol.
Woman: We've got a
Carol and a Maggie.
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.
Now, we're gonna work
this out right now,
- and it's going to go our way.
-
You can see we have
one of yours.
We'll trade.
-
- I'm listening.
Rick on radio: First I want
to talk to Maggie and Carol,
- make sure they're all right.
-
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.
I'll know if you try
anything else.
Rick, it's Carol.
- I'm... I'm fine, but...
-  Now you.
Rick, it's Maggie.
We're both okay.
- We'll figure thi...
- Shut up.
Woman: You have your proof.
Let's talk.
Rick: This is the
deal right here.
Let 'em go, you can have
your guy back and live.
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.
Rick: You don't
have another choice
or you would've done
something about it already.
We have to get him back.
Primo can take care of himself.
He can patch me up.
I need him,
thanks to that bitch.
You should've shot her in the
head so they could hear her die.
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.
Then make the deal or we go in.
She said shut up, so shut it.
You should be glad
she doesn't have
a sack of gonads to trip over.
- Rick:
Smug prick.
He must think we're stupid.
- That's a good thing.
-
- Rick: Do we have a deal?
-

Paula:
- Paula:
Go to Gamma,
code "fire."
Paula: Alpha channel is not clear.
We follow the protocol.
Paula: Where the
hell are you guys?
Man on radio:
- Man:
Paula: We're headed
to the break point.
Switch to Theta channel,
same code.
If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.
- Man:
-
-
Woman #2:
- Safe house.
-
There ain't nothing safe
about it.
Paula: This place is
gonna save our asses.
Paula:
You're wondering if there's
a way out of this.
There isn't.
Not unless I say so.
- Woman #3:
I want to kill you both
right now.
It's taking all I have not to,
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.
Just see what happens.
When's the last time
anyone checked this place?
Woman #3: It was
fine a month ago.
Woman #2: Sweetie, that was a month ago.
Shit hards quick.
The guns have gone bye-bye,
the food's gone bye-bye,
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.
- Man:
-
-  Carol!
- Woman #3:
- Nowhere.
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.
Those assholes get here
before our people,
the cold bloods
will buy us some time.
-
- Shut up.
Jesus, it's bleeding. It's not
supposed to keep bleeding.
- Molly, give me the rope.
- Man: I'm not losing it.
- Woman #3:
Donnie: Screw you, 'Chelle!
We have to get him back.
He can fix it.
- We have to, Paula.
- No.
I saw them, you didn't.
They took the place down,
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.
Hey!
I'm not going down like that,
not after making it this far.
- Maggie: Hey!
-
What?
She's hyperventilating. Somebody
needs to take her gag off.
She's a nervous
little bird, ain't she?
Look at you.
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.
I can't...
Molly:
You're one of those.
What are you so afraid of?
Are you actually afraid to die?
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.
Just don't hurt Maggie.
Don't hurt the baby.
Yeah, right.
Donnie: She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.
I'm only two months, I think.
You're some kind of stupid,
getting knocked up
at a time like this.
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?
Women used to just die
in childbirth.
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.
Living through it,
why would you just give up?
But are you gonna
live through it?
Anyway, that's cute.
Babies are the point.
Children are our future.
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.
The point is to stay standing.
Walkers do that.
I'm choosing something.
That's right.
You are.
You did.
The baby.
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.
Molls.
Y'all are worse than a bunch
of evangelical second graders.
Those things'll kill you.
They already have.
I'm a dead woman walking.
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.
Ah!
My arm feels like it's on fire.
You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!
Scout crew is coming. They're
Maggie:
His nerves are dying.
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,
maybe his life.
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?
It's time to end this.
You know my problem?
She did this to me.
She did it and she's just
sitting there
right as rain, fully intact.
- Paula:
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.
Paula: No, we wait
for the others.
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.
Then shoot her in the arm, too.
No.
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?
- God damn it!
- Paula:
Donnie:
- Paula:
Leave her alone!
No! No!
You dumb, uppity bitch!
You really are
some kind of stupid.
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.
Should've done that before.
Move.
-
-
You got nice clothes,
time to make babies.
You're holed up somewhere good.
Tell me where.
Don't draw this out, bitch.
Just tell me where.
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.
You're not the good guys.
You should know that.
Molly:
He's in pain.
Guys can't handle pain.
- Carol:
-
Just wanted to say thank you
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.
My husband Ed,
he used to...
Yeah? I don't care
if your old man
used to ring your bell.
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.
I know.
You're pathetic.
You wanna think
we're just the same?
Go ahead.
You're wrong.
He's just a warm body
for my bed.
That's it. I could
kill him in his sleep.
Do you really believe
in that crap?
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.
Maggie:
I stole something.
Got caught.
What?
- Why?
-
Look for my boyfriend's body.
Did you find him?
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.
I barely knew him.
He was a dick.
Frank was my dad.
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
You aren't.
I'm not planning to die today.
Yeah, me neither.
Thing is, one of us is wrong.
Just tell me where.
Rick on radio:
-
- You weren't listening.
I said I'd contact you.
- Rick:
if I said I was sorry
about that?
What do you think?
-
- I think we're gonna make the trade,
We haven't agreed to that.
- Rick:
You know what?
I'm not so sure.
We'd be taking most of the risk,
not getting much
in the way of a reward.
- Rick:
We'll take our chances.
You don't
have to do this.
You don't have to fight.
Your people killed
all of my people.
Of course we gotta fight.
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.
So tell me why.
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,
tried to take everything we had.
They were gonna kill them.
Well, damn.
So now we know what
happened to T's group.
Those idiots.
Probably put on a big show.
Okay, fair play.
You were just
defending yourselves.
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?
They said they were
working for Negan.
And what do you think
you know about Negan?
He sounded like a maniac.
We were scared.
We had to stop him.
Sweetie, sweetie.
We are all Negan.
- What do you mean?
-
What does that mean?
Can I have one?
Well, look at you, little bird.
I didn't think you approved.
I don't.
You are weak.
What are you so afraid of?
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.
I was a secretary before.
I fetched coffee for my boss
and made him feel
good about himself.
I spent most of my days reading
stupid inspirational
e-mails
to try and feel good
about myself.
There was this one
that kept going around.
A young woman
was having a hard time
and told her mom
she wanted to give up,
so her mom went to the kitchen
and started boiling
three pots of water.
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.
After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,
"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.
The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.
The egg was fragile
and came out hard.
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.
See, to me, coffee
was just a thing
No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,
I was at work when
the Army took over DC.
We weren't allowed to leave.
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...
members of Congress,
government employees.
So I was stuck with my boss.
Not my family...
my husband, my four girls...
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die
and he was going
to take me down, too.
He was the first person I killed
so that I could live.
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.
I am not like you.
I'm still me, but better.
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.
You sure about that?
I'm alive.
With those people,
those killers.
That makes you a killer.
You... you're the one.
Excuse me?
You're the one
who's afraid to die.
And you're going to.
You will die.
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.
Are you going to kill me?
I hope not.
-
- Asshole, are you there?
Rick on radio:
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.
Rick:
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"
about two miles
down I-66.
Good visibility
in all directions.
Rick: We'll meet you there.
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.
Paula: No, there was no static.
There should've been static.
They're close.
They're probably already here.
We were careful,
but there were tracks.
-
- No...
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.
They know what they're doing.
They're probably
waiting to kill us
as soon as we walk
out those doors.
- That's what we'd do.
- Carol: No.
You have to listen
to me, please.
Rick is a man of his word.
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.
Then he's just
as stupid as you are.
-
- What's your ETA?
- Man on radio:
- Paula:
We'll fill you up
and then we move.
Radio when you're
back in the perimeter.
- Man:
We gotta get ready.
Pull 'Chelle out so she
doesn't get stuck in a fight.
We have to be ready
to move at any second.
What about the girl?
Leave her for now.
If we leave, we travel light.
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.
Paula: Molls, we need
this hall clear.
Just a sec, sugar.
Are you okay?
I have to be.
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.
No, we should just go.
Carol, we have to finish this.
We have to.
He was already dead.
-
- We should go.
We need a gun.
Give me that.
-
-
Eat shit and die, Donnie!
Where are ya, Magnolia?
I wanna bloody up
that nice...
Agh!
Let's go.
Carol: They're using
them to keep us in,
Maggie:
Just run.
Shoot her.
-
- Go on, do it.
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.
Your people have
destroyed my home.
- Get outta here.
- Carol.
Paula:
The things I've done,
what I've given up,
- Just run.
- Maggie:
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.
-
-
'Chelle:
'Chelle:
You lying bitch!
I'll do it.
You're good.
Nervous little bird.
You were her.
But not now, right?
Me, too.
I told you to run.
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?
I was afraid of this.
Man on radio: Paula, we're
approaching the perimeter.
Man:
Meet us on the kill floor.
I think I might have
killed 18 people.
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.
We're almost done.
Man:
Man #2:
Man:
Man #3:
What the hell?!
Agh!
Maggie.
You okay?
We got your trail.
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.
Hey, you good?
No.
Come here.
They're dead. They're all
dead, the ones that took us.
They're all dead.
Hey, are you okay?
I just...
I can't anymore.
It's okay.
Your friends are dead.
No one's coming for ya.
So you might as well talk.
Let him burn.
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...
how'd you get the bike?
- We found it.
- Daryl: Like hell you did.
We found it.
Was Negan in
that building last night
or was he here?
Both.
I'm Negan, shithead.
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,
so let's have a chat.
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.
