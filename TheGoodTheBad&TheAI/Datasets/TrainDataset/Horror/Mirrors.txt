Oh, fuck!
I wasn't trying to escape.
No, please.
Don't.
Oh, God. I don't want to die.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Hey, sis.
What time is it?
Just after 8:00.
You want me to make coffee?
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.
You sure there's nothing I can do?
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.
BEN: Ben Carson.
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.
BEN: Thanks.
How long you been working here?
LORENZO: All together? Fifteen years.
BEN: You were here for the fire?
LORENZO: Devastating.
Entire building up in flames.
It has been five years since the fire.
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.
Well, there you go.
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.
No electricity.
All these mirrors.
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- BEN: You polish them?
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.
Fellow who was working here before you.
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.
Spent the entire night cleaning them.
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?
About a year.
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I always been too curious.
It's all right.
LORENZO: There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.
Well, here you go.
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.
At least you got electricity in here.
It's warm. It's nice.
You've even got a TV.
Waiting to Exhale.
Hello?
ROSA: Hello.
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.
Thanks.
Where are the kids?
Upstairs with  Ben.
AMY: Thanks.
DAISY: So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.
BEN: You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.
- Hey.
- AMY: Hey.
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?
It's so fast, Mommy.
Ben? Can I talk to you?
Yeah. Okay, you two.
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.
Okay, let's go, Michael.
Hey. Come here.
Happy, happy birthday.
MICHAEL: Thanks, Dad.
BEN: Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What is this?
- What?
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.
You won't answer my calls.
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?
I don't want to know.
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.
I haven't had a drink.
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.
What?
You don't think people can change?
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.
Amy, I killed a man.
You don't just get over that.
I needed time. I needed you.
- I was right here.
- Yeah.
Judging me like everybody else.
How dare you say that to me?
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?
How can you say that to me?
I've always been in your corner!
I've been the only one
who believed in you!
You're fucking unbelievable!
Please, I didn't come here to fight.
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.
I just wanted to see them.
But we have to set up some rules.
What fucking rules?
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow
so I can see my son on his birthday!
Look at yourself.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.
When I get around you, I get nervous.
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.
And I screw everything up.
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.
Amy, we deserve another chance.
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.
Please.
Please.
AMY: I can't do this.
I can't do this, Ben.
Fuck.
Holy shit.
What the hell?
Fuck!
Man.
What the...
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!
How are you doing today?
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.
Are you sure you're all right?
Please, not you.
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.
I'm your little sister.
It's that new job, isn't it?
Yeah, well, I need that new job.
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.
It's not that simple.
Well, you should think about it.
Ben! What happened?
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!
Angie, get out of here! Now!
What is happening to you, Ben?
Pull yourself together.
Help!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...
No!
"Gary Lewis."
Esseker.
Esseker.
Hello?
Hello?
Where are you?
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!
Damn it!
I'm coming!
Anybody here?
Is anybody in here?
Fuck this place.
MICHAEL: Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Mom! Mom!
- AMY: Michael?
Are you okay? What's happening?
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.
Come on. In you go.
I'm right around the corner, all right?
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.
DAISY: Can you leave the door open?
AMY: Sure, sweetheart.
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- DAISY: All right, Mom.
BEN: I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.
You're under a lot of stress.
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,
in the window of every building
in this city.
I feel...
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors
but they're looking back at me.
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.
Maybe you need to talk to someone.
A professional, someone...
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.
There's nothing behind them.
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?
I love you.
Coming!
Hold on!
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.
You want to sign here, please?
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.
Holy shit.
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.
What are you talking about?
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?
Yeah.
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.
AMY: We have a white male,
Following the completion
of the external examination,
the body was washed and lightly dried.
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints
to the xiphoid process.
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- WOMAN: Amy.
Yes, what is it?
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.
Ben.
What's happening?
What are you doing here?
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.
How do you have his driver's license?
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.
Why do you need to know how he died?
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.
I can't explain, but it's...
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.
Thing is, I never met him before.
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.
I need to figure this out. Please.
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.
He slashed his throat.
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?
I didn't think so. Excuse me.
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.
That's why we still have the body.
What did he use to cut his throat?
A piece of mirror.
He probably broke the mirror into pieces
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.
Seven years bad luck.
Esseker.
Are you okay, Ben?
I'm fine.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I need to see his file.
- What?
- I need his file.
- Ben.
- What's the problem?
I just need to see his file.
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?
Look, I'll be off then.
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.
I can't leave here until I see that file.
It's important, please.
Please.
Amy, come here and look at this picture.
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.
It's full of blood.
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.
What are you trying to prove?
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.
Don't you want to get reinstated?
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.
What's wrong with you?
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?
That's a strong drug.
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?
I'm sorry that I bothered you.
You're right.
Thanks for trying to help.
WOMAN: night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.
- LARRY: All right. Where's the body?
- OFFICER: Calm down.
WOMAN:
I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
OFFICER:
Let the detective by. Step over here.
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.
OFFICER: All right.
You say she works at this bar? At night?
WOMAN:
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.
She probably closes the bar, right?
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.
OFFICER: All right.
I saw blood falling
from the ceiling. Then she call me.
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?
BEN: What's going on?
DETECTIVE: One second.
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.
- Just tell me what's going on.
- DETECTIVE: Just a second.
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.
Where's Angie?
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!
No sign of struggle or forced entry.
And the front door was locked,
which means that
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment
or it was someone that she knew.
He would've never laid a finger on her.
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.
She meant the world to him.
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p.m.
And the downstairs neighbors said
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,
that he was planning on quitting the job.
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?
No.
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.
What are you gonna do with him?
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.
AMY: Larry.
I'm so sorry.
Ben?
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?
I can't.
I don't want to put our children in danger.
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?
I've got some things I need to take care of.
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.
He'll never believe me.
Neither will you.
What do you want?
Please, just tell me.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
"Esseker."
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.
- I've already done that.
Nothing. IRS and DMV.
- Try New York.
- Last five or six years.
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead."
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire."
"Watchman arrested."
"Woman, three children murdered."
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children."
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty."
- Yeah. What did you get?
Shit! Shit.
No. Hold on. Hold on.
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.
- Yeah.
- I already know that.
Damn it.
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?
DR. MORRIS: You know, Mr. Carson, when
one starts to perceive one's own reflection
as a completely separate being,
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock
can split the personality in two.
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.
You'll see they speak for themselves.
Oh, my God.
Amy.
Excuse me, I have to go.
ROSA: Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.
Good. I'll be right back.
Dad...
BEN: Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.
Daddy, what are you doing?
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?
AMY: Rosa, what's happening?
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.
What the hell are you doing?
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.
Get out of the house, right now!
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,
I realized they can get at you anywhere.
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.
What's wrong with you?
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!
Michael... He's acting so strange now.
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!
He is six years old. I have to protect him!
I want to show you something.
