ACT I
Report on the great mortality
which prevails in Wisborg
in the year of grace 1838
It is words
lugubrious like the call of a bird of
death.
Take care not to say them or your life
will be populated shades
and the phantoms
which will haunt your dreams
will be nourished of your blood.
I reflected a long time
with the mortality
which had struck my birthplace.
Here its history.
In Wisborg lived Hutter
and his young woman Ellen
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"
"Not so quickly, my young friend!
Nobody escapes from his destiny."
There was certain Knock,
realtor.
All kinds of noises ran on him.
But it paid its people well.
"count Orlok,
the lord of Transylvania...
wishes to buy a beautiful house in our
city..."
"You could earn much money..."
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat...
and perhaps a little blood... "
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."
"This house... opposite yours.
Propose it to him!"
"you start, my young friend,
and made happy voyage
to the country of the phantoms."
"I leave to travel far, to the country
of the robbers and the phantoms."
Hutter left the concerned young woman
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister
"Would be without fear."
After having traversed many dusty roads,
the young person Hutter finally
saw the summits of Carpates
the horses tired.
"I have to eat... quickly.
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"
"do not go further.
there are werewolf  in the wood."
VAMPIRES
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.
It lives in the caves and in coffins,
in the ground maudite of the
cemeteries of Pestiférés
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge,
its fears, that it had entrusted to me,
were not long in materializing.
"You made me wait.
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"
END Of ACT I
ACT II
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"
"do you Want to hold me a little company,
very expensive?
"There remains time until the rising of the sun
and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep."
the paddle dissipated the shades of the
night.
My love! My beloved!
would not be sad to know me with far.
the mosquitos are a true plague,
they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle
but is not worried.
At night,
a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "
To continue its pitiful life
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.
Take guard that its demonic shade
does not torment your dreams.
At the same time
"a doctor... a doctor!"
"a benign congestion."
the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen
to an unknown disease.
But I know that your heart
answered the call of the bird of death.
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.
Hutter sought to include/understand
the terror of its nights.
the boatmen did not know
which terrible burden they went down in the valley.
END Of ACT II
ACT III
"Of the peasants transported it yesterday,
at the hospital.
They say that it made a fall.
It is still feverish..."
"Of the coffins..."
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg.
professor Bulwer,
who studied the secrecies of nature,
had spoken to me about it.
One had charged on Empusa
of the coffins filled with ground.
ship must even take the sea this night
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg
At the same time, professor Bulwer
explained to his pupils
the cruelty of the plants carnivores.
the secrecies of nature
appeared in horrified eyes.
"is not this... like a vampire!"
It seems that the approach of
malfaisant Nosferatu
the realtor had a knock on influence.
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."
"blood, it is the life!"
"See this one..."
"polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "
"A few things close, a phantom..."
"Of the spiders...!"
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of
the dunes.
Its sadness flew away towards its
beloved,
while its eyes scanned the waves and the
horizon.
My love! My beloved!
would not be sad to know me with far.
The mosquitos are a true plague,
they have bitten me around the neck.
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle,
but is not worried
"Now, I must leave...
to regain the house as fast as possible!"
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.
Young people are decimated in mass.
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck
whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.
Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.

the first sailor reached of this disease
involved all the crew with him,
in the black tomb of the waves
The evening, the captain and his second

"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..."
the ship of death had a new captain.
END Of ACT III
ACT IV
In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage
the funeral breath of Nosferatu
inflated the veils of the ship
which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.
"I must join it. It arrives!"
"the Master arrives..."
I wondered a long time
about these coffins filled with ground
that Nosferatu had carried.
the vampires were to rest
in this damned ground
to preserve their diabolic capacities.
"It does not have there heart which lives on board."

Which was still healthy? Who was sick?
