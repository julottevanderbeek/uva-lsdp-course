MAN: Ready? Let's do this!
Come on, you fuckin' zombie!
Yep!
- I'm out!
- Same!
Come on.
Come on!
MAN: I got a story to tell.
Yesterday, I went pig hunting
with my brothers,
Mulla and Tony.
I drove the car.
Tony brought his blues guitar.
Mulla brought
his favourite rifle.
And I brought my mean little
sawed-off pistol-grip 12-gauge.
We went bush.
There was a strange feeling
in the air.
Dead silent.
That night, I... we made a fire.
Like I usually do.
We just sat there,
barely talking.
Then Mulla sees it.
Min Mins. Shooting stars.
Everywhere.
I look up and I see them
lighting up the sky.
And I'm scared.
I get a feeling.
I get a feeling right... here.
That night, it took me ages
to go to sleep.
And when I did,
I dreamed bad things.
I woke up in the morning.
Mulla and Tony were gone.
Then I saw blood trails.
I followed them. I saw Mulla.
He was dead.
I look out into the bush
and I see Tony.
I call out to him.
Tony!
Then he turns.
That's not me brother.
Then he come at me.
And I just run,
yelling at him to stop.
But he just keeps coming!
After a while, I get tired
and I just start walking.
Must have went like that
for hours.
Me walking and him chasing.
Then I turned and aimed the gun.
Took out his legs.
I blew his knee cap off.
Then he starts crawling at me.
I aim for his head.
I couldn't do it.
I shoulda shot him.
Barry.
You got any stories?
This morning, I shot
my wife and child with a nail gun.
I don't know how to make that
into a story.
Uh-uh! Get rid of it.
Wash your hands.
So I told Kaitlyn
that Teah kissed Jason,
but Jason's not officially
going out with Kaitlyn.
Like, they're just friends.
But he also told Angie that they were
'friends with benefits' type deal.
So I don't know
what to believe.
Jason told Max that they were,
like, going steady.
Come on, Meganne.
Hang up the phone.
One second.
So, like, Teah's, like, "Oh, my God,
everyone thinks I'm a slut."
- Meganne!
- Hey!
And I'm just like, "No, they don't."
But they so do.
- Watch your language, please.
- Put your phone away.
I'm talking to Lisa.
I don't care
if you're talking to Jesus.
Off the phone
or you'll lose it.
- Do as you're told.
- I gotta go, Lisa.
Mum's having a hissy fit.
OK. Laterz.
-
- Oh, Barry!
You're a full grub, Dad.
Can you not be a barbarian,
just for three minutes?
- I'm sorry, babe.
-
Meganne, come on. Eat properly.
Night-night.
-
- Stop it!
You're crazy.
-
- Yes.
-
- Yep. Nice, Charlie.
-
- Yes. Nice.
Do that one more time
for me, babe.
-
- Charlie? Shit.
- Hon, what's the matter?
-
- What... the fuck is that?
-
- Charlie? Charlie?
-
-
- Fuck!
Charlie.
-
-
- Yeah?
- Oh, Barry, thank fuck!
Fuck, are you OK?
Is Annie and Meganne safe?
Brooke?
Listen, I don't know
what the fuck is going on.
Everyone is turning crazy.
Cherry and Charlie just turned.
Their eyes!
- Their eyes went fucking white.
- Just slow down.
I had to chop off Cherry's head
with a goddamn shovel.
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.
Where are you?
I'm in the studio
in Bulla Bulla.
Barry, listen, you gotta get
somewhere safe, man.
You gotta get outta the city.
Like, fuck.
Chock?
MEGANNE: Daddy?
There's someone in the kitchen.
Barry...
No, just...
Barry, just wait here.
Just call the police.
Call the cops.
Little help!
Get this thing off me!
Get the axe.
Get the fucking axe!
Go! Hurry up!
What are you waiting for?
Meganne, get in the bedroom!
Go, go!
-
-
- Straight to the car.
- Mm-hm.
Barry, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Shit.
Meganne, get in the back, honey.
- Keep your seatbelt on.
- Good girl, Meganne.
Hold on.
- Shit!
-
- Shit.
- Barry!
- Close your eyes, honey.
MAN: Clear!
The fuck are you doing?
Oi! We can ball-gag ya
or you can shut up.
So just relax.
This is for your own good.
See this?
This is going to go into your neck.
And if you keep struggling,
you're gonna rip up
your own veins.
OK?
Mm-hm.
- Keep it still.
-
-
- Good, good.
That's a good girl.
Is she good?
She's good.
Let's put her out.
What the fuck
did you do that for?
Looks like we're gonna
have to put her out
the old-fashioned way, Sarge.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Meganne, put your mask on.
Get her mask on.
Meganne, sweetie,
you have to put... Meganne?
Barry, stop... Barry, stop the car.
Stop the car!
Meganne! She's not breathing.
- Meganne! Meganne?
- Come on, sweetie. Come here.
Come on.
Barry...
- No, keep that on. Keep it on.
- No. No!
I can feel it.
No!
Here, quick.
Come here.
I love you so much.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Ahh! No!
Darling... stay back.
Stay back!
Stay back!
I'm sorry, baby.
Ooh!
SONG:  Baby, babe,
let's get together
Honey, hon, me and you
And do the things
Oh,
do the things
That we like to do
Oh, do a little dance...
-
-  Make a little love
Get down tonight
Get down

Do a little dance,
make a little love
Get down tonight
Get down tonight...
No.
MAN: Hey!
Turn around.
Turn around, prick.
- Fuck off!
- Hey, hey. Don't.
Fuck!
You're fucking normal.
Shit. Come on.
Mate, they are coming.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, put the gun down.
Mate, it's just us. Don't...
Put it down.
Fuck.
What are you doing, mate?
Give me the gun.
Mate, I don't wanna hurt you.
Just give me the gun.
No.
Give me the gun.
Then fucking shoot me.
You wanna kill yourself?
Alright.
You do it.
SONG:  If you're feeling
down and low...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Put the bat down, alright?
Put it down.
Look, mate, it's just...
Don't hit me with that.
Mate, just put it fucking...
Alright. Here we go.
See? I've got one.
Mate, I don't wanna
do this, OK?
Just put it down. See? Look.
I'll put mine...
There. Nothing.
Yeah?
You don't need it. It's just us.
Who you gonna kill?
Who? Out here? Eh?
Put it down, mate.
Put it down. Yeah?
I need you to get me
to Bulla Bulla.
Alright. Let's go.
There it is. Look, look, look.
Fuckin'...zombie. Eh?
It's just... like, these zombies,
you know, like...
Just fuckin'...
Just fuckin' can't
get used to it in my head.
Fuck it. I'll fight it.
Oi! Where the fuck
are you going?
Oi! Get back in the car!
Oi! Get back
in the fuckin' car.
- Get back. Let's go. Get up!
- Why can't we?
Get in.
Get in the car, idiot!
Get in!
Round 'em or through 'em?
Through 'em.
-
- Fuck. Hey, whoa.
Whoa, fuck. Whoa.
Try that.
Nope. Nothing.
Try now.
Nope.
Hey.
What is it?
Fuck!
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What, is he not a zombie?
No, he's not a fucking zombie!
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck me!
Is he alright? Is he OK?
What do you fuckin' think?
Looks pretty fucking dead to me.
Oh, his head's fucked.
Hey. Try this.
I'm keeping this.
You coming or what, mate?
Lead the way.
Booyah!
Why are you awake?
Ah! They're playing my song.
Will you excuse me?
-
-
Good morning, sir!
Ah!
-
-
I'm just fuckin' with you.
No, you're just due
for another top-up.
No.
Now, you are one
lucky, lucky, lucky little girl.
'Cause you've stayed up
past your bedtime,
you get to see what
the adults do after dark.
Now, hold still.
Hold... still!
If I get this wrong,
you could go into a seizure and die.
Huh?
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
That's a good girl.
We only have to do this
five more times.
I want that truck.
Oi! Oi!
Can we come inside?
There's fuckin' zombies
everywhere!
Yeah, OK.
How do we get in?
Alright!
Let 'em get close to ya,
then run around 'em.
OK.
Just make sure
that door comes up.
Run, ya bastards!
- Nice shootin', Ned.
- Thanks, mate.
Yeah, there's a lot of good shit
in here we can use, eh?
What's that, mate?
That HiLux out the front-
which one of youse owns it?
That HiLux ain't goin' nowhere.
Yeah? Why's that?
You drove from the city, right?
- Right.
- Where's your car?
Broke down.
Engine trouble?
Yeah. Right.
I need to show you boys
something.
Petrol, metho, kero. Alright?
Last time I checked,
they were flammable liquids,
weren't they?
- How old's that stuff?
- Brand-spanking-new, mate.
- We bought it last week.
- So your car just stopped, eh?
Guess that'd explain it.
What the fuck?!
Who's that?
That's Neville.
Oh!
Oh, that's fuckin' rank!
- He's fartin' out of his mouth!
- It's weird, eh?
Oh, fuck it.
'Night, Neville.
- Ooh, shit!
- What the fuckin' fuck?
The bloods flammable!
Oi! Wake up, Neville.
Come on.
- We need petrol, right?
- Right.
Wrong. We need fuel.
There's no way that could work.
There's one way to find out.
Let's get him out of there.
Righto, Kel,
give it a crack now.
Fuck!
Come on!
- You beauty!
- Good on ya, Neville!
If we can get that truck inside,
we can definitely hook him up,
drive the fuck outta here.
That's gonna be
a mission, but, eh?
Yeah, but it's doable.
We need to armour up.
Big-time.
Fuck yeah!
They're going for it!
- Ready?
- Born ready!
Right. Let's do this!
Come on, you fuckin' zombies!
- I'm out!
- Same!
It bit it off! That thing
bit me fuckin' nose off!
Frankie, how does it look, mate?
Is me nose gone?
Is it bit off?
Tell me, Frankie!
Yeah, there's not much
nose left, mate.
- Kel!
- What is it?
Your fuckin' eyes, mate!
What about me fuckin' eyes, Frankie?
What's up with 'em?
- Move out of the way, Frank.
- Wait!
Wait! What are you
fuckin' doin'?
- He's gonna turn any second.
- He's a mate!
Get the fuckin' rope, Frank!
This is bullshit.
What the fuck is that?
This, my friend,
is a gas-powered harpoon.
I built it for a mate
so he can hunt sharks in Perth.
- Is that thing legal?
- Don't be stupid!
Does it work?
I'd move out of the way
if I were you.
Fuck me! Bullseye!
Once that door goes up,
that's it, we're on our way.
Has everyone got
everything they need?
- Yep.
- Ready as we're gonna be.
Righto.
Wait a minute. Frank?
- Yeah, mate?
- Did you turn the stove off?
Right. Let 'er rip, Benny.
Hey!
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?
Fucking kicked me in the balls!
Get him up on the wall
and get out of my lab, you moron!
You call me a moron again,
I'll fuckin' drop ya.
By which you'll be demonstrating
your superior intellect.
Good comeback.
These people! Honestly!
-
-
Hmm.
Hmm.
Oi.
Should we stop for petrol?
I need to piss.
I need to piss.
You're gonna have to wait, mate.
Barry, that means
"Pull the truck over so I can urinate."
Can't you hold on?
We're nearly there.
Just be quick.
Mate, take the rifle.
Frank, I'm just
taking a piss, mate.
- Take the fuckin' rifle.
-
Fuck.
I can't hold a rifle
and my massive cock
at the same time, Frank.
But if you wanna come out
and hold one of 'em,
I'll be flattered, mate.
Fuck off!
- Come on, Benny. Hurry up.
- Don't pressure me, Barry.
It's gettin' dark out here.
Whoo!
- Hurry up, Benny,
-
-
- What the fuck?!
Ahh!
Get back in the truck,
ya fuckin' idiot!
So, what did you learn?
- Never get out of the truck.
- Let's get out of here.
You, uh, gonna put
your cock away first?
- No!
- Alright.
Oh, you're fuckin' jokin'!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- They're not makin' any gas.
- He's empty, you reckon?
Nah, he's not empty.
Have a look at 'em.
Last night,
was Neville breathing the gas?
No. That only really
started up this morning.
It's getting dark, eh?
Yeah.
They stop
breathing the gas at night.
That's why they're faster.
They're using it themselves.
We're fucked!
Boys! Get in the fuckin' truck!
Get in the truck, Frank.
Get in the truck.
Get your helmets on.
Oh, fuck me.
It's gonna be a long night.
What do ya reckon, Frank?
This the worst fuckin' nightmare
of your life or what?
No fuckin' way, mate.
What the fuck
could be worser than this?
About 15 years ago,
a doctor told me
me son had brain cancer.
He was only seven years old.
Talk about shitting yourself.
He died in my arms.
That was way worse than this.
This is fuckin' nothin'.
Sorry to hear
about that, Frank.
Yeah, well,
these things happen, eh?
Baz?
So, what I've been
wondering is...
...how come we're not like them?
How come we never turned?
Wormwood.
- What?
- You never read the Bible?
Nah, man.
I don't read that shit.
In Revelations, when the third angel
blows his trumpet,
a star called Wormwood
falls to the earth
bringing a disease
that kills a fuckload of people.
That's pretty much the beginning
of the end, biblically speaking.
When I seen those
meteor showers last night,
and then in the morning,
all these dead bastards
come running out of the bushes,
I figured we were pretty deep into
that final judgment, you know?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And when the end comes,
all the good folks go upstairs
and all the bad folks
go downstairs
and there's a bunch of
poor bastards left in the middle.
What happens to them?
Well, they undergo
a trial by fire.
They get tested by God.
You reckon
we're being tested right now?
Yeah. I reckon we are.
I fuckin' hate tests.
I'm gonna
try and get some sleep.
If one of them bastards
gets in here and kills me,
wake us up, will ya?
Uh! What the fuckin' fuck's
going on?
- Fuck.
- Is that fire?
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I shot one in the face
and the fucker lit up.
What'd you do that for?
If that fire reaches the compressor,
we're stuffed.
You think I don't
know that, Frank?
- I'm going up there.
- No, you're fuckin' not!
There's a shitload of
them things out there, mate.
What else am I gonna do?
Look, I'm gonna go out there
and put the fire out.
- Fuck those things!
- Take the helmet.
Put it on!
Let's do this.
Fuck you!
You ugly fuckers!
- Shit.
- Barry!
What the fuck's going on?
Fuck!
Barry!
-
- I'm alright.
Lock it!
Shit!
Ah! Fuck!
Fuck!
Frank! Did it bite ya? Frank!
Did it bite ya, mate?
- The medical box!
- Eh?
The fuckin'...
The fuckin' medical box at your feet!
Oh. You want some bandages.
Open it!
Oh, beers.
You want a beer, Frank?
What do you fuckin' reckon?
Take a drink.
Take a fuckin' drink!
Gimme some.
I can't do it.
I'm Catholic. I can't do it.
Come on, mate!
It's OK. It's alright.
I've had a good life.
Just make sure you do it
while I'm still me.
I'm really sorry, mate.
Fuckin' do it!
Mind if I finish this?
Oh, fuck, man.
Fuck off, meathead!
Oh! Think I'm gonna spew!
Got a pounding hangover.
Oh, nice one!
Give me a hand with Frankie.
Come on.
-
- Nice one!
Let's get the fuck
out of here, eh?
Yeah.
Let's do it.
You gonna say something?
What's there to say?
What was that?
He's safe now.
That crow will come
and take his spirit.
Nice.
Come on. Let's go.
You boys military?
Yeah.
Do you guys know
what's been going on here?
- You fellas A-negative?
- What?
Course they're fuckin'
A-negative, Thommo.
What's he talking about?
All we know is there is something
in the air that's changing people.
Anyone with an A-negative
blood type is unaffected.
That's obviously you fellas.
People with any other blood type?
Not so lucky.
So, where are you boys headed?
- North.
- We're going to Bulla Bulla.
Bulla Bulla? Why?
To get his sister.
That's a pretty bad idea.
We've just come from Bulla Bulla.
It's not looking good.
There's infected everywhere.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, fellas.
Alright, look,
we're all friends here, OK?
We got a call from our captain
about 10 minutes ago.
Now, he's in a roving unit
just down the road, OK?
Now, he said he picked up
a couple more
A-negative blood types.
Survivors, just like you two.
What was your sister's name?
Brooke.
Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure
one of 'em was Brooke.
Well, how about I go and radio our
captain and confirm that for you, eh?
Yeah, you do that.
Well, they've definitely
got a Brooke.
Well, I wanna speak to
whoever's on that radio.
Listen! Now, you hear me out.
Just relax.
Hop back in your car
and I will take you to your sister.
Just tell me where she is.
Look, mate, I don't even
have time for this shit, alright?
There are about a million things
I have to do right now.
And you boys,
you're pretty low on my priority list.
So hop back in your car
and you follow me - or don't.
Your choice.
Thommo, we're rolling.
Well? What's it gonna be?
We'll follow you.
They seemed like nice blokes!
Or not.
I don't like it.
Don't like what?
Dunno.
But that guy's full of shit.
Brooke!
It's time.
Hmm.
Hmm.
YOU!
What the fuck?
Those lying fucks.
That's Brooke!
- Brooke!
- Barry?
Shit.
Quick, jump!
Jump!
- Quickly!
-
- Shit!
- They're shootin' at us!
Go, go, go!
Hold on!
Whoo-hoo!
- Fuck!
- What's that sound?
- Come on!
- What's the problem?
I don't know.
-
- You OK?
What happened back there?
Oh, fuck me dead! Barry!
They blew this joker's head off!
Shit.
We need to find a zombie fast.
Zombie? What do we
need a zombie for?
This truck runs on zombies.
No zombies, no truck.
Come on, you dead bastards!
Come and get it!
Where are ya?
You want a zombie?
Yeah.
- I'll get you a zombie.
- BARRY: Fuck!
Brooke, what the fuck's wrong
with your eyes?
Don't shoot him!
-
- Shit!
Alright, what the fuck
just happened then?
Where do you want him?
Back of the truck.
She can control
fuckin' zombies!
What?
- Come on!
-
What the fuck
are we waiting for?
We need the fucking mask
over that thing's mouth!
- What mask?
- The blue fucking mask!
OK, go!
Mulla! Mulla!
The joke's on me now, bro.
You OK?
Nah, I'm fucked.
Ahh! What the fuck
are you doin'?
I'm putting pressure on the wound.
It'll stop the bleeding.
Just fuckin' warn me
next time, eh?
Sorry.
You're better-looking
than your brother.
So are you.
I'm Brooke.
I know. I'm Benny.
Thanks for helping me out
back there, Benny.
No problem, darlin'.
Nice to finally meet ya.
I wish I could say
I heard a lot about ya,
but your brother there
is a bit of a tight-lipped bastard.
Yeah.
I guess it runs in the family.
Hey, Barry?
Where's Annie and Meganne?
They're dead.
My brother Mulla,
he's up there in the trees,
laughing at me, the bastard!
Barry, we're gonna have to pull over.
Benny's not good.
Fuck.
Alright.
I'm gonna pull off-road.
There you go, mate.
It's a nice day for it.
Oi. I want you
to leave me here, bro.
- Don't be stupid.
- Listen to me!
Just give me a gun
and plenty of bullets.
- I can take care of meself!
- I know you can, mate.
But there's no bloody way
I'm leaving you here.
Now, let's take a look
at this thing, eh?
Shit.
You two gotta keep moving.
You know that!
Fuck that bullshit.
Now, we're gonna patch you up
and we're all leaving here together.
Nah! I'm not getting
back in that truck!
- Yeah, you are!
-
- Brooke?
-
Brookie?! Shit.
Brooke!
You alright?
Oh, God. Fuck me, no.
Somethings happening to me.
Come here.
I killed them both.
Could you do it for me?
I don't know if I can.
Give me the gun.
You hold my hand?
Give me the gun. Run! Go!
Come on, fuckheads!
MAN: Wakey-wakey.
Call to your sister.
Go fuck yourself.
Thompson?
-
-
Rubber bullets.
They pack quite a punch,
though, don't they?
You wanna know
what the real one feels like, mate?
The real one
feels like shit, Barry.
Call to your sister.
No, she'll be right.
Go and get the pliers.
Call to your sister.
Fuck you!
Fuck me!
Ever seen 'em move that fast
in the daytime before, boss?
- McGlaughlin?
- Yes, boss.
- Take another nail out.
- Stop!
Shit.
Put 'em on.
Oh, fuck this shit. Come on!
Leave her alone,
ya fuckin' bastards!
Shut up, dickhead!
Easy, easy.
Sorry about him.
Listen up!
They want us to take the girl's head off
and chuck it in the icebox for later.
Fuck yeah!
Actually, boss,
I've got just the thing for this.
- It's over in the truck.
- Go and get it now.
Hey, Benny.
You got those matches
on you, mate?
- Yeah.
- Give me 'em, hey?
Why?
- I'm gonna take us all out.
- Hey?
See that compressor up there?
I'm gonna blow it up.
Be like a fuckin'
atom bomb went off.
Can we talk about
a possible alternative?
Got no time, mate.
We're dead anyway.
You know that.
- I got a better idea.
- Fuck's sake. What?
I let him up there bite me.
What the fuck
are you talking about?
I've got a number-7
killer boomerang
hidden under the truck,
sharp as fuck.
- A boomerang?
- Yeah.
Your sister,
she can control zombies.
Yeah, so?
So, I'll be... a zombie.
No.
That bloke she killed
over there.
His gun.
- What?
-
Benny, give me
the fucking matches. Now.
You want a head taken off?
You use a fuckin' sword.
Where the fuck
did you get that?
Who cares? Let's get this done.
Fuck yeah, boss.
Leave her alone,
you fuckin' bastards!
Don't touch her!
Benny, they're about to
chop my sister's fuckin' head off.
Give me the fucking matches!
- What about my idea?
- What about your idea?
You're rambling.
You're not making any fuckin' sense.
- I'm rambling, am I?
- Give me the fucking matches.
McGlaughlin, you help me hold her.
Thompson, you're cutting.
- With pleasure, boss.
- You want the matches?
Fuck's sake! Now!
Here's the matches.
Fuckin' wanker!
Come on!
Kill me, you bastard!
You're going down, ball-buster.
-
-
One.
Two.
Three.
Drop the gun or they attack.
Nooo!
Nooo! Nooo!
You fuckers!
Oh, fuck!
I'm guessing you're not
an A-negative blood type, mate.
You're done, son.
Just a matter of time.
Well played.
There's more at stake here
than you know, mate.
It's not about you
or your sister.
Or your mates.
It's about the survival
of the human fuckin' race, mate.
- Do you understand?
- You're a piece of shit.
You wanna fight me, mate?
I wanna rip
your fucking head off.
Fuck it. You and me
go round and round.
Come on, then.
