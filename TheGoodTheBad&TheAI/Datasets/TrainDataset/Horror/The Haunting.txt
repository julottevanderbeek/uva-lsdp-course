Now, I'm trying to tellyou...
that we can'tafford
tokeepyouhereanymore.
Youalreadyowe twomonths
worth ofback rent.
It's mine,
and you're not taking it away.
Read the will, Nell.
It states, in plain language:
''The executorshallhave
theright to dispose of...
any and all personal property
as he shall see fit.''
- He's not even real family.
- Yeah, well, maybe not.
But clearly, Mother thought Lou
would be much better equipped...
to deal with these
unpleasant details than you.
'' Unpleasant details'' ?
Whathave Ibeen dealing with
forthepast 1 1years ?
I've cooked, cleaned, mopped up
her urine ! You call that
an ''unpleasant detail'' ?
- Hey, your sister
didn't write the will.
- We all know whatyou've done.
- We're trying tohelp.
- Do not help me !
-
-
Oh, Ritchie.
Just go sit on the couch, okay ?
- Oh.
-
Anyway, onceprobate closes,
we canput this apartment
on themarket,
andweallmightbeable
tomakea fewbucks.
Also, we know how much you love
Mom's car, so we're giving it toyou.
You're taking away my home
and giving me a 20-year-old car ?
Absolutely. We'll deduct the value
from theproceeds oftheapartment.
Who areyou ?
Doyou understand
that I have nowhere to go ?
We've been talking,
and Lou and I are very busy.
We could use someone to help us
with the cleaning and the cooking,
looking after Ritchie ?
Eleanor, help me. I gotta pee.
-
-  Ritchie, notnow!
Get outta my home.
Well, suityourself.
We'll let the courts handle it.
Get out ofmy home.
Honey, let go. That's right.
Oops. Sorry. Okay.
Hereyougo, honey.
FollowDaddy.
Come live with us, Nell.
You have no idea
how hard it is out there.
No,Jane. You have no idea
how hard it was in here.
Hello.
Yes, this is Eleanor.
- Where ?
-
Iseeit.
'' Research subjects.
Nine hundred a week.''
Here'showthey're organized. Thegroups
have very differentpersonalities.
Scored all over the KierseyTemperament
Sorter,just likeyou asked for,
andtheyallscore veryhigh
on theinsomnia charts.
Oh, what a beautiful profile.
A classic dependent
personality disorder.
However, we were looking
for ''suggestible.''
Hermotherdied
twomonths ago.
She reallywants to do this.
And what areyour feelings,
Mary ?
Tell me what
your intuitions say.
I put my favorites
on top.
Mm-hmm.
What else have we got here ?
''Lowself-esteem,
highnarcissism,
chronic feeling ofemptiness,
identity disturbance. ''
Good, good. Verygood.
Is this where we're going ?
That's Hill House.
That's perfect, isn't it ?
- The Hill House Project--
- Is absolutely essential
to my research, Malcom.
No,just listen.
I grantyou,
fear and performance
is a big, sexy idea.
- But as chairman
ofthis department, I cannot--
- I knowyou clinical guys...
don't like to ask these questions,
but think about it.
What is fear, anyway ? It's a series of
automatic responses to a given stimulus,
characterized by increased
heart rate, respiratory activity
and adrenaline function.
The only problem with fear
is that it has largely become
inappropriate and nonadaptive.
Do sweaty palms
help to talk toyour boss ?
Does a racing pulse help
some kid's score on an SAT ?
And yet we carrywith us
these primordial fear responses...
that do the opposite ofwhat
theywere intended to do.
- So why is that ?
- David, David, no one is saying...
that these aren't
provocative questions.
Butyou can't conduct this research
ethically or responsibly.
And on top ofthat,
you're bringing your insomniacs...
to this house
under false pretenses.
Because the experiment needs
a credible cover story.
Calling it an insomnia study...
allows me to create a highly
suggestive environment...
to investigate
the dynamics offear.
You don't tell the rats they're
actually in a maze, Malcom. Come on.
What doyou want ?
Are-- Areyou Mr. Dudley,
the caretaker ?
Yeah. I'm Mr. Dudley, the caretaker.
What areyou doing here ?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.
I'm supposed to see Mrs. Dudley.
Is she here ?
-
- What doyou think ?
Why doyou need
so many chains ?
That's a good question.
What is it about fences ?
Sometimes the people on either side
ofthe fence see a locked chain,
they feel
a little more comfortable.
Why doyou suppose that is ?
-
-
Mrs. Dudley ?
Hello ?
Mrs. Dudley ?
Hello ?
Hello ? Mrs. Dudley ?
-
- Oh, my--
I'm-- I'm, uh--
I'm EleanorVance.
- I'm here with the--
- Dr. Marrow's group.
You're the first.
Yeah, I'd-- I'd heard a sound,
and that's--
It's make the dinner or answer the door.
Can't do both.
- Areyou Mrs. Dudley ?
- So far.
I'll showyou your room.
This way.
The Red Room.
You're going to be the first visitors
Hill House has had...
- since Mr. Crain died.
- Really ?
These are beautiful.
I know. I've seen 'em.
It's a lot to dust.
I've never seen
this kind ofbeauty.
You must love working here.

Hi. Don't worry.
I'm notan obsessivepacker.
It'sjust asking people to help me
schlepp this stuffis a cheap...
and exploitative way
ofmaking new friends.
- Here. I'm Theo.
- Hi.
Eleanor,
but everyone calls me Nell.
Well, Everyone Calls Me Nell,
don'tyou love it here ?
I love it. Sort ofCharles Foster Kane
meets the Munsters or something.
- I likeyour boots.
- You do ? Aren't they great ?
Prada. Milan, not New York.
But they're killing me.
Hey, small price to pay
for such savage kicks.
Wow. Oh, my God.
Oh, this is so twisted.
Seriously twisted.

I thinkwe share

Oh, don't worry.
I probablywon't be in here much.
- Light sleeper.
- That's why we'rehere.
- What doyou do, Eleanor ?
- I'm betweenjobs right now.
The last person I was workin' for,
it ended. Over, so-- And you ?
Well, that depends.
I'm supposed
to be an artist,
but I've been distracted
from work by love.
- You know what I mean ?
- Mmm, not really.
Hey, don't tell me Boston's
different from New York.
Oh, you mean you have trouble
with commitment.
Well, my boyfriend thinks so,
my girlfriend doesn't.
Ifwe could all live together--
But they hate each other.
Hello. The bag.
You know, it's hard when
you're the only one at the party.
- You know what I mean ?
- No.
A blank canvas.
I could paintyour portrait
directly on you.
Or maybe not.
So, what aboutyou ?
Husbands ? Boyfriends ?
Girlfriends, Eleanor ?
Where doyou live ?
Mmm. I don't have anyone.
But I do have
a little apartment ofmy own.
It has a little flower garden.
Youcanjustsee the ocean.
Andwhen the wind...
comes injust right,
you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Wow.
That sounds really nice.
You're lucky.
Butyou know that, right ?
Oh, sorry.
Just a little hair.
So, show me the bathroom !
Oh, it's really beautiful.
It is huge.
- Oh, my God !
- This is the bathroom.
- Look at this bathtub.
Can you believe it ?
-
Look at that. Wow !
Look at my bedroom, though.
- Isn't it beautiful ?
- Yes.
- You'vegot tosee the GreatHall.
- Uh-huh.
I mean, there's so much carving.
It's everywhere.
- I know.
- Oh, look at this one.
- Isn't this one great ?
- No, that's creepy.
Oh, and this one.
This one's weird.
Well, you don't get this
from the Martha Stewart catalog.
Idon'tlikeit.
Isn't it based on
The Gates ofHell by Rodin ?
Well, it's notjust hell. See, the
children, they're reaching for heaven,
but theirsouls
are trappedinpurgatory.
And these are the demons...
who can hold on toyour soul
for as long as theywant.
Did you study art ?
No, I studied purgatory.
I was there once for 1 1 years.
It's when your soul is caught
between the living and the dead.
Oh, yeah, I've been there.
It's an 1 8-hour flight from L.A.
to Paris, and you're stuck in coach.
Doyou see ?
Well, let's not stand here.
Come on.
Okay.
Whoa.
- Is it real ?
- No.
- Shall we go in ?
- Yeah.
Wow !
Whoo!
- Wow !
- Wow !
-
-
It'sbeautiful!
Oh !
- Would you care to dance ?
- Yes.
I'm starting to like this house !
This is great !
Let's get outta here.
God ! We're like rats--
rats in a maze.
Oh, God !
IfI ruin these boots--
Jesus, they cost me
a fortune.
-Let'sgoback.
-It's gotta be through here.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scareyou.
I'm Luke Sanderson,
just a bad sleeper.
Basic tosser-turner.
And you are ?
- Nell Vance.
- What kind ofsleeper ? Nightmares ?
- Not really.
- Anxiety attacks ?
No. Uh-uh.
Okay.
Obsessive indecision.
Wow. And you ?
Let me think.
You, I'm gonna guess,
are a--
Don't even start.
Wow, you're so dominant.
Thanks. Theo.
Hey, Theo.
Jesus.
Here we are.
- Hey.
- You're Luke.
- Yup.
- You're Theo. You're Eleanor.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Marrow.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
- Hello, Dr. Marrow.
- Hi. This is Todd. He'sjust come up.
- Greetings, fellow insomniac.
Mary Lambetta, my assistant.
So how was your drive, Eleanor ?
- It was fine. Yeah.
- Good. Good.
Welcome to Hill House, everyone.
Come on.
Allright.
Let thegoodtimes roll.
Doyouknow what ?
Therestofyoumayhateyourinsomnia,
Doyouknow what ?
Therestofyoumayhateyourinsomnia,
but I'm not sure
I want a cure for mine.
That's when I get all my best ideas,
when I'm waiting to fall asleep.
I'm alone, occasionally,
with no distractions,
my mind's racing
with creative ideas,
and come 3:00 a.m.,
I feel like a genius.
Areyou kidding me ?
like I'm losing my mind, watching those
infomercials on psychics...
or listening to Tony Robbins
and the psychic hot lines.
-Haveyou ever seen that late-night TV ?
-Oh, yeah. Thankyou.
I swear to God.
You get a steady diet ofthat crap,
and pretty soon you start thinking
about movin' to Montana...
- and becomin' a survivalist.
-
That's why God
created barbiturates, honey.
- Nembutal ?
- Mm-mm.
No, Todd, I thinkwe have
a classic Seconal woman on our hands.
- In fact, I think I see
a littleJackie Susann in Theo.
-
- Ow.
-Allright, you two.
- Enoughaboutpharmaceuticals.
-
So, look,
what do we all need in life ?
- What are the basics ?
Food, water, shelter.
- Sex.
Andsleep. Sleep.
I'm working on a five-year study,
with the help of Mary here,
making profiles
ofbad sleepers.
I'm looking for
a commonpsychologicallink.
Ihope that the work we dohere
willsomedaybeable tohelp
otherpeople likeyourselves.
God knows I'm all for helping people,
saving the world,
but doesn't everybody have
a problem sleeping these days ?
Life's too frantic.
What aboutyou, Nell ?
Um, well, it seems that
you all have trouble sleeping,
becauseyour lives
are exciting,
and it's complicated, and you think
about it when you go to sleep.
But, um, I don't know.
Nothing's ever really happened to me,
so I don't have a reason
to sleep badly.
But in your application
you said you had trouble sleeping.
Mm-hmm, yes,
but it's not like them.
It's because, uh, there was
always somebody calling me,
there was always
somebody banging.
Ever since I was little,
I took care ofmy mother.
And-- And she would wake up
in the middle ofthe night.
She would bang with her cane
on the wall.
And it wasjust
this relentless--
it was a relentless banging
all through the night.
That's weird, because even though,
uh, she's dead,
I still hear it
and I wake up.
Well, that's whywe're here,
Eleanor-- to try and helpyou.
Yeah, Nell. I thinkwhat Dr. Marrow's
trying to say is...
thatyou're a basket case,
just like the rest ofus.
Thankyou, Mary.
Okay. Okay.
Whyare wehere ?
Really, toanswer
themostbasicquestion::
- What is wrong with you people ?
-
Thesearestandard
cognitiveandperception tests.
I'llbegivingyoua varietyofthese
during the course ofthe week.
Youarenotin competition,
so donot worryaboutbeing
theheadofthe class, okay ?
Between all these tests,
you'll have each other--
Todd-- and the house
to keepyou company.
Luke. Eleanor.
- But we can't go to town.
- No.
And as you were told, there's no
telephone service, there's no TV.
And the caretakers tend to lock the gate
when they leave. However,
I do have my trusty cell telephone,
in case ofemergencies, okay ?
And, um, what's the deal with
the Addams Family mansion ?
Because, I gotta be honest,
- I don't get a real strong
sleep vibe from this place.
- No. Me too.
I wantedtomakesure
youdidn'tsleep too easily.
-  Congratulations.
- Seriously, isolation is essential...
in the creation
ofan experimental model.
This house, who built it ?
Who lived here ?
Well, actually, thatmakes
fora verygoodbedtimestory.
Once upon a time,
there was a king who built a castle.
His name was Hugh Crain.
A hundred and thirtyyears ago,
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center ofAmerican industry.
That's where Crain
made a fortune--
on the backs ofworkers
in his textile mills.
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,
but what he wanted
more than anything...
was a house filled
with the laughter ofchildren.
That's why there are
all the carvings.
Hemarriedthemostbeautiful
womanin town, calledRene,
andhebuiltherthishouse,
oratleastsome ofit.
God, it sounds like
a fairy tale or something.
But that's where the fairy tale ends.
HughandRene
wouldhaveno children.
They all died at birth.
Then, a fewyears later,
Rene, she passed away,
and Crain became
a total recluse.
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.
It's as ifhe was--he wasbuilding a
home forthe familyhe wouldneverhave.
No one had seen
Crain foryears.
But the townspeople said
that sometimes at night...
they could hear sounds
coming from the old house.
Sounds ofchildren.
So sad.
-
- Ooh !
-Jesus Christ !
Christ, I need a drink.
-
- I think there's more to that story.
I can feel it.
I-It's all around us.
It's in the ceiling.
It's in the walls.
It's in the furniture.
It's in this.
- Mary !
- Oh,Jesus. Oh, no.
- Oh,Jesus Christ.
- All right.
What happened ?
Let me see. Oh, my God !
- Keepyour hand away from it.
- Don't touch it.
- What wereyou doing ?
- This'll stop the blood
from getting into her eye.
Mary, we're going to getyou
to the hospital straightaway.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
- Come on.
-
Three steps.
Please!
It'sallright. It'sallright.
- Careful. Be careful.
- Here's the gate key to get back in.
You have my cell number. Call me
the second you've spoken to a doctor.
- All right, Dr. Marrow.
- Hey, I wantyou guys
back as soon as possible.
- Okay, Mary ?
- Okay.
You'll be all right.
She almost lost her eye.
Almost.
Luke, there's something
about the house,
about Hugh Crain
that I didn't say.
- May I askyou not to tell the women ?
- Yeah, yeah.
- It'sjust I didn't want
the tests disturbed.
- Okay, sure.
Hey, you guys, wait up.
Okay. You guys wanna hear something
really scary ? I just found this out.
Turns out there's a darker chapter
to the Hugh Crain fairy tale.
Remember his lovelywife,
Rene ?
Well, Rene, the town beauty,
she didn'tjust die. She killed herself.
- Really ? Hejust told you that ?
- Yes.
And you can't say anything,
'cause he actually swore me to secrecy.
-Why did she kill herself?
-Well, there are the stillborn children,
although I like to think
it was more sinister,
like maybe Hugh Crain was
a horrible monster and drove her to it.
Monster ? But he built this house
for the woman that he loved,
like the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace.
It was a tomb.
And equally overdone.
- Why didn't he tell us ?
- Maybe he doesn't trust women.
Yeah.
I think that's probably it.
I think he knew thatyour fragile,
delicate sensibilities--
After all, you know, I'm a man.
I can handle this kind of--
How'd she kill herself?
He didn't say.
Oh, and ladies,
sleep tight.
Jesus.
After dinner and the first bland history
of Hill House successfully relayed,
Miss Vance appears most susceptible
to suggestive history,
evincing a strongly sentimental reaction
to the love-story component.
Mr. Sanderson, who tested at the bottom
ofthe Mogel Reliability Scale,
was given the second part
ofthe story.
Whenhepasses thestoryon,
the experimentalhaunting fiction...
shouldmanifestitself

AnddearMary
almostlostan eye.
I like the way
you combyour hair like that.
Here. This is foryou.
- For me ?
- Yeah.
It's beautiful.
- No, I'll-- I'll do it.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Mm-hmm.
- Looks good on you.
- Mm-hmm.
You've been out ofthe world
a long time, haven'tyou ?
Yeah.
Well,
the world's missed you.
Happy tossing and turning.
Eleanor.
NowIlayme down tosleep.
Ipray the Lord
mysoultokeep.
IfIshoulddie
before I wake,
Ipray the Lord
mysoulto take.
-
-
- God ! You scared the f--
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you gotta be careful.
- Areyou all right ?
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Youjust don'tjump out--
- Areyou all right ?
- Uh, yeah. N-N-No. Oh !
- What's with the, uh, glove ?
- What ?
- What's with the glove ?
- No, I couldn't sleep.
I wasjust-- Insomnia.
- What's with--
- Ah, well--
- Yeah, you gotta be careful, 'cause I--
- I wasn't. I wasjust--
No, I know.
I'm sorry. I just--
- Oh !
- Um, interesting group, huh ?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was good.
Kind of-- I like Theo.
She's...
quite an insomniac.
Well, uh, listen, you should try
and get some sleep, huh ?
- Yeah, that's a good idea. All right.
- Okay. Seeyou tomorrow.
- All right.
There's some good hallways that way.
- Uh-huh.
- How's this one ?
- Not bad.
- Good. Good.
- Seeyou tomorrow.
Okay.
Coming, Mother.
-
- I'm coming.
-
-
Nell! Nell!
Nell ! Nell !
- What is it ?
- I don't know.
- Where's it coming from ?
- It's everywhere.
-
-
-
-
Oh, my God.
What's happening ?
- Canyoufeelit, Nell ?
- Mm-hmm.
The cold, can you feel it ?
Nell, can you feel it ?
Oh.
-
- Nell ?
It's moving.
It's over.
It's over, right ?
Nell, comebackhere.
- Come back here !
- No, it's in my room.
It's in my room.
-
-
Youguysallright ?
- Hey, is everythingokay ?
- Oh, God.
It's Luke.
-Hey, is everythingokay ?
-
- Youguysallright ?
- Luke ! Oh, God.
- What's going on ?
- Did you hear it ?
- Yeah, I just heard it. I--
- W-W-Was it part ofthe experiment ?
- Was what part ofthe experiment ?
- The noise !
- What did you hear ?
- Theo, all I heard was you screaming,
'' Luke, help me, please.''
I wasn't screaming foryou.
- It was in my room,
and then it went into Nell's room.
- Here, let me look.
- Are there any lights ?
- Yes.
I don't-- I don't see anything.
I don't hear anything.
Wow, I sort ofgot screwed
on the old bedroom selection.
Every room's, like,
four times as big as mine.
-
- Is that it ? Is that whatyou heard ?
Well, I didjust take a bath.
I mean, could've been.
Yeah, but then how doyou explain
the breath and the cold ?
I don't know. A draft. Maybe someone
left a window open somewhere.
The cold,
who felt it first ?
- Oh, I think it was me.
- What difference does it make ?
Well, Eleanor, ifit was you,
did you sayTheo ?
- Theo, ifit wasyou, didyou--
- Look, I don't need anyone
to tell me I'm cold.
Let'sblameiton the oldplumbing
then, huh ? Whatelse coulditbe ?
Well, ifyou don't need me anymore,
I guess that's it.
- Myjob is done. Good night.
- Good night, Luke.
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.
- Will you two be all right ?
- Yeah.
You really
didn't hear anything ?
No.
-
-
Eleanor.
Eleanor.
Find us, Eleanor.
Oh, Eleanor.
Find us.
Okay.
These carvings
are really creepy.
All these fat little cherubs
and angels with furry animals.
It's really bizarre,
I think.
I think they're the children
Hugh Crain built the house for.
I don't buy that for a second--
that Hugh Crain
was this lovable old tycoon...
withasoftspot
forkids.
Theguy was obviously
runningasweatshop.
Had children working
and then he builds
all this crap as propaganda.
It's like those Teletubbies.
Those things freak me out also.
And they sing, so they're actually even
kind ofscarier, ifyou think about it.
Yeah.
-  How areyou comin' along ?
- I can't get this one.
- What aboutyou ?
- I did all right.
But that's another thing.
These tests.
It's like, why do we have to be here ?
Why do we have to be
in this weird old house ?
I like this house.
I think it's a beautiful house.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know. I just think
Dr. Marrow's up to something.
I'll tell you another thing.
I'm gonna get
to the bottom ofit,
right after I check on Theo,
that is.
See how
my old pal Theo's doing.
- Doing orwearing ?
- Yeah, no kidding.
Did you see
what she had on yesterday ?
Wow. Yeah, Idefinitelygot
asoftspotfor Theo.
Nell, I'm gonna shut this door
and giveyou a little privacy.
- Ifthere'sanyonein there,
we'll findhim.
- Youjust saw something move ?
- I saw something in the fireplace.
- Okay. Just relax.
I did.
I know I did.
You were here alone ?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, Luke hadjust left.
- I didn't see anything, though.
Luke, can you help me ?
-Just ashes.
- Charred wood.
- Watch out. Letitgo.
- Yep.
Hello ? Santa ?
- Whoa !
-Jesus ! God !
- God, areyou all right ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
-  Whatis that ?
- A flue.
-A what ?
-It's-- It'san oldflue!
Itopens up the chimney.
God !
Is this whatyou saw ?
No. No,
that's not what I saw.
Mm-mmm,
thatisnot whatIsaw.
God. Hey, areyou okay ?
- Luke, areyou okay ?
- What ?
No, I'm not okay ! Did you not see
that thing ? It almost crushed me !
Yeah, I saw it.
Jeez, I was only asking !
That's what it was.
Ofcourseyou were scared.
- Itscaredthehelloutofme too.
- No, I know what I saw.
Eleanor,
this is a very confusing house.
You said ityourself.
Nothing is what it seems.
Look at me.
I'm not confused.
I saw something, and that wasn't it.
There was something in there.
Hey, you guys
should take a look at this.
''Welcomehome, Eleanor''?
-Oh, God.
- Whatdoes thatmean ?
His face.
It's my name.
Who did this ?
Who wrote this ?
Is this one of
your sickjokes, Luke ?
What ? Come on.
Give me a little credit.
I think I have a better
sense ofhumor than that.
Doyou really think I wrote that ?
Youfoundit. Youcouldhave.
Oh, with what ? With the 20-foot ladder
that I keep in my back pocket ?
M-Maybeyou wrote it, Theo !
You're the artist !
- Maybe this isyourgreatidea ofart!
- Don'tberidiculous.
I wanna know right now ! Who wrote
this ? Did you write this, Theo ?
No ! Ofcourse not !
Maybe it was you !
Howdareyouaccuseme ofwriting this !
Maybeyoulike
being the centerofattention!
- Whatareyou talkingabout ?
- Let's stop this now. Come on.
Who wasit ?
Whoeverwrote this,
it's cruel.
Youdon'tknowme.
I didn't do it.
Eleanor.
Areyou all right ?
I knowyou think I did it,
but I didn't.
- Look, people are always--
- No, I'm not making this stuffup.
I mean, I knowyou all think I'm crazy
or doing this for attention. I'm not.
Forwhat it's worth,
I believeyou're a very sensitive woman,
and I believe that people have
taken advantage ofyou in the past.
Mmm. ''Welcome home.''
You'll never see it again.
Mr. Dudley's taking care ofit.
Come on. There'ssomething
I wantyou tosee.
- Oh, this is beautiful !
-  Thoughtyou'd like it.
-
- Well, I wonder whathappenedtohim.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, violets.
Somebodymust've diedhere.
- Well.
-
You know, all my life
I've been waiting for an adventure,
and I thought
it would never happen to me.
Adventures are for soldiers...
or for the women the bullfighters
fall in love with.
Andhere Iam.
Paintingsare callingout tome,
strange noises in the night,
and all it cost was five gallons ofgas.
Doyou really think that someone's
playing with you, Eleanor ?
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
I can be a victim,
or I can be a volunteer.
I'm gonna be a volunteer.
Mm-hmm.
Eleanor. Eleanor!
Eleanor, findus.
- Eleanor.
- Hmm ?
Eleanor, the ledger.
The ledger.
What ?
It's Crain's study.
''Concord.''
Oh, his textile mills.
''Man. Woman. Child. ''
Child.
''Twelveyears. ''
'' Eleven years.
Twelveyears.''
There's so many ofthem.
''Tenyears.
Twelveyears.''
They died soyoung.
'' Eleven years.''
What happened toyou ?
- Theo!
- Okay, okay.
- Theo !
- Yeah, what ?
- There's hundreds ofthem.
-
- He kept records ofeveryone.
- I was havin' the best
night's sleep ofmy life.
I swear.
The names, the dates
and the ages.
The names--
they're crossed out.
-It's dead children, Theo.
-Can we talk about this in the morning ?
- They showed me. They--
-
Oh, you're never gonna
believe how I found them.
How'd you find them ?
The blood led me
to the bookcase.
The blood ?
Little footprints
in blood.
Nell, I'm worried
aboutyou.
Theo, the house,
it's trying to tell me something.
No. You know what ?
Nell, youjust gotta
get some sleep, okay ?
You've gotta sleep.
Come on. Go to bed.
Okay.
I'm listening.

Dr. Marrow?
Dr. Marrow ?
Dr. Marrow ?
Dr. Marrow ?
EleanorVance continues...
her alienation
ofthe other subjects.
It remains unclear
what she saw in the fireplace...
and whether she truly believes
she did not deface the painting.
Interview with Vance
in greenhouseyesterday...
toascertain the extent
ofherself-delusion...
was inconclusive,
due tosubject's...
emotionalinstability.
Well, I think
Iknowhowexperiments work.
Wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on, Theo.
What about all the noises,
and the fireplace and the painting ?
- I think it's an old academic
''bait and switch,'' where--
- What ?
whereyou pretend that
it's a study on insomnia,
but what he's really interested in
is seeing our reaction...
- to these phenomenons
he's obviously behind.
- No.
It's not Dr. Marrow.
Oh, Nell, I've been--
Areyou all right ?
God, I've been looking
foryou everywhere.
- Areyou okay ?
- Mm-hmm.
It's not Dr. Marrow.
Then who ? Come on, Nell.
Ifit's not Dr. Marrow--
Ifyou don't think this is really
somehow part ofthe experiment,
then why wouldyou
stayhereanothersecond?
'Cause home is where
the heart is.
Oh, myGod!
- Whatisit ?
- Oh, no.
What ?
What, Nell ?
Nell !
Ifit's not Dr. Marrow,
that's a pretty scary proposition.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
I'm not making this up !
No, I'm not.
I'm not, I know I'm--
There is something--
There's something in here.
I can prove it.
I can prove-- I know I can.
Oh, I know it is.
Carolyn.
Carolyn was his second wife.
Eleanor, the fireplace.
Where ?
Where areyou ?
Whereareyou ?
I'm here. Ihearyou.
-
- Where ? That's whereyouare.
Okay, I'll letyou out.
I'll getyou out.
I-I will.
Okay.
I'mgonnagetyouout.
I will. I'llgetyouout.
Don't worry.
What's thatsmell ?
-
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
He killed them.
- What ?
- Hekilledthem.
The children from the mills.
It'sjust likeyou said.
He wanted to fill the house
with the sounds ofchildren.
He took them from his mills
and he brought them here,
but he wouldn't let them go.
He wouldneverlet themgo.
And I found the skulls,
just like Carolyn did.
- Carolyn ? Who's Carolyn ?
- Killed who, Eleanor ?
- Calm down, now.
-Andhehadasecondwife.
But he couldn't hide
his secret.
You can never hide
a secret.
Carolyn found out
what he'd done.
And now he wants me.
Who ? Who wants you ?
And why ?
- She's delusional.
- But what is happening to her ?
She's in a fugue state.
Let's get her to the sofa.
- Wanted to... fill the house
with children, but...
- Get a blanket.
- Come on.
- he-he turned into a monster.
- It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.
- No.
Carolyn showed me in the photograph
where she hid 'em.
And they're all
locked together in there.
- He won't let them go.
- Eleanor, listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
It's not true.
He's still here.
Hugh Crain
is still in the house.
- No.
- Yeah.
I mean, what ifshe's right ?
What ifshe's right ?
What areyou sayin', Theo ?
It doesn't do any good to talk about--
- Stop. Stop ! Stop !
- Whatifshe's right ?
Now, listen to me,
all ofyou.
Let me explain
what's happening.
You're participating in a study
on group fear and hysteria.
What ?
That's whyyoubroughtushere ?
That's what this isallabout ?
You brought us here to scare us ?
Is that it ?
Yes.
You'rejust waiting for her to
have a total nervous breakdown
beforeyou said anything ?
- No !
- What is your problem ?
I gaveyou the clues. You created
the story as you were meant to.
- But it's over. I'm pulling the plug.
- Oh, that--
- None ofthis is real.
- No, it is real.
- Eleanor, it's not real.
- No !
- You have to look at
the bones in the fireplace !
- It's not real !
And then I saw-- I saw his wife,
hanging in the greenhouse !
- I know I saw it !
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I broughtyou here, all ofyou.
The Dudleys will be here in the morning,
and then we can all go home at once.
- No ! I can't believe
you're not gonna look.
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'm taking her upstairs.
I thinkyou've done enough.
- I'll helpyou.
Becauseit wasa controlledexperiment.
A controlled experiment ?
She's in total shock !
You can't do that !
- I told you,
it wasn't meant to be like this.
- Oh, come on.
You don't care about us.
You don't care about insomnia.
Youjust wanted to scare the hell out of
us so we'd fit intoyour little test...
- or model orwhatever bullshit
you need to understand this !
- Oh, please ! Okay !
- You can't do it !
- Now, listen ! You listen.
I am trying to help people. My field
ofstudy is the science offear.
I try to understand why people
act the way they act, why
they feel the way they feel--
You don't feel.
Where areyou going ?
I'm gonna find out
what Eleanorwas talking about.
What am I doing ?
Good night.
Berightback.
I'llgetyousome tea.
Oh, God, it's looking for me.
Who was holding my hand ?
-
- No.
-
-  No !
No !
I will not letyou
hurt a child !
Luke !
David !
Dr. Marrow !

Eleanor!

Who areyou ?
Oh, no !
Why doyou want me ?
Who am I ?
Who am I ?
Why doyou want me ?
Why ?
Oh, God !
Who am I ?
What areyou trying to tell me ?
Welcome home, Eleanor.
Oh, no ! No !
It's not true.
No !
-Eleanor?
- What ?
Eleanor, don't be afraid.
You can understand me ?
The doors, Eleanor.
Only the doors can hold him.
-
-
Oh, no!
He's coming !
What ?
What's wrong ?
What doyou want from me ?
Help us, Eleanor.
Help us.
What ? Whatareyou

Eleanor.

Don't move.
Don't move.
Oh, Nell.
Just stay there.
- Hold on, Eleanor.
-  Watch out! The cable !
Look out!
It's not gonna hold yourweight there !
It's breaking apart !
Don'tmove, now. Don'tmove.
Oh, my God.
-
-
No !
-
- Oh, shit.
Eleanor, lookatme.
I need you to climb over
and step back on the platform.
Come on. I wantyou

Climb overandstep on theplatform.

- Come on. Come on. We have to go.
- No, he won't--
- I won't leaveyou. I won't leaveyou.
- Okay.
She doesn'tlookgood.
Hey, I think I'm gonna take her
to see a doctor, right now.
I think I'm gonna take her
to see a real doctor.
We'll take her to the hospital
in the morning. The gate's still locked.
We have to wait
until the Dudleys arrive.
What ? That's
real compassionate.
Yeah, let's wait
until the morning,
and then maybe tonightyou'll have
a chance to scribble a few more...
- ''Welcomehome, Eleanor''s on the wall.
- I didn't write that, okay ?
You'd neverwrite that.
That wouldn't be ethical, would it ?
Will you guysjust shut up ?
Come on !
Somebody's gonna have to staywith
her tonight. We can't leave her alone.
All right,
I'll take the first watch.
Okay.
The, uh, environmentis
provingentirelysuccessful...
in promoting
shared hysteria reactions.
The group is manifesting--
manifesting classic
pathologies oftrauma and--
I should have stopped this
when Mary got hurt,
and definitely
when Eleanorwas--
Jesus, I need to
get them out ofhere.
What happened ?

It's not real.

You told me

That sounds

Theo is saying anything she can.
You know I don't have an apartment.

You're gonna love it there, I promise.
Come on, Nell. Please ?
No.
I'm right where
I'm wanted.
-
- I'm home.
- I'm home.
- Dr. Marrow, please,

You see,
this is the room...
where Carolyn had her baby
before she ran away.
And the children, theywanted me to see
this so I would know this was my home.
Oh, my God.
Yes. See, Carolyn was
my great-great grandmother,
and the children
are my family.
This is where I belong.
I have to stay.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I have to stay for the children.
They need me.
No.
Nell, the children are dead.
No. Not for him.
He's still haunting them.
But ifI'm here,
-he can'tharm them.
-
Nell, please ! We have to go !
Just grab her !
- You have to go now. You can't stay.
