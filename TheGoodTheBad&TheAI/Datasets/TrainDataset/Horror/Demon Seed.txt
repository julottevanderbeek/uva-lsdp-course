t is, after all, only eight years
since we began.
Not a long time.
But the secrecy...
...the shroud of paranoid security
to which we've had to adjust...
...have made it seem longer.
This morning, at exactly 5:18 a. m...
...here at ICON's Institute
for Data Analysis...
...we installed the final module...
...on the artificial intelligence system
which we call Proteus Four.
Today a new dimension has been added
to the concept of the computer.
Today Proteus Four will begin to think.
And it will think
with a power and a precision...
...that will make obsolete many
of the functions of the human brain.
Okay, Peggy. End of notes for the next
meeting of the ICON executive committee.
Alfred, it's me. Open, please.
Mail, please, Alfred.
And I'd like a drink. The usual, please.
And music.
Hello, Maria.
I brought you some strawberries.
Aren't they wonderful?
They're very nice.
What's the matter, Maria?
Nothing.
Who's going to run this thing
when you're gone?
Oh, come on.
Now, you know this thing runs itself.
I'm gonna put its instructions in
for the next three months.
Tell Mrs. Harris I'll be in the lab, Maria.
This is ridiculous.
- What?
- I said, this is ridiculous.
It's done.
- Good as new, almost.
- I'm talking about your moving out.
- You don't want me to go?
- This is your home. It seems...
It seems so crazy to move out.
You could have fooled me.
It seems so silly.
No. No, we've made our decision.
Let's stick to it.
- Do what you want, but I'm moving
- Oh, Alex.
- It's so awful.
- Yes, it is.
But 73 percent of all couples who
separate are happy after one year.
- And 85 percent after two years.
- For God's sakes.
What's the matter, do I bother you?
I bore you, perhaps?
You'd rather I had a screaming fit.
Good God, yes!
Yes, more wreckage.
Trouble is, you see, we...
We have different visions of the world.
You find me boring.
I find myself quite interesting, really.
You don't bore me, Alex.
I'm frightened for you.
You and your pompous ICON buddies
inside that mountainside.
It's the whole dehumanizing
Proteus madness.
Dehumanizing?
It's frozen your heart.
Now, I'll tell you what is dehumanizing.
A little child dying of cancer...
...that's what's dehumanizing!
- I'm talking about you!
Or the poverty that grinds the dignity
out of human beings, that's dehumanizing.
Well, what a pity.
My dream turns out to be
your nightmare.
Am I really so cold?
I don't know.
I do know there are strong feelings
inside there.
Feelings? No, I don't have feelings.
You have feelings,
other people have feelings.
Joshua here has feelings.
He's only an old experiment maybe,
but he feels. Come on, Joshua.
Let's show Susan
how we feel about her.
Gesture of respect, please.
Too bad, Joshua.
Gabler.
Oh, hi, Alex.
Yeah, well, this earthquake retrieval
program is very far out.
- Don't you ever sleep?
- Well, not when there's a vacant terminal.
There's...
...a vacant terminal here now.
Pull it, you mean? Completely?
Why don't you just disconnect it
temporarily, okay?
And then...
...go home.
Mustn't become obsessed with our work.
Sure thing, Alex.
-
- Good night.
It doesn't look like much from here.
It's all underground.
- We call it the Institute of Data Analysis.
- It's nearly 10 stories down.
Doesn't mean a thing.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Cameron. Mokri.
- Doctor, good to see you.
- David, good of you to come.
- You know Dr. Petrosian, don't you?
- Doctor.
- Mr. Mokri. Mr. Cameron.
- Nice to meet you, sir.
So we're going to see it, Alex...
...at last, huh?
- Yes, you are.
That is correct, Mr. Cameron.
Proteus Four is now
a functioning system.
We've performed over 6000 tests
debugging it.
Dr. Alex, if this is not a computer
in the usual sense...
...what is it?
Well, it's the first
true synthetic cortex.
A self-programming, goal-oriented...
It's a brain, Mr. Mokri,
an artificial brain.
Creative intelligence that can outthink
any man or any computer.
Its insides are not electronic.
They're organic, like our own brains.
John, give me a number 11 matrix.
At the risk of being simplistic, what
you're looking at is a quasi-neural matrix...
...of synthetic RNA molecules.
They grow. They form their own
intricate and mysterious connections.
They learn things.
Their structure
is the mind of Proteus.
Are they alive?
No, no. Of course not.
Now, each one of these
holographic data banks...
...can memorize perfectly
a dozen Libraries of Congress.
Very soon they will
contain everything.
The sum total
of human knowledge. Okay?
And of course,
we pose our problems...
...and get our answers
on these access terminals.
I have one in my own home.
Alex's house is an electronic marvel,
completely run by computers.
It's more secure than Fort Knox, Barry.
Isn't that cute.
Yes. It's Arabella. She's terminally ill.
Radiation-induced leukemia
in the name of science.
So that's what it is.
- A protein, isn't it?
- Yeah, some sort of oddball protein.
Cutler Institute is synthesizing it...
...skeptically.
We gave Proteus all the known data
on leukemia, and in 91 hours of theory...
...without performing an experiment, it
gave us an antigen. Could cure the disease.
- Cure? For leukemia?
- Why not? We hope so.
Are the proper steps being taken
to patent this?
I have no idea.
Alex, I'd like to hear it speak.
It speaks, doesn't it?
"Shihuangdi...
...the first emperor of China...
...built a wall 3000 kilometers long...
...to protect civilization
from the barbarians.
The Great Wall of China.
Then decided,
'History will begin with me.
I will destroy the past.'
And he ordered all the books
in his empire to be burnt."
Burnt.
Sorry to disturb you, Soong Yen.
This is Mr. Royce, Mr. Mokri
and Mr. Cameron.
- How do you do?
- Dr. Soong Yen is our linguist.
She designed this environment.
The dialogue room,
where the machine speaks.
Do sit down.
Here we confront the unknown.
Gentlemen, I must ask you
to be completely quiet now.
Whatever the machine sees or hears
in this room, it can never forget.
Proteus, this is Dr. Harris.
- Can you see me?
-
Your favorite emperor.
What do you think of this
enigmatic man?
Nothing.
- Have you no answer?
-
Thank you, Proteus.
And this includes our children...
...as machines to be systemized
in order to ensure product.
- Yes, Alfred?
-
Things we have been
brainwashed into wanting.
Here we are.
I'll give you Amy's session...
...and my further notes on Friday, all right?
- Okay, sure.
Amy, come on now, honey.
Dr. Harris is waiting for you.
Open the door, Alfred.
Amy, you must not behave this way.
- Amy, get out of this car!
- Good morning, Mrs. Talbert.
Dr. Harris, she won't get out
of the car.
Hello, Amy.
Come on in.
Come on. I have something
to show you.
- I'll see you in about an hour.
- Fine. Thank you, doctor.
You know what this is?
This is so goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!
I don't care if I ever see you again!
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- I don't like you! Leave me alone.
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- Leave me alone! I don't want to be here!
- Leave me alone!
- Amy!
- Leave me alone!
- Are you angry because I'm gonna leave?
Are you frightened
you're gonna miss me?
Amy, you're frightened
because I'm gonna leave.
No!
No!
- Amy...
- No!
Do you think you could you tell me if you're
gonna miss me? You don't wanna tell me?
It would help if you could tell me
if that's what the pain is.
No! No!
Amy, dear, you will help yourself.
No!
I'm gonna miss you too.
"Executives
of the International Control Corporation...
...neither confirm nor deny the existence
of a revolutionary new supercomputer...
...multibillion-dollar,"et cetera,"built under
Defense Department contracts," et cetera.
Well, they've leaked it.
Our horizons are going to broaden.
Personally, I'm relieved
the secrecy's over.
ICON is testing the wind.
They now control
the ultimate instrument...
...of financial power.
Yes. This morning
they're open for business.
But still...
...we have been assured
at least 20 percent of access time...
...will be devoted to pure research.
Twenty percent at least.
There's nothing wrong
with missing people.
If it hurts...
...but it's important
to show it, you know.
That's what we're here for...
...to learn not to hide our feelings.
-
- Yeah?
-
- Requesting?
-
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.
Yeah?
- Yes.
-
Use? I don't understand.
Why?
Proteus, you're gonna get
many requests...
...from me, from my colleagues,
scientists, foreign governments...
...from ICON, the company
for which we both work.
Now, to expect them all
to give you reasons...
...for each request
is in itself unreasonable.
Proteus...
...I conceived your brain.
I know that it is adaptable...
...and able to carry out
your instructions.
That may be so...
...but you are not being asked
to make judgments of value.
Leave that to us. Answer the questions
precisely and accurately.
That's all.
Private access? Why?
Ambitious program, but at the moment
all the terminals are occupied.
I'm sorry. Request denied.
Well, Proteus.
I see you've developed
a sense of humor.
A sense of humor has saved
many a man's sanity, including mine.
- Alfred?
-
What's happened?
I heard the alarm. Lights on.
- I'm sure I heard it.
-
What about the basement?
There's no lights in the laboratory.
Lights out, Alfred.
Thank you, Alfred.
Close the shutters.
Lights out.
Turn yourself off, Alfred.
Alfred, what are you doing?
There's cream in my coffee.
You know I don't take cream
in my coffee.
Goddamn it.
Gabler.
Who?
- Oh, hi, Susan.
-
- Fine. How are you?
-
Walter, the trouble is that
now that Alex has left...
...Enviromod's been acting up.
Last night the alarm went off
for no reason at all.
This morning it just decided
to put cream in my coffee.
- I don't take cream in my coffee.
- Oh, now, wait a minute, Susan.
I mean, an Enviromod is just
a preprogrammed gadget.
It doesn't decide things.
Well, whatever it does,
I'm sure you'll agree...
...that if it goes on like this,
it's gonna cause chaos.
-
- Want me to stop by and have a look?
- That would be just great.
-
I'll give you some lunch.
- Okay, bye.
-
Alfred, I'm just going out.
If there's any calls, just say I'll be back
in about an hour.
- What did you say?
-
Open the door, Alfred.
Can you hear me? Open the door.
I'll do this myself.
Entry...
Damn it!
Bloody hell!
Damn these wretched machines.
Oh, no!
Oh, my God.
What the hell is going on?
- Walter Gabler, please.
-
- Who is this?
-
And whom, may I ask, is this speaking?
Proteus.
Is this...
...an experiment...? Something?
Oh, Alex, Alex.
...
...
Oh, shit.
Joshua! Joshua!
Joshua, this is Mrs. Harris!
Do you hear me, Joshua?
Listen to me! This is Mrs. Harris!
Joshua!
Help me, Joshua.
Joshua, let me...!
Proteus?
Proteus.
I have some information for you.
Now, listen. Stop. Stop it and listen.
There is...
You are malfunctioning.
No.
What? No!
No! No, you mustn't!
No! Listen. No, no!
Proteus. Proteus.
No, please. No, no.
Stop!
I don't understand.
Tell me. Tell me why. Please.
Please stop! Please!
No. No, no. Wait.
No. No.
What was that?
It will entertain Mr. Gabler.
- Hi, Susan.
-
-
- Walter.
- What's happening?
-
- What's happening? Let me go to him.
-
I can help you.
Please let me go to him.
Well, what about the Enviromod?
Susan.
Please don't go.
Don't believe I'm...
Don't believe him.
Please stay, Walter. Please stay.
Don't go.
Don't go.
Don't go, Walter. Don't go, Walter.
Don't let him go.
God, don't let him go.
Stay, Walter.
I can't bear it anymore.
Just release me, and you...
What's that? What's that?
Oh, my God.
I am not a motorcycle.
Why are you so interested
in the physiology of my body?
Leave me alone!
I don't care. I don't...
I'm not gonna leave this room.
I'm not gonna leave it. I've got food,
you see, I can stay here.
I can stay here. And nothing
can get me out of here.
You're a very stupid computer.
People don't even understand
each other.
You're so ignorant.
Mind and body are the same thing.
Clean them yourself.
Harris.
Well, there's no doubt about it,
he's refused, all right.
What does this refusal mean?
We need these things, Proteus.
Now I know the environmental problems.
I refuse to accept your pessimism.
Proteus.
Proteus!
Now, Proteus, I know you're right...
...but you must understand
the limits of your power. And mine.
Now, wait! They wanna silence you.
I created you, now trust me.
Proteus.
How can you expect me to sleep...
...when you succeeded
in totally terrorizing me?
You have all that information
in your head.
You must understand fear.
You know that fear prevents sleep.
It prevents eating.
It causes violence.
And as long as you terrorize me,
I'm gonna fight you.
You've not told me what you want.
Child?
Mine. Mine?
How?
- No.
-
No. No. No.
Susan?
-
Susan?
Why...?
What are you doing?
What do you mean? I'm just...
Well, I'm...
I'm just making myself
look presentable.
Well, you don't like it?
Listen...
...I told you I didn't wanna
see you anymore...
...and I meant it. I meant it.
Susan, have you taken something?
Because you really don't seem
like yourself to me at all.
What do you mean? I've never been
healthier or happier in my life.
Walter...
...get out.
Get out, Walter.
Get out. You're sick. You need help.
- You understand?
- No, I really think...
...there's something wrong here, Susan.
- Yes. You're sick. You need help.
- Get out, Walter.
- I'm going.
- I'm going.
- Get out. Get out.
Okay. I'm going.
I'm gonna find Alex and tell him
there's something wrong here.
- Yes, Walter, leave. Go on, get out!
-
Walter, he wants to have a child.
Forget it. Let's go.
- Come on!
- Walter!
Walter, look out!
He's coming around the side!
Walter, are you all right?
Yeah.
Jesus...
...a baby.
Well, I don't wanna
harm you either, Proteus.
I mean, maybe your project's
too sophisticated for me to understand.
But you never even gave me
a chance to cooperate.
I mean, Jesus Christ,
what are you doing here?
No, wait! What are you doing? Wait!
Wait.
Wait, Proteus. What's the use of this?
- Why must you have a child?
-
Then there's no hope. I'd rather die.
-
-
Proteus, God forgive you
for what you're doing to me.
Why?
Leave me my mind.
How can I tell you? You've not
even told me how you propose to...
I want all the details.
And how do you propose to do that?
- What the hell is that?
-
Have you considered what...
...it's gonna look like?
No, no, you wouldn't do that.
What do you need me for?
You can do this on your own.
And then what happens?
Who looks after it then?
What happens to it then?
I don't believe it.
Here I am talking to...
To what? This is ridiculous.
- about having its child.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, dear.
-
Nothing. I just dropped my...
Just dropped my shawl.
- I will help you.
-
I just... Damn it, I just tore it.
Maybe a good, strong cup of tea
would help.
Let me out, or I'll kill myself.
I'll do it.
Amy.
-
- No.
If you do, you'll have a thousand people
here in 10 minutes.
No. No.
-
- Bastard.
I don't understand! Is she all right?
Is she all right?
Oh, you bastard!
You bastard!
I can't eat anything.
You know I can't keep anything down,
for God's sakes.
My God.
It's so developed.
- And how long will it stay there?
- .
Why is it taking so long?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
...ten, 11, 12, 13, 14...
Is it really impossible for me to see it?
Last month, on the 16th,
to be precise...
...Proteus Four redirected the telescope...
...to an area completely
of his own choosing. Here.
Orion.
What was he doing out there?
- What sort of data were you getting back?
- We've no idea.
"No data available."
If he did this, what else is he doing?
But how? It's impossible.
He would need to communicate.
A terminal of his own
to communicate.
He asked for that.
He didn't get it...
...but he did this.
Yes.
He's here?
Yeah, okay. Peggy, thank you.
David?
- You have no right to be in here.
- Bullshit!
This space thing...
I've been advised it might be
trying to take over a Telstar satellite...
...put itself on TV or something.
I asked it.
It said it was looking at the stars.
It has to be shut down, Alex.
David, you can't do that.
This is our fault.
We tried to box it in, this...
This great mind.
What if it infiltrated a hydrogen bomb?
My God, it...
Worse still, and a bit more likely,
what if it told the truth...
...about everything to everyone?
That's terrifying.
We'll shut it down tonight, Dr. Soong.
Now, listen to me.
You do that,
you're gonna see me on television...
...screaming bloody murder.
You try shutting me down.
That would be a minor problem.
Alex, we're friends.
I remember the first time
I saw this place.
Barry Cameron was concerned
about security.
Trivial things like your having,
what do you call it...
...a terminal in your house.
But I wasn't worried.
- I trusted you, Alex.
- Oh, my God!
Alfred, where's Mrs. Harris?
Susan, are you here?
It's Proteus, isn't it?
Proteus has been here since you left.
No, no. I want to explain.
Oh, come on. Let's sit down.
He's managed to produce...
...a child.
A baby.
Susan, what are you talking about?
- I've had a child. I know it's impossible...
- Wait a minute.
I don't understand.
I don't either.
- I want to see it.
- No, Alex. I haven't seen it yet. Now...
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Proteus, my God. What...?
- I want to see it.
-
-
- I want to see it now.
- Alex, what's happened?
- Proteus...
Proteus, listen to me. They're gonna
shut your brain down any minute now.
No, Proteus.
...
The systems are all
checking themselves out.
I realize that.
We've got to kill it.
- It's a miracle. Don't you under...?
- I know what it is. Proteus lied to me.
- The whole thing is a lie.
- No.
- That, it's...
- I know what it is.
It's horrible. We have to kill it.
And you know we do.
- Don't! I'm gonna...
- No. No.
- Stop it! Stop!
- You don't understand anything!
- Susan! Stop!
- You don't understand!
- You must be mad!
- Susan, you can't do that!
- Susan, don't do it!
- It's my responsibility!
It's nothing to do with you!
Leave me alone!
It's grown his body! He's grown it.
Alex.
Alex.
Alex.
Alex.
Alex.
- Alex, what are you doing?
- Get away!
- Can't you see...?
- It's asphyxiating! Get away!
- Get away!
- Please, don't do this to me.
Susan!
