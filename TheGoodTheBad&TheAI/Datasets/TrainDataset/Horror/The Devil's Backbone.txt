What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
An instant of pain, perhaps.
Something dead which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
THE DEVlL'S BACKBONE
We'll be there soon.
What the...?
lt fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.
They came...
...they defused it...
...and they left it there. Nobody can move it.
Follow me, please.
Carlos...
Wait for me here. We won't be long.
Who are those people outside?
The caretaker and two men who help him.
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.
They're building a ohicken coop.
What's going on out there?
-They've arrived.
-Ayala and Dominguez again?
Yes. Ayala's wounded.
They're always in trouble.
They've brought another boy.
As if we didn't have enough already.
Let's go.
Are you a new kid?
Got any candy? Or a bit of bread?
I'm Galvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he looks a lot.
I'm Carlos.
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?
No, but l've got some comics and toys.
-Want to see them?
-Yeah.
l can't do it.
l can't accept another boy.
l can barely feed the ones who are here.
l'm sorry.
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.
The boy doesn't know.
He doesn't know.
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.
Oh, no!
l'm the brave one.
Ricardo was a man of books of ideas.
He decided to die and leave me
here to defend his ideals.
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?
Reds looking after the children of Reds.
Not to mention this!
l can't keep it anymore.
lf you want to leave the boy,...
...take the rest of the gold.
There are 10 ingots left.
At least you can buy guns.
l can't even buy bread with it.
Take it away.
We can't.
-We're crossing enemy lines.
-You decide.
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.
Class time!
Come on!
Look, Owl, a comic book!
I'll swap you.
Look at this marble. It's my favorite.
It's from China.
Or look at this one.
Owl made it himself.
All made from snot and mud.
lt's six months of snot.
Hey, you! That's mine!
-Are you here to stay?
-No.
Then why are you here?
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.
What's a tutor?
He looks after me while my father's away.
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.
Take the comic from me. Go on.
Take it away. C'mon.
Carlos, look!
Mr. Ayala.
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!
Stay with him for a while.
He seems well behaved.
I'm sure you'll get along.
We'll have to fix it.
''The Count of Monte-Cristo.''
Has Edmond Dantes broken out of prison yet?
-Has he met Abbot Faria?
-They're digging a tunnel.
-Do they manage to escape?
-I don't know.
Why don't you read on and tell me?
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.
She teaches maths and reading.
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?
Her name is Carmen.
-ls she your girlfriend?
-She's the principal.
Why did they leave me here?
Why can't I be with my father?
Carlitos...
...you're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.
So be patient.
Your soap has to last you all year.
Be careful with it...
...or you'll be punished with
two weeks of extra tasks.
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.
This is your bed.
Number 12.
Why are there so many empty beds?
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.
lt's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...
For your locker.
Do you understand?
There are no bars here. This isn't a prison.
See where they put the new kid?
-ln Santi's bed.
-Shut up!
Pig and I think that even though
you complain a lot...
...you're all right here.
Far away from the war, well hidden.
Well looked after.
-What could be better?
-Granada.
Why go to Granada?
We're getting married.
We want to buy a farm there.
Sure.
Granada!
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?
I don't need anyone.
I've managed fine on my own up to now.
Right.
And without parents.
Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.
-Yeah, the school's gold.
-That's why they eat so well here.
You don't believe me now...
...but you will.
I'll try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?
-No.
-All right, so long.
I don't like those two.
...I'd stand here...
...in the middle of the yard...
...and I'd look up at the sky.
I dreamed of getting out of here.
I prayed to become rich...
...so I could buy this dump and tear it down.
You're so complicated.
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.
Well, l'm glad you came back.
Let's go to my room, it's getting oold.
San... ti...
Who are you?
What are you doing?
-Me? Nothing.
-What the hell's going on?
The fucking new kid spilled our water.
Come on.
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.
lsn't that off limits?
No one's ever been caught.
What about the ''one who sighs''?
What's it to be? Are you going or not?
Who's the ''one who sighs''?
You're chickenshit.
No, l'm not.
You're a shit, a queer.
All right, l'll go.
But you're coming with me.
We'll each fill a jug.
But if you're scared...
They say it's switched off.
But l don't believe it.
Put your ear against it, you'll hear ticking.
That's its heart. lt's still alive.
And it knows we're here.
Hide!
That one.
C'mon.
See you outside.
''No one's ever been caught.'' Bastard.
Shit!
Hello.
Who are you?
Do you live down here?
Many of you will die.
Jaime!
What are you up to?
''Out, out,...
...yearnings of mine. Let not respect bind you.
lt flatters pity...
lt flatters pity not to be able to hide.
Let your lips bear witness...
...to the blaze in your heart.
No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.
He who cares for his wellbeing
keeps not his feelings silent.
My grief is greater than l
And that being so...
...it will be easier...
...it will be easier....
...for it to defeat me...
...than for l to command it.
Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.
He is not a brave prisoner.
Who dares not break down his gaol.''
A grain of strength.
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?
He's not going to tell.
He'll squeal in the end, just wait and see.
You understand?
Then, for the last time...
Who was with you last night?
l was alone.
That boy won't talk.
lf we want to know who was with him...
-What's for breakfast?
-Milk and bread.
Perfect.
Very well.
You may begin.
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.
They're ravenous, look at how they're eating.
The first one to look up from his plate
is his accomplice.
Marcos,... ...Galvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here.
l knew you wouldn't squeal.
Dr. Casares tricked me.
That's what l said.
lt isn't your fault, we were punished.
Dr. Casares is real smart.
He sure is!
Careful.
Come on, Owl.
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!
Well, well!
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.
Are things that bad?
lf the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...
Try it now.
l told you.
Dance with me.
-No.
-Come on.
-No.
-Come on, dance with me.
l can't dance.
Ayala said so.
Catalonia is about to fall.
Then Madrid will fall, and then...
-There,s talk of a ghost. Have you heard?
-Yes.
Sometimes l think that we are the ghosts.
Galvez... Last night, you didn't shoot.
That's right.
Wow, that's great!
lt's for you.
Why are they laughing?
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.
England or France might still intervene.
That's just wishful thinking.
-You're like Ricardo.
-No.
No, l'm not like him.
And l stayed. That's all.
Look at it jump!
Where's the new kid?
Are you the ''one who sighs''?
Do you live down there?
Listen...
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.
Ass-kisser!
Throw him down! Go on!
He can't swim!
-Over there!
-Over there, to your left!
There he is!
Grab him! Careful!
What's going on?
What have l told you?
And you, eh?
What the fuck are you doing down here?
Whose is this?
Whose is this?
lt's mine.
lf anything happens to you, l get the blame.
Get out!
Out!
Say a word about this and l'll cut you in half.
Got that?
There you go.
Our Carlos has been here five minutes...
...and he's in trouble already.
Have you read any more of ''Monte-Cristo''?
Do you believe in ghosts?
There aren't any in the novel.
l think l saw one, here.
Carlos, as you can see,...
...l'm a man of science.
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.
And that, in turn, makes us see things.
in town...
...they call this...
...''the devil's backbone''
They say a lot of things.
That this happens to children
who shouldn't have been born.
''Nobody's children.'' But that's a lie.
Poverty and disease. That's all there is.
The liquid they're in is called ''limbo water''
ln the old days,
it was made with various spices...
...cloves, rum...
So this is very, very old rum.
l sell it in town...
...and the money keeps the school going.
Do they drink it?
They say it helps...
...to cure blindness, kidney ailments...
...and also, apparently,...
...impotence.
Rubbish, but you know...
After 60, men will pay anything just to...
You know.
So if you're going to believe in ghosts
and all that rubbish...
... you should have a sip of this...
...to heal your wound.
No, l'm not sure that l saw a ghost.
May l go now?
Yes, of course.
And be more careful?
Calm down.
l'm not going to hit you.
So don't make any noise.
Carlos...
...get out your comics so we can look at them.
-That ring is pretty.
-lt's from a oigar.
l found it four summers ago.
lt's very pretty.
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.
Look.
A naked woman.
lt's really well drawn, like a photo.
She's a looker! Who drew this?
Her pussy's the wrong way round.
lt looks like a mouth.
What would you lot know?
Look, a slice of fig cake.
lt's a bit squashed but it tastes good.
No, give me back my comics.
l want it back.
All right.
l'll give it to you later. lt's in my locker.
You're a real artist.
When l grow up, l want to draw comics.
Like mine?
No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.
And big ships with lots of cannons.
These bugs are disgusting. What do they eat?
Did you hear that?
A sigh.
l didn't hear it.
l heard it too.
Don't kiss me.
Right, l forgot.
This is the last time.
''This is the last time.''
Same old story.
Don't make any noise.
Scared the old man will hear?
l've never been scared.
l'm ashamed.
Yeah.
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.
He's a gentleman.
What a pity that isn't enough.
You need a hard cook as well.
And your husband and the doctor...
Tough luck.
The old man looks at you with love.
He did that even when your husband was alive.
l was 17.
By then, they took care of the poetry...
...and l of the flesh.
This leg...
l don't like to think about this leg.
lt hurts.
Some days l can't bear it.
But l need it to stay on my feet.
l saw those lights again today,...
...in the sky.
That's the war, it'll never end.
The war's shit.
Well, like it.
You like it, dickhead?
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.
My mother says that the earth's so dry here.
and the air's so hot...
...that the dead get stuck half way to heaven.
-That's rubbish!
-lt's like the ''one who sighs''.
Not that again, you little shit!
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.
Since then, no one has dared take Jaime on.
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.
Shit, l'm telling the story.
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...
...Santi got scared and ran away...
...and maybe some shepherds found him
and he's alive.
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.
Yeah.
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.
And where's the ghost?
lt came with the bomb.
Maybe if you ask it...
Take that one.
Out of the way.
Put those in, but be careful!
Don't break them.
Miss...
Look, l found this.
l thought you'd like it.
Open the gate, Jaime.
lt's lovely.
lt looks like gold, but it isn't.
Well, for me, it is.
lt's beautiful.
Thank you.
What's that?
Kids' stuff.
Can anyone tell me...
...what these elegant gentlemen are hunting?
-Galvez?
-A pig.
Well, a boar.
Why not a giraffe?
Carlos?
A mammoth.
-Very good. And what's a mammoth?
-An ancestor of the elephant.
Very good.
Your tutor taught you that.
ln those days, men had to act in groups.
No one could give up.
lmagine the death of a mammoth.
lt must have been terrible.
A mammoth steak, great!
When you get to draw your comics...
...l could help you write the stories.
l don't need anyone.
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?
Tomorrow, we'll continue with
the second part of prehistory.
Leave your things in the dormitory.
Then it's recess.
Santi...
-Satisfaction guaranteed.
-l hope so.
Here you go.
There isn't muoh.
Hey, you! Bastards!
What's going on?
lnternational Brigade. 2 Spaniards,
What the fuck's a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?
You, look at your damn feet!
Someone you know, doctor?
Bomb...
lf you're alive...
...tell me where Santi is.
Santi...
Talk to me.
l don't want anyone to die.
Many of you will die.
Please.
A grain of strength.
-You're up late.
-Please, give me a minute.
l need to talk to you,
but l don't want the boys to hear.
Things are very bad out there.
-ls something wrong?
-Yes.
We have to leave. Today if possible.
-Ayala was taken prisoner...
-Ayala?
Yes, l'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.
Go where?
To Marseille, with the Ricards.
-We can't stay here another minute.
-But l can't leave the boys!
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.
-We'll use the gold.
-The gold belongs to the cause.
fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!
l always thought there'd be an afterwards.
There is no afterwards!
Carmen...
...if anything happened you...
Doctor...
The boys are waiting for your permission
to have breakfast.
l'll need some papers.
But we'll go.
Boys, you may start.
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.
She's coming for me soon.
Last night l saw the ''one who sighs''
Last night?
You're making it up.
lt's Santi.
l'm sure.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
What about me?
Fuck me, right?
Well, good.
l want you to finish breakfast,
but while you're doing so...
...listen very carefully because
l have to tell you something...
You can go, but the gold stays here.
The gold?
ls that all you care about?
That's it.
What are you doing?
l hid you here so you wouldn't die outside...
-...with no one to mourn you.
-Give me the key.
You know what?
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.
The lost one.
A prince without a kingdom.
Shut up!
-The only one who was really alone.
-l said, shut up!
Get out of here, or l'll kill you!
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.
Will this weapon work?
You know that while you say sweet things
to this old hag...
...l'm the one who screws her?
And now...
...get out.
What did you see?
You know already.
l don't know anything. Tell me.
Santi.
He's the ''one who sighs''.
He's dead, isn't he?
Come on, boys.
Conchita...
Would you bring me a few cans of gas
for the journey?
Please, no!
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.
lt'll be a long journey.
The older boys will have to
look after the little ones.
lf any of you are scared you can sit with me.
What are you doing?
Are you all right, ma'am?
lt's my bad leg.
lt's heavier than ever.
Did you think someone would
just give us a farm?
What are you doing with that?
You're crazy.
They're all inside.
You going to shoot me?
Please...
-What was that?
-The children!
Get them out! lt's going to blow up!
Get out!
Outside!
Carmen?
Alma, leave it be, come on!
Get out!
All of you!
-l'm very cold.
-lt's all right.
Don't move.
Don't move, don't look.
ls it bad?
Fetch my bag from the lab. Quickly!
They won't have heard the explosion in town.
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.
lf l walk all night,
l'll get to town by noon tomorrow.
l've...
l've got something to tell you.
-lf l don't tell you now...
-No, please, don't.
l couldn't...
l can't hear you. So, please...
This time...
...let me do the talking.
-l've learned a new poem.
-Yes.
A poem.
''Stay by my side as my light grows dim,...
...as my blood slows down...
...and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain...
...as my heart grows weak...
...and the wheels of my being turn slowly.
Stay by my side...
...as my fragile body is racked by pain...
...which verges on truth...
...and manic time...
...continues scattering dust...
...and furious life bursts out in flames.
Stay by my side...
...as l fade...
...so you can point to the end of my struggle...
...and the twilight...
...of eternal days...
...at the low, dark edge of life.''
Miss...
A grain of strength.
Carlos, look.
Dr Casares...
That son of a bitch...
l should have killed him when l had the chance.
But he'll be back.
And l'll be here...
...waiting for him.
Carlitos...
...bring me...
...my records, my music.
l need them. All right?
Are you hungry?
''Eat beans, good for the heart.
The more you eat, the more you fart.''
My stomach's all upset.
But the little ones might be hungry.
Could you kill someone?
l could.
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.
But l didn't kill him.
-l thought...
-l was with him.
l saw everything.
lt started in the pit.
l dared him to come down with me
at night to gather slugs.
Run, Jaime. Jacinto's here.
-What did you see?
-Nothing.
-Did you see the safe?
-No.
Did you see the safe?
Why the fuck are you in here?
Who was with you?
Get up.
Get up.
l was a coward.
l was always afraid of Jacinto.
Very afraid.
But not anymore.
The next time l see him...
...l know l'm going to kill him.
Look who's here.
What'll he do?
Say you're sorry and get in the car.
l'm not scared of you.
You're making me look like a fool.
Say you're sorry, they're looking at us.
l'm not afraid of you.
Say you're sorry.
You're an animal.
Doctor, l did what you told me.
l did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.
Conchita...
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming, dootor!
Help me on my feet.
Jaime, put on the record.
Turn the horn towards the window.
Didn't you say he was dead?
Bastard!
Nobody knows anything. We're going to wait.
They're leaving!
All my life l've always stopped short...
...left things unfinished.
l'm not going to leave you alone, l promise you.
l will never leave this place.
We'll wait for you upstairs.
l'm not going to run away.
l want to talk to you.
Nothing.
They must have driven on.
Tell me, what do you want?
Jacinto.
Bring him to me.
l understand.
l'm going to help you.
Jaime! l saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!
l had to break the old man's fingers.
Even dead, he's stubborn.
Hurry up! Come on!
There's something here!
Marcelo! Out of the way!
Fucking great.
lt wasn't a complete waste of time.
This is yours, isn't it?
We have to get out of here.
One of us has to climb through the window.
And then open the door.
And what then?
What's wrong?
You scared?
Yea, l am, asshole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.
You're not bleeding, you're not even hurt.
Santi is dead.
Jacinto killed him.
lf we stay here, he'll kill us all.
Do you want to sit and wait?
You think that he'll let us go?
That it'll all work out if we behave?
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.
Yes, but there's more of us.
Wait!
Wait. Check if they're still working.
Go on.
All right.
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?
A bit.
fuck!
Look again!
There,s nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!
One of us has to go out and get Galvez.
Who'll do it?
l'll go.
No, not you. l'll go, l'm skinnier.
Who opened it?
Dr. Casares opened the door.
He said l'd be all right,
and that we should be brave.
There's no fucking gold here! You hear me?
You and your fancy ideas!
fuck!
Gold, gold... My ass!
My father.
He was from Canada.
He was an accountant.
My mother was from Toledo.
And that's me.
lt's blurred, 'cause l moved.
But that's me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal
could put us up?
We don't have much time.
''How lonely, the prince without a kingdom...
...the man without warmth.
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga.''
l saw that gold.
lt's here.
We just have to look for it.
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.
And the boys?
They've got no parents.
They've got no one. Who'll miss them?
We're at war.
A drop in the ocean.
Look, Jacinto.
Burn the place, kill the kids, l don't give a shit.
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.
-We need stuff from the car.
-Hurry up.
l'll need a hand.
Come on, Pig.
You're crazy, asshole!
fuck you!
No, fuck you! lt's all for me.
Son of a bitch!
What a joke!
Calvez, you go over there.
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle.
Santi...
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned to repeat itself
time and again?
A moment of pain, perhaps.
Something dead whioh still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
A ghost.
That's what l am.
TO MY PARENTS
