I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT DID.

THIS WHOLE THING IS 'CAUSE OF
YOU!
>> I-I'D TRADE PLACES WITH HIM
IF I COULD.
>> YOU ARE SO DEAD.
>> STOP IT! IT'S NOT HIS FAULT!
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.
IT WAS MY JUG FACE.
I HID IT.
>> WHAT?
>> I FOUND THE JUG FACE THAT
DAWAI MADE A FEW DAYS AGO...
AND IT WAS MINE.
I GOT SCARED, SO I BURIED IT IN
THE WOODS.
>> THE ONE HE COULDN'T FIND?
>> I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT.
>> GIVE IT TO HIM.
>> AAH!
AAH!
>> YOU SELFISH, LITTLE BITCH.
LOOK WHAT ALL YOU DONE.
YOU ALMOST RUINED US, 'CAUSE OF
WHAT?
'CAUSE OF YOUR DIRTY, LITTLE
SECRET?
TOMORROW, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!
TIE HER WITH DAWAI.
>> WHAT ABOUT OUR AGREEMENT?
>> THE PIT WANTS WHAT IT WANTS.
>>
>> I'M SORRY.
>> I'D HAVE TRIED TO SAVE MY
BABY, TOO.
IT AIN'T QUITE FAIR, IS IT?
I RECKON THEY'LL DO ME IN AFTER.
>> PROBABLY.
>> I DON'T CARE.
TIRED OF THEM, ANYWAY.
>> SLEEP TIGHT.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> COOPS WANTS YOU TO GO.
>> WAIT.
>> LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN.
>> WHAT ABOUT DAWAI?
>> HE MUST STAY.
>> THEY'LL KILL HIM.
>> GO.
ADA, PLEASE, JUST GO!
>> IF I GIVE MYSELF, WILL DAWAI
BE SPARED?
>> YES.
>> I'M STAYING, TH EN.
>> NO, YOU AIN'T!
YOU AIN'T STAYING.
ADA, GO.
HEY, WHERE YOU ALL GOING?
COME BACK HERE.
TAKE HER.
HEY!
HEY!
COME BACK HERE!
ADA, I WANT YOU TO GO.
I WANT YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE, AND
YOU LIVE A LIFE.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
YOU CAN GO TO TOWN.
>> I AM DOING THIS FOR YOU.
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THIS
FOR ME.
>> IT'S WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>>
I CAN'T BEAR IT.
I LOVE YOU.
>> WHO LET HER GO?
>> SHE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
ARE YOU READY TO GIVE YOURSELF
TO THE PIT, ONCE AND FOR ALL?
>> YES.
>> THE PIT GIVES, AND THE PIT
TAKES AWAY.
IT IS AN HONOR TO GO BE WITH IT,
AWAY FROM THIS EARTHLY PLANE.
I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH
OUR SACRIFICE.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PIT WANTS
WHAT IT WANTS.
IF YOU HAVE GOT ANYTHING TO SAY,
LET IT BE KNOWN.
>>
I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY FOR THOSE WHO DIED
'CAUSE OF WHAT I DONE.
AND I'M SORRY TO THOSE LEFT
BEHIND.
