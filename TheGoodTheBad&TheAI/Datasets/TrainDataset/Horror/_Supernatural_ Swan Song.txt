# carry on, my wayward son #
# there'll be peace
when you are done #
# lay your weary head to rest #
# don't you cry no more #
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,
And play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.
You're  vessel.
Michael's vessel.
The answer's no.
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.
You're the one, Sam.
You're my vessel.
That'll never happen.
# Ahh, Ahh, Ahh #
# once I rose above
the noise and confusion #
Hi, Lisa. Things are
about to get really bad.
Lisa: Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't do it.
I have to.
Gabriel:
- Bobby: Who is it?
- That's our brother.
- What do you mean Adam is gone?
- Castiel: The angels took him.
Maybe they're moving on
from you, Dean.
- Think Adam's okay?
- Adam: No.
Doubt it.
# I hear the voices
when I'm dreaming #
What if  guys lead the devil
to the edge and  jump in?
Are you idjits
trying to kill me?!
# carry on, my wayward son #
Death: You're going to
let your brother
jump right into that fiery pit.
What exactly are you afraid of?
Losing?
Or losing your brother?
# don't you cry no more #
Chuck:
But they should have.
No, the most important
in pretty much
the whole universe.
"Gettin' folks
right for judgment day."
And here's where it ends.
Hey.
Dean?
What's going on?
I'm in.
In with...?
The whole
"up with Satan" thing.
I'm on board.
You're gonna let me say yes?
No. That's the thing.
It's not on me
to  you do anything.
You're a grown...
well,  man.
If this is what you want,
I'll back your play.
That's the last thing
I thought you'd ever say.
Might be.
I'm not gonna lie to you, though...
it goes against
every fiber I got.
I mean, truth is...
you know, watching out for you...
It's kinda been my job, you know?
But more than that, it's...
it's kinda who I am.
You're not a kid anymore, Sam...
and I can't keep
treating you like one.
Maybe  got to grow up
a little, too.
I don't know if we got
a snowball's chance.
But...
but I do know
that if anybody can do it...
it's you.
Thank you.
If this is what you want...
is this
I let him out.
I got to put him back in.
Okay.
That's it, then.
Season 5 Episode 22
"Swan Song"
I still can't get used
to you at eye level.
So, was I right?
As always, Yoda.
Two stunt demons inside,
just like you said.
Did you get it?
Yeah, all the "go juice"
Sammy can drink.
You okay?
Not really.
What do you got?
Not much.
These look like omens to you?
Cyclone in Florida,
temperature drop in Detroit,
wildfires in L.A.
Wait. What about Detroit?
Temp's dropped
about 20 degrees,
but only in a five-block radius
of downtown Motown.
That's the one.
Devil's in Detroit.
Really?
As far as foreboding goes,
it's a little light
in the loafers.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Aw. Ain't he
a little angel?
Angels don't sleep.
Sam, I got a bad feeling
about this.
Well, you'd be nuts
to have a  feeling about it.
You know what I mean.
Detroit.
He always said he'd jump
your bones in Detroit.
Here we are.
Here we are.
Maybe this is him rolling out
the red carpet, you know?
Maybe he knows something
that we don't.
Dean, I'm sure
he knows a  we don't.
We just got to hope
he doesn't know about the rings.
Hey, um...
On the subject, there's something
I got to talk to you about.
What?
This thing goes our way
and I... triple Lindy
into that box...
y-you know
I'm not coming back.
Yeah, I'm aware.
So you got to
promise me something.
Okay. Yeah, anything.
You got to promise
not to try to bring me back.
What?
No, I didn't sign up for that.
Dean...
Your hell is gonna make my tour
look like Graceland.
Y-you want me just to sit by
and do nothing?
Once the cage is shut,
you  go poking at it, Dean.
- It's too risky.
- No, no, no, no, no.
As if I'm just gonna
let you rot in there.
Yeah, you are.
You don't have a choice.
You can't ask me to do this.
I'm sorry, Dean.
You  to.
So then what am I
supposed to do?
You go find Lisa.
You pray to God she's
dumb enough to take you in,
and you... you have barbecues
and go to football games.
You go live some normal,
apple-pie life, Dean.
Promise me.
Bobby: Demons.
At least two dozen of them.
You were right... something's up.
More than something.
He's here, I know it.
I'll see ya around, kid.
See ya around.
He gets in...
you fight him tooth and nail,
you understand?
Keep swingin', don't give an inch.
Yes, sir.
You take care of these guys, okay?
That's not possible.
Then humor me.
Oh, I was supposed to lie.
Uh...
Sure. They'll be fine. I...
Just...
just stop... talking.
You mind not watching this?
Okay.
Let's go.
All right!
We're here,
you sons of bitches!
Come and get it!
Hey, guys.
Is your father home?
Hey, guys.
So nice of you to drop in.
Chuck:
don't.
is the stuff
that's important.
really
Sorry if it's a bit chilly.
Most people think I burn hot.
It's actually quite the opposite.
Well, I'll alert the media.
Help me understand something,
guys.
I mean, stomping through
my front door
is... a tad suicidal,
don't you think?
We're not here to fight you.
No?
- Then why are you?
- I want to say "yes."
Excuse me?
Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?
You heard me.
Yes.
You're serious.
Look, judgment day's
a runaway train.
We get it now,
we just want off.
Meaning?
Deal of the century.
I give you a free ride,
but when it's all over,
I live, he lives,
you bring our parents back...
Okay, can we please
drop the Telenovela?
I know you have the rings, Sam.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
The Horsemen's rings?
The magic keys to my cage?
Ring a bell?
Come on, Sam.
I've never lied to you.
You could at least
pay me the same respect.
It's okay. I'm not mad.
A wrestling match
inside your noggin...
I like the idea.
Just you and me,
one round, no tricks.
You win, you jump in the hole.
win...
well, then I win.
What do you say, Sam?
A fiddle of gold
against your soul
says I'm better than you-ou.
So he knows.
Doesn't change anything.
Sam.
- We don't have any other choice.
- No.
Yes.
Sammy!
- Dean!
- Sammy!
I can feel him.
- Oh, God!
- You got to go now!
Come on!
Go now, Sammy.
Now!
I was just messing with you.
Sammy's long gone.
I told you...
this would always happen
in Detroit.
Sam.
Come on.
I can feel you...
scratching away in there.
Look...
I'll take the gag off, okay?
You got me all wrong, kiddo.
I'm not the bad guy here.
I'm gonna rip you apart
from the inside out.
Do you understand me?
Such anger...
young Skywalker.
Who are you
Me?
Or that face in the mirror?
I'm sure this is all
a big joke to you, huh?
Not at all.
I've been waiting for you...
for a long,  time.
Come on, Sam.
You have to admit...
you can feel it, right?
- What?
- The exhilaration.
And you know why that is?
Because we're two halves
made whole.
M.F.E.O.
Literally.
This feels
pretty damn far from good.
I'm inside
your grapefruit, Sam.
You can't lie to me.
I see it all.
How odd you always felt,
how... out of place
in that... family of yours.
And why shouldn't you have?
They were foster care... at best.
your real family.
No, that's not true.
It is.
And I know you know it.
All those times you ran away,
you weren't running
from
You were running
towards
This doesn't have to be
a bad thing, you know.
I let Dean live, didn't I?
I  him to live.
I'll bring your folks
back, too.
I want you to be happy, Sam.
I don't want
Really?
Not even a little payback?
What's that supposed to mean?
Look closely.
None of these little devils
look familiar to you?
That's Mr. Bensman.
One of my grade-school teachers.
And that's your friend Doug
from that time in East Lansing.
And Rachel...
your prom date.
Sam Winchester,
this is your life.
Azazel's gang...
watching you since
you were a rug-rat.
Jerking you around
like a dog on a leash.
I know how you feel about them.
Me too.
So, what do you say you and I
blow off a little steam?
Reporter: Reports are flooding in... a 7.6
earthquake in Portland,
It's starting.
Yeah, you think, genius?
You don't have to be mean.
So what do we do now?
I suggest we imbibe
copious quantities of alcohol.
Just wait for the
inevitable blast wave.
Yeah, swell.
Thank you, Bukowski.
I-I mean,
how do we stop it?
We don't.
Lucifer  meet Michael
on the chosen field,
and the battle of Armageddon begins.
Okay, well,
where's this chosen field?
I don't know.
Well, there's got to be
something that we can do.
I'm sorry, Dean.
This is over.
You listen to me,
you junk-less sissy...
we are  giving up!
Bobby?
Bobby?
There was never much hope
to begin with.
I don't know what else to do.
So...
are we having fun yet?
Chuck:
week,
That's a good line.
Mistress Magda?
Dean: Um, no, Chuck.
Oh, uh, Dean.
Uh, wow. I, uh,
I didn't know that you'd call.
Who's Mistress Magda?
Nothing. She's a, uh, a...
Just a, uh... a close friend.
Yeah, I'll bet...  close.
Whatever happened to Becky?
You know, it didn't work out.
I had too much respect for her.
Boy, you really got a whole virgin/hooker
thing going on, don't you?
Okay, this can't be
why you called.
Sam said yes.
I know.
I saw it.
I'm just working on the pages.
Did you see where
the title fight goes down?
The angels are keeping it
top secret.
Very hush-hush.
Aw, crap.
But I saw it anyway.
Perks of being a prophet.
It's tomorrow, high noon...
place called Stull cemetery.
Stull ceme...
Wait. I know that.
That's... that's an old bone-yard
outside of Lawrence.
Why Lawrence?
I don't know.
It all has to end
where it started, I guess.
All right, Chuck.
You know of any way
to short-circuit this thing?
Besides the rings?
No. I'm sorry.
Well, do you have any idea
what's gonna happen next?
I wish that I did.
But I-I just...
I honestly don't know yet.
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
You goin' someplace?
You're goin'
to do somethin' stupid.
You got that look.
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.
You just don't give up.
It's Sam!
Castiel: If you couldn't
reach him here,
You're certainly not gonna be
able to on the battlefield.
Well, if we've already lost,
I guess I got
nothing to lose, right?
I just want you
to understand...
The  thing
that you're gonna see out there
is Michael killing your brother.
Well, then I ain't
gonna let him die alone.
It's good to see you, Michael.
You too.
It's been too long.
Can you believe
it's finally here?
No.
Not really.
Are you ready?
As I'll ever be.
A part of me wishes
we didn't have to do this.
Yeah.
Me too.
Then why  we?
Oh, you know why.
I have no choice,
after what you did.
What I did?
What if it's not my fault?
What is that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
Dad made everything.
Which means
he  me who I am.
God  the devil.
So?
So why?
And why make us fight?
I just can't
figure out the point.
What's  point?
We're going to kill each other.
And for what?
One of dad's tests.
And we don't even
know the answer.
We're brothers.
Let's just
walk off the chessboard.
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do that.
I'm a good son,
and I have my orders.
But you don't
have to follow them.
What,
you think I'm gonna rebel?
Now?
I'm not like you.
Please, Michael...
You know, you haven't changed
a bit, little brother.
Always blaming
everybody but yourself.
We were together.
We were happy.
But you betrayed me,
all of us...
and you made our father leave.
No one makes dad do
He is doing this  us.
You're a monster, Lucifer.
And I have to kill you.
If that's the way
it's got to be...
then I'd like
to see you try.
# Gunter, glieben,
glauchen, globen #
# all right #
# I got something to say #
# hey #
# it's better to burn out #
# yeah #
# than fade awa-a-a-y #
# all right #
# oh! #
Howdy, boys.
# we're gonna burn
this damn place down #
# ooh, ooh #
# down to the ground #
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?
Hey.
We need to talk.
Dean.
Even for you,
this is a whole new
mountain of stupid.
I'm not talking to
You're no longer
the vessel, Dean.
You got no right to be here.
Adam, if you're in there
somewhere, I am so sorry.
Adam isn't home right now.
Well, then you're next
on my list, Buttercup.
But right now, I need
five minutes with
You little maggot.
You are no longer
a part of this story!
Hey, ass-butt!
"Ass-butt"?
He'll be back... and upset...
but you got your five minutes.
Castiel.
Did you just Molotov
my brother with holy fire?
Uh... no.
No one dicks with
Michael, but
Sammy, can you hear me?
You know...
I tried to be nice...
for Sammy's sake.
But you...
are such a pain...
in my ass.
N-o-o-o-o!
Yes.
Sammy?
Are you in there?
Oh, he's in there, all right.
And he's gonna feel
the snap of your bones.
Every single one.
We're gonna take our time.
Sam, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna leave you.
It's okay, Dean.
It's gonna be okay.
I've got him.
Michael: Sam!
It's not gonna end this way!
Step back!
You're gonna
have to  me!
I have to fight
my brother, Sam!
Here and now!
It's my destiny!
Cass, you're alive?
I'm better than that.
Cass, are you God?
That's a nice compliment,
but no.
Although, I do believe
he brought me back.
New and improved.
Chuck:
What are you gonna do now?
Return to heaven, I suppose.
Heaven?
With Michael in the cage,
I'm sure it's total
anarchy up there.
So, what... you're
the new sheriff in town?
I like that. Yeah,
I suppose I am.
Wow.
God gives you a brand-new,
shiny set of wings,
and suddenly
you're his bitch again.
I don't know
God wants.
I don't know
if he'll even return.
It just... seems like
the right thing to do.
Well, if you do see him...
you tell him
I'm coming for him next.
You're angry.
That's an understatement.
He helped.
Maybe even
more than we realize.
That's easy for  to say.
He brought you back.
But what about Sam?
What about  huh?
Where's my grand prize?
All I got is
my brother in a hole!
You got what you asked for, Dean.
No paradise. No hell.
Just more of the same.
I mean it, Dean.
What would you rather have?
Peace or freedom?
Well, you really suck
at goodbye's, you know that?
Hey, Lisa.
Oh, thank God.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Uh, if it's not too late, I...
think I'd like
to take you up on that beer.
It's never too late.
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
