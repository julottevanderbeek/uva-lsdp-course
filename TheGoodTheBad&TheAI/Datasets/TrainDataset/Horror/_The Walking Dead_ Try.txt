I told you...
to stop!
Carl, this is Enid.
Hi.
Enid's from outside, too.
I want you to help me be
Alexandria's other recruiter.
Pete's hitting Jessie.
There's only one way it can go.
The others before...
they didn't panic.
We did.
They're here!
Nicholas don't!
No!
No!
No!
Turn it off.
There's more of them around
here than there used to be.
- Don't know if any people are--
- Shh.
Someone is.
Aiden was trying to save us
from a roamer,
shooting at it.
Then Glenn distracted him.
I saw the grenades.
I tried to stop him.
They wanted to just go,
I didn't.
He was gonna run.
Nicholas:
Deanna:
I wasn't gonna leave her.
But we made him stay.
Couldn't get Aiden
out of there without help.
Then when we got
into the lobby...
All he had to do
was hold the door.
Nicholas:
pushing my door open.
They were gonna kill me.
But he panicked.
Or they were trying to.
Or they just didn't care.
Noah, I had him.
I had his hand.
And if I didn't push back,
I'd be dead, too.
I tried.
I watched him die.
Nicholas:
Deanna: But you all
came back together.
Spencer:
Deanna: I need it for later.
We have to do this now.
Same goes for Glenn until I
finish looking into this.
Nicholas: What do you
need to look into?
I-- I'm telling you
how it went down.
These people have to go.
They are not like us.
Deanna: You don't know
what I see, Nicholas.
I almost left him out there.
Could have told a story.
What, you think I should have?
They don't know
what they're doing.
- Any of them.
- We'll show them.
I don't know if they can see it.
How things really are.
I don't know if they can yet.
- They haven't caught up.
- We have to be here.
- We have to.
- Yeah, we do.
But their rules,
we don't answer to them.
We are them, Rick.
We are now.
I'm telling you,
we gotta make this work.
I sent a casserole
to Deanna's family.
We want her to see that.
Have you thought about Pete?
About what I said?
Yeah.
Talked to Sam some more.
He said his mom put a bolt
on the inside of his closet.
Tells him to lock
himself in sometimes
and not come out till morning.
Last month it got quiet
right in the middle of it
and he went out and
found her on the floor
Pete was just sitting
on the porch.
Why do you care
what happens to Jessie?
You know why.
And I know why you do.
Why?
I've seen you talk to her.
Carol: If walkers
hadn't gotten Ed,
I wouldn't be standing
here right now.
Yeah, you would.
Hey, Rick.
Rick.
You okay, man?
Keep walking.
What?
What are you--
Come in.
Hey.
- How is she?
- Stable.
Hanging on. I'm gonna
go back there later.
I think Sasha might have spent
the night in the tower.
Is she still up there?
Abraham's on watch now,
but she hasn't been back
and nobody's seen her.
Rosita:
It's up ahead.
She told you about it?
I saw her going out
one day with her rifle.
I knew somebody was already in the tower.
I asked.
It's the first time I've been
out since we've been here.
Me, too.
It already feels different.
That's good.
I don't know.
After Eugene,
after finding out he lied,
I was screwed up
because I lost something.
You seem screwed up
because we found something.
Noah's dead.
And I think--
I just feel like
I was asleep in there.
You were trying to
forget so you could try.
- I don't want to forget.
- So don't.
But that doesn't mean
you have to give up.
You didn't bring
your sword with you.
That's not nothing.
I'm sorry for what happened.
How are you holding up?
I'm not.
We have a problem with Pete.
I hoped it'd get better.
You knew?
It hasn't gotten better.
It won't.
Pete's a surgeon.
He's saved lives.
He might be saving Tara's life.
He's beating his wife.
- We have to stop it.
- How?
We separate them.
We tell him that's how
it'll be from now on.
What happens when he
doesn't want to do that?
It's not his choice.
So what happens?
I kill him.
We kill him.
We don't kill people.
This is civilization, Rick.
Warning someone to stop or die,
- that is civilized nowadays.
- Oh.
So what? So we just
let him hit her?
We let him kill her?
No, we exile him
if it comes to that.
We do that, we don't
know when he comes back
and what he does to them.
Letting him go makes
this place vulnerable.
You really want to wait till someone
in that tower has to take care of it?
- And that's if we're lucky.
- We are not...
executing anyone.
Don't ever suggest it again.
That sort of thinking
doesn't belong in here.
People die now, Deanna.
They do.
There's times like this
you can decide who and when.
Or it can be decided for you.
It already was.
I wouldn't kill you.
I'd just send you away.
Michonne: Got it in
the back of the head.
Had to be her.
Back of the head.
She's hunting them.
Enid:
You knew?
Enid:
You shouldn't sneak out
by yourself.
Two people just died.
Oh, come on.
People always die.
You know that.
We should go back.
Why?
What do you do out here anyways?
Same thing as you.
Nicholas, don't talk,
just listen.
Those four people
you lost on that run,
that's on you.
And Noah, that's on you, too.
Those five lives,
you have to carry that.
People like you
are supposed to be dead,
but these walls
went up just in time,
so you're not.
You don't go outside
those walls anymore.
Not by yourself,
not with anyone else.
And that's how
you're gonna survive.
Who the hell
do you think you are?
I'm someone who knows
who you are.
I know what you did.
And it's not gonna happen again.
I've been protecting this place,
helping provide for it.
You just got here.
Don't forget what I said.
Are you threatening me?
No.
I'm saving you.
We're supposed to be out here.
We're supposed
to feel like this.
I don't want to forget.
And running
makes me feel better.
I can't forget.
I dream about it.
Being in the forest with them.
I do, too.
Ron's a good guy.
He is.
Does he know you come out here?
No, I--
he wouldn't understand.
Why do I scare you?
I don't know.
You just do.
Cool knife.
It was my mom's.
What happened to you
before you got there?
Does it matter?
It does.
I know.
Something bad has
happened to me, too.
We need to go.
Sounds like a lot.
It's their world.
We're just living in it.
Cool.
You're afraid of me, too.
- Michonne: Sasha.
-
-
- Go back.
What are you doing?
I'm sick of playing defense.
So you're just gonna
take on all of them?
Yeah.
Rosita:
You do, I don't.
- I don't need your help.
- This isn't for you.
I had it.
Don't need your help.
I told you to go.
You...
you can't do anything.
It worked out for you.
Don't you see that?
Nobody--
Noah.
I told him he wouldn't make it.
Whoever did this took
what was left with them.
This just happened.
She's tied up.
And they fed on her.
Tore her apart.
This just happened?
Yeah.
How the hell did this happen?
Jessie.
Hey.
I don't want Ron and Sam
to know about those.
Well, your secret's safe.
Noah was a sweet kid.
But Tara, she's--
she's in good hands with Pete.
He's hitting you.
He's hurting you.
It has to stop.
- It will.
- How?
There are things in his
life that happened.
I don't care.
Look, it was like this
before and he got help.
I helped him
and things were good.
I can fix it.
No, you can't.
But I can.
No, what--
what can you do?
What are you gonna do?
You gonna put him in jail?
You're only gonna
make things worse.
If it's gotten worse,
it means he's killed you.
That's what's next.
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.
Why do you care?
Why is this so important to you?
Now?
You've made it.
You have a home for your kids.
Rick, what are you doing?
I'm trying to help.
I don't know that.
I'm married.
Okay? I can take care of myself.
We have to take care
of ourselves.
What are you doing?
You know Sam asked for a gun?
To protect you.
You shouldn't be here.
Jessie, in here,
you can't see it,
but it's the same.
It's the same as out there.
We have food and roofs
over our heads,
but you don't get to just live.
You don't get to put it off
or wish it away, Jessie.
If you don't fight, you die.
And...
and I don't want you to die.
I can--
I can help you.
I can keep you
and your boys safe.
I can.
All you have to do is say yes.
Would you do this
for someone else?
Would you do this for anyone?
No. No.
Yes.
Rick.
What are you doing here?
Pete.
What are you doing here?
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, Rick.
No.
Excuse me?
You need to leave.
What are you talking about?
Just go, Pete.
What have you been
saying to each other?
Huh?
What have you been doing?!
Pete, you and me
are gonna leave now.
You come into my house...
Pete, you and me are leaving.
Pete:
You think you're the law?
You actually think you have
a say in anything here?
- Step back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?
Someone who's trying
not to kill you.
No!
- You wanna stop now!
-
Come into my house?!
- Pete, stop it!
- It's my house!
Pete, stop it!
-
- Jessie:
Deanna!
Ah!
Dad, get off!
Deanna:
Stop it right now.
You touch them again
and I'll kill you.
Damn it, Rick!
I said stop.
Or what?
You gonna kick me out?
Put that gun down, Rick.
You still don't get it.
None of you do!
Rick: We know what needs
to be done and we do it.
Rick:
You, you just sit
and plan and hesitate.
You pretend like you know
when you don't.
-
-
Rick: You wish things
weren't what they are.
Your way of doing
things is done.
Things don't get better
because you-- you want them to.
Starting right now,
we have to live
in the real world.
We have to control
who lives here.
That's never been
more clear to me
than it is right now.
Me? Me? You--
You mean-- you mean me?
Your way is gonna
destroy this place.
It's gonna get people killed.
It's already gotten
people killed.
And I'm not gonna stand by
and just let it happen.
If you don't fight, you die.
I'm not gonna stand by--
