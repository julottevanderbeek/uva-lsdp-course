NARRATOR:
MICK:
I saw Coraline last night.
JOSEF: Coraline is dead.
- You look like someone I used to know.
- Ex-girlfriend, maybe?
- Ex-wife.
- She's found a cure.
- There is no cure for vampirism.
One of these days, you're gonna
have to stop hating what you are.
- What could be the downside?
- Missing the things that you loved.
Turn me. Turn me.
- Lf she is back, what does she want?
- She's back for Mick.
She's been lying to us, stalking us.
No. She's not a vampire.
She's human. She has a cure.
The object missed her heart,
but punctured her left lung...
...and partially tore the pericardium.
- Is she gonna live?
It's a deep wound
and infection has already set in.
That's her biggest concern right now.
That and a buildup of fluid
around the heart.
You know, it's a very unusual wound.
I understand she told the ER doctor
that it was some sort of accident.
- Do you know what happened?
- No, we don't know what happened.
Well, all we can do now
is monitor her.
- I'll let you know if there's any change.
- Thank you very much.
Why did she lie?
Why didn't she tell them I did it?
She wouldn't want the police involved.
I can't believe I almost killed her. L...
I thought for sure she was a vampire.
You couldn't have known.
I didn't even know.
You still care for her, don't you?
She was my wife.
You really think
there's some kind of cure?
MICK:
Coraline was a vampire for years...
...and now she's as human
as you are.
Something changed her back.
And if she dies...
...I'll never know what that was...
...or how she did it.
Did you find him?
That's him. Where is he?
He's living is Los Angeles,
using the name Josef Kostan.
- What do you want me to do?
- What I hired you to do.
- Kill him.
- I'll take the next flight out.
- It has to be done with fire.
- Fire's impractical.
- Long range, a single shot to the head...
- No.
It has to be fire.
- Why fire?
- Because I've said so.
Burn him to death,
and you'll get your money.
Consider it done.
Trust me on this one, fellas.
You mix it up with mortal girls,
never ends well.
TIM: What?
DAN: You can turn them not mortal.
JOSEF: It's too much commitment.
- So you're saying, never turn a girl ever?
I'm saying forever's a long time.
- I know what you're saying.
JOSEF: All right, bets.
I'm in...
...with three AB negatives.
I'm out.
- What do you got?
- Two pair.
- Two pair, that's it?
JOSEF: Yeah.
DAN: Flush beats that.
- Of fives.
I guess tonight's my night, boys.
TOM: I'm glad to see you're here,
Mr. St. John.
- What happened, Tom?
- We're still putting the pieces together.
- There aren't many pieces left.
- Josef?
Forensics haven't found
any remains yet, just ash.
Whoever did this brought an awful lot
of firepower to take out just one man.
- How did they get in?
- Had to be real pros.
I've been the head of security
for Mr. Kostan for five years.
There's no way anyone should have been
able to get anywhere near this office.
MAUREEN: Great, you're still here.
That's why I love you.
I just had to finish up some copy.
I spent the afternoon in the hospital.
Yeah, Morgan. How's she doing?
She's in pretty bad shape.
Does anyone know
how she hurt herself?
No, she's still unconscious.
Cheer up.
I've got something
to take your mind off Morgan.
Explosion in a downtown office building
took out the top floor.
- Terrorists?
- No.
Apparently the target
was this bigshot hedge-fund trader.
Oh, my God, that's Josef Kostan.
He's a friend of Mick's.
Okay, I take it back.
This is why I love you.
- Was he there?
- Afraid so.
No survivors.
Have a cameraman
meet you down there.
I wanna know
the who, what and why.
I can't cover this.
This guy's a friend of Mick's.
Great. Use that
to show some vulnerability.
Tracking says women 18 to 34
find you a little harsh.
It was poker night.
- I was supposed to be here.
- I'm so sorry.
Yeah, me too.
Who could've done this?
They used fire. They must have
known he was a vampire.
Josef had enemies, but this...
- Who could hate him this much?
- Yeah.
You brought your camera guy?
That's why you're here,
you're on a story?
- Look, Maureen sent me.
- Beth, just go away.
They were gonna send
someone here to cover this story.
- Wouldrt you rather it was me?
- My friend just died.
I don't really
wanna talk to you right now.
No, actually,
you stay and get your story.
You do your job, I'll do mine.
MICK: Josef had cameras installed
in every office.
Top-of-the-line.
Offices, hallways, elevators...
...parking structure, basement,
even the boiler room.
He even wanted
infrared cameras installed.
I don't know why, but he insisted.
MICK:
Here, this is him.
He must have come in
with the maintenance crew.
When I saw him go
into Mr. Kostars office...
...I headed up there,
but it was too late.
Wait, stop. Stop right there.
Can you zoom in on the incendiaries?
Those look military-grade.
- I need a copy of this footage.
- Sure.
Anything I can do to help get this guy.
- Yeah.
WOMAN:
- Yes.
-
How's she doing? Is she okay?
Her wound shows
some signs of healing.
She's been in
and out of consciousness.
- Can I talk to her?
- Just a few minutes, she needs to rest.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Coraline.
You look like someone just died.
Someone did.
It's Josef.
Oh, God.
I remember introducing you two.
You thought he was a pompous jerk...
...and he thought
you werert cut out to be a vampire.
We were both probably right.
- But you were best friends anyways.
- Yeah, we were.
And now he's gone.
But I'm back.
You have to tell me how.
How I survived the fire
that you thought killed me?
- How you became human.
- It always comes back to this.
You're so desperate
to be mortal again...
...to experience death for yourself.
Why?
It's Beth, isn't it?
You think you love her.
This is not about Beth, okay?
I came back for you.
I became human for you.
- Doesrt that mean anything?
- How, Coraline?
For you.
You have to tell me how.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Look, I overreacted.
- Look, I'm really so...
I shouldn't have brought a camera
into Josef's office. I'm so sorry.
This is just really hard for me,
all of it.
Coraline's in the hospital,
Josef's dead.
I know he meant a lot to you.
I've outlived so many of my friends...
...you think I'd be used to
losing people by now.
Yeah, but losing Josef's different.
He survived 400 years.
Four hundred years.
He saw so much. So much history.
He was history.
And now he's gone.
And that loss to me is so enormous...
...that I'm not even sure
if I know how to mourn him.
- I need a drink.
- Yeah, me too.
Are you gonna stand there all day...
...or are you gonna help me
find out who killed me?
MICK: Recognize that guy?
JOSEF: No, I've never seen him before.
- Is he a vampire?
- Showed up as human on your infrareds.
- Does he know Josef's a vampire?
- Well, they did use fire.
The other people he killed, your friends,
were they vampires too?
Mm-hm.
Well, remind me to donate a
little something to charity in their name.
Oh, wait. I can't.
I have no money.
I have no office, I have no anything.
Because some janitor decided
to whack me, in a very public...
..." hard to explain how
I'm still alive" kind of way.
So everyone thinks I'm dead.
Yeah, and it has to stay that way.
This janitor is a professional assassin
with access to military-grade weaponry.
Somebody hired him...
...and you're only gonna be safe
so long as he thinks he succeeded.
So find him and whack him,
so I can carry on with business.
Where are you going?
Well, your assassin
may be ex-military.
I'm gonna see if your buddy
Ryder England can get me into their files.
- He can't.
- He can't hack the military?
Oh, he can. He did.
That's why he's on a sabbatical
in South America now.
I know somebody. Sam, does
some computer work at
Okay, let's go.
You, stay.
You do not leave this apartment.
Is this the only time
we get a clear look at his face?
- Yeah.
MAN 1: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
- Is there a problem?
- No, I just...
When Beth said she knew
a hacker named Sam, l...
You thought I was a guy.
Overweight, living
in my parents' basement...
...wearing a T-shirt with Yoda on it?
- Yeah.
- Mick's kind of old-school.
- Yeah.
MAN 2: Hey, man. Yeah.
Okay, if this guy was special ops,
he went through basic training.
He had his picture taken
for his military ID.
I'm using facial-recognition software
to cross-reference your image...
...with the Pentagors ID database.
- How do you have access to that?
- Don't ask, don't tell.
Ralf Martan.
Completed his training at Fort Bragg.
Ex-military, Green Beret, special ops.
He spent a year in Afghanistan
and then went to Iraq.
Was discharged and then went back
as part of Darkwatch Associates.
He's a mercenary.
SAM: Looks like he got into
some trouble over there.
Went solo, disappeared from radar
about six months ago.
Jeez, talk about born to kill.
You guys sure
you wanna find this guy?
JOSEF: Okay, we're gonna play
a little game here.
The rules are I make the rules.
Okay, now you kiss her.
- There you go.
WOMAN 1: That's hot.
JOSEF:
Oh, my God, is it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, you're back.
Sorry. Sorry, party's over.
Excuse me.
- But they just got here.
- What did I tell you?
Well, you told me not to go out,
so I ordered in.
What, do you got a death wish?
Get them out of here now.
I'm sorry, ladies.
Daddy's a little grumpy.
We're gonna have to
pick this up later.
WOMAN 1: God.
WOMAN 2: I know.
WOMAN 1: Bye, Josef.
WOMAN 3: I love your place.
WOMAN 2:
Love you. Bye-bye.
I don't believe this. What if
they tell someone you're alive?
You want this guy
throwing a firebomb in here?
Wreck my place, huh?
Burn me up like he did Tim and Dan?
What's the matter with you?
You didn't even think about it, did you?
Did you even think about it
for one second?
You don't care about yourself.
Can you at least care
about not getting me killed?
Listen, I wasrt, like...
Look, I get lonely, man.
You know that.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see why.
The hacker got the assassirs name.
- Ralf Martan, do you know him?
- Martan, Martan.
No.
Apparently, he's some born killer.
Special ops, Darkwatch, Afghanistan.
You know, the last time I was there,
the British were invading.
Hey, I need to go to my office.
- Are you kidding?
- No, I have a fireproof safe.
I need to get some cash.
- You don't need cash.
- No, I gotta get it.
I can't drink your store-bought blood.
I need some fresh AB negative.
Your office is... Your office
is not a safe place. This...
I'm going to bed.
And what am I supposed to do?
Why don't you tidy up, man?
- Are you sure these vitals are right?
- I checked them myself.
So our patient has a raging infection,
but instead of spiking a fever...
...her temperature's dropped
two degrees in the past six hours?
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Try again. This can't be right.
It's okay, I'm just checking your vitals.
- I'm dying.
- Shh. Calm down now.
It's so strange.
But I'm not supposed to...
There you go. Nice and comfy.
TOM:
Stop right there.
- Mr. Kostan?
- Hi, Tom.
I can't believe it.
I thought about calling first,
but I didn't wanna make a big deal.
- You're alive, but how?
- It's a long story.
You're the only one
who knows I'm still alive.
We need to keep this between us.
Josef.
I called as soon as he showed.
Figured there might be
something extra in it for me.
There is.
You've already died once this week.
Isn't that enough?
Who are you working for?
Answer me. Who hired you?
Now, I don't like
repeating myself. Huh?
- Whitley.
- Whitley?
John Whitley.
He's a real-estate guy in New York.
You know that name?
- Whitley?
- I don't think so.
Don't lie to me, Josef.
He certainly seemed to know you.
MICK: Give me a hand
lifting this guy, will you?
Josef.
MAN:
All right, watch your head.
What's your connection
to all this, Mick?
I'm investigating the death
of Josef Kostan.
- This guy firebombed the building?
- I'm pretty sure.
He looks like the guy
I saw on the tapes.
- What'd he come back for?
- I don't know.
The security guy's dead.
Maybe he was a loose end.
We'll look into it. Good job.
Listen, be careful with this guy.
- He's dangerous.
- Hey, we do this for a living.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I checked out that name you got.
I found a John Whitley in New York.
He's 93.
A wealthy real-estate developer. At one
point, he owned half the Upper East Side.
It must be our guy.
No family.
His wife died two years ago.
He had a daughter
who disappeared in 1955.
You think Josef's after him?
Josef's sense of justice
is pretty much an eye for an eye.
- Where are you going?
- New York.
I have to stop Josef
before he does something stupid.
- I'm going with you.
- Why?
To stop you
from doing something stupid.
WOMAN :
Hey... Josh.
Oh, God, I completely forgot.
It's movie night, isn't it?
- We need to talk.
- Come in.
Are you...?
Are you going somewhere?
Yes, to New York.
- You know, the Josef Kostan story.
- Thought that was wrapped up.
No.
- So are you going alone?
- No.
You and Mick, I bet, huh?
When were you gonna tell me?
I was gonna call you from the air...
Airport.
Look...
- This isn't working.
- It's just a case.
- A case?
- A story, whatever, work. It's...
Look me in the eye right now...
...and tell me
you don't have feelings for him.
Look me in the eye and tell me that.
You ready?
I can... I'll come back.
- No.
JOSH: No, I was just leaving.
You two have fun in New York.
- Lf you need to stay...
- No, it's okay.
Let's go.
Shh.
How'd you get in here?
I work for you, remember?
What are you doing?
Josef Kostan, tell me about him.
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not.
He walked away from an explosion
no one could possibly have survived.
His friend threw me
across the room with one arm.
You're gonna tell
how this is possible...
...or I'll put an air bubble
into your bloodstream.
And you're gonna stroke out
without having gotten your revenge.
He's a vampire.
- That's not funny, old man.
- No, it's not.
Now tell me everything about them.
Tell me how to kill them.
Mr. Kostan,
we've been expecting you.
Yes, sir. I will.
I'm sorry,
Mr. Whitley isn't receiving visitors.
- Please can you ask him again?
- He was very clear.
- This is really important.
- I'm sure it is.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?
Yes, can you tell him
it's regarding Josef Kostan?
- No way.
- Hey, we asked nicely.
They said no.
After you.
Mr. Whitley, there are people here.
I'm not sure how they got in.
Should I call the police?
Mr. Whitley,
we think you might be in danger.
No, leave us.
You hired a hit man
to kill Josef Kostan.
No.
- Sir, we have evidence...
- I hired him to kill Charles Fitzgerald.
Who?
That was his name
when he took my daughter from me.
When he murdered her.
Sarah was 21
when that picture was taken.
That was 1955.
In a few months, she was gone.
You think Josef is responsible
for the death of your daughter?
I know what he is. He's a monster.
He took my daughter from me.
Well, you better tell me all about Josef
so I can find him before he finds you.
There, in that drawer.
Bring me that diary.
This was my Sarah's.
My wife kept it from me
until she died two years ago.
My daughter was a beautiful,
innocent, trusting young woman.
Her only mistake
was falling in love with Fitzgerald.
He exploited her love.
He seduced Sarah
and then he killed her.
I couldn't protect her then...
...but I can avenge her now.
So is that all in the diary?
Read for yourself.
So you hired someone to kill him.
It took me two years
to find Fitzgerald.
I can't die knowing that monster
still walks this earth.
You're gonna have to leave now.
Hey. Thank you.
Listen to this.
"It doesn't matter to me what he is.
I love him.
I want to be with him,
even though he tells me it's impossible.
I know our love
can overcome any obstacle.
I want him to turn me into what he is.
He says it's dangerous,
but I don't care.
I'm not afraid.
It's the only way
we can be together forever.
I'm ready."
That was the last entry.
So Josef never mentioned any of this?
Never told you about Sarah?
No.
I knew he lived here in New York
before he moved to Los Angeles.
Vamps move around.
We can't stay in one spot too long.
You have. You stayed in L.A.
- I like the weather.
- Really?
It's Sam. Hey, what did you find out?
Josef was picked up
at the terminal by an H&G limo.
-
- Okay, thanks.
- Can I help you?
- Yes, we're looking for Josef Kostan.
- No one by that name is here.
- Are you sure?
- A limo dropped him off at this address.
- I don't know what to tell you.
What about Charles Fitzgerald?
Do you know him?
It's okay, Paula. You can let them in.
- Well, you can run but you can't hide.
- Not from me, Charles.
So we had a pretty interesting talk
with John Whitley.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Mick, Beth...
...this is Sarah.
Sarah Whitley.
JOSEF: You can take your dinner break.
I'll watch her.
What's wrong with her?
She's been in a coma...
...since 1955.
BETH:
Oh, my God. She hasn't aged.
Yeah, I met her
at Grand Central Station.
We were both waiting for a train
and she asked me for a light.
And the moment I looked into her eyes,
I knew that she was something special.
I knew better than to get involved
with a human.
I know it was a mistake,
but I did it anyway.
Well, for months, I thought
I was keeping my secret from her.
But then I discovered that she knew.
She knew, and she didn't care.
That was the happiest day of my life.
BETH: So you were in love with her.
- I wasrt looking for it, believe me.
The longer we were together,
the more I began to think...
...that the whole reason
that I became a vampire was...
You know, so I could
live long enough to meet her.
You know, it took me
over 350 years to find her.
And only a year to lose her forever.
So, what happened to her?
He tried to turn her.
Yeah. She'd been begging me
to do it for months.
I didn't want to
but she wouldn't let it go.
Now, she knew that was the only way
we could be together.
So I tried.
I drained her and I fed her my blood,
but it didn't work.
She never came out of it.
She got lost somewhere in between.
MICK:
Josef.
This, all this...
...it's not your fault.
- I know, but it is.
I'm the one who did this to her.
You've been looking after her
ever since.
I couldn't let her go.
You know,
maybe someday medicine...
...a miracle,
something will bring her back.
Stay down, okay?
Die, vampire.
Why won't you die?
MICK:
It doesn't always work like that.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
What are you using back there,
barbecue tongs?
Will you hold still?
I'm trying to get the second bullet.
You know, for a 400-year-old vampire,
you sure have a low threshold for pain.
Well, giving is different than receiving.
MICK:
Done.
- How's your stake wound?
- Nothing a little blood wouldn't help.
MICK:
All these years, Josef.
You ranting about how it could
never work between us and humans.
Well, what happened to Sarah is
proof that I'm right.
MICK:
Josef Kostan in love?
That's proof that anything is possible.
Love can show you a part of yourself
you never knew existed.
Or a part that you thought
you lost forever.
And then this happened.
I guess the universe
had a different plan for me.
I guess who I am
is who I'm supposed to be.
You gonna try and make
your thing with Beth work?
Well, I hope the universe
is on your side.
- Are you okay?
- I will be.
That bastard staked me.
- Are you coming back to L.A. With us?
- I'm gonna stay here a few more days.
BETH:
You should have this.
She really loved you.
Hey. You all right?
Yeah.
I just can't stop thinking about Sarah.
She was so in love with him.
MICK:
Yeah, it's terrible.
Do you really think there's a cure?
Coraline made herself human.
Is that a cure? I don't know.
I can't say.
Taxi.
Come on, let's go do something.
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Something fun,
something quintessentially New York.
We'll catch a set
at the Village Vanguard. We'll...
A couple of martinis.
A steak for the lady.
Just you and me on the town.
Come on.
I don't know,
but our flight leaves in a couple hours.
So we'll take a later flight.
Look, I don't know.
I didn't leave things very well with Josh.
I do think I need to get home.
Yeah, of course.
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's okay. I'll walk.
It's a good town for it.
Okay.
Mick.
Code Blue.
Let's go.
