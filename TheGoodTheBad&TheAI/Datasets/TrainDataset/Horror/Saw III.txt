Daniel!
Secure the flank!
Left side clear?
We're clear!
Left side's clear.
Let's move!
Oh, my God.
Someone call Kerry.
The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.
The fire department was
the first on the scene.
Kerry.
Is it him?
- Before you go in there...
Eric. Is it him?
We don't know yet.
It's not
Detective Matthews.
What happened?
The victim was held
in place by these chains.
Mmhh!
Despite all of the
advantages and privileges
This was the bomb.
All he had to do was release
himself from each of the chains...
walk out the door
before it went off.
All he had to do?
Uhh!
Oh, God!
Fuck! Fuck! Oohh!
I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.
Kerry, Eric is
a missing persons case,
not a homicide case.
I've been having
nightmares where I see him.
I'm never going to be able to
forgive myself for what happened.
Listen, it's not your fault.
It's always
somebody's fault.
That somebody isn't you.
That someone
is still out there.
So put all your anger into
finding them and putting them away.
All right?
What I don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.
I'm not so sure
he did.
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.
Meaning?
Well...how'd
you get in here?
We cut the door down.
Why?
Because somebody heard
an explosion and
called us.
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?
It was welded shut.
Bloody truck
couldn't get in here.
Exactly.
I don't follow.
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was to
get out before the bomb went off,
then why was the door
welded shut?
The guy couldn't
get out if he wanted to.
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.
Aaahh!
You.
I gotta be
at the hospital by 9.
It's Tuesday. I thought
you started at 11.
Yeah, well, they change
things on me last minute.
Well, you better
head off, then.
You're not gonna
take a shower?
Nah. I'm just gonna take
a shower at the hospital.
Can we just...
talk for five minutes?
How about we just make eye
contact for five seconds?
What's wrong?
Nothing. Just...everything.
Lynn.
What is it you want
from me, Chris?
A divorce.
MPA.
Car skidded
into oncoming traffic.
Pressure?
Pulse is thready.
Ready? 1, 2, 3.
Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.
Set up an art-line.
Lynn!
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.
Get an OR ready.
We gotta crack his chest.
Do we get a bolus?
No.
What?
No air entry on the right side.
- And?
Let's get
a chest tube in him.
We gotta get him to OR now.
His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.
I'm doin' it.
I'm getting a rush of air.
Stats are improving.
Pressure back to 80.
Pressure normal.
If you got something on your mind,
just don't bring it in here.
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.
The woman standing in front
of me had to be dragged
from the locker room to put a
chest tube in a trauma patient?
Lynn Denlon should have
been the first one there.
Lynn.
Lynn!
What the hell?
I'm locked in!
Is anybody there?
Hello?
Anybody here?
Help! Help me!
Help!
Who are you?
Who are you?
What is this?
What are you doing?
- Shhh.
Are you gonna behave?
Let's go.
What is this place?!
What is this place?!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
What is...this place?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Hello, Dr. Denlon.
You may not remember me, but
I most certainly remember you.
I was a guest
at your hospital once.
Where am I?
Do you remember me?
I've seen you on television.
Lawrence Gordon
was your doctor.
I was his patient,
and he was mine.
As you can see
from that report,
my prognosis
isn't good.
Would you agree?
There's no preventative
treatment for what you have.
I remember you saying
that to me once before
in almost the exact
same tone.
Leave it to a doctor to find
such a cold, clinical way
of saying I'm
a dead man walking.
Looking at me, how long
would you say I have left?
I'd have to examine you.
Even then, a frontal lobe
tumor is unpredictable.
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis--
I'm sorry, but there's all this
crude medical equipment around me
causing you to believe that
you're still inside a hospital.
No.
- Then why are you speaking to me
in that graduate school
medical jargon?
Look at me!
Aaahh! Aah! Uhh!
Now, you look at me.
I asked you
a simple question.
Based on your experience,
how long do you
think I have left?
It's not a simple answer.
Based on your file,
I'd say...not long.
Death is a surprise party.
Unless, of course...you're
already dead on the inside.
Unless you're
the type of person
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?
Turns their back
on their husband.
Neglects their child.
Who has every possible
advantage in life
but chooses not to advance.
What do you want from me?
What do I want?
I want to play a game.
The rules of the game
are simple.
The consequences for
breaking them are great.
Death.
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.
Your will to keep
someone alive.
Can you do that?
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?
- What is this?
No! Get it--aah!
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing
to me?
Aah! Aah!
The device that you're wearing is
linked to my heart rate monitor.
The second that heart
rate monitor flatlines
or you move out of range,
an explosion will
go off in that collar.
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.
Please. Please don't
do this to me.
I have a family.
I have a family.
Let me give you
the simple version.
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.
No excuses.
No equivocations.
No crying.
What do you mean,
keep him alive?
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.
A man.
He will face
a series of tests.
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.
If he completes
all of his tests
and John is still breathing,
then I will
remove your collar...
...and you're
free to go.
Uhh!
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.
A critical part of what
could be my final test.
Amanda, it's time
to start our game.
Help!
Hello!
Is there anybody out there?
Over the past few years, you have
become a shell of your former self...
Vengeance against the drunk
driver who killed your only son.
To escape from where you are, you will
have to face a series of tests.
You will have to suffer to move
forward through each of them.
You fucking killed my son.
Don't you fuckin' beg.
Do you know who I am?
I'll fuckin' teach you,
you motherfucker.
This is what
you fuckin' deserve.
Where is it?
What?
Where is it?
How many times?
How many times
do I have to tell you
before you get it
in your head?
I just wanted
to sleep with something.
No. No. You just--nothin'.
You don't...touch things
in Dylan's room.
Okay?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
You know I love you,
don't you?
Mm-hmm.
What do you think Mommy would
say if she saw us like this?
I'm gonna go
get ready for school.
Unh.
Hello?
Hello?
Hey!
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.
Right here.
Look at my nose, please?
Follow my flashlight.
Tell me if you feel
any pain, all right?
That hurt?
It's begun.
He's out of the box.
So?
My 20-second analysis
without any medical equipment
is that his
brain's herniating.
Oh.
He needs to go to the
hospital and have an operation
to decompress his brain.
Come here.
No, really. Come here.
- What?
Come here.
- No.
Did I bring John
to you...
or did I bring your
self-centered ass to him?
You better start
fuckin' paying attention.
No one's going
to any hospital.
I can't perform miracles.
You're--You're giving
him painkillers.
For a tumor like this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.
Oh, good. Yeah.
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,
you know,
like Dexamethasone.
Why don't you fuckin' tell me
something that I don't know,
you stupid cunt?
The only place that he can get
those drugs is in a hospital.
Or else he's gonna die.
You are not
a good listener.
I think you missed the part
that if  dies...
die.
I'm not asking you. He is.
He chose you.
Not me.
- Amanda!
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her
if you're threatening her.
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.
You need to abide
by those rules.
Sorry.
Amanda! Amanda,
I need your help!
Amanda, he needs oxygen!
Oxygen, Amanda!
Put the mask on his face.
Okay, now hold him down.
Tip his head to the side.
You got it?
What are you doing?!
Ativan!
Do you have Ativan?!
No!
Back off! Back off!
Back off! Back off!
Stay with me, John.
You're almost through this. Stay with me.
Stay with me.
We're almost done with this.
Was that enough for you?
Are you ready to go
to the hospital now?
He needs to have
an operation.
Okay.
Okay.
But we do it here.
We do it here.
- What?
What do you need?
I need anesthetic for
a procedure like this.
Anesthetic.
What else?
Even with an anesthetic--
Anesthetic!
What else?
A power drill.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Please, please.
Let me go.
Please. Why...Why are you
doing this to me?
Don't...Don't kill me.
Okay? Please!
Wait. The key. Key.
Key. Okay.
Come on.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Please. I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms.
Help me.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything to you!
That's exactly it.
You didn't do anything.
I'm fucking...dying.
He died!
In my arms.
My eight-year-old son
died in my arms.
I made a m-m-mistake.
I'm so sorry.
I'm human.
I'm human, just like
your son was. Okay?
Look at me.
I said, look at me.
Look....
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's--It's cold.
Ohhh!
Fuck you!
Oh, God.
Aaahh!
Amanda, if you really
care about John,
you won't let me
do this to him.
I mean, you're
a smart woman,
and you know
what's right for him.
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard
to concentrate
when you're surrounded by so many
things you could kill me with,
like this ax
I saw you lookin' at.
Take it.
Please, it's yours.
Come on.
I'd go for the neck,
but I'm not
the brain surgeon.
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,
rip off his heart rate monitor.
- Boom.
Then you just have to find
the sensor and disarm it
so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door
without the collar
detonating.
Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.
But that
could be tricky.
The slightest knock
in the wrong place
could trigger it.
I should know.
I built it.
So. Do you have
everything you need?
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.
I don't have the tools
to save a life.
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.
Most people are so
ungrateful to be alive,
Amanda,
do not be afraid.
He made it through
the freezer room.
He tried to save her.
There are some things
I need you to do for me.
In my desk...
in the center drawer,
an envelope...
with your name on it.
She's gonna do
a procedure on you.
Yeah.
To relieve the
pressure on your brain.
Yeah.
And help with
the headaches.
I can't do this.
Amanda...you can.
You can.
You're stronger now.
And I believe in you.
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?
That's one reason
I chose her.
Hello?
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
I'm in here!
Please get me
out of here.
Help me. I--
Hello?
I know you're there.
Please!
Please help me!
I--I can hear you.
Please, answer me!
Help me!
Please!
Help me.
Get me out of here, please.
Please help me.
Get me out of here!
Please!
Don't just stand there!
Help me!
Now you have the power to sentence
his soul straight to Hell.
The key that will free him is hidden
inside your son's possessions--
Now, if you flip the switch on
the incinerator underneath you,
Please,
get me out of here.
Please!
What is that?
What's that sound?
What are you doing?
I'm a criminal court judge,
for Christ's sake!
You can't do this to me!
You don't remember me?
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?
He was the driver
who killed my son.
You gave him six months!
Okay. All right.
We can talk
about your case.
Obviously you want answers.
I can't give them
to you like this.
This hurts!
You gave more for
fuckin' parking tickets!
Listen to me.
I can see that you are in
a great deal of pain,
but there are ways that we
can have his sentence extended.
I can help you!
It's too late!
They let him go!
Don't become what he is!
Don't become a killer!
Please!
I never hurt you.
Where are you going?
You gotta help me!
I'm so sorry!
Oh, God.
You're killing me!
Don't do this to me!
I'm gonna die!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you--
You gotta help me!
Shut the fuck up.
Help!
Come on!
He made it through
the second test.
The judge is alive.
Faster than I expected.
All right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side
and keep still.
What's goin' on here
is that your brain
is pushing
against your skull.
I'm gonna try
to relieve the pressure
by cutting away
a little bit of your skull.
It should help you
with your headaches
and drastically improve
your motor skills.
Do you understand?
All too well.
All right, you're gonna
feel some slight discomfort.
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?
For a procedure like this,
the patient needs to be
fully alert.
Amanda, I need you here.
Amanda.
All right, John, you're
gonna feel some pressure.
Let's clamp this.
Stop the bleeding.
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.
Hurry.
All right, John, I need you
to keep your mouth closed.
You're gonna hear
a lot of noise.
John, how you doin'?
Never better.
Okay.
All right, you're gonna
hear a lot of ringing.
I need you to stay
very still.
Here I go.
All right, John,
I'm gonna remove the skull.
Ohh...
He's stabilized.
John, I need you
to raise your hand
and flex your fingers.
John?
John, raise your hand... hand...
John, can you hear me?
What's happening?
John.
What's happening to him?
What's happening?
What's wrong?
Why isn't he moving?
Do something!
Please.
Stay with me, John.
Good.
I love you.
- I love you.
Breathe!
Breathe, damn it.
Breathe, John.
I love...
Breathe.
I...
I love you.
You will give
everything to me.
Every cell in your body.
Is that understood?
Yes.
The marks on your arms...
they're from another life.
We'll leave
that life behind.
When you go down
that corridor...
...there is no turning back.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
Then start with this.
Go.
Put his left leg
in the shackle.
It's time to start
our game.
What's that?
Slow my heart rate.
Relax my muscles.
It's time.
Close the door
behind you.
He can't hear you.
He doesn't even
know you're there.
Amanda.
Put...it...away.
Trust me.
Uhh! Uhh...
Put it away.
Uhh!
Leave us alone.
Now.
You fucking freak.
I apologize for her behavior.
She swims in  sea.
In the end,
she will be the closest
I've ever come
to a connection,
to being understood.
But her emotion
is also her...weakness.
Adam.
Adam.
Come here.
I'm gonna
help you.
Gonna help you.
I'm gonna free you.
Adam!
I'm so sorry
about your son, Jeff.
But let me tell you
something that I...
that I know for sure.
No sentence I gave him,
not 500 years,
not even death, nothing,
will take your pain away.
And vengeance doesn't
solve anything.
It only makes
the pain greater, Jeff.
What the...
What the fuck?
Somebody, help me!
What the fuck?
Help.
What the fu--
What the fuck are you doin'?!
Please help me.
that means that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of
Do something!
a medical student with
a mother and a father
There is a chance he might live,
though, with your help.
Please...
Have mercy!
...to take a bullet for the
man who killed your son?
Does "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"
My God.
My God.
You've got to help him, Jeff!
Fuck me!
Please stop! Stop!
Stop!
Please, stop!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Just standing there you're
an accomplice to murder!
Are you a murderer?
I've wanted
to kill him every day.
Oh, my God!
For three years,
I wanted to kill you.
Yes, maybe I am.
You'll lose your family.
Oh, my God!
Your wife, your daughter.
I killed him.
Fuck!
Oh, God.
Okay.
Hold on, son.
Hold on.
Don't give up.
Come on, son.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Son.
I got the key.
Uhh! Uhh...
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Stop!
I forgive him!
I forgive him! No!
No!
God!
God damn you!
Don't you think
it would be wise
to engage me
in conversation
for your own sake?
I asked you to tell me
about your husband.
It's like
we're strangers now.
And?
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.
But now...
...I'd give...
anything in the world...
...to see my husband.
Matrimony's always
fascinated me.
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives,
wives on their backs
in motel rooms
with perfect strangers,
people who bear children
only to neglect them.
Till death do us part,
indeed.
I don't know
what you think you know,
but my marriage has
survived more suffering
than someone like you
could ever grasp.
Suffering?
You haven't seen
anything yet.
Someone like me?
Who am I?
A monster.
A murderer.
I don't condone murder,
and I...
despise murderers.
Please.
Please...let me go.
We're fine, Amanda.
We don't need you.
I said, we're fine.
If you make it through this, Lynn,
you're gonna thank me one
day just as Amanda did.
I saved your life.
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.
Tell me about your daughter.
I understand she's quite
a little athlete.
Or we could talk about your son.
What did you say?
Why are you living
with the dead
when you have such
a beautiful family,
who looks them in the eye
and treats them
like human beings?
He's completed
the third test.
Congratulations, Lynn.
You're free to go.
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.
No, he's not finished.
He's not all the way.
Amanda, Lynn is more
important than you know.
Unlock her collar
and let her go.
I said no.
Amanda, there are rules.
She doesn't deserve
to go free.
You promised.
I didn't promise you shit.
Amanda, even with that gun,
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hand.
Fuck you.
You give her control over me?
Fuck you!
I won't tell anyone.
I promise I won't.
Please, I have a family.
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!
And stop fuckin'
moving around!
What about the other test
subjects that we left alive?
Game over.
- I'll fuckin' kill you!
What about them?
Was that how you felt
about them?
Eric Matthews.
Let me go.
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.
Daniel!
Fuck.
Fuck!
- Damn you!
Daniel!
Fuck!
Fuck.
Aaaahhh!
Where's Daniel?
Where's my son?
Where is he,
you junkie bitch?
Fuck you.
Where is he?!
Tell me where he is.
Tell me where he is.
Right fuckin' here.
You bitch!
You're nothin', bitch!
You're nothing!
You're not Jigsaw.
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!
You hear me?
You're nothing!
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.
You're nothin'!
I'll fuckin' kill you!
No!
That's right.
I'm a murderer.
He took my life from me,
so I just returned
the fuckin' favor.
No, Amanda, that's
what you thought, but I know
different.
You left him for dead,
didn't you?
Stop fucking with me.
But I cleaned up
your mistakes.
I forgave you for them.
Let me go! Please!
But now you're begging me not
to kill this worthless bitch
on the grounds
of some game?
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.
Step back.
It's bullshit.
If you fail in this,
we all fail.
Succeed,
and we all succeed.
It's a lie!
I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,
because nobody
fuckin' changes.
Nobody is reborn.
It's all bullshit!
It's all a fuckin' lie!
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.
I don't mean
anything to you.
No, you mean
everything to me.
Fuck you!
Our fates are linked.
I've tried
to help you, Amanda.
So, help me!
Fix me!
Fix me, motherfucker!
I'm standin' right here.
Why is she so important to you?
She's not important to me.
She's important to
She's not important to me.
I beg you
to reconsider that.
This is your
last chance, Amanda.
She's nothing.
Your time's running out.
Now, you think about
what you're doing.
You think about
what you promised me.
Think about tomorrow.
Lynn?
Jeff! Jeff--
Lynn.
Lynn.
Lynn.
- Jeff.
You just destroyed
four lives.
You just murdered
Jeff's wife.
Unhh! Unhh!
Baby.
Amanda.
It's okay.
This was  test...
...your game.
What do I want?
I want to play a game.
You're being tested.
Your will
is being tested--
someone alive.
Can you do that?
and grant someone
the gift of life?
I was testing you.
I took you in.
You will give
everything to me.
Yes.
That's right.
I'm a murderer.
I despise murderers.
You didn't test
anyone's will to live.
Game over.
There is no turning back.
Do you understand that?
In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance.
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?
That's one reason
I chose her.
You didn't know that
Lynn and Jeff were husband and wife.
I wanted you to succeed.
Amanda, put it away.
Trust me,
even with that gun,
it's Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.
She's not
important to me.
Unlock her collar
and let her go.
I said no!
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.
We need to abide
by those rules.
You couldn't.
God.
Game over.
You haven't learned
anything tonight, have you?
Your rage
and your vengeance
will only hurt
the ones you love.
Killing me will only add
to your misery.
It will not bring back
your son.
Think of your daughter,
Jeff.
She needs you now
more than ever.
You can't kill me, Jeff.
Your wife's dying, Jeff.
Her time's running out.
Jeff, do not miscalculate.
Your fate is in my hands.
Your wife's fate
is in my hands.
I love you.
I love you.
I'm taking you home. Okay?
Though you may not
see any threat...
there are threats
all around you.
Jeff, if you try to move
your wife, she will die.
I can have an ambulance
here in four minutes.
Would you like to take your
wife out of here tonight?
Would you like
to take her to safety?
Stay.
Stand and face me, Jeff.
Stay with me, please.
- Right now.
Would you like to get
your life back?
Would you, Jeff?
I can make that happen.
Which is it, Jeff?
Come on...yes or no?
Yes.
What do you want?
One final test.
The rules are simple.
Over on that table, there's
a host of vicious implements...
...which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,
to take your vengeance,
to indulge your obsession.
Or you can choose to put
your vengeance aside,
and you can forgive.
You can forgive me
for the pain
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.
Jeff.
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?
Honey, don't do it.
