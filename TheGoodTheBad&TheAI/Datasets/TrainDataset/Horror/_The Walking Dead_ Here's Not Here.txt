Narrator: Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead
Morgan: I was suppose
to kill my wife.
Morgan :
But I couldn't do it.
Morgan: And then she
was just on him.
Rick: Do you think he's crazy?
Michonne: No, I think
he's dangerous.
Why?
Because all life is precious.
Spencer : Some
group got inside the walls.
Spencer :
They're killing people.
Morgan:
Carol!
You don't have to kill.
Carol:
Of course we do.
I'm not very good with guns.
Me neither.
You said you liked talking.
I remember that.
"Little chats with a stranger
by the fire."
You said it was like the movies.
Then you said that you want
everything that I have.
Every last bit.
Well, here it is.
Every last bit.
Morgan:
You don't.
You don't.
or how much time.
We weren't supposed to be there.
You had the knife.
You were supposed to.
You know you were supposed to.
You know.
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No! I'm sorry.
You don't.
You don't.
You don't!
You know you don't!
You're still the same.
You're-- you're
still doing it.
You know what it is.
You know what it is.
Man: Can you step
away from the goat?
Why don't you put the gun
down and we'll talk?
Sorry.
What's your name?
Kill me.
Well, that's a stupid name.
It's dangerous.
You should change it.
Kill me.
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me.
My name's Eastman.
-
- Eastman:
- Eastman:
-
It's yours.
Take it.
You know what it is.
You shot at me.
I fed you.
Please don't hurt her.
Good night.
-
- Shh. Shh.
Oh!
Oh, that is--
oh, that's terrible!
That-- oh, God,
that is--
that is terrible.
I just wanted to wait a little
while before we talked.
I'm from Atlanta.
I'm a forensic psychiatrist.
The state employed me
to determine
if certain people who did very
bad things would do them again
if they were released
from prison.
That was my job.
Now I live here.
Because of the state
of the state
and the whole world.
What did you do
or what do you do now?
I clear.
What the hell does that mean?
anything that gets
anywhere near me,
I kill 'em.
I clear.
Why?
Because that's why
I'm still here.
Well...
that's the biggest load
of horseshit I ever heard.
It's PTSD.
You see that blood
on the end of my stick?
At the sharp end?
He just fell to the ground
with it stuck in him
trying to breathe
through the blood.
Other one I strangled.
No rope, just my hands.
That was the day
before I came here.
Maybe--
maybe the same day.
I-- I don't know.
But that's what I did.
That's what I do.
You killed a lot of people?
They were threatening
you, attacking you?
Not all of them.
You saved people.
Pointless acts.
Everybody turns.
I saw a wedding ring.
You had someone
you loved, didn't you?
Children?
Oh.
You loved them.
You loved them a lot
if you're like this.
You saw it happen.
It's all happening right in front
of your eyes over and over.
but your mind is still there.
There's a door and you
want to go through it
to get away from it, so you do
and it leads you
right back to that moment.
And you see that door again
and you know it won't work,
but, hell, maybe it'll work.
So you step through that door
and you're right back in that
horrible moment every time.
So you just want to stop
opening that door.
So you just sit in it.
But I assure you,
one of those doors
leads out, my friend.
I don't have any friends.
Get to know me.
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
-
- Because I have to clear.
We're not built to kill.
We don't have claws
or fangs or armor.
Vets that came back with PTSD,
that didn't happen because we're
comfortable with killing.
You know, I've interviewed
over 825 people
who've done terrible things.
I've only met one evil person.
Some of them were born
with bad brains.
Traumatized themselves like
you, but they could heal.
Some more, some less,
but they can.
We all can.
I know it.
It's all a circle and
everything gets a return.
The door is open.
That door right there.
The cell door, it's open.
I can't stop you.
Go, clear.
Or stay, crash on the couch,
You stay or you go.
Those are the choices.
I will not allow you to kill me.
I will not allow that.
Eastman:
- Stop.
-
I gave you two choices.
Oh, shit.
Kill me.
I gave you two choices.
That was aikido.
That's how I kicked
your ass earlier.
Well, that's how
I redirected your ass.
The people in prison
I evaluated for the state,
the stories I heard,
the things these people did.
One night, my
five-year-old daughter
found me crying in the garage
after about eight beers.
Told her I wasn't
feeling too good.
She gave me this.
She had won it at a carnival
at school that day.
She said it'd make me lucky
and I'd feel better.
The next morning I found
a flyer for aikido.
Damn thing worked.
Your wife and your daughter...
they're dead.
It was aikido.
It'll help.
And you obviously need help
if we're gonna make this trip.
Can't just be
me and you to the end.
A trip where?
I have no idea.
Good night.
Grassy notes are a
little too Astroturf,
but there's potential here.
There is always potential.
Where there's life,
there's potential.
I've been a vegetarian
for a while now.
I was afraid that damn goat
was gonna make me a vegan.
I don't kill, but I'm not giving
up on chocolate any time soon.
You might notice I'm not giving
up on the Goo Goo Clusters.
They're gonna
remain on the menu.
You should try one.
They're good.
Come on, you're alive.
Live a little.
We should go out.
We got a lot here,
but we should scavenge
some things up for the trip.
You coming?
Can you do that for me?
-
-
-
-
-
-
Well, you maimed a tomato plant,
but it looks to me like you
saved a goat today, my friend.
Hey.
Thank you.
Progress.
Just a second.
A and B.
A-- you broke
the garden fence,
laid waste to a perfectly
good tomato plant.
You got to fix it.
Fixed your spear.
Eastman:
Morgan:
Eastman: And actually caring about
the welfare of your opponent.
Morgan: So you have to
care about yourself.
Eastman: You have to believe
your life is precious,
Morgan: You have to
redirect those thoughts,
Eastman: What we've
done, we've done.
Morgan: We evade it
by moving forward
Eastman:
Morgan: To still
accept what we were.
Hey.
Eastman:
Morgan:
Eastman: And in doing
that, protect yourself.
Morgan:
Why do you have a cell
in your cabin?
It didn't have a cell back then.
That was just the other side
of the living room.
In my job I interviewed
over 800 men and 25 women
convicted of awful things.
Stuff from the darkest part
of the human soul.
I was evaluating a man
by the name
of Crighton Dallas Wilton.
Name like that, sounded like
he should own an oil company
and wear a big hat--
Crighton Dallas Wilton.
Despite doing some truly unspeakable
acts, he was up for parole.
And he was one of the most damn
likable people I had ever met.
He said all the right
things, he went to therapy.
He wrote letters to the prison
board to start a program
to grow flowers
for the waiting rooms
in state hospitals, rest homes.
And I saw right through him.
Saw that he was
a true psychopath,
that he knew how to play people,
exactly how to play people.
I was interviewing him
next to the cafeteria.
The place smelled
of industrial pizza.
They were polishing the floor.
I had to shout my
questions half the time.
And there was this moment.
Can't even remember
the exchange.
But right then I knew
that Crighton knew that I
knew exactly what he was.
Everything he had said,
done to hide away
what he was from
everyone, from himself,
just slipped away, and...
and that model prisoner
of 10 years stood up,
smiled,
and just cracked me
across the face.
His fist felt like a rock.
Then he was on top of me and
the floor polisher next door
was thudding out every sound.
And I--
and I saw his face,
his-- his eyes,
his evil.
Mask had slipped.
And he was gonna kill me
right then and there
because he knew I would make sure
he would never get out again.
Arm bar counter
for being choked
from a pinned position.
Aikido.
I wasn't taking it
for self-defense,
but it saved my life.
And I got to make sure
he never got out again.
Well, got to try.
He got out.
Talked to the right people
who got him the right things
and he broke out,
but it wasn't to escape.
Crighton Dallas Wilton
went to my home
and killed my wife,
my daughter, and my son.
He walked down the street
to the police station
around the corner
covered in their blood.
He surrendered.
Said the only reason
he broke out
was to destroy my life.
A year passed...
and he was still working
those plots.
They just let him
work those plots
by the roads out by 85,
grow chrysanthemums,
forget-me-nots.
I built that cell
with the full intention
of bringing
Crighton Dallas Wilton here,
putting him behind those bars and
watching him starve to death.
And did you?
I have come to believe
that all life is precious.
Even for a man like that?
Who did that to you?
To your family?
I have come to believe
that all life is precious.
That's why we're having
oatmeal burgers.
You're good at it.
Redirecting.
We need more gear.
Tarp, crowbar.
I'm thinking we could try for
the islands off the coast.
I think people
could have gone there.
Hell, at the very least,
we could see the beach.
What is it?
I know where we can
find all that.
Who did you lose?
My wife and son.
Who you lost.
Their names.
Jenny and Duane.
I'm sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.
Forms, right now.
Not here.
Right now.
You're gonna hold a baby again.
It's all yours.
Damn it, move!
Ow!
I said not here.
That wasn't for you to do.
How could you do that?
That wasn't for you to do!
You can't just--
you can't just step in!
Tell me how it is.
Tell me how it is!
Tell me!
Let's go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're coming back.
You are done with this.
You made it out.
Ow!
Kill me.
Kill me!
I said not here.
Well, that's the thing, Morgan.
Here's not here.
No.
Thank you.
Oh, she got out.
She figured out
the door was open, too.
I didn't figure it out.
You had to tell me.
Glad you're back.
Here.
Come on, you sit down
before you fall down.
Eastman:
let him work
the plots beside 85.
Even after what he did.
They let him because
he was so damn charming.
I found out
the schedule, waited,
made sure the right
people were working.
I got him in my car quick
and brought him back here.
If they'd have caught me,
it'd have been fine.
It'd have been better.
But I got him here and they
didn't know where to look.
You gotta sit down.
All right.
I'm okay.
I put him in that cell...
and I let him starve to death.
It took 47 days.
And then I was gone.
I was where you were.
And I wasn't trying to open
up the door anymore either.
What I did to him,
it didn't give me any peace.
I found my peace
when I decided
to never kill again.
To never kill anything again.
When I decided to settle things,
I went back to Atlanta
to turn myself in.
That's how I found out
the world ended.
But the world hasn't ended.
Progress.
My daughter drew this on the
hallway wall of our house.
She thought I'd get mad.
I just put a frame around it.
After I went back, when I found
out I couldn't turn myself in
because there was no one
to turn myself in to,
I went back home
to cut this from the wall.
I lost the car on the way back.
I walked through
for a piece of drywall.
Scariest thing I ever did.
Best thing I ever did.
You can stay here.
You have enough food,
power, security.
For the rest of your life,
you could stay here.
But you shouldn't stay here.
Can't expect such a splendid
guest as yourself to show up.
You stay here, you'll be alone.
You were alone.
Everything is about people.
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.
It couldn't be just me.
It shouldn't be just you.
Hell, Tabitha's gone now.
I'm ready.
I have a gun in
the lockbox out there.
Here.
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Hope it's lucky for you, too,
whatever you decide.
I've decided.
And that's it.
Every last bit.
You think it can work out
that way with me?
Yes.
I think it can.
Maybe.
You noticed
I'm shaking a little?
Sweating a little?
Oh, man.
in the pictures I found.
I thought maybe there'd
be something here.
Medicine to help this.
But that was before
you people won.
So I know I'm probably
going to die.
But if I don't...
I am going to have
to kill you, Morgan.
Just like your friend
Eastman's children.
Those are the rules.
but you said it, right?
Don't ever be sorry.
