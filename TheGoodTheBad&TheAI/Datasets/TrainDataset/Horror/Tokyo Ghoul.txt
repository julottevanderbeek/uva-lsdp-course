Episode 13
Seems like everything was stolen,
including money in safe-box and jewelry.
{Well, everything stolen, including money in safe-box and jewelry.}
And also...
... all the victims don't have an identity.
We need to find the culprit at any cost.
{Whatever happens, we have to find the culprit.}
And restore the good name of CCG.
{And to restore the good name of CCG.}
Tch!
Annoying!
{}
So, this formula can be used{entered} here,
and then here.
And the result...
Fura, what time do you think it is
right now?{Fura, what time do you think now?}
Sasada Aki, Is he not going to come
today too?{Sasada Aki, today he did not get in again?}
I don't know.
whatever.
Hey, Taishi.
You should continue
playing Baseball.{Should you continue playing baseball.}
You love to play baseball, right?
Aki...
You don't have a book, do you?
{Did you forget your notes today?..Today, you do not carry a note, right?}
Arima, huh?
It's your book.
Don't worry, I remember everything.
{Don't worry, I remember all the lessons in my head.}
Take it.
Don't need it.
Why?
Fura, you rarely come to school.
You don't seem like a guy who can
study well.{You also can not seem to understand the lesson.}
I think you could use a book.
What do you want, bastard ?!
Fura!
Get out! You're disturbing the
other model students.
Who am I kidding, I'm not
decent at studying.
Catch it! Catch it!
If I had continued playing baseball.
Would I have been any different?{Will there be a little different?}
Bikers ahead, stop!
We will not stop, you idiot!
Aki, hold it right!
Aki ?!
Those guys, driving at that dangerous speed.
{Aki?That is dangerous driving....He was, as it was dangerous speeding.}
Wanna play tricks on them again?{Later plays tricks them again, yok!}
Ryou, Aki, what do you want?
Soda.
You guys are alike.
Okay then, the Loser pays.
Oye, wait for me, shit!
-
Aki, how is Taishi doing lately?{Aki, what is often done by the Taishi lately?}
I don't know.
I don't know. But he is attending
the school regularly.
Woah, He didn't went to school even after leaving the
baseball.{Wow! After stopping playing baseball he gets messed up, right?}
I think he has a girlfriend.{He gets the girl he liked did not, huh?}
Huh?
He pisses me off.
He quit baseball, left the team.
He's  the worst.
He is{was} indeed so, yes...?
Even now!
If all three of us were together,...{And once, the three of us were always together.}
Won't it solve everything?{Do all the things that it will not come back?}
Of course that won't work.{Certainly will not be back, right?}
You're right.
Disgusting.
Here.
Oh.
What happened?
No, it's nothing.
Huh?
What th-{Why, heck {\ fscx250}
Don't!{Do!}
Geez, they are slow like old folks.{Geez, they are really old, anyway.}
Huh?
Oye!
You're way too late.{You're a long time, anyway!}
Who... are you?
Ghoul
Oye, you guys...?!
Run!
Come on run, hurry.{A quick run, come on!}
Are you being chased again-?{You chased by police lag }
No!
He is more dangerous!
Taishi!
Asshole!
Who the hell is wearing
a strange mask like that!
You don't know the blow
of a baseball player, huh ?!
Pumpkin Head bitch!
I will kill you!{Will I consumed you!}
Stop it, Taishi!
Leave it and run!
Wa-Wat ?!
What... the...hell?
Aki!
Ryou...
We should... still... play baseball...someday.
I...
Ryou...!
... Sorry.
Ryou...
Asshole!
Fura!
You could die.
Arima...?
Back off!
If you run, then I can't win.{Escaping feeling can not win, huh?}
Quick! Carry the body!
Can I talk to you for a minute?
CCG...?
So Arima, have you been dealing with horrible things like that...?
Bye, Fura. I'll see you later at school.
He seems like he has finished
doing some club activities,...
Returning so casually...
Aki...
Ryou...
There's no way I can accept this...!
Yo!
Hey, what do you know about that monster?
Hurry Up! Tell me!
They are called .
?
They have the same form as humans.
They can blend with people.
They are inhumane.
Mutant man-eaters.
That is.
Arima, If you're going to hunt down that pumpkin head,
I'll lend a hand.{Arima, if you're going to hunt down that Pumpkin Head, I'll help.}
It's alright, but, don't be a burden.{It's okay, just do not be a burden.}
Bastard!
I...
... Couldn't do anything in my power.
I had no choice {Can not do anything,
so I had no choice!}
But I'll have my revenge!
No matter what you say, I will do it!
I understand.
What if I bring a bat?
If they use weapons,
it {all} would be pointless though.
...are they that dangerous?
Of course.
Especially now already 10 days have passed...
True enough, right?
It's almost time for the next meal.
What an idiot, to pass through this dangerous path.
You look as if you are saying "".
Arima!
She's fine, just unconscious.{He does nothing, just asleep.}
How do you know
about her condition!?{Why you know her condition ?!}
Fura, be careful.
He is...
...terribly strong.
He is ready to attack.
Shit! Asshole
What the fuck are you doing!?{What are you doing, Fuck ?!}
Be kicked by me or be torned by him?
Which one do you choose?
Regular weapon won't be impervious to .
But then how...
... Can you win against a?
It's time to use .
That...
What? why does this brat..
How could a boy like you...
... have weapons of a Ghoul Investigator.
It's easy...
Because I was a Ghoul Investigator.
Boy like you... an Investigator...
Impossible...
Arima...?
Yes, As I thought, he was strong.{Yes, I knew he was kind of strong.}
Arima.
I told you this is a secret investigation.
You are not allowed to act independently.
Marude-san....
But, it was to destroy the.
Don't just assume things on your own.{Do not assume good as jidatmu!}
If you die, it would be
a problem for me!{If later you die, just know the taste!}
In addition, both of them are also
involved in the case now.{In addition, they both also involved with the case at that time.}
Both of them?{They both?}
Post-traumatic stress, you know about it, right?
Yes...
What do you want to talk about?
Fura, I will be {out}leaving school.
Huh?
You and Minami already know my identity.
This secret investigation has no meaning anymore.
What do you mean by that...?!
I was always moving residence to hunt .
It's been a while since I've spoken
to someone of my age.
Normal school life is pleasant.
Thank you.
Just what kind of life is that ?!
But, nobody knows about you, right?
Because I would never disclose
it to anyone, definitely!
{Because I certainly would not deploy identity it to anyone!}
Just stay for a little while.
Well, if you want me to stay a little while longer.
Really?
Yes.
In addition, there are things we must do.
.
I really wanted to destroy it.
You also want to avenge your friend, don't you?
{Do you also want to avenge your friend, is not it?}
So help me too, Taishi.
Of course!
You would become a nice bait.{You will be nice to become the bait.}
You didn't need to
put it like that.{No need to explain that too, dong.}
I also...
I also want to help.
Aki.
Yo.
You're here again.{Again you here.}
Is it bad, huh?{Not to be, huh?}
If a yankee like you come here,
I would be considered one of them too.
Stupid, what are you saying.{Stupid, where there is!}
What are you doing?
I'm just looking at the scenery outside.
Oh really?
But, I can't see anything
from my right eye.{But yes, my right eye doesn't feel anything.}
I can't even tell which way I'm looking...
Perhaps this is my punishment...
...for doing stupid things at my will.
That's why...
...I've lost my right eye and Ryou too.
Everything was taken away from me.
God might Just hate me.
Since then...
... I, Arima and Minami,
the three of us started hunting.
And we managed to hunt down
and eliminate 10 ghouls.
Minami as a planner.
As I became a bait,
Arima executed them.{And Arima be executioner.}
We... thought a little,
but we are a good team.
But...
... Until now we have not managed to
hunt down the .
Here you are.{Here, yes!}
Perhaps this is just the result of Inquiry in school,
But I got a rumor that has to do with a ghoul.
So, here are all the details.
Woah, that's awesome!{Well, great!}
As expected of class president.{Class President, steady!}
It's about a suspicious person who always looks at the construction site,
Rumors are most likely to be correct.{Rumors
it is most likely correct.}
I have marked the location
I suspect, let's look at it.
Yea! Thanks!
Great! let's investigate
the factory!{Great! Let's get started then!}
Thank you for the information.
Next, let me and Taishi do it.
You don't need to come.
{Next, let me and Taishi who do it, you do not need to participate.}
Oye Arima, don't say that.
Umm...
I'm still no good, huh?{Not to be, huh?}
If I'm allowed, I'll help
with whatever I can.{If allowed I want to help you whatever it is.}
It's no good. If you come,
the risk would be higher.{Not allowed. If you come,
the risk will be higher.}
Taishi, we'll go to the plant site after school.
{Taishi, home from school later we are going to the plant site.}
Be prepared.
Y-Yeah...
Your information is really awesome.
{Information  really very helpful, you know!}
Really?
Yes...
Thank goodness.
Uh, Fura-kun.
Arima-kun has changed, haven't he?
Yes, you're right. His name is also changed.
Arima Kishou....
Just like a .
He's just like his name. He came to rescue me at the crucial time.
{Pas really with his name, because he came to the rescue at the crucial moment.}
Oh Minami, we have to go back to the class.
I want to be here for a while.
I see.
Yes.
Thanks for the notes.
I'll return them soon.{Thanks to his notes, soon I return!}
I was useful...{I guess it's about time...}
What Minami said is true.{What is said Minami true.}
There was a ghoul
in this factory.
Hey, Arima.
Don't you think you're a bit cold
to Minami?{Bu-Are not you a bit too cold to Minami?}
It's okay, isn't it?
Minami wouldn't mind it.
Pumpkin Head, It's rare to see
you hanging out here.
It seems that Ghoul Investigator
is investigating this area,
Pumpkin Head.
I already know about the .
Well, it's because you people
at random,right?
They consist of 3 high school students.
High School Students?
One of them is not an ordinary boy.{They are not ordinary boy.}
If you make haste, you'll be killed.{If you hasty surely be killed.}
He's nothing more than a child who was playing with his toy.
{They are nothing more than a child who was playing his toy.}
That boy would be a great toy
to play with.{That boy is a great play toy.}
So you called me, just to
talk about something like this?
One great enemy has emerged.
We share a common enemy.
Let's make a truce.
That's fine by me.
Minami?
Fura?
Your information helped us a lot.
{We helped with your information, tablets.}
Thank God, I'm glad to be of use to you.
Hey, what's with you and Arima...
Huh!
What is it?
That guy...
See!
, huh?
I don't know, but...
Gotta tell Arima!
Before that...
What's the matter?
... We are going after him!
You're right!
He entered this place?
Yes.
What's wrong, Arima?
Taishi, go  that way.
Minami, remain with me.
And don't go away from me.{And do not stay away from me.}
Y-Yes.
Arima...
What?
Arima, you're great.
The way you attack the enemy...
... Your strength is truly amazing.
You are really great.
And also, it may seem strange in a place like this
that I'm telling you this.
Oh, it's about time.
Arima.
Die!
Arima...!
You knew that I'm a ghoul, don't you?
Well, I don't care, anyway.
But hey, Arima.
Today we bring one more friend.
Hurry up, otherwise she would die soon.
{Hurry please, otherwise she would die, the tablets.}
I have to fight with a kid like him?
It's no fun at all.
Oye, what's the matter?
Which part should I eat first?
{Oye Bro. Want the part where I eat first?}
Choose!
You can't focus while being concerned
about fura.{You're so out of focus due to the Fura
worry, right?}
Gotcha! Gotcha!
Don't try to think about your friend.
You wouldn't use it against me?
Don't tell me!
Ba-bastard...!
Minami!
Arima! What does this mean?!
What the hell happened?!
He was .
What?
What does he mean... this...?
I-It's a lie, right?
Minami...!
I've......always yearned to be a normal girl.
Play, learn, I wanted to be like a human.
Then why be like this...?!
I hate that kind of people.
They don't know how lucky they are
and still they fool around.
And yet they seem like they
are not satisfied. {Yet, they make face like they are not satified.}
For reasons like that...
I'm so fed up with people like that!
That's why I killed them!
They may not be aware of their mistakes, because they are stupid!
It is true that they were stupid...!
Causing problems, hurting each other...
They are trash that could not be recycled.
But...
But...
They were precious to me...!
Even though you pretend to be a normal human being, but you won't possibly be
one! {Even though you yearn to be a normal human being, you won't possibly be one!}
You easily claimed the lives of human beings!
You're not human!
Arrogant one...!
Try being a ghoul, so that you can understand.
Lo-Look...
You're also...
... a killer.
Ah...
The exams are near.
and I had really prepared for it.
In the end, Minami's body was sent to CCG.
To prevent panic,
it was withheld by the school.
Arima also decided to change the school.
He says it's a case that has killed many investigators.
As always, Arima says,
"Maybe then we are the ones who will die."
Hey, these ghouls...
...do they look like normal humans,
like minami?
Either.
Because I have never talked with a .
Whatever happens they can never be like us...
I think I understand his feelings Minami.
Sorry.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Arima.
I will protect what I have to protect.
Perhaps this is stupid, so if impossible, then please tell me, huh?
I want to be...

Fura-san, apparently our target has moved.
Okay, then tell Ida to keep an eye on it
Understood!
Senior !
Senpai, you are fighting with ghouls every day. Won't Mrs Aki be angry?
Shut Up! Don't talk about
another man's wife at work.
I am sorry.
Arima, is concerned with the next case...
Mr.Arima has strong presence, doesn't he?
Fool, it's always like that.
Eh?
No.
Yes! Time for us to go home,
and serve our beloved family!
