Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."
The plant, the expansion,
these are for what Alexandria
can be after this.
They're all your people, Rick.
We haven't had a chance
to make it there.
You.
Today, I saw
what we could do
Carl, I wanna show you
the new world.
I woke up
this morning
Turned on some music
to start my day
I lost myself
in a familiar song
I closed my eyes
and I slipped away...
Do you have any toothpaste left?
No,
'cause someone's been borrowing
it every day for two weeks.
Carl.
What?
Denise says it's PT.
I can't hear you.
Come on out.
What?
Both:
Denise says this is PT.
- You heard me.
- Yeah.
It's time to change
your bandage.
And I need to borrow
some toothpaste.
Okay, but I'm out of toothpaste.
-
- I'll see you later.
Come on, sweetheart.
- You be good out there.
- Yeah, we'll see.
And thank you.
Oh.
Spearmint and baking soda.
That's my favorite.
Rick: Soon as I
get it, you will.
- Daryl:
- Yes?
This thing at the bottom
right here.
You're talking
about the drink, right?
I am, but...
It's not medical.
No, I drew a line between
the important stuff and that.
I just figured, if you saw it.
All right.
Anything remotely
medical is a priority.
And food, maybe even
food before medicine,
and gas or batteries or books for
the kids or clothes is just...
if you see it,
if it just happens to,
you know, be right there.
You like it, right?
No, I don't drink pop.
What the hell's pop?
Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.
Why you want it?
Tara was talking about it
in her sleep, I think.
Either she likes it
or she doesn't,
but if she likes it, it'd
be a really nice surprise.
I'm not good with
that kind of stuff,
and she and Heath are going
on that two-week run.
I just thought it'd be
a nice going-away present.
Just, uh, don't
go out of your way.
And if it gives you
any trouble...
I won't.
Okay, good, 'cause
it's not important.
I should've said so instead
of just drawing a line.
Got it.
I mapped out some of the agricultural
supply places in the area.
Even if they've
been cleaned out,
my bet is that the sorghum
would be untouched.
Now, that there is a
criminally underrated grain
that could change the game with our food
situation from scary to hunky-dunky.
I'm talking standability,
drought tolerance,
grain-to-stover ratio
that is the envy of all corns.
Think about it.
- Thanks.
- All right.
Okay.
- Rick: Today's the day.
- Daryl: Uh-huh.
Rick: We're gonna find
food, maybe some people.
The law of averages
has gotta catch up.
Daryl: I don't know. We ain't
seen nobody for weeks.
Maybe we ain't gonna
find nobody.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Don't.
Don't.
Please don't.
Man on radio: Give me
the downbeat, maestro.
I want to lay it
on the line
'Cause everything I do,
I wanna do it in double time
-
- Draws 'em away from home!
Hear me?
Action-packed
Well, if your music's
gonna move me
Well, I just gotta
feel the beat...

Maggie:
Where have you been?
What?
I never see you.
Everybody's been
working for weeks
to get this place back together
and you just disappear.
- Do you sit in your room all day?
- No.
Then where'd you go?
Nowhere.
You helped Glenn get home.
You helped me when I was
up in that guard post.
Yeah?
So maybe there are better places
for you to go than just nowhere.
I'm around.
Come talk to me.
Well, a chick
who's gonna move me
Well, she must
be gay and sweet
Well, two arms
made for lovin'
A lot of rhythm
in her feet
Hear me? I said
rhythm in her feet
No squares
ever tag along
Just to be near
this cat
Well, you chicks
is gonna move me
That gotta be
action-packed.
Hey, hold up.
It's best to be safe.
- You cover it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
One more time?
It ain't locked.
Well, how about that?
The law of averages.
Yep.
Let's get this thing going,
grab our gear, come
back for the car later.
Take another way back.
See what we can see.
Think it'll start?
Yeah, I do.
Sorghum.
Yo, give me a hand with this.
Ahem.
Let's flip it over.
I don't think we got it.
I got an idea.
It's soda and candy.
Why the trouble?
Daryl:
Hi.
Back up! Now!
Keep 'em up!
Whoa, easy, guys.
I was just running
from the dead.
How many?
I'm not risking it.
Once it gets to double
digits, I start running.
Daryl:
About a half a mile back.
They're headed this way.
You probably have
about 11 minutes.
Okay, thanks
for letting us know.
Yeah.
There's more of them
than us, right?
Gotta stick together.
Right?
You have a camp?
No.
Do you?
No.
Sorry for running into you.
I'm gonna go now.
If this is the next world,
I hope it's good to you guys.
I'm Rick.
This is Daryl.
Paul Rovia.
But my friends
used to call me Jesus.
Your pick.
You said you didn't have a camp.
You on your own?
Yeah.
But, still, best not
to try anything.
Best not to make threats
you can't keep, either.
Exactly.
- How many walkers...
- No, not this guy.
How many walkers
have you killed?
Sorry, gotta run.
You should, too.
Think you've got
about seven minutes.
What the hell was that?
He was clean.
His beard, it was trimmed.
There's more going on there.
He didn't have a gun, either.
We could track him,
watch him for a while,
get to know more.
See if he's really alone.
Maybe bring him back.
Nah, guy calls himself Jesus.
Firecrackers.
- Hell.
- Shit.
He swiped your keys, didn't he?
Oh, shit!
Sorry!
Shit.
Come on.
Come
I got him.
You think I couldn't get it?
Michonne:
I have a sword.
Mm.
What are you doing out here?
I was on guard. I saw
someone was in the woods.
What are you doing out here?
I walk after my shifts.
I've been doing it for a while.
You're the first one to notice.
Why the shovel?
I'm gonna keep walking now.
I'm gonna come with you.
That's okay.
Your mom told me I had to
figure out what I want...
for my whole life.
Have you?
I'm working up to it.
Right now I just
want to find out
why her son's wandering around
the woods with a shovel.
Look.
What's it say?
It got wet.
It's all gone.
Come on.
It doesn't look that old.
- Yeah?
- I mean, we can't read what they wrote,
but just by doing this,
they're saying something.
What?
"We're not alone."
We knew that.
We saw it.
People died.
Why are we coming out here?
'Cause we're kids.
It's what they do.
We're not kids.
This was a special
request from the doctor.
Hey, whatever she wants.
She saved Carl's life.
We didn't know her, and she
turned out to be all right.
If there's still
people out here,
and they're still people,
we should bring 'em in.
What, like this guy?
No, not this guy.
We still got a trail.
Let's go.
Come on.
It was just Michonne
and Spencer.
What were they doing?
Walking.
I don't know.
I don't want to
come out here anymore.
Okay.
Carl.
Michonne's out here.
I'm not leaving it.
No.
Hey, come on.
What are you doing?
Come on.
- What are you doing?
- Just go.
We should kill it.
- Go home.
- No.
- Enid.
- This is bullshit.
It should be dead.
- Let go.
- Just leave.
You're not killing it.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You wouldn't understand.
You don't want to be out here.
You said it.
So go home.
Hold still and maybe
we won't hurt you.
Sure thing.
-
- Ah!
This is done.
Do you even have any ammo?
Okay.
You gonna shoot me over a truck?
There's a lot of food
on that truck.
The keys, now.
I think you know
I'm not a bad guy.
Yeah?
What do you know about us?
Give me the keys.
This is the last time
I'm asking.
Damn it.
You're gonna leave
me here like this?
You're really gonna do that?
Eh, the knots aren't that tight.
You should be able
to get free...
after we're long gone.
Maybe we should talk now.
Nah.
Here.
In case you get thirsty.
So long, you prick!
Rick:
Today still is the day.
-
-
You were quiet like the TV,
hung up like the telephone
You were sleeping next to me, I
might as well have been alone...
Hey, look at that.
Yeah, a barn.
You hear that?
-
-
I think that son of a
bitch is on the roof.
Hold on.
- Mother...
- Daryl! Daryl!
We came to a conclusion,
asshole!
I got him!
Come here, you little shit!
Duck.
Thanks.
That's my gun!
-
- Come here!
Paul:
Uh, whoa!
-
-
You all right?
Yeah.
Law of averages.
That's bullshit, man.
Let's go check them cars,
get the hell out of here.
What about the guy?
What about him?
Well, he helped you.
Maybe.
He ever pull a weapon on you?
Fine.
Let's put him up a tree.
Why are you still here?
I liked your mom a lot.
I really don't want you to die.
So, come on.
- Let's go home.
- My family's dead. That's not home.
It's just where I live.
It's more than that.
Hey, enough.
I'm fine.
You've got a life back there,
and maybe I will, too,
but before I can even think about that,
I need to take care of something.
I have to try.
So let me help you.
You can't.
Carl?
I thought I saw her that night.
I thought I did.
I did.
I got her.
I got her.
So that's why I was out here.
She left me a note.
She said I still knew my way.
I never knew my way.
You loved your family?
Yeah.
Then you know your way.
It's home.
They're gone.
I've been out here chasing
you all over the woods.
You've still got family,
and you've still got a home.
-
- Let's go.
He took a pretty hard hit.
Denise needs to look him over.
Yeah.
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.
You wouldn't have left him.
I would've, right up in a tree.
- I would've.
- No. I know.
Almost as soon as we got
to Alexandria, you got it.
You saw... you...
and Michonne, Glenn,
you all tried to tell me.
- So shut up.
-
'Cause I'm finally listening.
See that bright one?
Yeah, that's the North Star.
It's at the end
of the Little Dipper.
Yeah.
If you get lost at night,
just find that star.
Hey.
Hey.
You have a good day?
I guess so.
I'm gonna take her in.
Carl.
I saw what you did.
Yeah?
You should've left her
or killed her.
No, that's stupid.
What's stupid is you being out
there when you don't have to.
You did the same thing.
You didn't...
you and Spencer didn't have
to go out there, but you did.
- That's different.
- It's not.
I wasn't gonna leave her
out there like that.
You wouldn't.
You wouldn't.
I know it.
I couldn't kill her.
- Why not?
- Because... be...
You could've killed her.
No, I couldn't.
I wouldn't.
Were you playing some
sort of game out there?
- Did you think that...
- No!
Then why?
Because it should be
someone who loved her,
someone who's family,
and I... I'd do it for you.
I would.
Come here.
Me, too.
You know, I was thinking...
back before we went
out to the quarry.
The morning after Reg and Pete.
You said we shouldn't be
looking for people no more.
You were right.
No...
I was wrong.
You were right.
- Sorry to wake you up.
- Who is this?
Come on, man, he's heavy.
Oh, that thing,
uh, didn't work out.
It's this asshole's fault.
Sorry.
Lay him on the bed.
All right, take a look at him.
He ain't staying, though.
We'll see.
It is pretty stupid of us
to go out there, isn't it?
Yep.
- Do it again tomorrow?
- Yep.
Move.
Hey.
She's practicing in her sleep.
Yeah.
It's good to be home.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Where's Daryl?
Watching over a guy
till some other guy
can take over.
You found a guy?
Crazy day.
You wanna talk about it?
No, not right now.
I just want to turn my
brain off for a minute.
You wanna tell me
about your day?
No.
Same thing.
What, you found a guy?
Not a guy.
Oh...
got you something.
Is this instead
of the toothpaste?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I do have a crate
of toothpaste for you.
It's currently
at the bottom of a lake.
Oh, so you had a day.
Yeah...
all on account
of your dental hygiene.
Have your mints.
Wait... wait a minute.
Okay.
