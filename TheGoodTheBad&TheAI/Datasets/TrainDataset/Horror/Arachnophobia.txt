Welcome!
Dr Atherton, I presume?
Wait! Not so fast!
We're in a hurry, Mr Manley!
We depart immediately.
Miguel Higueras, our assistant.
Mucho gusto.
Muy bien. Sorry I'm late.
I was held up in Caracas with fever.
Be sick on your own time,
Mr Manley!
I want close-ups of each specimen,
the forest and tepuis.
The what?
A tepui is a mountain with species
isolated for millions of years.
Any man-eating dinosaurs?
Only Atherton!
We'll hit a new one today.
Great Anybody ever get lost?
It's said men who climb
to the "rain desert" never return.
But don't worry - we'll fly!
He friendly?
I hope so.
He's our guide. Stick close.
Veinticuatro!
They bite?
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.
So do some of the frogs.
Don't touch any!
Great
This is where we're going.
We land here, then walk down.
It's a sinkhole. Thousands of years
of water have torn away the rock.
It's deep, 2,000ft, and dark at the
bottom. You'll need flash equipment.
Atencion, muchachos!
Stegolepis. Nutritious enough
to live on for weeks.
Thanks, I'll pass!
Plants your speciality?
Identifying new insects and spiders.
Great, just what the world needs
More bugs
What's your speciality, Manley?
Football.
Vamos! Vamos!
No-one mentioned poison ants
and frogs, but a 2,000ft drop?!
This is for the equipment.
Our guide will show us another way.
Vamonos!
Mr Manley!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Que pasa?
No voy. No voy.
What's with him?
This is as far as he'll go.
What?
Here we are.
Careful.
Careful, watch your step, man.
Amazing! The air temperature's
dropped 10 degrees in 100m!
Not far. Down there.
INAUDIBLE
Arrgghh! Arrgghh!
Manley, you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
HE SPEAKS IN SPANISH
What'd he say?
Be careful. You're too big
for us to carry out. Vamonos!
Wait up! Wait up!
What's that thing do?
Ever thrown a firecracker
into a pond?
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?
What happened?
All sorts of stuff floated
to the surface.
Exactly. Everybody ready?
ENGINE WHIRS NOSILY
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.
For what?
For pictures, Manley!
What is it?
I think it's a new species
of butterfly.
We could call it Photius Manlii.
LARGE THUD
Extraordinary!
Look at these markings!
Don't just sit there!
Are you sure it's dead?
Yes. Quite dead.
Two more.
Highly unusual. So many spiders
this size in a confined area!
Look at the abdomen.
We must find a live specimen!
HE SCREAMS
HISSING
What the devil are you doing?
It was alive!
Don't be ridiculous.
It's just a spider...
It wasn't just a spider.
It was potentially a species
unchanged for millions of years...
and all you could do is squash it.
Profesor! No esta muerto.
HE MURMURS IN SPANISH
No esta muerto.
Impossible. They should be dead.
Very aggressive! We'll take two
alive, and preserve two.
Are you sure that'll do it?
This stuff will kill an elephant.
Millions of years,
then we come along!
How long will it take to get back?
What's wrong?
Still worried about dinosaurs
This place gives me the creeps.
Incredible!
What is?
They have no reproductive organs.
Almost like worker bees
or soldier ants.
Well...if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general!
How are you feeling?
Like hell. This fever's killing me.
You don't look so good. Take a rest.
Ow!
HE CHOKES
STRANGLED CRIES
Senor!
Senor!
Profesor! Profesor! Profesor!
Esta muerto?
The fever.
Make sure we've got all his film.
Have we notified his family?
I've contacted the US Consulate.
OK, seal him up.
HE SPEAKS SPANISH
I wish you wouldn't complain
about my driving!
You're pushing it, that's all!
Take it easy! Wait a minute!
All right.
Can you give me a hand?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, gee...
Oh, God!
I think I'll go move the hearse.
I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.
I know we decided on an open casket,
but we should maybe reconsider.
I'm not sure how they work
down in South America...
but let me say their preservation
methods differ from ours.
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide...
But in this difficult time,
I'm not sure I would...
You do have the option...we could
put a photo on top of the casket.
Yeah. The one you had
in the newspaper would be nice.
Yeah. Oh, good.
All right.
DOG WIMPERS
CAT MIAOWS
BIRD SCREECHES
OK, kids, stake out your rooms!
Give me that!
Shelley!
Oh, Ross, smell that air!
HE SNEEZES
Oh, God!
Before we find what broke
in the move and that the breakfront
doesn't fit in the dining room,
let's chant,
"We did the right thing".
BOTH: We did the right thing.
For the kids.
For all of us.
Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends...
Hey, Dad,
there's a dead bird over here!
Well, don't touch it! Just go
into the house and find your sister.
Ross, the town is yours!
You're THE doctor.
Is there a more respected figure?
Respect is fine,
but I want to be feared.
Easy with that! That's... Don't...
Don't want to agitate the sediments.
Chateau Margaux. 127 bucks a bottle.
Tasty, huh?
At that price, who can drink it?
Goes in the basement.
I mean, the cellar.
The wine cellar.
I need a big padlock,
protect my investment.
Dad! Dad!
What? What's wrong?
Behind the boxes, a spider!
A spider? OK.
It was ugly! This big!
Calm down!
You're in the country now.
OK? Let's go find that spider.
Let's find Mom to take care of it.
Honey, we're in the living room!
We need you to kill a spider.
All right. Where is it?
Over there on the box!
Killing a spider? Cool!
Bad luck to kill one in a new house!
Just made that up, dear?
OK. Everything's OK.
Oh, poor thing!
It's more scared than we are.
Let's give it a home in the barn.
Yeah, good idea, Shell.
How come you're not afraid
of bugs like Dad?
I'm not afraid of bugs, just...
Careful of rusty nails!
Dad, chill out!
Right here.
Yeah!
There. OK?
You won't miss
being in the thick of things?
Stars winking, crickets singing...
we ARE in the thick of things.
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.
Christmas bonuses.
Office politics. Caffeine.
Adrenaline. Steady income.
We'll be fine.
Between my severance and your
potential patients, we'll be fine.
When are you meeting Dr Metcalf?
Thursday. The old coot passes
the torch at 10 sharp.
Wait.
We can unpack in the morning.
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement...cellar.
Ross, I'm exhausted.
It's bad luck not to make love
in a new house.
You just made that up,
didn't you, dear
I have terrific news. Well,
for my patients it's terrific...
..my wife is less than thrilled.
What's that, Dr?
I'm postponing retirement.
I don't know for how long, but...
But?
I realised there's only one thing
left to do when you retire...
.. and too many friends have done
that 6 months after giving up work.
But you...
When we spoke four months ago,
you assured me...
I'm not ready to retire, Doctor!
And if my wife can't rush
me into it, you sure as hell can't!
Excuse me.
You got to feed the meter, partner.
Well, I was just leaving.
Hmm, a little late, though.
I do have medical plates.
Oh, right! You're that new doctor!
Ross Jennings.
Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.
You're a Yale grad?
That's right, yeah.
Yeah!
Just a school, isn't it
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.
You're writing him a ticket!?
What're you doing?!
What the whole town ought to do!
Your ticker-tape parade!
That's littering, Miss Hollins!
Lloyd's been
a bully since 5th grade.
I know, I held him back!
Walk me to my automobile.
Thanks! How'd you know who I was?
We're neighbours. I gave you
a standing ovation when you arrived.
Sam Metcalf only recently
gave up leeches.
He also gave up retirement!
We came thinking I'd have
his patients, now I've none!
No, Dr Jennings! You have one!
Look at this light! On the best day
in the city we didn't get this!
Maybe they'll give me a show.
They do that in little towns.
"Molly Jennings - A Retrospective."
I need to take pictures first!
There's good news and bad.
Shall we go in reverse alphabetical
order, start with the good?
Mm-hm.
I'm seeing my first patient today...
A great old dame, lives up the road.
Terrific. What's the bad?
She's my only patient.
Today?
Metcalf changed his mind.
What?
He panicked.
He says if he retires, he'll lose
his zest for life and die
within 48 hours or something.
But we looked
in 14 different towns!
We bought a house! You rented
an office! What'll we do?
Kill him?
I have my fax machine.
I'll work part-time. Phone and fax
is all I need. My old clients...
Honey, we'll be fine,
just like you said.
With one patient?
Maybe I'll be lucky
and she'll be ravaged by disease.
Like having seven patients in one.
Fit as a fiddle!
Not a damned thing wrong!
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.
Think I was hoping
you were ravaged by disease?
What about my high blood pressure?
You have above normal
systolic pressure - less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.
It doesn't need treatment.
Do I need these?
There's a difference between the two
types of hypertension. I think...
Dr Metcalf doesn't know
the difference between
his ass and a hole!
Folks are comfortable with him...
Though when he first hit town
they were standoffish.
How did he overcome it?
He threw a party, invited the town.
If he were half as good at medicine
as he is at public relations,
he could run for Surgeon General!
Next month, when the afternoons are
cooler, we'll throw you a party!
Thanks.
SHE GASPS
So, is your one patient
a walking health hazard?
I couldn't find a wart on her.
Great So what do we do?
Enjoy the fact that now we don't
live in the city, we needn't
call this pasta.
Skinny spaghetti?
No, Daddy's not done.
Margaret, my tragically
healthy patient, will throw
a get-to-know-Dr Jennings party.
No, Daddy's not done!
Some punch with the new GP
and Canaima will
abandon Doc Metcalf...
It's a nice gesture.
Yeah, I thought so.
Can we play with Bunny?
Yeah. I want you both in
before dark, though.
Bunny Beechwood. She popped up this
morning. A neighbour. Seems nice.
Bet they'll chase fireflies
or something?
Wanna blow up a bullfrog? OK!
I got great shots in the barn!
If my camera picks up the web
with the detail my eyes did...
The web?
Our spider
made himself a hell of a home!
Even you would appreciate it!
Molly, how can I make this
more clear? I have a...
Terrible fear of spiders.
I've seen what happens.
Which is why you should
force yourself to look at the web.
Look at the web?!
See it for the extraordinary,
beautiful thing it is.
Therapy! We live in the country.
Time to work out
this irrational, paralysing terror.
It's not irrational.
I know. The incident.
It's like yesterday.
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two!
It's my first memory.
I can envision the crib,
all around me, clear as day.
I can feel waking up, drowsy,
peaceful, secure - and there it was.
Probably a daddy-longlegs.
It seemed huge.
It came crawling through the bars
of the crib, touched my bare leg...
You were wearing a diaper.
All my limbs froze, just froze!
You were still half-asleep.
I was paralysed, Molly!
Try to understand
how it makes me feel.
I was unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin!
I can still feel
its hairy little legs, just...
Then up to my face...
I felt utterly helpless,
being explored by an alien thing!
Can you blame me
for being a spider...phobe...?
Arachnophobe.
Whatever.
You see it up there?
Right behind the ladder.
Impressive, huh?
Therapy, right?
Right.
Yeah.
Oh...
Oh, God!
You see? You still
have full use of all your limbs.
God, have you seen it up here?
Molly, I think you spared
the 8-legged Frank Lloyd Wright!
Ross!
BOTH SCREAM
Are you OK? Honey, it's OK!
What the hell was that?!
It's... Ugh!
Come on!
Oh, God! Oh, no!
HE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY
Jesus!
Hold me, hold me!
No, no! No!
Oh, my God!
FRANK SINATRA:
# The summer wind came blowing in
# From across the sea
# It lingered there
and touched your hair
# And walked with me
# All summer long... #
No, thanks.
How do you find life here?
After a few initial shocks,
we're adjusting.
I've been checking on you.
When I'm ready to throw in
the towel, Dr Jennings is your man.
Henry Beechwood.
Ross. Jennings.
By all accounts, a fine physician.
I'll remember that.
This brings back memories!
When I moved here,
the whole town threw me a party.
No, you threw yourself a party!
Now, THAT was a party!
Now, THAT is a jerk!
Canaima welcomes you.
Thank you.
I was interested in something.
Could you give me a little help?
Should I have this removed?
What's Bunny showing them?
Green Beret
hand-to-hand combat methods.
Becky, thought about
what you'll major in at college?
Gym.
It's in the genes.
Bobby's a Bronco star quarterback.
Hi.
He could throw a football before
he could walk! I coach the team.
Nepotism, huh?
Actually, we're Baptists.
Nobody says to a mortician,
"Irv, think I might be dead?"
Drive you nuts?
Dipping a Dorito as somebody
shows you his growth!
How do you handle it?
I just mention that my wife
was a successful stockbroker.
What about
artificial intelligence stock?
Why shouldn't I have another?
You've had too much.
No! I'm thirsty!
Oh, that's awful! How?
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.
Photographer.
He was on an expedition
down in Venezuela.
Nobody'd tell me how! Or
even let me see him to say goodbye!
Let's go.
Why wouldn't they let me see him?
I don't understand!
I had to recommend a closed coffin.
His body looked all chewed up.
Drained.
Like some vampire had a go at him.
It was something terrible.
Excuse us.
Oh, yeah.
That's the apple?
Bet you made enough friends
to break Sam's death grip!
We can't thank you enough.
Nor I you, for freeing
me from the pills!
I feel I could compete
in a triathlon!
After your check-up, I agree!
Bye-bye, Margaret.
Bye, Molly.
Irv! Blaire!
Would you like a doggie bag?
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!
Come on, honey, the party's over!
Happy hunting, Felix!
See you in the morning!
You'd have had too much punch,
and been the life of the party.
I missed you!
Aaargh!
Ross! Ross!
Molly?
Ross!
I could have killed you!
The nails came straight... Oh, God!
It's all rotten. My wine cellar
is probably crawling with termites!
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor!
Well, I'll call the exterminator.
You're casual
about the death of my dream!
I tried to thank Margaret
for yesterday, but her line's busy.
She's probably gabbing.
You want me to...
Yeah, OK,
I'll go over and check on her.
CAT MIAOWS
Here, Kitty!
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!
Margaret!
What'd you think, Doc?
Heart attack. Bound to happen
sooner rather than later.
She had high blood pressure,
even with pills.
I took her off those.
What right did you have?
She came to me as a patient.
You didn't see
she was hypertensive?
Her diastolic reading was normal,
her systolic below 160.
This is a very serious matter,
young man!
You may have killed her.
She was in fine shape. I want
an autopsy.
Never!
She was my patient.
And mine for 40 years!
She wouldn't want to be butchered!
Nobody would want it for her!
Give it to me, Irv.
I'm satisfied if you are, Doc.
You come from a city,
where people don't care!
I don't expect you to understand.
A little advice.
To fit in, learn to be
sensitive to people's feelings!
I'm interested in medicine,
not public relations
Cardiac victims
don't bite their tongues off!
She had tetanic convulsions.
This case isn't closed!
You're damn right!
I believe you may be guilty
of medical malpractice!
I intend to pursue it!
I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.
Come by the gym tomorrow at 3.
I'll throw you some business.
Thank you, Henry!
Thanks, I appreciate that!
Nice. Think he could say it
a little louder, though
MUSIC PLAYS
HE SIGHS
A little young, isn't it?
The wine?
No. Margaret. To die at 68.
You know, that's 10 years below life
expectancy of a Caucasian female.
You're a fine doctor. You knew what
you were doing taking her off pills.
Like when I chose this town...
with the country doctor from hell,
or this house, which is rotting
from the ground up
I'll take care of that.
Well, Margaret's
still gonna be dead in the morning.
I still wanna know what killed her.
He was nailing something in the
cellar, and the wood disintegrated.
Termites, huh?
That's what my husband thought.
He's an expert in these matters
Well, no...
Didn't think so.
I'm glad you called me.
No room for amateurs in this game.
Oh! Oh!
Ah, thank you.
Haa!
What is it?
It's hard to say.
Would anybody object
if I tore the floor out?
I would!
False alarm, then. Lead on.
How bad is it?
Ssshh!
I didn't find a thing.
Then why is the wood rotting?
I'll tell you why.
Bad wood.
So...what do we do?
Tear out bad wood.
Put in good wood.
My husband thought
this'd make a good wine cellar.
Yeah? I collect beer cans myself.
I got a rare '74 Miller Lite
with a misprinted label.
Only 100 in circulation.
He might want a look.
Oh, no hard shoes on the court.
Sorry.
I know what a blow losing Margaret
was. People keep score. You're only
as good as your last game.
I appreciate your concern.
I want you to enjoy Canaima.
Clean water, fresh air.
No police sirens wailing all night!
Just crickets up the wazoo!
Actually,
I haven't heard any crickets lately.
I haven't, either.
OK, Broncos, the doc's here!
Get ready to drop 'em!
Doc wants to hear you cough!
HE COUGHS
MORE COUGHING
HE COUGHS
HE COUGHS FEEBLY
Call yourself Broncos? You look
like babies! Come on! Snap to it!
On the ball.
Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
Another play.
Come on, you're moving
in slow motion!
Move it! Move it!
Hike!
A banana-out?!
That's a banana-split!
Shitty pass!
I heard that, McGrath!
Garbage-mouth! Wash that mouth out!
Miller! Yo!
You know the patterns?
Like the back of my hand!
Get in here!
Run the same thing again.
Come on, we're waiting on you!
Let's go!
Come on, Miller! Wanna play?
Let's go!
Thanks.
Run it!
Set! Hut! Hike!
Arrggh!
Come on! Come on, up, up!
Easy up! Let's up!
That's back! Let's go!
Miller, you all right?
Coach!
What's wrong with Miller?
Back up, let him breathe!
What's wrong? What is it?
Come on, give him some air!
OK, let's get his helmet off.
Real easy.
Support his head. Easy, easy!
Real gentle.
Real gentle.
Look out, look out.
From what I hear
it wasn't a very hard tackle.
I only wish I knew. You see,
Dr Jennings examined him last.
Hey...
Why so gloomy?
Bunny Beechwood says
everybody's calling you Dr Death.
That's just silly, Shelley.
They say you want
to cut people up into pieces.
Oh, Tom, look.
It's called an autopsy.
It's not a pleasant thing.
But sometimes it's the only way
to see what happened.
But some doctors won't accept it.
Some doctors won't accept
city methods don't work
in a small town.
Both Margaret and that poor boy did
seem healthy. Odd, don't you think?
If I autopsied every heart attack,
I'd be run out of Canaima!
Poor Sam. You think life
is a popularity contest!
You're not jealous
of our new doctor?
What?!
You made me lose my timing!
You're yelling, Sam.
Come on to bed.
Come on!
I need a shower.
I'd love to take walks
around the neighbourhood with you.
It's not the same, Evelyn.
I need to know how far I've gone,
and exactly how long it took me.
Floor's cold, Sam.
You're right. You're always right!
Damn!
What's wrong?
Some damn thing bit me.
It's just a spider!
Spider?
It felt like a damn cougar! Damn!
Damn!
I'm having a seizure!
Sam, what should I do?
Get an ambulance. Call Jennings.
My God!
I'll be right there.
What's going on?
Metcalf. He's having a seizure.
Thank God you didn't examine
HIM this morning!
Why's the Coroner here?
I don't know.
Milt, this isn't necessary!
I'll be the judge, Lloyd.
Wait out here.
Guard the house, or something, hmm?
Guard the house
Was he alive when you got here?
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.
Whatever it was,
it was abrupt and acute.
Massive coronary
or cerebral haemorrhage?
His wife says he was bitten
by a spider before he seized.
Oh, right
Sam told me about you.
The hotshot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.
I'll accept it if I agree with it.
Good.
Let me show you something.
Down here.
I believe that's a spider bite.
I'll buy that.
But I doubt that killed him.
In 20 years I've seen one
spider-bite fatality...
a black widow and a child.
No, my guess is
Sam overexerted himself.
He used the treadmill
before he keeled over.
Yeah, well, you may be right.
I want an autopsy.
Tissue samples, blood toxicology.
Wait just one second!
Shut up, Lloyd.
You'll get Evelyn's permission?
Of course.
Need a ride home?
No, I'm all right, thanks.
Take care! You're the town doctor!
Say "Ah".
Ahhh.
OK, we'll treat this inflammation
with antibiotics.
So I don't get any ice cream?
I'll buy you a double scoop!
Who's next?
I'll take that, thank you!
Step right this way.
Have a seat. Be right with you.
Thank you.
OK, hotshot, are you sitting down?
Sam died from a minute amount
of an unidentified toxic substance
in his blood.
'My office isn't ruling out
poisoning, or even killer spiders.
'It looks like a heart attack to me,
but I'll support
whatever you'd like to do.'
I gotta have those bodies exhumed,
Milt. I gotta be sure.
OK, whatever you think necessary.
Thanks.
Are you out of your mind?
Once more, I want Margaret Hollins
and Todd Miller exhumed.
Hey! Hey! Hey...
You pull them out the ground when
they should be enjoying
eternal rest...
I'll just get a court order!
Milt Briggs is on my side.
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale Graduate, Big City Doctor!
No shit
Hi, Dad!
Hi, honey!
What's going on?
Shelley's staying
the night with Bunny.
We'll take good care of her,
Dr Jennings.
Wait.
There may be some spiders
that are very dangerous, OK?
I want you to be aware of this.
If you see one,
don't try to capture or kill it.
Just run. You understand?
Run!
We'll do that, Dr Jennings.
Don't worry about anything.
THEY GIGGLE
BUNNY: Yo, Dr Death!
Are you all right?
No.
All clear.
"The spider was asleep.
It had been a very, very busy day."
OK, your turn, Bunny.
# The itsy-bitsy SPIDER...
SHE SQUEALS
# Crawled up the water spout
# Down came the rain
and washed the spider out
# Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain
# And the itsy-bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again. #
It's my turn now.
"Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
eating her curds and whey.
"Along came a SPIDER...
THEY BOTH SCREAM
"..that sat down beside her, and
frightened Miss Muffet...
BOTH: Aarrgghh!
Settle down, or Shelley can't stay!
We can't sleep!
We keep scaring each other.
Why don't you sleep in my room
for a while? OK.
Nah, we don't need this.
Argh! Oh, God!
CRICKET CHIRPS
You son of a bitch!
FRANTIC CHIRPING
Where are the other crickets?
Where are all your buddies?
PHONE RINGS
Atherton.
Yes, Dr Atherton?
I'm Ross Jennings.
I'm a general practitioner and I've
a problem that may be spider related.
You're the foremost authority
on the West Coast, or any coast!
Every so often in some little town
there's a health scare -
an unexplained outbreak.
Spiders make convenient culprits.
'On every suburban acre there are
and each spider
eats about 100 insects a year?
'So, 5 million insects are consumed
per acre annually.'
Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders.
'I've nothing against them,
but we've had 3 deaths and I fear
there'll be more.
'Lend me your
expertise for an afternoon.'
It's a town called Canaima.
Canaima?
'Yeah. You know it?'
It's familiar.
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you, exactly?
Collins. Collins!
Oh. Sorry.
Are you equally busy tomorrow
Dr Atherton?
No, Chris Collins, his assistant.
I'm Chris. Atherton's busy.
He's found a new species
of spider in South America.
Er, to us it's a big deal.
I hope you can help.
We'll be examining bodies.
Sounds like a blast
We're looking for bites.
Like this.
That's a spider, isn't it?
Er, I'm not sure. I think so.
But even at several times
the potency of Latrodectus...
Latro... Black widow, right?
Right. It'd take more than
one bite to kill. This death
and the bite are coincidental.
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Poor Margaret!
She was a good wife,
good teacher, good neighbour...
Excellent cook.
Anything you want, just shout.
I want some fresh air.
Chris! Chris! Come here!
Still think it's a coincidence?
That's a spider bite.
The tissue around it is macerated.
A mark behind the left ear.
PHONE RINGS
Atherton.
'Chris Collins.
'We've a big problem in Canaima.
'They've 3 dead. The cause seems
to be a spider deadlier
than any I've seen.
'They want to quarantine the town!'
Are you sure?
This is way out of my league.
It's a decision you have to make.
You better come up.
I can be there
tomorrow afternoon...
But, Collins,
try and find me a specimen.
HE BREATHES HEAVILY
Bring the keys? ^
Great. Perk up, Lloyd!
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him!
Milt, will you cover
the living room?
Chris, you check out back.
And, Lloyd...take the kitchen.
I'll just... I'll oversee...
I'll just coordinate the...
I'll just stay right here.
What is all that crap?
Leftovers. Mostly cricket parts.
Wings, legs.
We haven't heard any crickets
for weeks.
Arrggh!
Ross! Here! Ross!
Sheriff, don't move!
It's dead! Shit!
What could have killed it?
The shock of seeing Lloyd?
KNOCK ON DOOR
There are other people
in this house!
Dad, go away!
Dad, go away!
Use the one down here, Henry!
SHE SCREAMS
Never a moment's peace!
SHE SCREAMS
What happened? Are you OK?
SHE SCREAMS AGAIN
Why don't we take the dead spider
and get out?
You don't get off that easy!
The dead spider's desiccated.
No use to us.
You mean macerated.
No, desiccated.
Dried up, drained of blood.
Macerated is the...
Chewing they do.
Chewing, right.
They're like little vampires.
This trip to find
the spider species, where'd he go?
South America. Venezuela. Why?
Is that one of 'em?
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.
Ross, you're gonna
have to take a step towards it.
Chris, I'm scared to death!
We all are, but our brains secrete
a neuro-transmitter to help us.
I don't have
that particular neuro-transmitter.
Yes, you do.
Wow.
DOG BARKS
You need an asbestos glove,
the Doomsday weapon
in Delbert's war on creepy-crawlies.
I coat it with Denon EC.
It's biodegradable, organic.
You should see the beasties twitch
when they get a whiff!
Er, Delbert...
There's a rumour going
that a spider killed Sam,
maybe Margaret, even my Bronco.
Doubtful, Henry.
In Florida, one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.
Over a dozen bites, and lived.
Course, he probably lost control
of his bodily functions.
Nothing here.
But I'll hunt the alleged arachnid
and spritz him to kingdom come.
DOG BARKS
Yeah, that's right! I'm bad!
KNOCK ON DOOR
Dr Atherton... Ross Jennings.
Come in.
Did you find another specimen?
Yes. I also called
the town mortician.
Months ago, there was a corpse.
The body was desiccated,
drained of blood.
Irv agreed, if the spider was big
and spent long enough on the body...
I know why you've heard of Canaima.
This was Jerry Manley's hometown.
Manley the photographer?
I think a Venezuelan spider hitched
a ride in his coffin.
The fangs, injectors,
are disproportionately large.
Now, let's test the venom.
The toxin and amount injected
determine the effect of the bite.
And the place
where the subject is bitten.
It can lead to paralysis or death.
SQUEAKING
I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.
I'd agree.
No sex organs.
That would make them drones -
or soldiers!
That's typical in organised insects
- bees, ants. I never saw it
in spiders!
I have.
Venezuela, right?
Right. This is a descendant.
Somehow, a male mated with a house
spider to make a deadly strain.
But with no sex organs,
it can't reproduce.
True. And the accelerated growth
rate suggests a short life cycle.
We already saw a dead one.
That could be the good news!
Let's discuss the bad!
The species I found in S America
live at the top of the food chain.
They spread out
from a nest in a web-like pattern,
and dominate the area.
In their habitat, they're contained
by geography - not true here.
So the original male's
the granddaddy of 'em all,
and he's sending troops to battle.
Right. Er...
Excuse me! Professor?
This is our town exterminator.
McClintock.
Nice to meet a colleague.
He came across one of the offenders
a few hours ago.
Have you brought it with you?
It's still on the bottom of my shoe.
You can't tell what it is any more.
In this first generation,
the original male produced a queen.
They'll build a nest
for the queen to guard.
She'll create
reproductive offspring,
and then this town is dead.
And the next town,
the next town, and the next.
Irv owns the mortuary where it
originated. If we kill the male...
And nest.
I'll call the Dept of Agriculture.
OK. Phone's in the office.
See you at the mortuary.
Sheriff, give me a ride.
I am not a chauffeur!
Shut up, Lloyd.
Damn! It's busy!
Irv takes the phone off the hook
for Wheel of Fortune.
Let's go!
NOISE FROM TV
Blaire, real or fake butter?
Fake!
Irv, hurry!
Buttery, hot and delicious!
'$1,000. T. There are two Ts.
That's quite a start!'
He needs to buy a vowel.
Buy a vowel!
TYRES SCREECH
Delbert!!
What'll this nest look like?
Well, you'd know if you found it.
The area would be dark, warm, moist.
A musty smell,
and you'd see an egg sac.
Like your basic egg sac.
Uh, white, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.
And no other spiders around.
What do you mean?
Spiders are cannibals, she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.
Tell them - even if it means
interrupting a dinner party!
Sheriff!
Where is this?
The Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.
Take me there!
NOISE FROM TV
Hey, Irv! Irv!
Ross...
Canaima welcomes you.
Irv, we have an emergency! We...
Aarrghh!
I'll get us into the mortuary.
Ross. Ross!
We've found it!
Go to the mortuary, get
my assistant and the exterminator.
Right, I'll do that.
Stay here, sir - I'm not
responsible for you! Fine!
The killings are so arbitrary,
maybe there's more than one nest.
No, there's just one.
What was it Atherton said?
They radiate
from a central nest. Got a map?
Thinking about buying here...?
Come on, get a map, please!
Here. Here.
The Kendalls. The Kendalls' house.
Mark that down on there.
And the old guy - the doctor.
Metcalf.
Kid died on the football field
behind the school.
This is fun!
I found one at Beechwoods'.
The old lady...
Margaret.
Is that all of them? That's it.
In the centre, that's the mortuary?
No, that's a house.
Who the hell lives there?
I do.
The whole time the nest was
in MY barn!
I doubt it. A spider
would find your barn a tad breezy.
In that respect,
spiders are like you and me.
I frankly doubt the nest is there.
I frankly know it is.
I was in the barn.
I saw a web. There's a web.
A web does indicate
an arachnoid presence.
They got a saying
in Benelux countries...
Just drive, Delbert.
Just get us there, please!
My, you've been busy! Incredible!
Supper's ready!
Come and get it!
HE SCREAMS
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy what's in the barn!
Check.
Better uncork my private stock.
There may be spiders in the house!
Yeah, right, let's go.
Give me a minute to look around
here, then we go in.
Hello-o-o!
HE WHISTLES
Hello-o-o! Trick or treat!
Hey!
Gotcha! Got ya!
Now, let's see what we got up here.
Aargh!
Oh, my God!
They got the professor.
'How come she's not here?
'She had meetings...'
Honey!
In here, Ross!
Hi, Dad.
I expected you for dinner,
I got worried.
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.
SHE GASPS
OK, every...
Everybody just get up,
very slowly...
..and walk towards the door.
OK, quick and quiet!
We're gonna need
another way out of here.
Upstairs...the bathroom.
Climb onto the roof. Quick!
Just go!
Watch yourself, Ross!
Come on, Shelley! That's right!
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Ross!
They're swarming!
I've never seen them so aggressive!
They're chasing us.
Hi, you guys. I'm Chris.
Ah! Spiders!
Put that under the door!
Oh, God!
Mom, where are we going?
I'll go first.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, Shelley!
One at a time!
Careful out there!
Down the trellis, honey!
Ross! Ross!
Ross, get out of there!
Wait for me! Tommy!
Ross, get out of there!
Where's Ross?
Right behind me! Oh, no!
Shit!
BOTH: Spiders! Spiders!
Shelley, Tommy, come here!
Get them away from the house!
Rock and roll!
MUFFLED: All right, party time!
Yeah! Yeah!
Take that! Come on!
HISSING
Arrghh!
Argh!
What is it?
Musty...musty smell, moist, dark...
No spiders. There's no spiders.
It's dark, musty. It's the nest.
Nest.
Nest. The queen.
Oh, shit! I'm in the goddamn nest!
Help! Help!
Chris!
I found the nest!
And there's the queen!
Chris! Shit!
Arrggh!
Come on!
HE SCREAMS
Therapy!
That's your basic egg sac.
Be right back!
HISSING
HE GROANS
Where is it?
That was the goddamn general!
Help! Help!
HISSING ^
HISSING
HISSING
Not the Chateau.
HISSING
Argh!
HE LAUGHS
Goddamn it, where are you?!
Damn it!
^ SCUFFLING NOISE
HE LAUGHS
The itsy-bitsy spider...
climbed up the water spout.
Down came the rain...
and washed the spider out.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Aaarggh!
IT SQUEALS
Shit!
SQUEALING
SQUEALING
Nice shot!
Thank God!
Don't mention it!
Ross! Ross!
Ross, it's OK.
Everything's OK.
Jesus! God, spiders!
Most are dead. The ones
Delbert didn't get are dying.
The kids...?
The kids are fine. Everybody's OK.
TONY BENNET SINGS:
# I left my heart
# In San Francisco
# High on a hill... #
Know what I'll miss
about the country?
What?
I dunno. That's why I'm asking.
At least we got out with our lives.
Yes.
And the Margaux.
To office politics, Xmas bonuses,
caffeine, adrenaline...
To things we know,
events we can control...
RUMBLING
That was a minor tremor.
It wouldn't even show
on that scale...that...
Richter scale.
Just a cable car going by.
Cable car, yeah.
We should check the kids.
The kids!
