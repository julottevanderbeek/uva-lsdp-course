- Hello, Dove.
- Croatoan.
Not "Dad"?
Clearly we have a lot of catching up to do.
What they did to you, turning you
into the Barn's controller...
Could you do it to me?
Vince! What have you done?
What I had to.
It's a Holloway trouble,
where a building merges with a person.
Are you trying to talk to me?
It's Laverne.
Who am I talking to right now? Duke?
No.
This is what I am.
Croatoan's inside your head.
You can force him out.
Don't let him control you.
Daddy?
I need to teach you a lesson.
You can control the Troubles
that you take from people?
They're gifts, and in the right hands,
they can accomplish anything.
I created you.
All the times that you
asked me to kill for you,
look what I have become,
what you turned me into.
I got snacks from the vending machine.
Please tell me you got the P3 unstuck,
and that's a Baby Ruth in your hand.
- Sorry.
- Ah.
Granola.
Laverne controls the vending machine now.
She only dispenses the healthy stuff.
A little healthy wouldn't hurt.
How you holding up?
You must be exhausted.
Croatoan locked me in a child's room
and said he was going to help
my friends, make them happy.
It was scarier than a flat-out threat.
Sounds terrifying.
I'm sorry.
He was different than I expected.
So much hurt.
He really thinks that he's
doing the right thing.
By getting you to help him trouble people.
It's more than that.
He's a father that wants his daughter back.
But you are not his daughter.
Mara was. She's dead.
But when he looks at me, he sees her.
Which is why we need to
get this thing fixed,
get that Barn built, send that
monster back to the Void.
Has Vince come up with anything yet?
No, not yet.
Dwight's working on it with him.
He's got him stashed away just in case...
In case Duke comes after him.
Has anybody seen him since
he took the census?
No.
If Croatoan gets those Troubles,
he's going to use them against us.
He is not gonna get the chance.
We're gonna get Duke back.
Victor Kirby.
I knew your aunt.
She could see the future too.
Anyone she touched...
Vanessa knew exactly how
they were going to die.
What do you want?
Your trouble.
But why?
It's horrible.
Not for Croatoan.
He can turn it into a power,
use it to show his daughter
how amazing the future can be
if she joins him.
Please don't.
You look so worried, Kirby.
But don't you know what's going to happen?
Haven't you seen how you're
going to meet your end?
I've tried,
but I can only see how
other people die, not me.
If you had seen it,
it would've looked a lot like this.
I know how it ends for you, Crocker.
I can see it.
Just like Vanessa did.
I'm not that man anymore.

Vince says there's nothing
in his new programming
to fix the Aether core.
I was afraid of that.
How's he doing otherwise?
He says he feels mostly the same,
but it's gotta be weird.
Being turned into an
otherworldly crystal, yeah.
I'd feel better if I at least
knew where you hid it.
You can trust me, Nathan.
Of course I can.
You keep working with Vince.
We'll try to and figure out a
way to fix the core on our end.
I'll call you if we manage
to come up with something.
Why don't you want to
tell them about Lizzie?
Because you're afraid they'll take her?
I need to know what she is.
An Aether creature maybe...
Like the ones William made?
Or a product of a trouble?
A resurrection trouble.
You don't think she could
actually be Lizzie?
No. My daughter's dead.
It's Duke. He's out there.
Daddy, what's wrong?
Nothing, honey. Everything's fine.
Why is he just standing there?
What's he waiting for?
Okay, I want you to take
Lizzie to the back stairs.
If Duke comes in, I want you to both run.
But what about you?
I'll buy you some time.
Couple of minutes.
You can't confront him.
I can't let him get a hold of you.
He might be here for Lizzie.
Please.
Lizzie, I need you to go
with Uncle Vince, okay?
No, I want to stay here with you.
Honey, it's a game.
You and Vince go hide
and see how long it takes
for me to find you.
Oh, I love hide and seek.
Okay, you count down from
Come on. I know a good hiding spot.
Oh, he was stabbed in the chest.
It looks like Duke's work, all right.
Poor Victor. He didn't stand a chance.
Anyway, I gotta go.
Intern's watching baby Aaron,
and she keeps giving him apple juice.
You think Croatoan's tough,
try an infant on a sugar high.
Vickie.
Vickie still has her sketching trouble.
So maybe if she can draw the Aether core,
she can put it back together.
- She can make it whole again.
- It's worth a shot.
I'll have her meet us at the station.
Croatoan.
You must be Nathan.
An "ask questions later" kind of guy.
- I like you already.
- You bastard...
Nathan, the Troubles he holds...
We can't hurt him.
Smart, pragmatic.
That's my girl.
And right as usual.
Strike me, and your
internal organs liquefy.
A trouble I gathered from your census.
Why did Duke kill Kirby?
To take his trouble?
Collecting Troubles was
what I designed him to do.
So you could take them with
you, use them for your revenge?
No, you're going to design those Troubles.
Oh, these are for my personal use.
So what, you're just here
to make sure Duke stays on schedule?
No, no, Duke's fine.
I'm here to talk to you, Nathan.
You're a lucky man.
From my conversations with my daughter,
I can tell she loves you very much.
And she'll do anything to make you happy.
And that's very hard to find.
Leave Nathan alone.
As I promised you, I'm here to help him.
Nathan,
what if I could offer you
a new life far from here,
the life you've always wanted
with the woman you love?
Audrey.
There she is, Nathan.
Everything you've ever wanted.
And I'm giving her to you.
You want to give me a copy of Audrey?
One that loves you with all her heart.
I'll take you both outside the shroud,
set you up in a new life
far away from here.
Neither one of you will remember Haven.
Nathan, I'm offering you a fresh start.
Why?
Why would you do this?
Oh, Dove,
what is coming...
It'll be such a wonderful time for us.
You don't have to worry about Nathan.
This way you know he's taken
care of, that he's happy.
You think that copy can make me happy?
I assure you you will never know
or be able to tell the difference.
Well, if she's so perfect,
why don't you just keep her for yourself?
I said you would never know the difference.
I'm her father. I would know.
You think I would abandon Audrey
for some illusion?
I belong here in Haven
with Audrey, fighting you.
What do you want, Duke?
Question is, what do you want, Dwight?
Right now I want to kill you
for murdering my friends
and betraying us to Croatoan.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
Do you have a second choice,
like, perhaps, raising your daughter?
My daughter's dead.
No. She's right in there.
- That's not Lizzie.
- Are you sure?
Croatoan used a very special
trouble to bring her back.
He must really like you.
Yeah. Why did he send you here, Duke?
What does Croatoan want?
The controller crystal.
What makes him think I have it?
He knows that you have it.
The crystal isn't here.
Then go and get it.
Deliver it to Croatoan, and
he will let you keep Lizzie.
I think you know me better than that, Duke.
Then he will come for her.
Or maybe he'll just send me.
Where's Lizzie?
Upstairs.
What did Duke want?
He said Lizzie's some kind
of gift from Croatoan,
an example of his power.
He's going to let you keep her?
I'm not even sure she is a her.
I mean, come on, Vince, she
can't really be my daughter.
I see the way you look at her, Dwight.
It's not just that child.
A part of you has been
brought back to life here.
Losing Lizzie...
watching those bullets tear
into her, it was like dying.
For a long time, I wanted to die.
Thought about ending it, a lot.
I know.
I was afraid for you.
It took so long to crawl out of that hole.
I can't go through that again.
I know.
And to this day, I feel responsible.
I led the Guard.
They were my men who shot Lizzie.
I couldn't make it right back then.
I can never make it right.
How terribly ironic if Croatoan can.
I can't believe I let you
involve Intern in all of this.
What if Croatoan finds out
she's helping you and sends Duke after her?
If my trouble can fix it,
you know I have to try, Gloria.
Yeah, well, it doesn't
mean I have to like it.
It's really good, Vickie.
When I'm done, if we fold it here,
the crack in the core should close.
And then we will give it to Vince,
and finally we can build a new Barn.
Get rid of Croatoan.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Stick with the paper, kid.
They never see it coming.
Got a few more security cameras going.
Perimeter looks good.
Nathan.
We...
I think we might need to
talk about something.
Ah.
I'm not leaving you.
Croatoan's offer has to be a little...
tempting.
You're asking me if I
want all this to be over,
live behind some white picket fence,
adopt a shelter dog?
Of course I do.
But I want that with the
real Audrey Parker,
not some copy.
You wouldn't even remember
that she wasn't real.
How can I claim to love you as much as I do
if I don't at least give you that chance?
Your asking me to consider this is exactly
the reason why I never, never could.
Vickie's almost done with the core.
We are gonna beat Croatoan, save Duke,
and get our lives back.
Yeah.
Laverne, do you have something?
Duke.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Where did they run to, Laverne?
You can play all the games you want.
I'm getting what I came for.
Vickie, you have been very, very busy.
Still warm, Nathan.
Okay, what do we do now?
Well, we can't stay here.
Why? We're 3 feet above the lava.
We need to rescue the princess
before the dragon gets her.
I thought you were the princess.
No, silly, I'm Lizzie the Lionhearted,
and you're Dwight the Dauntless.
It's how we always play.
Right. Right. Okay.
Well, we need some stepping stones.
- Here goes nothing.
- Hang on.
We made it. Did we rescue the princess?
Yes, but you melted your feet.
Oh.
Darn.
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty.
Dad, we played last week.
Lizzie...
That was a lot of fun.
There's some milk and
cookies in the kitchen.
- I'd say we deserve them.
-
She has no idea she died?
No, but she remembers everything else.
She even called herself
Lizzie the Lionhearted.
How could she know that?
Have you noticed anything
different about her?
Not yet. But the cookies...
- The cookies are a test.
- A test?
It's been a thing for her
since her mother left.
I stocked that kitchen
with ten types of cookies.
If that's my daughter,
she'll bring out two types... her
favorite and her least favorite,
and they'll be arranged on
the plate like a flower.
Oh.
Milk and cookies, Mr. Teagues.
What a polite young lady.
Thank you, Lizzie.
How's it going, Vickie?
- Almost there.
- Hurry.
Laverne may have been able to
move this wall to hide us,
but Duke won't be fooled for long.
Or fooled at all.
Duke knows this place like the
back of his hand, poor kid.
Finished.
Good.
So if you fold it,
the core should be able
to fuse together, right?
- Nathan.
- Duke.
Stop.
Don't make me shoot.
Duke.
Go.
We have to get the core fixed.
Laverne, slow him down.
I want that drawing, Vickie.
Oh, Jesus.
Duke, please. This isn't you.
Oh, this is me, just with improvements.
The Duke I know stands up
to bullies like Croatoan.
You don't want to hurt Vickie.
I should've killed you
when you were a statue.
Go.
- The Aether core.
- Got it.
No.
You don't.
Ah.
No.
I always liked your trouble, Vickie.
I can't wait to try it out.
Oh, is it your turn now?
You going to tell me how
much I mean to you?
How we're family?
No.
No?
Hundreds and hundreds of
your little speeches...
"trouble whispering"
all of your little lambs.
You must have something special
in your bag of trick for me.
I'm not going to tell you
what you already know,
that what you're doing is wrong.
I'm not going to beg for our lives, Duke.
Don't be so melodramatic.
Croatoan wants you alive.
Nathan too, for now.
As long as the old lady
doesn't get in my way,
I will take the artiste and go.
- I will not let you kill Vickie.
- Oh, I see.
You'll only let me kill when
it serves your purpose.
Well, I don't work for you anymore.
You never worked for us.
No, Duke's right.
We used you.
I used you.
When we found out about
the Crocker family curse,
about what it could do,
I used that as a tool to stop the Troubles
because that's what I was sent here to do.
But I didn't think about how
much it was going to hurt you,
how killing all of those people, how...
how it would change you.
It didn't change anything.
This was always meant to be.
I don't think it was.
I think you were fighting your destiny.
And if left alone, maybe
you might have even won.
But I didn't know that.
And I came along, and I
sent you on that path.
And for that, I am truly sorry.
I know how it feels, Duke,
to be fighting to be the person
that you want to be when everyone
is telling you to be someone else.
Croatoan thinks that I'm his daughter.
I-I look like her.
I sound like her.
Do you know how easy it
would be to just say,
"Sure,
it's good to see you, Dad,"
and stop being scared?
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired of fighting my destiny.
But I can't give up.
Because when I look in the mirror,
I only see me.
I see the person that I truly am.
The only person I want to be.
So tell me, Duke, when
you look in the mirror,
when no one else is around,
who are you?
I'm Duke Crocker.
And I just want to go
back to being a pirate.
Yes.
Time to eat your peanut butter.
I already ate mine.
Yuck.
Maybe we shouldn't eat the
cookies we don't like.
But we always do it that way.
You have to eat the yucky one.
Why, Lizzie?
Why do we always eat a
cookie we don't like?
'Cause that's how life is.
Sometimes it hands you a bad cookie,
like when you got hurt in the Army
or when Mom left us.
But if you hang in there,
the good cookies will come, right?
Right, like how we still have each other.
Like how we still have each other.
Hey.
Welcome back, kiddo.
Glad to be back.
I knew you could beat him.
Yeah, not soon enough.
We have to make sure
that Croatoan doesn't find out about you.
Is there any way that you
can use your phasing trouble
to get out of town?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going to kill Croatoan.
No. No way.
You're not going anywhere near him.
Nathan, the things that he made me do,
the people I killed, the friends I hurt,
what I did to the both of you...
He's trying to split you up.
He knows you are stronger together.
Please, you have to let me help.
I need to make things right.
You will.
I promise.
But we have to be careful.
If Croatoan gets a hold of
one of your Troubles...
What? What's wrong?
He knows.
Croatoan knows.
He's taking them. I can't stop him.
What can we do?
There's got to be something that we can do.
There is.
You have to kill me.
You have to kill me. Now.
Before he takes any more.
There has to be another way.
There isn't.
Duke...
Whenever a Crocker has died,
the Troubles stayed with them.
If I'm dead,
Croatoan has no way of collecting them.
No, Duke.
I can't.
Yes, you can, Nathan.
You can to save Haven, to save Audrey.
No. No, not like this.
Look, I'd do it myself, right?
I'd go up to the roof and jump.
But if I break open and
bleed out all my Troubles,
then I died for nothing.
Croatoan took everything from me.
I have to take something back.
I have to choose my destiny.
I have to show Croatoan that
Duke Crocker's nobody's bitch.
So please.
Please.
Come on, please.
Please!
Gloria?
No, I'm sorry, Duke.
Do you see that?
Who knows which one that was?
You have no idea the horrible Troubles
that I've taken inside of me.
And if I let Croatoan
get them, then he wins.
That's not my destiny.
That's not me.
No.
Nathan, please.
I can't do it myself.
There's no time.
I know.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Nathan.
Hey.
Duke, it's gonna be okay, all right?
We love you.
You are the bravest man I ever met,
Duke Crocker, you always have been.
So much we've done together.
So much we never could've done without you.
I owe you so much.
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to repay that debt.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
What Duke became wasn't who he was.
No, and in the end, it's what saved us.
Maybe all of Haven.
It stopped Croatoan from
getting his Troubles.
The Aether core, it's destroyed.
There will be no way to build a new Barn,
no way to end the Troubles.
Dwight, maybe you can just help me
get him to the truck.
We'll put him on ice until we can give him
a proper burial at sea with Jennifer.
He would like that.
Yeah.
At sea.
I'm gonna take a walk. Be back in a minute.
Oh, Dwight, glad you came.
That makes one of us.
Difficult decision, I'm sure.
You brought the crystal?
The crystal's useless now.
Why do you even want it?
Useless to you.
I can do wonders with the
technology behind it.
What do you mean?
This room is similar to the
one my daughter grew up in.
I intend to make an exact
copy of this entire house.
You want to rebuild a house?
Not a house, a home.
When Audrey joins me,
we'll live here together, and
we'll be a family once again.
Without Charlotte, of course.
Because you murdered her.
Charlotte betrayed me.
She had me banished.
Then she tried to poison Mara with lies.
Then she killed her.
Mara was evil.
Like father, like daughter.
But Charlotte...
Charlotte was good in the sack.
Yeah, she had that going for her.
You know, Dwight,
you're lucky that I have
other concerns right now.
You've seen what I can do with people
who try to take what's mine.
So...
the crystal or Lizzie?
Which are you gonna bring me?
Are you really going to walk away?
I'm giving you a second chance
with your daughter, Dwight.
I, more than anyone, know
how remarkable that can be.
Are you really going to walk away from it?
I'll be back in a few hours.
With the crystal.
You made the right choice, Dwight.
You all have.
Thanks, Laverne.
I needed that.
Laverne, what is it?
Is some... Is something wrong?
Good, Nathan's back.
Laverne, where is he going?
Try to follow him.
No.
Where are they going?
Last time it was the carrot,
so I assume you're here with a stick.
There's that wry sense
of humor the girls love.
Mara thought William was hilarious.
I thought he was a moron.
What do you want?
To offer my condolences.
Shame about Duke.
The Crockers grew so
cowardly over the years.
Duke died so you wouldn't get
any of his Troubles.
He died a hero.
He walked away from greatness.
Have you thought any more about my offer?
No.
My future's here.
Not without Audrey, it isn't.
What have you done with Audrey?
Where is she?
Audrey is going to be exactly
where she belongs...
By her father's side, which means you...
Need to leave Haven.
I knew you'd come here, someplace familiar.
If you need to talk...
What have you done with Nathan?
If you've hurt him...
Hurt him?
Nathan told me he had said his good-byes.
His good-byes?
What does that mean?
Before he left with your copy.
I thought you knew. I'm so sorry.
No.
No, that's not true.
I'm afraid it is.
Nathan is...
beyond the shroud.
Parker.
Nathan.
This is weird.
Yeah.
What can I get you two?
Uh, actually maybe you could tell me,
did you see us come in?
Oh, things get so busy
around here sometimes,
all I see are hash browns.
But...
now that I come to think of it,
I could've sworn this table was empty,
and then I turned around,
and there you were.
Ah, maybe we all need a cup of coffee?
- Sugar.
- Black.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
At least we're together.
We'll figure it out.
Yeah.
We always do.
Nathan told me he changed his mind.
The tragedy of having to kill his friend...
He realized the futility of fighting me.
No.
Nathan never would've left
of his own free will.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
He begged me to take him away from Haven.
He said that saving the world
had become too exhausting.
I know you're upset.
But really, isn't this what you want?
Nathan far away
from the terrible dangers
he would've faced?
Dangers?
Well, once we begin our experiments,
there will be a lot of trial and error.
Things will become...
volatile.
No. I'm not helping you.
This is what you were meant to do.
Nathan abandoned you.
But not me.
I will never abandon you.
You don't have to be so morose.
Attitude is the paintbrush
that colors our world.
What we're about to do will be wonderful.
What is that?
Mm, the question is, what is behind that?
I'm using an abrasion trouble
to create an opening to the Void.
Why is it...
Turning black?
It's filling with Aether.
And soon it will rain,
and then you and I will begin our work.
And it won't seem like work
because we'll have casual Friday,
we'll have music, bring dogs.
Take a few hours before
there's enough Aether
and we can get to work, so...
go grieve,
make your peace,
do whatever you have to do to move on,
because Nathan
is gone.
Your life
is with me, here,
now.
