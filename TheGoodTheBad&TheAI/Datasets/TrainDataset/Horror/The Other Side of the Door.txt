MICHAEL: People are
throwing colored powder
and buckets of
water at each other
and I keep getting hit in
the face with this stuff.
So, I mean, at this point,
I must look like some kind of crazy clown.
And all the while,
we're trying to carry on
this incredibly
serious discussion
about antique furniture.
And he's telling
me about this piece
that he's found that
he thinks I might like.
And then,
out of nowhere, he says...
I'm pregnant.
Seriously?
It is beautiful.
It's crazy.
Oh, baby, I don't
want to go back.
What if we stayed here?
Started a family here.
Are you serious?
Why not?
I'm going to have to come three times
a year to source antiques anyway.
What's to keep us from
setting up our base here?
What do you think?
I don't know.
This yours?
Hey.
What are you saying?
I'm asking her if you and I
should stay here forever.
How can you sleep?
Ow!
So peacefully!
Whoa, whoa.
Sweetheart, stop. Stop.
It's okay,
it's okay, I'm here.
It's not okay.
Stop it, stop it.
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.
I got you.
It's okay, I got you.
LUCY: Winston, come on.
Winston.
Good boy! Good boy.
Come on, boy.
Come on, Winston.
MICHAEL: Lucy.
Come on.
Morning, sweetheart.
Morning.
How did you sleep?
Good.
MICHAEL: Morning, Piki.
Morning, sir.
MARIA: Michael.
Yeah, what's up?
I am...
Hey, you don't have
to say anything, okay?
I'm lost, Michael.
I don't know if I can live with it.
We're going to be fine.
We'll get through this.
Maria?
Hello?
Mrs. Harwood retired early
for the night, sir.
She had a migraine.
I put Lucy to bed.
Right.
Okay.
Night, sir.
Night-night, Piki.
MARIA:
Wrists up like
there's an orange.
And a one, two,
a one, two, three, four!
MICHAEL:
MARIA:
LUCY:
MICHAEL: You guys are fantastic!
Was that really you playing?
It was too good. You sure
it wasn't Mommy?
MICHAEL: You're telling me it
was really you playing?
MICHAEL: Can't believe it!
My children are geniuses. Yeah.
MARIA: They worked on it
all day just for you.
We're going to
get through this.
Maria?
Maria!
Maria! Open your
eyes, sweetheart.
Can you hear me? Maria?
I need you to listen
to my voice, please.
Sweetheart, I need
you to focus, okay?
I need you to
fight this. Please!
Maria, I can't
live without you.
OLIVER: Mommy!
Please help me.
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy, I can't get free!
My leg's stuck!
Luce?
Lucy. No, no, no.
Lucy, please wake up, baby.
Mommy, get me out!
Lucy, please wake up!
No, no, no!
Mommy, I can't get free!
It hurts!
Please get me out!
Okay, okay.
Please wake up.
I'm scared! I know you're scared!
I'm scared, too! Pull!
Okay? Oliver, come on.
I don't care if it hurts,
you have to pull. You have to pull!
I know it hurts.
You have to pull.
Keep your nose up.
Keep your nose all the way up.
Keep your nose on the ceiling.
We're all going to be okay.
Okay. Okay.
Baby.
I don't know what to do.
OLIVER: Please don't leave me!
MARIA: I'm sorry, baby.
OLIVER:  Mommy!
We need help! Please.
Please, somebody!
We need help!
My boy's in the car!
My boy's in the car! Please!
No! No! My boy!
Ollie!
No, my boy's in the car!
We need to get my boy!
Ollie!
Ollie!
DOCTOR: Michael.
Yeah.
She's going to be fine.
But she took a lot of pills.
PIKI: You are in
Bombay Hospital.
Where's Michael?
He's talking
to the doctor.
You are lucky to be
alive, Mrs. Harwood.
I just can't bear
life without him.
I had a daughter once.
Anushka.
She fell into a pond while
trying to pick some plants.
I was looking away
for only one minute.
What if I could bring your son
back to you just one more time?
What if I could give you the
chance to say your final goodbye?
What are you talking about?
I was born in
a village in South India.
Surrounding our village
was a big forest.
And deep within
this forest
there was an abandoned temple.
It is said that the line between the
world of the dead and the living
is very thin
at this place.
You should go there.
Take the ashes
of your son,
spread them on the
steps of this temple,
lock yourself inside,
and when night comes,
he will come to you.
And you will be
able to talk to him
through the door
of the temple,
say your final goodbye.
I will leave
you two alone.
MICHAEL: I was so
scared I lost you.
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
LUCY: Come on.
Come on, boy.
If we do this,
you have to promise
me one thing.
When Oliver comes
to you at the temple,
you will be able
to speak to him.
But no matter
what you do,
no matter what he says or
how much ever he pleads,
you must not open the door.
Promise me.
I promise.
It has been too long.
Let me go.
Khan.
PIKI: They are the Aghori.
They live by
the cremation sites.
They cover
themselves in the ashes
and they feed off
the flesh of the dead.
For they believe it helps them
communicate with the other side.
My village is the last stop,
then follow my instructions.
God, Michael.
I will give him your note.
No, he's going to be frantic,
and Lucy needs to know where I am.
I will take
care of everything.
MARIA: Dear Michael,
please don't be worried.
I'm just taking a couple of
days to sort my head out.
I desperately want to
find a way to move on
so that we can
be a family again.
I love you and
Lucy so, so much.
I love you so much.
Who's there?
Oliver?
Who are you?
Oliver?
Mommy?
Mommy, is that you?
Oliver, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Yes, I can hear you.
Where am I, Mommy?
Baby, press yourself close.
Come up right against the
door and press yourself close
so we can be
close together, okay?
Are you there?
Yes, Mommy.
Oliver, I miss you.
I miss you so much, baby.
You know I love you, right?
More than life itself.
I miss you, too.
I miss Daddy and Lucy.
Oliver, Momma has
something to tell you.
I came here because
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for leaving you.
It wasn't
your fault.
I love you, Mommy.
MARIA: Baby,
I think about you day and night.
I wish I could
hold you in my arms.
OLIVER: The door won't open.
I can't get in.
I know, baby.
I'm not allowed to let you in.
OLIVER: It's dark out here.
I want to come in.
MARIA: I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
Please, Mommy, open the door.
I want to hug you.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay to cry.
Mommy's crying, too.
I have to go now, Mommy.
What?
I have to go
back now, Mommy.
No!
No, you just got here.
No, please.
Baby, no, don't go.
Don't go. I just want
a few more minutes, okay?
Just a few more minutes, baby.
Please. Please, Oliver!
Where are you?
Ollie?
Oliver!
Oliver!
I love you, baby.
Maria?
Maria?
Maria.
There's nobody out here.
Quiet! Buddy,
what's wrong with you?
Relax.
Are you all right?
Hey, sweetheart.
What are you doing up?
Is Mommy home?
No, not yet.
She will be soon.
Let's get you back
to bed. Come on.
LUCY: How much tea
would you like?
That's not how
you're supposed to drink tea.
You're supposed to
drink tea like this.
Khan?
Where did you come from?
LUCY: Mommy!
Hello.
I missed you
so much.
I missed you, too.
Stop it!
That tickles!
Lucy, let's get
Winston a snack.
Come.
Come on, Winston.
Come.
I was worried sick.
Where were you?
I was trying to get better.
You couldn't have...
We would have come with you.
I know, I know.
Hey, I'm back.
I'm really back.
I'm back for you.
I'm back for Lucy.
MICHAEL: What's going on?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just Winston.
I got him.
Come on, you.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
Momma's here now.
Miss Lucy?
Where are you?
LUCY:
Hello, Mommy.
What you doing
in here, Luce?
Just playing
with my dolls.
And who were
you talking to?
Just my dolls.
Okay.
Well, you know that Momma doesn't
like people playing up here, right?
So how about we
go back downstairs?
Okay, Mommy.
MARIA: Scoot, scoot, scoot.
LUCY: Mommy, are you coming?
Yeah, I'll be
right there, babe.
Miss Lucy, that sounds...
Hey, Luce, where
did you get Khan?
Hey.
Hey, look at me, Luce.
I have something to show you,
but it's a secret.
Lucy, I need you to tell me
where you got the tiger, okay?
Did Piki give him to you?
Look, Mommy.
Lucy, please stop.
Lucy.
Lucy, I need to
talk to you about...
Oliver's come back, Mommy.
Nighty-night,
sleep you tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
You won't tell Daddy,
will you?
About Oliver.
Why do you say that, love?
I think Oliver's hiding.
Who's he hiding from?
He doesn't want to tell me.
Just don't tell Daddy.
Well, what if we wait until
Oliver's ready to tell him?
Promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Get some sleep.
I love you.
Good night.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
And don't let
the bedbugs bite.
Okay.
Okay, let's see
where we left off.
"Directly in front of him,
"holding on by a low branch,
"stood a naked brown baby
who could just barely walk,
"as soft and as
dimpled a little atom
"as ever came to
a wolf's cave at night."
Whoa.
Hey, sweetheart.
I was just coming
to find you.
Did I miss saying
good night to Luce?
Oh, it's okay.
I kissed her good night for you.
Okay.
Sorry I was late.
Mmm. It's okay.
Are you all right?
You're trembling.
I don't know.
What's going on?
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm good.
I'm really, really good.
Good.
OLIVER: Hello?
Hello?
OLIVER: Hello?
Oliver, where are you?
MICHAEL: What's going on?
What happened?
What happened, baby?
Are you all right?
It's a dream. Just a dream.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
LUCY: Mommy!
Mommy!
MARIA: What is it, baby?
Chil and Bill
are dead.
What?
Oh, no,
I'm so sorry.
The gardener found all the
fish dead in the pond.
And all the plants are dying.
Can we bury Chil
and Bill in the sea?
In the sea?
Piki said people in India
get buried in the sea.
Of course. Yes, we can.
How about you go get
something to bury them in?
LUCY: You should
have worn white.
MARIA: I wore a white scarf.
That's not enough?
LUCY: No.
MARIA: I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude to Chil and Bill.
It's a good spot right here.
LUCY: Bye-bye, Chil.
Bye-bye, Bill.
Mommy, who's that man?
It's all right, baby.
He's far away.
Not that man, Mommy!
That man!
Why did that man
put ash on your face?
I don't know, love.
Did I get it all?
Yeah, you got it.
Yeah?
Luce, stay behind me.
Oliver?
Oliver, do you want to play?
VOICE 1:  Are you coming out
to play, Stanley?
VOICE 2:
Someone painted
the wall pink...
VOICE 3:  Detective Calamity
at your service, sir.
VOICE 4:
What is it, Winston?
VOICE 3:  Sounds like you
need a detective.
Look at you.
Right where you belong.
Okay, baby girl.
Let's get those nits out.
I don't have nits.
Nits like clean hair.
Daddy told me.
Okay, well, then you certainly
don't have them, Grumpy-stiltskin.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Come on,
come on, come on.
Lucy, what
happened to your shoulder?
I don't think I
like Oliver anymore.
He's mean.
Oliver, I saw those
bite marks on Lucy.
You can't hurt your
sister, all right?
I said "no".
Oliver, you let me out.
Okay.
I'll read to you.
As long as you promise
not to hurt Lucy again.
Will you promise me?
"Shere Khan moved
through the forest.
"He heard the thunder
of their hooves,
"and lumbered
down the ravine,
"looking from side to side
for any way of escape."
Hello?
MICHAEL:
How was your day?
Did you have fun with Luce?
MARIA: Yeah, I just
put her to bed.
Okay.
I'm really sorry, but I've got to
be here for a couple more hours.
Shall I ask Piki to keep something warm
for you or are you going to eat there?
I'm just going to
grab something here.
But I just wanted
to tell you that I miss you.
MARIA:
All right. I love you.
Give Luce a kiss for me.
Bye.
Oliver?
I see you there.
I'll call the police!
Go on!
Go. Go!
Get out! Get out of my house!
PIKI: You have no idea
what you have done.
Did you think that
you could bring back
somebody from
the world of the dead
and they would be the same?
Did you think there would
be no consequences?
I don't understand.
Hindus believe in the purification
and reincarnation of the soul.
That can never
happen to Oliver now
because he has
returned to this life.
Instead, his soul
will putrefy.
You have seen her,
haven't you?
Myrtu.
She is getting closer to
this world every day.
When you opened the door,
you upset the balance
between life and death
and you awoke her.
She is the gatekeeper
of the underworld.
She is here to take Oliver
back to the world of the dead.
And she will destroy anything
that comes in her way.
Oliver is no longer your son,
Mrs. Harwood.
Do you understand
what I am telling you?
He is evil.
Burn every possession of his.
Destroy every photograph.
Get rid of anything which is
an anchor for him to this life
and pray that he will return
to the world of the dead.
You are out of your mind.
I should never have told
you about the temple!
I thought I was
trying to help you.
Lucy?
Baby.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Lucy?
LUCY: Mommy.
You woke me up.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yes.
Come on. I've got to
get dry.
I just think it would
be a really good idea.
I can't remember the last time
Lucy saw her cousins.
I know. It would
be amazing.
I would love that.
I'm just not sure it's the best
timing for business, but...
You are always saying that you
never have any time to relax.
You know, she's got a month
before she starts school...
and we haven't been to
the States for so long.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah? You seem
kind of flushed.
I'm just coming down
with something. Luce!
Luce?
Lucy?
Luce?
Lucy?
Lucy!
I'll go look for her out front.
Luce?
MICHAEL: Lucy?
LUCY: Mommy!
Lucy!
Luce!
Lucy!
Luce!
Lucy!
LUCY: Mommy!
Lucy!
MICHAEL: Maria!
Hey.
Michael! Where were you?
She was just out front.
I tried to tell you, but you'd run off.
I couldn't find you.
I know you're there.
Oliver, stop it!
Anushka?
Look, Mommy.
It's Oliver's book.
Thank you.
MICHAEL: What is this?
I'm not sure.
Maria? Maria!
MARIA: Michael!
What?
MARIA: Lucy, come here.
MICHAEL: Stay there.
I got you. It's okay.
What is it, Mommy?
MARIA: It's okay.
"And when the drawbridge
closed with a bang
"all the people
were safe inside.
"And deep in the dark forest
the dragon curled up in a heap
"and went to sleep."
I think you can curl up in a
heap and go to sleep now.
You don't think that Oliver
did that to Piki, do you?
No.
No, I think what
happened to Piki
was just a terrible,
terrible accident.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am.
Now, how about
you hop into bed?
Been a long day, little one.
Can Winston sleep
with me tonight?
I suppose that's a yes, isn't it?
Do not hog all the bed.
Have sweet dreams.
I love you.
Is Piki in heaven now?
I think so, yes.
Why isn't Oliver in heaven?
It's time for
bed, sweet girl.
I'll see you in the morning.
Lucy?
Baby, are you all right?
Luce?
Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy?
Luce!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Luce?
Are you in here?
Baby, are you hiding from...
No, no, no.
No, no!
Lucy?
Luce.
Oh, my God, sweet girl.
You scared me.
So much.
What are you
doing out here, baby?
I wanted to feel
the wind on my skin.
It tickles.
Okay.
Okay, come on,
let's go to bed.
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
Daddy!
Hey, you.
What are you doing out
here so late, pumpkin?
I think she might have
been sleepwalking.
I missed you, Daddy.
I missed you,
too, sweetheart.
How about we get
you back to bed? Come on.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, too...
What...
What? No, no, no.
Michael.
Michael.
No. No!
MARIA: Michael.
It's got to burn.
It's got to burn.
What? Why?
Because Oliver came back.
What?
Oliver came back,
and I think he killed Piki.
Because she tried to burn all
of his things to send him back
because he's not
our boy anymore.
Stop.
Darling, stop.
I know it sounds absolutely crazy,
but it's true.
Right, Luce? Right?
I don't know what you're
talking about, Mommy.
No, no, baby,
it's okay. It's okay.
We can tell Daddy now.
Tell him about your brother.
Tell him about the piano.
Tell him about the piano.
I don't know what you're saying.
Oliver's dead.
Luce, I don't know why you're
doing this right now, okay?
But you need to tell
your father the truth.
You need to tell him.
I don't know what
you mean, Mommy.
Lucy, you have to tell him!
Enough! Enough!
You're scaring her.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...
It's all right.
Let's get you to bed,
sweetheart.
All right.
You feel better, poppet?
Now that you're here, Daddy.
You sleep well, okay?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Lucy, please tell
Daddy about Oliver.
Maria, sweetheart,
you're not thinking straight.
Can we talk about this downstairs?
I'm not making it up.
I understand you don't think
you're making it up, but I...
What?
Oliver, what have you done?
Maria?
He's possessed her.
Maria, would you
listen to yourself?
No, no, no!
Oliver?
Maria.
We can be together again.
You leave your sister alone!
Daddy, I'm scared!
Stop!
Come here, sweetheart.
It's going to be all right.
MARIA: Michael.
You need help.
I'm going to get
you the help you need,
and everything is
going to be okay.
Okay. Are you all right,
sweetheart?
LUCY: Mommy was hurting me.
MICHAEL: No, no.
Mommy's just not herself right now.
But she loves you very much.
And so do I.
LUCY: Where are we going?
MICHAEL: We're going
on a little adventure.
What do you want?
Okay.
Just stay here. I'm going
to make a quick call, okay, sweetheart?
Everything's
going to be fine.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Hello. Hi.
Yes, okay, my address
is Dobra Villa,
Carter Road, in Bandra.
Yes, there's a group of
men outside my house
and I think they're trying to
break in and get my daughter
I'm not sure,
but I need help immediately.
Bad dog.
MICHAEL: Yes. Yes.
As fast as you can.
Quiet.
MICHAEL: I don't know,
but they're naked almost.
Okay, please hurry. Yes.
Lucy, what...
Oh, my God. Baby.
What did you do?
Winston was being naughty.
So I had to
teach him a lesson.
You're not going to
be naughty as well
are you, Daddy?
No!
LUCY: It's just
Mommy and me now.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You're making a mess
all over the kitchen floor.
Mommy will be mad.
Lucy, what are you doing?
I'm not Lucy. I'm Oliver.
No.
But I am!
Michael?
Michael.
Michael?
Oliver!
Help me, Mommy!
Help me, Mommy!
Leave her alone!
Lucy!
Mommy.
Lucy!
Baby!
MARIA: Luce!
Lucy!
No!
Lucy!
No!
Oliver, you leave Lucy
and you come to me.
You come to me.
Do you hear me?
I don't want to go back.
I know. I know.
But I'll go with you.
All right?
You'll be safe. You're safe.
I've got you. I've got you.
Take me instead.
No!
No! No!
Maria!
No!
Let me go!
No!
Mommy!
MICHAEL:
Michael?
Maria, can you hear me?
Michael, where are you?
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I can't believe I
can hear your voice.
Sweetheart?
Maria?
Can you hear me?
Darling, please,
I need to see you.
Michael?
Please, where are you?
No.
Sweetheart, can you hear me?
No.
Please, I need to see you.
Michael.
I need to see your face.
No!
No!
