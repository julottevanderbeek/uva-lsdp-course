There's a trading post 35 miles
northeast of here in the great plateau.
Ten miles north of that
is a landing strip.
We can have the film pouched out to
Delphi, then send it on to Calcutta.
Old Jonesy should be happy.
We're only two weeks late.
This has been such a wonderful adventure.
You made it wonderful.
Mark it down in your book.
September, the Amazon. July, Egypt. Okay?
But in the next five minutes, bed.
-
-
No!
No!
-
-
Ready, boy? Come on. Come get it!
Come on. You want the ball, Thor?
You want the ball? Yeah, come on.
Hey, you ready, Thor?
Come on, go get it! Go get it!
Bring it back, Thor.
Come on, Thor, come here!
Hey Thor, come here, give me the ball.
Hey Thor, come here!
Come back here, Thor!
Come on, give me the ball.
Thor, come here!
I'm going to get you, boy!
Where you going, boy?
Where's the ball?
Nice doggy.
-
-
Nice doggy.
You're a big one, aren't ya?
Are you a dog or a horse?
It's not a horse. It's a German Shepherd.
Yeah?
Well, he's a hell of a big
German Shepherd, ain't he?
May I help you?
- You must be the lady of the house?
- Yes, I am.
I see you got a young boy here.
Now, you help him
get the best education possible?
Because I represent the Pacific
Northwest Magna Reading Project
and we have a series of books
which studies have proved
are a major benefit towards
advanced learning in
phonetics and word comprehension.
Now, if I could have just five minutes
of your valuable time to show you
this exquisite series, I'm sure
you won't be disappointed.
Thank you very much,
but we're really not interested
- in buying anything right now.
- No, please. Please.
Let me show you these books
my company has developed, all right?
I have them right...
- ...here.
-
- Whoa, whoa, lady, whoa!
- Thor!
Whoa, you ever heard of a leash law?
Jeez, want to control that dog
before it bites somebody?
-
- Thor!
Hey, Thor!
- Hey, get off him, Thor!
- Get him off me!
Hey, go to the house!
Go to the house, go on!
- Are you okay?
- No, he bit me!
- Jesus!
- Where did he bite you?
You've got a dangerous animal there, lady.
I'm suing.
You better get hold of a lawyer
right away, lady,
because you're gonna hear
from mine, toot sweet!
You can talk to me.
I'm a lawyer.
Thor, sit and stay down!
Did he bite you?
Because if he did, you really
need to see a doctor right away.
Since you're on foot, I'll drive you
to the hospital emergency room myself.
In fact, why don't I take you
to my own family doctor?
No, no, no, I got my own doctor.
All right.
I've heard about enough, Flopsy.
Who's Flopsy, mom?
A flopsy, Brett, is a con man
who does things like
throw himself in front of cars
and pretend to get hit
or intentionally provoke people's
dogs and pretend to get bitten.
He threatens to sue people
or have their pets destroyed
if they don't pay him money.
I've prosecuted plenty of these guys.
- Yeah, well, then I'll see you in court.
- Brett, why don't you call Sheriff Bragg.
Tell him you're my son.
He'll take the call.
Tell him we got a little problem up here
and to send a deputy right away.
Well, Flopsy, it's been
really nice knowing you.
I guess I'll visit you in the slammer.
Oh, you..
Stay!
My advice is to you is to turn around and
walk away without saying another word
and without looking back.
Yeah? Well, you ain't
heard the last of this, lady.
Oh, I think I have.
But don't think of it as a total loss.
You learned a valuable lesson.
Do not mess with a lawyer on her own turf.
- Good night, Thor.
-
Lousy night shift.
Overtime.
Nah.
-
-
Hello?
Ted!
Hi, how are you?
Where are you?
You've been back that long
and you haven't called me?
You creep!
Of course, we'd love to see you!
Yeah, we'll be up to the lake
in a few hours.
I thought Uncle Ted
was in another country.
So did I.
He's been back three months
and he didn't even call me.
That flaky brother of mine!
Hey!
Hey, sis. How are you?
How are you?
Ever think of using that razor
I got you for Christmas?
Yeah, maybe to slit my throat.
God it's good to see you, Janet,
you don't know how good it is.
Oh, that's right, that's why
you've been back two months
and you don't call, you don't
tell me where you are, you don't...
You putz!
It's good to see you, too.
Hey Brett, look at you,
you shot up like a weed.
Uncle Ted, can I shoot the rifle?
Well, maybe we'd better
talk about that later, okay?
Come on, let's go in and visit.
So sis, how's it going at the new firm,
Janeway and Samuels?
So far, so good.
My caseload's a lot lighter
than it was in the DA's office in Chicago.
Pace is a lot easier.
And, frankly, I am so glad
to be out of criminal litigation.
How are you adjusting to small-town life?
For me, like that!
For Brett, it's not such
an easy adjustment, though.
He hasn't made any friends
in the neighborhood.
But Chicago's no place to raise kids.
Out here, it's safe and peaceful.
You know, sis, I'm so proud of you.
I really have to take my hat off to you.
You're a full-time mom to Brett and still
manage to work at the firm full-time.
It's just great.
Hey.
You're not telling me something.
Things haven't been going so good for me
since I got back from the jungle, sis.
Marjorie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so now it's just me and...
my shadow.
Whoa!
Oh, man.
What?
Whoa.
-
-
Thor!
Don't do that to me!
Good dog, Thor.
Oh, shoot!
- I haven't seen him.
- I wouldn't worry about him.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Thor.
Come say hello to your Uncle Ted, Thor.
That's our Thor. Overprotective.
Maybe if he saw you more...
Come.
Come come.
We're two of a kind, aren't we, old pal?
What did you do, spit in his Alpo?
He knows an old dog when he sees one.
Hey, you guys better get moving
if you want to get him home by bedtime.
You have a long ride ahead of you, sis.
I want you to stay with us for a while.
I didn't realize how late it was,
come on, I'll walk you to the car.
I mean it, I'm worried about you.
Don't worry about me, come on.
- Just say yes.
- Yes.
Good. You're coming with us.
No, but I'll come by soon.
When?
- I'll call you.
- This week.
- This week.
- Good.
Come on.
- Come on, Thor!
-
- Hello?
- Sis?
Hey, Ted, how are you doing?
Yeah, you know...
having you up here was really great, sis.
It really lifted my spirits a lot.
Frankly, sis,
you know,
it's everything.
It's everything.
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciated
your guy's trip up here and...
family...
It's all we've got, sis.
Is there a problem up there?
Problem?
Up here?
No, no problem at all.
Just, uh,
having you here, like I said...
really lifted my spirits.
I reckon maybe you're right.
So I was thinking if
it's not an imposition...
maybe I can visit you for a few days.
Oh, Ted, you know
you're always welcome up here.
Here's what you're gonna do:
You're gonna park your
Airstream in the backyard
and you're gonna live out of my fridge.
Here's to family, sis.
And having you next door to me,
just like when we were kids.
It's perfect, just nice to be
out of the woods, all the memories.
I'm always right, little brother.
Yeah, it's really annoying.
Always has been.
Honestly, I'm glad you're here.
Me, too.
Hey, Thor, come on, get out of there!
Hey, hey, hey, Thor! Thor!
Handcuffs? Ted!
- Sis, it's not what you think.
- What are these?
"Maximum Security High-Tempered Steel."
- It's not what you think.
- Ooh, baby!
I think I better keep my eye on you.
It's gonna be real
interesting having you around.
Come on. I'm gonna make dinner.
No, thanks, I'm just gonna put on
my sweats and go for a run.
I'm gonna keep a low profile tonight.
If that's all right with you?
You can come and go as you please,
as long as you follow my rules.
Come on, Thor! Come on!
Good night, Thor.
What the hell?
What's going on?
Thor! What's wrong? What?
What?
Come on. You want to go outside?
Okay, go on, out, out!
Thor! Come here, boy!
Thor, where are you?
Thor!
Thor!
Thor, come on.
Hey, hey.
Good boy. Come on.
Let's go! Come on!
Come on!
What's with you? Hey!
What? What?
Let's go home. Okay?
You're such a baby.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Come on!
What? What's the deal with you?
Come on, we've got to go home.
Jesus, ever heard of sleep?
You crazy dog!
Come on.
You were at his funeral.
You had quite a long relationship
with your boyfriend, Darnelle.
We were together for three years.
Three years.
Thor!
Come on! Let's go!
Come on, you love baseball.
Where are you going?
Thor! Don't do that!
Come here, Thor.
Get over here, you knucklehead.
That wasn't very nice.
During the course of our show...
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special news bulletin.
Teams of hunters and police are patrolling
a 50-mile square area in Timberline
as the curfew enters its third day.
Police revealed today the shocking
discovery of a fifth dead hiker
in the woods near Timberline.
The five men and women were mutilated by
what authorities believe is a wild animal.
Possibly a grizzly bear.
Teams of hunters and bloodhounds
are patrolling a 50-mile square area
and a curfew is now in effect
on Timberline.
This is Sarah Williams reporting for KBDL.
Hi, Thor.
Come on, Thor.
Let's go.
Hey, Ted, good morning.
Good morning, sis.
Why didn't you tell me
about that curfew up in Timberline?
Those hikers who were killed?
That crazy animal that's loose up there?
I just saw it on TV.
There were police everywhere.
Oh, uh...
that, I uh,
I was going to tell you about it
this morning, sis.
Well, I guess this means you'll have to stay
until they lift the curfew, huh?
I guess.
So you want some breakfast?
Yeah, great.
Okay.
In good time, old boy.
In good time.
Hey!
It's not funny.
He's turning into the Wolfman.
I'm sorry, Brett, it's the full moon part.
In movies, the guy only turns
into a werewolf during the full moon.
Well, that's the way it works.
When there's a full moon,
he turns into the werewolf.
Everybody knows that.
Why only the full moon?
Why not any moon?
Well, because that's the way
a werewolf works.
You have to shoot him
with a silver bullet.
I bet if you blew his head off
with a shotgun it would do quite nicely.
Don't you know anything about werewolves?
I know you turn into one
if you get bit by one.
But the full moon part...
Maybe there's different
kinds of werewolves,
but it's been my experience
that any moon will do the trick.
Werewolf-wise.
Have you ever met a werewolf?
I've been acquainted with
a few in my time.
How about you?
Come on. Everybody knows
there's no such thing as werewolves.
Well...
There you go.
Brett, will you take the trash out
before breakfast, please?
- Aw, Mom.
- Don't "Aw, Mom," me. Go.
So, what all happened last night?
I don't know really.
Thor thought he heard something
in the woods, practically threw a fit.
Woke up the whole house.
Lucky you were in the Airstream.
Anyway, I finally let him out.
He ran out into the woods
and he didn't come back.
I tried calling him with that dog
whistle but he kept barking.
So?
What did he find?
Nothing.
What do you think it was all about?
I don't know, really.
I'm not that worried.
Thor barks at practically anything.
I don't know, Janet.
Big predators, they can travel a long
distance if their habitat runs dry.
Just because there hasn't been
anything dangerous in this forest recently
doesn't mean it's always gonna be safe.
If I were you, I wouldn't let Brett
play out there for awhile until...
Until what?
There weren't supposed to be
any wolves up where I am.
Look what happened to those people.
I thought they said it was a grizzly bear.
Janet, wolves, grizzly bears,
I mean it's the same difference!
All I'm saying is you have
to be a little more cautious.
Take the dog more seriously
and don't let him play out there.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
I mean Thor isn't
exactly helpless, you know.
Janet, how big is that dog?
Get this, he's 105 pounds.
Do you know how big a gray
wolf gets? Try 200 pounds!
Give me a break, Ted.
The dog starts barking at night
and all of a sudden you've got
a 200-pound wolf at the door!
Are you feeling okay?
Piss off.
Hey, Janet.
Could you take your dog
in the house, please!
I'd like to go for a run.
Come on, Thor.
Come on, it's bedtime!
Come on, Thor. Come on!
Thor, come on!
Thor, come on, it's bedtime! Come on in.
Come on.
Come on, come on. Good boy!
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
What's up with you?
Yeah, you be a good dog, huh?
You be a good dog.
Be a good dog.
Yeah, yeah, I love you, too.
Good night.
- Hey.
-
What's wrong, boy?
You want to go out?
-
-
Thor?
Hey, buddy.
Come here.
Come on.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, Thor.
Who cut you?
Oh, baby, who did this to you?
Come on, let's go clean you up.
Come on, it's okay.
It's all right. Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
It's okay, come on.
Hi.
Yeah, this is Janet Harrison,
Hi, Sheriff.
Ted? Are you in there?
Ted, you in here?
Ted?
Nice, Ted.
December 28, 1995.
Stateside.
Saw a doctor here.
Had blood test.
Doctor couldn't identify strain.
Some infection that isn't in the books.
Had another blackout last night.
Woke up in the woods.
December 29, 1995.
Blacked out again. Woke in the woods.
Blood on me.
Not mine.
May 18, 1996.
I have tried all medical
solutions to no effect.
There is no known cure in medicine...
but maybe...
just maybe, there's hope for me.
Janet and Brett came up to the lake today.
To see her again did my heart good.
She has invited me to stay with her.
Perhaps if I spend time with her,
with my family...
this disease will go into remission.
Medicine will not stave off this disease.
But perhaps love,
the restorative power of love,
family love...
will save me.
It's my last chance.
Nobody makes a fucking fool
out of me, lady.
Here, doggie.
Here, poochie, poochie.
-
-
Come here, you frigging stupid dog.
Nice doggie.
-
-
Sheriff, where have you been?
Is this the man who approached
your place last month?
Yeah, it is.
He's dead.
His name is Jerry Mills.
We found him on the road, a couple
hundred yards from your house.
He bore the marks of an animal attack.
He's been torn open
by a big animal like a wolf or...
Or a dog, is that it?
Yes, ma'am.
I do recall you told me the last time
Thor almost took a bite out of Mills.
Well, maybe last night when Mills
came back, Thor went at him again.
Thor got in a fight last night...
with something or...
someone.
He's got cuts all over him.
I see.
You know about these slayings
up in the Timberline area...
those hikers that were killed?
Yes, Janet.
That wouldn't be the same
animal that killed Mills.
It would've had to travel 200 miles
from Timberline to get here.
That's not what I mean.
My question is...
is it possible that...
they were committed by a human being?
No chance at all, Janet.
They were done by a big animal.
No man could tear a person apart the way
the beast that butchered those people did.
The same with Mills last night.
Wolves are the probable culprits.
Very, very big wolves, but not a man.
Not humanly possible.
Why did you ask?
I don't know.
I reckon that's all for now, Janet.
I'll be in touch.
Thanks.
Just one thing.
I know you love Thor.
And if he did tear up Mills,
he was doing so to protect you.
But once a dog becomes a biter,
gets a taste for human blood,
he becomes dangerous.
I suggest you consider
shopping for another hound.
Good morning, there, big guy.
How are you doing this morning?
Want to go outside, Thor, huh?
Want to go outside? Come on.
Right to the Airstream.
Where were you last night, Ted?
I went for a run.
All night?
You didn't see anything?
Hear anything?
-
-
Get him off me!
No! Don't!
Get in the trailer!
No, Thor! Stop it!
Get him off!
Thor, get off!
Thor, no!
Get in the house! I can't hold him back!
Thor! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Thor, come on! Bad dog! Bad dog!
Stop it, Thor! Come on! Calm down!
Get in there!
Come here, Thor.
Come on, sweetie. Come on.
Come on. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry.
Come on. Come on.
I'm sorry, babe.
- Go on, it's okay.
- Hold his head.
It's okay, Thor. Go on.
Okay. Good boy.
I got him.
Thor! Come back!
- Thor!
- Brett, come here. Come on, sweety.
They have to take him.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Don't go!
They'll kill him!
They have to take him, Brett.
He's dangerous!
No, it's not true, Mom! It's not true!
Thor!
Thor!
Let go!
Mom, they're going to kill him!
He's going to die!
Let go!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on! Come on!
I know.
It's okay.
It's probably genetic.
It happens with Shepherds.
It's the way they breed them.
Thor's pedigreed.
It doesn't happen to pedigrees.
You're gonna have to see a
doctor for that.
No, I won't. It's just a flesh wound.
No veins or tendons were cut.
Nothing I can't take care of.
You're gonna need a tetanus shot.
I can give myself a tetanus shot, Janet.
Excuse me a second.
I'm sorry about your dog, son.
Come here.
Come here!
There'll be other animals in your life.
Brett. It's time for bed.
I'll be right up.
I guess I'll turn in, too.
Ted.
Yes, Janet?
If I ask you a question...
will you tell me the truth?
Of course.
Where's Marjorie?
Seattle.
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Hey, Thor!
Company?
Just what I came here to get away from.
Sis?
Janet?
- Is it you?
- Yeah, Ted.
What the hell's going on?
Playing Nancy Drew, are we, sis?
You caught me at a rather awkward moment.
I was just about to...
restrain myself.
But now that you're already here,
that might be somewhat pointless.
You're going to come clean
with me right now!
Family love, Janet.
I thought it could save me,
but I was wrong.
But, hey, we all make mistakes!
You sent the dog to the pound, Janet.
I warned you.
I told you I shouldn't be here,
but you wouldn't let me go.
You wanted to play big sister.
You had to be right.
You always have to be right, Janet,
but this time you're wrong!
You should have listened
to the dog, Janet.
He was trying to protect you.
-
-
Ted?
Handcuffs. I was going to
use these on myself.
- Can you believe that?
- What's happening?
They, they were supposed to keep
people from finding out about my...
private affair.
My mistress.
Oh, my God.
But, you...
You already know, don't you, sis?
Yes, you know...
the handcuffs won't keep my little
secret a secret any longer.
Come back!
You stupid bitch!
Thor! I'm gonna get you out!
Here, come on!
Come here, Thor!
All right, Thor, come on! Quick!
You're free! Let's go!
Thor, we've gotta get outta here!
Oh, yes!
-
-
-
-
Brett! Brett! Brett!
-
-
Mom!
Mom!
Get the fuck off my son!
Do it.
Finish it.
-
-
Hey, there, big guy.
You saved us.
You're our hero, Thor.
Yeah.
Oh, Thor.
- You're a good dog.
-
Mom, is everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's okay.
Everything's okay.
Gee, Thor, hello.
Come here.
