Hi, I'm Emma and I'm 23 years old
and, er, I want to come live in your house.
Hi, I'm Matt.
Uh, hi, my name is Danny.
Charlie. Just Charlie. Like Madonna.
Rex.
Um, I'd like to be on the show because...
I wanna get famous.
- The prize is still a million dollars?
- The challenge.
For the experience, to learn about myself.
Grow as a person and all that bullshit.
- Why should you pick me?
- You should pick me cos...
Um...
I'm a fucking people-person.
Um...
Why should you choose me?
- I'm a team player.
- What do I think about the rules?
Nightly curfew?
If it's a house in the middle of nowhere,
why the need to break the curfew?
Stay indoors when we're sleeping
and go out during the day. It's not hard.
Well, er, usually I don't like rules but,
you know, these ones don't bother me.
I think I could stick to the rules
for a million dollars, yeah.
Hey, check it out.
I think we're being watched.
Fantastic.
Get up!
Good morning.
This'll be of interest to some of you.
Morning, Matt.
You guys definitely waste food.
I miss fresh fruit.
Are you gonna eat those?
Go nuts.
You know what I miss?
The ocean.
I'm missing June - my social worker.
June, if you're watching this, I miss you.
I miss shops.
When we get out, we'll look so yesterday.
Next week,
we'll have plenty of money for new stuff.
Hear, hear.
What do you miss, Emma?
Intelligent conversation.
Amen, sister.
I miss my grandpa.
Oh, grandpa!
What? I'm gonna take him
on vacation when we get back.
And I've missed my friends.
Although I'd like to think
I've made some new ones.
Ayy!
Probably just a coyote.
Yeah, it's always a damn coyote.
I hate this house.
Fucking creepy-ass house.
What is it? You see anything?
No. Nothing, as usual.
You do think he's cute, right?
He's cute.
So?
So?
So I'd prefer my intimate moments
to be intimate moments.
It's not a porn site.
You could always do it
under the covers or in the den.
- The freezer!
-
I don't know, there's just...
There's something.
He's just so intense all the time.
Oh, yeah.
He's a guy, and it's been six months
that he's been here,
he's really fucking horny,
he'd fuck a hole in the wall!
Shh!
OK. Let's take a look.
It's definitely cold in the house.
Nobody brought the flashlight, huh?
- What do I do with the clicker thingy?
- I'm fine.
-
-  You motherfuckers.
This is deliberate, they're putting
the squeeze on us. Look at this.
Everything has to have an angle with you.
Maybe it just broke down.
- So what do we do?
-  I don't know.
- Start a fire.
- Yeah, there's no dried firewood outside.
No, but there's plenty of dry shit in the attic.
We can chop some of that up.
Go to work, boys.
Oh, God! Smells like piss in here.
Looks like mommy and daddy
liked to keep the kiddies in the cupboard.
What parent would do that?
They must have been
talking to my stepfather.
-  Take cover!
- I always wanted a talking one.
Oh, Emma. Yes, Matt?
Oh, Emma. Matt?
Emma. Matt. Emma. Emma! Emma!
Oh, Emma! Oh, Matt! Oh, Emma! Oh, Matt!
Matt, wait! Wait! What? What? Matt! What?
That's my ass.
- I know, Emma. I know.
- Grow up, Rex.
Don't give me that nice-guy bullshit.
You don't wanna fuck?
Oh, Matt... Matt...
you don't have a dick!
Why don't you... You don't have a dick?
- You wanna talk small dicks?
- Yeah.
Charlie talked to Emma.
Take cover!
- Yeah.
-
What the fuck are you laughing at?
Today's the first day of
the rest of your life as a nonsmoker.
Jesus, I have never heard
so many fucking owls.
You think they have a tape out there?
So, I'm thinking,
when we get back,
are we gonna get mobbed or what?
- Have to go into hiding?
-  Have a stalker?
- Hmm?
- Ooh, yeah.
You knowthe number one cause
of most stalkings?
- Forgetfulness.
- Forgetfulness?
People forgetting to close their curtains.
Their curtains?
I read about this one lady who used to walk around
inside her house at night,
buck naked, lights on, curtains wide open.
She was always forgetting to close them
because her property overlooked woods.
No one out there, right?
Only there was.
This stalker guy.
Just watching those bright,
welcoming windows every night.
He started to think she didn't shut them
because she wanted him to see in,
that she was inviting him into her life.
So he started
this fantasy relationship with her,
all built out of little things like,
when she'd hang her laundry out -
that was like a love token,
an offering.
So he'd steal her panties.
And getting more and more intimate,
this love affair in his head.
Finally, one night he breaks in.
Only when he meets her, he meets a stranger.
An upset stranger freaking out,
wanting him to get out.
He thinks she's just playing hard to get
so he asserts himself.
Rapes her.
Strangles her to keep her from screaming.
Thanks, Matt.
Yeah, thanks.
Now I suddenly feel all on display.
How can you suddenly feel all on display?
It's like hello? Hello? Hello?
On the web is one thing,
outside my window is another.
Don't worry. Statistically,
strangers rarely kill strangers.
You're much more likely to be killed
by somebody you know.
A kid I was at school with killed his parents.
No shit!
What happened there?
He used a hammer.
He beat them to death.
Jesus. That's a little harsh.
Who was he? Did you know him?
Give it up, Emma.
I can't really remember,
I moved away before it happened.
What was his name?
-
- Fuck.
Probably just the wind.
-
- What is that?
Matt. Matt.
-
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm sorry.
Danny, there's someone upstairs. In the attic.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
All right.
Let's go.
- It's coming from up there.
-
-
-
Jesus!
It's OK.
It's just scared.
Crows can scent death, it's kind of a bad omen
to have them flying around your house.
Whoa.
-
-  Oh.
I think it's hurt. Hold that.
There we go, I got him.
I got him.
It's got a broken wing.
-
-  Oh!
It was the kindest thing to do.
I'll take it out at daybreak.
Aaah!
Oh, God, Rex.
What the fuck are you guys doing up here?
I'm going to bed.
We had a visitor.
- What?
- Yeah.
It must have thought it was trapped.
Oh.
Yeah, I can relate.
This fucking house.
'What would I do for a million bucks?
'I guess I'd do as little as I had to.'
Would you drive to school naked?
-
- 'Do I have to get out of the car?'
Hey, guys - package.
-  A package!
-  Nice find, Danny.
I found it by the pool.
Come on, food, food, food, food!
Cigarettes, cigarettes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Bricks?
Bricks?
And a letter.
This isn't funny. We need supplies.
They're tightening the screws.
It's addressed to you.
I want a letter.
What is it, man?
Danny? Hey.
So, the letter said that
the funeral takes place in two days
in Florida.
Florida?
Yeah.
So obviously he wouldn't
make it back for the curfew.
-  We can't stop him if he wants to go.
- No.
We just have to persuade him that
it's in his best interests to stay here.
-  His best interests?
- We don't even know if this letter's real.
Only a twisted mind would think of that.
Yes, and they are twisted.
What, bricks instead of food?
You don't think
this could be part of their game?
Could you build a creepier house?
What if they're fucking with us?
Think about it - no heat, no food, nowthis.
Danny's the weakest link,
they wanna break us.
- Come on.
- No, think about it. Really think about it.
We are this close to a million dollars, guys,
we are this close.
They don't want to pay us,
they don't want us to make it.
Or maybe they're spicing it up for the viewers.
Or maybe his grandfather is dead!
If his grandfather's dead, he's dead. I'm sorry.
His grandfather practically raised him.
Do you have no feelings at all?
Cut the crap, I'm here for the money, OK?
So are you.
Dress it up however you want - exposure,
slumming it, finding yourself - I don't know.
The only person not here for the money
is the one who needs it the most
but, no, Danny's here to make friends.
Fine, let's be friends to the guy,
let's give him some long-term, practical help.
Well, we can't hold a gun to his head.
No.
OK. We'll tell him we'll have
an alternative memorial service in the yard.
Emma, tell him.
You tell him.
We all know he likes you best,
just ask him nicely.
You would do it best.
Maybe we should just let him go.
Some things are more important than money.
- Yeah, what, like pussy?
- Hey, man, fuck you.
Doesn't family mean anything to you?
You don't miss what you've never had, man.
Take cover!
- 'Let's go.'
-
Look!
What?
What the hell...?
Jesus. It must have been
one of the guys fucking around.
No. Charlie, I think it's someone else.
Who?
I think we're out of shot. Shoot.
You know I told you all about that kid
at my school who killed his parents?
His name was John Riley.
Well, he wasn't just a kid at my school,
he was a kid on my street.
We used to play together after school.
We had this one favourite game, Scaredy-cat,
where we'd see
who could spook each other the most.
And it started out, you know,
like jumping out from behind trees shouting, ''Boo!''
That kind of thing.
But then it got more serious.
John had a kitten, which he adored.
He'd sneak it into school in his knapsack.
One time...
I swapped the kitten for a brick
and I tossed the knapsack into the school pool.
He was so scared, he peed his pants.
Right in front of everyone.
When I showed him the kitten was fine,
he just gave me this look,
this black look.
Like, ''Never turn your back
''because one day
I'm going to get you back for this.''
But he wouldn't surrender the game.
He just kept screaming,
''You sick bitch.''
First the bricks in the package,
now someone writes this.
It feels so personal.
I mean, why am I being singled out?
Charlie...
- You don't think that...
- Emma, I...
I just think that we've been in this house
way too fucking long.
Like Rex says, it's all a game.
I bet it's the company...
But how would they know all that?
I don't know.
Research, I guess.
Let's just go back to bed, OK?
Come on, it'll be OK.
Come and keep me warm.
Guys, a package.
Better be food this time.
Oh.
Sweet. Champagne.
They do still love us.
Five.
-  You motherfuckers.
- One for each, I guess.
I know what this...
You cocksuckers, I know what this means.
Fuck you.
Do your fucking research,
cos him doing that to himself
was the best thing
that ever fucking happened to me.
What?
I say we put this out of harm's way.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
- They think they can fuck with me now?
- His dad, right?
You're here to check up on me.
It's not a front, Matt, I just don't care.
I wish I did but I don't.
Anyways, I brought my own coping mechanism.
Sit down.
Hand me that book.
You want to worry about somebody,
worry about Bundy.
I don't know whether to feel sorry for him
or be afraid of him.
Why did they pick you, Matt?
What are the skeletons in your closet?
Like I'm gonna spill it now?
Give them some ammo to shoot me with?
That's good. Yeah, that's good.
But if there are any, they got 'em already.
Question is, do you have any?
Or are you just sliced white bread?
Is someone out there?
Emma?
- You OK?
- The security lights just popped
and I would swear there's someone
on the edge of the forest.
Look, you're just freaked out.
Charlie told us what happened last night.
Emma, you can't think
this has anything to do with...
To do with what?
When you were a kid, you know?
Yeah.
I guess that would be ridiculous.
- I know.
- Yeah.
Aaah!
- Emma! What...?
- What's wrong?
What is that?
Oh, my God.
-  Oh, shit.
-  Is that some kind of joke?
- Rex, did you put that in there?
- Fuck off, Charlie.
Just don't touch it! Put it down!
What the fuck?
I didn't put it there!
Did you hear anybody?
There's people, like, walking round the house?
Calm the fuck down, please. For two seconds.
Emma, there's nobody here.
Guys, this is the company all over again.
They've raised the stakes but they're playing
the same fucked-up game, so calm down.
They're coming inside now?
Game over.
- I can't take this.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna radio them. They can pick me up.
No, no, no, no. I mean, no.
Listen. Wait, stay. Emma? Emma, Emma.
Look, it was me. OK?
It was me. I'm sorry.
It was a stupid joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Wait.
- What's your problem?
What's your problem?
You're always picking on people.
Stop it! Stop it!
Come on. Danny! It's not worth it.
You OK?
I'm here for the money.
What's your excuse?
What, you've got no life of your own?
It's not real enough for you?
No family? What is it?
I pity you.
You sad fuck.
Rex.
I just wanted to say that, even for you,
that was really fucked up.
Why would you do that?
I didn't put it there, OK?
I didn't put it there,
I just said I did so Emma wouldn't leave.
I need that fucking prize money
and I wasn't gonna let her leave.
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God, don't do that.
I still think it's the company, all right?
It's the company.
But how would they get it in there?
They control all this shit, right?
It's part of their game.
They wanted to spice things up
so this is what they do.
Plus, I think...
You know, maybe they're...
pissed off there hasn't been
any action or whatever.
Well, not recently.
Anyways...
You think they're punishing us?
Yeah. I don't know, maybe.
Maybe we've been...
punishing ourselves, you know?
God, I wish I had a smoke.
Charlie, wait.
Charlie, Charlie, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
OK.
You want a cigarette?
Don't say I never did nothing for you.
One pack of cigarettes. For you.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is this?
- It's just some...
- You hoarding little bastard!
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, my God. Guys!
- Guys!
- Charlie, shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, you little prick.
I'll spli...
Great.
Why'd he take cigarettes?
He doesn't even smoke.
To fuck with me.
He's a snake.
He'd sell his own grandmother.
He says my grandpa's not dead.
That the letter's fake
and it's all part of the game.
Do you think it's true?
You got to give me some of that.
You are such a selfish bastard.
Oh, fuck you.
Fuck you, you are so fucking self-righteous.
You're so fucking self-important.
All this John Riley bullshit, do you really think
he gives a fuck about you now?
Jesus, Emma, you must
really fucking rate yourself.
- Knock it off, Rex.
- Go fuck yourself, Matt,
cos she's not going to.
You know, if I was a psycho killer,
I wouldn't be hanging out there.
I'd have my sights set right on this house.
That's enough, Rex.
Don't kid yourself, she's not into you either.
Asshole.
Ahem!
Hey, psycho!
Oh, my God. Don't be a fucking prick, Rex!
- Psycho killer, come on in!
-  Rex.
It's nice in here!
We got food, we got liquor,
- we got women!
- Just stop.
One in particular you might be interested in.
Come on in.
-
- Fuck, there is somebody out there.
Shit. The lights.
- There is someone there.
-  Aah!
Shit. He's heading this way.
- It's cold out there, maybe he needs help.
- Would you recognise him?
We'll only open the door
if you're 100%%% certain it's not him.
- Is it John?
-  I don't know!
Please open up the door.
-  No! Danny, no!
- It's all right.
-  What's wrong with you?
- Hey!
Get his ID.
Wait.
Come on, some ID.
What?
Some ID. Some identification of who you are.
All right. Travis Patterson.
It's nice to meet you.
Come on, come on.
Gimme the light. Yeah, you could fake this.
Oh, come on.
- Do I look like I'm under 21?
-  What's your star sign?
Cancer. What's yours?
- I'm a Gemini.
- You see anyone else out there?
Just the Reaper.
I swear, a few more hours out there
and I'd be as dead as...
- I'd be as dead as the battery on this GPS.
-  Let me see that.
- It's a locator?
- Yeah.
- So you know where we are?
- Yeah. You guys don't?
No, we don't.
Uh, I don't mean to be rude,
obviously you're very
concerned about security,
but who the fuck are you guys?
You don't recognise us?
Should I?
- Are you on the internet?
- All the time, I'm a programmer.
- And you don't know who we are?
- I'm sorry.
I'm tired, am I missing a joke here?
We're part of an internet webcast.
Like a human aquarium.
See, there's webcams all over the place,
even in the bathroom.
- They run 24/7. People subscribe to us.
- What's the site?
- We weren't told.
- You weren't... You weren't told?
The company that set this up
didn't start advertising till we got here.
Well, they didn't do such a hot job
because I never heard of you.
And I live online.
- Maybe you live in the wrong area.
- Well, it's the internet.
- It's the worldwide web.
- There's a lot of sites.
Yeah. So why would I watch you guys?
What's your hook?
She takes her clothes off.
Shut up. Jerk.
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Travis. Sorry my hands are cold.
- You're sure you've never seen me before?
- No. I'd definitely remember.
Uh, we're here.
-  Thanks.
-
What's the scale of this map?
On this map, what's the scale?
- 1:50,000.
-  Oh, fuck! We're in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah, pretty much.
What's the nearest town?
Uh, Wilmington is.
-  Where's that?
- That's...
That's right over there.
So where'd you ski from?
- From my truck.
-  So where's your truck?
Where I left it, I guess.
-  Does anybody wanna dance?
- Yeah.
-
- Yeah.
Do you believe his story
about skiing out here?
I don't know. Maybe I'm being paranoid
but it seems too convenient.
You know, he didn't seem
fazed at all by the cameras.
Remember howfreaked out
we were when we moved in?
Were?
Are you gonna pass that?
I only hope Charlie knows
what she's getting herself into.
Emma, um, do you want...do you want to dance?
No, Danny. Thank you.
I'm gonna go to bed.
-
-  Emma.
Rex, do you want to dance?
Asshole.
Ooh. OK!
-
-
Mmm.
Mmm.
You wanna go upstairs?
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm?
I hate that guy.
He's a freak.
Mr Skier!
Go get into bed.
Oh, God.
* Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me
* Callin' me all the time like Blondie
* Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde,
it's fine all of the time
* Like sex on the beaches
* What else is in the teaches of Peaches?
* Huh, what?
Oh!
* Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me
* Callin' me all the time like Blondie
* Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde,
it's fine all of the time
* What else is in the teaches of Peaches?
* Like sex on the beaches...
-
-  Emma.
* Fuck the pain away, fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away, fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away, fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away, fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away
* Fuck the pain away *
I told you I could fuck her.
Say hi to the wife for me.
God, isn't Charlie great?
He thinks we're morons.
We know who you're working for,
and I want you to tell the company
that we're gonna get that million dollars.
You so need to get laid.
Come in, big boy.
''Big Boy'' has left the building.
Sugar?
Take cover!
Danny.
I'm gonna say something to you,
and I want you to listen very carefully.
I am sorry about all that's happened to you,
but it's no excuse.
There's no excuse for you taking my things.
I can't be friends with someone who does that.
I didn't take anything.
Danny,
I found these in your room, OK?
- I didn't take them.
- Danny!
Look, we're not here much longer, OK?
So why don't we just try to be civil, polite
and honest with each other, OK?
Matt! Guys, get in here!
Delivery?
'Time out.'
I found it by the snare. It's Travis's backpack.
-  Was it a grizzly?
- Oh, my God!
No, there are no animal tracks, no footprints either.
- We have to radio for help.
- For who?
- For Travis?
- It's not real, it's part of the game. Relax.
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?
- There's blood, he could be hurt.
- He's not.
-  Looks real to me.
-  He's not. If he was, where's the body?
They want us to call for help, guys.
That's what they want.
If we do, you think some cop is gonna care
about our curfew when he sees my rap sheet?
- All you can think about is the curfew.
- If we call the cops, we lose.
That's what they want.
That's what they want!
Oh, Christ! Fine. Fine, you know what?
If you're that worried, talk to them.
They can get help, right?
- Yeah, somebody...
- Guys! You've seen what's happened here.
- You know where we are. Send help.
- Oh, yeah.
And Travis, if that is your real name,
go fuck yourself.
You're not gonna scare me
out of my money. OK, buddy?
Don't give them the pleasure, guys.
They've laughed enough at our expense
as it is, especially at you, Charlie.
- What?
- Especially at you.
- Fuck you!
- You knowthat whole thing was a setup, right?
That's why he picked the easy target.
You noticed he wasn't
too afraid of the cameras, right?
Travis, Travis, Travis. Where are you now,
you son of a bitch?
- Emma.
- Danny.
I didn't take your clothes.
It was them. They're messing with us.
It's just part of a game.
- Danny, please, don't...
- Look, I made this for you.
- Take it.
- Danny, I can't take that.
I made it for you.
OK.
Charlie.
From Danny.
Oh, I get it. It's your pussy.
- Hi, Emma's pussy. Scratch and sniff.
- Don't.
Give him a break. He spent hours down there,
bashing away with his little thingy.
Em-ma! Em...
- Emma's creepy pussy.
- It's horrible.
Guys!
- Danny.
- Matt.
Matt, don't. Don't. Don't! He's dead. He's dead.
-  Emma. Oh, my God.
- I can't look.
- I'm fine.
- It's OK.
- I'll get it.
- It's OK.
It's not OK. It's not OK!
It's so not OK.
What are we gonna do?
We wait for the helicopter.
Game's over, right? Can't go on now.
- What about...?
- It's not our responsibility. It's their fucking game.
We've played everything fair up till here, guys.
This is not our fault.
We've done nothing wrong here.
We can't. We can't leave him there.
You're not supposed to move him.
I saw it on TV. We can't move him.
We should cover him. We should cover him.
Or we could take him outside.
Outside?
Yeah, well, you want... Where else?
OK.
You guys take him outside,
and we're gonna try the radio.
Please.
- That's good.
-
Hello, can anybody hear me?
Please, somebody's dead. Please help.
- Please, we need help.
- Nobody's there.
I just fucking can't believe that he...
-  This isn't what we signed up for.
- No, it's not.
What kind of a sick fuck would subscribe to this?
Hold on a minute. Hold on a fucking minute.
OK.
- Sorry the way things have turned out for us.
- It's OK.
Come here.
- Emma, I...
-  Guys! Guys!
You've got to fucking see this.
Where's Charlie? Charlie!
Ever wonder
howthe company plans on paying us?
Or howthey pay for the house,
the food and the helicopter?
Advertising.
Subscriptions.
You don't get one without the other.
If nobody subscribes, the revenues dry up.
And I've been thinking, this guy Travis,
he was a fucking programmer, a web-head.
He should spend his entire life on the internet,
so how had he never seen a single ad?
- There's tons of shit on the internet.
- Right.
- That's why I went on the internet.
-  How?
- The satellite uplink still works.
- Where did you learn that?
Computer club. I've been looking for our site.
I have put our names through
every single fucking search engine I can think of
and I have got nothing, guys.
And I mean nothing at all.
Not even an advertisement.
Nothing, not a single fucking ad.
- It's a big place.
- Yeah.
But why are they making it
so difficult to find the site?
If they want people to go to it,
why are they making it so tough?
Well, I did find it. It was hard as hell, but I found it.
But it's fucked.
It doesn't have a name, it's a beta site.
I tripped over it,
I was tipped off on a hacker newsgroup.
- What's a beta site?
- A beta site is a...
like a password name, like a mess of letters
and numbers instead of a real name.
It's fucked. Take a look.
- This is our site?
- I don't know.
I'm trying to subscribe, I've been using
Travis's credit card. This has a limit of $50,000.
- How do you know?
- You learn a lot at computer club.
- You can buy a house with that.
- But it doesn't get you to the keyhole on this.
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it either. I don't get it either!
This place doesn't fucking advertise.
It doesn't even have a real address,
so all I can come up with
is that it doesn't want to attract attention.
But why? And the security...
the security is fucking insane.
I threw every hacker file I have at this,
we're talking serious back door fuckers,
and I still can't bypass the encryption.
- So what's your point?
- My point, guys...
simply put, is why the fuck
would people pay so much money to watch us?
I wanna know, is this thing legit?
-  Is it fucking legit? Is it legal?
- Like a porn site?
Yeah, but except for her escapades
it's hardly porn.
So, what is it then? What?
Am I the only person thinking this here?
Is it only clear to me?
Nobody's ever heard of a snuff movie before?
A snuff site? Danny's dead already!
- No, Danny killed himself.
- How do we knowthat?
- Jesus!
- You explain this, it seems fucked up right now.
Am I wrong? This is seeming kinda fucked up!
What the fuck...?
Oh, shit.
Why are there numbers
against our names?
They're betting odds.
Oh, my God!
They're fucking betting odds!
'Oh, my God!'
'They're fucking betting odds!'
You sons of bitches!
You sons of bitches!
- I can email for help.
- Relax.
I'm gonna email somebody...
Come on, you son of a bitch.
- They've cut me off! These fuckers...
-  No, the signal just died.
- Wait, Rex. Calm down!
-
There's no prize money,
and they're gonna fucking kill us!
Rex, this is not a snuff website.
Think about it.
Who are they gonna kill, the four of us?
You're the one who keeps saying
this is just one of their games.
That's all this is, another game.
They're just fucking with us.
Come on. We're almost out of here.
Tomorrow we leave.
- Tomorrow we get our money...
- What do we do tonight?
If you're that worried,
I'll get the gun and stand guard till morning.
They're still playing.
It's dark out there, I can't see anything.
Security lights would trigger
if anyone was out there.
-  What are you looking for, Rex?
- I saw it in here somewhere.
- What?
- Come on, you son of a bitch. Bingo!
I knew Travis kept an emergency flare.
We can set this off.
-  But you'd have to go outside to shoot it.
- I know.
- You could shoot it from the roof.
- Yeah, OK.
I just don't want to go out there by myself. So...
I'll go with you.
OK.
OK, good, good.
Don't worry, OK?
Don't worry, this is gonna work.
This is gonna work, somebody's gonna see it
and somebody's gonna call the cops.
What, some good citizen?
They do exist, Emma. We knew one.
You should have this. It's Danny's penknife.
OK.
Rex.
- I never even gave him a chance.
- He didn't have a chance, Emma.
- They didn't want him to have a chance.
- They?
Emma, this isn't about your past.
They just want you to think that.
- They just want you to think that.
- That's why they picked me?
At first light, we head out. Together, OK?
OK? And they can fuck their money.
When I get out of here,
maybe I'll give LA another try. You know?
I was really hoping this would be successful.
You're on prime time now.
- You think?
- The internet's global.
You're always prime time somewhere.
Huge in Japan.
And you know howto be yourself
in front of the camera, howto relax.
- That's half the battle, right?
- I guess.
I don't feel very relaxed right now.
Come over here.
I'll help you relax.
- Mmm...
- Oh, yeah. I can feel it.
It's like a big knot.
Mmm, yeah.
Mmm.
Mm-hm.
Lean forward.
Matt...
You've got everything.
Why did you sign up for this?
Curiosity.
- See how it'd feel.
- Mmm.
- What, the isolation?
- The fear.
- The fear?
- Yeah.
It feels good.
- Should I kill her now?
-
-
- It's why you're watching, isn't it?
Was that OK?
Shit.
'Press the frigging start button, would you?'
Matt?
Guys?
'Hello? Press the button.'
'Come on. Today. Let's go.'
'At first, everything looked the same,
like nothing ever happened.
'I wondered if all of it had just been a bad dream.
Boy, was I wrong.'
'Oh, no. Not again. Damn it, it won't shut off.'
He's fucking here. He's just come for us.
We gotta go upstairs. Let's go.
Go. Go.
Do you hear anything? Can you hear him?
- Did you see him?
- I saw him get Charlie.
Charlie...
What about Rex?
- Not yet.
- Matt?
- Emma, I'm most worried about you now.
- What are you doing?
- It's just us now. We've got to stick together.
- The door!
- We belong together. We do.
- No!
- Do you hear? He's out there. John!
- No!
- John, are you out there?
- No!
Why are you turning the light on?
Because I want them to see
what I'm going to do to you.
All that John Riley shit in your journal.
You actually believe you triggered his psychosis.
After all this time,
he'd battle through a frozen wasteland
just to win a childhood bet?
Rex was right.
That's some fucking ego, Emma.
Get on the bed.
Get on the bed, Emma.
Fucking bitch!
-
- Aghh!
You fucking bitch!
- Help me!
- Calm down. What's going on here?
- In there!
- If you want me to help, you'll have to calm down.
He killed everyone. He's after me!
-  Calm down. I have to follow procedure.
- Help me!
Deep breaths. There you go. Inside the car.
- I'll take care of it. Don't worry.
- He killed everyone!
Are you the one that set off the flare? Huh?
Yes? And there's somebody in there?
- Yes.
- Is he armed?
- He has an axe.
- An axe. OK.
- Don't leave me!
- Stay calm, miss. I'll be right back, OK?
Car 10-57 requesting backup.
You've gotta let me do it.
I was in this house six fucking months.
What do you think I've been doing
for the past six months?
No!
Just give me the fucking keys, man.
No!
- What are you gonna do, bleed on her?
-
I can do it!
Give me the fucking keys. I can do it!
No! No!
No!
-
- No!
No.
No!
-
- Whoo.
Time to celebrate.
- To the company.
- The company.
Think they'll be pleased?
- You'll probably get a promotion.
- You think so?
- Yeah. Your own parking space.
- Parking space?
Who do you think we are?
You think we have an office?
Business cards, a brochure?
Huh?
There is no ''they'', Matt. ''They'' is us.
Just me, Travis and some very rich clients.
Low overhead, maximum profit.
As for product, well...
There's always plenty of low-hanging fruit,
ripe to be picked.
- Always five suckers.
- You mean four.
She's a little wriggler.
- You getting this, Travis?
-  'Yeah, looking good from here.'
Let me see.
Help me!
'Uh, hi, my name is Danny.'
- 'Charlie, just Charlie. Like Madonna.'
