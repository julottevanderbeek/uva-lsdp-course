# I'm sittin' on top
of the world #
# And I'm quittin'
the blues of the world #
# Glory hallelujah!
I just told the parson #
# "Hey, Par,
get ready to call" #
# And I'm sittin'
on top of the world #
# I've only got one suit
just one #
Move along.
# And I'm sittin', sittin'
on top, top of the world #
# And I'm quittin' quittin'
the blues blues of the world #
# Glory hallelujah!
I just told the parson #
# "Hey, Par,
get ready to call" #
# Yeah! I'm sittin'
on top, top of the world #
Oh!
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?
It's hysterical, Manny.
As long as we're laughing...
we won't cry
over the box office.
Talk about depressing.
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.
That's depressing.
I love a good chorus line.
What's this?
It's a play.
Who wrote it, Annie?
Some guy. Driscoll.
Driscoll.
From the Federal Theatre.
Don't knock it, honey. At
least they got an audience.
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?
It always does.
See you tomorrow.
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.
Works well
out through the nose, too.
Have you eaten today?
Oh...
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.
Hey.
You're all I've got.
Come on, take me to dinner.
Okay.
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.
Harry, what's going on?
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.
It's all right for you. We haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.
How we gonna eat?
They're not getting away
with this! They just did.
Ann, it's no use.
The show, it's over.
It's done.
I'm done.
I'm leaving, Annie.
I'm going back to Chicago.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Annie.
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.
You gotta
think of yourself now.
You should try out
for that part.
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.
Every time you reach out for
something you care about...
fate comes along
and snatches it away.
But not this time, Annie.
Not this time.
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.
Look, miss, I told you
already, call my office.
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.
But I already sent you my
résumé. You returned it unopened.
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we
just gave the part to someone else.
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.
I know times are tough.
You want my advice?
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.
There's a new place.
It just opened.
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.
Just play the date,
take the money...
forget you was ever there.
How much more is there?
Another five reels.
Lights up.
This is it?
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?
Another one of your
safari pictures?
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...
so she could
get her teeth fixed.
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.
Carl, you've been in
production for over two months.
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...
once we get them on the ship.
What ship?
The one that we hired
to get to the location.
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.
Yes, I understand that.
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...
and I'll tell you why.
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.
Life intervened.
I've come into possession
of a map.
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.
A place that was thought
to exist only in myth.
Until now.
Whoa, Carl, slow down.
Is he asking for more money?
He's asking us
to fund a wild goose chase.
I'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.
The ruins
of an entire civilization.
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.
Will there be boobies?
Boobies?
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.
In my experience, people
only go to these films...
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.
What are you, an idiot?
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?
No! They respected the
filmmaker. They showed some class.
Not that you'd know what
that means, you cheap lowlife!
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?
Zelman and Associates.
Give me that, quick.
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.
He's had a lot of
near-success.
He's a preening self-promoter.
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's
got "loser" written all over him.
I understand
your disappointment...
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.
He's washed up.
It's all over town.
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.
The animal footage has value.
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.
Get him back in.
Mr. Denham.
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.
No, Carl,
you can't do this.
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.
It's not ethical! What
are they gonna do, sue me?
They can get in line.
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.
You realize that none of the
camera equipment is on board?
We have no permits,
no visas.
That's why I have you,
Preston.
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.
He's there.
Get in there. Who's
gonna pay for the ship?
Get in.
You get out of there! Come
here! Step on it! Step on it!
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!
Don't worry, Preston. I've
had a lot of practice at this.
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.
Red Label, 80% proof...
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade. "
You got it.
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?
Yesterday. I told you.
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?
That's what you told her.
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.
She's unavailable.
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?
You'll never get her
into a size four.
You gotta get a girl that'll
fit into Maureen's costumes.
Fay's a size four.
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.
Cooper, huh?
I might have known.
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.
Not an option.
Carl.
I said I'd find a girl.
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!
Defeat is always momentary.
What?
Hey! You gonna pay for this?
Excuse me.
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.
Vaudeville, huh?
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.
Mr. Denham...
I want you to know...
that I'm not in the habit of
accepting charity from strangers.
Or, for that matter...
taking things
that don't belong to me.
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.
It's just that I haven't
been paid in a while.
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?
No, no. Oh, God, no.
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.
I'm not that type
of person at all.
What type of person are you?
I'm someone you can trust,
Ann. I'm a movie producer.
Believe me, I am on the level. No
funny business. Please sit down.
Please. Please.
Okay.
Ann, I want you to imagine...
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.
You're filming
in the Far East?
Singapore.
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...
She falls in love.
Yes.
But she doesn't trust it.
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.
Uh...
really?
Lf she loves someone,
it's doomed.
Why is that?
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.
Now, I don't wanna rush you, but
we are under some time pressure.
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...
you're perfect. Look at you.
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.
Good luck with your picture.
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!
I'm offering you money.
Adventure, fame, the thrill of a
lifetime, and a long sea voyage.
You want to read a script?
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.
Jack Driscoll?
Sure. Why?
Wait. You know him?
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.
He said to me, "Carl...
"somewhere out there is a
woman born to play this role. "
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.
Knew what?
It was always
going to be you.
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.
Keep the change.
Is this
the moving picture ship?
Not exactly.
It's actually
this one over here.
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.
This is all of it?
Yeah.
We're taking the Bell & Howell? Yeah.
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.
Carl!
Yes!
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.
It's bad, it's bad.
They're on their way.
I've just had word.
Who?
Men in uniform.
The studio called the cops.
Englehorn! Cast off!
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!
I cannot do that.
We are waiting
on the manifest.
What? Who? English, please.
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.
Can we talk about this later?
Can't you see we're in
the company of a VIP guest?
Ma'am.
Ann Darrow.
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?
Sure.
Nervous?
Nervous? No.
Why? Should I be?
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?
Do I have a choice?
Please follow me.
If there's anything that
you... Excuse me, fellows.
If there's anything that you
need, please don't hesitate to ask.
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.
What's this?
It's the script.
This is a script?
Jack, this is 15 pages.
I know, but they're good. You've
got 15 good pages there, Carl.
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.
No, Jack, you can't do this
to me. I have a beginning...
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.
You're gonna pay me?
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.
How's $2,000 sound?
Sounds great.
I thought it might.
Sounds great.
Okay.
Raise the spring line!
Watch the aft!
And voilà.
Thanks.
You've written "two grand. "
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Two thousand dollars. "
It is the 29th, isn't it?
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.
Never mind, Carl. Just
pay me when you get back.
All right.
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?
Be a sport and lend a
hand here, would you?
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...
Christ!
Appreciate the help, fellow.
Let me get the door for you.
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.
Oh, Christ!
God damn it!
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.
Oh, no! No!
You're much better off
sticking with film.
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.
I happen to love the theater.
No, you don't.
If you really loved it...
you would have jumped.
You! This is your fault!
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.
You sell them to zoos?
Zoo, circus.
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.
Stain unremovable.
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.
Choy.
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?
Spoiled for choice.
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?
Or a chimpanzee?
I'll take this one.
I told you to lock it up.
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't give the orders!
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?
Get them out of here.
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.
Lamb's brains
in walnut sauce.
Jimmy.
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?
He don't mean no harm.
Thanks.
I'll keep him out of
your way. It's okay.
It's just that
he likes it down here.
It's where I found him
four years ago.
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.
His arm was broken
in two places.
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.
Still won't tell me
where he came from.
But it wasn't anyplace good.
You got to straighten up.
Jimmy.
You don't want to be on this
ship the rest of your life.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.
I've been reading.
Where'd you get this?
I borrowed it.
On long-term loan.
Look at this. Look, look.
"Adventures on a tramp
steamer. " See? Just like us.
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.
I'm a huge fan.
I've read everything
you've ever written.
No, too much.
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.
Seagulls.
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.
I don't care, Mike.
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.
Ann! Come on in. Let me
introduce you to the crew.
This is Herb, the cameraman.
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.
May I say
what a lovely dress?
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?
Lumpy, you heard the lady.
Fancy my porridge
à la walnuts?
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...
Ann?
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.
Thrilled to meet you. It's
an honor to be a part of this.
Gee, thanks.
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.
Really?
Yes,
and what I most admire...
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.
Well, that's my job.
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...
if you don't mind me
saying...
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...
He's so much younger in
person. And much better-looking.
Ann, stop. Stop right there.
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...
the tweedy twerp with his nose in
his book and his head up his a...
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.
Good Christ!
She's standing
at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet...
But they are sailing towards
disaster. You got that?
Okay, so she turns...
the first mate
is staggering towards her.
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.
Ann is nearsighted. It could
have happened to anyone.
I was joking, Carl.
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.
And that's when she sees it.
Sees what?
What?
The island.
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?
Jack, keep your voice down.
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?
All right.
It has a local name...
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.
They call it Skull Island.
Did you get that?
What's wrong
with this place?
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.
Because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.
Okay. All right.
So we arrive at this place.
S...
K...
U...
L...
L...
Island.
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?
No, they're a nuisance.
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.
Cut!
It's great.
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.
That was very natural.
I felt moved.
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?
It was pure effluence.
I beefed up the banter.
Try to resist that impulse.
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?
Actors.
Travel the world, but all
they ever see is a mirror.
Good legs.
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.
Yeah.
Not that you don't have good
legs. Just making conversation.
Jesus. Miss Darrow!
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...
he must ignore her.
And if things turn
really hostile, then...
No?
Interesting theory.
I know. I should have...
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...
I'm sorry. I was...
And you made it your own.
I was nervous.
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.
Please don't say
another word. Good night.
Miss Darrow.
You don't have to be nervous.
Thank you.
Let's take it...
Would you please... We're
trying to shoot a scene.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay, again.
We're close. Turn southwest.
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.
I won't sail blind
in these waters.
I'll make it
won'th your while.
There's nothing out there.
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...
what would you say?
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.
Well, we turned southwest
last night.
Gentlemen, please.
We're not looking for trouble. No.
You're looking
for something else.
Yes, we are.
We're going to find
Skull Island.
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.
What do you mean?
Seven years ago, me and Mr.
Hayes were working our passage...
on a Norwegian bark.
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.
He'd been drifting for days.
His ship had run aground on
an island way west of Sumatra.
An island hidden in fog.
He spoke of a huge wall...
built so long ago...
no one knew who'd made it.
A wall 100 foot high...
as strong today
as it was ages ago.
Why'd they build the wall?
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...
neither beast nor man...
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.
A lion or a tiger.
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.
What else did he say?
Nothing.
We found him the next morning. He'd
stuck a knife through his heart.
Mmm-hmm.
Sorry, fellows. You'll
have to do better than that.
Monsters belong in B movies.
If you find this place...
if you go ashore with your
friends and your cameras...
you won't come back.
Just as long as
you understand that.
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?
You're writing a stage comedy?
I'm writing it for you.
Why would you do that?
Why would I write a play for you? Yes.
Isn't it obvious?
Not to me.
Well...
it's in the subtext.
I guess
I must have missed it.
It's not about words.
Message for you, Captain.
What's going on?
Hayes,
why are we changing course?
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.
Did you know that?
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.
I want you off my ship.
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.
I'm finished.
It's over for me, Jack.
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?
Check our position.
Use the stars.
There are no stars, Captain.
What is that?
What?
That.
That right there.
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?
Station the forward lookout and
get me the depth by lead line.
Aye, Captain.
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.
Dead slow ahead, both.
You should stop the ship.
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.
We'll find clear conditions.
We have seabed!
We're shallowing!
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!
Get me another reading!
Another reading!
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.
Wall! There's a wall ahead!
Stop engines!
Give me some power!
Half astern both.
Half astern both, Captain!
Rocks!
Rocks!
Rocks to starboard, Captain!
To port! Rocks everywhere!
Take the wheel, Hayes.
Hang on!
Full ahead!
Rocks to port, Captain!
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!
Ah!
Shore up that breach!
Get me more men down here
now! Come on, move, move!
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!
What about the prop?
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.
But she struck hard
against the rock!
Captain!
Better come up quick!
Right there!
Want me to bring them back?
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!
Come on, move it.
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.
Can you believe this, Jack?
We've got our picture.
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?
Why doesn't he turn back?
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.
But there's another part...
that needs to know.
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.
"We could not understand
because we were too far...
"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...
"of those ages
that are gone...
"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.
"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...
"there you could look at a
thing monstrous and free. "
It's not
an adventure story...
is it, Mr. Hayes?
No, Jimmy.
It's not.
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.
I will handle this.
Look. Chocolate.
You like chocolate?
It's good to eat.
You want?
Take it.
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.
She doesn't want
the chocolate.
Aah!
All right!
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!
They're harmless!
Ann!
Jack.
Seen enough?
Lighten the ship!
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!
Just heave it!
We got away.
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.
What about Mike? He didn't
get away! He's still there!
Mike died doing what he believed
in! He didn't die for nothing.
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!
I'll finish it...
and I'll donate
the proceeds...
to his wife and kids.
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.
Hear, hear!
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!
Drop those spare cables
overboard! Go on, just chuck it!
Where's Ann?
What?
Where's Ann?
Ann!
She's free!
Full ahead, both engines!
Ann!
No! Stop! Turn back!
Stop!
We have to turn back.
They've taken Ann.
Kong! Kong! Kong!
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!
Come on, move it!
Pull harder!
Row! Row!
Come on!
Kong.
Spread out! Find her!
Miss Darrow!
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!
Ann!
She's here somewhere!
What in God's name was that?
Behind the wall!
Behind the wall!
She's gone!
Carl, what is it?
You saw something.
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.
The rest of you
stay with the ship.
Choy!
Not you, Jimmy.
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.
Stay here.
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?
The wide-angle
will do just fine.
