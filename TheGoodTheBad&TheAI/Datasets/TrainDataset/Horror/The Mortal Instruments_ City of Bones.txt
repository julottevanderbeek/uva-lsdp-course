Yeah, no, I know, but when
you tell me to do something,
I'm gonna do it, so I'm
e-mailing him right now.
Well, I don't know how
quick he's gonna get back
'cause you know sometimes
he doesn't check, so...
Yeah, and after the poetry
reading, I'm not going home.
I mean, it's my birthday,
so I want to go to a club.
Mmm-hmm.
No, Simon,
I'm not gonna lie to her.
I'm just not gonna
tell her.
LUKE: Let me go
park the truck.
See you later, all right? Okay.
Hi, Dorothea, how are you?
I'm good, thanks for asking.
CLARY: So I'll just call, I
guess, and get extra tickets.
Yeah, sure.
I'll do it right now. Hey, you.
Simon.
Yeah.
Hi, Simon.
Yeah.
He says, "Call me." Mmm-hmm.
CLARY: Yeah, yeah,
she just got home.
I'm sure she can hear you,
she's standing right here.
Uh, hey, Luke. How's
it going, Clary?
No, I'll get
dressed quick.
Do you want
some coffee?
CLARY: If we keep talking,
I'm gonna be late.
Yeah, I'll meet
you there. Bye.
Did you just use the...
How are you feeling?
Fine, why?
You make sure you come
straight home tonight.
Mom, come on.
Just a poetry reading.
I know.
Bye.
You need to talk
to her, Jocelyn.
She's not ready, not yet.
Yes, she is.
You're not.
SIMON: By the way,
thanks for doing this.
His poetry means
a lot to him.
CLARY: That's what
friends are for.
ERIC: "Come
"My faux juggernaut
"Slather
"Every protuberance
with arid zeal
"Agony
I can't listen to this.
You want another coffee?
Yeah.
"Like tiny crocus
petals whisper death"
Cappuccino
and espresso.
Hi.
Hey.
"Shivering breezes weave
through a morbid tapestry
There you go.
Thank you.
earth..."
That blonde girl over there was
totally flirting with you.
Ask her out.
Nah, it wouldn't be fair.
Why?
Well, becauseâ€œ.
Because I'm saving
myself for someone else.
Who?
Hey.
Thank you,
thank you very much.
CLARY: Think he's
getting worse.
As his friend, you should
probably tell him.
Maybe his poetry is great,
we just don't know it yet.
Hey.
Let's go in here.
I want to ask what
that symbol means.
Clary, we'll
never get in.
Such the eternal optimist.
SIMON: This is so
not like you.
Just go with
it for once.
Um, hi. What does
that symbol mean?
What symbol?
Yeah, what symbol?
It's right there. You don't...
You don't see it?
SIMON: No.
Hey, that was cool.
SIMON: Yeah, we're fitting in.
CLARY: Move it, go with it.
Clary, you want a drink?
Yeah.
Clary, Clary,
what is it?
You didn't see that?
I know what I saw. They killed
the guy that let us in the club.
Did you drink something?
Yeah... No, Simon.
You know, I've heard
sometimes they pump
hallucinogenic stuff
into the air vents
to make sure people
have a good time.
Okay, then how come you're fine?
Did we breathe different air?
I don't know. Let's just go home.
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
You've been
sleeping all day.
And you didn't come home
till late last night.
Yeah, well,
I'm home, okay?
Well, you can't go.
Well, I sold another painting. I
wanted to celebrate with you.
To what, your one buyer?
Who is this guy anyway? He
probably just buys your stuff
'cause he's into you.
I'm sure you'll just string him
along like you do with Luke.
You really want to
have that conversation?
What's that
supposed to mean?
Simon.
He's like my brother.
I doubt he feels that way.
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go.
No, no, you can't.
This is ridiculous.
Where are you going?
I'm just going
to Java Jones.
Jesus!
Nope, just me.
Come on, Simon.
Clary. There's something
I want to tell you, okay?
We can talk
about this later.
Bye, Mrs. Fray.
Look, suddenly I'm drawing
hundreds of these things,
and I have no idea what they are.
Huh.
I don't know. I think I'm
going out of my mind.
You know, maybe you're like
the guy in  Encounters.
Everybody thought
he was paranoid,
and then there turned
out to be, well...
UFO, reasonable, like...
Oh, God, this
isn't happening.
What?
This isn't happening.
Okay, now you're
freaking me out.
Clary, are you...
SIMON:
What are you looking at?
Wait here.
Where's the Cup, Jocie?
Huh?
How did you find me?
You can thank your
daughter for that.
Why can I see you
and no one else can?
I was going to ask
you the same question.
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.
You're a killer,
a cold-blooded killer.
As opposed to
a peace-loving killer?
I know what I saw.
You think you know.
Why am I drawing this?
So I was right,
you're not a mundane.
Excuse me?
What's a mundane?
Someone from
the human world.
If I'm not a human,
then what am I?
Go find the Cup.
When did this start?
No, no. Why am
I drawing this?
Answer me!
Simon.
Uh-oh.
Maybe you should answer that.
Could be your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
Does he know that?
Please. It's annoying.
Mom, I'm coming home.
No,no,no.
You can't come home.
You understand me?
You don't come home.
You call Luke. Tell him Valentine's
alive and that he found me.
Mom!
No, no!
Mom!
You tell Valentine
he'll never have the Cup.
Don't you... Don't drink...
Come here! Don't... What?
Oh, come on.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You okay?
MAN: All right, look,
don't move, all right?
Mom?
Mom?
Come on. Come on.
That's enough! That's enough.
That's enough.
Shh.
It's dead.
What the hell was that?
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.
Try me.
It was a demon.
You're right.
I don't believe you.
And that thing,
that you saw me kill
at the club, that...
That was also a demon.
Demons can take possession
of any living creature.
You can't trust anyone.
Even people you
think you know.
So, why should I trust you?
I did just save your life.
Dorothea, open up, please.
Can you...
Do you know what
happened to my mom?
Do you?
Wait, you can
see this guy?
Of course she can.
She's a witch.
Downgraded from a gingerbread
house to a one-bedroom?
CLARY: Do you know
where my mom is?
Sorry. I have
no idea.
Well, she mentioned
a name, um... Valentine.
You better leave.
No, please.
Not until you tell me
something, anything.
Let's see what
the cards have to say.
I'm sorry, but you know that
I don't believe in any of...
Sit.
Run your hands
over the cards.
My mom painted these.
Yes. They were a gift.
Let's see which
card gets picked.
DOROTHEA: The Ace of Cups.
That's the Mortal Cup. So?
Ignore him.
It's a Mortal Instrument, one of the
three holy objects of my people.
What's it doing here?
I don't understand what any of
this has to do with my morn.
Your mother was a
Shadowhunter, like him.
No, my mom is a painter.
She never told you
any of this, did she?
Look, all I know is that
she's gone, and I have
no idea where to
start looking for her.
Let me read you.
There's something
blocking your mind.
My guess is your mother hired someone
very skilled to protect you.
From what?
Your own memories.
Why?
I don't remember anything
she'd want me to forget.
Wait.
Nice to meet you.
OW! What the hell?
Ow.
You scared me.
What the hell
happened here?
My mom's missing.
What?
Someone took her and
destroyed the place.
Well... So... Um...
This guy is
helping me find her,
but you can't
see him, and he...
Clary.
Great.
Okay, now I can't
see him, either.
Jace Wayland,
demon hunter.
Uh...
Simon Lewis,
Keymaster.
Are you the
Gatekeeper?
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Wait. What, so you
can see him now?
What? Of course I can see him.
But I thought...
No... What are you
talking about?
This is so confusing.
Who's this?
That's my dad.
He died when I was two.
Clary, a moment.
So, wait, your mom is gone,
and you're hanging around
with some dyed-blond
wannabe Goth weirdo?
Where'd you come
across this guy?
No, I didn't.
He found me.
What? He found you?
No, I know it sounds...
You should check this.
And for the record,
my hair is naturally blond.
Clary, Clary,
Clary... Simon?
She called you?
Why didn't you pick up?
If I'd known it was serious,
I would have picked up.
Well, how would you know
if you didn't pick it up?
What's that?
Nothing good.
Do you have any idea
where she got this?
I've got to find Luke.
It's so weird.
His truck's here.
Come on. This way.
No, you wait here.
Who made you
the boss?
It's okay. Just let us
know if anyone comes.
I've known Luke
all these years,
but I've never
been down here.
What?
PANGBORN: Come on, mate!
PANGBORN: Now, listen...
All you got to do, mate,
is tell me the truth.
LUKE: I'm telling you,
I don't know where the Cup is.
PANGBORN: I know you
and Jocie are close.
I'm not stupid, am I?
Don't answer that.
Listen to me, mate. Just tell
me where the Mortal Cup is.
And then Jocie will be fine.
Lukey, tell me.
Tell me the truth.
LUKE: I don't know.
PANGBORN: You don't
want to make me angry.
LUKE: I'm telling you...
Do you? Hmm?
I'm going to ask you again,
mate, where's the Cup, huh?
I don't know.
PANGBORN: We all want the same
thing, Lukey boy, don't we?
Difference is, I think
you know where it is.
Don't you?
Come on.
Come on. Talk!
We need to go.
No, please, you
have to help him.
You don't understand.
They work for Valentine.
He's a dead man.
I can't help him.
He's like family.
You know what's
really amazing
is how much you actually
look like a human.
Isn't it great? Huh?
Please.
PANGBORN: Are you gonna get mad?
You're going to change?
I want to see you change.
Show me how you
can change. Huh?
Look at that. Look at that.
Dog boy's coming on.
You want to hump my leg?
You hump legs?
You like that?
You want to smell
my derriere?
I want to see you change!
You just got to tell me
where Jocelyn hid the Cup.
Then you can have her back.
She'll be safe and sound.
I don't want her back.
I couldn't care less.
I have spent years
cozying up to that woman
and her brat for
the Mortal Cup.
Pangborn,
listen to me.
I want to be the one to
give her to Valentine.
PANGBORN:
Yeah, right.
You are making
a big mistake.
I don't believe you.
Do you believe him?
Clary, run!
Clary, listen!
Excuse me. Officer?
I'd like to report
a break-in.
And a missing person.
SIMON: My friend's house
got broken into, and...
Her mom's missing.
Oh, no.
Run!
You killed two cops!
They weren't cops.
Let's go!
Clary.
You can't stay here.
They'll find you.
How could Luke say
that he didn't care?
I've known him for as
long as I can remember.
He used to read
to me every night.
He's been picking me
up at school for years.
Look, maybe those
memories aren't real.
Do you remember
what I told you?
You can't trust anyone.
No, I need to find my mom.
I have to go home.
There must be something
that I missed!
Listen to me, okay?
We'll figure this out,
but not here and not now.
We need to get
you to a safe place.
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary, and I
will protect you with my life.
SIMON: There you guys are. I
thought you were right behind me.
I thought
I'd lost you.
Okay. I'll follow you.
SIMON: Are you sure about that?
'Cause he just killed two cops.
Yeah, they weren't cops.
SIMON: They looked
like real cops to me.
They weren't real cops.
Okay.
So, where did
they get the car?
They weren't real cops.
We'll be safe in here.
What is this dump?
This isn't a dump.
You just can't see it.
Hey! on!
ALEC: What the hell is going on?
What are they doing in here?
JACE: It's a demon bite.
SIMON: Clary.
Jace, do something!
Is this the part when
you start tearing off
pieces of your shirt
to bind my wounds?
If you wanted me to take my clothes
off, you should've just asked.
WOMAN:
It's  a fever.
Hey.
Hey, she's waking up.
I passed out,
and you guys tattooed me?
Thought that only
happened in Vegas.
It's not a tattoo.
It's a rune.
They have them
for everything,
they make you invisible,
strong, they heal.
They also make
you visible.
That's why I could
suddenly see him.
Even if you're hungry... No.
The fact that the rune
had an effect on you
explains why
you can see us.
I don't get it.
Mundanes can't
survive the process.
The runes are too
strong for them, so...
Now we definitely know you
have Shadowhunter blood.
SIMON: Wait, it wasn't
definite before?
Well, it became definite
when she didn't die. Yes.
Here, see if these fit.
It's not every day
we get guests in here.
Especially not girls.
Oh. Yeah.
Shouldn't we
call the cops?
I mean, the real ones.
That's a great idea.
I just don't know why we
haven't thought of that
for the past
thousand years.
Hodge is ready for her.
He wants to see her
alone in the library.
Who's Hodge?
He's in charge
of the Institute.
Okay, let's go.
Hundreds of Shadowhunters
used to seek asylum here.
But, as you can see,
right now,
we're the only ones.
Without the Mortal Cup,
we're a dying breed.
Either you're born
of a Shadowhunter,
or you have to drink
from the Mortal Cup.
You coming?
Pretty far from
Brooklyn, isn't it?
Stay away from Jace.
You may find Hodge
a little eccentric,
but he's one of the greatest
Shadowhunters that's ever lived.
Here, give me that.
Don't you think
it's a bit risky
inviting a complete stranger
into the heart of the Institute?
No. I think we
can trust her.
And what about
her mundane friend?
Well, that was impulsive.
When you're impulsive,
things go badly.
Just be careful,
the rune to fix
a broken heart is
the most painful one.
They'll be out of here
in a day, I promise.
ALEC: Jace.
HODGE: She was
one of the best,
your mum.
But I don't
understand why...
Yesterday you were
just a normal girl.
Today you feel as though
your whole world has
been turned upside down.
There's only one
thing you need to know.
The stories you were
told as a little girl
about monsters,
nightmares,
legends whispered
around campfires...
They're all true.
Demon?
Yes.
Demon?
No. Werewolves
aren't demons.
We have a truce
with Downworlders.
Oh. Downworlders?
What is that,
like people below
Well, "Downworlders" pretty
much sums everything up,
vampires, werewolves, warlocks.
Warlocks. Cool.
So, how do you
kill a zombie?
We don't.
Of course,
they're already dead.
No. They don't exist.
Oh.
So, that's the famous Cup
everyone's talking about.
A replica. But yes.
You know, Jace has got a
real chip on his shoulder.
You would, too, if you saw your father
murdered when you were a child.
If it weren't for him,
we'd be dead.
He saved our lives more
times than I care to admit.
Right.
the Crusaders
summoned an angel,
the Angel Raziel.
Raziel poured his
blood into a cup,
and those who drank
from it became
half angel,
half human.
Shadowhunters.
As did their children and
their children's children.
Beings of immense power,
strong enough to
restore balance
and protect the world
in a war against evil.
A war that can
never be won,
but must always
be fought.
Demons don't die easily.
Whereas we,
we remained
all too mortal.
Why didn't they just use the Cup
to create more Shadowhunters?
Valentine's exact words.
The Clave,
the keepers of the Cup,
they were afraid
of using its power.
They knew that hardly anyone
who drank from it survived.
Valentine Morgenstern drew a
circle of friends together,
young, idealistic
Shadowhunters,
to help him steal the
Mortal Cup from the Clave.
But he didn't want
to protect humanity.
He believed there had to be
an evolution of Shadowhunters,
He began experimenting,
using the Mortal Cup.
He learned how
to summon demons.
He even injected himself with demon
blood so he could control them.
and vanished
into thin air.
But if she's the only one that
knows where the Cup is, then...
Maybe she isn't.
Maybe she told
someone else.
Someone who doesn't
know she knows.
The Silent Brothers
are ready for her.
CLARY: Why didn't
Hodge come with us?
He hasn't left the
Institute in years.
Some say it's a spell.
He's agoraphobic.
Is that him?
JACE: No, that's Harold,
the groundskeeper.
That's him.
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?
We will help you
to remember.
Ow!
Shh.
You'll wake
the dead.
I can't believe this place
is just outside the city.
Welcome to the
City of Bones.
This is where the Silent
Brothers draw their power,
from the bones and
ashes of Shadowhunters.
All of them
are buried here?
Yes. One day,
that's gonna be me.
This is as
far as I go.
You'll be fine.
So you've done
this before?
No.
You must listen
with your mind.
Mom?
Mom?
Go. Go.
JOCELYN: Clary, this is Luke,
my dearest friend.
You can trust him.
LUKE: Hi, Clary.
Don't tell.
JOCELYN: Don't touch
that old thing.
It's just an
old cup, Clary.
Clary! Clary,
are you okay?
Clary?
JACE: Your block is
stronger than I anticipated.
It can only be undone by
the one who put it there.
I have no idea
who put it there.
You wrote it.
Your mind remembers
the inverted image.
Just have to look
at it differently.
"B-A-N-E."
Bane.
Who?
Magnus Bane. He's a warlock.
I should have known.
Well, let's go
talk to him then.
Not like that.
We're gonna need some
help from Isabelle.
CLARY: This is a top.
It's a dress.
I can't pull this off.
Well, actually,
with the right shoes...
No, I mean...
This dress is so tight,
it's like a second skin.
Don't you
have anything else?
If you go out looking
like your mundane self,
we won't get within a hundred
feet of Magnus Bane.
He's the High
Warlock of Brooklyn.
Now, stop complaining,
come over here.
Hold this.
That guy Alec doesn't
like me very much.
That guy Alec
is my brother.
Does Jace know how
Alec feels about him?
Is it that obvious?
It's really not
that big of a deal.
It isn't to me either.
But it is to the Clave.
I don't make the rules.
See? You look pretty.
How is being dressed like a hooker
gonna help me find my morn?
Easy now,
those are my clothes.
Doesn't she look
great, Alec?
She looks like someone
whose phone number
should be
on a bathroom wall.
I think you look great.
Wait, I've been here.
Wait.
What?
Is that better?
It's better.
Well, well, well.
Look-a here.
I don't remember inviting any
children of the Nephilim.
Magnus Bane.
We need to talk.
MAGNUS: You know I
don't like you guys.
But I'll let you stay, but
only because of the hot one.
Thanks.
Thank you.
What?
I meant him.
The one with the blue eyes.
And because of Clary.
Wait. How do you
know her name?
Come with me.
Where's your mother?
She's missing.
That explains it.
Every year,
she brought you here.
She never missed
an appointment.
Not every spell turns out as
perfect as the one I did on you.
As soon as you started
drawing the angelic rune,
it was a sign your
memory was surfacing.
I had built
that into your mind
so that she knew
when to bring you back.
What you saw from
the shadow world,
you would forget,
even as you saw it.
But as you grew older, you needed
my treatment more frequently.
She knew she had
to tell you one day,
she wanted to keep
the block on your mind.
It was exactly
how she wanted it.
SIMON: How long do you
think we're gonna be here?
ISABELLE: Relax, Simon, okay?
Don't drink that!
Simon! Simon!
It'll wear off
over time.
It's already wearing off,
or you wouldn't be here.
I need to remember.
My mom doesn't have time. Please,
there must be something you can do.
You're the one who's been
buying all my mom's paintings.
Why did you buy
all of them?
I knew she
needed the money.
You even have
a portrait of my dad.
That's not your dad.
He's a soldier
who died in Iraq.
Jocelyn never
even met the guy.
She was asked to
paint his portrait,
but it was too
painful for the widow.
She kept the
picture so...
She could pretend
he was my dad.
Everything she did,
she did for you.
Your mother's
whole existence,
the running,
the hiding, the lies,
were to keep
you safe.
Was anything she
ever told me true?
There's a treasure map
inside your head, Clary.
Find the Cup, and it will
lead you to your mother.
They've taken Simon.
Who?
Vampires.
Just remember,
it was Shadowhunters your
mother was running from.
CLARY: Let's go find Simon.
ALEC: We can't break into a
vampire's lair, we never learned.
JACE: Don't start again.
Jace, you know the rules.
Guys, what are
we doing here?
I thought we were
trying to find Simon.
We know where he is. We just
need to pick up a few things.
What is this, some kind of
deal you have with the church?
Demons exist all
across the world
in their varying,
different forms.
Shadowhunters cling
to no particular religion,
and in turn all religions
assist us in our battle.
We could have as easily
gone to a Jewish synagogue
temple or...
Here it is.
Beneath every altar
in every church...
...you'll find this.
So, what do you believe in?
JACE: I believe in myself.
I know my job is
to kill demons.
I don't have to
believe in anything else.
What about the
Angel Raziel?
JACE: Yeah, makes
for a nice story.
But Hodge thinks...
Yeah, Hodge.
He needs to get out more.
I thought... Listen,
I've been hunting demons
for over a third
of my life,
and in all that time,
I've never seen an angel.
Here.
Here, you take this one.
I don't...
Here, let me show you.
It's a vampire gun.
Must pierce the heart.
Push it up
against the chest.
Fire.
Recharge. Then you're
good to go again.
CLARY: Hotel of Death?
You can't say they don't
have a sense of humor.
Come on.
What is it about her?
She's brave.
We're Shadowhunters,
we're all brave.
She wasn't raised
like us, she's different.
She's gonna
get us all killed.
Simon's shirt.
He's up here.
Simon.
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, Simon.
Clary.
No, I can feel him!
Give me a hand.
Come on, come on.
These damn boots!
Here.
Here you go.
JACE: Come on.
Guys, steady.
JACE: Slowly.
CLARY: He's alive!
Careful.
Go on. Get out.
They don't want me.
They want you,
they want the Cup.
JACE: Come on. Let's go.
Oh, God.
JACE: Let's go!
No, here.
In here!
Go!
Jace.
Behind you!
Come on! Come on!
SIMON: Clary!
There's too
many of them.
Have a little faith.
Run!
Jace, I need a knife.
CLARY: The sun.
JACE: Let's go.
You help Simon.
Clary!
SIMON: Hold on!
Clary!
Thank you.
For saving Simon.
Are you okay?
I'm okay, I'm okay.
ALEC: Clary.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah, I was just
gonna go see Simon.
I want you to leave here.
What?
You almost got us killed.
I'm sorry,
we didn't have a choice.
I mean, we had to
save Simon, and Jace...
Jace thinks he needs
to save the world.
But you don't need to
encourage him to do it.
But that's what
you guys do.
Yes, us. What we do.
We're a team,
you're deadweight.
A mundane.
I'm not a mundane.
And if you were half as brave as you
pretend to be, you'd admit that...
What?
You'd admit that
you're in love with Jace,
and that's what
this is really about.
If you ever say anything
like that again...
I'll kill you.
Hey.
How long was I out?
All day.
Found your glasses.
One of the lenses cracked. Yeah.
How weird.
I don't seem to
need them anymore.
So, what are you drawing?
Nothing.
You okay?
SIMON: Yeah.
It was crazy.
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you before.
Now I get it.
Mmm-hmm?
Mmm-hmm.
And...
And I must have passed out,
and then you showed up.
Listen,
I know I've always been
the one who needed you
more than you needed me.
That's not true.
Yes, it is,
but I never cared.
I've only ever had
my mom, Luke and you.
Don't ever imagine that you
weren't important to me.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Whoa.
What did that piano
ever do to you?
You play it like you've
lost your only love.
Unfortunately, my one
true love remains myself.
Well, at least you don't have
to worry about rejection.
Not necessarily.
I turn myself down
occasionally just to
keep it interesting.
You do play that
with a lot of passion.
Well, that's the problem. I
play it with too much emotion.
It's supposed to be
played with a simple
representation of notes,
no interpretation.
Music is supposed
to have emotion.
Demons react to certain
frequencies when two tones cross.
Drives them crazy.
See, Bach discovered this and
put it into a system using
a mathematical progression
of tonal combinations
that allows us
to expose demons.
So Bach was
a Shadowhunter?
JACE: Yes.
So...
Bach is to demons what
garlic is to vampires.
Kind of.
I mean, you can
run out of garlic.
You can't really
run out of music.
CLARY: Is that where
you keep all your toys?
It's way more fun.
Come on.
It's a portal.
Like the Bermuda Triangle,
it's a natural phenomenon.
The Institute was
built around it.
Some say that the Institute was
the first building in New York.
Huh. So it's...
Dimensions aren't all
just straight lines.
There's bends,
folds and nooks.
It's a little bit
difficult to explain, but
the Portal can take you wherever
you want to go in this dimension.
So, as soon as you
break that surface,
you're transported to wherever
your deepest thoughts lie.
So that means...
My mom...
Wait.
We spend our entire lives
training how to use it,
visualizing where it will take
us before we step into it,
and that takes
incredible focus.
If you were to step into it
without the proper training,
you could end up in limbo,
lost in your own mind forever.
Here.
Let me show you.
Come on.
No peeking.
Pretty cool, isn't it?
Now...
You and I...
Have a birthday
to celebrate.
How did you know?
Research. When I was
trying to find you.
JACE: No one comes
up here anymore.
We have the place
to ourselves.
CLARY: This is breathtaking.
Sorry there's no cake.
Well, I was
expecting nothing,
so this is great.
Well, everyone should get
something for their birthday.
What did you get?
Weapons mostly.
I'm sure that
doesn't surprise you.
At this point,
nothing really does.
When I was nine...
My father gave
me a falcon.
He told me to
make it obedient.
I was supposed to
keep the bird blind,
but I couldn't bring
myself to do it.
Instead, I touched and stroked
its wings until it trusted me.
I tamed it to perfection.
I took it to my father, expecting
him to be proud of what I'd done.
He said,
"I told you to
make it obedient.
"Instead, you taught
it to love you.
"You didn't tame it,
you broke it."
Then he took the bird
and he broke its neck.
I cried all night and
I never cried again.
Did you ever forgive him?
He did it to
make me stronger.
Does that stand
for Wayland?
Mmm-hmm.
Midnight.
Watch this.
Finds the soul
it was waiting for
When someone walks
into your heart
When your hand
finds the hand...
When a girl says
she wants a big rock,
she doesn't literally
mean a big rock.
JACE: Every Shadowhunter should
have their own witchlight.
We have company.
JACE: That's Hodge's bird.
...that was trapped
inside your soul
We should probably go.
Don't let go
Don't let go
It's like they've been in
your life forever
No, there's
no one else's eyes
Your love lifts
me out of time
And you know
my heart by heart
Yeah.
We should definitely go.
And you know
my heart by heart
And you know
my heart by heart
And you know
my heart by heart
Sorry about
the sprinkler system.
I forgot about that.
You going to sleep?
Well, aren't you tired?
I've never been
more awake.
Simon, I thought you were...
SIMON: Asleep?
Yeah, I was.
Um, we were just...
Next time, it might be
a nice idea to mention
that you already have
a man in your bed,
so we can avoid such
uncomfortable situations.
You invited him to bed?
I know, it's
ridiculous, isn't it?
We would never
have all fit.
I didn't invite
him into bed.
We were just kissing.
How swiftly you
dismiss our love.
Jace...
Simon, it's late, and
I'm sorry we woke you.
So am I.
Go ahead. Go after him,
go apologize to him,
go tell him just how
special he really is.
Stop acting like that!
Like what?
Like nothing ever hurts you.
Well, maybe
you should have thought about
that before you kissed me.
I kissed you?
Don't worry, it wasn't that
special for me either.
I'm really sorry, Simon, but
weren't you just in the...
I was just
looking for you.
Where are you going? Home.
It's clear I
overstayed my welcome.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It
wasn't like it was planned.
Let me guess, it just happened.
Please.
Look, I know you
don't like him, but...
Actually, I hate the guy.
Why?
I thought you were
better than that.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I'm the one who's always
been there for you, not him.
I'm in love with you.
And it's clear that you
don't feel the same way.
It's...
Don't.
There's nothing to say.
And, Clary,
he's just using
you to get the Cup.
Simon...
Your mother was the only other
person who could do that.
But I've never been
able to do this before.
Apparently the block wasn't just
repressing your memories,
but your abilities as well.
Jace, I...
Don't tell me.
You have a drawing emergency
and you need a nude model.
I'm not in the mood. Listen!
I know where my
mom hid the Cup.
Hey.
Hi.
Clary...
Wow, you look different.
Yeah, it's just
something I borrowed.
I mean, nice outfit.
It's good.
Yeah, I can't
talk now. Sorry.
Clary.
I came for the tarot cards.
DOROTHEA: Why?
CLARY: I need them.
You know, the
ones that Mom painted?
I just need to look
at them really quickly,
and I'll give
them back, I promise.
DOROTHEA: Those
can't come in here.
This is a peaceful house.
Put them in there.
How are you
feeling today?
Fine. Just fine.
Young man, that
piano is out of tune.
Please don't.
Young man.
Stop!
That song.
Not one of my favorites.
Stop!
Let's have a look.
Get out!
Oh. Hey, Madame Dorothea.
Have you seen Clary?
I just got a text that
said she was here.
No.
Okay. Well, I'll just...
Simon!
Simon!
Simon!
Simon, it's not really her!
Simon!
Simon!
I'll take care of him.
CLARY: Simon!
She's got the Cup!
Simon!
SIMON: I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Jace!
The runes aren't working.
ISABELLE: Simon,
you follow me.
You cut these up.
Don't. You've
done enough.
Don't talk to her like that.
This isn't her fault.
No, you're right. This is your fault.
Isabelle!
Alec kept telling you that
you were going to get hurt.
You were going
to get us all hurt.
Now he's the one dying.
Well, we needed to
get the Mortal Cup.
But there were other ways to do it
than getting your best friend killed.
Why don't you
go get Hodge.
I never wanted anything
to happen to Alec.
I'm sorry.
We agreed to do this together.
We're a team.
Since Clary got here,
we haven't been a team.
Hodge!
Hodge!
Alec's getting worse.
I know.
I've already
sent for someone.
Did you get the Cup?
What now?
Hodge?
You have no idea
what it's like
living with the
Clave's curse,
unable to set so much
as a foot outside,
afraid to even
open a window.
Try not to judge me
too harshly, Clary.
Hodge, what have you done?
I always knew you
would bring me the Cup.
It was only
a matter of time.
Where is she?
She's fine.
You got what you want.
Now let her go.
I have to make sure
you gave me the real one.
Everybody wants the Cup
for the wrong reason.
And you don't?
VALENTINE: With this Cup,
I can cleanse
our bloodlines,
save our race.
You might not know much
about mundane history,
but I can tell you when
people start talking
about preserving a race,
it never goes well.
That's why my mom spent her
whole life hiding it from you.
No.
She wasn't hiding the Cup.
She was hiding you.
Drink.
I'm not gonna drink that.
Why are you so afraid?
You've been drinking this
since before you were born.
I fed it to your mother
while you were in her womb.
Oh, come on, Clary.
You must have
guessed by now.
All these amazing talents
that your mother so desperately
tried to suppress,
where do you think
they came from?
You're my daughter.
My blood runs
in your veins.
Now...
Drink.
Drink!
Take that out!
No!
Someone just went
through the Portal.
I'll go check.
Sorry.
I got a bit carried away.
Luke, you're a...
Clary, listen to me, listen.
Don't be afraid.
Listen, right?
Don't touch me!
Hey, there's no
need for that.
That thing will be back.
We are not
safe out here.
I jumped through the Portal
to get away from Valentine.
I thought I'd end
up with my mom.
Instead, I ended up in the
last place I wanted to be.
Listen, the Portal
brought you here
because you must have
been thinking of me.
Deep inside, you know
you can trust me.
You said you couldn't careless
what happened to either of us.
You just want the Cup,
like everyone else.
I said that to protect you.
What else could I do?
Been keeping an eye
on you this whole time.
That was you at the hotel.
Good throw, by the way.
What about me?
What about you?
We had a deal.
Well, I still don't
have my Cup, do I?
I held up my end
of the bargain.
No, you didn't.
I gave you the Cup.
You handed it to Clary.
That's not my fault.
Now lift it.
Listen, it's all
in your head.
No. No!
There's a spell.
Really? A spell?
That's just an excuse
for a real problem
in there.
Do you really think
I can fix that?
I give you the Cup,
you take away the fear.
Without the Cup,
I'm as stuck as you are.
Except my fear is real.
Every Downworlder,
every member
of the Clave,
every Shadowhunter on
both sides of the Portal
is looking for
me right now.
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.
You don't have to go through
with this, Valentine.
A demon has never set
foot in the Institute.
Well, maybe it's
time they did.
I've been waiting all
these years to do this.
Clary's given me no choice.
She'll come back.
Really?
And what makes
you so sure?
There's someone here she
wants as much as her mother.
If you lie and tell them
they're both your children,
you'll break
their hearts.
What can I say?
The broken make
the best followers.
Look at you.
To love is to destroy.
ISABELLE:
Where the hell is Hodge?
We don't have much time.
SIMON: Does this look right to you?
ISABELLE: No.
Hey, look.
Hey!
Magnus?
I'm going to need all of this.
Lots of it.
Take this.
Lock this place down.
Those who are not allies
must be killed.
Don't do that!
Valentine.
Jonathan.
How do you know
my real name?
Nobody calls me that.
Is it true?
Is Valentine my father?
You know,
he was a great man,
until his conflict
with the Clave.
But when your mother
ran away with the Cup,
he was just so afraid of
retribution from the Clave,
he burned their
house down to the ground.
He wanted the world
to believe he was dead.
In the ashes, we found
the remains of a man
Wait a second,
there was a child?
Valentine was so enraged,
he wanted her to believe
he killed himself
and their son,
your brother.
I have a brother?
Jonathan Christopher
Morgenstern.
You're lying.
My name is Jace Wayland.
And my family
are the Waylands.
You think Clary is the only
one with a block in her mind?
Let me show
you the truth.
You didn't tame him.
You broke him.
No! You...
You are not my father.
I came back to help you
understand who you really are.
I know you're unhappy here.
Plagued by rules.
Your place
is next to me.
You're a Morgenstern.
And you're my son.
My name is Jace Wayland.
I'm a Wayland.
VALENTINE: Sorry
to break this to you,
but it's time you
heard the truth.
Don't.
VALENTINE: It's all
a matter of perception.
You see, Morgenstern.
Take this.
Okay.
Okay.
Isabelle.
Yeah, we found your mom.
They found her.
She's at the Institute.
Alaric.
Yeah, I see it.
Hey, guys,
we have to go.
Luke needs us.
Where are we headed?
The Institute.
We'd be breaking the accords.
Not if we stay human.
ALARIC: Let's go, guys!
MEN: Go, go, go, go!
ALARIC: Come on, move it!
Ready to go!
They've all been briefed.
This is Alaric.
He's one of us.
Go ahead.
You can hang your head out
the window if you need to.
I'm a werewolf
not a golden retriever.
ISABELLE: Simon!
Just wait here,
I'll be back.
What? No. Isabelle,
I can't just...
No. Isabelle!
Come on, Isabelle,
where are you?
ALARIC: All right, move it!
Come on, move it!
Whoa.
All right.
The werewolves
are here to save us.
Never thought I'd say that.
Hey.
Finally! Isabelle.
PANGBORN: Hey,
open up the door.
It looks like
he's responding.
He'll survive.
Oh, and be careful.
You're being invaded.
PANGBORN: Summoning all
these bloody demons...
Run!
Run!
Where are we going?
There's another exit!
Wait. Oh...
Isabelle!
I almost killed you.
Yeah.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Come on.
This place is
full of demons.
That's impossible.
The Institute is
hallowed ground.
Yeah, no one seems
to have told them that.
Someone on the inside
must have let them in.
This is a
rescue mission.
We are not equipped
to fight demons.
MAN 1: Spread out!
MAN 2: That way! That way!
Move back! Come on!
We could use some
help here, Alaric!
Alaric!
Come on, there must be some
other way out of here, right?
No, there isn't, Simon!
LUKE: We can't hold
them much longer!
Step away.
Step away!
Clary, which rune is that?
I don't know, it's just...
I've never seen it before.
Really?
It's not in the book.
It's fading.
Here, they're coming
in through somewhere.
I'm going to stop them.
Come on.
You guys go.
We'll catch up.
No!
They're coming from the dome.
Come on.
Jocelyn,
you never left my heart.
I've come to take you home.
She's not going anywhere.
How did you get up here?
You're even more powerful
than I anticipated.
Get away from her.
What the hell?
Just listen to
what he has to say.
It's not
what you think.
Finally...
Both my children together.
My daughter
and my son.
I'm so sorry, Clary.
I didn't know.
Valentine's lying.
You're Michael Wayland's son.
Luke said my brother is dead.
He died in a fire,
and they found his
remains in the ashes.
I took Jonathan
with me when I ran.
The bones were of
a child killed by wolves.
I wish it wasn't true.
She doesn't want
to believe you
because she is in
love with you, Jonathan.
I thought your
name was Jace.
Jace is a nickname.
Jonathan Christopher...
J.C.
Jace.
ISABELLE: There's the lever.
You go close the dome
and I'll hold them off.
Take out the Cup, Clary.
Take out my Cup!
I want that Cup!
You said you
wouldn't hurt her!
Enough!
That's enough.
Now!
It's stuck!
Close it!
I can't!
I think there's
a piece missing!
Clary!
I really need this.
Mom?
Find the others.
All right.
All right, you want to take
the upstairs or the down?
I'm not too crazy
about the basement.
ISABELLE: I can't hold
them back any longer!
Simon, hurry!
PANGBORN: Oh, Clary!
Hello, Mr. Garroway.
Looks like you're
having a rough day, eh?
I guess the humane thing
to do in this situation
would be to put you down.
But you wanted
to see me change.
I do.
Get up!
So, boy, how far do
you want to take this?
Huh?
To the end.
Simon!
Isabelle!
Hey.
Lean on me.
Get out! Go on!
Get out of here.
Come on!
HODGE: Go!
Somebody told me that
you like to play music.
Johann would be very proud.
Now you shall die
by Raziel's sword.
Stop!
Or I'll drop it!
You don't want
to do that.
Don't give it
to him, Clary.
I need you to listen to me.
As your father,
I'm begging you.
If you'd been a real dad,
you'd know me well enough to
imagine where the Cup is,
where my deepest
thoughts are taking it.
You don't know the
first thing about me.
You're not my dad...
And you never will be.
I promise, you'll never
have to see me again.
Thank you, Clary.
Without this Cup,
we are lost.
Not "we."
You.
Ah!
JACE: Clary!
No! Don't let go!
Never!
Here!
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I understand why
you did what you did.
And I forgive you.
I want you to know,
your secret's safe with me.
Hey.
Hey.
So, how's she doing?
Stable.
The doctors don't
know what she took,
so we just have to wait.
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm an
old romantic.
I always hoped that
when I finally said,
"I love you" to someone, she'd
say the same thing back.
And that someone will.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, you're tired.
Go sleep, we'll
take care of her.
Yeah, come on.
That this light
will guide you home
I like what you've
done with the place.
I've got a few
tricks up my sleeve.
Clary, we're afraid
you're not coming back.
It's just really hard
to be around you right now.
It's hard for me as well.
But this is about
more than us.
You have an incredible
gift, and we need you.
I need you.
I just don't know.
Remember when I said
I'd never seen an angel?
Well, I lied.
You're still the bravest
mundane I've ever met.
I'm not a mundane.
Wait, Jace!
You took your time.
That this light
will guide...
You said you needed me.
You should
keep that safe.
Yeah.
Is it okay if I, um...
Do I...
Is it okay if I... Yeah.
Look, Clary,
I don't believe it.
It doesn't feel like the
truth, not in my heart.
I just don't know how to
look at the world anymore.
I don't see streets and
traffic lights and cars.
I see demons and angels.
Everything's different.
The world's the same.
You're the one
who's different.
Don't you remember
what Hodge said?
What?
All the stories are true.
For when the
darkness comes
Only bring your pretty
frightful gifts to me
Let's love
and kill like 17 now
We could unfreeze
this moment
We'll leave
no heart unbroken
Only bring your pretty
frightful gifts to me
Let's love and kill
like 17 now
I'm in love
with your new screams
Only bring those pretty
frightful things to me
Let's run and kill
like 17 now
Let's run and kill
like 17 now
Let's love and kill
like 17
