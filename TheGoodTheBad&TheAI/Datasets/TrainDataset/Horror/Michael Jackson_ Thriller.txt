Honestly, we're out of gas.
So, what are we going to do now?
l'm sorry l didn't believe you.
Could l ask you something?
What?
You know l like you, don't you?
Yes.
And l hope you like me
the way l like you.
Yes.
l was wondering if...
you would be my girl.
Oh, Michael.
lt's beautiful.
Now it's official.
l have something
l want to tell you.
Yes, Michael?
l'm not like other guys.
Of course not.
That's why l love you.
No. l mean l'm different.
What are you talking about?
Are you all right?
Get away!
"Sheriff, he's over here."
"My God, look at that thing."
"Look out!"
Can we get out of here?
No. l'm enjoying this.
Well, l can't watch.
Excuse me.
"Scrawled in blood."
"What's it say?"
''See you next Wednesday.''
lt's only a movie.
lt's not funny.
You were scared, weren't you?
l wasn't that scared.
Yeah. You were scared.
lt's close to midnight
And something evil's
a-lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that
almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound
before you make it
And you start to freeze
As horror looks you
right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
You hear the door slam
And realize there's
nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if
you'll ever see the sun
And you close your eyes
And hope that this
is just imagination
Girl
But all the while
You hear a creature
creepin' up behind
You're out of time
They're out to get you
There's demons closin' in
on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change
that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and l
to cuddle close together
Yeah
All through the night
l'll save you
from the terror on the screen
l'll make you see
Darkness falls across the land.
The midnight hour
is close at hand.
Creatures crawl
in search of blood...
to terrorize
y'all's neighborhood.
And whosoever shall be found...
without the soul
for getting down...
must stand and face
the hounds of Hell...
and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench
is in the air,
the funk of 40,000 years,
and grisly ghouls
from every tomb...
are closing in
to seal your doom.
And though you fight
to stay alive,
your body starts to shiver,
for no mere mortal can resist...
the evil of the thriller.
