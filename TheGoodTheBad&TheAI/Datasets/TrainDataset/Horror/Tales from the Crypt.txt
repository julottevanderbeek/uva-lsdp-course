Stay as close as you can, please.
In the reign of Henry VIII...
when the monasteries
in England were dissolved...
and the occupants tortured...
beheaded in public
or murdered secretly...
some went into hiding
to worship as they pleased.
It is the decaying bodies and skeletons
of these religious martyrs...
that you will see on your tour.
These catacombs are dangerous.
And I must warn you
to stay with me...
and not lose your way.
- My brooch!
- Hmm?
I must have dropped it somewhere.
Thank you.
Well, which way shall we go?
Well, it's a toss-up.
Let's try this way.
- Dead end.
- Sorry. Wrong guess.
Well, there's no way out of here.
Let's go back.
- Who are you?
- Where did you come from?
All in good time.
Look, how do we
get out of here?
- All in good time.
- I'm in a hurry!
It can wait.
- It really can't wait. I have an appointment.
- Sit.
All of you.
Please sit down.
Sit down.
What purpose?
Why did you come in here?
I don't know.
I was just driving by and...
something made me.
And what are your plans
when you leave here?
Plans?
Plans.
"ToJoanne.
The best wife in the world.
Love from Richard."
And a big kiss.
-
Merry Christmas.
Just a minute, darling.
//
- I'm coming, Carol!
- Carol, darling, what's the matter?
- Did Santa come yet?
No, darling, not yet.
You be a good girl and go on to sleep.
- Can I see him when he comes?
- We'll see.
Now you be a good girl and go to sleep.
Otherwise, Santa won't come.
- What's this?
- Nothing. Just a Christmas card from Daddy.
- All right? Good night.
- Good night, Mummy.
- Night, Daddy!
A man described
as a homicidal maniac...
has escaped from the hospital
for the criminally insane.
-
-
##
Blood.
Carol.
Carol!
Carol! Carol.
Carol, where are you?
Carol. Carol!
He's here, Mummy!
I let him in. It's Santa!
Nonsense.
I have no inten-
Hadn't you?
And you?
I'm on my way home
to see my wife and children.
- And then?
- Hmm?
And then?
And then?
- Well, I'm all set.
- Must you go tonight, Carl?
Can't you leave it
till the morning?
No, I'm afraid I can't.
My appointment's in the morning.
I'll have to drive all night to make it.
When will you be back?
I, uh- I don't know.
We'll have to see how it works out.
I'll, um- I'll phone you.
Did you say good night
to the kids?
No. I was just going to.
Good night, Daddy.
Good-bye, darling.
Don't forget to ring me
when you get there.
I will. Good-bye, darling.
- Bye. Drive carefully.
- Yes, right.
The removal men came this morning.
Yeah, well, so I see.
- It should all be there by the time we get there.
- Yeah.
- A shame to give up a nice flat like this.
- Yes, I know that, darling.
But we've both had to give up
quite a bit, haven't we?
I love you, Susan.
You know that, don't you?
Yes, of course I do.
You meet someone,
and suddenly that's it.
I kissed my kids tonight
and- and-
Oh, for hell's sake! I mean, it will
be worth it, won't it, for both of us?
Of course it will.
You are tired.
Let me drive.
Yeah, okay.
No. No.
No. No!
No. No!
I'm sorry. Bad dream.
- Look out!
You crazy fool!
Do you want to get yourself kill-
-
What's the matter then?
Look.
- Well, pull yourself together. What's the matter?
-
Come on now.
- Yes?
- Who is it?
Carl?
Carl- It can't be.
Carl was-
Please go away.
I brought it back
after the crash.
- And I was blinded.
I'm sorry. Bad dream.
- Look out!
So that is why
you were in a hurry?
- What do you mean?
How do you-
Who are you?
I assure you,
I have a purpose.
- What sort of game are you playing?
You're trying to
frighten us in some way.
What do you want?
To show you something.
Something you are capable
of doing.
I don't wanna know.
Oh, but you must know.
You must.
Thank you.
- We knew it was you.
- You knew it was me?
Dear old Punch though,
he's very nice, isn't he?
Ah, I know some of you
have to get home rather soon.
So there's your little present,
my dear. There.
- Thank you, Mr. Grimsdyke.
- That's all right.
Now shall I tell you something?
My wife's name was Helen. Mary Helen Grimsdyke.
I always called her Helen.
It's a nice name, isn't it? Yeah.
- Bye-bye then.
- Come on, Mark. Come on, Julie.
Come and sit here.
Bye-bye, Mark. Bye-bye, Julie.
-
- Bye.
Bye.
Two little dickey birds
sitting on a wall.
One named Peter.
One named Paul.
Fly away, Peter.
Fly away, Paul.
Come back, Peter.
Come back, Paul.
That's it.
You think you could do that?
What are you looking at?
Grimsdyke, of course.
His usual shell out
to the kids.
He does it every year
on his birthday.
- I don't know how you stand it.
- Stand what?
Living across the road
from that man.
He's a rubbish collector.
A dustman.
His place is an eyesore.
The toys he give those kids he finds
in the rubbish heap and repairs.
- Why doesn't he sell out?
- I've made him offers.
He's- He's sentimental
about that old dump.
Says he and his wife lived there
for their whole married life.
And now he wants to die there,
just as she did.
Well, it ruins the neighborhood
and depreciates the value of our property.
The inside must be like a pigsty.
He owns the place
free and clear.
- Bye-bye. See you tomorrow. Shut the gate.
-
Bye-bye.
Isn't there?
What on earth
have you been doing?
Somebody's just made an awful mess
of Mr. Baker's garden.
Poor Grimsdyke's neighbor.
He was so proud of his prize roses.
It's Grimsdyke's dogs for sure.
This is too much. I'd like to make
an official complaint.
-
They're my friends.
Sergeant, please.
It's a court order,
and they don't have licenses.
- I couldn't afford licenses.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Grimsdyke.
Sergeant, please.
Are you there, darling?
Are you there, darling?
Can you hear me?
Is there any- anything
you wish to tell me?
Ah!
Give me the message.
D- D-
Wait.
Danger. Danger?
Who to? Who to?
Is it one of the children?
Just think it over, Councillor Ramsey.
Grimsdyke's due
to retire in two years.
He's done his job well.
There's no reason why the town council-
He's too old.
Don't you think a younger man-
He'd lose his retirement pay.
And save the town some money.
Poor old Grimsdyke.
I do believe he's out of a job.
Hmm.
Flowers are a little wilted,
aren't they, my dear?
God bless you.
Plenty more in the garden.
I'll get you some tomorrow.
Oh!
-
-
Jamie! Jamie!
My littleJamie.
Oh, I wondered
where you were.
Oh, I'm so glad they didn't get you.
Welcome home. Oh.
Better save money now, hadn't we?
Hey, look. Helen, look who's come back.
Our littleJamie.
Ah, that's wonderful. You're our only
friend now. You and the children.
We thought it might be neighborly
to let you know what was going on.
It's very kind of you to draw
our attention to this, Mr. Elliot.
It's so difficult to know what one's children
get up to when they're out of one's sight.
You can tell from looking at his house
what a filthy old man he is.
Constantly filling it with children.
Heaven knows what
his motivations are.
Now don't forget what I said.
Just stay away from him.
But, Mummy,
he's such a nice old man.
Don't argue with me.
You're not to see him again ever.
Why don't you go and play
in our garden?
And don't take
any more sweets from him.
Carrying rubbish all day.
His house must be filthy.
You and your Mr. Grimsdyke. Now, remember,
I don't want you to go anywhere near him.
- Oh, Mum-
- And that's final.
I don't understand it.
Everyone was so kind.
Now this. No work.
No children.
No one to make toys for.
Well, never mind.
We've always got each other,
haven't we, my dear?
Mmm. That's all that matters.
Just one more turn
of the screw...
and he'll sell his property
for next to nothing.
What's on your mind?
Valentine's Day.
- So?
We'll send him valentines...
from everyone in town.
- Oh.
- Lots of mail for you today, Mr. Grimsdyke.
Good morning.
Thank you very much.
Well, how very kind.
My dear, look.
It's not even Christmas, is it?
Not that it makes any difference
if it is or not.
Who could be writing to us?
Let's see here.
Oh! It's a valentine card.
But you're my only sweetheart.
Who can this be?
"Noisy are children,
loud is a bell...
pungent is perfume,
but you only smell."
Hmm?
"Noisy are children, loud is a bell...
pungent is perfume,
but you only smell."
Why, I don't think I like that.
Let's see what we have here.
"A tree is beautiful
if its owner prunes it...
"but our town isn't...
'cause your presence ruins it."
Oh.
"Some people live in the country.
"Some people live in the town.
"Why don't you do us a service?
Jump in the river and-"
What's Grimsdyke been
doing to that mongrel?
He hasn't stopped
whining for a week.
You know, come to think of it...
I haven't seen Grimsdyke for days.
Not since Valentine's Day.
He can't be far away
if the door's open.
This place is spotless.
I thought it'd be filthy.
-
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear brother"-
Arthur Edward Grimsdyke.
"Here departed.
"We therefore commit
his body to the ground.
- "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...
"dust to dust.
It was kind of you
to pay for the burial.
It was the least I could do.
He was a neighbor.
What's that?
Valentine's cards.
The ones left over
from last year when-
- Must be a year ago.
- Today.
It's Valentine's Day.
February the 14th.
Ayear ago exactly.
I'm going to bed.
See you in the morning.
Night.
Night.
"You were mean...
"and cruel...
"right from the start.
"Now you really have...
no"-
It's true.
I didn't-
like Grimsdyke.
What am I doing here?
Well, that's it, Ralph, I'm afraid.
It's all gone.
than everything. You have debts.
I did warn you, didn't I, not to use the money
that had been entrusted to you?
- The risks were far too great.
- The risks?
The gains could've been enormous.
What do I do now?
Well, you have two choices.
First, bankruptcy.
And according to you,
that would be dishonorable, wouldn't it?
Oh, come on.
Let's face it.
You've done dishonorable things
in your life before, in your business life.
Hard, ruthless-
oh, perhaps even cruel.
Yes, to build up theJason empire,
sometimes I had to be.
- No one has to be.
- I did.
Oh, it's easy to talk, but I had to fight
my way up the hard way.
But I always paid my debts.
No, I'm not going
into bankruptcy.
you'll have to start selling things,
things of value-
properties, your paintings-
everything.
My house? All the beautiful things
I've acquired during the years?
It's the only way.
I won't do it.
I'm afraid you'll have to.
We have to sell.
Oh, I know it's a blow.
Our whole life's in them.
Everything we've collected all over the world.
I remember that one.
We got it in that strange
shop in Hong Kong...
when you were selling guns to-
Do you remember what the little man
in the shop said to us when he sold it to us?
Yes. "Use it"-
"Use it wisely."
Hmm! I wonder what
he meant by that.
Ralph, have you-
have you ever seen this writing that's inscribed
on the bottom of this statuette?
- Writing?
- Hmm, yes, here at the base.
"Three wishes I give
and no more...
"to each owner of me...
"so keep score.
"Each wish will come true...
so take care what you do."
I can't read the rest,
but the last word is...
- "deplore."
- What does it all mean?
"Use it wisely."
If only it could give us three wishes.
That's storybook nonsense.
- But it reminds me of a tale
I once read. What was it?
- "The Monkey's Paw." That's what it was.
- I wish-
I read it when I was at school.
I wish for lots
and lots of money.
- Oh, no, no!
- Too late. I already have.
And I've just remembered
what happened at the end of the story.
Why, you said yourself,
it was just a story-
- like our three wishes.
Hello? Oh, hello, Charles.
- I'd like you to come down to my office.
- What, right now?
- Yes, straightaway.
- What's it all about?
It's very important.
It's about money.
I'd like you to come straightaway.
I'll be right there.
That's Charles. He wants me
to go and see him right away.
- He said something about money.
- Money?
- Maybe our wish will come true after all.
- In his car?
- Yes, on the road about 10 miles from his home.
Well, uh, have you told Enid-
Mrs. Jason yet?
No, not yet.
We found some letters
from you in his pocket.
They indicate that you're not only his solicitor
but a close friend of the family.
We thought it better
that you break the news.
Yes, yes. Yes, of course.
Leave it to me.
- I'll tell her.
- Thank you, sir.
Ralph? Dead?
They found him in
the wreckage of his car.
He'd obviously lost control,
skidded.
Enid, this may not be the best moment
to talk about this, but, uh...
it may alleviate
some of your other worries.
You realize this accident
makes you a rich woman.
Rich?
Ralph's insurance.
He always carried a large policy...
with a double indemnity
against accident.
Oh, Charles, I wished for lots and lots
of money. Ralph warned me not to.
- No, that's a coincidence, surely.
- No, it's no coincidence.
That statuette-
It gave us three wishes.
I used one of them to wish
for lots and lots of money.
Now I'm going to wish
for Ralph back.
Charles.
Do you know the story
of"The Monkey's Paw"?
That's the story of the old couple
who are given a monkey's paw...
which entitles them
to three wishes.
They wish for money,
and they get the money...
in a machine in his factory, crushed.
- Enid. You mustn't wish Ralph back.
- Why not?
Well, in the story, this mother wishes
her son back, and he does come back...
but in the condition in which he died-
mutilated, mangled, torn.
I shall wish that Ralph were back
as he was before the accident.
I wish...
Ralph were back exactly as he was...
immediately before the accident.
- Open it! Quickly!
- No, no. Don't look.
His body was mangled
in the crash.
Mangled?
It wasn't mangled.
I wished to bring him back as he was
immediately before the accident.
But he was already dead- dead from
a heart attack. So the accident didn't kill him.
- Only one more wish.
- Enid-
- Please go away. Leave me alone.
- Please-
I want to be alone
with him, please.
Only one more wish.
Only one.
I mustn't waste it.
I must be careful.
Oh, please, please...
I wish Ralph were alive now.
I don't want him to die ever.
I want him moving,
breathing, talking, alive-
now, forever!
- Ralph!
- Oh, Enid!
Ralph! Charles!
- What's happened?
- Oh!
-  What have you done?
I wished alive again- forever!
Don't you realize he's been embalmed?
His veins are filled with embalming fluid...
- burning into him!
- Oh, no!
Enid! Do something!
For God's sake, Enid!
Help me!
No, no! Enid, don't!
- Aah! Aah!
-
But don't you see?
You wished him alive forever!
Alive and- and suffering...
- What did he see?
- What's more important is what you will see.
Who are you?
What do you want with us?
- To warn you of what may happen.
- I don't care about your warnings.
- I want to get out of here.
- Very well.
But you should heed the warning.
- Mr. Rogers?
Rogers.
Show me to my quarters and have somebody
get my kit in, will you?
- Shane, here.
-
Good boy.
There were pictures on the wall.
Where have they gone?
Personal property
of your predecessor, sir.
Well, we must get some more.
I'll go down to London,
have a look around the galleries.
Where are the men-
uh, the patients?
They've gone to lunch, sir.
You mean dinner, don't you?
Mr. Carter.
Thank you, Harry.
Good morning.
I've been appointed your new superintendent
here, and take up my duties today.
I hope we'll all get along well.
If there are any complaints...
I shall be pleased to deal with them
in my office at any time.
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
Morning.
- Shane.
Well, Shane...
after I've made a few changes...
I think we're gonna like it here.
Stone cold.
- It's always like that now.
-
All right, old boy?
All right.
I'll get you an extra blanket.
- Yes?
The men have asked me
to come and talk to you.
Yes?
It's about the heating.
It's been very cold these past few nights.
We wondered if you-
For reasons of economy, the heating is now
turned off each evening at 2000 hours.
You should all be in bed by then.
After all, there's no point in staying up.
- The beds are cold.
I'm trying to run this place
as efficiently and as economically as I can.
I'm afraid the current budget
does not include the costs of new blankets.
Do you know anything
about blind people?
No, I can't say I do,
until I took over this job.
But I was in the army for over 20 years,
and I learned to handle all kinds of men there.
With all due respect, sir,
we are not soldiers.
We have lost one sense...
but the loss of that one sense
only tends to sharpen the others.
Do you know what that means?
If food is bad,
it tastes worse to us.
If a room is dirty,
we feel every speck.
If an insect scurries
across the floor, we hear it.
Why don't you sell that painting
and buy us fuel or extra blankets?
I was not aware that the administration
of expenditure for this establishment...
had been handed over to you,
Mr. Carter.
Good morning.
- Dishwater.
- Filthy muck.
There's no meat in it.
Sorry, dad,
there ain't no more.
No second helping?
Well, rations were cut, you see?
Superintendent says he's doing the best
he can with prices so high.
It's customary to knock
on the door of a private office.
What do you want?
Can't you see I'm having my lunch?
What is it? Nice juicy steak,
while we get nothing but slop?
I do the best I can for you within the limits
of the budget provided for me.
- But you eat meat... and drink wine.
- I am the officer in charge.
- This isn't the bloody army!
- Mr. Carter!
In the kingdom of the blind,
even the one-eyed man is king.
- Shane!
-
Here.
Doctor.
Get a doctor.
Do you realize it's gone midnight?
Doctor! Who wants a doctor?
It's Greenwood, sir.
Well, can't it wait till the morning?
He's ill, sir. Very ill.
Well, I suppose
I'd better take a look.
Shane, wait.
Blanket.
Well, which one is Greenwood?
The man is dead.
Very well.
Shane?
Shane?
Shane?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Go back to your rooms, all of you!
It's our turn to
give the orders now...
Major Rogers, sir.
Well, what-what is it? What-
Wh-What do you want?
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
- Shane.
Shane.
All right, boy.
All right. All right, boy.
What are you doing to my dog?
What are you doing to my dog?
Let me go!
Let me go!
Your dog seems to be getting hungry,
Major Rogers.
Feed him, please.
Please, feed him.
All in good time.
Yes, but you must feed him.
He- He'll be dangerous. He'll go wild, berserk!
I know, Major Rogers, sir.
What are you... doing out there?
You'll see... soon enough.
Look, give me something to eat,
please. Please!
I haven't had anything to eat or drink
for over two days. Please, please!
Well, at least feed my dog, please!
He'll be fed, all right...
Major Rogers, sir.
Aah!
Aah!
You-
What is all this?
I'm on my way to a new job.
I don't know...
why I stopped here.
Now you may go.
But how can we-
Where are we?
In a place where people go
who have died without repentance.
You see,
I wasn't warning you...
but telling you why you are here...
for all eternity.
And now...
who's next?
Perhaps you?
