Gloria.
Man:
Glo.
What?
Gloria?
Gloria, babe, we got to go.
Jesus!
-
-
Man:
Yo, yo, man.
You okay?
Yo.
I-- I didn't
even see him.
Woman: He just walked
right into it.
Somebody was hit by a car.
He needs an ambulance.
I don't know.
He just ran into...
Woman:
Babe, you ready?
Alicia?
Come on, we got to go.
Got to go. Got to go.
You got five minutes.
Did I say come in?
Jesus, Mom.
- Don't slam the door.
- Man:
Should have got your ass
out of bed 30 minutes ago.
-
- Man:
How's that working out, babe?
Ye of little faith.
Ye of no faith.
You know the plumber's
card's on the fridge.
-
- That guy the Poirers use.
Yeah.
She ready yet?
Alicia, come on!
You know she won't eat that.
It's gluten-fricking-free.
I think I just
saved us 300 bucks.
Leak fixed.
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm.
- Really?
- Good morning.
- You fixed it?
- Mm-hmm.
- So hot.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Okay.
- Get it.
Hello.
He has a bruised rib,
contusions.
Physically, your son is lucky,
but I'm more worried about--
- Woman: Toxicology?
- There's that, yes, but--
- Heroin's his drug of choice.
What did he take? - He's over 18, ma'am.
I can't tell you any more
than I could tell the police.
They're here?
You should have led with that.
Nick presented as delusional, Mrs.
Clark.
Witnesses said he ran
into traffic with intent.
- He was high.
- He was ranting.
We had to restrain him.
I requested a psych consult.
- She's not listening.
- She heard you.
Police officer:
Nick.
-
- I went for a walk.
You were running, Nick.
I went for a run.
Barefoot, down "Needle Alley"?
Man, Kenyans run barefoot.
Uh-huh. You said
someone got hurt.
You remember that? You
were raving about "flesh
and blood and viscera."
Um, it's runner's high.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know
what "viscera" is.
Tell us where you scored.
Lots of kids
buying in that hood.
We clean it up,
you come out a hero.
Nick, you could have died.
Yeah, coulda, woulda, shoulda.
Police officer: Okay, we'll
take it from the top.
- Nick, why were you running?
- Is my son under arrest?
- No, ma'am.
- Then get out. Thank you. Leave.
- We could charge him.
- Well, charge him when he's healed.
- For now, go away.
- She do all the talking?
Get the--
get out.
I'm not as eloquent.
What happened?
L.A. is not
a pedestrian-friendly city.
- Nick.
- I just tried to beat the light.
Why the restraints?
I don't know.
Ask the lab coat.
Did you try to hurt yourself?
Nick:
All right, I'm gonna
call for a bed.
No, no, no.
Mom, no.
- Hey, I'm not going back.
- It's how we help you.
- No, we can't help me.
- Listen to your mother, Nick.
You definitely can't help me.
- Hey.
- You can't do shit.
- Madison:
- Nick:
-
- He's just--
None of you can--
can you just leave me alone?
- Can you just let me go?
- There's an idea.
- Alicia, not helpful.
- I'm not trying to help, Travis.
- What did you say?
- It's none of his business anyway.
- You know what? Go to the car. Go.
- Travis:
- Please just leave me alone.
- Everyone take a breath, huh?
- Travis:
-
Tell me what happened. It's just you and me.
Glad you moved in?
Yeah.
- Liza.
- Did you find him?
Travis: Yeah, wanted
to let you guys know.
- He okay?
- Banged up, but he'll recover.
Liza:
Yeah.
Liza: You gonna be
okay for the weekend?
What do you mean?
Can you still take Christopher?
- I don't want to go.
- Chris, it's Dad's weekend.
Well, I get a say in this
and I don't want to go.
Let me talk to him.
Well, maybe I don't want
you here, Mr. Unpleasant.
Maybe I have plans.
Chris: I'll stay at Dante's.
Look, I'm not gonna go
- Liza:
- Let me talk to him.
Please.
Talk to your father.
I don't want to come.
Well, it's my weekend.
Fine, Dad.
Force me.
Let's bond. What do you got
planned for the weekend?
Come on, I'm doing
the best I can.
Yeah, but that really
doesn't help.
We're all building
a family, okay?
All of us. Now, coming
here to support Nick's
- not the worst thing.
-
He's not my friend
and he's not my brother.
He'd be there for you.
He wouldn't have
to be there for me.
Not like that. No.
Chris:
Well?
Um-mmm.
Keep him.
Woman on P.A.:
Madison:
Hey.
Was that Liza?
Yeah.
She sends her love.
Or something resembling love.
Oh, I've got
college counseling today.
- Kids have applications due.
- Go.
I've got to find a facility.
Somewhere he's not
already blacklisted.
I can do that.
Stacy can sub.
I can't leave him like this.
Leave him with me.
I'll stay.
I'm sorry, babe.
Why?
I love you.
- Well, you're stupid.
- Mmm.
- Because you didn't sign up for this.
- I did.
- You didn't sign up for all this.
- Yes, I did.
I signed on for exactly this
when I fell in love with you.
- Don't go sentimental.
- And everything that goes with you.
You just throw up
in your mouth a little?
Yeah, a little bit.
He's gonna be okay.
- Would you take those off?
- I can hear you.
Would you take them off, please?
"He's going
to be okay."
Yes, he will be.
Thank you.
Well, while he's restrained.
What?
Could you carry some hope
into the discussion?
He's an adult.
All you can do now
is what Nick said.
I'm not cutting off
your brother.
He's worse.
Just needs to get
the junk out of his system.
Okay.
Uh...
yeah, I don't think any of this
is gonna happen before lunch.
Talk to me around 2:30.
Good morning, Maddy.
- Artie. Thanks.
-
Lot of kids out sick today.
Thought you were another victim.
No, I got my flu shot.
- Oh. You all right?
-
Yeah, yeah.
We found Nick.
Oh, thank the good Lord.
You must be relieved.
So relieved, yeah.
- He all right?
- He's at Temple Hospital.
Travis stayed, so Stacy's
gonna take his classes.
Ah, well, Stacy can't teach
her way out of a paper bag.
- Yeah.
- You sure you want to be here?
Yeah, it's just for today.
I'm good.
-
- Guard:
- Hold on there, son.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
Glad to hear it.
Empty your pockets.
Stop running, Tobias.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
Empty your pockets, son.
Listen up, Tobias.
Do what Mr. Costa says.
Check your pockets.
Keep it.
Haven't seen you in a while.
How's things at home?
I got it.
Let's go have a chat.
- See you, Artie.
- All right.
Come on, hand it over.
You know what I'm talking about.
Right pocket.
Thank you.
Sit down.
What's going on?
Nothing.
What's the blade for?
Whittling.
Okay.
Is somebody bothering you?
Is it Dominic Fratto?
He's been okay.
I tutor him now.
Algebra I.
Remedial moron.
Okay.
So why the knife?
Hey, I could expel you
just for crossing the
threshold with that thing.
No, plea--
it's safer in numbers.
Safer from what?
Tobias, please, don't
screw yourself like this.
You've been working
your ass off.
You're on track
to go to college.
Yeah, no
one's going to college.
No one's doing anything
they think they are.
What? What are you
talking about?
Can I get my knife back, please?
No, you can't get
your knife back.
They say it's not connected.
They say that,
but I don't believe them.
It is. From reports
in five states.
They don't know if it's
a virus or a microbe.
They don't know,
but it's spreading.
- You need to--
- No, people are killing.
You need to spend
less time online, okay?
If-- if there's a problem,
we're gonna know about it.
The authorities would tell us.
Yeah.
Sure.
You're right, Miss C.
Can I go now, please?
Yeah, you can go.
Spread it out!
Bill! Bill!
Defense!
Paint-by-numbers
bullshit.
Senior project.
It's supposed to be fun.
What'll be fun is coming
back and tagging it later.
Aren't you supposed
to be in Spanish?
Am I?
- What period is it?
- Little asshole.
You know, you could
probably teach that class.
Mmm.
Want to take off?
Unlike you, I'm not smart
enough to be teaching classes.
Well, I'm not with you
because you're smart, Matt.
Have fun.
You're having a nightmare.
No shit.
You think that's what
you saw was a nightmare?
Hallucinations?
Mmm.
I really want to write
it off like that, I do,
but that's never
happened to me before.
Nothing like that.
Hey, maybe I'm losing my shit.
That psych eval
will decide that.
"How crazy is Nick?"
Scale of one to 10, huh?
Hey, can you untie me?
- No, sorry.
- Hey.
You think I'm dangerous?
- Docs are worried.
- Are you?
You ran into traffic, man.
You hurt yourself.
No, I was running from, not to.
I was running away
from what I saw.
What did you see?
Uh, just a girl.
Gloria.
You know, she's my friend
and she was--
Jesus Christ.
Okay, you
buy on the corner
and you can shoot at the church.
It's junkie communion.
And--
- The church?
- Yeah, Glo was--
yeah, so she was
with me when I scored.
Yeah, and she was with me
when I nodded.
She was there.
She was beside me.
But then--
then when I went down...
everyone was dead.
You know?
Then she came at
What did she do?
Sh--
she was eating them.
Nick...
you saw what the drugs saw.
I don't know if what I saw
came from the powder.
That's the thing.
I don't--
and if it didn't
come from the powder,
then it came out of
My mind.
And if that came out of me,
then I'm insane, Travis.
I really don't want
to be insane.
Ah, don't!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
Wait! Wait.
What happened here?
Hey!
Anyone here?!
-
-
Oh, God.
What--?
What the hell is going on?
No.
You got an hour
before the first bell.
Mm...
Okay. I need coffee
before anything.
Travis: Here's your
change of clothes.
I'll be right back.
That was sweet,
you and the step.
Not our step.
Mom likes him.
Who knows? She's used
to disappointment.
- I know what you think.
- What's that, bro?
- I know.
- What do I think?
You're perfect and I'm not.
You know, you're
going to Berkeley,
I got expelled from...
Citrus Community.
I don't compare myself.
You can't not.
Well, I don't compare
myself with crazy.
I'm not crazy.
Well, you repeat the same behavior
and expect different results.
That's Merriam-Webster
crazy.
Hey, it's not gonna
be like this anymore.
- It will.
-
- It'll be worse.
- Mm-mmm.
I'm ending it now.
I'm choosing to.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, babe?
These shoes don't go.
- I went.
- I know, I appreciate it.
No, the shooting gallery.
I found it last night.
What are you talking about?
Something really bad
happened there.
I don't care.
All right, Nick needs to know
that whatever he saw
was real or not.
Of course it wasn't.
- He was raving when they found him.
- We're late again.
Thank you.
Travis, you cannot enable him.
Well, I don't think
he's lying, though.
Oh, so you think
someone ate someone?
- There's a lot of blood.
- It's a drug den.
- It was bad.
- Bad things happen there.
Shootings and stabbings.
Why are you doing this?
I want to help him.
I know.
I know, babe.
- Right?
- Yeah.
But you can't use Nick
to repair things with Chris.
We'll help both of them.
I promise.
Okay?
I got to go.
Okay.
You need anything?
Hey, what more
could I possibly need?
Nurse says the shrink
will see you today.
Can't wait.
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, it's nothing new.
Get my head shrunk,
get out, get clean.
You mean that?
I always mean it.
Alicia: I can't believe
I did that for a week.
-
- Matt:
Alicia: Well, Berkeley's
got a good arts program.
Name me one artist
I like from Berkeley.
Exactly.
We're only a few hours away.
Same state, same time zone.
Won't have to miss me that much.
But I will. I will
miss you that much.
I just need to not be here.
Saw your brother again?
He doing better?
Better than he was
Better than he'll be two
days after he's released?
It's not on you, Alicia.
One more year.
One more year.
One more year.
Hey, meet me after school.
- I can make this better.
-
Yeah, how?
You magic?
Whoo.
Your folks still out of town?
Mm-hmm.
Meet me at the beach.
We can watch the sunset.
Go back to my place.
Get free from your family,
I get you all to myself.
We get each other.
You like it?
Mm.
Travis:
Now, what is London
trying to teach us here?
That wasn't
a rhetorical question.
You keep working on that.
That's good.
Way to go, Brandon.
To think, good.
- To listen.
- To listen. Yeah, that's good.
love the cartoons,
but this is an English class.
Put it away.
Russell!
Enlighten us.
Come on, bud.
I don't care about
building a fire.
Travis: No? Can
you build a fire?
Russell:
-
- Russell:
All right, all right.
So what about this wolf dog?
Does he care about
the man in the story?
Hell, no.
Hell, no?
Why?
That's gruesome,
but why would he do that?
To build a fire.
But why? Why would
he build a fire?
Think about it.
Think about it.
- Why would he build a fire?
- To not die.
Nailed it.
See, man versus nature.
London's trying to teach
us how not to die.
Good analysis, Russell.
Imagine what would happen if
you stayed awake in my class.
So...
Uh, so the man
Artie?
Artie.
You know how I have to evaluate
each teacher each semester?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm evaluating.
Woman: Next, divide
both sides by two...
Travis:
The dog is nature.
And nature, well,
nature always wins.
Sir, are you okay?
Making a break for it?
- Is he okay?
- Sure.
I'm here for him and for you.
Oh, no, I don't have to.
I take my dog out when I want
to, not the other way around.
- Oh, I'm the dog?
- You're the dog. Scooch.
Um, do you think you could
untie one hand, please?
Come on, it'll be easier.
Less messy.
I'll give you a moment.
Thank you.
Oh, no. Code blue! Code blue!
Room three! Room three!
- Doctor: When'd he go down?
- Nurse: Just now. 30 seconds, maybe.
Doctor: If we don't get a rhythm
in 60, I want him downstairs.
- Doctor.
- Too much we don't know.
- Doctor.
- Charge to 200.
- Clear.
- Nothing.
Doctor:
Nothing.
Okay, this gentleman needs
to be downstairs now.
Stay put.
I'll be back for you.
-
- Madison: How does he just leave?
- He's over 18.
- They didn't release him.
Shrink hadn't filed
his evaluation.
- Maddy.
- He almost died, Travis.
Wait, wait.
Excuse me.
- Where's my son?
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry. What happened?
- His roommate coded.
There was a second death on the floor.
It was chaotic.
- You need to find him.
- You need to call the police.
I'm sorry, he's gone.
Nurse.
Take me. Take me
where it started.
Travis: There's nothing
left to see there.
He might go back.
Wants to understand what he saw.
Well, I went there.
I saw.
Maddy, trust me, you
don't want to do this.
I have to see it.
Even if he's not there.
I have to see it.
Madison: This is
where he disappears.
Stay here.
I'll go in.
You think I'm waiting
in the truck?
Travis:
Hello?
There's no bodies.
They couldn't just
get up and walk away.
- Maddy.
- Something bad happened here.
You said it yourself. Things
happen here all the time.
Yeah.
It's a violent place.
It's in the genes.
Nick's got problems,
Alicia doesn't.
Well, I'm batting .500.
He's not here.
- Let's go, Maddy.
- No.
This is where he slept.
Maddy.
-
- It's Nick's.
Hey.
It's okay.
Madison.
Come away now, angel.
Come away.
Oh, God.
Home?
No, not yet.
Let's try Calvin's.
Cal.
Hey.
Miss C.
Mr. Manawa.
Cal. Good to see
you, man.
- Hey.
- Hey, Cal.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
You're looking for Nick.
Yeah, he was in an accident.
The cops picked him up.
Have you seen him?
He ran away from the hospital.
No, I haven't
seen him in a while.
You got any ideas where he'd go?
He wouldn't--
no.
He wouldn't hang
where he used to.
He moved away from us.
Yeah. Yeah.
You want to come in?
I could make some calls.
Maybe someone's heard.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.
Anything for Nicky.
- Thanks, Calvin.
- Mm-hmm.
Chris's voice: Hey, it's Chris.
Leave a message.
Hey, man. Listen, I'm
sorry to call you,
but I really, really--
like, I need to talk to you.
We're gonna find him.
He doesn't want to be found.
We'll bring him home.
Travis, he'd rather sleep in
that place than his own bed.
I don't--
I don't know if I want
him to come home.
I get it.
You do?
I don't.
- What does that make me?
-
Human.
Weak.
I'm just tired of waiting
on the call from the morgue.
Not gonna happen.
We're gonna find him,
we're gonna get him in rehab.
I will cuff our wrists together
and drag his ass.
I promise.
-
-
Better call Alicia.
Get her to eat something.
Might have been
a high-speed gone bad.
Officer on megaphone:
-
- Whoa!
Can you see anything?
No.
Officer on megaphone: Please remain
in your vehicles at all times.
-
-
Get back in the truck.
- What the hell is happening?
- Back in the truck.
I'm getting out of here.
Only five?
What, did you miss a few stops?
I hope you guys
got your flu shots.
Teacher: KTLA killed the
feed before it went ugly,
but the cameras kept rolling.
Someone leaked the footage.
What the hell is this?
Teacher:
Costa:
Guy's not dead.
Traumatized from the accident
or he is on something.
Costa:
Teacher:
There's an explanation.
No one's offered it.
Costa: This is why
everyone's staying home.
Teacher:
Costa: I've got to
call the district.
See how they want to play this.
This is what Nick
was describing.
- Call the police.
- You're sure?
We have to find him. I don't
know how else to do it.
Nick: Hey, man. Listen, I'm
sorry to keep calling you,
but I got to know what
went down at the church.
Please just call me back.
Teacher: Traditional science
deals with predictable phenomena
Girl, your parents were there?
- My mom and Travis, yeah.
-
that are impossible
to predict or control--
Ladies, am I confiscating
phones today?
It's not real.
It can't be real.
Watch, this here's the new real.
Matt's not texting me.
And you're not texting him.
Give it up, Alicia.
Costa on P.A.: Good
morning again, students.
- Do you mind?
-
- I want you on the bus.
- What's going on?
People are worried
about the shooting.
Wasn't that fake?
I want you home, okay?
What about Nick?
Well, you'll be there
if he comes back.
When he comes back.
When.
Yeah, go, baby.
Costa on P.A.: Teachers and
faculty, please report...
Thank you.
Hey.
Let's get out of here
before we get blocked in.
I'll get the truck.
Nicky, what's going on?
Hey, Cal, I'm really sorry.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry to put you
in this position and--
Sit.
Your mom's looking for you.
What do you mean?
Showed up at my folks'.
Oh.
Can't have that.
- Can't have people...
- No.
...coming to me
looking for you.
Hey, she doesn't know
what you do, Cal.
You're not talking about me?
No.
No, Cal. Cal.
Hey, man, I--
she's just really
worried about me.
Cal, I swear.
I swear, man.
I would never hurt--
I would never--
I'd never tell anyone
what you--
- You hungry?
- No, no, no, no.
- You need to get some food up in you.
-
I just-- I need
to know what you gave me.
I didn't give you anything.
Was it laced, man?
Was it PCP?
- Laced?
- Was it PCP?
Yeah, I want
my customers paranoid
and pissed off
and immune to pain.
You talking about my shit?
- No.
- Then where's your head at?
Cal, the church,
it was a bloodbath.
It was a horror show.
Gloria killed two people.
And I need to get
it out of my head.
Gloria's 90 pounds soaking wet.
- Yeah.
- Barely strong enough to spike a vein.
- I know.
- You're not making any sense, Nicky.
I know. I know.
I know, but I saw it, Cal.
I saw her do it and I need
to get it out of my head.
You need to contain yourself.
- You need to contain yourself.
- Okay, yeah.
I'm so sorry, man.
I'm leaving.
- Come on, stay.
- No, man, I'm gonna go.
Nicky, stay.
I get it.
I get it.
I get it.
You think you saw some bad shit.
I can't wipe it out.
- I can't. I can't scrub it out.
- Yeah, you can.
Yeah, you can.
Yeah, you can.
How long has it been?
Um, a couple of days.
Couple days.
Okay.
I'm managing.
- Clearly. Clearly.
- I'm really trying.
You got your works?
No.
I got you.
Oh, man.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go. Come on.
Your mom told me
you were in an accident.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I didn't look both ways.
Cops talk to you?
They had a lot of questions.
Sit tight, brother.
It's safe here.
-
- Come on.
Nicky, come on.
Hurry up, man--
oh, shit!
No, Nicky!
Nicky!
Hey, Cal.
Cal.
Hey, Cal.
Nick: No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Nick, hey, I said
not to bring her.
I told you not to bring her.
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.
- Travis, I said not to bring her.
- Are you all right?
- I know. We've both been looking for you.
- Why wouldn't I?
- Are you okay?
- I did a-- I did--
- I did a bad thing.
- It's okay.
- What are you talking about?
- It's okay, just get in the truck, Nick.
- It's not okay.
- Nicky, what happened?
- Okay, so he-- he pulled a gun on me.
- Who?
- Who did? - He pulled a gun on me
and he tried to kill me.
I wanted to know
what was in--
what was in the shit
he gave me, you know?
What are you
talking about, Nick?
Calvin.
I shot Calvin.
- Calvin?
- I shot Calvin. I killed Calvin.
Where's Calvin?
Where?
Nick! Where? What are
you talking about?
Just...
Madison:
We don't know what we're
dealing with here, Maddy.
We don't know.
I do.
Whatever happened,
it was
self-defense, okay?
Madison:
That's his car.
- Madison: Calvin.
- Where was he?
Wait.
Wait a second.
