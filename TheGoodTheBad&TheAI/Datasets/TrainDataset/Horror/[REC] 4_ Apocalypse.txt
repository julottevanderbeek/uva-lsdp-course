Neither administration officials nor experts
were ready to comment...
It was just confirmed that the military
has brought the situation under control.
All clear.
This way.
Guzm√°n, Lucas. The third floor.
Cover me.
In here.
All clear.
Second floor, charge is ready.
Let's go up.
Lucas.
Lucas! Shit!
Lucas, where the hell have you been?
- All done.
- All charges are in place.
- Let's get out of here.
- What was that?
- Shit, shit shit!
Let's get out.
Get out of here, folks.
Everybody out!
What's going on?
Are you ok? Can you breathe?
Get out of here, now!
Shit!
I'm out of ammo!
- Fire! Shoot him!
- Get away from him!
Fuck!
You're a doctor, aren't you?
You can help me.
These are the rules.
Come on. Come on. Do it!
We need to get out of here.
Help! I'm up here!
- We have to get her out.
- No way!
We're out of time.
- You go ahead, I'll deal with this.
- You're crazy.
Get me out of here, please.
Shit.
Everything's ok. Don't panic.
I'm not going to harm you.
Look at me. I'll get you out of here.
Hello, Angela.
Don't get upset.
These are to keep you from hurting yourself.
That's better.
Do you remember anything?
No.
Please hold still.
No.
Don't.
You're almost done.
Where am I?
We need to make sure that you aren't sick.
Good night.
Sorry.
Do you happen to know where the wedding is?
I suppose I had one drink too much.
My daughter-in-law must have taken me to a room.
I must have fallen asleep there.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't know where I am.
My mind must be playing tricks on me.
Well, I don't know where we are either.
- Gee, this is going to be fun.
- Have you seen anyone else?
Ok, this is what we'll do.
I'm going find out where we are. You wait here.
- Someone will come and pick you up soon.
- Good.
If you happen to run into my daughter-in-law,
tell her that I'm here.
Yes, I'll tell her.
How is she?
She is awake and quite calm and composed.
We're only wasting time. She is healthy.
There is no reason to be this cautious.
She was in there for more than six hours.
We need to be absolutely sure.
These are hurting me.
No problem, I'll loosen it a little.
Stop!
Fuck.
Attention!
Seize her, by force if need be.
- How much longer?
- Two minutes.
- She's going up.
- Stop!
Come on!
She's running to the dining room.
Stop right there!
Go! Go! Come on, run!
Run! Go!
Hold it.
- You?
- Step away.
- We got her.
- Didn't you hear me?
- Help me.
- I said, "step away."
- Come!
- Don't move!
Fuck!
Come, quickly.
Come on, quick.
Freeze! Hands in the air, don't move!
Freeze. Don't move!
- We have them and are waiting for orders.
- Where are we here?
Lower your weapons. The test says they're clean.
- Who are you?
- Take her to her cabin.
- You should rest.
- No.
Don't worry, we won't restrain you anymore.
I give you my word.
I demand to know who you are.
I really regret this incident.
- I'm Dr. Ricarte.
- I want to speak my superiors.
They sent you here.
And my partner?
I assume you're talking about Private Lucas.
We had to examine him. Just a routine procedure.
He'll be with you soon.
Why are we here?
This wasn't part of the operation.
We can ensure complete isolation here.
What for? We're fine. You've examined me.
The situation is a little more complicated than that.
There was another case in Barcelona.
We were able to get it under control,
but another mistake would be disastrous.
Let me guess: a wedding.
There was only a single survivor.
I see you've already met her.
Hey, new passengers?
That's just great.
Please excuse me.
I'm sure our Captain Ortega will be happy
to show you his ship.
Captain.
You must have come on board with the last group.
I guess so. I'm Guzm√°n.
I'll show you around.
- So, you're in charge here?
- The people who pay me are in charge.
And these doctors have paid me enough I can retire.
After this I'll return home. It's about time to retire.
So, the doctors call the shots?
Yes, and they've brought their own army along for the ride.
I think you've already made their acquaintance.
What's the status?
We'll soon head into a low pressure system.
Alright. Minimum speed ahead. With luck, it'll pass by us.
Of course. It’s not like we’re in a hurry or anything.
Gorostiaga is the ship's officer. From Bilbao. Great guy.
Pilot, that's shorter. Call me Goro.
That graze doesn't look good.
This? Tell it to those brave soldiers.
It's their handiwork.
Have you dressed it with something?
You should disinfect it.
Listen to him, he's a doctor.
An expert for infections and such.
Not again.
This tub is too old for jaunts like this.
Nah, she's not too old.
The generator is overloading
because of all the medical equipment.
What do you mean?
We've been having brownouts ever since we left port.
At night, we even get complete blackouts.
They're building some kind of laboratory down there.
- What medical equipment?
- It's really none of our business.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to disturb you, but...
Do I know you?
I get really confused with so many people here.
Are you related to my grandson or to the bride?
You probably had too much to drink?
Don't worry, dear, me too.
Nick. Nick!
What are you doing there?
Nothing.
It may not seem that way, but Nick is our radio operator.
Well, it's not like there's a whole lot for me to do.
They've encrypted the frequencies,
and they're the only ones who have the codes.
- We have no contact with the outside?
- They won't even allow us lifeboats.
I suppose nobody told you that.
Even the drainage system has been closed off.
They insisted on that.
What did they call it again? “Security Protocols”.
- Can you believe it?
- How are you coming along with the camera?
I'm working on it, but it takes time.
The camera still works,
but the hard drive is on the fritz.
I have to recover each sector individually.
It's a tedious process.
Nick doubles as our IT technician or whatever you call it.
The doctors want him to restore the video files.
They're very keen on watching it.
It was me who found the camera, next to the reporter.
Get out! You're the one who saved √Ångela Vidal?
Something like that.
- You can't imagine how happy this makes him.
- I'm a huge fan of her!
I never miss any of her reportages.
And now she's visiting you in person.
So it would seem.
Seeing that you rescued her, you probably know her well.
Well, at least a little. Enough to introduce me to her.
Of course.
Great!
What do you think of our Filipino DJ?
I guess he had no better tune.
That's the dinner bell.
You get used to it eventually.
Hello, the deep sea speaking. What's up?
- It's worse than I thought.
You need to have a little patience up there.
Here you go.
There's nothing else on the menu.
You know...
I don't eat much in the evening.
A glass of warm milk is all I need.
I see.
Could I maybe get a glass of milk for the Lady?
- Milk?
- And a few cookies, if it's not too much to ask.
And maybe you've got a little meat, or at least gravy.
Hey. That bracelet doesn't mean
that you're on a cruise ship.
Take it easy.
Where have you been?
- I could ask you the same.
- True.
- Have you heard anything from my family?
- No.
I understand that the wedding has to be modern,
but this here is too much of a good thing.
- Milk and cookies.
- Great.
Thanks, that's very sweet.
They have sugar over there.
Oh? Well, a little bit won't hurt me.
She is very confused and has no idea where she is.
- Someone should talk to her.
- Really?
What should we tell her? That her family is dead?
I just met with the captain.
They had to cut the lifeboats,
and all radio traffic is stopped.
- What?
- That's right.
They've set up a laboratory.
Wasn't there a mention of preventive quarantine?
But a laboratory?
They're keeping something from us.
Why are all these soldiers here?
Have you seen all the cameras?
They're everywhere.
You can't even take a leak without being filmed.
It drives me crazy.
Well, maybe we're over-reacting.
Looks like you've done it. Good job.
You know, you could work for Naval Intelligence. I...
- Seriously?
- Well, you never know.
Naval Intelligence. Wow.
Say, do you know a way to access their
surveillance cameras from here?
- Who do you think I am?
- I've seen you watch a feed earlier.
That was the first thing I did.
I was just trying to pass the time.
How do you think I found out about her?
It's crazy.
- You're still going to introduce me to her, right?
- Of course.
And the lab?
The door opens with a numerical code.
They don't want any visitors.
They think themselves safe,
but they haven’t faced me yet.
There it is.
- What are they up to in there?
- Nothing good, I suppose.
I've seen them bringing cages aboard.
What use would they possibly be?
Freaking cages.
And what's behind that door?
No idea. There are no cameras.
I can't get any closer than this.
No, not bad at all.
Does this work with all cameras?
Which one would you like to see?
Please, not now.
It's happening again.
Come on.
Hey!
What is it?
I have no idea what you're doing down here.
This should have been fixed long ago.
Oh really? Well, if you say so.
He's fucking with us.
I guess where you come from,
you negros like to take things slow.
But things work a little different around here.
Now get the fuck to work already!
I come from M√≥stoles .
And on this ship, things work the way I say they work.
You heard me. Hurry up.
Do not worry, it's me.
What are you doing here?
I was scared.
It's ok. I'm with you now, ok?
- Let's go to our cabins.
- Wait.
Please don't tell them about this.
Look, nobody here wants to harm you. Nobody.
Come on.
This looks like wind force eight . Wanna bet?
It's coming right at us.
- Looks that way.
- Shit.
It's dropping sooner than we thought.
What did you think?
This is my last trip.
I don't mind if it gets a little rough one last time.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Sorry to interrupt. Good Morning.
Good Morning.
This is √Ångela.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I've heard a lot about you.
- That over there is...
- Goro.
- And over here is your number one fan.
- You can say that again.
Well, I sometimes watch your reportages.
- I'm Nick. Hello.
- Hello.
- He is recovering the video from your camera.
- Well, I’m doing my best.
My camera?
It's here?
Say, do you ever watch your own broadcasts on TV?
Of course not, silly question.
I remember the reportage with the garbage men.
You jumped into the container,
and the guy looked like he didn't believe his eyes.
That was great.
- You want one?
- No.
- Excuse me, would you perhaps...
- What?
Record something for my voicemail, something
like "Hi, I'm √Ångela Vidal..."?
That would really be great.
It doesn't have to be right now of course.
I guess people pester you with such requests
all the time.
Oh crap.
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, that was my fault.
It's waterproof.
At least that's how they sold it to me.
In case that we sink.
- Have you already watched it?
- A few parts.
I can't imagine what was going on there,
but I'm glad that I wasn't there.
OPERATION COMPLETE
There it is now. Very good.
This part is done.
Now I just need to sort through it.
That'll take a while.
- How long do you think?
- About an hour.
Maybe less.
Are you sure you don't want one?
They're delicious.
Let's go.
He's gone. The host is gone.
What the hell are you saying?
- Sound the alarm!
- No!
We need to maintain control.
Lock it down.
The straps are intact.
- Someone has set him free.
- Impossible.
A security guard would have noticed something.
- It was during the power outage.
- And what about the door code?
- How many people know it?
- Very few.
- Nobody would do something so senseless.
- Everyone, come with me.
Bring the tazer and the serum.
- What is your plan?
- Find him before he attacks somebody.
Let's hope this works.
Fuck.
- What's up with the food?
- What do you mean?
The Filipino's asleep.
We've been waiting for ten minutes.
This useless idiot.
Edwin?
Holy shit, what happened here?
Well, hello there.
At least you've put in some effort today.
Hello? Are you daydreaming over there?
The men are hungry.
Their tempers are getting worse by the minute.
Get cracking, do you hear me?
I'll take that with me.
Hurry up now, or else there'll be trouble.
OPERATION COMPLETE
Yes. Wonderful.
All done.
SEND FILE
It's lamb today. What a great surprise.
- I hope there's still something left.
- Of course.
The second shift begins in 20 minutes.
Hurry up.
And how are you today?
They probably think I wouldn't notice
that they've put me in a nursing home,
without even telling me.
Do you have a little appetite today?
No, it's not my appetite that's amiss.
My stomach is acting up.
Could you perhaps talk to the steward?
Maybe he can make me some noodles or croquettes.
I can go ask him. But I can't promise anything.
Hello?
Hello?
Sorry.
Do you maybe have something else?
The old lady has a sensitive stomach
and would like some pasta or...
Fuck.
Here, just try a little bit.
It smells good enough.
I guess I'll have a little taste.
No! Stop! Don't eat that!
- What's going on?
- The chef tried to bite me.
- What?
- And, did he?
No. No.
- Has anyone eaten anything?
- No.
Ok, you stay here.
- Wait.
- Stay here.
Hold it.
- What happened?
- I thought it was just about the quarantine.
Tell me what happened.
- The chef tried to bite me.
- Do you know what that means?
- Where is he?
- In the kitchen.
I've locked him into the cold storage room.
Alright. Come with me.
Only you.
It won't be long now.
This will be the zenith of my career.
Is everything ok with you?
I'm not feeling so great.
Something must have upset my stomach.
That doesn't surprise me.
It's this worm in raw fish.
- Anisakis?
- What?
- The worm is called Anisakis.
- Whatever.
But there was no fish for dinner.
You best go and lie down a bit.
I'll hold the fort.
A serum. That's what we've been working on.
We were able to stop two outbreaks,
but the next time we might be less fortunate.
I thought nothing was known about the virus.
We know more than you think.
We got a sample.
We used it to inject a host.
We were waiting for the symptoms to manifest and...
- Wait a minute. Where did you get the sample?
- That doesn't matter.
Someone has released the host,
and this presents us with a problem.
- How fucking wonderful.
- Give him the Tazer.
We don't have much time.
- What are you trying to do?
- We need to test the serum.
As soon as the door opens, pull the trigger.
The electric shock will paralyse him.
- You have to act fast.
- Ok.
Ready?
- Go.
- Now!
Out of the way!
Get out of here!
Damn.
What the hell happened?
There was a feedback mechanism.
Damn, that can't be.
It obviously can.
It should have worked.
You've lost control.
Now, will you kindly call in for help?
- He's right. They need to get us out.
- You know the rules.
Nobody is going to get us out of here.
Not anymore.
We need to go to the lab and continue our work.
Wait a minute, what about us?
We do not know whether the food is infected.
- None of us has eaten anything.
- Yes, I warned them just in time.
- Then there is no need to worry.
- I beg your pardon? We were the second group.
- You can't just leave us here.
- We cannot take any chances.
- Well then.
- Now wait a moment.
I've given you what you wanted.
Don't do this to us.
What is he talking about?
I'm sorry.
Come on, we don't have time for this.
Lucas?
What did you do?
They wanted me to bring a blood sample from the building.
Infected blood?
- It was only a little. They thought...
- For whom?
It's not just a virus.
Some priests have shown me horrible photos.
- You have no idea.
- What else?
I was told they'd finance everything.
You motherfucker! Bastard!
And now what?
Now, now...
This is no way to treat one another.
You have no idea what's going on here.
Maybe somebody should tell you
that your entire fucking family is dead!
- Dead!
- Leave her alone!
Enough!
Whatever this is,
if the food was infected,
we need to prepare ourselves for the worst.
Let's go to the bridge.
Ortega can help us.
And how do we do that?
We don't even have any weapons.
Take anything that could be useful.
And hurry up.
- Here.
- This is useless.
It's all we have. Let's go.
Come on.
Hurry up already!
Please don't take this as an insult,
but I'd really like to lie down for a while now.
Back, back.
Back...
Back, back, back. Back!
Fuck!
Get away from it!
We have to get out of here!
Come on, we need to make it to the bridge.
Come on, let's go.
They're all over the ship. Where is Goro?
He didn't feel well. He went to lie down.
Shit.
- Everything quiet down there?
Then keep it up until you hear from me again.
- Just do what I tell you.
Lock the door.
This way. Come.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, let's go.
Please call my children to come and pick me up.
We're almost there.
- I promise, I won't be a bother to them.
- Come on.
What is it now?
Don't you have anything better to do?
What is this?
Get out of here!
Help me!
- I can't.
- Shoot already!
- I can't!
- Help me!
What the hell is that?
Let go of him!
What is this?
The oil pressure is dropping.
Just what we fucking needed.
Get away from there!
Fuck! What was that?
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Where is she?
- She's run off.
- I'm about to go nuts!
- What do we do now?
- You go to the bridge. I'll go look for her.
Hey, where are you going?
You don't have a weapon. That's suicide.
We can't just let her down.
I've messed up.
And I need to make up for that.
Let's go.
It's us. Open up!
- Don't.
- But it’s...
- Open the door!
- They might be infected.
- Nick!
- Goro! Goro!
Quick, get in here.
Close the door!
What's going on out there?
Are the doctors after you?
You're in charge as of now.
We're going home.
I'd love to, but the engine is losing oil.
It could catch fire. I need to turn it off.
- No! No!
- Keep it together, man! Calm down!
Wait. We could turn on the auxiliary motor.
- Then do it.
- This is only possible from the engine room.
Fucking shit!
What is really going on here?
Weren't you in that building?
I have no idea.
But these doctors know something.
And we need to find out what it is.
Sure. And how do we do that?
Are you simply going to ask them?
Can't you hack into their computers?
They've given me network access so I can send them the video.
Shit, they've got an internal encryption.
- What is that?
- Nothing major.
- I'm at a loss.
- It's all right.
This should have worked.
Maybe the virus has mutated with the DNA of the host.
- If that were the case, every sample would be different.
- Damn it.
We need the original strain that hasn't mutated.
The girl.
But we don't have her.
Gentlemen,
it's over.
No, wait.
- There must be a way.
- I'm sorry.
You know the protocol.
- No.
- 20 minutes. Enjoy them.
Wait. We could try an enzyme inhibitor.
Maybe we can achieve a higher strength of the membrane.
This would only delay the process.
It won't do us any good.
Not without the original strain.
I'm sorry.
I'm begging you.
You can't do that.
We were not allowed to fail.
- You know the rules.
- No.
Wait. He's done it.
We have the video.
Here, see for yourself.
- Which are the oldest folders?
- One moment.
Here.
What this supposed to be?
- My goodness.
- Wait, wait.
I know this name.
From the building.
I saw it on some newspaper clippings.
This is the same girl.
There were photos of her all over the walls.
These are medical treatment records.
The Diocese of Naples had her admitted.
- The Church?
- "Diagnostic test results." What's this?
Wait a minute.
The newspaper said that she was possessed.
There was something about the Church, and a demon.
Cut the bullshit.
It all makes sense.
They wanted a medical diagnosis.
And who admitted her?
Well, will you look at this.
What's that?
- Impossible.
- It is the girl.
- What was she doing there?
- Rewind it.
What is happening there?
Oh god.
It's a parasite.
The source of the virus.
It was right under our noses.
So this is the demon. A parasite.
This thing has used the girl as a host.
But in order to protect itself, it has immunised her.
All these years, it has been growing inside her body.
Until it found a more suitable host.
We have the original strain.
Prepare everything for the procedure.
We need to get this thing out of her.
It's not too late.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, we need to go join the others.
Come with me.
No, no, no.
Ha! Fuckers!.
Don't move.
Drop your weapon and turn around.
Where is the reporter?
On a cruise.
For the last time.
Where is she?
- What's going on? Did he not answer?
- No.
And he's not going to either.
Then we'll go down ourselves and turn on the engine.
Sure. Easy as pie. But I won't go out there.
Would you rather wait for these creatures to come here?
This is my last trip.
If anyone wants to go home, it's me.
But I want to get there alive.
Open up!
- Lucas!
- Open up.
What is this?
Nobody touch her. Step away from her.
- What's going on here?
- It's a parasite. It's inside of her.
- This parasite is the origin of the virus.
- I beg your pardon?
- What did you say?
- The video shows it clearly.
You can watch it if you like.
What nonsense are you talking now?
- She is clean.
- She is indeed.
This thing immunises its host, so it can go undetected.
- Easy now, we need her alive.
- Let go of her!
- You're making a mistake.
- I said, let go of her.
- Your gun isn't loaded.
- But this one is.
You don't seem to understand.
The parasite is the original strain.
We can't get the serum without it.
It's the only way.
- I don't give a damn.
- Please, be reasonable.
We'll take it out of her without doing her any harm.
No, don't believe a single word.
You're a doctor.
You know only too well that this is our only chance.
No.
No.
No!
- It's too far to the laboratory.
- We'll use the table.
- Quick.
- No!
- Hurry up.
- Nick! Nick!
Careful.
No, don't. No! No!
- On her back.
- Help!
Hold on tight.
Restrain her. Very good.
Wait. What if you're wrong?
Like I said, you can watch the video yourself.
- Time is running out.
- Nick.
Release her.
- I can't find it.
- It must be there.
Here, doctor.
Hold her head. Focus.
There.
- I need towels.
- In the bathroom.
Come on, quickly!
Quick. Here, hold her tight.
What is going on here?
No. No!
- Help me, goddamnit!
- I'm out of ammo.
Shoot already! Shoot!
- What is it?
- No idea.
Grab her! Do it!
Fire!
Shoot already!
Hold her! She must not escape.
It's just a scratch. It's nothing.
No.
Wait.
The strain works. You said it yourself.
We can synthesise the serum now.
There is no time. You know that.
You still need me.
No.
- Now what?
- Now we're looking for the reporter.
No, the game is over.
You're going to call for help now.
You're the only one who can operate the radio.
- Not without the serum.
- You'll never get it.
If we don't get it,
We won't be returning anywhere.
Come on, we're out of time.
Set your radio frequency to nine.
She can't be far.
Shit.
That's it. I've had it.
Can you steer the ship?
I can try. I've helped a few times.
We'll go down. Do you know how to
turn on the auxiliary engine?
I think so. But I'm not going down there.
With four knives we won't get far.
- Cut the crap.
- Do you have a better idea?
Wait. In the chest at the fore-deck
is fishing equipment.
Oh great, now we go fishing.
You stay here. We'll go have a look.
When we get back, we're off to the engine room.
Close up behind us.
You're the only one who can steer the ship.
That's the fore-deck.
This is a fucking maze.
There. There she is.
I have her. She's at the cabins.
- Where?
Quick, get moving!
Shit, she's destroying the cameras!
Where is she?
Goddamn fucking shit!
I see her. She's going to the dining room.
Go.Go!
She's in the corridor to the dining room.
Hurry!
It's me, Nick. Pick up the radio.
Press the seven. Come on, do it.
- Nick?
- Now we can talk. I see you.
I can't do anything.
- Ok.
They're almost there.
What are you doing?
They'll be there any moment.
You need to get away immediately.
Go on.
Why are you doing this?
- You go inside.
- Alright.
- Go, go, go!
- Here, take this.
- What are you doing, Lucas?
- Wait!
Come on, come on!
Let's get this party started.
Where is she?
How could she have escaped us?
- We already had her.
- Be careful.
Where the hell is she hiding?
Help!
Help me!
Do something! The fire extinguisher!
Take the fire extinguisher! Come on!
Quick!
Help!
- I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Hit him over the head!
You are wrong.
I know what you want from me,
but you're wrong.
You can check it now.
Go back to your fucking laboratory and check it.
And then leave me alone.
I'm sorry.
- And now? We have no more weapons.
- You can leave.
Wait.
What's that on your hand?
You've been bitten.
No! Don't!
BEGIN ANALYSIS
DATA PROCESSING IN PROGRESS
Nick? Nick, are you there?
Trust me. I need the code to the lab.
What?
I need to prove to them that they're wrong.
Please.
Trust me, Nick.
I beg you.
Alright. I'll give it to you.
Guzm√°n has taught me how to
film it with the security camera.
This can't be.
It can't be.
- But it is so.
- But I've seen it myself.
- I don't care.
- Harpoons.
- Right, harpoons.
And nothing else?
- I see.
- Alright.
We go down there, and you turn on the engine.
Then it's time to go home.
Wait. √Ångela is clean.
Ricarte has checked it.
I've seen it through the cameras.
She's in the laboratory.
We need to go get her.
Alright, I'll go.
You two go to the engine room.
We meet here.
- Say it.
- It's impossible.
- There must be a mistake.
- There is no mistake!
You are to stay away from me, or I'll kill you!
Tell them! Now!
Say what?
The parasite leaves the host
when it finds a more suitable one.
Hidden inside her, it was able to make it out of the building.
The video proves it. We've seen it.
I don't care. Your analysis says otherwise.
If she were the host, you'd be infected.
- She bit you.
- I'm well aware of that.
But there must be an explanation.
You're playing us for fools.
Is that true, √Ångela? Are you deceiving us?
What about you? Perhaps you're the one deceiving us?
Why did you want the code to the lab?
You asked Nick for it. Why?
I wanted to know what was in there.
When I met you, you came straight from the lab, right?
You released the monkey.
Oh, really? And why would I have done that?
You saved me from the building.
We were alone for almost a minute.
If this thing was inside of me ...
It leaves its host when it finds a better one.
- Isn't that right?
- Right.
The old host is then discarded.
You are very brave, √Ångela. I admire that.
- It's over.
- Die!
Where do you think you're going, √Ångela?
Careful, don't hurt yourself with that.
Now the party's really starting.
No!
Stop.
Go back!
Finish him!
Let's go, Nick. Go!
Go, go.
This way.
- Here?
- Yes.
- Quick.
- Shit.
What is it?
- Nick, what's wrong?
- It won't work.
Why not? You said you could do it.
- I said I could try.
- Now, come on!
- Quick, hurry!
- Yes.
Come on! Fuck.
Damn!
Shit.
Gimme that.
- Go, Nick!
- Shit!
Turn it on!
Help me, Nick!
Go, Nick!
- No, no. Please don't.
- Nick!
Evacuate immediately.
Evacuate immediately.
Evacuate immediately.
No, don't. I'm healthy. I'm clean.
- Where is Angela?
- I don’t know. Let's get out of here.
The ship is going to explode.
Look, over here.
That's an inflatable lifeboat.
- We can use the engine.
- Where is Angela?
Forget her. It's too late.
You must think of yourself.
Us two can make it off this ship.
Really.
Kiss my ass.
Great, Nick.
Evacuate immediately.
Fuck.
Angela!
Monkeys!
Shit.
We have to go. This thing is going to blow.
Oh shit!
- No!
- Come on, to the dining room.
They're gone.
- Do you hear anything?
- No.
Evacuate immediately.
We need to get on deck. The time is almost up.
And the engine? Where is the engine?
- It got wedged in. It's in the corridor.
- Damn!
Nevermind.
We hurry out, grab it and run, ok?
Alright.
One, two, three.
Did you think you could escape me?
After all we've been through together?
No, don't!
No!
No, √Ångela. I'll come with you.
I still have a lot to do.
Let's get out of here, hurry!
Go, run! Go!
Go, go!
Let's go, hurry!
Run!
Run!
Give me the engine. Give it to me!
- We have to jump.
- No!
Then they'll kill us. Jump already!
No!
I can't!
Jump!
Nick!
Jump, Angela!
Nick!
Let go, Angela. Come on!
You have to let go!
Angela!
Angela!
Angela!
- Nick!
- Here! Take my hand!
Take my hand!
Take my hand, √Ångela.
Go.
Will you start already!
- Shit, it won't start.
- Come on, we need to get out of here!
I'm dropping off two passengers
in the center, then I'm headed there.
Guess that was some pretty wild party, huh?
