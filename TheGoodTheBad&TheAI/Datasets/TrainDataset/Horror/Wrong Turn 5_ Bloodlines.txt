I love you, Billy.
Oh, my God.
Damn it, Billy. I think you broke my jaw.
You fucking deserve it, you assholes!
- Oh, are you okay, baby?
- No.
Get the fuck out of here!
What the hell are you doing
dressed like that?
For the Mountain Man Festival,
thought we'd dress up.
Yeah, where are your costumes?
- What?
- We don't have any.
You can't go without a costume.
It shows lack of commitment.
Can we have this conversation
after I can get dressed?
Okay. Okay.
Nice, Billy.
Nice. Assholes.
This is Kaleen Webber,
reporting from the small town of Fairlake...
...which, once a year,
turns into a big town on Halloween...
...due to the 10th annual
Mountain Man Music Festival.
People from all over the country
descend upon Fairlake...
...for a weekend of music, partying and fun
at the fairgrounds just outside town.
The festival has grown over the years
to where it now rivals...
...Coachella and Lollapalooza.
But some say that its free spirit and rowdy
crowds reminds them of Burning Man...
...which has local officials concerned
on this night.
Now back to you at the studio.
- Great.
- Here's the deal.
I'm going for a run
to get my head out of this small-town crap.
I'll meet you here for the live feed at 11.
And everything better be ready to go.
Go away, kid.
Hurry up. We gotta get on the road.
I don't wanna be late.
All right,
give me a minute to get up first.
We heard you're the one-minute man.
No. I assure you he has no problems
in that department.
All right. I'm starving.
I gotta make breakfast first.
- Come on, Billy.
- Well, you gotta start your day out right.
Nice costume, creep.
You know what? I'm sick of this.
I'm sick of you kids partying,
making a mess and trying to scare people.
Well, you know what?
You don't scare me.
So fuck you. Go home.
Help me! Help me, please!
Somebody help me!
Hey, hey. Over here.
Oh, please help. They're chasing me.
Follow me. This way.
Down here.
Okay.
Okay, I think they've gone.
Thank you.
You saved me from those maniacs.
Hey, you're bleeding pretty badly there.
Let me fix that for you.
Thank God for you.
Yeah. Thank God for me.
Now, you keep pressure on that.
- You stay here.
- Okay.
I'm gonna make sure they've gone.
- Okay, it's all clear. This way.
- Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
But there's....
- There's just one thing I forgot.
- What?
This.
Hey, give me a hand, will you?
No, you fucking idiot.
The body.
Jesus fucking Christ.
- Wake and bake, brother.
- Thanks.
You're such a slob.
Can you try
and be a little bit cleaner for me?
- What?
- You look like a pig.
All right. Check it out.
I got all our party favors arranged
by date and time.
So this is cutting into my overhead.
But in honor of this weekend and Julian's
great idea for us to come out here...
...I've made an exception.
First up, some chronic,
which you're participating in.
And then some x
for when we go trick or treating...
...and some shrooms
for when the bands start playing.
You've been out of school
for two semesters.
- What do your parents think?
- Oh, no. They don't know shit.
And I wanna keep it that way.
Besides, you know,
I'm a budding entrepreneur.
Why did we have to come
all the way out here?
Because it's Mountain Man, baby.
Hey, come on, look,
we could have gone to Burning Man.
But I'm not gonna drive
all the way across country.
We got a homegrown version of it here.
Yeah. Mountain Man has got a much more
interesting story to it, anyway.
- You know the story, Cruz?
- I'm not from around here, remember?
Okay, well, we're going
to a small town called Fairlake.
It was founded in 1814
or some shit like that.
Well, apparently, the local miners didn't get
along too well with the hill people.
I guess it was a territory dispute.
There was conflicts
over the next couple of years.
Now, Halloween night, 1817...
...the entire town
was ravaged by hillbillies...
...in the largest massacre
in the state's history.
The only problem
was no bodies were found.
It was just-- Just blood. Lots of it.
It was-- You know, it--
The entire town,
every inhabitant disappeared.
Was never seen again.
- That's awful.
- Well....
Legend has it, the hillbillies hauled
all the bodies up to the woods...
...created a huge bonfire and then
they cooked the fair residents of Fairlake.
Well-- And then they ate them.
- Okay, you know what? I don't wanna go.
- Oh, come on, baby, we're almost there.
No. I don't wanna celebrate a massacre.
- It's innocent fun.
- It's wrong.
We'll just go tonight, we'll leave tomorrow,
okay? Come on, Cruz.
Just one night, huh?
Please?
Okay, fine.
It is fine.
What the fuck is all this shit?
What have I told you about this?
I told you a thousand fucking times...
...you never leave anything behind.
You never ever leave anything behind!
What if somebody found this, huh?
Then you got cops investigating,
snooping around.
You don't live in some goddamn hospital
in the middle of nowhere anymore.
You live closer to civilization,
a lot fucking closer!
I have been doing this for 30 years...
...and I have never had to move.
Do you know why?
Because I never leave shit behind!
I swear to fucking God,
you three pinheads...
...you'd all be under lock and key by now
if I hadn't of happened across you.
You live in my fucking house now
and you play by my fucking rules.
You do as I say...
...or I swear to God,
I will take you all down, kin or no kin.
Get her processed.
- Looking forward to the trip?
- Yeah.
Thinking about getting me
a new .30-06 for the occasion.
It was lucky of Jason
to win the bear license lottery.
I know. He's very excited.
- Well, he's a good guy to invite me along.
- I know. That's why I married him.
- You sure you don't wanna come?
- I've got ajob to do.
You need to learn to relax a bit.
You're always so by-the-book.
You ride us like we're in the military.
Discipline, Junior,
it's a good tool to use in life.
Ready for tonight?
Mob of kids, such a pain in the keister.
It should be a big night
for drunk and disorderly.
Sheriff Carter.
Who is the sexiest sheriff
in all of Greenbrier County?
I'm the only sheriff in Greenbrier County.
Still doesn't mean you're not sexy.
Hey, I just blew off the second shift.
I'm headed home.
That's good.
Junior's buying a new rifle
for your hunt this weekend.
Tell him it won't make him a better shot.
Yeah, I aIready did.
L'm gonna fix some lasagna tonight
for dinner.
- I'll stop by and bring you some?
- That would be great.
But call first. It's gonna be a busy night.
L may head down to the fairgrounds.
Then I'll bring it to you there.
I'll call you Iater. Bye, honey.
Okay, bye, honey.
Gotta turn this up.
There's supposed to be
about 20 bands there.
- Oh, who's playing?
- The Cheetah Whores.
Oh, who are they?
- An all-girI band. Freaking awesome.
- Yeah.
Gus' favorite band.
If they're so awesome,
why haven't I heard of them?
You're from the West Coast.
They don't play there.
- When are you gonna go back, by the way?
- June.
But just for a month to see my parents.
- Billy is coming with me.
- Yeah.
- Nice.
- We are gonna have an epic time.
Meeting the foIks?
That's getting pretty serious.
Who? Me? Serious? Never.
Look out!
Is everyone okay?
Is anybody hurt?
- I'm all right.
- No, we're okay.
Oh, shit.
Where did he come from?
Did we hit him?
I'm not sure.
Well, we should see if he's dead.
You guys, stay here.
Goddamn it.
I didn't see him in the rain.
- Yeah, I think he's dead.
- But I didn't hit him.
You must have.
Hey.
Fuck you.
You trying to fuck with us?
- Get up.
- You piece of shit.
- Freeze.
- Put your hands on your head.
- He stabbed me.
- Put your hands on your head now!
Don't you move.
- Turn around and walk towards me.
- Shit.
Slowly.
Go!
I want everyone to wait together
by your vehicIe. Biggs?
I've got them, sheriff.
Don't you move.
Face down on the ground.
Right hand behind your back.
Left hand.
Turn around.
I need a wagon.
Route 96, mile marker 30.
- Copy that. On its way.
- Great, thanks.
Hey, sheriff.
It Iooks like we've got
an entire pharmacy here.
And the festivaI hasn't even started yet.
It's gonna be a long night.
Junior, can you stay with the car
until the tow truck arrives?
UntiI we get a search?
I don't wanna mess up evidence.
Sure thing, boss.
What the fuck?
Hey.
Hold it right there.
Shit!
Hey.
That should do it.
You need to have those stitches
removed in about three weeks.
Thank you.
All done here, sheriff.
- Thanks for coming, Rick.
- That's all right.
I know how busy it's gonna get
for you tonight.
- Goodbye.
- Good night.
You know, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.
If I get charged, they're gonna take
my schoIarship away from me.
- We can get kicked out of schooI.
- Billy, you gotta tell her.
- It was your drugs, not ours.
- No, no. If he cIaims it's all his...
- ...they couId throw the book at him.
- I don't care.
I'm sitting in jaiI because of him.
- I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
- All right, hey, don't worry, all right?
I got this.
Sheriff, can I speak with you a moment?
What is it?
The drugs are mine.
My friends had nothing to do with it.
That's to be determined.
HonestIy, they're mine. They'll tell you.
He's right.
PIease let them go.
I'll take responsibiIity.
All right. I'm gonna need space tonight,
anyway.
Don't leave town.
We won't go anywhere.
There's a moteI at the end of the street.
- Thanks.
- You can get your things.
We'll bring you back some dinner, Billy.
Thanks.
Hey, what about me?
You saw how they attacked me.
Why am I being heId?
AssauIt with a deadIy weapon.
- That's bullshit.
- The cut on the boy's arm says otherwise.
Well, would you at Ieast move me
to another cell?
This drunk stinks.
You'll survive.
- Where is she?
- I've been calling her cell for the Iast hour.
- She's not picking up.
- Freaking diva.
I hate taIent.
You're gonna have to fill in.
What?
No, I can't.
You can and you will.
No one goes to dead air on my watch.
Okay.
Here we are on Main Street
in the town of FairIake, West Virginia.
The kids are out for Halloween
in full force...
...but they're joined
by a bunch of hillbillies...
...for the 10th annuaI
Mountain Man Music FestivaI.
So whether you're dressed as a ghost
or a witch or a hillbilly...
...everyone is sure
to have a happy Halloween...
...with some great music to top it all off.
That's all for now.
I'm Virginia Kelly from Live Action News.
Good job.
- Is this it?
- Oh, 3, this is it.
It Iooks all right.
- Nice.
- This is our bed, Gus.
Seems like you've been running
for quite some time.
Well, your running just ended.
There is no statute of Iimitations
for murder.
You have no idea
what you've gotten yourself into, do you?
A Iot of paperwork, I suspect.
U.S. Marshals'office.
Yeah, this is Sheriff Carter in FairIake.
I have a fugitive for you.
He's been on the run for 30 years.
- What's his name?
- Maynard Odets.
Case number 316165.
We can have transport there by 10 a.m.
Yeah, that will be fine.
The marshaIs will be here
to pick you up in the morning.
You won't Iive that long.
I highIy doubt that.
No, I-- No, I know. I know.
No, it's--
Yeah, but it was a complete accident.
It was an a-- Yeah.
Tomorrow.
The car is totaIed.
No, I sent the other deputies
to the fairgrounds to poIice the festivaI.
All except Junior.
Which reminds me,
he should be back by now.
Jason?
Jason?
Mr. Brodin?
Mr. Brodin.... Lost the signaI.
ProbabIy for the best.
To say Billy's dad is pissed
is the understatement of the year.
- Is he coming tomorrow?
- Yeah.
How much troubIe
do you think Billy's in?
Oh, God, there's a Iot of drugs
in that bag.
I don't think he's gonna get off
with a misdemeanor.
Do you think Billy's gonna go to jaiI?
Billy's dad will throw the best Iawyers at it
because Billy's dad is Ioaded.
- He might not have to. He might get Iucky.
- Yeah. I wouldn't worry about it.
Billy's dad's connected up to the wazoo.
Okay, so let's go to the festivaI.
What the hell, Julian? We can't go now.
Well, we can't help Billy
sitting in a hotel room. Why not? We--
Come on, we came all this way.
- And how do you propose we get there?
- Walk.
Well, I'm not going anywhere, guys.
Here, babe.
Damn drunk kids.
Hey!
What the hell's going on here?
Will you shut up?
It's started.
They're coming for me and you're dead.
But you don't know it yet.
Who's coming for you?
My boys.
They're gonna cut your Iiver out
and eat it in front of you.
I don't wanna be in here with this guy.
Can you please put me in the other cell?
You're all dead.
You hear me, kid?
Fuck you, old man.
You can go home, Mose.
- Where are your deputies?
- Covering the festivaI.
- Maybe I should stick around?
- What for?
You got nobody with you, just in case.
It's fine, Mose. He's just a crazy old man.
Just in case.
If you don't mind, that is.
Okay, but make yourself useful.
Go through the drawers
for the fIashIights.
Light ain't gonna save you.
If you don't shut up, I'm gonna charge you
with threatening an officer.
Hey, charge away, officer.
Shit.
Oh, my God.
- Is he here?
- Oh, my God, no.
Hi, officer.
I think I took a wrong turn.
Can you tell me how to get backstage?
Another wrong turn, huh?
I can show you,
but you need a pass to get in.
I will do anything to get a pass.
Shit.
Deputy Biggs, come in.
Junior, it's Angela, come in.
Mike, Kevin, you guys out there?
Looks like you're all alone,
you dumb bitch.
Four tickets at 90 bucks a pop,
that's 260 bucks.
Great.
So we sit around in the dark all night.
So much fun. So much fun.
It's great.
You know what? I'm gonna go
and take Billy some food.
You think all the power's out
in the jaiI as well?
Oh, Iooks like the whoIe town's out.
Yeah. No, of course not. The whoIe
town's out. The whoIe town's out.
At the concert, having a good time
like we should be.
Here, take this with you.
Oh, thanks.
- See you Iater.
- See you, babe.
- See you.
- Bye.
Hello?
Guys?
Guys.
Guys.
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go see Billy.
- CooI.
- And give you guys some privacy.
Happy Halloween, asshoIe.
Son of a bitch!
There you go.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd hang out
with Billy and Cruz.
Cruz isn't here.
What? That's weird.
She left with food about 20 minutes ago.
Well, where is she?
I thought she came here.
Maybe she changed her mind.
Visiting hours are over.
Come in the morning.
Oh, come on. Can't I just hang out here
for a IittIe whiIe?
Yeah, why don't you let him stay?
One more dead body to add to the piIe.
What the fuck?
This old bastard has been promising
to kill everybody.
He says his boys are coming
to break him out.
And it's just you and the drunk.
- Watch your mouth, kid. I'm sober now.
- It's probabIy best if you go.
Don't you want another hand
in case this guy's telling the truth?
You can stay until your friend gets here.
Then you can walk back to the hotel.
- What happened to you?
- Fucking kids hit me with a paint balloon.
That's why you should walk back
with the girI.
All right.
Hey, man.
So you taIked to my dad?
Yeah, I know, he's really, really, really,
extremeIy, monumentally pissed.
Well, I guess I expected that.
Yeah, he'll be here in the morning
to post baiI.
Did she say
what she's charging you with?
She didn't say,
but there was enough stuff for a feIony.
Man, I'm fucked, aren't I?
Yeah, he's creepy as fuck.
Where are you going?
Lita....
- What?
- I've been thinking.
Okay.
We both graduate in May.
And I was thinking
we couId move in together.
Gus, come on,
you know I'm moving to New York.
I've got my job Iined up.
But accounting is so boring.
Don't go.
Babe, we've taIked about this
a thousand times.
I'm going.
Then I'll go with you.
Look...
...Gus, I like you.
I might even Iove you.
But....
I don't know, I just--
I need to spend some time on my own.
You understand that?
Lita, I Iove you.
And I don't wanna Iose you.
Marry me.
What?
Oh, my God.
You're proposing to me
in some fIeabag moteI...
...in the middIe of West Virginia?
Gus, come on.
- It's the thought that counts.
- Yeah.
Babe...
...come on.
Get dressed before Julian comes back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm sorry.
All right. I heard you. Keep your shirt on.
Who the fuck are you?
You got the wrong hotel room, pal.
Move along.
Are you so fucking drunk
you don't speak English?
I said, move along, you dumb shit.
Gus, who was that?
Some drunk guy from the festivaI.
CouIdn't find his room.
CooI costume though.
Fuck. Stupid shower.
Stupid shower doesn't work.
It's freezing.
Goddamn, you son of a bitch.
Look, I aIready told your drunk IittIe buddy
you got the wrong room.
What is it with you peopIe?
What, are you fucking retarded?
Gus?
Gus, what was that?
So where the hell is Cruz?
It can't have taken her this long to get here.
- I don't know. You want me to Iook for her?
- She's probabIy dead.
My boys aIready got to her on the street.
Shut the fuck up, old man.
You can say what you like, college boy...
...but your reckoning is on its way.
Hey, can you just shut
this old bastard up?
I can't stand Iistening to him anymore.
Well, I can't gag him
if that's what you're saying.
Give me five minutes with him
and he'll be quiet for the night.
You've got yourself in enough troubIe,
young man. Just ignore him.
Gus?
Gus?
No.
PIease.
No.
That's probabIy her now.
Hey, sweetheart.
- How's it going?
- It's been an interesting night.
Yeah. I saw the power outage
and I thought I'd bring you some candIes.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, honey.
- Mose, can you Iight some of these for me?
- Sure.
So, what's going on?
I've got a fugitive who's being picked up
by the marshaIs...
...and a kid on drug charges.
- And I bet your night is just starting.
- Yeah, probabIy is.
- You hungry?
- Starving.
Why don't call your deputies
and come home for a sandwich?
I can't reach them
and besides, I should really stay here.
Those guys aren't going anywhere.
Take some time for yourself, you know?
Even the sheriff is entitIed
to a Iunch break.
- Jason.
- All right.
I'll go fix some sandwiches
and I'll be back in a bit.
Last supper.
What's his probIem?
- Who is that guy?
- Don't ask.
Okay. See you soon.
See you Iater.
Help!
Somebody help!
PIease! Help!
Help me!
Stop! PIease stop!
Somebody help!
Somebody!
Help!
Help me!
Let me go, you crazy fuck.
What are you doing?
No.
No. No.
PIease, no, no.
Fifty cents.
Buck.
Call.
Who are they?
I don't know.
I never seen the truck before.
I told you.
It's my boys. They're here to get me.
Shit.
- Help!
- That's Gus.
Somebody, please!
Help!
Help!
Oh, God. We gotta get him out
of the middIe of the road.
Oh, I can't. I can't.
Give me a hand.
One down, huh, sheriff?
You're not going anywhere
and you're gonna pay for this.
You hear me, you bastard?
What are we gonna do?
Get out.
- I need to find Cruz.
- And Lita.
Listen to me.
You're all deputized.
If you help me, it will go a long way
in my report to the court.
- But I wanna go after my girIfriend.
- No, we all stay here.
We hold out until help arrives.
Mose, you watch the front door.
You two, cover the windows.
They want us to split up. It makes it easier
for them to kill us that way.
So we should stick together,
here until dawn. Now, get to your stations.
- We need to call for help.
- Lines are dead. Cell too.
Sheriff, Lee has a short-wave radio
in the back of his thrift store. I've seen it.
- We need power to operate it.
- Lee has a generator. Good thinking.
Listen, I'm gonna go across
the street to the store.
I'm gonna fire up the short-wave
and call for help.
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.
You stay
and make sure they don't get in.
Not a bright idea there, sheriff.
- SpIit up and die, remember?
- He's right.
I will not risk your Iives.
This is my job.
Now, cover me when I'm on the street.
Okay.
Okay, where are you?
Okay, come on.
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Gas.
Gas.
Yeah.
Okay.
- We should go help her.
- Nope. I gave my word I'd stay here.
- I'll go.
- Give it a minute.
- Just-- If we hear another shot, we'll go.
- But we don't--
We don't know this woman.
She's not Cruz or Lita.
- We should be going after them. Just wait.
- Let's go find the girIs.
If you leave, they'll throw the book at you.
Wait a few minutes, see if she comes.
- If she does, we'll tell her we're both going.
- All right.
Ten minutes.
This is Sheriff Carter of FairIake
decIaring emergency.
Ls anyone out there? Over.
Sheriff Carter of Fairlake, West Virginia
declaring an emergency.
Can anyone hear me? Over.
Yup, l hear you, sheriff.
What's your name and where are you?
Teddy Tabet.
I'm in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire.
Okay, listen to me carefully, Teddy.
L need you to call the Virginia State Police
in Moundsville.
Have them send every avaiIabIe officer
to FairIake right away.
It's an emergency.
What's going on down there?
The town is under siege by three hillbillies.
They're trying to break...
...one of their relatives out of jail.
They've already killed one person already.
Did you say FairIake, West Virginia?
Yes, that's right.
And we have no phone service.
So I need you to call the state poIice
right away. Can you do that?
Okay, okay. One minute.
Are you stoned?
What?
Are you stoned or do you just think
I'm stupid?
What are you taIking about, Teddy?
I need your help.
Tonight's the Mountain Man Festival,
right?
You think it would be funny
to scrambIe the entire state poIice...
...because you convinced
some dork to call?
This is reaI.
I am the sheriff and I need your help.
This is serious, Teddy.
Hey, listen, it's a felony
to file a fake police report, okay?
I'm not stupid. We here in Dixville Notch
are a pretty savvy bunch.
You can't pull the wooI over my eyes.
So, yeah, have a good night, officer.
Wait, wait, wait. PIease, Iisten, Teddy,
you gotta beIieve me.
This is a matter of Iife and death.
- Shit.
- What was that?
Somebody dying.
You beIieve me now, asshoIe?
Just call the poIice.
- I think I got one of them.
- Shit, shit.
You idiot. What if that was the sheriff?
Are you hurt?
Oh, my God. Is that Gus?
Is that Gus?
Come inside.
Oh, my God.
All right, okay.
You're all right. You're all right.
Julian, let me in.
- What happened?
- This drunk nearIy killed my friend.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- He has no business carrying a gun.
- It was an accident!
- I should beat this shit out of you!
- Hey, caIm down. CaIm down.
I said, caIm down.
- Were you hit?
- No.
Okay. Have you seen Cruz?
Were you with her?
She left before Julian.
She's dead, Iover boy.
ProbabIy being digested right now.
My boys have a taste for fIesh...
...especially cute IittIe bIonds.
Will you shut the fuck up?
If anything happened to her,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Let me go...
...and maybe the rest of them
will Iive to see the dawn.
You're not getting out of there.
There's four of you and one of her.
Think how much you wanna Iive.
You're out of your mind if you think
any one of us is gonna let you out.
Suit yourselves.
Did you reach anybody
on the short-wave?
- Yes.
- Great. That means help is coming.
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?
The dumb shit on the other Iine,
I don't think he beIieved me.
- I'm going to Iook for Cruz.
- Hey, I told you, no.
- Well, then you better Iock me back up.
- What?
All right, I may be a fuck-up.
I'm irresponsibIe, I'm unreIiabIe
and I'm definiteIy juveniIe, but I am IoyaI.
I Iove Cruz.
I Iove her more than anything
I've ever Ioved in my Iife...
...and I'm not gonna sit in here
whiIe she's out there on her own.
I couIdn't Iive with myseIf if I did that.
So either Iock me up or let me go.
- Here, you're gonna need this.
- Thank you.
- I'm going with you.
- All right.
You gonna be all right?
Be carefuI.
We will.
We'll Iook around here,
see if we can find her.
All right. Keep your eyes open.
Cruz.
Cruz, it's Billy.
Come out.
If Cruz knows what's up,
she'll be hiding and won't come out.
Yeah.
I hope that's the case.
- Mister?
- Call me Mose.
Why are they doing this?
They wanna break him out, I suppose.
But killing innocent peopIe?
Why kill Gus?
He had nothing to do
with keeping that old guy Iocked up.
I get the feeIing that killing ain't too much
of a stretch for this bunch.
What if no help comes?
It will. Don't worry.
And Billy and Julian?
They'll find your friend...
...and then they'll be back.
Cruz!
Are you out there?
- Where the hell couId she be?
- I don't know, man.
Jesus Christ.
What the hell was that?
Move, Billy.
Shit. Shit.
We gotta get out of the street.
We're sitting ducks.
There.
Oh, shit. Cruz.
Oh, my God, baby.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Cruz.
What kind of fucking animaIs are they?
There's nothing we can do for her now.
I'm taking her back.
I'm not gonna leave her here
like some piece of trash.
Oh, Jesus.
Son of a bitch.
Billy!
Julian.
Julian.
Wake up!
- Fuck.
- Shit.
Oh, God, Bi--
- Billy, what's going on?
- I can't move.
I can't move.
You gotta get out of that chain, man.
Chain?
Can you get out?
Shit.
Fuck. No. Just-- No.
- Fuck.
- No, there's--
We gotta call for help. All right?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Help us, anybody!
- Help!
- Anybody!
- Help!
Fuck.
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?
Oh, my, God. Oh, my, God.
Help!
Help!
Help us!
Anybody!
Help!
Julian. Julian, save me.
Save-- Help me, man!
What the--? What the fuck?
No, don't. No, don't.
Fuck.
No, don't-- Don't leave me.
Julian, don't leave me. Don't leave me.
No!
No! No! No!
Julian! Stop it, you motherfucker!
What--?
We can't sit here all night
and wait for them to come back.
- Somebody needs to go for help.
- Yes, and that has to be you, Mose.
Can you do it?
Hey, Lita.
Why don't you save yourself?
How?
Convince her to let me out of here.
- I can do it, sheriff.
- Take my truck.
Take it to the fairgrounds
and find Junior...
...and the other deputies
and bring them back here.
Do not stop for anyone or anything.
Me and my boys will go...
...disappear into the night.
You'll be safe.
I don't trust you.
Why would I stick around here?
Think about it.
You're a college kid. Use your head.
Save yourself and your friends.
Mose...
...you okay?
I couId do with a drink.
I won't.
You can count on me, AngeIa.
I know not too many peopIe have counted
on me in the past to do anything right...
...but I'm turning over a new Ieaf,
starting tonight.
I will be back with help. I promise.
Why don't you just give them
what they want? Give them the old man.
- You can track them when you have help.
- No. I want justice.
Justice?
What about justice for my boyfriend
whose body is Iying on your porch?
What about justice for Gus, huh?
Don't you see?
If I let him go, you may never get justice
for your boyfriend.
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
to you, but you're not changing my mind.
You ready?
Let's do this.
There's a radio in my truck.
Keep in constant contact and be carefuI.
My truck is at the gas station
by the junkyard.
I'll cover you.
Go. Go, go.
God, come on, come on, come on.
PIease, please, please start.
You can do it.
Mose, can you hear me?
L got you, sheriff.
L'm on my way like a bat out of hell.
I need you there in one piece.
Not too fast, okay?
Roger that.
I'm just getting on the highway now,
sheriff.
No sign of them.
Good, keep me posted.
I told you, I wouldn't let you--
Shit.
Mose?
Mose?
Mose? Come in, Mose.
Mose?
Billy and Julian should have been back
by now, shouldn't they?
I know.
They're dead, aren't they?
We don't know that.
I don't wanna die here.
Neither do I.
I wanna leave.
There's no pIace to go.
There must be a car
or a truck or something.
- Mose took my only truck.
- Well, then I'll steaI a car. Anything.
I just need to get the fuck out of here.
You know how to hot-wire a car?
No.
Look, the festivaI will be over soon.
My deputies will be back.
We just have to wait a IittIe longer.
- And what if I can't wait that long?
- You really don't have a choice.
To go out there now by yourself
would be suicide.
Not if you come with me.
I can't leave here.
There's two of us left.
What can we possibIy do
if they come for him?
Our best.
I think you're crazier than he is.
Sheriff. Help me, sheriff.
Sheriff!
Sheriff. Sheriff. Help me.
Oh, no. PIease. Don't do it.
Help me.
You can surprise her.
Take her weapon
and force her to let me out.
- I can't.
- She's just a woman.
Leave me alone.
I wanna see you Iive.
You're smart, Lita. Too smart to die.
I said, leave me alone.
You're smarter than your friends.
Hell, you even got away
from my boys once.
You deserve to Iive.
I will tell my boys to let you Iive...
...if you help me.
I don't beIieve you.
Well...
...you and that bitch are certainIy gonna die
if you just stand there and do nothing.
That I can guarantee you.
No. No.
No.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Do you hear that?
What?
It's Mose.
Well, where's it coming from?
He's in the thrift store. Here, take this.
Watch him.
If anyone comes in, shoot them.
- Wha--? What are you gonna do?
- What I can.
Oh, God.
Now's your chance.
No.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Save yourself.
Have some vision.
You're smart.
And you wanna Iive, don't you?
Yes.
Well, then open this cell.
I will go away and so will my boys.
Think.
- How can I trust you?
- Well, you have the gun, don't you?
You open this cell...
...and I will walk away.
Promise.
The keys are in the gun Iocker
to your left.
That's it.
Good girI.
It is as simpIe as turning a key in a Iock.
That right there in your hand
is the key to your Iife.
If I let you out of here...
...you let me go free, right?
You and your men,
you don't come after me.
That's the deaI, right?
Done deaI.
If you try anything...
...I swear to God, I will kill you.
All I want is to get out of here.
Back up.
Go.
Okay, get out of here. Slowly.
Move.
You know, Lita, you did the right thing.
Just get out of here.
Oh, and...
...you know what I was saying
about vision?
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me.
- Lita?
- My eyes.
God.
I warned you, bitch.
Goddamn it.
Lita. Come on. Come on.
- My eyes.
- You're gonna be all right.
- You're gonna be all right.
- My eyes.
Come on.
- Come on. Go.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Get your fucking hands up.
- Get--
- Fuck you.
I'm gonna bandage you
to stop the bIeeding, okay?
Put your head back.
Oh, God, I'm so stupid.
Okay, sweetie, okay.
What happened?
He promised.
He promised he would just leave
if I let him out.
- And you beIieved him?
- I didn't know what eIse to do.
Lita, you're gonna have to Iisten to me
if we're gonna make it out aIive.
- Can you do that?
- Yes.
Good.
What about me? I'm bIeeding here.
Yeah, you're on your own.
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.
Not if you die first.
Go ahead. Shoot me again.
- Get it over with.
- Don't tempt me.
You're a fucking coward.
You don't have the guts.
I'm gonna be there
when they stick a needIe in your arm.
Yeah.
Well, you just go right on telling
yourself that, baby.
I'm gonna go for help.
You stay here and don't do anything,
okay?
- I'm gonna Iock the door behind me.
- You ain't never coming back, bitch.
Jason?
Jason.
No. Oh, no. Jason.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I want you to remember this voice, Lita...
...because it's gonna be the Iast one
you'll ever hear.
I'm gonna whisper in your ear
right before I sIit your throat...
...which is only a matter of time now.
Just shut up. Shut up.
Maybe I won't kill you right away.
Maybe I'll keep you aIive a IittIe whiIe.
Yeah.
Because I'm gonna fuck you.
No.
Shut up, just shut up!
And then my three boys
are gonna fuck you.
No.
And then when we're done...
...I'm gonna cut your titties off
as a souvenir.
Oh, God.
You run away.
That makes it more fun.
You run, IittIe girI.
Because I'm coming to get you.
Well, now, Iooks like
we've come full circIe, huh, sheriff?
I Iove irony.
- Don't you?
- They'll find you.
Oh, I highIy doubt that.
We're just fixing to leave town.
I hope you burn in hell.
Well, now, sorry to disappoint,
but you're the one that's gonna burn.
All right, boys, that'll do it.
Now, sheriff,
out of the kindness of my heart...
...I am offering you a choice...
...which is reaI gentIemanlike of me,
don't you think?
Fuck you.
A fighter to the end, huh?
AdmirabIe.
Now...
...as I am a man of mercy, let me expIain
to you what is happening here.
I am gonna duct-tape this shotgun
to your mouth...
...and I have attached a wire
to the trigger...
...which is aIso attached to your foot.
So that when you come down
off your tippy-toes...
...the wire is gonna pull the trigger.
Essentially, I am offering you a way out,
sheriff.
If I were you, I would take it...
...because burning to death
is one painfuI way to die.
You son of a bitch.
Tick tock, sheriff.
Gotta go.
There, that ought to do it.
Now, all you have to do...
...is let go.
HeeIs to the fIoor and:
No more.
Oh, you don't need to thank me, sheriff.
You hang on in there, huh?
All right, let's get out of here.
Stop.
Stop. PIease.
Stop.
Help me.
PIease help me.
Help me.
Help me.
PIease help me.
Oh, please.
Oh, thank God you stopped.
They killed my friends.
You need to call the police
before they kill the sheriff, please.
PIease help me.
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.
Welcome home, Lita.
No!
No!
No!
No!
