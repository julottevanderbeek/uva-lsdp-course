We're all infected.
We all carry it.
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
We haven't had this much space
since we left the farm.
It's secure?
This cell block is.
He hates me. He's too good
a man to say it, but I know.
Only one way to
keep you alive...
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?
He's bleeding out.
We gotta go back.
Come around here.
Put pressure on the knee.
Hard, hard!
Push, push.
Why don't you come on
out of there? Slow and steady.
What happened to him?
- He got bit.
- Bit?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.
Nobody needs to get hurt.
- I need you to hold this.
- Okay.
- As hard as you can.
- Yes.
You have medical supplies?
Wow. Where do you
think you're going?
Who the hell
are you people, anyway?
Don't look like no rescue team.
If a rescue team is what
you're waiting for, don't.
Come on, we gotta go!
Now! Come on!
I need a hand here.
One, two, three, go!
- Holy Jesus!
- T, the door.
- Andrew: Are you crazy? Don't open that!
- Rick:
Rick:
Daryl. Daryl!
Let's go.
Rick:
This way.

Rick:
This way, this way.
No, no, no.
Back, back!
-
Come on!
Stop, stop.
Man:
Come on, let's go.
Go, go.
Go, go, go.
-
- Rick: Easy, easy.
- He's losing too much blood.
- Open the door!
It's Hershel!
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy!
Go, go, go, go, go.
In there.
- Turn it. Turn it. Turn around.
- This way.
Get him on the bed.
Daryl:
He got bit.
- Oh, my God, he's gonna turn.
- Did you cut it off?
- Yeah.
- Maybe you got it in time.
- Ready?
- Okay.
One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
- Carol: Oh, God.
Oh!
Oh, I need bandages.
- We used everything we had.
- Well, get more. Anything.
Carl, go get the towels from the
back, right next to my bed.
- Is he gonna die?
- No, no, no, no.
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.
You think you can
stabilize him?
I need to keep his leg elevated.
Get some pillows!
He's already bled
through the sheets.
We can burn the wound to clot the blood.
I can start a fire.
- No, please don't do this.
- Carol:
It's not gonna stop
the arteries from bleeding.
We need to just keep it dressed
and let it heal on its own.
Oh, God.
That's far enough.
Cell block C.
Cell 4--
that's mine, gringo.
Let me in.
Today's your
lucky days, fellas.
You've been pardoned by the State of Georgia.
You're free to go.
- What you got going on in there?
- It ain't none of your concern.
Don't be telling me
what's my concern.
Chill, man.
Dude's leg is messed up.
Besides, we're free now.
Why are we still in here?
- The man's got a point.
- Yeah, and I gotta check on my old lady.
A group of civilians breaking  to
a prison you got no business being in--
got me thinking there ain't
no place for us to go.
- Why don't you go find out?
- Maybe we'll just be going now.
- Hey, we ain't leaving.
- You aren't coming in either.
Hey, this is my house, my rules.
I go where I damn well please.
- What was that?
- Prisoners, survivors.
- Glenn:
Do not leave his side.
If he dies, you need
to be there for that.
You think you can do this?
- Maggie will be there.
- I got it.
- I can bring T in...
- I got it.
Good.
There ain't nothing
for you here.
Why don't you go back
to your own sandbox?
How many of you are in there?
Too many for you to handle.
You guys rob a bank
or something?
Why don't you take him
to a hospital?
How long have you been
locked in that cafeteria?
Going on like 10 months.
Big Tiny:
Never seen anything like it.
Axel:
Attica on speed, man.
Ever heard about
dudes going cannibal,
dying, coming back to life?
Crazy.
One guard looked out for us,
locked us up in the cafeteria.
Told us sit tight, threw me this
piece, said he'd be right back.
Yeah, and that
was 292 days ago.
- 94 according to my calcula--
- Shut up!
Oscar: We were thinking that
the army or the national guard
should be showing up
any day now.
Rick:
There is no army.
What do you mean?
There's no government,
no hospitals, no police.
- For real?
- I'm serious.
What about my moms?
My kids?
And my old lady?
Yo, you got a cell phone or something
that we can call our families?
You just don't get it, do you?
No phones, no computers.
As far as we can see, at leas half
the population has been wiped out.
- Ain't no way.
- See for yourself.
Oscar:
Damn, the sun feels good.
Axel: Good lord.
They're all dead.
Tomas: Never thought I'd be
so happy to see these fences.
Andrew:
how the hell did you get
in here in the first place?
Cut a hole in that fence
over there by that guard tower.
- That easy, huh?
- Where there's a will there's a way.
Easy for you to say.
So what is this,
like a disease?
Yeah, and we're all infected.
Axel: What do you mean infected?
Like AIDS or something?
Daryl: If I was to kill you,
shoot an arrow in your chest,
you'd come back
as one of these things.
It's gonna happen to all of us.
Ain't no way this
Robinhood casts
responsible for killing
all these freaks.
Must be 50 bodies out here.
Where'd you come from?
Atlanta.
Where are you headed?
For now, nowhere.
I guess you can take that area
down there near the water.
Should be comfortable.
We're using
that field for crops.
- We'll help you move your gear out.
- Rick:
We took out these walkers.
This prison is ours.
Slow down, cowboy.
You snatched the locks
off our doors.
We'll give you new locks,
if that's how you want it.
This is our prison.
We were here first.
Locked in a broom closet?
We took it, set you free.
It's ours.
We spilled blood.
- We're moving back into our cell block.
- You'll have to get your own.
It is mine. I've still got
personal artifacts in there.
- That's about as mine as it gets.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maybe let's try to make this
work out so everybody wins.
- I don't see that happening.
- Neither do I.
I ain't going back in that
cafeteria for one more minute.
There are other cell blocks.
You could leave.
Try your luck out on the road.
If these three pussies
can do all this,
the least we can do is take
out another cell block.
With what?
Atlanta here will spot us
some real weapons.
Won't you, boss?
How stocked is that cafeteria?
It must have plenty of food.
Five guys lasting
almost a year?
It sure as hell don't look
like anybody's been starving.
- There's only a little left.
- We'll take half.
In exchange, we'll help
clear out a cell block.
Didn't you hear him?
There's only a little left.
Bet you got more food
than you got choices.
You pay, we'll play.
We'll clear out a block for
you, then you keep to it.
- All right.
- Well, let's be clear.
If we see you out here
anywhere near our people,
if I so much as even catch
a whiff of your scent,
I will kill you.
Deal.
It has to stop
eventually, right?
It slowed down
quite a bit already.
If we can get him
through this--
When we get him through this.
--we'll need crutches.
Right now we could use
some antibiotics
and painkillers,
some sterile gauze.
There's got to be
an infirmary here.
If there is, we'll find it.
You've gotta be worried sick
about delivering the baby.
Look at me.
Do I look worried?
You look disgusting.
So do you.
We'll get through this.
Pantry's back here.
You never tried
to break out of here?
then those freaks'll be
lined up outside the door
growling, trying to get in.
Windows got bars on there that
he-man couldn't get through.
- Bigger than a 5x8.
- Big Tiny:
Doing 15. My left leg can barely
fit on one of those bunks.
Oscar: Yeah, they don't call
him Big Tiny for nothing.
You done jerking
each other off?
Sick of waiting back here.
This what you call
a little bit of food?
- Goes fast.
- Mm-hmm.
You can have a bag of
corn, some tuna fish--
We said half.
That's the deal.
- What's in there?
- Oscar:
He wanted to know.
Can't wait for
my own pot to piss in.
It was stupid of us
to let him go.
We cleared this whole cell
block, just the five of us.
It could have
happened to anyone.
What are we gonna
do without him?
Hey, stop it.
All right? Stop it.
He's still here.
What if he does wake up?
Then what?
He can't even walk.
All we do is run.
Hey...
this won't break him.
Okay?
He's got you and Beth.
Am I the only person
living in reality here?
We've been through
so much already.
You're expecting it, too.
I'm not expecting, all right?
I'm just preparing.
Why don't you go check on Beth?
Go on.
I'll watch him.
- What are you doing? - He's gonna
have a hard time walking around
with one side of his pants
dragging on the ground.
You know, he could
trip or something.
There's a good chance
he won't wake up.
- Why are you so eager to give up on him?
-
It sure sounds like it.
I don't want you to get
your hopes too high.
We're not equipped to deal
with something like this.
- We have Carol.
- She's not a doctor.
Dad taught her a few things
to help with the baby.
She stopped the bleeding.
These'll do just fine.
- T-Dog: Food's here.
- What you got?
Canned beef, canned corn,
canned cans.
There's a lot more
where this came from.
Any change?
Bleeding is under control
and no fever,
but his breath is labored
and his pulse is way down
and he hasn't opened
his eyes yet.
Take my cuffs, put them on him.
I'm not taking any chances.
Yeah.
So what about those prisoners?
We're gonna help them
clear out their own cell block,
and then they'll be there
and we'll be here.
- Living beside each other.
- I'm not giving up this prison.
- Do they have guns?
- I only saw one.
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna work.
Well, what are your options?
Kill them.
If that's what
you think is best.
You s--
you say this now...
Look, I know that
I'm a shitty wife
and I'm not winning
any mother of the year awards,
but I need you to know that...
not for one second do I think
there is malice in your heart.
You're not a killer,
and I know that.
I know that, so--
so do whatever you gotta do
to keep this group safe.
And do it with
a clear conscience.
Why do I need this
when I got this?
Daryl:
not unless your back's
up against a wall.
Noise attracts them.
It really riles them up.
We'll go in two by two.
Daryl will run point with T.
I'll bring up
the rear with you.
Stay tight, hold formation
no matter how close
the walkers get...
anyone breaks ranks,
we could all go down.
Anyone runs off,
they could get mistaken
for a walker,
end up with an axe to the head.
And that's where you aim.
These things only go down
with a head shot.
Ain't gotta tell us
how to take out a man.
They ain't men.
They're something else.
Just remember to go
for the brain.
What's going on?
- We had to.
- It's just a precaution.
You think maybe I could have
a minute alone here?
Yeah, you want me to--?
No, just by myself.
Of course.
I'll be right outside.
Dad...
you don't have
to fight anymore.
If you're worried
about me and Beth, don't.
Don't worry about us.
We'll take care of each other.
We'll look out.
Me, Beth, and Glenn
will look out.
Go ahead, dad.
It's okay.
Be peaceful.
You don't have to fight.
If it's time to go, it's okay.
Daddy, I just want
to thank you.
For everything, thank you.
Man, it's too
damn dark in here.
Gotta hold it up high
out in front of you.
- It's coming!
- Rick:
You wanna taste me?
I thought you were
organizing the food.
Even better.
Check it out.
Where did you get this?
From the infirmary.
- You went by yourself?
- Yeah.
Are you crazy?
No big deal. I killed two walkers.
You-- all right,
do you see this?
This was with the whole group.
We needed supplies,
so I got them.
- I appreciate that, but--
- Then get off my back. - Carl!
She's your mother.
You can't talk to her like that.
Listen, I think it's great
that you wanna help--
It's gotta be the brain.
Not the stomach,
not the heart-- the brain.
I hear you.
The brain.
- Like that?
- Uh-huh.
Stay in tight formation.
No more prison riot crap.
Ah!
These bandages will help
prevent infection.
It's good.
It's good that he taught
you all this stuff.
He didn't teach me everything.
I need your help
with something.
- Now?
- Yeah, now.
- What is it?
- Not here.
I can't leave Hershel.
- This is important.
- Carol, I can't--
- Go on. We got it.
- Glenn:
- We'll be fine.
- We're not gonna be gone long.
- Rick said for me--
- We're fine.
All right.
I'm telling you, I don't feel anything.
It's just a scratch.
- I'm sorry, man.
- I can keep fighting!
You cut that old guy's leg
off to save his life.
- Look at where the bite is.
- Guys, I'm fine!
Just-- I'm fine.
Look at me-- I'm not changing
into one of those things.
Oscar: Look, man, there has
to be something we can do.
- We could just lock him up.
- Quarantine him.
We gotta do something.
Why you just standing there?
- We gotta save him.
- There's nothing we can do.
You son of a bitch.
I'm all ri--
Carol:
Everything you're saying
is completely sane.
You're wanting to use a walker
for practice is a sane thing.
I mean it, okay.
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to wrap my mind around it.
Carol:
Lori's overdue.
She had Carl by C-section.
She's probably gonna have
to have this one the same way.
Hershel had a little bit of
experience with this kind of thing,
but he's not gonna
be able to do it anymore.
I need experience
and we have plenty of cadavers.
All right, well, like I
said, it's completely sane.
I need to learn
how to cut through
the abdomen and the uterus
without cutting the baby.
Why not?
I'll do it.
Okay.
Come on!
Hey, follow me. Come on.
Right here, come on.
You see the look on his face?
He makes one move,
just give me a signal.
- I ain't opening that.
- Yes, you are.
you're gonna open that door.
Just the one, not both of them.
Because we need
to control this.
You bitches ready?
I got this.
- I said one door!
- Shit happens.
T, mind the gap.
- It was coming at me, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.
I get it.
Shit happens.
No!
Ah!
Easy, now.
I got him.
Man, get down on your knees.
We don't have no affiliation
to what just happened.
Tell him, Oscar.
Stop talking, man.
Let me back in, man.
Let me back in!
Open it up, man!
Open up!
- Open up.
- You'd better run.
What's happening?
Do something!
Somebody help!
Somebody!
Please help!
Come on.
No!
- We didn't have nothing to do with that.
- You didn't know?
You knew.
Daryl, let's end this now.
Sir, please, please,
listen to me!
It was them that was bad.
It wasn't us.
- Oh, that's convenient.
- You saw what he did to Tiny.
He was my friend.
Please, we ain't like that.
I like my pharmaceuticals,
but I'm no killer.
Oscar here, he's a B and E,
and he ain't very good
at it neither.
We ain't the violent kind,
they were!
Please, I swear to God!
I wanna live!
What about you?
I ain't never pleaded
for my life.
And I ain't about to start now.
So you do what you gotta do.
Oh, man.
Axel:
They were good men.
Let's go.
- Man, this is sick.
- We're locking down this cell block.
From now on, this part
of the prison is yours.
Take it or leave it.
That was the deal.
You think this is sick?
You don't wanna know
what's outside.
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.
Sorry about your friends, man.
A word of advice--
take those bodies outside
and burn them.
Hershel stopped breathing.
- Mom saved him.
- It's true.
Still no fever.
Daddy?
Daddy.
Daddy.
Come here.
We'll start cleaning tomorrow.
Yeah. It'll give
Carl a safe place to...
do whatever he does these days.
For the record, I-- I don't
think you're a bad mother.
Well, wife
is a different story.
For better or worse, right?
I mean, what are
we gonna do-- hire lawyers
We got food. Hershel's alive.
Today was a good day.
He'd be dead
if it weren't for you.
You're the one that acted fast.
If you hadn't done
what you did, then...
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.
Maybe there's nothing
to talk about anymore.
We're awful grateful
for what you did.
