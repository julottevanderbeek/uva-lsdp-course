Welcome to Woodbury.
Governor:
Governor: Well, that's my wife,
that's my daughter and me.
Don't hurt my little girl.
I want Michonne.
Governor: Turn her over and
all this goes away.
He wants the prison.
Michonne:
We should finish him.
What the hell are you doing!?
Man: - It's not worth it.
- That was a slaughter.
Governor: I've been on the
road for a couple of months.
Woman:

Woman 2: You look like
you barely
- Woman:
Woman:
We're a little on edge.
We've been holed up in here waiting
for the National Guard since...
- The shit hit the fan.
- Language.
Since the crap hit the fan.
Which it did
right before it got flung
all over the damn place.
Are you planning
on staying in the building?
Are you planning on
staying or not?
- Holy shit, with the no talking.
- Tara.
My sister asked you a question.
Just for the night.
You see this?
This here is a fully loaded,
standard issue Smith & Wesson.
I'm Atlanta City Police
and I have enough artillery
in here to kill you
every day
for the next 10 years.
You mess with me or my family,
and I swear to Christ,
I will put you down.
Got it?
Got it.
Then we're cool.
Pound it.
Here, bro.
We'll hold onto this
until you go.
Yeah.
You got a name?
Brian.
Brian Heriot.
You got to be hungry.
You're not gonna find
anything better in there.
Tara ransacked the place
after Miss Wilhelm
took off for Florida.
Big fan of butter beans,
Miss Wilhelm.
Thank you.
Four, five.
Come on, kiddo.
Show me what you got here.
Woman:
Everything okay?
She didn't eat, again.
She likes the corned beef.
Try that.
She's not picky,
she's terrified.
-
-
Why don't you slow down,
buddy, all right?
This ain't the Holiday Inn.
Bucket on the left
is for washing,
right is for rinsing.
Tara.
Oh.
Sorry.
You get enough to eat?
I'll get you some coffee.
Sit down.
Right there.
Go on.
Man:
Go ahead, roll again.
Hey, come here.
You got a cigarette?
Woman:
Do you not see
that red sticker?
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra
Menthol is gonna blow this place up
after all the work we've done
to stay alive up here. Okay?
It's all the same, Lily.
You can stop
that talk right there.
It's just a cigarette.
Help yourself.
We got roni sticks for days.
Years, probably.
You see that big truck
parked outside?
Come on, dude,
the Gorbelli food truck.
Ray Charles could have seen it.
Yeah.
Dad drove for them.
Even with the tank.
The day they closed down
the 75...
When the S-H-I-T
hit the fan.
He grabbed Megan from school,
picked me up at the hospital...
She stole a bunch of oxygen
tanks from that dump.
Then the three of us
rushed over to get Tara.
I was at the station
working, booking.
With everything going on,
the attacks, the Army
going into Atlanta,
he wasn't about to let us
out of his sight.
Tara: Lucky for us, the old man's
truck was pretty much stocked
Man: Meg, Granddad
needs a break, okay?
- Lily.
- Sure, Daddy.
On three.
A little help here, big guy.
Lily:
Here.
Oh, right.
No, not you.
The other big guy in the room.
Lily:
Tara.
-
- Lily: Okay.
On three.
Okay, one, two...
Here. Here.
-
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get my legs, friend?
Tara's been up there
a bunch of times
blasting them bastards
to pieces.
She says they just
keep getting back up.
I told her no more.
Can't afford to waste
her bullets.
You got kids?
No.
When my girls were born,
that's when I finally figured
out what it was to be a man.
You know, a real man.
You protect them,
you keep them safe.
You just try
to make them stronger
until they can
look out for themselves.
But this here,
I... I never counted
on this.
Hey, I got a buddy.
Bill Jenkins,
he lives up in 303.
He's got a real nice
backgammon set up there.
He won't mind and he keeps
it under his bed there.
Just... please.
You've been out there
in the world
and you know how to handle
yourself around those things.
Look, I know you might
not understand it
'cause you don't got
a baby girl of your own,
it might be something that might
make my Megan talk again.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Couple things for the road.
I'm okay.
You helped us.
We're saying thank you.
Deal with it.
I guess you'll be
needing this back.
Keep it.
Don't...
throw that at me.
It's your gun.
You can have it back.
You need another one.
I have this.
Tara was right.
We should have frisked you.
I found it upstairs.
You keep that.
You have to kill the brain.
What?
Your sister, she shot
'em in the body,
but you have to hit 'em here.
That's what kills them.
Why?
I need to ask you something.
My dad's got stage four
lung cancer.
I worked oncology
for a few years.
He's nearing the end.
He's got about
two days of oxygen.
Maybe less.
We never thought
he'd make it this long.
You've already done
so much for us, but...
there's an old folks home
a couple of blocks from here.
Even one tank
would mean everything.
He's the only one who can
put a smile on Megan's face.
Even for a second.
- They're both full.
- Are you okay?
Yeah.
You didn't let me
say thank you.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Sit.
Let me be a nurse again.
Good news is it doesn't look
like you need any stitches.
Bad news...
this is gonna sting like
a couple of angry bees.
Feels good to have
something to do.
Nobody ever mentioned just how boring
the end of the world was gonna be.
She thought you were her dad.
Megan.
When she saw you
out there on the street.
He went out one night about
three and a half years ago
to get a couple beers
and a Powerball ticket.
Said he'd be right back.
Megan thought you were him,
finally coming right back.
- Megan:
Everything's okay, sweetheart.
Brian just got a boo-boo that
needs a little cleaning up.
Same as when you get a cut.
I don't have the ointment.
Why don't you watch
my patient until I get back?
Okay.
What happened to your eye?
It's gone.
Something happen to you
or were you just
born like that?
Something happened to me.
Was that bad to ask?
No.
I'll tell you what
happened to my eye,
but you have to promise
to keep it secret.
I promise.
What's that?
Pinkie swear.
Plus cross my heart
and hope to die.
Well...
I'm a pirate.
No way.
Yeah, you caught me.
What really happened was
I was trying to help someone.
Someone I loved very much.
How were you trying
to help them?
I was trying to protect
them, you know?
Stop them getting hurt.
But you got hurt instead.
Yeah.
Did they get hurt, too?
Uh...
yeah, yeah, they did.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
Megan:
What is it?
Chess.
Looks hard.
Well, maybe for some folks,
but you're smart.
You'll catch on quick.
What's this one called?
That's a pawn.
They're your soldiers.
Do they die?
Sometimes.
Do you lose if they die?
No, not necessarily.
You can lose a lot of soldiers,
but still win the game.
That's the king.
That's the guy
you want to capture.
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.
Looks like you.
Yeah.
Come on, let's play.
So these ones are pawns.
Lily:
He's gone.
I think he's been gone a while.
Y'all should go now.
Just give us a minute.
I love you, Daddy.
-
- Lily:
- Tara:
- Stop!
- It's not Dad!
I know, okay?
It happens no matter what?
Yeah.
He could have got me.
He almost got me.
he would have been grateful
that you stopped him,
from him...
you know what I mean?
So, yeah, we're cool.
Good-bye.
No.
- We're coming with you.
- No.
There has to be
someplace better,
and you're gonna
help us find it.
- Lily.
- I saw the picture, Brian.
You had a family, I know that.
And I know we're not them.
But for now,
you're stuck with us.
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.
- I can't.
You already have.
Tara:
Governor:
No use making a plan.
We'll go where they let us.
The roads.
The biters.
I'm not really a cop.
I mean, it's not a total lie.
I was in the academy.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
You don't have to be sorry.
We'll make it.
Are you lying to me?
No.
Lily: You can come
join us, Megan.
It's just gonna take some time.
It's okay.
Governor:
We'll find another car soon.
Tara:
I hope you're right.
This whole country backdrop
is reminding me of Sam.
- Lily: Here we go.
- I thought she was the one.
Then you went camping,
ate mushrooms, game over.
You're forgetting the part where Sam broke
down and told me she had a boyfriend,
that she wasn't
really into chicks.
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.
-
Oh, man.
Damn it!
-
- Tara, stop. Let me look at it.
- I'm fine!
Just hand me my backpack.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Let's go.
-
-
Drop your bags.
Let's go. Come on.
- Tara: Megan.
- Megan, come on.
-
Megan, come on.
Megan, right now.
Come on.
Come on, Megan.
Come on.
Lily:
Governor:
Go.
Move.
- Ah!
-
- Brian!
- I'm here.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
You all right?
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.
Okay?
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.
Holy shit.
Cross my heart.
