Previously on "The Originals"...
Freya: If this prophecy
is fulfilled,
you will all fall...
One by friend, one by foe,
and one by family.
- I'll find you.
- You won't.
There are things lurking
in the shadows,
and in the face of these,
you are nothing.
Aurora: The serratura.
My brother and Lucien
want to use it
to lock you
and your siblings away forever.
Klaus: Which is why they sent a
legion of Strix to collect my sister.
I decided to put her
someplace safe...
At the bottom of the ocean.
Elijah: Records show the very night
our sister was taken.
All we need to do
is match the path.
With the latitude
I plucked from Aurora.
You presume to know me?
I will end you for what
you did to Camille.
Tonight, I'd like you
to stay here,
where I can protect you.
Rebekah, voice-over: Marcel
once asked me what it feels like
being daggered.
I told him it's like
a deep, dreamless sleep,
but this is no ordinary dagger.
This stake ensures
I feel everything...
The aching cold,
the suffocating darkness,
the burn of my veins
crying out for blood,
and the long agony of waiting.
Right where he said it would be.
Open it.
This Mr. Elijah Smith
paid big money to have
this dredged out of the gulf.
What's ever in it,
it's got to be worth a fortune.
I say we renegotiate.
Elijah: I'm afraid that.
Was my final offer.
Aah!
Hello, sister.
Tell me I didn't miss Christmas.
Sync & corrections by
Do they, like, pay you?
Klaus: Handsomely and with
a generous Christmas bonus.
Isn't that right?
Legrow:  this Christmas
So you just compel her to nod
and agree with whatever you say?
I compel her to feed me
and to hang the occasional
Christmas ornament.
She can say whatever
the hell she wants.
You seem better.
Yeah. Thank you
for letting me stay here
for the past couple days
and giving me space
to not talk. Heh.
Trust me, baby, I...
Why didn't you go with
Elijah to help Rebekah?
I hope it's not to stay
and baby-sit me.
It's not a good idea
for he and I to spend
hours together
in confined spaces,
given that the prophecy
foretells
one family member
felling another.
You don't think
he would hurt you?
I don't know what to think...
On a Christmas Eve...
And that damn fortune
teller's predictions continue
to unfold despite
all our efforts.
It's Vincent.
I have to go.
Taking over my bar.
You don't really strike
me as a jazz fan.
You're a Strix now, Marcel.
What's yours is
our and vice versa.
You should be grateful.
You need my help, as I imagine
the Mikaelsons still
want your head.
This venue is brilliant.
A neutral space
where magic is useless.
It should do nicely,
at least until I install
a suitable regent to Shepherd
the local witches.
Well, that might take a while.
See, the last regent was shunned
and the one before
that murdered.
No one's really
eager to step up.
As a member
of this organization,
you should know that we do
not wait for men to step up.
We step them up.
Ok. So we install
an Ally as regent.
Good plan if you
can find a witch
willing to do your bidding.
In fact, I have a candidate...
Young, malleable.
His name is Van Nguyen.
It seems someone
killed his mother.
As it is Christmas and I am,
despite reputation,
a charitable man,
I made an offer.
He'll use his powers
to do as I ask.
You're jumpy.
Maybe that's from being
jumped so many times.
Yeah.
I haven't been out
since everything.
What's up?
I need fed you to
make a house call.
Kinney got fired last week.
- What?
- Yeah.
No, but he... He's a good cop.
Yeah, he was a good cop
until he started
having blackouts,
going Mia when he's
supposed to be on duty.
I mean, there are gaping
holes in his reports,
arrests he can't explain,
missing evidence
he can't explain,
and now he's isolating,
he's not coming out of the house,
he's not taking my phone calls.
I'll go see him.
There has to be something I can say.
Thank you.
I know you needed space, Jack,
but I kind of eventually
thought you would come home.
Right. To the apartment Elijah
compelled somebody to rent us
and the bedroom
that looks in on his library.
- Do you love him?
- Jack.
Just tell me the truth for once.
You knew... You knew
when you married me.
It's been a year.
I have stood by you,
I have fought for you,
I have loved you
and you daughter,
and do you know
what the worst part is?
Coming out of those
woods just now,
seeing you sitting there,
I'll be damned if it wasn't
the best thing I had ever seen.
Even when I'm pissed as hell,
I would rather be near
you than anywhere else.
Now what kind of fool
does that make me?
My feelings for Elijah
are complicated...
But that doesn't mean
that I love you any less, Jack.
I chose you,
and I choose you again
every single day.
Can't that be enough?
It's our first
Christmas together.
I've never had a happy one.
I just want a quiet night
with you and hope,
our family,
and I don't care if
their house is on fire.
For one night,
I will let it burn.
Just please, please come home.
Ok.
I'll meet you there.
Ok.
Go on.
How many days has it been?
Please go relax.
I'll be up shortly
with your next dose.
No, no.
Let's try to avoid
another episode.
No, no.
I will not relax
until Niklaus is buried alive.
We need to get back
the serratura
and lock them all
away in a pit of fire.
It's being taken
care of, darling.
Here. The sister
has been researching
the medallion since it's been
in the Mikaelsons' possession.
By end of day,
we'll have what is ours,
and we'll have taken care
of the only witch
willing to protect them.
Ugh.
I think I prefer
the bottom the murky sea
to that restroom.
Still hungry, are we?
I'm not hungry, I'm angry...
Staked your ex,
drowned by Nik's.
You two need a lesson in women.
Could the lesson not be
yours to learn, Rebekah?
Didn't you damn one
of them to eternity,
viciously antagonize the other?
Those lunatics actually
believe the prophecy.
You don't, do you?
You'd be foolish to ignore
the manifestation
of these omens.
We can't be killed, Elijah.
This prophecy does state one
of us will fall by family.
Well, I would never harm you,
you killed half the Navy
rescuing me,
Freya hates traitors.
Yes. Freya. Let's not forget
her allegiance to Finn.
I do want to trust her, but...
So that leaves Nik.
Do you think he's
learned his lesson
about backstabbing his family?
Oh, I think he learns
that lesson all the time.
He's just a terrible student.
Do you ever want to
just rip out his heart
and see how long
it takes to grow back?
Unh! Ohh.
What is it?
Marvelous.
What do you get the girl
who has everything this Christmas?
A cure to a magical mark
growing on her bloody arm.
I'll warn you...
I'm armed.
Aah! Aah!
Unh!
Unh!
Agh!
Will, you in there?
It's Cami.
I assume you called first.
I've been told turning up
at someone's home uninvited
could be considered rude.
Are you seriously following me?
Klaus, I don't need a bodyguard
or some white night
trying to protect me.
I'm here as your friend.
Vincent said he'd be home.
Shh, shh.
Yah!
Oh, my God! Will! No!
Camille!
Will: You shouldn't
have come here!
Will, it's gonna be ok.
Just drop the gun.
Insert empathetic
psychobabble here.
It's not ok!
Put the gun down!
Or what, you'll
save me the bullet?
I am the definition
of worthless!
I try and try to
make a difference,
but there are things lurking
out there in the shadows,
and... And in the face of them,
I am nothing.
Do you understand?
It's Lucien's compulsion.
Is there anything
you can do, Klaus? Please.
Invite me in.
Hey! I got your text.
What happened?
She got jumped.
like yuppies.
The Strix.
Yeah. She needs your blood.
You ok?
Kind of hard to
ignore it when someone
needs your help, huh?
They took it.
The serratura.
I was meeting with a witch
from the bloodline
who built the lock.
I was hoping she could
help me destroy it,
but it's not possible.
She said the only way
to get rid of it
is to use it.
We have to get it back
and lock something else away,
anything but my family.
Great. Why don't
we pay Tristan a visit
and ask him
really, really nicely?
I'm afraid we have
a far more urgent problem.
Well, to be fair,
I am the prettiest
urgent problem
you have ever seen.
Marcel: I opened
this gym for warriors.
You're not welcome anymore.
Excuse me.
Van Nguyen, the kid whose
mom went after Davina...
Family business got shut down.
He can't put food on
the table for his sisters.
Life's a bitch in the ninth.
What else is new?
Today, Tristan transferred
Tonight, Van will ascend
to the regency.
The leader of
the witches will be some kid
with a debt to The Strix.
Meanwhile, you're here,
fighting shadows.
Marcel, you got no idea
what I fight.
Wow.
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be a lot worse
when you have the blood
of your people on your hands,
all because you sat back
and let it happen.
Since when have you given
a damn about my people?
I'm New Orleans born and bred.
So are you.
Yeah, witches and vampires
have been fighting for power
since this city was a swamp,
but we are all New Orleans,
and now you're gonna hand
over 9 powerful covens
to some outsider!
Witch business ain't
your business.
I think you should back off.
Or what? You gonna get
another little teenage girl
to do your dirty work?
Hoo.
I have been holding back
my power for a long time.
Today that stops.
See, I came here for
a little bit of clarity,
and I think I just got that.
I'm gonna take back
the regency, Marcel,
but you ain't gonna like
what I'm gonna do with it.
While I cannot take away
the feelings of worthlessness
that haunt you now,
I can tell you
you will learn
to live with them.
I certainly have.
I have also come to find
that the very thing you
believe is worth the least
matters most of all.
There is beauty in the courage
of the fragile fighter,
those who persevere
despite all they've
been through,
those who still believe
there is good in the world.
Us dark things
often find we need
that light the most.
What you do not see in yourself
others see in you.
You do matter.
Have you a family?
Yeah, a sister.
Baton Rouge.
Go to her.
Enjoy Christmas.
In the new year,
you will return to your captain,
and he will welcome
you with open arms,
and, detective,
you will remember today
as your darkest day.
Tomorrow will be better,
the day after better still.
You will go on.
Give me the bad news, doc.
Freya: Aya's stake was cursed.
It infected you.
As this mark grows,
you will go mad.
Left unchecked, you will become
a relentless,
unstoppable ripper.
Aya always was thorough.
Strix always employ a safeguard.
In the event
that we were successful
at retrieving your body,
you were cursed.
You see, if one is on a rampage,
one is not difficult to hunt.
Can you fix this?
The spell is carved here.
I can... I can reverse it.
I just... Need some time
and a hell of a lot of magic.
Jackson: She was fine.
Hayley healed her.
This scratch is not healed.
This is poison.
This is an assassination
attempt.
She's waking up.
You ok?
I feel weak.
Jackson: Those vampires must
have stabbed her with something.
So The Strix are fond of
this slow-acting poison.
There is an antidote.
If I can get my hands on it.
For this, I'll need
a pure silver knife,
some white muskroot.
I'll get the knife.
I'll track down the root.
Freya, you can barely
float a feather right now,
let alone save the world.
I'll channel Finn.
Oh, lovely.
My fate rests in the hands
of our black sheep of a brother
that we have trapped
in a necklace.
I'm sure he's just
leaping to help.
Well, he's the only other
powerful witch here,
and you and I are out of options,
sister.
He's packing.
Klaus...
What you did...
Was nothing.
It was not nothing.
Elijah.
Finn: The pain you
endure for these monsters
you call family.
Finn.
It isn't worth it, sister.
It is.
It has to be.
The ingredients are complicated.
Klaus: I don't need the recipe.
I know exactly where I
can find the antidote.
I'll be quick.
If The Strix have been using
this poison for centuries,
then Lucien has a cure,
I guarantee it.
Probably keeps it tucked away
next to his cure
for werewolf bites.
I'm sure he won't mind if
we break in and borrow it.
You go.
I'll be fine.
No.
If I'm going to save my sisters,
I can't be worried about you.
Right now,
the safest place for you is with me.
Please.
Don't fret.
I haven't gone full hellion yet.
No more than usual.
Well, that's good.
I wouldn't want to
have to kick your ass
before I got to hug you.
You know, we need to talk
about your sartorial choices.
This is positively darling.
That is not mine.
That is Cami's.
She has been staying
here the past few nights.
Actually, Jackson and I
have our own place now,
although we still can't manage
to stay out of Mikaelson drama.
You don't seem to mind
the family drama
when you need something from us,
like a decent dress
or a babysitter.
Excuse me?
But when you're looking
for someone to blame
for your unhappiness,
we seem to be the enemy.
Rebekah, you're wrong.
This... This isn't you.
I am wrong.
I believed we were friends,
nearly sisters,
but the last time we spoke,
you were planning
on taking hope away
from this family forever,
so where do you stand, Hayley?
Are you a friend,
are you family,
or perhaps...
You've been a foe all along.
You are dying for her.
Let Rebekah go.
Let them all go.
Uh-uh.
It will just be
the two of us again.
I will save her.
If I am at all important
to you, brother, help me.
Freya, stop, please!
No! Don't touch me!
Do not stop me.
Listen to me.
We must help Rebekah,
but we must not lose
you in the process.
Help me or get out!
This will strengthen you.
As will my power
just this once, sister, for you.
Be honest. You want
Klaus dead, don't you?
Rebekah, I have been
busting my ass,
trying to fight this prophecy
at the expense of my own family.
Ha ha! You mean
that fake husband
you've been parading
around in front of Elijah?
Do you know the agony
it causes him?
Perhaps you like it,
knowing you still have
the power to break his heart.
Ugh! I can't do it.
I can't focus.
She's burning up. I guess
a hospital's out of the question.
A hospital won't help her.
You're wrong.
It kills me to hurt him.
Well, it hasn't yet, luv,
but it might today.
You tore my brothers apart.
If they turn on each other,
as the prophecy suggests,
it's because of you!
Where's Hayley?
You stay with her, please.
Raah!
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
Rebekah, look at me!
Rebekah!
Control yourself.
Dear brother, I have control.
Good.
Ha! Yaah!
Unh! Aah!
Klaus: Rebekah!
Not her.
Not her either!
Rebekah: Aah!
Rebekah: Dear, sweet Cami.
You're so afraid
that you'll ruin her,
you keep her behind glass
like some breakable object.
She's not precious.
Nik, every woman
that you and Elijah
bring into our lives
turns to poison.
She'll grow toxic, too.
Hyah!
I'm ok.
In her heart.
Did you get the muskroot?
Yeah.
No! No! Aah!
Freya: Hold her!
Well, that was annoying.
You ready to go?
Am I the world's worst mother
for letting
my teething toddler gnaw
on something that's been
around for a millennium?
Hope's tough.
I think she can take it.
Are you ok?
Oh, you never get used
to the feeling
of a fist around your heart.
I'm really sorry.
I know I promised
that we'd spend the night alone.
I even had this really dumb plan
that we were gonna
drink hot whiskeys
and watch "it's
a wonderful life" together,
yet here we are.
You don't need to apologize.
Today, it was me
that saw their house
on fire and decided
not to let it burn.
Why did you decide to help them
after everything?
Instinct.
I don't know.
I felt like one of my pack
was in danger, and I acted.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
My in-laws really suck...
But, hey, they fought like hell
to protect each other today,
and I respect that.
I was born to love you, Hayley,
and if that means I have to
deal with the Mikaelsons,
then ok.
I'm in.
If we leave now,
we could still catch
the end of "it's a wonderful
life" before her bedtime.
I got a better idea.
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas
Said you wanted
a happy family Christmas.
Well, the family's all here.
Elijah:
Merry Christmas, little one.
Next year, all...
Klaus: Thank you
for helping Freya.
Unfortunately, we're all
out of Mason jar moonshine.
Ha ha ha!
Rebekah: Well, Nik, you
are positively merry tonight.
All that therapy
must be paying off.
Oh, no.
Yes, I know it's not
exactly a bonfire,
but I improvised.
Come on. It's tradition.
Tradition?
We write our wishes
and then burn them for luck.
Strangely, I don't recall
wishing for an influx of enemies,
and yet year after year...
Elijah: How odd.
Forever on Santa's naughty list.
Merry Christmas
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Merry Christmas
One of us is still meant
to fall by family.
Right now,
what concerns me is our enemies.
They have the weapon
they intend to use against us.
They cannot know that we found you,
Rebekah.
Our best advantage is if
they believe you are lost at sea.
Then I can't stay, can I?
It's ok.
My wish already came true.
We have this moment.
Rather lonely place
to spend a holiday.
Have you no special
love to spend it with?
Oh. Right.
Don't tell me.
You planning on taking over
the gym, too?
Hardly. I can't stand churches.
I need your expertise, Marcel.
I've been informed
that our chosen regent,
the young Van Nguyen,
has been rejected
by the ancestors.
Rejected, huh?
Well, Nola witches
aren't easily manipulated,
especially the dead ones.
And yet there's a rather
dramatic ceremony happening
in the cemetery right now.
Someone is ascending to
the regency as we speak.
I assume you've had
your ear to the ground.
Who is it?
Uh, his name's Vincent Griffith.
Ah. The witch who was once
inhabited by Finn Mikaelson.
Yeah, that's him, and he isn't
gonna be so easily bought.
You have a merry Christmas now.
Woman:  we wish you
a merry Christmas...
We wish you
a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
And a happy new year
Rebekah, so soon.
Rebekah: Take care
of our brothers, Freya.
God knows they need it.
Bye, baby.
I'm so sorry about
what I said, Hayley.
It's fine.
You know, when I left last,
I thought for sure
you'd hate Klaus forever.
Oh, I will, but even
when you hate him...
You're always leaving.
And I always come back.
Run far and fast,
stay on the move,
and should you happen to
meet some handsome fool,
know your weaknesses.
Ha ha!
Well, perhaps it's time
our roles reversed.
I'll run away from love
if you run toward it.
Freya: 100 years
ago, I snuck into
a Christmas ball here.
I wanted so much
to be a part of it,
but I thought I was forever
fated to be an outsider,
always looking in.
I know this hasn't been
your most elegant family Christmas,
but, well, it's already been
the best one I've ever had.
I suppose some things
are worth the wait.
You look...
Don't say tired.
You've lived long enough
to know you should never tell
a woman she looks tired.
I was going to say
contemplative.
Ha.
A penny for your thoughts.
I was thinking about you
and what Rebekah said.
Is she right?
Do you see me
as this fragile thing
that needs to be kept behind glass
to protect me from Aurora...
Don't. Please.
When I think of all the ways
she could have hurt you...
She didn't.
Klaus, she didn't...
Because of you.
I've lost count
of the amount of times
you've been there for me
and everyone you care about,
but today, you saved someone
who doesn't mean a thing to you.
Why?
Because you wished it.
Because what's important to you
is important to me.
What makes you happy makes
me want to keep you so.
What scares you
I want to tear apart.
I do not wish to watch you
from behind glass, Camille.
What do you wish?
Heh.
No. No, no! Finn!
All right. Y'all wanted me.
You got me.
You got me,
and I ain't in the mood
for pomp and circumstance.
Our city is collapsing,
and I'm gonna need all
the guidance I can get.
Tristan: Congratulations,
Mr. Griffith.
The regent witch
of New Orleans...
How grand.
Let me guess...
Lord Tristan de Martel.
You know, I've always
despised churches,
but cemeteries I love.
Churches celebrate fairy tales,
guardian angels, patron saints,
but cemeteries hold
concrete proof
that not one of those things can
save you from the inevitable.
Yeah.
So your Strix vampires,
they've been watching me,
tailing me, listening to me,
so they know I'm not
an easy target,
and I'm sick and tired
of good people
falling victim to the trash
that The Originals
bring to town.
Now normal people can't
enforce justice on vampires,
but I will.
I can, and I will,
so...
You guys keep watching me,
but know for sure
I'm watching you, too.
That's very brave.
A vigilante witch
that fears no vampire?
Yeah.
Or so it seems,
but I know someone you do fear.
So if you don't do as I ask,
I'm certain Finn Mikaelson will.
Man:  dark days riding
on a stone cold heart
I got your message.
Break my will,
tear us apart
There's a lone
candle burning...
I was halfway to the airport
when I suddenly got the urge to
rip out my taxi
driver's jugular.
I only just resisted.
There's a calm to knowing when
your back's against the wall
No.
I'm afraid so.
Will you make your peace...
Freya can try something else.
What if we've run out of time?
I already went after Hayley.
Who's next...
Freya herself, hope?
And even if she can...
You don't want to run.
You know I always hated it.
Ya ooh...
Hide my body.
Don't tell a soul,
especially not Niklaus.
Let him be happy just for once.
This is our burden to bear,
yours and mine.
Ya ooh
And when the year
that the prophecy foretold is over,
have Freya work out
a cure, wake me up,
and throw me a hell of a party.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Maybe the only way to stop
this stupid prophecy is
to embrace it, control it.
If we can control it,
then maybe we can change it.
When I am buried,
the family part of the prophecy
will be over.
You will be over
to trust them again...
Freya, Hayley, Niklaus.
You can stop anyone,
friend or foe, that comes at you,
so do it, Elijah!
No.
- Do it!
- Shh, shh, shh.
These are dark days...
Elijah, do it!
Dark days
These are dark days
Dark days
Beautiful.
You should play more.
Oh, I never stop playing.
I compose whole sonatas
in my head, brother.
You had a good day
then, my love?
Mmm. Yes.
A beautiful day.
And here's to an even
better tomorrow.
Oh!
Ohh!
No, no, no.
No! No! No!
No!
