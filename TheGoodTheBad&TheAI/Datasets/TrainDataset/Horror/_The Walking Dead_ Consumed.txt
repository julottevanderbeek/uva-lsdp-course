Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...
Someone knows what you did at the prison.
They accepted.
You don't have to.
No, they do.
I owe you everything.
I sent you away and now we're joining you.
Will you have us?
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
They got Beth!
Come on, get in.
Go away!
Go away!
Hold those gates if I don't
make it out tonight...
-
-
So it was just
- Daryl:
-
We were out there for a while.
-
-
Daryl: Rick's gonna
wonder where we went.
Tank's runnin' low.
We can end this quick.
Just run him off the road.
Nah, we're good for a bit.
If they're holding her somewhere,
we can get it out of the driver.
Yeah, but if he don't talk,
we're back to square one.
Right now we got the advantage.
We'll see who they are.
If they're a group,
see what they can do.
And then we'll do what we
gotta do to get her back.
They're heading north,
I-85.
What the hell's he waiting for?
There's two of 'em.
Is that a cop?
They might've seen us.
Aw, shit!
Tank's tapped.
They'd have taken the
bypass and they didn't.
They must be holed up
in the city somewhere.
We gotta move, find someplace
to hole up till sunlight.
I know a place just a
couple of blocks from here.
We can make it.
-
-
- Two more.
- I almost got it.
Come on.
You used to work here
or something?
Something.
- Daryl: What's this place?
- It's temporary housing.
You came here?
I'll take the top bunk.
I think that one's
more your style.
You should sleep.
I'll take first watch.
- This is locked up pretty tight.
- I know.
Then we're good, then.
I'll keep first watch.
I don't mind.
Suit yourself.
You said we get to start over.
Did you?
I'm tryin'.
Why don't you say
what's really on your mind?
I don't think we get
to save people anymore.
Then why are you here?
I'm tryin'.
When we were out by the car...
what if I didn't show up?
I still don't know.
You don't have to.
You don't.
Thank you.
Daryl: That car was
headed downtown.
I say we get up
in one of the tall ones,
get ourselves a view,
see what we see.
We can stay close to the
buildings and keep quiet,
but sooner or later,
we're gonna be drawing 'em.
All right, we can get up there.
There's a bridge.
Some days, I don't know
what the hell to think.
Good thing we skipped breakfast.
How did we get here?
Mm-mm.
We just did.
You still haven't
asked me what happened.
After I met up
with Tyreese, the girls.
Yeah, I know what happened.
They ain't here.
It was worse than that.
The reason I said
we get to start over...
is because we gotta.
The way it was...
Yeah.
You see something?
I don't know.
Hand me that rifle.
Right there.
It's been there a while.
Definitely one of 'em.
It's definitely
some kind of lead.
We should fill up.
All right.
Hmm.
What?
I bet this cost some rich
prick a lot of money.
Looks like a dog sat in paint,
wiped its ass
all over the place.
Really?
I kinda like it.
Stop.
I'm serious.
You don't know me.
Yep, you keep
tellin' yourself that.
- Daryl, don't.
- Get up.
Hands up, both of you.
Lay down your crossbow.
You got some sack on you.
Look, nobody has to get hurt.
I just need weapons, that's it.
So, please, lay down
your crossbow.
Back up.
- Sorry about this.
-
You look tough.
You'll be all right.
Three bullets.
We're in the middle of a city.
He was stealing our weapons.
Did you think
I was gonna kill him?
I was aiming for his leg.
Could that have killed him?
Maybe, I don't know.
But he was stealing our weapons.
He's a damn kid.
Without weapons we could die.
Beth could die.
We'll find more weapons.
I don't want you to die.
I don't want Beth to die.
I don't want anybody
at the church to die,
but I can't stand around
and watch it happen either.
I can't.
That's why I left.
I just had to be somewhere else.
Well, you ain't somewhere
else; you're right here.
Tryin'.
Look, you're not who you
were and neither am I.
I don't know if I believe
in God anymore or heaven,
but if I'm going to hell,
I'm making damn sure
I'm holding it off
as long as I can.
All right, let's get this done.
It's not stable.
I'm lighter.
There's more coming.
We're gonna
have to fight through.
Yeah, I see 'em.
- We have to go.
- GMH, what's that? A hospital?
I don't know.
Grady Memorial, maybe?
Grady, the white crosses-- it
might be where they're holing up.
- Carol:
-
Daryl:
Anything we can use?
Nothin' but what we got.
Daryl:
All right, buckle up.
You hold on.
-
- We're okay.
We're okay.
God.
Ow.
Here.
I'm fine.
Prove it.
How bad is it?
I've had worse.
Damn, that was stupid.
We made good time down.
There's only three blocks
between us and Grady.
We need to find a place nearby,
scope it out,
see what we can see.
You really think we're gonna
find out what we need to know
just by watching?
It's where we start.
Come on.
It's them.
All right.
Let's see what we see.
You said I ain't like
how I was before?
Yeah.
How was I?
It's like you were a kid.
Now you're a man.
What about you?
Me and Sophia stayed at that
shelter for a day and a half
before I went
running back to Ed.
I went home, I got
beat up, life went on,
and I just kept praying
for something to happen.
But I didn't do anything.
Not a damn thing.
Who I was with him...
she got burned away.
And I was happy about that.
I mean, not happy, but...
And at the prison
I got to be who I always
thought I should be,
thought I should've been.
And then she got burned away.
Everything now just...
consumes you.
Well, hey...
we ain't ashes.
Is that yours?
Yeah.
-
-
Oh, God.
I'm good.
I'm good.
You go.
God.
-
-
Plea-- please.
I had to protect myself.
- Why you followin' us?
- I-I didn't, I swear! I thought you followed me.
Bullshit.
Noah: Come on, man.
Plea-- please!
- Please, please.
- Nah, I already helped you once.
It ain't happenin' again.
Have fun with Hoss over there.
Noah:
- Please! Please, please!
- Daryl. Daryl. Stop.
You almost died 'cause of him!
But I didn't.
Nah, let him be.
- Noah:
- Daryl!
Come on, just a little more.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Daryl:
You okay?
I'm still here.
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
They're gonna come.
They probably heard the shot.
If they find me...
- Who?
- Them, people at the hospital.
Wait, wait, wait, just tell us--
is there a blonde girl there?
- You see a blonde girl?
- Beth?
She helped me get out,
but she's still there.
They're coming.
We gotta go now. We gotta go.
We gotta go.
The building next door
has a basement.
It's clear.
We'll be safe.
Ah! Ah!
Daryl:
Go, I got him.
Come on, get up.
-
-
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!
- Let go of me!
- Wait! They can help her.
And then she can't get their help.
Is that what you want?
We can get her back.
We can get Beth back.
What's it gonna take?
A lot.
They got guns, people.
So do we.
