Shit. It's under.
He doesn't know that.
Yes!
G'day.
Get out of the vehicle.
No worries.
Know how fast you were going?
Faster than I was supposed to,
if you blokes pulled me up.
You shoot pigs for a living?
Bet your life.
Can you read?
Well, get a bit stuck
on the big words
every now and then, but you know.
Yeah, I can read pretty good.
Then you'd be able to
read the sign back there
with the big one-fuckin'-double-zero
on it, wouldn't you?
You know, I could've sworn I was,
you know, sittin' under 100 there.
You think I'm talking shit?
Struth no.
No, sorry, mate.
No, look, won't happen
again, alright?
Where the fuck you
think you're going?
You bastards. You're
putting me on, aren't you?
You're not really going
to book me, are you?
Can I see your licence, please?
Yeah.
You're a long way
from home, aren't ya?
Oh, yeah, look, always
travel up north
when I'm doing a bit
of hunting, you know.
Get away from it all.
Not a lot of pigs down south.
Ooh!
This, plus a speeding ticket.
It's an order to take
this car off the road
for good.
Tires are as bald as a baby's ass.
I'm amazed it's even running.
Body looks like you've thrown
it off a fuckin' cliff!
Come on.
Now you take this piece
of shit back to town,
and then you get the fuck
back where you came from.
I don't want to see your ugly
mug around here ever again.
You understand?
Or is that too many
big words for you?
Mate, you sure you
want to give me this?
Bet your life.
You have a nice day.
Ta!
Yo fuckin' asshole.
Oh, man.
That's how we keep our
quotas up out here, son.
'Oh, man. You sure you
want to give me this?'
Yeah. Pretty sure you just got
that rusted piece of shit
taken off the road, too.
Fuckin' dickhead.
Oh, man, did you see
the look on his face?
What a redneck moron.
Jesus! Fuck! Fuck!
Aaah! Fuck!
Shot!
Where the bloody hell do
you think you're going?
You're crazy, you are! You...
Not me leg. I think it's broken.
Hmm.
Oh, shut up, you big crybaby.
That'll do, pig.
What do you think
you're fuckin' doing?
You know, your little mate's right.
I am a pig shooter.
You know what I do to pigs
who won't stop squealing?
I make 'em stop!
Fuck me.
You stupid pair of bastards.
Look at the fuckin'
mess you made, huh?
Now, I gotta clean it up.
They'll fuckin' find us!
They'll find the fuckin'
car and then they'll...
Fuck.
I want to see my kids.
Aww.
Why?
Mate... Mate, wait.
I can make the ticket
go away, mate.
Or I can make you go away.
Bonsoir.
Bravo, bravo.
Hey!
Hello.
RUTGER: Cool.
Hey! Thank you!
Thank you.
MAN: Have a good trip.
Awesome.
They are so cute, I love them.
What are they called again?
The little black one's
called Nutella.
I know it's brown, but it was
my daughter's idea of a joke.
The little one with the
broken horn is called Casper.
And the other one, that's Marley.
- OK.
- KATARINA: Thank you so much.
- It's alright.
- Here we are.
Bye-bye, kids.
KATARINA: Oops.
- Thank you. Auf Wiedersehen.
- WOMAN: See ya. OK.
- See ya, love.
- RUTGER: Thank you very much.
So cool!
-
- Oops.
- Hello, and goodbye.
-
Alright, if you keep fighting,
you're gonna go back to the car.
Motherfucker!
What's wrong with you people?
You afraid to stop or something?
Yahtzee.
What the bloody hell are you
buggers doing out here?
This is a national park.
You can't camp here, mate.
Sorry, we did not know
that was the case.
About national parks, I mean.
No signs here.
Oh, well, don't get your
knickers in a knot, mate,
I'm not a ranger or anything.
Look at this bloody fire, mate.
You haven't put it out properly.
All this bloody saltbush around
here is dry as a nun's nasty.
You know, one spark, the whole
bloody place will go up!
Ah... I did put some water on it.
Yeah?
For all the good you've done,
you may as well have
pissed on it, eh?
It was a good thing
I found you, huh?
Name's Mick.
Rutger.
Rutger. Rutger! Eh!
Kraut, are ya?
I'm from Germany.
Yeah, they usually are.
OK.
Oh.
Heil, froo-lein.
Hi.
Little bit of German for you.
It's good. 'Fr√£ulein'.
As I was saying, mate, if
the rangers did find you,
you'd be charged, right? You
wouldn't want that, would you?
No.
As a matter of fact, mate,
I'm going back through town,
so I can give you a lift, OK?
You know, and set you up in a
caravan park for the night.
Right? Yeah?
You wouldn't want to be hiking
back into town, would you?
No, we were hoping to
get lift tomorrow.
Like I said, there's no signs here,
so did not think we were
doing anything wrong.
Well, I'm offering you a
lift, mate, you know.
So you won't get caught.
Are you sure there's no camping
here? I checked on the map.
I just said so, didn't I?
Well, yes, but... um...
Well, you calling me a liar?
Look, I'm gonna give you one
last chance to help you out.
Alright?
Thank you, but we will stay.
Sorry about the fire and for
making you come out of your way.
Don't you turn your back
on me, you Nazi bastard!
So, let me hear you talk
back now, you dopey cunt.
Rutger!
Rutger!
Rutger!
Rutger!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Oh, ho, ho!
-
-
Keep still. Keep still.
Keep fucking still!
Now put your hands together.
Put your fucking hands together,
or I'll spread your nose
all over your face.
Now, look, I didn't
want to do you here,
but your stupid fucking
boyfriend forced me.
And now, why wait, eh?
Anyways, my name's Mick Taylor.
Pleased to meet you.
I still don't know what
you friggin' tourists
see in this place.
I mean, is this the way you
spend your life, froo-lein?
Eh? Coming out here and
shitting in our backyard?
Is that what it's all about, eh?
Is it, eh?
I'm talking to you.
- Talking to you!
-
Oh, ho, ho!
- Look at that, eh?
-
Cookies!
Rutger!
Rutger!
Rutger, no!
- Hey?
-
Shit!
He's tougher than a pig.
Where you crawling
off to, froo-lein?
Now,
I promise you,
we're gonna spend a nice,
long, few months together.
There we go!
Non-smoker.
Gutless Kraut now, huh?
Rutger, what are you,
part bloody donkey? Eh?
Who's the lucky girl, then?
That'd make your eyes
water, wouldn't it?
Here's a little piggy,
here's his snout.
Slit him open and
his guts fall out.
Get your fucking head
out of the road.
All good gear.
The dogs'll like that.
Oh, you mongrel bastard.
Oh, Jesus.
- Come on!
-
Quickest way to a man's heart
is through his chest, eh?
Doesn't look fucking
easy getting through
that fucking breastplate, does it?
Can you fucking believe it?
There we are.
Oh, no. Rip your heart out.
There we go!
Hide-and-seek, is it?
Hey, come on, girly.
Fair up the arse.
Hey, hey.
Hey, you have to run
faster than that.
-
- Clever bitch, eh?
- Beck?
- BECK, ON PHONE:
- Becky!
-
- Hello, Angel?
-
- I...
-
..can't hear you, babe.
I, um...
Becky.
Bollocks.
-
- Holy shit!
Help me!
- Help...
- Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What happened?
- Did you get hit?
-
What? It's alright. Come on!
We're gonna get you
out of here, alright?
-
- It's alright.
-
- Alright.
Alright.
Hey, is there anyone else?
Is there anyone...
-
- Who did this shit to you?
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on!
- Alright.
-
I don't understand you!
Who's this fucking maggot?
- I don't...
-
- Alright!
-
Who was that? Who was that?
What the fuck is going on here?
- Fuck!
-
Arrrgh!
You'll have to do better
than that, arsehole!
-
- Oh, Gott. Mein Gott.
-
- Hey!
- Oh, shit! It's alright!
-
Hey, little pigs, little pigs!
-
- Let me come in!
It's alright!
Come on, you fucker!
Fuckin' hell! Fuck!
Hold on!
-
- Oh, God!
It's alright. Hang on.
It's alright!
See you in hell, cunt!
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah! Oh, shit!
Are you alright?
Oh, shit!
Fuck!
For fuck's sake, Mick!
No! Ah!
Fuck!
I'm so...
I'm sorry.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
Uh...
Hey!
-
- Oh, shit!
What the fuck's wrong
with you, you pricks?
Stop, you fucking bastards!
OK.
OK.
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
- Hey! Hey!
-
PAUL: Hey!
Fuck me.
Oh, shit.
Thanks for the truck, blubber guts.
Let's play, eh?
Come on!
Oops!
Bit of music, eh?
Near the village,
the peaceful village
Wheee-eee-eee-eee
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh
Whee, oh, wimoweh
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh
Rrrrr, ahh-ahh-ahh
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh
Whee, oh, wimoweh
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh...
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit.
Oi!
Shit! Flying kangaroo!
Oh! Sorry, Skippy.
Hey!
Welcome to Australia, cocksucker.
Come on.
Aaaaaaah!
Aaaaaah!
Come on!
Hmm!
Ohhhh!
Oh, shit!
You'll have to do better than that!
MICK: Little pigs! Hey, little pigs!
Let me come in!
MAN:
He's got to be hungry, I know that.
We didn't know whether to wake you.
We'll head into town as soon
as you've eaten something.
Phone?
No phones.
We got short wave
if it was working.
It's the magnets.
Something weird in the ground.
Even the TV goes on the
blink now and again.
You got to be
self-sufficient out here.
It's alright.
You're safe now.
I'm Lil.
This is Jack.
Paul.
Come on, son. Eat up.
You'll need your strength.
I made it special for you.
MICK: You in there, hero?
You don't want anyone else
to get hurt, do you, eh?
He's here.
Don't you worry, mate.
I'll see to it.
Get off my property.
Hey, mate. The boy.
Hand him over.
I said get the hell away from here!
Now get.
He's gone.
No. No, he's...
He's not.
He will be if I see him again.
The car's at the front.
We'll all go out together.
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I can't.
Shit.
Ohh!
Hey, baby.
We could have had a
good time, you and me.
Please!
Just... just leave me alone.
Fucking Pommy, eh?
Definitely a Pommy.
Weak as piss.
MICK: Obviously don't know the
first rule of the outback, hero!
You never, ever stop.
Could have saved yourself
a whole lot of trouble.
Why are you here, Pommy?
MICK: I asked you a question.
- Why are you here?
- Please...
I didn't... I didn't
mean to interfere.
I... I should have
just left her there
and minded my own business.
MICK: Well, maybe I can
answer it for you, huh?
You're here for an adventure.
You're here for a bit
of excitement. Hmm?
- For the thrill, hey? Hey?
- Yes. Yes! Yes!
- Something a bit different!
- Please.
Please! Just... just...
just let me out of here.
And I'll just walk away.
That's a good one.
You expect to come to
my fucking country,
waltz around like you
own the bloody place,
come between a man and his meal
and 'just walk away, ' eh?
Just like that?
Please! Don't!
You owe me, boy.
What made you think you could
just take her away from me, huh?
- I just...
- Hey? Hey, hey, hey?
Where's your famous
English wit now?
-
- Hmm?
Be even harder to be a smart-arse
with no fucking tongue.
There once was a lad from York,
who picked his nose with a fork.
And when it got stuck, he
cried, 'I don't give a fuck, '
and walked around
looking like a dork.
There once was a man from Kansas,
whose nuts were made of brass.
In stormy weather,
he'd clack them together,
and lightning would
shoot out his arse.
What are you doing, Pom? Hmm?
There once was an old
lady from Wheeling,
who had a peculiar feeling.
She lied on her back,
and tickled her crack,
and pissed all over the ceiling.
'Pissed all over the ceiling.'
You're a funny little
fuck, aren't ya, eh?
English wit, mate.
Where'd you learn those?
Boarding school.
Boarding school, huh?
Pants-down, botty-whackers, eh?
Only on weekends.
You still know fuck
all about my country,
eh, you little Pommy ponce?
There once was an
Australian stockman,
lying, dying.
And he got up on one elbow
and he turned to his mates
who had all gathered around
and he said...
'Watch me wallabies feed, mate.'
All together now!
All together now!
He lives somewhere
out on the track, Mac
- BOTH: All together now!
Keep playing 'til I
shoot through, Blue
- PAUL: All together...
So we tanned his hide
when he died, Clyde
And that's it hanging on the shed!
Hey!
- Oh, yeah!
-
Fuck me.
You mad little British bastard.
Yeah. Well, you know...
Where do you know that song from?
Um... My mother had the record.
We'd listen to it
endlessly as kids.
My word, eh?
You are a knowledgeable
little prick, eh?
I'll tell you what, mate.
Let's have a fucking drink, eh?
I thought you'd never
fucking ask, man.
'I thought you'd
never fucking ask.'
-
- There you go, old son.
Let's wrap the laughing
gear around this one, eh?
Oh, thanks.
I don't really have a free hand.
Thanks for mentioning that.
I would never have thought.
There we go.
- Thank you.
- OK.
- Get that in, son.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
Here's looking up ya bum.
Alright.
Phwoar!
Alright, isn't it?
Tastes like camel's
piss but, Jesus,
it gives a man a fuckin' buzz.
Rum. It's all me and my mates
used to drink back home.
Yeah? Rum, eh?
Here's a good one.
My name is old Jack Palmer
I once dug for gold
The song I'm 'bout to sing ya
Recalls days of old
As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum
BOTH:  The old keg of rum,
the old keg of rum
As we all sat together
round the old keg of rum.
With golden soil and...
wealth for toil
I hate that fucking song.
'Girt by sea.' Who's Gert?
-
- Some fucking big butch lesbian
standing astride Sydney
fucking Heads or something.
- It's a fucking shit song.
-
Oh, shit.
Now, seeing as you're such
an amusing fucking Einstein
know-it-all bastard,
I got this little game we can play.
- Kinda like a quiz. Yeah.
- Right.
I call it Aussie History.
I ask you ten questions, you get
half of 'em right, so, five,
and then I'll let you go.
Does that sound alright to you?
That's... That sounds
fucking brilliant.
Beauty.
Sorry. I didn't get
your name, mate.
Oh. Mick Taylor's the name.
Pig-shooter and general
fuckin' outback legend.
Right. Cheers.
- You ready to rock 'n' roll?
- Yeah.
What's that for, Mick?
Oh, I forgot to mention.
For each one that you get wrong,
I get to grind off a finger.
-
- Ten questions, ten fingers.
Kind of fitting, you
know what I mean?
Of course.
So it's sort of like Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire?
Except you don't get to phone
a friend if you get one wrong
because you'll be too busy
screaming in fucking agony!
Alright.
Let's rock 'n' roll then.
Alright. We'll start
off with an easy one.
What Aboriginal term
meaning 'waterhole'
is also the name
of an Australian surf
clothing company?
Billabong.
- Very good.
-
- Next one's a bit harder.
- Right.
But you're a stinkin' Pom,
so you'll be alright.
In what year did the British
settle in Australia?
Well, um...
After Lieutenant James Cook
discovered the east coast
and mapped it in 1770,
the First Fleet arrived
and settled on
Does that answer your question?
Jesus! You are a smart cunt.
I might have to let you
go on that answer alone.
Where'd you learn all that shit?
Majoring in history? That's a
fucking coincidence, isn't it?
But I am a man of my word,
and either way, you
know, I did say 10...
Blah, blah, blah. Here we go.
OK.
Rightio.
In what year did the British
start deporting
convicts to Australia?
The first 11 ships of the First
Fleet arrived with their cargo
of around 780 British convicts
in Botany Bay, New South Wales.
And a further two convict fleets
arrived in 1790 and 1791.
The first free settlers
arrived in 1793.
Mick?
Mick?
That's right. Isn't it?
I know it is.
Why?
I'm not really sure I
understand the question.
Why did the British deport
convicts to Australia?
Why? Um...
Uh...
Come on, you dumb fuck!
Time waits for no man.
- No, no, no!
- Tick, tock, tick, tock...
First... first... first of all,
after the British lost
the 13 colonies -
they'd lost their penal
settlements in Virginia
in the United States.
And they needed somewhere
to put all the criminals
that were stacking up in England.
There were just too
many of these people,
and they were just spreading
disease and wasting resources.
-
- And, second of all, they...
Australia looked to be
as rich in resources
as the Americas.
And obviously the British
wanted to settle this
before the French
did, or the Dutch.
Something like that?
Mick, no. What the fuck, man?
That's right!
What are you doing? Mick! Fuck!
That's the right fucking answer!
What do you want me to fucking...
Fuck! Mick, that's right!
-
- Fuck!
That's the right
fucking answer, Mick!
Jesus Christ! No!
I got two right. Come on!
You don't need to fucking do this!
I got them all right.
-
- It's the right fucking answer!
It was fucking right!
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was the right...
- No, it wasn't.
-
The right answer is
because they are a
pack of Pommy cunts!
No, seriously, you're
right, technically.
And that gives me the shits.
Come on. Calm down. Calm down.
Jesus Christ, you're going
on like a big girl.
It fucking hurts!
Knock those tears off.
Knock 'em off, you bloody sook.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Jesus H. Christ, boy.
You alright? You alright?
Yeah.
Right? Alright?
Alright?
Just one more quick one.
An easy one and then I'll
get us another drink.
And you can be on your way. Eh?
You're doing real well, mate.
You're doing real well.
Cheers.
Now, who's Australia's
most famous cricketer?
And not Shane fucking Warne.
Come on.
Come on.
I don't know anything
about fucking cricket.
Can you ask me a football question?
You don't have to
know about cricket
to know who this bloke is.
Just give me a clue.
Well, he's the greatest
cricketer of all time.
The Muhammad Ali of
fucking cricket!
Oh, shit. Come on, Paul.
It's on the tip of
my fucking tongue!
This'll be on the tip of
your tongue in a minute!
No, no, no!
What kind of a bloody
idiot you take me for?
What letter does it
fucking start with?
'D'. Duh!
Doh. Duh!
- Douglas Jardine.
- Fucking Pommy, you idiot.
Dennis...
- Dennis Lillee.
- Not fucking Dennis Lillee.
- It's Dennis fucking Lillee.
- It's not.
A famous cricketer
that starts with 'D'.
It's not fucking
Dennis fucking Lillee!
What the fuck is it
then if it's not...
Fuck this! Fuck you!
No, no, no! Please! Please!
Jesus Christ, the other hand!
MICK: Eh?
Use the fucking other hand, Mick!
Oh. Is that your
wanking hand, is it?
-
- Oh, well, please yourself.
Mick, it's Dennis fucking Lillee!
- No, it's fucking not.
- Dennis fucking Lillee! Please!
Please! Please! Mick! Mick! Mick!
-
- It's Dennis Lillee...
Give me that fucking hand
or I'll knock your fucking teeth
right down your fucking throat.
You understand me? Eh, eh?
Fuck! Oh, fuck!
-
- Oh, no!
-
- Ah!
Please... just let me out of here.
Of course I am going to let
you out of there, mate.
You've been a real good sport.
But first I'm going to grab
us another drink. Alright?
- You're going to let me go now?
-
Yeah, of course I will.
Yeah, I'm going to
let you out of here
and then I'm going to
take you somewhere else.
- Down there.
- No!
'Cause you see, no-one
really gets out of here.
Well, not in one piece, you know.
- Figuratively speaking.
-
That would just be crazy.
What the fuck is this?
You said you were a
man of your word.
I am. I am, mate.
As I said, you owe me, boy.
You took away my plaything.
And so, you're just going to
have to stand in for a bit.
Okey-dokey?
No. You're not some
fucking faggot freak!
You...
Don't you ever fucking say that!
Don't you ever say that!
Hey!
This will turn you into a woman.
I didn't mean it like that.
I didn't mean it like... that.
Hey, Mick.
It's Don Bradman, bitch.
You'll have to do better than that,
you Pommy cunt!
Oi! That really bloody hurt!
I think you cracked me skull!
I got claret coming out
of me bloody scone
all over the place!
There's blood everywhere!
I hope you're happy
with yourself, mate!
I reckon by now you would
have found the dead end.
People have been dying
to get out of here.
Fuck!
The summer's gone and all
the flowers are dying.
PAUL:
You've got to be fucking joking.
MICK: Here comes Uncle Mick!
Make it stop! Please!
Please, don't leave me!
I'll come back! I'll come back!
Please!
WOMAN: Help me!
Now, about all them bodies.
They deserved it.
All of 'em.
Foreign bastards!
Noxious bloody weeds.
Ohh!
Somebody's gotta keep
Australia beautiful!
Fuck!
MICK:
We're having such a good time.
Singing, and drinking,
and carrying on.
Tie me kangaroo down
Tie me...
Ah, fuck ya!
Come on! Come on!
Get out of here! Get him! Go on,
get away up there. Get on him!
- No!
MICK: Come on, mate.
Where do you think you're going?
I told ya, there's
no way out of here.
What the fuck?
I smell the blood
of a stinkin' Pom!
Bit rough, ain't it?
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You see, in this world,
there's people like me and
there's people like you.
And people like me eat people
like you for breakfast
and shit 'em out.
You're nothing but foreign vermin.
A stinking introduced species.
And it's up to my kind
to wipe your kind out.
And that makes me the winner.
Which makes you...
What's going on?
You got to help me.
You got to help me.
