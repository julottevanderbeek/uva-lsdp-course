Last season on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
Dad!
I owe a debt to a man I met.
What's stopping you?
The walkie-talkie, the one
in the bag I dropped.
You told me that he died!
We're heading to the CDC.
If there's anything left,
it's gotta be there, don't you think?
Where is everybody?
I'm all that's left.
- I love you.
- Please!
- No, I'm staying!
- I'm staying too.
Andrea, no!
They're coming.
Get down!
Rick:
It's all about
slim chances now.
I tried to do everything right,
keep people safe.
I tried, Morgan.
Our group's smaller now.
We lost another,
day before last.
It was her choice.
The CDC was a dead end.
I met a man there,
a scientist.
He told me something.
He told me...
It doesn't matter.
What matters
is we're moving on.
Atlanta's done.
We're gonna try
for Fort Benning.
Son, let's saddle up.
Rick:
Stay off the road.
Keep moving.
Keep your eyes open.
I don't know, just--
just be safe.
Maybe we'll see you
in Fort Benning someday.
Rick signing off.

Just thinking about our trip
to the Grand Canyon with Carl.
I don't remember that.
No, you wouldn't.
You were just a baby.
Besides, we never made it
past Fort Worth.
No, you got sick.
I never knew a baby could throw up so much.
Carl:
Yeah, ick.
The doctor in Texas
said you'd live.
Then we turned around
and drove home.
Carl:
No, it was a good trip.
The best.
Can we go see it?
The Grand Canyon?
I'd like to.
Sophia:
Can we go?
We'd never go without
you and your mom.
That's a promise.
Looks complicated.
The trick is getting
all these pieces
back together the same way.
I could clean yours,
show you how.
Oh yeah.
It's a sweet piece.
It was a gift
from my father.
He gave it to me just before Amy
and I took off on our road trip.
He said two girls on their own
should be able
to defend themselves.
Smart man, your father.
Look, it's a--
it's a limited capacity.
See? Only holds
seven rounds.
Dale:
See a way through?
Uh, maybe we should
just go back.
- There's an interstate bypass--
- We can't spare the fuel.
Jeez.
I said it.
Didn't I say it?
A thousand times.
Dead in the water.
Problem, Dale?
Just a small matter of being
stuck in the middle of nowhere
with no hope of--
Okay, that was dumb.
If you can't find
a radiator hose here...
There's a whole bunch
of stuff we can find.
I can siphon more fuel
from these cars for a start.
- Maybe some water.
- Or food.
This is a graveyard.
I don't know how
I feel about this.
All right, all right,
here we go.
T-Dog: Come on, y'all.
Just look around,
Kids, don't look.
- Which one?
- The flathead.
Radiator hose clamp
is always a flathead.
Here, you do it.
Learn something.
Ed never let me wear
nice things like this.
We're gonna need clothes.
Hey, Carl.
Always within my sight, okay?
You too, Sophia.
It's all good.
Okay.
All right.
Glenn.
It's like being baptized, man.
Oh, Christ.
Lori, under the cars.
Carl, Sophia, get down now.
- Carl and Sophia. Sophia.
- Shh shh. Get under.
Ow.
What?
Shh.
Oh!
Okay.
-
-
Shit.
-
-
Shh.
-
-
Lori.
- There's two walkers are after my baby.
- Shh shh.
-
- Shh shh!
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Shoot them!
No. No!
Those walkers on the road
would hear it.
Then it wouldn't be just two,
it'd be hundreds.
Come here.
Come on.
All right, just hold here.
You stay there.
Wait.
Come on.
Sophia, you have
to do exactly as I say.
Hide in there.
Squeeze in tight.
- I'll draw them away from you.
- No no, don't leave me.
Listen listen listen listen.
They don't get winded.
I do.
I can only deal
with them one at a time.
I wouldn't be able
to protect you.
This is how we both survive.
You understand?
Okay?
Go go go go.
If I don't make it back,
run back to the highway,
back to the others
straight the way we came.
Keep the sun
on your left shoulder.
Come on!
You ugly son of a bitch.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Sure this is the spot?
I left her right here.
I drew the walkers way off
in that direction up the creek.
Without a paddle--
seems where we've landed.
She was gone by the time
I got back here.
I figured she just took off
and ran back to the group.
I told her go that way
and keep the sun
on her left shoulder.
Hey, short round, why don't
you step off to one side?
Assuming she knows
her left from her right.
Shane, she understood me fine.
Shane:
She had her a close call
with two walkers.
Got to wonder how much
of what you said stuck.
Got clear prints right here.
She did like you said,
headed back to the highway.
- Let's spread out, make our way back.
-
Hey, we gonna find her.
She'll be tuckered out
hiding in a bush somewhere.
She was doing just fine
till right here.
All she had to do
was keep going.
She veered off that way.
Glenn:
Why would she do that?
Maybe she saw something that
spooked her, made her run off.
A walker?
I don't see
any other footprints.
Just hers.
So what do we do?
All of us press on?
No, better if you and Glenn
get back up to the highway.
People are gonna
start panicking.
But most of all,
keep everybody calm.
I'll keep 'em
busy scavenging cars.
Think up a few other chores.
I'll keep 'em occupied.
Come on.
Why aren't we all out there looking?
Why are we moving cars?
We have to clear enough
room so I can get the R.V.
turned around as soon
as it's running.
Now that we have fuel
we can double back
to a bypass that Glenn
flagged on the map.
Going back's going to be easier than
trying to get through this mess.
We're not going anywhere
till my daughter gets back.
Hey, that goes without saying.
Rick and Daryl,
they're on it, okay?
- Just a matter of time.
- Can't be soon enough for me.
I'm still freaked out from
that herd that passed us by,
- or whatever you'd call it.
- Yeah, what was that?
All of them just
marching along like that.
A herd.
That sounds about right.
Okay.
Come on, people.
We still got a lot to do.
Let's stay on it.
Let's go, come on.
Tracks are gone.
No, they're faint,
but they ain't gone.
She came through here.
How can you tell?
I don't see anything.
Dirt, grass.
You want a lesson in tracking
or you want to find that girl
and get our ass off
that interstate?
- Shane.
- Carl, what happened?
I found something cool.
Shane, check it out.
It's an arsenal.
That's cool, bud.
Go give 'em to Dale.
Check this one out.
Whoa, it's a hatchet.
- Be careful. Don't play with those.
- They're really sharp.
- What did I just say?
- Can I keep one?
- Are you crazy?
- No way.
Shane. Shane, tell her
to let me keep one.
Hey, man, go give them
all to Dale now. Go.
- What was that?
- What was what?
The way you blew him off just now.
You crushed him.
I don't believe you.
You're giving me the cold shoulder?
Isn't that what you want?
Aren't you the one who said stay
the hell away from him and you?
You forget what happened
at the CDC?
Your little meltdown in the
rec room slip your mind?
- When you tried--
- When I tried to what?
What do you think that was?
I think it is pretty plain
what that was.
A mistake.
One that I admit to.
I have a few mistakes
under my belt, Lori.
So do you.
No debate there.
But Shane, we need
to stop this.
Why do you think
I'm prepping my new ride?
I'm leaving.
Leaving?
As in gone for good.
Gonna quietly slip away
first chance I get.
Radio:
-
- Is that a local signal?
It's got to be within
-
- Asshole.
Okay, let's get back to work.
-
-
Sophia!
What are you looking for?
Skin under the fingernails.
It fed recently.
There's flesh
caught in its teeth.
Yeah, what kind of flesh?
Only one way to know for sure.
Here, I'll do it.
How many kills you skin
and gut in your life?
Anyway, mine is sharper.
Now comes the bad part.
Yeah, Hoss had a big meal
not long ago.
I feel it in there.
- Here's the gut bag.
- I got this.
This gross bastard had himself
a woodchuck for lunch.
At least we know.
At least we know.
It's late.
Gonna be dark soon.
They'll find her.
Where's my gun?
You have no right to take it.
You don't need that
just now, do you?
My father gave it to me.
It's mine.
I can hold onto it for you.
Or you can give it back to me.
Everything cool?
No, I want my gun back.
I don't think
it's a good idea right now.
Why not?
I'm not comfortable with it.
The truth is,
less guns we have floating
around camp the better.
You turning over your weapon?
No.
But I'm trained in its use.
That's what the rest of y'all
need is proper training.
But until that time I think it's best
if Dale keeps them all accounted for.
Uh-huh.
Mind telling me
what that's about?
Oh God, they're back.
You didn't find her?
Her trail went cold.
We'll pick it up again
at first light.
You can't leave my daughter
out there on her own
Out in the dark's no good.
We'd just be tripping over ourselves.
More people get lost.
But she's 12.
She can't be out there on her own.
- You didn't find anything?
- I know this is hard.
But I'm asking you
not to panic.
We know she was out there.
And we tracked her for a while.
We have to make this
an organized effort.
I've asked him to oversee this.
Is that blood?
- We took down a walker.
- Walker? Oh my God.
There was no sign it was
ever anywhere near Sophia.
Andrea:
How can you know that?
We cut the son of a
bitch open, made sure.
Oh God.
How could you just leave her
out there to begin with?
How could you just leave her?
Those two walkers were on us.
I had to draw them off.
It was her best chance.
Sounds like he didn't
have a choice, Carol.
How was she supposed to
find her way back on her own?
She's just a child.
She's just a child.
It was my only option.
The only choice I could make.
I'm sure nobody doubts that.
My little girl got left
in the woods.
Everybody takes a weapon.
These aren't the kind
of weapons we need.
- What about the guns?
- We've been over that.
Daryl, Rick and I are carrying.
We can't have people popping off
rounds every time a tree rustles.
It's not the trees
I'm worried about.
Say somebody fires
at the wrong moment,
a herd happens
to be passing by.
See, then it's game over
for all of us.
So you need to get over it.
Daryl:
Chances are
she'll be by the creek.
It's her only landmark.
Stay quiet and stay sharp.
Keep space between you but always
stay within sight of each other.
Shane:
Everybody assemble your packs.
Keep on those repairs.
We've got to get
this R.V. ready to move.
We won't stay here a minute
longer than we have to.
Good luck out there.
Bring Sophia back.
Keep an eye on Carl
while we're gone.
I'm going with you.
You need people, right?
To cover as much ground as possible.
Your call.
I can't always be the bad guy.
Well, he has all of you
to look after him.
I'd say he's in good hands.
Okay.
Okay.
But always within our sight,
no exceptions.
Andrea, I'm begging you.
Don't put me in this position.
I'm not going out
there without my gun.
I'll even say please.
I'm doing this for you.
No, Dale, you're doing
it for you.
You need to stop.
What do you think's gonna happen?
I'm gonna stick it in my mouth and pull
the trigger the moment you hand it to me?
Dale:
But if I hadn't
done what I did,
you'd be dead now.
Jenner gave us an option.
I chose to stay.
- You chose suicide.
- So what's that to you? You barely know me.
- I know Amy's death devastated you.
- Keep her out of this.
This is not about Amy.
This is about us.
who the hell are you
to tell me otherwise?
To force my hand like that?
- I saved your life.
- No, Dale.
I saved yours.
You forced that on me.
I didn't want
your blood on my hands
and that is the only reason
I left that building.
What did you expect?
What, I'd have some kind of epiphany?
Some life-affirming
catharsis?
Maybe just a little gratitude.
Gratitude?
I wanted to die my way,
not torn apart
by drooling freaks.
That was my choice.
You took that
away from me, Dale.
- But--
- But you know better?
All I wanted after my sister
died was to get out
of this endless horrific
nightmare we live every day.
I wasn't hurting anyone else.
You took my choice away, Dale.
And you expect gratitude?
I don't know what to say.
I'm not your little girl.
I'm not your wife.
And I am sure as hell not your problem.
That's all there is to say.
Shane, look.
Dad said I could carry it and
mom said as long as I was--
Keep it down.
We're looking for Sophia.
You need to focus on the task.
- Got to keep up.
- I am.
- You okay?
- I think Shane's mad at me.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.
No, honey, I promise you.
He's just--he's worried about
Sophia, that's all.
Come on.
Shane:
She could be in there.
Could be a whole bunch
of things in there.
Carol.
If she's in there, yours is the
first voice she should hear.
Sophia, sweetie,
Sophia.
We're all here, baby.
It's mommy.
Daryl?
It ain't her.
- What's in there?
-
Did what Jenner said.
Opted out.
Ain't that what he called it?
What direction?
I think that way.
I'm pretty sure.
Damn, it's hard
to tell out here.
If we heard them,
maybe Sophia did too.
Someone's ringing those bells,
maybe calling others.
Or signaling they found her.
She could be ringing
them herself.
T-Dog:
What if they come
back with Sophia
and Rick wants to
move on right away?
- I had it fixed yesterday.
- What?
What was all that rubbing
and sanding for then?
- That just bullshit?
- Yeah, that's one word.
Another word
would be pantomime--
just for show.
No one else needs to know that.
Pantomime.
If the others know
we're mobile,
they'll want to mobilize
and move on.
So you don't think they're
gonna find Sophia, that it?
I'm just guarding
against the worst.
Sooner or later,
if she's not found,
people will start doing math.
I want to hold off
the needs-of-the-many-
versus-the-needs-of-the-few
arguments as long as I can.
That is one tricky hose, huh?
Very.
That can't be it.
Got no steeple, no bells.
Rick.
Sophia!
Yo, J.C.,
you taking requests?
I'm telling you, it's the wrong church.
It's got no steeple, Rick.
There's no steeple.
A timer.
It's on a timer.
I'm gonna go back in for a bit.
Lori:
Shane:
I think it is.
What made you decide?
Gotta back away.
Just trying to be the good guy here, Lori,
even if you don't see it.
None of this was intended.
I hope you know that.
Well, don't matter.
As long as I said it.
You're just gonna disappear?
You're not even gonna tell Rick?
He'd only try to stop me.
No, that's on you.
You tell him what you want.
Or tell him nothing at all.
- You're his wife.
- And Carl? We dragged him into this.
- I love Carl.
- He thinks you hate him.
I'm trying to put some distance.
I'm trying to make this easier.
This ain't easy on any
of us, least of all me.
I'm the one who loses you.
Father, forgive me.
I don't deserve your mercy.
I prayed for safe passage
from Atlanta and you provided.
I prayed for Ed to be punished
for laying his hands on me
and for looking
at his own daughter
with whatever sickness
was growing in his soul.
I prayed you'd put
a stop to it,
She's so fearful.
She's so young in her way.
She hasn't had a chance.
Praying for Ed's death
was a sin.
Please, don't let this
be my punishment.
alive and safe.
Please, lord.
Punish me however you want,
but show mercy on her.
I'm coming with you.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
I'm not stupid
and I'm certainly not deaf.
- Look, I don't know the story.
- There is no story.
Fine, I don't care.
Don't confuse me with someone who does.
Look, all I care about
is getting out of here
as far away as I can, like you.
We're gonna sail off into the sunset together?
We gonna hold hands?
I'm not asking you to go steady, Shane.
I'm asking for a ride,
a chance to start over
somewhere else.
I have. I see two people
who don't belong.
We're the odd men out.
Between the two of us,
we make a great third wheel.
So what? Say we do,
we just run off.
What's in it for me except for
the extra ass I got to cover?
The chance to do something
for someone else.
- Yeah.
-
Put a gun in my hand,
I'll cover your ass too.
Think it over.
Got to move here, man.
These people are spent.
There's only so many
hours of daylight left.
- We still got a long way back.
- I can't stop yet.
We still got
a lot of ground to cover,
whole other side
of the Creek Bed.
So we search that
on the way back.
She would have heard those church bells.
She could be nearby.
- She could be a lot of things.
- I can't go back.
Her being out here is my fault.
That's great.
Now they got you
doubting yourself, huh?
What about you?
You doubt me?
Hey, we can assign
all kinds of blame.
This means something,
finding her.
Oh man.
It would be the miracle we need.
We can't give up.
Mmm.
Ahem.
Y'all gonna follow the Creek Bed back, okay?
Daryl, you're in charge.
search this area another hour
or so just to be thorough.
You're splitting us up.
You sure?
Yeah, we'll catch up to you.
Carl:
I'm her friend.
- Just be careful, okay?
- I will.
When did you start growing up?
Rick:
Here, take this.
Remember how to use it?
I'm not taking your gun
and leaving you unarmed.
Here, got a spare.
Take it.
- Give me a minute?
- Yeah.
Come on.
I don't know if you're
looking at me with what?
Sadness?
Scorn?
Pity?
Maybe it's just indifference.
I guess you already know
I'm not much of a believer.
I guess I just chose to
put my faith elsewhere.
My family, mostly.
My friends.
My job.
The thing is, we--
I could use a little something
to help keep us going.
Some kind of...
acknowledgment.
Some indication I'm doing
the right thing.
You don't know
how hard that is to know.
Well, maybe you do.
Hey look, I don't need
all the answers.
Just a little nudge.
A sign.
Any sign will do.
- Get what you needed?
- Guess I'll find out.
Carol:
So this is it?
This the whole plan?
Daryl: I guess the plan
is to whittle us down
into smaller
and smaller groups.
Carrying knives
and pointy sticks.
I see you have a gun.
Why, you want it?
Here, take it.
I'm sick of the looks
you're giving me.
All of you.
Honey, I can't imagine
what you're going through.
And I would do
anything to stop it.
But you have got to stop
blaming Rick.
It is in your face
every time you look at him.
When Sophia ran he didn't
hesitate, did he?
Not for a second.
I don't know that any of us would
have gone after her the way he did
or that anybody could have
done it any differently.
Anybody?
Y'all look to him and then you
blame him when he's not perfect.
If you think you can do this
without him, go right ahead.
Nobody is stopping you.
We should keep moving.
Shane.
Oh no.
No.
No, no, no, no!
