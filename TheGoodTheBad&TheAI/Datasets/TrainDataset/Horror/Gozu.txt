Hello! Hello!
Brother, Boss is here.
Welcome.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.
Let's start.
Now, if anyone has any news
to report, please do so.
Anything?
Haven't you got any?
Since there seems to be no news...
Hey, the chick you were with the
other day, with those huge...
No, no...
- Did you do her?
No, no.
My, my... you stupid fool!
If no one has any announcement,
let me proceed with updates.
What?
What I'm about to tell you is all a
joke, so please don't take it seriously.
Did you see the dog outside?
The dog?
The dog.
Please don't stare.
That must be a yakuza dog trained
to only attack only yakuza.
A yakuza dog?
A yakuza dog.
That?
We all need to be careful.
No one seems to have any
announcement to make...
So let's move on to greetings from Boss.
Yeah, well, I really don't have
a lot to say this month but...
Boss!
Gotta kill it before it kills us.
The Great Yakuza Horror Theatre
GOZU
Are we there yet?
Just a little longer.
Did Boss tell you anything?
About what?
About this trip to Nagoya to see clients.
Isn't it strange?
To have me visit clients at such a time?
Um, can I go take a leak? Excuse me.
Minami.
Yes.
What do you think of our family?
I think it's a good family.
Our family will continue to
decline if this keeps up...
As long as Boss is in charge.
It will be fine as long as we
have you, Brother Ozaki.
All Boss cares about now is the woman.
It's hopeless when one falls
for a woman at that age.
I'm planning to ask him to retire.
Depending on how it goes, I
might kill him and get killed.
Will you put your trust in me
and stick with me to the end?
Brother, I've been ready for this
since when you saved my life.
I'll stick with you to the end no matter what.
Bad news...
Stop the car!
Minami, get out! Get out!
Yes!
Down! Down!
Wh... what is it?
That's a yakuza car designed
to... run over yakuza.
Brother, it doesn't look like
anything but a regular car.
Plus, there's no such thing as a yakuza car.
Minami...
If anything happens to me,
please take care of my things.
Die.
Brother!
Go now.
Go now!
Brother... Brother!
Yes, it's Minami.
Where are you?
Just before Nagoya.
You're late. And Ozaki?
He's asleep.
That's convenient. Hurry on.
You aren't still hesitating, are you?
I'm telling you Ozaki is crazy.
Hurry and take him to the
disposal site in Nagoya.
Understood?
Understood.
Brother...
Brother? Brother?
Well, it's more cold today.
It was warmer yesterday.
It's definitely colder today!
What, you don't believe me...
you stupid idiot!
I said it's cold!
Hold on! It's going to beep, so let me
put in another coin. Hold on a second.
Welcome.
Yeah, sure it was super hot
until the day before yesterday...
Coffee.
...I was walkin' 'round in short sleeves.
You don't believe me?
Everyone agrees.
It was hot, right?
Look, everyone says yeah...
Walkin' 'round in short sleeves.
You don't believe me?
Everyone agrees.
It was hot, right?
Look, everyone says yeah...
Here you are.
I only ordered coffee.
It's on the house.
Enjoy.
What?
You're not from Nagoya, are you?
Not from Nagoya, are you?
Not from Nagoya?
Not from Nagoya, are you?
Hey!
It was hot, he goes.
I go it was.
I go it was hot, and he goes ''Spot''.
He said that?
Doesn't make sense at all!
What a strange one!
Really. Strange, you know.
Then it goes ''beep'', I go
I'm running out of coins...
Excuse me, did someone come in?
Who do you mean by someone?
Someone came in while I
was in the bathroom, right?
Did anyone just come in?
Well...
- Did someone?
No. We don't know, right?
Did someone?
- Well, ready to go?
I don't understand what
you're saying, you idiot!
You killed Ozaki for sure, right?
Then there's no way dead Ozaki goes
anywhere by himself, is there? Idiot.
What're we gonna do if he's alive?
He even wants to take my life!
Anyhow, just find his dead body or whatever
and bring it to the yakuza disposal site!
Understood?
Ouch!
The ladle's rubbing against me. Ouch!
It hurts, hurts!! Ouch!
Are you near Nagoya now?
Yes. Close.
There's someone I know who's headed a
family for a long time called Shiroyama Group.
That's the ''Shi-ro-ya-ma'' Group.
Go to him. He might help you.
Sure, the address is around here.
But I've never heard of the Shiroyama Group.
I was told they lived here for a long time.
Then they may have gone somewhere else.
But... you mean if they've gone somewhere...
Why don't you ask the police?
That's your best bet.
What is it?
What is it?
Where's the Shiroyama Group located?
Shiroyama Group?
What's the address?
This address is where Shin-ho Farm is.
What?
But... the man at the temple
said he didn't know where.
You're not from Nagoya, are you?
Tokyo?
Yokohama?
I'm from Hong Kong.
What does the Shiroyama Group do?
Thanks but I'll find it myself.
Out of the range...
It's a bone.
It was a bone as I suspected, a bone.
You got a flat tire.
Need a hand?
Does my face bother you?
Stare at it all you want. I hate it
when people pretend it's not there.
I was born with a pigment
defect just around here.
Is it creepy?
Not really...
My factory carries lots of tires.
I'm sure there's one that fits your car.
We all need to help one another, you know.
Can you sing ''Yosaku''?
No.
Have you ever killed a man?
No.
I see.
I bet you eat curry over rice and hashed
meat over rice together, don't you?
No.
Hey, your grandma's name is Kiriko, right?
It's Keiko.
Keiko...
Wait a minute... hey, what're
you trying to find out?
Well, I thought we're much alike, you and me.
Shiro... yama... Group...
Hmm, that man named Mr.
Azamawari doesn't quite ring a bell.
Hey, do you know him?
No, I don't know him.
Your ''brother'' that disappeared, is
he someone that important to you?
Yes.
Then I might lend you a helping hand.
We all need to help one another, you know.
On one condition, however.
If you can answer the question I'm about
to ask, I'll help you find your brother.
But if you can't answer, I won't help you,
plus I'll take something important to you.
I got no money if that's what you mean.
Is money what's important to you?
My life?
That's not what I want.
I'm just gonna take something
that's extremely important to you.
Do you wanna give it a shot?
I do.
Alright.
Then here's the question.
What passes by, though it's not moving?
I'll give you 30 seconds.
You skipped some. Hey, you skipped! Skipped!
I didn't skip.
That's not...not enough time like this!
Wait... Time!
It's time that passes by!
...0.
You got it!
Congratulations!
As promised, I'll help you find your brother.
No'se, help him.
- Yes, I will.
He knows this area... at least most of it.
Thank you.
The sun's going down soon so we'll
commence our investigation tomorrow.
No, that won't work. I'm in a hurry.
We're the ones helping you out and
we expect you to go by our schedule.
If you don't like it, please
go ahead on your own.
Haste makes waste.
Masakazu Inn
Let's go.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!!
Hello?
Welcome.
I'm sorry, I was digging up
some lotus root in the field.
Need a room?
Is there a vacancy?
A double room?
Single, please.
There's only one small room available.
You're okay with that,
right? That's fine, please.
Kazuo!! A guest.
Rustic cuisine or seasonal
Masakazu Inn
Show him to the room.
Which room?
That room!
Please come in.
Well, thank you for everything today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
No, I'll be fine.
Well, I need to see what kind of room it is.
I'm concerned.
Would you like dinner?
Yes, please.
Well...
Let me consult the owner.
It's a pretty good room.
Yeah.
I could stay here, too...
Do you mind?
Well, you'll see me tomorrow.
Aren't you cold-hearted.
After I did so much for you.
I...I do appreciate it.
I just can't sleep well with
somebody else in the room.
I won't do anything weird to you.
Well...
That's not the issue...
I really can't?
I'm sorry...
I see.
I'll go home.
That's what you want, right?
Who do you think you are? Idiot.
Did your friend leave?
Yes.
Are you having a meal?
Oh, if you don't serve food,
I can go outside to eat.
Oh no, we can prepare it.
We just don't have many ingredients today.
Normally, we can prepare Course A, but
we can only prepare Course B today.
Is that alright with you?
That Course B is fine.
Yes, we'll prepare it then.
Oh, sir, it'll be a while before
the dinner will be ready.
Would you like to take a bath first?
Then I'll do that.
Oh, it's down the hall to
the end and you turn left.
Well, we have this beautiful gum tree, and...
How's the water temperature?
It's fine.
I see.
What is it?
Shall I scrub your back?
No thanks.
Really?
No, it's okay! I can do it myself!
Lately, I've been getting many
guests who turns me down like that.
Please hand me your towel.
It's okay.
You don't have to hide yourself.
That's a big one you've got.
Aren't my breasts big?
What?
I still got milk, too.
Would you like to drink it?
- Huh?
No, of course, I won't drink that!
Lately I've been getting so many
guests who turns me down like that.
Here.
I don't want it.
Go ahead.
I said I don't want it!
It's just a joke.
The dinner is... is ready!
See you later.
Excuse me.
Hey, this here, why did you give me so much?
It's free service.
Even for free service...
No, wait...it's okay.
I can do it myself.
Excuse me.
Hey, Minami!
Did your phimosis operation go well?
Yes, it went okay.
Let me see it.
Huh? Oh, it's not much to see.
I said let me see it.
No, really...
Let me see it or I'll fuckin' kill you!
Okay...
Wait, just a second.
Here.
Oh, so that's what it looks like.
I guess.
- It looks like Frankenstein's dick, doesn't it?
But your cock's still great. Really impressive.
Well... Brother, can I...cover it now?
Yeah. So you can fuck women, at last. Right?
Yes.
I've got a gift for you.
What's this?
Women's undies.
Thank you.
Give them to the woman you wanna fuck.
Yes.
They're a good-luck charm, so you'll do fine.
They're Givenchy crotchless-panties.
Oh, thank you.
- That's quality stuff, so use them well.
It's Givenchy, you know.
- Yes, yes, I got it.
Alright? Don't you throw them away.
- I won't throw them away.
You let her wear them and fuck her in them.
In them?
- Fuck her with them on.
Fuck her with them on?
'Cause there's a hole in them.
Use them well.
- Got it. I'll use them well. Thanks.
We selected Course A for your breakfast.
Good morning.
What happened to you?
Can't you see? I got injured.
I had a feeling something bad
was gonna happen yesterday.
That's why I didn't wanna
go home. It's all your fault.
I've got some tires for you, so
first let's go and change your tire.
When we're done with the
tires, where shall we go?
I see the coffee shop re-opened.
They'd gone out of business
and was abandoned before.
I see they re-opened.
Welcome.
They were here yesterday, too.
They look suspicious, don't they?
Ready to order?
Coffee. No custard, please.
Coffee for me, too. With custard.
Yes.
They might know something.
Don't know. I asked them yesterday
but they just kind of dodged me.
Let me go ask.
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
Aren't you little No'se from West junior high?
What?
It's little No'se! It sure is!
- What?
What do you mean ''what?'',
you're little No'se!
It's little No'se!
Well, well, I recognized you right away!
Little No'se, have a seat!
It's been a long time...
- ...Little Komatsu and Little Shiro?
What on earth are you doing here?
- It's been a long time.
To run into you guys here...
Have a cup to drink with us.
- Oh, I ordered something over there...
That's alright, don't be shy.
Hey, bring...bring something for him over here!
You're sitting over there?
Oh, let us have Little No'se
for a little while, okay?
It's been a long time.
What happened to your head?
- I fell again.
Falling again. You were falling all
the time since you were little!
I can't move well since I fell.
- A disaster with this one!
Oh, you've got a cane.
I can barely get up and walk.
- Hey, come on, don't get up!
Let me ask you again about yesterday.
Who's this?
He's an acquaintance of sorts...
Yesterday while I was in the bathroom,
did you see another customer come in?
Do you remember anything?
No.
I can't understand a thing
about what you're saying.
I was here yesterday, right?
About what time?
You know I was here around noon.
I don't remember too well.
I remember even if you don't.
You're conspiring against me,
aren't you? Right? Conspiring.
You're tired.
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?
You're tired.
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?
Mr. Minami, hold on! Mr. Minami!
If you assault me like that,
I won't stay quiet, either!
Hold up!
I won't stay quiet!
Let's go, No'se.
Well, please go by yourself if you want.
What the hell are you saying?
You should hire an investigator
if you want to look for someone.
I never had any desire to help you anyway.
It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?
It was cold.
It was hot the day before, wasn't it?
- It was hot.
You wore short sleeves, didn't you?
- I did.
You see. I told you...
Wait out there. No'se
So you're looking for someone.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
And has there been any clue?
None.
I'm sorry.
Well, Mr. Minami...
Have you heard of psychics?
Yeah, something like ESP, right?
Well, I guess there's something in common.
Actually, my brother Kazu over there
has always had this mysterious power.
He's a medium.
Did you say...a medium?
Yes.
He lets the spirit possess his body, and
the spirit speaks words through him.
The spirit may have an idea about the
whereabouts of the man you're looking for.
Would you like to ask?
Can he really do it?
I think it's worth trying.
Well, then...
So you're brother and sister...
Thanks for waiting.
Then, let's proceed.
Kazu, take your shirt off.
What?
You've always done this.
Come on, hurry up, take it off.
The candy drop, the candy here.
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up and take it off.
Now, we'll invoke the spirit.
Please repeat this in your mind:
''De'an keru kemista amore. ''
What?
Can you read that once?
De'an keru kemista...amore.
Ah! That's fine!
Now let's begin. Kazu, are you ready?
Spirit, decend!
Spirit, appear!
Ouch! It hurts!
Spirit, appear!
It hurts, sister!
How's that? Has the spirit come down?
No such thing will ever appear!
Come down!
It hurts!
Please, please help me!
What...can you have the spirit appear?
No, I can't do that!
Get up!
Wait...your brother says he's not a medium!
Whether he can do it or not...is not the issue!
...She's crazy...
Even if he can't, managing to deliver somehow
is the spirit of service and motto of our inn!
There!
It hurts!
- You...
It hurts, sister!
Wait...
Mr. No'se.
Mr. Minami...
I'm scared...
...scared.
- What? What?
You saw the two at the coffee
shop, in silver and in gold.
Yes.
They were the gang leaders from junior high.
I was so scared I couldn't
say no. Please forgive me.
Well, I understand now. I see.
I'm scared, Mr. Minami.
I'm scared... scared...
Don't be so scared. You're an adult now, okay?
It's not that.
Not that...well, what do you mean?
You know ... the manager
... of the coffee shop.
Yes, at the shop back there, right?
He's been dead.
He died three years ago, in a car accident.
How come the dead guy's here?
You're asking the wrong person.
By the way, I've got breaking news.
Those two saw someone
who might be your brother.
Is that true?
You went to the bathroom, right?
While you were there, a man of about 40
wandered in, asking where to get sticky rice.
Sticky...rice?
The two told him he should
go to a rice shop for rice...
...and gave him the address for
the nearest rice shop. Here it is.
Sticky rice?
Yeah, I seem to remember someone
looking for that yesterday.
Did he look something like this?
Something like that.
Something like that.
What did he do after he bought sticky rice?
He asked if I carried sesame
seeds or azuki beans.
Sesame and azuki?
Unfortunately I'd run out of them...
But I told him perhaps they might
carry them at a liquor store.
Did he go to a liquor store?
Probably.
Which liquor store?
I told him about the closest
liquor store around here.
Where is it?
Are you...going to the store?
I think so.
I advise against it.
Why's that?
The wife of the store owner... is an American!
Is it bad if she's an American?
Of course it is!
The store's always only carried Japanese sake.
And it's hopeless 'cause the owner's wife
is now more Japanese than a Japanese!
'Cause an American selling
Japanese sake is wrong, isn't it!
Can you give me the address of the store?
Do you like Americans?
I haven't seen him. Have you seen him?
Though I am not totally cer-tain, a man whom
I suspect is the person you de-scribed...
...ur, visited the store in the
evening and did indeed in-quire...
...to ask a question to query, ''Have you
got sesame seeds and azuki beans?''
Oh, so he came.
That's when I was out playing pachinko, was it?
Yes, just when you were out doing
pachinko, the customer visited and...
...he bought, ur, sesame and azukoo.
So, do you know where he went?
I do.
If you know, just tell them.
I'm sorry.
The man said to me to in-quire, ''Is
there a cheap inn around here?''
So I offered to tell him about the
inn that I happened to know about.
Which inn is it?
It's called Ma-sa-ka-zu inn, run by two siblings.
Thank you for coming!
Oh, it's you.
Have you found the man you were looking for?
Did you receive another customer
other than me last night?
Did you?
You don't have to yell.
Kazu...
What time was that about?
About...1 o'clock...at night, I think.
He was here?
It was so late...
...so I refused him at first...
...but he said anywhere would do...
...so I ended up showing
him to the storage upstairs.
Room upstairs, you mean, over there?
It's the room right above yours.
Those who deliver milk are
healthier than those who drink it.
Brother...
It's his smell.
Where did he go?
He seems to have left early in
the morning. Without paying.
We didn't know what to do, so we took his...
...sticky rice, sesame seeds and azuki beans...
...that he had left and made some red rice.
Can I sleep in this room tonight?
This isn't a room for guests.
The room you stayed in last night is
available, so why stay in a room like this?
'Cause my brother might come back.
We'll charge you the regular rate, is that okay?
Brother...
Brother?
''I'll wait for you at the disposal site. Ozaki.''
Brother!
Hello!
Brother?
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!!
Brother!
Who do you want to dispose?
Didn't this man come here yesterday or today?
He did.
Really?
Who do you want to dispose?
He was lying on the ground at the doorway.
On the ground...
Someone brought him here, I guess.
Where's that man now?
He's dead.
Who do you want to dispose?
We pressed him.
Did you kill my brother, you bastard?
Probably.
Put that away.
What was inside is in here.
Who do you want to dispose?
What patterns did he wear?
Oh, here it is.
It's pretty good.
This is your Brother.
This one right here!
It took you long enough.
I waited for you a long time, Mr Minami.
Who...?
I'm Ozaki, your brother.
Did you find this place right away?
Who the hell are you?
You don't believe me, do you?
How can I? My brother's a man, you know!
''Did your phimosis operation go well, Minami?''
''Let me see it.''
''Oh, so that's what it looks like
after a phimosis operation.''
''Looks like the Frankenstein's
cock, doesn't it?''
''But your thing is always large
and fine. Very impressive.''
How's that?
What do you think of my outfit?
Doesn't look good, does it?
- What?
I'll go and change, so please
wait for a little while.
Wait a minute!
What is it?
Are you surprised because I became pretty?
Stop it already. Who the hell are you?
You still don't believe me.
Of course, I can't!
What can I do to make you believe me?
How about...
You are still a virgin.
You used a picture of mating dogs
the first time you masturbated.
You get the urge from time to time
to shave all your pubic hair off.
How do you know all those things?
You told me all those things.
Brother Ozaki is the only person I told them to.
I'm telling you, I am Ozaki.
Brother's been disposed of properly.
Sorry for troubling your mind.
There's just one small problem that arose...
No, Brother's been disposed fine.
Yes... Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
Can I explain when I get back to the office?
Yes. I'll be back by tomorrow morning.
So long.
Bastard!
You still wanna do it?
Alright! Alright!
What are you doing going with that man!?
'Cause he asked me.
Aren't you my brother!?
Sorry about this hotel.
I apologize.
I don't mind.
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.
So, please rest...well.
Wouldn't you like to sleep with me here?
I'm fine. I'll sleep here.
Is that so.
I'll turn out the light.
Good night.
Trying to do something nasty?
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Wanna do something nasty?
Please excuse me.
If you feel like doing nasty,
you can wake me anytime.
Thanks.
About last night... please forgive me.
I was waiting, thinking you'd come to me.
Brother...
I'm gonna report to the office first.
But I think it'll be a problem if you're with me.
So please rest at a hotel or some place today.
I'm coming with you to the office.
I'd like to say hello to Boss.
Well, I don't get it.
Do you?
No.
You?
- No.
You don't make any sense at all, you know.
I understand if you don't.
I still can't believe it myself. But...
But that woman is definitely brother.
What?
You wanna end up in the disposal site yourself?
If you keep talking nonsense like that, you will.
But it's true!
Is this the office of the Azamawari Group?
Not yet!
- Who are you?
I'm Sakiko, the daughter of Torada who
was under your boss' wing a long time ago.
I'm Azamawari.
Who did you say it was?
My name is Sakiko, the
daughter of Ushikichi Torada.
Ushikichi Torada...
Does that ring a bell?
Come have a seat.
Torakichi Ushida, is it?
It's Ushikichi Torada.
My father always said you had helped him
a lot, all the time, when he was alive.
When he was alive?
He died of cancer last month.
I see.
I'm very sorry...I see.
Oh, I got it!
He was the type of man who'd fight
against anyone for justice, wasn't he?
Exactly.
Ah, Tora! It's Tora.
I used to look after him way back when.
I see, I see, so you're Tora's daughter.
Actually, I came to ask you a favor.
A favor?
Could you please find me a job?
A job?
- Actually, I'd like to work here.
Here?
What are you thinking?
Sakiko.
- Yes.
Well, I'd like to sort out some paperwork
at home immediately. Can you help me?
Yes, my pleasure.
Hey!
-Yeah!
What are you doing?
- Tell him to go to the square.
Have a good day!
There's no need to worry.
I'll take care of everything
for you from now on.
So don't worry about a thing.
Is that true?
It is true.
Do you want to take a shower?
Which smell would you prefer, soap or me?
You, of course!
Just a moment! Let me get ready.
I can't get it up without this.
Ouch!
It's coming, coming, coming!
Oops, I was about to come too soon.
Help!
What's that?
-Help me!
What? Minami!
What are you doing?
- Help me! Hurry!
What the hell are you doing, Minami?
I won't give my brother to anyone!
What are you saying, you stupid punk!
Get up!
Minami...
Brother...
Please take this.
What is this?
Givenchy crotchless panties.
A gift from my brother.
But I want you to have it, brother.
Thank you. I will use them carefully.
That's great!
Come.
Put it inside me.
It's wonderful.
Are you sure about this?
It's alright.
Leave it to your brother...
I'm already like this.
Right here...
You can come inside...
Come in deeper. Deeper...
I might break you, brother.
I'm fine. I beg you, deeper...
Deeper, please!
I came...

No animals were harmed while subtitling this film.
We do not condone violence on animals in any way.
But we do condone violence towards scum like Ichi

Scotty-Doo!
