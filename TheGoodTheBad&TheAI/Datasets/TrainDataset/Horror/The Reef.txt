- Hi, glad to see you.
- Me too.
- Are you okay?
- Super.
Luke, that's my girlfriend, Suzie.
Pleased to meet you.
You know my sister, Kate.
- You look fit.
- Thanks.
- I take it.
- Thanks.
Way.
You bought a car!
No.
I was the ready
against travel to Indonesia.
We prevent you from working?
Good.
It's great to be paid
to navigate around.
Go see Wazza.
The type scruffy on a yacht.
- Okay.
- At any hour.
- How are you?
- Good.
- And you?
- Okay.
- I have stuff to make you come?
- Okay.
- Lou is there?
- Yes, back.
Lou?
I'm coming.
- Impressive, eh?
- Yes.
A mako, tiger shark,
a hammerhead shark.
And a great white shark.
- It is from where?
- By.
- Here?
- Yes.
The white shark is rarely
also north.
No worries.
The shark attacks are rare.
Kate, that's Warren.
Hello.
- Are you okay?
- Good.
- Welcome aboard.
- Not bad.
A little messy but that's okay.
I show you the berths.
It brought back memories.
That's yours.
I brought you something.
I wonder what it is.
Thank you.
I've missed you.
- Sorry.
- It's nothing.
- You have someone else?
- No, that's not it ...
You wanted to take a break.
Matt wanted me to come.
The idea appealed to me.
So it's a holiday?
Yes, that's right, vacation.
Okay. That's good.
I must go up.
We will follow the tide.
Okay.
You just catch it?
Yes, there are plenty here.
Cool.
- Are you in Sydney?
- Yes.
My brother and his girlfriend
come from London.
- You go in Indonesia?
- Yes.
- You work with Luke?
- No, I am a fisherman.
That is changing.
You already support.
How do you know?
He told me about you.
We sailed
in the Mediterranean together.
That's it, it starts.
- Where are we going?
- To Cygnet.
It will be this afternoon.
Awesome. How is it?
You'll see.
It is.
Have fun!
Over.
Sorry.
Okay?
Yes.
Follow me.
- So?
- Great.
- It's your favorite spot?
- I never came.
- We explore a little?
- Okay.
I found this.
Magnificent.
What?
I know.
It's purely sexual?
I know.
You know what I think?
You're afraid.
Fear?
What?
Me.
You.
Us.
No, not you.
What then?
I dunno.
I know!
Just enjoy the moment.
- That's what I think.
- I do not care what you think.
Warren beckons.
The tide quickly.
It touches the bottom.
Kate, you cast an eye?
The boat sank.
- We will be stuck.
- The water recedes quickly.
The engine will not start.
- It works?
- No.
- And there?
- Nothing.
Must weigh anchor.
Kate, you hoist the sail?
The way is clear.
We went out of business.
Thank you, guys.
Wazza, will see the engine.
- Katie, you want the bar?
- Okay.
Go straight.
That's all right.
Who wants to try?
Suze?
Me?
Come.
This is an opportunity.
Two hands.
Good.
You maneuvers.
I wanted to see the sun rise.
It is superb.
I'm sorry for yesterday.
Yeah.
Me too.
It's complicated.
Yes.
You have no doubts?
If full.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
- You hungry?
- I'm hungry.
- Buffet breakfast '?
- Please.
Matt! Warren!
Okay?
Go out, poured.
Where is Matt?
Mattie? Warren?
Okay?
Go out, I'll get Matt.
Get out.
Follow me.
Breathe deeply.
Where is Matt?
Here!
I'm here.
It stuck.
Matt here.
- Okay.
- Follow me.
- You okay?
- Yes.
Okay?
Out of the water.
Okay.
Must be pushed.
Climbs.
Who's next?
You hold me?
Monte.
- Okay, Suze?
- Yes.
Damn.
Look.
The hull is torn.
Okay?
- What happened?
- I know.
It hit something.
A reef. A whale.
The boat is finished.
We should not stop there.
Because of the current.
It moves us away from shore.
The boat is finished.
It will not float long.
When it will sink,
we will even further.
- It will not sink.
- There was no EPIRB?
- What is it?
- The distress beacon.
It is old.
No plane will capture
the signal.
How do you know?
You saw planes go?
I speak not to join
the continent.
An island will do.
No.
- What are you doing?
- I orient myself with the sun.
It uses the dial.
The North is there.
There.
It's here.
Turtle Island is here.
We will not go straight
due to a reef here.
Going north
the course will lead us to the island.
We must swim on what distance?
Good luck.
I know this corner.
Not go into the water.
You think it's safer here?
We do not know what he has in the water.
I intend to discuss it.
Not go into the water.
Yes, there may be
sharks.
I dunno.
But there
of land there.
The longer you stay, the more it recedes.
Can swim
to save our skin.
While we are a force.
Or stay here
and hope does not sink.
Count on for help.
They must come quickly.
Or we die dehydrated.
I swim too well,
I do not do it.
Me either.
Okay.
Very good.
I'll find something
help us.
A helping hand?
I'll pass what I think.
Okay?
Yes.
We saw something.
There.
- What?
- I dunno, it was big.
Well, gotta find the EPIRB.
At least one large shark,
do not tell me.
At right away.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
You know the trigger?
Good.
Super.
Try this.
- For you.
- Thanks.
What?
It's like a seal.
Sharks love it.
If you want to come,
it looks at you.
But does not frighten the others.
We should wait.
As you see.
Look, it's a difficult decision.
Was unlikely to be found.
The boat will sink.
Very soon.
There is an island.
We should go.
I'm going with Luke.
Me too.
This is for you.
Want. Take that.
And for you.
I'm not.
I stay here.
It's better than staying.
Go on an island
you can not see?
Okay.
This is for you.
Thank you.
Are you sure?
Okay.
We will send relief.
- Okay.
- Ira?
See you soon.
See you soon.
- See you there.
- Okay.
What are you doing?
He knows the ocean
better than all of us.
Come with us.
I can not.
I really can not.
Goodbye, Sis.
Let's go.
- Sleep on it.
- Promised not worry.
Okay?
Well, it is grouped.
It promises to be lengthy.
We must find our rhythm.
And we will succeed.
Afterwards we can relax.
It will deserve.
Let's go.
Listen!
- You make too many waves.
- Did you see anything?
No.
Wait!
I come with you!
Come with us.
No.
Are you sure?
C'mon, that's okay.
It's crazy.
- I hope you're right.
- You're not alone.
Do not worry, we will get there.
We will succeed.
Take that.
- You sure?
- Yes, we share that.
Thank you.
We all tired.
Let us focus on our goal.
Imagine a luxury yacht
waiting for us on the island.
Or that I find my bed.
I always my last resort.
What?
When I'm at the gym,
I'm trying to beat the pain
I guess I make love.
You think about kissing
when you lift free weights?
Not only to kiss.
Also the preliminaries.
I forget them?
It is not common.
Stop!
The not listen!
What's that?
What?
What's this?
I see nothing.
It must be a school of fish.
- What are they doing?
- I know.
Continue.
Come on.
What is it?
It looks like a shell.
- A turtle's shell.
- You're right.
A turtle?
Are we here.
Come on, Suze.
We can not stay there.
Come.
No question of extending the legs.
I can not.
I understand.
Listen.
We must go.
I'll stay behind you.
Okay?
I stay near you.
You okay?
It was huge.
You amaze me!
What is it?
What?
I saw something there.
I see nothing.
You make me mad scared.
What has he?
- There is something.
- We gotta go.
- Something is following us.
- We are in the ocean.
It teems with life
but we must go.
We need to go.
Go.
Here we go. All is well.
There!
- Listen ...
- I saw a big thing!
- What do you see?
- I know!
Look.
I see nothing.
There.
- Did you see anything?
- Possibly.
I told you so!
- A shark?
- I know.
Continue to advance.
It's a shark.
- Major?
- Yes.
Remain grouped.
I see it.
Stay together.
You see?
He had to leave.
I see more.
Let's go.
Must go there.
This way.
Good.
I see more.
He's gone.
It's gone.
Calm down.
It's over.
You must stay calm.
Calm down. All is well.
Breathe with me.
Breathe.
It's right, left,
you fear nothing.
Breathes well.
It's good like that.
There he is!
Go!
He ate my leg!
Go!
Understood?
I lost a leg.
You understand?
You have to leave.
Go.
Swim, I'm done.
You have to leave.
I'll be fine.
- He'll be back!
- Look at me.
Soon he will return.
Come on, wake up.
I beg you, wake up!
Wake up! Pity!
Not stop there!
I love you ...
Come!
Come on.
Advance.
You said something?
You said something?
He'll be back, eh?
Is not it?
You said that there would
in three hours.
What next?
It is in the middle of the ocean!
At night!
We should not have to listen to you.
We should have stayed with Warren.
Now Matt is dead!
And soon we!
It is damn!
Completely fucked!
I'm sorry for Matt.
And sorry for everything.
Luke is not your fault.
You're there for nothing!
We chose to come.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
What was that?
Regroup.
I want to die. Pity!
Save us!
Look.
Look.
Be careful.
It is very sharp.
It's good to get out of the water.
Turtle Island is not.
But it's mainland.
Leave.
I hurt everywhere.
Me too.
What?
I know.
Stand back.
It's a dolphin!
It is moving fast.
The current must carry us.
The current helps us finally.
This is the dolphin?
Damn ...
It's good, come on.
Lord ...
Poor Suzie.
This is the same, eh?
I think so.
That's him.
There is another reef.
We should go.
Go!
Come.
- Let's go.
- I can not ...
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
My foot is bleeding.
Shit.
Sorry.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
I love you, Luke.
Me too, I love you.
Ready?
No.
Me either.
Let's go.
Swim!
Hurry!
Climb!
Go!
Hurry!
I can not do!
Shoot!
Hoisted me!
Back me!
Shoot!
Come back!
I beg you!
