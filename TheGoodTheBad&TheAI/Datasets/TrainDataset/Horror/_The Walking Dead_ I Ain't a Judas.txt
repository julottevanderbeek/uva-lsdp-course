The Walking Dead...
Get out! Please!
We're going. Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.
Go!
How much longer do you need?
I don't know.
One time that
son of--
- Rick: We're not leaving.
- Hershel: We can't stay here.
What if there's another sniper?
A wood pallet won't stop
one of those rounds.
- Beth: We can't even go outside.
- Carol: Not in the daylight.
Rick says we're not
running, we're not running.
No, better to live like rats.
You got a better idea?
Yeah, we should have slid
out of here last night
But we lost that
window, didn't we?
I'm sure he's got scouts on every
road out of this place by now.
We ain't scared of that prick.
Merle:
That truck through
the fence thing,
that's just him
ringing the doorbell.
We might have some thick
And if he takes the high ground
shoot, he could just starve
us out if he wanted to.
Let's put him
in the other cell block.
No. He's got a point.
This is all you.
You started this.
What difference whose fault it is?
What do we do?
I said we should leave.
Now Axel's dead.
We can't just sit here.
Get back here!
You're slipping, Rick.
We've all seen it.
We understand why.
But now is not the time.
You once said
this isn't a democracy.
Now you have to own up to that.
I put my family's life
in your hands.
So get your head clear
and do something.
You shouldn't be out here.
I'm a good shot.
Yes, you are.
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?
If I say something, will
you promise not to be mad?
I won't get mad.
You should stop.
Stop what?
Being the leader.
Let Hershel and Daryl
handle things.
You deserve a rest.

Governor: How many
does that give us now?
with chronic conditions,
hearing impairments, arthritis.
Adding those gives us 26.
And if we include men
and women age 13 and up?
You mean boys and girls?
Adolescence-- it's a
Men and women.
There're, uh, 35.
Well, make sure they all have
sidearms and plenty of ammo.
We'll start training
when Martinez is ready.
Well, come in.
What's this I hear
about the prison?
You said you were
gonna leave it alone.
No retaliation.
I went to negotiate.
Bad enough we got
biters at our gates.
We can't have aggressors
just miles away.
So you went and welcomed
them to the neighborhood?
You know they shot at us?
I don't know who these people
were when you were with them,
but they've changed.
They're bloodthirsty.
You knew about this?
I was informed this morning.
I didn't know.
Don't drag him into it.
You're right.
This is between you and me.
I'm sick of this.
Sick of the lies.
And I'm not gonna watch this town
and my friends gun each other down.
Well, it's too late.
What do you mean it's too late?
I don't know what
you're trying to prove,
but enough is enough.
I'm going to see them.
I'll work this out.
Well, they're hostile.
These are all the
able-bodied people we have.
They're gonna carry arms
and receive training.
We won't get caught
sleeping again.
One car, that is all I need.
The roads are blocked.
We barely made it
back ourselves.
Andrea.
You go to that prison,
you stay there.
Karen:
Okay? He has asthma. He can't
run more than 10 yards
before losing his breath.
What good is that to you?
Martinez: The Governor wants
everyone who can hold a gun
- in front of the town hall now.
- No.
Andrea, you have to
straighten this out.
They want Noah to fight.
Who's talking about fighting?
You're supposed to be teaching
people to defend themselves,
not raising an army.
Wake up.
The only way to defend
ourselves is with an army.
Take watch.
Eyes open, head down.
Field's filled with walkers.
I didn't see any
snipers out there,
but we'll keep Maggie on watch.
I'll get up in the guard tower,
take out half them walkers, give these
guys a chance to fix the fence.
Or use some of the cars
to put the bus in place.
We can't access the field without
burning through our bullets.
So we're trapped in here.
There's barely any food or ammo.
Been here before.
We'll be all right.
That's when it was just us.
Before there was
a snake in the nest.
Man, we gonna go
through this again?
Look, Merle's staying here.
He's with us now.
- Get used to it.
- Hey.
All y'all.
Seriously, Rick, I don't think Merle
living here is really gonna fly.
I can't kick him out.
I wouldn't ask you to live with
Shane after he tried to kill you.
Merle has military experience.
He may be erratic,
but don't underestimate
his loyalty to his brother.
What if we solve both
problems at once?
Deliver Merle to the Governor.
Bargaining chip.
Give him his traitor,
maybe declare a truce.
You're the farmer, Hershel.
And you're the
black sheep, Merle.
How'd you lose it?
I was bit.
Bit?
You hack it off yourself?
No.
Rick did.
Awful kindly of him.
Saved my life.
Gave me more time
with my girls.
Gave you more time
with your brother.
Can't put a price on that.
Can't put a price
on anything anymore.
I found this
in one of the cells.
Lost more than the Good
Book there for a while.
Lost my way.
"And if your right hand
offends you,
cut it off, cast it from you.
For it is profitable
that one of your members
should perish--"
"And not that thy whole body
should be cast into hell."
Matthew 5:29 and 30.
Woodbury had
a damn fine library.
One of the only things
I miss about it.
When the Governor returns,
he's gonna kill me first.
Michonne, my brother,
then your girls.
Glenn, Carl, the baby,
whoever else is left.
He'll save Rick for last
so he can watch his family
and friends die ugly.
That's who you're dealing with.
This is Mrs. McLeod.
She's the one with arthritis.
Well, thank you, dear,
but we'll find another way
you can help us.
Noah's asthmatic.
You ever shoot a gun, son?
I had a BB gun once.
My mom took it away.
Well, you're gonna learn
from the best.
Haven't had a chance to say
I'm glad you came back.
To what?
All this?
This is our home.
This is a tomb.
That's what T-Dog
called it.
Thought he was right
till you found me.
He's your brother,
but he's not good for you.
Don't let him bring you down.
After all,
look how far you've come.
We sealed it thoroughly.
Nobody's getting in or out.
I'm gonna ask you something
and I need you to be honest.
Okay.
The fight at the prison,
you swear you didn't know
anything about it?
I wouldn't advocate
a move like that.
It's just posturing.
Good. Then you have
to cover for me.
I'm going to the prison.
- And the Governor can't know.
- Don't.
I have to.
I was with them.
Don't put me in this situation.
- I wish there was another way.
- If he finds out--
That's a chance
we have to take.
Maybe you do, but I don't.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Look at what's happened.
Woodbury is an armed camp
with child soldiers.
Cannon fodder in a war
over what?
Is that what
all your work is for?
Please, help me
get out of here.
I can't take a car.
They won't open the gates.
I just need to sneak out,
make my way to the prison,
- and talk to Rick.
- This is a betrayal.
No, it's an attempt to stop this
before more people get killed.
You can do this, Milton.
Come in.
You asked me
to keep tabs on her.
That's right.
She's going back to the prison
and has requested
my assistance in escaping.
Her words, not mine.
Help her.
Okay, do you really
want me to do that,
or is this some sort of test?
If she asks for help,
help her.
Milton.
Good work.
Hey, you!
Oh, shit.
Andrea!
Pin it down.
Don't let it up.
Just a little more.
Lift its head.
Force it down.
- Hey, hold it! Hold it!
- Milton: I'm trying.
Watch out.
All right.
Can we finish this up, please?
I got it.
I got it.
Smart to stay fit.
Don't leave out the cardio.
we should clear the air.
This whole hunting
you down thing,
Hmm.
Like the Gestapo.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Before and after.
Anyway, hope we
can get past it.
Let bygones be bygones.
It's a diversionary tactic.
It keeps the walkers away.
Didn't work so well
with those two.
You got a camp?
It's just us.
We have a town.
It's walled.
Milton:
There's about 70 of us.
You take people in?
We do.
- I'll take them back.
- Are you sure?
- If he asks, just--
- I'll handle it.
I'm better with him
than I am with them.
Thank you so much.
We've had a rough
couple of days.
- Where you going?
- Got to finish my run.
- By yourself?
- I'll be fine.
Got my guardian angel here.
- Need any help?
- Nope.
I'm good.
Carl:
Something weird out there.
Andrea.
Go.
Clear!
- Are you alone?
- Open the gate.
Are you alone?!
Rick!
Open it.
Hands up!
Turn around.
Turn around now!
All right. Get down,
on the floor.
I asked if you were alone.
I am.
Welcome back.
Get up.
After you saved me,
we thought you were dead.
Hershel, my God.
I can't believe this.
Where's Shane?
And Lori?
Hershel: She had a girl.
Lori didn't survive.
Neither did T-Dog.
I'm so sorry.
Carl.
Rick, I--
You all live here?
Here and the cell block.
There?
Well, can I go in?
- I won't allow that.
- I'm not an enemy, Rick.
We had that field and courtyard
until your boyfriend
tore down the fence
with a truck and shot us up.
He said you fired first.
Well, he's lying.
He killed an inmate
who survived in here.
We liked him.
He was one of us.
I didn't know
anything about that.
As soon as I found out, I came.
I didn't even know you were in
Woodbury until after the shoot-out.
That was days ago.
I told you, I came
as soon as I could.
- What have you told them?
- Nothing.
I don't get it.
I left Atlanta with you people
and now I'm the odd man out?
He almost killed Michonne
and he would have killed us.
With his finger on the trigger.
Isn't he the one
who kidnapped you?
Who beat you?
Look,
I cannot excuse or explain
what Philip has done.
But I am here trying
to bring us together.
We have to work this out.
There's nothing to work out.
We're gonna kill him.
I don't know how
or when, but we will.
We can settle this.
There is room at Woodbury
for all of you.
You know better than that.
What makes you think
this man wants to negotiate?
Hershel:
Did he say that?
No.
Rick: Then why did
you come here?
Because he's
gearing up for war.
The people are terrified.
They see you as killers.
They're training to attack.
I'll tell you what.
Next time you see Philip,
you tell him I'm gonna
take his other eye.
We're taken too much shit
for too long.
He wants a war?
He's got one.
Rick.
If you don't sit down
and try to work this out,
I don't know
what's gonna happen.
He has a whole town.
Look at you.
You've lost so much already.
You can't stand alone anymore.
You want to make
this right, get us inside.
- No.
- Then we got nothing to talk about.
There are innocent people.
You poisoned them.
I just told them the truth.
I didn't choose him over you.
I wanted a life.
Once we entered Woodbury,
you became hostile.
- That's 'cause I could see it.
- See what?
That you were under his spell from
the second you laid eyes on him.
- That is not true.
- And you still are.
No, I am there
because those people need me.
And what about these people?
I'm trying to save them, too.
I did not realize the messiah
complex was contagious.
Go to hell, Michonne.
He sent Merle to kill me.
Would have sent him to kill you,
too, if you had come with me.
But you didn't, did you?
Hm-mmm.
You chose a warm bed
over a friend.
That's why I went back
to Woodbury.
Exposed him for what he is.
I knew that it would hurt you.
Dr. Stevens will be here soon.
We'll get you checked over.
- Thank you.
- No, it's my pleasure.
Now you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.
We got food,
fresh clothing, hot water.
Normally we'd provide you with
weapons and a car for your journey,
but we need all we have.
Looks like you're battening down the hatches.
Were you guys attacked?
Yeah, but not by biters.
Some dangerous people out there.
They came at us a few days ago.
Anyone hurt?
There were several fatalities.
- Ben: Damn. Sorry.
- Yeah.
Can't be too careful
these days.
We just came from there.
Ran into some
whack-job in a prison.
You saw him?
Oh, yeah.
Screaming like an idiot.
He's a little unhinged.
But the others seemed decent.
Everything seemed cool
until their leader came back
and practically shoved
a gun in my face.
You were at the prison?
We went in for shelter.
Lost Allen's wife.
This guy Rick showed up
all of sudden, chased us out.
You need help with these guys?
We're in.
Well, now, no...
we couldn't ask you
to join in our fight.
Look, we don't want
to be out there.
It's only a matter
of time before--
No, I understand.
Whatever we got to do
to earn our keep.
Were you inside the prison?
Can you describe the layout?
It's pretty confusing,
but I could try.
You get your rest.
We can talk about it tomorrow.
As I say, you're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.
But you take the night.
Talk it over.
Good night.
You can't leave without
meeting Little Ass-Kicker.
May I hold her?
- Of course.
- Oh.
Got her?
I got her.
Oh, look at you.
Let me guess.
Daryl named her
"Ass-Kicker."
That's not really her name.
- Judith.
- Judith.
Hi, Judith.
Oh, how precious are you?
What happened to Lori?
During a C-section.
Maggie.
- Carl had to--
- Oh, my God.
T-Dog died leading me
to safety.
And Shane?
Rick killed him.
The night we left the farm.
That whole Randall
thing was a lie.
Shane tried to kill Rick.
Shane loved Rick.
Shane loved Lori.
Rick's become cold.
Unsteady.
He has his reasons.
The Governor,
you need to do something.
I am.
No, you need to sleep with him.
Give him the greatest
night of his life.
You get him to drop his guard.
Then when he's sleeping,
you can end this.
Thanks.
Can you spare it?
Yeah.
Well, take care.
Andrea.
Be careful.
You, too.
Go!
Heads up!
Hey, get down.
That's far enough!
Hands up.
I went to the prison.
They're broken,
living in horrible conditions.
Michonne there?
Merle?
Yes.
And Rick?
Yes.
He send you back here?
No.
That was my call.
Why?
'Cause you belong here.
They hung a sign
up in our town
If you live it up,
you won't live it down
So she left Monte Rio, son
Just like a bullet
leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes
and Monroe hips
She went and took
the California trip
Well, the moon was gold
and her hair like wind
Said don't look back now
Well, he gave her
a dime-store watch
And a ring
made from a spoon
Everyone's looking
for someone to blame
If you share my bed,
you share my name...
Some reunion, huh?
She's in a jam.
We all are.
Andrea's persuasive.
This fella's armed
to the teeth.
Bent on destruction.
So what do you want to do?
We match it.
I'm going on a run.
I'll head out tomorrow.
No, you stay here.
Keep an eye on your brother.
I'm glad you're back, really,
but if he causes
a problem, it's on you.
I got him.
- I'll take Michonne.
- Daryl: You sure that's a good idea?
I'll find out.
And Carl.
He's ready.
You hold it down here.
You got it.
Beth:  When there's nothing
left to keep you here
When you're falling behind
in this big blue world
Male vocalist:

Well, your old hometown
