Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...
Aaron: My name is Aaron...
Sasha: He has a camp, he wants
us to audition for membership.
Aaron: If we found a group,
we wanted to be able to bring
them all home.
There's enough room
for all of us.
Michonne: We need this.
So we're going.
All of us.
Rick Grimes: Some time tonight
we'll be outside his camp's walls,
I'm going to have to decide
whether to bring my family in.
I'm not sure if anything can
convince me to go in there.
-
-
We brought dinner.
Aaron:
Come on in, guys.
Before we take this any further, I need
you all to turn over your weapons.
Stay, you hand them over.
We don't know
if we want to stay.
It's fine, Nicholas.
If we were gonna use them, we
would have started already.
Aaron: Let them talk
to Deanna first.
Who's Deanna?
She knows everything you'd
want to know about this place.
Rick, why don't you start?
Sasha.
It's a good thing we're here.
Hello.
I'm Deanna Monroe.
Rick Grimes.
- You mind if I film this?
- What?
Do you mind if I film our talk?
Go ahead.
- Rick:
-
Deanna: We're about
transparency here.
Please.
Since the beginning.
We didn't know
each other before.
I was a congressperson.
Ohio, 15th district.
You?
Oh, I know it does.
What is this place?
This is the start
of sustainability.
That's what the brochures
we found say.
This was a planned community
with its own solar grid,
cisterns,
eco-based
sewage filtration.
Starting in the low 800,000s...
...if there is such a thing.
And they sold them all.
How did you end up here?
Well, my family and I were
trying to get back to Ohio
so I could help my district
manage the crisis.
And...
...the army
stopped us on a back road
and directed us here.
They were supposed
to come later.
They didn't.
But there were supplies here
and we made the best of it.
You put up the wall?
Well, there was
this huge shopping mall
being built nearby.
And my husband Reg is a
professor of architecture.
And who he was
mattered quite a bit.
He got the first plates up
with our sons.
And after a few weeks,
more people arrived
and we had help.
We had a community.
You've been behind these
walls this entire time?
We need people who have
lived out there.
Your group is the first
we've even considered
taking in for a long time.
You should keep
your gates closed.
Why?
Because it's all
about survival now.
At any cost.
People out there are always
looking for an angle.
Looking to play
on your weakness.
They measure you
by what they can take from you.
By how they can use you to live.
So bringing people into
a place like this now--
Are you telling me
not to bring your people in?
Are you already
looking after this place?
Aaron doesn't know me.
I've killed people.
I don't even know
how many by now.
But I know why they're all dead.
They're dead so my family,
all those people
out there, can be alive.
So I could be alive for them.
Sounds like I'd want
to be part of your family.
Rick,
northern Virginia was
effectively evacuated.
Millions of people gone.
For a long time, there's
hardly been anyone here,
living or dead, but still...
we have lost people.
And...
I've done things.
What have you done?
I exiled three men
who didn't work out.
And we both know that's
as good as killing them.
What do you want from us?
These families...
these families should be
able to raise their children
in a safe environment.
Your son, your daughter,
should have a place to grow up.
What do I want?
I want you to help us survive.
I know you can help us do that.
How?
I am exceptionally good
at reading people.
If I didn't win reelection,
I was gonna be a
professional poker player.
I'm not kidding.
Rick...
it's 3:37 P.M.
You're skeptical.
You have a right to be.
But it's time to decide
if you're the one
who's doing the deciding.
I was a sheriff.
They're still your guns. You can check
them out whenever you go beyond the wall.
But inside here,
we store them for safety.
Should have brought another bin.
- Both of 'em?
- At your disposal.
I'd call dibs on that one.
It's got more curb appeal.
Listen, I know you're
still feeling us out,
but I'm glad you came.
Anyway, Deanna's asked everyone
to give you your space
so they aren't all
coming at you at once.
Take your time.
Explore.
You need anything, you call me.
I don't-- we don't
have phones.
I-- I meant...
I'm four houses down.
- Thank you.
- So...
Hey.
I work in the pantry.
Deanna asked me to bring these
over for you and your friends.
Thank you.
We're just cleaning up.
I can see that.
You still have some shaving
cream on your chin.
I'm Jessie.
Rick.
You know, I used
to be a stylist.
And 12 other things.
I could give you
a cut if you want.
You don't even know me.
I can take care of myself.
I have two boys, Ron and Sam.
Ron's my oldest boy.
He's about your son's age.
I could introduce them.
- If that's okay with you and--
- It's just me.
No, that'd be--
that'd be great.
I'm sorry.
Electricity, showers,
haircuts--
I never thought
I'd see those again.
Come on.
Haircuts were never going away.
It's okay if you're
not okay with this yet.
That's better.
Deanna: You're welcome
to sit, Daryl.
I won't bite.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Daryl, do you want to be here?
The boy and the baby,
they deserve a roof.
I guess.
You can look.
Just be quick.
Okay.
These are like mansions.
Mm-hmm. And they're
just giving them away.
You coming?
Yeah, in a sec.
They're right next
to each other, but--
They took our weapons and now
they're splitting us up.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We'll all be staying
in the same house tonight.
How long was I in there for?
Rick:
God, I could not stop brushing.
Huh.
I've never--
I've never seen
your face like that.
That's what I felt
before and after.
Look...
I get why we're playing it safe.
We should.
I just--
I have a good feeling
about this place.
Well, I hope you're right.
Yeah, me, too.
Rick, I--
- Wow.
-
I didn't know
what was under there.
Listen, I don't
mean to interrupt.
I just wanted to stop by and
see how you were all settling.
Staying together.
Rick:
You said you're a family.
That's what you said.
Everybody said
you gave them jobs.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Part of this place.
Looks like the communists
won after all.
Well, you didn't give me one.
I have.
I just haven't told you yet.
Same with Michonne.
And I'm just trying to figure Mr.
Dixon out, but I will.
You look good.
If this is how
you're saying it is...
then this is what we wanted.
We're ready for this.
Deanna:
All of us.
They said explore.
Let's explore.
Nah, I'll stay.
All right.
Lori and me,
we used to drive through
neighborhoods like this.
Thinking, "One day..."
Well, here we are.
We'll be back.
- Come on. Come on.
-
Rick, you okay?
Did Carl and Judith walk by?
We were out and they
were ahead of me.
It's okay. I think I
know where they are.
That's Natalie and Bob Miller.
They had five kids
and 12 grandkids.
It's been a long time since anyone
around here has seen a baby.
She's gonna have to put up
with some pinched cheeks.
Thanks.
I just, um--
It's okay.
I get it.
Look, I'm sorry I broke
whatever that was I broke.
It's a sculpture
I'm making with the boys.
It's an owl.
I mean, it will be.
I just can't get the eyes right.
Right, the eyes.
You didn't even get
a good look at it.
I was in the middle
of losing my mind.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Rick.
Would it be okay
if Carl came over now?
Ron really wants to meet him.
Ron: We're almost always here after
school, so you can come by any time.
You go to school?
It's in a garage.
Little kids go in the morning
and then it's us
in the afternoon.
Probably you, too, right?
Probably.
Guys, this is Carl.
Carl, this is Mikey and Enid.
Hey.
Hi.
Enid's from outside, too.
She just came eight months ago.
Oh, um...
is this yours?
Sorry.
We didn't know you guys
got that house.
We mostly just hang out
there and listen to music.
That's Enid's.
Want to play some video games?
Or Mikey's house
has a pool table,
but his dad's
kind of strict about it.
It's okay.
He's at work.
Um...
Sorry, I guess we
come on kind of strong.
Mikey: You don't even have
to talk if you don't wanna.
Ron: Yeah, took Enid three
weeks to say something.
Pull it together, sport.
Let's, um--
let's play some video games.
Ron:
This is the kind of place
my mom wanted for us.
Deanna:
I didn't just lose her.
I killed her.
It had to be me.
Hey.
How was Ron's house?
What do you think of this place?
Well, I think it seems...
nice.
Yeah.
I like it here.
I like the people.
And I don't want us
to get weak, too.
Hmm.
Deanna hasn't
given me a job yet.
You want one?
Yeah.
Do you?
That's signing the papers.
That's saying yes,
this is how it is.
You afraid to do that?
Aren't you?
No.
So then why are we both awake?
I'm gonna take a walk.
Man:
Yeah.
My wife cut your hair.
Yeah.
Welcome to Alexandria.
I did laundry, gardened, um...
always had dinner
on the table for Ed
when he came home.
Um...
I miss that stupid,
wonderful man every day.
You know, I really didn't have
much to offer this group,
so I think I just sort of
became their den mother.
And they've been
nice enough to protect me.
Deanna: Where do you
think you'll fit in?
Oh, um, hmm.
Well, I'd like to be involved
in the community.
Do you have anything
like a Junior League?
I'm a real people person.
Ow.
Time to punch the clock
and make the casseroles.
What?
Make dinner
for the older people--
moms who need a break,
people who can't cook.
Get to meet a lot
of the neighbors that way.
All right.
Have you taken a shower yet?
Mm-hmm.
Take a shower.
I'm gonna wash that vest.
We need to keep up
appearances, even you.
Hey, I ain't starting now.
I'm gonna hose you
down in your sleep.
You look ridiculous.
We need to make this work.
Deanna:
'Cause...
we were almost
out there too long.
Glenn, Tara, Noah?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Aiden.
You met Nicholas
pulling gate duty.
- Nicholas:
- You're Deanna's son?
That's right. I hear you got
experience making supply runs.
I saw your pantry. You guys
seem to do pretty well.
Yeah, well, had some
training before this. ROTC.
Was nearing lieutenant
when this shit blew in.
- My dad did ROTC.
- He didn't make it?
Nah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry a lot these days.
Come on, I'll show
you the ropes.
We're doing a run today?
Just a dry run.
Show you the terrain outside
the walls, see how you do.
Weigh each other's sack
a little, you know?
No, I don't, but cool.
- What about weapons?
-
We pulled out some sweet-ass
biscuits for today.
-
-
Get ready.
Dad.
Aiden: We've been increasing
our radius mile by mile,
spreading in a semicircle
around the town.
Nicholas: We've made it
Aiden: We break into two groups
when we step outside our vehicle.
If shit hits, we fire a flare.
One group gets the other.
Noah:
Good system.
It is.
Still, you're standing here because
we lost four people last month.
What happened?
Aiden: We were on a
run, roamers came out,
They were good people.
They were.
They were just scared.
Look, I can be
a hard-ass.
And I know I'm a douchebag.
Someone's got to call
the ball around here
and that someone is me.
If you're on this crew,
you do exactly as I say.
Sorry you lost your people.
Yeah.
We got ours.
Managed to snag one of the
deadheads that took them down.
Strung it up there.
What? Why?
Now we have a little
pregame ritual.
Get our heads on straight.
Remind us what we're up against.
Son of a bitch!
Help me find it.
Look at this shit.
Blood's still wet.
It's nearby.
-
- Shh!
Hey-- hey, hey.
It's gone.
It took down one of our friends.
It's nearby, we're not
letting it go.
-
-
Hey, over here.
Come on. Come on.
Hey, come on.
Come at me.
- No, don't touch it.
- The rest of you, back off.
Come on. Come on.
Come here.
Come on. Come on.
Come on now. Come on!
Damn it!
Aiden:
- What the hell?!
- Yeah, what the hell?
- You almost got her killed!
- I told you all to stay back!
I told you to listen
to every damn thing I said.
I told you that.
You three need new gigs.
You're not ready for runs yet.
Yeah, pretty sure
you got that backwards.
Hey. Hey.
Look, we got a way of
doing things around here.
- You tied up walkers.
- It killed our friend.
Look, I'm not having
this conversation.
Then we're just as screwed
as your last run crew.
Say that again.
Tara:
- Come on.
- Come on, man. Just take a step back.
Come on, tough guy.
No one's impressed, man.
Walk away.
Deanna:
This guy's got a problem
with the way we do things.
Why did you let these people in?
Because we actually know
what we're doing out there.
Aiden, no!
That's enough!
Deanna:
I said that is enough!
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
- Let's not do this now.
- Tell him.
You want to end up
on your ass again?
- Aiden:
- Rick: Daryl.
I want everyone
to hear me, okay?
in all ways as equals.
Understood?
Understood.
All of you,
turn in your weapons.
Then you two come talk to me.
I told you I had a job for you.
I'd like you to be
our constable.
That's what you were.
That's what you are.
And you, too.
Will you accept?
Okay.
Yeah, I'm in.
Thank you.
For what?
For knocking him on his ass.
You don't like me, do you?
Rick: You should keep
your gates closed.
Deanna:
Because it's all about
survival now.
At any cost.
We good?
Yeah.
You a cop again?
I'm trying it on for size.
So we're staying?
I think we can start
sleeping in our own homes.
Settle in.
If we get comfortable here,
we let our guard down--
this place is gonna
make us weak.
Carl said that.
But it's not gonna happen.
We won't get weak.
That's not in us anymore.
We'll make it work.
And if they can't make it...
then we'll just take this place.
