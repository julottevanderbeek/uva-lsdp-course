Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Go! Get!
Allez oop!
Allez oop!
Nice little place
you got here.
Kind of lonesome, but
it's nice just the same.
Yeah. I got me
this place rent-free.
Government couldn't
it away!
How's that?
On account of
it's haunted.
Oh, I ain't afraid
of no ghost.
That's good,
because they're liable
to come wafting in and out
of here any old time.
You actually, uh...
I mean, you've seen
them wafting?
Yeah, I've seen
them wafting.
But you don't got to
fret yourself none.
All I do is sing
my ghost song
and they scat...
Like a scalded dog.
How does
that song go
j-just in case
I need it?
Goes like this here.

hey! Where you going?
You got to teach me
that song!
I don't know that song.
You got to teach it to me.
You seen that fellow
who was here?
That fellow
with the, uh...Hey!
You got to
teach me that song!
Look behind you!
Aah!
Folks, you have been
very kind and receptive
to our little presentation
here today.
Just on account of that,
we've got a special surprise
in store for you all.
We don't usually like
to bring her forth
in front of so many folks
on account of
her terrible shyness.
Now, if you folks don't mind
bunching up a bit there,
she needs plenty of room
for this act.
Allow some room and I guarantee
you won't be disappointed.
Now get ready for some of
the wildest horsebacking
you're ever likely to see
this side of the brazos.
Miss Velada McCree,
the Kiowa warrior princess!
There was a young man
from Siam,
who said, "I go
in with a wham!
"While I soon lose
my starch
"like the mad month
of march
and the lion comes out
like a lamb."
Ha ha ha!
Hey! Off you go!
Guess who's come.
Who's come?
Hmm...Hmm!
Shem the sham
or the fairy frog,
perhaps.
That horse swapper.
Horse swapper?
What horse swapper?
The one you swapped
awbonnie for.
Ah, yes.
horse swapper.
He's come back.
So he's come back.
Help me up out of
the bog, would you,
like a true son would
aid an ailing father.
Ow! Aah! Ha!
What's he
come back for?
How in the name of
Seamus should I know?
Hey, do you take me
for a geomancer?
What if he's come for
his horses and his loot?
We ate his horses
outside Omaha,
or did we forget
the hard times?
They couldn't run
a lick anyhow,
miserable snides!
Ha ha!
Maybe awbonnie ran off
on him or something.
She hated being
traded like that.
I knew we were gonna
have to pay for this!
Oh, you should've
been born a female
the way you whine
and whimper.
Now, get me to
the bloody stage!
We got tonic to sell,
miracles to perform.
The whole prairie is
festering for our remedy!
Now, good people
of the open plain,
may I have
your attention, please?
Please,
come in closer, now.
Now, before we reach
our grand finale,
I would like
to introduce to you
the man who's responsible
for our little pilgrimage
into your
forgotten territory...
That horse swapper couldn't
outrun their own feed bill!
That's right, folks!
None other than my father,
doctor and Professor
emeritus
of herbal
prairie medicine,
the honorable
eamon monachain McCree!
Hey! Ha!
Miserable prairie vermin.
Ha!
Fair people
of the raging wind,
have you ever fallen
into a terrible fever
or ever known one who has?
Not the fever of the lovesick
or the forlorn or the cowardly,
yearning for the hearth
of a new england home,
but a real burnin' fever--
a fever of the demon prairie
and all its attendant ills?
Well, I was cast into the eye
of just such a fever
as a wee lad myself,
not more than a day's ride
from the very soil
on which we now stand...
Surrounded by
my primitive captors--
painted faces,
bodies greased in the fat
of the bearded Buffalo...
A language unknown to me,
being a native son of Erin...
A language...
Of the spirit world.
And then...
A vision appeared
to my raw, young mind.
Two eyes like the eyes
of a red-tailed hawk,
teeth like a prairie wolf.
It hung above me face
in a twirling specter!
And then...
And then
it spoke its name.
This was indeed a man
and not an apparition--
an authentic medicine man
from the dreaded
kiowa-comanche nation!
What he was about
to share with me
was a sacred secret
no white man
has ever been made privy to.
A secret which I have brought
here with me today
to share with each
and every one of you--
the ancient sagwa serum
stolen from the kickapoo.
It saved me from
the valley of the shadow,
ladies and gentlemen,
just as it can save you.
Even with
our limited supply,
I am prepared to make
an exceptional offer here today.
The first bottle
of our tonic is free,
together with a dollar
purchase of the second.
That is two bottles
for the price of one.
And we guarantee
your money back
if you aren't
completely satisfied.
Now, when I tell you
that kickapoo sagwa is
a miracle of medical knowledge,
I'm not just tooting my pipe.
Say the malady
is unknown to you.
It hasn't got a name.
It's just a feeling
of malaise
in the blood of the brain.
You take a small tin cupful...
Or straight from the bottle.
You just take it
straight down
and reap
the wonderful benefits.
You'll feel...A glow...
A glow of health.
Health and well-being
move through your blood
right down
to your very core.
Thank you very much.
You bastard!
Ha! Bastard.
Bastard! Oh, yes.
Oh!
Ah, yes!
The horse swapper.
I heard you were
paying us another call.
Prescott, wasn't it?
Prescott
something.
You have a stout
memory, sir.
Roe! Prescott roe!
That's it!
It's the Irish rings
a bell with me.
I never forget
a kinsman,
not in this
forsaken desert.
Even those that
barge right in.
Forgive me, sir.
Not a word of it.
I've grown accustomed
to the primitive
for some time.
In fact,
I prefer it by now.
It's the primitive that
feeds my livelihood.
Drink?
Thank you, no.
Never partake
of the jar.
I remember
that as well!
Ha ha!
A restraint
I hold no envy for.
Ah, well. Set your
bones down, then.
Ha ha! There.
How's
my daughter, then?
Did she serve your
backwards son well?
She's...
She's passed.
Well...
A deal's a deal
after all.
She was healthy when
we made the swap...
Far healthier than
your son, by all accounts.
I can't very well return
the horses now, anyway.
It's been a year or more.
Poor excuse for horseflesh--
I don't want
the horses.
It's not your fault
that she died.
It happened
in childbirth,
and...
The child
went with her.
I see.
Well.
There's no way
to account
for the trauma
of birth,
is there, now?
That's one I never
got over meself.
Well,
what is it then, eh?
How are we, uh...
Honored by
your sudden visit?
It's my son.
He's taken
a terrible grief over her.
He's fallen even deeper
inside himself.
Weeks now...
He refuses
to eat, speak.
He just...
He just stands
over her corpse
like a lost soul.
Watching,
speaking tongues, guarding,
as though she were
still in the world.
Well, he'll soon get
over that business.
You know how
the heart goes.
Give him time.
After all, 'twas
only his first wife.
He won't get over it.
He'll perish.
He was well on that road
before he met my daughter,
if I remember your
description correctly.
He's worse now.
His mind is...
It's completely gone.
I still fail to see
the object of your
return, Mr. roe.
Insanity is
beyond my domain.
I restrict myself
to the physical woes.
Your second daughter.
I wish to purchase
your second daughter
at the same exchange.
She may distract him
from this endless mourning.
It's the only chance
I have to save my son.
I brought
three sound mounts,
well broken to saddle
and to pack.
I have them hobbled there
on the top of the rise yonder.
I'm not a bottomless pit
of daughters, Mr. roe.
I've only one left now
apparently.
My son will die
without her.
He's close
to it now.
She draws the crowds
like flies now
with her pony act.
She's our
main attraction.
I'll throw in
extra.
What extra? We got
livestock aplenty.
I don't need more horses
that can't get
out of their own way.
Coin.
Cash, then.
The melody rises.
Must have stored some up
over the years, eh?
All that trade with
cavalry, cattlemen?
Not much use for coin
out there in the flats,
is there, Mr. roe?
It weighs a body down.
My son is dying
of grief.
His mind is gone.
I will pay you
anything you ask.
What more
can a father do?
A desperate man
should never lay
all his cards
on the table
when doing business,
Mr. roe.
Well...
Let's have a look at
what you've brought.
Then we can talk
more reasonably.
I'd be obliged, sir.
Flat out of tonic.
Oh, good! That's good.
That's the plan.
Means they'll come
back tomorrow.
Tell them there'll be plenty
for all tomorrow evening.
What's he come for?
Oh, just
a bit of business.
You carry on
with the customers now
before they all
dwindle away on us.
Where's awbonnie?
She's...Mr. Roe, do you
remember my son Reeves?
Yes, I do.
How's my sister,
Mr. roe?
She's...Passed.
'Twas an accident, Reeves.
She died in childbirth.
Couldn't be helped.
Now, you go attend to
the business at hand, eh?
He's always carried
an unnatural fondness
for his half-sisters,
Mr. roe.
You can't blame him
for that.
No, I don't.
Leave him!
He's got a temper
like a red snake.
Best let it stew
till it passes through.
What have you
come back here for?
What, are we all
for sale now?!
I think it best,
under the circumstances,
if we continue our business
another time, Mr. roe.
It can't wait.
It will have to wait.
You stay still. Stay.
They watch.
They have their eyes.
They listen for you,
but I know them.
I am guarding.
They can't see me.
They think
my mother took me.
They think that.
Please stay.
I will stay until...
Your hair...
Has blown away.
No bone will stay.
No last bone.
You're a dog...
A low dog,
to tie me here.
Awbonnie...
Is it you?
You must leave here.
Now! Leave...
This place.
They will tear your body.
Let them.
Let them
devour me...
So I can fly.
I'll die without you.
Ow!
You keep me bound here
out of your selfish
fear of aloneness.
I'm not your life!
Aah...
No!
No!
Noooo!
Noooo!
Noooo!
Noooo!
Uhh!
Ohh!
It's you that must
release me.
Throw this body
to the wind.
Let them feed her
to their young.
Unh!
Uhh! Uhh!
I'm sorry about this.
I truly am.
But there was no other way
to get it done.
I'll not harm you.
I swear on an oath
to that.
Mmm.
Mmm.
That's the one.
Had her tongue
cut out
for lying to
her headman.
How can you tell
from this far off?
She's the only
bone picker out here.
It's got to be her.
Go on.
Try your Irish luck.
She won't
make a sound.
I'll guarantee that.
Turn yourself around,
Reeves,
or the banshees
will get you.
Do it now!
If I catch you looking,
I'll thrash you
till your knees buckle.
Ha ha ha!
You might as well let him
see how it's done.
Quick, now.
She's got a jump on you!
Uhh!
Look here, boy.
Now, this is what you got
coming up ahead, son.
I made her
my legitimate wife!
I...Mmm...
You don't forget that!
Don't ever forget that!
Don't...Ever...
Forget that!
So you went and swapped
her after all,
just like awbonnie!
You'll go straight
to hell for that!
You might as well
have killed them both
with your own hand!
Killing! Killing!
Now he's on about killing!
Get off! Get off!
Too early in the morning
for killing.
The sun's
barely cracked.
When did they leave?
Who leave? Stop
talking in riddles.
Velada and roe!
They've gone!
Gone?
When did they
take off?
Gone?
As though
you didn't know.
Gone?
Oh! What?
And he's pilfered
the...Paint!
Oh, goddamn
his Irish hide.
Get my mule tacked out
and be quick.
That paint!
That paint
was worth $100.
Bend forward while
I unleash that nose bag.
Do as I say.
I don't expect you to think
too kindly towards me
for my actions,
but I'm asking you to listen
to me with your heart.
Do you remember me?
The selfsame man that
purchased your sister...
A year back, last spring?
Your brother
must have told you.
You must remember.
She was joined
in wedlock to my son.
I chose between you
at the time.
There's no way to foresee
the outcome of a thing.
What I'd hoped to be
my son's salvation...
Became his ruin.
Your sister was his light.
He thrived
in her company.
Then she...
Your sister...
She has since...Died.
No!
If you could give...
Me a sign...
Some sign so...
I'd know...
How to...Find you.
Take me with you.
Awbonnie...
Take me.
¶ the devil he came
to the man at the plough ¶
¶ saying, "one of your family
I must take now" ¶
¶ he said, "my good man,
I've come for your wife" ¶
¶ "for I hear she's the plague
and torment of your life" ¶
¶ so the devil,
he hoisted her up on his back ¶

titty filet ¶
¶ the devil,

¶ and he landed at
hell's hall door with a crack ¶
oh, break it off,
will ya?
Now's not the time
for braying.
Your daughter's
been absconded with,
in case you forgot.
Eh...The daughter,
the daughter.
Eh, that's right.
Had to be
some good reason
we find ourselves adrift
in the lone prairie, eh?
¶ Two other devils
looked over the wall ¶
¶ they said, "take her away
or she'll murder us all" ¶
¶ now, I've been a devil
the most of me life ¶
¶ I ne'er was in hell

¶ so, it's true that the women
are worse than the men ¶
¶ for they went down to hell
and were thrown out again ¶
ha ha ha!
You got a lot of salt
calling yourself
a father at all.
It was forced upon me
by cruel nature.
I never had a say
in the business.
No, sir! A father is not
my calling in this life.
This is true.
Wizard of the plains
is more to my liking.
Ha ha ha!
Wizard of the plains, eh?
Should have
shot his hide
the second
he rode into camp.
Who? Roe? He seemed
a reasonable man to me.
Reasonable?!
How do you find yourself
siding with him
and not
your own daughters?
He's an irishman and
a gentleman, too, I believe.
Horse thievery's
his main transgression.
And believe me, he'll pay
through the teeth for that.
That paint was worth
more than both daughters
and you thrown in,
to boot.
It shames me to be
the son of a pig.
You'll grow out of it.
Just thank your stars
you weren't born a half-breed,
like your demon sisters.
Hey! Ha ha!
¶ There was a young lady
from ulster ¶
¶ whose friends they thought
they had lost her ¶
¶ till they found in the grass
the marks of her ass ¶
¶ and the knees of the man
who had crossed her ¶
hey hey hey!
What time you say that
three o'clock train go out?
Three o'clock train?
Well, that train go out
exactly 60 minutes
past two.
Ha ha ha!
That's funny.
Why is that funny?
Fellow at the depot
told me that train
goes out exactly
Well, you won't miss
your train nohow.
That serum couldn't
cure a well man.
That's
enough business here.
We don't need none of
your carnival trash.
Excuse me.
Which is the other side
of the street?
The other side of
the street? Why--
get your sorry asses
on down the line!
He said--unh--he said
it was over there.
Well, you can't depend
on everything you hear.
Get up!
We're heading east now,
aren't we?
East? This is east?
I'm sure
we're heading east.
It's your deal.
Hey! Where to?
Land!
You can have it!
Hey! We've lost
our leader!
Ha ha ha ha!
You turn your back
on me.
You think you can
refuse me?
I...Remember you.
I was sold
like a slave.
I died giving birth
to your child,
a child
I never wanted.
I hold onto you.
Do you think I would
love you for that?
Take me with you.
You have no right
to ask me that.
You belong
in  world...
Not mine.
You owe me my freedom.
How?
Let my body burn.
Throw it in the fire.
It's you that must
release me.
Then you take your own life!
Do it.
It's in your hands.
Place that gun
in your mouth
and set me free.
I warn you now...
If you don't do
this thing that I ask,
then a curse will fall
on your father's head.
Yes...
Do it.
Your suffering is nothing
compared to what your
father will have to bear.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it!
Uhh!
I was wrong to steal you
against your will,
but you must help me.
I've no one else.
You must help me now.
If your sister
hadn't come,
he would never
have made it.
Do you understand me?
You must replace her.
It's his only chance.
I am not my sister.
I can make you
the same offer
I made
your father.
You'll be richer
than him by far.
Gold coin.
Three mounts.
The very ones
you tried to steal.
Three horses...
And gold.
I am begging you now.
You'll be free
of your father.
Four horses...And gold.
- Ahh!
- That's it, eh?
That's the last of it!
It's time
we turn back now.
It's dark thirty.
They've gone into
a whirlwind here.
I can't make this out.
It's time we turned back now.
The banshees will get us.
We're not turning back!
There's sign here.
Just gotta figure it out.
You're not going to
track a plainsman
out into flatland
he knows better
than the inside
of his own mouth!
We probably passed him
a dozen times already
and never even
known it.
Now, mount up!
And point these leatherheads
for home camp.
We've wasted enough time
on this malarkey!
Are you telling me you just
want to leave her lost?
Abandon her?!
I got a whole troupe back
there loaded with tonic.
They're ready
to move out.
They'll pack out without me!
They'll steal me blind.
I'm not--not trading in
me livelihood
just to pursue
a rat-tail horse thief!
What about Velada?
She'll make do.
She's a kiowa.
She's your daughter!
She's a kiowa first!
You'll never make your way
back without me.
You've lost your sense
of the prairie,
if you ever had one
to begin with!
Wizard of the plains!
Are you refusing me,
then...
Your own father?
You're no father to me.
You'll mount
that miserable gelding now
before I separate
your ears.
You haven't
got the sand.
Try...
Try if you will, son,
to put yourself
in my boots.
I've grown accustomed
to an hourly lubrication
over the years,
and I can't just sever
the connection.
It's not like that.
It's not like a woman.
I've got to get back
to me supply of tonic!
Well, think of
the troupe, then!
Remember that time
in Wichita
when they almost lynched
the whole lot of us?
We can't just leave them
back there in limbo!
Ah, there's no percentage
in this cruelty.
None whatsoever!
You got to think of
your poor father in this.
It's me now.
I mean, I'm the one
that's suffering, not her!
She's an Indian!
They were born to suffer!
Follow.
Heathen children...
The lot!
My sister is sending you
her thoughts.
Your sister is dead.
She is my mother's weapon.
She is moving on you now
with vengeance.
We've got
to get to my son.
We've got to get
to him fast.
I cannot move
against my sister.
Your sister is dead!
She's gone!
She's more alive
than you.
We've made our bargain.
¶ If I was home,
I'd lay in my bed ¶
¶ prop up my feet
and pillow my head ¶
¶ gaze out the window
and look at the sky ¶
¶ and rest while the bluebirds
go whistling by ¶
¶ go whistling by ¶
Angel...
She won't steal you.
She won't...
Take you from me.
No.
Why, she brought--she brought
the demon with her.
No. No!
You must go on to him
by yourself.
Say nothing to him
about me.
All he needs is a voice,
a kindness.
I expect nothing from you
but to comfort my son.
All you must do
is to show him some...
Affection.
Go now.
Save him.
You can do what you want
with my father,
but this body's mine!
It belongs to me!
You'll never separate us!
I hold this body!
I will send you to
your death a second time
if you touch her!
He's afoot now.
Look at this.
He's got to be afoot.
You've not got the mental gift
to track this man.
He's schemin' you.
Can't you tell by now?
If he's afoot,
there's a reason for it.
He is leading us
to our doom.
Velada's
escaped him. Look.
Look for yourself.
He's afoot.
I've got him now.
You're an idiot.
He's got you!
You're playing right
into his hand.
She slipped away
from him, I tell you.
Yaah!
Insanity's a sorry thing.
Dear lord in heaven,
save me from it.
A Professor deserves
a better fate than this.
I'm a European,
not a savage.
Whatever in the world
you do now, son,
don't raise your eyes
to the horizon.
Put your eyes back down,
you fool.
Don't look at them.
Keep your horse moving
at the same pace.
Don't change stride
an inch.
It's just
a hunting party.
Just a hunting party?
And what do you suppose
they might be hunting?
I'm telling you now,
if we don't turn back,
their dogs will be eating
our testicles by nightfall.
Now listen to reason,
this has gone far enough.
We're not
quitting this.
Your stubbornness
is going to get us skinned.
Is it stubborn
to reclaim what is ours?
She was stolen from us.
If it means our hides,
then let him have her.
What is she to you except
a reminder of your sins?
We're going to find her,
even if we both die
doing it.
They've gone.
They'll be back,
and there won't be
just a handful next time.
There will be so many
you'll think
the prairie sprouted them.
I wasn't descended
from proud Irish chieftains
in order to have me hide
stripped away by heathens.
Eat.
You must eat.
Take it.
Yes! Eat, now.
Get your strength back.
That's it.
That's it.
Trust her.
Just let her help you.
Talbot.
Talbot,
listen to me, now.
You must forget about
this death.
Let go of it.
It's poisoned you enough.
Look into her eyes.
She will bring you back.
Aah!
Sister...
You betray our mother.
You trade yourself
for horses and gold.
You are lower
than the father who sold us.
You like bargaining
with whites?
Well, then you bargain
with me--your sister.
You move in close
to this squirming dog,
you pretend
that you love him,
you push your skin
next to him,
and then you take my body,
and you burn it!
You owe this to our mother!
If you run...
I will hunt you down...
And cut your tongue out
so you will never ever,
never, never, never forget
who gave you birth, do you?

is drawing near" ¶

I had envisioned
a better ending!
One with far less pain!
Not glory or riches, eh?
Just painless and numb.
It was youthful lust,
out and out,
full of all its raw
and mindless pleasure.
Something you, no doubt,
have never experienced, eh?
Such a faithful,
honorable brother as you.
I could've let her wander
through the bones forever.
Never touched her at all!
At least I made her
my legitimate wife,
showed her some pity,
which is more than
I can say for her now.
She's paying me back.
Do you understand that?
She's sending her dog soldiers
out to get me,
I guarantee you that!
Isn't that just
like a kiowa, huh?
They cut her tongue out,
she rushes back to their fold
first chance she gets.
I fed her and clothed her
all those years.
She deserts me
back to her tormentors.
Shoot your mount and bury
yourself! They've come!
Dismount and shoot him now!
They'll be on us any second!
They're not moving.
Dismount.
Aah!
Looks like you'll be
the one afoot now.
I never wanted to
swap her, you know.
It wasn't my idea.
It was roe's.
Besides, we needed
horses at the time.
At least
leave me a carbine!
I'll be useless
against them without it!
It's not just me they want,
you know!
They'll come after you
in the night!
And don't think they won't!
You're not absolved
from this,
high and mighty
faithful brother!
They'll separate you forever
from your manhood!
You're not absolved.
Who sent you here?
Who sent you?
It was your father.
Reeves!
Reeves!
Reeves! You can't
abandon me to this!
We're flesh and blood,
Reeves!
Europeans!
Europeans!
Don't forget that!
Kings and queens, eh?
Knights of valor!
Masters of an empire!
Reeves!
Masters! Masters!
Not dogs! Not dogs!
We can't--we can't
succumb to this...
This barbarism.
We've got
to cling together...
Cling together
at all costs!
Reeves. Reeves.
Reeves.
Reeves.
Reeves!
Hey!
Ha! Aah!
Madness is
a sorry thing.
Reeves! Reeves!
Aah! Uh! Uh! Aah!
Good boy.
Be still. Be still.
Be still.
Nice and easy.
Still in the market
for a wife, Mr. roe?
No. Don't go.
Don't go now.
You've come so far.
It's you.
It's you
who torments him.
Why can't you
set him free?
He holds
no blame in this.
It was me.
It was me...
Who brought it
on his head.
And it's you
who will pay.
You'll never save your son.
You know that, don't you?
Mmm...You've always
known that.
Ha ha ha!
He's far out of your reach.
Far beyond you.
He's in another world.
You think my sister
can reach him?
My sister?
What is she to him?
Another squaw.
Another kiowa dog
sold for horses.
What was the price
you paid, Mr. roe?
What was the price
you paid for me?
Three horses, wasn't it?
And you think my sister's
worth four, Mr. roe?
Why is she worth four?
She's the same as me.
She's just going
to die on you
just like I did.
Uhh!
Unh!
Unh!
Ha ha ha!
Your father has come
to save you.
Ha ha ha!
Sister!
You think
you can replace me?
You think you can
replace me in his heart?
Ask him.
Ask him who holds
his heart.
He will tell you.
Tell her!
Tell her!
Tell her
how you can't live...
Without me.
I am holding you.
You can't
steal it from me.
It...Is...Mine!
No!
Aah!
Come.
It's done now.
It's finished.
It's finished.
Go ahead.
You'd say we were
safe now, wouldn't you?
I mean, if you weren't
an Irish lunatic.
Ha ha ha!
Which you're not.
You'd say we're safe out of
Indian country, wouldn't you?
You had no business
taking us this far out.
Whoa.
Endangering our lives
for a short con,
but this looks
good and safe to me.
Wouldn't you say so?
I mean, if you were
white and halfway sane?
Ha ha ha!

fair people
of the raging wind,
have you ever fallen
into a terrible fever?
Fever...
Or known anyone who has?
Not the fever
of the lovesick
or the cowardly
or the forlorn,
yearning for the hearth
of a new england home,
but the real
burning fever!
The fever
of the demon prairie
and all its
attendant ills.
Aah! Oh!
Remarkable, isn't it,
how things come true?
I'd invented
this little fable, you see,
the very one
I'm now living.
I conjured it up
out of me own imagination.
Oh, it was my sales pitch,
you see.
Yes. Infallible.
Worked every time.
Yes. Worked every time.
In fact,
it was my very livelihood.
Oh, yes! Aah!
I...Ah...
"Surrounded by
my primitive captors...
"Painted faces...
A language unknown to me,
being a native son of Erin."
Oh! Ha ha ha! Hey!
I--I--I don't suppose
you know
my former wife,
by any chance, eh?
Ha ha! She ran off on me,
oh, several summers back.
She...
She was unmistakable.
Aah ha!
Yeah! Yeah...
Oh, unmistakable.
You'd know her by sight.
Yes, she...
She had no tongue,
you see.
No tongue to speak of.
Aah!
Anyway,
if you come across her,
please...
Please impress upon her
that I have now paid...
More than paid
for her defilement.
I'm now completely
absolved!
Will you tell her that
for me?
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Nice little
place you got here.
It's kind
of lonesome,
but it's nice
just the same.
Yeah, I got me
this place rent-free.
Government couldn't
it away
on account
that it's haunted.
Oh, I ain't afraid
of no ghost.
Well, that's good,
because they're liable
to come wafting
in and out of here
any old time.
You actually, uh...
I mean, you seen
them wafting?
Yeah,
I seen them wafting,
but you don't gotta
fret yourself none.
Alls I do is sing them
my ghost song,
and they scat
like a scalded dog.
How does that
song go
just in case
I need it?
Goes like this here.
