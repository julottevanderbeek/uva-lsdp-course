- Previously on "Killer Women"...
- Dan: That's cocaine.
And you're hauling a
whole hell of a lot of it.
Damn it, Billy, you're looking at
Molly, listen. I need to take off.
You mean from me.
You dumped her?
Look, she can't know about this.
And I don't lie to the people I love.
From the D.E.A.'s point
of view, he's an asset...
could help us get closer to
the higher-ups in the cartel.
Nestor: Are you working for the government?
If I was a snitch, the cops
would be in here already.
D.E.A.!
You tell your prosecutor I'm done.
It doesn't work that way.
It does now.
Sign the divorce papers,
or I'll tell the world who you really are.
I'm never gonna divorce you.
When I was married to Jake, he beat me.
And I'm gonna tell the world.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Ranger Parker, can you
please tell the court
why you're here today?
I want to change the grounds
of my petition for divorce.
What would you wish to change them to?
Cruelty.
Physical cruelty.
During our marriage,
my husband, Jake Colton,
punched me repeatedly.
And on one occasion, he tried
to kill me by strangling.
Ranger Parker, are you prepared
to describe to us details
of these incidents?
Yes.
I am.
Senator Colton, what do you have to say
about these allegations from your wife?
I'd say I'm disappointed
and heartbroken.
My wife has decided to sling mud, falsely.
Why would she make such
allegations if they weren't true?
Because she's not getting
the divorce she wants
when she wants it.
Think about it. We... we've
been separated for a year.
Don't you find it odd that
she mentions these charges
for the very first time
just days before I launch
my re-election campaign?
It's about hurting me. That's all.
I would love five minutes
alone with that man.
I would take every part
of him and make it hurt.
I don't need my sister-in-law
arrested for murder,
thank you very much.
No jury would convict me.
Hey, Molly, listen.
Why don't you take the
day off and go for a ride?
I need to stay busy, keep my head straight,
but thank you for being here.
Yeah.
Pipe bomb?
Yeah. C-4, maybe TNT.
How long they been out there?
About 40 minutes.
The Sheriff's been on the bullhorn.
And?
Guy's name is Augie Travis.
He found out his wife is
leaving him for another man.
It's his third marriage,
and he swears this one's gonna
last till death do them part.
He's demanding a preacher be
sent out to renew their vows.
So send a preacher.
He's holding a dead man's switch.
If he lets go of that detonator,
we're all blown to Juárez.
No one is going out on that bridge.
I am.
Wait, no. No, you're not.
I have an idea. When I
take off my hat, text me.
Text you what?
A happy face... doesn't
matter. Just text me.

Augie: Go ahead, Ranger.
Take another step. I dare you.
Really want to kiss
the world goodbye today?
I'm not armed.
- I want to talk.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, I don't want to do no talking,
especially not to no woman!
You're all hussies and liars!
I can't argue with you there, Augie.
What do you mean you can't?
Well, we can't help it. It's in our nature.
It goes all the way back
to Eve tempting Adam.
- You read the Bible, right?
- Of course I do.
Well, then, whatever your wife there did,
it shouldn't have surprised you.
It's what we do.
Every woman I marry cheats on me.
Whole damn barrel is rotten.
To the core, Augie.
Cut her loose, right now.
- Send her packing.
- No. No, no, no.
This... this marriage keeps.
And I want that preacher still.
I want the world to know
that what God has joined,
let no man set asunder!
Okay, then...
All right.
I'll tell you what you got to do.
There's one key thing
that'll keep every woman in line, and...
Excuse me.
Sorry, Augie.
I got to go talk to my lieutenant.
No, wait, wait, wait. You were...
you... you were saying...
Oh, yeah.
I... I'll call you with
that. You got a phone?
Well, in my... in my truck, but...
Fine. Here. Take mine.
Go, go, go!
You lied to me!
Told you we can't be trusted.
Yeah, well, nothing happened
out there. I didn't hurt nobody.
So this is... this is no big deal, right?
Kidnapping, terroristic threats...
- it's kind of a big deal.
- Well, m... maybe you could
go easy on me if I tell you something.
Yeah, the world's heard enough
out of you for one day, Augie.
No, wait. I know... know about a murder.
- Yeah, sure you do.
- Yeah, it's an old one.
Body was found down by Kyle,
by the soil conservation reservoir.
I know who did it.
So maybe we could work something out.
Hey? What do you say?
Man: All right, trooper, stand down.
Hey. Hey!
Really?
We've been trying to solve
that one for 10 years.
I heard what Molly said in court today.
Did you know about that,
about her husband beating her?
No. She never told anybody.
Did you talk to her?
Been trying to reach her all day.
Just radio silence.
Well, "A," she's probably embarrassed.
"B," you just broke up with her,
so it's not your business if it ever was.
And, "C," is this really what
you called me here to talk about?
No. I had a conversation
with the U.S. attorney today.
I tried, Billy, but he's
not letting you off the hook.
Look, Dan, I got two kids, okay?
I got a third one on the way.
I can't keep playing cops and
robbers with the damned cartel.
It's not my call.
You either help us out,
or you go to prison.
I'll be in touch.
Okay, talk.
Well  last year, I did a...
a bit in Huntsville for
breaking and entering.
My cellmate till he... till he got out
was this guy, Mims... Mims Shackleford.
Real piece of work.
You know, you don't get these in prison.
Keep going. Mims...
Yeah.
Well, he liked to carry on
like he was some hard-ass criminal.
And this one time he...
he tells us he buried a
girl's body down by Kyle.
Did he mention the name of the girl?
No, I don't think so.
Did he say why he killed her?
Anything else?
Just girl, dead, Kyle, reservoir.
Well, uh, he did mention
that she was strangled,
you know, if that helps.
Hey.
So, hey, do I got a deal or not?
Hey. Hey, I didn't hurt nobody!
Hey, come on!
Her name was Tara Sills...
strangled, buried at the reservoir.
Tara Sills... 18 years old, Florida native.
Juvie record as long as your arm.
She got to Texas one week
before she was killed.
Maybe because she met
this Mims Shackleford?
We should ask him. I'll track him down.
Oh.
Autopsy report says the body
was bloated, unrecognizable.
Yeah, from the damp in
the soil by the reservoir.
Who I.D.'d the body, then?
No known relatives.
- It's not in the file?
- What file?
Look how thin it is.
Where are the interviews, notes, timelines?
Case like this should have
paperwork to fill a banker's box.
That figures.
What does?
The Ranger on the case was Colt Ritter...
old-school, never wrote anything down...
- kept it all in his head.
- Ritter?
One of the old-timers who quit in protest
when women joined the rangers?
Man's a top-shelf jackass.
Maybe, but Colt Ritter is the file.
Pay him a visit and get what you need.
Where do I find him?
Mr. Ritter?
I'm Ranger Parker.
I'm busy here, little lady.
Mm. Neighborhood watch?
Hell no.
I'm waiting for my damn wife to go out.
The old battle-ax is on the warpath
because I forgot her birthday.
I just have a few questions about...
There she goes.
Now I can go inside and
eat my lunch in peace.
Mr. Ritter, it's about the Tara Sills case.
It's Ranger Ritter.
Give me your info. I'll be in touch.
And, ma'am, you may want to move your feet.
I don't want to run over them.
Vámonos. Let's go. Stores are closing.
We're always late for everything else.
Why break the streak now?
Hey, Aunt Molly. See you later.
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
You remember when I was 10,
I got a baseball mitt for Christmas?
Okay.
I wanted to play catch
right away with Andy Collins.
But we didn't have a
ball, so we used rocks.
He threw one real hard
and busted my head open?
I fixed it.
Yes, you did.
You... you used
a mound of ground pepper
to stop the bleeding.
You remember that?
You're always there for me, Molls.
I should have been there for you.
I should have seen this.
Please... No.
I worked damn hard to hide it.
I just don't get it, you know?
If there's any woman that could
take this guy down, it's you.
I really believed...
that if I loved him more,
he'd hate me less,
and so I didn't want to fight back.
And then later...
I couldn't face the shame.
"A Texas Ranger can't protect herself,
how's she gonna protect the streets?"
Hey.
Well, at least it's almost over, yeah?
No, not quite.
I'm gonna be cross-examined.
God, I swear, I'm gonna whup that bastard.
Hey.
No need.
I'm telling the truth,
and that's gonna whip him bad enough.
Colt: Ms. Molly Parker,
it's Ranger Colt Ritter paying you a visit!
- Ms. Parker!
- Perfect.
Go on.
I made a few calls about you.
You're the little lady that
went crying to the judge
about her marital problems.
How do you expect to be a ranger?
I wasn't crying.
I mean, it's none of your damn business.
And I am a ranger,
trying to solve a murder that you couldn't.
Tara Sills?
That case was dead ends all around.
Well, now there's a new suspect...
name of Mims Shackleford.
- He look familiar?
- How am I supposed to see that?
How about now?
Nope.
The killer was Clem Pickett,
a black transient I picked up
near where the body was found.
He was never indicted, but he did it.
Why do you think he did it?
Proximity and color.
Okay, well, now we're looking at Mims.
I'm gonna talk to him as
soon as we get an address.
But first, I need to know
who identified Tara's body.
It wasn't in the case files.
It's right here.
You want to crack that
open and give me a name?
Could do.
But if you're gonna talk
to her, I'm coming with.
- You're retired.
- If you want to see my files,
I saddle up and join you.
Fine. You know where to find me.
I ask the questions, you
don't interfere, and I drive.
I'm not a mute.
If I got something to
say, I'm gonna say it.
Well, fine.
Then you can start by telling
me who identified Tara's body.
Sue Ellen Pike.
And I drive.
See you in the morning.
Sue Ellen: Hey, darling.
Oh, Becky, that's... that's perfect.
And use the bunting, and then we'll...
we'll spread the six flags out. Right?
I see it's not Sue Ellen Pike anymore.
Oh, Ranger Colt.
I got your message. Gosh, it's just...
it's been since... what?...  forever.
And, yes, it's, uh, Sue Ellen Tucker now.
This is Molly Parker.
She's... helping me on the investigation.
- Ranger Molly Parker.
- Ranger.
Can you tell me how you knew Tara Sills?
Oh, well, we, uh... we met on a bus.
We were both coming from
Florida to Texas to...
to start our new lives.
Well, I... I mean, I
was starting my new life.
What do you mean?
Well, my family's originally from Texas.
Both my parents are dead,
but I can trace my lineage
all the way back to the Texan revolution,
so I qualified for the Daughters
of the Alamo College scholarship.
And I'm still very much an
active member of the organization.
Our... our... our big
picnic is this weekend.
- Here's a flyer. You should come on by.
- I'll try.
But you were saying, about Tara Sills...
she wasn't starting a new life?
No. I mean, poor thing.
She was... she was just running.
From what?
From foster homes, bad
influences, petty crime.
I mean, Tara... she was damaged.
But we got to talking on the bus,
and I could tell that she was just...
she was really good-hearted.
So we ended up sharing
that hotel room together
in Austin until, um,
one night, she went out
and just... never came back.
You identified her body when it was found.
How were you able to do that?
Um, her... her clothes,
but mostly, this
this pendant that she wore.
It was an owl with
these big eyes she loved.
Sue Ellen, we want you
to look at some pictures.
She can make them big.
Does this man look familiar?
Does the name Mims Shackleford ring a bell?
You know, I did see Tara with
a man outside the hotel room
the night that she
disappeared, but this isn't him.
- There was a man?
- You never told me that.
Oh, I certainly did.
Remember, I said that Tara...
she was running from the past,
and maybe that man was part of it.
Little lady, this mind is like a vault.
Once I put something
in there, it stays put.
Like your wife's birthday?
That's why you write things down,
for when your vault starts to rust.
We got Mims' home address.
Thanks for your time, ma'am.
Of course.
Ranger.
Mims Shackleford, Texas Rangers!
Oh!
Nobody home.
Looks like we're gonna
have to wait for a while.
Want some chew?
Damn. No more baccy.
What a shame.
Got any food in your pack?
... I had a home
in a big green valley
where the green grass shone
I woke up, stepped outside
Obliged.
Big old grin 'cause it was all mine
Ain't you gonna offer grace?
Grace? It's beef jerky.
Still God's bounty.
Fine.
Without thy sunshine and thy rain
we would not have the golden grain.
Without thy love, we'd not be fed.
We thank thee for our daily bread.
Amen.
Your crops go bad
and you lose your soul
well, you can lose
your mind, lose control
but you ain't going back
to that old dust bowl
Been with my wife since we were 19.
You know the secret?
Ephesians 5:22...
"wives, submit to your own
husbands, as unto the lord."
If you keep reading,
you might come across colossians 3:19...
"husbands, love your wives,
and do not be harsh to them."
You're not the only one
who went to Sunday school.
Mine's damn good advice.
If you'd consider it,
maybe you wouldn't be getting divorced.
Get your own jerky.
That's Mims.
Mims Shackleford?
Texas Rangers! Stop!
Oh! What the hell did you do?!
I halted him.
How's your head? How do you think?
Next time, don't run from the law.
Sure. Anyway, I got nothing to say.
Mm-hmm.
We want to talk to you about
a girl named Tara Sills.
Never heard of her.
Well, that's funny.
We hear you talked her up big
while you were in Huntsville.
People say all kinds of
crap when they're in prison.
You got to play tough.
What's he doing back there?
Don't you mind me, now.
You just keep talking.
What you said wasn't crap.
You knew about the reservoir.
You knew all kinds of things.
Just keep talking to the lady.
Who said I knew?
Was it some other convict?
Maybe he killed that girl.
Killed her? Now, I didn't say she was dead.
How did you know that?
I don't know.
Y'all just trying to confuse me.
So, why won't you just
tell us the way it is?
I...
Evening, Rangers.
I'm Denver Jenkins, Mr.
Shackleford's attorney.
My client has nothing more to say.
He can talk if he wants to.
Well, the thing is, he doesn't want to.
Isn't that right, Mr. Shackleford?
Now, if I could have a
moment alone with my client...
Talk fast.
He has a lineup appointment in 10 minutes.
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Tucker.
Oh, it's no problem, not for Tara.
No, she deserves justice.
Well, it's always best
to see a suspect in person
rather than a picture.
Of course.
Think back as best you can.
Was any of these men
the one you saw with Tara
the night she disappeared?
I'm sorry. I just...
I... I... I don't recognize any of them.
Take your time. There's no need to rush.
She said she didn't recognize anyone.
I don't need a hearing
aid. I heard what she said.
I'm not sure you did.
Sue Ellen, take as long as you want.
I'm sorry.
I gather you heard.
What that man did...
Holster that thought.
Don't go looking for trouble with Jake.
I'm here.
I don't want to be treated
like some fragile little thing.
You don't need to be here.
I'll come find you if I need a hand.
But right now, I just need to move on.
You do not have this situation contained.
I got people snooping all
around the edges of my ranch.
Our people.
We're keeping an eye on
your place, just in case.
Just in case what?
The leader of the Laredo cartel,
El Diablo, is on the move.
The devil? Are you serious?
- It's what they call him.
- Wait a minute.
When you were talking about me
getting to higher-ups in the cartel,
you were talking about this guy?
Correct.
You're a son of a bitch. You know that?
Look, one of his middlemen
was ripping him off,
skimming profits.
It was just a matter of time
before El Diablo dealt with it.
We dealt with it for him.
You dropped me in with that middleman,
knowing that he would come after me,
and then you killed him and
his buddies because it...
Because it what?
It makes you valuable to El Diablo.
He thinks I took out one of his rats.
- Bingo.
- Which makes him inclined
to want to do business with me.
Look, from his point of view,
you're the guy that had the
guts to clean up a mess for him.
Plus, you know how to get
shipments in from Mexico.
You've been doing it already.
He's gonna personally want to meet you
and whoever your team is.
And when he calls to set a
meeting, we're taking him down.
This is unbelievable,
man. This is unbelievable!
Here's the bottom line, Billy.
There's risk. You can say no.
And if I say yes?
All charges will be dropped.
What you did never happened.
Yeah, set it up.
You're doing it wrong.
- I always eat with a fork.
- Not that.
They turn into plates.
- Since when?
- Since forever.
I want to take another run at Mims.
I think I can play him.
Too late.
His lawyer bailed him out this morning.
We had him on a parole violation.
Well, his lawyer made a stink
about police brutality...
something about him
running into Colt's gun.
Lieutenant, working with that man
is like walking around with a
hornet's nest tied to my hip.
Colt.
Smells good.
I've been thinking about Mims all night.
Did you all notice the size of his feet?
Boy sports a size 12, at
least, same as Clem Pickett,
the transient I suspected of the killing.
You mean you had actual
evidence against Pickett,
not just his color?
I'm fair-minded. Ask anyone.
Go track down Mims.
If his lawyer makes a
fuss, I'll handle him.
Shouldn't you offer grace?
It's an egg roll.
God's bounty.
Not home.
Looks like he took his dog this time.
Good.
Uh, you happen to have a
warrant for that screwdriver?
Not needed.
The door's wide open.
Marijuana, lying in plain sight.
Maybe you want to write
that down in case you forget.
I'll make a mental note.
Now you're getting it.
Comic books.
Boy's a real intellectual.
But I do like Archie.
Here we go.
Money order receipts.
Someone's sending Mims cash.
Or paying for that lawyer.
Or to get out of town.
I say we visit his known associates,
bang a few more heads, and
see who knows where he is.
Or we reach out to the wireless companies
and see which cell towers
he's pinging off of.
Pinging?
I'll explain in the car.
Mims' cell bounced off
that tower an hour ago.
You correlate with other
towers and then triangulate.
Uh-huh.
Can it triangulate which one
of these rooms he's hiding in?
Or maybe we just follow the dog.
Somebody didn't want Mims talking.
That's one loyal dog.
Luis: So, what have you learned
about the final hours of Mr. Shackleford?
Squat.
No witnesses to the shooting.
His lawyer hasn't seen him
since he walked him out
of here this morning.
And the dog won't talk.
Maybe this will help.
The national ballistics database
got a hit on the bullet from Mims' body.
It came from a gun used in an armed
robbery in Florida 11 years ago.
Two perps tried to rob a liquor store
and got into a shootout with the clerk.
The perps got away, man and a woman.
There's a sketch of the man.
Mims.
The suspects fled the scene in a blue Nova.
Witnesses got half the
license plate... 3-4-delta.
Tango-3-8.
There was a blue Nova
parked outside the hotel
that Tara Sills and Sue Ellen were staying.
License plate 3-4-D-T-3-8.
You remember that?
It was parked in between a
yellow truck and a Mustang.
You want their tag numbers, too?
That Nova's in Texas,
owned by a guy in Luling.
Previous owner... Mims Shackleford.
You got an address?
No pinging needed.
Amazing.
It's c-a-r-o-l-i-n-a
them Carolina boyz
tell them, shorty, we don't play
The car we're looking for is blue.
It was blue, pops. Had it pimped out.
Did the kit myself.
Rules out getting prints.
You mean of Mims' female companion?
Yep.
That's where it was
I keep it locked down,
roll up on the spot now
You ever change out
the mirror on the visor?
No. Original equipment.
You ever go riding with
females... wife, girlfriend?
I keep it off the streets.
I like it cherry. You dig?
Tell them, shorty, we don't play
now, what's up, what's up, shorty?
You all flames and
you off the chains
and we just like to jump, jump
Try dusting for prints here.
You ever know a lady that didn't
check herself in the mirror?
Jump, jump, mister
I'll take her back to her
mama as soon as you're done.
I want to take her inside the house.
We're done.
Oh!
Thanks.
So, I've been thinking,
and my first choice is Florida State.
Wrong... you are not going to any college
where you have to pack a bikini.
You're going to a landlocked university.
Mom.
Okay, maybe on a lake.
It's them.
Just be cool.
Yeah. Yeah?
Got it.
Colt: So I find broken bottles
of Moonshine everywhere.
And this good old boy is standing there,
buck naked, with his pistol in one hand
and his pecker in the other.
You're lucky
neither one went off.
We got a hit on the print from the Nova.
- Female?
- Yep.
Tara Sills.
She was Mims' accomplice
in the Florida robbery.
So he followed her to Texas and killed her?
Falling out among thieves... classic.
So who killed Mims?
It's pretty clear the boy kept bad company.
Maybe another falling out among thieves?
No doubt.
You know, I think you're right.
I figured she'd come around.
- What was that?
- Exactly.
You want to tell me what we're doing?
Just pay attention.
Rangers, howdy.
I'm Bradley Tucker. How can I help you?
We just need to talk to your wife, sir.
Oh. Hey, there, Rangers. Did you, uh...
did you catch a break on the case?
Actually, we lost our best suspect.
Somebody killed Mims Shackleford.
Oh, my lord. That... that's horrible.
Yeah. We think it's the same
person who killed Tara Sills.
You mean... you
mean after all this time,
you still think that he's around?
I think so.
Do you recognize this man?
He's the one? I mean, you...
you think that he did it?
Have you seen him?
Uh...
I'm... I'm not sure.
You're not sure?
No, I ju... I just...
I can't say that I am.
Well, that is certainly unusual
because that was your father.
Sorry?
Well, it was Sue Ellen's father,
but you've never seen him
before, have you, Tara?
- What?
- Tara?
Oh, Bradley, just pay no mind.
They're just playing some sort of a trick.
She's Tara Sills?
Molly: Yep.
She met Sue Ellen on a bus to Texas
and saw a way out of
her own messed-up life.
All she had to do was kill Sue Ellen
and take over her life,
college scholarship and all,
Daughters of the Alamo.
I got your prints off that
picnic flyer you gave me.
They match Tara Sills.
Well, I'll be damned.
Your ex-boyfriend Mims helped
you get rid of the body,
and then you paid him to go away.
And when we got onto him,
you had to make sure he couldn't talk.
I... I want you away from my family now.
Oh, we're going.
Tara Sills, you're under arrest.
Son.
Ma'am, do you want to hand
that baby to your husband?
My baby?
But... I'm a good mother,
and I'm a good wife.
And I just... I've been living a good life,
the perfect life.
Killing Mims yesterday
kind of marred that record.
Sir.
Honey, what the hell is going on here?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
How did you know?
The body was dumped
in a place that would
make it unrecognizable,
so no one could I.D. it except
the new friend Sue Ellen.
When we had Mims on the ropes,
a lawyer Mims clearly wasn't
expecting bailed him out.
Whoever it was killed Tara
Sills didn't want Mims talking.
And who was around from
back then but Sue Ellen,
the girl with no parents who came to Texas
to start a new life?
The only question was who she really was.
I just needed to check her prints.
You must think I'm a right imbecile.
No. I don't.
I had that case inside out from day one.
Yeah, well, then you helped solve it.
I don't need the soft soap.
You had the license plate.
And then you said it was thieves
falling out, which it was.
Well, I guess I did help.
See you around, Ranger.
"Ranger"?
Just leave it.
It took a lot getting it out of me.
I remind you, Ranger Parker,
you remain under oath.
Mr. Franks, you ready to cross-examine?
You know what? Let me handle this.
Your Honor, Senator Colton
will be representing
himself today, as co-counsel.
Very well.
Jake: Thank you, Your Honor.
Good afternoon, Molly.
Senator Colton will
please address my client
as "Ranger Parker."
I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.
It's force of habit.
Ranger Parker...
You filed for divorce a long time ago.
How come you never mentioned
this so-called cruelty back then?
Fear.
Oh, come on. A Texas Ranger afraid of me?
Not afraid of you. Afraid of embarrassment.
Oh.
As an officer of the law,
you're familiar with police reports?
Yes.
I mean, when someone
is a victim of a crime,
- they report it, right?
- Generally.
So now you're saying that you're a victim.
So, can we get a look at
these reports that you filed?
I never did.
Oh.
Well, maybe you got some
friends you confided in
that can tell us what you said
about these so-called
incidents back at the time.
I never told anyone.
Any photos of your injuries?
No.
So... no proof, no records,
just unsupported allegations.
As a law officer,
would you arrest somebody based on that?
I'd evaluate the
credibility of the witnesses.
You are a public figure
with every reason to conceal what you did.
I have nothing to gain by coming forth
except public humiliation
and my freedom from you.
You can't hide from the truth.
And, Your Honor, I am telling the truth.
Judge... there's nothing here.
Judge Garrity: Well, it
seems like he said/she said.
So, in the absence of
any actual evidence...
Mr. Orba, have you lost
interest in these proceedings?
No, Your Honor.
We may be able to break this impasse
by calling on two additional witnesses...
Ms. Diane Simmons and Maria de La Vega.
Mr. Franks: Can't see what good it'll do.
Ms. Parker just conceded
there are no witnesses.
Well, she wasn't aware of these.
But I can assure the court
that they can shed light on this case.
Very well.
- We'll hear that testimony.
- That won't be necessary.
You know, to spare my wife
any further embarrassments,
I'm withdrawing my objection
to her divorce petition.
I'm willing to sign the
final documents right now.
What was in that file?
Your now-ex-husband's past.
He's an abuser.
If he hit you, he hit other women, too.
I did some digging.
Found a couple of old
girlfriends he batted around.
And they're willing to testify?
I don't know. Never talked to them.
Jake doesn't know that.
Yeah, but he doesn't stay in touch.
Blackmail.
The good version.
You're free, Molly.
Thank you.
Sure.
I don't really know what else to say.
Just be happy.
You deserve it.
Really got to go. This case...
Hey.
Be safe.
You're a remarkable man.
Hey, listen, when El Diablo shows,
you drop back behind us, all right?
We'll move in.
Yeah? What if his guys start shooting?
Well, then, our sniper team's gonna engage,
and it's gonna be over real fast.
All right, hold on. Slow down. This is it.
You sure this is the place?
Right here. 7:00 is what they said.
These guys don't run late.
Hindsight is beautiful
but not so forgiving
-  the truth just follows and festers inside
- What's that?
-  You can choose just what you remember
- Oh, Billy. Billy.
But the truth gets lost
and found by your lies
the truth gets lost
and found by your lies
Oh, my God.
Molls!
What happened? Where's Lulu?
We don't know.
She wasn't here when
Becca came to pick her up.
Becca, what?
So, the coach said that Lulu
went outside to wait for me
just before I got here.
All we found was her backpack.
This was pinned to it.
It's El Diablo.
