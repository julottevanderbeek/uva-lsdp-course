What were you trying to say:

The Red Beard has done nothing

He said only a little
of a burned house.
So you ü w rden

Rune ...
Tomorrow we begin a new life.
We get up at 4:00 clock,
working in the mine until 8:00 Clock.
Then we patch up our patients.
Got questions?
Any questions to me

Mr. Flaunce, you know what they do.
K ö nnten you are looking for the woman.

Come not, Doctor?
No. The coachman needs me
and other patients.
Want to ride with us?
I have no horse.
Take mine.
You trust me?
And if I did not come back?
No matter where you go,

Which party do you ride?
- Find The Lost Lady.

Take good care of that, my property

Do not worry, I adjust to the fact
and also on the horse.
There's something!
She is not in here.
But there is a bag.
Yes, the bag seems to her to go ren ö

But she?
We no longer find alive.

- I ß wei, that was a thorn bush.
- Are you long for Dr. Frail?
- Not very long.
Then, you use.
Thank you.
I know the doctor about 5 years.
We then searched for gold.

It is not his real name.

He challenges force of death.
The other day he's going to one,

A miracle that he did

Why would he kill him?
One ä erz hlt the wildest stories.

He lived in a city

He is there a sch ö nes House

And one night
something happened in that house.
A man and a woman ...

And the doctor should

Frenchy, it promises you.
- Come here!
- Is she alive?
Yes, but it has hit them hard.
Come here. Look, how they

You do not want to let go.
It is more dead than alive.
There is not much
it ü brig remained.
But what is still there,
does not ü from bel.
This ought to
only be a compliment.
There's nothing to it.
Come on, we put them on a stretcher
and bring them to Stump Meadow.
I ride with Dr. Frail and ore ä chairs,
I found it.
Just see here.
It should be h ü bsch?
Hey! I've found it!

In the gorge.
I! She's alive!
I've found the woman doctor.
M ssen ü once you come too.
I have a patient here.
What makes the Red Anna with you?
She is waiting for death.
She did not die down there.
- The Lady sees it from ö b se.
- I'm coming as fast as I can.
- F Anna ü r k ö you can do anything.
- No, that has probably never done one.
But I'll leave it alone.
- How long will it take?
- 2 hours, I think.
Should I turn around her neck,
make it faster?
No, doctor, no.
I say nothing.
I have done my duty,
Their you do if you'd like to m ö.
Glad you're here, Doctor.
She lies dr ben ü.

Well, that was right.

It occurred to anyone,

I need a lot of clean water.
Where the water bottles empty.
You always talks to her father.
He is killed when berfall Ü.
- How hot ß t they?
- Elizabeth Mahler.
That's my water bottle, doctor.
Whining
She has severe burns
and Gehirnersch ü tterung.
Perhaps internal injuries.
It is probably blind.
- You will never see again can k ö?
- I can not say yet.
It was probably the whole day
unconscious in the sun.
- First, they need time to get out.
- We ask the trapper to the car.
We still have a small house,
against ü ber of baby's.
Then k ö nnten bring them.
N Sch ö, I'll get the car.
Do you have enough water, Doctor?
Yes. Put it beside the stove,
We ü m ssen it boil.
And you, do that, you get out.
Doctor, you will not have time,
to st ä ndig mmern to them k ü.
When I had finished the housework
and her man
bring the food must ...
The m ö chte I love to do.
Well, Rune. Thank you.
Hey, boy!
What need of all the water?
He has to wash them, yes.
Ü berall?
The z ä not yet selected, to a doctor.
You've found it!
You've found it!
It should be migrated quite fresh.
Wom ö so resembled a loose woman.
What does this have to do with it? It is
a stranger here, blind, and severely wounded.
Dr. Frail? My husband has given you
rashly offered to our house.
- You will not die here.
- You will not die.
They will live, Ms. Mahler.
It'll get better.
We are ü ber den Berg.
They  hnt

- Wir m ssen ü down again, come.
Take the L to the ä.
The space must remain obscured.
Elizabeth. K ö can you understand me?
The coach was berfall ü.
The horses have bolted.
- But now you're safe.
- I need to ü ck. My father ...

I have found some tea.
Do it in the pot.

Why is it lt blo ß ä h

If you through so much h ä ttest,

Only half awake.

She needs rest.
It d ü rfen no strangers to her.
Bring the bell above the entrance to ü,

- Is that all, Mr. Flaunce?
- More gold, we have not found.
- The vein of gold seems to be the exhaustion.

Here in the area is no one

Good morning, Rune.
Where did you get the horse from?
The doctor took it in payment.
He l ä sst ask

I have saved you, ck 3 St ü.
How is our beauty Sch ö?
She now sits on the 1.Mal,

We will soon know
where we are with her.
It was a b ö ser winter.
My mother died this year.
My father said:
''Come, let us emigrate.
In a country
which offers us a new future.''
Oh, it was wonderful.
The train to St. Louis.
Then the river steamer
the Missouri River and up.
And then the coach ü about the mountains
and wide across the steppes.
A wonderful country
just as in our ä umen Tr.
''And now,''said my father,
''Elizabeth, now we ü m ssen
Find the right place''.
Did you think
Here w ä re the right place?
If I can see again,

It sweeps away the first Windsto ß,

And you, Doctor Frail?
How do you like?
Rune? The slightly cross-eyed

And the doctor has
a gray beard and no teeth Z ä.

Rune is certainly a Bscher h ü boy.
By Dr. Frail I can

I only know of his H ä nde.
They are tanned by the sun

And terribly long legs he has.
He's coming in 3 steps to a T ü r.

Only the good old Frenchy,

I was the one you drau ß s

I wanted to ask if I

Excuse me,

Yes. He has now.

Excuse me. Thank you.
Good day.
Rune has told me
how helpful they were.
Glad
that you are healthy again.
Thank you.
I m ö chte one Minenausr ü pation.
Excuse me?
Rune and I
want to go fossicking.
I see.
Fits for the f r ü a woman?
- I'm still there.
- I f rchte ü hard work is not.
W ü you rden me
then a Ausr ü pation borrow?
It is very valuable,
one Familienerbst ü ck.
The stones are really very rare.
This is an exciting St ü ck.
I have a magnifying glass in the apartment.
Do you have any objection
n ä me when I look at her?
Nat ü rlich not. Please.
- Doctor, she wants a Minenausr ü pation.
- I thought so.
She wants to borrow money then.
This should be an old Erbst ü ck.
Do you think
That is more than $ 20 worth?
Tell her that you are her
umen an open credit Einr ä.
All right, Doctor.
If you daf ü r underwrite.
Well?
Your Frenchy was not lying!
Give me the money
and it can go to work.
No, first
We discuss the events ä products.
It's embarrassing, with a lady
Done ä ü ber fte speak.
- Mr. Plante, we get down to business.
- Substance.
To the point.
What do you think of 20%?
Gro ß z ü giger as I can be.
I can at any time Ausr ü pation
get to 5 or 10%.
Why do you do it then?
No, 20% is too little.
We want 50%.
- The k ö you can accept or ...
- Reject.
Yes, or reject it.
- 50%.
- 50%.
Because you are.
Here's my hand on it.
No, first we go to Mr. Flaunce
and make the contract.
And then we shake hands.
Agreed?
''... erkl ä ren to indemnify,
that if one partner
in the above-referenced Mine
ckziehen from work to ü will ... ''
Brrrrrrr!
I catch the groove
up there at the waterfall at
and f ü them down hre
behind the tree in the creek.
I'll beat the sh ü Geb.
Well, the proud owner of mine?
Sit down there in the shade.
Frenchy does everything alone.
I will participate as you are.
Please consider me as a man
That will not be easy.
A better verbal ä EMPLOYMENT f ü r lts
H ä hands will help you cause.
Well, you are 'ne number, you know.
They are really 'ne dolle number.
Go up
and f ä lle wood f ü r the gutter.
Rune! Rune!
Go up to the water!
So now we are ready
to wash the sand.
Down with the water!
K ö Now we can begin to dig.
Now we de rei ß Earth
the gold from the body,
here
lies hidden for millions of years.
Whoever gets the child?
The wife of Russell.
How I know she wants to 4 dozen
Diapers. Since we prefer to take 12 m.
Tell me, have Flaunce, you
which go from the river above ö rt?
Do you have some nostalgia?
No, I just wanted to know
how's ben since ü dr.
- The mine is in operation.
- With Success?
Not likely.
Only 5 ounces to 3 weeks.
That hardly covers the interest.
It takes time.
It has
f ü r ü about $ 1,000 of goods taken.
- And I will continue to give her credit?
- Yes.
- Even if nothing comes out?
- Even if I lose every penny.
It is indeed nothing to me, Doctor.
When Done ä ftsmann I do not understand
how do you come to Their Costs.
I am not an event ftsmann ä and
therefore accountable to no one.
Thank you
the matter be kept confidential.
Not even my wife wei ß them.
I promised Russell
I watch him think.
He was probably more scared than his wife.
M ä Men are funny.
How many M ä male by their wives
the G ä ngelband let f hren ü.
The k ü rzeste ü way is via the comb
and then along the river, Doctor.
MINE LUCKY LADY''''
OWNER: E. MAHLER, F. PLANTE, RUNE
In about one months ü
we have found almost nothing.
I'm just not ü Gl ck.
- We have ü m ssen patience.
- Patience is something I have not.
Good day, Doctor. I am pleased
that you can look at times.
I visited a patient.
- M ö you'd like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
Do not tell a doctor weight ö hnlich:
''How are you? ''
And:''You see once your tongue''?
I see how you feel.
Is it me good?
- Show me nde Their H ä.
- They're dirty.
Maybe I should ask
how are you?
Come stop by on occasion.
I'll give you what f ü r lts H ä nde.
Thank you, Doctor.
Lucky Lady''''.
Have Eq ü ck?
No, but a little bit of hope
can not hurt.
How is Rune?
They are missing two of us.
What do you want?
Spying on us?
What's the matter,
what he can not see?
Well, Rune?
To work, Rune!
Ren you go ö only 50% of this hole.
I will certainly
not more than 50% dirt digging.
Why do not we cut the crap go?
Do it all. But then
ö go mine rune and my rt.
My share k ö nnt have it cheap.
And why ü w rde Mr. Plante
so much money vorschie ß s,
if he does not believe in the mine?
Why you must ü m
Watch a woman like that?
If a partner is not certain rights?
So take a look but does not hurt.
You have to be well doctor
in order to rfen the d ü.
As you probably nnte k ö
allow even more.
You really are a tough old boot.
But wait a minute.
That's better than nothing.
Rune!
I walk into the village.
I m ö chte that you come with me.
K ö you can stay calm here.
It happens you nothing.
See you tomorrow, Frenchy.
From today I'm going at night
stay down in the village.
I come here just to work.
I have the plague, eh?
The plague.
For a moment,
I'll just change.
Good evening.
Good evening, Mrs. Flaunce.
Our vorr ä te come to an end.
I ask for an advance or
my needle.
Their Unsch ä tzbare needle!
The sack of potatoes is not worth it.
Excuse me, what do you think?
I've seen lhr account register.
The needle
ä h tte I have borrowed a penny.
- What do you want?
- Do not play the innocent.
So you know: Dr. Frail
has advanced to you the money.
K ö us we can well imagine
She told him how to ckzahlen ü.
I have it in black and white ß:
$ 1119, you were worth it so far.
Running up like a whore!
L ü gnerin. Common wrong queue.
One should trample you.
At some point, somehow
I pay every penny for ü ck.
- What you pay for ü ck?
- I was in the shop.
Mrs. Flaunce says you made me think.
They even called me a whore.
That was not my intention.
I'm sorry.
- Better to leave the city.
- Do not meddle in my life!
Who gives you the right to
playing with people's lives like that?
Drag the people themselves
and sto s ß them out.
- Gef ä it llt you, len people ä qu?
- Not at all.
But you qu ä len us!
Rune just like me.
- Life is political once r ä.
- Maybe it already has.
Then it is true
what one ä erz hlt.
- From the woman who killed herself.
- Yes, that's true.
I was married to this woman.
And the man was my brother.
I have no right to forget.
M ö you'd like me more erz hlen ä?
This is a tincture from plants ö l.
I have you f ü r produced.
It will heal Their H ä nde
gardens and at the same time surveilance ä.
I'm at the end! I'm ready!
I can not stand it any longer.
But what we have found
but must come from somewhere!
Somewhere, yes! This is probably
of the Flood ü brig remained.
What is it?
The whole earth is moving!
Caution, the tree!
Rune!
- Rune!
- Here I am.
- This is gold!
- What is it?
Gold.
The roots of the tree
have held it.
Where are you?
The freeze is in Tr ü mmer gone.
Where are you?
What are you doing in that hole?
Look.
A miracle.
Here, here. In the tree.
