Ain't no one here.
Keep it down!
Dang.
What the hell?
Cost me a week's income.
Don't you know hens?
You go and wake them,
sudden, like that... they won't lay!
You want eggs?
- Are you the sheriff?
- Are you President McKinley?
Now what does it look like.
We ain't got any sheriff here.
We ain't got nothing.
It all belongs to McGowan.
Say, what's that smell in the air?
That delicate odor also
belongs to McGowan.
It's from the silver mine...
...which is McGowan's, of course.
Where's a town with a marshal in it?
I have a reward to collect.
You could try and make it to
Cassidy...
...but with this downpour,
I sure don't advise it.
Is there someplace here
to bed down in?
The bunkhouse. It's for the miners.
First you got to get permission
from McGowan.
You ain't ever gonna get it.
Where is this McGowan?
You take a dozen eggs.
They will be nice with
coffee in the morning...
...on the trail to Cassidy!
Good night.
It's awful late you know.
You don't want your hens up
all night long.
Where is McGowan?
He lives on the hill west of town...
...but the one you want to see
is his watchdog, Voller.
He'll be in the drugstore.
Thank you, my friend.
I'll take 3 cards.
- Two.
- One.
Where's Voller?
- Huh?
- Voller.
- He's asking for Voller.
- What do you want him for?
He's busy at the moment
and doesn't want to be disturbed.
You can talk to me.
I'm looking for somewhere
for us to bunk down for the night.
You boys walk in a place and
people see you dripping mud...
...like a couple of pigs, you can't
expect them to offer their beds.
I'd like to buy my new friend a beer.
And, this one.
He's had a long walk.
We don't serve any alcohol in here
after midnight.
And, everyone always obeys
the rules.
Except at cards.
That's too rich for my blood.
I'm out.
Cost you 5,000 to stay in now.
That's a lot of pressure you're
putting on me, Voller.
You're not getting my silver,
too. Fold.
You've got the damndest luck
I ever seen. The pot is yours.
I'm through trying to beat you.
Then, move over.
I'll play you for 5,000 dollars.
Okay, amigo.
But first, I want to see your
That's it over there.
You just bring him to a marshal.
Is this some kind of joke?
If so, it's funny to your friend only.
We don't pick up tabs around here.
So I hear.
This is a peaceful place.
Doesn't it look like it to you?
These people are upstanding
and honest.
And all hard-working employees
of McGowan...
...until they die of dust poisoning
in the mines.
Who are you?
Those that know me call me Blade...
...because I got a habit of
letting this do my talking for me.
What do you want?
To try my luck with your
pack of cards.
Fine.
Let's play.
Sorry, I don't like poker.
You what?
Let's just play high-card-to-win.
You pick one first.
Nine.
Ten.
Let's go double or nothing.
No.
As you might have guessed,
I know other languages.
Keep dropping it real easy...
...or you won't be as lucky
as your dogs.
Your feet will really stink
when you take your boots off.
So what?
So 5,000 dollars is what I wanted,
not your smell.
Go on, get out of here, Craven.
Come again?
Hit the trail.
You son of a bitch,
letting me go like this.
You're the most goddamn,
unpredictable bastard I know!
Don't waste your breath.
You might want to run...
...because when I need money again...
They'll be coming.
They couldn't scare me off.
Quit dragging your feet!
Move that cart along!
Move it along, move it!
I sure hope we don't run into
Dolman's bunch, again.
My men know a trail that swings north of
where Dolman's been operating.
They'll take you to Selma Springs.
You'll be okay from there.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
Don't forget to come back!
Bring back Irish pipes from Selma.
Let's go.
I can't read, Dolman, but I can guess!
Who are you?
What do you want?
An awful lot of people have been
asking me that, lately.
Where's your father?
Stop right where you are.
Get your hands up.
Up to the hat.
Debra, I'll handle this.
This would never, ever
go through her...
...then, we'd both feel silly.
That pistol won't be necessary,
McGowan.
Who are you?
Some day we'll get around to that.
I'm here tonight about prices.
Prices?
You pay 2,000 dollars a week...
...I'll be your straw boss.
You have imagination.
It would be worth improving
your defenses.
With Dolman gobbling up your silver
as fast as you can mine it...
...the McGowan empire won't
last too long.
I already employ a whole army to
defend the empire.
It's a poor battle commander that
won't do a little observation.
A fatal mistake.
You still got time to make Suttonville...
...before I have Voller give
something else to his dogs for dinner.
You were given
the wrong information...
...because we've reached an
understanding, his dogs and I.
Think it over, McGowan.
Just stand there and
let the fella walk out?
Hey! Pig-Sty!
My friends would like to see how
you can make out with these.
I got no guns.
Take off your guns, boys.
My blessings.
They are all yours.
Stop it.
That's enough!
You'll pay for this,
you son-of-a-bitch.
I'd say we done pretty good.
Yeah, let's go.
Hold it.
If we don't bring his carcass back,
Voller will think we're just faking it.
Come on.
We're almost there.
You've been saying that
for the last two days.
Johnny, look over there.
Pop used to say that dead men
on a pile of stones are best left alone.
I'm turning us around.
No, wait.
Where you going?
Angela! It could mean trouble.
Why do you wanna get
mixed up in this?
One of them is still alive.
Come on!
I'm sorry, McGowan...
...but if you can't guarantee
your consignment of silver...
...we'll be forced to shift the contract
to Virginia City come June.
But if bandits attack the wagons
every time, how can I...
...guarantee it?
It's up to the Treasury Department
to send me proper escorts for them.
Army Secretary Fiske has complained
you've cost him too many men...
...and that's not part of
the contract.
It says you have full responsibility
as far as Fort Riley, Texas...
...and it also provides funds to hire
men to protect those shipments.
Where are they?
Now we're doing all that's
possible...
...but this bandit Dolman,
he's got a lot of men.
- He's well organized.
- I understand that.
All I can do is ask the army
to let you have more guards.
Beyond that, it's your problem.
- I'll keep in touch.
- Right, and thanks.
Voller.
I don't believe I've got the strength
to go on with this work.
I've begun to have visions of
my tombstone.
- McGowan, come on.
- I know what I'm saying.
But that's not what I'd like to
discuss with you.
Debra has never fit in with
dust poison.
No, I... I feel I should send her to
New Orleans...
...to learn how to be a lady.
Will you take her there?
Sure.
I'll join her as soon as
I've wrapped things up here.
All of a sudden, the empire
smells very cold.
You know the smell?
- Well, we're almost finished.
- We'll be right up.
Well, peekin' at women again,
already, are you?
When we found you, we thought
you'd never pull through.
Let's see the leg.
What's the matter with it?
Oh, nothing much, considering
your constitution.
Nothing but a huge gaping hole...
...which I am about to try to
sew up. Now then.
Are you a Quaker?
Who? A Quaker? Me?
All those women out there...
aren't they married to you?
Married? Married?!
If I had married 5 women like that...
...you'd be looking at the world's
most cuckolded husband!
Those women are my capital.
If it hurts you too much, here...
...it's not the best of brands, but
it'll do the trick.
Are you gonna...
That's right. Sew your leg up...
...unless you prefer
to get gangrene?
Ah, so, you're a doctor.
Not actually. I used to be a
women's tailor.
Of course, if you object...
Only if you put on buttons.
It was a perfect trap. There
shouldn't have been any problem.
You might have thought of
telling me before.
Maybe they ran into something
unexpected, and didn't want to rush it.
Only, somebody would be back
by now to get help.
Tell Billy Worm and Tabby
to saddle up.
Without his horse, the dude
ain't gone far.
Let's go.
Hold it!
This wagon must have turned around
less than 6 hours ago!
Follow the tracks!
That's it! Up higher!
Gotta let them see it.
Hey you! What are you
doing on this trail?
We were on our way toward
Cassidy...
...but halfway up, the pass was
blocked by a rockslide.
So, we came back this way
and set up camp.
You ain't, by any chance,
seen any strays in the pass?
I would have been delighted to.
The ladies are burning up
to show their talents.
Gonna take over a saloon in
Weston...
...but it's hard to keep hot chicken
simmering forever!
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
It's a great disappointment
to me that...
...we have no time to savor the
delights of your spectacle.
You know, if there's some other
trail we could take?
I'm not at all acquainted
with these parts...
...and we sure do want to
get to Weston.
Now who are you hiding in your
wagon over there?
No one, sir.
Why the guns?
Wait a minute!
Stop it, please! My wagon,
you're destroying it!
It will take weeks to repair it!
What did I do to deserve this?
Look what you've done to this hat,
you stupid simpletons!
It was a brand new, original
from Paris!
Cost me all of 64 dollars in
New Orleans!
Who's gonna pay me
for my hat?!
Shut that squawker's mouth,
and look inside the wagon.
The dogs can't be wrong!
But you can't do this!
We're not hiding anything!
There's nothing, only clothes!
Unless he's in the walls.
Stupid dogs.
Let's go.
You see?
Worked like a charm!
It only cost 5 dollars.
I bought it in Bitter Creek...
...but you're gonna get me a new one.
None of that.
You may be handsome...
...but you're just as rotten
as every other man.
Soon as I'm better, we're
going to Suttonville.
I have a hankering to do
some dancing.
Suttonville?! Are you crazy?
That bigot McGowan won't allow
dancers inside the city limits.
Don't worry, I'll get you a
special permit.
Take the dogs and search the
other end of the pass.
He's got to be around here
somewhere.
I'm heading back to town!
Mr. Voller?
The stage just pulled in.
Are you ready?
Let's get those bags loaded.
Get back on the stage.
It's about to start.
Passengers have a right to
an hour's rest!
Around here, we decide the
passengers' rights.
At least let me go take a piss.
No, we're leaving.
Get in. Go on.
No need to push us around.
You ought to be thankful
Mr. McGowan is providing an escort...
...for the rest of the journey to
protect you.
Go on.
And here we go.
Let's hear it!
It's Johnny-Johnny
and his ballet Parisienne!
Hey, it's the ballet Parisienne!
For the first time west of the
Mississippi...
...you'll see the famous dance
of the garters!
It's as good a place as any other...
...if you can get them to let us stay.
They will let you stay.
Looks like they haven't seen
a woman since the Flood.
I travel the southwest
route twice a year...
...but I'll be darned if I've ever seen
a trail as rough as this one.
What do you say, Miss?
Think maybe we ought to change
lines in Dallas?
Yeah, and maybe a long time
before then...
...and you can rest assured
I'll make my voice heard.
I have never been treated so
ungallantly and thoughtlessly in my life.
Protest as much as you please...
...but they're traveling a
different trail for a reason.
This whole area is infested
with bandits.
Good Lord!
Outlaw hooligans?!
Voller, how long is it to the
next way station?
Many a mile, Miss.
You people care for a nip of rum?
- No thank-you.
- Imported from the Isle of Jamaica!
End of the line, friends!
Oh, God!
Shuck the hardware,
grab a cloud.
You four! Move away from
the stage!
What are you, a fool?!
I want you all out, your hands up high,
over your head, where I can see them.
Relieve this gent of his irons.
Come on!
Out!
Don't murder me.
Stop making such a fuss!
Out!
Move it.
Come on!
Last but not least,
Edward McGowan's only daughter!
It's better you eliminate them all.
Looks like rain.
All right, let's go.
All right, the show's over!
You tramps get off the stage!
Shut your mouth and do what
you're told. Mr. McGowan's orders!
Let my girls go, damn it!
Leave them alone!
Give 20 lashes to each one of
these sinners and shave their heads.
May the good Lord on high
drive out the spawn of Satan!
Start with that one, howling
like a demon.
What demon?!
You're the real demon,
whipping these innocent girls!
Let me get them out of town.
We'll never come back.
Get back and keep quiet!
Go get him!
Idiots! lmbeciles!
You got 28 guns against one!
Get him!
Call them off.
Bandits... The bandits...
They took your daughter.
Is it Voller?
Where is she?
Have a look.
It's hard to recognize her
way up there.
Give him the glass.
You can tell Voller that
I'm willing to pay whatever he wants.
Voller?
Voller. I'm not so old and not so
stupid not to have seen right away...
...that this was set up by Voller.
No need to rush it.
Not for that much money.
You got plenty of time to put together
everything you own and...
...all the silver your men can mine.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get on with that loading!
Move! Come on!
Let's go, let's go!
You're a bunch of lazy idlers!
You've got to earn your wages.
Hurry up. Move it!
Hurry up. Move it. Cut down the trees!
You can't! You can't do this.
This is my land!
My land now!
- Get off of it!
- You get off!
Get off my land!
Let's get started.
Cut down all these trees.
Your help is the last thing I want,
but I don't have any choice now.
Let's hear a price.
Ten times that.
That's totally unreasonable!
Look at that ore they're taking out.
That's just to meet their demands.
I gave up deliveries to Fort Riley and
I'm losing my government contract!
So be it. But I want you to get my
child back, safe and sound.
If you fail...
I ain't finished.
I was told that years ago
the air around here was clean...
...and life was easy and carefree.
And worth nothing.
I changed all that and
it belongs to me now.
What else do you want?
Allow my friend, Johnny-Johnny,
to set up here in Suttonville...
...and re-open the saloon.
It will give these poor souls
something to look forward to.
Re-open the saloon? These men
have got to stick to working...
...and not be distracted with
disgusting spectacles of Babylon.
You're not pushing us out.
This land is my land!
It's mine now.
On the beginning of
Judgement Day...
...there won't be anyone in line
before you, McGowan.
The shows we're gonna put on!
They will come from all over.
Look at that sign. Not even the
Pecos House in Dallas...
...has a sign like that.
Hey there, Shorty! Hey, listen!
How about him in a frilly outfit?
See ya later! Got to work.
We've still got the whole second
floor to clean. It's going great.
Let's go, girls.
Right on upstairs.
It's been Johnny-Johnny's dream
to own his own place...
...and now he's finally got one.
What is your great dream?
I don't dream any longer, but you know,
every now and then...
...I think, if I had a lot of money,
I would go away to Paris...
...or London or whatever.
What I mean is, I'd just travel
wherever I wanted to.
And then what?
Come back home?
I know I shouldn't ask you.
Will you stay?
Who can tell?
I can't bet on covered cards.
drive a hard bargain.
And all of that there is for Debra.
You're to follow the back trail into
high country.
They'll show up when they see fit,
but stay on the look out.
They wanted me to go.
Unfortunately I'm no longer able to...
...defend myself,
much less my daughter.
But I'm not looking for your sympathy.
Your wealth can get you anything
with a price on it.
Men even die for it.
But it can't buy you the one thing
you've never had.
Human kindness.
Do you mind telling me just
what your real name is?
To a man with your amount of
conscience, I doubt if it will ring bells.
The name I was born to is buried
in a wood grove with my dead father.
Are you the son of...
Gerald Merton?
Yeah.
How do you feel?
Pa! Papa!
Gerald! Gerald!
With his wife and son here...
Go on, get them out of there.
It was an accident.
It wasn't me.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
Yes, it was.
You stole the land, remember?
No! I bought that land,
under territorial concession.
And destroyed a man in doing so.
Gerald Merton refused to bend
with the movement of progress.
The minerals under your father's land
enrich the world.
Especially you.
Your minerals have brought greed,
disease, and filth.
Just look at the miners.
All right, kill me.
Blow my head off if you think
that's going to avenge your father.
But I warn you,
you've got the wrong enemy.
I know I do.
But you're finished,
McGowan.
For 20 years, my only dream was
to face you down and kill you...
...for what you did to my father.
And you know...
...you're not worth the brass of my
The worst punishment now is
for you to have to live on.
Now, you listen to me.
I don't need your forgiveness
or your pity.
I only want you to kill...
to kill your and my enemy.
Voller.
It's Voller you've got to kill.
He kidnapped Debra.
He's a bloodthirsty madman...
...he wants the empire,
and I can't prevent it!
Only you can stop him now.
I'm afraid...
...afraid of what he might do to Debra.
You have to save her.
Since when have you been
working for McGowan?
Got to make a living.
You can let Debra go now.
The ransom money is here.
Don't tell me the old fool has forgot.
He was supposed to come and
pick up his pretty daughter.
- Not you.
- What's the difference?
What counts is that you get
your pot of gold...
...and that Debra returns to Suttonville.
Put down the gun as well.
Come on. It's like having
no britches on.
Let's take it rough.
I always stick to bargains.
Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
I'll let the girl go,
you get your ass away from my gold.
No!
Go on, now.
You don't know much about women,
do you, big boy?
Why did you have to get
mixed up in all this?
It's just a family affair.
Hey, Voller!
Ain't nothing but rocks!
He's right.
That paralytic old gold eater.
Don't be stupid. My father
would never cheat on a deal.
That's not a very nice thing
to do to me.
Take back the girl and
run off with my gold.
Where did you hide it?
You better kill me.
You better kill me while you can.
Or some day I'll get you.
Voller, I think I know how to
make him change his mind.
- The party's over!
- Bust the place apart!
Get out of here!
Let me go!
Angela!
Please, she hasn't done anything.
Johnny-Johnny!
What the hell have you done
to him, bastards?!
Hey, Pig-Sty!
Now look who we've got here.
Ain't she a pretty, little
sweetheart?
I only hope she can help you
bring back your memory.
Now, do you want to save
your hero or not?
Do you want to save him?
All you have to do is get him to say
where he has hidden my gold.
Leave her be.
I'll show you where I've hidden it.
But you have to let her go,
first, with a headstart.
All that's left is to say,
"Good-bye"...
...because he and I got another
score to settle, see?
Angela, get out of here.
No, I can't do it.
You're not going to die. You can't.
- Don't be a fool.
- No.
- If you stay, he will kill us both.
- No.
Now that poor Johnny is dead,
you're my whole world.
Okay, let's go.
We've wasted enough time already.
If she's so set on it,
she can come, too.
You saved us the trouble of
digging your grave.
See the sun?
That's gonna be your damnation.
I've reserved the slowest end for you,
my little heart could think of.
You trash.
You bastard!
I'll tear your eyes out!
Worthless whore.
God damn you. I'll kill you.
That will do.
Can't you close your eyes?
Then, golly, I just hope a
scorpion gets you...
...before the sun burns them out.
Adios, amigo.
Debra! Debra.
He'll tell you the whole story.
You're getting old, McGowan.
Finished.
Why don't you move over and
leave a place for me?
I want you to give your blessings
to our imminent betrothal.
If I ever get you out of there alive,
remember...
...Burt Craven never forgets.
Go on! They're all waiting.
There. Climb aboard.
Get going, and don't ever come back.
That's the way to clean up a town.
Now, it's time for a little
law and order in this place...
...seeing that both McGowan and I
feel it's necessary.
Now, owing to infirmity,
the old man desires that...
...I replace him in the management
of the mine...
...and the administration of Suttonville.
And I'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you all...
...Miss Debra and I are shortly
to be married.
Is it night yet?
No, it's still light outside.
I better go out there and hunt for
something to sink our teeth into...
...before it gets dark.
See what easy women do to you?
Turns you into softies.
What did I say? On your feet!
I said, "On your feet!"
Leave him alone,
son-of-a-bitch.
Now I got something to say.
Old McGowan was a hard man
to work under...
...but you've pushed it too far.
Are you out of your mind?
Put the shovel down.
Either you stop treating us
like a herd of animals or...
...you'll mine the silver yourself.
- Amen.
- You can't treat us like mules.
Let that be an example to you all.
Now get back to work!
Let's show him we ain't scared of him.
Come on!
This is your last warning.
We will not tolerate any further
insubordination, and...
...we do not accept any of your
requests or complaints.
Now either you all return to work
immediately...
...or I give the order to my men
to open fire on you.
Voller.
You won't gain any power
simply by forcing them.
Don't fire.
Fire!
I tried looking at daylight again today.
Nothing.
Don't worry, you'll get your sight back
even if it does take a long time.
Why is it you're playing
nursemaid?
You once saved my life,
don't you remember?
I also cut off your hand.
Yeah, well, now I've got one
made of steel...
...and twice as strong as before.
Anyhow, let's forget this goddamn
sad talk and drink up...
...and quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know something?
It's a whole new world
when you go blind.
You see things
you never saw before.
We got to have the blasted horses
changed, right?
So, we wait in this dump.
How can you stand living in this
God-forsaken rathole?
Until a couple of weeks ago,
you couldn't even get whiskey here.
Hey, buck-a-roo. How about offering me
a little whiskey, huh?
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, it's awful.
I wasn't born with this goddamn hook.
A son-of-a-bitch hacked it off
with a hatchet.
I remember when you came in.
The man called Blade.
I don't think Blade will be chopping off
any more hands.
Oh, yeah?
Well, Blade is still alive.
He'll be back, looking for blood.
And where is he?
Right now, he's like a wounded animal,
but he's healing fast.
Answer my question.
Where is he?
Depends on how much
your boss wants to pay.
Now, I only wish I could be
with you for this.
These boys are the best.
If you're playing straight, they'll get him.
If not, you're gonna need at least
You don't have to worry about a thing.
He's blind and unarmed. It'll be easy.
We'll be back tomorrow with
his head on a stick.
Okay fellas, go on.
He's over there in that cave.
I'll wait here.
I can't see a damn thing in here.
You two go ahead.
We'll cover your backs.
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead.
Go on!
Go on!
Where the hell are you,
you son-of-a-bitch?
Burt Craven, I know you're here.
You told me you were blind.
You said you couldn't look into the sun.
You bastard, you lied!
Talking about seeing things different.
You were lying.
I was warning you about how I saw
through everything you were saying.
It's time. Draw!
Draw.
Voller! Where are you?
I've come to kill you.
I'm here for you.
Double or nothing.
Come on out. Show yourself,
if you got the guts.
I'm right here in front of you.
No!
No!
Hey, mister.
A couple of eggs
will go good on the trail.
