Previously on
AMC's "Hell on Wheels..."
The railroad comes first.
That's all we got, you and me.
I have a wife.
Our schemes have left
us with no friends.
You need Mickey.
I was hoping for more
of a fight from you.
is not going to make for
a very exciting finish.
I would be
within reason to fire you.
Not if you
aim to win this race.
Get us through that tunnel quick.
I thought you not come back.
Gotta get to work.
MEI: What happen?
Long story.
But that's over for now.
It's dangerous to be doing this.
I know.
I gave you boys damn near a
month to finish this thing.
Well, looky here, just when I
was starting to get lonesome.
CULLEN: Jim.
- Heard you found your family.
- I did.
Thought you were gone.
I ain't.
Since I got back, alone,
from Salt Lake City,
we've had three shifts working 24 hours
on all four faces of this tunnel.
And still, every single day we fall
further and further behind Durant,
thanks to your disobedience.
So unless you have thoughts on
some way out of this morass,
you can pack your things, get
the hell off my mountain.
Got more than thoughts.
- Fong. Get these boxes up to the summit.
- MEI: Hm.
Unload these boxes
and get them to the tunnel.
Nitroglycerin?
Got to speed up the work, Jim.
Not this way. Shit's dangerous as hell.
- Put that down!
- Mr. Strobridge...
God... I said put that
down right now, Bohannon.
It's leaking.
See?
You ordered all these chemicals.
You don't have the Goddamnedest
idea how to use 'em.
I thought that's what I had you for.
You know I'm not a chemist.
I know you experimented
with nitro in '65.
Experimented and discontinued its use.
It's too dangerous for my tunnel.
Well, it's my tunnel now.
Mr. Bohannon.
- Glad you're back.
-
- Go!

Jim, will you slow the hell down?
It ain't safe.
Workin' on the railroad ain't safe.
I just need you to mix the first batch.
And I need the Chinamen trained.
Nitroglycerin is by nature unstable.
That's why its components are
shipped in separate crates.
And how many Jakes are
you willing to sacrifice
until you find the one with
the finesse to handle it?
We'll train in off-shifts,
we'll find the most skilled.
- We'll ease it over in the next few days.
- Christ, Bohannon.
You're gonna have a
bloodbath on your hands.
Not with your help, I won't.
Just one batch, Jim.
That's all I'm askin'.
The man who taught me this
was Scottish, if you believe it.
Worked for a blasting
company in San Francisco.
Made gallons of the stuff down there.
But the Sierras are
high, over 6,000 feet.
The air's thinner up here.
What's the temperature?
- Fifty five.
- Up here, you've to stay below 60.
One degree more, you start a chain
reaction you can't stop. What's it now?
Fifty seven.
Here.
At sea level, you can let
it get all the way to 65.
That's what the bagpiper was used to.
He made a dozen batches before
he realized his mistake.
He disappeared into a red mist.
That's the last thing
my left eye ever saw.
Hm?
Fifty nine.
Yeah.
Every breath you take with this in
your hand, is a challenge to God.
You take the canister
out of the box,
keeping the fuse up
and the blasting cap out
of the nitroglycerin.
Then you're gonna slide
it down into the hole.
And then, you lower the blasting
cap into the nitroglycerin.
And then, gently, bend it
over the side of the rock.
And then fill it with wet sand.
And now, you attach the fuse.
Get yourself a little slack.
A lot of guys only twist three times.
But I like to twist four.
Why did we wait so long to do this?
Because I'm a gentleman,
I would never presume.
You're such a bastard
of business, New York.
Fast-talking and ruthless. Ugh.
Pardon the expression, but you're the
one who's gotten into bed with me.
How could I help myself?
- You could charm the skin off a snake.
-
Besides, there's somethin'
about you when we're alone.
It's something good.
Marry me.
Oh, don't talk foolish.
Railroads, leaving
Wyoming, soon you with it.
Besides, now that Cheyenne
is the official hub,
I have to get back to my hotel.
Hire a girl, and marry me.
There is no man livin'
I would rather marry, New York.
But it's a racket. I've tried it.
Besides, I would rather hang
on to my hard-fought assets.
- Thank you very much.
- I don't want your hotel, I want you.
I had promised myself I'd never
walk down the aisle again.
But I will hire a girl and accompany
you to the end of the line,
if you make me one promise.
Name it.
No more schemes.
-
- Mmm-mmm.
Cheatin' people, it leaves a bad taste.
It is in the nature of the
lion to eat the zebra.
- Come back to bed.
- Promise me.
All right, I promise.
Thomas,
promise me.
I promise.
What the hell is that?
A herd of zebra.
Gentlemen!
What is the meaning of this?
Frontier's justice, Mr. City Slicker.
You may have got a slippery tongue
but that don't make me bullet-proof.
What exactly is it that you want?
We want the money you
stole from us. Right now.
In you go, slick.
Open it.
- Gentlemen...
- No more of your slippery bullshit.
$50,000. Now.
- I've got it.
- Maggie.
- Told you to shut the hell up.
-
Ah!
The Railroad never keeps cash on hand.
A defense against thieves.
We ain't leaving here without
restitution, of one sort or another.
Just give him some time, Jack.
You will get your money,
you have my word.
Your word's mud to me, Maggie.
I need a couple of days.
You got two.
And then it gets bloody.
Where's the money, New York?
I needed the funds
to cover a lumber deal in Maine.
Maine?
That lumber deal is financing
a steel mill in Chicago,
which is supporting a cotton
operation in Virginia,
which is supporting a
coal mine in Kentucky...
Jesus. You're broke.
I am between transactions.
This house was built long
before you came in, Maggie.
You knew what you were getting
when you waltzed through the door.
What I know is those ranchers are
dangerous when they are cornered.
We need to find a way to pay them
or we will be hip deep in blood.
And ain't no scheme in
the world gonna save us.
Go away.
Ju-Long, let her pass.
Forgive him.
It's not often someone like you
frequents our establishment.
Be more frequent y'all was friendlier.
Hmm.
What can I do for you?
I figure, whoever lost this, they
pay a little to get it back.
I'll see it gets returned.
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Chang.
- Anything else?
- Tell me,
where can I find a dress like that?
Holy shit.
Nothin' holy in there.
Clear that rock.
Inside! Clear the rock!
Damn!
These chunks is twice as big as the
ones we get with black powder.
One
charge didn't explode.
-  Hoi find one charge, no boom.
- Hey, don't touch that!
You hurt?
Are you hurt?
You hurt?
Air bubbles in the cartridge sometimes
blow the charge at the wrong time.
No way to predict, no way to prevent.
COLLIS: How often do the fuses fail?
As often as they damn well please.
We'll sweep first next time.
It won't happen again.
You're not seriously planning
to continue this farce.
We pulled five inches of rock
off that wall with one blast.
- And killed three Chinamen.
- I was there.
I'll check for misfires myself.
You can't work 'round the clock.
No. But we can.
No.
I ain't asking, Jim.
You're ordering me, Bohannon?
I am.
I respectfully refuse.
Mr. Bohannon, tell me, do you plan
to stay with the Central Pacific
until the end of this race?
I'll pound the last spike myself.
Then Mr. Strobridge has just made
himself a very expensive redundancy.
Can't have Mozart and Chopin playing
different tunes on the same piano.
There's plenty of other
work to go around.
If he won't do what we
need him to, well...
Perhaps he'd be happier someplace else.
Ms. Diane Brewer. What's
going on in there?
- Been quiet nearly an hour.
-
Hey!
Just a few more minutes, madam.
This prostitute's locus of amativeness
is unusually overdeveloped.
It's not surprising,
given her occupation.
Well, I hope you enjoyed her
locus, 'cause that'll be $12.
Outrageous.
I didn't even partake in the
whore's intended use...
Well, you're paying for her time.
And Tess can drain eight pricks
an hour, so that makes $12.
The army owes me 14 weeks' back pay.
- When I return to Laramie...
- Something in trade.
Today.
An unbreakable savage. I
recommend against him.
He's perfect.
All yours, madam.
How much do you think I'm
worth to the Railroad?
Were I to go missing?
Let's say,
masked men kidnap me for my private
car, in front of Mr. Delaney.
They demand $250,000 for my return.
And threaten to kill me, if Delaney
reveals this to anybody except the board.
The board hopes to avoid the plummeting
share price that would result
in the breaking news of their
president's kidnapping.
So, they agree to send the
funds within the day.
Our cash problems are solved.
It sounds like you should
be talking to Mr. Delaney.
Sisters would say Patricks
are better liars.
No, he needs to believe it's real.
It's my neck in the noose if
this goes sideways, you know.
Then find men to ensure it doesn't.
There's $25,000 for your trouble.
When I said ownership came
with responsibilities,
I wasn't talking about polishing
the board room's glassware.
That's it.
Dangerous.
Don't...
Dad.
Why do fish fight when they get hooked?
Because their job is to get away.
But doesn't fighting a
hook make it harder?
CULLEN: Mr. Strobridge.
Janie, go around and grab
me some other flies.
Okay.
Mr. Bohannon.
- Little troublemaker.
-
Watch out now.
Huntington's gonna fire you,
you don't fall in line.
Why? Because I won't blow myself up?
Did four clean sweeps today.
Moved near a foot of
granite, no incidents.
Works great until you're dead.
- I understand you're scared.
- Damn right I'm scared.
My little girl needs a father
who can take her fishing.
Plus I got the boys, Hanna.
Can't do 'em any good dead.
Can't put food on their
table, you ain't got a job.
The railroad might be the
most important thing to you,
but it ain't for me.
Ponder on it, Jim.
Marty.
I mean, what's your boss planning to do
about the mob of angry land speculators?
Abby filed for divorce.
Claiming abandonment.
- You didn't abandon her, you' working.
- I abandoned everything.
My firm, my principles...
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Lost souls in a wasteland.
So you're not disputing the charge.
I'm a free man.
I can do whatever I want,
wherever I want, with who...
With whomever I want.
Okay...
Why aren't you married?
Don't tell me no one ever
asked. I know that's not true.
I just haven't found
the right person yet.
You're an alluring woman.
Mmm.
- Thank you, Marty.
- I want to buy you a drink.
- Barkeep!
- Marty, we have... We have a bottle.
Hmm.
You're always nice to me.
You're the only one here who's Ce to me.
I mean, not even Abby was ever really...
And now she's...
Okay.
- I'm sorry. I...
- It's fine.
- I've been drinking.
- I can see that.
Uh, Marty, maybe you should just...
Go home. Be with your wife.
I couldn't do that to Mr. Durant.
You don't owe him anything.
He needs me.
He doesn't even respect you.
I respect me.
- Ah.
- I got $5,000 selling cattle.
Should buy us time with Nobles.
Buy them back. I've found the money.
That's a bigger heap of
shit than my steers left.
You just take it and say thank you.
The funds are being
wired even as we speak.
No schemes. I promise.
Charles, go fetch Mr. Delaney.
I sold some of my personal
stock in Union Pacific.
Quietly, so as to not frighten the
board or depress the share price.
Well, I have never known Thomas
Durant to dip into his own pocket.
Never has Thomas Durant
had good reason to do so.
If the share price dropped, you could buy
yours back for a quick little profit.
No, no... That is a scheme I
could have engaged in. Hmm.
Make nice with Nobles until
your funds come through.
You, come here.
I got a job for you.
The last time I heard that I got
a sunburn and Josie got killed.
Our share's $25,000.
Who we killing?
No one dies.
But you can puck Mr. Durant, all right?
Now, that's a job I can get behind.
Good man.
JAMES: He's it, not me.
Ms. Strobridge.
Take your brood inside for a moment.
Anything you gotta say to
me, you can say to us.
Well, I think it'd be better
if we spoke in private.
Better for you, or better
for us, Mr. Huntington?
Say your piece.
Very well, Mr. Strobridge,
the Central Pacific no longer requires
your services as railroad superintendent.
You have until tomorrow
to pack your things.
The railroad will provide
transit for you and your family
wherever you want to go.
Just hitch our car to the next
train and we'll be gone today.
Mr. Strobridge, as you know,
this car is company property.
We'll need it vacated
upon your departure.
- You're taking our house?
- Hanna.
I suspect you need it
ready for my replacement.
It's your choice, Jim.
I was your only friend.
Never mind about the train tickets.
We can make our own way.
Very well. The Central Pacific
thanks you for your service, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Huntington.
What lies beyond the railroad for you?
Everything that's not
nailed down is mine.
Mmm.
Whatever I can pry loose
isn't nailed down.
A truly American sentiment.
Every market in this country will be
within my reach once my road is complete.
And the markets of the far east?
Do they not hold a similar allure?
I take things one step
at a time, Mr. Chang.
Pity.
Your railroad could be
the bridge to China.
A new Silk Road.
Not to mention an excellent opportunity
for you to expand your business
on the back of my herculean labors.
A mutually beneficial arrangement.
Sze Yup ships are already docked
at your western terminus.
An exclusive shipping contract
is merely a pen stroke away.
So, that's what lies
ahead for you, is it?
Mmm.
A Pacific shipping empire?
A man who desires only one
thing will never be satisfied.
Must be why
I'm always smiling.
Car's still mine for
the rest of the day.
I got a live charge on the wall.
I don't work for you anymore, Bohannon.
Had to ask.
It ain't recommended that
you reattach the fuse.
Your only option is to drill
another hole, and blow 'em both.
Drilling that close to the
charge could set off the nitro.
Could. Probably will.
You could just leave it.
I ain't ending the Central Pacific
in the middle of a tunnel
in the Eastern Sierras.
Then pick two Jakes you
don't mind losing.
Hey, Bohannon.
You know why fish always pull against the
hook, even though it makes things worse?
Because they're fish.
They don't know any better.
Ah.
Careful, Bossman.
You get outta here. It ain't safe.
We together.
Will you please get the hell outta here?
Whatcha all looking at?
Grab that sledge.
Whoo!
How you boys doing?
Whoo!
All right! Let's clear this rock!
We got a mountain to move!
-
-
We don't need anything at the
moment, thank you, Peter.
I'm afraid Peter has wandered off.
What is she doing here?
I mentioned we were going to New York.
I am not giving an interview.
Get out of my private car.
So you have no comment on
the money you're paying out
to Jack Nobles and the other ranchers?
That's right, I have no comment.
"Union Pacific president pays out $50,000
for role in fraudulent land scheme."
There was no fraud.
The board decided to move the
hub without my knowledge.
Then why pay the money?
It's time you went back to your seat.
Look. Get out of my car now.
Not until I get a quote.
-
- MAN: Hands up!
What are you protect...
Hey! What...
Up!
Martin, stop... Stop it.
Stop!
You little shite!
- No!
-
LOUISE: No!
THOMAS: Oh, God.
No.
Stop!
I'm the one you want.
Take me.
Please!
Move!
Leg sore?
Yeah.
Leg sore.
Every step of my life,
I lost everybody I ever had.
All I got left is scars.
Father say when this box empty,
we leave Gold Mountain and go home.
Last leaf inside for two years.
I never take it out.
Ah-Fong, I have
your father's payment.
I want the rest of men trained
on nitro by the end of the week.
- You hear me?
- Mmm.
You.
Any of them have a problem,
find me ones who don't.
My money?
Feels light.
I assure you it's all there.
