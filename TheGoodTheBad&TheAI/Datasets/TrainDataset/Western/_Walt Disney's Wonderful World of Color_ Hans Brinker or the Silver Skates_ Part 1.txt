Hans Brinker
was a Dutch boy
who lived in a small village
by the Zuider Zee.
His story takes place
about 100 years ago.
In those days, Holland had
all the quaint characteristics
we have come to think of
as typically Dutch.
All the charm and the beauty
captured and passed on to us
in the paintings
of the great Dutch masters,
such as Vermeer, Ruisdael,
and Rembrandt.
Here, in the fishing village
of our story,
the men pursued
their livelihood on the sea
for six hardworking days
each week.
But on the seventh,
they took their folks to church.
And that is where they'd been
on the particular Sunday in spring
when our story begins.
Among the good burghers
on their way home from Sunday Mass,
was a humble family
of fisherfolk called Brinker.
What a wonderful day for a sail.
- On Sunday?
- Why not? We've been to church.
- We can go to the coast for a picnic.
- Please, Mother.
All right.
l'll pack a basket lunch.
- May l invite Hilda van Gleck?
-  Of course.
Do you think the burgomaster
will approve?
Why shouldn't he?
Good day, Mevrouw.
Burgomaster.
We wondered if Hilda
would like to come sailing.
- May l, please?
- No, it's out of the question.
Besides, we're taking coffee
with the Schimmels.
- l'm sorry, Hans.
- So am l.
- Come in, Hilda.
- Another time, perhaps.
l would have liked to have
gone sailing with Hans.
lt's right that you're polite
to persons like the Brinkers,
but you must not
associate with them.
Why not? They're decent, honest folk
and it's fun to be with them.
Father means you should choose
companions from your own class.
Oh, Mother. l suppose he means
someone like Ludwig Schimmel.
He bores me.
l much prefer the company
of Hans Brinker.
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
*
Have you ever heard people say
that the Lord created the earth,
- but the Dutch made Holland?
- No.
Well, once upon a time,
all the land where we now live
was covered by water.
Then our
great-great-grandfathers came
and decided to take it from the sea.
- Take it from the sea?
- Yes.
First, they built a big dike, like this,
to keep the ocean back.
Then they used windmills
to pump the water out,
so they could raise crops
and build towns
- where the sea used to be.
- lt's called the watcher.
Because it always keeps
both eyes open, watching the sea.
But sometimes a storm drives
the waves over the watcher,
- so they built a second dike.
- lt's called the dreamer.
lt's only half awake,
until it's needed.
But then it stands there,
holding the water back.
And that one?
That last one
is called the sleeper.
lt just lies there, snoozing
like our old cat in front of the fire.
But if the sea ever broke
through the two other dikes,
the sleeper would wake up
and save us from being drowned.
Now you understand what
people mean when they say,
''The Lord created the earth,
but the Dutch made Holland.''
- Let me see.
- lt's not very good.
Well, l don't know much about it,
but l think you have talent.
l want to learn.
l want to be a good artist.
Then you shall be. They say a man can
do anything if he puts his mind to it.
- Now, what about a race?
- Good. Where?
Over the dike, around the windmill
over there, and then back.
- l'll get back first.
- You mean you'll try.
Get ready. Go!
Beat him, Father!
That wasn't fair.
You pulled me back.
l can't let you beat me yet.
-
-  Father, come quickly!
Yes, you see what can happen
if you don't keep a close watch.
The sea is our friend
because we live by it.
But it could also be our enemy,
and if we are not careful,
we might die by it.
We better be starting for home.
Even on Sunday,
the devil can brew a storm.
lt's time you two went to bed.
Otherwise, you'll be sleepy
for school tomorrow.
Just a little while longer, Mother.
-
-  Gretel...
To the loft, both of you.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.
-  Good night, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Father.
Don't forget your prayers.
Metje, have you seen
all these drawings Hans has made?
- l've seen them.
- Don't you think they're good?
Perhaps, but he should be
learning a useful trade,
not wasting his time
making pictures.
Wasting his time?
He wants to be an artist.
Holland has too many artists,
all poor.
lsn't that better than being
a poor fisherman, like his father?
l'm serious, Raff.
l'm worried about Hans.
Gretel will be all right.
She can cook and sew.
She'll find a husband.
But what will be the future for Hans?
l think a man should work
at what he enjoys.
l want our children to have
a better life than we've had.
But we are getting along fine.
Now, perhaps. But when
winter comes and fishing is poor,
there will be hardly
enough to eat again.
Metje, you don't have
to worry anymore.
l've been keeping
a surprise for you.
-
-  Mother.
- Mother, what is it?
- Oh, darling. Did it frighten you?
Oh, it's such an awful weather.
Come, darling.
See? See how it rains.
lt was so loud.
Look.
Where did you get
all that money?
For years, ever since
Gretel was born,
whenever l made an extra guilder,
l put it aside.
First, l filled my tobacco pouch.
Then a sock.
And now, do you know
how much we have?
No.
- Exactly one thousand guilder.
- Oh, Raff.
Now you don't have to
work so hard in your old age.
l like to work. Who would want
to sit and just do nothing?
This is for you and the children.
lf Hans wants to be an artist,
all l ask is that he's a good one.
- Where are you going?
- To hide this where it's safe.
Now you're going to bed, darling.
Like...
that.
- Now, you go to sleep.
-
Raff! Open up!
Kaps, come in.
You, too, Peter.
What brings you out
on a night like this?
The dike at Sloterdam has broken.
- They need men to repair it.
- Let's get started then.
- May l go, too, Father?
- Why not? Get dressed.
They say it's the worst storm
in 40 years.
The waves are breaking
over the seawall.
Hurry up, Hans.
Put your backs into it, men!
Keep them coming!
More bags.
Ah!
-  Father!
-
Help!
After him!
He's hurt bad.
Fortunately, the skull wasn't broken.
l think he will be all right in time.
When they brought him home,
he didn't even recognize us.
That should pass soon.
Of course, he has to be
in bed for a while.
l'll look in again this evening.
Peter and l will be glad
to share our catch with you
till Raff is on his feet again.
Thank you, Kaps.
You are a good friend.
But we'll get along.
Raff managed to put something aside.
That's good. We fishermen
live from hand to mouth.
Come on, Peter.
You mustn't worry. l'll take
the Sea Beggar out tomorrow.
We must ask the good Lord
to make your father well again soon.
But as the weeks
went by, Raff didn't improve.
He could sit by the window now,
but he was listless and vacant.
His memory was gone,
and with it any recollection of his
savings and their secret hiding place.
lf we could only find
the money your father hid,
we'd have more than enough
to live on.
Why don't you ask him again?
Perhaps he'll remember this time.
Raff, it's me, your wife.
Darling, do you remember
the money you saved?
- Money?
- Yes. A thousand guilders.
You hid them in a leather bag
the night of the big storm.
Storm?
You took it into the storeroom,
but we can't find it.
We searched everywhere.
You must have hidden it well.
Where is it?
Love, do you understand?
Where is the money
in the leather bag?
You must remember.
We need the money desperately!
Don't cry, Mother.
Please don't cry.
l'm sorry.
You eat your soup.
You must be hungry.
Summer and fall went by,
and somehow
the Brinkers survived.
But then...
to make matters worse,
winter, bitter and severe,
came very early that year.
Hans quit school,
for though he was
too young for a steady job,
the responsibility for his family's
support now rested on him.
No job was too lowly
nor too hard.
There were five mouths to feed,
and the medicines for his
sick father were costly.
Hans, wait!
l haven't seen you for a long time.
Where are you going?
l'm taking wood to the tavern.
How's your father?
Much better, thank you.
He's able to sit up now.
That's good.
l missed seeing you.
When are you and Gretel
coming back to school?
Not for a while. We have to
help out till Father's on his feet.
l hope you're keeping up
with your drawing.
l've been too busy fishing all summer
and now doing odd jobs.
You mustn't give up your drawing.
There are so many artists
much better than l'll ever be.
You're too modest.
My father's bought a lot of pictures,
and l don't like them
as well as yours.
Promise me that no matter
how difficult it is,
you won't give it up.
l'll keep on with it then.
Hilda, l thought you
were coming with us.
Just a minute, Ludwig.
lt was good to see you again.
Yes.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Too bad about
Hans's father, isn't it?
- But he is getting better.
- Better?
He's a helpless idiot.
Ludwig, what a terrible thing to say.
lt's true. l've seen him
sitting in his window, just staring.
They say he doesn't even know
his own wife and children.
Dr. Krupp will cure him.
How can anyone cure a man
who's lost his mind?
We can hope, can't we?
- Good-bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hilda.
Bye.
l can carry my own
books home, thank you.
* Sing to the sturdy men
Who pull the heavy barges

And the mate and all the crew

We stop to wet our whistles

- Find any work?
- Nothing but this.
Try the woodcutting mill?
They don't need anyone.
Neither does Schimmel.
Times are bad.
l'm lucky to wash pots here.
Maybe Captain Jansen will take you on.
He's on his way back to Hoorn.
l'll ask him.
- * Drink, brothers, drink
- * Drink to the sturdy men
* Drink, brother, drink, brother
Drink, brother, drink, brother
* Drink *
Excuse me, Captain.
l'm Raff Brinker's son.
Oh, is he getting any better?
Dr. Krupp says it'll take time.
He ought to see a brain doctor.
- A brain doctor?
- Dr. Boekman.
Saved my brother when
the others gave him up.
- But he'll be expensive.
- He's the best in all the Netherlands.
- Can you give me work?
- Pulling my barge?
- That's man's work.
- But l'm strong.
Next year maybe. See Dr. Boekman.
lf anybody can cure your father, he can.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- From the beginning. All together.
* Drink to the sturdy men
Who pull the heavy barges
* Drink to the captain
And the mate and all the crew...
Good evening, Father.
-  You are late.
- l've been looking for work.
Didn't you find anything?
l made a little delivering wood,
but it won't pay for Father's medicine.
We saved some soup for you.
You mustn't feel badly, son.
We'll manage somehow.
We can't keep taking charity.
l know. lf we could only find
the money your father hid,
we would have more
than enough to live on.
- l'm going to Amsterdam in the morning.
- Why would you go there?
l've heard about a famous brain doctor.
A Dr. Boekman.
We can't even pay old Dr. Krupp.
How can we afford
a famous city doctor?
l'm hoping someone
might buy my drawings.
l'll take our lace and sell it.
We should get a better price
in the big city.
So early next morning,
Hans and Gretel went to Amsterdam.
The Dutch metropolis
is not only Holland's capital,
it's also one of the world's
most exciting places,
proudly called
''the Venice of the north, ''
for it, too, is a city
of islands, bridges and canals.
It, too, is a seat
of learning and the arts,
of soaring buildings
and mighty churches,
dynamic with the bustle of business
and world commerce.
Under any other circumstances,
this first glimpse of the big city
would have been sheer magic
for Hans and Gretel.
But even so, it held out hope.
Hope to turn their handiwork
into cash.
Hope to find the celebrated doctor.
Excuse me. Can you tell us
how to find the marketplace?
Just cross that bridge there.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
There's a place over there.
Oh, look, Henry!
What exquisite lace!
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a drawing, sir.
This is hardly the place
to show pictures.
Where should l go?
- To the street of the art dealers.
- Thank you.
lf l have any luck,
l'll call on Dr. Boekman.
l'll be waiting for you.
Look, l want this, and perhaps this.
Oh, don't be so bored, Henry.
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the street of the art dealers?
- Over there.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
Well, what do you think of it?
lt's wonderful, sir.
l've never seen anyone use oils before.
ls it difficult?
Yes, at first.
Can you tell me where to find
the art dealers?
- Are you an artist, too?
- l hope to be.
Now l only draw with a pencil.
May l see one?
Hmm. They're not bad.
There's a strong feeling
for the land here.
- ls this your village?
- Yes, sir.
l suppose you have come
to Amsterdam to sell them.
lf anyone would want
such plain sketches.
The old masters often
worked in black and white.
Even the greatest, who once
lived in that house l'm painting.
- Who's that, sir?
- Who was...
Why, Rembrandt van Rijn, of course.
Did Rembrandt really live there?
For 20 years.
That was his happy period,
when he was married to Saskia.
Didn't he die in poverty?
Yes. But l think
he was happy even then,
for he had fulfilled
his ambitions.
- Do you understand that?
- l think l do, sir.
Come. l'll introduce you
to a friend of mine
who has helped a lot of artists
to get started, including me.
Will you take this?
No. No.
Think you might take a few
on consignment, Mynheer Dionne?
Well, maybe one.
lf he sells it, you can
give him a commission.
Thank you, sir.
Do you know where
l can find a Dr. Boekman?
He's living in the big house
on Princengracht.
Why do you want to see him?
My father was in an accident
last spring and lost his memory.
Hmm. So, maybe l can take two more.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
l'm very grateful to you, sir,
but l don't even know your name.
Frans Ruisdael.
Here's a little present so you can
begin to experiment with colors.
Colors! lt's a wonderful gift.
- But you are too generous.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you again, sir.
l'll come back as soon as my paintings
are worthy enough.
- What's his name?
- Hans. Hans Brinker.
Who knows. He might
turn out to be good someday.
- Oh, yes. l want to pay for this.
- Put your money away.
You think you are the only one
who wants to encourage young talents?
- What is it?
- l'd like to see Dr. Boekman.
The doctor sailed for London.
London?
When will he be back?
- He'll be away at least two weeks.
- l'll come back then.
- What happened?
- The doctor won't be back for weeks.
Too bad. l sold everything.
The rich lady bought the lace.
The rest went for a good price.
- Look.
- You did well.
- You'd better carry the money home.
- All right.
- l saw where Rembrandt lived.
- You did?
And l met a real artist.
Frans Ruisdael.
He liked my drawings enough
to introduce me to an art dealer
- who will try to sell some for me.
- That's wonderful.
And the artist gave me these paints.
Good ones, too. Now l can try colors.
People are kind here.
The rich lady asked about me,
and when l told her
how hard it had been for Mother,
she said she'd call on us.
That's nice of her, but why?
l don't know, but l think
she means to help us.
We must celebrate tonight.
Let's ask Kaps and Peter
to have dinner with us for a change.
Ahhh!
What a good meal, Metje!
Like old times, eh, Raff?
Want to play your accordion? Hmm?
Oh, you want me to play it, huh?
* There's an old sailor song
That we sing all day long
* And we call it
''The wooden shoe waltz''
* When we're far out at sea
This gay melody
* Makes us dream
Of our sweethearts
* By the old Zuider Zee
* Oh, my darling, my darling,
My Hollander miss
* I'm longing to hug you
And give you a kiss
* Then whirl you around while
The band plays with schmaltz
* As we dance to the tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz''
- * Like this
-
- * Like this
-
* Then whirl you around
And give you a big kiss
- * Like this
-
- * Like this
-
* The tune of
''The wooden shoe waltz'' *
But Raff's smile
was only fleeting.
The harsh gray winter months
marched by.
In those days, when the ice
locked up canals and waterways,
the pulse in those
busy arteries of Holland
came almost to a standstill.
No wonder it became ever more
difficult for Hans to find work,
though he tried everything
in his power to help out.
But the urge to be an artist
was equally strong in him.
He devoted each leisure hour
to canvas and brush.
Hadn't it been the lot
of many a Dutch artist
to suffer privations
before attaining fame?
And anyway,
he'd promised Hilda
that he would not
neglect his talent.
l suppose you want to see
what Hans is painting.
l'll join you later.
Come on.
The ice is better over there.
Hello, Hans.
- Hello, Hilda.
- May l see?
Oh, it's wonderful!
lt's so exciting to work in colors.
Things used to seem dull and gray,
but now l see everything differently.
- Do you, Hans?
- lt's all because of you.
Now l feel confident.
l believe in myself.
l'm glad.
l am anxious
to try a portrait next.
How would you like to paint me?
l'd like to very much.
When?
ls tomorrow all right,
after school?
Fine. l'd ask you
to come to our house,
but Father isn't feeling
too well these days.
l know where we can go.
lnside the mill.
- lt's warm, and boss won't mind.
- l'll be waiting.
l'd like to surprise Father
with it on St. Nicholas Day.
Maybe he'll want to buy it.
Oh, l wouldn't feel right
about selling it to you.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
- Very good coffee. Thank you.
-
Come in, young man.
As l was saying, my husband
and l have no children.
We are quite well-to-do.
We live in a house with
more rooms than we can use.
Mynheer Korbes has consented
to let me investigate conditions here.
l admit, l expected to find
a sordid atmosphere.
Even drunkenness, perhaps.
But l must say,
l'm relieved.
Everything is quite clean
and tidy, despite your poverty.
Gretel, you would like
to live in a big nice house
with servants and good food,
wouldn't you?
l hardly need to remind you
of the advantages
that Gretel would have
that's she's missing now.
But, Mevrouw Korbes,
l couldn't leave my family.
Do you mean...
You mean that you would
prefer to live here?
We're very happy together.
Of course, you could visit Gretel
whenever you wish.
My husband is prepared
to send you a sum from time to time,
until your husband is able to work.
Thank you for your good intentions,
Mevrouw Korbes,
but l could never give up
one of my children.
But...
l hope you understand.
We are all so close...
Perhaps if you raised children
of your own, you'd know what l mean.
A family is something
you never separate,
no matter how poor you are.
Well, it's your decision.
l only wanted to help you.
l think you'll come to realize
you're not being fair to Gretel.
Here's my husband's card
if you change your mind.
- Gretel.
- Good evening.
And l thought
she came to help us.
Oh, she meant well, Hans.
You can't blame one who can't understand
what a family means to each other.
- Hello, boss.
- Hello.
Hello, boss.
Hans is going to do my portrait
as a surprise for Father.
Ah, it should be interesting.
lt may not turn out
like Rembrandt,
but the light and shadows
are the same.
Well, well.
What's the matter, Ludwig?
You haven't carried
Hilda's books home lately.
- No, sir.
- Have you had a falling out?
l don't think l should tell you, sir.
Tell me what? lf it concerns
my daughter, speak up.
Well, l don't believe
in carrying tales, sir.
Tales? Tales?
What do you mean?
Well...
Hilda's been meeting secretly
with Hans Brinker.
What?
l just saw them
go into Boss' windmill alone.
Boss' windmill alone?
Ja, it's coming pretty good.
lt even looks like her.
l'll get some more firewood.
Mind if l rest a moment?
No, of course not.
Oh, it's going to be good.
Father will be very pleased.
So, this is how you abuse
my confidence, Hilda?
- l'm ashamed of you.
- But, Father!
Go home at once.
You'll be punished later.
Hans Brinker, l forbid you
to ever see my daughter again.
But you don't understand, sir.
Silence!
You're an insolent peasant.
lf l ever hear you're meeting
secretly with Hilda again,
l'll have you horsewhipped!
Oh, what's the good burgomaster
so upset about?
Didn't he like your painting?
Hans, have you seen your father?
- No.
- He's wandered off somewhere.
l'm afraid something terrible happened.
- l'll find him. Take this and go home.
- All right.
lt's the idiot!
Where is he?
Down by the canal.
You stay here.
l'll get the watchman.
Father!
lt's me, Father.
Come back home, won't you, please?
There he is.
Arrest him.
lt's Raff!
Come on and help!
lt's me, Raff.
Your old friend.
Come on. Let's go home.
They shouldn't
let him run around like this.
He should be put away.
-  Oh, it's terrible.
- Poor Metje.
Well, he's quiet now.
You should all take some rest.
How can we rest?
l'm afraid, Kaps. Poor Raff
doesn't know what he's done.
You know what
they're saying in the tavern?
That they're going to send
your father to an asylum.
l'm sorry.
l wish we could help.
You've done everything you could.
Thank you.
We better be going, Peter.
You mustn't worry.
Dr. Boekman is due back soon.
l am going to see him.
How are we going to pay
such an expensive doctor?
- l hope the dealer sold my drawings.
- You mustn't count on that.
lf worst comes to worst,
l can let the rich lady adopt me.
- Oh, no.
- No, Gretel, you won't have to do that.
l'll find something.
Hans and Gretel
redoubled their efforts,
but the promise of a solution
for their troubles
came from an entirely
unexpected source.
Hans! Gretel!
Have you heard about the competition
on St. Nicholas Day?
That's the one with the prize
of the silver skates.
There's 300 guilders, too,
for the boy and girl who wins it.
This is the miracle
we've been waiting for.
Even if we get in the finals,
we'll be up against the best skaters
on the whole Zuider Zee.
Who cares?
We all have the same chance.
lf one of us wins,
our problems will be solved.
We better go sign up now.
Come on.
l'll race you to the town hall.
Go!
And so the possibility of
winning the prize in the great race
kindled new hope
in Hans and Gretel.
Here, indeed, was a possible solution
to their many problems.
This coming event added, also,
more excitement to one of the
most delightful Dutch holidays,
St. Nicholas Day, the time when St. Nick
appears on his handsome white steed.
It is a time for parties
and the giving of gifts,
much like our Christmas.
At the mayor's house,
as in most homes along the Zuider Zee,
there was only one topic
of conversation that evening:
tomorrow's qualifying races
to pick the contestants
for the big silver skate event
just two weeks away.
Hilda and l are going to win first
places in the competition tomorrow.
Don't be so sure.
Our town is famous for good skaters.
- Like Hans Brinker?
- Yes, like Hans and his sister.
- Cakes?
-  They shouldn't be allowed.
- Why not?
- They only have wooden skates.
- l don't see why it makes a difference.
- Wooden skates are dangerous.
They can cause an accident.
Hans and Gretel
seem to do all right on theirs.
lt's almost time for St. Nicholas
to be arriving on his white steed.
So let's sing a welcome song
for him. All together.
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof
* We don't need more further proof
* Good St. Nick is coming
* He will fill each little wooden shoe
* If you're good you'll be
Getting something too
* Good St. Nick is coming
* Welcome, St. Nicholas
* Bring us cheer
* For we only see you but once a year
* Hear the hoof beats on the roof
* We don't need more further proof
* Good St. Nick is coming
* He will fill...
-
- Come, children.
Well, hello, little boys and girls.
l hope you've all been
good children during the year.
- Oh, yes.
- We've been good.
So have l.
l'm glad to hear it,
for tonight, when you're asleep,
l'll bring presents down the chimney
into the shoes
of all the good boys and girls.
But l will bring switches
to those who have been bad.
You see, l know everything
that's gone on,
like not studying your lessons,
or squirming in church,
or not obeying your parents.
Some of you could even be guilty
of throwing snowballs
at gentlemen in high hats.
But next year, l'm sure
you will all be little angels again.
Now l must be off to visit other
children all over the country.
So help yourself to the sweets,
and l wish you all a happy
and merry St. Nicholas Day.
Hurry up, children.
You mustn't catch cold.
What are you doing?
What are you doing sneaking
around in the dark like a thief?
l was just passing, Your Honor.
l mean, Your Holiness.
l have this present for the burgomaster.
Present?
l am the one who gives presents, my boy.
When did you do this?
The last few nights.
l painted it from memory.
Well, l'm sure the burgomaster
will like it.
But now you better be off home.
Yes, Your Holiness...
Uh, Your Grace.
l thought everyone had a good time.
- Oh, yes, especially Father.
- How he loves to play St. Nicholas.
Hilda, have you been seeing
the Brinker boy lately?
No, not since you forbade me to.
Hmm. Why don't you
let those go and get some sleep.
- You want to be fresh for the contest.
- All right.
Good night. Thanks for the party.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, dear.
l saw that Brinker boy outside
looking in on the party.
- What did you do?
- Sent him away, of course.
We really should've
invited the Brinkers this year.
lt's been a trying time for them.
Hilda says Hans and Gretel
are entered in the competition.
But they only have
their wooden skates.
Why don't you send
Hilda's old ones to the girl?
That's what l hoped you'd say.
Wasn't it nice of Kaps
and Peter to remember Tiel?
They've had a hard winter, too.
- l carved these for him.
- He'll love them.
lt isn't much.
We have a lot to be grateful for.
Raff used to look forward to
St. Nicholas Day as much as you did.
l remember how excited you used
to be to wake up in the morning
and find your shoes overflowing.
Sometimes he'd go
without tobacco for a month
so he could bring you apples
and gingerbread men.
- Who brought it?
- l don't know.
Perhaps there's a card inside.
- Oh.
- Look.
What it this?
Oh, it must be for you, Gretel.
Now l have a chance to win tomorrow.
- lsn't it wonder...
- l can skate fine on wooden ones.
Let's show your father.
Look, Raff. We have good friends
who remembered us.
All this wonderful food
you need to make you strong.
Tomorrow Hans and Gretel are going to
enter the competition, and they may win.
Look. Gretel has real skates.
The competition has narrowed
down to six boys and six girls.
We shall now select
the finalists for the big race.
The girls will take
their starting positions.
Good luck.
You'll race out to the barrel,
circle it, and return.
The first three to finish
will have the honor
of representing our village
in the big race, the 20th.
On your marks.
Get ready. Go!
Come on, Gretel.
Come on.
Wonderful, Gretel.
You did it.
Congratulations, Hilda.
lt was a good race.
The winners are:
Hilda van Gleck, Gretel Brinker,
and Katrinka Flack.
And now, the boys will take
their starting positions.
Good luck, Hans.
At least get in the finals like l did.
You'll race across the bay, up the canal
as far as the marker, then return.
Don't get behind Brinker.
lf he hits rough ice with those
snowplows, he'll break his neck.
On your marks.
Get ready.
Hey! Come back
and wait for my signal!
On your marks.
Get ready.
Go!
Hans is keeping up.
But it's a long way to go.
Come on, Hans.
Beat him, Hans!
Never mind, Hans!
You can catch up!
That's my boy in the lead.
Beat him!
Beat him!
Ludwig, what happened?
You were first. You were in the lead.
Why did you let him beat you?
And the winners are:
Hans Brink...
Hans Brinker, Ludwig Schimmel,
and Peter Bouman.
lf my son had tried, he could
easily have come in first.
But he didn't. Hans Brinker
beat him, and on wooden skates.
ln the big race,
Brinker won't have a chance.
Who do you think'll win,
Mynheer Schimmel?
My Ludwig, of course.
l've been giving him some pointers.
l'd put my money on Peter,
not because he is my son,
but it takes endurance
to skate 26 miles.
And Peter is a strong lad,
big for his age.
l'll wager 20 guilders
that Ludwig comes in ahead.
l'll take that bet.
Make a note of that.
Forgive me, but l hope that spoiled brat
of his falls and breaks...
Ah, ah, ah, Kaps.
At least we all agree that someone
from our village will win.
l think you're all crowing
a little too soon.
Have you heard of a boy at Hoorn
they call ''Charles the Champion''?
He won the last two years.
That's right.
And he won't be 1 9 until next month.
So, he's entered again.
On the day
the famous surgeon was due back,
Hans went to Amsterdam.
With skates like those,
how much better would be his chances
to win the race and pay
for the doctor's services.
Perhaps the art dealer
had sold one of his drawings.
You won't find anyone in there.
The shopkeeper is ill.
He went home.
- lt's you.
- Has the doctor returned?
This morning, but l'd advise
to come back tomorrow.
But l must see him today.
l'm sorry. He has given
strict orders to admit no one.
He is not feeling well.
He had a rough crossing.
l can't leave without talking to him.
Please.
My father needs help badly.
Very well, but l warn you,
he'll be furious with both of us.
Excuse me, Dr. Boekman.
Didn't l tell you
l was not to be disturbed?
Whatever you're selling,
l don't want it.
- l'm not selling anything, sir.
- What's that you carry?
- Paintings to show an art dealer.
- l'm much too busy to see anyone.
But this can't wait, sir.
lt's about my father.
He had a head injury last spring
and lost his memory.
l'm sorry. l can't take on
any new patients at this time.
Couldn't you just
come and look at him?
Frankly, no. My work has piled up
since l've been away.
Captain Jansen said if anyone
could cure him, you could.
- Who's Captain Jansen?
- Commander of a barge over at Hoorn.
You cured his brother
when everyone gave up.
Oh, yes. lnteresting case.
Amnesia.
Won't you see
if there's any hope?
- You're very persistent.
- l have to be.
People in our village
think he's dangerous.
They want him locked up
in an institution.
- Order my sleigh at once.
- Yes, doctor.
Well, come on.
You've got to show me where you live.
Well, l think the children
should be consulted.
What is it, Mother?
The doctor says an operation
may restore his memory,
but it's very dangerous.
You mean Father might die?
Any operation where pressure on the
brain is concerned is highly delicate.
Fortunately, the patient
appears to be strong physically.
l think he has a good chance
of getting through it.
But we know that no matter
how dangerous, it's necessary.
Don't we?
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes.
When will you do it, doctor?
l have a very full schedule
since l've been away.
Let me see.
Two amputations and, uh...
Well, there's no opening
until the 20th.
Bring him to the Amsterdam
hospital the day before.
Yes, l will.
l'm prescribing some medicine
to quiet his nerves
if he should be restless again.
See he has plenty
of good nourishing food.
Meat, preferably red wine.
- Thank you for coming, Doctor.
- Oh, not at all.
Well, this will be all for today.
- Doctor...
- Huh?
l know you're expensive,
so it's only fair to tell you,
we can't pay for a while.
lt's not my custom to send a bill
until after l have rendered my services.
Good day.
As the day
of the great race drew near,
the contestants in the participating
villages by the Zuider Zee
spent every spare moment
practicing for the event.
- Have you seen Hans anywhere?
- He's embarrassed on his wooden skates,
so he's practicing at the point
where no one can see him.
Thanks.
Did you hurt yourself?
lt's these old wooden skates,
but l'm getting better.
lt's just a question
of jumping over the rough spots.
Still meeting secretly, huh?
What do you mean?
A pretty little scene.
Not as comfortable as the mill, is it?
How did you know about that?
Everyone knows that Hilda's father
forbade her to see you again.
But he didn't know
about the mill.
You're the one
who told the burgomaster.
What if l did?
You are contemptible.
Get your skates off.
My Ludwig was attacked today
by the son of that madman Brinker.
Without provocation, mind you.
As a member of the town council,
l strongly feel
that a boy like Hans Brinker
should not be allowed
to represent our town in the race.
- You sure it was without provocation?
- l have Ludwig's word for it.
l heard from my daughter,
who happened to be present,
and she feels that young Brinker
was entirely justified.
And, frankly, so do l.
Good evening.
On the eve of Raff's
removal to the hospital,
the Brinkers faced two of the most
critical situations of their lives:
Raff's operation
and the race for the big prize.
No wonder the immediate future
held for the little family
a mixture of fear and of hope.
You are going to shave before
we take you to the hospital.
l can't let you
frighten the nurses.
Dr. Boekman is going to
make you well again. l know.
Who's going to take care of Tiel
when we go?
Old Maria's going to take care of him.
Amsterdam hospital,
at your service.
Thank you very much
for the ride.
Will you pick up Hans and be
at the marketplace this afternoon?
But not later than 4:00.
l hope everything goes well.
l think it's best you say
good-bye to your father now.
Good-bye, Father.
Mother, we hate to leave you.
lf it wasn't for the money
we may win, we'd give it up.
Of course you won't.
There's nothing you can do now.
What time are the races tomorrow?
Girls start at 1 0:00
and the boys go right after us.
Hans, when do you think you
will be reaching Amsterdam?
Early afternoon.
We turn back when at King's Bridge.
lf the operation is over
and if your father is out of danger,
l'll wave to you from the bridge.
God be with you.
God be with you.
Come on, darling.
l'll come to the marketplace
as soon as l can.
All right.
Can you help a poor cripple?
Can you help
a poor cripple?
No, l am sorry.
Beggars are not allowed in here.
l am not a beggar, sir.
l am an artist.
-
- Aren't they the same?
You made a good purchase.
Ruisdael is becoming quite popular.
- Yes, so l understand. Good day.
- Good day, sir.
- ls Mynheer Dionne around?
- Oh, he died two weeks ago.
Went home ill and never recovered.
- l'm sorry.
- Everything's in quite a mess.
l'm his nephew.
l'm here to take over.
Do you know if he sold my drawings?
l left some pencil sketches.
Oh, those. Yes.
l'm glad to get rid of them.
They take up space.
- Are these yours?
- Yes.
Now l have better ones.
ln oils. See?
- Perhaps you'd be interested in these?
- l'm selling out. Not buying.
Thank you, sir.
- Are you badly hurt?
- A thief! He stole all my money!
Open the door!
Open up!
Help!
Help! Police! l'm in here!
Help me get out!
What did the boy
who ran after him look like?
Like any beggar.
l wouldn't be surprised if he
wasn't in league with that cutthroat.
They often work in pairs.
- Did the boy leave these paintings?
- And those dreadful drawings, too.
He's no thief. l know him.
He's a friend of mine.
Try and find him.
He might be in trouble.
Yes. Come on.
l am sorry,
but l can't wait any longer.
l can't understand
what's happened to Hans.
He knows we have to be back
for the races tomorrow.
lf he doesn't come soon,
l think you'd better go to the police.
Exhausted by
his vain efforts to get free,
his troubled mind filled with
concern for tomorrow's events,
Hans spent a night
of frustration and anxiety.
Help me! Help me!
Who called for help?
Where are you?
Here! l'm locked in,
and can't get out!
Oh, ho! You must be the boy
the police are looking for.
Wait till l call them,
and we'll have you out in a jiffy.
We've been looking
all night for you.
Can you show us the ship
where you saw this cripple?
- First l must find my sister.
- Don't worry about her.
She's sleeping in a warm police station.
Well, come on then.
lt's nearby.
What do you want?
May l speak to the man
with the crutch, please?
Someone wants to see you.
How did you...
l can't thank you enough, Brinker.
l'll even take your paintings.
On consignment, of course.
Doesn't he get a reward
for recovering the money?
- Certainly. Here you are.
-
Five guilders.
Gretel, it's almost enough
to buy some new skates l saw.
- How much more do you need?
- Two more guilders.
Two more guilders.
We have to pick up my skates.
- We'll never get to the dike by 1 0:00.
- Unless we find a sleigh.
l'm sure Mynheer Dionne will be
happy to loan us his. Come on.
- l don't think they're coming.
- Why wouldn't they?
Maybe they realized
Hans doesn't have a chance.
They had to take their father
to Amsterdam, but they'll be here.
As soon as the dance is over,
l shall call the girls' race.
But, Your Lordship,
two of our contestants are missing.
- Nevertheless, we shall proceed.
- But...
- Where are Hans and Gretel?
- We'll be called any minute.
Silence!
The girls get ready for the first race.
l wish l knew
what's happened to them.
Look over there!
Here comes someone now!
Here they come!
The girls will take
their starting positions.
That's you, Gretel. Hurry!
Good luck!
- Oh!
- What happened to you?
- l've been to Amsterdam...
- There isn't time. Get ready.
Look, they're even better than yours.
When the horn blows,
you will start.
The girls' race is four miles
out to the Zuider Zee and back.
The winner will receive
these silver skates
and 300 guilders.
Good luck to all of you!
Come on! You can do it!
Please don't feel bad about it.
silence!
The winner is Wilhelmina Vooster
of Sparkenburg.
-
-  Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Will you please come forward
and receive your prize?
The prize.
Never mind.
You nearly won.
Anyway, you still
have a chance.
And now the boys
will take their starting positions.
Go on, Hans.
l'm sure you can win.
Good luck, Hans.
You are about to begin
a long-distance race of 26 miles,
across the Zuider Zee
to Amsterdam and return.
The one we have to worry about
is that fellow from Hoorn.
- Which is he?
- The tall one with the fur cap.
They don't call him
Charles the Champion for nothing.
l expect every one of you to finish,
whether he wins or not.
You will start on the horn.
After that,
it's every one for himself.
May the best Hollander win.
Oh. lt has been called
to my attention that there is
a dangerous patch of thin ice
in the south basin.
So heed the warning and be certain
that you all go around it.
Good luck!
Even with the best possible speeds,
they won't be back for a long time.
Come. l invite you
to the tavern for a drink.
- Hurry! Come on!
- Hurry!
Hans! Here l am!
Your father is out of danger!
That's it, Henry!
Go, boy, go! Go!
l don't see Hans anywhere.
- But Peter is second.
- Come on, Peter!
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!
- Where's my boy?
- What happened to Hans Brinker?
They were both behind me
when we left the canal.
The winner is
Peter Bouman of Volendam.
Will you please come forward
and receive your prize?
My 20 guilders, if you please.
l don't understand it.
There must be foul play here somewhere.
Here they come!
-  Get a blanket.
-  They're hurt?
Something must have happened.
Hans! Ludwig!
What happened?
Peter! You won?
Yeah. But what happened to you?
- Well, tell us now.
- Out with it.
lt was all my fault.
l tried to take a shortcut
across the thin ice,
and it wouldn't hold me.
Hans pulled me out.
And what do you have
to say to that?
l say...
l say we should both be glad
that our town won.
Come on, Ludwig.
l am sorry.
Thanks for everything
you've done.
You're recovering quickly,
l don't l have to call on you again.
- lt's that thick Dutch head of mine.
-
- We can't thank you enough, Doctor.
- No.
Peter Bouman has offered
to lend us his prize money.
- So we can pay your fee.
- l warn you. lt's pretty high.
This is my fee.
And l won't take anything less.
A genuine Hans Brinker is going to be
worth a lot of money one of these days.
By the way, someone has
taken care of your hospital bill.
- Who was that?
- Mynheer Schimmel
said it had something to do
with Hans and his son.
- Well, good day.
-
What's all of this
about money?
Why didn't you use
the thousand guilders l saved?
Oh, Raff.
We ransacked the storeroom.
We looked everywhere.
Somebody must have
stolen it.
But you didn't look under
the loose board, did you? Huh?
Oh, Raff.
Do you call that a safe place
to hide so much money?
- Anyone could have found it.
- But you didn't, did you?
No, because it was too easy.
Oh, you silly man!
* There's an old sailor song
That we sing all day long
* And we call it
''The wooden shoe waltz''
* When we're far out at sea
This gay melody
* Makes us dream of our sweethearts
* By the old Zuider Zee
* Oh, my darling, my darling,
My Hollander miss
* I'm longing to hug you
And give you a kiss
* Then whirl you around while
The band plays with schmaltz
* And dance to the strains of
''The wooden shoe waltz''
- * Like this
-
- * Like this
-
* Then whirl you around
And give you a big kiss
- * Like this
-
- * Like this
-
* The dance of
''The wooden shoe waltz'' *
