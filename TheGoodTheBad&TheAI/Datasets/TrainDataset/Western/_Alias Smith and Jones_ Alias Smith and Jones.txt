NARRATOR:
Into the West came many men.
Some were good men
and some were bad men.
Some were good men
with some bad in them.
And some were bad men
with some good in them.
This is the story
of two pretty good bad men.
Together, these gentlemen
substantially altered
the course
of America's frontier.
They did a lot to change
railroad schedules, too.
And in all the trains
and banks they robbed,
This made our two Iatter-day
Robin Hoods very popular
with everyone but the
railroads and banks.
Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry robbed from the
rich and kept the money for themselves.
It was a good life,
but times were changing.
Safes were getting better, the
posses were getting bigger,
and modern communications
made it only a matter of time
until they would be captured
and maybe even killed.
Stand and deliver!
Who says so?
Kid Curry.
Hannibal Heyes.
AII right. Everybody out!
Move it, pronto!
Let's go, move it!
How're you boys coming
with that safe?
She's gonna blow
sky-high!
Take the dirt, folks!
Look out!
Pull her down, boys.
I'm Birdie Pickett.
I'm so...
How much dynamite
did you use, Kyle?
Every last stick of it.
For one little old safe?
This ain't no
little old safe.
This is a Brooker 202.
What's the delay?
Well, I'm sure
I don't know, ma'am.
Better go check
your fuse, Kyle.
I ain't going in there!
Listen, when the leader ofthe
gang tells him to do something,
don't he have to do it?
Yeah, that's my understanding.
But what makes you
such a great leader, Heyes,
is that you never tell
no man to do a thing
you wouldn't do yourself.
You wanna be leader?
After you.
Kyle got it wet.
Well, whose fault is that?
I warned you not to ford
that river, didn't I? Huh?
Oh, no.
No, you and your short cuts.
Don't get
proddy, Wheat.
Hey! Folks are getting restless.
They're starting to mutter.
Mutter what?
Oh, like, maybe you two
don't know what you're doing.
Like if you can't even
blow up the safe,
maybe you ought to get in
some other line of work.
That kind of talk
could ruin us.
Well, I happen to agree with him.
Wheat...
Wasn't no offense meant, Kid.
None taken, Wheat.
Now, I wanna remind you boys that
we don't exactly have a Iot oftime,
so if you would just Iet Heyes here
have a few quiet minutes to work...
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on, Kyle.
I suppose
you boys are wondering
what a little old lady from Boston is
doing way out here in the Wild West.
Ma'am, I wonder if you could
kind of keep your voice down.
My partner
has to hear the tumbler.
Tumblers? Oh, I know. But if
you don't mind an opinion,
I don't think that you
and your friend are cut out
for this sort ofthing.
Well, now,
wait a minute, ma'am.
Now, this ain't been
our best day.
MRS. PICKETT: I'm sure.
But I do thinkthat
you ought to read this.
What's this?
Some kind of religious tract?
Well, it may be the answer to
all of your problems, my dear.
Now, you just take it and read
it when you find the time.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
And now you had
better get back to work
because I see
your friends are frowning.
Uh...
It's no use.
This safe ain't human. lt'Il take
me two hours to get into it.
AII right, then,
let's make tracks.
This train's due
into Columbine right now.
Posse will be leaving out of
Columbine 10 minutes from now.
Lot oftruth in there.
Yeah, but there's $50,000
in this safe.
We ain't leaving it behind.
What are you suggesting
we do with it?
HEYES:
We're taking it with us!
When I said,
"Let's make tracks,"
that ain't exactly
what I had in mind.
That posse's gonna be real
grateful to Heyes, ain't they?
How'd you do it, Wheat?
Smarter.
But how?
That's for me to know
and you to find out
when I'm the leader
ofthis gang.
WHEAT: Heyes, why are we heading
up towards the mountains?
HEYES: So we can drop
the safe off a big one.
Ifthat don't bust her
wide open, nothing will.
Yeah, I hope you're right,
Heyes,
'cause, the way I figure it, we got
the short end of an hour left.
HEYES:
Gotta be here someplace.
Keep looking, fellas. I mean, you
know it's gotta be here. I mean...
We'll find it. Don't worry.
I mean, we pushed her from up there.
She's gotta be down here, right?
The way I figure it, Heyes,
you owe me and the boys
about $50,000.
Now, we ain't got
no time for talking, Wheat,
we only got
time for looking.
Understand?
Yahoo! Here she is, boys!
Here she is!
What? Is she open?
No, she's buried.
"Sure-fire, boys.
Can't miss, boys.
"Ifthis don't work,
nothing will, boys."
Now, Wheat, you said you had
an idea better than Heyes'.
I figure me and the boys
are ready to back you up.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
AII right, men.
Well, the first step
is to
dig up that safe.
Good idea!
Right!
Dig up the safe!
Well, don't let it
eat at you, Heyes.
Maybe he don't have
no second step.
Get over there.
Wheat, may I remind you that
we ain't got too much time.
We already pushed
this 202 off a mountain,
and it didn't so much
as scratch her paint.
Heyes, listen, it's all in
the way you handle things.
Now, you dropped her into the mud.
I'm fixing to aim her on the rocks.
Mean, hard, pointed rocks. She'll
come apart Iike a two-bit barrel.
Wheat, may I point out...
We're ready, Wheat.
Just... I'm running
things now, all right?
AII right, boys,
let her go.
Well, could've been
a lot worse.
How?
Could've been my idea.
Sure making it easy.
Yup.
Maybe it's a trap.
You know, Iwasjust
thinking the same thing.
We better proceed
more cautious from here on.
They're awful smart.
No telling what that bunch
is up to.
Well, I guess that does it.
You two ain't just walking
away from all that money!
No, we're walking away from a posse.
Advise you to do the same.
I don't take advice,
I give it!
And I'm advising you two
to reconsider.
You walk away, we ain't gonna be obliged
to owe you no share in that money.
Well, that seems
fair enough, Wheat.
See you boys later. Wish you
all the Iuck in the world.
Be seeing you again,
if you don't
hang around here too long.
Let her go.
Heyes, what's amnesty?
Huh?
Where'd you get this?
Little old lady from Boston.
Said it could be the end
to all our troubles.
What's amnesty mean?
Well...
Well, what it means is there's more
chicken thieves, land grabbers,
and rag-picking penny stealers
around than there is Iawmen.
So if a man wants
to turn himself in,
governor might see fit
to wipe his slate clean.
"Might" see fit?
Depends on who you are
and what you done.
Oh.
Well, I don't suppose
we'd have a chance.
You don't suppose right.
Hey, good Iuck now!
You better hurry, boys!
"You better hurry, boys."
Better hurry, boys.
CURRY: There's one thing
we gotta get, Heyes.
HEYES: What's that?
CURRY: Out ofthis business!
It's him.
LOM: Come in.
What can I do for you?
Howdy, Lom.
Heyes.
Oh, Lom, no. Is that any way to
say hello after all these years?
Hello, you're under arrest,
and where's the Kid?
Ought to get a lock
for that side door, Lom.
Nice to see you, Lom.
Well, it ain't nice
to see you.
I'm gonna tell you straight
right now, both of you.
If you have a mind to pull
something here in my town,
you'd best be primed to walk
over my body doing it.
Lom, we're friends.
Were friends.
Oh, now, Lom.
We never held it against you. Sporting
a big tin star, big as a hog's head.
Coffee, Lom?
No, thanks.
Yeah, ru...
Well, you know, Lom, we still
think of you as one of us.
Well, what do you want?
What do you know
about this?
Amnesty?
That's a program the governor's
trying out to see if...
You ain't thinking of amnesty
for you two?
Oh, that's for cheap crooks
and small-time grifters.
Oh, well.
Can we help it if we're a
bit better at what we do?
You can't tell me the governor's
gonna penalize us for excellence.
And one thing's for sure.
Whoever does our talking is
gonna have to believe in us.
Does your... Does your talking?
You don't mean me?
Well, hey, Lom.
The only man we know who can look
the guv straight in the eye,
tell him an outlaw
can turn good, and mean it.
It's agirl.
Okay, now, Lom,
you be careful.
LOM: Come in.
May I speak with you,
Sheriff?
Oh, hello, Miss Porter.
Isn't it kind of Iate for you
to be out by yourself?
Oh, I was working Iate.
I'm on my way home now, but...
Oh, I didn't realize that you were
right in the middle of something.
I ain't in the middle of nothing.
These are just a couple of...
Old, old friends.
Well, any friends
ofthe Sheriff's
are instantly put on my list
of preferred acquaintances.
Aren't you going to
introduce us, Lom? Huh?
Oh, sure.
May I present,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones.
This is Miss Porter
of Porterville.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Delighted, ma'am.
Mr. Smith. Mr. Jones.
Actually, Lom, what I came
to talk to you about was
we're handling a very large payroll
at the bank tomorrow and...
Oh, perhaps I should explain,
I'm running the local bank.
And I was thinking we ought to talk about
some additional security measures.
I'm sure we should.
You are the local banker,
ma'am?
In my father's absence, yes.
Well, I'II drop by the bank the first
thing in the morning, Miss Porter,
and look into your
security arrangements.
Oh, that would be fine, Lom.
Although I'm fairly confident
with our big new Brooker safe.
Brooker?
Brooker, ma'am?
HEYES: Not the Brooker 202?
No. The Brooker 404.
Oh...
Brooker 404.
Well, you just
rest assured, ma'am.
There ain't a man in these
parts can open a Brooker 202,
let alone a 404.
Now, how is that, Mr. Smith, that
you know so much about safes?
Well, it's kind of in his
line of work, Miss Porter.
But the Brooker 404
is brand new!
I didn't know anybody knew
anything about them.
It is new to these parts,
but they've had one for some months
at the Mercantile Bank of St. Louis,
and the Farmer's Bank
at Fort Worth, too.
Mr. Smith, you've given
your secret away.
I have?
You are in banking!
Yes.
Yes, you could say that,
couldn't you?
Mr. Smith, given your choice,
would you pick a Brooker safe
or a Magnalock?
I'd pick either one.
Actually, I'm more
in the money end of it.
My partner, Mr. Jones, here,
is the security expert.
An expert? Right here in Porterville?
Well, ma'am...
Oh, Lom, now, you know how I've been
trying to prove myself while Daddy's away.
It's just that,
being only a woman, I...
I feel I need guidance.
Lom, do you think that we might
prevail upon your friends
to take an interest
in our little bank?
Well, I'm sure they'd do
just that, ma'am,
if they were to stay in town.
As it happens, they'll be
leaving real sudden Iike.
However, Lom, since
she is a friend of yours...
And since we do have some unfinished
business with you, Lom...
Then you will take a look
at our security systems?
Oh, with pleasure, ma'am.
First thing in the morning,
ma'am.
I know I'II be in good hands.
Good night.
Good night, Miss Porter.
Good night.
So that's it.
AII this talk about amnesty
is just an excuse
for you to be here
while you set up the bank.
Lom, if you know one thing about me and
the Kid, you know our word is good!
We never come anywhere
near this town before
'cause we didn't want to cause
any trouble for you.
AII right, if you can't help
us now, okay, I understand.
You make our excuses to the lady, tell
her we had to leave town unexpected.
Let's go, Kid.
Wait, boys.
I guess I knew all along that
you stayed out of Porterville
just to keep my record clear.
I suppose one good turn
deserves another.
Then you'll do it?
You'll talk to the governor?
With all the heat he's been getting
from the banks and the railroads,
he might even thank me for coming up with
a way to put you two out of business.
When can you get started?
No sense in waiting. I'II take
the 7:15 train in the morning.
AII right, Lom.
You're a good man.
Yeah, I told you.
I told you.
So long, Lom. Be seeing you.
We'll be waiting right here
for you when you get back.
You know, with your pockets loaded
full of you-know-what, huh?
Well, so long, Smith. So long, Jones.
AII right.
I expect you can stay out
oftrouble till I get back.
Listen, if anything happens,
my deputy's name is Harker.
He's a big blond fellow.
What a worrier.
What could happen?
Got about three more minutes to crack
this safe before the bank opens.
You can't rush
ajob Iike this.
Well, if you can't crack her, I
don't guess she can be cracked.
Well, it looks Iike you got
yourself a real safe safe, ma'am.
Well, I'm very grateful to you
for your efforts, both of you.
Our pleasure, ma'am,
and our business.
Oh, that's so apparent.
Are you satisfied,
Mr. Smith?
Yes, ma'am.
You got your money's worth.
Five tumbler,
sequential action.
But a good dynamiter
could blow it.
Well, he'd have to get through the steel
bars on our windows and our doors first.
Well, I wish we could continue
this discussion,
but if you'll excuse me,
I must open our doors.
HARKER: Hey, gents!
Don't make no move
toward your guns!
And who says so?
Me.
Acting Sheriff
Harker Wilkins.
AII right, you just step right on
in there, gentlemen. That's fine.
Yes, here.
Now, on official orders from
elected Sheriff Lom Trevors,
you are directed
to give me your firearms.
Go on. Unstrap them now.
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
Thank you.
Oh, now, here. You just put that
right back where you got it from.
You best to tell him.
He don't put it back,
he's gonna get in big trouble.
Oh, you best
to put it back, Mr. Jones.
Hmm.
There. Thank you kindly.
Hey, Deputy, would you mind filling
in some ofthe spaces with words?
Yeah, well,
you men is on my list.
Your what list?
Well, my list
of known transients,
placed in myjurisdiction by Sheriff Trevors
to be enacted upon in his absence.
Transients being found
in possession of firearms
while under my
aforementioned jurisdiction,
which is in violation of Article One
ofthe Temporary Transients Act,
and makes them subject to immediate
arrest and imprisonment.
This was Lom's idea?
Relax.
He's just trying to make sure
we stay out oftrouble, huh?
Oh, we're fine without a gun?
Uh-huh.
What other kind of
special rules you got?
Well, now there's Article Two,
which says that ifthere's
any trouble in the whole town,
that's from a busted window
to a throwed horseshoe,
that I am to pick up and
arrest all known transients.
Hey, how many transients
you got on that list?
Two.
Oh, cheer up, Kid.
If it's worth having, it's
worth giving something up for.
Lom's only testing us.
Yeah, he gave us wings
and took away the sky.
Mr. Smith! Mr. Jones!
I'm sorry. We hadn't really
completed our discussions
when I had to break away.
Hadn't we?
No.
I could certainly
use you, in the bank.
You mean to work there?
Inside, ma'am?
But you don't have to make
your decision right now.
We'll take the jobs.
Huh?
Why not? And I for one
am not too proud.
Like Miss Porter says, it's
only till her Pa gets back.
And, well,
look at it this way.
We're strangers
in a strange town,
but inside a bank,
why, we'll be right at home.
Kind of keep our hands
in the... So to speak.
Well, I...
Ma'am, excuse me.
We're really gonna have to talk
this up between the two of us
if you don't mind.
Not at all.
I'm only thrilled you'll even
consider helping me out
in Daddy's absence.
Could I possibly hope for an answer
by the close of business today?
Oh, oh, oh, of course, ma'am.
One way or another.
Yes, of course.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You...
And I still say, why not?
You know, the sooner we grab off
ourselves some regularjobs,
the sooner we gonna get off
that list oftransients,
and the sooner we gonna get
our shooting irons back.
What's old Lom gonna think
we're up to, though,
if he hears we're
working in the bank?
I don't know about
that other one,
but I bet you a dollar
that's Kid Curry.
Just Iike when I seen them
riding through Fort Griffin,
one jump ahead ofthe posse.
Then there's
the constant temptation,
which I ain't sure
I got the strength to resist.
Hey, you,
at the end ofthe bar.
Not you. You.
Me and my friend here just been
wondering who it is you resemble.
Well, my mother mostly.
So they tell me.
Well, now I see
why you don't wear a gun,
when you can shoot off
your mouth that way.
Well, you know
what we got here, Mr. Smith?
We got ourselves a walk-off.
No, no, no,
don't get started.
Walk-off?
I don't Iike that, mister.
And I don't even know
what it means.
Well, then, I'm gonna tell you.
No.
You see when the good Lord
was making men,
he got a whole bunch ofthem
all whomped up together.
And then he decided to knock
off for the rest ofthe day,
thinking he'd put
the brains in later.
But guess what happened?
A whole bunch ofthem critters
just upped and walked off
before he ever got back.
And that's what we got here,
walk-off.
Don't you push him.
You can't back it up.
Sir, I would Iike to apologize
for my friend.
And also want you to be sure
that you keep on noticing
that he ain't wearing a gun.
Neither am I.
Neither am I.
Don't let that stop you, in
case you feel Iike reaching.
Okay, Heyes, step aside.
No! No, you can't.
He's asking for it.
AII right. I'm asking
for something, too.
Something we ain't never
had a chance at before!
We ain't got no chance now
that eyeballer knows who I am!
But he can't be sure. Not unless
you go and prove it for him!
Okay. We'll play it your way.
sir.
Me and my friend been
talking it over
and he'd Iike to apologize.
He'd what?
Yes, sir, that's a fact. I'd Iike
to apologize. I'm very sorry.
I've got a big mouth.
And no guts.
Yes, sir.
No guts.
You'd better be careful when you
stand up on your hind legs that way.
You might be confused
with something human.
Yes, sir.
I'II remember that.
You're right. He isn't the man
I thought he was.
But even so,
I don't Iike that face.
I'II be through here
tomorrow in the a.m.
You'd better make sure it ain't
around here for me to see.
Yes, sir.
lt'Il be missing.
On the house, boys!
And my apologies.
AII my customers
ain't Iike him.
Local boy?
No.
He's ramrodding the 2U herd.
They're camped a couple miles
south of here.
They'II be pushing them beeves
through here in the morning,
so all you gotta do is
stay hid till they're gone
and you won't get hurt.
That's all, huh?
Well, it's decided.
We're taking those bank jobs
'cause I'm not going naked
one more day.
I don't know about that.
I don't know if a transient can
Iegally hold ajob in Porterville.
Well, he can't 'cause the minute
he's got a job, he ain't transient.
Which is what we stopped
being about 10 minutes ago.
You can ask Miss Porter.
So just give us our guns back.
We gotta get to work.
Well, till I get a definite
ruling from the Sheriff...
Oh, here.
He got over to Capitol
and sent a message back. Had
something in it for you boys.
Sent it by telegraph, too.
Says here, "Tell Smith and
Jones everything looks good."
Now, I Iike to keep
my $100 bills in piles of 10,
and my $10 bills
in piles of 100.
And on my righÍ.
I'd Iike to have a pile
of $50 bills, 20 ofthem,
and 20 $50 bills on my left.
And the ones, you keep them...
What's the matter?
Oh, I don't know.
No, nothing, Mr. Pincus. I think
I gotta get some fresh air.
You look a little bilious.
Uh-huh.
I've got green spots
in front of my eyes.
I've got fives and tens.
I don't know if I can take it.
Iwasjust thinking how natural
you looked behind them bars.
Leastwise, I ain't got time
to be tempted by Miss Porter.
Hello. Hello. Mayl
talk to you for a minute?
Mr. Jones, I wonder if we might
get together tonight for dinner?
To discuss security.
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but
I've other plans for tonight.
Who's that?
Me.
What do you want?
Well, first off, I'd Iike you to notice
there ain't nobody around to watch us now.
And I'd Iike you to notice
that I am wearing a gun.
You looking
for trouble?
No.
No, no trouble.
Just here to give you
a little piece of advice.
Don't take this herd
through Porterville.
Take the other road up
through Salt River.
You're given
the orders, mister.
I expect you can back them up.
There's two of us
and one of you.
That's two guns
against one.
That don't hardly seem fair.
Yeah, it's fair.
You see, this gun of mine
shoots two bullets at one time.
Huh? Now, what's that
supposed to mean?
Just what I said.
Here's one.
That's the other one.
That's two.
Get the idea?
Yes, sir.
We'll be going
by way of Salt River.
Thought you might.
Good night, boys.
Well, you can sleep easy.
Them boys ain't gonna be driving
that herd through town after all.
You didn't go up...
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, Ijust suggested
a safer road.
So all our troubles
are over.
I don't Iike it.
Bank sits right there
next to Sheriff's office.
I wish Heyes was here
to think it out.
If I couldn't figure it out better than him
any day of the week, I'd just plum quit.
Tomorrow morning, we'll just
take that little bank
without Hannibal Heyes
and the Kid.
AII right, now.
We're all gonna
just walk in there,
looking innocent and normal.
Well, anyway, we're all
just gonna walk in.
And I'm gonna go first.
I'm gonna sashay
right up to the teller
and I'm gonnatell him to fill
this bag up full of money.
Uh, rest of you,
you... Listen,
why don't you just
stand around,
ready to cover me
in case we have to
shoot our way out?
Ain't you nervous, Wheat?
Huh?
Well, you've never done
first bandit before.
Who's nervous?
I ain't nervous.
Don't move and don't holler,
'cause this is a stickup.
What are
you doing back there?
One thing I ain't doing
is getting robbed.
Put that gun away.
Just read that.
Why do I have
to read that?
I wrote it!
Now, you get out of here.
Now, wait just a minute.
Do you mean to say
that you're...
That you're
Iegally working here?
Yes, I am.
Then you ain't got no right
to tell me not to rob it.
I'm only telling you
as a friend
because this here bank is
protected to the fullest extent
of one fully loaded six-gun
in the hand of
Kid Curry.
If you don't believe me,
just look behind you.
Howdy, boys.
Howdy.
Hi.
I suggest you all
wait outside
while me and Heyes
talk to Wheat there.
Well, I think that's
a good idea.
Yeah.
AII right,
what's the angle?
Amnesty.
Huh?
Amnesty.
Amnesty?
For you two?
Well, we ain't got it yet.
But Lom Trevors, you remember?
He's talking with the governor
right at this very minute.
He's talking to the governor?
For you two?
Well, yeah.
Now, we'd have put in
for you, too,
but we didn't know
where you were.
As soon as we get it, it's a cinch
for you and all the rest ofthem.
'Cause... Well, we're much
bigger crooks than you are.
You really think
we got a chance?
Sure, and tell you what.
You take the boys,
you go Iay Iow
for a couple days.
Well, go over
to Salt River.
And then, as soon as
we get the good word,
we'll bust over on
and tell you.
Ain't that gonna be
a nice surprise?
The happy end
to seven sorry lives of crime.
Glad you see
the advantage, Wheat.
Go on out there
and tell the boys.
Right, right.
We'll be waiting
for the word.
Yeah.
Well, what'd they say?
What are they up to?
They're fixing to rob
the bank without us.
That man you were
talking to
and those other men,
what did they want?
CURRY: Well, they're just
looking for work, ma'am.
Poor devils, we told them
to try Salt River.
Oh, well, they certainly
do seem grateful.
By the way, ma'am.
Sorry I couldn't take you up
on that dinner last night.
But I am free tonight.
How about you and me
doing the town?
Why, I'd love to.
Come on.
Now, wait. What's the idea rousting
a man out of bed Iike that?
You'll see.
Come on, come on.
What, now?
Just...
Just wait a minute.
Miss Porter,
can you get home by yourself?
Well, I usually do, but...
Well, then I'II be saying good
night to you now. Sorry, ma'am.
Never mind.
Hey, what's the trouble?
You'll see. Come on.
Look at them.
Give me a good one.
Okay.
A pair of eights good?
So, what's wrong with them?
Who are they?
Transients.
Listen, they was over to the bank
this morning looking for work.
And don't you deny it because
I've got a full report.
Who's denying it?
We told them to go over
to Salt River.
Yeah, but they didn't do it.
Come here.
Bartender here tells me
they've been sitting
right in that spot
for 14 hours.
Well, that doesn't make it
our responsibility.
Yeah, but I got a feeling
that you know who they are.
What?
I said.
I got a feeling
that you know who they are.
Yeah, how come?
Well, 'cause
two oftheir horses
got the same brand
on them as yours have.
Now...
We bought them broomtails
off a herd
must have been 2,000 strong.
Now, it's just likely
somebody else bought a couple.
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but,
they're still transients.
And as such,
is subject to all the rules
and regulations
applying to same.
So, I got to go in there
and take their guns.
He's about to get
his head blowed off.
Well, now, boys, I'II just
have to take your guns
until you decide
to ride out of town.
Where did you hear that?
Special rules
and regulations
pertaining to the
Temporary Transients Act.
And in this town, you boys
is knowed as transients.
Well, Kid.
Looks Iike it's time
for us to stand up
and be counted
on his side ofthe Iaw.
Let's go.
Transients?
Sounds Iike a hanging offense
if ever I heared one.
Nothing serious
Iike that at all.
Just means I got to
take your guns.
Oh, I guess...
lfthem's the rules,
I guess we didn't
know the rules.
Well, we'd be more than
happy to oblige, Sheriff.
That's all there is to it.
You'll see.
Thank you.
Thank you kindly, gentlemen.
There we are.
Thank you very kindly.
There, now. You see there? Transients
ain't necessarily hostile.
Hmm?
I thought you was gonna
wait over at the Salt River.
What difference does it make,
as long as we're waiting?
Oh, I don't know.
But do you have to do it right here?
Right out in public?
AII right,
I'II tell you the truth.
We just about busted.
And me and my horse is
just plum stove in.
Those few miserable dollars
Iying out there on that table,
that's all the cash we've got
in the world between us.
So?
So we can't...
We can't afford
no place to stay.
But you see,
if we just sit here
passing the same few
miserable dollars
back and forth
between us,
buying a short beer
every now and then, well,
we can't get throwed out.
And we have got
a roof over our heads.
Just as long as we don't
let no one else in the game
who might walk off
with what little we got.
Yeah.
Now, hey, come on. Now, now,
don't be so down, you know.
You won't have long to wait.
Now, Lom's gonna be back
tomorrow night, 11:15 train.
You just sit tight, huh?
Yeah, well, we're just
sitting here waiting.
AII right. Okay.
AII right, gentlemen,
what's the name ofthis game?
Yes, sir.
It's them transients. They're still
sitting around that poker table.
About 22 hours now.
Must be a big game.
No, ain't never been
more than $12 in the pot.
And it look Iike
they discourage new money.
I can't figure that out.
Well, maybe
they're waiting for someone.
Or got nothing better
to do.
Look, you got their guns,
they're staying put.
What more do you want?
Yeah.
I sure will be glad that Sheriff
gets back tonight, though.
Yeah.
Time Lom's train pulls in,
we're gonna be sitting
smack under that safe,
scooping out money
instead of dirt.
Well, whatever Lom
tells us
when we meet that train
tonight,
we better not plan
on staying here.
Now, where are they going?
HEYES:
The whole bunch ofthem
going into the Sheriff's
office without being dragged?
Oh! Howdy, gents.
Oh, these here transients,
they're just leaving town
right now. Weren't you?
Yeah, we just heard
they're taking on hands
over to the Tumble T.
So, we're on our way.
Just stopped by
to pick up our hardware.
WHEAT: Nice meeting you,
gents. So we just...
Oh, listen, Mr. Deputy.
Mmm-hmm?
You wouldn't mind,
would you,
if we just have ourselves
maybe just one little
extra hand of poker before we left town?
I mean, would you?
Oh, I reckon not. You boys sure
have been cooperative and all.
Yeah, of course, I'II have
to take my leave of you.
See, I've got to make my
rounds and then be down there
at 11:15 to meet
the Sheriff's train.
Yeah, well, you just
tell that Sheriff,
as far as we're concerned, he can just
leave you in charge any old time.
Well, now, thank you, gents.
Thank you, yes.
That's fine.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, Sheriff.
They're a fine bunch
of fellows there.
Yeah, they're winners.
HEYES: AII right.
Just a bit.
How come you sit still
for 36 hours,
then pick a time Iike this
to decamp?
We're not going no place.
You given much thought
to what's gonna happen
when Lom gets back?
I mean, if you ain't
got that amnesty?
Figured we'd better
have our guns, just in case.
Afraid they got
a point there, Heyes.
Yeah, we'll just be waiting at
the poker table Iike we was.
Hey, howdy!
Hey, what you got there?
I got a telegram
for Deputy Wilkins.
HEYES: Well, right in here.
CHARLEY: Foryou, Harker,
from Lom.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, thank you
very much, Charley.
You're welcome.
What's it say?
Well,
you're both under arrest.
Now, you ain't even told us
what we're charged with.
Well, you'll have to talk
to the Sheriff about that.
Now, I got to go
make my rounds
and I'II be back directly.
I'II have him with me.
Well, then, Ieastwise, you can
tell us what the telegram said.
Yeah.
Read it for yourself.
"Arrest Smith and Jones
and hold
"incommunicado till I
get back tonight
"on the 11:15.
Sheriff Trevors."
He sold us out, Kid.
He never even intended
to get us amnesty.
He was just back there
trying to build up our prices
with the banks and railroads
before he cashes us in.
So here we're set,
done in.
Come to the end of our road,
and it took a friend
to bring us down.
Now, we gonna teach
Lom a Iesson.
I say we blow that bank
right now.
Right, that'II
show folks he should have
stuck around here
doing his job
instead of going off to the
Capitol to feather his nest.
Yeah, we'll round up
the rest ofthe boys...
No.
But...
No, we gotta
keep them out ofthis.
How come?
Well, don't you see?
They're trying so hard
to go straight,
hoping for amnesty.
Now, we ain't got no right to
go wrecking their chances now.
No, Kid, this is one bank
we gotta blow by ourselves.
You know, Heyes,
you've got a real big heart.
Yeah.
I can see it! We're
smack-dab under the safe.
There she is.
We're right on top of her.
We know the Deputy's
gonna be waiting
at the station at 11:15.
It's a good three minutes
from the station to the bank.
It should give us
just time enough
to grab the money and run
before Lom gets back.
So, that's when we blow it up.
At exactly 11:15.
WHEAT: 11:05.
I don't know, Wheat. That's
an awful lot of dynamite.
Yeah, that's an awful
lot of safe we got up there.
KYLE: We'll be long gone out
ofthis tunnel when she blows.
It's gonna be a big one.
CURRY: You sure we ain't
overdoing it?
Kid, may I remind you,
we are dealing with
a Brooker 404.
There. Howdy, Harker.
Howdy, Sheriff.
You arrest those two fellows
Iike I said?
I sure did.
Everything's under control.
You all right?
I don't feel a thing.
HEYES: What happened?
I can't figure it out, Kid.
I don't know, Heyes.
But it must have been
awful good dynamite.
That's what happened, Heyes.
They're what happened.
AII right, boys.
That don't belong to you.
Nowjust Ieave the money
where it is.
Try and stop us.
HEYES: Don't you dare,
Wheat.
Don't you dare!
Go on, go on.
Go on, get!
CURRY: Put it down,
you heard him.
Get! Go on! Get!
And don't come back.
And don't try that again.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, you were wonderful!
You were wonderful!
You were wonderful!
Just the two of you
against those men.
Lom, you should have seen it.
I saw it all.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones
saved the bank.
They fought along those
outlaws side-by-side.
"Put that down," they said.
"That doesn't belong to you."
They fought for that moneyjust
Iike it was their very own.
LOM: Uh-huh?
Well, I think even the governor might
be interested in what they did.
I'd Iike
to discuss that, boys,
if you wouldn't mind stepping
into my office for a moment.
Yahoo, we got it!
We did get the amnesty.
Yes, uh-huh.
But, please, please,
don't tell me anything
about what happened
here tonight.
Hey, Lom.
Yeah?
One thing, though.
If we did get the amnesty,
how come
you had us arrested?
Well, I was afraid
the governor's telegram
would get here before I did,
setting out the terms.
And I was afraid
the terms might scare you off
before I could explain
about it.
Terms?
What terms?
Well,
you've been granted
provisional amnesty.
Course, the governor can't come
flat out and give you amnesty now
without Ietting himself in
for a lot of criticism.
So...
First, you gotta prove
you deserve it.
Till then, only you and me
and the governor will know.
It'Il be our secret.
Secret.
How long?
The governor figures a year.
Figures if you can stay
out oftrouble for 12 months,
you can do it forever.
Then you got it,
the whole thing.
Fresh start,
clean bill of health, amnesty.
So, all we've got to do is just
stay out of trouble for one year.
But we'll still be wanted.
We'll still be blamed for
everything that goes wrong.
We'll still be
the same men we was
before you talked
to the governor?
That's true.
But it's only for 12 months.
You can do it, boys.
I'm sure you can.
Just Iike you stayed
out oftrouble
for the last few days
right here in Porterville.
Now, that wasn't so hard,
really, was it?
