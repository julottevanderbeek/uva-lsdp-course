Fritz Lang's third feature film...
and the first to establish his
reputation as one of Germany's...
foremost silent directors.
Lang's work on ...
prevented him from directing
the expressionist classic...
,
a film that had been assigned to him...
by producer Erich Pommer.
The credits of ,
however, include several names...
famous by , such
as Set Designer Hermann Warm and...
actress Lil Dagover. Filmed in
in two parts designed to be shown
on two different theatre dates.
Lang's plans to complete
the serial story with a third...
and fourth part to be titles
and ...
were unfortunately
never realized.
The film's obsession with
diabolical evil directed by...
a powerful but unseen force
is a foreshadowing...
of the  films
made by Lang three years later...
Part of a series of adventure
films in exotic locations...
popular in Germany at the time,

The message in the bottle.
The Standard Club of
San Francisco...
...on the evening before
the great America-Japan Regatta.
Lio Sha.
"Where is Kay Hoog, the favorite
in tomorrow's race?"
Kay Hoog.
"Kay Hoog lives only for sport.
He's probably forgotten...
...all about tonight's party amid
the preparation for tomorrow's race."
"Each of you knows the great
importance of a message in a bottle...
It is the last attempt of shipwrecked
sailors to send a message."
"Today as I headed toward shore
aboard my yacht..."
"I hurried home
to open the bottle."
To whomever finds this:
Please notify Harvard University...
Cambridge Massachusetts,
immediately that I was taken...
prisoner here near
the 75th longitude by
descendants of the Incas...
who by tradition still faithfully
offer human sacrifice to the sun.
Unbelievable treasures lie buried
below the ruins of their temples...
which are probably inherited
from their old King...
Beneath the so-colled "Holy Sea"
extends a gold mine, which
appears to be inexhaustible.
Today I escaped my torturers
and made it to the coast...
In the name of God, help me.
May 5, 1918.   Fred Johnson.
"I found the point on a map..."
"and wired Harvard University
immediately."
"As proof that this mystery
really exists. I have the reply."
Professor Johnson
has been missing...
for six months from Peru
expedition.   Harvard University
"Consequently, I will not be
in tomorrow's race
for the Golden Trophy...
of San Francisco. The golden
treasures of the ancient Incas
are far more inviting."
Mouton Rothschild, 1863.
"Good luck, Kay Hoog."
"A broken glass means luck."
That night.
The next morning.
"Do not interfere
with the Spiders' business."
Dr. Telphas.
"The assembly of Spiders
is waiting for you."
"Report on our nighttime visit
to Hoog and show the captured
document...
Inform the Spiders precisely
of my plans. The golden treasure
must be ours."
"At the Master's order, Lio Sha
has convened this meeting...
to inform you
of an important matter."
"The Master wants you to finance
this undertaking immediately...
so that we can get
there ahead of Kay Hoog."
The two expeditions prepare.
"Cuicatlan is the southern-most
station of the South Mexican Railway."
"The line was built by the government
to establish a connection...
to a balloon station where
meteorilogical measurements
are taken."
"I will lead the expedition
myself, and you will
accompany me, Dr. Telphas."
On board the scenic car
of the South Mexican Railway.
A telegram arrives for
Harry Rongoon.
"Paging Mr. Rongoon! Paging
Mr. Rongoon!"
A chance reunion.
"I am employed by the meteorological
station in Cuicatlan. I fly
a measurement balloon."
"My next mission is a flight
over the Crated Mountains...
...of the Cordillares in Chile."
In the bar of Cuicatlan.
The Spiders recruit.
"Gentlemen! Twenty dollars per day
and a hundred dollars bonus!"
"If you want to go along,
you have to be on time.
I leave at exactly 6 o'clock."
"Free the balloon!"
The next day,
over the Cordillares.
"This is a document written
in peculiar characters that
I took from the Spiders...
in the bar. As much as
I can make out, it is about
a mysterious diamond ship."
The Spiders' expedition.
"It's not enough that we have Kay Hoog
opposing us for the gold treasure...
Now he also has the key to our
biggest secret, the diamond ship."
"Where the sun sets in the west...
lies the Holy Sea upon
which no man has ever sailed."
"Every morning in the sun's
first rays there bathes in the sea...
the Priestess of the Sun...
a golden woman... Eldora."
The ruined city
of the old Incas.
"If you really want to..."
Naela, Priestess of the Sun,
arrives to bathe in the Holy Sea.
Again the great day comes which
occurs every fifty-two suns,
the Great Festival of the Sun."
"We will make a human sacrifice,
so that the race of the Incas...
will again become great and
renew its ancient splendor."
"Flee from here. Save yourself.
Death waits for you here."
"Flee, otherwise you are lost! No white
man has ever left this valley alive."
And Kay Hoog saw...
"You will never leave here alive.
In three days is the Great Festival...
of the Sun... where your heart
will be sacrificed."
"Tell us how
you took her prisoner..."
"During the nigt I saw smoke rising.
I investigated and saw..."
"On the day of the Great Festival
the blood of the prisoners will stain...
the sacrificial rock and you. Priestess
of the Sun, will offer the sacrifice."
"I offer flowers which are pure
and white, as sacrifice. But the blood...
of a man? Kill?... Me?
Let there be no sacrifice."
"You must sacrifice them to the sun,
so our people will be great...
and powerful.
Again as in time past."
"Flee! Flee!"
"I will save you,
as you saved me."
The gold mine
under the Holy Sea.
"The holy candles must not burn.
They bring death."
"No one will find us here.
This is the sanctuary of...
the Priestess of the Sun,
which none may enter."
An underground waterfall.
"Let me go with you...
far away from here."
And Lio Sha?
"All exits are guarded...
it is impossible to escape."
"Then there is only one way out!
The waterfall must have an outlet..."
"Since her childhood I have trained
Naela for this day. I know how
to force her."
The Sun Festival.
"I will personally come
to get you, that we may make
the sacrifice to the sun."
"O Mighty Sun!"
"Gold! Gold!"
The holy candles are burning.
"Gold! Gold!"
"Come to your senses men!
Everyone will get his share
of the treasure!"
The survivors.
And Kay Hoog...
Afterwards.
Weeks later...
back in San Francisco.
"You still have a secret document
of the Spiders. I am here to get it."
"The Diamond Ship document?
It's in good hands."
"We shouldn't be enemies
any longer. You saved my life.
I love you, Kay Hoog."
"There is my heart
and my love."
"Beware Kay Hoog. You have
rejected Lio Sha's love...
now fear her fate."
"I'll be back soon, Naela.
It's urget that I go to the city."
And when Kay Hoog returned...
"Where is Naela?"
"Naela!"
The sign of the Spiders.
"Lio Sha... you will pay
dearly for this!"
For the further adventures of Kay
Hoog and his revenge on Lio Sha...
