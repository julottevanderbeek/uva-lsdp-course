NARRATOR: In 1848,
the United States and Mexico
signed a peace treaty
That opened up
the great Southwest
to the wagons of the pioneers.
But when they came
to occupy it,
They found
a lot of other early Americans
Who didn't know or care
about our deal with Mexico.
They had the idea
it was their country.
So one day a wagon train
with an Army escort
was attacked.
They buried their dead
where they fell.
OFFICER: Fire!
Then they pushed on
to Fort Gardner,
One of the military outposts
that dotted the trail
to California.
But there was
something mysterious
about this attack.
Something that set it apart
from all previous raids
on wagon trains.
So Colonel Pollard,
commandant of the post,
Ordered
an immediate investigation.
Your attention, please.
This is Major Davison,
Captain Laurence,
And our confidential
liaison officer,
Mr. James Eagle,
Who, being part
Indian himself,
Has been of
great assistance to us
in Indian matters.
Now, the reason
for this inquiry
is simply this,
There is evidence
that a spy was
operating in your camp
The night
of the attack.
Now, Captain Weightman,
have you any suspicion
as to the guilty person?
Nothing on which
I could base
a formal accusation, sir.
Well, I have.
You don't have to search
no further. There's your spy!
That murdering redskin!
Silence, please.
Mr. Simms,
I'll have to ask you
to restrain yourself.
Uh, Crockett,
I understand this Indian
Has acted as
your assistant scout
in other expeditions?
That's right, sir.
Red Hawk and me,
we sort of grew up together.
He's a Cherokee.
When he was a boy,
his village was wiped out
by Comanches.
Some missionaries
brought him up.
I'd stake my life on him.
Well, that... that's
a strong statement.
CROCKETT:
I can back it up, sir.
POLLARD: Go ahead.
Well, we hadn't had
a mite of trouble till we hit
the Kiowa Indian country.
We were rolling along
through the San Juan Valley.
CROCKETT: I had been scouting
out ahead with Tex McGee,
the civilian wagon boss,
And we didn't like
what we ran into.
We rode in to report
to the Captain
That what used to be
a friendly Indian village
had plumb disappeared.
I was just trying
to convince the Captain
That the time
to worry about Indians
is when they ain't
where they ought to be
When Red Hawk rode in
from scouting the hills
on our north flank.
The tribes gather
at council fires.
They talk of war
against all white men.
Any sign
of Sleeping Fox's village?
They are making
a new camp
to the north.
Braves paint their faces
for the warpath.
Reckon I better
ride out and have
a powwow with them.
It's worth trying,
Crockett.
See if you can find out
what's back of all this.
The Army will round up
the leaders and hang them.
Looks like it'll take
a heap of rounding up,
Captain.
Come on, Hawk,
let's head for those rocks.
CAPTAIN: Troupe, forward!
CROCKETT: We rode
a good five miles
into the hills
And never saw a feather
or a pony track.
Reckon it's us
that got rounded up.
Looks like Sleeping Fox
invited us to a party
whether we like it or not.
Lead the horses back
to those rocks.
Why you lead soldiers
and white wagons
into my people's country?
Soldiers go to
Fort Gardner.
White wagons go to
Land of Setting Sun.
They mean no harm
to your people,
Sleeping Fox.
Many tribes meet
at council fire
under new chief.
The word has passed.
It is war.
Go, tell your people
to turn back
before it's too late.
Sorry, Chief,
our orders are to go ahead.
Then you will not
go back.
CROCKETT: I didn't know
whether he was bluffing
or not,
But I didn't have
to wait long
to find out.
Pick off the chiefs.
Might turn them back.
CROCKETT: After that
one charge, Sleeping Fox
wasted no more men on us.
He figured he had us
sewed up anyway.
By dark, Sleeping Fox
had half the braves
of his tribe with him.
And I knew
if we didn't get out
before sun-up,
We wouldn't get out at all.
Not many
shots left, Hawk.
Thanks, Davy.
Let's get him
on your horse,
Red Hawk.
CROCKETT: That dead Indian
gave us just the one chance
we needed.
We drew straws to see
which one of us was to
lead the Indians a-chase,
And Red Hawk won.
If you can shake them off,
meet me at the head
of the canyon.
I'll make it on foot
across the rim rock.
All right, Davy.
Good luck.
Thanks.
CROCKETT: I made it
over the rim rock all right
and found my horse there.
Red Hawk had done a good job
of fooling the war party
And met me
at the mouth of the canyon.
I left him to scout
the hills, while I rode on
to warn the camp.
Halt or I'll fire.
It's Davy, you idgit!
Hello, Captain.
Why, Crockett,
I'm glad to see you.
I'm glad to see
you, too, Captain.
I was just about
to write down
in my report
That you were missing
in line of duty.
Not quite,
but pretty close.
Did they get Red Hawk?
No, no, he's out
scouting Indians for me
while I came in to report.
We're in for trouble,
Captain.
Looks like the trouble's
already started.
Evening, ma'am.
Good evening.
Hurt or anything?
Guess I'm all
in one piece.
Your husband,
is he all right?
He's not my husband.
He's a driver
I hired in St. Louis.
Oh.
Hey, if you cuss
those horses
a little, mister,
They'll slow down
a lot quicker.
He can't understand you,
he's a deaf-mute.
You mean, you came
all the way through
Indian country alone?
Why, yes.
Hundreds of miles alone,
and you've still
got your hair.
MAN: Anybody get hurt?
Take it easy, folks.
The lady is too
excited to answer a lot
of questions, right now.
A couple of you men,
take care of the horses.
Hey, your driver had
better get some rest.
He will.
How did you ever happen
to leave St. Louis alone?
Well, there aren't
many ways
For a girl
with no family
to earn a living
And I thought
with all the migration west,
There might be a need
for schoolteachers.
You, a schoolmarm?
Is that so startling?
Yes, ma'am, it sure is.
Now, how did I ever
get the idea
That a schoolmarm
looked like
a last year's bird nest?
Guess maybe education
is nicer
than I figured it was.
Oh, Captain Weightman,
this is Miss Frances Oatman.
Come all the way
from St. Louis
to join our outfit.
Congratulations on your
narrow escape, Miss Oatman.
TEX: Davy!
We lost them
in the rocks, Davy,
But I stopped
on the way back
And lifted the hair
of the one you four-footed.
You mean you scalped him?
Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't scalp 'em.
I just cut off
their pigtails,
Make hatbands and pretties
for my bridle.
Miss Oatman, I should
like a detailed report
on what happened,
For my dispatches East.
Would you mind
coming to headquarters?
Not at all, Captain.
Yonder goes something
I never would believe, Tex.
A schoolmarm
that's pretty
as a picture.
Hey now, you... you ain't gone
and fell without even
firing a shot, have you?
You're aiming
to get yourself hog-tied.
Maybe, but
I aim to get me
some education.
Well, sir, I reckon
that's about all
till the night of the attack.
Colonel, can't we
get down to business?
My wife's out there
bad hurt,
And there's
the sneaking devil
that brought it on her.
Mr. Simms, we all understand
and sympathize with you,
But this is
an investigation,
not a trial.
Why don't you ask him
what he was doing
up in the hills
With his Injun friends
for two days.
They didn't jump us
until the night he came back.
Red Hawk,
is that true?
Yes, sir.
I tried to learn who is
the leader uniting the tribes
in war upon the whites.
But with no success?
No, sir,
but there is such a man.
I heard them speak of him.
When was this?
HAWK:
The night of the attack.
Go on, tell us about it.
I had picked up
the blood trail of one of
Sleeping Fox's Indian braves.
HAWK: It led me
to a meeting place
in the mountains.
They spoke of many guns
and much ammunition
the new Chief had given them.
They were planning
to attack the wagon train.
Camp was made
that night near Red Butte.
They had no idea that
danger was so near at hand.
Kind of
a happy camp, tonight.
Isn't it?
Yeah, I wonder why
it can't always be
peaceful like this.
There's a powerful lot
of land in this country.
Enough for everybody.
Indians and whites alike.
If they'd only
portion it out.
That's been tried,
by treaties.
The settlers
always move into
the Indian's lands.
Yeah, I aim to do something
about that some day.
I'd like to go to Washington
like my uncle did,
the famous Davy Crockett.
Oh, Hawk.
This is Red Hawk,
my assistant scout.
He does all
the hard work
for me.
Miss Oatman joined
our outfit
the night we had
Our little ruckus
with Sleeping Fox.
Excuse us, ma'am.
Red Hawk's been out
in the hills
for two days,
And I reckon
I'd better get him
some grub.
What did you
find out, Hawk?
War party, Kiowas.
Many braves.
How far away?
In hills just beyond camp.
They come to attack tonight.
Are you sure?
I heard them talk.
We'd better go
tell the Captain.
HAWK: The Captain ordered
the camp on the alert
And doubled the guard
on the horses.
The plan was to
make the Kiowas think
The camp was asleep
and unprepared,
But every man
was ready and waiting.
It was ordered that
no one should shoot
Until the Captain himself
fired the signal gun.
What makes you
so sure they'll attack
from this side?
My guess is they'll try
to run off the horses.
Cavalry and wagons
ain't much good
without horses.
You're still alive,
you murdering devil.
You'll never shoot
another innocent woman
and kid ever again.
Simms, get a hold of yourself.
It don't do no good,
clubbing a dead Indian.
I'd like to stomp him
right in the ground.
Him and everyone like him.
Come on, now, Simms.
Come on.
This shadow you saw,
Could you tell
whether it was a man,
woman or child?
No, sir.
It moved,
then it was gone.
This dispatch case
has been tampered with.
I always use the old
cavalryman's trick
Of wrapping a horse hair
around the buckle
when I put my papers away.
You can see for yourself,
the horse hair's gone, and
the papers are disarranged.
When did you last
close the case?
This evening
when I left the tent
to go to supper.
Well, whoever it was
must have come in
under the back wall
During the attack.
Come on, Hawk, let's see
if we can find any tracks.
HAWK: Crockett and I
found footprints
leading out from camp.
Someone had contacted Indians
during the fight.
POLLARD: Is that
about all you have
to tell us, Red Hawk?
Yes, sir.
There was nothing else?
No, sir.
Colonel Pollard,
is this court going to
take an Injun's word?
I'll take his word.
Well, I saw him
at the Captain's tent.
Those moccasin prints,
doesn't that pin it on him?
No more than it pins it
on a lot of other people who
wear moccasins around camp.
Like me.
Mr. Simms, you're making
the accusations.
Suppose you tell us
what you were doing
through the attack.
I was busy watching
my wife get shot down.
POLLARD:
Let's proceed
with the investigation.
Here, here now,
easy.
That might go off
and scare somebody.
POLLARD: Simms,
under the circumstances
We'll excuse you
from the rest of the hearing.
Well, gentlemen,
We've examined
all the witnesses
and got nowhere.
A dispatch
from Great Plains, sir.
That's all.
Well, there can
no longer be any doubt
that there was a spy
And that he made
good use
of the information
He got from
your dispatches, Weightman.
The Indians
of the Great Plains area
are on the move.
Colonel, did you
ever hear of Indians
messing around
With military dispatches?
Never.
No, it looks almost like
some white man's brain's
back of all this.
What's your opinion,
Mr. Eagle?
Men of many tribes
bring their furs
to my trading post.
I have heard some talk
of local unrest,
but nothing more.
You don't seem
to take much stock
In this new chief
uniting the tribes
in a general uprising, eh?
Frankly, no.
Oh, Crockett...
Now, you've been
through this country before,
I must send fresh supplies
and ammunition
to Great Plains.
Can heavily loaded wagons
get through Manitou Pass?
Yeah, you can make it
all right, Colonel.
The long way around,
through South Pass,
is easier going.
There ain't no call for you
to feel low-down, Hawk.
Nobody suspects you
except that tenderfoot Simms.
He's just Injun-jumpy.
I'd like to clear away
even his suspicions.
Got any ideas
how to do it?
No.
Have you?
Who me? All I know about
is horses and wagons.
You take the schoolmarm's
team there, for instance.
What about them?
Oh, nothing, except when
she come rearing into camp
that night
Them horses were
sure galloping mighty fresh
For a team what drug a wagon
all the way from St. Louis.
She may have changed
horses somewhere.
Ain't no livery stable
this side of Santa Fe
that I knows of.
MAN: Howdy, Miss Oatman.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to frighten you.
I'm not easily frightened,
but you popped out
so suddenly.
I was just thinking of you
and there you were.
I've been wanting to tell you
since the hearing,
that I, for one,
Never had any doubts
about you.
That is good to hear.
It would be better still
if I had no doubts about you.
Oh, that sounds
so mysterious.
What is your tribe?
My tribe?
It is difficult for one
of Indian blood to hide it
from another Indian.
I felt it
the first time I saw you.
My father is
half Dakota.
My mother was white.
And the name, "Oatman"?
It was my mother's
family name.
I've used it since
I was sent to white schools,
since I was a little girl.
Why are you ashamed
of your Indian blood?
I'm not, I'm proud of it.
But why boast about it
among people who are
prejudiced and suspicious?
If that is your only secret,
It will be safe with me.
Well,
what else could there be?
When the hungry fox hunts,
He overlooks no tracks.
Where you been?
Chief been waiting for you.
I...
TEX: I'll take care of him
for you, Davy.
Is something
troubling you, Davy?
What would you say, Hawk,
if I told you I don't think
that driver of Miss Oatman's
Is deaf or dumb?
I would say what troubles
you most is the question,
Does the girl know it?
I ain't made any secrets
as to how I feel about her.
Why do you think
the man is false?
Because I saw
an Indian stableman at Eagle's
corral talking to him.
Did this man, Ben,
also talk?
No.
No, he just made signs
and noises like
he does around camp.
But it looked like
he could hear, and
if he can hear, he can talk.
An Army doctor
told me that.
It should be easy enough
to trap this man.
Yeah.
Yeah, wait here.
Hello, Miss Frances.
Hello, Davy.
Meet my twin sister, Maggie.
She don't favor
you much.
Well, we're
the same size.
Funny, I can't get used
to that driver of yours
being deaf and dumb.
How'd you ever happen
to hire him, anyhow?
Well, for one thing,
I knew I'd be pretty safe
Coming across Indian
country with him.
Yeah, how does
that figure?
Why, didn't you know
that Indians never
harm anyone
Mentally
or physically afflicted?
What do you know,
I forgot all about that.
But it's true.
Old Jim Bridger got away
from a whole mess
of Blackfoot Indians
By pretending
he'd gone crazy.
FRANCES:
Of course, that war party
that chased us into your camp
Didn't give me a chance
to explain about Ben.
Yeah, I reckon Ben takes
a lot of explaining.
Doggone my hide, I...
I'd forgotten all about
this spare gun of mine
having a hair-trigger.
I hope I didn't scare
you none, ma'am.
Not as much
as it did you.
I'd better
have this thing fixed,
before I shoot somebody.
Accidental-like.
Well, Hawk, I'm sure glad
to get that off my mind.
It is good to see
my friend happy again.
Afternoon, Captain.
Afternoon, Crockett.
The Colonel and I
have decided to hold back
our choice of routes
Until we come
to the fork in the trail.
That's a good idea.
And if anyone should
want to know before then?
Report it to me at once.
That in itself
would be suspicious.
Yes, sir.
Be ready to roll
at sunrise.
I'll be ready, sir.
Tex?
TEX: Oh!
Better ride
into town and
round up your pilgrims,
We roll at sun-up.
Column, right!
Stay back here,
and keep moving, Tex.
I'll ride forward
with the Captain.
All right, Davy.
Their last water camp
will be at Indian Springs.
Then they'll have
to decide what route
they're going to take.
We'll be at camp
close by.
Get our horses
and pack ponies ready,
we're leaving tonight.
Reckon you'll have
this dress ready
for the Virginia Reel
With your prize scholar
when we get to Great Plains?
That depends on
how long it takes.
I can't sew
while we're rolling
And I'll need at least
three evenings to finish it.
Ah, you're sure going to cut
a dash among the gold braid
boys in that outfit.
Reckon I won't even
have a look in.
Now, there's no use
fishing like that.
I won't promise you a dance
Until you finish
that English composition
I told you to write.
Oh, she's did.
Davy, "She's did."
Well, she's done.
It's done.
This composition
isn't feminine.
Well, she's sure
all about a female.
So I see.
It's a beautiful
composition, Davy.
Your teacher is
proud of you.
Well, I know it ain't
spelled very good,
I always get into trouble
with them little
tadpole letters, "g" and "p."
Can't remember which side
their head's turned on.
Maybe my head's turned
the wrong way, too.
Give me a chance
to study this, and I'll
correct it as soon as I can.
Well, I ought to get
A for effort anyhow.
All of that,
And that dance
at Great Plains, too.
Well, that makes me
as happy as a horned toad
on a hot rock.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Teacher kept you
after school, didn't she?
Tex, do you reckon
I can get me some store-bought
clothes in Great Plains?
Store-bought clothes?
Mr. Crockett,
the Captain
wants to see you.
Maybe he'll lend you
a stovepipe hat,
you gall-darned dude.
Store-bought clothes!
Crockett,
from our camp here,
at Indian Springs,
How long will it take us
to reach the mouth
of Manitou Pass?
Well, we ought to
be there
by noon tomorrow.
Looks like
a perfect place
for an ambush.
Yeah.
Yeah, the devil himself
couldn't have built
a better one.
Captain,
let's play it safe
and go through South Pass.
If they attack there
we'll stand a good chance
to beat them off.
Very well, Crockett.
South Pass it is.
The only thing is, sir,
we'll have to let
the camp know tonight,
So we can take on water.
South Pass is bone-dry.
That means
we'll be letting
the spy know as well.
Hawk and I'll keep
a close watch.
You know,
this may smoke him out.
Right.
If we don't learn
who it is before
we get to Great Plains,
We'll never know.
Go to it.
Yes, sir.
We're going by way
of South Pass, folks.
Hello, Davy,
you and the Captain
playing checkers again?
Ah, sort of.
Figuring out which pass
we'll head for
When we hit the fork
in the trail tomorrow.
Oh? You didn't decide,
I suppose.
CROCKETT:
Yeah, we sure did.
Looks like you'll get
that dress finished
in time for our dance.
We're going the long way,
through South Pass.
Say, what's the idea
of dragging this thing
out three extra days?
Two things, Simms.
South Pass
is an easy wagon trail
and open country.
No place for an ambush.
Tex.
Mmm?
Spread word around camp
to fill all the water barrels
before we roll in the morning.
There'll be three
dry camps in a row.
No sleep for you and me
tonight, Hawk.
Do you think the spy might
try to pass that news on
to the Kiowa?
It wouldn't surprise me
a bit if the big wolf
of the Kiowas
Was out there
in the hills now
waiting for it.
In the dark,
wolf and coyote
look alike.
Yeah, but tonight,
we're weasel-trapping.
You watch this half
of the circle,
I'll take the other.
And if someone
should leave camp?
Follow and
bring them back.
I'll slip out
and join High Tree.
If Crockett trails me,
we'll lead him
far off the track.
When things are quiet,
I'll get away myself.
One of us
has to get word
to my father.
Welcome to my fire.
I was watching you
and Davy Crockett.
You didn't tell him
about me, did you?
No, but you are wrong
in thinking it would
turn his heart against you.
Oh, if I thought that,
there would be no problem.
I like him very much,
but I'm not in love with him.
Isn't it too soon to know
where your heart
will lead you?
It doesn't take long
for a girl to know that.
In its hurry
to reach the shining river,
The mountain brook
makes many mistakes.
But all the time
it knows where it's going,
And nothing can keep
the brook and the river
apart for long.
Good night.
Good night.
We only got his horse.
Watch for him
at the head of the canyon.
This is the same gun
you couldn't hear
at Gardner the other day,
And it's still got
a hair-trigger.
That don't work anymore,
you good-for-nothing
renegade.
You heard the stone
I threw. Come on,
now, speak up.
Oh, so you want to
play Indian, do you?
Come on, weasel.
Well, I can't knock
a runt like you around,
But I can
sure play Indian
with you.
Come on, now.
This is a favorite game
of those Kiowas
you've been helping out.
When I cut the next one,
I don't know
whether she'll hold or not.
So you better start talking.
Who were you
taking that information to?
Well, have it
your own way.
But you're taking
an awful chance.
Well, what do you know.
She's still holding.
Well, here goes nothing.
Wait, don't.
I'll talk.
This is my daughter.
It was she who
made our plans possible
By learning
the white Chief's secrets.
Did you bring
the information I want?
Yes.
They're taking the long way,
by South Pass.
You're sure?
It was announced
tonight.
Where is Ben?
We were being
closely watched.
He left first,
to lead Davy Crockett
out of the way.
You have
done your work well.
Tomorrow you will
ride with us
as an Indian princess.
Now go and get some rest.
The white men have chosen
to face battle with us
at South Pass.
That means
we will need the warriors
from all the villages.
The fort at Great Plains
will first be surrounded
and cut off.
Then at South Pass,
We must have enough warriors
to attack from three sides.
Tie him up.
If you were not
fighting on the side
of the white men,
I could make
good use of you.
You'll need all your breath
to tell these Kiowas
what a great man you are.
You'll die
in tomorrow's sun.
When the wet rawhide
shrinks and cuts
into your flesh,
Perhaps you'll regret
those words.
You are not weakening,
Princess?
This is just one of
the little Kiowa games.
Is it so wrong
that I have taken
the side of the Indians
Against the whites?
You've taken the side
of a man
Who would bring destruction
upon these tribes,
Through his own desire
for power and glory.
My father fights only
for the good of all Indians.
Even when he called you
a princess, he was
thinking only of himself.
A new Indian emperor,
a second Pontiac.
That comes strangely
From a man whose
own people were massacred
by the whites.
My people were destroyed
by Comanches.
Bad Indians,
like these Kiowas.
This false cause
that your father is leading
Will bring more destruction
upon the tribes
Than all the white settlers
and soldiers combined.
I ought to step on you
like a wood tick.
But I reckon
I'll leave that to the Army.
Come on, get goin'.
We got a long
walk ahead of us.
Come on!
Come on!
Do you think this brave
understands any English?
It isn't likely.
If you could get
one hand free
And trick him into
coming within your reach,
I can do the rest.
HAWK: The thong is
loosening now.
When will I know
when you're ready?
You will hear me
ask him for water.
Many thanks.
You make an excellent
spy, but a very bad
Kiowa princess.
Perhaps I can teach them
more pleasant games
than torturing prisoners.
You mean to stay?
This is where I belong,
with my father.
Then we're still enemies.
My orders were
to bring you in.
I'm afraid I make
as bad a soldier
as you do a Kiowa.
It seems we both
put our hearts
above our duty.
Here,
go while you have
the chance.
What beats me is how
I let her pull the wool
over my eyes like that.
You're not alone.
Wait till Colonel Pollard
hears about his confidential
Indian agent, James Eagle.
I wish I knew
whether or not
She got the information
to her father.
Well, we should find out
something more about that
right now.
Hello, Hawk.
I've just come
from Eagle's camp.
The girl is there.
She told him, of course,
which pass we're taking?
Yes, sir.
She reached
her father's camp
Before I could overtake her
and the Kiowa guide.
Eagle has summoned
all the tribes for battle.
How do we know
this Injun didn't
let her go on purpose?
Why don't you
get back to your wagon,
Before I forget
I'm littler than you?
Looks like
we're heading into
plenty of trouble, Captain.
Yeah,
but one thing is certain.
We've got to go on.
My orders are
to reinforce Great Plains.
Well, we don't
have to worry much
until we reach
The fork in the trail
at Manitou.
Right.
Well, let's get moving.
Tex, hitch up.
We're moving.
Chiefs of the Kiowas,
Before calling you
to the war path,
I used my knowledge
of the white man's ways
To learn there will be
no more troops
or white wagons
Sent to this region
Until long after
next winter snows
have come and gone.
By then,
We will have all the tribes
west of the Rocky Mountains
United with us
in one great Indian nation.
An empire, free forever
From the heel
of the white invader.
Now listen
to my plan of battle.
Our first blow will fall
on the fort at Great Plains.
Sleeping Fox,
Tonight, your warriors
will surround the fort,
Tomorrow at dawn
you will attack.
Agatchee, your braves
will gather at South Pass.
When the troops
and wagon train enter,
You will ride down on them
in full force.
Arango, your men
will strike from the center.
And yours, Orano,
Will ride down on them
from the north end.
Nothing can save them now.
We'll strike such terror
in the hearts
of the white men
They'll never
come this way again.
No one shall escape us.
We'll massacre every man,
woman and child.
Let her go.
Now I am certain
of what I only suspected.
It was she
who helped Red Hawk escape.
Her heart is
with her mother's people.
Now let her die with them.
They're gathering
in force, Lieutenant.
Here's Sergeant Gordon, sir.
He has volunteered
for the detail.
You realize the urgency
of getting this message
Through to
Captain Weightman's column,
do you, Sergeant?
I do, sir.
And you understand,
that I'm not ordering you
to attempt it.
You know what happened
to the other messengers.
Yes, sir.
It's doubtful
that you'll even
reach the river.
The rocks are crawling
with Indians.
I'd still like
to try, sir.
Thanks, Gordon.
Lookee yonder, Cap.
Something's comin'.
WEIGHTMAN:
Sergeant, take her horse.
WEIGHTMAN: It isn't likely
that you came here
Just to submit to arrest,
Miss Eagle.
I've come to bring you
important information.
Very well.
Dismount, please.
Then you admit
entering my tent
And breaking into
my dispatch case?
Yes, and last night
I took more information
to my father.
In making this confession,
you realize that
I have full authority
To order you shot
as an enemy spy?
It doesn't matter.
Unless you act
on what I say,
I'll die anyway
With the rest of you
at South Pass.
I wish
we could
believe you.
I'm making no excuses.
All my life I've waited
for the day when I could
help the Indian cause.
I believed in my father.
Until I learned he wasn't
just waging a war,
but planning a massacre.
You say he means
to attack Great Plains
at dawn tomorrow?
Yes, and also they'll be
waiting at South Pass
To attack you in full force
and destroy the wagon train.
How can we believe
a word she says, Captain?
I agree with you,
Simms.
We can't put much faith
in a proven spy.
Sergeant Gordon,
with a dispatch
from Great Plains, sir.
Which way
did you come,
Sergeant?
Manitou Pass, sir.
Any sign of
hostiles there?
Not in the pass.
They've got the fort
cut off.
Other war parties
are heading for South Pass.
What the Sergeant says,
and this dispatch,
Seem to bear out
the girl's story.
Yes, sir, Captain,
it sure does.
WEIGHTMAN: Tex
TEX: Yeah.
Take the Sergeant along,
and get him a fresh horse.
Sure, Cap.
Uh, Crockett.
We've got to get
to Great Plains today.
They'll be wiped out
if they don't get supplies
and ammunition
Before the attack
in the morning.
Well, we'll have to
switch our plans and go by
the way of Manitou Pass, sir.
Well,
we've got to chance it.
I'll send word to McHale
we're coming through Manitou
And that we should
reach him tonight.
Right, sir.
Right.
Miss Eagle, it seems that
you've told us the truth.
I want you to realize
that I must hold you
under arrest
Until your case is judged
by higher authority.
Yes, Captain.
I'll be responsible
for her, sir.
Right.
Here you are,
Sergeant.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
Thank you, sir.
Chief Eagle!
I shoot soldier messenger
on trail to Great Plains.
The whites have
changed their plan.
They come by Manitou.
My daughter must have
told them
We'd be waiting
to attack at South Pass.
They're trying
to make fools of us.
Now it is they who will
ride into a death trap.
Recall your warriors
from the trails
to South Pass.
Take them
to the cliffs of Manitou.
I'll join you there.
Assemble your braves
In the hidden valley
on the east side
of Manitou,
Where you can watch
every move of the enemy.
Captain, I hate to see
the wagons enter Manitou
without scoutin' it first.
There may be an ambush.
Suppose Red Hawk and me
ride in a ways
and see what's what?
That's my job now.
Yours is here
with the wagons,
To look after
the women and children.
You goin' in
with the troops, sir?
And our supply wagons.
If you don't hear firing
in a half an hour,
Come ahead
with the wagon train.
Right, sir.
We'll be ready to roll.
Troop, forward!
Get 'em rolling!
It might be a good idea
to scout to the rear, Tex.
They've separated.
Now we can strike
a double blow.
Have your braves
join those on the cliffs
to trap the soldiers.
Get your warriors ready
to attack the wagon train
when I give the signal.
Let's try to get through.
Injuns! Injuns!
TEX: They fooled us, Davy.
They've got
their troops bottled up
in Manitou Pass.
Roll 'em.
Form a circle!
Get 'em rollin'!
So all the Indians
went to South Pass,
did they?
Hawk, stand guard over her.
If she tries to get away,
you know what to do.
No, my friend.
You'll have to get
someone else
for that duty.
I don't understand you.
I owe my life to this girl.
Her father held me prisoner.
She helped me to escape.
Then you could have
brought her in?
Yes.
Those were
your orders, Hawk.
I guess you don't need
to hear any more
than that, Crockett.
They're in this thing together
and have been right along.
I'll take your rifle.
Looks like the Army
will have a double trial.
Trial? We ought to
hang 'em both,
right now.
No, we'll leave that
to the Army.
Thomas, stand guard
over both of 'em.
Davy, wait.
You can't believe I helped
lead you into this trap?
If I believed
anything else,
I'd be a bigger fool
Than you've already
tried to make of me.
Come on, Simms.
The attack's likely to come
from that ridge.
Keep your eye on it, Simms.
Here they come.
Stay
where you are.
Jimmy, keep down!
Roll over those wagons!
Take cover!
Wet down that canvas!
We've only got one chance
to get back
to that wagon train.
Cross that river.
Doesn't look like
much of a chance, sir.
If I only knew whether
men and horses
could live in that current.
I'll find out, sir.
Come back here, you fool!
Donovan! Donovan!
Well, it looks like
we're both gonna
lose our hair.
The Captain's in
as much trouble as we are.
Neither one of us is
strong enough to fight our way
out of this alone.
If there was only some way
to get together.
Good idea,
if we could only do it.
I'm going to do it,
if I have to blast 'em out.
Come on, Tex.
Pack 'em in tight
back there.
It's a slim chance, but
it's the only one we've got.
TEX: We'll keep you covered.
Ha! Ha!
Bugler, sound the charge!
Oh, you're all right.
Sergeant,
bring in the prisoners.
Frances Oatman,
You are charged with
conspiracy and espionage
upon the United States Army.
Red Hawk,
You are charged with
gross dereliction of duty
in the face of the enemy.
Those are both
capital offenses.
Captain, you proferred
these charges.
Are they correct as stated?
Yes, sir.
Crockett, as chief scout
for this expedition,
You were in a position
to know the facts.
Are these charges true?
Yes, sir.
Before I pronounce sentence,
Have you any details to offer
bearing upon the case?
Details?
Yes, sir.
Take the young lady's case,
for instance.
We found Captain Weightman's
dispatches on the body
of Chief Eagle.
So, at least we know
she wasn't lying to us
When she tried to save us
from ambush.
Well, uh, are you defending
or accusing these prisoners?
Oh, neither, sir.
Just presenting details,
like you asked for.
Now, in Red Hawk's case,
well, if he hadn't ridden out
To help me
get that powder wagon
through them Kiowas,
None of us
would be here today.
Well, are you suggesting
that we let these prisoners
go free?
Oh, no, sir.
I'd hold them prisoner.
They ought to pay
for what they did.
Well, uh,
What are your recommendations
as to sentence?
I'd... I'd hold 'em
Until we can
scare up a preacher
to make them man and wife.
And furthermore,
under military auspices,
You will start
the first Indian school
in this district,
With the hope that you both
may help to bring about
A better understanding
between the Indians
and the whites.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you, Davy.
Good luck.
