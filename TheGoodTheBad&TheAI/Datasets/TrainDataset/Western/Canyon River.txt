There he is...
First to give up.
I never thought
he'd sell out.
I suppose he's going to
deposit all the money
He got for the herd.
How's the cattle business?
No sense sitting
around here all day
Chawin' like a bunch
of old women.
Anybody has a right
to sell out if he wants to.
I suppose Steve
wanted to get his
Before the price
dropped to nothing.
And he was going to be
the cattle king of Wyoming.
Well, the rest of you will
soon do just what he's done.
We're not selling out.
You just stick around
and see.
Sure, I'll stick around.
I got nothing better to do.
As a matter of fact,
I'll be here long after
you two-bit ranchers
Are all starved out.
If I were 20 years younger...
You won't live
to be 20 seconds older
If you keep running off
at the mouth that way!
Go ahead, let's see
how fast you are.
All right, graycoe.
That's enough.
Says who?
I've been wanting to talk
to you men about something.
Aw, we got nothing
to talk to you about.
Thanks, Steve,
for what you just did for me.
I didn't ask for your help.
Now wait a minute,
please.
Look, I just wanted
to tell you this.
If you can help it,
don't sell out.
You sold.
Now, look,
if you trust me,
You'll hold on
as long as possible.
How long are you
talking about?
Till next spring.
You can manage that
all right, can't you?
What is your scheme?
I can't tell you just yet.
We'll think it over.
Hi, Larry.
Hello, Steve.
Afternoon, Mr. mccullum.
Good afternoon, Steve.
Got a minute?
Of course. Sit down.
Thanks.
So you've sold
your cattle, huh?
All but a few head.
After paying off the crew,
this is all that's left of it.
$8,000. Not very much
for all those steers.
Longhorns are a drug
on the market.
I was pretty lucky
to sell them at all.
If you'd held them
a while longer,
The smaller ranchers
might have had some hope.
Now, I don't know.
Hope for what?
For the price of longhorns
to go up?
You know better than that,
Mr. mccullum.
Well, something
might have happened.
Sure, but not if somebody
doesn't make it happen.
I'd like to mortgage
my ranch.
You'd get more
if you sold it.
I want to keep it.
Oh, I see.
Well...
It's not worth very much.
always worth something.
You were just getting ready
to buy it.
How much do you need?
About $20,000.
$20,000!
You expect me to take
a mortgage for $12,000?
I can't do it.
You can cut the place up
into farms and make that much.
I'll let you have $6,000.
$8,000.
$6,000, Steve.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
Make out the papers.
What are you planning
to do with the money?
You'll find out.
Hi, Bob.
Steve.
How was the trip?
Well, about what
you would expect.
I got the going rate
for longhorns...
Half cent a pound.
I can pay
your back wages now.
Thanks for waiting.
That's all right.
Well, thanks
for everything, Steve.
I'll be seeing you.
Now hold on.
You've still got a job.
You're still my foreman,
regular foreman's wages.
You don't need me.
You just sold
almost all your cattle.
And half a cent a pound,
the few you got left
Aren't worth paying anybody
to look after.
Climb on your horse
and come with me.
Where to?
Just over the hill.
Remember him?
Mewhhh!
It's your little crossbreed.
How does he look to you?
He looks fine, Steve.
He's coming along great.
Gonna have
some good steaks on him.
Yeah, he's tough, too.
He's as tough as any steer
we've ever grown around here.
It's going to work, Bob.
I'm sure of it.
Looks like you're right,
Steve.
It's going to take
a lot of money.
Did you consider that?
Yeah.
I mortgaged the ranch.
I'm leaving for Oregon
tomorrow morning.
I sure wish
you'd come along, Bob.
You don't waste much time.
I can't afford to.
I'm ready.
Good.
We'll button down the place
and we'll get packed.
Mewhhh!
Where are you going?
I'm going to see Maddox.
Maybe he's busy.
He won't be too busy
to talk to me.
If it's about a job, Andrews,
I'm the man to see.
It's about a job,
But you'll probably
be working for me.
Oh? Sounds interesting.
Hmm. It is.
What is it?
I want to talk
to you, Maddox.
This is Bob Andrews.
Come in.
I have a proposition
for you, Maddox,
But it's confidential.
Mr. graycoe is
a trusted associate.
All right, Mr. Andrews.
I'm a busy man.
What is your proposition?
This is big, Maddox,
Bigger than anything
you've ever done.
And I'm going to be
your partner.
Yeah? Go on.
Steve Patrick has an idea
he thinks is going to make him
The biggest cattleman
in Wyoming.
I can't see any advantage
In being any kind
of a cattleman in Wyoming.
He's bringing in a herd
of white-face.
He's crazy.
If you don't shut up...
Who do you think
you're talking to?
Graycoe!
Mr. Andrews, graycoe's
a very impulsive man.
I suggest you be
more careful with him.
Sit down
and please go on.
Patrick has an idea
for a new crossbreed.
He's tried it and it works.
I've seen it.
It's a cross
between the Texas longhorn
And hereford dairy cattle.
It's got half again
as much meat as the longhorn
And it's just as rugged.
These winters won't
bother it at all.
It'll change the whole
cattle picture in this state.
And how does Patrick expect
to keep this a secret?
He doesn't.
Once he gets started,
He plans to furnish
his neighbors
With all the breeding stock
they need.
Very charitable man.
Just what do you expect us
to do about all this?
Some of the ranchers
around here have quit already
And their land's for sale.
The rest of them
have mortgages.
You have enough cash on hand
To buy up 10 or 15,000 acres
of land and paper tomorrow.
Then we'll go ahead.
We? I see you're
a partner already.
Not a very good
businessman.
You've told me a secret.
You've told me
how to capitalize on it.
Now if I should decide
to go ahead,
I don't need you.
Yes, you do.
You need the hereford cattle,
and I'll have them...
$14,000 worth
of the best breeding stock.
Where do you expect
to get them?
Oregon.
Patrick and I are leaving
in the morning.
I see. You figure
to grab Patrick's herd.
That's right.
And I know just the place
to do it.
I know this country
like the palm of my hand.
Mr. Andrews...
You've got a deal.
Now just tell me
when and where.
Can you furnish
about six good men?
Yes.
We'll be gone
a couple of months.
You set up a camp
above canyon river.
I'll meet you there
when we get back.
Let's see, you better be there
in about six weeks
In case we make better time
than we expect to.
I'll tell you the rest
of the plan then.
We'll be there.
In the meantime,
you buy up the land.
Maddox, between us,
We'll have the biggest spread
in this state.
Before we're through,
we'll own 50,000 head of cattle.
I'm curious
about one thing.
I thought you and Steve Patrick
were close friends.
I'm through
working for other people.
I want a ranch of my own...
A big one.
Well, if this works out...
It will,
if you do your part.
Don't worry
about that.
I've got a question, too,
Andrews.
Just what do you figure
on doing with Patrick?
You don't think he's
going to sit there
While you steal
his cows, do you?
We'll decide that
when we come to it.
All right.
We'll meet you
above canyon river.
Right.
So we're going into
the cattle business now, huh?
I don't see why not.
Maybe Patrick's all wrong
about this crossbreed.
I don't think so.
He knows more about cattle
than anybody around here.
If he says it'll work,
it will.
And you're going
to take the gamble
And sink all that cash
in land?
It won't be
much of a gamble.
The land that's available
around here is pretty cheap.
And after Patrick leaves,
it'll be cheaper.
Tell me, in your wide circle
of acquaintances,
Would there be any rustlers?
Some of my best friends.
Get me a body
of good ones, will you?
More coffee, Bob?
No, thanks.
Enough for morning.
I'll take
first shift tonight.
All right.
Wake me up
about midnight, huh?
Yeah.
If you get tired,
wake me up before that.
Neigh!
Neigh!
Steve!
Easy, Bob, easy.
It's only me, boy.
How is it?
It's not good.
Did you find the horses?
No. There must have been
quite a few of them.
I saw a lot
of moccasin tracks
Around where they
picked them up.
Sorry, Steve.
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.
Forget it.
How about a little water?
Our problem right now is
to get a doctor for you.
There's no horses.
You can't walk.
I can try.
We can't be more
than a few Miles
From the Oregon border.
Bound to be some settlers
around there.
Look, you take it easy.
I'll get back
as soon as I can.
All right.
Neigh!
Hey!
Hey!
Thanks.
All right.
What's the trouble?
Indians.
Stole our horses last night,
Shot my partner up
pretty bad.
Got to get a doctor to him
before he bleeds to death.
There aren't any Indians
within Miles of here.
I'm glad to hear that.
Where did it happen?
Rock flats
out east of here.
How did you get this far
since last night?
Walked.
That's impossible.
All right,
so it's impossible.
Are you going to get me
some help or aren't you?
I'm sorry.
I'll get a doctor
and a buckboard right away.
Thanks.
Get me a horse,
will you, please?
I'll be right here.
Oh, thanks, Chuck.
You're welcome,
Mr. Patrick.
You can call me Steve,
you know, Chuck.
Everybody else does.
Okay.
Mmm. Where'd you learn to make
pie like this, miss hale?
Back home.
I'm a farm girl from Illinois.
During the harvest season,
Mother and I used to cook
for 40, 50 people at a time.
How is he, doctor?
Oh, he'll be all right.
Bullet missed his lung
and went through.
He's got a couple
of cracked ribs
And he's lost
considerable blood,
But a couple weeks rest
will put him back on his feet.
Where's the lung, doc?
It's right there.
Boy, you killed
that Indian,
Didn't you, Steve?
Time for you
to go to bed, Charles.
You promised not
to call me that, mom.
That's right.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
Now say good night
and go to bed.
Good night, doc.
Good night,
young fellow.
Good night, Steve.
Good night, Chuck.
You know what I'm going
to be when I grow up?
I can guess.
What?
A cowboy,
that's what.
This is probably
the most exciting thing
That's ever happened
to him.
He's a fine boy.
Can I get you
some coffee, doctor?
No, thanks. I have
a couple more calls to make.
I'll stop in in a day or two
and change his dressing.
Thank you, doctor.
What do I owe you?
Oh, I don't know.
It depends on how many calls
I have to make.
I'll collect from you later.
Good night, Janet.
Good night, doctor.
Mr. Patrick...
You may not realize it,
but...
You saved
that young man's life.
I'm glad I was able
to help, doctor.
Good night.
Night.
How are your feet?
Much better, thanks.
I've done enough walking
to last me a long time.
Sure glad a cowboy can do most
of his work sitting down.
Shall I heat that up
for you?
No, that'll be fine.
Thanks.
You've been very good
to us, miss hale.
You had as much to do
with saving Bob's life
As any of us did.
Well, I'm glad I was around
at the right time.
I'm sorry to impose on you,
But if Bob has to rest up,
Mrs. hale...
He's welcome to stay here.
I'll sleep in Chuck's room.
You and the boy alone?
Yes, my husband died
almost a year ago.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's a pretty rough country
For a woman and a child
to live in alone.
Well, I'm trying
to sell this place.
As soon as I do,
I'll use the money for our
transportation back east.
I want Chuck to have
a proper education.
He's getting to be
as wild as the country.
Oh, he isn't so wild, ma'am.
No more so than any
other healthy youngster.
Maybe not.
I wouldn't be so concerned
If he had a father
to educate him.
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mrs. hale,
Unless all the men
in Oregon are blind,
There must be quite a few
who'd like to be Chuck's father.
None that I'd care
to marry, Mr. Patrick.
You must be...
Very particular.
Yes, I am.
Very.
I'm afraid you'll
have to sleep in the barn.
There's no other place
I can offer you.
That'll be fine.
Thanks again.
Good night.
Good night.
How are your feet today,
Mr. Patrick?
A bit tender, but I reckon
they'll be all right
By the time
I reach Pendleton.
I made you some sandwiches
for your lunch.
Thanks.
Thanks for the loan
of the horse, too.
Hey, Steve!
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye to me.
Now you know better
than that, cowboy.
So long.
So long.
I'll see you
in about two weeks.
All right.
Don't worry
about Mr. Andrews.
I'll take good care
of him.
Good. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Steve.
Steve don't have any boys
of his own, you know, mom.
Doesn't have any boys,
dear.
Yeah. He'd like
to have a boy, you know.
He told me so.
Oh, he did, did he?
Mom, why don't we go
on the trail drive
With Steve and Bob
when they go back to Wyoming?
It'd be a lot of fun.
I'm sure it would,
but it's much too far
For a couple of tenderfeet
like us.
Besides, we can't ride
well enough anyway.
We could learn, I bet.
Steve wasn't any older
than me when he learned.
We got plenty
to keep us busy
Around here
for a while, Chuck...
Till we sell this place.
Nobody wants to buy it.
Well,
they certainly won't
If we let it get
in any worse shape
Than it is already.
You didn't finish hoeing
the vegetable garden yesterday,
For instance, now did you?
No, ma'am.
Yes, sir, Mr. Patrick,
they're all prime beef.
You won't find better herefords
than them anywhere.
Glad to hear that.
What's your price
if I take the whole thousand?
$15 a head.
That would include
I'd let them go along
with their mothers.
This is all there is,
Mr. Reed.
I need the whole thousand head.
Hey, $14,000.
All cash.
Mister, you got a deal.
You have pretty
good-looking cows, all right.
Course they won't be
by the time I get 'em up home.
Where's that?
Powder river country...
Wyoming.
Wyoming? Mr. Patrick...
Selling a thousand head
of cattle
Is something that I just
can't do every day.
Much as I want
to make the deal,
There's something
I got to tell you.
Them herefords just won't live
on the open range.
Only Texas cattle's
got a chance
Against them hard
Wyoming winters.
They'll live.
I'll see to it,
If I have to hand-feed
every one of them myself.
All right, but I hope
you're not making
An expensive mistake.
I hope the same, Mr. Reed.
When will you have
the bill of sale ready?
Tomorrow before noon
be all right?
Fine. I'll be back either
in the morning or afternoon.
It depends on how long
it'll take me
To hire a trail crew.
Now you might just have
a little trouble there.
That's a long, hard drive
you got in mind,
Going the wrong way
on the Oregon trail.
Where do you think
I should start looking?
Might try the cattlemen's
association in town.
All right, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Be looking for you
tomorrow then.
Good luck.
I'm afraid
that's the story, Patrick.
No punchers have registered
with us for some time.
I guess they're all working.
Roundups have been over
for two months.
What happened to the men
who worked them?
I wouldn't know.
I think you would know.
When I told you
what I wanted the men for,
You didn't even check
your listings.
Listen, Patrick...
You listen!
Men who are looking for work
Aren't going to like
the way you represent them.
They'll thank me.
No cowboy in his right mind
Wants any part of a job
like yours this time of year.
So good day, sir.
Whiskey?
Yeah.
My name is Steve Patrick.
I'm a cattle rancher.
I'm looking for a trail crew.
Have any idea
where I might find one?
This is as good a place
as any, mister.
Take your pick. A
I got a crew of eight good men
and a cook, Mr. Patrick.
Experienced?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You're hired.
I pay regular wages...
$40 a month and grub,
Bonus of $20 a man if we lose
less than 5% of the cows.
How many cows
and where are you taking them?
Does that make
any difference?
No, just curious,
Mr. Patrick.
A thousand head of white-face.
I'm taking them to Wyoming.
You mean that?
Sure I mean it.
No, thanks.
You men can't want work
very bad.
We don't, Mr. Patrick.
This is the off-season.
We can get along
without a trip to Wyoming.
I've been there in the winter
and I don't like it.
Neither will your cows.
Any other saloons in town?
There's only
one other place
Where you might
pick up a crew,
But I wouldn't
recommend it.
Where's that?
It's around the corner.
It's called mcclary's.
Why wouldn't you
recommend it?
If you were looking for
owl hoots
Or ex-convicts
or rustlers,
Mcclary's would be
the place to find them.
No rancher with any sense
would hire them for punchers.
If you're going
to mcclary's, mister,
You'd better figure on
shooting your way out.
I'm taking three.
Raise.
I'll see you...
See the raise...
And bump you 50.
I'll see you,
lynch.
I'm light.
You're always light.
A house full of 3's.
That makes 30 you owe me.
Put it in the book, Ben.
How much does he owe me
altogether?
Well, let me see now.
That makes it $170...
$178,000 and 50 cents.
Nothin'.
I can afford it.
Whiskey.
You know him, Ben?
Never laid eyes
on him before.
Mister,
you're either the law
Or you're
running away from it.
Which is it?
And the answer
had better be right.
Neither one.
I'm a cattle rancher...
Looking for a trail crew.
Now that's not
very clever.
This is the last place
Anybody would look for
cowpunchers.
Yeah, it's the last place,
all right.
Nobody else wanted the job
I'm offering.
We make our own jobs.
We do all right
without hiring out to anybody.
Yeah, you look it.
Nice clothes...
A good livin'...
Lots of money
to play around with.
Yeah, you look like
you're doing real fine.
You came in here
looking for trouble,
Didn't you?
Well, you came
to the right place.
Make your play, big man.
I've had a bad day.
I reckon it's
a good a place as any
To get it off my chest.
Stand still, will ya?
I'm gonna keep
gettin' up,
So you better
get your gun.
'Cause you're gonna
have to kill me
To keep me down.
I don't want to kill you.
I want to hire you.
Want to talk business?
Talk.
Like I said,
I'm a rancher.
I'm going to Wyoming with
a thousand head of herefords.
I couldn't get
a trail crew
Because everybody thought
I was crazy to try it.
Are you interested?
Well, any man that can hit
the way you do
Can't be altogether crazy.
What's your proposition?
Regular puncher's wages...
And a permanent job
on my ranch
After we get
the herd through.
Mister,
you got a crew.
But being a stranger,
Maybe you don't
know about us.
Oh, I know about you,
all right.
You're mostly ex-convicts
or ex-outlaws.
Nobody will give you a job.
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you're my crew.
As long as you do your job
and play square with me,
That's all I ask.
I don't care who you are
or what you've done.
You're the first man
that's talked that way to us
In a long time.
You may be loco at that,
Driving cattle backwards
on the Oregon trail.
But if that's what
you want us to do,
We'll do it.
We're all
pretty good cowhands.
I believe you.
Maybe you won't think
I'm so loco
After I tell you what
I plan to do with the cows.
How about a drink?
Uh, I'd like
to go along, too.
I can cook.
You can cook?
All right.
Then you're hired.
There.
Well, you won't
need me anymore.
Thank you, Chuck.
That's fine, doc.
How soon will I be able
to ride again?
Right now,
if you want.
But don't overdo it.
Hey, let me do that.
Doc says I'm going
to live again.
Oh, he does?
He's healed up
very nicely, Janet,
Thanks to your care
and good cooking.
He doesn't owe it
all to me, doctor.
Steve Patrick helped him.
So did you.
Well, you're right
about Patrick.
There's no doubt
he saved Bob's life.
He must be
quite a man.
Yeah.
Yes, he is.
Well, goodbye.
See you soon.
So long, doc.
Thanks again.
Bye, sir.
You're getting to be
mighty polite all of a sudden.
How come?
Cowboys are always polite.
Oh.
Good day.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
There's nothing wrong
between you and Steve,
Is there?
Well, of course not.
What makes you ask?
I don't know.
Just the expression you had
When the doctor said
you owed your life to him.
You didn't seem
to like the idea.
Don't be silly.
You know,
I got a good mind
To go out
and get myself shot up again
Just so you can
take care of me.
I enjoyed it.
About your recovery.
None at all.
Too soon?
I think so.
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be.
I'm very flattered.
Janet...
Steve's going
to be here soon.
I don't want
to go back with him.
Why not?
Well, for several reasons,
but i...
I like it here.
I like it very much.
I want to start a new life...
With you.
I'm sure that if you
explain to Steve
That you want to
stay on here in Oregon,
He'll understand.
But as far
as I'm concerned...
Janet...
I'm in love with you.
I don't think you are, Bob.
You're just grateful.
Yes. Yes, I am grateful,
But I'm not proposing to you
out of gratitude.
I...I need you.
Something's troubling you,
isn't it?
Everybody's got something
troubling them, Janet.
Listen to me, please.
No. I'm sorry, Bob.
I like you very much.
That's all.
Well...
I guess that's that.
Steve!
Hey, Steve!
How you doing,
old-timer?
How you been, huh?
Fine.
That's good, cowboy.
There you are.
Good boy.
Hiya, Steve.
Hi, Bob.
Janet, how are you?
Hey, you look
as good as new.
Better maybe, huh?
How do you feel?
I feel fine.
How'd it go?
Pretty well.
I got a thousand head of
the greatest-looking white-face
You've ever seen.
Janet, I hope this character
Didn't give you
too much trouble.
No trouble at all.
He was a model patient.
Where are all the cowboys?
They're at the corral,
Chuck, with the herd.
Do they all have guns
and buckin' broncos?
Can I see them?
No, I'm afraid not.
Not this trip.
Did you get
a good crew?
Yeah, I think so.
They're a strange bunch,
But I think
they'll work out all right.
That is,
except for the cook.
He's a little bartender.
I don't think he knows
one end of the pot from another.
Can I talk to you a minute
before you go?
Sure, miss hale.
Hey, can you
ride all right, Bob?
Yeah, fine.
I'm ready whenever you are.
Good.
I know just
how you feel, Chuck.
Bob sure looks fine, Janet.
I want to thank you
for taking care of him.
He wasn't any trouble.
I'm glad to hear that.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I'd like to
pay you, Janet.
How much do I owe you?
You don't owe me anything,
Because I want
to ask a favor of you.
A favor?
Yes. A big favor.
Well, I owe you
a pretty big favor.
Take Chuck and me with you
on the trail drive.
What?
We've got to
get away from here.
I've told you why.
I can't wait until
I sell this place.
That might never happen.
And I wouldn't be
a burden to you either.
I'd be a working member
of your crew.
Janet, i...
You said you weren't sure
of your cook.
That's right.
Well, I can cook.
You're sure of that.
Yeah.
And I'd expect
to be paid for my work.
Then I'd have enough money
to get to a big city,
Like Chicago or...
Janet, I'm sorry.
I just can't do it.
Why?
Well...
There are two things
that just aren't allowed
On cattle drives...
Women and whiskey.
I don't know.
It's just...
Traditional.
A lot of things
are traditional.
For instance,
Going east to west
on the Oregon trail.
Well...
Now what about Chuck?
The trip is
much too dangerous
For a child.
He can ride with me
in the wagon.
What do you call it?
A Chuck wagon.
There. You see?
It's even named for him.
You said you owed me
a favor, Steve.
Janet...
This is the favor
I want.
I'd help, too.
I'd work hard, too, Steve.
I'd wash dishes.
All right.
You're both hired.
Oh, Steve!
Come on, Chuck.
Let's finish packing.
Hyah! Hyah!
Hup! Ho ho!
There's a stream
about an hour ahead of us.
We'll make camp
there tonight.
Okay, Steve.
I'll tell the boys.
Fine.
How you doing,
cowboy?
Great.
There's a little stream
About a mile and a half
up the line.
We'll make camp
there tonight.
Janet: All right.
Have you got a bandanna
or neckerchief?
Yes. Why?
Put it over
your nose and mouth.
It'll help
keep out the dust.
You, too, cowboy.
Well, I'll be a dirt...
That is to say,
well, I'll be doggoned.
Would you take a look
at those?
Hot apple pie!
Get in line.
The smartest thing
the boss ever did
Was to hire you to cook
instead of me.
I sure never expected
nothing like this.
Oh, me neither.
Sure looks good.
Right there,
miss Janet.
Come on, George.
Come on.
Come on!
Move along!
It's hot, boys!
Look out!
I'm next.
Right there.
Right there.
Right there.
Ha ha!
There you go.
Hot!
Ohh.
Thank you, lady.
You're welcome.
How about me?
Oh, goodness.
I was going
to forget you.
Here you are, Bob.
Thank you, Janet.
Lucky thing for Bob
that you came along.
He's gotten
so used to your cooking,
He'd probably
starve to death
If he had to eat
any other kind.
We're all going to be spoiled
before this drive's over.
This could be serious.
Well, now I never
thought of that.
You're right, Ben.
Maybe I better
stop making pies.
Janet, don't you
pay any attention
To this half-pint.
You just keep
cooking like this,
And we'll drive them cows
All the way
to the Atlantic ocean.
Wyoming is far enough.
Chuck, come on
get your pie.
Well, he's gonna be
a good little cowboy, ma'am.
Just ride
and eat and sleep.
That's one sure way of
keeping out of trouble.
Thank you, George.
Uh, he ain't going
to eat his pie.
Can I have it,
miss Janet?
There you are, George.
Thank you.
Well, now,
What about those traditions
of the trail you spoke of?
Well, i...
I could tell you stories
about the terrible trouble
Woman have caused
on trail drives,
But I reckon
we can all bear up
Under this kind of trouble.
But it's only just fair,
you know.
Maybe you can
do better tomorrow, huh?
Hey, Steve.
What's the matter with you?
Where'd you ever
eat better grub, boss?
No place.
I was just testing Janet
To see if she had
a sense of humor.
You know,
a trail cook has to have
A better sense of humor
than anybody else.
Yes, sir.
Besides
a sense of humor,
The cook also
has an appetite.
That's mine.
Thank you.
It's a pleasure.
Where are you going?
To ride nighthawk.
I'm a little more
used to the saddle
Then the rest
of the crew is.
I'll take
the nighthawk job, Steve.
You've only been up
a few days, Bob.
I'm all right.
Why don't you
get all healed up first?
There will be
plenty of other nights.
Quit nursemaiding me,
will ya?
I tell you,
I'm all right.
What's the matter with him?
He's been inactive too long.
I think he just wants to feel
he's doing his share.
Good night.
Good night.
I'll take over
for a spell.
Run up to the wagon
And get yourself
some water.
Thanks, Steve.
I must've swallowed
a pound a dirt today.
This cattle driving's more work
than I remember it.
Nobody said
it would be a picnic
When you hired on.
I'm just doing
some normal complaining
Any cowhand's entitled to.
What's the matter
with you lately?
We'll get your cattle through.
Don't worry about it.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
How you making it?
All right.
Listen, Steve.
I've been wanting to
talk to you about the crew.
Oh? What about them?
Why didn't you tell me
They're all a bunch of
gunslingers and outlaws?
I didn't think it made
any difference to you.
It doesn't to me,
as long as they do their job.
How'd you find out, anyway?
They don't make
any secret of it.
I heard 'em
talking about it.
Listen, I don't trust 'em.
Suppose you got into
some kind of trouble?
Indians or rustlers.
If anything
like that happened,
There's no one I'd rather
have on my side
Than lynch and his men.
Sure they're gunmen,
But that's the kind of men
you need in emergencies.
If they stick by you.
They'll stick.
They're good men.
Now you just
forget about the fact
That they might've
once been outlaws.
They're all right.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
There's a good campsite
up about a mile ahead, Steve...
Plenty of trees
and protection from the wind.
There's still about
two hours of daylight left.
It wouldn't hurt
to quit early.
Boys would appreciate it.
They could use the rest.
Days are getting
short enough as it is.
You tell the men we work
from dawn till dark.
Rest at night,
not before.
You're the boss.
Thanks, mom.
You're welcome.
Here's some milk for you,
young fella.
Thank you, George.
The old girl I took it from
objected a little,
But we managed.
I'll fill a plate for you.
Thanks.
Anybody want any more?
There's plenty left.
Not me, miss Janet.
A man can eat
just so much potatoes
Without any meat,
and then he gets fed up.
We are getting
low on food, Steve.
You know that.
Yeah, I know it.
Got any ideas?
Just one...
Butcher another cow,
Like they do
on any cattle drive.
This cattle drive
is a little different
From any other one.
You all know that.
I told you what
I plan to do with the cows
When I get them to Wyoming.
Now, we've lost
quite a few head
Because of the rough going.
That's why I'm not going
to kill any more for food.
We need every head
that can make it.
I'll probably
lose a lot more
Before I get
that new strain bred.
Sorry, but...
That's the way
it's got to be.
All right, boys.
You heard it.
Now do a little less complaining
and more work,
And we'll get where we're going
much faster.
Kincaid,
you've got nighthawk tonight.
Got a half an hour to finish up
and get out there.
I don't feel so good,
lynch.
Let somebody else
do it tonight.
Somebody else
will do it tomorrow.
You've got it.
Take it.
I'll take
nighthawk tonight.
You're not due
for three days.
I said I'd do it.
Good night, Steve.
Night.
Sleep well.
Thank you, Steve.
Ooh, it's getting colder.
Yeah, and it's not going
to get any warmer.
I only hope
we don't get a snow.
How much longer
do you think it'll be, Steve?
Oh, about a week
if our luck holds out.
I'll be glad
when it's finished.
Me, too.
But I wouldn't have
missed it.
You're quite a girl, Janet.
It's been
a pretty rough trip.
That's the second time
you've called me a girl.
You liked it
the first time.
Well, not anymore.
Oh, why not?
I'm afraid
you mean just that.
Why shouldn't I mean it?
I'd rather you thought of me
as a woman.
Janet, i...
I never had to ask a man
to kiss me before.
I guess I've wanted
to do that for...
For a long time.
I don't believe it.
If you'd wanted to,
you would've done it.
I love you, Janet.
Oh, I hope you do.
Otherwise I'm making
an awful fool of myself.
You are kind of bold at that.
And you're
kind of backward.
No wonder
you're still a bachelor.
Oh, it's good to hear you
laugh again, Steve.
I don't know why I am.
I'm only adding
one more trouble
To all my others.
Oh...
There are a couple answers
I'd like, Janet...
If you don't mind.
Very well.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Want to marry me and move to
that dirty old cattle ranch?
Oh, yes.
What about Chicago?
I never heard of it.
Hold it right there.
I want to see Maddox.
Who are you?
Andrews.
Okay.
Someone's coming
into the canyon.
All right, boys.
This is the man
we've been waiting for.
How are you, Andrews?
Right on time.
Come on in.
All right.
Just so we're sure
we got everything straight,
Let's go over it again.
Here's where we are now,
And here's the herd
coming this way.
We should be about here
by tomorrow night.
I see.
We stampede the herd.
That's right.
I'll be out here
on the far side
To turn the point
into the canyon.
Then we do the rest.
If Patrick and his men
follow the cattle,
We'll be up in the rocks.
And it'll make it
a real shooting gallery.
It better.
Patrick's got
a crew of gunslingers
That he picked up
in Oregon.
Looks like
you've made up your mind
We can't do this
without killing Patrick.
That's right.
Now you're getting smart.
Did you buy up the land
and mortgages like I told you?
We've got all the land
we could possibly use.
Good.
Tell me something.
Does Patrick
know about this canyon?
Sure he does.
What better place to
turn a stampeding herd?
He'll think
I'm doing him a favor
By starting him
in there.
Yeah. Good plan.
Keep the cows bottled up here
in the canyon for a while,
Put our brand on them,
Drive them onto our own land
in a few days.
You sure you can get that
nighthawk job in tomorrow?
Don't you
worry about that.
The time to
start the stampede
Is about midnight
or 1:00 in the morning
When everybody's
sure to be asleep.
Graycoe, you ride out
and meet me.
Okay.
You're the boss.
Now there's just
one more thing.
We've got
a woman in camp.
Who is she?
She's our cook.
She's got a kid with her.
All right, Andrews.
It's your party.
What'll we do about her?
Don't do anything
about her.
I'll kill the first man
who lays a hand on her
Or that kid.
Your job to
keep her quiet afterwards.
That's right.
It's my job,
and I'll take care of it.
Everything straight now?
Yeah.
I better get back to the herd
before daylight.
Give me some coffee.
You don't look very well.
I guess I don't.
I'm sick.
Give me some coffee.
All right.
You're not sick.
You're drunk.
Shut up.
Good morning, Steve.
Good morning, cowboy.
Good morning, Janet.
Good morning, Steve.
Kincaid...
You know whiskey
is not allowed
On a trail drive.
Patrick, I-I'm a sick man.
Then get on your horse and
ride to the nearest doctor.
Lynch!
Yeah, Patrick?
Pay Kincaid off
And have Janet
fix him some grub.
Patrick!
You firin' me?
That's right.
Why, you...
You know the rules,
Kincaid.
Get your stuff together.
I'll handle him.
You're not sick,
and you know it.
You've been a cowhand
long enough to know
That nobody drinks
on a trail drive.
You're through,
Kincaid.
Sure, I've been
a cowhand a long time.
Long enough to know
that no trail boss
Ever kept his crew
from eating meat.
None of them worried more
about his fool cows
Than he did about his men!
You're crazy, Patrick.
You're drunk, Kincaid,
and you're lucky to be.
For that reason,
I'm not going
to shoot you.
Take your hand away
from that gun.
Now get going.
You sure you don't
want some grub?
No, I don't want no grub.
You know,
Steve was right, Kincaid.
You are a lucky man.
He was within his rights
to have blown your head off.
Good morning, Bob.
Morning, Janet.
Thanks.
You must be cold
clear through.
No, I kept moving.
Morning, Bob.
How'd it go last night?
Okay.
Steve...
Listen, i...
Jergenz! Ben!
Get your horses!
Never mind.
Let him go.
Thanks, Bob.
That's all right.
We're even now.
Yeah.
Steve said
to take the herd
Up as far
as the flat rocks
Just this side
of river canyon.
Said you'd know
where it was.
Yeah, I know.
What happened to Steve?
He's up scouting ahead,
Said he'd meet us
back in camp tonight.
All right.
I've been meaning to talk
to you about this morning.
That was a pretty quick piece
of thinking.
A good shot, too.
I'm sorry about Kincaid
going bad like that,
But, well,
it happens sometimes.
The whole crew's
gone a little sour.
Oh, they'll be all right,
If I have to sit on
every one of them myself.
I still can't figure out
Why you all signed on
as cowpunchers
For $40 a month.
That's $40 more
than we were making.
You don't have
to kid me, lynch.
I'm not.
Bob, let me
tell you something.
I've done a lot of things
in my life to make a living...
A little robbing,
a little rustling.
An awful lot of running.
Yes, sometimes we made
more than $40 a month,
But I haven't felt this good
since I was a kid.
I feel good.
Maybe you won't
when you get into town
And try to do anything
with that money.
$40 doesn't go very far.
Far enough.
Steve's promised us jobs
on the ranch.
I'd work for that man
for nothing.
You know, I feel
I'm pretty lucky,
Having met up with Steve.
But you're
even luckier, Bob.
Why?
How do you figure?
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.
If you're smart,
you'll stick with Steve.
He's going to be
a big cattleman some day,
And you'll grow
right along with him.
He likes you...
As much as if you were
his own brother.
Sure.
Steve's all right.
I don't know
what's bothering you,
But whatever it is,
I hope you get over it...
Quick.
Yah!
Let's go! Whoa!
Whoa! Go!
Pay attention to what
you're doing, Chuck.
You're wasting
a lot of potato.
Nobody wants 'em, anyhow.
Don't talk like that.
You heard what Steve said
about the cattle.
Mom, where is Steve?
I don't know.
Man: No, George.
I tell you,
this time you're wrong.
We made a mistake.
We might as well admit it.
Lynch: It's not going
to be much longer.
In less than a week,
we'll have meat.
I don't believe that.
Neither do the other hands.
No, we're quitting.
All of us!
Might as well quit arguing.
We're through!
Look, we know you're
on his side.
That's why we want
to quit right now,
Just kind of calm-like,
Before we get
in any shootin' scrapes
With you or Patrick
or maybe Andrews.
You're a fine bunch
of punchers.
Because you haven't
had meat for a few days,
You're ready to give up!
Kincaid was wrong to be
drinking on the trail...
All right, all right.
But he did
make some sense.
He sure did.
And another thing...
We're gonna butcher a cow
and eat it before we leave.
Any trail boss who won't
feed his men proper
Can get hisself
another crew.
We're giving notice
right now.
Hey, mom, look!
Janet, you reckon
you still remember
How to broil
venison steak?
I can try, Steve,
But it's
a pretty small deer.
Couldn't be more than
He was just a baby...
Only a 6-pointer.
Probably wouldn't dress out
more than 150 pounds.
Do the best you can,
though, huh?
Did you hear
what she said?
I ain't had venison steak
for 10 years.
I don't know if I can wait
till it's cooked!
What was it you were saying
Before we were interrupted
by that piece of meat
Walking right in the camp?
Why, uh, you remember
very well, Mr. lynch.
We were saying
as how we're ashamed
To be eating with you
any longer.
We think it's time you
washed your dirty face!
George,
you let me go, now!
There, that'll teach you,
you little runt!
Now you either apologize
Or you eat dinner
in your underwear!
That's the first time
they've laughed
In a long time,
Steve.
Ah, it sounds good.
George!
George, you give me back
my pants!
Give me my pants, George!
George, I'm pulling
the tree out by the roots!
George!
Well, the herd's right
where he said it would be.
Good.
It's 8:30.
We'll wait
about three hours.
By that time,
Everybody ought
to be asleep except Andrews.
You know,
when I was punching cows,
I used to hate that sound.
Don't sound so bad
to me anymore.
You'll be punching cows
again, my friend,
Only this time
they'll be ours.
Sure you've
had enough, now?
Yes, ma'am.
Good night.
Good night, cowboy.
Night.
What's the matter,
too much dinner?
Hey, you must've gained
at least 10 pounds.
Thank you.
Ohh,
mighty tasty dish.
Where'd you say
you found this buck?
Back up in the hills.
He's got more relatives
up there, too.
I think I'm going
to like Wyoming...
Mountains full of deer,
rivers full of fish and...
Coyotes.
I can do without them.
He's just talking
to the moon.
We all do in Wyoming.
I hate to work off
all that good food,
But it's my turn
to nighthawk.
I'll trade with you
tonight, Ben.
All right with you,
Steve?
Sure.
Think you can
stay awake?
Oh, I'm wide awake.
I've been having trouble
sleeping, anyway.
Do you mind, Ben?
Mind?
I should say not.
I don't figure I'll have
trouble going to sleep.
You shouldn't have
any trouble.
You ate enough for three
normal-sized cowhands!
Ha ha. Yeah... I did.
Bob.
I'm sure glad
you came along, Bob.
Yeah, me, too.
If things work out
the way I figure, Bob,
By next spring you're going
to have your own place.
What do you mean?
I'm going to start you out
with a couple hundred cows
And all the longhorns
you'll need for breeding.
Sure hate to lose
a good foreman,
But I want to see you
get started
On your own spread.
That sounds great,
Steve.
You're being
very generous.
You deserve it.
See you later.
You all set, Andrews?
Not quite.
Go get Maddox.
What for?
Is something wrong?
Yeah. Go get him.
Wait a minute.
Settle down.
What's this all about?
I want to see Maddox.
There's no time
for that now.
Get to the other side
of that herd.
Unh-unh.
The deal's off.
What?
Hoist 'em.
Look, Andrews...
I said hoist 'em
and turn around.
Why don't you cut out
this foolishness
And tell me
what's going on?
I told you.
I changed my mind.
The deal's off.
Stampede!
Bob! Stop!
Try to turn 'em
into that canyon!
No, you can't!
Sure, we can. Come on!
Steve!
Maddox is in there!
He'll kill you!
Steve: Yah!
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!
Hyah!
Something's gone wrong.
Get out there
and make sure
Those cattle head
into the canyon!
Neigh!
Hyah! Yah!
Whoo! Whoo!
We can't turn 'em.
Andrews
has double-crossed us.
He's turning them away
from the canyon.
Get him.
Get Patrick, too.
We got 'em now.
Keep 'em milling!
There he is.
Bob's hurt bad, Steve.
Bob.
Steve.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Maddox is not going
to dry-gulch anyone else.
Now easy, boy.
Steve...
I was in with them.
Don't talk anymore, Bob.
You're going
to be all right.
I'm sorry, Steve.
Janet...
I...
How do you like it?
It's beautiful.
Boy, what a place
to be a cowboy!
Ha ha ha!
There he is...
First of the new strain.
Chuck and I
want him for a pet.
Pet?
Why?
If he's the one that
brought you to Oregon,
He deserves
special treatment.
We owe him a lot.
I agree with you.
He's all yours, cowboy.
There comes our future,
Janet.
It may be the future
Of every other ranch
in Wyoming.
