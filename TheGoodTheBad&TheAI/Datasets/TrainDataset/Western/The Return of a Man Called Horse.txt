Take their
horses and young squaws.
Yellow Hands must leave
here or we kill them all.
Zenas! Zenas Morro!
Viens ici. Les sauvages...
They are coming.
- Gryce.
- Zenas.
It's all over.
Them Yellow Hands won't be
bustin' up your traps no more.
That Owl. Will he work for us?
I don't know. He did a good job this
time. Them that ain't dead's runnin'.
Chemin, tell the chief that he'll be
well rewarded for helping us out today.
Tell him that we claim
all these beaver creeks
and Yellow Hand country
by right of discovery.
Tell him we'll buy the Yellow Hand squaws
and use them around here for slaves.
But put a mark on them so we
can tell them from the Ricks.
And tell Owl him and his Ricks can live
outside the fort. We'll take care of them.
I know that Hudson Bay Company
- they'll be wantin' to move in on the territory,
so you tell this
savage son of a bitch
we'll pay him to protect our trappers
from all hostiles, red or white.
You tell him we'll pay
his Ricks with gold.
They don't
care about no gold.
Then give them some whiskey.
We leave our
blood on the sacred land.
Here we are! Here we are!

Yes.
Denham. Get me Denham.
I see you've made your decision.
Yes, Denham, I have. I'm going back.
- How soon will you be leaving?
- Soon. Right away.
- How long will you be gone?
- How long?
- One year, and no more.
- I understand.
And, Denham, look after the
place for me while I'm gone.
I hope you find what
you're looking for.
Thank you.
Shunkawakan greets
the Yellow Hand people.
A son of the
Yellow Hands has returned.
Hello there!
Could you tell me who the
proprietor of this residence is?
What the hell is that?
Could I come in, please?
Thank you.
Thank you. That's most civil of you.
- Mon dieu!
- Bonjour, monsieur. Comment ça va?
I say, could you look at
the foreleg of my horse?
Blazing hot, the sun. I brought
this for the rain, you know.
My horse?
Come on. Get up here. Hurry!
See? The woman is ours.
Absolutely not done,
old boy. Not done.
Get off of me!
Gryce! Quiet!
Are you going to waste
your time with that?
What an extraordinary beast.
I'm so glad you stopped him.
- Now, who in God's name are you?
- I am doing a survey of the West.
It appears your president -
Jackson, I believe his name is -
regards everything west of
the Missouri as worthless.
Two dollars, I believe,
is all it's worth.
- So William sent me for a
look-see. - William? William who?
The fourth, old boy.
His Majesty. Our King.
I do beg your pardon. My name is
McClory, Seventh Duke of Kildare. And you?
Morro. Zenas Morro. I run this place.
Ah. And a jolly
little fort it is, too.
You're wrong, friend. This
is a peaceful trading post.
We're friendly to all
trappers and Indians.
How could you be so naive? There is
no such thing as friendly natives.
- I must move on. My horse?
-  Nothing wrong with it.
Thank you, old boy.
Maybe you ought to
stay here for the night.
Another time, old boy, another time.
- Do you know the Hudson Bay Company?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, old boy. Quite sure.
Oh! By the by... As a matter
of historical reference,
what happened to that band of savages,
the ones that were camped nearby?
Something "Hands," they were called.
- Yellow Hands.
- Precisely.
I knew it was some
vulgar colour like that.
They moved on.
I was told that Indians never
leave their sacred burial grounds.
- Well, you were told wrong.
- Oh, good.
I did think it rather unhygienic to
reside amidst one's decaying ancestors.
You knew them, these Yellow Hands?
- Come back here!
-
Now, there's one of your Yellow
Hands. Nothing but trouble.
Open the gates!
You know, fraternising sexually
with a native is not done, old boy.
In the best of circles, that is.
Well, good luck with
your little fort.
Gryce, get your mind off that squaw.
I want you to track that
dandified son of a bitch.
He's a spy for the Hudson's
Bay Company. I swear it.
He's not alone. Find out
who's with him and how many.
Then we'll send out a scalping party.
Son of a bitch. He's alone.
Hey.
Go back, tell Zenas the
Englishman is travelling alone.
I will bring his scalp... Go!
Get out of here...
It's you.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm not making
a spot of tea, old boy.
The Yellow Hands. Where are they?
The Ricks massacred them.
- And the survivors?
- There wasn't any.
Where are the survivors?
There was a few women and kids. The
Ricks slaved them and sold some to us.
Where are they?
What the hell difference does it
make? They're gone! They're finished!
Where are they?
South... southeast! Into the
Badlands! Now cut me loose!
Come on! Cut it!
Her name was
Wi-Wacapi, by the way.
The young girl you
shot... in the back.
You been here before.
It means "Moonstar".
I knew her when she was twelve.
You'll never see any of your
Yellow Hand friends alive.
My Ricks will track you
down wherever you go.
Shunkawakan.
Shunkawakan has returned.
Come and greet Shunkawakan,
he is one of us.
Don't be afraid.
Shunkawakan is a Yellow Hand.
Chief Lame Wolf...
Remember my son, Standing Bear?
No horses... no
buffalo... we eat our dogs.
I bring gifts for everyone.
Great covering for
head of great chief.
Here. Here.
For fighting.
For hunting. For fighting.
Raven.
Morgan.
Go, friend. There is
nothing here for you. Go.
Is it not a good
omen that he returns?
No! The evil spirit watches
us... We offer the gifts to him!
Sign say Yellow Hand spirit fly away.
Lose sacred rock and
old burial ground.
Cannot go back.
Have no place.
Elk Woman, I have
brought horses, guns.
We'll hunt the buffalo again.
We'll have meat,
teepees, and a new life.
Buffalo spirit gone.
No hunt.
Heart full of pain.
Elk Woman...
to give up hope is to die.
We must wait for
sign from evil spirit.
There is no evil
spirit, only evil men.
Tomorrow, when the gifts I have
brought for the people are returned,
then the Yellow Hands will be
strong again and destroy the enemy.
You talk like white man, Shunkawakan.
Guns no good against evil spirit.
Everything is gone.
Gone.
Well, if everything is gone,
then the evil spirit is satisfied
and the Yellow Hands are free.
He wants more?
You've hidden everything,
haven't you, Raven?
You've hidden everything.
Now, where are they?
Where are they?
Where are they?
- Everybody!
-
Come up here and help me find
the guns! Help me find the guns!
Elk Woman, help me! Talk
to the people! Tell them!
I have brought horses...
we can hunt the buffalo again.
You need the Buffalo
Spirit to fight the men at the fort.
Tell them, Elk Woman! They
must fight back! They must!
Or they will die!
The people will die!
Shunkawakan, why you come back?
- You look for something?
- Oh, yes.
Look for something that I
found when I was here before...
the power of the great spirit.
I tried to take it back with me to
England, but when I got there, it left me.
And now I'm lost.
I'm lost.
So I came back.
I came back, only to find
the people as broken...
and as lost as I am.
All waiting to die.
- We wait for sign.
- For what sign?
For lightning to strike the fort?
If evil spirit go away,
Yellow Hand kill enemy.
Go back to sacred land.
Your enemies are not afraid
of the evil spirit, Elk Woman.
They've got guns, cannon, power.
If Yellow Hands all die...
that is way it will be.
You're not afraid of death?
Are you afraid to die?
You have forgot much.
Elk Woman...
Help me.
- Help me.
- You must forget yourself.
Fast four days and four nights.
Purify your body.
Seek your vision.
You must suffer for the people.
Then you will be reborn.
I send my voice to the four
corners of the universe,
to the earth and sky
and all that breathes and grows
on the land and flies above it.
In these things, your spirit lives.
Send me the vision so I may earn
the right to hold the sacred pipe...
and through it, find the way.
This is the centre of the universe.
It is a circle without
beginning and without end.
And in it you will
find your own centre...
where there is no future and no past.
The smoke from the sacred
pipe, mixed with my breath,
will rise and spread
throughout the universe,
and become one with the
breath of the great spirit,
who has now shown me the way.
Oh, Wakhán Thánka,
you see here a sacred place.
You see here a sacred
centre which we have fixed,
and in which I shall suffer.
O great spirit,
on behalf of the people,
I offer all my suffering.
Great Evil Spirit... free us!
O Thunder God...
Do not destroy the Yellow Hands.
I give my life so
the people may live!
Stop!
- My God.
- Morgan.
Morgan.
Shh, Raven, Raven...
Raven... the Yellow
Hands have suffered enough.
I understand now.
My people are free.
What you have done is sacred.
You have suffered for your people.
Now the Great Spirit is within us.
We are reborn!
Buffalo give his
spirit to our people.
So the children can play at revenge?
No. For fighting.
We're too few, Elk Woman.
We're too few.
Like brothers we share
the smoke of the sacred pipe.
All the Lakota people are happy
that our Yellow Hand brothers...
again hunt the buffalo.
Red Cloud, the Rickarees
who now live near the fort...
are strong and keep us from our land.
You should fight to the death
to keep your sacred land.
Red Cloud...
That is precisely why they're here.
They want help to
fight the white trapper.
- White men of river?
- Yes.
Our brothers.
Give us knives. Arrowhead.
Take few furs. They give us gun.
The white man has come to
strip the land and to own it.
Own land?
How can land be owned?
Can man own rock? Tree?
Bird? Mountain?
Own man's heart?
Where the sun rises and
the great rivers flow,
I have seen land and all that
grows there and lives on it
owned by the white man.
- You lie!
- No! No, white man lies!
You white man! You lie!
White man of river our brothers.
Red Cloud...
He... He has come to ask
for a few of your warriors
because the Yellow Hands
have not got enough men.
Then let your women fight!
-
-
We will do our own fighting.
How many
braves come to help us?
None!
We give you your life.
Tell your people the Yellow
Hands want to live in peace.
Now the Yellow Hands all die.
Yellow Hands are gone!
Well, it's better than nothing.
Bonjour,
Zenas.  Chemin.
Very good.
I have a present for
you, my little savage.
Look, eh? Iron. Very valuable.
I'll make you a bracelet. All right?
Come here.
All right. Good, huh?
All right.
Another one.
Like it?
Ahhh... beautiful!
You know, those
Indians. Happy slaves.
Take no
chances... wait until the attack begins.
I understand.
Well done.
Come back here. You behave yourself.
You know I love you. Come here.
Everyone to their post!
Be on the alert for attack!
You dirty squaw.
What in hell are you men doing
there? Get away from there!
Get to your posts! You, get!
Load that cannon!
Chemin!
Why didn't you sound the alarm?
Damn Yellow Hands! Where
the hell did they come from?
They're getting away! Fire!
Stay out of
the woods. It is a trap.
What's going on down there?
Those are Yellow Hand squaws.
They're sneaking up on our Ricks.
Come on, boy.
Barricade that gate!
Reload the cannon!
Get up there!
All right, get that
cannon ready to fire.
Attention! Over here! Another rider!
Oh, no. Keep this loaded and firing.
Give me a hand.
You don't fool me! You
want it all for yourself!
Damn savages.
Pagan filth!
