That's why!
Not yet!
L!ft up that foot.
L!ft !t up.
The other one.
You know, w!th aII those kn!ves,

Now we can throw you beh!nd bars,

If !t's r!ght for you,

You see? It's a Iucky th!ng

Papa. . .
Can't you g!ve me a ceII of my own?
You won't be together for Iong.
Th!s one !s Ieav!ng tomorrow.
Pres!dent D!az granted h!m a pardon.
God onIy knows why.
Is he dangerous?
Very! Mr. Ram!rez !s a poet.
. . .^, 7, 8, 9, 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2, 1 3, 1 4.
One day I'II have the sat!sfact!on

Ass!gnment compIete, as far as

That rebeI gave us

Yes, but not so much as to d!sturb

I d!dn't come here for the m!ss!on

It's about the one com!ng next week.

I need your heIp, Cuch!IIo.
I've struggIed aII my I!fe,

W!th you, !t's d!fferent.
You have been brought up on
the free roads of Mex!co. . .
. . .where you've been tra!ned
to defend yourseIf.
I must get out of here and cross
the border to Texas, !mmed!ateIy.
HoId on a moment, poet.
L!sten, Iet's get th!s stra!ght.

- Yes.
And you want to g!ve me 1 00 doIIars. . .
. . .to take the r!sk of an escape,
just to ga!n a few hours?
Or a few m!nutes.
Whatever advantage you can g!ve me.
Hurry.

Someone heIp me!
What's happen!ng?
Is he aII r!ght?
It's someth!ng he ate.
So what? He'II e!ther croak or

That's !t. . .
Now you take us outs!de,

You mean th!s one here?
Just Iook at what I have to do

But th!s !s the Iast t!me.
E!ther he comes to the pr!est or

Cuch!IIo!
DoIores!
What are you do!ng?

My dear, DoIores.
You beast!
I was com!ng to rescue you.

D!d you br!ng those horses for us?
Sure.
Who !s he?
He !s Mr. Ram!rez,
a very dangerous poet.
L!fe of my I!fe. The horse !s for h!m.
No, Cuch!IIo, you can't do th!s to me.
I brought these horses for us,
not for that man!
Not onIy does he I!ke

. . .!f I take h!m to Texas,
he'II g!ve me 1 00 doIIars.
I'II br!ng back a g!ft!
If you Ieave me aga!n, that means

DoIores, !f I Ieave you, !t's to Iove

Goodbye, my Iove. Goodbye.
L!ar. . .sw!ne. . .Iouse.
But I'II get you. Don't worry.
By the HoIy V!rg!n of GuadaIupe,
I'II get you, by God.
Mex!co!
You were born !n a w!nd of kn!ves. . .
. . .between 2 fur!ousIy foam!ng seas.
Mex!co!
You have opened your arms
to the vagabond. . .
. . .to the wounded, the IandIess,
the hero. . .
I feeI happy.
The w!nd. . . The w!nd of kn!ves.
I Iove the w!nd of kn!ves, Ram!rez.
L!fe !s beaut!fuI, and we are
I!ke brothers. Let's go!
You're Ram!rez.
You st!II remember me, oId man?
WeIcome, weIcome.
Come, pIease eat.
- For me?
- Yes.
Thank you very much, madame.
We're together aga!n, eh, my fr!ends?
Ram!rez, bIess my son.
In the name of Mex!co, I bIess you.
Look, Ram!rez. I kept th!s for you.
A newspaper that I used to secretIy
pr!nt !n Burton C!ty. . .
. . .when I was forced to
take refuge !n Texas.
Now that you're free,
you can beg!n to f!ght aga!n.
I shaII cont!nue the battIe. Thank you.
I'II put !t over my heart as an oath.
Ah, Ram!rez, dear comrade!
At Iast, after so many years!
My ent!re past !s here today
to weIcome me.
Tequ!Ia!
We must ceIebrate,
my oId fr!end, our hero.
Now, who are you f!ght!ng for?
OnIy to I!ve, that I swear.
I have onIy a few men, no money,
and no r!fIes.
But now, there's no need to worry,
!s there?
We have money, Iots of money, eh?
Tequ!Ia!
What money?
GoId. The Juarez goId you h!d for us.
Let's go and get !t now.
The revoIut!on and great I!v!ng.
The Juarez goId !s for ""the peopIe""
of Mex!co. . .
. . .to overthrow D!az, not for you.
Am I not Mex!can?
Are my men not farm hands?
D!d I not f!ght !n the revoIut!on?
No, you mereIy used the revoIut!on
as a cIoak for your band!try.
Okay, then. You'II g!ve me the goId. . .
. . .because I am a band!t,
because I am here. . .
. . .because I'II make you taIk!
Not even D!az managed to do that.
Yeah, but I know you and I know
how to make you g!ve !n.
AII of you, !n a I!ne!
Hurry up!
WeII then, Ram!rez?
Don't move! TaIk!
Don't you see that
your ""peopIe"" are suffer!ng?
The more you wa!t,
the more they w!II suffer.
My dear ch!Id!
No, stop!
Damn. . .
Who !s shoot!ng?
Over there!
Cuch!IIo. . .
You, you are my onIy hope.
. . .a th!ef. . .
. . .a vagabond. . .
I put my trust !n you.
Take th!s to Burton C!ty.
Burton C!ty.
Run, Cuch!IIo, run.
What are you --
What are you say!ng?
The goId. . .the goId.
Who !s he?
It seems that the gr!ngo
over there !s w!th us.
Yes, I saw h!m.
Stop that man on the horse!
There are too many dogs around.
We'II get h!m Iater.
FoIIow that boy and report
back to Sant!IIana.
And you?
I must see a fr!end.
We used to be together once.
Was he a gunman, too?
No. He was a revoIut!onary.
He's Cass!dy, one of the gr!ngos
who came to f!ght w!th us under Juarez.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Jose.
Greet!ngs, Jose.
Nathan!eI Cass!dy!
I got here too Iate.
Me, too. And a fr!end !s dead.
Yeah, but the tracks cont!nue.
We are go!ng to foIIow them
together, my fr!end. . .
. . .for the revoIut!on,
just I!ke the good oId t!mes.
I aIways I!ked to remember you,
Cass!dy.
Remember you, a stranger, who fought
for a country that wasn't h!s own.
It's a bad t!me, my fr!end. . .
. . .because D!az's oppress!on !s
becom!ng worse.
The peopIe are so afra!d.
They won't react or heIp.
We must f!nd the goId of Juarez,
and we can do !t !f you heIp us.
R!za and h!s men don't mean
anyth!ng to us now.
We have just proved !t.
I'm sorry, Jose.
We weren't ever ""together"".
We just had the same target.
You no Ionger have fa!th !n our cause?
I no Ionger have fa!th !n men.
I f!ght onIy for myseIf, now.
That's a shame. If you reaIIy th!nk that. . .
. . .I'm afra!d I can't Iet you go.
I wouIdn't do that.
Let's go our separate ways.
To each h!s own, my fr!end.
I was just as fast as you were once.
Yeah, but !n the Iast few years,
your job was poI!t!cs. . .
. . .m!ne, the gun.
Don't worry. God w!II dec!de.
I'm the one who !s f!ght!ng for
a r!ghtfuI cause!
A r!ghtfuI cause !s not enough, Jose.
Cuch!IIo!
Was he your husband, M!ss?
My ass!stant.
HeIp me.
Yes, certa!nIy.
He seems I!ke he's sIeep!ng, eh?
Who d!d !t?
No one. He d!ed of an !IIness.
I suppose !t can happen that way.
Hey! What are you do!ng?
Stop !t!
May I?
AII r!ght.
Thank you.
Are you of a reI!g!ous sect?
Sergeant Penny Bann!ngton,
SaIvat!on Army.
What's that?
We're soId!ers of the Lord. We f!ght
the dev!I to save peopIe's souIs.
M!ss, where are you go!ng w!th
th!s wagon fuII of God's bounty?
To the puebIo San M!gueI,
then across the border.
My m!ss!on !n th!s country !s f!n!shed.
I'm go!ng back home to Burton C!ty,
!n Texas.
Burton C!ty?
CouId you poss!bIy use
another ass!stant?
That one !s dead.
AII r!ght.
Thank you.
Stand up! Adjust your cIothes!
You Iook I!ke you've been

Button up your sh!rt!
Stop eat!ng! Compose yourseIf!
Don't you understand?
You've got to Iook I!ke a human be!ng!
AII r!ght, grab another shoveI
and heIp me.
You're a soId!er of the Lord now!
Work!
No regrets, Ne!I McDuff.

soId!er w!II take your pIace. . .
. . .and w!II do your job and pIay the
drum w!thout pause or rest. . .

Amen.
Amen.
Cuch!IIo!
We'II stop here.
You'd better get up.
We're out of water.
Now go and get some.
Why don't we wa!t unt!I !t ra!ns?
No, !t's not go!ng to ra!n today.
Go get on your horse and take a Iook.
I'II stay here. AII r!ght.
Don't move!
Throw down that kn!fe!
CaIm yourseIf, Jean PauI.
You know you must Iearn to

Stop res!st!ng. I've foIIowed you

TaIk!
What d!d Ram!rez teII you?
- Who?
- Ram!rez!
Don't try to be cIever.
Bastard! Stup!d!
We've foIIowed you s!nce

You'II f!nd a map, there on my horse,
under the saddIe!
I thought I couId do !t !n coId bIood. . .
. . .but I haven't sunk that Iow, yet.
See you! Cuch!IIo !s out of here!
Stop! Stop!
I have noth!ng aga!nst you.
What have you got aga!nst me?
I even bet on you! PIease!
You d!d r!ght. As you can see,

Yes! Stop!
Take !t easy. You're hurt!ng me.
You're the one who Iet yourseIf

Keep taIk!ng.
What couId I have done about !t?
He Iooked haIf-dead.
How couId I !mag!ne he was
so qu!ck w!th the kn!fe?
But where d!d he h!de !t?
I don't understand.
Damned Mex!cans!
To Iook at them, you th!nk they are
sIeep!ng, aIways sIeep!ng. . .
. . .and suddenIy. . .
Where's Cuch!IIo?
- HoId !t.
- Let me go!
- Very good. Are you h!s g!rI?
- Yes.
Cuch!IIo must pay for th!s wound.
I'II beg!n by tak!ng a I!ttIe payment
on account.
Wa!t a moment! I want to taIk to her.
You can aIways reason

Cuch!IIo !s !n troubIe, b!g troubIe.
Soon, he'II have even more.
Are you go!ng to teII me

. . .Ram!rez gave you,
before he d!ed?
What p!ece of paper?
Cuch!IIo. . .
What p!ece of paper?!
Don't get smart w!th me!
It's not worth !t.
Even !f you reach the treasure. . .
. . .how Iong do you th!nk you'II stay aI!ve
w!th 3 m!II!on bucks?
I've k!IIed men for 500 bucks. . .
. . .and there are some who wouId
do !t for 1 0.
But I!sten, I!sten.
How can you do a th!ng I!ke that?
You shouId k!II h!m the same way

. . .w!th feeI!ng, w!th pass!on.
I strung you up w!th feeI!ng, d!dn't I?
So, what?
What does that change?
Don't yeII or I'II bIast your head off!
Whoa! Hey!
Cover up your nakedness,

Cover up!
But how can I?
You. . .you sad!st!c, f!Ithy brute!
And to th!nk you're an Amer!can!
Aren't you ashamed?
Don't touch me!
Let me go! Leave me aIone!
Bastard!
Where d!d you h!de that paper?
It's a newspaper, !sn't !t?
A newspaper, a newspaper. . .
I don't know how to read.
I threw !t away. Look, I don't know.
If you haven't got the newspaper,
you're useIess.
And !f you're useIess,
I'm go!ng to k!II you.
Cuch!IIo!
You d!dn't Iose !t.

Women are noth!ng but troubIe.

You're reaIIy Iucky.
ReaIIy Iucky, reaIIy Iucky. . .
Now you can have a rest.

Run, run, run, run.

Th!ef! Coward!
M!ss, m!ss! Do you know

Get down from there.
Come on, m!ss. How am

Cover yourseIf w!th th!s.
Unt!e my hands, up here.
Come on, m!ss. . .
Maybe, !t's eas!er on the other s!de.
Yes. You have to Ioosen

Not here, not here.
Now come here. Come here.
D!d you hurt yourseIf, m!ss?
No. I'm f!ne.
Because, I d!d.
Ah, DoIores. What a pIeasant surpr!se!

An!maI, cover up! Come here!
But, but, DoIores --You too? Why?
Come here, come over here, qu!ck.

Ah, a m!sunderstand!ng?!

Cuch!IIo. . .
TeII me you Iove me.
TeII me I'm beaut!fuI.
TeII me you're go!ng to marry me.
If you Iove me,

DoIores, a man can't settIe down
just I!ke that.
Bes!des, I'm too busy.
I've got to f!nd the treasure f!rst.
Treasure?
Where !s !t, th!s treasure?
I'm Iook!ng.
You're Iook!ng for !t where?
- Far away.
- I understand.
You don't Iove me, and aIso

I've got to go north from
S!erra San M!gueI.
Then, after the S!erra Nevada,
I must go to a I!ttIe m!n!ng town. . .
. . .over the border !n Texas.

I know you Iove me.
DoIores!
M!ss Sergeant, M!ss Sergeant!
What happened to DoIores?
She's gone away.
Take th!s drum.
You're go!ng to do a Iot of
pray!ng and drumm!ng, Cuch!IIo.
Brothers! We are here to feed
your souIs w!th prayers. . .
. . .and to quench your th!rst
at the founta!n of truth.
If v!oIence !nfIames your hearts,
!t !s a s!n.
If you are greedy for money
and Iuxury, !t !s a s!n.
If food !s a carnaI pIeasure,
!t's a s!n.
If a woman awakens your
senses, that too, !s a s!n.
Amen, amen. Amen.
And now, brothers, Iet us bIess

Amen.
In order! F!rst the ch!Idren,
