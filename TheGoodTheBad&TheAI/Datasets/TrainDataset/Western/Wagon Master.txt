I wish you hadn't
done that, son.
Please,
please, don't shoot!
# A hundred years
have come and gone
# Since 1849
# But the ghostly wagons
rollin' west
# Are ever brought to mind
# Their rollin', rockin',
creakin' wheels
# Were heard
from shore to shore
# And always
in the hearts of men

# Rollin', rollin'
# Rollin', rollin'
# Rollin', rollin'
# Rollin', rollin'
# Wagons west are rollin'
# Out where winds are blowin'
# Cross rivers and plains
# Through sand
and through rain
# Rolls a mighty
wagon train... #
# I left my gal in West Virginny
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train
# Another I left in old Kentucky
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train
# I left my gal in Indiana
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train
# Another I left in ole Missouri
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train
# Oh, the white tops
are a-rollin'
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'
# And when I reach
that promised land
# For my gal,
I'll still be yearnin'... #
The way I figure,
Travis,
these ponies ought
to bring us 30 a head.
And 12 head at 30
comes to, er...
Er...320. >
It does? Well,
that's better yet.
Divided by two...
Well, that makes it, er...
quite a tidy sum.
Yeah. Subtract that
from the tidy sum,
and you'll have
I will?
Say, that's not
bad for four
months' work.
Not bad at all.
Look anything
like them?
No.
Howdy, Marshal.
Howdy.
Good horse.
Mighty gentle.
Horse trader?
Yep. That's my business.
You fellas looking
for a horse trade?
If you are,
I'll trade you
this sorrel horse pretty cheap.
He's sound.
Straight eye,
wind and limb.
THEY NEIGH
Whoa, Bridesmaid.
Be gentle now.
Eight, nine and ten.
Thank you, Marshal.
You got yourself
a good horse for 10.
Of course, he's
got his own little
peculiarities...
..you might say
his own little
failings.
Howdy, Elder.
Howdy, son.
Howdy, ma'am.
These here your horses?
Yeah, they belong
to me and Sandy here.
NEIGHING
Whoa, be gentle.
Easy now.
Eh...gentle, hmm?
Gentle? Ask the marshal.
He can tell you.
What are you
figuring on
asking for them?
Oh...
Well, I'll be
dad-blasted...
Elder Wiggs! Please.
Aw, bears' claws,
Adam!
That's enough to make
the Lord his-sel...
Elder!
All right,
all right,
I repent my words
of wrath.
But I'll be
gol-danged
if I'm paying
any 50 a...
NEIGHING
Whoa, Buttercup.
Whoa.
Be gentle.
Where'd you boys
get these here...
..gentle horses?
Meaning exactly what?
Just keep your
shirt on, son.
Your face looks
honest to me,
even if it is
homely.
Navajo country,
mostly,
southwest of here.
Navajo, huh?
Yep.
Southwest.
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to know
that San Juan river
country, would you?
Yeah, we know it.
What about it, grandpa?
Look here, don't you
be "grandpa-ing" me,
you young
whippersnapper.
I'll pull you
off that fence
and tan your britches
for you...
Now, Elder...
You know,
folks around here
tell me
that there ain't
no through trail
to the San Juan.
Folks is right.
But we've been there.
That little buckboard's
part burro.
It just goes
anywhere.
Hmm...
You boys
mind telling me
if you're...
drinking men?
Nope.
Got a brother's
a drunkard,
though.
Do you ever chaw?
Tried it once.
Use the words
of wrath?
Only tolerable-well.
Are you family men?
No, sir!
NEIGHING
Daisy!
Well...
how would you boys
like to sell us
all these here
gentle horses of yours
at 50 a head
and maybe...
pick yourselves up
an extra 100 or so
on the side?
Doing what?
Wagon master,
that's what.
Leading our wagons
to the San Juan,
to a valley that...
that's been reserved
for us by the Lord...
been reserved
for his people...
so we can plow it
and seed it
and make it fruitful
in His eyes.
Amen.
Are you people
Mormons?
That's why
I keep my hat on
all the time,
so my horns
won't show.
Why, I got
more wives than
Solomon hisself.
At least that's
what folks
around here say.
And if they
don't say it,
they...
they think it.
We're not a big
party, son.
We're just a...
a handful of people
sent out to mark
the trail
and prepare
the ground
for those that
are going to
come after us.
By next summer,
there will be
on the move.
They're counting
on us
to have a crop
ready for them.
And if we don't,
they'll starve
sure as...
..shootin'.
That's why we got
to reach that valley
before the winter
rains come.
We've been praying
that we'd be showed
the way.
It might just be
that you boys
are the answer
to our prayer.
It makes you
feel noble,
being an answer
to a prayer, Travis.
Yeah, it does.
Well, the elder's
offered us a fair
price for our horses.
A fair price
for that crow-bait?!
I never saw...
Elder!
Big strip of country
between here and
the San Juan, Elder.
My guess is,
you can't make it
in a wagon.
Nope.
Better count us out.
Besides,
me and my partner,
we's kind of figuring
on settling
and playing a little
high-low-jick-jack-jenny
and the bean gun.
Owe more
or claim it?
Claim it.
Gambling, huh?
Gambling
with cards.
And 100 people gambling
their lives on us.
Come on, Adam.
We've been
a-wasting our time.
High-low-jick-jack-jenny
and the bean gun.
Thank you, gentlemen.
What are you claiming
for low?
Had the trey.
I didn't see it.
The Mormons got
the fire stirring.
Looks like they're
pulling out.
As long as they're
out of town by 7.30.
That's their deadline.
Mormons,
Cleggses,
show folks,
horse...traders.
I'm in.
# Oh, be thanked, Lord
# For all you give
# For this day
# On this earth. #
Well, folks...
we're going to
have to leave
this hospitable
community
at exactly 7.30.
It's 7.00.
You better get a-moving.
Looks like we've got
a trial ahead of us.
But it's not
the first time.
We've had to go it
alone before,
and we'll have to
go it alone again.
We're tough.
We've had to be
tough,
ever since
Brother Brigham
led our people
across the plains.
Well, they survived,
and dang it...
Elder!
Well, we'll survive, too.
Now put out your fires
and get to your wagons.
Elder,
we'll get there
with the Lord's
help.
That's right,
Sister Ledyard.
But I was
kind of wishing
that them
young horse traders
would give the Lord
a hand.
Sister Ledyard,
supposing you blow
that horn again.
Gosh, all those
women and children.
Yeah, and that
red-headed gal.
What's going
to happen when they
reach that desert?
Oh, I don't know.
We warned them,
didn't we?
Lookee here, Travis,
a good price,
ain't it?
Yeah, but there's
a lot easier ways
to make a living.
# I left my gal
in old Virginny
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train
# Another I left
in ole Missouri
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train. #
Well, Sandy,
I'll meet you
at the river.
Looks like
we got a job.
Yes, sir!
Yee-hah!
Say, Elder!
Head 'em west.
West? Why?
The Lord didn't
provide any water
the way
you're heading.
I knowed you'd
give the Lord
a hand, son.
You owe me
Payable
at the San Juan.

GUITAR PLAYS
Hey, gosh!
Do I hear music?
It sounds like music!
If I'm not loco,
so do I.
Do you...do you suppose
it's Navajos?
I never heard of a Navajo
playing a guitar.
Come to think of it,
neither have I.
Miss Phyffe,
we have company.
Thank you.
Dr Hall...
Gus!
We have
an audience.
Horses.
Ma'am, I heard
your music...
Got a match?
Yeah.
You might offer
a lady a drink.
You mean this stuff?
Oh...
Not that stuff.
We've been drinking that
for three days.
Water.
Just a drink of water.
Sandy, you idiot!
Don't stand
there like a fool!
Get the lady
some water!
And so,
with their water all gone,
Mr Peachtree here
poured a couple of quarts
of this lightning elixir
into a bucket and give it
to their mule.
Last they seen,
she was going over
the hill like a Kansas twister.
And here they've been
ever since.
Now, these people,
they have what I used to call
in my sinning days,
a hoochy-koochy show.
Oh! Why, I do declare!
The question is, what are
we going to do with them?
Give them a team
and water to get them
to Crystal City.
Well, er,
Mr Peachtree here
says that the professor
wasn't exactly popular
in Crystal City.
That's where
they come from.
You mean they
was run out.
Well, they was
invited out,
like we was.
Anyhow, they
started out for California.
The poor handsome man,
being driven out like that
with his wife and daughter.
That ain't exactly
the way it is,
Sister Ledyard.
Miss Denver,
the young one there,
she ain't
his daughter.
And Miss Fleuretty,
dang-blasted fine figure
of a woman that she is.
Well, she
ain't exactly...
That settles it.
Give them
what they need,
and let's get on.
I don't believe
they're up to
travelling alone.
Well, they will be
when they're sober.
We reach the California
trail in a couple days.
Don't think we ought
to take up
with their kind
of people, Elder.
I'm not leaving them,
and that's flat.
You're
hired out to us!
Hold on, both of you.
Just calm down.
I ain't so sure
but what the Lord
put them in our path
for a reason.
As I see it, the Lord ain't
one to waste his energy.
He's gone
to a lot of trouble
getting these people
into this fix.
If I was him,
I wouldn't want anybody
messing up my plans.
Well, putting it
that way...
All right.
Back to your wagons,
folks.
We've wasted enough time.
Blow your horn,
Sister Ledyard.
Wagons west! Wagons west!

Excuse me,
Professor,
but shaving ain't
permitted here.
Kind of low
on water.
Young man,
in all my years
of trouping,
I've never appeared
before my audience
unshaven.
I don't propose
to do so now.
Sorry, sir.
Your apology
is accepted.
Get to your wagon.
You all right?
You shouldn't have
done that, ma'am.
I'm sorry you fell
off your horse.
I mean about
taking a wash
out here in the desert.
That water's
for our horses.
I tell you what...
I won't take
another bath
till you tell me to.
Looks like
you got yourself
an admirer, Denver.
That rube.
Feet hurt, ma'am?
Nope.
Here, try these on.
Did you get these
from that red-headed gal?
You mean
Miss Prudence?
Yes, ma'am.
Is she your wife?
No, ma'am.
How they feel?
Oh...
..fine.
A little large for me,
maybe, but...fine.
Thanks very much, and...
thank your lady friend.
She ain't that
either, ma'am.

Evening.
Me and the boys
seen your fire.
Scared at first
you might be Navajo.
Then I heard
your mountain music.
Said to Floyd here,
"wherever there's
singing and dancing,
"you can be sure
there's Christian folks."
Never did know
a bad man
that had
any music in him.
Thought maybe you might
help out some strangers
down on their luck.
Maybe stake us
for a feed.
You're welcome to share
what little we have.
That's neighbourly,
mister.
Real neighbourly.
Did you hear that,
boys?
These good
God-fearing folks
is bidding us
welcome.
Brother Boulton,
help Brother Jackson
with their stock.
We-uns has been
out hunting
but had nothing
but hard scrabble.
Our pack horses stompeded
with all our grub,
and I fell
and bust my shoulder.
Sister Ledyard,
fix these men
some food.
Thank you, Floyd.
Thank you, Jesse.
Shoulder's
been hurting bad.
Can't hardly sit
my horse no more.
You know who they are,
don't you?
Yep.
I reckon I do.
We've been celebrating
the crossing of the desert
and getting
to the water,
so we're just
going to turn in.
When you folks
finish eating,
if you'll just
stack your plates
up there,
we'll be a-seeing you.
Bless you, Brother.
Don't you worry
about us.
We'll just sit and
enjoy your fire a spell.
Uncle Shiloh.
They're the only ones
toting guns.
You boys ever
draw on anybody?
No, sir.
Just snakes.
SISTER LEDYARD LAUGHS
Turn my eggs over,
sister,
and put some
hot sauce
and chili pepper
on them, please.
What's them words
on your wagon say?
Read them for yourself.
I don't read so good.
Tell me.
It says,
"Doctor A Locksley Hall,
"kickapoo snake oil
"and lightning elixir."
And in the smaller
letters,
"teeth pulled
"and hair restored."
Uncle Shiloh!
Look here what I found!
A doctor!
A doctor.
Well, now, that's
real providential.
Be obliged if you'd
look at my shoulder, doc.
Well, I...
I'm not certain, sir.
Said you was
a doctor.
A doctor, yes,
but I...
I'm not exactly
qualified.
Are you lying?
I hate liars.
My boys would
just as soon shoot a liar
as look at him.
If you're a doc,
you'll fix my shoulder.
If you're lying...
That's a bullet hole.
You've been wounded.
That's right.
That chunk of lead
is still in there.
Get it out.
Yes, sir. It's
real providential.
They got grub,
water,
and a doc
to tend my arm.
And a golden bed
for me to rest up in.
Supposing that marshal
catches up with us?
Then what?
Ain't likely any posse
will look for us
in a mormon wagon train,
now, is it?
That's good
drinking liquor.

Morning, Matthew.
Morning, Cochrell.
Good morning.
I brought you
some water, ma'am.
Thank you.
Won't you stop
and have a bite
of breakfast with us?
Yes, ma'am!
Sandy, let's go.
Uncle Shiloh.
Mr Cleggs,
are you ready?
Yes, sir. Now don't you fret
about me, Brother Wiggs.
I don't intend to.
I expect your people
to go easy
on our food,
obey orders,
mind your language,
and keep
your distance.
We Cleggs ain't used to
being spoke to thataway.
You shut up, Luke.
Elder here has been
right kind to us'n,
so you mind
your manners.
He ain't quite bright.
When you get
your strength back,
you go it
on your own.
Is that understood?
The lord will bless you
for this, Brother.
He marks
the sparrow's fall.
Hitch up,
Sister Crenley!
We're moving,
Brother Fitzsimmons!
Moving out,
Brother Hightower.
Get ready.
That wasn't very
healthy, Elder.
You afraid of them?
Yeah. I am.
What about you, Son?
Who, me? Huh.
That makes
three of us.
But I'm not letting
the Cleggses know it,
and I'm not letting
my people know it
either.
We're still headed
for the San Juan.
I want us all
to get there.
Your haul,
wagon master.
Lead out!
Wagons west!
Let's go again, everybody!
Heading out!
You dang-blasted idiot,
can't you stand up?
What's the matter?
Oh, you tarnation,
consarned, no-good
idiot.
Elder,
watch your language.
Watch, my foot.
I never saw such a...
Quicksand.
He couldn't help it.
Quicksand?
Oh.
I guess we'll
have to find
a new trail
out of here.
Yeah.
Hold your train!
Hold your train!
Sorry, horse.
Whoa.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddyup.
Giddyup!
Come on, now.
Get up there.
Come on, boy.
Giddyup!
Giddyup! Come on!
Giddyup! Come on!
To tell you the truth,
Sandy, I'm lost.
We passed
through here once.
Remember?
You said that tower
over there
looked like a cathedral
back in Santa Fe.
Yeah, could be.
You bring up
the wagon train.
I'll look it over
a little closer.
All right, Travis.
Navajos, Elder!
Better pull them up!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ho!
Ho!
Put up them guns,
you people.
We got troubles enough.
Never did kill
myself a Navajo.
Ha ha ha ha.
Pull them up,
Mr Perkins.
Indians ahead.

How about a dance?
It's not my music.
As the rule,

Don't go crowding

Look, you don't

I can take care of myself.
I'm used to it.
Sorry, ma'am.
I don't need
sympathy either.
I've done nothing
to be ashamed of,
whatever
your friends say.
We didn't ask to
be picked up by
these bible shouters.
No call to get mad,
ma'am.
Don't call me ma'am.
No, ma'am.
You like him, don't you?
I don't want to see him
full of bullet holes,
if that's what you mean.
Sister Lamanita,
I ain't a dancer.
Better give it a whirl,
Brother Perkins.
SPEAKING NAVAJO
Let me go!
Aah!
Uncle Shiloh!
Brother Boulton,
now think fast.
Strip this man
to the waist
and tie him
to a wagon wheel.
Aah!
Uncle Shiloh!
I wouldn't
interfere.
They ain't whipping
no Cleggses.
Whipping's better
than scalping.
Ain't going to be
no scalping.
How you going to
stop it, Uncle Shiloh?
Aah!
Brother Jackson.
WHIP CRACKS >
Straight ahead,
Mr Peachtree.
This is where
you leave us.
Whoa.
Well, Professor,
here's where
we leave you.
About this team
and the outfit,
I'm not asking payment.
We've got a small colony
in San Bernardino.
Make a contribution
as you pass through.
We'll do that, Elder.
I'm sure you will.
Thank you.
Elder, on behalf of myself,
Miss Phyffe, Miss Denver,
and the entire company,
I should like to take
this opportunity...
It's all right,
Professor.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck,
Miss Fleuretty,
Miss Denver.
Mr Peachtree,
carry on.
Giddyup.
Hey, Sandy.
Sandy, I think
I'll go a-courting.
Sure hope I see you
again, Miss Denver.
Thanks.
Don't bank on it.
We move around.
With
a medicine show,
you have to
to keep healthy.
Move a lot
trading horses, too.
Good thing,
you get to know
a lot of country,
like a valley
I got in mind.
A man could make
a nice cattle ranch
in that valley...
if he didn't mind
being lonesome...
and had someone
to kind of help him
with the cooking
and such.
Goodbye, fella.
Whoa!
Uncle Shiloh wants
you folks back in camp.
Come on.
Let's get a-going.
Whoa!
Let's get a-going.
I'm telling you for
the last time, Elder,
if there's any trouble,
I just got to kill you.
Now, where's
that wagon master
and that
carrot-headed kid?
Come on down here
in front.
Uncle Shiloh,
they're toting guns.
Drop 'em.
Whoa!
Welcome back.
How was California?
It pains me, doc,
to spoil your trip,
but I couldn't rest
thinking of you
traipsing
around the country.
No telling
what you might run into -
Indians, varmints,
or maybe even a posse.
That'd be bad,
wouldn't it?
Real bad.
I assure you, sir...
Get over there
with the rest of them.
Floyd!
Evening.
You can put your hands
down now, folks.
Professor, so it was
like I was saying,
we'll stay together until
we reach the San Juan river.
One big, happy family
with your old Uncle Shiloh
at the head of it.
If you're heading
for the Arizona border,
there's lots better
trails to take.
If a man
knowed the country.
But we don't.
We'll string along
with you folks
so we can
keep an eye on you.
There won't
be any trouble,
will there, Elder?
No, reckon there won't.
Wagons west! Get rolling!
Get in your wagons there!
All right, get it
off your chest.
I got nothing to say.
We're hired as
wagon masters,
not gunfighters.
I never claimed
to be a gunfighter.
I'd have taken
my chances.
I know you would.
I ain't risking 60 lives
on a fool play.
What if we'd got
ourselves killed?
They'd starve
to death
trying to get over
these mountains
or die of thirst
trying to get back
to Crystal City.
No. Without us,
they haven't got
a chance.
What happens when we
reach the San Juan?
Think the Cleggses will tip
their hats and ride away?
We'll handle that
when we come to it.
Yeah.
Want a drink of lightning
liquor, Elder?
GLASS BREAKS
That mormon train
sure come quite
a piece, hasn't it?
Don't suppose they've
seen the Cleggses.
Won't hurt none to ask.
Fill up our canteens
anyway.
Whoa. Whoa!
Wagons, ho!
I'm giving the orders
around here, Elder.
You going
to give the orders
to that sheriff's
posse, too?
Sheriff's posse,
Uncle Shiloh.
Jesse, get in here
with me.
Reese, take
the Perkins' wagon.
Floyd!
You ride with the doc
and them show folk.
You all heard what
Uncle Shiloh said.
Just you be quiet.
Don't say nothing.
Elder, one wrong move
out of anyone,
we start shooting.
Howdy, Elder.
Howdy, Marshal.
Didn't think
you'd make it.
Oh, we've been
moving right along.
Well, we're still
hunting them Cleggses.
Don't suppose
you've seen them.
Well, now, don't seem
hardly likely, does it?
Nope.
Had to ask though.
Happen you see them,
get word to me.
We're camped
down by the old
California cutoff.
They ain't going
to slip past us.
How about
the bacon,
Marshal?
Oh. We're running
low on grub.
Don't suppose you have
an extra side of bacon?
Well, uh...
yeah, I reckon so.
Help yourself.
Thank you, Elder.
I'll get it for you.
Know just where it is.
Thank you.
Round of bacon's
in the second barrel, Elder?
That's right, son.
Here you are, partner.
Ah, thank you.
Think nothing of it.
Marshal.
Howdy, Marshal.
Whose buckskin horse
is this?
Seems like I've seen him
someplace before.
Sure have.
Tried to sell him
to you once.
You can still have
him pretty cheap.
Elder,
you wouldn't be lying
to me, would you?
Well, now, Marshal,
I tell you,
I don't rightly think
I've told a lie to a man
for an awful long time,
and if the circumstances
were such
that a man had a gun
in my back, I...
I guess about now's
as good a time as any.
..tell you.
WHISTLE
Kick him, Marshal!
Ride that dang-blasted...
horse.
If I was you, Wiggs,
I'd be careful
who I took up with.
There's some mighty
unsavoury characters
travelling with you.
That's the lord's
truth, Marshal.
Thanks for the bacon.
Get going!
Wagons west!
There was
a trail there once.
If it ain't washed out,
we'll try it.
Mighty rough going, Elder.
Mighty rough going.
I think we can make it
a-foot or a-horseback,
but my opinion
is the grain wagon
can't make it.
That grain's
more valuable to us
than gold itself.
We just
got to get...
FOOTSTEPS
Did I hear somebody
mention gold?
Gold always
interests me.
You got gold in this
wagon train, Elder?
We were talking
about our seed grain,
Mr Cleggs.
We're getting it across
even if we have to
carry it over bag by bag
on our backs.
Well, now, my boy
Reese won't be
much help to you.
His back's pretty sore
after that whipping
you give him.
We want to talk to you
about that later.
Tomorrow, maybe.
When are you going
to make your play?
Well, son...
did you find the trail
to that promised land?
The old trail's
all washed out,
Elder.
But I think
we can make it.
Sure take a lot
of digging, though.
Digging? What do
you mean, digging?
Oh, sort of
a dug-way.
Sure a lot of
mighty pretty country
over that mountain -
river, valley,
and all.
You better
get yourself
some food
and start
digging.
Well, Elder,
when you get over
in that pretty valley
he's talking about,
I guess we won't
see you no more.
And you won't have
no Cleggses
to tie to wagon wheels
and whip.
Travis,
I got me a gun.
Where did you
get that?
From Miss Prudence.
She got it from
her little brother.
Here's what
I want to do
if you'll back me.
What did you ever
shoot at
besides tin cans
and beer bottles?
Never mind.
We'll take care
of them Cleggses.
Careful that gun
don't go off
and blow
your brains out.
Now there's a sharp turn
right around
that yonder point there.
Are you ready,
wagon master?
Ready, Elder.
All right,
Brother Boulton.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Brother Boulton!
Brother Boulton!
THE CLEGGSES LAUGH
They didn't make it,
Uncle Shiloh.
Kind of dangerous,
huh, Elder?
I'll take the next one
over myself.
Elder Wiggs,
I demand
the privilege
of taking my
wagon over next.
It contains
nothing of value,
including
the driver.
Now, Professor...
Sir, I insist.
Gus... Gus!
Mr Peachtree,
if you please.
I'm going
with you...
you big ham.
Hey! Hey!
Giddyup!
Come on! Hyah!
Giddyup!
Come on!
Hey! Hey!
Giddyup!
Hyah!
Giddyup!
CHEERING
Giddyup! Come on!
CHEERING
Giddyup! Come on!
CHEERING
Everything's
all clear,
Brother Jackson!
Fine, Elder.
Ready?
Ready!
Climb up
and take her across.
Now watch
your wheels.
Keep them
in that dug-way.
Give them their head
upgrade.
Once started,
don't stop.
Keep them going.
Sandy, now...
We're saying
goodbye, Elder.
We're parting
company.
You been real good
to us Cleggses.
Reese, now,
he ain't likely
to forget you.
None of us is.
So it's only fitting
that we give you
something
to remember us by.
That grain wagon...
more valuable
than gold itself.
You said so, Elder.
Son, get down off
of there.
Why? What are you
going to do?
Elder, get up there.
To save you
from asking why,
I'm going to
tell you.
You'll have
the privilege
of taking that
grain wagon over,
only it's going
to be at a dead run,
and them wheels
won't be in no rut.
Luke, go down
by that lead team.
Reese, I'll let you
whip them up.
Reese!
Whoa!
Hold it! Ho!
Whoa! Ho!
Ho!
Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.
My boys...
you killed my boys.
Good boys they was,
too.
Jesse.
Luke!
Ho, boy!
Ho. Easy.
Luke was
my oldest boy.
I thought you
never drew on a man.
That's right,
sir...
only on snakes.
# Come, come, ye saints
# No toil
nor labour fear
# But, with joy,
wend your way
# Though hard to you
# This journey
may appear
# Grace shall be
as your day
# 'Tis better far
for us to strive
# Our useless cares
from us to drive
# Do this and joy
your hearts will swell... #
Well, I'll be doggone.
I'll be doggone.
# Way out west, there's
a dance a-bein' done
# The chuckawallas do it,
so it must be lots of fun
# All around the floor,
you can see them swing
# And listen to the music
as they gaily sing
# Right foot, left foot,
clap hands, and then
# Swing right around
and do it all again
# Chuckawalla, chuckawalla,
chuckawalla swing
# We'll dance till the floors
and the rafters ring
# Put your arms around her
and go swinging down the floor
# When you do it once
# You're gonna want
to do it more
# High on your toes,
now stomp your heels
# You'll know just how
the chuckawalla feels
# I left my gal
in old Virginny
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train
# White tops are
a-rollin', rollin'
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'
# And when I reach
that promised land
# For my gal
I'll still be yearnin'
# White tops are
a-rollin', rollin'
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'
# And when I reach
that promised land
# For my gal
I'll still be yearnin'
# Wagons west are rollin'
# Out where
winds are blowin'
# 'Cross rivers and plains
# Through sand
and through rain
# Rolls a mighty
wagon train
# Wagons west are rollin'
# White tops are
a-rollin', rollin'
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'
# There's a new little gal
in the promised land
# Already I'm a-yearnin'
# Wagons west are rollin'
# Out where
winds are blowin'
# 'Cross rivers and plains
# Through sand
and through rain
# Rolls a mighty
wagon train... #
