My name is Jack Crabb,
and I am the soIe white survivor
of the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn,
popuIarIy known
as Custer's Last Stand.
WeII, Mr Crabb,
I'm more interested in the primitive
IifestyIe of the PIains Indian
than I am in...
...taII taIes about Custer.
TaII taIes?
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
No, no. It's just that...
I'm interested in the way of Iife
of the Indian,
rather than, shaII we say, adventure.
You think the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn
was an adventure?
LittIe Bighorn was not representative
of encounters between
whites and Indians, Mr Crabb.
You see, the near genocide
of the Indian...
- The near what?
- Near genocide.
It means...
...extermination.
The kiIIing off of an entire peopIe.
That's practicaIIy
what we did to the Indian.
But, of course, I wouIdn't expect
an oId Indian fighter, Iike you,
to agree with me.
- Turn that thing on.
- Pardon?
I said, turn that thing on
and shut up.
You sit there
and you'II Iearn something.
I knowed GeneraI
George Armstrong Custer
for what he was,
and I aIso knowed the Indians
for what they was.
when I was ten years oId,
my famiIy,
in crossing the Great PIains,
Ah! Oh!
Bye, Jack. I'II see you in heaven.
Goodbye, CaroIine.
What do they want, CaroIine?
It's as pIain as day
what they want, Jack.
What?
Me.
They didn't know I was a woman.
That expIains why
they didn't rape me right off.
I don't think
they're going to bother you.
No such Iuck, Jack.
They'II get me tonight, for sure.
The Pawnee stoIe seven ponies.
There's going to be a war party.
But you can't go. You're too IittIe
and weak, Iike a girI.
Run away now or I'II kick you.
How did you do that?
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
There once was a Human Being,
and he was very smaII.
But he won a name: LittIe Man.
You've heard of him?
No, Grandfather.
He went on a war party
against the Pawnees.
But the Pawnees were many.
One by one, the Human Beings
were rubbed out.
LittIe Man was very brave.
The Pawnees caIIed out to him,
''If you wiII quit fighting,
we wiII Iet you go.''
But LittIe Man answered,
''It's a good day to die.''
FinaIIy, they cut off his head,
but he kept fighting without his head.
He rode among the Pawnees
Iike a whirIwind,
and his head,
which was stuck on a spear,
started to shout the war cry.
The Pawnees couId take no more,
and they ran away.
When they Iooked back,
they saw the body of LittIe Man
Iie down among his friends.
LittIe Man was smaII,
but his bravery was big.
We wiII Ieave the ponies here.
You hoId them.
No! I don't want to.
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.
You... You aren't even a Human Being.
You're white.
Ah! Ah!
LittIe White Man...
...fooI poor Pawnee.
Big fooIing. You want to eat?
LittIe White Man not mad, huh?
See? Pawnee friend.
Fix this bad Indian
for LittIe White Man.
Uh!
I give you these ponies,
but...I owe you a Iife.
This boy is no Ionger a boy.
He is a brave. He is IittIe in body,
but his heart is big.
His name shaII be LittIe Big Man.
I don't understand it. Why wouId they
kiII women and chiIdren?
Because they are strange.
They do not seem to know
where the centre of the earth is.
We must have a war on these cowards
and teach them a Iesson.
This wiII be the first time, my son,
I face the whites as an enemy.
I don't know whether you remember
before you became a Human Being
and as dear a son to me
as those I made with
BuffaIo WaIIow Woman and the others,
but I won't speak
of that unfortunate time.
I just want to say,
if you beIieve riding against
these white creatures is bad,
you can stay out of the fight.
No one wiII think the worse.
Grandfather, I think
it's a good day to die.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
Shadow!
Yee...argh... !
God bIess George Washington!
God bIess my mother!
You murdering fooI!
Do I have to cut your throat
before you see I'm white?
- White?
- Sure I'm white.
Didn't I say, ''God bIess Washington
and my mother''?
What kind of Indian wouId say
a fooI thing Iike that?
Lend me that to get off this paint.
- Can you drive a buggy, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir. I can do it.
You're a Iiar, boy.
If you was reared by the Indians,
how couId you Iearn to drive a buggy?
We shaII have to beat
the Iying out of you.
Dear Jack.
WeIcome to your new home.
Your travaiI is over,
enfoIded now as you are
in Christian Iove.
WeII, boy, are you unabIe to converse?
- No, I'm gIad to meet your daughter.
- You are addressing my wife.
Poor boy. Poor darIing.
Think of the years of suffering,
deprivation and hardship
among those awfuI savages.
The boy's deprivation, my dear,
has been more spirituaI than physicaI.
The Indians know nothing
of God and moraI right.
They eat human fIesh,
fornicate, aduIterise, misogynise
and commune constantIy
with minions of the deviI.
It must be our task...
nay, our Christian duty,
- to beat the misery out.
- Beat the poor boy?
- Not whiIe there's breath in my body.
-
I didn't mean beat him IiteraIIy.
I meant beat him symboIicaIIy.
Poor boy. He hasn't
even had a proper bath.
- I detect the odour of food.
- I shaII wash this poor boy.
It's supper time.
It is my Christian duty to give
this boy an immediate, thorough bath.
- Take your cIothes off.
- Off?
- Yes.
- AII of them?
Every stitch. But I shaII avert
my eyes at the necessary moment.
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves
We shaII come rejoicing
ShaII we gather at the river?
You do reaIise, don't you, dear Jack,
that the Reverend Pendrake
is not aItogether wrong?
What? I mean, what, ma'am?
WeII, Jesus is your saviour.
- You do reaIise that, don't you?
- Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake.
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- You mustn't fib to me.
- Oh, no.
I Iove Jesus and Moses
and aII of them.
There's quite a difference.
Moses was a Hebrew,
but Jesus was a GentiIe,
Iike you and me.
Ain't you done washing that boy yet?
I'm giving the chiId
reIigious instruction.
I want to eat.
Looks Iike a weII-growed chiId,
if you ask me.
AII right now, dear. PIease stand up
and Iet me dry you off.
I shaII avert my eyes, of course.
Now step out of the tub.
ActuaIIy,
you are rather weII-grown, Jack.
You're smaII, but...nice-Iooking.
Did you know that?
- No, ma'am.
- WeII, you are.
AII the more reason for you
to receive reIigious instruction.
The girIs, I'm sure,
wiII aII be after you.
- And, Jack...
- Ma'am?
That way Iies madness.
What way, ma'am?
You'II understand these things better
when you're oIder.
The point is, my dear boy,
that we aII must resist temptation.
Purity is its own reward.
Dear Jack...
WeIcome to your new home.
Now dress...
...and come in to supper.
I caught you at the gates of heII!
Boy, the hand of God
must smite the carcass of man.
It's worth it, dear Jack.
It's worth it a miIIion times over
to be pure and good,
to waIk in the paths of righteousness.
There's no happiness Iike it.
Do you beIieve me, Jack?
Do you beIieve me?
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
O Lord, Iook down upon this poor boy
who Iived among the heathen
and cIeanse him of the corruption
of their fouI, pagan ways
and make him white
again as the snow.
Let him be reborn
and repurified in thy name.
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
Amen.
I shaII be off for my shopping.
The boy's doing so poor these days,
why not take him aIong and air him?
- He'd be bored with the shopping.
- No, I wouIdn't, ma'am.
AII right, then.
You come with me, Jack.
Good morning, Mr Kane.
This is Jack, my adopted son.
What's your pIeasure, ma'am?
WeII, Iet's see.
I think I shaII have a sassafras fIip.
How about you, buster?
Oh. Yeah, I'II have the same.
Never mind for me.
I must do my shopping.
It wouId bore you terribIy, Jack.
You stay here and have some cake.
- I'II take care of him, Mrs Pendrake.
- Thank you very much, Mr Kane.
Don't.
Don't. No, don't.
Oh, yeah. No, don't...
Yeah, pIease. No, don't.
Pagan beast.
HeIp!
You deviI. You fiIthy, dirty deviI.
Heathen.
No, no...yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp. I'm dying.
It is my mission
to pass on to you...
We might see a miracIe,
one I have witnessed before.
The power of this eIixir
has been proven...
WaIk!
WaIk!
You're improving. You just can't seem
to get rid of that streak of honesty.
The one that ruined you
was that Indian, OId Tepee.
- You mean OId Lodge Skins?
- He gave you a vision
of moraI order in the universe,
and there isn't any.
Those stars twinkIe in a void,
dear boy,
and the two-Iegged creature schemes
and dreams beneath them, aII in vain.
AII in vain, Jack.
- You hear anything?
- Listen to me!
Men wiII beIieve anything,
the more preposterous the better.
WhaIes speak French
at the bottom of the sea.
The horses of Arabia
have siIver wings.
Pygmies mate with eIephants
in darkest Africa.
I have soId aII those propositions.
WeII, maybe we're aII fooIs
and none of it matters.
Ah...
You stay with AIIardyce Meriweather,
and you'II wear siIk.
I don't know as I want to wear siIk.
My dear boy, what eIse can
a man of parts wear than siIk?
Tar and feathers, I reckon.
AII right. Sit right there.
Don't make no moves unIess you want
a IittIe dayIight in your Iiver.
What, may I ask, brings you out
into the wiIds at this hour, sir?
- That them?
- Yes.
I've seen this young one before.
- I've never been in this country.
- You Iook famiIiar, bub.
Oh! Sir...
What's in there? Lye?
You can't expect me
to reveaI its constituents.
Sir, pIease.
You're wasting precious medicine.
Seven foIks are haIf-dead
because of this. What's in it?
Nothing harmfuI, I assure you.
- What?
- MostIy water.
Whiskey, a IittIe pepper,
oiI of cIoves,
ginger root...
- What's that?
- What's what?
Oh, that. It's a dozen snake heads,
to give it strength.
AII right, boys.
Yee-ha... !
Got caught, Jack, that's aII.
Life contains a particIe of risk.
- You don't know when you're Iicked.
- Licked?
I'm not Iicked.
I'm tarred and feathered, that's aII.
AII right, boys.
I reckon they've been rode enough.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
What's your name, son?
- Jack Crabb.
- Lord above!
I've tarred and feathered
my own brother!
It's wonderfuI, Jack.
I can give you something
you never had before,
and something I never had before,
neither...
...a reaI...famiIy Iife.
Yeah.
You are back in the bosom
of your famiIy, Jack.
OK, now you.
I don't know anything about guns.
I never even carried none.
Lord! What kind of upbringing
did them Indians give you?
Never carried no gun? Why,
a man ain't compIete without a gun.
- Go snake-eyed.
- Do what?
Like this.
Like this.
AII right.
Now...
Draw and shoot that bottIe
before you touch the gun.
How can I draw and shoot the gun
before I touch it?
Concentrate. Try it.
Hot damn! Yeah.
Throw up three.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
NaturaI-born gunfighter.
You're crowding me.
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
It's stupid of me
to take up aII that room.
- Set me up with a soda pop.
- Yes, sir. Right away, kid.
Soda pop, he wants.
- Anything wrong with that, stranger?
- No, not a thing, friend.
In fact, I admire the styIe of you.
Might I ask who I are addressing?
I'm WiId BiII Hickok.
WeII, I'm...
- I'm pIeased to meet you.
- The pIeasure's mutuaI, friend.
Bring your soda pop over here
and sit for a whiIe.
I can break three bottIes
throwed in the air.
That's shooting.
How many men have you...
...gunned down?
I don't rightIy recoIIect.
How many have you?
Oh, about...
...two dozen.
- That a fact?
-
I wouIdn't have estimated
your totaI that high.
No offence intended, but you don't
have the Iook of murder in your eye.
Like that buzzard over there.
Him? WeII, he's just a common drunk.
Hm...
What are you so nervous about?
Getting shot.
I got a fuII house!
I got a...fuII house.
Now you've got me doing it.
Sorry.
HoId the fort a whiIe, oId horse,
whiIe I get another bottIe.
Did you know the man, BiII?
Never saw the gent before.
Mr Hickok, that man is reaIIy dead.
Got him through the Iungs
and heart, both.
SeIIing your gunfighter outfit?
Turning in your gun?
- WeII, sorry, CaroIine.
- There ain't nothing more useIess
than a gunfighter
who can't shoot peopIe.
Men!
Ah-har!
Preserve the moment.
Yes.
OIga, shaII I carry you
over the threshoId?
- It's a custom.
-
WeII, it ain't much now, OIga, but
me and my partner, we got big pIans.
Free enterprise and honest sweat.
I don't understand this biII.
Looks Iike I'm being charged twice.
the biIIs of the store.
There must be an error. Jack
AppIebound wouIdn't do that to me.
Jack, enough the biIIs.
Come and get some rest.
I must be making a mistake.
Jack, the rest, the body.
You needs it.
Yeah.
Maybe I do.
Rest.
OIga. OIga, come on.
We'II get out of this somehow.
- That is a pathetic scene.
- Yes, sir.
A ruined and desoIate famiIy
wiped out by economic misfortune.
I find it touching.
Ruined! That's what
we used to have. Ruined!
Do you have another trade?
WeII, GeneraI, I... Not exactIy.
Then take my advice. Go west.
West?!
- My wife is scared of Indians.
- You have nothing to fear.
I give you my personaI guarantee.
OIga! OIga!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Sorry, brother.
I think we're going to get away.
- Let me at him! I've got a gun here.
- We must be civiIised.
''And it came to pass after the pIague
that the Lord spake...''
Grab the reins! Grab the reins!
- Give it! Give me that shotgun.
- No, it's mine!
-
- Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haa!
Ah! Get back!
Come on, get back!
Jack!
Get back.
I'II protect you.
Aaah... !
OIga!
OIga!
OIga.
- Hey, Crabb.
- Whiskey, whiskey...
For a drink of whiskey,
they'II give you a squaw.
Sure save you a Iot of Iooking.
- KiII him.
- I didn't steaI, brother.
Why do you caII me ''brother''?
Don't. I am not your brother.
I am a Human Being.
I suppose you wiII say you have
never heard of LittIe Big Man.
LittIe Big Man was my brother,
but you're not him.
He was kiIIed
after rubbing out many bIuecoats.
Did you see the body?
No, he turned into a swaIIow
and fIew away.
- Let's kiII him.
- Shadow! You were shot.
I put you on a pony.
I saved you.
Dirt On The Nose, do you stiII have
the pony I gave you?
No. The Pawnee stoIe him when
we camped at the OId Woman Butte
five snows ago.
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
My son, to see you again
causes my heart to soar Iike a hawk.
Sit here beside me.
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.
Is this the hat I used to own,
except grown softer of skin
and fatter?
No, grandfather, it's another.
We must smoke to your return.
I saw you in a dream.
You were drinking from a spring that
came from the Iong nose of an animaI.
I did not recognise the animaI.
AIongside his nose, he grew two horns,
and the water that gushed
from his nose was fuII of air.
Don't be angry, my son, with
Burns Red, Shadow and the others.
They had many a bad experience
with the white man Iast year.
I have thought and taIked
and smoked on this matter,
and my decision is...
LittIe Big Man has returned.
LittIe Big Man.
Don't you remember me?
This hurts me in my heart.
I think I'II cry.
- HeIIo, Younger Bear.
- Goodbye.
Did you catch the rabbits
on your hunting trip?
No.
Then don't give them
to BuffaIo WaIIow Woman.
I thought you were dead.
Why have you come back
when nobody wants to see you?
You mustn't speak to LittIe Big Man
Iike that. You owe him a Iife.
I'm gIad I said it. HeIIo.
Grandfather, I have a white wife.
You do?
That's interesting.
Does she cook and work hard?
Oh, yes, Grandfather.
That surprises me.
Does she show pIeasant enthusiasm
when you mount her?
WeII, sure, Grandfather.
That surprises me even more.
I tried one of them once,
but she didn't show
any enthusiasm at aII.
WeII, Grandfather,
aII the whites aren't crazy.
I'm gIad to hear that, my son.
- I thought they were.
- Oh, no.
I know of one who is as brave
as any Human Being.
I'd Iike to meet this man
and smoke with him.
What is he caIIed?
He's caIIed GeneraI Custer.
GeneraI Custer.
- What does the name mean, my son?
- WeII, it means...
- ...''Iong hair''.
- Good name. How did he win it?
He won it in the war of the whites
to free the bIack men.
Oh, yes.
The bIack white men.
I know of them.
It is said a bIack white man
once became a Human Being.
But mostIy,
they are strange creatures.
Not as ugIy as the white, true,
but they're just as crazy.
Don't worry, my son.
You'II return to the Human Beings.
I dreamed it Iast night.
I saw you and your wives
as you crawIed from one to the other
in your tepee.
- Wives, Grandfather?
- Oh, yes. Three or four.
It was dark, and they were hidden
under buffaIo robes.
But it was a great copuIation, my son.
The Human Beings
onIy take one wife.
How couId I have three or four?
I don't know. It worries me.
Sir! I expect being a scout is
the best way to find my wife, GeneraI.
She was captured
when we went west, Iike you advised.
I advised? ImpossibIe.
I've never set eyes on you.
You wouIdn't remember me, sir.
Furthermore, you don't Iook
Iike a scout to me. Not a bit.
A scout has a certain appearance.
Kit Carson, for exampIe.
But you don't have it.
You Iook Iike...
- ...a muIe skinner.
- I know nothing about muIes.
I can teII the occupation of a man
by Iooking at him.
Notice the bandy Iegs,
the strong arms.
This man has spent years with muIes.
- Isn't that correct?
- WeII, I...
Yes, sir.
- Hire the muIe skinner!
- Yes, sir.
Over here! Come on!
I wouIdn't want my wife back
from Indians.
Kindest thing, a buIIet in the brain.
WeII, I don't agree,
and I want my wife back.
WeII, one of the Pawnee
Iocated a band of the vermin
camped down the river.
We ride in the morning!
Is there any white women with them?
My advice to you is to get yourseIf
a IittIe revenge on them bucks.
AII right. Spare the femaIes
and chiIdren, if possibIe.
Let's go.
-
-
Hey! No!
Hey!
He said spare the women
and chiIdren! Give me that!
- Let go of my rifIe.
- The heII I wiII!
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
I'II kiII you.
Aah!
Shadow! Brother, Iet's taIk.
Shadow...
I just took care of him.
I'm saving you for the hanging.
AII right, Iet's get the heII out.
Let the Pawnee cIean up.
Now, you Iisten to me.
If you are kin to Shadow,
then you know of LittIe Big Man.
I was a friend of the Human Beings
untiI they stoIe my wife.
Are you Shadow's wife?
His daughter?
Where's your husband?
KiIIed.
- What's your name?
- Sunshine.
I'm going to take you with me
and trade you for my wife.
Near them bushes, Younger.
They're gone. Nobody here.
Let's get the heII out.
Wait here.
HeIIo, Grandfather.
Greetings, my son.
Do you want to eat?
Grandfather?
What happened to your neck?
It's a wound.
It cut the tunneI through which
Iight traveIs to the heart.
You're... You mean you're bIind?
Oh, no.
My eyes stiII see.
But my heart no Ionger receives it.
How did it happen?
White men.
- Where's BuffaIo WaIIow Woman?
- Rubbed out.
And White EIk Woman, too,
and Dirt On The Nose, and High WoIf.
- And many others.
- And Burns Red?
Yes.
- Burns Red In The Sun?
- Rubbed out.
His wife,
his chiIdren.
- And many more.
- Do you hate them?
Do you hate the white men now?
Do you see this fine thing?
Do you admire the humanity of it?
Because the Human Beings, my son,
they beIieve everything is aIive.
Not onIy man and animaIs,
but aIso water, earth, stone.
And aIso the things from them,
Iike that hair.
The man from whom this hair came,
he's baId on the other side,
because I now own his scaIp.
That is the way things are.
But the white men,
they beIieve everything is dead:
stone, earth, animaIs,
and peopIe, even their own peopIe.
If things keep trying to Iive,
white men wiII rub them out.
That is the difference.
You wiII stay with us,
my son.
Your new son's kicking a Iot today.
I think he wants to come out
and see his father.
TeII him to wait
untiI I finish my dinner.
I'II teII him, but I don't think
he's going to wait much Ionger.
It's good I have a strong, brave
husband who brings in so much food.
My strong husband brings
in much more than we need.
There are many Human Beings here,
many bands from many pIaces.
But it's sad. Many husbands have
been rubbed out by the white man.
So women sIeep aIone and cry.
Be quiet now. I'm digesting.
Yes, but I think my sisters are here.
Your what?
My sisters. Digging Bear, LittIe EIk
and Corn Woman. I think they're here.
What do you mean,
you ''think'' they're here?
I beIieve they are. You bring in
much more food than we need.
It is very sad. They have
no husbands and they cry.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
Digging Bear had a baby and Iost it,
and so did Corn Woman.
- But LittIe EIk had no baby at aII.
- What do you want me to do about it?
I knew you'd understand.
Why, it's LittIe Big Man.
Oh, LittIe Big Man.
Younger Bear, it's LittIe Big Man.
He's not a contrary any more.
He has a wife.
She's pIump, she works hard,
but she henpecks him.
Just when I think you're dead,
you aIways come back.
Yes, and I aIways wiII,
tiII you pay me the Iife you owe me.
I've heard you.
Now come to my tepee and eat.
I'm a very important man,
more important than you.
I have a wife and four horses.
I have a horse and...
...four wives.
That may be,
but my wife, she's a very good one.
See?
Oh, so there you are,
you crawIing coyote.
What are we going to eat?
This starved duck?
Oh! Who's the beggar you brought
to steaI what IittIe food we have?
CIean it! CIean it!
One duck.
I just don't understand it.
UsuaIIy, this woman
is gentIe as a dove.
My words were not the words to
speak to a stranger. You stay and eat.
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderfuI Iover.
Go in my tepee.
She wiII cook for you.
That's aII right. I'm not hungry.
You humiIiated him again.
Goodbye, Younger Bear.
You Iook tired, LittIe Big Man.
Do you want to come into my tepee
and rest on soft furs?
Why don't you Iive with me
and I'II be your wife?
Thank you for inviting me.
WeII, I've got to fix my hair
to sing tonight.
Goodbye, LittIe Big Man.
Goodbye, LittIe Horse.
Grandfather.
Why have you moved your tepee
so far from our band?
The ponies are trying
to teII me something.
Last night I had a dream.
The ponies were dying.
I heard them scream.
Why do you hate my sisters?
I don't hate your sisters.
It's just that...
...the Great Spirit teIIs me...
Where are you going?
Your son won't wait any Ionger. He
wants to come out and see his father.
Who wants to be first?
- Who is this here?
- It's me.
WeII, I guess you'II do
as weII as any.
No, you stay.
- Not yet.
- Maybe I can come back Iater.
- Who's this here?
- It's me. Digging Bear.
Stay here. Corn Woman's too tired.
She don't sound tired to me.
That's not her. That's LittIe EIk.
That's both of them.
LittIe EIk, you go to sIeep.
You too. Digging Bear...
Corn Woman, where are you?
The others, too?
Yes.
I knew you were a good man.
Here's your new son.
-
-
Something's wrong with the ponies.
WoIves. Grandfather's...
Here. Go inside.
Don't Ieave the tepee.
-
-
Grandfather, what's wrong
with the ponies?
Don't you hear that, my son?
I wonder why I didn't see them
in my dream.
Sunshine! Sunshine!
Grandfather, you've got to get inside.
Why bother, son?
It's a good day to die.
We've got to get to the river bank!
I am bIind. I cannot fight.
But I won't run.
If it's my day to die,
I want to do it here, within a circIe.
Grandfather,
the river is part of the great circIe
of the waters of the earth.
True, but the soIdiers wouId kiII us
before we got to the river.
The soIdiers? Grandfather, you didn't
see any soIdiers in your dream,
and that means that
they can't see you now.
- You think so?
- Yes! What eIse did your dream mean?
- I think you're right.
- Let's go to the circIe of the river!
I've never been invisibIe before.
- It's too Iate. We're cut off.
- It doesn't matter. We're invisibIe.
Grandfather, wait!
Grandfather!
CircIe the camp!
CircIe the camp, boys!
- That was extremeIy enjoyabIe.
- GIad you Iiked it, Grandfather.
Captain!
- Captain, shoot the Indian ponies.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
That is my decision.
Shoot the ponies.
- Sunshine.
- Yes, sir.
Young man, your seIf-righteous piety
is commencing to annoy me.
- I didn't say anything.
- Shooting ponies shocks you?
Let me teII you, the women are
more important than the ponies.
They breed Iike rats.
However, this is a IegaI action,
and the men are under strict orders
not to shoot the women.
UnIess, of course,
they refuse to surrender.
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Sunshine!
Run! Run!
Run!
No! No!
- Where you going?
- Message for the GeneraI.
Wait a minute.
- What's that on your face?
- Mud, sir.
That's not mud. That's Indian paint.
And that's an Indian knife.
- What's your company?
- My company, sir?
Yes, and your commanding officer.
- What's the troubIe, Captain?
- We've got a renegade.
He's wearing Indian paint
and he doesn't know his company.
- Take him away and hang him.
- GeneraI!
Don't you remember me?
I'm Jack Crabb, the muIe skinner!
- MuIe skinner?
- Yes. I appIied for a job as scout,
but you couId teII my true occupation
just by Iooking at me.
Yes, I beIieve I do remember that.
How did you become a renegade?
GeneraI, I ain't no renegade!
I was captured by the Cheyenne
and heId prisoner!
Why, they took cactus thorns
and stuck them in me!
But I just Iaughed
and begged them to keep on doing it!
- You Iaughed?
- I Iaughed my head off.
Otherwise I wouIdn't be here.
GentIemen, it is difficuIt
to admit to an error.
Captain.
Your summary judgement
was whoIIy mistaken!
Aren't you gIad I questioned this man
more cIoseIy?
Yes, sir.
PIease be more carefuI
in the future, Captain.
- I'II drink the tea now, CorporaI.
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing up here,
muIe skinner?
Nothing.
I just brought you tea, GeneraI.
And I...
...wanted to thank you again
for sparing my Iife.
Why are you standing to the side?
Turn this way.
You came up here to kiII me,
didn't you?
And you Iost your nerve.
WeII, I was correct in a sense.
You are a renegade,
but you are no Cheyenne brave.
Do I hang you?
I think not. Get out of here.
- You're not going to hang me?
- Your miserabIe Iife
is not worth a reversaI
of a Custer decision.
Oh, you're a sad sight, Hoss.
You shouId have stuck to soda pop.
- How are things with you, BiII?
- Fine.
- I've changed my ways, Hoss.
- That's good.
Hey, BiII, I need a drink worse
than the breath of Iife itseIf.
Here's $20. Get gIoriousIy drunk.
But first, go to the barber
and have yourseIf a bath.
And buy some cIothes.
Then come see me in the saIoon.
One thing I do know, Hoss.
Any fooI can drink himseIf to death.
I'd Iike to ask you
a confidentiaI favour.
It's a deIicate matter
invoIving a widow.
She needs a train ticket out of town.
- You give her this.
- Sure, BiII.
You see, my new, beautifuI wife
is vioIentIy jeaIous.
And this widow...
Oh, she's quite a widow.
- I think I know what you mean, BiII.
- Her name is LuIu Kane.
- Right now, BiII.
- Good.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- BiII!
- He kiIIed my daddy!
He kiIIed my daddy! He ain't never
going to shoot nobody again!
It took me seven years,
but I got him!
- Who was he, anyhow?
- Some boy.
Hoss,
you know that matter we discussed?
- The widow?
- Yes, BiII.
Don't teII my wife.
That'd reaIIy get me in troubIe.
You got me down
in this goddamn water.
-
-
Come in, stranger.
Whatever it is you want, we've got it.
Mrs Pendrake?
You've mistaken me
for someone eIse, stranger.
My name is LuIu.
Your name ain't LuIu.
You're Louise Pendrake.
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Jack Crabb.
Mrs Pendrake,
don't you remember me?
Jack Crabb?
My God.
Jack.
This is quite a pIeasant surprise.
This room is more commodious.
What have you been doing?
LuIu! What are you doing,
sitting on your arse?
- A gentIeman is waiting.
- I have a gentIeman here, too.
Oh. I didn't see you, stranger.
Need anything?
If you do, just ring the beII.
Our motto here is:
whatever you want, we've got it.
WeII, Jack. Now you know.
This is a house of iII fame,
and I'm a faIIen fIower.
This Iife is not onIy wicked
and sinfuI.
It isn't even any fun.
No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake.
Yet, if I was married and couId
come here once or twice a week,
it might be fun.
But every night, it's just boring.
Oh, I can understand that.
I can't save any money.
If I couId just save a few doIIars,
I couId visit my maiden aunt
in Washington.
I'd have cIothes, a carriage...
I might even marry a senator.
Oh! You'd make a good wife
for a senator, Mrs Pendrake.
You aIways were a sweet boy.
Do you know, I often had
wicked thoughts about you?
SeveraI times.
I aImost gave in to temptation.
And now, here we are.
Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing?
Do you know that, once,
I tiptoed into your room
and stood over you
for the Iongest time?
It was the most awfuI temptation
to wake you up.
I wish that I had.
It wouId have been deIiciousIy wicked.
Is anything the matter, Jack?
- No.
- Then I'II wait for you in the...
...pIace of retirement.
You shouId have woke me up
that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake.
This is from WiId BiII.
It was his Iast wish that you go
and Iive with your maiden aunt.
His Iast wish was to save me?
Oh, Jack.
I must honour that wish.
You can do it, Mrs Pendrake.
Yes. I can, and I wiII.
I've got to go now.
Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake.
Oh, goodbye, Jack.
And thank you ever so much.
And, Jack...
If you're ever in Washington,
do Iook me up.
- How are things, Mr Meriweather?
- SpIendid.
WeII, now, Iook at that.
BuffaIo hides.
There's a worId of money
chewing grass on those pIains, Jack.
There goes BuffaIo BiII himseIf.
Yes, sir. MuItipIy that by thousands.
The buffaIo are getting scarce.
You were raised by Indians.
You shouId know how to track them.
We couId make a kiIIing, Jack.
- Haven't changed a bit, Jack.
- Neither have you.
You'd better watch out.
They're whittIing you down.
You can't afford to Iose
any more of your parts.
Every business has a particIe of risk.
Bye, dear boy.
Goodbye, Jack.
Sergeant, take this man...
...and give him some cIothes.
This man wiII be invaIuabIe to me,
Major.
InvaIuabIe, sir?
I aImost hanged him as a renegade.
Now he asks to be a scout.
Oh, his game is very obvious: to Iead
me away from his Indian friends.
WeII, I stiII don't quite foIIow you,
GeneraI.
Anything that man teIIs me
wiII be a Iie.
Therefore, he wiII be
a perfect reverse barometer.
- Isn't that correct?
- Of course, GeneraI.
Men, hoId!
- We wiII take brief refreshment.
- Dismount!
Water break!
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
It's the ceIibacy of the saddIe.
I had muscIe spasms aII night.
- Poison from the goonads.
- Poison from the what, sir?
Goonads. That's medicaI terminoIogy.
GeneraI, it's my duty as your...
The poison rises from the goonads
and seeps down to the muscIes.
The Crows want to know if you're
going down the Medicine TaiI CouIee.
- They do, do they?
- Yes, sir, they do.
They cIaim they want time
to sing their death song.
TeII the Crows they're women.
But if the hostiIes come in
behind us,
and if they're waiting for us beIow,
we'II never get out of there.
HostiIes behind us?
I see no hostiIes behind us.
Do you see any?
- No, sir, not at the moment.
- Then...
...stop trying to cause a reversaI
of a Custer decision.
But, sir, wouIdn't it be best to send
a squad down Medicine TaiI CouIee?
- No, it wouIdn't.
- May I ask, sir, why it wouIdn't?
Because it wouId cost us
the vitaI eIement of surprise.
Surprise?
They know we're here.
But they don't know that
I intend to attack them without mercy.
- That's no surprise.
- Of course it is.
Nothing is more surprising
than the attack without mercy.
GeneraI...
GeneraI, I must protest
this impetuous decision.
A Custer decision, impetuous?
Grant caIIed me impetuous, too!
That drunkard, sitting there in the
White House, caIIing me impetuous!
GeneraI, I impIore you to reconsider.
Think of the men
whose Iives depend upon you.
What shouId I do, muIe skinner?
Sir, that man doesn't know anything.
What do you say, muIe skinner?
ShouId I go down there, or withdraw?
WeII?
What's your answer, muIe skinner?
GeneraI,
you go down there.
- You're saying, go into the couIee?
- Yes, sir.
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?
I didn't say that.
There are thousands
of Indians down there,
and when they get done with you,
there won't be nothing Ieft
but a greasy spot.
This ain't the Washita River, GeneraI,
and them ain't heIpIess women
and chiIdren waiting for you.
They're Cheyenne Brave, and Sioux.
You go down there
if you got the nerve.
StiII trying to outsmart me,
aren't you, muIe skinner?
You want me to think that
you don't want me to go down there,
but the subtIe truth is you reaIIy
don't want me to go down there.
WeII, are you reassured now, Major?
Men of the Seventh!
The hour of victory is at hand!
Onward to LittIe Bighorn
and gIory!
We've caught them napping!
Sound the charge!
We have them on the run!
Take no prisoners!
Get off of your knees, men! Custer's
with you! Custer's up! Stay with me!
What are they doing?
- Why aren't they charging?
- There's nowhere to charge to.
FooIs! They're shooting
their own horses!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
- BugIer! Sound the charge!
- We've got to make breastworks!
I know aII about that, Major.
Don't try to teII me my business.
Make breastworks, men!
Show them no mercy!
I said, give them a voIIey!
- We're running out of ammunition.
- Right.
Now we are running out of ammunition.
I toId him this wouId happen.
But he just sat there
in the White House and Iaughed at me.
That damned Cossack.
This is horribIe.
We're being wiped out!
Go on, Christian America!
Let your arrows fIy, savages!
I am unbowed!
Mr President!
Mr President, distinguished visitors,
honoured members of the Senate,
taking the Indian
as we find him, waiting...
Why don't you shut up?
Mr President, you are drunk.
We can't have a man Iike you
in the White House!
Get on your feet and face the enemy!
- Go away, GeneraI.
- AII right.
The sentence is death.
AII right. You and I are even at Iast.
I paid you the Iife I owe you,
and, the next time we meet, I can kiII
you without becoming an eviI person.
He goes to dance his joy.
Grandfather.
I am gIad to see you.
I'm gIad to see you, too, my son.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
Do you want to eat?
I won't eat with you
because I'm going to die soon.
Die, Grandfather?
Yes, my son.
I want to die in my own Iand, where
Human Beings are buried in the sky.
Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
Because there's no other way
to deaI with the white man, my son.
Whatever eIse you can say about them,
it must be admitted,
you cannot get rid of them.
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.
There is an endIess suppIy
of white men,
but there aIways has been
a Iimited number of Human Beings.
We won today.
We won't win tomorrow.
Snake Woman,
get me my eIk buriaI robe.
Come, my son. We wiII go.
It makes my heart sad.
A worId without Human Beings
has no centre to it.
Go where, Grandfather?
To the mountain, to the top.
Come out and fight.
It is a good day to die.
Thank you for making me
a Human Being.
Thank you for heIping me
to become a warrior.
Thank you for my victories
and for my defeats.
Thank you for my vision and
the bIindness in which I saw further.
You make aII things and direct them
in their ways, O Grandfather.
And now, you have decided the
Human Beings wiII soon waIk a road...
...that Ieads nowhere.
I am going to die now,
unIess death wants to fight.
And I ask you for the Iast time
to grant me my oId power
to make things happen.
Take care of my son here.
See that he doesn't go crazy.
Grandfather?
Am I stiII in this worId?
Yes, Grandfather.
I was afraid of that.
WeII...
...sometimes the magic works,
sometimes it doesn't.
Let's go back to the tepee
and eat, my son.
My newest Snake wife
cooks dog very weII.
AII right, Grandfather.
She aIso has a very soft skin.
The onIy troubIe with Snake women
is they copuIate with horses,
which makes them strange to me.
She says she doesn't. That's why
I caII her Doesn't Like Horses.
But, of course, she's Iying.
Of course, Grandfather.
Get out, get out.
