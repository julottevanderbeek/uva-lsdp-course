Aah-ee-aah-ee-aah!
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah!
Uhhh...
Ohhh...
You're...
From Baker?
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.
Tell him I want to live
in peace, understand?
There is no use to go on
tormenting me!
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.
Now that gold has disappeared,
but if he'd listened...
we could've avoided this
altogether.
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.
They couldn't uncover any more.
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.
Go back and tell him that.
Word's around you had a visitor.
And Baker knows it.
Name of Jackson.
Well...
Jackson was here...
or Baker's got it all wrong.
He's not wrong.
Maybe Baker
would like to know...
just what you and Jackson
had to say about the cash box.
That's not
what I'm being paid for.
I'm only interested
in what name...
Jackson's hiding under now.
Why do you think Jackson
may be assuming another name?
I would've found him already.
When I start off
to find somebody...
I find him.
That's why they pay me.
Ah.
What is Baker paying you?
That your family?
Yes.
Ha ha.
Nice family.
What does he pay you
for murdering me?
Heh heh heh.
Five hundred dollars...
to get the name.
The name.
Carson.
Bill Carson.
That's what
he calls himself now.
That's a lot of money... 1,000.
One thousand dollars?
And some in gold.
That's a tidy sum.
Huh.
But when I'm paid...
I always see the job through.
Ohhh...
Oh! It's you.
Any information?
Too much.
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.
And one or two things
that interested me.
Such as?
The name Jackson's
hiding under is...
Bill Carson.
Ah.
That's your bit.
Keep talking.
He also mentioned something...
about a certain, uh...
cash box...
which just happened
to disappear.
That's my bit.
Anything else?
Not enough for you, eh?
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything
to anybody again.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, perfect.
Here. Here you are.
Here. This is for you.
You did a good job for me...
worth 500 dollars.
Yeah. I almost forgot.
He gave me 1,000.
I think his idea
was that I kill you.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ah... ha Ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
But you know...
the pity is, when I'm paid...
I always follow my job through.
You know that.
No! Angel Eye...
Ha ha ha ha ha.
No. No pistol, amigo.
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.
Hey, amigo...
You know you got a face...
beautiful enough
to be worth $2,000?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Yeah...
But you don't look like
the one...
who'll collect it.
A couple steps back.
Ha ha. Thank you.
How much are you worth now?
How much?
Two thousand dollars.
That's right...
Two thousand dollars.
Yeah, $2,000.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Not bad.
Ha ha ha ha ha...
You'll pay for this!
I hope you end up
in a graveyard...
with the cholera
and the rabies and the plague!
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard!
Put me down!
I hope your mother ends up...
in a $2.00 whorehouse!
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose!
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
Let me go!
I think I feel sick.
The blood is bursting...
through my...
I'm dry, Blondie.
Oh... oh...
Agua.
Water.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha...
You slime!
You son of a bitch!
Let me go!
You're brave with
a man who's tied up!
Come back!
Aah, come back and fight...
You...
You bastard!
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in,
another comes out.
Cut it out!
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...
So you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?
Me?
Yeah, it's you.
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.
Yeah, roll it up!
Roll it up!
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.
To hell with all you
sheriffs and deputies...
and all who gave birth to you!
Hey, everybody, look, look!
He's giving him
the filthy money!
Judas! You sold my hide!
But you won't enjoy
that money...
not a penny.
If there's justice
in the world...
that money will go
to the undertakers...
every penny of it!
You know who you are?
You want to know
whose son you are?
You don't. I do.
Everybody does.
You're the son
of 1,000 fathers...
all bastards like you.
And your mother...
Ha! Your mother...
she's... You bastard!
Your mother... it's better
not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

and, contrary to the laws
of this state...
the condemned is guilty...
of using marked cards
and loaded dice.
Therefore, according
to the powers vested in us...
we sentence the accused
here before us...
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...
known as "The Rat..."
and any other aliases
he might have...
to hang by the neck until dead.
May God have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.
Unh!
Five for you...
One, two...
three, four... five for me.
Five for you...
and five for me.
Know how much you're worth now?
No. How much?
Three thousand dollars.
Ah. Ha ha.
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend.
Those with a rope
around their neck...
and the people who have the job
of doing the cutting.
Listen, the neck at the end
of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.
So the next time,
I want more than half.
You may run the risks,
my friend, but...
I do the cutting.
If we cut down my percentage...
Cigar?
Liable to interfere with my aim.
Mmm.
But if you miss...
you had better miss very well.
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive...
he understands nothing
about Tuco.
Ha ha ha ha!
Nothing.
JUDGE: Wanted in 15 counties
of this state.
The condemned,
standing before us...
sitting before us...
Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...
has been found guilty...
by the Third District
Circuit Court...
of the following crimes...
murder...
assaulting
a justice of the peace...
raping a virgin
of the white race...
statutory rape...
of a minor of the black race...
derailing a train...
in order to rob
the passengers...
in order to rob
the passengers...
Hey! Angel Eyes!
JUDGE: Highway robbery...
robbing an unknown number
of post offices...
What'd you find out, Shorty?
If you ask me,
seems like a book...
an armed unit escorting
a cash box of gold coins...
meets a yankee ambush...
and only three of them
are saved...
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.
The thing that wasn't saved,
though, was the coins.
But then the army
decides, of course...
to hold a hearing...
and Jackson's acquitted.
He disappears
and becomes Bill Carson.
I know his name.
Well, you don't know...
just who you're
looking for, and I do.
And when he's found...
I'd be scared to be
put in his shoes.
Where is Carson?
All I know
is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.
He lives with a girl called
Maria, who'll tell you.
She's a fresh young whore
in the territory.
Where's she?
Now, what's the name
of that town?
Someplace fairly near.
Santa Ana.
Adiós...
half-soldier.
JUDGE: Detention
And selling fugitive slaves...
burning down...
Luke, hand me down a whiskey.
JUDGE: And the sheriff's office
in Sonora.
The condemned hired himself
out as guide to a wagon train.
After receiving his payment
in advance...
he deserted the wagon train...
on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux Indians.
Glad they got him...
a man guilty
of all those crimes.
People with ropes
around their necks...
don't always hang.
What do you mean?
JUDGE: The condemned
is also guilty of...
Even a filthy beggar
like that...
has got a protecting angel.
...and misrepresenting
himself...
as a Mexican general.
A golden-haired angel
watches over him.
...from the Union army.
For all these crimes...
the accused has made
a full spontaneous confession.
The accused has made
a full spontaneous confession.
Therefore, we condemn him...
to be hung by the neck
until dead.
May the Lord have mercy
on his soul.
Proceed.
Aah!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Go, go, go, amigo
Go, go, go, amigo
Go, go, amigo
Go, go, go
TUCO: What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot.
Nobody misses...
when I'm at the end
of the rope.
You've never had a rope
around your neck.
Well, I'm going to
tell you something.
When that rope
starts to pull tight...
you can feel the devil
bite your ass.
Yeah, you're right.
It's getting tougher.
The way I figure...
there's really
not too much future...
with a sawed-off runt
like you.
What do you mean?
'Cause I don't think
you'll ever be worth...
more than $3,000.
What do you mean?
I mean our partnership
is untied.
Oh, no. Not you.
You remain tied.
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.
You filthy,
double-crossing bastard!
Of all the stinking,
dirty trick...
The way back to town
is only 70 miles.
If you save your breath...
I feel a man like you
could manage it.
Adiós.
You... you... you filthy bastard!
Come here!
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse!
Get off that horse,
you filthy coward!
If I ever catch you, Blondie...
I'll rip your heart out
and eat it.
I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you by your thumbs!
You pig! You vulture!
L... l... I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! Aah!
I'll kill you! Aah!
Such ingratitude...
after all the times
I've saved your life.
Where are you going?
This is only a trick!
You wouldn't leave me here!
Come back!
Wait! Blondie!
Listen, Blondie!
Ha ha!
I believe madam is home.
Ha ha ha!
Sweet dreams and many thanks...
from the second cavalry!
Hoorah! Hoorah!
Ha ha ha! Hoorah!
You filthy rats!
Maria?
Honey.
Is that you, Bill?
Bill!
Aah!
Who are you?
What do you want with me?
Go on talking about
Bill Carson.
I don't know him.
You were calling to him
in the dark.
Uhh!
Where is he?
What are you
going to do to him?
I'll ask the questions.
Where is he?
Aah!
Unh! Unh!
Where?
Where?
Where?
Where?
That's enough!
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago...
and went away with his unit.
They all left.
Which company?
Where'd they go.
Hmm?
Third cavalry.
General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.
That's all I know.
I swear!
Unh!
Ohhh...
Uhh!
But... but...
I'm very sorry,
but the store's closing.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
Heh heh.
Heh heh heh!
Hey?
Hmm?
Mmm...
Hmm.
Ooh, shh...
Revolvers.
Yeah, revolvers.
Ahhhh...
Oh!
Revolvers!
Well... here...
Here's where I keep
the best ones.
Here.
Remington.
Colt.
A Roat.
And a Smith-Wesson.
Colt... Navy.
Joslyn.
Another Remington.
And this one is...
that's enough.
Cartridges.
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.
Let's go.
Mm-mmm.
Move.
Move.
Ah.
Uh...
Heh heh heh heh.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Cartridge.
Mmm.
How much?
Twenty dollars.
Ha ha ha ha!
No.
Fifty dollars.
How much?
One hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
It's all I've got.
Here.
Hmm.
Come here.
Ahhh.
Ahhh.
Ha ha ha ha.
Huh?
Mm-hmm.
This morning,
I heard the whole thing.
They say Colonel Canby's
closing in...
with his Northerners...
and no later than tomorrow...
that they'll be in the city.
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.
You see,
as soon as these cowards...
hear a blue shirt's
around, they run.
These rebels
have no will to fight.
Poor things.
They'll soon be finished.
We get rid of these bastards...
then we begin making
money on those yankees.
They carry gold,
not paper dollars.
And they're going
to beat the South.
Look. See that one
with the white beard...
sitting in the wagon?
General Sibley.
He looks dead.
He's finally
getting out of our hair.
Hooray for Dixie! Hooray!
Hooray for Dixie!
Where's the owner of that horse?
Please, mister, sir,
a bad heart...
Where?
The war has frightened me
already.
I'm looking for
the owner of that horse.
He's tall, blond,
he smokes a cigar...
and he's a pig.
Where is he now?
You leave him be.
He doesn't know
who rides every horse.
You stay quiet, old hen.
U-upstairs.
Upstairs in room four, señor.
Hear that?
You rotten criminals.
How dare you?
Shh!
Aah!
Aah!
Ohhh...
Unh...
Unh...
Your spurs.
Heh heh heh heh heh.
There are two kinds
of spurs, my friend...
those that come in
by the door...
those that come in
by the window.
Take off that pistol belt.
It's empty.
Mine isn't.
Even when Judas
hanged himself...
there was a storm, too.
That could be cannon fire.
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.
You ever see this before,
my friend?
Throw it over the roof beam.
That's it.
Now get on that.
That's right.
Now make sure the rope is tight.
It's got to hold
the weight of a pig.
Now put the rope
around your neck.
That's very good.
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We'll fix that right away.
I have another system...
a little different than yours.
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool.
Adiós.

Move. Come on. Let's go.
Ah. Ha ha.
I don't know.
As soon as I hit the desert,
I'm thirsty.
Burns, huh?
They say people
with fair skin...
can't take too much.
Like that...
you won't have
to carry so much.
Ha ha ha ha.
Where are we going?
Where?
Where I'm going, amigo.
Over that way...
another 100 miles...
of beautiful sun-baked sand.
Even the armies are afraid...
to march through there.
Sibley's men
are retreating up there.
Canby's men are coming here.
But no one...
will set foot in this hell...
except you...
and me.
One hundred miles.
That's a nice walk.
Uh...
What was it you told me
the last time?
"If you save your breath...
"I feel a man like you
could manage it."
Ha ha ha ha.
And if you won't manage it...
you'll die...
only slowly.
Very slowly, old friend.
After you, please.
Start walking.
Taking a rest?
Come on, Blondie.
We don't have very far to go...
only 70 miles.
Only 81/2 hours more
before sunset.
That's not too bad.
Come on.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Whoa.
And so, Blondie...
It's good-bye.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, boy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Atta boy.
Ahh, that's nice.
Hmm.
Ah... ah...
Ah... ah...
Water...
Water.
Two hundred thousand
in gold.
It's yours.
Just get me water.
Uh-huh.
What's that you say?
Who the hell are you?
Carson...
My name is Bill Carson now.
It's Carson.
Surprise attack.
All dead.
My name is Jackson.
Huh?
Carson.
Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What was that you said
about the dollars?
Two hundred thousand.
All mine.
It was the Third Cavalry's.
Baker has nothing...
The gold.
I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.
Where?
Where... here?
Here?
Talk.
Huh?
The... cemetery.
Which cemetery?
The one...
on Sad Hill.
There's a grave by...
Which grave?
Have a name?
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy...
talk!
Huh?
There's no number.
There's a name.
Huh?
It's written...
It is?
Huh?
W-water...
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.
Sad Hill Cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.
But it must have a name
or a number on it!
There must be a thousand...
five thousand!
Water...
Don't die, huh?
Don't die.
I'll get you water.
Stay there.
Don't move.
I'll get you water.
Don't die until later,
you son of a...
Oh...
Aah!
Get away from there!
Uhh!
He's dead.
Yeah.
I'll kill you.
If... if you do that...
you'll always be poor...
just like the greasy rat
that you are.
If I were you...
I'd... keep me alive.
What did he tell you?
Huh?
A name.
Huh?
A name on a grave.
What name?
Blondie...
don't die.
Blondie...
don't die.
I'm your friend.
Please don't die! Please!
I'm your friend.
Come on, eh?
Come on!
Blondie? Heh heh.
I'll help you.
Dont move, I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.
Don't die like that pig.
Here, Blondie.
Here's water.
Water, Blondie.
Don't drink! No good for you.
Feel better?
Blondie?
What's the matter?
Please don't die!
Whoa!
Got a very sick man here.
But we have no more beds.
Let him have yours.
Where's Pablo Ramirez?
Padre Ramirez.
He's away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.
Well, it doesn't matter.
For the moment...
we take very good care
of my friend.
And may God be praised.
In case you didn't know it...
God is on our side, too...
because he hates the yanks.
Huh, Blondie?
Father, is he still breathing?
Yes, of course.
You're heavy.
There.
All right.
Put a fresh bandage on him.
Put him in my cell.
Easy!
Out, soldier.
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.
Oh!
Hey, Father, l...
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?
Father...
Father...
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak
about anything, Father?
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken
as yet...
but you mustn't worry.
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him
going until now.
He should regain his strength...
in a very short time.
Thank you, Father, thank you.
You don't know how much
this boy's life means to me.
Thanks be to Jesus.
Thanks to all of you.
Blondie?
Hey, Blon...
Blondie?
Oh.
Hey. Heh heh heh heh.
The old Father tells me...
you'll be up and around
in a few days.
You're very lucky...
to have me so close
when it happened.
Think if you'd been
on your own...
Look, I mean when...
when one is, uh... ill...
it's good to have
somebody close by...
friends or relations.
Do you...
Do you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?
Not even a mother.
No one.
You're all alone, huh?
Like me, Blondie.
We're all alone in the world.
I have you. You have me.
Only for a little while,
I mean.
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick
of fate.
We could have
all that money...
in our hands... now.
I...
I must tell you
the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would
do the same thing.
It's all over for you now.
There's nothing
anyone can do anymore.
Oh, God, look at me.
It's my fault. Mine.
Mine. Mine. Mine.
I'll tell you one thing,
Blondie.
If I knew that
my last hour had come...
I swear, in my place...
in your place...
I would do the same thing.
I would tell about the gold.
Yes. Yes, I would.
I'd tell the name on the grave.
After all, what good
is the money to you...
if you're dead?
I know the name
of the cemetery...
but you know how many
graves there are there?
Please...
Blondie...
Please, have a little.
Here.
Here... coffee.
Please, tell me the name.
On...
on the grave.
If I get my hands
on the $200,000...
I'll always honor your memory.
I swear.
I'll always honor your memory.
I'll...
Come... closer.
Tell... tell me.
You dirty...
I'll sleep better...
knowing my good friend
is by my side...
to protect me.
"Tuco, water." Here's water...
but if I get that name
from you...
I'll give you water.
All right, you dirty skunk...
get your ass off the bed.
Come on, come on,
the party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.
From the way the wounded...
are pouring into this place...
we'd better get
the hell out of here...
before we get caught up
in the war.
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
There's something
I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute.
Get moving.
Where? This way?
Yes.
Hey.
Hey, Pablo?
Hey...
Hey.
Don't you recognize me?
Heh heh heh heh. It's me!
It's Tuco!
Let me embrace you!
Oh... ooh.
L... I don't know
the right thing.
I was just passing by here.
I said to myself...
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother?"
Did I do wrong?
It doesn't matter.
I'm very happy.
You have seen me, Tuco.
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm very glad I came.
Uh...
Oh, my uniform!
It's a long story.
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.
You look very well.
Hmm, a bit thin perhaps, but...
Ha ha ha ha!
You were always thin,
eh, Pablito?
Well...
What about our parents?
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.
Nine years?
So, it's nine years.
Ha ha ha ha!
Nine years!
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.
Our father died
only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.
He asked for you to be there.
But there was only me.
And you?
Outside of evil...
what else
have you managed to do?
It seems to me...
you once had a wife someplace.
Not one. Lots of them.
One here. One there.
Wherever I found them.
Go on.
Preach me a sermon, Pablo.
What good would that be?
Just keep on
the way you're going.
Go away.
And the Lord have mercy
on your soul.
Sure, I'll go.
And while I'm waiting...
for the Lord
to remember me...
I, Tuco Ramirez...
brother of Brother Ramirez...
will tell you something.
You think you're better
than I am.
Where we came from...
if one did not want
to die of poverty...
one became a priest or a bandit.
You chose your way.
I chose mine.
Mine was harder!
You talk about
Mother and Father.
You remember, when you left
to become a priest...
I stayed behind.
I must have been 10, 12...
I don't remember which...
but I stayed.
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I will tell you something.
You became a priest...
because you were too much
of a coward to do what I do.
Ugh!
Tuco.
Please forgive me, brother.
Hyah.
Ah, my belly's full.
Nice guy, my brother.
I didn't tell you...
my brother was in charge here?
Everything.
Like the pope almost.
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah, yeah, my brother...
he say to me, "Stay, brother.
"Don't go home.
"We never see each other.
"Here there's plenty
to eat and drink.
"Bring your friend, too."
Whenever we see each other...
he never lets me go.
It's always the same story.
My brother...
he is crazy about me.
That's so.
Even a tramp like me...
no matter what happens...
I know there's
a brother somewhere...
who will never refuse me
a bowl of soup.
Sure.
Well, after a meal...
there's nothing like
a good cigar.
Whoa.
Look.
Whoa.
Hey, wake up, you.
The troops are coming.
Blue or gray?
Huh?
They're gray like us.
Let's say hello to them
and then get going.
Hoorah!
Hoorah for the Confederacy!
Hoorah!
Down with General Grant!
Hoorah for General...
What's his name?
Lee.
Lee. Lee!
Hey, God is with us...
because he hates the yanks, too!
Hoorah!
God's not on our side...
'cause he hates idiots also.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four...
Prisoners of war...
forward!
March!
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four...
Halt!
Left...

Form a single file.
Move!
Jonathan Ross.
Present.
Richard Bouvier.

Nathaniel Solomon.
Present.
Robert Clark.

Sam Richman.
Sam Richman.
Present.
Bill Carson.
Bill Carson?
I said Bill Carson!
Hey, Blondie.
Isn't that Angel Eyes?
All right,
what's he doing... sleeping?
Bill Carson!
Yeah. And you better be
Bill Carson.
Bill Carson!
Yeah... yeah...
that's me.
Please, Carson...
answer "present."
Hmm.
What are you, deaf?
Ugh!
Now suppose you say
"present," Carson.
I like big fat men like you.
When they fall,
they make more noise.
And sometimes they never get up.
Wallace...
That's enough.
Sergeant!
The captain wants
to see you right away.
Be sure these two get
good treatment.
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.
Yeah.
For the last time, sergeant...
For the last time, sergeant...
I'm telling you
I want the prisoners...
treated as prisoners.
No more brutality.
There's hundreds of prisoners
out there...
and only a few men
to guard them.
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.
I think that you'll manage
to gain their respect...
by treating them better.
Are our men treated that well...
in Andersonville Camp?
I don't give a goddamn...
what they do in Andersonville.
While I'm in charge here...
the prisoners are
not to be tortured...
or cheated...
or murdered.
That an accusation?
Sergeant, gangrene
is eating my leg away...
not my eyes.
I know the prisoners here...
are being robbed systematically.
I know there's scum around...
who are bivouacked
near the camp...
waiting for someone
to deliver this loot.
But as long as
I'm commandant...
I won't permit
any such trickery.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir...
just as long as
you're the commandant.
Yes, sergeant.
I know this leg means
I won't last very long...
but I pray I can manage
to have enough time...
to amass evidence...
and bring to a court-martial...
all those
who discredit and dishonor...
the uniform of the Union.
I wish you luck.
You and the others...
better lay low for a few days.
No, I'll keep this.
You go.
Wallace will let you know.
Wallace...
bring me Carson.
Right.
Listen, Angel Eyes said...
for us to lay low
for a few days.
But we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.
Come on, saddle your horses.
Get in.
Get in.
Huh?
Come on in, Tuco.
Don't be bashful.
There's no formalities here.
It's been a long time.
You're hungry.
Sit down. Eat.
Heh, I knew it, I knew it.
The minute I saw you,
I said to myself...
"Look at that pig Angel Eyes.
"I'll bet he got himself
an easy job.
"And he never forgets a friend."
I never forget
old friends, Tuco.
Uh, right.
It's good to see
old friends again.
Good.
Especially when they've come...
from so far away.
We have so much to talk about.
Mm-hmm.
And you do have
a lot to talk about...
haven't you?
You were captured near, uh...
Fort Craig.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, if you were with Sibley...
that means then that you, uh...
were coming from Santa Fe.
Mm-hmm.
Was it hard crossing the desert?
Mm-hmm.
Very hard.
Especially if you don't
have anything to drink.
Why are you going
under the name...
of Bill Carson now?
One name is as good as another.
Not wise to use your own name.
Like you!
I'll bet they don't
call you Angel Eyes.
Ha ha. Sergeant Angel Eyes.
Like a little music
with your meal, Tuco?
Music?
Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.
So...
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
Hmm.
That fake, too?
Bill Carson's name's
written on it.
Have some.
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
Aah!
Aagghh-aagghh.
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?
What'd he tell you
about the money?
I...
don't...
I... I don't know...
what you're talking about.
Aah!
More feeling.
You can sure
consider yourself...
much luckier than your pal.
Wallace will punch
your friend...
as long as the song goes.
So many of us have had
a session in there.
Ohh.
Ohh.
How's your digestion now?
You'd better talk.
I have nothing to tell you.
Aah!
Play that fiddle, you.
A-aaah!
Aah-aahh!
I...
I ta... I talk.
What did he say
about the money?
It's b...
It's b...
It's... buried in a grave.
Where?
Sad Hill...
Sad Hill...
Sad Hill Cemetery.
Which grave?
I d... I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.
Blondie...
Ask... Blondie.
He knows...
the name of the grave.
Blondie...
Blondie.
Blondie.
The war's over for you.
Put those clothes on.
Why?
We're going for a ride.
Where?
To find $200,000.
I know the name
of the cemetery now...
and you know
the name of the grave.
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?
Would you talk?
No.
Probably not.
That's what I thought.
Not that you're
any tougher than Tuco...
but you're smart enough...
to know that talking
won't save you.
And Tuco...
is he...
Mm-mmm.
No.
Not yet.
But he's in very good hands.
You've changed partners...
but you still got
the same deal.
I'm not greedy.
I'm only taking half.
There's two of us.
It should make it easier
than just one.
Yeah.
Hold it.
That's it.
Don't move.
Now don't breathe.
Still... that's it.
Ahh...
Got it.
Thank you.
Hey, corporal,
afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?
To hell, with a rope
around his neck...
and a price on his head.
Yeah. Three thousand dollars,
friend.
That's a lot of money
for a head.
I'll bet they didn't even...
pay you a penny for your arm.
I told you once, friend...
if I ever get you down...
you're gonna need a lot
of help to get up again.
You're a lot luckier
than that one there.
You'll get
some proper rope...
and you're all finished.
And there isn't any partner
this time to shoot you down.
Get up.
Sure would like to put
your paw on it, huh?
I would like to piss.
It's rough.
I've been shaken up
on this train...
nearly ten hours now.
You smell like a pig already...
but let's try not
to make things any worse.
Get going.
I can't
while you're watching me.
Aah!
You made a lot of noise,
my friend, huh?
You don't want to break
our friendship, huh?
Well, I'll break it.
Halt.
Take your places.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Slim, take care of the horses.
Hmm. I been looking for you
for eight months.
Whenever I should've had
a gun in my right hand...
I thought of you.
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.
When you have to shoot, shoot.
Don't talk.
Every gun makes its own tune.
And it's perfect timing,
large one.
Clem.
Follow him.
Tsk tsk tsk.
Hey... oop!
Hey... oop!
Just a minute.
I'll be right there.
Just give me a little time...
to get dressed,
and I'll open up.
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.
Hey...
Hey... Hey, Blondie.
How the hell did you
get out of that pigsty?
My own way.
I'm here
with your old friend Angel Eyes.
You talked, you traitor.
You talked.
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably
wouldn't be here now.
You...
mean...
so only you know...
your half of the secret?
Mm-hmm.
Ahh... ha ha ha, Blondie!
I'm very happy...
you're working with me...
and we're together again.
I get dressed, I kill him...
and be right back.
Oh, listen, uh...
I forgot to mention...
uh, he's not alone.
There's five of them.
Five?
Yeah, five of them.
So that's why you came to Tuco?
It doesn't matter.
I'll kill them all.
They shot him at close range.
Well, look who's here.
The other one will be along.
They'll come looking for us.
Watch out.
There's two of them.
I want that blond alive.
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.
Were you gonna die alone?
Halt!
Hey, Blondie...
Angel Eyes is mine, huh?
All right.
Ah...
"See you soon...
"i-idi..."
"idiots."
It's for you.
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
Like a cemetery, for instance?
Hey...
there should be a bridge
across that river.
We'd better wait
for nightfall.
Trust in me, Blondie.
Ha ha. Ha ha. I...
l... I got a good sense
of where I'm going.
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way...
Gentlemen.
Tell the captain.
Yes, sir.
Come along now.
Follow me.
We found them
near the perimeter, sir.
Where do you hail from?
Illinois.
And you?
I...
I'm with him.
Any reason
for being around here?
Uhh... we... we want
to enlist, general.
You better learn
to distinguish rank.
I'm a captain.
Get the hell out.
It sure as hell
might be you today...
so go write your will.
Yes, sir.
So you want to enlist?
You got to take a test
to prove it.
Well, show me.
Hey...
Ha ha ha.
You've got a career.
At the least,
I'd say you'll make colonel.
Really?
Sure. Ha ha ha ha.
Like it says in the manual...
"You've got every qualification
"to become an expert
in the use of weapons."
For this, sir...
is the most potent weapon
in war.
The fighting spirit's
in this bottle.
Volunteers.
You want to enlist, hmm?
Let's go.
Come on, gentlemen, come on.
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're still in time.
Yes, because soon
you can join...
the gallant heroes
of Branston Bridge.
Ha ha ha.
We have two attacks a day.
Two attacks a day?
Sure.
The rebs have decided
that damn bridge...
is the key to this whole area.
Stupid, useless bridge.
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
And headquarters has declared...
we must take that
ridiculous flyspeck...
even if all of us are killed.
Otherwise,
the key will get rusty...
and just be a spot on the wall.
Heh heh heh heh.
And that's not all.
Both sides
want the bridge intact.
Intact
is how the South wants it.
And we want it intact, too.
You'll all turn to dust...
but one thing is sure, boys.
The Branston Bridge
will stand unbroken.
Is it bad...
to speak the way I do
to volunteers?
Hmm.
Hmm?
I've done a lot worse.
I've done it,
I've blown it up... boom!
In here...
I've destroyed it all.
It's a court-martial
offense to imagine...
to dream of blowing it up.
A serious crime.
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...
Why not really blow it up,
captain?
Yeah, captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare
the hell out of them.
I've been dreaming about it.
I've even worked out a plan.
Uh-huh. Ha ha.
I sure have.
The best time...
is after the attack...
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.
If I could do it...
I could save
many thousands of men.
But what I lack is the guts.
They're beginning
their daily slaughter...
right on time.
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.
Huh. Be right there.
Let's go.
All right, friends...
come along
and enjoy the spectacle.
Companies!
Report!
Company B ready!
Company E ready!
Company D ready!
Companies!
Forward!
Hey, Blondie!
Looks like the captain's
really asking...
for a bullet in his guts.
Yeah.
Never seen so many men
wasted so badly.
I have a feeling...
it's really going to be
a good long battle.
Blondie...
Huh?
The money's on the other
side of the river.
Oh?
Where?
Ahh ha ha!
Amigo, I said the other side...
and that's enough.
But while the confederates
are there...
we can't get across.
What would happen...
if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?
Yeah...
then these idiots would
go somewhere else to fight.
Maybe.
Oh-ho.
MAN: Doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded.
Hurry, a stretcher.
Easy, easy now.
Ohh!
Get things ready.
A little of this will help.
Take a slug of this, captain.
Keep your ears open.
MAN: Ohh!
What are you doing?
No, leave me alone.
Ohh, ohh, ohh.
Blondie, hey...
You realize we might be
risking our lives?
Yeah, and if I get killed...
you'll never get your hands...
on all that beautiful money.
Huh?
Yeah, Tuco...
it sure would be a pity.
Hey...
Doc...
Doctor...
Could you help me
live a little more?
I expect good news.
Ahh...
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?
Why don't we?
Huh? Huh?
You go first.
No, I think it's better
that, uh...
you start.
All right.
The name of the cemetery is...
Sad Hill.
Now it's your turn.
Uh-huh.
The name on the grave is...
Arch Stanton.
Ar... Ar... Arch Stanton?
Are you sure?
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.
Aah.
Hah! Hyah!
Lt'll be a lot easier
with that.
Two can dig a lot quicker
than one.
Dig.
You're not digging.
If you shoot me...
you won't see a cent
of that money.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause there's nothing in there.
Why, you son of a...
You thought I'd trust you?
Two hundred thousand dollars
is a lot of money.
We're going to have to earn it.
How?
I'll write the name...
on the bottom of this stone.
The gun...
Ohh!
Hey...
You pig!
You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?
Last night.
You see, in this world...
there's two kinds of people,
my friend...
those with loaded guns...
and those who dig.
You dig.
Where?
Here.
"Un-k... Un-K..."
There's no name on it.
There's no name here, either.
You see, that's what
Bill Carson told me.
It was the grave
marked "unknown..."
right beside Arch Stanton.
Huh?
Go ahead.
Ee-ee-eeh!
Blondie!
It's all ours, Blondie!
You're joking, Blondie.
You wouldn't play a joke
on me like that?
It's no joke.
It's a rope, Tuco.
Now, I want you
to stand up there...
and put your head in that noose.
Ohh-oh.
Well, now...
seems just like old times.
Four for you...
and four...
Four for me.
Uhh... hey, Uh...
Blon... Blon...
Bl-Blondie...
Sorry, Tuco.
Blon...
Blondie!
Blondie!
Blondie!
Blondie...
Blondie!
Blondie!
Unh...
Mmm...
Oh...
Son of a bitch.
Blondie...
Aah!
Hey, Blondie!
You know what you are?
Just a dirty son of a b...
