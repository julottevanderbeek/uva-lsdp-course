James!
She Iet you go then?
- Yeah.
-
Afraid of nobody.
I wish you couId see into my heart, James,
and know that, this very night...
- I am going to repent of aII my sins.
-
-
-
-
-
-  What's that?
-  They're Ieaving Harvard.
You're hungover.
James! James!
Where are we supposed to be?
Here?
My friends...
if it be not a mere farce -
If it be not a mere farce
you are enacting...
in these sacred vaIedictory rites...
- if you mean them, feeI them -
-
as I know you do...
they have for you a mandate
of imperative duty.
-  HaIIeIujah!
-
It is not great weaIth aIone...
that buiIds the Iibrary...
founds the coIIege...
that is to diffuse a high Iearning
and cuIture among a peopIe.
It is the contact...
of the cuItivated mind
with the uncuItivated.
If it be true...
that the constitution
ofAmerican society...
is pecuIiarIy hostiIe now...
to aII habits of thought
and meditation...
it doubIy behooves us -
It doubIy behooves us...
to Iook weII
to the influence we may exert.
A high ideaI -
the education of a nation.
CIass of '70...
friends, parents...
reIations of the cIass of '70...
I now introduce your cIass orator -
Mr. WiIIiam C. Irvine.
Oh!
James! Onward!
WiIIiam.
Give us a good one, BiII!
CIass of '70...
Iadies and gentIemen...
friends of the cIass of '70...
That's your friend.
There is a story
toId by an ancient author...
of a young man who being noticed
by his friend to Iook dejected...
was questioned by him...
concerning the cause
of his troubIed appearance.
The youth used no conceaIment...
but toId him that, for three days...
he had been vainIy endeavoring
with his utmost efforts...
to find an exordium for a subject
on which he had to write.
Whereupon,
his friend repIied with a smiIe...
"Do you wish to write
better than you can?"
"And such," says the oId author,
"is the whoIe truth of the matter.
We must endeavor to speak
to the best of our abiIity...
but we must speak
according to our abiIity."
Oh. He keeps Iooking at you.
And simiIar to the distress of this youth
was my own troubIe...
when upon examining the oId skeIeton
upon which most coIIege orations are hung -
I considered how I might incarnate
that famiIiar framework.
Of course, I at once decided
not to attempt any profound...
or difficuIt matter...
Iest having given the dry bones
at best but a Iong tongue -
puny strength.
And after much carefuI
and caIm meditation...
the cIass has refused to advise aIteration...
on the usuaI Iaw
that is caIIed gravitation.
Though we had thought at one time
of having it stopped...
in order that some of us
might not be dropped.
But the mind of mankind
perhaps wiII be gratified to Iearn...
that, at Iast, the Iaw has been ratified...
and the common resuIt
can be counted on stiII.
AII rivers, as usuaI, flowing downhiII.
The seasons, in turn,
wiII continue to roII.
We shaII ask for no change
in the north or south poIe.
The sun wiII continue to set in the west.
The majority of us considered it best.
We discIaim aII intention
of making a change...
in what...
we esteem...
on the whoIe...
I don't know where to Iook.
weII arranged.
-
-
-
- Oh!
James!
- Excuse me.
-
- God, you're beautifuI.
- So are you.
-
- Are you aIone?
Oh, yes.
Come on. Where is it?
Fuck you, bastards!
Let him through!
Let him through!
Fuck you bastards!
Come on, James!
Come on! Get him up!
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, you bastards!
You fucker!
Give me a push!
James! James! James!
You did it, James!
You got it, James! You got it!
...be forever
Let our Iove perish never
When we're parted, stick together
Heart to heart, boId and true
-  Never fear then for Seventy
- My God, BiIIy.
- Have you ever feIt ready to die?
-  Give a cheer then for Seventy
It's over!
-  Meet the worId braveIy, Seventy
- James, do you reaIize -
-  Forward hearts, boId and true
- It's over.
Three cheers for our dear oId country!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
Hooray!
-
-
Stupid.
Goddamn ignorant bastards.
Go back to where you came from!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Pardon me.
If I couId get by, pIease.
Thank you very much.
-
-
How are ya?
Try to keep moving, foIks. Thank you.
Try and keep moving, foIks.
Thank you very much.
Casper.
Let's move it. Move.
Move aIong, pIease.
That you, CuIIy?
Yes. Yes.
Howdy, Jim. Howdy.
WeII, I wiII be damned.
What in the heII
are you doing here in that rig?
There's hard times, Jim.
A citizen's got to make a doIIar
any way he can these days.
I thought you was stiII
up in Johnson County.
I am.
WeII, what are you doing down here, then,
in this part of the worId?
I brought an immigrant woman
in for hanging.
FederaI penitentiary, St. Louis.
Is the Iaw hanging women now, are they?
She shot her husband six times in the head
and then the kids.
God of shit.
Maybe I'm overdue
for a new Iife myseIf, CuIIy.
So - So how is things in St. Louis anyways?
The bank just crashed.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What's next?
Time to get out, CuIIy. Head west.
I aIready been there.
WeII, you got yourseIf
a-a fit drivin' carriage here.
Taking it back up to Johnson County,
are you?
Tonight, if it doesn't snow.
Say, another citizen was kiIIed up there
day before yesterday.
Caught speed butchering a steer
with a hatchet.
MichaeI - MichaeI Kovach, I beIieve it was.
Mike Kovach, you say?
I teII you,
every new citizen takes up Iand here...
the big feIIas bIackbaII him.
A citizen steaIs
to keep his famiIy from starving -
-
- and they-they threaten them off or kiII them.
- Goddamn.
- I'II teII you something, Jim.
I'II teII you something.
If the rich couId hire others
to do their dying for them...
the poor couId make a wonderfuI Iiving.
Money.
- The Arab horse is yours, too, I see.
WeII, that's a fine-Iooking animaI.
-
Take him on down to the stabIe.
It's getting more crowded
every day, isn't it?
Those poor sons of bitches sit around weeks
waiting for cIaims verifications.
Do they know
what's waiting for them out here?
No, they don't. They do not.
Theyjust sit here
in the asshoIe of creation...
some of them starving
right in front of my eyes.
Babies too.
Every damn day, I swear I'm not
gonna give 'em another penny.
I'm a poor citizen myseIf.
What can you do?
- I'm as human as the next citizen.
-
I'm a human being, ain't I?
I'm not ashamed of it.
I teII - I teII you, Jim.
I got so I can't stand this job aIready.
- There you go, CuIIy. It's on me this time.
- You don't have to do that, Jim.
What do you want
to go and do a thing Iike that for?
Harness up the Studebaker for me, wiII you?
I'II be back for it presentIy.
WeII, I - I'II put your grip in there for you.
Set this up there in that carriage.
I don't want to see a scratch on it.
Say, Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim! Watch yourseIf.
I mean take care of yourseIf.
Aw, I don't - I don't know what I mean.
Thanks, CuIIy.
Don't Iet these citizens get to you.
Yeah. You know that.
Show me that other Browning there.
WeII baIanced.
BiII, how you doin'?
DudIey, I do beIieve
I am finaIIy workin' for a rich firm.
-  George, we'II pick up the extra men.
-  How many hands has he got?
- He's got five dozen. I got -
- Hi. How you doin', George?
How many gun hands you -
- Association?
- Name's Morrison.
-
- Sign here.
I want a new suit of cIothes
and a Witte's SpeciaI 12-gauge shotgun.
Suits are over there at the seIf-service rack.
I'II get the other.
Association?
No. Where's ZindeI?
Died. ApopIexy.
WeII, you struck it rich here, friend.
Mister, I ain't got spit enough
to pass the time of day.
- What can I do for you?
- Winchester '66. Brandy - B&B.
I think I'II go with the other one.
I feeI Iike these immigrants
comin' in here these days are -
I think that's enough, friend.
I said you aIready won.
Says who, oId man?
I can't beIieve you fixed your mouth
to say that, boy.
- You peopIe go back where you came from.
-
Go back where you came from!
Hey, Jim!
What's going on here, CuIIy?
WeII, you hear a Iot of things
around a raiI depot, Jim.
Rumors mostIy.
Listen, I-I -
I can't aff -
I can't afford to get invoIved.
Damn it, I just got this job.
Whoa, boy.
Aw, heII.
I was over Iast night to the Sage HoteI
having meseIf some BaItimore oysters...
when I met up
with a coupIe of citizens there.
A Mr. Morrison and Mr. BudIey.
No, that ain't right. DudIey.
That's what it was. DudIey.
One of the biggest
damn citizens I ever seen...
with two eyes in his head Iike a dead fish.
WeII, I - I had a Iong drink
with this Morrison and DudIey...
and-and they said to me -
they said to me that they was -
they was currentIy in the empIoy
of the Stock Growers Association...
and that the Association was hiring up
a big mob from aII over the northwest.
WeII, every citizen's business is his own affair,
not mine, damn it.
I beIieve I'II pay the Association
a IittIe caII whiIe I'm here.
- Watch my goods, CuIIy.
- Right, Jim. Right.
DispIace us and our capitaI...
and 50 years must pass
before the earth can be made...
to produce the same weaIth
in any other form.
This is no Ionger a poor man's country.
These emigrants onIy pretend to be farmers.
But we know many of them personaIIy
to be thieves and anarchists...
openIy preying on our ranges.
No jury in Johnson County
wiII indict them...
even in the face of evidence as concIusive
as any ever offered in a court ofjustice.
Right.
Yeah, they're an ignorant,
degraded gang of paupers.
Their onIy stock-in-trade consists of
having Iarge numbers of ragged kids.
Out of 1 80 indictments,
we have had one conviction in four years.
That man was caught with the hide
and the bones of the stoIen animaI.
He was found guiIty of steaIing
the hide and the bones onIy...
which were vaIued at $1 8...
making his crime petty Iarceny.
The jury evidentIy took it for granted...
that the rest of the animaI
was stiII out roaming the range.
Unenforced Iaw
is an invitation to anarchy.
ConsequentIy,
the Stock Growers Association...
wiII now and pubIicIy
wipe out these thieves and anarchists.
We are empIoying 50 men
on the basis of five doIIars a day...
and $50 for every cattIe thief shot or hung.
-
-  Good idea.
We wiII go to Johnson County...
we wiII depose
the incompetent civiI authority there...
and we wiII keep possession of the town
untiI we can take charge of the courts.
- Good.
- Right.
We have pIaced 125 names on a death Iist.
-
-
I know that it is popuIar at present
to hamper justice for us.
But, gentIemen...
to kiII...
aII at one time?
Huh?
WeII, that wiII onIy further prejudice
pubIic opinion against ourseIves.
No. No.
So I'm going to move that we stop...
right here.
I had a very satisfactory taIk
with the governor yesterday.
He asserted in the most positive terms
his whoIehearted support...
as weII as that of the Senate
and the House of Representatives...
and the president of these United States.
If we faiI,
the flag of the United States faiIs.
That's aII I'm going to say
before we ask every one of you...
to express your approvaI
of the generaI pIan of campaign.
We'II caII the roII and take a voice vote.
-
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Stratton.
- Yes.
- Vaughn.
- Yes.
- HaII.
- Yes.
- Ward.
- Yes.
- Cummings.
- Most definiteIy.
- SteeI.

- HardIy.

- Weatherford.

MiIIer.
- Tower.
- Yes.
- King.
- Yes.
- Thompson.
- Yes.

HoIy God of the Prophets.
James.
HeIIo, BiIIy.
We've just been debating...
one of your county's
more infamous IegaI decisions.
IncidentaIIy, does anybody eIse
know that you're here?
Just you.
Why the heII did you come here?
WeII, why do we do anything, BiIIy?
"As we ask but time to drift...
drift and note the devious ways of man.
To drift...
and to scan the truths...
that underIie the surface faiths
whereby men Iive and die."
W.C. Irvine, Hasty Pudding.
BiIIy, you're the onIy son of a bitch I ever knew
worth getting seriousIy drunk with.
It's true.
Yes, that's true, you know.
James, you snookered yourseIf again.
Do you know, James...
one haIf of my drunkenness
can be accounted for...
by the fact that this buiIding
is so poorIy ventiIated.
Two raiIs, side pocket.
What's going on here, BiIIy?
UgIy rumors, James.
That's a gob of spit, BiIIy.
A hundred names...
or thereabouts.
- On a Iist.
-
Just some of these emigrants
that they're going to kiII off.
Even they can't get away
with a thing Iike that.
WeII...
in principIe...
everything can be done.
In principIe.
What'II you do, BiIIy?
I'm -
I'm a victim of our cIass, James.
- Good-bye, BiIIy.
- James.
Do you remember the...
good, gone days?
CIearer and better
every day I get oIder.
-  Hey.
-  What's he doing here?
You were bIackbaIIed
out of this cIub Iong ago, AveriII.
You're trespassing.
We couId have you shot here - IegaIIy.
LegaIIy, you bastards have a right
to protect your own property.
But unIess you got
a signed IegaI warrant...
for every name on that death Iist...
stay out of my county.
You offset every effort we make
to protect our property...
and that of members of your own cIass.
You're not in my cIass, Canton.
You never wiII be.
You'd have to die first and be born again.
-
- Frank! Frank!
- Watch yourseIf.
- You aII right, Frank?
- Frank. Frank, are you aII right?
- Pete, heIp me get him up.
- Let's heIp him up.
Get him up first, aII right?
-
- You okay?
- AII right! I'm aII right!
- Let's go.
-
What happened?
They came this way and kiIIed him.
WeII, what'II you do out here now?
Work our Iand.
Without a man?
He paid, uh, $1 50 for it.
We own it now.
I'II take you back.
I'II settIe this. I promise you that.
We'II work our Iand. Thank you.
WeII, good-bye then. And good Iuck.
Thank you.
WhoIe damn country wiII be nothing
but widows and orphans soon.
The Stock Growers Association is the Iargest
association of its kind in the worId.
We pIan to pubIicIy wipe out...
I stiII need
who want to make a Iot of money.
What's it pay?
We are empIoying on the basis
of five doIIars a day pIus expenses...
and $50 for every thief and anarchist
shot or hung.
Who's paying, mister?
You don't worry about that.
Who's paying?
I'm paying.
Stand aside here.
Son of a bitch.
Even the goddamn kids now.
I ain't kid.
I'm married man.
Get out of here before I bIow
your brains out, married man.
Don't do it, married man.
You're very Iucky you're not dead aIready.
- Just... take it easy now, mister, huh?
-
My famiIy starving. You know that.
That don't give you room to steaI.
You Iook Iike one of us.
You work for them?
I'II decide what I am.
I'm not going to kiII a kid
stiII pisses in his pants.
Now get on out of here.
Goddamn traitor!
-
- Ja.
- ...einem Dollar?
-  Ein Dollar.
Ein Dollar? Put it down.
- Pay attention, wiII you?
- Ja, ja.
- If you wanna do this job, do it right.
- Ja, ja.
I'II give a doIIar to twenty-five cents.
I'II give it one time.
You got it.

Get them back, WiIIy!
Top him! Top him!
Keep back, SchuItz! Keep back, SchuItz!
Keep him back, WiIIy!
- AII right. Is he hurt? Let me see, WiIIy.
-
- Speak EngIish.
- He's hurt.
I can see that. AII right.
That's it, baby.
-
- AII right. Now, keep his head wet.
- Get ready.
-
Stop pushing!
Morning, Jim.
So how's St. Louis?
Thank you.
That's a fine piece.
- How's business?
- Business? Good.
Ah, these peopIe. You know them.
Don't have but a pot to piss in.
But peopIe aIways get thirsty
after a funeraI.
And I'm not about to sit
and watch the grass grow...
when there's money to be made.
Yeah, weII, most of them
can't even afford a funeraI...
Iet aIone their wives and kids.
Get them aII the heII out of here
before church opens.
Association's decIared war, J.B.
They want to get rid of aII this.
Fifty doIIars for every citizen on the Iist
shot or hung.
TeII me when you want to get serious.
I am serious.
There's 125 names on a death Iist.
My God.
That's aImost everybody in the county.
How can peopIe decIare war
on a whoIe county?
I guess, on principIe,
everything can be done.
Goddamn.
It's getting dangerous
to be poor in this country.
Isn't it?
It aIways was.
Have you toId anybody eIse yet?
No, not yet.
No, Iet them have their Sunday.
Tomorrow morning wiII be time enough.
-
- Do you hear me? Idiot!
- I toId that bIack-bearded -

He put feet on my Iand one more time,

-  What happened to your head?
- Why don't you ask him something?
-
- AII right, goddamn it, shut up!
AII right, one of you teII me what's happening,
and the rest of you shut up.
PIease. Uh, pIease.
It's not me who is making compIaint.

- I kiII you! I kiII you!
He come to me and my wife,
and he using -
Very bad word before wife!
And he never, uh, stop,
Iisten what I have to say.
What did you have to say?
-
-
I say - I say, "I am truIy sorry,
but, uh, my property Iine crosses here."
I want that son of a bitch -
AIbert, you put off yeIIing in here!
Okay, then what happened?
What the heII difference
makes what happened?
He aIready admitting he's crossing my Iines.
He, uh, knock me down...
and, uh, I - I take him by foot...
and, uh, my wife hit him on head with rock.
-
- That's Iie! That's Iie!
That's Iie!
And, uh -
- I - I heId him and, uh...

so that he was there Iast time
when I see him untiI now.
That's another Iie!
That's -
Remember!
Out before church opens!
Good morning, Mr. AveriII.
Good morning, George, Mrs. EggIeston.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm. I missed you.
What the heII is that?
I didn't have any breakfast yet.
Is that aII that's stopping you?
Mmm! Come on.
Pie?
I think it's the best one I ever did.
It's beautifuI.
It beIongs in a museum.
- It's great.
-
- Mmm!
- It's deIicious.
Mmm! You eat the pie first.
It took me a whoIe day to make it for you,
so you eat aII of it.
TeII me something.
How do you manage
to take care of business...
and make pies at the same time?
Mmm.
HeIp me.
I brought your birthday present.
Yes? Yeah?
ReaIIy? It's very expensive, no?
What eIse have I got to spend my money on?
Where is it? Is it here?
Where is it?
TeII me, pIease.

Ahh!

No. I'II bring it out to you.
How do you Iike 'im?
It's so beautifuI.
Oh!
I can't stop crying.
I don't know what the heII

I feeI I finaIIy got somewhere.
- I'm so happy I couId bust.
- What's stopping you?
Whoo!
What the fuck is going on?
We just got to sIeep around here.
Howdy, NeII! Ladies.
You just drag your tired

Boy, you got everything

WeII, it ain't easy, Mr. AveriII.

Come on!
Do you have any idea

Come on, Bessie!
Watch out.
If you can -
If you can see dayIight

SIow down, EIIa.
- Turn off before you get to town.
I don't want anybody to see me.
- Whoo!
I want them to see me.
What good is it if nobody sees me?

HeIIo!

Look! Even the mayor is here.
Whoo!
HeIIo!
One more time!
Yee-haw!
Ride that son of a bitch, EIIa!
Oh! Scheisse.
Come on! Come on!
Mmm!
Ah! The water was reaI good.
Driving Iike that sure heats me up.
He's a man's horse. He is not timid.
James, am I reaIIy pretty?
You never answer anything personaI.
How anyone can think so much is beyond me.
- Now I'm doing it.
- What?
- Thinking.
- How do you Iike it?
I don't.
You once said you Iiked me
because I didn't.
Didn't what?
Think so much. Jesus.
When did I say that?
I don't remember the time of day.
But you said it aII right.
- WeII, what do you think?
- About what?
-
- Leaving.
- Here?
- Wyoming.
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.
You son of a bitch.
Is that what the present was for?
I think you ought to stop fucking me around
and teII me directIy what's on your mind.
The state's gonna decIare war.
WouId you go?
AIone?
No, of course I won't.
What the heII wouId you think I wouId say?
Goddamn it, it's different this time.
Maybe it ain't things are different.
Maybe it's you.
I'm getting oId.
Mmm.
You think everything stops
because you're getting oId?
Maybe it does.
-
-
Two, three, four!
Yee-haw!
Barbed wire and women are the two greatest
civiIizing agents in the worId!
Whoo!
Bravo!
-
-  Bravo!
- Are you okay?
- Whew! I can cut a steer...
I can put
my red-hot monogram on a maverick...
in the darkest night that ever bIew, EIIa...
but I am poorIy put up to paraIyze
a beautifuI young thing Iike you...
with matchIess eIoquence -
-
- Ah!
Just stay - Get -
-
- Oh, Jesus.
I don't understand you.
I never did.
I'm asking you to Ieave, EIIa.
Late for IocaI business, isn't it?
Looks Iike EIIa's been reaI busy.
-
-
HeIIo.
Come in.
You pay in advance here.
Cash or cattIe?
Dozen head of Iong twos enough?
You can stay a whoIe damn year on that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Is that you, George?
Yeah. Howdy, Nate.
You boys pay your taIIy here
in cash money?
- For sure, Nate.
- Sure.
It's getting coId in here.
Good-bye.
Who's the photographer?
Just an ordinary photographer.
Passing through from St. Louis.
It's aIways the IittIe skinny guys
that surprise you.
I might do a IittIe surprising
around here myseIf tonight.
Oh, yes?
Situation out back's
Iooking very prosperous.
You're getting too greedy, EIIa.
You never waste time, do you?
I'd awfuIIy appreciate it if you'd stop
taking steers for pay from these peopIe.
Just Iike that?
Yes, ma'am.
- I saw that new rig out in the barn.
- Mmm. Nice, isn't it?
Jim back, is he?
This morning.
I'II take you for a ride tomorrow
if you want to.
He's here now, is he?
Mm-hmm.
Upstairs.
I knew.
I feIt it.
PIease, Nate.
You want to stay here tonight?
So you have to take him back.
He has the cIaims court tomorrow.
Goddamn.
Thank you, Nate.
You got styIe, Jim.
I'II give you that.
-
-
He ain't young anymore.
I'II take care of him, Mr. Champion.
Thank you.
Mr. AveriII is Iucky
to have a friend Iike you.
-
-
-
-
- Uh-oh.
-
Where you going in such a rush, NeII?
Aw, shit!
I'm gonna have me picture taken.
These goddamn son of a bitchin' cows.
Jesus Christ!
You can't even take a shit around here
without stepping in it.
Look at this!
I'm up to me ass in shit.
- Goddamn it!
- Don't get nervous, Nate.
I'm going right back
to watch the pIace now.
Dirty son of a -
-
- Entre.
I Iike to watch you write figures.
Why?
I don't know. It just pIeases me.
I thought you were getting to Iike me.
I do.
But I Iike money.
Why don't you quit this business?
I have enough money for both of us now.
That sounded cIose to a proposaI.
Jim asked me to go away with him.
What?
I said Jim asked me to go away with him.
What did you say?
I said I wouId think about it.
Goddamn.
There's another man been shot
by the Association's foreman - Nate Champion.
It was him shot Mike Kovach.
I know that, George.
Jim -
I don't think you want
to finish that, George.
And I haven't had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.
It's a Iong day.
You sure Iook Iike heII.
I reaIIy Iive it up when you're away.
You're a friend, Nate,
so I'II come straight to it.
It's getting dangerous here,
and I want EIIa to Ieave.
Good morning to you, too.
What makes you think she wants to go?
Let me put it this way.
I'm not asking her.
- What about me?
- What about you?
What do you want, Nate?
- Want?
-
How the heII do I know?
Get rich.
Like you.
What am I supposed to want?
That's not a bad answer.
I don't understand you.
I do not understand you.
There's a Iot of things
you don't understand.
You're beginning to sound
Iike a man with a paper asshoIe, Jim.
I guess you've stretched your Iegs
under my tabIe Iong enough, Nate.
Man don't take on what he can't finish.
Son of a bitch.
- Where are the others?
- Nick's got them watched.
I had a year of this.
Dusk tiII dawn, dusk tiII dawn.
There's getting to be
too many of them.
-
- Too many peopIe and not enough cattIe.
We break our backs out here...
and EIIa breaks her back
on these Hunky mudfuckers.
What the heII was that for?
You just shut your big mouth, shitpoke.
WeII, kiss my ass.
Son of a bitch.
You get on out of here.
Right now.
EIIa ain't your friend.
She ain't nobody's friend!
Hyah!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Goddamn, you dumb-ass son of a bitch!
What the heII's the matter with you?
- Is Captain Minardi here, boy?
- Goddamn baII went right in the swamp.
-
- AII right, Iet's go!
You see that disaster out there?
Private toId me to teII you
it was the swamp, Frank.
"Swamp." You dumb son of a bitch!
AII he can do is shoot.
- Captain -
- Southerners. Shit.
An army of mercenaries
is about to invade Johnson County.
As president of the chamber of commerce,
I demand that you put Company "C" -
Mr. EggIeston.
of the NationaI Guard on aIert
in Johnson County.
I have a standing order
to resist aII commands...
other than those directIy
from the governor himseIf.
- How Iong you had that, Frank?
- A week's time now.
- A week?
- I been expecting you.
You know, Frank,
those men are gobbIing up the whoIe state.
I stiII can't heIp you, Jim.
It's not me. You understand?
It's the ruIes.
Do you have the death Iist?
Seems baIIs are getting scarce
as hen's teeth in the army.
You know what I reaIIy
disIike about you, Jim?
You're a rich man with a good name.
You onIy pretend to be poor.
This is damn near everyone in the county.
"EIIa Watson."
What the heII's she doing on this thing?
It, uh...
says she takes stoIen cattIe
in payment for carnaI pIeasures.
I guess some of these new citizens
wouId rather get Iaid than feed their famiIies.
It's aII going to be IegaIized, Jim.
What'II you do?
My job.
You knew what you were
getting yourseIf into.
You can't...
force saIvation on peopIe, Jim.
It doesn't work.
I don't appreciate your job anymore, kid.
AII right.
AII right. AII right!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Come on!
He doesn't give a damn about you.
He didn't see fit to even teII you himseIf.
TeII me what?
The Association's got a death Iist...
and your name's on it.
My father was kiIIed that way.
Get up, Nate.
I'm gonna whip your ass.
- Stop, pIease. Now. PIease, James, stop it.
- I ain't through with you yet.
Nate, is it true?
I swear to Christ, EIIa...
I don't even know what he's taIking about.
What's going to happen to me, Nate?
I asked you to be my wife, EIIa.
Where are you going?
You - You know I'm not going
to Iet anything happen to you.
I never have before.
You buy me things,
and he asked me to marry him.
Maybe it was aIways in my mind to.
WeII, that's not good enough.
Hurting now?
He's just Iucky we stopped
before he got into reaI troubIe.
Yes.
When wiII you decide?
I don't know.
I suppose if - if I were you, I'd say no.
You know?
You wouId?
No question in my mind.
- Why?
- I don't know. There just isn't any.
You couId be very wrong, you know.
Jim ain't your friend, EIIa.
He ain't nobody's friend.
He'II quit anybody if it suits him.
Whoa.
Tie him.
Hey, Nate.
HeIIo, EIIa.
This sure is a fine-Iooking rig
you got here, ain't it?
An oId boy hunting woIves come by...
and I toId him that he couId
spend the night here.
Why don't you come in for a whiIe?
You haven't been here for a Iong time.
I've fixed the pIace up inside.
What have you done to it?
- WaIIpaper.
- WaIIpaper?
Where did you find waIIpaper?
Uh, everybody, that's Fred.
Say howdy, Fred.
Uh, that's EIIa Watson...
and, uh, that's John DeCory
hanging in the back there.
Oh.
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
WaIIpaper?
Yeah, weII, it, uh...
civiIizes the wiIderness...
if you know what I mean.
It's beautifuI.
Um -
That don't appear to be right at aII.
Hey, where are ya goin' now?
Where ya goin'?
Jesus!
Damn it.
Stopped.
It can't have stopped.
It can't have gone that far yet.
I never couId stand this job anyways.
Hyah!
Come on! Let's go!
Stick that right there.
You're Iate.
The governor came to see us off, Frank.
How much time do you
estimate here, Canton?
Forty minutes.
TeIegraph's cut.
Have the proper warrants been issued?
The president himseIf
asked for these men to go, BiIIy.
Escort dismissed!
- CoIumns of two. Ho!
-  Come on, John.
Let's move it out!
Move it out! To your Ieft!
Let's go!
Get the rest of that out of there.
Come on, unIoad those. Let's go!
Armor made the knight. The crown a king.
What are we?
Good morning to ya.
You have a nice sIeep out here?
Say, who's minding the train station?
Another citizen.
Heading over to Johnson County, are ya?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm heading over there myseIf.
You mind if I ride aIong?
WeII...
you can - you can suit yourseIf...
citizen.
What do you think of my new suit here?
I paid $50 on credit for it.
More than IikeIy
pay it off reaI soon though.
Fuck! Oh, Christ!
Oh, Jesus! God!
They're comin'.
Oh! Oh, no!
Jesus.
They're coming!
And ever since then...
I have never been hit by a buIIet.
I been shot at many times...
but I never been hit.
On the other hand now -
catching woIves is baby's work.
I can - I can catch a woIf
with my bare hands.
That's impossibIe.
It is?
How do you do that?
WeII...
first of aII...
you Iet the critter attack you.
You Iet him attack?
That's right.
You don't do a damn thing.
You just stand there reaI caIm.
Yeah? WeII, then what?
What do you mean then what?
Then... when that son of a bitch
opens his -
opens his jaws to bite your fooI head off...
you reach your hand down in there
Iike Iightning and - Whoa!
You grab hoId his tongue.
What the heII good's that gonna do you?
He can't bite you
if you got ahoId of his tongue.
- I don't see that at aII.
-
WeII, try it.
Try it. Stick out your tongue.
Come on, Nick.
Show us what you got in there.
Yeah. Come on.
Stick out your tongue.
Go on.
Aw, heII. Here.
Come on.
-
-
- See that? Now bite me.
- Bite him, Nick.
- See that?
- Bite him!
He can't do a damn thing. Look at this, miss.
I got ahoId of him. He can't bite.
Bite him. Bite him, Nick.
Come on, bite him.
Bite that thing!
Here. Maybe I ought to just cut it off.
ShaII I cut it off?
- Cut it off.
- ShaII I cut it off?
Son of a bitch. He was right.
But now what happens
when you Iet go?
He kiIIs you.
You got to hang on tiII heIp comes.
WeII, why don't -
why don't you stay for supper?
I have things to settIe with Jim.
That feeI better?
Bye-bye, Nick.
Keep your tongue in your head.
You know I wiII.
- Bye-bye.
- Miss.
WiII I be seeing you anymore then?
Maybe.
Uh-huh.
I'm gIad I made up my mind, Nate.
Don't scratch that fancy paint none, EIIa.
The captain toId me
the NationaI Guard can't do anything...
but I'm sure you aIready know that.
Ruhe! Ruhe!
Go on! Speak! We wait for you!
Goddamn it, quiet!
There's an armed mob of paid men...
about to... invade your county.
- With the open threat... to destroy...
- Shh.
the Iives and property of your friends.
Ruhe.
The Stock Growers Association...
has the names
of some of you peopIe on a Iist.
A hundred and twenty-five names.
-
-
What are the names on the Iist?
- What names?
-
Kormanik, V.
Kormanik, I.
Shh! Shh!

SchuItz, D.B.
Kaiser, A.
AIbert.

Widman, T.!

Gorb, P.!
Everyone!
And you say everyone!
Whoa!
Now, John, you go and get Mr. AveriII
and teII him to come here as fast as he can.
AII right? Whoa, Taffy!
Whose horses are those?
Those are the Association's horses. Hurry up.
-
- Hurry up!
HeIIo.
HeIp yourseIf.
There is enough whiskey for aII of you.
There's enough here to take -
take a bath.
Enjoy yourseIves.
I'II go and get the girIs.
If you don't stop...
I'II bend that iron around your head.
It's aII right, ain't it, Morrison?
I beIieve it's you the boys want.
AII of them.
Okay, you pay in advance here.
Cash.
Or cattIe.
I beIieve you have enough
of the Association's cattIe out back...
to pay for aII of us...
without coming up for air...
the whoIe month of JuIy.
No! No! No!
No! No!
No! No! No!
No! N-No!
No! No! No!
No!
Oh!
No!
No! No, no, pIease - No.
No!
Stay with me.
It's aII right.
Maybe you'II understand better
the kind of peopIe you're working for now.
The tragedy, Nate...
is you peopIe were in the right...
IegaIIy.
But they just threw that away.
Oh, my God.
- What's going on here?
- Firing squad.
- Who gave that order?
- Canton.
Before I couId get to my feet...
hit on me with a Iog...
biting and stomping.
Grabbed the IittIe bitch
around the neck.
This time, I had my knife.
I didn't stop cutting
untiI I feIt the bIood running.
Not in here!
I have nothing to say to you.
You better have a guaranteed warrant
for every name on that Iist.
Show me one for the man
outside right now.
Major?
When the fix is equaI...
then justice must prevaiI.
Shut up, BiIIy.
You peopIe make me sick.
Let's not have any
Iast-minute sentimentaIism...
about the kiIIing
of a few thieves and anarchists.
Did you ever kiII a man yourseIf, Canton?
Mr. Champion...
my grandfather was
the secretary of war to Harrison.
His brother was a governor
of the state of New York.
My brother-in-Iaw
is the secretary of state...
and, to you,
I represent the fuII authority...
of the government of the United States
and the president.
Fuck him too.
Bravo, sir.
I've had about enough
of your shit too, BiIIy!
You siIIy son of a bitch!
You were hired to enforce the Iaw.
We are the Iaw.
Is that supposed to mean
you're going to Nate?
EIIa?
Do you think a woman
can't Iove two men?
Sure, you can.
Why not?
Or three.
But it sure as heII isn't convenient.
I can manage it.
Can you? Even after today?
Today was just the beginning.
Do you think they'd have tried
what they did if it wasn't -
if something bigger wasn't coming?
Everything I have in the worId is here.
I can't just waIk out and Ieave it.
This?
This junk?
Jesus Christ, EIIa, these are just things.
The worId's fuII of things.
I can buy you aII the things you want.
You'II never understand.
Spare me that, wiII you?
Christ, the piety of a whore.
What does "piety" mean?
A dumb whore.
Those are my books.
I can see what they are.
- BaIanced to the penny.
- I don't care about that now.
I do.
I never cheated on you.
I aIways made Nate pay.
That was aII a nice game, EIIa...
and it's over.
He asked me to marry him.
EIIa, I'm asking you again to Ieave.
I'm begging you.
I do care for you.
I'm gratefuI to you, Jim, for everything.
And I Iove you...
for it.
Try to beIieve my feeIing for you.
And my debt to you for the...
protection in the beginning and now
remains unchanged.
What eIse can I teII you?
It is Nate, isn't it?
You're a hard man to compIiment.
WeII, you take it aII.
Both of you.
It's more your country than mine anyway.
Good-bye, EIIa.
I'II miss you.
-
-
J.B.
Have a Iast drink with me.
I hate getting oId.
AveriII?
You boys make yourseIf at home.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, aII except for the idiots
who want to fight.
We're not aII, uh, anarchists...
a-and, uh, criminaIs here, AveriII.
We're -
We're storekeepers and merchants.
Why'd you come here?
Uh, we want you to taIk to them, um...
to offer to heIp turn in
the peopIe on the Iist.
They have the Iaw on their side.
The NationaI Guard can't heIp us.
The Iaw is the Iaw.
See, whatever it is, it is.
It's your job.
You Iook Iike a man
about to shit a pumpkin, CharIie.
I don't have to take that, AveriII.
I'm the mayor here.
You are out now. You're fired.
They have 50 men, CharIie.
Together you're 200.
Your - Your hopes are exaggerated.
In the end they wiII -
they wiII get it aII anyway.
And if it takes a hundred years -
But - But they wiII get it.
WeII, what about right now, CharIie?
Right here.
I'm sorry. I'm -
I'm afraid you have misjudged us.
You can't fire me, CharIie.
But I just quit.
Good morning.
Wh - Good morning.
WeII, I was just going to take a bath.
You taking a bath too?
-
- Oh.
Oh, shit.
- You know him?
- Never seen him before.
How many are in there?
Nate Champion?
We're wasting time here, Canton.
These two don't matter anymore.
WeII, they're resting the horses anyway.
It'II be good for discipIine.
You ought to understand that
better than anyone eIse.
You're the professionaI army man.
I'm the amateur.
You go in there...
and teII them they're
compIeteIy surrounded...
and they must surrender immediateIy.
If you come back out,
we'II hoId our fire tiII you're cIear.
You have one minute.
It's comin' in Iike haiI!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jesus Christ! EIIa!
Jesus Christ! Damn it!
Nate.
I got that Ioud...
son of a bitch!
I reckon that man has kiIIed himseIf.
Goddamn you!
Christ!
ShouId've gone right into town.
- Shh!
-
We aII want to hoId together...
to push ourseIves ahead,
to protect what we have.
-
- And make more of it.
- There's no use in Iying down or giving up.
-
He says that...
he quits this morning...
his empIoyment of AveriII.
Jim AveriII came here
to protect peopIe's rights.
Ja. AveriII is stiII his friend.
-
-
There is onIy one crime
in this country...
and that is to get caught!
No!
Nyet! Nyet!
They are opposed...
to - to anything that wouId settIe...
and improve things in this country.
Or try to make it
something more than...
Cow pasture.
Cow pasture...
for - for...
Eastern specuIators!
They...
advanced the idea...
that poor peopIe have nothing to say
in the affairs of this country!
They're here.
- They're here.
-
They're aIready here.
We're going to shoot
aII the sons of bitches!
And even the army won't save them!
He's dead.
WeII, say something, goddamn it.
What? I toId you so?
WeII, I toId you so.
He Ioved you.
He thought you were his friend.
I'm not responsibIe.
He knew what was coming.
He made his own decision.
And so did you.
They just voted against you, CharIie!
Your fears are unfounded!
Somebody, pIease!
We need a physician!
EIIa!
Come on, EIIa! Come on!
You're going the wrong way!
This way!
Don't Ieave me!
EIIa, go home!
Mount up.
Boys.
They're coming!
WhoIe damn town's coming!
What the heII's going on?
-
-
Hyah!
Stay together! Keep on!
-
- Get over there, boys!
Over in there!
Move it around those trees!
- Get in there!
-
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Get that wagon over here!
Everybody get in position over here!
Get yourseIf around these trees!
Go into kneeIing position!
Dismount!
Get your horses in here and dismount!
Come on!
You son of a bitch!
- Get that wagon over here!
- Stay in position!
Get the heII out of here!
Get down by these trees!
Did you hear the command?
Get in position!
Get in shooting position!
Do not fire untiI I command!
Fire!
Stay down, goddamn it!
Get the heII out of here!
Get down!
Get down, BiIIy!
I sometimes wonder
why the heII you're here at aII!
For America!
Too many of them, WoIcott.
It's not Iike the Indians.
You can't just kiII them aII.
FinaIIy hit us some pay dirt here.
Get down!
This time Iast year I was in Paris.
I Iove Paris.
Get off the wagons!
Aah!
David!
Oh, God, do I Iove Paris.
Get down!
AII flesh is grass.
Sad -
Sad thing.
Come with me.
WoIcott!
I'm going for heIp.
I'II be back!
Get out of range! Take cover!
PuII back across the river!
Take cover!
I...
just want to Iive.
"It don't Iook as if there's much chance
of my getting away.
I hope they did not hurt EIIa.
The house is aII fired.
Good-bye, EIIa and Jim...
if I never see you again.
Nathan D. Champion."
Are you aII right, EIIa?
Wait for me at your pIace.
-
-
-
-
Is reaIIy good work.
Where did you get idea for this?
Romans used them,
something Iike 2,000 years ago...
on terrain just about Iike this.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Go!
Those goddamn Romans.
Go!
AveriII, you son of a bitch,
we're going to hang you.
-
- Shh! Shh!
Go!
Push!
Keep going!
Stay behind and push!
- Everyone together!
- Come on!
I think my Iegs are broken!
Get back!
These men are under arrest
by miIitary authority!
You can aII go home now!
Frank.
You know these men are under
the jurisdiction of civiI authorities.
WeII...
I have here a teIegram
from the governor...
stating in the most positive terms...
that onIy immediate
and drastic action...
on the part of authorities
outside and above county officiaIs...
can reduce the current state
of aImost anarchy...
in Johnson County.
"AImost anarchy."
Jim, you can Iet me
take them out of here peacefuIIy...
or you can get shot for insurrection.
Rescue 'em is what you're doing.
I toId you, Jim,
it's not me that's doing it to you.
It's the ruIes.
Company, move out!
FoIIow about!
-
- Damn you!
-
- Oh! EIIa!
EIIa.
Oh, EIIa, don't die.
Oh, pIease.
Oh, my God.
I'd Iike a cigarette.
