ANNOUNCER:
Oh, you two are a big help.
Here I had
that gal sweet-talked,
eating right out of my hand,
you two have to bust in
and hustle me out of there.
Well, you just be grateful
we got you out of trouble
before it happened.
Yeah.
Well, you know what I think?
Well, it couldn't be much;
it takes brains to think.
Yeah, well,
I think you're jealous.
Just 'cause I find
the only pretty gal in town
who's not wearing
some man's brand.
Didn't I tell you
he's short on brains?
Ah, but she  wearing
some man's brand, Casanova,
and he was rounding up
a few of his friends,
and they were fixin'
to take you apart.
But there was no talk about
putting you back together again.
HOSS: And me and Adam being
the charitable fellers we are,
we just decided your hide
might be worth saving.
Uh, not that we care, but, uh,
Pa might've been a little upset.
That was a.45.
Sounds like it came
from old Pete Redfern's place.
Nah, he don't own no.45.
Hyah.
HOSS:
Pete.
:
They got everything.
Three years' work gone.
Pete... did you get
a good look at 'em?
They was wearing masks.
One of 'em was a big... redhead.
A redheaded man?
Hat fell off.
There was... four of 'em.
Pete... don't you worry,
we're gonna get a doctor
for you out of Virginia City.
LITTLE JOE:
How is he?
He's just fine.
Ol' Pete ain't hurtin' no more.
Hello, Miles.
Ah, morning, Mr. Cartwright.
Denver around?
Yeah, inside.
Walkin' about
six foot off the ground.
Nervous as a rustler in church.
He hasn't had this buggy out
since that schoolteacher left.
Now, don't tell me
he's gettin' married.
No! Ain't gonna get married;
don't have to.
Gonna have a woman
around the place again.
- Connie's coming home?!
- Yep.
By golly! Ha-ha!
- 4:00 stage.
- Yeah?
I tell you, Mr. Cartwright,
that man's scared to death.
And I reckon since she's been
back to that Eastern school
going on four years, he figures
she's the queen of England.
Well, you know, she's gonna see
a lot of changes in this place.
Yeah, Denver's done a good job
with it in four years.
Well, for the love
of Zachary P. Taylor.
That you, Denver?
Yeah. That's me, Denver.
Where are you preaching?
Nowhere.
But I wish I was.
Behind a pulpit, I could
take off these doggone gaiters.
Ben, do you think
a man's feet keep on growing?
Well, I've heard that, uh,
when a person gets older
his body shrinks--
I don't know about feet, though.
Well, I haven't had these gaiters
on since the Haroldson wedding,
but I swear, either
they're a size smaller
or my feet are a size larger.
Ben, you think I look all right?
Well, you know,
if I didn't know better,
I'd swear you were a senator.
- I'm going in to meet Connie!
- I know! I know!
- Did Miles tell you?
- Yeah, he told me.
Sure I told him.
I ain't forgot how to talk.
Doesn't seem like
four years, does it?
It does to me.
I tried to get
the house fixed up
so Connie'd have a decent place
to come home to.
I don't know...
you think she'll like it?
Oh, looks real nice.
I had some new curtains made
for her room.
- Yeah?
- Some kind of lace.
Uh, uh, they're
real pretty to me.
Well, then it is real pretty.
Eh, what are you worried about?
That little girl
won't even know the place.
I know, I know.
But she's grown up now.
You make it sound
like she's an old maid.
When she left here,
she was a kid.
What do you know about it,
you old goat?
Who's an old goat?
I ain't more than
two years older than you are.
That makes you an old goat.
For two cents, I'd quit.
For two cents, I'd fire you.
Now, hold on, you two.
How long have
you known each other?
Too dang long.
Since before Connie was born--
that's long enough.
Well, Denver, if I were you, I'd
hold on to Miles as a foreman.
You give me one good reason
why I should.
Well, if you don't,
Connie'll have your hide.
Hey, you better
get going, Denver.
That stage is liable
to be early.
Well, it hasn't happened yet,
but I suppose it could.
Ben, you wouldn't want
to ride in with me, would you?
Well, no, you... you two
have a lot to talk about.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Four years is a long time.
- Yeah.
Well, you sure
I look all right, Ben?
- I told you!
- Yeah, like a senator.
Ben, you can't lie worth a hoot.
Well, then, uh...
like a state senator, then.
Oh, there is one thing.
Yeah, what's that?
Well, I was thinking...
it's a little
short notice, I know,
but this is Saturday night,
and, uh, Connie coming home,
I thought I'd like to give
a little welcome home party
for Connie at
the Ponderosa tonight.
Well, that's fine, Ben.
If I can get these gaiters
broke in by that time.
Well, if you want to,
you can come barefoot.
- Thanks, Ben.
-
Connie'll like a party.
Well, I guess
I'd better get along home
and have the boys spread
the word around about the party.
Oh, I, uh, won't be able to make
the party, Mr. Cartwright.
Somebody's got
to watch the store.
Aw, sorry about that, Miles.
HOSS:
That's all we found on him, Pa.
We followed the four men
till we lost their trail,
then we went back
and buried Pete.
Not very much to leave after
a lifetime of hard work, is it?
What could anybody expect to get
robbing old Pete Redfern?
Well, I don't know, Adam.
Some people said Pete did fairly
well with that mine of his.
He could've had some money
stashed away somewhere.
Pa, this seems to me
like it's a...
like it's an organized outfit.
This is the third robbery
in less than a month.
Now it's the first killing.
Pete was killed because he got
a good look at one of the men.
Oh, that so?
What'd he say about him?
Well, not much, except--
except he had red hair.
Hmm.
Well, I'll talk
to Denver McKee.
He might be able to pick up
the trail you boys lost.
Yeah, he...
probably could at that.
Old Denver's about half
bloodhound anyhow.
Well, meantime, you go ahead
and pass the word
around about the party.
I don't think Pete would want
to spoil Connie's homecoming.
You keep quiet about this.
I'll talk to Denver.
Right, Pa.
Hey, is that you I smell,
little brother?
Well, it couldn't be
you or Adam.
You two smell like horses.
Smells a bit like the Wednesday
Afternoon Ladies' Society,
don't you think?
Yeah, or maybe-maybe Walsh's
livery stable.
Hey, will you fellas
take a long walk?
Like, to China?
Well, now, little brother,
we'd be happy to,
but we gotta
hang around here a little--
take care of your hide.
Well, I'll tell Connie McKee
to be sure to thank you.
Oh, uh, Joe, uh... remember,
don't mention anything
about Pete Redfern
at the party, okay?
Yeah, right.
Did he have any kin?
No, no.
According to Pa, his wife died
a few years back
and that's how come
he's out here mining.
Hmm. Well, you boys see
a redheaded man
at the party tonight,
be sure to shoot first
and talk about it later.
Hey, wait a minute.
Josh Perkins is coming
to that party tonight.
He's redheaded and the best dang
barber in Virginia City.
I sure wouldn't want
to shoot him.
Well, you know, I would
if I were you.
Look at the haircut
they gave him.
Here you are, Charlie.
Wonder what's keeping
Denver McKee
and that daughter of his.
They're late.
Now, listen, Fleming,
have you ever taken a woman
anywhere and be on time?
Little Connie McKee.
You know, the way she used
to ride that horse,
I thought she'd break her neck
before she got a chance
to go to school.
Wonder whether she changed the
East or the East changed her.
I guess the East rubbed some
rough spots out of her,
but I imagine she's still
the same girl she was.
Least I hope so,
for Denver's sake.
He was shaking like a leaf
when he went to pick her up
at the stage.
Here's to Denver McKee.
The greatest sheriff Colorado
ever had.
Here's to Denver McKee.
The best Indian scout
in the U.S. Army.
Here's to Denver McKee.
The most frightened father
in Nevada.
Ah, there they come.
It's got to be Connie 'cause
she's with old Denver.
I don't know.
It don't look like
Connie to me.
You want to know
something, fellas?
I don't really care
who that is.
Welcome home, Connie.
Hello, Little Joe.
It's so nice to see you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Is that the way to say hello
to an old friend?
In the East, that's the way
we treat fresh men.
Looks like you two
are going to take up
just where you left off
four years ago--still fighting.
Hello, Hoss.
It's so good to see you.
Hi, Connie.
Doggone it, we like to not even
recognized you.
You wait right here.
We got a real big
surprise for you.
All right.
Adam, how are you?
Well, Connie, you have changed.
Not so you could notice.
You still got
that same old sweet temper.
Hello. How are you?
Welcome home, Connie.
Thank you.
I didn't expect
a welcome home party like this.
It's so wonderful.
Oh, I'd forgotten
how beautiful the Ponderosa is.
Well, she put on
her best party dress for you.
Denver, she's your daughter--
you'd better introduce her
to the guests.
Thanks, Ben.
Folks, most of you remember
my little girl,
but for those who don't,
Connie McKee.
- Welcome home. -Good to see ya.
- Welcome home, honey.
Oh, it's beautiful!
But it's a shame to cut it.
Well, we can't eat it
till you do.
Yeah, just make a wish first,
and then blow.
She's a real beauty, Denver.
She sure is, Ben.
I can say that 'cause I can't
take any credit for it.
She's the spitting image
of her mother.
Yeah.
I only hope I've done right.
About what?
Connie.
How do you know
about girls, Ben?
You see, I didn't want her
to grow up here
like a wild bronco,
marry the first saddle tramp
that asked her.
Oh.
Or get tired of the ranch
and head for San Francisco
to twist the town by the tail.
I wanted to give her
what you've given your boys--
security, background.
I want her to have a chance
to see something besides steers
and horses and a kitchen stove.
Well, you've done it.
And I know it hasn't been easy.
Thank you.
Here's a little peace offering.
Why don't we call it a truce?
Well, seeing as
you started the war, I accept.
There'll be another war,
Little Joe,
if you try to hog
the guest of honor.
Uh, Connie, why don't
we go somewhere
where we can draw up
a peace treaty?
I have a better idea:
Let's have some punch.
Hey, that is a good idea.
Why don't you two go ahead?
Well, come on, fellas.
Connie and I are old friends.
But Connie wants to make
new friends, don't you, Connie?
Since you've been East,
Little Joe's a changed man,
Connie.
He doesn't seem any different
to me.
CLANCY:
That's just on the surface.
Underneath, he's wilder than
a locoed steer, right, Mort?
MORT:
Wilder, some times.
In Virginia City,
they have what they call
the Girls Protective
Association.
When Little Joe comes into town,
all those mamas go into action.
Why, Little Joe, I had no idea!
Miss Connie, would you care
to meet some of my friends?
Yes, I'd love to.
Oh, Connie, I...
I hope she isn't really mad
at Little Joe.
Oh, no,
she's not mad at Joe.
She's trying to show him that
he isn't the only man in Nevada.
Do him good.
What's the matter,
little brother?
You having trouble?
She acts like I got
typhoid fever or something.
What's the matter
with me, anyway?
Uh, got a couple hours,
I'll tell you.
Ah, never mind.
She's not the only girl
in Nevada.
Mm, but she's the prettiest.
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna really eat
the rest of that?
Hmm. It's too good a cake
to let go to waste, Joe.
Thanks so much for everything,
all of you.
That even includes you,
Little Joe.
DENVER:
Thanks, Ben.
For a while there tonight,
you made me forget
Connie'd ever been away at all.
Well, the short straw stays,
the rest of us get Denver,
see if we can pick up
the trail of the killers.
Well... guess who's got it.
Guess you stay, Joe.
LITTLE JOE:
Shoot.
Well, I still don't see
why we all can't go.
Well, somebody has to stay here.
Make yourself useful, Joe.
Help number-one cousin
with the dishes.
Uh, that's pretty good shooting
there, Denver.
A useless way
to spend money, Ben.
I just started wondering
if I still had the touch.
Well, I guess
it's a little like swimming--
a man never forgets.
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I guess we better get started.
Get started where?
Connie, I didn't want you
to be bothered with any of this,
but you see, yesterday,
an old prospector
named Pete Redfern got killed,
his life savings stolen.
Oh, that's terrible!
Well, it's more than that.
Last night, two men got killed,
and the Silverado Mine payroll
was taken.
We're just going out,
scout around,
see what we can find out.
I see.
But why do you have to go?
But Connie, I just told you.
Three men have been killed.
I'd almost forgotten
about the violence in the West.
And the fact
that nobody is immune
or wants to be.
Well, we mean to try
to put a stop to this
before there's
any further violence.
Do you?
Or do you enjoy it?
No, we're just trying to do
what we feel we have to do.
Well, leave my dad out of it.
He spent most of his life
with violence.
It wasn't a game with him.
It was his business,
and he retired.
Can't you leave him alone?
Connie, these are neighbors
asking me to help
because I know
about these things.
Connie, last year,
completely, without a trace...
and 50 men couldn't find them.
Now we're looking for four men.
Now, the sheriff needs
all the help he can get.
Now, if we find the men,
and I hope we do...
well...
...it's not gonna make us
feel good,
or not gonna make us feel big
and brave.
That's right, Connie.
None of us get any joy
out of this.
Just something
that has to be done.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cartwright.
You will be careful,
won't you, Dad?
I didn't get this old
being careless.
Connie, you try not
to think about it.
Where'd you leave Little Joe--
back at the Ponderosa?
Oh, he's got a few chores to do.
Uh, not too many.
Nice day for a ride.
If Little Joe wants to see me,
he knows where I am.
The only trouble is,
he can't leave the ranch.
Well, let him stay there.
I certainly have no intention
of running after him.
Hyah. Hyah...
Hyah. Hyah.
Oh, you're late.
Don't tell me
you were expecting me.
Oh, Pa didn't tell you
I had to stay here
and do a few things
around the house, huh?
I really don't remember,
because I really don't care.
Oh.
Well, in that case, you probably
wouldn't be very interested
in a little present
I was fixing up for you.
- A present for me?
- Mm-hmm.
Yet if you don't care,
there really isn't
much point to it.
Did I say that?
Yeah, well, didn't you?
Well, I may have,
but that was before
you mentioned a present.
Oh.
Well, they really
taught you a lot
in that girls school
back East.
How to be mercenary
in one easy lesson.
You're so wrong, Little Joe.
No woman alive needs
that lesson.
She's born that way.
Oh, I just didn't know
they admitted to it.
But since you did...
How do you like him?
Oh, Little Joe,
he's beautiful!
If that's the way
you say thanks,
it'll just take me a second
to rustle up about a dozen more
just like him.
Never mind.
One beautiful horse
like this is enough for anybody.
Maybe so,
but I don't hardly think
one kiss is enough for anybody.
Why, Little Joe,
I thought you had to stay back
at the ranch.
Not when I have something
better to do,
like, uh, kissing my best girl.
You mean, kissing girls,
don't you?
Any girl?
Well, now, where in the world
did you get that notion?
It wasn't hard.
Almost everyone
at the party last night
volunteered that information.
And more.
Oh, you're not
gonna believe them.
Well, why shouldn't I?
Because they're lying.
You mean there's no such girl
as, uh, Joan Curry?
Oh, sure there's such a girl
as Joan, but she's a...
And, uh, how about,
uh, Carol Childress,
and Judy Polk
and, uh, Sally Putnam?
How do you do it?
You haven't been back 24 hours,
and you know every girl
I've ever talked to.
I have only mentioned four.
Would you like me to tell you
the rest of the list?
No, never mind.
Of course, uh,
you didn't do anything
when you were back East,
except maybe knit socks.
Oh, you know very well
I went to a girls school.
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
only the way I heard it,
there was a boys school
right down block.
How long is your list?
You'll die wondering,
Little Joe.
Look, Connie, those girls
didn't mean anything to me.
They... They were just...
Girls?
Yeah, that's right;
they were just girls.
Well, that's exactly
what I am--a girl.
Mm-mm.
No, you're a very special girl.
Connie...
there was something
I wanted to ask you.
Are you going back east?
Well, I'm not sure. Why?
Well, just don't want you
to go back, that's all.
Well, that's hardly
reason enough.
Because I think
you're very beautiful.
That still isn't much of a...
Because I like you very much.
I've only been back
for 24 hours, Little Joe.
Tell me the same thing
in 24 days.
Now if we cut across
the rimrock,
we can come in
through the breaks.
Hi. How come you three
are back so soon?
We lost the trail.
Four horses?
How'd you lose a trail
like that?
It wasn't easy.
They went into the flint canyons
up near timberline.
Rock's so hard there,
you can drive a thousand head
of cattle through that part
and never leave a sign.
They got to be up here
in the Sierras somewhere.
Up one of those high meadows,
probably.
- They, They gotta have grass
and water. -BEN: Mm.
Yeah, but Adam, there must be
We could ride for a year
and not find them all.
Or we could find them
the first day.
They've had
all the breaks so far.
It's about time we had one.
We'll ride out at dawn.
Uh, Pa?
Hmm?
I, uh... I'm sorry.
I can't go with you.
Oh?
You mean there's, uh...
There's something you prefer
to the High Sierras?
Well, no, it's just that, uh,
you see, I didn't expect
you'd be back so soon,
so I promised Connie
I'd take her into Virginia City.
Ah.
HOSS:
Hey, Joe,
ain't you afraid you might be
over-courting that little gal?
I mean, you keep on like this
and she's liable to think
you want to marry her.
ADAM:
Uh, Joe...
I think you ought to ride
up into the mountains with us.
It, uh... well,
there's a lot of snow up there.
and maybe it'd cool you off.
HOSS: Yeah, what-what's
your big rush anyhow, Joe?
You done without that little gal
for four years.
One more day ain't going
to hurt nothing.
Pa, you want me to ride
with you, I will.
:
No.
No, you go ahead
with your plans with Connie.
Thank you.
You know...
I think our little brother's
coming down
with a real bad case
of love-itis.
Mm-hmm.
Never mind the love-itis;
let's get back to this.
Now, look, we get up
through the high meadow...
Pa, I'm getting about
half-tired of this canyon.
We must have been up here
seven or eight times.
I'm not only tired of the
canyon, I'm just plain tired.
But this is
where Denver lost the trail,
so this is
where we start hunting.
Start and finish.
Above here, there's a half
a mile of flint and wash rocks,
four canyons, and all the points
of the compass to choose from.
- Pa.
- Hmm.
What if they ain't
up there at all?
What if they just come this far
to make us think
they're going up there?
With us behind them?
They'd have to head
for high country.
Just a minute now, Adam.
What do you got in mind, boy?
Well, sir, a fox will double
back on the hound, won't it?
- Yeah.
- How come a man can't?
I mean, they could lead
their horses across the rocks
and get over
into Little Branch Canyon,
and go all the way
back down the valley,
and then leave us hunting
up here in the big country.
Yeah.
That might be just
worth looking into.
Come on.
HOSS:
Four or five horses, Pa.
They did double back.
Well, one sure way
to cover up your tracks
is to ride down the busiest road
you can find.
They did take
quite a chance, though.
They might have been seen.
Yeah, but I'm thinking that they
just didn't care if they were.
What do you mean, Pa?
He means that the killers
aren't strangers.
That's right.
They could afford
to double back.
I'm beginning to think
that they could even be
one of our neighbors.
Come on!
You can't keep your finger
off that trigger.
HARLEY: Wasn't my fault
one of them saw us coming.
Can still be easy.
I'll throw enough lead
into him to keep him busy.
Brennan can work
around back of the cabin
and drop a torch on the roof.
Come on, leave it!
Let's go, Hoss.
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
Corey!
Here, sit on this barrel.
-
- Easy.
Come out of nowhere.
One minute
it's quiet as a church.
The next minute, Jess is down
and bullets are whizzing
like bees at a swarming.
Did you get a look
at any of them?
Saw four of 'em,
all masked but one.
Hat on the,
the back of his head,
uh, red hair showing.
I never seen him before,
but I'd know him
if I ever seen him again.
It was no use, Pa.
They got fresh horses.
Ours were done when we got here.
What about the others, Corey?
Masked, like I said,
but there was one--
clothes, maybe,
or the way he moved.
I-I couldn't put a name to him,
but I, I-I swear
I've seen him a dozen times.
Looks like you was right about
'em being our neighbors, Pa.
Yeah.
Let's get Corey to a doctor
and then we'll make
a few social calls.
Easy, Corey.
Easy does it.
Well, the boys seem happy.
How about you?
Don't like the way
things are going.
Why?
What's wrong?
There weren't to be no killings.
We decided that
when we started all this.
Look, when you point
a gun at a man,
sometimes he has
to go for his own.
When that happens, you just
got to pull the trigger.
If I learned one thing
as a sheriff, it was that.
You never learned
to shoot no man in the back.
Harley's killing
of those two payroll guards
got this whole valley
stirred up.
Well, maybe Harley was
a little hasty.
Won't happen again.
I'll take care of that.
Meantime, we've got
a posse on our necks.
Why worry about that?
I've led other posses
around in circles
till they got dizzy and quit.
I can do it again.
This ain't other posses.
This is Ben Cartwright
and his boys.
They ain't going to quit.
We're simple, honest cowmen
from sunup till dusk,
just chasing strays
out of the draws.
Denver, they're not strays.
Any good cowman rides by,
he's going to see
you're just drifting a few head
up and down the valley.
Now, we've been
in this a long time.
How come you're getting
sweat up about it now?
'Cause I'm thinking of Connie,
like we both was
when we started.
Miles, I know you love that kid
like she was your own daughter.
I know you're worried about
her finding out; she won't.
Couple of more jobs
like the last one,
we'll have everything
we ever wanted for her.
I don't figure it that way.
Now, wait a minute.
You getting ideas
about quitting me?
We both ought to quit, Denver.
But I don't think we can.
What are you getting at?
First it was just you and me.
Then you sent me out
to the Colorado badlands--
pick up a lot of hard cases,
give 'em big talk
about big pickings.
Well, they've had a taste of it.
You can't expect them
to let go now.
I can call this thing off
anytime I want to.
Can you?
Harley, Brennan, all of you.
We heard talk about some
of you boys wanting to pull out.
Where'd you hear that?
The payroll we've piled up--
we're better than $30,000 now.
That's nothing
to what we're going to do.
We got more men coming in,
good men.
Denver here was wondering
how you men felt
about a man quitting
with his share if he wants to.
Why, nobody better even think
of pulling out.
We come here to clean up.
That sets real good with me and
that's what I'm aiming to do.
Isn't that the way
you feel about it, boss?
Sure.
Yeah, Miles and I just wanted
to see how you felt.
Don't worry, boss.
The first man tries
to run out on us, I'll kill.
Ben! Come on in.
You fellows look
as if you could use a drink.
A little water
would be right fine.
Trouble?
Well, they, they jumped
Winkler and Corey.
Wouldn't you know
they'd put up a fight.
Winkler got killed
and Corey got hit.
Bad?
Well, not too bad.
Thanks.
Got in the shoulder.
He'll be all right.
Did he recognize any of them?
Nope.
But we ran across
the trail of one of them
before--a redhead.
That redhead had to be the one
that killed ol' Pete Redfern.
BEN: Ran across the trail
of another one of them.
Corey tells me that he's seen
him before.
Recognized him by his walk,
set of his shoulders.
Corey says he must have
seen him
a dozen times somewhere.
Without his mask,
he'd be somebody we know.
Might even be a neighbor.
A neighbor?!
I find that hard
to believe, Ben.
Well, I didn't want
to believe it either,
but we picked up
their trail today.
They doubled back on their
tracks right down the main road.
They didn't have
to worry about being seen
because they're seen there
every day.
More killings every day.
That's why we're here, Denver.
I spent the better part of my
life as a peace officer, Ben.
I was lucky.
I only caught one bullet.
You got a sheriff,
you got all the men you need.
Don't ask me to press my luck.
You pressed it when you went out
with us the other day.
We're all taking
the same chance.
Not according to the odds.
I've been riding a streak
of luck for 30 years.
I don't intend to press it
any further.
So far, they've only hit the
miners and the mine payrolls.
They might decide to branch out.
You could be helping to put out
a fire in your own house.
My own house?
All right, about time I started
taking care of my own house.
Been taking care of other
people's houses for 20 years!
What the devil it ever get me?!
A hundred dollars a month,
a lot of plaques on the wall,
a pat on the back
and a bullet in the shoulder.
Denver...
I had no idea you felt this way.
Well, now you know!
I'm sick and tired of taking
care of other people's troubles!
Don't you think I owe something
to my own kid?
Yeah, well,
I guess you got a right
to your own way of thinking.
Not gonna press you.
But we're going out
after those killers.
Come on, boys.
Hey, where'll I put these?
It's a good thing
she ran out of money.
You'd have had
to send in a hay wagon.
Oh, Little Joe,
you know perfectly well
I needed every one
of these things.
I'm sure you did, Connie.
- Stay to supper?
- Uh, no, thanks.
I better show my face
around the Ponderosa.
They're going to forget
I'm a member of the family,
start charging me
room and board.
He'll change his mind.
I'm going to put
these things upstairs,
then I'll be down
to cook supper, Dad.
You'd better stay, Little Joe.
She's a pretty good cook.
You got a wonderful girl there,
Mr. McKee.
That's what I always
wanted her to be.
I, uh...
I wanted to talk to you
about Connie and me.
Well...
What's on your mind?
Well, sir, Connie and I
have known each other
for a long time.
Haven't we, sir?
Yes, you have;
quite a long time.
And I know you've probably heard
a lot of stories about--
well, about me and those
Virginia City girls,
but I just wanted you to know
that they didn't mean a thing
to me; not any of them.
I hope you didn't tell them
that at the time.
Well, uh, no, sir,
not at the time.
I... Well, I'm...
Anyway, that's not the way
it is with Connie and me.
I'm very fond of her, sir.
Fond, hmm?
And if Connie will have
me, I...
Well, what I'm trying
to say is, sir,
I'd like to ask her to marry me.
Well, I don't think
there's any way
I can keep you from asking her.
Does that mean
you'd rather I wouldn't?
I don't mean that at all.
All I ever wanted
was for Connie to be happy,
have the chances
other girls have.
Sir, that's what I mean
to offer her.
Suppose I knew all along
this'd happen.
I should've known.
I should have known.
I'm sorry I upset you, sir.
Well, I'll be
getting on home now.
Tell Connie I'll see her soon.
Little Joe gone?
Yeah, he just talked to me.
I was hoping he would.
Like that, is it?
Yes, it's like that.
He mentioned marriage.
One thing at a time, Dad.
First you fall in love.
I thought you'd done
that already.
Uh-huh.
But you have to give it
time to grow.
To build dreams,
to be so filled with happiness
in the wonder of it
that you're about
ready to explode.
And then you get married.
Dear, all that we talked about--
selling all this,
heading east.
You were so dead set on that
when we first got here.
I know,
but I didn't realize then.
You thought you couldn't
be happy out here.
I didn't think so either.
That's what I didn't realize--
that geography has
nothing to do with happiness.
Oh, Dad.
I know why you were
talking about
selling out and going east.
And I'll always love you
a whole lot more
because you were
doing it for me.
But now you know.
I know.
Baby, all I ever wanted
for you was happiness.
Well, all right,
go ahead and say it.
What do you want us to say?
Aw, come on, Adam.
You been walking around it
like it was a rattlesnake.
All right, it's somebody
we know--a neighbor.
Well, come on,
say the rest of it!
You think Denver McKee
had something to do with it.
Now, nobody said that, Joe.
Nobody's even thinking it.
Oh, no? Then why did you tell me
about what Denver said about
not wanting to help,
then you drop it so fast I could
hear the thud when it hit?
The only thud
you hear is your heart
when somebody mentions
the name of McKee.
Pa, what do you really think?
I'd stake my life that Denver
had nothing to do with it.
ADAM: Well, I hope
you're right, Pa.
But we have to face the truth.
There was only one man that
wasn't at Connie's party
the night the Silverado payroll
was stolen.
That's right--Miles Briscoe.
Yeah.
You know,
when I was telling Denver
about the party,
Miles was with him.
He said he couldn't go
to the party
'cause he had to look after
things at the Flying M.
All right, so he wasn't
at the party.
Does that prove anything?
No, of course
it doesn't, Joe, I...
But it's worth looking into.
Hoss, why don't you ride out
to the McKee place,
have a look around,
and if Miles leaves the ranch,
trail him.
How long do you want me
to stay, Pa?
Well, one of us will
relieve you in the morning.
Ah, come on,
don't look so worried.
Dad-burn you, Joe.
Like to scared me to death.
You must be half Injun.
You was plumb up on me
before I knew it.
You ain't seen anything?
Not a thing.
I think we're wasting our time.
Yeah, well, we're young,
brother.
We got plenty of time.
Maybe so, but as slow
as it went last night,
I feel like I'm 90 years old
already.
I'm gonna go get me some sleep.
All right.
Breakfast is all ready.
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.
Then sleep's going to be
the second thing I get.
Hey, Hoss.
Take a look at that.
A redheaded man, a stranger,
Miles and Denver.
Come on, let's go get
Pa and Adam.
Right.
I'm telling you
for the last time.
Don't you come around
this ranch anymore.
That red hair is like
a lantern.
You've been seen--twice.
Don't make any difference.
The two that seen me ain't
doing any talking.
Well, you're wrong.
Pete Redfern identified you
before he died.
And Corey,
the miner you shot yesterday,
he's still alive.
Well, I must be out of practice.
You're not out of practice.
You're just out of brains.
I think we ought to lay low
for a while,
till things quiet down.
You fellas sound like you're
getting a streak up your back.
You set up this play, Denver.
The rest of us have been
taking all the risks.
Sure, we had to do
a little shooting.
I want you to clear out of here!
You think I want my daughter
to see you?!
No, I don't think much
about your daughter
one way or the other, Mr. McKee.
And I'm tired of sleeping
up in those rocks.
You got a bunkhouse back there.
I mean to use it.
DENVER:
Good morning, Ben.
Morning, Denver.
You know this man?
Sure he knows me, Ben.
What about it?
We've been looking for
a redheaded man.
HOSS: You're the only redheaded
man in the area--
other than a barber
in Virginia City.
Since when has being
redheaded a crime?
Since we found out that
a redhead killed two men,
and maybe two others.
Do you figure to do
anything about it?
Dad!
Connie!
You take Connie back
into the house.
Right.
Come on, Connie.
Come on.
BEN:
Now put away your guns, boys.
You won't need 'em.
You're taking a lot of chances,
aren't you, Ben?
I could outshoot you
any day you lived.
Maybe so.
There's no reason
for it to come to that.
Denver, why?
I'd have staked my life you had
nothing to do with this.
Why?
That's very simple, Ben.
I ran out of money.
I did what I had to do.
And I'm not backing down
from it.
There are other ways.
What other ways?
I did a good job as a marshal.
When I needed money,
I turned to what I knew best.
I did a pretty good job
at that, too.
Denver... I'm going to have
to take you in.
Now give me your gun.
No, no, Ben.
You got to take it.
HOSS:
Pa, he means it.
Yeah, Ben, I mean it.
No, Denver, no.
Denver...
Now don't you go
blaming yourself, Ben.
A man pulls a gun on you,
you got to draw your own.
You got to pull the trigger.
He could outdraw me
any day of his life.
And he could shoot
a lot straighter than that.
You sure you want to go?
I have to go, Joe.
I have to get away.
I need time to think...
and time to forget.
I understand.
I love you.
