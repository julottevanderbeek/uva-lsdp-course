DIEGO: Where is
the meeting?
In the church.
Is Quintero with them?
Yes.
Senor Quintero,
for... for three years
they have heard
nothing but talk.
Now, when are we
going to do something?
When are we going to get
the soldiers off our necks?
Soon, my friend.
Soon.
But first,
we must grow strong.
In one week
I go to Sonora
to meet with
the Revolutionary Council.
If I can show them
the support of the people,
and the young fighters
in the hills,
they promise that the generals
sympathetic to our cause
will come over to our side.
The Presidente will run
before our strength.
Then,
you will be
free to live as men,
and not as animals.
And what about Lobero?
He is a bandit and a thief.
Oh, it's hard
to respect the law
when you feel the heel
of its boot on your back.
I'm not so sure that what
Lobero wants from the revolution
is the same as we want.
Well, he says
he wants to help.
And he has many guns.
Do you trust him?
Only his guns.
For the revolution, I would
make a bargain with the devil.
So why not with Lobero?
Let him join us.
Perhaps, after we win,
he will change.
Oh, it is time
for me to go.
MAX: Senor Quintero.
Please,
be careful, huh?
You took a big chance
just coming here.
Hmm.
In these days,
one takes a chance
every time he wakes up
in the morning.
DIEGO: Quintero,
we are waiting!
It's Diego.
They're all over the place.
Benito?
Is he dead?
Yes, he's dead.
MAN: I told you we
should have brought guns.
Guns? What guns?
DIEGO: Quintero!
It is useless
to resist.
We must wait
for our time.
Take this.
It will help.
Somehow,
I don't know how,
we will be together, eh?
If I live.
Shh.
You will live.
DIEGO: Quintero!
I do not like
to be kept waiting!
Look at your leader.
The little dove
who would be an eagle!
Take a good look.
You will not see him again.
This...
This is who you follow
but you go nowhere.
He talks.
Oh, how he talks,
but he does not fight!
Must we teach you
again and again?
To resist the President
only brings death!
Will you never learn?
Tie them up.
They have done nothing.
Why make them suffer
because of me?
Perhaps you are right.
They do nothing
on the farms.
They will do
nothing in prison.
We are short
on rations,
so why feed
stupid mouths?
Lobero.
Lobero.
It's me, Maximiliano.
Hmm?
What happened?
Quintero's been captured.
The little dove
is in the rat hole!
I told you not
to let him come, no?
Nobody listens to Lobero.
Now, we will have
to get him out.
Tomorrow.
But every time
we do we don't.
But every time we do
we don't what?
Every time we go in,
we don't come back.
Two brothers I have lost
trying to get
your uncle out.
He's right, Lobero.
We're going
to need some help.
What do you mean need help?
I have men. I have guns.
It's not enough.
Is not enough?
You have a plan?
I know someone
who can help us.
Someone
who can help us.
Who is this great genius?
This great man?
I have never seen him.
All I know is that he's a
friend and his name is Chris.
And he will help us
because he love us.
MAX: No, no. For money.
For money?
How much money?
$600.
$600?
American?
American.
You have the money?
What do you think, Miguel?
I think we should do as he says. Ah!
I don't care
what you think.
Okay.
All right.
Maximiliano,
you go.
But you better
come back
with the cannons
and the guns
and the dynamite,
and the whole
shooting match.
MAN: Gonna be a hangin'!
JUDGE: You got anything
to say, stranger?
I said it all
at my trial.
You didn't
believe me then.
MAN #1: String him up!
MAN #2: Hang him!
Kill the horse thief!
You, uh,
you wanna know my name
before you hang me?
Not particularly.
Just your last words.
I demand a recount.
We've been all
through that before.
It was your word
against the Garrett boys.
Three of the finest
men I know.
Born and bred right here
in this town.
You mean three of the
finest liars you know.
Stealing a man's horse
in this country
is worse than
stealing his wife.
There's been too much
of this thing goin' on,
and I'm going
to put a stop to it.
Horse stealin'
or wife stealin', Judge?
Come on, Judge,
let's get on with it. I got
some steers want brandin'.
All right, boys,
get on with it.
I'm a reasonable
man, Judge.
Give him a recount.
All right, Coley.
Whatever you say.
JUDGE: Everybody in favor
of hanging this man say "aye".
ALL: Aye.
Against?
No.
JUDGE: And who says no?
Me.
Just who are you to say no?
Who do you have to be
to say no to a rigged court
stretchin' the neck
of some poor slob?
JUDGE: And what
would you suggest?
Well, she's just
another horse.
She's nothin' special.
She...
He could be anybody's.
This man says it's his.
Huh?
This man says it's his.
One of them's a liar.
Better prove I'm a liar.
I can't do that.
Then who can?
The horse.
It's all right with me, Judge.
Take the horse out
in the middle of the street.
Come on, horse.
Come on.
Come on, horse.
Come to daddy.
Come on, Billy-boy.
Come on.
Billy-boy.
Come on, Billy-boy.
KENO: Come on, Billy-boy.
Yeah, come on, fella.
Come on, Billy-boy.
Come over here.
Come on.
Come on, Billy-boy,
come to daddy.
That's it.
Come on, Billy-boy.
Come on.
Come on, fella. Come on.
Yeah. Attaboy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
JUDGE: Well, that's fair and
square, and good enough for me.
Case dismissed!
We'd better get out of here
before they wise up.
COLEY: Hold it, you two.
I'm overrulin' the Judge.
There's something
real snaky goin' on.
I know you, Chris.
A lot of people know you.
Mostly sheriffs.
That's my horse!
I want him.
And I'm gonna have him.
I'll count to three.
They'll draw on two.
One.
Two.
Let's go.
That's my horse!
Let's get after them!
Is that your horse?
Nope.
Coley's the thief.
Stole my horse in Dodge.
Rigged faro game.
So you stole his, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's only fair.
You didn't really have to
call me a poor slob, did you?
Name's Keno.
I like that better
than "poor slob. "
I know you from someplace.
Fresno, Laramie,
St. Joe.
You ever been a lawman?
I just got out.
For what?
No questions.
No questions.
Hello, Chris.
It sure seems to be
my day for strangers.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, you were magnificent.
Both of you.
There you were,
standing on the scaffold.
Alone
and friendless
and the crowd is yelling,
"Kill him, kill him!"
But you stand there,
ready to die.
Proud
and defiant
and unafraid.
And suddenly,
there's a voice.
"No. "
And Chris,
Chris steps forward,
as cool as the other side
of the pillow.
One man against a thousand.
Chris, I'm so glad
I follow you.
My cousin said to me,
"Find a man
who's called Chris,
"and he will help you. "
Who's your cousin?
Well,
in Mexico,
everyone is a cousin.
And all the cousins
are in trouble now.
Big trouble.
Angel Quintero
has been captured.
He's our only leader.
With him, we are something.
Without him
we are nothing.
He's in prison.
We need your help.
Have you tried
to get him out yourself?
We have the will
but not the way.
Diego, the prison comandante,
he's a crazy one,
and our hands are tied.
That's, uh, "a cat with,
"with mittens
doesn't catch the rat. "
You'll help us?
I have money.
I have lots of money.
Here, it's all yours.
$600.
KENO: American?
Yes, American.
This prison,
is it a big one?
It's the Cave of the Rats.
It's like a fort.
I've heard of it.
I'd need help. More men.
We have the men.
Quick with the guns
but slow with the brains.
Six men.
Not enough to cause suspicion,
just enough to do the job.
Six men, $100 a man.
You like?
Yeah.
I like.
It's a deal.
Thanks.
Oh, Chris.
Chris, uh,
can I fight with you?
Oh, it's not for the money.
I... I could not take it.
But it's for Quintero.
Not on the basis
of what you did against Keno.
Oh, well, I'm young,
I'm... I'm strong, I'm angry.
And I will learn.
Besides,
my cousin says that seven
is a lucky number for you, no?
What's your name?
Maximiliano
Bienvenido O'Leary.
Why do you people
always have such long names?
I don't know.
Perhaps it's because
we all have such short lives.
Well, Chris,
can I fight with you?
Welcome, Max.
Thank you, Chris.
MAN: Cave in!
MAN #1: Cave-in!
MAN #2: Cave-in!
CASSIE: We'll
get you out of here.
We'll get you out,
we'll get you out.
Hold on.
I'll get you outta here.
Get him out!
Get him out!
That's great.
Just great.
That's gonna cost us nothin'
but time and money.
I told you
it might collapse.
The surface charge was
too much and too close.
You're all back
and no brains, boy.
So you stick
your damn advice.
The company shouldn't hire
your kind in the first place.
Go on, pick up your card
and get your butt back up in
the trees where you belong...
CHRIS: He ain't
worth killin', Cassie.
I wish I was as sure
of that as you are!
BOSS: You're through,
you hear? You're through!
Get the hell off of this property
before I call the Sheriff!
Go on!
What the hell
are you doin' here?
I'm lookin' for you.
What's on your mind?
I got something goin'.
I need you.
Who is this?
Name's Keno.
This is a rough go,
huh, Cassie?
Yeah.
If I hang around
here much longer,
I'll end up in jail.
CHRIS: Wouldn't you
rather blow one up?
For money or for laughs?
About as much as
you'd make in a year.
$100.
Not many laughs.
I don't work here no more.
I just might
take you up on that.
Chris, Chris, how are you?
It's good to see you.
Levi.
Long time.
Say, I'm sorry
about your hat, stranger.
Yeah, so am I.
Levi, this is
my friend, Keno.
Well, then you're
no stranger.
Levi.
Come on in.
Get in there.
Well, sit down, sit down.
This is my...
This is my wife.
She's a good woman but
she don't like strangers.
Just me.
So I notice.
Yeah, kind of surprise you a little bit
that I got these shots left in me? Huh?
You didn't wait
very long to fire 'em.
I didn't have much time.
Say, supper's
just about ready.
We're havin' beans.
Hope you like beans, Keno,
'cause that's all
we're havin' is beans.
KENO: Fine, fine.
Milk for the kids.
No whiskey.
We can't afford it.
KENO: Land does look
a little tough and dry.
Oh, it's like jerky.
A dry well don't help none.
Why don't you dig a new one?
Haven't got time.
I gotta feed
the family first.
Would $100 help?
What's the action?
Prison break.
In Mexico.
No, Chris.
I packed all that in.
I do my talking with
my mouth now, mostly.
Besides, I'm too old.
Time for settin'
and lookin'.
Most of the time, anyway.
$100 would
dig you a new well.
Buy a lot of staples.
I ain't as fast
as I used to be.
You're probably
a lot smarter.
And you look
just as tough.
Well, what do you say we
find out the way we used to?
One, two, three.
I think you're just bein'
kind to me, Chris.
In more ways than one.
No, I've got guns.
But nobody handles
a knife like you do.
MOONLIGHT: Beans, Mr. Morgan.
Beans, Mrs. Morgan.
I'll think it over.
Buffalo Ben is he?
Never heard of him.
It ain't all that hard to shoot
at somethin' that don't shoot back.
Besides, I don't like rebs.
I think I just might shoot the buttons
right off of that mangy uniform.
Ow!
Now you better get your
friend to the doctor.
BARKER: I-It's just
a part of the show, folks,
just a part of the show.
Now, step right over here
and meet Dot and Billy Joe
Hatfield for only 10 cents.
One thin dime,
the tenth part of a dollar.
Yes, sir, folks, the
one and only Billy Joe,
direct from the colossal...
Hello, Chris.
Don't you remember me?
Slater!
It's...
It's useless, Chris.
About as useless
as I am.
I've seen a lot of phony acts,
friend, but you're not one of 'em.
You're damn right
I'm not, friend.
CHRIS: Slater, this is Keno.
Slater.
I'm a freak, Keno.
I'm a half-man, half-gun.
Why, I can't whip a six-year-old
girl in a fair fight.
But I can blow a man's
eyeballs out
at 100 yards
in a sandstorm.
Yes, sir,
I'm a real attraction.
This is a tough way
to make a living.
You know a better?
Better than this.
Chris, nobody ever
heard of a one-armed gunnie.
Not until just now.
Can we see you
in town later?
Yeah.
You ain't just
feelin' sorry for me?
A wife and a gaggle of kids.
So you sold out, Levi.
No, no, I bought in.
You know, it takes a...
Takes a man my age to appreciate
a real woman. She's worth it, too.
Oh, I appreciate 'em, Levi,
every one I ever had.
I just appreciated
the hell out of 'em.
I don't think you ever
met a real woman, nino,
except maybe your mama.
"The... The men have to fight
and the women have to cry. "
I was lonely.
I wanted to say something
in my own language.
Why, Max,
do men have to fight
and women have to cry?
I don't know, Chris.
It's just a saying.
Comin' out.
I wish this was
for real money.
Well, it won't be long.
$100.
I never even seen
that much money before.
SLATER: Sure would buy
a lot of watermelon.
You're about to get yourself
all busted up, boy.
You rag arm.
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd break your back.
It was just a joke, Cassie.
A joke, that's all!
I don't see nobody laughin'.
Maybe it was a bad joke.
It was a bad joke.
Let him go, Cassie.
CHRIS: Queen bets.
In for one.
Yeah.
I call.
Yeah.
Comin' around again.
Ace with a queen.
Here we go.
Fours.
Yeah.
Jack, seven, ten.
May I have a word
with you, Chris?
These are my friends, P.J.
Queen-ace bets, one.
Call.
Hear you're lookin'.
I'm lookin'.
Well, I'm askin'.
You sure
you're up to it, P.J.?
Yeah, I'm up to it.
You wanna know what it is?
Well, if you're in,
it's all right with me.
You wanna know the money?
Whatever you say.
There's a seat
open over here, P.J.
CHRIS: Seven here.
BOY: Papa! Papa! Papa!
Papa!
Diaz.
I warn you, sir.
Get out of my way!
Where do you live?
In the hills.
Have you no home?
They burned it.
Where will you go?
To find my father.
Well, maybe we can help you.
Why do you want to help me?
You ask
too many questions.
I asked only one.
Then I will ask one.
Where will you go,
if not with us?
I will ride with him.
What is your name?
Levi Morgan.
What's yours?
Emiliano Zapata.
I'll call you Emil.
I'll call you Levi.
All right.
He's the one
I told you about.
There he is, the one
I told you about.
Do you not know
interfering with a federal
guard is a prison offense?
So I made a mistake.
You have my apologies,
Colonel.
Next time you will
act differently, huh?
You may be sure of that,
Colonel, a lot differently.
What are you
looking for here?
Silver.
DIEGO: What else?
Gold.
Without supplies?
No food or tools?
You hunt silver with a gun?
You shoot it like an animal?
No. We thought we would
get our supplies here.
There's nothing here, senor.
No silver in the hills,
only rebels.
I'm glad you told us that,
Colonel.
If we see any rebels,
we'll report them to you.
You will not stay long, senor.
Only until we get
what we came for.
I trust that will be soon.
We all do, Colonel.
"A pig without armor
is still but a pig. "
MEN: Maximiliano!
Maximiliano! Maximiliano!
I see and you see.
All the young men
are hidden in the hills.
They'll come down when
Quintero is free and not before.
No, no, no, no.
So, so, so, so,
so, so, so, so.
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah.
Thank you.
MAX: Gracias.
It's Lobero.
Is that a welcome party
or a lynch party?
With Lobero,
you never can tell.
$600.
American.
Where are the cannons?
The guns?
The dynamite?
LOBERO: Is this...
These few men...
This is what you bring to take
our little dove from Diego?
You don't understand, Lobero.
I understand!
Does he understand?
That one.
LOBERO: He's the leader.
I can tell.
It is in the eyes.
Does he understand
that he will have to
fight against soldiers?
Soldiers, not Indians
with little bows and arrows.
Soldiers!
Ten times more than you,
He has a plan.
He has a plan.
He also has our money!
But I am the only one
that has the men and the guns.
What plan?
Where is this plan?
When I'm ready,
I'll tell you.
When he is ready!
Not when Lobero is ready!
When he is ready!
Well, give him
a chance, Lobero.
I do not need your advice!
All right.
I will wait.
But not for long.
Levi?
Yeah.
Will my father
ever come home?
Aw, you bet he will.
Levi?
Mmm?
Will you be my father
until he comes home?
You bet I will.
Levi?
What?
Why is it that
people always fight?
Well,
someday you're gonna be an old
man just like me, and when you are,
you may get an answer to
that question, and if you do,
you tell me, will you?
You bet I will.
Max?
Huh?
You ever been
inside the rat hole?
Not yet.
Well, you will be.
How's that?
We gotta get the layout.
How are we going to get in?
Just ride in.
SLATER: I'm a freak.
I'm a freak.
Half man, half gun.
I'm a freak.
Freak.
Freak.
Freak.
RED: Buffalo Ben is he?
Never heard of him.
CASSIE: Rag arm. You're going to
get yourself all busted up, boy.
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd break your back.
SLATER: It was a joke, Cassie.
A joke, that's all.
I don't see
nobody laughin'.
We need water
for our horses.
You must have permission.
Well, your Colonel
is an old friend.
I will check
with the Sergeant.
Permission to water horses.
The Sergeant, he will
talk to the Colonel.
This is a nice place
you've got here.
Thank you, senor.
The Presidente himself
gave us a commendation.
It's a big place.
Two-hundred men.
Does my friend work you
seven days a week?
It is hard work,
but only six days.
Sunday is no work.
Our wives come that day.
Early, I bet, huh?
Unhappily, no, sir. In the
afternoon, after church.
Some just say
they are wives.
I have two.
The prisoners' wives
come, too?
Never.
Seven days a week for them.
Well, have fun
with both your wives.
Ah, the treasure hunters.
You are just in time.
You will talk now
or you will
never talk again.
Who are your
district leaders?
Where are your guns?
What are your orders?
With what treacherous
generals do you meet?
I repeat,
with what treacherous
generals do you meet?
I cannot ask your
forgiveness, my friends.
I can only ask it of God.
The ceremony is over.
Soon there will
be another,
and another,
and another,
until you learn.
Did you find your silver?
No silver.
DIEGO: Where are
the rest of your men?
In the hills.
Oh, that is dangerous.
The hills are full of
bandits and criminals.
You will be leaving soon?
Good.
I would advise it.
I have advised it before.
Yes.
Very few men have
impressed me as you have,
Colonel.
Lieutenant.
Did you notice anything...
Anything unusual?
No, Sir.
That is why
you are not a colonel.
They did not
water their horses.
Why did they come here?
You've seen what I've seen
except in the prison.
You should be glad
you didn't see it.
That's 200 of them.
That's 30 to 1.
Thin odds.
What about Lobero?
You never can
tell with him.
He changes
like the wind.
Without him,
we might be dead.
P.J.: Even with him,
we might be.
You want out?
Nobody told you
that this would be easy.
You're being
paid to do a job.
I'm gonna do
what I have to do,
you're gonna do
what you have to do.
Anybody that
wants out is out.
LOBERO: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
When do we fight?
Ask Chris.
You.
You have looked,
you have seen.
LOBERO: What do you
wait for?
I say attack now!
You have been paid.
Earn it.
You have taken the money,
but you do not
deliver the goods.
What do you know
of this land?
Of my people
and their needs?
You are nothing but a
stinking, hired killer.
You say you have a plan.
What is this plan
for my people?
You're not one
of your people.
You are a liar
and a coward!
Now, you move any way
but backwards,
and you lose that eye!
Now, get outta here.
There go our troops.
Emil,
are you sure
this is the way?
I'm sure,
I think.
There are gonna
be three wagons?
That's what I saw before.
Chris,
I don't believe him.
Lobero.
About what?
The money.
You do not help us
only because of the money,
do you, Chris?
Like Max says,
you ask too many questions.
Drop it.
Papa! Papa! Papa!
Back in the wagon!
Go on, get in there!
Hey, get up.
Get back in there!
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Well, at least now we've
got somethin' to work with.
It cuts the odds.
Not much, but some.
Chris, I have 20 men.
One for each rifle and one for
each horse. They're ready to fight.
But can they?
Well, they're...
They're young, they're
strong, they're angry.
And they will learn, huh?
Right.
Drink.
Drink.
It is hot.
It is good for you.
You are skinny,
and you could be
such a fine looking man.
You have a good face.
Did your mother
never feed you?
Maybe I should
fatten you up.
About last night...
Thanks.
But of all of 'em,
why you?
I was the closest.
This uniform
didn't bother you none?
Why should it?
It's dead, man.
You're wearin' a shroud.
You don't know
what it's like, Cassie.
Bein' lonely and all.
People look at you like you're
some sort of animal or somethin'.
Slater, you are an amateur.
You don't know what
bein' lonely really is.
But if it's conversation
you're lookin' for,
you tell me how you
got to be a cripple,
and I'll tell you
all about bein' black.
Do they always
cover the wagons?
GABRIEL: Yes.
To keep the sulfur from
blowin' away in the wind.
Where do they go?
To the railroad.
How far?
Two, maybe three miles.
Every day?
Sometimes twice.
What's at the railroad?
A small place.
An office for the railroad and
a cantina for the Federales.
How's it goin'?
Rough.
They wanna learn. I tried
to teach 'em, but, uh,
some of 'em could be damn
good, but we need more time.
There's no more time.
Tomorrow's ladies' day
at the Rat Hole.
They'll hardly be
in a fightin' mood.
Too bad Lobero and...
We could still use him.
I don't think you'd
like him ridin' behind you.
Gabriel,
just in case.
No, Chris.
We made a deal,
it's yours.
When you get Quintero back,
we get that back.
Chris?
Yeah?
Can I go with you tomorrow?
No.
Why not?
You're too little.
Chris?
Mmm-hmm?
How big do you
have to be to die?
Go to bed, Emil.
CASSIE: You scared, Reb?
No.
I am.
You just don't give a damn.
Ain't that about it, Slater?
No, you just don't believe
in life after birth,
do you?
Did once.
Now I can't even get a job
to support my wife and kids.
CASSIE: And you think
you've got troubles.
You could've been a Black,
one-armed gunnie.
You got a wife and kids?
Yeah.
What happened?
She found a whole man.
Well, I guess that makes
her about half a woman.
You're better off, boy.
These people,
they got you hooked.
No man gets hooked
unless he wants to be hooked.
Besides, what else is there?
No more open land,
mountain man is dead.
Buffalo are gone,
soon the horses'll go,
then it'll be our turn.
You know anybody that'll
be sorry to see you go?
Maybe these people'll
be sorry to see us go.
What am I preachin'
to you for?
I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.
I hope you see me
tomorrow night, too.
Lobero!
Huh?
Maximiliano comes.
Well, tomorrow is the day.
So, he sent you
to apologize to me, huh?
He wants to beg me
to help him?
MAX: He does not even know
I'm here. He would shoot me.
He's a proud man.
A proud man.
He is a greedy man!
Look, perhaps,
in the beginning,
maybe he was.
But now,
now he feels for us.
Then let him
fight for us.
I hear that
he has an army.
Killers with rifles
from the Federales.
It's only a few farmers.
Listen, Lobero,
if it's an apology
you want,
I apologize.
I beg for your help.
Lobero, maybe you should...
Oh!
What has Quintero
ever done for us?
Has he made me
a General? No!
He has fancy clothes.
He makes fancy talk.
He's no more
than a politico.
What will get us guns?
A little man
with a funny hat,
or $600 that you
gave to a stranger?
Chris was right.
You don't have
big dreams, Lobero.
MAX: Only a big belly!
And the rest of you,
remember tomorrow
when you're half drunk
and all crazy,
that your brothers are
out there dying for you!
Maximiliano's right.
You have no big dreams.
Shh!
Shh!
My horse threw me.
My horse threw me
back there!
Ow!
P.J.!
Cassie!
Cassie!
Go!
Ah!
Take some men.
Kill Quintero, quickly!
Maximiliano!
Keno.
No questions.
It will not be long
for them now.
Oh,
did you find
your silver?
Do not worry, Carlotta.
He will not shoot us.
I know this kind.
He fights for money,
not for passion.
A matter of business
with him.
Maybe we can make
what you call
a deal, huh?
Where's your hero?
Lobero?
He was sick.
A bullet in, uh,
his belly.
Emil, uh,
I made this for you.
Uh, it's really just
a frog stick, Emiliano.
But if a man used
a real one the right way,
he might be able to
help his people one day.
Levi?
What?
Chris.
Chris, we're going to
scatter in the hills
and we're going to
fight them again.
We will stalk them
in the night like jaguars.
We will... We will sweep down
from the mountains like hawks.
We're going to tear out
their throats like wolves.
In the deserts, Chris, in the
valleys, all of us, Chris...
Goodbye, Chris.
GABRIEL: Max,
you must stop him.
Quickly! The money,
all the money, he forgot!
Chris!
Chris!
Max!
He did not forget.
Max, what did Chris say?
He said,
"The cowards die many deaths,
"the brave only one. "
