Winnetou, the great Chief of the Apaches,
has become a legend.
He has brought peace at last
to the mountains, planes and mazes...
of the vast land from Texas to New Mexico
and put a stop to the senseless bloodshed.
To keep peace among all men
is Winnetou's one dream.
But he knows that now, there is still
another scourge threatening it.
For bands of adventurers and desperados
have inevitably followed in the path
of the settlers, spreading fear
and terror in the defenseless young towns.
Gangs who lust for gold and who'll let no
man stand in the way of their getting it.
Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! No!
Help!
Winnetou!
- Are you alright?
Happy, the eagle
will always protect its nest.
Honest, I didn't want its eggs.
I spotted this.
Apanatschi is gonna like it.
- Yes.
If Winnetou hadn't heard your cries,
you would have missed her birthday.
Don't do it again. Come.
Apanatschi, how many times have I told you
not to shoot so near the house?
I don't care how old you are today.
- Oh, but father,
the woodcocks were just a few inches
above Winnetou's head. I couldn't miss.
It was such a beautiful shot.
- It really was a beautiful shot.
And your Father is very proud of you.
- Of course I am. I am also very proud...
that you came to see us.
Look at this. Do you like it?
It is for your 21st birthday, Apanatschi.
And may you have many more.
- Oh! It is just lovely!
Help me try it on, Mother.
- Alright.
And I was gonna buy her a pair of pants!
Now, Mac,
have look at your son. Happy!
Why are you looking so blamed innocent?
What's that you've got in your hand?
I was just looking at an old eagle's nest,
and I saw this.
Well, you look it. You'd better run along
now and get washed up. Hurry! Scat!
He'll soon be a man. You remember
that day I found a gold mine?
Yes, I do.
It was a long time ago.
And you didn't want anybody to know
until Apanatschi was grown up.
Now she is. I'll show her a surprise.
- Don't do it, Mac, don't.
The gold is yours.
Winnetou always felt...
you had a rightful claim to that gold,
married as you are, to an Apache.
Father! Winnetou! Apanatschi is dressed up
Like an Indian girl.
She looks really like an Apache.
- Yeah.
You sure look awful pretty.
- Didn't you say I had a surprise coming?
Oh yeah, your surprise!
Looks like we're being followed.
Now, I wonder who it is.
- I'll blow your head off!
Come out with your hands up!
- Don't shoot. It is me and Bozo.
Mama said I should get out of the house.
Did your Mother say to come up here
and crawl around like a hungry wolf? Eh?
He looks more like a wet kitten!
Don't send him back, father.
Ok. Come along.
- Gee, thanks!
Let's get going!
You better stay here now.
And don't you dare to follow us,
or you'll be skinned alive!
- Sure thing.
That rock's called
The Finger of Manitou.
Why are we here?
Come on, Apanatschi.
Here's the surprise
your father promised you.
Is it gold?
- Sure it's gold.
I don't understand. What does it mean?
- The mine is yours on your 21st birthday.
I want you to enjoy life
and be independent.
And you kept it secret? Does anyone else
know that the gold is here?
No, no one. Winnetou and l
wanted to keep it secret...
until now.
- From mother as well?
Nobody knows except you,
Winnetou and me.
Leave the gold where it is.
My sister has the heart of a true Apache.
She cannot be happy with gold.
It's only brought the Apaches hard luck.
Soon the White Man
would hear of this bonanza,
they would cut their way
right through here.
Apanatschi wants Jeff.
That's enough for her.
Apanatschi! Apanatschi!
Hello, Jeff. Happy to see you.
And the boys, too. I see you brought them.
Apanatschi rode out with her father,
but they will be back soon.
How are you?
- Just fine.
We take time off from work,
and the girl with the birthday beat it!
Come on, boys, it wasn't just Apanatschi
brought you two out here, eh?
I bet you just want a little whiskey.
- Well, they say...
the hopeful'd drink, huh?
- Come on, go in.
Halt! Here is where we part.
I must return to the village
of the Apaches.
The gold will make you rich, certainly.
I hope that it makes you happy.
Sometimes I'd like to visit
the Apaches in your village...
and go hunting with Winnetou.
- Apanatschi will always be welcome...
by the Apaches. And Winnetou
shall teach her how to shoot a raccoon...
and a brown bear.
- Can I do that, father?
I guess so.
Goodbye, Apanatschi.
- Goodbye, Winnetou. - Bye Winnetou!
You know, Mac, looking at your daughter,
I would take her for a white girl.
But her mother is an Indian.
- I am proud...
that my wife is an Apache.
- Now, don't forget you told Apanatschi...
she can come and visit us.
- Goodbye, Winnetou.
Let's go.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,
happy birthday, Apanatschi,
happy birthday to you.
- I just shot a woodcock, Jeff!
It flew right over Winnetou's head.
- Yeah, that's alright. If you say...
you bagged a wild bird in flight,
I bet you did it with one bullet, too.
I did! Father saw it.
- If you're really that good a shot,
you'll take the crown away from Pinky.
I would never try to fool you about it!
You must believe it.
Just because today is your birthday,
I will. Alright? - Thank you, Jeff.
Happy birthday, Apanatschi.
Get ready for my old magic trick.
Oh! Isn't that fantastic? How did you know
I've wanted such a hat for a long time?
It is not exactly meant for...
- Oh, Jeff. l...
I think it is a mite small, don't you?
Apanatschi. You see? It's a muff.
Like that.
I knew all along what it was.
- What...
Hi, Jeff!
Hi there, Happy!
It is good to see a friendly face.
How is it going, partner?
- Did you bring me something?
You bet I did.
The world's greatest magician is here.
- Jeff!
Now watch it. A little magic.
You appear to have Happy amazed.
Oh, a chicken.
- Ok, Mac. You got it? Watch this.
Now...
There you are.
Now, friend, a third.
Here it is!
Pincky gave up his hat!
Now I have seen everything!
- He'll charge you rent for using his hat.
Remember what you have to do, JeÂ¤
- Yep. I have to talk to your father.
I'm trapped, I guess.
- You're right.
Mr Haller?
- Yeah?
I'm gonna have to ask you to keep
to your word. You said we could marry...
when Apanatschi was 21.
- I see. Well, now.
If she wants to get married,
I guess I'll have to.
Oh! Father, thank you.
- Hug him, not me.
Is Happy snooping?
- He is.
Go on, sing along, Happy.
I just don't like to sing.
Apanatschi, more than 6 months
I was visited by 3 little brown bears.
And, believe it or not,
one of them washed my shirts.
That was a raccoon, not a brown bear.
- Hunter's jargon is hard to learn, yeah?
Or you area nature talent, Pinky.
- To say the truth, Pinky's running
as soon as a bear is coming near.
- Hey, I'll get mad, you...
Yeah, you get mad and off you go.
- Coward.
I'll show you who's a coward. Come on!
- You're always shooting just for fun.
No, we won't have a shooting.
Pinky passes out before we start.
You know,
I hate to leave the party, too.
How'd you get hold of this?
- Well, Pap and Winnetou set off....
an explosive. The stone blew all the way
to Alice Tanning, that's all.
Did you show it someone?
- Show a measly rock?
Bring us some more, Happy.
- Ok.
Well, what do you think?
Yep, it's gold, pure gold.
- And somewhere near there's a lot more.
You can be sure of that.
- We'll find out where.
Mac!
How come you never told us about this?
- Because it is my gold,
and I'd like to know where you got it.
- Happy said that you set off...
an explosion.
- Is it someplace nearby?
Well, Pinky, that's my business.
If I was gonna tell,
it'll be somebody that's close to me.
- You'd better go easy, boys.
Apanatschi, come on, pour us a drink.
You got no problem. As soon as you
marry her you get the mine,
and what do we get?
- You'll get rich. All I get is to go on
wearing traveler's clothes, I suppose.
- You better tell us where it is.
You understand?
- Don't forget that you're friends.
I'd rather give them half my gold
than have things this way, father.
That's ridiculous. There's no point.
It's ours, and it's gonna stay ours.
You'd better go.
No, Mac. I wouldn't want to have
to use this to make myself clear.
But if I have to, I will.
Get out!
Goodnight, Mac.
Well, it's too bad
they found out about it.
Now I hope they just forget it,
and soon...
No, Mac. Now those boys are smelling gold,
they won't be likely to forget it.
It's still Apanatschi's birthday present.
I'll ride in tomorrow and register...
the claim in her name.
I'll go tomorrow at dawn.
Hello, Mac.
- Good morning.
You boys are out hunting early.
Take us to that mine.
- I have a few little errands to do,
but when I get home we'll talk.
- Don't give me no trouble.
Sloan, I can see murder in your eyes,
and it's a frightening sight.
Looks like I got no choice.
Ok, boys, I'll lead you to the gold.
Will you saddle up mine? I've decided
to go out and shoot our dinner.
That's what you think. Just forget it!
- Hey! Just a minute!
Who you giving orders to?
- Listen. You know you are in danger.
Danger? Why?
- Nobody, but your Dad and you know...
where that mine is. Remember that.
Pinky and Sloan will stop at nothing.
Toss it over!
- What are you worried about, men?
That's not going to hurt anybody.
- Throw it over, Mac!
You miserable cowards!
- Toss it over, you!
Come on!
Jeff, that was father's rifle. I know!
- He must be in town by now.
That shot was not his.
- I know it is his, Jeff.
You shouldn't doubt me. I have gone out
hunting with father so often.
We have to go and see what is wrong!
- Apanatschi, listen...
I'll go alone and see,
and if I don't return in an hour
then you'd better go to Old Shatterhand.
He'll protect you.
I'll be back, though.
- Jeff, I will stay here.
No one will hurt me, you see.
No one told me about the gold.
Alright. See you.
- Jeff!
Where is your friend Old Shatterhand?
- At the railroader's camp.
In Rocky Town!
Pinky! Sloan! Get your hands up!
Alright, drop your guns.
Mac, quick! Get out of the way!
Mac!
Come on!
Why don't you shoot me?
- You ain't kicking the bucket so easily.
You're coming with us to see if you and
Apanatschi gonna show us to that gold.
And then you kill... both of us!
Save the bullet.
He's done for. Come on.
Jeff's been gone over an hour.
Maybe I should follow and see...
what happened.
Maybe he couldn't find dad.
You mustn't go, Apanatschi.
Ride to Old Shatterhand.
Watch yourself.
- Goodbye, Ma.
Alright, Mother.
Goodbye.
Where's Apanatschi?
- I don't know.
You are lying! Where'd the horses go?
- If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.
Apanatschi isn't safe here.
She won't return until someone...
has avenged her father.
Let's go. We'll find her.
It's alright. It's not bad.
Where's Apanatschi?
- Gone to Old Shatterhand,
as you told her to.
Good.
Mac....
Mac is dead.
Sloan and Pinky are chasing us!
- I can't go any faster!
Stop, you two! Stop!
- Run! Run!
Come here!
Hurry up!
Don't be afraid. I am Old Shatterhand.
You're really Old Shatterhand?
- Well, yes.
I'm Apanatschi. This is my brother,
Happy. My father is Mac Haller.
Jeff Brown sent us to you. We're engaged.
- My father located a lot of gold.
So, where's your father now?
- He gets our gold mine registered.
I'll get him and tell him where you are.
You go with Sam to the railway camp.
We'll see us later. Bye.
- Howdee, hunters. I am Sam Hawkens.
Jeff told us lots about you.
- If it wasn't all good he is a liar.
If it was flattery... Well, that ain't
gonna get him nowhere. Only, he's right.
That's some greed. - You should be glad
that they only shoot at coffins.
What'll it be, boys?
- We're buying for everyone at the bar.
Welcome to town.
And thanks for the drink.
What do you mean?
I don't remember inviting you.
A couple more red eye.
That was a good one. - Don't tell me
you haven't got money. You bought a round.
- That's because he just won at poker,
you see. But Mister,
don't think we're rich.
So, you won at poker?
How'd you like to get up a game?
He went broke though.
- Broke? It went fast.
And how the devil did you spend it?
- I warn you, boys, right now.
You'd better not be lying.
- Maybe you'd better look.
Alright.
Now, tell us where you found it.
Go on. Start talking.
- You'd better. Otherwise...
I'll have to shoot you boys up.
Now, start telling him. Tell him!
Come on.
- Music time!
Where's everyone going?
- Just step over here.
I'll tell you
why we're all pulling out.
There's a gang in town.
A bunch of criminals.
They'll ruin everything.
They shot our Sheriff yesterday.
Nobody in town's able to put a stop
to all this. So, we don't know...
where we're going, but we're going.
- How about the railroad camp?
You'll be safe there.
- Doc, you've got to stay.
You're needed here.
- I would stay, but tell me who needs me?
Since every one of my patients here
will be going, too.
Move over. I'm coming up.
Give them some more time, and they'll kill
each other off. You wait.
Now, look up Sam Hawkens.
He'll tell you what to do.
Well, pull out! Let's go.
- Will you keep your shirt on?
I must say! We've got enough coffins here.
- Let's hope we don't have to use them!
Come on, baby! Be nice.
Come here!
Come here, you little wild cat!
No! Let me go!
Alright. Tell me!
- I bought it from someone for 200 bucks.
Liar! Now tell me!
- We stole it from somebody!
It's true alright. We stole that gold.
- From whom and where did you steal it?
I know that fella.
Where's Miss Bessie?
- She's there.
Who is he?
- Some kind of scout.
You ought to get out of here, Miss Bessie.
- I am responsible for my girls.
I couldn't leave them here.
- I don't care what you say.
All of you are going.
- They'd kill us if we did.
They wouldn't let us go. The men here
don't like to be left without women.
I'll find a way to get you out of here.
- Thanks. Still, Curly Bill...
has brought 80of his men to town.
It's hopeless.
I don't see how we can get away.
Yeah. I hear they've been here
over a week now.
Well, I'm not quite sure what to do.
But I wouldn't be afraid.
We'll find some way to get rid of them.
- When you see Winnetou,
give him my regards.
You'd better watch out for yourself.
I'll do that, Miss Bessie.
Goodbye.
Now, you tell me where you got that gold,
or you're going to be getting...
a little drink that is gonna make you
anxious to tell everybody about it.
That's good. There.
Keep drinking, Mister. Open wide.
At a boy! Keep going.
I have a feeling I've seen you before.
- No, not me. You're wrong.
Look. He is my pal.
He's a bit drunk, that's all.
Rode over to town,
looking for some fun.
Why did you force him to drink whiskey?
- Where's your sense of humor?
Why were you following those kids?
I want a straight answer.
Apanatschi and Happy ran away.
Me and Pinky are friends of the family,
so Mac asked us to go after them.
- You tell Mac if he wants those kids,
he can talk to me.
I'm not giving them to you.
I'd be pleased to take care of them kids.
- With pleasure, Curly Bill.
But first, you'd better come with me.
One false move
and your boss is dead.
- Don't try anything.
Look out!
Give me the word, boss,
if you want me to get him.
I am beginning to see, now.
You were trying to find something out
from these kids. And I'll bet
you killed their father first.
He did it!
- Now, is that true?
Yeah, that's right.
- Let's go to the railroad camp.
That's the next move.
- Alright. Let's go!
Mac Haller is dead. I found him when I was
near the goldmine he gave to Apanatschi.
Where's Jeff Brown?
- He left to look for the murderers.
Curly Bill's got the murderer. I'm afraid
those kids won't be safe any place.
Winnetou will hide them with the Apaches.
But we must get started now,
to the railroad camp.
- We'd better hurry.
Sam Hawkens!
My pony's got to be shot.
The right foreleg.
Get her ready. Where'd you learn
to be so damn clever with horses?
I never learnt it.
I always liked horses.
Yeah, I always knew how to drink.
It just came natural. Yes, sir!
There! Look, that's her.
- And Happy, too.
We've got to get them both out.
- Go see if you can get them out.
Not in broad daylight.
- Coward! I'd like to kill you.
Come on.
Alright. Come and get it, boys.
You stay here and keep an eye
on what goes on after we leave.
Have them mount up!
- On your horses!
Come on!
In here the soup tastes good.
- Even out of water it's a fine soup.
We've got to case some dynamite up.
Help!
- Come on!
Hold it! Sloan, go see what's wrong
with your friend Pinky.
Hello, Pinky!
Looks like Pinky's hit the bottle.
Pinky, what's the matter?
Go on, get up, Pinky.
Well, Pinky ain't going to get up again.
That fat coward's dead alright.
- I know. He blabbed that I killed Mac.
But he was my oldest friend.
- I'll say.
Poor old Pinky. I'll miss him.
- Maybe we can fix it up for you.
Leave those two where they are,
for the vultures!
Now, listen here everybody.
Yesterday I sent you all here for safety.
And now, I hear
there was a daylight attack by Curly Bill.
Of course, nobody could have expected
that they dare such an attack.
And I tell you, they will come back
if you don't do anything.
I'm not telling you
to stay here safe from all harm.
Half your work is done.
Mac's killers are here.
I brought them with me.
They were my two best friends,
Shatterhand.
And they murdered Mac.
- Jeff, did you kill them?
No, I didn't. I think he was dead
when the others found him.
He was probably hit during the attack.
- By Sam Hawkens, if I'm not mistaken.
The judge?
- He killed Sloan.
Did my white friend see Apanatschi?
- Yes.
Then, tell me, why didn't you free her?
- Why where you taking a bath
instead of watching out for her?
- Oh, you know. Saturday's when I bathe.
But why they'd want Happy?
- Well, Happy's their hostage.
Men, look, do you want to stand this
any longer?
This band will be after you.
You have to defend yourself.
Or do you prefer to live in fear?
Do you want to be tyrannized by them
for the rest of your life?
That's why I tell you:
An eye for an eye!
We can't think of what to do that'd help.
- We'll do what you order.
Now with Old Shatterhand leading us,
it should be really easy.
The men are behind you. When do we move?
- Let's burn down the whole town
and smoke the devils out.
- No. Well, it's not all that simple.
First, we must save this boy and girl.
- Yeah, but how?
Does my brother wish me to do this?
No.
But I hope my red brother will help us.
Please go and see how Mac's wife is.
We're going to try and start
as fast as it's possible.
We've got to have weapons.
We can't do this with our bare hands.
Tell me just how many rifles there are.
- Anyone got a rifle he wants to use?
That's marvelous!
- You said it! When do we start?
We'll start tomorrow at dawn.
Dynamite can be a great help.
That is, if you know how to use it.
Except around here they don't know
what a fuse is. Isn't that right, Sam?
My brother, you mustn't worry.
You'll be taught... both of you.
Alright, Sam?
- What do I do now?
Nobody knows yet. I want you to ride
into town, make friends with Curly Bill.
Try to find out where he is hiding
Apanatschi and Happy. Now, be careful.
If you need help, see a friend of mine,
a woman. Just ask for Bessie.
Just tell her you know me.
You can count on me Shatterhand.
I'll leave right away. - Good.
Can he really be depended on,
or should I go?
I trust him. Sam, were you taking a bath
or weren't you, when you should
have been taking care of those kids?
- How many times do I have to explain?
It was Saturday.
So you won't tell us where your father
found that gold? Too bad.
That's a real pity.
- She's a pretty little thing.
Maybe until she's ready to talk,
we can keep her busy doing something else.
Cut it out, Judge! I said, cut it out!
I'll break her, yet.
Hank, listen. Go for some whiskey.
Judge, get the boy.
We're going to play a joke on your little
brother and pump him full of whiskey,
and he'll be a man after that.
That is, if he has any stomach.
I'll do whatever you say.
Please let my brother go, please.
I thought that would loosen your tongue.
- Where's the boss?
They're going to come here for those kids.
- Who's coming?
They're coming at dawn. The whole bunch.
- Oh? Well, let them come, then.
We'll give them a fine reception.
Go back to where they are.
And, you listen now.
They may have changed some of their plans.
You let me know, Jim. Judge!
- Here's your victim. Real tough!
Take them to the cellar
and lock them both up.
Why, those poor idiots are gonna try
to attack us tomorrow. Get down there!
Go on! Get back down there.
Go ahead. Go on. Move!
Check your weapons and then hit the hay.
I want you all
in good shape for the morning.
- And I warn you, no drinking.
Come on! Get down!
They probably think we killed the old man.
They'll fight as hard as they can,
but they're no match for us.
- Here, a lamp so the rats can find you.
Apanatschi, I am scared.
I am scared too, Happy.
Old Shatterhand and Winnetou
are going to come and help us out.
How can anybody find us?
- I don't know exactly, but they can.
Don't worry.
Apanatschi.
It isn't true what Curly Bill
said about our dad, is it?
I don't know what you mean.
What did he say?
That he was murdered and everything.
- They are just trying to frighten us.
Those men upstairs are wicked men.
Father couldn't be...
Don't cry, darling. Stop crying.
Do it for me.
Well, they couldn't have missed me.
They were too busy to notice anybody go.
Now, I better get going now and see
what they are up to. Â¤ Be careful.
Don't worry over a thing.
- Good luck.
I want you to stop all this drinking.
That's all for tonight.
Tomorrow night we'll have something
plenty big to celebrate.
And remember one thing about tomorrow:
I give the order to fire.
Nobody move until I give the order.
You got that? Anyone shoots early,
he gets it in the belly.
- Can hardly wait until the morning.
You make it sound like a circus.
- Circus?
Did someone say circus?
- What is it, your business? Salesman?
You're mistaken. A magician.
Now another.
Now, let me have a drink.
You call that a trick?
- Just wait a minute,
and you'll have a nice surprise.
- Will you stop this nonsense!
Marvelous, friend!
Who are you?
- Now, well?
Jeff. And who are you?
- He's stupid. He doesn't know the boss.
That's Curly Bill. And all of us here
belong to the Curly Bill gang.
Ah! So you're Curly Bill.
Well, sir. Let me shake your hand.
That's pretty good, Boss.
Don't let this guy get away.
I'm gonna have a little shut-eye now.
Bye-bye.
Two whiskeys, please.
Shatterhand sent me.
Where are the prisoners?
Trapdoor behind me.
That's where they are.
Not for long.
- You quit flirting with the lady
or you'll be in trouble.
The drink's on him. Shake hands, Mister.
You and your crummy tricks! Why,
I'll break your hand if you do that again!
Only a joke, Mister.
- Let go! Let me go!
Get down.
Get down!
Dreaded fuse things.
They're as tangled as my beard.
Alright, men. One of the first problems
is to hold your position
and to stay at your posts.
Let's look for a message from Jeff.
- I don't like this. It is too quiet.
It could be a trap.
They could know we were here.
Let's go.
Hey! That's enough of that, Mister.
You'd better go, or somebody might just
put a bullet through your head.
Just staying a minute.
That's it! Come on!
What made you shoot him?
- I am really sorry,
but I thought he was a crook.
- They're attacking from the railroad!
Everyone ready. Get going!
Listen, give the key to me now.
Sam, is there anybody up that tower?
- I don't know. I'll go. I'm brave.
Curly Bill,
the town is completely surrounded.
Come on and surrender,
or we will dynamite every building.
Curly Bill, think it over.
Come out with your hands up,
or you'll all be blown to bits.
I want to get you out.
Don't be afraid.
Winnetou and Old Shatterhand
are out there. Here! Quick! Come on!
Oh, I knew it!
- Take the lamp, you'll need it.
Keep going through the tunnel. It'll take
you out somewhere near the church.
You'd better hide in the bell tower.
I've got to stay here with my girls. Bye.
Church tower! Get them out of there!
Up there, he can wipe us out.
- Go, get me the children!
They won't shoot if they are here.
- Give me the key to the cellar.
I am busy. Just break it open!
- Those kids are stuck inside of here.
Hurry.
We are helpless as long as that guy's up
in the church tower. We can't shoot him.
Happy, come on!
Look out!
Winnetou!
You must get to the church.
I am gonna take you.
Hank!
Where's Mac with those kids?
- Been stitched up here to do this.
Hey, magician! Make yourself useful!
Get Hank up here.
They disappeared. - What do you mean?
Hank took them both and went.
But, how?
- What can we do about it?
They've got to be there!
- The place was safe.
But there is another way out.
Seems you have a tunnel behind the cellar.
I found it a few minutes ago.
What did you do there?
- Hank was a lot smarter than you.
He is probably safe now.
Because no one knows it exists.
We'll go and see for ourselves.
- Alright, let's have a look!
Take some dynamite.
How'd you ever escape, Apanatschi?
- I used the tunnel.
You see, Miss Bessie and Old Shatterhand
will be heartbroken.
So that's who she is.
- Can I help you shoot?
I think you'd better keep down.
You're a beautiful target.
Shatterhand, listen to me!
- What are you doing here?
Curly Bill and a bunch of his boys
are coming over. At about this time
they're in the middle of the tunnel.
- Winnetou knows where the tunnel ends.
Right over there.
- Good. The two kids are up there.
My thanks to you. Bye, now.
Listen, you look after him.
Go on.
We'll head for the cabin
when we get out of here.
Go on, now. Hurry.
We've got to dynamite our way out.
Give me a few sticks and I'll fix it.
You might really block it up.
- We can't move it.
We've got work to do. Come on!
- We'll be ok if we can get to the cabin.
Take cover behind the embankments.
Come with me, Sam.
All of you! Get behind the embankment.
Come on! Sam, over there.
Turn the back. Get behind the wall.
We want to take them by surprise!
Get ready to go.
Give me some of that dynamite.
I'm going to throw this out there.
And the minute it explodes,
you all run out of here, quick.
And takeoff on our horses.
- Right.
Get ready!
Dynamite! Stay low!
Does finding gold mean you must
die for it like my father, for one?
It is too great a sacrifice, Jeff.
Take me away.
Let's forget about the gold.
I never want to think about it again.
You have to now, Apanatschi.
Listen.
I warn you. Both your lives are in danger.
As long as you and Happy know...
where that gold is,
those men will stop at nothing.
Until we get rid of Curly Bill,
we'll never know a moment's peace.
Jeff, it will all be alright
as long as you love me.
Now we go to the camp of the Apaches.
Apanatschi and Happy
will be in good hands up there.
If you keep the promise you once made
that we go hunting,
I'll come with you.
- I promise that we'll take you.
And Happy. Come on.
- And Jeff?
Jeff will have to go back. He's got to
find out what Curly Bill's going to do.
They said something about a cabin
somewhere up the river.
Returning is too dangerous, isn't it?
- I left poor Hank in the cellar.
The key's in my shirt.
I'll free Hank.
He never knew it was me.
I'll just make up a story.
Curly Bill will believe me.
- Don't worry about Jeff.
He'll be alright. Come on, Happy.
Winnetou's taken the boy and girl
to the Apaches.
Which route are they riding?
- The shortest, I imagine.
Through a bear trail, he said.
- The Apaches will never see that old...
little spit-fire. You can bet on that.
- Better mount up.
What do you say? Aren't you coming?
With pleasure. Let's go!
Hurry it up! Get going! We've got
a head start on them. Now, move!
Wait!
This damn waiting.
- Might be...
they went through already.
- You mean they're able to fly?
That's them.
There are no riders.
But those are their horses, alright.
Yes. That black one's Winnetou's.
Let's try to get all three.
That's just what he wants.
If he hears the gun fire,
he'll turn around and go right back.
Simple.
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!
I'll be darned!
- We've been tricked!
We're out of range now.
You can come up.
You certainly know how to ride.
Winnetou is proud of you.
This young warrior needs a bed.
This is Apanatschi.
Her mother is Mine-Yota.
I want you to protect her and her brother,
since now I must go away.
I must have been crazy to fall
for that trick and let them get away.
But I'm going out searching
until I find those kids again.
I'll find out where they got that gold.
- Morning, boys.
How about a little drink, Magician?
- Sure, boss. But why a little one?
There's a man who knows
how to take a drink. Sit down, Magician.
There's your bottle. Go ahead.
- That's my style!
Hold it! Where do you think you are going?
- Pouring a drink for a friend.
At a boy!
Let's go!
First thing is to get the boy, Judge.
Happy!
Happy! Where are you?
At the creek. I am fishing.
- She's pretty far away.
Get the boy now.
- Alright.
Go on. Grab him, Hank.
That gold, boss. Do we share?
It's no time for questions!
You boys will split with me, right?
I'll go and get them.
Where are you, Happy?
I'm right here.
- I can't! shut up!
Happy, will you answer me?
Where are you?
Happy!
Answer me, Happy.
Happy, where are you?
Why don't you answer?
Happy!
Hey, Happy.
Happy!
- Get him to the horses! Hurry!
Now. We pick up the girl.
- No. We've got the boy.
She'll come on her own, Boss, and will
tell us anything to get the boy back.
Hank, let's have a chat. What about
the share of the gold you are demanding?
That was just a joke.
- Curly Bill and me thought...
you might have meant it.
- Hey, don't be silly. I mean...
Jeff! Jeff!
- Hi, Happy.
Don't tell me you know the kid?
- That's Mr Haller's kid.
Take him into the house.
You'll be alright.
You know, Mr Magician,
I didn't trust you from the day we met.
Something always did bother me
about your face. It is honest.
Well, in a few minutes
I'm going to string you up.
The hanging tree is already waiting.
- I would like a smoke.
Stop him! Stop him, I say.
What good is that? The boy's enough.
Winnetou. Let me go with you.
I want to help.
You know that I can handle a gun.
After all, it is my brother.
You can't go, Apanatschi.
I would rather take you, as I promised,
to hunt bear, rather than murderers.
Well, I am not scared.
- I will ride alone...
and there is a reason.
Jeff would be angry if I took you along.
Is Jeff alright?
- We all hope so, Apanatschi.
When he's back we'll celebrate a wedding.
- What if they harmed Happy?
Don't worry. You would have heard
through Jeff. Tell Old Shatterhand...
that Curly Bill has captured Winnetou.
I will go to Curly Bill, unarmed.
You can't expect to get out alive
going without your rifle.
Old Shatterhand will know exactly
what I am doing.
It'll work, I am sure.
You must do as I've said.
Now come. You must hurry.
This is for my brother.
- Goodbye.
We're getting tired of these delays,
boy, come on. What is it?
Now, tell me where the mine is, boy,
or I'll kill you!
How am I supposed to think
when you are shooting at me?
Stop shooting! Winnetou will show you
where the gold is.
I don't want him to know where it is.
The gold's Apanatschi's.
They don't bother me.
- I know Happy. You are very brave,
and I am proud of you.
Apanatschi sent this to her brother.
Here it is.
- Thanks.
And now I am going to tell you
where the gold is.
Tie him up.
Get away!
You want to know where the gold is?
Jeff!
Did you see Happy at the cabin?
- Only for a minute, Apanatschi.
But when they knew we were friends
I had to escape. He won't be hurt.
You go back to camp, Jeff.
Apanatschi will tell you what happened.
I'll see you both later.
I have to go to Winnetou. - Good luck.
Come on.
Who are you, stranger?
You sure you belong in this camp?
I work on the railroads. So what?
- Just a minute. Wait! No offence, sir.
Sorry. Well, what do you know?
Jeff and Apanatschi.
Sam, you know who that is?
It is one of Curly Bill's gang.
Don't move! Keep them up!
Go on. Get in there.
Go ahead!
There's the gold that makes
white men lose their senses.
Now, you shall keep your word
and free Happy.
Take the brat with you. There he is.
You shouldn't have done it.
I wouldn't have let him go.
How do you think we can exploit the mine?
They say Apanatschi's name...
is as owner on the papers.
- We'll take what we can...
and go to Kansas City.
- Bill, that's idiotic.
We could have it all if we...
- If we had a certificate.
Sure.
And maybe for the kid
they'd fork it over.
The mine will be ours.
- Let's go.
Get that boy back again.
Go ahead back to town.
Hurry!
Those men are following us.
Don't be afraid.
Thank you, my brother.
Don't overload the horses.
It is a long way to that tunnel.
Judge, I've changed my mind.
We're going to Kansas City after all.
I don't see no point.
I say we leave it to the men.
Everybody listen, now.
I want your opinions.
Do we take what we have
and go to Kansas City or not?
There's a lot more gold here.
Why should we go to Kansas City?
Put it away.
Get out!
I am the Boss now. Get back to work.
Men, Curly Bill's coming back to town.
We're going to get rid of him...
once and for all.
Now, here's the plan.
We're railroad workers,
and we ain't fighting bandits.
Why don't you get the soldiers?
- We haven't time for that.
Come on, now. Who'll volunteer?
- Right here!
Shatterhand, please take me.
I know I can help.
But, I could!
Take an example from this girl!
- Old Shatterhand, if you want to get...
into town, I'll be glad to ride you in.
- Thanks. Good idea.
Alright, men.
This time we get a ride with Jim.
Pull over, will you?
Now, distribute the dynamite
evenly all through the tunnel. Hurry up!
Cover the boxes with stones, so that
they don't know what we're going to do.
Sam, you and Apanatschi take this.
Put down the powder joining all the boxes.
Winnetou, come on outside with me.
I have to see the men out there.
That's right, get to work.
And let's hope you don't mess things up.
Apanatschi, bring me the powder.
- Here's the bag.
Come on, Sam, hurry!
Bring the boxes of dynamite inside.
Jeff will take care of them.
The best place to watch out for them
is up at the church tower, I think.
Hide your trail behind the church.
We don't want them to know...
anybody is here.
- Ok, Winnetou!
Put a trail right to the rear
of the church, up there. - Alright.
Watch the trail.
- Yeah.
Have to admit it, I guess. You're handling
the things real damn good.
I'm getting to like him.
- Let's go over this plan once more.
The bandits are gonna be here
before we know it. Now, listen carefully,
the tunnel runs right from the saloon,
under the square and to the cemetery.
We'll dynamite
while they're hiding the gold.
Don't fire until the first explosion.
Now, get into the houses.
I'll be stationed in the tower.
- Old Shatterhand! They're coming now!
Get going!
Alright. This is it. Wait for my signal.
I'm gonna get a drink.
- Shut up! Nobody will get any drink.
We have to get rid of the horses.
- Alright!
Look what I found. A box of dynamite!
Look. Look at it.
Here's a trail of powder! And the wire.
- Let's get out of here!
Let it go!
Come on. Let's get out of here!
Get out of here, come on!
Come on!
Go ahead!
To the other side! They are escaping.
I speak for the Apaches.
You are our friends. We are yours.
Put all this behind you.
Build a new town and a new life.
If you want the Apaches to help you,
then we shall.
Put your men to work tomorrow,
and we'll build a new town together.
I'd like to say, the gold
that has so far caused only pain to us...
I got the idea of making a gift of it
to my loyal friends.
I know that you can use it
to start your new town.
Komo tou lali tiko.
- Komo tou lali.
Komo tou lali.
Mother! Here we are.
Come, children.
If you like,
I'd be happy to stay a bit.
I haven't the words to thank you
for all you've done to help.
I wish you happiness. All of you.
When you need a best man, count on me.
- And don't forget this now.
You know who is really great
at crooning lullabies.
Come on.
- Stay well.
So long.
