Twisted bronc.
Like to break my back.
Rolling over on me.
I know that colt.
His daddy was a true outlaw too.
They're spooked tonight.
Why do I always draw nighthawk
when it's a full moon?
You shoot every stranger in Texas...
...you're gonna be more famous
than Quantrill himself.
You look like you seen a ghost, Real.
Your wife got a letter saying you died.
It was signed by the great
General Bedford Forrest himself.
Word was that you died a hero
for the Confederacy.
Well...
...truth be known,
I got shot in the butt.
And I don't remember feeling heroic,
General Forrest or not.
- Is the war over?
- For me it is.
You hungry?
How is she?
Seeing you is going to shake her.
You want me to settle the mustang?
This horse and I have come
a long way together.
Goodbye!
See you tomorrow!
Clare! Davis!
Wait a minute.
- Where you all going so fast?
- To go say goodbye to Sanders.
Afterwards, get your chores done.
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.
Clare, after chores,
help Davis with his arithmetic.
I will, Mama.
- Felt naked without my Colt.
- That's what britches are for.
Don't listen to him.
He's a mean old man.
We altered the hammer
and the cylinder...
...and we installed a side ejector rod
to punch out the empty shells.
- It doesn't feel much different.
- It might not...
...but that converted Colt is now
a custom-made precision firearm.
- Not that you know how to use it.
- Yes, sir.
Those boys will wanna play
poker with you.
No, ma'am. This gun stays
right where it is.
He has a mind for sums, but have him
practice his penmanship after chores.
Sarah, will you get my children?
Well, I'll vow.
As there's a God in heaven.
- Hello, James.
- I'm glad you're back.
This is your father.
No, he's not. Cable's dead.
You said so.
I was wrong.
You're a big boy.
Wouldn't have known you, either.
- Daddy.
- Hello, Clare.
Look at you.
Where's the baby?
Mary died.
Almost three years ago, of influenza.
There was nothing anybody
could've done.
Two days after she'd come down
with it...
...she was gone.
Three years ago?
I wrote you.
Half a dozen letters.
"There are old soldiers...
...and there are eager soldiers.
But, regretfully...
...there are very few
old eager soldiers."
Were you eager?
Clare says you fought
Northern oppression.
I fought to stay alive, son.
Ask him why a grown man
with three children would volunteer.
That's like asking a man
why he's short or tall.
He just is, that's all.
Mama used to say that the greatest
unanswered question of our time...
...was why you volunteered
for the Confederate Army.
You didn't have to go.
Out of the mouths of babes.
And we all know who put
those words in his mouth.
He enlisted because General Forrest
personally sent him a commission.
Your father trained the horses...
Let's not talk about the great
General Forrest.
He's the greatest horse general
that ever lived.
- Man goes to war when his country calls.
- He went to war to get away from us.
He went to war for God
and country and horseflesh.
- He thought it'd be a great adventure.
- Since I'm not dead...
...it is no longer necessary
to talk about me as if I was.
Anyway, we're gonna win
because God's on our side.
I don't know where God stands, son,
but the war is lost.
That's enough talk about the war
for one night. Let's get to bed.
Well, see you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, that was an interesting evening.
My daughter's always had
a prickly disposition.
You know, too much education
is a terrible thing for a woman.
- James Sanford, I missed you.
- Welcome home, son.
What do you wanna do now?
Well, must be 20,000 head of cattle
all over south Texas.
Real wants me to help drive them
to Abilene.
Is that what you wanna do?
We need the money.
Your father's a real artist.
I did it, if you wanna know.
You didn't answer my question.
I wanna go home.
It's what I dreamed of.
This is the money we got for our cows
when we left Arizona.
It is.
You never touched it.
No.
What do you wanna do?
Every day, I got up at sunrise.
Every day, I taught school,
I came home, I cooked dinner...
...I read to the children,
I went to bed...
...and I waited for you to come back
and take me home.
Put this horse to work, couple of years
you'll have a great stable.
Much obliged, James.
Arizona territory is still Union.
But with your eye,
this is good at 1000 yards.
The war is behind us, or so I thought.
Clare, we're moving out.
You'll come visit us in Arizona?
Daughter, you know
I'll never leave Texas.
What's the matter?
We've been talking. It's Sunday.
We wanna stop.
I figure three more hours.
Then we'll stop.
- Giddyup!
- Go!
Giddyup!
- Giddyup!
- That's it, Clare.
What's wrong with Daddy, Mama?
Nothing at all, Davis.
See those mountains up there?
When we clear them,
we'll be in Arizona territory.
Giddyup!
We're almost home.
Y'all hush and get to sleep.
They're so excited about getting home.
There were times, even on the
battlefield, I used to think about Mary.
Trying to imagine what she looked like.
I saw her when she was 2.
I saw her on her third birthday.
When she was 4...
Barely lived past 1.
Stampede.
Come on, Davis! Come on.
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.
Whoa! There's folks up here.
Stay back.
- Didn't expect anybody'd be up this high.
- We had a fire.
- We couldn't have stopped them anyway.
- Lightning spooked them.
You had no right driving horses at night
in a storm. Any fool knows that.
Austin, go get Vern and my father.
Joe, Ben, get the wagon up.
Most folks use the wagon trail
down below.
We figured it'd be safer up here.
- What's your name?
- Cable. What's yours?
Keep quiet.
Lorraine Kidston's my name.
Where you folks headed?
Didn't say.
She's from Philadelphia. I don't expect
her to know, but you boys...
Running horses down a mountain,
in the dark, in a storm?
Mama told them that.
I'll bet she did.
What did you say your name was?
Didn't say.
His name's Cable. The girl said so.
They said you were dead.
Wishful thinking for some.
You rode with that murderous
son of a bitch, Nathan Bedford Forrest.
After the war, we're gonna hang him.
You're gonna need a long rope.
We could shoot you right here.
Probably get a medal for it.
Bunch of Yankees murdering one man,
his wife and children?
They give medals for that in your army?
Ma'am, your home has been confiscated
by the Union Army.
- That's stealing!
- Clare.
Arizona never was a slave territory.
- Didn't fight for slavery.
- What the hell did you fight for?
When you betrayed the Union,
gave up your rights.
You folks should move on.
Save a lot of heartbreak.
Nobody's driving us off our land.
You figure you can drop us all?
You're first. He's next.
You care what happens after that?
You don't belong here.
Maybe you did once...
...but not now.
Giddyup!
Looking for John Denaman.
Well, he's not here anymore.
- What about Luz or Manuel?
- You know Luz?
Since she was 7 years old.
- What's your name?
- What happened to Denaman?
Nothing. He just died.
You're not dead!
No, Luz, just a little tired, that's all.
- Martha.
- Hi, Luz!
Clare!
You're gonna be as tall as your pa!
My God.
- I bet Davis doesn't remember me at all.
- I do too!
Okay, let's see if we can find
something sweet inside.
You wouldn't be Cable, would you?
Word was you got yourself dead
at Bryce's Crossroads.
Used to be nobody gave
two nickels about me.
I'll buy you a drink.
Name's Janroe.
I want you to know...
...you've got a friend
in Edward Janroe.
That's neighborly of you.
Thank you, Luz.
I may be the only friend
you got around here.
Nobody knows I fought
with Kirby-Smith.
Maybe it's nobody's business.
I lost the use of this arm
outside of Richmond.
- That should be of interest to you.
- Why's that?
Because we're comrades-in-arms.
I mean, good God, man, I can help you.
Because the Kidstons...
...are gonna kill you.
I don't need any help.
So Cable just rode up one sunny day
with no warning?
He caught my attention.
Who is this man Janroe?
Says he's Denaman's cousin.
Mr. Denaman left half the store to him
and half to Manuel and me.
How is your brother?
Manuel is fine.
- There are some men living in your house.
- Then they're gonna have to move out.
You know, the Union Army
is the only law around here.
Then the Yankee cavalry's gonna line up
with the ranchers supplying them...
...with the remounts, don't you think?
Yeah, I think that could be right.
Thanks for the drink.
You folks need anything, I'm here.
Luz...
Take care.
Did Luz say where Manuel was?
Only that he was coming back
from Mexico tonight with supplies.
This is our valley.
Here, hold these.
About 30 head, and two men with them.
Got a plan?
Well, son, I'm just gonna knock on
the front door and tell them we're home.
Can I look?
Not now.
Any problems?
Any problems?
They want two crates next time.
Ambition's gonna kill that Mexican.
No!
I said, no!
Go away!
- I don't like you.
- I'll give you a dollar.
A dollar don't give you the right
to hurt me.
Get off her.
Name's Cable, and this is my home.
Duane... He told us you was coming.
- Get your things and get out.
- That...
That don't seem sociable.
Duane said if we had
nothing else to do...
...we could kill you.
That'd be a mistake to try.
You think about it, son...
...before you pull on that hog leg.
Come on, Carlita.
I ain't armed!
- Mama!
- Stay back!
I got him!
- What's Vern gonna say?
- Tell him how it happened.
He'll understand. Tomorrow morning,
I'll drive your stock over to your spread.
You'd best not be coming back
here again.
Yes, sir.
- Where's Mama?
- She's down by the water. She's fine.
Now go back inside like I told you.
Martha...
You knew they were gonna
try to kill you.
I figured they might.
You became a killer, and now I'm one.
- Did you have a choice?
- Do I have one now?
You haven't stopped snarling
since I come home.
Well, you're not the man I married.
I am not the only soldier
who served in a losing cause...
...and you are not the only woman
to lose a child.
You think that's what this is about?
They're asleep.
Think they're gonna be back tonight?
No, I don't.
I had a dream about the day
you asked me to marry you.
- You asked me.
- I said it was a dream.
Daddy said I was too old...
...too skinny and too mean.
You said:
"Gonna trade some horses
down in Mexico. Wanna go along?"
I took that as a proposal.
You remember when...
...Sonny West gave me
a good shellacking...
...and you gave him a black eye...
...and you knocked out his front tooth?
You went to his father, and you said:
"Cable's got no ma. He's got no granny.
And if Sonny ever touches him again...
...I'm gonna shoot him dead."
Tonight I shot two people dead.
It's just the wind.
Pride and Prejudice.
Luxuries we can't afford.
I never read a book in my life.
I couldn't even write my own name
till you taught me.
You're smart enough.
Martha...
...an army of Rebs are coming home.
Are they all strangers like us?
I know one thing.
I don't wanna live with a woman
who don't like me.
Think on it.
If that's the way it is...
...I'll take you back to Texas.
I tried to remember everything
you taught me.
You remembered what I taught you
and more.
Sorry I missed it.
But I'm real proud of you, daughter.
Settle down.
- Move it, boy.
- They're coming round.
We'll reach Fort Lowell
by noon tomorrow.
Isn't that Bill Dancy?
Nobody rides that hard with good news.
Is it Apaches? It certainly ain't payday.
They're dead, Mr. Kidston.
Royce and Joe Bob got blowed to hell.
Come here as quick as I could.
- What happened?
- Well, we was drinking.
And having a good time.
And Joe Bob, he got a little rough
with Carlita. And then Cable showed up.
You were drunk.
I can smell it from here.
Well, then Joe Bob, he sort of tore
Carlita's dress.
So Cable shows up and shoots
both of them...
...because Joe Bob tore
some whore's dress.
Well, I don't remember everything.
I did have a few drinks.
Think on it, Bill.
Then Cable told us to get out.
- And then what?
- Well, they drew iron, that's what.
That's when the woman come out with
a scattergun and unloaded both barrels.
You mean Cable's wife
shot Royce and Joe Bob?
- Yes, sir.
- Two drunks trying...
...to murder her husband.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Lorraine.
Why didn't he kill you?
Because I didn't have my gun.
We gotta do something, Mr. Kidston.
Oh, I'm gonna do something.
Tomorrow I'm gonna sell these mustangs
at Fort Lowell.
And then I'm gonna take a bath,
eat a steak and smoke a cigar.
Austin was right.
Do you wanna just bushwhack Cable
or murder his family?
To me, it's six of one,
half a dozen for the other.
- "And Enosh lived..."
- It's Enoch.
"And Enoch lived 90 years and...
...begat Canaan. And Enoch lived...
...after he begat Canaan...
...815 years and begat sons...
...and daughters."
- That's wonderful.
What's "begat" mean, Mama?
- It means "fathered."
- Nobody lives 815 years.
It's just a story, honey.
- How many heifers are you gonna buy?
- Daddy's gonna buy 1000 head.
More like 50, but I like your confidence.
We don't have enough grass
for 1000 head.
Fifty head's a good start.
Can't I have my supper without hearing
a plot to commit murder?
He's gotta pay for what he done.
Who would've thought one ex-soldier
would be such an obstacle.
Well, Cable was a hard twist.
His war is lost.
All he's got is his place and his family.
His wife leaving him
might take the starch right out of him.
You learn to fight dirty
at that fancy school in Philadelphia?
From Duane.
What's the difference between
caliber and gauge?
The caliber is the size of the bore.
It's the diameter of the inside
of the barrel expressed in inches.
For instance, the Sharps
is a.52 caliber.
- So it's 52 one-hundredths of an inch?
- Exactly.
Morning, Mrs. Cable.
Mr. Janroe.
Just thought you must be running low
on sugar and coffee about now.
So we thought we'd come on over.
- Where's your husband?
- Around the side of the house.
What did you bring us, Miss Luz?
- Hi, Miss Luz.
- Hi.
Mr. Cable.
Luz tells me that you sold your stock
down in Mexico before you pulled out.
- And I'm fixing to buy them back.
- Well, good.
I'm glad you're able to do that.
Cable, listen.
I'm sure you're wondering about
my interest in your affairs yesterday.
Well, I seem to be sort of...
...the prize bull
around these parts lately.
Yeah, well, there was a purpose.
Did you know Denaman was running
guns for the South?
Confederate agents bring them across
the border where we pick them up.
The store is just a relay point.
And we ship them back east.
And where do you fit in?
I'm the chief agent
for Arizona Territory.
Well, that ought to keep you busy.
- Mr. Cable, let me get right to the point.
- That would be good.
Your country needs you.
You're still a Confederate soldier.
If I still believed in this war,
which I don't...
...I wouldn't have nothing to do
with running guns.
What do you mean, if you believe?
The war's over. Lee's beat six ways
from Dixie. And he knows it.
Even if you don't.
Daddy! The mare's down.
Down by the rocks in the creek.
Go get your ma.
Mama, come quick.
Daddy needs your help.
The mare's down.
Come on, I'll show you.
Get back.
Hello, Cable.
You wanna lose that?
We figured you'd come sooner or later.
- What do you want?
- Justice. And we're gonna find it.
At the long end of a rope.
You killed our brother.
But it ain't polite to hang a lady.
So we're gonna
hang your husband instead.
Get out of here.
Go on, get out of here.
Look out, Austin.
No, no, no.
Get up.
Don't shoot me, Wynn.
Wynn!
Is he dead?
- I hope so.
- You gonna shoot this one?
Clare, take your brother back
to the house. Now. Go on, Davis.
In the morning...
...I'll take you in to Denaman's.
You'll be safe there.
And when the dust clears,
I'll put you on a stage to El Paso.
When the dust clears...
...you're gonna be just like him.
I'll take my chances.
It ain't up to you.
Mr. Janroe...
...I could use some help.
We had a little problem yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if my family
could stay here a few days.
Happy to oblige.
I'd like to show you something.
- I don't see why we can't stay together.
- Till Daddy kills the blue-bellies...
...it won't be safe.
- Clare!
No, no, listen to me, Cable.
These rifles are more important
than any man's life.
I admire your sense of purpose. I do.
But if you figure a few British rifles are
gonna change the outcome of the war...
We're talking about your country here,
Mr. Cable.
Don't you still hear the guns?
The screams of the wounded?
You swore an oath to
the Confederate States of America.
It's your duty to kill Vern and Duane.
A soldier's oath doesn't include murder.
Isn't that what war is? It's murder.
All wrapped up and sanctified
with a flag.
You were at Fort Pillow.
Fort Pillow wasn't war.
It was an execution.
Forrest is a butcher in a black coat.
Mr. Janroe...
...all I can do for myself and my family
is try to rebuild our lives together.
And I suggest you do the same.
You know, the Dodd brothers...
...will never forget
that you killed Joe Bob.
There's only one Dodd left.
That's why you brought
your family here.
I couldn't get a fix on that.
Well, you know, it seems to me...
...that you're serving your country.
Whether you want to or not.
I'd consider it my duty
to look after your family.
I'm gonna hold you to that.
I ain't seen Wynn and Austin
since the drive to Fort Lowell.
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen them either.
Think they tried to settle
the score with Cable?
Damn it, you're supposed
to be looking after things.
Hell, they're grown men.
I don't have a rope on them.
If they went looking for trouble,
I suspect they found it.
If you had done as I suggested
and got rid of Cable...
...we wouldn't be having
all these problems.
You figure those horses were gonna
get to Fort Lowell by themselves.
This is business. If we don't run it like a
business, we're gonna be out of business.
This war ain't gonna last forever.
Contrary to what you think.
You must be hungry.
- I don't figure you.
- It ain't hard.
Just wanna be left alone.
I got work to do.
You best be gone when I get back.
Want some coffee?
It's fresh.
Relax.
- I'm alone.
- You walk?
I was thrown. My horse ran away.
That was careless, wasn't it?
The way you're walking,
it must have been a nasty fall.
I'll probably be black and blue tomorrow.
- You want me to saddle up a mustang?
- It can wait till morning.
Now, what would your father
say about that?
You afraid of my father, Mr. Cable?
Or me?
Or yourself?
Mr. Janroe didn't do anything wrong,
did he? I mean, you share the same bed.
He's not really interested.
He pretends, but he isn't.
He's so filled with hate,
there's no room for a woman.
He's not the only one around here.
This here is an old Yankee newspaper
from Fort Lowell.
You husband served with
General Forrest, didn't he?
Did he ever bring up the incident
at Fort Pillow, Tennessee?
He doesn't talk about the war.
I don't ask him.
There was some controversy.
Mr. Janroe, why don't you just go ahead
and say it. Whatever's on your mind.
"General Nathan Bedford Forrest
stands accused...
...of executing 300 Union prisoners."
And most of them niggers.
War changed your husband, didn't it?
It does all soldiers.
I mean, I'm not making any judgment.
But it's a fact.
See, after a spell, killing...
...gets easier, almost second nature.
Why are you telling me this?
We're involved in a vital conflict
right here.
Your husband has to answer
to his true nature.
His country needs him.
- You're wrong.
- How so?
My husband's a decent man. He's not
a murderer. In or out of uniform.
Everything was fine
until my mother died.
Next thing you know, I'm living
in Washington with Duane.
It wasn't so bad when he was off
campaigning. I got to do what I wanted.
You like to do what you want,
don't you?
Doesn't everybody?
Some people do what they have to.
Well, when Duane got thrown out
of the army and came out here...
...I had to come with him.
Now if he got thrown out of the army,
why does he still wear the uniform?
Because he thinks he's General Grant.
What did your father do?
He was a mustanger, same as me.
And his father?
Same.
And your son, is he gonna be
a mustanger too?
Davis?
Nope, he's gonna get an education.
He's gonna make a living
with his head, not his back.
Martha will see to that.
Want some more coffee?
I got a question for you.
- Ask it.
- What happened to your limp?
You're bored.
You're looking for trouble.
I took a bath last night.
I know you like me.
Sure, I like you.
But it don't make it right.
Later on tonight, you'll be sorry.
I'm already sorry.
Morning.
Send Lorraine on out here.
You're pretty free and easy
with my daughter's reputation.
Mr. Cable was a perfect gentleman.
My honor's intact.
Unfortunately.
In any event, a gun battle to reclaim
my reputation would be gratuitous.
Get on.
But I've made a very nice breakfast.
Lorraine.
You got two days to move on.
You keep your stock off my land.
I got cattle coming in.
Well, if that's the case...
...I'll kill you myself.
Thanks for the very nice breakfast.
Look at this.
It's over!
It's over.
- What you talking about?
- What's over?
The war. The war's over.
In Hidalgo, everybody knows.
- It's on the front page.
- This is a lie.
- They told me to come tell you.
- How can they be sure?
- The telegraph doesn't lie.
- Who put you up to this?
Mr. Janroe!
Wars don't just end like this.
How do they end?
There's some warning.
Days, weeks before they end.
This is Arizona Territory.
We're not in Richmond.
This could be a Yankee trick.
Anybody can send a wire.
For what gain?
Luz, can I take your horse?
No, no. I'll tell Cable.
I'm going out that way anyway.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- This is good news, Mama.
- Who won?
For a man with a price on his head,
you're a bit careless, Cable.
I could've shot you back around
the bend. Your horse threw a shoe.
A blind man could find you in the dark.
Vern Kidston ain't gonna like you
running his horses.
- I'll need the grass.
- For what?
I see no overalls. You ain't no farmer.
I don't see no cattle.
Well, you will.
When you ride down to Nogales
and buy them.
Maybe Kidston will kill you
before I return.
Then sell the cattle and give
the money to Martha.
Maybe I keep the money.
Then enjoy yourself.
Cable?
Cable?
Cable!
It's over.
Maybe the Kidstons won't be
so angry anymore. You can stay.
Maybe Janroe will go back
to where he came from.
Looks like my husband's gold.
This...
This is not gold.
This is some cows and a young bull who
knows how to take care of business.
Is he all right?
Cable? He's all right.
Cable is always all right.
Evening, major.
- Who's there?
- Edward Janroe.
Didn't mean to startle you.
You didn't startle me.
You all alone here?
My daughter's sleeping in the house.
I suppose you've heard the news.
It's only gossip.
Nope. No, sir.
"Robert E. Lee surrendered the army
of Virginia to General Grant."
That is not gossip. That is fact.
Facts have a way of changing,
depending on who's issuing them.
The smoke and smell of Chancellorsville
are in my heart tonight.
I drink to all those brave men
who died there.
You'd understand, if you'd served.
I didn't lose the use of this arm
falling off a barstool.
I fought with Kirby-Smith.
You and Cable.
Well, you may have been
a soldier once...
...but you're just a grocery clerk now.
Underneath the store,
I got two dozen cases of Enfields.
Sir, I advise you to turn them in...
...to the authorities at Fort Lowell,
or face arrest.
Nobody's gonna arrest me, because
nobody knows about them rifles...
...except you.
Give it up, Janroe.
Go on home.
See, I don't believe you understand.
I understand I am talking to a man...
...who is not in complete control
of his faculties.
People gonna think Cable shot you,
for wrecking his house.
That's for General Sherman.
That's for Mr. Lincoln.
I'm sorry about your father.
We know who did it?
I was sleeping. I heard two shots.
By the time I got to him,
no one was there.
Who would it be if it wasn't Cable?
Who else had any reason?
Cable might have done it,
but it seems like we ought to be sure.
And we're not sure. That's the thing.
I'm sure as I need to be.
Mr. Kidston, I don't believe
Cable killed Duane.
Cable killed both my brothers,
but they were fair fights.
He could have killed me, and nobody
would've said "by your leave."
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.
I had two brothers. Now I got none.
I got a mother in Kansas.
Well, you're a good hand, Austin.
Thank you.
This morning Mr. Kidston and three riders
headed out to your place.
It wasn't social.
Why?
Some fellow rode up to the house last
night and pumped two slugs into Duane.
Killed him for sure.
Vern believes Cable did it.
How come you're not with them?
There's something wrong
with this valley.
The war's over,
but the killing don't stop.
- Luz?
- Don't worry.
I'll take care of the children.
Going out there's gonna make matters
worse. You'll get yourself shot.
I'll kill you if I have to.
You never told Cable the war's over.
He wasn't there.
Who killed Duane Kidston?
It was you.
We have work to do.
Hello, the house!
Sorry I missed you last night.
Put the gun down.
You tore up my house.
Put it down.
When you get off my land.
There's still law in this territory.
If you wanna come along peacefully,
I give you my word we won't shoot.
I got no business at Fort Lowell.
Well, you visited Duane last night.
We're returning the call.
I never left here last night.
You killed Duane. Shot him twice.
If I did, I'd remember.
You liar!
Vern!
Vern!
I could kill you anytime.
I could've killed you
yesterday with Manuel.
Why didn't you?
I'm not sure.
If my husband killed your brother,
he'd tell you straight out.
He knew the war was over.
He killed Duane anyway.
Is that true?
Nobody told me the war is over.
Janroe rode out here yesterday
to tell you.
Janroe came here?
I guess he paid us both a visit.
The children are at the store.
Janroe's there.
Clare? Davis?
- Where's Janroe?
- Ain't nobody seen him.
He was gone when I got here.
Clare? Davis?
Mama!
Davis, where's your sister?
He took her.
Did Janroe shoot Luz?
Luz said he wasn't taking us anywhere.
Mr. Janroe shot her dead.
The rifles.
The wagon's gone.
He took the Enfields. All of them.
He needs Clare to help with the four-up.
- Rebs use San Pablo for trading.
- He'll sell the rifles there.
I'm going with you.
Duane's dead.
Your girl's alive. I'm going with you.
Go.
You go inside, okay?
I can't lose another child.
Four-up. Deep grooves.
Gotta be him.
You're gonna kill these horses.
Better them than me.
He's got three riders with him.
Cable, we're gonna
get your daughter back.
Daddy!
Undo the lines, Clare!
Daddy!
- Jump, darling!
- I can't!
Clare, I said, jump!
Jump!
We've got company.
Will you take my daughter...
...back to her mother?
- Yeah.
- I wanna stay with you!
Hey, hombre!
Here's the deal.
You take the rifles and leave.
Let's end this.
No, no, no. You kill our friend.
Hombre, I think that we kill you.
Then we take the rifles.
That is the deal.
Oh, well.
Hombre!
Hombre!
We will take the rifles.
Don't shoot no more!
- Your daddy told me to get you home.
- I'm not going!
Clare?
Daddy!
Daddy, you're hurt.
I'm fine, darling.
Get on.
She wasn't going nowhere
till you showed.
Vern...
...I'll always be grateful
for what you done.
Well, I made more than my share
of mistakes.
Glad it worked out.
How bad is that?
Let's go.
- Mama!
- Oh, Clare!
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
But Daddy's hurt.
Thanks for helping my dad.
Glad I could, son.
Clare said you and Mr. Kidston
could've put Sir Lancelot to shame.
What spread's he work for?
We all owe Vern.
Maybe we can all live here
in peace now.
You talking about the war between
the states, or the war between us?
The disadvantage
of knowing a man all his life...
...is a woman never
expects him to change.
And when he does, it rattles her.
I can't remember when
the Cable you knew died.
Tell me about Fort Pillow.
All men sin.
Especially in war.
But we slaughtered unarmed prisoners.
They wore Yankee blue,
and we gunned them down like dogs.
You didn't shoot unarmed men.
No.
But l...
I couldn't do anything to stop it.
Mary died, and I couldn't do anything
to stop it.
We don't control our lives.
We pretend we do.
But it's self-deception.
With all my strength I reached out
for my child, but she slipped away.
So I blamed myself.
And when that wore out, I blamed you.
If there wasn't a war and you were beside
Mary's bed, she still would have died.
I don't know why I went to war.
Maybe I'll never know.
But I do know this:
There wasn't a day gone by I did not
regret leaving you and the children.
And it's important to me
that you know that.
It's important to me that you said it.
So where's that leave us?
We let the war and Mary sleep.
And nature can do the rest.
