-What on earth is he doing?
-lt's called bulldogging, ma'am.
That's Bulldog Burnett.
He works for my outfit.
lt's a perfectly silly way
to handle cattle, if you ask me.
My name is Charles Ellsworth.
l can tell by your speech
that you're from England.
May l ask what has brought you
to our fair shore?
-A ship.
-Hilary.
We brought some cattle over.
We're from Herefordshire.
lf you'll excuse us, please.
Come along, Hilary.
l know a countryman of yours.
John Taylor. You should meet him.
He has a spread next to ours.
He bested you again, Simons.
Them critters Burnett draws...
lay down and
roll over when they see him coming.
Being's as how l probably bulldogged
their pas...
they know what to expect.
SAM: You're next, Sagamon.
SAGAMON: Right.
GERT: Sam. Look who's here.
Jeff, how are you? Hi, Gert.
Jeff, it's been a long time.
More than a year
since he caught that horn.
But l ain't through
punching cows yet.
Not by a long shot.
Taylor said he took care of things.
He promised a lot of things.
All Jeff got was $40
and a ticket to St. Louis.
Formerly of England,
and now from Texas, Mr. John Taylor.
How do you do?
Mr. Ellsworth tells me
you brought these Herefords over.
lf Mr. Evans is about,
l'd like to talk to him about them.
My husband was killed
in an accident aboard ship.
l'm deeply sorry, ma'am.
But it's indeed a blessing to find
someone at last who knows Herefords.
MARTHA: They were bid in yesterday.
HlLARY: By a dairy farmer.
What we were paid
hardly covered our transportation.
MARTHA: Let's show them Vindicator, Hilary.
lt's all right.
Vindicator's really very gentle.
My daughter has a special affection
for Vindicator. She raised him.
Are you going
to sell that bull, Mrs. Evans?
l'm afraid l must.
We need the money.
He'll be auctioned at noon today.
You won't find much market
for that muley bull here.
Muley?
Why, your bull has no horns.
Mr. Ellsworth, Vindicator's lack
of horns is a product of breeding...
and it is not a freak condition.
Please, ladies, l didn't intend
to start an argument.
My partner Alex Bowen
raises the cattle and ships to me.
l see. A butcher.
Hilary, please.
One morning you'll wake up
to a train whistle...
and there won't be any more
cattle drives.
Yes, sir, in a few years
it'll all be gone.
Leastwise, the way we knew it.
Don't start faulting what
you can't stand up to, Harter...
just 'cause you're finished.
l've still got a hoot and a holler
left in me.
Sure. lf somebody buys you a bottle.
SAM: Now wait a minute, Simons.
Here's a man that broke most of
the trails you're riding today.
Man?
All l see is a deadbeat on crutches.
She's no better.
Watch your wallets, men.
She'll put the bite on you for sure.
Close the gate.
-Mabry, get in there and stop them.
-Yes, sir.
Can't somebody put a stop to this?
lt's all right, ma'am,
l'll protect you.
Don't you worry about that bull.
l'll see that you get a good price.
Here, get off my bull.
Excuse me, ma'am.
-Our bull is loose.
-Don't worry, ma'am, l'll get him.
MAN: Missed the horns, Burnett.
WOMAN #1 : Slipped out from under him.
WOMAN #2: He tried to dog a muley.
SAM: Look out, miss,
he's headed this way.
You're the one
that has to be looked out for.
What kind of a bull is that?
Thank you, Mr. Burnett.
You all right, Sam?
Thanks, Gert.
You can't bulldog
a bull that doesn't have any horns.
l didn't break anything,
just chipped my pride, l guess.
That seems to hurt worse
than anything, don't it, Sam?
l'll kill Burnett.
From now on, Mabry here is top hand.
You'll take orders from him.
You'll notice the hornless condition
being an innovation...
that should meet with the approval
of each and every one...
who must move or ship cattle.
Mother, if that butcher bids,
l'll die.
Now, really, Hilary
you must learn to trust people more.
l had a long talk
with Mr. Ellsworth...
and he assured me that he'll be
bidding for his partner in Texas.
Mr. Bowen is extremely interested
in improving his stock.
Now, who will start the bidding?
$700.
AUCTlONEER: $700 is bid
by Mr. Charles Ellsworth.
$900 for the lovely ladies
from England.
lf she'd had an elephant up there...
Ellsworth would have bid
on that, too.
TAYLOR: $1,000.
AUCTlONEER: $1,000 from Taylor of Texas.
$1,100.
Don't go away, Sam,
l've got a job for you.
Bowen doesn't want that muley bull.
$1,100 from Mr. Ellsworth on behalf
of Mr. Alex Bowen of Texas.
-$1,200.
-$1,500.
AUCTlONEER: $1,500 from that....
SAM: Have you lost your mind?
$1,600.
ELLSWORTH: $2,000.
AUCTlONEER: $2,000 is bid.
AUCTlONEER: lf you will
kindly step forward...
for your signatures
on the bill of sale.
Get that bull on the Dodge City
train tonight and get it to Bowen.
l'm not taking
that knob head anywhere.
l'm working for Bowen, not you.
You won't be working
for anyone if you keep talking.
That suits me just fine.
You get yourself another man.
l quit.
There goes Bulldog Burnett.
Just a cowpoke, miss.
Long on muscle, short on brains.
l'll get a good hand
to take Vindicator west.
You can depend on that.
l'm sure l can, Mr. Ellsworth.
Suppose you drop
round the hotel this afternoon...
and pick up your money.
22.
l've got a business deal for you.
Same kind of deal
you handed Jeff Harter?
l'll give you $500 for that bull.
lt's not mine to sell.
Bowen doesn't want it
and neither does Ellsworth.
But l do,
and l'm willing to pay for it.
Ellsworth paid $2,000 for it.
l'm buying a bull,
not female companionship.
All right, l'll go $1,000.
l'll have Mabry and Simons
take the noon train to Dodge...
and meet you there tomorrow.
All right, l'll deliver it.
Coming, dear lady.
ELLSWORTH: You quit.
SAM: l want to talk to you about that.
Well, get to it.
l've decided to deliver
that bull to Bowen.
All right, fine.
You get it out of town and
don't bother me about it anymore.
Now look, Sam, be short, be polite,
and then be on your way.
Mr. Burnett is just leaving
to put Vindicator on the train.
Have a good trip, Sam.
MARTHA: Then you've changed your opinion
about Vindicator?
Well, no, ma'am.
l just thought l'd enjoy the trip
hearing them cattlemen laugh...
about that animal
all the way to Dodge.
l'm sure Mr. Bowen won't laugh.
That bull is a thing
that might tickle him a good deal.
ELLSWORTH: Give my regards to Bowen.
Have a good trip.
And now, my dear Mrs. Evans...
shall we conclude
our little business?
This calls for champagne.
Meatpacking Romeo.
When that $2,000 is gone,
Martha, you can tap me for more.
l'm going to lay St. Louis
at your feet.
l'm afraid
there won't be time for that.
You see, Hilary and l are leaving
for England tonight.
ELLSWORTH: But you can't be serious.
l can do a lot for you.
l already have.
Mr. Ellsworth,
l realise that a woman alone...
has to expect some nonsense
from the adventurous male...
but l sold you a Hereford bull,
nothing more.
l buy beef for 10 cents a pound.
l know companionship comes higher.
l'm giving you your money back.
There is no sale.
lt's too late for that.
l'm the legal owner of that bull.
You said that Vindicator would be
delivered to your partner.
That was the condition of the sale.
You run out on me,
and your bull will end up...
-on that table tomorrow night.
-He will not.
Vindicator will be used for breeding
in Texas. l shall see to that.
lt's getting around train time.
l still have to load that darn bull.
-lt might take a little doing.
-Sure would.
Here's a kind of a mash note.
Don't let Jeff read it. l always did
try and steal his girl.
l'll see you next year.
Mash note?
Why, Sam was always so woman-shy...
it took a team
just to drag him into a dance.
$1,000?
Come on, you big, red,
no-horned brute, get up.
Hello, Mr. Burnett.
-Here now, there's been a mistake.
-A mistake?
You're not supposed to be....
You're on the wrong train.
-lt's going to Dodge City, isn't it?
-Yes, it's going--
Then we're on the right train,
Mr. Burnett.
We're going to the Bowen Ranch
with you and Vindicator.
Well, that's just about
as crazy an idea...
as you walking all the way up
here on top of this train.
You just did that, didn't you?
How are you getting along
with Vindicator?
l'm not getting along
with him at all.
He's a useless hunk of gristle, and
besides, he's lying on my blankets.
Vindicator is not useless.
He'll certainly improve those
scrubby old longhorns of yours.
Why, he's so handsome, the cows will
fight to present themselves to him.
Now, what kind of talk is that?
What kind of a thing
is that for a young lady to say?
The facts of life
are no mystery to me, Mr. Burnett.
After all,
l am a cattle breeder's daughter.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
My father taught me
to talk about such things.
Bloodlines and breeding
were decent topics in our house.
Nobody said anything
about your father.
l was just.... What's the idea,
crashing in here on me like this?
There's nothing sacred
about a cattle car.
This one happens to be my bedroom.
And you have not been invited
in here.
Now, come on, you bison belly,
l'm gonna teach you how to behave.
Come on, get up.
Don't you dare kick
a helpless animal.
And Vindicator doesn't appreciate
name-calling, either.
You mean l've hurt his feelings?
HlLARY: l mean Vindicator's lineage...
is traceable back to James l.
Which is a great deal
better than you can do, l'm sure.
Why, he's practically royalty.
And you might as well learn
how to handle him properly.
Listen to me, if you please.
There you are.
Now you may try it, Mr. Burnett.
-Now, hold on.
l have my rights.
l'm not gonna whistle a tune
for any royal, James l, muley bull.
Now, you get back up
this ladder here.
SAM: l'll help you.
HlLARY: l don't need your help, thank you.
The female is no less agile
than the male.
That's right, young lady. Goodbye.
Holy Moses.
Come on, get down off here,
before you fall and break your neck.
Careful now.
PORTER: Mrs. Evans, your berths are ready.
MARTHA: Thank you.
There's Mr. Burnett.
Run along to bed, Hilary.
l want to have a talk
with Mr. Burnett.
You're wasting your time, Mother.
He's obstinate, ill-tempered,
and quite lacking in education.
Perhaps. But he does
have a rough intelligence...
which could be refined,
don't you think?
Don't be long, Mother.
Now, really, Mr. Burnett,
l don't bite.
-Man overboard.
-Hold it, ma'am.
Mr. Burnett, l am sorry.
No, ma'am.
l might jump, l'd never fall.
Of course.
Now, Mr. Burnett,
since we're travelling together...
l see no point
in our avoiding each other.
-There are many arrangements--
-Firstly...
we're not travelling together.
We're just on the same train.
And if l was you, l'd get off.
l intend to deliver Vindicator
personally to Mr. Bowen.
l'm doing that for Ellsworth,
and you don't figure in it at all.
Now, my advice to you is to get
the first train back to St. Louis...
and then get on home,
where you belong.
Mr. Burnett,
you may bulldog a steer...
but you cannot bulldog me.
Vindicator represents generations
of selective breeding...
and l intend to see
he's properly placed.
Now, please, ma'am.
l've had all the breeding
l can take for one day.
The thing l'm trying to get over to
you is that this trip's dangerous.
There's no telling
what might happen to you in Dodge.
Surely our lives
will be safe in your hands.
l don't want your lives in my hands.
l've got enough trouble with my own.
The thing for you to do
is turn back at Dodge...
and trust me to deliver
that bull of yours.
Mr. Burnett, you will either act
as our guide to the Bowen Ranch...
or l will get someone else.
Good night, sir.
Would you get our baggage, please?
-ls there something wrong?
-Why, no, ma'am.
SlMONS: Come on, you stupid....
You fellows are gonna wreck
this whole deal.
You don't know these two women
l've got on my neck.
They're bound and determined to come
with me the whole way to Bowen's.
They got paid $2,000 for this bull,
so they're out of it. Come on.
You horn in now,
they'll call the Sheriff.
SlMONS: You horn in, l'll call him.
Now hold on, both of you.
This whole thing is shady
all the way around.
All l want is the bull.
And you'll get it.
l'll meet you over at the saloon.
We'll work something out.
All right. Come on, Simons.
All right. But don't make me have to
come looking for you, Burnett.
Give me 20 minutes, l'll be there.
HlLARY: All you have to do is whistle,
Mr. Burnett.
SAM: What are you doing here?
HlLARY: l thought you might need help.
But l see you've had some.
Why, that's excellent, Mr. Burnett.
You've learned
to handle him very well.
Vindicator, you're a fickle-hearted
muley bull.
l'm afraid Hilary is jealous,
Mr. Burnett.
How soon can we be on our way?
l've got to get a wagon and
all sorts of supplies and horses.
Yes, of course.
But that won't take very long.
l've asked the baggage man
to take our things to the hotel.
So we'll wait there for you.
Ma'am, l don't think you ought
to be so dead set on this trip.
But l am dead set.
So let's not waste the day in talk.
HlLARY: ...one of them say
it was a shady deal all round.
-Mother, you haven't been listening.
-Of course l have, dear.
HlLARY: We should go to the Sheriff...
and have Mr. Burnett thrown
into the hoosegow.
-The what?
-The jail, jug, old Bailey.
Why on earth should we do
a thing like that?
Because they plan
to kidnap Vindicator...
and Mr. Burnett
is in cahoots with them.
What is this cahoots?
lt sounds awful.
Conspiracy. Anyway,
he said he'd meet them in the pub.
lt has something to do
with that Mr. Taylor.
Hilary, Mr. Taylor is an Englishman.
So was Captain Kidd. Come on.
lf we can find them, l'll show you.
SAM: Wait a minute, Simons,
you go out on that street...
and we'll all go to jail.
Give us another drink.
l don't want your whisky.
Come on, Mabry.
l'm not letting those women
ride away with that bull.
We're going straight through
Taylor's place.
l'll stake that bull
out at Sand Creek.
You come in at night and take him,
l'll say he strayed off.
You're just gonna stir things
up here.
You bet l am.
You two women go over to the wagon.
l've got a little business
to attend to here.
l'll be with you directly.
Does that look
like a conspiracy to you?
The thieves have fallen out.
l'm giving the orders here, Simons.
l said, quit it.
Just look at that.
Those ruffians.
Stop this at once.
This is too much. Drop that gun.
How dare you hit that man.
He was gonna shoot me.
Now, really, Mr. Burnett, you have
a predisposition to violence...
-of which l heartily disapprove.
-Yes, ma'am.
Now, let's be on our way
before you cause more trouble.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Come along, Hilary.
SAM: Excuse me, ma'am, you're on my hat.
l see what
you're up against, all right.
Sand Creek, day after tomorrow.
And that bull better be there.
Very well, Mr. Burnett,
if you are ready.
That horse is
a little hard to handle, ma'am.
,
We have ridden on occasion,
Mr. Burnett.
Just one thing, ma'am...
if you're dead set
on making this trip to Texas...
you're going the wrong way.
Thank you, Mr. Burnett.
-You are a very capable guide.
-l can tell north from south.
Now, if you'll just....
SAM: Where you been, ma'am?
The only thing l concede
is that you had the better horse.
SAM: We'll swap off and do it again.
Thank you, Sam.
Hilary, would you like to ride
a little while?
No, thank you, Mother.
l'll just drive along...
just drive while you two consort.
Really, Hilary, do you call
an innocent canter consorting?
No, but l call
a half-a-day gallop a romp.
MARTHA: What do you think now,
Mr. Burnett, of Vindicator's ability to travel?
He's doing all right.
As well as a longhorn,
would you say?
lt's hard to say.
ln winter, the cattle have to travel
a good bit looking for feed...
and in summers, every once
in a while there's a drought.
A few wells and catch basins
would solve that problem.
Alex Bowen's not gonna change...
the countryside
to accommodate one bull.
Mr. Bowen cannot stop progress.
One day this whole range...
will be occupied by
white-faced Hereford cattle.
You'll see it happen.
SAM: l hung onto his horns,
and that fool steer ran a mile...
me flapping like laundry
in a high wind.
Finally, he stopped,
and looked at me real sorrowful...
and then he just flopped down,
disgusted.
And you were only 16?
And from that time on,
they took to calling me Bulldog.
From what l saw, things don't seem
to have changed very much.
Here, l'll get you some more coffee.
-You all right?
-Yes, and you?
lf anyone's interested,
Vindicator and l are all right, too.
Must've been a stray shot.
Funny that a stray shot should
just happen to hit our coffee pot.
Now, Miss Hilary, don't start
dreaming up any more trouble.
l think we'd better all turn in.
Got to be up before daybreak.
Come on.
l'll take care of Vindicator.
Did you fire that shot?
l was just reminding Burnett
to show up at Sand Creek.
l told you once,
and l'm telling you again...
l'll handle this.
Mabry, out here
you ain't telling me nothing.
HlLARY: There's your saddle.
-Thank you. Your mother up?
-No.
l just thought l'd help you
on your way.
What's gotten into you now?
Come now.
That shot was a signal
from Taylor's men.
You're taking Vindicator to them.
You're dead wrong.
l was just gonna get you up.
HlLARY: l just bet you were.
l was and l am.
Time to get up, ma'am.
Come on, roust out.
HlLARY: lf you have any decency, you'll go.
Vindicator will be better off
with Taylor...
and my mother can certainly
do without you.
-Hilary. What on earth--
-l know what you're up to.
You've decided to play
Mr. Ellsworth's game.
-He certainly is not like him.
-No?
One was willing to buy a bull
he didn't want...
the other to sell one he didn't own.
lt's just the same.
You can't see it
because you don't want to.
Sam, is there any truth in this?
Mother, l know what l heard.
l'm just telling you
l got up to get an early start.
What you heard in Dodge
doesn't have anything to do with us.
You're calling me a liar.
l'm just saying
that you misunderstood something...
and imagined more.
l suppose l only imagine...
that you're trying to win
my mother's affections?
Hilary, that question
is most certainly not to the point.
lt's the whole point, Mother.
Vindicator is
going to be delivered to Alex Bowen.
And the sooner we move,
the sooner we'll get there.
Very well, Sam. Let's move.
SAM: All right, hold up.
Give me the axe behind the seat.
Wire.
They'll wire the whole world.
Telegraph wire...
barbed wire.
This must be private property.
There's always been free passage
across this range.
Taylor may own these sections,
he's got no right to wire them.
Do you mean that we're going
onto Taylor's ranch?
We're leaving it.
,
SAM: Let's make time.
MARTHA: Are you satisfied now, Hilary?
l am.
They ought to be moving
into Bosquo Canyon about now.
Burnett had no intention of stopping
at Sand Creek.
We better go tell Taylor.
SlMONS: You're all through telling, Mabry.
There's $3,000 waiting for me
in that canyon.
lt'll get me all the way to Mexico.
You're getting off right here.
You're crazy, Simons.
Put that gun away.
Start running.
-Mother.
-Yes?
-May l ride with you for a bit?
-Of course, dear.
SAM: Better keep moving along.
Few more miles
and we'll be out of this.
Cattle up in there.
MARTHA: What's that noise?
SAM: Horns.
Horns?
Cattle horns.
l'll be right back,
you follow along slow.
-Hi, Jamie.
-Hi, Sam.
-Where are you moving the stock?
-To Dodge.
l'm gonna cash them in
and be my own boss.
Bowen know about this?
Pa might miss the cattle
but he won't miss me.
l figure he owes me something
for my time.
You all alone?
No, Felipe's back there
pushing the drag.
Don't crowd them too much.
-l got some people up ahead here.
-Right.
Swing out! They're moving!
Come on.
Turn that wagon around.
Stay where you are. Get back.
Drop your gun right there.
Now l'll take the money
Taylor paid you for the bull.
l haven't got it.
l'll search your corpse
if that's the way you want it.
There'll be no need for that.
l'll give you the money.
How much were you paid
for Vindicator, Mr. Burnett?
SlMONS: $1,000.
What else you got in there?
Stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it!
Now, Mr. Simons,
l came by my $2,000 honestly...
so you will please
give them back to me.
Look out, Martha,
he's still got a gun.
So have l.
No, please. Let him go.
l don't want any killing.
SlMONS: Come on. Get up.
-You killed him.
-He didn't give me any choice.
A man is dead, and this boy is hurt.
All because of your dishonesty.
That's one way to see it, ma'am.
Out. There's the answer.
Take what's due and skin out.
HlLARY: Mother, can't we stop?
lt isn't much farther, dear...
and there'll be people there
to look after him.
-You'll be home soon.
-Home?
No. Where's my hat?
Estaban. Juan.
Get Jamie inside, he's hurt.
Please, lift him carefully.
Here's Jamie, Alex. He's hurt.
Aye, it doesn't surprise me.
Felipe comes stumbling in...
this afternoon
with a hole in his shoulder.
Stampede, he says.
MARTHA: Do you mean you knew your son
was in danger and didn't send help?
Madam, l knew he'd either
make it back alive or he would not.
ln this part of the world,
a helping hand comes too late.
What do l want?
Now, you listen to me.
Your son is hurt.
You shut your gob, woman.
Out here it's Alexander Bowen
what gives the orders...
and you womenfolk listen
to what l say. ls that clear to you?
You pompous, foul-smelling tyrant.
l want that boy moved
where he can be looked after.
Now, you and you there. Pick him up.
And, Mr. Burnett,
you can certainly help.
Don't just stand there.
Do as she says.
He's got a busted arm...
a bunch of cracked ribs,
l don't know what else.
All we can do
under these primitive conditions...
is to keep him down and hope.
l'm sorry about the place.
l'll need something for that roof
to keep the weather out.
l've taken care of that.
You have?
l told that Estaban to fix....
Undisciplined and shiftless,
the whole lot of them.
Yes, but we don't know
that about Jamie, do we?
You need this,
No, not in here. Up on the roof.
l don't want to catch the rain,
l want to keep it out.
And pass the information
on to those who ought to know...
that cleanliness
is next to godliness.
No, we don't know
about Jamie at all.
Will they be gone very long?
Maybe four, five days, maybe more.
There certainly is.
That woman has taken over my fort.
Right there.
The entire place
stinks of laundry soap.
Madam, if you do not care
to get snowed in...
l suggest that you hitch up
your wagon and head for Dodge.
l don't intend to head for anywhere
until Jamie recovers.
l'm glad to hear it.
He's feeling better
if you care to know.
And furthermore, we can't leave...
until you understand
how to take care of Vindicator.
Now, tomorrow, l would like
to go out and select some cows.
-Select?
-Yes, for breeding purposes.
Madam, out here
it's the fit that survive...
and if that creature of yours
cannot select his own cows...
he is not fit to live here.
l think it may be a good idea
if you take a wee peek...
at some of these
prospective brides...
you're figuring to match up
with that Hereford of yours.
-That's precisely my intention.
-Good.
You come on the morrow...
and l'll hunt up a longhorn cow
for you...
and then you'll see for yourself
why l think that bull of yours...
will not be the father of a calf.
lt won't be exactly the kind of
a hunt you'd expect, ma'am.
-Here, can l help with this?
-No, thank you, Mr. Burnett.
They're clean.
l'd like to keep them that way.
-Beef stew?
-Chicken broth.
Snake broth, gopher broth,
anything but chicken broth.
When do l get to eat?
-l can do that.
-Do it then.
-Sure would like something to chew.
-Chew the spoon.
Hey, you're touchy this morning.
Your father's back.
He goes off for a whole week
without saying goodbye...
then doesn't even stop in
to see how you are.
What's between you two?
You snarl and growl at each other
like two wounded animals.
lt's always been like that.
-But why?
-Hilary, don't get involved.
Don't get involved?
Jamie Bowen, if you didn't have
enough broken bones...
l'd certainly
add to your collection.
l'm surrounded by stubbornness.
Sam, Mother, your father,
and now you.
The only one l can talk to
around here is Vindicator.
l hate family mysteries.
Why does it have to be that way?
l don't know!
lf l knew, l'd tell you,
but l don't.
-l'm sorry.
-That's all right.
You're gonna stay around until l'm
back on my feet again, aren't you?
Maybe even a little longer.
Hilary, we're going out
to select some cows tomorrow.
Jamie, how are you?
Fine, Mrs. Evans.
l just had the best chicken broth
you ever tasted.
But if you find a loose cow
and could slip it past Hilary...
l'd eat it horns, hooves,
hide, everything.
BOWEN: You still think that bull of yours
could be her mate?
Mr. Bowen, Vindicator's
first calves...
will weigh half again as much
as your longhorn calves...
and they'll be hardy.
She can rip him to tatters
while he's still dancing.
-He'll never beget a calf.
-You're mistaken.
BOWEN: Madam, l've lived half my life here.
And l tell you,
if the longhorns do not kill him...
then the wolves
and the winters will.
And l suppose you agree with him?
Sometimes it gets down
to 20 below, ma'am.
You can see that beast, Mother.
A cow? Good Lord!
l believe that Vindicator
will live long enough...
on the open range to reproduce.
And that's all we can expect of him.
Mother, that's cruel.
Yes, it's cruel,
and stupid, and savage.
But then we live among
savage and stupid people.
And the only way to convince them
is on their own terms.
Survival.
That's all they understand.
We could build a shelter.
Keep him alive that way.
l can keep roses alive
in a hothouse.
And you've got
a hothouse bull, madam.
That's not so.
Vindicator does have stamina
and fighting spirit. He does.
My father bred it into him...
and if he has to risk his life
to prove it to you, then he will.
She'll not turn him loose
after what she's seen here.
Yes, she will.
You forget that my husband died...
trying to bring Herefords here
and prove this very point.
That woman does not
fear a thing, eh, Sam?
Nothing but dishonesty and dirt.
Do you think your ma
has any cold beef in the cupboard?
-Sure, Jamie.
-And my ma has tortillas.
Get out of sight! And, Conchita,
come back later with tortillas.
HlLARY: All right, Vindicator. Come on.
l like to see open sky
once in a while.
Where you taking Rosy Red?
-Don't call him that.
-l'm sorry, Hilary.
l'm taking him out,
far out on the range...
and l'm going to leave him there.
There's no point in getting yourself
all upset over an old bull.
Vindicator isn't old.
Well, l mean,
he's an animal not a person.
You are a Bowen, yes, you are.
lnsensitive and hateful.
You can't understand it
and you never will.
Come on, Vindicator.
You go along now, Vindicator...
and don't you come back,
do you hear me?
Vindicator, you've got to stand
on your own four feet. l mean it.
You're a British bull
with uncommon good sense...
and fine ancestors.
We've had some fine times together.
And prove that Father was right.
Go on.
She turned him loose.
Your lass has got guts,
l'll grant you that.
l suppose you'll be
going home now, ma'am?
What for?
l mean, what's the rush, Sam?
Mistress Evans could pay us
a wee visit for awhile.
Come summer, you'll see the first
crossbred Herefords on this range.
Sam, there's no sense
in telling her a lie.
This is longhorn country...
and it'll stay longhorn country,
madam, you cannot change it.
l meant what l said.
lf only l could believe that,
Mr. Burnett...
it might make a difference.
But l made that mistake once,
didn't l?
Martha, what l did was wrong.
l lied to you because l didn't want
you and Hilary to turn against me...
and l'm sorry.
l think l'd better go to Hilary.
Then you're not still mad at me?
No, not particularly.
You know, Jamie...
there's really nothing
to keep us here anymore, is there?
Vindicator's out there
on the range...
-and you're up and around.
-No, now, wait a minute.
l've still got cracked ribs
and they hurt like the devil.
Here, l'll show you.
See? That's painful.
l need attention.
Jamie, you're breaking my ribs.
Yeah.
And l will, too, if that's what
it's gonna take to keep you here.
Look, all l've got is the two legs
l stand on, Hilary...
but there's room in this country to
make us a place like Herefordshire.
l don't care what it's like.
l don't ever want to leave you.
BOWEN:
Don't just stand there, man,
slam the door!
SAM: What're you doing?
BOWEN: What does it look like?
You look like a bull
in a mud wallow.
Look, we got a blizzard
on our hands out there.
-The glass is still dropping.
-That's grand.
She'll not be able to travel
in such weather.
Been wondering how to keep her here
short of violence.
How do l smell, Sam?
Do l smell grand now?
-You smell like an old buffalo.
-That's not me, that's the robe.
Alex, l'm going out
and find Vindicator...
and bring him back here
until this weather lets up.
-Let nature take its course, man.
-But l can save him.
BOWEN: Who wants to save him?
After he's no more here...
Mistress Evans will see
that l was right about this place...
and then she may get
a wee glimmer...
that l can be right about
some other things.
Well, it doesn't take any brains
to let a bull die in a blizzard.
Aye, but it takes a great deal
to turn loose of the past...
and that's exactly
what l want her to do.
l want her to forget all about
Herefords, and think about me.
l made up my mind.
l'm going to wed that woman.
-You're going to wed her?
-Aye.
But, Bowen, Mrs. Evans is a lady.
She's an English lady.
She didn't come
all the way out here...
to marry
an old grizzly bear like you.
BOWEN: Yeah, she will, l tell you.
Once that bull is dead and gone,
she'll turn her attention to me:
SAM: Anything?
JUAN: That bull has vanished,
lf he's smart like you say...
he headed for the Gulf of Mexico
last week.
A man cannot find a thing
in this snow.
Listen close. Listen.
You try it.
Keep it up loud.
We'll make another swing.
Sam, tomorrow l'm going with you.
No, you're not well enough.
l've been doing cartwheels
for weeks.
SAM: lt's your job to stop their worrying.
,
CHlLDREN:
Mistress Evans.
l'm serving tea at about 4:00
this afternoon.
-l wondered if you'd care to come?
-Tea?
Why, thank you very much, Mr. Bowen.
lt could be a nice change for you.
At 4:00, then.
All right, children. Stand up now.
We're going to sing
One, two, three.
Miss Evans, good day to you.
Up and about, are you?
Do you feel sprightly enough
to run off again?
l'm through running.
l'm going to find me my own place.
That sounds easy when you say it,
but it's not.
Life out here is hard, laddie.
Yeah, well, don't do anything
to make it any softer.
What are you referring to?
Like maybe you could build
some sheds for the stock...
and lay in some winter feed
and repair this godforsaken place?
You've been listening
to that wee lassie.
You bet.
And it's the first sense l've heard
in all this part of Texas.
l'm serving tea at 4:00
this afternoon.
You may bring Miss Evans
if you care to.
The master will join you presently.
My, aren't we formal.
A Highland officer?
You do not recognise me in uniform,
do you, Jamie?
lt's the first time l've scraped
my face since l left my regiment.
Would you care to pour, Mrs. Evans?
Estaban has made us some scones.
He's quite a good cook.
Estaban, you scoundrel.
l thought you were 100 years
older than Sam.
Approve of the change, do you?
The trouble with appearances,
Mr. Bowen...
is while beauty is skin deep...
meanness runs all the way through.
What's that you're saying?
She's saying
that bagpipes and tea...
don't erase the way
you've treated Jamie.
l did the best l could, lassie.
And l could not help it if he
did not have a mother's tender care.
All these years
you've hardly ever spoken to him.
lt does not suit my purpose
to discuss the past.
-You mean my mother?
-Aye.
Now, what could l have
said to you, Jamie?
She was ailing when you were born...
and she died.
or your husband.
Mistress Evans...
you've captured my entire fort
and all of its inhabitants.
You've got them eating
out of your wee hand.
Aye, it's true.
Now you've made attachments here
yourself, dear lady.
l just wish.... l mean...
l've been hoping that you could
find it in your heart to...
make a similar attachment to me.
Given a wee while, of course.
l wouldn't want to rush you.
And l want you to think about
making your home here in Texas.
You and your lassie.
She likes it here
by the looks of things.
is that could be such a grand life
for us all.
lt would never be
like Herefordshire.
Aye, and it's not
like Scotland, either.
But when l first came here,
l made up my mind...
l was going to accept the land
as l found it.
That's what you must do
because you cannot change it.
And if you're still thinking
that l'm responsible...
because Hereford cattle cannot
adapt themselves to Texas...
and that l shattered...
that lovely dream you shared
with your husband, that's not true.
You cannot live with dreams.
lt's time to stop dreaming
and live for this day...
and the next day.
Time for me to admit
that this is longhorn country...
and that you're its lord and master.
A man in love is not even lord
nor master of himself.
l'd like to change the climate
for you, if l could.
What are you looking at, man?
ls that you,  Bowen?
No, l'm Bonnie Prince ruddy Charlie.
BOWEN: What do you want?
JUAN: l lost touch with him.
BOWEN: With who?
JUAN:  Burnett.
l could hear him whistling,
but he was gone...
l could not find him.
The snow was too heavy.
ls he lost?
No, , maybe he has troubles...
but  Burnett is not lost.
Fetch the men. Go on with you.
BOWEN: Saddle my horse.
JAMlE: l'll come, too.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
l have been wondering for years...
what you were hiding
behind that beard of yours.
l told you before, a man can change.
All right, you've changed.
l'm sure Mrs. Evans approves.
Well, l haven't changed.
That Hereford bull's out here
somewhere and l'm gonna find him.
Do you think you be fit to travel?
Of course l'm fit....
SAM: Quit shoving. l can walk.
Come over here, Sam.
Hilary, get some coffee.
l don't want you to go out there
any more, do you understand?
You think Vindicator's dead, too?
Yes, but that doesn't matter now.
No, l'll do this.
There isn't anything worth
the risk you're taking, Sam.
-There isn't?
-No.
This is longhorn country.
Let's face it and be done with it
once and for all.
Well, l'm not done with it.
You planted an idea in me,
Mrs. Evans, and the roots went deep.
And come summer, there's gonna be
crossbreed Herefords on this range.
Not on this range.
Just because you shaved
and took a bath...
don't be so high and mighty
about everything.
You don't know Hereford stock.
Sam Burnett, l give you
my permission...
to clear the range
of any crossbreed cows you can find.
lt's not good for Mistress Evans...
to hear you constantly
dragging up the past.
Besides, l've asked her to wed me.
Seems to me
like you've broken faith...
with everything
that brought you here.
l've never been a person
to avoid facing facts, Mr. Burnett.
And you should know that.
l was wrong about this country.
And l admit it.
Well, then, your husband
was wrong about Herefords, too.
Yes. All right, yes!
But there are other things
to consider.
There's Hilary and Jamie.
And life must go on.
All right, Alex...
l'll take
the crossbreed Herefords l find...
and l'll build a place for them.
Sam, don't. Can't you see it's over?
SAM: Not for me.
Give him a hand.
He's hell-bent
for disaster out there.
There's no stopping him.
Jamie, here's Sam.
You're driving them in, huh?
Yeah, a lot of them aren't up to it.
Dad says he can't remember
a worse winter.
We haven't seen much of you, Sam.
How have you been?
l'm fine. Fine.
-Building a place.
-Yeah, Juan was telling me.
Juan, he comes out
every once in a while, lends a hand.
-l'd like to see it, Sam.
-Not till it's finished.
l'm working
on the calving pens now. Waiting.
l'll be moving along.
Whoa, boy.
lt's Vindicator, isn't it?
A lot of longhorns died, too.
We knew what to expect, Sam.
Now, l want you to tell Bowen.
You tell him that this doesn't mean
there won't be calves.
You tell him that.
You tell them both.
-Hello, Hilary.
-Hello, Sam.
-Juan directed me how to get here.
-lt's not hard to find.
Jamie knows it.
He's been out here lots of times.
Yes. Jamie and l aren't
on very good terms at the moment.
l see.
-Could l talk to you for a bit, Sam?
-Sure.
HlLARY: Thank you.
l have some medium-hot coffee
in there. Would you like some?
HlLARY: Yes, thanks.
Here, l'll let you
take the real chair.
HlLARY: Thanks.
l'm just finishing up the calf pens.
l built two corrals
up in the canyon.
Do you still think
there will be calves?
SAM: Yes, l do.
You see, it's only the end of June.
Vindicator could have lasted longer
than anybody expected.
You could see his calves
clear into October.
l see.
-What did you say this was, Sam?
-Coffee.
l'm sorry about you and Jamie.
You two have a fight?
That's what
l wanted to talk to you about.
You see, everything's become
so complicated.
lt's just that Jamie asked me
to marry him.
SAM: l think that's fine.
HlLARY: And l said no.
-You don't love him?
-Yes, l do. Very much.
-Well, then--
-But don't you see...
if l marry Jamie then Mother
will have to marry Mr. Bowen.
No, l'm afraid l don't follow you.
Sam, don't you ever think
about Mother?
Think about her?
l think about her all the time.
l have this place here
and this idea...
and that's more than l ever had
in my whole life before.
And your mother
made this all possible for me.
And it means a lot.
Then, it's not right for you to
keep all these things to yourself.
lt's not fair. Mother needs you.
l'm afraid l'm not very good
at figuring out problems...
especially other people's.
All l know is that
l'm tied to this idea here...
that your mother gave me, and l'm
just bound to go through with it.
But it'll be too late, Sam.
Mother and Mr. Bowen--
No, your mother'll make
her own decision.
And that's as it should be.
But you ought to make yours, too,
Hilary.
lf you love Jamie, l think
you ought to go up and tell him.
And marry him.
-Do you think l should?
-l sure do.
Well, thanks for the coffee.
-l'm glad l came to see you.
-l'm glad you did, too.
Come back, Sam.
lt's a grand day.
Get out of there, you beast, you.
lt's a grand day, Mistress Evans.
-We've got plans to make.
-How thoughtful of you.
-What l mean to say is that--
-They're lovely.
l mean to say it's urgent
that we make haste.
We ought to be thinking
about setting a time.
Very well, Alex. September, then.
Late in September.
You're not still hoping that
there'll be some crossbreed calves?
l suppose so.
l can't seem to help myself.
lt's because that lunatic
is still out there searching.
He's bound to fail, l tell you.
You see that, don't you?
Yes, l know. But until September.
-That's not too much to ask, is it?
-No.
He'll certainly give up by then.
l agree. September it is.
l'm gonna borrow him
for a little while.
Don't you worry.
Jamie, there's Sam.
You got a whiteface.
This is what
you came here for, Martha.
There's Hereford crossbreeds
on this range.
That calf will make a fine
wedding present, Sam.
l told you l'd be back
when l found a crossbreed.
There's the first one.
You take your hand off
that woman, Sam Burnett.
And there'll be more whiteface
but l'm gonna need you, Martha.
Did you hear what l said?
l said take your hand off her.
-Alex, l....
-l can see for myself, woman.
That's Hereford country
and you can raise the bloody things.
Raise them if you can, l say.
That's just what we're going to do.
And before we're finished...
you're gonna see crossbreed
Hereford all over this range.
You can take that one with you.
That one looks like
one of the first dozen, Martha.
l'm glad we kept some longhorns,
Sam, for old times' sake.
So am l.
They're getting pretty scarce.
There. Watch that one now.
Do you still think one of them
will come to you?
No, not really.
Sometimes a bit of him
catches my eye.
l like to think
he's still out there. Somewhere.
