Papa!
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels...
I'll find you, Ezra...
Water...
***
You'll do exactly as I say,
you hear me?
I'm giving you a chance to cross
the California border from the west.
You murdered my chief of police.
- He did it.
- You realize you'll hang...
***
That baby is my brother's.
I love him.
Where the baby at?
I gave her to Declan Toole
to take and raise in New York.
You did what?
I thought it best.
- Aw, nah. I gotta go.
- No, Elam, they're gone.
They left on the train.
Can't believe you done this.
Toole will raise her up
in a good place.
It wasn't his baby.
She was mine.
- She was--
- She was mine.
Baby was white.
It weren't your baby.
Don't ever say that.
She was  baby.
Why'd you do it?
- Get away from me now.
-
I wanted to give you a chance
to understand
and still love me...
What?
But I reckon you don't.
I can't after what you done.
Huh?
Get outta here.
Get out!
Go back to whoring.
Get out!
Just remember that I gave you
a choice.
You ain't gave me nothing.
You just took.
You took everything I had away.
But I'm still here.
I'm still here, Elam.
You still a whore.
Now get outta my house.
Get outta here.
Get out!
Go back to your whoring.
Take your--
take it!
Shave and a morning whiskey,
Mr. Durant?
A double, I think, Willie.
Something doubly big
on your mind?
An old friend passed away.
I'm feeling
a little melancholy.
Good friends
is hard to come by.
All mine are deader than shit.
Gutshot, poison,
pox, bad wives, you name it.
Hmm.
How did yours die?
Greed, I think.
His reach exceeded his grasp.
Hold still, now.
Hmm?
Don't wanna nick you.
What are you doing here?
Mormons is building a spur
line railroad of their own.
You want it to come here
or Laramie?
Here, of course.
Ouch.
Sorry.
My pappy taught me
how to shave.
- I'm a little rusty.
-
The Mormons been poaching
my men.
There's bad blood
between me and them.
Please be careful.
- Damn it.
- You got to hold still.
Now, go like this.
- This?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you hired them to do
a survey for you back in '61.
Thought maybe you could broker
a deal to suit us both.
No.
- No.
- Can't or won't?
I won't sully my relations
with the Mormons
with your foundering.
For a man with a straight
razor to his throat,
I don't imagine
you're gulling me.
Cut my throat
or leave me be, Bohannon.
You're missing one hell
of an opportunity, Durant.
As did you, sir, just now.
Pretty?
Everywhere I looked,
she was pretty, hmm?
You seen Mr. Ferguson?
Yes, sir, but he ain't taking
no visitors right now.
Appreciate you trying
to protect him
but I need him
to ride out with me.
Ain't him I'm trying
to protect.
It's you.
He up there with a bottle
and a gun.
Ain't drawn a sober breath
since Eva gave away the baby.
He a little dangerous
right now.
A man who's lost everything's
got nothing to lose.
- Can he ride?
- Ride a horse?
'Bout only thing
he can do right now
is roll off that roof
and break his damn fool neck.
Might sober his ass up.
Elam.
Elam Ferguson.
What you want?
You plan on coming down
off there anytime soon?
I ain't decided yet.
You make a decision, son,
or I'll make it for you.
Son of a bitch.
That's a threat?
It's a warning.
Get his ass straight
or you get him outta here.
- I need every man working.
- I ain't his pappy.
And I ain't got time
for his shit.
I aim to be spiking rail
right through Cheyenne
in ten days
or God himself tell me why not.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon.
Good.
I'm looking
for a Thomas Durant.
What's your business, stranger?
Commonwealth Detective Malone,
Boston, Massachusetts.
Executive office.
Is that good enough for you?
Sure is. He's probably
getting his morning shave.
Is this where Senator Metcalf
was staying?
Only place in town.
I figured it was.
- You know where he went?
- No, sir.
Just disappeared into thin air.
- Got any rooms?
- Oh, I can give you his.
I have no idea
what happened to Metcalf.
And that's the truth.
We burned him
with the cholera victims.
I don't know that.
Well, I'm telling you.
Don't.
I can't tell the truth
if I don't know it.
Mr. Durant.
- Why don't you stay?
- All right.
Special Agent Malone.
Nice, uh, suite you got here.
Why did Senator Metcalf
stay behind
when General Grant, Oaks Ames,
and the board left?
- He didn't stay here.
- Desk clerk said he did.
Well, perhaps for a day or two.
Did he say where he was going?
Oh, he would have no reason
to tell me his travel plans.
His wife says
you are childhood friends.
Perhaps yes.
But we had...
we had very
different childhoods.
Whiskey tumbler.
It fell against the wall.
When was the last time
you saw the senator?
With, uh, some
of the hotel guests.
I'm sure he can't remember.
Can't say I do remember.
Good day, gentlemen.
And that's how it's done.
Where are you going?
I'm getting
the hell out of here.
Let's not appear to be fearful.
I'll only be gone a few days.
He gonna be any trouble?
Well, he won't bathe.
And while you were in Cheyenne,
he pulled that knife when
I asked him to sweep the church.
Boy, don't you know better
than to pull a knife
on a church lady?
You're not going to hurt him,
are you?
He ain't mine to whup.
Get your gear, boy.
You're coming with me.
He might've fallen off
a Mormon wagon.
Maybe somebody at the fort
will want him.
Will he be safe
traveling that far?
Safe as me, I reckon.
You get frisky
with that knife again,
I'm gonna leave you
to the Indians.
He doesn't think
you really will.
He don't know me so well.
Come on.
I have reconsidered
your request
to negotiate with the Mormons
on your behalf.
Somebody smoked your tree.
You out on a limb?
Colorful, Mr. Bohannon,
but no.
I assure you
I am acting without duress.
Might be trouble up ahead
where it is I'm going.
Don't need it following me too.
Now, there's one you wanna keep
your knife handy for.
You got me?
All right.
Let's ride.
Come on.
Right there.
See the way the hawk dropped
something on the rise?
Probably snatched up his lunch
afore he realized
it was a rattlesnake.
Why you keep looking back, doc?
We're in Mormon country now.
Thought you said
you was friendly with Mormons.
I've had my dealings
with them, yes.
That don't comfort me none.
Who is that boy?
Just a mute boy.
Probably fell off
one of the Mormon wagon trains.
Happens sometimes.
So you've adopted him
as your pet, hmm?
Thought I'd trade in
my walking bosses for him.
Oh, and what are you planning
to offer the Mormons
in exchange for your men?
Open passage west on the U.P.
for their settlers.
Free rail tickets.
Hmm, you  desperate.
Why the hell else
would I bring you?
You the sheriff here?
Chief of railroad police.
What?
Oh, nothing.
Just didn't figure on
the chief of police to be so--
Black.
Drunk.
Ain't a crime out here.
Detective Malone.
Boston Police.
Got a minute?
Just a few questions.
- We got trouble, Mickey.
- Not me.
Copper's asking questions
about Metcalf,
- and Durant made me look--
- What?
He made me look guilty.
- I warned you about Durant.
- I know.
And you were right.
This copper
is from Boston, Sean.
Mickey, what are we gonna do?
You're gonna get as far away
from me as you can
'cause all you ever do
is bring trouble.
So go, be gone.
I don't know you.
Why don't you do us all
a favor, Sean?
Disappear.
Just poof, thin air.
Don't even leave a stink.
All right.
Fade into these cottonwoods.
You hear any gunfire,
you hightail it back
to the railroad, you hear me?
Gentlemen!
Collis Huntington.
If you're here
after your deserted workers,
you're too late.
They and the Mormons
are already in my employ.
Thems is my men.
May I suggest we camp
in yonder meadow
out of rifle shot
of that gloomy place?
Mr. Scoggins.
We'll camp for dinner.
I ain't got time
to be lollygagging around here.
This is a fortuitous turn
for both of us.
Who would you rather deal
with, Huntington or the Mormons?
Just behave yourself at dinner,
and let me do the talking.
Mr. Bohannon,
my spies tell me
that your railroad
is faltering.
We had some setbacks--
weather and Indians
and rustlers.
Cholera hit us hard.
Some of my men went over there
just for food and water.
This is Mormon territory,
gentlemen.
They are fastidious
about interlopers,
especially negroes
and the oriental.
My deal with Brigham Young
forbids Chinese labor.
I'm gonna need men
to build through here.
It's a long walk back
for your Chinamen.
Their country
has been decimated.
Human meat hangs in the markets
at Nanjing.
My workers
will settle in California.
By the turn of the century,
I predict Mandarin
will be the state's
second language.
Thank you, Mr. Scoggins.
I, um--
I hired some Mormons
for some of my early surveys,
summer of '61.
Yeah, and it cost me
$1/4 million last week
to regain Brigham Young's
confidence in railroad men.
I had to pay that and some
to get reliable maps
of this region
to replace the worthless charts
they'd supplied me.
Horseshit.
You chose to cheat 'em.
Regardless, you're through
in the west, Thomas.
You know, I replace him
when he fails
to make his deadline.
Is that so?
I'll tell you what.
I'll make it simple for you.
You give me the men
you made arrangements for today,
and I'll give you Bohannon.
I ain't yours to give.
I know that's what you want.
It's certainly what I want.
And do either of us really give
a damn what he wants?
Is that how you negotiate?
I knew this was a waste of time.
Thank you for the supper.
Mr. Bohannon, you're not
gonna get your men back,
but I can offer you
something better.
This is what I can save you.
Eva, I can't hire you.
I can sleep
under the whiskey wagon.
That's no problem, okay?
I can eat scrappings.
I'm worth something, Mickey.
Look at what I'm worth.
Eva, I know
you're worth something.
But I can't afford trouble
with your Mr. Ferguson.
This ain't got nothing
to do with him.
It's got everything
to do with him.
He's out there right now.
He's angry, he's drunk.
And I'm speaking with the woman
who made him that way,
who broke his heart.
I'm sorry.
Eva, I can't.
Take this money.
Hop the next train.
You're already packed.
Please.
For both our sakes,
don't look back.
Mr. Ferguson.
Buy you a drink.
The train that's coming
ain't leaving till tomorrow.
Thank you.
Right.
You look like a man
with a problem
that leaving town's gonna fix.
You're waiting
on tomorrow's train?
Nowheres to go.
Nothing when I get there.
You?
Nowhere and nothing at all.
Hello.
I need you to send a wire
to the Boston police department.
Suspect by the name
of Sean McGinnes.
S-E-A-N
M-C-G-I-N-N-E-S.
And have 'em get back to me
as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Eva.
I was worried about you
and the baby
when I got word of the cholera.
Oh, God.
Eva, I'm so sorry.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
It's for the boy.
- Chinese candy.
- He's already asleep.
Thought you only
spoke Chinaman.
I am Chinese,
born and raised in Peking.
Hmm.
You hung a Mormon boy, I heard.
Pretty sure his father
killed my chief of police
and blamed his son.
That's not
how they're telling it.
Bet not.
Thank you,
Mr. Scoggins.
Brandy.
These Mormons
fought our government
across Missouri and Illinois
into Utah.
Massacres have been attributed
to their militias.
Brigham Young has vowed
to avenge
the blood of his prophets
on anyone who crosses them.
That would include you
if they were to catch you
over there, son.
I need them men.
I'm curious
what you're gonna offer 'em.
Smoking my pipe
to figure that out.
What is it you want
out of all this?
I ain't put
too much thought into it.
Let me tell you.
A big house on the beach,
a beautiful wife,
a little boy playing
with a bucket in the sand.
You tell me I'm wrong.
I guess maybe Durant's right.
Some men are architects,
and others, just builders.
I don't mind it like that.
The offer still stands
to build east with me.
Appreciate it.
I'm heading west
with the U.P.
Good night then.
I'll see your Pacific one day,
Mr. Huntington.
Yes, you will,
Mr. Bohannon,
one way or the other.
Did you really hang a boy?
I knew you could talk
all along.
Did you?
No.
What's your name?
- Ezra.
- Ezra.
Ezra.
What happened to you?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's get some rest.
Tomorrow, you're gonna
help me outsmart
two of the smartest men
in the world.
They don't know
what they don't know
about men like you and me.
And that's a lot.
Mm.
Yeah, I hear ya.
- Psalms, wake up.
-
Oh, brother, turn your head.
Something died in your mouth.
Get up.
Now get up.
- Get your pants on.
- What's the matter?
- We gotta go.
- Something burning?
We gotta go to New York,
get on the first train out.
Get away from here.
We going to New York.
Get your pants on.
We ain't going
to no damn New York.
- We got to.
- What?
My baby girl there.
We gotta find her.
You ain't getting
that baby back.
- We can find her.
- What? We can't find her.
- I need you.
- Look, your baby gone.
You hear me?
You listen.
She gone.
And you ain't getting her back.
Hmm?
Now you think on--
you think on this now.
Done been through too much.
Done come too far.
And deep down,
she wasn't yours.
You know it.
Hmm?
Find you a bunk.
You sleep this off.
Wake up the man
I know you to be.
I miss my baby girl.
I miss my baby girl.
Brother,
she gone.
- How you doing, Dutch?
- Awful, Mr. Bohannon.
They been working us
near to death,
feeding us hardtack and water,
praying and church ***
to go inside
out of the weather.
Glad you run off
from my railroad now?
Well, reckon it's better
than cholera.
But hell,
they promised us women.
Ain't none.
No whiskey, not even no coffee.
What kind of folks is that?
I can't be seen talking to you,
but I need you back, all right?
Rumor is they'll shoot us
if we try to run away.
I ain't seen it yet,
but just look yonder.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's about to get
a whole lot worse.
All kinds of shit's
about to get heaped on you, son.
You there!
What's your business?
Oh, I found this mute boy
out on the prairie.
Trying to get rid of him.
He one of yours?
- Has he papers?
- No.
Mostly he's got fleas
and rickets.
What's your name, stranger?
This ain't about me.
It's about the boy.
Yeah, well, there's something
about you I don't like.
Hell, there's something
about me
a lot of people don't like.
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!
Wait, hold, hold.
Damn it, boy.
Didn't I tell you not to pull
that knife on church folk?
Sorry about that.
Just be on our way.
Good day to you.
Come on, Dutch.
Be brave.
They can't shoot all of you
at once.
If they don't shoot me
in the back,
they're waiting for you
in the tree line.
I can't live like this anymore.
Malone sent a telegram
to Boston about me.
I've been running
my whole life, Mickey.
I don't wanna do it anymore.
What are you saying, Sean?
I'm gonna do what's right.
I'm gonna confess myself
to Ruth in the church
and then turn myself in
to police for all I've done.
You turn yourself in
for what you done,
and you're turning me in
for what we done.
I don't care.
You've denied me too.
You're as dead to me
as I am to you.
You'll hang, Sean.
I don't care anymore.
At least this way,
I'll be free.
Sean.
Hello, Ruth.
I've come to give confession.
You're a baptized
congregationalist now.
You should pray to God, not me.
Do you believe
a person can change, Ruth?
Make amends for the things
they've done?
I don't think
I've ever told you
about my mother.
I, uh--
I remember the day
she put us aboard the boat
in Cork,
my brother and me,
how she made me promise
to take care of him.
Why are you telling me this?
Why now?
I need--
I need you to hear this, Ruth.
I can't help you, Sean.
You're the only one who can.
No.
Ruth, listen to me.
- No, please, Sean.
- This is important.
Ruth, right--
right before we came out west...
- Please get out.
- It was--it was me...
- Please, Sean. Please, I--
- And these--these two girls.
And my brother Mickey,
who everyone loves.
- Please stop.
- Let me tell you
- who he really is.
- Sean, please stop!
Sean!
Sean!
Sean.
What have you done?
I just saved your life.
He came into my saloon
and confessed to me
that he killed
that Metcalf fellow.
I told him he should make
his confession to God
and turn himself in
to the police.
That's a strong sense
of conscience you have, sir.
He left the saloon in a state.
I had a bad feeling
seeing him come this way.
And wh I got here,
he had his hands all over her.
He assaulted you, did he?
Try to choke you
or strangle you?
May I?
It's just like the others.
The others?
This is good enough for me.
Imagine my luck.
The man who killed Metcalf
also suspected for two murders
in Boston.
I'll probably get a promotion,
maybe a raise.
Hmm.
Good piece of work
for you then.
There was an accomplice
with the bodies
in Boston harbor.
Killed a policeman.
Boston sounds like
a dangerous place
I'd not want to visit.
Good on you then.
Well, thank you
for the ride, Collis.
Not at all.
I'm heading east to inspect
the Union Pacific's bridges,
see which ones I'll have
to replace when I take over.
Well, that's--
that's still
in Mr. Bohannon's hands for now.
Bravo, Mr. Bohannon!
I understand
your brother confessed
to the murder of Metcalf,
and then you were compelled
to shoot him in the church.
Yes.
And the Boston policeman
has left.
- He has.
- Hmm.
What is it
that you want, McGinnes?
You do understand
what this means.
It means that,
had I gone to jail
for any reason,
your prospects in Cheyenne
would have dimmed considerably.
Do you understand?
I am but a simple Irishman
seeking his fortune
in the new world,
Mr. Durant.
When and if I choose
my hand to fall on you,
it will reach through the veil
of your incomprehension
and smite you
not in some dark alley
or a cowardly corner,
but in full daylight.
Ah.
Well, with a little bit
o' luck,
you had the advantage on me.
But I have been pushed aside,
falsely accused,
robbed, wounded,
and insulted enough.
Now, you will wean yourself
from these delusions,
and you may still have
a future here.
Otherwise, not.
Good day, sir.
What happened
in Boston, Mickey?
Sean.
Two young girls,
a few months apart.
A shopkeeper's daughter...
and a schoolteacher.
Much like Ruth.
Sean was Sean.
They came to bad ends,
they did.
Sean did what he did.
What about you?
Sean was my brother.
