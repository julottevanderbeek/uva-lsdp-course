If your world has
only done you wrong
and all you find
yourself is all alone
and if there's no one
there to see you through
Parker!
What's up, babe?
Not you. Your sister.
In the house now!
What for?
You need to pick a dress.
I... just pick one for me.
I trust you.
... and Delilah once again
I like that dress, Aunt Molly.
-  The first one's better.
- Try this one on.
Has Jake signed the divorce papers?
It's been six months.
I'm not gonna talk about
my ex-husband right now.
He's not your ex-husband yet.
Change my mind needlessly
Repeat after me.
"I, Heather Endelsohn... "
I, Heather Endelsohn...
"Take thee, Jason Bluford... "
Take thee, Jason Bluford...
"To be my lawfully wedded husband."
Jason and Heather have made
their solemn vows to each other.
By the authority vested in me
by the great state of Texas,
it is my pleasure to proclaim
Jason and Heather husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Come unto me

- Uhh!

Get her! Get her!
Go! Get her before she goes!
Somebody get her!

Our hearts are broken today.
- Evil has touched the community.
-
Reports suggest the Bexar County
Assistant District Attorney
- was shot...
-  ... Was shot and possibly killed.
That's now taking place
at this church behind me.
-
-
The victim, we do believe,
was a Bexar County
Assistant District Attorney.
There's our money shot.
The driver said she paid him 100 bucks
to drop her outside Chuy's in Arbor Vista.
Well, she won't get far,
not with that face and ass.
Lieutenant.
Ha ha!
Cinco-Peso Parker is here.
It's been quite a year
for you, sweetheart...
from State Trooper to Texas Ranger.
Well, congrats.
Could be a spot open next year.
Maybe two if I get shot or fired.
Well, from what I hear,
I'm one chromosome out of contention.
Our J.O.I.C. Lieutenant
notified border patrol,
and we've tapped into
the surveillance cameras
- on the interstate.
- We've got a statewide A.P.B. out,
and a picture of the
shooter is being circulated.
- We'll get her.
- What evidence so far?
A pair of high heels and the gun.
Our lab can run D.N.A. on the shoes.
but I sure do appreciate the backup.
What about interviews?
We're shuttling witnesses
back to headquarters...
all 237 of 'em.
I'd like to speak with the groom.
Shoulder to cry on type of thing?
I don't want to step on toes.
And yet, you just did.
Mr. Bluford?
I'm Ranger Parker.
I brought you a water.
I'm sorry about the loss of your wife.
I'm working in conjunction
with the S.A.P.D.
The D.A. called you?
Yes, sir.
I'm brought in on complex cases
as support to local law enforcement.
The D.A. wants to throw every
asset available into this.
Do you recognize this woman?
She's...
she's... she shot...
Let me be more clear.
Have you seen her before today?
No. I don't... I don't think so.
You don't think so?
I don't know her.
You own nine gyms in San Antonio, correct?
Yes.
She works at the original
downtown location.
I've never met her.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Do you believe him?
According to his micromannerisms
and eye movement, yes.
And what does your gut tell you?
He loved her. He was
devastated and confused.
He's telling the truth.
You know, the rangers might be considered
the world's best interrogators,
but Jason Bluford just pulled the wool over
those big baby blues of yours.
- And you're sure of that?
- 100%.
We retrieved the groom's cell.
Martina Alvarez called
him nine times this morning
before the wedding.
We got a jealous lady on the loose.
Ranger Parker.
Hey. We're gonna need a search warrant.
Tell S.W.A.T. to assemble.
Alamo Budget, room 11.
Maid recognized her from the TV.
927 San Antone.
Have S.W.A.T. Sergeant go to TAC.
10-4.
Switching. I'm on air now.
We are staged and ready to move in.
Take the door.
I bet these are your size.
We have the getaway driver's testimony
that you contacted him in
advance of the shooting.
You know what that means?
You killed an A.D.A.
You killed an innocent woman
who devoted her life to justice.
You have any remorse?
How long have you been
sleeping with Jason Bluford?
Jason told me he was leaving her.
He wasn't going to go
through with the wedding
because he loves me.
But then he changed his mind.
We were supposed to meet.
We were going to go away together,
leave Texas this morning.
When you were together,
where would you meet?
At the gym.
In the steam room.
His office sometimes.
So you were supposed to
meet at the gym this morning,
but Jason never showed up.
And that bastard never even
bothered to answer your calls.
That
must've felt real bad, huh?
You gave him eight months of your life.
He promised you everything,
and then he left you cold.
So you...
shot his wife.
If you couldn't have him, no one could.
Is that right?
Yes.
Ms. Alvarez,
can you remember if Jason
was right or left-handed?
Right.
Any idea of a motive?
S.A.P.D. has arrested Martina
Alvarez in the shooting of
Assistant District
Attorney Heather Endelsohn.
Cause of death is a gunshot
to the middle of the chest.
So this is wrapped up?
Salazar sure thinks so.
There's nothing that man
likes more than a podium.
He is one hell of an investigator.
Alvarez wasn't sleeping with the groom.
She's lying.
Well, then she just lied her
way into the death penalty.
Her nails were chipped.
Is that supposed to break my heart?
You don't shoot the wife of your soul mate
without looking like the
one he should've picked.
Salazar has a confession,
and you have chipped nails.
Jason Bluford was left-handed.
Shooter guessed right-handed.
Do I need to tell you
why a woman would know
which hand her lover favors?
I saw fear in her eyes, lieutenant.
There's more to this case.
Don't burn bridges with S.A.P.D., Molly.
They're fully capable of conduct...
I didn't say they weren't capable.
Yes, the groom knew the
shooter. Yes, that is correct.
I just said they're wrong.
The only difference is
Everything around
here feels the same
procrastination,
always waiting like a...
Move it.
No. Don't go.
Oh, come on. Get up.
I need to go to work.
Neil, get off the damn bed.
Neil!
Oh, look at these.
Aunt Molly, did Jake have
another girlfriend besides you?
Come again?
Mom says that's why you
moved back here last June.
You're 9. That's none of your business.
But I don't want you to leave.
It's so much more fun with you here.
You're my best friend.
Hey.
What goes on between adults
is not the stuff kids need to worry about.
Why I left, where I live...
none of that changes
the way I feel about you.
Got it?
-  Get rid of that now.
-  Why? Daddy!
No, no, no, no.
No, daddy's not getting
in the middle of this.
Aunt Molly,
can you please tell her she's going crazy?
Y'all, this is not my fight.
Those girls of yours are way too grown up.
I did not wear lip gloss at 14.
Hell, you don't wear it now.
And a 9-year-old
should not be worried
about my divorce.
Well, what about your brother?
Am I allowed to be worried?
My personal life is not something
And no, you don't need to be worried.
You were gonna drive your
daughter to school like that?
- No...
- With paint all over her face?
-  I'm... I'm sure...
- Good luck with the crazies, big boy.
body isn't mind
but I got a heart of gold
and I'm sitting in a
desk nailed to the floor
doing everything I'm told
doing everything I'm told
You dragged me to the doctor
and you didn't tell me why
a 9-year-old in headphones
raising hands, raising
hell, raise 'em high
Oh, you better raise 'em high
ooh, hoo
you don't even know,
you don't even know
I have a visual 10 miles
outside of Bandera...
Headed west.
You don't even know, ooh, hoo
Hey, I'm on a drop. Let me call you back.
Why was the D.E.A. meeting with
the A.D.A. who was just killed?
Got 10 kilos of dope about
to fall out of the sky.
I gotta go.
No, no, no, no. Don't... ugh! Dan.
Oh, what a coincidence.
I doubt it.
Hey, wait. Politicians talk to
prosecutors from time to time.
I don't want to talk to you, Jake.
I know. I know. I know.
That's not what I'm here.
Hey. Hey. Senator.
Hi. Jake. How are you?
Great. It's good to see you.
Uh... listen.
I moved out of our loft.
Everything's gone.
Here. Here, you can move back in.
All by yourself.
I... I know you need some time.
Time? Is that what you think I need?
What I need is for you to
sign our divorce papers.
We're gonna get through this.
I'm already past it.
I'm never gonna divorce you.
Never.
I love you.
Molly, I do.
I just hope you find the
self-confidence to believe that.
Winston was scheduled to
meet with Heather Endelsohn
two days before she was shot.
Sorry, that's not coincidence.
My instincts are right on this.
What did Agent Winston tell you
was the reason for the meeting?
Idiot hung up on me.
But he knows I'll find him.
How many active cases do you have, Molly?
But?
I'm going back for Alvarez.
Rangers support other agencies
when they lack resources.
That's not the case with S.A.P.D.
Are you telling me to drop this?
No. I agree with you.
- It's odd D.E.A. was dealing with a state prosecutor.
- Mm-hmm.
Find out why.
But keep S.A.P.D. in the loop.
Yes, sir.
I forgot cream,
but I also brought you
some toothpaste and lotion.
And there's some... chapstick.
I have nothing else to say to you.
S.A.P.D. has charged you
with premeditated murder.
And they have plenty of
evidence to support their case.
My training and my instinct
tell me that you weren't having
an affair with Justin Bluford.
And I'm hoping that you
come to trust me enough
to tell me why you're lying,
and the why of it all
that might just keep you off death row.
I knew what I was doing
when I pulled the trigger.
If you were angry and wanted revenge,
why didn't you just shoot him?
Because he hurts more alive.
It's Jason.
You said "Justin" earlier
to see if I would notice.
It's Jason.
My mistake.
-  I love this museum.
-
My dad used to take me here.
He was one hell of a sheriff.
Yes, he was.
-
- I'm sure he'd be real proud you made Ranger.
I left
my heart down in Mexico
You have got to meet this guy.
Some señorita not so long ago
There he is.
Glad to see you made it.
Captain. Always a pleasure.
Mm-hmm. Who's this filly?
Molly Parker. Company "F."
This is retired company Captain Whitman.
Wally.
I keep forgetting they let
lady folk into the ranks.
- Just two.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, some of the
old-timers were against
adding women to the force.
But let me tell you something.
Women are a hell of a lot smarter than men.
They'll look you straight in
the eye when they're lyin',
even though the facts
are stacked against 'em.
Learned that one from my ex-wives.
-
- Uh...
Um, excuse me, gentlemen.
Of course.
Ain't nothing but a memory
What do you say we get a drink, Wally?
Mm-hmm.
-  It might've been, it's gone
- ____
-  I'd rather be here north of the border
- ____
the place where I belong
It won't work. What's that?
Seducing me for information.
I would never do that.
Just like you would never bed me for intel
on a D.E.A. investigation.
- Never.
-
We can't keep doing this.
Do all D.E.A. agents look like hell?
Yeah. Otherwise we get shot.
Mm.
Why were you meeting
with Heather Endelsohn?
Uh-huh. So that's what last
night was about after all?
Same as you.
No. No, I can separate my ambitions.
Mm.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think Martina
Alvarez shot an a.D.A.
- Because she was sleeping with the groom.
- No?
And the fact that you were
meeting with the D.A.'s office
tells me that your agency
has an interest in this.
So... tell me what it is.
It's not your jurisdiction.
It's a case that I've been
building for two years.
And I am not gonna cross
contaminate it with the Rangers.
Alvarez didn't shoot an
A.D.A. because she was jealous.
My bet? The cartel was involved.
So why don't you tell me how
so we can help each other?
Right. So that we can help each other.
Wait. What do I get out of this again?
Federal witness.
Really? 'Cause from where I stand,
the S.A.P.D. has charged a woman with
premeditated murder...
And that doesn't relate to the D.E.A.
You know it's related.
Well, then why don't you
get me something to prove it?
Shutting me out is a big mistake,
and I'll prove it.
- I think Alvarez is working for the cartel.
- No.
They hire hit men, not little girls.
Yeah, maybe not this time.
Maybe they chose Alvarez
specifically because of
her proximity to the groom.
And then they could sell
this as a crime of passion.
- Well, then why does Alvarez go along with it?
- I don't know.
But whatever it is, it terrifies her.
More than the death penalty?
I don't know why she's so afraid,
but she served her purpose.
S.A.P.D. missed something.
I'm gonna go back to Alvarez's house.
If you're wrong in this...
Yeah, I know. I'm a lone ranger.
What's your name?
This is your daughter.
I know that because the prison intake exam
shows you have a cesarean scar.
This is your mother.
Her name is Gabriella.
And you sent her $250 every month
from the Western Union
across the street from the
gym where you worked downtown.
This month,
she never picked it up.
Now I can't prove it,
but I suspect that they were kidnapped
by the Nuevo Laredo cartel.
Martina, you're not a murderer.
You're just a young woman who's
trying to protect her family.
You think you can dig
deep and find the truth?
You don't know anything.
I was nearly killed because of you.
I spoke to your attorney.
I can have you transferred
to a federal prison,
where you will be under protective care.
I don't care what happens to me.
- Martina, I understand how it feels to be trapped...
- No, you don't understand.
That's not true.
I know you're terrified.
I saw it right away in your eyes.
And I know how it feels
to be so desperately afraid
that you make horrible mistakes.
Ten years ago,
I married a man
that I thought loved me,
deeply.
I was young.
He was...
he was strong,
and I felt protected,
until one day...
he hit me.
And then he hit me again
and again.
I've never told anyone the truth,
and maybe I never will,
because I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed that I didn't have the strength
to leave sooner.
But I couldn't.
I felt trapped.
But, Martina, I was wrong.
Now I'm not here as your friend.
I'm here because you face the death penalty
for a crime you were coerced into doing.
Tell me what happened right
now, and I will find your family.
How do you
know they're still alive?
I don't.
But if they are,
I will find them and
get them out of Mexico.
But you have to tell me
everything that you know now.
And told me they had
kidnapped my little girl...
-
- and my mother.
And the men said they would
kill them if I didn't cooperate.
They gave me a gun and
told me to go to that church
If I did, my mother
and daughter would live.
They took my phone
and they called the man.
They made me kill that woman.
I had no choice.
Alvarez is willing to testify
against the Nuevo Laredo cartel.
You find that interesting?
I find it suspicious.
The cartel kidnapped her mother
and daughter.
They used it as leverage
to force Alvarez to kill the A.D.A...
something the cartel doesn't
do unless absolutely necessary.
What did the D.A.'s office have?
Nine months ago,
a woman was stabbed to death
in alamo heights by her husband.
He walked.
S.A.P.D. didn't have enough to charge him.
I was working with
Endelsohn to reopen the case.
Why?
So I could use the murder rap to flip him,
get him to testify.
He's a big asset to
the Nuevo Laredo cartel.
In what context? Smuggler?
No. No, no, no. He's...
Order ready!
-  Pick it up.
- He works for a trucking company.
And they use him to
authenticate the paperwork
to transport about $40
million in contraband a year.
All right, he was worth
protecting, and so they did.
They killed a District Attorney.
The cartel will do anything.
Alvarez won't cooperate
unless she sees her
mother and daughter again.
- No.
-
No. There is no way that
I'm risking my informants
on a raid into Mexico
for two people who are
probably already dead.
Well, then you don't have a case.
You're insane.
If you help me get these people out,
you have a real shot at
taking down a major ring.
It could be a huge win for you.
Yeah? What do you get?
Justice.
Justice doesn't
motivate me in to Mexico.
- Dan...
- Molly,
I will not risk agency
assets on soft intel.
Period.
There's a good chance
Alvarez's mother and
daughter will be killed
because I couldn't let the
case close with S.A.P.D.
I can't forgive myself.
Dan, I'm asking for your help.
We do this, we do it alone.
I'll use one contact.
I understand.
There's an excellent chance
we're gonna die in Mexico.
We're wasting time.
Pull on up.
My contacts found them.
They're being held outside a rodeo arena
the cartel uses to move drugs.
I need to see your I.D.
-
-  All right, there's two.
The plan's to tip the
cartel about a false raid,
force them to move out so we can move in.
Cartel thinks the federales
are planning a raid.
It's a false set up,
so they move out of the area
where you need to go into.
They'll move the drugs.
You wait for snipers on rooftops
here, here, and here
to head away from the area
Once you see them making a move,
you have about 20 minutes
before they find out the raid was false.
When they get back,
we better be far away.
How long before the raid's tipped?
Three hours.
You really play the trumpet?
Every Tuesday night at
the Continental Club.
Go. Go.
Cartel's back.
Come here. Come on. Come on.
Uhh!
Aah!
- Hang on! Hang on!
- Aah!
tienes vibración

I mean, we can talk about this fence thing
till the cows come home,
but the truth is, the damn thing
doesn't keep the border secure.
It always gets back to funding.
Of course it does.
Honey. What are you...
No. No, y'all don't need to get up.
What? Hi.
Sign the divorce papers.
Sign them, or I'll tell the
world who you really are.
Sorry for the interruption, gentlemen.
Have a good day.
My apologies, gentlemen.
The
assailant, Martina Alvarez,
As of yet, federal agents have
not made a formal statement
but initial reports
suggest a mexican cartel
used the trucking company
to ship contraband.
Thought you weren't coming in today.
I just forgot my trumpet.
Need you out on the road
first thing in the morning.
Fredericksburg. A bank was hit.
$1.5 million.
I'll leave before dawn.
Molly.
I keep our relationship
on a need-to-know basis.
But if I ever find out
you crossed the border
to free Alvarez's family,
I'll fire you.
I understand.
Huh!
Wait! Wait! Jimmy...
I forgot. No salt.  Please.
And she likes fresh lime juice.
I want to dance in the moonlight
Wow.
This is unexpected.
I'm full of surprises.
Yes. Yes, you are.
I offer you
and while the whole
world is sleeping
we can start anew
I want to dance in the moonlight
Only with you
Yeah.
Maybe it was my mistake
maybe I'm the fool
that let you walk away
That's my cue.
Don't mess it up.
And loving words
I'm here to plead my case
I want to dance in the moonlight
only with you
take my heartlight and roses
that I offer you
and while the whole
world is sleeping
we can start anew
I want to to dance in the moonlight
only with you
