DR. LYNNTON: There he is.
There's the stallion. That's War Winds.
Beautiful.
That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.
Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.
Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.
DR. LYNNTON: We'll get to the horses
in the morning.
You're from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?
Texas, Mama.
MRS. LYNNTON: You from Texas,
Mr. Beckwith?
BICK: Yes, ma'am, Texas.
Benedict's the name.
MRS. LYNNTON: You're here
about the horses, aren't you?
BICK: Yes, ma'am.
I came to buy your stallion, War Winds,
if your daughter doesn't mind too much.
In all likelihood,
Leslie will be leaving us soon anyway.
David is with the embassy in Washington.
He's been called back to England.
Will she like it there, do you think?
She's going to marry him?
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict
War Winds.
I can tell you all his bad points.
For one, he eats too much,
doesn't he, Papa?
You see, it's either War Winds or me.
Something has to go.
You know that horse is just too spirited
for any woman to ride.
I know your horse is going to miss you
and all this nice, green country, but...
I'll try to make him happy in Texas.
Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?
No, ma'am, not altogether.
MRS. LYNNTON: You must tell us
about Texas, Mr. Benedict.
BICK: It's not that easy.
It's different than any other state, I think.
At least that's what we think.
It's almost a different country.
DAVID: From an Englishman's point
of view, its size takes your breath away.
Yes, it's big all right.
How large are your ranches?
Most every size. Large and small.
Mr. Benedict's Reata is
one of the largest of them all.
Oh, really?
And just how large is that?
It's one of the biggest.
How big is that?
There are one or two others as big,
I suppose, up where we come from...
and some larger ones on the coastal plains.
Can't you be more specific?
What's the size of your place?
Around a half million.
I'd call that quite a parcel!
How many acres did you say, Mr. Benedict?
He said 595,000 acres, Mama.
And you should see the greedy look
on your face.
BICK: No, thank you, Miss Leslie.
I'm afraid I wouldn't look good
in this outfit.
I like your country.
Why don't you stay a while
and really see something of it?
It's roundup time in my country.
Big spring roundup.
Your country?
Reata.
Your country, my country.
You make us sound so far apart.
Maybe you could come out and see it...
if you get a chance.
BICK: Leslie....
DAVID: Leslie, dear.
BICK: Miss Leslie....
DAVID: Leslie?
I'll be off real early in the morning, so...
goodbye.
I'm awfully glad you came.
I'm not going to say goodbye to you
in the moonlight.
It would just be too touching. Good night!
"Texas."
Are you in love with him?
Yes, I think so.
LACEY: Leslie?
LESLIE: Good night.
If you won't marry David Karfrey...
will you give him to me?
LESLIE: Yes! Now, good night.
BICK: As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.
DR. LYNNTON: $10,000 is a lot of money.
BICK: It's a lot of horse.
DR. LYNNTON: Let's have some breakfast
and get going.
BICK: Why, Leslie!
LESLIE: Good morning.
You don't look as if you'd been dancing
all night, Miss Leslie.
I came home at 10:45.
I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.
Let the poor boy eat his breakfast in peace.
It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.
We really stole Texas, didn't we?
You're catching me a bit early
to start joking.
But I'm not joking.
It's all right there in the history books.
The next thing you know,
they're claiming it from Mexico.
I never heard anything as ignorant
as some Eastern people--
Oh, please, Jordan.
You all think
that the glory happened in the East...
with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!
Do you know about San Jacinto?
Have you heard about the Alamo?
Why, certainly.
I read about them all last night.
I didn't mean to be impolite,
but it's so new to me.
and so fascinating!
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.
They feel very strongly about their state.
He shouldn't take it so hard.
Jordan, you would think
somebody had spoiled you terribly.
Your wife or somebody.
I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.
Why aren't you married?
First you attack a man's country,
and now you try to pry into his family life.
Thank you, Doctor.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Lacey.
-Good morning, Papa.
How are we doing?
We'll have to be getting along soon
if you're going to make your train.
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning, Nancy.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, Mr. Benedict.
Isn't this a beautiful morning?
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished
his breakfast...
why don't you show him the stables?
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.
It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.
And anyway, Mother...
he's probably engaged to marry
the daughter of the adjoining ranch...
who, though beautiful,
is comparatively poor.
She only has 200,000 acres
and half a million cows.
Is she pretty?
We must hurry.
Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady
that you're going to marry...
with all those cows?
DR. LYNNTON: I'll get the car.
It's funny, ma'am.
My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.
There was some talk of my marrying her,
but I'm not.
DR. LYNNTON: Come on,
if you want to catch that train.
It all sounds so romantic!
Come along, David, you're for me.
LESLIE: What's that, a wolf?.
No, honey.
It's just a little old coyote.
Don't you think you've done
enough sightseeing?
LESLIE: Tell me when we're in Texas.
BICK: That's Texas you've been looking at.
I don't know how other brides feel
on their honeymoon...
but I'm having a lovely time.
We can't say it's been dull.
That is, so far anyway.
BICK: Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.
LESLIE: Where?
Hello.
Good morning.
LESLIE: Is that Texas?
BICK: It's Benedict.
That's where we ship from.
BICK: These people never learn!
I'm Mrs. Benedict.
That means, "Welcome, the newlyweds."
BICK: Let's go, Leslie.
And what is your name?
Ángel Obregón.
That's a beautiful name.
Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.
This is it, honey. This is your home.
But it's huge!
BICK: My dad built it to show the cotton
crowd we were just as high-powered.
LESLIE: It's enormous
just for the two of us.
BICK: Luz lives here with me.
Take it easy, Leslie.
What are your names?
What do you mean behave?
Here we don't make a fuss
over those people. You're a Texan now.
LESLIE: Is that a state of mind?
I'm still myself.
You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.
LESLIE: I still have a mind of my own.
Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.
We're gracious, but....
LESLIE: Fine thing...
standing here quarreling
with rice still in our hair!
LESLIE: It's so nice and cool!
LUZ: I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.
We didn't know you were there.
Well, we're home. We're here.
I've been looking for you for weeks.
LESLIE: We weren't expected
to be back sooner, were we?
LUZ: With all the spring work to be done,
the roundup...
I didn't figure Bick would stay away.
BICK: If I miss a roundup every time I have
a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will l?
BICK: I thought I fired him off this place.
BICK: Where do you think you're going
with my automobile?
Just hold on.
Don't go taking off on me.
That old truck broke down again.
You want me going down the road?
That's exactly what I was going to do.
But she said,
"You stay on and do your work."
BICK: Next time I say to get, you get!
LUZ: Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling
about something.
JETT:  is the one who said to stay.
LUZ: That's right.
With you away,
we needed all the help there was.
They're all scared to death of her.
You know that.
Everyone, except you and me.
BICK: You just tend to your work.
Tell me who is the boss around here...
and I'll be glad to do anything you want.
Just tell me who's the boss.
This is Bick's new wife.
Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.
LESLIE: Hello.
LUZ: He works for us.
LUZ: You'd better get going, Jett,
and get that truck fixed.
Nobody is king
in this country.
Nobody, no matter what they think.
I'm sorry, honey. Things go  here
every time I'm away.
LUZ: Remember the time of the big rodeo?
slept on the sofa in your office.
Look....
We're married.
You know how that is.
and the breeze can get at us.
LUZ: Breakfast's ready.
You and Jordan
have had breakfast already?
We have our coffee and talk
every morning of our lives at 5:00.
Try and get things rounded up for the day.
I thought I was going riding with him
to the roundup.
LUZ: It would've been too hot for you.
I told him so.
Bring it in here.
Sit down.
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble
with a lot of Easterners.
Thank you.
I'm fine, Luz.
I'm a lot tougher perhaps
than you think I am.
Me...
I never had a sick day in my life.
Except when I got thrown and tromped on.
All you gotta do is take it easy.
This rich Texas air will fix you up.
Don't you worry none
about being lonesome.
I'll round up the neighbors.
You're going to meet some folks.
Yes, indeed.
You're going to meet some folks.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Bale Clinch.
Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.
I'd like you to meet my little wife, Adarene.
I'm mighty pleased to meet you.
This is Judge Whiteside.
How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?
We sure are proud to have you here.
Bick, congratulations.
Mighty happy for you, boy.
She sure is pretty.
I think so.
LUZ: Here's Ula Japes.
Glad to meet you, ma'am.
Good to see you, Bick.
This is Ms. Wharton.
Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.
LUZ: Fernie Kling.
We're glad to have you with us.
You've really done well for yourself.
Thank you, Fernie.
Now you'll meet the neighbor
I told you about.
The one who lives 50 miles away
with all those cows?
Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.
LESLIE: Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.
Jordan told me so much about you.
Mighty glad to know you.
I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.
My name is Mort Snythe.
They call me Pinky.
LUZ: Come here.
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-We'll be seeing you.
BALE: This will perk you up.
LESLIE: Thank you.
I propose a toast to a daughter
of old Maryland...
now blooming into a citizen
of the Lone Star State. To the bride!
Are you all right?
I'm fine, don't worry.
VASHTI: There's another bride here today.
BICK: How's that, Vashti?
Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday
in Hermosa.
WOMAN: I'm gonna kiss him!
I guess that leaves only me.
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows
you'd rather herd cattle than make love!
LUZ: One thing you gotta say for cattle:
You put your brand on one of them,
you know where it's at!
COOK: Come and get it!
The best food you ever ate, honey.
This is real Mexican
.
That's where we get the word "barbecue."
What is that?
Calf's head.
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth
and then wrap it tight in canvas...
and put it down in a pit
of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.
And do those brains taste sweet!
How fascinating!
I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.
It must be the heat.
You call this hot?
Eat it while it's hot!
BALE: What's the matter with her, Bick?
That's what I was afraid of!
Leslie?
LESLIE: Good morning, Luz.
What are you doing up?
LESLIE: Getting breakfast.
I think there's something
we should get in the clear.
I don't want to take your place.
I want you to know that.
But I can't have you taking my place either.
I can't be just a guest
in my husband's house.
BICK: There you are.
Good morning, darling.
BICK: How are you feeling?
LESLIE: Fine.
You look fine.
I want everybody to know, no matter
what happens around here in the future...
I am never going to faint again.
I'll never get the hang of you,
Mrs. Benedict.
A horse that cost you a lot
for breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.
I wouldn't let anyone ride him.
I wouldn't care if she's your wife.
She's going to fall off and break her neck.
That's Old Polo. He's head
He's been here longer than any of us.
Did you ever see such stock?
Are they all ours?
BICK: These and 49,000 others
just like them.
great herds of them, all the way to Kansas.
He was a pretty good old boy.
I mean, he was tough, too.
My old man brought in stock from Europe
and bred them in the best ways.
Look at them.
How are you doing?
Tired, honey?
Don't you worry about me.
I'm a tough Texan now.
You know, I love you, Tex.
LUZ: Howdy, everybody.
BICK: Hold on a minute. I want you
to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.
LESLIE: Honey, I'm fine, really.
BICK: There's no use overdoing it.
Go along with Jett.
Good morning, Jett.
BICK: Take it easy, Jett.
I don't want to chew on this, Bick...
but I think we'd better get it straight.
I run the house, don't l?
Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.
She doesn't even speak Spanish.
They understand English
when they want to.
I know how to handle Mexicans.
I've done it all my life.
They'd sit on their honkers all day
if I didn't keep after them.
All right, Luz. Cool off.
I thought we ought to talk
without her around.
I don't want to feel that you're setting up
against me, Bick.
Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.
That gal's my wife.
And you're fair enough, I think,
to try and get along with her.
All right.
I'll get a horse and help push
the stock along.
Maybe it'll make me feel better.
You gotta push something.
LUZ: When I get enough, I'll ride on in.
JETT: Why did you come to Texas?
I mean, everybody else's trying
to get away from here.
Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.
This is my husband's land.
This is his home.
Who gets hold of this much land
unless they took it off somebody else?
You're not exactly loyal
to your employer, Jett.
No, I'm not complaining.
They bought this land long ago.
The Benedicts.
-They got it though purchase, years ago.
-Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.
That's not true. They bought and traded
for Spanish land grants.
They paid for it all right.
They paid five cents an acre.
I know my folks were here long enough
to get rich, too.
Except they just weren't so foxy.
Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.
Nobody rides him but the
I've been riding what I want to for 30 years.
Already he bucked off López.
If he bucks me down,
he won't be the first one that's done it.
I suppose you came out here
to show me how to run things, too.
Let's go.
JETT: I'm not too awful bad now.
Of course,
they don't like me quite enough to...
kind of divvy up
what they got way too much of.
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?
But I like you.
I like you, too.
You're the best-looking gal
we've seen around here in a long time.
The prettiest one
I think I've seen down here.
LESLIE: Thank you, Jett.
That's a very nice compliment.
I'll tell my husband of that,
with your approval.
No, I wouldn't do that.
No, I wouldn't do that.
Beautiful Reata!
Them's your neighbors live there.
Them kids there. Them's your ranch people.
Those are Ángel Obregón's kids.
That's the man who met us at the train.
Sure in good shape, ain't they?
Whole bunch of them sick.
What's the matter with them?
JETT: I don't know. Just sick.
Every one of them.
Wait a minute. I want to get out here.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Wait.
You're the boss.
And you know it, don't you?
LESLIE: May I come in?
that I do not rise.
The baby is sick.
My milk is not good.
LESLIE: Have you seen a doctor?
Doctor? It is too far to come.
JETT: Mrs. Leslie,
I think we'd better be getting on.
This baby is extremely ill.
JETT: You're not supposed to be in there.
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregón.
I'll be back soon.
Bick's going to blow a gasket.
LESLIE: What is it?
BICK: Where in the world have you been?
I've been looking for you, too.
What happened to her?
I stopped by the village.
What happened?
It's just awful.
I don't know. She was riding War Winds.
She might have been thrown or something.
What does the doctor say?
It's bad.
She's been riding since she was six.
She could ride anything.
And now this happens.
How is she?
She's in a state of shock. Very serious.
Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.
I'm doing all I can do.
I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.
Doctor.
If only I hadn't bought that horse....
Don't blame yourself, Jordan.
If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.
Don't blame yourself.
-Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.
-How do you do?
DR. WALKER: I wish
I could've made it for Luz.
DR. BORNEHOLM: Dr. Walker did
everything he could, I assure you.
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,
I'm afraid.
Mrs. Obregón's baby is very sick.
His temperature must be at least 105.
Will you stop by, please?
Mrs. Obregón?
In the village.
Jett will take you.
I'll go with you myself, Doctor.
What is this?
You can't do that.
He can't go there.
He's our doctor.
-Our doctor?
-Yes.
You mean, the Benedicts' only?
No, I mean, all of us.
He doesn't tend those people.
They have a way of doing things
by themselves.
How did she get there?
Now, don't go climbing on me.
I don't feel too good about it.
Jordan, darling,
I don't think you quite understand.
There's a child who's very sick.
I must take Dr. Walker.
You'll go, won't you, Doctor?
I'll be back just as soon as I can.
BICK: I'm a lot better, honey.
LESLIE: That's a good boy.
BICK: I shot him.
BICK: The baby?
LESLIE: He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.
Good.
We need you in here for a few minutes
if you can break away.
You're sure holding up fine.
Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.
I guess everybody did.
At least everybody came.
It's the biggest gathering for a funeral
I ever saw in Texas.
It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.
I mean, she always did like
a big get-together.
She'd have had a fine time.
-Come to see us.
-Thank you. Bye-bye.
Come see us.
I think you'll agree, your sister
was a very generous woman.
Now, that little piece of land is worth...
$500, $600 at most.
I'm going to ask you, in reverence
to the memory of Luz Benedict...
I'm going to ask you to give one Jett Rink...
a check for twice the value of that land.
BICK: Come inside, I want to talk to you.
Just a minute, Bick.
I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.
I'm quitting.
I lost the one friend I had in this place,
and I know it, too.
So I quit, I dead quit.
You don't have to say another word to me.
Nobody's firing you.
Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.
I told you, I quit!
Nobody wants to fire you.
Come inside and listen
to what we have to say.
WHITESIDE: Come on in here, Jett.
Come on in, boy.
Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.
-Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.
-Howdy, Jett.
BALE: Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.
You sure look good today.
Sit down. I'm going to tell you about
a piece of luck that's come your way.
WHITESIDE: Sit down, young man,
and make yourself comfortable.
It's a real bad wind
that doesn't blow somebody some good.
BICK: I don't have to tell you that Luz was
a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.
She prepared a list of things she wanted
to give all the people on Reata.
Yes. We find that she wanted to....
We find that her bequest to you was
in the nature of a little piece of ground.
BICK: It's the little piece we used to call
Buffalo Wallow.
She wanted to give you something.
I know she did.
It's always been my aim to try
to keep Reata intact within the family.
Now, that little piece is worth at most....
How much, Bale?
BALE: At the most,
I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor
his sister's wishes...
and, of course, right along
with his own personal feeling for you....
He wants to see to it that you get
something really worthwhile.
Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...
we're prepared to place in your hands,
in cash...
the sum of $1,200.
$1,200...
which, any of these gentlemen here
I'm sure will be happy to tell you...
is twice the value of that land.
PINKY: Definitely.
BALE: At least twice the value of that land.
PINKY: That's a lot of money.
What are you aiming do with all of it?
BALE: You're in the chips now, boy.
There it is. There it is, boy.
And it's all yours.
I don't know what to say.
She sure was a fine lady.
BALE: Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!
PINKY: Amen.
I want you to know
that I appreciate her generosity.
Yours, too, Bick. And you all.
I want to thank you for it.
You know something, Bick?
I don't know, but it might not be...
a pretty good idea
to gamble along with old
How do you mean?
Just gamble on.
Just keep what she gave me.
I'm sentimental, too, Bick.
I think it's good to gamble on with her.
but then someday I just might up...
and put my own fence around her...
and call her Little Reata.
See you.
There's one thing on earth more
important than money, and that's land!
I heard Luz say it a thousand times.
Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!
If you ever get to Deep Smith,
you come and pay us a visit.
We're just on the other side of Umbarger.
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,
only we had a run of luck.
-Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.
-How wonderful.
Right now it's bringing in a million.
-A million gallons?
-Dollars.
A million dollars a year?
A million dollars a month.
Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.
LESLIE: Thank you for coming.
LESLIE: I just love talking to you,
Uncle Bawley.
Now that it's over, you get your fellow...
to take you around
and show you our country.
See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.
I'm so impatient.
I want to see it all right now.
You don't have to hurry, honey.
lt'll be here when you get around to it.
It's been here a long time.
And when you've seen it all
and have lived with it as I have...
in 25 years from now,
you'll feel about Texas just like I do.
Twenty-five years from now!
Twenty-five years from now
I'll be almost 50.
It's a nice age, Leslie.
You'll see wonderful things in Texas
when you're 50.
Perhaps.
But I won't care as much then.
You'll care more.
BALE: Come on,
we need you in the powwow.
BAWLEY: I'm coming, gentlemen.
WHlTESlDE: You get with it, Gómez.
Get your people out.
GOMEZ: Everything will be .
It will be the same: good.
LESLIE: I love you.
BICK: Thank you.
Please, don't mind me.
Do go on.
I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.
You'd be bored, honey.
This is dull.
Why, I'd be fascinated.
We're talking about politics.
You married me in Washington,
remember, darling?
I lived next door to politics.
Brought up with it.
Please go on talking. I'd love it.
This is men's stuff.
ADARENE: Leslie, how about a cup
of coffee or a drink?
Men's stuff!
Lord have mercy!
LESLIE: Set up my spinning wheel, girls.
I'll join the harem section in a minute.
Don't you go worrying
your pretty little head about politics.
LESLIE: You mean my pretty, empty head,
don't you, Judge?
Could I get the coffee for you?
You, too, Uncle Brutus?
You don't feel well, Leslie.
LESLIE: I feel just great!
Boo!
LESLIE: If I may say so before retiring...
you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.
What's so masculine about a conversation
that a woman can't enter into it?
Leslie, you're tired.
LESLIE: Perhaps I am.
I reckon I'll go on upstairs
and get my beauty sleep.
PINKY: You go ahead on, honey.
VASHTI: Good night, gentlemen.
That's right.
Send the children on up to bed
so the grownups can talk.
PINKY: Good night, honey.
I must have dropped off.
Darling, I am sorry
about my caveman speech.
I'll apologize to the others first thing,
I promise.
That's big of you.
You certainly distinguished yourself
this evening.
-Shh, they can hear.
-Hear? They heard you already.
Every word you said out there.
We date back 100,000 years.
I said I was sorry about the name-calling.
It was very impolite, I know.
But in principle, I was absolutely right.
BICK: You come down here
and try to tell us how to run things.
Now you look here, Leslie.
LESLIE: Never!
BICK: Who do you think you are, anyhow?
LESLIE: Jordan, where are you going?
Carrying on like Carrie Nation!
Preaching stuff that's none
of your business, fixing the world.
Why don't you join a club?
Honestly, Jordan.
You make me sound just awful.
I'm not all that bad.
You knew what a frightful girl I was
when you married me.
Anyway, you're stuck with me.
Yes, I guess.
LESLIE: Honey, take your hat off.
Besides...
you love me very much.
That fine mind of yours
gets pretty repulsive at times.
That's not what you told me on the train.
Now you're gonna throw that up to me.
I thought what we....
I thought what we said on the train
was in confidence.
LESLIE: Of course, darling.
You can be pretty wonderful at times.
Come on, partner.
Why don't you kick off your spurs?
LESLIE: What a glorious, gorgeous,
brand-new day!
Let's spend every hour of it, just you and l.
BICK: Honey, I'm beat.
Why?
You have all the good things in the world.
And a woman
who loves you very, very much.
But that arguing takes a lot out of me.
That was just frightful.
BICK: When we make up, we make up.
Don't we, honey?
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?
Just let somebody else run Reata.
Couldn't we?
Honey, I want you to understand this.
I run Reata at all times.
That's the way it is.
Everything that's in it and on it
is run by me.
Don't raise your voice.
That's the way it's always been.
Everything that has a Reata brand on it
is run by me.
Does that include me?
That's the way my father ran this outfit
and my grandfather, too. All of it.
He kept it together for his son,
and my father for his.
And I'm keeping it together for mine.
All 595,000 square miles?
All of it. For my son.
You could at least say "our son."
Our son.
Don't you think that might be
a little too much for one little baby?
Not if he's a Benedict.
You'd better hope this is a boy.
Our baby. I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.
What do you mean?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm telling you now.
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I should know.
-Are you sure?
-Sure.
And our baby is going to be a boy.
I know it.
A boy very much like his father.
In many ways...
but not all.
Shouldn't she be putting on a little weight?
It's natural, I think,
for him to be gaining faster.
Let me see.
Very heavy.
LESLIE: Hello, sweetheart.
He's building up fine.
"l am now stronger than ever.
"I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra
get started here.
"Almost every day I find myself
walking three or four miles...
Hello, Ángel. How are you?
Good.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Gómez, the boss.
Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?
Mr. Gómez, I'm going to leave
Dr. Guerra here with you.
This place is a scandal.
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.
I'll get in touch with you.
LESLIE: Hello, Jett.
JETT: Howdy, Miss Leslie.
LESLIE: How are you?
I'm doing good.
LESLIE: You made some improvements.
JETT: Do you like it?
LESLIE: It looks good.
It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.
LESLIE: I wouldn't have believed it.
JETT: Believed what?
LESLIE: Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort
of talent to be one of your virtues.
JETT: That's the first time I was ever
accused of having any of that.
It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.
JETT: Someday...
I'll have a place
that no one will be ashamed of.
JETT: I cut them out of the newspaper.
LESLIE: Sweet of you.
Do you want to come on in here,
sit down and rest a minute?
LESLIE: Thank you.
Having kids seems to agree with you,
you know?
You're looking prettier than ever.
My goodness, and tea!
JETT: You like tea, don't you?
I love it. It seems down here everybody
drinks gallons of coffee.
JETT: I know.
LESLIE: Mind if I pay you
a rather personal compliment?
What is it?
You make a very excellent cup of tea.
I do a lot of things in a pinch.
Do you like one lump or do you like two?
LESLIE: I think I'll take mine straight.
That's good enough for me.
That's not too good, is it?
When will you get married, Jett?
Don't you need somebody to help you
with this kind of responsibility?
When I get some time to look around,
I'll go back East and....
To Maryland, places like that.
You got any attractive sisters there that
might be interested in some poor people?
Money isn't all, you know?
Not when you've got it.
The other people around here...
why don't they help themselves
like you've done?
When you say "other people,"
what do you mean?
I've just come back from Vientecito.
JETT: That bunch of wetbacks?
You don't go mixing me up
with none of them.
I'm just as much of Texas
as Bick Benedict is.
JETT: I'm no wetback.
LESLIE: I know that.
But your situation is so different.
You're a working man.
That's something I'm gonna try to fix.
Someday I will.
All right, Gómez.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, thank you.
LESLIE: Thanks for the tea party, Jett.
And don't be such a stranger.
I don't know about that.
Bick's still got his kettle on for me.
BICK: Leslie.
Hello, darling.
I was just having tea with Jett Rink.
Gómez telephoned.
"Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.
"I hope you're not displeased," he said.
I've told you before....
What's this about Jett Rink?
He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?
But your man Gómez, that camp he runs....
It's hopeless.
You can't go around this place
with no regard for who you are...
interfering with those people.
Jordan, that place is a scandal.
Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.
That's his problem.
You've been a powerful Texan for
I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.
If you won't, I will.
If you go near those dumps again...
if I ever hear you get mixed up
in this migratory mess--
LESLIE: What?
BICK: I'll leave you!
BICK: That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!
There's my darling little girl.
Did you think your naughty mama was
never going to come up to see you?
One thing you can be sure of:
One of these days I'll run
that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.
BICK: Say hello to Luz. Say, "Hello, Luz."
BICK: Look there. Say hello to little Luz.
I don't care what you say.
She does look like Luz.
Oh, honey.
We're all gathered for the fourth
anniversary of my son's birth.
LESLIE: And your daughter's.
And I want to take
this auspicious occasion...
to say that this young fellow here...
is gonna grow up to be
one of Reata's top hands.
I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.
Girls, look at the pony.
There he is, son.
JORDAN: All mine, Daddy?
JORDAN: No!
Take him around, Ángel.
Take it easy, son.
He doesn't want to.
I rode before I could walk.
But that was you.
He's another person entirely.
He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay
on that saddle if I have to tie him on.
Take him away.
POLO: No.
BICK: Let him ride, Polo.
Let him ride.
Take him up for his nap. I think he's tired.
BICK: That wasn't so bad, was it, son?
BAWLEY: Bick knows everything about
running a ranch. Bone, hide and hair.
He doesn't know a thing
about raising kids...
any more than his father did.
You just stay with it your way...
and help those children grow up to be
what they want to be.
I will, Uncle Bawley. I promise.
PINKY: We're going to hit the hay.
PINKY: Good night, Leslie.
LESLIE: Good night.
PINKY: Good night.
BICK: Good night.
It's time for me to turn in.
-Good night, Bick.
-Good night, Bawley.
VASHTI: Good night, everybody.
Don't forget to turn off the rain.
Are you tired?
LESLIE: No.
Could be.
LESLIE: We've been together
every day and night since we first met.
Is that bad?
LESLIE: No.
about things
we should've adjusted to years ago.
Home?
If you're homesick....
I mean, if that's the way you want it.
LESLIE: That's not the way I want it.
BICK: All right, then.
LESLIE: It'll be better for us
if we're apart for a while.
You know best, I guess.
LESLIE: I think it will be best.
LACEY: Hi.
DR. LYNNTON: 'Morning.
Fine day for riding.
Just magnificent.
See you later.
She's a lucky girl.
If I had it to do again,
I'd still walk off with Jordan.
Even if I knew it'd end like this.
MRS. LYNNTON: You have no time
to be homesick...
with this wedding and Thanksgiving
on us together.
JORDAN: Pedro, come here.
Pedro, eat your dinner like a good boy.
DR. LYNNTON: Father, we bow our heads
in gratitude on this Thanksgiving Day.
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness...
that our land may still yield her increase,
to thy glory and our comfort.
Amen.
Is that Pedro?
Yes, darling.
LESLIE: It's a day
when we're supposed to be happy.
Come on now, smile.
Like Mommy.
Is something wrong, Miss Leslie?
Now maybe you'll stop crying.
It's a message to you from your father.
Is he gonna be here for dinner?
No...
but he says,
"I hope my darlings are all very happy.
"I want them to know I miss them
very much and love each one very much."
I could see you coming.
Why, Mr. Benedict, this is a good surprise!
We're having a wedding.
Sure is plenty of excitement.
MINISTER: "Dearly beloved...
"we are gathered here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...
"to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...
"which is an honorable estate
instituted of God.
"David, wilt thou have this woman
for thy wedded wife?
"To live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?
"Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor her...
"and keep her in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...
"keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?"
I will.
MINISTER: "Lacey, wilt thou have this man
for thy wedded husband...
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?
"and keep him in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...
"keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?"
LACEY: I will.
MINISTER: "Bless, O Lord, this ring...
"that he who gives it and she
who wears it may abide in thy peace...
"and continue in thy favor
unto their life's end.
DAVID: With this ring, I thee wed.
MINISTER: "Those whom God hath joined
together, let no man put asunder.
"I pronounce that they are man and wife."
Are you ready to come back
to your old, beat-up cowhand?
I'm no different than I was when I left.
We Texans like a little vinegar
with our greens. It gives them flavor.
BICK: What do you think of old King Tut?
WHITESIDE: Boy, howdy,
that's some hunk of beef!
BICK: He's gonna make history, too.
When Bick finishes this breeding
program, he'll have an animal...
that's 99 percent beef
and the rest exaggeration.
Say, Ollie, do you see that?
That's Rink's truck.
BICK: I don't want him
hauling through my place.
Jett's got the easement, Bick.
He's got a right to go through the land.
No two ways about that.
I'm tired of his prospecting.
I want him out of here.
He's borrowed about all he could.
He's down to his last collar button.
Sure he is.
Buy him out, Ollie.
Buy him out and get him out of here.
Hello, Jett.
My well came in, Bick.
Fine.
That's wonderful, Jett.
Everybody thought I had a duster.
I'm here to tell you it ain't, boy. It's here.
There ain't a dang thing
you gonna do about it.
And there's more down there, bigger wells.
I'm rich, Bick!
I'm a rich one. I'm a rich boy.
I'm gonna have more money
than you ever thought you could have.
You and the rest of you
stinking sons of Benedicts.
Leslie, go into the house.
Take the women with you.
Jett, we're glad you struck oil.
Now, you go on along home.
My, you sure do look pretty, Miss Leslie.
You always did look pretty.
Pretty, good enough to eat.
Wait a minute.
Take it easy!
You're touchy, Bick.
Touchy as an old cook.
BAWLEY: You should have shot him
a long time ago.
Now he's too rich to kill.
