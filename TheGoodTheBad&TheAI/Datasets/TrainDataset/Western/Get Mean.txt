Woman:
We have been expecting you.
Please, sit down.
Man:
Eat.
Man:
That's $10,000.
- Whose is it?
- For you.
Me?
Our land has been conquered
by a barbaric race.
We would like you to escort
the present heirto the throne
back to our people in Spain
so she can help to lead the army
and overthrow the barbarians.
For many years, a great number
of poor people has sacrificed
to collect this money.
- For what?
- Woman: For me.
I have the great honor to present
Princess Elizabeth Maria de Borgos...
direct descendant
of one of our most noble families.
And we're willing to pay any amount
for her safe conduct to Spain.
Well, I don't know who you are,
and I don't know nothin'
about no barbarians.
Hell, I don't even know where
this place Spain is you're talkin' about.
But I'll tell you one thing
- You raise this pot here...
-
to $50,000 gold,
lady, I'll take you any goddamn place
you want to go.
Is that the kind of respect
you show for royalty?
Look...
business is business,
and I happen to be
a businessman.
And besides,
if I really thought
you were a princess,
well, I'd ask for $100,000.
Let me go!
Where is the girl?
Leave him alone!
He knows nothing!
Where is she?
Let me go!
What the hell is that
supposed to be? Mm!
Excuse me, pal.
This belongs to me.
- What's that?
- It was built by the Moors
when they came here
years ago
to help my people
conquer the barbarians.
In this place, they once kept
the treasure of Rodrigo.
- The what?
- The treasure of Rodrigo.
Who's that?
Our enemies, the barbarians.
What about them?
- The Moors.
- The what?
- The Moors.
- Now, lady,
them people are fixin' to "fonch"
upon one another.
Best we get the hell
out of here.
Get your stuff.
Them's the barbarians, right?
And them's the Moors, right?
Yes.
Now, this is a dangerous country.
They're fightin' everywhere.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on!
Wait!
That's the Moorish army.
They've come to help my people.
- You must do something!
- What do you want me to do?
I command you to help my army!
And I command you
to shut up, lady,
because you're gettin'
on my nerves.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Let's go!
You butchers!
You pigs!
You stupid woman!
You don't understand
who you're speaking to!
No, you are the one
who doesn't understand.
I am a princess,
Elizabeth Maria de Borgos.
Let me welcome you to Spain
and offer you the hospitality
of my humble house.
I accept nothing
that is already mine.
I am the rightful ruler
of this land.
You own nothing
but the army of that man!
Look.
This little woman here
fell off her horse
a few days back
and hurt her head.
Now she's crazy.
Ah, come on, you guys.
If you really think
she's a princess,
you're all crazy.
She's not a princess,
she's an ill-bred bitch!
Just hold on there.
I'm supposed to get $50,000
for delivering her,
whatever she is.
How much is that?
It would buy you 2,000 horses.
Stupid foreigners.
You  to my country,
and you insult me.
- I kill you both!
- Diego!
If I've told you once,
I've told you a hundred times
You must never lose control
in front of the men.
Diego, hang him.
By his feet.
. Huh?
-
Tie his feet!
Hang him!
Now, let's talk this thing over.
We can make a deal.
Hell,  take $25,000.
Hang him!
Hey, come back here!
Where are you going?
Where are you going,
you bunch of foreigners?
You can't treat a man like this!
Hey! Cut me down!
I ain't no goddamn dog!
You barbaric sons of bitches!
I'm gonna get you!
I'll kill you!
'Cause I ain't leaving this country
until I get my damn money!
we salute you!
We thank you for this victory!
There's the Emir.
Get him.
Come on.
My name is Morelia.
You are among friends.
Well, lady,
I'll tell you,
I sure could use a friend.
Morelia:
This is the princess's Emir,
the general of her army.
No.
He's dying.
Listen, ask him
about my money, will ya?
There's no way to pay you
until Rodrigo's treasure
has been found.
Look, lady, a deal's a deal.
I was supposed to bring her to you,
and I did,
and now I want my $50,000.
He's dying!
Please, tell us
the secret of the treasure.
The princess...
is the only one
who can claim the treasure.
Morelia:
Please, Emir, we have to know.
You are dying.
Where is she?
If?
Mosque Vesuvius.
What'd he say?
Mosque Vesuvius.
The what?
It's a temple in the mountains.
Oh, dear God,
they got everything
in this country!
And what do I got, lady?
Well, I'll tell you what I got.
I got nothin'.
Nothing!
-
-
Hold on, there.
- What's going on?
- Diego's men are searching the town.
Come on!
-
'
-
'
You barbarian fellas
think it's funny
to hang a man by his feet,
don't ya?
Now, you go back and tell your boss
I'm comin' in,
and I want to make a deal
about the treasure.
Okay?
This is the Ancient Fortress
of Rodrigo.
- All right, you wait for me here.
- Be careful.
Gypsy girl,
my old lady never raised
no dummies.
Where's your boss?
Well, get that animal out of the way,
and I'll take you to him.
Eat.
Laugh.
Enjoy yourselves!
Now, nobody get nervous...
because I come in peace.
Take a look at this stuff, Chief.
Beads. Pretty beads.
-
-
How 'bout a new kind
of looking glass...
I bring from big country
America.
Don't be shy. Take it.
All right.
How 'bout this?
That's a nice hat for your wife.
I have six wives.
Oh, looks like you've been robbing
the cradle, there, Chief.
You insult me!
First you demand
I pay $50,000 for the princess!
Then...
you kill six
six of my men!
And now...
you dare to tell me...
you come in peace!
If he kills me,
you'll never get your treasure!
Treasure? What treasure?
The treasure of Rodrigo.
Where? Where is it?
Give it to me!
I ain't givin' him nothin'.
You tell him I'll trade him even up
the princess for the treasure.
- I'll kill you!
- Diego!
All right. Take him.
He's yours.
You'd better come with me.
I think it's time
we had a little talk.
Have you ever read Shakespeare?
- Who?
-
No, I don't suppose
you would know him.
Shakespeare.
He wrote a great many plays--
Hamlet, Othello, Richard III.
Dear Richard.
Richard was
a very interesting man.
He was a hunchback.
You might say...
he is my idol.
All right, Richard.
Well, thank you.
Oh, you son of a gun!
But how do you pick one of them?
Oh, they're not for me.
They're for them.
Mm-hmm!
But don't they get nervous
with those guys watching up there?
No, no. Those guys are blind.
This guy's a cripple.
A hunchback.
And he's crazy.
Completely crazy.
But he must be doing
something right.
Damn.
I've been trying to make a deal
with the wrong guy.
Tell me, do you like
what you have seen?
Are you kiddin', Richard?
I've been waitin' all my life
for somethin' like that.
Well, perhaps I can arrange
for you to have it.
Come with me.
Sombra:
See?
We have taken very good care
of your friend.
Now perhaps we can reach some...
agreement between us.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
What about Diego?
Where does he fit into this thing?
Never mind about Diego.
This is between you and I.
- Okay, Richard, I --
- My name is not Richard!
.*:f_ j
Now, I know where the treasure is,
but I need the little woman
to claim it.
All right.
I'll release her, and then we'll go
and claim it together...
partner.
Princess: I don't know what kind
of arrangement you have made,
but I will not go anywhere
with this man.
Now, look.
I don't care nothin' about him,
I don't care nothin' about that treasure,
and I don't care nothin' about you.
You don't care nothing
about anything.
Right.
I just want to get my money
and get out of this trashy
goddamn country of yours.
But you know
we can't trust him.
One thing at a time, lady.
One thing at a time.
How would you girls like to visit
the States someday?
Oh, dear God,
they got some ugly-looking women
in this country.
Sombra:
Hey, partner.
I think you'd better come inside.
I can't worry about danger.
This is something I must do.
Now, where do you think
you're going?
This is not your affair.
Look, lady,
until I get my money,
everything's my affair.
Now, somebody tell me what the hell's
going on around here.
I'm sorry. This is one
of our most sacred traditions.
The princess will not be able
to claim the treasure
unless she makes the long journey
through the trials of death.
- The what?
- Man: The trials of death,
a venture full of magic
and the unknown.
They are the only way
to claim Rodrigo's treasure.
After many men had died
in the attempt,
a time came when
no one else would try.
So the tradition and the secret
of the treasure
were lost and forgotten.
Man:
Now, mister, you're crazy.
We got a little woman here.
Now, if all them guys got killed tryin',
how do you expect her to do it?
She doesn't have to.
If the heir apparent
is a woman or a child,
a loyal subject
who must carry no weapon
may be appointed instead.
But she insists on going.
I'm going,
and nobody can stop me.
I'll not only stop you,
but I'll break
your goddamn legs for you.
Now, we got a problem here.
We got a serious problem here.
All right, what are we gonna do
about this thing?
Well, I could certainly do
this kind of thing better than you.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
However, there is
one small problem.
What's that?
Well, you know how it is
when one's crippled.
You'll have some good days...
and some bad.
And today is just one of those
bad days, right?
Ah.
You know, I'm really happy
you came along, partner.
That's very nice
of you to say.
All right, what do I have to do?
-
-
-
-
-
-
Now, all you people
in them coffins,
I don't believe
in this kind of stuff.
You hear me?
So don't be trying to turn me
into no damn wolf.
-
-
Hey!
Anybody home?
Oh!
Oh, my God, I'm black!
I'm dyin'!
-
-
Now, what the hell
kind of treasure is that?
Maybe it's old or something.
- What happened?
-
Tell me what happened in here.
They...
There. You see?
I told you.
They plotted together.
Where is my treasure?
But, mister,
now you've got to
get me a doctor,
because I've turned black all over,
and I think I'm gonna die.
Search him!
-
-
Oh, my God!
Zepeda's necklace!
- The Scorpion's Sting.
- Man: The what?
It's called the Scorpion's Sting.
Death comes to whoever claims it.
They say El Cid had it at Valencia.
Three days later...
he was dead!
Shut up!
Give it to him!
T-Take it.
Take it.
You take it, or I'll drive this dagger
through your black throat.
All right.
Hell, that's a nice necklace.
-
- What?
Nothing.
- It was nothing.
- Why do you laugh?
Please, Diego.
In another moment,
you'll lose your temper and he'll be dead,
and then you'll never
find your treasure.
Don't listen! Don't listen.
He tried to betray you.
That's right, Diego.
Listen to
Our little butterfly,
who'd sell his mother for the price
of a new hat with feathers!
Now, come.
Come, sweet counselor.
Tell us.
If I did betray Diego for the treasure,
where is it?!
I...
I d-- I don't know.
That's right.
You don't know, do you?
You think that
Diego is a fool,
that you can whisper anything
that you like into his ears
and he will believe you
well, you're wrong!
Diego knows better than that.
He knows that if I had this treasure
in my hands, I would bring it to him!
- Bullshit.
-
We will dedicate
this human sacrifice
in memory of Rodrigo!
-
-
There's no real reason for you
to share the same fate as your friend.
- Just tell me where the treasure is.
-
Bring me swords!
If you won't tell me, then take
your secret to the grave with you.
Take up the sword
or take up me.
Well, come on!
I'm begging to be killed!
Well, it looks like
I drew first blood.
- Why, hello.
-
It's a shame to waste
a beautiful woman like you.
-
-
All right.
Everybody go out.
Everybody go out!
Oh, I'm glad I didn't shoot
you two bastards.
- It would've been too quick.
-
Hold your head up high!
You're the guest of honor
at our feast tonight!
You see, partner,
the flames are very low,
so it's up to you
whether you'll be rare,
medium, or well done.
Sombra: When you decide
to tell us where the treasure is,
we'll be waiting.
Let's go.
Would you like me to help you?
Well, I will.
But you...
you must help me.
Anything.
Anything you want.
- I want the treasure.
- I've got the treasure.
Where is it? Where is it?
I got it.
I'll take you to it.
All right. All right.
But if you're lying,
well, this...
this will seem like child's play
to what I'll do to you.
Understand?
I-I ain't lyin'.
L\ :':f;::;r":L: 'T'::':f1.:::: 5'51 :...?' I: "5 '7"'°"'--
Get him. Goon!
'
- No! No!
Has a stranger been here today?
No.
If he comes here, my friend,
you'd better keep your doors
closed to him,
or we'll burn this village
and everything in it to the ground!
Is Diego afraid
of this pretty little necklace
like everybody else around here?
All of Spain is afraid of that.
- Good. Now, turn around!
-
But-- but I thought you said
the treasure was here.
Where is it?
Little sister,
you're gonna find out...
that I am the biggest goddamn liar
you ever met.
- Now, don't turn around.
-
Now, you're gonna deliver
a message to Diego for me.
No, please. No, don't make me do it.
I won't do it!
No! No, you can't make me do it!
- Now, listen to me, you little worm,
-
or I'll kill you if you don't.
Close your eyes
and open your mouth!
Swallow!
I said to swallow!
- Swallow!
-
Oh, please, no!
You will be stuffed,
my little goose,
until your message is delivered.
More food!
Now, when things are even-up,
a man really should fight fair.
But, oh, when they just keep
puttin' it to you, buddy,
and they're stom pin'
on your ass,
there's only one way to fight:
The Scorpion's Sting!
-
-
ain't no white man alive gonna handle
them barbarian whores.
Oh, God.
Humph!
I challenge you to a duel.
Guns? Whips?
Chains? Knives?
- It's your choice.
- Oh...
Hmm? You insult me?
'
'
- Ow!
-
Oh, what a crazy country.
The women are men,
and the men are women.
What do we do now?
Well, what do you got
in mind, lady?
-
- Havin' a couple drinks?
L:}3 : r :?
Or if you like, we could take
a little walk in the moonlight.
What's happening?
- What's going on?
-
Go! Quickly!
You, men! To the cannons!
To the cannons!
All you men,
come with me!
Sombra:
To the door! To the door!
Goddamn! Son of a bitch!
Hie!
Move!
Move!
You go that way.
The rest of you come with me.
To the door!
- Close the door! Close it!
-
Hurry:
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?
Come back!
Come back!
I.
Where the hell you been?
You wait for me outside.
Now, get your hands up.
I said, get your hands up!
What do you say there,
big fella?
Looks like we're starting
to understand each other.
- Right?
'
Now, this is what I call
a scorpion's sting.
No! No!
No! No!
No!
Now, any man who would try to
roast a fella like a pig
is trash.
But you're worse than trash.
You're garbage.
Garbage, buddy.
Man:
Hey, Richard! Hey, Richard!
Hey, Richard!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!
- Get going.
- Bring her here!
Tie her to the wagon.
I think I'm gonna give you till sunrise
to get out of Spain!
You've lost your mind!
This is my country!
This is my kingdom!
You can't tell me to leave!
No!
It-It's a hidden cave!
Oh, my God!
It's Rodrigo's treasure!
Sombra:
Shh!
It's been right here
under our noses all the time.
Of course. Of course!
Here, in Rodrigo's ancient fortress.
Wait! Listen to me!
This is madness,
trying to kill each other.
There's a fortune here!
Let's come to some agreement.
Let's-— let's make a deal!
Man:
All right.
But first, let the princess go.
He must be here.
Go get him. Kill him!
_'
You want to share in this treasure,
you'll do as I say. Now, go on!
Ha!
When the butterfly goes
too nearthe flames...
Alfonso: Sombra, he's not in here.
Why did you lock the door?
...he gets burned!
- Alfonso: No, Sombra. Sombra!
-
Sombra, let me out.
Let me out!
Oh! Oh,  God!
No!
Let me out! Let me out!
If“ I?
No! No!
Som bra!
No!
No!
Now, that's one hell of a way
to treat a princess, ain't it'?
You okay?
Wait for me inside, all right?
My leg.
My leg!
Oh, please, let me go.
I couldn't sleep nights
if I let you go.
Only... give me a chance.
Just... give me a chance.
I'll give you a chance.
Just like you gave
that little gypsy girl.
Get up. Get up!
How dare you talk
to me like that?
You think I'm just another
pitiful hunchback
limping my way through life!
No, no. Don't be fooled
by my appearance.
I am Richard!
Richard, king of all of England!
- Okay, Richard!
-
If you're a king,
you'll understand this real good.
I challenge you to a duel.
You got your cannon,
I got mine.
- Huh?
- Now, you go for it.
I said, go for it!
Now is the winter of our discontent,
made glorious summer
by this son of York.
And all the clouds
that lowered upon this house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried!
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths,
our bruised arms
hung up for monuments,
our stern alarums
changed to merry meetings,
our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.
- I.'f:Lj« Hi IT 'i /1 ? --'=;..:7 I: :352::~.~::1 :;:':,ll::jl 'i;"f§ I  I;-1
hath smoothed
his wrinkled front!
Deformed,
unfinished...
...sent before my time
into this breathing world,
scarce half made up,
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them!
A horse! A horse!
My-H
-
-
A horse...
The king is dead.
Long live the king.
Or whatever they say.
