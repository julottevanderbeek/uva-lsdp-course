Shit!
God dammit.
BUBBA: Langley. Langley!
oh, shim.
BUBBA: Langley, come in.
This is Bubba.
Come in! Are you there, Langley?
-Langley!
-Yeah, Bubba.
Dammit Langley, I've been trying
to get you for half an hour.
I've been practicing.
To hell with your
fast-draw merit badges
get them damn headphones off
and answer a ca!! now and then.
Bubba, I'm not even on till two.
Yeah, you are.
Guess who didn't show up
for the wedding.
Don't tell me. Little old
Katie Barrett got stood up
at the altar?
Other way around.
Ain't funny either.
Her daddy's fit to be tied
and a Border Patrol chopper
seen a Mercedes or something
out in the desert near Red Rock
about a half hour ago.
I'm not more than a couple miles
from there. I'll go take a look.
I'm sure the people
of Riverton County
would be mighty
grateful for that.
And your ass better be out there
before I am.
Sweet talker.
Nice slide but, you're late.
LANGLEY: Jesus.
Damn pissant cars.
Must've been one hell
of a sandstorm.
Something tells me
this was no sandstorm.
Could he.
And maybe, old Lyle's
little girl
got herself into some
real trouble this time.
LANGLEY: Or maybe Old Lyle could
have avoided it
if he hadn't been so damn quick
to buy her out of jail
every time I brought her in
for "drunk and disorderly."
BUBBA: It sure the hell
don't look good.
BUBBA: Libbie, come on in.
Hustle your bustle, Libbie.
Libbie, you read me or not?
HM!
I better go in and try to
rustle up some boys
with four wheels so we can
do some looking.
BUBBA: Hell of a
big desert though.
You best stay with the car until
I get somebody out here
and check it for prints.
Just in case.
You keep that heavy metal
hearing aid out of your ear
so you can hear
the damn radio.
Be careful.
Sheriff, pick up.
God dammit, Bubba, pick up!
Aah!
Jesus Christ!
Let go of me!
SKELETON: You're the one.
You'll rid my town of evil.
Don't fail or risk a fate
worse than death.
LANGLEY: Ugh.
SKELETON: Go now.
on, yeah.
Ah.
LANGLEY: Miss Barrett?
Can I help you?
LANGLEY: Who the hell are you?
I am the dealer.
A man of chance.
I know when you come to town.
-I know when she--
-She?
Mister, don't mess with me.
You know where Kate Barrett is,
you sure as hell
better let me know.
And now.
I'd be hard pressed to say.
People come... people go.
Like towns... they turn to dust.
A man looking for a woman.
Story of my life.
Story of every man's life,
I suppose.
Wet your whistle over her.
-What?
-A drink.
A shot of rye makes every
man's story go a might easier.
Don't have the time, sorry.
Time is all we got,
in Cruz del Diablo.
Your future will wait
till you get there.
It's the past you
can't do anything about.
LANGLEY: Look mister, I don't
have the--
Another, Sheriff?
I always said I could spot
a thirsty man at least a mile.
Did you see those people?
What?
I take a... dim view of
scatter guns in my place.
Excepting the one I keep
under the bar, of course.
But seeing as you being the law.
Can you help me?
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what the hell
is going on.
But, I am a cop.
Why don't you start by
telling me who you are?
Need help?
I'll be most willing to try.
Can you tell me where
I can make a call?
Call?
Telephone, CB, radio, anything,
I just need to check in.
Telegraph.
Fine. Where?
I had one but line's been down
most every day.
Wind, more than likely why
they took it away, I suppose.
But, if you'd be so kind
as to tell me...
What you're after.
A girl.
Man on a black horse.
Well, you would
not be the first.
Drink it up.
On the house.
Thanks.
To madness.
Oh, yeah.
Lady?
Hey!
Hey!
LANGLEY: Hey.
Get inside, girl. Quick.
LANGLEY: Hey.
Listen, my Bronco's all
busted up, back there.
I was wondering about that.
Man ain't much
without a horse.
No, no, no, my Bronco,
my four wheeler.
All right look, I'm looking
for a girl.
You better try the saloon
then, friend.
You. Come on, come on out here.
Come on.
She'll do you no harm.
Go on, girl.
Go back inside.
Go, go... go.
Look.
I'm with the Riverton County
Sheriff Department, see?
I'm chasing a man
on a black horse.
Looks just like this one.
You don't belong here, boy.
Whatever way you got here,
go back
while you still have the chance.
'Cause you don't want what...
What's here.
Best listen to him next time,
pilgrim.
Well now...Law Man.
There's no law here
in a long time.
-Ain't that right, Billy?
- Oh, yeah.
BILLY: Been a long time.
Easy boys, I'm not looking
for trouble.
That's a mighty big gun
for a peaceful man.
Why you here, Law Man?
Yeah, how come?
That's none of your business.
And if I beg to differ?
ME l5007
The fancy scatter gun.
You hand it over to Billy here.
-Real slow...
-Real slow.
LANGLEY: You want to be
real careful with this.
It's got a touchy trigger.
Real slow.
Now Ned?
See you in hell, Law Man.
Maybe.
-
NED: Billy!
ETTA: Easy.
LANGLEY: What? What?
You.
Smithy brought you.
He says you could be a good man.
Are you not?
Who are you?
I=lTEI
After my grandma.
Where are my clothes?
Blood... blood on 'em.
Needed washing.
I'll just take those things.
You got something on that
I never saw before.
You've never seen
a zipper before?
Zipper?
And how does it work?
It just does.
Like a lot of things
where I come from.
And where would that be?
Darlin', I'm not all that sure
I know any more.
Others have come
and tried before.
Put an end to this place.
Is that why you think I'm here?
It'd be to let us go to heaven.
Or hell fire.
Did you ever see this before?
I... I don't remember.
Do you know
who this belongs to?
NF!
I really need to know.
Sheriff...
Sheriff Harper.
Clint Harper?
Been such a long time
since I heard the name.
How long?
Please don't.
Sweetheart, I'm not gonna
hurt you.
But, I really need to know.
How long?
How long?
Forever.
Please.
Touch me.
Did I not help you?
Touch me.
Please.
Make me feel.
Just once more.
No, God dammit, no.
To MAS: Dias,
Langley was in one hell
of an accident.
CLETUS: Accident hell.
Accident's when the June bug
flies up your ass...
And this ain't June.
Get on the horn with Libbie
and tell her to call everybody in.
TOMAS: Yes, sir.
Tell her to call Old Lyle
and let him know that
we still ain't found Kate.
And Tomas,
he don't need to know
we're missing a deputy, too.
Oh, for your sake Langley...
I sure hope it was
the wind that done this...
I hope it was.
KATE: Get away from me!
Please don't touch me again.
The same as Rose McBrich.
In the beginning...
But she learned.
Who's Rose?
What did you do to her?
She betrayed me but once,
with a deputy...
No other will...ever.
So young.
Very...
Like Rose.
KATE: You don't understand.
My father's got money.
You can have anything you want.
I know.
You fucking freak!
MAN: Sssh!
You must quiet
your pretty mouth
or you shall find me
most vengeful.
-
-
-
-
HARPER: Don't let it
come to this.
Not a one of you got
the stomach to stop it.
It's come time,
for the men among you
to come out
to stand by me as deputy.
Damn you all to the hell
you deserve.
I'm comin' for ya, Devlin.
GRACE: NO!
Get back, Grace.
It's time.
Oh, please.
Oh!
Stop!
Ugh!
Look, Harper.
Look!
You'll suffer for this.
My pain...
Will be your pain.
I will not rest...
Nor will this town,
Till you die, Devlin.
You will rot!
Where's your God now, Harper?
You were there.
I saw you take Harper's gun.
How did you?
I thought no one saw.
Jesus Christ.
Buried alive and none of you
did a god damned thing.
I didn't steal it.
I'm a good girl, see.
Here, you take it.
Wait a minute.
If you were there,
how can you be here?
LANGLEY: Now?
Here? Now?
Smithy and me, ones like us
are trapped somehow.
The others, the voices
you hear in the night
are souls lost between
heaven and hell, I think.
Did he kill 'em?
All of them?
What's his name?
NF!
Please, no.
If I tell you and he hears me,
he'll make me one of the voices.
LANGLEY: No, I won't
let it happen.
It won't happen, okay?
His name?
Devlin.
Devlin.
Devlin.
Devlin.
LANGLEY: Thanks.
She's been had by
worse than you.
Lots worse.
I didn't mean for that.
I meant for helping me.
-Name's Langley.
-I don't want to know your name.
I'll read it soon enough
on your headstone.
Maybe.
You better know how to use that
big iron of yours real good.
Because if you don't kill him,
you're going to make things
real bad on the rest of us.
Real bad.
I'm good enough.
Took care of those two didn't I?
Before he grazed me.
You protect her.
You hide her, don't you?
Just a child.
She's like a daughter to me.
There ain't no hiding.
Not in this town.
Not from Devlin.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I'll be back.
I hope so.
He knows, Smithy.
He knows what you've done
for the Law Man.
Get out of here.
Unless you want this shovel
down your britches... Get out.
You'll be the one to burn,
Smithy.
Devlin will see to that.
Get out.
Hello, Sheriff.
Ruined a good shirt, you did.
How-do, Law Man?
Oh, shim.
What the hell is goin' on here?
GFECE.
DEALER: Bets, gentlemen, bets.
Morning.
Grace, I've seen you.
You knew Harper.
I need answers.
The answers come easier
later in the day, Law Man.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. That's the girl,
that's the girl that I'm after.
GRACE: It's Rose McBrich.
She used to sing here.
But she got her singing career
cut short
you might say, ear to ear.
Devlin.
Look, I don't know exactly
what happened here
and God knows, I don't
want to know when.
But, this Devlin
is some kind of freak.
And he has got the girl that
I'm after. Now I know that.
Worse, I think he's been
doing this for years.
And I think you know.
I think you all know
but you've never had the guts
to do anything about it.
I think you all know
where Devlin is.
Only you're too damn afraid
to say it.
The gun.
The gun. Can I see it, please?
A friend gave it to me.
Ah, yes.
Friends are hard to come by
these parts.
Could I keep it?
I guess you got more right to it
than I do.
DEALER: Best not jawbone
the boy to death, Grace.
Come on, son.
Sit a hand.
How about you, Dealer?
You're a man of chance.
Care to take one?
Where is Devlin?
Like cards and the devil.
Some things cnme
in their own time.
Cut for luck.
Or maybe your fortune.
Is something funny, mister?
I didn't come here to gamble.
I want to know where Devlin is.
Perhaps, the answer
lies in the cards.
You cutting cards
or telling fortunes?
Maybe a little bit of both,
Sheriff, a little bit of both.
Take a chance.
Eight of clubs.
Lucky at cards again.
You said answers and how
the hell can you read cards?
Handle a card enough times
and you get to know it.
Go on, cut again.
All right, what's it mean?
Death, Law Man.
DEALER: Uh, huh.
DEALER: Cards, Law Man.
Death.
It seems there is someone
waiting for you downstairs.
You best hurry
lest you miss him.
Who?
It matters not.
So very, very like Rose.
We shall see if you
sing as well.
Sing?
Or die.
Two of Devlin's best men.
Where?
Clint Harper's badge.
He picked you.
Maybe.
Miss Rose has been so kind
as to offer to sing.
DEALER: Wrong call,
wrong card, Law Man.
Miss Rose.
Sing.
Umm...
Mmazing grace J*
J* How sweet J'
-
-Stop!
-
-Stop!
Sing me one of your songs, Rose.
Play.
All right, that's it.
You stay away from her.
Oh my God, Langley
get me out of here!
DEVLIN: I said, sing.
The lady stays.
I'm telling you one more time.
Now do it.
DEVLIN: Like I said,
the lady stays.
YOU Want me LEW Man?
Outside in the street.
DEVLIN: Unless you want
to back shoot me.
Langley, what the hell did you
let him go for?
To save your life.
DEVLIN: Sheriff!
Oh, no, no, no, no, you're not
going out on the street.
You get shot up, I don't have a
chance in hell of getting out of here.
You don't have a chance.
That's rich.
And I don't have much choice.
Langley, take this.
This'll do the job.
I'll be back.
The house stands ten to one
against that.
I'll take that bet.
Always did like
a good hanging, Law Man.
Ugh!
LANGLEY: I've seen your hell,
Devlin.
Now, I'm gonna show you mine.
Everybody seems to think
there's no way to stop you.
I say dead is dead.
DEVLIN: Not always.
LANGLEY: I got no fight
with your men.
Just you.
DEVLIN: Done.
Your move, Law Man.
LANGLEY: I'm gonna do this
by the book.
You have the right
to remain silent.
You have the right to-- Shit!
DEVLIN: You best try again,
Law Man.
Fine shootist.
I give you that.
But it brings you no good.
Fine piece of iron.
Ought to belong
to a man, though.
A beautiful killing thing.
DEVLIN: Dying time, Sheriff.
KATE:  No, no, no,
you leave him alone.
Spare the rod, spoil the child.
KATE:  Run!
Langley, run!
After him, you fool!
Aah!
And make sure she's
locked up this time.
Law Man!
The things you brought
will not work.
You must use the old things.
WET!-
Thanks.
Kill him.
Kill Devlin and let
this town die.
BILLY: Aah!
You shot me real this time.
Help me!
For Christ's sake, Billy!
-Is he there?
-No, he's gone.
He's killed.
He can't be killed.
Killed's dead.
I'm saying killed dead.
Same as Jake.
Same as Cletus.
Peckerwood killed him.
Stone dead.
No matter.
Maybe, except I ain't in such a
hurry to get into a blaze myself.
Me neither.
Then you find him.
Find him!
I got business
with others first.
One under the bar.
Thank you, Grace.
KATE:  No!
God!
Jesus Christ, Langley,
I could have killed you.
Close enough.
-Come on.
-He's dead right?
He's not dead?
DEVLIN: Blacksmith.
Oh, Blacksmith,
you disappoint me.
Be a good thing you are used
to the heat, Blacksmith.
Men like you and me
know the flame well.
And the perfume...
Of burning flesh.
You go and greet the devil.
Oh, I have.
I have.
Give him best regards.
This is where you hide.
COME.
Come, I shan't hurt you...
Very much.
Oh, he hurt me, Langley.
He really hurt me.
I don't wanna die in this place.
I don't wanna die in this place
and become one of them.
And part of it forever.
-We'll get out of here.
-No, we're not.
I tried running,
and they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
Trust me.
I am going to get us
out of here.
Oh my God, we got to go now.
I=lTEI
LANGLEY: Etta?
Langley.
I'm sorry.
I promised her...
I promised her.
He said we should hide
in the church.
Now you try to find
some bullet moulds.
And look for some gun powder.
KATE: Langley? Langley.
It's all here.
That's great.
Now is no time.
We'll end up like them.
All right.
LANGLEY: Why don't you look
around, see what you can find.
Oh, shim.
LANGLEY: What is it?
KATE: I just found
what's left of the priest.
Evil has no sanctuary here.
That's comforting.
LANGLEY: Found some kerosene.
Now let's hope the good people
of Cruz del Diablo,
were more generous in coin
than they were in spirit.
Give me a hand here.
Jackpot.
Get a fire going.
This ought to be interesting.
I don't even know how
to use a microwave.
Oh, shim.
-What?
-Rock salt.
It's good for clearing bars,
but nothing else.
It's crude shot,
but it might work.
What are you doing? Do you have
any idea what these are worth?
Our lives.
Kate, I want you to walk.
Very quietly...
Don't ask anything.
Get down!
\lFR1
Running from the fire,
all of you.
Expected more from you, Dealer.
And expect much now, Devlin.
No more dealer.
No more game.
Yes, my sightless friend.
You were useful once.
But now it's my game.
And I no longer need you.
I thought after Harper
you'd learned.
Learned to hate you is all.
Ah, but most people do.
And I feed on it.
Someone told about the church.
Most disloyal.
But the one who told
about the old things
is the one I want.
Queen of hearts...
I think it was you.
They surely in the church.
And look here.
Peckerwood done shot him
full of nails.
Made a pin-cushion
out of old Teddy.
Let's burn them out.
Let's burn th--
Bob!
Sharpen your razor.
It will sing tonight.
You know, these gold
slugs are gonna mushroom?
What?
Make a mess of anything
they hit.
What are you doing over there?
Found a way to use
the extra gun powder.
You did, huh?
Yeah.
They're surely up to
something in there.
The priest tried hiding
from me there also.
But little good it did him.
His God was deaf to his screams
the night I visited him.
Weasel.
Watch out for them.
They must not escape me.
I ain't going in after 'em.
Going to hell, you are.
Being a reasonable man,
let me help you go.
Anyone else wishing
not to go to church?
KATE: This is great.
Langley, you hear that?
I hear voices.
Who doesn't in this place?
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?
KATE: There's so many of 'em.
How are we going
to get out of here?
Let's arrange a little
greeting for our visitors.
There is nothing to fear,
you cowards.
Time to die, Sheriff.
Get him!
LEW Man?
Sheriff?
Where are you, Law Man?
Here, come out and play!
Get out here, Law Man.
Sheriff.
Ned, the...
Run!
Get up!
DEVLIN: Get up, you cowards.
DEVLIN:
Where are you, Law Man?
DEVLIN:
There's no escaping my town.
DEVLIN:
Where are you?
LANGLEY: Oh, Jesus.
LANGLEY: Oh, Christ.
Oh, Christ.
Son of a bitch!
Let's get out of here.
And I mean now.
DEVLIN: There is nowhere
to hide, Sheriff.
You cannot escape
Cruz del Diablo.
Jesus, what was in there?
Leftovers.
Damn you.
HM!
Nice shot.
I was aiming for Devlin.
Get down!
DEVLIN: Aah!
It burns.
Damn you, Harper.
Aah!
Do you realize
you can't kill me?
Finally, a weapon worthy of me.
First mistake in 100 years.
It's five shots, Devlin!
Rest In Peace, Harper.
I will haunt these streets
for a thousand years.
Aah!
He's dead.
He's dead.
He's dead.
We're out of here.
KATE: What happened?
LANGLEY: Town's gone.
LANGLEY: There's nothing left.
