Rafe.
Rafe.
You'll do it, Rafe?
You gave me your word.
I'll do it.
I ain't afraid of dying.
What's that you told me?
"'Tis a poor thing
to fear the inevitable."
Right.
Who said it?
Someone who wasn't dying.
That's good advice...
...but hard to follow.
Excuse me.
What are you doing, Covington?
You don't open the captain's door
without permission.
You sure as hell
don't cross that threshold.
I'll beat you within an inch
of your life...
...for what you did to Charles Rodney.
Charles Rodney got what he deserved.
Rafe, come on, we gotta get going.
Cape Mendocino coming up.
We've got to cast off.
That will do it.
Mutiny.
Mutiny.
- What's the tariff on that?
- Hanging.
I reckon we better not get caught.
You're turned out like a rooster
for the harvest fair.
One lousy shirt. Because he runs off
and leaves a chest full of gold.
The rest wasn't back wages.
So what?
We need a little
target practice here.
With that you'll
just make them angry.
- One's all we need.
- They're just buffalo.
- They'll be gone soon enough.
- Gone?
They're thick as flies
on a bull's ass!
Ten years from now,
they'll be nothing but a memory.
A Frenchman, a German and an Irishman
go into a saloon and order whiskeys.
The drinks arrive
with a fly in each one.
The Frenchman says,
I can't drink this!"
The German flicks the fly out
and drinks it down.
The Irishman grabs the fly,
he turns it upside down and he says:
"Spit it out!
Spit it out!"
How long you staying?
Long as it takes.
You, J. T?
Long as it takes.
I owe it to Charlie.
What about you, leprechaun?
Thanks to our honest friend here,
I'm still a little short on funds.
Those gold mines in Montana
are still calling my name.
'Tis kindly I'm thanking you.
Well, I hope you find
your pot of gold, Rock.
May the apple of your eye
see only good...
...and may God make smooth
the path before you.
See you in Wyoming
for Christmas goose.
This the Rodney spread?
Forty thousand acres Charlie purchased
from the Sioux Chief Red Cloud.
Well, it ain't heaven...
...but it's near enough.
Close as we're likely to get.
Why, Mrs. Rodney...
...sure ain't much of a housekeeper.
You get started here, J.T.
I'll be back.
What can I get for you, friend?
I'd like to order some supplies.
Ten pounds each bacon, beans...
...flour and coffee.
A pound each of sugar, salt, jerky...
...and some rolling tobacco.
A long ride or a long stay?
That the new Centennial model?
Yes, sir.
Winchester's first
big-bore lever gun.
That carbine's 45-60.
Case-colored receiver
and factory engraved.
Special order?
The customer died before it came in.
Thirty-two dollars.
Fella must have
come into some money.
"Moonlight Sonata."
You don't look like a man
who knows Beethoven.
I don't.
My mother used to play that.
Really?
Don't I look like a man
who had a mother?
I guess I was condescending.
You were.
I read Beethoven used to wear
his clothes till they came apart...
...and fell off his body.
You can read.
Another surprise.
Even write a word or two. Short ones.
A wit.
It's rare in these parts.
Rare as sassy women, I expect.
And I suppose you prefer your women
ignorant and docile.
Yes, ma'am.
You're amusing enough, Mr?
Rafe Covington, ma'am.
Ann Rodney.
Mr. Covington?
Mrs. Rodney...
...your husband sent me here.
My husband has been dead
for more than a year.
You must be mistaken.
I must be.
Where can I get a drink?
Bruce Barkow's saloon, the National.
I'll pick up those supplies
in a day or two.
Thank you. Ma'am.
Sir.
Well...
...he sure is an interesting fellow.
He could use a bath.
- What'll it be?
- What are my options?
I got whiskey...
...whiskey and...
Whiskey.
You catch on fast.
To Charles Rodney.
May he rest in peace.
Amen.
Yes, sir.
Good man.
Sheriff Moncrieff.
Also justice of the peace...
...both of which are in short supply
in these parts.
Rafe Covington.
Obliged.
Haven't heard Rodney's name
spoken around here for some time.
Sad end.
Well, those Sioux raiding parties...
...frequent that Wind River Trail.
Did you catch them?
No, sir. Never even found
poor Charlie's body.
Bastards carried him off
like a bunch of crows.
I seen it all.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why?
Must have been upsetting for you.
Get up!
Go on, now!
You want the postman, the barber,
or the undertaker?
Barber.
Should have figured.
New face in town...
...ain't likely to
have mail just yet.
Well...
...the barber...
...is in.
- Shave and a bath.
- Shave first.
No sense getting blood...
...all over a clean body.
It ain't polite
to follow people around.
- Joe.
- Wylie.
I'm Joe Gill.
Suit yourself, young fella.
I used to work for Charles Rodney.
He was a hell of a good man.
Yes, he was.
I wish I'd been with him
on that trip.
Things just might have
turned out different.
Where was he going?
Wasn't going anywhere.
He was coming back
from San Francisco.
Business.
Excuse me.
That awful day on the Wind River Trail,
how big was that Sioux raiding party?
I don't recall.
Five...
...six maybe.
What was Rodney wearing?
What was he wearing?
You heard me.
What damn difference does that make?
That was a year ago.
No difference,
you being a liar and all.
Say that again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No need for hostilities here.
We're all friends.
Come on, Snake.
Snake!
Go on. Get out of here.
Sorry about that, Mr. Covington.
Why are you apologizing?
Didn't want to give you the idea
this is an unfriendly town, I guess.
I'm Bruce Barkow.
Well, I love a friendly town.
Believe I'm staying.
Good.
That's good.
- This ain't over, boy.
- No, it's not.
Can I ride along with you?
Do I have a choice?
You seem to be looking
for a lot of trouble, Mr. Covington.
Not particularly.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that fella you braced
back there in town?
Snake Corville.
And?
And I ain't never seen nobody
brace him and walk away from it.
Charles Rodney wasn't killed
by a Sioux raiding party.
If the Indians didn't kill him,
Mr. Covington...
...how did he die?
Oh, that's how.
Whoa...
- Do you speak Sioux?
- How did you know?
It's a gift. Say something friendly.
Easy. Easy. Easy.
It's gonna be all right.
It's all right.
Great heavens!
We better get out of here.
We'll set her leg. It's broke.
That ain't no run-of-the-mill
Indian girl.
That mark means she's the
chief's daughter and we better go.
Cut some splints, Joe.
They catch us with her, they'll
skin us and make jerky out of us...
...and hang us on
the nearest sycamore.
Easy.
Well, thank you kindly.
You rounded up our missing stray.
Rope her, brother Luke.
Excuse me.
Get your own damn squaw.
We cut her out for ourselves.
You want to take her...
...you're welcome to try.
But he'll have a tough time pulling on
that hog leg while it's still lashed.
Luke...
...is my Colt lashed down?
Yep.
You still can't take down
the three of us.
Maybe not.
Maybe so.
Enjoy my squaw, mister.
We'll meet again.
Well, you might turn
out to be useful.
Are you this way always?
If you are, I want to end
this association.
And why is that?
Well, hell, look at you.
First day in the valley,
you rile every hard case in Wyoming.
To say nothing
about that war party over there.
Well, it's a gift.
It's a wonder to me you lived
much past 10 years old.
Squaw-napping. Now...
...that's about as bad a thing
as you can do.
And that old man in the lead...
...that's Red Cloud.
And it looks to me...
...like he's got
a pretty good grouch on.
What the hell is the right word
for leg?
Tell him we're friends
of Charles Rodney.
Rodney's dead.
I promised him
I'd keep his property safe.
He said since you
helped his daughter...
...and you're
Charles Rodney's friend...
...you may go.
Much obliged.
Let's just ease on out of here.
That true what you said
about looking after Charlie's ranch?
It is.
Well, hell. That's the best news
I've heard in a year.
Easy.
How did you know he was
just gonna do that?
It's a gift.
Guess today wasn't my day to die.
Well, hell...
...the day ain't over yet.
For you, Ann.
You know I can't accept it.
Of course you can.
Nothing's too good for my fiancée.
I wish you wouldn't use that word.
I would love to replace it
with "wife."
Ann, I'm a patient man,
but my heart's in a hurry.
Charlie's gone, Ann.
He was a good man and he loved you...
...but that's the past.
And you're my future?
If it pleases you.
Excuse me, Mr. Barkow...
I told you not to disturb me.
They had a run-in with Covington too.
- He took our property.
I don't want to hear it or
know about it. Just take care of it.
Sorry, Ann.
Bruce...
...I can't pay the mortgage again
this month.
There just aren't enough
schoolchildren.
Ann, there will be.
Some day...
...this little town
is going to be a magnificent city.
And I'm going to run it.
And I want you there by my side.
I thought Charlie had
valuable property in San Francisco.
So did I.
I loaned him that
money in good faith.
Foreclosure wouldn't be right.
Maybe I should just let the ranch go.
Do you know a man
named Rafe Covington?
Yes.
Yes, I met him today.
He said Charlie sent him.
IKind of a hell of a mess around here,
but it used to be neat and tidy.
Look here.
This kid's killed this critter twice.
You want it rare,
there's a bunch of them outside.
Why don't you go take a bite of one?
- Mind your elders, boy.
You know, I've been around this place
a long time.
I was here till Barkow
moved Mrs. Rodney to town...
...and then he run me off.
Why does she listen to him?
She's alone, she's scared.
He's got manners and smells nice.
Besides that, he wants this ranch
and he wants it something fierce.
Why does he want this place?
I don't know.
- Maybe he wants Mrs. Rodney fierce.
- Maybe.
Maybe both.
Is it Christmas yet?
You don't look rich.
Maybe rich stopped mattering.
Maybe Charlie mattered more.
Maybe this gourmet cooking
appealed to me.
Brendan Mullaney.
"Rock" to me mates.
- Joe Gill.
- Pleased to meet you, Joe.
Welcome here to Crazy Woman Ranch.
Come on, my boys.
Come on, boys.
Look at them go!
Stay with him!
Oh, boy.
Better slow down, young fella.
What difference does it make?
Well...
...see, if you take your time...
...you get a more harmonious outcome.
Here, let me show you something.
All you need to do, and you don't
need to kill yourself doing it...
...is take a couple of licks
this way...
...a couple that way...
...across the heel.
Pretty much got it.
I'm gonna pick up those supplies.
I should do that, Rafe.
No. I'll go.
He'll go.
You're full of surprises,
Mr. Covington.
Mrs. Rodney.
- Here...
- No, I'll get it.
Spend a lot of time in church?
Well, it's a good place to think.
Care to tell me
what you're thinking about?
Ma'am?
Excuse me.
Your husband wasn't killed
a year ago.
- No.
- No, ma'am.
He died in my arms six weeks ago.
Morning, Mr. Covington.
Mr. Barkow.
Ann...
...ready for our ride?
Have I interrupted something?
No, Bruce.
Mr. Covington was just leaving.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be at the ranch.
What ranch would that be?
Rodney place.
You're letting him
stay at your ranch?
Certainly not.
Then he's trespassing.
We'll get Sheriff Moncrieff.
Bruce...
...he said that Charlie died six
weeks ago. Why would he say that?
He wants something from you.
With a ranch like yours...
...most men would shake hands
with the devil. Come on.
Come on, girl.
Come on!
That won't wash off in the rain.
Let him up boys, let him up.
Go on, little fella.
Ain't it a beautiful part
of the world, Mr. Covington?
I'm glad you're here.
And for me...
...hell, it's good to be home.
You bet.
Old Hennesey's dying
of the tuberculosis...
...so his missis sends for the priest
to give him the last rites.
The priest arrives
at the deathbed and says:
"Hennesey, do you renounce Satan?"
"No," says Hennesey, "I do not."
"You do not?" says the priest.
"No," says Hennesey.
"A man in my condition can't afford
to make any enemies."
Well, we've made a few.
Won't be long they'll be trying
to run us out of here.
If I couldn't hear you breathing...
...I would have thought
that you had expired.
This waiting is
affecting my strategy.
Well, I hope that strategy
don't include plans for that queen...
...because she's gone.
No more Irish jokes.
No, I like them.
There are two bulls
at the top of a hill...
...in Cornamona.
The young bull says
to the old bull...
Would it help
to give back your queen?
That's a boy.
Mrs. Rodney.
Hello, Joe.
Seeing you here
brings back good memories.
For me, as well.
I thought the place
would have been more rundown.
It was.
Howdy, ma'am.
John Thomas Langston.
Mr. Langston.
Nice to see you.
Rock Mullaney.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Will you excuse us, gentlemen?
Go on, pup.
Cut a trail. Go on.
Mr. Covington...
...when my husband died,
I turned my back on this ranch...
...and haven't set foot since.
It wasn't easy for me to come out.
I appreciate that.
But what you said disturbed me.
Who are you?
And why are you doing this?
Mrs. Rodney...
...your late husband was my friend.
I'm keeping half my promise to him.
What do you mean by "half"?
I gave Charlie my word...
...l'd look after this place...
And you.
My husband...
...asked you to look after me?
Yes, ma'am.
My husband never mentioned you to me,
Mr. Covington.
I don't believe you.
I can't.
Oh, well.
I met Charlie in San Francisco.
My father was stationed there
in the Navy.
Charlie was a businessman.
Real estate and shipping.
This was his dream.
I came along because I loved him.
It was gonna be such an adventure.
And our daughter died at 4 months.
Cholera.
And then Charlie...
It tamed me right down.
I shouldn't have come out here.
- I don't belong here.
- Don't you?
No.
Charlie loved this ranch.
He talked about it all the time.
But I believe what he loved most...
...was you.
Enjoy your stay here, Mr. Covington.
It'll be short.
- Afternoon, gentlemen.
- Peewee.
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey with a whiskey chaser.
Yours is on the house, Mr. Covington.
Two bits apiece for the rest.
Why is his on the house?
I always stand a man his last round.
- We just got here, lad.
Taggart says he'll kill him
next time he sees him.
Figured that.
If Taggart comes in...
...might want to buy him a drink.
Another wee dram.
You got a problem where I hang my hat,
don't send a woman with the message.
I won't.
Any message you get from me
will be crystal clear.
Stay away from Ann Rodney.
Whoa, slow down there.
Take your time.
You'll get a more harmonious outcome.
God invented the whiskey to keep
the Irish from ruling the world.
You're very persistent.
Mrs. Rodney, hear me out.
Then if you want me to, I'll go.
I met your husband on a freighter
out of San Francisco.
I was working down the Coast.
He was shanghaied.
He told me he sold off
his holdings in San Francisco...
...to pay off the mortgage
on your ranch.
So he celebrated, got drunk, got
robbed and ended up aboard our ship...
When he tried to escape,
the captain beat him to death.
That was six weeks ago.
Do you have any proof of this?
Just my word.
Pardon the intrusion, ma'am.
Mr. Covington?
Just let me think.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mike Taggart's calling you out.
Covington!
I want you.
And my gun ain't lashed down now.
Mr. Thompson...
...did Charles Rodney order that '76?
Yes, sir. He did.
How's my credit?
Covington!
Come on.
Where you going, Covington?
I'm gonna blow you
out of them fancy boots.
Now calm down, Taggart, and you'll
get a more harmonious outcome.
Besides, you really
ought to thank me.
Thank you? For what?
The fact that
you're wearing your hair.
That was Red Cloud's daughter
you poached.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Then we've got no quarrel, have we?
- Bastard killed my brother.
- He'll do the same to you.
Go to IKansas...
...find Bo Dorn.
Bring him back.
Bo Dorn don't like being brought.
He likes being paid.
That was some shooting!
Wasn't shooting.
That was killing.
Thank you, Lee.
It's overcooked, stupid.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Barkow.
- Cook it again.
Cook it again! Now.
Well, why did Taggart
confront Mr. Covington?
It's not delicate.
Neither am I.
Shortly after he arrived...
...Rafe Covington
attempted to rape a squaw.
Taggart caught him and freed
the squaw, but Covington got away.
And naturally, being a man
of impeccable character...
...Taggart felt it necessary...
...to avenge the squaw's honor?
Something like that.
Thank you, Peewee.
- It looks marvelous.
- Special for you, Miss Ann.
Bruce...
...he said Charlie
died aboard a ship.
He sold his San Francisco holdings
to pay off the mortgage on the ranch.
But he was robbed and shanghaied.
Perhaps he wants to acquire
a lovely ranch...
...and the lovely lady
that goes with it.
- Isn't that what you want?
- Ann...
...I love you.
There were no holdings.
No one was shanghaied.
Charlie died on the trail home.
The prime requisite of charlatans
is their ability to fake sincerity.
One, two, three, lads!
Go on up there.
You're a dirty beast.
Maybe the dumb bastard thought it was
water and wanted to have a bath.
This isn't the only
fine creature here...
...that should be wanting a bath.
You can say that again.
Come on, mate. That's it.
That's the boy.
That's the boy. Now we have it.
Let him go, Joe. Let him go.
There you go. Go on, boy.
What in the hell is that stuff?
The boys here...
...are covered in petroleum.
What's "tapoleum"?
It's oil.
You make kerosene out of it and
asphalt for paving the streets.
Is it worth anything?
Worth more than enough
to pay off a mortgage.
Howdy, gents.
Hello, Walter.
Sheriff...
...you're sitting
in my rocking chair.
I thought that's what it was for.
It's for people I
invite to sit in it.
Walter, you ain't invited.
I want your version
of them shootings.
Self-defense.
- That's it?
- Yes, sir.
Well, there's some folks around here
says different.
They're not being truthful.
You son of a bitch.
I'm sorry about your brother, but I
gave him every chance to walk away.
- Are you going to arrest him or not?
- Not today, Luke.
Well, what else you come for?
You are trespassing illegally
on this property.
You can leave freely...
...or in irons.
It's your choice.
Ann Rodney owns this spread.
I'll get off it when she says.
Well, I'm the mortgage holder...
...and I'm telling you,
you have three days to clear out.
It appears you already got
that mortgage money, Barkow.
Prove it.
Believe I will.
Sheriff Moncrieff.
There is a rather large...
...outstanding balance on this,
Mr. Covington.
Three days, Mr. Covington.
Did you put flowers
on Taralee's grave?
No.
He did.
Have I not devoted myself to
protecting you and your interests?
Yes.
Been at your beck and call?
Yes.
Come over
in the middle of the night...
...to chase away
nightmares and spiders?
It was a very big spider.
Could have put a saddle on it.
In three days...
...if Rafe Covington has
not vacated Crazy Woman...
...I will kick him off.
By whatever means necessary.
One question, Bruce.
Is the ranch still mine?
Of course.
Then I'll decide
who's welcome to stay.
Why you shoot that old Evans, Joe?
Well, it's got 28 bullets...
...and I ain't a very good shot.
I'm going to town.
Nellie.
Apparently right and wrong
mean nothing to you.
Mr. Gill...
...once Covington leaves the ranch...
...you're welcome to stay on.
No, sir.
Your talk is as cheap as your liquor.
What'll it be?
I got whiskey, whiskey and...
That'll be one dollar.
Sir?
One time he killed three fellas,
cut their heads off.
Hung them above the pawnshop,
right by a sign that said:
"Money to loan."
Then he's having supper
with a guy one time...
...chased him down the end
of main street...
...killed him, skinned him,
nailed his hide to the barn door.
He's tougher than the back wall of a
shooting gallery. And that, boys...
...is Bo Dorn.
Sounds like one scary fella.
Does, doesn't he?
Maybe he's passing through.
Nope. He don't leave IKansas unless
he's on his way to kill somebody.
I'm betting that somebody
is you, boss.
No bet.
So you're gonna go to town
and face this Bo Dorn fella...
...just to keep a promise to Charlie.
Come on now, Joe. There's more
to this than real estate.
What are you laughing at?
I'm just reading the signs, Rafe.
And the tracks is fresh.
About 115 pounds.
Answers to the name of "Ann."
She plays a nice piano.
...had entrenched
And care sat on his faded cheeks
But under brows of dauntless courage
And considerate pride waiting revenge
Cruel his eye...
...but cast signs of remorse
and passion to behold..."
"I feel a link of nature draw me; flesh
of flesh, bone of my bone thou art
And from thy state of mind shall
never be parted in bliss or woe."
I always liked poetry,
never could understand it.
Really?
I was hoping you could help.
Well, seeing as though
it's such a beautiful day...
...why don't we all go play outside?
The last time I saw you...
...you were busy killing men.
And all to honor your word
to my dead husband.
You were part of the promise.
Yes, I was.
Rafe.
What sort of a name is that?
Short for Raphael.
The Archangel.
Sent by Providence
to guide and to guard...
...to heal and to save.
That Raphael?
My mother was a God-fearing woman.
And she taught you
Beethoven and Milton.
After a fashion.
She sent me to the Jesuits.
To be a priest?
Yes, ma'am.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Tell me, how does a man
go from the Jesuits to...
Couldn't get the knack
of turning the other cheek.
Every time you finish talking
you get on your horse and ride away.
Why is that?
Well, that's
an interesting question...
...considering you've tried to get
rid of me ever since I hit town.
Well, maybe I've changed my mind.
That would be nice.
I don't want to lose my ranch.
You won't.
I appreciate your respect for my
husband's memory, Mr. Covington.
And your promise to him.
It's a promise I'm planning to keep.
Afternoon, Mr. Dorn.
Would you mind stepping outside
to smoke that?
I can't abide the devil weed.
I'll be out here.
Let's get down to business, Barkow.
That 500 I already sent you...
...that's just a down payment.
There will be 500 more
once Covington's gone.
For that amount of money,
I wouldn't waste time nor lead.
So how much do you want?
I've been looking to relocate.
IKansas is a tad too civilized
to suit me. Now, the Rodney spread...
...it might suit me just right.
- I've been working on it over a year.
- Scheming and tripping over your spurs?
You should have let me
just shoot Charlie and be done...
...but that was too easy.
"Let the sea take him."
That suited your fine hand
a bit better.
It was a good plan.
I just didn't figure on Covington.
What kind of dinosaur upends his whole
life to keep a promise to a dead man?
Well, it don't matter.
You want that dinosaur extinct, we're
equal partners. Take it or leave it.
It ain't all that bad.
I could kill you and keep the bitch
and her patch of dirt all to myself.
Good evening, Ann.
It's late for a visit.
Just in time, actually.
The white satin dress, I think.
The one I bought you.
What about it?
I'd like you to wear it tomorrow.
To our wedding.
Did I miss something,
or did another Ann agree to that?
You want me on bended knee, Ann?
Okay. Here I am.
Marry me, Ann.
Bruce, please get up.
What's come over you?
Love.
And love demands an answer.
I'm not ready.
You better damn well...
...get ready.
Or what?
Or...
Just do as I say.
You know, I was
run off this place once.
No more.
I'm staying.
I'm with you, Rafe.
If it wasn't for Charlie on that boat,
I would have thrown myself overboard.
He kept fighting...
...no matter what.
He never gave up.
Neither will I.
My whole life I've never had roots
deeper than topsoil.
I believe I'm staying.
What are you gonna do?
Take him down? Flush him out?
Either way, your problem's solved.
Breakfast, Ann?
That would be lovely, Gene.
Push the rest of the strays
into the west canyon...
...no later than noon.
You won't like it there.
You boys won't make much fun of these
when I serve them up.
All right, find your mom.
Go on.
Don't look like much...
...but it's damn near priceless.
That's oil, ma'am.
Is this what Bruce is after?
One of the things.
And what are you after?
One of the things.
Are you after the oil?
No, ma'am.
Head for home, boys.
That's a boys.
Bruce has hired a killer.
A man named Bo Dorn.
He had to hire somebody.
- You know Dorn?
- IKnow of.
- Can he...?
- IKill me?
Yes.
Do you care?
You know I do.
Well, maybe you should say it.
Well, maybe I should show it.
Can he?
Nobody ever has.
Go.
Please.
Aw, kid.
No!
It's starting.
What's starting, Ann?
- Trouble.
- You're wrong, darling.
Trouble isn't starting. It's ending.
I thought I told you
to put on that satin dress.
I know the truth...
...and I believe Rafe.
Well, I'm not exactly
dressed to the nines myself.
Guess it'll be come-as-you-are.
Shall we?
- Shall we what?
- Walk arm in arm down the aisle.
You've lost your mind.
There's no way...
Bruce, please.
Did you say something?
Gene!
Let me go!
Somebody help me!
What in the world?
Gather the dearly beloved together,
your honor.
We're getting married.
I'll never marry you!
Sheriff.
You gents remove your hats.
If anybody here
objects to this union...
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.
I object.
Barkow...
...you're the big man in this town,
but this ain't right.
Let her go.
Yes, let her go.
Bruce, don't you think you...
Peewee, get back behind the bar
where you belong.
I said let her go.
My, oh, my.
You're so brave today, but so...
...badly misguided.
Proceed, Your Honor.
Do you, Bruce Barkow...
...take Ann Rodney
to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Do you, Ann Rodney, take Bruce Barkow
to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do n...
Yes, she does.
By the power vested in me...
...by the territorial authority
of Wyoming...
...I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Not my finest hour.
- We can't let this continue.
- Not a lot we can do.
Oh, yes there is.
We can stop being afraid.
He'll kill us, Melissa.
We'll continue this later...
...when you've calmed down a touch.
May the road rise to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the warm sun
shine on your face...
...and a soft rain
fall on your fields.
And until we meet again, may God
hold you in the palm of His hand.
And may you be three days in heaven
before the Devil knows you're dead.
Amen.
How many, you figure?
Only three.
Where are you going?
Just be ready.
- How do you know he'll be there?
- That's where I'd be.
I'm not a very good rifle shot,
you know.
Oh, hell.
In here.
The undertaker is in.
Hold on, Joe!
It's a first for me, Joe.
What's that?
I've never had to fight my way
into a saloon before.
How many?
Five! -There's something
I need to tell you.
Mrs. Rodney might be in there.
Barkow, he sort of forced her
to marry him yesterday.
What?
They got married.
I heard you!
Barkow!
Still hiding behind that woman?
That's my wife you're talking about!
Send her out!
You come and get her!
Hello, Walter.
Oh, what the hell.
We're low on cartridges.
Melissa, thank God.
Come on, we have to be careful.
Joe!
You shot me.
Just when things
were going so well for you.
And...
...may the best man win.
No, no, the other arm.
My hat. My hat.
I did something, Melissa.
Yes, Gene, you did.
