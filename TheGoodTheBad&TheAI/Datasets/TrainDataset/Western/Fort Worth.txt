Get dirt
in that new press,
and I'll whale the black
juice out of you.
I'll put the cover
right back on it, Mr. Garvin.
Just as soon as I finish
this special edition.
Well, see that
you do.
Better proofread his copy.
We got lady readers.
Looks like
we got company.
Whoever would
that be?
Somebody with
a taste for solitude.
Texas Trail
makes lonely riding
for a man alone.
Great godfrey,
a woman.
You never see one before?
Sure, but not out here
in the middle of nowhere.
What can I do
for you, ma'am ?
I heard there were
wagons southbound.
Been ridin' to catch up.
Any objections
if I join your train?
No, help yourself.
Afternoon.
Where are
you headin'?
Texas.
It's a big state.
San Antonio.
Where are you going?
I'm for Fort Worth.
We can travel together
for a piece.
Good idea.
Pretty dangerous
for a woman alone.
My idea exactly.
A woman needs a man
to look after her.
Don't you worry,
lady.
You'll be safe
with me and Mr. Britt.
Britt?
Hey, Mr. Britt!
Let's go!
All right, Toby,
alley-oop.
Aah.
Attaboy.
Toby's ma died
in Dakota.
His pa was killed by Injuns
before Toby was born.
It won't do him
no harm
knowing a man
like Ned Britt.
No harm at all, ma'am.
They have a good deal in common.
You know Mr. Britt?
He rode into Texas
20 years ago, alone.
His only friend was a gun.
But it fed him and kept him
alive in many other ways.
Ned Britt?
Why, he claims firearms
is just for heathens
that can't read.
He's joshing you,
ma'am.
I saw him when
he rode out of Texas...
a one-man arsenal,
off to join
the Southern cavalry.
TOBY:
Yippee!
Lookie,
Mr. Britt.
And what's that?
Cattle on the drive
for Dodge City.
You'll wanna
remember
your first
cattle drive, son.
Be something for you
to tell your children.
Bellies full of
good Texas grass,
they're heading north
to the railroads.
By the time
you're grown,
iron rails will be
crisscrossing these prairies,
and the cattle
will be riding to market
instead of having all
the good meat run off of 'em.
Be more efficient, but
nowhere near as pretty.
We're gettin' close
to Buffalo Wells.
The cattle
smell it.
Well, let 'em drink.
We'll bed down here.
Hey, Gabe.
Yeah?
Trouble's brewin'.
Know who's on his way
to Texas?
I don't know
and I don't care.
You will.
He's camped yonder.
Ned Britt.
Ned Britt?
Ain't he satisfied he made
Abilene and Dodge City
unfit for
human habitation?
What's he goin'
to Texas for?
I'm just
a north-riding stranger.
Who is this Britt?
He sets up
a newspaper in Texas.
You'll read
about all
the brand blocki''
you've pulled.
Just a type slinger.
Him and Ben Garvin own
a couple of papers in Kansas.
I hear they figure to get
a whole string of 'em
clean across
the Southwest.
They make too free
namin' names.
Names like...
Gabe Clevenger?
I won't have him
in Texas.
Now, who's gonna
stop him?
Don't tell me
you jaspers are scared
of some
quill pusher.
No, not
scared.
Just gettin' along
kind of comfortable.
Why, you big
brave bunnies.
I'll show you
how to han--
Shut up, you big wind,
and put that gun away.
Now don't tell me
that you're scared
of your own shadow.
Afeard to throw lead
at some ink dauber.
He throws lead,
jughead, type.
And it's got
aplenty scatter to it.
You drill one of them
newspaper fellows,
and what have you got?
A dozen more ready to step in
and blast the print at you.
Ha, ha.
That don't scare me.
GABE:
You and that
hot trigger of yours.
We got a jumpy herd
on our hands here,
and I ain't a-payin' you
to stampede 'em with gunfire.
Did I hear you send
for me, Gabe?
I didn't send for--
Yeah.
Whoa.
There you are,
boy.
Stay and eat,
Mr. Britt.
Thank you, ma'am,
but, uh--
I'd be pleased to.
TOBY:
Lady, I want you to meet
my friend, Mr. Britt.
Howdy, ma'am.
Hiya, High Pockets.
Stop skittering.
I've called you that
often enough,
though I had more
freckles when you--
Flora?
Flora Talbot.
About time
you came home, Ned.
Were you the one
riding south?
Heading back from Dodge City.
Alone?
Have you forgotten when you
used to ride herd for Dad?
Cowhands still like
to go on a weeks' toot
when they hit
Abilene or Dodge.
I left 'em there.
Must be some pretty strong
attraction back in Fort Worth.
There is.
He's a lucky man.
You be sure to tell him so.
He'll be awful glad
to see you, Ned.
Blair.
Of course.
Might have known.
I hear he pretty near
is Fort Worth now.
I've been hearing some
pretty bad stories about you.
It figures.
Ned Britt,
a respectable newspaperman.
Blair will die laughing.
Your father wouldn't.
No, he'd have been
proud of you, Ned.
Just as I am.
He did better
raising you
than he did me.
He'd have been
pretty proud of you too,
if he could
see you.
It's a still
night. Hot.
Cattle will get restless.
Don't you worry.
That Caster will
get the job done
quiet as a breeze.
Quiet, everybody.
Quiet.
Special edition.
"On Monday,
April the 1st,
"the wagon train was attacked
by hordes of Indians.
"Only the trusty gun of
Toby Nickerson
"saved the immigrants
from destruction.
"Scores of redskins
bit the dust.
"And when the smoke
cleared,
"young Nickerson was seen
to be in complete command
of the situation."
Bang. Bang.
You wrote that.
A boy ought to
have something
to show
his grandchildren.
"Miss Flora Talbot,
"now returning home
after driving her own herd
"to market in Dodge City,
"joined the wagon
train today.
"To all our young buckoes,
let it be known
"she will
shortly wed
"Mr. Blair Lunsford
of Fort Worth.
He is the crack shot
of Tarrant County."
Blair would be
dancing in the streets
if he knew he was
gonna see you.
Hm. It's been
a lot of years.
Be worth turning off the trail
for a sight of him.
Why don't you?
Why don't you start
your paper in Fort Worth?
It's your home.
So was Abilene
and Dodge City.
So will San Antonio be.
Newspaper's gotta start
where there's readers.
You know what I mean.
Why haven't you
ever come home?
I...kind of forgot that.
Was it because of Amy Brooks?
Maybe in the beginning.
Whatever happened to her?
MAN:
Where are you, Britt?!
That's that rider's guide.
How'd he get in there?
That you?
I don't wanna make
any mistake about it.
I heard Clevenger's
camped next door.
I suppose you're
one of his hands.
My name's Jack Harvey.
Happy Jack Harvey.
Now put that name
in your public prints.
Happy Jack don't do
no pot shootin'.
I'm giving you notice
to get yourself a gun.
Boy, you're right
out of a dime novel.
So go back and tell Clevenger
you scared me.
Go join a Wild West show,
anything.
But stop bothering
these people here.
You don't care they see you
afraid to fight?
Not a whoop.
Let it go at that.
Yellow-belly!
But that won't
save your hide.
Don't fire that gun!
Don't, you fool!
It'll stampede the cattle!
Ride for the herd!
Hyah!
Clevenger.
One of his killers.
BRITT:
Stampede.
Stay off the prairie.
Your wagons
are your only cover.
Get to them,
under or in them.
Luther, guard that press
with your mortal body!
WOMAN:
Let's get out of here!
Mr. Britt, Mr. Britt!
Toby, come here!
Here!
Get back, Toby.
Toby, get under.
Get under!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Toby.
Mrs. Nickerson...
you'll have to
go on alone.
They killed Toby.
What are you gonna
do about it?
Destroy them.
With words?
If you wanna
call it that.
I'm glad my father
can't hear you now.
He shot men just for
topping his herds.
And so did you,
Ned Britt.
I've learned better.
You. The man
I used to worship.
You and Blair,
because together
you could whip
all Tarrant County.
Sure, I could step out there
and kill Clevenger men,
and get killed
doing it.
You afraid
of getting killed?
What have they
done to you, Ned?
Why don't you
grow up?
I've seen killings,
death by wholesale,
but I found something
in the blood and dirt of it.
A little Southern
newspaper
that kept pounding away
at the truth,
about the lost cause and
the lives we're paying for it.
That's sane
truth.
It took courage
in those crazy days.
It was a hated
truth.
But it shaped opinion
that taught me.
That the presses are
a thousand times more potent
than gunpowder.
I doubt if
Blair will...
quite know you.
Well, I'll
be danged.
People coming in
instead of moving out.
Fort Worth.
Ha!
Cough real hard, and you'd
blow the place down.
We had big dreams here,
till the panic hit us.
Somebody ought to
welcome 'em.
That's you, sheriff.
They look old enough
to vote.
Hi, there.
It's Flora Talbot.
You bring settlers
with you, Florie?
They swung off the trail
to bring me.
Blair...
You loon.
Getting loonier
every day.
Figured maybe you jumped
the fence with some jayhawk.
No, but I brought one
with me.
It can't be!
But it is!
Ned Britt,
that prodigal son of mine.
Fourteen years ain't done you
a bit of good, boy.
Hey, Flora, you told me
he was good-looking.
Well, this boy is
an awful sight.
Oh, I'm prettier
than you.
I guess they don't carry 'em
up around Kansas.
Oh, I was
spruce enough
till Clevenger's
bunch mussed me.
One of them tried
some shooting.
They were after Ned.
Stampeded
the herd, and...
And a boy
was killed.
Something, at last,
to hang Clevenger.
Yes, sir,
Mr. Lunsford, but--
You arrest him when
he returns, hear me?
Ned will bear witness.
There were
others there too.
This is Mr. Garvin,
Ned's partner.
Glad to
know you.
And Luther
Wickes.
I'll make
a deposition.
There you go.
Everything's gonna be
all right with Ned here.
We're not staying in
Fort Worth, Blair.
What tune
are you singing?
Ben and I need a town
with enough subscribers
to support a paper.
But this is
your town, Ned.
Flora, bring his partner along.
We'll show 'em.
Come along,
Mr. Garvin.
Luther, you stay here
and guard that press.
You ought to let us know
you were coming.
We'd have had brass bands
and parties galore.
I have
no ties here.
Old man Brooks
went into bankruptcy
like most of the people
in the town.
Only he didn't live
to suffer from it.
And his daughter, Amy?
She moved to
greener pastures.
You never heard
from her, Ned?
Once.
She returned
our engagement ring.
I got it at
the Battle of Five Forks
just before
Richmond fell.
Forget her, Ned.
I have.
Here you are, gents.
Drink up.
Ned...
there's the world:
Texas.
You own Texas,
and you can buy the rest.
And here...
right here,
is where all its treasures
are gonna crisscross,
going east and west,
and north and south: Fort Worth.
Gents, you are standing on
the hub of the nation right now.
Uh-- Your axle's
busted.
Well, you're
dead right.
Mice are starving
in this town.
My creditors look like
an army roll call.
But I'm giving it
to you dark, boys.
You see, Mr. Garvin,
I don't want anybody
who's looking for
a ready-made paradise.
I know Ned's
courage.
I envied him out there,
fighting the battles.
You did your part.
We'd have starved
without you and your kind.
Let's be level, Ned.
They paid for my beef.
Oh, I put my head
on a block right enough...
running the gulf
and through the lines.
But when the war ended,
I had a small fortune.
That came
without asking.
Well, I didn't think much
about it until it was all over.
And then I saw
what I could do.
Bring the railroad in
and make this the richest
county in the state.
Unfortunately, the railway
company wasn't impressed.
"What have you got to
freight?" they said.
And Blair said, "Cattle.
We'll build a packing plant
and ship it all the way
from Fort Worth."
That's a great
idea.
Is it, Ned?
Every cent I own
is sunk in it.
An empty packing plant
big enough for Kansas City
right out there
on the outskirts of town.
Panic stopped
the railroad from coming in.
Why not haul to Dallas,
ship from there?
That's the remark
of a foreigner, Mr. Garvin.
Even if Dallas
wasn't cotton and industry,
we still wouldn't make 'em
a gift of our cattle business.
Oh, we'll do
all right,
once we break
Clevenger's terrorizing.
He knows he'll have
no trail-driving contracts
once we get rails.
He keeps the panic going,
but we'll beat him.
Ned pulling double with me...
we can beat
a dozen Clevengers.
And with
your paper,
put some fat on the bones
of this town.
Enough to guarantee
the freight
to bring the railroad
to us.
We'll make our noise
heard across the state.
We'll get us
our own governor in Austin.
You, Mr. Lunsford?
BLAIR:
Why not?
But I'll need
your paper.
And I'll need
your guns, Ned.
The whole suffering
county needs 'em.
Don't look, Blair.
He never wears them.
What?
What have they done
to you, Ned?
Flora will tell you.
Come on, Ben.
Yes,
go on.
Go as far south and west
as you like, Ned.
And I hope you hear
the beating
of the hoofs of cattle
in your sleep.
I'd just as leave
set up shop here
if I didn't have
a partner.
GARVIN:
Me.
And a penny newspaper.
Sounds cheap, don't it?
But a penny newspaper
can make or break
the millionaire's
dollar power on Earth,
turn the beam
on them that shine,
drive the vermin
to their holes.
Why, I can bring
good people to this town
like moths drawn
to the light.
That's kind of
high-flown, Ben.
Mind if I put it
simpler?
No. Go ahead.
We're going to
delouse this burg.
Oh, Ned.
BLAIR:
You can pour me a drink
on that, Mr. Garvin.
And you wasn't
gonna let Britt
set up shop in Texas.
Their office
is up the street.
We'll clean
it out.
And have the papers
in Dodge City and Abilene
a-screamin' their lungs out
about it?
Man, you'd have the federal
agents a-sniffin' at us.
I tell ya, boys, just keep
a-workin' on this town,
it won't support
no newspaper.
Them that's smart enough to read
will get wise enough to move.
Come on.
Fingers
getting itchy?
No, but I bet
Blair's are.
Ha. I doubt it.
He ain't ready
to tangle with Clevenger.
Just a reporter's tip.
Sheriff's got
his chance now.
I got to go post them
sheriff's sales notice.
I better help you.
Come back here,
you no-good--
I said, come back here!
CLEVENGER:
Sheriff!
You allow filthy trash
like that to be circulated?
W-- W-- The license
for printing
ain't my orbit, Gabe.
Well, maybe
you're right.
And maybe it's
a civil court affair,
suing them scoundrels
for libel.
But I don't like
to go to court.
Well, I don't reckon
you do, Gabe.
I don't reckon anybody does.
B-but this here warrant says
you're sure going to court.
What warrant?
Mr. Britt signed
murder charges against you.
Well, now, don't
get mad at me, Gabe.
I ain't sitting
in judgment.
You just arrestin' me, huh?
That's all.
You'll excuse me,
sheriff,
for talking so harsh
to you, won't you?
No hard feelings.
Shake.
Hey.
ALL:
Hyah!
MAN:
Oh, look at him!
A town that can't
support its law
don't deserve a paper.
What did you mean about Blair
not being ready?
Nothing, Ned.
Nothing yet,
leastways.
News comes
in pieces, boys,
like a suit
of clothes.
Don't ever sport
the jacket
unless you're sure you got
the britches on.
Ah.
But did you know he's buying up
Tarrant County property?
Well, what's
wrong with that?
Shows good
civic faith.
He couldn't.
He's broke.
So am I.
But I can always
snag two bits
for coffee and beans.
Just like Blair
can borrow
the big stuff
to buy up options.
Uh, by the way...
you accidentally
have two bits?
You'll give away the whole
newspaper sometime
to a bunch of birds
with hard-luck stories.
You coming to supper?
Eat later.
Got some work to do.
Here's your editorial.
Read it.
"Aside from Gabe Clevenger's
lawless activities,
"the civic corpse
of Fort Worth
"shows no sign of life
whatsoever.
"We can personally vouch
for the fact that yesterday,
"a panther was seen
sleeping at midday
"in the center
of Belknap Street,
unmolested by any of
our brave citizens."
Pretty good.
Mr. Garvin would want
to know the age and sex
of the panther.
No interest, except
to another panther.
Come on.
Let's go to press.
Now, you only have to
gun Britt,
and the old one will dry up
and blow away by hisself.
Well, Britt's
in there. I seen him.
Good. Now, Mort will
plug him from the alley.
But take no chance
on him gettin' out.
When you hear
Mort shoot,
you move in the front.
Where are you
going?
To church,
if I can find one.
'Cause I want
to be someplace
where I don't know
a thing about this.
Outside papers
will start digging.
And them newsies
stick together
like sorghum.
Fix yourself a libation,
Mr. Garvin.
That's real Kentucky.
Uh, it's still
working hours for me.
An interview?
Sort of.
Why do you want this town
on the rocks, Mr. Lunsford?
Me?
You've been puffing
locoweed.
The Lewis ranch,
this section here,
6,000 acres over there,
and right here in town--
this and this and this
--and this
whole block here...
all under option
to Blair Lunsford.
I don't suppose
you have any idea
where I could raise the money
to pick up those options.
Not yet.
No, I didn't think so.
But only a fool
would buy 'em
unless'n he thought
Fort Worth had a future.
You're no fool.
Thanks.
Other hand...
anyone owned as much
of the county as you do
wouldn't let Gabe
Clevenger terrorize it
unless'n it suited
his purposes.
What do you want me to do?
Take the law in my own hands?
We've got a sheriff--
Scared of
his own shadow.
Now you've said
something.
You know what they
call you, Mr. Lunsford?
"Mr. Fort Worth."
Seems to me
Mr. Fort Worth
could get himself
a good
law enforcement officer.
If he wanted one.
All right, mister.
You asked for information.
I'll give it to you.
Sure, I bought up
all the property I could.
I love this town,
Mr. Garvin.
I've got faith in it.
But there are others
who live here besides me.
I've got one vote,
and that's all I want.
I'm one citizen.
Just because I own more
property than the next fellow,
I don't ask
for any more rights
or any more privileges.
What are you
doing here?!
Well, ain't you gonna
ask me in?
I wouldn't ask you
into a hog wallow.
You'd dirty it up.
Uh, you've got no call to take
that attitude toward me.
You neither,
Mr. Garvin.
And don't let him fill
your paper with his spleen.
I appeal to you,
Mr. Lunsford,
to stop pounding me
out of my rightful living.
To stop your unholy
persecutin'.
Heh. Never saw
so many martyrs.
Persecute you?
Mr. Garvin here thinks
I'm in cahoots with you.
Cahoots?
And you're in cahoots
with the devil
to rub salt in my sores.
Why, I count it lucky anymore
to get a herd to drive.
Wicked unfair,
Mr. Lunsford,
to have the bread
taken out of my mouth
before that railroad
even gets here.
I'm not
raising cattle.
No, but
Miss Talbot is.
And if I could get the contract
to take her herds north,
then the rest of them ranchers
might open up their hearts so--
Where'd I put
that shotgun?
Crawl for
the front door.
I've got to find
that shotgun.
Mr. Britt!
Where are you,
Clevenger?!
You said you wanted
some gravy, didn't you?
Well, come a-runnin'
and bring the rest
of your scurvies with you!
Why, you rampaging
old longhorn.
Biggest thing out
since Sam Houston.
You print that, son.
I like the sound of it.
Wait a minute.
Flora invited you
to dinner too.
Tell her
Mr. Garvin regrets.
On account of Blair?
You never liked him
from the first, did you?
Not even after
he saved my life.
He couldn't afford
to let you get killed.
Those pieces you've
been writing on him...
It'd have to be
by George Washington
out of Queen Bess.
The paper's half mine.
That half says what I think.
Stop fitting
the truth
to the shape
of your heart.
You'll be a better
newspaperman.
Oh.
I know it isn't easy.
What with friends
around
who say you're
just hard mean.
You ever wonder why
I never got married?
Boy...
I was foolish
human once.
She was pretty.
Just as pretty
as Flora.
But I printed her old man
right into the pen...
where he belonged.
Ben's a great man,
Luther.
Right.
Going to make him
real mad someday
by telling him so.
Uh, Mr. Britt.
The roomer in 201
wants to subscribe to
the
Thanks, Bob.
Every new one counts.
Amy.
Hello, Ned.
So good to see you.
The years fall away,
and you haven't
changed at all.
I've changed right enough,
but you haven't.
You're even prettier,
if anything.
I wish I could
believe you, Ned.
It's been a long time
since anyone has said...
I've been living in New Orleans,
and I just got back.
I wanted to see you
first of anyone.
How'd you know
I was here?
I read about you
in the
You're big pumpkins
now, Ned.
Your articles get quoted
way over in Louisiana.
Makes me mighty proud
to know you.
Fort Worth will seem
pretty dull to you
after New Orleans.
Not to me.
Most I've seen of it was through
a millinery shop window.
I bet you hold with the idea
a girl shouldn't work.
Mm-mm.
Even knew a woman who
worked on a newspaper once.
She wrote a column
on cooking.
Oh.
I-- I was wondering
how to ask you...
About a job?
No, Ned, I--
I was just hinting
a-about supper.
Walking into a hotel
dining room all by yourself--
I just wouldn't know how.
Suffering catfish,
I forgot all about it.
I'm sorry, Amy, but I'm booked
for supper. Late too.
Here's proof that I'm
not even making excuses.
"Miss Flora Talbot
will entertain
the staff of the at dinner
with Mr. Blair Lunsford."
I'm sorry, Ned.
If I'd known, I wouldn't
have suggested it.
Wait a minute.
There'll be an extra place
at Flora's table.
This will give us
a real chance
to talk about
old times.
Blair and Flora and--
You're sure they'll want me?
They'll be delighted.
Come on. Get ready.
All right.
Give him a drink of water
and tie him up, Lu.
Brought you a little
surprise, Flora.
Amy's sitting in
for Ben.
Why, Amy, I'm delighted.
Same here.
Thanks for
smuggling me in, Ned.
This is all
I wanted you for.
Just a chance
to throw a dead cat
in Blair
Lunsford's lap.
Get her out of here.
Ned wouldn't do that.
Not my old flame...
your friend.
More likely he'd shoot
your head off, Blair,
for cutting his fences
the minute his back
was turned on us.
Flora...
Don't believe her.
She was heading
the wrong direction
long before
she left Fort Worth.
If I was,
it was in your direction.
Tell her, Blair.
Tell Flora how it was me
you were going to marry.
Tell her how Hardy Talbot died,
and you saw all those
dollar marks in her eyes.
Tell her how
you put me
out to pasture
in New Orleans.
Goodbye, Flora.
And thanks again, Ned.
And so long,
Fort Worth.
Thanks for all
the hayrides.
Why did you
bring her here?
Not that
it matters,
but I didn't
know this about Amy.
You're in love
with Flora.
I never said so.
That's why you dug up
that woman.
Believe what you want.
Let it go at that.
You've got a paper
to use against me.
To take Flora,
you will use
every dirty card
in the deck.
I won't use the newspaper
for a personal fight.
Then you'd better
get yourself some guns.
Thanks for the ride.
Okay.
Giddyap.
He's fallen asleep.
No.
Someone ran out
the alley door
just as I came in.
Send out
the word.
There's the knife
killed Ben.
There's the one
aimed at me.
Two peas out of
the same pod.
Both from Clevenger's
killers.
But Gabe ain't been
in town for over a week.
Heh. It don't seem fair
to blame--
Sheriff. Some of
his boys are.
Joe Castro's
with 'em
over by the Chuckaway
Saloon right now.
They done it,
they'll answer for it.
I'll bring 'em in.
I got me a real deputy now.
Come on, Walter.
You didn't
know Ben.
He meant
nothing to you.
You want a deputy,
you got one.
Any objection?
Glad to have you, Mr. Britt.
Right glad to have you.
I can handle it.
I've heard
that song before.
Who is it?
The sheriff, maybe.
Funnier
than that.
Inkpot Britt,
bowleggin'
a pair of guns.
No. Don't
scare him away.
Let him walk into it.
Castro's right.
Nobody can
target a pistol
at that dist--
Did he say nobody?
That bird's
a ringer.
Here's your gun,
sheriff.
I've done your job
for you.
You keep the guns, Ned.
And you keep the badge too.
You done good,
Mr. Britt.
But you didn't
need to.
Suppose I should have
let 'em
ride out of
town again?
Didn't say that.
Didn't mean it, either.
I said I could handle it.
And I aim to.
You remember that libel
you printed
about the panther
asleep in the street?
Well, you made us
all-fired mad.
It's no libel. And
my partner's dead.
But not mad
at you, Britt.
Mad at ourselves--
shameful mad
--for letting Clevenger
and his gang
run the monkey show
around here.
We're calling in
our bunch
the Panther Club,
Mr. Britt.
And it ain't gonna be
no joke to Clevenger.
I didn't know different,
I'd swear I was back
in Fort Worth.
I mean the town
I used to know.
LUTHER:
"Our most eminent citizen
stands in the rays
"of the today.
"Is he a man worthy
of the governorship...
"or another hero
in muddy boots?
"Here are facts for
the people of Fort Worth.
"The terrorism of
Gabe Clevenger's drovers,
"added to
the financial panic,
"has decreased
our population from 5000
"to less than 1000
discouraged souls.
"Blair Lunsford
has capitalized
"on this
discouragement
"by buying
property options
"from sellers reduced
to utter poverty.
"Though he has
shown his faith
"in the future of
Fort Worth,
"he has failed to take any steps
to ensure that future.
"Never, that is,
until April 18th, when,
"having acquired
the last available
"piece of city property,
"he made
his now-famous stand
"against Clevenger's
assassins,
"when they attempted
the life of Ned Britt
at the offices
of the
M-Mis-- Mr. Garvin never
even got to proof it.
Railroad comes in,
and...
Lunsford will
own everything.
Well, he won't
strut so big
when he reads this
in tomorrow's issue.
He won't read it.
We won't
print it.
But we got to print it,
Mr. Britt.
Mr. Garvin wrote it.
He's dead.
I'm running the paper.
Lu...
Yes, sir?
Listen. I'll tell you
what I'm up against.
Why?
Like you say...
Mr. Garvin's dead.
It's your paper.
I have a personal fight
with Lunsford.
I can't use the paper
against him.
It'd be
hitting foul.
Lunsford ever
makes governor...
it'll foul the state.
What do
you want?
Not a thing...
Except to say I'm sorry
about Garvin.
He wouldn't want
your sympathy.
Read it. Your hands
won't make it any dirtier.
Print it.
What?
You've got
no obligations to me.
Print anything you like.
You hog-tied me when you figured
I'd use the press to take Flora.
I wasn't thinking
about her, Ned, or me.
I was thinking
about you and Ben.
About how you'll
sleep better
if you think you've done
what he wanted.
But he was wrong, Ned.
Wrong about me.
This is my town.
And I'm building it.
It'll take more than words.
Who do you think
organized the Panthers?
Who do you think
they'll benefit?
Fort Worth.
I'm burying this...
for now.
So far your sins
against this town
have been sins of omission.
But I find you've
committed just one,
I'll lay it
above you or Flora.
I'll break you
in this state.
So be careful
where your scent leads.
Ben made me enough
of a newspaperman to follow it.
But you don't
have to follow, Ned.
You can ride
right alongside.
This town's going places,
and we're going with it.
We can pull double--
That's out for me!
Not in your dirty harness.
All right then.
That's the way
you feel about it.
But we're not the worst team
in the world.
Where are you going?
Clevenger's got
a droving contract.
He's down at
the stockyards now.
Panthers are
gonna arrest him,
and I've got to
cover the story.
Stay where you are.
You don't cover that story
with a pencil.
GABE:
We get these few head
over the mountains there,
we'll be on our way.
SHERIFF:
Gabe!
Climb down off of
that horse real easy.
You ain't gonna tell me
I'm under arrest again,
are you, sheriff?
And this time
it sticks.
That's why I voted
for you, sheriff.
So as you'd be a big help
to these here ferocious--
What is it they started
calling theirselves?
The Panther Club.
The "Panthiers."
Well, uh, healthy-looking
cat's all right.
Their noses is cold,
and so's their feet.
You think I won't
blow your head off,
try finding it
in the morning.
Haul him out of
that saddle.
Mort Springer too.
The rest of you
we're giving time
to get across
the county line.
I'll shoot
the first man
who tries to
come back.
Don't move, gents.
Stand where
you are.
Drop that rifle,
Walter.
I've got a bead
on your back.
And you,
Lunsford,
got a lead pill
all labeled for you.
Not yet, Shorty.
Ned Britt.
Yeah. Looks like
this is our lucky day.
Now, keep your sights cool
till he's ripe.
GABE:
Pick it up, sheriff,
and make out like
you got us covered.
And the rest of you
keep your mouths shut
and your hands still,
unless'n you want Shorty
to plug you in the back.
Now, let's us
get our hands up.
GABE:
I only asked
the chance
to raise
my bail, sheriff.
And I'm partial
to a quick hearing.
A word from you with the judge
will help matters a lot.
Sheriff, I owe you
an apology.
Who's got
the drop?
I have.
It ain't my fault,
Britt.
Gabe made me hold
this empty gun.
Two in the bag, Gabe.
And I hear you ain't
particular anymore
about offending
the press.
All right. Why don't you
reach for your gun.
That what he's
trying to do:
make you
use 'em.
He'll claim
it was fair draw.
Guess we couldn't be
that lucky.
Cock-a-doodles like you
hang on to your lives
till the last breath
is squeezed out.
Get your rope, Mort.
All right.
Toss your guns in.
Reminds me of that day
at Saw Hill.
Same bad fix.
Couldn't do anything
about it then.
Can't now.
GABE:
Get rid of them guns.
Don't hurry!
You might catch 'em!
MAN:
Come on,
after 'em!
Hah. Hyah!
You double-crossed
yourself that time
for fair,
didn't you?
Riding double-harness
whether you like it or not.
Don't count
on that.
I said I'd delouse
this burg,
and I haven't
changed my mind.
Ain't nobody yet proved
Ben was wrong about you.
Well,
you prove it.
I'm going to
Dallas tomorrow.
You come
with me.
Watch me sell
those railroad moguls
on drivin'
the line through.
Learn how a man
can play
his honest
opportunities...
without a cent
in his kit.
The way
you played Amy?
I've got buckboards
waiting to take us
from the end of the line
into Fort Worth.
Show you how easy
it'd be
to grade that right away,
Mr. Engineer.
Our agreement was
that you'd lay track
from there on
at your expense.
We're to pay
you back
out of earnings
from Fort Worth.
If any.
Well, times
have changed.
You'll have to
put up the money.
What I thought.
You've learned your cash,
banked over in Dallas,
is better than a lot
of rusted rail.
Or was that money
a dream,
like your talk
about Fort Worth
bein' the great cow town
of the future?
It was no dream,
Sam.
I've got the cash,
but I can't
use it right now.
That was
our agreement.
And I aim
to keep it.
As soon as I get
all the options I wanted.
But a friend of mine has got
a padlock on my cash.
I open it up,
he blows me right out of Texas.
Besides, you don't
need the cash.
Not when
I'm offering you
the best potential
market town in the state.
Lunsford's ridin'
in style.
Yeah. He aims to get
that general manager
to put up
the money
to extend the line
to Fort Worth.
Now, wasn't that obligin'
of that Dallas paper
to keep me
informed?
Well, what are you birds
a-waitin' for?
Go on.
And the products
of my packing plant
are no more than half
of what you'll freight.
Goods of all kinds.
People.
Read our
newspaper.
See how we could
benefit the country
from the gulf
to the Kansas prairie.
Frankly, it was
the
boosted us
into taking another look
at the prospects.
Yeah, I give Britt
full credit.
He brought back old citizens
and new ones too.
Fought by my side
for law and decency.
We wiped out such problems
as Gabe Clevenger--
Friends of yours,
Lunsford?
Clevenger's men.
Any rails are laid
beyond Eagle Ford,
you'll lay 'em.
I'll risk neither
workmen's lives
nor company money
on them.
Looks like luck
has been running
a streak against me,
gentlemen.
You boys know
what supplies to order.
I'll meet you
back here.
Put this
in caps.
New paragraph
here.
Now get to work.
Flora.
Come in.
Howdy,
Miss Talbot.
I, um,
brought you
some news
for the
Good.
The youngest
Henby boy
came down
with the measles.
And there's
a harvest social
at the Dills' ranch
next Thursday.
You're both
invited.
That's pretty
hot news, Luther.
Better get it set up
right away.
We're sure gettin'
a better-lookin' class
of reporter
these days.
Be just as good
if I go to lunch?
Uh, just as good.
So long,
Miss Talbot.
You've made
Luther's day for him.
Sit down, Flora.
The items were
only an excuse.
I wanted to
see you.
You don't need
any excuse for that.
You haven't been
out to the ranch.
I've been busy.
Ben's funeral and--
Not wanting to cut
Blair's fences.
I heard the words
between you
the night
you brought Amy.
Time you learn
no shock will kill
a woman's
curiosity, Ned.
Fella says a lot
of things when he's mad.
I hope you know
how sorry I was about Ben.
That I took
for granted.
And welcome back
into the fold.
Dad would've
kicked the bung
out of a barrel
of mash
celebratin' the gunnin'
you gave Clevenger's men
at the stockyard.
I wonder
if Ben would.
I still believe
the printed word
is stronger
than guns.
Only seeing
him dead...
Makes a difference
when it's a friend.
Been you
instead of Ben...
I'd be on Clevenger's
trail myself.
If it'd
been Blair?
Yes, I'd fight
for Blair.
I'm not a schoolgirl
that never heard of
all the Amy Brookses
in the world.
Blair's walkin'
in four-leaf clover,
having a woman
so broad in the mind.
Hm.
You ought to thank me
for bringin' Amy out.
Tell the truth,
I felt sorry for her.
Her kind have their day,
but it sure ends fast.
She's got claws,
though.
She got to me
when she talked about
the dollar marks
in my eyes.
Oh, don't you
believe it.
I took a quick look
at my bankbook.
That was
reassuring enough.
Any dollar marks
I've got are red ink.
That'll
change.
The railroad
comes through,
Blair's packing plant
starts humming,
and you'll be
fat as a goose.
If that's meant
for a compliment,
you've got a lot
to learn.
Don't keep yourself
such a stranger, Ned.
It gets lonesome
out there.
Blair will
keep you company.
Blair's not
on my visiting list.
But you just said--
I said that
to you.
You don't think
for one minute
I'm not gonna
make him squirm.
Maybe his clover crop
ain't as thick as I figured.
By the way,
where is he?
Far as I know,
still in Dallas.
Dallas?
What for?
Ah, don't worry.
It's not another Amy.
He's arguing
the railroad through.
If he does that, I'll
forgive him awful fast.
Come out
any time, Ned.
Don't wait
for the invitation.
I won't.
I can't pass up the kind
of local news you handle.
Good morning,
Flora.
How are you,
Blair?
You're beginning
to look
more like a lovesick
bull every day.
What's
the matter?
Won't Flora moo
when you bellow?
Don't swing
on the gate, sonny.
You might get
a bellyful of horns.
You may as well
get yourself reconciled.
I'm the one
she's gonna marry.
Why? Because
she spoke to you?
I heard her say hello
to a yapping dog
out on the trail.
Oh, I guess I can savvy
an insult when I hear one.
I don't have to have
a barn fall on me.
But that's no way
to treat a fellow
that's bringing you
some bang-up news.
You won your argument
with the railroad.
No. I lost it
hands down.
Clevenger's men
shot up the train.
There ain't nobody
can take a hint
faster than
railroaders.
That's hard news,
Blair.
Fort Worth will die without--
LUTHER:
Mr. Lunsford?
Yeah, son?
I owe you an apology,
Mr. Lunsford.
Well, that's
a manly thing to say.
What for?
Well, I've been
distrustful of you.
But that meeting over at
the hotel proved me wrong.
I told you I had
some real hot news.
What meeting?
The Panthers
Club.
We're going to
get the railroad.
They're gonna get their own
free labor to lay track.
And Mr. Walter and the other
deputies will protect 'em
against Clevenger...
o-or anybody else.
But it was Mr. Lunsford here
who got 'em up to it.
I'm proud
of 'em.
You should be
too, Ned.
You created them,
kind of.
They're
big now.
Better than 200
good grizzly boys.
I gotta
set type.
They got
the muscles maybe,
but it takes cash to pay
for feed and materials.
Here's another item
for Luther to set.
"Mr. Blair Lunsford
has announced
"that on Tuesday next,
"he will ship $50,000
in gold by train to Eagle Ford
"to defray all cost
of construction
of the railroad."
Gold sounds better.
So Ben was right.
You've been crying poor
and buying up options
for 10 cents
on the dollar.
And all the time
you had a big kitty
buried in Dallas.
By japes, boy,
you've got it.
That fine old
Southern honor,
that good old
integrity.
I told you I pin
one skunk act on you,
I'd print you
out of the state.
This is the hole in the fence
I've been waiting for.
Well, don't jump through
that hole too soon, son.
You might tear
your britches.
There won't be a nickel
on that train.
What you holding
in that head of yours?
We've got to get rid of
the threat of Clevenger,
haven't we?
Well, he and his boys
oughta be pretty hungry by now.
That item
in your paper
ought to make
sure-fire bait.
You've set yourself
a pretty good rattrap.
And we'll load the train
with Panther cats
just to make sure.
No.
We don't want
any noise around here.
Gabe's got
big ears.
You and me...
we'll be
the express guides.
I'll make the arrangements
in Dallas.
The railroad company,
they won't be so tough
to handle
once we bury
Clevenger.
And he'll strike
a blow any time
to keep work
from starting.
And the money.
Talk about incentive.
Then you're with me.
You'll print it.
I'm already writing
his obituary.
Figured Clevenger's
gang would show
when we hit
open country.
Yeah, after all the trouble
I went through at the railroad
to promote
this trap.
It cost
a king's ransom
to hire a short-handed
train crew.
Thought
you were broke.
Since Clevenger
stayed out of this,
I'm worse off
than that.
What if
he hadn't?
You were supposed
to line up
some good gun hands
in Dallas.
I'll look for
a full load
instead of those
empty coaches.
Why?
We got nothing
to protect
but some mail-order goods
for the farmers.
Two bits will get you four
if we don't pass that coach.
Still looking
for a soft touch?
I only hope
Clevenger ain't.
That's why
we're here.
Be a horse on me
if he passed up the train
and held up
that stagecoach.
I wouldn't give him
pocket money.
You call $100,000
pocket money?
What the--?
What tune
you singing now?
Little by little,
I'm movin' all my cash
to the bank
at Fort Worth.
I can't put it off
any longer, son.
Not even
on your threat
to print me out of
the governorship.
Serves me right.
I should've
known Ben
was the only man
to trust.
You had
fair warning.
Money sure
polluted you.
You used to believe
in a fair draw.
Made kind of a nice
setup for me, didn't it?
You were number one,
and Gabe was second.
And I figured
he'd plug you
if I gotta fire
the shot myself.
Seems like my luck
is running out.
The higher I stack the chips,
the worse it goes.
Even staked
your life on it.
If a man wants to hit
the jackpot, Ned,
he's gotta
take chances.
Oh, if I get killed,
of course, I'd regret it.
But Fort Worth would build
a whopping-big pigeon roost
of a monument
to old Blair.
You'll
get buzzards.
Not from you.
Move back.
Keep your hands
away from those guns.
I'm givin' you
one straight choice.
And I'm offerin' to
make you rich too.
You ride with me,
and I'll take care of you.
Big.
Well, what's
your answer?
Insane.
You're stark-crazy
insane.
They said that
about a lot of men.
Columbus,
Washington...
old Sam Houston.
He was insane too,
with his dream
of Texas...
till he made it
come true.
Now me.
Suit yourself.
I'm insane too...
till I'm sittin'
in the saddle,
and Fort Worth
is queen of the prairie.
And no two-for-a-penny
newspaper
is gonna stop me--
It's Britt
and Lunsford.
Let 'em burn. They're
better than the money.
We've gotta stop
the train now--
Don't slow down till
we get to the water tower.
Express car's
afire.
Gabe said not to move in
with the horses
till they pass
the water tower.
What he said ain't
what he'll be sayin' now.
We gotta get him
and the boys off of there.
Let's go.
Hyah!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Ned.
Oh, Ned, I've been
so worried about you.
Worried?
Well, how'd you
know that...?
Blair, it's Ned.
Isn't that wonderful?
Wonderful ain't
good enough.
Come on in, boy,
and sit down.
You must be
tuckered.
Fix yourself a drink.
I was just telling Flora
how I got fouled up--
Played it smart,
didn't you?
You knew I couldn't
work on you here.
Work on me?
You loco, boy?
Ned, what's
the matter?
Let him
tell you.
He'll make it
a good story
with that rattlesnake
charm of his.
What happened, Ned?
Did you land on your head
when Gabe kicked you
off the train?
This kind of a thing
can be serious.
Take care
of him, honey.
I'll send
Doc Wilson out.
Get yourself
fresh guns, Blair.
I'm giving you
a better choice
than you gave me.
You've got till
tomorrow morning
to make sure that paper
don't come out.
You wait
longer,
I'll print you
out of Texas.
Ned, Blair...
you have no cause
to quarrel.
This is the way
we should be:
together.
This way too.
Look after
yourself, boy.
What are you
doing?
Pointing a gun.
I aim to use it
on Blair.
He's right.
You are insane.
Not me. Blair.
His crooked dream got too big
for one man's head to hold.
Only a crazy man would rig it
to swindle every friend he had
and still want Texas
to lift him up in glory.
He couldn't have
done that.
I'm going to set print
on him tonight.
And if he's to stop me,
he'll have to kill me.
He's your friend.
He wouldn't shoot
to stop you
even if you printed
a pack of lies.
Then you'd better
stop me.
You seem to have picked
your man to fight for.
I haven't picked
anybody.
Keep your gun.
I could
use it too.
Anybody who'd try to
destroy somebody I loved.
Then why don't you...
while you've still
got a chance
to sit in the throne
room at Austin?
All ready to
pull a proof,
as soon as you
give me copy
to fill that space
you wanted saved.
I told you
to clear out.
Uh-- Soon as I set
the type for your story.
Must be a humdinger, the way
you've been sweatin' on it.
Clear out now.
I don't want you
around here.
Somebody's got to
cover the Panthers
starting to lay track.
I can still
set type.
Well, if you're sure
you can get on without me.
I won't
let you down, Luther.
Paper will come out
on schedule.
You ought to keep
that door locked.
Don't want it
locked.
The way you messed up
Clevenger's bunch on that train,
he'll be feelin'
peevish.
Fort Worth's the last place
he'd show himself.
Well, it'll be
a lonely place,
what with every man,
woman and mule
off to work
the railroad.
Includin' me.
Everybody from
the fire department
to the Ladies'
Cooking Society.
Oh. You printin' up how
Lunsford saved the day
with the cash
he brought in?
Well, something
like that.
Hear he hocked his warts
to buy the rails.
Ah, you know,
Mr. Britt,
public spirit like that's
just mighty scarce.
We ought to build
a monument to him
while he's livin'.
The way he's livin',
there mightn't be much time.
Pride of
the old Lone Star.
You ought to keep
that door locked.
You're the second one
said that.
I expected you
by the front door.
What were you after,
a potshot?
Didn't want anybody
to see me come in.
I aim to go out
the same way.
The undertaker's
right across the alley.
It won't be too far
to tote you.
Setting up
your little story?
That's it.
Just in case
somebody does pass by,
you're here alone,
as you should be.
Don't go getting
buck ague.
I'll give you
a fair draw.
Just keep your hands
away from those guns.
You talk to Flora
about this?
It's any comfort,
she'll believe no bad of you.
I knew she wouldn't.
I've been thinkin' a lot
about her this evening.
About you and me.
Women. Half the time
they don't understand
what a fella's talkin' about.
You can't make
conversation
with a pile of
greenbacks.
Then give it up.
Let those options lapse,
and the property will go back
to the people you bilked.
They will lapse
if you are dead.
I'm talkin' about life,
Ned, not death.
Big, juicy
wonderful life.
It's like I was tryin' to tell
you when you first came home.
You grab the crossroads.
If it's a treasure-trove,
then the world's
your watermelon.
My offer's still good.
We can slice it
fifty-fifty, you and me.
Neither of us.
Then it's spin
the wheel, and...
see what comes up.
It's
your decision.
Always figured
I was faster than you.
But I figured wrong.
Go on, shoot, boy.
Shut up. Listen to me.
Shoot, you fool,
or you'll be losin'.
Ned? Are you
all right, Ned?
I had to see the truth
to believe it.
I picked my side,
but I didn't mean
to kill him.
I only fired once,
and he fell.
Say that again.
What?
You only fired once.
What difference does
it make? I killed him.
Who knows?
There were two shots.
Somebody else
was in there with us.
Ned!
Better get on
down there.
Well, just as soon as I get
some of this ink washed off.
It's mighty fancy.
Look at page three.
Thank you, Ned.
Thank old Ben Garvin.
He made the rules
for the paper.
One was never to
pitchfork the dead.
You all comin' along?
We can see fine
from here, Luther.
Well, then, see you at supper.
So long, Mrs. Britt.
Mrs. Britt.
And you were ready to
plug me once, almost.
Almosts don't count.
It's a different town
than you rode into
the first time, Ned.
Different than the one
I came back to.
It's a good town.
Good town for little Toby
to grow up in.
Toby? Why,
he got killed by--
Why, High Pocket,
I clear forgot
to tell you,
didn't I?
Why did you think I didn't want
to go down there?
Want to stay out
of the crowds?
You'll have to
take better care
of your boy's mother, boy.
