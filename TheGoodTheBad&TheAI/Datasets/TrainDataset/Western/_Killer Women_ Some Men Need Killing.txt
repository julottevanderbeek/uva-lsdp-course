- Parker!
- What's up, babe?
Not you. Your sister.
State trooper
to Texas ranger.
You would never bed me
for intel on a D.E.A. investigation.
We can't keep doing this.
There is no way that I'm risking
my informants on a raid into Mexico.
Sign the divorce papers, or
I'll tell the world who you really are.
you got cursed,
you got burnt
something that
no one deserves
You are such a brave boy.
Well, it's not like
it's a straight edge.
Still... I could hurt you.
Exactly.
Oh, so you really are
that guy?
Yeah. I'm really that guy.
For the first time
in your life
- Ah! No way.
- What?
- We're late.
- Huh?
Uh, what is this thing?
Where are we going, again?
Fund-raiser for the ranger company
captain's favorite charity.
Right. Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that the same dress?
- Same gun, too.
Oh.
Mm.
Molls.
- Didn't expect to see you here.
- Likewise.
My ex-husband.
Actually, uh,
not quite yet.
- Senator Colton. Call me Jake.
- Jake, Dan.
- Special agent Winston.
- Oh, yeah? What, FBI?
- D.E.A.
- D.E.A.?
Listen, I gotta thank you guys.
You do a hell of a job out there.
So, Molls, I'll see you in court
on Thursday, right?
Jake, all you have to do is
sign the divorce papers.
You've had
more than half a year.
Well, let's let the judge
handle that, okay?
I'll see you Thursday.
Special agent.
Get back!
Waiter!

"Some Men Need Killing"

Someone put an ad on Craiglist.
$50 to show up at 10:00.
The tray, white shirt,
and black pants.
The latest thing.
A college kid robbed a bank
at Brownsville.
Disappeared into a flash mob
of sanitation workers.
- And you're impressed?
- It was clever.
Ranger Zea?
It's an honor, sir.
Are the rangers taking this?
Well, Ranger Parker and I
were on scene,
so if it's helpful, we can
stay involved.
- Always.
- What do you have, Lieutenant?
The, uh, deceased is
a Clete Reed of Barton Creek.
Guy owns a crap-ton of water parks
across central Texas.
- Any consistency in witness statements?
- Yes.
Five people say they saw a waiter
moving away from the victim.
- Male or female?
- Well, two say female. Three say male.
Pricey knife.
Bench-made, spring assist.
One swipe clean through
the internal jugular and carotid.
- Precise. This was a pro.
- Y'all think this is a murder for hire?
It's possible. Do we know
if the victim was here with anyone?
No, he was alone. Were able
to get ahold of his wife, though.
She's at a private clinic,
recuperating from surgery.
- What kind of surgery?
- Elective.
Mrs. Reed? I'm Molly Parker,
Texas Rangers.
Oh. Hi.
I'm here to talk to you
about Mr. Reed's passing.
Um, the police came last night.
I talked to them already.
- I know.
- You do?
I work in conjunction
with the local police.
We're specialized investigators.
Sort of the FBI at the state level.
I'm also here because I was at the event
when your husband was killed.
You were there?
The, uh, police told me that
poor Clete's throat was slashed.
- Is that true?
- It is. It happened very quickly.
Somebody cut his throat,
so he had time to know he was...
He was gonna die.
And... and I should've
been there, by his side.
If I hadn't insisted
on these implants...
Do you know if your husband
had enemies?
Huh?
That would kill him?
Uh... no one.
Married over 22 years.
I don't really know
what I'm gonna do now.
You should rest.
My condolences, Mrs. Reed.
I'm Nan, please.
Um, I'm just...
- I prefer "Nan."
- Okay.
How's your mood?
I spoke to the victim's wife
last night.
Her husband had no enemies.
He was "an angel".
That's an interesting
point of view for a wife.
All right, don't drop it, but I got
someone else I want you to look at...
Mr. Reed's ex-business partner.
They split up their water park
company two years ago.
Reed's half prospered.
The partner went broke
and claimed Reed swindled him.
The, uh, state legislature
investigated.
- No. No way. You do it.
- Jake led the investigation.
He's gonna be a lot happier
spending time with you than with me.
We're getting
a divorce in three days.
And that's not relevant
to this investigation.
I don't know why
they don't just spend
the extra million
to fix up the Back Nine.
I'm gonna light a fire under
Goldstein's ass. Watch me.
Lunch on the People's dime,
gentlemen?
Wow! Hi!
Guys, you remember, uh,
you remember my wife Molly.
- Always a pleasure, Mrs. Colton.
- It's Ranger... Parker.
I need to speak
to senator Colton about a case.
All righty then.
- Jake, meet you back at the Capitol?
- Sounds good.
Ranger...
- Here, have a seat.
- I'll stand.
You got a real nasty way
about you right now.
I don't wanna fight
with you, Jake.
I mean, correcting your name
in front of my associates?
We're getting a divorce in three days.
Time to face reality.
- Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
- How do you mean?
How's it going
with your D.E.A. agent?
I ran a background
check on him, by the way.
You did what?
I'm lookin' after you,
Molly.
I'm trying to be civil
as I can, given what you did to me,
but everybody
has a breaking point.
- Don't mess with me.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
How can I be
of service to you?
I understand
your Senate committee
investigated the man
that was murdered last night.
Yeah. God, that
was horrible, wasn't it?
- Who was he?
- He was a bad, bad man.
He was corrupt, and he was a bully.
Made L.B.J. to look like a pussycat.
How so?
Well, he owned
water parks across the state.
A couple of years back,
he and his partner, Kirk Denby,
had this really bad falling out.
So they split the company in half.
Each of them got six parts.
- Why investigate Reed?
- 'Cause, uh...
He was trying to bribe
the Water Commission.
That last drought we had... when all the
restrictions got put into place... well...
Reed's parks got water.
- And the partner's didn't?
- Bone dry. Lost everything.
Ever try going down
a water slide with no water in it?
Your ass heats up
pretty quick.
Give my love
to your family.
- You really just said that?
- And I really did mean it.
You were right. We need to speak
to Reed's ex-partner.
Austin P.D. just called.
I know exactly
where to find him.
Whoo-hoo! That son of a bitch
is dead!
He's dead! Dead!
Denby! You need
to come on down now!
Hey, look who's on top
of the world now, huh?!
Takin' it pretty hard,
isn't he?
You need a little more
water for your slide?!
Denby! Get the hell
Now!
Maybe killing him
wasn't enough.
He was a right son of a bitch,
and I got nothing nice to say,
even if it lands me in jail.
Where were you last night,
Mr. Denby?
At home by myself.
Got nobody to go out with now.
I've got the stink of broke
all over me.
All because of Clete Reed,
isn't that right?
Oh, but now the good Lord
has noticed his despicable ways.
Well, sweet justice was served.
With a little help from you.
If the good Lord needs my help,
we're in worse shape than I thought.
We think Mr. Reed was killed
by a professional assassin.
Maybe one you hired.
How does a broke man
hire an assassin?
There's lots of people who might
have wanted Clete dead,
from people he did business with
to that sweet little wife of his.
His wife?
Yeah, have you seen the poor lady?
Stitched up like Frankenstein.
You're referring to Mrs. Reed's
plastic surgery?
Old Clete had sent her out to get
carved on every time the fancy struck.
Liposuction, breast enlargement,
the tummy tuck.
If he thought she was looking
a little fat,
he took away the car and made her
walk to the grocery store.
Figured that adding an obstacle to eating
would keep down her dress size.
Punishment by plastic surgery...
That's a new one.
I think Mrs. Reed
is worth a look.
You said she told you they were happy,
that her husband doted on her.
Except her doting husband
didn't check her in for surgery
or call to see how she was doing, and
she wasn't wearing her wedding ring.
Don't the diamonds come off
before you go under the knife?
She didn't want me to call her
by her husband's last name,
just her first name... Nan.
You know that's just
being friendly, right?
If I hated my husband enough
to have him killed,
I wouldn't want to be killed
by his last name either.
I'll remember that.
She wanted the details
of how he died,
and then she imagined it
like she wanted to live it.
If her marriage
was that bad...
I never understand why
people don't just leave.
Because some women can't, particularly
if they blame themselves for the abuse.
- Hey, bro.
- Hey.
- Aunt Molly! I got into the swim team.
- That is awesome!
Hailee got a C-minus
in English.
That's not awesome
and also none of your business.
That's what mom said.
Please. She's gross.
Tell me who hasn't tapped that.
- Total ho.
- Ho?
Not nice.
I need a blouse
for a memorial service.
Why are you sniffing that?
-  I'm not.
- You were.
I, um... I like the smell of my husband.
Don't be such a ranger.
- And you're going through his pockets.
- I didn't do that.
You're lying.
What's going on?
I'm being a good housewife
and I'm doing the laundry.
Uh-huh.
In your comfort slippers?
What's got you upset?
Molly, seriously, I hate it when
you drill me like you are right now.
That's a diversion.
Your eyes went down,
so I know it's something
you don't wanna talk about.
I don't wanna talk
about it.
You think my brother's...
Just pick a blouse from the closet
and get out of my room.
- We're gonna come back to this.
-  Out.
Ranger Parker.
Did you arrest someone?
No, not yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
I was going to wait to speak to you
until after the memorial was over.
Well, now's all right.
Uh, I wanna help you
in any way that I can.
I spoke to your husband's
ex business partner, Kirk Denby.
Oh, Kirk? He's a...
he's a bankrupt alcoholic.
He said your husband abused you,
emotionally and physically.
Abu... well, that...
That's a terrible thing
to say about a man who's dead.
Kirk Denby... he's the one
who hated Clete.
He did.
But he didn't have money
to hire a professional assassin.
Nan, did your husband
abuse you in any way?
Well, we fought sometimes.
I mean, who doesn't?
I was looking
at those photos.
Your breasts got bigger
during your marriage.
That... that is vulgar.
How... are my breasts in any way
related to a murder investigation?
And now they're smaller
again.
You had your implants removed
the same day your husband was murdered.
Is that something
he would have approved of?
Clete and I discussed
the surgery.
I decided to have the implants
removed because they caused me pain.
You've had a lot of that
in your life, haven't you?
People snap, Nan, especially
when they feel trapped and afraid.
- Well, what does that have to do with me?
- I hope nothing.
I know she ordered
the hit.
You know it, or you got one
of those feelings in your gut?
He forced his wife
to have surgery, repeatedly.
She went from a 32B
to a 36E. Disgusting.
Well, depends on the hips, really.
According to his ex business partner,
the guy was a sadistic monster.
You see
a 7/8 wrench down there?
Thing is, Mrs. Reed never had more
than $400 in her account.
Her husband controlled
the money, too.
Well, $400 ain't buying you
a professional assassin.
- You're talking 25K at least.
- I know.
But maybe she secretly
squirreled away some cash.
What, and buried it
in the backyard?
If I find the money and follow it,
I can find the hit man as well.
My guess...
He's long gone.
A lady can still hope.
Lady wanna go up
on the plane?
- No.
- Why not?
- How do I know it's fixed?
- Are you questioning my skills right now?
- Look. She's good and solid.
- Yeah, but is he?
In the right hands.
Don't you trust me?
I, um, I really
don't wanna talk to you.
- It's my job to be persistent.
- Do I, uh, need to contact my attorney?
- Do you need one?
- No. No, no, no.
I have nothing to hide,
Ranger Parker, so...
- Come in.
- Thank you, and it's Molly.
Molly.
Are you moving?
Yes. I'm originally from Connecticut,
so I'm going back.
I may ask you
to stick around.
- Because I'm a suspect?
- Yes, ma'am.
I don't lie to people,
Nan,
and I'm trained to know
when people are lying to me.
So you think that
by saying that,
you're gonna get me to confess
to a crime that I didn't commit?
I think you're lying when
you say you loved your husband.
No training can tell you
what is in a person's heart.
Did you know that every time
I mention your husband,
you cross your arms or touch
some part of your body,
maybe to reassure yourself that
it's yours and not his anymore?
I've just lost the only man
that I've ever been with.
So...
Maybe I cross my arms because
I'm alone and... it reassures me.
I know what kind of man
your husband was, Nan.
I know he controlled your body
and how he controlled your finances
and kept you on a very tight
budget despite his success.
You should look around.
I mean, does it look like I've been
living in distress for 22 years?
Is this your collection?
My husband's.
He collected
native American artifacts.
- Comanche?
- Um, I'm not sure.
It's something our interior
designer helped Clete acquire.
- Who's your interior designer?
- Jennifer Jennings. Why?
Just conversation.
Uh-huh.
Thank you for your time.
Yes, I love this one.
Very rare.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Be prettier if it were real.
- Come again?
- The vase is fake.
It was fired in a kiln,
not dried in the sun.
I know a fair amount
about comanche pottery.
I was obsessed with comanches
as a kid.
Seeing as your last name
is Parker.
Yes, ma'am. My family
goes back to Cynthia Anne
and the first settlers
of West Texas.
Isn't that interesting?
The vase is real.
I got it from a dealer
in Dallas for $35,000.
Hang on.
Sherry, can you please pull
the invoices for the Reed job?
I'll get you the bill of sale and
the paperwork to authenticate it.
Did you come here because
you thought I cheated a client?
Actually, no. I came here to
confirm you hadn't.
- Oh.
-  There you go.
Thank you.
There you go.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
That's your money trail.
That vase was sold at auction
co-signed by an anonymous seller,
who had to be Nan Reed.
- Navajo?
- Comanche.
Clete Reed bought
that vase for his collection.
Nan replaced it with a fake and
sold the original to pay for a hit man.
Easy as apple pie.
- Why do you always eat my food?
-  I have motive.
- I have money.
- But no proof.
- I wanna put a tap on her phone.
- You're nowhere near probable cause.
You know how these deals go down.
Half up-front, half on completion.
- Maybe she'll contact the hit man.
- Fine. Surveil her.
I'm gonna get 'em both, Lieutenant...
Nan Reed and the hit man.
Right after you get me
another slice of pie.
I had... one bite.
Whatcha doin', Nan?
Where you goin'?
That was fast.
Hello, handsome.
Bingo.
Sir? Can I have a word?
Texas Ranger. I need you
to hand me the bag.
Nan, you're going to jail for
commissioning your husband's murder.
Why, because I was in the same park
as... as a man who got shot?
Because I have a photo of you
tossing this bag of cash
into a trash can right before
the man who was shot picked it up.
The assassin who killed
your husband
killed the middleman
because he could identify him.
Assassin? Middleman?
I'm a housewife.
You're a victim of abuse,
and your attorney will use that
as a mitigating circumstance
when the state asks
for the death penalty.
You're not in Connecticut
anymore, Nan.
It's time you tell me
everything you know.
Molly...
Please, wait. Don't leave.
I-I couldn't... I couldn't take it
anymore, you know? I just...
I tried, and I... and I thought that if
I did everything that my husband wanted,
if I... if I had the surgeries, if I...
if I stayed thin and young-looking,
then his hatred for me
would go away.
But it never did.
I disgusted my own husband,
and then one day
I just started hating myself
the same way that Clete hated me,
and I put my head down.
I didn't look up again.
Then what happened?
What made you hire a hit man?
I didn't... decide...
To hire a hit man.
The devil came up from hell
one day and found me.
Sat down beside me
at a juice bar
and told me he could put
an end to all my suffering.
That was the man
at the park?
He knew all about my marriage,
the surgeries, the fits, the beatings.
- How could he know that?
- I don't know.
No name, no number...
He was just an answer to my prayers.
Told me it would cost me
$30,000 to have Clete killed
and I could meet him down at a coffee
shop downtown when I was ready.
And I didn't do anything
at first.
- But then...
- Something happened?
Maybe almost nothing?
And all the pain
came pouring out?
I know what
that feels like, Nan.
What was it?
He threw away
my girl scout cookies.
The next day,
I put that vase up for sale.
Nice job, Ranger.
After 22 years of trying to make
a wicked man happy, she finally snapped.
Sent him to hell.
Police tossed the apartment
of the dead bag man.
No leads to who he was
working for, but they did find this.
Frequent customer card
from the coffee shop where
he did his business with Nan Reed.
He's a regular.
Stamped nine times.
Tenth cup is free.
He had other clients.
You're for real? I thought
all rangers were dudes.
- Have you seen that man?
- Yeah. A few times.
He used to come in
and chat up women.
- Like this one?
- She was one.
- She was sad. Sorta shy.
- Who else?
They all looked the same to me...
Middle-aged, defeated, desperate.
Do you know any
of their names?
One.
She was more confident
than your girl in the picture.
- Had a lot more... Going on.
- You're a real Dr. Freud.
I understand women. Maybe
that's why they like me so much.
She asked me to give her
a call, but I'm taken.
At least until someone better
comes along.
Ow!
Hello?
Ow.
Hello?
I'm Ranger Parker. I'm here
to speak to Maggie Tanner.
You got her.
What can I do for ya?
I'd like to speak to you
for a few minutes
about your husband's
unfortunate passing.
- My husband's right here.
- The one before.
Bobby Dean was much older...
I think about 32 years.
- You think?
- Well, he always lied about his age.
Not that I cared.
Old is old, and rich is rich.
Our marriage was contractual.
He wanted pretty on his arm.
I wanted money on my finger.
But then he died.
Yes, he did.
Heart stopped, I guess.
He tipped off his fishing boat.
He had his nitro pills with him.
Just didn't get one under his tongue
before the ticker blew up.
They never did find
Bobby Dean's body, did they?
- No, not yet.
- It's been three years?
Well, it'll turn up eventually.
Won't be pretty.
Do you know this man?
Uh... nope. Don't know him.
Should I?
I have a witness who says
he met you at a coffee shop.
- The Texas Grind?
- The Texas Grind?
Well, now I like men,
but I gotta tell ya,
I forget them
as easily as I meet them,
that is until one sticks,
like Andy.
- Can I get you a bite to eat?
- No, no. I'm good.
You sure?
But if you don't mind,
who's your designer?
- House or clothes?
- House. That's a beautiful screen.
That's Jennifer Jennings.
She got that for me.
I can get you her number
if you like.
No, actually, I know
exactly where to find her.
Well, you give Jenny-Jen
a big ol' hug for me.
Oh, I will.
And I'm gonna dredge the river
and find your husband's body
and make sure the coroner finds
a clear cause of death,
just in case
there was foul play involved.
It's turning out
to be a pretty good day.
Well, you sound happy.
I've got a lead on my case, and tomorrow
Jake Colton will no longer be my husband.
Are you sure you wanna give up
the perks of being a senator's wife?
- I don't wanna be anybody's wife.
- Oh, so you're  girl.
I'm working on a case where the husband
forced his wife to have four tummy tucks.
Not exactly
in a wedding bell mood.
How long have you been
an interior designer?
It's always been a passion.
But it didn't become a business until
after your husband was murdered.
And here I was, thinking
you needed advice on curtains.
He was mugged in an alley.
Is that correct?
Stabbed in the heart
with a hunting knife.
- Dramatic.
- No witnesses, nobody ever arrested?
Yes.
It was a tragedy.
Your husband was killed
in an alley
behind a hotel where he rented
a room several times a week?
We lived way outside of town. Sometimes
Nick stayed in Austin on business.
Your husband was killed
just after 3:00 in the afternoon.
If I had to guess, he had
a lunch meeting at the hotel.
Actually, he rented a room
and then ordered from room service
a $200 bottle of champagne.
Marriages can be
so complicated, Ranger Parker.
How about yours? You're married
to Senator Colton, isn't that right?
Separated.
Oh, yes. I heard
the divorce is contentious.
- Now how would you know that?
- I decorate for some politicians.
People talk, especially
when you're in their homes.
You do have a good supply
of clients, don't you?
After my husband died,
I never felt the call to remarry.
I built a business
instead.
Could've gone back to Missouri,
where you were born on a farm.
Clearly, that's not
a question.
Your father was
an outdoorsman, a hunter...
Skilled. He taught you.
We've spoken
for several minutes now,
and I'm still not sure
of the purpose of your visit.
Does the D.P.S. office
need a redo?
No,
we could never afford you.
- Well, I am rather expensive.
- Yeah.
Yeah, my guess...
about 30 grand a job.
Mm, that would be
on the low end.
My level of expertise
does not come cheaply.
Bobby Dean Tanner...
Fell off his boat.
Clete Reed...
Throat slashed.
Jason Noonan suffered
a grand mal seizure,
even though he had no
former neurological issues.
And you...
You redecorated
all their houses.
Maybe they die
when they get my bill.
I couldn't understand
how the middleman
knew so much about the lives
of these women,
but now it makes sense.
Women talk to their decorators.
She was in their homes
and got inside their minds.
But now I'm inside hers.
She'd be stupid to try and kill
anybody else while I'm watching.
- A lot of unhappy people out there, huh?
- Yeah, I was one of 'em.
Come on. Give me
that backstory now.
Nope.
No, that I won't do.
- I won't bring Jake into our life.
- It's not about him. It's about me,
understanding that part of your past.
It means something to me.
Why?
At some point,
it'd be nice to be trusted.
- I trust you.
- Yeah.
Try me. See if I run.
Oh, you are so gonna wish
you didn't walk out on that limb.
- Go on...
- Get in my plane.
- That was a cheap trick.
- Said you trusted me.
- Anything else.
- Anything?
All rise.
Superior Court for the State
of Texas, county of Travis,
the honorable
Judge Walter Garrity presiding.
I don't believe it.
He's a friend of Jake's.
Everybody's
a friend of Jake's.
Be seated.
Senator Colton...
Ranger Parker.
Nice to see you again.
Now I have before me
your petition for divorce.
Yes, your Honor, the couple's
been separated for nearly a year.
Their differences
are irreconcilable.
- Senator, you feel the same?
- No, judge, I don't.
I believe there's hope.
I'm a very hopeful person.
Well, it does take two to be
irreconcilable, doesn't it?
Sort of like
takes two not to tango?
I thought we were here
to just sign the final papers.
Now, Ranger Parker,
marriage is an institution
highly valued by the state,
the community,
not to mention the Church, and if there
is a hope of saving any marriage,
we all share a duty
to make that attempt.
This marriage is over.
I am the judge here, Ranger Parker,
and it ain't over till I say it's over.
Now I'm gonna put
this petition on hold
until you can undergo
a course in marriage counseling.
- Your Honor...
- Wasn't that clear?
Thank you, Judge.
We'll give it our best shot.
Why are you doing this?
Uh, excuse me, fellas. I...
- Why are you doing this?
- Easy. Careful.
Because I believe our marriage
is worth fighting for.
You don't control me. You don't
have that right anymore.
If you really wanted out,
you would've already told the world
what you think happened.
What happened?
That the good and honorable
Senator beat his wife?
- Molly...
- Sign the damn papers!
Just a few
counseling sessions.
Your lawyer has to fight this, and if
he can't, we need to get you a new one.
Yeah, for a thousand
dollars an hour.
No wonder women hire hit men.
I'll kill that son of a bitch
for free...
If I could find my damn rifle.
You seen my varmint gun?
- In the tack room.
- No.
Don't forget you have to take Lu
to swim practice tonight.
Ohh.
- D-don't tell me. Don't...
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- I can't.
- You're busy again?
You need to tell me
what is going on right now,
- ...and I want the truth.
- I have to go into town.
- Why?
- What is this? The Mexican Inquisition?
I need parts, okay?
The irrigation system in the back
pasture is all messed up.
I need to fix it, that's all.
And after the sun sets is
the only time the stores are open?
Don't do that, Molls.
I'm not one of your suspects.
Fine. Go. I'll take Lu.
It's a pleasure to spend time
with my children.
Why don't you
wanna swim, daddy?
I do wanna go swimming with
you, Lu, but daddy's gotta work, okay?
Go. Now. I mean it.
Mama's gonna drive you.
Let's go get your fins. Come on.
- Becca, don't go there.
- He's screwing around.
I know it. I know it.
- How's it going, Ryan?
- I'm good out here, Ms. Parker.
- Irrigation pump holding?
- Sure is.
-  System been down?
- No, ma'am. Not this season.

Hi.
Are you really signing
the divorce papers?
Uh, no.
Then what the hell
was that text?
What text?
Look at your damn phone!
You just sent me a text saying
you signed the divorce papers.
I'm looking at it. I...
___
I didn't send that.
I was in the shower.
I just stepped out.
Jake, listen to me.
Hello? Jake?
Jake!
What is this?
What do you want?!
Why does your wife
hate you so much?
The mere mention of your name
makes her recoil.
Ugh! Okay,
clearly you're insane.
No.
I'm just a woman who has a talent
and makes a living from it.
What, breaking into homes
and tying people up?
- Good for you.
- Oh, no.
I kill people.
Men... when their wives
don't want them around anymore.
Women pay me to make sure
they never have to wake up again next
to the person they hate most in life.
Like your wife...
She really doesn't want you
around anymore.
And that's a good thing
for me...
Uhh!
Ranger Parker
is good at her job.
Too good.
I'm a State Senator.
There are security cameras
all around this house.
Unfortunately, the one
in the the back is out of order.
Stuff happens.
In a few minutes,
Molly Parker will arrive.
Her image will be clear on the front
door camera and also her intent.
You sent her a text message saying
you signed the divorce papers.
Unfortunately, you're drunk...
When she gets here.
You tell her you changed
your mind again.
She's outraged.
You tell her you'll never
let her go.
She can't take it anymore.
Furious, the righteous Ranger
finally snaps and shoots you...
Right between the two...
Beady... little...
Eyes...
With this rifle,
the one they keep in the shed
at the Parker ranch.
A fine ranger will go to jail for
the rest of her life for this, but hell...
Some men just need killing.
Ohh!
Aah!
Uhh!
You should've let me kill
that arrogant bastard.
Uhh!
If I wanted Jake dead,
I'd kill him myself.
Uhh!
Ouch.
Complicated way to get law
enforcement off her scent.
- Why not just kill you?
-  Are you kidding?
If Jennings killed a ranger, every
cop in Texas would be on the case.
Forget every cop in Texas.
That woman would have
to deal with me.
Well, that was eventful.
I just saved your life.
Sign the damn papers.
No.
I'm never coming
back to you.
- I find that very hard to believe.
- Trust me.
Hey.
How steady is she?
Strong enough
that you can lean on.
I wanna find a place
You're safe.
I believe you.
