SPI RIT :
The story that I want to tell you
cannot be found in a book.
They say the history of the West
was written
from the saddle of a horse
but it's never been told
from the heart of one...
not till now.
I was born here
in this place that would come
to be called the Old West
but to my kind,
the land was ageless.
It had no beginning
and no end...
no boundary
between earth and sky.
Like the wind
in the buffalo grass
we belonged here.
We would always belong here.
They say the mustang
is the spirit of the West.
Whether that West was won
or lost in the end
you'll have to decide for yourself
but the story
I want to tell you is true.
I was there, and I remember.
I remember the sun and the sky
and the wind calling my name
in a time when wild horses ran free.
##
##
# Here I am #
#This is me #
# I come into this world
so wild and free #
# Here I am #
# So young and strong #
# Right here in the place
where I belong #
# It's a new world #
# It's a new start #
# It's alive with the beating
of a young heart #
# It's a new day #
# In a new land #
#And it's waiting for me #
# Here I am #
# Oh, it's a new world #
# It's a new start #
# It's alive with the beating
of a young heart #
#Yeah, it's a new day #
# In a new land #
#And it's waiting for me #
# Here I am #
And so I grew from colt to stallion
as wild and reckless
as thunder over the land
racing with the eagle,
soaring with the wind.
Flying?
There were times I believed I could.
Like my father before me
I became leader
of the Cimarron herd
and with that honor...
came responsibility.
# I hear the wind across the plain #
#A sound so strong that calls my name #
# It's wild like the river #
# It's warm like the sun #
#Yeah, it's here #
#This is where I belong #
# Under the starry skies #
#Where eagles have flown #
#This place is paradise #
# It's the place I call home #
CHORUS:
#The moon on the mountains #
#The whisper through the trees #
#The waves on the water #
# Let nothing come
between this and me #
# 'Cause everything I want #
# Is everything that's here #
#And when we're all together #
#There's nothing to fear #
# Ooh, ooh #
# Ooh, ooh, ooh #
# Ooh, ooh, ooh... #
#And wherever I wander #
#The one thing I've learned #
#Yeah #
# It's to here I will always #
#Always... #
# Return. #
Something new came
upon the land one night...
something that would
change my life forever...
and so, my journey began.
SPI RIT:
A wiser horse might have
turned and run
but I wanted to know
what strange creatures were here.
Oh!
What the...?
Son of a...!
Shh...
:
Look.
Man, look at that stallion!
It's beautiful!
Mmm, Sadie Mae.
Ugh!
Get him, boys!
Easy, boy!
C'mon, boys! Let's go!
C'mon, boys!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Where did he go?
I don't see him.
We'll find him!
What the...?
##
##
Faster!
What?
Get him!
Ha! Come on! Ha!
Ha! Get him!
Hyah! Yah! Yah!
Come on, come on, come on!
Ha-ha! We got him now!
Ha-ha, you betcha!
Whoa!
Look out!
Whoa!
Thought you got away,
didn't you, mustang?
Over here!
Get back here!
You crazy?
Get back from him!
Take him!
Take him, Joe!
Get the horse!
He's ours now. Whoo!
Hold him!
Watch him!
Watch the lines!
Watch the lines!
Come on!
He can do all the kicking
he wants now.
It won't do no good.
Careful... Careful...
SPI RIT:
I was scared, and I didn't know
what was going to happen to me
but at least my mother
and the herd were safe.
Come on! Let's go!
Yo... come on...
# Gotta fight another fight #
# I gotta run another night #
# Get it out, check it out #
# I'm on my way
and it don't feel right #
# I gotta get me back #
# I can't be beat, and that's a fact #
# It's okay, l'll find a way #
#Ain't gonna take me down, no way #
# No, oh, oh, oh #
#Yeah, don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it #
# Don't push me, l'll fight it #
# Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no #
# No, oh, oh, oh #
# If you can't catch a wave then
you're never gonna ride it #
#You can't come uninvited #
# Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no #
#You can't take me, I'm free #
#Why did it all go wrong? #
# I want to know what's going on #
#What's this holding me? #
# I'm not where I'm supposed to be #
# I gotta fight another fight #
# I gotta fight with all my might #
# I'm getting out, so check it out #
#You're in my way, yeah,
you better watch out... #
Open the gate!
# Come on! Don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it #
# Don't push me, l'll fight it #
# Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no #
# No, oh, oh, oh #
# If you can't catch a wave
then you're never gonna ride it #
#You can't come uninvited #
# Never gonna give in,
never gonna give it up, no #
#You can't take me, I'm free #
# I'm free. #
What seems to be the problem,
gentlemen?
We got us a crazy one here, sir.
Pure mustang, Colonel.
Really?
The Army has dealt
with wild horses before.
This one will be no different.
SOLDI ER:
Come on, mustang.
SPI RIT:
I remember the first time
I saw a rattler
curled up in my path.
Induct this animal, Sergeant.
Yes, sir!
SPI RIT:
This one didn't look like a rattler
but I was still thinking... snake.
SERGEANT:
Take up that slack.
Grab him! Grab him!
Come on, horse!
Okay, Murphy, he's all yours.
Whoa! He's a wild one.
We'll see how wild he is
when I'm done with him.
-
- See that?
You want to fight, do you?
Right.
Make sure that's good and tight.
- Murphy, look out!
- Watch out!
SERGEANT:
He's a wild one.
SERGEANT:
You all right, Murph?
Eh-heh... you...
SERGEANT:
Murph, you okay?
SERGEANT:
Um... Corporal, round up
some volunteers to, uh...
take this animal to the stables.
Not the stables.
SERGEANT:
Sir?
COLONEL:
The corral.
It's time to break that horse.
#Well, you think
that you can take me on #
#You must be crazy... #
OFFICER:
Make sure it's good and tight.
#There ain't a single thing
you've done #
#That's gonna faze me #
# Oh, but if you want to have a go #
# I just want to let you know #
#Yeah, get off of my back
and into my game #
# Get out of my way
'cause I'm wild and untamed #
# Get out of my face
or give it your best shot #
# I think it's time
you better face the fact #
# Get off of my back... #
Okay, my turn!
#You know it's all just a game #
#That I'm playin' #
# Don't think
that you can find a way in... #
Lousy heap of horse flesh!
#That's what I'm sayin'... #
Come on!
Run out of there!
# Oh, now, if you want to have a go #
# I just want to let you know #
# Oh, get off of my back #
#And into my game #
# Get out of my face,
'cause I'm wild and untamed #
# Get out of my way,
or give it your best shot... #
Hey, we got a rider!
# But you know
this train is comin' off this track #
# Get off of my back #
#Yeah, get off of my back #
# Get off #
:
#Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... #
# Get off, get off, get off, get off #
# Get off, get off, get off #
# Get off of my back. #
Sergeant!
Yes, sir.
Tie this horse to the post.
No food or water.
Three days.
Yes, sir.
##
SPI RIT:
My heart galloped
through the skies that night...
back to my herd,
where I belonged
and I wondered if they missed me
as much as I missed them.
SOLDI ER:
Get some water over to the stable.
Yes, sir.
SOLDI ER:
We caught a hostile!
SERGEANT:
Bring him back this way!
Well, what do we have here?
We caught him
by the supply wagons, sir.
Ah, a Lakota.
Not as tall as the Cheyenne;
not as fine-featured as the Crow.
Take him away, gentlemen.
Show him our best.
SERGEANT:
Corporal, take him to the stockades.
Not the stockades... the post.
No food or water.
CORPORAL:
Come on!
What are you looking at, boy?
SPI RIT:
He was called Little Creek
and he seemed different
from the rest.
Hey...
SPI RIT:
There was just no end
to the strange ways
of the Two-leggeds.
SERGEANT:
C Company! Ten-hut!
With the Colonel's permission, sir.
Incoming patrol reports
hostiles headed north.
COLONEL:
Ah.
The railroad has expressed concern, sir.
They've requested additional patrols.
How long has it been, Sergeant?
Sir?
The mustang,
how long has it been tied?
Three days, sir.
Good.
Fetch my crop and spurs.
You can break easy
or you can break hard, mustang!
No!
Back up! Back up!
Back up!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on... come on...!
Come on, mustang!
Ha!
You see, gentlemen...
any horse can be broken.
Move along, mustang.
There are those in Washington
who believe the West
will never be settled
the Northern Pacific Railroad
will never breach Nebraska...
a hostile Lakota...
will never submit to Providence...
and it is that manner
of small thinking
that would say this horse
could never be broken.
Discipline, time and patience...
are the three great levelers.
SPI RIT:
Sometimes a horse has gotta do
what a horse has gotta do.
Mustang?
SPI RIT:
And this was one of those times.
ALL:
Oh, no!
SERGEANT:
You all right, sir?
Get off me!
Soldier... secure that horse!
##
SPI RIT:
I wasn't sure what happened back there
and I wasn't about to stop and ask.
All I knew was
that I was headed home.
SPI RIT:
I couldn't believe it.
One moment I was free,
and the next... more ropes.
Steady. Steady.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Nice and easy.
There you go.
That feels better now, doesn't it?
Hey, hey!
SPI RIT:
I couldn't understand it.
She treated this scrawny
Two-legged like one of our kind
prancing around him
like a love-struck yearling.
It was downright unnatural.
Great mustang...
today I will ride you.
This ought to be good.
SPI RIT:
Mares!
Okay, Rain, let's see if you can
teach this mustang some manners.
SPI RIT:
Okay, I admit it, she was charming...
in a stubborn, irritating kind of way.
So, I let her show me her world.
Horsey!
Mmm... whoo!
Bye-bye, horsey.
For the first time in my life,
I felt my heart torn two ways.
Hey, hey...
No!
Give it back!
Come on!
Mustang, no! Mustang!
Oh, come on.
Oh...
Hmm?
SPI RIT:
I had to hand it to that boy...
he just wouldn't give up.
I'm never going to ride you, am I?
And no one ever should.
You can go.
It's okay, go.
Go on, get out of here!
Go home.
SPI RIT:
I knew this was hard for her
and that she was scared
but more than anything
I wanted to share
my homeland with her.
Ah!
##
SPI RIT:
I lay beside her that night, hoping...
praying that somehow
she would be okay.
MAN:
Hey! There's a couple
of horses over there.
SOLDI ER:
Hyah!
SOLDI ER 1:
Ha!
SOLDI ER 2:
Leave the mare.
She's not going to make it.
SOLDI ER:
Come on.
Come on!
Oh, Rain.
Oh...
Easy, girl.
Easy.
It'll be okay.
SOLDI ER:
Come on.
Hyah, hyah.
You saved my life.
Two more men on that brace!
Collins! Evans!
Bring it down!
Let's go!
Jackson, hey!
Grab ahold of that end!
Got it!
This one's loaded.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.
# Sound the bugle now #
# Play it just for me #
#As the seasons change #
# Remember how I used to be #
# Now I can't go on #
# I can't even start #
# I've got nothing left #
#Just an empty heart #
##
# I'm a soldier #
#Wounded,
so I must give up the fight #
#There's nothing more for me #
# Lead me away #
# Or leave me lying here #
##
# Sound the bugle now #
#Tell them I don't care #
#There's not a road I know #
#That leads to anywhere #
#Without a light,
I fear that I will stumble in the dark #
# Lay right down #
# Decide not to go on #
#Then from on high #
# Somewhere in the distance #
#There's a voice that calls #
# Remember who you are #
# If you lose yourself #
#Your courage soon will follow #
# So be strong tonight #
# Remember who you are #
#Yeah #
#You're a soldier now #
# Fighting in a battle #
#To be free once more #
#Yeah, that's worth fighting for. #
Come on.
Come on now.
It'll be all right.
Come on.
That's it. That's it.
MAN:
Let's go!
Come on!
SPI RIT:
I didn't know why
we were brought here.
What I did know was we had to find a way
to escape and get back home.
MAN:
Clear!
No good!
We hit bedrock!
Well, that's it.
We're hauling the steamer
over the mountain.
That's crazy.
We got six days
to connect with Utah.
We move out at dawn.
##
##
Ready to go!
Hyah!
Move it out!
Move it out!
##
Hyah!
Whoa!
Get back in line!
##
MAN :
We're almost at the top!
Slow down up front!
##
SPI RIT:
That was the moment
I understood.
They were headed to my homeland,
and I had to stop them.
Get back!
Come on! Get back in line!
It's starting to slip!
Whoa! Pick up the slack!
Pick up the slack!
Hold it!
Get the mules up here!
Secure it on the left!
Good work, boys!
Hey!
Whoa!
Easy...
Get him. Get him.
Whoa!
Hurry!
Bring the poles!
Hurry!
Hey, hold him there!
Go!
They're breaking!
I can't hold it!
Over here!
Get out of the way!
Holy...!
SPI RIT:
I don't know where he came from
or how he got there
but I sure was happy to see him.
##
Whoo-hoo!
Ah, ah!
Oh!
I knew I would find you.
MAN:
Halt!
I don't believe it.
Go, go, go, go! Run!
Run!
Come on, come on!
-
-
Whoo-hoo!
Hyah!
SOLDI ER:
Hyah!
Yeah!
Ah!
Whoa!
That's it!
Come on! Come on!
Get off!
Ooh! Aah!
Ooh!
Whoa!
SOLDI ER:
Hyah!
We got them now!
Whoa!
Where did he go?
There they are!
Up there!
Oh, no.
SPI RIT:
Oh, yes.
##
Hyah.
CHORUS:
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #
# Don't judge a thing
till you know what's inside it #
# Don't push me, l'll fight it #
# Never gonna give it,
never gonna give it up, no #
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #
#Ah, if you can't catch a wave #
#Then you're never gonna ride it #
# Can't come uninvited #
# Never gonna give it,
never gonna give it up, no #
#You can't take me #
# I'm free #
#Yeah, I'm free #
#Yeah... huh! #
#Yeah... huh! #
#Yeah... huh! #
#Yeah... huh! #
##
You will always be in my heart.
Take care of her
Spirit-Who-Could-Not-Be-Broken.
##
I will miss you, my friend.
##
SPI RIT:
I had been waiting so long to run free
but that good-bye
was harder than I ever imagined.
l'll never forget that boy...
and how we won back
our freedom together.
# I hear the wind #
# Call my name #
#The sound that leads me home again #
# It sparks up the fire #
#A flame that still burns #
#To you I will always return #
# I know the road is long #
# But where you are is home #
#Wherever you stay #
# l'll find the way #
# l'll run like the river #
# l'll follow the sun #
# l'll fly like an eagle #
#To where I belong #
# I can't stand the distance #
# I can't dream alone #
# I can't wait to see you #
#Yes, I'm on my way home #
# Now I know it's true #
# My every road leads to you #
#And in the hour of darkness #
#Your light gets me through #
#You run like the river #
#You shine like the sun #
#Yeah #
#You fly like an eagle #

BRYAN ADAMS:

ADAMS:
# I can't believe this moment's come #

#There's so much to be said and done #
# It's impossible not to be overcome #
#Will you forgive me
if I feel this way? #
# 'Cause we just met #
#Tell me that's okay #
ADAMS/SARAH McLACHLAN:
# So, take this feeling #
# Make it grow #
# Never let it #
# Never let it go #
McLACHLAN:
# Don't... let... go... #
#You give me something
