Good a spot as any.
Well, now I don't know.
You oughta move it up the street.
No. Right here.
The folks from the casino can watch.
All right. Let's get unloaded, boys.
This is a waste of time and money.
In the old days, we didn't build
scaffolds for hanging.
These ain't the old days.
Since Bill Jorden's been sheriff,
everything's gotta be legal.
A tree was good enough for my pappy
and I say it's good enough for me.
Go on and help unload.
I'll get this thing started.
Hello, Orv al.
No, I ain't got no drink.
I wasn't asking.
No, but you was hoping.
You're sure putting out
a lot of sweat for nothin'.
Sheriff Jorden says he hangs,
he hangs.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
I think
I'll sit around a while and sing.
The hanging ain't till sundown.
Got nothin' but time, Orv al.
Nothin' but time.
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall
# And I hate you, one and all
# Yes, I hate you, one and all
# Blast your hides
# Oh, I killed three men, they say
# Yes, I killed three men, they say
# So they say
# I filled them full of lead
# And I left them there for dead
# Yes, I left them there for dead
# Bless their hides
Howdy, Bill.
Morning, Hank, Joe.
Today's the day, huh?
No different than any other day.
Except for Sam Hall.
If you ask me, Sheriff, it ain't
only Sam Hall you should be hanging.
I didn't ask you.
He's right, Bill.
If your father was sheriff,
we'd hang whoever brought
that gun-crazy killer to Gunlock.
Mornin', Tom.
Today's the day, isn't it?
Yeah, today's the day.
I was going to the casino
to lay a bet later.
They're giving five to three
Hall don't hang.
Eight to three.
How would you bet
if you were a betting man?
Judge Webb wants Hall hanged
at sundown today.
That's when he'll hang.
If you say so, Sheriff.
Up kinda early, Bill.
Yeah.
Well, today's -
Don't say itl
Or I'll heave you out the window.
Well, it is the day.
I'll be mighty glad when it's over.
Did he give you any trouble?
Nah.
Just wanted to bet me
he'd be outta here before sundown.
How much?
$1,000 dollars.
As if I had itl
Sure be glad when that guy's hanged,
so I can go home
and get some sleep in a real bed.
Go get your breakfast.
Bill, what do you figure they'll do?
I wish I knew.
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure
Hall, are you sleeping?
Who can sleep
with all that hammering?
What do you want for breakfast?
Ever heard of Del Monico's, Sheriff?
No, I can't say that I have.
I'll ask at the restaurant.
Maybe they know how to cook it.
Del Monico's
is an eating place in Yoko.
Oh? Back East?
Let's say it's in a different world.
A world of crystal chandeliers,
Champagne...
soft music,
elegant ladies and fine furs.
Silks. Beautiful ladies, sheriff,
with soft, round, white arms.
Who are you? Where are you from?
I'm a bad boy from a good family.
Your real name's not Sam Hall.
I'm a rose by any name.
Shakespeare, Sheriff, William
Shakespeare. He was a writer.
Look, Hall, you're hanging today
for killing that Smith boy.
Why don't you clear up
those other two killings?
You're the sheriff.
You clear 'em up.
Somebody sent for you to come here.
Who was it?
You two-bit gunslingers
don't work for nothing.
Who paid you?
You annoy me, Sheriff.
When I leave your hotel, I'm gonna
Who paid you for those killings?
Was it the cattlemen?
George Ballard?
George Ballard?
Sheriff, what are you gonna do
if it's George Ballard?
You plan to hang him before
you marry his sister or after?
Hello, Ballard.
Lew, what's so urgent?
We've gotta change our plans.
You mean, we let Hall hang?
No. We can't save him
at the last minute.
But we step in
when he goes to the gallows.
The farmers heard
and want to beat us to it.
A lynching? They haven't the guts.
That schoolmaster has the fellas
so riled up they'll try anything.
Nothing we can do,
unless we wage war.
But we owe it to Hall.
I agree with Hogan.
We should save Hall's neck.
What he did, he did for us.
The three fellas he killed
were all north of the creek.
Jorden won't let us bust Hall out.
He'll give us trouble.
We'd better get moving. It'll take
hours to round up the cattlemen.
OK. Get as many men as you can
before mid-afternoon to meet here.
Haven't seen one cattleman
all morning.
Or one farmer.
Sure is quiet.
More like Sunday.
I remember being in a cyclone once.
Before she hit,
there was feeling of emptiness,
like the air
had been sucked out of space.
Got that same feeling.
Why wait for trouble?
Let's hang Hall now.
Uh-uh. Until sundown,
there's always a chance of reprieve.
- A fat chancel
- Maybe.
But hanging him early
would be just like lynching him.
Tom Jorden wasn't so finicky
when he was wearing that star.
Look, I'm sick and tired of hearing
what my father would've done.
I'm sheriff now
and I'll do it my way.
I was only making talk.
Looks like Hall has a visitor.
Well, I'm in no mood for hysterics.
Do what you can for her.
Wait a minute,
what if she starts acting up?
A handsome fella like you oughta
know how to handle the ladies.
# I saw Nellie dressed in blue
# Dressed in blue
# I saw Nellie in the street
# In saw Nellie dressed in blue
# She said
# 'Sam, now you'll be true.'
# Cos triflin' days are through
# Blast your hide #
Is the sheriff in?
No. He had to go out.
I wonder, would it be all right -?
Sure, Nellie.
Stay as long as you like.
Thanks.
Why the solemn face?
Look like you're going to a funeral.
Don't joke about it, Sam.
Honey, nobody's got a rope my size.
You've been saying that for days.
Now it's only a matter of hours.
Yeah, I know.
Sam...
Take these two letters. Hide them.
Then go and see
Gunlock's leading citizen.
George Ballard?
The man who retained me.
You said it was
the Cattlemen's Association.
It was.
The farmers didn't scare out.
An anonymous gentleman
made a deal with me.
'Since your reputation
will not frighten the farmers,
you will earn $1,000 for removing
each farmer settling north of the creek.
'To show you earned the money,
leave his hat over his face
and lay a rock on the hat.'
There's no signature
and it's printed.
How do you know it was Ballard?
The wretches around here would
be lucky of they could sign X.
This is written by an educated man
- fancy words, neat printing.
Why didn't you do something before?
Read this.
Smuggled in after I was arrested.
"You won't hang unless
you try to implicate somebody else."
Same printing, no signature,
money in the envelope.
That's Ballard all right.
Figures money buys anything.
He might also figure with me
out of the way, he'll be safe.
Let him know you'll give Jorden
the letters, Ballard will act. Fast.
If you could get out of here...
we could go to some faraway place
and start over.
If you don't hurry,
I've got a real faraway place to go.
What do you reckon Hall weighs?
Oh, I'd say about... 200.
Just about right.
Howdy, Dan.
Any stockmen in your place today?
Not one.
Any farmers?
No.
Real quiet, ain't it?
# Let 'em build my gallows high
# Build it high
# Let 'em build my gallows high
# Build it high
# Let 'em build it to the sky
# But it ain't my time to die
# No, it ain't my time to die
# Blast their hides
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too
# He came too
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too
# He came too
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too
# Just to check the trap for you
# When they drop your body through
# Poor Sam Hall #
# Poor Sam Hall #
She's all ready, sheriff.
She'll do all right.
I wish this hanging was over with.
I've had a funny feeling
all morning.
Usually when I build the gallows,
I have an audience.
Today, there ain't nobody,
except a few schoolkids.
Schoolkids?
What are you doing out of school?
Mr Rigdon told us we could go home.
Honest. We ain't playing rookie.
If you don't believe us, ask him.
I think maybe I'll do that.
Go and join Mack.
Tell him to give you a rifle.
Do I get a deputy's badge?
Maybe later.
Tell him I'm going
to talk to Rigdon.
Teaching something besides school,
Mr Rigdon.
Care to take lessons?
Tell me why
you shut the school today.
That's no business of the sheriff's.
It's my business if the farmers
are coming to cause trouble.
You know where they're meeting
and when they're coming. Tell me.
How would I know? I'm not a farmer.
You've been steaming 'em up.
What I've told them is for
their own good. They look up to me.
You figure with my father dead,
the farmers can get control.
You'll wind up running the town.
That's not a bad idea.
I have the education
and the ability.
I wasn't cut out to be an underpaid
schoolteacher all my life.
Everyone can't wind up
marrying money.
Stop worrying about the farmers
and do something
about the cattlemen.
They brought Sam Hall out here.
I'll tell you
like I've told others -
I don't need rumours,
I need evidence to take action.
Even against George Ballard?
Why is he any different?
Everyone knows he's paid you off.
That's a lie.
Oh, not with money.
With his sister.
Brave man, with a gun in your belt.
Mr Rigdon's getting
the heck beat out of him!
Well, get the sheriff.
The sheriff is doing itl
Tell me where they are.
Bill!
Now listen you.
This won't exactly
make us any friends.
I don't want to make friends,
I want to keep the peace.
You're sure doing it the hard way.
Five bucks? What's it for?
Fining myself
for disturbing the peacel
- I'm taking your horse.
- Where are you headed?
Gotta see Ballard.
I don't you kids will have
any school tomorrow either!
Bill!
What happened?
I was fighting the teacher.
- Bill, I wish you...
- It's all right, darlin'. Shh.
Is your brother around?
No. George rode off
early this morning.
I haven't seen him since.
Jess Ryman and Jiggs Larribee
are with him.
Bill...
something bad's going on.
George won't tell me,
but I've heard talk.
Tell me one thing, Bill,
is my brother involved?
I don't know.
But if I find out he is involved,
if I have to arrest him,
how would you feel?
I mean, about us getting married?
What if I find out
George is mixed up in it?
If I have to help my brother,
take sides against you,
how would you feel?
I don't know, till it happens.
Let's hope it never will.
Let's talk about something else.
I'm going to Denver
to get fitted for my trousseau.
Nellie Mason"s handy with a needle.
I couldn't go to Nellie, not now.
Why not?
You used her before the trial.
It was different then.
We all thought she was a nice girl.
Ellen, she's still a nice girl.
If anybody should be condemned,
it's her mother.
- Her mother?
- A hard, domineering woman.
She never let Nellie look at a man.
Then Sam Hall came to town.
She'll be more lonely than ever
after today.
I'll see her first thing next week.
I'd hate to be alone.
Are you sure Mr Ballard will be in?
He usually is.
But today's a special day, isn't it?
I'll see if he's at his home.
Suit yourself, Miss Mason.
Come in.
Nellie! This is a surprise.
I've got to see your brother
right away.
He's not home.
But I'm glad you dropped by.
I wanted to talk to you
about my trousseau.
You want me to make it?
Please, sit down, Nellie.
What's the matter, Miss Ballard?
Beginning to feel guilty?
I guess the women in town
have been pretty rude.
But Nellie, I don't feel that way.
I don't mean the women in town.
I'm talking about your brother.
You and the ranchers' wives.
Your men
are just as guilty as Sam Hall.
They brought him to Gunlock.
Nellie, Nellie, please.
Your brother offered to pay him
for killing farmers.
I don't believe it.
Try asking him when he comes in.
Ask me what, Nellie?
Good morning, Ellen.
Ask me what?
I have a message for you.
Those letters you sent Sam,
if he hangs,
I'll hand them to the sheriff.
Sorry, but I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about.
Not the faintest.
About your trousseau -
Poor girl.
Once a woman starts slipping -
What letters was she talking about?
I don't know. Maybe that gunslinger-
George.
George, don't lie to me.
It isn't as simple as that.
You can't just clear it up
with a word.
Since Father died, it was always
just you and me. Remember?
I'm trying, George.
Rigdon brought
the first colony of farmers.
They settled south of the creek
because the irrigation was good.
They weren't bothering anyone.
No, but more poured in and fenced
off all the good range land.
You were away. You didn't see it.
It would be OK
if they'd stay south of the creek.
When Tom Jorden died, Rigdon urged
them to move north, right up here.
And you brought in a killer.
Yeah. To frighten the farmers,
not to kill them.
- Nellie Mason was right!
- Now look, Ellen.
You're as guilty of murder
as Sam Hall.
We hang rustlers and horse thieves,
why shouldn't we shoot men
who steal our grass?
You're talking about the Smith boy.
Ben Smith's son, he's dead.
What are you going to do?
Side against your brother?
Those letters, did you send them?
No. Don't worry about who did.
Nellie won't show those letters
to Bill or anyone else.
Why not?
Because by tonight, she and Sam Hall
will be miles out of Gunlock.
The cattlemen will break Hall
out of jail soon.
That'll mean shooting.
George, what happens to Bill?
He won't get hurt
if he doesn't try to play sheriff.
Suppose I can get Sam Hall out of
jail before the cattlemen move in.
With how many dead?
None.
Provided you can get Bill
out of his office for a few minutes.
My brother's best advice -
cheat 'em first
and marry 'em afterwards.
You can't marry a dead man.
What time do you want him out?
Not all the way, Orv,
just loosen it.
That's it.
Now if we get any visitors,
this'll announce it.
Do I get my deputy's badge?
When they start pinning stars on
courthouse janitors, I turn mine in.
Easy, Mack.
Keep your eyes open -
I'm taking a look around.
If I had a deputy's badge, it'd
be better when the shootingstarts.
Orv al, you wouldn't know which end
of this to shoot through.
You'd better not figure me
for supper.
Lew, don't go.
Ballard and the men
are waiting for me.
This isn't our affair.
Our ranch isn't farm land.
But if the farmers come
our side of the creek,
they'll take over the whole range.
Sam Hall knew
the risk he was taking.
Oh, Lew, I love you.
If anything ever happened to you...
I don't know how
I ever got along without you, Nan.
Lew...
there's something
I never told you about Sam Hall.
Remember the first time
you brought Hall to the ranch?
The next morning, he waited
till you'd gone out on the range,
then he came back here alone.
What happened?
Nothing.
I had your Winchester.
I'm going out to save his neck.
I've given my word.
I'll kill him.
Lew isn't here.
It's you I want to see, Nan.
Go away, George.
Lew's heading for trouble.
The best thing you ever did was
to tell me you were tired of me.
I'm happy with Lew.
Lew's a fine man. And so
I don't want to see him hanged.
Sam Hall expects
to be broken out of jail today.
If he isn't,
he'll name the man who paid him.
All the cattlemen sent for him.
Lew personally
offered him blood money.
I don't believe you.
Unfortunately, he put it in writing.
Lew is scared about those letters.
I have a plan
to get Sam Hall out of Gunlock.
Nobody takes any risks
except Sam Hall.
I'm listening.
Sam Hall needs a gun.
Are you asking me to get it to him?
You'll have help.
You want him to shoot his way out,
kill Bill Jorden?
Hall may be killed.
Your husband would be in the clear.
Why did you come to me?
I discovered that a long time ago.
When we were much closer.
Get this to Hall.
I can't visit him.
They'd want to know why.
Nellie Mason can.
She'll be there by 3:30.
You just do as I say. Get that gun
to Hall without any trouble.
What'll it be, Sheriff,
a beer or a bet?
How are the odds now?
Eight to three Hall doesn't hang.
I'll take three dollars worth.
You're friendly with the ranchers.
I'm friendly with everybody.
That include me?
Don't know a thing, Sheriff,
not a thing.
Oh, Bill?
Hello, Pastor, Doc.
MacNamara told us
we might find you here.
So what can I do for you?
You realise the ranchers
are gonna try to break Hall out?
I'm betting against him.
The farmers aim to string him up.
Hall is a symbol in this fight.
The farmers feel if Hall escapes,
the ranchers will run them
out of the country.
Well, make your point.
We want you to ask the governor
to send a company of national guard.
Look, if you didn't think
I could handle this job,
you never should've
elected me sheriff.
What are you trying to prove, Bill?
And how much bloodshed
will it take to prove it?
Think it over.
Don't think too long, Bill.
It's almost two o'clock.
Get this off right away.
Sure, Sheriff, sure.
"Gilbert Wilkes, State Capital."
National guard?
Expecting real trouble, eh, Sheriff?
I heard a rumour -
I want you to send a message,
not give me one.
Something's wrong.
The line's been cut.
We can't wait
any longer for Ballard.
Jess Ryman and me'll drop
in on Bill Jorden.
While we're upstairs...
Relax, men. I've arranged
for Sam Hall's escape.
- I don't believe you, Ballard.
- Are you calling me a liar?
You were always
against helping Hall.
I'm still head
of the Cattlemen's Association.
All right. I'm listening.
Hall will be
on his way out of town in an hour.
What do you think, Lew?
Well, if he's on the level, it'd be
the best way out for all of us.
I'll ride into town and find out.
I promised Sam
I'd bring him some food.
I told her it was all right.
All right.
Just a minute.
It's beef stew and pie.
There's no gun,
if that's what you're looking for.
Just making sure it's tender.
He'll have to manage with a spoon.
There's one more thing, Nellie.
I'll have to round up a woman
someplace to search you.
You won't find a woman in town
who'd care to touch me.
Go ahead, Sheriff.
All right.
From this side of the bars.
I was hoping we could be alone.
Get to see Ballard?
Get to see Ballard?
Everything's all arranged.
At three o'clock, Nan Hogan will
be below that window with a gun.
So Ballard jumped?
Uh-huh. At three-thirty,
There'll be a horse
in the shed across the alley.
Head for Santa Fe.
- I'll join you there.
- Got enough money?
Before I leave, I'll have
enough money for both of us.
Nellie,
I haven't always been good to you.
But I'll make it up to you.
I'll take you place back East
you never even dreamed of.
Ah, the prisoner's last meal.
There's cattlemen in town today.
I'll look around,
see if they brought company.
Then maybe I'll go
and welcome Mr Ryman.
You're leaving? It might be a trick.
I'll be within gunshot.
Get out of the way, janitor.
You might get yourself hurt.
I know he's still in jail.
If he'd escaped, there'd be
plenty of hollering and I...
I want a little talk with you, Jess.
I just rode into town for a drink.
No crime there.
No.
I can't account
for their drinking habits.
What time are you expecting them?
I ain't expecting nobody.
And that includes you.
Go on, reach for it, Ryman.
Only take it out gently
and put it on the bar.
Do like I say.
You're getting too big
for your breeches, sonny.
What for?
So I'll have one less hot-head
to handle when the shooting starts.
You got nothing against him.
He pulled a gun on the law.
I can hold him until sundown.
Start moving, Jess.
Tell the boys what happened, Leo.
They'll tear that courthouse apart.
You're not as big as your old man.
Got another guest, Mack.
Where's Orv al?
I don't know what's worse -
man talking with his teeth flopping
around or without his teeth,
whistling like a tornado.
Brought you some company, Sam.
Your visitor didn't stay long.
I sent her home. She was
interfering with my praying.
Fine deputy you are.
Half the town could've walked in.
What do you want, Tom?
I got a letter for you.
Miss Ballard gave it to me.
Thanks.
Ellen's over at the hotel,
wants to see me.
Why didn't she come herself?
Good question, Mack. I'll ask her.
It's OK. When Leo tells the boys
what happened, they'll come.
What time is it?
Three twenty-five.
Getting worried about the farmers?
I'm not worried about anything now.
Where did you get the gun?
Fished it out of thin air
with a spoon.
"Jorden! MacNamara!
Come in here, quick!
"Jorden, MacNamara!
What's the matter with him?
He suddenly keeled over.
MacNamara, put the gun down.
Come on, open her up!
The keys are still on this side.
I can only hang once.
Come on, inside.
Up, up.
Face the bars.
You didn't have to do that, Hall!
Stay out of this.
You're not going anywhere.
What do you mean?
I came alone, I'll leave alone.
How much money have you got?
You can't do this
after what we did for you.
Money, Ryman. All the ranchers did
for me was keep me in chips.
Come on, come on.
Now turn around.
None of those farmers were north of
the creek till I carried 'em there.
Then why did you kill 'em?
$1,000 a hit on delivery.
Why, you dirty, rotten... Urgh!
What are you doing in town?
What are you doing in town?
Did he tell you how many there are?
He didn't say.
Or when they're coming in?
He just said he walked out on them.
They'll be coming into town now.
Oh, don't go, Bill, please.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
You had to make a choice
sooner than we expected.
I'm glad we're not
on opposite sides.
GUNSHOT
I'm never so glad
to see anyone in my life!
I was afraid
you didn't hear my gunshot.
You can sure have him.
I thought that janitor
was gonna blow my head off.
Can I take my hands down?
What happened to MacNamara?
How did you get him, Orv al?
I was pretty sore, MacNamara
kicking me out of the office.
So I kept watch downstairs -
showed that smart deputy
he wasn't so smart.
Good thing you did.
I heard that loose step squeak,
like somebody sneaking downstairs.
I figured it might be trouble.
Hall never knowed a thing till
my rifle jammed him in the back.
You did a fine job, Deputy.
I wanna see Mack's face.
I just wanna see his face.
Open the door.
Put him back in his cell, Deputy.
Come on, Hall.
Face the wall.
Mack, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
What happened to Ryman?
Just Hall's way
of saying thanks to a friend.
Put him in his cell, Orv.
I'll look after Ryman.
Get in, Hall.
That's a bad bump
you've got on your head there.
Bill Jorden locked up Jess Ryman.
Let's go.
Are you sure Sam got the gun?
I hope so.
Your train isn't due in
for a while yet.
I've got a stop to make first.
Sam and I need money.
George Ballard will provide it.
Don't count on it. He won't part
with a dollar without good reason.
I've got two good reasons
right here.
Two letters George Ballard wrote Sam
offering him money to kill farmers.
Ballard?
He told me my husband sent them.
Ellie, give me those letters.
I will not.
I want those letters.
Oh, no, you don't!
I can't fight any more.
Please, don't do it.
Lew and I will see
that you get to Santa Fe somehow.
But these letters
are going to Bill Jorden.
No signature.
How do I know Ballard wrote these?
One man's printing
is like another's.
I'd know them anywhere.
This is a little hard to say, Bill.
I guess you know
that at one time,
I expected to marry George Ballard.
He used to send me notes.
They were always printed.
That printing was exactly like
those letters he sent to Sam Hall.
I'm afraid
it won't stand up in court.
Bill...
if it wasn't George Ballard,
why would his sister get involved?
Ellen? Where does she fit in?
Think it over.
Why were you out of your office
at exactly 3i30?
MacNamara. Mack!
Ellen Ballard is at the hotel.
Bring her here.
Even if you have
to put her under arrest.
Well, what are you waiting for? I
So we wound up
on opposite sides after all.
No, Bill, it's -
I was convinced you'd decided to go
along with me, not your brother.
That was my decision, Bill.
I only got you out of here because
I was afraid you'd be hurt...
killed.
Killed?
You arranged to get a gun
into the hand of murderer!
Gun?
George never told me about a gun.
Did you think he would break out
with a sling shot?
He said if I got you out of here,
they"d handle Mack with no shooting.
And you believed it?
I was worried, Bill.
I was just thinking about you.
About me? Or your brother?
They're coming into town, Sheriff.
Where are they?
Two miles out on the south road.
The cattlemen would move in
from north of the creek.
The cattlemen?
It's Rigdon and his gang.
Thanks for letting me know.
Any time, Sheriff.
I don't hold with lynchings.
And if you don't hold
with jailbreaks,
watch the north road
for the cattlemen.
Mack! Orv al!
Rigdon and co are coming.
I'm off to meet 'em.
They won't be willing to talk.
Once they get into town, we'll never
get 'em out. Folks'll get hurt.
Don't go. You'll be killedl
What do we do with her? Lock her up?
You can let her go.
I'm through with her.
Don't try to stop us, Jorden.
We're going after Hall.
Let me remind you, Ben,
and the rest of you farmers,
the courthouse stairs are narrow.
Two men at the top
could kill you all.
I got two men there right now.
Only two?
Nobody takes Hall away without
killing me and my two deputies.
He's trying to keep us here
while the ranchers get Hall out.
Hold it.
We're not criminals.
All we want is justice.
I know how I'd feel
if my boy had been murdered.
Hall was sentenced to hang
at sundown today. Let the law do it.
Don't make yourselves murderers,
as bad as he is.
All right, Sheriff,
I'll go along with you.
Are you forgetting
your son was murdered?
I ain't forgetting nothing.
As long as Ben Smith goes along,
that's good enough for me.
You'll need help,
if the ranchers try to get Hall out.
How about deputising us?
I can't, Ben.
For years, my father walked a narrow
road between you and the cattlemen.
He headed off open warfare
by not taking sides.
I won't either.
One itchy trigger finger
could destroy everything.
So I'm asking you to stay out
All right, Bill.
Don't be in a hurry to break up.
I suggest you men wait
at the stock yard, just in case.
We'll wait at the stock yard.
Thanks.
What about the farmers?
We've only got the cattlemen
to worry about.
Only the cattlemen?
How's Ryman?
Dr Quinn said he'll be all right,
but he's still out cold.
Where's Ellen Ballard?
Back at the hotel, I guess.
Where will you be?
I have unfinished business
at the bank.
If you're listening for shooting,
don't.
Hall didn't make it.
Didn't make what?
What are you talking about?
The gun you gave Nan Hogan.
You're not making sense, Bill -
She showed me
the letters you sent to Hall.
Letters?
Your personal invitation to Hall
to commit murder.
You're talking, Bill,
but can you prove it?
Folks say that Ballard blood had run
thin by the third generation.
I didn't believe it.
Till today.
Go ahead, George, reach for it.
No, that's not your way, is it?
You hire others
to do your dirty work.
Go on, George, reach.
You've been wanting me dead.
Now's your chance.
What kind of talk is that, Bill?
I wasn't keen
on you marrying Ellen -
After Hall hangs, I won't rest till
I get whoever sent those letters.
Then get him.
You can't prove I sent them.
I know.
That's why I want your confession.
Now, in writing!
See if you can find
some paper down there.
Let's get on with it.
Bill?
Lew Hogan's coming in
with the ranchers.
They're just outside town
on the north road.
Don't do that again, Boss.
Busting in on us like that.
When the trouble starts, we'll cover
the window. Mack, the stairs.
Lew, don't do it! Please, listen!
Get in off the street, Mrs Hogan.
You'll safe in the hotel.
Jorden, we don't want any trouble.
We're here to get Sam Hall.
You got five minutes
to take it over, sheriff.
If Hall don't come out,
we're coming in.
You men, fiind yourselves some cover.
# Sam Hall
# That's the name they will recall
# Sam Hall
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# My name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall...
Better stay by the stairs.
# Yes, I hate you, one and all
# Blast your hides
# Oh, I killed three men, they say
# So they say
# Yes, I killed three men, they say
# So they say
# I filled 'em full of lead
# And I left 'em there for dead
# Blast their hides #
Don't worry, Miss Ballard,
your brother won't get hurt.
Whatever happens,
George won't get hurt.
I'm sorry.
I guess we all do what we have to.
Anyway, when you...
when you chose your brother's side
over Bill Jorden's,
you sure saved yourself
a lot of heartache.
Why do you say that?
Bill Jorden's a dead man.
Whoever wins, he's dead. He knows
your brother sent those letters.
My brother?
You don't know George very well,
do you?
Bill Jorden won't live long enough
to bring him to trial.
What's the matter, George?
No more killers to hire?
Go home, Ellen.
Gimme that gunl
Jorden, your time's up!
I never shot a man before.
Mack!
Orv?
I guess I didn't move fast enough.
Don't go doing anything foolish,
Orv.
I wouldn't know what to do
without you around.
Who would I talk to?
Always knowed you were soft inside.
Sorry, Orv. I never should've
let you in on this.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
He's passed out.
Mack, get Hall out here. Quick!
This man was sentenced
to hang at sundown.
I aim to carry out that sentence.
If you cattlemen think
you can save him, you're wrong.
Keep me covered.
# Oh, the parson
He was there, he was there
# Yes, the parson
He was there, he was there
# Oh, the parson, he was there
# With the Bible and a prayer
# But he knew
I didn't dare blast his hide
# Oh, the sheriff
He came too, he came too
# Yes, the sheriff, he came... #
Oh, sheriff,
we're both sticklers for the law.
So?
So the law says
a prisoner's hands must be tied.
I'll do it, sheriff.
Tell him what you told me.
We owe Hall nothing. None of the men
he killed were north of the creek.
He made a deal with the sheriff.
Does that nut look like I'm lying?
Hall did it, after he told me he
killed those men south of the creek.
No.
There's a lot of squaring to do,
That'll be up to the governor.
# Now it's up the rope I go
# Up I go
# Yes, it's up the rope I go
# Up I go
# Oh, it's up the rope I go... #
Anything you care to say, Hall?
Saml Saml
Tell the holier-than-thous
in this town
not to blame Nellie Mason
for what I did.
Save it.
I thought you were
such a stickler for the law.
Oh, I am.
But the sun's setting for me.
It'd be a shame
to miss a minute of it.
He's dead, Sheriff.
Look after Hall, Mack.
There's nothing you can do for him.
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall
# It is Sam Hall
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall
# And I hate you, one and all
# Yes, I hate you one and all
# Blast your hides...
# To heaven, I won't go, I won't go
# To heaven, I won't go
# But there's one thing that I know
# I will meet you all below
# Blast your hides
# Sam Hall
# Sam Hall
# That's the name they will recall
# Sam Hall #
