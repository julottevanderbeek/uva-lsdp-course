Nebraska Territory,
circa 1853.
Come on, girls.
- Hello, Bob.
- Afternoon, Miss Cuddy.
Come on inside, I've got supper ready.
The pie is made out of peaches... from a can.
They had four of those cans.
I don't know who got the other three,
- I don't know who could afford 'em.
- It's good pie.
If it pleases you, we might
have a postprandial recital.
Okay, what?
- A bit of music.
- I like music.
On the distant prairie,
where the heather wild,
In its quiet beauty liv'd and smiled,
little cottage,
and a creeping vine,
Loves around its porch to twine.
In that peaceful dwelling
was a lovely child,
With her blue eyes
beaming soft and mild.
And the wavy ringlets
of her flaxen hair,
Floating in the summer air.
Fair as a lily, joyous and free,
Light of that prairie home was she.
Ev'ryone who knew her felt the gentle pow'r
Of Rosalie, "The Prairie Flower."
That sure was pretty singin', Miss Cuddy.
- I got some cheese.
- Cheese?
Yes, Ma'am, you know I've got
a few of your sheep now.
I know.
Well, I made some cheese outta their milk.
I wonder if you'd like to have some.
I've got some here in my pocket.
The cheese would be a fine finish to our
fried chicken dinner and
peach pie this evening.
Well then, here it is.
This is fine cheese, Bob.
So why not marry?
Do what?
land, animals, implement, lives,
the whole ball of wax?
know-how to improve your claim and mine.
And if the union produces children,
so much the better.
Looked at from any angle, it works.
So why not marry?
I reckon I'll go back
East to find me a wife.
Please, Mr. Giffen,
I won't take "No." for an answer.
Miss Cuddy...
I appreciate the offer and the supper,
and the concert and all...
but I cannot marry you.
Will not.
Won't.
I ain't perfect,
but you are too bossy.
And too plum-damned plain.
There ain't no medicine for it.
This one here's still
breathing a little bit, Mama.
She is dead.
Mother is dead!
= Mor er død! =
I'll take her outside.
No! No! We must bury her properly!
I'll prepare her.
I'll take her outside
She is starting to smell.
No! No! No!
We must bury her properly!
You wished for her to die.
= Du ønskede for hende at dø. =
You hated her.
= Du hadede hende. =
You hate me.
= Du hader mig. =
Take her inside!
Let Go!
Take her inside!
Let Go!
Take her inside!
Ice...
Cold...
FROZEN!
Oh, my Jesus.
To what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend?
Springtime, Miss Cuddy.
Are Clydene and the kids
getting along all right?
Meaner than ever and
growing by the minute.
Put your mule up and
come on inside the house.
There's been some trouble amongst
the women here abouts.
I've heard about it.
It's bad.
Guess what I'm ordering.
- I couldn't.
- A Melodeon.
- You are not!
- Yep, I don't trust shipping a piano...
so, soon as I get into Loup I'm gonna
order a Mason & Hamlin Melodeon.
You'll have the only Melodeon in the Territory.
Back home I used to play
the piano by the hour.
I can't live without
real music much longer.
- I could help you with them dishes.
- I don't want any help with the dishes.
So...
How you gettin'
along with that Giffen boy?
He uses my mules when I don't need them.
He helps me with my corn.
We planted some potatoes together
and we keep the fences up.
How you getting along?
When my bulls have finished their work here,
I let him turn it turn up on his heifers.
Well...
Seems like you are getting
along together all right.
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
Feed him a meal every now and then.
Like you do me.
You're a good citizen, Mary Bee.
The bed up on the
loft has fresh linen.
I'll take the slop out to the hogs
before you go to sleep.
You're gonna give me a son.
You're gonna give me a son.
Hell no!
This here is a God damned free country, Dowd!
Can't nobody make me do it.
Thou shalt not take the Lord's
name in vain, Vester.
- Especially not in His own house.
- I won't go, I can't.
Why not?
In the name of our Savior, Vester.
I ask you, why not?
I can't take no time away from my crops
and I got the girls to look after
and I can't afford to pay for no wagon.
- I ain't in on this deal.
- Then what are we gonna do about Theoline?
Pitch her down a hole in the outhouse.
You are a poor specimen of a man,
Vester Belknap!
- I came here for the drawing.
- Me, too.
Let's get it over with.
I'll draw for Vester.
- What do you mean?
- I said I will draw for him.
- What did she say?
- I said, "I will draw for Vester Belknap."
Can we proceed?
This is a painful occasion for you and
your families and I grieve for you.
Your wives are fine and godly women.
But life gave them more
than they could bear.
Now we all draw lots.
Whoever draws the black bean
will carry the women home
to where they come from.
Shall we defer the lady?
- I'll draw last.
- I'll go first.
Keep your hands closed until
everybody's drawn.
Thor.
Miss Cuddy.
Put your hands in a circle here.
On the count of 3... 1...
- If that bean in my hand is black. I dunno...
- 2...
- Pass for it.
- 3.
Vester has to go?
But he said he wouldn't.
He has to, he's one of us.
I baptized him.
- I don't trust Vester.
- Me neither.
It's true, Reverend,
Vester is a brute with no conscience.
- I'll go.
- You can't.
- Yes I will.
- Well, hell, a woman?
I can ride as well as anybody.
And handle a team and shoot.
You all know that.
And I can cook and care for
those women better
than any of you can.
Hell, she's right,
she's sure as hell right!
That's mighty kind of you, Miss Cuddy.
you need,
we'll... we'll see to it.
- When will you leave?
- As soon as I can.
Today is May 5th.
She could be back in time to
celebrate 4th of July with us.
Reverend Dowd, we cannot allow this.
It is not a lone woman's place
to drive a wagon across this country.
Much less when it carries three of
the Lord's least capable children.
Then why not go with me, Mrs. Linens,
we can do it together.
You too, Mrs. Polhemus,
better still.
No, you have husbands and family
to care for, as you should.
But I do not, because I live uncommonly alone.
Enough, please, be seated.
I'm afraid you are all are
right about Mr. Belknap,
he's untrustworthy with the
task of this gravity,
and we need a Homesman.
We will do everything we can to equip and...
accommodate for this journey, Miss Cuddy.
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.
- Come to look after your wagon?
- I did.
- My Lord, what is that?
- It's a train wagon, traded for it last year.
Since then it's been sittin'
out here in the snow.
When Svendsen and Sours come
around here wantin' a wagon,
I gave 'em a hell of a deal on it...
I give it to 'em.
I cut the windows a little bigger,
greased it real good,
set some new spokes and fellows.
That's the just the right
thing for them women.
I put a sliding bolt on that door.
- What for?
- Lock them ladies in.
- Why would I do that?
- Stop and think about it.
Oh.
What's that?
You might wanna tie somethin' down.
Puttin' in ten of 'em.
Oh my, I'm not sure I'm ready.
Are you scared?
- A little.
- Listen here, Mary Bee...
You got a passable rig, mules,
and you're as good a man
as any man here abouts.
And you're doing a hell of a fine thing.
So go ahead on... get to it... and do it.
- Does everybody know?
- Yep.
- What are they say?
- Don't say nothin'.
People like to talk death and taxes.
they stay hushed up.
Miss Cuddy!
Mary Bee!
Mary Bee!
Whoa!
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.
I tried to catch you in town,
but you was already gone.
What do you want, Reverend?
To give you these,
they're letters to the women's
closest to kin around Hebron,
Iowa and on back East.
Your journey will be long,
difficult and dangerous.
I expect it will.
Well, bless you woman.
Bless you and keep you, you know I believe
in you, don't you, I truly do?
I know it.
I'd go in your place if I could.
Now let us pray.
Heavenly Father, look down upon my daughter.
Bless her in this undertaking.
Grant her thy strength,
guide her with thy grace that
she may carry home
these poor souls.
We beg of Thee.
In the name of Jesus Christ,
thy only begotten son
who gave his life
for the sins of man.
Amen.
Come on out outta there you
claim-jumpin' sonofabitch.
Come down in here and you'll be a sad bastard
as long as you live and that won't be very long.
But this here is Bob Giffen's place.
Bob Giffen has gone and abandoned this place,
and I have a filed a new claim with...
Go on, get the hell off of my roof, or face
stiffle recourse, God damn it, I got lawyers.
We need to hang that son of a bitch!
C'mon!
- Are you are an angel?
- You're not dead.
Help me.
Would you help me?
- For God sake?
- Suppose I do?
What would you do for me?
Anything! Anything!
As God is my witness!
If I cut you down, will you
do what I tell you to?
Hell, yes I will!
Swear to God!
- You swear to it?
- I swear.
Swear to that Almighty God
you've been talkin' about?
Vengeance is Mine,
sayeth the Lord, and
bringin' in sheaves, and...
do unto others, and...
if you cut me down from
this God damned tree,
I'll do anything you tell me to,
I swear on God's holy name.
Please.
All right, I'll save you.
I got a job'll work for you.
But if you try and hurt me or you
try and run away... I'll kill you.
Take off the noose.
I need to collect my possibles.
- This is Bob Giffen's place.
- I never met him.
- What happened to his sheep?
- I ate 'em.
Now you've been blasted out by vigilantes
and hanged for jumping Bob's claim.
Hell! That's abandoned.
Now look at it.
He didn't abandon nothing.
He just went back East, to find himself a wife.
It's abandoned.
It sure is.
This is abandoned.
Damn.
Unhitch and stable the mules
then tend to my mare, Dorothy,
and see to it that all the stock
on the place is fed and watered.
Your horse needs feed, too.
Well, if you don't care to, I will,
and then your supper'll be an hour late!
Get up that wagon!
Get up here now! C'mon!
Step up!
C'mon!
Get on there!
Cleanup before you come in.
What's this job of work you have in mind?
I would be grateful if you not
use my good chair that way.
My name is Cuddy,
Mary Bee Cuddy.
- Where is Mr. Cuddy?
- I'm unmarried.
What's the job?
Three women in this country
have lost their mind...
their husbands can't care for them properly.
You and I are gonna take them
back across the river to Iowa.
- The Missouri River?
- We'll leave tomorrow.
Hell, that's five God damn weeks from here!
I will not sit still for
profanity in my house.
I can see why you're single!
I need someone who can hunt
and guide and spell me at the rains,
help with the animals on the trip.
That's why I set you free.
It's your job and you're sworn to do it.
Three crazy women for five weeks
is a lot more than I bargained for.
If you've lied to me, and intend
on abandoning your responsibility,
then you are a man of low character,
more, disgusting pig than honorable man.
Thank you for the kind words, Sister.
You're no prize yourself, you're plain
as an old tin pail and you are bossy!
But I'll sit out with you,
because I said I would.
And I'll help you tend your cuckoo-cuckoo
clocks as long as it suits me.
leave
when, where and if I please.
Now, if you don't mind me asking you,
where the hell is my God damned bed?
In the stable, where you belong.
What are you doing, Mother?
= Hvad laver du, Mor? =
I'm sweeping.
= Jeg feje. =
You see I'm sweeping.
Why?
= Hvorfor =
Why are you sweeping?
= Hvorfor feje du? =
God is in our house.
= Gud er i vores hus. =
Our house was always clean.
Mom, you've lost your mind.
Soil is made of dust.
You'll dust off the dust?
This house will be clean.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

The wind's blown all the corn over.
I know it.
All we can do is burn
the cobs in the stove.
There ain't no corn for us to eat.
Just cobs... just bare old cobs.
- I know it.
- The wheat and goats are dead.
I know that.
What do you know?
Are you crazy?
Pull up here. Whoa.
- You better lock me in the wagon.
- Why?
Well, I cheated one rope I
don't wanna change to another.
- Them sons of bitches'll try to hang me again.
- Oh, you might be recognized.
- You got any money?
- Some. Why?
I need 3 boxes of paper cartridges
for a Navy Colt's 36 and a jug of whiskey.
- Bullets maybe, but no whiskey.
- Why not?
Can't have you gettin' drunk around
poor, defenseless women... no.
Well, then, I won't go East with you!
Goodbye, Cuddy!
- That's my business.
I'm going to the bank
and I need your name.
Oh, well, we'll say "George".
George what?
- Briggs.
Briggs.
That's right,
George Briggs, George Briggs.
Read this.
Here, I'll read it for you.
Mr. George Briggs, care of Mrs. Altha Carter,
Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa.
So?
I put banknotes for $300 inside
this envelope, just for you.
Well, why not let me have it now?
Right this minute I'm going to the
Post Office to put it in the mail.
Why not carry it along with us?
Mrs. Carter
will have it for you.
Her boy's not very not old,
we'll have to watch him close.
I don't know what he'll do
when we take Arabella away.
Ma'am...
Well there she is, my wife, Belle.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Sours.
She won't say nothin', Miss Cuddy,
she just sets and looks out the window.
It's like her body's all stoved-up.
I have to carry her to the outhouse,
undress her nights, dress her in the morning.
How long she been like this?
Ever since...
I don't even know her no more.
How old is your wife?
Nineteen.
- And you?
- Twenty one
I see.
My, but she was beautiful, Miss Cuddy.
She may be once again.
Mr. Briggs, will ya winter-up your
leisure long enough to lend a hand? Now!
I wish you God's comfort, Garn.
Here... there's this, too.
Her grandma's wedding gift,
I reckon it should go with her.
I'll keep it for her and
see she takes it home.
We'll be back in a few weeks, you'll hear from
or meet the Reverend Dowd that she's safe.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
You don't love me?
You won't even look at me.
You don't give a tinker's damn.
Just go on home and play
with that damn doll.
Leave me up against it.
You don't love me?
- G'bye.
- Go on, get, you can just go to hell.
G'bye!
You don't love me.
Good morning, Mr. Svendsen.
Come in.
- She's ready.
- Why is she tied?
"God will strike you down",
she says to me.
She thinks she's God.
Her cousin will pick her up in Iowa
and take her to asylum.
Stop it!
What a pain you are!
= ...du der. =
How will we get her loaded?
Unbolt the wagon door.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop.
Open the wagon door!
Help me, push her in.
Do not untie her,
she'll try to kill you.
She'll try to kill her, too.
Drop out!
What are you doing with that son of a bitch?
- Oh, no.
- He's going with us.
He's the one who tried to
take over Bob Giffen's place.
I need help,
surely you understand!
He was suppose to hang.
- Mr. Svendsen.
- Get down off that wagon.
Get down off that wagon right now,
or I will shoot you where you sit.
I can't do this alone,
I need him, now you leave us be!
Get us moving.
You boys didn't have balls to hang me!
You wanted my horse to do it for you, didn't ya?
C'mon! Let's go.
C'mon, first, c'mon.
Keep that gun on that son of a bitch.
I'll watch over your wife, Mr. Svendsen,
I promise, she'll be safe with me.
I'm giving you my seed.
But you refuse.
You'll receive my seed, woman.
You'll give birth to our child.
You girls go to your room
while I talk to your mama.
Theoline, this is Mary Bee.
- Undo!
- Undo your hands? I am.
Undo, undo.
Undo, undo, undo.
Do you know me, Theoline?
Undo, undo, undo.
Line, darling,
I am Mary Bee, your friend.
Don't you know me?
Now listen, girls,
your mother's very sick.
But she loves you just the
same as she always has.
And you must love her, too, and
help as much as you can.
There are some things
I want you to do for her.
I want you to undress her,
heat some water,
and give her a nice bath,
with soap, from face to feet.
- Right on the bed?
- Right on the bed.
Wash and dry her hair, too,
then brush and comb it.
Then find some clean clothes for her
and underwear, and dress her again.
And while you do all this, I want you
to smile at her and say kind things.
- Do you know a little song you can sing?
- We know "Flow gently, Sweet Afton"
That would be fine.
And when you've finished all this, I want
you to do some chores for your father, too.
You're now the ladies of the house.
I want you to sweep it out,
wash the dirty dishes,
take the bedding outdoors and air it...
show him how grown up you are.
Will you do that for him, for me?
Now, all right, now start singing.
Flow gently, sweet Afton
- Good, and remember...
-  Among thy green braes
- love your dear mother.
-  Flow gently, I'll sing thee
- Now, you get busy as bees, give me these foreheads.
-  a song in thy praise
Flow gently, I'll sing thee
a song in thy praise
My Mary's asleep by
thy murmuring stream.
Flow gently, sweet Afton,
disturb not her dream.
Thou stock-dove whose echo
resounds tho' the glen
Ye wild whistling
blackbirds in yon thorny den,
Thou green-crested lapwing...
Mrs. Svendsen, is that you?
Please, stop wailing, Mrs. Svendsen.
Mrs. Svendsen, I asked you to stop.
Please do!
Stop!
Mrs. Svendsen, stop!
Do you think these mules'll make it
all the way to the Missouri river?
I doubt it, not without a good feeding of corn.
The one flickin' her ears, she knows
she's the subject of our discussion.
She's a thinker,
the other one's a worker.
They should have names,
what should we name 'em?
Mules don't need names, they need feed,
and corn's the best there is.
I'll name that one Grace,
and that one Redemption.
My mare, her name's Dorothy, after my sister.
She's married to a doctor up in New York state,
that's where we're from.
Dorothy has a little 6 year
old boy and a baby on the way.
Our mother died when we were little girls.
What's your horse's name?
Brown.
You didn't give me the two damned skinny
blankets, it gets cold at night out here!
You noticed.
We need to head south-east,
follow the river bottoms.
No.
We'll meet more people that way
in case we need help.
Ya know, only three kinds of people out here,
you gonna meet wagon trains that
don't want to see crazy people.
You gonna meet freighters
who will surely rape you,
and you gonna meet Indians
who'll kill ya... and then rape you...
after they kill me!
No, we're gonna go straight east to the river.
We're haulin' an odd lot of freight.
They are not freight,
they are human beings.
- They're crazy.
- They are precious to the Lord.
Precious to me, too.
Give me that skillet, about $300 worth.
Wake up! Time to get moving!
Get up and go pee!
C'mon there, girl.
Watch your head on the
hub there, baby, c'mon.
C'mon.
There ya go.
Pee.
God damn!
Squat down.
Squat down!
Now pee!
God... will strike you down.
God will strike you down.
I love trees.
I don't get to see very many trees...
I miss them.
God will strike you...
New York... has lots of trees.
Surely you wouldn't defile and desecrate.
You are horrible... and morbid!
I don't wanna be cold anymore
when I'm trying to sleep.
I need this buffalo hide,
and that dead Indian don't.
I was in the Dragoons.
Company C,
Fort Kearney.
Had us a right smart scuffle one time down
there in Kansas with them God damned Kiowas!
- Tell me.
- We were headed out to Fort Leavenworth.
Supply train, 6 mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses.
And we had Kiowas like flees trailing us!
War paint, sassy,
big as life and twice as natural.
- Wanted them horses.
- I see.
Well, we camped down on the
Arkansas River one night,
and them teamsters picketed 36 mules and
they picketed 300 horses in the sand.
Sand, hell, them picket pens wouldn't
hold a prairie dog in that sand.
Sure enough, that night,
Kiowas come through there
and stampeded the whole
bunch and away they went.
Trampled the wagons all to pieces,
got the stock all tangled up in the ropes,
and crippled-up with the flying picket fence,
and them Kiowas just running through
there hooping and hollerin'.
My, oh, my, wasn't we riled?
We blew the bugle... boots and saddles and
away went after 'em with the sun risin'.
We caught Kiowas here and we caught Kiowas there,
and we caught 'em in bunches and
killed every one of 'em.
We rounded up our stock and
drove it right through the
middle of the God damned
Kiowa camp... tore it all to hell.
Pretty fair job of work...
Company C 1st U.S. Dragoon!
Well, how interesting.
I don't want none o' your weevily wheat,
I don't want none o' your barley.
I'll take some flour and half an hour
and bake a cake for Charley.
The higher up the cherry tree,
The sweeter grows the cherry.
The more you hug and kiss a gal
The more she'll want to marry.
Charlie, he's a fine young boy
Charlie, he's a dandy.
Every time he goes town
He'll bring the gal some candy.
- What are they?
- Pawnee, probably.
- What was that?
- Bugle.
Somewhere along the line they
killed themselves a U.S. cavalry bugler.
- What do they want?
- Whatever we got.
The trouble is they don't know what that is...
they've never seen a wagon like this.
soldiers,
anything to them, hell, they don't know.
I count four rifles amongst 'em.
If they think we're worth
the trouble, we're dead.
I'll try to buy 'em off.
come all the way down here,
don't you fool with that carbine.
You get in the wagon quick as you can,
you shoot the women in the
head, then shoot yourself.
You got four good rounds.
C'mon, turn around here.
C'mon, turn around here.
Get outta here!
- What will they do with Dorothy?
- They'll probably eat her.
No! No!
What the hell?
Mr. Briggs, she's gone.
She's gone, we have to get her back!
- Cuddy, it was a God dammed horse.
- Get up, you lout.
She hasn't taken a step by herself
since we put her on the wagon.
Hells Bells.
That gal done run off.
- Morning!
- Morning!
Where you from, friend?
Freight train,
camped down south a little ways.
- Big, eh?
- Thirty wagons, six yolk.
Two weeks ago outta Fall City
headed for Salt Lake.
- You the driver?
- I am, out hunting' meat, you seen any?
No not today, I'm out looking
for this young lady here.
- She's lost.
- She ain't now.
Friend, I got a frame wagon back there,
I'm carrying three crazy
women to a church in Iowa
so they can go home back East.
This young girl is one of 'em.
She's married, her name is Sours.
She had three little children,
and lost 'em all
to the diphtheria... in short order
and she lost her mind.
She run away from us last night.
- I'm her friend.
- So am I.
So you wouldn't wanna
her not to waste you here.
She can spread her legs, can't she?
I can tell you what,
why don't we leave it to her.
See here sweet thing,
who'd you rather go with, him or me?
Well, there you be, she caught
me stunned me already.
- Friend, I'm taking this girl home.
- Not likely, she's mine now.
Possession is nine points of the law,
and it's all of us out here now, ain't it?
- Sorry, I'll just have to have her.
- God Almighty!
Fight you for her.
Best man takes the prize, how's that?
- I'm agreeable.
- All right.
When I say "Pitch",
we pitch these guns, how's that?
Anytime.
Pitch!
God Almighty!
- Say it again and act right this time.
- Pitch!
Goodbye.
Did you have to take an eternity?
She's nearly froze to death.
You lost one horse, Cuddy,
here's you another one.
- Who did you get this horse?
- Man let us have him.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he was dead, Mrs. Sours shot him.
- Indians... for the clothes.
Wolves.
"Cissy Hahn, eleven years, two months, nine days."
"God loved her and took her home onto Him."
Let's go, Cuddy.
I intend to tidy up this grave.
-
- I don't care.
Well, suit yourself, I'm goin' home.
Then, I'll take a horse
and join you later.
Not mine you won't.
You'll have to ride that train horse.
I want a shovel, too.
Oh, Sweet Merciful Father,
Prince Jesus,
Good Shepherd,
Harvester of righteousnesses,
take thee this token
and bury them deep,
carry in...carry in,
in love let us sleep.
Send me summons to wed Thee one day.
Love us, and love me, Oh, love me, I pray.
Amen.
Why, why, why did you
light a fire for me?
What about supper?
I did light a fire for you, Cuddy.
Where's that shovel?
I lost the goddamn shovel!
Who cares about a shovel?
- You... are... insane!
- The hell I am, Cuddy.
I'm tryin' to move a load to the river
quick as I can and draw that $300.
And that's all there is!
There ain't no more.
If I should prosper,
Hear my heart pray, .
Send me a summons to wed thee one day.
Take me this token and love me all ways.
But if I should perish, Thy promises keep.
Take thee our two hearts and bury them here.
Take Thee our tokens and love let us sleep.
- I couldn't sleep.
- I could.
How long now 'til we get there?
A week... thereabouts, maybe a month, hell, I don't know.
It's almost over now. We stay in
Iowa or come back to the territory?
I don't know.
- You're not much for makin' plans.
- No, not much.
Mr. Briggs, you're an intelligent man.
And if you think on it,
I'm sure you will see the wisdom in it.
After we've turned
them over to Mrs. Carter,
why don't we marry and
come back together?
I'm 31 years old, if I'm
ever to marry, it better be soon, and
you're not getting any younger.
You've seen my house and my stock.
I've got two fine claims
and money in the bank...
I'm in good health and
capable of child bearing...
I plan to buy shoats next spring
and fatten 'em on corn...
and come summer I'll
have 60 acres into wheat.
I plan to put in pumpkins, too.
We'd make a good team you and I.
If we pull together, we're bound
to prosper, don't you agree?
- No, I ain't no farmer.
you could try.
I tried it one time with a
widow woman up north of Wamego.
Up and down them God dammed
rows daylight 'til dark.
There's prettier things to look at
than the ass end of an Ox.
One morning I just rode off.
You deserted her.
When I left I was sorry,
but I never did look back.
I see.
So you won't marry me?
- No, I won't.
- I know, I'm plain as an old tin pail.
But would you think about it from here to
Hebron and talk with me about it again?
Talk's cheap.
Mr. Briggs, perhaps you don't
realize what a grand thing
you're doing taking these
poor helpless women home.
If you don't, I assure you the
good Lord does and I do.
This might be the finest,
most generous act of your life.
It might be $300.
- You won't marry me?
- No.
Then I am plain.
I wish you'd say
one kind word to me.
Like what?
That I'm a good woman,
that I've helped you.
Fair enough, you're a damn good woman,
Cuddy, and you've helped me.
I deserted from the Dragoons.
That's right, Company C 1st U.S.,
Fort Kearney, stoled a horse and away I run.
I ain't attached to nothin',
Just me.
No.
- I want to lie with you.
- No.
-You must, I saved your life.
- No.
Please, spare me my dignity, Sir.
Raise your knees.
Take me in your hand.
Just you remember Cuddy,
I didn't force you.
- I will.
- If I hurt you,
- I can't help it.
- I know.
- You asked me, I didn't ask you.
- I know.
- So let me in you.
- Yes.
Cuddy?
Cuddy!
My God in Heaven, Cuddy, we made a deal
to carry these women back to Iowa,
and I kept my word and here
you done and broke yours.
See here? You see what you've done?
You killed her.
Look at her! You killed her!
You're too damned crazy to pay attention
to anything, you God damned lunatics!
You don't know nothing about this world.
Can't even piss straight.
Hadn't been for you,
Mary Bee wouldn't be dead.
She wouldn't even be out here!
If you hadn't gone crazy,
she wouldn't've made this trip.
If you'd stayed steady and
strong, she'd be alive,
and at home,
in her own house.
And so would you, but no,
you went crazy...
and drove her crazy and it killed her,
what do you got to say about that?
Da.
Well, I'll be.
I'm goin' on by myself.
You're on your own.
Far enough along near East where
somebody'll come along and tend to you.
There ain't a damn one of ya
can understand a word I'm saying.
Oh, my God.
How do?
Been carryin' three women outside, hadn't
had anything to eat for three days.
They need supper now, rooms for
the night and a hot baths.
We're fill up.
- With what?
- People.
Mister I didn't come in here
for trouble, but I am tired.
When I'm tired I'm easy to aggravate.
Now this is a hotel, I've got money,
I want supper now, then I
want a room for myself,
then I want the room for three women,
baths
or the reason why not.
Wait here a minute.
- Greetings!
- How do?
My name is Aloysius Duffy,
- and yours is?
- Briggs.
I understand you're in need of a meal
and accommodations, Mr. Briggs.
That's right, for myself
and 3 passengers, women.
Oh, what an unusual cargo, I must say.
In any case, Mr. Briggs,
I regret I cannot oblige you.
- Why not, this is a hotel, ain't it?
- Have a drink on the house.
Grant.
There she went.
Now then, Mr. Briggs, you couldn'ta
shown up at a more inauspicious time.
It so happens a party of 16 potential investors
is coming from St. Louis by steamboat and coach.
I trust you recognize, we cannot
accommodate anyone else.
These are gentlemen of means and the fate of
our entire venture may very well depend on...
We had a bad winter,
traveled a long way to get here.
And they ain't had
nothin' to eat for 3 days.
I'm sorry.
The women are in bad shape,
they're... awful hungry.
Let me see them.
Good God.
- You can't turn us away.
- I can't.
Mr. Briggs, those women
are pitiful, I concede.
But we can't have 'em here tonight,
the milk of human kindness be damned.
Now, kindly, be out the door and
take that wagon away from here.
And God speed to ya.
foot now,
you put them guns down on the floor
real careful and get us our supper
on the table right God damned now.
Shoe's back where it belongs, Mr. Briggs.
Grant, well done.
Be on your way, my friend.
And lament your neglect
at my offering a whiskey.
Why? And I'll tell you why...
you are the worst bunch of lyin', thievin',
pissant sons of bitches I'll ever run into.
You turn your back on these poor women you'll
answer for it for the rest of your lives.
You won't sleep, you'll choke on
your whiskey and on your water.
The food you eat will block up your bowels,
you'll die of your own shit.
Your mothers and your sisters,
and your wives and your daughters
will curse your broke dicks old.
Get on! Get on! Hyah! Hyah!
Get on! Get on! Get! Go on!
Get on! Get on! Get on!
Oh, for God's sake.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Jaw!
Get on there, mule! Go on!
Get on!
Get on!
I'm gonna go get us somethin' to eat.
Now you all be good girls and go to sleep,
I'll be back directly.
You need to get on outta here.
Don't look back, daughter.
Son of a bitch!
God damn that hurts!
Ah, shite!
She looks ridiculous, with...
Pardon, Ma'am, I'm looking
for a woman by the name of Altha Carter,
do you know where her house is at?
- That would be the Minister's wife?
- Yes, Ma'am, that's right, it would be.
Go on down to the Methodist church.
The house across the street,
that's the parsonage.
All right, Ma'am, thank you.
Come, Maisy, don't look at him.
Sir?
Afternoon, Ma'am, are you Mrs. Altha Carter,
the wife of the Methodist Minister?
- I am.
- Well, Ma'am, my name is Briggs.
I'm from the Territories, Loup,
and I've brought you 3 women.
Women?
Oh.
Oh, for goodness sakes, yes!
You have been a long
time coming, Mr. Briggs,
I am relieved you're here.
I'm... I'm sorry Reverend Carter isn't.
He is out burying a beloved
member of our congregation.
Just a minute, I thought a woman
named Cuddy was bringing them.
That's what Reverend Dowd wrote.
She was with us up to a week ago, Ma'am.
I'm sorry to tell you
that a fever took her.
I buried her and we moved on.
Mary Bee Cuddy... was her name.
Oh, what a... terrible loss.
She must have been a fine,
brave human being.
She truly was.
They've ridden all this way...
in that box?
Oh, Mercy!
Well...it's time to meet them.
I'm not sure I'm ready.
Get over there.
- You must have had an awful winter.
- We did, Ma'am.
Put them on the settee, Mr. Briggs.
- Do they speak?
- No.
- Do they understand anything?
- Ma'am, I don't know.
I noticed their eyes move 'round
the room, what does that mean?
That's hard to tell.
Perhaps each remembers
a parlor... from her own past.
Poor, poor dears.
Have you noticed any
improvement in their condition?
They don't scrap with each other
and try to run off anymore.
Tell me their names.
- This Theoline Belknap, she killed her baby.
- Oh, no, no, no!
Please don't tell me, Mr. Briggs,
I don't care to know.
That one there is a Norski woman
by the name Gro Svendsen.
- Very well.
- And that's Arabella Sours.
she even have a doll.
She had 3 little children, lost 'em
all to the diphtheria in 3 days.
Dear Lord!
Please don't say anymore.
There's letters on all 3 of 'em in this
bag here, about their kin folks and all.
I better move on.
They might just jump
up and try t'follow me.
I think this room will hold them.
Oh! I almost forgot.
This is for you, Miss Sours.
It's lovely.
Maybe you'll want it...
one fine day.
Well, goodbye, ladies.
God bless you.
They'll be all right.
I want to say goodbye to you.
You can give this wagon and those mules
and that plaid horse and everything
else to the Methodist Women.
Maybe they can sell everything, use the money
to pay for railroad fare and whatever else.
Mr. Briggs! I'm delighted!
How very generous of you.
Tell the Reverend to give
those mules a good feeding of corn.
- Will you go back to the Territory?
- I don't know.
If you do, please thank Reverend
Dowd for me and wish him well.
Yes, Ma'am.
Well then... this is our goodbye,
Mr. Briggs, give me your hand.
God Our Father, bless this
good man, wherever he may go.
Keep watch over him.
Cause thy face to shine upon him,
and bring him home to Thee one day.
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
I hope we meet again, Mr. Briggs, goodbye.
You can go on now.
Oh, yes, Sir.
Looks better, Sir.
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.
You ain't got no shoes or nothin' on your feet.
Well, that's my business ain't it?
I'll take them shoes, right there.
You're playing high stakes, Sir,
can you show $50?
There's $300... for ya.
- Mind if I have a look?
- Suit yourself.
Have a look at this, Mr. Carmichael.
Bank of Loup, up near Wamego.
How long since you've been there, Sir?
Five... six weeks.
Bank of Loup went bust.
Happens all the time to
sod-buster banks in the Territory.
I've lost more than my fair
share of this wild-cat paper.
You have any greenbacks?
No, I spent it all.
I'm sorry, Sir, I cannot
accept these banknotes.
Nobody around here will.
Sorry, but you can't sit at the
table unless you're playin'.
- I have to ask you to leave.
- What?
Please leave the table, Sir.
You are not socially acceptable here, see?
You ever know a woman by
the name Mary Bee Cuddy?
No, Sir.
These are for you.
You still gotta pay your bill.
That gravy and them biscuits you
made was pretty good.
Thank you.
I gotta good piece of advice for you.
When you get grown,
don't marry some shitty old kid
headed West to make a claim
on a farm he ain't built yet.
Don't do that, you stay here.
- Why?
- Because I told you to.
- Who is Mary Bee Cuddy?
- Mary Bee Cuddy...
was just a fine a woman as ever walked.
- You'll never know her.
- Well, then, so what?
So what?
You are the living, breathing reason
she will never be lost.
That's "what", darlin'.
- You're a strange man.
- Well, I expect I am.
Why don't we marry?
Maybe.
Haul away!
Pull up them shorelines!
- Yeah, I'm good when your are.
- Shove off!
Hang on, by the left.
- Hang on, walk it down, walk it down.
- I got it.
- All right, we're movin'.
- I see... take it down, boys, take it down.
- Let 'er catch up.
- Lead it out.
Take her by her lily white hand,
Lead her like a pigeon.
Make her dance the Weevily Wheat,
scatter her religion.
You boys know the Weevily Wheat?
- Hell, yeah.
- Get on up here
Oh, Charley, he's a fine man,
Charley, he's a dandy.
Every time he goes to town,
he brings his gal some candy.
Hush up that noise,
there's people here trying to sleep!
You sons of bitches!
We are headed West, God damn it!
You've been hiring them
for God damned Navy.
Oh, Charley, he's a fine man,
Charley, he's a dandy.
Every time he goes to town,
he brings his gal some candy.
Charley here and Charley there,
Charley over the ocean.
Charley'd never pass a train
...if he don't see motion.
Clap your hands.
