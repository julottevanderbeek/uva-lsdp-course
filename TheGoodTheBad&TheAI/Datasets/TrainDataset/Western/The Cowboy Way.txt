- Whoo! Yeah!
That brings us now to our final
team, ladies and gentlemen.
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chutes.
These could be our 1993
champion team ropers.
Our boys are just about ready. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chute.
Sonny makes
a good head catch.
Now Pepper rides in, throws
it down, goes to the horn...
they turn and face,
and the time is in!
Checking our official timers.
How 'bout a 5.4!
Ladies and gentlemen, that might be good
enough to win the state championship!
The 1993 New Mexico
State Champion Team Ropers...
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis.
Good goin', boys!
- Thank you!
Hey, Carlos.
How ya doin'?
- Mr. Stark.
- Hey, stuff looks nice.
Looks really nice.
Look, there's some money
missing from petty cash.
- You know anything about it?
- Uh, uh, no, sin'.
Right. All right.
I just thought I'd ask around.
It's good to see you,
Carlos.
You steal from me, and then you
lie to me about it in my face?
Did you take my money?
- Yes! Yes!
- Good! That's what I like to hear.
That's what I like
to hear. Now...
you pay me back, and I won't
add the amount to your debt.
- All right?
- Mr. Stark.
El Señor Huerta's downstain's.
He's by the docks.
What the hell is he
doin' down here?
Manny. Havert seen you
down here in a while.
- John, I don't like this.
- What?
No, no. Look at
this old woman.
She won't live
long enough to work off her debt.
That's why I came
down here tonight.
I have been getting
complaints, John.
Manny, you know it's not an exact system.
We don't always get what we expect.
Qué pasa?
Buscas a alguien?
Dónde está mi papa?
- Quién?
- Mi papá.
Tú vaya con el grupo
primero, okay?
She says she wants
her father.
- What is she talking about?
- Manny, I don't know.
Am I supposed to be personally responsible
for everybody that comes off that boat?
Look, I'll call our people
on the other side...
and I'll
handle this, okay?
Make sure you do that.
All right?
Bueno.
Bienvenidos a los
Estados Unidos de América.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's put our hands together...
and welcome Miss Espanola Valley,
Melba Van Buren!
We're gonna
move to the calf roping event next...
if we can get these two clowns
out of the arena.
I don't know what
they're doin' out there...
but if they're
not careful...
Well, lookee what
the cat drug in.
Hey, Melba. Lookin'
more gorgeous that ever.
Mm-mm-mm.
- All righty.
- Well, here's mine, boys.
- You all gonna wish me luck?
- Shit!
You fellas gonna be cryin'
all the way home tonight.
- What's the deal here, boys?
- Hundred bucks a man.
- One ride, winner takes all. Just the same as always.
- You in, Pepper?
Hobby horse have
a hickory dick? 'Course I'm in.
Bullshit, Pepper. I ain't ridin'
to win no I.O.U. From you.
Yeah, Pepper, you can
keep your damn old I.O.U.
That there's good as gold.
When you know me not to pay my debt?
Shit! When we know you
to pay 'em?
Hell, you still owe me
from last April.
April? Hell, he still owes me
ten bucks from high school.
You didn't get my check,
Eddie? I sent it U.P.S.
You never. You're a lyin'
little son of a bitch, Pepper.
- Who you callin' "little," asshole?
- You,
you little son of a bitch!
He throws his hands in the ain'.
Get away from him, cowboy!
The time is in
for Mike Ray.
The time is
nine seconds flat!
Let him ride.
Yeah, Sonny. What the hell.
Let him ride.
Sonny.
Sonny. Ho! Wait up!
Thanks, man. You just saved Eddie
about four teeth back there.
You win that prize money tonight,
you're payin' off all your debts.
You understand me? Otherwise, it's
gonna be me kickin' your ass tonight.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you just
try kickin' it right now, okay?
Be better than this Eskimo treatment
you been givin' me all year long.
You heard me, Pepper.
Luke Short, Jim Wilshin'e,
our next team out.
Luke rides up, makes
a nice, quick head catch.
Now Jim's gotta ride in.
Throws it down, go to the horn.
Turn and face, and the time...
- Chili Pepper.
Nacho.
Good to see you, man.
- Cómo estás?
- Where the hell have you been?
Oh, I been with
the worms in Mexico.
- Ay, Chihuahua!
- I miss your cookin'.
You talk to Sonny?
Come on, Pepper.
Sonny will forgive you.
Oh, yeah? When?
That rodeo was a year ago.
He ain't said six words to me since.
I told him I was sorry.
What's he want?
Sonny don't care about words.
You have to show him.
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna kiss his ass,
if that's what you mean.
So sour, probably tastes like
a damn old lemon anyhow.
Don't give up on him. You've
been friends too long for that.
Yeah, well, I had a reason for
not showin' up at that rodeo.
Tell him what it was.
He will understand.
Maybe someday, when he ain't bein'
such a damn shit-ass.
- Buena suerte.
- Thanks, viejo.
- Good luck on your ride.
- I don't need luck. I need sleep.
Senoritas.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm single.
- Pepper's still trying to make up, huh?
- Yeah, well, I ain't listenin'.
He's your friend.
You two guys should be out there chasing
that steer together right now.
Friend don't pull a no-show at a national
rodeo final, Nacho. Not in my book.
I had plans for that money.
You know that.
Nothing in your book
about forgiving?
Nacho, Pepper and I
are through, okay?
You got a heart the size
of a tiny raisin, you know that?
Why don't you just
hand me my bronc rein?
If you only knew
what it was to be alone...
you would treasure
your friend.
Where you goin'?
- Home. I'm going home.
- You're not gonna stay and watch me ride?
No. You're a hardheaded donkey with
a heart the size of a tiny raisin,
and I don't want
to watch you ride.
You better have a pot of coffee
waitin' for me when I get home.
Next cowboy out this afternoon...
Sonny Gilstrap
from Belen, New Mexico.
High Dive is the name of the bucking
horse he's drawn this afternoon.
Easy, boy. I got him. I got him.
There we go. There we go.
There we go.
Seventy-five's the score
the cowboy's tryin' to beat...
to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.
An excellent ride for Sonny Gilstrap.
This could be
a high score.
Hard to beat
that one.
Maybe for you.
- Shit.
Seventy-seven points...
for that cowboy!
Let's move up to chute number five.
Keep your eyes right there.
Pepper Lewis, Belen, New Mexico,
is gonna be our next cowboy.
Lone Star is the name
of the bucking horse he's drawn.
- This cowboy's gotta do better than 77 points...
- Okay now.
If he wants to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.
Take it easy now.
He's just about ready.
Say when, buddy.
Lemme have the old hammerheaded
son of a bitch.
Damn! Well, there
goes our money.
- Hope to hell you're happy.
- God, I hate that little peckerwood!
You oughta not let him
in the jackpot, Sonny.
That old Pepper sure can cowboy,
can't he? When he wants to.
The judges signal:
Seventy-nine points
for the cowboy!
Seventy-nine!
Hello?
Yes, this is
Nacho Salazar.
What? Teresa? My daughter
Teresa is in New York City?
God's blessing on you,
Señor Stark.
I'll go get her right away.
Good, good. And please make sure you
bring the other $5,000 with you.
Five thousand? But I
already paid, Señor Stark.
That's what I thought too,
but the people I work for...
said you agreed to pay
another 5,000 on delivery.
No, no, no. That was
not the agreement.
Well, look, I could
try talking to them...
but I don't think
it would do any good.
- Maybe we could go to the police.
- Wait a second, Mr. Salazar.
Think about what you're saying. Your
daughter is in this country illegally.
Yes, of course.
You're right.
All these people are interested
is in the money.
- And all you care about is your daughter.
- But what can I do?
Is there any way
you can get the money?
Yes, I think I can get it.
- Good, good.
- How can I get in touch with you?
My number's 212-555-4320.
You got that?
Yes, I have it.
Señor Stark, my daughter,
is she okay?
She's fine. Just think,
in a couple of days...
you two will be
together again.
Good night,
Mr. Salazar.
"Dear Sonny. Praise God, my daughter
Teresa is out of Cuba.
I've gone to New York City
to pick her up.
I will telephone you as soon
as possible about your guns.
Forgive me. I did not
know what else to do. "
"P.S. Here's
your damn coffee. "
Where are you, Big Chief?
Now, where are you?
I don't wanna play if you
ain't gonna play fain'. Oh!
Big Chief on
trail of naked paleface woman.
Oh. Oh, no.
What are you gonna do when you find
naked paleface woman, Big Chief?
Big Chief gonna teach naked
paleface woman to play his tom-tom.
- Is much fun for Big Chief.
- Oh, no. Not that.
Oh!
Oh. Big Chief.
Now time for
naked paleface woman...
to make Big Chief
happy chief.
Oh. Why, you wicked
old heathen!
Pepper?
Pepper?
Sonny?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Got any of that prize money
left over from the other night?
- Sure. Why?
- Need to borrow it.
- How come?
- None of your business. You gonna loan it to me?
- Yeah. How much you need?
- How much you got?
Just one minute.
I'll check.
- Hey, Sonny.
- Melba.
Big Chief
catch you yet?
He just about
had me when you drove up.
You wanna play?
No, thanks.
You used to like
to play, remember?
- Yeah, well, you're
a married woman now, Melba.
That don't bother
Pepper none.
Yeah, well,
not much does, does it?
Oh, hey. Keep the wigwam
warm for me, baby.
Mmm.
I will return.
Where the hell you
think you're goin'?
You tell me.
You sure as hell ain't
goin' nowhere with me.
- Where you goin'?
- New York City.
New York City? What the hell's
in New York City?
- Nacho.
- Nacho?
He was supposed to pick up his daughter
and call me. That was five days ago.
- You reckon he run into trouble?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
- Let's get goin'.
- I said, you ain't goin' nowhere with me.
- You might need my help.
- I counted on your help once before, remember?
You gonna loan me
that money or not?
You want my money,
not me, is that it?
- That's it.
- Well, my money goes where I go, you know that?
- You go where your money goes, is that a fact?
- Yessin'ee, that's a fact.
- I'm a businessman.
- Well, Mr. Businessman, guess what?
You and your money can both
get the hell outta my truck...
'cause I don't want
either one of you now.
Okay.
I'd rather play
Big Chief anyhow!
Good.
Don't slam the door.
And another thing... I wouldn't throw a
bucket of water on your ass if it was drownin'!
Good. I wouldn't
want you to neither!
Pepper! Get out!
Nacho's my friend!
I'm goin' to help him, not you!
Get out.
Aaah!
Okay. You wanna go? You can go, but
you're ridin' back here, you understand me?
- I swear to God, you are not getting up front with me.
- Not polite to swear to God.
Oh, God! Hey!
- Sonny... Shit!
- Hey.
- Hey!
I told you, Pepper,
you ain't ridin' up front with me.
I don't wanna get up front. I'm just
curious what the hell's goin' on.
All I know is Nacho's been payin' this
guy for the last couple years...
to get his daughter
outta Cuba.
When I got home, there was a note sayin'
she was in New York City...
and he'd gone
to get her.
Nacho must've been hot to get there
if he left before you got home.
Wouldrt you be if someone snuck
your daughter outta Cuba?
I wouldn't let
my daughter go to Cuba.
She didn't go to Cuba.
She was born there.
She never been
nowhere else.
Always somethin'.
You gotta give 'em
one thing, though.
Them Cubans make
a damn fine cigar.
- Okay, goddamn it, you can ride up front with me...
but I don't want you yappin'
my ear off, you understand me?
Peculiar how things
work out, ain't it?
I mean, one minute,
I'm playin' Big Chief.
Next minute, I'm on my way
to New York City.
One day, never been east of Tulsa.
Next day, boom! I'm east of Tulsa.
Peculiar.
Yeah. Woo, woo, woo, woo.
You believe in hypnotism?
I can hypnotize you
while you're drivin'...
only it's probably not good
to do while you're drivin'.
This old boy... has got this
dead-drunk horse passed out in his bed.
So old Tug, who's pretty well
shit-faced himself...
takes one look at
this horse and says...
I don't care
what old Tug says.
I don't care what you say. You been
sayin' it for the last 24 hours straight.
- You don't wanna hear the rest of the story?
- No, I don't!
I don't wanna hear you
talk no more!
- You don't wanna hear me talk no more?
- That's right.
- Okay. That's the way you want it, fine. No more talkin'.
- Good.
Pepper, how far did that sign
say it was to the interstate?
So where you wanna eat?
Okay, Pepper,
finish your damn story.
So Tug takes one look
at this horse and says...
"Well, she ain't pretty, but I wouldn't
kick her outta bed for eatin' oats. "
Oh, Lordy.
Good to be talkin' again.
- Sonny?
- Yeah.
Big, ain't it?
Yeah.
Whoo! Yeah!
Boy, I like this city.
You ever heard such
a racket in your life?
- Huh?
- You ever heard such a...
Forget it.
Hey, how we supposed to track down
Nacho in all this madness?
He left a New York number
on the desktop.
Called it up. Turns out it's
this place called "La Habanita. "
- Little Havana.
- That's right.
So I called 'em up and asked if a Cuban
named Nacho Salazar had been there.
- You know what that bastard did to me?
- What?
He hung up.
I wish I knew his name.
I'd whup his rude ass for ya.
Hey! You know where
Club La Habanita is?
- What'd he say?
- Wa-hee, wa-hee, wa-canna?
- Italian, huh?
- I believe so.
This one's gone.
- The L's are gone from this one.
- Must be a phone book thief on the loose.
I'll try information.
Oh, here.
This works.
Howdy. Hey.
Operator said it was
on Perez Street. Right there.
- One last little piece.
- Goddamn it, Pepper!
You're rippin' out
all my ear hain's.
That'll teach ya not to look at
a phone 'fore you stick it to your ear.
There it is.
Operator said Perez.
Looks more like Juarez.
You two goin' in there?
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes, indeed, sin'.
Why not? Why not?
Why not?
Fella there's about three bricks
shy of a load if you ask me.
Hey, hey.
Dance, senorita?
Come on, Pepper.
Hey. Come on. She likes me.
There's a huge warehouse
in Newark. It's in probate.
You could put
Hell, it's big enough
to let 'em live there.
- How much?
- Quarter of a million.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
I know a guy downtown...
who can get us that same kind of space
for half that price.
- Howdy.
- Hola.
Can I have a whiskey
and a beer, please?
Yeah, a beer and a mescal.
Hold the lime, hold the lemon.
It's a mighty nice
place you got here.
Hell of a nice place.
Friend told us about it.
He was here the other night. Maybe you
remember him. A guy named Nacho Salazar.
Chubby fella about yea tall. Come here
from New Mexico to fetch his daughter.
Guess not.
Sonny, I'd like
to make a toast.
We, uh, spent a little time apart
over the past year...
but it's nice to just
be back... Okay.
Mm. Ohh!
Howdy.
Hey, man, por qué tú no
yippee-hi-yay pa' fuera, huh?
Sonny, I don't think
this fella likes us.
Yeah, well, don't go causing no trouble.
Probably just don't speak English. Howdy.
Speak English?
Sabe English?
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I was gonna tell you...
your face looks like a hatful of
assholes.
Sonny, did you see what
this pukehead just did?
Yeah, well, maybe if you werert bein'
so rude. Try a little politeness.
- "Politeness"?
- Politeness. We're in the city now.
Okay. Politeness.
Uh, sin', I apologize
for my rude behavior.
I don't know what came
over me. Bartender?
Could I get a beer
for my new friend here?
See, a little common courtesy goes
a long way, Pepper.
Amazin', ain't it?
Oh, here's your beer.
Goddamn it, Pepper!
Howdy.
Sonny!
Y tus sombreros
de mierdas!
Thanks for breakin'
my fall.
Here's your hat.
- Why not? Why not?
- Here's your hat.
Well, now you know why not.
Eh, gringos?
Let's get out of here.
- Te llamo mañana.
- Pronto, huh?
Okay.
- What was all that about?
- I don't know. I'll find out, though.
You better take off.
We could get some cops.
John, uh... You were
out of line earlier.
I'm sorry, Manny.
I just...
I just don't want this guy
tryin' to rip you off.
This guy is a friend
of mine for 30 years.
Who was it always told me about
mixing business and friendship?
Always watching
my back, eh, John?
Yeah, Manny, I am.
Always.
- Who were they?
- Two cowboys from New Mexico.
They're looking for
that old Cuban.
How much do they know?
They know he was here
looking for his daughter.
I don't think they
know nothing else.
We made sure
they won't be back.
Oh, you did, huh?
I hope you're right.
Ow. Boy. Hell of a town.
- Ain't been here five minutes, already got our asses whupped.
- Thanks to you.
Here. Take a bite
of this pepper.
Go ahead.
Cures what ails ya.
At least we know someone
in there knows somethin'.
- You figure?
- Hell, yeah.
Second I mentioned Nacho's name, we got them
two damn gorillas standin' right next to us.
- So what now?
- We find us a motel and sleep on it, I reckon.
Oh, hey. Hook a left.
That looks like a motel right there.
A bit uptown for us,
ain't it, Pepper?
Don't worry about a thing.
You're my guest.
- Howdy do?
- Hidy what?
Hidy... He... Hello.
Uh, welcome to the Waldorf.
May I help you?
Yeah. Uh, me and my partner could use
a couple beds. We just blew into town.
- We ain't from around here.
- Really?
Um, just fill this out.
Right away. Fill that out, will ya,
Sonny? I'll take care of the finances.
Okay.
You're a real cowboy,
aren't you?
Been accused of it
a time or two, ma'am.
Well, hell, yeah,
we're real cowboys.
What the hell?
Damn!
Well,
there you go.
Little piece of New Mexico
right there.
Hey, uh, you know,
we were thinkin' maybe later...
to go to a museum,
maybe take in an opera or two.
How's that sound to you?
Will this be cash
or credit card, sin'?
Personal check, if you
don't mind, little darlin'.
I can't believe
she didn't take my damn check.
You ain't got no account. I don't know
why you didn't just pay cash.
Cash? After she insulted me
like that? Hell, no.
At least we can get
a bite while we're here.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
And how would you gentlemen
like those steaks prepared?
"Prepared"?
Oh, you mean cooked.
Yes, sin'. "Cooked" is most definitely what
I should have said. Do excuse me, please.
How would you like
those steaks cooked?
Well, just knock its horns off, wipe its
nasty old ass, and chunk it down on the plate.
Same for me, please.
I will give chef
your instructions exactly.
And would you care
to order wine with your meal?
Uh, yeah. Why don't you bring us
a bottle of somethin'-or-other?
Uh, not too sweet.
American.
American something-or-other.
Yes, sin'. An excellent choice.
And would you like to have glasses, or do
you prefer to drink din'ectly from the bottle?
Well, uh, glasses, I reckon.
Oh, and hey, toss a little ice
in mine if you would, my good man.
Ice. Certainly, sin'.
Nothing could surprise me now.
Hey, tell that cook he better not screw up
them steaks. We're particular about our meat.
Thank you, Pepper.
I hope you enjoy this bottle as much
as you did the previous two.
Mmm. Hmm.
I been thinkin'. We got
but one choice tomorrow.
I think we oughta boot on over
to the police station.
Let them
handle it.
I must say...
they've done a fine job
with this steak.
I don't understand why they
gift-wrap these little lemons...
but the steak
is mighty tasty.
For all we know, Nacho
could've gotten drunk...
and thrown in jail.
It don't really matter.
Fin'st thing in the morning...
we'll make our way over to the police
station, let them handle this.
That's what they
get paid for.
This little secret. We don't
have to tell her right now.
What do you think?
- Jesus Christ, Pepper!
- Ow!
We're in New York City.
That shit don't fly around here.
Whoa!
Would you please...
Just to come
for a fitting.
Will there be
anything else?
Yeah, you got any,
uh, popsicles?
Popsicles.
No, sin'.
Well, I guess
that'll be all, then.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That was wonderful.
- Well, shall we?
- Of course.
- Gentlemen.
- Margarette.
Sonny, take a gander at this.
Tell me what it says.
"Tuesday, 9 p. m. 50 Central
Park South. Top floor. "
"I must see you again.
Margarette. "
Whew. Well, kiss
a duck's red ass.
I do believe she loves me.
I'll be right back.
That amazes me.
That truly amazes me.
I'm beginnin' to like
this town, you know.
- Well, it's time to go.
- Hmm?
- Stop touching me, Pepper!
- Hey, get down.
- Them people think we skipped the check.
- They think right.
- Well, bullshit. Pay 'em.
- With what?
You lyin' son of a bitch.
You told me you still had some of
that prize money left.
- I do. I wouldn't lie to you.
- Well, how much you got?
About eight bucks,
I reckon.
- "Eight bucks, I reckon. "
- Better than a poke in the eye, ain't it?
Pepper, I've had it with you.
Ah! Ooh!
Ah. Don't worry.
Things will get better.
Only when my father comes.
You have to face the fact
that maybe your father isn't coming.
He is coming.
Back to work!
I said, back to work.
Where is my father?
- Let go of me!
- Juan!
Déjala quieta.
- Are you okay?
- No.
There's a sink
in the other room.
Let's go in there and
wash that off, all right?
We'll take care of this.
Come on.
Go ahead.
My father was going to
take me to New Mexico...
to work with him
on the ranch.
Where is my father?
- Please tell me.
- I don't know.
I mean, that's the truth.
The last time...
The last time I talked to him, he was
still trying to raise the money...
to pay me for
getting you outta Cuba.
He already paid you.
Yeah, he paid me. He paid me some.
I mean, he didn't
pay me everything.
Please, sit down.
Your father's comin', Teresa.
I mean, I don't know what's keepin' him.
Until he comes, let me
take you outta here.
These people can be very cruel,
as you just saw.
They take advantage of a pretty girl
any chance they get.
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.
What are you gentlemen
doing here?
Just catchin'
a few winks, officer.
For your information,
there's a law...
against camping
in Central Park, and a fine.
I.D.'s, please.
Are you fellas cowboys?
No, we, uh,
criminals, mostly.
You know,
sleep out in parks.
- Bloodthin'sty shit like that.
- Pepper.
Excuse him, officer.
He wasrt raised with any manners.
- Where you guys from, Texas?
- Texas!
There ain't no real cowboys from Texas.
We're from New Mexico.
So what brings you guys
to New York?
- Lookin' for a friend.
- A friend?
He came here about a week ago.
Havert heard from him since.
Thought we'd come check it out
ourselves, you know?
Hey!
Yeah, hey. You better watch it.
She's liable to come up lame on you.
Oh.
Hey, uh, thanks.
Listen, uh, you guys been to
Missing Persons?
No, sin'.
Come on. I'll, uh,
I'll walk you over.
- Thank you very much.
- Maybe they know something.
Ho.
Almost forgot.
Next time you'll be
a little more polite.
I always wanted to be a cowboy myself.
Ridin' the range.
Always wanted to ride
the Chisholm Trail from end to end.
Of course, the only cow I've ever seen
is over in the Central Park Zoo.
- Sign in, then I'll take you down to Missing Persons.
- Thank you very much.
Hey.
You, uh, you ever heard
of Bill Pickett?
- What's that?
- Bill Pickett. He was a cowboy in the Old West.
He pretty much invented bulldogging.
Black man. Like me.
Who told you that?
- It's true.
- Hey.
Sonny, you hear that?
He thinks some old black cowboy
invented bulldogging.
That'd be
Bill Pickett, Pepper.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Oh, you mean
William Pickett.
Yeah. Oh.
- Age?
- Fifty-five or so.
Social Security number?
I don't even know
if he has one, ma'am.
Any tattoos or
distinguishing marks?
He's got a small scar
over his left eye.
Yeah, I remember that. One night
he got toilet-huggin' drunk...
- Shut up, Pepper.
- Okay.
- That's our friend.
- Goddamn!
- I'm sorry.
- How did it happen?
They found him
in the East River four days ago.
One shot in the head.
His thumbs were tied behind his back.
Oh, Jesus.
We found this
in his shin't pocket.
It's a claim ticket
from a pawn shop.
Listen, uh, let's go
talk to the Chief.
There's nothing more
you can do for him here.
Adiós, my old friend.
They place illegals into domestic work,
prostitution, sweatshops.
There may be 3,000 sweatshops
running in this city alone.
- Goddamn, that's slavery.
- Yeah.
A lot of big cities run on it, whether
anybody wants to admit it or not.
What are you all gonna do about our
friend's daughter, Teresa Salazar?
Look, Mr. Gilstrap, we'll do all
we can to find your friend's daughter.
There's a procedure. Sam will have to file
reports with the I.N.S., the Department of Labor.
It's gonna take time.
You have to be patient.
Damn, who's the law
around here, Sam?
Look, I'm, uh, sorry
I couldn't do more.
I guess I'm
no Bill Pickett.
Yeah, well, not much use
for cowboys these days anyhow.
Look, I'll, uh,
do what I can here.
I'll call you in New Mexico
and keep you posted.
Thanks.
How we supposed to know what
we're lookin' for when we see it?
Lookee there.
It's them
two bastards from last night.
I don't remember seein'
that other guy.
Neither do I, but he sure
as hell looks like the boss to me.
I think we oughta see
what we can find out about that guy.
Okay, I got it.
You go in there and talk to him.
I'll cover the truck.
That's real cowboy
of you, Pepper.
I got a better idea.
Lemme go! Lemme go, lemme go,
lemme go, lemme go! You bully!
Stink factory!
Hey! You settle down,
you ornery little cuss.
Listen here. We wanna
ask you some questions.
- What kinda questions?
- I wanna know about that guy drivin' that fancy car.
I don't know nobody
in no fancy car.
Let's tie some rocks to the peckerwood
and kick him in the river.
- Okay.
- You wouldn't do that to a veteran.
Hell, I'd do it just to see
what it looked like.
So let me get this
straight. These guys smuggle people.
Why? You got somebody you want
smuggled outta someplace?
Answer
the question.
Yeah, Huerta and Stark,
they smuggle people... for a price.
- Who's the boss?
- Huerta's the boss, but Stark does all the legwork.
We got a friend that had somebody
smuggle his daughter outta Cuba.
We were wonderin' maybe you could
tell us where she is.
Now, why would I do that?
Hey, we're the ones askin'
the questions here, bub.
- Why don't we throw him on the spit with the pigeon?
- Okay.
Wait, wait, wait! You just wanna know
where your friend's daughter is, right?
That's right.
And we'll pay you.
- Write you a check.
- Don't take checks.
Twenty bucks.
You get the other half
when you deliver.
Howdy, ma'am.
Hey. How ya doin'?
People so unfriendly here.
It's like talkin' to a bunch of rocks.
Get away from me!
- Pepper, behave yourself.
- He ain't gonna show.
- I only gave him half
a twenty. He'll show.
- Hey! I'm gonna hit him.
- Pepper.
Hey, look.
Well, this towrs
full of surprises.
- Did you have any luck?
- Gimme a smoke.
- There's your brand right there, pal.
- Easy, Pepper.
- You owe me half a twenty, cowboy.
- Yeah, well, earn it.
Your friend's daughter? Stark is
keepin' her in a house over by the river.
Aha. I'm gonna
give you the address.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you show us?
Okay.
Don't waste a lot of money on rent,
I'll say that for him.
- Which one is it?
- On the end there. 4-B.
- Okay, come on. - Oh, no,
no, no. Uh, not me. Mm-mmm.
