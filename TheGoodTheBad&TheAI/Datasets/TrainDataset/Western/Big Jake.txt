Genteel civilization had come
to England, the continent
and the eastern United States.
New York
rivaled London and Paris
as one of the great metropolises
of the world.
Albert Einstein had expounded
his theory of relativity
back in 1905, and science
had brought us the wonders
of the modern world.
Culture and refinement
had arrived
on the east coast of America.
Caruso was singing Pagliacci
at the Met.
Arturo Toscanini was conducting.
The Barrymores were performing
and a Ziegfeld girl
was the rage.
of the 46 United States
was not so refined.
The surviving lndian warriors
were now being rounded up
by the U.S. Army.
ln Washington,
William Howard Taft--
was President
and life was comfortable.
ln other parts of the country,
men were fighting each other
and the elements.
ln the New York
department stores
a lady could buy maxis
and boots and live in style.
Out west,
they didn't think about style,
just living.
Eastern empire builders
had secured their fortunes--
the Morgans,
Vanderbilts, Carnegies.
There were empires
in the west, too,
such as
the great McCandles Ranch.
But these huge ranches
were held together
only by having
enough men and guns.
Notre Dame teams
were playing football
with end Knute Rockne
catching a forward pass.
ln the Arizona Territory
another team,
the Arizona Rangers
were busy just trying
to keep the peace.
Anna Pavlova, prima ballerina
of the Russian ballet,
was dancing Swan Lake.
The dance hall girl in the
Klondike gold rush saloon
was somewhat different.
By 1909, still photographs
had come to life.
Motion pictures had been born
with The Great Train Robbery.
While that make-believe drama
was on the movie screens
nine men crossed the Rio Bravo
into Texas.
The turbulent years
between the Civil War
and the turn of the century
brought out the best
in some people
but in others,
it brought out the worst.
Example: O'Brien,
a half-breed Apache
born of a Chiricahua mother
and lrish father.
A professional gunfighter--
one of the last of his kind.
Pop Dawson--
rode with the James boys
in Kansas and Missouri.
Said to have murdered
more than a dozen men--
one for as little
as seven dollars.
Trooper-- name unknown.
A back-shooter.
Considered a coward.
Reputed to have been
a cavalry soldier
sometime in the past
but not to the personal
knowledge of his confederates.
William Fain,
younger of the Fain brothers.
Favors a shotgun-- a Greener--
for its bloody killing effect
at short range.
James William Duffy.
At age 14, killed his first man
who was an admirer
of his prostitute mother.
Dead shot with a rifle.
William Devries-- young Billy.
Not quite 21.
This raid was thought
to have been
his first outlaw act.
Walt Devries, his older brother
by 20 years.
He looks
more like an lowa farmer
than a professional killer.
John Goodfellow--
may be the worst of them.
An indiscriminate killer.
Women, children,
no consequence at all.
Prefers to work close.
Favors a razor-edged machete.
John Fain-- sometimes peace
officer and bounty hunter.
Served with distinction during
the Spanish-American War.
Professional soldier
thereafter.
Now between wars.
Currently banks,
trains, killings
and responsible for organizing
the infamous McCandles Raid.
Morning, Pancho.
Good morning.
Child, you need some air.
Time to get up, Mr. Jeff.
Delilah, l'm naked.
l seen you naked
the day you was born
and many times
thereafter.
Riders coming.
ls you getting up?
Yes, ma'am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab his head,
grab his head!
Come on, now, hold him,
hold him, hold him.
Hold him, hold him,
hold him.
Chico!
That boy.
Chico!
Chico!
Hey, hey, come on!
Now, l know you'd like
to see Mr. Stubby
ride that bronc again
but go fetch me them eggs
like l asked you to.
Go ahead, now.
Hurry up.
Huh...
Strangers coming.
Mr. Jeff will be
a little late.
You make sure you have
a half a dozen or so
fresh eggs for
him, Moses Brown.
l've already
done that, woman.
For Miss Martha.
l'll take care
of that, boy.
Yes, ma'am.
Why, this is ridiculous.
Breakfast, Miss Martha,
nice and hot.
Thank you, Delilah.
But it's hot.
Just a minute, Delilah.
Bert, this is nineteen
hundred and nine.
There... There just
can't be rustlers.
Can be, Miss McCandles.
l'm 42 years old, and l fought
in the Lincoln County War.
lt's just not
that long ago that...
Why, it's just 15 years ago,
himself, Mr. McCandles hung...
Your breakfast is
getting cold, Miss Martha.
Some lovely flowers in
the garden, Delilah.
l wonder would you ask
Maria to cut them for me?
Yes'm.
You were saying, Bert?
l'm just saying, Miss McCandles
we're close enough to that
Mexican border to...
Spit.
Yes, ma'am, that close.
And we're losing
a lot of cattle.
Let me think about it.
All right, ma'am.
Oh, Bert?
There are some men
riding in.
We could use
some short help,
if you like
the look of them.
Yes, ma'am.
Hyah!
Whoa, whoa.
-Whoa...
-Try him again.
A ranch sure is
a deserted-looking place
during a roundup.
Can l help you men?
We heard
you was hiring.
Was.
But you're late.
Too late?
Afraid so.
Now, this place surely
does bespeak
of a great deal of money,
don't it?
Anything else l can do for you?
Trouble with money, though,
is that there's always somebody
wants to take it away from you.
l said is there anything else
l can do for you, mister?
Still, that's the only problem
with it,
and ain't that
the awful bloody truth?
Billy, you stay close
to me, you hear? Real close.
No!
Run, Little Jake.
Run.
Mrs. McCandles,
you want that
kid alive?
Don't you be a damn fool.
Hey, sonny.
-Hey, Trooper.
-Yeah!
Hyah!
Hey, O'Brien!
The boy!
Why, you mangy little...
Breed!
He's no good to us dead.
l can wait.
Fain,
l don't like
the name ''Breed.''
l'll try and remember that.
Give me that!
Come here, you little...
All right.
Put me down!
Come on,
put me down!
Hyah!
-Hyah!
-Hyah!
Get the doctor,
then find my sons.
And himself, your husband?
l have no husband.
Come on!
Hyah!
Take him to my bed.
Please, be careful with him.
Old Mexico!
There ain't nothing
they can do to us here.
The Mexicans can.
Jeffrey McCandles,
can you hear me?
This fool doctor says
you're going to die
but l say you are not.
l taught you better manners
than to make a liar out of your
mother, Jeffrey McCandles.
He's just sleeping,
Martha.
l know that.
Delilah, there's a big
red strongbox in the attic
l want it.
Yes'm.
We're seeking permission
from the Mexican government
at the highest possible levels,
Mrs. McCandles.
When we receive
that permission,
we are prepared
to enter Mexico
with howsoever many troops
as are acceptable
to the Mexican government
and to deliver
the ransom
wherever and
to whomever directed.
l am told that there
is $1 million in that box.
Buck,
what about you?
Speaking for the Rangers
or for myself?
For yourself.
l got ten of my best men
with me.
l'd like to go after
the boy myself.
lf you say so, Martha,
l'll take that box in.
l am grateful to you both
but l don't think this is
a job for the Rangers, Buck
nor for the Army, sir.
lt is, l think,
going to be a very
harsh and unpleasant
kind of business
and will, l think, require
an extremely harsh
and unpleasant kind
of man to see to it.
No, sir.
No, sir, l ain't.
Haven't butted into
anybody's business
since l was 18 year old
at which time
it almost got me killed.
Ain't going to
start that again.
What's the matter?
Oh, what'd he have
to go and do that for?
You got any last
words, Scotsman?
Aye, give me my bonnet.
My head's cold.
All right, now, let's
get on with the hanging.
Howdy.
Got you kind of surrounded,
haven't they?
This your business, mister?
What is he, a murderer
or a horse thief?
He's a sheep farmer.
Phew, that's where that
horrible odor comes from.
That's right.
How 'bout the boy?
You gonna hang him, too,
or just beat him up
some more?
Mister, you shouldn't
butt into something
that's none of your business,
you really shouldn't.
l think you're right, friend.
A man shouldn't
butt into anything
that ain't his own affair.
Sheep farmer--
you want to sell them sheep?
Uh, yes, sir.
Well, let's see,
l'll give you $100 now
and $300
when l get them to market.
Well, that's highway robbery.
Well, maybe you think
you're going to get
a better offer for them today.
l'll take it.
With one proviso.
What's that?
l go with the sheep.
Good.
You're working for me.
You go ahead.
You go right ahead.
lf there's anything l enjoy more
than hanging a sheepherder
it's hanging somebody who sticks
his nose into my business.
Go on, you try to cut that rope.
No, you've got me scared.
You do it.
Dog!
Get him off! Get him off!
Dog!
Just who in the hell
do you think you are?
Jacob McCandles.
Oh, l, uh...
l thought you were dead,
Mr. McCandles.
Not hardly.
You going to cut him down?
Now his hands.
Foreman's name's Gonzales.
Tell him l sent you.
Take the boy with you.
Thank you, sir.
Come along, son.
lf you follow him,
l'll hunt you down and kill you.
Every mother's son
of you.
Come on, dog.
Seòor McCandles!
Hola, Chihuahua.
Para usted, seòor.
Here you are, Mr. McCandles.
Thanks, Joe.
Hank!
She's in there,
Mr. McCandles, waiting.
What happened
to your spurs?
Oh, they don't work
on these newfangled
velocipedes.
Oh.
Well, see that they get
my gear out of that car.
Yes, sir.
Martha.
lt's been a long time.
lt's good to see you again.
You've changed, Jacob.
Not you.
You're as young
and lovely as ever.
l called you, Jacob
because your grandson
has been kidnapped.
You didn't know
you had a grandson?
You have, by
your son Jeffrey,
and Jeffrey has been
badly wounded by the kidnappers.
Will he live?
This is the ransom note.
The blood on it
is Jeffrey's.
Will he live?
Yes.
l would not contemplate
otherwise.
Do we ha...
Do you have a million dollars?
Yes. And many times that.
Hank!
Yes, ma'am?
Will you bring in
the strongbox, please?
Set it down here
on the table.
That's all.
Yes, ma'am.
ls this the way you want it?
Yes.
They're very dangerous men.
They've already killed
ten people.
Many of them you knew.
Juan and his family...
Teena and the little boy?
Moses Brown.
Old Mose...
lousy cook.
Jacob, as l said, they're very
dangerous and violent people.
And l don't think
we've got any other choice
than to give them
what they've asked for.
l agree.
But you know that, pay or not,
you run the risk of never seeing
the boy again.
l understand.
Well, ''follow the map
until met.''
That's easy.
l'll need food for a week,
water for ten days,
three packhorses
and a good mule.
Waiting for you outside.
Martha, you didn't happen
to think of my Greeners--
the double barrels?
Oh...
Ah...!
Oh... you brought Betsy.
Pays to be careful.
Well, now let's see
if l've forgotten any...
Oh, l'll need
a piece of clothing
that the boy's worn recently.
His?
Yes.
Well...
Hank, who picked the mule?
l did.
Pack it.
Yes, sir.
Don't forget the
rest of the gear.
No, sir.
Hello, Buck.
Hello, you old horse thief.
l thought you was
dead for sure by now.
That'll be the day.
Thinking of taking a trip?
Well, a million dollars
is a lot of money, Jacob.
l thought we might
go with you.
ln those?
They're faster
than a horse.
They'll go farther
and last longer.
lt's 1909, Jacob!
Meaning that my way's
old-fashioned.
Meaning l'm offering my
help, if you'll have me.
Well, thanks, Buck,
but l'll go it alone.
Well, suit yourself, Jacob.
What about me?
James?
Good morning, Daddy.
lt's been some time
since l've seen you.
Ten years, l think.
Nine years and four months.
But you're welcome
to come along, son.
l am moved by your faith
in someone
you haven't seen since
he was 16 years old, Daddy.
''Daddy''?
Daddy.
Daddy.
Well, son, since you haven't
learned to respect your elders
it's time you learned
to respect your betters.
lf you weren't my father...
Go ahead, l give you leave.
lf you're going with me,
l hope you can use that hogleg
better than you can fight.
Does that suit you... Daddy?
You can call me father,
you can call me Jacob,
you can call me Jake,
you can call me
a dirty son of a bitch,
but if you ever call me
''Daddy'' again
l'll finish this fight.
Tiquina?
Seòor?
Tell Sam Sharpnose
l want to see him.
Tell him the same place
as the last time
and all he needs
is his saddle.
Get yourself a good horse.
Oh, Tiquina?
? Si?
Bring the horse back.
Seguro, Seòor.
Where's your brother?
He ought to be here with you.
He'll be here.
Look out for that mule!
l tried to tell you
about them horses, Jacob.
Now you take these here
automobiles...
Jacob, this is
your son Michael.
Father.
Good to see you again.
He's a mite skittish,
isn't he, Father?
The little fellow's
still alive, Mother.
Are you sure?
l saw him.
The kidnappers were
in the Chilicote flatlands,
five hours ago.
Using the automobiles,
l believe the Rangers
can get to the pass
long before the kidnappers,
and set a trap for them.
You want to chance it,
Mother?
Buck?
No matter what happens,
l think they'll kill the boy
sooner or later.
l've got the best riflemen
in Texas with me--
that means in the world.
With luck, at say, 200 yards,
l think maybe we can kill
every one of those animals
before they hear the shots
that did it.
l think it's worth a gamble.
lt's very daring.
Yes... yes, l'll chance it.
What do you think, Jacob?
Suit yourself, Martha.
l was asking your opinion,
Jacob.
No, you made up your mind.
You made your decision alone.
You live it alone.
l was wrong.
You haven't changed,
have you, Jacob McCandles?
Not one bit.
Do it!
You still want me
to take this box in?
Yes.
lf they fail, it falls to you.
You coming along?
No. l'll go with them.
Dog...
let's go!
l hear him.
Sam.
Morning, Jacob.
l brought the saddle.
There's your horse.
Going hunting, Sam.
-Hunting for what?
-Men.
l don't hunt Apaches.
l don't hunt my own people.
You remember that, Jacob.
They kidnapped my grandson, Sam.
l don't know what color they are
and l don't care.
l have no gun.
Close or far?
Close. My eyes... no good.
Me, too.
Keep going!
Any sign of
the kidnappers, son?
Couldn't see anything moving
for miles.
Good, then we must be
ahead of them.
There's a narrow pass
at the end of the valley.
l think it's a good place
for us to trap them.
l'm for it.
Buck, not knowing
where the kidnappers are
we can't chance that pass.
They're young fools.
And l'm an old one.
We're going get that boy.
We'll hide these machines
up at the end of the canyon.
This is a good place
for the ambush.
Jump!
Stop these damn things!
Get out!
Take cover!
Good place for an ambush,
all right.
And we're it.
What happened
to that crazy bicycle?
l think he crashed
into that canyon.
Let's get him out of here.
Come on!
They've had enough, John.
They ain't going to be able
to follow us anymore.
Let's sting them
a little more
and they'll come through
with the money.
That crazy kid.
Yeah.
The horses!
Everybody get
to them horses!
Move it!
Grab that kid!
Stop! Put me down!
Damn it, Pop,
the next time
l tell you to
tie that kid up
don't be worried
about hurting him.
Hyah! Hyah!
Get out of here, you...
Buck...
The boy?
We don't know.
My son Michael?
We don't know, uh...
There was an explosion
southeast of here.
Well, do you have any water?
No.
Well, l'll give you
half of ours.
And as soon as l can
l'll telegraph
that you're walking in.
Going south,
it's going to be some time
before you get to
a telegraph station.
l'm going to have to take one
of your mounts, send for help.
Some of my men are hurt bad.
No, l'll need them.
Anything else?
No.
No, you've been more than
generous, Mr. McCandles.
l think so, Buck.
l'd have killed you
for risking my grandson's life.
lf l find him dead,
l'll still kill ya.
You going along?
Well, the last time l asked you
that question, you said, ''No''
and you said it
in a loud and clear voice.
Now l'm asking you a question:
You coming along?
You damn rights l am, Father.
Throw a blanket on him.
l can ride without a blanket.
l'm not worried about your butt,
it's his back.
Come on.
Something down there.
ls that it?
That's it.
Well, here, you take the mule
down the long way.
l don't want to lose him
even by accident.
You go with him.
l'm going down there.
You'll go where you're told.
Do this, do that.
l'll do as l
damn well please.
You do what
your father tells you
every time he tells you
you might come through
this thing alive.
Maybe even
save the boy's life.
Otherwise, you're going
to get yourself killed.
Don't matter to me,
but you'll probably
get him killed, too.
That does.
Oh, Father, am l
glad to see you.
You ain't dead?
No.
No broken bones?
l don't think so.
Take off your glasses.
My what?
Your goggles.
That's for scaring me
out of ten years of my life,
which l can't spare.
l had to be still.
l didn't know who was
moving around up there.
You hurt?
No.
That's for risking
my grandson's life.
You do that again and l'll break
every bone in your body.
Father...
The next time...
Yeah?
The next time,
l won't take off my goggles.
Whoa.
You all right?
Was.
For an old mule, he's got
quite a kick, don't he?
l think he was using
brass knuckles.
Better mount up
before we lose him.
Wonder what the hell
he has in store for us next.
You know, that's a dirty
habit, if you ask me.
Nobody asked you.
Pa?
Yeah?
You need to wear
glasses, do ya?
Just to see with.
Pa...
Mm-hmm.
They say that Ma
booted you out
'cause you had a weakness
for the ladies.
ls that true?
l mean, no offense,
but l find that hard to believe.
What do you find
hard to believe?
James, cut it out.
l mean, maybe
before you got old
you was quite
a ladies... ooh!
What's the matter
with your leg?
Nothing.
You been favoring it all day.
What's the matter with it?
l got hit by some buckshot,
that's all.
Take down your pants.
Are you on the level?
You going to take down
your pants
or do l have to do it
for you?
You and who else?
Dog.
My, what a beautiful pattern.
He must've been
real close to you.
Will you shut up?
That's a deep one.
Sam, you know
what he did?
Forgot to duck?
He stuck his butt up,
that's what he did.
Boy, when you're in
that kind of a gunfight
keep your butt down.
That's the thing
to remember.
There's always some bustard
on the other side
that's got enough the sense
of humor to shoot you there
instead of in the head,
every time.
How about a shot of whiskey?
Yeah, where is it?
ls that them?
Yep.
Maybe, uh, eight
hours ahead of us.
All of them?
Yep.
They're not trying to
cover their tracks,
that's for sure.
Sam, l got a hunch
we're being followed.
Near or far?
Well, far... l... l...
l feel it more than l know it.
l'll go see.
Where'd you get
those saddles?
Found 'em.
All right, you two,
grab yourself a saddle.
Hurry it up.
Wouldn't want
to lose you children.
We're being followed.
You were right.
How many?
Three or four.
Did you see 'em?
No, but l got close enough
to hear 'em.
They're still
a couple hours behind.
A couple hours, huh?
You better cool off
that horse, Sam.
We'll take a break here.
Give me a swig
of that water.
See to your horses first.
l'll take him.
What kind of a gun is that
you got hanging around
your belly, Michael?
lt's a Bergman 191 1.
Preproduction model,
Father.
We own some stock.
Why is it
so funny-shaped?
The shells load into
a magazine, Father,
the magazine into
the handle of the gun.
lt's gas operated,
you see.
Gas operated?
lt shoots real fast.
Well, Michael,
can you shoot?
Proficiently, Father.
Well...
as many times as you can
before this hits the ground--
like maybe once?
Well, Michael,
you were supposed to shoot.
With this?
lt's a gun, isn't it?
Well, yes, of course.
Well, shoot it.
But, Father...
Boy, you need a keeper.
Pa, l wouldn't
come out just yet.
Sam, l want to offer
my personal apologies.
You can get up now.
l'm not coming out.
Not till you say
l can shoot back.
He fired his six shots.
Pa!
Stop interrupting.
Put that thing away.
That damn mule!
lf he busts up that box,
Michael, you'll... ouch.
Till you're used to
the safety on this...
Being dry, you better
help your father.
Oh.
Father, l...
Proficient, eh?
Now, what was it
you were trying to tell me?
That there were eight shots
in that gun.
Oh, thanks.
Give me a hand here.
Father, there has been
a misunderstanding.
When l said that l could
shoot proficiently
l meant with this.
-With that?
-Yes, sir.
Pick a target.
That tall tree there,
the edge of the small
broken branch.
Son, that's over 400 yards.
Nearer five.
Well, if you can shoot
that far,
quarter of a mile straight
along the edge of my nose
is a mountain buck.
Shoot it.
l don't kill to make
a point, Father.
Michael,
there's two reasons to kill:
survival and meat.
We need meat.
Oh, it's too late.
That's good shooting.
Not bad.
Father, you want
to try a shot?
Scope's set
for 500 yards.
Son, l couldn't
see that far.
Sam?!
Give me a hand
packing that mule.
Michael, let me see
that hand gun.
That sure is something.
Damn.
Something wrong, Father?
Well, l can sleep cold,
eat raw meat, even raw fish,
but, come evening,
l sure miss my hot coffee.
Open me up a can
of them peaches.
Hey... quite
an improvement.
l'll bet you could almost get
that fancy gun
out of that fancy holster
before some fast gentleman
with an old-fashioned six gun
blew a hole in you.
blew a hole in you.
-Oh...
-You know what l think?
A spring... a spring at
the bottom of the holster.
lt might work.
Sure spending a lot of time
with this thing.
Michael, do you
really think
that Little Jake
is still alive?
What did you call him?
He called him
Little Jake, Father.
Mom insisted.
Well, l'll be damned.
You didn't know he was named
after you, did you?
No, l didn't.
Well, l guess it's
kind of hard to keep in touch.
l mean, you run out
on your family that way.
You never hear that at home.
You're short on ears
and long on mouth.
Will you ever learn
to can it, James?
Well, you sure are respectful
of his feelings,
l'll say that for you.
Me?
He was right.
Yeah.
That's the trouble.
Oh, thanks.
What's the boy like,
Michael?
He's like you
and James, Pa.
Like me and James?
Still four or five of them?
Yep, but they
haven't closed in yet.
They're being real quiet.
How close?
Maybe another hour.
There's one closer, though,
right behind your head.
l don't know whether
he's with them or not.
He... sits his horse out there
about 200 yards.
He waits. He listens.
Wonder what he wants.
l could kill him, Jacob.
Real easy.
ln cold blood?
Oh, you're squeamish, are you?
Well, between your brother's
love of pretty toys
and your high moral tone,
l hope you don't get killed
before this thing's over.
We'll wait.
You won't have to.
He's coming in.
James, come on.
Hello to camp.
Can l come in?
Come on in and welcome.
Well...
l was hoping for
a cup of coffee
but you're running
a cold camp here.
Yep.
How about a peach?
No, that's hurts my teeth.
Well, l got hooked on these
when l was a younker.
Could never get my fill.
Oh, hell, mister,
you don't need that.
l'm not a damn fool.
l know you got
three or four men
out there watching me.
Can l move my hand?
Go ahead.
That's my bona fides.
Well, l hope that boy
don't catch a cold.
That would cause me
great annoyance and displeasure.
Mister, that just scares
the hell out of me--
the thought that you
might be annoyed.
l'm glad to hear that.
Now, did you come here
to give me a message
or just to pass the time of day?
From here you go to Escondero.
You wait there
till you hear from us.
You've been following us two,
maybe three days.
Why did you wait so long?
l haven't been following you.
l've been waiting right here
just like the map says.
Oh?
Hey... that the money?
Open her up.
l'd like to look at it.
Help yourself...
just as soon
as you bring in the boy.
Who are you?
Just say l work
for the McCandles.
The boy mean anything to you?
Never laid eyes on him.
But l'm being paid to bring him
back alive or you dead.
Each and every one of you.
Now, l'd rather
bring the boy back.
That's easier.
But when it comes
right down to it,
don't matter to me.
l'll earn my pay
one way or the other.
Now, how about you?
Are you the Big Chief
or one of the little lndians?
Oh, just a little lndian.
Just a messenger boy.
Well, you've delivered
the message.
That's all.
There's more.
l'm in here alone.
You've been followed
like you think.
You best stay
right on your toes.
You be real tough, real loose.
What you got in that box
is too big to keep a secret
and the thing is this:
you got to deliver that box
to us.
You got to put it
right in our hands.
You understand?
Good intentions won't buy you
nothing but that boy's corpse.
lt's just as
simple as that.
Somebody takes that
box away from you
we won't be understanding, we
won't wait, we won't try again.
l'll just send that boy's body
back to you in a basket.
You understand?
Mister, l said,
do you understand me?
l understand.
Jacob...
What's the matter?
l make big mistake.
ln that stand of trees,
there's two men.
They'll have heard
where we're going.
Kill 'em.
Dog, go with him.
Bring in the horses
and get that stuff packed.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Well?
l'm gettin' old.
There were two men,
l killed one.
Damn.
That means they'll get us
at Escondero for sure.
Escondero.
Where have l heard
that name before?
Boom town. Oil.
Well, that cuts it.
Yeah, must be a celebration.
Town will be loaded
with strangers.
Ain't this
a little showy, Pa?
l mean, that big red box
and all the guns out?
l hate secrets.
Never knew one to be kept.
They've all heard
what's in that red box
and they all want it.
What we're doin'
by this ostentatious display
is telling them
they can't have it.
Hell, we may... may be savin'
some poor miscreant soul's life
by doing this.
Maybe even our own.
Go unpack that piggy bank
and the rest of our gear.
Hey, Jamaco!
Lleba los caballos.
Si, Seòor.
Man, when they fiesta
in this town,
they really fiesta.
What's the matter with you?
He's the one
got away, Jacob.
Want me to get 'im?
No.
But keep an eye on him.
Probably a lot more.
Dog.
Oh, this is heavy.
Feels like
it's full of rocks.
l'm going to get me
a big private room
with a big soft bed...
One big room
and one big bed
for all of us.
Money doesn't
grow on trees.
Give us a room.
The dog is all right, but,
uh, we do not allow lndians.
He's with me.
No lndians.
No lndians?
l'll sleep in the barn.
The Jacob McCandles?
That's right.
My apologies, Mr. McCandles.
l thought you was dead, sir.
Dead?
Next man says that to me,
l'm gonna shoot, so help me.
Dog.
Bring it up.
Put it over there
in the corner.
Oh, don't tell me
it's that heavy.
lt sure is!
l never knew money
could weigh so much.
What time is it?
l can't believe
l got two sons
who don't own a watch.
Nor a window
to throw it out of.
Pretty near dark.
Yep. 5:00.
Man! Take a look
at Babylon.
They're going to have themselves
a real party tonight.
l wish l could dance me
a jig with a pretty lady.
Why not?
Oh, because of the box.
Yeah, and the men
who followed us in.
We're walking into trouble.
What do you do
when cockroaches
get in the woodwork,
Michael?
Smoke 'em out?
That's right.
Why not wait until
they make a move?
Because waitin's good
for them and bad for us.
You get impatient, nervy,
careless, maybe dead.
l've seen it.
Besides, you two children
haven't had the experience
for that sort of thing
and l don't have the patience.
So we're gonna invite 'em
here tonight.
Now, Father,
l think that...
You think?
Michael, your thinking's
already cost us some lives.
l intend to hang on to mine.
Your father got us this far
'cause he knows what he's doin',
so for the next 24 hours,
why don't you both
just keep your mouths
shut and listen to him?
That's more words than l spoke
since l know you.
Gentlemen, agreed?
All right, Sam.
l want you to go down
and take a look
at the horses.
Make yourself seen
around the stables
and tonight, James,
you go out
and have yourself
a real good time
and when l leave
this room, Michael
you'll be the sittin' duck.
With only you
between them
and that box
they'll think
it's going to be
like taking candy
away from a baby.
Tonight, Sam, there's
going to be a...
disturbance out
on the street.
l want you to
come over the roof
and into the window.
But you tell him
not to shoot me,
not even by accident.
Yeah, remind...
l heard him.
Father, you know what
you're letting
yourself in for.
There's a little
eight-year-old boy
somewhere out there
scared, lonely,
and probably wondering
what's happened
to his world.
We came here to find him
and take him home,
alive, if possible.
That's what l intend to do.
He's right about one thing:
You'll be all alone
down there.
No sweat.
All right, Sam, you better
pick up another shotgun,
a Greener, if possible.
Well, l'm gonna take
myself a nap.
You wake me up, 9:00, for sure.
Now, you two young fools
be careful tonight
because if you
get yourself killed
your mother'd never
let me hear the end of it.
Por favor, amigo.
Whew.
Pardon me.
Are you with these
oil-drillers?
Yep.
Well, could you
tell me which one
is the orneriest
in your outfit?
Oh, that's easy.
Mr. Sweet!
That portly gentleman
right over there,
with the beard.
Thank you.
Mr. Sweet?
Yes?
May l?
You shouldn't have done that.
You were right.
You're a little overmatched,
aren't you?
Do you want some help?
No.
You better quit being
unfriendly, mister.
Sam's made it, Pa.
Well, it's about time.
Hold it.
Just a minute, friend.
l think there's
been a mistake.
Have you ever been
to Nacogdoches?
Nacogdoches?
No.
Strange.
Pardon me.
But l ain't never been
to Nacogdoches.
Damn it, mister,
l believe you.
You're next.
Please sit
down, sir.
Thank you.
Say, l was lookin' at...
do l read right?
Oh, yes, sir.
Genuine hot showers
imported all the way
from St. Louis.
The only one of its kind
between Dallas and Mexico City.
Ah.
l highly recommend it, Seòor.
?Donde?
Over there.
Muchicimas gracias.
Hey, how about
let's get out of here?
After we finish this dance.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, man!
They ought to have
one of these
in every barbershop
in the world.
Mas tante, maestro.
Be through in a
minute, mister.
Take your time, mister.
Man, l smell as sweet
as lilies
of the valley right now.
l'm in no hurry, friend.
You just take your time.
Muchacho.
Venga aqui.
Si, seòor.
There's a cantina
at the far edge of town
named Sanchez's.
You know it?
Si, seòor.
You go there and buy me
a bottle of tequila.
Pero la cantina
esta aqui cerca.
Nowhere else, mind you.
Now, they have a brand
special for me.
Now, that's what l want.
Go fetch it.
Si, seòor.
Well...
guess l'm finished.
You stay right where you are.
Unless you want
to hurry things.
Take your choice.
No hurry.
No hurry at all.
But l could use
those clothes over there.
l'm getting a little cold.
You don't shut up
and stay where you are,
you'll be a lot colder.
Here.
Protect yourself with this.
Why don't you
buy me a drink now?
Well, l thought
we was leaving.
Later.
Hmm.
Am l too heavy?
No, not at all.
Hey, you...
with that fancy holster on.
Yeah, you.
You got my woman.
Sorry.
That's my woman.
All right, friend.
Hey, don't turn
your back on me
while l'm talking to you.
My apologies, sir, if l've o--
Shut up!
Yes, sir.
Well, you sure
don't rile very easy, sonny.
You know, son,
you are a coward.
Yeah... yeah, you're a coward.
Yeah, a live coward.
Now let's hear you say it.
All right.
l'm a coward.
Hey, l think l finally
said something
to rile the boy.
You sure did.
Well, friend...
that's it.
No hard feelings.
The hell there ain't.
Sam!
Anybody hurt?
What's the matter?
Shotgun blast
broke the lock, Jacob.
Newspaper clippings.
l killed a man
for newspaper clippings.
Where's the money, Father?
Where is it, Daddy?
You think l stole it?
You think l stole it, Michael?
Tell the lndian
to go for a walk.
Go for a walk, Sam.
You sure, Jacob?
Sure. Take the
dog with you.
Go with him, dog.
Now what?
Where's the money, Daddy?
You go to hell.
James?
Now, boys, you know that's...
that's no way to treat
your old daddy.
Jokes!
Can l come in now?
Come on in.
Well, there ain't no money.
There never has been.
That's right, never has been.
lt was your mother's decision,
and mine,
that we take the boy
and not pay for him.
My mother's decision?
l don't believe you.
There were seven McCandles
people killed, one crippled.
Your own brother shot--
maybe crippled,
maybe even dead--
and my grandson kidnapped.
l ain't gonna pay 'em for that.
Neither is your mother.
l thought l knew her.
Not hardly.
lt can't be done, Pa.
They'll kill
Little Jake for sure.
Not if we kill them first.
There you are, Jacob.
Just like new.
Quiet, dog.
What are you
snooping around for?
l ain't snoopin'.
l come to get ya.
Your horses are saddled
out in back, so let's go.
Where to?
l'll take you there.
That's all
you need to know.
'Ceptin' if you
don't have the money...
or l ain't back within
or if somebody tries
to follow us
to the meetin' place...
or tries to keep us
from leaving after
we get the money, we'll
kill that little boy.
Well, l ain't gonna give
you the money
till l get the little boy.
Now how you gonna do it?
We'll have a rifle on him.
With a real fine sharpshooter
behind it,
with one of them fancy
new telescopic sights.
From the time you
set eyes on him,
until one hour
after we vamoose,
you won't know
where our man is,
and we won't be able
to tell him not to shoot
even if we was so inclined.
Something goes wrong,
that little boy is dead,
sure as shootin'.
Well, uh... give us
a couple of minutes
to pull ourselves together.
The front's being watched.
l'll be out in back myself.
Means they're close by.
James, give me back my watch.
Don't you ever return
things you borrow?
lt's full of pictures.
Yeah.
Michael, the sharpshooter
is yours.
Kill him.
How?
Well, get lucky.
Or better still,
pray that l get lucky
and make him miss
the first shot.
That'll give you
about ten seconds
to see his powder
flare, locate him,
and keep him
from shooting again.
Nothin' to it.
Well, let's get go--
Where's the other one?
There's supposed to be
four of you.
He's dead.
We had to pay a price
to keep that box
for you and your friends.
l was told to bring in
all of you or none of you,
so's we could keep
an eye on you, understand?
No loose ends.
Well, he's dead.
l want to see his body.
All right.
He's laid out with
the rest of 'em,
down at the jailhouse.
Jailhouse?
Right over there.
Jailhouse...
Come on, let's go see him.
We haven't got all night.
Never mind.
lt ain't important.
You gents is gettin'
a little nervous, ain't ya?
Let's go.
Sam...
wish it were a little later.
Uh-huh.
Pitchfork rain right now
would be in our favor.
Lightning might help.
Might hurt, too.
Hey, what's that?!
Too late to do him any good.
There's another one inside.
He's dead, too.
The night watchman.
Say, you ain't
a-lookin' too good.
Sight of blood bother
you or something?
Only my own.
Oh.
Well, this is where
everybody stops, except you.
You take that box in alone.
You'll be met
at the other end.
Well, Sam, they say
the elk in Montana
are as big as
buffalo this year.
We ought to go hunt 'em
when this is over.
l look forward to that.
l wish they were buffalo.
Yeah.
Times change.
Gimme that mule.
James...
l see him.
Dog.
Good to see you made it.
Yeah, we've had a full day.
Guess he don't like
anybody behind him.
Neither do l.
All right, that goes
for you, too, Fatty.
Get out where
l can see you.
You must figure
l'm a real dangerous man.
Will, come on down.
l told you to move, Fatty.
Dog.
Get him off me!
Call your dog off!
Get him away!
Get him off of me!
Call that dog off!
Fain!
l wouldn't do that.
Call your dog off.
Get him off!
Dog.
Now call off yours.
The box.
Open it up.
The boy.
Will.
Stay.
Open it up.
Take that hood off.
Like to see what l'm buying.
l just saw something
in your eyes
l don't like.
l saw a foolish thought.
You understand me.
Anything happens,
anything at all,
your fault, my fault,
nobody's fault--
my little brother
will blow that kid's
head right off.
lt's as
simple as that.
No matter who else gets killed,
that boy dies.
lf the shotgun misses him,
it don't matter.
You already know about
the rifle on him.
That won't be as messy
as a shotgun at three feet
but that boy will be
just as dead.
You understand me?
Say it.
l understand.
Now, open it up.
That's the stuff
that dreams are made of.
What's a million dollars
look like, John?
Now you understand.
lf anything goes wrong--
anything at all--
your fault, my fault,
nobody's fault, it don't matter.
l'm gonna blow your head off.
lt's as simple as that.
What did he say?
l can't hear him.
No matter what else happens,
no matter who gets killed,
l'm gonna blow your head off.
Something wrong, John?
Kill the boy!
Dog!
Come on, little Jake!
Run!
Gimme that shotgun!
Whoa...!
Will.
Will!
He's dead.
l want his shotgun.
Hurt?
Yeah.
Put your finger there.
Are you hurt?
No, l'm scared.
So am l.
But don't let them know it.
Jake.
Yes, sir?
You ever fire a gun?
No, sir.
Well, use it if you have to.
Yes, sir.
Now, when l start firing
you hightail it out
there and find James.
Yes, sir.
Ready?
Yes, sir.
Go!
Boy's outside! Kill him!
You hear that?
They got the boy.
The hell l did,
that's my derringer.
James! Uncle James!
Oh!
Jake, get out of here!
Hide! The stables!
That sound like a derringer?
l wouldn't.
Holster it.
Raise your hands.
The other's broke.
That'll do just fine.
Now turn around.
Real slow.
l hear you killed two good men
in a fair fight tonight.
ls that right?
No. Three, counting you.
Prove it.
That sound like a boy screaming?
Wonder how he's gonna get it?
With a bullet or a machete,
like the lndian did.
l wouldn't.
You come close, Mister,
but no cigar.
Who are you?
Jacob McCandles.
l thought you was dead.
Not hardly.
Michael, that's
the second time
tonight you've
saved my life.
The first time,
l was a little slow.
You mean that?
lt was nothing.
Jacob, here, took care
of that, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Yes, sir.
Are you my grandfather?
Yes, sir, l sure am.
James.
Dad.
Sounds better.
Let's go home.
Good idea.
