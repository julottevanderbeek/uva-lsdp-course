YOU GIVE THESE BOYS
A $2.00 BOTTLE ON ME,
AND THEN I'LL STAND

AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR PROFIT ON THE WHISKEY.
THAT'S GOOD.

WHY DON'T YOU USE THAT?
WELL, THERE'S 52 THERE.

LIQUOR, ARE YOU?

GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FLASK.

WHAT'S IT MATTER
IF SMALLEY'S IN?
AND DRIED PEAS.
CHURCH COMIN' ALONG
NICELY, ISN'T IT?
I WAS TALKIN'

CAN'T WAIT
TILL WE GET IT FINISHED.
HEY, WHO'S
THE DEALER?
FELLOW BY THE NAME
OF McCABE.
WHAT?
McCABE.
HOW DO
YOU KNOW THAT?
WHO SAID HIS NAME
WAS McCABE?
JOE SHORTREED
TOLD ME.
WELL, HOW DOES HE KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
McCABE TOLD HIM.
NOW I'VE
SEEN EVERYTHING.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
MOVE SO FAST
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?
I'M BEATIN' HIS ASS.
DRINK ON THE HOUSE,
MR. McCABE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'LL SEE YOU.
YOU DIDN'T SAY
YOUR NAME WAS McCABE
WHEN YOU COME IN
HERE.
I DIDN'T SAY IT NOW.
YOU DID.
I'LL RAISE
YOU UP 2.
I'LL CALL.
PUDGY McCABE?
GUNFIGHTER?
BUSINESSMAN.
BUSINESSMAN.
BUSINESS AIN'T
SO GOOD, IS IT?
DID YOU EVER KNOW
BILL ROUNDTREE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, SHEEHAN?
YOU GOT A TURD IN YOUR
POCKET OR SOMETHIN'?
WE'RE TRYIN'
TO PLAY SOME POKER HERE.
I GOT A KING HERE.
BART, YOU'RE GETTIN'
SLICK AS A CAT'S ASS.
HEY, PARTNER.
YOU WANT TO DEAL
A COUPLE HANDS FOR ME?
SURE. YOU'RE NOT
LEAVIN', ARE YOU?
YOU'RE NOT QUITTIN'?
OH, NO. BE RIGHT BACK,
GENTLEMEN. RIGHT BACK.
MY GOOD MAN.
TRY NOT TO DROP

I WAS JUST WONDERIN'
WHERE YOU WAS GONNA GO.
WELL, I WAS GONNA GO
OVER THERE BY THAT FENCE.
OH.
YES, SIR. THAT'S McCABE,
ALL RIGHT. JOHN McCABE.
USED TO BE CALLED
"PUDGY" McCABE.
GOT A BIG REP.
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
WELL, HE'S GOT
A BIG REP.
WHY THEY CALL HIM PUDGY?
HE DON'T LOOK SO FAT.
HOW IN THE HELL
WOULD I KNOW?
ANYWAY, HE'S THE MAN
THAT SHOT
BILL ROUNDTREE.
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF HIM, EITHER.
I'VE KNOW OF ROUNDTREE.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
FROM WHERE,
BUT I KNOW THE NAME.
WELL, HE WASN'T
NOBODY TO MESS WITH.
THAT MAN OUT THERE
TAKING A PEE SHOT HIM.
HE'S GOT A BIG REP.
GENTLEMEN, YOUR DEALER
IS NONE OTHER
THAN JOHN McCABE.
PUDGY McCABE?
THE MAN THAT SHOT
BILL ROUNDTREE.
HE REALLY IS
A GUNFIGHTER.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE HELL HE IS.
HE SHOT BILL ROUNDTREE?
McCABE REALLY
SHOT HIM?
I KNEW
BILL ROUNDTREE.
WHO IS HE?
HE WAS A GOVERNOR.
HE WAS RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR
IN WYOMING.
JEREMY, YOU ARE
SO FULL OF SHIT.
DAMN. OUT THERE
KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE A 3-SQUIRT DOG
IN A 30-MILE WIND.
THAT EGG'S RAW, AIN'T IT?
YEAH.
OK.
TELL ME SOMETHING, BOYS.
WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY
AROUND HERE?
SHEEHAN OWNS ALL THE PROPERTY
THIS SIDE OF TOWN.
THE CHINESE DON'T
OWN NO PROPERTY.
THEY JUST
POACH IN MINES.
AND JOE SHORTREED,
J.J., BILL CUBBS, MYSELF,
OWN THAT WHOLE OTHER SIDE
OF THE CHURCH.
McCABE, HOW LONG
YOU FIGURE ON STAYIN'?
WELL, THESE BOYS GOT MY
TIT IN A WRINGER HERE.
I HATE TO MOVE ON
WHEN I'M LOSIN'.
YOU CAN FLOP HERE
FOR 2 BITS A NIGHT.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.
SORRY. UH...
OH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IF I, UM...
CUT MY BEARD OFF
AND JUST, UH,
LEFT MY MUSTACHE?
WHY YOU WANT
TO DO THAT FOR?
YOU GOT MANY CHINKS
AROUND HERE?
YOU JUST
TURN OVER A ROCK.
WHO SELLS THEM
THEIR MUD, YOU?
NOT ME.
I SELL WHISKEY.
I DON'T TOLERATE
OPIUM SMOKERS AROUND HERE.
WELL?
SHIT.
WHY DON'T YOU
DO LIKE I DO, YOU KNOW,
JUST TRIM A LITTLE BIT
OFF THE SIDES THERE.
STRAIGHT DOWN.
DOWN, HUH?
I WOULDN'T STAY UP THERE
FOR FREE
IF YOU HAD A GODDAMN
SAN FRANCISCO WHORE
IN EVERY BED.
GET UP, COYLE.
THE DEALER'S BACK.
HEY, BART.

YOU SHOVE A 4x4
UP A MULE'S ASS.
SHOULD WE MAKE THIS
A QUARTER GAME NOW?
LET'S MAKE IT

WE WOULD HAVE HAD THEM UP--
WE WOULD HAVE
HAD 'EM UP BY NOW,
EXCEPT ROBBY'S HAD THE RUNS.
SO WE'VE BEEN TRYIN' NOT TO USE

IT'S BEEN GOIN' AROUND,
MR. McCABE.
MRS. DUNN, SHE'S...
MRS. DUNN'S

SO WE DECIDED TO PUT
THE KING POST...
YOU GONNA

THEY'RE
VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL
ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAIN
WE'VE BEEN HAVIN' HERE. UH...
WE HAD TO USE THE CANVAS
FOR THE TENTS
UP ON THE ROOF,
BECAUSE OF THE RAIN.
I'M GOIN'
TO TALK TO HER.
THAT'S A REAL
PRETTY DRESS--
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME.
LET GO, NOW.
LET HER GO! YOU--
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON?

FOR CHRIST'S SAKE?
ROBBY, YOU GOT
A JOB TO DO, AIN'T YOU?
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA TOUCH
ONE OF THEM LITTLE LADIES

YOU, UH, YOU KNOW
I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND,
DON'T YOU, McCABE?
WHY?
WELL, YOU AND ME'S
THE ONLY 2 REAL BUSINESSMEN
IN PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
THAT AIN'T A WHOLE LOT
TO HAVE IN COMMON, IS IT?
WELL...
YOU'RE A CATHOLIC,
AIN'T YOU?
NOPE.
OH.
WELL, UH...
THE MINUTE I SEEN YOU
RIDE INTO TOWN,
I KNEW YOU WAS A MAN
TO BE RECKONED WITH.
SHEEHAN,
THAT'S A LOT OF SHIT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
NOW,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL IT IS
YOU COME UP HERE FOR,
AND MOVE AWAY
FROM THAT STOVE.
YOU GET KIND OF RIPE
WHEN IT'S WARM.
NOW, LISTEN, McCABE.
I'M NO DUMMY.
YOU'RE NO DUMMY.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO THIS TOWN
WHEN IT GETS BIG ENOUGH
TO HAVE 3 SALOONS,
MAYBE EVEN 4, HMM?
YOU AND ME COULD FORM
A PARTNERSHIP,
A PARTNERSHIP
THAT'LL KEEP ANY OUTSIDER
FROM COMIN' IN HERE
AND BUILDIN' OTHER SALOONS
WITHOUT YOU AND ME
SAYIN' IT'S ALL RIGHT
AND TAKIN' OUR CUT. HUH?
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
WELL, PARTNERS IS
WHAT I COME UP HERE
TO GET AWAY FROM.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T
HAVE THINGS YOUR OWN WAY.
SOMETIMES YOU GOT
TO MAKE A DEAL.
DEALS I DON'T MIND. IT'S
PARTNERS I DON'T LIKE.
SIT DOWN, CHAMP.
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS,
I'VE TAKEN A FUNNY KIND
OF LIKIN' TO YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH,
AND I WANT TO MAKE
ONE GODDAMN THING
GODDAMN CLEAR TO YOU.
YEAH?
SHEEHAN,
IF A FROG HAD WINGS,
HE WOULDN'T BUMP
HIS ASS SO MUCH.
FOLLOW ME?
YEAH.
AAH!
AAH!
* YES, YOU WHO MUST
LEAVE EVERYTHING *
* THAT YOU CANNOT CONTROL *
* IT BEGINS
WITH YOUR FAMILY *
* BUT SOON IT COMES ROUND
TO YOUR SOUL *
* WELL, I'VE BEEN
WHERE YOU'RE HANGING *
* AND I THINK I CAN SEE
HOW YOU'VE BEEN *
* WHEN YOU'RE NOT
FEELING HOLY *
* YOU'RE LEARNING
HOW SADLY YOU'VE SINNED *
LOOK, MORE WHORES.
SHUT UP, WOMAN.
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT ISN'T
BART'S MAIL-ORDER BRIDE?
DAMN IT,
I'LL BET IT IS HER.
IDA.

IDA. IDA.
IT'S ME, BARTLEY COYLE.
IDA, I THINK
THIS IS FOR YOU.

MRS. MILLER.
COME FROM BEARPAW
TO SEE YOU.
IS THIS YOUR PLACE?
UH, YES, MA'AM.
SALOON, EH?
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
SALOON AND GAMBLIN'.
DID YOU SAY YOU
COME UP HERE
FROM BEARPAW
TO SEE ME?
MA'AM...
UH, IS THERE SOMETHIN'
I CAN DO FOR YOU?
DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO EAT?
I'M BLOODY STARVIN'.
IT TOOK 6 HOURS
TO GET UP HERE
IN THAT FLIPPING
CONTRAPTION.
UH...WELL, YOU
HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
MY KITCHEN AIN'T
IN OPERATION YET,
BUT I COULD TAKE YOU
TO THE RESTAURANT UP THERE
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY ENOUGH.
I'M HUNGRY ENOUGH.
I COULD EAT A BLOODY HORSE.
WELL, AT SHEEHAN'S PLACE,
YOU PROBABLY WILL.
ANOTHER FRONTIER
WIT, I SEE.
GO RIGHT UP
THE STAIRS THERE.
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL
A REAL GENTEEL LADY
BY THE WAY
SHE WALKS.
WELL, TELL ME, ANY NEWS
FROM DOWN IN BEARPAW?
IT'S BEEN
A WHILE SINCE--
HOW MANY MEN
ARE THERE AROUND HERE?
THIS HERE'S
AN INTERESTING TOWN.
THERE'S, UH, GONNA BE
UPWARDS OF 100, 125 MEN
BEFORE LONG.
HELLO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SMALLEY?
ABOUT WHAT?
DON'T YOU SEE
NOTHIN' DIFFERENT?
NO.
SHEEHAN?
SHEEHAN?
YEAH.
AH. COMPANY, I SEE.
WHAT YOU GOT
FOR SUPPER, SHEEHAN?
ALFIE,
GET THE TABLECLOTH.
UH, GOT SOME NICE TRIPE,
AND, UH, MRS. DUNN JUST
PUT THE STEW ON THE FIRE.
GOT ANY MORE OF THEM, UH,
MOUNTAIN OYSTERS?
UH, GOT SOME NICE
DEER MEAT.
GOT ANY EGGS?
FRESH EGGS?
YEAH, FRESH EGGS.
I'LL HAVE 4 EGGS,
FRIED,
SOME STEW, AND I WANT
SOME STRONG TEA.
STRONG TEA. RIGHT.
UH, McCABE?
I'LL JUST HAVE MY DOUBLE
WHISKEY AND A RAW EGG.
RIGHT.
AND, SHEEHAN, GIVE ALL THEM
BOYS A DRINK ON ME.
YEAH.
HEY.
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE OUT
YOU'RE SUCH A FANCY DUDE,
YOU OUGHT
TO WEAR SOMETHING
BESIDES THAT CHEAP
JOCKEY CLUB COLOGNE.
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU THINK I AM.
ANOTHER ROUND?
JUST LISTEN, MR. McCABE,
I'M A WHORE,
AND I KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT WHOREHOUSES.
AND I KNOW THAT
IF YOU HAD A HOUSE UP HERE,
YOU'D STAND TO MAKE YOURSELF
A LOT OF MONEY.
NOW, THIS IS ALL YOU
GOT TO DO--PUT UP THE MONEY
FOR THE HOUSE.
I'LL DO ALL THE REST--
I'LL LOOK AFTER THE GIRLS,
THE BUSINESS, THE EXPENSES,
THE RUNNING,
THE FURNISHING, EVERYTHING.
AND I'LL PAY YOU BACK
ANY MONEY YOU PUT IN THE HOUSE,
SO'S YOU WON'T
LOSE NOTHIN'.
AND WE'LL MAKE IT 50-50.
UH, EXCUSE ME.
YOU KNOW, I ALREADY
GOT A WHOREHOUSE
OPERATIN' UP HERE.
YOU CAN'T CALL THEM
CRIB COWS WHORES.
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
A PROPER SPORTIN' HOUSE
WITH CLASS GIRLS
AND CLEAN LINEN
AND PROPER HYGIENE.
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
MY CLIENTELE UP HERE
TOO INTERESTED
IN THAT SORT OF THING.
THEY WILL BE ONCE
THEY GET A TASTE OF IT.
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
WITH SOMEONE UP HERE
TO HANDLE ALL THEM
PUNTERS PROPERLY,
YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF
AT LEAST DOUBLE THE MONEY
YOU MAKE ON YOUR OWN.
NOW,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I AIN'T THOUGHT
OF THAT ALREADY?
THEM TENTS, YOU KNOW,
THEY'S JUST TEMPORARY.
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
ONE GIRL FANCIES ANOTHER?
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN A GIRL
REALLY HAS HER MONTHLY
OR WHEN SHE'S JUST TAKIN'
A FEW DAYS OFF?
WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY
DON'T GET THEIR MONTHLIES,
'CAUSE THEY DON'T.
WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT SEEING TO THAT.
AND WHAT ABOUT CUSTOMERS?
WHO'S GONNA SKIN 'EM BACK
AND INSPECT 'EM?
YOU GONNA DO THAT?
WHAT--
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
THIS TOWN'LL BE CLAPPED UP
INSIDE OF 2 WEEKS
IF IT'S NOT ALREADY.
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN BUSINESS IS SLOW?
YOU GONNA JUST LET THE GIRLS
SIT AROUND ON THEIR BUMS?
'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MR. McCABE.
WHEN A GOOD WHORE GETS TIME
TO SIT AROUND AND THINK,
SHE'LL TURN TO RELIGION,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY WAS BORN WITH.
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF FILLIN'
THE BLOODY CHURCH DOWN THERE
INSTEAD OF
YOUR OWN POCKETS.
NOW, I HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF TIME
TO SIT AROUND AND TALK TO A MAN
WHO'S TOO DUMB TO SEE
A GOOD PROPOSITION
WHEN IT'S PUT TO HIM.
DO WE MAKE A DEAL,
OR DON'T WE?
HEH!
WELL?
SHIT.
I AIN'T TAKIN'
NO GODDAMN BATH.
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF I...
HMM.
KEEP IT ON THE--
WATCH THE LADDER.
THE LADDER'S ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS THE LAST
LOAD FOR ME.
YOU CAN SHOVE IT
UP YOUR ASS.
SHE'S BRINGIN' THEM GIRLS
ALL THE WAY FROM SEATTLE.
REAL FIRST-CLASS
FANCY WOMEN, I HEAR.
CAN'T IMAGINE
NOBODY PAYIN'
NO 25 CENTS
FOR A GODDAMN BATH.
CHEAPEST BATH IN BEARPAW
WAS 35 CENTS.
I WOULDN'T TAKE ONE

THEIR EYES,
THE WAY THEY SLANT,
AND THE WAY THEY
KICK UP AT THE SIDE?
THAT'S TRUE
FOR THEIR WHOLE...
THAT'S TRUE--
THAT'S TRUE
FOR THE REST
OF THEIR BODIES.
A FRIEND OF MINE,
AMOS LINDVEL,
DOWN IN SACRAMENTO,
CALIFORNIA,
HE ONCE SPENT $5.00
TO FIND OUT.
$5.00 JUST TO HAVE A LOOK.
HE SAID IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
A GUY LIKE AMOS LINDVEL
WASN'T GONNA SPEND $5.00
JUST TO FIND OUT
SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TRUE.
* BEAUTIFUL DREAMER *
* WAKE UNTO ME *
* LA LA LA LA LA LA LA *
I'M THE COOK NOW.
I'M NOT
A WHORE ANYMORE.
YOU'RE JUST THROWING AWAY
ALL THAT EXPERIENCE, LILY.
IT'S UNFAIR.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THIS PLACE
WHEN WE
GET IT FINISHED.
IT'S GONNA BE
REALLY NICE.
YOU KNOW, THE WHOREHOUSES
DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA
ARE REALLY UNUSUAL.
YOU WERE
DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA?
YES. I WAS DOWN THERE
WHEN I WAS A BOY.
THEY'RE REALLY
UNUSUAL WHORES.
THEY'RE NOT
LIKE THIS AT ALL.
THEY'RE NOT FANCY
AT ALL.
THEY'RE JUST
SORT OF MUD HUTS,
YOU KNOW?
MUD HOUSES.
YOU GET
A FAMILY OF PEOPLE
WORKING
IN THESE MUD HOUSES,
AND THE WOMEN IN THE
FAMILY ARE WHORES.
WHERE'S BERG? DO YOU
KNOW WHERE BERG IS?
HE'S IN THERE.
HAS HE HAD A BATH?
MADAM, I'M NOT HERE
AS A CUSTOMER.
BERG?
ARE YOU LOOKIN' FOR ME,
MR. McCABE?
ARE YOU TRYIN' TO PUT ME
OUT OF BUSINESS, BERG?
WELL, UH...
OH, THESE ORDER FORMS.
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
ALL RIGHT BECAUSE, UH...
HOW MUCH
IS THAT CHINESE?
$1.50.
DOES THAT GO FOR
MRS. MILLER, TOO?
SHE'S $5.00.
$5.00?
MAKE SURE YOU GET
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ORDERED.
THAT RIGHT,
MRS. MILLER?
WHAT'S THAT?
$5.00.
THAT'S RIGHT.
JESUS CHRIST.
AH, SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S GO.
YOU MUST BE RICH
OR SOMETHIN'.
IT'S IN YOUR OWN
BEST INTEREST
TO HAVE THESE FORMS
AND MAKE SURE
THEY'RE SIGNED.
HELLO, MR. QUIGLEY.
NOT SCARED OF ME,
ARE YOU?
...THAT YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU ORDERED,
THEN YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT PROOF.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
YOU'VE GOT MY SIGNATURE
ON THESE ORDER FORMS,
AND THAT'S
ALL YOU'D NEED.
WELL...
THAT'S IT.
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'D LIKE US TO STAY AROUND,
SEE IF MAYBE
SOMEONE DOESN'T--
NO, YOU GO AHEAD.
I GOTTA PUT THE RINGER
ON THESE BOOKS.
I CAN'T TELL THE GODDAMN
OWLS FROM THE CHICKENS.
* TRAVELIN' LADY *
* STAY A WHILE *
* UNTIL THE NIGHT
IS OVER *
* I'M JUST A STATION
ON YOUR WAY *
* I KNOW
I'M NOT YOUR LOVER *
AH, SHIT!
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
IN SUCH A LOUSY TEMPER?
BECAUSE,
MY DEAR MRS. MILLER,
I'VE NOT ONLY BUILT YOU
YOUR GOOSEBERRY RANCH,
I'VE PAID FOR A BATHHOUSE
I DON'T NEED.
I PAID
FOR TRANSPORTATION.
I PAID FOR TOWELS AND
LINENS AND ENEMA BAGS.
I PAID FOR THINGS
THEM CHIPPIES OF YOURS
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE,
BUT I HAVE NOT SOLD
A FULL BOTTLE OF WHISKEY
IN HERE TODAY,
AND THAT'S A FACT.
AND THAT,
MY DEAR MR. McCABE,
IS 'CAUSE EVERY GEEZER
IN THIS TOWN
WAS TAKIN' A BATH
IN YOUR BATHHOUSE
OR HAVIN' IT OFF WITH A GIRL
IN YOUR WHOREHOUSE.
WELL, I AIN'T SEEN
NONE OF THAT MONEY.
AND WHAT MY BOOKS TELL ME
I NEED MOST OF ALL
RIGHT NOW IS THE MONEY.
WHOREHOUSE
AND BATHHOUSE MONEY
FOR THE FIRST WEEK.
WE'RE A LITTLE SHORT
ON THE BATH MONEY
'CAUSE OF
THE FIRST NIGHT'S RUSH,
BUT I'LL SEE
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
HA HA HA!
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT
AND HOW MUCH YOU AIN'T.
YOU GOT YOUR
CREDIT COLUMN
ON A DIFFERENT PAGE
FROM YOUR DEBIT.
HEY, I'LL THANK YOU
TO KEEP YOUR LITTLE NOSE
OUT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S 14 FROM 23?
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
MY DEAR MADAM,
I CAN HOLD MY OWN
IN ANY GAME OF CHANCE
WITH ANY AMOUNT
YOU CAN COUNT.
AND I CAN FIGURE IT OUT
BEFORE YOU BLINK AN EYE.
AND DON'T GIVE ME
THEM HORSEPUCKIES
JUST 'CAUSE IT
TAKES ME A LITTLE TIME
TO WRITE IT UP FORMAL.
WELL, IF YOU'RE
SO BLOODY SMART,
THEN YOU KNOW
THAT IF WE WENT AHEAD
AND BOUGHT
THE WINDOWS AND DOORS
FOR THE WHOREHOUSE,
WE'D MAKE TWICE
AS MUCH MONEY.
OR PERHAPS YOU LIKE
THE IDEA OF SCREWIN'
WITH THE WIND WHISTLIN'
UP YOUR KHYBER!
WHENEVER YOU TALK
ABOUT SPENDIN' MONEY,
YOU SAY "WE."
I SAY "WE," MR. McCABE,
BECAUSE
YOU THINK SMALL.
YOU THINK SMALL
'CAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID TO THINK BIG.
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
YOU HAVE TO SPEND
MONEY TO MAKE MONEY.
YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
SHUFFLIN' CARDS
IN THIS DUMP, FINE.
I DON'T.
THERE'S GONNA
COME A TIME--
THERE'S GONNA COME A TIME
WHEN I GO TO ME HOME
IN FRISCO--SAN FRANCISCO--
AND BUY ME A LEGITIMATE
BOARDINGHOUSE,
BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT
THOSE SMALL-TIMERS
SCREWING UP ME BUSINESS.
BOARDINGHOUSE, HUH?
LIKE TO GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THEM BOARDERS.
HEY!
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE OFF TO?
MONEY AND PAIN.
PAIN, PAIN.
HEY, AL,
LOOK AT THIS.
HEY, HON, YOU WORK

AND HE SAYS,
"HEY, EAGLE!" HE SAYS,
"OH," HE SAYS,
"HOW HIGH UP ARE WE?"
AND THE EAGLE SAYS,
"WELL, WE'RE UP
ABOUT A MILE, 2 MILES."
AND--AND THE FROG SAYS,
HE SAYS, "WELL, UH,

SHIT ME NOW, WOULD YOU?"
HEY, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S

THAT YOU GENTLEMEN
COME UP HERE,
AND YOU, UH...YOU WANT
A MAN IN MY POSITION
TO SELL OFF
HIS PROPERTY,
AND, UH, I THINK THERE'S

YOU'LL FIND THAT OUT.
HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL GO?
WELL...
TOMORROW MORNING
AT BREAKFAST

TELL THE TALE.
YOU'RE A FUNNY
LITTLE THING.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE
JUST THE SWEETEST.
AND THEN
OTHER TIMES, I--
* I'M JUST A STATION
ON YOUR WAY *
* I KNOW
I'M NOT YOUR LOVER *
* SHE USED TO WEAR
HER HAIR LIKE YOU *
* EXCEPT
WHEN SHE WAS SLEEPIN' *
* AND THEN SHE'D WEAVE IT
ON A LOOM *
* OF SMOKE AND GOLD
AND DREAMIN' *
LISTEN, YOU WANT TO MAKE
A DEAL. ALL RIGHT?
WE ONLY HAVE TO COME UP

WELL, 6,250.
I DON'T THINK SO.
HE HASN'T
THE BRAINS.
I'M GONNA TURN IT
OVER TO JAKE.
OH, COME ON, LET'S NOT
GIVE UP ON HIM NOW.
NOW, LISTEN, SOCK,
IF YOU WANT TO
HANG AROUND HERE
AND TRY AND KNOCK
SOME SENSE
INTO THAT FOOL'S HEAD,
THAT'S UP TO YOU.
I'M GOIN' BACK.
RIGHT NOW.
AFTER 17 YEARS,
I THINK I DESERVE
SOMETHING BETTER
THAN BEING SENT OUT
ON A GODDAMN SNIPE
HUNT LIKE THIS.
HE'S IMPOSSIBLE.
YEAH, OK. I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE TRIED.
LISTEN, YOU THINK
THAT MEAT WAS ALL RIGHT?
HOPE IT WASN'T RANCID.
THAT'S ALL I NEED
ON A TRIP LIKE THIS
IS A CASE OF THE RUNS.
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU?
WELL, HOW IS HE?
TERRIBLE.
HE'S OUT AGAIN.
DIDN'T COME THROUGH
AGAIN THIS TIME
FOR 3 HOURS.
JESUS CHRIST.
WELL, BART COYLE WENT AND GOT
HIS HEAD BASHED OPEN LAST NIGHT.
YEAH? HOW IS HE?
HORRIBLE.
HE KEEPS
PASSIN' OUT.
I THINK
HE CRACKED IT.
HEY, ROBBY, I WANT YOU TO
BREAK OUT ONE OF THEM JARS
OF DAMSON PRESERVES I GOT
SENT UP HERE FROM PORTLAND.
GIVE HIM ANOTHER DRINK.
DIDN'T I SAY THERE
WAS THREE FOR BREAKFAST?
SMALLEY SAID THE OTHERS
WEREN'T COMIN'.
THOSE OTHER TWO,
THEY LEFT LAST NIGHT.
OH, YOU HANDLED THEM
BEAUTIFULLY.
THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'T
DEALIN' WITH NO TINHORN.
ALMIGHTY GOD IN HEAVEN
WHO SEES AND KNOWS
ALL THE SINFUL ACTS
OF THOSE THAT OFFEND
HIM ON THIS EARTH,
THE SWIFT AND POWERFUL
BLADE OF JUSTICE
LAYS OPEN
THE SERPENT OF EVIL
AND LEAVES HIS PUTRID FLESH
TO ROT
UNDER THE SUN OF HEAVEN
AND SENDS ITS SOUL
TO BURN FOREVER
IN HELL'S FIRE.
ACCEPT THE TOIL
OF THIS SERVANT
AS ATONEMENT
FOR HIS SINS
AND GRANT HIM ENTRANCE
INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
AND EVERLASTING LIFE
AT THE FOOT OF THE
ALMIGHTY THRONE. AMEN.
* A CALM
AND UNDISTURBED REPOSE *
* UNBROKEN
BY THE LAST OF FOES *
* I'LL SLEEP IN JESUS *
* OH, HOW SWEET TO BE
FOR SUCH A SLUMBER MEET *

HIDING PLACE *

YOU'RE NOT GOIN'
DOWN THERE, ARE YOU?
AIN'T NOTHIN'
TO WORRY ABOUT.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

DO YOU FANCY?
AW, HELL, DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE.
I GOTTA HAVE YOU ALL.
HOT DAMN.
HAHA HA HA HA!
BLANCHE, THE MAIL
COME IN TODAY.
THIS HERE
IS FOR MRS. MILLER.
OH, THAT MUST BE THE NEW
PETTICOAT SHE ORDERED.
OH, HI. BOY, THEY SURE WEREN'T
KIDDIN' ABOUT THIS PLACE.
WHAT'S THAT? IS THAT
A LETTER FOR ME?
UH...
THAT'S FOR ME.
I'LL JUST TAKE THIS
ON UP TO MRS. MILLER.
MR. McCABE...
SHE'S GOT COMPANY.
WELL, I'LL JUST
LEAVE IT HERE.
WELL, IT JUST
HURTS SO MUCH.
I GUESS MAYBE
I'M...SMALL?
NAH. YOU GOT TO LEARN
TO RELAX, THAT'S ALL.
I THINK--YEAH,
MAYBE THIS WILL DO.
STAND UP.
TAKE YOUR TOP OFF.
YOU GOTTA TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF IT,
THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE.
YEAH?
LOOK AT A WALL,
COUNT THE ROSES
ON THE WALLPAPER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
THERE'S NOTHIN' TO HIDE.
SEE, THE THING IS,
IT DON'T MEAN NOTHIN'.
YOU NEVER KNOW,
YOU MIGHT EVEN
GET TO LIKE IT.
I MEAN,
YOU MANAGED IT
WITH BART,
DIDN'T YOU? HEY?
OH, YEAH, YOU REALLY
ARE SMALL, AREN'T YOU?
JUST LIKE ME.
I'LL GET A FEW PINS.
OH, BUT WITH HIM,
I HAD TO.
IT WAS MY DUTY.
TURN AROUND.
IT WEREN'T
YOUR DUTY, EITHER.
YOU DID IT TO PAY
FOR YOUR BED AND BOARD.
YOU DO THIS TO PAY FOR
YOUR BED AND BOARD, TOO,
ONLY YOU KEEP A LITTLE
EXTRA FOR YOURSELF,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ASK NOBODY FOR NOTHIN',
WHICH IS MORE HONEST,
TO MY MIND.
DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE
GONNA DO JUST FINE HERE.
A DOLLAR.
OK, I'LL BUMP
YOU A DOLLAR.
MAKE IT 5.
YOU GOT IT.
OK. I'LL
CALL YOU.
OH, SHIT,
YOU LITTLE FART.
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKIN'
AT MY DAMN CARDS.
NO, IT'S JUST YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO BET.
ANYBODY COULD TELL
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
DEAL THIS HAND FOR ME.
McCABE, WEBSTER'S GOIN'
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN TODAY
IN HIS WAGON.
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ME?
AW, JESUS,
THERE'S STILL TIME
TO GET IN
ON THAT BOOM
AROUND PORT MOODY.
SHE SAYS
THAT YOU CAN HAVE
A NEW BUSINESS THERE
FOR NO MONEY AT ALL.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
GO OUT THERE FIRST
AND HAVE A LOOK.
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
TODAY WITH WEBSTER--
I'M YOUR PARTNER.
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME.
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNIN'
TO DO ABOUT THEM BLOKES?
BLOKES? TALKIN' ABOUT
THEM BOYS UP THERE?
SMALLEY'S UP THERE
TALKIN' TO 'EM NOW.
HE'S GONNA
BRING 'EM DOWN,
AND I'M GONNA MAKE
A DEAL WITH 'EM.
WHAT IF THEY
DON'T MAKE A DEAL?
WELL, THEN I WON'T MAKE
A DEAL WITH 'EM.
I'LL JUST HAVE A DRINK.
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN
ME IN A DRINK?
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
WORRY WHAT PEOPLE THINK.
THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW.
WEBSTER'S COVERED
HIS WAGON NOW.
HE FOUND ALL THIS CANVAS, AND
AND HE JUST COVERED HIS WAGON.
HE--HE'S COVERED HIS WAGON,
AND NO ONE WOULD EVEN--
ANYWAY, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
HAVE TO ANSWER TO ANYONE FOR?
I MEAN, YOU BLOODY WELL
OWN THIS TOWN, DON'T YOU?
I APPRECIATE YOU
WORRYIN' ABOUT ME.
I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT THERE AIN'T NOTHIN'
TO BE SCARED OF.
I TELL YOU,
THEY THE ONES THAT GOT
TO MAKE A DEAL, NOT ME.
I FEEL SORRY FOR 'EM.
THEM OLD GUFFERS
BEEN WORKIN'
THIS COMPANY 20 YEARS.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO, AND THE COMPANY SAYS
GET ON UP THERE AND
MAKE A DEAL WITH McCABE
AND DON'T COME BACK
TILL YOU DONE IT.
AND, HELL, WHEN THEY COME
UPSIDE A MULE LIKE ME,
I FEEL SORRY FOR 'EM,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
I DO. I REALLY DO.
I FEEL SORRY FOR 'EM.
I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOIN'.
I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOIN'.
WHAT'S HE CARRYIN' THAT BLOODY
BLUNDERBUSS WITH HIM FOR, THEN?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE COME
UP HERE TO HUNT POSSUM.
YOU WANT
A DRINK OR NOT?
THEY SAID THERE WAS
NOTHIN' TO TALK ABOUT.
WHO'S HERE?
HIS NAME'S BUTLER.
THE SON OF A BITCH
MUST BE 7 FEET TALL.
WELL, UH, YOU INVITE 'EM DOWN
HERE FOR A MEAL OR...OR, UH...
YEAH, BUT THEY SAID
THEY WERE GONNA
EAT AT SHEEHAN'S.
SMALLEY, GIVE ME 4 OR 5
OF THEM STOGIES, WILL YA?
LISTEN, THEY'D MAKE
A DEAL IF HE WANTED TO.
THEY GET PAID FOR
KILLIN', NOTHIN' ELSE.
McCABE, YOU'VE GOT TO
GO OVER AND STOP--
THANK YOU, SMALLEY.
GO DOWN TO THE WAGON.
I'LL TELL EVERYBODY
YOU GOT BUSINESS.
I'LL TELL 'EM
YOU'VE GOT BUSINESS
WITH THE COMPANY,
IF YOU LIKE.
WELL, I GUESS IF
A MAN'S FOOL ENOUGH
TO GET IN BUSINESS
WITH A WOMAN,
SHE AIN'T GONNA
THINK MUCH OF HIM.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE WEALTH OF THIS TOWN IS.
CHINKYVILLE,
THAT'S WHERE IT IS,
RIGHT DOWN THERE
IN CHINATOWN.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.
UP IN CANADA, RIGHT NOW,
THEY'RE BLASTING TUNNEL
UNDER $10 A FOOT,
ALL DONE WITH A PIGTAIL.
THEY GOT SOME
NEW EXPLOSIVES UP THERE,
FANTASTIC STUFF.
THEY GIVE IT
TO JOHNNY CHINAMAN,
SEND HIM IN,
DOWN COMES
AND ONE DEAD CHINAMAN.
AND, YOU, SIR, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE FINE IS
FOR KILLING A CHINAMAN?
$50, MAXIMUM.
THE INSPECTOR'S WORKING
FOR THE COMPANY.
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.
YOU COULD DO THIS RIGHT
HERE WITH YOUR OWN ZINC.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS TO GIVE THE BUGGER
A BOX OF THIS STUFF,
PUT HIM DOWN THE HOLE,
UP TO THE ROCK FACE,
AND THERE'S YOUR ZINC--
UH, YOU MUST
BE BUTLER, HUH?
SIR?
WELL,
I'M JOHN McCABE.
I THINK WE GOT
BUSINESS TO TALK OVER.
DO YOU SMOKE CIGARS?
YES, I DO.
HAVE ONE OF MINE.
OH, THANK YOU.
HMM.
UH, SHALL WE
STEP IN THE BAR?
WE CAN GET
A LITTLE PRIVACY.
NO. WE'RE FINE HERE.
SHEEHAN, SET UP A BOTTLE
ON ME, WILL YOU?
BOTTLE.
UH, ABOUT THAT DEAL.
YOU KNOW, UH, WHEN THEM, UH,
WHEN THEM GENTLEMEN COME UP HERE
AND MAKE ME THAT OFFER,
THERE WAS JUST
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS
WE DIDN'T TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION.
HOW MUCH DID
THEY OFFER YOU?
WELL, UH...
UH, $5,500.
WELL, THEY COME UP
SO THAT'S, UH, THAT'S
UH...
YEAH, BUT HOW MUCH
DID YOU ASK THEM?
UH, WE NEVER
GOT AROUND TO THAT
'CAUSE, UH...I--
OH, WELL,
I MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
SOMETHIN' LIKE
$12, $10,000,
BUT THAT WAS JUST TO GET 'EM
BARGAININ', YOU KNOW, AND, UH,
AND TO, UH, WELL, JUST
SO'S THEY'D TALK SENSE.
YEAH, BUT HOW MUCH
DID YOU REALLY WANT?
UH, WELL,
UH, THAT DEPENDS.
I MEAN, THEY--
THEY TALKED ABOUT
ALL MY HOLDINGS.
UM...
$8,000.
UH, 7,500
PROBABLY MORE LIKELY,
MORE RIGHT.
YOU WEREN'T VERY
FAR APART, WERE YOU?
OH, HELL, NO. THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYIN' TO TELL YOU, YOU SEE,
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY MEAN
BY ALL MY HOLDINGS.
I MEAN, UH, ALL MY HOLDINGS.
DOES THAT MEAN, UH, MY HORSES,
MY CLOTHES, MY UNDERWEAR?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY...
UH, WELL, THE FACT IS,
SHIT, I'D BE WILLIN'
TO MAKE A DEAL FOR 6,250
IF THEY DON'T COUNT MY
PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THAT.
I MEAN, THAT'S PROVIDED
THAT THEY, UH, THEY BUY
MY INVENTORY SEPARATE.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
WELL, 350...
AND THEN--SO YOU
GOT, UH, THE 300
AND 6,250.
SO THAT'S, UH, UH...
WELL, LET'S JUST
MAKE THAT AN EVEN 6,500,
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL.
I DON'T MAKE DEALS.
UH...WELL,
WHAT YOU DOIN' UP HERE
IF YOU DON'T MAKE DEALS?
I CAME UP HERE
TO HUNT BEAR.
I HEAR IT'S VERY
GOOD AROUND HERE.
UH...
BEAR.
HA HA HA!
UH, UH, YOU DON'T WORK
FOR HARRISON SHAUGHNESSY?
SOMETIMES.
ONLY WHEN THEY
CAN'T MAKE A DEAL.
LOOK, THAT'S JUST WHAT
I'M TRYIN' TO TELL YOU.
THIS HERE DEAL
CAN BE MADE.
NOT WITH ME.
OH.
HMM.
WELL, I GUESS
WHAT I GOT TO DO
IS, UH, GET IN TOUCH
WITH THIS FELLOW SEARS.
I'LL SEE YOU BOYS LATER.
McCABE.
WERE YOU EVER
CALLED "PUDGY"?
A LONG TIME AGO. WHY?
MY BEST FRIEND'S
BEST FRIEND
WAS BILL ROUNDTREE.
DID YOU KILL HIM?
I WAS IN A POKER GAME
WHEN HE GOT SHOT,
BUT, UH...I DIDN'T KILL HIM.
ARE YOU CALLIN'
HIS BEST FRIEND A LIAR?
WAIT A MINUTE. I AIN'T
CALLIN' NOBODY A LIAR.
BILL ROUNDTREE GOT CAUGHT
MARKIN' THE QUEENS.
HE WENT FOR HIS GUN,
AND HE GOT SHOT, THAT'S ALL.
I'M GONNA COUNT 10.
IF YOU'RE NOT
ON THAT BRIDGE
BY THE TIME
I'M FINISHED,
I'M GONNA GET
VERY CROSS WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
I JUST, UH...I JUST
WANT YOU BOYS TO KNOW
THAT I AIN'T
WEARIN' NO GUN.
PATTY.
COME HERE.
WHO THE HELL WAS
THIS BILL ROUNDTREE?
WELL, UH...
HE WAS REAL
WELL-KNOWN.
I MEAN, WHO SAID
HE SHOT HIM?
I TOLD YOU,
EVERYBODY SAID
HE SHOT HIM WITH
A DERRINGER.
THAT MAN?
THAT MAN
NEVER KILLED ANYBODY.
ALL THE TIME,
MAKIN' ME FEEL
LIKE I'M GONNA MAKE
A FOOL OUT OF MYSELF.
WELL,
NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE
WHO THE FOOLS IS.
SON OF A BITCHES.
I NEVER DID FIT
IN THIS GODDAMN TOWN.
GOD, I HATE
WHEN THEM BASTARDS
PUT THEIR HANDS ON YOU.
I TELL YOU, SOMETIMES...
SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TAKIN'
A LOOK AT YOU,
I JUST KEEP
LOOKIN' AND A-LOOKIN'.
I WANT TO FEEL YOUR LITTLE
BODY UP AGAINST ME SO BAD
I THINK I'M GONNA BUST.
AND I KEEP
TRYIN' TO TELL YOU
IN A LOT
OF DIFFERENT WAYS...
IF, JUST ONE TIME,
YOU COULD BE SWEET
WITHOUT NO MONEY AROUND.
I THINK I COULD--
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHIN'.
I GOT POETRY IN ME.
I DO. I GOT POETRY IN ME,
BUT...I AIN'T GONNA
PUT IT DOWN ON PAPER.
I AIN'T NO EDUCATED MAN.
I GOT SENSE ENOUGH
NOT TO TRY.
CAN'T NEVER SAY
NOTHIN' TO YOU.
IF YOU JUST ONE TIME
LET ME
RUN THE SHOW, I'D--
YOU'RE JUST
FREEZIN' MY SOUL,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'.
FREEZIN' MY SOUL.
WELL, SHIT.
ENJOY YOURSELF, GIRL.
JUST GO AHEAD
AND HAVE A TIME.
WHAT THE HELL.
IT'S JUST MY LUCK
ONLY WOMAN THAT'S EVER
BEEN ONE TO ME
AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A WHORE.
BUT WHAT THE HELL, I NEVER
WAS A PERCENTAGE MAN.
I SUPPOSE A WHORE'S
ONLY KIND OF WOMAN I'D KNOW.
UH, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
UM, UH, IS THIS FELLOW
EUGENE SEARS STILL HERE?
NO. HE LEFT
THIS MORNIN'.
MM-HMM. UH, ANOTHER
FELLOW WAS WITH HIM,
UH, BY NAME OF, UH, ERNIE.
MR. HOLLANDER.
HOLLANDER.
THAT'S RIGHT. UH...
I WONDER IF
HE'S STILL HERE.
NO. HE WENT WITH HIM.
WELL, THANK YOU
ALL THE SAME.
THE LAW IS HERE
TO PROTECT THE LITTLE GUY
LIKE YOURSELF, McCABE,
AND I'M AT YOUR SERVICE
FREE OF CHARGE.
FREE?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAY ME ANYTHING.
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR
FOR THE NEXT SENATOR
FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
TO BE YOUR SERVANT
BEFORE THE SCALES
OF JUSTICE.
THAT'S, UH, MIGHTY
DECENT OF YOU.
WHEN A MAN, McCABE...
WHEN A MAN GOES
INTO THE WILDERNESS
AND WITH HIS BARE HANDS
GIVES BIRTH
TO A SMALL ENTERPRISE,
NOURISHES IT,
AND TENDS IT
WHILE IT GROWS,
WELL, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT NO DIRTY SONS OF BITCHES
ARE GONNA TAKE IT
AWAY FROM HIM.
NOW, AIN'T THAT
RIGHT?
WELL, I--
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT'S RIGHT.
NOW, YOU TAKE
THAT THERE COMPANY--
HARRISON SHAUGHNESSY.
THEY HAVE STOCKHOLDERS.
NOW, DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT
THEIR STOCKHOLDERS
AND THE PUBLIC
THINKIN' THAT THEIR
MANAGEMENT ISN'T IMBUED
WITH ALL THE PRINCIPLES
OF FAIR PLAY AND JUSTICE,
THE VERY VALUES THAT MAKE
THIS COUNTRY WHAT IT IS TODAY?
UH-HUH.
BUSTIN' UP THESE
TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES
IS AT THE VERY ROOT
OF THE PROBLEM
OF CREATING
A JUST SOCIETY.
DAMN IT, McCABE,
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS FREE ENTERPRISE
SYSTEM OF OURS WORKS,
AND WORKING WITHIN IT,
WE CAN PROTECT
THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN
AND THE BIG BUSINESSMAN
AS WELL.
WELL, YEAH.
I--I JUST DIDN'T, UH,
DIDN'T WANT TO GET KILLED.
UNTIL PEOPLE
STOP DYIN' FOR FREEDOM,
THEY AIN'T
GONNA BE FREE.
I CAN SEE IT NOW
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE
RIGHT NEXT TO A PICTURE
OF WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN--
"McCABE STRIKES A BLOW
FOR THE LITTLE GUY."
OH, COME...
YOU'RE GONNA BECOME
A FAMOUS MAN, McCABE.
WE COULD FIND OURSELVES
HAVIN' DINNER
WITH WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
WELL, I--
YOU'RE GONNA BE A HERO.
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE GONNA
STARE 'EM DOWN
AND MAKE THEM
QUAKE IN THEIR BOOTS.
MM-HMM.
WELL...
WHA-WHAT DO WE DO?
WE GET THE MARSHAL
AND, UH...
NO?
WE DON'T NEED
THE MARSHAL.
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
THROUGH THE COURTS.
WELL, THEN, UH, I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'
IS THAT, UH, WE GET THIS
THING IN THE PAPERS,
IN THE COURTS, AND
ALL THAT, THAT, UH...
WELL, THEY JUST
CAN'T AFFORD TO KILL ME.
IS, UH, THAT RIGHT?
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO LIFT
ONE LITTLE FINGER AGAINST YOU.
COMES A TIME
IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE,
CONSTANCE,
WHEN HE'S JUST GOT
TO STICK HIS HAND
IN THE FIRE
AND, UH...
AND, UH, SEE WHAT
HE'S MADE OUT OF.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
BUSTIN' UP THESE TRUSTS
AND MONOPOLIES, THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.
SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO PROTECT
THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN
FROM THESE BIG COMPANIES,
AND I'M GONNA
BE THE MAN.
CONSTANCE, JUST 'CAUSE WE
AIN'T NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT
DON'T MEAN I AIN'T GOT,
UH, CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.
I KNOW IT DON'T MEAN
NOTHIN' TO YOU,
BUT I GOT A REPUTATION
IN THIS TOWN. THESE P--
WHAT'S PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH TO YOU?
YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO SELL OUT!
JUST SELL OUT
AND GO SOMEPLACE
WHERE PEOPLE
ARE CIVILIZED.
THEY'LL GET YOU, McCABE.
THEY'LL GET YOU,
AND THEY'LL DO
SOMETHIN' AWFUL TO YOU.
NOW, NOW,
LITTLE LADY.
AIN'T NOTHIN'
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.
DON'T GIVE ME ANY
OF THAT "LITTLE LADY" SHIT.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME MY $1,500.
I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL,
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
A DEAL WITH 'EM, THEN
I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH 'EM!
EAT YOUR MEAL.
YOU CAN'T MAKE NO DEAL.
BYE.
BYE, HONEY.
GONNA MISS YA.
YEAH, I'M GONNA
MISS YOU, TOO.
BE A GOOD BOY.
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF.
I WILL. BYE.
SAY BYE TO
MRS. MILLER FOR ME.
OK. GOOD-BYE.
SHE'S AMAZING.
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF.
BE CAREFUL.
OH, YEAH.
COME BACK.
BYE, COWBOY.
COME BACK.
I WILL.
IT'S SHORTY.
COME ON IN.
BYE, COWBOY!
I WASN'T TRYIN'
TO HIT IT.
THE TRICK IS
NOT TO HIT IT,
BUT TO MAKE IT
FLOAT.
HEY, HOLD IT, SONNY.
WHAT?
HOLD UP ON YOUR TARGET
PRACTICE A MINUTE.
I DON'T WANT
TO GET SHOT.
WELL, THEN GET
OFF THE BRIDGE,
YOU SADDLE TRAMP.
I WANT TO BUY
SOME SOCKS.
I GOT A LONG RIDE
AHEAD OF ME.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE SOCKS YOU GOT ON?
I WORE 'EM OUT
RUNNIN' AROUND HALF NAKED
IN THAT WHOREHOUSE
OVER THERE.
THAT'S REALLY QUITE A PLACE.
YOU BEEN THERE YET?
TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS
AND SHOW ME.
OH, YOU'RE JOSHIN' ME.
I SAID TAKE OFF
YOUR BOOTS
AND SHOW ME,
YOU EGG SUCKER.
I AIN'T GONNA DO THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARIN'
THAT GUN FOR?
NOTHIN'.
I JUST WEAR IT.
CAN'T HIT NOTHIN'
WITH IT.
WELL, THAT DON'T
MAKE NO SENSE.
WHAT KIND OF GUN
IS IT?
COLT.
THEM'S GOOD GUNS.
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.
MUST BE SOMETHIN'
WRONG WITH IT.
NAH, IT'S ME. I JUST
CAN'T SHOOT GOOD.
WELL, LET ME SEE IT.
COME ON. MAYBE I
CAN FIX IT FOR YOU.
OK.
CONSTANCE.
YOU'RE THE BEST-LOOKIN'
WOMAN I EVER SAW,
AND I AIN'T NEVER TRIED
TO DO NOTHIN'
BUT PUT A SMILE
ON YOUR FACE.
I AIN'T NO GOOD
AT SAYIN' I'M SORRY.
I, UH...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I GUESS I AIN'T
NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE
TO NOBODY BEFORE.
HEY.
WHY DON'T YOU GET
UNDER THE COVERS?
HUH?
CONSTANCE--
YEAH, YEAH. YOU DON'T
NEED TO SAY NOTHIN'.
I'M SORRY.
HEY...
COME ON.
