If I'm not troubling you...
...I think I need to get some water for my horse.
Where do you come from?
Coahuila.
What brings you in Texas?
- I'm looking for a job? - What kind of job?
I'm a cowboy.
- Sister! Pepe! - Run Marianna, run!
Put your hands on your head.
- How many calves left? - 120.
That's a shitload.
- When is the boss coming back
from Houston? -Saturday afternoon.
Fucking mama's boy.
He says he is a rancher just
because they bought him this ranch...
But I never seen him out here working hard.
You're just mad because the only
woman you ever had is your hand.
Let's go to Midland this Saturday.
The border patrol will nab me in Midland.
Bullshit. Are you scared of women or what?
Augustin, close the goddamn gate.
- You like it? - It's the best horse I've ever seen.
- If you like him, he's yours. - Yeah, right.
Really. Take him.
But it's your horse.
Mine, yours... What's the difference?
This horse got "Pedro" branded in his brain.
It's yours.
No, it must have costed you a fortune.
Bullshit... It's yours now. Don't even get off of him.
Relax.
The border patrol is everywhere.
- It's fine man, don't worry. - Where are you going?
Where do you think? To get the girls.
Hurry up.
- That's Bob's wife from the cate, right? - Yes genius!
- But she is married. - So is the other one.
Your room is 205.
See you in three hours.
Only one hour.
Yes, sure.
- Music? - Ah, music, yes.
Crazy bitches.
Let's go.
Are you ok?
Are you ok?
He killed Melquiades Estrada.
The oldest is Elizabeth. She must be 14 now.
The other one is Yesenia, she is probably 12.
And this is my little son Aaron.
He's going to be a good cowboy.
And this one...
...is Evelia.
Evelia Camargo, my wife...
Wnen was the last time you saw them?
About... 5 years ago.
Promise me one thing, Pedro.
If I die here...
carry me back to my family...
...and bury me in my hometown.
I don't wanna get buried among the fuckin' billboards.
I'll die before you, I'm older.
Promise me!
We are here, right?
Move down to Ojinaga and head South.
Then turn East, and follow the sierra until you find Coahuila.
Then you'll get in a town called "El Toston".
...is a little place called "Jimenez".
There's my home.
Go and find Evelia, my wife, and explain her.
I'll just throw you in the trash.
You'll take me back to Jimenez Pedro...
You promised.
Good morning.
- Watch out, a rattlesnake! It's not gonna bite anyone.
A dead man!
Get him out.
He's still breathing.
- I think that snake bit him. - Sure did.
Is he a "gringo"?
- He looks too dirty for a gringo. - Does he have any money?
I think it's too late for him.
Take it easy. I'm a friend.
Yes.
Tomas, go with them. I'll take the gringo to get cured.
Ok, deal.
The fucking gringo bit me.
- Dona Adriana, is Mariana at home? - Yes she's here.
What's going on?
Is he the one who got bit by the snake?
Get this gringo out of here. He's the one who broke my nose.
Are you sure?
Hell yes, you can't forget a white rat's face.
- He'll probably die. - Let him die.
Please...
Heal him.
Why?
Because...
...I need him alive.
Is he gonna get better?
From the poison, yes...
but if he gets gangrene, we'll have to cut off his foot.
Your call is ready.
At the farm Los Lombos, the city Ojinaga, Chihuahua of Mexico.
The asshole gringo woke up.
- Is there hot coffee? - I just made some.
Bring me the pot.
Now we're even asshole.
You wanna help us?
- You want some coffee? - Yes sir. Please.
Come sit with us.
Sit down.
- Do you have any food to sell us? - Food? I'll give you for free.
We have fresh meat.
Take as much as you want.
We had to kill it.
This damn bear was killing too many goats.
- Is this Coahuila? - Yes you are in Coahuila.
Do you know how to get to El Toston?
When you reach the sierra, head South and you'll get there.
What do they say on the TV?
Take it...
...for the pain.
- How much? - 20 pesos.
Do you know of any place called Jimenez?
No, none.
Manuel... you ever heard of Jimenez?
A little...
I don't know anyone called Melquiades.
- Where did you find a picture of me
and my kids. - Melquiades gave it to me.
Don't say stupid things.
You're gonna get me in trouble with my husband, Javier Martinez.
We don't know any Melquiades.
I'm sorry miss, I didn't want to offend you.
But he was my friend.
Go see Don Casimiro.
He knows everyone who passed through this town.
Maybe he can help you.
I am sure.
It doesn't exist.
Why?
Jimenez is a beautiful place.
It's between two hills.
The air is clean there...
...you feel like you can hug the mountains with your arms.
A stream with clear, fresh water bubbles up right out of the rocks.
If you go to Jimenez...
I swear to you, your heart will break with so much beauty.
Ask Melquiades for forgiveness.
