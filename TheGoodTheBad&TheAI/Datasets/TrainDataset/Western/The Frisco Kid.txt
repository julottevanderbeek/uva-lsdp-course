With the Indians!
Avram !
I want to talk to you in private.
Speak only English.
And no matter what I say, don't smile.
Out of 88 students graduating
from this yeshiva...
you came in a close 87.
Don't smile.
Look sad.
There is a new congregation...
In America?
Wait!
Some meshuggener suggested your
name to become the new rabbi.
I am forced to take an official
vote of the board of rabbis.
Close.
It's a close vote.
But I am the Chief Rabbi!
I am the one who has to decide!
So, cowboy...
I am sending you to San Francisco.
- Where is San Francisco?
- By New York.
Get out, quick.
And so, on a wonderful
sunny day in 1850...
the city where all the
brothers love each other...
The boat's gone.
Understand?
Somebody should have told us!
This is the devil's work.
- What'd he say?
- Says the boat is gone.
Mister, what'd you just say
about the boat to San Francisco?
- Gone!
- Well, that can't be.
That boat's supposed to leave
first tide in the morning!
Supposed to?
What the hell's the matter with you?
It's a gold rush.
Haven't you people heard anything?
- Next boat two months.
- Oh, God!
Oh, my God, help me!
Just this morning me and
my brother got the news.
All right. Who's next?
Our mama's dying in San Francisco.
What am I gonna do?
There must be some way that a
person can go to San Francisco...
in another way than the boat.
Not for us, sir.
Just 10 minutes ago, me and my brother
sold our horses and our wagon...
so as we could purchase
tickets on this here boat.
And now we ain't got neither.
Well, perhaps if you go to the man...
and you told him your troubles
and you give him back the money...
he would give you back the wagon.
You think he'll do it?
If he is a good man, I
think he would do that, yes.
Mister, would you help me, please?
I'm not much good at
explaining myself and...
I usually just start to cry.
I will do that.
I would be happy to do it.
But I don't know if I
would be much help to you.
Wait, you don't have
to carry the bags.
My brother, his name is Matt.
- Oh, say, what's your name?
- Avram.
Avram. My name's Darryl, Darryl Diggs.
Anyway, my brother's got a temper.
Sometimes he just unloads,
you know what I mean?
- Can't I help you to carry...
- No, that's all right.
I've got it all. Don't
worry about a thing.
Just step in here, anyway. Come
on, what is it again, Avrum?
Avram. But you didn't
do nothing wrong.
- Everything go all right?
- Well, we missed the boat.
- What?
- The boat sailed yesterday.
The whole town's gone crazy, Matt.
It's gold rush. It sailed yesterday.
Yeah, but what are
we supposed to do now?
Well, God may be on our side yet,
Matt, thanks to this here gentleman.
Avram, this is my
brother, Matthew Diggs.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Jones!
Mr. Jones, we missed our boat and we
find ourselves in a desperate state.
We need our horses
and our wagon back...
so as we can get to San Francisco
to see our mum before she dies.
So if you'd be kind enough
to take your money back...
I sympathize with your misfortunes,
fellows. But you've got to understand...
I'm in the business of
buying and selling...
and I don't sell unless
I can make a profit.
But we don't have no
money to give you a profit.
Then we don't do no business.
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
How much profit do you
need from these gentlemen?
$50.
$50. That's it, Matt, we're sunk.
I'm sorry, Avram. Sorry
I wasted your time.
Well, perhaps I could pay the $50.
It's real kind of you, Avram.
I don't know how's we could
ever pay you back. Do you, Matt?
$50, look, I don't know.
If I could have a seat on
your wagon to San Francisco...
I would be more than paid back.
Well, you pay the $50...
you could have a seat with a
cushion on it. Can't he, Matt?
All the way.
I would share the cushion.
Matt, the Lord is smiling
on you and me today!
Amen.
Gentlemen, quiet!
Wonderful, marvelous news.
Just this morning, I
received this letter.
"Dear Mr. Bender:
"This is to inform you
that soon, God willing...
"you will have a rabbi and a Torah.
"Rabbi Avram Belinski
has left Poland...
"to join you in the
village of San Francisco.
"Avram thanks you for the
picture of your lovely family.
"He is looking eagerly forward to
meeting your daughter Sarah Mindl...
"with an eye towards matrimony."
- Papa !
- Not now, Sarah Mindl.
But, Julius!
Go to your room.
What's the matter with Sarah Mindl?
Bender, a rabbi is
better than a Rosensheine.
You want a bite?
Oh, thanks.
There she is, Avram.
That little shortcut I
was telling you about.
Gonna get us to San
Francisco four days earlier.
Good.
Whoa !
What happened? Is it Indians?
Mr. Jones, what's happening?
Darryl, tell him I paid the $50!
He paid the $50.
- You paid the $50?
- Yeah, I did.
Is it clothes what you want?
You want to take my clothes?
You need my clothes so much?
You don't have your own clothes?
No! No! Not the Torah, please!
God! God, help me!
Mr. Jones, please don't do that!
Please! Please! No!
What's you need my tallis for?
Why are you doing this?
- We love you.
- Mr. Jones...
why are you doing this?
- You're not happy with our service?
- No.
God! I don't want to be
with these filthy crooks!
- We'll fix that for you, bucko.
- No!
There you go!
- How'd we do?
- I got the rest of his money.
This you couldn't throw out first!
America.
Landsmen! Landsmen!
Hello!
Landsmen!
Landsmen!
Hello!
Landsmen!
Dost thou speak English?
Dost thou...
You know, I think he's crazy.
We have decided...
that thou shouldst have this
money for the train to Akron.
We are sorry it cannot be more.
We all hope it will help
thee on thy journey...
Brother Avram.
I will never forget thy kindness.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, children.
Good-bye. Thank you very much.
Thanks.
- Good-bye. -
Good-bye, Avram.
My parents have a farm...
not big like this one,
but they have a nice farm.
How is it that thou are not a farmer?
Well, God made me a rabbi.
- Why?
- Why?
I think he had enough farmers.
What a wonderful country.
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."
Simple Simon says, "No laughing."
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."
I really have to go!
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."
Don't bother the man, honey.
Simple Simon says, "You
don't have to play."
I think we're an hour and a half away.
- Mommy, I'm getting sleepy.
- Then take a nap.
- Can you stop it?
- Mama, I'm hungry.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?
Now I want you all to
stay calm and listen...
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
First thing is: don't turn around.
There's a man behind
you with a big shotgun...
and he don't care to be recognized.
Them that don't
believe me is gonna die.
All right now. You all put
your hands on top of your heads.
Good. That's real good.
Now we're all gonna play
like we're in church.
You got something for
the collection, sir?
Very kind.
Ma'am? Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am?
Thank you.
Well, thank you all very much.
Mr. Jake, I'm jumping here,
you go at the next bend.
Remember, folks...
the best way to keep your heads
is keep your hands on top of them.
And don't turn around.
Better to give than to
receive, ain't it, folks?
Simple Simon says, "Everybody laugh."
Don't you get the joke?
Simple says, "Everybody gotta laugh."
It's difficult to explain that
a Jew can't ride on a Saturday.
And, for a Jew, Saturday
begins on Friday.
- Name?
- Joseph Pellerton.
See the foreman. Name?
Good? Good.
See the foreman. Name?
You funny looking fellow.
- Yes. Yes.
- See the foreman. Name?
Yes.
See the foreman.
- You ever work on railroad before?
- No. This is the first time for me.
See the foreman.
- You sure talk funny.
- Name?
- Yes.
- See the foreman.
- Yes.
- Name?
John Browning.
Strange-looking characters
looking for jobs.
See the foreman.
- Name?
- Belinski.
Sorry, Paco. Sorry. It
wouldn't happen again.
You can bet your boots on that.
He did it again.
Wait, Paco. Wait!
Wait, it wasn't done on purpose.
- Avram, some water over here.
- Coming right up.
Got nice, fresh water coming right up.
- Avram.
- What? What happened?
Paco? No!
- It was an accident. I didn't mean to...
- I kill you, pendejo!
I'll bust your Jewish bones!
You smart, you listen.
We open a big restaurant.
You work one year, make
enough money to buy a wagon.
Maybe we even go with you, huh?
Open a big joint in San Francisco!
Paco, would you show
me where to buy a horse?
Hey, pendejo. How you
going to find your way?
Paco, please, just show
me where to buy a horse.
You're crazy, Jew-boy!
You gonna get lost!
Believe me, I won't get lost!
Oh, yes, you will.
Good-bye!
Good-bye, Paco.
Good-bye, Mr. Ping!
Wait! Wait, horsie!
Wait, wait, horsie! Take it easy.
Nice horsie. That's a good horsie.
That's it.
Let's take it slow and easy.
Slow! Slow.
That's it. You're a good horsie.
Sarah Mindl. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.
Oh, my Sarah, Sarah.
Oh, show me what you meant to me.
Oh, my food! My food!
Why me?
My food, you're gonna take?
You got the whole world,
you're gonna take my food!
Not you! Wait!
Not you! Wait! Horsie, wait!
No food and no horse.
Come back!
Come here, horsie!
I'll be good to you! I'll be nice!
I'll pick grass for you!
I'll scratch your back!
I'll give you a nice rub!
Chicken, chicken.
Chickie, chickie, chicken.
Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.
I just want to eat you.
Come here, wait! I
don't wanna hurt you!
I just want to make you kosher!
How hungry are you?
I'm pretty hungry.
If you had been here yesterday...
we could've had roast chicken!
So that's Jewish cooking, huh?
Pretty good, huh?
Where're you coming from?
Back there.
You're from California, huh?
California is that way?
You're lost, ain't you?
- Got any money?
- No.
Got any food?
No.
Sure talk funny.
- Where you born at?
- Poland.
Is that near Pittsburgh?
No. That's near Czechoslovakia.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And you're going to California?
Yes.
You ain't gonna make it.
Excuse me...
in the morning, would
you be kind enough...
to point out in which
direction is San Francisco?
- Sure.
- Good.
- In the morning.
- In that case...
would you like to fight
for that last fish?
You think you got a chance?
I think I can say, with complete
confidence, none whatsoever...
but I'm still hungry.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
What you call this kind of fish?
- That's a trout.
- A trout?
It's got a lot of bones.
You got family waiting for you?
I'm promised a wife when
I get to San Francisco.
But I haven't never met her.
You gonna marry a woman
that you never seen?
I didn't say I never seen her.
I said I never met her.
They sent me a picture
before I left Poland.
Well.
What you think?
Well, that's my kind of woman.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun, you.
Shee-it!
I guess so.
This other one ain't bad, neither.
- Good night, Rabbi.
- Good night, cowboy.
Well, it's nice meeting
up with you, pard.
Nice meeting up with you, pard.
- You got it straight?
- Oh, sure.
Right from this tree...
I head straight north
five or six weeks...
till I come to the flat country.
- Yeah.
- Then I make a left for two days.
That way I avoid the Indians.
Then I cross the river...
and I make a sharp right,
away from the mountains.
Once I get to the
desert, God willing...
I just continue straight as piss...
till I come to the
ocean. Take a left...
keeping the ocean on
my right shoulder...
and just hot-tail it
right into San Francisco.
Good?
Pretty good.
Well...
I hope you make it.
Okay, wait, horse. Good.
All right, go, horsie.
That's it, straight ahead.
- Speak any Mexican, do you?
- No. Why do you ask?
Oh, nothing. Just curious.
If you should ever come to San Francisco,
I hope that you'll call on me...
and we could talk
over some nice times.
- Come on, horsie.
- Hey...
that way.
That way?
Of course, I know it's that way...
but first I have to go around that
big log before I can go that way!
You mustn't turn a horse so
quick. That's how accidents happen.
You gotta start nice and slow. That
way you get off on the right foot.
Hey! What kind of crazy horses
they got in this country?
- What do you call this in Jewish?
- A tokhes.
Well, you keep your eyes on this tokhes
and don't take them off till I tell you.
Shee-it! Don't get no
closer to that edge, Rabbi.
- What kind of word is that?
- What word?
You always say, "shee-it"
at a certain moment.
Shee-it?
What do you... You must have a
word in your language that you...
What do say when you get
really took by surprise?
- Yeah. - That's it.
That's what "shee-it" means?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Slow. Slow, horsie.
Well, this is it.
- Where are you going?
- Back down the river a few miles...
it's a good place to cross.
- Why not here?
- Here?
Here's a good place to die...
but it ain't a good
place to cross the river.
We just jump in and swim
straight across. Simple as pie.
You wanna kill yourself, go ahead.
I don't like the odds.
I'm taking the long way.
Well, that shouldn't be so difficult.
Wait a minute! Where
you going, horsie?
I didn't say where to go yet!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
That snake could've killed me!
Well, damn me! If he
can do it, I can do it.
God damn!
Shit!
You know, Rabbi, you're
one crazy bastard!
Remember...
I'm the kind of person when he says
he's gonna do something, he does it.
You got a guarantee, huh? He could
be laying out there somewhere...
- dead in the wilderness!
- Bite your tongue!
You're talking about
my future son-in-law.
Somebody, maybe, should
remind Sarah Mindl.
Rosalie.
Rosalie.
- Get your sister away from that idiot!
- I'm not mixing in. I'm not mixing in.
This is a nice little
town. Cold, but nice.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't think that fellow is 100%.
I'll see if I can find
us some place to stay.
- Someplace pretty cheap.
- Yeah, pretty cheap.
This ain't traveling weather.
I know this place ain't
fancy, but it's got a roof.
And like you say, it's cheap.
So we just stay here for a
couple months and then head south.
No. I've wasted too much time already.
When they banged on your head,
they must've mushed your brains!
So goddamned worried about time,
how come you don't ride on Saturday?
I told you, it's against my
religion to ride on the Sabbath.
I got me a new religion, too! And one of
the things you ain't allowed to do is die!
There's real mountains out there, and
that's a real blizzard building up.
- I'm telling you we can't make it.
- I can make it.
God damn! I ain't gonna let you talk
me into this. It's just impossible!
Every goddamn Indian knows that!
Every goddamn trapper knows that!
I know, you don't like
it when I talk that way.
But I'm telling you, you ain't
gonna talk me into it this time!
Am I trying to talk you into anything?
Good night! Have a nice trip.
Good night. And thanks for
everything you did for me...
up until the time I
needed you the most!
Don't wake me in the morning!
I'll try to be as quiet as possible!
What do you think now, Rabbi?
It's cold.
You should see it in winter.
In the Talmud it says,
"Find thyself a teacher."
However, there were times I feared
that he would find another pupil.
Get your horse down!
If we'd have gone on,
we'd have froze to death!
No, make one!
Move! Come here...
closer!
Wait.
We are doing this to
keep warm, aren't we?
In that case, you can
put your arms around me.
Come here, darling.
That's better.
Hey, look.
I think we've found
the Garden of Eden.
Well, it ain't exactly
the Garden of Eden.
What a wonderful place America is!
There are no walls
around these cities.
You don't have to worry about soldiers
coming in from the next town...
and killing people.
You know, I think this is the West.
We're in the Wild West here, just
like the books I read in Poland.
This is a wonderful city. They
got banks and restaurants...
they got merchants of all kinds
here. And look at the people...
how they're dressed. I
think those are cowboys.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Hold up here. I got a little
business I wanna take care of.
Hold on to the horses, will you?
I'll be right back.
Move it!
- What's happening?
- We just robbed the bank!
- What did you say?
- We just robbed the bank!
What do you mean, "we?"
The bank, they just robbed the bank!
- We need a posse, boys, let's go!
- What for?
I said, we need a posse!
To hell with you! I ain't
got any money in the bank.
- But they robbed it!
- Well go get 'em. It's your bank.
- $5 a man when we catch them !
- $5?
- $7.50!
- Not worth it...
- I'll go for $11.
- $10!
- $11 !
- All right, you bastards...
$11. Let's go!
Don't get comfortable.
We can't stop here.
- How could you do this to me?
- It's what I do. I'm a bank robber.
- But you made me a bank robber!
- So what? You get your half.
- Get out of my life!
- What?
Get out of my life!
Get out! I don't want you here!
Get out of my life!
Take it easy!
Take it easy. You better cool off.
Guns?
You gonna shoot guns at me?
Guns!
- You know, you're really crazy.
- Sure I'm crazy. I'm a bank robber.
Who else would rob a bank but a crazy?
You, you ain't no bank robber.
All you did was hold the horses.
- Think I could tell them that?
- Sure!
- And would they listen?
- Yeah, they'll listen.
Then they'll hang you!
- And what if I gave back the money?
- You mean, your half?
- Yes, I mean my half!  - First they'll
string you up by your balls...
till you tell them where the other
half is, then they'll hang you!
Make up your mind, pardner.
Go fast, horsie! Go fast!
Wait, Tommy, wait! I'm coming.
Looks like fresh tracks.
They was here all
right. Here's some blood.
Hey, that was me. I
knew I got that one.
If you did, he sure took a
long time to start bleeding.
All right, let's go, men. Let's
look for a tree for the hanging.
