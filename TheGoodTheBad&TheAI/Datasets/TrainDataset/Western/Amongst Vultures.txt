Don't forget, Martha, the North Ranch
gets their food supplies today.
You see that the boys don't leave.
- Don't worry. We'll manage.
I sure hope we'll have better luck
with that damn bear. We've got two more.
That old bear's long overdue.
- He's a mean one, isn't he?
Be careful. You yourself told me
when they get old they're vicious.
With Bob and Winnetou helping me out,
I should manage. Besides,
our friend Old Surehand's arriving.
You should be thinking up...
a special meal.
Martin, will you bring back
a bear for me?
But it has to be tiny.
- Well, I'll try to find one...
as small as your nose.
Ma.
- Goodbye, son.
Bye-bye! Goodbye, dear.
- Be careful!
We're grateful to the Chief of the Apaches
that he'll help us hunt the bear.
Winnetou has discovered tracks.
- Good. Well, what are we waiting for?
Are there any signs?
- Impatience's the privilege of the young.
I think Martin wants to be back tomorrow.
Our friend Old Surehand's arriving.
He's has always helped the Indian.
Winnetou is also his friend.
The bear's cave is over there.
We must leave the horses here.
We'll get him this time.
- Yep!
That's the fifth one this week.
- Here is his track.
Well, it's no use letting the dogs
get tangled up with him.
Yippie!
Indians, chasing those white men!
They're Schoschones.
Tell me, my friend, do you know this man?
- No.
Them Schoschones
could be on the war path.
Winnetou knows they are not.
- But they were chasing those white men.
That is one version. But what was it,
we saw? The evil men chasing the good,
or good men chasing the evil?
- Winnetou's right.
I don't know the answer.
The farm!
Martha!
Mother!
No.
I've searched all over.
Look at that! You found this here?
Whose is it?
Schoschone. But they are friends
to the white man.
Even the white bandits wouldn't do
a thing like this. Are you trying to say
the Indians weren't here?
- My Schoschone brothers did not commit
these murders.
- But you...
You, yourself are an Indian.
You are just out to protect...
your stinking, heathen brothers?
- You cannot judge, you're lost in grief.
I'm sure of one thing:
I can see the truth! Get out!
Winnetou shall find the killer.
You shall see whether he's Indian...
or white.
Father?
You must eat.
Sally?
- Yeah?
You can clear the table.
Mr. Baumann, someone here to see you.
How do you do? Good afternoon.
I'm sorry to disturb you
in your hour of mourning.
But you see,
I witnessed those murders.
Monstrous crime.
You... can tell me
who those murdering varmints were?
Yes. Indians. But, who they were,
I don't know. Schoschones, I think.
I hid during the attack. When you...
appeared with another Indian, I ran away.
It was terrible. I was too frightened,
even though I wanted to help them.
But it was more than I could do.
What's your name?
- Reverend Tobias Barton,
Preacher of the Gospel
of the Holy Saints.
What are you doing here?
- I was under the impression...
that I would be able to stay here
under this roof, before continuing...
on my way to Llano.
- To Llano, eh?
Yes.
- Where'd you put your horse?
I'm a humble man. I'm afraid
I've never been on a horse.
Like our Lord I walk the wilderness.
Tell me this, then. How do you explain
that leather patch thereon your britches?
These clothes are just hand-me-downs,
young man.
Let him be, son.
No stranger's ever knocked
on our door in vain.
Where's the Boss?
- Waiting for you inside.
Where've you been? Where are the others?
- We had bad luck.
Weller saw the Baumann men riding off.
- So we went to the farm. - You liars!
No!We thought we can grab a little gold.
- The woman and the kid yelled like pigs.
Yeah, we sure shot them up good.
And the Indians saw us.
And that's when Pinky got shot.
- Where's Weller?
Suddenly he wasn't there.
- We've a job! If they decide to...
follow him, do you know what that means?
- Yeah.
Hey, give me a little cloth.
- No bandages. Don't bother.
Joking, ain't you?
- You'll need more than bandages, Jack,
ignoring my orders.
Stewy!You take six men,
and head off the gold traders,
before they reach the Baumann's.
Billy, your men will be keeping an eye...
on the farm to see that the Indians
don't meet up with the Baumann's.
And see that no message gets through
to Taylorville. Whoever finds Weller...
flattens him.
- No!
Reports to me
where Weller's hiding out. Got it?
Oh!What time is it now, Wabble?
- Just a bit past three.
Old Surehand will show up any time, now.
- I can't sit any longer.
Want to go to gallop? That's faster!
Indians!
- I haven't seen one yet. Don't fool me.
Oh no!
Sure. They do bird calls to throw us
off guard. Then they sneak up fast,
and before you know it...
I sure wish Old Surehand was here.
Here I am. Do you want me?
- Boy!
Old Surehand!
I must say, you had us worried.
I can take it, yeah.
But she was pretty scared.
- Oh, you were the one who was frightened!
You weren't frightened? You were the one!
- Well... Miss Annie, Old Surehand.
Hello.
- Miss Annie.
I know your father. When I saw you last,
you were... Well, you were a lot smaller!
Why were you late? What kept you?
- Well, Miss Annie's a mite uneasy,
sitting in a saddle.
- I'm happy to meet famous Old Surehand.
Well... I'm Surehand. I don't know
whether I'm famous. If we want to make...
Baumann's ranch by nightfall, we'd better
get going. My horse is over here. Come on!
Alright. Dismount!
- What is it?
Stay low!
Beautiful, Old Surehand! Bravo!
- You see...
why he's called Old Surehand?
Never misses!
Wonderful! It's really...
beautiful.
Take it easy, Miss Annie.
Don't feel bad.
Remember, he'd just seen that Old Indian
shot down, right before his eyes.
And he don't like that.
Hey!Winnetou!
- Winnetou!
A real Indian?
- And a true friend.
Winnetou is very glad to see Old Surehand,
as well as his companions.
Surehand and his friends are grateful
that our paths cross.
You old scoundrel! How are you?
- Fine.
Miss Annie, I want you to meet my friend
Winnetou, Chief of all the Apaches.
Greatest hunter, friend of the white man,
and a great guy. - Hello.
May Winnetou ask to where
Miss Annie is bound? - To Arizona.
Yeah. I'm taking them to Baumann's farm
to rest up for the night.
His wife and daughter...
His farm was attacked...
while Baumann was away.
- Murdered? Did you hear about that?
No.
- Who did it?
The same men who shot down my friend,
over here.
Who is he?
- Oitka-Peteh, Chief of the Schoschones.
We've got somebody watching us, huh?
- I know.
We've got a visitor.
Don't be frightened.
Alright!
You can come out, now.
You should know you're among friends.
Wokadeh knows that Winnetou
and Old Surehand are his friends.
Who murdered your Chief?
- Some white bandits called The Vultures.
Why were they after you?
- They know that we are the only ones...
who saw The Vultures
raid the Baumann ranch. It was them.
Now, Winnetou. We'll go over to Baumann.
He'll need us. - No.
I cannot go there again.
The man is so filled with bitterness.
He believes we committed the murder.
- I'll handle him, huh?
We'll go ahead. You come later.
Alright?
So long.
Come on, Miss Annie. Come on, Wabble.
Let's get going.
Here they come!
Ok, boys. Gold traders. On your horses!
I'm Judge Leader from St. Louis.
I'm indeed happy to see you, gentlemen.
My companions and I are looking
for the Baumann ranch. We've been told...
that we could buy some supplies there
before we proceed to Llano.
Baumann's ranch? That's not as near
as you think. We're going to a place...
where we can get much better supplies.
- And may we go with you?
Ah, yes. We was just going there.
Why don't you all come along?
I know the boys would sure like it.
With our seven guns and yours...
nothing bad could happen.
- Good. Thanks very much. I'll ask them.
Do you agree that we should join them?
- Yes, we do.
Boys,
I want you to meet our new friends.
Martin!
I'm sorry. We've come at a bad time.
Winnetou told me all about it.
If you hadn't, Dad would be upset.
- Where's your father?
He's right inside.
Hello, Martin.
Wabble.
Sorry. This is Miss Annie Dilman.
- How are you? - Pleased to meet you.
We're taking her to Arizona, to her father.
- Words of small comfort...
at a time like this, but I'm truly sorry.
- Thanks.
Baumann, how are you feeling?
No use, I'm afraid.
Know who did it?
- No.
Father thinks it was Indians.
The Preacher there
says he saw the whole thing.
Do you know this man?
- No.
Sally, take this young lady
to her room, will you?
Mr Baumann! Mr Baumann!
Two Indians are coming towards the house!
Take it easy, Baumann!
These two Indians come in peace.
They're not coming on my land!
- Hold it! They come under my protection.
I don't care!
They're not staying on my land!
Now, look! They're Winnetou and Wokadeh.
Come on! Give me your gun!
Winnetou. You wanted to bring me
the murderers of my wife and child, right?
Well, is that them?
- No. But I bring the body of a warrior.
The body of the Chief of the Schoschones.
- What do I care? I didn't kill him.
Baumann, you should care who did.
Whoever kills an Indian, is no criminal.
- Listen to what Wokadeh tells you!
For only he can say
who the murderers were. Speak, Wokadeh!
Wokadeh, along with his father,
saw who killed your woman and child.
The Vulture bandits did it.
- You liars!
Don't, father!
- I know you were the ones who did this.
I have a man who can swear to it.
- Who is that man?
He's a preacher. A religious man.
And you two managed to murder the one man
who was probably trying to help.
- He belonged to The Vultures...
and was shot by me.
- I don't believe a word you're saying.
And as for your dead father,
I spit on him.
He is full of grief. He's a sick man.
Wokadeh must try to forgive him.
He cannot dare expect a pardon.
He can only pray...
to the sacred spirits.
Trouble?
Wokadeh cannot ignore
the Bear Hunter's insult.
The Schoschones will seek their revenge.
Our friend needs help.
You must warn him to be careful.
- Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.
You and l,
we'll catch the murderers, huh?
Exactly who is that pretty young girl?
- As I told you, her name is Annie Dilman.
And she's going to her father
in Taylorville to deliver...
a nice wad of cash. He's a gold trader.
- I bet carrying that much gold is heavy.
She's a strong girl. It's in the belt
around her stomach. - Wabble.
Don't talk such nonsense.
It wasn't nonsense.
- Perhaps you would like me
to accompany the young lady.
She would be quite safe. - Oh, fine!
You mean go with you and walk
all the way to Llano, right?
Well, in all humility, I was daring
to hope for a seat on the wagon.
You'd better explain yourself a bit more.
- I work for God, you could say.
I was sent out West, a religious guide
to a party of pioneers...
who were bound for Llano.
There's no wagon train near here.
- It's...
at Whiteshave River.
- Now, what was that name of yours?
Tobias Barton.
- You're sure?
You know, if you had red hair,
I could swear...
you were a horse thief I once knew,
by the name of Stealing Fox.
And where is this man now?
- Last I heard, he was caught.
And you know
what happens to horse thieves?
May the Lord show mercy to his soul.
- Amen.
It's no use. You ain't never going to get
that dress to fit over that money belt.
I've got to fit it on. I promised father
I wouldn't take my money belt off.
Either the dress is going to give up
or the belt's going to give up.
The belt's going to give up.
I should at least hide it
under the mattress then.
Sally, why is that bell ringing?
- It means the men's work day is done.
And coming up, who's that?
- An officer.
I see that.
I went to a big officer's ball
one night last spring.
It was wonderful!
I danced the whole night!
Is Martin a good dancer?
- He's never had no time for such things.
Martin's nice looking.
We're ordered to clean up a criminal gang
called The Vultures who hideout somewhere
between here and Llano.
- That's good news, I'd say.
In mysterious ways
does the Lord attend us.
Now, my little band of pioneers
can cross over to Llano unharmed.
You mean the wagon train
that's going to Arizona?
You've heard of them, my son?
- Colonel Harman has ordered us...
to escort them. And we've been alerted.
My squad's going to Whiteshave River.
I expect you know Miss Dilman.
She's from Taylorville, too.
No, Sir. I haven't had that pleasure yet.
I've been only two days...
at the post in Taylorville.
- Are you hungry? You wait!
I'll bring you some chicken.
- Alright.
Lieutenant, how about a little something
to wet your whistle? Come and sit down!
Well, I wouldn't say no to that!
- How about you, Reverend?
No, no. Never.
How about you? Good for the liver,
and it'll help you sleep a lot better.
It's a local specialty.
Hope you enjoy it.
Thanks.
Let's drink to you and your men
and hope that you finish off...
those Vultures real quick.
- I'll drink up to that, alright!
Lieutenant? I hope you can tell me news
of Colonel Harmen's children.
The day before my departure
both girls were ill.
They were both outdoors on Wednesday.
Their Mother said they're quite well now.
Thanks so much!
That man's a fake!
The Colonel has no children.
Besides, for two weeks he hasn't been
in Taylorville. - Are you certain?
Colonel Harmen's my uncle.
- Just have another drink!
No, I'm on my way.
- Lieutenant?
Are you sure you have men
at Whiteshave River?
What do you mean by that?
- You talk about children who don't exist.
Maybe you have men who don't exist.
Now, Miss Dilman says...
Harmen hasn't any children
and isn't in Taylorville.
Do you doubt me? As an officer
I demand satisfaction for that!
If you're an officer, I'd be happy to...
- Gentlemen!We're in a home of sorrow.
Listen you! I wish I had time
to give you what's coming to you!
Well, what's stopping you?
- I have to carry out my orders.
Nothing must delay me. But don't you
forget this: We'll meet again!
Say there!
You weren't thinking of using that, right?
- Oh, no. No.
That's only my good luck piece.
- That's a right pretty little toy.
It means a lot to me.
- Where did you get it?
I bought it from a trader
about two years ago.
Last time I saw that,
it was in possession of a friend of mine.
Sure! Pistols like that are common place.
- Sure. Sure.
But not with the initials W.B.!
W.B. stands for William Bond.
You're a thief, my friend!
- Not only a thief, but a murderer!
William Bond vanished a little more
than a year ago up in Llano.
He must be the one who killed him!
- Get away!
Keep your hands up there!
No tricks, or you're all finished! See?
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.
I know one, though. The idea is
that you've got to pull the trigger fast!
Well, it worked!
For one minute I thought that he had me!
I'm very sorry, Miss Annie. I don't like
doing that in front of a lady.
This young fellow sure was begging
to get himself killed.
It was him or me.
I had no choice but to shoot.
He's dead.
- Naturally!
Did you ever hear of Old Surehand
ever missing? - I'll second that.
Horse thief! I'll get him! Don't worry!
- No.
No, no. We have that horse
from the phoney officer.
Hey! He left his Bible here!
- He won't miss it.
But I've got a note he'll miss.
That man slipped it to him in the Bible.
Hey! Come and listen to this:
The Boss wants me to ride with the train.
Report back to the hideout.
- That's as phoney as a three dollar bill.
They'll lead them folks into some trap.
- That's a long ride to Whiteshave River.
If we're to help those people,
we've got to do some thinking.
Hey!That's my pal!
That's the old Baumann again!
Come on.
Go on in! Go on!
Look who's here, Boss!
Hey, look at that pretty coat!
Hey, does it fit you nice?
So you're back. It's about time, you rat!
- It wasn't my fault,
no matter what Fred and Joe say.
Let me see them! I can prove it!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
- But then...
You may be seeing them somewhere else!
You should be grateful to me! I told
the Baumann's their farm was attacked...
by Indians. That's all I could do!
Where's Tom?
Speak up, you louse!
He's dead.
Tell me who did it.
- Old Surehand.
Tom should have known.
He drew on him.
Old Surehand!
You can't out, draw that one!
- What do we do?
What do you mean? Tomorrow you're
at Whiteshave River with the settlers.
Both, Stewy and Rod will back you up.
You lead them around the plant of Sierra
and divert the whole treck South.
By the next night you should be in Llano.
Put up for the night there.
We'll wait here at White Rock.
Signal me when the time's right.
- Just a minute.
Let me tell you some news.
- Tell me. Go ahead.
You know who's staying at Baumann's? Boy!
A beautiful girl... with a money belt.
I bet she'd drop it, if we tickled her!
Is the Chief of the Apaches permitted
to interrupt the Schoschones' meeting?
The Chief of the Apaches is welcomed
by the Schoschones at any time.
What does my brother wish?
- Wokadeh and the elders seek vengeance.
The spirits of all my ancestors are
awaiting their vengeance. We shall...
uphold our honour when Manitou approves.
- But it can bring war, Wokadeh.
Do you propose to start it?
To have all our people shed their blood?
True peace can't exist between white men
and us as long as the Bear Hunter lives.
Do you want revenge, Wokadeh?
Then do as I say.
Let me ride out until I catch that gang
and you can do far more...
to avenge the murder of your Chief.
- Say they're not found? Then what?
Then I shall bring back proof.
I'll return...
when the moon is full, to my friend.
Good fortune attend you.
They could have taken me along.
I can shoot. I'd be a help.
That's only for the big girls.
- Don't you think I'm a big girl?
That Vulture gang isn't playing.
You just stick around.
Why do men think women are helpless?
I'm a great shot!
That wasn't it. I wanted to hit...
the other one over there.
- Oh, I see.
Where are you going?
Don't you have anything I can do?
Yeah. Go and help Sally darn socks!
- Men!
Help!
Come on!
- Here we go.
Quiet down!
- Oh no! Help!
Martin!
Untie the horse! Quick!
Come on!
-Let me go!
Let go, you idiots! Let go!
Take your hands off that girl!
You should know how to treat a lady.
Betsy, show her up to her room.
I'm going to the ranch
you kidnapped me from.
You'll get back if you play along with me.
- Come upstairs. You'll be safer there.
You boys behave yourselves.
We've got to act charming.
Now, please get out of this room!
- I'll remember the next time.
Meanwhile, where's the cash?
- What do you mean, huh?
Take a look!
Betsy!
- Hands off, huh?
I think you boys
had better search her. Go on!
Hands up!
Now, get out!
Do you prefer to go on?
Don't fool yourself. There's only
one thing that will get you out of here:
the money.
So, you just think it over.
She's a wild cat!
- I thought you said she was a lady!
Barry, I want you and Jude to ride down
and get the gunpowder. But, hurry.
Be back by nightfall when Stewy
gets here with the gold traders.
Mick? The girl has a gun. Stay outside.
Keep an eye on her window. But, watch out.
She's a pretty good shot.
- Don't worry.
Hi.
Good day.
I'm a stranger. Can you help me?
- Go ahead. What is it?
Well, I met a man who said
I might sell horses around here.
What man was that? Who sent you here?
- A fellow I bumped into at Llano.
Tall, with black hair. But this man
knew a particular kind of buyer...
who was what I was looking for.
So, if any of you gentlemen...
are interested...
- You can peddle horses anywhere.
Yeah.
But mine are kind of special horses.
The brands, after all,
are not too clear.
Did you bring them with you?
- Do you think I'm crazy?
I'll bring them around in a day or two.
I tie them outside. You'd just untie them.
But they're not free!
My black-haired friend told me you...
If you like a horse trader like me...
if you and the boys would consider having
me as part of your group... Because...
This group is The Vultures?
Mister, you sure are mighty shrew.
Yeah. I guess I am.
- Besides stolen horses, what's your game?
Anything else to show me?
Well, not right away.
First I'm going to buy all of you
to seal the bargain, right?
Alright! Stop it! Now, cut it out!
I'd say that someone didn't hear
your order to cut out that shooting.
Who's in that room, Boss?
- Boss! Boss!
That girl's gone crazy! She's taking
pot-shots at me out of the window.
She's driving me out of my mind!
- Who wanted you to use your stupid mind?
I just said, "Hold up outside"!
Stop that! Get back to your post!
Let me have one!
Give me a half.
He's not only a good shot,
he knows his poker!
I'm going to christen him Poker Face!
Why not call him by his real name:
Martin Baumann!
You sure of that, now?
- Positive.
I saw him at the farm with the girl.
Well, what do you know?
The son of the Bear Hunter, huh?
You won a medal.
- You miss your sweetie, I guess?
Stay right where you are, Poker Face.
- I'll just take your gun, Baumann.
I wouldn't want you
to get in any trouble.
String him up, the liar!Take him out!
I'm afraid we've arrived here
in the middle of trouble.
Now, what's he done?
- He's a horse thief.
One of the Vulture gang.
We just caught him before you arrived.
And these fellows?
- I happen to be a prospector.
George Preston, Sir. And these are
my workers... and they're honest ones.
Have you heard this gentleman accuse you
of being a horse thief?
Listen, boy. You're talking to a judge.
I'm trying to help you.
I'm Judge Leader from St. Louis.
- Don't move!
Stay away from there.
Hello.
- Hi!
So, you've been begging for trouble!
Quiet, everybody! Quiet down, please!
There's no defence against thieving
you can offer.
I had to come inside here. So I said
I was a horse thief. Then they found out
just who I really was.
The Vulture gang? There they are.
- Don't believe that, Sir. He's lying.
Quiet! Silence! I said silence! Now!
I'm sorry. That's an extremely
flimsy story. Who would believe it?
There's a very severe penalty
for horse thieves like you.
Gentlemen, let's go!
Martin!
- Come on!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Come on! Hey!
Winnetou must go. You must warn
your father to beware of the Schoschones.
They want his death.
Winnetou seeks the murderer.
Come.
What's the matter?
Indians.
- Where?
I don't know.
But, maybe I can spot them.
Alright. I'll go ahead.
Don't any of you move now. Don't forget.
You're in charge.
- Ok.
Surehand's going to be so mad.
What happened?
- Baumann was took by the Indians.
Well, what the devil were you doing?
- Just standing.
Where are your guns?
- Well...
Come on!
You wait, I get you. You'll be sorry.
Winnetou did not return.
I went out to find the old Bear Hunter.
Manitou wills it so.
Did Wokadeh capture the other men?
- No. His friends followed.
Our arrows are ready.
Hey.
Hey, hey. Look.
- Isn't that Winnetou?
We're in luck.
Winnetou's the only one that can help us.
Winnetou hails the new Chief
of the Schoschones.
You! Stay here!
It seems the Chief of the Apaches
has second sight, huh?
Winnetou knew Old Surehand would try
to free our friend from the Schoschones.
You will help me, Winnetou?
- Wokadeh still feels
the Bear Hunter should atone.
- I know that. It's no reason for him
to be killed for it, though.
- Old Surehand has courage.
But planning is the one way to do this.
The moon tonight shines brightly.
Then the death watch begins,
and Old Surehand can free his friend.
Good idea.
Did you coyotes decide
how to kill me yet, huh?
That's not asking too much, is it?
I mean, a fellow has a right to know
if he's going to be burned or scalped...
or whatever else you have in mind.
I'll come back.
There he is.
Take it easy, there.
- Chief of the Apaches. Why are you here?
I told Old Surehand
just how to get to Wokadeh's tent.
Winnetou admires the white man
more than his brothers.
Winnetou admires justice. For Old Surehand
merely wishes to ask the Schoschone elders
to stop doing harm.
You have the power to arrange everything.
He should be honoured by Wokadeh,
not hunted by your men.
What do you plan to do?
Wokadeh shall not make his decision
as a prisoner.
The pale face shall be my guest.
Come on!
Now then, what do we do?
- Don't you know? - We get him out!
Just how are we going to do that
without any guns, you nitwit?
Surehand understands Wokadeh's feelings
about the death of his father,
the great Chief. But, we too,
wish to avenge the death
of our two white sisters.
Will the brave young warriors...
of the Schoschones give us their help?
- It is too late to save the Bear Hunter.
I'm sorry
if Old Surehand is disappointed.
Wokadeh's revenge for the insult
that Baumann gave to his dead father...
can come later. Will you help us?
They fear their prisoner will be rescued
after the warriors leave.
Do the old warriors wish to insult me?
I gave my word. Winnetou tells you
his brother is a fair man.
Wabble!
You speak hereof peace!
And you try to fool me!Your men...
come to attack!The pale face's tongue
is split like that of a serpent.
Wokadeh!
- No! Wokadeh casts out Winnetou!
We are no longer brothers! Winnetou lies,
just like the pale face.
Winnetou spoke the truth.
The white men thought I was in danger.
Too bad for them!
- Alright.
It's for Wokadeh to make a decision.
My life is in Wokadeh's hands.
Manitou shall decide. In our tribe
there are three great marksmen.
And each shall shoot an arrow at you,
at will. If you can stop the arrow...
with a bullet, you are free.
I accept Manitou's justice.
- And bear in mind,
if you hit the warrior
and not his arrow, you will die.
You are sending him to his death.
Won't you hear more?
The man's our friend.
- Not mine, though.
It was my responsibility.
Let me take his place.
Winnetou, my friend...
This is my affair.
Winnetou should have known that his friend
Old Surehand would always hit the mark.
But the second one
sure tickled my ribs!Wow!
Manitou has spoken. Old Surehand
did not lie. He is at liberty.
And we will follow you.
Take care of the others, will you?
- Oh, we will.
And give Old Wabble a drink.
He sure needs one!
We're coming to the Valley of Death.
There are Indian guards...
all over the place.
If we don't take this short cut,
we'll miss the wagon train.
End of the trail, eh?
- You rescue so many girls.
Sorry, you weren't satisfied.
- I'm going to miss you!
You're packing. Are you getting ready?
- Yes, that's right.
My name's Martin Baumann.
I'm looking for my father and his friends.
I was wondering if they were around here.
- Oh, sure, sure. They got here today.
They're the ones that'll be guiding us.
- Let me give you a hand. - Thank you.
Howdy. Can you tell me where I can find
the men who arrived today?
Yeah. Right there.
- Thanks.
Hey!The horse thief!
They're not the friends
you're looking for, are they?
I'm getting mighty tired of them names!
If you want my identity,
just ask the Preacher here.
- l?
You say I'm to know?
I never met you before.
How dare you strike this God fearing man!
God fearing man? You're mistaken...
- This time you won't escape.
Right! He won't be getting away this time.
- You're guilty of horse thieving, and now
you do this! I feel I should punish you
according to the law of the people.
You can't order the rope for me!
- That's what we do to horse thieves!
Mother! Mother!They're going to hang him!
They say he's a horse thief!
You sure?
- Yes! I was there!
Stop!
Stop!What do you think you're doing?
Do you think that by hanging
an innocent man you're all safe?
My, my!Who is that girl?
What's the matter? Afraid to run away?
Has this fake convinced you,
Martin deserved that fate?
- No. It was I. Judge George Leader.
Your judgment's as false as he is.
To the innocent you offer hanging.
And the criminals you let off!
- Didn't your mother teach you respect...
for a man of the cloth?
- When you learn the facts I wonder...
how much respect you'll show!
He is not a preacher, he's a criminal!
Oh Lord, protect this young girl
from the sin of falsehood,
for she knows not what she's doing.
You've mistaken me for someone else, dear.
I wouldn't forget you.
You ran away from the Baumann ranch.
Baumann's ranch? l?
- You ran off in such a hurry...
that you forgot your bible!
- I have my bible.
Oh? Then bring it out!
Where is it? I put it inside...
Disappeared, has it, he says!
- If it fell out of my pocket...
I'm going to look for it. Excuse me.
- What are you here for? Why interfere?
Only because I wouldn't hang a man
who's innocent.
My father in Arizona is proud of me.
- I apologize. I know no one in Arizona.
Now, listen! I'm telling you,
that young man over there...
is not a horse thief. And that Preacher
is a fake. Well, who do you believe now?
Wagon Master Howard, what do we do?
I don't know.
Might be the chance of an injustice.
If the boy's dead, you can't correct him.
It may be the last time we do it.
But let's take them under guard,
and the courts can decide when we get them
both to Arizona. - Very good idea.
I'll take the boy along in my wagon
and keep an eye on him. - Very well.
I wonder if you two would follow up
that suggestion and keep your eye...
on the Reverend, will you?
- Sure thing.
Come on, boy! Come along! Come on, folks!
Into your wagons. We're moving.
I...
Go on! Go home!
Old Surehand! Hey, look!
Hello there, buddy.
- What are you doing here? Who are you?
You can just put that over there.
This is our friend, Old Surehand.
You mean the famous Surehand?
- Yes.
It's a pleasure. Where are you taking
your wagon train? - Arizona.
Oh, no, sir. You're going
to be ambushed, right at Llano.
How do you know that?
How do you know this young man here?
Him? He's the son of my old friend,
Baumann. I knew him before he was dry...
behind the ears. I wouldn't trust
those men up there because they're going
to lead you right to their gang.
- That's a fine trick. And now?
Can I rely on your help?
- Sure. On our friends, too.
Count me in. I'd like to help.
Miss Annie! I'd forgotten all about you!
Gentlemen, we have nothing to worry about!
Come over!
The men who defiled these holy graves are
the ones who are guilty of the murders.
Trust in me. You're my brother.
Those are the men that we want.
Winnetou swears by the spirit
of your dead father to seek out...
these treacherous men
and bring them to Manitou's justice.
Manitou gives true words to the Apache.
Hand those men their weapons!
And Baumann?
He'll stay. Prepare the graveyard!
Manitou now orders us to battle...
against the enemies of our people.
Winnetou needs our force.
Let's go!
Now, did you get all that?
You ride to White Rock and tell Preston...
that we strike tonight.
- Why me? Let Rod go.
Nothing doing. The Boss wants it this way.
Anyway, Rod's sleeping. Get going!
Oh, I get all the dirty work!
Hello?
Well, well. A pretty girl's always welcome
in my wagon! Come on in!
No. Why don't you come out?
Were you asleep?
- Yeah. What is it?
Do you want to see something? - Sure.
Come on!
Help! Help! Murderers!
They're trying to attack!
- Hey, come back here!
I'd like to know what's going on!
Threatening a Reverend!
I don't understand that!Who are you, sir?
My name Surehand.
This so called Preacher and those two men
belong to a gang that are going to lead
your wagon train into an ambush.
- You're sure of the facts?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Judge! Judge, don't believe him!
Don't listen to a word!
He's a rotten liar! Ask him! Ask him!
Shh. You'll wake him.
Come here.
- Every word's a lie!
He belongs to The Vultures!
- Alright! Move!
Well, now.
Tell us who this man is.
- This is...
Mr Stewart.
Professional guide.
You sanctimonious parson!You tell the man
the truth here before I count to three,
or I'll shoot you through the head!
- No! For my sake! Don't!
One...
- I...
two...
He blackmails him into a false statement.
Don't let him get away with that.
No! No! Don't shoot!
I'm going to tell everything!
Only don't fire!
You were right. The Vultures are waiting
over at Llano. They want to ambush...
the train tonight.
They're going to do it tonight!
Murderers! I've a good mind
to forget justice and do to you
what you've done to us!
You're to blame for whatever happens!
We've got to plan things.
We have a plan.
- You want to take him? Go on!
Take him, Judge.
- Alright, you! Here, get him out!
Upsi-daisy! There.
Our friend Weller here has an appointment
with the Chief of the gang. He's going...
to tell them that it's safe to attack
the wagon train tonight, aren't you?
But he's not going to tell them that.
He's going to tell them...
it's safe to attack at dawn. No?
- One moment.
What's the difference if it's tonight,
or if it's at dawn, Surehand?
With so few men,
how can we withstand...
There's more, you see. My friend Winnetou
has promised that he'd meet us at Llano
at dawn with all of the Schoschone.
Then we have nothing to worry about.
Hey, Weller, come on!
Martin!Thank goodness
I didn't let you hang.
You said it!
Now, we...
know what we're gonna do,
don't we?
- Yeah.
Just so that we're sure, you tell me.
Well, I tell Preston
that he's not to attack until morning
because the trains are very heavily armed
and crawling with soldiers.
But when it's dawn the soldiers will be
Leaving the train, and that's when I'll
give him the go-ahead.
And?
And...
If I change a word, then you'll shoot me.
- That's good.
Really very good.
Go!
You won't forget, will you?
No, no, no. Not a word.
Don't worry. It's only Weller.
Where's your horse, Weller?
Why come here on foot?
I want to talk to you!
If I took my horse away, they'd...
He shits himself again!
- Can we attack?
Is tonight's raid safe?
- It's all off for tonight!
Nothing you can do.
The cavalry's with them.
They're leaving at dawn.
The settlers are armed.
Tonight I'll destroy their weapons.
Better start moving tomorrow.
Don't make a move tonight!
- Sounds kind of strange. He's gone loco.
Why the devil don't you come close?
I'm sick of yelling!
No, I have to get back.
They'll be getting suspicious.
He's batty!
- Oh, well.
At least we can depend on Stewy
to know what he's doing.
We'll attack in the morning, then.
Go on, turn in now.
Very good. Word perfect.
I'm proud of you!
This way.
- Sure.
Hey!
Hey, Martin! Here's your father!
Father!
Wabble! You old son of a gun!
You're kind of late getting here!
- I'm glad that I'm here, anyway!
Hey there, Jimmy! Where's Winnetou?
I see you made it!
He'll get here soon.
How about The Vultures? Any trouble yet?
Nothing but trouble! Do you want to take up
the rear? Make sure they keep up close.
I'll take the wagon.
Hello, Miss Annie!
Come on, you little shrimp! Up you go!
I don't want to help you out of a mess
like that again!You'd get yourself
captured by ants if I weren't around.
Oh!We're hunting for bandits, eh?
Listen.
If there's any difficulty out,
how about it, eh?
You couldn't hit a house. A big one.
Hold it!
I don't see them. Are they in the wagon?
- I told them to ride.
Seems to me this job
isn't going at all the way I'd like.
They might have caught Weller tonight.
- We should take a chance.
I don't like that ring they're making.
- There's nothing we can do about it.
They form that ring,
and it'll be too bad. Let's go!
Circle in! Circle in!
Put the horses in the middle! Hurry!
Halt!Turn wagon! Halt!
Alright. Now, close up, everybody!
- Get that wagon over here!
Now, bring the horses! In the middle!
- Unharness those horses! Come on!
Move them inside!
- Tell the men to get underneath!
Get ready! They're coming!
- They're coming! Ok, now! Good luck!
Hey! Come back! Come back, boy!
Come back!
What do you think you're doing, huh?
Go on!
Mr Baker! I'm coming to help!
Just wait! I'll get one!
Yippee!Three! I got three!
Polish them off, fast!
Come on! Stay back!
Get under cover!
You told us Winnetou would come here
with the Schoschones by now.
We cannot hold out any longer.
You've got to get these people out!
No matter what happens,
get them through this.
Promise to... Promise me that...
Indians! Get going!
Come on, Winnetou!
Boy!Are we glad to see you!
- Old Surehand!
Winnetou!
Come on!This way.
Weller! Get out of here!
- Go on! Scram!
Well, Baumann,
who's winning the game now?
It's not over. See?
- Go and get Surehand. Take him away.
Preacher, you're lucky.
- Go on!
Old Surehand!
- What now?
We're holding Martin Baumann.
If you want him back alive,
come and get him. Alone!
He's my boy, and I'll go and get him.
- You stay here!You heard what they said.
If you go over there, they'll kill him.
It's me they're after.
Not alone. Winnetou shall go with you.
- I want you to stay here.
Here.
Please, Old Surehand. Please.
- You're kind of fond of him, Miss Annie.
I'll bring him back.
He'll be here.
I warn you. Make a sound,
and you'll get a bullet through the head.
Surehand!
Come out, Surehand! Because, if you don't,
we're going to kill him.
Come out!
Here I am.
Hold it!
Now, gentlemen,
put your guns away. Nice and slow.
Very good.
Now, raise your hands.
Turn around, real easy.
When you're ready.
Martin!
Alright.
Martin!
Surehand! Drop your gun.
I'm not joking. If you don't,
he'll be killed. Drop that rifle.
Don't do it, Surehand! Shoot!
No.
No, maybe he's not joking.
Come closer. A little bit nearer.
Keep walking.
I want you to see his face
when he gets it.
Where is he?
- He's alright. There.
Oh, that kid!Thanks.
Martin!
Winnetou has brought the killer
of your family to you, as he promised.
There, on the ground.
- You mean, this man?
Yes.
His name's Stealing Fox.
To hide from the law, he always wore this.
Because of his name.
Proof is in your son's hands, Bear Hunter.
Her ring.
Will that make you admit it?
That the Indians did not do it.
- Yeah.
Now hatred can be put aside.
We can all be friends again.
When I'm not afraid of you.
When you're not afraid of me.
Hey!That was one lovely shot.
I learned from you, Professor.
- That thing really works? I thought,
you used it just to impress people.
- Why, you can hit someone over the head.
You said it! Come on!
Be seeing you, Baumann. Take it easy.
My regards to your father.
Thank you. I'm going to tell him
the Baumann ranch needs a woman around.
And I know just the one!
- You, huh?
Good luck!
- Well, let's go, folks.
Goodbye.
We must say farewell again.
Winnetou has seen his friend,
Old Surehand, and he is glad.
Peace, my old friend,
until we meet next time.
I hope it's soon.
Thanks for everything. Goodbye.
Judge, rest in peace, my friend.
I'll see they get to Arizona. I promise.
Alright, now! Let's go! Ride on!
We're going!
- Ride on!
