She's still there.
I didn't ask.
The hell you didn't.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
You try it.
Thanks.
I miss
breathing this air.
How can anybody
miss air?
Well, you can miss
anything,
you go without it
long enough.
Jack, that's one hell
of a horse.
See you
at the breeder's cup.
Thanks, Andy.
You bet against
your own horse?
I bet against
my father's horse.
Now, why'd
you do that?
'Cause nobody else does.
# #
What did you think
of that chestnut mare, Jack?
That Jimmy Buck's
a good stud.
I think she's gonna throw
us a winner.
Not just Woodbine,
Louisville, Kentucky,
Baltimore, Maryland,
the Big Apple.
What do you think?
I think I got too much
to do
to worry about races
that haven't been run,
by horses
that haven't been born.
Yeah, don't plan your future
around my horses, Sonny.
I got plans of my own.
I may surprise you yet, Dad.
See you
in New York, Jack.
Can't figure you missing
Saturday's race.
Yeah, you know,
Wouldn't want
to miss that.
Hey, you all set?
All set.
Careful, Sonny.
What a good dog.
What are you up to, huh?
Yeah, thanks, Paulie.
You guys heading out now,
Uncle Earl?
Yeah, we are.
Listen, I'm not gonna
be here Saturday.
I want you
to look after my horse, okay?
Don't you worry
about Flash.
You just...
you have
a good time.
Run along there,
biscuit.
There you go.
All right.
Where you been?
Jesus Christ.
I stopped for lunch,
Jackson.
Liquid lunch?
I want you
to get that roan,
get her up to the dd
in London.
Get her bred
to rambling river.
Rambling river?
Why that stud?
Dean, you show up late,
half in the bag.
You want
to ask questions?
Show up Early sometime.
We'll talk about
the business.
No, and neither are you,
Sonny.
Now go on.
Get that mare loaded.
Get her up to London.
I'm going
to woodbine.
Sonny, you can carry on
with your duties there.
Pooh.
When you runnin' him?
Claimer, Saturday,
Fort Erie.
What's he done?
Well, he won last month.
I epoxied it.
Looks all right now,
Are you racing those mares?
No, they're
finished racing.
That chestnut's
in foal.
How the hell
you making a living, Pete?
Who said I was?
I got my corn
to come off.
Could be I get another couple
of wins
out of this gelding.
Could be he'll break down again
next time out.
That's not a young horse.
You're a pessimistic
son of a bitch
Beautiful.
You think you can swing
all this?
You know we're talking about
a lot of money here.
I can't believe
you'd ask me that, rock.
Hey.
Well, if it isn't
the prodigal.
And me
with no calf to kill.
about serving a man
a rye whiskey?
Hey, Bonnie,
Dan Rockwell been in?
I've not seen
his royal highness today.
I'll have a 50, Bonnie,
and get Ray here another.
How you doing, buddy?
Never better.
I thought you were out
at the tar sands
getting rich.
I've been back
over a year.
You back farming?
Yeah, I was.
I'm a roofer these days.
Old man sold the farm,
sold it to Sonny Stanton.
Looks like Sonny wants to buy up
the whole concession.
Why the hell
would he do that?
He's no farmer.
Yeah, no shit.
What about you?
Still playing ball
down in the states?
No, I've been out of it
a couple years.
You want to lay shingles
for a living?
You can start tomorrow
if you want.
All right.
Great.
I got to hit the gents'.
How you doing, Steve?
What are you doing
here?
Shit.
Taking a leak.
Hope I'm better at it
than you.
Psycho.
Put in 44 units
in this cul-de-sac right here.
Got to be finished
in a month,
not two months, okay?
Sonny and I got
a pretty big job coming up.
Could be good for you,
Steve.
It'll be done.
Good.
This is Ray.
He's working for me.
All right.
That's Ray Dokes.
This asshole ain't working
on my site.
You're not the only
developer out there.
You can shove
your subdivision
up your ass.
Asshole.
Hey, hey, hey,
I got nothing against ex-cons.
I just don't
trust them.
Fuck you.
Heh, first free drink I've had
in a while.
I'll see you
in the morning.
What are you shooting?
Rats.
You got to stay out here.
Homer's inside.
You'll remember,
he's not your biggest fan.
How is homer, anyway?
He's fine.
He's 75.
He's bound to slow down
a little.
This place has gone to hell
in a handbasket.
You know more about that
particular destination than me.
Besides, Sonny Stanton didn't
share your point of view.
He's been trying
to buy the place.
Is homer gonna sell?
Not if I have
any say in it.
Sonny's not used
to hearing the word "no."
Well, he's gonna hear it
from me.
That's Pete Culpepper's
truck.
You sure you should be
driving
if I can smell the whiskey
from here?
Oh, I can make it
another mile or two.
Why, you worried
about me?
Not anymore, I'm not.
# #
so how's Etta?
How do you know
I saw Etta?
You got that dopey look
about you.
Looks like
she's running the place
on her own.
about how homer's got
"the olds-heimer's disease,"
though I doubt
he's any worse off
than those dimwits telling it.
Etta never said a word,
and it's "alzheimer's."
Not according to that bunch
down at the mercantile.
She visit you in jail?
No, sir.
that Sonny Stanton's
I didn't figure that information
would do you any good.
He tryin' to buy
this place too?
I wouldn't sell
that little prick
a sway back mule.
# #
Ray?
Shit.
It is you.
Wow, Ray Dokes.
Sorry to hear
you got jail time
for that little
misunderstanding.
I mean, shit.
I got no more use for Sonny
than you do.
This here's a nice horse.
What's your name, son?
Are you racing him today?
You know, I like
this animal's configuration.
I'm gonna put a few dollars
on him.
Kid seems okay.
I wouldn't trust the other one
as far as I could throw hog.
# #
John Wayne,
you got no jockey?
Tend to your own mount.
Heh.
Race is in 12 minutes.
Where you been?
I had car trouble.
What kind
of car trouble?
The kind
where I can't find it.
Give me the silks.
Meet Chrissie Nugent.
You think she's okay
on that horse?
I got a feeling
that's about
the only place she is.
That's it,
that's it.
Whoa!
You done great,
You okay?
Are you all right?
You little dick!
I ought to kill you!
I didn't do nothing,
huh?
Come on, back off.
I'm fine.
That tendon...
he won't run again.
You know that.
I'd just like
to save the animal.

Thank you.

He nodded right off?
No, the vet
gave him a shot.
He's pretty loaded.
You too.
He might sleep the night,
provided we go easy
on the bucket kicking
and cursing and such.
Fuck you.
So much
for the cursing.
Why'd you stick up
for me today?
You're a friend
of Pete's.
And what's he to you?
He's a friend
of mine.
I never had
too many friends.
I don't know the quantity's
all that important.
You know, there's plenty of room
in the house.
I want to stay
with him.

Scotch and water,
another beer for Ray.
Hello, Jack.
I heard you were back.
How's the thoroughbred
business?
Pretty good
at the moment.
I got this four-year-old,
Jumpin' Jack Flash.
Might be the best horse
in North America.
Got a bit of an attitude,
but the son of a bitch
can run.
What you are doing,
Ray?
I'm in construction
these days.
Sonny know you're back?
Yep.
I hear he's developed
a sudden interest
in agriculture.
Sonny wouldn't know
a Rhode Island rooster
from a Holstein cow.
I'm done with him,
Jack.
I know it's not
common knowledge,
but you got
a raw deal, Ray.
But that's how it is
with Sonny.
I suspect someday
it'll catch up with him.
You see,
that's one of those things
that people always say,
"what goes around
comes around."
Doesn't mean it's true.
Sonny could live
his whole life
and never have to answer
for anything.
You saying
he didn't answer to you
that day
on the golf course?
I heard he did.
The story I got was,
people would hear him answering
a half a mile away.
What do you think
you're doing?
I know what I'm doing.
Must be a strange feeling
for you.
Hey, my place is just
down the road.
You boys want to come by
for a drink?
Yeah.
Paulie, come on.
It's okay.
Yeah,
that's not so bad.
I'm becoming my own vet.
Could hang a shingle out.
Never paid
a dime on it.
I'm gonna have to sell.
If you put it on the market,
Sonny will buy it.
I won't sell it to him.
He'll just get
one of his buddies
to put in the offer
for him.
How are you gonna know?
Shit.
You have to be so smart?
First time in a while
you accused me of that.
First time in a while
you've qualified.
That's the way it is, Etta.
Money always wins.
I'm gonna go finish
fixing that roof.
I'm fixing it for you.
I think she was drugging
and doping
when she was pregnant
with Paulie.
Scrambled his brain;
you know what I mean?
He's good with animals, though,
ain't he?
That old dog ain't been off
the porch in a month.
Dogs, horses, cats.
My theory is, they sense
he's as dumb as they are,
so they all get along,
you know?
You got a lot of theories,
don't you?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah,
even when I was a kid.
It was like my brain
worked quicker
than other people's.
Right.
So Earl's a big dog
at the trough right now,
isn't he?
Doesn't hurt to be
a zillionaire.
Buy a lot of yearlings
with that kind of money.
make all the money back
on the stud fees.
A man could make a lot of money
with a top-notch stud like that.
Yeah.
You know, I know a lot of guys
with broodmares,
Looks like the old boy's
gonna make it.
What are you gonna do with him?
Well, his disposition,
he'll make somebody
a good pleasure horse.
Won't fetch much of a price
for him, though.
You would have
before the spill.
I'm not done
with that son of a bitch Romano.
Is that how you figure
to make it in this business,
cold clocking people?
He fouled me.
I had to make
a statement.
Well, you made it.
Now serve your suspension
and forget about it.
What are you,
some kind of cowboy philosopher
all of a sudden?
I'd be pretty goddamned stupid
if I hadn't learned something
by now.
He tries that again,
he'll get more of the same.
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me,
Texas?
Being as you're such
a goddamned know-it-all today.
I'd rather shovel your shit
than listen to it.

Taking Jumping Jack Flash down
to New York city tomorrow.
Running in the biggest race
on the planet, huh, Paulie?
If you care to watch,
you might catch me on TV.
I'll be sure to set my VCR.
Ugh.
My god.
You boys got
better taste
than I ever
would have imagined.
This is the guy?
Yeah, Sonny Stanton,
legend in his own mind.
That's Dean Calder,
vice president
in charge of shoveling shit
at the Stanton stables.
Yeah, he shovels it,
he's full of it,
and when I tell him to,
he eats it.
What you do to your leg,
Sonny Stanton?
Used to rodeo a bit
in my younger days.
Hooked up
with a 1,500-pound Brahma
one night out in Calgary.
A little
out of my weight class.
Looks to me
like you're still
out of your class.
Now, what would you know
about class?
Tell me something.
Are you an asshole
because you're rich,
or are you rich
because you're an asshole?
Works both ways, baby.

Appreciation
for roof repair.
So who's Annie Oakley?
Name's Chrissie Nugent.
She's this jock
for Fort Erie.
She rides for Pete
when he's got a horse to run.
What does she do
the rest of the time?
If you don't want to make
applejack out of this.
Well, you can do
what you want with it.
I'll see you around.
Say hi to Pete.
Why don't you stick around
and say hi yourself?
No, you're busy.
You've got fat horses
and pretty girls to tend to.
I told you, she's a jock
who rides for Pete.
Only you could turn up a jock
Well, I'm just fortunate,
I guess.
What?
She wasn't a horsewoman.
She was a sharpshooter.
Thanks for the history lesson,
Mr. Dokes.
Is that the one?
The one what?
The one you're thinking about
when you're fucking me.
Get up.
Lawyers are here.
Right.
Your father's in worse shape
than we thought.
Tell them a story,
Jack.
Tell them I was up all night
with a sick mare.
He's coming.
He's been up
all night drinking.
Sorry, I was up
half the night.
We heard.
So you talked
to the doctor again?
There's no change,
at least not
in your father's condition,
and until he regains
consciousness, we're...
he's broccoli; that's what
you're here to tell me.
Well, your stepmother's taken
power of attorney.
What?
No, she can't do that,
that scheming little bitch.
She signed a prenup.
Well, ordinarily,
you'd be right,
but it's a little tricky.
See, he's had a stroke.
He's not dead,
So until we get this
all sorted out,
all assets are frozen:
Bank accounts, everything.
Well, get him home.
I mean today.
He's in a coma, Sonny.
You can't put him
on a plane.
Yeah, well, you fucking well
find a way.
Yeah, that's your little job
for today, boys.
Call me
when it's done.
So what's going on?
I thought
you were gonna fly down?
Earl always trusted me
to trailer the Flash.
Well, Earl's not making
decisions right now, Dean.
I'm taking the horse
to New York.
You and Paulie finish up
the new stalls.
I'm good enough to haul horses
all over Ontario,
but I'm not good enough
to take the Flash to New York?
I'm not building stalls
for fucking Sonny.
Suit yourself.
You got other options?
Maybe ford's
looking for a new CEO, Dean.
Maybe there's an opening
at the corner of piss and moan.
What are you doing up?
Shit the bed?
Did you actually think
I was gonna let
my two retarded cousins
take my million-dollar horse
for a joyride, Dean?
Hey, Jackson.
You should have been down
at the slam Dance last night.
Sonny boy was telling my girl
how he got stomped
by a Brahma bull.
Yeah, seems to me that bull's
name was Ray Dokes,
wasn't it, Sonny?
Wasn't that bull's name
Ray Dokes?
You're finished, Dean.
Jackson, write him a check,
get him out of here,
and that other half-wit too.
Do it now, Jackson.
You dumb
son of a bitch.
Who the hell do you think
you are, anyway?
I'm gonna talk to him
about Paulie,
but you brought this
on yourself, Dean.
You're always whining
about respect.
Well, the more you whine
about it,
the less likely you are
to get it.
Nothing but a damn punk,
Dean.
Jesus, what did you do,
Dean?
We just got fired.
Well, I'm fine with that,
but we put our time
in here.
We're taking the Flash
as severance.
No, we got to help
Jackson.
No, don't worry.
Black guys got harder heads
than white guys.
It's been proved.
Come on,
we got to get out of here.
I got a plan.
It's a doozy.
After the new year.
This horse needs
some exercise.
I can't for the life of me
figure how you managed
before I came along,
Texas.
Come on.
Ain't she
a pain in the ass?
If I was 20 years younger,
I'd fight you for her.
# #
# #
Well, I got you the best
goddamned four-year-old
on the continent.
to set up a stud service?
I'm way
ahead of you.
I'm talking about
artificial semination.
I'm gonna take
this horse's sperm,
and I'm gonna
sell it.
They don't do that
with thoroughbreds.
But they can.
I've been reading
up on it,
and you know what else?
They can freeze
the stuff.
I figured we take a gallon
or so out of the stud,
and we'll enough
we can retire on.
How do you think the horse feels
about all this?
Christ, they think they can sell
that damn horse?
Even Dean knows better
than that.
It would be like trying
to sell the
Well, I think we can assume
Dean won't be taking the nag
to Belmont.
I think we can assume
we won't be winning
the classic on Saturday.
Seems highly unlikely
at this point.
I bet you Gena's got
the bank accounts frozen.
I got expenditures.
I could drop you off
at the employment center.
That whack on your head turn you
into a comedian, Jack?
I'm gonna enter
rather rambunctious
in the Stanton Stakes
down at Fort Erie .
No, no chance, Sonny.
He's never run a horse
in that race,
and he never will.
Well, I'm gonna do it.
Who cares
about the small owners?
Only two people can enter
a horse in that race.
Earl is one.
I'm the other.
It's not gonna happen, Sonny.
What are you asking?
It's a Massey 135.
It's a good tractor.
It'll be
about 2,500 bucks.
I'll take it.
I can give you 500 now.
I'll pay you the rest
by the end of the month or so.
Jesus, I've become
a charity case.
What are you
talking about?
I need a tractor.
You need
a lot of things, Ray.
Put your money away.
So that's it.
You're gonna sell the place
piece by piece.
Either that,
or the whole thing to Sonny.
Well, you won't do that.
That's the one thing
I'm sure about.
Sonny's got a lot
on his plate these days.
I hear somebody stole his
million-dollar racehorse.
What kind of lunatic
would do a thing like that?
Jesus, look at the cock on him.
Hold on a minute.
Shit!
Get that mare out of here.
Well, at least we know
we can do it.
Oh, yeah.
That went real good.
Don't be so
goddamn negative.
All right,
so if getting rich was easy,
everyone
would be a millionaire.
You settle that horse,
Paulie.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Jesus Christ,
Sonny.
Don't tell me you've come
to pay me my five grand.
Bloody Mary.
I've got bad news for you,
Billy.
And here are the winners.
Hmm.
What are you...
come on.
That's what I'm talking about.
that's all right.
That's all right.
Ah.
Well, guess
I've been kicked enough
for one day.
I'll be in first of the week
to settle.
You're telling me you lost
$100,000 on a marker,
and you don't have it?
No, I don't.
I don't carry
that kind of cash.
Well, then you shouldn't
be betting that kind of cash.
I  see you next week.
# #
thanks.
Figuring how to buy
a new pickup?
Shit.
Money from my corn
won't even cover the feed,
never mind
the damn taxes.
I don't suppose you could buy
this place from me?
I got no money
to buy anything.
Too bad, this place being
such a moneymaker and all.
Where you going, anyway?
Well, I believe there's
a woman out west Texas
might still be agreeable
to my company.
You figure
she's still waiting on you?
I have quite an effect
on the ladies.
I never told you that?
Oh, I've heard it
from you plenty of times.
I just never heard it
from a woman.
Hello, there.
What can I do for you?
So you decided to sell.
You could say
I'm entertaining offers
from farmers.
And if I see some shithead
pull up into my drive
pretending
to be a cash cropper,
I'm gonna know
who he's working for.
Why can't we
just get along?
I'd settle
for half of that.
Why don't you get along?
This offer's better
than market value.
I didn't have to do that,
Etta.
You think it over.
Your psycho boyfriend
gonna make you a better offer?
'Cause that
was very immature.
How about this?
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you, nuts?
Ah.
Jesus.
Did you hear bones
is playing ball down in Texas?
Yeah, why?
No reason, I guess.

those two morons
did the right thing
and killed the nag.
You want to kill
your own horse?
"Maybe it'll win some races
next year"?
"Maybe it'll be a good stud"?
Dead, it's worth $10 million,
rock.
I'll take that
over a bunch of goddamn maybes.
Look, you kill that horse,
it's gonna look like
an insurance scam.
You don't shoot it, rock.
Jesus.
All you need is some wires
and a couple
of alligator clips.
What is this,
amateur hour?
As long as you get the money.
I don't care how you do it.
Keep an eye
on that boy tonight.
He could have
a concussion.
Where's your girlfriend?
If you're talking about
Chrissie,
she hitched a ride
to town.
The hell
were you doing, Ray?
Why can't you
keep away from him?
I couldn't figure out
a way to do that tonight, Etta.
Pete's been talking about
going back to Texas.
I'm thinking
I might tag along.
I think you should.
So everyone just throws
in the towel.
Is that the way it is?
It's like you said,
Ray.
Money always wins.
# #
everything comes to an end.
That's what I keep hearing.
Thing is
to recognize it.
Sometimes stubborn
is the same as stupid.
I guess that all depends
on your point of view.
Guess maybe it does.
Well, I'm going to bed.
One way or another,
tomorrow's another day.
I'm real glad
Sonny didn't shoot you.
Yeah, me too.
Put on your coat, kid.
We're going for a ride.
Sonny.
Jesus.
You almost gave me
a heart attack.
Jim burns,
we met at woodbine once.
Fascinating.
Now get the hell
off my property.
I know
where your horse is.
Really?
All right.
Step into my office.
If you want something done
around here,
you just
got to do it yourself.
Mm.
I wasn't aware I was running
a bed and breakfast here.
Oh, you mean the kid?
I figured he should stick around
a couple days
for safekeeping.
I'm talking about
that big bay stallion
in my barn.
I also will assume
you intend to trailer him
I intend to trailer him over
at some point,
but not this morning.
First I got to set
something straight.
Maybe setting things straight
ain't exactly your strong suit.
Son of a bitch just tried
to take my head off.
He likes green apples.
So that's it?
They drop the charges,
you return the horse?
Might be a little more
to it than that.
A man needs a project, Pete.
You're the one
told me that.
I need to learn
to keep my damn mouth shut.
You hear anything
about the Flash?
Yep, I hear he's
in the states.
I hear he's in Europe.
I hear he's in 5,000 cans
of Alpo dog food.
I hear all kinds
of things.
What's the insurance saying,
Jack?
Insurance isn't gonna pay
a claim on a horse
that's just missing.
If the animal
turns up dead,
they'll pay.
I hope they never pay.
I want the horse back.
I'll take the money
myself.
I know what you did,
Sonny.
You could be arrested.
It's forgery.
Hey, my father's sick.
I'm looking after
the family business.
You never looked after anybody
but yourself.
Rather rambunctious
is entered,
and he's gonna run,
so get over it.
Where is he, anyway?
He's in the barn.
That's where we keep
the horses, Sonny.
He's not ready to run.
Well,
I'll get him ready.
No,
you stay away from him.
I'll do it.
You stay away from him,
and you stay
the hell away from me.
Lighten up, Jack.
they could be
out of the same mare.
And one's worth
a few thousand
and the other
a few million.
And the one worth millions
got the personality
of a damn cactus.
I woke up this morning;
kid had all my chores done.
He's gonna put you
in a rocking chair, Pete.
You see the change
in him already?
Hell, all I did was give him
an old hat,
and now he thinks
I'm the second coming.
he's no better
than a horse turd.
Well, I'm no saint,
and neither are you,
but I'd like to show him
that the Sonny Stantons
in the world
don't always come out
on top.
That's about
the longest speech
I ever heard
you make, Pete.
You're not gonna
make a habit of it, are you?
Nope.
Good-looking horse
you got in the corral, Pete.
Yeah, he's just passing through,
that one.
Bet he is.
Now I know what kind
of a lunatic
would steal
a million-dollar racehorse.
Hey, Pete.
We're looking
for Paulie Stanton.
We heard he might
be staying here.
He's here.
with that missing racehorse
from Stanton stables,
so we're gonna
have to search the premises.
I'm not in the habit
of boarding stolen horses.
Well, we'll take a look
just the same.
What are you looking at?
I'm taking a walk.
Anyone tries
to follow me,
I think we'd better
have a look around.
Horse might be setting
on the couch
watching
Come on,
come on.
Heya.
We had to follow up,
Pete.
I understand.
Happy to help.
Something I can do for you,
Pete?
I never figured you
to call the cops.
What are you talking about?
Ray didn't steal that horse.
Do you think I'd turn him in?
You might.
You got an awful horn
in your gut over that boy.
Past tense.
And I don't mean
to be rude,
but I got work to do.
You know, Etta,
there's more to this
than meets the eye.
Ray was the guy, Pete.
He was the guy,
and he fucked it up.
Well, I just thought
you should know.
Ray might not be back
this way again.
# #
hey.
So I was talking
to Pete...
you were talking
to Pete,
and now you're here
to tell me
what Pete
already told me
and what
you wouldn't tell me.
That it, Ray?
Well, it sounded better
when I was rehearsing
on the way in.
Yeah, I bet it did.
Etta, I let you down.
Yeah, you're fucking right,
you let me down.
But I let you down too,
so let's call it even?
I can be happy with that.
Okay, if I ask you
what you're gonna do
with that horse,
am I gonna regret it?
I'd say there's a good
possibility of that.
What are you gonna do
with that horse?
If this is about the Flash,
forget it.
Somebody stole him back.
Can't trust anybody
these days.
We stole him.
What do you know
about it, idiot?
Keep the name-calling
to yourself.
What's this about?
Don't ask questions.
I want to know
what's going on.
Don't ask questions,
Dean.
# #
Yeah?
Yeah.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Right.
Who's Frank Hamer?
Texas lawman
from days of yore.
He's dead now.
So are we
if we get found out.
How's the gray doing?
Then watch people talk.
To hell with them.
My horse;
I run him when I want.
I picked up the entries.
Three scratches already.
Well, that's what happens
when you drop
a horse like this down.
Mm-hmm.
The owners want to know
they have a chance to win.
What's this?
"Horse in the four-hole,
Fast Market."
Nine years old.
Some outfit
out of Pecos River.
No law against dreaming,
Sonny.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I got some skank
I have to straighten out.
Don't want to keep you
from your important chores,
Sonny.
# #
I think we can resolve
this without involving the cops.
I've already involved
the cops.
I could have
done it different.
I could have
your fucking legs broken.
I could make a phone call,
and they'd never
find your bones, jerk-off.
I think I'm getting
the point here.
What do you want?
Five grand to start.
Cover my lost wages.
Five grand?
All right.
Then you're gonna
make a bet for me.
I hear Billy Caan's got some
backroom totes at a club.
The odds are a lot.
Maybe.
You're gonna put $1,000
on a horse called Fast Market
for me,
eighth race,
Stanton Stakes.
He's gonna lose
by 50 lengths.
Did I ask you
your opinion?
Where's the grand?
In your pocket,
dipshit.
Bring the ticket to the bar
at the racetrack Saturday.
When I have it in my hand,
I'll drop the charges.
Let me guess.
You got my 100 grand.
I want to make a bet
in the Stanton Stakes.
Man, you got balls
like a bull moose.
Hope you're not looking
for credit.
Cash,
a thousand to win
on the four horse,
Fast Market.
And I'll have what I owe you
first of the week.
That's a 99-to-1 shot.
Ain't you guys running
that gray?
Oh, the gray's gonna win.
Throwing away a thousand bucks.
How you doing?
Never better.
Bloody Mary.
Yeah.
nice ass,
maybe a little swelling
around one eye?
No.
All right,
I got to go to the paddock
If she shows, I'm not here,
you give her this ticket.
She's a bit of a tramp.
Imagine my surprise.
Thanks.
All right, I've got
to wish my horse luck.
Not that he's gonna need it.
Hi, Sonny.
What are you doing here?
I was thinking
about your offer.
I'm here to negotiate.
Yeah, I'm gonna see
to my horse.
Why?
I mean, I would have thought
that you're a guy
who has his priorities
in order.
Two bourbons.
Look out, bitch.
I hope you like
my ass, Juan.
'Cause in about two minutes,
that's all you're gonna see.
Attagirl.
The four.
Hold on.
I just happen
to have $1,000
down at the club.
to the French broad.
And what's that for?
I think a man should get kissed
when he gets fucked.
Hell of a horse
for a nine-year-old.
He's got a bit
of an attitude,
but the son of a bitch
can run.
Good-looking animal.
You switched them in the tunnel.
I don't know
what you're talking about, Jack.
I had a horse like this once.
I lost him.
Well, chances are,
he'll find his way home.
Let's make sure he does.
Peter?
Young lady.
That was quite a stunt
in there.
If you're smart,
you'll make damn sure
it never happens again.
If you were smart,
you'd have me riding for you.
Call me Monday morning.
Shit.
# #
Are we okay?
Yeah, we are.
You better hope
the racing commission
doesn't find out.
Well, I figure
if Stanton stables
don't complain,
no one else will.
Sonny might
if he figures it out.
I have it
on good authority
that Sonny won
a large chunk of cash
on yesterday's race.
I'm pretty sure
he won't want his bookie
to find out
it was a fix.
Earl just got out
of the coma.
He's not gonna like
what he's coming home to.
Isn't Earl used to Sonny
fucking up by now?
You always know
when you've won.
Your horse
crossed the finish line first.
You're the winner.
No need to second-guess yourself
on that.
I'll give you 50 grand
for that tractor.
You think too much.
Take the "for sale" sign
down.
Sonny hasn't got enough money
to build a mini putt.
You and Mr. Culpepper
are going to Texas?
Yeah, probably a good idea
for us to clear out.
It wasn't exactly
the perfect crime we pulled.
Pete gonna sell the farm?
Funny thing,
Pete's old gelding
won the Stanton Stakes
at Fort Erie the other day.
You don't say.
Yeah, made enough money
to pay off his taxes
and a few other bills.
Chrissie's gonna look
after the place
for the time being.
Paulie's gonna help out.
And what about
your tractor?
I was thinking
you'd hold on to it for me.
That mean
you're coming back?
I was thinking I might
when things cool off.
What makes you think
things are gonna cool off?
Do what you have to do.
Just don't take too long
doing it.
hey, Billy.
I woke up this morning
and remembered,
"damn, I owe you 100 grand."
But I got this ticket here
that says you owe me 100 grand.
So I guess
that makes us even, Billy.
I heard a rumor
you got the Flash back.
Oh, he's back.
None the worse for wear,
according to Jackson.
That's what I was curious about,
Sonny...
when you got him back.
Now, you were saying something
about the 100 grand you owe me?
# #
# Tell me, baby,
one more time #
# don't make me sit
all alone and cry #
# well it's over #
# I know it,
but I can't let go #
# I'm like a fish
out of water #
# a cat in a tree #
# you don't even
want to talk to me #
# well, it's over #
# I know it,
but I can't let go #
# he won't take me back

like a train wreck #

# #
# well, it's over #
# I know it,
but I can't let go #
