Whiskey.
We ain't got
no whiskey.
Cold beer.
We ain't got
no cold beer.
What are they
drinking?
Warm beer.
Give me
a warm beer.
How far is it
to tombstone?
Hey, cowboy,
how far to tombstone?
Who wants
to know?
Bartender:
This gentleman here.
He want to know
how far to tombstone.
Depends
Whether he can
ride or not.
Maybe a day,
maybe three days.
For a dude,
maybe a month.
You a gambler,
cowboy?
Yeah.
I gamble, dude.
Play you
for the lady.
I ain't gonna play
for the lady.
Why not?
'cause me and her's
in love.
I'm gonna take her out to
the ranch. Have a big wedding.
Raise cattle. Live happy ever after.
You're talking cow shit,
ike clanton.
Let's play one hand.
Five-card stud.
My horse
against your, uh,
Lady.
You don't
own me, ike.
Then let's say
I done rented you.
yeah.
Why don't you play the
gentleman for the rent?
Sit down, dude.
Hey, bring us
some cards.
Bartender: We ain't
got no cards.
I got some cards.
you don't think I'd play
with your cards, do you?
Look them over.
I guess
they look okay.
Let's let the lady
cut for deal.
She cut for you first,
then for me.
Pair of tens.
You can reach for it
if you want to, cowboy.
But if you do, you're gonna
end up with two assholes,
And one of them is gonna
be right between your eyes.
Now, get the hell
out of here.
I'll see you
in tombstone, dude.
Could be.
Got a room?
In there.
Let's go.
The name's john holliday.
Doc, some people call me.
Kate elder.
I'm gonna need
a tub of hot water.
We ain't got
no hot water.
God damn it, build a
fire and heat some water!
I gotta wash
this bitch.
Where are you
going, dude?
Tombstone. I gotta see
somebody there.
Woman?
No. A friend.
I'm ready.
This is the ass end
of the west, doc.
It ain't even
got a name.
I had a ride to tombstone with
that clanton. At least that far.
You busted that up.
You won me.
Look, lady, where I go, I go
alone. I don't travel with anybody.
Okay.
Let's go.
That's $3.50 you owe me
for the food and the room.
Doc: 3.50?
Here's four.
Keep the change.
Doc, when are we
gonna get some water?
Not till we see the mountains.
We got a long ride yet.
Now we can have
some water.
Thank jesus.
Son of a bitch.
It's vinegar.
Mexican greaser.
Vinegar.
Oh, doc.
Come on now, we got to save our energy.
We got a long ride
to those mountains.
Kate: Bastard. Still
fighting the mexican war.
doc...
Doc...
it's you.
Where are we?
Mountains.
We should be in tombstone
tomorrow afternoon,
If we are
where I think we are.
We got something
to eat?
Well, there's some salt beef and
beans right there next to the fire.
Beans
make you fart.
well,
just stay away from me.
Bastard.
Whore.
Killer.
What do you mean,
"killer"?
I figured you
for a gunfighter
The minute you walked into
that pigsty back there.
The way you walked with your
right hand hanging loose.
The way you looked around
the room like there was
A rattler hiding
in the pickle barrel.
A little baby gun
you keep in your vest.
Been on the line
four years, doc.
Gotta learn something.
I ain't killed a man
in a long time.
I ain't screwed a man
since I was 12.
You cleaned me up. You
got real doctor's hands.
Dentist's.
Dentist?
Yeah. I was
a dentist once.
What do you
think of that?
Any good?
Well, it's not bad.
Good.
Doc?
I ain't never done it
in the mountains before.
Now, look, we gotta start
early in the morning.
Good night.
Mean,
Rat-livered,
Heartless,
lonesome creature.
Listen,
katie elder...
What?
If you're gonna break wind,
would you turn the other way?
'cause you're aimed right at the
fire, and you might blow us both up,
And I've got to get
to tombstone.
Suck grass.
"lonesome. "
Straighten up,
woman.
You gonna get your picture took, doc?
Could be.
Is that your friend, the
one you're looking for?
That's probably
the mayor.
Some of your friends?
Oh, just a few
working girls, doc.
Servants for
the likes of you.
She looks like she does most
of her serving with her mouth.
End of the
line, kate.
Much obliged.
See you
around, dude.
Hey, curly. Howdy, pretty lady.
You a prospector?
That's right.
Why don't you stick with
me? I'll bring you luck.
Man: New girl in town!
the name's kate.
Man: Hey, you staying for a while?
Well, if this town's got
any action, I'm staying.
Man: Where are
you going?
Kate: Right across the square.
Come round, the name is kate.
Open up, sisters!
Back to work.
I'll need a bottle
of whiskey, a bath
And a place
to put my horse.
I'll have a boy
take care of that.
Do you know
wyatt earp?
The marshal?
Tell him
doc's in town.
Hello, wyatt.
Hello, john.
Let's go get a drink.
Five whiskeys
here.
Tonight's the night we teach the
kid how to drink some rye whiskey.
Oh, leave the kid alone, ike. He don't
drink whiskey. He don't even like beer.
Johnny ringo.
Oh, concha!
Maybe what the kid really needs
Is to get his
pole greased.
Me, oh, my!
Fresh meat!
That's something concha
knows how to treat good, huh?
Come on, let me see it. Let me see it!
No, concha's not gonna hurt you, baby.
concha...
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
Hello, cowboy.
Hello, dude.
Play some cards?
Excuse me,
gentlemen.
Mmm?
Oh.
Ike: Son
of a bitch!
Forget it, ike! He's packing and you ain't!
I see
you've met ike.
I ran into him.
What's that
all about?
Ike, his
brother billy.
Frank mclowery,
his kid brother.
Little guy's johnny ringo. Troublemakers.
They trying to make
trouble for you?
For anybody. They're
bad people, john.
Well, if it weren't
for bad people,
What would you do
for a living, marshal?
Tell me about tombstone. I mean,
more than what you said in the letter.
It's wide open.
The sheriff here,
johnny behan,
Doesn't know how
to organize a town.
So I'm going to run
against him in the election.
The sheriff's got
all the power here.
The marshal's got a badge,
he's got some territory,
But he's got no jurisdiction in the town.
Gambling's heavy.
There's a lot of money
around. It's wide open.
So you organize the
gambling. Start right here.
I run the law,
you run the gambling.
We'll both
end up rich.
Very rich.
We sound like
bad people, wyatt.
We are, john.
A little game,
companero?
And 10 more.
Man: Whoo!
Ike: Puta! Puta! My
little fort griffin puta!
Hello, ike.
Come back to see old ike, did you?
Well, not quite.
Let me see those cheetahs, lovebird.
You better get a note from
your ma first, burro brain.
Come here, bitch!
You stay out of this.
Outside.
You take off them guns,
get rid of that badge,
And I'll see if
you're man enough
To take me
outside, earp!
Another time,
ike. Move!
Come on! I'm gonna stay a while, ringo.
Okay, but you
watch your ass,
Because that wyatt earp
ain't right in his head.
Your five,
And 20 more.
Very impressive.
Plays a nice game.
Nice to see you,
miss kate.
Hello, kid.
How are you?
Mr. Earp?
Mr. Holliday.
I'll be right back.
Get him, virgil!
Come on! Get in there!
You got him, boy.
Come on.
Come on. Come on, we've
got people coming in an hour.
Push it. Push it.
You got him.
Come on, let's
straighten up.
Just a little
bit more.
James, virgil, morgan.
Howdy, brother.
We got people coming
in an hour.
You know, maybe we should've put
the pigs somewhere else for the day.
You mean
virgil and morgan?
Let's go
get a drink.
Hi, mark,
how you doing?
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you.
I'm gonna try.
Thank you.
It's not an easy thing to ask a man who's
carried a gun all his life to give it up.
That's pretty much it. Pretty much,
I guess, the way we'll conduct it,
Just getting everybody
around, talking to them.
Excuse my hand.
Thank you very much.
He's the fastest, and I'd
say he's the deadliest,
And I'd say he's
about the best.
Boy: All dressed in black,
pa. All in black.
That's really
doc holliday?
Man 1: That's him, son. Take
a good look and remember.
James, say hello
to john.
Hello, james.
Bless you, doc.
Man 2: I see earp has
brought in the artillery.
He sure must want
them clantons bad.
Man 3: What
do you mean?
Man 2: I encountered him in dodge.
Him and wyatt killed
a lot of people.
He's wyatt's
heavy guns.
Man 3: If holliday's
as good as I hear,
The clantons better start
thinking about moving on.
Mattie?
Hello, mattie.
doc holliday!
Man 4: How old
a man is he?
Man 5: Hard telling.
Talk says he's got the
consumption, had it for years.
Talk says he's
already dying.
Fears no one in a fight 'cause
he's got nothing to lose.
Man 4: Do you
believe the talk?
Till I see
otherwise.
Wyatt: My friend, john
holliday. Sheriff johnny behan.
Doc.
Sheriff.
When you
leaving town?
But try
some of this.
Here's the man who supplied the whiskey.
Owner of the alhambra.
Bartlett, john holliday.
Nice to meet
you, doc.
Just a small campaign
contribution, wyatt.
Mattie: Wyatt!
Well, I'll leave you in
his hands for just a second.
Mattie is calling me.
I'll be right back.
Mattie:
Thank you, dear.
Doc, say hello
to mr. Clum,
The editor of the local
newspaper, the tombstone epitaph.
How long you planning
to stay in town?
Well, that depends.
On what?
Excuse me, now.
James.
son of a bitch.
Is there a chinaman
in town?
Yeah, at the end
of allen street.
Thanks.
Good night, sir.
Good night, wong.
Go with god,
as mexicans say.
I will. I will.
Kid: Mr. Holliday.
Hey!
It's me,
mr. Holliday.
Jesus christ, kid!
You almost got
your head blown off.
Listen, if you're gonna call
a man from the dark like that,
You better plan
on killing him.
Sorry,
mr. Holliday.
My uncles would go crazy if
they saw me talking to you.
Who?
Ike and billy
clanton.
They think wyatt earp brought
you into town to kill them.
Listen, kid, you go
tell your uncles
That doc holliday
is a gambler.
I don't kill people
for other people.
There's gonna be
trouble, mr. Holliday.
Not with me
there isn't.
Lots of trouble.
Wyatt don't like
ike clanton, or us.
I ain't sure why, but
there's gonna be bad trouble.
And that's why I came
to see you, mr. Holliday.
I want you to teach me how to shoot.
Why?
So you and your uncles
can kill wyatt better?
Hmm?
Or me?
Oh, no, mr. Holliday.
I'd never kill you.
Forget about guns.
Ike promised my mother
before she died
That he'd never let me
be a gunfighter.
So if drinking's
all right,
And punching cattle's
all right,
But shooting
ain't...
I gotta learn,
mr. Holliday.
Why'd you come after me,
and not somebody else?
'cause they say you're the best there is.
'cause I read all about you in
them dime novels, mr. Holliday.
'cause...
'cause you're
a legend.
All right, kid.
Now, wait...
Hold it, now.
Kid, you'd be
dead by now.
I mean, fanning's all
right. It's very fast,
But it's not
very accurate.
And accuracy is much
more important than speed.
You see,
the important thing is
To get your arm
all the way out,
So you have the target
right in your sights.
That's important.
And the other important thing is
to relax, so you can concentrate.
Okay.
Take your time.
That's good!
That's real good!
Nice shot.
Let's go home.
You know, sometimes I feel
like a goddamn school teacher.
Who taught you,
mr. Holliday?
My daddy.
Is he still alive?
No, no.
He went off
to fight in the war.
When they lost, that just about killed him.
By the time he got home,
everything he knew was gone,
Including me.
Where did you go?
Oh, I went up
to richmond first.
Then to baltimore.
My mother sent me up
there to get an education.
Do you, uh...
Sure.
Yeah, I studied
dentistry up there.
And then they told me that
I had to come to the west.
The doctors.
For my health.
After that, I ended up at fort griffin,
Then went
to dodge.
I've been all over.
D'you ever
go home?
every night.
Pistol-whip anybody
today, marshal?
Don't try me, ike.
One of these days,
I'm gonna have
to try mr. Earp.
Well, hello, dude.
You want to dance?
Man: Let's go.
God!
What time
you got, bartlett?
Just after 2:00.
Doc: Kate!
Where the hell is kate?
She's working.
Kate! Quiet! You'll wake the dead!
Kate!
excuse me, sir.
Come on, bitch,
get off your back.
What the hell
are you doing,
You son of a bitch? You're coming with me!
You crazy son of a bitch!
You put me down!
Take it easy.
Take it easy, now.
You... You crazy
son of a bitch!
That's right.
Come on, old girl.
No... I ain't got no
clothes on! I can't go...
Can't go down the street
with no clothes on!
Concha! Concha, get the law after this...
You crazy son of a bitch, put me down!
Concha, I love you!
Good luck, darling.
Doc holliday,
you bastard!
What the hell
is this?
You're off the line, kate.
I just retired you.
I'll see you
in the morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
This is for you.
What's... What's the
matter? Don't you like it?
It's beautiful.
it's beautiful.
You like it?
You really like it?
I love it.
Come on, put it on.
Okay.
Um,
I better take
a bath first.
Well, hurry up,
though, 'cause
We got places to go.
Wyatt: What do
you think?
I like it.
Okay, take it over
to the printer.
Morning.
Morning, wyatt.
Katie.
Morning, wyatt.
Come on.
Well,
Here it is.
Territorial prison in yuma
wouldn't suit us better.
Now, listen, a man's home is his castle.
Shit.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Uh...
Uh, no, no.
Katie, wait, wait...
We got to do this right.
Somebody's going
to see us, kate! Wait...
that's
for backing out!
What if somebody
would have seen us? What...
Nice!
That son of a bitch.
What?
What's the
matter, doc?
The man who rented
this place to me
Promised he'd have it
cleaned before we moved in.
Well, clean, that's
the least of our...
We can have this place
cleaned in an hour, doc,
I mean, that's not a
problem. How's the bed?
Mmm.
It's a good bed.
Yeah.
Sturdy. Yeah.
It's big enough
for a midget.
you're
pretty skinny, dude.
Look at this place.
It's a mess!
Get some curtains up here,
get this window fixed,
It's all right.
And we got a table.
I'm sorry, kate.
I should have looked at the
place before I signed the deal.
Doc.
It's gonna be fine.
Wyatt: John?
he's asleep.
Will you wake him up,
please? It's important.
doc holliday?
Mmm-hmm?
Your friend wyatt's
at the door.
I know.
Get up.
Just a second, wyatt,
be right there.
Wyatt.
Someone held up the stage.
Got the gold shipment.
$80,000.
Eighty...
Want to go
after them?
I'll be right
with you.
Darling?
Yeah?
Can you give
me a hand?
Sure.
I've got to go.
Okay.
You don't mind,
do you?
No. I...
Tracks southwest, toward
the clanton spread.
Ike clanton?
It wouldn't be
ike clanton.
More likely
johnny ringo.
Billy: What the hell's
happening, kid?
Trouble, by the look of it.
Ike!
God damn it, ike,
what'd you do that for?
Ringo!
Where is that half-breed
son of a bitch?
Ain't seen him
in a couple of days.
Might be down in the
valley with the herd. Why?
'cause somebody held up the
gold shipment, that's why.
For $80,000,
that's why!
And sure as shit the law's gonna
be coming out here looking for us!
That's why!
Well, get off your asses and find him!
Hey, ike?
Got a couple of visitors,
way down in the draw.
Well, get
out of sight!
Get guns. Get hid.
Give me your gun.
I don't like it.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm gonna give you
fair warning, marshal.
Get off
of my ranch.
Looking for some
wells fargo gold,
And the man
who stole it.
Nobody here had anything
to do with that gold.
Now, we don't steal money.
Where's
johnny ringo?
I ain't seen him.
You're a liar,
ike.
A little different,
ain't it?
Marshal.
I'm gonna try you.
you ain't so much
without them guns,
Are you, earp?
You ain't shit.
That's enough, ike!
I ain't finished!
He is.
Get him the hell
out of here.
I'm gonna kill him.
Let it go, wyatt.
I'm gonna have
to kill him.
Forget it, wyatt,
it's over.
I'm gonna
kill him, john.
Where in the hell
you been, brother?
We thought
you was bushwhacked.
Morgan: Glad
you're back, wyatt.
Wells fargo offered a $20,000
reward for the holdup men.
Is that right?
Morgan: $20,000.
Yeah.
You go in and get us something to eat.
I'm hungry.
Want something
to eat?
I better go home
To kate.
James.
Virgil?
Yeah?
Is ike clanton
in town?
He's down at alhambra
right this minute.
Tell him
I want to see him.
Tell him I want to make
a deal with him.
What kind of deal?
Ike didn't hold up
the stage.
It's johnny ringo.
I want him.
You tell ike if he can
lead us to where ringo is,
He can have
the reward.
What the hell for?
Ike gets the money,
We get the credit,
We get the election.
Then we'll clean up
tombstone.
You mean clean out tombstone.
Go see clanton.
hello.
My god.
You like it,
flat ass?
Yes. I like it.
I got you a present.
For me?
It's a nightshirt.
What's it...
Um, special occasions?
you sweet bitch.
Come on,
break it up.
Man: Who the hell
are you?
I'm the marshal. You
boys are going to jail.
Hell we are!
Pick up your friend.
Let's go.
Wyatt. Starting to take the easy ones?
Kate: How did you get
to be a gambler, doc?
Just something I picked up along the way,
Like everything else.
How did you end up
on the line?
I was born to it.
You mean, working girls are born, not made?
no.
Nothing fancy. My ma was a whore, is all.
Did you ever meet
your father?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
No, my ma said before
she died he was a cowboy.
I rolled around
with a lot of cowboys.
Afternoon, doc.
Afternoon, mr. Clum.
Going to the big
debate tonight?
I haven't really
thought about it.
Tell me, uh,
Why do you think wyatt wants
to be sheriff of tombstone?
He's already deputy marshal
of the whole territory.
You tell me.
Money?
How come johnny behan
isn't a rich man?
He's dumb.
He's honest.
You don't think
wyatt's honest?
Nope.
Oh, no.
What are you doing? He
was pushing me around!
What are
you doing?
Give me
that gun, boy.
Tim mccoy, marshal.
He drew on the kid.
We'll let a jury
decide that. Now, move.
Come on, move!
Easy, wyatt!
All right,
marshal, I'll...
I'll take care
of it.
I'll take
his gun.
Miss elder?
Hello, alley.
Um, come on in.
No, thank you.
What can I do
for you, then?
Have you ever thought
of going to church?
Not lately. Why?
Well, we would like
to see you go to church
At least once,
miss elder.
To get married.
Alley,
When I want preaching,
I'll go to church.
But for the moment,
When I'm on my knees,
It ain't in prayer.
We've all got stakes
in tombstone.
We'll be here when all the
others have gone on through.
So it's up to us to work
together for a better town,
And a better future.
Thank you.
Good evening,
bartlett.
Hi, doc.
All this politicking's
gonna ruin my business.
Now, I guess I've got to
make something very clear.
And that is that I'm in tombstone to stay.
I think all of us here want to stay.
I think we all want the
town to have a future.
But it can't have a
future unless it prospers.
And it can't prosper with
gunplay in the streets.
Now, there's only one way
to get rid of the gun.
And that's
to use the gun.
The law's gotta
be enforced.
But I hope you'll let me
get the job done for us,
For all
our families.
That's all.
I hope you all
get home safe.
Wyatt: Thank you.
What did you think
of the speaking, mr. Clum?
Not bad,
For patent medicine.
You know, mr. Clum,
I'm not a politician.
I'm a peace officer.
I think I know what
doc's after, marshal.
What do you want?
I want to win,
mr. Clum.
Good night,
marshal.
Mr. Clum?
Yes?
What do you think
it is
The doc's after?
I'd say, uh,
Size,
Some, uh,
Wild and permanent
gesture of, uh,
Size.
Wyatt: You're taking too long, ike.
I need ringo
before the election.
Suppose I change
my mind?
You made a deal, ike.
That's right. I get 20,000, you
get ringo, you get to be sheriff,
And I get to be dead?
You want my ass
all the way, earp,
And I don't figure it's worth
You've gotta
deliver, ike.
I ain't gotta do shit.
I've got the kid
in jail.
He killed a man
this afternoon.
You're a liar!
Frank?
Where's the kid?
Huh?
I don't know.
You miserable
son of a bitch.
You deliver
ringo, ike.
Before
the election.
You'll get him.
It sure makes you
sleep good at night,
Knowing wyatt earp's
upholding the law, don't it?
Gotta put at least 1,000 on him, doc.
I think I can
cover that.
What do you want
to bail him out for?
Oh, just a sense of
civic responsibility.
I want him back in three
weeks for the trial.
Now, level
with me, kid.
Why'd you
kill him?
He drew on me.
He had a wife and two
kids. Did you know that?
No.
How old are you?
I'm 18.
What are you gonna do
with your life?
Don't you have
any ambition?
Yes, mr. Holliday.
What is it?
I want to be
like you.
Get the hell
out of here, kid.
Hello, bones.
Hello, bitch.
Did you have
a good day?
I had a visitor.
Who?
Mrs. Alley earp.
We had a talk
about, um,
The respectable people
of tombstone,
About how you and me are
living in a state of sin.
you should
have been here.
You know,
I sat around here
after she left,
Thinking about what
we're doing together,
Where we're going.
See, doc,
I never was ashamed
of what I was before.
My life then.
I liked it, doc.
I liked the money first.
But I liked
the life most.
I didn't want
to be some
Nester's wife stuck out
on the goddamn prairie.
Coming in at night smelling of
sheep, reading the bible, I...
What are you
driving at?
I wanted
the towns, doc.
I wanted lights,
Music,
Dancing.
On the line, I got 'em.
And I got a lot of other
things. A lot of 'em was bad.
But what was good...
After I met you,
I didn't want that life.
What do you want now?
I want to go away
With you.
Away from this place,
For however many years
you got left.
I want to have a child.
Nothing...
Nothing fancy, doc.
What...
what do you want?
I don't know.
Part of me wants
the same things,
And part of me wants
Something else.
What?
What "something else"?
What?
Doc,
I don't care for however
many years you've got left.
Take now.
Take me! Take
love
For as long
as you've got.
Doc, wait a...
Please don't.
Please don't go,
doc. Please. Doc!
What is it,
virgil?
Doc holliday bailed out the kid, wyatt.
Put up $1,000
cash money.
When?
Last night.
Well,
That ruins
the deal, virgil.
I know.
What we gonna
do, wyatt?
Kill the clantons.
Katie,
where's john?
He ain't home.
Tell him I want
to see him.
Why should I, wyatt?
Look, we better get
something straight, katie.
You don't own
john holliday.
You got no rights whatever
when it comes to him.
And I'll tell
you something,
Ever since you
hooked on to him,
He ain't
been himself.
Maybe he grew up.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe the tricks you learned
on the line got him so tired
That he can't
think straight.
All night?
You bailed out
the kid.
Yeah.
Caused
some trouble.
Trouble with
the clantons.
Trouble with
the clantons
Is your trouble,
Not mine.
You know, you've
changed, wyatt.
I don't understand
you anymore.
You don't
understand me?
I've changed.
I don't understand you.
You know,
there was a time
When my trouble
was your trouble,
And yours
was mine.
Times have changed.
It's different.
It's different, wyatt.
And I'll tell you why.
Because I got
to learn something.
I got to learn that I'm not
going to live forever.
And I got to learn
that I...
I'm sick and tired
of killing.
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of seeing young kids gun
down old men for bullshit reasons.
I don't want that
anymore, wyatt.
It doesn't make any sense
to me. I don't understand it.
And I wanna...
I wanna leave
something behind, wyatt.
I want to live.
whatever.
You're sure billy
clanton's in the oriental?
Positive.
All right.
All right.
I'd like you to go down
and talk to billy.
Real calm-like.
Tell him that the deal with ike is off.
Tell him I know that ike's
been talking about the deal,
So I'm gonna have
to teach him a lesson.
That I'm gonna bring
charges against ike
And the kid
For the stagecoach holdup.
And I'm gonna
charge ike
With trying to bribe
a territorial officer.
ike'll blow
his stack, brother.
I mean,
When billy tells him,
ike'll be coming after us.
That's right.
Where is doc?
I looked everywhere.
I tried every
saloon in town.
I can't find him.
You better
have a drink.
I don't want
a drink!
I want to find doc.
Now, please,
have you seen him?
You must
have seen him
Sometime today.
I haven't seen him
since this morning, katie.
Why'd he leave?
We had some words.
Well, everybody has words.
This was about
places we've been,
And places
we're going.
He never took anybody
anyplace before.
Maybe he never loved
Anyone before.
You should try
the chinaman.
The chinaman?
Wong: the palace of mirrors in shanghai.
I'd like you
to see that.
Manila.
manila.
Siam.
Siam.
Across
the seas,
Where spices grow.
Mmm.
Doc: Across the seas
where spices grow.
You son of a bitch.
Jesus christ! Get up, god damn it! Get up!
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute! Look at yourself.
Dirtier than a
quarter horse's butt!
Wait now. Just
wait a minute.
Wong and I are going to the
palace of mirrors. Get up!
Oh, well, go on, then,
god damn it, go!
Burn! Burn, you...
Man: Everybody out!
Man: It's too late!
Man: Buckets!
Get the buckets going!
Maybe we can go
away. California.
When?
Soon.
"soon"
ain't soon enough.
Kid, go on in there,
see what's going on.
We'll see you
at the corral.
Be careful.
Earp sees you,

"I swear
to uphold the law
"of the territory
of arizona
"and of the United States,
"so help me god. "
So help me god.
So help me god.
Mr. Holliday.
Hello, kid.
Sit down.
Mmm!
Would you, uh...
Would you like
a drink?
No, thanks,
mr. Holliday.
They're coming into town, mr. Holliday.
Who's coming
into town?
The clantons
and the mclowerys.
Why?
The marshal made a deal with ike.
Ike was supposed to turn
in ringo for the stage job.
Wyatt would give ike
the reward money,
And keep the glory
for himself.
And now the marshal says the deal's off.
He's gonna hold ike and
me for the stage job.
How many are
coming in?
Seven,
Counting me.
Why are you
telling me this?
'cause I don't want you
to die, mr. Holliday.
Into the camera.
They're here.
How many?
Seven.
How many?
Three earps.
And maybe
doc holliday.
Behan: Ike!
Ike!
Now, damn it, ike, I don't want
no shooting in the town limits.
Now, you all
give me your guns!
You're gonna have to take
'em away from us, johnny.
Ike, I don't want
no trouble.
You'd better tell that
to the goddamn marshal!
Can't do it,
wyatt.
The town's
my jurisdiction.
We'll settle it
in court, johnny.
You're not going to
solve anything with a gun.
Oh, you'd be surprised the
things you can solve with a gun.
Shotguns.
They got shotguns.
Spread out.
spread out!
Ike: Spread out!
Ike: Holliday, this ain't
none of your affair.
We're here
to talk to earp.
To talk!
God damn you...
Morgan's dead.
They killed
morgan.
Wyatt: They killed
my brother.
They came into this town,
They came in here,
looking for trouble.
They came in here to destroy everything
that we've been trying to build together.
But I'm telling you,
I swear to you,
That my brother's death
is not gonna be in vain.
'cause from this,
We're gonna build
a better town.
We're gonna build
a better tombstone.
I swear that to you.
That's all.
So long, doc.
Why the kid?
I guess he reminded me
of too many things.
