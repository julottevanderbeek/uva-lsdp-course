Listen to this! Listen to this,
you fellows! You fellows, listen!
General Grant chased the Rebs
out of Richmond four days ago.
And it's rumored that Lee's
already surrendered.
The war is over!
- Here's the captain's papers.
- Get those Yanks out of here.
All right, you two,
get this body out of here.
Pardee, get
these men out of sight.
Now, come on,
let's go.
Hurry it up, Mike.
Hurry it up.
- Captain Cagle?
- Yes.
- Brevet Major Harris.
- We've been expecting you.
Here's the warrant for the payroll.
Well, you brought a very small
guard for this much money.
- There's no Rebs within 50 miles.
- What about Randall's Raiders?
We drove them clear out of Louisiana
with their tails between their legs.
Well...
...all right. Hand it down.
Where's the station agent?
He got taken sick. One of
the boys took him back to camp.
Where you going?
- Back to the train.
- Go ahead.
Stand beside it with your mouth
shut and get on when it pulls out.
I'll be watching you
from this window.
Sign this receipt. Get that
money to your camp in a hurry.
Stop them, major!
They shot the station agent!
Get after them, you fools!
They stole your payroll.
- You all right?
- Yeah. Get out of here.
Fire at them, they're rebels!
Hey, lieutenant. Ain't that a federal
offense, breaking open them boxes?
Ain't that a beautiful sight?
Makes you feel like a kitten
with a whole basin of milk.
- What a pity it don't belong to us.
- How much you figure it comes to?
$ 12,250.
Lieutenant, how about making
that a neat, round sum?
Say $ 10,000, and us fellows
dividing up the difference?
You thieving rat.
The Army would shoot us.
Well, who would tell?
- I wouldn't, for one.
- Me neither.
Look at us. A bunch of starved
scarecrows, whipped and dead broke.
All we got from this war is
shriveled guts and saddle sores.
You got a tempting argument.
I doubt if it's legal.
It ain't legal, Vance, or moral.
Confederacy can use
that money more than us.
You're right. Tomorrow we're taking
this money to General Randall.
Well, we tried anyway.
Let's get into this grub.
- Regiments broke camp and moved out.
- But where to?
General said they'd
wait for us right here.
Been away eight days.
Might've been attacked.
Or ordered away all of a sudden.
We better ride into
Claysville and find out.
VANCE:
What's your regiment?
Fifth Louisiana Rifles,
or what's left of them.
Where's Randall's outfit?
The cavalry disbanded
two or three days ago.
Scattered so as
not to give up the horses.
You fellows should do likewise
before the Yanks confiscate them.
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about? What happened?
What's happened?
You mean you ain't heard?
General Lee surrendered
to Grant five days ago.
Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia.
- Surrendered? You're crazy.
- No, that's a fact, lieutenant.
All of us gave up our guns
in Shreveport last Monday.
So war's over.
We can all go home.
MAN:
If you've got one left to go to.
Now that the brigade's scattered,
how we gonna find the general?
- That's just it. We can't.
- We gotta try, Vance.
- Why?
- Why?
To give him
the money, of course.
I don't know.
The surrender changes everything.
We gotta talk it over.
We can't take this money.
It don't rightly belong to us.
Then tell us who it
does rightly belong to.
It belongs to the Confederate
government, I suppose.
There ain't no more Confederate
government. It's finished.
That's the truth.
They'll hang Jeff Davis and
throw all the others in prison.
Well, then it must still
be Federal property.
You mean we ought
to give it back to them?
A minnie ball in my leg's
got to be paid for.
Your brother nearly died
of gangrene in a Yankee prison.
We didn't steal this money.
We took it in battle, fair and square.
It's called "spoils of war,"
like capturing a horse.
We and the Federals
didn't know it was over.
So it's still prize money.
It's ours. You don't have to take
your share, if it sticks in your craw.
How do you feel about this, Ray?
What Vance says makes sense.
If we got a right to it,
we're fools not to take it.
It's settled.
I got it figured out.
We got $ 1750
apiece coming to us.
Wait until I get
to Georgia with this.
I'll buy a hog, a dog
and a rocking chair.
We all three just gonna
sit there and scratch.
We'll fix us up the best
farm in east Texas.
You bet. But first...
...I'm gonna get married.
Cathy's been waiting four years.
It seems more like 40 to me.
And now, instead of going back
to her empty-handed, I got this money.
Yanks!
Look at them. All brave and
sassy now that they licked us.
Not us, Mike.
Maybe the South is licked...
...but not us.
Still, it's smarter if we
split up here and now.
- So long, Mike.
- So long, Vance.
Whenever you get to Texas,
you know where to find me.
I ain't ever gonna leave
that rocking chair.
- Goodbye, Brett. Lots of luck.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Sarge.
You're new here.
What happened to McComb?
Joined the Army. I'm minding the store
until he's back. If he's still alive.
You think Ma would
like this bonnet?
That's pretty. See
if there's a fancy one...
...with lace and pink
ribbons for Cathy.
That's the only one I got left.
Anyhow, who feels free nowadays?
He does! He's going
home to get married.
If we clean him up so his
sweetheart recognizes him.
Don't worry. Cathy would
know me a mile away.
Wish I could take her a real nice
present like a gold ring or bracelet.
Sorry. That's all
the female finery I got left.
Except this here bustle, which
I've been using for a mousetrap.
- Give us that too.
- Hey, Vance...
...now, this is fit and proper
for a bridegroom.
- It's just your size.
- This feels like real broadcloth.
Sure is. Probably the last
good suit left in the state.
How much?
With the pants,
that will cost you $ 14.
I'll throw in a pair
of galluses free.
Hard money!
No Confederate shinplasters.
This look hard enough for you?
A $20 Federal bill. I ain't
seen one of these since '63.
- That cover what we owe you?
- Sure, I'll go wrap them up.
Jethro! Well, I'll be
dad-burned if it ain't old Jethro!
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Old rascal.
How'd you stay
alive all these years?
What's the matter?
We ain't changed that much.
You look kind of
surprised to see us.
- We all heard you was dead, Mr. Vance.
- Well, he done near was.
That minnie ball misspelled
my name a little.
You mean, our folks
don't even know I'm alive?
No, sir. Nobody does.
We'll ride by Cathy's
house and tell her.
She ain't there no more. Her folks was
killed in the same raid your pa was.
- Where is she?
- Your place. Moved in with your ma.
VANCE:
Strange how things work out.
We go off and fight four years. But
they come and kill him here at home.
BRETT: The place looks mighty rundown.
RAY: Plumb wore out, like us.
Come on, let's go in
yelling like we used to.
Ma?
My son!
They told me you were dead.
They were almost right.
But here's what's left of me, Ma.
Just think. All three of you.
Brett!
Ray.
All my sons. Home again.
Clint!
Clint!
Clint!
Clint, come running!
Cathy! Cathy!
Vance.
Cathy.
Let me have a good
look at you, honey.
Yeah, that's just how I've seen you
night and day for four years...
...except for those britches.
Clint! Clint!
Vance!
Oh, no!
This can't be the sprat!
Look at how he's grown and filled out.
- He's almost a man, ain't he, Cathy?
- They told us you were dead.
Yeah, I know. I know. Now, come on.
Come on. Tell me about you all.
We got a heap
of work to do.
First thing, get Cathy out
of those britches and into a dress.
I try, but she works harder than
a mule all day helping me and Ma.
Not anymore.
We got three farm hands.
Come on, I got
a bushel of things to tell you.
Vance? I don't reckon you
could have known about this...
...but me and Cathy got married
about three months ago.
Married?
Well, this is a...
This is a day of surprises all around.
I don't know what we'd
have done without Cathy.
Or her without us after
her folks died.
We had poor scratching
to keep body and soul together...
...waiting for the war to end.
Well, it must've been hard.
Well...
...congratulations, Clint.
We always did want Cathy
in the family, didn't we, Ma?
Yes, son.
Always.
Hey, Cathy.
Look at the nicks
on this saber.
How many Yankees
did you all get?
- We didn't stop to count.
- Whole bunch?
Most of those nicks
came from butchering pigs.
I'll bet. A blue one
with the brass buttons.
Wish I would've been there.
I bet you I would've gotten my share.
He ranted and raved whenever
we got news of a battle.
You did right to stay here,
Clint. You did fine.
I love my bonnet. You boys shouldn't
have spent what little you got on me.
That's a mighty poor gift,
Ma, for all you've given us.
CLINT:
Hey! Look here.
A brand new Sunday-go-to-meeting suit.
That's a present for you.
From all of us.
For me? It must've cost a fortune.
- Where'd you get money?
- We had some saved up.
- We still got a few dollars left.
- That's more than we got.
Sit down while everything's hot.
Come on, Clint.
You're hungry, aren't you?
Dear Lord, I thank you most kindly for
bringing my boys home safe and sound.
It's sure good
to hear him sing.
It sure is. All we're
missing now is Pa.
Remember we all used
to sit here and sing?
Indeed. Brings back
a heap of good memories.
Vance used to sing the loudest.
This one was his favorite.
If we wanna get to work before
sunup, we better turn in.
A lot of things around
here need fixing.
What's troubling you, Vance?
You ain't your old self tonight.
Oh, I'm all right.
A little tired, I reckon.
Vance...
...I know you and Cathy used to be
kind of fond of each other, but...
You ain't got no hard feelings
against either of us, have you?
Hard feelings? Me?
Why, of course not.
You really mean that?
Down deep?
- Listen, did I ever lie to you?
- No.
All right. Oh, I liked Cathy,
sure. But we all did.
But I was never
in love with her.
We were just real good friends.
And that's how it still is.
So don't you ever
think nothing else.
Why...
...I'm just happy for both of you.
I hoped it'd be that way, Vance.
We're so much in love.
I could never tell you.
You don't have to.
It's written all over your
face. And hers too.
You go on to bed.
I'm gonna lock the barn.
There's a lot of stragglers.
They might steal our horses.
You can't even trust a Reb nowadays.
I'll see you in the morning.
Vance, you've gotta
let me talk to you.
You never said
one word to me tonight.
- Please let me explain.
- Nothing to explain.
Oh, but there is.
Please let me...
Give me a chance to tell you...
Coming to bed, Vance?
Vance?
How soon you figure we can tell folks
about the money?
A couple months. We'll spend a little
at a time so as not to start talk.
You're the boss, Vance.
We gotta buy seed if we hope
to get a good crop this summer.
The crop'll have to wait.
The money we got hidden in here
is a lot better than seed.
Vance.
Your mare worked her shoe loose.
It's all right now.
Please, I've been trying to see you
alone for over a week now.
Won't you even try and understand?
No one asks why a woman
gets married.
You do. You ask me with every look.
You've no right to think
I was faithless.
I waited for you,
just like I promised.
I thought about you all day long,
and prayed for you every night.
Then that letter came
saying you were dead.
I didn't want to live myself anymore.
I loved you, Vance.
With all my heart and soul.
You know I did.
How can you doubt it?
That's what hurts the most, Cathy.
I know. And I can't forget it.
We got to, both of us,
or we can't live under the same roof.
I know that too.
Maybe time will take care of it.
I want you to be happy.
I never will be unless you are, Vance.
I hear you lying awake at night.
I know what you're thinking about.
Me and Clint, side by side.
Why'd you tell him there was
never anything between us?
- You want me to tell him the truth?
- He already knows it. I told him.
Why?
Because I don't like
living with a lie.
He believed you when you said
you never loved me.
He'll believe you because he loves you
just as much as he loves me.
So if he's big enough to forget
what's past, then you can too.
Please, Vance.
Please try for my sake.
Cathy?
What you doing?
- Something wrong?
- No, Clint. Nothing. I was...
Cathy, you're crying.
What are you crying about?
I don't know, Clint.
I had a bad dream, I guess.
The war and everything.
Don't cry. We're all safe again.
There's nothing to worry about.
I hope not.
But to have to lose you again so soon.
I knew this was gonna happen, son.
I could see the heartbreak
growing in you.
I reckon what you're doing is right.
There's no other way, Ma.
I tried to hide it,
but I can't stay on.
Sooner or later Clint would see.
- He might guess now anyway.
- No, he won't.
I'll tell him I'm going out
to California for a few months.
He'll believe it.
And the rest of you'll never tell him.
When you planning to go?
Tomorrow.
No, Ma. The quicker the better.
Tomorrow we'll go to the raising
of the new schoolhouse.
I'll tell Clint and Cathy there,
and leave before they can stop me.
They'll both be mighty upset, Vance.
Maybe so, but they won't make a scene
in front of all of our friends.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Clint thinks the sun rises
and sets in you.
I know, Ma.
That's just why I'm going.
What's wrong?
My, you girls look pretty.
I have to keep an eye on you.
Go on, Clint.
Ray, tell the fellas to hurry it up.
We don't want to miss any of the fun.
Ninety, ninety-five, two.
How come you're only taking 200?
You all need it more than I do.
Give Ma the rest of my share.
Tell her how we got it
and that it's rightfully ours.
- It isn't fair, giving up everything.
- Come on, take more than $200.
You gotta have a stake out West.
I'll get a job somewhere.
Don't worry.
Now, come on. Act natural.
I don't want Clint and Cathy
to suspect anything.
CLINT:
Come on, fellas!
What kept you so long?
Greasing your hair
for them girls at the picnic?
Hey, you missed!
One more!
Missed again!
Right this way, folks!
Give some money
to build our school!
Right this way!
MAN:
Pull out those hundred dollar bills!
We want the money to build
that schoolhouse over there!
There's one of the best roofers
in the county!
We want the money
to build that schoolhouse!
GIRL 1: Sing another one!
GIRL 2: Yeah, one more!
She's not a day over 20 years old.
She'll last.
What do you mean, going away?
Where?
An old army friend
has a ranch out in California.
He needs a partner.
I've been getting restless anyway...
That's not your reason, Vance.
You're leaving because
of me and Clint.
Maybe so.
I can't meet his eyes
after what you told me.
We don't want you to go.
This is your home. We love you.
A home can be full of too much love.
Then one night it burns up,
and everybody in it.
I can't face the others,
knowing you left because of me...
...and they knowing it too.
I guess you'll have to learn.
You can't go. You know how I feel.
- Don't say it.
- You know that...
Even if it's true, don't say it.
Not now.
Not ever.
Cathy? What's the matter?
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- I told her I was going away.
And I was coming to tell you.
- Away? What do you mean?
- Vance! Ray! Brett!
These fellows want to talk to you.
Vance? That's Major Kincaid,
and this gentleman's Mr. Siringo.
Howdy. Won't you light and join us?
- No, thanks. This won't take long.
- We hope.
I've been engaged to recover property
lost or stolen during the war.
Well, that's good news.
We lost a lot of things around here.
Want our list?
No, we've got our own.
Three of you brothers were
members of Randall's cavalry...
...a unit of which attacked
a railroad station...
...on the morning of April 10, 1865.
Eight weeks ago.
By impersonating soldiers,
you took an Army payroll...
...amounting to $ 12,250 from
an officer who was on the train.
Those may have been your orders...
...but the war was already over...
...and had been since noon
of the preceding day.
- Any idea what he's talking about?
- No.
He's got us mixed up.
We found one of the men
who got away with you...
...and we recovered his share
of the money.
- He told us who stole the rest.
- He's lying.
Don't be foolish. I've known you
since you was knee-high.
I'd hate to see you get into trouble.
If you got the money, give it back.
We didn't steal any money, Ed.
Well, that's possible,
but we mean to make sure.
The paymaster can identify the men
who took the money.
We're taking you to him.
Someone wants to see us,
you bring him here.
We're not leaving.
We hoped you'd make no trouble,
but you're all three under arrest.
We're taking you into Tyler.
Get your horses.
You got no right to do this!
They never lied or stole from nobody.
Stay out of this, Clint.
Go on. Get the horses.
Vance.
Now, don't worry, Ma.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Don't you worry.
Don't worry, Martha.
I'll go with them.
If that man recognizes you,
we're done for.
How can he?
We were bearded then.
He can't tell us now from Adam.
What happened, Mr. Vance?
You boys in some trouble?
Nothing serious, Jethro.
Just a little misunderstanding.
We'll get it cleared up right shortly.
- It's a frame-up.
- There must be something behind it.
- Sure there is.
- Go on, get me some hot water.
They want revenge on Randall's men
for driving them crazy during the war.
Start making up charges,
like stealing money or something.
- What'll they do with Vance?
- They'll put him in a stinking prison.
What's the matter, Clint?
Well, why did you say just Vance?
We're worried about all three of them.
Well, of course we are.
That's what I meant.
What was that?
Somebody just rode up.
Clint? No, put that gun down!
You stay in here.
CLINT:
Who are you? What do you want?
- Is your name Reno?
- Yeah. What about it?
We're friends of your brothers.
Is there any of them around?
Vance, Brett or Ray?
No, why?
We come to warn him.
Some men are looking for him.
Too late. They arrested them
this morning on some lying charge.
It was a lie, wasn't it?
- Sure.
- Where'd they take them?
To town. They're taking a train
to Tyler to stand trial.
- Let's get going.
- I'll go with you!
Clint! Clint!
We've got to stop him.
Who are you, men? How do we know
you're friends of Vance?
Don't worry, miss.
We know you well enough.
You're Cathy.
Vance must've showed us your picture
a thousand times.
Ain't it natural that his brother
wants to help get him free?
Good night, miss.
I understand how you might feel
about this money.
Even if they don't identify you,
they can send you to prison.
The three of you.
I don't want to send you to prison.
All I want is to recover the money.
I'll make you a fair proposition.
Tell me you'll give me the money.
I give you my word we'll drop
the charges. Forget the whole thing.
This is your last chance.
If they identify you tomorrow,
you'll get 10 years.
Even if they let you go,
you'll be watched your whole life.
The money'd do you no good.
I know you've got it.
Here's the $20 bill
you spent at that crossroad store.
You know, it's funny.
If the war had gone the other way...
...you might have been questioning
him instead of me.
What do you say?
We haven't got all of it.
Only our shares.
Where's the rest?
I don't know.
That's no good. We want it all.
I'm willing to do what you say, but we
can't give you more than we've got.
Then we've got no deal.
Sit still. Don't move.
Sit down, or you'll get shot.
Get his gun, Ray.
Get his gun and keys
and unlock those cuffs.
Stop the train at that water tower!
Go on, grab the brakes!
Get out, quick!
Sit down!
Keep your seats
and nobody'll get hurt.
- Listen, Mike...
- Get out, Vance. Sit down!
Pardee!
Get out!
- Clint, what are you doing here?
- Did you think I'd let you down?
Get mounted and get out of here!
They got away!
We've got to get back to Bedford.
Conductor, telegraph descriptions of
the men to the surrounding counties.
- Shoot on sight. They're armed.
- Yes, sir.
Engineer, back this train
into Bedford, fast.
The Reno boys didn't plan the getaway.
They were as surprised as we were.
Believe what you like. They knew.
They had it timed to the split second.
Don't you agree?
It looks that way, but I'm not sure
I can agree with you.
If the escape was planned,
why'd Vance confess?
- That's what I mean. He was...
- Are you defending this man?
You had your chance and you failed.
Now, I'm gonna get him my way.
And the money.
- All right, Clint. Get on back home.
- Why?
Go on before somebody sees you.
- A lot of thanks for helping you.
- I didn't want your help. None of you.
- You was being took to prison!
- I could've made a deal with Siringo.
We'll be halfway to the Mississippi
by morning.
- Head down river, he can't catch us.
- Hold on, hold on.
We're gonna get off the road
and settle this now.
Ed, Pardee, Mike.
I led you through four years of war,
and I never steered you wrong, did I?
So you ought to know that nobody
hates giving up more than I do.
But these men will hound us
until we're dead or behind bars.
So you did take the payroll.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
We felt we had
a right to it, Clint.
We did have a right to it.
You told us that yourself.
What changed your mind?
Siringo and common sense.
He said he'd forget everything
if we return the money.
I bet he'll still do it, in spite of
that holdup. Nobody was hurt.
I vote we give it back.
The money isn't worth that risk.
I agree. We've been shot at
enough for one lifetime.
What about you?
You two boys can do as you please.
I'm keeping my share.
- Me too.
- And me.
You'll never get away with it.
They'll scour the country.
- They'll shoot on sight.
- We'll take our chances.
Don't be stupid.
There's nothing in this but trouble.
Your trouble is, you lost your guts.
Come on, boys.
Hold it.
This deal is only good
if we turn in all the money.
So if I gotta save your necks too,
that's the way it is.
Get it. And their guns.
Now I'm going back to get our shares.
I'll meet you right after daybreak
at Hanna's mill.
Brett, that means you and Ray too.
How do we know you aren't lying?
Maybe this here Siringo
didn't make you any deal at all.
Yeah, and even if he did,
how good is his word?
I trust it.
Clint.
Nobody knows you're in on this.
Go into town and tell Siringo
I'll bring the money tomorrow morning.
You come to the mill
and give us his answer.
That satisfy you?
What choice have we got?
Go on, Clint. Get going.
And we thought he was our friend.
He is, Mike. Best one you ever had.
We found nothing so far.
If the money's here,
they must have buried it.
Martha, if you know where
it is or where the boys are...
...you better tell us.
But I don't know.
They had no money.
We haven't seen them since
you took them off yesterday.
It's the truth. Can't you believe us?
We don't know more than what you said.
- Where's Clint?
- He went into town.
Sorry to have to do this.
We're leaving three men
here, day and night.
What for?
Just in case your sons
come back for any reason.
Martha.
Jethro.
Mr. Vance.
- Where did you come from?
- Don't ask questions. Just listen.
We're in trouble.
It may work out if you'll help us.
Well, you know I will.
These men will shoot them.
I can't stay here and do nothing.
How can we warn them?
Where are they?
I'm riding into town.
Someone there can help.
- Maybe they won't let you go.
- I can try.
Jethro! What are you doing here?
Where did you get that?
Mr. Vance sent me
for it, Miss Cathy.
- Where is he?
- Up in my cabin.
- Give it to me.
- I should bring...
There's a soldier outside, and
if they catch you... Get down!
- Need any help, ma'am?
- No, thank you.
Let me throw the saddle on.
It's too heavy.
I can manage.
I do it myself every day.
Which one of these
Reno brothers is your man?
- None of your business!
- I'm just trying to be friendly.
The war's over,
or ain't you heard?
Don't seem like it. Ransacking
our house, tearing our barn apart.
Why not leave
decent folks alone?
Decent folks don't go stealing
money or holding up trains!
We got orders. Nobody's to leave
here without being searched.
Well, go ahead. Search me.
Well, if anybody asks,
you tell them I searched.
I don't want to get in no trouble.
Cathy!
- What are you doing?
- I brought the money. The others?
They're waiting. We'll give
it back, then they'll let us go free.
They don't know that.
They got orders to shoot you on sight.
I must get to Siringo first.
Clint rode to say I was coming.
So give me the money and we'll...
Wait! Don't move.
You all right?
If we get across the swamp, there's
a place you can hide. Willing to try?
They didn't see us.
Come on.
And after you've given the money
back, will you still go away?
Yeah.
It won't help, Vance.
We won't ever forget each other.
You and I know that, Cathy.
But nobody else
must ever know.
BRETT:
What did Siringo have to say?
He said to bring the money
before dark and he'd drop charges.
- What about us?
- All of you.
You take a chance riding in
because Kincaid don't trust you.
And he can't get word to him.
Vance should be here now.
That's what we figured.
I ran into Jethro. He said Vance
came to his place after daylight.
Kincaid's men were watching.
Jethro fetched the money...
...and Cathy took it and went
to meet Vance.
- Is that the girl in the farm?
- That's right. She's my wife.
- Your wife?
- She was Vance's girl.
Go ahead, Clint.
What else did old Jethro say?
Soldiers jumped him.
He made a run for it.
- Didn't Cathy come back home?
- No.
GAVIN: Probably rode a long
way by this time.
In any direction.
- What do you mean?
- He's got the money, ain't he?
Are you saying that Vance
would double-cross us?
Not only us. Didn't you know
he was crazy about your wife?
BRETT:
You're wrong, Mike.
- He liked Cathy once, that ended...
- What are you lying to him for?
He carried her picture
through the war.
FLEMING:
He was gonna marry her.
GAVIN: It's time you opened
your eyes. He wanted her.
- Now he's run away with her.
KELSO: And with our money.
They probably had
it all figured out.
Clint! Wait a minute!
Come on, Ray. We've got
to find them before he does.
They could all be in on this.
Come on.
Nobody knows about this place except
Brett and Ray.
We used it on hunting trips.
You'll be safe here.
I'm worried about you. You got no way
of knowing what Siringo told Clint.
If it's no, they'll kill you.
It's a chance I gotta take.
Clint will be waiting at the mill.
- What if he isn't?
- Go to town, give him back the money.
So you stay here and I'll send
someone for you by nightfall.
Vance?
What makes you sure
they're headed west?
You ain't in cahoots on this,
by any chance?
Then you lose us and join them.
That could be the plan.
You think I'd send my
wife out to get shot?
Maybe not. If her and Vance is
put on, you've got us to settle with.
Ain't nothing put on with them.
They put one over on us.
Shut up. I don't
wanna hear no more.
- Then find them. And fast.
- Don't worry, I've got more reason.
If he finds them, he won't
listen. He's half crazy.
Vance wouldn't run out on us.
He's probably hiding out until...
Hey, hold on. I know where
he might be. Let them ride on.
I was right.
That's Cathy's mare.
Then he went to the mill,
taking the money with him.
When he doesn't find you,
he'll go into town alone.
We figured that's how it was.
Something's come up
you gotta know about.
- Clint thinks you run off with Vance.
- I did...
No, I don't mean like that.
He thinks you left him for good.
That's not true.
Whoever put that idea in his head?
Gavin's bunch. They think
Vance took the money and you.
I tried to reason with him.
He wouldn't listen. He's jealous.
If he finds Vance,
there's no telling what he'll do.
- Let me talk to him. Where is he?
- Come on, we'll find him.
What proof do you want?
Your brothers cut loose to join them.
They was all in this together.
This one's leading us on.
You'll see if I am.
All I want is to find them if it
takes the rest of my life.
Clint...
- Where is he?
- Better listen careful to her, Clint.
You believe what they told you?
I reckon I've always known.
This just plain showed me.
- Let me tell you. Listen...
- Quit lying to me!
I believed your lies
like you wanted.
Like the night you stood
at our window crying.
When you ran from me
because of what Vance said.
No, listen, and let me...
- Give her the chance!
- For what, to deny it? She can't!
Go on, say I'm lying!
Say he weren't your lover!
Say you ain't laid
awake thinking of him!
Wishing I was Vance!
Wishing you'd never married me!
Shut up! None of it's so.
Tell me he hasn't held
you or kissed you.
- You're hurting me!
- You can't say it because it's true.
- You're lying! You love him!
- No! Stop it!
- You're lying! You love him!
- Stop!
- I know you do! I ought to kill you.
- You're crazier than a mad duck!
You would've killed her!
You know what you meant to each other
as well as I do!
You're just trying to protect her.
Hold it, Ray.
Come on.
You're going home.
Go back where we found you.
Wait for Vance in case he returns.
Warn him. Tell him to stay there.
Now, get out of here.
Go on.
I sent her home. Now, you're going
into town with us. Get mounted.
Hold it, Brett.
They're lying about her going home.
She's heading back to him.
We gotta follow her.
That's a lie!
Vance is on his way to find us.
With the money to meet Siringo.
You think we're
gonna swallow that?
Pardee, get their guns.
Give Clint back his gun.
You can do what you want.
We're trailing her.
You're right.
They're still trying to throw us off.
Now, you two can go back
to the mill or to Hades...
...but don't follow us.
Let's go, boys.
We gotta find Vance, but where?
If he's not at the mill, we'll try
to catch him before he gets to town.
GAVIN: What'd I tell you?
She led us straight to him.
- Where is he?
- Don't know. Brett told you the truth.
- You're protecting him!
- Leave her alone. That ain't helping.
He wouldn't have left her
unless he was coming back.
So we'll just sit here
until he walks in.
VANCE:
Ray! Brett!
So now they're gunning
for you. Clint with them.
They think you
double-crossed them.
Maybe we can knock some sense into
their heads before anybody gets hurt.
First we gotta get rid of this.
Ray, ride into town. Give it
to Siringo, tell him what's happened.
Where are you going?
We'll get to the cave and wait.
You bring what help you can.
Now, get going.
Vance? He'll never give you
the chance to explain now.
We tried. So did Cathy.
Clint came near to killing her for it.
He'll listen to me.
I'm warning you.
He's more dangerous than any of them.
That's him. With Brett.
Get out of sight. Watch her.
Wait until they get up close.
- They got here ahead of us.
- They're up there with her.
They must've seen us coming.
You stay here.
This is my job.
Any one of them
is liable to shoot you.
Not Clint. He couldn't.
And he'd stop the man who tried.
You haven't seen his face.
Clint!
Can you hear me, Clint?
I know what you're thinking, Clint!
But you got it all wrong! Dead wrong!
All Cathy did was
to bring me the money!
There's nothing else between us!
I swear it! Nothing at all!
Well, I know different, don't I?
I was going away, Clint!
And I'm still going, for good!
I had to square things
with Siringo first. I've done it!
He couldn't have. He ain't had
time to get to town and back.
It's a scheme.
He's trying to draw us out.
Listen to me, Clint! Ray's going
in to take Siringo the money!
That'll give us clean hands,
all of us!
Unless one of you loses his
head now and adds killing to it!
He's lying to you about the money.
He's still got it on him.
He only came back for her.
And she knows it.
Why don't you answer me, Clint?
What's stopping you?
Can't you see he's just stalling?
Working closer until he can jump us?
Probably got Ray and Brett
working behind us.
VANCE:
What's troubling you?
Well, go on.
You asked for him. Take him.
I got no reason to lie to you. I only
came to tell you our trouble's over.
We can go home with nothing to fear!
Go home.
Go home to what?
Well, go on. Take him.
Now! Or I'll take him myself.
Vance!
Come on! Let's get
the money and get out of here!
Get away from him!
Leave him alone!
Clint, look out!
Hey, don't move.
Just lie still.
Cathy, where's Vance?
I got to talk to him.
- Right here, Clint.
- Vance, I didn't mean it.
I know you didn't.
You don't have to tell me.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
