Get up!
You shouldn't go looking for fights.
I have to do it.
You're talking to a bounty killer.
I reckon you know what
the star stands for.
It means I don't need
bounty killers around here.
And the reward?
I'll take it. It goes to a worthy cause.
It goes into your pocket,
Sheriff, right?
I'm glad you understand.
Jim!
Jim! Jim!
Your brother just got another
one of the bandits, alive!
He's looking for you!
Give Margie a kiss for
me and get on home!
Two bandits this month, nine
in a year. This is the tenth one.
There'll be a celebration.
They didn't have one last time.
Bill Slattery was killed.
This time the whole
town's gonna go wild!
I gotta get going.
There's gonna be
a celebration, Margie.
- See you tonight, Margie.
- Jim!
I'm sorry, Dick, but I have to leave.
- You can make my excuses.
- What'll I say?
I don't know.
Dick...
...keep an eye on Jim.
My brother's still just a kid.
Don't worry, Bert.
- You know, you're pretty good.
- What are you doing here?
It ain't nice to leave town without
saying good-bye to a fellow.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with you.
I ain't going to White Rock.
Why aren't you going to White Rock?
Jim, when I was seven years old,
our father was murdered...
...and the fellow who did it
will be brought to justice.
I'm gonna see to that. It's an
old score and I want to pay it...
...once and for all.
Okay. Where exactly
will we be heading?
No, I'm going alone.
He was my Dad too.
It's too much of a risk.
You're too young.
You were younger than I am, when
you first caught Sam Guildmore.
Sure you wanna come?
You bet.
- Where will we be heading?
- Mexico.
Mexico?
On the other side is Sierra Mojada.
I want pesos.
Two hundred dollars worth.
Dollars? One moment, sir.
Please, one moment.
Did you say dollars?
The bank is always
glad to get dollars.
Yes, the bank is always glad.
It comes to 2,400 pesos, sir.
Thank you very much.
Do you know anyone called...
...Cisco Delgado?
Do you know Cisco Delgado?
Yes, I know the name.
But I've never met senor Delgado.
He's never been to Sierra Mojada.
Now, if the bank can be
of any further use to you?
Halt!
Forward!
Like the entertainment?
Why did you kill them?
It's the way I punish thieves.
You murdered them for stealing?
I may have had other reasons.
That's the way I do things, stranger.
Ask if he knows Cisco Delgado.
He doesn't know him.
Nobody knows him.
Take it easy.
It's powerful stuff.
What is it?
Firewater.
Tell me, miss, do you know
a certain Cisco Delgado?
You didn't answer me.
I don't know him.
Wait a minute.
If you don't remember...
...maybe this will jog your memory!
You didn't have to do that.
He's just a kid.
You're just a kid, too.
Next time, mind your own business.
You staying or leaving?
My boss thinks he can help you.
- Who's this boss of yours?
- Mr. McCloud.
It's a wonderful way
to induce perspiration.
I'm sorry, won't you two
please sit down?
We don't have much time for visiting.
That's really too bad.
I know that you are Texans.
I don't want you to have
to return empty handed.
They tell me you're
searching for someone.
I think I recall the name
that they mentioned.
Shall we talk?
Yes, that's better.
If I asked you why you
were looking for him...
...you'd probably say it
was none of my business...
...wouldn't you?
True.
It's Creme de Mente...
...not Firewater.
I prefer to drink mint before lunch.
Is that right?
And if I kept asking you exactly
why you wanted to see this man...
...you wouldn't tell?
Exactly.
Then I can't help you, despite
the fact that I'd really like to.
What do you mean?
Why do you want to see Delgado?
Just a minute...
...two gold nuggets.
They have the magic power
of granting speech to the mute.
Tell me why you're here.
Then I'll give you a little advice.
Take your brother and
go back to Texas.
Stranger, I'm afraid some dirty
vermin just stole your horses.
Breaks my heart.
Mine, too.
Texas is back there!
Is that some kind of a hint?
No, it's an order.
According to the laws of this territory,
the mayor has the power not to...
...admit or expel any or all strangers
considered undesirable to the state.
The mayor is right here.
That fellow is the lawyer and
you two are the undesirable.
What do you mean?
We haven't done anything.
What is your name, boy?
Jim Sullivan, and this
is my brother, Bert.
Bert, you'd better tell your brother,
and tell him right away...
...what happens when a
stranger gets too curious.
Wait. I need to talk to you.
No one will see us down here.
Suits me.
I'm sorry about what just happened.
In this part of Mexico,
there's no law, there's no order...
...only anarchy and the total
oppression of mercenary interests...
...of merciless tyranny and
uncontrolled power.
So I've found out.
Exactly. You've seen it.
And all because we're afraid
of one all-powerful man.
Who is he?
They could be following us.
Tell me where I can find him.
I don't know anything about that.
Wait, don't go.
Stay here and help us.
We're planning to
rebel against Delgado.
You two are Americans,
you are both free!
You've been through this already.
You understand.
Will you give us help?
I'd like to, I really would...
...but I'm in too much of a hurry
to wait for a revolution.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Thanks, Mr. Sullivan.
You drink too much, Miguel.
It's time too stop.
Don't tell me what to do.
About them two foreigners...
...if you want me to, I could
arrange a little accident.
That's something I'll do.
Adios, Miguel.
Are you tired?
Bert, when you were sheriff, didn't
you try to catch your criminals alive?
This ain't White Rock
If you're afraid, you'd better
turn around and go home.
Here comes a carriage.
Let's get a ride.
He's trying to run us down!
That's the first time you
ever killed any one, ain't it?
Yeah.
You'll get used to it.
Please, come with me.
This dollar belongs to you.
Are you still interested
in knowing about Delgado?
Yes, of course.
The horse is all yours.
Didn't make it? Next time, maybe.
You keep an eye on the horses,
let me take care of the girls.
If I tell you where Delgado is,
it will cost you six dollars...
...plus four for my trouble,
that makes it ten.
The girl is included in that for free.
In the mountains, there's a little hut
near the trail that leads to Traherra...
...where we'll find a shepherd named
Manuel Hernandez. He'll talk.
I hope so.
I can't understand it, Cisco.
Old Antonio there, refuses
to sell us his land.
Bad Antonio.
I want that land.
And I want it right away.
- Good morning, Cisco.
- Good morning.
What have you got, McCloud?
It's the collection for the month,
with the cash for those twenty girls...
...and the thirty crates of rifles.
The alcohol's on another bill.
Keep talking.
The land near Coberta wasn't
producing so I sold it.
The settlers of Tahona refused to
pay. I had to punish them for that.
I'll take care of the
punishing around here.
Do you want your sons to die?
It will be on your head.
Cisco!
A couple of strangers were in Sierra
Mojada yesterday, looking for you.
Did you find out who they were?
They're the sons of Jack Sullivan.
I tried to send them back where they
came from, but they wouldn't go.
But don't worry about it.
I can handle it.
Leave them alone!
Where are they now?
The path near Traherra.
Bert! There's someone down here.
Yeah, there's someone.
Whoever it is, is dead.
It's the girl from the tavern.
I knew we'd see each
other again, Yankee.
God did not listen to me...
...even though I prayed.
Now, I want you boys to bury the girl.
Make the grave big enough
for you and your brother.
You might need it.
While I'm at it, I'll make it
big enough for all of you.
That seem strange to you?
What?
Why didn't they try to kill us?
They had plenty of chances.
I don't know.
What do you want?
Are you Manuel Hernandez?
Arkita told us the way here.
Where is Cisco Delgado?
Wait.
It's not enough. Another.
It's enough.
All right. Come on.
Those are Delgado's prisoners.
Go with them but don't ask any
questions. Good-bye.
Juan, Juan, It's us!
Bring her out! Come on you!
No! Let go of me! Let go of me!
Take your hands off me!
Let go of me!
You dirty killers! You're just a bunch
of filthy murderers! Every one of you!
Stay where you are! Make one false
move, God help me, I'll shoot you!
Now get out of that wagon!
You're free! Go, you're free!
Get down! All of you!
You're acting like a fool!
Bert! What are you
gonna do about it, Bert?
We've got other work to do, boy.
Put them in with the others!
And give them a bath!
And you two come with me!
Where's Delgado?
Didn't they tell you not to
ask any more questions?
Yeah.
Then you'd better take their advice.
He's gonna wait here.
I've been expecting you,
Bert Sullivan.
You know why I'm here, don't you?
It's taken you a pretty
long time to get here.
You're going back to Texas.
You've got a score to settle with
the law and I'll see it gets paid.
I've come a long way since I left
Texas. Land, money, this house...
...a name that's feared
all over Mexico.
Do you expect me to
leave all of this behind...
...because you are blind enough to
confuse revenge with justice?
You killed my father.
That's not a good enough reason
for me to give myself up to you.
I'm taking you back
with me, Cisco.
No! You're going back alone!
I'll give you a chance to
get out. You better take it.
Where's Jim?
Why do you want to know?
Jim is my son.
You were a kid when I was there.
I wish it had never happened.
I couldn't forget her.
Not even after she died.
I didn't come back for Jim...
...because I knew he was with you...
...and would grow up to be honest...
...respected, without the taint
of being a criminal's son.
It wasn't an easy thing to do.
It was a sacrifice.
All the same, I did it
and I'm not sorry!
I did it for his sake...
...and now you've bought him here
to show him what his father's like.
I never wanted him to find out
what his father really was.
I hope you're satisfied.
Well?
Follow me.
She's pretty.
Dance. It's your party. Go ahead.
The party's for you, too.
Why don't you think better
than any of my men.
I'd pay a lot to a man like you.
There's a job here if you want it.
We're going back tomorrow.
Really?
I'll give you money.
Enough money to last you
for the rest of your life.
You can do that in Texas.
You're coming back.
That's where you're wrong.
Dead wrong!
Just who the hell do you
think you are?
My judge? Well, you aren't
and I'm not gonna take it!
Your father was nothing
but a cheap bandit...
...and your mother a harlot!
I said, this girl here is mine.
Don't move!
That's all! Go on, get out!
It was because of the girl.
He's the one who started it.
Sure, Jim. Sure.
Leave us alone.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
Take your hands off me,
you murderer!
Lock him up!
You had your chance
and you didn't take it.
I'm turning him over to you.
Show him that I mean business.
Give Miguel what's left of him. I want
him taken to the Texas boundary.
Good-bye, Bert.
Greetings from Cisco, Miguel.
He wants you to take the
American back to Texas again.
What did I tell you?
You are undesirable.
You wait for me outside.
You push this one on the floor and...
...I'm gonna break your arm.
Why is he treating me like this?
That's something I wouldn't
mind finding out myself.
Calm down.
You get out of my way.
Open it.
And look inside it.
It's your mother's.
We knew each other.
Don't look at me like that.
How did you know my mother?
Answer me!
How did you know my mother?
You are my son.
Take it!
What's the matter?
You don't want to talk?
I understand.
There is one thing, pray!
I wouldn't feel so bad
about leaving this country.
- Hello, Sullivan.
- Howdy!
What's this?
A bunch of lousy revolutionaries?
And a pretty poor bunch at that.
Your men can't shoot straight
enough to knock off my hat.
Are there enough men?
For what?
To eliminate Cisco Delgado.
Idiots! Stupid idiots!
You can't stop Cisco!
Are you tired of living?
Yes. Under these conditions,
who wouldn't be tired of living?
Do me a favor, stranger.
Pray for all of us.
Don't go away. You once
stood for justice and liberty.
My father told me that you
lost your wife and your sons...
...because you stood up to Delgado
Why don't you join us?
No. It's too late now.
What about you, Sullivan?
Will you help us?
I wish you luck.
Your gun.
Your gun.
What do you want it for?
You heard what Fernandez said.
I heard that Cisco has
your brother in prison.
I'm sorry.
You're very brave to try and fight.
I admire Fernandez. He's a man you
can trust. He has the courage to die.
He knows what dignity is.
Good-bye, stranger.
Jim! Jim! Hurry! Come on!
There's no one on guard! Come!
Come on!
Come on!
Hold it!
No, you don't!
You shouldn't have tried that.
Come back here.
Come back here!
I'm warning you.
Get ready for an attack!
Fernandez is leading
a group of revolutionaries!
They're coming here!
- And what about Bert?
- Bert? I haven't heard anything.
Pedro, I want the men here at once,
and all of them ready to go.
They're trapped at
the end of the valley!
Halt!
Here I am.
Did you change your mind...
...or did you finally decide
not to take on Delgado alone?
I came to tell you that you'd
better get ready for an attack.
- An attack?
- By Delgado.
How many out there?
I'm not sure. But they'll
have reinforcements this time.
I'll be ready. It's going to be a really
old-time battle on horseback.
Come along and help us.
I reckon you know a lot about the
law, but we're not in a courthouse.
We're unprotected now.
Get down!
Didn't you hear Mr. Sullivan?
Get off your horses!
When they get to that point in the
road, give the signal to fire...
...we'll take them by surprise.
The rifle!
Thank you, Sullivan.
Stay where you are, Bert!
And put down that pistol.
Until now, I had nothing against you.
But you made me want to kill you.
I will kill you because you hate me
so. You have a reason to hate me...
...but not my own son!
Is that you, Bert?
I can't see you.
Listen to me...
When you, when you get to Texas...
...can you hear me?
Texas...
...good-bye.
All right, let's get moving.
We've got a long
road ahead of us, Cisco.
We're going back to Texas.
We're going back to Texas.
