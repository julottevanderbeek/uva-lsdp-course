Kung Fu 1x04 - Blood Brother
As quickly as you can,
snatch the pebble from my hand.
When you can take the pebble from
my hand, it will be time for you to leave.
Time for you to leave.
-We ain't allowed to give that information.
-The man who wrote it is my brother.
My half-brother.
-This letter's more than six years old.
-Yes.
Mister, any of them drifters
hang around this town...
...more than six months,
they're doing good.
You better try the next town.
Thank you.
Please come with me.
-l am Caine.
-l am Lin Wu.
Hey, mister,
anything else you want?
These boxes.
l am acquainted with a man
named Lin Wu.
Perhaps this is the same man.
Could you tell me--?
Mister, you've got everything
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
Hey, hold still, l'll put out the fire.
Just trying to help out. Never mind
all that good whiskey going to waste.
How we gonna to put out the fire?
-Throw him in here, huh?
-That's a good idea.
Enough!
Why, what'd you say?
He has had enough.
All right, boys, take it slow.
Back it up. Gently.
-Did you hear him?
-Heard it, memorized it and filed it away.
That bottle looks empty. Come on,
l'm gonna buy you a drink. Come on.
You risked your own safety
in helping me.
We are grateful.
What l did was little enough.
lt is l who am grateful
for your hospitality.
We don't often have the honor
with strangers in this town.
l am merely passing through.
But it has come to my attention that
a countryman of mine may be living here.
Perhaps you could help me to find him.
lf it lies in our power.
His name is Lin Wu.
We are very thoughtless.
Our guest has journeyed far
and is doubtless fatigued.
l don't know you.
l am Caine.
Business here?
l am passing through.
Post office, livery stable, saloon.
For a man passing through,
you've been asking a lot of questions.
Only one. Where is my friend Lin Wu?
How do you know he's here?
l saw boxes addressed to him
at the post office.
-Well, he might have left.
-Perhaps.
Suppose you find him gone?
Well, he's....
West side of town. About a mile out.
He's next to the pond.
Satisfy yourself and take some advice.
Forget about him, then go on your way.
-Dundee.
-Sheriff.
l'd like to talk to you about your boy.
Oh, well, come on in. Talk.
-You heard about the firecracker stunt?
-No.
Well, a bunch of kids
were hazing old Soong.
Soong? One of the nicest Chinamen
in the world. ls he all right?
He's alive.
ls Greg involved?
-Well, you might say he stopped it.
-Oh, glad to hear it.
Dundee, if it happens again,
l'm gonna charge him.
Maybe you should be talking
to some of those other boys.
Yeah, maybe, but we both know
who's top dog in that outfit, don't we?
Well, it won't happen again.
Soong's too smart. He'll stay away.
l'm talking about them staying away
from him or anybody else.
Well, l'll talk to Greg.
Poor old Soong. You wouldn't want
to know an easier man to get along with.
lf all Chinamen was like him, l wouldn't
mind if the town was full of them.
You know how much he gave
for the church...
...knowing all along
he'd never see the inside?
While l'm here, you know Lin Wu?
That the Chinaman lives
at the edge of town?
Yeah. You happen to know where he is?
Who knows what makes
a Chinaman come and go?
They don't think
the way the rest of us do.
l'm talking about one particular man.
So am l.
What are you doing here, John?
My name is Caine.
Sure, John.
Who asked you here?
l'm looking for a friend.
We all are, John...
...but you won't find one here.
You know you're breaking the law?
Trespass.
What is trespass?
Sticking your nose where it don't belong.
Asking questions!
Randy.
l meant no offense.
Of course not.
Now you've got two,
three good hours of daylight left.
Give you plenty of time
to collect your things.
All right?
l seek no trouble.
Get a good start before dark.
Understand?
-l hear what you say.
-Sure you do, John.
Disciple Caine, Disciple Lin Wu,
you are both excellent young men.
Your masters are well-pleased.
You have both learned so well
that it is hard to choose between you.
However, a choice must be made.
lt is the Shaolin way that only one...
...may step upward into the mysteries
of the order at this time.
lt lies between you two.
May l speak, honorable sir?
Let it be Disciple Caine,
for l know him to be my superior.
That is for the masters to decide.
A contest has been arranged between you...
...in which you are enjoined
to strive your utmost.
May l speak, honorable sir?
Let it be Disciple Lin Wu,
for l do not wish to contend against him.
Your friendship and your compassion
do you both honor...
...but the ancient ways carry purpose
and may not be forborne.
The contest will take place tomorrow.
-Pa?
-Yes, son. Come in.
You look nice. You going over
to see the McKenzie girl?
-Yeah.
-You could do worse.
-Pa, l....
-Yes?
Are you in trouble, son?
l don't know, Pa.
Tell me about it.
Well, the other night
me and some of the boys....
-We were just out for a little fun, Pa.
-That the Chinaman, Lin Wu?
Who was there?
Just some of the boys.
Well, you know how l feel
about this kind of thing.
Easiest thing in the world
for it to get out of hand.
-That's why l never wear a gun.
-l didn't have a gun, Pa.
lt's just as well.
Sheriff's been asking questions.
Didn't seem to be anything too serious.
lt could be a whole lot worse.
l just hope it teaches you something.
A man's lucky if he can learn a lesson
without doing too much harm.
-You don't supposed the sheriff--?
-Oh, let him think what he likes.
He doesn't know anything.
Hello.
-Miss Livvy McKenzie?
-Yes.
l am a friend of Lin Wu.
Come in.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Do you know where he is?
That is the question l came to ask you.
lt was empty.
He was supposed to have
come here last night.
May l ask why?
-You have pain?
-Headaches.
-You consulted him as a physician?
-Oh, yes, a lot of us do.
He's helped me.
No one else ever did before.
When was the last time you saw him?
Oh, two nights ago.
-Here? ln this house?
-Yes.
And he has sent you no word?
None.
-Should l leave?
-No.
Greg.
-This is--
-Caine.
-l'm surprised to find you here.
-Yet l am here.
-On what business?
-The same, looking for a friend.
-Well, you won't find one here either.
-Greg--
You keep looking in all
the wrong places.
Caine.
-ls there any way l may help you?
-Why would you help me?
-You have been of service to my father.
-And you are an obedient son?
Suppose your obedience itself
were an injury to your father?
What has happened may happen again.
Tell me of Lin Wu.
You are a man. You must be angry.
To hide such a feeling is to increase
its force 1 000 times.
lt is forbidden to talk of Lin Wu.
But you already have.
Caine.
Tell me about Lin Wu.
l'm keeping him in there overnight
for safekeeping.
His own safety. ln the morning,
l'll get him as far out of town as l can.
lf he's smart, he'll keep moving.
lf he's lucky, he'll make it.
You cannot keep him.
Why?
He is a priest of the Shaolin Temple.
Yeah? So?
A Shaolin priest can walk through walls.
lt is said that listened for,
he cannot be heard...
...looked for, he cannot be seen...
...felt, he cannot be touched.
Bernie will take you home.
Stay there.
-What are you doing with that rifle?
-Nobody's gonna get hurt, Pa.
Nobody?
The Chinaman who broke out of jail,
we figured he'd go to Soong's house.
He had his chance, Pa.
lf you have to use it, don't miss.
-See anything yet?
-No.
Elvis, take two or three of the boys,
go around and cover the back.
A Shaolin priest can walk through walls.
-You wish me to go?
-l wish you never had come.
You can't help Lin Wu.
ls Lin Wu, then, dead?
Why won't you answer?
A man cannot live his whole life in fear.
What have you to fear?
You are a Shaolin priest.
-lf l had your strength....
-You have.
Only look for it.
lt has long been my dream to enter
the Shaolin Temple as a student.
-Tell me of Lin Wu.
-Why must you pursue this?
Why not let the dead rest?
Then he is dead.
Yes.
The contest will continue
until one of you touches the floor.
He who remains on the platform prevails.
You are both enjoined
by your vows to do your utmost.
Tell me how he died.
Like so many of his countrymen,
at the hands of white men.
-Why?
-Why was my father tormented? Ask them.
Where is the body hidden?
Near his house, there
is a large area of swampland.
A body put there may be lost forever.
Unless one knows where to look...
...it is hopeless to search.
Someone knows.
The men who put him there.
ls he here?
Please, he's a young and foolish boy.
Forgive him.
-What did he say?
-Come on!
He told him of the swampland.
Right over there.
-There's nothing there.
-Look, l heard it.
You heard a splash.
lt could have been anything.
lt's Cole.
We'll be shooting each other next.
There's somebody with him.
Who else is there?
Florin, Arlo, a few of the others.
Get them.
You know what you've done?
All he had to do was follow.
You led him right to the spot.
Now you've got no choice.
You all here?
Yeah.
We're going into the swamps
and form a skirmish line 5 feet apart.
See anybody else...
...shoot.
This is a lawful order.
Come out here on the bank.
l guarantee l'll see any man in jail
who disobeys this order. Now.
Doing a little frog hunting, sheriff.
Any law against that?
Mr. Dundee...
...l could charge every man here
with murder.
Murder of who, sheriff?
This man...
...has been beaten to death.
l'll have the names of every man here
on warrants for murder.
A little premature, sheriff.
Don't you need an indictment first?
l'm calling for an inquest
for tomorrow morning.
An inquest means witnesses.
People who are willing to testify,
raking up a lot of muck...
...do nobody any good.
For what? You're over your head, sheriff.
You know how the people
in this town feel.
Nothing like an outsider
stirring up trouble to bring us together.
When you have your inquest, sheriff,
you'll find we all feel the same about this.
-Have you learned nothing?
-You are new to this country.
You must understand, no jury
will indict a white man...
...for what has been done
to one of our people.
Yet you must appear.
-Tell me why.
-lf you stay away...
...it will be an acceptance
of things as they are.
lf you appear at the inquest, your very
presence will be a demand for justice.
The presence of your son, your wife
and your daughter will be worth even more.
You ask me to subject my family to shame?
To hurt? For what reason?
How can they find safety in a fortress
whose walls will burn...
...whose windows will not stop a bullet,
whose doors will yield to anyone...
...with the strength to force them?
How can you hide...
...when the more you remain unseen,
the more they will feel free to seek you out?
May l speak, Father?
lt is my duty to obey.
l respect and revere my father...
...but l have never been prouder
to be his son than last night...
...when he risked my safety...
...and the safety
of my mother and my sister...
...in accordance with the wishes
of the priest.
Who else was with you that night?
Well, it's hard to say.
A lot of people coming and going.
You know how it is.
l remember Pop Fuller,
he dropped by for a drink.
Was Elvis Cooper with you?
-Or Greg Dundee?
-l just don't remember.
Did you go out to Lin Wu's
house that night?
Yeah, l think l was out there.
Did you see Lin Wu?
Well, that's pretty hard to say.
They all look alike to me.
All right, you can step down.
Greg Dundee, come to the stand, please.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth...
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
l do.
-Can l ask a few questions, Bert?
-Yes.
You're acquainted with Livvy McKenzie?
Yes, l know her.
Do you have an understanding with her?
More than one.
-Are you engaged to her?
-Yes, l guess you might say we're engaged.
Did you know that she was being
treated by Lin Wu?
-Treated?
-For a medical complaint.
Are you saying there's
something wrong with her?
She was being treated by a doctor.
She had headaches. ls that so bad?
Bad enough to call in a doctor
for treatments.
Well, she was worried about them.
Scared she'd end up like her mother--
Who died in an asylum
after suffering from headaches?
Greg, did you know that she was treated
the night he died?
You were...
...outside the house when he came out.
You, Randy, Elvis, a couple of others.
All right.
Did you go in to see Livvy
after he left?
-No.
-No.
Well, weren't you curious
to see how she was?
Whether the treatment helped?
Greg?
Or was it that you didn't want
to see her?
You couldn't stand the idea that...
...he might have touched her?
A Chinaman putting his hands on her body.
Dirty, yellow, Chinamen hands
on a white woman.
You followed him home, all of you.
-You took him out--
-Teach him a lesson.
Beat him a little bit,
so he'd keep his hands off white women.
-Lousy, yellow--
-And by the time you finished the lesson...
...he was dead.
So you buried him.
And it was over. No great loss, a Chinaman.
-Laying his dirty, yellow hands on her--
-He never touched me.
He was gentle. So respectful.
He gave me medicines.
He was the only one who ever helped me.
He worked as a doctor. Some of the rest
of you went to him for help.
You, Edith. May.
-He treated your wife, Alex.
-That's right.
lf any of you can think
of anything he did...
...that maybe we should know about,
stand up and tell us.
You all know these boys.
They're good boys, all of them.
High spirits, maybe. Tomfoolery.
They never meant any harm to anyone.
Just scare the Chinaman a little.
Well, they're kids. They're kids.
They got scared.
They buried the body.
Accident.
They had no reason to hurt him.
Two nights.
Two nights after they beat
a man to death, these same...
...kids walked into Soong's store
looking for someone else. Another lesson.
Of course, they ran into
a different problem there.
You think l can't take him?
One finger on my left hand.
-What is he? He's a slant-eye.
-Come on.
What are we talking about here anyway?
All this fuss about killing a Chinaman?
l mean, who needs a reason? l enjoyed it.
l mean, it ain't as if
we was talking about a man.
May l speak?
You tell a man he is something less
than a man, and say it often enough...
...and even he will believe it.
The price he pays is easy to see.
The price you pay is hidden,
but it is just as deep.
lt has been called to question...
...whether the death of Lin Wu
was the death of a man.
This letter l found on his body...
...is addressed to Miss McKenzie.
''Honored Miss:
l ask you to excuse grievous faults
and errors in me...
...for to understand this new language,
this new land...
...occupies my time with great effort.
Be assured that what happened
to your revered mother...
...is of her world, and not yours.
Do not clutch at pain
and pain will pass...
...for l have touched the roots
of your suffering, and they will wither.
ln my country, we say
there is a time for each to die.
lt is not the death that is so drear,
but the fear of death.
Fear is the darkness.
And l wish you to know, gentle lady,
that l am not afraid.
At the end what remains
is not riches, not structures of stone...
...but remembrances of those few people
we have joined spirits with.
Honored lady, l bid you--''
The letter ends.
The purpose of this inquest is to judge
whether there are reasonable grounds...
...to bring a charge of murder
in the death of Lin Wu.
l ask that this jury...
...move an indictment of murder
against Greg Dundee...
...Randy Buckmill, Elvis Cooper, others...
...to be named later.
So moved?
Yea.
Yea.
Yea.
Yea.
-Yea.
-Yea.
lt is so moved.
Lower away.
May his troubled spirit at last find rest.
-And you?
-Mine will be at peace.
This journey to the Shaolin Temple
is one l had long wished to make.
Student Soong.
Ready to roll.
l will miss you, my father.
And you, old man?
Are your spirits heavy?
Lighter perhaps at this moment
than they have ever been, or will be again.
The father learns from the son.
But the father learns.
lt is perhaps enough.
