We have an answer for you
from New Orleans.
What 'd they say?
"Sundowner sails at 21st.
Stop.
Destination Europe.
Stop. Reservation...
confirmed. Stop.
Request deposit 5OO dollars. Stop."
- Hey! What about the 5OO dollars?
- Don't worry.
The important thing is
there's a ship.
Hey!
How'd he do it, Pa?
I know he had one shot!
It 's a question of speed, son.
Pa, ain't nobody faster than him?
Faster than him?
Nobody.
Red!
Too late to meet you.
Who did it?
You did...
when you first started
looking for me.
Where's Nevada?
Hold up in Acoma.
He ain't about to move from there.
What were you doing here?
Who shot you?
- Go...
- Where?
You go screw yourself.
You and you alone...
was responsible to me and
my men for making the gold legal.
Instead, Sullivan, you chase
after your own personal affairs!
You're leaving a trail of dead bodies
all the way across the state!
A trail that leads straight here.
- Jack Beauregard.
- Yeah.
We pay you 'cause
you're respectable.
A gentleman!
Bought a worked out gold mine
and discovered a new vein.
But any suspicion that falls on you,
falls on the gold.
What are you afraid of?
You got everyone exactly
where you want them.
I've reached out the truth
from the rooftops.
I could bring the sheriff
in here and say:
"Look, if we didn't add
that stolen gold of yore...
this mine would
only produce rocks!"
I could even show them
and nobody would believe me.
- And they'd all be blind and deaf.
- But not dumb!
There's talk going around,
Sullivan.
Talk has a way of getting into places
where there ain't no fear.
The ore that
comes out of this mine...
has got to be refined legally!
You keep your hands clean,
Sullivan.
But if I don't kill Beauregard first,
he'll kill me.
That 's right.
Two things go straight to a
man's heart: bullets and gold.
You're telling me
to buy Jack Beauregard?
Why not?
We bought you.
Buy him or kill him!
But do it fast.
Do you hear me?
Fast!
Hey! Load up 2O
of them horseshoes.
- Is it going to take much longer?
- Nearly that.
You got nothing but junk here.
Look at this.
Who's gonna buy this?
And this?
Even a broken shoe.
Hey! You!
Hey, where'd he come from?
What are you doing in there?
- Sleeping.
- This ain't no hotel.
- What are you looking for?
- A horse.
Hey, make him pay first!
Why?
'Cause you don't look like you're
gonna live long enough to get credit.
Where are you going?
The secret of a long life
is to try not to shorten it.
Hey! Hold on there!
- Maybe I can get you a horse.
- Honest?
Sure. But first you got
to do me a little favor.
Come here.
Gimme here!
There's a pal of mine
over there in that saloon.
You take him this basket. When
you get back, I'll find you a horse.
This pal of yours is
Jack Beauregard, huh?
A bargain is a bargain.
- A horse, huh?
- Sure, son.
The best.
I smell beans and bacon, Bonita.
That 's right. They're for
the three men out there.
Better let me have it. I don't think
they'll be hungry much longer.
Is the ship still there?
"Sailing takes 16 days.
Stop.
Must have 5OO dollars
to confirm reservation. Stop."
What should I tell
New Orleans, mister?
There's still 16 days.
Even for someone like you.
If you go away,
who's gonna be left?
Nobody.
Maybe so, but a man's
gotta quit sometime.
Sometime.
But someone like you
gotta go out with style.
You come here
just to tell me that?
Oh, no.
For me?
What 'd you think it 's in it?
I reckon it 's a bomb.
I reckon you're right.
Who sent it?
Three fellows out there.
Only three.
- Only?
- Yeah, like that time in El Paso.
Billy Mason...
John Murray...
Fred Carson.
In April...
- Why'd you bring me this for?
- A horse.
Like I was saying, in April,
in Albuquerque...
four: Jackson,
Johnson, Murdoch...
and Champion.
How many horses do you
want to take it back?
None. My pleasure.
But it was in the fall
that you really scored.
September. Socorro.
Five.
Milton, Woolman, Firestone,
McDonald and Valence.
How come you know
so much about me?
Everyone knows about
Jack Beauregard.
Only hope for law and order
in the West.
Son, let me give you
a little advice.
If you start admiring someone,
pretty soon you're envious...
so you start showing off,
taking chances.
Before you know it,
you're dead.
Well, it ain't good for some folks
to live too long.
And in Gila Blend,
how many did you get that time?
Six. Oh, no! Seven!
Counting that fellow that tried to gun
you when you were backwards to him.
He says he don't want it!
But you never got
You know, since I was a boy
I always dreamed of you like that.
An immense open plain.
on horseback...
and you facing them.
Alone.
Why only 15O?
The Wild Bunch.
They are only 15O. That 's why.
Yeah, 15O and shooting right
like there's thousands.
Who are you anyway?
- Who? Me? Nobody.
- Tell you what...
first you get to be somebody,
then you and me will surround them.
Yeah. Hey, that 's no good.
You got to face them alone!
You on one side,
and them on the other!
You won't need
to wash it this time!
What was in that basket?
Do you want a hand?
Hey, Jack!
Jack, I've found a horse!
Wait!
Turn around, you!
- You mean we gotta shoot it out?
- So you're Beauregard's friend?
I wish I was.
You know what they say?
He could draw his gun 3 times before
the other fellow even starts reaching.
Like this.
Well, if we gotta shoot it out,
I'm ready.
Well, just...
Hey, you gotta admit,
he did deliver the basket.
Yeah, sure.
- But that son of...
- Beauregard. He didn't want it.
You're right!
Guess you won yourself a horse.
Thanks, "amigo".
I'll take this one.
Help me!
"Arinauabecapicapa."
"Arinaua. Arinaua."
Blessed is the man who shares
his neighbor's burden.
Seen a white man around here?
I'm looking for a white man.
Did you see him?
Where is he?
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.
He's my brother.
What are you doing here?
Praying.
- Good thing you are.
- Why?
'Cause you're always following me,
and I don't like it.
I got a lot of friends here.
Chief Broken Branch
died yesterday.
The priest got there in time,
but the Medicine men didn't.
What brings you here
among the ancients anyway?
I'm looking for someone.
"Sam Peckinpah".
That 's a beautiful name
in Navajo.
- Friend or enemy?
- That 's my business.
Listen to this one.
"Renapoknomoh".
- What 's his name?
- That 's his business.
"Nevada Kid".
You know where he is?
Must be down below.
It 's always the best
who are the first to go.
Which means you
ain't going nowhere.
Stay here with your
Indian friends for good.
What 's the matter, boy?
You gotta have a crowd watching?
You said you was nobody.
Here's your chance to make a name
for yourself on one of them.
Turn around!
Draw.
Let 's bring my personal
history up to date.
Today, June 3rd, 1899:
Nobody.
You're the kind that needs
an audience so you can show off.
Four shots, one hole.
Just like the good old days.
There was never any
"good old days".
Tell me, what 's your game?
When I was a kid I used to make
believe I was Jack Beauregard.
And now that
you're all growed-up?
I'm more cautious.
But sometimes running a little risk...
can bring bigger rewards,
you know?
If the risk is little,
the reward is little.
First Nevada... then Red.
- They even tried to get me twice.
- They'll try again.
What the hell are you up to?
You'll find out.
I see clear as crystal...
Jack Beauregard, standing alone,
facing the Wild Bunch.
Just think of it. You'll be written up
in all the History books!
You'll be down on earth
reading them.
While I'm up there
playing on a harp.
You shine like a door
of a whorehouse.
A blind man can spot
you 1O miles off.
Well, I like folks to see me.
Maybe folks don't share
your pleasure.
Thanks.
But I prefer my own. Lets the
air through. Charms the wits.
It 's just a matter of time before
someone's gonna shoot holes in yours!
Out of the way, shorty!
Or I'll crush you underfoot
like a flee!
You don't look so smart from up here.
I can't hardly see you!
You got the message?
See me better now?
I wish I'd never seen you!
Here's a go!
Anybody else?
Come on!
Anybody else wants to try?
I wanna try.
Have another try.
It 's like courting a woman, folks.
You give her the glad eye,
she gives you a black eye!
You offer her a beefsteak,
she grinds your meat. Hurry, hurry!
Come on out here and have a try!
Come on now, folks! Get ready!
He's all yours! If you're close
to him, he doesn't swing.
Use your skill to hit their heads!
Let 's see who gets the prize tonight!
He who scores five hits
will get the prize tonight!
Come on, folks!
Give them anything you want!
Three hits for only half a dollar!
Seven for only a dollar!
And for the price of only two dollars,
I'll offer you six, I mean...
six ripe cantaloupes!
And when I say ripe, believe me...
...I mean ripe. Come on!
- Let me try it.
Come on!
Move your arms now!
Come on, folks!
Give them what you want!
Close it fast!
Let them thrown!
Come on!
Move your arms now!
Watch your aim!
Come on, everybody!
Give them everything you've got.
The fun of the game...
What did you say
the fun of the game is?
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna stay
as long as I like!
I got as much right
as anyone to be here!
Sleep tight, grandpa!
You stinky-minding pokeheads!
One of these days, the worm is gonna
churn and nip you all right in the butt!
You tell your
stinking boss Sullivan!
Who the hell are you?
I'll take 3 on Squirrel!
Another 1O dollars on Squirrel.
Folks!
Bring them on on Squirrel!
He's a quick shot, folks,
but he can also miss!
Come on, now!
This could be your lucky chance!
Hi.
Beer.
- How'd you like to play with this?
- Like that?
Hey, what 's the game?
Can I play too?
Sure.
Anyone can play.
If you can afford it,
if you can shoot...
and if you can drink.
Okay, I'll have a go.
- 1O... 2O.
- You know the rules:
you gotta hit the glass
before it hits the floor.
Come on, folks! Who'll take me on?
Place your bets.
Who'll take 2 to 1
on the stranger?
Any takers? Come on, folks!
Hey, Marshal!
Marshal, here!
Can I do with milk?
Okay, 5!
Come on, folks, 5 to 1!
Come on!
Who'll take me on?
Here's 6 for me, marshal!
Lucky skunk!
That one got away.
Lucky bastard!
Come on now, 7 to 1!
Who'll take me on?
Lucky shit!
Hold it!
The game is over.
- Lucky...
- That he wasn't aiming at you.
Here you are. 2OO.
Give me a whisky.
These games sure make a man thirsty.
That evens
the score for glasses.
Now let 's try pistols.
These upside down pistols
of yours really worry me.
Fellows that carry them
like that are bad men.
Clown.
- Now you can't miss.
- Smart aleck.
Those like you never
seem to catch on.
It 's actually very simple.
Now pay attention.
Have you?
We play for higher
stakes up here.
Look who's talking to you.
Why don't you join us?
It ain't nice to shoot
a man in the back.
Is it a game that two can play?
If you know the rules.
For me, every game
has the same rule.
Play to win.
The whole town's gotta
see this game.
Big audience, big take.
Two thousand.
Who's gonna lose this hand?
Loser will be here tomorrow morning.
Name's Jack Beauregard.
That 's a name to reckon with.
How much do you reckon?
Five hundred?
A thousand more, perhaps.
I reckon I may never spend
it. Why Jack Beauregard?
Will this do for an answer?
You paid for a front row
seat. Don't miss the show.
I won't.
Hey!
That 's only three shots.
You still got one to go.
The next one might hit
a couple of inches lower.
Your life is hanging by
a thread, Mr. Beauregard.
Looks like you finally got your
audience, so I guess we can...
...wind up this little story.
- It 's an old story for you.
January '86. Madison.
Same situation, remember?
Except I was facing
three bastards that day.
Exactly.
Seems like that hole was just
aching for another bullet.
Remember, boys, when
the spirit is willing...
the flesh has the strength of ten.
- Can I send a telegram?
- Yes, sir.
It will cost you 25 cents a word.
Maritime Company, New Orleans.
Request confirmation reservation
Sundowner sailing 12 day. Stop.
Signed: Jack Beauregard.
Look who's back.
What are you holding
that up there for?
Idiots!
You go catch those two.
He's gone into the corner room.
Come on. Quiet.
Up there. I guess he's asleep.
I heard him setting his alarm clock.
Well, this'll awake him
quicker than any alarm.
He must be right up there.
I'll go.
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.
- He must be on the other side.
- I'm here.
- Break a mirror is bad luck.
- Give me a match.
Light it.
Well, it only last one minute.
Light it!
Don't... don't you think
I ought to get down?
People go around wasting
days and weeks and years...
and all of a sudden there's
only 3O seconds to go.
No! Wait! I got stuck in!
It stopped.
It happens to everyone,
sooner or later.
Don John, where are you?
I'm here.
Me too.
Wait! Bang!
Thank you, man.
- It 's real funny!
- Nothing funny about death.
Shut up!
There are eight of them!
- Look!
- What a lot of nobody!
Reflection is one and all.
But in truth there's only one.
- Guess which is that son of a gun.
- The third one!
You really are slippin'. Hold this.
Who? Me?
Yes, you!
- Well?
- Well...
Nevada and that other
sneak thief Wayne...
had pulled me out.
For 2OO dollars!
My part was all I had. My share of
the mine for 2OO stinking dollars!
And then the bank shifted.
I got so mad it gave me asthma!
That 's the way I'm forced to live
now. I have to breath this shit!
I don't want to talk no more
about that stinking business.
Ain't no use in persisting!
If you want to persist...
you'll have to persist harder!
It was Red himself who told me.
The whole story.
That ain't no mine. It 's
just a hole in the ground.
Nobody ain't never gonna
find no gold in there.
That city sleeker. That Sullivan...
he wants to buy it for 6OO dollars.
And that ain't hay dough.
But he could live on your
share of it for a year.
That 's what they told me.
- Then what?
- The year run out...
the money run out,
and the liquor run out.
Here, this'll quench your thirst.
And cut to the point 'cause
I got no more dough either.
Damnation! That mine
began pouring out gold...
like the mine was made of it.
And I say I deserve a share.
At least enough to keep me in liquor.
And what did Red and Nevada do?
They ran off somewhere.
The dirty coyotes!
Red and Nevada are dead. You
can drink to their memory.
It 's like I said, he who lives by
the sword will get nipped in the butt.
No, no, no! I surrender!
Next time, knock before
you come busting in.
Are you playing games?
There'd been a lot of
guys trying to kill me...
just so they can brag about
it for the rest of their lives.
You had your audience this
morning and you had your target.
That kind of opportunity
don't knock twice.
Well, it depends on
your point of view.
- It 's a dangerous game.
- Yeah.
It ain't easy to make balls spin.
But even if you do, sooner or later,
they're bound to wind up in the hole.
It 's gone in! It 's gone in!
Missed by a hair!
Fact is you saved my life today.
But I'd rather is my fault I got
shot, than your fault I didn't.
That 's a pile of horse manure, son.
It 's better not to get
shot for nobody's fault.
Why did you blow in these
balls? I don't count.
- I wanted to let out some air.
- While you're letting out all that air...
suppose you tell me why you were
sitting in the street this morning.
I got tired of standing.
You keep turning your back to me.
Seems like you trust me too much,
or maybe you trust yourself too much.
You ever heard the story
about the little birdy?
My grandpa used to tell it to me.
When I was a boy, man didn't live
long enough to become grandpas.
It wasn't easy, son,
but it could be that.
See?
There was this little birdie who
didn't even know how to fly yet.
One freezing cold night, he tumbles
out of his nest, lands on the ground.
well, he starts going...
like crazy 'cause he's
damn nearly freezing!
Lucky for him. Along comes this cow...
sees him, and feels
sorry for him. So...
she lifts her tail...
and... drops a steaming
hot cowpat right on him.
The little birdie is
nice and warm again...
but it still ain't
happy and keeps going...
Iouder than ever.
A mean old coyote hears
him and comes on running.
He reaches out a paw...
and pulls him out of the cow pie.
He brushes the dirt
on him real nice...
and then...
swallows the birdie down in one gulp!
Grandpa said there
was a moral there...
but you have to figure
it out for yourself.
Bird...
coyote... cow pie... don't
make no sense to me, not at all.
You still believe in fairy tales.
Yeah.
For example...
this is a good guy who's
gotta avenge his brother.
And this is the bad guy...
who's gonna get killed because
he shot the good guy's brother.
- And this... - Is
my blue-eyed angel...
who protects me from harm.
That 's Nobody.
That leaves you and me face to face.
No.
That leaves you alone...
against 15O.
You're sure trying hard
to make a hero out of me.
You're that already. You
just need a special act.
Something to make your name a legend.
What I don't understand is:
what difference it makes to you?
A man who is a man needs
someone to believe in.
I've had all kinds in my life...
thieves and killers...
pimps and prostitutes...
con men and preachers.
Even a few fellows
that told the truth.
The kind of man you're
talking about, never.
Maybe you've never met them...
but hardly ever they're
the only ones who count.
Reckon this fellow's name is Sullivan?
I reckon it is.
Hey! Hey!
He's taking Sullivan away!
But Sullivan is nothing. It 's
the Wild Bunch on the back of him.
We've got to warn that gent fella.
Don't you see? If he kills Sullivan...
he'll have 15O blood thirsty
cutthroats on his tail!
He's gonna make trouble for himself.
No, he's gonna make
a name for himself.
The way he's galloping, he
must be in a hurry to make it.
If you kill me, the Wild Bunch will
know that you're on to their game.
They told me, kill him or buy him.
I wouldn't have tried,
unless it was my last chance.
You know what Nevada was like.
We had a little agreement...
him, Red and me, for an
extra share between us.
But you know even better than
me how he hated sharing anything.
And he deserved the
bullet he got. Red did it.
But I kept his share.
And it 's yours now.
Take all you want.
You can live like a
king for 1OO years.
I don't intend to get that old.
I only need 5OO.
Is there a telegraph office in town?
- How do I get a train for New Orleans?
- Follow the tracks east of Kimble.
There is a train from
there every Friday.
Disappointed?
Yep.
I thought I could count
on your brotherly feeling.
Beats me how kids like you think
if a man's older than you...
he goes along with old
fashioned notions like...
like "blood is thicker than water".
Sure Nevada was my brother...
but he was a grade A skunk
who shot people in the back.
And what 's more, he stole
I ain't risking my life to avenge him.
My, my! How modern the
old folks are becoming!
But a hero can't run
away from his destiny.
My destiny is to get
the hell out of here.
I've got an appointment with a
ship that 's sailing for Europe.
Sometimes you run smack
into your destiny...
on the very road you
take to get away from it.
If you're still thinking about
the Wild Bunch, forget it.
I ain't taking them on.
You will, Jack. You will.
Put it over there.
Hold it!
- Where is it going?
- Use your eyes, man.
Ain't it certain?
But...
who's driving it? Who?
They've stolen the train!
but they rlde llke
they were thousands.
But someone llke you has
gotta go out with style.
150 pure bred sons of
bitches on horseback...
You'll be written up
In all Hlstory books.
And you'll be down
on earth readlng them.
Well...
now you got me in the History books...
...how do I quit?
- There's only one way.
How's that?
You gotta die.
Where?
Where there's lots of people.
They gonna shoot each other!
Come on! Let 's get out of the way!
I told you your life
was hanging by a thread.
dylng Is not the worse thlng
that can happen to a man.
Look at me. I've been dead for3 days
and now I've flnally found my peace.
You used to say that my
llfe was hanglng by a thread.
Maybe so,but I'm afrald that's your
llfe that's hanglng by a thread now.
Well, that 's one.
Let 's get the other!
And there's quite a few people
who'd llke to cut that thread.
Yeah,I guess it's your
way of feellng allve.
You see,it's the whole
dlfference between you and me.
I've always trled to
steer away from trouble...
but you seem to be looklng
for it all the tlme.
But,I must admit,you've been
able to solve your share...
even If you llke others
to take the credit.
You got it all nlcely flgured out.
But you gambled too blg thls tlme...
and there's too many people who
know you're somebody after all...
and you won't have much tlme
for playlng your funny games.
They'll make llfe harder
and harder foryou...
untll you too meet somebody who
wants to put you down In Hlstory.
And so you'll flnd out that the
only way to become a Nobody agaln...
Anyhow, from now on you'll
be walklng In my boots...
and maybe you won't be
laughlng so loud anymore.
you can preserve a
little of that Illuslon...
Maybe you'll do it In
your own funny way but...
seems to me we were all a
bunch of romantlc fools...
who stlll belleved
that a good plstol...
and qulck showdown
could solve everythlng.
when you never ran Into
the same person twlce.
At the tlme you came
along it was changed.
and we kept bumplng on the
same people all the tlme.
But If you're able to run around In
the West peacefully,catchlng flles...
it's only because fellows
llke me were there flrst.
The same fellows you wanna see
written up In Hlstory books.
'Cause people need somethlng
to belleve In,llke you say.
But you won't be able to have
it yourown way much longer...
because the country
aln't the same anymore...
and I'm already feellng
the strange In myself.
But, what's worse,
vlolence has changed too.
and a good plstol don't
mean a damn thlng anymore.
'cause it's your klnd
of tlme, not mlne.
And I also flgured out the
moral to your grandpa story.
The one about the cow that
coverthe little blrd of cow ple...
to keep it warm and then the
coyote hold it out and eat it.
It's the moral of these
new tlmes of yours.
Folks that throw dlrt on you
aren't always trylng to hurt you.
And folks that pull you out of a
jam aren't always trylng to help you.
when you're up to your nose
In shit, keep your mouth shut.
And thls Is why you
faked than gun flght...
Anyhow,it's gettlng to
be one more old tlmer.
And the years don't make
wlsdom, they just make old age.
One can be young In years
and be old In hours,llke you.
I guess I'm talklng llke a damn
preacher,but it's your fault.
What can you expect
of a natlonal monument?
And If you ever meet one of
those many I almost never meet...
you can keepeach othercompany
and it won't be so lonely foryou.
They say dlstance makes
frlendshlp grow stronger.
Maybe so. 'Cause afterthree days
without you dogglng my tracks...
even If you were a stlnklng
nosy troublemaker all the tlme...
P. S: just one more plece
of advlce from an old tlmer:
be sure the rlght man
Is wearlng the jacket.
