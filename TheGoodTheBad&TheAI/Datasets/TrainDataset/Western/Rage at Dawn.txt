Look.
There's Dobe.
Tell him we got it, Roy.
All right, boys.
Now, they're on their way.
Now don't anybody
get over anxious.
These Renos ain't
ordinary robbers.
They got instincts like animals.
At the least wrong movement,
we could lose them,
So wait 'til they come out
of the bank with the money.
Understand?
Out of the bank.
All right, now you deputies,
take your positions.
The rest of you people, take
your places along the street
Like we planned.
Little one's three cents,
and the big one's five.
Renos are coming!
MAN :
Renos are coming.
Too bad Mr. Peterson
has to miss this.
I don't think we can
get the Renos to weep.
They ready in the bank?
They've got everything set.
Good.
Clear the street!
The Renos are coming!
The Renos!
Now there's North Vernon, boys.
Nice and casually.
Remember today, you're
a couple of farmers.
You all set?
Get down out of
sight and stay down.
Now wait 'til they
come out of the bank.
This time, we're going to
nail 'em with the goods.
Awful quiet, Frank.
Yeah.
I don't like it.
It ain't natural.
There ought to be
more people around.
It's got to be natural.
Nobody knowed we
was coming but us.
Make it easier to get away.
Frank's right.
I don't like it either.
You getting jumpy in
your old age, John?
Quiet.
What do you say, Frank?
Keep going.
We put in too much
time to pass it up.
Well, we're in it now, Frank.
Might as well go
through with it, huh?
What do you say, Frank?
We'll take it.
MAN : It's a trap!
You fools!
MAN : Come on!
He can't leave now.
How bad is he hit?
He's dead.
Come on, Sim.
Ride!
Let's ride!
We couldn't arrest 'em over
there even if we caught 'em.
Jackson County.
The Renos run it
from top to bottom.
Well, we got one
of 'em, anyway.
Yeah.
Let's head back.
Is that going to help?
Is that going to bring
Bill back to life?
Take it easy, Sis.
How?
Not knowing when
you go out that door
If you're ever coming back.
This time it was Bill, and
the next time, somebody else.
That's the way it is, Laura.
It doesn't have to be.
You could leave the state.
You could go somewhere where
nobody ever heard of the Renos.
Where would that be?
Anywhere.
It was my fault, honey.
I smelled it.
I smelled it.
Ain't no use carrying
on about it now.
Important thing is, how did
they know we was coming?
Yeah, how did they know?
And so far ahead.
Maybe somebody
recognized you last week
When you were sizing up the job.
Maybe.
But how did they know
when we was coming?
Is that our dear brother?
Yes.
So it's finally happened.
A Reno got killed.
Clint, we want no preachin'.
Take it easy, Sim.
The baby of the family
dying in the streets
With his big, brave
brothers running away.
Not even animals would
do a thing like that.
Dead in the street.
Not dying.
As if that made any difference.
That's enough of that
kind of talk, Clint.
We sent for you,
Clint, um, because we
Want you to go to North Vernon
and... and get Bill's body.
They'll let you have it.
You mean they won't arrest me.
A Reno that's honest.
That's quite a distinction in
this community, an honest Reno.
We run into an ambush.
Somebody told 'em we was coming.
That shouldn't surprise you.
The Renos are worth
a lot of money, dead.
You knowed we was going.
You accuse me of
being a traitor.
I'll kill you.
Wouldn't put it past you,
you mealy mouthed song singer.
He was right fond
of Bill, Clint.
So was I. I tried
hard enough to keep him
From pitching in with you.
And you, as long as you live,
don't you ever accuse me
Of being an informer again.
You got plans, keep
'em to yourself.
I don't want to know about
'em, not even accidentally.
You won't.
You're notorious outlaws.
The law will get
you sooner or later,
And they'll get you any way
they can, in the back, ambushed,
While you're sleeping,
they'll get you.
Bill's death was
only the beginning.
Can't you see that, Laurie?
Can't you see it?
I'm not doing anything.
You're harboring 'em.
What do you expect me to do?
Pa would never have
left you the house
If he had known how you
were going to use it.
I can't turn my
own brothers out.
How far does loyalty go?
They're not only
destroying themselves,
They're destroying you, too.
Leave her alone, Clint.
Peterson won't leave her alone.
He won't leave any of you alone.
We can handle anything that
Peterson throws our way.
Like you did today?
All right.
I'll go to North
Vernon and get Bill.
We'll bury him beside Ma and Pa.
Perhaps their souls will be
a little less troubled now.
Three of a kind.
Such gall.
Such unmitigated gall.
Those kind would
never be elected
If the womenfolk could vote.
Yes, and we'll get
the vote one day.
Nobody to blame but ourselves.
We voted 'em in.
Well, why don't we
do something about it?
Have you've forgotten?
Edelbach tried.
Look what happened to him.
We'd best let Peterson take
care of the Reno brothers.
He was waiting for us,
loaded up and waiting.
Somebody told
him we was comin'.
Maybe Peterson's got
a man planted in town.
Who knowed you was
going to North Vernon?
You three.
Now hold on, Frank.
He's not accusing us, Judge.
He knows we wouldn't
kill the golden geese.
Did Clint know you was going?
It wasn't Clint.
He ain't one of
us, but he wouldn't
Have no part of
settin' up an ambush.
Maybe it was Sim.
He's kind of talky
when he's drinking.
Yeah, and he does most of his
drinking at Murphy's place.
Yeah, and his bragging.
And Murphy's the only new
man to come to town in years.
Do you suppose
Murphy's a Peterson man?
Gimme a beer, Murphy.
Hello, Sim.
Doing a little drinking, eh?
Yeah, going to do a lot more.
Shot him in the back.
They shot him in the back.
Yeah, I heard about Bill.
What happened over
in North Vernon?
I made a mistake.
I shot too fast, woke up
the town, and they got Bill.
Shot him in the back.
All my fault.
Clumsy.
All my fault.
Hm, I don't think Bill
would have felt that way.
He always thought
you were the best.
I was the best 'til...
'til I made that mistake.
I let Bill down and...
And now he's dead.
He's dead.
Yeah, we all have to
go sooner or later.
But they're going to go sooner.
Come Saturday, we're going
back to North Vernon and blast
The devil out.
We'll get even for Bill, and
this time, we'll get the money.
We'll get the money this time.
Murphy!
What happened?
He closed the saloon about 10.
I followed him home.
Through the window, I saw
him write a note first,
Then he went out the barn,
saddled a horse, and left.
Where'd he go?
Up the Glendale road.
Couldn't follow
without him knowing it.
How long ago was that?
But where does
he mail this note?
They don't.
He hides it someplace
for another Peterson man
To pick up.
A stinkin' spy.
We'll find out about
that soon enough.
You reckon he'll
be home by now?
We'll wait.
We've got time.
Tell Dobe to get the horses.
Dobe, I'm ready to mount.
Why, Frank.
Where you been, Murphy?
Riding.
One o'clock in the morning?
Is there some rule about
when a man go riding?
You stinkin' spy.
Spy?
What are you talking about, Sim?
You're a Peterson man.
Peterson man?
You're crazy.
Don't lie to us, Murphy.
You know me, boys.
You've known me for a long time.
Yeah.
We know you tipped
off Peterson that we
Was going to raid the
bank in North Vernon.
Why would I do that?
'Cause you're
gettin' paid for it.
You just delivered
a letter saying
We were going to hit
North Vernon again,
Didn't you, Murphy?
I don't know where
you got such an idea.
We baited you, Murphy.
Simmy just played
like he was gettin'
Drunk and givin' away secrets.
We knowed that'd flush
you out, and Cortright
Saw you writin' a letter.
Cortright's lyin'.
Get a rope.
You kill me, Frank,
somebody else will come.
We'll handle him, too.
Tie him up to the stall there.
John, get that
horse out of there.
Maybe we ought to
let him come too,
So he can know what's happening.
We got time.
There's another
letter for Peterson.
Monk Claxton's here, Dad.
Oh good.
Have him come in.
Come on in, Monk.
Thank you, Bill.
Hello, Mr. Peterson.
Glad to see you, Monk.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
How are things in Denver?
Couldn't be better, Bill.
Did you read about Murphy?
Yes, sir.
I did.
That's what happens when
something goes wrong.
They're shrewd, those
Renos, and vicious.
Control the whole county
in southern Indiana...
Judge, prosecutor,
constable, all on their side.
Renos had 'em elected.
I still wonder how a thing
like that could happen.
Well people who've
had freedom as long
As we have sometimes
take it for granted.
Come election day,
they're lazy or callous.
Same thing.
However, it's done.
Our job is to get it undone.
Yes, sir.
How do we go about it?
You're a married man, Monk.
Yes, sir.
My wife knows the
line of work I'm in.
I don't want you to
jump into this thing.
I didn't know exactly
what you had in mind,
But to bring me all the way from
Denver, the way I figure it,
This is sort of a promotion.
Well, don't let your
vanity get in the way
Of your better judgment, Monk.
I'm a working man,
Bill, with a job to do.
If I didn't like my work, I'd
have gotten out of it long ago.
In the war, we called
it calculated risk.
Yeah, we did.
I've got a new man I want
you to work with, Monk.
I don't figure this is a
time to break in a greenhorn.
Oh, new to us, that is.
He's had some experience
along this line.
Maybe not experience with
this kind of violence,
But I think he's the
kind of a man that
Can handle himself
in rough going.
Name is James Barlow.
Barlow.
Hm, I see you remember him.
If it's the same James
Barlow I'm thinking of,
I do remember him.
He is.
He was in the employ
of the southern states.
Which we found
out after the war.
Mr. Greeley said that he
was worth a whole army.
It's the only thing
that Mr. Greeley ever
Said that Mr.
Lincoln agreed with.
I still wonder how he got
hold of so many secrets.
Certain generals' wires
found him very charming.
Irresistible is the word, Dad.
As a matter of fact, I recall...
Well, I wasn't the only one
that invited him to dinner.
Secretary Stanton had him too.
Immodest as it may sound,
man could fool Stanton
And me could fool the Reno boys.
That sounds mighty
reasonable, sir.
You are to trust
him implicitly.
Let him run the whole show.
How does he plan to get
in with the Reno brothers?
He doesn't.
He plans to let them
get in with him.
In making out your report to
the sheriff on this robbery,
My description is as follows.
Six feet three, 195 pounds,
hazel eyes, and brown hair.
Six three, 195 pounds,
hazel eyes, and brown hair.
We just hit the grate.
Be about half a minute.
Good.
Pull the cord.
I'll get the .
Now, you want me
to dump the box
When you give me the signal.
After I jump, take
a few shots at me.
Remember, I took your gun but
you had another one hidden.
First I take some shots at you.
When the train stops,
I give the alarm.
Right.
Open the door.
Right on schedule, Jim.
Morning.
Morning.
Ain't that old man Euall's rig?
Yes.
He's my uncle.
I'd like a side of salt
meat, 10 pounds of sugar,
Five pounds of coffee, some
baking soda, and a bathtub.
All right, Mister.
Morning.
Good morning.
I take it you're Jim
Barlow, Noah Euall's nephew.
That's right.
Said a couple of days
ago he was expecting you.
Staying at the farm?
Mm-hm.
Hear you're a painter.
Yes, I am.
What do you paint?
Oh, um, things, people.
Like El Greco,
Rembrandt, Van Dyke.
Not quite.
Oh, um, this is Mr. Claxton.
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
You a painter too?
No.
I'm just looking
after Mr. Barlow.
He's not fully
recovered from the war.
Oh.
Morning, Miss Laura.
Good morning, Mr. Fisher.
Um, is my order ready?
Yes.
Just finished it.
Oh, um, Miss Reno,
this is Mr. Barlow.
How do you do, Mr. Barlow?
It's a pleasure, Miss Reno.
Noah Euall's nephew.
He's a painter.
Oh?
SHOPKEEPER :
Will that be all, sir?
Excuse me, please.
Mm-hm.
Um, $3.20.
Mr. Fisher, can you change this?
Mr. Barlow.
Have you got anything smaller?
Sorry.
I haven't.
Mm.
Take all my change.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you very much
and come again.
I'll do that.
I'll be around for some time.
There you are, Miss Laura.
May I help?
Oh, don't bother.
Quite the contrary.
Well, thank you.
Who's that with Laura?
I never seen him before.
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you
again, Miss Laura.
May I call on you sometime?
Boy.
I'm afraid not, Mr. Barlow.
Who are you, Mister?
That's none of
your business, Pete.
Better be on your way, you.
I bet your pardon.
You heard him.
On your way.
My friends, you have
very good manners.
Monk.
Take his gun belt.
Sorry, Miss Laura.
Still up to your
old tricks, eh?
$30,000, Frank.
That's a heap of money.
Are you out of your mind?
I told you.
We didn't do this train robbery.
The robber wore a mask, had
hazel eyes and sandy hair,
Was around 35
years old, six feet
Three inches,
weight, 195 pounds.
The description fits you, John.
Careful, Lattimore.
Fits a lot of
other people, too.
$30,000.
The judge would be
mighty pleased to share
In a heap of money like that.
We didn't do it.
But I wish we had.
Don't argue with him, sir.
You're in no position
to get uppity.
Listen.
You've got your full portion
of every job we've ever pulled,
And you'll go right
on gettin' it,
So don't come around
here accusing us
Of holding out on you.
All right, Frank.
But as prosecuting attorney
of this country, I warn you.
You sure was rough on him.
Be rougher not to
accuse us anymore.
Sit around doing nothing
while we take all the chances.
At least he's in the hole.
You've got to pay
for aces in the hole.
$30,000 is a heap of money.
Now, who'd have thought
of holding up a train?
Seems like a business
worth considerin'.
What was the matter with them?
Oh, money crazy as usual.
They're accusing John
of holding up the train.
Yeah, but Frank shut
'em up real proper.
You think it's smart
to make them mad?
They'd better worry
about making me mad.
How'd it go?
Fine, Noah.
You set it up well.
Good.
Buy some extra shootin' iron?
No.
We met a young lady.
Two gentlemen objected.
Turned out to be a couple
of fellas named Lee and Pete.
Oh, they're a couple
of the Reno gang.
The family?
No.
Just henchmen.
Oh.
Well, you certainly started
the ball rolling, all right.
We sure did.
That's the object.
But the description
does fit John Reno.
John Reno didn't do it.
He never does
anything by himself.
Frank does all the thinkin'.
Frank didn't do it, either.
Mind don't run that way.
You're too suspicious.
We got a right
to be suspicious.
Our share keeps gettin'
smaller and smaller.
First thing you know, they'll
deal us out completely.
How can they?
We'll be reelected next
month for two more years.
They know which side
their bread's buttered on.
You think we can get away
with this for two more years?
Our collusion with
the Reno brothers
Is one of the worst
kept secrets in history.
Collusion, conspiracy,
malfeasance.
Ugly words, your
honor, but true.
We've got to be realistic.
The bank job in North Vernon
sure would have helped.
No need cryin' about that.
We'll make it up on
that Davies County job.
How much do tax
collections run?
Might amount to $20,000.
This time, we'll
protect ourselves.
We'll send Jason or
Cortright with 'em.
Oh, they ain't
had no experience
In that kind of thing.
Experience doesn't matter.
When the money is counted,
I want somebody there
We can trust.
Think you'll ever find
anybody you can trust?
For you, Judge.
That was the
at the bank.
Just come across one
of them $100 bills
From the train robbery.
Serial numbers check.
Where'd he get it?
Wade Fisher's department.
You reckon one of
the Renos spent it?
We're sure going to
find out who spent it.
Sure, I remember.
First $100 bill
I've seen in years.
Noah Euall's nephew spent it.
The one that tangled with
Pete McCartney and Lee Harney?
That's right.
Name's Barlow.
He's a painter.
New fella.
He had to be new to
tangle with those two.
Had a whole handful
of $100 bills.
Something wrong?
Oh no, no.
Just checking.
Did you hear that?
A whole handful of $100 bills?
Something else, too.
He fits the description
of the holdup man.
I'd say he has some
explaining to do.
You fellas better get at it.
I'm getting sick and tired
of you snarling at me.
Well then behave yourself.
You know how I feel about
you taking up with strangers.
I didn't take up with him.
He helped me into the
buggy with my packages.
Well, the boys said you and
him was getting mighty friendly.
Now you understand one thing.
This is my house.
You want to go on using it,
you'd better be careful.
All right.
Let's get back to the
Davies County job.
This time, we're not
all going in at once.
Go in in three lots.
What is it?
Somebody I've
never seen before.
Thank you for bring these back.
Guess those two cooled off
enough to be trusted with 'em.
Besides, gives me a
chance to see you again.
Hold it.
Get inside.
Don't order me around, Frank.
What do you want?
Why, nothing.
I'm just returning
some equipment
That belongs to friends of
Miss Laura's, some pistols.
Drop them.
Now back away.
Who is he?
I'm her brother.
Well, Mister, I must say,
you don't act very neighborly.
Got no cause to be neighborly.
Get off of the
property, and stay off.
Didn't come to see you.
Came to see Miss Laura.
You heard me.
Stop it, Frank.
Stop it.
It's all right, Miss Laura.
Needn't be troubled.
I'll see you someplace else.
When you comin' in town again?
She ain't.
In the morning.
See you then.
You may think
you're spiting me,
But let me tell you something.
Anything goes wrong,
you got just as much
To lose as the rest of us.
Get that through your pretty
little head, will you?
Get one thing through
your head, too.
I'm not a child and I won't be
treated like one any longer.
I hear mice.
Put your hands up.
What's going on here?
You too.
Who are you?
The law.
Anybody else inside that house,
come out with your hands up
Or I'll shoot this coney
for every dime it's got.
Maybe not.
Mind telling us
what the charge is?
Suspicion.
Or worse.
Suspicion of what?
Train robbery.
Train robbery?
Why, you're a bigger
fool than I thought.
All right, boys.
Take him into town.
You can't do this, I tell you.
Most disgraceful
thing I ever heard of.
Who do you fellas
think you are, anyway?
The law, that's who.
Take 'em in.
Six nice clean,
crisp $100 notes.
Shall we, um... shall
we get the judge
And split this between us?
Why, why, um, why not?
Let's have a look inside.
We were coming to Seymour
from Robinson, Illinois.
We saw the crowd
around the money box.
We went down there.
There had been a train robbery.
We found the money.
I guess the robbers dropped it.
For three hours, I've
been telling you that.
And for the three
hours, we've been
Telling you we don't believe it.
I can't help it.
Sit down.
Can I have a drink of water?
No.
The money matches, the
description matches,
Your arrival here matches.
Everything matches.
Coincidence.
Where's the money?
You took it.
I mean the rest of
it, the other $29,000.
Oh, what's the use.
You wouldn't believe me.
Any news?
He won't talk.
How about him?
Nothing.
All right.
On your feet.
Come on.
Where's the money?
Lattimore was asking him
questions, and all of a sudden,
Barlow said, get the judge,
and Lattimore got excited.
Kept saying he was the
prosecuting attorney
And if Barlow had
anything to say,
He was the one to say it to.
Naturally, I'm
the one to talk to.
Lattimore's trying
to hog everything.
He wants to talk to you.
So we're here.
Go ahead and talk.
Hello.
You listen to me.
I'm the prosecuting
attorney here.
Wait outside.
This was my doing.
He never budged until I tried to
get the express messenger down
Here to identify him.
That's what we can do.
Wait outside.
Now what was it
you wanted to say?
Can I have a drink
of water, Judge?
Go ahead.
Do you appreciate irony, Judge?
How's that?
The imponderables?
The little things that
happen to wreck the foolproof
Setup that you can never
figure will happen?
This was a foolproof setup.
I had a contact man in the
express office who told me
When the money would be shipped.
I picked the perfect spot
for the train robbery.
The money box was open just
right, and up to that point,
Everything was perfect.
And then... and then
came the imponderable.
In my hurry to get away,
I dropped a few bills
With serial numbers,
and here I am.
Irony.
Where's the money?
Hidden.
My share, that is.
Your share?
You're in this all by yourself.
No man could do
this by himself.
There were six of us.
Seven, counting the contact man.
Where are they now?
Scattered.
That leaves three here.
Two.
Claxton and me.
Euall had nothing to do with it.
He didn't know about it.
Claxton's share hidden too?
With mine at the Euall farm.
Where at the Euall farm?
You couldn't find it.
I'd have to go with you.
Now, um, you're a
practical man, Judge.
Sure, you can send
Claxton and me to prison,
But it won't get you
a raise in salary
And it won't get you
much of a reward.
And as for me, with a contact
man who knows when the big
Express money shipments
are to be made,
It'll... it'll ruin a
$1 million business.
You say you've got a contact
man in the express office?
JAMES BARLOW
: A big one.
A superintendent.
Which office?
I'm a practical man too, Judge.
How do I know you ain't lying?
You think I held up that train
on the spur of the moment?
How do you think I knew
the money was aboard?
A $1 million business,
but not with me in prison.
We don't get it,
somebody else will.
I don't like the
way you talk, like
The way you handle yourself.
All I need is a little freedom.
It won't be that simple.
Lot of people here
in town know you
Were arrested with
some of that holdup
Money in your possession.
All you've got
to say is I proved
I found it around the money box.
Others did.
And what guarantee have
I got if I turn you loose,
You won't pull out?
The best in the world.
I need you more
than you need me.
This is a safe place to
hole up between operations.
Besides, if I did
pull out, you'd
Still be better off by $3,000.
Hm.
Hm.
Gentlemen, I guess we owe
Mr. Barlow an apology.
He's clean as a hound's tooth.
Wait a minute.
Perhaps you misunderstood me.
Mr. Barlow had nothing to
do with the train robbery.
He found the money.
Oh.
Oh.
That was our opinion, too.
Yeah, clean as a hound's tooth.
Have Cortright
release the other two.
I'm going out to the Euall
farm with Mr. Barlow.
Mind if I go, too?
And me?
Try and stop you.
Oh by the way, um,
did you two gents
Give the judge his share of
the $600 you took from me?
Here you are, your
honor. $30,000.
This is only the beginning.
All right.
So far so good.
Now where do we go from here?
We, um, we have to wait
for news from head office.
Let's hope it
won't be too long.
We hope stronger
than you since we're
The ones who have
been cleaned out.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I'd rather nab those three
than to turn in the Reno boys.
Take it easy, Jim.
One thing at a time.
Was that, um, $2,000 even?
You'll get yours,
Mr. Prosecutor.
You'll get it.
Just askin'.
You know, I'm just thinkin'.
He'd be a good one to send
To Davies County with the Renos
instead of Jason or Cortright.
Maybe.
One thing.
He don't scare easy.
You reckon the Renos
would stand for it?
They'll have to.
We'll make it a court order.
Anything else, Miss Laura?
Oh, yes.
I'd like a side of bacon.
But yesterday you...
I know.
I'd like another side of bacon.
Very well.
Eight and a half
pounds all right?
Fine.
Anything else?
That's all.
Um, here's that, um, article
you asked for, Miss Laura.
Oh, thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.
Goodbye, Miss Laura.
Howdy, Laura.
Oh, Clint.
Um, Mr. Barlow, I'd like you
to meet my brother, Clint.
How are you?
How do you do?
Nice meeting you, Mr. Barlow.
Oh.
Sorry.
It's, um, a book I
borrowed from Mr. Fisher.
Interested in
painters, Miss Laura?
Yes.
Oh.
I don't think you're going
to find me in this edition.
What time shall
we shop tomorrow?
A couple more shopping
days like this and I
Can open my own store.
It's been a genuine
pleasure, Miss Laura.
I agree.
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.
Good day.
You aiming on getting
yourself killed?
Contrary.
I was just planning my future.
I don't like you, Barlow.
Don't like your talk,
but I admire guts.
Judge Hawkins said you are
pretty good at train robbin'.
Fair, I'd say.
Seems to think you're good
enough to ride with the Renos.
That's a compliment.
My partner and I will
consider your invitation.
No partners.
Judge didn't say
nothing about nobody.
Just you.
I see.
Um, when do we go?
Now.
Now?
Um, where?
When you ride with us,
Barlow, don't ask no questions.
Come on.
Stop.
Let's give 'em a .
Isn't that the state
line we just crossed?
Right.
Any harm now in telling
me where we're going?
Up ahead.
How much farther?
You ask too many questions.
What do you mean by that?
Look.
You're along as an extra hand.
You've got nothing to say.
Didn't the judge
make that clear?
Yeah.
All right.
Now I'm making it clear, so
get it through your head.
All right.
We'll split up, circle
around, and go in.
Dobe?
Yeah.
Meet us on Church Hill.
Pick John and Sim up in front
of the surveyor's office.
Come on, John.
Is everything all right?
Tell Frank the courthouse
is no good the front way.
They got to go around the back.
But Frank didn't
plan it that way.
Frank didn't plan to
have the sheriff eating
His dinner across
the street either.
Ah.
See him?
He'll be along.
Pete says we've got to use the
back door of the courthouse.
All right.
Let's go.
Here they are.
Raise your hands up.
On your feet and move over.
We've got men downstairs,
so don't nobody holler.
Over the safe, you.
Hurry up!
Against the wall.
All right, open it up.
Be quick about it!
Ain't much money in here.
I know what's in there.
Now fill that up.
Get your hands a
little higher, neighbor.
You!
Get over there.
Move!
What are you doing?
Throw it out here.
Get out of here.
Hurry!
Too bad your brains
don't match your guts!
Ha.
How much you figure we got?
Plenty.
Nice and clean, if
I do say myself.
We left those boys far behind.
Yeah, but they still got
the telegraph on their side.
This is where we split up.
Every man goes back to
the house his own way.
Roundabout, too.
Move out!
I reckon you didn't
hear me right.
I said this is
where we split up.
I don't know this country.
Well, go with one of them.
I'm going with
you, seeing as how
You're the one
that's got the money.
$21,220.
Well, split between 10 of
us, that's $2,122 apiece.
That don't seem like very much.
Could've been more.
Why wasn't it, then?
Ask him.
Everything was
going fine until he
Took a shot at
one of the clerks.
If I'd let him get his
hands on that pistol,
He'd have blown
somebody's head off.
Should've put him on the
floor in the first place.
Should've put 'em all on the
floor the moment we went in.
You don't think much of the
way I run things, do you?
No, not very much.
$2,122 apiece for all
this work and risk.
You'd be better off
if you went back to plowing.
MAN : Oh,
you'll get a chance
To see what kind of a
job you'll come up with.
Won't be for chicken feed
like this, you can bet on it.
Count out my share.
I want to get to bed.
This time, I'll
divide with Claxton,
But next time, he's
got to be in on it.
Good night.
Cold as an icicle.
Mighty big for his britches.
Handled a six gun
real pretty, though.
Real pretty.
You paint a pretty
picture, Mr. Barlow.
I'm sorry if I disappoint
you, Miss Laura,
But as you know in our
business, a little dishonesty
Is necessary now and then.
So you're no better
than the rest of them.
In fact, you're not as good.
At least the Renos don't pretend
to be something they're not.
I'm... I'm flattered
by your interest,
But if you were attracted by
the painter rather than the man,
Maybe it's better
you find out now.
I guess it is.
I don't expect very much of
people, but I believed in you.
I wanted to believe in you.
I wanted so much
to believe in you.
I can't wait any longer.
I got to get a
message to Peterson.
Why don't you wait
'til morning, Monk?
He'll turn up.
Maybe so, Noah, maybe not.
He might have been
sidetracked from his business.
You know, I was warned about
his fondness for women.
You better get a horse saddled.
As you say.
Somebody's coming.
That's funny.
Going around the back.
- Good evening, gents.
- Hi.
How are you, Jim?
Noah, I want you to get a
letter started on its way
To Peterson.
I'll saddle up right away.
Where have you been, Jim?
What happened?
Several interesting
things, Monk.
Several interesting things.
Letter from Barlow, Dad.
Good.
Hm.
He's making progress.
Wants me to meet him
at the sheriff's office
In North Vernon as
quickly as possible.
Oh?
Get word to our field man that
I'll be there Friday night.
You best make it
Saturday night.
May take a little while
to find Hyronemus.
He's always on the
move, you know.
Oh, Saturday, then.
Hyronemus.
What a name.
Yeah.
Howdy, Noah.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Selling anything new?
No, but the old
stuff's gettin' better.
I want you to meet my boys.
Jim, Monk, come here.
This is my nephew, Jim Barlow.
Happy to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Barlow.
Howdy.
Monk Claxton.
Acquaintance, Mr. Claxton.
What are you doing
back in this territory?
Oh, I got a fine line of
enamelware, stewin' pots
And side dishes.
It's all right.
You can talk now.
We're by ourselves.
In my business, friend,
caution becomes a habit.
Barlow, Mr. Peterson wants
to meet you Saturday night.
Where?
Sheriff Mosley's
office in North Vernon.
I'll be there.
That's probably Barlow.
Hello, Peterson.
Glad you could make it.
Good to see you, Jim.
Sheriff Mosley.
Sheriff.
Howdy, Barlow.
Deputy Bonner.
Howdy.
Howdy.
I was beginning
to worry about you.
Did a little worrying myself.
How's Monk?
Oh, just fine.
Just fine.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Now gentlemen,
here's the layout.
I got the  all
primed for a big haul.
All that's necessary
is to bait the trap,
But we must bait it well.
Hm, it's a telegram.
Indianapolis.
James Barlow, Seymour, Indiana.
Based on yield this
year, next corn crop
Should reach 100,000 bushels and
we'll need your help to farm.
Aunt Mary leaves here Friday
the 11th on train 58 on her way
To Louisville.
Try to see her for
a moment at Seymour.
What does this mean?
That's from the
contact man of the home
Office of the express company.
Oh.
It means train 58 leading
Indianapolis for Louisville
This coming Friday will
be carrying $100,000.
$100,000?
So that's it.
$100,000.
It's the answer to everything.
Means we can go to California.
Now, gentlemen.
I... I wouldn't be
buying my tickets yet.
Remember, Friday's
only three days off.
That won't give me enough
time to get my men together.
Claxton and I can't
handle this by ourselves.
You got the Reno boys.
I don't get along with
that clodhopper's crew.
They done good so far.
Reputation, yes, but
they're still clodhoppers.
This is a big job.
It has to be handled right.
Otherwise, I'd rather pass
it up and wait for another.
But when will that be?
I don't know.
What if the Renos followed
your orders on this?
You know how they feel.
Frank wants to run everything.
But suppose he lets you run it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You understand,
they're my instructions.
I won't have any
arguments from anyone.
Over that kind of money, we can
afford to let you run things.
There can't be any
hit or miss about this.
We'll meet at the Euall
farm at 5:00 in the morning.
I'll be waiting.
I'll be waiting.
I'll blow the top
of his head off.
After we get the money.
Hello, Clint.
Barlow, I got to talk to you.
What about?
Laura.
I want you to get her away
from here before it's too late.
I've tried to get
her away myself,
Even offered to leave
the county with her,
But she's loyal to my brothers.
I don't know that I could
do anything about it.
You could break her loose.
That's what you
could do about it.
My brothers are no good.
They're destroying themselves.
They're destroying
Laura, and maybe you too,
If you don't get away.
But I, um...
She's worth saving, Mr. Barlow.
Believe me, she's worth saving.
Take her away.
She'll go with you.
She's in love with you.
Seems to me this
is something she
Should say for herself, Clint.
What time is it?
I don't know, but it's
getting mighty late.
Here they come.
Let's get ready, boys.
She's coming around the bend.
Jake, take your men around
the other end of the train,
And be quiet.
Come with me.
Engineer.
Stop the train!
Open up or we'll blow it up.
MAN : Come on!
All right.
Open.
Bring out the cash box.
Drop your guns.
You're surrounded.
That no good Barlow's an agent.
Lee!
Get Claxton!
I can't.
I'm hit!
Sim, I got Lee.
Well, he never
could shoot anyway.
Sim, on your right.
Pete!
Claxton.
get that Barlow.
Look out, Barlow.
Throw that gun over here!
All right.
Come out of there.
Hands up.
Come on!
Sim!
Sim, look.
They... they got Frank.
All right, they got him.
Shut up!
No.
They ain't going to chance it.
I'm going to give up.
You're what?
Don't shoot.
I give up.
Come back here, you rat!
Take him into town, boys.
Go on.
Why didn't you let me
shoot the yellow belly?
We're saving him and you.
All right.
Take 'em off.
Come on.
Mosley, did you get the
man with the horses?
We got the lot.
Poor Claxton.
He didn't know how
right he was when
He called this a
calculated risk.
We lost a good man, Peterson.
You'll get what you deserve.
You people don't
know what .
We'll show you.
Who has the authority?
This is imponderable.
And they may get loose.
They may indeed.
Nobody knows what
the Renos can do.
We simply cannot take any
more chance with them,
Not only for our own sakes,
but for the sake of the whole
State.
All around us, other
counties are decent
And God fearing while
we have been notorious.
This is not my idea.
This is the idea of
the majority of you.
None of us is excited
None of us is hot headed.
This is something that
has to be done, and done
With as little compulsion as
you would kill a rattlesnake.
Anybody got anything to say?
As long as the
Renos are left alive,
There's always the threat that
we'll be terrorized again.
I say the time has
come for us to make
Sure we can live the rest of
our lives in peace and quiet.
And to take some of the
shame off Jackson County.
Anything else?
MAN :
We've talked enough.
Let's get the job done.
It's now 11 o'clock.
We'll leave right away.
That should put us there by
Come armed and with masks.
Come out of there.
Come on.
Laura.
It had to happen whether they
were your brothers or mine.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
the real truth about myself.
Oh, oh, oh Jim.
NOAH :
Who's in there?
It's all right, Noah.
NOAH : You Jim?
JIM : Yeah.
Sounded like you were trying
to get yourself some night owls.
What's going on here?
Oh.
Who is it?
Clint, Mr. Euall.
Where's Barlow?
He's here.
Where?
Oh.
Mr. Barlow, Laura.
They're after Frank
and the others.
Oh.
Fisher and the mob.
They're headed for North Vernon.
Look after Laura.
Oh.
On Clint, what happened?
Fisher, Dedrick and
Foley are the leaders.
They've stirred
up the whole town.
Don't move.
Raise your hands, Sheriff.
Stand up.
Don't reach for your gun.
What do you want?
We want the Reno brothers.
You men got no...
Give us the keys.
MAN :
Give us the keys.
Simmy.
You hear that?
MAN : We
want the Reno brothers.
Yeah, yeah.
I heard 'em.
You men no right to...
Give us the keys.
MAN : Why you
guys wearing masks, anyway?
MAN :
That's far enough.
That's far enough.
Hurry up.
We haven't got all night.
Which way?
There.
All right.
Take 'em out.
All right, boys.
Do, you can't.
Frank!
Frank!
This one next, .
No!
You've got to give us a trial.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Shut up and stop begging
like a yellow belly.
All right.
Drag him out of there.
I ain't forgot how to walk.
Get your hands off of me.
You keep out of this, Barlow.
You're breaking the law.
I'm going in.
We're the law now.
You're a mob.
We're the citizens and we're
going through with this.
.
Shut up!
You're making me sick.
Frank!
Get away from those ropes.
Too late, Barlow.
You want law and order.
Is this the way to
get it with a mob?
The Renos are going to be
tried, tried legal and proper.
They're going to be hanged now.
Step...
Drop that gun, Barlow.
Get on with it.
I know you Fisher,
and you, Dedrick.
If you hang these men...
All right, Fisher.
Who were the others?
Dedrick, who were they?
I don't like lynchers much
better than I like outlaws.
Put 'em in the Reno cells.
It was worth it.
After a few years
behind the bars,
Maybe you'll change your tune.
Mighty good shooting, Barlow.
Sorry, fella.
Didn't do much good after all.
Ooh.
You shouldn't have come here.
I had to.
I'm sorry, Laura.
I tried.
I know.
