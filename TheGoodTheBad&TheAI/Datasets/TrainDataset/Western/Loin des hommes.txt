ALGERIA 1954
Well?
Why do we make history
begin in the year 3000 BC?
What first appears at that time?
You know this.
We've studied it before.
- Salma?
- Tools.
No, we already learned
that's the start of prehistory.
Two million years ago.
Yacine?
Writing.
Very good, Yacine.
The invention of writing. In Mesopotamia.
And also...
Children! Pay attention!
And also, at the same
time, near here in Egypt.
The Garonne...
The Rhine...
The Loire...
Just a second.
- You rode up here by horse?
- The road's blocked off.
You're armed?
What's wrong?
There were over twenty attacks
in the past two days.
At the barracks in Berzina.
The sentries had their throats slit.
And up in the Aurès mountains
they killed a teacher.
Hand out the grain and leave.
Come back to Tinguit with us
until it blows over.
We're all in the same boat.
I don't think so.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Here, Madjid.
Help yourself.
Two hours from El Ameur to here.
Filthy weather, filthy times.
- Can we untie him for the tea?
- Yes, of course.
I wouldn't mind some of your stronger stuff.
Where are you heading?
Here.
Here?
- Sleeping here?
- No, I'm off back to El Ameur.
He's staying here.
You have to deliver him to Tinguit.
- He's wanted.
- What?
Those are orders.
I'm a teacher, Balducci.
We can't do it. We need
our people to patrol the region.
It's getting worse by the day.
You're tough. You'll be back
to teaching in two days.
I'm sorry, but we have no choice.
- Is he a rebel?
- No, I don't think so.
But, you can never know for sure.
- What has he done?
- He killed a man.
- Who?
- His cousin.
A theft, I think.
Stolen wheat...
In any case, he killed his cousin.
Sliced his throat with a billhook.
Like a sheep.
- Does he speak French?
- Not a word.
You're a good man, Balducci, but...
I'm not going to do that.
Do what?
Take a man to his death.
- His trial.
- It's the same thing.
It's simple, Balducci.
I'm not doing it.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
Do you have a weapon?
I don't need two.
I'm not doing it,
I already told you.
My orders were to bring him here.
Now it's up to you.
You have to keep him here tonight.
Come on...
No, there's no need.
As you want.
One word of advice...
Take him there,
or they'll give you trouble.
They don't like you.
And they'd love to shut down your school
without any French children.
See you.
Come here.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
Here.
Take this.
Drink.
Lay this on your forehead.
Thank you.
You speak French?
Yes, a little.
I worked on the French farm.
I don't want to talk to the police.
I'm glad you're taking me.
I'm not taking you anywhere
Tomorrow, you're leaving.
Anyone there?
Who is it?
Is someone there?
Wake up!
Come on.
Sit over there.
- What do you want?
- We're from his village.
Let him leave.
- Why do you want him?
- What's it to you?
Do you want to go?
Go on! You're free.
- Go!
- No, I don't want to.
Give him to us!
Go away! This is a school.
Leave now!
He's armed!
Don't make me hurt you.
Go away!
We'll be back for you!
You're leaving.
You have to be gone,
before they come back.
Go, damnit!
Go!
Go on!
Walk!
You understand?
Get lost!
Say something.
Aren't you a man?
If I go, I'm a dead man.
If you stay here you'll be as well.
- Take me to Tinguit.
- No.
It's that way, south.
A day away.
Just follow the track.
Wait!
Come here.
Taking me to Tinguit?
You know what you risk there?
Do you understand?
You'll be taken to court.
You know what awaits you?
Eat.
And drink.
Children, there will be
no class today
Hey, you!
Hi, Francis.
René...
Did Balducci bring him here?
Yes.
René's herd was slaughtered.
What has he done?
Why?
We'll take care of him for you.
He didn't slaughter your cattle.
He killed his cousin.
He's the only prisoner.
Leave him to us.
I'm sorry for you, René
But it wasn't him.
- You don't care!
- I do.
- Afraid to upset your friends?
- It wasn't him, ok?!
You don't get it, Daru.
Hand him over.
Calm down, René.
Do as we say, damn it!
Why do you care?
- Lower the rifle.
- Shut up, Daru!
Damn, René. You're
making me do this.
And now you listen!
He killed his cousin.
What village?
Jizer.
Go and check.
Francis...
here.
Now, go.
He'll catch up.
Go!
I'm sorry about your herd, really.
Speed up.
They're coming.
We can't stay on the track.
We'll head to the mountains.
- Lower the rifle. I won't hurt you.
- No, lower yours.
You're not my enemy.
Lower it and go on your way.
It's your fault, you hear?
He died because you're weak!
You have no courage.
You hear?
No honour!
Take his rifle.
And his magazines.
No, you keep it.
It's not true that I have no courage.
Or honour.
We have to return to the abandoned village.
We came that way.
- They might see we're here.
- It's either that or die of cold.
It's condensed milk.
Have a little, it's good.
I'll leave you tomorrow. You're free.
I'll go back to my school.
Is Tinguit far?
I can't believe you, damn it!
Give Tinguit a rest.
Stop talking about it.
I'm sorry about all this.
Why did you kill your cousin.
If someone steals my grain.
I die.
My parents die.
My brothers...
Your brothers?
Yes.
They die.
So why are they looking for you?
They know that in your village
if someone steals your grain, you die.
My family...
My family can't pay the
The blood money.
My cousins must take revenge.
That's our custom.
It's the law. You can't escape it.
You can't escape the law?
You want to escape your cousins though.
If my cousin kills me...
My brothers have to get revenge.
They're little.
I'm the oldest son.
I don't want that.
If I escape, vengeance
will strike my brothers.
Getting killed by the French
is my only solution.
You made sure they caught you...
You planned it all.
You're the oldest, so
your name's Mohamed?
Yes.
Do you parents know of your intentions?
That's why I want to go to Tinguit.
Take me to Tinguit.
- Mohamed?
- I'm here.
We have to leave.
Here.
- What is it?
- Yes, green berouaga.
Chew it.
It's not very good.
Bitter...
But it'll make you feel better.
It's like bread.
Almost.
Almost the same.
You don't speak Arabic like a settler.
My parents worked with the Arabs.
Where?
Not far from here.
What did they do?
They aren't my cousins.
There's no one else.
He's my old teacher.
He's protecting me...
He has problems with his people.
He's going to hide me in Tinguit.
What do we do with them?
They come with us.
They can be useful.
Tie them up.
Are they going to kill us?
I don't know.
The French are in Ait Kermane.
The French are coming.
We're going back to Tamazgha.
Slimane?
Slimane!
Daru?
You know him?
Four years together
in the infantry during the war.
The whole Italian campaign.
I can't believe it.
It really is you, the settler.
"Long live the 3rd regiment."
Why are you here, major?
And you?
What are you doing?
We must go.
Come on, we're leaving.
Saddle the horses, hurry.
Promise me you won't escape.
I don't want to tie you up.
And certainly not shoot at you.
So? What's this about a school?
You're teaching little shepherds
children French?
I teach them to read.
"Our ancestors, the Gauls..."
You distribute grain as well?
Yes, I distribute grain as well.
They must like you on the Plateau.
I hope so, why?
You're doing charitable work.
That's what its called, right?
I teach them to read.
And him. Why are you taking care of him.
He was entrusted to me.
- What'll you do with him?
- I don't know.
I never thought I'd see this again... War.
- Do you have kids?
- No, I have pupils.
Have you been a teacher for long?
Since the war.
- You're happy up there?
- Yes.
Hello, major.
Hello, Madjer!
- How are you doing?
- Good.
- And how's your brother?
- Fine, as well.
Excuse me, sir.
Nearly every Algerian from our unit
is in the Rebellion now.
Madjer, for example.
Joined after the Setif
massacre happened.
You're on the wrong side this time.
I'm not against independence.
Then, join us and fight.
I'm fighting in my own way,
by educating my pupils.
So they can read.
It's takes a lot more than reading.
- We're throwing you out.
- "You"?
It's war. You have to pick a side.
What side?
I was born a few kilometer away,
my parents are buried here.
I can't live anywhere else.
Daru, I love you like a brother.
But if I have to kill you, I will.
I'll die without knowing
what it's like to make love to a woman.
You've never been with a woman?
No.
Really?
I couldn't get married.
I can't help you with that.
What's it like?
- What?
- Making love to a woman?
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
It's...
It's something...
I'd have liked to get married.
Are you married?
Yes, I was married.
You got married in Tinguit?
No.
In Algiers.
At Notre Dame d'Afrique.
- You ever been to Algiers?
- No.
It's a beautiful spot...
Uptown.
A large church with a square in front.
It overlooks the bay of Algiers.
It was windy that day.
A wind from the sea.
It was a beautiful wedding.
You're not married anymore?
I lost my wife ten years ago.
May she rest in peace.
Yes.
We have a hostage.
Continue fire and we'll shoot him!
Come any closer and we'll kill him!
Show yourself.
Walk to the entrance
of the cave and come back.
Go on!
One step too far and we'll kill you!
Are there many of them?
I couldn't see.
Hands on your heads.
We won't hurt you.
Back off or we'll kill him.
Back off to the bottom of the hill.
Are you ok? Are you wounded?
There's another exit at the back.
Don't shoot!
We surrender.
Hands on your heads!
I'm the hostage!
Don't shoot.
I'm the hostage.
He's with me.
He's not a rebel!
Hands on your head!
Search them.
They're clean.
Cease fire!
Step forwards.
- You killed surrendering soldiers.
- They're not soldiers.
Come with me.
If the rebels win,
where will you hide?
Lieutenant Le Tallec.
I'm told you're a reserve officer.
Yes.
A major, right?
Am I free?
We checked.
You were given a prisoner, Tuesday.
Is that right?
That's right.
We thought you were dead.
We're going north.
Continuing the clean-up.
Go to Berzina. That area has been secured.
We have a base camp, one hour away.
Follow the trail, they're
waiting for you there.
Or wait for us here.
We found this on him.
It's truly bad when veterans turn against you.
You killed men who were surrendering.
That's a war crime.
I obey orders.
We must eliminate
all terrorist on the Plateau.
Take no prisoners, none.
Is this yours?
You shouldn't have shot.
We'll be heading down that way.
That's fine with me.
Platoon, let's march!
You want this to happen to you?
You'll surrender to them?
You're alive.
We're lucky to be alive!
Your brothers may be dead
or gone but you're alive!
Alive!
Alive! You understand?
Do you shout at your class like that?
No.
Well...
A little.
Now and then.
Where are we?
Berzina.
Why?
You'll see.
You know it?
I was born down there.
My parents worked in the valley.
And over there.
Me too, as a child.
Over there?
In the vineyards,
and for the  harvest.
I've never seen French people harvest halfah.
No, they were Spanish.
From Andalusia.
, they called us.
The snails.
It's home on it's back.
For the French we were Arabs.
And now, for the Arabs we are French.
Hello.
It's closed. We open in two hours.
Señorita Martínez?
Yes. Do I know you?
- Yes.
- I don't remember.
It's been...
about thirty years.
Ancient history.
For him too?
Yes, please.
This is Mohamed.
- Hello, Mohamed.
- Hello, ma'am.
And...
a girl for him.
This is all I have.
Can I leave you my rifle, and pay
the rest when I come back?
You're coming back?
Yes.
Give me the rifle.
- It's a good one.
- Yes.
Mohamed.
Give me your hand.
Don't worry, I retired long ago.
Raphaëlle!
There's a man here for you.
Come.
Coming?
No. Thank you.
Yes, come on!
- I'm out of money.
- It's already paid for.
Paid for?
It's been so long...
Alright, we're going to Tinguit.
As planned.
Or not?
Are we near Tinguit now?
Yes.
Here...
This is for you.
I found it myself.
I was eight.
It will bring you luck.
An Arab coin?
Keep it.
Thank you, Mohamed.
That's Tinguit.
The large building on the left
is the police station.
And that's the trail leading into the desert.
A day's walk from here
and you'll see the first nomads.
They'll welcome you with open arms.
That's their law.
I can't.
Listen to me, Mohamed.
After that you can do what you want.
If you go to the desert.
I'll say I handed you over to the army...
and that they killed you.
There'll be no more revenge.
But you'll live.
You have my word.
I can't.
Here.
You'll be able to last a few days.
Mohamed...
Don't surrender.
But...
If you say you handed me
over they'll come for you.
That's my problem.
What's the matter?
Leave, and don't come back.
Ever.
Can I call you "Daru"?
Good luck, Daru.
Trust in the Creator.
He will be there for you.
Give to Him.
He will give to you.
Alright, time for class.
- Hello, Meriem.
- Hello, sir.
Hello, Madjid.
Hello, Omar.
- Hello, children.
- Hello, sir.
This is my last day with this class.
I have to leave.
You know that.
I'd like this to be a normal school day.
And I'm very proud...
to be your teacher.
