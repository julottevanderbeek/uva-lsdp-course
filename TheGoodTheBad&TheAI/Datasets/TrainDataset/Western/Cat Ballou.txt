Conductor: Sumpqua!
Sumpqua!
All out for sumpqua.
All aboard.
Here you stand,
Catherine, on the
threshold of life.
You have graduated
from my academy
With a first-rate education.
Ah-ha!
Fully equipped
to deal with the
misery, unhappiness
And stupidity
on every hand.
Remember, teach as
I taught you.
Oh, well, that man
looks clean, at least.
This here man
is in my custody,
And I don't want
nobody near him.
Oh, don't look
at him, Catherine!
Oh, a man of god.
Sir, would you look
after this girl?
Conductor: All aboard!
Oh, Catherine!
You were a good student,
and I know you'll be
a good teacher.
I have to go.
Oh, Mrs. Parker.
All aboard.
Goodbye, darling.
Be a good girl.
Miss Parker
didn't introduce us.
I'm Catherine Ballou.
I'm drunk as a skunk.
I apologize for being in
this disgusting condition.
I assure you,
I'll not inflict myself
on you further.
First time in my life
I ever drank.
I took the pledge
of the A's A at the big
temperance meeting
In Gratzburg, Montana.
You remember that?
Oh, it was a great
outpouring of the spirit,
And I'll not inflict
myself on you any further.
Thank you.
Tennyson.
Spins a good yarn,
does he, Tennyson?
He's a great poet!
Poet?
May I?
"I stepped out of the dark
barroom into the street
"where the sun
beat down unmerciful.
"and bent stood a-hollerin',
"come on out, Kid Shelleen.
"I'm gonna blow you
clear out of Tombstone
and into hell.""
Tennyson's a good poet.
"Kid Shelleen
and the massacre
at Whiskey Slide."
Ma'am, I apologize for
my disgusting condition.
And I assure you,
I will not inflict myself
on you any further.
I wish there was
something I could do.
You're very kind,
but I got here all
the help he'll need.
That's very true.
There are good
things in the bible
for a time like this.
Oh, ain't there.
This berth next,
young lady.
If you'll just step
into the aisle.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry!
I reckon I won't
never see you no more.
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Yeah?
Hallelujah, brother!
I'm here to
comfort the sinner
And return the stray
lamb to the fold.
Let him who's troubled...
You got a match?
Go on.
Eh...
Hallelujah, brother!
I'm here to
comfort the sinner
And return the stray
lamb to the fold.
Let him who's
troubled, let him...
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You was saying?
Eh, uh...
Hallelujah, brother!
I am here to comfort
the sinner and, and...
And all like that.
Now just a
minute, pilgrim.
All right.
Come on in.
My poor fellow,
Are there any particular
verses you'd like to hear?
Ha!
Told you. He's about
as religious as a hog.
There's bound to be
something in here
that can help him.
Keep every Sheriff
easy, move. Eh, uh...
Hands over your head.
Sure glad to see
you, Uncle Jed.
Likewise.
Keep him
covered now.
Yeah.
Open wide.
All right. Come on now!
Handcuff him to the pipe.
Yeah.
Hit him! Hit him!
Will you hit him?
Hold him!
I'll hit him!
Pick up the stuff.
I'll cuff him to the pipe.
Come on!
Let me have one
of them guns.
Didn't you take his?
Didn't you?
I'm worried he's gonna
blast himself free.
Go ahead, jump!
Jump?
Jump!
What happened?
He freed my prisoner.
Who did?
That bible-thumper that
was sitting with the girl.
Conductor: You mean that
young lady in lower five?
Sheriff: Yeah, that's her!
please.
Right here.
Sheriff: Hey, you in there.
Hey, girl!
Conductor:
Come on, miss, wake up!
The Sheriff wants
to talk to you. Come on.
Wake up, wake up.
Parson you was sitting with.
Where he go? Did you see him?
And my prisoner?
Maybe he's in the
next car. Come on!
Oh, I shouldn't
have done that.
Oh, sure you
should, honey.
No question about it
in my mind at all.
It was morally wrong.
But it happened so fast,
I didn't know what to think.
I... I was afraid
he'd hurt you.
That's right,
that's right.
You know, he'd have
blowed my head off.
what are you doing?
Oh, I got a
catarrhal condition.
Well, you're too close.
Scrootch back.
Oh, don't think
I was offering
unwelcome advances.
I put women on
a pedestal. I do.
Further.
I'm smack up against
the side right now.
It's gonna get
mighty uncomfortable.
Well, you're not
gonna be in here
long enough for that.
You gotta get out
of here the moment
it's safe.
Well, that's what
I'm anxious to do.
You think I'd care
to stay any longer
than needed?
Ooh! There are still
people out there.
Darn!
I guess I'll just have
to stay put, then.
Even though it goes
against my very grain.
You take your arm
away this second.
Hmm? Oh.
Listen, I am supposed
to be a school teacher.
I'll scream!
Hey!
I was only gonna see
if the coast is clear.
Gents out there
with shotguns.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
You can't stay here.
Oh, lordy,
I hate shotguns.
Don't you?
I mean, they leave
such an oozy corpse.
But there's one chance
in a 100 I can make it.
I'm gonna take that
chance for your sake.
You being a school
teacher and all.
No, wait!
No, no, no.
I'd rather get cut down
in the prime of my
young manhood
Than risk compromising
a nice girl like you.
Here. If they
get me, though,
I want you should have
my watch and chain.
Oh, this is awful!
Ain't it, though?
You get away!
Well, I just gotta watch
what's going on, don't i?
I'll do the watching.
You get away.
I thought you were lyin'.
You mean, I wasn't?
All right,
let's get this one.
They're searching
the berths.
What's your name
so's I can vote for
you next election?
Catherine Ballou.
Mine's Clay Boone.
Goodbye, Miss Ballou.
Yeah-hoo!
Cat: Papa, what happened?
That corral used
to be full of horses.
Frankie: Well, I got
tired of them horses.
I sold them all off to the
Army at Fort Huckabee,
and good luck to 'em.
But, papa, you spent
as much time raisin'
those horses
As you did raisin' me.
Ah!
And the house!
You haven't had that
painted since I left.
Well, I like it that way,
all gray and weathered
and full of splinters.
Cat: Papa!
Come on, honey.
Well, this here's
my new bronc-buster.
This is my daughter,
Catherine.
Jackson Two-Bears.
Mr. Ballou, what's
the use of saying
to me?
I'm a full
Sioux Indian!
I'm not one of the
chosen people.
All right, go ahead
being stubborn if you wanna.
I ain't stubborn.
Oh, not much, you ain't!
You know, according
to an ex-congressman
of these United States
I heard give
a lecture at the
Chautauqua this winter,
Indians is the
lost tribe of Israel,
but he won't admit it.
Just ain't true!
He was an ex-congressman
of these United States,
I tell ya.
But, papa, maybe
he was mistaken.
Oh, no, he was not.
Jackson's just got
a mean, stubborn
streak in him, is all.
I brought Mr. Bernstein,
the telegraph operator,
Out here from
town last month,
And he stood right
where you're standin' now,
And he talked Hebrew
at Jackson for 10
minutes by my watch.
And Jackson
pretended he didn't
understand a word.
Now, I call
that stubborn.
Well, I didn't
understand a word.
You see what I mean?
Now, you get that trunk
down out of there.
I'll get the satchel.
Jackson. What's happening?
Your old man's got
some roughshod ways.
He's rubbed a lot of people
the wrong way around here.
But he's a sweet old bear.
He wouldn't hurt anybody.
Why, don't you think
I know that?
Why, nobody in this whole
county would give me a job.
As though I was responsible
for what my people done
to General Custer.
I swear, I was a little
baby at the time.
But your daddy,
Well, he gave me
a job right off.
Full wages too.
I guess I respect
and admire him more
than I ever done anybody.
Then tell me
why, Jackson.
This used to be
the best spread
in the whole valley.
Well, the town's got
a big outfit moving in,
to build factories.
Make a real city
of Wolf City.
They want your
daddy's water rights.
He won't sell them.
I'm gonna build us lunch,
catherine, soon as we get
this trunk inside.
Papa, I'm gonna
do the cookin'
now that I'm home.
I'm gonna take care of you.
Frankie Ballou?
Beat it, you.
I didn't mean
to scream, but he
came out of nowhere.
And that nose!
Who is he, papa?
Give me a hand, Jackson.
Papa, who is he?
Jackson:
Tim Strawn, I'll bet ya.
When I say  ,
you don't know nothin'.
Now, suddenly,
you're a mine
of information.
Jackson, who is he?
He's a murderer,
a hired killer. His nose
was bit off in a fight.
If I was gonna be scared,
I'd be scared of the fella
who bit it off, not him.
Papa!
I can take care
of myself, Catherine.
I always have,
and I always will.
So don't let
it bother you.
It don't bother me.
Papa, you've gotta
do somethin' about it.
What we're gonna do,
Catherine, is go on living.
We're gonna eat,
we're gonna sleep,
and we're gonna work.
And tomorrow we're
gonna go celebrate
the fall harvest day.
Take care of the
horses, Jackson.
Mabel, ha-ha!
Hey.
Well!
Well, now,
there's a game
for a Sheriff.
Liar's poker.
We got our unemployed
off the streets
And made Wolf City safe,
all in one brilliant stroke.
They grabbed
Ed Cardigan
for Sheriff.
Oh, he's good.
He's too lazy to steal
And too dumb...
Ballou!
I'll ask you to show
a little respect
for these ladies...
Take off your hat.
You're meetin' my
daughter, Catherine.
Well, I'll be damned.
If it ain't little...
Cardigan, you can talk
to me any way you please.
You're talkin' to my
daughter, so watch
your damn language!
Nice to see you
back in Wolf City,
Miss Ballou.
You got any idea who
forked about a ton of
manure down my well?
Well, no.
well, no.
Some Sheriff.
Come on, Catherine.
Are you really a Sheriff?
Why is it hard
to believe?
Well, why don't you help him?
I think someone's poisoned
that water to drive
him off his ranch.
That's what I think.
Yesterday, a man
named Strawn came
to the house...
Miss Catherine.
There are ramifications
to peace-officing that
you wouldn't understand.
Now, please believe me.
I'm taking care
of it my way.
What ramifications?
Don't you worry
your pretty little
head about it.
You just go right ahead,
and have a good time.
Jackson, am I mad.
I know. I saw
you talking to
Sheriff Cardigan.
Ooh! He...
Just like papa, he pats me
on the head and tells me
to run along.
What am I gonna do?
They got a gunfighter.
You get a gunfighter.
Jackson, there's a funny,
inscrutable look on your face.
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me or not.
Nobody'd bother your daddy
with ol' Wild Bill Hickock
or Bat Masterson around.
Come on, Jackson.
Come on.
Who could I get?
Kid Shelleen.
You mean there really
is a Kid Shelleen?
I thought he
was just in books.
He's real, and he's one
of the best of 'em,
to my way of thinking.
Well, what can I do?
Well, you can,
write him a letter.
I'll mail it.
No call to dance
with Jackson.
No call not to.
He's an Indian!
Scream!
I like Jackson.
You're just gonna make
a lot of trouble for him.
Oh, look who's talking
about trouble.
What are you
doing here?
Looking for you.
But you're
an outlaw.
Sure am.
Got a price
on my head.
Shh!
$25 for Jed,
$35 for me.
I wanna thank you,
ma'am, for all your help
to my nephew and I.
Where you staying?
On the run, ma'am.
Hiding out in the crowd.
Won't inflict myself
on you any further.
Have you
got a gun?
Sure do.
Come home
with me tonight.
Say please.
Please.
Man: Woo-hoo!
You dance so well.
Simple, next to
what we learn
on the reservation.
Buffalo dance,
Rain dance,
War dance.
Is a square dance
anything like a war dance?
This one is.
I wanna talk to you, Lo.
My name isn't Lo.
Wait a minute.
Isn't it?
I thought it was Lo.
The poor Indian.
Well, it's Custer's
last stand all over,
with me in the middle.
Hey!
Come on, you.
Hey, Jackson,
you all right?
Yee-haw! Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Atta girl, Mabel.
One, two and a right.
And a right!
Mabel, my six-foot dove.
Frankie:
My little schoolteacher.
I guess we showed
'em, eh, kitten?
I got north,
you take south.
Yeah.
Where to?
Straight ahead,
on the sofa.
Oh.
Do you think that
pair of freeloaders
is gonna stop strawn?
Well, they're
gunmen, Jackson.
They got a price
on their head.
They told me.
What a fine
place, ma'am.
Nice living room.
Kitchen.
Back of the house.
Bedroom.
You sleep in the barn.
Thank you, ma'am.
Always deeper
in your debt.
Oh, what a good time
I had today.
Hey, you always pucker
before retiring?
Get out of here!
How did you
get in here?
Get... Get out!
Why?
If my father knew
you were here,
he'd kill you.
Oh, you couldn't wake
your father with
a 21-gun salute!
come on in,
we'll play spoon.
You are absolutely
the most...
Well, I guess
I figured wrong.
Where you going?
Back to the barn.
Your father's horse snores,
but I've slept through worse.
Oh, no, don't go.
No! Clay, I gotta talk to you.
Okay.
We'll talk first.
Well, I can't talk with
you sitting right there
on the bed like that.
Try.
Clay, my father's
a wonderful man.
I wonder if you realize that.
Oh, I sure do.
Well, they hate him!
And they're trying to
drive him off this ranch.
They put manure in his well,
and they've made him
talk to lawyers.
And now they've sent a gunman
around to drive him off.
You're dreamin'.
No, he's real.
I saw him.
I'll help you pack.
Oh, I suppose,
to a man like you,
A farm like this
is just dirt.
To him,
it's his whole life!
Let him dig in
and fight like a man.
I'll help you pack.
You are absolutely useless.
Heh, you are
absolutely right.
Oh!
Look, why don't you hire
yourself a gunfighter.
I mean, they got one.
You always make
that little...
Mmm, in the mirror.
Oh no.
Where you going?
The barn?
Don't go!
What now?
Clay, I just don't
believe it when
you say you're...
You're useless
and cynical like that.
I mean, everybody
has to have some
good in him,
No matter how depraved
and cowardly he thinks he is.
You know,
you are a sugarplum.
You better watch out.
Because there are
a lot of people
that are just as
Depraved and cowardly
as they think they are.
And one of them,
one of these days,
Is gonna eat
you right up.
Evening, ma'am.
Air and moonlight
sets the bulls a-talking
to each other for sure.
What do you
want, uncle?
Well, I just
wondered if we was
staying the night.
I'd, uh, take off my boots
before going to sleep.
Jed, I helped
you on the train.
Will you help me now?
Certainly, ma'am, anything.
Stay here with us.
There's somebody
trying to kill my father.
No.
Jed.
Oh, Jed.
We'll stay, ma'am.
Be our pleasure
to do what we can.
We don't need him, then.
Oh, I think you do.
My uncle here
ain't never shot
at a man.
It's against his principles.
Is that true?
Oh, yes, ma'am,
that's true.
But neither has he.
But we'll stay
and do what we can.
Yeah.
As long as there
ain't no trouble.
Kid Shelleen.
Now, come on, now.
You've had a couple
hours to sleep it off.
Let me see what
my daughter laid
out 50 bucks for.
Well, what's
holding you up?
No gun.
All right. Go get it!
I hocked it, I think.
St. Louis?
Frankie: Jeez!
You mean you drank up
the whole 50 bucks
she sent you?
Fifty bucks!
Now, look what
you did to him!
You could've killed him,
giving him 50 bucks' worth
of whiskey all at once.
Fifty bucks!
Papa. How was I supposed
to know he was a drunk?
Go on and shoot, kid.
Bang away, old fella.
You'd like a drink better
than a poke in the eye with
a sharp stob, wouldn't you?
He did it!
He missed the barn.
Sir, you know, if I could
just have one little nip
to steady my hand.
You see, I had
the typhoid real bad.
And I had a rough
trip down here.
And if I could just...
You know, I didn't
get no sleep. If I had
one little nip, you know.
Please.
Jackson.
Yep?
You got that bottle
you always carry to
make that Sheriff mad?
Give him some.
You an Indian,
ain't you?
Yeah.
It's all right.
I ain't got nothing
against Indians.
Yeah, they was
a breed of men
in the old west!
It's all over for
them, just like it is
for the gunfighter.
Except they didn't
give us no reservation
Or teach us how
to weave rugs.
See you later, son.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's all
over in Dodge.
Tombstone too.
Cheyenne, Deadwood,
all gone.
All dead and gone.
Pow!
Why, the last time
I come through Tombstone,
The big excitement
there was about the
new roller-skatin' rink
That they'd laid out
over the O.K. Corral.
I'll tell you something else.
I used to work the Buffalo
Bill Wild West Show
And the Congress
of Rough Riders.
And I rescued many
a stagecoach passenger
From road agents
and drunken Indians
in the nick of time.
Twice a day.
Three times on Saturday.
Whoa-eh!
Where'd it go?
You see a man
with his eyes set,
And his head on a bias,
like, and his teeth
anchored like a mule.
Well, you know, he'd just
as soon hang your guts
on a fence post as say,
"great day," in the morning.
Well, he a gunfighter,
Proud and feared of nothing.
'cause there ain't
nothin' walk on this Earth
he gotta bow down to.
Not a man don't tip his hat.
Not a boy don't know his name.
And ain't no place
he ain't welcome.
'cause when
a gunfighter around,
Trouble just naturally
stay away, huh?
Folks sayin', "hiya, kid.
"how you doin', kid?
"come on in! Have a pitcher
of milk and some gingerbread."
Or "come up on the porch
and cool your heels for a
while. It's hot outside."
Because nobody
don't make no fun
Of a friend of Kid Shelleen.
Miss Ballou! I am here!
I never seen a man
get through a day so fast.
You leave him alone.
Cat, I ain't running
no dude ranch
For misfits
and unemployables.
You keep him
away from me.
Where you gonna
go now, kid?
Why, Miss Ballou,
you paid me $50.
I aim to stay
and earn it.
He can sleep
in the barn, Jackson.
It's my gun.
Hm? Oh.
Say, uh...
Mr. Shelleen?
Hmm?
Okay if I carry
your valise?
Why, sure, kid.
Oh, uh, I ain't
got no cash.
Oh, uh, no need
to tip me, sir.
It's gonna be a pleasure
to see you at work.
How many in
the opposition?
Oh, just one.
Tim Strawn.
Well, waste not, want not.
Where's that jug of yours?
Strawn. You sure?
Yep. Silver nose and all.
Let Shelleen do it.
Oh, Shelleen isn't in
any condition to be...
He sure isn't.
Look, I'm counting
on you, all three of you.
My papa's a stubborn mule,
and he's gonna take chances,
and I can't let him.
You gotta stick with him.
All: Yes, ma'am.
Everywhere he goes,
no matter where.
All right you unemployables.
Now, let's get
the day's work done.
Oh, for the love of Mike!
A drunk in the bunkhouse,
and a circus act
following me around!
You stick with him, now.
Don't let him
out of your sight.
Kid Shelleen don't
have tobacco, does he?
Could set fire to the barn.
No, he's sleeping
it off, poor soul.
Do you mind?
For cryin' up a storm,
what do you boys
think you're doin'?
Cat said stick with you,
and stick it is.
Frankie:
She's crazy, I tell ya.
Always has been.
She sees things.
Her mother was like that.
In the middle of the night,
she seen moon men,
creeping down the walls.
Now, get away!
I could trip on one
of you and get
trampled in the crowd.
Why was I cursed
in my old age
With a nutty daughter
and a bunch of
slack-twisted idiots?
Now, who's here
to threaten me?
You see anyone
over there?
Or there?
Or over that-a-way? Huh?
You see anybody anywhere?
Well, now stand back
and let me breathe!
Drop the gun belts.
No...
No!
No!
You're a murderer!
You're gonna hang.
What is it?
What's wrong?
You killed my father!
Well, that can't be.
He's been sittin'
right there all morning.
No, I saw him.
He hasn't been out
of that rocker all
morning long.
It's a fact.
Why do you say that?
Just telling the truth.
So that's the way
it's gonna be.
better get outta here.
Cat: No!
Wait a minute.
Get her off of him.
Get her outta here!
Just a minute.
Don't you do that!
Put that gun away!
Get that gun
away from her.
You stop it.
You won't make me cry.
You'll never make me cry.
Jackson?
Yeah?
Oh, Jackson.
You're on private
property, ma'am.
You get out of my way!
What have you done to him?
Why is he smiling like that?
Well, that was
hard, little lady.
My father never
smiled like that
in his whole life.
Well, he'll smile
on now forever,
just as you see him.
Free gratis from
the Wolf City
development corporation.
Oh, you slimy rat!
Get out of here! Get out.
Have respect for the dead.
We dug a grave
behind the barn.
We'll stay to make
sure that you leave
before morning.
All right.
You take the ranch.
I don't want it,
now he's gone.
But you tell Wolf City
that before I'm through,
I'm gonna make
Sherman's march
to the sea
Look like a bird walk.
Ma'am?
She ain't got
no place to go, Clay.
We'll take her with us.
Jed: Are you torched?
We can't take her there.
Where?
Hole in the wall.
Hole in the wall.
Ma'am, it...
It ain't no place
for a schoolteacher.
And besides, we don't
even know they'll
take us in.
Of course they'll take us.
It's a place for
outlaws, isn't it?
All you need is
a price on your head,
And you've got that,
haven't you?
We sure do.
Then it's all settled,
and I'm coming with you.
Yee-ow!
Hell, I'm loaded
for a bear.
Let him come.
Anybody wanna try
on Frankie Ballou
Gotta take Kid Shelleen.
Mr. Shelleen,
don't you see
what's going on?
Kid: Oh.
Sam the Shade and Sunrise Kid:
I smell a waterhole!
Hi, honey!
How 'bout a
little bubbly?
Later, sister. Later.
Bartender!
Hello in there!
I want a drink!
What's all the com...
Shelleen!
Think of that, Hedda.
It's Shelleen.
Cassidy.
What happened to you?
Ah, Cavalry, Pinkertons.
The west has changed.
For us, business is lousy.
If we all didn't have
a price on our heads,
We'd get out
of this hole.
Yeah.
Why don't we have a drink
for old time's sake?
"old time's sake?"
Uh, that means you
got no cash.
Nothing to it.
Look,
Hold these
for me till I can
get some money.
Please, Cassidy.
A matched brace
of pistols with
carved pearl handles.
Hell, sentimental
value alone, they're
worth 5,600 apiece.
Them ain't pearl-handled.
And they ain't your guns.
Anyways, no good
no more, kid.
Nobody cares.
Well, uncle,
I guess we're gonna
go back into business.
Remember those fat little
Herefords we looked at
over in Yatrona County?
Anybody for
buyin' a round?
Well, gonna need
more than just
two of us.
Well, what about
you, Jackson?
I mean, you being
an Indian and all.
Uh, you just gonna
go back to livin'
off the land?
You foolin'?
You try livin' out
in these mountains,
Naked, nothin'
but a stone ax.
All right, then.
The three of us.
We'll amble over
to Yatrona County
And help ourselves
to, uh...
Ooh, 50 head.
that's big!
I'll drink to that!
Then it's
all settled.
Wait a minute!
Hold it. Hold it.
You got something
to say about our plan?
Yes. I'm against it.
Ma'am, I can
understand your
objection to rustling,
A girl with your
background and
gentle upbringing,
But it's the only way
we can raise money.
No, it's not.
Well, now, what do you
think we ought to do
That's fittin'
and proper?
Rob a train.
That butcher, Eggers,
over in Dixon,
he'll take 35 head.
He'll take 'em right
on the hoof and
butcher 'em himself.
Well, what about
what I said?
Look at this.
This is the Wolf City
Tribune of two days ago.
Uh, "two hundred
working men
"stand poised and ready
to start working Monday
"on the largest
slaughterhouse this
side of Chicago."
Well, what's that got
to do with a train?
Working men gotta
be paid, don't they?
There's gonna be
a payroll coming through.
I don't know.
Maybe $1000, $2000?
I will drink to that.
Can't hold up no train.
Why not?
Lots of reasons.
Name 'em.
Clay: We're rustlers,
not train robbers.
If people didn't
try something new,
There wouldn't
be hardly any
progress at all.
Look, now,
you're out of
your mind!
Squeeze blood outta
them in your dreams!
Build your life anew, ma'am.
This... This studying
on revenge is just
Turning your back
on the future
And letting the dead
past eat at your heart.
They can't even touch us
in hole in the wall.
We can use Shelleen's
own plan for train robbery.
My plan?
Yeah.
Chapter seven.
"the Whiskey Slide
and Tuskegon Railroad
"had an armored baggage
car that was considered
bandit-proof."
"and to me, that was
a challenge that made it
a matter of pride
"to see that it was
robbed as soon as
I got around to it."
And so on and so on.
That plan.
All right!
You all say you love me
and are beholden to me.
And, and, "take it
easy, Cat. We're gonna
take care of you."
And the first time
I ask you to do one
little thing for me,
Like rob one
little train...
Jed: Now, hold on, ma'am!
Jackson: Listen, Miss Ballou!
Some gang!
Whoa!
A horse-ranch Indian,
a drunken gunfighter,
A sex maniac,
And an uncle.
Ow!
Look out!
Clay: Now, look here.
Ow!
Clay Boone and his gang
of chicken-rustlers.
I'm gonna do it alone!
Hey, did we say no? Ow!
Will ya cut out the cryin'?
We'll do it for ya!
You will?
This is the last thing.
Crazy dame.
That plan?
What in the
blue-eyed world?
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd
about that?
well, I...
I'm looking for
the baggage car.
Well, it's the
other way, man!
And, oh, pull
those drapes.
I'm freezing.
Yes, sir.
Much obliged!
More water,
more water.
Yes, sir.
Here she comes.
Come on. We got
a job to do.
Do we.
My word!
Are you all
right, miss?
Jed: Hey, let me outta here!
What's that?
He's alive!
Uh!
We... We gotta
let him out!
What happened?
Put up your hands!
And keep 'em up.
Kid: Come on, you.
Cat! Cat! Let me in!
Go on, get out!
Who's in charge here?
I am.
Well, what's happening?
What's the delay?
This is a
train robbery.
Well, get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.
Oh!
Here's the safe.
Okay, you, open up.
Nope.
Now, come on,
now. Open it.
I got a gun.
Well, you just gonna
have to use it.
What are we gonna do?
I told you this
could happen.
What are we gonna do?
What's wrong?
He won't open the safe.
Says he'd rather die.
Is that right, mister?
Yeah.
Seven left, 26 right, 14 left.
Ya-hoo!
Oh, this is more than
the $2000 you said.
Nearer 40,
You know, this is
a heap of money.
We take it, they'll
booger us forever.
Oh, listen to him.
Who's afraid of
a little booger?
Aaahh!
Oh!
I give up!
Hand me a towel.
Bah!
Ohh!
Come on, jump.
Jump?
Jump!
Cat: Ya-hoo!
Yee-haw!
Let's get outta here.
Oh, we did it!
My little gang
of sweet outlaws. Oh!
That messenger seemed
like a real nice man.
Oh, Shelleen,
it was a great plan.
Yeah, it worked
just like clockwork.
Are you sure?
I am so proud of you.
Oh, it was just
beginner's luck.
Hey, come on, now.
We gotta get moving.
Yeah, Clay's
right, ma'am.
Ask him if he knows
how we're gonna
get outta here.
You did escape
in that book, didn't ya?
Of course he did.
Oh, you darling,
Shelleen.
We ride out separately
in case they try to track us.
Then we mix up our
trail and meet back
at hole in the wall.
Right!
Yeah.
Come on, boy!
Whuh!
Stupid beast!
Damn!
Cassidy,
cut your throat!
We robbed old number seven,
and you wasn't there.
Drinks!
Drinks on the house.
Hedda, you old heifer.
We got money!
And the train guard,
Hair all over
the six foot five of him,
Kneelin' in front of me
and prayin',
"kid, kid,
please don't kill me!"
Ha-ha!
Everything went
slicker than...
Where are those kids?
They ain't been seen.
Kid, will you
lend me a bullet?
You remember me?
Old...
Old...
Well, I'm tellin' you,
Cassidy.
Them kids are comin'
with the payroll.
It was just
like old times.
Money, money, money
for a rainy day!
Ah, they are here.
Cut your throat, Cassidy!
Come on, help me clear
this table, will ya?
Get it out there.
Yo! Yeah!
Hey, where you two been
together all alone?
Out losin' that posse.
Cat, was he
botherin' you?
No, siree, bob!
His uncle Jed was
right on the job.
Old steel eyes
is jealous.
You got no respect.
Time was I'd take
a pimple like you
And wretch you out
and squeeze.
What is the matter
with you two?
Give the old man
a drink, Mr. Cassidy.
No. And there's more
where that came from.
You mean it?
He really did do it?
We did it,
Mr. Cassidy.
My gang.
Right? And this is
just the beginning.
We're gonna wipe out
Wolf City!
You help me,
and I'll make you rich.
"Wolf City Development.
"property: H. Percival."
She stole their payroll,
Hedda.
Of course.
You ever hear of
Mr. Sir Harry Percival?
He owns
the Wolf City Development,
Which owns Wolf City,
which lets us alone.
We don't bother them
nor Sir Harry Percival,
And they don't bother us.
Sir Harry Percival.
That's the man
I should be after.
You? How you
gonna find him?
You mean
you won't help us?
Cut our own throats?
Hole in the wall's
impregnable.
No such thing.
Takes more trouble
than we've been worth
to dig us out.
Now you made it worthwhile!
Some gang of cutthroats
and murderers.
We used to
whisper your names
when we were kids,
Scared to say
them out loud.
How sad.
You got old.
Count out the shares, Jed.
Give them all drinks
on Cat Ballou.
Yahoo!
Oh!
Some schoolteacher.
Cat Ballou's college
of bust 'em in the nose!
What was that for?
I think we'll
go to St. Louis.
St. Louis?
Yeah, St. Louis.
City on the Missouri.
Railhead of the Santa Fe,
jump off of the Oregon Trail.
Produces beef, beer, shoes,
and, uh, some good times.
But why?
Well, we got their money.
What's the sense of
hanging around till they
come looking for it?
But, Clay, we've got them
where we want them.
They're desperate.
They're desperate?
Let's go to St. Louis.
Clay, I...
I think I love you.
There you go,
all serious
all of a sudden.
You know, you're like
all the rest of them,
You gotta be in love
with some guy.
Now, come on, let's...
Don't be so serious!
You know, you're not anything
like you think you are.
Oh, no?
How's that?
Cowardy Custard.
Oh, you're selfish
and a little stupid,
But you're not
cowardly at all.
Ha. Well, I mean, ah...
Say, when you admire a man,
you just go all out,
don't you?
Love is not blind.
I see all your faults,
and I know
what you're like,
And I don't care,
I love you anyway!
Love, love, love.
I was gonna take you
to St. Louis with me!
Just throw our hats
in the air.
Now I don't know.
Now I see trouble coming,
and not just from them.
Why? Where else
do you see trouble?
Right there.
In those big blue eyes.
Oh, no.
Ain't gonna get
tied down with no girl.
No, I'm going.
You know,
you're gonna get
yourself killed.
Well, what do you care?
My death is hardly gonna
cause a ripple in St. Louis.
Well... I'm leavin'.
I... I never
promised to be
no hero, now, did I?
Well, you're no hero,
so don't worry about it.
You've got no right
to think about me
What you're
thinking about me.
Oh, why don't
you just go?
Bye.
Jackson, what's happening?
It's ghost sickness.
What?
This Indian religion,
see...
We believe what
the gods did when
they made a man crazy
Was they...
Made him fall in love.
Well, that's very
poetic, Jackson.
What does that
have to do with us?
Who is in love?
And with who?
With "whom."
Well, now,
that's another question.
Jackson, what am I
gonna do?
Ain't much
you can do about us.
Reckon I'll see
you later, ma'am.
Jackson, what about you?
You'll stay, won't you?
I, I get a kick out of
being on the winning side
for a change.
Sir Harry wants
his money and fast.
If you wasn't a girl,
I'd split you
like a chicken.
Jed!
What do you want, Cat?
Oh, Jackson.
That man with
the silver nose was here.
He's gonna kill me.
Strawn.
Jackson.
You know that
valise of mine?
Yeah, kid.
You go find it.
And get a case of
cartridges from Cassidy.
We'll always be here
with you, ma'am.
It'll be all right, Cat.
Everything's gonna be okay.
What's in this, kid?
Want a drink?
No booze.
No?
No.
Sam the Shade and Sunrise Kid:
Hello, kid.
Long time.
Sit down.
Where you been
keeping yourself?
You want a job?
Some money?
Not money
and not a job.
What then?
Oh.
That.
Well, there never was
any love lost between us.
Well?
Well?
I can't.
Why not?
A gunfight.
Ohhh, it was just swell.
Just the way
I figured it'd be.
Even when we was kids,
He's always sneakin'
around behind a barn,
Tryin' to get behind
some kid and back
shoot him.
Well, I know this, see.
So when I walk in,
I gab with him.
I figured I'd call his shot
when I turn my back.
Well, he don't even
believe it was me.
He thinks I'm still
on the booze like
last time in Tombstone.
When was that?
Ten or 12?
My, oh, my.
How that booze
will do your mind.
Fog your mind
so you can't remember
a darn thing.
Oh, it was just fine.
You and Strawn used to
play together when you
were children?
He was my brother.
What?
Like that time
in Tombstone
When he took my guns
away from me,
Made me walk down
the street,
Stripped down to nothing'
but long-handles and my hat.
Well, I took him just
like the dime novel said.
It was just fine.
Kid, your own brother?
Kid Shelleen
and Cat Ballou.
Old steel eyes really
brought the roof down!
Hold it right there.
You know half of
Wolf City's on the way
up here right now?
We'll take them like
the last time, huh, Cat?
Now they got that
Englishman's goons.
Must be 50 of 'em,
more coming on every train!
The Englishman?
Sir Harry Percival.
Owns Wolf City Development.
He's here himself.
What did they
look like?
Are they professional men
or just barroom sweeps?
Now you just
stop and think,
concentrate.
Because you are
scared and confused.
Big men. A dutchman
from Pennsylvania,
A Polish from Chicago,
Swedes from Dakota.
Hard! You could
roller skate on 'em.
With Strawn dead,
they're nothing but
barroom sweeps.
Strawn wasn't nothing
but a hired hand.
I tell you, this is an army.
And I'm taking you
out of here with me.
No, wait a minute.
Are you sure it's him?
Uh, that Englishman
wants a fight, huh?
We'll give him the biggest
gunfight they ever did see.
Clay: He wants to die!
Look, I've done everything
I ever wanted to.
There's no place
I wanna go back to.
It'll be history.
Kid Shelleen
and Cat Ballou.
You sad old bag of guts.
You're gonna get her
killed, too.
Look, better than
dyin' in some cold,
dirty ol' hotel.
And I was always afeared
of dyin' in the gutter
With a bellyful of
bad booze.
Then Cat came along.
Kid.
There's still places
I want to see, and things
I want to do.
I don't want to die.
Now you're making sense!
Come on, let's go to
St. Louis.
Oh, you don't ever
change, do you?
Not St. Louis?
How about Sioux Falls?
Or any place.
What's the matter?
You afraid someone will
see you with me?
I'll even marry you!
Marry me?
Well, that's what I said.
I mean, if that's
what I gotta do to
save you, I'll do it!
Of all the self-centered,
egotistical things I ever
heard!
Why do men always think
That marriage is
the only thing women have
on their minds?
Why don't you go fight
or wash your socks?
I've been studying on it.
And now
I'm beginning to see.
She loves you. Not me.
Now, come on now,
steel eyes.
And you, all the time,
laughing at me.
Silly old man looking
after that young thing.
Well, bub,
I'm gonna see that you
do the right thing.
Right thing?
Yeah.
Ahhh!
Guns, bottles,
fists, knives, clubs.
All the same to me.
All the same to you?
What are you
talking about?
Marry her!
I'll marry her,
but she said
she don't want me.
Don't listen to her!
Marry her!
Kid! I'm trying to tell you,
she won't marry me.
First, you don't think
you can stand to get hit.
Then you realize
you can take it
Because the blood
don't matter, and you
know you're gonna live.
It's a great gift
I'm gonna give you,
to know it don't hurt.
Fight!
No!
Ah.
Well, I'm gonna straighten
you out once and for all.
Hey, leave him alone.
He's mine.
I'm beating up on him.
He's my kin.
His morals have been
a millstone around
my neck all my life.
Ahhh!
What was that for?
Well, everybody else
was doing it.
I got a right to
share in the fun
Without regard to race,
creed or color
According to
the 14th Amendment.
Can I have my store back,
now that she's going?
What?
It's Cat.
Where's she going?
Sir, a consolation
from the town.
Sir Harry Percival,
I presume?
Really.
Roughing it on
the frontier, delightful.
Oh.
You like our
wide-open spaces?
Ohh...
Positively charming.
Lovely country,
lots of fresh air.
I'm getting frightfully
healthy, you know?
Oh, it's just
simply gorgeous.
Simply gorgeous.
Don't let anybody ever
tell you different.
Oh, look at that.
A painting on the ceiling.
Oh, yes,
that's a Tintoretto.
I'll say it is.
Do you like it?
I think
it's even more gorgeous
Than the girl with
the chairs above
Natalie Paige's Bar,
And that's the most
gorgeous thing I ever saw.
Ohhh.
Ooh!
My name is Trixie.
Oh, Trixie!
Ohhh.
May I offer you something
to drink, Trixie?
What would you like?
Bubbly, if you got.
Champagne, Hansen.
They told me you
had a wine cellar,
But I didn't believe it.
Oh, um, hardly a cellar.
A bin, actually,
in the pantry.
You know, I never
did see a train
like this before.
This is
the master bedroom.
Do you approve?
Oh, it's swell.
Oh.
A regular Tintoretto.
Oh. Do you
like the bed?
Oh, do
I like the bed?
Uh, that will be
all tonight.
A little wine
with music.
Nineteenth century science.
Stone age atmosphere.
Caveman passion!
My wallet is
in the top drawer.
But you'll never get away
with this, Trixie.
My name isn't Trixie,
Sir Harry.
It's Catherine.
And I'm Frankie Ballou's
daughter.
So you're
Cat Ballou, hmm?
Sign this.
What is it?
A confession that
you ordered the hiring
of Tim Strawn,
And are responsible for
the murder of my father.
Sign it!
And if I refuse
to sign it?
I'll kill you.
Now, why do I
doubt that?
Don't you doubt it,
Sir Harry.
But I do.
I don't think you have it
in you, Miss Ballou.
Give me that gun.
Group:
Well, it's time.
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.
Waiting?
Oh. Looking forward to it,
I might say.
I'm sorry
they don't like me.
Well, you can't
blame them, can you?
Killing Sir Harry
put the kibosh
On the whole
slaughterhouse, didn't it?
No jobs. No payroll.
You took the bread
out of half the mouths
of Wolf City.
You haven't got
a friend in the world.
You ready, reverend?
Reverend:
Hallelujah, brothers!
I am here to
comfort the sinner
And return the
stray lamb to the fold.
Let them what's troubled,
Let them what's
vexed of mind, take heart.
There are many good
things that comfort in
the bible, sister.
Indeed, there are.
It's a better world,
we're all bound for.
Where trouble don't
come around, sister.
And earthly care
is forgotten.
And greener pastures
await the tired sinner,
And honey flows
like water.
Kid? Oh, kid,
what a time for you to
fall off the wagon.
Look at your eyes.
What's wrong
with my eyes?
Well, they're red,
bloodshot.
You ought to see them
from my side.
We're counting
on you, kid.
Quiet, please!
Quiet! Quiet!
If you have
any last words,
say them now.
Let's get on with it.
By virtue of
the authority vested in me,
I order this hanging
to proceed.
Thank you, Sheriff.
God bless you!
Go, Jackson! Go!
Yah!
Stop them!
Where's Shelleen?
Sam the Shade:
Sam the Shade and Sunrise Kid:
Woo-hoo!
