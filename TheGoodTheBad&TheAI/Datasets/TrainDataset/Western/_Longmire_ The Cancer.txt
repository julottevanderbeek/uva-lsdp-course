Ohh!
VIC: Walt, hang on.
You're gonna throw your back out.
WALT:
Hello, Ferg! Pull!
Fisherman hooked him.
I sent him home.
- He was pretty rattled.
- Caught him on a Parachute Adams.
They're tied up like a pot roast.
VIC:
Gunshot wounds are in the chest.
Exit wounds are in the back,
through and through.
Likely no slugs.
Well-preserved.
Can't have been in this water too long.
Right, sheriff, since Custer National
Forest is right across the stream...
...I gave the heads-up to the
ranger station. Hope you don't mind.
I didn't tell them
about what happened.
- I just wanted to make sure...
- Ferg, you did your job.
- Morning, Eli.
- Hey, Walt.
- Man. Who are they?
VIC: Not sure.
There's no wallets or ID
on either one of the victims.
ELI: So is there anything I can do to help?
- This is the Flat Lip. What's up-river?
Swiftwater Creek flows right into the
Flat Lip about five klicks north of here.
- Klicks?
- Yeah, you know, klicks.
It's another word for miles.
Actually, klicks are kilometers.
It's army jargon.
You've seen too many war movies,
Ferg.
VIC: Doesn't the Flat Lip river run right
through the res?
So these guys could be Cheyenne.
Keycard. It's probably from a motel.
Is there a name on it?
VIC: That would make life too easy,
wouldn't it?
It's not for the Ritz,
that's for sure.
WALT:
Hold up.
National forest across the stream.
Res up-river. Who owns all this land?
- Well, you are tall.
- Morning. I'm Sheriff Longmire.
- This is Deputy Moretti.
- Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm a little frazzled.
I just got into town.
Is this about permits?
Because my contractor said
he got those permits. I swear.
WALT: No.
- Come in. I'm sorry.
- They're here somewhere.
- It's not about permits.
It's more serious than that.
Well, we're investigating a crime,
Miss?
Ambrose. Lizzie Ambrose.
We recovered two bodies
on your property this morning.
- Took them out of the creek.
- That's awful. That's just awful.
What can I do to help?
- Look at some photos of them?
- Let me get my glasses.
- We need to know if you recognize them.
- Sure. Let me see.
Oh.
Oh.
WALT: Sure you're okay?
LIZZIE: Yeah, I don't know what happened.
I guess I just hadn't adjusted
to the altitude.
And those pictures...
Should I be scared, sheriff?
I mean, I'm out here all alone now.
You said you didn't recognize
either of the victims.
They weren't on the crew
working on your property?
I don't think so.
- But, like I said, I was away.
- Could you call your contractor...
...get a list of all
who've worked on your house?
Of course. Think one of them
could've been the murderer?
Probably not. Best to be sure.
Now, we're gonna need to speak
to all of them before we leave.
After that,
send them home till we clear this up.
Would you do that for me?
I don't think I could talk to them
right now.
Look at me. I'm still shaking.
Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll make sure they leave you in peace.
Thank you.
Follow up on that
list of names from the contractor.
Take the keycard from the victim,
see if you can't find what hotel it's from.
We need to get these men ID'd.
Is there a problem?
You realize she was flirting
with you, right?
- She fainted.
- It's a classic first move.
You're reading too much into it, Vic.
First she makes a big point of
mentioning that she's alone out here...
...and then she touches your arm?
- Just saying. She's cute. Ask her out.
- Vic, just drop it.
Whatever.
- How did you know I was here?
- I didn't.
I stopped by the Red Pony
and they said you were here.
- Didn't say you were wrecking my house.
- I am fixing your house.
Somebody has to.
- I was gonna get to that this weekend.
- No, you were not.
- So why are you looking for me?
- I need a favor.
That is Freddy White Hawk.
WALT:
You know the other one?
Never seen him before.
How well did you know Freddy?
He was one of the few kids on the res
who had a shot at a real future.
If he wanted it.
Nice kid. Great student.
But?
But I caught him dealing pot
at the Red Pony. And I banned him.
Maybe I should have helped him.
Did Freddy have any family?
His parents died when he was young.
He was raised
by his grandmother, Alma.
They were very close.
Walt, I know it is your job...
...but I would like to notify Alma
of Freddy's death.
Might land easier that way.
MANAGER: Officer, I'm the manager here
and I think you need a warrant...
...for what you're trying to do.
- What are you, a lawyer?
Six hotels, and everybody seems
to think that I need a warrant.
When all I am trying to do is see
if there is a hotel in this county...
...that belongs to this keycard.
Whatever happened to civic pride?
Helping out the police?
Finally.
Now you really do need
a search warrant.
WALT:
You got lucky.
The judge was drinking at the Red Pony.
Here's your warrant.
- Do you smell something?
- Smells like church.
Sheriff's department!
VIC:
Walt.
Holy shit.
Well, we got guns and money.
All we need is lawyers.
BRANCH: So there really was
a double homicide.
I thought you were just trying
to ruin my weekend.
Appreciate you making it in, Branch.
Sorry you had to cut your trip
to Jackson short.
It's fine. We were fighting
the whole time, anyway.
Who's "we"?
Ahem. What's up with this guy?
WALT:
Found it in a victim's motel room.
Yeah, along with a shit-load of ammo
and 238 grand in fifties and hundreds.
- Thought it was just a kid from the res.
- Freddy White Hawk, one of the victims.
The other guy checked
into that motel room, Octavio Mora.
- Paid cash.
VIC: We also found this rental car...
...map of LAX in his hotel room.
So we think Octavio rented a car in L.A.
No sign of it at the motel.
These morons
won't say anything...
...even though I've told them...
Yeah. Uh-huh. No, that's correct.
I'm calling about one of your rental cars.
Don't put me on hold Ag...
Sons of bitches.
Sheriff, I think I found something.
That statue is a saint.
Jesus Malverde.
He's the patron saint of smugglers...
...and he's kind of a big deal
with the Mexican drug cartels.
What the hell's a Mexican drug cartel
doing in Absaroka County?
And how'd a kid from the res end up
floating in the river with him?
Drugs usually mean gangs.
Maybe the res gang started importing
directly from Mexico.
- Was Freddy in a gang?
- I don't know. I know who might.
- Where is he?
- He is in my office.
What are you doing out here?
I am doing what one normally does
at a bar. Drinking.
- So you talked to Freddy's grandma?
- Yes.
- How'd it go?
- You run through the right words.
You think about what to say.
But when you are there...
I know.
Alma would like Freddy's things back,
especially his Saint Christopher medal.
We didn't find anything
like that on him.
She said he always carried it.
Would you look again?
Of course.
This white guy's got a glass jaw.
He's not gonna last long.
- What happened?
- So you know him.
Freddy White Hawk.
What happened?
Shot in the heart. Tied up
to a Mexican drug cartel operative.
They were both floating down-river
from your res.
He must have been in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Was Freddy in a gang?
I'll call their membership office
and see if he's on the roster.
HENRY: Mathias, I just told
Alma White Hawk...
...that her only grandson
was murdered.
That woman does not care about
your pissing match with the sheriff.
She wants to know
what happened to her boy.
If you cannot stand the idea
of cooperating with Walt...
...you think of it as helping her.
I'm trying to find a connection
between Freddy and the Mexican cartel.
- Now was Freddy in a gang?
- Not that I know of.
WALT:
What about the cartel?
- Are they operating on the res?
- They were.
- "Were"?
- Growing marijuana on res land.
About 10,000 plants.
- They were growing it here?
MATHIAS: It's good business.
Plant the supply next to the customer,
cut down on transportation costs.
- When'd you find them?
MATHIAS: A month ago.
Arrested five Mexican migrant workers.
Held them for a week.
But the feds never showed up
to take custody...
...because they were focused
on the border. We had to let them go.
You raided a Mexican cartel grow,
never thought to let me know?
Problem's contained, sheriff.
Next time, I'll send a smoke signal.
WALT: This one of the
Mexicans you released? - No.
This guy, I know him.
Found the same one
in a tent at the grow we raided.
- It was like a little shrine.
- Yeah. He's their patron saint.
MATHIAS:
You wanna hear my theory, sheriff?
Cartels use scouts
to find the best place to hide a grow.
Freddy must have been theirs.
After we raided the grow,
cartel got angry at Freddy, killed him.
For picking a bad spot.
When Cheyenne get into business
with outsiders, never ends well.
JAMIE:
Should have known it was you.
You're the only guy in town who
gets pizza delivered to a mile-marker.
Hi, Jamie.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Thanks.
It was weird.
I saw her right before she went
to Denver and she seemed good.
And then... I don't know.
- It all happened so sudden.
- Yeah.
And, you know...
Thanks for how you helped her
when she was sick.
- That's the business I'm in.
- That's what I wanna talk to you about.
Your business.
What do you need to know?
Did you know Freddy White Hawk?
Why are you asking me
in the past tense?
Oh, no. Was he the Cheyenne kid
they pulled out of the river?
- Not they. Me. So you know him?
- Yeah.
Did you buy marijuana from him?
Do we still have, like,
our old understanding?
- It's just between us.
- I was just making sure. Yeah.
For the last eight or nine months,
I got everything from Freddy.
He was like Weedmart.
He was making some serious coin too.
I don't know where he was getting
his stuff, but it was nice.
It was, like, a relaxed body buzz with an
energetic, yet slightly racy head high.
Why didn't you ever mention Freddy?
Well, you never asked.
That's how it's supposed to work, right?
The cop asks the informant questions.
Freddy ever mention
the Mexican cartel?
Mexican cartel? Here, in Wyoming?
God, have you watched CNN, Walt?
These guys chop dudes' heads off.
God, I'm so screwed.
Jamie, think.
Did Freddy ever mention
any Mexican names?
Yeah, he talked a couple times
on the phone to a guy...
...some dude he called El Lupo.
- You see this man before?
- What'd they do to him?
Oh, God! Oh, I told you!
They're coming for me!
What the hell is happening
to my county?
FERG:
Man...
...I still can't believe
the cartel was growing pot here.
I mean...
...how did we miss that?
We didn't miss it.
It's not the sheriff's fault
that the tribal police didn't tell him.
Maybe not.
But it's a good thing you found
all that Jesus Malverde stuff.
We'd have had no idea to even look
into the Mexicans if it weren't for that.
- That was nice work, Ferg.
- It was just a web search.
- Here they come.
- Let's do this.
Darius, quick. What's 21 minus 17?
- What?
BRANCH: Four.
That's how many years
till you can legally buy beer.
This is a serious offense.
Seven hundred fifty dollar fine,
up to six months in jail.
Come on.
Answer a couple questions.
Maybe we can work something out.
DARIUS: Damn.
- Was he a member of your gang?
Yo, CSI Wyoming,
I don't need a gang.
I got my tribe. That's my gang.
And the only gang Freddy White Hawk
was in was, like, National Honor Society.
Freddy was a major pot dealer.
He was printing money.
I've got to imagine
you guys wouldn't like that.
Maybe you went so far
as to take Freddy out.
If Freddy was dealing,
he wasn't dealing on the res.
- We'd have known. DARIUS: Our
boys even helped tribal police...
...take down a Mexican pot farm
on res land.
Does the name El Lupo mean
anything to you?
Yeah. It's Mexican for wolf.
Actually, it's Italian.
This beer is warm.
Next time, pull from the back.
It's colder.
Mathias used gang members
to raid the cartel grow?
Kind of like what we did in Iraq.
Pay bad guys to fight even worse guys.
Mathias thinks the cartel
was cleaning house after his raid.
Punishing their scout.
But why would the cartel kill
one of their own guys too?
Maybe Freddy and Octavio
double-crossed the cartel somehow.
Cheated them out of money.
Stole product.
Or maybe Mathias
ran the drug trade...
...and the cartel was his competition.
That would explain why Mathias
never informed us about his raid.
If Freddy wasn't working
with Mathias or the gangs...
...he certainly worked with someone.
- El Lupo.
Who's El Lupo?
- Ms. Ambrose, can we help you?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's just, Deputy Moretti
asked for that list from my...
Oh, shit, my contractor,
of all the laborers...
...he's had working on my renovation.
So...
- Next time you can just fax it over.
- I also have something else for you.
Do you have, like, an office?
Yup.
Oh, just there, right in there. Oh, okay.
- Oh, hey. Hi.
FERG: Hi.
LIZZIE: Hey.
- Hi.
Well, look at this.
- I didn't wanna do this in front of them.
- Oh. Heh.
Yeah. I recognize that guy
from his posters.
Running against you
for sheriff, isn't he?
Yeah, Branch.
Anyway, I was impressed with
how you handled things yesterday.
So I wanna write you a check
for your campaign.
- That's not necessary, ma'am. It's...
- It's Lizzie. And I insist.
Anyway, maybe we could get together
one night for a drink or dinner.
I like to stay informed
about the issues.
Well...
Uh, quicker that way.
Ohh. Heh, heh.
It's just... Vic!
Yeah?
It may be funny to you.
I don't appreciate you telling her
to come, trying to set us up.
- I never asked...
- I told you to drop it. I meant drop it.
You think the whole world is flirting.
You ever wonder if it was just you?
- Can I answer my phone?
- Yeah.
Deputy Moretti.
Yeah, no, I would love that information.
Thank you.
Yeah, hey, ahem.
Did that car come with a GPS?
It did?
Heard the chatter on the radio.
- You lost, Philly?
- No.
Just curious
why Octavio Mora's rental car...
...ended up so close to the res.
MATHIAS:
Not on res land.
Boots are standing on
paved national forest.
This road here
runs through your land.
Is the geography lesson over?
I'll check the bushes and garbage cans.
You take the car.
If this isn't your land,
why are you giving us orders?
- There's a security bar on the inside.
WALT: Here, let me try.
Excuse me.
I don't appreciate being
accused of something I didn't do.
- What do you mean?
- I told Lizzie Ambrose to send that list.
I never told her to come by.
Oh. Uh...
- Okay. Well, I...
- Besides, you wouldn't be so angry...
...if there wasn't some
attraction between you.
First, Jesus Malverde.
Now Saint Christopher.
- These guys sure like their saints.
- That belongs to Freddy.
Okay, well, at least now, we can put
Freddy and Octavio together.
They entered the woods alive,
floated out dead.
VIC: After the cartel
got kicked off the res...
...maybe they set up shop
in the national forest?
It's remote. Freddy could've been
looking for a new place to grow pot.
Call the forest service.
Have them poke around.
See if anybody's started farming
out here.
- What are those, surveillance photos?
- I think it's a target list.
MATHIAS:
Nothing.
- You got a problem?
WALT: No, question.
If these murders are about the cartel
seeking vengeance...
...why are you still alive?
- Because I stood up to them.
They know not to mess with me.
You or the gang you paid
to run them off?
By the way, what happened
to all that pot you seized, Mathias?
You think I'm involved
in the drug trade, sheriff?
- Just say it.
- I just did.
So I raided the cartel's grow
just to knock out the competition?
- Is that what you think?
- That's what the cartel thinks.
VIC:
Ahem.
HENRY: So you think Mathias is involved
in these murders?
What do you think? Seem like
something he might be capable of?
I hope not.
But, then again, all men are capable
of killing under the right circumstances.
Yep.
I remember when I could count
the murders in this county on one hand.
Two at most.
Now I got a multibillion-dollar
drug cartel right in my backyard.
To progress.
It's a cancer, Henry.
And you know the thing about cancer.
By the time you find it...
...it's often too late.
CLERK:
Hi.
- Do you have a reservation, sir?
- No.
That's okay. I think we have a room.
- So you're a fisherman?
- Yes.
Okay, can I have a name, sir,
and a credit card?
My name is Octavio Mora.
ELI: I was off-trail an hour ago
and heard this music playing.
I figured it's just hikers goofing off.
But when I got closer,
it smelled like pot.
I didn't wanna get too close,
so I called you.
All right, then, Eli.
Let's follow your nose.
WALT:
Sheriff's Department!
Ammo.
- Looks like it belongs on an AK-47.
- Lovely.
Must've heard me the first time,
hightailed it.
AK's, secret camps.
I came home from Afghanistan
to get away from this.
Ammonium nitrate.
It's good for growing weed
and making bombs.
Homeland Security
requires fertilizer sellers...
...to keep a record of all large sales.
Call all the big farm suppliers
in Absaroka.
See who's been buying fertilizer
in bulk.
The cancer's spreading.
- Who are you?
DELIVERY GUY: I'm Carson.
Someone ordered a pizza, which is
weird since this place sells pizza.
Good pizza.
- Where's Jamie?
- He didn't show up for work.
Jamie, I can't help
unless you call back.
I'm at the Red Pony.
It's my last message.
- Where do you think he is?
- Well, I hope that he's just hiding.
- You hope?
- I'm worried that Mathias or the cartel...
...have got to him, so...
- Okay, I found something.
According to the Internet,
it takes a marijuana plant...
...three months of growth
to reach the height of this plant.
According to the Internet,
the moon landing was faked.
- I am just trying to help.
- I know. I'm sorry.
So three months.
- What does that tell us?
- If Mathias kicked the cartel off the res...
...a month ago
and they set up this new grow...
...these plants would be smaller.
- This grow was active before then.
I know a guy at the Ag school
in Sheridan.
If this plant can tell us anything,
he will know what.
- You can't.
- I have to. I have to help Freddy.
I did not do anything then.
I have to do something now.
No. I mean, you can't walk around
with a four-foot marijuana plant.
It's illegal, remember?
Deputize me.
VIC:
Thank you.
- Where you been?
WALT: Spinning my wheels.
- Where you two going? BRANCH: Well,
we checked on that fertilizer.
None of the big stores made bulk sales
to any large-family, industrial ranches.
They report a series of small purchases
just under the Homeland Security limit...
...all to the same local worker,
"Nomar Vargas."
I had them track down security video
of his last purchase.
VIC: Recognize him?
He works for your girlfriend.
I'm just kidding.
He's on the list
that Lizzie Ambrose brought over.
We're gonna track down
his last known address.
No, Branch,
I need you to find someone.
Man named Jamie DeBell.
I'll go with Vic.
- Who's DeBell?
WALT: Person of interest in this case.
He's either involved in these murders
or he's gonna be our next body.
WALT: Mr. Vargas, why have you been buying
so much fertilizer?
I do all kinds of jobs for people.
Landscaping too.
Been buying a butt-load
for an employer.
We're interested in one in particular,
El Lupo.
Look, Nomar. Nobody will know
you talked to me.
You just tell everyone
you're here about a job.
- I need to know who El Lupo is.
- I swear. I never met him.
I just buy the supplies
and drop them off.
We have receipts
that say you used cash.
- Where'd you get the money?
- From a Cheyenne boy, Freddy.
He would drop off bags of cash to me
from El Lupo.
I would just buy and then drop off
the supplies, es todo.
Where? Show me on a map.
This is the spot.
VIC:
Oh, my God.
Looks like El Lupo
has big expansion plans.
Where the hell do you think
he's growing?
I don't know.
This forest covers 1.2 million acres.
So we better start looking.
See if you can reach Eli.
I tracked these pipes
from that pot farm we found.
Figured they must lead
to a lake or a river.
I mean, if there are more grows out here,
they gotta be irrigated by something.
Huh.
Two different water sources...
...or do you think one of these pipes
leads to another pot grow?
Let's find out. Vic, you go on with Eli.
I'll head up this way.
I can follow a pipe.
You two walk too slow anyway.
Is she single?
- Hello? HENRY: This is Henry.
I am looking for Walt.
Yeah, he's standing
right next to me, actually.
It's for you.
Hello?
Walt, my friend at the Ag school
was able to ID our marijuana strain.
It is called Khyber Kush.
It is a rare strain.
Mexican cartels
would not bother with it.
Apparently, it grows better
at 6000 feet or higher.
The strain originated in the foothills
of southern Afghanistan.
Hello? Did I lose you?
I heard you. Thanks, Henry.
- Everything good?
- Yup.
ELI:
These Mexican cartels.
Now that they've finished screwing up
their own country...
...they gotta come here
and screw up ours.
Only thing is...
...I'm pretty sure the grow we raided
was not the work of a Mexican cartel.
Really? You think it was a res gang?
I'm gonna hit the head.
Res gang would have every incentive
to keep their grow on the res...
...wouldn't they?
Besides, the pot we raided
wasn't from around here.
So where's it from?
Southern Afghanistan.
You know that part of the world, Eli,
don't you?
You said you served over there.
That's right. Four deployments.
So?
You ever run into any grows
over there?
Any Khyber Kush?
How about it...
...El Lupo?
Staging a raid
on one of your own grows.
Trying to throw me off.
That's smart.
Walt, this is crazy.
You're way out of line here.
I saw how much fertilizer
Nomar Vargas was buying...
...I knew there was tons more pot
in these hills.
So you could afford
to sacrifice one grow...
...to make it look like the cartel's work.
But you forgot
the Jesus Malverde statue.
All right.
All right, these grows were mine
but I didn't kill Freddy.
He was my friend.
He was my partner.
Look, he knew customers.
After four tours of wandering around...
...pot farms and poppy fields
in Kandahar...
...I knew how
and where to grow.
Then why is he dead, Eli?
Because Freddy underestimated
the enemy, Walt.
Look, two days ago, Freddy shows up
at one of my grows with a stranger.
Mexican cartel guy Freddy scouted for,
way back.
Freddy thought he could be a partner.
But this bastard...
No, he tries to buy our business.
When I say no...
...this son of a bitch
just shoots Freddy twice in the chest.
Figures I'm just gonna
shit my pants and sell.
Well, after being through what I had...
Well, you just react.
- So you killed him?
- Hell, yes.
There's no way that guy was leaving
there alive after executing Freddy.
You know, Walt, I was sent to war
to kill my country's enemies over there.
Now looks like I'm going to jail
for killing my country's enemies here.
Walt?
Walt?
The only way we get out of here
is you taking these cuffs off...
...and giving me my sidearm back.
We've gotta split up
to take them out, Walt.
I got enough regrets in my life.
Don't make me add this to the list.
WALT:
Don't move!
- You just gonna shoot me in the back?
- I got every right to.
You know
they're gonna keep coming, Walt.
- They're not just gonna give up.
- Neither am I.
Eli, drop the gun!
Where you been, Jamie?
People were worried about you.
- I know. I was worried about me.
- We solved Freddy's murder.
- The guy who killed him is dead.
- That's what your deputy told me.
Branch?
He say anything else?
He wanted to know
how you and I knew each other.
And what'd you say?
I told him we used to play
in the same band.
"Now you owe me dinner."
Signed, "Lizzie."
- Who is Lizzie?
- A registered voter.
You see that Freddy's grandma
gets that?
