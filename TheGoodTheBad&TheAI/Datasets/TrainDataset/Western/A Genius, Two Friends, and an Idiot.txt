God will punish you, Jelly Roll.
You scared
the bejazus out of me.
Well, it ain't smart
to live alone, Tom.
You start seeing
scary shadows.
Red shadows.
God will fry
those savages in hell.
I see them now dragging beasts and
their belongs through the valley.
And I think,
"What a waste of the Promise Land!"
You see here?
These little flags are us.
And all this nothing is them.
Does it make sense to you?
It 's Indian territory.
Back in the olden days of
Spanish Conquest, every Friday...
I used to kill off 12 savages
in memory of the 12 holy apostles.
Those religious traditions
ought to be kept up.
There are hundreds
of frightening Christians...
ready and waiting
for this land to be opened up...
and willing to pay
good prices for it.
Not everybody is as good
a Christian as you are, Tom.
Nowadays, you've got to have
an excuse for killing Indians.
Like Major Cabot had,
when he found out the wells poisoned.
- Oh, yeah!
- We know, sure.
Someway, the Major
didn't put the poison himself.
But he found a lot of Indian beads
gathered around those wells.
If what we need is an excuse, why
don't we cook one up for ourselves?
We get undressed like
those Pagan savages...
and get rid of some white trash
living by himself.
Fast up, Tom. You'd been
chewed fat with Major Cabot.
No, I ain't. Why?
You're saying exactly the same
of he's being saying.
That 's because him and me
are practical people.
- Pioneers the old frontier.
- No.
It 's because you both are made up
of the same clay.
You both got
the evil genius in you.
Good ol' Cabot!
Tell me, you fellows decided
yet who you're gonna scalp?
Tucumcaril!
Tucumcaril!
Hey, Frank!
Bring the ted a cup of coffee.
How funny!
Look it! Look! Look!
Stop it, man!
You are hurting the fleas!
Looked like a rooster dance,
didn't it? Like a rooster.
You're smart to grease that barrel,
if you want some good advise.
- Fall down the sight too.
- Why is that?
Why? 'Cause sooner or later,
strangers around here...
get their guns loaded up their...
- You don't want to get scratched.
- Thanks.
"Thanks"?
Thanks for what?
That 's my name.
Joe Thanks.
I'm impressed.
I really am.
I know you.
- Do you, now?
- Yeah. You're the village idiot.
There's somebody in every town
that gives me that kind of welcome.
You wouldn't talk like that
if I had a gun on me!
I'm looking for a man...
...who can shoot fast.
- How fast?
Well, let 's say,
not a man that shoots first...
but if somebody shoots at him,
he sure doesn't shoot second.
You sound like a hard
fellow to please.
But you might give
Duc Foster a try.
Duc, one of these days...
you're gonna have
to get up from this table...
and gonna out and see
what 's gonna on out there.
Not a thing gonna on there,
never will be.
This town is one
long Sunday afternoon.
Five.
Me too.
And here.
Pass.
Five dollars.
Pass.
Pass.
Ten dollars.
Careful, it 's very hot.
Pass.
Last time I saw my missis,
she was nine months heavy.
For all I know, I've got a family
to take care of by now.
Let me go home, Duc.
I'm waiting for somebody.
Looks like somebody
is already here.
You ain't somebody.
Nobody to all.
- Sorry, Duc.
- For what? Keep going.
No.
- The pack.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Two.
Three.
One.
- Pass.
- Same here.
- Ten, just to keep things going.
- Ten.
Cover with one hundred.
What happens in this game
when the fellow's got 4 cards alike?
What happens is... I'm out.
Same here.
Four aces,
all four in the same hand.
I never saw alike
in all my born days.
Not even when I cheated.
Give this a try, Duc.
Colt Navy, model 86.
All these nice folks are gathered
around. They want to see a duel.
What duel?
Well, you know how these things
work out here in the West.
Two fellows come out
of the saloon...
and stand opposite
to each other.
One of them usually
got his legs spread apart.
And the folks in the town get scared
and go to a save distance.
And somebody starts playing
a funeral march...
on the horn,
on the background.
And then nothing.
Not a sound. Only the
whistling wind from the desert.
Let me tell you the rest.
In a couple of minutes, you're gonna be
one of the deadest men that ever lived.
Outside, my time is precious.
I know, I know,
you are waiting for somebody.
Hey, come on, come on, everyone!
Hey, they're gonna shoot it out!
Duc Foster and the new guy!
Come on! Come on!
They're gonna shoot it out,
everyone! Let 's go!
When you're ready, Duc.
- Your horse, Duc?
- Come and stop acting like a booby.
Mighty pretty animal.
Don't play the clown.
Nobody takes care of you, huh?
- Poor creature was thirsty!
- Next shot 's for you.
Hear me?
Sorry, Duc. You shoot
when you feel like it, huh?
No, Duc.
Did you like the show?
Good. That makes me happy.
If you be so kind, folks, whatever
you can afford. Right in the hat.
Seems fair to me.
Anything you wanna give, for the
fastest gun on the face of Earth.
- Thanks.
- There you go, folks.
See? Even the wind is
on our side.
Watch the hat. Watch the hat.
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.
Remember, folks,
you've just seen a risky show.
I mean,
that is for Duc Foster.
Whatever you can afford.
I really appreciated it.
Ah, thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, that 's Tucumcaril!
- This is for your collaboration.
- That 's the cavalry coach!
Bring these horses and take them
to the stables. Give them water.
After they're ready,
you can have some fun.
Right, sir.
The Wild West.
Oh, boy!
Forgive the reception, sir.
We've been expecting a group
of young ladies...
to work in the brothel house
and the boys made a mistake.
The mistake was made
when you were elected sheriff.
Don't you see that I'm a Colonel?
For your information, young man...
we are on our way to
Fort Cristobal.
Major Cabot may at least
have sent someone to meet me.
Hey, Duc,
you better pick it up.
Duc, why don't
you just go home?
You've been lucky, friend.
Now I've got a job to do.
So do I.
Come in.
She was just a child.
You hear me? A mere child.
- Who was?
- My sister! You raped her!
You never waited!
You promised to marry her.
- Help...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, let me hear you. I want you
to scream in front of everybody!
- Help!
- You ravished my only little sister!
- The man is a maniac!
- You broke her heart!
- He's not a maniac, he's an ass.
- Hey, what 's up with you?
The beard. The beard!
- Yeah, that 's the key to it all.
- What key?
- The key to the perfect plan.
- Hey, you listen.
This ain't none of your business.
Thanks the good idea, Duc,
but this ain't none of your business.
- What are you doing? Don't push me.
- Come on, like a good boy. Out.
Don't do that!
My balls!
That 's a fascinating hand
you got on you.
- I never saw such a deep life line.
- It 's not a live line, it 's a scar.
I disarmed a man once by
by grabbing his knife blade.
Live line interrupted.
You go from bad to worse, Colonel.
Death lines and ambush by Indians.
Don't try to join Major Cabot.
You'll never get there alive.
You are a maniac too,
aren't you, boy?
A friend of mine's got red
whiskers just like yours, Colonel.
Fake, but you could never tell.
We can send him ahead of
you with your uniform on.
But don't try to go to the fortress
yourself, 'cause you'll get killed.
Lieutenant! Men!
Men! Soldiers! Help!
Keep on washing.
I'm just being followed.
Are you a bandit?
Stop!
You don't look the least like those
ruffians on the wanted posters.
Do they make look like that on
purpose? To frighten the public?
Well...
they're trying to show
the evil that there's inside us.
Stop!
- Kiss me.
- What?
Papa'll send me back to Washington.
I never kissed an outlaw.
When I tell my girlfriends,
they'll die of envy.
Kiss me, or I scream!
Sure.
There was a madman in my room!
And another, a maniac!
They both wanted to kill me!
The both wanted!
Surround the hotel!
Find those men!
- There's a man in her bed!
- There's a man in her bed?
There's a man in her bed!
- Where?
- Right here!
Hey.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, save me.
Just this once,
and I swear I'll never do it again.
He's over there!
Get out! Come on, get out of here!
Dogs, come on, leave me alone!
Come on, get out of here!
My chicken! My poor little chicken!
Come on now! Get out!
Leave me alone! Go on!
My poor little chicken! What are you,
a priest or a chicken thief?
Oh, you horrible robbers!
Go on, get!
Don Felipe, you catholics
keep chickens in your church?
My God,
we caught the wrong man!
We caught the right
chicken farmer.
You chicken thieves!
You'll pay for this! God will damn you!
He can't.
We're working for Him.
You thieves, you chicken thieves!
Oh, my poor chickens!
Come, sons.
Let 's go to the river.
- What kind of place is this?
- It 's a place of worship. Come on.
All aboard, kids.
Keep going. Come on.
They're all beautiful girls,
as you can see.
- Where are you going, friend?
- I'm going over there to see her.
You just wait here
and behave yourself, huh?
Hey, Mike.
How you doin'?
- Get a move on.
- Hey.
Don't miss your connection.
- Two hundred.
- You wanna take a better look?
It 's solid silver
and blessed by a priest.
They used to cut the hands
of church robbers.
Two hundred is my offer.
Bag included.
Carrousel off to paradise
right now.
It isn't a better way
to spend your money.
Come on, you faggots!
Are you for a change
trying to screw me, Madam?
Lucy?
The offer stays
at two hundred.
Take it or leave it.
Lucy!
Lucy, come back!
It 's an order!
On board, gents!
The girls are ready and waiting.
Howdy, Steam Engine.
I've been looking for you.
Now that you found me, it 's buddies
forever and I'll see you around.
Come on,
let 's empty the hall.
Come on.
Now, wait, Bill.
I haven't seen him for ages.
- We haven't hardly said hello.
- You call that say hello?
One more time around,
and you'll be expected.
- What 's wrong with that?
- Don't tease him, Lucy.
- He gets jealous.
- Jealous?
I've got more things on my mind.
I pulled her out of the gutter.
She was a free ride. I washed her,
ironed her, and combed her hair.
I made a lady out of her.
I surrounded her with luxury.
I catered to her every whim.
She cost me
an eye and an ear.
But I already told you,
if you want her, name your price.
I can't do it.
- She's priceless.
- Name your price, Joe.
Please...
name your price.
Don't be surprised, brothers...
and, above all, do not jump
to the wrong conclusions.
I'm here to perform
an act of justice.
There he is. That 's him.
- "Thou art the man."
- Now you are an informer, huh?
You've been touched
by the grace of God.
Isn't that so, my son?
- Admit it, you've been touched.
- I've been touched.
Is it in here, my son?
Check it carefully, Father.
When I found you half dead on the
desert, why didn't I leave you?
'Cause you never
double-cross a friend.
It 's all there.
Thanks be the God.
- Thanks be the Joe.
- Just think of it.
The man before you
was already far away...
free and clear...
when, like Paul
on the road to Damascus...
he was struck by
God's Heavenly light.
Burnt with remorse,
he returned...
his heart heavy with despair
for his vicious, misspent life...
in sin and shame.
- Who's he talking about?
- You.
Me? Why...
But his noble gesture
would have remained unknown...
had it not been for the testimony
of this gold Christian soul.
Father, I only did my duty
as a faithful son of the church.
- Son of a bitch.
- But when the prodigal returns...
there's a rejoicing
in the Heavens above.
Stop singing!
This is an honest house!
- Thank you.
- We don't make fun of the church.
Joe!
Joe!
- Where the hell is he taking us?
- Keep counting!
Where was I?
At 315, 32O...
US$ 325 in charity!
That old hag offered
two hundred, you know.
You see, Bill?
Honesty is the best policy.
You're rich and
you've been kissed by a priest.
Disgusting!
Why do you always have to act worse
than you already are?
Yeah, sure. Twinkle Toes
here never pukes, does he?
Yeah, he does.
He doesn't do it in his hat.
He knows enough to do what he has
to do where the decent folks do it.
In the privy.
That 's where
you're wrong, Lucy.
If you spent less time walking
the streets like a gipsy...
and more time sitting
with decent folk on the privy...
you'd have met Joe
before you've met me.
Hey, I've been dreaming
a weird kind of dream.
A ray of the rising sun touches
the tops of the highest mountains...
so they seem to be
bathed in blood.
The peaks throw long shadows
down into the boundless valley.
And in the clear blue sky,
a hawk glides...
wide and easy.
- A whistling wind?
- No.
The wings clipping the air.
What 's that?
That 's horse's lopes.
And now...
from behind the rocks, appears
the figure of a man on a white horse.
He's the ancient ruler
of these lands.
The shadow of a dead king
reaches out for a fleeing man.
His silhouette is dark against
the red circle of the sun...
ringed with the halo
of eagle-feathers like...
...rays of light.
- Oh, yeah?
It 's your old man.
And he's looking for you.
My old man never had feathers.
I'm a white man.
I got a sunburn face,
but you can always tell a white man...
by the color of his ass.
Look!
What 's wrong
with being an Indian?
So your father's got feathers
and your mother was white.
So what? Black, white, red,
what difference does it make?
- We are somebody's children.
- I am the child of a white woman.
She was so white the other girls on
the whorehouse called her the ghost.
I'm not bragging,
I'm just getting the facts straight.
And what I've told you
is all I know.
I'm a lone wolf.
I don't run with the pack.
And do you know why
they call me Steam Engine?
'Cause I got fed up, I jumped the train
and ditched the whole crowd.
That 's right,
ditched the whole tribe.
"Man who gallops
on fire horses."
You got it far enough.
Come on!
Yeah, and you reached the end
of the road, Steam Engine.
- You crazy? You're gonna fight?
- Not me.
We're in the end of the track!
- What 's happening?
- Jump! Jump!
Bill!
Bill, you all right?
Did you get hurt?
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright,
I'm alright, Lucy. I...
Hey, who ever planned
this railway end here?
Maybe they're gonna build a bridge
across the valley with a big town.
I remember this place
when it was nothing.
Is this where
the railway stop?
This here is the end of
the Western Railroad Company.
- That 's right.
- Sure it is.
Those are the tracks we got left.
And where's the Pacific, huh?
- Answer me that.
- He's right. Where is it?
Listen to what
I'm gonna tell you.
There's no future
for railroads in this country.
- And now where are you going?
- We're looking for a new job.
The company left us high and dry
and we're going out of here right now.
Joe, Bill, come on,
there's still some hot coffee.
Here, Joe.
Come on, Bill.
Hey, take it easy, Bill.
Don't go get yourself plastered.
I don't get plastered.
I just get happy.
Oh, come on,
you call that happy?
Indians are gloomy by nature.
Hang on to yourself, Bill.
The son of a chief shouldn't
fly off the hand like that.
Oh, yeah?
If I had a hand full of men...
men that really knew
where their balls are...
I'd screw this whole
goddamned country.
Loneliness.
That 's what it is.
The loneliness of genius.
Thousands dollars.
How much is that again?
That 's the amount
that the Major kept...
instead of turning over
the Indian Agency.
What do I have to do?
- You've been in the army?
- That 's right. Like all white men.
What rank?
Deserter.
- How do you like to be a Colonel?
- That could be nice for a change.
What do you say, Lucy?
I say, where you're
gonna get the uniform?
The uniform is on its way,
but you also are gonna need whiskers.
Whiskers?
Like this?
The Colonel you're standing in
for has a set, only his is real.
Then I grow my own.
Just give me time.
I could give you all the time you want,
you still wouldn't have whiskers.
They don't grow on Indians.
On me, they do,
because I'm not an Indian!
What is it?
Someone is coming.
A wagon or a stage...
I was just showing you what the
stupid redskins do to hear sounds.
They still do.
We have the telegraph and
they throw themselves on the ground.
- Coming this way?
- Who? How do I know?
You believe you can put your ear to
the ground and hear a stagecoach?
- With an escort?
- No, but it 's been followed.
- How many riders?
- Four.
- Indians?
- No, the horses are shot.
There's gunfight,
Joe, they're shooting.
Yeah, I know.
How the Christ can you know if you
don't put your ear to the ground?
Tell me that.
How the hell can you know?
They are shooting at the Colonel
with the red beard.
You see? When you're not an Indian,
you've got to run.
Where are you? There's
the coach and there's the idiot.
But where are the four riders?
Here we are, Steam Engine.
Mortimer.
What do you do
with the beads on?
It 's the fashion, Bill.
But what ain't never
the fashion is witnesses.
Throw down your gun.
I'm sorry, Bill. You shouldn't
have seen what you just saw.
Why?
What did I just see?
You saw the Colonel.
You saw us,
made up in beads.
Oh, you got beads on, huh?
I swear to God
I never even noticed it.
In any case,
you noticed us, didn't you?
Me? No! No!
- Then, who you're talking to?
- Myself.
I always talk to myself.
You know how
prairie folk are like.
I talk and I listen.
Hoping that someone,
somewhere...
will hear and answer me!
For the God's sake, Mortimer.
For the sake of the old days
when we were together, side by side.
Remember?
Mortimer...
Jelly Roll would hate you
for even thinking in such an idea.
Why don't you answer me?
- Let 's cut it short.
- No!
This is joke. No.
Stop! Don't shoot.
- He's my brother.
- Well, Steam Engine...
where did you get
a hold of a sister like her?
Come on,
let 's have a better look.
Be a good girl.
Ring up the curtains.
If you wanna save your brother's
life and make us all happy...
you're gonna have to split
yourself into four.
Stop!
Don't you lay
a hand on my girl!
Christ, how many
are you back there?
Leave out the woman and
the unarmed man, it 's just me.
But I split myself into four,
if that will make you all happy.
Cool off, buster. We're only meant
to have a little fun with your girl.
Why not, Joe?
Why don't have a little fun?
Let 's all have a little fun.
What 's wrong with that?
Why take changes, darling?
There are too many of them.
Throw down your gun.
Throw it down, darling.
- Damn it, I missed!
- Yeah, naturally, he moved.
What do you mean,
naturally?
You learnt to shoot in a circus.
You can't hit but a sitting target.
Yeah, throw it away. You're
better off with a bow and arrow.
I was so scared!
You know, Lucy, keep it up
and I will name my price.
Name it!
- Oh, Bill!
- How come?
How come you go calling him
"darling" and me "brother"?
The true fact is
I can't make up my mind with it.
I don't know each one of you
I love most.
I told you, but you had
to have your own way.
I'm gonna die!
Well, we're sorry as we can be.
- Yeah, it 's real!
- Please...
don't let me die like this
not knowing...
- What, Colonel?
- Why do you all keep...
pulling my beard?
Too bad.
I didn't have time to tell him.
And in a little while, Major Cabot
will know the Colonel is dead.
- That 's ground one.
- Yeah.
Oh, he's beginning
to get the hand of it.
Jesus, he's moving.
He's not heading for Cabot.
He's going to Jelly Roll.
What 's this Jelly Roll like?
Believes in an eye for an eye.
Well, we didn't get all of them,
did we? One got away.
Yeah, but three of them are dead.
So? Everything depends on
how you tell it.
He did it. He killed the three of them,
shot right between the eyes.
But he threw me the gun, Jelly Roll.
I'd never let myself shoot your men.
Hey, keep moving, come on!
Yeah, and you call their attention
with your creamy tights.
I didn't force them
to look, did I?
Too bad you can't hit a moving target.
Poor Steam Engine.
That 's right,
but I was wise to it.
And I got out of the way.
- You see?
- I can hit six out of six!
But you didn't know
that Mortimer was...
wise to it.
No, I didn't.
Where did you go to?
To my right.
That 's what you should have done.
It 's easy to hit a moving target.
Okay, now there's only four of us
to know the Colonel is dead.
It 's a pleasure to do business
with a man who catches on so fast.
What are we gonna do
with Mortimer?
Bury him in a Mexican cemetery.
Your friend's a wise guy, huh?
- You can trust him, he's with me.
- Looks to me like you're with him.
Now let 's see if we can raise
the Colonel from the dead.
Steam Engine,
we are not ordinary people.
We are not ordinary people,
Major Cabot. We're Americans.
The Western Prairies must be firmly
anchored to our great country...
if we're gonna realize
our lovably ideals. How's that?
That would do.
Now the beard.
Jesus!
Well?
Well, well.
With the proper...
trousers and boots...
shoulders...
a little spit and polish
here and there...
- Well, what do you think?
- I think he's fine.
So do I.
Then there's no doubt about it.
They will shoot you.
Say it again, Bill,
keep saying it.
We are not ordinary people,
Major Cabot. We're Americans.
I know you know that. You've been
saying it over. The instructions.
God damn it, I'm fed up to
the teeth with this clowning.
You get to the fort,
you pass yourself off as Pembroke...
and confiscate
the US$ 3OO, OOO. Then what?
Then what? Then if they haven't me
strangled up, I head due East...
as fast as a jack rabbit
to where you're gonna meet.
If Cabot gives me an escort,
you're gonna stop the coach...
shove the gun into my Adam's apple,
and say, "Don't move or I shoot!"
- Go on.
- But if there's no escort...
you don't shove anything at me,
we beat the hell out there...
and live happily forever after
on a beach on the Sandwich Islands.
- That 's fine.
- Perfect. What are you sour about?
That would do, Michelangelo.
What am I so sour about?
Look at him!
You think, for a minute,
he's gonna pass for a cavalry man?
And you think, for a minute,
you're gonna pass for a Colonel?
That 's what I'm saying!
They won't even let us into the fort.
They'll eat us alive!
Too bad for them.
Let 's go.
A wagon without driver.
Who the hell are you
talking to? Me?
A Colonel in the
United States army?
Keep on croaking. Can't
understand a word you're saying.
If what you're saying
is words.
Well, before it withers,
you know what you can do with that.
Hey! Let 's have
a little respect here.
This is the man who sees
beyond the mountains.
And I'm the man who sees right
in front of his nose.
And if an old redskin
can see it too, I'm screwed!
- What the hell was that?
- The Western Railroad Company.
Back on its relentless march to
the sea. Bill, that 's where I get off.
Good luck, Colonel Pembroke.
I'm afraid that plan is too big
for that old Indian.
Hey, Joe. Give old coachman
a hand, will you?
Attention!
Attention!
Colonel.
Welcome to Fort Cristobal, Colonel.
I'm Major Cabot.
- We are not ordinary people, Major.
- Later, daddy.
And this young lady, I presume,
is Miss Pembroke?
Yes, presumably,
she's my daughter.
"Full many a flower is born to blush
unseen and waste...
its sweetness
on the desert air."
Should we go inside?
Major, who did you build
the gallows for?
Oh, that Indian, sir.
