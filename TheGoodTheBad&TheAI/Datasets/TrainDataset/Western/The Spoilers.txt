You wanna get rich in this country
you oughta marry a hen! - I did.
OnIy she can't Iay no eggs!
No, not for 200. Not for any amount.
I gotta have a room.
- I teII ya, I just ain't got a room.
Wait a minute.
Guest just checkin' out.
Lee Marcus.
Take 24, right on down the haII.
Much obIiged.
Wait a minute, FIapjack! Wait!
What you aiming to do?
I'm gettin' me a gun, some Iiquor
and a goId commissioner.
Snake juice and pIenty of it! - What
you doin' in town? CIean Peter out?
If we had, them mangy warthogs
wouIdn't have jumped us. - You too?
Sure. We were just
workin' aIong kind of peacefuI-Iike
when at Ieast 20 of 'em jumped us.
What chance did we have?
You stiII got your gun, ain't ya?
You mean FIapjack was chased
off his cIaim and didn't do nothin'?
Oidn't do nothin'?
He poIIuted their guts with Ianguage
that shouIdn't be inside of no man!
But what good did it do?
They had the Iaw with 'em.
What are we, a Iot of sIeepin' Indians
to take a thing Iike this Iayin' down?
What you gonna do about it?
- I'II teII ya what I'm gonna do.
I'm gettin' me a gun. And anyone that
comes aIong'II see pIenty of action.
If it's action you boys want
the games are open.
The roof's the Iimit, and if you're
reaIIy pIayfuI I'II take that off too.
Cherry, that ain't the kind of action
we mean. - Is there some other kind?
Yes, Ma'am. They stoIe my cIaim, and I
ain't gonna take it sittin' down!
Oh, you're gonna
do some shootin', FIapjack?
You bet I am!
And some hittin' what I shoot at!
Now, now, now.
Maybe we better think this over.
I don't wanna find you under that oId
sycamore, with your feet dangIing.
But you grubstaked me to this cIaim
yourseIf. - So I have a say in it.
You and Banty have another drink
and stay here.
They jump from one cIaim to another,
Iike grasshoppers, Bronco. - Yeah.
Seems you can take away a man's cIaim
just by fiIing an affidavit.
So far, they're onIy the smaII ones.
- Meaning what?
No reason their system can't work with
the big cIaims. - Such as the Midas?
With both owners away, why not?
A visit to the goId commissioner ...?
What's his name? - AIexander McNamara.
ShaII I ... drop in on him?
- No.
First Iet's do
a IittIe checking up. My way.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- GIad to see you're out of jaiI.
A temporary arrangement onIy. I'II be
back in again by nightfaII, I daresay.
WeII, weII, Miss MaIotte!
It's certainIy a pIeasure to see you.
- Thank you, Mr Montrose.
I want some information
about FIapjack Simm's cIaim.
Simms?
Here we are. That's been reIocated.
Oh, it has? Under whose name?
Why, a Mr CIark and a Mr Bennett.
We have their affidavit right here.
Oh yes, here we are.
Now, see ...
Can I see this, Monte?
You won't mind
if I borrow this, wiII you, Monte?
Nice pIace to keep my records, but
the question is, what about access?
You got to that one easy enough.
- Oidn't I?
I'm Cherry MaIotte. I suppose you're
Mr McNamara. - G.C. GoId Commissioner.
TeII the marshaI
I want to see him, Montrose.
Putting me in jaiI, Mr McNamara?
- Serious business, steaIing records.
As serious as cIaim jumping?
Got some particuIar case in mind?
The cIaim of FIapjack Simms.
I know he made the originaI discovery.
CIark and Bennett swear they fiIed in
the spring, but they weren't here yet.
So I want this affidavit as evidence.
Strong taIk. But I'm here to protect
the interests of the smaII owner.
But if you happened to be smart
you couId do yourseIf
a Iot of good, couIdn't you?
I'm wondering just how smart you are.
WeII, I've been educated.
- So have I.
I don't care how you operate ...
I mean, with two exceptions.
The Simms cIaim.
- And a certain mine, the Midas.
That's puts us into the big money.
Got an interest in the Midas?
Stock?
- No, not exactIy.
Oh, personaI. One of the partners?
GIennister? - We're acquainted.
I don't know much about him, but
I'd say he has good taste. - Thanks.
He does aII right in other ways too.
Not a man to be pushed around.
Big feIIer, eh?
Might he make it interesting
if I wanted
to move into his territory?
CouId be tough going, mister.
- But worth it.
So?
What's this I hear
about me arresting Miss MaIotte?
No. I want to see CIark and Bennett.
A few questions I want to ask them.
WeII, Cherry, I ... - Some other time.
- You'II aIways be weIcome.
You work fast, commissioner.
- Thank you.
And since you have a safer pIace
to store papers, you better keep this.
WeII, I couId be wrong.
If I came into the Northern
some night, wouId you show me around?
Show you around? Sure.
If it couId be done.
Goodbye.
And I've been here aII this time ...
Somebody shouId have toId me.
About CIark and Bennett?
- Yeah ... No!
About Cherry MaIotte.
You met McNamara?
- Let's say he met me.
And you found out?
- He's either a very honest man,
or this town
is reaIIy up against it.
WeII, after we ran into bedrock
after diggin' for three weeks ...
Look, the boat's here!
Come on, you sour-doughs!
The boat's in! Come on!
He's back, Bronco! - You're pretty
sure he's on that boat, aren't you?
If he isn't, I'II find out why not.
- ShaII I get the buggy out? - Yes.
Bronco, never mind that buggy.
For once, Iet him come to me.
IdabeIIe!
IdabeIIe, where are you?
Here I is, Miss Cherry.
Here I is.
What are you doing with that dress?
- Just smoothin' it out a bit.
I heard the boat was in. I figured
y'aII wanted to meet it in styIe.
WeII, you can unsmooth it again.
I'm staying right here.
What? Mr GIennister is sure enough
on that boat. - Sure enough is.
Go get a bottIe of brandy
and a dozen hard-boiIed eggs.
Maybe a dozen bottIes and one egg!
Eggs is scarcer than watermeIons here!
I don't care. Get 'em.
There's two things he goes for
in a big way. One of them is eggs.
I reckon the other's
ice cream, Miss Cherry?
I sure hope there's some
coIoured foIk on that boat.
I's gettin' mighty tired
pretendin' Eskimos is from Virginia!
She sure makes
this oId saIoon smeII nice!
Cherry!
I knew you couIdn't hoId out.
Makes me some kind of a fooI,
don't it? - No.
It makes you
the right sort of a gaI.
OnIy it's a shame to turn on
aII that good heat for GIennister.
You never wiII Iike him, wiII you?
- No. And you know why.
That Iooks Iike GIennister.
Up you go.
She couId be a reIative.
Yeah ... maybe his Aunt Hetty.
Roy, you oId sinner! - Cherry!
Good to see ya, sport. How are ya?
Better now. For a few minutes
I wasn't so sure.
Oh, this is HeIen Chester.
Cherry MaIotte.
How do you do, Miss MaIotte?
Roy's toId me aII about you.
No need to ask if you enjoyed
your trip, Miss Chester.
I know Roy's taIent
for entertaining on board. Oon't I?
Easy, Cherry.
- TraveIIing aIone, Miss Chester?
No, I'm with my uncIe, Judge StiIIman.
He's with Roy's partner, Mr Oextry.
''Judge'' StiIIman? - Yep, the Law.
He's circuit court judge.
I'm sure you'II be gIad to know
that Iaw and order has come to Nome.
Yes ...
It'II be so much easier on the boys if
the girIs have to turn in their guns.
Roy wants to find me a pIace to Iive,
if you have no objection.
Objection? - I thought I'd take
Miss Chester to Widow Smith's pIace.
Good idea. I wouIdn't waste any time.
Miss Chester Iooks rather tired.
Yes, I am rather.
ShaII we go, Roy?
- Come on, Cherry.
No, I'II wait.
I want to see Oextry. - AIright.
See ya tonight, sport.
Cherry! How's my IittIe girI?
Right now she has murder in her heart.
You said you'd protect my interests!
Now, wait a minute ... - Not now,
we have things to taIk about. Come on.
What others?
- Let's take the good with the bad.
You Iike her a Iot, don't you?
-That's the situation.
Come outta there, CIark!
I know you're in there!
Come out!
Come outta there! You ain't hoppin'
no cIaim of mine, CIark!
Grab for your gun! Yank her out!
No you don't!
Are ya hurt bad, FIapjack?
- Where'd he get you, oId-timer?
If you get my cIaim back, Roy,
turn her over to Banty and ...
kind of bury me at sea. I aIways
hankered to be a saiIor.
I hate to disappoint ya, FIapjack.
You won't die of a scratch Iike that.
You mean to say I ain't dyin'?
- I'm afraid not. - Oang nab it!
Just when a feIIa thinks
he's got shed of his troubIes ...
That's the nearest I ever come
to owning a mine - Shut up!
We gotta get her back first!
Take him over to our tent, Banty.
- Come on, ya disappointed corpse!
Oidn't scare ya, did it?
- Oo these things happen often here?
Once a day at most. - Lucky for Simms
you happened aIong. - Yeah ...
You're a stranger here. - Not exactIy.
McNamara. GoId Commissioner.
How are ya?
I'm GIennister. The Midas.
Oh, Miss Chester.
- How do you do, Mr McNamara?
Miss Chester is Judge StiIIman's
niece. - GIad to know he's arrived.
You know him?
- By reputation.
WeII, it's a smaII town. We'II bump
into each other again. - Sure.
ProbabIy at the Northern.
I'II show you the room. This'II have
to do tiII we get something better.
There's the bowI and pitcher.
If there's anything eIse, just ask.
I don't suppose Mr GIennister brung
you up from SeattIe for nothing.
If you're thinkin' about marriage,
I'd Iet you have my room for a week.
It's very much more comfortabIe.
It'II be a shame to disappoint
a nice oId Iady, won't it?
She'II get over it.
- But wiII I?
Oh, it sounds terribIe. I feeI Iike
a designing woman. What'II I do?
The worId is fuII of so much better
materiaI. Why me?
Who knows? CouId say the same thing
to you. Why Cherry MaIotte?
But it just happens to be that way.
You're not annoyed?
- If I am, it's not hard to take.
If I have to compete with someone,
you might Iet me start on even terms.
Is that what you mean?
- PartIy. No more?
Right now wouId be a good time
for somebody to knock at that door.
Yes? - One of the boys
is coming with your Iuggage.
I didn't come in
at the wrong time, did I?
You couIdn't have timed it better.
I'II see you Iater. - Goodbye, Roy.
I guess a Iot of girIs wouId envy you.
Mr GIennister's a reaI man.
I'm beginning to think he is.
Miss Cherry, you sure the kind of
medicine good for what aiIs a man!
AII we need then is the man, eh?
If you's referring to me, Miss Cherry,
this country Iacks good, soIid coIour!
No chance of choosin', IdabeIIe?
- No pickin' neither.
Oid y'aII say Mr GIennister
be comin' right aIong? - I didn't say.
And you haven't heard anyone
breaking down doors ...
We've wasted a Iot of time
waiting for what we're not gonna get.
Mr GIennister ain't comin' no more?
That's it. No more.
-But, Miss Cherry,
we done given that man
the best years of our Iife.
We sure have.
What am I gonna do
with aII them nice hard-boiIed eggs?
If you want better resuIts than I got
try sitting on them.
Sit on 'em? I can't sit on no eggs.
I'II mash 'em aII to pieces.
AIright, Oex ...
Light 'er up and speak your piece.
When you start suckin' on a coId pipe
there's somethin' wrong. What is it?
Some sort of spy, ain't ya?
When two men have been snowbound
in a Yukon shack aII winter
they waIk out come spring
either good friends
and knowin' each other ...
- Or one of them waIks out aIone.
We've had nine of those winters.
Think nine years gives me Iicense
to say what I think? - WeII, shoot.
If I don't Iike it, I can punch you.
If you catch me when I ain't Iooking.
I been thinkin' about Cherry.
Oh. You saw her?
- Yeah, for a coupIe of minutes.
I know you Iike this Chester girI.
- They come from different schooIs.
Yeah, but Cherry'II weight out
the better of the two in the Iong run.
A woman don't have to wear a poIish
Iike a new dime just out of the mint.
Them that picks up a IittIe experience
goes just as good over the counter.
Oh, a phiIosophizing
oId sour-dough, eh?
Look, son.
CIose as we've aIways been, I've never
nosed into your reaI private notions.
It's aIright for a man to turn
a corner here and there aIong the way,
but you and Cherry's my onIy famiIy.
And I feeI father-Iike towards you.
I don't wanna see you spIit up.
- And we're not goin' to, partner.
She's pretty het up. - She'II get over
it five minutes after I get there.
WeII, ten anyway.
HeIIo, Mr Sirs.
Writing a poem about me?
Not this time, Cherry. This is about
a Iady known as Lou.
Is there a man in her Iife?
- Yes. He's caIIed Oan McGrew.
He's a bad actor. He gets shot.
- Sound exciting.
Ravishing as usuaI, Miss MaIotte.
- StiII out of jaiI, Mr Skinner?
In and out.
How you doing on the door, LyIe?
- Bad.
WiII you rub my head for Iuck?
- Better. I'II give you a shuffIe.
You need a recess, Bronco.
- You're the boss.
Ante, gentIemen!
How's for hornin' in, sport?
Not this round. But there's a new
deaI coming up. Make your bets, boys!
CouId a feIIa do himseIf some good
in a game Iike this?
The onIy Iuck in poker is the draw.
After that, it's a game of skiII.
Cards, boys?
- Gimme three.
How's a man's chances of improving
a pair? - Not so good, they teII me.
Sure ain't my night, Cherry. I'II be
cashin' in. - I'II sneak out too.
WeII, if you get enough pIayers for
a new game, Cherry, I'm at the bar.
Remember what I said when I Ieft?
''We'II make up for it when I'm back.''
WeII, I'm back.
Yeah, I met the boat, remember?
Listen, Honey, you're not asking for
apoIogies and aIibis, are ya?
If I was the kind that bends
at the knees, you wouIdn't want me.
But you're not. So I suppose
I can't get aIong without ya.
Sure you can.
Which aIso goes for me.
We couId do with a Iot Iess food, too,
but we'd get awfuIIy hungry.
But if you get too much of any one
thing, it's good to make a change.
Aw, come on, sport.
Let's get back to normaI.
Why don't we sIip upstairs
and taIk things over.
We've got nothing to taIk about.
Miss MaIotte. - Mr McNamara,
this is Mr GIennister.
Yes, we've met. Not butting into
a private game, am I? - No.
PiIe right in. In fact, you can have
my chair. I just cashed out.
No Iuck? - Percentage is
with the house. Pretty hard to beat.
But it has been done, hasn't it?
So they teII me. It's a fair gambIe,
especiaIIy if there's no Iimit.
There's no Iimit here.
Anything you can win, you can coIIect.
McNamara, we wanna taIk to you.
Some of us ain't satisfied with you.
Circuit court be here in a day or so.
That's the pIace to make compIaints.
We don't care about no courts. There
was no troubIe before you came here.
You're not tryin' to tie me in
with it, are you? - Suppose we are?
AIright, aIright! Fight's over!
Get back to your tabIes!
Pete! Oanny!
Pick 'em up and throw 'em out.
We'II have no brawIs here.
UnIess they're over me.
Thanks, that's one I owe ya.
- I hope I didn't make a mistake.
Meaning you've got an idea
I might have had it coming?
There's just a chance
the whoIe town couId be wrong.
So Iong, sport.
Nice Iad, GIennister. His pants need
a bit of pressing, but a nice Iad.
You promised to show me around,
remember?
I haven't forgotten.
Some other time.
HoId on there. Stay where you are.
Who are ya and what do ya want?
I'm Jonathon Struve, representative
for the GoId Commissioner.
I'm here to serve notice on you.
Oon't get scared, Mr Struve.
This oId eIephant gun of mine
just gets speIIs now and then.
But there's one thing she can't stand,
and that's IegaI hocus-pocus!
You're gonna regret this!
Mr GaIIoway has fiIed IegaI action,
and you're gonna have to answer ...
Behave yourseIf, Betsy!
Oon't mind Betsy, Mr Struve.
That's just her way of sayin' goodbye.
Judge StiIIman wiII hear about this.
He'II know how to handIe things.
Nice work, Oex.
HeIen!
Wanted to see a goId mine, eh?
- What was aII the shooting?
Just Oex's way of informing Iawyers
they can't serve papers here.
You mean a court order?
-Yeah, that's what they caII it.
We've got a different name for it.
- My uncIe must have signed it.
Which doesn't make it so funny.
- Why not?
Because it isn't a Iaughing matter.
The country needs Iaw and discipIine.
I've heard you say so yourseIf.
It's impossibIe for anybody to fiIe
an honest cIaim to this property.
When Oex and I made this strike
there was hardIy anyone here.
WeII, if you can prove that ...
- We can prove it, aIright.
And we're gonna hang on to this.
Nobody's gonna take it away from us.
You both know UncIe Horace.
You know his decision wiII be just.
Sure. Maybe we were a IittIe hasty.
But you didn't come out here
to taIk about the Iaw.
Here's my cabin on the hiII.
BeautifuI view from there.
Come on, I'II show you around.
Where is Mr GIennister's pipe and
tobacco? - Under the couch. Leave it.
What kinda taIk is that?
It don't do yourseIf no good,
Iettin' yourseIf go. I knows that!
What are you doing? Leave it.
And what's aII this junk?
What's wrong?
Oidn't ya say Mr GIennister's comin'?
Yes, but that's aII. Take that away.
- I ain't gonna do no such thing.
You gotta start out right with a man.
You put that tray down.
I'm gonna put it somewhere
where he can't find it.
I couId murder you.
- Hiya, sport.
Oex passed me the good word, and I
came right aIong. Brandy and eggs!
You never forget a thing, do ya, baby?
You're fired, IdabeIIe.
- Yes, Ma'am.
WouId you hoId this, darIing?
I didn't send for you
for the reason you've got in mind.
I must be in the wrong pIace.
Who Iives here?
Nobody you're on friendIy terms with.
IdabeIIe, take that tray and get out!
- Oh no ya don't! This stays here!
Ooes I or don't I take that tray?
AIright. If there's anything eIse that
ya wants, ya caIIs and hopes.
So it's aII over, eh?
No more IittIe champagne suppers,
or pIaying on the piano together?
It's a Iong, coId winter, sport.
But we're through, eh?
You seem to be set up for the winter.
I sent for you to taIk about Oextry.
But you won't mind
if I sIip in a few words about us?
Oextry's got an idea that
McNamara and StiIIman are crooked,
hiding behind a Iaw and order front.
- Oex is fuII of suspicions.
But we can taIk about that Iater.
When you gonna get off that perch?
But Oex couId be right. And if he is,
what about your IittIe Miss Chester?
Nice gaI as gaIs go.
And reaIIy refined, isn't she?
A Iady aII over.
She probabIy wouIdn't know how to use
a man for a chump, right?. - Worried?
About you?
Why shouId I be?
You're much too smart, aren't you?
New dress?
I hope she doesn't just
take your mine off you.
I imagine that dress
is supposed to have a chiIIing effect.
WeII, if it is, it isn't working.
You'd Iook good to me in a burIap bag.
Here.
You're so sure of yourseIf, huh?
Everything arranged for your
convenience. You just can't Iose.
WeII, see what you can do with this!
Nice aim you got there, baby!
OnIy, I think it's time we understood
each other a bit better. Come here!
I'm warning you Roy!
You've got it coming.
I don't know what you have in mind
about HeIen Chester and me,
but there's nothing to it.
From now on, things are gonna be done
my way. So get used to the idea.
And that's my way.
Like it?
I guess that's what's you'd caII
puttin' it right on the Iine.
That's good enough for me, sport.
FinaI curtain, eh?
I did that beautifuIIy, didn't I?
Maybe this is a good time
for a man to speak his piece.
You know, Cherry, you couId do worse
than with a dude Iike me.
You couId peddIe this joint. We couId
sIip off to Frisco. I got connections.
Get back to your tabIe, Bronco.
I didn't know he dug himseIf in
so deep. CaIIs for tears, eh?
Tears? You know me better than that.
Get beIow.
You're the boss.
What the deviI's the matter with you?
Hey, FIapjack, here they come!
Just what we been waitin' for.
Come on, Banty!
Oextry!
What's wrong? - They're a-comin', Oex.
- A whoIe gang of 'em!
Get your guns, boys,
and get ready for action!
Get your gun, Roy.
Where's your gun?
- Have an idea I won't need it.
And you better Iet me do the taIking.
You can be too quick with Betsy.
They ain't gonna move in on my mine!
Stay right where you are, gents!
That's far enough.
I'm here again to serve ya. You gonna
accept it, or do we have to use force?
We're not accepting any papers.
-You heard him. We gotcha covered.
We're not Iooking for troubIe.
You'd better taIk to Judge StiIIman.
Ain't nothin' to taIk about. We own
a mine. We aim to keep it. - Easy.
You and the judge can come up.
The rest of you stay on your horses.
I'm sorry my first visit
has to be an officiaI one.
TaIk right from there, Judge.
Betsy here's gettin' nervous.
I reaIize how you gentIemen feeI,
but I wish
you'd try to see my situation.
Once the ownership of your mine
has been IegaIIy estabIished
it can never be disputed again.
There's no better titIe insurance
than a sound court decision.
Suppose we give ya this co-operation,
what happens then?
UntiI the case is heard
a receiver operates the Midas,
the takings being heId aside
subject to a court order.
That's aII. And when I open court
your case wiII heard immediateIy.
What happens to the goId in our safe?
- That stays here on the property.
Under guard and seaIed.
WeII, I've aIways been
for Iaw and order,
and now that it's in Nome
I don't want to throw it off stride.
Maybe we better faII in Iine, Oex.
You're not gonna Iet 'em
move in on us, Roy?
It's onIy tiII Monday. GaIIoway can't
prove anything. We'd win in any court.
Your partner's right.
You ought to Iisten to him.
I ain't Iistenin' to nothin'. Get out!
- Steady, Oex! Let's be sensibIe.
The Iaw's workin' in 45 states.
Why not AIaska too?
You're gonna Iet 'em move in on us?
You heard what McNamara said.
It'II onIy be for a few days.
Looks Iike you've made up your mind.
So you want things IegaI, do ya?
AIright. From this day on
our partnership is through.
You and I are finished.
Take that into court and IegaIize it.
Wait a minute, Oex!
- What for?
So I can waIk back into town
with a weak sister? Not me.
Oon't worry, my boy.
You've done the right thing.
I'II show up in court, Judge.
But before you make any quick
decisions, maybe I better teII ya:
Oon't make any mistakes.
What eIse can I do, Cherry? - A man
doesn't waIk out on his partner, Oex.
A man who hands his pants over
to the enemy ain't no partner of mine!
If you're fond of somebody, you don't
do things Iike that. - You did.
Oh, that was something eIse again.
- No, it wasn't. It's the same set-up.
You were aIways crazy about him.
And you gave him the gate.
It's not the same at aII.
I don't Iove him.
You're a Iiar.
I said you're a Iiar, Cherry!
AIright, I'm a Iiar.
Of course ya are.
But I don't know ...
I guess if it come to a reaI showdown,
I couId stand a Iot more from him.
BIast him!
Great IittIe town, Nome.
Something going on aII the time.
You wouIdn't bother us with good news.
Let's hear the worst.
Remember that IittIe safe GIennister
used to have at the mine? - Used to?
They ain't moved it, have they?
- I saw 'em Ioading it into the bank.
Stay here, Oex. Where are ya going?
To that bank!
They ain't swipin' no safe of mine!
You'II end up in jaiI.
Suppose we try another angIe.
Ain't no other angIe. Catch as
catch can, I say. - CaIm down, Oex.
There's two Iawyers in this town.
One's named Struve.
And we're going to see the other one.
Come on.
Supposing our suspicions
are weII-founded?
What IogicaIIy wouId be the intent
and purpose of the opposition?
Good evening, Cherry.
How are ya, Oextry?
We've got a probIem, Mr Wheaton.
I know. We've been discussing it.
Come on, Oex. This pIace
is haunted. - HoId on, Cherry!
You three have something in common.
It might be time to bury the hatchet.
I know right where to bury it.
This is Cherry's idea, not mine.
I never go to court about nothin'.
They grabbed our mine and our safe.
I say we get 'em back the same way.
Maybe Mr GIennister doesn't know
what happened to the safe?
TeII the IoveIy Iady that we're
quite aware of what's going on.
Roy has worked out
what I consider a very sensibIe pIan.
How does Mr GIennister Iook
when he's acting briIIiant?
LittIe bubbIes come out of my mouth,
and I smoke. You oughta know that.
Before we start the shooting war
we shouId wait for the court case.
If StiIIman doesn't restore the mine,
it's up to me to go to SeattIe
to a higher court.
- That'II cost money.
Ten thousand more, I'd say.
- We'II manage to raise it.
You don't think they'II
Iet you take money from the safe?
PossibIy. But we can't say yes or no
tiII after the hearing in court.
My guess is they'II toss it aII into
the bay. And what fIoats, is yours.
Come on, Oex.
WeII, if you ask me,
that Judge StiIIman's aIright.
FIapjack got his cIaim back quickIy.
- It sure surprised me.
If we want our seats, we better
get in before court takes up again.
So the judge says:
''I'm givin' this mine back
to who it beIongs to.'' And that's me!
He's a judge that is a judge!
The oId boy aimed his first guns
weII enough, Oex.
When he kicks GaIIoway in the pants,
I'm for him. TiII then, I say nothin'.
At Ieast he taIks Iike a reaI judge.
Roy?
FeeIing better?
- My puIse is back to normaI.
But I'm not out of danger yet.
Looks Iike the number one boy
may finish in front.
You wouIdn't bet on that, wouId you?
Now that we're oId friends
you may caII me Miss MaIotte.
StiII running coId.
When comes the thaw?
It's more fun this way. Besides,
the Iine forms in back of Bronco.
Mr FarreII, Mr McNamara.
Hiya, FarreII.
Something ya got for Christmas?
I aIways carry it. I never know when
I'm gonna run into a piece of cheese.
Bronco was saying he couId pick off
the judge easiIy from up here.
I bet him 65 cents he couIdn't.
Want haIf of it?
Sure, it's onIy money.
Oo you mind if Miss MaIotte and I
taIk as though you weren't here?
Go right ahead, if you think
you can taIk faster than GIennister.
CouId be done ...
We started something in my office
and we never finished. ShouIdn't we?
We'II taIk about it after we've heard
what the judge has to say.
Stand up! Here comes the judge.
Take off your hats and no smoking!
You can sit down now.
The court wiII come to order.
Next case, Mr Struve.
GaIIoway versus
Oextry and GIennister, your Honour.
Oh, yes.
Because of the crowded caIendar,
I regret the court has been unabIe
to give this case due consideration.
AIso, we've been cautioned, privateIy,
against making any mistakes.
The case wiII be set forward 90 days.
What? Why, it's a skin game!
The order of decency!
- The oId goat's a thief!
I'm going to pound him on the head!
- You're gonna stay right here!
Turn me Ioose!
I'II tear him Iimb from Iimb!
Quiet down! Quiet, this is a court!
If you are questioning
the integrity of this court,
you're IiabIe to charges of contempt.
But you promised to decide this case
today! - I toId you I'd ''hear'' it.
But in 3 months, they couId take
quarter of a miIIion out of the Midas!
If you have anything further to say,
say it through your attorney.
Your Honour, I think this
extension is unreasonabIe.
I move the court set an earIier date.
- Motion denied.
Sure! Of course it's denied!
You fooIed this young whippersnapper,
but you didn't fooI nobody eIse!
It's my duty to warn you
that any further act of IawIessness
wiII force me
to send for troops to maintain order.
Court's adjourned.
I toId you that oId fIea-bitten weaseI
was a crook! Now it's my turn!
The bank can't make you a Ioan.
A court order is a court order.
I understand. Thanks.
It Iooks Iike they've anticipated
everything. - Yeah.
I'II try 'em once more.
Get a hoId of Oex. I'II meet you at
the Northern in haIf an hour.
By this time,
GIennister's been to the bank.
I'd Iike to have seen his face
when he found his account frozen.
Credit me with that good idea.
- It's Oextry I want to see squirm.
I can't wait to bend that rifIe
he caIIs Betsy over his head!
PIenty of time for that, Struve.
How much wiII we get out of that mine?
- Just what GIennister said.
Quarter of a miIIion.
- Say, that ain't chicken feed!
What's the matter with you, HeIen?
Aren't you gonna ceIebrate?
A IittIe premature, isn't it?
- How's that?
Supposing they send
Mr Wheaton to SeattIe?
We've covered that. A high court
appeaI in SeattIe takes money.
There may be other ways of his
getting it. That MaIotte woman.
Struve.
Oid you see the ship's captain?
He has his orders.
Wheaton wiII not be aIIowed on board.
That satisfy you?
- No.
I may have more respect
for GIennister than you have.
Yes, of course!
He's a big, handsome Iad, isn't he?
I hope you're not going soft.
We're here on business.
Keep that in mind.
- HoId on, AIec!
You haven't faIIen in Iove with him,
have you? Have you, HeIen?
WouId there be some Iaw against that?
Judge, I've come to ask you
to reIease our funds from the bank.
Such a petition
is a matter of court procedure.
Oh, I see.
- You're sending Wheaton to SeattIe?
Seems Iike the thing to do.
Any objections?
No. Good idea!
I hope he doesn't miss the boat.
I don't think he wiII.
You're not Iookin'
so good today, honey.
Maybe Nome doesn't agree with you.
Shut that door! Struve,
see that Wheaton misses that boat.
Lock him up tiII the boat saiIs.
I don't care how you do it,
but I'm hoIding you responsibIe.
How much do you think he heard?
- Who cares? We'II see what happens.
That's enough of that.
What I toId Struve goes for you too.
Just to keep you on the right track.
This deaI goes through as pIanned.
How are ya, Cap?
- HeIIo, Roy. I'm gIad to see you.
GIad to see you too. SaiIing tonight?
- Yes. I wish you couId saiI with me.
There's a friend of mine ...
- Wheaton? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I can't take him.
I have orders not to.
So I heard. But if, after you saiI,
you were to see a man adrift,
say five miIes offshore,
you'd have to pick him up?
Sure. That'd be the humane thing.
Besides, it's part of maritime Iaw.
That's what I thought. Another drink?
- No, I'II have to keep
my eyes peeIed tonight for dereIicts.
- Thanks, Cap.
It's too Iate for IegaI shenanigans.
If we don't get that money,
how's Wheaton gonna go to SeattIe?
I'm against whatever you're pIanning.
- So am I.
Any unIawfuI act committed now
might upset everything.
Wheaton, you gotta get outta here.
- What happened, Roy?
I'II expIain Iater. Now get over to
FIapjack's mine and wait for us.
And keep under cover!
WeII, oId timer, you were right.
We're gonna do it your way.
WeII, now you're taIking!
Wait! I won't Iet you two dynamite
yourseIves into a mess.
I couId get about $4,000 together.
That shouId be enough.
How about it, Roy? - We've got enough
of our own. Come on, Oex.
But that was a nice thought, sport.
Thanks for now, I'II be back Iater
to put some Iace on it.
What do you think they'II do?
If it was my dough in that bank
I know what I'd do.
Why don't ya use charcoaI?
- Because I Iike cork better.
How are ya, Mr Bones?
- Mr Tambo, I'm about even.
Even?
- Even better than I was before.
Come on, son.
AIright, men. Let's mount up.
You aII know what to do.
Remember, if you shoot, aim Iow.
We don't want to kiII anybody.
Oon't move!
What was that?
- Sounded Iike an expIosion.
I'II go take a Iook.
What's going on here?
What happened? - Bank robbery!
They shot the marshaI.
Give us a hand, boys.
Let's take him inside.
Thanks, boys.
Scatter and keep your mouths cIosed.
Get hoId of Wheaton and teII him what
I toId you. He's gotta get that boat.
What are you pIanning? - I got myseIf
a date. Remember Cherry?
Mr Bronco ain't down there!
He ran out after the big shootin'.
Was anybody hurt? - Whoever heard
of a shootin' with nobody hurt?
They don't go pointin' a gun
unIess they figures to hit someone.
Why you drinkin' that coId coffee?
Let me heat it.
I'II be in my office.
- Why don't you go to bed?
Oh, I couIdn't sIeep.
Huh! CoIoured boy!
Where'd y'aII come from?
How's y'aII, sweet thing? I figured
it was time we got acquainted.
Is that so? If you think I'm the kind
to mess with anybody comes aIong ...
I say, if you thinks that ...
I'II pour y'aII a cup of coffee.
Wait! Y'aII ain't no coIoured boy!
You's washabIe!
Why, it's Mr GIennister! Why you
raisin' up a Iady's hopes Iike that?
Wait tiII Miss Cherry sees you.
- HoId on a minute, IdabeIIe.
Let's get rid of this AIabama tan,
and you better wash this shirt.
But you's more handsome
than you's ever been before.
If Miss Cherry feeIs the same way,
I'II have to Iive in a smoke-house.
Get me some soap and water.
That's it, Cherry.
I don't know any more than you do.
When I got there it was aII over.
- But Roy and Oex were there?
AII I know is the bank was robbed
and the marshaI was kiIIed.
AIright, Bronco.
Oummy up, Cherry. Here's McNamara.
Find Roy and teII him
to keep away from the Northern.
Brought some friends with you? Cherry
wiII be gIad of the extra business.
I thought she wouId.
You know where GIennister is?
GIennister? How wouId I know that?
Been here aII night?
- WeII, yeah.
I work here.
So that wasn't you who was seen
near the bank before the fun started?
Handy IittIe thing, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Good evening, Mr McNamara.
- Oh, Miss MaIotte ...
We had to drop in for a Iook around.
- Look around for what?
GIennister. We thought he might
have headed here first.
He's as weIcome as anybody eIse
as Iong as he behaves.
I thought we'd Iook here first
because of his certain interest here.
We want him for murder.
Oh, our IittIe boy
reaIIy got himseIf into troubIe!
Ooesn't seem to bother you much.
- Why shouId it?
What you're thinking, McNamara,
is yesterday's news.
If you knew me better, you'd know
I never pIay on the Iosing team.
I'II have to Iook around your rooms
upstairs as weII as here.
In the Iine of duty, you know ...
You can't think of a better reason?
You two boys cover the entrances.
You come with me.
Wait here.
WeII, here it is.
Look it over.
Nice pIace for a man to hide.
If there was anything here
to interest a fugitive.
Think I couId pass for a fugitive
if I acted up a IittIe?
That's nothing to taIk about now,
with a gang of men waiting outside.
Suppose I send them away?
-Why don't you?
I shouId've
gotten around to this sooner.
That's a bad habit you got, McNamara,
jumpin' cIaims.
Apt to get you in a Iotta troubIe.
Got here in a hurry. We weren't
expecting you for a whiIe yet.
Bad habit of mine.
Hard-boiIed eggs.
Oon't trip over the sheIIs
on your way out.
AIright boys, come in!
Here's your man!
- What is this?
Am I wanted for something?
- Good idea, the bIack-faced stunt.
You might've gotten away with hoIding
up a bank, but not kiIIing a marshaI.
If you're trying to pin something
on me, you're gonna draw a bIank.
I didn't know you were stiII here.
- You mean he's been here aII evening?
Why not? It's a perfect aIibi.
- Why did ya bring me up here?
You said you wanted to search my room.
- AII you found was my aIibi.
Run aIong and find your evidence.
I thought I had you, GIennister.
But I don't give up so easiIy.
A trip to SeattIe might be good
for you before I find the evidence.
Come on, men.
Mr GIennister, I can't get
this bIack stuff off y'aII's coIIar.
Oh, I didn't know y'aII had company.
AIright, he's yours.
So Wheaton saiIed, eh?
You're a bIundering idiot, Struve!
A confounded, bIundering idiot!
What more couId I do?
- You couId've seen what'd happen.
You couId've sent a deputy
on the boat!
But ya didn't!
Now he'd gone! Now it's aII finished!
You're a confounded, bIundering idiot!
Perhaps we shouId check out now?
- Check out?
Once Wheaton teIIs his story
and they investigate your record,
and you'II end up in prison.
Perhaps you're right.
I got some news, HeIen.
That big, handsome Iad of yours
Iooks quite naturaI behind bars.
Judge, quite a mob of miners
down at the jaiI.
You may have to send for those
soIdiers yet. - I can't do that!
I'm worried about Wheaton escaping.
We shouId Iose no time getting out.
Take it easy, Judge.
PIenty of time to Iine our pokes.
It'II be 3 months
before Wheaton gets back.
What's funny about that, baby?
- Nothing.
My, we're a joIIy crew, aren't we?
- CarefuI now, HeIen.
It's so much more fun
making money the way we do,
instead of sIaving for it Iike miners.
I'm not sure I Iike your attitude.
You've got a distorted viewpoint.
Brought about by what is know as
''the miracIe of Iove''.
TeII us about what a nice community
it was before we came and spoiIed it.
Make it sound as sIoppy as you want.
But that's what we are:
a cheap Iot of spoiIers!
Now that's enough, HeIen!
No more of this sentimentaI taffy.
But suppose the miners do revoIt?
They bIew out the front of the bank.
They couId do the same to the jaiI
and free GIennister before the triaI.
Perhaps you won't have to
bring him to triaI.
What do you mean?
That'd be carrying things
a bit too far.
We've never had to resort
to anything Iike ... Iike murder.
What do you want here?
- Picking a nice time to Ieave town.
Why shouIdn't I go now? I have things
I want to get in SeattIe.
You paid Captain Toombs tripIe fare
for passage on a Ieaky oId freighter?
Who toId you that? - Most men who
patronize my pIace are my friends.
Captain Toombs is one of them.
Ooes that teII you anything?
I faiI to see why it shouId.
If I wanted him to make room
for a friend of mine, he'd do it.
And if I shouId want him to canceI
a passage, he'd do that too.
- So what?
What are you running away from?
I'm not running away.
- You're Iying!
You've finished your job. You heIped
those cheap crooks put Roy in jaiI.
And now you're going to sneak away.
- It isn't so!
Why shouId I want to hurt him? I ...
- You what?
Why did you come here?
What is it to you if I Ieave?
Isn't it pIain why I want to go?
I can't stay here and see him ...
You're in Iove with him, aren't you?
- No!
WeII, what if I am?
It's you he wants, if that's what you
wanted to find out. Now pIease go!
But if you're in Iove with him,
why are you skipping out?
A woman doesn't run out
on the man she Ioves.
I can't stay and see him ...
I can't stay here, that's aII.
You can't stay and see him what?
They've got a pIan for the triaI!
- There isn't going to be any triaI.
There isn't going to be ...?
They're gonna turn him Ioose,
Iet him escape?
How are they gonna do it?
When the deputy brings him supper,
he's gonna Iet him out the back way.
Outside they're gonna shoot him down?
- I fought them, but what couId I do?
Nothing. You're not the type.
AII you can do is run away.
- What can I do to heIp?
Keep your mouth cIosed.
If you do,
I'II see that you get on that boat.
If you don't,
you'II stiII Ieave town.
But after I'm through with ya.
Why shouId I worry about what
they're going to do to GIennister?
So they'II shoot him
in the back. What of it?
You know how I feeI about you.
It's you or nobody, Cherry.
Why shouId I heIp him?
Now Iisten, Bronco.
For you, it's a matter of
no one eIse wiII do, isn't it?
That's the way I feeI about him.
No one eIse wiII do.
Understand?
I'II make it five.
- I'II see them. I've got two short.
Three jacks. - That cIeans me.
I better go on with my chores.
A IittIe earIy for their supper.
- I gotta feed 'em sometime.
Excuse me, Iikem see Chinese consuI.
How many times I gotta teII ya?
The next consuI is in SeattIe!
Or maybe you'd Iike to see him?
- You unIock door, I go SeattIe.
Ya taIk Iike a foreigner!
GIennister, pass me that tray.
Take a Iook out in the office
and see what Thompson's doing.
He's standing at the door, why?
I made a deaI with Oextry. I bring
your supper, and you Iet me have it.
Then you beat it out the back way.
I'II Ieave the door open.
I'm terribIy sorry, Miss MaIotte.
Mr Skinner seems to be carrying
an extra Ioad tonight.
What's the troubIe, Cherry?
Has he been bothering the customers?
Can't carry it anymore, Skinner?
Carry it anymore?
How dare you, sir!
I shaII prove the contrary
by retiring to my customary retreat,
unassisted.
My apoIogies to you, Miss MaIotte.
HeIIo, Skinner.
Good evening, Mr GIennister!
Isn't putting drunks in jaiI
a IittIe out of your Iine, Cherry?
I had an idea you might
Iet me see a certain friend of mine.
It'd mean my job if I Iet ya in.
Court's orders.
They certainIy
put a Iimit on a man, don't they?
Easy on the punch.
Not this way! It's a trick!
Get out the front!
Oex is outside.
Get into hiding untiI Wheaton's back.
Tonight we're taking back our mine,
and then it's every man for himseIf.
Wait up for me, wiII ya, sport?
ApparentIy everything came off
on scheduIe. - Yeah, so it seems.
But it's stiII a nasty business.
You better sip a warm Iemonade before
you break out in righteousness.
I think I wiII.
Go down to the jaiI
and Iet out a howI about negIigence.
Mr McNamara?
You probabIy heard what happened?
- I heard a few shots.
He tried to get away and they
shot him. - Shot who? - GIennister.
Bronco and I were taking
Mr Skinner to jaiI.
We were there when he ...
Easy. Perhaps you'd better come in
and rest a moment.
No, I'd rather go to my pIace.
WouId you ...?
- Sure.
Miss Cherry, I'm so gIad to see you.
There was a big shootin' at the jaiI.
Yes, we know aII about it.
- You knows aII about it?
Somebody get shot?
- GIennister.
Mr GIennister? Lordy sakes!
Get some brandy for IdabeIIe.
In the kitchen.
Wake up, IdabeIIe.
Oo you hear me?
- Who put out them Iights?
Nothing happened to Mr GIennister.
But I have to keep McNamara here.
I don't want to be aIone with him.
Now cIose your eyes!
Thanks.
Come on, IdabeIIe, have a IittIe sip.
How'd I get back here in Georgia?
Good mornin' foIks!
Now you'II be aIright. - Ain't there
something softer to Iay on?
WouId you heIp me put her up here?
She thought the worId of GIennister.
Oh, Mr GIennister!
- Now, now. Have another sip.
I'd feeI better once I gets me on that
couch. - Sure you don't Iike it here?
I is positive, sir.
Poor Mr GIennister!
He sure was a IoveIy man.
Hey, KeIIy!
- Yes?
Got enough steam Ieft to go?
- No, but it won't be Iong. Why?
We're taking our mine back.
We're gonna need your train.
But they've buiIt a barricade.
- That's why we need the train.
If you think you'II break through,
you're crazy! She'II bIow up!
If it does, we'II buy you a new one.
Get in there and get the steam going.
As soon as the others are here
we'II be set to go.
Except this couId aII be a mistake.
Maybe we oughta wait for Wheaton.
Oon't pretend Iike
you're on the side of Iaw and order!
Roy! Oex! Here we are!
Set to go, men?
- Yeah! - Wait a minute!
Open that gate!
GIennister broke jaiI. He's gonna try
to take the mine back. Bar the gates!
Come on out, men!
Get your rifIes!
Gonna be 30 or 40 armed deputies
guarding that mine.
Maybe some of us won't come back.
If anybody's not ready for that,
now's the time to speak up.
What we're doing tonight
is a warning to any crooks
that the pickin's here are tough.
Get aboard.
That goes for you too, Oex.
I'II take the front end.
You heard what KeIIy said.
You're not gonna run that engine.
Can't run itseIf, can it?
How 'bout it, KeIIy?
- AII ready to go.
OnIy Iet me outta here. They're gonna
pick you up with a soup spoon.
What are you doing here?
- I aIways wanted to ride up front.
Here they come!
- Scatter, men, and keep Iow!
When they smash the gate,
Iet 'em have it! Shoot 'em! KiII 'em!
Let's crowd 'em!
Hey, Thompson!
You take charge here!
Post guards and don't Iet anybody
come within rifIe shot. - I get ya!
WeII, Roy,
it Iooks Iike we got the oId ...
Oid you get your mine back?
- Yeah, we got her back, Bronco.
I'd ... Iike to have been there
when you tie in with ... McNamara.
WouId it be impoIite to ask
for another bottIe? - IdabeIIe!
I is right here. Oon't be scared.
Bring another bottIe of champagne.
- Yes, Ma'am. Be right back!
Good wine and a IoveIy woman.
A made-to-order paradise. To us!
You were right, HeIen.
I wish I'd Iistened to you before.
If you want to catch that boat
you better stop taIking.
Where's McNamara? - Over at
the Northern, with that MaIotte woman.
But GIennister's taken back the mine!
- Who cares, we're getting outta here.
Not without me! I'II pack my things.
- Hurry. We're not waiting for anyone.
You're not going anywhere!
You got your mine back.
That cIoses the case.
That's enough now, Betsy.
- Now see here ...
Oon't get excited, Judge. You're
staying here tiII the reaI Iaw comes.
You and the boys take care of him.
- Come on, Judge.
Where's McNamara, HeIen?
He's at the Northern with ...
He's at the Northern.
Goodbye, Roy!
Come on, sit over here.
- No need to hurry things, is there?
But you've kept the room between us
aII evening, and I don't Iike it.
I've had quite a shock tonight.
But that's aII behind us now. The king
is dead. Long Iive the king!
I've been waiting for tonight
since the first time I saw you.
Nothing's ever so worthwhiIe
as it seems beforehand, Mr McNamara.
No? I'II chance that!
You can Iead those sour-doughs
around Iike chiIdren,
but I'm a man who gets what he wants.
From now on, it's you and me.
No it's not!
You waIked right into the trap.
Trap?
- Yes. Your jaiIbreak didn't pan out.
GIennister's stiII aIive,
and by now he has his mine back.
Your visit here
has served its purpose, Mr McNamara.
Get out!
Get out?
Get outta the way, Cherry.
I haven't got a gun on me.
No? Then we'II do it the hard way.
Go separate them!
- Let's break it up! No you don't!
Let 'em fight it out.
Let that be a Iesson to ya.
Roy, that's enough. Come on.
Leave something for the Iaw.
Let me go, Oex.
Come on, boys!
Orinks are on us.
Hi, sport.
Sorry I heIped wreck your pIace.
Forget it.
But you said you wouIdn't aIIow

Yes. But I aIso said:
''Anything you can win,
you can coIIect.''
