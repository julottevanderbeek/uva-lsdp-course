as were all the cowboys on the ranch,
he was still taken by irresistible
charm of Helen Clayton,
The boss, the ol' Ben Clayton,
the owner of the ranch,
was a simple man with good sense.
"I'd like to give this to you, Miss ...
Keep it as a reminder of me,
and if you're ever in need,
send it back to me as as possible ...
I'll know what that means."

that's a beautiful house!"
"Pretty nice, isn't it?"

"Me? ... No ...
... What are you saying!"
"Yes! With you, Helen."
Courage tested ...
"Helen and I,
we'd like to get married ...."
"After all, what can you
offer her, my boy?"

acres of land ... a house ...
a little money in the Bank ..."
"My... er ...heart, to make her happy...
... and my two arms to work with!"

for a long time that I would
lose her some day;
But I'd never thought it
would be this tough! "

We'll gather them so you
can examine them closely."

since that stranger arrived?"
Now it was the turn of a foal,
the pride of the ranch.

that had already killed
three cowboys.
"Here is the horse they call
the Cowboys Killer"

Then the days went by ...
"Why don't you come
with me to the city ...?
... being Eugene Thornton's,
wife, doesn't that sound nice?"
"What about Cheyenne?...
... Cheyenne has my promise."
"Never mind! ...
His kind quickly forget."
"... and we'll get married when
we arrive in New York."

Oh, there's no place like home!"
"Helen hasn't down yet ...
Wait a minute ...
I'll tell her you're here."
"Congratulations, Cheyenne!...
I got married four times! ...
and I get stronger and sturdier!"
Dear Dad.
This is to say farewell.
Say goodbye to Cheyenne for me.
Helen.
"Come on, ... be brave, ol'boy! ...
It's... it's pretty tough
for me too!"
The last day of the
trip to the big city.
Arrived in the prestigious
city at last ...
Loneliness, dreams
and memories ...
"Here, ol'man! I can't help it!
I am taking the high trail! ...
If SHE ever comes back...
I want her to have the little
house I had built for her."
It was the first letter received
by Cheyenne since the wedding
announcement sent to him long ago.
Dear Harry,
I remembered what you told me
When you gave me the souvenir
you made for me, and...
I am sending it to you
with this letter.
Helen.
"Quick, a ticket to New York."
"Wait ...? ...
Oh, I'll show you!"
At the Columbia Hotel
in New York.
"Careful, boy! ...
when they whistle like that,
it means they're about
to jump on you, to bite you!"
Meanwhile, Helen was meeting
the charming Glady for the first time,
whom Thornton had introduced
to her as his sister.
"I'm going to give a
reception on the terrace
of the Columbia Hotel,
to celebrate our engagement."

to deliver a train full of horses
to their buyers.
Cheyenne was wondering
just where he should start
looking for Helen.
He was just about to find
a seasoned guide.
"I'll telling you, again, try to get
in touch with that oaf.
We'll see what he's up to."
"A nice guy, isn't he?"
"Yes!... I have come here
to find my fiancèe ...
A snake of a man look her away ...
and her father all alone
and upset out in Wyoming."
"I'm here to find her ...
... and I will stay until
I set her free."
"What bravery! Alright!
If I can help you, believe me,
I'd like to give you a hand."
"Say, I like this guy! ...
I can't swindle him!"
"Give me back my money."
"To the health of Eugene Thornton
and to the graceful fiancèe...
he brought back from the wild
solitude of Wyoming!"
"Ah! It's the young woman
the cowboy, showed me
in the picture!"
As the evening went by,
Helen could see the real character
of Thornton showing through.
"We should call the manager!"
"Call the station and tell them,
Buck Hoover and his cowboys ...
should come and meet me
here right away."
"If we had known that we'd
have visitors we'd have
washed up a little."
