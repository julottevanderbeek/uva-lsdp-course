Goody:
Close 'er up, Goody!
Goody:
Keep it going, boys.
Damn!
Back to work, Peckerwood.
You're a goner, Dub!
Yeah, shoot him in the knees!
You got lots of fans, Dub.
Prisoner: Bash his head in!
Come on now. Bash it!
Simmer down, fellas.
You'll get your boy as
soon as we get ours.
Now, young swell, drop
that pepperbox in the dirt.
Real friendly-like or I'll
drop this hammer on you
and send ya on your way!
You hear?
I heard.
You can get it in there.
Now what?
Real good.
Fits real good.
Prisoner:
You gonna leave us chained
out here like a pack of hounds?
Take it easy on him, boys.
Hyah!
Get them keys! Get them keys!
Come on, man.
Ain't nothing like
stealing a law dog's horse.
Hope y'all are good on foot!
Yeah, Dub, you're next!
Hyah!
Goddamn, boy!
Jack put two inches
of chuck on his fanny.
Well, lookit here.
Look at that.
Well, well, could have
taken you for a leprechaun.
- Lookie here, Tom.
- Come on.
Looks like we're going
on a little treasure hunt.
- No, come on!
- Goddamn!
Here!
Jesus Christ! Like a bunch
of cackling hens!
Let's get a hinge of this here.
Galveston?
Hell, that's 60 miles
from the strike.
That's as far you made it?
Well, after all
that hell popped off
and I got separated from
you boys, I had to stash it.
I mean, my mare never would
have made it back to New Mex,
with 300 pounds of gold on it.
I mean, not with me
on it least ways.
Yeah, well, it didn't make
it neither way, you ninny.
Hell, we thought you was dead
till we heard you was sent up.
That's gotta be
Well, I wish I was dead
after spending six
months in that outfit!
Yeah!
I was lucky my mare
made it as far as Pecos.
Good you didn't give
them the drop on us, Jack.
And after we busted your
hocks out of the pokey,
the big question is,
is what's in that hard melon
the same as on here?
Identical.
That's my third draft.
I burnt the first two.
Damn twit!
Whatcha kicking him
about now, huh?
Don't trust Jack no more?
Hell, it took an act of congress
to get you out of New Mex.
And now you're belly-aching
about 500 measly miles
between us and retirement?
Blockey: We shall reap
the fruits of our journey.
I think the big question is,
are you going with us?
I'm not just going.
I'm the one taking us there!
And you best not
misremember that.
All right.
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, look out,
look out, hey, hey.
Button your damn vest,
you little midget!
Willie: Gather
around, fine folks
for Woody and Willie's
Wonderful Wagon of Wares.
- Do the voice.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
What do we got today, Willie?
Well, Woody, we got ourselves
a special wonder potion.
Wonder potion?
Can it do wonders on the piles?
'Cause I got 'em so bad
my wood's starting to canker.
Well, ain't that the dickens.
Well, this could be
your miracle cure.
It's good for everything from
gout to unpleasant mouth odor.
Even takes out stains and such.
You don't say?
Well, maybe it can get this blue
belly blood off of my uniform.
It sure can.
Here, let me show you.
-
- Oh!
- God!
- I... I got it.
Ah, yeah!
Would you gentlemen excuse
us for just a moment?
- Get in there! Get in there!
- Willie: It's fine.
I will show you,
you little poop dog!
- Willie: Ah!
- Yeah!
- Oh, you!
- Willie: Ow. Ow! Ow!
You're just a hindrance!
It's all you've ever been to me!
- Ow! Ow! I'm sorry!
- Oh, you're sorry?
I should never have taken
you out of that damn circus.
- Oh, I see that now.
- I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!
-  I didn't mean to.
- I'm sorry!
Ow! Ow!
Whoa! What, ah!
Stay put.
Knock him to
kingdom come, Mister!
- Don't! Please don't! No! No!
- How you like it?
No! No, no, no.
Goddammit!
For Chrissakes, Claude!
We can't leave a blood
trail clear across Texas.
You hear?
Why not?
-
- Ah!
What are we gonna
do with his son?
Kidnap him?
That ain't his paw.
He stole him from a traveling
show to sell his wares.
We're a bunch of
outlaws, ain't we, Tom?
Might be nice to have
an innocent face with us.
Since mine'll be pinned up all
over God's creation soon enough.
I, I, I can throw a Bowie knife
straighter than any pistol ball.
Hear that?
Good. You're hired.
Boys, rustle through that wagon.
See if he's got any sweets.
Just simmer down
up there, Willie.
Willie: High rollin'
flower farmer's got one of them
Damn telephone
in every apothecary.
Our way of life's in jeopardy,
boys.
That's dandy and all, but
we ain't got a pot to piss in.
These meager fixings won't
get us past tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, it's gonna take a little
green to get that gold.
Union Express runs
right through here.
Hell, the way I figure it, one
score leads to another score.
- Jack: Uh-huh.
- Amen.
Hear that?
Claude! Breathe easy now!
Whoo, Goody!
Come close to ending
up in a pine box
sneaking up on us like that.
And the darkness
breeds an evil spade.
Put the gun down, Block.
Hell's bells.
Look like you done busted out
the wrong rascal,
Nah, this is our tyro, Willie.
Slap Jack's over yonder.
Hey, Goody.
Come here and fix up some
of your goodness, huh?
Come on, cook us
up something good.
He's gonna be with
us for the duration.
Eh? Doo-ration?
We here already ain't we?
Yeah, well, Slap couldn't
handle the ruckus so he uh,
squirreled the bounty
in Galveston.
- Galveston?
- Claude: Uh-huh.
You mean we's going
all the way back?
Yep, at the bottom
of a well, to boot.
Ain't that a bad break.
Spit.
Go ahead, boy.
He just trying to fix you right.
Tom: The hell you been anyhow?
Sir, I was off scouting head
after I dropped y'all
boys off in the holes.
Come up on a pair of drovers
on they way to Junction, see?
Turns out they's pulpit men,
and they's carrying a thunder
mug of money with 'em too.
Some big mission over
at the Lutheran house.
Blockey: And yeh the Lord Provideth
in this time of drought.
I was brought up
Orthodox myself.
That's right.
Chapel.
Hell, we could take that
easy as falling off a log.
Junction's no slouch of a town.
That cussed ol' sheriff has
handled his share of highwaymen.
Tom: Yeah. We need a way
to ward off prying eyes then.
A diversion of sorts.
Claude: Exactly.
Might be I can help you fellers.
Go on, do it again!
That's funny.
Gather around, fine folks,
gather around!
Welcome to Willie and Woody's
Wonderful World of Wares.
Sheriff, get in here.
Come in here.
Today we have a
marvelous new elixir,
that is sure to get rid of all
your woes, whimpers and willies.
You can trust me, my son.
I, I was with my idiot
sidekick here, see?
And...
Oh, God, horrors!
I done seen horrors
you can't even imagine!
Oh, Lord! Help me!
I can't live with the sights
I seen today!
- I'm possessed!
- The Lord is with you.
It's a demon! It's choking me!
It's choking me from inside!
It's okay. Help me!
Calm yourself. Calm yourself!
It's all right.
My throat's parched!
Just breathe. Breathe.
Goody: Help me!
- Get him up.
- It's strangling...
Would you hold him over there?
Here come them
damn blue bellies.
And they got themselves
a Gatling gun.
We'll take to the trenches,
Woody.
Here comes the Gatling gun.
I'll get the man some water.
They're robbing us!
-
-
Ahh! Ah!
Whooee! Look it there!
Where the heck
did that come from?
Townsman: That was a shot!
Come from the church!
They're onto us, boys.
Hey!
- Stop!
-
I'll fill you
with a luncheon of lead!
Stop!
Come on, Peak.
Come on.
Shot away the damn loot!
All that for nothing?
Oh, God, my foot!
I think I'm bleeding out!
Well, I'll be damned.
Lookit.
He made it.
Hot damn!
That was right out
of a nickel book.
Glad you could join us, son.
Where to next, boys?
Thank you very much.
Maybe a dust devil
took out the line.
Yeah, it was devils all right.
Five of them.
Run this to Kerrville, son.
Put it in the hands
of Sheriff Eagen.
Tell him to flash it
out all every which way.
Expect you back tomorrow
evening. Be safe.
Why are you
sending that boy out?
Why don't you do it
yourself, Sheriff?
Folks, folks, folks,
just take it easy now.
If I leave outta
here them rustlers
is liable to double back
and hit the savings bank.
My duty's to the safety and
well-being of this here county.
That's right. That's right.
To serve and protect.
And you got a problem with it...
Drop your comments in the box
outside the Sheriff's office.
Oh...
What did you put it in the soup?
Ain't nothing but a clove
or two, Mr. McDonald.
Just finish on up.
Nah, you put
something in this soup.
I know it!
Just relax, Mister.
Yeah.
I know ya put something
in it, dammit!
What is it, you rube? Huh?
Let go of my wife!
Yeah, well, you fetch
My horse right smart. Huh?
No need to kick none.
I'm gonna help ya.
Yeah, well, don't provoke me!
It'll all be over
in a few seconds.
You promised me!
You can't just keep doing this.
Killing people!
I've had enough of
your sloppy mouth!
Clamp it,
before you end up next to him!
What about your sons?
It's no profession, Rudy.
There's other means.
Like what?
Send you back to whoring?
You couldn't turn
a nickel with that
pruned up divorced
cuzzy of yours!
I should've left you months ago.
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
There.
Now there's your mother
to keep you company.
Now you two think
about what you've done!
- Papa!
-
Papa!
Tom: Help! We've got
a hurt man out here.
Claude: Open up the door, Tom!
Hold your horses.
What's going on?
Boil some water up
and fetch some wraps.
This ain't no flophouse.
You can't just barge in here
like nobody's business.
Hot water, bandages now.
And some whiskey, please.
Right away, sir.
And I'll warm up some soup.
Get that chair.
Ah, the big fella looks like he might
need a little extra spice, huh?
- There you go.
-
Haven't I seen your
picture in the paper?
No, sir.
These hills used
to be my haunts.
Maybe we had some
dealings before.
Candy will ruin your appetite.
Yeah, well, stench in here
ain't helping much either.
I'm sorry, boys.
Afraid I've neglected
my house duties
some since my wife's passing.
Ain't you hungry none?
All full up.
Thank you for bringing these
gentleman to my presence.
I ask that you take their hands
and welcome them
to their final destination.
Amen.
-
- Ahh!
What the hell?
What?
What the hell went on here?
Son of a bitch.
The bastard hit me in the head.
I could have sworn last night
I saw him cut off Jack's...
Body burns, same as his soul.
-
-
Brother Scott, did they mention
anything about where they was headed?
Well, no.
One goes by the name of Claude.
The hobbled one called him that.
Claude, huh?
What are the names of 'em
fellas stopped that
Houston Central car
before Christmas, Peak?
Nixon gang.
And they run with a Claude.
Barbee, if I'm not mistook.
Hey, might that be
Sweet Tooth Barbee?
Killed them three
fellas off that train?
Including that
one-armed pig farmer.
There's a pretty penny
on his hide, Sheriff.
You reckon it was him?
How many horses have
we got fit to ride?
Whoa.
Let's duck down here, fellas.
How do you mean?
We gotta keep moving.
We're gonna take to
the background a spell.
We got two dead preachers
wearing our bullets. Huh?
They're gonna have a posse
up our ass any minute now.
Yeah, and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let them
get a downhill pull on us.
Let them blasted
long arms pass us up.
Put some space 'twixt us.
Now come on.
Hyah!
Whatcha proposing now, Tom?
Been studying on
a change of route.
First daylight,
we're gonna make light tracks
right through the heart
of Austin.
Smack dab in the middle
of an army of lawdogs.
Clever.
Why don't we just dally a while,
get our picture made.
It's exactly what they're
not expecting us to do.
Goody: Austin gots steel trees,
high as them clouds.
Light up the town
like ten moons.
Oh, thank goodness.
Friends, do you have any water?
I ran out about a mile back.
Sure, we got a creek down
by camp.
- Where you headed?
- Kerrville.
To deliver a telegram.
Some bummers plundered
a church in Junction.
Is that right?
Killed two pastors.
I gathered them
fresh horses, Sheriff.
Looked in on
Martin's kinfolk too.
- Ain't seen him all week.
- Hm.
That's how come
he's on a bicycle.
You reckon he's run into danger?
Well, if it's the Nixon
gang run through here,
it could be a mess of it.
Oh. Oh.
Imagine for a minute,
we's the ones hauled
in them scalawags.
- Saved that kid.
-
We'd be the prize of Texas.
Hm. Yeah.
Prized with the prize.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking about that reward.
And Martin's
well-being, of course.
Of course.
Best get them horses shod
and fed before morning.
Yes, sir!
I say we take the buggy whip
to him first.
Rub him with honey
and then stake him over
that there ant bed.
Wait, wait! I can be bad too.
You know, like you boys.
Is that right? Is that right?
- Martin: I can!
- Uh-huh.
You hear that?
I don't hear squat.
You with anyone?
See anything, captain?
Shut that puppet up.
War can play cruel
tricks on a man.
- Maybe you...
-
Jack: Whoo-whoo-whoo whoo!
You topers cork it off!
Before you mark every
damn one of us out here.
Go to bed.
Yeah.
Shit!
All right, everybody up!
Martin gave us the slip!
Goddammit, Tom, I told you
to keep a skinned eye on him.
Tom.
Tom?
Boss? Boss?
Boss?
What, he got a fever
or something?
He dead.
That son of a bitch
Martin slit his throat!
Can't be. He ain't got
a drop of blood one.
Ticker must have
just done stopped.
Perhaps a serpent spit
venom upon his bread.
A wicked ebony serpent.
Or a fatherless tramp
with a hand puppet!
Hey!
Now,
I ain't had no count killing.
Everybody just hush up!
Nobody kill nobody. All right?
Tom wasn't exactly no spring
chicken by any stretch.
He just came to the end
of his trail, that's all.
Should I get to
digging a grave, Claude?
Nah, we ain't got no
time for no ceremony.
No telling how long that
courier's been on foot.
You boys gather the horses.
I'll say a few words over him.
Get on the scout, Goody.
And drag Tom by the creek.
Goody:
Well, fix it! Goddog it, fix it!
All right, gentlemen,
Martin is gone missing.
The damn cable's
still on the fritz.
We have reason to believe the
Nixon gang blew through here.
Hear tell they killed 60 men.
I ain't counting pepper
bellies and half-breeds!
Yeah, that's why
we're here today
putting it to you
boys to volunteer.
Now, get deputized
and stand in with us.
Volunteer? To go belly up?
Hogwash!
Volunteer to hunt down
them back-shooting bastards.
Put your name
in the mouths of all men.
Get a little richer
in the process.
Any takers?
We'll go, sir.
That's what I want to hear.
I'm gonna hang a story on them so
we can hole up here for the night.
I don't want any ruckus,
Oh, whoa, whoa, what was that?
You hear that?
Bang, bang, bang,
bang! Bang, bang, bang!
You got me there, buddy.
Denton!
Denton.
Denton, come here this instant.
Sorry.
He's been cooped up all day.
That's all right.
When the cats are away,
the mice do play.
Speaking of, maw and paw around?
William: You say you
gentlemen are cattle traders?
Claude: Yes, sir.
Been working stock out west.
Oh, yes, we've been moving
east for a few days now.
Mm. Pardon my excessive queries.
It's just we've been on edge
since we got wind of a few
unsavories in the area.
They answer well
to your appearance.
Claude: Is that right?
Held up a Lutheran church.
Executed the entire parish.
Imagine that.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Performing tonight,
my sister Mary.
The bestest songstress
in all of Texas.
And yours truly, Denton
Wilberforce, tickling the ivories.
Children, no recital tonight.
These men are jaded.
Well, that's all right.
Been under whip and spur so long
be nice to mix it up with
a bit of a spectacle.
Go ahead.
The eyes of Texas
are upon us
The eyes of Texas
are upon us
Do not think you
can escape them
At night or
early in the morn
The eyes of Texas
are upon us
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Claude: Very nice.
Very nice.
Denton?
Denton?
-
-
Got my mama's jewelry box too,
but she's got the key.
Break that open,
enough in there to probably
pay you back plus some.
Well, you know you're hard
workers and I appreciate that
and it's the least we can do.
Claude: That might
just work out fine.
-
- Did you hear that?
William!
- William!
- Elizabeth?
It's Mary!
She's been murdered!
Where? What happened?
They shoved her
in the necessary like
she was yesterday's refuse!
Our Mary!
You gone absolutely mad?
You're weeding a row
straight to the bone orchard!
What's wrong with you? What's
going on in that head of yours?
You can't keep
doing this kind of stuff.
- Denton: Okay, Pa.
- We ain't never gonna make it
to the coast, you keep
doing this kinda crazy...
Step aside, Mister!
Now!
I don't know who you people are,
but I sensed you were bad company
the moment I laid eyes on you.
The good Lord says not to
judge folks without warrant.
And I follow that word.
Plain fact is
the whole lot of you is just
dregs on your way to perdition.
So I may as well just
do the unchristian thing
and help you along.
Starting with you.
-
- No!
William!
Denton!
She's turning tail, Claude!
That's all right. Let her go.
There ain't no need to
separate a boy from his maw.
Now let's saddle
up those horses.
Dammit.
Oh!
Claude!
You might wanna see this!
What kind of animal done that?
The kind that walks on two legs.
All right,
let's skedaddle, boys.
- Still got the map.
- Hey.
What about the ankle biter?
She'll be back
for him soon enough.
Saddle me up one of his horses.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on.
Check the brush line.
Watch for any movement.
My foot's torn to bits.
This just ain't right for
a man in my condition.
Keep riding, Slap.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Whoa.
Hell, I reckon it
was an Injun, boys.
Probably skipped the reservation,
like old Black Horse back in '76.
Oh, I don't know.
Oklahoma's an awful
long way to come
just to put tail on us.
A ghoulish raven
doth haunt our crusade.
'Sides, ain't no Injun gonna hack
up a easy $50 just like that.
Huh?
Hell.
There's only one way to play
hide and seek with a buck.
Let's draw him outta the bush.
Ready to go to the Lacy to
get your banana peeled, boy?
Really?
Oh! Hot damn!
I never pickled a girl before.
I shalt not darken
the door of a den of sin.
Well, hallelujah, Block!
You can be the rubberneck, then.
All right, let's duck
back in here. Come on.
Denton!
I don't see him anywhere.
Birds done flown, Sheriff.
No sign of the boy, neither.
How many of them
were there, ma'am?
There were four.
One was badly wounded.
The bearded one
took my Mary away.
They claimed they
were cattlemen.
One had a... Had pistols
with ivory handles.
That sounds like
Barbee's hardware.
I know for a fact,
he carries two pearls.
I know it's hard, ma'am.
But can you remember
anything else?
The lame one was outspoken.
He mentioned they were
headed to the coast.
Thank you, ma'am.
We'll find them.
You might want to
check out front, Sheriff.
Come on, let's go.
Get back to whoring
and make me some money.
Go on, git!
All right.
Where's the cash, fat snacks?
Stop those scoundrels!
They robbed me!
Out of my way!
Son of bitches!
Ow!
Hey!
- Move back.
- Townsman: Go get them, Sheriff!
-
- Good job, Willie.
This is the devil's work.
Can't have no part.
We'll kindly commiserate
with Mrs. Wilberforce,
return to the mission,
summon a coroner.
Sheriff, I don't know what
part of hell they're from.
So sorry we disappointed you.
Come on, Peak.
What a dodge!
It was just like one
them Sam Bass yarns.
I tell you what, sure's been
crackerjack riding with you fellers.
That ain't dishwater, but that ain't
gonna get us to the coast now either.
Willie: Ah-hah!
Claude: Good outlaw
never stays satisfied.
Goody: 'Bout time you
loafers done showed up!
Ran into a bit of a
hitch over at K-town.
Keep your eyes on a fix.
Might have a shadow or two.
Goody: You know, they was a whole lot
of chatter in my ears too, boss.
I reckon you's getting more
popular by the day, monsieur.
You ever wonder
what'd it'd be like to
buckle down on some
hard work, Jack?
I ain't talking
about petty thieving.
Talking about an honest trade.
Hell, maybe even
marry a starry belle.
No!
Would you play checkers
with your nose?
Yeah.
Guess you're right.
You hear that?
Same noise.
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed!
Come out with your
hands high, then!
You.
Me.
Willie, grab her horse.
How long you been trailing us?
Since you stirred up
that fracas at the Lacy.
Bastard Bud's been due for
a dust-up for a long time now.
Kinda nice seeing somebody
nervy enough to stand up to him.
Is that right?
And then it got me to thinking.
All those years whoring for Bud and
I got nothing but a curious itch.
So, I started studying
a new line of work.
Outlawing ain't no
place for a woman.
Well, let me be blunt.
You see, I got things
you boys are lacking.
Things that can be
mighty distracting.
Call me Pearl.
Though he was
chained hand and foot
and kept under guard,
he'd broken his chains.
And been driven by the demon
into the darkness.
Jack: That's deep.
Lucky that bell
didn't land you dead.
That sound's making me
a bit tetchy of late.
- Hey!
- Don't mind him none.
He's just checking your mojo.
What's wrong, son?
Get some winks.
I can't.
Not after your horse got
all diced up like that.
Then you be the nighthawk then.
You get tired,
let Blockey relieve you.
Now, go on.
Cut up your horse? Mercy me.
You sure do have a knack for
finding trouble, don't you?
Yeah, well, purty
good at finding me too.
Besides, Injun done that.
Never met one that liked
a pale face anyhow.
But I bet they'd fancy
a little desert flower like you.
Not too hard on the eyes if
you don't mind me saying.
You're not too bad yourself.
A little rough around the edges,
but nothing a fine lady
couldn't smooth out.
If you don't mind me saying.
Not too bad, huh?
That's a start.
So what's a sharp-wit like you running
around with rabble like this?
Doesn't make a lick of sense.
Hell, makes a lot of sense
if you're in a pinch.
These chaps here can sling
lead with the best of 'em.
Pew, pew, pew.
Claude: Might not be much on words,
but that's what my momma's for.
Smallpox took mine.
But I was just a girl.
Yeah?
Mine's barely grown when
she had me and my twin brother.
Got a little weary of
our hell raising, sent us off,
and I haven't seen her
since I was a spud.
That's why I got these though.
Keep her close.
They're gorgeous.
South Sea pearls
from the Outback.
Daddy stole them off
a Mexican in Matamoros.
Made my momma a fine gift too.
Hell, I could buy 400
head of beef with these.
Memory's worth more
than gold to me though.
They're so extravagant.
May I hold 'em?
Let's call it a night.
Pearl: Hm?
Goddamnit.
All right, everybody up!
Tyro fell asleep.
Let's get in the cups, boys.
See what this day brings.
See if Miss Pearl's
worth her salt.
Well, let me just go freshen up.
I don't trust her, boss.
I seen her juju.
Hush up, Goody.
I'm about tired of
your flapdoodle this week.
I never seen nothing like it.
Eyes black as pitch hands
faster than two rattlesnakes.
He worked them two
pearly-handled sixers
faster than the eye could see.
I don't mind telling you.
Grabs two handfuls of candy
and hightails it out of there.
Come the law.
What's all the hubbub?
Sweet Tooth Barbee, that's what.
Where can we have a word
with the Sheriff?
Right over there.
Don't know how much you'll
get out of him, though.
Seeing as he's dead.
Sorry to hear it.
Well, you'd better speak
up if he's gonna hear it.
Ooh, well, well.
What have we got here?
Nice work, Pearl.
All right, Jimmy,
where's the money at?
No, no, sir. I got nothing.
I going to sell these
furs on the market.
And if you catch me on the back
way, maybe I had me some notes.
But luck would have it,
I'm broker than a old
mangy heel hound.
Fact, all I got to my name
is this here 50-cent piece.
- Goddamn, nothing but pelts!
-
Ain't that the trots?
Son of a bitch!
Get a rope!
Strip 'em. Goddamn!
Get his boots up in the tree.
Come on.
I'm just checking to see if you
folks have settled for the night.
Need anything,
don't hesitate to call.
Oh, and by the way, don't
forget to lock your doors.
There's been talks of Sweet
Tooth Barbee in the region.
- Who's that?
- Oh, you don't know?
Well, cable says he's
only the biggest gun
to hit the area
since Bass himself.
Says you'll know him by his spiffy
getup and penchant for taffy.
Watch out though,
people say he's got thin
skin and a hair trigger.
They also say he smells of curry
and has these abnormally,
almost baby-like digits.
He carries these two rose carved
pearly-handled, uh, shooters.
Hey, you might as well
get comfortable, boy.
- Had to do it.
- Shh.
Whatcha got?
Two lawmen just checked in,
looking for you.
Is that right?
Think they might be onto us?
No, but I think you
should warn the others.
Yeah.
Now you thinking like an outlaw.
Size coat you wear, son?
We done told you,
we don't need no damn...
Claude?
Sweet Mary on a pickle!
Anybody need their
boots spit shined?
Ow!
All right, enough of
the grab assin', boys.
Now listen up.
We got a couple
badges checked in.
We hit the saddle at five
before they open their lids.
Comprende?
- Si.
- All right, now goodnight.
All right.
Porter, couple of
coffees, Black.
Right away, sir.
Peak: Barbee's no different than
any other blow hard out there.
Fellas think they're hot snot.
Ain't nothin' but cold...
Not very intimidating
for a road agent.
No, it's not.
I spent all these years trying
to make a name for myself,
and then they go make
a mockery out of me like that.
Should be something
like Claudacious Barbee.
It's got a ring to it, right?
Oh...
Don't pull a long face.
Takes a lot of bark to throw aside
caution in a scrape like that.
The way you handled
that Sheriff.
- Yeah?
- Mm.
I was pretty sneaky, wasn't I?
Mm-hm.
But that ain't gonna
get us to the coast.
What's at the coast?
Is it
legal or illegal?
Oh, it's legal.
Legal tender.
Not that it's any of my affair
but uh, just how legal?
King's ransom legal.
The gang know?
Yeah, they know.
But I got the map.
Hm.
Oh, Sweet Tooth!
Come on!
Left a little love note.
Heeyah!
What in the hell is that?
Mm. Mm-mm.
I've been tied up all night.
And Sweet Tooth
took my clothes and...
Well, he ran off with
your pocketbooks.
Dog-eating, scum-sucking
son of a bitch!
Dammit, Peak! Let's
get out of here.
DJ: I've seen things tonight that a
man wouldn't do to a farm animal.
Whoo-ee!
I sure can't wait to weigh my pockets
down with them riches, Claude.
Oh, I'm getting
my foot patched up,
get me a new finger
and a couple of grade A whores.
Fill the measure of my pleasure
with some whiskey
and women, boys!
Be happier than a pig in shit!
Whoo!
How about you, Block?
I'll walk with Claude
till I'm called home.
All right.
Okay.
Quiet.
Hear that?
You after the bounty?
Show your feathers
you brave bastard, come on!
It's probably just
a lost heifer, Claude.
I got a toy, too! Listen up!
Claude,
We'll flush 'em out
in the morning.
He ain't done us no harm.
Yeah, well, I aim
to keep it that way.
I'm on perch tonight, boys.
Son of a bitch!
All right, everybody up!
Let's go, boys.
We got a map stealing
cunt ahead of us now.
Willie, up!
Jesus Christ.
Damn.
I's told you that
woman had wormy mojo.
But you ain't wanna listen.
Now lookit. She done
took and killed Willie.
Strumpet's as crooked
as the path to Hell.
Now listen.
Now, Pearl might be
a leg-spreading thief.
But she sure as hell
ain't no murderer.
This here's the handiwork
of a renegade red-ass
gone madder than a coot.
Jack ain't looking
too good, boss.
He green as a cucumber
and he smelling like
yesterday's milk.
What? Like hell.
Like hell I am.
All right, Goody,
make a round around the camp.
Curry-comb every niche,
every hollow.
I want you try to pick
up that bastard's trail.
Block, stay here.
Do not leave Jack. Got it?
I'm gonna run in to La Grange,
try to find a sawbones,
I expect Willie planted
before I get back now.
Hyah! Hyah!
Whoa.
A mighty big rattler done that.
You might feel
something down here.
God!
Claude: Come on, Slap.
You're all right.
With this heat, gangrene's
gonna set right in quick.
Now, I recommend he stays off
that foot for at least a week.
Now, I don't know
what transacted...
Week's too long.
What else you got?
I could amputate.
That will work.
-
- Shh.
All right then.
- Claude: Settle down, Slap.
- No!
You ain't loppin' off
my damn tootsie! No!
We gotta get a move on.
Hound's almost had us treed.
Rogue Indian took
out little Willie.
Every minute we burn,
that whore's getting
further and further from us.
But we, I can't!
Come on. I like to kick a hawg
every now and then.
You know that, Claude. Please!
You kick you all the hawgs
you want we get there.
I don't give a cuss. Hell,
I'll even buy you a peg leg.
This outlawing's gone
to your damn head, Claude!
You're all about
the greenbacks now.
Ain't that right,
Mr. Sweet Tooth, huh?
There wouldn't even be any green
if I didn't bust your keester
out of prison, now would there?
And you wouldn't have the goddamn
map if you left me in prison, huh?
I don't have the map, Slap!
That's why we gotta
cut your darn foot off!
Told you you ain't
cutting off my foot.
Man: Much obliged.
You got a right nice town here.
Got that grain, Sheriff.
Oughta get us at least through the
next couple, two, three days.
Good work, Peak.
So what now?
- Dr. Pepperdine, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Please excuse
my appearance, fine folk.
I was hornswoggled by
a group of stickup men.
They were pretending
to be marshals.
You catch any names, Doc?
Yes, I did.
One of them went
by the name of Claude.
Caught that during
an argument over a map.
Before they had
their way with me.
Peak:
He's on the outskirts, Sheriff.
Dr. Pepperdine:
Took my dang shoes.
Townsman: That's Sweet Tooth.
All right, folks.
Doc here just had a run
in with the Barbee gang.
They've given us fits now for
the better part of a week.
They're wanted for a string of
heinous offences, statewide.
We act fast though,
we've got a good shot
at hunting them down.
We're offering a share
of the reward.
Plus a $100 to any man
who'll join up with us
and bring him to justice.
Come on, step up now.
Don't be shy.
I'm no hunter, Sheriff,
but I do have a little secret
might be worth sharing.
You can call me Ruby.
No!
Get your hands off of me!
I'll be damned.
We got him.
Ain't no chieftain
after all, boys.
Well, I ain't got
time for this shit.
Blockey, how about
a Texas slinger?
- No!
-
- Get off of me...
- The Lord shall judge the quick
and the dead.
-
-
- Jack:
- Claude:
Jack:
- Whoo-hoo!
- Good shot.
Barbee, Diente Dulce.
Damn, that sounds
pretty good in Mexicano.
Got a bit of a ring to it.
Ricardo Diaz.
De Rio Rico.
Nah, don't ring a bell.
Good knowing you, Dick.
This is for Willie.
Good night.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, let's push
on through the night.
Nab 'em before
they ever get to Galveston.
Reckon she's just blowing
smoke up our petunias, Sheriff?
Ruby? Nah. She's
real as a rabbi.
I wouldn't put it past old Barbee
sending a pretty gal to slip us up.
She's after a share of that
reward same as you and me.
They could be halfway
to Laredo by now.
I suspect they're after a pile
of that rail job booty
they botched in Houston.
If I was a bandit,
this here stretch of seclusion
would be my sunset route.
Come on, let's go. Come on.
Oh, shitfire!
Why can't we ever ambush
some damn Italians?
Get me some of that
tortellini, huh?
Say, boss?
Yeah.
You sure that pepper
the one pulled Willie's plug?
Hell yeah, I'm sure.
Had a whole family of scalps.
One of them just as straight
and black as Willie's locks.
Well, I ain't taking no chances.
Mm-mm. No.
I'm laying right here
next to this damn fire
so I can see any son of
a bitch come to call.
Click.
You do that 'cause
you on call tonight.
What's in that stuff, Goody?
Jack: Damn.
Goody: Nothing fancy
over here,
Claude!
Holy Christmas.
Even the looniest
shithouse bounty
wouldn't do something
like this, Claude.
No.
He ain't after no reward.
This is someone with some
serious mental shocks.
It might not even
be a humankind.
Blockey: Terror bestows
those who embrace evil.
Maybe we should call it tits up
and head back to New Mexico.
I'll rather be in prison
than Hell.
Not a chance!
We're riding like hellfire till we hear
those waves breaking on the shore.
If this man, animal,
demon, whatever he is,
he wants to go with us,
that's fine.
No skin off my back!
He'll have to wash out each
one of us before I'm left.
You hear that?
I'm calling you out!
It'll be a cold day in hell before
you back down the Barbee gang!
The beans are still
warm, Sheriff.
We're getting' closer.
Ain't gonna be much
to get close to.
There's that circular
mark again.
What you make of it?
Don't.
Seems to favor the dead though.
Let's hope it ain't contagious.
Jack: That old plug's
nearly broke, Claude.
Claude: Hell, Pearl must be at
least 15 miles ahead of us by now.
We'll double up if we got to.
We'll be covering 'em foot loose if
we don't water these horses here.
I mean, look at your mare.
She's spent.
Dammit.
All right, we'll camp
in this field then.
No fire! Not tonight.
And when I return, my stench
will rise in these fields.
Amen.
Don't go too far, Block.
Hey, Jack.
Yeah?
You ever think maybe God's
playing some cruel joke on us?
- How do you mean?
- Hell...
It seems like such a tangle.
Take good time to
fashion each one of us.
Drop us off down here
on this world.
Just to bob around
year after year.
Collecting, wealth,
whiskey, women.
Then He makes some mad hatter
pick us off one by one.
Sticks us out in the middle of this
wheat field, cold, hungry, betrayed.
Just seems a little
sick, that's all.
Well, what if
God didn't make it?
Blockey: Claude!
Ah, hell.
I gotta go check on him.
Stay right here.
- Don't move!
- Ah.
Block!
Who are you?
You after that reward!
Come and get it,
you son of a bitch!
Wha...
How many are you, huh?
Get down! Yeah! Huh, get down!
- What is it?
- Back to back!
Ah, we didn't shake him.
He's still out there.
What was it? Where's Block? Huh?
I didn't see him. Darker than
a well digger's ass out there.
Come on, grab your iron!
Anything moves but the grass,
you plug it in the gullet now.
- Sweet Jesus!
- Ah, just relax, Slap. Come on.
Only man I ever rode with that was
as cool and unmoved as the trees.
Sorry, Block.
Goddamn lunatic did this to you.
You take care of him in hell.
'Cause I'm gonna send him
there right behind you.
- Hotfoot it, Claude!
-
I got you covered!
- What...
- Let's go! Come on!
Hyah.
Hyah!
Come on! Hyah!
Come on, Cherry. Come on.
Hyah! Hyah! Let's go!
Come and get us!
- Halt!
-
-
- Barbee!
He's gaining on us!
Stay on your horse, Slap.
Let's duck down over here.
Dead or alive, Barbee,
dead or alive!
Get in there!
- I know you're in there, Barbee!
-
I have orders from
proper authorities
to effect your arrest
in any manner seen fit.
You're wanted for
the murder of ten men
not including four of your own.
My deputy Peak was among 'em!
Yeah, well, I lay
claim to the first ten.
But I didn't ever touch
a single one of my own men.
Either way,
that's an awful bloody grave
you're sleeping in.
Disgorge, or I'll heat it up
for you in there.
You've come to the end of
your saga, Sweet Tooth.
Time to face the music.
Yeah, well I don't
cotton that song much.
I got one of my own.
You wanna hear it?
Yeah, I'm listening.
Come out stretched, Barbee.
Barbee!
Bastard!
- Barbee!
-
- Son of a bitch.
-
Hyah!
Come on, Jack. I can
almost hear the gulls.
Come on.
Don't hold back
on account of me.
Nah. No, I won't have it.
We're 50-50 now.
We're 50-50.
This one's real deep.
I don't think I'm gonna make it.
All right, now close your
eyes and just bear down.
This is gonna hurt me
more than it does you now.
Listen, just turn your head.
Right there.
They say never trust a man
whose heart ain't been broken.
See, our paws left us both
when we were youngsters.
Maws did everything they
could to raise us right,
but, always had that
emptiness between us.
I sensed it from day one.
Fact is, I trusted you
more than any of 'em.
That's God's honest truth.
Trusted you too, Claude.
But there is one thing about it.
About what, the map?
What do you mean, Slap? What do you
mean there's one thing about it?
The waterhole.
- Waterhole?
- Yeah.
Go on.
Hole...
Tell me.
Look for a piggin' string.
- Piggin' string?
- Yeah.
What do I do with
the piggin' string?
Pull it.
Pull it.
Pull it.
Pull the piggin' string.
Pull it.
Pull it.
Jack.
Jack.
Who did this to you, Jack?
Jack, who did this to you?
Can you tell me?
K, I...
I know. No, I know. I know,
I know, I know, I know.
I know what I gotta do.
I know what I gotta do.
-
-
Come get me, you son of a bitch.
Kid.
You mean to tell me
that we've been
hunted this whole time
by a measly little
pipsqueak runt?
Where's your toy now, huh, boy?
You hear me? I'm talking to you!
You might have marked me,
you little snotnose mongrel!
But I'll be damned if
you gonna cut me up!
See that? Those are flames, boy!
I'm sending you to hell!
Sending you home early!
Oh, you must be Paw.
Already sent your boy
to the fiery gates.
Why don't you stop tinkering
with that bell, go check on him.
You're delirious, Sweetie.
No matter to me though.
Head's worth a year's pay,
crazy or not.
It'd be worth a whole lot more,
only you's a little late.
-
-
I made it, Momma.
-
-
There's two of you?
No, no, no, wait, wait!
Ahh.
You're just a boy.
How can you be so evil?
Twins.
