In September.
On 23.
I met a traveler
come of an ancient land ...
who said: "Two vast
legs of stone ... "
"Near them, on the sands ...
"Lay a face
half-buried ...
"Whose lips
crumpled and wrinkled ... "
Zero.

are free.
Do you women!
Gentlemen?
Let me introduce you
two lovely ladies.
The French name is Sue.
It will supplement your education.
- And this is Annie.
- Good evening.
I need to be educated?
He took lessons
by San Francisco.
You come from far away.
Will you refuse such
ladies? It is an insult.
He has his views on anyone.
There, you?
No, she arrived
in care.
A woman from the East.
They have no type.
I Luif forget.

A cigar?
Vauneen! Come!
God!
Sweetley! Stop it!
What tufais?
What's going on?
He tried to pay me with this.
- It's my bag of gold.
- He lost the card.
I never heard
that Delaney was playing.
That's why he lost.
Lack of experience.
You'd better
introduce you to Mr. Dillon.
Tomorrow at dawn. Get out.
The show is over.
Let it work.
A tour here.
It's coming.
- Why not lock them up?
- No need.
Failure to appear
not Dillon,
they must leave the city.
It is a city clean.
It's good for the company.
And you! Going on.
Sorry, it's mine.
Why not both?
Down the hall,
The bed birds.
We want to treat it.
Have a good week.
Take it easy,
the girls. He is young.
- Where is he?
- At the end of the corridor.
It's been hours
I wait.
Ilfaudra wait.
Have you brought the train into town?
You've missed the boat again, Jim.
Come on, do not mind.
It's true that you will choose
the name of the station?
Give him my name.
- What is your name?
- Sarah.
He'll call Sue, like me.
Sue City.
The railway
is the largest ...
of all American history.
It's not you who selected.
- Ilfaut deserve it.
- No kidding, really?
Yes.
Sorry.
Why it is called Sue?
Because I
fuck you so deep ...
so, so deep ...
that your cock will be found
somewhere in California.
Come here, quick.
That's him.
It's Mr. Dillon.
He, on the horse?
Here, take this.
Give them to Mr. Dillon.
A one else.
How are you?
Hurry up.
I ...
Harry Grimes,
concession Roughwood,
November 30 this year,
have been found guilty
of intentionally ...
racked color and dust
Mr. Delaney gold ...
when he was
drunk and asleep.
I know I was wrong.
I deserve punishment.
The normal sentence
is 50 blows.
Mr. Dillon was transferred to 25 ...
because he knows that this
will not happen again.
The show is over,
guys!
Go home!
Mr. Dillon!
I was told to give you this.
What is it?
This is the part of Mrs. Burn.
Hope you are?
Mr. Dillon.
Burn miss!
- Can I accompany you?
- Yes.
Mr. Dillon is your parent?
Yes, indeed.
Our rich parent.
It's good to have
a parent like him.
Unless he does hunting
with a whip.
In many cities,
this man would have been lynched.
Mr. Dillon has probably
saved his life.
Have you ever seen a lynching?
J'aifailli lynched
myself, once.
- Really?
- A city waiting ...
its railway.
I had to tell them that
pass 25 km to the north.
The idea of ??a rope to the coup
I would change my mind.
But no.
It must be fascinating
to be in the nature ...
with the lynchers, grizzly bears
and wild Indians.
It is.
Can I accompany you?
It's not very pleasant.
I am strong.
I do not slow you down.
- Okay.
- When?
Tomorrow morning.
The path
above the city.
We will return in the evening.
It makes me happy.
Thank you, Mr. Dalglish.
See you tomorrow.
Look!
I Dufeu and eat ...
if you want.
It's pork stew.
I have a bowl.
- Where are you from?
- In Dublin.
- And you?
- In Poland.
Want to drink?
Thank you.
I have not seen a woman ...
long time.
I understand.
- You have found?
- There is no gold in America.
No more gold than elephants.
It provides no pleasure.
A man loses his courage.
Even if it discovers
a pool, he loses.
There's more?
I do not need gold.
I need a woman.
Take that.
- On exchange.
- You do not part with.
I dragged on for six months
on this forsaken land.
I started with two mules,
a cart and luggage.
- I no longer owns it.
- You do not possess me.
The concession.
I give you the concession.
- Daniel.
- Shut up. Let me think.
I take the child as well.
I will be happy.
Want to sell your child?
I'm serious.
This is my breath.
You see how
he clings to coal?
Yes, he has taken.
More slowly.
It warms the outside ...
and when it's hot ...
you pass on your face,
your hands ...
Get warm all day.
Thank you.
- You want good shoes?
- It's OK.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- Tell me if your feet are freezing.
- I come from pioneer.
My father was one.
My mother also.
I was a baby when all
California was like that.
They found gold?
A little.
Not enough.
They never
said as it was beautiful.
It's beautiful.
HowTo mount
a train here?
Ilfautfaire jump
the mountain.
That may be what will be done.
Tunneling.
Can I have
more water for my mother?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Miss Burn?
- Yes?
We have a mutual friend.
A Mr. Dalglish?
Oh, yes.
My name is Lucia.
Enchanted. Mine is Hope.
- It's a pretty name.
- Thank you.
You can call me Lucy.
I came to ask you
from Dillon ...
if you wanted
visit us.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
When?
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.
Whenever you want.
Now, if you want.
I'm not sure.
- My mother ...
- Oh, come with your mother.
- I will ask.
- I'm waiting here.
Okay.
Dillon is below.
I must visit him.
- You too.
- Dillon?
It is below.
- She knows we're here?
- Mr. Dalglish told him.
- Can I go?
- Yes.
Cap up.
- I have no time. She waits.
- It will wait.
Come here.
Do not talk too much there.
Okay? Answer when
it speaks to you.
About Dillon.
Say nothing of yourself.
Do not worry.
I know quoifaire.
Goodbye.
- Where are you, Hope?
- In Boston.
I would go to Boston.
Tonight, Mr. Dalglish will fall
madly in love with you.
I do not think.
- Why would he do?
- Because you will be splendid.
Let moifaire.
We captives.
I tried to do
like San Francisco.
Exactly.
- Let's start.
- Okay.
What do you think of the form?
I've never worn
like it. I do not know.
Here is the skirt that goes with it.
She is so beautiful.
- You can change the lace.
- It will be too big?
We can fix that.
Come on, guys. Move
boxes and boards!
Thank you.
We want to get
before nightfall. Go!
Go on. Keep it up!
Ladies ...
Ladies and gentlemen ...
we have a guest tonight.
A distinguished pianist
you just heard ...
and a famous actress
throughout the Americas.
Hope Burn miss.
There is a gorge ...
- What a beautiful song.
- Thank you.
What was she talking about?
It's a song about
the homeland of my ancestors.
- Portugal.
- You know what?
She has a mole
on the buttock.
The neighbors liked
the charming girl.
Calm down!
All of you!
Continue.
Then one day
a letter arrived ...
with its passage already paid ...
for land flowing
Missouri and Mississippi.
She made her luggage
and everything was ready ...
and a day at the door ...
the widow, the brokenhearted,
separated from her Noreen Bawn.
I'm going to change.
The widow waited
many years.
But one evening through the door,
a slender woman entered.
It was
expensive clothes.
She said: "Mother,
you know me?
"I only caught a cold."
But two scarlet spots
his cheeks ...
told
their sad story.
There is a grave
Old Shooting Connail ...
where the wild flowers
stir gently.
An old woman sobbing
kneeling at the grave.
She said:
"Noreen, you hear me?
"I am alone
since you left.
"The curse
of emigration ...
"Put you there, my Noreen Bawn."
Daniel, stop!
Come!
So, dear youth
and tender girls ...
think before you leave.
Your humble
Irish houses ...
you do not see
that there really.
What gold and pleasure
without his health and strength?
If you are thinking of emigrating,
remember Noreen Bawn.
It's been years ...
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- It was lovely.
- Thank you.
Sing, Dalglish.
- Sing! Sing!
- Oh, no!
- Sing!
- No!
Sing! Sing!
I know this ballad.
I recited
often to my father.
He was still crying at the end.
How was it?
My father?
You are not parents?
Mom said you
are related by marriage.
Oh, Shenandoah
Because I miss you
It's too high.
Again. Again.
- Do it again.
- Right now?
Do you have children?
Children?
Oh, Shenandoah
Because I miss you
In the distance, river flood
Oh, Shenandoah
As I hear you
Away
I am far
I crossed the great Missouri
No.
Stop it.
You are special.
Really?
Very special.
No, you say that ...
and then you go with your big
nitroglycerin box ...
and you never come back.
If I come back.
What are you doing in the hallway?
You have men in there.
The job before the cigarette.
Bellanger. The time has passed.
I want money.
- Annie?
- Yes.
No gifts. Go!
- On the table.
- I know.
- Now.
- Where have you gone?
- It goes well ...
- It takes me another 30 dollars.
Mary, it is not there?
Bring your ass over here.
You do wait.
Going to do your job.
Dillon asked
from you.
What did you say?
You were a researcher
gold and should be wary.
You are very perceptive.
I have to go again tomorrow.
I must consider
the next valley.
You come back?
Yes.
- What are you looking for?
- My turn.
It is there.
It was a good night.
Yes? How?
$ 900 and 4 ounces.
It's good.
One of them pays Annie
for each minute of the day.
- I liked your song.
- Thank you.
Ilfaudrait
watch your man.
- As he looked at the small ...
- I beg you.
Well, it's just a child.
You were a
when he found you.
It Luif
marry an engineer.
I know very well
what I do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Back to work.
I do not think
that you will return.
Of course there is.
I leave luggage here.
And me?
You'll come back looking
your luggage and you will let me.
I'll be back for you too.
You think more
in your luggage to me.
Go to sleep now.
It's going in the room
Mrs. Burn.
At the top of the stairs, right?
It's almost frozen.
It's so pretty.
- It seems not stupid?
- It suits you very well.
Thank you, Mom.
Where do I ask this, Madame?
Oh, that.
Mr. Dillon sent me
you up, ma'am.
I am not a package.
No. I wait for you outside.
Miss.
Mom.
Look at that.
That's it. I will
help you down.
How are you?
- You wait there.
- OK, Dan.
They say you're sick.
I am dying.
Burn died.
It did not leave anything.
I do not want that Hope suffers.
I hope you either.
Coffee?
I want $ 200 a year.
That's it.
If it's too, we can negotiate.
But I want
a written promise.
I no longer drink, Elena.
I want you to know.
I need money.
I need money for Hope.
Does she know?
It's cold here here.
Sweetley you deposit.
Mr. DeWolf.
Mr. Dillon.
Remain seated.
- Hello, Mr. Dillon.
- Open the door.
Oh, Dillon ... my love.
What is it?
A gift.
And that?
The titles of the show.
It is yours.
Why?
We have to finish this.
What are you talking?
It is a comfortable settlement.
You will not ...
I am not a whore!
I do not want.
Tell me why.
- The titles of the tobacco ...
- Stop with that!
- Why?
- It's impossible.
You think I do not know.
It is this girl.
You want to fuck her!
Sort of ... pig!
As soon as one has passed
the mountain, I will leave.
- You will see.
- You always say that.
She has one child.
Annie?
She left him in Sacramento.
We'll get him.
It will not be a life
with a kid.
I will find
a piece of land ...
and I'm going to
build a house.
Bellanger, you are
so full of shit.
You did not sit
since 1862.
I sat down.
Where?
In a brothel in San Francisco.
It is too narrow, boss.
- We will never build here.
- I've seen worse.
Come on, guys.
Bring the nitro.
Cross far.
Go right to the edge.
It peutfaire skip the rock.
Where?
There.
It's good.
Lord God!
Thomas!
"Surely goodness
and mercy ...
"Be with me all my life ...
"And I will always
in the house of the Lord.
"Amen."
Amen.
You can not pass.
You know that.
The train will stop
not to Kingdom Come?
So what?
And Annie, then?
There 's plenty of Annies.
But it is not Annie
you think.
Be careful
where you put it.
Hey, John?
T.J., you ready?
Come on, guys. Walk straight.
Ready?
Fire!
Straighten up and there!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Continues to descend, T.J.!
Straighten up there!
Fire!
Mom.
There is music out.
Mrs. and Miss Burn,
Mr. Dillon asked
the pleasure of your company.
- When?
- Now.
Why?
Dillon wants
tell you in person.
Come on, straighten it!
Ms. Burn ...
I must speak.
Why all this?
I want us to get married.
- We are already married.
- No one knows.
It would settle everything.
You should have all the money
you want.
I have no other family.
Hope inherit after death.
And your little lady?
It has nothing to do with it.
- You did not marry?
- I was already married.
It would be a family again.
I served as his father.
On one condition.
I do not want her to know.
It was not me who would tell him.
We agree?
Okay.
How can you marry him?
I do not understand.
They were never married.
It does not explain
why marry you.
I knew before.
Before Dad?
Before Dad.
Hey, guys!
Engineers are back!
Come on, hurry up.
I hurry.
Hi, Dalglish.
We are waiting for you, you know.
Where is everyone?
At the wedding.
Why not you?
It is the marriage of Mr.
Dillon and Mrs. Burn.
Forward, guys!
I want you to be happy.
I am.
- Are you well?
- Yes.
How are you?
Take care of it.
- Bellanger, just dance.
- I arrive.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Hello, miss Burn.
Good morning.
- How are you?
- Want to dance?
With pleasure.
How did it go?
All right.
It starts quickly.
