Calf on the string.
Calf on the ground.
- Burn him.
- Hot iron.
Pull him.
O'Hanlan.
I'll take the iron.
Old man gave me this
to bring to you.
He said to tell you, you are the first man
that got a letter for a long time.
He's very proud of you.
- Who's it from, John?
- A lawyer. Says on the outside.
- Reckon you're in some kind of trouble?
- I don't know.
I don't know, Harley.
Sure has followed me all over Texas.
All right, you chuckwallers,
come and bury it!
Lookie here.
Look, that spread we worked out
of Del Rio last fall.
You remember that spread,
don't you, Harley?
Seems I recollect that's where I didn't
have a good hold on the jerk line.
Yeah, that's right.
You sure was hell with the hide off
down there in Del Rio, Harley.
I told you before, though, John, I never
knowed she was the headman's daughter.
Ain't you gonna open it?
I'm not opening any letter from a lawyer
on an empty stomach.
I've eaten a lot of good food in my life,
but this weren't part of it.
I heard no complaints
from none of the others.
Yeah, well, they ain't
as well-bred as I am.
All them crumb-castle belly cheaters
are the same.
You name it, and they'll ruin it.
Seems all a man has to do to call himself
a cook is not know anything about it.
It's all part of the same thing.
Sure ain't no life for a man
who appreciates the finer things.
Every year, I tell myself I'll look
for something easier...
...and every spring, I'm right back
at the same old cutting and tying.
I remember when I was about
...he says, "What do you wanna
be when you grow up?"
A damn fool, I said, "A cowboy."
Been making wrong moves ever since.
If I ever get to be a daddy,
I'm gonna tell the little runt...
- Hey, where you going?
- Cheyenne.
Cheyenne? Ain't you gonna give notice
you're quitting?
I did that when I signed on.
You know, John,
I think maybe next Christmas...
...I’ll ride on over to Arkansas
and see my sister.
She's two years younger than me.
Up and married a Breedlaw.
Sam Breedlaw.
He's a chamber pot and pin drummer.
Used to sell horses
till one of them stepped on him.
Sam Breedlaw's brother Lucius
taught me how to make Indian whiskey.
- You know how to make Indian whiskey?
- No, Harley.
Well, take a barrel of Missouri river water,
a couple of gallons of alcohol...
...add some strychnine to make them crazy
and tobacco to make them sick.
The Indian wouldn't figure it was whiskey
unless it made him sick.
Add a few bars of soap
to put a head on it.
Half a pound or so of red pepper
to give it a kick.
Put some tumbleweed in,
boil it till it turns brown.
That's Indian whiskey.
Did I ever tell you
how my uncle Charlie got stove up?
- No, Harley.
- His home sat right out in the prairie.
One day, he went into the outhouse
and got caught in the middle of a stampede.
When he went in, he said there
wasn't a cow in sight.
A few minutes later,
Broke him up something terrible.
That was 19 years ago,
and he's still constipated.
Then there was my cousin Jim.
Sure was a fine figure of man...
...but he went all to pieces
when he got married.
Got fat, his hair started falling out,
teeth went bad.
Worse looking he got,
Better looking she got.
I mean, she weren't no vampire
or nothing like that.
Leastways nobody can prove it.
But Lord have mercy...
...the worse looking he got,
the better looking she got...
...till there wasn't nothing much
left of him...
...and she went off back east somewheres
and took up with a stone mason.
I remember one winter it was almost
as cold as this, down south of Arkansas.
Got to be so cold down there
that winter...
...just about every female in the county
come up pregnant in the spring.
All the following summer
and fall...
...the men and boys was praying
for another cold winter.
"Better than feeding the stock,"
some said.
I was riding in with an old boy
named Hank Jamison.
Had 14 brothers and sisters.
She only had three toes
on her left foot.
- I remember one day...
- Harley.
Who only had three toes
on her left foot?
Hank's sister, Cora Bea.
Cora Bea Jamison was her name.
Folks used to pay her
to take her shoe off.
Married a Styles from over
in Hodge County.
They went around trying to find
a woman with something wrong with her...
...and if they could, they'd marry her.
Take Helen. She had flame-red hair,
pitch-black eyes, ruby lips and no teeth.
But talk about a body.
She could straddle two horses
at the same time.
And I went with her
until I found out she dipped snuff.
Something awful unfemale about
a snuff-dipper, don't you think so, John?
There was always a kind of a crowd
around the Jamisons' house...
...waiting for Cora Bea to come out.
She's Hank Jamison's sister.
She only got three toes
on her left foot.
Harley, I'd like to talk to you,
if you got a minute.
Sure, John.
You've told me that story
about twice now.
Once last week, and then once before when
we were about 500 miles south of here.
Do you know where we are now,
Harley?
- Not exactly.
- We're in Wyoming Territory.
I wouldn't mention it, but you've
been talking all the way from Texas.
- I've just been keeping you company, John.
- I appreciate it, Harley.
And I don't mind it too much
for the first 100 miles.
But, Harley, you've been talking
for 1000 miles.
I'm sorry, John.
You should have told me.
How many more days you figure
to Cheyenne?
Two, maybe three.
If I was you, I'd be a mite more anxious
to get there.
Nobody never left me nothing
in his will.
Well, I just can't figure it out, Harley.
I don't like to say this
about my own brother...
...but he just never was what you'd call
an outstanding citizen.
Truth is, he... Well, he...
He wasn't worth the sweat on
a water bag, that's what he wasn't.
He'd do anything for money.
Where was it he got killed?
It was someplace in Carolina.
After they burned Georgia.
And that's another thing.
The only reason I can figure he went
in the war is he saw a profit in it.
What kind of business
you figure your brother left you?
Well, the letter don't say.
But that's just like a lawyer.
They don't tell you no more
than it takes to confuse you.
But it's...
...something called
the Cheyenne Social Club.
It must be a saloon.
"Jedediah W. Willowby"
- Who's that?
- The lawyer.
You know, Harley...
...I kind of always wondered...
...what it would be like
to be a man of property.
Now step right up, folks...
Lookie there.
St. Louis and New Orleans.
You've heard about it.
You've read about it up for years.
You've looked forward to it.
The ancient remedy from Ireland.
The formula of which I smuggled into
this country at great personal risk to myself.
And now, for the first time in Cheyenne...
...Dr. Foy's Blue Nectar.
It cures warts, opens the bowels,
prolongs life.
Now, don't smile, mister.
I have here today
the living proof of what I tell you.
Mr. C.Y. Yancey.
At the tender age of 8, Yancey contracted
the most horrible and incurable disease...
...the name of which I can't mention
to Christian people.
He began taking this potent elixir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
...Mr. Yancey is 111 years old...
...thanks to the preservative and
the health-rendering powers of Blue Nectar.
All right, Harley, let's go.
The good people of New Orleans
stood in line in the rain...
...for the rare opportunity
of paying $ 1...
...for a bottle of this miracle medicine.
Today, I'm going to let it go
for 50 cents.
Fifty cents a bottle, or $3 a case.
Here it is, Harley.
- Are you Jedediah W. Willowby?
- No.
I'm Mr. Willowby's assistant.
Can I help you?
- No, I wanna see...
- I'll handle it, Potter.
Yes?
Are you Mr. Jedediah W. Willowby,
the lawyer?
- Yes.
- Well...
...I got this letter from you,
and here I am.
- You're John O'Hanlan?
- D.J. O'Hanlan was my brother. Yes, sir.
Well, how is it you're on...?
How is it you're
only now coming?
I wrote this letter
over two years ago.
Well, I'm not too easy to find,
Mr. Willowby.
Took it that long to catch up with me.
Come in. I'm certainly relieved
you're finally here.
Have a seat, Mr. O'Hanlan.
These are the accounts I've kept
since your brother's unfortunate demise.
- Since he was killed, you mean.
- Yes.
Each month, I've taken my fee
out of the business proceeds.
Reluctantly, I might add,
because, frankly, it's not in my line.
What kind of business does it do,
Mr. Willowby?
- It turns a dollar or two.
- No, I mean...
Since I've handled the account,
the profits to this date come to $ 1110.05.
- That's mine?
- This is just a statement...
...to show that the account
was turned over to you in order.
Would you sign at the bottom, please?
Well, you're now the sole owner
and proprietor...
...of the Cheyenne Social Club,
Mr. O'Hanlan.
Well, where is it?
Potter, would you take Mr. O'Hanlan
out to the Cheyenne Social Club?
Mr. Willowby,
I'd like to get cleaned up a little...
...before I take over
my brother's business.
You know how it would look
to folks who come in...
Yes, I see what you mean.
One thousand one hundred and ten dollars
and five cents.
I must have misjudged my brother.
Harley, this is more money
than I ever...
Do you know what I can do
with this much money?
We passed
some nice-looking saloons.
Harley, with this much money, I can...
I can...
I can... What would you do?
If I had that much money
and had a business...
...I guess I'd just live high on the hog
for as long as it lasted.
That's not what a shrewd businessman
would do, Harley.
- You asked me what I'd do.
- That was my first mistake.
Stop it! Move!
Runaway!
Easy, easy.
Give him his head, ma'am.
Just ain't used to that kind of noise,
are you, boy?
Dog-blasted train.
- Tie him up there good, will you?
- Yeah. He's all right now, ma'am.
Why, thank you, sugar.
You hadn't come, that horse
might've been running till the dry season.
I don't know.
Everything takes practice.
Why, honey, you ain't got nothing
going at all for you, have you?
Hope nobody mistakes you for a fence post
and tacks wire to you.
I never been beef plumb to the hocks.
- I eat a good bit, but it burns up fast.
- Well, I'll tell you what you do.
You come to my place, and I'll fill you
to the brim and pack it down.
The best food in Cheyenne.
The Nashville House, right over there.
Yes, ma'am. Nashville House. I'll sure...
That's your boss?
No, ma'am. John's a Texas cowboy come
to Cheyenne for neck meat or nothing.
I just rode along
to hang a rattle with him.
Well, now, don't forget, you hear?
The Nashville House.
And ask for Alice.
How do I look?
You sure are pretty.
You know, l... I even feel like
a successful businessman.
You keep yourself neat and well-dressed,
you have the...
The respect of your fellow...
It goes along with responsibility.
Harley, why are you with me?
John, I've rode with you
for 10 years now.
- I know that, Harley, but why?
- Why?
Don't you see what I'm trying to get at?
Here you've been with me for 10 years,
and I don't even know why.
- How come you never asked before?
- Don't know.
Never thought of about it until just now.
- Does it worry you?
- No.
No. But, Harley, when I got
that letter from Mr. Willowby...
...and told you I was going to Cheyenne,
you didn't say a word. Not a thing.
You just got on your horse
and come along.
You didn't even ask me
why I was going to Cheyenne...
...till we'd been out on the trail
the best part of a month.
It does worry you, John. I can tell.
Well, if somebody had been riding
with you for 10 years...
...and you didn't know why,
wouldn't you wonder about it?
Well...
- Pardon me, miss.
- Yes?
Could you direct me
to the Cheyenne Social Club?
How dare you.
- What did I say?
- Too much, I reckon.
Hey, where's the Cheyenne Social Club?
Right where it's always been.
Across the tracks.
- Last place you come to.
- Much obliged.
There it is, Harley. There's my business.
It don't look like no saloon I ever seen.
It ain't what you call
"centrally located," is it?
Hello. Welcome
to the Cheyenne Social Club.
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.
I ain't seen you two around before.
- Beg your pardon?
- I'm Jenny. Who are you, honey?
Oh, my name's John O'Hanlan,
this here is Harley Sullivan.
I've come up from Texas
to take possession of...
O'Hanlan?
Are you the late D.J.'s brother?
Yes, ma'am, I sure am.
Did you know D. J?
Know him? Why, bless your heart.
I hope to tell you I knew him.
I was his favorite.
Come on in,
I'll introduce you to the other ladies.
Excuse me, which ladies are these?
Why, your ladies, of course.
Oh, now don't you worry
about a thing, honey.
Every single one of us
was handpicked by D.J. personal.
Ladies, guess who's here.
Harley, you don't suppose?
I mean, you don't think this is a?
You don't believe it, do you?
Do I what?
Nothing.
Just an idle thought.
D.J.'s brother?
"Ring for service.
Sara Jean, one ring.
Pauline, two rings.
Opal Ann, three rings.
Carrie Virginia, four rings."
- I can tell you now.
- Tell me what?
That question you didn't ask me
about that idle thought.
You shouldn't stand out here
like poor kin, honey.
Go on into the parlor
and make yourselves to home.
You too, Mr. Sullivan.
Any friend of the late D.J.'s brother
is a friend of ours.
- Miss... Mrs...
- Oh, it's "miss," honey.
Well, Miss Jenny, I'm gonna have
to ask you a question right here and now.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...
Tall just like D.J.
Ladies, this is the late D.J.'s brother.
- John, ain't it?
- Oh, John. Yes, ma'am.
This is Miss Annie Jo.
John O'Hanlan.
We are so happy to have you here.
Miss Carrie Virginia.
I'm just so delighted.
Miss Pauline.
So nice to make
your acquaintance, Johnny.
Miss Opal Ann.
Charmed, Johnny.
I'm just all breathless. I...
Miss Sara Jean.
You're just gonna love it
here with us, Johnny.
Well, that's your inventory, John.
We're just one big happy family.
I reckon you'll wanna say
a few words to us, honey.
Just to get things started off right.
You know that the late D.J.
was a stickler for organization.
Ladies, John has a few words
to say to us.
Well, ladies, I...
It's kind of hard for me
to tell you this...
...but I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding somewhere...
...down along the line.
- That's you, Pauline.
I...
You see, when...
When l... When l...
You see, when I first heard
that my brother...
...the late D.J.,
had remembered me in his will...
What l... What I mean is, I got this letter
from a lawyer here in Cheyenne.
And all the letter said was that the...
All the letter says is that my brother,
D.J. O'Hanlan, had left me his business...
...here in Cheyenne.
It was a thing called
the Cheyenne Social Club.
- And...
- Sorry.
And it...
It was a thing called
the Cheyenne Social Club.
I thought it was a saloon.
- I thought it was a saloon.
- Six is me.
- Jenny, Jenny.
- Sorry, Johnny.
Things sort of pick up this time of day,
and that sundown bell just keeps a-tinkling.
It's that little old sundown bell that has to
do with everything I been trying to say.
Johnny, why don't you say
your speech at breakfast.
That's the quiet time
at the Cheyenne Social Club.
- Who says I'm gonna be here for breakfast?
- Sure you'll be here.
- This is your home now, honey.
- Home? No...
I want you to understand
one thing, Jenny.
I may not be much,
but my folks were fine, upstanding people.
Johnny, I gotta go.
That's my sweetie just come in on the 6:15.
- Jenny.
- Harvard man.
- You'll sleep in D.J.'s room.
- But...
We kept it just the way he left it.
- Top of the stairs. First door on the left.
- But, Jenny...
This place is busier
than a Kansas City stockyard.
- Your brother?
- That's D.J.
- He favors you.
- Only in looks, Harley.
Only in looks.
- You coming?
- Where are you going?
Up to my room.
Your room.
- What are you looking at?
- You.
Why?
I don't know.
You look different somehow.
What do you mean, different?
John, it's kind of hard for me
to put my finger on.
Well, try, Harley. Use them all.
Well, you just ain't the man today
you was yesterday.
Leastways, not from where I stand.
Well, maybe you're not standing
in the right place, Harley.
What do you...? What do you mean,
"I'm not the man today I was yesterday"?
Just like you lost yourself when you took
a bath and bought that new suit of clothes.
- Lost myself?
- Ladies and all, running a place like this.
Now you... You can just stop right there.
I'm not running a place like this.
- What you gonna do, John?
- There's nothing else I can do.
I'm gonna have to fire them all.
Tomorrow morning at breakfast.
Where did you get the cigar?
Drunk give it to me when he went in.
Said he had a new baby.
You know, worthless
as my late brother was, l...
I just can't understand
how a man can live here and like it.
They don't seem like
such bad ladies, John.
I run more to boarding houses.
Where folks pay their board and room
and that's it.
I'm going down to the Great Plains Saloon
to get a drink of whiskey.
You coming?
Thought you didn't want me with you.
I didn't say that.
I just wondered why you are.
You know, this is the first time in my life
I've ever been able to walk into a saloon...
...without having to wonder
whether I can afford it.
It's a good feeling.
Barkeep, we'll have two base-burners.
- Did you say two?
- That's right.
- Scotland, Ireland or Kentucky?
- Oh, Kentucky.
- New in town?
- The name's O'Hanlan, up from Texas.
Wait a minute.
You D.J. O'Hanlan's brother? The one that's
taking over the Cheyenne Social Club?
- Yes, I am, but...
- Well, welcome to Cheyenne, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Whiskey's on the house to you.
- Hey, hey.
- That's mighty nice of you.
Don't mention it.
D.J. drank free here...
...and, well, I got along all right
at his place.
Mae, this here is D.J. O'Hanlan's brother.
I want you to take real good care
of him, you hear?
- Like you did D.J.
- Yes, sir.
All right, boys. Let's move it.
- Why?
- What for?
For D.J. O'Hanlan's brother,
that's what for.
Well, sure.
Glad to meet you, Mr. O'Hanlan.
I'd do anything for D.J.'s brother.
- Let me shake your hand, Mr. O'Hanlan.
- All right, boys. That's all.
- Let me shake your hand.
- Hope to see a lot of you.
- An honor to know you.
- This was D.J.'s favorite table.
From now on,
it'll be permanently reserved for you.
Anything you want, you just ask for it.
After we get to know you better,
you won't even have to ask, it'll be there.
How do you like your beefsteak,
Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Beg your pardon?
- Your beefsteak.
D.J. always used to send me out
for a beefsteak for him.
He liked his rare.
Oh, well, well, I'll...
- I'll have mine well-done.
- Well-done. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
You want a beefsteak, Harley?
Well, thank you, John,
but I ain't too hungry just now.
I think I'll just muck around town a while
and see what I can see.
- Are you coming back?
- Well, I don't know, John.
Popular as you are, it makes me kind of
skittish just to be close to you.
- Mind if I sit down?
- Not at all.
Not at all.
- Here, have a cigar?
- Never use them.
Here you are, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Now, anything else you want,
you just give me the look.
Thank you, Mae, thank you.
You know what I don't like about you?
You and them women of yours
think they're better than everybody else.
I was out at that place of yours once.
She insulted me.
That one called Jenny?
The way she acts, you'd think
she was the Queen of England.
She said I smelled bad.
Wouldn't even let me hold her hand
unless I took a bath.
Well, did you?
- Did I what?
- Take a bath.
You must be soft
between the head-handles, mister.
This here territory is
full of women...
...you don't have to smell like lilac water
to get next to.
I'll bet that's the dying truth.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll eat my beefsteak.
No, sir.
I don't like you at all.
Hello, Slim.
- I see you found me, huh?
- Couldn't hardly miss you.
Oh, some think I'm fat, maybe,
but it's not so. I'm just well-rounded.
Gives a man something to hang on to
in the rough country.
You might be on the plump side, Alice,
but I think you're kind of pretty.
- Do you really, sugar?
- Sure I do.
Don't go counting on me
for nothing colorful.
I used to be a real cedar-breaker.
Now I'm just bringing up the drags,
looking for a gut-warmer and a salt-lick.
I bet if I opened up the gates
you'd come out a-stooping, huh?
Might at that.
Well, come on over here to a table,
let me introduce you to some hot grub.
Here, honey, you sit right down here
and keep Dr. Foy and Mr. Yancey company.
I'll send some whiskey over
on my way to the kitchen.
- I'm Harley Sullivan.
- Dr. Michael Foy.
My longtime friend, Mr. C.Y. Yancey.
Oh, Mr. Yancey doesn't shake hands.
Germs, you know. Nothing personal.
You staying here in town?
Cheyenne Social Club.
- You mean, you live there?
- Moved in today.
They tell me you need a character reference
to get past the front door of that place.
It's what you might call "high-toney."
All imported stock, so they tell me.
The best in the West, so they say.
Hey, Slim.
Sink your teeth into this, honey,
and you can ride the high range this winter.
Mind if I ask,
why you staring at me?
Why is he staring at me?
He likes you.
If he didn't like you, he'd leave.
Are you...?
Is he really 111 years old?
He sure is. And he never felt better,
thanks to Blue Nectar.
Mr. Yancey, how many bottles of Blue...?
How many bottles of Blue Nectar
you figure Mr. Yancey drunk in his life.
Oh, 10 or 12,000 bottles or so.
And look how steady his nerves are.
Yeah, they are kind of steady, ain't they?
Need something?
- Anything more, Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Well, I'll tell you, Mae.
You just might give me
a little taste of that Irish whiskey now.
Slim, I think you and me could make
the sparks go if we worked at it a little bit.
Well, Alice, it makes me proud
that you think so highly of me...
...but I wouldn't...
I just wouldn't know where to begin.
Let alone finish.
You said you thought I was pretty.
And I meant it, Alice. I really did.
You mind not?
Will you tell him to stop staring at me?
Mr. Sullivan, you're not being
very respectful to an old gentleman.
I definitely think
it's time that we parted ways.
Let's go, Mr. Yancey.
We have a long day tomorrow.
- Mr. Yancey.
- He's drunk.
He ain't drunk.
He's dead.
What? Hey, you two, come on.
Go take this man out of here.
Slim, l...
I don't want you to let this upset you.
Alice, I'm plumb out of flint.
- How you doing?
- I never felt better glued-together.
What do you say we walk back?
I tell you, Harley,
as soon as the ladies are all gone...
...I’m gonna have a business
as solid and as respectable...
...as Bullion's Dry Goods Store.
Solid, solid, respectable...
...Republican business.
That's what makes America, Harley.
My folks were Democrats, John.
And look where it got you.
A lifetime on the range,
and sweating in the summer...
...and freezing in the winter,
and sleeping on the ground...
...and fighting the wolves
and the rattlesnakes.
No, no, Harley.
There can't be a finer calling
in the whole world...
...than being a Republican businessman.
I don't like to dispute you, John,
but didn't you always vote Democratic?
Well, that was when
I didn't know any better.
Harley...
...I want you to do me a favor.
Don't tell anybody here in Cheyenne
I ever voted Democratic.
- You'll do that for me, won't you?
- lf you say so.
- Thank you.
- John.
You don't mind
if I still vote Democratic, do you?
Just so long as you're not seen with me
when you do it. It'd be bad for business.
Oh, rolling stone.
Hooray for Cheyenne.
She didn't... No question.
- I tell you, Harley, Cheyenne has to be...
- Good night, Johnny.
Oh, good night?
Carrie Virginia.
Good night, Carrie Virginia.
I tell you, Cheyenne
has to be the friendliest town...
Johnny.
Oh, good evening, Jenny.
I waited up for you, John...
...because I didn't want you to go to
sleep tonight without knowing how I feel.
It's just...
Well, it...
It's so good to have you here.
Well, already I feel like
I've knowed you for years and years.
And it makes me all warm inside
just knowing you're in the house.
Just across the hall from me.
I hope you feel the same way...
...knowing I'm close by.
Yeah, Cheyenne's gotta be
the friendliest town in the West.
Did you ever in your whole life
see anything like it?
Sure ain't. Not even in Texas.
Well...
I always did this for the late D.J.
I was his favorite, you know.
- Thank you?
- Opal Ann.
Why, how sweet of you
to remember.
You know,
you wouldn't look bad at all, honey...
...if you scrape off some of the topsoil.
- What's this?
- Just what it looks like, Johnny.
D.J. always had a glass of warm milk
with a raw egg in it before he went to bed.
Claimed it kept his strength up
and helped his complexion.
It wasn't his complexion I cared about.
Well, if I can do anything else for you,
I'm just down the hall.
Third door on the right.
You expecting company?
I just wanna look my best in the morning
when I talk to the ladies.
When you tell them
what you gotta say...
...it ain't gonna make no difference
how you look.
And he was bragging about how much
he could drink without feeling it.
Well, I said, the only reason he couldn't
feel it was he was numb to begin with.
- Come on, John.
- Good morning, John.
- Good morning, honey.
- Sit here, honey.
Thank you.
Your brother, the late D.J., always liked
to have coffee with us in the morning.
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.
Hi, hi.
I just wanted to tell you ladies what
I didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday.
Why, sure, Johnny. I'll just call Opal Ann.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Opal Ann.
Opal Ann.
- What is it?
- Come on in.
Johnny's got something to tell us.
Y'all go on. I'll get the edges.
I'll be thinking about you, Harley.
I'll be thinking about you too, Opal Ann.
- Want some sugar, honey?
- No, I'll just take it like it is.
The late D.J. just loved sugar.
- He was quite a man.
- He was, huh?
- He sure was.
- He liked the best of everything.
He did...
Hi there.
Well, ladies,
I'd just like to say that...
John, before you say
whatever's on your mind...
...do you mind if I ask you a favor?
Why, of course. What is it?
Do you mind if I take off
for a month or so?
I wanna go back east and visit my boy.
Your boy? You mean, you have a son?
Yes. You see, he goes to military school
in Virginia and doing right well.
I ain't seen him in two years.
Oh, well, that's perfectly
all right with me.
Let's see. You're?
- Annie Jo.
- Annie Jo. Annie Jo. Yes, that's...
Why, the truth is,
it couldn't come at a better time.
Oh, that's so wonderful kind of you.
Because I'm closing the house
until I can decide what to do with it.
What did you say, John?
I said I was closing the house, Jenny.
I'm closing down.
You mean you're throwing us out?
Oh, I wouldn't put it in that way, Jenny.
- Well, just how would you put it, honey?
- Listen, this just isn't my line.
So I'm gonna lock the place up
until I can figure out what to do.
I don't know.
I may open a boarding house.
- I don't know yet.
- And what'll happen to us?
You can go somewheres else, can't you?
There must be a million...
You're not the late D.J.'s brother.
The late D.J. had a heart.
- You...
- Well, you don't have to...
You...
Jenny, will you tell the ladies for me...
...that I didn't mean that they had
to get out right this minute.
I mean, they can have
all the time they want to pack.
That's right big of you, John.
- You tell them that for me, will you?
- Why didn't you wait till Christmas Eve?
Harley!
Did you tell them?
I told them.
Well, what they say?
They're not talking to me.
Too blunt, John.
Bluntness is a flaw in a man's character.
If a man wants to get somewhere,
he's got to be what they call "diplomatic."
I mean, if a man wants to reach
one of them shady way stations...
...along the torturous, spine-busting
road of life, he can't be blunt with folks.
John, you're nickel-plated, but you can be
rougher on folks than an Indian haircut.
I'm not saying
you're bored for the hollow horn, but...
...sometimes you leave folks
with the taste of gone-bad pooch...
...you know what I mean?
I mean, some of the words
I heard you put on folks...
...I’m surprised you ain't been brought up
to a stiff rope and a short drop.
Well, is there anything else?
Well...
Yeah, John,
there is one other thing.
I was wondering if you could see
your way clear to loaning me some money.
You don't have to if you don't want to,
but I thought since you got so much...
...you might see your way clear to...
First, you deliver the sermon,
and then you pass the collection plate.
I didn't go for you to take it like that.
How much money do you want, Harley?
Fifteen or $20 ought to do me.
- And what do you need it for?
- Things.
- What kind of things?
- Just... Just things.
You know,
like a drink of whiskey if I wanted...
...or a new shirt or something.
You already have two shirts.
You don't wear but
one at a time unless it's winter.
There you go,
thinking like a Republican again.
Yeah, well, you don't bring up politics
while you're borrowing money, Harley.
It ain't seemly.
The ladies don't understand.
They asked me to find out for them.
Find out what, Jenny?
What we did to cause you
to hate us so much.
- Jenny, I don't hate you.
- You don't love us.
- Can't you understand...?
- Why, we took to you right off.
Opal Ann even remarked...
...how you was distinguished-looking
and gallant.
All I'm trying to tell you is...
- Opal Ann said that?
- And handsome.
She say that too?
"Handsome and well-stood-up,"
them was her words.
- I appreciate... Thank you.
- What do you do?
Why, you stay one night,
and you just throw us out.
Why there ain't a lady
in the Cheyenne Social Club...
...that wouldn't do
anything the world for you...
...you being the late D.J.'s brother
and all.
But we just loved his heart.
We just loved him to death.
- Jenny...
- Smothered him with affection.
Turned down his bed at night,
polished his boots.
- Don't cry.
- Trimmed his nails.
- Jenny, please.
- Sat up with him when...
Will you stop crying
and listen to me?
Now, some men
are just cut out for one thing...
...and some men
are cut out for something else.
- And my brother...
- D.J.
D.J., he must have been a master
at what he did.
I mean, he must have been a real beauty
at what he did.
But I'm cut from a different bolt of cloth.
Burlap is what you're cut from.
- I was just trying to...
- lf the late D.J. was here...
...he'd take care of Pauline.
Now, what's she gonna do with her liver?
- Her liver?
- Poor Pauline.
What about Pauline's liver?
The late D.J. never came into my room
without knocking.
He was a gentleman.
I declare...
- Pretty, ain't it?
- I've seen some beds in my time...
...but I never... I can't... I just-
I can't find the words to...
It just kind of grabs you, doesn't it?
I had it custom-made. Solid mahogany.
Ivory rollers, goose-down mattress
and Swiss springs.
What's that?
- Spurs.
- What?
Well, with a bed like this,
you could set up as a museum.
That's what I may be doing,
thanks to you.
Well, now, what is all this
about poor Pauline's liver?
Don't know what they call it,
but it's something terrible.
If your brother was alive,
he'd see she got it fixed.
The late D.J. took care of us.
Well, how much money does she need
to get her liver fixed?
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars for a liver?
That's what the big doctor
in Chicago charges.
He's got all kinds of fancy letters
in the back of his name.
I don't care what he has
in back of his name.
Five hundred dollars? That's more
than you have to pay for a good horse.
I told you you didn't care.
Pauline, l...
I wondered how long
it was gonna take you.
I beg your pardon?
I was D.J.'s favorite too.
Well, Pauline,
I've come to give you something.
I'll just bet you have.
I've heard it's better to give than receive,
but I'd a lot rather receive.
Yes, you take this.
Pauline, I want you...
I want you to take this.
Just put it on the dresser, honey.
Well, now, Pauline,
you don't understand.
I want you to take it and get on the train
and go to that doctor in Chicago.
You know, that liver doctor
that Jenny told me about?
That doctor with all the letters and things
in back of his name?
Bless your thoughtful heart,
John O'Hanlan.
That's just the nicest thing
anybody's ever done.
Pauline, I don't want to be blunt...
...because bluntness
is a flaw in a man's character.
And, Pauline, you're... You're sick.
Yeah.
You don't care what you step on,
do you, Harley?
Are you comfortable, Harley?
Like I've died and went to heaven.
Come on in, John.
Harley, I wanna talk to you.
- What about?
- Business.
Well, does it have to be now?
What do you want me to do,
Harley, make an appointment?
Oh, all right,
don't go getting on your high horse.
I'll be back.
What do you want to talk about?
Harley, I don't think they believe
they really have to get out.
I mean, I haven't seen
one of them pack or anything.
Are they talking to you yet?
Well, yes, Jenny's talking a little bit.
Pauline, she...
I mean, Pauline's talk...
But that's what bothers me.
I thought it bothered you
when they weren't talking to you.
It did, but now it bothers me
when they do.
Just like when I was married.
That's right, because when they start
talking to you...
I never knew you were married.
John, it ain't something
I like to talk about...
...but I was married once,
and once is enough for any man.
You can't smoke, chew, dip, drink,
scratch in the parlor or cuss.
Leave the house,
they ask where you're going.
Come home, they ask where you been.
And right now, with you,
it's just like when I was married.
Well, how is that, Harley?
Well, John,
when a woman's talking to you...
...you can be pretty sure
she thinks she's in control.
When she's not talking to you,
you can be pretty certain you're in control.
And you think I'm not in control now?
- Do you?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, what do you think?
John, I don't understand
your problem.
What more could you ask for
than what you got now?
You got money, a fine house,
all them friends.
Here you follow me
all the way up here from Texas...
...and now you can't even
be a little help.
- I'm trying to, John.
- You know what your problem is, Harley?
You just don't understand anything.
Nothing Harley. Just nothing.
Somewhere along the way, you just faded
right out of the big picture of life.
John, you just ain't got no right
to talk to me like this.
- You just...
- We've rode together too long.
- All right, go on in there with?
- Opal Ann.
Opal Ann. Go on.
You've changed, John.
You really have.
Ever since you come
into fame and fortune.
Good evening.
Hi.
Let me have a drink of whiskey, barkeep.
- Better drink somewhere else, O'Hanlan.
- What are you talking about?
We were doing all right here in Cheyenne
till you showed up.
All I want is a drink of whiskey.
What's the matter?
I've heard tell of some mean ones in my life,
but you got them all beat, O'Hanlan.
Yeah, what did those ladies
ever do to you?
I bet you'd foreclose
on widowers and orphans, wouldn't you?
Well, stranger, I don't see
it's any concern of yours what I do.
I ought to have your butt kicked is what.
- And would you like to try it?
- No. Not in here, you don't.
You gonna give me a whiskey,
or ain't you?
Try the Lady of Egypt Saloon, O'Hanlan.
Only, if you're thirsty,
don't tell them who you are.
We sure don't need
the likes of him around.
Ought to set up as a preacher
is what he ought to do.
John.
- Can I buy you a whiskey?
- That's mighty kind of you, Mr. Willowby.
I was hoping somebody
would offer me a drink before bedtime.
I believe you've met my associate,
Mr. Potter.
- Hello.
- Mr. Clay Carroll, Mr. John O'Hanlan.
- How are you, sir?
- The pleasure is mine, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Mr. Carroll is a lace and button drummer.
Occurs to me the two of you
might do some business together.
What kind of business are you in,
Mr. O'Hanlan?
Well, the fact is, Mr. Carroll,
I'm not really in business yet. I just...
O'Hanlan is hiding his light
under a bushel.
He owns the Cheyenne Social Club.
So you're that O'Hanlan.
- Is something wrong?
- What...
Mr. Willowby,
will you explain to him that...
Not many men would have the guts
to close down a historical monument.
What historical monument is that,
Mr. Carroll?
Your Cheyenne Social Club,
that's what historical monument.
The Cheyenne Social Club is a...
It was there when there wasn't
a railroad for 300 miles.
It's withstood prairie fire and Indian attacks.
And the first ounce, O'Hanlan...
...the first ounce of gold
discovered in this territory...
...was spent wisely and well
at the Cheyenne Social Club.
And you...
...you come up here from Texas
and close it down.
Well, now, Mr. Carroll, I didn't figure
I was doing anything all that terrible.
The fact is, where I come from, it'd be
considered something of a public service.
You don't say.
Yes, sir, I do say.
You must come from a part of Texas
that I ain't heard of.
I have a feeling
you mean something by that.
Sure, I mean something.
You Texans are just like little birds.
All mouth and full of...
Mister, you just drawed on
an inside straight.
Gentlemen, now, gentlemen,
we can settle our differences... Not on...
Oh, that was beautiful.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Hit him! Hit him! Come on!
I got a nice place here.
Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan!
If you're looking for Harley,
he's busy right now.
- Well, where is he?
- He was with Carrie Virginia a while ago...
...but him and Pauline have
struck up an acquaintance now.
That Harley. He's like a bad outlaw.
- Just keeps moving from place to place.
- Mr. Sullivan.
Mr. Sullivan?
Mr. Sullivan!
You calling me?
Your friend Mr. O'Hanlan
is in a terrible fight.
You don't say.
Yes. It's a terrible thing going on
up at that saloon...
...and he needs help.
Why?
He's outnumbered something terrible,
Mr. Sullivan.
- What are the odds?
- Well, it must be five, maybe six to one.
And you figure my weight
might make the difference?
Well, you are friends.
Mr. Potter, friends should stay
out of one another's business.
John wouldn't appreciate me interfering.
I hear you got John O'Hanlan locked up.
- You a friend of his?
- That's right.
- You come up here from Texas with him?
- Sure did.
That was a bad move.
You can have five minutes.
What happened, John?
Harley, you'd think
I was closing down the Alamo.
Well, I knew from the start
you wasn't gonna have no easy time of it.
Folks just don't like it when you start in
attacking public institutions.
- John, I just think your trouble...
- Harley, Harley, would you just forget it.
Just how... How are the ladies?
Doing real fine, from what I can see.
- Any of them packing yet?
- No sign of it.
There must be some way
to get those women out of there.
Would you tell Mr. Willowby
I'd like to talk to him?
He's still in the doc's office.
- I didn't know he was sick.
- He weren't till you started that fight.
He was met in the face by a piano stool,
so they say.
I hear that saloon looks like
it was in the path of a buffalo stampede.
All for a good cause, Harley.
All for Texas.
Three hundred and twelve dollars
and ten cents.
Now if everybody's satisfied,
I think I'll be on my way.
Just do me a favor, O'Hanlan,
stay out of my place.
The unfriendliest town
I've ever come across.
People insult you
or don't talk to you at all.
Can't get a drink.
Mr. Willowby, I wonder
if I could have a little chat with you.
Oh, Mr. Willowby, you just look terrible.
A piano stool did all that, huh?
I heard you got your jaw hurt,
but nobody said anything about that.
That's just the worst-looking eye
I have ever seen, Mr. Willowby.
I remember a fellow down in Texas...
...he bent down to tie his boot lace
and got kicked right in the face...
...by a 20-year-old mule named Hattie.
Lost every single one of his teeth
right there on the spot.
But I believe, if yours
was compared to his, you'd win out.
Well, I know you're a very busy man,
Mr. Willowby...
...so I won't take up
too much of your time.
But, you know, I've always wondered...
...what it would be like
to be a man of property.
And now I know.
And it feels good.
Why, for the first time in my life,
I feel like I'm really somebody.
You understand what I mean,
Mr. Willowby?
By golly, that's a terrible looking eye.
Well, anyway, I suppose you've heard
I'm letting the ladies go.
And what I'm thinking about doing...
...is making the Cheyenne Social Club
into a boarding house.
You know, with meals and singing
in the parlor on Saturday night.
And songs like "The Old Gray Mare"
and "Hanging Out the Linen Clothes."
But my favorite
is "The True Lover's Farewell."
You know that one?
I forget how that goes.
That's it. That's my favorite.
As soon as I change over
and all the ladies are gone...
- You can't do it.
- How's that again, Mr. Willowby?
It's the Cheyenne Social Club or nothing.
I don't think I'm following you.
It's the agreement your brother had
with the railroad.
What's the railroad got to do with it?
It's my house.
The house is yours, but the house sits
on the railroad right-of-way.
- Mr. Willowby...
- It's simple, O'Hanlan.
When the railroad was buying up land for
its right-of-way, your brother sold to them.
Like everybody else, he wanted the railroad
in Cheyenne, but with one provision:
That the Cheyenne Social Club
could stay just the way it was...
...as long as the girls were there.
Benefited everybody.
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.
Mr. Willowby, are you telling me
that I don't really own it?
You own the house.
- As long as...?
- The girls stay.
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.
The house goes.
Well, it was nice chatting with you,
Mr. Willowby.
John. I'm glad you're finally here.
- Where is everybody? They all leave?
- Up in Jenny's room.
I sent for the doctor.
Is Jenny sick?
She get beat up, John.
Real beat up.
Looks bad. She's...
Well, she's been asking for you.
Oh, honey.
You know, something, Johnny?
No, just don't try to talk, Jenny.
The doctor is coming.
All my life, l...
I've liked people.
Even...
Even...
...people nobody else liked.
- I...
- I know.
But nobody's got the right to...
...do this to another person.
- Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Yes.
I'm Dr. Carter.
I came as soon as I could.
- Get her well, doctor.
- I always do my best, Mr. O'Hanlan.
I think she'll be all right eventually,
but she's in bad shape.
She has bruises over 40 percent
of her body.
Three broken ribs, some sprains
and maybe some kidney damage.
It's too early yet to know.
- You just make sure she stays in bed.
- Yes.
I'll examine her in the morning.
Good night.
Good night.
John.
- Who did it to her, Harley?
- Wait a minute, John.
Who did it to her?
John, you ain't no hand with a gun,
and I ain't neither.
- I wasn't here when it happened.
- What's his name?
Opal Ann says his name
is Corey Bannister.
Did she mention
where he could be found?
John, you know
you can't draw worth a penny.
- Where, Harley?
- Great Plains Saloon.
John.
John, can't we talk about this
before you go to doing something rash?
- What do you want, O'Hanlan?
- The man that beat up one of my...
One of my girls.
They tell me his name's Corey Bannister,
and they tell me I can recognize him...
...by a streak of yellow
down his back.
I'm Bannister.
- I figured you were.
- Well?
Ever hear about what we do down in Texas
to a man that beats up on women?
Suppose you tell me.
We drag him through cactus.
No cactus around here.
So I noticed.
Just like D.J. would have done.
How you feeling, Jenny?
Honey, just like I've been stomped on
by a bad bull.
Well, doc says to get some soup into you,
so that's what we're gonna do.
Did you ever love a woman, Johnny?
I mean, really love her?
Yeah, thought I did once.
Come to find out it was indigestion.
You won't believe it,
but a man once loved me.
Oh, he was a real good man too.
He went to Oregon.
Was gonna send for me.
Got shot in Portland.
I cried and cried.
It was really me I was crying for.
When I was young,
I had all sorts of dreams.
- Something awful sad about an old dream.
- Yeah, I know.
When I was a boy
down in the panhandle...
...that was before I slipped my hobbles,
I was a real star-gazer.
I tell you, Jenny,
I dreamed and I planned big things.
And then I started drifting.
Been drifting ever since.
Come on, come on.
Have some more soup.
- Goodbye, honey.
- See you later, Carrie Virginia.
- Hey, that for Jenny?
- Sure is.
- How is she?
- Doing real good.
You're not doing so bad yourself,
are you, honey?
I suppose you've come to see me
about that little thing last night.
That wasn't any little thing you did,
O'Hanlan, that was a Bannister you shot.
I've been wanting to do it for years.
- You haven't come to arrest me?
- I come to warn you.
When you kill one Bannister,
Oh, you mean, some of his kin
might come here for me, huh?
You can chisel it in granite.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
My advice to you is to grab onto the tail
of the first horse you see traveling south.
- Go back to Texas, you mean?
- Still there, ain't it?
Makes no difference to me, but them
Bannisters is meaner than tiger spit.
Can't I count on any help from you?
Oh, I have to go to Medicine Bow
for a prisoner.
But whatever you do,
do it like you mean it.
Well, how much time do I have?
Three days at the most.
They live quite a ways out of town.
But trouble rides a fast horse.
What do you suppose we should do,
Harley?
What do you mean "we," John?
You could wait around
and help me out, you know.
I said it before and I'm saying it again:
Neither one of us
is any hand with a gun.
I did all right last night, didn't I?
John, I don't want to hurt your feelings...
...but Corey Bannister is probably
the first man ever killed by a pecan.
What are you talking about?
John, how much of that inheritance money
you got left?
A dollar or two,
after I pay the doctor for Jenny.
Mr. Willowby says you can't open a
boarding house or anything else, didn't he?
What's your point?
You got exactly what you come
to Cheyenne with. Nothing.
I still don't get your point.
There ain't nothing keeping you here.
Come on back to Texas with me.
What kind of a man
are you anyway, Harley?
You've been riding with me
for 10 years, and I don't even know you.
Do you think for one minute
that my late brother D.J. would go away...
...and leave these ladies
to face the Bannisters?
Well, do you?
Well, do you?
I don't reckon he would, John.
It don't make any sense
staying to meet them Bannisters.
You get hurt that way.
I don't wanna get hurt.
I ain't yellow, but it don't make any sense
at all in begging for it.
Old John will probably be
outnumbered 10 to one.
Ten to two don't make it any better.
- You're sure she's gonna be all right?
- Yes, she'll be fine.
But she shouldn't exert herself too soon.
- You mean get out of bed?
- No, that isn't what I mean. I mean...
Let me put it this way, Mr. O'Hanlan:
- She shouldn't receive visitors for a while.
- I get you.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.
Seen your smoke,
smelled your coffee.
Can you spare a cup?
Get down and sit, mister.
I reckon you fellows have a herd
somewheres abouts?
No.
You wouldn't be coming from Cheyenne,
would you?
Sure am.
- You got a name?
- Harley Sullivan, headed for Texas.
Heard they had a little shooting
in Cheyenne?
Sure did.
You see it?
- I was there.
- O'Hanlan must be some hand with a gun.
No, he can't draw at all.
You say he can't?
Makes out all right with a rifle
if he's got lots of time...
...but when it comes to pistols,
well, you can forget it.
It's plumb pitiful.
Well, it sounds like you know
this O'Hanlan pretty good.
Well, as anybody, I reckon.
I don't understand him,
but I know him.
You fellows headed for Cheyenne?
If this O'Hanlan is as bad
at drawing as you say he is...
...how was it he outdrawed Corey?
Did...?
- Did you know Corey Bannister?
- I'm his uncle.
Uncle?
- And these here fellows, I reckon, are...?
- Cousins.
Thank you for your coffee.
If you ever come to Texas,
look me up.
I wouldn't have said it right to his face...
...but wild horses
couldn't drag me to Texas.
All right, mister,
get up against that wall.
- What did he do to you?
- He didn't...
I ain't done nothing, Mr. O'Hanlan.
- Tell him, Carrie Virginia.
- Well, then why are you crying?
- I'm so happy.
- You're happy?
Pete asked me to marry with him.
Nobody has ever asked me
to do that before.
It's true, Mr. O'Hanlan,
I did ask her.
And before she started crying,
she said I'd have to ask you.
- Ask me what?
- For her hand.
I'll talk to him outside.
l... I'm just so proud.
I know you are, Carrie Virginia.
I know you are.
- Your name Pete?
- Pete Dodge.
- You love her?
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Do you go to church?
- Yes, sir.
Every Sunday morning,
right after I leave here.
- Will you promise to take good care of her?
- Sure do my best.
That isn't what I asked you.
Yes, sir, I promise
to take real good care of her.
All right, Pete, I'll tell Carrie Virginia
you asked me for her hand and I gave it.
Thank you, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Just where do you think you're going?
- Well, I was gonna go...
- After the wedding, Pete.
- After?
- After.
Well, but you don't seem to understand.
- You see, we've been seeing each other...
- After.
After.
Maybe we should go out there
and give O'Hanlan some help.
No. D.J.'s brother won't need no help.
He might even be insulted.
Oh, well, I'll stay right here, then.
I sure wouldn't want to insult him.
You sure are something, honey.
Most men, if they knew the Bannisters
were coming, would be fidgety.
I'm only fidgety
when I'm not certain, Pauline.
This time I'm certain.
I don't stand a chance.
I never knew a man so modest.
Johnny, you got enough guts
to fill a smokehouse.
Bravest bull in the barn.
Fred, Seph,
get out there behind those ties.
When he shows himself,
get him.
O'Hanlan, come on out!
All right, ladies, everybody upstairs.
Now, Johnny, don't get yourself killed...
Keep down, honey, and stay inside.
Stay in your rooms till it's over.
Hey, O'Hanlan, come on out!
We're gonna have us a party.
I'm sorry, I don't like crowds.
Oh, you'll like us.
We're the Bannisters.
Everybody in this territory
likes the Bannisters.
That's why they seldom kill one of us.
I ain't coming out,
and you ain't coming in.
And that's the way it's gonna be all day.
All together.
If one of us can get inside,
we've got him.
Go on.
What are you doing?
The doctor said...
Honey, after all you've done for me,
the least I can do is load for you.
You in there, boy?
Call out!
He's in here.
Jed, you run pretty fast,
don't you, boy?
I make out.
Give your cousin Jed cover.
- Give it all you got, boy.
- I aim to.
- Is that you, Harley?
- It's me, John.
- You all right?
- Just fine.
Harley?
Harley?
Texas.
Harley Sullivan.
Harley Sullivan!
Uncle Charlie!
I knew you could do it.
Because I'm D.J.'s brother?
No, honey.
Because you're you.
Congratulations!
Right this way, gentlemen.
Right this way.
I heard you were coming, so I went ahead
and ordered your beefsteak.
Hey, Mae.
All right, boys, that's enough.
That's enough, boys.
Thank you. Thank you.
- I'll buy you a drink later.
- Whiskey's on the house.
- Thank you.
- How lovely to see you.
Oh, hello, Mae. Thank you.
- I'll get your steaks right away.
- Thank you.
Well, I declare...
Harley, why'd you come back?
John, you think I'd really left you?
- You mean, you didn't?
- You ought to know me better than that.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Just the way you like it.
Where did you go?
What difference does it make?
I was there when you needed me.
You thought I was scared
of getting hurt, didn't you?
Well, I have to tell you the truth,
Harley, I did.
I did, and I apologize
for misjudging you.
I thought you'd know me better than that,
after all the years we've rode together.
It just goes to prove
you never really know a man...
...until the chips are down
and you need him most.
I appreciate you helping me out.
I never knowed it before, John...
...but a good gun fight
sure makes a man hungry.
Hi there.
Thought you'd wanna know, Ray Markstone
just rode out of town to get his family.
I expect the town will fill up
with them before the end of the week.
I don't believe I've ever met anybody
by that name, marshal. Who are they?
Blood kin of the Bannisters.
And they're coming
to see me, are they?
No, I suppose they're coming
to see both of you.
- Then I think I'll head on back.
- Just a minute, Harley.
How many Markstones are there?
Oh, 60 or 70, I imagine,
up in the Jackson Hole country.
Maybe another 50 or so
here and there around the territory.
Well, I just wanted to warn you
before I leave town.
You won't be here when they come,
marshal?
Oh, I'd like to be, O'Hanlan.
I really would. But I have to ride
to Fort Laramie to identify a prisoner.
Well, good luck.
Busy as he is traveling, it's right decent
of him to take the time to tell us.
It's hard for me
to say this, Mr. Willowby...
...because I have just come
to like the ladies so much...
You know, Jenny and the others.
Nice ladies, all of them.
But this Cheyenne Social Club
just isn't my kind of a thing.
What with the money lending
and the saloon fights...
...and the doctoring
and the gun fights.
Let me speak for Cheyenne,
Mr. O'Hanlan.
Cheyenne is grateful.
There's some talk of running you
for mayor next election.
Do you know, that first day
when I left this office...
...I thought all my dreams
had come true.
- Great.
- Yes, sir.
When you're out on the range with nobody
to talk to most of the time but your horse...
...you do a lot of dreaming.
And I dreamed
of being a man of property.
But, you know... You know, Mr. Willowby...
And I didn't realize it then...
...but I have always been
a man of property.
I have my horse.
I have my blanket.
I have the whole West to ride in.
How could a man own
more than that?
No, I...
Mr. Willowby, I'm a cowboy.
Always have been.
And I know now I always will be.
What are you gonna do?
Well, me and Harley's going back
to Texas.
And I want you to transfer
the Cheyenne Social Club to Jenny's name.
- Now, Mr. O'Hanlan, are you certain...?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, I want Jenny and all the other ladies
always to have a place they can call home.
Very well. I'll see that it's done.
Thank you, Mr. Willowby.
I appreciate it.
Well, I guess it's time to go out
and say goodbye to the ladies.
I reckon so.
I don't know what to say
to them, Harley.
What would you say?
- Goodbye?
- That's all?
You walk in and say goodbye
and walk out?
What's wrong with it?
Well, for one thing, Harley,
it's downright rude.
And for another thing, it's blunt.
Well, John, you asked me, and I told you.
What else do you want?
Nothing, Harley. Nothing.
Ladies, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this...
...because I didn't know
it was gonna come to this.
Oh, there's that bell.
I'm sorry, honey.
- You go right on with what you're saying.
- Well, I haven't said anything yet.
Well, anyways, I had a little chat
with Mr. Willowby, you know...
Sorry, Johnny.
Well, I had this little chat
with Mr. Willowby, the lawyer?
You know?
And what he's gonna do is...
Oh, now, hold on here, Carrie Virginia.
I gave you away.
I told that fellow Pete Dodge
you could marry him...
...and for him to stay away
until after the wedding, didn't I?
Oh, I know, honey.
And Pete is staying away too.
He is? Well, who is...?
Oh, that's just Edgar,
coming to pay his respects.
Edgar? Who's Edgar?
Pete's brother.
They're such a close family.
Close?
Close family?
What did you want to tell us, honey?
- What?
- You were saying?
Well, I guess all I really wanted
to say was goodbye.
- Are you going somewhere?
- Well, l...
That's me.
- We're alone at last.
- What?
It's the first time
we've ever been alone.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Why, everything, honey.
- Opal Ann, all I wanted to say was...
- I know.
You wanted to say
that I'm your favorite.
Sacrifice. All I do is sacrifice.
Well, I guess I better go up
and say goodbye to Jenny.
Jenny, I just came up
to say good...
Goodbye, Jenny.
Reckon when you said goodbye
it kind of tore them all up.
Harley, you would have thought
I was dead.
Calf on the ground.
Hot iron!
Burn him.
O'Hanlan!
This come for you.
All the way from Cheyenne.
Thanks a lot.
Who's it from?
- Jenny.
- Hey, Sullivan, give us a hand over here.
What she have to say, John?
Oh, nothing much.
- Why didn't you let me read it?
- Well, Harley, I just didn't think you'd care.
O'Hanlan, Sullivan,
go run them calves out of that dry wash.
John, I liked them ladies
just as well as you did.
- I didn't say you didn't, did I?
- But you didn't even think about me.
- Will you just let up?
- Can't you tell me what Jenny had to say?
Just things. Just...
The trouble with you is you don't think
about other folks' feelings.
- Harley, come on.
- I'll tell you what.
It's ungraceful and indelicate
not to let me read Jenny's letter.
- Harley, if...
- You're an old bull-windy bunch-quitter.
All ewe-necked, feather-headed,
stubborn like Colorado mockingbird.
I never in my life heard anybody go on
so much about a scrap of paper.
You ain't heard the first of it yet.
John, you ain't learned yet.
You can't treat people
just any old way it pleases you.
I remember a man from Denver once...
- I don't wanna hear about the man from...
- You're the spitting image of him.
He never thought about another soul
for a moment.
Nothing but downright selfish
is what he was.
If he got a letter, he'd have done
just the same thing.
If I ever get a letter from the ladies,
I'll let you read it.
That's because my heart's
in the right place.
Yeah, Harley, I saw in Cheyenne
where your heart is.
- What do you mean by that?
- You think on it a while, Harley.
John, all I'm trying to say is you should be
more thoughtful to your fellow man
I just want you to leave me alone,
Harley, that's all.
- You could wear a man down to nothing.
- Yeah.
