Somebody out there?
Who?
Who's out there? I got a gun by me.
That you, Medford?
- Who's that?
- Matt Weaver.
Weaver.
You stop right there, Weaver.
Don't you come no closer.
You crazy?
- What are you doing here?
- Doing? This is my farm.
No more, it ain't.
I'm warning you.
- This is my house.
- No more, it ain't.
- I bought it. From Sam Brewster.
- Brewster?
Yeah, Brewster.
After Grant mustered us out.
Why, this ain't been your house, Reb,
for pretty near three years.
Now, you start walking off my land
and keep off.
Welcome. Welcome home, Señor Matt.
Home? It's been stolen out from under me
by this thieving town.
My house is yours. A roof over your head.
I aim to sleep under my own roof.
- What's going on here, Billy?
- Matt Weaver.
Weaver?
He's got a gun.
He's heading for Brewster's.
Tuttle! Hey, Tuttle! Tuttle!
- What's the rumpus?
- The Reb is back.
- It's the Reb?
- Tuttle!
- Hey, Tuttle!
- Yes? What?
- Matt Weaver's here.
- Jumping Joseph!
Headed for Brewster's.
With a gun?! Wait for me!
- Crane, what is it?
- He's as big as life out there.
- Matt Weaver.
- What?
- I'll put a bullet through him.
- Crane, please.
And end my nightmare for good and all.
- Crane, you're drunk.
- Don't say it.
Don't you ever say it.
Oh, God!
Brewster! Open up, Brewster!
Brewster, open up!
Brewster!
Brewster, open up!
It's the Reb, sure enough,
pounding on Brewster's door.
- Let's hurry!
- Brewster!
Brewster, I'm coming in.
Come on down, Brewster,
or I'm coming up!
Weaver!
Stand clear!
Crane!
- Ruth.
- It's between me and him.
- You got him in the arm.
- I aimed for his Reb heart.
Your performance
is never up to your intentions.
Ruth, take Crane home.
Welcome, Sheriff, welcome.
Now that you're here,
is it in your capacity to arrest this man?
- He broke into my house, tried to kill me.
- Kill?
- I came here to ask about my farm.
- To ask?
Ask and it will be given thee,
but with a rifle in your hands...
Matt. Come on, Matt.
Sheriff.
Matt, get a hold of yourself.
Put Brewster out of your mind.
You're trying to take on a whole town,
not one man.
Old folks and womenfolks and Mexicans,
a couple of cripples like Crane,
that's what this town is.
But you come back on your own legs,
swinging your own arms,
seeing out of both your eyes.
Well, I found my daddy.
In Tennessee.
It was my daddy, all right,
but his head was shot off.
So, er... I picked up his rifle.
Picked up where he left off.
And I stayed to the end.
The end. Now it's over.
The war's over.
- Not here, it ain't.
- No, sir.
Not while Brewster can keep it going.
He said Medford bought my farm
from Brewster.
Well, how did Brewster get it?
How did Brewster get it?
When they auctioned it off, nobody
had any ready cash except for Brewster.
- Anted up just to keep things legal.
- Legal?
Legal? We was mustered out
to return home.
Articles of surrender
didn't mention confiscation.
Hey, boy, you just lost a pint of blood.
You quiet down.
So Brewster picked up my farm cheap,
sold at a profit to Medford?
Just widows and old folks dying off,
and who's picking up their leavings?
You get out of this town, boy.
Comes morning, you're still here,
pick up your gear and walk out of here.
Keep walking. Never come back.
- What's the holy racket?
- Church summons.
- On Tuesday morning?
- Funeral for John Medford.
Crazy Reb killed Medford
out at his farm last night.
This is the meetingest town.
- How long is the stop here?
- In Pecos, no longer than I can help.
Quarter-hour, maybe.
Our good reverend, Father McMichaels,
has given me leave
to speak a few words
over the body of my friend and yours.
A Union hero of Apache Canyon.
One of the few to return to us
from that valley of death.
May John Medford's soul rest in peace.
Amen.
Peace for John Medford,
but not for us, my friends, not yet.
This morning, we woke up to find
that we've got still another widow
in a town
that's already got more than its share,
and she was widowed
by a Reb, Matt Weaver.
No, the war is not over for us, friends.
This confederate soldier -
he's still in uniform, mind,
still bearing arms -
invaded this township,
broke into my house, broke out of jail,
if you believe our good sheriff.
And in the secret places
he did smite to death an innocent.
I put it to you,
how do we smite this enemy of the Lord?
Now, listen here. You listen here to me.
I brung the first wagons in.
I can bring this rebel boy in to stand trial.
I got to bring him in.
We're not forgetting what you done
when you was able, you old warhorse.
We won't send you out
to get cut down by a crazy Reb.
Suppose you tell us
what you're working us up to.
Lacking a posse
or a sheriff able to do the job,
come to me, we could call on
the US Marshal in Santa Fe for help.
Except the US Marshal's got a territory
full of looters and Rebs to clean up.
They got a backlog a year long.
But we can't wait a year. We can't wait
a week. Business will go to pot.
How many more
can Matt Weaver widow in a year?
I hear you, Mr McKeever,
so I'm digging into my own pocket.
I sent Crane Adams to Amarillo
to hire a lawman
able to flush that Reb out of these hills
and end this war we thought was over.
A lawman, Mr Brewster?
Crane went to find a gunfighter.
A gunfighter kills the man he goes after.
No trial, no jury.
Guilty or innocent, he kills him.
- Are you asking us to believe...?
- I'm asking you nothing, Mrs Adams.
Women don't vote here.
You turning this funeral service
into a meeting, Sam?
Well, I've got a vote.
And I'm asking you, are you saying
we're not gonna hear Matt's side of it?
Dispense with
the whole due process of law?
How many here besides me lost sons?
Hands! Hands!
How many here lost husbands? Hands!
Due process of law, Barker, in wartime?
Until every last murdering Reb
lays down his arms, it's still war,
and we got a new widow in our midst
that needs our help.
Stint not, brother. Stint not. Give.
Give and it shall be given unto you.
All aboard!
You paid through to Santa Fe.
Found you a little life, huh?
Don't look for it to last.
Giddup!
How did it go?
Medford's gone for good
and Weaver's good as gone.
I'll take over.
You sure you want this side of town?
Mexican town's just over the wash.
You'll be a sight more comfortable here.
Billy, take Mr...
Take the gentleman's bags
up to number five, front.
Staying long, Mr...?
You knew I'd open for that signal.
Well, who's out there? Crane? Who else?
Nobody's out there.
I came here to find out for myself.
Did you kill John Medford?
Well, I went crazy.
I tried to scare him off with bullets.
Well, old Medford come out
with his hands up.
To talk, he said.
No guns, he said, so I put down mine.
He got close and pulled this.
He missed and I didn't.
Ruth, I swear that's what happened.
If I believed you, what difference would
it make? The whole town is after you.
I know.
Five weeks walking here, Ruth.
And now I get here and...
Ruth, I'm tore up.
Not just Medford.
You and Crane, how could you marry?
If you ever came back,
I wanted to be sure
that I wouldn't be waiting for you.
Well, you fixed it sure, all right.
You never believed that I cared that much
about men buying and selling other men.
You wouldn't let yourself care.
You didn't love me enough to stop doing
the one thing that could finish us for good.
- I told you I had to go find my daddy!
- That is not why you went!
You went because
you're pigheaded like your father.
Because you couldn't do like the rest
if it killed you.
Matt.
Yell at me again. It feels real homelike.
You were such a mean, stubborn boy,
it was the only way I could make you listen.
I used to wonder if you'd ever grow up.
And you never did. Hold that.
I grew up, but you're right,
I never was much on reasonableness.
And having my farm stole out from me
doesn't make me any more so.
You never were
and you never will be.
I'm glad I didn't wait for you.
Are you happy with Crane?
Crane left town yesterday.
He went...
He went to find a gunfighter.
Gunfighter? To fight what?
To fight you.
Brewster.
It'll take Crane a week.
If you leave now, they'll never find you.
That's my mother's grave out there, Ruth.
I planted them vines on the porch.
I live here till I die.
Sooner or later, however long I live,
I'll fight the town for the right to die here.
Now you answer me.
You happy?
Happy?
This is the house
I was going to live in until I died.
You planted vines.
I knew where I was going to plant roses.
I loved you.
I loved you so much
that now I hate you
because you're a thief, Matt.
You stole yourself away from me
for nothing.
For nothing.
You stole my rightful life away from me.
I got a half-dollar
says he's a skinny runt tied to a big gun.
Them skinny runts get handy with a gun.
They got to, you know.
Wait here. I'll go find Brewster.
Dancer.
Let me through.
Let me through, please.
Mr Brewster, this is Mr Dancer.
Good morning, sir.
You one-armed toad! Drag me 100 miles
in that hearse for what?
For nothing!
Your brain's rotten with booze.
- Mr Brewster...
- Can't you do nothing right?
I sent you after a gunfighter.
What did you come back with?
How do you find a gunfighter?
You don't go to church.
You go to a saloon.
Saloon keeper says the top gun
is a fella by the name of Jewel,
but he had to move on
and now we're using Dancer,
so I tell Dancer we're paying $300...
And you pay his coach fare here,
and where is he now?
Here. He's here. Jewel.
- Where?
- There.
- Your name Jewel?
- No.
The hotel register.
My name is...
Jules...
Gaspard...
D'Estaing.
Jules... soft J, silent S.
Gaspard... silent D.
D'Estaing... just a touch of diphthong.
Touch of diphthong?
Well, try Jules.
Jewel.
That J is still a little hard.
- Try this. Zzh.
- Zzh.
No. I'm just gonna call you,
if I need you, Jewel.
Step along to my office now. I'll find out
soon enough if I'm gonna need you.
How many steps?
Right down the street here to the bank.
The bank... where the money's kept.
Too hot.
You a gunfighter?
We got a little problem round here.
It's quite a story. Quite a story.
- There's this Reb...
- Where?
On this farm he owns.
Just a short ride out of town.
Horseback ride?
I stay off horses.
Well, I guess you could walk it.
I'm not much for walking, either.
I'll take care of your Reb. $500.
I am not Dancer.
I will take his $300 on account.
Now.
There... in your breast pocket.
The banker's sweating.
My hotel room's cooler.
After the time you've wasted for us,
you'd better pray
this Jewel's what they say he is
and does what he says he'll do.
That's two things I'm settling right now.
- I'm back.
- I put your coffee on your desk.
What I want to hear
is how you're going to earn your money.
- With a bullet in his back, no doubt.
- In his...
What I am talking about
is you're here, and he's out there.
Now, you won't ride.
You won't walk.
He will have to come to me.
He can't work a farm under siege.
He's been shooting his food.
Every sunup
we hear his rifle cracking away.
Weaver's always been a dead shot.
Not with an empty rifle.
Now, where would a man
buy or steal bullets in this town?
The emporium.
Suppose I'm tired of this hotel room,
and the emporium might seem
more... homelike.
Not hardly. The Adamses live upstairs.
Crane might, but Ruth...
The way you walked into my room,
I'd say you owned the hotel.
Wouldn't surprise me if you owned
a piece of every business in this town.
I own more than a piece
of the emporium. I can tell you that.
So you see, I have more faith
in your powers of persuasion than you do.
I'll put it to Crane. If a man
know not how to rule his own house...
Is he a man?
Yes, sir.
Catch Weaver red-handed stealing.
That is a cut above a bullet in the back,
you got to admit.
Hear you held a town meeting
the other day. How did they vote?
Who?
- Mexicans?
- Don't vote.
Live here.
Around about. They go their way,
we go ours. Two separate towns, like.
- And farmers?
- Work our farms if they want to eat.
- Don't eat much.
- Don't need much. They're different.
I can see
how you could afford to go Union.
We went Union
because we're against sedition and slavery.
And sin.
All but one die-hard Reb.
Well... let's close him out.
- Ruth! Mrs Adams, this is Mr Jewel.
- Yes.
Well, Crane,
I brought you some business, boy.
A bit out of your line, maybe.
I got a boarder for you.
A boarder, for a couple of days.
Mr Jewel don't fancy the hotel much.
- We don't take in boarders.
- First time for everything.
- We don't take in boarders. Ruth!
- I'm putting it to you.
- What's Ruth got to do with it?
- The work.
A woman's work is never done
in a boarding house, I'm sure.
I've been meaning to take a long look
at these books of yours, first chance I got.
Crane, boy, you can't afford
not to take a boarder.
You'll find Mrs Adams here
sets a nice table.
You heard. You'll be doing the work.
If you don't want him here, speak up!
- Well, that's all settled.
- Yes.
- I'll be on my way now.
- If you'll show me the way.
Certainly.
Oh. A spare room. Means room to spare.
- It was never a question of room.
- Yes, just the company.
I do hope you don't find me
too troublesome.
And what if I do?
Isn't it easier to keep an eye on me here
than from your front steps?
It's Crane's.
He... played beautifully.
Sleep well, my child
Silvery dreams be thine
May happiness
Illume your way
Comme dans chaque vie
Bien qu'il soit tôt ou tard
On dit qu'il faux qu'il tombe
un peu de pluie
French! That was French.
- You French?
- Creole.
Creole?
New Orleans?
Born in New Orleans?
It's funny.
Don't you see the joke?
Joke's on Brewster.
We hired a Reb to kill a Reb!
Born in New Orleans, but no Reb.
- Union?
- No.
Well, now...
Let's just hear how you managed that.
- Managed to be in Mexico.
- Sat it out. Slacker, eh?
Reb or slacker,
which makes you feel better?
Nothing can make me
feel better about you. Put nothing past you.
Know what I think?
I think you're lying straight through.
- Creole? I say you're Mexican.
- Crane.
I'll tell you what I am and what you are.
I am a man with a gun, and you're drunk.
Please go.
Good night.
Deuces wild.
I'll open with a dollar.
- I call.
- I'm out.
A dollar... and raise you 15.
I'm out.
- Call.
- Out.
Light.
Cards?
Two.
One.
One for the dealer.
I bet 25.
Out.
and 25 better.
I call you, dammit.
Beat four aces!
Five kings.
Show 'em!
Four kings... and a deuce.
No deuce.
- Five kings.
- You...
What? What's this?
Never dealt a hand like that before.
Never seen such a town.
Nobody challenges the deal.
Brewster's trained you.
Mr Tuttle will collect for me.
I'll come by for my money tomorrow.
Your own hired hand, and you're
letting him thieve you and walk away.
Jewel! We hired your gun.
Might favour us
with a sharpshooting exhibition.
Tomorrow, maybe?
Fancy shooting exhibition
tomorrow night. Bring your friends.
Crane?
Don't tell me
the boarder made it home first.
I heard shots. They woke me.
Just a little gunplay in the saloon.
Nobody hurt.
Gunplay?
Guns are playthings to you?
Play and work, Mrs Adams.
Work and play.
Tell me something. The truth.
I never lie.
I...
I have this feeling that you...
that you are playing with us, all of us.
And...
that you really don't intend to do
what you've been paid to do.
Is that a question or a request?
I'm not sure.
Maybe both.
First smile.
First in a long time.
Much longer since I've laughed.
My mother used to scold me
for laughing too much.
Is that why you stopped?
My mother died, and my father.
When the war reached us here,
I don't know, one day I stopped laughing.
You were not born here.
New England.
In a white town in a green valley.
I wish we'd never left.
This came from New England
with Crane's family.
Nothing good
comes from the savage South.
I'm not one of those Northerners
who despises the whole South.
We knew a family here that...
Well, a Southern family.
They were wonderful people.
Warm, kind, happy.
Your second smile.
You didn't answer my question.
Will I do what I have been paid to do?
What would I gain by answering it?
Well, your second smile
was your last for a while.
I'll answer your question.
I'm in business for money.
And pleasure, too.
A town that hires a gunfighter is always
a henhouse with just one rooster,
a few fat capons,
a few clipped wings.
What happens
when a man with a gun walks in?
That's play, Mrs Adams. Fun!
When the fun is over, I'll pull the trigger.
Where does Crane go at night?
Why does he drink?
What is Matt Weaver to Crane?
What is he to you?
Tell me.
Was Crane a whole man
before he lost his arm?
Are you a whole woman?
- Always this hot in Pecos?
- Hm?
Hot? Oh, it'll get much hotter
before it cools off... in winter.
We have snow in winter.
Mr Guthrie used to say
it's either burn or freeze in Pecos.
The late Mr Guthrie.
Are those fresh flowers?
Oh. Yes. They're from my garden.
May I?
Thank you.
- I want to buy a horse, Mr Kenarsie.
- Buy?
Recollect you saying something
about staying off horses.
Until I have to get on one.
Keep it here and saddled up
for the next 24 hours.
I hear you. Knew we could look
for a little action soon.
Well, er... Let's see what we got here. Ah.
Here's a goodie. Yes, sirree.
Here, boy.
There's a steal. $30.
Who is stealing from whom? Four hours'
ride and this horse will go lame.
You got a pretty good feel
for a horse-shy city fella.
Let's see. What else we got here?
You've got nothing here but that.
No. That sorrel ain't for sale.
I nursed him up from a colt.
Ride him myself.
I wouldn't sell him for gold.
- $30 in currency.
- No. I wouldn't sell him.
I can't allow you to cheat yourself,
Mr Kenarsie.
$30 when I take him out.
He's worth 200.
Now saddle him up and keep him saddled.
Matt! Señor Matt!
Cornmeal. Un pollo.
And news.
Gunfighter in town.
He's due, don't worry.
But I do, amigo. I have seen him.
Today he bought a horse
that he will use before tomorrow night.
Yeah, well...
I'm ready and waiting for him.
If you got it to spare, thank you kindly.
But this... You can't spare that.
- I can shoot mine.
- True.
To us they will not sell shot.
Shave, one dime.
I admire your enterprise.
The war shorted me on customers,
in a manner of speaking.
I had to do something
to make ends meet.
Show me that.
I'm showing that on consignment
for one of our local widows.
Husband didn't make it back.
Bargain at $50.
I'll take it.
I'll pay Mrs Guthrie when I see her.
Well, now, I didn't say Mrs...
No, sirree. I don't do business...
You can't...
What am I going to tell Mrs Guthrie?
I'll tell her.
My motto is eliminate the middleman
by hook or crook.
Señor, a usted le han pagado para que
mate a Matt Weaver.
Señor, you will kill Matt Weaver?
Señor, why does it interest you?
He is the only man here
who treats us like men.
Matt Weaver and his father before him.
The Reb?
People aren't simple, are they?
Yes, I've been hired
to kill Matt Weaver.
Save your breath
and tell them they've been wasting theirs.
If only a man with a gun can solve
their problems, I'm not the man.
I'm not even interested.
You have time to kill me and get away.
Cover up for a thief? I won't do it.
Oh, Matt.
If these bullets keep me alive,
I'll pay you back.
Say what you mean.
Say you're ready to keep on killing.
I told you, Ruth,
I'll fight to keep what's mine.
I'm ready for your gunfighter now,
so you just send him after me.
Is that the way you came in?
Well, leave that way now.
Ruth, I never thanked you for coming out
to warn me. I do thank you, Ruth.
- Hurry, Matt.
- Ruth...
I'm saying goodbye.
Only way I know.
I love you and I'm sorry I'm like I am.
Don't you cover up...
May I join you?
- Who's he?
- I board here.
No, sir. You're the gunfighter.
- A gunfighter without a gun.
- You're taking quite a chance.
I passed up my chance of killing you.
I wanted to look you over, ask a question.
Look quick. I killed so many men these
past four years, one more don't matter.
You passed up your chance.
You think I'm gonna pass up mine?
Truce for tonight.
Then you believe them
when they say I'm crazy?
So am I, but it's a funny thing.
A man crazy to live
takes a chance and dies.
A man who doesn't care takes
the same chance and gets away with it.
Let's call it Jules Gaspard's Law.
All right. All right.
So far you're getting away with it.
Now, about that question.
Why were you the one Reb
in a Union town?
What kind of a question...
Well, I used to have a reason.
Lots of them.
Was it to defend your...
let's call it your slave-owning rights.
Slave-owning rights? Slave-owning?
Whoever seen a slave in these parts?
You, Ruth?
Only my pa and me
slaving away for Brewster.
Paying off loans for seed and stock.
Took longer to pay off the interest
than the loans.
I know.
I know it's a poor, mean excuse
of a reason to carry arms.
Sometimes...
Sometimes it seems like to me
I went Reb just to cross Brewster.
Don't believe him.
He's what he is because
he can't do anything like anybody else,
and because he hates this town
as much as you do.
You both hate this town
and you've let it set you against each other.
You think you've found a way to get me
not to do what I've been paid to do.
Have I?
If I were human. I'm not, I'm told.
You don't want to be. I believe that you are.
I say you're gonna try
to earn your blood money.
Right.
You stand between me
and something I want.
Mm-hm. When the time comes,
it'll help to know you aren't human.
Ruth!
Where are you? Ruth!
You stopped me.
Couldn't have you claiming my $500.
- You let him get away.
- My aim was off.
I don't see you hotfooting after him.
I'm tired. Your wife caught him stealing.
I mistakenly came to her rescue
without my gun.
- We'll make a fresh start tomorrow.
- Sure.
Good night.
- You caught him stealing?
- Yes.
- Or arranged it?
- No.
Or maybe set up a truce parley
between him and the gunfighter?
Sober up before you accuse me.
What did you promise the gunfighter
to let Matt go?
Oh. I saw Mr Adams.
Then I saw you through the...
It's early, but I thought you might be...
- You're not open?
- We just opened.
If Mrs Adams isn't about yet,
I can just come back a little later.
What did you have in mind?
Just some thread. So it can wait.
Mrs Guthrie, do you know that I am now
the proud possessor of this?
That isn't why I came here.
Don't think that's why I came here.
Are you willing to part with it to me?
I must part with it...
if you're sure you want it.
I want it.
Now, what did Mr Fiddler
say it was worth?
He said...
He thought I might get $25 for it.
Now, 50's the price Mr Fiddler quoted
and what it's worth to me.
I can't allow you to...
Now, Mrs Guthrie,
don't you think you owe yourself...
a new dress?
I haven't had a new dress since...
Well, it's been a long time.
Silk.
Or maybe something gay.
I really can't decide.
I'm afraid of losing all control
with my new-found riches.
I'll have to think it over
and come back later.
- Thread.
- Yes.
Thread. I do need some thread.
It's white.
- Thank you for opening for me.
- There you are, Ruth.
Good morning, Hannah. One spool
of thread. That's 12 cents, please.
It's a lovely morning, isn't it? Just lovely.
I pray that the watch
will be worth $50 to you.
Mrs Guthrie, if one dollar of it
finds its way into Mr Fiddler's pocket,
I promise you I'll smash the watch.
Yes. You...
Here you are.
I think I'll buy enough material
to make a bonnet to match.
You don't keep a record
of 12-cent sales?
What are you?
You know all you need to know.
A hired killer.
How could you choose such a life?
Choose?
Why did you marry Crane Adams?
Shall I help? You both loved music.
He lost his arm
in the holy war to free the slaves,
lost music with his arm.
So you made it up to him,
hating slavery as you do.
If you do.
Because I've never seen it?
Can't you hate an idea? I hated it.
- And loved Crane for hating it too?
- Wanted to.
You're forgetting
I was born in New Orleans,
where we see things differently.
- Black men are born to be slaves.
- You can't believe that.
- Because all men are born equal?
- They should be.
Now, you wanted to know
how I turned gunfighter.
Well, my father educated me
beyond what the New Orleanians
would call my station in life.
- I don't understand.
- You don't?
My mother asked my father
to improve my position.
He refused.
She kept asking.
It annoyed him.
So he sold her.
You see, we could say
that Crane lost his arm to free me.
To free me for what?
That is the question, Mrs Adams.
Have you lost your voice?
Don't look like that.
It's not what you've just told me, it's...
- It's what it's made of you.
- No.
There was a wide choice
for the son of a quadroon slave.
Piano player in a fancy house,
back-room gladiator
for white gentlemen betters.
But your name,
that beautiful French name.
Oh, yes. My father's name.
I'm covering it with glory.
You pity him?
I pity his son.
Save your pity for Matt Weaver.
He's dying tonight.
Please.
Last night you let him live.
Today you're going to kill him
because of something I've said or done?
There's something I want from you.
It's not pity.
Leave your husband
and this hellhole of a town
with me.
Think about it.
Will you kill Matt Weaver, señor?
Señor, I am not here to talk.
I am here on very important business.
Do not kill Matt Weaver.
I've been paid to kill him,
I swore to kill him
and I want to kill him.
Then why do you drink in the morning?
Don't worry about the Reb.
His skin is white.
If the white town finds out they need him,
they'll find a way of getting to him.
No. Never.
Soon.
If I am wrong,
if he lets himself be used,
I will load your gun for you.
Stand by, señor. Stand by.
I guess you didn't hear Crane Adams.
Jewel let Matt Weaver
fly free as a bird last night.
Shot at him and missed.
Fine gunfighter.
He's a dead shot. He done it on purpose.
He's from New Orleans.
Mr Brewster, he's a Reb, just like Matt.
You all had your say now?
All right.
I want to do whatever's right
and best for us all.
Whosoever would be chief among you,
let him be your servant.
So, let's hear the will of this meeting.
- Get rid of the gunfighter.
- Now.
So be it.
I'm elected to do the talking, am I?
Then you all bear me witness
I do it right.
Today we vary your diet.
There.
God in heaven.
- Going to the hotel.
- Yeah.
Going past it now.
Fiddler's locked his door.
Like a dog in a garbage heap.
Yes. A mad dog.
What's he doing?
Stop him!
Talk, or I will.
Jewel...
I'd like to have a word with you.
Well, here I am.
I...
I'd like...
a few words in private, Jewel.
- A few words here.
- All right.
Kneel.
On your knees, Mr Brewster.
Rooster ruler of the roost.
Get on your knees.
Repeat after me.
Don't face me, face this miserable animal.
He's doing it.
Now... repeat after me.
"I am a thief and a hypocrite
"and I beg forgiveness
"for all the filth
I've burdened you with
"in this dirtiest of towns
"on the dirty face of the earth. "
Say it.
Matt!
Matt Weaver!
- Don't move, doc.
- I won't.
But Brewster's coming in to parley.
We got trouble, Matt.
Crane's dead. The sheriff's dead drunk.
- Ruth?
- All right last I saw her.
Gunfighter's gone on a rampage.
He smashed up the whole town.
Everybody's hid out.
What you want?
I'm going to give you the satisfaction
of hearing that from Brewster.
That much you got coming.
Deed to your farm
signed back to you by Mrs Medford.
She told me
how Medford got himself killed.
How long you known that?
Let's just call this paper a peace treaty.
War's over.
What you want from me
for my own farm?
Your help.
Why, don't look so sad
when you make a joke.
- No joke.
- Funniest I ever heard.
You bribing me to kill a gunfighter
you hired to kill me.
- I'm laughing fit to kill.
- You're right, Matt.
You got no use for me
and I got none for you.
But fair is fair.
I was wrong about Medford.
I was wrong to hire the gunfighter.
I just pray you're a better shot than him.
You think you can pray me
into being one of your fool hired hands?
The town's full of them.
You can do it and you're gonna do it,
so let's stop talking about it. I know.
You know what?
Ruth.
Ruth and the gunfighter alone in
the emporium ever since Crane was killed.
And she went back
of her own free will. I saw.
Today Crane stopped fretting about you.
Tried to kill the gunfighter.
I got a notion how come he tried.
- Go on.
- Oh, Matt.
Now, we all know Ruth's still got
a soft spot in her heart for you.
I got this notion she promised
the gunfighter something... Let you go.
Crane couldn't stand that.
He said I stood between him
and something he wanted.
Well, anyway, they been alone there
together in the emporium this past hour.
We brung a horse for you.
You've changed your mind.
It was changed for me.
Crane's dead. I'm half-dead.
If my going with you
will save one whole life...
Is that the whole reason?
I wish it were.
But the truth is
part of me wants to come with you.
And you know that.
I warn you.
It won't keep me alive very long.
You said you never lie,
so I've believed
everything you told me.
You said you'd kill Matt.
You said you aren't human.
I told you I'd been told that all my life.
It didn't have to be true.
But now you've believed it.
And now it's true.
I give you two lives for the one I took.
Yours...
and Matt Weaver's.
Because what I feel for you
might turn out to be the opposite of hate.
I can't risk that.
I'm going in.
There.
Hombres con pistolas... y Matt Weaver.
Gracias.
- Looking for me?
- No.
- You going somewheres?
- Yes.
Without earning your blood money?
Which reminds me.
The blood money.
You might use it in my name,
say for the emancipation
of the local slaves...
Reb.
I'm standing between you
and something you want?
You're standing between me
and the road out of town.
Well, if it wasn't the money,
what do you want? What did you get?
Neither profit nor pleasure.
You can't make me draw on you.
Stop trying, boy.
Matt!
Let him go.
Why is he going?
What did you give him to let me off?
Nothing.
Not true.
Cuidado!
Oh, God.
Brewster.
Throw the gun.
Get on your knees.
This time say it.
Don't face me.
Face this mule of a Reb.
Say after me...
"I am a thief
"and a liar. "
I am a thief
and a liar.
Say, "Forgive me
for betraying you and this town,
"this town that I now...
"bequeath to your care. "
Say it.
Say it.
We did it.
No, you did it, Brewster.
You turned me into one of them.
Now finish it.
Say, "Forgive me
for betraying this town. "
It's a Reb talking. I warned you.
I warned you. That's a Reb taking over!
- Say it!
- Stop him!
- Stop him!
- Say it!
We just took a vote, Sam. You heard it.
He'll walk this town like he owns it!
Ruth, I...
Hear as how you just won the war, Reb.
