Saw the face of Falconer
when Colonel shot him?
It was quiet,
and stopped.
Equal to all.
No one expects them to kill a man
to please an Indian.
I was a captain.
The logic was judging him before.
Had his trial
the trial of Colonel.
What happens to an army
when Colonel is crazy?
I had to impress
Buffalo Hump.
I wanted to demonstrate
who has courage.
If an Indian who has come
,
no mercy.
This Indian does not have mercy,
courage with or without it.
I think the Colonel is crazy.
Killing someone is not being crazy.
Believe in whatever you want,
I believe you're crazy.

- What?
Will you marry?
I?
It depends on the girl.
What if the girl
were me?
I thought you wanted
go to California, Mattie.
What would you?
I'm a weirdo.
I have dry source.
Yes, I want to go
to California.
This is what most want.
But there we could go together?
They say the grapes are very sweet it.
There are many young people here.
Why do you want an old dog?
You're the one I want.
With you I was going blind.
It's a good girl.
Yes, me
marry you.
Maybe we'll find a preacher.
Come on, guys.
There is still much.
Watch your cart.
How much farther
to return to their land.
With another dish of beans,
'll get quick to Austin.
I told you
never arrive.
You who insisted on coming.
Return home.
The open spaces do not attract newcomers.
Here are the bankers
players and professionals.
E prostitutes.
All but the Big Texan.
- Mattie left.
- Removed?
Whores retire?
Mattie yes.
Is Shad's wife.
- Do not try to imply.
- So what if I do this?
Shad will kill you.
I do not mind carrying someone.
Shadrach is an old man.
Surraria he wanted.
- Maybe.
- You are not my friend?
I did not say other than,
said "maybe".
Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Wallace.
Have something to bite?
Bites?
I was doing my needs
when a scorpion attacked me.
They threw him a curse.
First stumbles with the suitcase
and now a scorpion bites you.
Lord on this earth
everything is sharp.
Let's see Sam.
Has a lotion that heals everything.
What are delicious.
If you do not find a buffalo,
bring us a good fat pig.
Wonder where are the buffalo?
It makes no
week there were thousands.
With the rains will have to wait
a week to cross the Brazos.
You waited,
but not buffalo.
There were several thousand.
Could have been one or two.
We killed the last head of cattle.
We'll have to eat porridge to Santa Fe
You see better.
Who goes there?
- Three horses.
- No
A Buffalo and two horses..
Behind them!
- Bill.
- What?
- Bill.
- What?
Indians!
Indians!
Indians!
Comanches!
Must be a record.
Two Indians chase a buffalo
for a camp and not fire.
They were so tired and hungry
who have not seen us.
I saw, but we are united
,
a stake of torture.
Shad's right.
At least we have a buffalo
and we can forget the porridge.
- Let carnear it.
- Yes let's go.
Fortunately you have a good aim.
I have had enough,
I go home.
If the Austin,
'll go with you.
Keep it up!
Keep it up, come on!
Take care, idiots!
Stop the cart!
It will be a headache
load it on the horses.
Shit! I knew it was better to use
oxen instead of mules.
The oxen are slow.
Colonel. Look.
Who can be in the wilderness?
What do you say?
Night is not and can not be good.
- Is Charlie Goodnight.
- Who is? Do not know.
Very soon you know.
Hello, I'm
Charlie Goodnight.
This is Bill and this is Bose.
What do these carts with
?
This was not made for them.
Why not take some coffee?
We're not used to visitors.
I'm sorry,
these girls were abducted
and their parents will be quiet no
until they see them.
Did not answer me on the wagons.
Lord, do not know
Who are we?
. I did not recognize
General Lloyd.
It's too drunk to travel.
Us shipment
Texas to Santa Fe.
Let's go to New Mexico.
We want to win it.
We'll have to hang some
Mexicans,
but win.
They hang you.
If it will arrive.
Why did not we were going to get?
This is the Great Rock.
Then nothing.
Nothing.
There will be grass anyway.
Sure there is something.
That yes, a lot of grass.
But it's been 15 years that I am ranger
and did not know anyone
you can live grass.
Not seen a horse
scroll 600 km without water.
I was told that there is a step
behind the Red River.
Yes, it is true, but not behind the Red
.
Not behind the Red
?
Not behind
Large Wichita.
The Great Wichita.
I told you
was not in the red.
Just shifting sands
.
I never trusted that Pawnee.
We lost and will attempt
us take the horses.
Hello, Shad.
Complied with the 100?
I lack little, Charlie.
- Miss. Roberts.
- All right, Charlie?
Wallace, for who wants to go to
New Mexico wants to be hanged?
There are forces in Texas?
Not let it hang me.
They will wish the gallows
Buffalo Hump catch you.
's Comanche territory.
This is for them
not for you.
I came to rescue these
children and return home.
I would advise you to do the same.
Please
provisions for them.
I will do you evil, can eat.
Thank you.
Care.
Do not let Wolf
Kicker steal their horses.
They will have to eat them to get
to New Mexico.
I hear the parrot.
Charlie Goodnight's funny.
I've seen.
Dec.
Dec.
Bad news.
How can you be good?
What happened now?
Bs and gives Alchise
gone.
Took ten horses.
Fucking bastards!
You can get them?
I want to hang the two on a mast.
Go after them!
Take the two cables!
This is bad.
Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Come.
This is the Palo Duro Canyon
.
It seems that not
never ends.
There is no food for
reach Santa Fe.
'll Let escape these thieves.
The Comanches are in charge of them.
Call, go tell that to Colonel
.
Gus and I will look for a descent.
Soon. We'll have to catch these
buffalo.
Come on!
God!
Come on!
Colonel! Colonel!
- I saw some Indians!
- Were Comanches.
We came to a canyon filled
buffalo,
hundreds of them.
Gus and Wallace are
looking for a shortcut.
Good news. Sam!
See if you can get this arm
and then we will kill some buffalo.
I do not know how many
Comanches may be.
Does not matter.
We rescue them.
's A good day to fight.
- Let behind the Buffaloes!
- Yup!
We saw 20 Indians,
but there could be thousands.
We can kill 20,
but thousands do not know.
Not want to lose such meat.
The canyon is very steep,
not want to climb it with
Buffalo Hump following me.
- What do we do?
- Camping and watch.
Perhaps the Comanches are gone and
can kill some buffalo.
Let's go.
- Tell the Colonel.
- No, tell him.
Let's go.
Colonel.
Colonel.
- We lose...
- Twenty horses.
It's as if the earth had swallowed them
.
Not swallowed them,
Wolf Kicker stole.
Would steal a horse up in a store.
He shall put on the tail of a
Horse until
mate to kick.
With a name like Wolf Kicker
would very well.
- Colonel, look.
- What?
Fire!
You'd better go back to the last stream!
Collect all!
Come on, guys!
Gather everything and go!
Quiet, boy!
Quiet, horse!
Right!
Go fast!
- They closed the circle!
- In the push into the canyon!
- We're surrounded!
- We have to jump!
- There is no room?
- No, we're stuck.
The canyon is not so steep!
Let's go down
and resist!
The ravine, guys!
Come on, Beelzebub.
Caution!
I've got you!
- Carefully.
- Yes
God..
Sam this tired.
We lost the dentist.
Try not have toothache.
Look.
Is Buffalo Hump.
- Damn, gunpowder!
- Yes, the shooting is over.
Buffalo Hump.
Where are the Indians?
If provoked another fire,
end up baked like rabbits.
Are not you worried?
Thought much on the bad.
I thought I wanted to be a ranger,
but met this girl.
Now I am sure that only thinks
in the business of fabrics.
I was thinking about girls,
except in
die burned.
Being a ranger
means it can die.
If you do not want to use it
can leave it.
Shit!
What did you do?
I could have hit him with the butt.
This deer was young.
I doubt run over 3 km.
If we pursue it,
can kill it.
Absolutely.
Matilda, do not be long.
Shadrach!
Wallace!
Where the hell are you?
Mattie.
Course they camped and slept.
It is hard to steer this
day of plain
how they will do night
?
Only been out one night.
Perhaps they fled.
May not come back.
Where?
We are in the midst of the plain.
No
to go.
This is dead.
If they come back, I think of killing them.
Why do this two batters
to follow a deer?
Is unknown.
A what?
An unknown,
something that is not understood.
As two batters
are following a deer.
Better to be two to one.
I would not go without someone who could
find the way back.
Shad never lost,
of night or day.
If not returned
it is because he died.
Sure that bastard killed him.
And if it was, why not
wanted to take me with him.
Love is cruel sometimes.
Okay, Mattie?
Not!
Not!
Mattie said he would marry
so find a preacher.
We're married.
The preacher would be the icing.
It is risky to remove a whore.
Especially when traveling
so many tough guys.
Mattie if retreated alone.
And who meddle with it
have to do with me.
I'm too old to go cold.
Also,
I always liked Mattie.
Know her a long time.
Yes.
I met her on the first day
I got to Missouri.
A few ten years.
I led a group
St. Louis to Santa Fe.
People of the fur company.
His father was a drunk.
One night got drunk,
she fell into the river and drowned.
Her mother came into
fever a few days later
and Mattie was orphaned.
There were 50 men and no
were no angels.
The head of the caravan said
her to prostitute
or left.
Were times difficult.
Yes
So there was no place
for ladies in the West.
There was only for whores.
- And they did not hold long.
- Mattie yes.
Mattie has courage.
Remember the turtle
that took?
The scare that gave everyone.
It is very strong.
Fished you, Shad.
And it's over.
Yes, fished me,
Bigfoot.
I'll be with the Mattie
until I live.
- Shad!
- This is my girl.
I thought had died.
Hart was faster
expected,
linger to catch.
- Where the hell were they?
- Where do you think?
No one told you
Ago I was a deer!
If I had a
handcuffs, arrest them.
To me you do not
arrest ever.
I'll put a bullet in you.
I am Colonel, can not
ignore my orders!
Not Colonel, is no longer
a pirate land.
The expelled sea and now
tries to hack Santa Fe.
I do not take orders from you, Cobb.
Shadrach also think so.
We'll see if I can not chain it
when you split you.
Quiet!
Are you crazy?
We need every man to survive.
It is better to book
to the Comanches.
Drop that knife, Bigfoot.
- Release!
- It's ok.
Okay.
But I keep on
command, understand?
I do not know how I rejoice.
Meta your orders
where you see fit.
- Why fight?
- For hungry, I suppose.
I have so much, that even I
would give a stab someone.
We can eat the deer.
Once we cook.
There'll hold one more day without food.
I take these two wires
to see if we hunt something.
Whatever you give you will.
But remember one thing:
If they catch you,
not say how many we are.
What believe that we are thousand.
I do not think
assume the all-powerful army.
What we would capture
the only way to follow alive.
Let me catch up what
Had caught me food.
Come on, guys.
For my mother, a buffalo.
Caution,
slowly.
Not scared.
I shoot first.
If you do not fall,
shoot you.
Behind the front paw.
Shit!
Why does not fall?
I got it completely twice.
Me too!
How to know you hit?
Is half blind.
Let's go.
Poor ignorant!
The mountains are there.
Where there are mountains there is snow
and where there is snow, water.
They want to go where there is nothing.
Die!
For there is the Canadian and
sure there is water at this time.
The Canadian is
walking one week.
What do you think drinking
for a week?
Scream all you want.
Come and let us now.
They are crazy!
If you do not die of hunger
,
the Comanches will kill them.
It's crazy, Turner!
They are all crazy!
There are partridges?
Well, son.
Gus. Gus.
Why do not you stop?
We have three.
Come on, Gus.
Stop fire!
You have three.
And what others have?
Where did you learn to throw stones as well?
If you practice a lot,
can hit on everything that point.
If you shoot so well,
why not shot the buffalo?
I've never seen anything like it.
It was a buffalo
spellbound.
Why do you think
ran?
I think that we are demons.
Caleb Cobb could win
this state, if
got here.
Here I see soldiers.
Can drink.
Texas is far away.
I'm the captain Salazar.
Unhook the weapons and we will not do them harm.
What welcome.
This is not good welcome.
It is an arrest.
We let the arrest.
Best arrested than dead.
They're brats.
One that would have won
if not caíssemos this ambush.
Captain
is not a brat
and had a good gun.
The walls are mud.
We could dig a hole.
And where were going, Woodrow?
Not seeing this?
Almost died of hunger on the way.
So far, we ridicule
in every battle.
Well, we're alive.
We can learn.
This should be part of Mexico
that is not full of gold and silver.
I told you not to expect
find gold and silver.
Try to sleep.
We leave early.
I can not sleep thinking of the boys.
Gus and Call are young.
I'm afraid not return to see them.
No, certainly will
headquarters
but and who does not?
Stop worrying.
They were with Bigfoot Wallace,
the best batsman I know.
Will bring them soon and safe.
Bigfoot.
It's good,
but is not the best.
The best are here,
with me.
Roncaria equal even though they were
about to hang him.
Well, if
hang him,
is better than snore.
Good morning, gentlemen.
We have a ways to go.
That delay, make a
hour dawned.
I had a trial.
Then bring the convict.
It gives Bs.
What made this thief?
Stole a ring from
governor's wife.
So come so far,
to steal the gold and silver.
I think the Colonel had
right about silver.
But I said nothing of the shootings.
At least we will see Santa Fe.
They say it's very beautiful.
Never Summer Santa Fe
Let's south,
where your friends,
and we will take them to St. Lazarus.
Where is Saint Lazarus?
Step Along the North.
- How many?
- The 800
- What cold.
- Yes.
Has lived very well.
There is cold.
Within two months it will do so cool,
this summer look.
Looks like a buffalo.
It's a bear!
There is a bear
any, is a grizzly bear.
Do not look and run!
I can not run with chains!
- For jump!
- Run!
It's amazing how the horse
hit the bear.
Nothing could topple.
We did a favor.
We have done walking
until leave lame.
Hopefully it has been pleased
with the horse and not follow us.
Why would you go?
Maybe eaten Texans
before and like our taste.
Then I would eat the Woodrow.
He's from Texas and I
Tennessee.
It will be better to wait it stops raining.
I do not know where we are.
I see someone
someone moves.
I hope not to be the bear.
If it was the bear,
would have devoured us.
Are people from Salazar.
What we do?
Kill or leave them?
If you are unarmed,
can not kill them in cold blood
.
One of them gave us coffee.
I think not seek
fight.
Just want to escape the bear
like us.
You can go home!
Come on!
We will not have time
to chats!
Long!
Not understand.
Come on!
Come on!
I hope not follow us.
If the bear wants us
hunt in the hunt.
Can follow you with the smell.
It could be three meters from us.
They are very silent
if they are not angry as before.
I hope you do not come.
A friend was eaten by a
bear in the river Trinity.
We heard the tracks.
Eaten?
As?
The ate and left.
Why do not you
account that?
Willy was fishing
And the bear came by
back in silence.
I had no idea
of the bear
walked around.
They are so silent,
who do not realize.
The eaten all at once.
- Including the buckle.
- The buckle?
Yes
had a buckle in eagle form.
I always liked
Willy was dead and had no family,
but that bear ate
no avail Willy hide.
That was all.
I see a light.
Is a fire.
Yes, but who?
Could be Indians or Mexicans.
We will wait to dawn.
And if you see that bear?
I would rather die of a gunshot
that destroyed by a bear.
Gus, do not forward
or lose.
You make them,
I'm out.
Shut up, they can hear you.
- He was whispering.
- For awaken the dead.
Who's there?
Billy? It's us.
- Are you?
- Yes, let's approach.
No, wait
a moment.
I have to think about it.
Bill, we are.
What's to think?
Bigfoot said that the Comanches
can mimic voices.
Could be Comanches.
I'm not Comanche,
am Gus McCrae.
Yes, I do
that is yes.
Forgive me my nerves.
I'm a little nervous.
In front.
There's nothing to eat?
No
. We ha
two days without eating.
Shad is very weak.
And his parrot, Colonel?
Beelzebub?
Ate it.
We made a soup.
Gathered nationwide.
How many are left?
Thirty with you.
But that's not the worst.
That left few bullets.
I'll have to kill ten
with every shot.
The truth is that this adventure
does not seem the same since we made soup
with Beelzebub.
Is equal to the first time
I left, nobody
know what to do.
Now we are worse than with Major Chevallie.
Guess I'll have
a little chat with this
general.
I need the flag.
Why do you need a flag?
Since you brought this fret,
why not use it?
- Maybe impress.
- I have it.
Call Cable, tie his rifle.
You and McCrae cable
accompany me.
If this general
have a little
education, we will take
breakfast.
Let's go.
Gus, keep me
a piece of bacon.
Die for a piece.
Have good luck.
Shad, could kill them.
- They're stupid.
- Come on, Mattie, quiet.
Are with the flag of the republic
,
will not kill them.
Care.
They will not kill us.
We're three, would be cowards
if they had just us.
- Do not rely too.
- Ignore the infantry.
Do not look for them.
Let's get right to the head.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Escaped bear.
Normally I
the fusillade,
but you can not blame anyone
for running away from a bear.
I see you already know
.
We traveled together.
I am Colonel Cobb,
want to see the general.
I'll introduce you.
Can download the flag?
We know who we are.
Willing to take the breakfast?
We have eggs.
Thank you ever ate.
- I can offer them a coffee?
- Yes please.
What's this?
Do not eat anything since
those partridges.
These people have everything.
We have nothing.
Do not eat with the enemy while
our eat the belt.
It's not our fault that
not have come here.
Drink this
coffee and think about what you lost.
Ate?
They were offered, but refused
.
I do not think in curling
my friends are hungry.
I see.
A very noble attitude.
I prefer to be selfish. I took
a big morning coffee with fried eggs.
I would like to go.
I can not.
I surrendered to General Dimasio.
I promised that
if depusermos the weapons, not die.
I do not think lay down their arms until
kill me.
Do not be insolent, Corporal.
When I give an order,
must obey.
You're too young, not let
to die for nonsense.
I would rather die fighting
to be bound by chains.
If you decided to die,
I am willing to please him.
I killed for disobeying me Falconer
and I will do the same to you.
Drop the gun, Woodrow.
Colonel, you are a coward
.
Could watch this man
until you calm down?
It is very restless.
Cable McCrae, go
where this troop
and lay down their arms.
And tell them to eat that will give
once they have surrendered.
I will, but can be
they do not like.
I do not think repeat the Alamo.
Colonel Travis was crazy
, a brave crazy,
but at least I had a church.
We have nothing!
This war is over.
Go now.
Sooner go,
take before breakfast.
Where are you going now?
I go to Santa Fe
With this army..
General said that the governor
wants to meet me.
Me
He plans to throw a party.
- Put the gun down, sir!
- No!
It is my prisoner, not yours.
Let me go!
- What are the orders?
- Depor weapons.
Caleb This is a pig,
to have surrendered.
What do you think, Shad?
We can flee to the hills
and take refuge in.
Survive a few,
should load but a few.
Would not survive anyone.
Maybe respected Mattie.
I do not want to live without Shad.
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too.
I surrender to me
give breakfast.
Sure we put in row
and kill us, but I want to take
breakfast.
I hope you cook well.
Well, guys, are many.
We surrender.
Is brave but foolish.
Your colonel had no
choice but to surrender.
His men have
ammunition or food.
If you do not surrender,
would have died.
I hate Caleb Cobb.
At least now there will be
so beautiful at the banquet.
Not you too not after
receiving 100 lashes.
If you want to talk with your friend,
the McCrae cable,
on.
I'll talk to him later.
You may not
there is a later.
I hope to live.
If you end up with the Call,
I swear this
goat will not live.
- My God, you are alive.
- It is amazing.
Few men would have survived.
You'll live to bury you.
It is very strong.
If endure three days,
survive and will walk to St. Lazarus.
Not listen.
He said he will live to bury you.
- Died?
-. I'm alive.
But still in danger.
Woodrow shall never die.
- Tomorrow the cable walk.
- It is impossible.
I brought him the wagon
to warm up.
Shadrach neither should walk.
You'll have to burn the cart
or someone freeze.
All men must go.
The cable walk.
Apache Indians.
Yes, you're right.
We are in Apache territory.
This is the work of
chief apache Gómez.
He only would a general way.
Most
Apache Indians
sell,
but they did not.
It's not your law.
It is normal to violate.
I do not see Colonel
by any party.
Of course the coward
escaped.
Boys!
Colonel?
Boys?
Are you?
These Apaches demons
blinded me with thorns.
They broke my leg
and abandoned me.
In surprised at dawn.
Now we are in La Jornada del Muerto.
Is terrible even for a sane man.
Many die crossing,
can be everyone.
We can not take it,
should take care of us.
I'm lame.
I will not stay.
Give me a horse and
soldier and I'll get to Santa Fe
We can not take you
and not let
back.
If I give you a horse,
Gómez will find it and it will be worse.
- I'll take that risk.
- But I do not.
You are a brave,
put the end of his career.
I am a sailor.
I never thought to die in the desert.
Should be in my ship.
What the hell am I doing here?
I know it's a big
pirate, Colonel Cobb.
Stole many treasures of Spain.
Yes.
And I lost the game.
Give me the gun and
continue their way.
Texans are angry with me for having surrendered.
Me enforcariam if they could.
Would be happy nagging them killing me.
Wallace, the best
place is in the eye?
Yes.
It's not my lucky day.
There remained eyes.
I think it will be worth it.
Behind them!
Get the guns!
- Colonel, shoot them!
- I'll kill them!
Is shooting at us, Colonel!
Do not move.
Does not seem very serious.
This is the end.
Not true,
just need rest.
I'll take care of you.
It's a great woman, remember.
I just feel there on
married and before he died.
It does not matter.
We were well married, Shad.
Do not worry.
Not!
Shad.
Shad! my God.
What happened to you?
Mattie.
- Shad died. .
- No
It's the truth.
No
I can not support
,
was the only one he had.
Mattie, sad,
but may be the best.
I was too weak to cross the desert.
I would not have survived.
Would have died,
as almost everyone.
We are lucky.
You do.
If the bullet hit him two
Centimeters to the right,
would like Shad.
Life is very curious, Captain.
The Shad had shot in
best shooters from the west.
And then this,
killed by a blind.
They were to meet for a long time.
My Shad?
Since I was 14.
My parents and I
put ourselves heading north,
en route to Santa Fe
Shad was one of the guides.
It was the most beautiful
man he had ever seen.
