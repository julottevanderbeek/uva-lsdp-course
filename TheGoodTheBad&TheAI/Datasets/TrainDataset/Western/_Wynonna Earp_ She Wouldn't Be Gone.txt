Wynonna Earp.
Seems there's a mole in my
organization, Jim.
And you are gonna help me find it.
Gus is getting
an offer to buy the bar.
- Decisions had to be made.
- What's this?
It's freedom! Now you can do
whatever it is you want.
Runaway, or who knows what kind
of trouble this girl got herself into.
- There are lacerations.
- Bite-marks.
From scavengers.
I got a message
for Wynonna Earp.
- Bobo bought Shorty's.
-
Where is he? Where's Bobo? Ow!
Hey! "Ow" is code for
"hands off," douche.
- The Heir!
-
Lower your guns
or I paint these walls
revenant brown faster
than a bad case of food poisoning.
Bloodbaths
are bad for business.
Jock, show these fine women
some hospitality. Girls.
- What'll you have?
- A tall glass
of "you're officially next
on my hell-bound and down list."
- You want some ice with that?
- You stole Gus's bar.
No, I paid what
she asked for it.
This is our stuff.
Papers are signed.
It's nice to see that we haven't
lost our favourite bar wench.
Yeah, I quit.
I'm gonna need
that T-shirt back.
Want me to help you peel it off?
-
- Let's go.
Wait.
Now, you come into my business,
draw your weapons and insult me.
I'm gonna need a token of apology.
- That was Willa's.
- It's mine now.
I can't wait for you
to shoot him in the face.
Zoning out to Drake?
This "hotline bling"
only features revheads
enjoying watered-down beer.
Please, don't try to be cool.
It's literally the worst.
- You were supposed to wait.
- Are you saying we're in?
: Those Earp
girls may be bangable,
Hey! We're in.
: I'm out. I'm out.
I got out.
: I got out.
Well. Some days, the meat
walks right into your lap.
Do you have a phone?
- I need a phone.
- Come on inside, darlin',
sure. You can ring my ding-a-ling.
What's that you got there?
Jesus.
Next gas station's a mile back that way.
Get moving. I mean it, girlie. Git!
Can you just...
tell my Mom that I'm sorry I ran off?
I was so angry
and I was so wrong.
When she comes to collect me,
can you just tell her
- that I love her?
-
-
- Please.
-
- Won't be nothing left
- of you to fetch.

'Cause I gave you
all I've got to give
And no, that ain't no way to live
I told that devil
To take you back
I told that devil to take you back
They're talking
about Dolls, guys!
They're speculating
that your penis is small!
Going in just the two
of you? Pretty risky.
There was an opening.
And we would've loved some
backup, but you went AWOL.
How long have you known
that Bobo is telekinetic?
So he can move objects
with the power of his mind.
- I got a big shiny gun.
- Yeah, and if he can yank
- a necklace, why not Peacemaker?
- I don't know.
How about we get him alone
and shoot him with Peacemaker,
and then it won't matter?
Send this prick back
to hell, not have him hosting happy hour
at my favourite bar.
Hey. Literally all
they're talking about
is how many pints they can chug.
Men are all the same,
even the demonic ones.
Surveillance:
mucho taxing on my bladder.
Alright, look.
I'm sorry that I missed
your infiltration of Shorty's, OK?
Nice try. I already clocked
the bruises on your knuckles.
Sorry I didn't tell you about
stupid Bobo's stupid powers.
But we are so close.
OK.
Bobo wanted Constance
Clootie to give him
some way out of the
Ghost River Triangle.
- Some... lead.
- A lead? Like a clue?
Right? Who knows. Anyway,
she didn't give it to him;
or lied about ever having it and now
he's up shit creek.
So what's his new escape plan?
Yeah, why buy Shorty's?
To infiltrate the town?
- To piss us off?
- That can be a bonus feature.
But the bar does
have doors that can lock
and is often filled with human
civilians. Human civilians who...
Who would freak if
their designer overalls
were splattered with
gooey brown demon brain.
Perfect cover. As long as he's
in there, we can't go in hot,
or... boom! Mutually
assured destruction.
- Listen.
- :
Trailer park, we was protected.
You don't think
I'll protect you?
No, Bobo, it's just...
the heir.
- Ohh.
-
She got Whiskey Jim, too.
- What's a Whiskey Jim?
- Shh, please. I'm just trying
to listen, OK? Thanks.
He's back! Bobo!
He's back!
Cal, calm your tits.
Have a drink.
LOU!
Impossible.
There's no way he would
cross back into my territory.
- We had a deal...
- No, I seen this twinkie.
She bore his mark.
And then she...
And then he... LOU!
Goddammit!
Do me a goddamn favour.
All of you!
Refrain from mentioning that name,
because the next piece
of excrement who utters it
will get the Levi treatment.
Hell's Gate, burning insanity,
the whole nine yards.
-
- What the hell, Cal?
It's this goddamn tin tooth.
It picks up radio frequencies sometimes.
What kind of frequencies?
Eeny...
meeny...
miny...
...hoes.
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, we're burnt.
Hi.
Doc Holliday has been boarding
his 130 year old mustang
in Wynonna Earp's ample paddock.
Giddy up!
What... Who is this
Lou guy? Did you hear that?
I have never heard Bobo so unsettled.
Have you? I haven't.
Maybe we can use him,
you know? Track him down?
My enemy's enemy. Perfect.
- Yeah.
- Lou. Lou bird.
Louie Luau. That's what
we should concentrate on.
That is the take-away here. Big time.
Yeah. Bae, don't hurt
yourself. Right, Earp?
I'm gonna find some more
information on this Lou guy.
- You think he's a revenant?
- If he is,
maybe we can make an agreement.
Extra time up here
for some more information
on Bobo Del Rey, alright?
Where are you
going now? Again?
- I'm going to go do my thing.
- Your thing?
Earp, please, just don't
get distracted by Doc's horse.
There it is. Hey!
Don't forget your phone.
- Thanks.
- Yep.
Shit.
Why are you guys in Nedley's office?
- 'Cause when...
- Yes.
OK, here she blows.
Uh...
Doc and I slept together.
And that's news? Really?
- To you, OK.
-
Really? We're both grownups.
One of you is a little bit
more grown up, don't you think?
- Little bit.
- Why are you
- telling me this now?
- It's out there. Thanks, Bobo.
- Bobo knows?
- Yes. And Dolls.
Uh-oh. Well, do you love Doc?
It was just sex, Waverly.
- God!
- That's not a no!
Jim. Seems Black Badge
has got themselves a rat.
Bobo, I swear.
I swear I didn't tell them nothing.
I know, Jim.
But you're going to start.
Hey, Mister, want a ride?
Always. Wynonna Earp,
the only woman so bold as to woo a man
- with another woman's car.
- I thought if anyone
should have it, it's you.
And exactly what
am I to do with it?
What do you usually do
with your enemy's horse?
Shoot it, ride it, paint it
something other than pink?
Colour is the only thing
this pony has going for it.
Strong, masculine.
Pink's traditionally
a girl's colour.
Oh, how history
rewrites itself.
Back in my day, girls were all
delicate and dainty in blues.
I think you would be...
very pretty in blue.
Everybody knows.
About us.
The sex.
I remember.
The sex.
Between us.
Not that there's
really an "us."
Dolls is on the move.
- Stalking multiple men, are we?
- Where the hell is he going?
Oh, hey!
-
-
- You tracked me?
- Of course not.
I tracked your phone.
All the way to Serial Killers
Paradise, apparently.
- What are you doing here, Dolls?
- My job. Some of which
- you do not get to be privy to.
- So I sleep with Doc
and suddenly I'm on
a need-to-know basis, huh?
- Come on.
- Hey! Listen.
If you're keeping things
from me... important things...
A lot of men have hurt me
lately. Don't be one of them.
Listen to me: no one in there
is going to hurt you. OK?
Promise?
Yeah. Promise.
Good.
Still, like to check it out for myself.
Earp, you're interfering
with government business. Earp!
Earp. Hey! Do not go in there.
Come here. Earp! Earp, hey.
EARP!
Holy elaborate torture shit.
- The Heir.
- Revenant scum.
Should have known.
How long you been here?
Well, it's kinda hard to tell.
Two weeks, maybe.
Time moves different when you're being
held against your will, doesn't it?
What does Dolls want with you?
Just keeps jabbing me
with his needles.
Thought he'd drain me dry.
Worst part is...
he never asks me nothing.
He's not much of a talker.
-
- Me?
I'm a little more chatty. You're
one of Bobo's key guys, right?
Tell me something:
- who's Lou?
-
Well? Answer the woman.
- Answer her.
- Yeah, Lou.
So, Bobo's ex-boy-toy? Frenemy?
- What?
- More like archenemy.
Nobody tries to overthrow
Bobo and lives to tell.
Unless Lou's a serious badass
and Bobo is scared of him.
Bingo. Long time ago...
like, 100 years ago...
Lou and Bobo were thick as thieves.
Now the only thing is,
Lou had a very sadistic streak.
Whereas Bobo subsidized
the town daycare. Go on.
Well, Lou never understood
why revenants needed to hide,
disguise their true nature,
when we could rule.
Make you meat puppets our slaves.
Revenant proud. Got it.
- So Bobo cast him out?
- More like,
Bobo ran away. When Lou left,
he took something so dangerous,
no one would ever
try to cross him again.
- A weapon?
- Something like that.
OK.
Where do we find him?
No one's seen Lou for years.
Heir after heir, he never showed up.
-
-
Dammit! He's in the Pine Barrens!
See, Jimbo.
That wasn't so bad. Hmm?
No, no, ah, ah!
Pine Barrens. Beautiful
place, hella bad rep.
Big chemical spill a few years ago
and then rumours that
the trees are haunted,
as many years back as I can remember.
Jimmy-boy gave up Lou's locale
way too quickly. He's lying.
He's terrified. An involuntary
vacay at Club Torment
- will do that to you.
- My BBD superiors need
- a constant stream of samples.
- You kidnapped Whiskey Jim
- to keep feeding the beast?
- And to see how Bobo
and company got a hold of some pretty,
pretty high-level Black Badge intel.
You think we have a mole?
- Do you think it's me?
- Would I have just told you if I did?
: OK...
God.
This whole time you were
disappearing, I thought...
Thought what?
I thought you were sick. OK?
I thought you were bad sick,
like don't tell your friends
'cause it's gonna scare them
sick. I thought you were sick!
- 'Cause sometimes you get sick.
- OK. Alright!
But you're not, so
I can be pissed at you.
Have at 'er then, geez.
I'm not sick, exactly.
Lou's here, Dolls. Right here.
Torture doesn't result in
actionable intelligence, OK?
Those things
are cockroaches to me...
Don't do that. Do not
do that. I saw your eyes
back there. They were cold and callous.
Don't get all hard and
forget that you're human.
That you are you.
- I won't.
- Just remember,
revenants will say anything with a ticket
to Hell pressed to their forehead.
Those the warmest
shoes you got?
Hear that?
What?
A whole lot of nothing that'll
kill you if you lose focus.
Funny.
I actually have training
in hostile environment
- survival tactics.
- You also grew up in Arizona.
- How'd you know that?
- Most excited I ever saw you
get was when the Cardinals
beat the Cowboys.
That was an amazing goal.
Look, we stay in each
other's sights at all times.
Stay hydrated, but
don't get anything wet.
Watch the UV rays. Killer
when they bounce off snow.
Sylvan dread.
- Who what now?
- Also known as hylophobia.
It's an intense fear of the woods.
Awesome. Let's do this!
Where'd you get that?
A vexing present from Wynonna.
You two knocked boots,
now she's giving you gifts?
Please!
A gentleman always removes his boots.
- Ew!
- Your childish attitude
- on the matter is noted.
- It's your attitude
that I'm worried about.
This whole "relationship" is
a train wreck waiting to happen.
I mean, what will the team
do when you two implode?
Wynonna and I are not in
a relationship. Sex alone
- a relationship does not make.
- Again, ew.
I do not kiss and tell,
especially with a lady friend's
little sister. What's important is:
why did she give me a car?
OK, so you're just gonna
smash this thing to bits
- 'cause it feels good?
- Well, unless you've got
- a better suggestion.
- You could learn to drive.
Just an idea.
Indeed.
OK. I think Whiskey Jim
might've been pulling my boob.
- Silver dreads?
- Let's just say:
I lost people, once, amongst the trees.
What people?
What a racket!
What are they singing?
Funeral dirge.
Earp!
- Earp!
-
Earp!
- Earp!
- Dolls?
Sun's gonna start heading down.
We should head back.
- It's too soon!
- Dolls?
Wynonna?
Dolls, are you getting this?
-
- Earp,
- if you're messing with me, I...
- Xavier!
: Xavier! Xavier!
- Wynonna, where are you?
- I'm here, silly.
Look at it.
-
- I am!
It's beautiful,
Dolls. Come on!
Oh, shit. I'm dead, aren't I?
You have been reborn,
and soon you will meet Yiska.
Cool.
- Anybody got an Advil?
- Who are you?
Courtney. You must be Yiska.
My name is Eve. This is Margo.
I'm the one you seek.
Have you come to us seeking liberation
from the mind control of their
radio waves and phone towers?
Have I! Uh-huh.
You guys were not easy
to find without Google Maps.
So this isn't yours?
An evil I'll be
glad to do without.
Yeah. Totally didn't need that.
I sense darkness
in you. Deceit.
And usually a pint or two.
You yourself say
the light never lies.
- It chose her.
- Yeah, the light! That was...
warm.
You are safe here,
amongst your sisters.
'K. What are you?
Those that need to be led
seek me out and I give them guidance.
I don't follow very well.
I'd say I'm more of a fighter.
We have room
for those as well.
Your bath is ready.
My... my bath?
: What the fudge?
Oh, yeah.
Awesome. Do I just...
Nope?
OK.
Woo!
Spa vibe.
Here I go!
It's hot!
So... relaxing.
Did you burn the rest of my stuff?
Even the stuff that wasn't,
you know, flammable?
Like a thing that
goes around your waist?
- Maybe...
- Guns are the devil's teeth.
Oh, but shiny though, right?
- You mock me.
- No... no, I'm not.
You're right. Guns ruin lives.
I only shoot bad guys.
That's the point of... me. Of it.
How can you tell
the good from the bad?
Um... the good ones
are usually scared.
But they push past the fear,
you know? And they do what's
right, even when it hurts.
Even when every instinct is
telling them to do nothing,
to survive.
And the good ones are hotter.
-
-
We found him out by the ridge.
Had to zap him three times
before he calmed down.
- We are a peace-loving people.
- Yet holding me hostage
can be interpreted
as an act of terrorism!
Take this upstairs.
Who knew
we would be blessed
with so many visitors today.
:
Course not. He says
there are outsiders
who don't understand our
commune, even fear us.
Fear him.
Do you?
What's Yiska going to do with that man?
He won't last
long in the hole.
Sounds less than five-star.
The root cellar,
behind the greenhouse.
That's where you'll sleep.
I sleep here.
Don't worry though, I don't snore.
Me neither, unless
there's bourbon involved.
Uh... bedpan?
Unless you want to go search
for the outhouse in the night.
Hard pass.
My first night here,
I sobbed into my pillow.
Soaked it right through.
Jen came and gave me a handkerchief
and some hot chocolate.
She didn't say anything,
she just gave it to me.
It sounds insignificant,
but it made all the difference.
- Where's Jen now?
- Once you are driven away,
there's no coming back.
Did Yiska ever mention
someone named Bobo?
Bobo?
That can't possibly be a real person.
There. You're all set.
I feel a real connection
with you, Courtney.
Yeah, ditto.
: Sorry!
I hope that was clean!
: Hi.
- Brought you a blankie.
- What took you so long?
The mani-pedis here
are incredible.
- What happened to you?
- Saw a weird light,
blacked out,
woke up in a creepy chapel.
Yeah, you saw
those creepy crows?
Mondays, amiright? Come on!
So, have you got eyes on Lou?
His acolytes call him Yiska.
That's a Navajo name.
Well, what's their word
for "sleazy demon pervert"?
They think he's some kind
of benevolent leader.
Typical brainwashing.
Any word on a weapon
that could scare Bobo?
Bobo.
That narcissist finally figure out
that his stupid
fur coat won't protect him?
Who in the world
is this "Bobo"?
A common enemy.
I have no enemies...
...that are in anything...
: ...but pieces.
So what do you think?
Sacrifice?
Or a seriously
off-the-hook bat mitzvah.
You have betrayed the peaceful
people of this place.
You are no longer
welcome.
Just like you weren't welcome
- back in Purgatory, huh?
- My name is Wynonna Earp.
I come from a long line of Earps
who have been hunting down
the likes of your leader for decades.
The Heir?
Seriously, Yiska,
what is going on?
Fate. Irony.
And inevitably, boredom.
Let's get this show on
the road, shall we, Eve?
-
- May you find safe passage.
- So that's it? We're free to go?
- I wouldn't put it that way.
Oh, what a night.
Does anybody have a phone? No?
Don't all answer at once.
Eve must have convinced them to
drop me in the middle of town
to look into this.
Voicemail... which
Dolls never listens to
because he says it's antiquated.
Yo, dummy, stop being a dingus
and call me back.
And please be OK, also.
Are you alright there?
What's that?
It's like Sharpie.
It won't come off.
Find anything?
Every single girl on
this list? Found dead,
scattered around the Ghost
River Triangle. Autopsies say
that they were toyed
with and then killed
by animals that had gone rogue.
- Rabies?
- No. Just... torture.
Like, every single bone
in their body broken,
their skin licked off.
This is why I don't do pets.
Have you seen
the last word on the list?
Yeah. "Help."
Eve and the rest of those
girls are still out there.
With lunatic Lou.
Delinquents and runaways.
I mean, it could have
just as easily been me back then,
got sucked into this asshat's scheme.
Whiskey Jim said he has a weapon.
So do you. A big gun.
- I lost it in the Pine Barrens.
- What?!
Along with my partner.
Why is he not back yet?
Maybe they didn't
drop him in Purgatory.
Which means he's
alone. In the woods.
Which he hates.
Shit!
- Hey.
- OK, so where were we?
Because I seem to think it was
something about, like, candles,
you trying to get me into a sexy
black dress... Something's wrong.
A lot of things
might be wrong.
Dolls and Wynonna and her gun...
What is the deal
with that gun anyway?
: We have reports
of a pink, four-doored sedan
- Did she say pink?
Earp! Earp!
Wynonna!
Oh, shit. Oh, come on.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
-
- Yeah!
Here we go. Let's go.
Come on!
One, two, three.
Alright. Stay cool.
- Stay cool.
-
Yes. Right.
Freezing my ass off. OK.
Keys, keys, keys, keys.
OK, baby. Gimme. Come on.
-
- Go. Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come
on. Come on, heat, let's go.
Oh, damn.
I really hope you're not
as hungry as you look.
-
- Hey! Alright.
OK! Nice doggie.
Nice doggie.
This... is not good.
-
-
Hey...
You're doing 140 in a 50 zone.
Licence and registration?
Well, it's me, Officer Haught.
And I have neither of those things.
- Oh, boy.
- How about an explanation, huh?
If there is any kindness
in you, you will arrest me,
and quick.
Sorry there, Stone Cold.
Not getting off so easy.
Dolls? DOLLS!
How could you just disappear?
That's impossible.
What am I talking about?
I disappeared. DOLLS!
The wolf will hear us.
You're alive. What wolf?
Sh. Looking for this?
And here I thought you
were just happy to see me.
Oh, I have missed you!
Oh, you're freezing.
-
- Oh, that wolf.
Oh, yeah. Let's go.
Wrong way, Earp. Where are you going?
- To save the hippie chicks.
- From what?
The weapon!
So where do you
think you're going?
I thought I'd visit
my Mama's grave in Valdosta.
- 'Bout time, I reckon.
- Bullshit.
- You're headed northeast.
- I have vanquished my enemy.
I have taken her horse.
I am finished here, Waverly.
- This was your plan the whole time.
- No, this was your plan.
- You told me to learn to drive.
- I didn't mean leave Purgatory
without a word!
I do hate goodbyes.
Look, we need you, OK?
She needs you.
She has Dolls.
Can't you at least try?
I mean, I'm trying with Nicole.
Difference is,
she adores you back.
What are you doing?
The world we worked
so hard to create
has been sullied by outsiders.
We must disband.
Become pure.
Then we can begin to rebuild.
You are so great and wise.
Sisters, he's lying...
Always so high and mighty.
Your impurity was poison to us all...
Eve.
The women cast out from the
cult were devoured by an animal!
Of course. The wolf, the crow.
- Get it?
- Not even a little.
Yiska. In Navajo
mythology there are humans
that can take the form
of animals. Skinwalkers.
We're a long way
from Navajo territory.
Yeah, but smack in the middle
of the Ghost River Triangle.
It would explain how Lou
managed to protect himself
against Bobo's vengeance.
How did you find this place
again? I had to get freaky
- with a warm light.
- Please. I'm a walking GPS.
I pinged that shit.
Nice.
-
- You came back.
You watched me take a bath.
That shit bonds for life.
I knew our
connection was real.
Totes. You wanna tell me
about this shitty face paint?
They mark all
those who are prey.
And Yiska marked us all, before he left.
- What a prince.
- He will rise again
to make us clear once more!
God, you're such a moron.
He cast us out, Margo. He lied to us.
When we leave here, we die.
Hey. I didn't.
-
-
Earp, I think we just
lured the Skinwalker
back to a whole bunch
of free-range dinners.
- Hey. Can you find him?
- Cowards always have
an escape route. And sometimes...
a snowmobile.
Earp, go with Eve.
The only way to stop this
Skinwalker is to sever its ties
- with its captor, OK?
- So, kill Lou's revenant ass?
Yeah. Business as usual. Come on.
Alright, ladies.
Up the stairs.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
This way!
- : Now! Come on!
-
Yiska, stop!
Lou!
What are you? A devil?
: I'm a god!
I have outlived three Heirs.
Bitch here makes it four.
You can't hide
from me. Or this.
Who said anything
about hiding?
-
- Bear! Big bear! Bear!
- Sayonara, bitches.
- Eve, the gun!
- It won't stop the bear!
- Not the bear!
- Just the asshole!
-
AH! Eve! Eve!
-
-
Thank you.
What the hell was that?
The impossible.
So I found an old photo
in Waverly's research,
of Lou's first wife.
Her name was Tadewi.
She was a horse whisperer of sorts
and there were whispers about her.
Lou was likely using her as a weapon
for over 100 years.
An actual Skinwalker.
Seems like the Ghost River
Triangle is playing host
to a whole realm of
supernatural phenomenon. This...
This is huge.
She didn't remember anything
- since Lou found her, huh?
- Uh-uh.
Yeah. Prolonged
psychological trauma
can cause amnesia.
She may have been brainwashed. Or...
- ...she's lying.
- She's not lying.
We thought she was dead.
- Wynonna...
- We gave up.
- We stopped looking for her.
- Wynonna.
We don't know anything for sure.
There could be 1000 reasons why
Peacemaker worked in
her hand, you hear me?
Or there's one.
Eve?
Come on.
You're coming home with me.
You can't leave me
Without an ending to this story
You can't leave me this way
You can't
Hey.
So, listen, you gave Doc a car and...
Well, the thing is that
