Why don't you buy it?
The hair of the dog.
Look .... it is real.
From the scalps of the Comanche.
It cost you three pesos.
Give me my doll. My doll.
It's mine.
Comanche.
Guard this woman well. I will claim her
later.
Perhaps we can come to an understanding?
A ransom maybe? I have money. I will
pay.
Plenty money. Plenty gold.
Plenty Comanche scalps.
How many times Mr Rose you get $50?
You know my name?
It's wise to know the name of those who
collect gold for scalps.
No. Mercy great chief. Mercy.
Don't shoot.
Many soldiers coming.
Hold your fire.
They have crossed into the United
States.
Comanche. - Get the scalps on the
wagons. Hurry up.
Burn them.
Untie them.
Let them go.
Give them horses.
Comanche scalps in the wagon.
Mexicans are enemies but white eyes
are worse.
For each Comanche scalp take ten of
theirs.
- Why didn't you save those scalps?
- I was saving my own.
We got company.
Coming fast.
Comanche?
You don't see them until they're on top
of you. Is the patrol out?
No, Mr Read just us.
Something's spooking those riders.
Better wait and see.
It's Downey and his bunch.
- Friends of yours?
- Not exactly.
What's your hurry Downey? - Comanche.
- They jumped us.
- Why are you in Indian territory?
Hunting, there's no law against it.
- There ain't no law here.
- We're west of the law.
There's the law of the Comanche knife.
Don't rile them
I'd like to rile them real good.
- It's Peters and Flanagan,
- How did they escape?
Thought they was dead for sure.
We were spread-eagle against the wheels.
They had brush around our legs.
- A Comanche came.
- Quanah?
- He told them to let us go.
- Never seen a face like his.
His eyes cut wholes right through me.
They gave us horses and turned us loose.
Quanah's trying to tell us something.
I know what I'd like to tell him.
I know. You have made a career of
Indian hating.
I am telling you, stay out of this
territory.
- Escort them to camp.
- Hold on Read.
What about our wagons?
The whole regiment couldn't get them.
Read ....
You really aiming to keep me away?
- First you had me kicked out ......
- You were no good.
They say you are pretty good with a gun.
Just how good?
I manage to stay alive.
I asked you a question.
How good?
That's your gamble.
One time I would have called and drawn.
Now here....
I say you are Indian lover not fit to
be around whites.
Nobody moves.
- Who are you soldier boy?
- Second Lieutenant John French.
Now move or you are under arrest.
Alright soldier boy.
- I'll be seeing you Read.
- You probably will.
You two ride out, see if you can save
any of our scalps.
There's headquarters.
The General is probably waiting. Thanks
French and don't forget ...
- ... you're on Downey's list now.
- I'll remember.
- Hello sir.
- You got here fast.
You said it was urgent so we cut across
the plains.
- With Comanche loose?
- We travelled by night.
They hold up at night. Bad medicine.
- Day is going to be worse.
- What's the trouble sir?
Everything happens at once.
Comanche are raiding again.
John Ward is here from Washington.
Senor Gonzalez from the Mexican embassy.
Ward wants martial law. I don't.
- But he has the power.
- Big medicine eh?
Let's see just how big.
We signed the peace treaty in 1848 which
terminated hostilities with Mexico.
In 1853 the Gatson Purchase,
We paid $10 million for parts of
this territory.
These treaties guaranteed we would stop
the Comanche raids into Mexico.
And return all captives and property.
President Grant told me to stay
until accomplished.
If the Comanche don't keep in peacefully, we make them.
There's thousands. Who's gonna tell them?
You are.
- I don't think so.
- The Army pays you?
As a scout not as a politician. - Read.
General Miles says you are the best man
and this is the biggest outbreak.
Washington and the nation wants
it stopped.
Preposterous this fighting should go
on forever.
It's been going on for over 200 years.
Senor Read is correct.
The hatred with the Comanche is ancient
noone, in truth, can say when it began.
When the Spaniards first explored in
The Indians had a tribal belief the
white man would come.
It would be something special - a god.
The white man came and it was special.
He discovered silver and forced the
Indians to work the mines.
The slave labour paid for by beatings at
the hands of the overseers.
The Comanche got sick and rebelled.
They massacred the Spaniards.
By the time the Comanche and rest had
avenged themselves ...
There wasn't much left of the
settlements they had.
There wasn't much left of the people
either. Pretty messy business.
The Spaniards then offered a bounty for
every Comanche scalp.
Ranging from $25 to $100 a scalp.
and the 25 was for a baby.
Correction senor. Since our
independence ...
The Mexicans have revoked it.
No longer does Mexico pay for scalps.
Your government is to complimented.
Renegades on both sides got rich. They
made big business out of hunting.
Collecting scalps like pelts from
animals.
Once they staged a big fiesta ...
... invited over 400 Indians ...
... men, women and children. They
massacred them all.
So that's how it is. Comanche kill
Mexicans to get even,
Mexicans kill Comanche for that and
it becomes a way of life.
I can see that but the Comanche have to
stop or we will be forced to make them.
If they knew the bounty for the scalps
had gone it would help.
That's right you could base peace talks
on that.
I don't know. I think troops are the
answer.
They can't go on killing each other
for ever.
The Comanche are known as lords of the
plains and they are very proud peoples.
Maybe they would talk peace but they
would go again without honourable terms.
As President Grant's emissary I am able
to make peace and to get it ratified.
Naturally no agreement is good
unless it's fair to both.
If we can only get through to Quanah
Parker. - Parker?
Parker? - The chief of the antelopes,
the deadliest tribe.
If he stopped all the rest would.
Parker, that's an American name.
It's his mothers family name.
- How could any American girl ...
- She was kidnapped.
- Sounds like a frontier legend.
- Not a legend sir.
- Have you tried to reach Quanah?
- Sent out runners twice.
- They didn't come back.
- How about Quanah ...
... Will he keep his word?
He's never violated it. He will keep
his if you keep yours.
My integrity is equal to that of
Quanah's.
It's a pretty high plane Commissioner.
If you mean it I will try and find
Quanah.
Or let him find me. I will travel
by day.
You know since Quanah attacked at
Medicine Lodge ....
... no American has faced him and lived.
- Until today.
Downey's hunters were captured and
Quanah freed them.
I've never met him but him freeing those
two men is a sign of peace.
It's your hair. You're not worried
about losing it.
I'll tell the quartermaster to sort out
supplies. Who's going?
Next time lets play with four aces.
- Him.
- Puffer? That old buzzard.
He knows the country as well as I do.
What are you doing here? Hiding
from the Indians?
At it again? Get to the quartermaster's
tent.
Get some jerk beef, biscuit, beans,
plenty of cartridges.
- Where we going ... gold mine?
- Enough for two weeks.
Where we going Jim?
Where we going? What about the
gold mine?
A social call to the Comanche.
Don't mention them critters to me.
I am a sick man.
I'd ask them General for a leave of
absence but you couldn't do without me.
- You'd get yourself lost.
- Puffer, just a minute.
Got something for you. Got it in
Santa Fe.
- What is it?
- Open it and see.
What could it be?
It's the oddest scalp I ever saw.
It's not a scalp, it's a wig.
- What's it for?
- To keep your bald head warm.
I am sick and tired of hearing you
complain all the time.
You look almost human. - Why you ....
Take a look for yourself.
I bet I am the only dude with an
extra scalp.
Might come in handy some time.
Makes a difference. Long time since I
enjoyed being in cold air.
Good. You wear it no matter.
I am not waving the flag, just
remember this.
All out war or peace depend upon your
efforts.
Thank you . Back in two weeks or
maybe less.
So long. Normally I would say
stay away from Comanche.
This is different sir.
- Ready Puffer.
- Always.
Let's go.
Good luck Read. You going to need it.
- Why do you say that?
- I got my reasons.
Who are you?
My name is Downey Commissioner.
Art Downey.
I was Chief Scout til I retired.
Retired? What do you do now?
Prospecting. Buffalo hunting.
What do you know about the Comanche?
Well I have lived out here for 20 years.
I taught Jim Read all he knows.
You inferred he would fail. Why?
It's nothing personal Jim's one of the
best. It's the thinking that's wrong.
You don't send one men to talk to
a tribe.
You just don't do it.
What do you do?
The Comanche are just plain savages ...
... they live by force and obey by force.
Reason and they think you are weak.
You got to show them you are stronger.
They respect force.
Just like they respect a cavalry
regiment.
I said the same thing to General
Miles and Read. They felt otherwise.
You are the only person who thinks as
I do.
As I said I lived out here for 20 years
and scouted for 6.
I learnt about Indians.
Why send one cousin to do business
with another?
Downey ....
Yes sir.
You are talking in circles. Whom
are you referring to?
Jim Read and Quanah Parker.
I hope I misheard you?
- You say Read is cousin to a savage?
- First cousin.
Their mothers were sisters.
Why wasn't I informed?
- You mean you weren't?
- I was not.
That makes it worse than ever.
Two cousins. Dealing for and against
the Government.
Perhaps I should speak to General Miles
about recalling Read.
Dang them Comanche ain't never around
when you want them.
.... is on the warpath and time is
brief ....
.... Read knows that Quanah is brave
and just ....
.... they stake their trust on a firm
belief ....
You know Jim, I can't help looking at
this store here.
I'm getting good natured quicker than it
takes a rooster to make a chicken grin.
It's a Spanish girl. What is she doing
here?
You understand English? Comprende
inglis?
Where did you come from?
I ask you, where do you live?
What'll we do the poor thing is plum
loco?
- Come on.
- No.
I will escape again. It is better
to die.
The blood of my parents is on your
hands. Take them away.
I will not go. You will not do this
to me.
We're your friends we are not going
to harm you.
Sorry if I hurt you.
Are you hungry?
I have not eaten since ...
- I don't know when.
- Rustle up some grub Puffer.
Feel better.
Muchos gracios senor.
It is a terrible country.
No, it's not the country.
To me .... it is.
It's frightening.
Where do you live?
Durango, senor.
- What's your name?
- Margarita Alvarez.
Where are your parents?
- The Comanche ...
- Massacred?
- Yes ....
- I am sorry.
Comanche ....
.... savages.
All should be killed to stop this
murder and torture.
No senorita. That is not the answer.
- You defend the Comanche?
- Try to explain them maybe.
You think they are humans to be treated
that way?
Most of them can, yes.
You think it was necessary for my
parents to be killed by them?
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I hate Comanche.
I will always hate them.
- Puffer.
- I ain't deaf.
- They ain't shooting at us.
- Get up there.
It's Downey's bunch.
Yeh, a little scalping party.
We're friends.
What's your tribe?
Antalapa.
Quanah Parker's tribe.
Can you take us to the Chief of the
antelopes?
We come to talk peace.
The white man brings no harm to
our chief?
When we meet you chief will need no more
weapons than I have now.
Then I will take the white man to
our chief.
The camp of your chief is not far from
here?
One day? Two days?
He's not at the camp.
- He rides with many warriors.
- Returning from a raid?
The last before the cold and snow
set in.
Women light the victory fires even now.
We will rest here.
When the sun rises we will ride
together to find your chief.
I will tell him when he is before his
warriors ...
That he ....
I hope he is alright. We might spend
days looking for Quanah without him.
Never seen so much paint in all my born
days.
What d'ya mean?
Sure glad I got me an extra spell.
We are in no trouble but that girl is.
We came to talk peace.
You know, I know it, he knows it but
do the Comanche?
Let the young braves kill the whites in
the tribal manner.
We came to talk treaty with the great chief.
Is this the way to talk? Kill them.
My brother still lives. We return to
our stronghold.
If my brother dies ... the white men's
deaths will not be as quick as his.
We will see your tongue pulled out
by the root.
They are coming.
Quanah brings many things. There is
enough for all.
- The western ridge and here's the camp.
- Yep. I figured.
We've been looking for this hideout for
years. - No talk.
- That dirty ugly face.
- Silent.
Just one of those days.
It's gonna be worse if Quanah's brother
dies before he speaks.
Morning star.
The white men.
I must speak to Quanah.
There are many horses and mules.
Many guns, many bullets, much powder.
Cloths of many colours. Mexican captives
for those who need them.
There are two white faces.
Later we will find out how long they can
live under endless torment.
Great spirit ...
Mighty sun god ...
Here is the body.
His blood has been spilt without reason.
Hear the sorrow and grief of his family.
There is no joy in that song.
Let the sound reach your heart.
Let this youth live.
Give the word now. The white eyes
must die.
By nightfall those Comanche will be
roaring drunk.
Worst varmints on the plains.
Ever see am man when they have finished?
- Shut up.
We have more plans for you.
Torture is for enemies. We come
in peace.
I bring big medicine from my chief
to Quanah.
Quanah cares nothing for your chief or
his medicine.
He grieves for soon he will hear the
death song of his brother.
It is your death song white man.
The wig scares them. They think it's
your scalp. Take it off.
Has the evil spirit turned you into
women? - His medicine too big.
Your medicine not so big.
Now you suffer for two.
Unbind him.
Unbind him.
These did not lift weapons against my
brother.
They drove away other white men.
They have no enemies in my camp.
My brother lives.
Come with me.
Sabby, black jack.
Sabby, food. Sabby, squaw,
Nice, very nice. I got me a widow woman
in San Antoine.
When she sets eyes on me and my new
hair,
She'll be a shakin and shiverin and a
sight to behold.
And vice versa.
Speak ...
I come to ask the great chief to a
peace council.
The Americans?
Comanche are at war only with Mexicans.
There is much bad blood and fighting.
My people have never first drawn a bow.
Or fired a gun. But there is bad blood
and fighting.
The Americans have taken the place where
the grass is thickest and timber best.
Instead of hunting game they kill our
braves.
For camp fires they burn our villages.
Our women wail and cut their hair
short for the dead.
Yet Comanche are not weak and blind.
They kill Americans like Mexicans.
Their scalps hang in our tepees and
the white women cry.
And our women laugh.
But it was not begun by us.
The Americans sent out the first
soldier. We sent out the second.
Many seasons ago when the war between
Americans and Mexicans ended ...
... The Americans gave much gold for this
land. It belongs to Americans.
Soon there were be American forts
and soldiers,
Many Americans will come here to plant
grain and raise cattle.
And dig the earth for gold and silver.
This has been agreed by the Mexicans and
Americans? - Yes.
No Comanche?
Gold was given. A line has been changed
in the earth.
The Americans and Mexicans agreed.
No Comanche.
We were here long before the Americans.
And Mexicans but noone thought to
agree with us.
Yet we are not a conquered people.
Noone has defeated us.
But ... our numbers still do not
increase.
The Americans are without nothing just
like weeds.
And drops of rain. No end to them.
Time has come to walk the path of
the Americans.
This has long been on my mind.
Americans are brave. They know many
things we must learn from them.
Or the sun will set on us forever.
The sound of your words is good.
There is another thing.
My country has pledged to stop the
Comanche raids into Mexico.
And to free all captive Americans.
The Mexicans still collect gold from the
government for Comanche scalps.
Should I treat them as brothers?
They will no longer buy Comanche scalps.
I ask you to call the Americans and
Mexicans ... brothers.
You ask me to be better than my enemies.
I ask you to be greater.
A great man can grant great favours.
I have heard these words before.
- Where?
Many seasons ago ... from the wife of
my father.
The wife of your father and the wife
of my father were sisters.
With the name of Parker.
- We are friends.
- And cousins.
I will call a meeting of the council.
Ohh err ... that young Mexican girl.
No harm will come to her?
Oarka and Morning Star care for her
as captive,
She belongs to the tribe.
I'd like to help her.
Others desire her.
One man has offered four horses for her.
A man must have fire in his mind to
offer four horses.
Black cloud.
I do not question the wisdom of the
council.
It is tribal custom that warriors can
buy their captives.
American's ask us to call Mexicans
brothers and stop our war.
And return the captives unharmed.
Americans ask us ... a race that shoots
without orders from their chiefs.
That kills buffalos it cannot eat.
That fouls the clear waters and changes
our earth ...
Until we cannot live on it anymore.
I do not think of Americans, I think
only of Comanche.
And the children of Comanche and
the children from them.
The Americans are here and will stay.
We cannot drive them out.
They will grow strong while we will not.
We must learn from them.
So our children will not hunger and
they will be warm in winter.
So they will grow strong as the
Americans are strong.
I have told my white cousin that we will
lay down our weapons.
There will be an end to the fighting.
For  a treaty with honour.
Pah, a treaty with honour.
I am among your warriors and your camp.
The end of my time may come today,
that is in your power.
I do not speak with a crooked tongue.
My chief has pledged the word of my
nation to yours.
And will their be laws to follow like
a conquered people?
There will be laws. Those that obey them
will have the same rights as Americans,
Those who disobey will be punished.
The same as Americans are.
Your chief shall know my decision.
I walk the path of Americans.
Those who this displeases, leave me now.
This is your right.
But those who follow me must not
violate my word.
If they do, they will be my enemies.
I will hunt them and kill them myself.
It is Comanche custom that no man
leaves unless others follow.
- The warriors will follow me.
- I will not ...
... if you make peace with Americans and
Mexicans.
There are others who think as I do.
Black Cloud. You have a head for war
and nothing else.
Our paths now separate.
You and your band leave. Take all
your ponies.
Go now and take your braves with you.
The girl and captives stay here.
There is a treaty. They will be free.
It would be better if they had died
in battle.
- You sure you never played black jack?
- One man good.
Beat two kings back to back.
Black Jack.
Doggone. That was my last silver
dollar too.
How do you feel?
I am tired. I am frightened.
Everybody gets frightened.
- You?
- Sure.
Never would I think it of you senor.
Not frightened.
Not inside of you frightened.
- It does not fit.
- It fits.
Lie down to see if you can get
some rest.
- What happened?
- We are all heading out tonight.
Quanah wants Ward and General Miles
for a council.
Will the come they might think it too
risky? - Not the General.
- Ward is very anxious about the treaty.
- What about her?
She will have to stay until we get back.
Safer anyway with Black Cloud on
the loose.
Quanah is sending a couple of guides
with us.
I'll be back in three days.
Get the saddlebags and horse. I want to
be out before the moon comes up.
- Black Cloud wont attack at night.
- We aren't taking chances.
It's too important.
- Maybe we get a medal for this Jim?
- I been thinking Puffer.
Maybe we are wasting our time with
the army.
If a man's country is in trouble he
helps or he ain't a man.
Yes but what about the mining. All
that gold.
If the USA seeks to make a messenger out
of me then that there gold can wait.
Stop asking those foolish questions and
let me out to those horses.
Yes ...
- I'll tell you when I get back.
- You are going away?
Only for a couple of days.
You will take me with you.
You heard what Quanah said. You need to
stay here.
I will die before I stay alone with
Comanche.
I am afraid you don't have a choice.
No, I will not stay here.
You will be safe here with Quanah.
Out there is Black Cloud.
I have great fear.
Noone will hurt you.
It is not ... just for ... myself.
That I am afraid.
Margarita.
It is strange to find love here.
Not so strange.
You do not?
Just talk?
I do not just talk.
I do not know how to say.
With other men who sought my
heart, just nothing.
And with me?
I just say ...
Say it.
It's a fire inside of me.
I can't believe it is so soon,
So much has happened.
I have not had time to understand.
When I get back, I will be your husband,
you will be my wife.
I belong to you know.
In a very special way.
If anything bad happens ...
without you ...
I am so alone.
This is a good place. - Yes.
We live here like our fathers before
us and theirs before them.
We were born here. Where the wind
blows free.
There is nothing to break the light of
the sun. No enclosures and free air.
In a way your words are the same as the
fathers of my nation.
Tell your chief we want the Americans and
Comanche to live as brothers.
He will be happy to hear your words.
He wishes to be your friend.
He will return too.
There is food in your saddlebags and you
will be lead to the waterhole.
From there you go to Palador Springs.
From there you know.
Wherever I am is your home.
I'll be back.
Here medicine mound. Sacred.
Man go there to meet great spirits.
Palador Springs, more far.
Okay.
The stars are meeting ....
Black Cloud and his warriors have
been here.
- How long ago?
- Two or three hours maybe.
- Puffer.
- I'm a hurryin'.
We playum black jack?
- Sure like to get back my dollar.
- Play one game.
Silver dollar against your scalp.
- Not on your darn hope.
- No hurry.
I get when you come back.
We go back now.
When the sun leaves the sky three
times we'll be there.
I hate this darn country.
Hottie than beans in the daytime
and cold at night.
Hurry up.
- Too much smoke for a signal fire.
- Could be a cabin.
Yes it could. Let's cut over there.
Kids.
Mother and kids.
- Bad?
- Awful.
Stopping Black Cloud will be a
dirty job.
Got to get back to the troops quickly.
Better bury them.
Must be mid morning.
I reckon a bit past.
Must be close to the Springs.
I make it nearer than farther.
Guns. - Yeh, lots of them.
Part of General Miles outfit. Sure
been bushwhacked.
Found you after all.
- What do you mean?
- We were sent out to bring you in.
Then they jumped us. Comanche. About
fifty of them.
Black Cloud.
A Trooper ...
... got away ...
... raw hiding for help ...
... four or five hours ... ago.
He should be here.
We'll stay here til the Troopers arrive.
The Regiment.
Quanah, the dirty murderer.
- It wasn't Quanah, it was Black Cloud.
- No difference they are Comanche.
It's like I told you. You gotta use
force.
- No doubt about it.
- Lieutenant.
Sir. - Arrange a burial detail.
- Quanah must pay for this.
- You are making a big mistake.
- Quanah is ready for peace.
- You don't make sense.
I've just come from Quanah. I am
trying to tell you.
You are telling me nothing.
You're through.
Downey is our new chief  scout.
- Quanah's your cousin.
- What difference does that make?
When close relatives negotiate there
is the possibility of personal gain.
Oh, I see.
With Downey here we have no such
problem. We have transferred you away.
Mr Reed,
- I haven't finished with you.
- Yes, you have.
We're leaving for the canyon and Quanah.
It will be a tough forced march.
I want to get there before sundown.
Lieutenant French. - Sir.
Your troops will move parallel to mine.
Stay five miles off my wing.
If the Indians attack, we will get them
in a cross fire.
General, I must warn you again. Stay
away from that canyon.
Still trying to save your cousin's skin?
Downey, one more remark and you
will answer to me.
Lieutenant French.
Downey and Merrill will be your scouts.
Read and Puffer, mine.
You won't object if I ride with French's
column?
Commissioner, you may ride where
you please.
- Boots in saddles.
- Yes sir.
What happened after I left?
Downey convinced Ward that they
needed to use force.
Ward wired the Indian Office and the
War Department and they wired me.
Quanah surrenders or we wipe them out.
I am furious but what can I do? Both
my hands are tied.
Quanah's not going to like an ultimatum.
I'll have to tell him.
- Is that why you are leading us?
- I would be arrested if I left alone.
So would I.
I tell you. You couldn't hurt Quanah if
you stayed a month. He is impregnable.
We're not due back for 3 days. We must
catch Black Cloud.
Maybe we will be lucky.
Ride fast to Quanah. Tell him many
soldiers come for war.
Read spoke with crooked tongue.
Tell him to sound the war cry of
the Comanche braves.
I wait for his words at the end of the
canyon. Go.
What are you stopping for?
Comanche.
See them on the skyline?
Well Lieutenant, what are you
waiting for?
I don't know.
- I better notify the General.
- I will take the responsibility.
Well Lieutenant.
Well ....
Forward.
Where in blazes is that other column?
Head for Medicine Mound. You can see for
miles. Comanche only go there to die.
Forward.
See anything?
Nothing.
Not a thing.
How far is it to Quanah's camp?
Not far.
- Let's go.
- Oh, General.
I'll take you there but not them.
- You're in command until I get back.
- Sir.
Thanks.
You'll see the female he's pining for.
Female. Name of Margarita. You can
conduct his wedding.
Black Cloud.
That's French's column.
Well they have been asking for it.
- They have got them trapped now.
- I'd like a crack at them.
Go down and tell them to get away from
the fence. - Sir.
- But I don't think ....
- I'll take the responsibility.
Forward.
Get back. It's a trap.
Generals orders.
What are you afraid of soldier boy?
Get back.
I am a friend of the Comanche. I come
from Washington.
I'm your white brother.
Then it is you ...
... who bring the white-eyes to foul
our land.
No, no. I come to protect you.
No. no.
General Miles.
Listen to me General Miles.
Black Cloud will let me go if you let
him out of the canyon.
- Does your white brother let you die?
- Miles, please Miles.
Please ....
Please ....
You want to take the deal? A mans
life is at stake.
Ranchers lives are at stake, families
too. If that butcher is turned loose.
- This time Black Cloud is trapped.
- You ahead and Quanah behind.
- If Quanah stays religious.
- I'd stake my life on that.
You already have.
Black Cloud.
Here is your scout.
He has brought me your words.
Here is my answer.
Black Cloud.
You die.
Raise ...
Pistols ...
Charge.
Where did you find my hair. I've been
looking all over these rocks for it?
Ain't never found it so hard to
stay alive.
I know this man's heart. What he has
told me, I have in my heart.
I am tired of fighting. I do not want my
young men to die.
I do not want my old to wail for the
dead.
Let us be free men.
Free to chose our own teachers.
Free to follow in the religion of
our fathers.
Free to think and act for ourselves.
We will keep the peace faithfully.
Or from where the sun now stands, we
will fight no more.
Forever.
My chief wants to start with no bad
memories.
We'll make a new beginning and put
the fighting behind us.
My country has pledged it's word.
That our treaty will not be broken
by a white man.
The man who's truthful ...
