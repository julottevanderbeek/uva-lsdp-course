- Whoo!
-
Giddyup!
You gonna?
Yeah, I'm gonna.
Today?
Today.
Well, back pay
and everything?
Every last simoleon.
I think Uncle Joe
knows you're gonna.
So he knows.
You shouldn't
have told everybody
on the spread.
Then you could've
jumped him sudden
and surprise him,
And maybe
from behind.
It's no surprise.
Right to his ugly face.
Uncle Joe.
Uncle Joe, I got something
to tell you.
This here's
a free country.
If all the ugly people
in the world was thrown
in a heap...
You'd be on top.
I always liked the top.
You're meaner than a grizzly
with ticks in his ears.
I'm a grizzly bear,
all right.
You ain't got no more
milk of human kindness
than a tarantula.
And if you moved
into his tepee,
Even a drunken,
dog-robbin' Indian
would move out
'Cause he couldn't
stand the smell.
Uncle Joe, you stink.
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,
But names
will never hurt me.
I want my money.
Now you're goin'
too far, boy!
Six hundred
and forty-seven dollars.
Five years back pay.
My own flesh and blood!
Telling people
you took me in
Out of Christian kindness
when my folks died.
"Poor orphan nephew,"
you told around.
Why, I punched
When it was so hot
you could fry an egg
on a rock.
Only you're too mean
and stingy to buy grain
to keep a few chickens.
And I punched 1,000 cows
in winters so cold,
You had to chip the ice
off a horse's back
Before you could
saddle up.
Now, I told you,
I want my money.
Six hundred and
forty-seven dollars,
right now!
Them's fightin' words, boy!
Why, you fat old pig,
that's what I'm getting at.
I come to fight
for my money.
Lord,
give me strength
to bear my load.
All right, boy.
I just ain't
got it in me
To strike my own
flesh and blood.
Come on in the house
and get your money.
You mean it?
This strong
right hand of mine
would wither
If I hit my own
brother's son.
Any of the rest of you
got any speeches to make?
Good blood,
that's what he's got.
Ain't a man among you
could take one blow
From Honest
Joe Reno's
right fist.
Here's a boy needs two.
Horse or man,
its breedin' will tell.
Now, take this boy
to the bunkhouse
And care for him
tenderly.
Mike! Git up!
Show some sense, boy.
Your brains
may be addled
forever as it is.
If you force me to...
Come on!
You had enough, boy?
Blood always tells.
Buck!
Get me
that iron box
Out from
under my bed.
I think I'll pay
this boy off.
Those dice read seven!
Now look, cowboy,
we tried
to explain to you...
You lose on seven
after you make
your first point.
That's the first number.
You sent
for me, Ed?
This waddy came
into my place.
We tried to keep him
from gambling.
He don't know
a hit from a miss.
Half the time he's
betting on the "do pass"
and the "don't pass" line
At the same time.
Are you calling me ignorant?
He wanted to fight
unless we let him
buck the table.
They got $647 of my money.
And you call yourself
a marshal,
Letting those crooks
get at it?
These men
ain't crooks, boy.
Now, you make tracks
out of this town.
You understand me?
Hey, you with
the eyeshade...
I want my money.
You're crazy, boy.
You use that thing,
you won't even get
to the edge of town.
Thanks, Gid.
You going to be
in the office
in an hour?
Yeah. Jensen was in
asking about you
a while ago.
I better go
pay him off now.
All right,
Billy the Kid,
come on.
You got an
appointment...
With the judge.
- Yeah, he'll do.
- Ja.
That's where
you keep the blankets
And the medicine
for sicknesses.
There's a space
for ammunition.
Extra guns go
under the seat.
Nice job, Jensen.
Better than
the one I busted up
last trip.
I tried to make it
like I see on the boats
in the old country.
Yeah, kind of
what it is at that.
And the galley.
Pots and pans here.
Sugar, salt, flour.
Everything you need.
That's $12, right?
I already had
the lumber.
Make it 10.
Well, the sovereign
state of Texas
Appreciates
your consideration,
Jensen.
Now, if you'll
just sign the receipt
right here.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Barrel's already
full of water.
I just wanted
to see if it was
snug and tight.
Mighty handy man,
Jensen.
Yeah, I'd like
to have you come along.
Oh, no, Mr. McCool.
I got enough trouble.
See you later.
Hyah!
Me ride in that thing?
Not Ollie Jensen.
Hyah!
Your man Jensen is all right.
He did a good job
on that wagon.
Fine. I've been
talking around
everywhere
Trying to find you
a good, dependable
deputy, Gid,
But just no luck.
Seems like nobody
wants the job.
Hank Pleasant.
Pleasant.
What's in a name?
You ain't takin' me
nowhere, you hear?
Nowhere.
Justice gave him
Out of
this town forever.
He's not as tough
as he was.
Oh, no? You just
open that gate
and come see.
You know, I sent
a couple of telegrams
About getting
you a deputy.
Would you mind
holding down the fort
for a minute?
Sure.
Oh, would you mind,
uh, packing my wagon
With some guns,
blankets, some grub?
- Get right on it.
- Thanks.
What's on your mind?
Investigating.
Investigating what?
How tough you are.
You got a gun on.
Not now, I ain't.
That don't make sense.
I mean...
Well, I ain't scared of you.
You know that,
don't you?
I mean,
I know I was wrong.
I shouldn't
have acted
the way I did,
But you understand
I ain't scared of you,
don't you?
When I was your age,
it was real important
That nobody think
I was scared of anything.
Then I, uh,
I grew up.
Come on out.
I'm doing 10 days.
Or $50.
I'm offering you a job
that you can earn $100 on.
A hundred?
Also, you can get
yourself killed.
But of course, you're
not afraid of anything.
What do you
want me to do?
What I tell you to.
All right,
start telling.
Well, first you can
get us a couple
of cups of coffee.
You're Bill Reno's boy,
aren't you?
Yeah. Why?
I knew Bill.
Yeah, I hear you
whipped your Uncle Joe.
Yeah.
Made him holler uncle.
Aw, he must
be getting old.
The mean old
bull buffalo
Could've whipped
a dozen like you
in his prime.
He even whipped me once...
And I could always handle
at least 11 like you.
Coffee's good.
I just don't
make you out.
You'll grow.
You giving me
this break
because, uh...
'Cause you liked
my old man?
I heard a lot of lead
whistle while your pa
was at my elbow.
So I'm putting
a stack of chips
On the proposition that
you're not all big mouth...
There's a streak
of man in you.
I guess I gotta take
that kind of talk
from you.
You're doing me
a big favor.
You don't have to take
anything from me
If you feel that
you're man enough
to handle it.
No luck on that
deputy thing.
Hey. He's supposed
to be in that cell.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I'm sorry
about the deputy.
- I got my dep.
- What?
He's it.
Are you crazy?
Well, possibly.
My ear sure hurts.
Know who belted me?
Yeah. I did.
Mike, would you
get the marshal
a cup of coffee?
Never mind.
I'll get it.
Mike, would you
take a look and see
what's outside?
How much
you paying him?
Oh, the usual.
I know human nature.
I got another 100
that says that kid won't
come through for you.
I'll take that bet.
Might as well
load him up.
Never seen anything
like it before
in my life.
Yep.
What kind of a rig
do you call that?
Had it built special
right here
in San Carlos.
We got trouble.
He says he won't
leave that cell alive.
Afraid of hanging, huh?
Well, those kind
usually are.
Big, tough,
rough murderers,
afraid to die.
So that's why you
built that wagon.
And that's why you want me
to help you haul prisoners
to the pen in Huntsville.
- That's right.
- Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.
Say, McCool, if it's all
the same to you...
Well, it isn't the same.
You gave me your word.
All arrangements
have been made.
I'm notifying the warden
and the governor.
I don't figure you
for a welcher.
I wasn't figuring
on welching.
I just figure you can
get someone else.
Well, I'm sorry,
Mike, I can't.
Now, are you gonna
give us a hand?
Yeah.
All right.
Just don't take
any chances.
This prisoner's
a murderer.
Killed a 12-year-old boy,
among others.
So you got help,
did you?
Well, you'll need it.
You come in here,
somebody's
gonna die.
I'm warnin' you.
I'll kill you with my boots,
My hands,
my bare feet
if I have to.
All right, Pleasant, let's go.
You're next, boy.
I'll break you
like a stick.
Come on.
Come on.
I want to hear
your back snap.
Get up!
Get up.
I ain't leavin'.
I ain't leavin'!
Get up!
You got those handcuffs?
All right.
Well, he's earned
his money already.
Aah! Why don't you
just shoot me here?
I don't want to hang!
We might just
oblige, Pleasant.
Now, you come on.
Climb aboard.
Thanks for
softening him up.
You behave yourself,
Pleasant, for
a couple of days,
And I'll fit you
to a nice comfortable
Oregon boot.
Ain't no such thing
as a comfortable
leg iron.
Thanks, Marshal.
Good luck, kid.
Wire me when
you get there.
That 100 I'm paying
the kid looks mighty safe,
doesn't it?
I wouldn't be
in his boots
for 1,000.
I'll see you
when I pick up the 100.
Looks like they
give old cousin Hank
a good pastin'.
Nobody does
that to my brother.
Took all of 'em,
for sure.
Yeah, all of them.
Shoot.
Somewhere between
here and Huntsville,
We're gonna
spring Cousin Hank
from that wagon.
In the meantime,
let's pay a call
on that marshal
That helped them
gang up
on Brother Hank.
Afternoon,
gentlemen.
I understand strangers
have to check their guns
when they're in town?
That's right.
Here, I'll take them.
Oh!
Sure parted his hair,
Cousin Aaron.
He got off easy.
Where you figuring
on camping tonight?
That little valley
looks good.
I need some water.
Drink?
Got any whiskey?
- I'll lead
the way out.
- All right.
They're movin' again.
Your blanket's
right over here,
Pleasant.
Sorry you didn't
find my food
too appetizing.
The thought of hangin'
kind of takes
my appetite.
Never could understand
that "hearty breakfast"
stuff about prisoners.
Neither could I.
You bed down
over there.
How do you feel?
I'm all right.
A little sleepy.
Hey, hold on there.
What do you think
I've got you along for?
You expecting trouble?
Yeah. Any prison wagon
is trouble.
All the time.
On every trip.
Now, there are those
that would spring a prisoner
If they could just for laughs.
Then there are the others
that are relatives,
friends that...
Well, they're just bent
on beating the law
out of what's theirs.
So one of us
has to stay awake.
Yeah, that's right.
You can take
the first watch.
Yeah, right up
between those two rocks,
that looks pretty good.
That way you can see
anybody coming up,
And they can't take
a free shot at you.
Better keep this fire
going, too.
I'll spell you
in about four hours.
Oh, by the way,
I'll be in the wagon.
That way, the prisoner
won't be able to tell
whether I'm watching or not.
I can take
that fella
on the horse.
Suppose you
just wound him.
Suppose you miss him.
They'll kill Hank.
And we'd be in
for a wing-ding fight.
Time and place
ain't right yet.
Gotta get 'em both.
We gotta be sure.
Well, we're still
ahead of 'em.
She ain't been by yet.
Looks like we'll have
some waiting.
If you like, you can
get out and stretch.
You heard him.
Get on out.
Saw some prairie hens
about a quarter mile back.
Maybe we can scare up
a few around here.
Yeah.
We can roast 'em.
I like mine fried.
They're splitting up.
Now we can take them.
Get him
on the first shot.
No need to worry
about the other one.
- He's headed
right this way.
-
That makes it easy.
Just leave him to me.
Shoot him
in the belly.
I want him
to die hard.
You head around to the wagon
and kill the other one.
MAN: Hyah, boy!
McCool?
He'll be along.
My name's Reno.
All right.
Everybody out, gentlemen.
Hurry it up.
Transfer to
the Huntsville wagon.
Come on. Move.
Amigo,
it's a privilege.
The name is
Angel Dominguez.
Hello, Angel. They, uh,
clipped your wings, huh?
Ah, si.
- McCool?
- That's right.
I'm Travis.
I brought your prisoners.
Sign.
R.C. Crawford,
Angel Dominguez.
There you are.
Here's the key.
You Crawford?
R.C. Crawford
is the name.
This is a disgrace...
A railroad commissioner
shackled to a goat stealer.
Someone will pay for this.
All right, Mike.
Water 'em down,
fit 'em with a Oregon boot,
and get 'em loaded.
It's a good thing
you didn't shoot.
That sure was close.
Now, you remember
about that Gid.
He's the best gun
in 10 states.
He would've been
the best dead gun
in 10 states
If that stage
hadn't shown up.
People tried to take
prisoners away from him
before and they died.
Maybe with more prisoners
to look after,
We'll have a better chance
to get at him.
How's it going?
Well, no problem...
So far.
Could that be
Mike Reno?
Could be.
Heard about him.
Kind of
hot to handle, isn't he?
Well, we got a
hot prisoner along.
Sort of
evens things out.
Hank Pleasant.
- That's right.
- Good luck.
Only luck you have
with the likes of him
Or any other prisoners
is to keep 'em in chains.
All safe and secure, huh?
You betcha.
Senor Sheriff,
My guitarra, por favor.
Please. My guitarra.
All right, Pleasant.
Climb aboard.
I hope it's all right.
- I'm kind of partial to music.
- Gracias, senor.
You've got company,
Pleasant.
Ain't you gonna
help me up, too?
Anybody laughs
at Hank Pleasant
loses their teeth.
But, senor Pleasant,
I didn't mean to.
I'm only a happy Mexican.
MCCOOL:
All right, Pleasant.
Remember,
they're your guests.
Of course.
Take it easy, my friend.
We're all in the same boat...
Wagon, I should say.
I know a lot of people
in this state...
Connections.
I can help you.
What are you here for,
the ride?
Enemies, political enemies
who stooped
to the lowest tactics
To bring R.C. Crawford down,
but...
R.C. Crawford
will rise again.
We all gonna have a nice time.
Amigos, my heart is so happy
that I am almost sad.
He's been talkin' like
that ever since
we left the jail.
Sometimes I envy him.
Just so he keeps it
to himself.
They should camp
the other side of
stone junction tonight.
- We'll get 'em tomorrow.
- Yeah.
I got just the spot
picked out.
Try one, my friend.
If it were convenient,
I'd buy you a drink.
Maybe I can
arrange that.
If that means violence,
count me out.
R.C. Crawford uses this.
You know, senor,
I am the same way.
My head rules me.
Sometimes
my heart takes over,
but I'm always sorry.
I suppose it was your heart
that ruled you
When you stole
the goats, huh?
No, senor, my head.
Going to the pen
for trying to steal goats.
You call that
using your head?
But of course, senor.
My cousin Tico,
he was caught stealing
only two horses,
And they hung him
by the highest rock.
You know, like this.
Pleasant!
Whoa! Whoa!
Pleasant! Cool off!
- You just cool off.
- He was makin' fun of me!
No reason to kill him.
He knows they're
gonna hang me.
Man's sensitive.
He's probably afraid
of rope burns.
You do that once more,
I'll pop your eyes out
of your head!
You try that once more,
Pleasant, and you're never
gonna reach Huntsville.
Do you hear me?
Now you keep quiet.
But I was only
telling the story
about my cousin Tico.
You saw him hang?
Many people did.
They come
from all over.
The marshal,
he even charged
admission.
Will you shut up?
It seems so barbaric.
They let my cousin Tico
say his last few words.
What did he say?
He say he was very happy
that so many people came.
I'm warnin' you.
It make feel him
very important.
One more word.
He had very seldom
ever felt important before.
Whoa. Whoa.
Keep an eye on 'em.
Sorry to
inconvenience you,
gentlemen.
We're going to be
making a stop
at Stone Junction.
You just might have
some friends there.
Indeed I do, Constable.
I have friends
everywhere.
They will be shocked at
this shoddy treatment.
The reward
for five years
of public service.
A reward?
For why such
a strange reward?
Because those big brains
of his weren't working
quite fast enough.
CRAWFORD:
The greatest brain
is of no avail
Against treachery
and broken promises,
But this gross wrong
will soon be righted.
Me, too, senor.
Only one year.
Like my uncle,
I learn to be a cook
in the prison kitchen.
Then maybe I can get
a job in Huntsville.
Amigos, this is
a big privilege
for a poor man like me.
Hyah!
Whoa.
Keep an eye on 'em.
I'll go in and
get the prisoner.
Hope we have to
make no more stops
after we leave this place.
Nothin' between here
and Huntsville
But rattlesnake
and sagebrush.
What a beautiful pueblo.
It's the ugliest place
I ever seen.
So many friendly people.
Uh, these poor people
having to eke out a living
In this god-forsaken place.
What're you looking for,
a brass band?
Someday I'll have one,
my friend.
The crowd
will be shouting,
"R.C. Crawford
for governor," they'll shout.
MAN: Hey, jailbird,
Why don't you
flap your wings and fly?
Huh?
ALL:  Yeah, fly!
They're shouting, all right.
Yeah! Free transportation
to Huntsville
And free board
when you get there.
Pretty soft.
My friends!
My friends!
R.C. Crawford
is the name.
You have probably
heard of me.
Now, because
of my interest
in the public welfare,
I have been framed
by some crooked
politicians,
But I will prove
my innocence!
Are you giving back
all that graft money?
That money
that you refer to is a myth.
You gonna make
campaign speeches
all the way?
Will none of you
good people
Cry out against
the injustice done
to an honest man?
Sure...
But where do we find
the honest man, huh?
Standing before you,
my friends.
Standing before you.
Careful, R.C.
First thing you know,
you'll have
these people cryin'.
Man's inhumanity to man.
Mike?
Laura Manon,
Mike Reno.
Help her up
into the wagon.
Hey, it ain't right
that you take her with you.
Yeah? What do you
know about it?
You know what she done?
She ain't gonna travel
with that swine.
She ain't
no common criminal.
The man
she killed deserved it.
The man she killed
happened to be
my friend.
I'll tell you
something else.
She's worse than
a common criminal.
She's a...
You see, Mr. Reno,
that's what I am.
Trouble.
It happens
wherever I go.
You ain't no trouble
to us, ma'am.
Don't bet on it.
I want you
to meet Miss Manon.
Miss Laura Manon.
I might enjoy
this trip after all.
Miss Manon,
may I offer you
my seat?
Allow me to
introduce myself.
- My name...
- Is the great
R.C. Crawford.
- This is Hank Pleasant,
child murderer.
- That's a lie.
It was an accident.
I didn't see him so good.
Senorita, the name
is Angel Domingue.
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Dominguez.
Hyah!
Why didn't you tell me
we were picking up
a female?
Nobody told me.
Did you ever
have to deliver
a woman prisoner before?
Not a pretty one.
I don't like the idea.
I think you do.
That worries me some.
If you ask me,
this wagon ain't gonna
hold up all the way.
If it does break,
what then?
Wouldn't surprise me none
if he made us walk.
I'm quite certain
that regulations state
That we must be
duly transported.
Man as important
as R.C. Crawford,
They'll transport you
if they have to
carry you piggy back.
You know, amigo. When I break
my leg, my cousin carry me
piggy back for 10 miles.
Miss Manon,
I'd like to be friendly.
I know who you are,
Miss Manon.
All right, and she
knows who you are.
That makes you even.
I read of your case.
I'm sure many people
have read of my "case."
I was formerly
state railroad commissioner.
Pity you couldn't
have arranged for us
To have a train
to take us to Huntsville.
Since we're all going
to be quite close
for the next few days,
I thought perhaps
you'd like to know
Something more about
your fellow passengers.
You see, I, uh...
I knew
Bradley Weddington
very well.
I had several deals
with him.
I'm sorry, Miss Manon.
I know how you feel,
but I could tell you
some things about him.
Please don't.
Bradley Weddington.
Didn't he get himself killed?
Listen, I'm quite certain
that he deserved it.
However, I honor
his taste in the opposite sex.
Yeah, sure.
Lady friend done him in.
Dance hall entertainer.
Got three years.
Ah, you keep quiet,
Pleasant.
Where's your tact?
Don't say that to me.
You know, amigo,
I'm only from a
little pueblo,
But I know what you mean.
So she's the one
who killed Weddington, huh?
Good for you, Duchess.
I like a woman
with gumption.
I'm not sure that it took
gumption, Miss Manon.
You see, I've known
about Weddington for years.
Oh, socially
prominent family,
Important influence
in Washington,
Rich, charming,
pillar of society,
philanthropist,
And the biggest
double-crosser
in the world.
Oh, I don't mind
the hypocrites
As long as they don't
hurt other people,
but he did.
Yeah, I remember
once I hired out
to help bust up a press,
Burn down a newspaper office.
I heard that Weddington
paid for the job.
The newspaper probably
printed something
he didn't like.
Could've been
killed Weddington.
You had to take the blame
for killing a slob like him.
I know how you feel.
How would you know?
You've been killing
since you were 15.
Yeah, but this time
I was railroaded.
How did I know
it was a kid?
It was dark.
I thought he was
coming after me.
I think if any of us
was railroaded,
it was Miss Manon.
Yeah. Me and her both.
And the jurors' wives
belonged to
the purity league.
If they'd brought back
a verdict of not guilty,
Their old ladies
would've locked 'em out.
I think I can hear them
hatchet-faced biddies
yelling at her.
Ah, it's an old story
in the west.
A man steps
a little too hard
On somebody's toes or neck.
A bullet fixes that,
and then they find
somebody convenient...
In this case,
Miss Manon...
To throw to the lions.
Chihuahua.
It don't seem right,
you know?
I was sent
to the calaboose
for stealing goats.
That I do not mind,
For I want to be a cook
like my uncle,
But a beautiful lady
killing her man
in a quarrel of love?
This is the way of life?
This is the way lovers act?
Angel...
I feel exactly
as you do,
But I'm afraid
you've missed the point.
Si?
How about telling us
what really happened,
Duchess?
Can't we talk about
something else?
Sorry. It sometimes
helps to talk.
He ought to know.
That's all he ever does...
talk, talk, talk.
Senorita, I will
do something
better for you.
I will sing you
a song so sad
That you will feel happy.
Thank you, Angel.
I'd love to hear one.
Si, senorita.
* Carmen, Carmela
* Luz de mis ojos
* Ay
Si, amigo.
Yeah, this is the place.
Got about another hour.
Yeah, we'll make camp
the other side
of that hill.
Would you like
a drink, ma'am?
No, thank you,
Mr. Reno.
Real thoughtful
when it comes to
a pretty gal, ain't you?
He's only being
a gentleman, senor.
You heroes
and your tin stars,
all alike.
Either pushing
somebody around
Or makin' a play
for a poor gal
who can't help herself.
How can you
say that, amigo?
He only...
For the last time,
goat thief,
don't talk to me.
MCCOOL: Pleasant!
Pleasant, you're
not only a coward,
you're a dirty liar.
Pleasant!
I warned you
about laying hands
on the prisoner.
What did I tell ya?
Gangin' up on me.
McCool, as a personal
favor, let big mouth
out of that wagon.
I've got a feeling he'd rather
have you let the lady prisoner
out of the wagon, Marshal.
I'll let out
some of your blood.
Mike.
Now I'm gonna have to
warn you about laying hands
on the prisoner.
Besides, you've
already taken him once.
Yeah, and I ain't about
to forget that.
I told you
I'd cause trouble.
He isn't trouble.
He's just hot air.
It'll all be over
When they take that
little rope and put it
around your neck.
And hang you.
See what I mean?
You give 'em a badge,
they ain't human.
Anyone ever
call you human?
You button your lip
or I'll fatten it for you.
McCool,
he's beggin' for it.
Mike, you just...
You just simmer down.
Remember, we're supposed
to deliver him in one piece.
This is gonna make
a turkey shoot look easy.
Yep.
One thing R.C. Crawford
will never be
out of is cigars.
One thing R.C. Crawford
will never be out of is bull.
My friends will see
that I'm supplied until
the day I prove my innocence.
You're guilty as hell,
and you know it.
There'll be appeals.
Whoa.
Do you know
where that road
could wash out?
There's a wash
about three miles ahead.
Sure like to
take a look at it.
There was a cloudburst
around here a week past.
Must be it.
Funny lookin' tracks.
Indian sled,
maybe carretas.
You, uh...
You know where
that detour goes?
Well, it must go
through that canyon.
Well, what do you think?
I think we're acting
like a couple of old hens
with one chick.
Let's go.
Hey, Aaron.
I see something.
Yeah, it's them.
- Say, McCool,
you notice that...
- Yeah, I know.
Something happened
to the sleigh tracks.
Maybe the, uh,
Indians camped off the trail.
Maybe that's what
they want us to think.
Could be
it wasn't Indians.
You're sayin'
every now and then
on these trips someone...
Tries to
set up a bushwhack?
Yeah, every now and then.
I better take
a little look around.
Better stay within
hollerin' distance.
Sorry, lady and gents.
There'll be
a slight delay
While the brakeman
inspects the roadbed.
I resent that allusion
to a railroad.
I'm sorry, Commissioner.
Do we have to keep
these shackles on?
Right now,
I'm afraid so.
Well,
I'm sure
you know best.
Why don't you
try to butter the man up,
Duchess?
Couldn't be nicer.
He seed me
at the last minute.
You plugged him
somewhere for sure.
I ain't so all
sure about that.
Hyah!
Pretty smart
for a lawman.
I want to get him
in the belly.
You can still take him,
cousin.
You know what that is?
Relatives of mine.
We'll be
leavin' here soon.
Some of us, anyway.
You're going with me,
Duchess.
I'll make you forget
that fancy Dan you killed.
He ain't got
no fair shot at us,
not where he is.
We got him
pinned down good.
Let's finish him off
before the other one
gets here.
Get around him.
Did you break
a bone?
No, but it sure
tore things up.
We'll never
make it, Ned.
Not now.
I sure hate
to leave old Hank.
We'll get over to Dos Rios.
Some of the family
are there.
We can still head off
that wagon a day
out of Huntsville.
Give me a hand.
Mike!
Over here!
Looks like there were
two of them.
I hit one.
You don't look any too much
the worse for wear.
A few bumps and scratches
where my horse pulled me.
Who do you suppose
they were?
They were probably friends
of Pleasant.
Crawford's pretty sure
about his connections.
Don't overlook
Miss Manon.
She probably has friends
who'd give their eye teeth
to deliver her.
I can't say
I blame them.
You on her side?
It just doesn't seem right
that she should do time
For killin' some
pigheaded crook.
You've been listening
to Crawford.
The things he said
about this Weddington
or whatever his name was,
You know,
the guy she killed.
Yeah...
It could be
that Crawford was lying,
didn't even know him.
What you're saying is
that the law's perfect.
She's guilty
and should be put away.
Well, now, not exactly.
You're saying that
she shouldn't be.
I'm not saying anything.
I can think what I want to.
No more shoots.
Maybe no more bullets.
Maybe they're both dead.
Oh, no, senor.
Here they come.
The other men
must be dead.
Well, I ain't dead.
I'm making
my own break.
Crawford, for a price,
I'll take you along.
No charge for you,
Duchess.
Dominguez,
I'll let bygones
be bygones.
You go, too.
Just keep your mouth shut.
This goes
for all of you.
We might just
as well settle here
for the night.
That shot
got any closer,
Might've settled
here forever.
Well, you'll be able
to relax now.
We'll make camp here.
- Senor McCool!
- Look out!
Uh!
No, I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction of a bullet.
Angel, Miss Manon,
I could almost
forgive you two for that.
I'm sorry
for your sake, senor.
Well done, McCool.
I had a little help.
Might as well
build a fire.
*
Hey, Angel.
Thanks for taking off
the shackles.
I don't think
you'd be going anywhere.
Wouldn't get far
if I tried.
Not in this country.
Your friend
seems to be enjoying
the rest of the weary.
He'll need it.
He takes
the next watch.
He's very nice.
He said the same for you.
He's quite young, isn't he?
Makes him susceptible
to female charms.
But you aren't?
At one time.
I know.
If only things
had been different.
Yeah. Same old story.
Oldest story
in the world.
If only.
Yep.
My if only's different.
It goes something like this.
If only she hadn't
been what she was.
Did it really matter?
Well, that's what
I found out later...
That it really
didn't matter.
But I suppose
your hurt pride
drove her away, hmm?
Oh, if only you hadn't
said the things to her
that you did say.
I said them.
Did you look for her?
When something
like that happens, you...
You stop looking.
You might have met
someone, uh, better.
I might have,
but I didn't.
You hurt pretty bad.
In one way or another.
Look, Miss Manon,
If you're thinking, uh,
about getting around me,
it won't work.
All right, let's
get 'em rolling.
You got these irons on
too tight.
You're breaking my heart.
- Mornin'.
- Good morning.
Sleep good?
Yes. Very well,
thank you.
Right here.
Didn't ask me
how I slept.
With a headache,
I assume.
Somehow I don't
think he cares.
True, senor, true.
You, Dominguez,
I am going to kill.
Sure. Same way
you killed the constable.
Always he try
to kill somebody.
You're a smart girl,
playing up to the deputy.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You, uh, worried
about those bushwhackers
that hit us yesterday?
Some.
I know somebody
you worried.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Marshal Willett
back at San Carlos.
He said I was
making a mistake
in hiring you.
What made him think so?
Said he was
a good judge
of character.
For some reason or
other, had you pegged
as bad medicine.
Even bet me cash
that you'd get me
into trouble.
I covered that bet.
Said I was as good
a judge of character
as he was.
* Carmen, Carmela
* Luz de mis ojos
We're getting closer.
We'll be in Huntsville
by tomorrow night.
Not if my kin
got anything to say
about it.
The warden will realize
who R.C. Crawford is.
Sure.
Probably turn
the whole place
over to you.
I hope the trip
hasn't been too much
for you, ma'am.
No worse
than I expected.
Well, it should
be over tomorrow.
Yes,
I guess it will.
That should make you
real happy, Mike.
Hmm?
Oh, uh, I haven't
minded it too much.
Wonder what jail's
going to be like.
Well, it won't be
much like a saloon.
No, I suppose not.
No noise. No laughter.
MCCOOL: No broken-down
piano playing
sad songs.
That's right.
Good night, gentlemen.
Night.
What are you trying
to do to her?
Maybe say goodbye.
How come you
hate her so much?
Reminds me of someone.
In about three minutes,
for me it'll be
about four hours later.
Yes, sir, I'd sure
like to see Willett's face
when he pays off.
Don't ever come
sneaking up like that.
Sorry. I...
I couldn't sleep.
You might've got
yourself shot at.
May I sit down?
I don't know why
he lets you
wander around free,
Even if you couldn't
get too far
in this country.
I almost wish
you had shot me.
Don't say that.
It might be better.
How do you think
I'd feel about it?
I mean...
I mean, about
killing a woman.
A no-good woman?
I heard different.
What you heard
was that I killed
a no-good man.
Why don't you
go back to where
you were sleeping?
I'm not sleepy.
Well, you can't stay
around here.
You afraid I might
take that gun
away from you?
No, of course not.
Then why can't I stay?
All right, stay.
We could talk a little.
Go ahead, talk.
Certainly does get
lonesome out here.
Yeah, it sure does.
Mind if I call you Mike?
You just did.
You call me Laura.
Laura.
Mike, I've noticed
the way you
look at me sometimes.
I look at everybody.
In that same way?
Yeah. I stare.
Look,
let's talk about
something else, huh?
I always look back,
don't I?
I, uh...
I didn't notice.
Why don't
you notice, now?
You're not going to jail.
You don't deserve that.
Three years
won't be too long.
Three years?
That's like 300.
The time will pass, and...
Someday, maybe...
You're not gonna
do any time.
I'm gonna see to that.
Mike, Mike,
that's not possible.
I'm gonna
make it possible now,
while they're asleep.
I'm coming along.
Oh, no.
That'll be dangerous
for you.
Besides, how?
I'll... I'll break
the firing pin
in McCool's gun.
You can take my horse.
I'll take one of the mules.
You'll be a wanted man.
It doesn't matter.
MCCOOL: It matters to me.
Looks like Willett
collects his bet.
You're not gonna
stop me or her.
I think I am.
Things haven't
changed a bit,
have they?
Same Laura.
You haven't changed
either, Gid.
Time has.
You knew her before?
Yeah.
Once.
It's not the way
it looks.
It never is.
You've got
to believe me this time.
Why?
Ask him.
Nothing has changed.
The same game.
Why didn't you say
something about it?
We decided back
in the jail that it'd be
better not to.
Gid, Mike and I just...
I just wanted to be
free. I don't want
to go to jail.
Surely you can
understand that.
I shot Weddington
in self-defense.
He was going to kill me.
That's what
you told the jury.
I shouldn't have
to serve time.
I agree.
The judge
thought different.
Look, I don't care
when you knew her or
why or how. That's past.
Now I say she isn't gonna
do time in some prison.
My orders read,
"Deliver the prisoners."
I'd better take
that gun belt.
Now.
They will
kill each other.
If they don't,
I will.
They're fighting
like a couple
of animals.
The winner gets
the girl.
They don't know it yet,
but I'm gonna be
the winner.
They do not see
Senor Pleasant.
Good. Maybe
he'll kill them both,
Then we'll get away,
the four of us.
But... But you
are innocent.
There were appeals
for you.
There are no appeals.
I'm not innocent.
But senor, you told us
that you were innocent,
and you're guilty?
You're not the first
to let a woman make
a fool out of you.
This isn't gonna
change anything.
You're gonna make
the rest of the trip
in shackles.
Let go of him.
Get up there.
Don't make me shoot.
You go right ahead.
I know you think
you're still right.
You get the chance,
you'd probably
try it again.
Well, you're not
gonna be getting
a chance.
You think
she likes you.
She was just conning you.
McCool, here's your rifle.
You should've used it.
You knew I wouldn't.
You killed one man.
If you'd have used it,
You two could've
been out of here
by now.
Why don't you
leave me alone, Marshal?
Get your bracelets on,
Honey.
All right, you,
get over here.
Can I make breakfast,
Senor McCool?
There'll be no time
for breakfast.
We're too late now.
All right,
let's get aboard.
I'm sorry, Angel.
Sorry I didn't thank you
for yesterday.
Well, thank you
for thanking me,
senor.
You know, I was thinking,
when we get to the prison,
I'll talk to the warden
about you.
Senor Constable,
If you can only
get me a job
in the prison kitchen.
That's not exactly what
I was thinking about.
I was thinking
maybe the warden would...
Would write to the governor
and they'd get you
a pardon.
That would mean
they would not let me
stay in prison?
That's right.
You'd be able to get out.
Oh, no, senor,
that's no good,
Not until I learn
to cook.
It would be no good
if I could not cook
So I can get a job
in the big city.
We'll see, Angel.
Pleasant!
One thing I'll say
for you, you sure never
give up trying.
Now get in
the wagon.
See, Mike,
I am trouble.
I'm not complaining.
Thanks for trying.
It ain't over yet.
We'll be in Huntsville
tonight.
We still got
a few miles to go.
If your kin
do liberate us,
Are you still going
to take me with you?
But Senor Crawford
told me he was guilty.
R.C. Crawford guilty?
A crook? No.
I'm a desperate man,
Mr. Pleasant.
Mr. Pleasant.
Don't make me beg.
They liberate us,
I'm going to put you
out of your misery.
A bullet right through
your big fat mouth.
Bunco, I'm right glad
that you and Alfie agreed
to come along with us.
Shucks, Aaron,
Me and Alfie's
been beholden
to Hank Pleasant
For more years
than we can remember.
Aaron, ain't you
forgetting about old Tub
throwing in with us?
I was just waitin' to see
if he could hold out.
Don't worry about him.
He may not be
the man that Chig is,
but he'll hold up.
I know he will.
I was just joshin'.
The main road's
over yonder.
I'll go on up ahead.
The rest of you stay quiet.
And don't run your horses
until I give the signal.
Senor McCool,
a man up there!
A man up there!
- Yeah? Where?
- Right up there!
He is looking at us.
And he had a rifle.
The crazy goat
thief's lyin'.
I swear it, senor.
A man on a horse!
PLEASANT: He's trying
to spook you, McCool.
Ain't nobody
out there, McCool.
They'll kill us!
They'll kill us all,
except him.
They're all
right down there.
This should be easy
as hot pie.
I didn't see the one
on horseback, though.
He's more than likely
resting up in the wagon.
I like hot pie
the easy way.
That's why
we're all here.
We got him six to two.
They gotta take
the chances, not us.
Come on, fellas.
Just take care of yourselves
and keep plucking.
Let's go.
If the wagon is attacked,
you'll help Gid,
won't you?
Why?
You can't let him
fight alone.
Why can't I?
Call to him.
Tell him you'll help him.
Not a chance.
Listen, kid,
and listen fast.
He was right.
I was conning you.
I'd have done
anything to escape.
You could've shot him
and you didn't.
You know why,
don't you?
He does.
I'm in love with him.
Always have been.
That's why he
turned his back
on the rifle.
He knew
I wouldn't shoot.
Mike, this might be
the last chance
You'll ever have
to grow up.
Are you gonna let us
just sit here
and get shot at?
Nobody is shooting
at you.
I told ya.
I told ya
they'd come.
I hope you're satisfied.
You have a nice
front-row seat.
You can watch him
get killed!
McCool!
That marshal at San Carlos,
he don't have to win that bet.
I was a chump, okay?
I admit it.
But you're being a chump, too,
if you don't let me help you.
We can take 'em.
Mike.
It'll take more
than you and McCool
to stop 'em.
I got one of 'em.
Well,
that makes two.
They've flanked us.
Mike!
They busted
Tubby's leg.
I saw Bunco go down.
- The kid heard you.
- I forgot Bunco's
his pa.
You and your big mouth.
That's Chig over there
covering us.
Let's move in
on that wagon.
Old Chig's gonna
set this up for us.
That's crazy.
Chig's over there.
Sure came
from where he was.
Hank! We're coming!
We'll get you,
Hank!
Aaron, get back here
behind the rock.
They ain't gonna
get to hang you, Hank.
Ain't nobody
gonna hang you.
Stay back, Aaron,
stay back!
Drop that gun.
Aaron!
Uhh.
Hank.
That was my brother!
He come to get me!
He try, senor.
God knows he try.
What made you
change your mind?
She told me
she was in love with you.
And she said
she always had been.
He knows it.
He's known it all along.
You took a long time
in telling me.
Gid, once this trip is over...
It isn't likely
I'll be seeing you again.
My regular run
is Huntsville.
We'll visit.
We'll have a lot
of time to talk.
Mike, let's get
on the road.
