Take it easy, we're comin'.
Shake it up, we gotta go.
What do you think I'm doin'? I'm pushin'
his boot and he won't even help.
# Whiskey river... don't run dry...
- All right, here.
- Thanks.
Hey, how about a little coffee?
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.
Got a little somethin' to go with that?
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.
Button his shirt, put his arm
in the sleeve and get the wire.
- His hat. Where's his hat?
- I'm buttoning his shirt.
Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.
Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.
I'm all right. Let me go.
- Is he gonna make it?
- Sure. Don't he always?
No.
.
...
...
...
...
.
.
...
....
.
Oh, Wendell.
- Wendell...
- Shut up.
Oh, shit.
For all you hard-playin' little folks
whose bodies are growin' every day...
...you remember
that Ranch Breakfast... uh...
...is the cereal that builds champions.
It's explodin' with a kind of energy
that's... that's got more stuff in it, uh...
...than toast, and bacon...
- Eggs.
- Eggs...
And toast, and bacon, and, uh...
...meat loaf, and olives...
...nuts...
It's just got more good stuff in it...
Just so much good stuff...
.
...
Hey, Sonny? Sonny? Sonny?!
Hey, it's Lucinda. Lucinda.
Lucinda Fairlee. You...
The JB Ranch trick cowgirl rider.
OK, up we go. Hello, how you doin'?
You don't remember me?
Last month, after the Watsonville Rodeo?
Mommy!
I know how you feel.
...
....
...
...
...
......
....
Well, I won my rent
on that sucker many a time.
- Horse should be standin' stud.
- We all should.
That's the beauty
you're ridin' in Vegas Friday.
He ain't gonna ride him.
Just sit on him up on the stage...
...and he's gonna have
little rubber booties on his hooves.
Leroy, you wanna sign this?
It's for that Watkins kid.
He drawed ol' Little Venus over
in Fairview. Let's send him some luck.
I don't think he's gonna need it.
- You stayed on worse than Little Venus.
- Ain't no worse than Little Venus.
The hell there ain't. Nameless was worse,
and he did eight on Nameless.
Well, I ain't on Nameless any more.
And I got no intention of bein'.
That was a little compliment there.
Here's a ranch for sale in Baily. 450 acres.
You shoulda got that place at Spanish
Fork instead of that Malibu house.
Oh, Spanish... What's the matter
with the Malibu house?
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb,
actin' like a damn penguin.
What's the matter with you pickers?
You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.
You got room service, you're flyin' around
first class, you got limousines...
...ladies in the lobby,
the laundry has tissue paper in it...
You're livin' like a bunch of fat oil barons!
Livin'... better than we got a right to.
- Cowboys in the ocean makes no sense.
- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.
And it beats havin' a bull
use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?
Ah...
# Momma...
# Don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys
# Don't let 'em pick guitars
and drive them old trucks
# Make 'em be doctors
and lawyers and such
# Momma, don't let your babies
grow up to be cowboys
# They'll never stay home,
they're always alone
# Even with someone they love
We'd have been here sooner,
but we ran into these, uh, javelinas...
- Can I have a coffee?
- Just a minute...
- There's no rush.
- There ain't?
Come on. I wanna show you something.
...
...
...
...
....
Well, what in the hell...?!
- That's not me.
- They don't know the difference.
What's your name?
How come you're so cute?
- What time's the press conference?
- Uh, got half an hour.
Here you are, Hallie.
Now, if there's anything you need,
just say the word.
We got about half a dozen
movie people here...
...Bud Broderick,
Joanna Camden just came in...
...Rising Star is here...
- What are you gonna do with the horse?
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele,
the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.
You think he's worth coverin'?
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...
...but there's just a lot of "yup"
and "shucks", and stuff like that.
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.
See you downstairs.
Bernie... So, they don't want us
to talk to the cowboy.
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!
Excuse me, please.
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.
Excuse me, could you tell me
if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?
No, he's not listed.
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.
- May I see it?
- Sure.
Oh, it's lovely.
Why does Ampco say absolutely
no interviews with Sonny Steele?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.
That don't really
mean anything, you know.
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes
he loses the best part of himself.
What is the best part of himself?
- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have  known him?
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay,
so just behave yourself.
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.
Foggy Tate's wife Louise
gave me this handkerchief.
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!
Come on. This is a serious thing to these
people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.
So don't tell no jokes,
don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.
John, you had a question.
Do you anticipate opposition
to the takeover of Omnibank?
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.
We've made a generous tender offer
for the Omnibank shares.
We're confident they'll accept it.
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump
outta that seat. You have a question?
For Mr Broderick.
Bud, you've played opposite just about
every great motion-picture actress.
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?
That depends. What part of the body
are you talking about?
Print that. I dare you.
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late
to the press conference?
Ha... Well...
I'd like to apologise for that.
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.
And we lost her, too.
Do you in fact
eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?
Well, ma'am, I eat
steak and eggs for breakfast.
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.
You were three-time
Worid Champion Cowboy...
Five.
Five-times Worid Champion Cowboy,
and now you're selling cereal.
How do you feel about that?
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.
You are all invited
by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?
After you circle, you stop
on your mark, stage left...
...lean forward in the saddle,
face the audience, wave...
Where's the horse?
Bring in the damn horse.
Spot, please.
God, he's a beauty.
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times,
applause, applause, applause...
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.
This tendon, it ought
to be braced and bandaged.
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.
How else are we gonna get him up here
with all these lights?
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!
Sonny, your first line...
"Ranch Breakfast...
a champ's way to start the morning."
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"
"If you agree, don't say anything."
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.
"Ranch Breakfast,
a champ's way to start the morning."
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.
Much bigger. Louder.
"Ranch Bre..."
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.
This it here?
You ain't in no shape
to see no Hunt Sears.
What I gotta do first? Jog?
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed
drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...
Each item will appear in several major
magazines during the month of July.
As an example of our confidence
in the success of these new fashions...
...Ampco will be sending these lovely
models on a one-month tour...
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.
Hey. How are you?
Well, then let's...
Carol's interested in commercials...
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.
Get him a short horse.
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?
That question about the merger -
who the hell was that guy?
That was Cross, the Washington bureau
of the . He's connected to Treasury.
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.
Sonny, here's a couple I'd
like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.
Sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year.
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.
He sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it
with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.
Why not just take a picture of Grace in
front of that picture of me and the box...
...with a picture of me on the box,
holding a picture of me...
Then you got Grace
and a whole bunch of pictures of me.
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.
I bet it's shorter.
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?
Hello, Sonny. It's about time
we finally met, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.
But he don't belong
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most
natural place in the worid for any of us.
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.
Let's give him a drink!
Rising Star represents
a substantial investment.
You can be sure
we've entrusted his care to experts.
Well, I don't think
them experts are so expert.
Mr Steele, would you please sign this
picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.
Look, why don't I make an appointment
with Mr Sears's secretary...
Why would you put that horse
on a stage with dancing girls?
- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to .
It sells products, Sonny.
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.
All them lights blinkin' and winkin',
and girls...
Sir, I used to rodeo.
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.
To who?
This is a conversation
we might have some other time.
Would it matter?
What matters is that you fulfil
the requirements of your contract.
Which don't include your passing
judgment on corporate policy.
Nothin' in that contract
about me ridin' toy horses.
You're not in rodeo any more.
Actually, you're more famous now,
aren't you?
Your face is on millions of boxes,
on billboards all over the country...
...people want your autograph...
What I'm talking about
is that you voluntarily accepted...
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...
...that more than a handful of cowboys
would give their right arm for.
You're right.
I don't want just to be right.
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden
is waiting over by the earthmover.
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.
You bet.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.
Wendell handles all that, babe,
you know that. Come talk to me.
How  old Wendell
who can't find a stamp?
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels,
please. Tall glass.
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.
All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson .
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.
I want you to sign these papers.
You don't think I saw you tryin'
to slip out? I left three messages.
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.
Sonny, that judge told you
to sign the papers.
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?
Excuses?
You got somebody now who sits up
all night cos you lost your keys?
Or you got a flat tyre?
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me
to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look
like they hadn't been in your back seat!
Charlotta, yoo-hoo,
you got a mean memory.
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!
That light-up suit
musta given you shock treatment!
I'm talkin' a  of parties,
and a  of back seats!
But for back seats, we'd never have met.
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.
You're just walkin' around
to save funeral expenses.
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.
Do you know what your skeleton looks like
in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.
You couldn't get through
a metal detector stark naked.
Give me the papers.
Huh?
Give me the papers.
- For real?
- Give me them.
You look like hell.
Well, you look great.
Hey. Would you come up to my room?
I can't. You just know what'd happen.
Yeah.
Besides, I got somebody
who really likes me now.
Well, it's not hard to do.
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.
Billy-Roy Fix?
Is that right?
I guess there's just somethin'
about us Western stars.
- ...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.
Goodbye, darlin'.
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?
Well, Mr Steele.
After this number,
the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.
And then you and the horse.
Now, listen. You don't start those things
until I give you the cue, yes?
Not now.
Not now! Not now!
Open the curtain.
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...
...but it's too dangerous
to use that horse on a ramp.
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!
He wasn't even supposed to be out there
yet! He's ruined the whole concept!
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.
Well, he was askin' about
the horse's tendon, and the drugs.
Drugs? What drugs?
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.
They tranquillise the animal
to keep it calm.
And the Butazolidin
they use for the... tendon.
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed
we've used steroids to muscle him up.
Well, are they dangerous?
Well, they make the horse sterile.
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just
a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the worid of illusion.
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.
Jesus...
We're not talking about a horse,
we're talking about a $300 million merger.
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.
If Steele talks to anyone before
he's caught, we have no merger.
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.
If we've mismanaged the horse,
we've mismanaged the corporation.
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.
And get those morons out of here.
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!
We have been advised
by the attorney general...
...that the theft of Rising Star
is grand larceny, a felony.
Should this prove to be a deliberate act,
a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.
At this time, however, our primary concern
is the welfare of our horse.
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?
- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not  crazy.
He's been tossed on his head enough
times. Thought about brain damage?
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake
and he'll bring it back when he cools out?
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?
I don't know any answers.
I don't know from brain damage,
from cooling out...
Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some  news, for chrissake!
"Cool... out."
....
-
-
.
...
...
.
...
...
.
.
Seen Wendell?
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just
runnin' round like crazy people today.
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin'
personal. Were you surprised he did it?
Who, Sonny?
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some
surprises are bigger than others.
Like he gave me this ring one day,
just like that.
Had old Wendell's teeth
fixed for him, too.
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about
the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean
is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.
Mesquite.
You wanna drive?
Morning.
Hello.
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?
Oh, five or six dozen.
- Bags?
- Boxes.
Come on, boy. Come on, son.
Just a couple more times of doin' this
and you'll be breathin' just fine.
If  live.
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills
# Round her head
# Glimmer golden hills
Mr Atwater?
You wounded?
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.
- But he was.
- Yep.
From about this high.
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.
Like a flutterin' bird.
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.
They told me you'd know
where to find him.
How else would I know
where you were? Huh?
We're real worried about him.
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.
I can't hurt him.
He came here. Covered with a mist.
You know? Like floats atop a river?
And... and it grows into a cloud...
...and it shuts away the sun...
Where'd he go, Gus?
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.
How? How did you find me?
Gus.
Gus Atwater.
Gus?
Gus.
Can I... can I get up now?
Please?
How did you know to get to Gus?
I... interviewed your friends.
Who?
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...
Wait a minute, you hit my face,
you son of bitch!
I'm not gonna stay here.
What did you take the horse for?
You're crazy.
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...
Oh,  crazy? You go off with somebody
else's $12 million horse, and  crazy?!
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.
Does anybody else know you're here?
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have
any reason to tell anybody anything.
Go away. Go home.
Well, what  you gonna do with him?
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.
And you're not gonna start
your own cereal company.
I mean, what the hell  you want?
Oh, can't you just answer one question?
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...
What do you expect,
sneakin' up like some cat?
I tried to call, but your line was busy.
Do you know how worried your friends are
about you? Wendell and Leroy?
Isn't there something I can tell them?
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?
You want information, go to the library.
I know what you want. It ain't answers.
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?
Honest to hell, you people
are all the same.
There's folks in Africa,
or some damn place...
...you try to take a picture of them,
they'll kill ya.
They figure you're takin' somethin' from
them, and you just got so much stuff...
...and if other people take it all
you got nothin' left.
Well, I don't wanna be no story.
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip
with somebody else's $12 million horse.
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.
But not yours.
I'm nobody's story but my own now.
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?
Look, can't you just do
a working girl a favour?
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck,
tell an honest tale.
I don't want to make up
a story about you.
Anyway, what have you got to lose?
Everybody's wondering where you're going,
why you did it.
The great American cowboy
and the worid-champion horse...
...riding into the sunset...
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!
Come on, son. Come on, boy.
If you think you're gettin' away from me
you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me
what you're gonna do with the horse.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Now it shouldn't take you more
than about 15 minutes to change that.
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call
the cops. I got your license plate.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.
It was from this hotel that Rising Star,
greatest money-winner in racing history...
...and corporate symbol for one
of the worid's largest conglomerates...
...was taken late Friday night.
Yesterday I uncovered information
which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.
.
.
You got any shoelaces?
- What?
- Shoelaces?
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.
...
...
.
- What?
- What?
- .
- What?!
...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Where was he?
- I forgot.
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could
put you right in the middle of the story.
We could guarantee
that you get first crack at everything.
I've already had first crack at everything.
Suppose we made it exclusive?
How about if we gave you
exclusive footage on the capture?
Oh, when are you planning that?
Wanna tell me about that confrontation
with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.
Aiding a felon during the commission of
a felonious act, concealment of a felony...
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take
on the First Amendment, be my guest.
That oughta sell
a whole lot of breakfast cereal.
I'll be around,
if you wanna handcuff me later.
- We  take her to court.
- Have her locked up.
And gain what? The last thing
we need is a female martyr.
At least he didn't say anything
about mistreating the horse.
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.
You "think". It's a chance
we can't afford to take.
Do we have a choice?
We could make sure that if he speaks
to anyone he won't be believed.
Can you get to the media
by the 11 o'clock news?
How the hell did she find him,
we ain't even heard from him?
We sent her over there,
that's how she found him.
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried
to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...
She liked your ring, she liked
my watch, I liked her eyes...
That's how those people are. They tell
you they're your friend, and they use you.
Well, what are we gonna do?
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...
...one of those keno girls that can suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.
...
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep
standin', boy, we'd have this licked.
...
...
.
.
.
...
...
.
.
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.
- He isn't hurt?
- No.
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?
Just wonderin'.
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long
time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.
What  the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?
All's I know is he musta had a good
reason, or he woulda been back by now.
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!
You know, they only said
those bad things about him.
They didn't say what's decent. Even
though it is hard to find it sometimes.
How'd you meet Sonny?
Hallie Martin, please.
- What?
-
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.
It's time for another
wide-rangin' conversation.
-
- Is it you?
Right from the dim glow
of the shrouded campfire.
I broke three nails changing that tyre.
- You want a story?
- Yes.
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.
So if he stopped for the night he should
be within 150 miles of St George.
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate
on Liberty and Cedarville.
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't
prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.
Just don't let him start up
about the horse.
I'm here!
Hey, I'm here!
I'm alone. No troops.
Come on. Come on.
Oh... Oh, God!
I think I've broken my leg.
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Here. Get your camera ready.
Uh...
Listen, would you mind standing
over here with that background?
No, this is all right. Right here.
But I think it'd be more dramatic
in front of...
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.
Listen, I've been driving all night,
and I'm not used to being talked to like...
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.
What do  call
a man who steals horses?
Have you ever seen this horse race?
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back,
and lose his stride, and pick himself up.
I saw him stretch out
when he had  left to give...
...but he found it... somewhere.
And he won.
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.
He's got more heart, and more drive,
and more... soul...
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.
Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!
They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers
and bute, stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up,
he's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on
some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.
To say nothin' of what
the horse hisself is missin'.
So...
...so I took him.
Come on, let's go. Get this...
Let's crank up this little hummer
and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.
All right?
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.
And he's one of the best.
He's one of the greatest animals
in the... in the history of... animals.
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.
I gotta tend this horse
and get him movin'.
Listen, can I... can I come with you?
No!
Why? I wouldn't be any...
- Trouble?
- No.
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?
Card. Sometimes you think of something
you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.
Steele, what  you gonna do with him?
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.
Enough.
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.
From doing what?
I'm gonna turn him loose.
What?! Rising Star?
I'm gonna get him back
to where he was, what he was.
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna
have his own shot at it, that's all.
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?
- I know.
- Who else knows?
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?
You know you're gonna
screw up your whole life?
Goddamnit, I'm trying to  it, lady!
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.
- Is it true?
- Nope.
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?
Don't tell me.
She says you take her breath away.
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.
She's, uh, she's pretty.
Yes, she is pretty.
She said that when you two
first met you... Oh...
Wait, that canyon
where you went on your honeymoon...
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.
Goddamn that woman!
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.
That's exactly why I left her,
her and her big m... Or she left me.
Anyway, I'm not goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon.
I have an idea. Let's go into town,
have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.
My treat.
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin'
a mailbox, so if you'd be...
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.
Well...
What do I do? Just take this road
back to the broken tree?
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.
...
Les, I am trying to convey a sense
of urgency. I want this on the air today.
.
.
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.
I need a camera crew to meet me at a
place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.
- Try the Automobile Club or something.
-
They should leave right now, cos I don't
know when I'll get there or he'll get there.
And they should be prepared to camp out.
I have a feeling this place
does not have a Hilton Hotel.
I mean, this is a place
like, Les, and...
Les, when Steele gets there,
he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.
$12 million worth of thoroughbred
racehorse, loose in horse heaven.
Think you got a story?
.
- He doesn't want me around.
- .
.
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew
and I'll talk to you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?
I don't know for sure. I think somebody
may have spotted that cereal cowboy.
Hello?
Hi. Listen, are you, uh...
are you going to St George?
'Less they moved the road.
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...
...two motorcycle cops,
a county marshal and a sheriff.
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.
Expert, huh?
Hey.
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?
I am in as much trouble as you are.
If I go back I'll have to tell them
everything I know. And I mean everything.
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't
divulge sources and expect anybody...
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?
I'd have to tell them about Gus.
I would.
Ohh! God!
What are we gonna do?
Get on the floor.
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?
You stay right there. When I go
out the back, you count to 60.
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.
There's a lake there
at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's
gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.
No, wait! You can't...
That's him!
...28, 29, 30...
...58, 59, 60.
He's in Bundy's Field.
- .
- Ten-four.
He's headin' for the dam.
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!
Go! Go!
Come on! Come on! Go!
All the way! Go! Go!
For chrissake, look out!
Oh, jeez!
-
- .
.
Bring him back here.
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.
Put out a reward - a large one.
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, you made it! You made it!
Hey. There's some witch hazel
in the cabinet over the sink...
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.
I owe you one, buddy.
Is he all right?
Easy.
They didn't chase me. You were right.
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.
You were.
Were you surprised that I got here?
No.
It was on the road map. I didn't even
need to ask anybody or anything.
Easy, boy.
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
How long does it take
to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.
What?
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere
for that camper. We'll have to leave it.
- And do what?
- Walk.
.
...
....
- You bet!
.
...
.
.
......
.
...
...
...
.
I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.
And maybe I could find someone that
could take it to the network, like today.
And since you figure it's gonna be
a long trip, that would give us...
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.
That would give us, what,
maybe four or five more days on news.
That way, once you set Rising Star free,
the whole country will be behind you.
Then I'd just have to keep
lookin' back over my shoulder.
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?
No.
Well, how do you think
this is gonna end up?
Not on television.
OK, I, uh... respect your position.
I do. I don't understand it,
but I respect it.
A lot of famous people hated publicity.
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...
Albert Schweitzer... Um...
How you doin', partner?
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.
What are we... doing?
Going to sleep.
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?
Wherever you want.
Where the hell are we,
the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?
I'm ready.
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.
When they spot that camper
they're gonna trace it right to him.
What... what are you doin' with that?
This is expensive equipment,
and I'm responsible for it.
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.
There's no escalators out here,
or bellhops.
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's,
or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell
do you know about New York?
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?
No.
They got a rodeo there, and it's
a damn big thing. And I've been in it.
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.
Did you stay
for the rattlesnake roundup?
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.
They don't have one. How are you
gonna round up a rattlesnake?
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me,
and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that
thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.
Your horse
Ahh... Here, give me
those glasses, would you?
They're prescription.
You wait here with him
till I get back, ya hear?
But if you're spotted
and you don't come back...
Call your lawyer.
Hello. Can I help you?
Howdy. Uh...
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece,
and I wondered if I could use your phone...
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in
a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.
Phone's right there. You help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- .
Sonny!
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...
-
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.
- I'm in the kitchen.
- .
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.
When the people ask about the camper,
tell them "Sonny stole the camper."
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.
Oh, uh...
Partner, I'm much obliged
for the use of that phone.
Here. Five oughta cover it.
Mr Steele...
...I don't want your money.
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.
Right now, it looks like
we oughta get you out of this county.
How do you like it so far?
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?
Doin' all right. Got the whole worid
lookin' for that cowboy.
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway -
except for that reward.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.
All right, you're clear. Come on down.
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.
The woman put together some stuff -
bread and cake and stew and coffee.
I put a bottle in there
to keep your blood pumpin'.
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.
Listen, there's not many people
you'd trust $50,000 worth.
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.
Put his rib through his right lung,
the guy could hardly breathe...
He still got up and rode
the rankest mare there.
I will never understand why you find
that kind of behaviour admirable.
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.
Hey, Steele?
Sonny?
Norman!
How do you know "Norman"?
I never divulge sources.
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?
Try to put your mind on somethin' else,
make things easier.
Get it off your feet.
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?
- What?!
- The national anthem?
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?
I used to be a psychology major.
"America the Beautiful",
that's an easy tune to carry.
Why don't we sit down
and sing it together?
# O spa...
# O beautiful for spacious skies
# With amber waves of grain
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!
# For purple mountains majesty
# Above the fruited plain
# America, America...
Halloween.
Ha...
Hal-louise?
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.
That's not your name.
Alice.
My name is Alice.
My kid sister used
to holler at me after school.
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"
So they called me Hallie.
Alice Martin.
That fits you.
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.
I'll bet you did.
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.
You know what you need?
A pair of proper shoes.
Hey.
Where are we?
Are we lost?
Lost?
No.
Good night... Alice.
Good night, Norman.
If she's with Steele, then the network
will know where they are.
That's the news department, Mr Sears.
I don't think they'll want
to give out that kind of information.
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...
...and we can't get
a simple piece of information?
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.
What are you doin' up?
Nothing much.
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?
Oh, I wish it were that easy.
I don't sleep.
Ever?
How old are you?
Not in front of... in front
of people I don't know.
You slept last night.
The hell I did.
Not in front of a stranger.
What, are you afraid of what you'll
look like with your mouth open?
You have a mean streak in you.
No.
No, I don't.
I still pinch and bite.
OK.
Morning.
I'm still here.
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.
And there's cheese.
Cheese.
You're all bent. Are you sick?
No. Just bent.
Well... Here, have some cheese.
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.
I know. I'm the one that said it.
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...
...some parts wake up faster than others.
Broke parts take a little longer, though.
I, uh, I would've called a cab,
left you a note.
You know, "Call me",
with my phone number.
Actually, I'd have left my answering
service number, just stuck it on the...
What's the matter?
I wanna know what's botherin' you.
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.
The problem is you get up slowly, I get
up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.
I was up before the sun
ever hit your room.
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?
Good mornin', Alice.
Good morning.
You're right. We are in a hurry.
But let's say we lighten up a bit.
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.
We're gonna be travelling together
a little while...
Oh...
There. All lightened up.
...
.
...
....
...
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.
Hell, you can name anything anything.
It's like those people who
look up at the stars and see things.
Chickens and bulls and chariots
and snakes and shit...
What's this guy's name who's supposed
to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.
Probably there was a falls here once.
This whole land was under water
millions of years ago.
If you go... if you go slow,
take your time and you look real close...
...you can find skeletons of these
weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...
...long, long gone.
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...
...everything, was under an ocean once.
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...
...that you know all that. It's interesting.
Well, this country's where I live.
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.
Oh, yeah, you do.
How'd you know to find me?
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there,
but you were the one that found me.
Just had a few hunches
and got a head start.
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.
Let's go.
Here, give me that stuff here.
OK, I want you to put
your left foot right here.
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.
We're not gonna get anywhere
with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.
That's it. There you go.
Here.
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.
.
.
-
- .
...
...
.
.
.
.
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?
- What is it?
- Just notes.
Can I see 'em?
They're just my notes.
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.
- Well, read 'em.
- No.
You got a secret?
"I feel I'm seeing this country
for the first time."
"Not looking down
from a jet 30,000ft up...
...but from the low angle... of a special
man who means to cross it on foot...
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to
a secret destination... to a private goal."
"To a fairness that he intends
to find in these valleys."
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.
Nice.
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.
She ordered a camera crew
to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.
The sales figures again, exactly.
In the three days since he took the horse,
office equipment has been as projected...
The cereal.
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.
And by closing time today
they'd emptied the shelves.
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?
Well, sir, there's something here
that I think you should be aware of.
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.
Now that's not supposed to be there.
Or we're not supposed to be here.
lost?
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.
Maybe... Do...
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.
Oh!
Here, here...
You OK?
Are you all right?
A- OK.
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.
Maybe you ought to sit down.
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.
Oh... God, my back.
Easy.
Let's take a look.
You just relax, cos we're makin'
good time, don't worry.
Hold on.
Here.
Oh.
Little hair of the dog.
Oh!
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.
I won't be long.
Hi, there. What's your name?
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.
You, uh... you taking care
of this place all by yourself?
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.
Every time it snows up at Marysville,
first thing, the phone goes out.
Where's your car?
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out,
and my car went on the blink.
And I, uh... I need
to get a message to my boss.
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?
Well, we got a phone at home.
I bet you could call for me
and get a message to him.
Could you do that? How much
do you charge to make a call?
One dollar.
That's fair. OK, let me
give you the phone number...
...and when you get him on the phone, ask
for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.
And tell him you're calling for me...
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off
everything. I'll explain when I see him.
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.
- About the flu?
- No, the . I'll write it out for you.
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?
Well, it...
Well, it didn't really break down,
it's just acting...
And I have to call her boss about it.
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.
Found us a spot.
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.
Serves you right.
There's a place we can cross the road
about a mile south.
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.
We're that close?
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.
Isn't there some closer place where
you guys take horses to let 'em go?
No. I just usually use the one, myself.
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...
Well, you're not. Come on.
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.
He had a voice that was
just like runnin' molasses.
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just
havin' been dumped on by some bull...
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's
voice'd come sailin' across...
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.
That horse used to ju...
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh,
runnin' right off at the mouth.
I enjoyed it.
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.
It's been a long haul.
Somethin' bothering you?
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares,
do you just... do you just do the same?
What do  think?
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".
No. I like you bein' smart.
It's just sometimes you're so busy
being clever that I don't...
When was the last time
you were surprised?
You.
You were a surprise.
I told them.
Wha... Who?
I, uh...
I called the network and I told them
you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.
And I asked them to meet me there
with a camera crew.
Oh.
And that's not all.
Oh, now for the  news?
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.
Well.
Well, well, well.
What  you know.
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.
Don't be like that. Hit me,
yell at me, slap me or something.
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.
You did it.
Hey, how about my letter?
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?
Oh, please!
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.
- Why?
- I want him at  place.
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...
...you did, now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either
all goin' to heaven or we ain't.
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.
Let it finish.
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.
I've been hurt. I still get up.
Thanks for the worry.
Do me a favour?
Tomorrow... don't take notes.
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.
Better get off.
How soon before we get there?
We  there.
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.
Appears not.
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?
They... they must be at another entrance.
Ain't no other entrance.
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.
I doubt it.
Well, where the hell are they?
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?
They'd be about 90 miles north.
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?
You...
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.
When our own investigation
revealed the truth...
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.
I don't think there's enough food
to last another night.
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.
Well, Star, you wanna
say goodbye to the lady?
Hey, boy.
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.
OK.
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.
Only they've never been broke. But
they ain't won no championships neither.
So when you cross that stallion
and he wants to fight...
...you remember, you got the blood
on your side. And you can take him.
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.
Make somethin' outta yourself now.
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.
OK, bye-bye.
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.
Oh. Good.
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.
What did they say?
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.
Especially now that Ampco
has reversed its position.
Yeah, I'll bet.
They have me going to Paris next
to cover the elections.
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?
Yes, please.
Just a little somethin' for the road.
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.
Tell me, Norman...
...did you think it'd be this tough
to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?
Ma'am, I had no idea.
All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...
It'd be nice if you didn't mention
where it was that we let him go.
Silver Reef?
Be nice if you didn't divulge  source.
I don't know, leave out a name like that...
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.
Find me somethin' simple.
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.
Any bags, ma'am?
Uh, no.
Uh, hey...?
I keep wantin' to thank you.
But then I keep wonderin' what for.
I know. I know. Me too.
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel
whenever I see you on television.
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.
So...
All aboard, ma'am.
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.
Have a safe trip back now.
All charges have been dropped,
and, sources say...
...the Ampco art department
is hard at work designing a new logo.
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...
...nothing further is known.
So ends the bizarre saga
of horse racing's most honoured stallion...
...and the man who set him free.
Except for one note of thanks
from this reporter to Mr Steele...
...for his... cooperation
in bringing this story to you.
