ANNOUNCER: Previously on
AMC's "Hell on Wheels..."
Fifty thousand dollars... now.
Where's the money, New York?
I am between transactions.
We need to find a way to pay them,
or we will be hip deep in blood.
And ain't no scheme in
the world gonna save us.
How much do you think I'm worth...
Were I to go missing?
- I got a job for you.
- Who're we killin'?
No one dies.
I found the money.
The funds are being wired.
Why... !
Stop!
-
- No!
DURANT: There are only three
others like it on this planet.
Imagine how valuable it is.
That, sir, is no trinket, oh, no.
That is a piece of history,
forged from the golden spike.
- Golden what?
- Spike!
The great transcontinental railroad?
- Didn't you learn anything in school?
-
I didn't go to school.
The marriage of the mighty Union Pacific
and the significantly less mighty
Central Pacific Railroad Companies
connecting at last the east and
west of this great nation.
Let that be a history lesson...
Free of charge.
I can give you the going rate.
$37.27.
But I'll give you $37.30 even...
For the history lesson.
Fine.
DURANT: On the ride down,
people were behaving like they'd never
seen strawberries in winter before.
Please!
Even Quail a la Chasseur
loses its charm.
- I needn't tell you.
- Oh, I love a good quail!
A la whatever you please.
We served quail at our wedding.
Yes, we did, and we were very sorry you
couldn't be in attendance, Thomas.
Yes, yes. Well, I was on The Continent.
Uh, business in London waits
for no man these days.
What we did, sir, let
no man put asunder.
And I must say, though I am positively
rhapsodic to see you looking so well.
I feared the crash of '73
would've shaken your foundations.
Oh, heavens, no, no, no, no.
Only a fool doesn't diversify.
Bella here is the very
ambassadress of diversification.
- Aren't you, mon petit chou?
- Guilty, mon coeur!
Pretend you have some
manners, for the lady's sake.
Don't insult me.
Were we not in the company of said lady,
I would call you what you are.
What's that?
- A jackass, my dear.
-
- All right, you win.
-
And we thank you very kindly, sir.
Mr. Durant, thank you.
The food was divine.
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing at all.

Miss Palmer? Maggie? Did
you hear what I said?
$250,000 or Thomas Durant dies.
The note says to contact
the Union Pacific Board.
- That's just what we'll do.
- No, we should contact the fort.
A government official was murdered.
Martin Delaney was a railroad employee
and Thomas Durant is its president.
That makes this a railroad matter
to be dealt with by railroad personnel.
Now, I'm the only stockholder in this
town with the authority to handle it.
We'll do just what they say.
We'll contact the board.
The board will pay. They have to.
You give him the note, he telegraphs
the board of the railroad,
they pay, we all go home rich.
It was a simple plan, John.
Yeah, a simple plan that turned to shit.
I adapted.
By killing the Chief Engineer
of the Union Pacific
in front of a newspaper reporter?
The railroad will pay twice as
fast now blood's been spilled.
Blood brings guns, not money.
They'll have our heads in the noose!
My head, not yours!
I was the one on the train. Not you!
It's me at risk here, all right?
Delaney's death was a tragic,
unforeseen consequence.
But it's in the past,
it's out of our hands.
We need to control and I mean control...
What happens next.
From the inside.
MICKEY: You think it was
ranchers behind this?
No, no. Thomas paid them off.
There was no way any of us could have
predicted what happened, Miss Palmer.
Durant burned this whole town with
his land scheme and I helped...
I helped him create more
enemies than you can count.
The board will pay, Maggie.
Once these men get what they want,
Durant will walk free.
It'll be over soon.
It's from the Union
Pacific in New York...
The Union Pacific board is
refusing to pay the ransom.
They've referred the matter
to the federal government.
Laramie's welcome wagon,
led by a criminal...
No surprise there.
I'm a Union Pacific
shareholder now, Governor.
I hope you have bags of money following
you off that train, for Durant's sake.
I didn't get elected by caving to
demands of thugs and ransomers.
When we find the men responsible,
the only payment they'll
receive is swift justice.
They're not gonna pay, Eva.
And when they don't...
- Campbell's gonna get him killed.
- Oh, hell with Campbell.
We'll start a collection.
I got $1,000.
Spends just as good as
any government money.
Plus I got a horse. I could sell him.
Keep your horse, honey.
There ain't enough assets in this
whole damn town to raise the ransom.
Who could've done this?
LOUISE: From his accent,
the leader was Irish.
What did he say to you?
"Up. Move."
Short words. He was...
He was trying not to speak.
After Marty tried to stop him...
He didn't have to shoot him.
And after the leader murdered
Mr. Delaney?
There were two riders who
held up the railroad crew.
They put Durant on a horse and rode off.
Look, Durant always owes people money.
If we can look at the
Railroad's books...
- The books?
- LOUISE: Yes.
We follow Durant's debts, then
we can find out who did this.
Right then, I'll release the books.
Anything to help.
I just need consent from
the board members first.
We don't have time to
waste on the damn board!
You've had a difficult
day, Miss Ellison.
- Don't patronize me.
- You're lucky to be alive.
BENDIX: In which
direction did they ride?
I'm sorry?
Even a starting direction
would help, madam.
North.
They rode north.
- That's enough.
- Get to it, Major.
- We have to call it off.
- No chance.
I ain't risking the rope to
walk away with empty pockets.
There's no money, John.
Campbell won't pay.
John Campbell cannot afford the
political fallout of my death.
- He will pay.
- He's brought the cavalry onto us.
And they have Indian trackers,
who are going to find us.
- And when they do...
- If they do.
We'll just have to get rid
of the witness, Michael.
Oh, you're going to kill me, Mr. Shea?
JOHNNY: Yeah. You think
you can stop me, old man?
Nobody's killing nobody.
Now, you brought me into this
because I know how to run a job.
You gotta trust me, Doc.
You say Campbell will pay.
We just have to make
that his only option.
You all right?
Marty was a good man.
A friend.
And now he's dead, for what?
Just a little bit of money, that's it.
Oh, I'll be fine. No
need to worry about me.
- Miss Ellison.
- Governor.
- Shouldn't leave a scar.
- Thank you.
Railroad's account books.
Government audit.
Oh.
Thank you.
- Louise.
- John.
I regret our last conversation.
The way things ended...
Before the railroad
moved on from Cheyenne.
I've put Cheyenne behind me.
Where it belongs.
I hope you find something.
Inside! Go! Now!
What is this?
_
If they don't get their money, the next
body we see will be Thomas Durant's.
CAMPBELL: Message Secretary McCulloch.
Tell him we need $250,000 wired
to the Laramie Central forthwith.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
The son of a bitch needs
to finish what he started.
Grant needs this damned
road done and so do I.
I don't care about your reasons.
Thank you, John.
They knew we were coming, Major.
And the "Irish accent,"
the lady reported.
Trail McGinnes.
- The Major is awful interested in you.
- I know it.
Where's Shea?
What'd you do?
Mickey.
What the hell did you do?
I'm in trouble, Eva.
Durant, he hired us.
Nobody was supposed to get hurt...
But Shea...
He killed Delaney.
We killed that soldier today.
Listen here, Mickey.
Shea won't blink at killing Durant.
And he's been trouble ever since
he showed up in Cheyenne.
You know what you've got to do.
And what, pray tell, is that?
You've got to kill that mad dog.
Look at my face.
What is it you see here that makes
you think I'd murder my own kin?
You know I'm right.
DURANT: Charming.
What's that, Fatty?
You remind me of a gorilla
I saw once in a traveling circus.
Only the gorilla had better breeding.
You'd be wise to mind your hole
or I'm liable to give y'another.
I'd wager your mother dropped
you on your head more than once
when you were a baby.
Whiskey fingers, as you
well know, can be slippery.
You're nothin' but a
bloated old Mary-Ann.
I should kill you right here and now!
You're an idiot!
A useless, pathetic, idiot.
If you don't shut your hole,
you'll be shittin' your death shit
right here in this murky drink...
Some privacy, please?
Oh.
I think I've a notion of who
you're wantin' for this.
I've not seen my cousin anywhere
since this whole thing started.
Pains me to say it,
but that's what I'm figurin'.
Your own blood.
He's killed Delaney.
He'll kill Durant, too.
We both know what he's capable of.
You saw him take out a man's eye.
I did.
Johnny's never been a very patient man.
You best get that ransom together quick.
Lads.
Campbell thinks it was you behind this.
What in hell made him think that?
Well, we needed a credible threat
for Durant, so I told him.
It's over, John, and so is our
time in this godforsaken country.
- We'll take the money and we'll go home.
- Ireland?
Are you off your head?
It's like I fell asleep on
a train four years ago.
I had a brother, a family...
Dreams of gold.
But it's like I've
woken up, I'm alone...
In hell.
You're not alone, sure. You've got me.
America's an awful bitch.
I'm done with it.
Would you listen to yourself?
You're a big man here.
You have whores, cash.
You have a saloon.
You've a stake in a railroad,
for Christ's sake.
There's nothing back home but
bleedin' famine and Englishmen.
At least we can breathe there.
And with the money from this
job, John, we could run things.
You know what?
You're god damned right.
They're gonna pay.
Of course they'll pay.
We can't have the country's
most consequential businessman
taken by bandits.
And they'll keep quiet about it.
It's the American Way!
Aye.
It must be exhausting,
being so consequential.
CAMPBELL: Make the drop. But
not until Thomas Durant
has been handed over to your custody.
Understood.
Major Bendix and his men
will finish with Mr. Shea.
Maggie... A word.
You're too late, Miss Ellison.
Johnny Shea killed Mr. Delaney
and kidnapped Durant.
McGinnes turned him in.
Why?
No loyalty amongst rats.
Maggie,
Durant told you he wired for
money to pay off the ranchers?
Yes.
I've been through the books.
There's no wire.
- He sold his personal stock.
- No, he didn't.
He's broke.
Ransom yourself.
- That's one way to solve that problem.
- A man was killed.
- Your friend, murdered.
- Yes, and I wasn't.
I'm not lucky to be alive.
I think Shea was told not to kill me
on that train by Thomas Durant.
What you are suggesting is beyond absurd.
This isn't a dime novel.
You don't know what happened
on that train, Louise.
You were there but you don't know.
I'm telling you, Maggie.
Shea was following orders.
Unpack that cash.
I'll squander neither money nor lives.
- We wait.
- Your waiting is gonna get him killed.
- We only have a few hours before...
- Listen to me...
Miss Ellison may just be right.
Durant is just the kind of
man to do such a thing,
arrange his own kidnapping.
- No.
- If she's wrong, if we're wrong...
Durant's no worse off than he is now.
If we're right, won't be long before
he waltzes through that door.
Of course, he'll have to stand trial
for what
befell his chief engineer on that train.
Fine.
Do what you want.
Bring me Mickey McGinnes.
DURANT: John Campbell is not
going to let the murderer
of the chief engineer of the
Union Pacific railroad go free.
He will hunt your cousin
down until he finds him.
And when he finds him...
Do you think we can rely
on that thing up there?
It would be prudent to tie things off.
No loose ends.
You're absolutely right.
That would be the prudent thing to do.
So when these bastards get here,
and drop that money off,
that thing up there and
me are gonna take it
and get the hell out of this shit hole.
No, you're not.
That's what we're doing. There's not
a damn thing you can do about it,
so I don't want to hear another
word out of your mouth.
Rider approaching!
Maggie? What are you doing here?
No one else thought you
were worth saving.
We'll be needin' the cash, darlin'.
Come on.
There's $50,000 in there.
You just take it and go.
Look, we need to take this money
and get the hell out of here. Now.
Take the damn money.
Take it and get of here.
$250,000. Not 50.
It's not enough.
It's enough for the life that we want.
Enough for the life you want, maybe.
Damn it, John, will ya listen to me?
McGinnes?
No.
-
-
Maggie...
Jesus... Maggie!
I...
Maggie, Maggie.
No loose ends.
When the train came to a stop,
the masked man boarded my car.
Dandy Johnny Shea, I later found out.
He shoots my chief engineer,
thoroughly unprovoked,
and forces me off at gunpoint.
We ride on horseback to an
abandoned depot a few miles north,
at the end of a defunct spur.
After a time, maybe half a day,
we moved again.
MICKEY: I liked Miss Palmer.
She was a good woman.
A good businesswoman.
Anyway,
I was meeting a man out at
Soda Springs when it happened.
He sells these.
Grapefruit.
A bit more bitter than I'd hoped.
Go on.
Ugh!
Exotic, isn't it?
When the time came...
Yes?
DURANT: When the time came,
Maggie Palmer rode up over the ridge.
She had a sack of money.
And Dandy Johnny Shea...
He picked up the bag,
shot her dead
and rode away, if I had to guess.
- Where would he go?
- MICKEY: Christ if I know.
Uh... I'd start anyplace
that sells liquor or whores.
He could still be in Wyoming.
He could be in New York.
Uh, California...
Ireland.
He could be anywhere.
I don't know.
One
thing's gnawing at me.
Why didn't he kill you?
I don't know, John.
Maybe he got tired of all the death.
I know I am.
I'm free to go, I assume.
I know what happened out there.
I know the whole story.
I can't prove it.
But I know it.
I've told you the whole story.
There's nothing else to know.
That $50,000...
She sold her hotel to save you.
Sometimes I don't know where
this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even
see the reason why
But I guess I'll keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
Oh, it's easier than just
a-waitin' 'round to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
But he beat her with a
belt once cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
She headed down to Tennessee
I killed him.
Oh, it's easier than just
a-waitin' 'round to die
I killed my cousin.
I killed my brother.
- Stop...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
A friend said he knew
where some easy money was
We robbed a man and
brother did we fly
And it's two long years just
a-waitin' 'round to die
He don't steal or
cheat or drink or lie
And together we're gonna
wait around and die
