THE ROADS WE TAKE
We ain't got long to wait here.
They'll be on our trail.
What are we going to do
about a hoss for you, Bob?
Oh, I guess that can use of
yours'll  carry double for a while.
We'll annex the first animal
we come across.
By jingoes, we made a haul,
didn't we?
According to the marks
on this money there's 30,000 –
It's short of what I expected.
Old Bolivar's mighty nigh played out,
I wish that sorrel of yours hadn't got hurt.
So do I, but it can't be helped.
Bolivar will get us both far enough
to get fresh mounts.
What a pity!
Dang it, Shark, I can't help thinking
how funny it is  that an Easterner
like you can come out here
and give us Western fellows cards
and spades in the desperado business.
What part of the East was
you from, anyway?
What?
I say, what part of
the East was you from?
- I'm from New York State.
- New York?
I got here by sheer luck.
I was walking along the road
with my clothes in a bundle,
making for New York City.
I had an idea of going there
and making lots of money.
I always felt like I could do it.
I came to a place where the road forked
and I didn't know which fork to take.
I studied about it for half an hour,
and then I took the left-hand.
and I went West with it.
Well done!
I've often wondered...
if I wouldn't have turned out
different if I'd took the other road.
Oh, I reckon you'd have
ended up about the same.
It ain't the roads we take,
it's what's inside of us that makes
us turn out the way we do.
I'd a good deal rather that sorrel
of yours hadn't hurt himself, Bob.
Same here,
he was sure a first-rate
kind of a crowbait.
But Bolivar, he'll pull us
through all right.
Reckon we'd better be moving on,
hadn't we, Shark?
- Stop your funning! We got to be hitting
the breeze. - Set still!
Set still! You ain't going
to hit no breeze, Bob.
I hate to tell you, but there ain't
any chance for but one of us.
Bolivar, he's plenty tired,
and he can't carry double.
We been pards, me and you,
for three year, Shark Dodson.
We've risked our lives together
time and again.
I've always give you a square deal,
and I thought you was a man.
I've heard some queer stories
about you shooting one or
two men in a peculiar way,
but I never believed 'em.
You don't know how bad I feel,
about that sorrel of yourn
breaking his leg, Bob.
Now if you're just having a little
fun with me, Shark,
put your gun up.
If you mean to shoot – shoot!
Shoot, you blackhearted son
of a tarantula!
Bolivar cannot carry double.
Ahem! Peabody,
I must have fallen asleep?
Yes, sir.
I had a most remarkable dream.
What is it, Peabody?
Mr. Williams, sir, is outside.
He has come to settle his deal.
The market caught him
short, sir, if you remember.
Yes, I remember.
What is quoted at today?
– One eighty-five, sir.
Then that's his price.
Excuse me, sir, but he say he's
an old friend of yours, Mr. Dodson,
and he would like to speak with you...
And he's waiting...
- Okay. Let him in.
- Yes, sir.
Williams...
Listen, Dodson,
we been pards, me and you...
I've always give you
a square deal.
I'm very sorry that it happened...
You bought up all stocks.
I think you might...
If you remember
I sold you the stock at 98.
Yes, I remember...
...at 98.
Listen Dodson, if I
settle at the market price,
as you are asking me to do,
I will lose money - be ruined!
This would be my downfall.
I ask you, please...
Please...
I hate to tell you,
but there ain't
any chance for you.
One eighty-five.
Bolivar cannot carry double.
MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN
Lay still! I say lay still!
Hands up!
Up with the other one.
You might be amphibious
and shoot with your left.
You can count two,
can't you?
Hurry up,
now!
- Can't raise the other one.
- What's the matter with it?
Rheumatism...
in the shoulder.
Inflammatory?
Was...
The inflammation has gone down.
Don't stand there making faces,
If you've come to burgle
why don't you do it?
There's some stuff lying around.
Excuse me,
it's good for you
that rheumatism and me
happens to be old pals.
I got it in my
left arm, too.
Most anybody but me
would have popped you
when you wouldn't hoist
that left claw of yours.
Tell me please, how long
have you had it?
Four years...
I guess that ain't all.
Once you've got it, it's you for
a rheumatic life – that's my judgment.
- Well, ever try rattlesnake oil?
- Gallons,
If all the snakes I've used the oil
of was strung out in a row
they'd reach eight times
as far as Saturn and back.
- Some use Chiselum's Pills.
- Fudge!
Took 'em five months. No good.
I had some relief the year I tried
Finkelham's Extract... - Finkelhait's.
Yes, Finkelhait's... and when
I used Potts's Pain Pulverizer,
I felt oneself better.
But I think it was the buckeye
I carried in my pocket
what done the trick.
Is yours worse in the morning
or at night?
Night, just when I'm busiest.
Say, take down that arm of yours.
Say! Did you ever try..?
Damn!...
Forgot...
Here is it...
- Ahem! Blickerstaff's
Blood Builder... - Did you?
Blickerstaff's...
- You know, I never did.
- It's a pity.
Does yours come in paroxysms
or is it a steady pain?
It jumps...
It strikes me when
I ain't looking for it.
I had to give up second-story work
because I got stuck
sometimes half-way up.
- I see!
- Tell you what -
I don't believe the blooming doctors
know what is good for it. - Same here.
I've spent a thousand dollars
without getting any relief.
- Yours swell any?
- Of mornings.
And when it's going to rain -
great Christopher! - Me, too...
I can tell when a streak of humidity
the size of a table-cloth
starts from Florida and...
with the approach of it,
I began to feel badly,
And if I pass a theatre
where there's
the moisture starts my left arm
an 'East Lynne' matinee going on,
jumping like a toothache.
- It's undiluted - hades!
You're dead right.
Say, old man,
ever try opodeldoc?
Slop! Might as well rub
on restaurant butter.
Sure, It's a salve
suitable for little Minnie
when the kitty
scratches her finger.
- Sure?
- Sure.
I'll tell you what!
We're up against it.
You are right.
- I only find one thing that
helps in our life. - Fomentations?
Saint Ignatius' nut?
Well, it's a...
Good Booze..! Eh?!
Don't take umbrage at me.
Say, this job's off -
get on your clothes
and let's go out and have some.
The devil take it!
For a week I haven't been able
to dress myself without help.
I'm afraid Thomas is in bed, and...
Climb out, I'll help
you get into your duds.
You know, it's very unusual...
- Here's your shirt.
- Of course.
I knew a man who said Omberry's
Ointment fixed him in two weeks
so he could use both hands
in tying his four-in-hand.
Liked to forgot my money,
laid it on the dresser last night.
Come on. I ask you. Leave it alone.
I've got the price.
Ever try the urine of young pig?
Young? It's interesting...
You know, my uncle...
THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF
Ahem! It's you...
How are you, Sam?
- You know, we have joint capital
of about... - Five hundred dollars.
That's just the point.
We cannot begin new business...
with such money.
To pull off a fraudulent scheme
in Western Illinois, we need more...
...Two thousand dollars.
- But where will we get it?
I know...
I have one brilliant idea.
- Bank robbery?
- No.
Express robbery?
Oh Bill, I am tired of fussing
like this. Listen closely...
The love of children...
The love of children...
It is strong in semi-rural communities.
Did you get me?
- No.
Kid...
Kidnapping.
Sam!
The money is ours in fact.
I've never been engaged in such
business but I think we can risk.
No risk. It is easy and simple.
While you had loafed about,
I had paved the way for it.
Listen to me closely.
I have selected for our victim
the only child of a prominent citizen.
His name is Ebenezer Dorset.
The pop will take out nothing less
than two thousand dollars for his kid.
Don't disturb!
Tomorrow we'll rent a carrriage
in the neighbouring village.
The Dorset's home is uptown.
In the afternoon we'll go
to the country,..
...take the precious kid...
...and hide him in a cave.
Next we'll write a letter
to pop about ransom...
...and get money.
The snot-nosed kid
will be back home...
...and we'll go to Western Illinois
to pull an our scheme off.
You're a bad man on strategy tricks.
I am ready!
Meow!
That's 2000 that lies at our feet.
I'm sure we'll take 'em easy.
Hey, boy!
- Easier!
Hey, little boy!
Would you like to have a bag
of candy and a nice ride?
Wow!
That will cost the old Dorset
an extra five hundred dollars.
Take the boy to the cave
and I'll return the carriage.
– You don't think he'll run away?
– No fear of it.
Boy!
Boy!
Bill!
– Do you live in the woods?
– Yes, in the woods, boy!..
Don't frighten a baby. More ease...
In the woods, little boy.
– Are there any real Indians
here? – Who?
–  Indians. –  No, there are
no Indians here.
– Are you afraid, boy?
– Me? Afraid?
I am a Red Chief indeed!
Got it?
Keep an eye on him! Quickly!
Wait!
Ha! Cursed paleface,
do you dare to enter
the camp of Red Chief?
Hey you, Snake-eye! When my braves
returned from the warpath
you'll be broiled at the stake
at the rising of the sun.
Go! Be ready to be punished.
Go!
And what?
He's all right now. We're playing Indian.
I'm Old Hank, the Trapper,
Red Chief's captive, and
I'm to be scalped at daybreak.
And I heard you'll be
broiled at the stake.
By Geronimo!
That kid can kick hard!
Red Chief! Welcome to wigwam.
I like this fine.
I never camped out before.
We had five puppies.
– Why you have such a red nose,Hank?
– Because... – Hist!
Hist, buddy!
I think there are spies there...
Never mind! He's just a kid.
– Good boy. We was lucky.
– To be sure!
– What about spies?
– Everything is all right!
Why are oranges round?
Why nothing in holes?
I don't like girls.
My father has lots of money.
Are the trees moving
make the wind blow?
Red Chief, would you
like to go home?
Aw, what for?
I don't have any fun at home.
I hate to go to school.
I like to camp out.
You won't take me back home
again, Snake-eye, will you?
Not right away. We'll stay
here in the cave a while.
All right! That'll be fine.
– What happened?
– Psst! Psst, buddy.
– If you will not sleep now,
tomorrow I... – What tomorrow?
Sleep! Now!
Why are you getting up
so soon for, Sam?
Me? Oh, I got a kind
of a pain in my shoulder.
I thought sitting up would rest it.
You're a liar!.. You're afraid...
You were to be burned at sunrise,
and you were afraid he'd do it.
– Ha! You are kidding...
– And he would, too,..
if he could find a match.
– Are you sure?
Do you think anybody will pay out money
to get a little imp like that back home?
– Okay.
– Are you sure?
Adsolutely!
A rowdy kid like that is just
the kind that parents dote on.
Now, you and the Chief get up
and cook breakfast, relax...
...while I'll to scout out.
Oh, I go away...
Sam, maybe I'll to scout out?
No, no, no... I'll go to reconnoitre.
Don't worry!
– Okay.
– Relax!
Well, I go...
What's the matter?
Give back a rock!
I'll get you!
No man ever yet struck the Red Chief
but what he got paid for it.
You'd better beware me!
What's he up to now?
You don't think he'll run
away, do you, Sam?
No fear of it. He don't seem
to be much of a home body.
There don't seem to be much
excitement around town
on account of his
disappearance.
His folks may think he's spending
the night with one of the neighbours.
Anyhow, he'll be missed today.
If you don't behave,
I'll take you straight home!
Now, are you going
to be good, or not?
Are you going to be good after all?
I was only having fun,
I didn't mean to hurt Old Hank.
But what did he hit me for?
Okay, I'll behave, Snake-eye,
if you won't send me home,
and if you'll let me play
the Black Scout today.
What?
– The Black Scout game.
Listen to me carefully.
I don't know the game.
That's for you and Mr. Bill to decide.
Now, you come in and make friends with him
and say you are sorry for hurting him.
Well, let's go!
Or home you go, at once.
He's nice guy, very kind but you had hurt
him when you hit him with a rock.
I'm sorry, Old Hank.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You didn't... I know...
Well, shake each other's hands.
– Well, you can take a walk
and be a good boy.
– I will stay and protect the cave.
Of course! You may do it,
our invaluable friend.
Well, time to take action.
And now we'll write the letter
to old Dorset.
Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.:
Please, Sam make the ransom fifteen
hundred dollars instead of two thousand.
It ain't human for anybody
to give up two thousand dollars
for that forty-pound
chunk of freckled wildcat.
Let be fifteen hundred dollars.
You can charge the difference up to me.
Please, Sam!
Okay... Have it your way.
Thank you. You're always
were a true friend.
Listen to me carefully!
"Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.
We have your boy concealed
in a place far from this city.
Absolutely, the only terms
on which you can have him
restored to you are these:
Listen and be attentive!
We demand two thousand
dollars for his return.
Fifteen hundred dollars, Sam!
Oh, sorry. You're right!
Fifteen hundred dollars...
If you agree to these terms, send your
answer in writing by a solitary messenger
to-night at half-past eight o'clock,
where you'll put later on
two thousand dollars.
– Fifteen hundred dollars, Sam!
Oh, sorry again, Bill!
Fifteen hundred dollars...
More precisely, after crossing Owl Creek,
on the road to Poplar Cove...
I never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped
that two-legged skyrocket of a kid.
He's got me going. – Don't worry.
Everything will go well.
You won't leave me here alone
with him, will you, Sam?
I'll be back some time this afternoon. You must
keep the boy amused and quiet till I return.
Okay. I'm ready.
Aw, Snake-eye, you said
I could play the Black Scout...
...while you were gone.
Play it, of course,
Mr. Bill will play with you.
What kind of a game is it?
– Yes, what kind of a game is it?
– I'm the Black Scout and I have
to ride to the stockade
to warn the settlers
that the Indians are coming.
I'm tired of playing Indian myself.
I want to be the Black Scout.
All right.
It sounds harmless to me.
I guess Mr. Bill will help you
foil the pesky savages.
What am I to do?
You are the hoss.
Get down on all fours!
– Oh, time to go...
How can I ride to the stockade
without a hoss?
Of course...
You'd better keep him interested
till we get the scheme going.
Loosen up.
How far is it to the stockade, kid?
Ninety miles. And you have
to hump yourself to get there on time.
Gee, now!
Hurry back, Sam, as soon as you can.
I wish we hadn't made the ransom
more than a thousand.
Gee up!
Say, you quit kicking me...
...or I'll get up and warm you good.
Forward!
Our city is very peaceful.
We have no any accidents here in fact.
Yes, nice small town.
But whole city was shocked to-day.
What happened?
One of the very respectable
citizens Mr. Ebenezer Dorset...
What?
Ebenezer Dorset...
– Uh! And what about him?
– ...either lost or it was stolen...
– Wallet?
No! His only son.
Really? Is it possible?
Oh my God!
But what our President is doing?
Bill!
Bill! Bill!
Sam, I suppose you'll
think I'm a renegade...
...but I couldn't help it.
Where is the boy?
Where is he?
The boy is gone.
I have sent him home.
What? You sent him home?!
It is all off.
Believe me, Sam, nobody ever was subjugated
to such supernatural tortures as I have been.
I tried to be faithful
to our articles of depredation;
but there came a limit.
What's the trouble, Bill?
Well, I rode the ninety miles
to the stockade, not barring an inch.
Then, when the settlers were rescued,
I was given oats.
Sand ain't a palatable substitute. I tell you,
a human can only stand so much!
I take him by the neck and drag him down
the mountain. On the way he kicks my legs;
and I've got two or three bites
on my thumb and hand cauterized.
But he's gone. Gone home.
– Gone...
I'm sorry we lose the ransom,
But it was either that
or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse.
– That's all.
– All?
Life is beautiful!
Bill, there isn't any heart disease
in your family, is there?
– What? – I say, there isn't
any heart disease in your family?
No, nothing chronic
except malaria and accidents.
– It's nothing!
– Nothing.
– But why?
– It's doesn't matter.
– So, nothing chronic?
– No.
Two Desperate Men!
Gentlemen:
I received your letter today
by post in regard to the ransom
you ask for the return of my son.
I hereby make you a counter-proposition, which
I am inclined to believe you will accept.
Interestingly...
You bring Johnny home and pay me
two hundred and fifty dollars in cash,
and I...
You bring Johnny home and pay me...
To pay him?..
Pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash,
and I agree to take him off your hands.
You had better come at night, for
the neighbours believe he is lost,
and I couldn't be responsible for what they
would do to anybody they saw bringing him back.
Very respectfully,
Ebenezer Dorset.
Barefaced impudence!
Bill, we'll do the next...
Bill!..
Bill!..
Sam, what's two hundred and fifty dollars,
after all? We've got the money.
One more night of this kid
will send me to a bed in Bedlam!
Besides being a thorough gentleman,
I think Mr. Dorset is a spendthrift
for making us such a liberal offer.
Sam! Sam!
You ain't going to let
the chance go, are you?
Tell you the truth, Bill, this little lamb
has somewhat got on my nerves too.
Sam, we'll take him home,
pay the ransom...
...and make our get-away.
Johnny...
Wait! Wait, Johnny!
You know, your father had bought
you a silver-mounted rifle.
– Really?
– Really.
Also, your father
had bought a pair of moccasins.
– Really?
– Really.
And we are going to hunt
bears the next day!
– Will Old Hank come too?
– You bet!
Well, now we'll go to your father, then pass
the night and we'll go to hunt in the morning!
Bill, hold on! Don't give up!
How long can you hold him?
I'm not as strong as I used to be,
but I think I can promise you ten minutes.
Enough...
...in ten minutes we'll be legging it
trippingly for the Canadian border.
