Woman:
so I expect you to get your ass
In the darkest hour
of the longest night
if it was in my power
I'd step into the light
candles on the altar
penny in your shoe
walk upon the water
transcendental blues
Sorry I kept you waiting, Vic.
No, you're not.
So, where are the Barnes boys?
I was sick of the old one
hitting on me,
so I sent them back up
to their truck.
The body
Is way up here,
about 200 yards.
That's a sheep.
I said we had a dead body.
I never said what species.
So, now that you're here,
you got it under control.
I guess I'll go home,
enjoy my day off.
And miss all the fun?
Come on.
We camped out last night
so we could get huntin'
first thing this morning.
We checked it out
and saw that somebody
shot a sheep.
There are no footprints
heading up that hill.
How'd you get close enough
to see the sheep had been shot?
Well, my scope.
Your scope?
Now, normally, we would
ignore a dead sheep,
but I know how it looks --
a couple of guys up here with
a couple of drinks in 'em,
taking target practice.
I swear that ain't
what happened, Walt.
This sucks.
Look, I know I've only
been here six months,
but I'm not exactly a rookie.
You've made that clear.
Just about every day
for six months.
I'm just saying,
I was working homicide in
Philadelphia for five years.
And a dead sheep is a waste
of my talent...
And my time.
Last thing I want to do
is waste your valuable time.
So, why don't you start
knocking on a few doors
and see if anybody
saw anything?
I want a raise.
Seriously, though, Walt,
what kind of messed-up person
shoots a sheep?
I mean, I know they're not
as cute and fluffy
as they're made out to be
and all,
but they're nice enough.
Vic: Walt?
What you doing?
Thinking.
I do that sometimes
before I talk.
You know what they call
a flock of ravens?
Um, no.
An "unkindness" --
an unkindness of ravens.
What the hell is wrong
with "flock"?
"Unkindness" is just
a little more apropos.
Oh, shit.
That a 12-gauge Mossberg?
Hunting accident?
Nah.
Look at his clothes.
More apres-ski
than avid hunter.
Well, it looks like
he went down
before it started snowing.
I'll check with the weather
service, see when that was.
Let's flip him.
Okay. Go.
Careful, careful.
Exit wound
is obviously here.
Means he was shot in the back.
The shooter
could've been anywhere --
high ground, low ground,
behind a tree.
Victim never shot back.
Sometimes you are
so full of shit.
What are you, Cheyenne?
Smell oil,
the gun's been cleaned.
Smell gunpowder,
it's been fired.
I smell oil.
What's wrong?
When you been doing this
as long as I have,
you get so you know
about every face
in Absaroka county.
So, who is he?
That's the thing.
I don't know.
You wait right here,
Mr. Parkford.
Where you been, Walt?
People were asking after you
at the pancake breakfast.
Just out tending to
the police side of the job.
But nice to know you got
the glad-handing covered.
I was just representin'.
Can't serve the community
if we don't talk
to the community, sheriff.
A man got shot and killed
out there.
I think the community
will understand.
I thought the Barneses
were just pulling
another drunken prank.
What happened?
Look who just got interested
in police work.
Walt, if you got yourself
a cellphone,
you could've called me directly
and told me what was up.
I don't need a cellphone,
Branch.
I just need you to be part of the team.
Can't just dip in and out
of the job
when it suits you.
All right, then,
let me help the team.
Who got shot?
A sheep and
a man named Parkford.
And Vic's lead deputy
on this one.
I got ya.
Maybe I should go out there
and apologize to her.
One dead body's enough.
Morning, sheriff.
Ruby, how we doing today?
Well, somebody trashed
Craig Martin's pickup --
sprayed all over it
with spray paint,
uh, mostly derogatory comments,
uh, one specific warning to
women not to breed with Craig.
Okay, I paraphrased that part.
Doc Bloomfield wants
to reschedule your physical.
Vic called four times
wondering when you're gonna send
the ferg out.
And Cady wanted
to confirm lunch.
Call Craig Martin.
Tell him to apologize
to his girlfriend.
"No" on the physical,
and tell Cady we can try
for lunch tomorrow.
Why don't you call her,
sheriff?
She's your daughter.
She likes you better.
And what about Vic?
Is the ferg dressed
for the elements today?
I got some capilene in my car.
Where am I going?
Pronghorn Ridge trailhead.
Vic's out there.
She'll fill you in.
Branch:
I'll go with you, ferg.
No, Branch,
you're staying here.
Victim had
a 12-gauge Mossberg.
Book it into evidence.
These are the plates
on the vehicles --
tell me who owns 'em,
what guns they do
and don't have registered.
See if any of them know
the Barnes boys,
the victim, or if they
heard any gunshots.
This is Wyoming.
Everybody hears gunshots.
Ferg: Where are you going,
sheriff?
To drop the victim off
at the hospital
so doc Bloomfield can get
an autopsy going.
Then I'm going to Wheatland.
That's a five-hour drive.
That's where the victim's from.
This kind of news is best
not delivered over the phone.
You're gonna notify
next of kin?
Ferg, why are you still here?
Sorry.
Hey, Walt,
that's a long-ass drive.
I could do that for you.
You could.
Then you wouldn't be doing
what I asked you to do.
He hasn't done a notification
in a while.
He hasn't done much in a while.
Are you Susan Parkford?
Susan: Mm-hmm.
I'm sheriff Longmire,
Absaroka county.
That's practically Montana.
Yeah.
Uh, could I come in?
Of course.
I just, um -- I just have
a couple questions,
if you don't mind.
Okay.
Um...
Do you know
where your husband is?
Laramie --
at the university.
There's a conference.
He's a high school teacher.
Is he in some kind of trouble?
How long's he been in Laramie?
He left yesterday --
early, before I got up.
Uh-huh.
He a fisherman?
No.
W-well, a little bit,
but those are mine.
I tie flies and sell 'em
to an outfitter
in Jackson hole.
A little extra spending money.
Do you know if he had
any business up in Durant?
Durant? No.
Now, please, t-tell me
what's going on.
Mr. Longmire, sir,
you're -- you're making me
real nervous.
I'm afraid
I have some very bad news.
Your husband, um...
What is it?
He, uh...
What is it?
Please, God, t-tell me.
What's happened?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parkford,
he's, um...
He's gone.
No!
Ruby: Walt, pick up.
You there?
Vic needs to talk to you.
She found something.
Walt?
Walter?
Son of a --
Ugh! Aah!
It's Vic.
Walt: How's it going?
Walt?
What, you finally broke down
and bought a cellphone?
Borrowed one.
Uh, radio's on the Fritz.
Ruby said you called.
Yeah, I found a slug.
Never seen one like it before.
It was about 30 yards
from the body,
I'm looking for the casing.
I've got the Ferg
taking some pictures.
I, uh, I hear you did
the notification.
Yeah. Uh, Parkford's, uh, wife
didn't even know
that Grant was in Durant.
Thought he was in Laramie
for the weekend.
Oh, so then
this is all about sex.
Take it easy, Vic.
When the husband lies about where
he's going for the weekend,
it's always about sex.
So, Vic, did you know that
Branch was running for sheriff?
Branch Connally.
You're shitting me.
I had no idea.
What are you gonna do about it?
It's a free country.
I'll come by in the morning
and pick up that slug,
see if Omar can help us
identify the murder weapon.
You expecting
an invasion, Omar?
Well, thought I'd get started
since I was on Walt time.
What happened to your hand?
Hurt it.
Well, your message said
that you found a big slug,
so I pulled out all the most
popular high-caliber rifles.
This about that thing
in the paper?
No comment.
Ah.
The Longmire "yes."
And if you're here
instead of your deputy,
you think it's murder.
That is a lot of lead.
.45, .70 at least.
None of the rifles I've been
testing are made for this.
Any modern rifles you know of
that shoot this caliber?
No.
Gotta be something old.
Odds are, in this part of
the country, it's a sharps.
Called 'em horse killers.
Take a horse down
from 500 yards.
Pretty valuable antique now.
Now, this gun's
got its drawbacks.
It's heavy, makes a hell
of a lot of smoke,
and with a drop block,
it takes about five seconds
to reload.
Appreciate the help, Omar.
You bet.
Hey, Walt.
The sharps
is a sniper's weapon.
And there are two types
of people that like to kill
from a distance --
cowards and pros.
In my experience,
both are dangerous.
I'll be all right.
Vic.
Vic!
Vic!!
Vic!! Vic!
You find a casing?!
No!
Pants!
Man: So, how can I help you
today, sheriff?
I'm looking for a sharps rifle.
Oh, an original?
Don't have any right now.
But I'll tell you
what I do have --
this Henry "yellow boy" rifle.
Ahh.
It's nice.
And this Colt Peacemaker.
Both used at little bighorn.
Bet you got custer's mustache
back there, too.
Yeah.
No, I'm mainly interested
in the sharps, Dan.
Names of the buyers
and sellers.
Sheriff business.
Well, I've only seen
a few sharps
in the last couple months.
Charles Burnett --
he sold me the real deal,
but he bought it back
a few weeks ago.
Apparently,
Charles' grandfather
was not too happy with him
selling it without asking.
It's sad, though.
We get all kinds of people
in here, you know --
Cheyennes, whites, crows,
all kinds,
just selling off family
heirlooms to make ends meet.
Any other names come to mind?
Oh, I file all the guns
I buy and sell with the ATF.
So, I'll check my office
if you don't mind waiting.
I'm very good at waiting.
Hey, Walt, when
we expanded the grid
to look for the casing,
we found something else --
pants.
Just tell me on the way
to the res.
Okay.
Talk to Branch yet
about the knife in your back?
Just hop in. 'Cause I want
to be there when you do.
What the hell happened
to your truck?
And your hand --
you hurt your hand.
You're right.
You should consider a career
in law enforcement.
Vic: They were a good 75 yards
from the victim.
The problem is
they're wranglers.
Pretty common pants,
pretty common size.
Just that buckle.
Let me see that.
What? You recognize it?
Maybe.
I can't think of why.
Here.
"Tommy Proud Eagle,
Charles Burnett,
Jefferson Stone."
All Cheyenne,
all bought sharps rifles
from Dan Estes
in the last year.
That's the gun
that killed Parkford.
In a world where you can buy
an AK-47 off the Internet,
why use an antique like this?
Might be old,
but it still gets the job done.
Any of these guys connected
to Grant Parkford?
Don't know.
That's why I want
to talk to them.
And you think the tribal police
are gonna help us do that?
I like to think
if there's a murder involved,
they'll put aside
petty personal differences
and help us find a killer.
They may not think
that you throwing
their police chief in prison
is exactly petty.
He's the one who decided
to run an extortion racket,
not me.
What did I tell you?!
What the hell?!
Vic! Stop!
That's enough.
He did say he'd knock me out
the next time he saw me.
Didn't really keep your word,
did you, Mathias?
What do you want?
I want to speak to some people
of interest who live on the res.
You don't get it.
You have no authority here.
Those are the treaty rules.
And I know how important
treaties are to you whites.
I know you're pissed at me,
but this is serious.
There's been a murder.
I know the kind of rifle used.
It's rare,
but at least three folks
that live on the res own one.
I was hoping just this once
you let me and Vic on the res.
Give me the list, and we'll
look into it for you --
kind of like
a joint task force.
But I got to tell you,
kind of shorthanded
around here.
We lost
our police chief,
How the hell could you just
stand there and take that?
That son of a bitch
better not step off the res.
For the last time,
just leave it alone.
Fine.
I've tracked down
all the vehicles
parked at Pronghorn Ridge.
Aside from the victim's S.U.V.
and the Barneses' truck,
there were two other vehicles --
one belonged
to a pair of hikers,
the other belongs
to Scott Miller.
Well, aren't you the eager
little beaver?
Scott Miller have a license?
I thought you might ask that.
Also, the weather service
called back.
Told me the snow
came on pretty sudden
around 3:30, 4:00 A.M.
yesterday,
so Parkford was probably
shot before then,
when it was still clear skies
and a full moon.
I talked to Jake Hicks
from the crazy "J" ranch.
He's pissed
about the dead sheep,
but he says he's never heard
of the victim.
And speaking of the victim,
after you left,
I remembered something.
Parkford came into the station
about a month ago.
What?
Our victim came in here
and you --
you didn't tell me?
Uh-oh.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
remember the name immediately.
It's not like you showed me
a picture of the guy.
But I did remember it,
and I'm telling you now.
Maybe if we had a more
up-to-date computer syst--
Why, Branch? Why did the
victim come into my station?
Some friend of his, a woman
named May Stillwater,
was looking
for her missing daughter.
Parkford was helping out.
He brought a photo
of the missing girl.
Her name's Lilly.
And what did you do?
Everything I could.
Parkford wasn't a relative.
Couldn't file
a missing-persons claim,
and he said the girl
was from the res.
By law, that makes it
a tribal police problem,
so I forwarded the info
on to them.
I could've called the feds,
but I know you don't like it
when they get involved.
Why didn't you tell me
any of this at the time?
Well, you haven't exactly been
on top of your game
for the last year.
Vic, the Ferg, and I have been
trying to handle everything,
but it's not easy.
Well, sorry I haven't been
here to hold your hand.
It's called delegating.
That's part of
the sheriff's job, Branch.
Speaking of which,
is there anything else
you forgot to tell me?
Anything you think
I should know?
Anything?
No.
No.
So, where you going now?
To do what you
should have done --
talk to this girl's mom
and find out what the hell
Grant Parkford
was doing in this county.
I know your memory is slipping,
but didn't the tribal police
basically just tell you
to stay the hell
off the reservation?
Well, I never said
it was gonna be easy.
Hey, Henry.
I need a favor.
And I need a wingman.
Gina here does not want
to leave her sister,
and I was just saying
how my best friend
is single, employed,
and almost as charming as me.
How 'bout it?
Dinner in town,
or should we just eat here
at the red pony?
Will you ladies excuse us?
You got to get back
on the horse, Walt.
I appreciate the advice,
but that's not
what I'm here for.
May: Standing bear, I thought
you were coming alone.
Henry: Hello, May.
Those dogs have a sixth sense.
They smell white people.
Who's in the truck?
He wants to help.
May: Well, what the hell
took you so long?
She's been missing
three months.
I'm here now,
and I do want to help.
Do you have any idea
where she may have gone?
Well, if I knew that,
I would've gone after her,
wouldn't I?
Have you heard from her
since then?
Once.
We had a big fight,
and she left.
So she was staying
with some older girl
who left the reservation.
What do you know about the girl
she was staying with?
Not much. They say
she's a prostitute.
My boyfriend?
He says that he thinks
that Lilly's into that, too.
But I don't believe it.
She's only 16.
Is this a recent photo?
Where did you get that?
It was given
to one of my deputies
a couple weeks ago
by a man who said he was helping
you look for Lilly.
Oh, my God.
Grant came to see you?
I didn't realize
he was doing anything.
H-he never
called me back.
But you do know
Mr. Parkford?
Yes, of course.
He's Lilly's father.
He didn't tell you that.
No, ma'am.
Well, I guess he wouldn't.
He asked me to stop calling him
after he got married.
Did you?
Yes -- until last month.
I was so desperate.
Nobody would help.
So I called Grant.
And he said he was sorry
he couldn't do anything.
But I knew he would help.
Grant's a good man.
Henry: May, you said
you have a boyfriend.
He have any idea
where Lilly may have gone?
Charles and Lilly
don't get along.
That wouldn't happen to be
Charles Burnett, would it?
Yes.
Ms. Stillwater, we'll do
all we can to find your girl.
Thank you.
And tell Grant --
tell him thank you, too.
I will.
We pretty much swept the hookers
out of Absaroka last year.
You heard of anything new
about prostitution
in the county or on the res?
Not my thing.
Never had to pay for it.
Have I lost a step?
What?
I just had to ask you
about the state of the sex trade
in my own county.
You are an optimist.
You don't like to think
of the depravity of humankind.
And also, yes,
you have lost a step.
Hardly an optimist.
It's not an hour ago,
I thought Grant Parkford
was just some guy
having an affair.
Never occurred to me he was
doing something heroic.
Heroic?
Trying to save his daughter
from prostitution
seems honorable.
Maybe.
But just because a man
decides to make up for
all his mistakes in one day
does not mean the rest
of the world
is going to be so quick
to forgive him.
Hey, punk.
Hey.
You scared me.
Sorry. I let myself in.
I made some coffee.
What are you
doing here, Cady?
You canceled on lunch and dinner,
and I'm just seeing
if everything's okay.
Hey, I never canceled dinner.
We never planned that.
Oh, okay.
Now, how 'bout
I make us some pancakes?
No, I got to be in court.
What happened to your hand?
I hurt it.
This job -- you have got
to be more careful.
Well, you may not have to worry
about that much longer.
Branch Connally's decided
to run against me,
so I might be
out of a job soon enough.
Where did you get that?
From inside.
It's amazing that I found
anything in there.
The place is even more of a mess
than last time.
I was looking for coffee,
and I found that.
You've got mom's ashes
in the kitchen.
I'm worried about you, dad.
I think you might need some help.
I don't need any help.
The house is a disaster area.
I'm fixing it up.
I'm remodeling.
With beer cans?
Well, if we're not gonna
have any breakfast,
I have some work to do.
I heard about the accident,
and I heard that you had empties
all over your truck.
I wasn't drinking.
I really think you need
to talk to someone.
I talk to people
all day long, Cady.
What I could really use
is a break from all the talking.
You need to deal with this.
People are asking me
where they can visit mom.
Scatter her ashes.
Put them in an urn
at a mausoleum.
Put her name on a freaking
bench, but deal with it.
Because I'm not gonna watch you
just wallow in this
for another year.
You're gonna be late for court.
Okay.
Morning, Dan.
Walt.
I went back five years
in my records
and found some more sharps
rifles buyers and sellers.
Thanks.
Is there something else?
Yeah -- these sconces.
Consider selling 'em?
They're not mine to sell.
I'll give you $800 for 'em --
a lot more for the bookcases.
How'd you end up
with such amazing pieces
in a sheriff's station?
Long time ago, this place
used to be a library, so...
Vic, give me those pants.
If I had a dime for every time
a man said that to me...
I remember why
the belt buckle on the pants
looks so familiar --
it's from the old
Never heard of it.
That's 'cause it's called
the Driggs ranch now.
Used to be 10 point.
Garrett: I told the sheriff
you all would cooperate,
so I expect you will.
We found something out
at Pronghorn Ridge trailhead.
And we want to return them
to their owner.
Anyone recognize these?
No?
Okay.
Take off your pants.
Hello, Cinderella.
Colton: They're wranglers.
They could belong to anybody
in the state.
Not wearing this belt.
Colton, that is the buckle
I gave to you
on your 21st birthday.
What the hell is going on?!
I was out there
trying to get laid.
Who were you there with?
Nobody.
I mean, I went out there alone.
Just you and a herd
of soft, compliant sheep?
What? No. No.
My boys dared me to go out there
'cause that's where the --
the girls that you pay to...
You mean hookers?
Colton, there aren't
any prostitutes
anywhere near Pronghorn Ridge.
Well, not now.
They moved the RV.
The RV?
Yeah.
They move around so folks
like you can't find 'em.
Hey!
You were with a prostitute
in an RV?
Yeah, but we didn't do anything,
all right?
I mean, we started -- started to
kind of get into it, and this --
this big guy walked in,
and I-I was like --
I was like, "Whoa,
hang on, dude."
But then -- but then
he threw me out
without my damn pants on.
Can you describe the big guy?
Big.
I didn't get
a good look at him.
What about the girl?
Told you, my friends
wanted proof that --
they dared me to go out there.
You say they, um...
They move this RV around
so folks like me can't find it.
How do folks like you
go about finding it?
I don't know.
The girl in this photo,
the one you paid
to have sex with --
she's 16 years old.
Now, that's statutory rape
in the state of Wyoming.
Yeah, but I never had sex
with her.
You answer the damn question!
If you want to know
where the RV's at,
go talk to the Indian
at the red pony.
What the hell have you gotten
yourself into, Henry?
Henry: Jukebox is broke.
It only plays country.
That's not
what I'm asking about.
Well, then
I guess you better tell me
what you are asking about
so I can give you
a better answer.
Are you running some kind of
escort service out of this bar?
Well?
I'm only gonna wait so long
for you to crack a smile, Walt,
then I'm gonna have to assume
that you're not kidding.
I asked you
a very simple question.
No. You asked me
a very confusing question.
Really?
'Cause I was just talking
to a young man
who gave me some inside info.
Said if you're looking
for female company
in Absaroka county
and you were willing
to pay for the pleasure,
you should go to the red pony
and talk to the Indian.
So...38 years, then.
We have known each other
for 37 years,
so 38 years must be
how long you have to be
Walt Longmire's friend
before he trusts you.
I'm trying to find the person
that murdered Grant Parkford,
and I'm pretty sure
whoever that is
will lead me
to that missing girl.
Well, you better
get going, then.
I managed to get my hands
on Charles Burnett's gun
by talking
to the tribal police.
They were happy to help.
I served a search warrant,
got the rifle,
plus a box
of old black-powder shells.
This is not the murder weapon.
How can you tell?
We didn't even get a chance
to run the ballistics tests.
There.
We just did a ballistics test.
If you don't clean these rifles
that use black-powder shells,
the black powder
corrodes the metal.
This weapon's a mess.
Unlock him, Ferg.
See him to the door.
You didn't have to do that.
You didn't have to make
a big deal out of it
in front of everybody.
You know, Walt, I haven't
made a big deal
over you not showing up
for work, calling in sick,
or just sitting in here
reading a book
while the rest of us
cover for you.
Sounds like
you're already writing
negative campaign ads.
I saw the sign, Branch.
Nice photo.
They weren't supposed to go up
till I talked to you.
You really think you're the man
for this job, Branch?
I'll leave that
up to the people.
But given a choice
between some fresh thinking
and a tired, absentee sheriff
driving around
with empty beer cans
all over
the floor of his truck,
I like my odds.
I heard about
your little accident.
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
back there, Branch.
But before you start
spreading any accusations,
consider this.
Every man that's ever
had a beer with me
will tell you the same thing.
I drink rainier.
Always have, always will.
Those beer cans?
They weren't rainier,
none of 'em.
I picked 'em up 'cause
I hate looking at litter.
Everyone knows that, too.
"Hound of the Baskervilles,"
Sherlock Holmes.
If you're gonna be sheriff,
you need to start brushing up
on your detective work, son.
Ruby: Sheriff?
Susan Parkford.
Of course.
Susan: Am I interrupting?
No. No, no. I'm sorry.
You told me to --
Official I.D.
I just want to see the body.
Of course.
I-I, uh, I also need
to apologize.
For what?
The other day, um...
I also know what it's like
to lose someone.
This is
the one-year anniversary
of my own wife's passing.
The day I visited you,
I tried to put that
out of my mind,
and you opened the door.
I smelled perfume.
Jo Malone?
That's what my wife wore.
And I only hope I didn't
make the situation worse.
Was he having an affair?
I can handle it.
I mean, knowing is better
than not knowing, so, please.
Your husband
wasn't having an affair,
but I discovered
something else.
Long before he married you
or even met you,
your husband had a daughter.
Now, she's gone missing,
and Grant was trying
to help find her.
Grant had a daughter?
Your husband was just a man.
We're all idiots.
We make mistakes,
and we don't like people
knowing about our mistakes.
But Grant was one
of the good ones.
He was trying
to make things right,
and he was trying to do it
without hurting you.
Mrs. Parkford, I swear,
I'm gonna find out who did this
to your husband.
Does it ever stop hurting?
Not really.
I guess the only way
it could ever stop hurting --
if we could forget about 'em.
And that's the thing, 'cause...
I don't want
to forget anything.
Bob: Okay. Present.
Present. Okay.
Hey, Bob, a couple questions
I forgot to ask you
the other day.
I don't like
to forget anything.
I don't know if this
is really a good time.
Come on in.
So -- so, Bob,
you and your son weren't
really hunting the other day,
were you?
I know about the mobile brothel
that was parked out there.
What are you --
Bob, there's no crime
against being an idiot.
But lying about it --
that can be a problem.
Okay.
Well, we really intended
to go hunting,
and -- and then we saw the RV
and changed our plan.
We, uh, came back into town
and hit the ATM,
then we -- we headed
back out there
to spend a little time
with the ladies.
How did you know, just from looking
at the RV, it was a brothel?
Oh, man, we know that RV.
The old one with the
red-white-and-blue stripe on the side.
When it ain't out working,
it's parked here.
Who owns it?
I don't know.
Ah.
A Ch-- a Cheyenne kid.
His name's Avo.
Any idea
where I might find him?
He's usually working.
He's a busboy over
at the red pony like that.
Wow.
A roadblock.
This seems like overkill.
You could have just called
to apologize.
Hello, Henry.
I have a name for you,
plus three other matters.
Is "Avo" the name?
The other Indian
at the red pony.
Avo's the owner of the RV
these girls have been
working out of.
What are the three
other things?
First,
while I could not find
Avo myself,
we spoke through a cousin.
Avo will meet you tomorrow
morning, 11:00 am.
There is an old, empty cabin
about three miles
off the highway
near the South entrance
of the res.
Second -- I do not think
you should go.
It sounds like a setup,
and there's already
one dead white guy.
What's the third thing?
Since you will no doubt ignore
me and go meet Avo anyway,
I would like to propose
an O.I.T.
O.I.T.?
Old Indian trick.
Morning, Avo.
You're early.
Old Indian trick.
Surprise is a powerful weapon.
Speaking of which,
would you mind telling me
why you came three hours early
to your own meeting?
And if you can tell me unarmed,
I'd appreciate that.
Sheriff,
I didn't kill that guy.
You got to help me.
Let's talk.
The dead guy --
I met him a couple times.
He came into the red pony.
Said he was looking
to get laid.
Everybody knows
if you want to get laid,
you talk to the Indian
at the red pony.
What did you do?
I sent him to the girls.
That was a mistake.
I heard later
he was freaking out
when he got to the RV,
yelling and waving
a gun around.
So when he came back the other
day, I said, "No way, man."
He came back after causing
a scene like that?
He apologized and said
he was upset the first time
'cause what he was really
looking for was an Indian girl.
Guess that's his thing.
He wanted to poke a Pocahontas.
Anyway, I didn't want a problem
with that crazy guy,
so I told him where to go,
but I called it in right away.
I told them,
"Better move the RV."
I didn't know
he was gonna kill him.
I swear.
Who is "he"?
Avo, whoever "he" is,
is trying to frame you.
Now, the only way
I can protect you
is if you tell me
who you're working for.
Understand?
I don't know, man.
Ugh!
Who's out there?
Who is it?
I'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to
be here.
I'm doing my job, Dan.
You got to help me, Walt.
Help me.
Call an ambulance.
After you tell me
about Grant Parkford.
Who?
I'm a patient man.
I was just trying
to make a living.
That man was bad for business.
I warned him.
I swear.
I did, all right?
Now call me an ambulance!
And Lilly, Grant's daughter?
Tell me where Lilly is.
If not, I bury you here.
Okay. Okay.
Montana, Talmer Ridge,
off route 43.
Where are you going, Walt?
Walt!
Call me an ambulance!
I don't have a cellphone.
