He's wrong, Juanito.
He mustn't do it. Listen to me.
What did he say?
Juanito, as I told you before,
there is too much violence in the world.
And beside that, there's another reason.
I don't want our friend Sabata to get hurt now.
But the Murdocks deserve to die, Padre
You know the Murdocks
stole everything from us here.
- They should be punished.
- Juanito.
Have you forgotten what I taught to you?
You must try to forgive,
not s nk nto revengo
- I know, Father.
- Go tell Sabata this.
He shouldn't risk his neck
for those Murdock brothers.
Tell him our prayers are his.
He doesn't need to fight.
But as our Good Book often says,
"The Lord will provide."
Yes, Father.
I beg you to be careful, my son.
- The Lord be with you.
- The Lord is Sabata.
Too much violence.
Order arms!
Left face!
Forward march!
- 20 dollars.
- 10 dollars on the Murdocks.
Right.
Ain't nobody betting on the challenger?
- How about you, Ballantine?
- 100 dollars. On the black.
You can spare a dollar, can't you?
Just to keep this shut up, hm?
Black's my favourite colour, friends.
I always win on black.
It's best if we all get the hell out.
Might get a little hot.
I'm looking for a certain man
for a special job. Sabata.
Not now Co m o o n
We're all set for you to go out in style.
Haven't you noticed?
Sabata! You better make him turn!
Hey! Begin the shooting when it stops.
Sabata likes them lying down.
Guess Murdock's nailed for good.
Know w h at m oa n?
- Huh?
- Ah.
Sorry.
That blasted bird needs oil. Here, you go do it.
- No oil, no money.
- Give me that, you little runt!
- Hey, the man you wanted...
- I think I can find him.
Let's go.
You know what Colonel Skimmel looks like.
How about it? Will you accept?
I hoped you'd be able to do this job for me.
Thank you.
Adiós
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need my help.
M ay go w t h yo u??
Ma ko very good tort as
have a not h oryob for yo u
Deliver this to Father Mike.
Tell him that the Murdocks
have found their... great reward...
...and wish to make a contribution.
Hello.
Well... how much did you make, Ballantine?
A mere bagatelle.
I'm here for something more important.
Colonel Skimmel.
We could... work together.
Hey, you!
We Austrians have eyes everywhere.
If you want some advice,
forget about those Mexicans.
Oh!
Hey! Hey, what is this? Get me down!
You pig, you! Do you hear? Cut me loose!
I'll kill you for this, you dirty American dog!
I swear I'll make you pay, filthy Yankee!
Hang around. I'll be back.
You bastard, I'll get you when I'm down!
You play that rotten!
Reach that gate and you're a free man,
subject to the colonel's marksmanship.
Give them a chance. Release
two, three, four of them, altogether.
Long live the revolution!
We appreciate your aid, Garcia.
Colonel Skimmel will be
most generous with you.
Garcia Moreno?
Ah, you did very well, dear Garcia.
You helped us expose
this filthy revolutionary plot.
You also saved my life.
It has not been forgotten.
Our beloved emperor, Maximilian,
and this humble soldier, are very grateful.
In the drawer under the model ship,
you will find your 20 pieces of gold.
Thank you.
The key is there.
Open it.
- Perfect.
- Mm-hm.
As usual.

Everyone here?
M anuo Ga rc a Oto o!
Juan De Los Angeles.
Jesus Rivalta!
Luis Miguel Cortejo.
They're all good men. Yours for the mission.
- I hope you approve.
- Aha.
European money.
Who bought you?
Did you sell out to that pig Skimmel?
He's a spy, Ocano.
Septiembre!
Stand back from the traitor.
Gitano!
Gitano!
The flamenco of death.
No!
Gitano and Septiembre
are all the men I'll need.
That gold will buy us guns.
We'll get stronger than their soldiers
and nobody can stop us then.
The man who'll be helping you is a soldier.
A soldier of fortune.
He'll find out
when the gold leaves Guadalupe
and what road you must follow.
He's made the arrangements
with the men that sell guns.
He's waiting for you in Kingsville, Texas.
- And don't forget the password. Hear?
- I know.
There's still another thing
that I keep worrying about.
Mu st wo oave t h o revo u t o n
up to a so d or o f fort u no??
This one, yes.
He's all right, Escudo. It's Sabata.
Ah. It's very good.
Tequila, a bottle.
It stinks in here.
Smells like pigs are around.
Here, you smell anything, Septiembre?
Your friend has no nose, or he's a liar.
All you mangy pigherders smell disgusting.
You're too full of it to be a judge, my friend.
Well?
Well?
Any time.
Uh-uh.
Isn't it enough you lost a friend?
Aw.
Have a beer!
The smell doesn't bother him any more.
From now on, he's going to learn to smoke.
Thank you, hombre. Many thanks.
If friends are what you need?
Anything for Benito Juarez.
This is our man. This one's Sabata.
Amigo, Ocano sent us to meet you.
N co toc h nkqu o, h u h??
Tco m os w t h b ract co
The last time I played this...
Ah, here it is.
Los Palos, St Christopher's Day.
I've got a bad memory.
Write everything down in the book.
Nover w t h o u t t
Wa t fo r m o o u ts do
Colonel Skimmel appreciates
an artistic type like myself.
Relaxes with me.
In Guadalupe, I'm like one of the family.
Out at the fort every day.
Seeing things, hearing things.
Do you know Colonel Skimmel?
He challenged me to a shooting match once.
- Hard man to beat.
- It remains to be seen.
With four hands, it would be perfect, huh?
I play solo.
Such a pity.
Colonel Skimmel has two pianos.
Why not join me?
I'll play the melody.
Hey, amigo. Is your pal
in there at the piano with us?
He'll keep out of this thing if I can help it.
- What about them? Are you sure they're OK?
- Sure. Who do you think they are?
Hoso two?? Ro octs fro m t h o oca m u so u m
j
Huh, them? They're very good men.
They're my two falcons, two hawks, two eagles.
Two fighting buzzards.
Don't you believe me?
Hey!
See that?
What did I tell you?
And this one is Septiembre.
You want to see something great? Look.
Go ahead.
- Hey, you loco?
- You have nothing to worry about.
If we get the gold.
Lieutenant Stejer!
Easy now. There we are.
Here we go. There she is.
Detail... forward!
Go!
Colonel Skimmel, I'll never finish your portrait.
This is your twentieth sitting.
Ah, I see you write everything down.
That's a good idea.
M a ny g reat art sts h ave bad m o m ories
- Time is money.
- That's what you Americans think.
But I'm an Austrian.
And for an Austrian, time does not exist.
Oh, no. I don't frown like this.
My face is more joyful.
- Loosen the mouth a trifle.
- You smile so pretty, Colonel.
Packing off a wagonload of grain made you
as happy as sending a shipment of silver dust.
You don't miss very much, friend Ballantine.
As I've told you, Colonel, my mind never rests.
The peons are shouting for vengeance.
M ox co 's a h otbod o f revo u t on.
We shall crush them.
I've already taken the necessary precautions.
We Austrians know exactly what we are doing.
It's all been worked out.
It has been planned, pre-arranged and studied
down to its last detail.
It is inevitable and mathematically perfect.
We Austrians are men of steel.
- Colonel, please.
- We never go back on our word.
Our beloved Emperor Maximilian
is our model and our strength.
There. Much better.
Now
Whoa!
Somebody's moved in on our game.
Take cover! Quickly! We're surrounded!
- Long live liberty!
- Long live free Mexico!
What's going on?
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Adiós amigos
José!
Jesus! Juan! My brothers, my friends!
Amigos, may you be received
by the Lord above!
M ay yo u r m ot h or wve o n h o rsso d u ng!
Two falcons without wings.
I was the greatest high-jumper long ago.
- Shame on you for such lies.
- Let's go get the gold.
Austrian.
Let's go.
Hy-hoo!
Hah!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Wait for me! Give me a hand, Gitano!
Good. We made it, Sabata, eh?
A chest full of gold... to buy arms with.
Buy arms! Buy them to kill Maximilian
and drive the Austrians home.
- Long live Mexico!
- Long live the revolution!
Hey, Escudo.
Doos h o ook ko t h at boca u so

When he was born, there was a great
rainstorm. Your birthday's the 2 September?
You're wrong, amigo. It must be
the 2 of November, All Souls' Day.
Well done, Lieutenant.
Traitors should be shot in the back.
Escudo was in command of the Mexican rebels.
I also saw Sabata with him.
I know him. He's a great shot.
They were headed for Texas.
- Thank you, Lieutenant. You can go.
- Yes, sir.
Writing table.
- We're in very serious trouble.
- They won't get very far.
We have an efficient intelligence service
in Texas.
Hm.
It'll be easier to hide individual sacks of gold
than a clumsy chest like that.
Mu c h oas o r

Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait for me at the San Juan Monastery.
I'm heading in to Kingsville.
The gunrunners will be waiting for me there.
- And so will Ballantine.
- Ballantine? I...
The piano player.
So long.
It's Sabata.
Gentlemen.
Your gun, please.
Gunrunning is a dangerous profession,
isn't that right?
I faint at disagreeable sights.
That's why they wear hoods.
You're an intelligent man, Sabata.
I respect you.
- Why do you join up with scum?
- They are more my kind. You're not.
- Mind if I smoke?
- Mm.
Oh, I forgot. I took the last one myself.
- I can buy some more with your gold.
- I shan't even ask you where it is.
I shall use a little Austrian logic.
In fact, it's discovered already.
When you have gold,
there aren't many places to hide it.
Like the San Juan monastery.
Sorry, I don't belong to that parish.
Even so, we will see you have
a respectable funeral here, in Kingsville,
as will all your Mexican friends.
I'll be back, I assure you.
You'd be smart to relax a little bit,
while we wait for Mr Folgen to return.
No, t h a nks W o do n' t d rin k w t h t h o doad
I drink only with friends...
except for you.
Don't mind my back, gentlemen.
Forget it, Sabata.
It's your home, after all.
Septiembre,
come on in and have a shot.
That won't work with us. Try again.
- Your brother?
- Mm-mm.
The sun is high.
And where is he?
I don't like this place. It's too quiet.
Silent as death.
Only Escudo's footsteps
can be heard on the dry earth.
Everybody else is dead.
Even you seem to be dead.
Ah, go to hell.
And the gold, right out there.
The way things are now,
this is the perfect chance to take it.
- Whose chance?
- How would I know that?
It could even be my chance.
You believed it, didn't you?
Why not mine?
Manuel...
We're surrounded. I'll try to draw them off.
You take care of the cart.
These American guns aren't very good,
are they?
Escudo!
- First we must think of the gold.
- To hell with the gold. Gitano!
Gitano!
Stop! Don't shoot!
G ta no, aam go, m ay yo u r so u bo reco ved
by t h o ord above
Idiot!
You want me to have a heart attack?
- Come on, amigo. Hurry!
- Don't try anything. You're covered.
He tricked us. The Austrian bastards will kill us.
- Get your hands up.
- No, you first.
Amigo
Oh.
They have the gold, huh?
Hey, Blondito, where do you think you're going?
Sabata, I'm glad you showed up.
Tell him I wasn't stealing it.
I just thought one of us
oughta take care of the gold.
Huh?
Gitano, the flamenco of death.
Why did you stop me?
It's only fair. After all, he's the one who gave us
the information about the gold shipment.
Him?
He said he was trying to protect the gold.
No reason w h y s h o u d n' t bo ove h m
No??
No
The gunrunners have been wiped out.
- All we can do is turn the gold over to Ocano.
- We'll take care of that.
I think I'll come along.
I got the rest of my pay coming.
Me too. From him.
Don't worry. Now let's get moving.
Every Austrian in the territory
will be looking for us now.
We'll make our first stop at Eagle Pass
on the Mexican border.
You can thank Sabata
we didn't kill you this time, Blondito.
If your crazy stunt had worked,
they would have taken their revenge on me.
You saved my life.
Fyo u save a m a n' s fo, yo u 're
resbo nss b o fo r h m for t h o rest o f h s days
It makes me feel quite secure.
About the gold.
You and me. Fifty-fifty?
Hey, what's he say?
- He wants us to try a new idea.
- His ideas are nothing.
Mot h m a nd k now ng h t away
ho was no good
You know why?
Because he's got a big mouth.
All OK.
Admit it's a good idea
to hide the gold here.
- Think he's trying to trick us?
- Just don't let him get out of your... rifle range.
Come on!
Ballantine, hi.
It's been so long.
I'm still your favourite model, aren't I?
We... never quite finished that picture, did we?
Sabata! Come on out
with your filthy friends
or we'll kill everyone in the place!
Hey, hold it!
All right, we're leaving.
Sabata.
- What are you doing here?
- I got information for you.
The Austrians are falling back. Our people
just took Las Palomas and Trincheras.
- How do you know?
- I'm Mexican. I know.
How long have you been following me?
Go home.
Go back to Father Mike.
- If you say so, Sabata.
- All right, watch your step.
Be with you in two shakes, huh?
Escudo! Where is the cart?
For the last time, where is the cart?
Manuel, it has been in a good cause and
also may your soul be received by the Lord.
You stand honoured by your deeds,
up to the end.
Yes. And you shall be a model
held in honour among our men.
José, Juan, Jesús.
They shall sing your praises in Mexico
in all the days to come.
If I should forget, let me be thrown
into the deepest pit of hell.
Hey, I almost forgot! Where's Ballantine?
Hyah!
We were just gonna
go look for you fellas. Right?
Take it. Here.
It's yours.
With a load of gold like this,
split three ways,
three happy hombres
living in peace and plenty.
Shall we go?
Hm.
- We stay.
- Ballantine!
Now wo m ay a oave
Whoa!
Hyah!
- But it's for the revolution.
- Oh, sure! The revolution.
All this beautiful gold turned into rifles,
cannons and death.
- I'm not touching it.
- How about trying to buy peace with it?
A load of gold could be divided five ways.
What a contribution to my favourite charity: Me.
No! T's only go ng to t h o revo u t o n

- How do you know that?
- There are ways.
- You're just talking. I don't believe you.
- OK, don't.
Yo u b a nn od t h s n Texas

Mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts,
all weeping and all blaming you.
M o?? W h y b a m o m o??
You want to change
this harmless gold to death and destruction.
Remember your dead friends,
Juan, José, Jesús... Manuel?
No! H oso m o n a re doad

M ox co m u st bo bo ratod!
Long live Mexican liberty!
Long live the revolution!
All right, you win.
- I think it does belong to the people.
- Comes the revolution!
- Ah!
- Yeah!
Ah... Hey, Senor Gold!
"Today, April 26th, I am finally rich!"
Gold! Gold!
Sand.
We risk our lives, let them kill our men.
For what? A box of sand?
God, we must be crazy.
Well...
Easy come... easy go.
Let's look at the Austrians' logic.
A load of gold is shipped from Guadalupe.
A band, not of Mexicans but Austrians dressed
as Mexicans, attacks and steals the gold.
The blame falls on the revolution.

Skimmel. That lousy thief. Pah!
Wo, gont o m on, t's boon f u n,
bu t ca n' t wasto a ny m ore t m o
I want to wish you all the... very best of luck.
Especially you, Escudo. You're gonna have
a hard time convincing the revolutionaries
that you didn't steal the gold.
And you know what'll happen?
You might end up dripping fat into the fire
with an apple up your big mouth
and a spit up your caboose.
Save your bullets for the revolution.
Adiós
!A diós!
I know what's on your mind. I just tell Ocano
the men who stole the gold were those two.
Both of you are cowards.
They trust me. I don't have to lie.
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.
Senor Ocano,
the French at Candelas and Atienza
are getting reinforcements
from Colonel Skimmel's army.
We could attack the fort from the rear,
from Texas, across the bridge at Guadalupe.
The revolution is not going to
cause an international incident.
Gaviota will fall, then we're set.
As soon as those precious new weapons arrive,
we'll strike at Candelas and at Atienza too.
As for Skimmel's Austrians,
to cross the Sierras is impossible.
But they could slip out, north, into Texas
across the only bridge the Austrians control,
this one, at Guadalupe.
Perdito, it's a job for you.
Blow up the Guadalupe bridge.
Kngsville s t h at way
Bu t SSk m m o
I'd like to collect
the money on his portrait.
How much are you asking for it?
A chest full of gold?
You kidding? I'd end up before a firing squad.
- I got a plan.
- Forget it.
No, m oa n it. W o go f fty f ryy
We'll split it in five equal shares.
But how?
Those three?
God knows where they are. Hey!
- Where are you going?
- Guadalupe Bridge.
Forward march!
Skimmel!
Skimmel, we must be quick.
Gaviota's about to fall to the revolutionaries.
Major Metternich! Open up!
Bofore nig h tfa, t h o ont re ga rr son w bo

We shall go to Texas at daybreak in civilian
dress, posing as honest beer merchants.
- The rebels are blocking the way.
- As soon as we cross the bridge, we blow it up.
Hello.
I've brought a present for Colonel Skimmel.
It's Sabata.
Just in case.
Hey!
We just put those in there to bed.
Don't go. We have plans for you too.
Perdito! Leave Sabata alone.
He works for us.
The bridge must be blown up.
It's Ocano's orders.
Well, I admire your loyalty, friend.
Bu t w t h t h o bndgo b ownk u b,

We've just arrived now.
We've new orders from Ocano.
Adiós. And good luck.
Now, m y B ond to
An apple in my mouth?
I'll show you who's on a spit!
Escudo!
You're always butting in.
This time I'm going to punch him in the jaw.
We need him. He knows where the gold is.
Blondito, huh?
Ha!
Four hours till daylight.
No time to waste.
Ca rr y a m oda fonk uck f yo u want,
bu t not m y watc h
It's not because it's yours.
Septiembre likes music.
Soldier, Lieutenant Stejer wishes to see you.
He's expecting you in the orderly room.
Homeward bound at last.
- It's about time, sir.
- Of course it is. In fact, it's way past time.
M g u o! Do n' t wo over oat a ro u nd h ore??
This is a forgotten town.
The commandant doesn't care if we live or die.
You're right. They blame us for all their defeats.
You men, follow me!
There's no other way.
Septiembre.
Who's there?
All gone, eh?
Well, you picked some time
to be without ammunition.
Hey! You clown.
Take the sentry's place. You too, Gitano.
Listen.
It's impossible to cross the camp square.
I'm gonna open the back door to the depot.
From there, there's a short cut to the gold vault.
Phew!
- Hi.
- Good evening, Mr Ballantine.
Let's move. The gold's right next to us.
Ah, you're crazy.
It's not where I would have left it if I'd stolen it.
That's safest.
I'd make a hiding place no one would find.
In the ground, a cemetery.
M aybo ove n in s do t h ore
- Can you read that?
- Beer.
Let's go.
Forgot your book.
Thanks for picking it up for me.
- We made it.
- Halt! Don't move!
Hm.
You're the last person I would have suspected,
my... cultured friend.
Search them.
No, SSorgoant ot h m koob t
You may write your last wishes.
I'll see that they're respected.
I would not have given you the honour
of being executed by a firing squad.
Squad halt. Left face.
Order arms!
Soldier, come here.
Write it down in your book, Blondito.
- I'll make a date with you in hell.
- It's too late.
Squad! Load arms!
Open it.
That's right. I left them.
Come on, idiot.
Ready... aim.
Major Metternich!
'D ko t h s d a ry to bo fo rwa rdod to

Run for it!
Cover me, Septiembre!
One more blast
from that cannon and we're all dead.
I thought so.
Crook.
It's not mine now. I won't need it any more.
The gold...
The gold... Tell the others.
The gold...
The gun.
All right.
What's the proposition?
What makes you think there is one?
If there was no proposition,
you would have killed me by now.
Indeed.
- Order your men to leave.
- They've come too far, Colonel.
They want their gold.
Hmph! Only I know where the gold is.
And you won't get it.
Unless... you make a deal with me.
Sorry. No deal.
I remember our marksmanship contest
in Louisville.
You're the only man
who ever defeated me, Sabata.
Pity you won't have
another chance to beat me.
- Nothing can beat a superior people.
- Who knows?
Sometimes an idea's enough.
Folgen confessed.
The gold is under the ship model.
- Huh?
- Just as you are, reach and pull.
Say, you got a great little brain.
Oh, Septiembre can use this!
Folgen. He wanted me
to open this and get killed.
- Have you any other tricks for me?
- You're wrong.
This is a big mistake.
I did my job. My job.
- It's not my fault.
- Cowardly pig!
Don't kill me.
You can't do it.
You... You can't do it.
Now s u bboso yo u to m o w h ore t h o go d s
Well...
Hey, where's Ballantine?
How could you do it?
He robbed Blondito.
Ah, poor Ballantine.
To die in the moment of our triumph.
So artistic, so generous.
And the most honest of us all.
I weep for him.
May his good soul go to heaven
and be greeted by our Lord above.
Wait. This means there's only four of us.
So we divide his share between us. Eh?
What's this?
M y God
Gold! It's gold!
Septiembre, where were you?
What are you looking for?
Saw the best of us, didn't he?
Come on, let's go.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Go!
!Adiós!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Hey, Blondito! Too bad
you can't get away with it, huh?
Hey, no! You can't do this to me!
- I'm on your side!
- You phoney double-crosser!
Ballantine's share goes to my favourite charity.
