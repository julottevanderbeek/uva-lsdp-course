Sergeant. Hey, Sergeant!
Prisoner no. 15 has got himself a gun.
- How long have you been with us?
- Two days, sir.
Figures.
Well, don't worry about it.
A piece of wood sure ain't
gonna hurt anyone.
That's all it is.
He's spent over a year
carving it.
It wasn't easy, but he
did it well.
Four years in his cell
just drawing that gun.
Practicing all day and night.
I wouldn't wanna be the man
he's after.
Tomorrow he's out.
- Number 15, sir.
- Bring him in.
Well, you're now a free man.
Isn't it a waste that anyone should spend
so many years alone in a jail cell?
I sincerely hope I never see
you back here again.
Oh, I'm sure as hell fed up with
this speech you guys get.
The more that I have to say it,
the more I'm beginning to realize I'm just...
...wasting my breath on a totally useless
cause. You always come back.
No, Bill. We can't let
you have that.
It's the law.
Bill!
No hard feelings.
I don't have any feelings,
except maybe hate.
Bill Kiowa.
A friend sends his regards!
Excellent gun!
I'll have to order
some more.
Welcome back, Bill.
After five years.
It's over.
Five years, but it's over.
Place is kind of dirty.
It's been years since anyone visited.
Do you still have it?
When I got out to your place,
they'd already taken you in.
It's all here,
I saved it for you.
I guess you're looking for Elfego.
I've already heard about him.
I don't suppose there's much good in
my telling you to forget about him.
Just take your money and leave the
state. Well, maybe you're right.
But you won't find it easy, that's a fact.
Things have changed.
I heard, Elfego's now in Nevada.
He deserted his old band...
...and joined a group of Comancheros that've
been running from Federal Troops for years.
He collected rebels, half-beats and deserters
till he had the scum of the earth all together.
A powerful mob.
Mighty powerful!
Tell you the vigilantes
tried to smash that gang and...
...they didn't get anywhere near him.
- And Sheriff Bannister?
- Dead, caught a bullet two years ago.
I'll be looking for...
Four gunmen.
- Four real gunmen.
- Well...
...there's always Morales.
Black Morales.
I don't think you understand.
I'm looking for men who know how to kill.
Listen, Bill, since the end of the war,
There've been some changes.
Most of the fellas never returned.
They died or went elsewhere.
With such poor land,
...who'd want to stay here?
Those who didn't die in the fight
went out west. I just don't know.
Wait a minute! How about Francis
Colt Moran? He's in Abilene.
And Jeff Milton. I think he's
working as a sheriff in Montana.
Bunny Fox, there's one you don't know.
He's young but...
...he's a good fighter.
And O'Banion.
Finished, sir.
Razors make me nervous.
Bravo, my friend!
- Now, where's the bath?
- Ah yes. Certainly, sir.
Good day sir.
I'm looking for a man with a beard.
A big man.
- I don't understand, sir.
- Don't cause trouble!
A big guy.
How large, sir?
Barbers know everything.
- I understand, sir.
- Bravo! So, where is he?
Lower your hand slowly.
Very slowly.
Took you long enough to see my fire.
I'm cold. That tends to
make me nervous.
So don't make any foolish moves.
I don't wanna kill you because
I'm the curious kind.
- Why are you following me?
- Can I move my hand?
Just a little.
Slowly.
This here is $ 5,000.
I've got a job for you.
There's 5,000 more when it's done.
Hungry?
- Where's the sheriff?
- He is upstairs.
Making coffee.
I don't recognize you two.
Who are you?
Yes? How can I help you?
Here are $ 5,000.
And 5,000 more when the job's done.
A lot of money!
It can mean only two things:
Either it's very dangerous
or very bad.
I've got a nice, quiet life here.
- No more gunplay.
- Dangerous, maybe...
...but not so bad.
So you're the man who challenged
Jeffrys in El Paso...
...and took on the Getty band
single-handed.
Let's get going, Kiowa!
You can see he ain't the one.
Alright!
Anyway, it'll be good
to stretch my legs.
I was getting a bit rusty.
You packing that thing?
This "thing" as you call it,
has kept me alive for 20 years.
And I hope it'll let me
know my grandchildren.
Be right with you.
Come on out here.
Raise your right hand.
I hereby appoint you sheriff
by the power invested in me.
I always wanted to be...
To be sheriff.
- Do you really like me, darling?
- Sure, very much.
- I'm glad you do.
- Good.
- Bunny Fox?
- Why?
That there is $ 5,000.
There's 5000 more when the job's done.
- Bye!
- Darling! Don't leave!
- I thought that you liked me.
- I do, and...
...don't you forget it.
- Wanna know what you have to do?
- $ 10,000 don't need...
...any explanation.
What's the trouble?
I'm looking for
Francis Colt Moran.
Gambling...
Gambling and he doesn't like to lose.
And when he loses, he cheats.
When he cheats,
sometimes people get wise.
Then all hell breaks loose,
and when all hell breaks loose...
Sheriff! Just what is this?
- A speech? Is that it?
- He's in there,
...and he'll stay
there for 5 months.
$100.
The trouble is the jail.
It's not safe!
I've told the mayor 100 times now, haven't I?
They don't wanna get a new jail.
I've told them over and over again.
Whole place is falling apart,
but he won't listen.
Nothing to be done when
folks don't listen.
Colt Moran.
Want out?
Why not?
I sure wanna thank you fellas
for springing me loose.
Now would you just hold
still like good boys?
- Let's go after him.
- No, let him go!
I know where to find him.
Aces, full.
Deal'em!
- 50!
- Pass!
- I double.
- I'm out of here.
- Alright.
- It's too much for me.
- I think you better get out of here, M'am.
- Why?
There is electricity
in the atmosphere.
I understand.
Alright now. Take it easy boys.
You'll never make it.
We're too many.
How are you gonna get out
of this one, Moran?
Funny, I was just wondering
the same thing.
You must've seen it all.
How the hell did it begin?
Damned if I know.
It was too sudden.
But I'll tell you this,
I thank god for letting an old man see it.
- Maybe you know these guys?
- Sure I do.
That one here is Jeff Milton.
Next one is Colt Moran.
He is Bunny Fox.
Last one is O'Banion.
Well, I think you're in the clear, men.
You were acting according to your rights.
Come on, Frank.
We better be going.
Well...
What can I say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But that's not why we came.
This here's $ 5,000.
I want you to come with us.
Forward, men!
Elfego can't be far now.
The rain's washed out
most of their tracks.
If you pulled off a job like this and you wanted
to hide out, which direction would you take?
Well I... I guess I'd go...
North, to the hills!
- And you?
- I'd go east.
I guess I'd cross the
border into Utah.
O'Banion, you and me will make for the Cope
River. The rest of you head for Carson City.
We'll meet up again at...
Madigan Post, in three days.
I don't get it. Carson City is out to
the west and the Cope River is south.
Sure.
How do you reckon Elfego's managed
never to get caught all these years?
It's not because he's stronger.
He's got it up here.
You'd go to the North,
and you'd go to the South.
The first place our friend's going to be
is either to the East or the West.
Hey Kiowa! Look at this.
Around 20 horses have crossed here.
No, these are the tracks.
They're the same as the ones back there.
So 20 horses rode this way too.
What makes these our Comancheros?
Those are faint, set close together.
Walking pace.
These are deep, set wide apart.
These are horses galloping.
Those others are just folks out walking.
These are the Comancheros!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go after them.
There's 30 of them and two of us.
We'll go on to Madigan and
wait for the others.
Let's go!
Where is Elfego?
What is it?
We saw two men down by the river.
They were following our tracks.
But they didn't follow us here, though.
They just left off.
- And they rode down toward Madigan's.
- Have you seen them before?
No. One was a very tall man,
very large.
The other one, sort of dark.
Black clothes.
You three, ride to Madigan
and try to find out who they are!
I want a haircut and a shave.
No barbers around here.
- Well, how about a room?
- Got no rooms.
- What about something to eat, then?
- Got nothin' to eat.
I'll be damned.
Out there, the sign says...
- ...restaurant, supplies, rooms...!
- I forgot...
...to take down the sign!
It's all I got.
It'll cost you two dollars.
Whiskey!
Comancheros!
I reckon something in here stinks!
Yeah.
One hell of a big stink.
So that's true then.
I've always heard that fat men...
- ...really smell bad!
- Yeah!
Really bad!
Listen fat pig.
You have spilled my whiskey!
Now fill it!
- Where's Elfego?
- Tell us where.
You will not?
Have a nice trip!
Look who's here?
Bill Kiowa?
That's enough!
That's enough.
Don't kill them.
I need those two alive.
I've got a job for them.
Get out!
Map.
Tomorrow morning at 10, that's where the
coach with the soldiers' pay is going to pass.
You and your lot will attack
from the mountains.
You cut off any retreat.
I attack from the right.
And remember:
I don't want any of these
soldiers left alive.
No one!
Is it clear?
You've done it wrong again, Kiowa.
You always do it wrong.
Tomorrow, we're attacking
a military escort,
...and we're going to
pick up $ 100,000,
...and guess who's fault
it's going to turn out to be.
It's all going to be yours
and your pal's.
Because what they're going to find near
the escort is going to be your tracks.
Then they'll catch you, and
find the money bags on you.
You go to jail, and...
...there'll be nobody around
to bear witness that...
...you weren't the only one who
dreamed up the robbery.
So put your mind to
something, eh, Kiowa?
Jog your memory, does it?
Does it ring a bell?
Remember?
Do you remember?
Maria!
It says here that Jefferson should
be here tomorrow with the money.
I didn't know your father
was so rich.
I didn't either. Not until
I'd already heard he was dead.
James?
- Good to see you. How are you?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought they were looking for you.
- That's right, but don't worry.
I just dropped in to say
goodbye before I left.
Looks like I arrived
just in time for coffee.
Certainly.
There's some on the stove.
Look, James.
You've got enough money.
Why don't you buy a ranch some place
and settle down before it's too late?
No, I'm not like you.
I've got none of that...
...pioneer spirit.
Friends.
Well.
Not bad for an Indian.
Be careful what you say, Moreno.
Maybe you're right after all. I've
always liked the look of her myself.
Dirty Indian squaw!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
I told you, he could
never make you happy.
Get it.
You don't marry Indian girls.
You take them, then kill them!
Kill me too!
Kill me too!
Don't get upset.
I need you alive.
I have plans for you.
- Come with us, Kiowa.
- Sheriff Bannister!
Take him out!
When I get back, I want to find
both of them alive.
Understand?
Still alive, fat pig?
What about yourself?
Hand still sore?
Hold it!
The boss said "no killing".
I won't kill him.
Comancheros!
Looks like we got here just in time.
- Where's the rest of 'em?
- A long way from here.
They'll be back tomorrow but,
we're not going to wait for them.
Why not?
There's two ways to trap game.
Either you follow it,
or you get it to follow you.
The second way's better.
That way you know...
...when and where you're gonna meet.
The Comancheros...
...are Indians and half-breeds.
And they fight like Indians.
I know the Indian ways.
I know their essence and I know
how they fight.
I used to live with them.
My wife was a Kiowa.
That's how I got my name,
Bill Kiowa. Let's go!
They've been dead for a while.
They're cold.
Go on ahead.
Find out which way they're riding.
This time...
...I'll kill you!
- There! They passed through here.
- Five horses.
They're about two hours ahead.
Get after them!
They went this way.
Another broken branch.
We'll spread out.
You can start earning your $ 10,000.
We'll meet back here at nightfall.
Good luck.
Hold it!
We are missing three men!
You'll die hard, bastard.
You two, dismount
and cover that side!
You, you and you, make a wide
circle. Find them and kill them!
I want their heads!
Comancheros!
Get back!
Retreat!
- How did it go?
- I only got two. I'm out of shape.
It'll be dark soon.
This is just the beginning.
Elfego is now wise to our game.
Now it will be more difficult.
We are now face to face.
Good luck!
- That was far away.
- No.
Those bastards know the tricks.
They've muffled their rifles.
It wasn't more than 50 meters.
What are the others doing?
They are massacring us.
We won't stay together.
We will separate.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
I've paid 5 dollars for this shirt,
and wore it only two years.
Moreno.
I wanted to kill him myself.
Gee, I'm terribly sorry.
We are so few now.
We won't give up!
- The bullet didn't hit you?
- Yeah! It hit me alright.
Well.
That's about it.
- Where is Kiowa?
- Gone after Elfego.
Five against one!
Your job's over!
If he kills me,
let him go.
That how you want it?
Wrong again, Bill.
You couldn't be more wrong.
Still a hero, huh?
The generous Kiowa.
You've never been
able to shoot like me.
You haven't got a chance.
Don't talk, shoot!
And shoot to kill!
You've forgotten that you sent
me to jail for five years, James!
What do you think I was
doing all those years?
Day and night.
I was dreaming of this moment, James.
Day and night!
This is for that...
"dirty, Indian squaw"...
...that you killed!
Where are you going?
South.
That's our direction too.
THE END
