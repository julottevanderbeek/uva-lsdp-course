Well, go get him.

MAN:
Yes?
There's a soldier
out here to see you.
Ma'am.
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
Yes, I am.
Fred MacCready's the name.
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
How may I help
you gentlemen?
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
Corporal Smitherman says
you might have a place
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
Where we can put this.
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
Did the, uh, corporal, uh,
give you a message for me?
SOLDIER:
You MacCready?
Hey. Look at that.
Hey. Look at that.
Well, now,
who are they?
Hey. Look at that.
I don't know.
Hey. Look at that.
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
Uh, sorry I had to check,
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
But, uh, you understand
security these days.
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
Is there a safe
we should be taking this to?
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
Best one in the state.
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
But first, you'll have
to sign for it.
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
Sure.
Well, everything seems
to be in order.
MAN:
Maggie, you go on home now.
Now, where you men from?
Camp over that way,
Now, where you men from?
About 20 miles to the east,
near a swamp.
Now, where you men from?
GUARD:
Is that right?
Now, where you men from?
Who's y'all's
lieutenant over there?
Now, where you men from?
We ain't got
a lieutenant right now.
Now, where you men from?
Captain Lewison's around,
though.
Now, where you men from?
GUARD 2:
What are y'all doing here in town?
Oh, we got some business
at the bank.
GUARD 2:
What are y'all doing here in town?
GUARD: Well,
I'm afraid you gonna have to wait a few minutes.
GUARD 2:
What are y'all doing here in town?
GUARD 2:
What are y'all doing here in town?
No.
Can't wait.
Now, you hold it right--
Can't wait.
Can't wait.
Nobody move!
Yep!
Nobody move!
I don't think so.
SAM:
Hey there.
Did you get that teller,
Annabelle?
SAM:
Hey there.
I didn't even see that.
SAM:
Hey there.
The bag's heavy, Joseph?
The bag's heavy, Joseph?
Hell, yes.
The bag's heavy, Joseph?
About time.
About time.
WILLIAM:
Here they come.
Stop right there!
Halt!
Stop right there!
Stop right there!
WILLIAM:
Wait up, little brother.
Shit.
WILLIAM:
Y'all ride on ahead.
Shit.
We got a ways
to that Hollister place.
Shit.
Shit.
How many do you think
will be after us?
Not many at first.
How many do you think
will be after us?
Those'd be the only ones
who could catch us.
How many do you think
will be after us?
You're hit.
Yeah, I know.
You're hit.
I'm fine. It's just
in my shoulder.
You're hit.
I can move it around
all right.
You're hit.
It's not even close
to the bone or anything.
You're hit.
Which way now?
This way.
Which way now?
CLYDE: William,
tell us we ain't lost.
WILLIAM:
We ain't lost, Clyde.
CLYDE: William,
tell us we ain't lost.
We got a couple more miles
of this and then we'll be there.
CLYDE: William,
tell us we ain't lost.
Hey, old man.
You get you
some deserters?
Eight... today.
You get you
some deserters?
You get you
some deserters?
We was looking for
that old Hollister place.
You get you
some deserters?
Hollister.
Never heard of it.
Hollister.
You sure about that?
Hollister.
Should be a large farmhouse
Hollister.
Right past
the creek.
Hollister.
There are no creeks
around here,
Hollister.
Not for miles.
Hollister.
I've seen servants
upon horses,
Hollister.
And princes
upon the earth.
Hollister.
You'd best
be moving on.
Hollister.
We'll keep heading up
this way.
Can't be more
than a couple miles out.
We'll keep heading up
this way.
He ain't got the slightest
notion where we're going.
Yeah, well...
another good plan, huh?
WILLIAM:
Shoot. Crazy old man.
WILLIAM:
Shoot. Crazy old man.
SAM: Do you see a pathway up to the house anywhere?
WILLIAM:
Must've grown over.
SAM: Do you see a pathway up to the house anywhere?
JOSEPH:
Is that it?
SAM: Do you see a pathway up to the house anywhere?
I said
it'd be here.
SAM: Do you see a pathway up to the house anywhere?
ANNABELLE:
Hey.
Come look at this.
ANNABELLE:
Hey.
Looks like a man.
Doesn't look like
no scarecrow.
Do you want me to take
it down, Miss Annabelle?
No.
Do you want me to take
it down, Miss Annabelle?
Just scared me a bit.
Do you want me to take
it down, Miss Annabelle?
Let's move on, shall we?
Do you want me to take
it down, Miss Annabelle?
Good shot, Sam.
WILLIAM:
What the hell is that?
Jesus, Joseph.
WILLIAM:
What the hell is that?
JOSEPH: Somebody shaved the skin right off that boy.
TODD: Don't look like any kind
of mountain cat I ever seen.
JOSEPH: Somebody shaved the skin right off that boy.
JOSEPH: Looks like a wild boar or something.
JOSEPH: Somebody shaved the skin right off that boy.
Let's get
to that house.
Sooner we get inside,
the better.
Let's get
to that house.
Big storm coming in
tonight, William.
WILLIAM: Listen up.
Let's get that gold inside.
And bring your lanterns.
WILLIAM: Listen up.
Let's get that gold inside.
We head out for Mexico
in the morning.
WILLIAM: Listen up.
Let's get that gold inside.
CLYDE: Who'd you say runs this house?
WILLIAM:
No one.
CLYDE: Who'd you say runs this house?
No one.
CLYDE: Who'd you say runs this house?
It belonged to a soldier
I knew once,
CLYDE: Who'd you say runs this house?
But he's dead now, so...
the place is empty, I reckon.
CLYDE: Who'd you say runs this house?
SAM:
Place looks deserted.
No shit.
SAM:
Place looks deserted.
I think we got
that figured out.
SAM:
Place looks deserted.
What the hell?
Just stepped on a bird.
Yeah, come on.
I want to get that bullet out
of you before it gets infected.
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, all right.
Phweet! Dog!
Phweet! Dog!
Oh, hell.
TODD:
What's going on?
It's probably
just some tramps.
Let's look around
and find 'em.
It's probably
just some tramps.
There's only two of 'em.
It's probably
just some tramps.
All right,
but let's all be careful.
It's real.
It's real.
It's real.
Don't chew on
the gold, Joseph.
It's real.
You and Clyde go have
a look upstairs.
It's real.
Todd and I will
check this floor.
It's real.
JOSEPH: I ain't never been in a house this big.
So many rooms.
JOSEPH: I ain't never been in a house this big.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
I guess we're richer
than him now, though.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
We ain't richer than nothing.
Not yet, anyhow.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
How you mean?
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
Don't hurt yourself trying
to think or nothing,
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
But right now
that gold's downstairs.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
That ain't mine
until it's in my pocket.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
That's for true.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
I'm gonna feel a lot easier
when we're in Mexico
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
Holding our shares.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
And if William thinks
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
We're taking the same share
as that nigger,
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
He's got another thing coming.
Whoever built it must've
been pretty damn rich.
You check that room,
and I'll look in this one.
You hear me holler,
you come running, get it?
You check that room,
and I'll look in this one.
You too.
You check that room,
and I'll look in this one.
Todd?
TODD:
I think I heard something.
You can't get it open?
You can't get it open?
No, it's stuck good.
You can't get it open?
Doorknob turning.
You can't get it open?
It ain't locked.
You can't get it open?
Well...
we'll find something
to pry it open.
Let's come back to it.
Anyone here?
Come on.
Come on, get out.
Come on.
Oh!
Why'd you do that?
Hey, I like to breeze
through the trees, corporal.
Why'd you do that?
Anything in here?
No.
Did you find anything?
No.
CLYDE:
Just some clothes.
No.
Looks like a guest room
or something.
No.
The bed's still made.
No.
Let's check the barn
out back next.
Yeah.
Let's check the barn
out back next.
There.
You're done.
Oh!
Goddamn it,
Annabelle!
Oh!
That'll do.
Oh!
Could've told me
you were gonna do that.
Oh!
Stop whining.
Oh!
Ow.
Oh!
What is this place?
TODD:
Slave quarters.
There's a book over here.
WILLIAM: Any of this mean anything to you?
TODD: They're spells...
for raising the dead.
WILLIAM: Any of this mean anything to you?
How much you figure
our share to be,
looking at that gold?
How much you figure
our share to be,
Less than it should.
How much you figure
our share to be,
Sure would be easier
if we was to divide it by two,
How much you figure
our share to be,
instead of...
How much you figure
our share to be,
We got...
How much you figure
our share to be,
That kid already got
a bullet in him.
How much you figure
our share to be,
I reckon you could take care
of our lady friend.
How much you figure
our share to be,
WILLIAM:
You find anything in here?
How much you figure
our share to be,
CLYDE:
No. It's empty.
How much you figure
our share to be,
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
It could wash away
any tracks we left.
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
Uh-uh.
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
Ground'll be muddy tomorrow.
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
Leave tracks
that'll last for days.
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
You hear me
ask your opinion, boy?
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
'Cause I didn't.
Might not be a bad time
for a storm.
Ain't no boys in here,
speculator.
I wouldn't speculate on you.
Ain't no boys in here,
speculator.
I wouldn't have
no use for you, none at all.
Ain't no boys in here,
speculator.
I don't see any pine trees
for you to hide behind
up in here.
I don't see any pine trees
Oh, boy, I'll knock those eyes
straight in your head.
I don't see any pine trees
Shut up,
the both of you.
I don't see any pine trees
Yeah, I wonder how
they got up in there.
There ain't no ladder.
There ain't no ladder.
CLYDE: This place is going to turn me into a little girl.
There ain't no ladder.
Well, if there was anyone here,
they're long gone by now.
There ain't no ladder.
Come on.
There ain't no ladder.
JOSEPH:
Ante up over there.
That's it.
JOSEPH:
Ante up over there.
I swear...
JOSEPH:
Ante up over there.
Five...
JOSEPH:
Ante up over there.
Hit a winner.
Mmm...
Hit a winner.
It's me, isn't it?
Hit a winner.
How much you got?
And don't lie.
Two.
Two.
Two.
Two and one,
that's it.
You holdin'?
Two and one,
that's it.
They said there were
some beds upstairs.
Two and one,
that's it.
Want to go lie down
for a while?
Damn.
Come on,
what is it now?
JOSEPH:
Three.
Another three.
JOSEPH:
Three.
My bet.
Joseph, come on,
now, boy.
JOSEPH:
I got a...
Joseph, come on,
now, boy.
I'll go five.
Joseph, come on,
now, boy.
ANNABELLE:
Do you remember the hospital
where we first met?
First time we talked
after you woke up?
You, me,
Jeffy Hollister...
when he told us
about this place.
Did he ever say anything
about the folks
that he inherited it from?
Did he ever say anything
Yeah, some great-uncle
or something.
Had he ever been out here?
I don't think he had.
Carried around
all those maps.
Mmm.
Carried around
all those maps.
It was awful
watching him go.
He called me "Belle."
I wanted you
the first time I saw you.
Annabelle...
I think I killed a kid
in town today.
Did you see it?
I'm out. I'm done.
Wise decision, nance.
I'm out. I'm done.
Wiser than
our friend here,
I'm out. I'm done.
Who's looking to lose
his share of the gold
I'm out. I'm done.
Afore he gets to count it.
I'm out. I'm done.
SAM:
You know, Clyde,
I'm out. I'm done.
You'd be a lot better
at bluffing
I'm out. I'm done.
If you played it
down a bit.
I'm out. I'm done.
See your three.
I'm up five.
I'm up five.
JOSEPH: Hell,
I best to get these horses in...
before that storm hits.
JOSEPH: Hell,
I best to get these horses in...
You do that.
JOSEPH: Hell,
I best to get these horses in...
JOSEPH:
It's been a rough day,
hasn't it, boys?
Nothing to worry about,
now you in here.
Storm ain't gonna
hurt you none.
Nothing to worry about,
now you in here.
You did good today,
Passion.
I'm gonna get you
all fed and watered now.
I guess you don't need this.
I do.
Be right back.
Hmm.
BOY :
Please, help me!
Get me out of here!
Is somebody down there?
BOY:
Please, mister, hurry!
Is somebody down there?
Let me outta here!
Can't see you.
Let me outta here!
My daddy threw me
in here!
Let me outta here!
Oh, hell!
Let me outta here!
My-- My Lord!
I'm gonna throw
a bucket down to you.
My-- My Lord!
Hurry!
Damn!
My-- My Lord!
Hurry! I'm cold!
Just grab hold on it.
Hurry! I'm cold!
I'm gonna pull you up
out of there.
Hurry! I'm cold!
Hurry!
Hurry! I'm cold!
You got it?
All right.
All right, grab hold,
both hands.
Uh-huh.
All right, grab hold,
both hands.
Come on.
All right, grab hold,
both hands.
Well, damn!
All right, grab hold,
both hands.
All right, grab hold,
both hands.
Damn! What...?
You okay there, Sam?
Mmm...
I don't know.
Mmm...
This thing's
itching me.
Mmm...
Means it's healing.
Mmm...
Yeah.
I guess so.
Yeah.
SAM: How long do you think Joseph's been gone?
Yeah.
MAN :
There's more Injuns coming.
MAN :
There's more Injuns coming.
Belle...
ANNABELLE: I'll be back for you, Jeffy.
Belle...
Isn't she beautiful?
I think she's the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Soon as I heal up
and get out of here,
we're going to get married.
Soon as I heal up
and get out of here,
She told me so.
JEFFY :
Bastard...
Bastard!
JEFFY :
Bastard...
What is it?
Joseph's gone.
What is it?
What do you mean,
he's gone?
He's gone. He disappeared.
What do you mean,
he's gone?
He went to take
the horses to the barn,
What do you mean,
he's gone?
And he hasn't come back yet.
What do you mean,
he's gone?
We're all out
looking for him.
What do you mean,
he's gone?
I'll be right down.
Todd and Clyde are out back.
Are you coming?
Yeah, I'll be along
in a minute.
Yeah, I'll be along
in a minute.
Yeah, I'll be along
in a minute.
Dog!
Joseph?
BOY:
You seen him?
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
I went out after him, but...
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
I must've gotten turned
around in there or something.
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
Well, you couldn't find
your way out there in daylight,
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
Much less at night
with a storm coming.
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
Yeah.
Joseph!
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
He'll either come back
or he won't.
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
Let's all keep
our pistols handy.
No. I thought I heard Dog
out in the cornfield.
I got to take care
of something.
I'll be around
in a minute.
I got to take care
of something.
WILLIAM: We shouldn't leave
the gold unattended again.
We've been lucky so far,
especially
with those two around.
Do you think they're
playing at something serious?
Things are different now.
From now on,
one of us three
stays with the gold
at all times,
From now on,
one of us three
no matter what,
From now on,
one of us three
at least until we figure out
what's going on here.
From now on,
one of us three
Got that?
Yeah.
From now on,
one of us three
All right.
From now on,
one of us three
Dog?
Dog?
Shh!
Dog?
Hey. Hey. Hey, now.
BOY :
BOY :
WILLIAM:
Stay with the gold.
What is it?
There was a boy
in here.
What is it?
A boy?
What is it?
He ran out.
What is it?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
It just scared me, that's all.
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
Maybe it was the light.
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
Was this a young kid?
Yeah, he was young.
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
He was small.
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
If there was a boy here,
Sam will find him.
Yeah, I'm fine. It just--
We're the only ones
on this floor.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
SAM:
I don't see how.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
He didn't go downstairs.
We would've passed him.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
Yeah.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
You sure you weren't dreaming?
He was here!
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
He could've gone out
another way.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
If there was a boy here--
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
It wasn't a dream, William.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
Sam?
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
Sam? Sam.
WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window?
On your feet.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You all right?
I just got queasy after running
up all those goddamn stairs.
You all right?
Okay, you need to lie down
and get some rest.
You all right?
No, I'm all right.
Just give me a minute.
You all right?
Lie down.
You all right?
Come on.
You all right?
Annabelle...
I believe you
about the boy.
Get some rest.
I believe you
about the boy.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
No, you just said
I had a bad dream.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
I heard you
the first time.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
Ah, Christ, Annabelle.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
Sam's wound's infected.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
He's not gonna be
in any condition
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
To ride if it gets much worse.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
All right, fine.
You got any suggestions?
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
It's just that...
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
There's something wrong
with this place.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
There was something awful
about that boy upstairs.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
Why can't
we just leave now?
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
Well, there's no chance of us
going anywhere tonight,
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
Not in this.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
And we can't
just leave Joseph here,
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
He could just be
passed out somewhere.
I didn't say that
I don't believe you.
What've you been doing?
You see Joseph come by?
Could've sworn I saw him
moving around in there.
WILLIAM:
You sure it was him?
Could've sworn I saw him
moving around in there.
I saw a head and shoulders
moving through the rows, but...
Could've sworn I saw him
moving around in there.
WILLIAM:
What?
Could've sworn I saw him
moving around in there.
Then I didn't
see it no more.
It's either him
or something pretty big.
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
My parents
used to lie together in this bed.
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
This is where my mother was
when the consumption took her.
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
I will fear no evil...
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
Our Father,
thou art in heaven...
I had to do it.
I put the children...
where they'll never be found...
I put the children...
by anyone.
I put the children...
I tried to bring my wife back,
but they tricked me.
I put the children...
They changed
my children into demons.
I put the children...
Who are you?
Where is my wife?
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Clyde here says he saw
Joseph and Dog.
Where is she?!
At least it was
some kind of animal.
Where is she?!
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
We'll stand watch
over it. Why?
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
I say we divide
the gold up now,
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
So we're each carrying
our own shares.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Seems safer.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
And I said...
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
We divide the gold up
when we get to Mexico,
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Not before.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Doesn't make
any sense, William.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Joseph's missing,
we don't know where.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Way it is,
Clyde.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Part of this gold is mine.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
And you'll get it...
when we're out of the country.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
It's the way
I say it is.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
That's final.
We planning on keeping
this gold out all night?
Ah, doesn't make
any difference, I guess.
I'm gonna
go get some rest.
You do that.
I'm gonna
go get some rest.
Sam!
Sam!
Who's there?
How'd you get in here?
How'd you get in here?
Hey.
Listen, kid...
you need to tell me
if there's someone else
in this house.
You need to tell me
Did something happen?
How'd you get
in here?
Oh, please.
Please help me.
How'd you get
in here?
Please let me go!
How'd you get
in here?
I didn't
do nothing.
How'd you get
in here?
I won't tell nobody
about the others.
How'd you get
in here?
The others?
You a runaway?
How'd you get

You stay here with Annabelle,

Where's William?
Where's the gold?
Will's taking care of it.
What's that?
A door.
Page from that book.
A door.
What are you
talking about?
A door.
It's no door
that you would understand.
A door.
It's for sacrifice.
First, all the slaves...
all the cheap ones and
the females past their prime.
First, all the slaves...
You have to follow
certain rituals to be heard.
First, all the slaves...
Most think of them
as spirits
First, all the slaves...
and ghosts.
First, all the slaves...
But they have
always been here.
First, all the slaves...
They exist
in a world around our own.
First, all the slaves...
Sam--
First, all the slaves...
They want to change
what is in this world.
First, all the slaves...
They wanna... torment us.
First, all the slaves...
I don't understand.
Annabelle...
I don't understand.
This really hurts.
I don't understand.
I think something's wrong.
All right, let me--
Let me look at it.
Ah!
What is that?
I don't know.
Sam, we have
to get you to a doctor.
I don't know.
You have
some sort of an infection.
I don't know.
I may be able to get you
something for the pain.
I don't know.
No.
I don't know.
It don't hurt
no more, Belle.
What?
What did you just call me?
What?
I want to show you something.
Here. Come on.
Come on.
Here. Come on.
Don't you want to see
what they did to me?
Here. Come on.
You were shot, Sam.
I was there, remember?
Here. Come on.
No! Preacher said
shooting's too good for me.
Here. Come on.
They just left me out there
to rot for what I did.
Here. Come on.
Sam, what're you talking about?
Here. Come on.
Sam?
Sam...
Sam...
I can't see--
Stop calling me that!
I can't see--

Where did you put
the bodies?

Where are
your children?
Where they belong!
Where are
your children?
Hoist him up there!
Where are
your children?
I've opened the door.
Where are
your children?
They're here forever!
Where are
your children?
PREACHER:
Fine.
Where are
your children?
We'll see you get
a taste of hell in this world
Where are
your children?
Before you pass on
to the next.
Where are
your children?
Where are
your children?
You'll see!
Just wait!

You have no idea.
Todd! Joseph!
Where the hell
are you, goddamn it?
Todd! Joseph!
Todd! Joseph!
What is it?
I saw everything.
What exactly
did you see?
I saw everything.
What's wrong with Sam?
I don't know.
Sam?
He's dead.
What the hell
happened here?!
I don't know.
What, was it his wound?
What the hell
happened here?!
No, it's this place!
What the hell
happened here?!
This place
did something to him!
What the hell
happened here?!
What do you mean,
"this place"?
Why would Jeffy Hollister
send us here?
What do you mean,
"this place"?
What do you know
about this farm?
What do you mean,
"this place"?
What are you
talking about?
What do you mean,
"this place"?
It was a trap, William!
What do you mean,
"this place"?
TODD: The farmer that lived here,
he sacrificed
What do you mean,
"this place"?
His slaves...
What do you mean,
"this place"?
In some sort of ritual...
to bring his wife back.
In some sort of ritual...
He killed them because
they turned into beasts...
in some sort of ritual...
demons.
In some sort of ritual...
I saw it.
In some sort of ritual...
We need to get outta here,
William.
Sam's dead, Todd.
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
We need to get as far away
from this farm as we can.
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
We're not leaving here
without the gold.
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
The gold?
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
Yeah.
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
The gold, remember?
WILLIAM:
Where the hell have you been?
We left you here
watching it.
ANNABELLE:
Two against one, Todd.
What are you
thinking about?
ANNABELLE:
Two against one, Todd.
TODD: I'll kill him, Miss Annabelle.
You ain't that quick.
Maybe.
TODD: I'll kill him, Miss Annabelle.
You ain't that quick.
He won't be
lonely long if you do.
TODD: I'll kill him, Miss Annabelle.
You ain't that quick.
Should've left
when I had the chance.
You watch yourself.
Should've left
when I had the chance.
I've ridden
with you a long time.
Should've left
when I had the chance.
I saved your life
more times than I can count!
Should've left
when I had the chance.
That don't make it yours.
Should've left
when I had the chance.
Put the gun down,
Todd.
Should've left
when I had the chance.
WILLIAM:
You had no part in this?
That gold
don't mean nothing now.
It's gone.
No.
We find Joseph and Clyde,
and we find that gold.
No.
No.
Did you hear that?
What?
Now it's gone.
Todd.
Now it's gone.
Forget about
Joseph and Clyde.
Now it's gone.
Your brother's dead.
Now it's gone.
Let's just get on our horses
Now it's gone.
And get the hell
outta here, right now!
Now it's gone.
I don't care what you decide.
It don't matter what you do.
WILLIAM:
Todd!
Wait just a goddamn minute!
ANNABELLE: Look at that.
What could've done this?
Looks like
I'm walking!
What the hell could have done
this to the horses, William?!
Looks like
I'm walking!
Looks like
I'm walking!
WOMAN:

WOMAN:
WOMAN:
Hear what?
WOMAN:

TODD :
I can't trust my eyes anymore.
There are worse things
than dying, you know.
I'm not leaving here
without that gold!
I am.
Annabelle, if you want to leave,
you go with Todd.
I'm staying here.
Annabelle, if you want to leave,
you go with Todd.
Sam's not dead.
He walked outta here.
Sam's not dead.
It didn't look like
he was walking anywhere.
Well, he's not here now!
It didn't look like
he was walking anywhere.
He was dead, William!
It didn't look like
he was walking anywhere.
Whatever took his body
took it to keep us here.
It didn't look like
he was walking anywhere.
We have
to find him.
William--
Listen to me!
William--
Listen to me!
What is it?
