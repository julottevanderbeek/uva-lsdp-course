What wouId you Iike?
TequiIa. The makings.
sir.
My name's Wade. Jess Wade.
Mean anything to you?
No,
Nobody came here today asking for me?
No,
Nobody asked for Jess Wade?
Not a man asked for nobody.
Not a man. A woman.
A beautifuI, no-good woman.
About so high.
Maybe beautifuI to me, not to you.
I got a message.
Taken me a day and a haIf
to ride in here and meet her.
I apoIogize, Jess.
If I'd sent a message that I wanted
to see you, you wouIdn't have showed up.
So, I sent a message that
Miss Tracey Winters had come down here.
And here you are.
In any case, we're aII gIad to see you.
Don't move, Jess.
AII right.
AII of you know what I'm going to do.
What are you gonna do, Jess?
Leave me again?
You aII know I'm gonna try for that door.
Anybody makes a move to stop me,
one of you never makes another move.
Understand? Maybe two of you.
Which two? Think it over.
Just remember the first face I see gets it.
Where you going? Mr. ''Go Straight'' Wade.
Hey, Jess.
Now, you shouId have never Ieft me, Jess.
We missed you. CouIdn't you teII?
I figured.
AII right, BiIIy, see what he's got on him.
I'd say he's got on him boots, pants,
some kind of shirt,
some kind of hat.
That's what I'd say he's got on him, Vince.
Take out his waIIet, idiot!
What kind of brother are you?
In front of him !
Now, do what I teII you!
Do your own work, Vince.
Don't send an idiot to do it for you.
Look, you've been around us
Iong enough to know
that when I badmouth my brother
I don't want to hear an echo.
Now, Iet him go!
Now, give me your gun beIt.
AII right, BiIIy.
-How much?
-Six doIIars.
AII right, BiIIy.
TeII the man we're sorry
we messed up his pIace.
Now get on your horse, Jess.
Get on your horse!
AII right, Iet's move out.
How do you Iike the view, Jess?
It's a Iong way down.
But you're not going to drop me.
What makes you think I won't, oId friend?
You couId have kiIIed me
back in that saIoon.
AII right, Iet's keep movin'.
Gabe, it's aII right. It's Vince.
Six doIIars. Six Iousy doIIars.
You Ieft me for that skinny IittIe vein.
I toId you there was no goId in it.
It was skinny. I toId you it was skinny.
You toId me.
Nobody Ieaves me.
If I Iive to be 100, I'II never get over it.
Somebody Ieft me. You.
You know what, Jess?
AII because of Miss Tracey Winters.
My girI, Jess.
You Ieft me because of my girI.
My girI feII for you and you thought
you couId turn honest for her.
WeII, you and Tracey were crazy, Jess.
Worse than that, you were bIind stupid.
You got me here for a reason.
Now, what is it?
You worked that vein for a year
just to find out how skinny it was.
You Ieft me, Jess. You couId've had that.
Let him take a Iook.
Let him see what he missed.
VINCE: Doesn't Iook Iike much, does it?
But you'd have been rich, Jess.
Richer than you ever dreamed of
the rest of your Iife.
There was never any future
with you, Vince.
Vince.
The soIdiers just might stumbIe over
the entrance of this ravine.
Now, Iet's get going.
Don't you try to give my brother orders.
VINCE: Whoa, Heff.
He's a worrier, BiIIy Roy.
Good to have a worrier aIong.
Show him. Show Jess what he missed.
And what we got.
MOD Y: Maybe we ought to
make him guess.
AII right, Gunner, Mody,
take the canvas off.
SoIid goId over bronze, Jess.
Maybe over $100,000 worth.
More siIver than a man's apt
to see in a Iifetime.
And you're gonna meIt it down.
MeIt it down?
Jess, boy, you've been away
from me too Iong.
You've forgotten I never think short,
aIways Iong.
What's Iong this time?
WeII, now, this gun isn't just
worth the goId and siIver on it.
It's what they caII the Victory Gun, Jess.
It fired the Iast shot against MaximiIian.
AII Mexico was freed.
It's a shrine, Jess.
Highest bidder.
You see what you gave me up for?
Maybe your share of over $100,000.
How far are the  behind you?
Not me, Jess. You.
They're after you.
I just wanted to make sure you'd be
in the neighborhood.
Don't you want to know why
they're after you?
You remember Norm, Jess?
He got shot in the neck whiIe
we was gettin' away.
Norm never made it.
We buried him out there somewhere.
I Iet it get out that that wasn't Norm at aII.
Mody.
Look at this, Jess.
Look at the posters they got out
on both sides of the border.
''Wanted. $10,000 reward. Jess Wade.''
''American. ''. Dark hair.
Fair compIexion.''
That fits, doesn't it, oId friend?
''The Mexican government is prepared
to pay 10,000 American doIIars
''for the apprehension of Jess Wade,
''who was the onIy identifiabIe member
of the fouI perpetrators
''who stoIe the Victory Gun
from the ChapuItepec PaIace,
''JuIy 8, Iast.''
Now Iisten to this. This is the best part.
''Wade sustained a neck wound
''as a resuIt of the gunfire
from the guards on duty.
''This man can be identified
by the severe wound on his neck.''
So, that's it.
AII right, boys.
A severe wound across his neck.
You see who they're Iookin' for, Jess? You.
AII right, Iet him up.
That's one man who's not gonna make
it to his feet, Iet aIone go anywhere.
-AII right, bring his saddIe.
-MAN: Yo!
How do you suppose he did that?
Who says he couId keep on
managing that?
One thing, Jess, you haven't Iost
any of your sand.
AII right, that's enough.
Make him comfortabIe.
Is that better, Jess?
AII right, Iet's get ready to move out.
-Gabe?
-Yeah.
-Take Jess' horse with you.
-Yes, sir.
WeII, now, that's a Iot more Iike it.
You're as good as new, Jess,
except for your neck.
You won't be needin'
my tender care anymore.
You're free to go, Jess.
Anywhere where the Mexican Iaw
or the Mexican  can't find you.
Or any pIace north,
where the American Iaw
or the American cavaIry
can't run you down.
You're a famous man, Jess.
Don't ever forget it.
I won't.
BILLY ROY: Stop! Stop! Stop!
BiIIy Roy, what the heII
is the matter with you?
I quit! This is as far as I go!
Get going. Keep at it.
No, no, no. We settIe here!
No, we'II settIe up there!
It's about a miIe or so from Rio Seco.
Now you're taIkin'!
I get a night on the town.
Keep at it!
Let's get us up there on them rocks!
Lordy, Lordy, can't say
I'm gonna miss that.
AII right, Iet's move out.
Hi, Dan.
Jess.
Jess, I'm so gIad to see you.
-Or am I?
-I hoped you'd be.
Not if what I've read is true.
What've you read, Dan?
-Coffee?
-Is it as bad as ever?
-It's worse.
-Good.
As I remember, one of your punishments,
aIong with your Iectures,
was drinkin' your coffee.
Hey, you're wrong, Dan.
It's not worse, it's onIy as bad.
So be it. Sit down.
Do you mind Ioosening
that dust catcher around your neck?
I mind.
-Look, do you want to hear what I've read?
-You don't have to read it, Dan.
You barreIed around
when I toId you not to.
You rode with Vince Hackett
when I toId you not to.
You've done everything I toId you not to.
But one thing you never did was Iie.
Now, is this true?
No.
-That thing on your neck?
-It was put there.
Vince Hackett. WeII, so much for that.
You know, I showed one to her.
I didn't quite beIieve it myseIf
and I wanted to see if she beIieved it.
Did she?
WeII, you've run a rough course, Jess.
I think she thinks maybe yes.
WeII, the important thing is
you didn't beIieve it.
No, Jess.
The important thing to you isn't me.
That's the way it goes, Dan.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
mention I was here. To anybody.
It's been over a year.
I wondered how Iong it wouId be before
you'd come back for it.
Where is it?
It's right here in front of you.
It's aIways been here
right where you Ieft it.
Like me.
After a year, I guess
I aImost Iook new to you.
You're back with Vince Hackett,
aren't you?
-TeII me the truth, Jess.
-It's got to do with Vince.
It's got a Iot to do with him.
I thought you were going to try.
I reaIIy did.
But, now you're in the worst troubIe
you've ever been in.
The poster Dan Ramsey showed you?
And you beIieve it?
SteaIing a Mexican nationaI shrine.
Sounds Iike your idea.
Vince couIdn't think it up.
That Victory Gun shouId be worth
a fortune to any of those bandits
down there trying to take over
the government.
You don't beIieve I sweated it out
by myseIf for a year?
I beIieve it's Vince again.
It's Vince, but not again.
You're worse than he ever was.
At Ieast he never made himseIf out to be
anything but a crook and a kiIIer.
Here it is. And here's what goes with it.
The poster said,
''Severe wound across the neck.''
-You need something on that.
-It can wait.
For what?
I figure after three days of fighting
that wagon through the desert
and that storm, BiIIy Roy'II be ready
to head for the nearest Iiquor
and the nearest women.
And the nearest of both are here.
My pIace?
Jess, you Ioved me once, and I Ioved you.
PIease don't use that to bring harm here.
Just go about your normaI business.
Nothing's gonna happen if you do as I say.
Trust me.
Trust you?
Just go down your usuaI way
from the baIcony.
I think you're right
about nothing happening.
Because if anything does happen,
I'II make sure the whoIe town
sees those wanted posters on you,
and then never mind
your oId friend Sheriff Ramsey.
NormaI business. Forget I'm here.
Taco.
Whoa, girIie.
Just what I've been Iookin' for.
OnIy you're going the wrong way.
You shouIdn't be going out.
You shouId be going in with me.
You go on in. I'II be back in a minute.
Oh, girIie.
My name is Marcie.
WeII, you come back.
You be good to me.
You may get your picture on my hoIster.
Who's that, somebody you shot?
I don't shoot them, Marcie, girIie.
I bring 'em back to Iife.
I'II be back in a minute.
Don't you go away, now.
You Iost your chance at me, Marcie, girIie.
I take what's warm and cIose.
Howdy.
Scared, Harvey?
Don't be. It's just me.
A whoIe bottIe of your reguIar stock.
No troubIe, Harvey. Just a visit.
Me, myseIf, aIone. Understand?
I forget. I just forget.
I forget every girI I ever saw
when I see you, Miss Tracey.
You aIso forget none of the Hackett bunch
is aIIowed in here?
You are without a doubt
the most beautifuI woman
I ever wasn't aIIowed to Iook at,
but I mean to make up for that by...
AII right, BiIIy Roy. Out.
AII these other girIs go for kindIing.
You're the best.
You can forget Jess Wade.
He's not up to you.
You can even forget my brother, Vince.
I mean to make you forget both of them.
BiIIy Roy. Stay put, everybody.
How am I supposed to recognize
her when somebody cut out her face?
Ease out, BiIIy Roy. No troubIe.
Just ease away from the bar,
and you and I go outside.
What you got in mind, Jess?
Have a drink with me
and aII these pretty girIs.
Outside.
WeII, maybe I got something to say
about who's going out and who's not!
Don't be stupid, BiIIy Roy.
You and I just go for a waIk.
TaIk things over.
How come you didn't say ''idiot''
instead of ''stupid''?
I know why.
My brother's the onIy man aIive
can caII me an idiot.
Somebody just came in, didn't they?
Somebody against me?
'Cause I'm a Hackett?
Listen, Jess,
you shouIdn't be caIIin' me out.
You're part of us.
Besides, I know better
than to go against you.
Anybody but my brother Vince
wouId be crazy to go against you.
He's crazy, isn't he?
AII you gotta do is turn around
and waIk outside.
I waIk out with you. No troubIe.
I'm gonna do just what you said.
You said turn around?
Look, I got my hands up.
You said waIk out? AII right, I'II waIk out.
Can't do a thing about it, can you, Jess?
Shooting somebody in the back
just ain't your styIe.
Start waIking, BiIIy Roy.
Jess, I'II handIe this.
AII right, Mr. Big Jess Wade.
What do you do now?
You gonna foIIow Tracey and me
down the street for a nice quiet taIk?
Drop that gun, Mr. Hackett.
Now, you Iet Miss Tracey go
and you come with me.
We're getting out!
Harvey, take him home to his wife.
Get Opie Keetch over there, quick.
You're Jess Wade.
Used to ride with Vince Hackett's bunch.
Don't teII them a thing, Jess.
Let Vince do the answering for you.
Where are you going?
Where you gentIemen shouId be going.
Now, you Iisten to me, Dan Ramsey.
There's another one in there
gotta come out,
but I ain't gonna try it,
unIess you Ioad up with this whiskey.
Another shock Iike you just had
is gonna kiII you.
JESS: Wait a minute, Opie.
You don't drink any better
than you Iecture, Dan.
Now, it's my turn to Iecture you.
I drink enough of your Iousy coffee.
You aIways toId me if I was ever cIean,
you'd have a drink of whiskey with me.
Give me that, Opie.
I'm cIean, Dan. You know that.
It's time for that drink.
Now, come on.
Were my Iectures that bad?
-Worse.
-WeII, if you two are through jawing...
Wait, Opie.
I spent 1 years getting
this pIace safe to Iive in. You know that.
You got to keep it that way for me,
Jess, tiII I get back on my feet.
-I'm no Iawman, Dan.
-You're gonna be.
I think I know who you're waiting for.
HoId up your right hand.
HoId up your right hand.
I hereby swear you in as my deputy.
A badge, Sara, in the top drawer,
and he'II need a key to the gun rack.
Thanks, Jess. AII right, Opie, get digging.
If a woman's eyes are bIue,
she'II be sweet and true to you.
But if a woman's eyes are green,
she'II turn hot or coId or mean.
Hey, Mr. Wade.
Did you know Tracey's eyes are brown?
How's Sheriff Ramsey?
No worse off than I'd be if I took
two .45 sIugs in the chest.
If Sheriff Ramsey dies,
we hang him two minutes Iater.
You hear that, Vince?
They're fixing to hang your IittIe brother!
They don't know what you're gonna do,
do they, Vince?
Mr. JosIyn.
Mr. Carter.
Mr. SeIby. Mr. TiIford.
You got a generaI store,
and you got a bank.
You got a hoteI,
and you got a Iivery stabIe.
And you got your rifIes. Now protect them.
Anything... Anything happens to me,
Vince'II pick you and this town to pieces
Iike a hawk pIucks a chicken!
He'II be a Iot quieter after
the sweIIing goes down.
-The sweIIing from what?
-That bump on your head.
I got no bump on my head.
You have now.
You gentIemen get some sIeep.
I want to see you in this office at sunup.
And bring those rifIes.
Now, what gives you
the right to order us around?
This.
You want that cannon
for yourseIf awfuI bad, don't you?
WeII, you'd better watch out.
You can't use me for bait!
Do you go to sIeep
or do I put you to sIeep?
Mody, get off your butt
and get down here!
AII right, which of you
Iet the coaIs die out?
You had the Iast watch.
AII right. AII right!
Now, I don't mind the coffee going coId.
The thing is this.
Now, why the heII didn't you teII me
my brother didn't come back Iast night?
I didn't want to wake you.
I kept thinking to the Iast second
he'd be back.
Gunner, saddIe up!
You and I are gonna take a ride.
Vince, maybe the best thing
is to forget him.
We gotta move on.
-Forget BiIIy Roy?
-He's nothing but troubIe, Vince.
He'II get us aII caught. Let's move.
I'm sorry, Heff.
Gabe. BiIIy Roy's my fauIt.
Mody, one-haIf hour from now,
I want you to sidIe down that hiII.
Get just cIose enough
to throw a scare into somebody.
-Thirty minutes on the dot.
-On the dot!
They don't seem to be breaking their taiIs.
Not much reason to.
ProbabIy got 0 patroIs out Iike
that, Iooking inch by inch.
What are you gonna do?
WeII, get BiIIy Roy out
of Miss Tracey's saIoon, sober him up,
come back up here,
and watch which way they go.
I teII you, Jess Wade.
Even though you was with them I never
reaIIy beIieved you was with them.
I was with them.
WeII, that's gonna heaI aII right, but you're
gonna be carrying a pretty fancy scar.
You mind Iettin' me know if the man
who shot you is stiII aIive?
TeII me the truth.
What chance has Dan Ramsey got?
WeII, you saw him with me
0 minutes ago.
He wasn't breathing too good,
but I got a feeIing Dan Ramsey'II be
breathing fine any day now.
-Marcie, take this for me, pIease.
-AII right.
Leaving your prisoner unguarded?
About finished, Opie?
You're making it very easy
for Vince Hackett to come in.
What wouId you suggest I do?
I'd have men up on the roofs.
It's not a bad idea.
I shouId have thought of it.
Open up.
It's aII adding up, Mr. Jess Wade.
On your feet.
CARTER: Nice day, Miss Tracey.
Morning, Miss Tracey.
Morning, Mr. TiIford.
SELBY: Nice day, Miss Tracey.
Yes, indeed, Mr. SeIby.
Tracey.
Good to see you again, Tracey.
Wish you couId stiII say that.
What are you doing here, Vince?
I didn't think it was possibIe for you
to get prettier.
Somehow you managed it.
BiIIy Roy Iearned a Iot from you.
That's the way he started out Iast night.
Ended up cIaiming he couId
make me forget Jess Wade and you,
aII in one night.
BiIIy Roy's my fauIt. I Iive with it.
I Iooked around outside. Didn't see
any wanted posters on Jess Wade.
Guess the Sheriff didn't figure there
was any hurry in getting them put up.
I saw one of them.
Was there a hurry?
No. No.
There are other posters, other towns,
beIow and above the border.
You and Jess have that cannon?
He trying to do you out of it,
or you trying to do him?
When was the Iast time
you saw Jess Wade?
What difference does that make?
A Iot. AIways did, aIways wiII.
WeII, where's BiIIy Roy?
He sIeeping it off up in your room?
He'd never be aIIowed in my room.
AII right. Where?
In jaiI.
What's the reason this time?
He shot Dan Ramsey.
He did?
He may be dying.
SeIf defense?
No.
Witnesses?
Me.
And everybody in here Iast night.
No excuse for it.
No excuse.
No wonder you ended it between us.
Don't bIame it on BiIIy Roy.
Find what you're Iookin' for?
WeII, weII, weII.
First time I couIdn't open the door
for you, Vince.
I want him Ioose.
You want?
I'II teII you what you get.
That cannon back in Mexico
where it beIongs,
and you in a Mexican court teIIin'
how you stoIe it
and why you did this.
Make him open the door, Vince!
Get these things off me.
You have tiII sundown
to get BiIIy Roy free on the street.
I'II come in for him,
and if he isn't waIking free
down the street,
I'm gonna turn that cannon Ioose.
I'II wipe this town off the face of the earth.
You steaI powder and shot, too?
WeII, you know me, Jess.
AIways thorough.
WeII, tiII sundown.
-Or, if you're smart, before.
-You're not Ieaving here.
Who stops me? You?
Outside.
Don't you Ieave me, Vince. Vince!
Don't you Ieave your brother!
I'm not gonna Ieave you.
Vince.
Jess, you've forgotten how I operate.
You think I'd come into this town
naked as a jaybird?
Let's see.
It's just about time.
AII right, I'II take BiIIy Roy
out the back way right now.
He stays.
And what about them?
That Lieutenant is coming in here to ask
about a man with a new shot mark
on his neck.
Vince!
If you want to keep BiIIy Roy aIive,
you go outside and make sure
he doesn't ask.
AII right, I'II get rid of them, Jess.
After I do, you've got untiI Iast Iight
to get BiIIy Roy free on the street.
AII right, out. Move!
Afterwards,
First, I must see the Iaw officer.
About a wagon, Lieutenant?
A wagon with a big piece
of canvas over it?
And a man with a buIIet burn on his neck?
How do you know about these things?
I move around.
But why do you teII me about the wagon
and this man?
Reward.
I hear 0,000 American doIIars.
$10,000,
WeII, I heard wrong. $10,000.
And you can Iead us to this wagon
and this man?
For $10,000.
The reward wiII be paid,
when the wagon and the man
are recovered and sent back to Mexico.
A hundred yards above the river crossing.
-Do teII.
-I'II sIow them down.
Come in.
-How is he?
-Better than you think.
I've come to ask a favor, Dan.
Ask.
Give me permission to Iet BiIIy Roy go.
Jess, that's admitting you're guiIty
as accused.
If we don't set BiIIy Roy free,
Vince Hackett wiII bIow
your whoIe town apart.
He's got that cannon out there.
He says he'II fire it. I beIieve him.
Don't Iet BiIIy Roy Ioose.
There won't be much Ieft.
You can't give in to him.
You Iet a handfuI of fiIth scare us,
you got nothing Ieft.
HoId that prisoner, Jess.
I'II hoId him.
I'II be right back.
Jess?
Do you want to kiII Dan?
He can't move or be moved.
If aII it takes is to Iet that animaI
you've got in jaiI go free, Iet him go.
I'II do Iike he says, Mrs. Ramsey.
Don't be a damn fooI! Let him go!
My husband made this town safe.
Don't Iisten to him now.
He's hurt. Out of his head.
I'm sorry.
That's your target over there.
I want that gun trained fIat on.
Now, Iet's see what we got here.
Powder.
Fuses.
Long sticks.
BeautifuI. BeautifuI.
You know, the woman at the store
that soId me this must have thought
I was prospecting for goId
at the bottom of the earth.
Yeah.
Do you know what an inch Ieft
on a cut off of this can do?
No, what?
It means a difference in yards
where that dynamite hits.
And the time Vince give us.
BeautifuI.
This is the reguIar crossing.
it is just that.
We don't cross here.
If the wagon is on the other side,
why do we not cross here?
Lieutenant, if you had stoIen something
very big and moved it to the other side,
wouIdn't you train your guns
on the onIy crossing?
Very wise,
Lead on.
I think here, Lieutenant.
Very shaIIow.
It's good for crossing.
After you,
Lige, eIevate two notches.
Lordy, Lordy.
We just may hit them dead on
with the first shot.
I knew you were good, Gunner,
but I didn't know you were that good.
How'd you Iike that? Pinpoint.
Did you ever see anything Iike that?
GeneraI StonewaII Jackson
said I was the best.
He said it right in front
of the whoIe regiment.
We got us a timetabIe, Gunner.
WeII, caII it, Vince.
AIready have.
BiIIy Roy Iet Ioose by sundown.
AII right, get that gun down this hiII
tiII it's a quarter miIe from town.
Down that hiII? Down there?
That ain't a hiII, Vince, that's a cIiff.
AII right. Let's get started.
It ain't right, Vince. It ain't fair to us.
One man's hanging is more better
than five.
I ain't gonna Iet you do it.
AII right! Never mind him.
Gabe! Heff! HauI them muIes in here.
We've got a Iong way to move this gun,
and we're gonna get it into position
if it takes aII day.
AII right, move it!
WeII, Mr. ''Traitor to AII Causes,''
you've been as siIent
as a cricket with its throat cut.
You waitin' for those
to come get you?
Or you waiting for Vince to bIast you,
or maybe the Iaw to catch up to you
for steaIing the cannon?
Your brother'II come in, BiIIy Roy.
Hey, Deputy Wade.
You know what?
I'm gonna teII you a secret.
I aIways Iiked you and admired you.
You never knew that, did you?
You know why I feIt that way about you?
You were the onIy man who ever broke
away from my great God brother
and made it stick!
OnIy you didn't make it stick, did you?
Here you are back with him again.
He's stiII caIIing the shots,
and you're stiII jumping!
See what I mean?
I mention his name,
and you Iook out the window!
He couId be 5,000 miIes away,
and you'd stiII be Iooking!
Less than an hour tiII sundown.
Forty minutes, to be exact.
I thought maybe you couId just
Iet BiIIy Roy go.
We'd ride out. No troubIe.
Get off your horse, Vince.
WaIk toward me.
Just make a move, that's aII I ask.
Just make a move.
You know me, Jess.
I'm not a man of vioIence.
I don't approve of vioIence.
-You know what I'm gonna do?
-What?
I think I'm gonna try
a IittIe Ionger fuse this time.
Oh, no, my God!
Oh, dear God!
Oh, no. Dan?
Oh, no.
No.
No.
Dan? Danny.
Say something.
Danny, don't Ieave me.
You kiIIed him.
You kiIIed him just as if you put
that gun to his head.
I toId you.
I begged you to Iet that animaI go.
But, now, to save your own skin,
you kiIIed Dan.
You see it?
This is a wanted poster.
This man is wanted
by the Mexican government.
He stoIe that gun that's been firing on us,
that kiIIed my husband,
that wiII kiII aII of you.
It says he can be identified
by a wound on his neck.
There it is.
He thought nothing of kiIIing my husband.
He'II think nothing of kiIIing
the rest of you.
Make him Iet that prisoner Ioose.
Force him !
One way to get that gun to stop shooting.
Let BiIIy Roy go.
No troubIe.
-Let him go, Wade.
-We've had enough of this vioIence.
TILFORD: Our roots are in this town,
Wade, not yours.
Get rid of Wade.
HoId it, hoId it. Quiet.
Quiet down, everybody.
You got a cannon pointing at your heads,
and you're wiIIing
to Iet a bunch of riffraff make you crawI.
Maybe you can forget
that Dan Ramsey was just kiIIed.
WeII, I can't.
But there's one thing
you'd better not forget.
He'II bIast you off the face
of the earth no matter what.
Because you know who's got that cannon.
If I don't get up there
and teII them to stop,
that cannon's gonna bIow this town apart.
SELBY: AII right, Mr. Hackett.
Take BiIIy Roy out.
HoId it. First man who wants
to reIease the prisoner, step up.
Keep at it, Jess.
WeII, I'm overdue out of here.
I'm IiabIe to be kiIIed Iike everybody
eIse if you don't Iet BiIIy Roy go.
Keep your eye on the sun, Jess.
JOSLYN: Turn him over to Vince, Mr. Wade.
Thirty minutes, mister,
or we aII come to get you,
and we'II turn him Ioose.
AII right, aII of you cIear the streets.
That cannon wiII be hitting
a few more times.
You've done aII you can do.
Let him go.
I'm keeping him here.
I want to apoIogize.
For what?
Whatever I thought, I was wrong.
You are what you said you'd be.
Don't count on it.
Get off the street.
''Thirty minutes'' come to mean
important words to you, Mr. Wade?
Thirty minutes can get to be as
important as a man's whoIe Iife, can't it?
A very sad haIf hour for you, Mr. Wade.
You Iocking us both up, Mr. Wade?
So we can be cozy?
Not much time, Mr. Wade.
Won't be Iong
before your good citizens come for you,
or my brother bIows this town
to pIowing Iand, and he comes for you.
Take off that gun beIt and come outside.
You finaIIy seen the Iight, Mr. Wade.
You gonna take these things off me
and Iet me go back to my brother.
Mr. Carter.
Mr. Jess Wade was one of them.
That animaI's gone.
Now, maybe that cannon'II stop firing.
Send them a reminder, Gunner.
With pIeasure.
I guess that makes it pretty pIain.
Wade didn't turn BiIIy Roy
over to his brother.
Or he hasn't had the time.
He's had the time.
He couId have waIked there in 10 minutes.
WeII, somebody's gotta ride up there
and teII Vince Hackett
his brother's no Ionger in town.
Harvey, you get the buckboard
and you drive me up there.
No, Miss Tracey.
Tracey, if I have to grab you and hoId you,
you're not going up there.
There's onIy one thing to do.
Get off the streets.
Those of you who have ceIIars,
get down in them.
And take as many of your neighbors
with you as your ceIIars wiII hoId.
Come on, Miss Tracey.
Gunner?
Yeah, Vince.
Can you aim that cannon at night?
These things don't know whether it's day
or night.
Send them one.
We're about ready to knock that town
off the face of the earth.
-Everything goes, except the jaiI.
-Yeah.
AII right, Ioad up.
AII right, yeII.
Vince. Vince, it's me.
It's BiIIy Roy.
I'm down here.
CaII out again! Where are you, BiIIy Roy?
Here, Vince! Here!
Watch out for Wade!
He's up in those rocks.
Those rocks to your Ieft!
Mody. Heff.
Gunner.
Gabe, drop it down three notches.
Vince?
I can see you, Gabe and Gunner.
Where's Heff and Mody?
I don't know where they are, Jess!
If I go, BiIIy Roy goes.
Vince!
He's gonna kiII me!
AII right, Mody, Heff, hoId off!
AII right, it's a standoff, Jess.
What you got on your mind?
Taking that gun back where it came from.
Moving it into town tonight.
If you want to keep BiIIy Roy aIive.
Vince!
Now, maybe you got me
where you want me,
and maybe you haven't.
Anything wrong in taIking about it?
Now, how come so much money
don't appeaI to you, Jess,
when you don't even have
to raise a hand to get it?
Gunner.
Jump, BiIIy, get out of the way!
Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince!
Vince! Vince!
BiIIy Roy?
Wade!
Good friend Jess Wade!
What do you do now, Vince?
I'II teII you what you do now.
You and the cannon go back
to Mexico with me.
It's not his fauIt.
It's not his fauIt.
I know.
WeII, it's a hard thing for me to say, but...
He doesn't know how to say thank you.
I know how. Thank you, Mr. Wade.
Jess!
You're not coming back, are you?
No.
I'II send for you.
You come when I teII you. It won't be Iong.
