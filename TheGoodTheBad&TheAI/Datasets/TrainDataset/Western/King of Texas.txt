Pa, you're missing the dancing.
Are you all right?.
Pa?.
Suzannah's late.
She'll be here.
It's a long ways from Austin.
I don't care how far it is.
I want all three of my daughters here.
By God, I'm old, ain't l, Claudia?.
As old as this land.
As old as Texas, Pa.
Come on.
Everybody's waiting.
There he is. Right there.
Pa.
-Where is he?.
-He'll be along.
Ungrateful lout.
Best not be keeping John Lear waiting.
Now, don't worry about Thomas, Pa.
Let's go. Let's just go.
Play on! Play on!
Great to see you, sir.
-Happy lndependence Day, sir.
-Thank you, sir.
Happy lndependence Day.
-I appreciate it.
-Henry.
-Emmett.
-Mr. Lear, sir.
-Fine-looking horse you have there.
-Best I've ever bred.
Reminds me of that horse you rode
at San Jacinto. I want you to have it.
-That's mighty considerate, Henry.
-Mr. Lear.
Your father just gave me this horse,
Thomas. It was thoughtful.
I'm regretful
you weren't here to see it.
Pa doesn't show
that side of himself often.
-Are you drunk, son?.
-Yes, sir. I've been drinking.
It's a party, ain't it?.
Texas lndependence Day.
There wouldn't be independence if
it weren't for men like your father.
By God, you won't stand before him...
...before me, with that mocking smile
on your face. I will not abide it, sir.
Henry, I'm much obliged to you.
This is as fine a horse as I've seen.
-Thank you, John.
-Rip!
-You take good care of this horse.
-Yes, sir.
-Come on, Pa.
-What is wrong with you?.
Does it please you to make
a fool out of your father?.
To hell with you, boy!
I've had enough of it, Emmett.
-I had a whole lifetime of it.
-I know, I know.
You still going to San Antonio
for a few days?.
What do you mean?.
Just now might be a good time, is all.
I'll take on your chores, I don't mind.
It'll give Pa a chance to cool down
and you a chance to think things over.
Hell, I might do that right now.
Thank you.
-Rebecca.
-Suzannah. So glad to see you.
-How is he?.
-More unpredictable than ever.
-Has he done anything crazy?.
-No, but it's still early.
Hello, Pa.
-How are you?.
-I'm tolerable. You're late.
-Mr. Tumlinson.
-Happy lndependence Day.
Claudia!
You've been taking good care of him.
He's ornery as ever.
By God, I am. Come on up to the house,
I got something to tell you gals.
Come on.
Whoa, now!
Close the gate!
Lear!
John Lear!
Where are you?.
-You hung two of my vaqueros!
-Vaqueros?.
They were cattle thieves.
They butchered a cow with my brand.
They were starving.
You drove them from their land.
It's my land, Menchaca, my cattle.
You hung two men for one cow!
What kind of man are you?.
You know what kind of man I am.
Your father knowed it too.
My father would have shot you
dead already, viejo!
You're welcome to try that.
Why don't you try that right now?.
-This is not over.
-Si. Claro.
Now, get off my land
before I hang you too.
Should have driven him right across
the Rio Grande when we had a chance.
It's not too late for that.
President Houston
asked me to deliver this.
How is Sam?. He ever sober up any?.
Where'd I put my spectacles?.
-It's a proclamation. Shall I read it?.
-Oh, hell, I suppose so.
"On this anniversary of the birth
of our republic, we honor the man...
...without whose valiant spirit
Texas would never have been won.
During the darkest days of our
struggle, when the Alamo fell...
...when his own beloved son
was martyred at Goliad, John Lear--"
All right, Tumlinson,
I get the point of it.
Houston always was a long-winded,
preachifying son of a bitch.
But I got more important matters
to discuss today.
There's the Palo Blanco...
...all 200,000 acres of it.
There's the main house.
There's your place, Rebecca.
Every creek in between.
Every acre paid for in blood.
Always thought I'd turn the place
over to my boy...
...but he's dead and gone.
It's come to me how my life
ain't been more concern...
...to this land than a blade of grass
or a mesquite tree.
Just one more thing that lived on it
and had its day and passed on.
But by God...
...I can still decide who owns it.
I have decided to divide up the ranch.
-What do you mean, Daddy?.
-As from today...
...I am giving the ranch over
to you three gals.
I wanna get all this settled now
so there won't be any fighting...
...amongst you after I'm gone.
-Are you feeling all right?.
-I'm feeling fine, Claudia.
I'm even gonna lead the roundup
this year, like always.
But I won't be here forever,
and I wanna get this settled.
And who gets which part of the land?.
Well, Suzannah,
I suppose that depends.
On what?.
On who loves their father the most.
Go ahead, you're the eldest, Suzannah.
Speak up.
There's no man in this country
who can stand next to my father.
No man who ever could.
You came to Texas with nothing...
...and you made an empire.
Maybe you were hard,
but that's because you had to be.
If you hadn't been, we would've been
carried away by Comanches years ago.
So I love you for your strength.
And I love you for the strength
you gave me.
I'll give you all the land
east of Las Animas Creek.
There's good range there,
all the way up to the headwaters.
-But your house is on that side.
-I know that, Suzannah.
I'll move downstairs. You and
your husband can move in up here.
I'll spend half the year with you
and half at Rebecca's.
That appeal to you, Mr. Tumlinson?.
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
It's very generous.
Now, Rebecca.
-Daddy, I don't know what to say.
-You don't?.
If I had Suzannah's way with words,
I could tell you how much I love you.
Hush, Claudia. You'll get your turn.
It's not a speaking thing.
It's a feeling thing.
It's the same feeling when I ride
across the prairie before dawn...
...and the sun comes up
and warms my face...
...and all the wildflower blossoms
start to open.
That's how much I love you, Daddy.
Like I love the sun.
I'll give you all the land
west of the creek--
Sir.
The soil in there gets very salty.
It's not good for grazing.
I know that.
You hold your horses, Highsmith.
All land west of the creek...
...and south of the ruins
of that old Spanish fort.
-You like that any better?.
-Yes, sir. I do.
Now, Claudia, I'll listen to you.
There's some prime land left.
I have nothing to say.
What did she say?.
She said she had nothing to say.
-Nothing?.
-Nothing!
Nothing can come of nothing.
You best think again.
I won't. This is false.
I want nothing to do with it.
False?. What do you mean, false?.
Heed your words, unless you
wanna throw away your fortune.
A child either loves her father
or she doesn't.
-Yes!
-Well, say it.
-Why won't you say it?.
-Because you should see it, Pa.
Don't I prove my love to you every day,
living here, taking care of you?.
Suzannah and Rebecca took husbands.
She's just proud.
She's her father's daughter.
You keep out of this, Tumlinson.
Say it, Claudia.
Love isn't something you can command.
It's either there or it's not.
Say it.
-No.
-Say it!
John, I think if you consider--
What kind of child is this?.
Is this a child
I sheltered in my house?.
A child I gave my heart to?.
She's got no more feeling
than a low-down rattlesnake!
It's because I have too much feeling--
All these years, pretending
to love your father...
...when all you had inside you
was hateful poison!
By God, I won't keep no rattler
in this house!
-You have no portion!
-That's enough!
Who the hell are you, telling John Lear
how much he can speak?.!
-Pa.
-Too late, Claudia! I won't listen!
I won't look into your face ever again!
You have no home! No father!
Go! Get!
-You can't send her away like this--
-Keep your silence in my presence.
Or, by God, I will strike you down!
You understand me, sir?.
Why are you still here?.
Get out of my house.
I will divide the ranch equally
between you two gals and your husbands.
-Daddy!
-Don't say nothing to me, Rebecca.
I don't care to hear it.
I bid you all good day.
It'll be all right.
He'll come to his senses.
No, he won't.
He won't ever let me come back.
Suzannah and I will be living here.
We'll talk to him.
Come on.
The division north to south
along the creek is fair.
-Does it suit you, Mr. Highsmith?.
-I'll tell you what will suit me.
That's Menchaca's land.
Menchaca says it is.
It's disputed land. Everybody knows it.
-A man could run a lot of cattle there.
-And start another war.
We never finished the last one.
-My husband wouldn't allow it.
-Of course not.
Your husband's a good man.
Member of the Texas government.
But isn't he going back to Austin soon
to meet with the legislature?.
-I don't know--
-Hush. I'm talking to your sister.
Now, you and l...
...we know a fight with Menchaca
is inevitable.
We've got to get the first lick in
if we're to have any hope of victory.
Claudia?.
Miss Claudia!
Miss Claudia, where are you going?.
What has happened, Claudia?.
He turned me out.
Your father?.
-You shouldn't be so hard on Thomas.
-Why not?.
If I hadn't promised his mother
the ranch would be his--
No use speaking about that.
I learned to live with being a bastard.
And the ranch ain't big enough
to split up.
Where are the horses?.
They're all gone, Pa!
Placido.
I'm gonna kill the man that done this.
Careful.
-Put it on the far side of the parlor.
-Si, senora.
Music!
That's what this house has been
missing since your ma passed on.
You're making this
a proper home again.
After a week or two on the campo,
I might want a tune out of this piano.
-I'll play you one.
-Make me a peach pie.
After a roundup,
I'm partial to peach pie.
I will, Pa.
-Warnell.
-Ma'am.
Keep an eye on him.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning, men!
-Fine day for a roundup.
-You're right about that, boss.
You too old to go on a roundup.
I ain't particularly interested
in your opinion, Rip.
I know that.
You never been interested
in anybody's opinion.
-You fall off and you break your neck.
-I don't intend to fall off.
Well, I expect you never intended
to get so damn old, either.
Rip, saddle your horse.
-Why?.
-Because you're going with me.
I believe I'll stay right here.
This place gets pleasant
when you ain't around.
It ain't my business
to make your life pleasant.
-You're going with us.
-Why?.
Because you're the only son of a bitch
that could make me laugh.
Mount up, men!
Rip, over there, in the flank!
Get along, there!
By God, this is a tonic
being out here again.
I don't think nothing suits me better
than hard country and wild cattle.
Rip, you sing me a song.
Maybe you need to come live
among these cows...
...since your singing voice ain't fit
for no human to hear.
By God, Rip, I don't know
why I let you talk to me that way.
If you were a mite brainier, you'd
watch your tongue, have fear of me.
All the fear got scared out of me
at the Alamo.
Who the hell's that?.
-Afternoon.
-Afternoon to you, sir.
-You would be Mr. Westover?.
-That's right.
-Lieutenant Williams, U.S. Army.
-What can I do for you?.
I was hoping you'd have more horses
to sell. Army needs good stock.
I never sold horses to no Army.
They had your brand on them.
It was a legal transaction.
-How many was it you bought?.
-I believe it was 1 8.
-Who sold them to you?.
-Didn't care to give his name.
-What did he look like?. A Mexican?.
-He weren't Mexican.
He had some height to him,
brown hair...
...and as I recollect
he had a scar on his forehead.
Didn't look like no horse thief,
if that's what you're thinking.
Better move on, mister.
Ain't no horses for sale here.
Sorry to trouble you, then.
Good day to you both.
I'm sure it's a mistake.
Of course it's a mistake.
Eighteen horses, Emmett, 1 8!
That man said he had a scar
on his forehead like Thomas has.
Thomas would never
do anything like that.
He'd never steal from his own father.
You just put it out of your mind, Pa.
Bring them up, there.
Hard work. Mind if I water my horse?.
Just your horse.
Because I wouldn't want no slave
to foul this water by drinking from it.
I told you not to do that.
You're that son of a bitch
from the Alamo, aren't you?.
Did you ever notice how a mesquite
branch is all covered with thorns?.
The Lord was thinking about runaway
slaves when he created that tree.
I ain't no runaway slave.
How's a feller to know any different?.
You got a paper saying you ain't?.
You got a paper saying you ain't
a pea-brained son of a bitch?.
Well, now, did that hurt enough?.
I thought he was
running away from you.
I thought he was stealing that horse
and running away--
No, no! Don't hit me no more, boss.
You gonna interfere
with my property again?.
No, sir, I ain't.
Get the hell out of here!
I believe one of the boys in the outfit
has got some aloe salve.
I appreciate it, but then
my shirt's all ripped to hell.
Why you telling me?.
I ain't no damn seamstress.
I ain't never took you for one.
You get on your horse
before we waste any more time.
-You're heading home, I see.
-Time to go to our part of the ranch.
As you know, my husband will be gone
for several weeks, at least.
What do you have in mind?.
Let's not play games, Mr. Highsmith.
-We'll need men.
-I have a dozen at my ranch.
-We'll need more.
-We should talk to Mr. Westover.
If the man who captured Santa Ana
joins us, others will too.
She's right.
Westover's always game for a fight.
He'll want to know where Lear stands.
Tell him my father stands with us.
I hope you brought your brother
something from San Antonio.
A bottle of whiskey
might be just the thing.
Where's the horses?.
You best ask Pa about that. He's inside
taking supper. I'll see to your gear.
Hey, how you doing, Pa?.
Where's the horses?.
Stoled.
Stole?. All of them?.
Oh, hell, where's Placido?.
You know damn well where he is.
Lying in his grave.
He's what?.
I don't know why
you would do such a thing.
But I guess if a man's got enough hate
in his heart, he can do anything.
You think I stole our horses?.
That I killed Placido?.
Look at me, Pa. Look at me!
-You think I stole them horses.
-I do.
Boy, I don't see that bottle
of whiskey in here.
Hell, you must really hate me.
I drink some and I shoot my mouth off.
But I ain't no thief and no murderer!
-Pa, that ain't mine.
-Liar!
You're a liar, a horse thief
and a murderer!
-You lost your mind with age, old man!
-Get out.
Get out of my house.
Don't you never come back.
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me.
How was my performance?.
Think I should take to the boards?.
You really should.
Me and my men have done
right by you, Mr. Westover.
Made a good profit from them horses.
Fifty-fifty, just like we said.
Do you mind if I keep the uniform?.
I admire the way I look in it.
You can keep the uniform.
A fair increase, Suzannah.
Hardly a cow this year
without a calf to suck on her.
I hope to hell
you made that peach pie.
-You beat Warnell half to death.
-He was torturing Rip.
You should've come to me.
I would have dealt with it.
Come to you?.
That'll be a cold day in hell.
I can take care of my own business.
-This coffee's cold as well water.
-You gave up business, did you forget?.
If one of my men needs to be punished,
I will do the deciding.
You will watch your tongue with me.
Get some supper on!
My men are hungry.
They've been herding cattle.
I'll feed your men. But don't expect
any hospitality. You won't find it.
-Not after what you did to Warnell.
-Show some respect.
Respect. Respect for you,
you pathetic, addled old man.
Riling me is pleasurable, ain't it?.
Rile me more, and you will be sorry.
Now, you get some supper on.
For me and for my men.
There you go. Give me another one.
-What are you doing?.
-We're raising holy hell, Suzannah!
Well, you stop it right now!
I won't have your men shooting
off their guns around my house.
You'll have it
if I say you'll have it.
I want to see you make that bell ring.
Better ring that bell.
Get out of here!
-Leave my house.
-Your house?. This is my house.
Not anymore.
By God, you'd do it, wouldn't you?.
You'd kill your own father.
You men, go on, now.
Go on to the bunkhouse.
-Go on! Do as I tell you!
-They won't obey you. They work for me.
No, they don't. They work for me.
You hear that?. You work for me!
If you don't do as I say,
you'll never see your wages again.
I own the ranch now!
-Mr. Lear?.
-Go on. Do like she says.
You and the rest of the men,
get out of here.
Go on, get out of here! All of you!
Why?.
Why, Suzannah?.
Why have you turned against me?.
I gave you the ranch.
I gave you everything!
You didn't give it to me, Pa.
You sold it to me.
You came up with the price
and I met it.
And don't you think
that price came easy to me.
Having to say I loved you, when
all I've ever felt for you was hate.
Hate?.
You are nothing but an old tyrant.
That's all you are.
You worked our mother to death.
And you never took no notice
of Rebecca or me.
Ever.
All you cared about was your son.
And after he died,
all you cared about was Claudia.
Well, they're gone now,
and your day is over.
No, it ain't over.
And when it's over...
...I'll rise up out of the pit,
and I'll haunt you to your grave!
I'll do something.
I don't know what, but you'll
be sorry you lived to see it!
I remember the day you were born.
Your ma held you up to me and she
said, "John, here is your daughter."
And you were a fine, healthy child.
And I had a tender feeling
in my heart for you that day.
But that feeling is gone
from my heart.
You're dead to me now,
dead as winter grass!
I only got one daughter now!
Well, she's welcome to have you!
I hope Miss Highsmith'll be happier
to see you than Miss Tumlinson.
Rebecca's a devoted child.
The only one in the bunch.
-You sure of that?.
-Yes, I'm sure.
She told me so.
-What?.
-I used to think old people was wise.
But they ain't.
You sure the proof of that.
I never said I was wise.
I never boasted about a damn thing.
Why do my children hate me, Rip?.
-Don't ask if you don't want the truth.
-You tell me.
Because there ain't
no love in you. Only pride.
I'm in a hurtful way, Rip.
The way I deal with pain is
to pretend it's done with.
-What do you mean?.
-What I mean is...
...I think of myself like I was dead.
Supposed to be, anyway. I was
supposed to be killed at the Alamo.
So I'm a ghost, I reckon.
Pain don't bother me none. People
don't either. All that's done with.
Where are you going?.
I think Rebecca's house is over there.
Yeah. Just behind
the shoulder of that hill.
Yes, that's it.
Well, I'm all right now.
I just got a little turned
around there for a while.
Her house ain't thataway.
-You sure?.
-I'm sure.
It ain't right that I should be lost.
This is my land. I own it. I know it.
By God, I created
this land out of nothing.
Come on, now.
We'll find Miss Highsmith's house.
Am I going mad, Rip?.
I don't know.
Don't let me go mad, Rip.
You shoot me first.
You can attack soon.
-But how does Lear stand on this?.
-Lear is with us.
John Lear's a careful man
for all his temper.
-He must see some advantage to it.
-He does.
-How many men would we need?.
-About 1 00 men.
Menchaca's got a lot of vaqueros
at his place and two six-pounders.
-We need some cannons ourselves.
-We'll get it, especially if you join.
Your husband got himself
a bold notion.
-He's a bold man.
-Reckless one is what I heard.
And mean. The sort of man that
might take after his own wife.
-That's hateful gossip.
-Don't mean it ain't true.
You worried about me?.
It's possible I am.
Your pa listens to you.
-Make sure he joins us.
-Why?.
Because there's gain to be had.
Land and cattle.
And other things.
Rebecca?.
Rebecca!
John, welcome.
Come in and take a horn with me.
We've got some business to discuss.
That I will. Rebecca.
Rebecca, I went to your house
looking for you.
They told me you were here.
I needed you, Rebecca.
Something happen to Suzannah?.
She turned me out.
-Well, I'm sure she didn't mean to.
-No.
You know the respect a child owes her
father. You're the only one that does.
-Why are you here?.
-To talk about the plan.
Plan?. What plan?.
To ride against Menchaca.
Same plan they told you.
Menchaca?. Nobody told me nothing
about fighting Menchaca.
-This was your idea, Highsmith?.
-lt is.
And you'd do well to join us.
If not for the Menchacas,
your son would be alive.
I know why my son is dead.
And you know I gave an oath to Sam
Houston to not touch Menchaca's land.
You came into my house and lied?.
I'm not gonna tolerate that.
But you'll tolerate
Menchaca right there.
A land that ought to belong to Texas!
Ought to belong to us!
Can't you see?.
This is our chance.
Any man that doesn't take
his chance is a coward.
You call me a coward, sir?. By God,
I saw your courage at San Jacinto.
Shooting down Mexicans
that was trying to surrender.
Any man that talks to me like that,
I'll tickle his ribs.
You'd be with us,
if you had any sand left.
-Why, you--
-Daddy.
Get your horse, Rebecca.
You're coming with me.
I should have never let you marry a man
with such viciousness and treachery.
I'm taking you away from him.
-I ain't going.
-You ain't going?. Why?.
-He's my husband.
-Child, he ain't fit to be your husband.
I know I ain't always
been a proper father.
But I loved you the best
of my daughters.
-No, you didn't.
-The hell, you say. I know my heart!
Oh, you were always
my favorite, Rebecca.
Come on. It's just gonna be you
and me from now on.
Don't you defy me, child!
I'm staying with my husband.
Fine. You stay.
You stay with that fine man.
-You're well-suited.
-Daddy.
Get on!
You're no part of me anyway...
...except as a disease or sickness
in my body is part of me.
Please stop it.
You're my enemy, just as
your sisters are my enemy.
You have your fight with Menchaca.
But when you scream for your daddy...
...when those vaqueros have you
on your back, knives at your throat...
...when you're screaming
for John Lear, I won't hear you.
I'll be deaf to your cries.
So I bid you all good day.
May you all burn in hell.
Daddy.
You're a fool, Highsmith.
You'll see who's the fool.
Come, Rebecca.
Come.
Rip!
Where are you going?.
You turning away from me too?.
Is it true what they say?.
They fixing to raid Menchaca?.
That's true, Rip.
Then Miss Claudia in danger.
-Claudia's at Menchaca's?.
-That she is.
How do you know?.
I'm just accustomed
to seeing things with my eyes.
Somebody got to warn her.
Do you remember that terrible storm
when we were children?.
Your father and my father went to the
campo to keep the cattle from drowning.
I remember.
My grandmother was sick
and your mother came with medicine.
That was the first time I saw you.
I'm alone.
Westover, what is so important
you would risk coming here?.
Where's Miss Claudia?.
-Claudia's not here.
-I know she is.
Well, you need not worry.
If she were here, she'd be safe.
-I don't think she would be.
-Why not?.
God forgive me for saying this.
There's a plan.
They're coming to take your land.
I don't remember a time
without a plan.
But this time it's gonna happen.
Highsmith's gathering men.
No. Lear would not be doing this.
He's capable of many things,
but he never break his word.
Lear's not in charge.
He's been turned out.
-Who turned him out?.
-The other daughters.
He ain't got no home to go to anymore.
You've got to find him, Mr. Henry,
and bring him to me.
Miss Claudia.
Find my father, Mr. Henry. Please.
He'll listen to you.
He's always respected you.
Bring him back to me, please.
Come on, over here!
It's coming right down on us.
Let it come.
So you've riled yourself up
against me too, have you?.
You think I'm old!
You think I'm weak!
Just like my daughters!
You see?.
You missed me! I'm still here!
I'm still my god in my saddle!
-You want to get yourself killed?.
-I don't give a damn!
Blow!
You bastard wind, blow!
I'm right here!
Come and get me!
Don't be afraid!
There ain't nothing standing
in your way but me!
Get me! Right down here.
Come on! Come on!
Lear!
Lear!
Somebody calling.
Oh, yes. There's somebody calling.
There must have been a storm.
There's a fresh smell in the air.
Look at that sky.
You ever see a sky so blue?.
John!
John?.
John.
I heard somebody calling.
Was that you?.
It was me.
I don't think I know you.
I used to know everybody
in this country...
...but there are so damn
many of them now.
It's Henry. Henry Westover.
I'm your friend.
I thank you, friend. Sit down.
You got children, mister?.
-Two boys. You know them.
-I do?.
I had a son of my own once, I believe.
I can't quite recall.
Well, I got daughters.
Three of them.
They make a man proud...
...the way they look at you
with their eyes full of love.
Just shining with love
for their father.
There ain't no better feeling
in this world, is there, mister...
...than to know you done right
by your children?.
No, John, no better feeling.
Why are you crying, mister?.
-Come on, I wanna take you home.
-Oh, no. I don't need to go anywhere.
This is my home,
right here where I sit.
Hey, you see him?.
By God, I'm right up there with him.
I feel everything he feels.
I'm looking down
on everything that he sees.
I'm right up there with him,
sailing in the wind.
Come on, to the place!
The place where he's going!
Come on!
Don't you wanna see it, that place?.
The place where he's going?. Come on.
Where'd he go?.
Come on, God, where'd he go?.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Don't you turn your back on me!
Come back!
Don't you turn away from me!
Emmett!
-Mr. Westover.
-What do you want, Highsmith?.
I wanna know where you've been.
How do you know
that I've been anywheres?.
Did Emmett tell you?.
Now, Mr. Westover,
we'll see who's the fool.
Help him.
-Where were you?. Who did you talk to?.
-Go to hell.
-Where were you?. Who did you talk to?.
-You're wasting your time.
We're gonna have to move fast.
Gather whatever men you can
and meet at my house.
-How do you know they'll follow me?.
-I'll pay them.
I don't know what you want out of life,
but I suspect it's something big.
You don't aspire to small things,
do you?.
Small never appealed to me.
It was just the only thing
ever offered.
A man wants something big,
he's gotta go out and get it.
Smithwick! Davis!
Bring him over here.
Now, hold him tight.
Hold him steady, now. Hold him.
Hold him, damn it!
-No, I won't do that.
-Get back here!
-Get back here.
-I won't do that.
-Get back here, damn it! Hold him!
-I got him.
-Hold him.
-I got him.
You got one eye left and you don't
want me to burn that out.
Tell me where you--
-You shot me, you son of a bitch.
-Yes, sir, I did.
-Are you planning to interfere?.
-No, ma'am.
He's dead, Rebecca.
-He's dead.
-You'll burn in hell.
Hold him down.
You know me, don't you?.
Are we dead, you and me?.
We're not dead, Pa.
Pa?.
I should know you.
Please don't laugh.
I think you're my daughter.
Claudia?.
Yes, it's me.
I see you now. I see you clear enough.
Oh, how you must hate me, child.
No. No, I love you.
I love you.
-Where am l?.
-Senor Lear.
It's all right, Pa.
How do you mean?.
What am I doing in his house?.
He helped rescue you.
And he's been protecting me.
The hell you say.
He's the enemy of our blood.
What the hell is going on?.
Senor, we are expecting an attack.
An attack?. Who from?.
Highsmith and my two other daughters.
Sir, forgive our accommodations...
... but this is the safest place
in the hacienda. Stay here.
Senor.
I'll stand with you.
No, no, no. Stay with your daughter.
You belong with her now.
You men, help them finish
loading that wagon.
Hope your canteens are full.
It is hotter than hell.
-Bring it up.
-There we go.
Captain Tumlinson's due back any day.
Don't concern yourself
with my husband.
When you get back,
we'll take care of that together.
Her husband ain't even
been dead a week.
Funny how some people
are cold-hearted.
All right, mount up.
Let's go.
What are we doing, Suzannah?.
What has become of us?.
Don't be softhearted, Rebecca.
Not now.
Anybody there?.
No!
-No, Pa.
-Leave me alone.
Pa, it's me. It's Thomas.
It's Thomas, Pa.
Come on now, Pa.
Thomas.
You've come back.
You're back.
You're back.
How could I ever thought
you stole those horses?.
Why would Emmett do such a thing?.
So he could take
what was rightfully yours.
That's not enough for him anymore.
What do you mean?.
I know he sent Highsmith that day.
He knew what he would do.
He knew well enough.
-Don't say that. I won't believe it.
-lt was Emmett, son.
-Then I'll kill him.
-No.
I was blind before. I couldn't see
the hate in Emmett's heart.
But you, you....
Will you forgive me?.
Hello, Enrique. Good to see you.
Suzannah. Suzannah.
Rebecca.
-You're back early.
-Yes. Where are all the men?.
-Out on the campo.
-Doing what?. Roundup's over, isn't it?.
There was a storm. Cattle scattered
before the men could bring them in.
Where's your husband?.
He was murdered.
Murdered by one of the hands.
We had his funeral two days ago.
I can show you his grave, Henry.
I want to speak to Lear.
We don't know where he is.
He disappeared.
Then why are you sitting here?.
Why aren't you looking for him?.
It's Menchaca's, isn't it?.
You're too late.
You're too late to stop it, Henry.
But you're not too late
to share in its success.
Don't try to stand in our way.
Go.
Don't be afraid.
You're with your father.
Rip?. Rip, I say.
Bring me a damn rifle.
Rip?. Rip, come back here.
Come back here, damn you!
What you want now?. Want your horse
so you can ride after another storm?.
No, I wanna say something.
Well, go on. Go on and say it.
And quit staring at me like that.
You look like you're about to squirt
blood out of your eyes like a toad.
What you got to say?.
Thank you, Rip.
You ain't welcome.
He must have got word that
we was coming and skedaddled.
They did.
I thought Menchaca had
more fight in him than that.
What are we waiting for?.
There ain't nobody there.
You take 1 0 men,
you go scout inside. You 1 0!
Ambush!
Put down your weapons
and you will live.
Put them down!
To hell with you!
Bust those gates open, now!
Fire.
Fire.
Look like the damn Alamo
all over again.
Through the gates! Through the gates!
Get those gates open, now!
Move it. Let's go!
Fall back!
Where's your father?.
No!
That's enough.
That's enough.
Do you hear me, damn it?.
Pa!
-Stop it! Stop!
-Pa!
No more!
-Hear me--
-Miss Claudia!
Stop! Stop! Hold your fire!
Pull back!
Damn you.
Murderers!
Claudia. Claudia.
Claudia.
Rip.
See?. This feather stirs.
She's breathing! She's alive!
That ain't nothing but the wind.
No, you're wrong, Rip.
I know the difference.
This is her breath.
She's alive.
But she's not, John. She's not.
Look at him.
He's alive.
Not Claudia.
She's dead as the ground.
Look there.
Look there.
You did this.
It needed doing.
Where's Emmett?.
Rebecca...
...show some pride.
I'll see you hang for this,
and what you did to Westover.
Will you?.
No. Leave her.
Suzannah!
Suzannah!
Where's she going?.
Somebody tell me where she's going!
Don't touch me.
Where are you taking me?.
Mr. Tumlinson,
where are they taking me?.
You hear that?.
What is it?.
It's that mountain lion.
-There ain't no mountain lion.
-Damn it, I heared it, didn't l?.
He's out there waiting
for us to go to bed...
...so he can come here
and kill one of our horses.
-He ain't gonna kill our horses.
-How do you know that?.
Because I'm out here,
and I'll be keeping watch, Pa.
I expect you will.
I know you will, Thomas.
