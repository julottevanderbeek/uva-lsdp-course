Gwangi.
No, no.
Leave it. He who takes
from Gwangi the evi one is cursed.
-Ony by an od woman's tongue.
- te you...
...if he does not go back
to the Forbidden Vaey...
...we sha a suffer a terribe fate. My eyes
are bind, but  can sti see the signs.
Keep your superstitions
to yoursef, od woman.
Foo.
One day he wi earn
to obey the aw of Gwangi...
...or ike his brother, he wi perish.
Howdy, ma'am.
-Carry your case, senor?
-Don't bother me, boy.
-But don't you need a guide?
-No, don't need a guide.
-What about an interpreter?
-Or an interpreter.
-You need a horse?
-Now ook, boy,  tod you...
... don't need anything.
Now get ost, comprende? Adiós.
There is no money in that, senor.
-You want to do something for me?
-f the money is right.
-Te me where the arena is.
-Two mies out of town.
-Two mies?
-You' need that horse, senor. And a guide.
You're a rea huster.
bet your pappy sends you out husting...
...whie he stays home taking a siesta.
No, senor, my papa is dead.
run my own business. My name is Lope.
Okay, Lope, you and me
wi do some business together.
-Now how about getting me that horse?
-Ten pesos, senor.
And 5 more for the sadde.
The first miion's
aways the toughest, Lope.
Ladies and gentemen...
... now have the honor to present...
...the ovey and taented star
of our show...
...riding Wonder Horse Omar...
...Miss T.J. Breckenridge.
-We, ' be.
-Hey, Tuck. Tuck Kirby.
Hi, there.
Now, what in the name of Sam Hi
brings you around here?
Up to no good, that's for sure.
You don't seem gad to see me, Champ.
About as gad as a dying mue
to see a vuture.
'm no vuture.
Bird on the wing, maybe.
Yeah, fying to the next quick buck.
We, it ooks ike you finay made it.
- make out a right.
-A you care about is yoursef...
...no matter who gets hurt.
sti care what happens to T.J.
Yeah, aways did.
Fussing around her ike a mother hen.
Her daddy was a friend. Somebody's
gotta protect her from guys ike you.
-Running out on her ike you did.
-You weren't sorry to see me go.
Nope, but it darn near broke T.J.'s heart.
Yeah. From what  hear,
you're not doing so good by her either.
Not enough customers
to pay the bi.
We don't need any big shot coming
around here teing us how to run this show.
-Now, why don't you just go back--
-Wait a minute.
We, that's her tune.
That's the grand finae, isn't it?
We, now, 'm surprised you remembered.
We, excuse me,  gotta see this.
For od times' sake, you understand?
Caros.
Hurry up with that ramp.
-Howdy there, partner.
-Ex-partner.
And to what do we owe
this unpeasant surprise?
-'m just ooking around.
-For troube.
They say it comes in threes.
wonder what the next two wi be.
Hey, you can't go in there!
Get out.
-Been a ong time, T.J.
-Do you want to get kied?
You're the one
who's aways trying it out there.
Don't start that again.
You and me are gonna have
a nice itte tak...
...or  might just
put you across my knee.
Fat chance. This is T.J., remember?
Sure,  remember.
-f you don't mind, 'd ike to change.
-We, go on, go ahead.
Hey, you hesitated up there,
before the jump.
The sight of you woud upset
your own mother.
-Not puing much of a crowd.
-We pay Viarosa next.
Things wi be better there.
-You sure?
-Sure, 'm sure.
-Why is that?
-What do you care?
You've got your own business now.
Yep. That's right. A one-man operation.
Sitting in a nice office,
buying and seing acts...
...instead of getting knocked off
horses for 1 0 bucks.
-t's haf the risk, twice the pay.
-So mind your own business.
'm doing just that.
Got a dea for you, T.J.
Get you off the hook with
this broken-down, moth-eaten rodeo.
-f you got a brain, you' take it.
-Thanks.
Buffao Bi wants to buy Omar the
Wonder Horse. He's offering a good price.
-And you get 1 0°%, right?
-Twenty.
We, you're not getting
one thin dime out of me.
And Buffao Bi is not getting Omar.
And you needn't think you can come...
...busting in here ike some hick-town
horse-deaer trying to ruin my show.
There's peope depending on me:
Champ, Caros, Bean, Rowdy.
But you woudn't know much
about oyaty, woud you?
-This is business.
-You pay your con tricks...
...and ' stick to horse tricks.
Now beat it.
My, my. Aways did ook sweet in a temper.
-Get out,  said.
-A right, 've hotter irons in the fire.
You just keep strugging, eaping off
patforms into a pot of water.
Break your neck if you want to.
Makes no difference to me.
Good.
Just worried about that horse up there.
Woudn't ike anything to happen to him.
Excuse me.
Good for you, T.J. You shoud've done
that a ong time ago. Thrown him out.
say! Heo, there. Over here, sir!
-Someone you know?
-A cient of mine, Professor Bromey.
-What's he doing out there?
-He digs for od bones and things.
Heo!
Sounds ike he dug himsef
into troube. Come on.
- say, thank heavens you came aong.
-What has happened, professor?
''What has happened, professor?''
You know very we what has happened.
-Rosita?
-Rosita. Rosita's my mue.
She absoutey refused to budge.
Then she kicked me.
- don't know where she's gone now.
-You hurt?
We, there are no bones broken,
but it's frightfuy painfu.
Oh,  don't beieve we've met.
My name is Bromey.
-Hi, name's Tuck Kirby.
-How do you do?
Hey, hop on, we' give you a ride back.
We, perhaps Lope's mount
might be a itte more practica.
Wait, my boy.
Up.
Right.
You ought to know better than
to get behind a stubborn mue.
Your advice comes a itte ate, Mr. Kirby.
Look, professor,
Rosita's found her way home.
Vicious beast.
Give me your shouder, Lope.
'd say you coud use
a good, stiff drink.
You're right, Mr. Kirby.
t's in the trunk there.
Lope tes me you're one of these
archaeoogist feows.
We, he's pretty near the mark.
Actuay...
...'m a paeontoogist.
-We dig deeper.
-My father used to say...
...it is not good to dig up the past.
Let seeping dogs ie, eh?
We're not gonna get very far
that way, are we?
-That depends on where you want to get to.
-The bottom of things, of course.
What Darwin did with
his theory of evoution...
... intend to do with
my theory of humanoids.
-''Humanoids''?
-t means, ''man-ike.''
t's beieved amongst paeontoogists
that man first evoved a miion years ago.
intend to prove it was
many eons before that.
f you'd ike to ook in that trunk,
you' find a piece of rock. Wi you get it?
That's it.
Now ook at the fossi.
The impression eft in the rock.
-That ooks ike some sort of footprint.
-Precisey, it's an Eohippus.
-Eo...?
-Eohippus.
The so-caed dawn horse.
The ancestor of our present-day horses.
never saw a horse sma enough
to eave a print ike that.
Did you notice it had three toes?
Over the period of evoution,
horses have grown arger.
And that center toe has become
the hoof as we know it.
What is more incredibe
is the fossi beside it.
am convinced that
is the tibia of some humanoid...
...that existed at the same time
as the Eohippus.
Possiby more than 50 miion years ago.
-You found this thing around here?
-n the foothis.
This is my whoe ife, Mr. Kirby,
but  need time and money.
My resources,
both financia and physica...
...are running precariousy ow.
We, professor, what you
need is a good rest.
Yes, Mr. Kirby.
Thank you for your kindness.
Lope.
' bet you didn't know that
was your midde toe, did you?
-T.J.?
-Yeah?
-Can  speak to you a moment?
-Of course.
n private.
You want that money  owe you.
Don't worry, you' get it.
-We' pack them in with our new attraction.
-Yes, E Diabo wi be a big success--
-Quiet. That's between us.
-t's not ony money.
-What ese?
-Us. Together. You and me and Diabo--
n the meantime, et's see
how we go in Viarosa.
Hi there, hon.
thought  tod you to go.
-t's about that dea.
-So go!
-You've been thinking about it?
-Nothing has been further from my mind...
...with the possibe exception of you.
Hey, toro.
Hey, toro. Hey, hey, toro.
Lope!
Hey, hey, toro.
Tuck!
Daring, are you a right?
Cut it out, Tuck, if you want me
to get on with the repairs.
You know it's not easy
for me to keep sti with you...
...hanging around me ike that.
Who was that fea
jumped the bu, anyway?
-Oh, Caros.
-'m gad he was there.
-He saved your ife.
-Yeah.
Why did you wak out on me, Tuck?
was ready to se out, to marry you.
That's a  ever wanted.
don't know.
know  didn't want to.
Getting married is ike
being a horse tied up in a corra.
never coud take being
a roped up ike that.
T.J., you know what?
just know you're gonna se me Omar.
That's right. You've got a dea.
Wait a minute. What's going on?
Nothing. Anything for you, baby.
Don't give me any of that ''baby'' stuff.
What's the pitch?
-Caros brought me a new act.
-What kind of an act?
-Stick around. Come to the opening at--
-No, no,  mean now.
A right, ' show you tonight.
But first the patient must rest,
or he might have a reapse.
-And reapses can be fata.
-T.J.,  want to know--
Now ie sti.
Doesn't it hurt to move?
Terribe.
Meet E Diabo.
We, if that don't beat a.
You want a itte sugar, don't you?
-Where'd you ever get a critter ike that?
-Caros found him.
Must have been in a god mine,
because that's what he is. Soid god.
t took a whie to train him, but now
he's about ready for his debut.
We, what's the act?
We strap a patform onto Omar's back,
and E Diabo watzes on top.
A horse dancing on horseback.
That's gonna be a humdinger.
can see it a now. Presenting E Diabo,
the word's one and ony miniature horse.
We are on our way to a fortune.
-Amazing.
-t's absoutey astounding.
Yeah, it was those three toes
that started me thinking.
And four on its hind feet.
-Great Scott, it coud be-
-Yeah, an Eo-- What's it?
-Hippus.
-Eohippus. Yes.
Eohippus, if you are one...
...what are you doing here over 50 miion
years after you shoud be extinct?
t coud be a freak of nature, of course.
We, is there any way you can te?
By checking its origin.
f  coud prove that this
is the genuine artice...
... sha undoubtedy
receive a knighthood...
...for the greatest scientific
discovery of the age.
The greatest scientific discovery
of the age?
-T.J. doesn't know what she's got hersef.
-Sir Horace Bromey.
t' ook great in ights.
-Gaieo, Newton, Darwin, Bromey.
-Buffao Bi, Barnum and Baiey.
-Bromey.
-Or the Ringing Brothers.
Yes. Yes. We' pay one off
against the other.
-Se to the highest bidder. Make them beg.
-Possiby Lord...
-We'd make a kiing.
-...Bromey.
We must find out where
this itte horse came from.
Yes, et's go find this guy Caros.
-mpossibe.
-But my dear feow...
... have no commercia interest
in E Diabo. 'm a scientist.
don't care what you are.
T.J. has given away our secret.
-Destroying a my dreams.
-Oh, come now, be reasonabe.
Reason is something my peope
do not understand.
That witch Tia Zorina tes them
superstitious nonsense about E Diabo.
-They beieve it.
-At east show us the camp.
don't want any more troube.
You've caused enough aready.
-We, thanks for your hep, Caros.
-What hep?
''Tia Zorina. Camp.''
We can sure find where that camp is.
-How?
-Why, Lope.
-Lope?
-Sure. Listen, that kid...
...coud find a neede in a haystack
and se it for a profit. 'm not kidding.
Madam, 'm prepared to pay
a guide handsomey.
To ead you to the Forbidden Vaey?
No. Not for a the god in the word.
-What's this Forbidden Vaey?
-From there came the itte horse...
...and unti he is returned,
a great evi wi fa upon us.
-Rubbish!
- te you, uness the itte horse...
...is returned, we sha a
suffer the curse of he.
Superstitious captrap. There's nothing
hocus-pocus about that itte horse.
Don't you reaize we've discovered
a iving specimen of the Eohippus?
-What, that thing reay is an Eohippus?
-Of course.
We, naturay we sha have
to prove it by scientific research.
We, we aren't getting any scientific
research done here, are we, professor?
f you can't hep me,
perhaps  can hep you.
f you knew where the itte horse
was hidden, what woud you do?
Return it to the Forbidden Vaey.
We....
A centavo for your thoughts, senor.
Oh, hi, Lope.
You ook unhappy, senor.
We,  got a probem, Lope.
've been wresting with it for hours.
Sometimes it heps to te an amigo.
We, it's ike this, amigo:
made a big discovery ast night.
f  te this friend about it,
it coud hep her a ot.
She coud make a fortune.
But if she makes a fortune
it might not hep me.
can't figure out why 'm trying
to hep a friend make a fortune...
...when a  gotta do is be quiet
about it and make a fortune mysef.
-Savvy?
- savvy very we, senor.
- can't understand it.
-Love.
No! Love's for Latins.
When my mama was aive
she used to te me:
''Lope, when you hep someone
you ove you hep yoursef.''
Here, limonada, for free advice.
You sure do know how
to hep yoursef, Lope.
What's the big discovery, senor?
Oh, no, no, no.
You' end up wanting a cut.
Why? 'm doing fine on my own.
Yeah,  see, and widening your horizons.
-Sorry, senor?
- mean, you're going on a journey.
-With the professor.
-With the professor?
must meet him tonight with the mue,
outside the arena.
We, that's it, amigo.
No more figuring.
got the feeing that certain friend of mine
is in need of some hep right now.
Come on, come on!
-Hey, Tuck!
-Tuck, what's the hurry?
Lope, come here.
We are in uck, chico.
They've got it.
Kirby, et them go! Don't be a foo, man!
Come on, chico,
we mustn't ose them.
What happened?
-He hit me.
-Who?
-Your friend, Kirby.
-What?
caught him with my peope
steaing E Diabo.
-Steaing?! Why, the dirty--
-No, no. Not Tuck.
-We just saw him with our own eyes.
-He's no good, T.J.
Champ, get Bean and Rowdy.
You bet.
Whoa!
Come on!
Look here.
Tuck's got company.
We're headed in the right direction.
He's working with the professor.
They were speaking of scientific interest.
Scientific interest, my eye!
Tuck wants E Diabo for Buffao Bi.
-You shoud have istened to me, T.J.
-He's right, T.J.
That Tuck is the owest.
A right, a right!
He was right.  was wrong.
-But if we stand here we' never catch him.
- know where they're heading.
-There's a shortcut.
-To where?
Forbidden Vaey.
Hep!
Now, professor,
where's that itte horse?
- don't know.
-You don't know?
Sir Horace, when your king finds out
you're a ow-down horse thief...
...he' give you a touch of the sword,
a right. Yeah, just about there.
You're gonna te me where E Diabo is.
You can make it easy or hard.
That's up to you.
-We, the gypsies took him.
-You put them up to it.
We, yes, in a way,
but it's going to benefit a of us.
Oh, now, is that a fact?
-E Diabo--
-s the property of Miss T.J. Breckenridge!
'm protecting her interests.
We, so am .
Don't you see, we must foow
the gypsy trai to the Forbidden Vaey.
Where there is one Eohippus,
there must be others.
At east two, the sire and the mare.
Possiby more.
Just think what you
and Miss Breckenridge coud do...
...with a dozen Eohippi.
From now on we're partners?
Oh, no, professor.  make it a rue never
to shake hands with an anxious man.
' join you, but no deas.
-Senor Kirby!
-Hey, hi there, Lope.
Say, what's the price of water
around here?
-One peso. To you, haf.
-Okay.
Fy, itte one. Fy home to your master.
This circe of mountains,
jagged peaks, deep ciffs...
...coud be the perfect barrier
against man and the eements.
Huh, no wonder they ca it
the Forbidden Vaey.
Yes.
Might be the answer to many things.
Like what?
We sha soon see, Mr. Kirby.
We' camp here tonight,
start out first thing in the morning.
What's that?
Quick, the horses!
-Where's Rosita?
-Senor Kirby, professor, ook!
There's bood a around.
Ho! Ho, boy, ho!
Yeah, the gypsies stopped here,
et E Diabo run off that way.
Senor Kirby! Professor!
Now, how'd they get here?
was afraid of something ike this.
Champ,  just caught mysef
a horse thief.
Now hod on, T.J. You don't think
had anything to do with that?
Look, the Eohippus!
Easy. Easy. Steady.
No, that's no good.
Let's chase him on horseback.
Go get him.
-Hey, need any hep?
-Not from you.
-'ve got it!
-Take your thieving hands off him.
He's mine.
Whatever you say, T.J.
Tuck Kirby,  coud shoot you.
Keep after him, Champ.
Hey, we got him cornered.
The devi we have.
can see dayight in there.
He must have gone cear through.
-Yeah, we, that's that because we're not.
-Looks ike the end of the road.
t opens into another whoe vaey
through there.
Wider inside. Wide enough
for the horses.
Take up the sack easy.
Take her away.
Okay, that did it!
Come on, boys.
Now, ain't that something?!
Man, oh, man!
Champ!
Whoa. Here, what's this?
- never saw tracks ike that.
-Hey, Champ!
Do you see what  see?
Hoy-- What's that?
t ooks ike a pucked ostrich!
Let's get him for the show.
What the--?
-'m gonna try and find the others.
-Right.
-t's hideous.
-Oh, it's beautifu.
-What kind of bird is it, professor?
-Oh, no bird.
A giant pterodacty, a fying reptie.
t's been extinct
for over 50 miion years.
Then what's it doing here?
Precisey.
What is it doing here?
-Where are the others?
-There!
Let's get out of here!
Gwangi.
-Take off, T.J.
-Lope's hurt.
Can you ride? Get on a horse, boy!
-Come on, professor. No time for that.
- can't go now.
There's a big izard back there,
heading this way. Get aboard.
Leave me aone, Mr. Kirby.
'm not eaving now.
Come on, Tuck.
Okay, professor, it's your funera.
Great Scott!
see what you mean, Mr. Kirby.
By George! A styracosaurus!
Whoa!
A right, Champ, take a ook.
Okay up here. Room for the horses
and everything.
-Let's get up there.
-What about the professor?
Nothing we can do for him now.
Just hope he's sti aive.
Rowdy, you must be pumb loco.
-Now what'd  do?
-Come here.
These cartridges are banks.
They're the banks we use in the show.
No wonder the rifes didn't do any good.
How was  to know? You expect
to wake a fea ready for a shootout?
Hey, forget it.
Here, maybe we can use these.
-See if you can cut that into a spear.
- don't take orders from no horse thief.
A right, now te me, just what
do you mean, a horse thief?
A right, break it up.
That's enough.
We' sette a this ater.
No, we' sette it right now. Lope?
t was the professor and the gypsies.
Caros said you did it.
Caros?
You never did bring anything
but troube to T.J. A right.
Stop it! Where do you think you are,
civiization?
We a got to stick together
unti we get out of this.
n a my traves  never saw
nothing ike that 2-ton izard.
f we coud just get him back aive.
Yeah, the ony thing  want
to get back aive is me.
That does it.
What are you doing out of the cave?
You wanna get yoursef kied?
Not anymore.
-What's that for?
-We, it's a trap.
n case one of those itte izards
decides to mosey up this way.
A hoe in the ground
coud swaow me up too.
You can't te a friend from an enemy,
cockeyed femae.
Don't they seep nights?
Come on! Come on!
-t's gone.
-Yeah, temporariy.
Tuck, 've decided.
'm going to se out.
We, that's great,
if we ever get back to Omar.
Not just Omar. The whoe show,
ock, stock and barre.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
-We, sure, sure.
-Oh, sound happier.
We,  don't know, T.J.
've been on my own so ong.
've been on my own too.
We,  know,  know, but not ike me.
mean, reay on my own.
've had to con and pitch,
huste my way into whatever  am now.
don't even know where that is.
Tuck,  don't care.
Don't you understand?
A right.
A right, T.J.
' te you. 've been ooking
for something...
-...a my ife.
-Yes?
t took a ot of finding,

-Yes?
-The most beautifu...

-Ranch?
-Yeah, in Wyoming.
Don't you see, we coud
both se out, buy the pace...
...buid it up to a reay big ranch,
raise a bunch of catte and horses.
And kids, maybe?
Yeah!
You taking about setting down?
Sure you can make it, Tuck?
We,  won't know
ti  give it a try, wi ?
Bean, Rowdy, bring torches! t worked!
say up there, watch your step.
There seems to be a bit of a drop here.
need some water before we set out.
Be right back.
-You shoudn't have et him go aone.
-His idea.
Come on!
Bean! Rowdy!
Get spears! Get spears!
Get the horses!
Bean, Rowdy, sadde up!
Got him!
Go to the other side!
Pu on the rope! Pu!
Pu that rope!
Go on, get cear!
Get cear!
Pu that rope! Get cear!
Pu on that rope! A the way!
Pu it!
Get another rope on him!
Pu that rope!
Hod on!
Another rope shoud do it!
Hod it steady!
Hod him! Hod him!
They've got him, professor!
They've got him!
Steady now, steady!
Keep the ropes tight!
Keep them tight!
Come on, professor!
Come on!
The ropes, keep them tight!
A right, cear out! Let go!
Rowdy, come on!
Steady those horses!
Can't get through!
Keep those horses steady!
Tuck, Caros!
Can't get through here!
Go back to the professor.
There's no way through!
There's no way through!
We gotta go back!
We're gonna ug this critter back aive!
T.J., honey, you're gonna have the greatest
main attraction that any circus--
What's the matter?
Where's Caros?
Champ!
t is as  foretod.
Gwangi has kied Caros
just as he kied his brother Migue.
-We, how'd you know that?
-n a dream,  saw it.
The great jaws snapping,
the rideress horse. He was doomed.
And so wi you be doomed,
a of you...
...uness the evi one is set free!
Baderdash, my good woman, baderdash!
He's no more evi than an aigator.
The ony thing that's evi about him
are his jaws.
Spes? He can cast no spes!
A right, come on, et's move out.
Defy the aw and perish!
n the name of word science,
beg you,  impore you, to think again.
-Later. We've got a show to put on.
-A show! A show?
But it's disgracefu to think of putting
this creature on dispay in a cheap circus!
-We can do what we ike. He's our property.
-He beongs to us a, to mankind.
-To scientific research!
-Easy, professor.
You can do your research in the time
we give you. Foow us on our word tour!
You must be mad, raving mad.
Word tour!
We' see what the Roya Society
has to say about this.
-What's this about a word tour?
-'ve got it a figured out.
-We pay London, Paris, Madrid, and--
-Wait a minute.
