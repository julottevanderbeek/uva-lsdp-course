Legend goes
that somewhere beneath
these mountains lies
a gateway
between heaven and hell.
It is said
that a sacred sisterhood
guards this portal
and the power of their prayers
keeps the damned
from tormenting the living.
Trouble with the damned is
they never stay put.
My son.
We'll make a man
of him, eh, Red?
- What's wrong with ya?
-
- Be a man!
-
Man:
Good to see you again.
Where is he?
Boss is careful
where he goes.
We've had
a little trouble.
Why so many horses?
Boss sent Red and me.
And now there's just me.
Like I've-- like I've said,
we've had a little trouble.
You brought
two too many.
Man:
I didn't bring that one.
You remember me.
-
-
Where is he?
He did not come.
Still he eludes you.
-
-
God's not gonna save ya.
I was to meet him here.
I know nothing more.
Most times when you bring
a man to justice,
the axe swings,
the noose tightens.
That's it.
Out here,
they come back...
Harder to kill.
The way I finish them--
rip out their heads.
As for these men...
Target practice.
Man:
Might I say that among
my many miracles
And holy relics,
I do carry certain
apothecary notes.
In these forbidding parts,
I sense a woman
is a rarity,
which means
a man must improvise.
What piece of you
can I buy for a dollar?
My pity.
I was being kind.
I like my men
heartless.
Man #2:
Get back to your post.
Well...
- That was clever.
-
Fancy bitch.
You a thief?
You don't look
like a thief.
I'm a dancer.
So where'd you learn
a trick like that?
Ballet school.
You know if you cross
his path again,
he's liable to kill you.
Death ain't the worst thing
that can happen to you.
You ever heard
of the Gallowwalkers?
-
-
This special tonic
will cure all ailments...
-
- ...And keep the undead
at bay.
Man #2:
Dang priest!
All right, the wagon's here!
Get 'em all up!
- Move!
- Go on!
- Whore, get up.
- Get in line!
- Line up, boys!
- Move! Move it!
- Okay, go on! Move!
- Go on, get up!
Go on, you piece of shit.
- Move your sorry ass.
- Go on!
- Go on, get in there!
-
- Woman: Oh!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
What's a girl
gotta do to get
rescued around here?
Hyah.
- Man: You that good or was
that a lucky shot?
- Lucky for you.
- Man: So now I owe you?
- Now you owe me.
Hup.
- Man: You got
a job in mind?
- Yes.
Priest: Sir...
Do you know
where we are bound?
Enoch's hammer.
Priest:
Sounds like a church town,
a place of tolerance.
They will look kindly
on one of their own.
Yeah?
So cruelly treated,
so manifestly wronged.
You know this place?
I have family there.
Seven brothers
and sisters.
All in the same grave.
Whoa. Whoa there!
Man:
Brothers and sisters
of Enoch's hammer,
eternally pure of heart,
We have gathered here
to bear witness
to god's justice
on the wicked
and the damned.
Bow now
your golden heads
and pray for their souls.
- Get out.
Come on. Come on.
- Get down.
- Hyah!
-
- Git!
- Get up, boy.
- Get off.
- Come on, you.
- Git!
- Come on, little lady.
- Get up. Git!
- Woman: Oh. Oh!
Welcome, pilgrims.
I do not
call you prisoners...
Nor do
I call these gallows.
These are the gates
of your salvation.
For this sacrifice,
God has chosen you
as the lamb,
just as he chose me
to help
these righteous people
spread justice
across the land.
I was once a sinner.
Dancer:
Damn right you were,
Cherry Gaza,
Y'all virgin eater.
You whore of Babylon.
You painted cat.
You womb of vipers!
The smell of Jezebel
has no power
over me now.
When I saw the devil
rise up from his grave...
Priest:
Sir, to whom do we
plead our case?
- St. Peter!
- You cannot hang us
without a trial.
I can...
And I will!
You've already been judged
and found wanting
in the eyes of the lord!
It is through his mercy
that he's brought you here
to be cleansed by the rope,
just as he cleansed me
when I saw the devil
rise from the dust!
I'll be needing a shirt.
We've only got
one color, sir.
Can't go wrong
with white.
I'll do my best, sir.
We keep more
out the back.
Kiss cut.
And you must be...?
What do you think?
Is it me?
- How many?
- Five.
Hmm.
All right, stranger,
I'm gonna
have to see your face.
-
-
The cuffs are a little long.
Bring 'em in.
-
-
Ooh!
And hell came forth
with chains and whips,
the horsemen
of the apocalypse.
Whoa.
I'm not taking
another step until you
give me some answers.
I'm standing right here.
You see this?
My fucking hands hurt.
Hey.
Put it on.
Tsk tsk tsk.
-
-
-
-
-
-
Any good
with your left?
Aman:
Half now.
Half when you've
finished the job.
How many more?
It doesn't matter.
It only matters
if it's too many for you.
You gonna give me
some answers about
those things?
Aman:
Now that's starting a story
at the end.
It begins with a whore.
She's with child
when the mines dry up,
so she becomes a thief.
But not very good.
She's headed
for the gallows
when the sisters
of San Diablo find her.
They take her in
and teach her the secrets
of the dead.
When the boy child is born,
they tell her,
"you must give him up.
The gateway
to hell is no place
to raise a child."
So she sends him
to an orphanage,
and there he grows
and grows and grows
until the clock
strikes 12:00.
And then they tell him,
"you're a man.
You must leave."
But where?
A widow woman meets him,
likes him,
takes him in.
She's the mistress
of a slaughterhouse.
She teaches him a trade,
puts food on the table,
loves him...
And raises him
with her daughter.
Aha.
Beautiful daughter.
He grows to love
the daughter.
Oh!
Aman:
She is his to protect.
One sunrise
she tells him,
"go with mother
to sell the skins.
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself."
He leaves her.
Five men ride by.
- They find her alone.
-
- Go on!
-
- Aman: And they
make use of her.
-
You bitch!
She keeps it secret
until she can no more,
for now she is with child.
She begs him--
forgive her,
forget what
has happened to her
for the sake
of the unborn.
She says
the men are gone
and to her
they mean nothing.
But not to him.
No.
For one of them
grows inside of her.
Unbearable.
So for a second time
he leaves.
For the next five years,
he remembers nothing...
But the pain
of not being by her side.
He returns
to find her dead.
She died giving...
Birth to that child.
They took from him
the thing he loved most.
Those who were responsible...
Would pay.
-
-
Troy.
Son.
Get ready.
The boys are
sending someone.
We're getting out of here.
He's here, my darling.
I always hated
that bitch.
- Please, senor. Amigo!
-
Come on, get us out!
Get us out of here!
Who are you?
Her name...
- was Sueno.
-
-
-
- You're late.
- Well...
There was some
that needed convincing...
This was a good idea.
A bottle of beer
is a good idea.
Wearing a hat in the rain
is a good idea.
This... Is genius.
- Hey!
- Oh!
Shut the hell up, bitch.
You touch me
and you're dead!
Compelling argument.
You must be a lawyer.
She's a whore.
Mmm.
An easy mistake.
- I apologize.
-
-
-
-
- Shh.
-
- Ah! Ah.
Hmm.
Good texture.
-
-
Tough yet soft.
-
-
You'll fit in well.
I'm looking
for the right girl...
For my boy.
You freak!
Mmm. I get that a lot.
It doesn't stop it
hurting though.
Hmm?
- God have mercy!
-
We die, we come back
and you call us...
Gallowwalkers.
Well, if it's
good enough for jesus,
it should be
good enough for us.
It's a goddamn miracle,
ain't it?
It happens,
but no one knows
who or how or why.
No one knows.
And here's the thing...
I get shot.
My son gets shot.
Three of my men get shot.
The son of a bitch
even shoots my whore.
I come back.
My men come back.
Even my fucking whore
comes back.
But with my son,
death persists!
Life's little mystery.
Does anyone here know
where I might find
the sisters of San Diablo...
-
- ...In the mountain
of resurrection?
Hmm?
No.
Clear.
-
-
-
-
Ah!
You sleep now.
Eat if you're hungry.
How much time I got?
To sleep, to eat
or to live?
Who is he?
First I could find.
What happened?
They know who I am.
So now they will come.
You bring this boy
because you think I cannot
fight at your side?
I can fight.
You know I can fight.
Did one see your face?
It was a mistake.
You don't make mistakes.
Perhaps you want him
to come.
Perhaps you want him
to know who hunts him.
You want him to come...
To finish it,
here where it all began.
You gotta shave?
- I got no beard.
- Me neither.
Wanna play a game?
No, I don't.
Wanna throw shots
for money?
Yes, I do.
My turn.
-
-
Damn it!
One dollar and we never talk
of this day again.
I never knew my mother,
but I can sense
that she was always there.
As for Sueno,
She was my everything.
My friend,
my lover...
The memory
that I lived for.
Fabulos:
So where you want me?
Just get in the shed.
You're gonna need this.
There's--
There's really nothing
coming that we won't see.
Well, you didn't see that.
Oh jes--
Okay. Okay.
All right.
You win.
Okay, so back
at the skinning shed,
two guns,
shoot 'em in the head.
Anything else?
Okay.
Ah.
Oh, you look good, boss.
He was young.
-
- Eh.
Uh, what you think
of mine, boss?
Oh, it's-- it's not pretty,
but it stands up
to the sun, huh?
Oh, they may laugh,
but you don't see me
hiding in a hood, huh?
Shriveling
like beef jerky.
They need skinning again
in a week.
But me, I get
a good month wear of this.
And I think a lizard skin
is a good look for me.
Suit yourself.
All the more flesh
for us.
-
-
Eh. Boss?
If I do a good job,
can I have her lips?
Kansa:
Yes, you can.
You do a bad job
and I'll sew her lips
onto your face myself,
and that will come
with a beard.
Man:
Priest.
About time.
I've been dying
for this.
Man: Girl.
Take her.
Forgive me, father,
for I have skinned.
- Mosca!
- Mosca: Ah yes, boss, I come.
-  Oh no.
-
Sit still, no?
Oh, you hiding something
from me. You hide, huh?
I find it. I find it.
Now where is it?!
Ah! Ah.
Tell me that's it.
Let me see.
Yes, boss. It's what
we've been looking for.
It's the map
to skull mountain.
It's ours now, yeah?
Hey.
And so it came to pass
in a time when popes
made pacts with pagan lords,
the sisters of San Diablo
had forced upon them
a most cursed devotion...
One that no other sisterhood
could endure.
The passion
of their prayer
would become the power
that keeps the damned
from walking the earth.
And so into their hands
passed the ancient secrets
of what divides
the living from the dead.
Where are they,
chicken bones?
Where do they hide?
Does the rest of him
arrive monthly?
Man:
We had a little trouble.
I got shot.
I got shot bad, boss.
He's back.
You know him?
You never forget
the man who kills you
for the first time.
The first time is
always special.
Skullbucket,
take the rest of the men,
find the gunman.
Kill him and anyone
that's with him.
- Hey. Hey hey. Hey.
- Oh!
You gotta
sober up, ma'am.
- Uh...
- All right?
It could be today.
What did he tell you, kid?
He told you nothing.
Look, it's five men--
He has killed them once,
now he must
kill them again.
I need dunking.
You know, he's got
the one thing...
That a gunman needs
to be great.
A reason to live.
Now.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Come on, come on.
-
-
You're okay, kid.
Aman!
Aman!
Kids.
You saved me.
I never wanna see
that thing again.
Who are you
looking for?
The one that didn't come.
Where is he?
I'll find him.
I guess we made it.
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
-
-
You killed me.
Why the fuck
did you shoot me?!
You would've bled
to death.
A man might take the news
of his own death
badly.
I felt for the kid.
I really did,
but I couldn't just
leave him to die.
Me? I had
unfinished business
at the place
of my own resurrection.
I figured
if I ever made it back,
I would tell him
about the time
when I died.
It was over.
My death meant nothing.
But to my mother,
it was everything.
Let him live.
He's my only son.
And I'll stay here
as your servant.
Devil:
Oh, my price is a little
higher than that.
He is one of mine now.
He has blood
on his hands.
My deal is this:
When he is resurrected,
so too will all those
slain by his hand.
Now you must pay.
and so I awoke beneath
that mountain
where my mother had
sacrificed her life for mine,
whilst out there
the damned were stirring.
Fine flesh.
Not as fair as I would wish,
but you'll fit in well.
What breed was
your mother?
She was scottish.
Those Celts have a luster.
And your father--
was he pale-skinned?
Pale?
He was invisible.
Well, I'll soon have
my boy again,
- once we patch him up with
that fine skin of yours.
-
At last, the entrance.
Mosca, bring my boy.
Kiss cut, are you
my whore or what?
Boss! Boss!
Ah...
You see this, boss?
It's called the Aumenta.
It means
"the land of the dead."
Huh?
You don't take
that path, boss.
But this one, boss,
is called
"the Uroborus
at the pinnacle."
It means resurrection
shall be found
at the mountaintop.
This is the path, boss.
I certain.
Stay here.
-
- Bring my boy.
Mosca, you know this coat
of mine you like so much?
You just earned it.
Ohh. Thank you, boss.
Thank you!
Me, I like the cuffs.
I blew you a kiss...
And you blew me away.
I had no choice.
So choose now.
Knives or guns?
Guns.
Guns it is.
Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk.
I don't sleep.
But if I did...
One thought
would keep me from it.
"Why did my son
not return?"
You brought death
to every one of us.
So tell me.
No no no no no
no no no no.
You any good
with your left?
I thought
you wanted me dead.
Fabulos:
Yeah well, dead ain't
what it used to be.
All this over
one petty piece
of pussy.
He took his own life.
My boy!
My son!
I'm a woman
in need of rescue.
What kind of man are you?
I'm the heartless kind.
Hey, come on.
I don't know how to be dead.
No one taught you
how to live.
