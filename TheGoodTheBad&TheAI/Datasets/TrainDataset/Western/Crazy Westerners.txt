On the ground!
Goodbye, friend!
We are rich, boys!
The suffering is over!
Well said, Jessie Joe!
You'll finish suffering...
forever!
I have it...
Stop!
I see you've put flowers
in your guns.
Iâ€™ll place them
on your graves.
Lower your holsters!
Move!
Good.
Now, turn around!
And what do you want?
- Can I pass?
- I'm busy here, go away.
Well then let me help you...
Start by moving back,
there will be some fireworks.
I love parties!
It won't be a real party,
but it'll be just as enjoyable.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey Mr., yes you!
Come over here.
Come here.
Wait a moment.
Look there!
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye and rest in peace!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome my dear.
On that wagon is a dying man,
I believe he might interest you.
- Who is it?
- I don't know, haven't asked.
Francis Fitzgerald Grotz
found him like this!
Must be escorting the gold.
And who's this
Francis Fitzgerald Grotz?
I am... I come from an unknown father
and a mother who was notorious!
Her name was Sandy Miles,
the sweetest morsel of the West!
And you'd be the
gold's guide?
Yes.
- Who are you?
- Little Rita.
The famous gunfighter of the West?!
Yep.
What luck!
An honor to meet you!
Let us rejoice!
Take me away with you?
- Okay!
- Little Rita, thank you.
This is a nice way to die...
- What do we do with him?
- Throw him with the rest of the bodies!
Honor to you, Sitting Bison.
Augh, Little Rita.
A joy to see you again,
Big Little Rita.
And a pleasure to see you again,
Sweet Apple of the Sky, daughter of
great Chief Sitting Bison.
Three days and three nights,
I worried for you.
For three days and three nights,
I prayed to the gods.
I heard you were attacked
by one hundred bandits?
Eight...
And all eight...
dead?!
I made a nice catch,
two cases full of gold!
Two cases?
And where are they?
There, in the wagon.
- Who is this?
- Francis Fitzgerald Grotz, my friend.
- Pleased to meet you, Sir Francis.
- Hi.
- Where are the cases of gold?
- Back there.
How disgusting...
gold is despicable!
- You agree, Sir Francis?
- Dear Bison, you must be exaggerating!
I wish I could have both cases!
I say something wrong?
Another part of this metal...
was taken back
from evil men.
A day not far from now,
Little Rita
...and I will forever destroy
all the cursed gold...
expelled from the bowels of the earth!
Only afterwards
will we live in peace!
May the gods protect you,
Little Rita.
By the next moon we will destroy
all the gold gathered these years.
- Why not now?
- Some is missing... Ringo and Django.
You'll be killed.
Their guns howl like hyenas...
...and shoot faster than the wind.
There have been many who tried
to kill those two.
Now their bodies inhabit
all the cemeteries of the West.
I'm afraid that is
too great a risk for you.
And that worries me...
But if there's one ounce of gold left,
that means all the work was in vain!
Have you thought that men
will mine more gold...
...and so there will be other wars,
and the kingdom of evil will return?
Destruction of that gold
will be up to others.
What others?
Those who come after me,
they will believe and feel as I do.
Remember Little Rita,
your fate is sealed.
The night will see a red star
bright in the sky...
and you will return to nothing,
because of nothing you came.
You are but a story,
a beautiful legend... and nothing more.
Okay... but now
there's the gold.
It's empty!
"Thanks a lot"
...Ringo!
The village is deserted,
as usual!
You better be the next one
to change tracks.
It will be done, sir.
Thank you!
You are?
- Where are you from?
- From where I left...
Give me the guns...
in this village you can
not walk around armed.
All the same! When I ask for their pistol,
they all respond like that!
With a stupid smile like...
...forgive me, stranger.
I'm the law here
and nobody listens to me!
Sometimes I think that I...
just have the wrong job, understand?
I get nervous and
I feel like I'm about to explode!
Where's Zoco?
- Who's Zoco?
- Where is he?!
He's playing cards in the saloon,
but there's four of them armed!
- What are you planning?
- Guess.
- High noon shootout?
- Yes.
Off by five minutes,
you're early?
My name is Ringo,
I'm never early or late.
Ringo?
The super-bounty-killer?!
Be right back.
- Zoco, we need to talk.
- Start again.
Always one remaining!
Of course, there's an odd one!
- Zoco, come here for a minute.
- Shut up.
Divide again.
There's always one!
I'm the boss
so I'll take it.
Guys, easy now!
With the remaining dollar
we'll pay for a drink!
Out.
Damn! This is what I was
trying to warn you about!
Ringo, don't make too much noise
my nerves will explode...
Twelve sharp.
I'll prepare the coffins.
Play!
- What are you after, Ringo?
- The stolen gold, my half.
We decided to keep it for ourselves.
Bad, very bad.
There is a psalm that says:
Greed leads to death.
One to remember when
the day of reckoning comes.
- That day has arrived.
- For me or for you?
Do not waste time, pray.
Give me a drink.
No alcohol for minors;
Milk or Coca-Cola, choose.
I want a whiskey.
Don't make me lose my patience,
boy.
I ordinarily only
say it once.
For me that's too much.
Do not play with my glasses,
boy!
And you, don't play smart,
I know that wasn't whiskey.
I don't like it.
My doctor advised me
to leave the life here!
Go up to the sheriff
and tell him we're missing one.
- One what?
- A coffin...
...for Ringo.
Allow me, sheriff?
Can I give you some wise advice?
I'm wise as is,
but say it anyway.
- Prepare another coffin.
- Well if your health is that bad...
- It's not for me!
- Then for Whom?
- Ringo?
- Him.
He's healthy as a bull!
I've seen many die
with the health of two bulls.
You mean someone's gonna kill...
who?
Hello, sheriff.
Your grandson is past his bedtime,
take him to sleep.
Hello, Ringo.
- - What are you looking for?
- The gold that you've got.
One man just
tried before you.
Now his wife is a widow.
I have no wife.
That's it?
Everything I have done
in my life
I did for a fistfull of dollars.
I believe you also did
for a few dollars more...
Grotz, put the money in a safe place.
- This isn't the end.
- Yes, it won't end like this!
Get up... and go!
Serves you right, damn thief!
Go! If I see you
in my town again...
We'll meet again.
When you're tired of living,
call me!
The gun has long-range
we can only pray now!
- How many meters away is that?
- Seventy.
With this one...
it'll fix him for good.
Hi, great Chief Sitting Bison.
Augh, Big Little Rita
how was it?
Well, I had an exchange
of views with Ringo.
He was convinced to return the gold.
- Was it difficult?
- It was a cinch.
Now he is in heaven
among the angels.
You are a devil,
an Archfiend!
- Chief!
- What? Speak, hurry up!
He stole the...
...stole the gold
the stagecoach,
was robbed by...
Django...
Now it'll be settled...
where is he now?
You must know that Django is
a nomadic one. Moving continuously.
The last smoke signals
informed that yesterday morning
he was in the mountains of Tucson.
- Then I'll head for Tucson.
- Oh, Little Rita.
Do not worry.
I'll go and circle right back.
- Hello.
- Hello.
This the way to Tucson?
Yes, but if you're digging a grave
you can dig it here!
- You're funny, boy.
- I'm not a boy.
Well for a man,
you don't look very mature!
And you, a gravedigger...
talk too much!
Get out of the way, let me pass.
- If I don't?
- Do not tease me child.
I have no time to lose.
I am Little Rita.
And I am Django.
Don't move.
They were right to say you are
the biggest pain in the West!
Get up.
You know what I want:
the gold, the gold that was in the stagecoach.
I've made some effort for that gold.
Mexicans broke my
hands with their horses.
Where's the gold?
- Go away.
- It doesn't end here.
A friend of yours
told me the same thing.
It went bad,
very bad.
Go!
- It's a gun!
- Yeah.
He's not a gravedigger,
but an arms dealer!
- Come on, let's get the gold.
- Where can we put it?
The saddlebags.
You were wasteful,
not leaving any bullets.
Does your courage
lie in that armor?
- I'll take off...
- I have no bullets!
I'll turn around,
after all I am a girl!
Shouldn't have done that, Django.
I'm sorry.
Please, Little Rita,
let me die like the Americans.
The Americans?
What do you mean?
I want to tell you my life story.
No, I don't have the time!
The Indians and the Japanese
die quick...
but I'm a gunslinger...
a famous gunfighter.
I'm entitled to two minutes of agony
before dying.
Alright! Talk!
When I was... a child...
I could not bear my father,
but adored my mother...
What a magnificent sight
the herds of buffalo are!
Those are cows!
Four thin cows...
And a wild horse!
- Hello, folks!
- Hi!
My name is Black Star,
I'm looking to sell my cattle.
- Where is the closest water souce?
- About two miles.
- Where you from?
- Far away.
- And where you going?
- Far.
Now it's clear!
Have a nice trip.
- Did you see his eyes?
- I saw them.
You didn't take your eyes off him,
you were like an owl!
I'm so happy,
I'm going to scream!
Go ahead, we're in the country!
He's beautiful!
He's so beautiful!
The herdsman is so good-looking!
I'm happy, Grotz!
Women are all the same!
One glance
and they're electrocuted!
I love him! I love him!
I don't understand them!
Who you are? What do you want?
Lucrecio! Emilio! Get him!
The girl we'll take later.
Let me go, damn yokels!
- You've decided to talk?
- No!
What's happening?
Well, when the Mexicans hear the name of
their leader, they immediately start partying.
So you want to talk or not?
Walk!
- Sit!
- Leave us alone.
- So you were convinced?
- Yes.
You'll tell the truth?
I always hear of gold
at the camp of Sitting Bison...
and they hide it in a cave.
Tell me how I can get
in there secretly...
and you'll save your life!
Thank you, Sancho.
When you have finished drinking
this flask
...if you have not yet spoken
...with a hot iron, I'll put my signature
on your face!
But you don't know how to write!
- Speak!
- You know the Indian camp?
- Yes.
- On the hill is a cave.
- In front is a door.
- Sure!
- The door opens with a magic word.
- A magic word?
- Cintauaua.
- Cintauaua? And what happens?
- In there is gold!
- Sancho's gold!
Viva Sancho!
You were saying
that there is a cave...
...with a door and then you say
the magic word:
Cintauaua!
And after?
Inside is gold!
- There is gold!
- Sancho's gold!
What are you doing here?
I saw your capture
from afar...
and I waited for the right moment
to free you.
Thank you.
Hurry, please!
Bravo!
- The gun!
- Here it is.
Follow me!
Go!
Honor to you, Sitting Bison.
Augh, Little Rita. Welcome back.
I heard you did not
show kindness with Django.
I gave him the privilege
to inaugurate a new cemetery.
- This one of your prisoners?
- No, this is my friend.
Saved me from certain death.
His name is Black Star.
Pleased to meet you.
Friends of Rita, are friends of Sitting Bison.
- You will be our guest.
- Thank you, great Chief.
You love gold?
- No.
- Bravo.
- Our goal is to destroy it, is it not?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Why aren't you sleeping?
- I'm not sleepy.
- Are you sick? - I'm fine.
Tell me the truth...
you're in love, huh?
I confess, I'm in love.
Careful! I can not understand
that I do not know!
But as my mother said, Sandy Miles,
love is like a bullet...
it enters the heart
and ends up in your head!
- If you don't remove it, boom!
- How do I remove it?
With this.
As my mother said:
"Sing and it will pass."
Listen, and stop dreaming.
- Rita, wake up!
- What is it?
- What?
- Black Star is a dead man.
- He tried to steal the gold in the cave.
- Gold!
The Indians caught him
and soon... he will be scalped.
- That Scoundrel! Where is he now?
- Out with Sitting Bison.
Okay, let's go.
You shouldn't have done it.
Why not?
Calm down, Little Rita.
Black Star will pay for his crime.
I do not forget
that once you saved my life.
For this,
I grant you a favor.
Black Star, will be tried
by the pale faces.
A regular court will judge you.
If found innocent...
you will be free. But found guilty...
you'll be scalped!
Your honor,
the defendant here...
...it's true, tried to scratch
some of the gold, but who...
...who has never fallen
to such a temptation!
Silence! Silence!
Enough!
Your honor, I call
the mercy of this court
and the noble jury here today.
Defendant,
have you anything to declare?
Yes, your honor.
I am guilty.
I ruined everything!
We need the jury's verdict...
Are you deaf? Have you not heard
what the defendant said?
Guilty! The accused is guilty!
Silence!
Defendant Black Star, because
you're guilty we condemn you...
...to death.
Silence or I'll clear the room!
Since the crime was committed
in Indian territory...
the accused will be extradited there
and executed according to sentence.
The pale faces have given me the honor
to execute a death sentence.
But only after I have performed
the noble traditions of my people.
Ok, Bison!
For you to die,
we have different ways.
Chopped, sun-dried
hanging from a rope,
roasted, or drilled.
What does it mean to be ''drilled''?
Take a pot
full of red ants...
bury the subject
up to their neck...
and place the pot on his head.
Then imagine them,
drilling small holes...
tiny holes.
Can I choose?
Sorry Sir Black,
but that decision is for me.
You'll attend a ceremony
you've never seen before.
To kill or not kill...
that is the question.
Big Chief Sitting Bison,
on behalf of your affection
I ask you to save the life...
of this man.
Little Rita, all of this
madness for nothing?
- Why didn't you ask me before?
- Please, don't ask any questions.
It's a private matter.
Privacy is sacred for me
and for my people.
So I close my mouth,
your request is accepted.
Black Star will live.
Hello guys,
looking for something?
Go away, idiot! I am Sancho
and I come to rob the bank!
Don't be loud, it hurts!
I have a nervous disposition!
- Just don't be loud!
- Go! - Do not shout!
Do whatever you like,
but leave me alone!
Hello, sheriff!
- Give me a drink.
- I've finished everything, I'm sorry.
Don't you annoy me too!
Give me a drink!
The last two bottles,
he drank them.
Who?
It's Black Star!
But Blacky, shouldn't you
be dead at this hour?
She saved my life.
What man saved your life?
Tell me!
- I said she.
- Oh, she!
Who is she?
- Little Rita.
- Great, fantastic!
Let's drink to that!
It's not everyday that you're spared.
Why the funeral on your face?
Did you have a relative die?
Or maybe you've fallen in love
with that little pest?
Sorry, Blacky.
I didn't mean to offend you.
- What's happening? - Sancho, each month
he comes to rob the bank.
He comes and goes.
Prepare the coffins, sheriff.
Hello!
- The gun!
- Ok.
Now we'll have a little party!
Nice shooting, Black!
You were really good!
I wouldn't be able to do
such a thing, even drunk!
Now the bounties are yours.
I wish you a proposal.
Why not stay here with us?
You were fantastic,
you've liberated us from a nightmare!
- Thanks.
- We propose you as governor!
I can not deceive you.
It was not me, it was him!
Him?
Thank you, sir. You are a hero
and deserve a reward.
But I am a condemned man.
Who is the fool who condemned
a man like you to death?
Joseph, it was you.
It's true! Excuse me, Mr. Star,
I had not recognized!
However, that is water
under the bridge, right?
Gentlemen, I propose this
man be appointed sheriff.
I have been condemned
and I must die.
The Indians have not performed
their sentence.
Now it's up to you.
But hurry!
No later than tomorrow,
before sunset.
For now we will put
you in prison. Then we'll see.
Your hands, Black!
Do you think that's enough?
Three tons of dynamite are here
and thirty cases of TNT on top!
Think about the explosion!
That's right. Little more, eh?
Little Rita, my informant
tells me...
that Black Star
has made a heroic act.
He killed Sancho and saved
the money of the bank.
Good boy! I knew
he would change!
He has a generous heart,
that cowboy.
- He's not a cowboy!
- Sorry, little one.
Don't call me little!
Sorry, Big Rita.
I understand they also wanted him
as the sheriff, but he refused.
He said he was sentenced to death
and wants to be hanged...
tomorrow at sunset.
Idiot.
Little Rita!
It looks like you ran here!
Where is Black Star?
I thought you would show up.
He is sleeping in his cell.
You can't let him die,
I got rid of Ringo and Django!
Now I demand proof
of your gratitude.
It's not up to me,
he wants to die!
You can stop it!
How can I? It's impossible!
There is a court order!
He has proven himself an honest man
and deserves to live.
But what can I do?
Tonight we'll blow
up the mountain.
With all that gold?
But it's a crime!
I don't approve of it.
- Later, the village will have
a party, right? - Yes
We also invited
Sitting Bison, you'll come too?
Okay, I will.
But during the festival
you release Black Star.
Get him drunk,
throw him on a horse... off he goes!
You have quite the imagination,
but it is against the law!
All right, Sheriff,
you'll regret it!
One moment!
Hi, Little Rita.
I thought you said
he was in prison?
There he stands now!
He's a volunteer prisoner.
He can do whatever he wants!
I understand, there is
one too many of us.
Guess I'm the one?
I guess!
Why are you interested in me?
One day you saved my life.
And once you saved mine.
- This is the last time!
- Listen, is the last favor I ask.
I tried to steal
the gold because...
I was convinced that stealing and killing
was the only way of the West.
Now, I know it's not.
It was you that showed me...
there is something
more important than gold.
Maybe we wont see
each other again...
but I want you to know...
I love you.
It's time for the metal to be
returned back to the earth.
In a few moments
the mountain will blow...
and buried in its bowels,
the cursed gold...
that created evil
and corrupted men.
We pay tribute to the great
Little Rita
who allowed us to achieve
this great dream.
May the gods protect her life
and our people.
Sir Francis?
- Right ahead.
- With pleasure.
Less than 9...
Fire!
Rita, what are you doing?
Why didn't you enter the saloon?
It's my fate...
right, great leader?
On the night you see a red star
bright in the sky...
that night you will go away.
Farther than where you came from.
You are a legend, Little Rita,
a beautiful, impressive legend.
You come from nothing,
and there you shall return.
Farewell, great Chief.
Farewell, Grotz.
Goodbye, little one.
Where were you?
I searched everywhere!
What are you doing?
And where is Rita?
She's gone
and never coming back.
Gone?
Without telling me anything?
So suddenly.
Grotz, tell me now,
why and where she went!
She had to go back where
she came from. Far away.
I'll find her. I'll find her.
At the risk of looking
for the rest of my life.
And tracking night after day,
day after night.
As the sun chases the moon.
As the light chases the darkness.
As death after life.
The important thing here:
Is to always chase something...
with love. Yes, love.
