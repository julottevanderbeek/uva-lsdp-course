I'm sorry, penguin...
...but if you insist I'm going to have
to put a hole in your head.
And I'll have to choose
another target...
...there's already a cave
in place of your brain.
When we first met, the hole in
Vasco's head was even deeper.
At that time, he was
just a poor man.
One of the many wretched souls
living in Mexico when...
...Porfirio Diaz...
...was trying any thing to win the
presidency for the fifth time.
And his tactics weren't
always the friendliest.
- Who are you voting for?
- Porfirio Diaz.
Ricardo Vuelta.
- Who are you voting for?
- I vote against Diaz.
Take him to the wall!
Dad!
Platoon! Load arms!
Aim!
Fire!
And who are you voting for?
Who could a guy
like me vote for?
You didn't answer my question.
Who are you voting for?
Are you deaf or what?
I'm sorry, general?
I want to know who you're
voting for. You worm!
Answer me!
Long live Mexico!
Long live our revolution!
Long live our Xantos!
Long live our Xantos!
Who is the brave one that
started the rebellion?
Good job, son.
What's your name?
they call me Vasco, because
I always where this hat.
And since my parents
were Basque...
...my father used to clean public
toilets in Spain.
He came here with big ideas.
He wanted to introduce the
idea of pay toilets to Mexico.
But he enjo yed hookers so much
he spent his very last penny...
...and became a janitor
at the San Bernardino toilets.
You know San Bernardino
pretty well?
Pretty well? Of course,
I was born there.
Very good, Vasco.
Be the leader of my men.
they are brave people.
Lead them to the attack!
Conquer San Bernardino!
Destro y the Regulares!
Annihilate thexantistas!
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, to you!
I now appoint you my lieutenant
and commander with full powers!
To Vasco!
Long live Mexico!
Long live the revolution!
Long live Vasco!
Vasco didn't know it yet, but
for a dangerous new job...
...Mongo would always
appoint a new lieutenant.
The General would always arrive
when everything was over.
And that also happened
at San Bernardino...
...where the conquerors were busy
celebrating their victory...
...it was at that point, I arrived.
Don't move, compañero!
Why are you dressed like that?
What side are you on?
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing with
that wagon? What's in there?
Why are you asking so many
questions? Let's just kill him!
Your friend is right, compañero.
When you're about to die,
you don't ask so many questions.
Good job, Vasco!
It's all for the glory of Mexico!
- Good job Vasco!
- Who is she?
Why are you so pissed?
Do you like the way I shoot?
Do you like the way I shoot?
Are you one of them?
Then I'll need to search you.
Yes! Go ahead and search her!
Bravo, Vasco!
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
Come on, shoot that little pig!
He y, look! There's a
penguin in San Bernardino!
Let's see if the
penguin likes bananas.
Come, here. Come on, come on.
Come to daddy.
Take this nice banana.
Ex cuse me, would you please tell
me who threw this banana peel?
- I did, why?
- Oh, it was you?
This for is you. Take it.
- For me?
- Pretend you won a bet.
Please, can you tell me
which is the best hotel in town?
The best hotel in town?
Well, that's the only one.
It smells like piss,
but you'll get used to it.
Thanks. You're a real gentleman.
I'm very grateful to you.
No problem, no problem at all, sir.
God bless you. God bless you.
No problem, no problem at all.
Vasco, why do you think
he gave you that dollar?
Because the jerk was scared.
I'm looking for General Mongo.
Where I can find him, please?
General Mongo's busy
conducting a revolution.
Didn't you notice?
I did hear a few shots and
see a few dead bodies but...
...I thought it was
the typical local folklore.
I'd like to have your best room,
and a hot bath, please.
We only have one, and it's taken by
that gentleman, over there.
He must be important,
that gentleman, over there.
Yes, he's one of General Mongo's
officers, the strongest.
- What's his name?
- Who?
- Him. The strongest one.
- Pepito. Pepito Tigrero.
Pepito.
Pepito Tigrero. Here we are!
Now the room is free, prepare
a nice little bath for me.
And where's Pepito Tigrero
going to stay?
At the hospital.
Please forgive me.
Your mother is a prostitute,
your father's a crook and...
...your grandfather is a man
with avery broad buttocks.
What did you say?
I'll explain. Your mother's a whore,
your father's a damn thief...
...and your grandfather's
a notorious fag.
How dare you?
I generously spared your sister.
Now you know me. Tell General
Mongo the Swede is here.
Nice to see you again, miss.
Although, I'd rather entertain
beautiful girls in private.
Since the conversation is dying out,
I'm going to relax a little.
I hope this won't bother you.
Or maybe there's
something I can do for you?
You can join our side.
Why should I do that?
Because we are on the
side of the reason.
It is not always a good reason.
We, thexantistas, are fighting
for justice and freedom.
Ours is a just cause.
I heard that in every
country I sold guns in.
You must not sell
the weapons to Mongo.
- He's a bandit.
- That's why he pays well.
You're like all the other strangers,
despicable and merciless.
Let's not exaggerate. To me,
it's only a question of price.
If you make a better offer,
the arms are yours.
We're mainly students.
And we are fighting to defend the
poor people. We are not rich.
Students or bandits, to me it
doesn't make any difference.
Send your leader to me.
If he offers more than Mongo,
we might be close to an agreement.
Our leader is a prisoner
of the Gringos.
A prisoner? What do you mean?
While Madero, Villa, and Zapata
were fighting against Diaz...
...we, who are followers of
Professor Xantos...
...started our own revolution
in these territories.
But when Mongo and his bandits
arrived, our leader left...
...for the U.S.A., in seeking help for
our cause, the cause...
...of freedom and justice.
Okay, that's pretty clear.
And what happened after that?
America knew that if
the Professor returned...
...their interest in the Mexican
oil wells would be lost.
Pretending to protect him,
they locked him up at Fort Yuma.
He's been there for
six months now.
No way, nothing's
going to wake him up.
The penguin hits pretty hard, huh?
If he's that strong, I don't think he
gave you that dollar out of fear.
Vasco!
they killed two of our men,
down at the station.
they say the Gringo did it.
Let's go.
He y, something's going
on down at the square!
Come on, out through the window.
Quick! If they find you
here, we're in trouble!
Look over there!
Somebody's running away!
Long livexantos!
Working for free usually
brings me bad luck. Come on.
He shouted, "Long livexantos!",
before he fell.
they were coming out
of the penguin's room.
I'm getting nervous.
Get out of the bed or
it'll turn into your coffin.
If you're nervous because of your
interest in the girl, be my guest.
You know very well why I'm here.
You're plotting to
help thexantistas.
If in Mexico, what
I'm doing, is called plotting...
Stop wasting time, Vasco.
He's a Xantista. Let's kill him now!
Yes, let's kill him! Shut up!
You are accused of killing two
of our men, down at the station.
Are you denying that?
If you understood the Latin saying,
"Mors tuavita mea"...
...you would understand
why I did it.
But I guess you did not attend
any courses in Humanities.
So you better go
call General Mongo.
He's a good friend of mine and
I'm sure he's waiting for me.
What's waiting for you is
something else, you'll see.
- Take him away.
- Move!
- See you later.
- Move fast!
Yes, I'll see you later.
Don't worry.
Mexicans aren't good
enough for you?
But I've got a special treatment
for those of your kind.
Penguin, what was that thing about
"morsel two and vita mea"?
Tell me again. I forgot about it.
I'd like to explain to you that,
as a foreign citizen...
...I'm entitled to the protection
of my Country's ambassador.
- But I guess there's no point to it.
- You're right.
That's what I thought.
And the General? Did he arrive?
No, but the time has
arrived for you to die.
You're making a big mistake.
I told you, the General's my
friend. He's the one who called me.
When the General is away,
I'm the one in charge here.
You'll see what a nice trick
I've prepared for you.
Anyhow, listen to me...
...if you tell me why
you gave me this dollar...
...I'll make sure you die instantly.
I won't let you suffer.
You don't want to know.
You'll feel too bad.
You're going to feel
a lot worse, I promise you.
You start as soon
as I raise my hand!
My hands are busy.
Send someone to rub my nose.
People of Mexico!
You're about to witness the
squashing of the head...
...of this son of a penguin!
- For General Mongo, charge!
- Let's go!
Get rid of that old jalopy!
Get it out!
Get it out!
How dare you insult your
General's car! You piece of shit!
You are demoted,
you son of a bitch!
You're lucky I'm only removing
your rank and not your head!
Get out of my way and
don't come back!
- Out of my way, I said!
- Of course, General.
Of course, of course.
I'm leaving right now.
Where is the Swede?
I'm going to hang you all if you
don't bring him to me alive, now!
Mongo, my friend, you don't
know how much I missed you.
By San Bernardino, to me your
life is worth less than garbage.
Diaz's government is a cesspool.
And I don't give a damn about
thexantista's high ideals.
I expect something better
from the revolution.
I want a large sum of money.
And since the money is
locked in a Swedish safe...
...it takes a Swede to open it,
a son of a bitch like you.
I do share your noble
ideals, General.
But why do you need
a safe to get rich?
You have the whole city to loot.
Just sell that statue.
It's ancient and worth
a lot of dough.
You're crazy!
No Mexican would dare put
a hand on that holy relic.
No. You're going to help
me get a hold of the money.
I'll tell them we need it to buy
your arms, and we'll share it.
I'll give you a third of the loot
and I'll be gone with the rest of it.
You'll be the alibi to fool
them all. How does that sound?
Very ingenious.
What's going on? What are
they doing, those idiots?
You're acting like animals!
Stop firing! It won't help!
This damn safe contains all
the riches of our nation.
But my men were never
able to open it.
If you want to be paid
for your arms, you open it.
You do know how, don't you?
Well?
It's a Svenson, wheel model.
Reinforced, triple German steel.
It's got a special
combination lock.
It weighs more than two tons.
God himself couldn't open it.
The only way is to
know the combination.
There must be some
manager or clerk who knows it.
Or did you kill them all?
All ex cept for one,
Professor Xantos. He's in Yuma now.
But, how can we possibly
bring him back here?
It's not impossible.
I'll take care of it.
I'll go to Yuma. And I'll bring
Xantos back to San Bernardino.
Of course! How wonderful!
With that money, we're on
our way to a glorious victory!
Thank you, Swede. Thank you in
behalf of our beloved fatherland.
You're welcome. We'll split the
treasure my way. Half and half.
Three shares for me,
one for you.
Take it or leave it General.
Do you agree?
Rest assure that we trust you
unconditionally. Go then!
Go! Come back with our enemy!
- General Mongo. General Mongo!
- I n you we trust.
Sorry for intruding.
May I?
I may be just a piece of crap.
But what about you?
You're going to trust some one
who killed two of our men?
What if he's a spy?
He's right, Mongo!
What else can we do then?
As a foreigner, he's the only
one who can cross the border.
Any Mexican would be stopped.
Not a Mexican accompanied by
a citizen of a neutral country.
Why don't you come with me?
You can keep an e ye on me,
and help me too.
Right!
I won't be your servant!
I will not serve a stupid penguin!
I understand. You're scared.
He y, calm down.
Calm down both of you.
Come on, Vasco. The Swede
didn't mean to offend you.
Besides, you called him a
penguin. Now you're even.
If you really want to
fight with him...
...you guys can always do that
when you get back.
I'm offering you the opportunity
to earn back your former rank...
...and all the privileges that
go with that rank.
Go with him. Help him out.
Never take your e yes off him.
And bring us that bastard, Xantos!
I'm asking you to do it
for your General...
...for your compañeros...
...for our revolution.
- If you insist, okay.
- Long live the revolution!
Doesn't heat like this kill penguins?
Well, it certainly isn't comfortable.
Now you can tell me
why you gave me this dollar.
I don't think this is quite
the right moment.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Who are you?
Where are you going?
My name is Yodlaf Peterson.
I'm a Swedish citizen, going to
Hermosillo to get a train to the U.S.
Here's my passport.
Who's he?
He's my servant.
Go ahead, Sergeant.
This is an operational area.
We must photograph and register
everyone who's undocumented.
- We're at your disposal.
- Oh, no. It's just for him.
A good system of control.
Okay, Vasco. Let them
take your photograph.
- Take what?
- All right, dismount! Now!
Yes, you. Come on, dismount!
Have a little patience, Lieutenant.
He's just an ignorant peasant.
Come on, Vasco. It's easy.
Just stand in front of the platoon.
Sure. Sure, sure.
A bit more to your right.
Move to your left. A little more...
...still more, more. A little more.
There, that's it. Now, don't move.
Ready?
One. Two. Three.
You're an idiot!
A widow?
It must be sad for you to
always travel and sleep alone.
I'm not alone.
I'm traveling with these.
Your late husband's?
No, they're mine. Stay where
you are and keep your hands up.
- We won't hurt anybody.
- If they don't ask for it!
Nobody move!
Have we arrived?
No, it's a robbery.
We had no other
way of getting money.
But we don't want it for ourselves.
We're not bandits.
We are revolutionaries
And we're fighting for our
country's freedom.
Long live freedom!
For a revolutionary, and even
a bitch, but she's not bad looking
What should we do
with those two?
The Swedish one, there.
He helped us once.
But the other is one of
Mongo's lieutenants.
- We better shoot him!
- No! Let's hang him instead.
No. Professor Xantos
taught us not to use violence.
Killing this bandit without a trial
would just put us on his level.
Of course, she's right. The lady is
right, my friends. No violence!
Shut up!
Careful. Don't make me
regret being generous.
Stop him! Stop him!
He's stealing the train!
Penguin! Wait for me!
Penguin!
Let's go kill! Compañeros!
Let's go!
Let's go to Yuma!
To Yuma! Help me.
You son of a bitch!
He y John, listen to this.
An unknown Mexican escaped
after brutally murdering eight men.
With the help of Yodlaf
Petersen, a Swedish citizen.
There's a reward of 2000 pesos
for the capture of these two men.
they were last seen heading for
Texas aboard the train they stole.
What did you say the
Swede's name was?
The Swede, Yodlaf Peterson.
Why, do you know him?
Do we know him, Marshall?
We know him extremely well.
Marshall will signal the
arrival of the train.
Come out, John.
I saw Marshall flying
around over here.
And wherever you go, he goes.
Yodlaf! What a nice surprise.
- Good to see you again, John.
- The pleasure is all mine.
I never thought you'd get down
off that cross I nailed you to.
But I did, see?
John and I got into
serious trouble in Cuba.
We sold some defective
merchandise to the rebels.
To save my own life, I had
to blame everything on him.
John, how did you
get out of that mess?
I owe it all to Marshall.
He's the only one
that didn't abandon me.
He freed me from the nail that
was pinning my flesh to the tree.
How? Did he pull the
nail out with his beak?
No, he ate my hand off. Look.
Well, these things happen.
It was good seeing you again, John.
But I must go now.
You aren't going anywhere.
He's yours.
That's enough.
they want you dead or alive.
And since I have a choice,
naturally, I favor...
...the first solution.
You won't hold it against me,
will you?
No. I can take a joke.
You stay here and
keep him company...
...up until the final moment, Marshall.
Pretty hot, huh?
Vasco, shoot that damn animal!
You made him mad. You're a
penguin, you should understand...
...he gets pissed off if
you treat him like that.
Sooner or later...
...every son of a bitch
comes to a brutal end.
Get me down from here!
Calm down, calm down.
Die in peace. Don't worry.
I will always keep this
as a reminder of you.
Damn heat!
What about the revolution?
What happened to your ideals?
And to your mission with Mongo?
- You want some?
- No, thanks.
Xantos! We have to take him to
San Bernardino to open the safe.
The Revolution needs
that money, compañero.
You can't get the Professor
out of Fort Yuma by yourself.
Help me down, Vasco.
Help me down!
I can't take it anymore!
Okay, okay. But...
...first...
...you have to swear...
...by San Bernardino...
...that this is the last time
you'll try to fool me.
I swear, by any Saint you want.
Don't go anywhere.
Are you a Catholic?
Of course I'm a Catholic.
Quick! Hurry up!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
What the hell are you doing?
I havevertigo! I'm afraid!
I can't do it! Oh, God!
What do you mean,
you havevertigo?
Come on, hurry up!
The rope is choking me!
I fooled you, huh?
Vertigo? Me?
Watch this. The hell
with vertigo. Look at this.
Good job, compañero.
If you ever come to Sweden,
I'll introduce you to my sister.
Beautiful e yes, blue like the sky,
like only you have.
Penguin, you're not dead!
Are you? Don't joke!
What about the
revolution? Penguin!
Penguin, the blood is
going to my head.
Everything is black! Penguin, help!
The pawn moves, and checkmate.
You see, Mr. Rosenbloom?
I n chess, even the weakest piece
can win over the stronger pieces.
When one has principles,
every thing is possible.
- We appreciate your principles.
- And we're here to help you.
We're ready to invest a great
deal of money in your cause.
Human nature has often surprised
me with its sudden generosity.
But experience has taught me the
rich never lend to the poor...
...without expecting
something in return.
We want nothing more
than a guarantee...
...that we'll continue to have
what we've always had until now.
Recognition of our rights by any new
government coming into power.
What do you mean?
Sign the ninety-nine year contract
granting us the oil rights...
...and we'll help you return to Mexico
and win your revolution.
We have the means to do it.
The Mexican revolution needs
nobody's help to triumph.
Now get out of here!
Your tactics are disgusting.
You make me sick to my stomache.
Seventeen. Black.
How do you play that?
Bet on a number. If it lands on it,
you win thirty-six times your wager.
Really?
Try it.
That looks good.
- Thirteen, red.
- There, there.
- Can I play any number I want?
- Take your choice.
- Ninety-nine.
- You can't bet on ninety-nine!
You told me I can
play any number I want!
I want ninety-nine, if you don't
play it, I'll shoot you in the ass.
But ninety-nine doesn't exist.
Didn't you tell me any
number I want?
Please, tell him that
number doesn't exist.
I'll give you a different
number, compañero.
The lucky one will win.
There are two of us, right?
Then let's bet on number two.
But if we lose you tell me why
you gave me that dollar, okay?
Right.
- What the hell did you say?
- A few magic words to help us.
Thirty-three. Black.
Sorry for you guys.
And I'm sorry for you, buddy.
Yeah, this matter could lead
to mortal displeasure.
I made a mistake. How stupid of me!
The winning number is two.
This is your lucky day.
Let's see. One, two, three...
- Thirty-six. Thirty-six dollars.
- Of course.
Gentlemen, the tables
are closed now.
Besides, there's suddenly
something wrong with my nose!
I better go take care of it.
Good afternoon, good afternoon.
Next time we'll bet on ninety-nine
so we'll win more money.
Maybe.
That money belongs
to me, sweetie.
I n Dallas, you said you needed
it for you Aunt's funeral.
I n San Antonio you had to get your
horse out of hock. I n Wichita...
Wichita was the best night
ever. Unforgettable!
I'm getting nervous.
Compañero, let me introduce
you to Zaira, wonderful Zaira...
...amazing Zaira. The only blonde
I know who's blond all over.
You're the only Swede I've ever met.
Hopefully, you'll be the last.
If I were you, young man,
I'd be keeping better company.
This is your chance
for a new experience!
And your moment of glory,
you Latin stud.
Ex cuse me, isn't
she your woman?
Yes, but these sort of things
we Swedes don't care about.
Zaira, I'm going to a meeting.
Keep this young stud with you.
This is one chance you don't want
to let slip through your fingers.
Leave it to me.
You think you can resist me?
I can try.
Xantos is very famous.
The U.S. has to release him soon
to avoid an international scandal.
If he returns safely to Mexico,
and wins the revolution...
...we'll lose our oil concessions.
It's a risk we can't afford, John.
We can't let that happen.
You know the fee.
Ten thousand dollars...
...to be paid when
the job is done.
But we've brought you a little
pleasure as an advance.
avery welcome gift.
The job will be done.
John, the Swede is gone!
Someone must've released him.
Marshall, you're getting old!
- She's blonde everywhere!
- What happened?
It was too much of
a shock, I guess.
You better take him away. I have
to get to the Fort on time tonight.
The Commandant has
invited me to his birthday party.
Me and my girls. We are to get in
after dark and out before daylight.
To protect the reputation and
prestige of the U.S. Army.
I'll help you protect
the prestige of the U.S. Army.
He y, what's going on
in your mind, Swede?
Sergeant! He y, Sergeant!
Out of the way!
- Ah, you're here.
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Same bunch as usual?
- Yes, same as usual.
I've never seen her before.
That's right. Of course,
I forgot. She's a new one.
Let's not waste time. I'll let you try
her when you come see us.
All right, I'll count on it.
Open the gate!
Squad, attention! Left, face!
Get in step, forward, march!
Here they are.
Very well. Finally!
Welcome to the Fort, Miss Zaira.
More beautiful than ever.
And you, Captain,
are as gallant as ever.
What are you gaping at?
Back to your barracks. Go to bed!
Clear theyard, go on!
Happy Birthday!
Hurray! Congratulations! Cheers!
Jimmy, I understand you have a
very important guest at the Fort.
Who, Professor Xantos?
He's upstairs. He's an old bookworm,
and not interested in young women
Fire! Fire! Hurry, sound the alarm!
Alarm! Hurry up! Get the buckets!
Start forming a chain!
Bring the horses out!
Over there, move! Faster! Faster!
Get all of the horses
out of the stalls!
Faster, faster!
Ex cuse me, sir but we're on fire.
Yes, we sure are, dearie.
You don't understand,
the Fort's burning down!
- What?
- Fire! It's spreading like crazy!
Send for theyuma City
Fire Department, hurry!
Attention! Everybody listen!
The fort is on fire!
Evacuate the building. Get out, hurry!
Hurry! Get out, get out!
The alarm! The alarm!
The alarm! The alarm!
Fire! Fire! The fort is on fire!
Get the water wagons, now!
We've got one hell
of a blaze out there!
Penguin!
Go to the tank.
Zaira!
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.
- What about the Professor?
- I'll take care of him.
Get outside and
help the others. Hurry!
- Wait! Who are you?
- There's no time for explanations.
Your people are waiting
for you, they need you.
You must get out of here.
I will return to my country legally,
not like an escaped convict...
...but like a man who wins
his freedom without violence.
Sometimes you have to
use violence, Professor.
No! Give me just one case
where violence is necessary.
This one.
What happened? Where's
the water? Damn it!
I'll fill up the tank, Sergeant!
Okay, but hurry up! Move on!
Faster! Let's fight this fire!
Go, horse! Move, move!
Vasco, come here! Take him.
He weighs a ton.
Stuff him all the way in.
Keep stuffing. Keep stuffing.
Only women like you are
good for something. Thanks.
Come on, horse. Move it!
He y, wait!
Bye, blondie!
Things are going our way.
Now It'll be easier to get Xantos.
How do you feel, Professor?
I think he's mute. He hasn't said
a word since we left the Fort.
Professor, why are those idiots
so anxious to get killed for you?
What the hell do you tell them?
Tell us what you tell them,
and see how we react.
I bet the poor mute
man is also deaf.
No, he can hear and speak.
Just not quite the way you do.
