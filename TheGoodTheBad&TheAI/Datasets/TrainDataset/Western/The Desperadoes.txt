Red Valley! All aboard!
It's empty.
Let's go.
I know how you feel, boys.
Being cleaned out is no joke,
any way you look at it.
Still, there's a good side to this.
I've learned my lesson and so have you.
We sure have, Clanton.
We're through putting our money
in your bank.
Don't forget about them killings, neither.
It's blood money now.
I think you're making a mistake, friends,
as far as my bank is concerned.
Look what I had sent from Salt Lake City.
Say, she's built like a battleship, Clanton.
It'd take a battleship to blow her open,
Uncle Willie.
Just came a little too late though, didn't it?
No! Not at all!
I aim to pay back part of
what everybody lost out of my own pocket.
Are you fooling?
Why, I've got a funny way of fooling.
Mortgaging every thing I have
to raise the money.
I've never heard a banker talk
like that before.
Now, don't thank me!
Don't thank me, friends.
I won't be able to pay you back
more than fifty cents on the dollar.
But at least you don't lose everything...
and I can let you have some cash now
to tide you over.
I invite you to step inside
and do your banking.
That invitation's good enough for me.
Come on, boys. The line forms on the right.
That's the spirit, Uncle Willie.
What's good enough for you ought to be
good enough for everybody in Red Valley.
Pay off everybody 50%.
Need a little money, Mr. McLeod?
I thought I told you
there was to be no killing by Jack Lester.
They'll forget it.
Killing's never forgot,
and it leads to more killing.
- You made a bad mistake, Clanton.
- Why blame me for the killing?
You were supposed to bring in someone
from out of town to do the job.
Sam Glennon in Leadville
was to send me a man.
He was to be here days ago,
but he didn't turn up.
He'd have done a clean job,
from what Sam said.
Maybe so, but we couldn't wait forever.
That's why I called in Jack Lester.
Here's his share.
Finding out he blew an empty safe
must be getting him hot under the collar.
You're a fool, Clanton.
People can stand losing money
but they hunt down killers.
- I told him not to shoot.
- You didn't tell him loud enough.
- Willie, you heard me say...
- Shut up!
You're a great man
in this town now, Clanton.
I guess you're even greater
than Santa Claus.
These suckers will be getting back
half of what they put in...
and naming their children after you.
- How much did we clear?
- $80,000.
That's good.
That calls for a drink on the house.
Here's to your health, Mr. Clanton.
That's not a bad amount
to get out of a town this size.
It's nothing to what we can get later...
if that contract from the army
comes through for the horses.
Santa Claus don't drink.
Whoa.
Hey, Jack! You home? Willie McLeod.
Jack Lester!
- I'm here.
- Hello, Jack.
Morning, gents.
Nice to see you all looking so bright
and happy.
It's gonna be a lovely day.
Jack, I brought you a present.
$10,000, cash money,
and you don't have to thank me.
Looks like you ain't gonna.
You fellas look like you done something
you're ashamed of.
I ought to blow your head off.
- That don't seem like friendly talk.
- Not the least bit friendly.
I don't trust you and Clanton
any more than you trust me.
Why, Jack, where did you ever
get the feeling we didn't trust you?
The other night in the bank.
The minute I found out
I'd blew an empty safe.
- You're a little too smart, Uncle Willie.
- You ain't quite smart enough.
Three men murdered in cold blood.
What's the sense to it?
We was robbing a bank.
I'm a lot older than you, Jack.
In my time I've seen a lot of men
with itchy trigger fingers like you.
They're all in Boot Hill with dirt in their face.
Somebody cured them of that itch.
Would you like a couple of holes
in that big fat belly of yours?
You're holding up the U.S. Mail
and that's a federal offense.
- Hello, Uncle Willie.
- Hello, Sheriff.
You're behind time.
You ought to be in Basin City
with the mail by now.
I've been backtracking to find you.
One of my mules got a loose shoe
and I was held up.
- What you doing in this neck of the woods?
- Just looking around.
Anything special on your mind?
One of the bank robbers forgot something
the other night.
- He did?
- This.
Part of a spur, ain't it?
Hammered silver rowel.
Unusual for this part of the country.
Ever noticed anyone with a pair like them?
No, can't say that I have.
You get around a lot, and I was counting
on you to give me a lead.
When a man gets as old as I am,
his memory goes first.
Maybe some fellow in silver spurs
has passed me...
and neither hear nor see him.
If I do hear or see him,
I don't remember it afterwards.
A man can't do much when he gets old
except save his money.
Stay out of mischief.
Hey, Uncle Willie.
You forgot to give me back
that piece of spur.
Spur? What spur?
That silver-hammered rowel
I picked up in front of the bank.
- You didn't give me no spur.
- Sure I did. Take a look.
Maybe you put it in your pocket.
- Is this it?
- That's it.
That just goes to show you
how forgetful a man of my age can get.
If you hadn't remembered giving it to me...
you probably never would have
got that spur back.
- Don't forget the way home.
- I might any day now.
- So long, Steve.
- So long.
Reach, and don't turn around.
Reach.
I got a lame horse here. We're gonna trade.
- I wouldn't like that.
- That's too bad.
Now don't turn around.
- Anybody here?
- Yes.
- Take care of my horse, ma'am?
- You bet.
Don't usually see a girl running a stable.
Belongs to my father, Will McLeod.
- Did you say McLeod?
- Know him?
Sure. I've heard of him.
Everybody in this part of the country
knows him.
- You from around here?
- Nope.
My name's Allison McLeod.
Pleased to meet you.
I didn't quite catch your name.
I didn't give it.
- Nice horse you got here.
- Yeah.
- Bet you had to pay plenty for him.
- Too much.
Found plenty of dust, too, didn't you?
The north trails are full of it.
And there's red mud
between here and Basin City, too.
- You've seen a lot of country, haven't you?
- Not as much as you.
Red Valley's kind of new to me.
What's it like?
Sleepy and quiet.
Once in a while we raise a crop of horses.
That isn't all.
- Adios, brother.
- Have you known your horse long?
Time doesn't matter.
We fell in love at first sight.
- Isn't that a dangerous habit?
- Not when you get used to it.
I'll be coming back here tonight
to see my horse.
- You be here?
- I'll be waiting.
The Commercial House is a block down.
You'll find that more suitable.
This suits me.
- I'm afraid we have no vacancies.
- Look again.
- I'm very sorry, but...
- Is there anything wrong?
I believe this gentleman has ambitions
beyond his means, Countess.
I think we can afford
a little charity occasionally.
Follow me.
Thank you.
- Cheyenne!
- Take it easy, Countess. I'm only a visitor.
What are you doing here?
There's $10,000 on your head.
- Are you crazy?
- Nitro come in yet?
Yes, he's been here for days
waiting for you.
He said something about a bank job.
- Is it the kind of a job I think it is?
- Yes.
The Clanton Bank?
I think that's the name
Sam Glennon told me.
Hell, that job's already been done.
Now you'd better move
before somebody recognizes you.
Somebody already recognized me
on the way from Salt Lake City.
I had to travel the long way around.
That's why I'm late.
- I sent Nitro on ahead to wait for me here.
- I thought you were quitting.
So did I, but they won't let me.
I've tried a dozen times.
Every time I got started...
somebody remembers my face
and wants that $10,000.
Then I get hunted down like a coyote.
What else can I do but keep on?
Come on, sit down.
This will do.
You don't have to sit
facing the doors in here.
Sort of a habit with me.
- You're kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- Maybe.
How long has it been
since you've seen my folks?
About six months.
Your sister's a very pretty girl.
You'd be proud of her.
- How's my kid brother?
- Good boy. Straight as a string.
You're not heading out that way, are you?
It's Nitro.
Oh, my boudoir!
Cheyenne, welcome to Red Valley.
How do you like the little blowout
I gave you?
You big zombie, you...
I told you to leave that nitroglycerin alone.
I was leaving it alone.
But you see, if it gets a little too warm
or a little too cold...
- My knee.
- What's the matter? You hurt?
Yeah, that marble top fell on it.
- Help me.
- Help him? I'll break his other leg.
Don't pick on me. I ain't done nothing.
- Countess. What...
- There's nothing to get excited about.
Just a lamp exploded.
Tim, get inside.
The rest of you, go back to work.
Go on, hurry up. Shut the doors.
Take it easy. Tim, look at his leg, will you?
The bottle that went off was just that big.
Any bigger, and you'd be picking me up
with a spoon.
I wish we were!
Funny how a little noise upsets a woman.
They won't believe
that exploded lamp story.
The help here get enough pay
to believe anything.
I'll send Nitro after you
as soon as he can ride.
I hope it's before he blows me all over Utah.
I'm staying.
Cheyenne, this town is right on the railroad.
Somebody's bound to come through
and spot you.
- We won't be here for long.
- But why sit around and wait for him?
I was sitting in a jail in Colorado
and Nitro waited for me.
When he was through waiting,
I bet there was no jail left.
Just a hole in the ground.
Please go. I'll take good care of him.
Don't you see? I can't leave a man
who'd put his neck in a noose to save me.
Sure. I see.
You just want to commit suicide.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hello, Allison.
- You look like you could use another horse.
- I sure could.
- But how did you know?
- You tell me how you lost your horse first.
- Somebody held a gun on me and we traded.
- Know him?
I didn't see him.
He made me keep my back turned.
A horse was brought in today
with red mud on him.
The kind you run into
on the way to Basin City.
So I came out here expecting
to find somebody dead or walking.
You mean somebody brought my horse
in the stable?
Who?
I don't remember his name.
Sure you can't remember anything
about him, Allison?
Yes, Steve. The way I remember him,
he wouldn't come out last in a gun fight.
He seems awfully quick, Steve.
Have you ever seen how fast I can duck?
Don't tell me you're going to break down
and worry about me.
Don't you think it's about time?
Evening, Miss McLeod.
Hello. Your horse is back there.
Thanks.
Hello, brother.
Reach.
Reach, and don't turn around.
You're under arrest.
I got him, Steve.
You certainly did.
First time a woman
ever finished a fight for me.
Get some water, Allison.
This is a friend of mine.
- A friend?
- Yeah, hurry up.
Quick.
Douse him.
- Hello.
- How do you feel?
I'm all right.
- Surprised to see you.
- Same here.
- That a star on your vest?
- Yeah. I'm Sheriff of Red Valley.
Can I do anything?
- What'd you hit me with?
- A bucket.
- You sorry?
- How was I to know you were friends?
Here, let me wipe your face.
You got a funny way of greeting strangers
in this town...
- but you're awful nice to them afterwards.
- You don't seem to be a stranger.
We used to be partners back in Wyoming.
That was my horse you borrowed.
- Your horse?
- Yeah, didn't you know?
No, I was in a hurry...
and I left some money in the saddlebag.
Didn't you find it?
No. We'll settle the deal tomorrow.
Come on.
I think you need a drink.
If you'll bring Mr. Smith,
I'll make some coffee.
That is what you said your name was,
didn't you?
Yes, Smith. Bill Smith.
Come on, Bill Smith.
Sure is a funny way to treat a horse thief.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Al. Hi, Steve.
Horse kick this fella?
Yeah, on the head.
There ain't a worse place to get kicked.
Man sometimes is silly the rest of his life.
Mr. Smith's all right.
- This is my Dad.
- I'm glad to meet you.
Bill Smith's an old friend of mine.
That so?
I ain't seen you around here before, son.
I'm from Leadville.
I know a fella there name of Sam Glennon.
Know him?
Yeah. Come to think of it,
he told me to look you up when I arrived.
Small world, ain't it?
We're going to make Mr. Smith
some coffee, Dad.
- I'll fix your supper while I'm at it.
- I'll unhitch my mules and be right in.
Sure is a small world.
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.
Yeah, they've got a right to.
They'll have to pay for it later.
I'm crazy about you, Jack.
Are you crazy about me?
I'd be crazy if I was.
You're lying.
Jack, would you die for me?
You would if you loved me enough.
I'm the kind of a woman
who drives men to...
...kind of a woman who wants
to drive men to drink.
- A dangerous woman. I want men to die for...
- Shut up.
- Who'd you smile at?
- A horse thief.
- He here?
- Over against the wall.
Seems to be a wallflower tonight.
Some people like to be wallflowers.
It gives them a chance
to keep their backs against the wall.
What's he like, Steve?
A little faster with a gun
than anybody I ever knew.
- Evening, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening.
They dance well.
She does.
That is, they do.
- I'm surprised to find you still in Red Valley.
- That so?
Ain't much a fellow like you
can do here now.
Appears to me
as if you'd be getting kind of restless.
I'm satisfied.
If you should need a little traveling money,
I could help you out.
I don't.
You got here too late, Smith.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Bill, I got a girl here
who wants to dance with you.
My feelings won't be hurt if you refuse.
I won't refuse.
- Thanks, Steve.
- You're not welcome.
It was nice of Steve to lend me his girl.
I'm not his girl to lend.
It was nice of Steve anyway.
- It's a surprise to see you here tonight.
- Why?
For a lot of reasons.
- Only one reason why I came here tonight.
- What's that?
You.
I don't think I'm going to ask you
any more questions.
Something the matter, Countess?
- No, nothing.
- I thought maybe I stepped on your foot.
But you will, probably.
Steve, would you and Uncle Willie
mind stepping outside for a minute?
Sure, Hank.
We have some responsible citizens
gathered there...
- and we'd like to have you join us.
- What's going on?
You'll find out when you get there.
Come on, Uncle Willie.
Here he comes now, Judge.
Well, boys, what'll it be?
As the legal law in Red Valley,
I represent a body of citizens...
that want to do something
about those men killed in the bank robbery.
You don't seem much concerned.
Well, we are.
That's right, Steve.
Can't blame them for wanting action.
You can't get action
till you know who did it.
When will we know? It looks to me...
like you spend most of your time
loafing around the country or dancing.
That's no way to catch murderers
and bank robbers.
I have to work my own way.
And while you're doing so,
what's to prevent it from happening again?
We got a lot of money coming into this town
from that horse contract.
If you don't get them robbers,
they're apt to be back.
These horses we are selling to the army
are about all we have left.
- They won't come a second time.
- That's what you say.
My word's either good or it's not.
To me that don't mean a thing.
I want to see a hanging.
Why, a law officer ought to be out
on the trail, not in a dance hall...
hopping around
like a frightened mountain goat.
Any time enough people want me to resign,
I'll do it.
- That's all I've got to say.
- That's good enough for me.
- For me, too.
- Have a drink.
There's plenty of girls in there.
Have a drink, boys.
Get inside and enjoy yourselves.
- You worried about Steve?
- Yeah. A little.
I think being sheriff means a lot to him.
It means being able to stay here.
Any man would want to do that.
- In kind of a bad spot, ain't you?
- They can't expect miracles.
When I arrest him,
I want to know I've got the right man.
I wish I could help you.
Have you uncovered anything at all?
- I got an idea the man I want is Jack Lester.
- Jack Lester?
- Why, he's only a common rancher.
- Uncommon, Uncle Willie.
He's got a ranch
and he doesn't run any livestock on it...
and he's got three hired hands
to help him do nothing.
- You must be mistaken, Steve.
- I'm getting surer every day.
Do you remember the silver rowel
I showed you?
He used to wear a set of silver spurs
and he doesn't wear them anymore.
And I always thought Jack didn't have
a dishonest bone in his head.
This is the most terrible thing
I ever heard of, Steve.
Keep this quiet, Uncle Willie.
- Did you hear what he said?
- No.
I got a surprise for you
and it won't be pleasant.
I'm waiting.
He's sure Jack Lester is the man he wants.
As soon as he gathers up a couple
of loose ends, he's going to have him jailed.
That wouldn't be very pleasant
for either one of us.
- Dad.
- Where you bound, Al?
Home, to get something to eat.
If you're hungry, come along.
I'll be along in a little while.
I've got another surprise for you.
See that fellow over there
with Allison and Steve?
That's the Countess' cousin, Bill Smith.
What about it?
He's also the man Sam Glennon
was sending me from Leadville.
That's enough surprises for one night.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Home.
I've got to chaperon my daughter.
- What's ailing the old buzzard now?
- Plenty.
- Lester, I got a couple of surprises for you.
- Yeah?
Pleasant surprises.
- Well, had enough of my cooking?
- Plenty.
That's a fine thing to say.
- You know what I mean.
- I'll take all I can get. Some other time.
That's better.
Nice place, Red Valley.
What brought you here?
I thought I'd like to see the Countess.
What's keeping you, besides Allison?
Nitro's up at the Countess' with a bad foot.
You and Nitro Rankin?
- That's a funny combination.
- Nitro did me a favor once.
Do you know anything
about the bank robbery we had here?
I know one thing, Steve,
I had nothing to do with that robbery.
Do you believe me, Steve?
What you say
has always been good enough for me.
Thanks.
Why don't you stay here in Red Valley?
I'm wanted, Steve.
You can get $10,000 for me.
I don't want you at any price.
- Like some more coffee?
- Not for me, Allison. I gotta be going.
So do I.
- You're welcome here any time, Bill.
- Thanks.
- What about me?
- You're part of the family.
That's the trouble. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Miss Allison.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Uncle Willie.
- Through with your courting, boys?
- For tonight, yeah.
Yeah, having a daughter's a real trial.
Man with a son
can get all the sleep he needs.
But with a daughter you can't close
your eyes until everybody's gone home.
Thanks.
How do you like him, Al?
The way you do a book when
you don't know how the story turns out.
Books have happy endings.
This story could have a happy ending.
Does it matter what he's been?
All right, come on!
- Come on.
- Get it on.
Come on, boy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Kind of.
I got a job here breaking wild horses.
Horses the ranchers are selling to the Army.
A job? Are you crazy?
I must be, with a job like this.
Come on home with me. You want a job,
I'll give you one dealing faro at the hotel.
I like it here.
I get $3 for every horse I break.
I'll give you $50 for every sucker you break.
You'll get killed here, one way or another.
- No, thanks.
- Why?
I'm kind of changing my ways.
Aren't you kind of forgetting who you are?
I'm trying my best to, Countess.
All right,
I'll be by later and pick up the body.
Easy, boy.
You'll get used to a load on your back.
Everybody does.
He won't mind that in a little while.
Howdy. That's just
what I've been telling him.
Sometimes I feel sorry for them, though.
It's hard to lose that kind of freedom.
That depends on what you trade it for.
Are you working here now?
- It doesn't seem like your kind of job.
- Well, it isn't.
Then why are you doing it?
I answered that question the other evening,
or do you want me to tell you again?
I said I wasn't going to ask you
any more questions, didn't I?
Okay. Come on.
Listen to me.
Smith came to town to rob the bank,
didn't he?
Suppose you said so
in a crowded place where everybody...
Where everybody could hear you?
He's a stranger.
He's got no good reason for being in town.
He might find that hard to explain.
And Red Valley would sooner believe you
than him.
Especially since you have me
backing you up.
- That's a good idea, Clanton.
- Yes, but there's one flaw.
Smith might give some good answers.
He'll never get the chance to answer.
Easy.
Maybe I ought to just pour this liniment
on you and let it soak in.
You only been working one day and you're
as banged up as a Republican in Texas.
- What will you be in a month?
- I ain't banged up.
Now, take me, I'm fine.
Leg don't hardly hurt at all no more.
Hey, not so hard.
All right, that's enough.
You ought to knock
before you come in here, Countess.
Suppose I was taking a bath or something?
If I ever hear of you taking a bath,
I'll start knocking.
- How do you feel, Cheyenne?
- Pretty good.
- Going out again tonight?
- Just down to see my horse.
Does your horse like you to wear a tie?
He hasn't said.
A fella can't be too good to dumb animals.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I'm through carrying it.
It's getting too heavy for me.
You know, I heard a song one night
about the other side of the mountain.
That's where I've been for a long time,
on the other side.
And I want to come back.
- But can you?
- I can try.
They say a man is through
when he develops one weakness, Cheyenne.
You're getting weak.
You'll put your neck in a rope.
I can't help it.
Please get away from here
as soon as you can.
Red Valley's no place for you
to start over again. Get across the border.
I'm Bill Smith now,
I'm not Cheyenne anymore, and I like it here.
You're not Bill Smith,
you're Cheyenne Rogers, you always will be.
You're in too deep to ever get out.
I've been on the other side
of that mountain for a long time.
But I know I never can come back.
Maybe that's the difference between us.
No use getting serious, Countess.
Falling in love with him
is just building up for a quick goodbye.
He's gotta keep on traveling.
Nitro, did you ever want
to live your life over again?
Me? I couldn't stand the excitement
twice in a row.
Cheyenne and I were raised together
in Wyoming.
We went to the same school,
the same church.
We were like brother and sister.
I was gonna be a school teacher.
He was going to raise the best horses
in Wyoming.
You know, I always figured he didn't get
any pleasure out of gun fighting.
Then came the gold strike.
Claim-jumpers moved in on my father's land,
killed him.
I called on Cheyenne for help.
He came, there was a fight.
Some of the men were killed.
From then on, Cheyenne's been
a hunted man, and I'm responsible.
Don't you feel bad.
A fellow with his talent for throwing a gun
shouldn't waste it.
I ought to hit you,
but I'm afraid you'll explode.
- Bill, heading for the barn?
- Hello.
Allison ain't there right now.
I was just going down to look at my horse.
Steve was in to see his horse
little while ago.
Seems like there ain't nothing
more Ionesome than a Ionesome horse.
Except maybe a Ionesome man.
A man don't need to be if the saloon's open.
I just gave up chewing tobacco for rum.
Have a drink with me.
- No, thanks.
- Come on, one little drink won't hurt you.
All right.
Drink hearty, gents. Tonight's my last night.
- Selling out?
- Lock, stock, barrel and goodwill.
I've been building here for 10 years
and keeping dry while I did.
Tomorrow I take my first drink
and start back for Connecticut.
Red Valley's gonna miss you, Dan.
I ain't gonna miss Red Valley.
No, sir, a man's got a big responsibility,
running a place like this.
Keeping friendship and goodwill,
protecting his glassware.
I'm tired of it.
- Good luck to you, Dan.
- Thanks.
Here's to green pastures and no fences.
Hello, Jack. What'll you have?
Nothing but some answers
to a few questions, and from you, stranger.
- I don't answer questions.
- Now, Jack...
Shut up.
You're gonna answer mine.
Now, gents, this is a place for drinking,
not talking.
Name your poison
or I'll have to ask you to leave.
First I wanna know your name.
And speak up real loud
so everybody can hear you.
- Bill Smith.
- Louder.
- Bill Smith.
- Smith, huh?
Now, there's an unusual name.
Where are you from?
All over.
- What do you do for a living?
- Break horses.
You've been doing that one day. What else?
- None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.
You know what I think it is?
It's robbing banks.
I'm not carrying a gun.
Gents, please be friends.
It's a glass house here we're all living in.
Free drinks on the house.
Nothing like friendship and goodwill.
No gun?
That's mighty careless for an outlaw.
I say you robbed the Clanton Bank.
You're just waiting till we get more money
so you can rob it again.
Gents, please! Cut it out!
Gentlemen, please!
Whose bet?
- I'm at $10.
- I raise.
- Aces up.
- No good. Three 10s.
- All right, boys. He didn't fill his flush.
- Two pair.
Gentlemen, I'll have to ask you to leave.
- Raise $20.
- I call.
- What you got?
- Three queens.
The next time I meet you, Smith,
I'm gonna make sure that I...
Let's get along.
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.
Shame you missed the fight, Steve.
Guess we didn't do the saloon much good.
Look, I thought you wanted to talk to me.
Not talk, Cheyenne, just say goodbye.
- Is that an order, Sheriff?
- Depends on how you take it.
I didn't even have a gun with me tonight.
Next time you meet Lester,
you'll have to kill him.
That's what I was thinking.
Then his three friends, then Red Valley
will have a famous gunfighter.
I thought you could stop here, Cheyenne...
but you can't any more than you could stop
in Wyoming or Colorado.
Maybe you never can stop.
Anyway, I can't let you kill Lester.
I'm saving him.
So if you stay here in Red Valley...
there'll have to be a showdown
between you and me.
- I figure we might as well have it now.
- Suit yourself, Steve.
I can't help myself.
I can't even help Allison
unless I get you out of here...
before she breaks her heart wishing
for something that's not in the cards.
It's tough to leave here now.
I know.
But you couldn't have a better reason
than her.
Or a better reason for staying.
If you're not gone by morning, Cheyenne,
I'll be coming for you.
Nitro's getting the horses.
See for yourselves, friends.
Good American money,
and better than coin in every way.
My, what'll they think of next?
Those bills are light, handy,
don't take up much space.
You can carry a large amount
without attracting attention.
- Is that so?
- You'll see the day come...
when a man wouldn't start out anywhere
without a supply of paper money.
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.
The only thing you can't do with it
is fill your teeth.
- I guess you're kinda glad to get rid of us?
- I sure am.
That's the way I like to go.
Nobody misses me.
Keep on going this time, will you?
We won't be
running into each other anymore.
Let's not talk about it.
- Hey, what's the hurry?
- Hurry? Did it look like I was hurrying?
- So long.
- Come on, Cheyenne.
Don't worry about me, Countess.
I'll be all right.
You'll never be all right,
you old half-baked dynamite cooker.
Come on, let's go.
Why, what's the hurry?
We're not in any hurry.
- Yes, we are. I just robbed the bank.
- What?
Ride! Come on.
That does it.
Ben, Charley, Marty, Joe, Jim, follow me.
The rest of you cover this end
and get them in case they head back.
It's all over. Come on out
with your hands up and take your medicine.
- Let's shoot our way out of here.
- But we ain't got a chance.
- They're ten-to-one against us.
- Once in jail is enough for me. Come on.
You're too young to die, and so am I.
...4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Well, gents, there's 12 of you here
and it takes 12 to make a jury.
Now we got two men here to hang,
but we're going to do it by the law.
- Hank, you be foreman.
- All right, Judge.
Lift your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to put the law
on them bank robbers, so help you?
- I do.
- That's the stuff, Hank. Lower your hand.
We got to have a little evidence,
but very little.
Wait a minute.
- Holding up a bank's not a hanging offense.
- It ain't?
- It is if somebody's killed.
- They didn't fire a shot.
They fired plenty the other night.
Order in the court!
Jack, you mean to say that them fellows
did all the bank robberies?
I saw them kill three men
the night of the first robbery.
That's a lie.
Steady now, don't you go shooting
any witnesses, Sheriff.
We're gonna have law, all law
and nothing but the law in this court.
- Sit down, both of you.
- Listen to me, Judge.
Lester is swearing away the lives
of a couple of men...
because he got licked in a saloon fight.
I know Bill Smith here.
I've lived, eaten and fought with him.
We've dodged bullets together.
Some of them came from the law,
the kind of law you got around here.
Sit down! That ain't the kind of testimony
for a peace officer to be giving.
Your Honor, you got an eye in your head...
to see what a fine upstanding young man
Mr. Smith is.
Willie, no one asking you questions.
Besides you don't know about him anyway.
Sit down, Willie!
I aim to give Red Valley
a couple of hangings...
that they'll be proud of in days to come.
Any man that comes
between me and my doing it...
will get knocked higher than Gilroy's kite
with no due process of law at all.
Now let me hear the skunk that's changed
his mind after we been to all this trouble.
Let me hear him.
Only about 12 hours now
till you boys get some exercise.
Walking on air.
It ought to do you a lot of good
after all this sitting around.
Fellow runs into a mighty poor grade
of stock in a place like this.
Oh, hello, Smith.
Take a good look, my friend.
Pretty nice, ain't it?
It looks mighty trim.
You couldn't get a better stepping-off place.
Wait, I want to show you something.
Mighty slick, ain't it?
You're going out in style, Smith.
Makes me kinda glad I come here.
- Afternoon, Nitro.
- Hi, Judge.
Now, according to due process of law...
you condemned men
can make any last request you want.
Now, if you got one, speak up.
I got one, Judge. Keep your trap shut.
Keep your trap shut. That's a hot one.
How's he taking it?
Way a man like he is would.
Sits there and talks to Nitro.
Smokes too much
and waits for somebody to make a mistake.
- The way you would if you were in his place.
- There's nothing else to do.
He didn't kill those men, did he?
He didn't even rob the bank.
Nitro did that on his own.
I'm glad.
What can I do?
They want a hanging in Red Valley
and a man has sworn their lives away.
I'm Sheriff,
but I can't make my own law for friends.
Bill's what Dad calls from the other side
of the mountain, and he can't come back.
He tried, Steve.
He's hanging for something he didn't do.
I suppose a man has to die the way he lives.
Do you really believe that, Allison?
I'm trying to.
Here's lunch for the prisoners.
Let them out.
- Steve...
- I'll be responsible.
- Hi, Bill.
- Hello, Steve.
Same old stew.
I reckon a little pepper will liven it up some.
I won't be needing my hat anymore, Steve.
I'd kinda like for you to have it.
Thanks, but I can't take it, Bill.
Why not? It's a good hat.
I paid $40 for it in Santa Fe.
- Well, for old times' sake.
- Sure.
Why don't you put it on?
Let's see how you look in it.
How's this, Bill?
Why, the brim tips a little bit
to the left, kinda.
You're coming along with us, Steve,
just in case.
But you make one false move
and I'm gonna blast you.
I believe you would, at that, Cheyenne.
Back way.
Perfect.
Hi, Steve. Afternoon, boys.
Hi, Judge.
What is the meaning of this?
It means you can't keep your trap shut.
- This will be far enough for you, Steve.
- All right. Whoa, fellow.
Sorry it was your jail we had to break out of.
I didn't fall for that hat trick, Cheyenne.
We used it once in Deadwood. Remember?
Yeah, but do you think they'll fall
for that story back at Red Valley?
Why not?
I was careless, and I was surprised.
- There's been jailbreaks before.
- Sure there has, Sheriff.
- You ain't a bad fella as sheriffs go.
- Thanks.
This trail leads south.
Follow it to the end and when you get there,
keep going.
Good luck.
Adios, Steve.
You know,
there's something funny about this.
About what?
You may think I'm loco, but I got
a sneaking hunch the sheriff let us go.
Maybe you're right.
What are you stalling here for?
We was heading south.
- I'm going back into town tonight.
- Back into town? What for?
I'm going to see Sundown.
You pick up the grub and meet me here
when you got it.
- Let me know when you're here.
- We'll holler for you.
Sundown.
Looks like you're a shade slower
on the draw than you used to be, Cheyenne.
Cheyenne?
- Ain't I gonna get a chance?
- You had a chance.
- You can't shoot a man down like a dog.
- This is the other way around.
You sat here and let me walk into a trap.
They surprised me as much as they did you.
Ain't you stringing this out too long?
Why don't you kill him
and let's be on our way?
Cheyenne, you ain't serious, are you?
You're only joking.
Killing me don't make sense.
It never does,
to the fellow that's getting killed.
Let me talk.
Give me a minute
before you pull that trigger!
This is murder!
You tried to murder us.
A rope's a slow way to go.
I'll make it quick for you.
I've heard about you, Cheyenne.
You don't shoot people in cold blood.
That ain't what you said at the trial.
I'm sorry about what I said at the trial.
I didn't mean it.
- You're wasting your breath, Lester.
- No, Cheyenne, please wait!
I'll cut you in on the whole setup.
Keep talking.
Clanton's in on this.
I never thought of making a partner
out of a banker.
All you got to do is say the word
and you're in.
I knew you'd talk, Lester,
standing at the other end of a gun.
Now you're going down the street with me
and make another speech.
Hey, Jack! Are you ready?
They're inside! Let them have it!
Allison.
Bill.
It's you! Was it you?
What are you doing here?
I came back here to make Lester
admit he lied about those killings...
in front of you.
You didn't have to do that.
I couldn't go away having you think
I was a killer.
I never thought that.
Say that again.
I never thought that. I couldn't think it.
That's what I wanted.
I'd almost given up caring
whether anybody believed in me or not...
- until I met you.
- I believe in you.
I'll always believe in you, Bill.
I can't help myself.
Please go, Bill.
I want you to take a message
to Steve for me. It's important.
Tell him that Jack Lester...
A fellow with a daughter can't leave home
for a minute, can he?
You'd better get going, quick.
You think so?
You ain't got any friends but us
left in Red Valley.
They put Steve in jail for letting you escape.
Jail?
It's true.
Give Dad the message you had for Steve.
I haven't got any message for Steve now.
But I do have one for that banker Clanton.
You tell him to get Steve out of jail
by tomorrow, or I'm coming back.
Come on, Cheyenne, let's go.
Go, Bill.
We've got to get Steve out of jail.
If we don't, Bill will come back.
I can't help Steve, Allison.
I just can't.
I'm out. Four blue chips.
I'm out, boys.
- This is a funny place for you to be.
- I know it.
The respectable women in Red Valley
only come here when they want a favor.
Like finding out how much their husbands
are losing at gambling.
- Was he here?
- Who?
Bill, before he got in that mess with Lester.
You can call him by his right name,
it doesn't matter now.
Cheyenne Rogers...
and you can get $10,000 for him,
dead or alive.
I want him alive and far away from here.
Why did you keep him hanging on?
- I didn't.
- You're the reason he stayed.
You were the reason he tried to change.
And you'll be the reason
he'll finally put his head in a rope.
He mustn't come back again.
If he's found out Steve's in jail,
nothing can stop him.
One thing could. If Steve got out.
Not a chance.
Clanton's a big man in this town...
and you have a lot of influence with him.
If he said to release Steve, they'd let him go.
It's too late.
They want Cheyenne so much,
they'll hold Steve just to get him back here.
You can try, can't you?
You're a pretty cool customer.
You'll save him now, if you can...
but you wouldn't save him
when you should have.
You could have sent him on his way
with a few words.
I couldn't say those few words
and tell the truth.
Let him come and be strung up,
if he's foolish enough...
I don't care what happens to me,
you, Steve or anybody else...
but I want him alive! Do you understand?
Sure, I understand.
You'll have your heart busted up
in so many pieces...
you'll have to carry it around in a sack.
Goodnight, Miss.
Good afternoon, my friend.
What can I do for you?
Nothing. What are you doing
for yourself, Clanton?
Everybody who can carry a six-shooter
will be out tonight.
He'll have plenty against him if he comes.
Instead of waiting for him,
we should be celebrating the arrival...
of the last of them Army horses tonight
to fill our bank with money.
You, Jack Lester, had to talk.
What would you do,
if your head was gonna be blowed off?
I'd keep my mouth shut.
Then keep it shut. You're in the same fix.
Stop arguing, will you?
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.
- Maybe he won't come.
- Shut up.
Countess, this is an unexpected pleasure.
Stanley, I hate to bother you
but I just had to see you.
- Any time, dear lady.
- Hello, Uncle Willie.
- Afternoon, Countess.
- Take the seat of honor, my dear.
Now, what can I do for you?
Maybe she wants
to find out her cousin's real name.
You know, it's too bad he didn't kill you
when he had a chance.
He'll get another one.
Mr. Lester, I'll thank you
to keep a civil tongue in your head.
Your wish is my command.
Stanley, I want you to release Steve for me.
- Steve?
- Yes.
What on earth for?
Cheyenne won't come here if he's free.
I'll never ask you to do another favor for me.
Countess, I can't do that.
Please, Stanley, for me.
Anything, but not that.
A man in my position
can't ally himself with criminals.
- Will you forgive me?
- Certainly.
Certainly, I'll forgive you...
you big, loud-mouthed, stupid old windbag!
Maybe we ought to do
what the Countess says.
Sure, let Steve out to find Cheyenne.
Then he'd get a posse together
in Basin City and come back for us.
I've got a bump on my head.
Make up your mind where you stand.
I'm in the middle.
You better be out on the street tonight,
on our side.
All right.
- Got a gun?
- Yeah.
I thought I had.
That's funny. I took it this morning.
I didn't think you'd misplace a thing
that big.
Here it is.
- Keep it ready.
- I'll be ready.
There go the horses for the Army into town.
Yup. The town will be full of money.
Until Clanton and Lester
blow that safe again.
We're going back into town. Come on.
Hey, you're crazy. We're traveling south.
Steve's got to get out of that jail.
Forget it. He's safe there.
- Why break our necks?
- He broke his neck for us.
Well, looks like we're going back.
- We sure are.
- Sure.
We just walk in, and they're waiting for us
with shotguns and ropes.
You see those horses down there?
That's the answer.
We're going to go in with them.
Yeah, but how?
We'll join the herd at dusk.
We'll pretend to help the wranglers
and go in with the horses.
Nobody will see us. No trouble at all.
No, no trouble at all.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Nothing much.
- How was the trip with the mail?
- No different than usual.
- Hungry?
- No.
The whole country's talking
about this fellow, Smith.
- Has anyone seen him?
- I guess not.
His real name's Cheyenne Rogers.
Do you hear that?
Real bang-up outlaw, they say.
Dangerous afoot, on a horse,
or laying on his back.
Wouldn't think so quiet-spoken a fellow
as him is bad, would you?
- They say he's a good bad man.
- There ain't no such thing.
A bad man's bad for himself
and everybody else.
Hope I never lose you, Al.
I might get some real bad habits.
What do you say we leave town for a while?
Let's catch a train this afternoon
to San Francisco.
We'll stay there until we can't stand
the sight of fog or salt water.
But what about the stable?
And you have the mail...
They don't matter,
we'll have ourselves a time.
Restaurants, theatres and parties for you.
Lots of nice clothes and jewels
in San Francisco...
and I'll buy myself a plug hat
and a Prince Albert coat...
so you won't be ashamed of me.
How does that sound?
- I can't go.
- Why?
Don't ask me why. I just can't go.
I don't have to ask.
I guess you dropped this out of your stuff
when you was carrying it out.
Maybe you'd better put it back.
Are you mad at me?
No more than when you caught the measles
and I got them trying to nurse you.
Nobody ever asked for the measles,
they just come.
Suppose he don't show up?
I hope he doesn't,
but if he does I'll be with him.
- I got a couple more deliveries to make.
- Dad...
How do you feel?
Like my father felt before me.
Ain't much difference
between fathers, honey.
Cheyenne, quit your fooling.
The whole town's gunning for us.
We can't make it.
You got any nitroglycerin with you?
- Be Ionesome without it.
- All right, now listen.
We're joining the herd here.
I'll get in front, you get behind.
When I give you the signal,
set off a charge that will stampede them.
- Yeah, then what?
- I'll be leading them, they'll follow me.
If your horse falls in the front
of them wild critters...
it'll be your last ride.
I'll run them into town
and I'll lose myself in the herd.
You're still crazy.
They'll be waiting in the street,
but not for long.
The stampede will soon clear it.
Yeah? What happens next?
I get to the jail and Steve gets out.
Then what?
I don't want to tell you the end.
You might lose interest.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Smith.
I thought you were breaking horses
at the corral.
I decided to take a little vacation.
You need some help bringing them in?
Sure thing. The last couple of miles
are always the hardest.
It'll go fast for you.
Do you think they'll come?
If they do, they'll think they've run
right into the middle of Custer's last stand.
What are you carrying the hardware for?
They'd have crossed the border by now.
You better stay inside.
There's liable
to be some lead flying tonight.
Go on, all right. Don't worry.
- Who's there?
- It's Amos. Open the door.
Leave the door unlocked.
If he comes in, we'll make it easy for him
to get a belly full of lead.
Blackie, you watch the back door.
Stampede!
Bill!
Here's a gun, Steve.
I'm coming in the back way.
Get to that back door.
Drop that shotgun, Blackie.
Don't believe me?
Let's get out of here.
Open that door, I'll blast you.
Come in, Cheyenne.
All right, open it.
Where do we go from here?
After Clanton. You want him and Lester.
Clanton? You sure?
Yeah, Lester told me last night.
Think what we can do with $80,000.
I'm beginning to understand. I wouldn't
walk around the corner with you...
you murdering crook.
I didn't think you were
such a sentimental fool, Countess...
like the rest of the yokels in this town.
- You can't get away with this.
- Can't I?
I've heard about rats
deserting sinking ships...
but this is the first time I ever seen one.
Get out of my way, Uncle Willie.
You got me scared, but not for $80,000.
Get out of my way.
Let go.
- Quit.
- Just let loose of my arm. Let go!
- Let go, I tell you.
- No, I won't.
No, please, Mr. Lester. Don't come in!
- Get out of the way. Get back there.
- Put up your guns.
Put up your guns. No shooting.
Please, Mr. Lester, it's all new glassware.
- Shut up.
- Drinks on the house.
There she goes again.
Duck! Get out of the way, will you?
Hit the floor!
Watch out, Cheyenne.
Friendship.
There they are!
We'll have a couple of legal hangings
right here and now.
- Get them, boys!
- Wait a minute.
Nobody's going to be hanged.
The men that should've been
are beyond that now.
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't listen to him.
Get them while you got a chance.
Take it easy.
Especially you, Judge.
That's better.
Cheyenne's got a little story he's gonna tell,
and I want you to listen real careful.
Boys, I just caught Stanley Clanton lighting
out of town with the money from the bank.
I had to shoot him, and before he died,
he confessed.
He was in cahoots with Jack Lester
and robbing his own bank.
Here's all your money.
Do you, Bill Smith...
take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
And do you, Allison McLeod...
take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God has joined together
let no man put asunder.
Well, go ahead and kiss her.
Give her a little smack.
Dad.
- Mrs. Smith, best of luck to you.
- Thank you.
Well, wasn't it worth it, Willie?
Sure. I'm glad I confessed.
How was Bill gonna get a fresh start,
or Allison be made happy...
if I didn't clear the whole thing up?
And you ain't gonna be ashamed
of that honesty, Willie.
No, sir. Why, you're gonna get a quick,
fair, legal trial...
and not a day more than 20 years.
That's mighty fine of you, Judge.
What?
