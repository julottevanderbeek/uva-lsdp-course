I figured you'd get the idea it's time to get out.
Here.
Adios, farm boy.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Wait. Hey!
I sure didn't expect to see you back in that cantina.
Oh boy!!
Well - I get out here once or twice a year.
Do a little light steal'n.
What do you steal?
Oh horses - cows.
Yeah?
Watch them rocks.
Okay.
- Gold, Silver -
just about anything that I can herd or walk off with.
- Except sheep -
I hate those god damned sheep.
You couldn't GIVE me one of those woolly bastards!
Me too!      I --- I hate' em.
Well - you ever have any partners on this kind of stuff?
No, Thank You.
Well - I killed a man..
Well,  that ain't no high recommendation.
Well, he was a great big son of a bitch.
He's twice as big as me.
Old Sam Colt makes everybody just about the same size.
Well, I hit him with a stick.
I didn't use no Colt.
He's my brother-in-law - God Damn It!
Is that the nature of your trouble back there?
Yes sir.
Them two have in their mind to kill me,
and their daddy'll see that they do.
That's why I'm here.
Whoa.
You know how to use that hog leg there??
The what?
Your gun. You know how to use your gun?
Well --- oh
Oh!
Damn.
Shoot.
It's got sand in it, sorry.
Only three things to remember...
One - You point it - like yous point'n your finger.
... and two - You squeeze the trigger.
Like you was playing with your sore pecker.
You missed him..
I don't kill for amusement -- man or rabbit.
No sir.
What's three?
Three - Is you keep your feeted planted...
Till you done all the shoot'n you're gonna do.
Nothing makes a man more nervous
than to see somebody standing still...
When they ought to be runnin' like a spotted-ass ape.
Yes sir.
Well, I'll just follow your lead on that part of it.
Thank You
Not a problem.
Barbarosa - was he ever here?
yes,   yes.
We ain't gonna rob those poor old people, are we?
Poor People?
That's the way the rich travel around here.
Manos Arriba!
Oh, oh.
Goddamn it!
Give me your money.   Now, now!
Get their money, KARL.
Get your money out!
"pronto - pronto"
Come on!!
Get It, KARL!
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?
"Si - Señor"
That's all they got in the world!
Well, they got each other - take it!
No sir, I can't.
I ain't gonna.
Son of a bitch.
No sir, I ain't gonna?
What do you mean - No sir, I ain't gonna.
Uh,     I don't think it's right.
Goddamn it - boy - we ARE robbers!!!
These people -
probably got more Gold than we could ever carry!
I  think banks and trains is more my line
Well look at 'em!
God Damn Son Of A Bitch!
We don't need to be robb'in these people.
Why don't you -
go on their god damn mortgage while you're at it!
...and get Jesus to co-sign --- all right??
"hehe"
Poke my god damn eyes out!
If that don't beat anything I've ever seen.
God damn Robber "my ass"
"Barbarosa".
"Maldito!  Hey!"
Don't you ever do that to me again, farm boy.
You hear me?
You hear me?
Yes sir..
After all I got a reputation to maintain down here.
I thought you...
"Watch It"
I thought you wanted to rob and pillage anyway.
I do!
the next time we go out to rob,
I'm gonna make the selections on to what to rob.
If I say we're gonna steal horses, we'll steal horses.
If I say we're gonna steal cows, we'll steal cows.
If I say we're gonna rob beehives, you get...
...your own little bee swatter, and you swat some bees.
If I say -
"Buenos Días!"
You're on my road, amigos.
What are you doing on my road, huh?
I don't see no sign that says this is your road.
You see a sign, farm boy?
You ought to have a big sign up there says:
"THIS IS MY ROAD!"
Signs?
You know I have plenty of signs, just look around.
Maybe you just don't know who I am, huh?
Oh - I think I recognize you now.
You're Mr. Shit.
I'm Ángel Morales.
You know who I am?
Sí Señor - I know who you are.
"Oh - We MAY BE in trouble."
"Barbarosa."
"Karl Westoff."
Ya 'all shoulda gone home, like I told ya..
Come - Karl.
"What is he doing here?
We found them on our path.
Oh - did that surprise you?
Stand up, farm boy.
"Barbarosa."
huh!
It's them old people that yer so in love with.
Well I hope that makes you feel REAL bad...
to see all that Gold.
Amigo!
My mother says -
you stopped Barbarosa from taking my father's money?
That's what the little son of a bitch did alright...
I was gonna rob your feeble old papa;
and shoot that squawking old woman over there!
You son of a Bitch!
Cover him up!
Gonna take care of you later.
"Barbarosa's Dead!"
Shit!

Goddamn it, Stop that.
I thought you was dead.
Damn close!
Just tickled my innards a little - I think.
Is anybody watchin'?
No.
Amigo!
What's the matter?
You don't like to look at dead men?
No sir.
Lets just get out of here.
Okay?
They got our horses.
I don't care.
I'll walk.
No.  We ain't done here yet.
I'm gonna give that Mexican bandit
a proper farewell --- from Barbarosa.
"They got all our money!"
It's all gone!
Barbarosa's gone!
The grave is empty!
Dig me out of here!
Barbarosa's been here!
Evil!, Evil!
It's the devil's work.
Cursed!

"Barbarosa!"
Goddamn!
You know Mr. Pahmeyer's over here looking to kill me.

Careful - Yer kick'in rocks all over me!
Here - gimme your hand.

You said get rid of it.

I don't know what made me think you'd make a partner anyway.
Can't even catch a god-damn armadillo.

Aah!
"whooh"
Are you alright?
Shit No, I ain't all right!
Do I look all right?
Well you look better than you did...

Here.
But you didn't bring me no armadillo for my supper though...
did you - by God!
Suppose you want me to cut the sunofa-bitch for you too!
She showed up - a little while back.
We'll lay up here for a few days...
and then --- find you something to ride.
Good.
I could use a little rest.
Burro!    Burro!
Watch out.
Burro!    Burro!
I think I'm getting it.
Burro!    Burr-oh!
You could get along well on that gold.
Burro!
What the hell I need with Gold?
I get by on a few armadillos and a little gunpowder.
"Yah, ha, ha!"
This  is for Josephina.
Who's Josephina?  ------  "Burro".
She's my wife.
Wife?
You got a wife somewhere in Texas here?
She lives with her papa,
Don Braulio Zavala.
Where do you think she lives?
Christ Almighty ----- You married one of them.
Burro.
Burro.   Burro.
Burro.   Burro.
Why don't we take turns on this jackass.
Burro.
Damn song beat us back!
"EARLY THE NEXT MORNING,
THERE WAS A TERRIFYING CRY."
Well they ain't sing'in nothin about me!
Shhh!  Listen!
"MORALES AND BARBAROSA
TRADED PLACES IN THE EARTH..."
How bout that??
Oh, here - heres -
This is your part.
"DON BARBAROSA WAS TRAVELING WITH A GRINGO CHILD."
A Gringo  Child?
"AND THOUGH...
...THOUGH HE WAS ONLY A HALF PINT..."
"...HE MEASURED UP TO THE QUART."
That's pretty good!
"MEASURED UP TO THE QUART."
That ain't bad.
Son of a bitch can write..
"EARLY NEXT MORNING...
THEY TOOK THE GOLD AND SILVER."
"...AND HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE."
Good!
"...AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE COURAGE...
GREASE UP YOUR GUNS AND KNIVES."
What_?
That's the part where they kill Barbarosa.
Josephina...
Do you know how long it's been?
I come in the spring and I come in the fall.
I come when I can.
Yes - You come in the spring. You come in the fall.
In the meantime - I wait and wait and wait.
This hasn't been no bed of roses for me out there -
you know.
Don't tell me you don't like it.
Well - it varies.
Don't he ever get tired of that shit?
"Yes! Texax Rangers."
"One was a Captain."
No-oooh!
We should've killed 'em, Don Braulio.
That was 30 years ago.
He wanted to help us.
We thought that too!
"He played with our children...
...to make us love him."
Your OWN daughter - Don Braulio.
"We drank tequila."
"The gringo was rude."
"So we took him outside on the patio,
hoping he would sober up."
"I woke up in horror to see
the gringo standing there before me."
"the gringo's beard
that once had been the colour of honey..."
Barbarosa.
Barbarosa!
"He pointed his rifle at my knee;
then he pulled the trigger."
'
"He is the devil on earth."
"...then God will put us back into houses
---- made of sticks and mud!"
Don't yell or nothin!
You're the gringo child?
Yeah.
- Is Barbarosa here too?
- shhhh_ goddamn it.
It's alright... I won't say nothing.
they would try and kill him...
and you too - maybe.
yeah - I know.
Everything alright?
"Buenas Noches."
You wouldn't try and trick me - would you?
No.
Good night.    Is everything alright?
All is well?   Juanita?
Sí - Don Braulio.
Everything's fine.
Buenas Noches.
Buenas Noches.
Are you afraid?
Damn right - I'm afraid.
I'm afraid for Barbarosa.
Yes, me too.
I stay afraid.
Oh...
You take too many risks.
Don't you think we have enough?
No.
I don't wanna have to eat another armadillo
the rest of my life after we leave.
I wanna go with you this time..
Tonight!
Maybe next spring.
You just don't wanna take me with you, do you!
Who's gonna tend our baby?
"Our Baby!"
You haven't seen our baby -  lately.
Let's go see..
GOD Almighty Damn!
Ah! .
Time to go?
You're goddamn right!
It's time to go!
Wha --- Get out of here!  What's wrong?
Go! --- Get! --- Move!
You goddamned girl crazy son of a bitch!
Are all your brains in the head of your pecker?
What is wrong? --- What do you mean?
You know what's wrong!
Barbarosa.
Don Braulio.
Damn You!
For all this misery..
I know your game.
Have you not gotten what you wanted as well?
All I ever wanted was to be part of this family.
And now you are not a part of this family?
BARBAROSA!
BARBAROSA!       BARBAROSA!
BARBAROSA!
Come On, KARL - let's go..
I had no idea she was your daughter.
All we did was just talk - that's all.
... and I'll tell ya somethin' - I like her.
I like her a lot.
...and I intend to visit her again.
What do you think about that?
Oh, I think that's fine.
Well what are you so mad about?
Because you stole that goddamn horse,
and you stole it from the Zavalas.
Oh well look at you - look at you...
...Look what you're ta__...
You're talking about stealin'...
I don't steal from my... I don't steal  from my own people.
Well it don't bother you to slit their throats
on your weddin' night does it?
Where'd you hear that.
I heard Braulio tell it.
He said ya was drunk..
Hell we were all drunk.
Braulio saw to that.
Said ...
Said they threw you outside.
Yeah, they did that too.
Ay yah
What else did they say?
Well they said, you came back in...
...and killed Marcelo and Tomás.
You believe that?
Well he said, you shot his leg off.
did you do that?
Yes I did that one.
Why?
"Quiet"
It's just about what I had figured.
He's a Zavala.
Is he -  by God.
Hey!    Where you goin'.
What have you been--
Shhh_
Hey!
Watch.
Barbarosa.
BARBAROSA!
Hope you're happy -
got the little son of a bitch stirred up enough.
- Well he thinks it's you.
You will never catch me sleeping again!
Well I thought it'd scare him off.
This Zavala will kill you.
Old  Braulio may have finally grow'd one
"man" enough to do the job.
Why can't we just MOVE from this part of the country.
Move?
Yeah.
That's my family over there.
BARBAROSA!
Looky there - winter's comin'.
Ohh.
Imagine my daddy's ...
...out there in his field, right now - plowin'.
You miss all that?
Don't do me no good to miss it.
Does it.
I wonder what they're doin' over there.
That's a horse auction.
They have it every year - here on Abrazos.
I've always wanted to get down here.
They got farm equipment, good barbecue.
Really?
I don't come up here much;
it's a little bit too closed in for me.
They got a horse race goin' here.
Come On!
Come On! Come On!
Yah Ha Ha!
I'd like to get in on some of that.
Come On! - If you're waitin' on me...
...you're wastin' time.
Okay. That's five dollars.
Five dollars over here.
Five dollars bid on these fine animals.
That's a pretty good-lookin' piece of meat.
Thanks.
Yeah, make it big.
I'm gonna enjoy this...
Thank-You.
You get some coffee?
Yeah - I got some coffee.
About time we found something like this.
Huh?
I said it's about time we found something like this.
You really know your horses.
Yeah, I do..
Always thought to have some one day, you know.
ALL MY BOYS are DEAD!!!
You killed them.
Goddamn you Karl!
What the hell's goin' on?
Pahmeyer!    Bandits killed em down in Mexico.
I didn't have noth'in to do with it.
I never meant to kill August - neither.
Mr. Pahmeyer?
What the hell's goin' on?
Stop!   Somebody's gonna get killed!
Mr. Pahmeyer!
Mr. Pahmeyer!
You wanna talk now?
Mr. Pahmeyer?
For Christ's sake don't let the son of a bitch reload,
Karl - goddamn it!
One of us is gonna get killed!
Now, I ain't gonna miss next time.
Go on home.
Go on.
Co on home.
That old man will think a long time,
before he tries that again.
Heyah! Heyah!
Come On!
Where do you think we ought to go now?
Ain't no "we" KARL.
I'm goin' on alone from here..
Alone?
What do you mean alone?
What's the matter with me...
Ain't I been good company?
Well I ain't gonna lie to you, you know.
I'm getting all wore out trying to keep you entertained
Here, take that home with ya.
I want to think about it a minute.
Think about it, hell.
You got family; go on home.
Ain't you learned nothin' bein' with me?
What are ya gonna do?
Think I'll go over and see Josephina.
Got a little money saved up.
Might head up toward Colorado.
I remember once you told me you'd never leave.
Yeah - well after 30 years,
I'm getting kinda tired of this shit.
Think it's about time to let go of ol "Barbarosa".
Good Luck, KARL.
Good Luck to you, sir.
Hilda?
Hilda?
Sister?
Sister,
Look up here.
It's KARL.
Daddy?
Dad?
I'm here dad.
I hear ya.
It's me.
It's your boy.
Karl?
Karl.
Where the goddamn hell have you been?
People round here kinda froze us out.
Hilda ain't been able to find much reason to wanna keep going.
Truth is son --- I've been in the same frame of mind.
Haw!  hah!   hah!   heyah!
Horses.
Yeah.
We don't belong here.
What's got you spooked?
It's these damned woods - huh?
Mornin' sister.
Good mornin'.
Mornin', Daddy.
Mornin'.
Good to see ya up.
How do you feel?
Yeah.    Better..
Well, you eat good...
...damn if Sims and I...
are gonna want to break all them horses on our own.
Where'd you get the money - Karl?
What money?
For the Horses...
...and for all this other.
Well, I had some luck down in Mexico...
...me and another fellow.
uh-oh
Where you goin'?
I wanna see our horses.
Oh, y'all hear that?    "Our Horses."
Daddy I think you gotta break a couple of them
before it's "OUR HORSES."
What's the matter??
Give me -- Give me a hand here, Karl.
Sure, come on, come on.
Let me show you.
Will you get that door for us - sister?
Hello the house!
Mr. Pahmeyer!
We got business!
You just as well come on out!
I'm --- I'm sorry about Emil.
I never meant Emil.
I know that.
They were my sons - Karl!
Damn fine sons!
All three of 'em.
I'll make a bargain with you.
Let's just quit this thing.
I don't know that...
...I'm able to do it - Karl.
Well think about it - before you commit yourself.
Yeah - you might be right - Karl.
I'll think about it - this minute.
Heaven Help Us!  --- Nein!
Heavens - Papa!
No!!
Well, You're a sad lookin' son of a bitch!
Yeah.
I've been wonderin' what happened to ya.
Right arm banged up a bit...
nothin' to worry about.
That Zavala boy?
Little son of a bitch was up in a tree this time.
Ain't enough I gotta watch behind the rocks and bushes.
Now I gotta watch up in the trees.
Well it's sure good to see ya.
What happened to your people?
Well I lost 'em both.
My dad and my sister.
Well, we ain't waitin' on me.
Well we ain't waitin' on me either.
Now Listen, I been thinkin'.
Why don't you go into town and get some supplies...
...some salt, beans...
...maybe a little stick candy...
something to suck on.
Where you gonna be?
I'm goin' up to the camp here.
I'll be up the road a ways.
Now, wait a minute.
You're not gonna run off and leave me again - are ya?
Oh, no.
Been seein' - you don't do too well by yourself.
Go on now.
I can "feel" you breathin' boy!
Well Good Mornin' to you sir..
You plan to kill me today?
Today.
Now.
I don't even know your name - boy..
I am Eduardo.
Oh yeah,
You're Pedro's son.
I can see the resemblance.
Crencencio - he was my father.
Crecencio!
How is the old bugger?
He's dead!
Don't tell me that..
You killed him years ago..
You shot him here..
...and you killed Manual, Luis, Alemán...
...Cuco,  Lorenzo.
Damn Good Men!
There are others.
Yeah --- there's gonna be one more.
If you don't step aside.
You haven't got enough "ass" in your britches...
...to pull the trigger on Barbarosa!
You're gonna look funny
with your brains blowin' out your ears.
I can do it.
Who's gonna help your old mama around the house?
Who's gonna dally with the girls?
It won't be you.
Throw your rifle away from ya.
Throw It!
Now your pistola.
I should've slit your throat rather than your hat...
that night you were sleeping.
That was you!
Sit your butt down and take off your boots!
Right now.   Now!
Bullshit.
So --- Barbarosa got to have the gringo child
give him some help these days - huh?
Shut your mouth!  You don't know nothin'
about me bein' here.
You just get your boots off and pitch 'em over there
with your weapons.
You can't take an old man's death away.
Old man?   Hell!
I looked into his face.
It's tired and worn.
He's just an old man.
He's Barbarosa!
You go back and tell your people Barbarosa's just a man!
Go on!

Karl?
Is that you - Karl?
Eduardo   ---  No!
Barbarosa!
Barbarosa?
Barbarosa.
They killed me this time.
Stay with me awhile?
Karl
They cut my damned ears off!
Oh God Damn!
Your Ears!
Braulio did that.
Him and the other two.
On your weddin' night?
Yeah.
I shot his leg off for it.
I'm surprised you didn't kill him.
He wanted to fix it so I'd leave Josephina.
But I never did leave her - Karl.
No sir - you didn't.
You got a lot to be proud of.
you know that?
Eduardo?
Uh.
Just some spots of blood - that's all.
He's on his way home to spread the news.
"Barbarosa's Dead!"
He's afoot.
I'm gonna catch him...
...make sure he never reaches home with that story.
Alright?
I swear it.
The old bastard will just keep - havin'  them look for me.
Barbarosa will live a long time in that family.
...A Long Time.
Don't let 'em find my body - Karl.
They won't.
Karl -
Eduardo
Eduardo!
Eduardo.
I am returned - Don Braulio..
And uh...
...and Barbarosa?
Barbarosa is Dead!
He is dead.
I killed him with my knife.
You uh...
...you bring no proof..
Where are his cojones?
I am the proof.
I would not have come back if I had not done this thing.
"Barbarosa is Dead!".
I swear it Don Braulio.
Barbarosa...
is dead.
Barbarosa ---  is dead!
Eduardo has killed him.
Prepare for a great fiesta in celebration.
