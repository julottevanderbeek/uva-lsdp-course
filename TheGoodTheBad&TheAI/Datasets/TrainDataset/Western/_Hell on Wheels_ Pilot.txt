Priest: Unburden
yourself, my son.
I was with General Sherman
on his march south.
What we did...
Evil... unspeakable things.
You were a soldier.
You were
following orders.
No.
No, not just orders.
We opened a dark door...
And the devil stepped in.
The only way to
cast out the devil...
Is to confess to God.
No.
No, I can't, father.
Tell me about Meridian.
How do you know
about Meridian?

==SPREAD THE WORD==
A nation which nearly
destroyed itself by Civil War
between north and south
can only be healed
by the binding together
of east and west.
Mark my words, gentlemen,
it will be built.
The only question
which remains is...
Which one of you will join
me in this mad, noble quest?
Who among you will have
to say in years hence
that he stood idly by as
this nation became an empire?
And who among you will be
able to say he lent a hand
in making manifest our
destiny as a great nation?
Here, here.
Bravo.
It's all horse crap.
The faster I shovel,
the faster they eat it up.
But it was a truly
inspirational speech.
Twattle and shy, I say.
Then why am I here?
You are here
to play your part.
Credit mobilier.
Credit mobilier
will be awarded
all major construction contracts
on the Union Pacific railroad.
I own it.
I'm giving you the chance
to get in on the ground floor.
So, you'll be
paying yourself
to build a railroad with
government subsidies.
Now that, my friend,
is inspirational.
Yes, it is, but...
I can't afford these
on a senator's salary.
As head of the
congressional oversight
committee on railroads,
I'm sure you will
find a way to pay
for them over and over
and over again.
Might I ask how many
shares are here?
find that's fair.
Are you trying
to renegotiate a bribe?
No. Bribe is such
a dirty word. Hmm?
Why don't you think
on it, doc, hmm?
Ahem. We've got
to vote before the
committee next Tuesday.
Good luck with your land
speculation in Nebraska.
Oh, 50,000 acres bought
on the cheap, hmm?
What would happen
to the value of that land
if I decided to route
the railroad around it?
Take the stocks, Jordan.
But I've decided
to renegotiate.
"He was
gun... gunned... who...
While he paaa...
Pr... pr...
Per...
Prayed.
I... I was getting it.
"Prayed...
In the con...
Conf...
Conference.
Prayed
in the conference?
Confessional.
Someone killed
the poor bugger whilst
he was confessing?
What is the world
coming to, eh?
Well, I suppose
the only consolation
is that he got to heaven
that much faster.
How did you come
by that conclusion?
Well, he confessed
his sins.
He died in Grace.
So... God just up and punches
his ticket to heaven, huh?
Well, yeah.
If that's how God goes
about his business,
you can keep him.
Keep God?
Do you not believe
in a higher power?
Yes, sir, I wear it
on my hip.
Are you a gunslinger then?
No.
I was just heading out west,
looking for work
on the railroad.
Yeah, so are we.
To seek our fortune,
as it were.
I'm Mickey and
this here's Sean.
Cullen Bohannon.
Mickey has 12 toes.
And Sean but 8.
Individually,
we're freaks.
But together,
we're whole.

Next.
Name?
Cullen Bohannon.
Railroad experience?
None.
Why should I hire you?
I'm willing to do
just about anything.
Uh-huh, you and
a thousand others.
I ain't got no place
else to go, sir.
Save it.
Will you work the cut crew?
Yeah.
Yeah?
What's the cut crew?
Oh, it's brutal work.
It is not for
the faint of heart.
It gets hotter than a whore
house on nickel night out there.
I ain't afraid
of hard work.
You're a Johnny reb,
aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I could tell by that
griswold you're carrying.
It was a griswold like
that that took off my hand.
We all paid a price,
Mr. Bohannon,
and I imagine you bare
your own scars.
I was a copperhead
before the war.
So, I... I bear no hard feelings
towards you graybacks.
You did what you had to do.
It's the darkies I blame.
The way I see it, they only
fire more than just a hand.
Say, did you own
slaves, Mr. Bohannon?
I did.
Well, then... I imagine you know
your way around a n.
This is Mr. Bohannon...
Your walking boss.
You can address him as boss
or boss man or walking boss.
Mr. Bohannon is a
former master of slaves.
Some things don't never change.
So, he's up to your tricks.
He's going to work the blue
out of your gums, boys.
Any coffee boilers or
otherwise slack work ethic
will be dealt with severely.
Now, dig me a cut.
** Pass me not,
o gentle savior **
Jesus Christ, accept this humble
servant into your heart.
** Hear my humble cry
** while on others
thou art calling... **
be reborn...
In the glory of Jesus.
** Do not pass me by
** savior...
Brother Joseph... your
sins are washed away.
** Hear my humble cry
** Oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** oh, what a beautiful city
** 12 gates to the city...
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, boy.
** There's 3 gates
in the east **
** there's 3 gates
in the west **
right here.
** There's 3 gates
in the north **
I love the tent.
** And there's 3 gates
in the south... **
raise the church.
In this den
of thieves,
I shall build a
house of the lord.
You putting up
a church here?
What better place to convert
the wicked, sister.
** Won't you do
this kind of favor... **
you better keep an eye
on your flock, reverend.
We do our own share of
convertin' around here.
** Please tell my mother
why have you made
my roads so straight?
Are we not in a race
with the central pacific?
The central pacific?
Those imbeciles
will never make it
out of Sacramento.
They're so desperate, I hear
they're hiring chinks.
What I was thinking... was
something more like... this.
But we're building
over a flat land,
why wouldn't
we make it straight?
Why wouldn't we make it
straight he asks?
Take a closer look.
Uh!
Let me elucidate.
In case you haven't
heard, this undertaking
is being subsidized by
the enormous teat of
the federal government.
This never-ending,
money-gushing nipple
pays me
$16,000 per mile,
yet, you build
my road straight!
You're fired.
Get out.
I said, get out.
You look like
a bright young man.
This land...
It's bewitching.
It hasn't changed
since Lewis and Clark
first saw it 60 years ago.
Do you ever wonder
if our work here will...
Will be the ruin
of all of this?
Progress comes
with a cost, lily.
I just think it's
so much more beautiful
without people.
Don't fool yourself.
There are plenty
of people here.
We're entering
Cheyenne territory.
You do remember
our agreement?
You mean our agreement
to regarding
my not leaving your side
while you were ill?
No.
Ahem.
I mean, our agreement
that you should go back
to Chicago once we entered
hostile Indian territory.
Yes, my dear, but it was
before you took ill.
Yeah.
I believe our
second agreement
supersedes our first.
Oh, dear God, now you
sound like a lawyer.
If you want me to go
to Chicago... lead the way.
I'm not leaving
without you, Robert.
Don't tempt me, lily.
I might just do it.
You play me for dumb.
Ahh, you've worked
for this for too long
to go back now.
We've worked at this.
This... this would
mean nothing to me
if you weren't
here to share it.
Robert Bell, are you hiding
something in your trousers?
It must be all
this fresh air.
Mmm.
Mmm. Breathe deeply.
So, uh, how many
slaves did you own?
I had me a small
tobacco farm.
Any women?
You ever, uh...
Sample the goods?
Uh-uh.
It wasn't like that.
Call.
You, uh... bitter that
you had to give up your slaves?
I gave them their
freedom a year before
the war started.
Are you serious?
I kept them on at wages.
Ha ha.
You are an odd duck,
Bohannon.
I married a northerner.
She convinced me
of the evils of slavery.
So, you... you
released your slaves,
yet you still
fought in the war.
Why?
Honor.
The southerner
and his honor.
Where is your wife now?
She's dead.
Did the war take her?
Something like that.
Think they heard us?
Who cares?
I don't want to torment
the poor bastards
out here alone in the
middle of nowhere.
They have their hands.
Ohh.
Shh. Shh.
Shh.
I feel this cough is going
to be the death of me.
Nonsense.
Nonsense.
Lily... if I were
to die...
Robert... please... please
don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.
Oh!
The map.
We have to save
their work.
Run to the trees.
Don't look back.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Uhh!
Uh!
No, please no.
Ah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Robert!
Rise and shine, Bohannon.
It's another beautiful day
on the railroad.
Get up!
Uhh.
Get up! Come on!
Whoa.
My horse.
All right, lad.
Half-hour to lunch!
Half-hour!
Peckerwood.
He ain't so bad.
Shut your dumb
black ass up.
I don't need no slave
boss motivatin' me.
Mm-hmm.
Come on!
Help me out here.
** All them pretty gals
gonna be there **
** shuck that corn
before you eat **
come on!
Come on!
I say... ** all them pretty
gals gonna be there **
** shuck that corn
before you eat **
** they gonna fix it
for us rare **
** shuck that corn
before you eat **
** I know that supper
gonna be big **
** shuck that corn
before you eat **
** I think I smell
a fire roast pig **
** shuck that corn
before you eat **
man: Keep it going.
** I hope they got
some whiskey there **
You might want to take
a look at this.
Put it in the pile.
No, sir.
You really need
to look at this.
Dear God.
Robert Bell is dead?
Is this
the entire message?
Yes, sir.
Nothing about...
Maps being found?
No, sir.
One last telegram.
To the Union Pacific board
of directors... change of plans.
Stop. Heading for hell
on wheels immediately. Stop.
Send it.
You need some water.
No, it ain't... it ain't
break time yet.
Come on, you need
some water. Come on.
Come on.
Unh.
I thought I told you to dump
that dirt on the other side.
Hey.
Shut your mouth.
I told him to do it.
We going to fill in that
dip over yonder next.
I figured we might just use
some field dirt nearby.
You talk to me before any
decisions are made, all right?
Yes, sir, master.
What did you say?
Bohannon, what the hell
is going on here?
You drink when
I tell you to drink!
Uh!
Get up!
Willy! Willy! Willy!
Willy!
This is what happens
when you break my rules.
Now, what you planning
on doing with that Arkansas
toothpick, huh?
Don't do it.
We ain't on no plantation
no more... walking boss.
Ain't nothing good
gonna come from this.
Yeah.
Well, there ain't
nothing good coming
from this either.
That dumb n
actually thought
this was gonna
changed a thing.
Look what that got him.
Might just as well
wipe my ass with it.
You kill him...
You will hang.
How they gonna hang me if
there ain't no witnesses?
You come to me
with a knife, son...
You better be ready to use it.
Yeah.
You got to let
go of the past.
Have you let it go?
You doing quite a trade here.
Not bad for a couple
of Irish bumpkins.
Where's Mickey?
He's preparing
for the grand finale.
** When you're far away
** far from the land
you'll be **
do you not pine
for your own homeland,
Mr. Bohannon?
No.
And why is that?
It's gone.
** Bright and fair
** and rich in its treasures
** Muldoon
** Won't you come back soon
** love you
So, tell me, Bohannon...
Did you see the elephant
during the war?
Yes, I saw my share
of action, yeah.
Where?
Yeah. I don't like
to talk about it.
I loved the war.
I loved the war!
The best thing that
ever happened to me.
I thought you said
you were against it?
Oh, yeah, I was.
But... that
doesn't mean...
That I didn't
enjoy myself once
pressed into service.
Hey!
Oh, hey,
I'm... I'm skimped.
No, no. This one's on me.
Well... well, thank you.
Most men shrink...
When they see
the elephant up close.
Oh, yeah?
But I... I blossomed.
Thank you.
Though I...
I must admit that
there were, um...
Certain lines
that I crossed.
Lines of morality that
I didn't think myself
capable of crossing.
But that's
what men do... in war.
Hmm.
Moral men don't.
So, you did nothing that
you were ashamed of?
I did plenty I was ashamed of.
You ever been to Meridian,
Mississippi, Mr. Johnson?
That is my remington
pointed at your gut.
So... let's take
a walk out back.
I know about the 2 men
you killed in Maryland.
I read in the paper
about Prescott
getting killed in that
church by a griswold.
But I'll be damned
if you didn't show up
a few days later with
a griswold strapped to
your hip as plain as day.
And then you ask me about
Meridian? That's sensitive.
Mmm! I am not proud
of what happened
to your wife, Bohannon.
It didn't happen to her.
You did it to her.
Yes. Yes,
we did it to her.
I did it to her.
Your wife was
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
I want you to know...
It wasn't my idea
to kill her.
She hung herself?
No, she didn't.
The sergeant strangled
her and strung her up.
Sergeant?
What sergeant?
Well,
he's out here, too.
I figured you were
saving him for last.
Oh, you didn't
know about it?
You tell me who he is.
Well, it hardly
matters now.
No!
Tell me his name.
Tell me his name.
Is it a villain you want?
I'll play the part.
After all,
what is a drama
without a villain?
What is the building of this
grand road if not a drama?
This business is not
for the weak of heart.
It's a thorny,
brutal affair
that rewards the lion
for his ferocity.
What of the zebra?
What of the poor zebra?
Well, the zebra's eaten
as the zebra should be.
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.
Lives will be lost.
Fortunes will be made.
Men will be ruined.
There will be
betrayal and scandal.
A perfidy
of epic proportions.
But... the lion
shall prevail.
You see, the secret
I know is this...
All of history
is driven by the lion.
We drag the poor zebra
kicking and braying.
Stain the earth
with his cheap blood.
History doesn't
remember us fondly,
but then history is written
by the zebra for the zebra.
When this railroad
spans the continent
and America rises
to be the greatest power
the world has seen...
I will be remembered
as a caitiff...
Malefactor...
Who only operated out of
greed for personal gain.
All true. All true.
But remember this...
Without me...
And men like me,
your glorious railroad
would never have been built.
