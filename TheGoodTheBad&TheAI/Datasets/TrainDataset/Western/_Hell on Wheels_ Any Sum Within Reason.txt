Previously on
AMC's "Hell on Wheels."
The assassin was a white man.
Pity the only witnesses were Chinese.
Where can I find a dress like that?
My request for a stake
is non-negotiable.
Get the men back to work today.
Men in America are compensated
based upon their value.
your railroad will not
move another inch.
You're in danger.
Chang work for rebel
leader in San Francisco.
I belong to them.
This America...
Ain't nobody belongs to nobody.

From here on out,
you deliver Tao's back pay
to the railroad office.
Some hongcha, Mr. Bohannon?
I'll pay out Fong's wages myself.
Your concern for your
workers is admirable.
Wages delivered to my office.
Every week without exception.
One day we'll have to do this over
tea like respectable businessmen.
Where'd you get this?
Chang knows, doesn't he?
I bought you a seat on
the first coach out.
Leaves town in 20 minutes,
and you need to be on it.
I no leave town.
Ain't nobody knows the terrain
better than Stagecoach Mary.
She'll see you safe to Cheyenne.
- Cheyenne?
- There's a woman there, Maggie Palmer.
She's a friend. You'll be safe there.
I'm safe here!
He see us in a tent, it no mean...
His whore was wearing
your mother's dress.
I give to her.
Well, Chang's on the scent.
He'll follow it straight to
your contract with the Sze Yup.
I'll come for you soon just
as soon as I deal with Chang.
We stay and fight Chang together.
Ain't no fighting our way out of this.
Kill Chang, start a
war with the Sze Yup.
I want life with you.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You ain't safe here.
I love you.
You don't get it.
Hey! Listen.
You need to run from this place,
fast and as far as you can
before death catches up with you.
You hear me?
It will.
It always does.
Tea still in box.
It's one coach ride.
Never just one.
STAGECOACH MARY: Time to go.
You'll hit Nevada before nightfall.
You telegraph word from Reno.
Mei, um...
Got a schedule, railroad man.
Be sure you stick to it, Mary.
This stuff is more addictive than
that midnight oil you sell next door.
The food you're enjoying was
shipped fresh in the cargo hold
of my company's five clipper
ships and 10 lorchas.
They're sitting there
waiting to be used.
I don't doubt the extent of the
resources at your disposal, sir.
It's me you doubt.
My business.
I've turned a blind eye until now.
If you're gonna haul freight to
Asia for the Central Pacific,
I need a deeper understanding
of the man representing me.
My intention is to read about
my business in the same papers
I read about yours, Mr. Huntington.
You're a whore minder, sir,
and a peddler of opiates.
As well as a fine chef.
The single largest business in Asia
began by smuggling opium into China.
The day you grow as big
as Jardine Matheson
is the day I cut out my tongue
and allow you serve it
as your daily special.
Shovel salesman yesterday,
railroad tycoon today.
American capitalism is a sturdy ladder.
A ladder that doesn't breach
the walls of Chinatown.
Then I'll knock them down.
You know, there's a saying about
the first one through the wall.
I am not afraid of bloodshed.
I'll need more duck, Mr. Chang.
Absolutely.
- Here.
- Here?
Nosey little man, ain't you?
Next time,
ask.
Your fare already paid and then some.
$2 for dress.
You got a lady waiting
on you in Cheyenne?
$5.
- I paid 10.
- Paid who?
Ain't for sale.
Everything for sale.
$20.
Hop in.
Reno waits.
- Wait too long already.
- Get in.
It's time to consider
workforce for the future.
You got a taste for firing
and you want another one?
Chief Mandarin.
Man I know back East,
name of Mickey McGinnes,
can have us a thousand Irishmen out
here by the time we hit the desert.
Mr. Chang provides invaluable
services for this road.
Skimming wages, organizing strikes,
killing my foreman. Yeah,
you're right. That...
Hard to put a price on
those kinds of services.
Chinese business.
Chang's never betrayed me.
You don't need Chang.
You like him.
His clothes, his food, his accent.
- You're mesmerized.
- You overstep, sir.
The future is in China, Mr. Bohannon.
We're not building a
railroad, Mr. Bohannon.
We're building a bridge.
Across the great land of ours
linking Europe and the Orient.
Now, you either adapt and profit,
or fight it and perish.
Railroad's completion is upon us, sir.
You need to start planning
for what lies ahead,
what lies beyond that final rail.
Chang's still on after she's built,
don't count me in your plans.
CULLEN: I'm aware of your
intention to reclaim
the Sze Yup Company
contract on Mei Fong.
I'm here to purchase that
contract at fair market value.
Any price within reason, Mr. Chang.
Simply name it.
A cut-rate prostitute can
earn me $4,000 a year.
A prized one like Wai-Ling,
$6,000.
Six thousand, cash, tomorrow.
Annually.
Wai-Ling's made me
$30,000 in five years.
The suppleness of her breasts,
the slender size of her waist,
the length and form of her legs,
all these factors predict the healthy
earning years a prostitute earns.
Forty thousand.
That's five there and you'll have
rest by the end of the week.
The extra 10 is for your insurance
that Fong is free and clear.
Are you in love with her?
If the price ain't fair, son, name one.
I named my price months ago.
A 2% stake in the railroad.
When I did, you laughed in my face.
You refused to sell me a
piece of your business.
I refuse to sell you a piece of mine.
She ain't property, Chang.
Your workers come in cargo
holds and leave in coffins.
Tell me, how exactly do you calculate
fair compensation for being
vaporized by nitroglycerin?
Every businessman places
a value on human life.
I'm only alive today because you've accurately
assessed my worth to your railroad.
You ain't never gonna find her.
Surely you're not willing
to jeopardize everything
for one measly whore.
Hmm?
I've been waiting for you to show up.
So far,
I've been disappointed.
Do not misjudge me.
Do not misjudge how far my company
will go to claim what's theirs.
Can I help you, sir?
Said can I help you.
-
-
Each of you take a
building. Search every inch. Find her.
I'm looking for a young man named Fong.
He may have come through
here in the past hour.
Boom's over.
Town's been empty for weeks.
I mean you no harm, sir.
A railroad worker absconded
with a piece of my property
and I simply wish to
reclaim what is mine.
A man came through hour ago,
bought a meal,
moved on pretty quick.
CHANG: In which direction?
East, I think.
Out the back. Go.
CHANG: Mr. Bohannon.
Finally.
There you are.
Sumbitch.
Mr. Bohannon, I...
Wait here.
CULLEN: You need to rest.
MEI: Mmm-mmm. We need keep moving.
Train from Truckee take
me to San Francisco.
Ship leave Gold Mountain to China
to a mission in Ningpo.
You'll stay with me.
We'll get through the tunnel and
move on from Truckee together.
Safer to run, far as I can...
You're safe here.
Chang dead.
More Sze Yup to come.
They'll leave the same as Chang.
You've seen me now.
The man that I am.
You've seen me long time ago.
Stop here.
You went to see Chang's whore.
Wai-Ling was Chang's slave.
She gave you up to him.
Chang take her life,
her freedom, her honor.
She give up much more than me.
I owned slaves.
I can't shake it, Mei.
I see you.
You good.
You good.
You good.
You don't leave this
room until I get back.
Mei?
You hear me?
It never stop.
Well, it stops now.
This life mine.
I no want for you.
Mei.
I told you I lost everybody I ever had.
All right. That was a lie.
The people I loved,
I didn't lose them.
I let 'em go.
But as soon as I got that
telegram from you, I knew...
Mei...
I love you.
I love you, Cullen.
Lock the door.
COLLIS: Mr. Bohannon,
this is General Lee Yong, with the
Sze Yup Company in San Francisco.
He has just informed me that
Mr. Chang has been murdered.
Mr. Chang was tracking a
runaway whore in Washoe City
when he and his men were
gunned down in cold blood.
White assassin.
I may know the man responsible.
A white assassin came to town and
killed my foreman a few months back,
shot him point blank in Chinatown.
Maybe it was the same guy.
Y'all fight wars to keep
your whores, right?
Perhaps Chang's death was due to a
dispute over the value of this woman.
Please inform the General the Central
Pacific hopes that Mr. Chang's death
doesn't need to interrupt a long business
relationship between our companies.
You wouldn't jeopardize your entire
business for one man, would you?
The General says the Sze Yup's services
will continue without interruption.
He will send one of his
best company men, Ling Lee.
He speak English?
You'll find him of equal use
and value to you as Mr. Chang.
COLLIS: Ah, it's truly a shame.
Mr. Chang was a
forward-thinking businessman.
Chang pimp.
Taiping rebel.
Nothing more.
Half our workforce could've
walked out that door just now.
General himself says
Chang can be replaced.
Yeah.
You said the same thing three days ago.
Now, here we stand
learning Chang has been dispensed of.
Three days you were out of town.
You wanna ask me something, best ask.
Did you have a hand in Chang's murder?
The wounds this world
left on my soul
Mei, open up, it's me.
Mei?
