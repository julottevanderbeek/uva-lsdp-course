Two little princesses
Dancing in a row
Spinning fast and freely
on their little toes
Where the night will take you
There's only one way to know...
Two little princesses dancing in a row...
A storm is coming.
A storm is coming...
We're backing up in here.
And I only got two hands, Carter.
Where the hell's DG?
Carter's looking for you. He's mad.
He's not the only one.
DG!
Sorry, Carter.
Bad enough Evie's got to run
and take care of that potato-head son
of hers during the lunch rush,
now you're perfecting
the art of being late.
Carter! Guy on four wants a slice
of French apple and a chunk of Cheddar.
It won't happen again.
A lot of people would fight
for a job like this.
Your future's in the here and now, kid.
Don't throw it away.
Right. I've seen the line
stretching across the prairie
for this stepping stone.
Fella who wanted pie asked
for you special, DG. Table four.
What, you just going to stand there?
Go. Go, go.
This isn't my day.
Sure isn't.
Thank you.
Oh, for God's sakes!
That bad, popsicle?
Barometer's falling, the wind's rising,
and I can't get these
new turbines to throw a watt.
The spinner in Milltown was
never as complicated as this.
Well, everything's
better in Milltown, right?
Well, I did have to walk three miles
through the snow to get to school.
Heard you tossing and turning
again last night.
Oh, yeah.
Your creepy cave nightmare again?
Yeah, it was different this time.
I wasn't alone. There was a woman there.
She had the most beautiful
lavender eyes I've ever seen.
Liz Taylor?
No, here. Actually, I drew a picture of her.
Whoa...
She could escort me
through my dreams any night.
She said, uh, "A storm is coming."
What storm?
I don't know. I'll ask
for clarification next time.
Oh, ho-ho-ho! All right!
Elmer Gulch
is a menace to the community.
Menace or no, he is an officer of the law.
You're gonna have to face the judge.
Officer Gulch wants you in jail.
He doesn't want me in jail.
He wouldn't have
anybody to chase then.
This is not a joke. We'll be lucky
if they just impound your bike.
Then can't impound my bike
if I take off on it.
I was wondering if you were
planning a trip.
You went through my stuff?
She's been worried. We both have.
You've been acting strange, distant.
If you spend your every spare moment
drawing your pictures,
dreaming of another life,
you're gonna wind up
never living the one you got.
But this isn't my life.
This town, that job taking
other people's orders,
that's just passing time.
There has to be more to life than this.
And you really think you'll find better
out there?
Look, I love you guys,
I just don't feel at home here.
I don't think I ever have.
Our job in this world has been to be
the best parents that we can be.
And it's one we've done proper.
But she's a young woman now.
DG is having the dream.
Knock, knock!
You know your mom loves you
more than anything in this world.
I know.
I just...wish that
she understood how I felt.
You know, you're as good an artist
as you are a mechanic.
The world's going to be your oyster...
someday.
I remember when I was in Milltown...
Dad, could you please stop talking about
your perfect chiIdhood in Milltown?
This is real life.
Harass your old man all you want.
These sketches remind me of home.
No matter where we find ourselves,
home is where your heart is.
I can't stay here forever.
There's a place and a time
when we learn where
we're supposed to be.
And you're almost there...
And...
don't forget, all of life's answers...
Are found along the old road.
I remember.
The one about the daughter of light
who searches for her home...
Frozen in time on a sea of ice.
You got to get some new material, Dad.
And you've got to realize
that I'm not a little girl anymore.
You'll always be my baby girl.
General...my search teams have returned
from the Northern Guilds empty-handed.
She will be less than happy.
She always is.
You made me a promise.
Unfortunately, there were complications
with the resistance spies in the North.
A slight delay, Sorceress. That's all.
The emerald, Lonot.
Where's my emerald?
We will double our efforts,
close the vice even tighter.
All I need is a little more time.
There is no more time.
In seven days, the double eclipse
will darken our skies.
If I don't have the emerald
in my hand by then,
everything I have worked so hard for...
all of this...
will be lost.
We will have it before then.
I give you my word.
Something wrong, Sorceress?
I need to see Lylo.
Peer into the future.
Tell me if there's anything
that will hinder my plans.
It hurts Lylo to look.
It will hurt more if you don't.
Those who resist you
will continue to be conquered.
The emerald, Lylo.
Will I find it in time?
Where is it?
Lylo knows not.
But before the eclipse,
in your hand it will be.
It will be!
Do you see anything
that will stand in my way?
Lylo see nothing.
But...
But what?
Lylo feels...
a presence.
A...a glimmer of light
in the darkness.
Light from the other side.
The other side?
General Lonot...
awaken a travel storm.
Take a small company of men,
and just slip through to the other side.
Find this light
and extinguish it.
A storm is coming!
A storm is coming...
Wind must be
shorting out the power.
Where is she?
Ow, ow!
Dad! Are you OK?
No, DG, go back!
Ow! Ow!
Go, go, go!
Ah!
Dad, come on!
Get this thing off me!
Dad, are you OK?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Turn this around.
Push it down the stairs. Yeah.
Go, go!
Dad, who were those guys?
Longcoats.
What?
This wasn't the way it was planned.
I know, but it's our only chance!
We have to take her there now!
Take me where?
There's no time to explain, DG.
Dad, what are you doing?
Trust me!
You have to jump!
No!
You have to jump!
No!
We need to go, DG!
The Longcoats are after you!
What? Why?
Because it's time!
Time for what?
What are you doing?
You have to trust us!
Mom!
Dad!
Where am I?
Hello?
Hello!
Beware...
Oh, you have to be kidding me.
Watchful. Be watchful.
I like not the look of her.
Back off, Jack!
And gaze not into her eyes,
for fear she'll turn you into a skree.
Who are you?
I'm DG. Who are you?
I am Red Hatt.
We are resistance fighters
of the Eastern Guild.
Do not speak of who we be.
We know not of her trickery.
Trickery?
My parents are missing.
I'm the victim of some sort
of a natural disaster.
Creatures do not fall
from the sky lacking magic.
Mobats fall from the sky.
Mobats have wings!
Wings or not, she's a spy!
A spy from the sky!
No, I'm not a spy.
I'm not a spy.
Get her to the camp.
Stop your worrying.
Of course the people of the O.Z.
will be taken care of.
I never said that.
You did. No, you didn't.
Don't say that.
Perhaps we should return.
Uh-uh.
No need.
She's ready for you. Sorceress...
Report.
The source of the light
was a girl of 20 annuals.
A girl? Bring her to me.
Unfortunately,
there were problems.
Last time complications,
this time problems?
She disappeared into the storm
along with her parents.
Your storm?
Are you saying they could be here?
Othersiders in the Outer Zone?
I am sorry, Sorceress.
You did your best.
Zero...
You've just been promoted.
If this girl is in the O.Z.,
find her.
Will Azkadellia attack from the East?
Who?
The sorceress Azkadellia!
The one for whom you spy.
From which direction
will her men come?
Will they walk, or will they fly?
OK, how many times
do I have to tell you guys
that nothing you've said
has made any sense to me?
Perhaps she is just a girl.
Yes, I am. I'm just a girl.
Azkadellia has raided most all villages
searching for the stone.
Are we next on her list?
I don't know about any list,
but if this is how you treat strangers,
I'm not surprised you have enemies.
You know what, can you just
please put my locket down?
It has sentimental value.
Our scouts spotted these two
being pursued by Longcoats
on the old brick route to Central City.
Or leading the Longcoats there.
Somebody saw my parents?
You say parents, I say spies.
There's only one way to know
if she speaks truth or lies.
Strap her to the flayer,
and she talks or dies.
Warm up the blades.
Squeal as you peel,
till the truth brings a deal.
Hey!
You guys are out of your tiny minds!
What are you doing?
Up here?
Little ankle-biters!
Thought it would be funny
to keep me hanging around.
Loosen that rope,
and I might have the last laugh.
Come on, doll.
If Mom and Pop really are
on the route to Central City,
you're falling further and further behind.
You know the way?
Sure.
But it's kind of hard
to give directions like this.
Unless you have a better offer.
Ah. Ooh. Ooh. Oh.
What the hell?
Hey, you aren't so hot
on first glance either, honey.
What, i-is there a problem?
Hm?
Oh, um...
Your, uh...
What?
Your, um...
Your zipper's undone.
Oh... Didn't mean to offend.
Got to be careful
not to lose your marbles.
But, uh, since the sorceress
made her medicos take mine...
Well, you flick the abacus.
Why would they
remove your brain?
Because of what I know,
or used to know,
whatever it was.
Name's Glitch, on account of sometimes
my synapses don't fire right.
Sometimes my synapses
don't fire right.
You just said that.
Did I?
There you go, glitching again.
And here I was, thinking this nightmare
couldn't get any weirder.
This isn't a nightmare.
This is the O.Z.
The Outer Zone.
It used to be a piece of heaven, too.
Until Azka D got her claws into it.
Azkadellia!
Hm.
The Sorceress of Darkness.
Yeah.
Village raider. Brain thief.
Longcoats!
What are you doing?
I have an idea!
Hello? DG?
It's too... It's too high to jump.
I...I really don't think this is a good idea.
Come back! Come back right now.
Ah!
Come on, we don't have much time!
Wait for me.
DG...
Come on!
Quick, before they see us!
Shh!
Hurry! We're safe...
Oh, look, there's a rope!
Are you sure you know
the way to Central City?
The shining city on the hill? Sure.
The shining city
on the hill? Sure.
The shining city on the hill? Sure.
You're gIitching.
Oh.
My noggin wasn't always this way,
you know.
In my heyday,
I was government advisor numero one.
I was the top dog's...
right-hand man.
It would have all been fine,
but her...
But her...?
But her...
I would love a fresh ear of corn
with some butter right now, wouldn't you?
You said you knew the way
to the old brick route.
Well, of course I do. It's only the main
thoroughfare in all of the O.Z.
Why?
Because that's the same stump
that you tripped on hours ago.
We've just gone in a big circle.
A circle.
Not again.
The road is around here somewhere.
I-I-I know it.
Help! Help!
You look familiar. Have we met before?
Shh!
Did you hear that?
Yeah... No.
No, no!
No! No!
No! No, no! No!
Those guys are everywhere.
Yeah, that's life in the O.Z. these days.
Tough and tougher.
No! Not my boy, leave him alone!
No!
Leave him!
No!
No!
Oh...
But even with half a brain,
I can tell that we've got to get out of here.
Oh, cripes.
Stop it! Hey!
DG, this isn't your fight.
Leave them alone!
What just happened?
What is it?
A T.D.E.S.P.H.T.L.
Uh... A Tri-Dimensional Energy-Stored
Projected Holographic Time Loop.
Nifty little thing.
Hey, I think I invented it.
So, it was all fake?
No.
It...it happened, sometime or another.
Why would they have it
playing over and over again
if there was no one here to watch it?
Well, I think it...
There's someone in there.
Or something.
Oh!
Oh!
Are you OK?
Where are they?
I'm going to kill him.
So he just had
to stand there and watch
while his family got tortured
over and over again?
The most imaginative tortures
are saved for those
who resist Azkadellia.
How long were you trapped in there?
Since that was a sapling.
Much obliged for the help.
You're welcome, Mr. Cain.
Um, I'm DG, by the way, and this is...
I know, a headcase.
I have a proper name, you know.
And when I remember it, I will tell you.
What's a headcase?
It's what the state does
to re-educate criminals.
They rip out their brains,
make them prisoners of their own minds.
Ain't that right, convict?
Hey, whoa.
I ain't no convict.
And just in case I am,
it...it was a bogus charge,
a frame-job, I'm sure of it.
Yeah, well...
I'll see you down the road.
Actually, a road is what we're looking for.
We're looking for the Brick route...
Brick route.
..that leads to a place called Central City.
Central City.
Do you know of it?
Yeah.
It's where Zero was headed after...
That's where I'm headed now.
Great! We'll go with you.
I got business.
Besides, I don't travel with kids or convicts.
Um, I'm not a kid, and the people who came
to your home came to mine.
I'm just looking for my parents.
And I'm looking for my brain.
And maybe we can help you find...
Maybe you can what? Find what?
My wife? My boy?
They're gone.
Probably just like your folks are.
Look, nothing personal, kid,
but look at you.
First sign of trouble,
you're just going to cut and run.
Nothing personal, but when we found you,
you were in a tin box.
You don't know me.
Come on, GIitch,
we'll find the way ourselves.
The way?
The way leads through
the fields of the pa-pay.
Pa-pay?
What?
I've been tossed into a storm,
trussed up by lawn gnomes,
chased by madmen on horseback,
how bad can pa-pays be?
I've seen them gnaw people in half
Inside 30 seconds.
Zipperhead, keep your mouth shut.
Kid, you stay behind me.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Believe me,
heart's got nothing to do with it.
Psst!
It came from a young woman.
The othersider.
Do you know who she is?
I will.
Footprints. A few hours old.
One of them's hurt. Right leg's dragging.
That's my dad. One of those guys shot him.
Hey, kiddo.
Little heads-up before you lose yours.
Runners hate water.
Probably why they smell so bad.
So keep your noses peeled.
When it's time to run, you'll know.
My sinuses are flaring.
What's that?
What's what? Ah! Don't touch that!
That's a predigestive enzyme
the pa-pay runners use
to tenderize their meat.
Come on, let's go.
There's someone in there.
An advance hunter party
must have snared it.
We better get out of here
before their friends come back.
We can't just leave him here.
You snatch a dinner from a runner,
be prepared to become its replacement.
Let it be.
Oh, the poor thing
must be scared to death.
All right, come on.
Let's go.
Hey, can I borrow your razor?
You want that bad attitude
dripping out of your ears?
Aaargh!
Run! Go!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Go, DG!
Wrong turn.
Go!
The fall might kill us!
Well, they definitely will!
Whoaaa!
OK, on the count of three. One...
Three!
She searches through the East.
Looking for what?
Love.
For those she loves.
We need to go, DG!
The Longcoats are after you!
DG?
Get a shovel.
You lied to me.
She's alive.
How could you do
such a terrible thing?
Well, it won't work, you know.
She's still a child.
She's here, isn't she? In the O.Z.
Tripping over her pigtails
as she wanders in circles.
Oh, thank the stars.
What else do you have planned? Hmm?
Nothing, I... There is no plan.
My prison is obviously
a little too comfortable for you.
I'll send out my best spies.
No.
I'll send out mine.
Hey, you want to come
closer to the fire? Warm up?
Should have left me to die.
Oh, great, a basket case.
Stay right there.
It's OK. We're all friends here.
You are sad.
Miss your mother
and father.
They miss you.
My name's DG. What's yours?
"Raw."
Well, it's certainly to the point.
You're injured.
He's a viewer.
Viewers are like psychics,
but instead of seeing with their minds,
they see with their hearts.
Azkadellia abducts his kind,
gets her alchemists to suck
the second sight right out of their heads.
He could be a big help.
Look, I don't know
where you came from,
but if you have any interest
in staying alive in the O.Z.
you better get one fact straight
real fast.
Trust no one.
Let's hope those runners
don't have fang pox.
Oh!
Heal wound.
Soothe.
What are you doing?
Hey, wait, wait, wait... Ah!
Brave man.
Good man.
Tin man.
Oh, I might have known
you were a tin man.
What with that attitude.
What's a tin man?
It's what they call policemen
in Central City.
At least I think it is.
You're a cop?
Was. Until Zero found out
I was part of the resistance.
You saw the rest.
Thanks.
I picked up your parents' trail
to the West.
Good work, my Xora.
I knew my oldest friend
would never fail me.
You called for me?
She's near the fields of the pa-pay.
Hey, how about a pit stop, Cain?
No time.
Oh, come on, Tin Man, have a heart.
I'm a thinker, not a hiker.
Yeah, we could all use a rest.
Don't forget, all of life's answers...
Are found along the old road, l remember.
"All of life's answers
are found along the old road."
Did you just say old road?
That's what the locals call
the brick road.
I thought you said
you'd never been here before.
I haven't been here...before...
but I know this place.
The spinner in Milltown
was never as complicated as this.
No matter where we find ourselves,
home is where your heart is.
All my dad's stories...
My parents were from here.
What happened here?
Milltown's been erased.
Azkadellia's term for cleansing history.
Uh-oh. We shouldn't be here.
No humans allowed.
DG!
What?
Oh, hey, guys.
Uh, we were just passing through.
We were just passing through.
We were just passing th...
Who are they?
Stoke the pyre!
Yeah!
Pyre? Can we talk about this?
Azkadellia's invaders
must be made an example of!
What? This is ridiculous.
I don't even know
this Azkadellia person.
You who spoke,
what is your name?
DG.
Your voice patterns are familiar.
I've never been here before.
Hey, don't let him confuse you, baby girl.
Dad!
He's just a crazy old cyborg.
Oh, I was scared I'd never see you again.
Oh! How's your leg?
Everything's OK now you're here.
I can't believe that this is your home.
Not just ours.
You know how you felt like
you never fit in on the other side?
What do you mean?
Well, that voice Father Vue recalled, um...
was your mother's.
It's your voice?
Not mine. Your real mother's.
We are series 1487...
nurture units.
Um, nurture units?
We were programmed
with specific protocoIs
to love and protect you
like you were our own.
OK, that's weird. Um...
You're robots?
Oh, my life is a lie!
It wasn't a lie to us.
We...we feel like your parents, DG.
We love you.
But our deeper purpose
was to tell you the stories of our world,
stories that would
prepare you for your return.
My return?
When you started having the dreams,
we knew it was time for you
to come back to the Zone,
but the Longcoats came
before we could explain.
I'm from here?
Our final task was to bring you
to Father Vue.
He can tell you how to find your real mother.
Milltown was the jewel of the O.Z.
During that time, a beautiful woman
in a dark cloak came to me,
her spirit full of dread.
She'd just lost her husband,
feared losing her child, too.
A girl child she called DG.
That's the woman from my dreams,
the one with the lavender eyes.
That's... that's my mother?
She was so weak and frightened,
I'm not sure how she found
the strength to go on.
So afraid that...she'd be discovered,
that we'd be discovered.
Doing what?
Saving you.
By trusting you to us.
Upon your return, your mother
tasked me to give you something.
She wants it to guide you
on your journey.
Let it connect you to the light,
connect you to her.
Longcoats are coming.
We're running out of time.
Where can I find my mother?
I know not.
But there is a man in the Central City
who has all the answers.
He's smart, magical, powerful.
Some even say he's a wizard.
The Mystic Man.
Yes.
You know him?
I worked his protection detail for a time.
He's a good man. Come on.
But...
Wait! Please come with us.
We can't, honey, our place is here.
You have to go.
We are so proud of you.
I love you both.
I'm sorry, kid, we got to go.
Bye!
Quickly, this way.
How much does she know?
It doesn't have to be like this
for either of you, you know.
I mean, we could all be friends.
How?
Big changes are planned.
You could play an important part
in the future of the O.Z.
Or you could be a verse in a song.
It's your choice.
I wonder why my mother abandoned me.
Maybe not her fault.
She was weak, maybe sick.
Shh! No, I'm sure she's fine.
Probably waiting somewhere for DG
with a warm cup of muglug.
It's a soup.
Something wonderful from my world.
All right, let's pick up the pace.
I want some space between us
and the Longcoats by sundown.
You know, Cain, I understand
why you're afraid of the dark,
what with being locked up
for all those years.
But come on! Relax! It's a beautiful day,
there's a rainbow in the sky,
and we're nearly at the pot of gold.
Wait for me.
We're not in Central City yet.
You know what your problem is, Cain?
You're always fightin' the tide.
Always making yes a no and good a bad.
I've been thinkin'. If Mystic Man
really does have all the answers,
then maybe, after
he's helped DG find her mom,
he could help me refill my noggin.
Give Raw here some spine.
And maybe do something for you
about your lousy attitude!
Well, maybe he can put a zipper
where it'll do some good.
Come on, come on!
There it is!
The shining city on the hill
is starting to tarnish.
This isn't going nearly as well
as I thought it would.
Looking for resistors.
This is a nightmare.
We're going to need some help.
Central City people, gather round!
Antoine Demilo is back in town! Ha-ha!
I don't believe it.
Gratification collected
from near and far
will be available, at reasonable rates,
inside the gate in the Sin District square.
Hey, you, with the stupid hat!
Move it, will ya?
I got commerce to commence here.
Wyatt freakin' Cain.
I thought they were
pissin' on your grave.
I see you're moving up in the world.
How's the sleaze business, Demilo?
Well, since you've been gone,
biz is booming,
so if you don't mind,
I'm working here, a'ight?
Aah!
So am I.
Hey, you're not sportin' tin no more,
So leave go me before
I call the nice Longcoats over there
and request that they bloody
your personage!
Who needs tin when you have
a picture of a certain little man
playing bedsheet bingo
with Zero's first wife?
What? Come on, Cain.
That... Me and Mrs. Z,
w-we was just joking around, that's all.
Oh, really? Why don't I go ask Zero,
see if he thinks it's funny?
Whoa! Please have a heart.
The guy'll flay me like a Munchkin!
He won't have to, if you get us inside,
and tell me where I can find Zero.
What are you gunning for Zero for?
That's a short hop to a deep grave.
You don't know the half of it.
Are you going to help us?
No.
Really?
Yeah.
OK.
OK!
Mm-hm?
Tonight's his weekly shack-up. Aaah!
OK.
Ooh. Ah. Oh...
That was easy, wasn't it?
Oh, God, I hate tin men,
Especially ex-tin men.
Get your mutts in the wagon.
City people, gather round!
Antoine Demilo is back in town! Ha-ha!
Gratification collected from near and far...
Drive through. Through!
Stand aside. Stand aside.
Good driving, Ma.
OK, we're in.
OK, where can we find
the Mystic Man?
Excuse me,
is there a sign on my back,
"Central City
Taxi And Tourist Information?"
Oh! Ow! OK, all right.
All right.
So, the Mystic Man.
That's who you come here for?
Is he still in Central City?
Oh, he's here all right.
He's just not holding court
where he used to.
Ah! Ooh!
These'll get you front row seats.
All right?
You can't go dressed like that, cupcake.
Maybe my girls can find you something.
Then find her something.
Ah!
Now, look. The Mystic Man'll
have all your answers.
You don't need me anymore.
Don't go after Zero.
You're not a killer, you're a tin man.
I told you I'd get you here, and I did.
You take care of yourself, kid.
So these are the precious parents?
Where's your darling girl?
You ran the coercion virus
on their CPUs?
They told us everything,
and don't even remember.
Apparently, the girl went to retrieve
a message held by the Mystic Man.
My gods.
The little bitch
has gone to see the Wizard.
He's the man
The Mystic Man
He'll answer your questions
He always can
His wisdom is known throughout...
I guess old Mystic Man's
a patron of the, uh...
theatrical arts.
..he's got the plan
The Mystic, the Mystic
The Mystic, Mystic Man
The Mystic, the Mystic Man
Silence!
It is time...
for the great and terrible...
Mystic Man.
Question.
Mystic Man, answer me this.
What is the meaning of life?
The answer to that question
is as timeless as the moons.
We must serve
the forces of the universe...
..with all our humanity
and all our humility.
First, we must inhale...
..the magic.
This is the man
with all the answers?
What's wrong with him?
And hold it!
He's out of his mind!
Literally.
Hold it!
And you know the meaning of life!
Inhale the magic?
Azkadellia's vapors.
A magic mist that contains a spell of bliss.
He doesn't know if he's up or down.
I'm sorry, DG.
Hi.
How you doin'?
Wait.
You know what I like...
Well, I know what you like,
so just relax...
and I'll make all your dreams come true.
Where's Zero?
Got to go.
You just missed him.
He busted out of here pronto,
something about some girl
being smuggled into the city.
Cover the back.
Lock this place down.
They don't leave.
Check upstairs.
Seen her?
No?
Hey, there's that guy
who locked up Cain.
We go now.
We've got to get out of here.
No, I'm not leaving
until I get my answers.
Sorry, I don't know.
Have you seen this girl?
I think she's at Demilo's table.
Come in. Come in!
Oh!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hi.
Yes, come in, yes.
Can I, uh... Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, she's down at the end of the hall.
Room number two.
Shh...
Find Zero.
Drop it, or I'll blow you into next week.
I thought you weren't
a tin man anymore.
We got to go.
We can't.
He's not well.
Who's not well?
Oh, my.
That's not the Mystic Man I remember.
Azkadellia's really messed him up.
She's got him on the vapors.
Hey...
Look, until this wears off, you're going
to have to hurt for a while, OK?
I need answers now.
It would be the vapors talking, not him.
Do you think Zero's going to wait?
Sir? Sir, sir...
You have some answers...
Answers?
Yes.
Sure.
Many years ago, you helped a woman
smuggle a child out of the O.Z.
Out of the O.Z. Yes. Yes.
Yes, yes.
Out of the O.Z. Yes!
Yes. I was that child.
Right.
So you have to help me find out
where my mother is,
who my mother is.
Um...
A woman, uh, um...
Women are great.
No, uh... I remember, um...
I remember who...who, um... Who...
My mother.
Who?
Who?
My mother.
Whose mother?
My mother.
Whose mother? Oh!
Oh! I'm sorry.
You have the most brilliant
beautiful blue eyes.
But your mother...
Your mother had lavender.
You do remember.
OK, kiddo, we got
to get out of here right now.
Not now, Mr. Cain. He hasn't told us
where to find my mother.
Cain?
Cain, you were one of mine,
weren't you?
A tin man.
A long time ago.
I'll talk to you later.
Psst! Psst!
Please...
The Northern Island.
The Northern Island.
Your journey for her,
to find who you are, starts there.
Let this guide you.
OK.
All right, you two, get those two out of here.
Let's go, let's go.
No, no, no.
Let's go. Go!
No, you stay with her at all costs.
I have to take care of Zero.
You know who she is now.
She's the key.
Promise me.
I want your word as a tin man...
you will not leave her side
at any cost.
You have my word.
Wakey wakey, sunshine.
Go away, we're closed.
Ow! I said back off, moron.
Class act, Demilo.
Cain, what do you want?
Thanks for the ride.
Whoa! How can you do this to me?
I have a wife and children.
This is my wagon!
How do you start this thing?
Oh, you gotta pull the knob out,
and then twist the red thing.
Thank you.
This is my wagon!
Cain!
Cain, I'm talking to you! Cain, I...
Hey! That's my wagon!
How is it that a young, unarmed girl
in a party dress
eludes the toughest division in my army?
She wasn't alone.
She was helped by...
Wyatt Cain, one of the Mystic Man's tin men.
Bring him in.
If it isn't the great and terrible
blah, blah, blah himself.
What are you up to, old man?
Huh?
A little scent.
A little whiff.
Oh, you don't fool me.
Please?
Please. Please.
Why did she come to see you? Hm?
What did you give her?
Hook him up.
What was that?
I don't know.
You all right?
Yeah, just freezing.
You stay here.
Bah!
Oh, what now?
Broke axle.
No kidding.
Come on, let's go. We're walking.
What we're looking for is over there!
Ice mountain?
That's the Northern Island?
Well, I know it's
around here somewhere.
"Frozen in time in a sea of ice,"
just like my dad said it would be.
What?
Come on, let's go.
The microcosm is expanded
by a single bead of sweat
dropped on a pinhead
and spun into a million universes,
until it is converted
into the elixir of the gods...
He's masking.
Then...
LyIo see too much!
..and only then, can longing,
great and passionate longing
reach fulfillment.
Lylo see too much!
My fingers, extended to the stars...
Focus, Lylo, don't let him sway you.
..seen and unseen in the darkness,
becomes merely a flicker
in the light of the storm,
a glimpse of heaven,
fierce and beautiful and unfiltered...
Pain...
Where is she?
So much pain.
Move beyond the pain.
The Northern Island.
She's going to see Mummy.
Dig!
Dig?
What do you mean, dig?
Wait, wait.
"The daughter of light came upon
a glistening white mountain,
"frozen in time in a sea of ice.
"Above all else she knew that...
"that this mountain
was more than it appeared.
"It was home."
Is it locked?
My mother was the queen?
That makes you princess.
You knew my mother.
I knew I wasn't an idiot.
Or a convict.
I was the queen's advisor.
"The queen sat...
"gazing hopefully out
upon her frozen realm...
"longing for her daughter to return."
DG, wait.
Sad...
Mother waited.
Couldn't stay.
There is something
so familiar about this.
No.
Bad things...
Bad things happened here.
What bad things?
We go. We go now.
No. No, I need to know.
Raw, please.
Bad things...
Tell her.
Look.
Two little princesses
dancing in a row
Spinning fast and freely
on their little toes
Where the light will take you
there's only one way to know
Two little princesses
dancing in a row
My angel, my light. Sleep well.
Wait, that's you.
I knew you, too.
Oh, I wish I could remember.
"The majestic queen of the O.Z.
"Had two lovely daughters, she..."
That's Azkadellia.
Marbles or not,
evil like that you don't forget.
Azkadellia's my sister.
"One to darkness she be drawn
"And one to light she be shown
"Double eclipse it is foreseen
"Light meets dark
in the stillness between
"But only one and one alone
"Shall hold the emerald
and take the throne"
Only one,
and one alone.
She tried to kill me.
No. She did kill you.
But that can't be.
I'm so sorry I didn't protect you!
I never thought...
Oh, my angel.
Fear not, my child,
there is one thing that can stop her.
The emerald of the eclipse.
The secret to finding it
now lives inside of you.
When the time is right,
you will return.
Mother never could
leave well enough alone.
Azkadellia.
You're my sister.
DG...the little sister
I thought I no longer had.
I've always wondered
what you'd look like.
Leave her alone.
What do you want?
Well, up until a moment ago,
I wanted your death.
Hm! But now it seems
you have something I need.
What?
The emerald. You know where it is.
Don't tell me you
haven't dreamed of it,
heard it calling to you, begging to be found
from its dark hiding place.
No, I haven't.
No?
No.
What did she whisper in your ear?
I don't remember.
That's a shame.
How can I tell you what I don't know?
DG, where are you?
Mother?
DG, where are you?
What have you done with her?
Put her away for safe-keeping.
Like any good daughter would.
Where?
Somewhere you will never find her.
Go! Go!
Wait!
Bring her to me.
Now I know why they call you Zero.
Still can't fight your own battles.
I do my share.
DG!
Bring him.
Put me down!
No iron suit for you this time.
No wife and child
crying for years
to free you from it.
My family's alive?
Hardly matters now.
Glitch!
Ah!
Welcome back, little sister.
There's no place like the O.Z.
