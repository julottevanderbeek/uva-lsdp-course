-
Hup, you jugheads... Hup!
Hold that fire
till you can make it count.
Hup! Hup!
Your hides or my hair!
- You all right, darling?
- Yes, Father.
They ain't fallin' off
for nothin'.
Doggone.
There they go.
I didn't even get
a shot at 'em.
Good morning, folks.
Good...
Are you all right, ma'am?
Yes, l... I guess so.
I knowed it was you.
Ain't another rifle in the world with
a bark like that Springfield of yours.
Oh, Miss Frederici, I want you to meet up
with Buffalo Bill Cody...
How do you do?
And thank you very much.
- Mr. Cody.
- I guess I'd better go catch them mules.
- I'll help the sergeant.
- My daughter and I are grateful, sir.
- You've saved our lives.
- Anyone would figure himself lucky for the chance.
But not everyone
would have acted so courageously.
She's right, Mr. Cody.
We need more men like you
to exterminate these savages.
They must be wiped out,
root and branch.
There's some white men
that need wiping out.
I don't understand you, sir.
This is not a war arrow.
It's a hunting arrow. There are no barbs.
Are you implying
that we were fair game?
No, I mean that those were agency Indians,
drunk on white man's whiskey.
I suppose that
excuses them out here.
Well, the red man
and whiskey don't mix.
Senator, you and Mr. Carvel
can double up on Fanny...
and, Miss Frederici,
you take Hyacinth.
If she cause you any trouble, you
cuss her out and kick her in the slats.
I'll climb up here with Bill.
l... I'm afraid I'm not exactly dressed
for kickin' and cussin'.
Perhaps it would be better
if I went with Mr. Cody.
Uh, I guess you're right, miss.
Prepare to mount.
Mount!
This is very kind of you, Mr. Cody.
I hope it's not too much for your horse.
Oh, no.
You're light to carry.
We went down to Arizona
For to fight
the Injuns there
Oh, the drums they rolled
upon my soul
And this is the way
they go
Forty miles a day
on beans and hay
- Hiya, Chips.
- I've been waiting for you.
Somebody wrote you a letter.
- Who, me?
That's right, my boy. Who in the world
would be writing to you?
I don't know, but if you give me
the letter, I'll find out.
You'll get yours
in your proper turn.
The mail's delivered
according to rank...
and there's plenty
ranker than you.
Do I have to wait
for every noncom in the outfit?
You'll wait for every noncom
and every buck trooper too.
A civilian don't rate.
Hi, Bill.
Hello, Eda.
Now, you run on home
to your mama.
Bye-bye, Bill.
Welcome, Mr. Cody.
- Welcome.
- Won't you come in?
We have a number
of unexpected guests you must meet.
Maybe I better not stay,
Miss Frederici.
- I'm not dressed for this sort of a soiree.
- Oh, nonsense.
In these buckskins,
you're the handsomest man in the room.
By the Lord Harry,
it's Nimrod the hunter...
led captive by Aphrodite.
Gentlemen, Mr. Cody.
General Blazier,
Mr. Vandervere...
and Mr. Ned Buntline.
Mr. Cody, sir, we've heard
of your indomitable heroism...
in snatching Miss Frederici from death
at the hand of the bloodthirsty savage.
- Will you honor me by taking wine?
- Thank you,
- Buntline.
- Buntline?
Buntline, sir. Special correspondent
of the
I'm a man of pronounced
temperance principles, Mr. Cody.
Founder of the National Association
of Modern Abstainers.
But there are moments when principle
must yield to the importance of occasion.
To your good health, sir.
How are you enjoying your trip,
Mr. Buntline?
You've seen a great deal of the world.
What do you think of the West?
The most amazing source of inspiration
I've ever encountered.
The wilderness, the torrent, the peak,
the unending solitudes...
where roams the Indian
in all his ferocity, in all his nobility.
After seeing his ferocity,
I'm a little skeptical about his nobility.
Indians are good people,
if you leave 'em alone.
Nothing would suit me better
than to leave them alone, all alone.
The last to arrive
on the glorious battlefield of Shiloh...
- and the first to leave it!
-
- You'll never live that one down, General.
I made this myself,
Mr. Cody.
I hope you'll enjoy it.
It's a trifle.
Trifle?
Oh, how stupid of me,
Mr. Cody.
Do you mind?
- Thank you, Mr. Cody.
- Thank you.
Well, gentlemen,
I leave you to your port and politics.
Who are you?
What do you mean by breaking
into my room and stealing my clothes?
I didn't come here to steal.
Maybe you Indians have another word for it,
but that's my dress you have on.
I tell you,
I didn't come here to steal.
Perhaps you'll explain to me
just what you're doing in my clothes.
- I wanted to find out something.
- Just what, may I ask?
I wanted to find out if... if I could be
as beautiful as a white girl...
in a white girl's way.
Oh.
I see.
There's your answer.
You look beautiful.
I wish your Indian brave
could see you now.
Indian!
Please, l... I'd rather you kept it.
It was becoming to you.
I don't believe you. You don't want it
because an Indian wore it!
Indian!
- Senator, have I made myself clear?
- Perfectly.
You may count on my support
when the issue comes before Congress.
Mr. Vandervere, why can't you build your
railroad around the Cheyenne lands...
instead of across them?
Young man, that would delay
construction for over a year...
and double the cost.
- Yes, Sergeant?
- We found him, sir.
- We had a little trouble.
- Bring him in.
A distinguished visitor, gentlemen.
Yellow Hand.
Son of ChiefTall Bull.
Excellent.
Let's have a look at him.
Do you think that we can get him
to listen to reason?
I doubt it. I've gotten nothing
out of any of them.
- How, Yellow Hand.
- How,
Tell him his people must move out of
the Smoky Hill country within 30 days.
I understand your words.
I've been to white man's school.
We've hunted and fished together
since we were so high.
Once you saved
Yellow Hand's life.
When you do an Indian a favor,
he never forgets it.
If you do him bad,
he never forgets that either.
Very interesting.
Now, tell us, Yellow Hand...
They give themselves
amazing names.
Tell us why your people
refuse to obey the order to move.
We must live where
there is food and water and buffalo.
What has the buffalo
got to do with it?
Without the buffalo, the Indian
would practically perish.
It's his main source of food. In the winter,
the hides protect them from freezing.
I see.
If you want something
from the Indians...
why don't you treat their chiefs the way
you would the heads of any other nations?
What do you mean?
Yellow Hand is a prince,
the son of a king.
Invite men like that to Washington.
Understand them, what they're up against.
Maybe they'll be able
to understand you.
Savages loose in the East?
The idea is preposterous.
But what a headline!
"Redskin powwow at the Hotel Astor."
If they won't talk sense
here in their own backyard...
what can you expect
Yellow Hand,
do you want us to use force?
My people do not want war...
but we will fight
if we must.
General, are you prepared to act?
- Yes. I have my orders.
- All right, Yellow Hand.
You've had your last warning.
Move...
or be driven out.
Is the white man finished?
How.
How.
Well, as a newspaperman...
I have covered every kind of fight, riot
and revolution, but never an Indian war.
Here's to something new.
You wouldn't talk like that,
Mr. Buntline...
if you ever saw the Cheyenne
on the warpath.
There's nothing to be alarmed at.
I'll clean them out in a week.
General, there's a Cheyenne war party,
about 500 braves, heading this way.
- Where'd you make contact?
- Twenty miles from here,
on the left bank of the Smoky.
Trumpeter, sound to arms!
Come inside.
Go swiftly
to my brother Yellow Hand.
Tell him there's an old man
here at the agency...
a medicine man
great in the council of the whites.
You understand,
Crow Feather?
Tell my brother that if this man
is taken hostage...
it will make it easier for the Cheyenne
to make a good peace.
Hmm.
Three days' rations and forage,
- The column will move in 30 minutes.
- Very good, sir.
- You don't mean you're going
to meet them out in the open?
- Certainly I am.
Doesn't sound like a very good idea
to me. Cheyenne are a shifty lot.
I'll attend to the strategy, Cody.
My strategy is the attack,
now and any other time.
It's ignominious!
A miserable mule casts a shoe, and I, who
have been in the very forefront of battle...
miss a chance
to ride in Blazier's column.
Maybe you're not missing anything
by being left behind.
Hmm, I guess not. Don't you think
the Cheyenne will give Brazier a battle?
If they do, it won't be
where he's looking for it.
You know the Indian,
Cody, don't you?
Nobody knows the Indian.
I've had to fight 'em since I was 14.
Pony Express,
stage driving, scouting.
- Indians never do what you expect.
- What's that?
- The Indians.
- Blazier's not between them
and the settlement anymore.
- Where are you going?
To the agency.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Those horrible savages took my father.
They'll torture him to death,
those noble friends of yours.
- Well, do something!
Why don't you go after them?
- Nothing we can do now.
- How many were there?
- Don't know. It was a war party.
They swarmed all over us.
I can't track them in the dark.
Even if I could, there are too many of them.
- But we must do something.
- All we can do is hope for the best.
If they didn't kill all three of you outright,
it means they wanted the senator as a hostage.
By the Lord Harry,
that's it!
To get better peace terms.
Savages, brutes, fiends!
Why did I ever come to
this nightmare of a country?
How.
-
-
Yellow Hand.
Your squaws
can't make me run.
Get down from your horse
and see if you can.
-
- Let them alone.
They've got more grit
than your braves.
I came in peace because
I thought the Cheyenne were men.
- They're squaws.
- Such words have no place
between warriors, long hair.
Thanks, Yellow Hand.
It's more comfortable.
It is the word of my father...
the Cheyenne will make peace...
if the land between
the two rivers is left to us.
If the white man will hear
the word of my father...
let them come to powwow
at Council Grove.
If they will not hear his word,
let them come armed for war.
My father has spoken.
- I will carry his word.
- Then go,
I'm not going without the white man
you took from the agency.
The white man is a hostage.
My father says his price
will be told at the powwow.
Tell your father his price was paid
when I saved your life.
A debt is a debt,
Yellow Hand.
A debt is a debt.
The white man
will return with you.
Thanks, Yellow Hand.
You've acted like a friend.
Now there is no debt...
and no friendship between us.
If we meet in battle,
there's a brave of the Cheyenne...
who will take the scalp of
and hang it to his lodgepole.
It may be easier to hang it
than to take it, Yellow Hand.
Mr. Carvel! Mr. Carvel!
Buffalo Bill is here!
Father!
You better get the senator to bed.
He's worn out.
- We'll help him.
- Take my arm, Senator.
Thank you.
I wish there was some way
of saying what I feel...
or some way of repaying you
for what you've done.
Maybe there is,
Miss Louisa.
Me and Powderface would like to show you
some of our country before you go away.
I would love you to.
We'd like you to know
what there is about it...
that gets under a man's skin.
I'd like to.
"Representative of the United States of America
and of the Cheyenne nation...
signed below as a solemn pledge
of faith and agreement."
- Do you agree?
-
I sign.
I hate to see you go, Ned.
Now that the fighting's over,
what'll you be writing about next?
I was thinking of turning my pen
to the realm of romance.
A novel about the West
founded on my own adventures.
I'd sure like to read that.
You know, Bill, I was even considering
including some of your exploits.
But no, you'd never do
for a hero of romantic fiction.
Guess you're right
about that.
but you don't marry her.
But I'm going to.
What?
- You mean Miss Louisa?
- I sure do.
- You've asked her?
- Well, no, not yet.
Oh.
- Come in.
Oh, Mr. Buntline.
Are you ready, Bill?
Just about,
I should say, ma'am.
- You're fond of me, Powderface, aren't you?
- Any horse would be, ma'am.
You're light to carry
and you sit quiet.
That's what you said the first time we met.
You're repeating yourself.
Powderface is a horse
of sound judgment, ma'am.
His sentiment's
all right with me.
Anybody he's fond of,
I'm fond of.
That's a lovely blanket, Bill.
Yeah, that's a Cheyenne
courting blanket.
A courting blanket?
Yeah. A Cheyenne girl wears that,
it means she's out for some brave.
How does she wear it?
Like this.
Oh.
This way, Bill?
No, the left side...
Over the heart first.
Like this?
Then what does
the brave do?
Well, he... he doesn't even
open his mouth.
He just hangs around
all day...
and makes faces like this.
That sounds like
a very dull courtship.
If he doesn't speak,
how does he propose?
Well, he, uh... he plays his own call
on a courting flute.
Like this.
What does the girl do
if she wants to accept him?
Well, she opens the left side
of the blanket and takes him into it.
- Like this, Bill?
-
Hi, folks!
- Hey, Chips!
- Whoa! Hey! Ho!
Look what I fetched you,
Mrs. Cody!
- Father!
- Louisa!
- Why didn't you let us know you were coming?
- Didn't you get my letter?
- No.
Why, that's it. That's my letter
telling you I was coming.
- I mailed it a week before I left.
- That's nothin'.
Private Mulligan didn't get the letter with
his reprieve till 10 days after they hung him.
Come to think about it,
he never did get it.
- Hey, Bill, would you get the senator's bags?
- All right.
Come on, boy.
It doesn't look as if you young people have
been living in luxury for the past two years.
- That's being changed though, right away.
- What do you mean?
Vandervere's starting a new industry here,
a tremendous affair.
- An industry here?
- Yes, my boy.
A craze for buffalo robes
has swept the East.
People will pay anything for them.
Vandervere's formed a corporation.
I'm on the board myself.
And you, Bill, are going to
direct the field operations.
- Field operations?
- Yes.
Hire every hunting outfit available.
We want all the hides
you can get and more.
- How,
- How yourself.
- Sit down, Ned.
- No, thank you.
A slight saddle concussion
makes standing more agreeable.
How does the grand duke
like buffalo hunting?
Thinks it's the greatest sport he's ever
seen. Nothing like it in Russia.
He wants you to come over and join him
in postprandial potations.
What's that?
Firewater.
Afraid he'll have to excuse me tonight.
I'm tired.
Ned, I've been looking at these papers
you sent over. They've got me worried.
How so, my doting Nimrod?
Bill's been wondering about the large scale
this buffalo hunting has been assuming.
It seems to be
going on everywhere.
This started out as a business. Now they're
shooting 'em out of train windows for sport.
- There's a limit to even the buffalo.
- Limit? Oh, yes, my boy.
I suppose there is a limit
to the sands of the seashore...
but who's going to count them?
Hmm. Maybe you're right, Ned,
but it worries me.
What worries me is
whether the grand duke...
is overstepping
the bounds of moderation.
- I'll carry your apologies.
Good night, Mrs. Cody.
Good night.
Bill, why didn't you join
the grand duke?
It's not very often you're going to get
a chance to hobnob with royalty.
I like my present company
better.
I was afraid when I brought you here,
but now I'm glad.
You've been happy.
Bill, at this moment...
I'm happier than
I've ever been before.
I'm happy too.
And tired.
Nothing in the world
could move me right now.
- I wonder.
- No, sirree.
Not even the grand duke himself
could budge me tonight.
Suppose it was someone much more
important than the grand duke.
Who could that be?
No!
Yes. Oh, Bill,
what are you doing?
- What are you doing, Bill?
- You lie perfectly still, darling. I'll pack up.
- Pack up?
- Yes, I've got to get you
to the doctor at the fort.
Oh, Bill, not yet.
Men of the nations...
there's a black cloud
coming from the east...
to cover us all.
We, the Cheyenne,
have called our brothers of the Sioux...
so we can hear their words
about this thing.
Today...
the buffalo is few...
as the leaves of the oak tree
in winter.
The white man
has done this thing...
so the red man will starve.
When the buffalo is gone,
we starve.
We have no meat to eat...
Brothers, it's not good
for man to hear...
his woman and children crying.
It's a bad thing
for a man to starve.
There are better ways to die.
The word of the Cheyenne
is the word of the Sioux.
Let both people be bound
by the belts of the war chiefs.
It is the belt of Yellow Hand,
war chief of the Cheyenne.
It is the belt of Crazy Horse,
war chief of the Sioux.
The Sioux and the Cheyenne
will strike together.
The Sioux must strike first.
But why the Sioux?
The Cheyenne are ready.
In the land of the Cheyenne
are many white soldiers.
In our land are few.
My brother is wise in war.
l... I'm called away.
I must go back
to my people.
Go to your homes.
There will be
no more school.
Do as I say.
Go to your homes.
Leave!
Do you have to drive
so slowly, Bill?
I'm not taking any chances.
I'll get you to the doctor.
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
- Tobacco, Grandmother?
- What's she doing here all alone?
- She's just old.
When Indians get too old to travel,
they're left behind...
with a little food and fuel.
- To die?
- Yeah.
That's terrible.
Can't we do something for her?
It's the way of her people.
There's nothing we can do.
Here am I, going to bring
a new life into the world...
and leaving an old woman
behind to die.
That's nature's way, Louisa.
When anything becomes too old
to be useful, it's just pushed aside.
But it shouldn't be.
That's why we have civilization.
Yah!
Oh!
Bill!
Whoa.
Yeehaw!
Louisa. Darling.
Bill.
Is it a boy?
- It's a boy.
- Is he perfect?
- Listen to him.
Give him to me.
You all right?
I'm gonna name him after
the greatest scout that ever lived...
Kit Carson.
It's a lovely name.
Bill, couldn't we
take him east?
East? What would we
be doing in the East?
I want him to be safe...
to have care, doctors, schools...
all the advantages of civilization.
Well, he'll have care,
and he won't need any doctor.
He got here without one.
Schools...
We'll think of that
when the time comes.
It would be nice
to go east though.
But it doesn't matter
where we are, Bill...
as long as we're together...
the three of us.
Platoon, count fours!
- Count fours!
- Cody.
Cody, this is providential.
I need you.
- We're moving out.
- Moving? Where?
Man, haven't you heard?
The Sioux have overrun the north,
beaten Crook and wiped out Custer.
- Wiped out Custer?
- And the Seventh Cavalry. Every last man.
We're joining Crook
on the North Platte.
- Well, Cody?
You see how it is, General.
Yes. But you know what
this disaster means.
We move in two minutes,
Cody...
with or without you.
- Bill, you can't go.
- I don't want to go.
- But you're going.
Bill, you can't leave us.
Nothing matters so long
as we're together, the three of us.
Bill, I loved you. I could endure anything
as long as you were with me.
You wanted a son,
and I bore him for you, like a squaw.
But he's mine
as much as yours.
If you leave now,
it's... it's forever.
I'll take him
back East with me...
to civilization, to safety.
I think we're making
a big mistake, General.
Our main problem is to keep the Cheyenne
from joining forces with the Sioux.
You're way off, Cody.
The Cheyenne haven't risen.
They will.
They're blood brothers with the Sioux.
Our best move is to keep 'em bottled up in their
own country by taking War Bonnet Gorge.
- That's miles off our path.
- Whoever holds the gorge holds the whip hand.
But it's completely
out of our terrain.
We won't have any terrain
if the Cheyenne join the Sioux.
Orders are orders, Cody.
Yours are to guide us to the North Platte
by the quickest way.
All right, sir.
By the quickest way.
Hey, Chips!
- We're changing direction here.
- I thought the North Platte would be that way.
This is a short cut. The old man
wants to go by the quickest way.
Trooper Smith, fall out and tell "A" Troop
to change their direction.
Clancy, wake up! You fall asleep again,
I'll trample the stripes out of you!
Holy smokes, Bill Cody!
Them's Cheyenne.
Where are we?
War Bonnet Gorge. We've got to hold it
till the column gets here.
Clancy, here's that dollar
I owe you.
Come on, boys!
Where's old Blazier anyway?
I never thought I'd live to see the day when
I'd be praying for the sight of his ugly mug.
Save your breath
and keep firing.
The old man won't save
any breath on you...
when he finds out
what you got us into.
- Sounds like the point's engaged, General.
- Sound the gallop!
Cody, is this War Bonnet Gorge?
That's what they call it.
I guess I lost my way.
Lost your way?
Nothing of the sort.
Deliberate disobedience
of orders.
I'll have you shot... hung for this.
Shooting's too good for you.
There they are,
forming to charge.
If 16 men can't hold them till the troops
get here, we're scuppered, thanks to you.
What's that madman doing,
making medicine?
Wait. That's Yellow Hand.
Don't shoot!
You fool, what do you think
you're going to do?
Save you five minutes
so the troops can get here.
Though I am dead,
the grass will grow...
the sun will shine,
the stream will flow.
Though I am dead,
the grass will grow...
the sun will shine,
the stream will flow.
Yellow Hand!
Turn back, Yellow Hand!
Take your people back to their own country.
The Cheyenne have no part
in this war.
The Cheyenne have part
in this war.
The white men have fallen
before the Sioux.
Now they will fall
before the Cheyenne!
There is no need for war.
Let us speak fair words in council.
There are no fair words
in the mouth of a white man.
This time it is the lances
of the Cheyenne that will speak!
- And now!
You said a brave of the Cheyenne
would hang my scalp on his lodgepole!
Where is he?
In the lodges of your women?
Ah,
Here he is!
-
-
A friend of yours, Bill?
They were all friends of mine.
-  Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Hiya, Chips.
Anything for me?
If there is, you'll get it
in the order of your rank...
and I'm thinkin'
it won't be soon...
what with six months' mail
to be sorted.
Supposin' I find it myself?
If you find it,
you can keep it.
But you'll get
no delivery from me...
except in the proper
military manner.
- And you know what that means.
- Yeah.
Went out into Wyomin'
for to fight the Injuns there
- Here's one.
- Yeah?
It from your wife?
No.
It's from the president
of the United States.
- He wants me to come east.
- I told you, Bill Cody, you'd get in trouble...
for leadin' them troops
the wrong way.
- Is it to get a court-martial?
- No.
- It's to get a medal.
- A medal, you say?
Yeah, for the battle
at War Bonnet Gorge.
Hey, I was in that too.
Maybe there'll be one for me.
Here it is.
It's the same envelope.
"Private Chips McGraw, Fifth U.S. Cavalry,
Department of Missouri."
Say, what's the matter with the president
addressin' me as Private Chips McGraw?
Oh, of course, the man's
only been on the job a short time.
"In conformance with
Army Regulations 248... and a half...
"Private Chips McGraw,
having completed 20 years' enlistment...
"is hereby retired from active service
in the U.S. Army...
"by order of the secretary,
Philip Sheridan...
Second Lieutenant
and Adjutant."
The president's loco calling me a private
and Phil Sheridan a shavetail.
How'd the man get his job?
What's the date on that letter?
- "April 3, 1846."
- Oh, that's 30 years ago!
Well, here's some more.
"First endorsement.
"The above order having
been temporarily misfiled...
"and in view of possible
inconvenience incurred...
"by the delay
in its transmission...
"Private McGraw is authorized to proceed
for permanent residence...
"to the Old Soldiers' Home
in Skittleboro, New York.
Signed, Philip Sheridan,
Lieutenant General Commander, U.S.A."
- Me that's been praying for a letter for 50 years...
this is what I get.
Tough luck, Chips.
We'll go east together anyhow.
In the prime of my life...
me that's just whipped
the Cheyenne...
and could do it again
with one hand...
going to
the Old Soldiers' Home.
- I got more lead in my carcass...
"Retreat," is it?
Retreat to the Old Soldiers' Home.
Chips!
A proud man you ought to be,
Bill Cody, goin' to see the president.
Yeah. I wanna see my boy too.
Yeah. Who's to blame you
for that?
One of these days, he might be president...
or even an officer.
He was only three days old when I left.
I wonder if he'll remember me.
Were his eyes open yet?
Yeah. They were blue.
Then he'll know you all right.
I hope Ned Buntline
meets me in Washington.
It's kinda lonesome
in a strange country.
Nobody in the East
ever heard my name.
- Hey, Bill, let's go get me some tobacco.
- All right, Chips.
Hey, Bill!
Bill, come here.
They're about you, Bill.
Ned Buntline's put you in the books.
- Sure. That's your picture there.
- Right out in front.
- Anything I can do for you gentlemen?
Holy mackerel!
It is!
Hey, Joe! Mary!
Lizzie!
- Come on, Chips.
Hey, folks! Hey, folks!
Here's Buffalo Bill!
I thought nobody in the East
ever heard your name.
I sure hated to say good-bye
to poor old Chips.
I'll have him back with me
if I'm ever fixed to do it.
- Come in.
l... l...
I've got the horse stabled
all right, sir.
He's well taken care of.
The White House carriage is out in front.
Good, my wing-footed Hermes.
Here's a dollar.
If it's the same to you,
I'd...
I'd rather shake hands
with Mr. Buffalo Bill.
That's the first time any handshake
of mine was ever worth a dollar.
- Thank you, sonny.
- Thank you, sir.
-
- Let's get this foofaraw over with.
- I wanna see  son.
- You'll see him...
just as soon as the president has decorated
you with the Congressional Medal.
Let the new prince of the plains
cut his teeth on it.
What's all that stuff
you're reading?
Requests for interviews,
invitations.
The whole East is clamoring
to see the hero of War Bonnet Gorge.
Our old friend, Vandervere,
is arranging a banquet for you in New York.
Yes, sir. It's a big...
Here! But the president...
- Where's my son?
- He's upstairs, sir.
No!
- What killed my son?
-  Bill.
Diphtheria.
- What's that?
- It's a germ.
Where does it come from?
From water systems,
from sewage.
It's a crowd disease...
a disease of civilization.
Civilization.
The West wasn't
good enough for him.
If you'd left him where he belonged,
he'd be alive today.
Oh, Bill!
The president knows why
you didn't show up, Bill.
His deepest personal sympathy
goes with that medal.
So that's what they give you
for killing Indians...
Indians that can
live against nature...
and feed and clothe themselves
with nothing but their bare hands.
Don't you think
we ought to leave?
And who gives it to you?
They're pot-bellied, civilized citizens
who couldn't walk a mile with an Indian.
give you medals.
- Try to control yourself. People are listening.
Let 'em listen!
Anybody who could hold his own against Indians
doesn't have to shut up for these people.
Any 10-year-old kid
who was born and raised like an Indian...
could whip the daylights
outta them.
Any kid.
Any kid.
Come on, partner.
Civilization, Mr. President,
creates its own forces.
And if I have been
one of them...
I have no apologies to offer
and no regrets.
My ambition to see civilization
move westward on tracks of steel...
has been severely criticized
by certain elements of the press...
and even
on the floor of Congress.
On the other hand,
there are those...
better qualified
to express an opinion...
who believe,
like General Sherman...
that the only good Indian
is a dead Indian.
We have here tonight
a guest...
who knows more about the frontier
than any man living...
and who, if we hold
with General Sherman...
has made more good Indians
than any other man in the West.
Mr. President...
ladies and gentlemen,
Buffalo Bill.
Read it slowly.
Don't get nervous.
Mr. President...
ladies and gentlemen.
I was afraid I was gonna make a fool
of myself in front of you tonight...
but that would have
been all right.
Because a man can make a fool of himself
when he's off his own stamping ground.
But when a man makes a fool of himself
his own stamping ground...
there's no excuse for him.
I don't hold
with General Sherman...
that a good Indian
is a dead Indian.
From what I've seen,
the Indian is a free-born American...
who'll fight for his folks,
for his land and for his living...
just like
any other American.
- HolyJupiter! This is dynamite.
If you knew the Indians...
if you could see them
for yourselves...
how they live against nature
with nothing but their bare hands...
you'd never force them
to break treaties to keep from starving.
But the trouble is you Easterners
don't know what you're doing...
and that's why we Westerners
and the Indians have had to suffer.
There's only one Indian you know
or that you ever thought about.
And here he is,
Mr. Vandervere.
Man, do you realize
what you're up against?
Do you think Vandervere's gonna let
a hayseed like you ride out of the West...
and get away with a thing like this?
You're crazy.
- I tell you there's nothing Vandervere won't do.
- What can he do to me?
- I don't know, but it'll be plenty.
- Uh-huh.
Look, Bill, I like you.
I built you up, and I don't want
to see him tear you down.
I'll take care of myself.
All right.
If you insist on being a martyr,
good luck to you, Bill.
I'm off to Mexico.
But I'm warning you...
Vandervere will stop at nothing.
Buffalo Bill is all right...
a good hunter, a good Indian scout.
But to give him all the credit
for our victory at War Bonnet Gorge...
well, that's going
a little too far.
- I tell ya, Buffalo Bill's a fraud.
I was at War Bonnet Gorge
myself.
He didn't have any more to do
with killin' Yellow Hand than I did.
She escaped from the harem of the sultan
at the risk of her life.
What's the matter? Ain't you got
no sportin' blood in you?
Maybe.
Haven't you?
Sure.
I haven't got a dime,
but I'll gamble this against your dollar.
What's that?
Judas!
Hey, Muldoon!
Come here.
Will you look what this hobo
wants to sell for a dime?
Holy Saint Patrick.
The Congressional Medal.
- Where did the likes of you get this?
- A place called War Bonnet Gorge.
War Bonnet Gorge.
Well, well. Think of that now.
Well, I'm takin' you to a place
called the station house.
What for? It's my medal.
I'm Buffalo Bill Cody.
And I'm Jenny Lind.
Will you take a walk with me, or must I
sing you a lullaby with me nightstick?
I  Buffalo Bill Cody.
You know, if I was pretendin' to be someone,
I wouldn't be  faker.
-
-
-
- Set 'em up again.
- That's some shootin', mister!
I wouldn't have missed it
for a dollar.
- Whoo!
Pleased to meet ya,
Mr. Cody.
'Tis the king of Siam you are
if you're sayin' so.
I guess the laugh's on me, Mr. Buffalo.
Here's your medal.
Oh, thanks.
How about the dollar?
- I'd like to eat.
- On the level?
Yeah.
Say, maybe you and me
can do a little business.
Louisa, you can't go on
torturing yourself like this.
He's gone.
Make a new life for yourself.
- Divorce him.
- No.
I can't stand
seeing you suffer, my dear.
Why don't you go to him?
That's really what
you'd like to do.
Forget your pride.
He's worth it.
I wish I'd had the courage to stand up
to Vandervere...
when I'd found
I'd been deceived.
Do you know
where he is now?
No.
How he's earning
his living?
No.
He's posing at the Wonderland Museum
in New York...
on a wooden horse.
No!
- Step up, ladies and gentlemen!
Step up for a moral and educational
exhibition of marksmanship...
by the King of the Plains...
killer of Cheyenne war chief,
that human tiger, Yellow Hand...
-
- and hero... hero of War Bonnet Gorge.
Introducing Buffalo Bill!
-
Aw, he never saw
an Indian in his life!
Just a minute! Just a minute!
Please! Please!
The management is aware of a difference
of opinion as to Mr. Cody's exploits.
Be that as it may,
ladies and gentlemen...
in order to prove that
he is well-able to do...
It will give the sum
of $1,000 in gold...
should Mr. Cody fail
to shoot a silver dollar...
from between the fingers
of any man, woman or child...
who will volunteer
to hold the same.
- Why don't you hold it yourself, mister?
-
Because it is an unfortunate
weakness of human nature...
to distrust a man
of my profession.
I furnish the dollar.
- You furnish the fingers.
Now, are there any volunteers?
Step right up.
- Anyone at all?
-
Any volunteers in the crowd?
- Anybody at all...
-
I'll hold it.
The management
assumes no liability.
Now, madam, if you'll step back
on that little platform.
And there's no reason
for you to be nervous.
Now, madam,
hold out the dollar.
Wait! Don't fire!
She's holdin' a penny.
Shoot, Bill.
You're still fond of me,
aren't you, Powderface?
I've never known him
to be wrong.
But you can't stay here.
I can go
wherever you are.
Once, I made the mistake
of leaving you.
But I'm a man
on a wooden horse.
You saw for yourself tonight.
You wouldn't be
on a wooden horse...
if you'd go back to the people
who know you.
You don't belong
in this crowded ugliness.
Bill, let's go west tomorrow.
I'll never go west until I can look
an Indian in the face.
But you're all alone. What can you do
for the Indians here?
I don't know, but I know
that here is where it's got to be done.
Now don't forget. Aim at
the jet of water right under the ball.
- And squeeze. Don't pull.
-
- Good shot, Freddie.
Nice shot, Freddie.
You got an eye like an Indian.
Say, Buffalo Bill,
what are Indian kids like?
- What do they do?
- Do they have to go to school?
Sure, they go to school,
but not inside like you.
What do they learn?
'Rithmetic?
No. They learn to ride and fish
and hunt and swim.
I sure wish
I was an Indian.
Tell us about it,
Buffalo Bill.
Well, it-it's kinda hard
to tell about 'em.
But if you kids could see 300 of'em
on galloping ponies...
with their feathers flying,
it's something you'd never forget.
Three hundred Indians... charging
as they rode at War Bonnet Gorge.
It's a colossal idea!
And by the Lord Harry, we'll do it.
- Ned! What brought you back?
- Love for you, my boy.
I know a dozen promoters
who'd give up money for that idea.
What are we gonna do
with the Indians here in the city?
We'll put them in a show...
the greatest show the world ever saw!
Indians! Three hundred, 500...
a thousand of them!
If the East won't
go to the West...
kiddies, we'll bring
the West to the East!
-
Great performance!
It was bully! Bully!
Ladies and gentlemen...
the show which you
have seen tonight...
has lived a long time...
because it found a place
in your hearts.
But now, the time
has come to say...
not good night,
as on former occasions...
but good-bye.
Hand-in-hand,
my wife and I...
to the sunset.
And so...
and you grown-ups
who used to sit there...
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart...
for all you've meant to me.
Good-bye.
God bless you.
And God bless you too,
Buffalo Bill.
