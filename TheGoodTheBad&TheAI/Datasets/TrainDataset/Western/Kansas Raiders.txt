For more than
four long bitter years
this nation
was torn by a civil war.
The bloodiest
and most destructive
in our history.
For it was a war
of neighbor against neighbor,
family against family,
brother against brother,
Nor was the slaughter
confined to the armies
of the North and South alone.
There was a war-bred
outlaw army of guerrillas
masquerading under the flags
of both sides
The most savage
and merciless
among the lawless tribes
whose organized violence
terrorized the country
were the men
who marched, raided and killed
under the ominous black flag
of William Clarke Quantrill.
Well, sir, there she is,
Lawrence, Kansas.
Figure we oughta ride through
or had we better go around?
Well, why shouldn't we
ride through?
Because a town that big
is bound to have a sizeable
troop of Union soldiers in it.
I ain't scared
of no Union soldiers,
it's them Redlegs
that worries me.
How come a man gets
mean enough
to want to be a Redleg?
My pappy says
there ain't nobody meaner.
He says they're just acting
like they're working
for the Union Army
so's they have a chance
to kill and rob decent folks.
Well, are we gonna
sit up here all day and gab
or are we gonna move on?
See how that thing
reads, Frank.
"Scores counted dead
in New York draft riots.
"Fall of Vicksburg.
Mississippi opened
to Union forces.
"Quantrill guerrillas
strike Kansas border
with fire and swords."
Quantrill must be
quite some man.
Looks like these town folks
is kinda jumpy, Jess.
You think
we ought to stop here
or keep on moving?
Don't look like
we're gonna have much to say
about it one way or another.
Redlegs!
Which one of you
does the talking?
What do you want to know?
What're you doing
in this town?
Just passing through.
Where to?
We ain't just sure.
If you're so set
on finding out,
you're welcome to tag along.
If they ain't Quantrill's men,
I'm a horse thief.
So Quantrill sent you in
to do a little spying, huh?
Quantrill? Never laid eyes
on the man.
That's not what
I asked you.
You got
your answer, Mister.
What your names? You.
Jesse James.
Frank James.
You brothers?
Yep.
Cole Younger.
Jim Younger.
You brothers, too?
That's right.
Kit Dalton.
What's the matter?
Ain't you got no brothers?
Oh, I got
a couple of brothers
back home,
but they were
smart enough to stay there.
How long you fellows
been with Quantrill?
I asked you a question!
done that once already.
You fellows
don't seem to realize
that there's a war
going on.
Maybe for you there is,
but it ain't no concern to us.
In the border country
you're either a Union man
or a spy.
The Union men
get put in the army,
the spies get hung.
Ain't much
of a choice, is it?
When it comes
to joining an army,
we'll just make up
our own minds.
All right,
and we'll see you get
a nice legal court-martial
before the hanging.
Hold it!
What's all this talk
about lynching someone?
We caught these five
snooping around town.
They're Quantrill men.
Is that true?
I been trying' to tell him
we ain't,
but he seems more set
on hanging us than hearing
what we got to say.
Well, what have you
got to say?
Are you Quantrill men,
or aren't you?
No, sir.
Turn 'em loose.
Now look here...
Just a minute!
Till I get orders
to the contrary,
I'm in command
of the military here.
What're you trying to do?
Go Quantrill one better,
hanging little kids?
Quantrill never done
no such thing.
See? What'd I tell you?
That's enough.
Get on your way, boys.
Captain, I'm obliged to you
for speaking' up
for us back there
Forget it, son.
I'd like to give you
a piece of advice.
If you are figuring
on joining Quantrill,
don't do it.
Thanks, but we don't want
that kind of advice.
All right,
then take a warning.
Quantrill and what's left
of his guerrillas are as good
as hung right now.
If that's what
you're looking for, go ahead.
I wonder if they would have
really strung us up
back there?
You reckon so, Jesse?
I reckon.
We'd either be swinging
right now or fighting
for the Yankees.
You know that Captain
didn't come in any too soon.
I sure thought we was gone
when old Jess busted out
and stuck up for Quantrill
that way.
I don't like to stand by
and see nobody blacken
a man's name.
To hear you talk,
you'd think you and Quantrill
was old friends.
A real fighting man.
You know, I'm wondering
why that Captain let us go.
He had a mighty good notion
where we was going.
Yeah, he did.
I'd kinda like
to remember him.
To hear the Yankees tell it,
Quantrill's got two horns,
two hoofs and a long tail.
He sure must be
a real man at that
Chewing up
that Union cavalry faster
than the Yankees
can send them out here.
Him and 50 men
whipped a whole regiment
at Gainesville, I hear.
Well, I wonder
if we're getting
near his camp.
or them Redlegs back in town
wouldn't have been so scared.
You know,
riding with a man
like Quantrill,
we're liable to all
be famous one of these days,
that is if the war
lasts long enough.
Might have our own outfits,
a company,
a whole regiment even.
I can see me now,
riding at the head
of 100 men
in a spanking grey uniform
and black shiny boots.
Man, there ain't
nothing' wrong with that!
Nothing, except the pay.
The regular army
ain't no place
for an ambitious man.
I suppose
you expect to get rich.
Uh-huh.
How're you gonna get rich?
Fighting Yankees?
Don't you know them banks
in them Yankee towns
are just bulging with money?
Yeah,
but that'd be stealing.
With the regulars
it would,
but not with
a guerrilla outfit
like Quantrill's.
Well, what do you know?
What do you say
about that, Jesse?
Well, the bank's got
plenty of money in it,
no harm taking
a little of it, I guess,
in war time, anyway.
Looks like our Mr. Quantrill
is close by these parts
sure enough.
Well, they couldn't have known
much about their trade.
nosing around
a Southern guerrilla outfit
dressed up like Redlegs.
Well, if they were spies
they got just what was
coming to them.
Maybe he's the kind of a man
that likes a hanging
every so often.
Hello. Can we be
of any further help to you?
That trace pulled loose.
Would you mind
hooking it up for me?
Kit.
Don't believe
I've seen you boys
around here before, have I?
No.
Just drifting, huh?
Wouldn't be heading
for Quantrill's headquarters,
would you?
Maybe.
What do you think
he's running,
a nursery school?
Thanks anyway.
More recruits
for the butcher brigade.
Don't you know about women?
They can't talk no other way.
She could be real pretty
if she weren't looking so mad.
Well, we'd better get going,
or the war'll be over
and we'll be old men
before we even see Quantrill.
Yeah, come on, Jesse,
let's go
It's about that time,
ain't it?
It's long past.
He's late today.
Looks like a bad day
for them Yankees.
Every day's a bad day
for them Yankees
when Quantrill holds court.
All right.
Follow me!
Come on,
step out. Come on.
Come on there,
come on!
All right, right in here.
Line up, come on.
Get in there.
Come on, get in line
over there, come on.
Right over there,
come on!
You're under military arrest
as enemy spies.
But it has always been
my policy to permit
my enemies
to speak in their own defense
before pronouncing sentence.
We're not enemy spies!
We're soldiers, sir,
in the uniform
of the Northern Army.
We were ambushed by your men
while on a scouting mission
We demand
the customary treatment
accorded prisoners of war
You'll get
the customary treatment
of enemy spies.
All right, move out,
Come on!
Step out there.
Well, fella,
what've you got to say?
They ain't nothing I could say
that'd bring back my wife
and children, is there?
You fired on my soldiers!
Not till after they murdered
my family, I didn't.
Fortunes of war, mister.
Women and babies
don't fight nobody.
That man led
your drunken raiders
onto my place
and shot 'em down
when they was running
for safety.
You call them soldiers?
They're cowardly,
thieving killers!
Robbing, burning,
shooting at anything
or anybody
without a chance or warning.
You call that war?
Put that away, Tate.
Mr. Anderson,
whom have we here?
Prowlers, Colonel.
The dangerous kind,
Colonel.
Probably in the pay
of the Redlegs,
I suggest we get rid of them
along with the others
Yeah, plenty young
and plenty fresh.
They look like
good boys to me.
What are you doing here?
We came to join up.
Can you ride?
Can you shoot?
We do fair.
Can you fight?
Do you want to fight?
Well, that's what we rode
all the way from Missouri for,
Mr. Quantrill.
Colonel Quantrill.
Well, you'll sort of have to
excuse us, Colonel,
we ain't had
too much experience
with uniforms.
So you want a fight, huh?
This is
my second-in-command,
Mr. Anderson,
my third, Rudolph Tate.
Five of you, huh?
Well, we'll swear 'em
in tonight.
In the meantime,
they're all yours, Mr. Tate.
All mine, sir?
Within reason.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Where you kids come from?
Just told you,
down Missouri way.
I didn't know they let you
put on long pants
so young down there.
What you boys figure
on doing in this outfit?
Mind the horses
while the men do the fighting?
We figure on minding
our own business
if others
will do the same.
What you mean
by that, boy?
Look, mister, why don't you
go on about your chores
and stop making out
such a hard case.
Maybe you think
I ain't a hard case.
You look hard enough
on the outside,
but that don't say
what you've got
on the inside.
Well, this is where
you get your chance
to find out, sonny.
Looks like somebody's gonna
have to fight the man.
I'll take him, Jesse.
Let me fight.
No.
Looks like I'm the one
he's taken a hankering for.
Just you name it,
sonny.
All right, I may as well
make it for keeps.
Looks like that's the only way
we're gonna have
any peace around here
Frank, find us
a couple of knives.
He's got a lot of nerve,
that kid.
I once seen a couple fellas
cut each other to pieces
in one of them
handkerchief fights.
You know the rules.
First one that lets go
of the handkerchief loses.
I know, I know!
I just hope you know 'em
'cause you gonna need 'em
when I get through with him.
Take your time, Mister,
you ain't likely to have
too much of it left.
All right, Tate,
show him how tough you are!
That youngster meant it
when he said
he wanted to fight.
Yeah.
You've got
the wrong idea, ma'am.
It was either him or me.
Besides, it didn't look like
none of his friends
was gonna bury him.
Quantrill told him
to pick a fight with you
to test your mettle.
He could've stopped it,
couldn't he?
Why don't you go home?
Go home and take
your kid friends with you.
First off, we don't have
no homes left to go back to.
The Yanks took care of that.
That's why
the Colonel's enemies
are ours.
Do you think
Quantrill's fighting a war?
You heard that farmer talk
about his murdered family,
didn't you?
You know about the robbed
and burned-out homes.
Quantrill's responsible
for that,
for all of it.
He ordered it!
I don't think the Colonel
would do a thing like that.
and so was Rudolph Tate.
The troops are mounted
and ready, sir.
Very good, Lieutenant.
Any word from
the reconnaissance patrol?
No, sir.
The patrol's
six hours overdue.
I don't like it.
Think they might've
been trapped
in a guerrilla ambush, sir?
We could get there
a lot faster, Captain, if we
knew where we were going.
We should've
had that information
two hours ago.
Information that would
lead us straight
to Quantrill's headquarters.
Give him
a half-hour more.
Him?
We've got a man in their camp
in the pay of the Union Army.
You mean, sir, we've got a spy
in Quantrill's camp?
That's right.
He's one of Quantrill's
right-hand men,
Rudolph Tate.
What kind of show
you figure this is
gonna be, Jesse?
I don't know,
but it looks like
we're gonna find out
Maybe the Colonel's fixing
to roast a couple of Yankees
for his supper.
I heard when Quantrill
swears anyone in,
he likes it
kinda fancy-like.
All right, on your feet!
Where are the candidates?
Right over there, sir.
You five, down here.
Comrades and fellow soldiers,
we are gathered here
to take into our midst,
if they be worthy,
five volunteers
in the service of
Quantrill's Guerrilla Arny.
Are those five prepared
to take the oath?
We are.
Do you swear never to betray
a comrade of this band
or ever to reveal
a single secret
of this organization
or a single word of this,
your oath?
We swear.
Do you further swear
never to desert
a comrade who is in peril,
or ever, even in the face
of certain death
permit him to fall into
the hands of our enemies?
We swear.
Then Frank and Jesse James,
Cole and Jim Younger,
Kit Dalton,
you are henceforth
and forevermore sworn comrades
and blood brothers
of this, the company
of Quantrill's Guerilla Army.
Congratulations, Mr. James,
you're now one of us.
Thank you, sir.
You're the leader
of this group, I presume?
Well, I wouldn't
say that, sir.
He wouldn't,
but the rest of us will.
You bet.
Come on in to headquarters,
I'd like to talk
with you a minute.
Mr. Anderson, you can
break out the grog.
Kate,
this is Jesse James.
I want you two
to be friends.
You should've seen
the way he handled
Rudolph Tate this morning.
I did.
Oh, I meant to ask you
about that, Colonel.
Why did he prod me that way?
I didn't give him no cause
to pick on me.
'Cause he was mean,
an untruthful man,
always was that way,
no good.
He was good enough for you
until today.
That's because I had to
put up with him, Kate,
you know that.
But I never did trust him.
Good riddance.
We'll drink to it.
Come here,
I wanna show you something.
Do you know
where this war
is gonna be won?
Here, right here in the West.
You know who's gonna win it?
We are.
Now this, my boy,
is what we call
"grand strategy".
Now here's
the approximate position
of the armies right now.
Lee is retreating
from Gettysburg,
New Orleans and Vicksburg
have fallen
leaving the entire length
of the Mississippi
open to the Union forces.
Now, what does that mean?
Well, the way I see it,
it means our side
ain't doing so good.
It means that the South
is effectively surrounded,
now that the Northern Navies
control the seas.
Is it that bad?
No, no, no,
you missed the point!
This is just
the first phases,
the preliminary battles.
Let the North win the battles,
How we gonna do that
if they keep on licking us
all the time?
Because we're only
giving ground,
the North is giving men.
And the manpower of the North
is not completely
inexhaustible.
Lee's strategy
has been good on the whole,
quite good.
Although as yet,
he's not seen
far enough ahead
but he will.
Come on, drink up.
What's the matter,
don't you like this stuff?
It's just that
I ain't so used to it.
Oh.
Well, now here's
what I mean.
When Lee eventually realizes
the hopelessness
of his present position,
There's only
one possibility.
Here, the West.
May take months, even years.
But here
he can bide his time,
gather his strength
for that great counter-attack
that will drive
the Union Army into the sea.
If he could get
his men on this side
of the Mississippi,
the Yanks would
never dare cross.
There you are.
I knew you had
a head for strategy.
Now you know why I said
that we will win the war!
That's our great task.
Our glorious cause.
Our gateway
to immortal fame.
That Colonel Quantrill
sure chatters
like a magpie, don't he?
Mighty near give me
an earache.
My ole pappy used to say
that if a man
talked long enough
and loud enough
somebody's sure
to believe him.
Yeah, that's what
worries me
Jesse hangs on pretty near
every word Quantrill says.
We'll sweep 'em
into the sea.
I'll be second-in-command
to Lee himself,
after all Lee's no longer
a young man.
Now, with my strategy...
Stop it!
Haven't you given the boy
enough strategy for one night?
I guess you're right,
my dear.
The hour is late.
I was just gonna say I...
I think I ought to be going.
Goodnight, Colonel.
Goodnight, my boy.
Goodnight, Miss Kate.
You'll have to excuse me,
I ain't so used to it.
What are you trying to do
to that boy?
Stuffing his head
with all your nonsense.
Nonsense?
I meant
every word of it, Kate.
Every word of it.
Can't you realize
how useful that boy
can be to me?
You saw his devotion.
Who knows, maybe someday
he might even share my power.
I'll tell you
what's the matter.
Everyday you're becoming
more and more
a blood-thirsty murderer.
Strategy...
Strategy...
Here, come on, Jesse, wake up.
Come on, Jesse, come on.
Frank,
the Yanks will never
cross the Mississippi.
That's right, Jess,
and neither will you
if you don't get some sleep.
Come on.
I tell you, Frank...
Well, will you look
at Old Jess?
Jess boy, you and the old man
must've really
got along first rate.
Well, how does it feel
to be a member of the grand
and glorious secret order
of the Quantrill Clowns?
Jesse, Jesse,
come on, boy.
I'll have nobody
talking about him like that.
He's a great man.
Jess, my boy,
you're drunk.
Oh, shut up, will you, Kit?
Come on, Jess,
he was only funning
with you.
Hey, Jesse,
where do you suppose
the Colonel got that uniform?
Look like it come
right out of a store window.
I'd sure like to have me
an outfit like that.
You gotta be a Colonel
to have one of them
and you gotta talk
like a Colonel, too.
Well, boy, if he can fight
like he can talk,
he sure must be something.
Goodnight, Frank, Jesse.
Goodnight, Kit.
Goodnight.
He is a great man,
ain't he, Frank?
Hmm?
Yeah. Yeah,
sure he is, Jess.
Go on to sleep.
Do you understand
your orders, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
Good luck.
And another thing,
Tell the Colonel the quicker
he sends reinforcements,
the safer it's going to be
for the town of Lawrence.
Very well, sir.
Good luck.
Left by twos! Forward all.
That's good, huh?
Good?
It's like I been
kicked in the head
by a Missouri mule.
Was I?
You weren't kicked by one,
you were just trying
to drink like one.
Now, here, put this on
and straighten yourself up,
the old man wants
to see you right away.
Well, when you put that on,
you're officially a member
of the Quantrill Raiders.
Oh, good.
Say, Frank, I didn't do
anything wrong last night,
did I?
I ain't sure,
but by the looks of things
you seem to have done
just about right.
He wants
to see you right away.
What's that
supposed to mean?
We're going on a raid.
Raid? You mean us,
the whole outfit?
Yep, we're leaving
right away.
Quantrill's talking
to the group leaders
right now.
So get a move on,
I'll saddle up for you.
As you all know our objective
is another enemy strong point
similar to those
that we've been attacking
with such excellent results
these past several months.
The very cause
of the Confederacy itself
may well depend
upon our success.
I want every man to know that
and to act accordingly.
Sorry, Colonel.
One more thing.
Now that Mr. James is here,
he will act as group leader
of his own recruits
replacing the late Mr. Tate.
Any questions?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Anderson.
The men ain't gonna like it.
Like what?
Having this kid
put over for him.
There's plenty other
deserves it more
and been here a lot longer.
As long as I'm in command here
I'll give the orders
and make the appointments.
Mr. James, have you
had your breakfast?
No, sir.
Napoleon made
the profound observation
that an army travels
on its stomach.
I suggest you fortify yours
if you hope to be
of any use to us.
I've arranged
for your breakfast inside.
Thank you, sir.
Come in.
The Colonel said that...
Yes, I know. Sit down.
You don't have much time.
Thank you.
The Colonel made me
an officer just now.
Oh? He likes
ambitious, young men.
He's decided you've got
a head for strategy.
I don't know about strategy,
but I sure got a head.
I sure hope I wasn't
too much trouble to you
last night.
Oh, you weren't
any trouble.
You were just
a little tongue-tied,
that was all.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yes. Every time
the liquor was passed,
you just couldn't manage
to say the word "no".
Yeah, I guess, I did try
to learn about that stuff
a little too fast.
You'll catch on
quick enough.
You'll catch on
to a lot of things.
You've got
a good teacher.
Why did you
join Quantrill, Jesse?
You and Frank?
Do some killing.
What do you mean by that?
Something that happened
back home.
Something that I don't want
to ever see happen again.
There are some men that...
Well, they do things.
They gotta be killed.
Quantrill kills, too.
Yeah.
Yes, he does.
But only them
what's got it coming to 'em.
You better go.
I hope you've got
a good strong stomach!
Your stomach all right now?
There seems to be
an awful lot of talk
about my stomach this morning.
Well, maybe after last night,
folks just want to be sure
you've still got one.
Our point of attack
is that farmhouse.
I have information that
there's a troop of Union
soldiers quartered there.
Mr. Anderson, Mr. James,
you know the plan.
You'll start the attack
on the customary signal
from me.
Hey, James!
Better get
your share of the loot
before it's all gone.
Willis, where are
those Union soldiers
we were supposed to fight?
Grow up, James.
Quantrill always tells us that
just before every raid.
It makes him feel
like a real colonel.
I'm gonna
kill you for that.
Draw your gun.
Fortunes of war, Mr. James.
Bugler, sound the assembly.
Again.
Find him yet?
No.
Where you reckon
he's keeping himself?
We ain't hardly seen him
for the last three days.
He ain't a preacher
or a preacher's son.
He ought to know
how things go
in an outfit like this.
Well, I don't know.
He don't always see everything
the same as other people.
Maybe it'd be better
If he did.
You don't suppose he just up
and rode away without saying
nothing, do you?
Nope. Jesse wouldn't
do that to us.
Well, he's hardly
said a word to us
since we came back
from that first raid.
We don't have to,
we know what he's thinking.
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking this may not be
the sweetest smelling
way to live,
but it's downright better
than walking behind a plow.
Right.
Maybe it is
and maybe it ain't.
Come on, deal me in.
Haven't seen you
around for a few days.
Tell me,
how did you enjoy
your first taste
of Quantrill warfare?
Warfare?
Well, I can't say you didn't
try hard enough to warn me.
Thanks.
Maybe you're not
like the others,
maybe I was wrong.
Was I?
I guess
I ain't so different.
But you could be,
Jesse.
You could be.
How?
Quantrill's going on
another raid.
He's been
looking for you.
Well, I ain't ridin'
with him no more.
Are you going to
tell him that?
Yes, I am.
Mr. James,
you're late again.
You've kept me waiting.
I ain't ridin'
with you, Colonel.
Not riding with us?
May I ask why?
I been thinking all night.
I been thinking
for three days.
Thinking about what?
What I ought to say
and now I got to say it.
I came here to fight.
Came here straight
from my home, what's left
of it three weeks ago.
That was the day Frank and me
came home and found
the house burnin',
my ma with her arm shot off,
my pa hangin' in the tree
in the front yard.
It was Red Legs.
Yankee guerrillas.
One of 'em drunk
and was still there.
I come here because
I wanted to kill every man
I could ever find
that would do
a thing like that.
Then we went out
on that raid the other day.
I found we was
doin' the same thing.
We was murderin' people
that didn't have no chance.
People just like my ma and pa.
Maybe that's strategy,
Colonel,
and maybe
I don't understand it
but you don't need me
for what you're
gonna do tonight.
Maybe we don't need you
for nothin' at all.
Put that gun away,
Mr. Anderson.
Are you sure
you don't want me to...
You heard what I said.
Put that gun away.
I suggest, Mr. James,
that you remain
behind on this trip.
You sure you know
what you're doing,
Jess?
Hello, Jesse.
I thought
I'd find you here.
Are you thinking maybe
you should've gone
on that raid?
No.
I was just thinkin'
about the Colonel.
I ain't never been
much of one to judge people
for what they have been,
or even what they are.
It's the way
they feel inside.
Sometimes a man or a woman
will get into a thing
and well, they just
can't get out of it.
But it's not that way
with the Colonel.
He can get out of it.
It comes hard for me
to place all the blame
on him.
After all there's Anderson,
and all them others
I'm not asking you
to blame him.
But, Jesse, listen to me.
Bloodshed and murder
don't mean anything
to Quantrill.
It's all part of a dream,
a dream of playing war.
But the people he kills
are real people.
He saved my life,
did you know that?
Yes, I know.
He saved mine once,
too, in a way.
Don't you...
Don't you feel nothin'
for him no more at all?
No. I did once.
I believed everything
he said.
Until I began
to see for myself.
I'd see them
come riding home
night after night.
Some of them,
still had the blood
on their hands.
Don't you see what
they're doing is wrong,
terribly wrong.
No matter what
you feel about him,
he'll die
at the end of a rope,
and if you follow him,
so will you.
Jesse, you've got to
get out of here.
I'll never get out
any other way.
If you won't do it
for yourself,
then do it for me.
We couldn't just
ride off without...
Well, then we'll tell him.
Tell him just like you did
this morning.
Jesse, you're not afraid,
are you?
Mr. Anderson, see that
the boys don't make too much
of a night of it tonight.
All right,
you heard him.
Well, my boy,
I'm glad to find you here.
I thought that after
this morning, you might be
angry at me.
I see you're not.
That's fine.
How are you, Kate?
Have a nice day?
I want to talk
to you, Colonel.
I want to talk to you,
too, Jesse.
I've been thinking
about you all day
and what you said.
But first I have something
to say to Kate.
If you'll wait
for me outside.
Go ahead, Jesse.
Now,
where did you get this?
He gave it to me.
Jesse?
Yes.
I see.
Very pretty.
My dear Kate,
I'm too old a man to have
any illusions about
the constancy of women,
or to be
seriously disturbed
by the lack of it
but when your intrigues
start interfering
with my plans
that's something
else again.
He's man enough
for my purposes.
If you want to help him,
stay away from him.
Jesse,
you've been thinking
some pretty harsh things
about me, haven't you?
I don't know what
to think no more.
You've been
talking to Kate?
Yes, I have.
There are some things
that a woman simply
cannot comprehend.
A leader is a lonely man.
There are so few
that he can trust.
And even they often fail
to understand
just when he needs
their understanding most.
Do you think it's by choice
that I lead this rabble?
Do you think I condone
their brutality any more
than you do?
General Lee needs me
and through me,
he needs you.
And in the days to come,
we're going to need you more.
All I want is one word
from you, Colonel,
there won't be no more
of what happened
on my first raid.
My boy, you have it.
Then I'm with you.
I knew you would be.
Now that we understand
each other, I can tell you,
our next engagement
will be a major one
of vital importance
to the Confederate Cause.
We're going to raid
the town of Lawrence,
Kansas.
Lawrence, Kansas.
You better get some rest.
Jesse,
what I said about
your being a candidate
for the butcher brigade
still goes.
But you were all wrong, Kate.
Everything's gonna be
all right now.
The Colonel
gave me his word.
His word.
And you believed him.
Like I said, Jesse,
Kate's a woman.
There are certain things
that she'll never comprehend.
Good night, Kate.
Good night, Colonel.
Good night, my boy.
You have a winning way
with children, Colonel.
Thank you, Kate.
My information is
that the town's
only defense
consists of a few
Red Legs and a handful
of Union soldiers.
Mr. Anderson,
you will be in charge
of any military
or civilian opposition.
Mr. James,
your objective
will be the bank.
Just make it clear
to Mr. James that
that bank money ain't his.
You understand that,
Mr. James?
I understand that,
Anderson.
Do you understand that
we're fightin' soldiers
and not shootin'
unarmed civilians
in the back?
Mr. Pell,
you'll take charge
of posting pickets
to guard against
any return of
the Yankee soldiers.
Yes, sir.
We'll advance on
the usual signal from me.
Quantrill. Quantrill!
We don't want to
have to shoot nobody,
and we won't
if you keep your hands
where we can see them.
Who runs this place?
I do.
General Lee wants
all the Yankee money
you've got.
Where do you keep it?
You boys are going to
regret this day's work.
You're gonna regret it
a lot more if you
don't open that safe.
Next time it won't
be your hand.
Kit.
I told you these Yankee banks
were just bulgin' with money.
Fortunes of war, mister.
Why, you little...
General Lee's gonna be
much obliged to you.
Will. Will.
Will.
Murderers. Murderers!
Hey, James. Look here.
Come here.
See here, James?
See here?
Just like
the Colonel ordered.
We ain't killin'
no unarmed men
and women.
This here is
a military prisoner.
I'll take that prisoner,
Anderson.
Oh, you will, huh?
Better get off
the street, Captain.
I can't see.
Frank, take him inside.
Wait a minute.
I know that voice.
Don't I know you?
No.
Come on, Captain.
This way.
Thank you, thank you, sir.
You're most kind.
You have earned the undying
gratitude of Quantrill.
And mark you, gentlemen,
the day will come when
the favor of Quantrill
will be worth
a king's ransom.
Far more than these paltry
trinkets which you so kindly
donate to my cause today.
A very fine piece.
A family heirloom,
no doubt.
That's all. Dismissed.
And you, sir?
Well, what have we here?
Some more
family heirlooms?
Mr. Quantrill?
Colonel Quantrill,
Mr. James.
Your men are shooting
unarmed civilians.
What are you
gonna do about it?
If you don't like the way
we're fighting the war,
Mr. James, tell Mr. Anderson.
I just killed him.
You...
Colonel. Colonel.
Yankee cavalry
are headin' this way.
Looks like
the whole Union Army.
Tell the bugler
to sound assembly.
Gentlemen, gather up
our contributions.
We're moving.
Ready to ride, men?
Yeah.
I don't know where
you're aimin' to go when
you leave us, Jesse,
or what you plan on
doin' once you get there
but, whatever it is,
you ain't gonna be no
better off than you are now.
Like my old pappy
used to say,
a hog that straddles
a fence ain't likely
to wind up no place.
Our old pappy
was always right,
Jess.
Stayin' here's better
than plowin' from sun up
to dark
and livin' on side-meat
and corn bread
and never havin'
a dollar you don't
owe somebody.
Can't you see, Jesse?
This is the life.
Plenty money, shootin',
gamblin', sleepin'.
He knows
what he's doing.
Are you aimin'
to ride back
to Missouri, Jess?
Maybe.
Look, Jess,
ain't nothin' back there
except a blackened chimney
where your house once stood.
And a couple of new graves
coverin' your folks,
where the Yankees
and the Red Legs put 'em.
You can't go back
to Missouri, Jess.
We're already marked
with the Quantrill brand
and if the Yanks
don't hang you,
the law will.
Can't get no revenge
rottin' in somebody's jail
or swingin'
on the end of a rope.
My old pappy
used to say that...
Yeah, I know! Your old pappy.
Well, some of what
you say does make sense.
Guess I'll ride
with the Colonel
a while longer.
Again
and again they raided,
looted, burned
and destroyed,
following Quantrill
and his ominous black flag
brutality and destruction
of life and property.
spurred on by
the people's angry voices,
slowly cut down the size
of the Quantrill band.
Day after day
they became fewer and fewer.
Well, gentlemen,
you know what that
signal means.
Sure we know
what it means.
What are we
gonna do about it?
We're gonna make a stand
right here and fight until
there's not a man of us left.
The men in ain't
no shape to fight, Colonel,
even if they wanted to.
There ain't
but one thing to do.
Split up.
Every man for himself.
Do you mean to question
my authority?
You ain't got
no authority left,
Colonel.
We ain't only fightin'
the Union Army now,
the whole state
of Kansas is after us.
And when General Lee
turned against you,
we all decided
it was time to quit.
All right,
get out all of you.
Come on, men.
Well, why don't you
desert with the rest
of them?
We're sticking
with you, sir.
We'll proceed at once
to my Kentucky headquarters.
You're forgetting
something, Colonel.
What's that?
Kate. We're not
leaving her.
Very well, Mr. James.
Looks like the Yankees
got here first.
They may still be here.
Kate's either...
There's only one way
to find out. Wait here.
You didn't expect us
to leave you here,
did you?
Where are
the rest of the men?
They deserted.
A commander
without an army.
Dismount
and take cover.
Are you hit, Colonel?
It's my eyes, Jesse,
Cole, get Kate
and let's get outta here.
You know,
it's a funny thing,
him gettin' it
in the eyes like that.
Just the same
as that Union Captain.
Yeah.
War is war.
It's mighty funny,
all the same.
Just like it was some kind
of judgment on him
or somethin'.
Any better now, Colonel?
I can't see, Jesse.
We should've had
some hot water.
The whole country side's
swarming with Union soldiers,
I must look quite
thoroughly disreputable,
I'd hate to run into
any of my fellow officers
in this condition.
I don't imagine there'd be
any sudden danger of that.
You know,
I've been thinking
considering the circumstances
and my present condition
it would be well
if you would assume
command, temporarily.
Yes, I think
that would be best.
All right, Colonel,
if that's the way
you want it.
Well, so be it then.
Now that you're
the Colonel, Jesse,
where you gonna get us
somethin' to eat?
You know what Napoleon
said, an army travels
on its stomach.
Yeah, but Napoleon
didn't have my kind
of an army.
Yeah, well...
From the looks
of that road, Jesse,
there must've been
more than 100
Yankee troops
passed this way.
They're too close.
We been ridin' around
in circles for days now.
At this rate
we'll never break out.
What are we gonna do, Jesse?
We just have to
keep riding.
Cole, you and Kit
hide the horses.
Seems like
we've been here before,
don't it, Jesse?
It's burned out
so bad I can't tell.
Get inside,
Colonel.
Where are we, Kate?
Do you know this place?
Must have been
a nice place, once.
Wonder how
it got burned.
Red Legs most likely.
Yeah, Jesse. Red Legs.
Hey, Jesse.
Jesse.
Look here, what we found.
"$10,000 reward
for the capture or killing,
"or any information leading
to the capture or killing
"and the destroyer
of Lawrence, Kansas,
"and any member of his band
who may be with him."
Any member of his band
that may be with him?
That means us,
don't it, Jesse?
Is that better?
Yes. Thank you, Kate.
Kate, we haven't had
a talk for a long time.
Don't you think...
You ought to get some sleep.
Good night, Kate.
Of this place.
Then you have
been here before,
haven't you, Jesse?
On my first raid
with Quantrill.
He ordered it
burned himself.
You were right, Kate.
You been right all along
when you told me how
Quantrill and his kind
always wind up.
Yeah, I know.
Somehow I couldn't
leave him, either.
But you've got to, Jesse.
You know that.
And you've got to
pretty soon.
Every day it gets worse
and every day we take
more chances.
If they catch you with him,
you know what'll happen
to you.
To you and all of us.
Our finish will be
the same as his.
I just been puttin' off
thinkin' about it, I guess.
You can't put it off
any longer, Jesse.
It isn't fair
to the boys either.
You're young,
you've got your whole life
ahead of you.
Someday you'll want to
settle down, a wife and kids.
A place of your own.
I'll never want nobody
but you, Kate.
Hello.
Anybody inside?
What do you want?
We saw smoke coming
from your chimney,
I just wanted to ask if...
Oh, this time
I do know you.
My men have
this place surrounded.
We've been looking for you
and your Colonel.
How many men do you think
you'll have left when you
get him?
Maybe I do
owe you something.
I don't know.
I don't want any more killing
if I can help it.
I'll give you until daylight
to surrender the Colonel,
then we're coming in
after you.
Well, we've got
until daylight.
Listen, Jesse. I ain't
gonna get hung for what
the old Colonel's done.
I didn't notice you
bein' so fussy
about what
the old Colonel done
a while back.
Jesse.
You're all right,
you're a fine boy.
We'll get through,
don't you fear.
There're still great days
ahead for Quantrill
and you'll share them,
all of you.
We know that,
Colonel. Thanks.
Better try
to get some sleep.
Yeah. I can sleep now.
Jesse?
We've been doin'
some thinkin' on our own.
We can make a deal
with that Yankee Captain.
$10,000 is a lot of money.
We're gonna turn him in
and collect the reward money.
It's him they
really want, not us.
No.
But it's him or us.
It's him or us, all right.
Not that way.
What other way is there?
You don't trust them Yankees
to make a deal with us,
do you?
Remember that reward notice
read "Dead or alive.
"And any member of his band
that might be with him".
Have you figured
some other way, Jesse?
In a couple of hours
when things settle down
out there,
we'll make it out
the back way
down to the creek bed
and come in behind them
to the horses.
You heard that, Kate?
Get ready to go.
What about him?
He'd never get through.
They've got just about
one hour more.
Now we all know what to do.
We'll stand a better chance
if we go out one at a time.
Kit, good luck.
Jim?
Cole?
Frank, take Kate with you.
Jesse.
Go along with Frank.
Jesse.
Go where?
With the others.
Yeah,
and I know why
you wouldn't.
Jesse, I want to
tell you something.
I guess from the beginning
I've been fooling myself.
I know I never fooled you.
Maybe I never fooled
anybody else.
But no more.
This is the end for me
and I know it.
I'm not going to sit by
and see you pay the penalty
for something
that you had no part in.
There are two things
we can do, Colonel,
make a fight of it here,
or try to get out
like the others did.
Like you said, Jesse,
you'd never get through
with me,
a blind man.
I figured
you'd want to fight.
I was gettin' things ready.
Suppose I told you
this is the way I wanted it,
suppose I ordered you to go?
It wouldn't do you
any good.
Why?
You said I was givin'
the orders, remember?
Mr. James,
You're to go.
That's an order,
Mr. James.
Did you hear me?
Either fight together
or break through together.
Chances ain't too good,
you know.
Are they any better here?
Help me with my coat.
Have to hurry, Colonel,
it's getting light out.
Jesse,
if I don't make it...
You see any of them?
They're mostly
around in front.
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any
to make up our minds
where we're goin',
what we're gonna do.
I figure
with all the experience
I've picked up here lately
me and my brothers
could make a real good
go of it.
Well, that's fine, Kit.
Cole, how about you and Jim?
We figured on
stringin' along
with you two.
That is, if you don't
have any objections.
Jess, we'll just ride
out a ways and you
can catch up with us
You said once
you'd go anywhere with me.
Were you just saying that
or did you mean it?
Maybe then. But...
But what?
Look, Jesse,
in a few years
the war'll be over,
and everything will look
different to you then
and so would I.
Good bye, Jesse.
And so into the pages
of crime history,
Kit Dalton,
Cole and Jim Younger,
were to be a heritage
from their teacher,
