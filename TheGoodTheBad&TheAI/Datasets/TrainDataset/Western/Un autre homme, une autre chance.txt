ANOTHER  MAN,  ANOTHER  CHANCE
On July 19, 1870...
...Napoleon III
declared war on Prussia.
He lost the war in 6 weeks.
In Paris, legislative
representatives...
...formed a new government...
...under the presidency
of General Trochu.
The republic was proclaimed
at the City Hall of Paris.
Empress Eugenie has fled.
The Prussians encircle Paris along...
...50 miles of continuous front...
...manned by 150,000 troops...
...and 700 artillery weapons.
Paris is completely cut
off from the rest of France.
Two million Parisians...
...deprived of fuel and food...
...are suffering the worst fate...
...the city has ever known.
Horses and household pets...
...are killed for food...
...so are animals in the zoo.
Butchers sell dog, cat and rat meat.
Today, January 5, 1871...
...Paris is under artillery
attack for the first time.
People are taking
refuge in the cellars.
The Prussians demand a huge ransom...
...in gold to raise the siege.
Coming down to the cellar?
No...I'm more afraid of crowds...
...than of cannons.
Will I get to read your diary one day?
No...since it's my diary.
Sure you won't come down?
- No.
The war deprives
everyone of everything.
I'm deprived of the
thing I love most...
...music.
It's not a time for concerts.
The news isn't good.
There's no bread to distribute...
...before tonight...at best!
We're sorry, there's nothing left.
Nothing before tomorrow morning...
...maybe tonight...
we're terribly sorry.
How can you take pictures of that?
I'm a photographer...so
I take pictures.
Could you take my picture?
It's for my fiancé.
Come see me later...after the war.
- Thank you.
The first hundred will be served now.
There will be a second
serving this evening.
Later we'll talk of hope...
...and the Promised Land...
Follow me to see it firsthand.
Hey, J.B., I've rarely tasted
anything as bad as this!
Your pessimism is alarming.
A pessimist is an optimist...
...with experience.
After the war with Prussia...
...France will have a civil war.
That's nothing new...
Peace is always harder to win
than war.
"Build your own future...
...in a new land."
"America is within reach...
...via the French line...
...in 17 days for 135 francs."
Ever thought of going there?
"Photographer"
Your head there...don't move!
How many pictures do you want?
For my fiancé...his family...five.
That's expensive.
Can I pay you with bread.
...or any other food?
Well, well...the little baker-maid!
Yes, and I still don't
understand why...
...you took those pictures that day.
Photography wasn't invented...
...just to immortalize fiancées.
Don't move...don't talk.
What does your fiancé do?
What does your fiancé do?
You said not to move or talk.
If I ask, you can answer.
He's in the military...a lieutenant.
- Lieutenant?
- Yes.
I always wanted to cuckold
a lieutenant.
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Come get them next week.
Finished?
- Yes.
My most beautiful picture
since the war.
Thank you.
There aren't many cakes like this...
...in Paris tonight.
In honor of the
father of the fiancé...
My first all-butter cake...
...since the war began.
And in honor of the
sister of the fiancé...
...with the rose!
And now the time has come...
...to talk about the marriage.
Here's what I've
decided should be done.
May I say something first?
The fiancée has the floor...
I don't want to get married.
Delivering croissants for breakfast?
Sit down.
I'll get you a blanket.
What is it?
I want to learn to be a photographer.
You came to the right
place... I'm the best in Paris.
And I make the best coffee in Paris.
It's nice of you to take
up photography at 6 A.M.
Are we going to
cuckold the lieutenant?
The noblest part of the
camera: the objective lens!
One drawback: When there's
no sun, It has no memory.
It projects the image upside-down...
I'll show you why...
Sir?
- No sun...no pictures.
-I came about your advertisement.
All right.
- How are you.
- So this is it...
- Yep, this is it.
- Dirty, isn't it?
- Well, uhm... No.
- Photographer?
- Yes...sort of.
Madam.
- Good day to you, Sir.
Do you get lot of sun?
- Two hours...on clear days.
- As much as that...
I'll just have a look...
And the clientele?
Like the sun...like
Paris...like France.
The bedroom...
- How much?
- Two thousand.
- As much as that...
- Know how to haggle?
- A little.
If you haggle, I'll make It 1500.
With all accessories?
Except two cameras I'll take with me.
At 1500, I'd be Interested.
You shouldn't be!
It's falling apart.
I'm handy with tools...
People who aren't intelligent
can't understand...
...even when you tell them
they aren't intelligent.
You mean me?  - Yes.
- 1300 then?
Much better!
I leave with a clear conscience.
Where are you going?
Where the sun always
shines for photographers!
- Where's that?
- Out West in America.
- Indians!
- One thousand! All right?
Wait a second! One thousand...
Will that get you
there and set you up?
- You bet.
You've just given me an idea...
Maybe I'll leave, too...
instead of setting up here.
Can't you see I'm in
love with this lady?
That I want to tell her to?
I want to take her with me.
- Very well.
Have a nice trip!
And... Good luck!
You don't know me.
- What?
You don't know me.
I don't know America either.
For the trip.
- What's your name?
-Jeanne.
Could you stop moving for two seconds?
Will we ever see France again?
It's easier to return than to leave.
To talk about the future
spoils the present.
Is there nothing but numbers?
Where we're going we'd better
know how to count.
Not feeling well?
America's starting badly?
- I did an idiotic calculation.
- I'm not surprised.
At age 60, we'll have
spent 20 years in bed...
...3 years at table
and 6 months peeing.
I feel a little like vomiting.
But the sea is calm today.
Must be something else then.
That would be fine with me.
Really?
You know you're charming?
Is that why things happen
to me that I don't expect?
A man...
...a country...and perhaps a child.
- Let me through, please.
Excuse me, please.
- I'm feeling sick.
- Again!?
- I'm stopping when we reach New York.
- Oh.
- So does the sea.
Yes, but I'm staying in
New York anyway.
Going to lose him at last.
As these pictures show, civilization
has crossed the Atlantic.
The hardest part was the quarantine.
We're getting married soon.
I don't regret France or the fiancé
with the bright future.
Nor your fortune so curiously made
in time of war.
I'm happy, I'm expecting a child.
Tomorrow we start out West by train.
- What are these pictures?
-That's New York.
It looks dirty.
I hope that in time...
...you'll forgive me for
deciding my own destiny...
Jeanne.
- Can't understand a word
- Neither can I.
- Do you love me?
-Yes, I love you.
She loves me.
I don't understand a word you say,
but that's quite a face.
France is full of your
kind...that's why I left.
I wouldn't take your picture.
Want to rob us, huh?
You won't get that...
you won't get my cameras.
- Can we get rid of him?
- I don't know.
What will we name her if it's a girl?
- Sarah.
- Why Sarah?
You're sunburned.
Your nose is all red.
You haven't seen yours.
We're lucky we could go
partway by a wagon train.
Otherwise, it would've
taken us 6 months.
How much time has the train saved us?
Two months.
We still have 4 months in this wagon?
Yes...unless we stop
before we reach the Pacific.
Have you any ideas
about where we might stop?
I'm waiting for destiny
to give me a sign.
Four months...in this...
Is that good for the child
I'm carrying?
It's a hard country...
get it used to a hard life.
If there are Indians,
they're well hidden!
- Make a wish!
- Why?
Because you're going to
see your first Indian.
It's true, they are well hidden.
And?
Since the beginning, I've had a
bad feeling about the wagon master.
What was your wish?
You're not supposed to say your wish.
But there haven't been any Indians.
That we never be apart.
This afternoon,
in one of the wagons...
...a Polish woman read our palms.
I'm always impressed by people
who can see the future.
Where does their knowledge end,
and their imagination begin?
According to her, Francis and I...
...will be the characters
in a melodrama.
The things that happen to us will be
simple and dramatic.
America is the country
where Francis will die...
...and where I will live.
She said that...
...the child I'm expecting,
will be a girl.
She also said that
we'd never see France again.
I'm reassured by one contradiction
in all that.
Why would I live in this country
without Francis?
What's he saying now?
All I know is
he still doesn't like the French.
Three months since we've seen a town!
It's time for your destiny
to manifest itself.
What if that Polish woman was right.
- You'd make a pretty widow.
- Don't joke about such things!
If I can't joke about death,
what can I joke about?
You wouldn't mind knowing
everything in advance.
Destiny is only human...
it can make mistakes, too, sometimes.
Anyway, remember what I said
on the boat?
"Let's not spoil the present,
dicussing the future."
- What's he say?
- I can't understand him.
It smells bad.
No, thank you. Go ahead.
No thanks. Come on we're going.
Thank you.
What's he saying?
He's so big.
Don't haggle with destiny.
It's very, very nice.
Yes.
Francis!
The sun's going down
and there's a long line!
Please let me take one.
Oh, it's perfect.
It's a profession.
But there's still that line.
I don't know what to say
to them anymore.
-  Ha?
- I don't know what to say...
Francis!
What on earth is that?
If they won't come to me,
I'll go to them.
- An egg.
- An egg.
- Tomato.  - Domato.
- Tomato.  - Domato.
Domat... Well, close enough.
- Chicken.
- Chicken.  - Very good.
- Bread.
- Fred.
- No, not Fred. Bread.
- Fred.
Not exactly brilliant.
I'll repeat it in French.
From now on, you and I will
speak French when we're together.
A promise.
We'll try very, very hard.
Yes? Yes, Mom?
Yes, Mom?
Yes, Mom?
- Yes, Mom.
Oh, yes, Sarah, we must speak French.
Things aren't going very well in Paris.
You'll see Paris one day.
You and I will go for walks together.
Do you want to come? Me, too.
Well, there were Poles...
Russians...
...and French people, too.
Your dad, me...
There were Germans.
In fact, it was a German priest
who married us.
You were there, as well.
One day,
I'll tell you exactly where you were.
Do you understand me a little?
You want me to speak
to you in English, huh?
...a long rifle like this...
- Is it finished?
- Yes, it's finished.
I didn't have the courage to go see it.
No one knows why they were hanged?
No, no one knows why...
I'll develop this.
They're all savages.
Good thing you didn't come.
It wasn't pretty to see.
- Francis?
- What is it?
- Open up, please.
- Just a second. It's red light.
What is he saying?
He doesn't want to see the picture
of his sons in the newspaper.
- Give it to him.
- Right away.
There, it'll be great.
Can you say that, ratatouille?
Ratatouille. All right, let's eat
ratatouille. It's ready.
There, he got it perfectly.
That was very good!
- Thank you.
You want to speak French?
I'll teach you a few words...
- A glass.
- A glass.
- A bottle.
- Hm?
- A bottle.
- A bottle.
- Knife.
- Knife.
Now for some sentences...
The sky is blue.
The sky is blue.
- The sky is blue.
The sky is blue.
Another inversion! I'm fed up.
Even when you make a mistake,
I love you.
What's the tritest thing
a man can say to a woman?
Will you marry me?
Yes, she was right...
that Polish woman...
...I never saw France again!
