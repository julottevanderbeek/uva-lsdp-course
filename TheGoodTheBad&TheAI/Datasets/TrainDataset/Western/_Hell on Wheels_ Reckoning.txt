Previously on AMC’s Hell on Wheels…
Welcome to Cheyenne, madam.
Your railroad's stuck, Durant. I'm the
only one who  can get it movin' again.
I am not going over, Bohannon.
I am going through.
And without you.
That much powder's likely
to get us all killed.
People believe any one
of them is above the law,
there will be no law.
You work for me. I'll pay
you a decent wage.
Not a chance in hell.
We'll be fine.
Damn! Shelby put on some weight.
He loved a good pint, he did.
Bad one too, it feels like.
You're daft, Wallace.
Look it up if you don't believe me.
I'm a son of the emerald isle.
I know the lyrics to
and they're not, "You may search every hair,
but none shall compare… ”
They’re: “You may search everywhere… ”
Top o' the morning, Mr. Bohannon.
Come on.
Both: Whoa.
We thought you was for the Muck Wagon, sir.
Not yet, gentlemen.
Not yet.

I was worried about you
when you didn't come home.
I went to see the church lady.
Don't worry.
Wasn't her that done this.
Could have waited until the morning.
No, needed doing.
Asked her to help you and William.
The railroad can spare you for a day.
Can't take care of you and
the baby if I don't work.
Let me at least go get you some food.
Day's already wasting.
Oh, by all means, Bohannon,
make yourself at home.
Ooh.
Making friends, I see.
Real friendly town you got here.
What? What's the matter, Mr. Bohannon?
The local "Denizenry"
not taken with your rough charm?
"Denizenry" ain't a word.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it ain't.
Yes... anyway, I can have you arrested
for stealing government property.
Huntington's already through...
Through the sierras.
Your Chief engineer
almost got himself killed
proving he can’t blast through a shale mountain.
You need to try something else.
There is nothing else.
My surveyors could not find a
passable route over the peak.
Figured I'd give her another look.
Your job, out on the grade, Bohannon.
Not today.
Take this compass.
My Chief engineer broke that one.
That man should be fired.
He saved your life.
He is insubordinate and reckless.
He may well save the hash
you've made out of the tunnel.
The tunnel was your idea.
I have done exactly as you ordered.
You have not gotten me through Sherman Peak!
Bohannon stays.
I heard Fort Smith is harboring them mormons
who shot up town.
Ain't nothing stopping 'em
from saddling up and doing it again.
Why would a mormon make this town home?
None of her people are here.
She's married to Cullen Bohannon.
He's mormon too?
He's a railroad man.
Who took a child bride.
They don't know right from wrong
because they don't believe in the Bible.
It's true. Mormons are a violent cult.
If they don't seek redemption,
nothing will save them
from the fires of hell.
I need some kerosene...
And matches too.
Mormons do believe in the Bible.
And we also follow the
teachings of Jesus Christ,
particularly when it comes
to kindness to others.
Michael McGinnes?
There we go.
Y'all know very well who I am.
- I'm closing your casino.
- On what grounds?
This building is condemned by
order of the U.S. Government.
Clear it out!
On your feet! Hey!
- Come on, you whore.
- Get your damn hands off of me!
You, unhand that lady!
Get out!
- Come on!
-
Move it along!
Let's go, you dumb Mick.
That's enough, Mickey!
Shut down my bar, will you?
Get up. Get up!
Don't resist, Mickey. I'll get you out.
Hear that? Durant runs
this town, not you lot.
He'll have me out before the end of the day.
I trust the militia is treating you fairly.
Oh. Well, yes.
My internment has given
me the opportunity for...
Deep prayer and reflection.
I have been praying
for mine enemies,
as Jesus did during his incarceration
before crucifixion.
Bishop Dutson, please.
He is not a Bishop.
We all heard his confession.
What...
Exactly...
Did you hear?
You said you drowned the real Bishop Dutson.
Are you sure?
Did the ward clerk take any such notes?
No.
But I heard you.
You heard the holy spirit
speaking through your Bishop,
cleansing the soul of the man
who murdered your son.
That's not true.
No, be not afraid, brother Hatch.
You witnessed a spiritual event that day.
Visions, revelations,
sublime to witness,
yet difficult to discern.
He's twisting what happened.
He has a right to speak.
You have proposed that we hang him
for impersonating a Bishop.
Heavenly Father demands there be no doubt.
Praise God.
I telegraphed the mormon church,
from which the real Bishop joined us.
A reply is coming from Bishop Finch,
the head of the ward,
that will prove this man...
Needs justice.
Indeed, and may justice be done.
Praise God. Mm.
Whoa.
Come on.
Havana's finest, from my private stock.
You and I… we are both men
with experience enough to know
when we have the upper hand.
Agreed.
So let me say...
I admire your bold act
in closing the casino.
It showed strength.
And that site is perfect
for my new federal offices.
The designs for Campbell
Plaza are under way.
You've made your point, Mr. Campbell.
But we need hard men to build the railroad.
And in my experience,
they are never more dangerous
than when they are idle.
Now, Mr. McGinnes has proven
himself adept at offering
the right amusements to help manage the men.
Yes.
You are in a position to be magnanimous.
Well, he assaulted a federal marshal.
A rash act in the heat of the moment.
He'd be shot for that
offense in some states.
Well, let’s be grateful Wyoming
has not yet achieved statehood.
The mayor stays in jail.
Thank you for the cigars.
Hello?
Mrs. Bohannon.
I'm Ruth Cole.
- The church lady.
- Yes.
I wanted to apologize for
my behavior this morning.
It was unkind.
I hope you can forgive me.
Several women in the parish donated these.
You could meet them at church tomorrow.
- I know you’re not a believer…
- But I am…
In the Heavenly Father and His true prophet,
Joseph Smith.
I'll admit, I'm not well
versed in Mormonism.
Perhaps you could help me
understand why Joseph Smith
advocated polygamy, for instance.
Plural marriage is God's will.
- God's will?
- Yes.
The Lord commands us to
be fruitful and multiply
so that we can build the kingdom
of the latter-day saints.
But that kingdom is predicated
on the exploitation of women,
forcing them to share husbands,
refusing to allow them
to be ordained as clergy.
You... you must see the injustice in that.
I see clarity in it.
I know who I'm meant to be...
A woman whose place is in the home
looking after her children.
The service is at 10:00.
So...
About what time do you expect
Mr. Durant to swoop in here
and free you?
He is your partner, right...
The one who runs things around here?
Hmm.
Yeah, I know men like him...
Big men. Keep you close...
Quit your yapping and get me a cup of water.
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.
Whew!
That should hold you till
Mr. Durant gets here.
Wallace?
It's a bad spot for a campfire.
Government took the casino.
Mickey's in jail.
I take it he didn't agree
with the change in ownership.
Just here to see my friend.
I figured you and me are square.
Uh-uh.
You come here to compare
bruises or bust me out?
The latter ain't up to me no more.
Yeah.
Mr. Durant's working on my release, so...
Wouldn't count on that.
Durant does what's best for Durant.
That's how I ended up with 40 acres
of worthless land in the North Valley.
Shit, son.
Come here.
When I met you...
You didn't have nothing but
some cheap painted glass
and stories of home.
And you turned that into
a whorehouse and a casino.
You can do that again.
Hell with Durant.
Without him, I got no leverage.
That is exactly what Sean thought.
Don't leave me to bury you similar.
Okay?
All aboard!
Yes, sir. How y'all doing?
Mickey's, uh, expecting
you to get him sprung.
Mickey needs to learn to curb his temper
if he wants to run a business.
Let me tell you something...
Casino's just the start of
what Campbell's fixing to take.
Pretty soon he'll come for it all.
Campbell is a bureaucrat, nothing more.
He's a carpetbagger.
First thing they did in the South,
rebuild the railroads.
Now, odds are,
he's got friends helped him do that,
men just itching to do it again.
Now, he knows that there's
money in it and power.
No carpetbagger will take my railroad.
Yeah.
That's what I thought about
a farm back in Mississippi.
Have you conquered Sherman Peak yet?
Working on it.
Get my railroad moving, Mr. Bohannon.
I'd like you to sit in front tomorrow.
And try not to tug at your shirt collar.
I don't want to go to hell.
Months of silence,
and that's what you have to say?
I doubt that's God's plan for you.
You're naughty sometimes, but that...
I'm mormon.
Where are your people?
It's all right.
We don't have to talk about this.
You're safe.
Mr. Durant.
Ah, Eva.
You know that stock you gave me last year?
- Mm-hmm.
- How much is it worth?
Virtually nothing at the moment.
I should go back to whoring.
If it's money you need, let me help.
Mr. Durant, I can't take
no charity from you.
Think of it as a loan.
No, I can't.
Church lady stopped by.
Yeah, and... I'm sorry. What?
The church lady.
She invited us to services tomorrow.
And, uh...
You don't want to go?
She doesn't like mormons.
I doubt she's met many before you,
but, uh...
Ruth speaks her mind,
but she's a good woman,
and she can help you make your way here.
That's my husband's job.
I'm providing for you and William.
Father provided for all of
his wives and his children,
but he still ate with us,
worshipped with us.
Much like the life that you
had with your first wife...
But you left all of that behind.
There was a war.
War's over.
Get back inside.
Go on.
You know, you...
you did right by me with this marriage.
I’m grateful, I am.
I guess, uh…
I should have known that… family life wasn’t for you.
Start with the people Campbell
worked with in Atlanta.
See if any of them were railroad men.
Oh, and find out what involvement he had
in the reconstruction of
the railroads after the war.
You do know I have an engineering degree.
Then you should have the intelligence
to be able to send a few telegrams.
That will be all, Delaney.
Ah, Eva!
You came around.
I'll take your money, Mr. Durant...
For a poke.
No, you misunderstand!
No, I... that was not
a condition of my offer.
Look, I know I
ain't so pretty right now,
but I clean up good.
No!
Eva, you're beautiful.
Well, then why not take a ride?
It's no trouble.
Don't mean nothing to me no mores, anyway.
That, my dear, is a tragedy.
I like you.
And I know you like me.
So?
Come on.
I'll give you a good price.
Listen to me.
You will take my money.
You are going to eat my food.
And then you are going to get into my bath,
because, truth be told,
you are beginning to smell
a little ripe.
I...
I can't.
You can, and you will.
You are one of the few
people I like around here.
I'll pay you for that.
You all right in there?
Yep.
You can come in, if you like.
- No, I-I'm fine.
-
Why are you doing this?
Don't make no sense.
Because we're friends.
I ain't never had no
friends weren't customers.
Their loss.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.
Do you think all women are whores?
Why would you say that?
Well...
Last time I was in a bath,
a man made clear that opinion.
I consider women to be God's
most glorious creatures.
I was fortunate enough to love one.
Your wife?
No.
Well... well...
At one time, maybe.
But after our boy died, we...
Well, we were business partners at best.
When I was in jail,
penniless,
she left me.
Oh.
Her loss.
Thank you.
Don't make the love stop.
Does it get any easier?
No.
Indeed, no, it does not.
You didn't come to bed.
Well, I had work to do,
and I figured you didn't want me there.
Of course I do.
It's been a long time since I had a family
other than the railroad.
So I figured we could go
to church this morning...
Together, if you're willing.
I'd like that.
I got to take care of something
before service, all right?
Run, Henry, run, yeah
run, Nathan, run, oh, run,
Leroy, run, I tell ya
All:  you got a right to the tree of life
all God's children got a right
you got a right to the tree of life
oh, children, you got a right
All:  you got a right to the tree of life
Hebrew children got a right
All:  you got a right to the tree of life
I've come to tell you,
you got a right
All:  you got a right to the tree of life
run, Bohannon, run, I say
you got a right to the tree of life
run, Bohannon, run, I tell ya
you got a right to the tree of life
all God's children got a right
you got a right to the tree of life
Amen. All right.
- Psalms.
- How you doing this morning?
Morning.
So let me ask you something.
How much to get a crew together today?
How much you got?
No.
Can't get more than ten men for that,
two hours, most.
All right, meet you at
the grade after church.
Oh, boys been hankering
for a game of baseball
this afternoon.
You want a crew, got to go now.
Um...
All right, pick the crew.
Fellas...
I know it's the Lord's day,
but we're gonna work.
Durant came by to see me yesterday.
He asked for your release.
I told him no.
I have a proposition that
could free you today.
Sign this paper giving
me title to the casino.
I'll pay you to manage the place.
Granted, I could just steal
the property from you.
You already have.
I prefer to do things legally.
$200 for the title...
Salary for you.
Jessup will pick up the tax every week.
Shove your money up your arse.
Come now, Mr. McGinnes.
You're a smart man.
Aye. And a comer too.
I came to this country with nothing,
and I built me a fortune.
I'll do it again...
Beholden not to the likes of you
or to Thomas C. Durant.
We damn sure can't blast
through this mountain.
Durant's given up on going around.
Got no choice but over.
That beating you took
done scrambled your brain.
Surveyors done been all over this mountain,
ain't found nowhere that wasn't too steep.
Yeah, I looked at the notes.
There was 6 foot of snow on the ground
when they was out here.
Now, I was up top yesterday,
saw a way might work.
"Might"?
If we carve a ledge the
width of a train track
on the mountain's outer edge.
All right, look...
- See that cliff over yonder?
- Yeah.
We gonna dig a 2% grade straight for it.
When I know how far we can get in two hours,
I can figure how long it'll take
a full crew to reach the summit.
Could be Durant ain't have us try this
'cause he know it's crazy.
Well, only one way to find out.
Did it come?
This is from Bishop Finch.
It says Bishop Dutson is 5 feet,
brown hair,
portly girth.
Stand up.
You are not the man
described in this telegram.
No.
You have deceived this entire community.
Tell me who you are!
I am...
Bishop Joseph Dutson,
and I have never met Bishop Finch.
You prayed beside him
for three years.
This proves
that you have borne
false witness to us all.
It proves only that the author has lied
to support your delusion.
Or perhaps you are the author,
brother Hatch.
I am bringing this to the elders.
Mm-hmm.
They will find you guilty
and set you to the noose.
Are you sure they have the authority
to hang a Bishop?
Because if they do not
and you are wrong,
then you will hang, brother Hatch,
as will the elders.
Who has the authority, if not the elders?
An unimpeachable man...
The lion of the Lord...
Our brother Brigham Young.
Bring him here.
I will abide by his judgment.
Hmm.
These tools all wrong.
This ain't gonna work.
Thank you for helping me consecrate
this fine house of worship.
Brothers and sisters,
Jesus Christ is alive
and present in this building.
And if we do not accept him as
our personal Lord and savior,
we will burn in hell.
All: Amen.
I speak not of the innocents among us.
The Lord said,
"Suffer the children to come unto me.
The kingdom of heaven
belongs to such as these."
No, it is those who turn away
from the teachings of the Lord
who will spend eternity in the fiery lake.
For he commands us to love our God,
as well as our neighbor.
Do you love your God?
All: Yes.
Do you love your neighbor?
All: Yes.
I did not love my neighbor this week.
I sat in judgment on my fellow man.
I reveled in the pit
of my own self-righteousness.
So I deserve to be cast out into darkness,
and I do not deserve salvation.
None of us does.
Only the blessed mercy
of Jesus Christ can save us.
Hey, little man.
I went to church.
- Naomi...
- I know.
I'll stop asking.
