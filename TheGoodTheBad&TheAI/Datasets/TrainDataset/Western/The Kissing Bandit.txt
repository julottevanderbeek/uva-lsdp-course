"DEAR CHICO,
"MY FATHER'S
OLD FRIEND.
"HOW NICE OF YOU
TO INVITE ME
"TO COME OUT
TO CALIFORNIA--
"THE HOME OF
MY CHILDHOOD.
"I AM SORRY TO HEAR
THAT BUSINESS
HAS BEEN BAD,
"BUT PLEASE STOP
WORRYING.
"I KNOW THAT
I CAN HELP YOU.
"THERE IS A SCHOOL
RIGHT HERE IN BOSTON
"THAT TEACHES NOTHING
BUT HOW TO MANAGE
"A BUSINESS
LIKE FATHER'S.
"FOR YEARS, I HAVE
BEEN STUDYING.
"I AM LEAVING
AT ONCE TO JOIN YOU.
"TOGETHER WE WILL
RUN THE BUSINESS
"AND TURN IT INTO
A GREAT SUCCESS.
EVER YOURS,
RICARDO."
YOU HEAR THAT?
IN BOSTON,
THEY TEACH YOU HOW
TO BE A BANDIT.
YOU CAN LEARN IT
IN A SCHOOL! HA HA!
WELL, WE'RE BACK
IN BUSINESS AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO BE
BANDITS ONCE MORE.
WE'LL RIDE AND ROB
AND BE RICH AND FAMOUS.
HA! FERNANDO,
MY HORSE.
GET MY HORSE QUICK.
I GOT TO TELL THE MEN.
COME ON!
HEY!
AIEEE!
HEY!
ESTEBAN!
HI OH!
COME ON!
Chico: AMIGOS!
COME HERE, AMIGOS.
LOOK WHAT I HAVE
BEEN KEEPING FOR
OUR NEW CHIEF.
A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
OF HIS FATHER--
A REAL LIKENESS.
All: OHHHH.
HOW PROUD
HIS SON WILL BE.
AND WHY NOT?
IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
OF CALIFORNIA,
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN
SUCH A REWARD FOR
A BANDIT. NEVER!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
OFFERING FOR THE HEAD OF
DIRTY DANILO?
NO.
AND THAT'S
TOO MUCH.
SURE, IT'S
TOO MUCH.
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO HANG HIM?
PLEASE, LET US
NOT USE THAT WORD.
THE BOY WILL BE
JUST LIKE HIM.
WAIT AND SEE.
CHICO!
CHICO, LOOK!
RICARDO'S ARRIVING!
AH, HE RIDES
LIKE THE DEVIL!
HA HA!
Man: WHOO HOO!
HOW HE RIDES...
JUST LIKE HIS FATHER.
AY, WHAT A LEADER
HE WILL MAKE!
COME, EVERYONE!
LET US GREET HIM.
Chico: MANUEL,
BRING THE MUSIC.
GO ON!
Man: HURRY UP!
EVERYBODY, COME ON!
LET US GIVE HIM
THE WELCOME OF A HERO.
COME ON, EVERYBODY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
I--I--I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I HAVEN'T OWNED THE HORSE
VERY LONG AND I--
AND, UH, I'M TERRIBLY
SORRY THAT I MESSED UP
THE FURNITURE.
THIS IS
A VERY NICE PLACE
YOU'VE GOT HERE.
YES.
WHO IS THAT?
THAT IS
THE KISSING BANDIT!
THE KISSING BANDIT?
YOUR FATHER.
THAT'S MY FATHER,
THE KISSING--
MY FATHER
THE KISSING...
B-BANDIT?
OF COURSE!
OHH.
WHERE--WHERE AM I?
WHAT HAPPENED?
LITTLE ONE, YOU FAINTED.
I FAINTED?
NO, NO. DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY, RICARDO.
I AM CHICO,
YOUR OLD FRIEND.
REMEMBER?
OH, YEAH.
HELLO.
CHICO! WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT MY FATHER--
HE DID OWN THE INN,
DIDN'T HE?
HE WAS AN INNKEEPER,
WASN'T HE?
SHH, SHH, SHH.
DIDN'T YOU EVER HEAR
ABOUT HIM DOING
SOMETHING ELSE?
OH.
YES, I--I HEARD HE HAD
A LITTLE SIDELINE.
MM-HMM.
YOU MEAN...
THE LITTLE SIDELINE
WAS BEING A B-BANDIT?
NO. THE LITTLE SIDELINE
WAS BEING AN INNKEEPER.
THE MAIN THING WAS
BEING A BANDIT.
OH, MY.
OH, ME.
SON OF A BANDIT.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
BUT YOU'RE NOT A SON
OF JUST A BANDIT.
YOU'RE THE SON OF
THE KISSING BANDIT--
THE GREATEST BANDIT
IN ALL CALIFORNIA.
BIG THING.
TELL ME, WHEN YOU
ANSWERED MY LETTER,
WHEN YOU SAID YOU
WANTED TO TAKE YOUR
FATHER'S PLACE,
YOU MEANT YOU WANTED
TO BE AN INNKEEPER?
OF COURSE.
CHICO,
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE HOTEL BUSINESS.
I'VE STUDIED. LOOK.
I BROUGHT
MY COOKBOOKS
AND PLANS
TO MAKE THIS
THE FINEST HOTEL
IN ALL CALIFORNIA.
I--HOT WATER
IN EVERY ROOM,
CLEAN SHEETS
ON EVERY BED,
AND--AND--
AND WINDOW BOXES.
WINDOW BOXES IN EVERY WINDOW
WITH PRETTY FLOWERS, AND...
OH.
CHICO...
YOU MEAN, WHEN YOU
SENT FOR ME TO TAKE
MY FATHER'S PLACE,
YOU THOUGHT I WOULD
BE THE BANDIT CHIEF?
OF COURSE.
OH, NO.
NO, NO. NO.
BUT--BUT LISTEN,
RICARDO.
NO.
EVER SINCE
YOUR FATHER DIED,
I KEPT HIS MEN
TOGETHER.
THEY HAD OFFERS,
GOOD OFFERS,
FROM OTHER CHIEFS--
FROM DIRTY DANILO,
ONE-EYED LOUIE--
BUT I NEVER LET THEM
TAKE THE OFFERS.
"NO," I SAID.
"WE WILL WAIT
FOR THE SON OF
OUR CHIEF.
"HE WILL BE A GREAT
LEADER," I SAID,
"JUST LIKE
HIS FATHER."
A-AND YOU GOTTA BE.
YOU GOTTA BE
AND YOU GONNA BE.
UH, NO, NO, CHICO.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I COULDN'T LEAD
ANY MEN.
I COULDN'T LEAD ANYBODY.
UH, LOOK.
LOOK AT ME.
IF I HELD YOU UP,
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
YOUR MONEY?
WELL...WELL,
YOUR FATHER DIDN'T
LOOK TOO GOOD
WHEN HE FIRST
STARTED, EITHER.
WAIT.
BUT, CHICO,
I CAN'T EVEN RIDE.
YOU SAW ME FALL OFF
THAT--THAT HORSE.
WELL, EVERYONE CAN
HAVE AN ACCIDENT.
THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT.
I'VE BEEN FALLING OFF
THAT HORSE EVER SINCE
I GOT HIM.
I--I'M AFRAID OF HIM.
I'M AFRAID OF FIGHTS AND--
AND LOUD NOISES AND--
WELL, I'M PRACTICALLY
AFRAID OF EVERYTHING.
NEARLY EVERYBODY
IS AFRAID OF
NEARLY EVERYTHING.
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS NOT TO SHOW IT.
HA HA!
YEAH, THAT WAS
YOUR FATHER'S.
AW, IT'S NO USE,
CHICO.
WAIT, WAIT.
HERE.
YOUR FATHER'S
SOMBRERO.
OH, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.
AY, WHAT
A DIFFERENCE.
ALREADY YOU LOOK
TWICE AS BIG.
SURE. LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE GLASS.
GO ON, LOOK.
OH, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.
IF I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU,
I WOULD THINK IT WAS HIM.
YOU WERE BORN
TO BE A BANDIT.
YOU KNOW,
I READ A LOT OF BOOKS
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY
ABOUT BANDITS
LIKE ROBIN HOOD
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
MUST BE A RATHER
EXCITING LIFE.
AHA!
YOU READ BOOKS
ABOUT THE BANDITS?
THEN YOU KNOW
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.
AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW,
I WILL SHOW YOU.
YOU GONNA BE RICH AND FAMOUS
LIKE YOUR FATHER.
THEN I WILL BE HAPPY,
THE MEN WILL BE HAPPY,
AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW
THE KISSING BANDIT
IS RIDING AGAIN.
UH-HUH.
CHICO, WHY DID
THEY CALL MY FATHER
THE KISSING BANDIT?
OH, EVERY BANDIT CHIEF
GOT A TRADEMARK.
AFTER EVERY ROBBERY,
YOUR FATHER USED
TO KISS THE WOMEN,
LIKE YOU GONNA DO.
HEH HEH!
THAT WAS HIS TRADEMARK.
YOU MEAN HE KISSED WOMEN
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW?
SURE.
WOMEN HE WASN'T
INTRODUCED TO?
OH, BUT YOU
GONNA LIKE IT.
OH, NO, I WON'T.
WHY, IN BOSTON,
YOU DON'T EVEN KISS
WOMEN YOU DO KNOW--
NOT UNTIL YOU'RE
ENGAGED TO THEM.
AH, BUT WAIT.
KISSING IS THE BEST
PART OF THE JOB,
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA,
ALL THE WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL.
WE GOT NOTHING BUT
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
Woman: TERESA,
THE CARRIAGE
IS WAITING,
AND YOUR AUNT IS
GETTING NERVOUS.
OH, THANK YOU, SISTER.
TERESA,
ARE YOU SAD ABOUT
LEAVING THE SCHOOL?
HMM.
WELL,
ARE YOU HAPPY?
MM-HMM.
Girl: NO MORE
STUDYING ONCE
YOU'RE HOME.
AND NO MORE
CLASSES.
AND YOU WON'T GET
TO PLAY WITH US
AND SING FOR US
OR ANYTHING, ANYMORE.
Girl: WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?
YOU'RE FINISHING
EVERYTHING
TODAY.
OH, NO. MY LIFE
BEGINS TOMORROW.
IT'S TRUE THERE
WON'T BE CLASSES
OR LESSONS,
BUT THERE'LL BE
NEW THINGS--
THINGS LIKE--
LIKE ROMANCE.
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT'S SOMETHING I DON'T
EVEN KNOW ABOUT...YET.
^^ THEY SAY
ROMANCE IS SWEET ^^
^^ MY DREAMS
HAVE TOLD ME SO ^^
^^ THOUGH LOVE AND I
HAVE YET TO MEET ^^
^^ TOMORROW
I SHOULD KNOW ^^
^^ TOMORROW MEANS
ROMANCE FOR ME ^^
^^ FOR MY LOVER
WILL APPEAR ^^
^^ THERE'S A MEANING
TO ROMANCE FOR ME ^^
^^ WHEN I SEE
MY CAVALIER ^^
^^ HE MAY BE A DREAM
THAT SINGS TO ME ^^
^^ OR A SHEPHERD
IN DISGUISE ^^
^^ OR AN ANGEL
MORNING BRINGS TO ME ^^
^^ WITH A DEVIL IN HIS EYES ^^
^^ OH, I KNOW THAT
SWEET TOMORROW ^^
^^ WILL BE DIFFERENT
FROM TODAY ^^
^^ FOR THE LOVE
I MEET TOMORROW ^^
^^ WILL TAKE MY HEART AWAY ^^
^^ THOUGH NO GYPSY TOLD ME
FOOLISH THINGS ^^
^^ STILL, MY WALK
BECOMES A DANCE ^^
^^ AND MY HEART
WITH ALL ITS MUSIC SINGS ^^
^^ FOR TOMORROW BRINGS
ROMANCE ^^
IT IS GOOD IDEA,
CHICO,
PUTTING HIM UP THERE
OUT OF THE WAY.
AY, IT'S GOOD.
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE WOULD GIVE IN
SO EASY.
WELL, IT'S WHAT HE
THINKS A BANDIT CHIEF
SHOULD LOOK LIKE--
A MAN ON A WHITE HORSE
WAY UP IN THE CLOUDS...
WHERE HE'S NICE AND SAFE.
I TOLD HIM
WHEN THE COACH STOPS,
TO COME DOWN
THE BACK WAY.
THAT WILL TAKE
A LONG TIME.
BY THEN
THE HOLDUP IS FINISHED,
SO HE CAN KISS THE WOMEN
WHO ARE AROUND.
IT'S A NICE, GOOD PLAN.
YOU TOLD HIM HE'S
GOT TO KISS, EH?
OH, I MADE HIM SWEAR.
HEY, CHICO,
LOOK, LOOK.
HE'S WAVING
HIS ARMS.
CHICO! CHICO!
THE COACH.
THE COACH!
ALL RIGHT, AMIGOS--
BUSINESS!
OH, HO!
IT'S WONDERFUL.
OUR FIRST HOLDUP
IN A LONG TIME.
HOW HE WAVED HIS ARM!
WHAT ENTHUSIASM!
HEY!
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
A HOLDUP BY
THE KISSING BANDIT.
THE KISSING BANDIT?
SINCE WHEN IS HE
RIDING AGAIN?
SINCE NOW.
GET THE TRUNKS OFF.
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.
I'M COLONEL GOMEZ OF
THE GOVERNOR'S OWN GUARD.
NO, COLONEL, I WOULDN'T.
YOU'RE ALREADY SURROUNDED.
YEAH, I GUESS
I AM, ALL RIGHT.
BUT, SIR, I'M JUST ESCORTING
THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
BACK HOME TO THE GOVERNOR.
WE HAVE NO MONEY.
MAYBE YOU FORGOT
SOMETHING.
I'LL HAVE A LOOK.
GET HIM OFF
THE HORSE.
NO, PLEASE, SIR.
THE GOVERNOR WON'T
LIKE THIS AT ALL.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
THE GOVERNOR
WON'T LIKE
THIS AT ALL.
WHO ARE YOU,
YOU UGLY MAN?
I HAVE THE HONOR
TO BE ONE OF THE MEN
OF THE KISSING BANDIT.
THE KISSING BANDIT?!
THE KISSING BANDIT?!
Chico: UH-HUH.
THAT'S HIM UP THERE.
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID.
WE DON'T HARM THE WOMEN.
OH, I'M NOT
AFRAID OF YOU.
OH, AND I'M NOT AFRAID
OF YOU, NEITHER.
BUT THIS ONE...
THIS ONE SCARES ME
A LITTLE.
HEH HEH HEH!
THE BEAST.
TERESA, STAY AWAY
FROM THAT WINDOW.
OH, AUNT ISABELLA, LOOK.
ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE WAY
A MAN OUGHT TO LOOK.
TERESA, I MUST
SPEAK TO YOU.
YOU'VE DOUBTLESS
HEARD WHAT HE DOES--
THE KISSING BANDIT--
TO WOMEN, I MEAN.
WELL,
HE KISSES THEM.
YES. WELL, IT MUSTN'T
HAPPEN TO YOU.
YOUR FATHER WOULD NEVER
LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE.
AND SO YOU'RE
TO STAY RIGHT HERE,
AND I WILL GET OUT.
BUT WHAT GOOD
WILL THAT DO?
WHY, HE'LL
KISS ME INSTEAD.
IT'S A SACRIFICE
I'M WILLING TO MAKE FOR
THE HONOR OF OUR FAMILY.
Chico: COME ON, GET OUT.
OVER THERE, PLEASE.
GONZALEZ,
OUR MOMENT HAS COME.
NO, RICARDO, PLEASE!
GO BACK!
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY!
AIEEEE!
AIEEE!
AAAAAAAH!
HELLO.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.
DON'T--
DON'T BE AFRAID.
STOP THIS COACH
IMMEDIATELY!
EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT NOW.
I'M AWFULLY SORRY.
WE ALMOST HAD
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.
OH...YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
OH, NO, PLEASE, SENOR.
I'D RATHER YOU WOULDN'T.
I'D RATHER EXTEND MY--
MY THANKS FROM WHERE I AM
TO--TO WHERE YOU ARE.
DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?
YES. YOU'RE A BANDIT.
NOT JUST A BANDIT.
THE KISSING BANDIT.
WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOTHING. I...
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
A NICE TRIP?
IT'S WONDERFUL WEATHER
FOR A TRIP.
CERTAINLY I'M NOT HAVING
A NICE TRIP.
DO YOU THINK I ENJOY
MEETING A MAN LIKE YOU?
I'M HAVING
A TERRIBLE TRIP.
OH, YES. I SUPPOSE
I DID INTERRUPT
YOUR JOURNEY.
I'M AWFULLY SORRY.
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
FUN OF ME THIS WAY?
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO HORRIBLE?
I'M NOT MAKING
FUN OF YOU.
OH, YOU'RE NOT?
STANDING HERE MAKING
CONVERSATION ABOUT
THE WEATHER
WHEN ALL THE TIME
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO...
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO KISS ME,
AND IF YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO BE AS--
AS UNDIGNIFIED AS TO
STRUGGLE WITH YOU,
YOU'RE WRONG.
NO, I--I'M NOT
GOING TO KISS YOU.
YOU'RE NOT?
I COULDN'T.
LOOK, HERE COME MY MEN.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
LITTLE ONE?
YES,
I'M FINE.
WHEN YOU KISSED HER,
DID SHE FAINT?
UH, NO.
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME.
COME ON. WE GOT TO
GET AWAY FROM HERE.
BUT WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HER HERE.
Chico: PEDRO,
GET THE SENORITA'S
PARTY TOGETHER
AND SEND THEM
ON THEIR WAY.
COME ON.
GET ON YOUR HORSE.
GONZALEZ, HONESTLY,
SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU'RE NOT DEPENDABLE.
Chico: HURRY,
RICARDO. HURRY.
Ricardo: YES, CHICO.
I'M COMING.
WELL, CHIEF, REMEMBER
WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN? HEH HEH!
I THINK I'M GOING TO
LIKE BEING A BANDIT.
YOU GONNA BE GREAT.
COME ON, LITTLE ONE.
JOSE, SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED.
OUR COACH WAS HELD UP
BY THE KISSING BANDIT.
KISSING BANDIT?
IS HE BACK?
TERESA. I MUST--
SHE'S SAFE.
BUT, JOSE, THERE
ARE THINGS I MUST
TELL YOU FIRST.
GENTLEMEN,
LEAVE US.
NOW...
I SAID,
LEAVE US.
NOW, ISABELLA,
TELL ME.
JOSE, EVER SINCE
THE HOLDUP,
THERE'S BEEN
AN EXPRESSION
ON TERESA'S FACE--
A SORT OF
SECRET EXPRESSION.
NEVER MIND
THE EXPRESSION
ON HER FACE.
TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED BECAUSE
I WASN'T THERE.
THEY WERE ALONE.
YOU WEREN'T
THERE?
NOW, IF YOU ADD THAT
TO THE EXPRESSION
ON HER FACE...
OH, ME.
Teresa: FATHER.
COME INSIDE,
DARLING.
COME INSIDE
WITH PAPA.
NO. NOT YOU.
IF THERE EVER WAS
A TIME WHEN A NIECE
NEEDED HER AUNT...
NOW, LOOK. WHEN YOU
WERE A LITTLE GIRL,
YOU BROUGHT ALL YOUR
LITTLE TROUBLES TO ME.
REMEMBER?
NOW THAT YOU
ARE A BIG GIRL,
I WANT YOU TO FEEL
THAT YOU CAN
BRING ALL YOUR
BIG TROUBLES TO ME.
YES, FATHER.
YES. WELL...
NOW, WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE BOY IN SPAIN,
THEY USED TO TELL
A STORY ABOUT FLOWERS
AND BIRDS AND...
BEES. UH...
UH, ALL THAT
SORT OF THING,
YOU KNOW.
BUT OUT HERE
IN CALIFORNIA,
THEY HAVE SUCH, UH,
SUCH BIG FLOWERS
AND SUCH GIANT
EAGLES THAT--
FATHER, IS IT
THE KISSING BANDIT?
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT?
WAIT A MINUTE,
DARLING.
LET'S NOT RUSH
INTO THIS TOO FAST.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
OH.
NOW, TELL IT TO PAPA
IN YOUR OWN WAY,
RIGHT FROM
THE BEGINNING.
WELL, WHEN I FIRST
SAW HIM ON HORSEBACK,
HE LOOKED MAGNIFICENT.
AND THEN I SAW HIM
CLOSE UP WITHOUT HIS MASK,
AND HE LOOKED VERY NICE, TOO.
YOU KNOW, FATHER,
THERE'S SOMETHING WONDERFUL
ABOUT A MAN BEING A BANDIT.
TERESA, DARLING,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS,
UH, WHEN HE KISSED YOU--
HE, UH...
WHEN HE KISSED ME?
HE IS
THE KISSING BANDIT.
HE KISSES
EVERY GIRL HE SEES.
I ASK YOU, WOULD IT
BE REASONABLE FOR HIM
NOT TO KISS YOU?
NO. NO, IT WOULDN'T,
WOULD IT?
OF COURSE NOT.
NOW TELL PAPA
WHAT HAPPENED.
WELL, WE--WE TALKED.
WHAT DID YOU TALK
ABOUT, DARLING?
UM...CONVERSATION,
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL?
MM-HMM.
AH. FINE, FINE.
SPLENDID!
FATHER, YOU SEEM QUITE
PLEASED ABOUT ALL THIS.
PLEASED?
OF COURSE
I'M PLEASED.
THIS TIME,
WE WILL
CATCH HIM.
AT LAST, AFTER
ALL THESE WOMEN
HE HAS KISSED,
THERE IS ONE WHO
WILL IDENTIFY HIM.
GOMEZ!
I PROMISE YOU,
DARLING,
HE WILL NOT ONLY BE CAUGHT.
HE WILL BE HUNG!
GOMEZ!
TAKE DOWN
THIS DESCRIPTION.
GO AHEAD,
DARLING.
UH, WELL, UM...
HE--HE WAS LARGE
AND--AND FAT.
UM, IN FACT,
HE WAS HUGE.
AND HE--HE WAS
VERY OLD AND HAD
LITTLE PIGGY EYES.
Governor:
LITTLE PIGGY EYES?
BUT YOU SAID
HE WAS NICE-LOOKING.
DID I? WELL, UH...
IT ISN'T AS THOUGH
I SAW HIS FACE,
YOU SEE.
UH, HE WORE A MASK.
BUT YOU SAID
HE DIDN'T WEAR A MASK.
OH, WELL,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.
I'M TIRED AND UPSET,
AND YOU KEEP ME HERE
ANSWERING THESE
SILLY QUESTIONS.
OH, TERESA,
FORGIVE ME.
GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND REST,
AND YOU ARE NOT TO THINK
ANY MORE ABOUT A KISSING BANDIT.
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.
AFTER ALL, THE MAN
KISSES EVERY WOMAN
HE SEES.
HE KISSES
EVERY WOMAN HE SEES.
AND NOW, MAJOR GOMEZ,
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU.
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
BUT YOU'RE CALLING ME
MAJOR GOMEZ
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS
I'M COLONEL GOMEZ.
OH, NO.
NOT ANYMORE.
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
THIS AFTERNOON.
YOU ARE DEMOTED.
WHY?
BECAUSE YOU ARE IN
TERRIBLE TROUBLE.
AM I?
MM-HMM.
A NEW TAX COLLECTOR IS
ON HIS WAY FROM SPAIN.
HE'LL BE HERE
ANY DAY NOW.
BUT WE NEVER HAD
ANY TROUBLE WITH
TAX COLLECTORS.
THEY COME FOR THE TAXES,
THEY DON'T GET THEM,
THEY GO BACK TO SPAIN.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
YES, BUT THIS TIME
THE KING HAS SENT
HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN
COUNT BELMONTE,
AND COUNT BELMONTE'S ORDERS
ARE TO BRING BACK
EITHER THE TAX MONEY
OR MY HEAD.
BUT, GOVERNOR,
IF IT'S THE TAX
MONEY OR YOUR HEAD,
HOW AM I IN TROUBLE?
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T BE
VERY SORRY, OF COURSE.
YOU'LL BE SORRY BECAUSE
WITH COUNT BELMONTE IS
A CERTAIN GENERAL TORRO
WHO IS THE HEAD
OF HIS MAJESTY'S
SECRET POLICE.
AND GENERAL TORRO IS
COMING HERE TO SEE
HOW MUCH LAW AND ORDER
THERE IS IN CALIFORNIA.
AND THERE ISN'T ANY--
NO LAW, NO ORDER,
JUST PLENTY OF BANDITS.
THAT'S PRETTY
TERRIBLE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
GENERAL TORRO IS
GOING TO WITH YOU
IF HE GETS HERE
BEFORE YOU CAPTURE
THE KISSING BANDIT?
HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO SPAIN
AND PUT YOU IN A LITTLE,
DARK DUNGEON...
WITH RATS.
THEN ONE DAY A MAN
WITH A BLACK HOOD
OVER HIS HEAD
BUT WE NEVER HAD
ANY TROUBLE WITH
TAX COLLECTORS.
IS GOING TO COME IN
TO GARROTE YOU.
YOU KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS?
NO.
TO CHOKE YOU
TILL YOU ARE DEAD.
NO. NO!
YES. YES!
EXCUSE ME. I THINK
I'D BETTER GO ALONG NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE OF IT.
WELL, JOSE?
IS THE CHILD
ALL RIGHT?
DID SHE TELL YOU
EVERYTHING?
OF COURSE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
OF COURSE
SHE TOLD ME
EVERYTHING.
GENTLEMEN,
I SUGGEST YOU
CONCERN YOURSELVES
A LITTLE MORE
WITH THE PROBLEM
OF THE TAX MONEY
AND A LITTLE LESS
WITH MY DAUGHTER.
JUANITA, WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?
OH, SENORITA TERESA,
FORGIVE ME,
BUT I'M SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.
I JUST HEARD ABOUT
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE.
THE WHOLE HACIENDA'S
BUZZING WITH IT.
MY GOOD FORTUNE?
WHY, THAT YOU WERE
KISSED, OF COURSE!
BY HIM!
OH, SENORITA, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MUST BE FEELING.
YOU SEE...
I, TOO, HAD THE HONOR.
YOU, TOO, HAD THE HONOR?
BUT I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
JUANITA, IS IT TRUE
ABOUT HIM?
DOES HE KISS
EVERYBODY?
THAT'S WHAT'S SO
WONDERFUL ABOUT HIM.
HE HAS TIME
FOR EVERYONE.
NO PREJUDICE.
NO ONE'S TOO YOUNG.
NO ONE'S TOO OLD.
TELL ME, SENORITA...
HOW LONG WERE YOU OUT?
OUT?
AFTER HE KISSED YOU.
WELL, I...
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, SENORITA TERESA,
FORGIVE ME.
I KNOW YOU MUST
WANT TO BE ALONE.
EVERYONE DOES AFTERWARD.
OH, THERE'S SO MUCH
TO THINK ABOUT.

WOULD ROBIN HOOD
HAVE ACTED THAT WAY?
OR ROMEO?
NO! THEY WOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED HER RIGHT TO
THE GOVERNOR'S HACIENDA.
THEY WOULD HAVE CLIMBED
THE BALCONY.
THAT'S WHAT
THEY WOULD HAVE DONE.
CLIMB...THE BALCONY!
GONZALEZ!
GONZALEZ, OVER HERE!

RICARDO!

AIEE! COME ON!
AIEE! AIEE! AIEE!
TERESA, DARLING,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHO WAS IT?
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW, FATHER.
I DIDN'T
SEE HIM.
I WAS SOUND ASLEEP,
AND THEN I HEARD
A LOT OF NOISE.
IT WAS
THE KISSING BANDIT.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
JOSE, HOW LONG
ARE YOU GOING TO LET
THIS MAN INSULT YOU?
BUT HE DIDN'T
INSULT FATHER!
I MEAN,
WELL, IF IT WAS
THE KISSING BANDIT,
IT WAS ME
HE WAS SINGING TO.
FOR THAT MAN
TO DARE
TO SERENADE
THE GOVERNOR'S
DAUGHTER...
MMM...WHAT
I WOULD LIKE
TO DO TO HIM.
IF I'M EVER
IN A ROOM
WITH HIM,
I'LL SPIT RIGHT
IN HIS LITTLE
PIGGY EYES.
I WILL JUST TEAR HIM
TO PIECES LIKE...
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU, IDIOT?
YOU IMBECILE!
ARE YOU CALLING ME,
YOUR EXCELLENCY?
YES, I'M CALLING YOU,
CAPTAIN GOMEZ.
GET ON YOUR HORSE.
GET YOUR MEN.
FOLLOW HIM!
HE'S THE KISSING BANDIT!
DO YOU HEAR ME,
CAPTAIN GOMEZ?
UH, YES,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
AYE AYE, SIR.
CAPTAIN GOMEZ?
YES. CAPTAIN GOMEZ.
Chico: OF ALL
THE FOOLISH THINGS TO DO.
TAKE A CHANCE
TO SPOIL EVERYTHING...
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU WAS GOING TO DO BETTER.
YOU TRAITOR, YOU!
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD
TO GONZALEZ.
HE KNEW IT WASN'T SMART
TO GO TO THE HACIENDA
OR TO STAY THERE, EVEN.
WELL, WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH IT?
A LOT OF PEOPLE
SERENADE GIRLS
ON THEIR BALCONIES
ALL THE TIME.
BUT NOT
THE GOVERNOR'S BALCONY
AND NOT THE GOVERNOR'S
DAUGHTER.
BUT, CHICO, SHE'S
SO LOVELY, I HAD
TO SEE HER AGAIN.
IN YOUR BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T SEE ANYBODY AGAIN.
YOU KISS AND VAMOOSE.
THAT'S ALL.
I DON'T SEE WHY.
MANY OUTLAWS
HAD STEADY GIRLS.
LOOK AT ROBIN HOOD
AND MAID MARIAN.
NO, YOU LOOK, RICARDO.
THERE ARE HUNDREDS
OF GIRLS IN CALIFORNIA,
BUT ONLY ONE
GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER.
AND THIS ONE
IS NOT FOR YOU.
YOU FOUND THAT
OUT TONIGHT.
SHE CAME OUT
ON THE BALCONY.
SURE, SURE.
BUT THEY WEREN'T
SHOOTING WATER
FROM THOSE GUNS.
LITTLE ONE, I LOVE YOU
LIKE YOU WERE MY OWN SON.
THIS YOU KNOW.
BUT IF I HEAR ONE MORE
WORD ABOUT THIS GIRL,
I'M FINISHED WITH YOU.
THIS I MEAN.
PSST! PSST! BULA!
WHERE IS BIANCA?
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.
INSIDE.
KEEP RICARDO THERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
THEN SEND HIM
OVER TO ME.
ALL RIGHT, CHICO.
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, LITTLE ONE.
CHICO, UH, I'M SORRY
I WORRIED YOU.
NAH, NAH, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S ALL FORGOTTEN.
NOW, SIT DOWN.
I GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE FOR YOU
THAT WILL TAKE
ALL THE FOOLISHNESS
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.
WAIT.
^^ I LIKE YOU ^^
^^ IF YOU LIKE ME ^^
^^ MMM ^^
GO TO WORK.
^^ I LIKE YOU ^^
^^ IF YOU LIKE ME ^^
^^ MMM ^^
^^ SOON THE MOON
WILL RISE ^^
^^ THERE'LL BE
STARS DIVINE ^^
^^ IF YOU ARE THERE ^^
^^ YOU'LL BE MINE ^^
^^ I LIKE YOU ^^
^^ IF YOU LIKE ME ^^
^^ MMM ^^
^^ MMM ^^
^^ MMM ^^
THAT WAS
BEAUTIFUL, MISS.
A WONDERFUL DANCE.
THANK YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
UH, I'VE GOT TO PUT
THIS IN SOME WATER.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE IS RICARDO?
HE HAD TO PUT A FLOWER
IN SOME WATER.
WHAT?
YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME.
PUT THAT GUN AWAY.
MAYBE THEY ARE GUESTS.
GET OUT.
ALL OF YOU,
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.
YOU'RE THE INNKEEPER?
WE DESIRE ROOMS.
WE GOT NO ROOMS.
NONSENSE. THIS IS
AN INN, ISN'T IT?
WE ARE ALL FULL UP.
PLEASE GO AWAY.
PEASANT, DO YOU KNOW
TO WHOM YOU ARE TALKING?
I'M COUNT BELMONTE
OF SPAIN,
OF HIS MAJESTY'S
ROYAL HOUSEHOLD.
AND THIS--THIS IS
MY AIDE GENERAL TORRO.
TORRO!
I DON'T FEEL
SO GOOD.
NOW, THEN, INNKEEPER,
SHOW US ROOMS AT ONCE.
Belmonte:
YOUR BEST ROOMS!
BUT, UH, PLEASE...
THERE IS A BETTER PLACE
UP THE ROAD ABOUT 17 MILES.
THEY GOT FINE ROOMS,
AND BIGGER ROOMS, AND, UH...
AND CLEAN TOWELS,
AND, UH...
AND...AND...
SHEETS, EVEN, AND...
BUT THEY WILL NOT DO FOR YOU
THE THINGS WE WILL DO.
WAIT WITH THAT
BEAUTIFUL CHEST.
DO NOT SCRATCH IT.
HERE, YOU ARE TIRED.
I WILL HELP YOU.
EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE FINE.
THIS ROOM HERE.
THE PEASANT CERTAINLY CHANGED
HIS MIND IN A HURRY.
TORRO!
TORRO!
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.
SNEEZE AND DRIBBLE,
YAWN AND SNORE...
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH A MAN!
HOW CAN YOU BE SO
MEAN WHEN I AM SO
SICK, BELMONTE?
PLEASE, CAN I
GO TO SLEEP?
GO UPSTAIRS.
FIND THE INNKEEPER.
HAVE HIM SHOW YOU
A ROOM, AND GO TO BED.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I
EVER HAVE A COLD BEFORE,
TILL I COME TO CALIFORNIA.
HELLO.
FETCH ME SOME WINE,
SOMETHING FIT TO DRINK.
WHY, YES, OF COURSE.
I'D BE GLAD TO.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
STARING AT ME?
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN
A GENTLEMAN BEFORE?
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH
BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES BEFORE.
THE WINE. THE WINE!
YES, OF COURSE.
THAT'S ONE OF
THE FINEST SWORDS
I'VE EVER SEEN.
IT MUST BE
A TOLEDO BLADE.
AND YOU HAVE THE LOOK
OF A MAN WHO KNOWS
HOW TO USE IT.
WELL, REALLY?
OH, YES.
I KNOW A MAN WHO'S HAD
ADVENTURE WHEN I SEE ONE.
MANY IS THE DUEL
YOU MUST HAVE FOUGHT
OVER SOME YOUNG MAID.
PEON! FLUNKY! HOW DARE
YOU SIT IN MY PRESENCE!
GET UP! GET UP BEFORE
I CUT YOUR HEART OUT!
WELL, YOU NEEDN'T BE
SO RUDE ABOUT IT.
I JUST WANTED TO
HAVE A LITTLE TALK.
AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T
GET ANGRY WHEN YOU ASKED
ME TO GET THE WINE.
GET THE INNKEEPER!
GET HIM DOWN HERE!
I'LL HAVE HIS HEART
AND YOURS!
MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT.
FINE CLOTHES DO NOT
MAKE THE GENTLEMAN.
GET THE INNKEEPER!
PEASANTS!
CHICO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Ricardo, do you
want to kill your
old friend? Shh!
You're not--you're not
stealing from them?
Of course!
But these men
are our guests.
We can't rob them
in cold blood.
Ricardo, I am a simple,
hard-working bandit.
If this is wrong,
why is it all right
to rob the coach?
When you rob a coach,
there's adventure.
There's danger.
Ah, but there's
danger here, too.
He might wake up,
the fat man,
and he's bigger
than me.
Chico, for my sake,
put the money back.
Oh, no, no.
Please, for me.
Let me help you.
But it's a shame.
We gotta have a long talk
on the question of ethics.
Believe me,
we gotta.
OH!
AIEE!
I THINK I SHALL
HAVE YOU HUNG
OUTSIDE THE INN
AS AN EXAMPLE TO
THE OTHER PEASANTS.
OH!
GET SOMETHING TO
TIE HIM WITH, QUICK!
BUT HE'S WINNING!
PLEASE, LITTLE ONE.
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.
TORRO! TORRO!
TORRO!
HOW DARE YOU?
Belmonte: HELP, TORRO! HELP!
TORRO! TORRO!
TORRO!
SHH!
TORRO, YOU FOOL,
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP--
WHAT IS THAT?
RICARDO,
SIT ON HIM.
EVERYBODY GOING, COMING,
GOING SOMEPLACE TONIGHT.
TIE A FEW MORE KNOTS IN HIM!
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD.
WE WEREN'T TAKING
THE MONEY.
WE WERE PUTTING
IT BACK.
ARE YOU THE INNKEEPER?
YES. YES.
I'M CAPTAIN GOMEZ OF
THE GOVERNOR'S GUARD.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
THE KISSING BANDIT.
HE'S A MAN WITH
LITTLE PIGGY EYES.
OH, LITTLE
PIGGY EYES?
WELL, HE'S
NOT HERE.
MY GOOD MAN, YOU
TAKE ME FOR A FOOL?
I'M GONNA SEARCH
EVERY ROOM OF THIS INN.
COVER EVERY
INCH OF GROUND.
I'LL TAKE UPSTAIRS.
WAIT, CAPTAIN,
PLEASE, I WOULDN'T,
BECAUSE WE GOT
TWO VERY IMPORTANT
GUESTS UPSTAIRS
JUST ARRIVED
FROM SPAIN--
A COUNT BELMONTE
AND A GENERAL TORRO.
I WOULDN'T BOTHER
THEM BECAUSE
THEY'RE ALL TIED UP
RIGHT NOW.
NONSENSE. NONSENSE.
COUNT BELMONTE?
GENERAL TORRO?!
MEN! MEN!
MEN, NEW ORDER!
BACK TO THE HACIENDA.
WE'VE GOT TO TELL
THE GOVERNOR.
COME ON, MEN.
FOLLOW ME!
ALL TIED UP. I TOLD THEM
THEY WERE ALL TIED UP.
THEY DON'T KNOW THE JOKE.
I WONDER WHY THAT
GOMEZ WAS SO SCARED
OF THESE TWO, HUH?
THERE MUST BE
A REASON.
AHCHOO!
WHAT IS THE MATTER?
I HAVE
THE FUNNIEST DREAM.
I DREAMED THAT 3 MEN
WAS FIGHTING, AND THEY
TIE ME UP WITH THE ROPE.
AND...
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
I'M STILL DREAMING?
GO TO SLEEP.
CHICO!
HUH?
CHICO, LOOK!
"TO THE GOVERNOR
OF CALIFORNIA.
"I INTRODUCE
TO YOU HEREWITH
"COUNT BELMONTE,
MY PERSONAL TAX COLLECTOR,
"AND GENERAL TORRO,
CHIEF OF MY SECRET POLICE.
"THEY WILL REPORT ON
YOUR ACTIVITIES TO ME
"AND BRING ME,
ONCE AND FOR ALL,
YOUR TAXES.
"THEIR WILL IS
TO BE YOUR LAW.
SIGNED, ALFONSO."
WHO IS HE?
ALFONSO THE KING!
OH, CHICO, THESE ARE
TERRIBLY IMPORTANT MEN.
THEN MAYBE WE BETTER
SHOOT 'EM, HUH?
NO, YOU CAN'T.
THOSE SOLDIERS--
YOU ALREADY TOLD THEM
THAT THESE TWO ARE HERE.
AIEE! THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT WE CANNOT
LET THEM GO.
THEY WILL SNITCH
ON US!
THIS LETTER
WILL INTRODUCE THEM
TO THE GOVERNOR.
Jose: REMEMBER,
PLEASE REMEMBER,
NOT ONE WORD
ABOUT TAXES TO THEM.
I'VE PLANNED
ENTERTAINMENT
FOR ALL DAY LONG--
EVERY MOMENT
FILLED--
SO THEY WON'T HAVE
TIME TO ASK ABOUT
THE MONEY.
IS THAT RIGHT,
ISABELLA?
THAT'S RIGHT,
JOSE.
JUST KEEP THEM BUSY,
AND PRAY FOR A MIRACLE.
Gomez: ALL UP! UP!
SOLDIERS...
YOU ARE IN
A VERY BAD
POSITION.
YOU HAVE TO GO
THIS DIRECTION--
NEVER MIND ABOUT
THE SOLDIERS.
NEVER MIND ABOUT IT,
SOLDIERS.
AND, UH, MUSICIANS,
GO OVER THIS...
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE ALL RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE.
AND DON'T FORGET, NOW,
PLAY LOUD AND LONG.
NOT LONG. SHORT!
AND I SAY SHORT,
I MEAN--
YOUR EXCELLENCY!
YOU ARE DEMOTED!
WELL, WHY?
WHAT DID I DO NOW?
NOTHING.
THAT'S FOR NOTHING,
LIEUTENANT GOMEZ.
IS THAT RIGHT,
ISABELLA?
THEY'RE COMING.
THEY'RE COMING!
BE HAPPY.
SMILE,
EVERYBODY,
LIKE THIS.
RICARDO, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO ACT.
THEY WON'T BE FOOLED.
THEY'LL TAKE ONE LOOK
AT ME AND SHOOT.
CHICO, I KNOW
HOW GENTLEMEN ACT.
I'VE SEEN MANY OF
THEM IN THE HOTELS
WHERE I HAVE WORKED.
JUST DO EVERYTHING
I DO. COME ON.
FIRE!
IT'S A SALUTE
IN OUR HONOR.
IN OUR FACES!
SMILE. SMILE!
THIS IS REALLY LIVIN'.
IT MAY BE DYING.
THIS IS A VERY
CHARMING ROOM.
Jose: AND NOW,
GENTLEMEN,
MY MOST
PRECIOUS JEWEL,
MY DAUGHTER
TERESA.
TERESA, I WISH
TO PRESENT
HIS MAJESTY'S
EMISSARIES
COUNT BELMONTE
AND GENERAL TORRO.
Aiee.
WHA--UH...
DEAR, UH...
COUNT BELMONTE
AND GENERAL TORRO?
UH, TERESA, UH...
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO OUR GUESTS?
Chico: B-BUT
SHE DON'T NEED TO.
SH-SHE LOOK SO NICE
WHEN SHE DON'T SAY
NOTHING.
THANK YOU, UH...
BUT SHE WANTS TO SAY
IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO MEET YOU,
DON'T YOU, DEAR? HMM?
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.
UH, PERHAPS THE SENORITA
HAD IMAGINED ME AS BEING
QUITE DIFFERENT.
Jose: VERY DIFFERENT.
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
VERY PLEASANT,
ISN'T IT, DARLING?
YES, VERY PLEASANT.
NOW, UH,
SHE'S VERY ANXIOUS
FOR YOU
TO TRY OUR GOOD
CALIFORNIA WINE,
AREN'T YOU,
DEAR, YEAH?
YES,
VERY ANXIOUS.
WELL, UH...
Teresa: FATHER,
IF I COULD JUST
GO TO MY ROOM--
Jose:
YES, DEAR.
OH, GENERAL,
THE SECRET POLICE.
WHAT A DANGEROUS
LIFE YOU MUST LEAD.
BELIEVE ME.
COUNT BELMONTE,
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HONORED I AM
TO HAVE YOU
UNDER MY ROOF.
WHAT WAS THAT?
OH, A JOKE.
A FAMILY JOKE.
A VERY
FUNNY ONE.
Chico:
IF THE JOKE IS FINISHED,
YOU CAN TELL US
WHERE THE TAX MONEY IS, HUH?
NO.
NO?
WHY, UH...
I WOULDN'T THINK OF
BOTHERING NOW,
RIGHT AFTER
YOU HAVE ARRIVED,
WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
AND WEARY FROM
YOUR JOURNEY.
CERTAINLY NOT.
RIGHT NOW,
YOU SHOULD BE
ENTERTAINED.
^^ IF YOU STEAL
A KISS, DEAR ^^
^^ PLEASE BRING IT BACK
WITH THE DAWN ^^
^^ BUT IF YOU STEAL
MY HEART, DEAR ^^
^^ I'LL KNOW IT'S GONE ^^
^^ FOREVER GONE ^^
^^ GONE ^^
^^ FOREVER GONE ^^
EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.
FINE. FINE.
NOW WE CAN GO
AND GET THE TAXES, HUH?
TERESA, WHY DON'T
WE SHOW OUR GUESTS
THE REST OF THE HACIENDA?
WONDERFUL IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW THEM AROUND
THE PARTERRE,
TERESA, SLOWLY?
I MEAN,
SO THEY CAN SEE
ALL THE FLOWERS.
Ricardo: YES,
WHY DON'T YOU, SENORITA?
WELL, I THINK
AUNT ISABELLA
BETTER COME
ALONG, TOO.
SHE KNOWS THE
LATIN NAMES OF
ALL THE FLOWERS,
DON'T YOU,
AUNT ISABELLA?
B-BUT'S SHE'S THE--
COME ALONG,
GENERAL TORRO.
I AM COMING
RIGHT BACK.
HOW MANY FLOWERS
CAN THERE BE?
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
I'M VERY SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING,
AND IT'S ONE
OF YOUR GUESTS--
THAT GENERAL TORRO.
I HAVE A VERY
DEFINITE FEELING
I'VE SEEN HIM
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.
WHAT?
OF COURSE,
I DON'T SUPPOSE
I COULD HAVE
SEEN HIM ANYWHERE,
COULD I?
AFTER ALL, WITH ME
IN CALIFORNIA
AND HIM IN SPAIN...
STILL, IT DOES SEEM
TO ME THAT I'VE SEEN
THAT FACE SOMEWHERE.
GOMEZ...
WELL, I GUESS
I COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN IT
ANYWHERE
AFTER ALL, NO.
WELL, EXCUSE ME.
MAYBE THIS
OTHER FELLOW
WAS A RELATIVE.
SEEMS FUNNY
TO HAVE RELATIVES
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
LIKE THAT, THOUGH.
Isabella:
OH, GENERAL TORRO,
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WONDERFUL IT IS
FOR A WOMAN LIKE ME--
HERE IN THE WILDS
OF THIS TERRIBLE
CALIFORNIA--
TO MEET A MAN LIKE YOU.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH CALIFORNIA?
OH, THE MEN HERE
HAVE NO CONVERSATION.
BUT YOU,
FRESH FROM SPAIN,
MUST KNOW ALL
THE LATEST GOSSIP.
TELL ME,
WHAT'S NEW IN MADRID?
MADRID? UH...
OH, THE MEN
ARE CHASING THE WOMEN,
THE WOMEN
ARE CHASING THE MEN
THE SAME AS ALL OVER.
AH, BUT THEY DO IT
DIFFERENTLY IN SPAIN.
THEY DO? HOW?
Isabella:
AH, GENERAL.
WHEN THE KING TOLD ME
I MUST COME TO CALIFORNIA,
I THOUGHT, "HOW DREARY.
HOW VERY DULL.
A LAND OF PEASANTS
AND PEONS."
STOP IT.
YOU CAN JUST
STOP BEING
COUNT BELMONTE
RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,
YOU, YOU...
BANDIT, YOU?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
DID YOU COME
TO ROB MY FATHER,
IS THAT IT?
NO, NO.
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL ME
THAT YOU CAME HERE
JUST TO SEE ME.
WELL, YES.
OH, WHAT NONSENSE.
YOU HAD ME
IN YOUR POWER ONCE,
AND YOU--
YOU DIDN'T...
YOU MEAN...
I DIDN'T KISS YOU.
WHY DIDN'T YOU?
OH, ANYONE BUT YOU,
SENORITA.
YOU WERE SO LOVELY,
I JUST COULDN'T.
I...
THEN...LAST NIGHT?
I HAD TO FIND OUT
IF YOU WERE AS LOVELY
AS I REMEMBERED.
AND YOU WERE,
AND YOU ARE.
BUT I WAS TOLD THAT
THE KISSING BANDIT
HAD A HABIT OF...
KISSING PEOPLE.
WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME TO THE
HACIENDA LIKE THIS.
IT'S TERRIBLY
DANGEROUS FOR YOU.
YOU MIGHT BE KILLED.
DO YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T RISK MY LIFE
FOR A MOMENT WITH YOU?
AND BESIDE, WHAT IF
THERE IS DANGER?
I LIVE ON DANGER.
MANY A NIGHT MY MEN AND I
HAVE RIDDEN FOR MILES
TO SOME FAR-OFF HACIENDA
WHERE A LOVELY
SENORITA IS WAITING--
WAITING TO BE
SERENADED BY ME.
MANY A NIGHT
WE HAVE RIDDEN--
MANY A NIGHT, IS IT?
AFTER ALL, YOU SEE GIRLS
YOU WANT SO OFTEN
THAT YOU MUST RISK YOUR
LIFE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.
OH, NO!
OH, YES!
YOU KISS
EVERY WOMAN YOU SEE,
AND THEY LOVE IT.
THEY--THEY SWOON!
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT!
IT CERTAINLY IS
DIFFERENT.
FIRST, IF I WERE
ONE OF THE WOMEN
YOU KISSED,
I WOULDN'T SWOON,
I-I'D SCREAM.
AND SECOND,
I-I JUST WOULDN'T BE
ONE OF THE WOMEN
YOU KISSED,
NOT EVER.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
NOT EVER!
BUT, SENORITA,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.
YOU'D BETTER LEAVE
BEFORE I TELL
MY FATHER.
BUT IF YOU'LL ONLY--
FURTHERMORE,
DON'T YOU DARE
SPEAK TO ME
UNLESS IT'S
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY.
I THINK YOU'RE A...
I THINK YOU'RE...
WHAT'S MORE, I DON'T
EVEN LIKE YOU.
"MANY A NIGHT
THE LOVELY SENORITAS
ARE WAITING." OH!
I WONDER WHAT I SAID
THAT WAS WRONG?
ALL RIGHT, I LOOKED AT
ALL THE FLOWERS.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT
ALL THE TAXES.
CHICO, I THINK
WE'D BETTER FORGET
ABOUT THE TAXES
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
FORGET ABOUT THE--
NOW? WHEN WE GOT
THE MONEY RIGHT
UNDER OUR NOSE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU? WHY?
IS IT THAT GIRL?
WELL, THINGS
HAVEN'T BEEN GOING
THE WAY I'D PLANNED.
I DON'T THINK
SHE LIKES ME.
SIT DOWN.
LITTLE ONE,
NO ONE'S AROUND,
SO TELL ME SOMETHING,
MAN TO MAN.
HAVE YOU--HAVE YOU HAD
MUCH TO DO WITH WOMEN?
NOT MUCH.
RICARDO, TELL ME THE TRUTH.
BEFORE YOU KISSED TERESA,
DID YOU EVER KISS ANYONE ELSE?
AND YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE,
MAN TO MAN?
I DIDN'T EVEN
KISS TERESA.
BAH! AIEE!
OH, NOW WE GOTTA STAY HERE.
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT
SPEAKING ABOUT THE MONEY.
BUT A KISSING BANDIT
WHO NEVER KISSED A WOMAN!
OH, IT'S NO GOOD
FOR YOUR REPUTATION,
YOUR FATHER'S REPUTATION.
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
YOU GOTTA START RIGHT NOW,
WITH THIS GIRL.
BUT, CHICO,
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME.
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU?
WHO SAYS
SHE DIDN'T LIKE YOU?
SHE DID.
SHE DID? WHAT DOES
SHE KNOW ABOUT IT?
WOMEN ALWAYS SAY NO,
AS I REMEMBER.
WELL, MAYBE
SOMETIMES
THEY MEAN IT.
NAH, RICARDO, LISTEN.
THEY ALWAYS WANT
TO SAY YES,
BUT WHEN THEY ARE
LITTLE GIRLS,
THEIR MOTHERS TELL THEM,
"DON'T MAKE IT EASY,
MAKE IT TOUGH."
SO...YOU GOTTA
MAKE EYES A LITTLE,
FLIRT A LITTLE,
WASTE A LITTLE TIME...
THEN THEY SAY YES, ALWAYS.
THIS I DO REMEMBER.
HMM.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
PERHAPS I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE TOO QUICK,
TRIED TO RUSH THINGS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.
SURE, SURE.
BUT NOW YOU GOT
A LITTLE TIME, SEE?
SO YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOUR LITTLE JOB.
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF MY LITTLE JOB.
I'M GONNA ASK THAT
DON JOSE AGAIN FOR THE TAXES,
AND THIS TIME,
HE'D BETTER SAY YES.
NOW, SIESTA.
IT'S TIME FOR SIESTA.
EVERYBODY SLEEPS.
CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY,
YOU KNOW.
COME ALONG.
BUT WE GOT--
SHH. SIESTA.
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA, MMM ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ GO 'WAY, FLY,
STOP YOUR BUZZIN' BY ^^
^^ CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I
NEED SIESTA? ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ LEAVE ME BE,
GO AWAY FROM ME ^^
^^ NEED MY ENERGY
FOR SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ I WANT TO DREAM OF
A MAID AND A ROSE ^^
^^ BUT HOW CAN I DREAM
WHEN YOU PERCH ON MY NOSE? ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ GET OFF OF MY CHIN,
GET OUT OF MY EAR ^^
^^ GET OFF OF MY NOSE,
GET OUT OF HERE ^^
^^ GET OUT OF MY LIFE,
I'M TALKING TO YOU ^^
^^ FLY ^^
^^ WHY DON'T YOU SHOO,
FLY, SHOO? ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
^^ GO 'WAY, FLY,
STOP YOUR BUZZIN' BY ^^
^^ DON'T YOU RUIN MY
SIESTA ^^
^^ SIESTA ^^
Jose: ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE YOU.
SENORS, SENORAS,
MY HONORED GUESTS,
THE EMISSARIES OF
HIS MAJESTY THE KING:
COUNT BELMONTE,
GENERAL TORRO.
SAY A LITTLE
SOMETHING.
I'M SURE THAT HIS MAJESTY
WOULD WANT ME TO SAY
THAT HE LOVES YOU ALL.
AND AS FOR THE GENERAL
AND MYSELF, WHY...
WE'RE COMPLETELY
OVERWHELMED
BY THE LOVELY WOMEN
OF CALIFORNIA.
Woman: NICE TO
HAVE YOU HERE.
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO STAY
WITH US, COUNT?
Second woman:
I HOPE YOU'LL MAKE
YOUR VISIT QUITE LONG
AND ENJOY OUR PEOPLE
AND THE SIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA.
GENERAL, WHY SHOULD
WE TALK ABOUT TAXES?
IT'S REALLY, UH...
OH...
LET'S ENJOY OUR DINNER,
EH, GENERAL?
Chico: OH, BUT YOU'RE
FORGETTING ALFONSO.
HE'S THE KING!
HE'S THE ONE TOLD US
GET THE TAXES
AND GET OUT QUICK.
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA DO.
GENERAL,
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
THINK OF LEAVING
BEFORE THE FIESTA.
I'M SAVING ALL
MY DANCES FOR YOU.
NO, NO, I--
THE GENERAL IS RATHER
SHY WITH THE LADIES,
DONA ISABELLA.
HE'S BEEN
A BACHELOR TOO LONG.
NOBODY CAN BE
A BACHELOR TOO LONG.
AH, GENERAL, YOU'RE
SO COMPLICATED,
SO COMPLEX,
SO FULL OF MYSTERY.
FULL OF WHAT?
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.
AH, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T MET
THE RIGHT WOMAN.
EVERY MAN
NEEDS A WOMAN
TO INSPIRE HIM.
OH, THAT'S SO TRUE.
EVERY MAN NEEDS
A LOVELY LADY
TO ENCOURAGE HIM,
TO URGE HIM ON
TO GREAT DEEDS.
YES, AND TO MARRY HIM.
WELL, TO ME,
COUNT BELMONTE SEEMS
THE TYPE OF MAN
THAT, UH, WOULD PREFER
A VARIETY OF WOMEN
RATHER THAN
ANY PARTICULAR ONE.
OH, NO, NO.
REALLY, HONESTLY!
YOU SEE, DEAR?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
DEAR?
AND I THINK
IT'S PERFECTLY HORRIBLE
THE WAY PARENTS TRY
TO ARRANGE MARRIAGES,
ESPECIALLY TO PEOPLE
THEY HARDLY KNOW.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'D LIKE TO GO TO MY ROOM.
I WANT TO CHANGE MY DRESS.
B-BUT I THINK
YOUR DRESS
IS BEAUTIFUL.
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?
WELL, I DON'T.
YOU SEE, TERESA FEELS
THAT MARRIAGES SHOULD
NOT BE ARRANGED,
BUT SHOULD BE FOR LOVE.
OH, I THINK SHE'S RIGHT, TOO.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
IN MARRYING FOR LOVE.
TAKE MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER.
HE ABDUCTED HER.
HE ABDUCTED HER.
DON'T SCREAM.
I NEVER SCREAM.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
I'VE COME TO TAKE
YOU AWAY WITH ME,
TO CARRY YOU
OVER THE BORDER,
SOMEPLACE WHERE
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.
DO YOU MEAN
YOU WANT TO
ABDUCT ME?
YES. WE'VE
DILLYDALLIED
LONG ENOUGH.
OH, BUT THIS IS
SO UNEXPECTED, AND--
AND, WELL, I HAVE
OTHER THINGS TO DO.
MY FATHER'S DOWNSTAIRS
WAITING FOR ME,
AND WE HAVE
A LOT OF GUESTS AND...
BUT IN AN ABDUCTION,
THESE TRIVIAL THINGS
DON'T MATTER.
BUT I'M NOT
DRESSED. LOOK!
OH! OH, I BEG
YOUR PARDON.
I HAD NO IDEA!
I MEAN...I'M SORRY.
MAY I SEE YOU ABOUT THIS
LATER, DOWNSTAIRS?
HMM, MAYBE.
^^ THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME ^^
^^ HE TRIED TO ABDUCT ME ^^
^^ LA DA DE DUM ^^
^^ LA DA DE DUM ^^
^^ MM-HMM ^^
Sometime,
this Don Jose
has gotta stop
finding things
for me to look at.
Keep the governor
busy.
I gonna get
the money now.
BUT ABOUT
THE MONEY, I--
BELIEVE ME,
WE NEED IT!
AHA! NOW I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.
AND I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, TOO.
EVER SINCE YOU CAME HERE,
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.
AND I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU, TOO.
YOU HAVE?
YES, I HAVE.
AND IF EVER I SAW
A CRIMINAL FACE,
YOU GOT IT.
OH, NO.
OH, YES. AND IF
YOU DON'T KEEP
OUT OF MY SIGHT,
I'M GONNA REMEMBER
YOUR CRIME.
THEN YOU'LL
BE SORRY.
BUT I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.
YES, YOU DID.
YOU KNOW WHAT.
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DID I DO?
YES, YOU DO.
IF YOU DON'T
LOOK OUT,
YOU KNOW

BOTTOM STEP.

YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
BOTH OF YOU
WERE SIMPLY WONDERFUL.
WHY, IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
DANCE I'VE EVER SEEN.
Woman: OH,

HE TELLS THAT
TO EVERY DANCER
HE SEES.
WELL, I NEVER MET
ANY DANCERS IN BOSTON.

YOUR EXCELLENCY
BEEN IN BOSTON?
WHY, YES, I--
I MEAN,
I CAME THROUGH BOSTON
ON MY WAY
FROM MADRID, YOU SEE,
AND IT'S...
OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

Together: ^^ I GIVE THEM

TERESA, I LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH.
YOU'VE NEVER
SAID THAT BEFORE.
I'VE NEVER SAID IT
TO ANYONE BEFORE.
BUT IT'S WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE SAID
THE MOMENT I SAW YOU,
BECAUSE I KNEW IT THEN.
YES...
BUT IT DIDN'T
SEEM POSSIBLE
IT COULD
HAPPEN SO FAST.
I--I COULDN'T
ADMIT IT TO MYSELF.
BUT IT'S TRUE.
IT DID HAPPEN.
YES, I--I KNOW.
TERESA...
Chico: RICARDO!
RI--
SENORITA,
YOUR FATHER'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.
BUT, CHICO, TERESA
AND I WERE JUST--
YOU STAY HERE.
I WANT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.
WELL, DON'T KEEP
YOUR FATHER
WAITING.
OH, OH, RICARDO, I--
WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
SHE'LL TELL YOU
LATER?
WELL, I'LL
TELL YOU NOW.
WHY, CHICO,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
YOU'VE GOT COBWEBS
ON YOU!
BELIEVE ME,
THAT'S ALL I GOT ON ME.
THAT ROBBER,
THAT FINE GOVERNOR
OF CALIFORNIA--
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I FOUND
IN THE TREASURY?
AND BELIEVE ME,
THEY LOOK HOMEMADE!
COME ON. NOW WE
GOTTA LEAVE HERE
FOR SURE!
WONDERFUL!
ONLY I'D LIKE TO
WAIT FOR TERESA.
OH, CHICO, I HOPE
SHE GOES WITH US.
WHY DO YOU WANT HER
TO GO WITH US?
YOU'VE HAD
ENOUGH TIME
TO KISS HER.
BUT I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.
I WANT TO MARRY HER.
I WANT HER
FOR A LIFETIME.
A LI...
LIFETIME?
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.
GET ON YOUR HORSE,
RIDE AWAY FROM HERE,
NEVER SEE HER NO MORE.
OH, I COULDN'T DO THAT!
THEN I DON'T THINK
YOU LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
LITTLE ONE, IT'S TIME
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.
YOU ARE A BANDIT!
AND THAT IS WHAT
YOU DECIDED TO BE, NO?
YES, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING THAT SAYS
A BANDIT CAN'T HAVE
A WIFE, CHICO.
WHY, IN ALL THE BOOKS
I'VE READ, IT JUST--
BOOKS!
THIS IS NOT A BOOK,
RICARDO MIO.
THIS IS NOT A DREAM
YOU ARE DREAMING.
BUT THIS IS
YOUR LIFE NOW.
A BANDIT'S LIFE--
HARD, SOMETIMES
VERY SHORT.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO
GOOD THINGS IN
A BANDIT'S LIFE--
UH, FREEDOM,
EXCITEMENT,
AND ADVENTURE.
SURE, FOR YOU.
BUT FOR A GENTLE
YOUNG GIRL LIKE TERESA
TO SPEND HER LIFE
HIDING, RUNNING AWAY,
IN DANGER...
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT FOR HER?
NO, NO.
OF COURSE NOT.
SURE NOT.
IT'S FUNNY.
BECAUSE I'M A BANDIT CHIEF,
I WAS ABLE TO WIN
MY HEROINE.
AND BECAUSE
I'M A BANDIT CHIEF,
I HAVE TO GIVE HER UP.
I REALIZE I HAVE
NO RIGHT TO HER, CHICO.
LET'S GO.
Teresa:
^^ LOVE IS WHERE YOU FIND IT ^^
^^ DON'T BE BLIND,
IT'S ALL AROUND YOU ^^
^^ EVERYWHERE ^^
^^ TAKE IT,
TAKE A CHANCE NOW ^^
^^ FOR ROMANCE NOW ^^
^^ TELL SOME ONE
THAT YOU CARE ^^
^^ SPRING LOVE COMES UPON YOU ^^
^^ WHEN IT'S GONE,
YOU FEEL DESPAIR ^^
^^ SOON, THOUGH,
IN THE MOONGLOW ^^
^^ YOU'LL FIND THAT
A NEW LOVE IS THERE ^^
^^ LOVE IS WHERE YOU FIND IT ^^
^^ FATE DESIGNED IT
TO BE WAITING ^^
^^ EVERYWHERE ^^
^^ IT MAY HIDE FROM YOU
FOR A WHILE ^^
^^ IT MAY COME TONIGHT
IN A FIRE ^^
^^ FAN THE FLAME
OF A NEW LOVE ^^
^^ IN THE ARMS OF
A NEW LOVE ^^
^^ TAKE THAT CHANCE
ON LOVE ^^
^^ AH... ^^
^^ LOVE IS WHERE YOU FIND IT ^^
^^ DON'T BE BLIND,
IT'S ALL AROUND YOU ^^
^^ EVERYWHERE ^^
^^ AH ^^
^^ AH ^^
LITTLE ONE, COME ON.
LET US GET OUT.
Isabella:
GENERAL TORRO,
THIS IS THE MOMENT
FOR WHICH I'VE BEEN
WAITING AND WAITING.
BUT WE GOT BUSINESS--
LET US DANCE.
BUT I DON'T DANCE
TOO GOOD.
DARLING!
TERESA, I--
WHAT I WANTED
TO SAY WAS THAT
I'LL GO AWAY
WITH YOU NOW.
THAT IS, IF YOU
STILL WANT ME TO.
TERESA, UH...
I'M A BANDIT, AND MAYBE
YOU OUGHT TO REALIZE--
I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU
ANY OTHER WAY.
SHALL WE GO?
UH, TERESA,
WOULD YOU DANCE WITH ME,
JUST THIS ONCE?
ALL RIGHT.
AH, GENERAL,
YOUR DANCING IS
JUST LIKE YOU ARE--
COMPLICATED.
YES, I THINK SO.
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?
I KNOW THAT FACE FROM--
AIEE!
Man: STOP! STOP!
STOP EVERYTHING,
IN THE KING'S NAME!
I AM COUNT BELMONTE.
GUARDS, THOSE TWO MEN
ARE IMPOSTORS. SEIZE THEM!
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR?
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR?
WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR,
I SAY?
I-I'M DON JOSE,
THE GOVERNOR.
YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE
THAT MAY COST YOU
YOUR HEAD.
YOU'RE JUST
WHAT I EXPECTED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
SEND ALL THESE PEOPLE HOME--
EVERYBODY. GET RID OF THEM.
BRING THOSE TWO MEN HERE!
LOOK AT THIS MAN,
GOVERNOR.
THIS, YOU FOOL,
IS THE MAN KNOWN AS
THE KISSING BANDIT;
THE OTHER,
HIS CHIEF ACCOMPLICE.
GUARDS, TAKE THEM AWAY!
THROW THEM IN CHAINS!
HAVE A GALLOWS BUILT!
HANG THEM!
OH, COUNT BELMONTE,
PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T HANG THEM.
YOU JUST CAN'T!
AND WHO IS THIS?
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER TERESA.
SHE IS VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
IF THE SENORITA
WOULD HONOR ME
WITH HER PRESENCE
FOR A WHILE,
I MIGHT BE INCLINED
TO FEEL MORE KINDLY
TOWARD HER FATHER
AND THIS ENTIRE,
DISGRACEFUL SITUATION.
OH, SH-SHE WOULD
BE DELIGHTED.
WOULDN'T YOU, DEAR?
SHE WOULD BE
DELIGHTED.
Belmonte:
HANG THE BANDITS AT DAWN.
AHEM. GREETINGS,
GENTLEMEN.
Chico: WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?
WELL, I'VE BEEN
DEMOTED TO PRIVATE.
NOW, THAT MAY SOUND
BAD TO YOU,
BUT I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT PRIVATES ARE
THE ONLY ONES
THE GOVERNOR
CAN AFFORD TO PAY.
SO NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I'M GETTING MONEY
FOR BEING IN THE ARMY.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR YOUR LAST SUPPER?
I DON'T WANT
NOTHING.
BUT WHAT DO
YOU WANT, GOMEZ?
BECAUSE MAYBE
THIS IS YOUR
LAST SUPPER, TOO.
YOU'RE IN PRETTY
MUCH HOT WATER,
AREN'T YOU?
I AM? AGAIN?
DON'T YOU THINK SO?
WHY, NO.
WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE KING IS GONNA SAY
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
YOU THREW ME,
THE CHIEF OF POLICE,
IN JAIL?
AND ME--
COUNT BELMONTE?
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE JUST IMPERSONATING
THESE PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL.
WHO SAID THAT?
OH, EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.
DON'T BELIEVE IT.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GENERAL TORRO
AND COUNT BELMONTE, ARE YOU?
WEREN'T WE
INTRODUCED TO YOU
BY THE GOVERNOR AS
BELMONTE AND TORRO?
DO YOU THINK
THE GOVERNOR
WOULD LIE TO YOU?
THAT'S A TERRIBLE
THING TO SAY ABOUT
THE GOVERNOR.
I DON'T LIKE YOUR
ATTITUDE, GOMEZ.
I'D BE MORE CAREFUL
IF I WERE YOU.
PLEASE,
PUT DOWN THE KEYS.
THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS.
EVERYTHING WAS
ALL CLEAR TO ME UNTIL
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
WELL, LISTEN TO ME,
AND WE'LL CLEAR IT
ALL UP FOR YOU.
IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE.
IT'S REALLY
NOT DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND AT ALL.
WE TAKE CARE OF
EVERYTHING.
WHEN WE FIRST
GOT HERE, YOU SEE...
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
NOW, DON'T GO
NOPLACE.
Gomez: LOOK, THE GOVERNOR
WON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
GO ON, GO ON!
LOOK!
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE
WITH A MAN LIKE HIM!
BUT IT'S NOT OUR
BUSINESS. GO ON!
THIS IS MY BUSINESS!
Chico: AIEE!
THAT'LL TEACH YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!
Belmonte: TORRO! DON JOSE!
CALL OUT THE GUARDS!
TORRO! TORRO!
STAY OUT
OF THIS, CHICO.
THIS IS MY AFFAIR.
TORRO, DRAW YOUR SWORD
AND CUT THESE MEN TO RIBBONS!
YOU STAY OUT,
AND THEY STAY OUT!
TERESA, YOU'D BETTER
GO INSIDE.
THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR A LADY.
VERY WELL, RICARDO.
NOW, ARE YOU READY?
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!
I DON'T FIGHT PEASANTS!
PUT UP YOUR FISTS!
HOW UNFAIR!
HOLD IT! STOP IT!
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE IN JAIL!
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HELP COUNT BELMONTE.
WELL, I...NO.
BUT I SHOULDN'T HELP
A MAN WHO IS A BANDIT.
IT'LL BE MUCH BETTER
IF HE WINS.
WELL, I-I...
AH, GENERAL.
I MEAN...
MR. BANDIT.
BUT EVEN IF
RICARDO WINS,
HE'S STILL
A BANDIT.
SURELY YOU CAN
PARDON HIM,
CAN'T YOU?
YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR,
AREN'T YOU?
THAT STILL LEAVES
THE PROBLEM OF BELMONTE.
YOU COULD ORDER HIM
OUT OF THE TERRITORY,
COULDN'T YOU?
HE GOES BACK
WITHOUT THE TAXES,
ALFONSO WILL
CUT OFF HIS HEAD.
WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?
AIEE!
WHY DON'T YOU
APPOINT SOMEONE
TO COLLECT THE MONEY
FOR YOU?
WHOM?
YOU HAVE A MAN
RIGHT OVER HERE WHO
HAS MORE EXPERIENCE
COLLECTING MONEY
THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN CALIFORNIA.
I DON'T WANT
THE JOB.
THERE'LL BE
A COMMISSION.
THEN MAYBE
I'LL TAKE IT.
YOU'RE HIRED.
THERE'S MY MAN
TO HELP YOU.
I DON'T WANT
YOUR MAN.
I GOT MY OWN.
IT'S A DEAL.
WELL, JOSE,
YOU ARE
THE GOVERNOR,
AREN'T YOU?
BELMONTE, GET OUT
OF CALIFORNIA!
I'M THE GOVERNOR!
FINE, LITTLE ONE.
Torro: COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
THIS CALIFORNIA CLIMATE
DON'T AGREE WITH YOU, EITHER.
Isabella: I THINK
YOU'LL FIND TERESA
WAITING FOR YOU INSIDE.
THANK YOU,
DONA ISABELLA,
BUT I CAN'T STAY.
IF SHE CARED
FOR ME AT ALL,
IT WAS BECAUSE
I WAS A BANDIT.
I'M NO LONGER
A BANDIT.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING UP TO PACK.
RUN AFTER HIM,
CHICO.
MAKE HIM
CHANGE HIS MIND.
AFTER ALL, YOU'VE BEEN
OUTLAWS TOGETHER.
WHY NOT IN-LAWS
TOGETHER?
YE-YEAH.
TOGETHER?
Y-YOU CANNOT DO IT,
LITTLE ONE.
YOU CANNOT GO AWAY.
I'M SORRY, CHICO.
I'M GOING
BACK TO BOSTON.
I MADE UP MY MIND.
PLEASE, RICARDO.
GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND TALK TO
TERESA FIRST.
NO, CHICO.
IT'S ALL OVER WITH.
THEN THINK OF ME.
I'M IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.
I CANNOT FACE IT ALONE!
IT'S THAT--
THAT ISABELLA.
I AM AFRAID
I AM ENGAGED.
OH, IT'S...
FINE NEWS, CHICO.
I DON'T KNOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.
FOR ME, THERE'S
NOTHING, I GUESS--
NO MORE ADVENTURE,
NO MORE ROMANCE...
Teresa:
^^ IF YOU'LL STILL KISS ME ^^
^^ I HOPE YOU'LL RETURN HERE
SOME DAY ^^
^^ IF YOU STEAL
MY DREAMS, DEAR ^^
^^ PLEASE GIVE THEM BACK... ^^
TERESA, YOU DON'T
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND!
^^ SOME WAY ^^
^^ IF YOU TAKE MY MIDNIGHT ^^
^^ PLEASE BRING IT BACK
WITH THE DAWN... ^^
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST TELL YOU!
^^ BUT IF YOU STEAL
MY HEART, DEAR ^^
^^ I'LL KNOW IT'S GONE ^^
^^ FOREVER GONE ^^
TERESA, LOOK,
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
THIS CLEAR TO YOU.
I AM NOT A BANDIT.
MY FATHER WAS
THE KISSING BANDIT.
I WAS NEVER A BANDIT.
I COULDN'T BE A BANDIT
IN A MILLION YEARS.
I-I DIDN'T INHERIT
ONE SINGLE THING
FROM MY FATHER--
NOT ONE SINGLE THING.
AIEE!
MMM...
OR DID I?
