Bill, with electrification, there'll be
a revolution in the American kitchen.
Our company has got designs for
an electric toast-making machine.
I hear stories of a stove that heats up
all by itself, at the flip of a switch.
What do you think of that? Yes sir, the
future of house ware sales is unlimited.
I feel danged lucky to be part of it.
─ That sounds mighty fine Mr Simms.
Now .. you're darn tooting it's fine.
Of course, to a man my age, the future
don't mean much, except past next week.
Just hang on a minute there Bill.
I want to show you something.
I'm sure I got one here.
Now, what do you think of that?
This would hook on to the side of the
board or on top of a table or something.
Now see that action. Watch
this .. put her on there.
That's really something.
Isn't that something?
What do you think of that?
A fine piece of workmanship.
─ I'll tell you Bill ..
This is the kind of product that in
the future will make your head spin.
Why don't you try one?
─ I'd hate to break it.
You won't break this.
These will last a lifetime.
That's it.
Are you a .. a seafaring man, Bill?
─ Pardon?
Well I just noticed that tattoo there.
─ I've never been to sea.
What kind of work do you do, Bill?
─ Well, I'm between jobs right now.
No kidding. Well, what
kind of work did you do?
I robbed stagecoaches.
Hello Jenny.
I've brought you this little
gizmo from San Francisco.
I guess I have aged some.
This little machine .. peels
apples real good.
Come on .. let's go and meet Tom.
What can you do?
─ I'll find work.
I hear they're hiring
over at the oyster-beds.
It will be easier .. than
where I've been.
I know about where you've been.
And what you done to get there.
I frankly .. don't have
much use for your kind.
Well I .. hope I have a chance
to soften your opinion on that.
What I think about you
is neither here nor there.
You are Jenny's brother .. you
can stay if that's what she wants.
This isn't what I had in mind, sir.
I'd prefer something .. with
a little more heft to it.
May I look at that?
─ The Colt?
Hey .. Miner. You're Bill Miner, right?
Have we met, sir?
─ I'm Dan Young. I was in San Quentin ..
Four years back. Remember when you got
knifed by Bill Hitch? You remember that?
I don't remember you.
─ I thought that you died.
Well I haven't.
You're in luck, Bill.
I've put together a gang.
Like Jesse James?
I figured we'd do some holdups.
That's your line, right?
No .. I just rob stagecoaches.
Have you tried to find one nowadays?
Besides, stagecoaches, banks,
stores. They're all the same.
No, it's not the same.
A professional always specializes.
Well yours has gone.
Just like the buffalo.
Maybe I could teach you something new.
How do you rob these banks?
Simple. All I need is four or
five guys with guns and guts.
Well that sounds simple enough.
─ So you want to throw in with me? Right?
No thanks.
─ Why not?
I don't work for anybody.
You're getting a little old
to be choosy, ain't you?
Well, that's exactly why I have to be.
I've got to go.
─ Hey no. Come on, come on. Look ..
Why don't you lend me
a couple of dollars, huh?
I know you got at least twenty, thirty
dollars in your release envelope.
A professional never begs.
I ain't begging you Grandpa!
You give me the money.
Well, maybe I do have something for you.
You're not worth killing, but if ..
You come at me again, I'll put a
window through your head, so help me.
I apologize for this
disturbance, gentlemen.
I'm no oyster-picker.
But I thought things ..
Were going so well.
You have work .. and a place with us.
What will you do?
Move out .. head down Portland way.
Maybe do some prospecting.
The gold-rush is over Bill.
Sounds like I missed out on
all the good opportunities.
Please stay.
Since my release from prison .. I've
realized something about myself.
I've got to act on it.
I'm just no good at work that's
planned by other heads.
I've got ambitions in me,
that just won't quit.
Keep the engine crew ahead of you.
Check him out.
Let's get out of here!
Give us his name, son.
Miner.
Get this lad some water.
Morning.
─ Hello.
Is .. this the road to Olympia?
Ten more miles will get you there.
Chew of tobacco?
─ Thank you, sir.
Looks like you been walking some.
Not the best idea for a man your age.
I haven't got any choice,
I've got a brother dying there.
I couldn't walk a mile
with this leg of mine.
Morning, Mr Laughton.
I guess you're wanting your mail?
Hey George! Say, what you get?
Sons of bitches. They deducted my bed
and board. Even took out for my gloves.
Yeah, the railroad will shave you
six ways to Sunday, George.
Why call this a factory? The railroad
is everything. Both sides of the track
Looks like rain.
Have you ever been to Montreal?
Me?
─ Listen ..
You know a man can afford those luxuries,
if he's willing to take a few chances.
Well sure .. sure! Yep ..
First thing we got to do is, we
got to get you a good horse.
Get a horse?
I never had a horse.
I don't know how to ride one.
You'll learn.
─ Sure will.
Learn to ride.
Wait for my signal, then pull ahead.
Hurry up son, bust her loose.
You tell him to open that door
and throw out any weapons.
Open up Herb!
Is that you, Nat?
─ Yep.
What's going on?
I think we're being robbed.
─ You  being robbed!
Now open the damned door, or
we'll blow it off with dynamite.
Do they have dynamite, Nat?
Most certaïnly do, Herb.
I want the registered pouch .. now!
Back up .. way back!
Goodnight.
Now you be careful backing up.
Must be more than a thousand
dollars in real money right here.
The gold dust must be
worth five, ten thousand.
We can buy our own railroad.
Well, for the time being,
we're not going to buy anything.
What do you mean?
─ We'll just draw attention to ourselves.
We'll take some of the
cash .. hide the rest of it.
Settle down, Shorty.
It will be midday before they can
get men or horses to the crossing.
They won't know which way we went.
What do we do with this stuff?
─ We bury it.
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?
Does Mr Jack Budd
manage this hotel, son?
Yes sir. Can I get him for you?
─ That would be great.
Would you tell him
"George Edwards" is here.
Yes, sir.
Hello Jack.
─ Oh yes .. "George Edwards".
It's been a long time, but
I've been expecting you.
Let's have some coffee.
Do they know it was me?
Yeah .. the fingerprint guys
identified you from the CPR.
It seems they're still chasing you for
that messy business down in Oregon.
My men failed to use the engine
crew for shields .. it was bad.
I see you didn't make the
same mistake in Silverdale.
No, we used the Chapman method
there. That's the only reliable way.
They say you got away
with $7,000 in gold dust.
A .. fraction of that.
They always stretch the truth, Jack.
Shorty and I need a place
to lie low for a while.
What's in it for me, Bill?
─ I'm sure you'll think of something.
You bet I will.
The law thinks you've gone
south, back into Washington.
I'll have to invent a cover-story
to explain you and your partner.
I appreciate this, Jack.
I see you're still working with idiots.
Don't mark Shorty down.
He's got plenty of spunk.
Good .. I've got work to go to.
Whoa.
Do you own this?
─ Yep.
Won it in a card game
a couple of months back.
The Assay Office says
there's a gold trace.
Louis!
I don't know a thing about mining, Jack.
─ Well, you do now.
I've been telling a story in town that
you're two mining engineers from Idaho.
So, we have to work our
butts off in your mine, huh?
You'd rather be known as
a couple of train robbers?
I brought you some company Louis.
This is George Edwards and ..
That's Shorty Dunn.
Louis Colquhoun, boys.
That man works in your mine?
Yeah .. in return for room and
board at the hotel. Same as you.
I know that cough, Jack.
He's got the consumption.
Well, he used to be a schoolteacher back
East. He came out here for his health.
He's a good worker.
Well .. the dampness will kill him.
Oh, it's a tough old world.
So, you had better get
to work .. Mr "Edwards".
Do you like oranges, son?
I must insist that you publish it.
Your "Letters To The Editor" section is
meant to be a forum for public opinion.
I am a member of that public.
Miss Flanners, I have told you already ..
I reserve the right to publish letters
I deem of interest to our readership.
Now .. your letter is of no
interest to people around here.
Mr Wilks ..
I refuse to allow your editorial against
the Women's League to go unopposed.
It is absolutely imperative ..
That your readership be informed ..
That women, working in factories,
in this very province ..
Are being paid one third of the wages
being paid to men for the same jobs.
Your editorial failed to mention that.
People around here don't seem to
share your passion for Trade Unions.
Mr Wilks .. Kamloops
is not .. the planet Mars.
We have a transcontinental
railway on the edge of town.
And it brings ideas here, Mr Wilks.
Not just goods and supplies.
It is the purpose of your paper to lead
public opinion, not to curry its favor.
I will not be told my purpose in life by
someone who doesn't understand her own.
Mr Wilks.
You have the mentality
of a .. grocery clerk.
Thank you!
I'd like to purchase some
back-copies from your newspapers.
Certainly, sir.
Nothing wrong with her,
a husband wouldn't fix.
Law agencies in British Columbia and
the states of Washington and Oregon.
Confirmed that the search for
William Miner and his accomplice ..
Is concentrated on the Whatcom
County, Washington area.
Where Miner is known to have resided
following his release from San Quentin.
They figure that Bill Miner's just us.
I don't believe Miner could have
planned it any better than I did.
Oh don't get me wrong George,
you did great for a nobody.
There is more here, Shorty
The identity of Miner's
accomplice remains unknown.
The train crew described this man as ..
Short, dirty, nervous
and unintelligent.
Hell .. I've never been
nervous in my life.
Hello there.
That's a Police Officer.
Relax. We aren't breaking any laws.
Hello there.
─ Morning to you.
You must be the men
working for Jack Budd?
Yes we are. This is Shorty Dunn.
and I'm George Edwards.
I guess I gave you a
bit of a start back there.
I guess you're our local
Law Enforcement officer?
That's correct. I'm Corporal Fern.
Are you .. ?
Are you having any
luck with this old mine?
Oh, a few traces of
zinc and lead so far ..
Yeah, I told Jack Budd this ridge runs
the wrong direction for gold seams.
But I guess there is no reasoning
with a man and his hunches.
Well, that's about right.
Though they've had some success with the
same type of formation, down Idaho way.
Yeah, Jack told me
you were up from Idaho.
Where, exactly?
─ Kellogg.
Well .. I was just passing by
and I thought I should meet you.
You'll be careful with
those explosives, I hope.
Yes sir. Caution makes for longer life.
─ That it does.
Well .. good-day, gentlemen.
Good day.
Are you two in some kind of trouble
with the law?          ─ Nope.
Shorty just don't like
policemen .. that's all.
I know a man down at Cash Creek who
would pay a nice price for good horses.
Well .. rustling isn't my line.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it a lot more
than working in that mine, Bill.
Are you going to help us steal them?
I didn't think so.
You're real good at figuring
out the angles, but ..
You don't have much stomach
for the risky parts, do you.
Well, that's how come I spent more
time outside prison than in it.
Three-way split .. you, me and Shorty.
Fifty-fifty.
Three ways .. take it or leave it.
Alright .. it's a deal.
When will you do it?
Well .. I'll have to have
a little time to plan it out.
I'll see you.
I was attracted by the sound of your
music.          ─ I know who you are.
You are the man in the
newspaper office, last week.
My name is George Edwards.
─ How long have you been lurking about?
I really wasn't lurking.
Isn't that an aria from "Martha"?
You know opera?
Not well, but I did attend that one.
A long time ago, in Chicago.
My name is Katherine Flynn.
─ It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.
Would I be intruding if I
stayed to hear your record?
I suppose not.
I admired the way you handled
that publisher, Miss Flynn.
A lot of good it did me Mr Edwards.
In this country you're not taken
seriously unless you're ..
Caucasian, protestant,
and most of all .. male.
Well, sometimes even that ain't enough.
You have a point there, Mr Edwards.
So you left Kentucky
when you were Twenty .. why?
Well, it was kind of dull on the
farm, and I wanted adventure.
And adventure found you.
─ Yes it did.
I was with the U.S. Cavalry in
the Arizona Indian wars.
On the side of the
oppressors, Mr Edwards.
Well, I didn't see it quite like that at
the time. Of course, I was very young.
Not near as wise as you.
So then you went into the mining
business, yes?             ─ Uhuh.
But .. you don't seem like a man
who's spent his life underground.
Thank you.
Of course, my parents were mortified
when one asked to marry me.
I, on the contrary, was
ecstatic at such good fortune.
Ecstatic?
Of course.
I never wanted to be
like everybody else.
Well, you're certainly not.
Thank you.
A tomato, Mr Edwärds.
I never concurred with the
idea that they're poisonous.
I found my passion in
the art of photography.
And much to my father's dismay ..
Elected to make my
own way in this world.
So, five years ago I .. boarded
a train and came West.
Well there .. isn't much out
here to take pictures of.
You're quite wrong Mr Edwards.
A country in transition.
Filled with beauty.
And despair.
You might be .. shocked at some of the
injustices I've recorded with my camera.
Well, perhaps someday, you'll be kind
enough to let me see your pictures.
Your face has fascinating flames
Mr Edwards.         ─ Uhuh.
You would photograph well.
─ Well, I'm kind of superstitious ..
About getting my picture taken.
A man who likes opera?
I'm much less worldly than you think.
Are you indeed?
"Do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike."
"Crossed the big mountain
with her lover, Ike."
"Two yoke of oxen, a big yellow dog."
"A tall Shanghai rooster,
and a one-spotted hog."
"Toodle-dang-fa-ta-do
diddle-dang-fol-do-day."
"They Reached a big desert,
and Betsy give out."
"Down on the sand,
they were rolling about."
"Ike in great terror
looked on in surprise."
"Saying: Betsy, get up.
You'll get sand in your eyes."
"Ike and Sweet Betsy attended a dance."
"Ike wore a pair of his
Pike County pants."
"Sweet Betsy was dressed
up in ribbons and rings."
"Says Ike: You're an angel,
but where are your wings?"
"Toodle-dang-fa-ta-do
diddle-dang-fo-do-day."
"A miner come up. Said: will
you dance with me?"
"I will you old hoss, if you
don't make too free."
"And I'll tell you the reason,
you want to know why?"
"Doggone you, I'm chock
full of strong alkali."
"Farewell Piper County,
farewell for a while."
"We'll come back again when
we've panned out our pile."
Where did you get this scar?
I got knifed in a saloon.
Why?
Oh, the men I worked with
didn't really need a reason.
And where did you get this ballerina?
Denver.
And this?
San Francisco .. it flies.
I uh .. I apologize for asking
you to do this Miss Flynn.
Particularly on Christmas morning,
but I'm afraid it's necessary.
Are they all dead, Corporal?
They're dead alright .. except
for the husband, of course.
He took off somewhere
after he .. did it.
They hate the cold weather. Every
year, one or two will suicide.
It's the first murder I've seen here.
He used a knife.
He must have taken it with him.
I don't see it anywhere. Do you?
It's a sad sight Corporal.
Damned Chinamen. Never understand
what's going on in their heads.
I wouldn't be too harsh on them .. you
know they're a world away from home.
Looks like he's slowing down.
Must have cut his throat back there.
─ Then he ran until he hit the fence.
I guess he saved us
the bother of a trial.
Good afternoon George.
─ Good afternoon.
Congratulations on your promotion.
─ Thank you.
That's really quite an accomplishment
for a man as young as you.
Thank you George.
There.
I guess the detachment
is being enlarged.
I'll have two men under me.
I'm sure you'll measure up to
your responsibility .. Sergeant.
It's a fascinating process.
─ Yes it is.
Move them along, Shorty.
There's a train coming.
Work training. That's the reason she
was running so close behind the others.
I tell you one thing. Robbing trains is
a lot easier than rustling horses.
What time we get back to that?
─ In the Spring.
We got to work our butt here all Winter?
─ Well, it's safe here in Kamloops.
Besides .. I'm getting to where
I kind of like this place.
Slaving away in that mine,
and rustling these horses.
We got all we need buried
under a rock down by the mission
Well .. we got to think
about the future, Shorty.
Let's get these horses.
I'm afraid you're mistaken .. if Miner
were in this area, I'd know about it.
Not necessarily .. he's
clever at false identities.
And this region is filled with people
who think of him as some sort of hero.
My opinion stands, sir.
Indeed.
I take it then, that you are experienced
in dealing with major criminals?
No, I am not.
This is my jurisdiction sir, and I'm not
obliged to take your word for anything.
I don't mean to condescend, Sergeant.
But I have pursued this particular
criminal for some time now.
And I know how cunning
and dangerous he can be.
Dangerous?
That's not what I've heard.
Now you sound like one of his admirers.
─ Not at all.
But I have more important
things to do ..
than cater to the whims of
an American detective agency.
Your Superintendent in New
Westminster does not agree with you.
Why didn't you simply show
me that at the beginning?
Coöperation is preferable
to coercion .. Sergeant.
What would you like me to do?
This is an accurate description of
Miner, provided by San Quentin.
Very well, I will circulate it.
No Sergeant .. we don't want
to set him running again.
I simply want you to keep an eye out
for anyone who matches that description.
And notify New Westminster
if you should spot him.
What is it, Sergeant?
Nothing.
He could be any number
of older men around here.
I'll wager you he is the only one
with a bluebird tattooed right here.
I don't recall seeing such a mark on
anyone, but I'll keep my eyes open.
Not for me, Sergeant.
For us.
We  on the same side. Are we not?
Move a little this way,
so I can see the stripes.
A little more.
There .. there .. that's perfect.
I apologize for the rush Miss Flynn.
But I'd like to get it
off to my parents.
Of course, I understand .. it's not
every day you become a Sergeant.
If I catch Bill Miner ..
I'll probably be kicked up to Inspector
before that photograph is ready.
Are you quite comfortable, Sergeant?
I beg your pardon.
─ Smile.
I'll have a print for you the day
after tomorrow. How's that?
That's fine.
The uh ..
The Pinkertons are certain
he's hiding out in this area.
Maybe even right here in Kamloops.
Well, I certainly hope you'll
catch him Sergeant.
Please don't move .. not an inch.
Sorry, Miss Flynn.
Do you really hope I catch him?
For your sake, I most certainly do.
A lot of people like him.
That's because he only
steals from the railway.
There .. I'm just about ready.
In a way, I hope I don't
have to arrest him.
It might make me unpopular
around here .. with some people.
Hold still .. give me a big smile.
He won't be difficult to recognize. Not
with a ballet girl tattooed on his arm.
Not another word, Sergeant.
So, he checked out of the hotel and
left town, huh?           ─ Yeah.
He drove off, after meeting with Fernie.
─ Well, we can quit worrying now.
You must be getting
soft in the head, Bill.
The Pinkerton man wouldn't be sniffing
around here unless he has your scent.
Well, that's a hasty conclusion.
It's time you moved on.
I .. I never knew you were
concerned about my safety.
I'm just trying to protect
my own situation.
Well, I can assure you I won't
do anything to harm that.
Kate.
Can I talk to you?
In two or three days .. I'm going
to be leaving Kamloops for good.
When we made our plans.
There was something I left out.
I never intended to tell you.
Ah .. I'm not the man you think I am.
And you lied about your feelings
for me too?         ─ Oh, no.
You mean more to me than anything.
You've got to believe that.
─ Are you quite sure?
No matter what else you think about me.
I've been thinking
about it all afternoon.
I've decided I'm .. quite sure too.
So the rest of it is
of little importance.
Then you know?
Talking.
Fernie.
I imagine he was .. giving
you a chance to leave.
Before he was forced to arrest you.
I went to the station.
And I reserved two tickets
on the Eastbound train.
Disembark in Winnipeg.
Then we make our connections to Chicago.
Or New York .. if you prefer.
I can't go with you .. not now.
It would just make it easy
for the police to find me.
Kate, listen.
I want you on that train. Go to Chicago.
─ Why?
I'll go someplace. I'll
throw them off my trail.
And when it's safe, I'll join you.
You will come?
─ You bet I will.
You do believe me?
I believe  you.
I was looking for you
a little while ago.
Oh, me and Louis just
shared a bottle at the stable.
What's all this here?
What's the point George? You
ain't never going to use it no more.
No?
Seems to me, all you want to do is
cozy up that picture-taking lady.
Since when did you become an expert
on affairs of the heart, Shorty?
The fact is, I'd say she's just about
made a gelding out of you.
You moronic little son-of-a-bitch.
I told you I'd tell you
when the time is right.
Now the time is right.
How much longer?      ─ An hour and ten.
─ What if it don't stop?
It will stop. They have to take on
water for the up-gradient.
I ought to go down to the
???? They're closing up.
Before you go, there is something
I have to tell both of you.
It isn't safe for me any
longer in Kamloops.
I'm not going back and .. I advise
that you don't go back either.
You're Bill Miner .. aren't you?
I am.
What are you two doing in here?
We're robbing this train!
What's up? Hose bust?
This is no hose bust, it's a hold-up!
─ Throw down your guns!
This is the baggage car.
We've cut the wrong car.
─ They all look the same in the dark.
Do you have any mail?
─ Some.
I want the box.
─ What box?
The Express Box.
─ It's on the car you left behind.
The Frisco pouch?
It doesn't come this way, sir.
─ Which way does it come?
Via Mission Junction, sir.
Is that registered mail there?
─ Yes, sir.
Put it on the table.
Is that the money package?
─ I don't know, sir.
What do you know?
Now you open it.
That may come in handy.
Let's go. I'm done.
What about this?
─ We don't need it now.
What is it?
─ ????
Hello there.
Mounties.
Good day.
Good day, sir.
We didn't hear you when
you slipped in on us.
I'm Sergeant Wilson.
North West Mounted Police.
I must ask you to identify yourselves.
You boys are kind of out
of your territory, aren't you?
I must ask you to identify yourselves.
I'm George Edwards, that's Shorty
Dunn .. and this is Louis Colquhoun.
What are you men doing out here?
Prospecting.
Prospecting?
Where?
Over there .. east of Douglas Lake.
Not north?
─ No sir .. east.
You answer the descriptions
of the men we're hunting.
Who might they be?
The train robbers. The ones who
robbed the CPR at Duck's Siding.
Do we really look like train robbers?
Those gold pans .. they don't
look much used, to me.
We're not panning .. we're
surveying .. and staking.
And .. this is the first we've
heard of any train robbers.
Nonetheless, I must take
you for the train robbers.
Look boys .. we're done!
You do that .. and I'll
blow your head off.
That was stupid.
You could have been shot in the head.
I wish to God I had been
shot through the head.
George, will you step out please.
My men treating you well?
─ Just fine.       ─ Thank you, sir.
This is Mr Seavey. He's a
Pinkerton agent. Important.
Hello Bill. I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.
The name is Edwards, sir.
George Edwards.
Is it indeed, sir?
Louis Colquhoun.
William Dunn.
William Miner .. also known
as George Edwards.
You have been tried and found guilty
of the crime of armed robbery.
This court sentences you as follows.
Louis Colquhoun .. fifteen years.
William Dunn .. twenty-five years.
And William Miner .. also
known as George Edwards.
You are sentenced to twenty-five years.
This court is now adjourned.
T-G
