Yeah
When did you turn recluse?
You and the Jew settled in?
The Jew's
a born
fuckin' householder
Scouts furniture in the fucking catalogues mornin' and night
The Mrs. Ellsworth's
a 10-day miracle
Up and about and up and fucking doing
Meets with fucking Hearst today, her and fucking Ellsworth,
that I'd have thought would have steered her fucking clear
Hearst's invite?
Lady's bright idea
I've pretext enough if you'd
have me call to dissuade her
Don't you get in the fucking middle
Jesus fucking Christ, Al
She might as well set herself afire
I can't imagine that cocksucker got to you
Or you're folding your fucking tent
The last shot ain't yet fired
Stage is coming
My God, look at Wu
Lost his mind in San Francisco
You think he married the nigger?
I'm talking about his suit
Mr. Blazanov!
Merrick!
Oh God
I am barely speaking to you
Who the fuck is that?
A shabby, shabby exit from Virginia City
No "Farewell, Jack."
No "By your leave."
Nothing
Did you notice I was being pursued?
Is that us over there?
That is we, my dear, yes
I will install us momentarily
Countess
I stay
till the costumes come down
Admirable
Only the most minimal of civilities
"Hello, how are you?"
"A bit warmer today than Tuesday."
last may be too forgiving
Aunt Lou!
Hey
Good to see you
Hearst's meals are about to improve
Come on in
Okay
Go away
Stay close to the Jew
If it's Ellsworth apprising you of the widow,
let him fucking continue and do likewise for me
That's more fucking like it
Very considerate of you
to come to me when I thought I was coming to you
As I was feeling well, I thought you'd agree the
exercise might be beneficial
Does your examination confirm my suspicions
as to how I'm feeling?
It does
You seem
fully recovered
I'm delighted to be recovered
And to find my own judgments reliable
I would, however,
advise against rushing back into things
Would any meeting between us be complete, Doctor,
until I'd had your counsel against something?
Have you finished taking
the medicine I gave you?
Implying what, Dr. Cochran?
I'm implying nothing, Mrs. Ellsworth
I'm putting a question to you
I disposed of the medicine you gave me, Dr. Cochran,
knowing I had a weakness for it,
without having finished taking it
I see
You seem incapable of
crediting me as a full and
normal person
I credit you as exactly that, Madam,
which is to say as having limits like the rest of us,
and  to urge upon you the humility
of not asking more of yourself
than is reasonable
And I'd add my observation
that refusal to make such adjustment
sometimes is symptom in women of an inadequate recovery from the rigors
you've just endured
You say this as my physician?
Yes
Not my reprover
or rebuker?
No
Then thank you,
Doctor,
and good morning
You ain't getting' no cobbler, Mr. Hearst,
till I get my hands on them boots
Uh, here they come.
Here they come
Not one spoonful till I got 'em clean
Filthy
It's frontier living out here, Aunt Lou
Where I go,
ain't no frontier
I bring some standards with me
Ah…
I miss Missouri yet, Aunt Lou
Wasn't the world peak of ripe back then?
Didn't even the birds seem
to sing different?
More like they meant it
More like they meant it
You  understand
I don't suppose you operate another pair in secret
You know I wouldn't fib
Then I'll brush 'em up directly
I got you living right here in the building, Aunt Lou
I wouldn't even think about any other arrangements
Mightly generous, Mr. Hearst
Mighty brave
Will you take a walk,
see the camp?
I'll take a walk as far as my kitchen
I should have known you'd say that
You want that peach cobbler, don't you?
I do for a fact
And they know downstairs who's boss
Is this here a rich place, Mr. Hearst?
Oh,
very, very rich, Aunt Lou
For pure scale,
maybe the richest find I've seen
Guess we can live without them birds then
The high points
of the fucking high points of your trip, Wu
Cause I won't be able to follow you anyway
Wu
San Francisco
You look like a fucking idiot,
if no one has yet conveyed to you the truth
Wu,
San Francisco,
Hearst
Yeah, you
in San Francisco,
collecting workers for Hearst
Ho
How soon, fucking Wu?
The many Chinks
in Hearst's employ?
Huh?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello!"
The many chinks here, huh?
How soon?
Ah!
"10-Day, Wu."
Clever cocksucker
You come back with more fucking English
Ho
Now once I get my ducks in order,
you
will give your information
to Hearst
in a sit-down,
so we can gauge
his attitude toward me
Wu,
Hearst,
"Swedgin."
And "Swedgin" must act as translator,
as he is the only one in camp
versed in both languages
Ho
Chung Kuo
Am I right or am I fucking wrong?
Chung-Kuo
Chung-Kuo, Heng-Dai
Heng-Dai
Heng-Dai, Chung Kuo
And I'll tell you when the meeting is, huh?
Welcome home, Wu
Mmm
It's arrogance,
nothing more to Goddamn less
Do not use profanity, please,
speaking to me
For  goodness sake
Apologizing for my language,
I ask you consider my meaning
It hardly seems arrogant to me to seek an equitable
and mutually beneficial resolution with Mr. Hearst
Then spare him that paper with your pretty ideas
Tell him your price for how much you'll sell,
because Hearst don't let his partners set policy
I  hadn't realized you were so intimate with his business methods
Please don't be smart with me
Not about this
"This,"
Mr. Ellsworth,
being the question of my mine?
Well, what in the hell else would it be?!
Excuse me
I will meet with Mr. Hearst
I'll be delighted
if you should choose to accompany me
Oh, I ain't one to miss a train wreck
Though if you cannot forbear from patronizing me,
I'd prefer you didn't come at all
All right, Mrs. Ellsworth,
all right
Empty
You sure you don't want me to work behind here, boss?
If I wanted you working behind here,
you'd be fucking working behind here
Fucking work over there
It occurs to me, Al,
as you and he are
so evidently well-acquainted,
the decent interval that
Mr. Langrishe is owed to make his domestic arrangements
I might spend hearing you talk of him
Ever wonder if you expressed yourself more directly, Merrick,
you might fucking weigh less?
I see no logic in that whatever
I don't want to talk of Langrishe
He makes me fucking nervous
On what account?
I can't say on what account
That type,
he type you don't know exactly how you feel about him
is who you're made nervous by
Young man!
Keeping the wolf away, I see
Jack
John Langrishe, sir
The operator has the manners of a pig
A. W. Merrick, Mr. Langrishe,
publisher of "The Deadwood Pioneer."
Ah!
Accounted for the halo I see above you
Shit blizzard's early today
He takes his tone with you as a familiar
Oh, we're well-acquainted, Mr. Swearengen and I
Mmm, new friends,
old campaigners
The infrequent bloody win
Always superfluous, bloodshed
The deeper damage is best
Ahh!
Candidly, Richardson,
as I imagine you foraging for berries and grubs,
and  flicking at insects with your sticky tongue,
I feel a certain dismay
What are you talking about?
You are to be discharged, fool
As, I suspect
in a wink of time,
once some stage from a different direction arrives
with my replacement, am I
What did we do wrong?
Your error,
surprisingly enough,
is not to be a grotesque
of inconceivable stupidity,
but that you are white and male
and not repulsively obese
As for my own,
I wonder if it lies in an excessive courtesy
and eagerness to please
Shoo, skunk. Shoo
Go, go
Mr. Hearst
Farnum, have you a moment for us to talk?
I do
I'd ask only that you be brief
and forbear from
false camaraderie
Come, Hearst
I've seen the Ethiop
Who indeed could miss her?
And even as she supplants Richardson,
what person, I wonder,
of what depraved exotic origin have you engaged
to take my place?
I hadn't thought of replacing you
Do you want me to?
The world begins to dance before my eyes
As for Richardson,
Aunt Lou will be taking his position,
but he can keep doing whatever else it is that he does
with no reduction in wage
What a surprising and gratifying turn
Paid through Tuesday
That one's paid through Thursday
Having secured your approval as to my hiring plans,
I wonder now
if I might elicit the information I came for,
which is in regard to Mrs. Ellsworth
I am abjectly at your disposal
For some time,
without the unseemliness of approaching her directly,
I have sought without success
to generate a connection with Mrs. Ellsworth
A haughty cunt
Formerly weak for dope
Most fundamentally a sexual peccant,
though I'm sworn against providing specifics
Now,
as it seems of her own volition,
Mrs. Ellsworth appoints to meet with me,
leading me to wonder what change in her situation prompts her approach
I will look into that, Sir,
vigorously and immediately
You don't know
I do not know at present
Just send her up when she gets here
I can seek the knowledge out
I can pursue it as a first priority
Just send her the fuck up
All right, Sir
And may I say…
how delighted I am our relation is to continue?
Why don't you see to your type?
Excuse me?
Type
Don't you use type to print out your words?
Uh, well,I'd hoped to secure from Mr. Langrishe
I want copious discourse between us, Mr. Merrick
Where shall I find you soon?
Well,  we could speak now if you wish
No, not now, young man
Not immediately
But soon
Very, very soon
Where is your lair,
that I may beard you?
My lair adjoins the Gem
Wonderful
I can be bearded there most hours
Fine
Thank you Thank you very much
Thank, uh, very nice to meet you, Sir
Ah, the camp is lucky to have you
Uh, no way, actually,
you would know that
Go on there, Merrick Get away
Oh, incessant and unrelenting,
exactly that type of banter
I'll just go out the front
You know, I could go out that way
but I
I'll
You're looking fucking well, Jack
It's the learning fucking nothing, Al,
that keeps me young
Please
I hope you'll forgive the disarray
I seem to feel a greater priority
about making space for myself than
adorning the space I've made
Refreshments?
No
I must say
I feel less the grown man just now
than a boy from Missouri
My Aunt Lou Marchbanks
has come to camp
Is your Aunt's visit a surprise?
No.
Heavens no, no.   I
expecting my stay to be brief,
I left her at other diggings
Your Aunt Lou prospects, too?
My Aunt's my nigger cook
I see
Wonderful, wonderful cook
And a tyrant, of course,
as the best ones always are
I quite quake before her
Do you?
About our conversation too,
wanting so awfully much we come to an agreement
Don't disappoint him,
being as he's 12 with his Aunt in camp
I've learned that we
shared time in the Comstock,
Mr. Ellsworth. I'm sorry we didn't meet
Whatever's toward what he wants
Not a flying fuck if it's true or how fucking soaked in blood
That talk serves no purpose
What talk to a murderer does?
I'd not be insulted in my own rooms, Mr. Ellsworth
Where shall we go for me to do it?
Will you be in this afternoon, Mr. Hearst?
There's bodies in here
I certainly can be
The walls are down to make room for 'em. I see every fucking one!
Perhaps we could speak later then
I will look forward to that
You don't look forward to nothing far as her,
you murdering cocksucker
You hear me?
I'm very glad to have met you
I recognize
perhaps as I never fully recognized before,
how profoundly you feel about him
I know him
I will present
my offer to him
You will not
I will not permit it
You
behave in his rooms
as virtually a maniac
and now assert your superior prerogative?
I forbid you, yes
Well, I suppose that settles it
I know him
May I ask you to collect Sofia
once you've seen me home?
Do you understand?
In ways you can't
Mr. Ellsworth,
you hardly need explain yourself to me,
your wife,
in the thoroughfare,
having once laid down the law
Hey
Look at me!
Talk to me
He said they come up in cage
The guard was behind Jory
The guard wait for air change
First breath from above, he push Jory to the wall,
catch his legs and cut them off.
He saw it?
Jory was organizing
That's why they push him to the wall
We're awful sorry
Get the fuck away from him!
Get out of here go ahead
Get on
Accident
Another friend, he says,
was shot 10 days ago in bar
At the Gem
The friend talked union too
Jory and him were in the bar when he was shot Now they're dead
Pasco says he'll be next
Tell them they can go
when they're done crying
Make them understand
I was only talking to him
Hole in the building's front wall
He can pop out at any moment
Hearst
I'd not have him see us together
Prudent
Ah,
bacon
Might have a bit of a human aftertaste
Lurid with Chinese
No one suggests a theater here
Only observing, turning you outward
Deen a ma na ha mo goh ya!
Eh, chon choy!
Whi nee fie!
Fie ne jowa!
Jow!
Boss of the neighborhood
Won a war to take over
One hopes you are his backer and not his tailor
You're the first I've fucking revealed this to
Fucking throbs all the way up
Goes with me to the grave
Yeah
You fucking tip your hat to everybody?
Everybody
Morning
We're low on our hardware, just doing the order
Dogs
For him to laugh at
while we chase our tails
I'm gonna write it up anyway
Hearst's phony fucking accident,
I'm gonna present it to him
and put him on notice
I'm
concerned about Mrs. Ellsworth, Trixie
If concerned means
"Is she using?"…
I don't think she is
I don't either
Then why'd you ask if she was?
I didn't
You just
took me for asking that
Ask the one you want to then
I'm concerned that her
temperament is
is labile
I guess that means she's talking through her cunt?
Her moods seem inappropriately variable
Saying "variable,"
I don't disagree
I said so myself this morning to somebody else
Did I fucking embarrass you, Doc,
hat you go so fucking red?
Don't throw a fit, Doc
Look, I'll put it out
This is new
This entire area
is recent
The Ellsworth house, the richest claim
next to Hearst, that woman
What sort of plays
does she favor?
Oh, Christ, she told me
and I fucking forgot
Goes through her men like Sherman to the fucking sea
This
can't remember who this fucking belongs to
And who does this fucking belong to?
Well, I guess this belongs to
fucking everybody
The Bullock house
Fucking Sheriff
Insane fucking person
The one at Swearengen's, too,
I'll put him on notice about
I'm gonna put him on notice about it all
Wouldn't be looking for anyone coming through the wall to deal with your Johnson
And don't you try fucking coming to my side either,
or your Jew head will be wearing that fucking dresser as a tiara
All right
We're supposed to read your mind,
understand what you fucking mean
I mean…
all right
Shut the fuck up
"Please don't smoke" means "I'm at death's fucking door."
You can smoke
I'd prefer…
if
you did it outside
You're a fucking idiot, anyways
Pus is a deeper yellow
Aw, cocksucker
What are you staring at? Fucking boot fits, huh?
Home base, young man
There's the whole fucking area on the other side
I'm quite worn out
I fucking started this job,
I'll fucking finish it
This motherfucker
Al…
It's not the first impression I'd make
Heartfelt thanks
With such disagreement among the statements, Mr. Bullock,
on what basis could an inquiry justifiably go forward?
I put you on notice, Mr. Hearst
I identify a pattern in these events
Unless some law is broken, Mr. Bullock,
whose sanctions you have power to apply,
why in fuck should I care
what pattern you identify or don't?
There is a sanction against murder
The man lost his legs in a shaft
It happens quite often
I now learn that your worker who died in the Gem last week
was killed by two of your guards
I defy you to prove that event,
about which the two of us have spoken,
was murder
Whereas, in the same saloon nine days ago,
two guards of mine, giving no provocation,
had their throats cut
with two others of my guards as witness
Certainly,the guards who survive
are capable of naming the killers
Shall I have them make complaint?
I put you on notice
Many new people are in the camp, Mr. Merrick
And a very eventful time we had during your absence, Mr. Blazanov
You and I will have much to discuss in our evening perambulations
Okay
Main line coil,
artificial line coil,…
new
armature lever,
separate battery,
supplementaries
All new contrivances
I was instructed about in Chicago
Without this many innovations,
differential duplex would no be possible
Differential duplex?
Can you speak in
a high voice,
Mr. Merrick?
I can speak in a low voice
Blazanov then will speak in high voice
Keep speaking on in your low voice while Blazanov
at the same time, speaks highly
Blazanov : This is duplex telegraphy
Merrick : From this point on, I shall speak in my low voice
Blazanov : Both messages sent at the same time…from the same office at different voltages
Merrick : Excuse me, but I can't understand you when we both talk at once
And recorded elsewhere by instruments with appropriate sensitivities
Well, I
I won't keep you from your work
Mr. Merrick?
I met a girl in Chicago
Oh,
yes?
Also for our…
perambulations
Hmm
Yeah
Seeing you on your balcony the other night, Mr. Tolliver,
taking in the life of the camp,
I thought maybe it was time we had a talk
I regret we have to meet in this environment, Sir
Not at all
No
Changes that have gone on here,
it's not the place I'd be seen in by you
I'm sure whatever changes you allude to, Mr. Tolliver,
will come clear from your behavior
Fresh start
How many men
would be grateful for that opportunity?
Do you have more you wish to do with that,
or shall I state my business?
Please,
state your business
Your letter from Mr. Wolcott
naming me as having knowledge of his misdeeds
A letter I mentioned to you, yes,
in a conversation I regret
or you would circulate the letter's contents
Exactly what I regret and now find reprehensible and why I thank God
that you take a new look at me
To this point, Mr. Tolliver,
you make no materially different impression
Still lying,
still bullshitting
I hope I'm not, Sir, but I
I can certainly understand why that would be
your material second impression
Shall I show you the letter from Mr. Wolcott that I have in my possession?
That's not necessary from my point of view
You tell me you've got it,
I believe you
Here it is
Will you compare it to your letter?
Verify its authenticity?
It's not necessary
Shall I read to you certain
pertinent sections on
Wolcott's assay of your nature
and likely behavior after his death?
is detailing your complicitous participation in the aftermath of his crimes
disposing of the bodies and so forth?
You have no letter from Wolcott, Mr. Tolliver
Let's say that's the case
I just did Let's hear you say it
I have no letter from Mr. Wolcott
Never did
I never did have one
You're a lying, blackmailing sack of shit
What do you want?
I want you to go to work for me
How was your walk?
I seemed to get around adequately
Seemed to get along with that dandy
Yeah, he's all right
Theater fella, huh?
Langrishe?
He's a fucking promoter of the first fucking quality,
I can tell you that
I don't go to plays
so I can't speak to his worth
as an actor
Ahh
Tuesdays…
he'll tend to have amateur nights
Been to plenty of those
Virginia City
Guy farted seemed near an hour
Well, that don't sound like no amateur
Bullock
Tell that Chinaman when I want admission to his meat locker,
it behooves him
to fucking cooperate
What did he do instead?
Said "Swedgin"!
and barred my way
Had you eyes to select your own cut?
Are you gonna fuck with me?
I had eyes for the Cornishman killed in here last week
I explained it to him,
and he Goddamn understood me
Did he mosey over to a corner,
lift up a fucking tarp?
Yeah, he went to the tarp
That's what the croaker was under
That's our nook in Wu's structure
Why Wu delayed cooperating,
he hadn't known the croaker was under there
His stupid suit so overcome me,
it slipped my mind to tell him
I want that body
I'll see Wu hands it over
Hearst just had another Cornish killed at his diggings for trying to organize
They're calling that one an accident
What makes you think
any good will come of confronting Hearst now?
Now is when he's killing people
What, you feel he'll leave off soon?
Tactics and timing ain't the issue
The hell you say
If his pigs get that body,
Wu is their next fucking meal
You make him understand
"Chez Ami"
"Cooperage"
I'm watering these kids' vegetables
We don't do the other anymore
Very good
Lovely building
Sturdy?
Get away now
I apologize
for the awkwardness
between you and my husband
My dear Phoebe,
Mrs. Hearst, like your Mr. Ellsworth,
while pleasantly conversable on most subjects,
find others not to suit her at all
Will you hear my offer, Mr. Hearst?
Of course
I am willing to sell to you
a 49% ownership in my claim,
in return for
and here…
of course, I am out of my depth
but
for the sake of beginning a negotiation,
I'll say
You would have an easement through my holdings for the
transport of your ore,
unqualified in any regard except that it not impede my mining operation
Naturally,
at a separate fee,
I would wish access to transport for my own
ore
Have you finished?
I have, yes
Your proposal is
thoughtful,
but I'm afraid I lack
the qualities that
minority participations require
As I said, these are the most
preliminary thoughts
A vulgar man would ask before preceding any further
if you would require him to produce his jackknife
and make himself a capon before you
What in my ideas
do you find emasculating?
I can offer no inside explanations, Mrs. Ellsworth,
as I am not a capon,
which details offend me and why
your proposal offends completely
It mistakes my nature absolutely
All right
Will you hear my counterproposal?
I think not, Sir
Do hear it, Mrs. Ellsworth
Let me name an amount to buy you out
I will not hear it, Mr. Hearst
Let me out
Shall I scream?
The hour makes the thoroughfare uncertain
Will you have an escort until your dear home's lights appear before you?
No
You are reckless, madam
You indulge yourself
Stand your watch. I'll
I'll get this part later
Everything fixed to your liking, folks?
Wonderful
Thank you
Have you supped sumptuously?
Actually, we have
I'm delighted
Countess?
Costumes were damp
Oh dear
Are you drying them?
You are, of course
I am tedious beyond bearing to ask
A newly rakish tilt
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph Company
Telegram for Mr…
"Langinshire."
Langrishe!
Langrishe
I am he
Telegram
Yes
Wait
Thank you
Very welcome
What did you give?
A dollar
Too much
Chesterton and Bellegae
are in transit from Cheyenne
Having "suffered the tortures of the damned"?
"Endured indescribable
inconvenience."
"The damned" was from Fort Kearney
I shall take the air
Shall I accompany you?
My destination is beneath you
At least something would be
Good evening
Good evening
Madam
Sir
Wonderful food!
We got fish and we got ham,
and don't pay no attention to the menu
The thought
I'd put into it,
all the time I took to write it out
and put it by and look again
I began to read to him my proposal,
but I I was more and more afraid
I was only
chanting sounds
Finally, I made myself look to him
to confirm that I was speaking intelligently and being understood
Now you know
He grinned at me
like a jackal
This is what I would have spared you
He scorned my offer
He said I
mistook his nature
absolutely
You did
Yes
And was there more?
After the jackal smiled?
It seemed
very possible that there could be,
but finally he let me go
He had restrained you?
I was very afraid
I can't say with any certainty exactly what was happening
What the hell do you mean?
Did you try to leave,
and did he prevent you?
Don't use that tone of voice with me
Well, I guess I know what that means
Oh, do you, Mr. Ellsworth?
That you're a Goddamn fool who almost go what she deserved
And what would that have been?
And why would I have deserved it?
I only wanted to protect you
You
can't
I wish you'd eat that outside, Mr. Hearst
I wanted to be sure you have all you need
And more besides
And now you done seen for yourself
I really don't care what others think of me, Aunt Lou
And you need only care what I think
God, I hate these camps
All this deferring and adjusting to other's
wrong-headed stupidities
I must have missed where they way better in San Francisco
They're not
They're worse
Can't bear San Francisco
Don't let Mrs. Hearst hear you saying that
Aw, she knows, she knows
She knows why I always leave so quickly
Goddamn truth is I'd rather be off by myself, Aunt Lou
Free to do my work
"Boy-the-Earth-Talks-To."
That's your Indian name
That's right, You remember
Only Goddamn conversation I care to have
Her telling me where to dig into her
Wonderful
Thank you, Sir
Haven't ate potatoes quite that smooth
I don't know if I ever had 'em that smooth
These elections can't be a joke
More tail-chasing for him to laugh at us about
Hearst
The offices have to count for something
How will you work that?
Laws
Jesus Christ!
Excuse me
Seems like one way more for his kind to run us
Laws do
Who will have strawberries?
I hope you'll take it as measure of my keenness, Sir,
and curiosity
Yes, yes, yes, Mr. Tolliver
You wish to know your duties in my service
Well, I make my way through the muck to learn the details
Your duties will be to answer like a dog when I call
Like a dog?
Complications of intention on your part in dealings with me
or duplicity
or indirection
behavior, in short, which displeases me,
will bring you a smack on the snout
Ouch
When administered by a practiced hand such a blow can be
more painful
and grievous even than your
recent sufferings
I don't doubt the hand would be practiced
Mr. Swearengen recently discovered as much
I gather
it cost him a finger
But I should say too that
in these rooms just this afternoon
such displeasure brought me near to murdering the Sheriff
and raping Mrs. Ellsworth
I have learned through time, Mr. Tolliver, and
as repeatedly seem to forget
that whatever temporary comfort
relieving my displeasure brings me, my long-term
interests suffer
My proper traffic is with the earth
In my dealings with
people,
I ought solely have to do with niggers
and whites who obey me like dogs
If he hadn't meant me to wag it, Sir,
why would the Lord give me a tail?
So
I make you my second deputy,
you clever little heathen monkey tongue
You stand there, Richardson
You're lucky for Aunt Lou
Don't shy away from a little noise now
Ah chung ow chi
See I speak your stuff
You savvy?
Clatter them Goddamn sparrows
"I love your cobbler like sunset, Lou."
And back-broke niggers in the fields
George Hearst…
do love his nose in a hole more,
and ass in the air,
and back legs kickin' out little lumps of gold
like a fucking badger
No more use for them nuggets, either
Past counting them up,
and saying that big number to astonish niggers
to remind us we in the world
Hah!
I seem to have won
That's the 13 orphans natural
Shall we clatter them motherfuckers again?
Strange affectations your devil friend has
Shabby appearance,
derelict hotel
Put the hole through that wall just before he worked on my hand
Americans…
it never occurs to them to try the window
I'll tell you the truth
I begin to wonder if I mightn't be fucking queer
You see more to admire in the male asshole than you'd…
realized hitherto?
That I haven't gone yet for Hearst's throat
Ambition
and the blessed simplicities of action
don't always quarter in comfort
I've no fucking ambition past trading
to my favor
and coming…
once a day
Bullshit!
A thing of this order
you'd as soon not see ruined
or in cinders
I will if I fucking have to
Avoiding it
if I could
Good night, Al
Good night
Few enough
I find tolerable
Lucky our paths have crossed again
Don't misinterpret that
All right, Jack
