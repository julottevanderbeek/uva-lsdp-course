For centuries in
the jungle of Parané...
...the inhabitants performed rituals to
invoke beings from the river's current...
...who could help them
in case of an invasion.
Today, those who work this same
land as a means of subsistence...
...still resort to those rituals
when a threat is near.
THE BURNING
India?
Gathering water.
Go get her.
She killed herself.
She hanged herself a while ago.
The branch held her weight.
The tiger jumped at her.
And then the branch broke.
There's no need to bury her.
C'mon, let's go.
Alone?
Just me.
Good.
Come with me.
Morning.
Joao, the farm's owner.
Joao, at your service.
Did you see them?
They will come.
Yes, we know.
Good.
Morning, my child.
Morning.
Yesterday, the hills were
burning until nightfall.
If you came by the river
perhaps you saw it.
Last week, they did
the same over there.
Three days earlier,
they got very close.
Very close. Less than
a kilometre away.
From this spot,
we could see the flames.
It wasn't like this before.
We knew, every once in a while,
that there was a hidden fire...
...because of the smell
or the smoke. But...
This is different.
They want it all.
But not for themselves.
They've always been nomads.
These neighbours that had
the farm past the creek...
...tried to confront them. They
were kicked out with shotguns.
They burned their property.
They had to leave.
They had to leave.
I made it today.
You are lucky, we don't
always have some.
I brought you this.
We've seen it before.
They burn it all.
They bring pines and soy...
And all of this is wiped out.
Besides, they want to set up
a processing plant here.
They came to talk to me.
It's perfect for them because
it's near the river. But no.
I came here with
my father in 1970.
We busted our asses working!
We managed to buy
this after ten harvests.
I met my wife here.
I raised my daughter here.
You belong here.
May I help you?
Yuca needs to be peeled.
I'm sure he'll help us.
Nobody's going to
kick us out of here.
What happened?
Down!
Jara?
Jara!
Come!
No, please!
Easy...
Be quiet.
The deserter.
Look where he was.
We'll leave.
We will. But please...
Please...
I don't want you to leave, sir.
I want you to sign.
What's this?
It's a bill of sale.
You sign it, you live.
You don't sign it...
Dad.
Look inside.
Take it easy...
Walk.
There's always a woman.
Vando, take her.
I'll sign.
Don't sign, Dad.
Don't sign!
Either you sign...
or I out off her head.
One or two, it's the same.
Sit.
Drink.
She won't cook today.
Tomorrow she will.
Vando... She's yours.
Drink.
No!
First, you kill a raccoon...
A fox...
Then a boar...
Then a man...
You leave the tiger for last.
You have many things left to kill.
Come here...
No, no!
I buried your dad
next to the house.
And Jara?
He'll be fine.
With time.
He's alive?
Yes.
We need to move on.
Last night I saw
the jaguar. The tiger.
He almost ate me.
I had never seen him so close.
He's beautiful.
He's got nowhere to go.
That's why he roams around here.
These people will kill him.
We shouldn't be here.
Why did you hide when they came?
You didn't help.
They were going to kill us all.
I've seen the older two before.
You know them?
Yes.
It's not just these three.
There are more.
When they come back,
they'll be more.
Our little brother is a grown man.
A while ago I saw my father do
the same thing you did.
When I asked him about it he said...
"I'm asking for help".
Two days later, you arrived.
I also lost my house.
When they burned
our farm, upstream.
But that was a while ago.
Everyone in my family disappeared.
Nobody could live elsewhere.
Even I tried to live in town
but I couldn't.
When I saw what we became there.
So I returned to the jungle.
Those who live here taught me
how to belong to this place.
I've had the feeling I had to swim
down the river for a long time.
When I arrived at your farm I realised
why the current brought me here.
It was you.
But none of that matters now.
Why not?
The current has changed.
Come! Here!
C'mon, c'mon!
Quiet!
Tulio, let's go!
The rest of you stay!
It's alright.
Hold on.
Do I do it?
It's ok.
Ready, my friend.
Now rest for a while.
I remember you.
I guess it's not
from the sawmill.
I haven't seen you there.
You were with them.
Awhile ago...
...they sent me to
check out this place.
They wanted to see whether
this was an easy job or not.
To determine how
to handle Mr. Joao.
They had already spoken
to Mr. Joao but he...
...he didn't want to sell.
They've been wanting this
land for a long time now.
But when I got here...
I saw this place...
I saw her.
I realised that all of this
shouldn't disappear.
That I wanted
to stay and help.
We must get ready.
They are approaching slowly now.
But they'll be here soon.
How many?
Eight.
All armed.
Well...
There are three of us.
Two wounded.
And the uninjured one is a woman
who's never shot a gun before.
But you were with them.
That should help.
I suppose.
They are hunters.
That's the main thing we
should keep in mind.
They won't come in together.
Two of them will come
from that side...
Three others from that one.
And the rest will spread
out near the river.
They'll probably
come two at a time.
Especially if they
believe there's danger.
They'll try to shoot us
from a distance at first.
Then come and set fires next.
We should be careful of bombs.
I think our best bet...
...is to try to confuse them.
Obscure their vision.
So they can't signal each other.
So they have to make noise, talk.
While we try to hide.
To hide is not enough.
We must defend ourselves.
I have an idea for that.
Come with me.
To defend ourselves is not enough.
Vania is right.
You know that, don't you?
Tulio, go with Hacha and Domenico...
To the main house.
If you see them, shoot.
If you don't, set fire.
You, to the right.
Prepare the bombs
before you enter.
Let's go.
I can't see them! I can't!
Relax.
My brother and I have
unfinished business here.
You're done.
Go.
Can you do it?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Over there!
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be okay.
YOU?
We'll be fine.
It would be good
if you stayed around.
The people who sent
them will send more.
I'll be around.
