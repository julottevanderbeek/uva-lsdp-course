It's a story about animals.
The story took place in a barren land.
I hate to bring up about animals...
...but one of my high school teacher...
...always loved about telling
a story on ancient monkeys.
He said there were two monkeys...
...in order not to be eaten by tigers...
...while they are picking up peaches,
they decided to cooperate.
First monkey would go up and pick,
the second monkey looks
out for the first monkey.
In return, the first monkey would
give half of the food to the second monkey.
However, the sentry monkey
could never leave it's duty.
It requires those two monkeys...
...should never only think about itself.
As a result,
those two monkeys become
a group of monkeys.
This group of monkeys become human beings.
Our story starts with this bird.
Ay!
Give me a cigarette.
Do you know Muhammad?
He's an Arabian prince.
I hunted this falcon for him.
Cost him a million RMB.
See, you take half of the money...
...and let me go with the other half.
Sounds good?
Ok, never mind.
It's all yours if you're letting me go.
Keep talking.
Hello. Do you hear things?
Hello!
You are good person,
but good things don't always
happen to good people!
Hey!
Are you nuts?
You almost ran me over!
Brain-dead asshole.
I tried to reason with him.
Hey, say something!
Hey.
Is there anyone?
Hey, what's going on?
We're fucked...
...there's only one road out...
...and both sides are gonna be blocked.
We can't run out of this.
Take the falcon and just go.
I'll call the police.
When I become a lawyer,
I recall the monkey story.
And I just want to tell my teacher,
humans are not really humans...
...until they learned to use fire,
not because they abandoned selfishness.
Hey! Come here!
The car is broken!
Hey hey hey, let's go!
Hi, greeting!
Hello.
I'm Pan Xiao.
We've spoken on the phone.
I pretty much understand your situations.
There are two more questions I need to ask.
Do you think you could handle this?
There are two things I'd like to mention.
First of all, I took ten
hours train to here.
But what I didn't know is to arrive here, I
have to take another 3 hours horse carriage.
I am not asking for money,
I am talking about opportunity cost.
We can always earn more money,
but when times gone, they're gone forever.
Do you think you could handle this?
Please, listen to me first.
Consider this a new habit,
because we're gonna do the
exactly thing on court. OK?
Secondly,
your case is kind of complicated.
I can't know for sure that we could win.
Therefore,
the payment of the remaining
fund is important.
It seems you can handle this.
When I am going back, I am not gonna
take horse carriage anymore right?
I never loved animals.
I especially hate horses.
It's clear what happened.
The defendant murdered a police officer...
...while poaching protected birds.
The prosecution rests.
Will the defense please begin?
Thank you, Your Honor.
We don't hear a single word...
...from my defendant on this tape.
So, I don't understand what
this so-called evidence...
...has to do with my client.
I'll show you!
Altai falcon feathers were in the vehicle.
I suspect...
You say you "suspect" you "think"...
...but that's not enough.
The law requires proof.
What you're providing are clues, not proof.
Let me demonstrate "proof".
Officer Wang,
on the day of the crime,
did you have lunch with the victim?
Yes.
Did you consume alcohol?
I don't remember.
I present to the court...
...the receipt for the meal.
Officer Wang ate with the
victim at Dafudi restaurant.
It has your signature.
Thank you.
You ordered roasted lamb...
...one bottle of Songzhuang liquor,
and four bottles of beer.
Quite a lot of alcohol.
So, we can only conclude...
...that your consumption of alcohol...
...was the direct cause of this accident.
And Officer Wang, frankly,
you're an indirect cause of this tragedy.
Say that again!
You know very well what happened that day!
I've had enough of your bullshit!
Objection! Your honor.
This is personal attack!
You're a good lawyer,
and a friend I'd like to make.
I'm sorry,
my liver has some functional disorder.
That's why I don't drink.
If you're satisfied with
the results of the case,
let's make the best of our time...
Well, let's wrap this up.
I'll wire the rest of your money...
...into your account within ten days.
C'mon, you shouldn't screw with lawyers.
It's ten days.
Do you know how much
effective time people have in their lives?
Outside of sleeping,
eating, and bullshitting,
It comes out to a little
over 100,000 hours.
And you actually want me to wait 10 days.
That car.
Do you see it?
It's a little too red, isn't it?
My wife liked it.
I went away on business this year...
...and when I came back,
I heard she'd had an accident.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
But I bought the color anyway.
Because I promised her I would.
So, rest assured.
People like me...
...intend to keep the promises.
How much is your car worth?
It seems your wife doesn't
need it anymore huh?
So you should leave me
the car as collateral.
You can't have...
...the car.
Really?
Look here.
I've signed this receipt.
It proves that
I bought this bottle of alcohol.
But who can tell...
...that I actually have been drinking?
So.
You really want the car huh?
Here. Sign.
Do you believe...
...I ran into that police car...
...intentionally?
Or not?
Sorry.
That's outside of my
professional competence.
You're a good lawyer.
Thank you.
Hey, pal!
There's only one road out
of this place, right?
That's what it looks like.
I need to see your license.
Name?
Pan Xiao.
Occupation?
I thought you knew?
Answer the question!
Lawyer.
Can I go?
You only lost a conviction.
Is it worth the anger?
I swear to god...
...if I weren't a cop, I'd kick your ass.
Too bad you're a cop.
Thank you sir.
What the fuck are you?
The merchandise is on the move.
We can't afford another delay.
Think of something.
I know.
Hi, Michael.
- It's me.
- Mr. Pan.
- We're gonna make a big scene tomorrow.
- Not a problem!
Have you invited media for
the book release tomorrow?
Yes, more than 30 of them.
Well, invite more.
- The more the better.
- The costs' gonna be much higher!
We gotta take this big.
Fame and fortune are two related brothers.
Fame brings fortune...
...and you can't buy fame
without the fortune!
The second thing is write
up something for the press.
What's it gonna be?
You don't even know this?
Ay ya!
Famous lawyer went to a
distant border area...
...and won justice for a
wrongly accused man.
What about the content?
Our legal wire reports...
...not long ago...
...our journalist...
...has had accompanied with
famous lawyer Pan Xiao,
whose English name is Sean Pan,
been to the no man's land
in Northwest rural China.
Hello?
Get down here!
Get down here now!
Wipe it off!
Can't talk to you!
I forgive you this time.
That's gonna be the most
expensive slap of your life.
What are you doing?
Hey, get back in the truck...
...both of you!
You hear me?
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey!
"Hey"what, boy? "Hey" what?
C'mon, sanitation! You
can't just pee anywhere!
Hey, buddy, this time...
...we'll let you off.
Pieces of shit...
Fuck you!
I'll let you off this time!
Hurry up!
Ay!
Hey.
Ouch.
Are you fucking blind?
What's the matter?
Hey, comrade. Hey, are you cold?
I'll close the windows.
Calm down. Deep breaths.
There's a rest area up ahead.
There'll be people.
You'll be alright. We'll be alright.
Hey, pal?
Buddy?
Ay.
I need to make a phone call.
Boss, fill it up.
Need me to fix your car?
No, just fill it up.
You sure? Your car ain't
looking good to me.
No repairs. Thanks.
How much?
One thousand five hundred yuan.
How much?!
One thousand five hundred yuan.
It's just a tank of gas.
Really.
One thousand five hundred yuan.
Man.
Don't you think that's a little overpriced?
There's another gas station down the road.
Four hundred and ten kilometers that way,
you can't miss it.
So, pal, what you're
doing here is extortion.
Extortion?
We don't like that word around here.
What we do is affiliated marketing.
You understand?
What?
Our rule is...
...before you buy gas,
we have a little dance show...
...that you go in there and watch,
it's pretty sexy.
The show is 1,200, gas is 300.
I'd say 300 a tank is reasonable.
Wouldn't you?
OK. Fine.
One thousand five hundred yuan, then.
But I don't need to see the show.
No show, no gas.
Otherwise I'd just be...
...ripping people off.
You get in there and have your fun.
You'll be smiling when you come out.
Right?
Just go.
Don't be surprised!
Ok.
I'll go in.
I'm going in.
Hey,
Zit.
Fill it up.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hmm.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
You actually want to see the show?
Fine, then that's an extra 100.
Stop it!
Could you please stop it!
I'm sorry.
You don't need to do anything.
Here's 200, Ok? Take it.
I just came to get gas,
I need to go.
Come on, put on your clothes.
Go, go sit over there.
- Mister...
- What?
Mister, y'know.
This is my first time turning tricks.
If I don't the boss beats me.
Mister, please don't arrest me.
I'm telling you the truth.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
I'm not a cop,
now get up.
You're not a cop?!
Then what the hell are you looking at?
I'm watching my car, Ok?
If you people didn't do this
"captive market" thing...
I wouldn't be here at all.
So, handsome.
Where are you going, anyway?
Home.
Did you like my dancing just now?
I'm telling you the truth.
I used to be in that...
...that Shanxi Art Academy.
Really. Do you believe me?
Look,
look! And look!
Get up!
Do you know how I got here?
They lied to me...
Get up, get up!
Mister...
...help me, Ok?
Take me with you.
Just help me out, Ok?
I'll give you 100, take it.
- What are you doing?
- It's my fare.
- Don't be polite, Take it.
- Why..why are you giving me money?
This is your money. This is your tip.
- Keep it, I can't help you.
- Don't be like this sir.
- Just take it!
- I can't help you!
I...
So what'd she say?
Was she an artis or a
ball player this time?
Damn little bitch you wanna run again?
You can't run with...
...broken legs!
You wanna run...
Hey, look, just talk to her, Ok?
Don't hit women.
I'll deal with you in a second!
Here, 1,500.
That's not enough.
Get this off my car, I don't want it!
Get off! I don't want it!
It's cold, you'll freeze
to death without glass.
I didn't tell you to fix my car!
Hey, Zit, fix the headlight too!
Hey, no!
No!
Don't fix my car,
don't, don't!
Fine.
Forget the headlights.
Three thousand yuan.
What a guy.
Don't leave no trace.
God bless me, God bless me.
Hey, boss.
Fill me up.
Here, 1500.
It's 1,500 for the gas, alright?
My gas line leaks, Ok?
Take it!
So you like her, huh?
Zit,
give him some gas!
A lighter.
One hundred yuan.
Wait a minute...
...you still owe me 50.
What 50?
So I don't say anything.
Look,
all I have.
Keep it secret.
Nobody hears about you and the girl.
I won't say a word.
Thank you. Thank you very much!
You're such a wonderful person.
I said I let you off,
and then you burned my truck.
Ah?
What's going on?
Why the fighting?
This asshole set my truck on fire.
Is the gas Ok?
You burn my truck?
What's on your mind?
You want blow me up?
I got no money,
if I did you'd have it.
You got no money and you
burn my fucking truck!
Get up!
Stand up!
Straight!
Man.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
I apologize!
Sorry's not good enough.
I'm gonna remodel your car...
Hey.
Hey what?
Hey, hey.
Hey what?
Brother.
Let's see how far you can run!
Bro, he fucking bites.
Hurry up.
What the..., you fucking idiot?
You let him bite you?
Go get him, that way!
Get him!
Take the bat.
Don't run.
I told you, you're not going anywhere.
People are capable of doing anything.
When they are in extreme danger,
it's so called animal instinct.
So where are we anyway?
What happened to your face?
Get out!
Hey, hey that hurts!
Get out!
You're hurting me!
My stuff is still in the car...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Mister, please, I'm begging you...
...don't leave me here.
Go home!
Look, I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not from the dancing academy.
My family is in Hebei.
They sold me to a trafficker for 20,000,
and then he married me to that asshole.
You think I'd marry him?
And he makes me work to pay him back.
You go back right now.
I'm not lying.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Really!
Go back.
Get out!
How do you expect me to go that far alone?
- Please, just get out of there.
- Can't you rescue me?
- Get out, then we'll talk.
- No!
- Save me, please?
- We discuss it when you get out.
Please, I can't go back that far alone.
Open the door! Open the door!
Open the door!
Ahhh, just open it.
Open it!
Mister, look...
I'll tell you the truth,
I do okay here,
There's no competition,
the boss likes me...
it's alright.
Alright, I won't disturb you.
I'm leaving now.
Burglary...
...for a large amount, 3-10 years.
Battery...
...if aggravate dis also 3-10 years...
...plus punitive compensation.
Bigamy...
...bigamy is section 258... right,
Two years in jail, minimum 2 years.
I'm really a lawyer.
Do you believe me?
You don't believe me.
You don't believe me at all!
Let me ask you something.
Did you smell gasoline?
So you think...
...I poured gasoline on him?
No, no.
I didn't think that, not that...
You're lying!
That's what you thought!
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I believe you.
Don't say you believe me when you don't.
- You have to believe me, really!
- I do,
- I believe you deep down my heart.
- I really believe you, really.
Help! Help! Help!
Hey what are you doing?
Are you nuts?
Help!
You fucking crazy?
Help!
What the heck you are doing?
Help!
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Don't kill me, Mister!
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Don't kill me!
Don't touch my money!
You monster!
Don't touch my money!
You asshole! Don't touch my money!
- Don't move, listen!
- Don't touch my money!
Listen to me!
This is my bank card,
take it.
There's 200,000 in the account,
the password is the account number.
I don't want it.
You can have it all.
Do you understand?
You can have all of it.
I don't want anything.
If you want the car you can take it.
I don't want anything!
Go!
Just Go!
Just leave me alone, Ok?
Just leave me alone!
My career comes to the end.
So is my life.
Hey, Mister. Don't be like that...
All the media were gonna be there...
And I was gonna make the headline news...
Now...
Ha, I guess I'll make headlines anyway.
What's so great about being famous?
If you weren't so worried about it,
...you wouldn't be afraid right now.
You have 200,000.
Two hundred thousand?
Doesn't do me anything.
In two years I've only saved 20,000.
And I know just what I'm going to do.
There's a little place
in Jiuquan called Anxi.
Nobody knows me there.
I'm going to rent a place in town,
install some mirrors...
...and maybe start a dancing
school or something.
Didn't you say you were from Hebei?
Listen...
In this industry...
...if the first thing out
of a girl's mouth is,
"I'll tell you the truth,"
then the rest isn't the truth.
Just like my industry...
You know what, Pan Xiao,
you know what I think?
You could open a boutique store.
- Hire some people, rent a place...
- Go, just go!
Or drive a taxi?
You could buy a car...
Oh good god,
- Pan Xiao.
- Just go!
- I told you is true.
- I need some time to think, Ok?
Hey, you're not dead!
You're not dead!
How could you...?
Ha! That's fantastic!
He's not dead,
...and if he's not dead I'm fine!
Hey buddy, you scared the crap out of me!
I mean, oh my god, you...
This whole thing is just a bad joke...
I'm not dead, what about you?
This guy...
So where is he?
One hundred.
He got in a fight here...
...and then took our girl away.
We're looking for him right now.
Then did you see...
...if he had a falcon with him?
How would I know?
Wait a minute.
I'll need another 50...
...if you want me to keep this secret.
You're a falcon dealer?
You're smart.
Hey, there's one more favor I need.
Open the back seat...
...and pull on the rope.
There's something in there I need.
Good, fantastic.
The falcon's Ok, anyway.
Alright,
then you...
...you have your stuff...
...and...
...and you have your car...
...park right here...
I gotta go,
take care.
Mr. Pan.
Don't be such a rush.
We still have some things to talk about.
Let me ask you something.
If a man
had his car broken,
and he waits by the road for help,
has that man done something wrong?
No, nothing.
Nothing?
Then why did you run into him?
His leg was broken,
blood flowed...
Ay.
Why did you do that?
I didn't do it on purpose.
He didn't do it on purpose.
And when you hit him,
why didn't you take him to a hospital?
I thought...
...I thought you were dead.
Is that man dead?
No?
Why did you pour gasoline on that man?
You're a very bad man.
Do you realize that what
you've done is serious?
Do you realize how it impacts society?
OK.
Get the tube from the car.
Go!
Now suck the gas out.
Why?
Pour it out.
Pour it on your head.
Good, good, good.
Put it down.
Get away from the car...
You're terrified, don't you?
How is it?
The smell isn't so good, is it?
No, it's not.
Not good,
no good to smell.
I've got gas on me,
and my leg is hurt.
We're even, alright? We're even.
You're all fucked up now.
Hey,
we should get you to a hospital,
your leg doesn't look good...
before it's too late.
Oh, so you love him?
Okay,
you wanna go with him?
Hey, slut,
feel his pocket, see if he
has a lighter in there.
Mr. Pan?
It isn't a clue,
it's proof, right?
Come on,
light his hair!
Light it.
You don't want him to die?
What about you? Do you wanna die?
Light it!
One...
Two...
Hey, there's that fucker.
Help!
Run!
Do you know a village called ErDao Liangzi?
This won't work,
I told you.
He's got a gun.
Yeah?
I've got a truck,
I'm gonna hit the bastard.
Hey, calm down!
We should get outta here
and call the cops.
We should call the cops.
Man, you don't know,
I'm a lawyer...
So what?
You caused all this!
You brought him out!
My brother's dead because of you.
Fuck off!
Suddenly I realized that...
...now...
...I was that monkey.
I was placed at the dog-eat-dog world,
and you know what's more pathetic?
Nobody's under the tree looking out for me.
Oh, I forgot about you are vegetarian.
What do you want for me?
Friends,
should help each other.
We...
...are not friends.
We are different!
You don't know yourself.
You write your own damn book,
I smuggle my own damn falcon,
we had the same goal.
I believe,
we...
...are still different.
Take it.
You could call the police.
So,
I could help you to find
something you want,
you take me our here.
Mister...
Don't do this to me!
I can't drive!
What the hell's wrong with you?
I was not meant to do it.
Are you trying to kill me?
Yeah, you're tough...
...kidnapping my woman??
Who the hell are you?
Where's the guy in the suit?
Who are you?
How many idiots am I gonna meet today?
Come here!
Leave me alone.
What are you doing?
Nice knife.
Come on, stab me.
What's this?
Oh, it's a gun.
You're hardcore.
Is that a hammer?
Come here and smash my head in,
do it!
Come here!
You really are a fucking idiot!
You almost got me killed!
Get up!
You're playing around with guns huh?
Where were you going?
My hands hurt.
Take off my ropes, Ok?
My falcon?
Where's my falcon?
His dad took it.
You know him.
Get in.
Don't.
She's a girl.
Just let her go.
Friend do this thing for me, Ok?
Hello? 110?
I saw a hit and run...
...on Yanbai Road, a red car.
Come as fast as you can.
You! Why did you do that?
Friends...
...are gonna help their friends.
I'll give you this,
just don't kill him!
Don't take her money...
...you don't deserve it.
Give it back.
You poisoned by carbon monoxide.
Water will make you die faster.
What's this about?
He took the girl.
He's gonna kill her.
The falcon dealer.
I don't think he's going to let her go.
You think?
That's not enough, is it?
The law demands evidence.
Do you have evidence?
Do you?
You don't?
Well, I do.
I've got the suspect.
It's on maker 320 send a car.
No, wrong way!
U-turn.
Erdao Liangzi!
You have to get to Erdao Liangzi!
Or she'll die!
You've been poisoned.
Save your thoughts.
Ignore the voices in your head.
Get some rest.
I'm sorry, sir!
Wake up,
wake the hell up!
Hello? Police.
Hello, I gotta report to you,
Erdao Liangzi!
There's been a kidnapping, possible murder,
and poaching of protected birds.
Ah?
Ahya! God, he's a murderer!
Hey, know anybody who buys falcons?
Anyone?
Just like I told you,
the goods are here.
When did you go from being a falcon...
...poacher to a hitman?
- Does that scare you?
- Me, afraid...
My entire life, I go
abroad every other week.
I had a deal in tens of millions.
But I don't kill people.
Here's the money.
You get it after you clean up down there.
Drag it out.
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Well, what can I say?
You can't keep doing this.
Do you think you are eating buns?
One after the other one?
You should stop doing it.
Did you hear me?
Do it!
Hey, you...
Fine fine fine.
If you don't want to listen to me,
then do whatever you want.
I say I'm abroad now.
I didn't hear or see anything.
I don't know anything about it.
What plans?
What? I'm in China.
My wife wanted me to get her something.
Wait a bit longer.
Micheal, call the police.
Where are you?
There are 800 people waiting for you!
Erdao Liangzi!
Call the cops! Call the cops!
Erdao Liangzi!
Hurry up, call the cops!
What police?
Hurry it up!
Call the police!
- You think you made a fool of me?
- I know.
- This is you, your career! Are you aware of that?
- God dammit, I know!
- Keep the whole page on paper for me!
- Fuck, I know.
Hello?
Say something! Hello?
Can you hear me?
- Mr. Pan.
- Hello? Keep going.
Everyone is here, the media,
leaders all waiting for you.
Then just wait.
What about the under table money?
Don't hand out a cent if I don't show.
- Do you hear it?
- Ok.
You tell me.
- Are you done?
- No.
I've got a big case to handle here.
Bye.
You dig everyone out!
Who the hell are you?
You could never die huh.
Shut up, listen to me.
Think about why I released you.
I was trying to give you a second chance!
Your sentence just got a lot harsher!
But what you did is kill more people.
Your sentence just got a harsher!
You stand still.
What are you doing?
Bullshit. There's no cops.
Just you?
And you want to stop me?
You must think I'm an idiot...
..."divide and conquer".
I think you forgot something.
You are really an idiot!
Let me tell you some truth,
cops are gonna be here in minute.
Get in his truck,
and push redial on his satellite phone.
See if they're coming or not.
He called the cops!
Don't move!
No wonder you're so late.
You backstabber!
You are a idiot!
I'll fucking kill you!
Wait.
What?
I need the proof!
Run.
I'm fine.
Run.
Split, run!
Get up! Come on!
Get up!
What's this?
You're a bloody wreck.
Go. There's a first-aid kit in the truck.
Have a cigarette!
Smoke!
It won't kill you!
Don't throw lighters around anymore, Ok?
Tell you what,
this time I'll let you...
let her go.
Hurry up, get out of here!
You go first.
Just go!
Go! Get up.
Get the fuck up!
I can't run anymore.
You should run.
Tell the world what was going on here.
Get the fuck out!
Why?
You are alive,
why you came back?
You think you could save her by yourself?
You'll never understand.
We have nothing in common.
You are an animal.
Sure.
You are vegetarian.
I am carnivore.
You should watch her die first.
How could I not recall anything?
What's the teacher's name?
Let's call him "Teacher monkey".
I still want to tell him,
that I was absolutely right.
The biggest difference
between a man and an animal,
is we learned how to use fire.
Tomorrow I could make the headline.
I was looking at that bird.
Why does it fly that high,
risking its life for...
...a mouthful of food?
I'm like that bird.
Those years in no-man's land...
...were wasted ones.
Nobody treats me like...
...I'm a human being, not even myself.
That truck driver who saved me,
looked at me on the way,
starring,
said nothing at all.
I was then thinking,
I'm gonna do something and
make people be proud.
It's all over.
So, in the future,
are you leaving again?
No,
I'm tired.
I just want to stay here.
To find,
find a real job here.
I've been gone for so long...
I don't even have any friends left.
- Hello, Mrs. Xing.
- Hello, class.
I need to start class.
You wait here, Ok?
Get your clothes off,
get ready.
- What's wrong with Shi Hanyu?
- She's sick today.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Don't shout! Don't shout!
Come on everybody.
Come on now, 2nd formation.
Let's get started,
alright?
Everybody hold hands,
back up a step.
Is everyone's arm straight? Yes?
- Good. Come down.
- Yes.
Turn right.
Good.
First hand position, get ready.
Get set.
Inhale! Exhale!
Stretch! Stretch! Stretch!
Right!
Breath.
Keep it up! You two.
Good.
Two two three four,
five six seven eight.
Mind to breath.
Right!
Open!
Right!
Hold your breath.
Put it down.
Come here, Maomao.
Show it to everyone.
Pay attention everyone!
Don't forget what we just learned!
Knees straight!
Fantastic!
Li Yuxin!
You studied dance after that, right?
Professional dance?
No problem.
Come on.
Bring those mats over here for me.
What are you two doing?
Have you stretched your back?
Don't just stand there, get moving!
Put them on the floor.
You'll be my assistant from now on.
Try to keep up, okay?
Children!
This is Mrs. Li, our new teacher.
Everyone say hello to Mrs. Li.
Hello! Mrs. Li.
Well, don't just stand there talking!
Give me splits!
Splits!
You too.
