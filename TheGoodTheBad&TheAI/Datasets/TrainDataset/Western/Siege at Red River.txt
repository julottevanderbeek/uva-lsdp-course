Hi, Jim.
- Good morning, Mr Watson.
Not a move, Yankee!
Being nursemaid to the Gatling gun
is not my idea of fighting.
Let's not advertise
what we're carrying.
Sorry.
You got a spare one?
Thanks.
Extend your leave and watch
them test the gun at the arsenal.
Waste of time.
Crazy man's dream.
No gun will shoot 200 shots a minute.
Two hundred and fifty
and Dr Gatling is far from crazy.
I think they're gonna work.
Maybe change the whole
pattern of future wars.
This one if the Rebs get it.
All set?
- Yes and make it look real.
Back - back - back - back, whoa.
Thanks.
I'll go back into the baggage car.
Giddy-up!
Get those horses down!
Hurry!
Don't let them get away!
Hurry, get the horses down!
Hya!
All clear, Captain.
- Right!
# Tapioca, tapioca
# Tapioca, I ate
till I couldn't see straight
# Working on the railroad,
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way
# Tapioca, tapioca... #
- That's a code song all right.
Give them this.
If you please, Mr Thomson.
Thank you, Mr Farraday.
I'll tell you what to do.
There is no one in this crowd,
there is no one
in this sovereign stste,
there is no one in the universe
who can face himself
in the mirror and say,
"I'm as chock full of health as
the good Lord intended me to be."
There's no one for whom
that ain't necessary.
If I may continue
to have your attention.
I'd like to
introduce my colleague
from Boston, Massachusetts,
Mr Jim Farraday.
Thank you, Mr Thomson.
What is it we all crave? Not money,
not the luxuries money will buy.
It is our physical wellbeing.
# Tapioca, tapioca
# All she ever learned to cook
was tapioca
# For my dinner
# For my supper
# Tapioca I ate till
I couldn't see straight
# Working on the railroad,
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo
# Listen to wheels
go clacking on the way
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca
they seem to say. #
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up!
It's Dr Sunderland's
Magic Muscle Builder.
He's unarmed.
What is it?
It's female... and pretty!
Let me see. Come on, let me look!
Yeah... but it's Yankee.
So are we... for the time being.
May I offer my help?
Thank you.
Can you take us to Baxter Springs?
Us?
My patient and me.
What's he doing over there?
He's worried about his wife, Lukoa.
He worries from a distance.
The Confederates
can't do their own fighting,
so they get the Indians to rebel.
Our army hang
any Indian crossing the river.
Suppose we start moving your things?
Thank you.
It's not a real hospital.
It's one room.
I'll keep it going
till dad gets home.
When will that be?
When Johnny Rebel admits he's licked
Dad's in the army.
For a nurse you've
a solid hatred from Johnny Rebel.
We've been at war for four years.
Enough time to hate good and hard.
More than enough.
Wouldn't you like a blanket?
You're still damp.
No, thanks. The air will dry me.
You sure I'm not taking you
out of your way?
I wish you were.
Then this would be a real gesture.
It's nice of you anyway.
It's a day's ride to Baxter Springs.
- Good...
Staying long?
I hope so.
It's a pretty town. You'll like it.
I'm sure I will.
I was warned
about travelling salesman.
By whom?
Other travelling salesmen.
A man sees a pretty girl,
he ought to tell her so.
Do you see many in your travels?
Girls, I mean?
Most of the time Benjy. He's good
company but he's not very pretty.
Oh dear!
Sorry. Maybe you'd like
to rest in the back for a while?
We've got a long trip ahead.
No, I'm all right.
I'm fine.
We might hit another bump.
We might at that.
Tired?
- I'm used to it.
We'll get your things.
What about the hospital wagon?
I'll send for it.
I never thought I'd see it.
- What?
You and a Yankee girl.
A thing like that could start a war!
Over there, Lukoa.
Just put it anywhere.
Jim, if you get the other things
I can straighten this around.
Fine.
Where do you want them?
- Huh?
Where do you want them?
Oh! On the window seat please.
It was so nice of you to help us.
That's...
- Very kind. My father.
Oh.
It sure takes all kinds, don't it?
I beg your pardon?
It's a funny world.
Your father, proud of his uniform.
Other people like Jim Farraday
never even wore one.
He never was in the army?
But he's young
and he's certainly able-bodied.
He's a fine specimen.
It's for religious reasons.
No, ma'am. He's anti-war
on just straight physical grounds.
He just don't like the
idea of getting shot at.
Maybe even... killed.
Is that true?
It's the way I feel, Nora.
I can manage now, thank you.
A funny coincidence, our meeting.
You with your nursing home. Us
with Doc Sunderland's Muscle Builder.
Yes...
funny.
Benjy.
# Now gather round, folks,
and hear my song
# It'll make you happy,
it'll make you strong
# If pain and misery is your lot
# Doc Sunderland's remedies
hit the spot
# If what you've got is chronic
# There's nothing like his ton... ic
# Cos it builds you up
and it cures your ills
# One bottle's worth
a million pills. #
Come in closer, ladies and gentlemen!
As a favour to yourselves,
come in real close!
Before... and after.
If you please, Mr Thomson?
Yes sir, Mr Farraday.
# Tapioca, tapioca
# Tapioca I ate
till I couldn't see straight
# Working on the railroad
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca,
they seem to say. #
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you
what we're going to do.
There's no one in this crowd here,
there's no one in this great state,
there's no one in the universe,
who can face himself
in the mirror and say,
"I'm as chock full of health
as the good Lord intended me to be."
Everyone needs that.
William Shakespeare once wrote...
"Why let pain your pleasure spoil
for want of muscle-building oil?"
That's what Doc Sutherland
is offering you.
The only inside and outside
tonic beneficial to man.
Step right up.
It's 75 cents a bottle.
We won't be back until next year.
The lady wants two.
Surround the building!
Guard that door!
Don't shoot!
Trigger-happy fools!
We wanted him alive.
So what do we do?
- Obey orders.
And have you die and my men too?
Killing him could cost lives
and change the war.
Our wagon's outside if you'd like
to be taken to the hospital.
Thanks. In a minute.
I want this store
locked and guarded.
I'll search it later.
What are you looking for?
Help me up.
You didn't answer.
- No, I didn't.
I don't have to take your orders.
This isn't federal territory.
Let's go before the sheriff
takes over the federal government.
Hey, Doc,
this stuff as good as you claim?
Better.
Muscle Builder? When the
war's over, you should head south.
The Rebs will need it
when we get through with them.
The sheriff can stop us
searching the store.
Not us. I'll do the searching.
All right. He can stop you.
He can't stop a search warrant.
Why not tell him
what you're looking for?
Sure, tell him! Tell everybody!
Excuse me, lieutenant.
Six bits.
You can spare one bottle.
- Six bits.
Ain't you a patriot?
I've killed Rebs for people like you.
I said six bits!
All right! All right!
Jenkins, give Mr Kelso a hand!
Yes, sir.
Too bad. So expensive.
Look alive, Jenkins.
Yes, sir.
When I saw he was hurt
I suggested bringing him here.
Throw business your way.
I'm not looking for business,
Mr Farraday.
Bring in the other kettle.
Please, Miss Curtis.
Thank you very much.
This will burn just a bit.
Just hold this and press dwn.
I saw your father's picture.
Where's he stationed?
He's with General Sherman in Georgia
I want to be
with Sherman or Sheridan.
We hardly get news of the war.
Travellers have more news than...
Do you hear any war news?
I never listen.
He's a conscientious objector.
Not conscientious, just objecting.
Lucky you weren't in the draft.
I was, back in Boston.
Boston?
- Sure. Can't you tell?
Of course.
Then why aren't you in the army?
I am, in a way.
I hired a substitute for $300.
Brave fella, they tell me.
I may turn out to be a war hero.
By proxy, of course.
Whoa! I'd like to wipe them
off the face of the Earth.
Business before pleasure.
We can't afford trouble.
Let's see how tough fancy clothes is.
One knife, fancy clothes,
you and me to a finish.
About time for a drink.
That's why he ain't in uniform.
He's yeller.
Now he ain't so fancy!
I'll take him...
It's my invitation.
Get ready, stranger.
Jenkins, we're betting on you.
I'd better stop it.
- No! Let's see if he turns the other cheek.
Jenkins is the toughest
fighter I've got.
He'll cut that Boston lily to bits.
Don't bet on it.
Stick him, Jim, stick him!
No, don't!
You should have finished him.
Less to worry about when it's dark.
My men aren't sneaks.
There'll be no trouble.
Your men are a headache.
Leave town before they get hurt.
By you?
Don't play soldier boy with me.
I can get you a coat.
Thanks, I have one.
I'll buy the drinks later.
Some other time, maybe.
Miss Curtis?
Yes, Mr Kelso?
What do you know
about James Farraday?
Nothing. We met by accident
when my wagon broke down.
From which direction was he coming?
Well... it might have been
east or northeast.
Why?
Just curious.
For a man who spends $300
to keep from fighting, he...
"General Sheridan scores victory
in Northern Virginia."
The Rebs ain't running faster
than that soldier you worked over.
Mister.
Yes, sir.
James Farraday just sent a telegram.
Let's have it.
It's just a regular business message
Yeah, send it.
And... send this for me.
Yes, sir.
Is that you, Jim?
- It's Lieutenant Green.
We don't sell merchandise
after sundown.
We're not buying, we're looking.
A search warrant.
Don't get foolish, pop.
What is this?
We're a legitimate business...
Six bits for every bottle you bust.
And five cents for every empty.
I'm warning you to be careful.
Lieutenant, let's see what's in here
Sergeant.
- Don't touch...
The lieutenant came in like
he was Christopher Columbus
discovering America.
He called me pop.
Yankees never had no manners.
Easy.
# I had a brakeman for a husband
# He never made enough
to buy the meat
# Oh, don't have
a brakeman for a husband
# Or this is all
you'll ever get to eat
# Tapioca, tapioca
# All he ever could afford
was tapioca
# By the potful, by the carload
# But it came to an end,
I'm a widow again
# Take me on the railroad,
take me far away
# Johnny, pick a tune on your banjo
# Listen to the wheels
go clacking on their way
# Tapioca, tapioca, tapioca
they seem to say. #
Forgive this intrusion,
but being in the same business...
Run along, I'm spoken for.
I know an artist like you
would be surrounded by admirers.
No more. I got myself a steady.
I'm deeply envious of him.
It was the coincidence of
your song that brought me here.
What coincidence?
We have been using
that song for months.
Am I supposed to cut it out?
Not at all. The way you sing it,
you're entitled to it.
I thought you wanted trouble.
Quite the contrary.
I really put it over?
- Hmm, big.
Should I do it regular?
- Didn't you sing it before?
First time. It was a request.
- Do you recall who requested it?
My steady.
Sally, ask Mr Farraday to come in.
Won't you come in?
Here's that drink we didn't have.
Sally, find another home.
I won't be in the way.
I said find yourself another home.
Sure, sweetie, I don't mind.
I'll be with Laura.
If you want me, knock on the wall.
Sally?
- Yes?
Close the door.
I'm the man to take you
through the Union lines.
Here's to a no-trouble trip.
You're talking way over my head.
Farraday,
let's drop the games and save time.
I work for Anderson Smith
running horses for you Rebs.
You need any more proof?
I didn't say a word.
I like listening.
The longer you take to buy me the
easier it'll be to mess things up.
Kelso checked your telegram.
Now he's checking on you.
I'm still listening.
Listen quick.
Smith told me all about you.
Farraday's the name of someone
you went to college with.
You are Captain James Simmonds,
Georgia Volunteers.
Your brother was killed
at Bull Run.
Your pitchman's Benjamin Guterman.
More?
No.
You've got enough to hang
Benjy and me three times over.
Here's to that no-trouble trip
through the Union lines.
What part of home are you from?
The only thing we've got in common
is that we bleed if we're cut.
I'm in this for money.
How much?
- 2,000, gold.
That's what Smith promised,
cash on the line.
Benjy?
Give him 300 in gold.
we're inside the Confederate lines.
You can't get through
Indian territory without me.
Maybe not but we can try.
It's a deal.
Number 22, black.
Easy come, easy go, with our money.
He hasn't won a hand.
The faster he loses,
the quicker he'll go.
That won't be long.
Aces, a pair.
He's got the manners of a pig.
Here comes Christopher Columbus...
and the sheriff.
Gentlemen.
- What are you gonna sing?
Give us a song!
Gentlemen, please.
- Sing nice and loud, we'll chime in.
I have an announcement.
In cooperation with the army
from now on, any vehicle leaving
Baxter Springs will be searched.
What're you looking for?
When we find it, you'll know.
That fixes it.
- We must move fast.
Can you handle things
at the Curtis house?
Leave it to me.
I'll keep an eye on Manning.
Miss, would you... Do you have
anything for stomach poisoning?
It's very late.
- Anything! Please! Please!
Come in.
I didn't mean to turn you away.
You're very kind.
- I'm leaving early in the morning.
I understand. Never mind...
Nonsense. You come right in.
You sit down here.
That's it. I'll get something
from the hospital room.
We'll pump your stomach
and you'll feel better.
NO!
That never helps a case like mine!
Don't be alarmed.
It's practically painless.
I don't mind the pain.
Two doctors
tried the same thing.
They didn't get any place.
Exactly the same thing!
I have a special-type stomach.
Really?
- It's the way I'm formed.
Do you get these attacks often?
Four times a year. The only thing
that helps is kummel tea.
Kummel tea?
- It's a German special...
It's an old remedy for stomachache.
- Yeah.
You sit quietly
and I'll brew some right away.
Where's your partner?
In the saloon.
The water'll be boiled
in a moment. You look better.
Being in a warm house always helps.
Does Mr Farraday know you're sick?
When Jim gambles,
he doesn't like to be bothered.
Fine friend!
He's not so bad.
He gambles to forget his troubles.
What kind of troubles?
One thing and another.
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
That's it. Genuine kummel tea.
My grandmother said
good kummel tea will cure anything.
I'll show you
how she used to make it.
Was he in trouble
with police back East?
Except when it comes to gambling
and women, Jim's law-abiding.
Now,
if you'll bring some cups please.
Why can't you talk about it?
About what?
Mr Farraday's troubles.
I gave my sacred word
to him and his...
I gave my word.
One teaspoonful for flavouring.
My grandmother, may she
rest in peace, said one teaspoon.
No more, no less.
It must be shameful if you were
sworn to secrecy by him and his...
Who was it?
- I promised not to talk about that.
You understand my position?
Naturally.
I can feel that kummel taking hold.
Can I boil up another batch?
It can take a couple of pots
to come back to myself.
I could use another 300.
We have a contract, and that's that.
I'm ready when you are.
Pretty soon now. I'll let you know.
I know who that other person is.
A girl.
I... I promised.
Benjamin, who took care of you when
you were sick - Mr Farraday or me?
You did.
Either we are friends
or we are not friends.
We are friends.
Then tell me.
It won't go outside of this room.
You have my word.
Your sacred word?
My sacred word.
You were right.
A girl?
Two.
Was it... in Boston?
And New York.
Where else?
Chicago.
And?
Milwaukee.
That's why Jim wants to leave here.
Why?
He says there aren't enough girls here.
Hey, listen...! Don't...!
Give me the gun. No!
What's wrong?
It's all right.
Just target practice.
Oh, well...
Is she asleep?
Unconscious.
She's being put to bed.
When is she leaving town?
- Very early tomorrow.
What's this?
- Target practice.
She could outshoot the Union army
but she drinks like a Yankee.
Passes out
on one pot of Grandma's tea!
Nora's taking these boxes for us
but don't tell her.
The hospital wagon -
why didn't I think of that?
You were too busy.
She only got drunk because of you.
My being a conscientious objector?
Your reputation with women.
Thanks, friend!
I hope they don't search too hard.
They're used to this wagon.
They won't bother.
And if they do?
We shoot our way through.
You and Manning pick it up at the ford.
I'll meet you there at daybreak.
Where will I find Manning?
The livery stable.
I don't like dealing with him.
If he can run horses out,
he'll be able to get us through.
Here, you'd better hold on to
the bankroll. No sense trusting him.
Watch him. With Manning, you shoot
first and discuss the reasons later.
Yes... Yes...
Breakfast!
Well...
# Cos it builds you up
and it cures your ills
# One bottle's worth
a million pills #
How about a pick-you-up?
- Oh...
Oh...
Wh-Wh-When did you get here?
Last night. Ready for breakfast?
Coffee, bread and honey -
just what you ordered.
I... ordered?
Why, yes.
Is B-B-Benjy downstairs?
Why, no, he left last night
when you told him to go. Honey?
I told him to go?
There was no sense in us both
taking care of you.
But...!
- Cream?
Sugar?
One or two? Two.
Oh, don't you feel well?
I... I'll be all right.
Will you please go?
Isn't there something
I can do for you? A wet towel?
You'll call me
if you change your mind?
That was the nightgown you wanted
to wear, wasn't it?
All right, move on!
Have a good trip, Nora.
What do you want?
We're searching everything
going out of town.
You'd do better
stopping riffraff from coming in.
Don't mess up my things!
They'll be careful.
Now you woke the baby!
I'm sorry.
OK, boys. Miss Curtis can go on.
Thank you.
Giddy up! Get up!
What is this?
What are you doing...?
Get in the back and shut up!
Move!
- Keep your hands off her!
I'm afraid
I'm no Southern gentleman.
That's certain.
We'll pull up over there.
Come on!
Nobody's gonna hurt you, missy.
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this
but there was no option.
Jim'll join us, we'll take
these boxes and that's it.
What's in those boxes?
Well, it's a...
kind of a muscle-building.
You're the men Kelso was after.
You're thieving spies,
you and... Jim Farraday!
In the Confederate States of America,
they call us patriots.
Miss?
We'll need more cover.
There, down by the river.
Yes, sir, colonel, sir!
You sleep in the wagon. You'll be
more comfortable. I'll start supper.
Now, look, miss, please
stop worrying. There's no need.
You'll be safe here.
You've got my word.
Why not your sacred word?
Yes, ma'am.
Water those horses.
We're not stopping.
We're meeting
Farraday here tomorrow.
I got other plans.
If you want that thousand, you'll
have to wait. He's got the money.
Huh!
You wait for him, colonel, sir!
Hah! Hah!
Keep your eyes on the trail.
You're alive only because that squaw
comes from Yellow Hawk's village.
The squaw and the kid
are your life insurance.
I trade with Yellow Hawk.
She needn't worry.
The South must be proud of you!
The trail's that way.
Clean as a whistle.
You leave things how you found them.
They'll tend to it.
You coming back here, Mr Farraday?
Might. It's a good business town.
As good as they come, and growing.
Where are you heading?
I'm meeting my partner at Lawrence.
Huh! You'll see the difference!
Lawrence is dead compared to here.
All done.
- OK.
Thank you.
Get up!
We'll be with Kelso if you need us.
Is Mr Kelso there?
There's a message for him.
I'll give it to him.
Sorry, it's confidential.
Come in.
For you.
Some big news, too.
Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated.
General Lee's army is in retreat.
Say, that's great news. Do you...?
"Research show James Farraday was
a Union army major killed in action
two years ago."
"Suggest your man assumed
this identity for own purposes."
Let's pick up Jim Farraday.
Wait a minute. Farraday left town.
How was I to know you wanted him?
You never said anything.
When did he go?
Oh, four... no, five hours ago.
You searched his wagon?
- Yes.
He said he was off to Lawrence.
- We'll get him there.
He isn't going to Lawrence.
Can you track a wagon?
Yes, but not at night.
I want 12 men to go with us at dawn.
I'll have them.
Nothing much besides bottles.
Someone should take it
back to Baxter Springs.
Ross!
Next time it'll be your face.
The other wagon was here first.
A single horse, probably Farraday's,
took after the wagon.
How long ago? Can you tell?
No, but I can follow it.
It's called a Gatling gun.
Tell your men it fires 250 bullets
a minute, fast as rain from the sky.
I have told them. Now let the gun
say that you have earned the price.
Tell them to hang on
to their war bonnets.
Watch those!
Look.
One of your own rifle bullets.
It fits this gun.
This gun is worth ten tribes.
They'll all fear Yellow Hawk.
Unless they too get such guns.
They can't. Only four exist -
this is the only one in the West.
We march against Fort Smith.
Good hunting.
Six more bag of gold - 4,000
gold dollar - if you march with us.
It's not my war, not for just 4, 000.
Inside Fort Smith there is much more
It is yours if you shoot the gun.
How do you know what's inside?
My scouts have seen it.
With the fort's ammunition and
this gun, many tribes will join us.
Even with a gun, you need more men.
We have friends in other villages
- Yogalan, Taminiconju, Hiosake.
They will come when we call.
If I join you,
it's for one attack only.
I agree.
And an escort out the territory
when it's over.
I agree.
It's a deal. When do we march?
Sunrise.
Smoke signal over the ridge, sir.
Go to sleep now. No more crying.
We'll fight the war once we get out
of here. Where's Manning?
Gone. This morning, with the gun.
They're going to attack Fort Smith.
Come on, come on.
Just a minute.
That way to Fort Smith.
We're not going there. I'll drop you
off home, then I'm going home myself.
But we have to warn them.
I'm not concerned about Fort Smith.
But you're concerned about the gun,
and Brett Manning.
I'll catch up with him some time.
That's one thing I'm sure of.
You won't consider a truce-talk?
Not when you'd let the men
at the fort die.
Nothing I can do.
You can warn them.
Where I come from,
saving Yankees isn't very noble.
Can't you think of them
just as people?
I could, but it wouldn't be easy.
The same people burned my home
and killed my brother.
And, you know, if I made that noble
gesture you keep harping on...
...they'd shoot me for a spy.
I guess you're right.
In a war, you have to take sides.
And four years of war are more than
enough to learn how to hate good
and hard. You said that, remember?
There aren't really many differences
between us. Some day
when we know each other better...
Some day... maybe.
Time to turn in.
Just like you Yankees - you want
all the territory for yourselves.
Mason-Dixon Line -
and see that you don't cross it.
Get up! Slowly!
Go on, pick it up. The best kind
of rebels are dead ones.
Mr Kelso and I have the same
philosophy but different viewpoints.
Where's that gun?
He just searched me, didn't he?
Manning sold it to Yellow Hawk.
They're advancing on Fort Smith.
If we hurry, we may make it.
Thomas, alert the Lawrence garrison.
The fort'll need help.
You should send Miss Curtis back with
them so she won't see the bloodshed.
It'll be like Atlanta when you brave
Yankee soldiers burnt us out!
The fort isn't all Yankee soldiers.
Their families are with them.
They've got some kind
of rapid-fire gun.
I've heard about such a gun.
It will wipe us out.
We can't locate it.
We need to send out a patrol.
Send out 12 men.
- Yes, sir.
Go up the tower.
Report all activity to me.
Yes, sir.
The fort is just over that rise.
That's the Gatling gun.
Mr Kelso, give me Mr Farraday's gun.
Keep your men out of sight.
Fort can't last much longer.
I need one man with me.
We have to knock out that gun.
I'm ready when you are.
We'll use knives if we reach Manning.
If we stop him, we stop the gun.
He's probably the only one
who can operate it.
He may not be the only one.
What about your leg? Any of the men
will take your place...
I'll be OK. We'll go up on opposite
flanks. The rocks protect the gun.
Deploy the men behind that ridge.
No noise - we only have one chance.
Yes, sir.
Take cover.
More of them.
Colonel, more smoke signals!
Two new tribes have joined Yellow Hawk.
Maybe 1,000, maybe more.
Colonel Stagg!
Signals from Major Dawson.
He's on Ridge Hill.
- Signal him to await orders.
Yes, sir.
No, you can't shoot.
No noise, those were the orders.
Signal Major Dawson to attack!
I guess I can deliver it
to the arsenal in Indianapolis now.
Where are you from, Mr...?
James Simmons, Georgia Volunteers.
That train robbery was a nice job -
good timing.
Sergeant, let's move this gun
inside the fort.
Mr Kelso, I hope you'll take
into consideration what Jim did...
I... never liked being judge
orjury, Miss Curtis.
Richmond and Petersburg have fallen.
Lee's army is in full retreat.
It's a matter of days now.
What happens to you will be
up to the military court...
...if you're around when they meet.
Jim...
Do you have any plans?
I'll go home, fix up the old place.
Travel maybe - west, I guess.
Anywhere near Baxter Springs?
My first stop.
That different point of view again.
I plan to make it your last stop.
Next to last. You'll like Atlanta.
