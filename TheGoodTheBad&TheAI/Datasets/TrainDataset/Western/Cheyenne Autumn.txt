- Good morning, Wichowsky.
- Troops all present or accounted for, sir.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Can I steal some of your coffee?
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
Any news?
Here comes another name now.
- Senator.
- Great.
Looks like we're gonna be up
to our ears in congressmen.
Well, the more the better.
I wish every bigwig in Washington
could see this place.
Deborah, they're here already.
Lord knows when
the Congressional Committee will arrive.
I don't blame them for being early.
You and I know what this means
to them, uncle.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J...
...K., L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Wonderful.
Come help me set the table.
Attention!
- Scott.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.
- Archer.
- Good morning, sir.
- Indians, huh?
- Yep.
Any word
from the Congressional Party?
They haven't left Fort Scott yet.
Well, let me know. Keep me advised.
Yes, sir.
Wichowsky, put the men at ease.
Let them smoke...
...if they've got anything to smoke,
which I doubt.
At ease!
You're ready to smoke!
- Good morning, friend Thomas.
- Good morning, friend Deborah.
Well, now, where have you been
hiding that dress?
That's pretty stylish for a Quaker.
I made it just for this great day.
It's mighty pretty.
Do you know when they'll arrive?
Well, you can't expect speed
from congressmen...
...but they ought to be here
any minute now.
Well, I'd offer to help you,
but I can see you don't need it.
Oh, don't I, now?
Well, the leg on the senator's chair
seems to be stuck.
Senator, huh?
Well, let's see what's wrong.
There we are.
All neat and tidy for the senator.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Anytime.
Friend Deborah,
where do you want the senator's chair?
I think I'll put him
at the head of the table.
He'd like that.
Plumtree, go down the road.
Let us know when those gentlemen
from the East arrive.
- Archer!
- Yes, sir.
When is that blasted party
coming anyway?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know, sir.
- Hey, you.
- Sir.
Any news on that party
from the East yet?
No. No, sir. Nothing since 11:30.
Eleven-thirty?
- Do you realize it's 5:30 now?
- Yes, sir.
Archer, see what he wants.
Plumtree.
I ain't a-getting paid for thinking, sir
but I don't think them folks is a-coming.
Just came in from Fort Reno, sir.
I'll be damned!
"Congressional Committee delayed
by bumpy roads and dust storms.
Decided to return to Reno in order
to rest up for the Officers' Ball tonight."
You mean
they're not coming here at all?
How long do they expect me to wait
to build some barracks out here?
Archer, I'm going to Fort Reno,
see to it.
Friend major, please...
...will you tell them about the medicine
and the food the Indians need?
And all the things
that were promised?
Uncle, you must make him listen.
How can I?
You know what he thinks of Quakers.
You've been here from the beginning.
You've watched them die of smallpox
and measles and malaria.
You've watched them starve.
Haven't you anything to say?
Nothing that you can't say better.
Major Braden!
I'm asking you to plead for justice.
I'm asking you to make them realize...
...that over a thousand Cheyenne
were brought here...
...and only 286 are left alive.
Miss Wright, my responsibility to the Indians
is only to guard them.
When you have reached my age,
you will have realized...
...that it pays to stick
to your own knitting.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Dull Knife! Little Wolf!
What happened today
changes nothing.
The Indian Bureau
is still pledged to provide you...
...with adequate clothing and rations.
You are still pledged
to abide by the law.
Remember that.
We are asked to remember much.
The white man remembers nothing.
You spoke the truth for us.
This we will not forget.
But there will be no more school.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, please don't do that
to the children.
The white man's words are lies!
It is better that our children
not learn them.
It is not the words,
but who speaks them.
Has speaking white men's words
made you a liar?
Our words were learned long ago.
When some white men
still spoke truth.
It ain't in my department, sir...
...but looks to me
like them kids is a-playing hooky.
You're gonna be pretty lonesome,
friend School Teacher.
No scholars.
They'll come.
When?
Spanish Woman!
Friend Deborah, leave this place.
Friend Thomas, you know
I came here to carry out a task.
I can't leave now.
Bunking in this schoolhouse
won't help.
It will show them
that I'm on their side.
Not unless you can change color.
You know what they call whites?
- And  means "spider"!
- Means "spider"!
That's right.
- That's what they think of all of us.
- And why shouldn't they?
How many Cheyennes have you fought?
How many have you killed?
Deborah, look, will you take
the blinders off just for once?
You claim no self-respecting Quaker
could fall in love with a soldier...
...but you've fallen in love
with a whole tribe of them.
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?
- Of course, I have.
- No, you haven't!
All you've seen is reservation Indians,
looking pitiful as fish out of water.
But give them a chance, they're
the greatest fighters in the world.
Will you listen to me?
It takes a blue coat to make
a white man a soldier.
But a Cheyenne is a soldier
from the first slap on his bottom.
War is his life.
He's fierce, he's smart.
And he's meaner than sin.
Possibly you can only think of the past,
but I'm here to think about the future.
All right.
You think of the future.
Want some help?
I'll manage.
Better keep that lamp lit tonight.
And if anything happens,
ring the bell.
- Little Wolf.
- Yes?
- What's happened?
- This is not the place for you.
Spanish Woman...
...where are they going?
- Home.
- Home?
What you call Yellowstone country.
What about the children?
They are Cheyenne.
But who will care for them?
We will do what we can.
They are Cheyenne.
Dull Knife, the old chief
is much too sick.
He'll never make such a trip.
Let...
If he lives to ride
even a mile closer to home...
...he will die as a man should.
There will be no more dying
in this place.
They've skipped.
Thank God.
What the hell do you mean by that?
I've waited since I was 10 years old
for this chance.
Then you're a damned idiot.
I want D Troop ready
and mounted in 10 minutes.
E Troop and wagons to follow
under your command.
No artillery. Plumtree!
- Come here!
- Yes, sir!
E Troop and train reporting, sir.
You brought the wagons
along too fast, Mr. Scott.
Draft animals can't stand it.
They can rest up tonight.
They can?
Well, that's an assumption
you had no right to make.
We're gonna keep moving.
That's fine with me, sir.
- Scott, tell me something.
- Sir?
What put the blood in your eye?
It's just a private matter, sir.
Nothing that affects
an officer's conduct is private.
My father died
in the Fetterman Massacre back in '66.
Mother and I were at the fort
when they brought his body in.
I was only 10 years old.
Until that time,
I never wanted to be a soldier.
Well, that doesn't give you
a personal license to kill Indians.
The job of this Army
is to keep the peace.
I understand, sir.
You do, huh?
Well, just make sure you understand...
...these Cheyenne broke no law
when they left the Agency.
And they won't
unless they cross the river.
So if you provoke trouble...
...I’ll see that you lose
those shoulder straps...
...if I have to tear them off myself.
Understood?
Understood, sir.
Mr. Scott!
Sir?
I knew your father.
- Guide on!
- Sir.
Troop, halt!
Prepare to dismount!
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
- Sir!
- Yes.
Are you going to let them jump
the reservation right bef?
They haven't jumped the reservation.
They haven't crossed the river yet.
- Sir, I most respectfully object to...
- Put it in writing.
Join your troop, mister.
Sir.
No. No, thanks.
Spanish Woman, what's happening?
I think war.
Spanish Woman, speak to Dull Knife.
He'll listen to you.
I can do nothing.
Nothing.
- School teacher.
- Little Wolf, you promised...
Take the children, join the others.
Troop, halt!
Troop, halt!
- Plumtree.
- Sir?
I don't like the look of it.
Take a look up that canyon.
- Yes, sir.
- Jones, you cover him.
Jones!
Name's Smith, sir.
Oh, well, go on up with him. Go on!
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
But that canyon there
is plumb full of Indians.
- On ride into line! Yo!
- Hey, Smitty, wait a minute.
On ride into line! Yo!
You've got a lot to explain
to a court martial, Archer.
Sergeant...
Cannon's ready?
Forward on the double!
Cannon forward on the double!
Prepare to dismount!
- Prepare to dismount!
- Dismount!
Now!
Motion!
All soldiers to the rear!
All soldiers to the rear!
Stop!
- Major, I've got to tell you...
- Go back to your troop.
...the majority of those people
are women and children!
- Maybe 50 or 60 warriors.
- Archer, you're under arrest.
Number one gun, fire!
Number two gun, fire!
Fire number one.
Fire.
Cease firing!
Where's the major?
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.
They're angry because my son fired
the first shot.
Does it ever matter
who fires the first shot?
Those dirty, murdering...
- The major's dead, sir.
- Pick up the horses.
- I said, the major's dead, sir!
- Shut up!
Aren't you gonna give them a?
Plumtree, Brown,
get the horses off the wagons.
- Yes, sir.
- Yo.
- Name's Smith, sir.
- All right, get to work!
My son says,
"The soldiers do not follow."
Dull Knife, you know the soldiers
will have to follow us.
Have you thought what will happen
to your wife and son?
There will be war.
- Little Wolf.
- These are my wives.
I pray the young one
will give me sons.
But I want them to be born where I
and all my people before me were born.
Even a dog can go where he likes...
...but not a Cheyenne.
You may go where you like.
No.
No.
No.
But...
In
Take your pick. They're all saying
the same things we're saying:
"Bloodthirsty savages on the loose.
Burning, killing,
violating beautiful white women!"
It's not news anymore.
We're gonna take a different tack.
From now on, we're going to grieve
for the noble red man.
We'll sell more paper that way.
Now, see to it!
- Mr. Secretary.
- Come in. Come in.
Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.
Now, no matter
what you may have heard...
We assure you there's nothing personal
about our proposed legislation.
The entire Senate
has the greatest respect for you...
...you know that.
But all I know is that you're trying
to snatch the Indian Bureau away...
...from my department
and hand it over to the Army.
Mr. Senator?
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?
An Arapaho? Any Indian?
Have you ever been west
of the Mississippi River?
- What are driving at, sir?
- Well, just this.
Why are three eastern senators
suddenly so concerned about Indians?
Well, it's strictly
a matter of economy.
The Army has to be out there anyway.
Oh, so that's all it is.
I was afraid perhaps that some
of the dollar patriots...
...who are sleeping on my doorstep
might have been sleeping on yours.
Sir, are you questioning
our honesty of purpose?
No more than I question theirs.
Their honest purpose
is to grab every acre of land...
...the Indians once thought
they owned.
You can't say that's Army policy.
Well, I can say it amounts
to the same thing.
The smaller the reservations,
the easier they are to guard.
You let the Army have its way...
...and they'll end up the size
of postage stamps.
Exactly what the land-grabbers want.
We'll be late
for that committee meeting.
- Excuse us, Mr. Secretary.
- Oh, Henry.
You and I fought together
at Gettysburg...
...yet you'd never even seen
a Negro slave.
All you ever knew...
...is that they were human beings
with the rights of human beings.
And it was worth an arm to you.
Carl, I'll stall this legislation, but unless
those Cheyenne are found soon...
...or if you make one false move,
God help you.
God help me.
Leave us.
When Little Wolf speaks  words
they are for my ears alone.
This I say:
We have always thought as one.
Never has the thickness
of a straw come between us.
We still think as one.
As war chief...
...I may raise my hand only
against the enemy.
We still think as one.
That is why
I must sleep with no wife...
...saving all my strength for a fight
against the soldiers.
But your son...
...tries to steal my youngest wife.
This cannot be.
He is of my blood.
And my blood has never been bad.
He is of your blood...
...but he is not you.
Troop, halt!
Troop, halt!
Sergeant.
Mr. Scott.
Unlimber the guns!
If we attack,
I think we're in for a beating.
- Here's what I want...
- Their backs are to the wall!
And a lot of flat land to cross
before we get there.
I'd rather force them to attack us.
- Well, they ain't done nothing foolish yet.
- I know.
- Take D Troop, get on their flanks.
- Sir.
Mr. Scott, dismount half of E Troop
to protect the guns and wagons.
Then you move out with the rest
to cover the right flank.
Yes, sir.
And remember, Mr. Scott...
...the trick to being brave
is not to be too brave.
- Any questions?
- No questions, sir.
Right.
Plumtree, Murphy, take the point!
Take the point. Yo!
A little faster on there, come on.
Hurry up there.
You all right?
Well, yes, sir.
On left, to the line.
Forward at the walk. Yo!
Walk trot!
- What in the hell is that kid doing?
- As you were.
What the hell is he doing?
Canter!
Company, charge!
Mr. Scott!
Scott!
Damn you!
Front left, into line!
Yo!
Prepare to dismount.
- Get the guns out!
- They're at the wagons.
- Get the guns. Move!
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, move it.
- Come on.
- Get them out of there.
- Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
Get out of there.
Mr. Scott!
- I told you to cover that flank.
- I'm sorry, sir.
From now on, you don't scratch
till I itch, is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Plumtree, Thompson.
Here, let me help.
Sir...
Yo, there.
Jessie, Homer, Shug.
Come here. Come here.
Hey, come on. Come here.
Slow down.
Lookit there.
Real blanket-head Injuns.
I sure would like to have me
that little paint.
And I sure would like
to kill me an Injun.
Can't you gut-eaters
talk any Texican?
Yes, sir. I'd sure love
to kill me an Injun.
I dare you, Homer.
- You dare me?
- I dare you.
I always wanted
to kill me an Injun.
All them old-timers back home...
...a- hoorahing about
how many scalps they've took.
Jessie, that's one of them there,
one of them there Cheyenne.
We better skedaddle
and get that herd out of here.
- Let's go.
- Not till I get my scalp, we won't.
G-O-O-D. Good.
G-O-O. Good.
