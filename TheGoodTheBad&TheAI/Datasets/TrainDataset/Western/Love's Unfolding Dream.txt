Here we go.
- Could you take this for me? Thanks a lot.
-
Appreciate it.
Giddap! Let's go!
Cracker, come on!
Hyah!
- Come on, children. Recess is over.
- Here we go.
Maddie, Jacob, inside.
Emily, what happened?
I fell off the swing
and broke my arm.
- I fell off swings a lot when I was little.
- Did you hurt your arm?
- My arm, my leg, my fingers.
- Twice.
- My nose.
-
- You fell a lot.
- She sure did.
Can you wiggle your fingers?
- Can I go back to school?
- Sure can.
Just wash that up.
Okay?
You are a natural born caretaker, Lindy.
'Cause I can tell a bruise
from a broken bone?
Because you can make people feel better
when they're hurt and scared.
Just like you, Mama.
- Lindy, what brings you into town?
- Came to get my newspapers.
And I thought I'd ask my best fella
to take me to lunch at the hotel.
One of these days somebody else is gonna be
your best fella and I'm gonna get jealous.
There may be another fella in my life someday,
but you'll always be the best papa.
That's worth the best meal
the hotel has to offer.
How'd you get to be so clever
to wrap me around your little finger?
- I hear Dr. Jackson is looking for a new assistant.
- You mean it?
- Absolutely.
- I'd better get there before
somebody else gets the job!
- What about lunch?
- Another time, Papa.
So much for bein' her best fella.
- Hey.
-  Clark!
You startled me.
- What are these for?
- Nothing in particular.
Maybe I just wanted to give
my beautiful wife some flowers.
Mr. Davis, you do turn my head.
Enough to steal a kiss?
You don't have to steal it.
- Grandma?
- Grandpa!
Did you get all the eggs?
-
- No.
Stop lollygagging around.
Come on. Get to it.
Yes, sir.
Clark.
Morning.
Doc Jackson, I'm here
for the assistant position.
Oh, you just hold on there, Belinda.
I can't hire you.
But I know sutures
and basic first aid.
I even learned a new wrapping technique
for sprains that Dr. Usla recommends.
Where'd you learn that?
I read his book. I've read a lot of
medical books and newspaper articles.
- Everything I get my hands on.
- Reading a few books doesn't make you qualified.
all that book knowledge is useless.
But I can learn. I know more
than anyone in Anderson Corner.
Well, I don't doubt it.
This is all I've ever wanted to do with my life.
I could learn so much from you, Doc.
Women aren't supposed to be doctors.
What about marriage?
- I'm not gettin' married.
- Ever?
- Well, Doc, I mean-
- Women are meant to marry and have children.
Which is exactly what you'll do
when the right man comes along.
Trust me, marriage and
a career in medicine will never work.
I'm not giving up.
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell applied to 29 schools
before she got accepted into Geneva College.
Elizabeth Blackwell
is the exception, not the rule.
Now, Geneva College may accept
your application, but I won't. Good day.
Come on.
Whoa.
- Hey.
- Hey, Clark, what can I do for ya?
I just came into town to pick up
some supplies from the general store.
Thought I would stop by to see if the five of you
would like to come out to dinner tonight.
Sounds good. I'm always happy
to eat at your house instead of mine.
- Oh, really?
- Not that Missie's cooking isn't good.
- It's interesting.
- It's all right, Zach.
I love my daughter dearly, but I have to admit
she does not take after her mama...
Excuse me, Sheriff.
- What can I do for you?
- I'm Drew Simpson.
- My uncle was Hank Simpson.
- Hank was a fine man. My condolences.
- Well, thank you, Mr. -
- Davis. Clark Davis.
Our place is next to Hank's.
He was a good neighbor.
Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity
to meet Uncle Hank, living so far away and all.
- Where you from?
- New York City.
New York City. I'll bet that's
a sight different than our little town.
Oh, yes.
Well, I mean, it's much bigger.
A little bit more cultured
and sophisticated.
- Rustic.
-
Anyway,
the stage driver suggested...
I ask you for directions to my uncle's place.
I can do better than that. Got my buckboard
outside. I'll take you out there myself.
That's awful kind of you, Mr. Davis.
- Sheriff.
- Good day.
- Get up, boys.
-
Whoa.
Hold these.
Squatters settled in
after your uncle passed.
I'm afraid they didn't
take care of your place properly.
I'd hoped it would be
in good enough shape to sell right away.
- You're not staying.
- Certainly not.
Gonna take a sight of work
to make it presentable.
Pack rats gonna settle into those walls
if you don't get those holes patched up.
- Do you know anyone I could hire to do that?
- You don't want to yourself?
I just graduated from law school.
I know all about writs and torts
and the right of habeas corpus...
but nothing about working on a farm.
- I'd be happy to help you.
- Would you? Thank you.
- I'll pay you, of course.
- That's mighty generous, but no thanks.
I can't let you work for nothing.
You'd be allowing me to
repay a debt to a good friend.
- Then I accept.
- Good.
-
-
-
-
Please call me Sadie.
Caleb is a bright boy.
But he's very behind for his age,
especially in reading and writing.
He isn't doing his homework, and he said
that you and his father won't help him with it.
I'm afraid my husband Charles
don't hold much with schoolwork.
I'm sure you understand
the importance of a good education.
I know how bad it feels
when you don't have one.
I only got through
the second grade...
before I had to take care
of the younger kids.
The fact is, I can only read
a few words in this paper.
So it's not that you won't help him,
it's just that you can't.
- What about your husband?
- He can't read at all.
I will spend some
extra time with Caleb.
But with 14 students of different ages
and grades, it's going to be difficult.
Thank you, Mrs. Tyler.
I appreciate anything you can do for him.
l-
You know, Sadie, I could teach you how to read,
and then you could help Caleb to learn.
I-I have to go, Mrs. Tyler.
The Kents have kept to themselves
since they moved into town.
You couldn't have known, Mama.
The signs were all there.
I just missed them.
Hey, Mom. Hey, Sis.
What's for dinner?
Brunswick stew. And it's almost ready,
so you boys go and wash up for supper.
Can we go to Grandma
and Grandpa's for dinner?
What does Charles Kent do?
George has hired him part-time at
the general store. He does other odd jobs.
Mostly he wants to
get a farm for himself.
- How did you get all that out of him?
- I asked him.
He doesn't seem very talkative to me.
Well, generally, when the sheriff
asks questions people give answers.
If Mrs. Kent would learn to read...
a whole new world would open up for her,
just like it did for me, Mama.
She'd become a different person.
Maybe that's what
her husband is afraid of.
What kind of woman allows her husband
to dictate to her that way?
I wouldn't know, Lindy.
I haven't had any experience with that kind.
And you never will, Zachary Tyler.
- Oh.
-
- Is there a doctor in town?
- Yes. Are you hurt?
No, not me. My employer, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
has grown gravely ill.
-
-
- How long has she been like this?
- An hour or so, Miss.
Whoa. Whoa.
Doc, I got a patient for you.
All right, bring her
over here on the table.
Put her right-That's it.
All right. All right.
Watch her head.
Watch her head.
All right.
Okay.
Her breathing is fine. Pulse is steady.
Her skin's clammy to the touch, Doc.
Her sentences didn't make sense.
Then she collapsed.
- She been drinking?
- Of course not!
- How long y'all been traveling?
- We left Beacon Hill nearly two weeks ago.
- What's she doing out here?
- Visiting friends in Denver.
- The Montgomerys. A very prominent family.
- Do you think she had a stroke?
- Why would you say that?
- I read about the symptoms in
- Can you help her, Doctor?
- Unfortunately, I have another patient.
Possibly a breach birth.
But you can't leave
Mrs. Stafford-Smith!
And she seems fairly stable.
There's only one of me.
- I'll stay, Doc.
- Well, I don't have much choice, do I?
All right, just make sure
she's comfortable...
and keep a close eye on her.
I'll get back as soon as I can.
Mrs. Tyler?
Hi, Sadie.
I just wanted to talk to you about-
- My boy in trouble at school?
- Oh, no.
Nothing like that.
I stopped to bring some books for Mrs. Kent
I thought she might be interested in.
- You ask her for books?
- No.
No, she didn't.
I-I thought that-
Well, you thought wrong.
She got no use for books here.
No, I'm afraid not.
Dr. Jackson, she's awake!
H-Heaven's day-
- Get up. Get up.
-
and I believe you've had a stroke.
My photos- coach- bags-
Calm down. Calm down.
This is not good for you, ma'am.
Have-All that's left-
I have your bag right here.
All your things are inside.
Her speech
has obviously been impaired.
Well, I don't think it's as bad
as it could have been.
There's some paralysis
on her right side...
but her left side seems unaffected.
As soon as she's well enough,
I could help her do some movement therapy.
I read they're having
good results with that.
Well, she will need
someone with her constantly...
till we get a better grasp
of her physical limitations.
I won't leave her side, Doctor.
It should be someone with at least
rudimentary medical knowledge.
Belinda-
I can do it!
I don't want you to misinterpret this
as a permanent job offer, young lady.
- I haven't changed my mind
about women in medicine.
- So I'd be like your assistant?
Not exactly.
You will help Mrs. Stafford-Smith...
with her movement therapy.
- That is all.
- I accept.
Something I can do for you, son?
Uh, well, yes, I've got this problem.
- Mm-hmm.
- A carbuncle that is driving me crazy.
And you see,
the area that's affected...
has been getting a good deal of sitting time,
if you know what I mean.
Oh. You're trying to tell me
you've got a boil on your backside.
Oh! That is a mean-looking carbuncle
you got there, all right.
Uh, would you bring me
some of that rider's liniment.
It's on the top shelf in there.
Would you stop rubbing!
- I can't help it.
- Well, the more you scratch it, the itchier it gets.
Here you go, Doc.
Oh! Hey, now. Whoa!
- Wait. Never mind.
- Well-
- W-What about your carbuncle?
- What carbuncle?
Doctor.
You see, that's another reason
I can't hire a woman.
How am I going to make my money
with you scaring away my patients?
Well, what do you think?
Let me get this straight.
You want to hire Sadie
to help you at school...
so you can teach her to read
without her husband knowing?
- It's an ingenious plan, if you ask me.
- What will you have her do?
Whatever needs to be done. Sweep the floors,
clean blackboards, keep the wood stove burning.
Simple things that allow her to
learn along with the children.
Don't you think the way you're
going about this is just a little sneaky?
I think the Lord
will forgive my methods...
if I can offer this poor woman
a path out of the darkness of ignorance.
As long as Mrs. Stafford-Smith
needs me.
After that Doc says I get the boot.
You will prove yourself so indispensable
that he will never want to let you go.
That's the idea.
Grandma, there's one too many
plates for the table.
We have a guest
joining us for supper.
Come on in, young man.
Let me introduce you.
This is my wife Marty.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- My daughter Missie.
- How do you do?
And this is my granddaughter Belinda.
Lindy, this is Mr. Drew Simpson.
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Simpson.
I trust your journey here hasn't left you
suffering any adverse affects.
Nothing worth speaking of.
- We're all very interested
in hearing about your journey.
- I know I am.
- Yeah.
- We're having a simple dinner.
Fried chicken.
I hope you like it.
Lord, we thank you for the food
that's in front of us...
the family that surrounds us...
and the new friend
that's joined us at our table.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Ah-ah-ah!
Jacob, honey. Guests first.
Would you like a biscuit,
Mr. Simpson?
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry about your uncle.
He was a wonderful man.
Belinda spent quite a bit of time with him
in his last few weeks.
- She nursed him right to the very end.
- That was very kind of you.
Well, Lindy's a natural caretaker.
In fact, she's working
in town with Doc Jackson.
- I hope to be a doctor someday.
- Oh.
That's rather unusual, isn't it?
- Pardon me?
- A woman doctor.
- It doesn't seem quite appropriate.
- Appropriate?
Why would a lady want to subject herself to such
a mentally and physically taxing line of work?
Oh, boy.
I would think being from New York City you
would have a more enlightened view of women.
And by enlightened I assume you mean
a view that agrees with yours.
That is, if you're open
to being educated.
I think you'll find the majority of men
uncomfortable...
being tended to
by someone of the weaker sex.
I'm just saying that,
like most men...
when I marry
I'll need my wife at home.
She'll have enough to do
just taking care of me and our children.
- I'm sure she will.
- More potatoes, anyone?
- Yes.
-
You're awake. Good.
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith?
Tired.
Here.
No!
Don't need help.
- Your speech is better today.
- But not my arm.
With movement therapy it's possible
to regain the use of your arm. Like this.
Don't touch me.
You're awake, madam.
This is wonderful!
- Don't fuss over me, Windsor.
- Sorry, madam.
- We should let her get some rest.
- Of course, Miss.
I'll be in the next room, Madam.
I won't leave you.
I know you won't, Windsor.
if you hadn't been available
to help me fix up the place, Mr. Davis.
I'd never have got it
good enough to sell.
Glad to do it.
-
- Ow!
Wire. Hold on.
- Let me take a look at it. Let me see it.
- Naw, it's nothing.
Yeah, that puncture wound is deep.
I'll tell you, one thing you don't
mess around with is rusty wire.
You'll get a nasty infection.
I want you to go into town,
see the doc.
- I'm fine, really.
- Go on now. You don't mess with rust in a cut.
- I'll finish up here.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Whoa.
Afternoon, Mr. Simpson.
Good afternoon, Miss Tyler.
I came to see Doctor Jackson about my hand.
He's out checking on patients.
Why? What's wrong?
A little run-in with a rusty wire.
- When do you expect the doc to return?
- Not for hours.
Rusty wire?
Tetanus can take hold pretty quick.
- Might end up losing the hand.
- I think you're exaggerating.
I understand that you're uncomfortable
being tended to by the weaker sex...
but unless we clean that wound immediately
it might be too late.
Lockjaw could set in by tonight.
Although that may
not be the worst thing.
All right.
How much humble pie do I have to eat
to persuade you to help me?
Enough to make me believe you sincerely regret
saying I have no business becoming a doctor.
I most sincerely regret it.
Come inside.
My grandpa tells me
you went to Columbia University.
You didn't mention that
the other day at dinner.
I guess I could have worked that in...
when you offered to recommend articles
to help enlighten me.
That would have been a good time.
You're so fortunate to have
the opportunity to study at Columbia.
- I suppose that's true.
- I can't be a doctor without the proper education.
Most hospitals won't even consider me
for a nursing position.
The proper education requires
a great deal of money.
I've been saving for a long time.
-
- I'm sorry if it stings.
No, no, it's all right.
Actually, you've been very gentle.
There.
You're all set.
Remember to keep the wound cleaned.
At the risk of bringing up an old argument,
you're a bright and beautiful young woman-
- Beautiful?
- Yes.
Anyway, you'll surely
be married before long.
Why would you want to waste your time
preparing for a career that you'll have to leave?
Why does every man assume
that I'm on a hunt for a husband?
Isn't that the goal?
Find a mate, settle down, have children?
As a lawyer, everything
is black or white to you, isn't it?
Well, that's-
that's rather simplistic.
That's why we're different.
I see all of God's colors.
And somewhere between black and white
is my dream to be a doctor.
- I should get back to the ranch.
- Of course.
Please tell my grandpa I said hello.
Those sheets are rough.
They're all I've got.
How long until I can leave?
You can move to the hotel today,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith, if Belinda will stay with you.
- Can you do that?
- But I thought I'd continue to work here with you.
Mrs. Stafford-Smith needs a nurse.
- I thought that's what you wanted to be.
- Actually I want to be a doctor.
It's all settled then.
I think that's recess.
You're dismissed.
- You want me to keep an eye on them, Mrs. Tyler?
- Yes. Thank you, Sadie.
- Is everything all right?
- You forgot your lunch today.
Oh, you are so sweet to bring it.
I am starving. Thank you.
Saw Charles Kent this morning.
He told me Sadie really enjoys working here.
She is learning
more and more every day.
She's already ahead of Caleb.
Now she can help him with his work.
I know how much you want to help Sadie,
but Charles is a proud man.
Pride is a man's downfall, Zach.
He won't take it too well if he finds out
she's doing something behind his back.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.
I'm afraid so, Madam.
I suppose it's a step up
from the clinic.
Still, these pillows are much too flat.
They'll never do.
And surely they've got better linen.
Oh!
I'm mortified by these
inferior accommodations.
But I'm afraid it's not possible to get
anything better in this uncivilized outpost.
Oh, Miss Tyler, please come in.
Madam, I'll just be down in the restaurant
to check on your tea.
Wash the china yourself, Windsor.
I don't trust these people
to have high standards of cleanliness.
Yes, Madam.
How are you feeling today,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith?
How do you think I'm feeling...
being forced to endure
these primitive conditions?
You know,
we're not all uncivilized here.
Really? Did I somehow miss
seeing the opera house?
Or a good library?
Or even a hat shop with
the latest fashions from Europe?
No? I thought not.
- Anderson Corner has other things to offer.
- Such as?
Good people. And a church that
welcomes everybody, including strangers.
And we take care of each other
in difficult times.
You've never even been
outside this small town, have you?
Actually I was born in New York.
I didn't come here until I was 14.
So I do know a few things
about the world outside.
But I much prefer Anderson Corner.
You actually like it here.
Compared to New York
it's heaven on earth.
I'm going to miss it terribly
when I leave to study to be a doctor.
Well, there's a surprising ambition
for a farm girl.
- I believe it's what God called me to do.
- God? Ha!
He is unconcerned
with your ambitions.
You don't mean that.
The only thing you have
to rely on in this world is yourself.
It must be awful lonely
believing in nothing but myself.
When you've had a little experience
with the harsh realities of life...
you'll abandon that naive faith.
I've had a great deal
of experience of harsh reality.
- Without my faith I expect I'd be much like you.
- How's that?
Very unhappy.
Wha-
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Drew. I'm so glad
you could join us for supper.
Belinda, I need some eggs, please.
All right, Grandma.
Everyone here works for their supper.
- Might as well spit it out.
- What?
Whatever it is you're stewing over.
I apologize for being
so opinionated and outspoken.
- You probably can't help it.
- Can you?
Not to save my life.
Truce?
Truce.
Truce.
Remember, as I'm moving your arm you've got
to imagine you're doing it on your own. Okay?
I saw you reading late
into the night last night.
I'm so sorry.
Did the light keep you awake?
My age keeps me awake.
I'll turn out the light
earlier tonight.
It must have been a very interesting book
to keep you awake at that hour.
Oh, it is. It's called
and it's written by-
By Elizabeth Blackwell.
- You know of her?
- I heard her speak in Boston.
I can't imagine what it must be like
to hear her speak in person.
You sound like you greatly admire her.
She's done so much to pave the way
for women to become doctors.
Ah. And that's
what you want to be.
I'll be fortunate if I'm able
to train to be a nurse.
The schooling for doctors
is terribly expensive.
- You moved your arm.
- Your powers of observation are remarkable.
This calls for a cup of tea.
Now, imagine this is
your favorite Earl Grey.
See if you can lift your arm
enough to take it.
What, like a dog doing tricks?
Like a woman who wants
her independence back.
You are a very
impertinent young woman.
And you are a very difficult patient.
We'll try again in the morning.
Who is Charles Dickens?
A very talented author.
You can borrow the book if you like.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Mrs. Tyler.
All right.
Hello, boys.
What can I do for you?
- Mom needs some flour.
- All right. What kind?
- She usually has wheat.
- Wheat's good.
All right- Ow!
- You okay, Mr. Browne?
-
- Mr. Browne!
- Dad! Mr. Browne is ill!
George?
George needs you
to take a look at him.
He's got a pain.
He can't even stand up straight.
Get him up on the table
and I'll look at him.
Mm-hmm.
All right, George.
You been vomiting, huh?
- Yeah.
-
Well, you don't have a fever.
- You been into the, uh- the candy again?
- Well-
-
- Aah!
I got to get back to the office.
If you need anything, let me know, Doc.
- All right. Thanks, Zach.
- Bye, Daddy.
Uh...
would you get my watch over there
on the desk, Belinda, and take his pulse.
Checking for rebound tenderness?
Well, if you're so smart,
what am I doing now?
- Using McBurney's point method
to diagnose what's wrong.
- Aah!
- One twenty-five.
- And I suppose you have an opinion?
I think he has acute appendicitis.
He probably needs surgery.
If he has an appendicitis attack...
it's not bad enough
to warrant surgery.
- But if his appendix were to burst, Doctor-
- Burst?
J-J-Just calm down, George.
There's nothing to worry about now.
- You can get up.
- All right.
Look, if you get a fever
or if the pain gets considerably worse...
you come and see me,
even if it's in the middle of the night.
You take a teaspoon of this three times a day
till the pain goes away.
And, George,
you stay out of that candy jar.
- You're a grown man, not a five-year-old.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Much obliged.
Now listen here, young lady.
A good doctor never performs
an unnecessary surgery.
It's too risky,
unless the patient will die without it.
But he had all the symptoms.
If he had acute appendicitis...
George would have been
right off this table from the pain.
Mama, what's this word?
"Capture."
And this one?
Elephant.
It says, " Then they went out...
to capture the wild elephant."
How do you know
what that says, Sadie?
Mom is learning to read
at school with me, Pa. She's real good.
Charles.
I am blessed, that's for sure.
I thank God every day that he saw fit
to put me and Marty together.
- When did you first know you loved her?
- That's easy.
I felt a terrible emptiness inside of me.
And I knew that if I didn't get her back,
nothing would ever fill that up again.
That's a pretty clear sign.
I thought so.
What about you, though?
Tell me about that life
you gotta get back to.
- You got a young lady waiting for you?
- No.
My father thought I should concentrate on
school before getting serious about anybody.
- He may be right.
- He's always right.
Sounds like a man
who's pretty sure of himself.
If he's ever had a moment's doubt,
he hasn't admitted it.
- Considers it a weakness, I'll bet.
-
He says if someone senses weakness in you,
that's when they go in for the kill.
That's a pretty harsh way
to look at life.
Now, we can both go up on that roof...
and you can find a way
to hurt yourself again...
or you can take the wagon into town,
pick up those supplies we ordered.
That's an easy choice, sir.
Charles?
Yeah?
Heard what happened with your wife.
You mean your wife.
She tricked me.
I'm not apologizing for Missie.
She was acting out of kindness,
and with the honest intent to help.
I don't see how this has anything
to do with you, Sheriff...
unless there's some new law
about reading that I don't know about.
You know, there's no shame
in not being able to read.
Good day.
I know it hurts, but that's a good sign.
It means your nerves are kicking back in.
- If you just try a little bit harder-
- I  trying!
You're giving up too easily!
Who do you think you are
to talk to me that way!
I may not have a college education,
but I'm well-read and definitely not ignorant.
As for class, I come from a good family that
could teach you what that word really means.
- Get out of my sight.
- With pleasure.
Windsor!
Miss Belinda!
Miss Belinda, please! Wait up.
Wait up, Miss Belinda.
Miss Belinda!
I'm sorry, Mr. Windsor. I know you're used
to taking her abuse, but I'm not about to.
Mrs. Stafford-Smith would never
mean to be abusive to you, Miss.
I don't know what you call it back East, but here
we call it rude and unacceptable behavior.
May I share something of
a personal matter with you, Miss Tyler?
There's something
I'd like to show you.
This is Benjamin and Lucy,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith's children.
- I thought she didn't have any children.
- She doesn't now.
Oh, I see.
Mrs. Stafford-Smith became a widower
shortly after Lucy was born.
Her children became everything
in her life, Miss.
What happened to them?
Lucy passed away when
she was five of scarlet fever.
How terrible.
When Mrs. Stafford-Smith lost Lucy...
the only thing that
kept her going was Benjamin.
And when she lost him I was afraid she-
I'm so sorry.
That explains her anger and bitterness,
but that doesn't excuse her behavior.
I just want you to understand that Mrs.
Stafford-Smith was not always the way she is.
She was a kind and generous woman.
Try to think of her the way she was,
before unbearable loss changed her.
Try to see her with a forgiving heart
and not a judgmental mind.
Come in.
What are you doing back here?
I want to apologize to you,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
It was inexcusable for me
to speak to a patient like that...
no matter how challenging you are.
This submissive demeanor
is out of character for you.
Does it have anything to do
with Windsor rushing out after you?
He told me a little bit about your background,
but please do not be angry with him.
He knows better than
to discuss my private life.
He's devoted to you.
I don't need anyone to help me.
We all need someone.
I lost my mother, father
and baby sister.
When I was nine my little brother Jacob and I
had to go live in an orphanage.
- How did you get here?
- An orphan train.
They go from town to town
giving kids to whoever want them.
Sometimes they're good families
and sometimes they're not.
If it wasn't for Missie and Zach,
me and Jacob would be separated forever.
I'm sorry for you, Belinda.
But now you know
why I turned from God.
- No, I don't.
- How can you still have faith?
I know we never really die.
I'm connected to the people I love in life,
and I know we're still connected in death.
A comforting thought if you
can believe in fairy tales, which I can't.
That's enough for today.
You may go.
Whoa.
- Hi!
- Belinda.
I was visiting my grandma
and she wanted me to bring lunch to y'all.
I'll just leave this here then.
Uh, wait. Why don't you stay
and visit a while.
I can't. I should be getting
back to the clinic.
Well, I was thinking that maybe, uh,
we could have lunch at the hotel sometime.
- I'd like that.
- Tomorrow?
Well...
sure.
- Evening, Charles.
- Evening, Mr. Davis.
Drew Simpson is fixing up his uncle's place.
He could use some help.
He'll pay you a good wage, and I thought
you might be interested in the job.
- Can I work around my hours at the store?
- You bet.
All right then.
I'll be there right after lunch.
- I'll see you then.
- All right.
Mr. Davis.
Thank you, sir.
I really appreciate the work.
You're welcome, Charles.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I envy you your faith, Belinda,
but I can't share it.
And even if I could,
it doesn't change the fact...
that the only reason I didn't
let that stroke kill me...
is my distant relatives
who are just waiting for me to die...
so that they can inherit my fortune.
I think the whole reason your stroke
didn't kill you is 'cause God has work for you.
- You find a purpose by loving other people.
- And losing them.
The fact that you grieve deeply
means you love deeply.
There are so many people out there
who need what you have.
- Who would that be?
- At the orphanage...
there's hundreds of children without parents
or parents who simply give them away.
Ah, so you're suggesting I give money.
Not just money.
Yourself.
Aren't we supposed to be practicing?
Reach for the teacup.
One hand.
Best cup of tea I ever had.
-
-
- That'll do it.
-
Thanks again, Charles. I'm not sure
what I would have done without you.
You're more than welcome,
Mr. Simpson.
Drew.
All right. Drew.
May I ask you a question?
About the law?
Sure.
It's about adoption.
You and your wife
thinking about adopting a child?
You and your wife
thinking about adopting a child?
Well, not exactly.
Sadie was married before we met.
And her first husband,
he was Caleb's pa.
He used to beat Sadie and Caleb both.
- She divorce him?
- Yeah.
He got in a bar fight and he hurt some fella
real bad, and they put him prison.
Gave Sadie a chance to get away,
but he's fixing to get out soon.
And I know he's gonna
come looking for Caleb.
Now, if I can adopt him...
does that make him my boy,
and then ain't nobody can take him away?
That's right.
Sadie's awful worried that
he won't give up his claim to Caleb.
Well, under normal circumstances,
he'd have to agree to it.
But because he's been in prison...
there's no way the court
would favor him over you.
- You sure about that?
- Well, I'll draw up the papers to petition the court.
We'll see what the judge has to say.
- Well, now, I can't pay you right now, but-
- You don't have to.
- Well, I don't take charity.
- Consider it part of your wages for working here.
Like a- a bonus
for doing a really good job.
All right.
- Thank you, Drew.
- It's my pleasure, Charles.
I just passed the bar.
- When I return home,
I'll join my father's practice.
- Does he practice criminal law?
Nothing nearly so unsavory.
No, he handles mostly contracts,
wills, trusts, that sort of thing.
My father represents some
of the wealthiest people in New York.
So you'll only be helping the rich people.
- That's who our clients are.
- They don't have to be.
You could help the less fortunate.
We work with people
who pay our fees.
- Is that all you care about- money?
-
Don't be ridiculous.
That's not what I meant.
It seems to me you don't
have a real passion for law.
Well, the definition of law
is reason free from passion.
Do you have time to take a walk?
- I should be getting back to Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
- A short one?
So, do you really want to be a lawyer,
or was it simply expected of you?
It was always understood that I would
follow in my father's footsteps, yes.
What does your mother think?
Or doesn't her opinion matter?
Oh, her opinion would matter
a great deal if she were still alive.
- She died when I was eight.
- Oh, I had no idea. I'm so sorry, Drew.
You know,
for a long time after she died...
I used to play this little game
every time I left the house.
hidin' somewhere waiting
for me to find her.
The only thing I ever wanted was my mother
to be there when I came home.
- You're privileged to have both your parents.
- Actually, I was adopted.
I would have never guessed
they're not really your family.
- I mean, not that-
-  It's all right.
At first I didn't feel like
they were my family.
They made me realize that loving someone
has nothing to do with being related...
and everything to do with opening your heart
and letting someone in.
I envy the relationship
you have with your family.
- Why?
- You really love each other.
I haven't felt that
since my mother died.
That sense of security of knowing-
Knowing that someone'll
always be there for you.
You'll never be completely
on your own again.
Yes.
Exactly.
You see?
My, my, my...
you have made remarkable progress,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
I must say, I am very impressed.
Nor did I think so, but Belinda
was stubborn about my therapy.
but she never gave up on me.
She's a remarkable young woman,
don't you think, Doctor?
Yes.
Yes, she is, indeed.
I know you must be anxious
to get back to Boston...
and I think you can start
planning to go home now.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
It seems while I wasn't looking,
my life just got really complicated.
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Drew Simpson, would it?
I'm attracted to him and it's not fair.
- To you or to him?
-
He's becoming a distraction.
I can't let that happen.
Only a few years ago I knew
just how to get answers to my questions.
You wish it was simple again
like when you were a child?
You could say a heartfelt prayer to God
and then just listen for his guidance.
Yes.
Belinda, it's still that simple.
Drew, you wanna take a break?
What? Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.
- Somethin' weighin' on your mind?
- No, nothing.
Have you ever had that experience
where you think a person is one way...
and they turn out
to be something else entirely?
I think we've all had that experience
at one time-
I had Belinda all figured out.
Then I get thrown for a loop.
- And that's bad?
- Well, it's... complicated.
- She makes me think about things
I thought were all settled.
- Such as?
Where I'm going to live,
what I'm going to do.
Even whether or not my life
has any real meaning or purpose.
Well, a woman can do that to a man.
I know what I want to do with my life.
I want to sell this place,
go back to New York...
- Well, in that case, what is the problem?
- Belinda is the problem.
I don't want to think about her.
I don't want to get involved with her.
She's nothing like the kind of woman
I have planned for my future.
She's opinionated...
outspoken, strong-willed...
smart, kind.
That doesn't sound like a problem, son.
That sounds like an opportunity.
Whoa.
Oh, it's not your hand again.
It's my finger.
I think it's broken.
There ought to be
a law against giving you a hammer, son.
For your information, the first time
I hurt myself, it was on a wire.
Maybe you should stick
to lawyering. Hmm.
Belinda, why don't you, uh,
look at the boy's hand.
Can you bend it?
I guess I can.
I think it's just a bruise.
I could splint it if it's broken.
It might be quite cumbersome.
Just leave it.
Have lunch at the hotel
with me today.
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Tomorrow then?
I have Mrs. Stafford-Smith to tend to.
- Well, maybe we could find time-
- Do you want the splint?
What? No. No splint.
Then excuse me.
I have work to finish.
Belinda, wait.
I have to get home, Drew.
I have things to do.
Why are you being like this?
What happened?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.
When the farm sells,
you'll be moving back to New York, right?
Well, yes.
And I'll be staying here.
So where does that leave us?
Meeting with rich clients
in a big office...
dancing with well-bred girls
in satin gowns.
After a while,
you won't even remember me.
Hand me that, please.
- Come on, Drifter.
-
Well, let's see who that is.
- Hey, Charles.
- Evening, Sheriff. Awful sorry
to interrupt your family meal.
Would you like to join us, Charles?
Oh, no, thank you, ma'am. I just came
to drop this by. It's for Miss Belinda.
It seems Drew hurt himself again.
I better go check on him.
I'll be back as soon as I can, Mama.
- Thank you, Charles.
- Sheriff.
Drew?
What?
- I believe this belonged to my aunt.
- ##
Probably meant
a great deal to my uncle.
This isn't a fancy ballroom.
There isn't an orchestra.
But if I can have this dance...
I promise you, Belinda,
that I will never forget it.
You know this doesn't
change anything, Drew.
- I think it changes everything.
- I should go in.
- I don't think-
- Tomorrow.
Hyah!
I'm very happy for you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
but I am gonna miss you.
I'd like you to come with me, Belinda.
If you're worried about
the travel, Mister-
No, I'm not looking
for a traveling companion.
I'd like you to come back
to Boston and live with me.
Take me to that orphanage.
I'd like to meet those children.
You don't need me to take you there.
I'll just get you the name of the orphanage.
No.
Well, Belinda, there's more.
I would like to pay your way
through college and medical school.
That's a much too generous offer,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
- Why on earth not?
- Because it would take me years
and years to pay you back.
Well, it's not a loan, it's a gift.
I'm a very wealthy woman.
I can afford to do this for you.
I would like to think,
if my Lucy had lived...
she might have grown up
to be just like you, Belinda.
Even if I could accept your offer,
they'd never accept me into a good college.
Most of the schools
don't even allow women.
Oh, posh! I'll just send up a smoke signal
to my friend Sam Gregory.
Dr. Samuel Gregory?
The Dr. Samuel Gregory...
who founded Boston University
School of Medicine?
Yes. One and the same.
I don't know what to say.
Well, say yes!
Thank you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
Thank you!
But when I leave next week...
I hope you'll be with me.
I think it is the opportunity
of a lifetime, Lindy.
But Boston is very far away.
And we'd certainly miss you.
And I'm gonna miss you and Papa and Grandpa
and Maddie and Jacob.
- I can't leave Jacob.
- We'll take good care of him.
Besides, we all knew you were going to
have to leave Anderson Corner one day...
if you were going to get
a good education.
It scares me about thinking
of leaving everyone.
When I came out here from back East,
I was scared too.
So was I. When I left with my first husband
Willie, I had no idea what lay ahead.
The only thing I knew was that
I was leaving the only home I'd ever known.
How'd you both do it?
When you face the unknown, you have to
gather every ounce of courage you possess.
Then tell yourself if it's the right thing to do,
everything will work out fine.
And if it doesn't,
you can always come home.
- So you think I should go?
- I think you should do what
your mama and I both did.
Belinda.
What a wonderful surprise.
I can only stay a moment, Drew.
Something entirely unexpected's
happened and I wanted to let you know.
- I hope it's something good.
- Actually, it's amazing.
Mrs. Stafford-Smith has asked me to go to Boston
with her. She's gonna put me through school.
That's incredible.
I know what it must mean to you.
You know, Boston isn't that far
from New York. Maybe we could-
That's just it, Drew.
- No, we can't.
- Why not?
As soon as I get my medical degree,
I'll be coming back here...
practicing with Doc and hopefully
taking over for him someday.
You may change your mind when you get
to Boston. It has a great deal to offer.
It doesn't have what Anderson Corner does:
my family, people who really need me.
- They probably won't have
a doctor when Doc's gone.
- Belinda, we can work this out.
I've thought hard about this, Drew.
I've prayed even harder.
The only way we could be together is
if one of us is miserable.
- Belinda.
- I said what I came here to say.
Belinda.
Belinda!
- Who is it?
- Jonas Barnes.
- It's gonna have to come off at the knee.
- Will surgery save his life?
But if I don't do it,
he'll die within the day.
I can help.
Belinda...
this is life-threatening,
gruesome surgery.
- I can handle it, Doc.
-
Cora, I need you to wait outside.
I'll come get you as soon as we're done.
All right, Jonas.
I think we're ready to start.
Maybe you could say
a little prayer first.
Of course.
Uh, Belinda.
Lord, we are eternally grateful
that you are here with us now.
And pray that you bless Doc
with a steady hand...
and bless Jonas
with a peaceful heart...
and Cora with the knowledge
that you are in control of this day.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- All right, I need you to lay back there now.
- Count to 10 with me, okay?
- Okay.
- One...
-
- two...
- two...
-
-
- four...
- four...
- five...
- five...
six, seven, eight-
- All right.
- He's out.
Okay. All right.
All right.
This starts the process
to make you legally Caleb's father.
I'll just need you to sign there,
and then I'll file the paper with the court.
You really think the judge
will grant the adoption?
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be an open-and-shut case.
- Your turn, Charles.
-
I'm afraid not. You just
put your "X" right there.
Very good.
You know, you're my first client.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to be going.
Thank you so much, Drew.
I really appreciate it.
You're more than welcome.
Thank you, Sadie.
Charles, we haven't talked about what
happened with Caleb. l- I want to explain.
No, you don't have to, Sadie.
I'm sorry I went behind your back.
I reckon if you learned how to read,
you'd see that there's...
a whole lot more out there
than what I can give you and Caleb.
Charles, you are the finest man
I've ever known.
I don't know what Caleb
and I would have done without you.
Oh, Sadie, I love you both so much.
And I'd be mighty proud
to give Caleb my name.
But l- I wonder if he's
gonna be ashamed of me.
You know what would make
your son proud of you, Charles?
Seein' that his father had the courage
to do something very hard...
all because he loves his son so much.
If I can do it...
I  you can, Charles.
Sure would be nice to be able to read
that piece of paper that says I'm Caleb's pa.
Think she might teach us together?
Hmm? What happened?
- You mustn't move, Mr. Barnes.
- Cora.
-
- Mr. Barnes. Mr. Barnes.
Cora!
-
- Mr. Barnes!
-
-
- What happened?
- He got scared. He started asking for Cora.
- I tried to stop him, Doc. I'm so sorry!
- It's all right.
Go get some bandages.
Hurry. Hurry!
All right, Jonas, we're gonna
get you back into bed now. Okay?
-
-
-
- Just calm down. Calm down.
- Jonas, it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
-
Listen to me, Jonas.
You have to relax. Jonas!
Shh, shh. All right. Shh.
You have to relax.
Jonas.
Oh, Jonas.
Please don't do this.
- Aw.
-
Oh, Jonas.
Hi, Lindy.
Boys, go outside, please.
You poor dear.
I tried, Grandma.
I really did.
He was so strong. How could he be so strong
after what he went through?
He was very frightened.
Fear can do that.
I haven't seen anyone die
since my mom and baby sister.
It was so horrible to see the life
drain out of him so fast.
- I'm so sorry, darling.
- It was so awful.
It wasn't your fault, Belinda.
It's okay.
But once he gets past the sadness
and frustration he must feel...
he will tell you
it wasn't your fault.
If it wasn't my fault,
then why do I feel like it is?
Because you care deeply
about people...
and that's what makes you
hurt for them.
And that is also what
will make you a good doctor.
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a doctor after all.
I'll just stay here and be Doc's assistant,
if he'll let me.
- Belinda, you can't mean that.
- I'm afraid I do.
No-
Whoa.
Hello, Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
Did you tell Belinda it was
her fault that poor man died?
- Of course not.
- Did you tell her it wasn't?
Well, you don't mean that-
- Well, I didn't think-
- Exactly!
All right. That oughta do it.
I don't think you'll
have any trouble finding a buyer now.
I already know the buyer I want.
Charles, would you and Sadie
like to take this place?
We could never afford a place like this.
You could if I loaned you the money.
We could never accept a loan that big.
What if we called it a mortgage,
except you could pay it off as you can.
You showed me how good
it feels to practice the law...
when I'm helping someone
who really needs it.
Yeah. Yes. Yes, I will.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeehaw!
-
Oh, that's mighty nice of you, son.
Mighty nice.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.
Doc?
Doc, are you here?
Dear Doc, I am so sorry to have let you down.
But you were right.
I don't have what it takes to be a doctor.
- Can I help?
- She can barely breathe.
We have to get her to Doc.
Hold onto her.
Come on, boys.
Where's the doctor?
- Uh, he's not here.
- Belinda, I need your help.
You have to help her!
She's turning blue!
I don't know what to do,
Caroline. I'm sorry.
- You're her only chance right now.
-
This is your destiny, right?
-
- Please!
Okay. Okay, think.
Okay, trouble breathin'.
What is it?
What's wrong with my baby?
It could be a number of things.
If my diagnosis is wrong-
- Please, Belinda!
-
Okay.
You gotta open your mouth, all right?
There's an abscess
in the area around the tonsils.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It could be quinsy.
- Is there medicine for it?
- No. There's only one thing to do.
- I have to lance her throat.
- Then do it!
I've never done this procedure
before or anything like this.
I'll help you. Whatever I can do.
What can I do?
Okay, get the tray
and get the mask.
Okay, wet this.
- Okay.
-
Put this on her mouth
for five seconds.
Five seconds.
One, two, three...
four, five.
You gotta hold her head still
so she won't move.
Dear God, guide my hand.
Looks like she'll be fine.
Belinda, what you did-
It could have gone the other way.
I could have lost her, Drew.
But you didn't.
You were smart enough to figure out what to do
and brave enough to do it.
I was terrified the whole time.
- It didn't stop you.
-
What's happened? What is it?
Belinda saved my daughter's life.
How are you?
Open up for me.
Well, I bet that throat is really sore, huh?
Good excuse for your mama
to churn some fresh buttermilk for ya.
- I sure will.
-
But I didn't save Jonas's.
Yes, um, about that.
I owe you a very big apology.
Jonas's death wasn't your fault.
But I couldn't hold him still.
But that's not why he died.
We were trying to save him,
but unfortunately...
the surgery was
just too much for him.
I told you how difficult
it is losing a patient.
and it never gets any easier.
When it hurts this much...
it just means that...
you care that much more
about your patients.
Um, I don't think
I'm cut out to be a doctor.
Oh, yes, you are, young lady.
But you just make darn sure that
you come back here when you're a doctor.
Doc-
Well, now...
don't start crying or I'll-
I'll think I made
a mistake after all.
Whoa.
That's for having more faith in me
than I had in myself.
Come on. Hup.
Are you sure you don't want us
to see you off at the stagecoach?
I'd rather we say good-bye here.
You know, by train Boston
isn't as far as it once seemed.
Mm-hmm.
- Are you all right, Belinda?
- Yes, Mama, I'm fine.
No second thoughts about leaving
with Mrs. Stafford-Smith?
No, not anymore.
I feel at peace with my decision.
So your second thoughts
are about Drew?
I love him, Mama.
I really do.
But it could never work.
Sometimes one dream
is all you can have.
- Whoa. Whoa.
-
- Morning.
- Mornin'.
I just wanted to say good-bye, Clark,
and thank you for everything.
- You headed home?
- Charles and Sadie are moving onto the farm.
I'm headed... back
to New York tomorrow.
We said our good-byes
with Missie this mornin'.
She's probably getting
on the stage right about now.
You asked me once
when I knew I loved Marty.
- But you never asked me what I did about it.
- What was that?
She left on a wagon train.
She was going back home.
I went after her.
If you love someone, if you truly love them,
you don't let them go.
- I've learned a lot from you.
- Then what are you doing still standing here?
Don't you have a stage to catch?
Last call, Denver stage!
All aboard, folks!
-
- Come on.
Whoa. Belinda!
Oh, my goodness.
Don't go!
I'll practice in Boston while you're in school.
Then we'll come back here.
You'd be happy practicing law
in Anderson Corner?
Anderson Corner is the place
I learned to love the law, and it has you.
I don't think I could be
truly happy anywhere else.
- This isn't your world, Drew.
- You're my world.
I love you, Belinda.
Marry me.
Oh, there's a train back to Boston most every day.
You'll catch one next week.
Windsor will meet you at the depot.
Won't you, Windsor?
I'd love to marry you, Drew.
Do you, Andrew, take Belinda
to be your lawfully wedded wife...
- I do.
-
-
- I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You do look happy.
-
-
Bye.
Mmm. Be safe.
You know I will.
You know I will.
Take care, son.
- Thank you so much.
- Bless you.
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Take care, honey.
Come here, Jacob.
Be good.
Marty.
Take care.
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.
- Take care of my girl.
- Will do.
You ready?
Bye.
Giddap!
Bye!
- Love you!
-  Bye!
Love you!
