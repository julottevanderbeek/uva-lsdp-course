Ma! Señora Nunez came in.
She's burning up with fever.
Go cool her head.
Recite the 23rd Psalm.
l'll be there in a bit.
New Mexico, 1 885
''Though l walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, l fear no evil.''
-Morning, kids.
-''Thou art with me. Thy rod and staff...
...they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.''
Darling, get me some Cocea paste
and my tooth plier, please.
Yes, ma'am.
No. No.
She don't worry about the pain. No.
lt is her only tooth.
She worry how she look.
Thank you.
Thank you.
l need you to hold
your grandmother down.
Darling, can you hold her arm?
Pin that, Dot. Hold her nose.
Hold her nose.
Careful.
l hate to ask...
...but can you pay me for this today?
Jumping  coyotes
sons of bitches.
That lightning sure did kill her.
This calf won't last the night out here.
Let's put her in the barn.
Señor Brake.
lndian.
Apache, maybe.
Some kind of Apache
son of a bitch.
Good day, sir.
l said, hello.
That your man over there
in the trees?
What is he planning on doing
with that carbine?
We've had trouble
with coyotes killing calves.
Tell him l'm not a coyote.
ls that the healer's place?
You come for doctoring?
Lady shuts her doors at sundown.
She's pretty firm about her hours.
You're welcome to spend the night,
see her in the morning.
l thank you kindly.
Barn's this way, mister.
There's a spare bunk
over there, Mr....
Mr. Fernandez.
Jones. The man that owned
that saddle tried to kill me.
l was living with the Jicarilla. l
suppose he thought l was one of them.
You're Apache, huh?
-What did you say?
-Forget it.
What did you say?
Come over here.
Now, l mean it!
There'll be no trouble here.
lf that's too tough for you to
understand, you can move on.
Emiliano, unpack his mule.
You will keep your hands
off of my mule...
...Emiliano.
-Don't slam that door.
-Yes, ma'am.
There are houses in Cleveland
with lamps that run on electricity.
l'd like to see Cleveland.
-Can you fetch the water, please, Dot?
-Yes, ma'am.
At the fair, there's gonna be
expositions of the future.
There's gonna be a graphophone. You
can hear your own voice back on it.
-The Dickersons are going.
-Brake can't spare you.
-Ma.
-Not tomorrow with the cows calving.
-The Fosters too.
-Got all the future you need right here.
Riding all day with this
cramping and all.
Don't you ever act helpless
and pitiable to win favor with a man.
Some people shouldn't give advice
on how to act with men.
-And it's ''pitiful'' in English.
-You heard what l said.
That pail's half-empty.
l didn't do it. lt's that old lndian's
dumb old mule.
-What lndian?
-Some drifter looking for doctoring.
lf you're gonna eat barefoot...
...why not take supper
with the animals in the barn.
My boots don't fit no more.
Cut off my blood circulation.
-lt's your birthday soon.
-l'll have gangrene by then.
Your mother may have to saw off your
feet, then. Like poor old Mr. Swenson.
Mr. Jones.
Maggie, this is the visiting gentleman
l mentioned.
l'll bet a warm meal
sounds pretty good to you.
Magdalena.
l'm afraid we have
just enough food for family.
We can't be offering
our hospitality tonight.
-l'm sure we can all do with less.
-l'm sure we can't!
l have two growing girls to feed.
Maggie?
Maggie.
Lilly, why don't you say grace.
Who is he?
Called you Magdalena.
Your hair bristles
when you lay eyes on him.
He scares me, is all.
-Nobody scares you.
-Can't trust him.
Maggie, who is he?
He's my father.
-l thought your father was dead.
-He is.
To me, he is.
l want him gone, Brake.
Gone? He's your kin.
You just can't--
He ran off when l wasn't Dot's age.
Went lndian.
Turn your back,
he'll eat your horses and dogs.
He's being chased...
...or running from something,
l don't know what.
But he's bad, Brake. l swear.
l do not want him
near my children.
We're lndians, Lilly.
We're lndians.
Does he do that all night?
Oh, he's just getting started.
-You come here for the healing?
-ln a manner of speaking.
Thought you might be hungry.
-lt's rabbit stew.
-l can't eat rabbits.
l was bitten by a rattlesnake.
All right.
When there's company,
you sleep in there. ls that right?
That's right.
-You're not her husband?
-No, sir.
Not for lack of asking.
They your children?
No.
What happened to their father?
You don't know this?
l can't say what all happened
between you two...
...but you ain't welcome here.
But she's a good Christian.
She won't turn away any man
in need.
Tomorrow, she'll give you
what doctoring she can...
...then you're on your way.
There's places where a father
would kill a man...
...for doing what you're doing,
you know that, don't you?
lf you have something to say, say it.
Are you really a lndian?
Brake said you rode
with the Chiricahua.
That's right.
-So that means l'm part lndian, right?
-No.
Not at all.
You look stupid trying to work
in those fancy clothes, you know.
l am leaving here as soon as l can.
-l'm moving to the city.
-But Grandpa's visiting.
Did you see him?
He's a savage.
They're gut-eaters, you know.
l was born into the wrong family,
l swear to God l was.
-l appreciate this.
-Take off your shirt.
-Magdalena--
-Don't call me that. lt's not my name.
-Where's it hurt?
-Hurts when l breathe.
Mostly around here.
Yeah. Your muscles are torn
just under your ribs.
You need to put
a cottonwood plaster to it.
You'll live.
l never thought you'd turn out
to be a healer.
l remember you had
that yellow cat one time.
You cried because a badger
bit its tail off.
-Your mother came running--
-Don't remember. Not in front of me.
Because l remember my mother.
My mother died
scrubbing a man's floor.
And you killed her.
Didn't shoot her or stab her,
but what you did....
You broke her!
And l remember my brother too.
He lasted six years.
l bet you never even knew his name.
And l remember praying hard
every night that you'd come home.
On the day l put him
in the ground...
...l remember praying even harder
you were dead.
So you don't want to reminisce
with me, that l promise you.
l earned this money in large part...
...killing mountain lions for ranchers
like you. l want you to have it.
lf l were destitute
and drawing my last breath--
This is good money.
Take it for your children.
-Take it for your funeral.
-Magdalena.
l've done my duty as a Christian.
You get the hell off my ranch!
l'd stop now.
Maggie asked you to leave.
l think it's time you did so, sir.
Right about now.
So long.
Nice making your acquaintance.
What's done is done, l guess.
l know you would have
done different.
l appreciate your regard, Brake.
l do.
Well, night, then.
Did they see you come in?
We can't make a sound.
Figure we can get them
all branded in a day?
-You want Dot to stay for company?
-Brake, you said l could go.
You promised.
Mama, you promised too.
Oh, l'm fine.
He won't be coming back.
This will help the cramping.
The calves are more important...
...than hearing your voice
come out of a machine.
Well, l guess you never had anything
but this. So why should l?
Come on, let's get going.
You sure look frilly
to be working cattle.
l'll keep an eye on them.
-Just be home before dark.
-All right.
All right.
Easy now.
That's right.
Dot?
Dot?
Darling?
Get! Get!
Dot?
No!
No!
Dot!
Oh, Lord. Darling.
Mama, l'm cold.
-l'm here, darling. Are you all right?
-l'm cold. l'm cold.
-Mama, l'm cold.
-Darling, where's Lilly?
-Emiliano.
-Yeah, l know.
Darling, where's Lilly?
Emiliano and me...
...we was in the arroyo.
We heard shots from where Brake
and Lilly was.
He told me, ''Stay down''...
...Emiliano did.
''Don't move. Stay down.''
He went to see...
...but he didn't come back.
l waited like he said,
but he didn't come back.
Brake was screaming, Mama.
He screamed so long
l wanted him to stop.
l know. l know it.
-l know it.
-Then he did.
Then someone rode away with Lilly.
l wanted him to stop!
l know it. l know it.
Darling, did you see who?
Who took your sister?
He wore a hood.
He was lndian.
l'm sorry for your loss, ma'am, but l'm
afraid you got the wrong fella in mind.
l've had the man you're describing
in jail since last night.
Sold himself a lion's hide
and got quite a drunk on.
Unacceptable drunk.
He did say he was staying out
by your place, though.
There's been raids like this
on people here lately...
...in Arizona and New Mexico.
Some Apaches jumped the reservation
at San Carlos middle of last month.
We've been getting communications
about them near every day.
To Fort Bowie.
From me.
Possible your hostiles
attacked local ranch.
Two dead, one girl missing.
Named....
Lilly Gilkeson.
Lilly Gilkeson.
Stop.
This takes just a moment.
The device is truly a miracle.
And now you'll hear your voice back
as clear as day.
-Ladies.
-My name's Louise Dewey.
To Sheriff Purdy...
...of Chloride.
Believe hostiles...
...headed northwest...
...toward Colorado River.
Fourth Cavalry...
...will pursue...
...in due course.
Well, there you have it.
l'll send the undertaker out...
-...for the remains.
-You're not going after them?
Not under the present
circumstances, ma'am.
With the fair in town, l need
all the men l have right here.
lf you don't follow now,
their trail will get cold.
The Army is handling the situation.
They have Apache scouts.
Takes an Apache to catch an Apache.
lf someone doesn't go now,
my daughter may be dead.
Ma'am, l am elected to keep vigil
over this town of ours.
Just one or two men, sir,
that's all l'm asking.
Ma'am, l am sorry.
Seth, l need a word with you.
lt was the lndians did it.
Now, ladies, l will not authorize
fireworks until a water wagon is here.
Ma'am, that's the drunkard
from last night.
What would you like me
to do with him?
Let him go.
l don't care.
Mama?
Darling.
l want you to ride to the Handys'...
-No. No, l won't.
-...and stay there till l get back.
l won't stay behind. l'll follow you as
soon as you're gone, you know l will.
-Darling--
-l'm not-- You can't leave me, Ma.
l'm going with you, Mama,
please, l am.
-Now, you hear me, Dot--
-l'm not staying behind.
Wherever you put me,
l'm coming after you, Ma.
You know l'm not gonna stay put.
l swear to God, l won't stay put.
Hush, hush.
Hush, now. lt's all right.
Hush.
The Army's headed
in the wrong direction.
Seventeen horse tracks.
Three shod, one outrider,
two cavalry horses.
Six horses were tied together...
...carrying light loads.
Probably young women, children.
And their captives...
...those are being led along...
...like packhorses.
They're headed south.
Not north.
Probably trying to make it
to the Mexican border.
The Apaches sell a lot of girls
over there.
Top dollar.
Can you track them?
You can track them. But if you catch
them, you'll wish you'd stayed home.
l don't wanna catch them.
Keep me on the trail till l get the Army
down to Fort Selden to catch them.
You wanted to give me money.
Do this instead.
Taking this child out there is foolish.
l know my daughter.
-Leave her behind, she'll just follow.
-No way to care for a girl.
What would you know about any of it?
l'll be just fine, thank you.
Come on, now.
Pretty moon, Anne.
Old Bob Hadley was supposed
to stop by tonight.
God.
Mama, l'm afraid in my room.
lt's just your fever giving you
bad dreams, honey.
You want Mama to sing you a song?
Your man didn't keep his rifle
very clean.
lf he wanted to marry you, though,
l guess that's something.
He's not all bad.
-Did you ever marry?
-Dot's father was my husband.
He built the ranch with me.
The notion of it was better
than the doing, l guess.
What about the other one's father?
Didn't get much of a look at him.
Maggie?
What you're doing,
you're doing for your own soul.
Because what you've done,
you can't undo.
You can all move now.
Sir...
...do you suppose it's safe for me
to be on my way now?
Mister, l don't suppose nothing.
You're theirs now.
They captured you.
Could you help me, please?
Go into the cave.
Bring picture-maker. Go!
Take them.
You're heartless.
l see you gentlemen are engaging
in a little frontier recreation out here.
No, these girls are going to market.
We ain't supposed to sully
the merchandise.
l can smell him from here.
l see you share a fondness for
the photographic arts like myself.
Where did you find
this squashed penis?
We captured him as a gift for you.
Sir, may l have the honor of posing
you with your captives, please?
He wants to take your picture.
Please, please.
That's perfect. Now...
-...very still.
-Help us. Help.
Please help us.
Look your best.
Lord, protect us.
Stay behind me.
-lndians.
-Yeah.
But not the way you're thinking.
ls there time enough to give
these men a proper Christian burial?
Dead's dead,
one way or the other.
l asked if there was time.
Yeah.
There's time.
Get in.
You must be the pride of your people.
And you of yours.
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
The two on the porch
have expired, lieutenant.
Ask him why he murdered those men.
l didn't murder anybody.
They were dead when l got here.
What are you doing in here?
My granddaughter was stolen two
days ago. l trailed her to this place.
What's her name?
You don't know your
granddaughter's name?
Well, her sister's name is Dot.
We found two horses with a bunch
of women's property in them.
Hang him.
-Other side!
-There he goes!
l didn't kill anyone!
-l said, l didn't kill anyone!
-Come out and show your hands!
-l am looking for my granddaughter!
-Then you tell me her damn name!
-l don't know her damn name!
-Lilly!
-Lilly Gilkeson.
-You know this lndian?
-He's no lndian.
-Damn well looks lndian to me.
No, he's a....
That's my father.
l've been hoping we'd find you, sir.
We need your help.
We tracked my daughter
south from Chloride.
They're heading toward Mexico.
Near as we can figure...
...they've hit six or seven homesteads
so far, including this one.
Army should've killed the heathens
when they had a chance.
They are Army, ma'am. Deserters.
Why, l thought they were Apache.
Apache scouts.
Formerly on Uncle Sam's payroll.
Like Happy Jim here.
-We use them to hunt other Apaches.
-The lndians were American soldiers?
Then a couple of months ago,
some of them turned...
...shot some white officers and jumped
the reservation in San Carlos.
The 4th Cavalry started all this
by hanging their chief.
Don't know what they were thinking.
What makes you think
they were thinking?
This whole territory's
gone topsy-turvy.
You got lndians running with whites,
whites running with lndians.
Get those prisoners moving!
Come on, squaw man.
Get on the way here.
Happy Jim.
You think because you're
wearing that coat
they won't put you on the prison train
to Florida with chains on your legs?
l don't know of Florida.
lt's a real swell shit-hole of a swamp.
You'll see.
White man, you don't look like
someone who gives good advice.
Break it up!
What's going on here?
l said, break it up.
-l found it first, lieutenant.
-Lying bastard!
Looks like God intended
you two to share.
Any man found looting...
...will have the value of their property
deducted from his pay.
They're enlisted men.
-Post two men over there.
-l'm going to camp down by the river.
lf l stay here long, l might misbehave.
--right over there.
Somebody might have to kill me.
Lieutenant?
l imagine you plan to ride first thing.
Would it be all right if my daughter
and l rode along with you?
Naturally, l'm quite concerned.
Ma'am, capturing those renegades
is the Army's highest priority.
-Yes, of course.
-Butcher a couple goats for supper!
-And l'm grateful.
-But that's the assignment of the 4th.
But the 4th is going
in the wrong direction.
l assure you, they'll be redirected
as soon as we reach Fort Stanton.
Stanton's three days away.
My daughter will be in Mexico by then.
l grieve for your situation, l truly do.
But my assignment is to return these
hostiles in my capture to Stanton...
...for their prompt
and immediate deportation.
-You like fish?
-Go water the horses.
-l watered them back at the--
-l'm not asking.
Don't make them too raw, please.
Very well, ma'am.
Lilly, she's...
...not the same as Dot.
She's not strong.
She gets hurt so easy.
Sage?
-What?
-For the fish.
l know l asked you
to get us to the Army--
l asked you if you wanted
some sage put on your fish.
Yeah. All right.
None for Dot.
We'll ride at first light in the morning.
lf we can catch up to them, l might
have enough money to buy her back.
lf they make it to Mexico...
...your child is lost.
Hey, that stuff will make you sick,
but l like it.
No, no, no, no. Whoa. That flash
behind her head bother you? lt's just--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no magic.
lt's an optical defect. A flaw.
A flaw. Flaw.
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.
Look at these.
Look at these. See?
l know where all the prettiest girls
live, from Arizona to Texas.
You pick the ones you want,
and l'll take you right to them. Look!
All the pretty girls, see? All of them!
l'll take you-- Look!
Take your bad luck to your grave.
What was that?
What did you just do?
l'll get it done.
Who of you can skin a deer?
Hey! Who of you can skin a deer?
Me. l can.
All right. Gotta gut her.
l can't see.
What is happening to me?
Somebody tell me.
What is happening?
l can't see. l can't see. Please!
Where's clubfoot going? l thought we
was dropping back down into Mexico.
Seven's an unlucky number for him.
He wants eight girls. We go now.
Shit!
Here.
Fill the packs with meat.
l gotta take Sally.
No, l gotta take my little girl.
No! She just needs water.
She's fine.
Shut up. She's dead now, mama.
-She's my baby.
-Shut up.
No!
No! No! No!
No, no, no, no.
No!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Trying to make a fool of me.
lt's gonna be all right.
l think my feet grew two sizes today.
Try these.
-They're beautiful.
-They were my wife's.
My grandmother?
No.
Mama!
-Mama!
-Dot?
You all right?
You get bit?
Did those snakes bite you?
No.
Mama, a dead man's in there.
Don't worry about that child.
Go on now.
Mama, look at his eyes.
-What happened to him?
-He lost control of his wagon.
Maybe he had a heart seizure.
He didn't have a heart seizure.
His heart's in that hole.
What's behind her head?
-Some people would think it's a sign.
-A good sign or bad sign?
lt wasn't a very good sign for him.
Come here.
-What are you doing?
-These are for protection.
The man who did this is a .
-A what?
-lt's a witch.
You need to wear one too.
You can believe in your witchcraft
and your impiety all you want.
l believe in what l've seen, girl.
Snakes belong on the ground.
This one hangs them in the air.
A man's heart holds his spirit. This
one digs it out and throws it in the dirt.
Don't you start this.
l know a  who'd put an arrow
in you a mile away.
l know a  who laid his hand
on a child one time. One time.
The child cramped up, fell down
and spit up bees till she died.
-You stop this. You're scaring her.
-She needs to be scared. So do you.
Mama, please. Please.
Just on her.
We gotta get through that canyon
before the storm hits.
You go on and l'll follow.
Give me some of the medical stuff
they stole, the laudanum.
You like that stuff.
You know, l drink enough
of this stuff, l swear...
-...you start to look good to me.
-Hey.
They give this to my grandma
when she was fixing to croak.
Mama!
Mama!
l'll get her!
Get those horses to higher ground!
l've got her!
Dot, you hold on to me!
My foot's caught!
Hold your breath! Right now!
Gotta piss.
Sit up.
l can get us out of here.
-Do you hear that?
-You mustn't speak.
My baby's calling me.
No. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
Your baby's passed on.
No. That's just how she sleeps.
There's nothing you can do,
so please just--
There, there. My baby.
Here. Watch out while l get
the horses.
Hey. Just going to get
those berries l promised you.
Don't wander off.
Lord, forgive me.
Stop squirming.
-Goddamn you!
-Give her to me.
-Get up!
-No!
-l got her.
-No!
-Tie her legs!
-Shut up!
Shut up!
Why?
Now we're gonna be back to seven,
and seven's an unlucky number.
Whore! Stop!
Thank you.
Crawl.
You're better than them,
but you're not better than me.
Can she have the moccasins now?
Yeah.
Can l just--?
l'm glad you were here.
l was bitten by a rattlesnake.
What?
A good shaman gave me
two amulets.
Told me not to eat
rabbit meat for a year...
...to say my prayers every morning...
...take care of my family,
and l might get well.
You're telling me the only
reason you came back...
...was because you were
following the say-so of some...
...medicine man. ls that right?
Yes. Absolutely. A rattlesnake
can make your soul...
...very sick.
That's likely not what
you want to hear.
But it is the truth.
We have eight girls. Now, we can go.
