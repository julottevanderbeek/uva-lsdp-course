I see why they call this place
"Hell On Wheels."
Rough men, loose women,
whiskey, sin, and guns.
It ain't
a church social, ma'am.
I'm not sure your bosses
at Credit Mobilier
would want me to put
in the newspaper.
What is it that holds you to
this enterprise, Mr. Bohannon?
Every piece of steel we lay
puts us closer
to somewheres else.
That's about all I can say.
So it's more personal
than just laying rail.
You're the writer.
Ho!
Mr. Bohannon,
people of this country
believe the railroad is robbing
the National Treasury.
My job is to dissuade my readers
of that notion.
Unfortunately,
our brief interview
was not enough to dissuade me.
And it ain't my job
to fix what people think.
In fact, it is.
You are the face of the
Transcontinental Railroad now.
And either this is
a brave and noble endeavor,
or it's Sodom and Gomorrah.
Which is it?
The sooner you help me
accurately report
what's going on out here,
the sooner I can leave
and make both our lives
less miserable.
And for the record,
I covered the war '63 to '65.
I know the difference between
hell and a church social.
What more you need to see?
Everything.
Come on then.
That I ever did see
that I ever did see

Grading crews work ahead
of the tie-layers.
surveyors lay out the route.
- How many men do you have?
- Near 3,000.
Work six days a week,
sunup, sundown.
$1.50 a day.
Them's good wages.
How many miles do you make
a day?
Two now,
weather and Indians permittin'.
Rust eaters lay the rails.
Walking boss makes sure
the gauge is right.
Spiker teams secure the rails
to the ground.
Fish-plates tie them together.
per spike,
Do you really believe
you can win the race
against the Central Pacific
to build this road?
Wouldn't be here otherwise.
You think you can do it
without Thomas Durant's
political connections?
Without his money,
his ego to drive it on?
Well, here I stand,
and here he don't.
- Excuse me.
- One more question.
Why you?
Each car sleeps 60 men.
Keeps them out of the weather
and close to the work.
Lady coming through.
Who designed these cars?
Mostly me.
Yeah, I'm still working out
the ventilation.
Mmhmm.
Two weeks ago, these men
were starving, out of work,
straight off the boats
in New York.
My newspaper has reported
Irish labor bosses
conscripting them out here
for a fee.
How is that any different
from indentured servitude?
Union Pacific offers
free rail passage
and a week's wages on arrival.
We got more applicants
than we got work.
Really?
Your idea again?
Didn't much care for the labor
bosses I met in New York.
New cemetery runs
from the sawmill
up to the Ridge line.
Ain't a day goes by
we don't put some one or two
in the ground up there,
most from railroad mishaps.
And the others?
Spare time mishaps.
Is that where the fair-haired
maiden of the west is buried?
No, she's buried in
a wild flower field she liked.
- Did you know her?
- A bit.
Well, you must've known her
better than that
if you knew where she wanted
to be buried.
Mrs. Bell should've left
Hell On Wheels
when she had the chance.
This ain't no place for a lady,
less'n she's a whore.
I can assure you,
Mr. Bohannon,
I am neither a lady
nor a whore.
Figured you'd have to be
a little bit of both
being a newspaper woman.
Get outta here.
Huh.
You figured wrong.
You Bohannon?
I am.
Keep your railroad
off my property.
I won't tell you again.
Where'd they come from?
No idea.
Train for Omaha leaves
in an hour.
I expect you won't
wanna miss it.

Eminent Domain
Howdy.
Who are you?
You come pawin' around
for turmoil,
you best think twice, friend.
This is my office.
Mr. Ferguson.
Dick Barlow.
Just arrived from Omaha.
Didn't Mr. Bohannon tell you
to expect me?
No.
What you want in here?
Well, I can tell by looking,
you ain't short a hat size,
so I guess you know.
I'm new Chief
of Railroad Police.
You work for me now.
Coffee?
My grandpap taught me
how to make it.
The trick is not to over-boil.
And, of course, the sock.
Now, uh, I use a clean one.
But pap swore
the riper the sock,
the richer the brew.
I like a dollop of fresh cream
in mine,
but it ain't real regular
I come across it.
And kicking don't get you
nowhere less'n you're a mule.
So mostly,
I just take mine black.
Mr. Bohannon
ain't said nothing
about me working for nobody.
Well, it ain't no good cold now.
Go on.
That's it.
Mm.
That'll get your hair
out of the butter every time.
Don't want no trouble.
- Came to talk.
- What about?
Think you know.
Come ahead.
You survive the war?
- I did.
- You a Johnny Reb?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I was.
So you know a little
about what it's like,
somebody comes,
takes your land.
Everything I had's been took.
Indians killed my father
and my brother,
his wives and kids.
My wives and I,
we buried 'em on the same hill
I pulled our surveyor stakes
out of.
My family bled for this land,
Mr. Bohannon,
carved this place out
of a wilderness nobody wanted.
It is
by Heavenly Father's decree
that we are here,
and it shall be by His will,
not yours, that we leave.
Even God can't stop
the railroad, Mr. Hatch.
It would destroy all we built,
take away our home.
Mm.
You have my word.
You'll get a square deal.
Now, now,
that's the best I can do.
- Could go around.
- Boy.
Ain't nothin' but wilderness
and Lamonites out here, father.
I said that's enough.
You will excuse
my son's manners.
He's got some growing
still to do.
Tell you what.
Um...
Let me see if my surveyors
can't find a way around.
Now, that...
that's not a promise.
Ift can't be done,
you'll still have to move.
But it don't cost nothing
to try.
Well, a journey
through these lands
at this hour is a foolish one,
Mr. Bohannon.
You are welcome to stay
till morning.
Much obliged.
Seen me a Mormon man
killed once.
Liberty, Missouri...
During the war.
As if them white folk didn't
have enough to fight about,
county sheriff run him through
with a sword
on account of him
being a "Palgemist."
Yep, they didn't like them
no "Palgemists"
in Liberty, Missouri.
Like they Mormons
didn't like them no negroes.
Yeah.
They a nasty bunch.
I think
you mean "polygamist."
What'd I say?
"Palgemists."
Well, I knew it was
something like that.
Why a man gotta get
hisself killed
over being a polygamist?
It's the custom
of having more than one wife
at the same time.
More than one wife, you say?
At the same time?
Well, damn.
No wonder they nasty.
Sand, mud, lime.
Soil like that no good
for the grade, boss.
Take a lot of lumber
to build it.
Yeah, rock wall be better,
but that take time
and rock, which we ain't got.
I've surveyed several routes
through here, Mr. Bohannon.
Sand hills stretch at least
a hundred miles to the north.
We'd have to go South
to get around that farm.
- How far?
- 40 mile, maybe more.
schedule by five weeks.
Yes, sir.
I met the new police chief.
You ain't happy,
track runs both ways.
Where's the livestock?
It's complicated.
Tell you
what's complicated, son.
What I mean is
I've been on the job
for two days.
And deciphering these books
is quite the task.
Near as I can tell,
Mr. Durant formed
several companies
to supply livestock
to the railroad.
Now that he's departed,
the contracts
have been canceled.
Then find some other
damn place, Sean.
Council Bluffs, Denver,
shit, Chicago...
I would, um, but it seems
that Mr. Durant has,
in addition to canceling
our contracts
with his companies,
cornered the market on livestock
in Omaha as well.
Shit!
Should've killed that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.
May I quote you on that,
Mr. Bohannon?
You don't say nothing to her
about railroad business.
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.
- Still here?
- Missed my train.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Oh.
We missed you at services
this morning, Mr. Bohannon.
Was there something
I can help you with?
Thought I'd look in is all.
You gave us a good place...
High, dry ground
upwind of the slaughterhouse.
- Thank you.
- It's good.
It's good for the men, I mean.
And you?
Oh.
Sorry.
Uh...
Railroad has to move a family
of homesteaders off their land.
They're digging in.
And, uh, they're Mormon.
I wonder if you've had
any cause to know
what they might be like
as people.
The Latter Day Saints are not
a legitimate Church of Christ.
They treat their women
as slaves.
They take child brides.
They're a violent people.
They'll fight then, you think?
It has been their way.
Yes.
They got children with 'em.
Then you'll find another way.
By God's Grace.
God's been slack
with the Grace of late.
Then show them yours,
Mr. Bohannon.
What I'm proposing is
a major new commercial hub,
the most important railroad city
in the United States.
And it will be right here
in your backyard.
That is literally my backyard.
You see that pretty confluence
of good sweet-water streams?
Well, it ain't much,
but it's on my land.
My husband left me all of this
when he passed in '62.
Well, it may be
your land now, madam.
But the Union Pacific Railroad
will reach it before the year
is out.
And, through eminent domain,
they will claim it.
That's against the law.
It  the law.
And by law,
the Union Pacific
is compelled to offer you
a fair market price
for your land,
currently $1.50 an acre.
- I'd never sell for that.
- And you won't have to.
Because as a representative
and major stockholder
of Credit Mobilier,
I am prepared
to offer you $100 per acre,
thus waiving eminent domain.
- What's the rub?
- Ah, well...
In order to waive
eminent domain,
we must build
a railroad terminus
and a town on the property,
which we will.
Every pound of beef,
every ton of ore,
every fruit, vegetable,
every bale of hay
from either side
of the Mississippi
must ship through our town.
You will become rich
beyond your wildest dreams.
Weren't you in jail
just a month ago?
- Yes.
- And you're broke,
according to the newspapers.
Flat broke.
Well, how do you expect
to pay us
for our property then?
From construction funds
advanced to me
by the Union Pacific Railroad.
You were kicked off
Union Pacific for stealing.
Union Pacific, Credit Mobilier,
different pockets
to the same pair of pants.
When the judge understood that,
I was released.
You're in Omaha now, New York.
Money won't buy you
judges here.
Opportunity is a powerful
elixir, Mrs. Palmer.
Right.
So you're borrowing money
you don't have
from a company
you don't work for
to buy property
you can't afford
to build a city
that doesn't exist.
Spearheading, as it were.
A new way of doing business
in America.
If all difficulties were known
at the outset of a long journey,
Mr. McGinnis,
few of us would ever
embark at all.
A whiskey for my young friend.
Have you got the money?
I'm very uneasy about this.
If Mr. Bohannon finds out...
You are doing nothing wrong.
You are managing
railroad funds,
and you are managing them well.
Have you got
something else for me?
This is the, uh,
telegraph routing code
for the Union Pacific.
You'll be able to eavesdrop
on all of Mr. Bohannon's
business.
Excellent.
Will you be paying
me today, Mr. Durant?
All in due time,
Mr. McGinnis.
Oh, don't look so glum.
My current situation
is but a temporary setback.
History always sides
with a winner.
Where are you off to so fast?
Excuse me, I'm...
Um...
Uh, stop, no.
Ow, let me go.
Give us a kiss first.
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please, please.
Not like this.
Let's go to my room, huh?
I got us a bottle we can share.
Touch me again,
it'll be your throat!
Bloody whore.
My grandpap,
a dough puncher from way back,
taught me surest way
to a woman's heart
by way of her stomach.
By God, if that wasn't
certain with my Tess.
You married, Mr. Ferguson?
Some could call it that.
Kids?
Got me a new baby girl.
Nothing like a new baby to
make a man count his blessings
and keep them close.
I got five youngsters,
all girls,
if you want to know.
The oldest one's
That little girl of mine,
she beautiful.
I look in her eyes,
and she melt my heart.
But her mama afraid this job
gonna get me killed.
She think that baby ain't gonna
have no daddy to bring her up.
How's the coffee?
It's better the second day.
It's the sock.
Need you boys to ride out
and tell them homesteaders
there's no way around the land.
This here's the writ
of eminent domain.
Let them know the government
pays $1.50 an acre.
Railroad will throw in
another dollar.
Let 'em know that's more
than fair, all right?
Yes, sir.
Oh, you do the talking.
Mormons ain't keen on negroes.
Finish your coffee,
Mr. Ferguson.
I got to visit the necessary.
Then we'll be on our way.
They said
he was a hell-raiser,
but my pap was a lazy son of
a bitch by the time I knew him.
Fact, one time
when I was, oh, nine...
Don't you ever stop talking?
No, sir, I do not.
Out here, a quiet man is twice
as likely as a noisy one
to have his beard clung to
by a bear.
I intend to keep my scalp.
Maybe they're gone.
No, they ain't gone.
Horses still in the barn.
Keep your gun close.
You see our cinch
getting frayed,
start shooting.
Hello!
Anybody home?
Mr. Hatch?
State your business!
I'm Dick Barlow,
Chief of Police,
Union Pacific Railroad.
Think you know why we're here.
I already told the other one,
we ain't leaving.
You ain't got any choice.
That's what
we come to tell you.
We ain't afraid to fight
for what's ours.
You best leave
on out of here now.
Threatening us
ain't gonna get us no...
Barlow!
What
I need 75,000 ties
delivered 25 miles
beyond the end of the rails
before the first of the month,
a hundred barrels
of blasting powder.
Make sure we got enough
wranglers to tend them cattle
when they get here...
from Denver.
Eva!
What happened?
The Mormons shot him.
Shit.
Careful, careful.
I got his legs.
Eva!
Eva, we need you!
Elam, the baby!
You're the closest thing
we got to a doctor.
Go get me some onion broth.
You!
Go to the hotel restaurant,
get me some onion broth now.
Go!
Was it the old man or the boy?
I don't know for certain.
- Certain you don't know.
- Told you I don't know.
Well, I know for certain
there's a man lying here
with a bullet in him.
I just told you
I ain't seen him.
Will you two stop it?
Shut that baby up.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Here.
Prop him up.
Get him up.
Drink the medicine.
Yeah, I can smell the onion
broth through the wound.
He's gut-shot, Elam.
He ain't gonna make it.
Take that damn baby outside.
No, wait.
Bring her here.
Bring her over here.
Please.
Let me see her.
Please let me see her.
Oh.
She's beautiful,
Mr. Ferguson.
Just like you said.
You wanted it.
Not like this.
Well?
All right.
Telegraph the fort.
Tell the major we need help
evicting them homesteaders.
You want a railroad story?
Follow me.
Mr. Hatch!
This is Cullen Bohannon of
the Union Pacific Railroad.
I have a writ of execution here
for the killing of
my Chief of Police.
Come on out.
You don't, and these soldiers
will burn you out.
I won't be able to stop them.
You got one minute,
Mr. Hatch.
United States Cavalry
was not built for waiting.
We didn't come here
to kill women and children.
A disorganized brain
is lacking in moral principles.
Are you aware of that,
Bohannon?
Not something I ponder nights.
Moral principles are
the first line of defense
against criminal behavior.
You learn
something new every day.
Without moral principles,
these Mormons will inevitably
turn to violence
to solve their problems,
just like the heathens.
Am I right about that, chief?
What he talking about?
Y'all keep your barrels down.
You and your boys
put your guns down.
I told you,
stay off my property
or there'll be hell to pay.
And I told you if I couldn't
find a way around,
the U.S. Government would
rightfully claim its land.
You murdered
my Chief of Police.
He was trespassing.
He was warned.
You have to stand accountable.
I am the priesthood holder
of my family, Mr. Bohannon.
Without me,
they will not survive.
You should've thought
about that
before you pulled that trigger.
They won't survive.
I'll see to it they get to
the Mormon settlement
at Fort Smith.
How's that?
- He done it.
- Father?
Did you kill that man, son?
Tell me the truth now.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ferguson,
this boy shoot Dick Barlow?
I ain't sure.
Good God, man, get on with it.
You'd have me hang him?
It's the law, Bohannon.
You said so yourself, and you
are obliged to uphold it.
We do not make exceptions
to the law out here.
You realize he'll hang.
He's just a boy.
You're gonna tell me the truth.
I told you the truth!
Son, you got a different story,
you best tell me right now.
He's just a boy.
Not today he ain't.
All right.
Father.
Come here.
- Father!
- Come on, boy.
- Come on.
- Easy.
Father!
Father!
Sorry, son.
"Life on the prairie is
not worth the powder it takes
to blow it all to hell."
So say the denizens
of Hell On Wheels,
the rollicking tent city
that moves with
the transcontinental railroad
as it creeps across the country
at a pace of two miles per day.
It is no place
for women or children,
as the men who labor here,
veterans of the recent conflict,
immigrants,
and free negroes,
often take to drink
and un-Christian pursuits
when not swinging a hammer
or laying track.
Every man here carries a gun,
which can be had for
as little as $3,
and a knife,
and goes to church on Sunday.
Here you can buy a meal for 35¢
a beer for less than a quarter,
a suit of clothes for $5
that includes a hat.
The belongings of the dead
are cheaper than that.
Any last words, son?
I came here to meet the man
who replaced "Doc" Durant
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific Railroad.
I can tell you he is a man
for whom honor is sacred
and virtue impermanent.
In the brave new wilderness
he calls home,
integrity is important
to Cullen Bohannon.
Whether a man of integrity
is what's needed
to build the railroad,
we don't yet know.
The railroad has always
been the business
of the unscrupulous
and corrupt.
You owe me a life
for the one
you took from me today.
I suspect our new Chief
Engineer to be neither.
And for that, dear reader,
we might all
count our blessings...
and say a prayer.
