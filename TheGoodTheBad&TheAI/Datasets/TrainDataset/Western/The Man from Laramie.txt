He was not inclined
to speak his mind
Hah!
Ho! Oh. Oh.
We'll make camp here for the night.
I'd go a couple more
miles before sundown.
- We'll camp here.
- You're the boss.
Come on, Mr. Lockhart. Grub time.
All right. I'll be along.
Standing here thinking about
it won't bring him back.
Nah. But it reminds me of
what I came here to do.
Hate's unbecoming
in a man like you.
On some men it shows.
Aw, come on, Mr. Lockhart,
let's have some coffee.
All right. All right,
I'll be along.
Whoa!
Well, here we are.
MAN: You want something?
I got three wagonloads of
supplies outside from Laramie.
Laramie? How you get through?
I guess we were lucky. Where
do you want them unloaded?
I don't know.
Well, who does? Where's the boss?
- Upstairs.
- Oh.
Anybody home?
Oh, excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.
I'm looking for the owner
of the mercantile.
I'm the owner.
Oh, well. I see. Well,
I have three wagonloads...
- of supplies for you outside...
- Oh, no.
I was hoping those supplies
would never arrive.
Well, I thought you'd be
anxious to get these goods.
They're paid for. You
seem to need 'em.
I was all sold out and hoping I
could stop being a storekeeper.
Well, sorry to disappoint you, ma'am.
Where do you want the supplies unloaded?
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- What? Oh.
Well, it's a long time since
I've had tea with a lady.
It'd be kind of nice.
- Pull up a chair.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart, ma'am.
Mine's Barbara Waggoman.
Do you take sugar?
Mmm, yes, when I can get it.
You know, I've been in rooms like this
before, but not in this part of the country.
My father brought these things
from our home in Connecticut.
Oh. A man of very
fine taste, I'd say.
Father had an appreciation
for fine living.
But he wasted it in this store, emptying
flower barrels and measuring cotton cloth.
I see.
There must be more to life than
emptying barrels of flour.
Yes, I'd say so.
I've wanted to leave Coronado
ever since my father died,
but the stage for Santa Fe stopped
running because of the Apaches.
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you have any trouble getting here?
- No, we came from Laramie.
- Oh, is that your home?
No, ma'am. No, I...
I can't rightly say
any place my home.
But everybody should
have some place to...
to remember and feel
like they belong to.
Well, I... I always feel
I belong where I am.
Must be wonderful
to feel like that.
Oh, is there any place around
town my men and I can find rooms?
- Right over the caf√©.
- Oh. Fine.
Well, I guess I'd better start
unloading those supplies.
We'll unpack them all and get
them into the shelves for you.
- Thanks for the tea, Miss Waggoman.
- You're welcome, Mr. Lockhart.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Sell very many of these repeating rifles?
- No. Too much money.
- Where'd you get this one?
- Indian traded it for supplies.
Mm-hmm. I wonder where an
Indian would get a rifle like this.
He don't say. I don't ask.
Suppose you come out and help
the fellas unload this stuff, huh?
- They tell me you're from Snake River.
- Yeah.
Well, we expect an
honest deal here.
Just had one. I hope
we get another one.
I do too, if the work is right.
- Pass.
- I can't open.
See ya in a minute.
- Good evening, Miss Waggoman.
- Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.
It's a nice evening.
You're the only one in
town I know to talk to.
- Maybe you can help me.
- How can I help you?
Well, I just hate to make that
trip back with three empty wagons.
I sort of thought maybe you could tell me
where I could pick up a load of freight.
- There's some salt lagoons nearby.
- Is that so?
They're awful close to Apache land.
Well, is this salt free
for the taking, you know?
Well, it always has been.
Well, we could harvest it
ourselves then, couldn't we?
Mr. Lockhart, you were lucky to get
this far without Indian trouble.
If I were you, I'd head back to
Laramie while the trail's still clear.
Yeah, guess you're
right about that.
- Good night, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good night, Miss Waggoman.
- Uh, Miss Waggoman?
- Yes?
Uh, that shipment I delivered to
you... Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything was there.
- Uh-huh.
Well, I just wanted to make sure.
- Good night again, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good night.
Good night.
Visitors!
Do we fort up or run?
Ah, just keep diggin' salt.
If they're from town,
they're not Apaches.
Who's running this
bunch of thieves?
These men work for me,
if that's what you mean.
- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart. What's your name?
That's the only introduction
you need, mister.
That's mighty fancy.
What's it mean?
It means we're Barb riders.
That's Barb salt you're stealing.
- I was told this salt's free for the taking.
- It ain't, not to strangers.
Looks like I was told wrong. If
there's any charge, I'll pay for it.
You can't buy your way out of this.
It's only salt the stranger has taken.
It'd be different if it was cattle.
If we don't teach him a lesson now, how
do we know what he'd steal next time?
Any man says I'd rustle
cattle is a liar.
No need for that, Charley. And no
need for your gun either, mister.
Spud, let's see how good
you can use that rope.
Go ahead, Spud!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jerk him down again if he needs it!
- Burn his wagons!
- What...
I think I'll try your new
model gun on your mules.
A man without wagons
don't need mules.
- You're gonna shoot those mules?
- Ha ha! Anybody invite them on Barb land?
Why, you...
-
-
-
-
- Hold it there!
-
- Come here, boys, let's finish the mules.
- Hold it, Dave!
- I don't need any help to finish this.
- Your old man asked you...
- to stay out of trouble.
- I'm in no trouble, he is!
Trespassing and stealing salt!
You burned his wagons and killed
his mules over a load of salt?
- Get out of here!
- Give me that gun!
Now, get back to the ranch!
You're forgetting your place, Vic.
You only work for my father.
That means you work for me too.
I don't want to cross you, Dave. I'm
just telling you for your own good.
Now, take the boys and
get back to the ranch!
Say please.
Please.
You turn up around here again, you
won't need mules to carry away!
All right, let's go!
Come on!
- I want to thank you, mister.
- This your gun?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about this.
I figure you've kind of had your
belly full of these parts...
and be anxious to get out of here.
No, I figure this place owes me
something, and I'm gonna make it pay.
Let me straighten you out, mister.
We got enough trouble around here
with the Apaches and young Dave.
Now, don't you go startin' any.
Well, that's what I owe you, boys, with a
little extra, to get you back to Laramie.
Good luck to you.
- Thank you.
- Good seein' you, Lockhart.
- So long.
- So long.
Well it looks like the end of our
freight line, doesn't it, Charley?
- Here you are.
- How about you, Mr. Lockhart?
You headin' back to Fort Laramie?
-  Laramie?
- Ain't that where you come from?
I come from Laramie. I didn't
say anything about a fort.
I figured you were an army man.
No, I'm headin' back to town.
I like workin' for you, Mr. Lockhart.
I sort of hate to leave you.
Well, maybe this won't be
the kind of work you like.
If it's got anything to
do with who's selling...
repeating rifles to the
Apaches, I'd like to help.
I've got a personal stake in finding
this man, Charley. What's yours?
I've always been a nosy man.
While you're going into town, maybe I'll
head up north and poke my big nose around.
Up north? That's
Apache land up there.
In my case, that's not so
dangerous. My mother was one.
I've got a lot of
relatives up there.
I might pick up a
little information.
What are you sticking your
neck out for, Charley?
I'm a lonely man,
Mr. Lockhart. So are you.
I don't suppose we spoke ten
words coming down here.
But I feel that I know you,
and I like what I know.
All right, Charley.
All right. Come on, I'll
help you up on that mule.
Sure.
There we go.
- See ya.
- Seeing ya.
- Why, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good evening.
Thought you'd gone back to Laramie.
Well, I had a little mix-up with
some gentlemen from the Barb Ranch.
- They accused me of trespassing.
- Trespassing?
Just who does own those
salt lagoons, anyway?
I suppose they are
part of the Barb,
but nobody's ever made
a point of it before.
Uh-huh. Well, they sure made
a point of it this afternoon.
They burned my wagons
and shot my mules.
They seemed to know exactly
where to find me too.
There's no reason you should
blame me for what happened.
I warned you about the lagoons.
You warned me about the Apache.
You didn't mention the Barb.
The fellow that seemed to cause
most of the trouble was named Dave.
- Do you happen to know him?
- He's my cousin.
Your cousin?
- Oh. Some cousin.
- You don't choose your relatives.
This is the most unfriendly country I've
ever been in. Why is everybody so touchy?
It's a one-man country, and
Alec Waggoman's the man.
Well, I think I've got
to meet that man.
If you stay, you will.
Well, I'm figurin' on
staying around for a while.
- Something bothering you, Mr. Lockhart?
- Yes, a lot of things.
Can I help you?
Well, you have.
Why, just standing here looking
at you makes me feel easier.
You're a bachelor, aren't
you, Mr. Lockhart?
How'd you know that?
Only a lonely man could
find pleasure...
watching a woman unpack
bolts of cotton.
Well, it's not so much what you're doing,
it's just you're mighty nice to look at.
I'm not even pretty.
Oh, I suppose I've seen prettier
girls in dance halls, but...
you're sort of...
beautiful, I'd say.
Well, that's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.
And a stranger had to come all
the way from Laramie to say it.
Well, I wish that was my only
reason for being in Coronado.
- Well, good night, Miss Waggoman.
- Good night, Mr. Lockhart.
Dave!
Aaah!
Aaah!
I told you not to start anything.
Let it alone, Davey boy,
or I'll clip off a thumb!
Hold it, Vic!
I'm Alec Waggoman of the Barb.
- What's the reason for this?
- Ask your son!
- I'm asking you.
- All right, go out to the salt lagoons.
You'll find twelve dead mules and three
burned wagons. They belonged to me.
- Nobody asked you to come here.
- Well, I'm here, Mr. Waggoman.
I'm gonna stay here, and this
town better get used to the idea.
- Who are you?
- Oh, no one you ever heard of.
- Well, what do you want in this town?
- That's the big question, huh?
- You don't ask it very friendly.
- I don't have to.
I own this town. I own as far as you can
ride in any direction for three days.
Yeah, so I hear. Apache land's just
less than one day's ride from here.
- You own that too?
- I have no quarrel with the Apache.
It's dirt farmers and fence raisers
I'm keeping out. Now, which are you?
- Neither!
- Then what are you?
I come from Laramie.
Well, you better keep
travelin', stranger.
You stop in at the Barb in the morning
and I'll pay you for what you lost.
I see you've already
collected interest.
Vic, get Dave and the boys back to
the ranch without any more trouble.
And any of you who can't go
peacefully is fired. Come on.
Dave got just what you should have
given him a long time ago, Alec!
Ma'am, I'd like to thank you
for what you did over there.
Why do you think I did it?
Well, I'd say you have
a fair sense of justice.
This is the only sense of justice
folks respect around here.
Hop in and ride out to my
ranch with me, mister.
Well, I appreciate the hospitality, ma'am.
I have some rooms in the hotel.
Oh, don't argue. I want
to talk to you. Get in.
We'll pick up your horse.
- This isn't exactly a horse
I've got here, you know.
-
- Mr. Lockhart?
- Yeah?
I don't think you oughta go
with that Canaday woman.
- Is that so?
- The Waggomans won't like it.
I kinda figured they wouldn't.
All right. Come on.
Why did you fight Lockhart?
It wasn't your quarrel, Vic.
Alec was watching. I had
to stand up for Dave.
You act like Alec was your own
father instead of your boss.
He's using you just
like he used my father.
When he no longer needs you, he'll
drop you like an ordinary cowhand.
Alec wouldn't do that to me.
He knows if Dave were on his
own, the Barb would fall apart.
Does Dave know that?
Alec won't be around forever.
Then where will you be?
Alec and me talked that over.
When his time comes, he's leaving
the Barb to Dave and me.
That's the same promise
he made my father.
If he broke his word with his own brother,
what can you, a stranger, expect?
Your father was an
easy man. I'm not.
No one's breaking his word with me.
This is no place for us, Vic. I want to
leave, and I want you to leave with me.
Where can we go?
- Anywhere.
- That's the same as nowhere.
Look, Barbara, we've been
all over this before.
Here in Coronado we got something.
Anywhere else we go, we're...
we're just a couple of nobodies.
You keep saying we've got
nothing if we leave.
If we have each other,
doesn't that mean anything?
I love you, Barbara. You know that.
But I worked my whole
life for the Barb.
I got years of sweat and
blood soaked in that ground,
and I'm not giving up
what's rightfully mine.
I know my uncle and
I know my cousin,
and neither one of them will give up
a foot of ground without a fight.
I don't want to see you hurt, Vic.
You're the only one that
can hurt me, Barbara.
I want to be your wife, Vic, but if
I can't get you to leave with me,
I'm not gonna stay around
to become your widow.
I don't die so quick.
Well, Lockhart, what do you
think of the Half Moon?
- What am I supposed to think?
-
It'll go a lot smoother
when you take over.
I'm hiring you to be
the new foreman.
Oh, well, sounds fine, ma'am,
but I'm not looking for a job.
Now, you've made
enemies of the Barb.
You can't stay around here and
stand up to them all on your own.
Barb been giving you
trouble, too, huh?
Trouble?
Twenty-eight years I've been
battling Alec Waggoman,
to keep him from swallowing up the
Half Moon the way he swallowed up...
every other decent piece of
grazing land in the neighborhood.
But I'm gettin' to the point
where I need some help.
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Canaday,
but I'm... I'm not the man for you.
You ain't afraid of the Barb.
You proved that this afternoon.
No, but I've got no quarrel
with the Waggomans now.
They agreed to pay me for
my mules, my wagons...
Just gonna take the money
and let 'em run you out?
No, but I wouldn't be any
good for you, ma'am.
- I'm no cowhand.
- Well, you're no mule skinner either.
I can tell that from the
look of your hands.
Just what  you
doin' here, Lockhart?
Well, you might say on account of some
good wagons of mine that got burned,
or you might blame it on a rope
that dragged me through a fire.
But you'd be closer if you
asked me about my brother.
He was just a kid. We...
I can't realize yet he's dead.
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.
No, I've thought about it too much to
talk. I'm gonna do something about it.
So you're here to hunt
a man and kill him.
I was wonderin' if... Could you let
me have one of your saddle ponies?
I'll pay you for it as soon as
I settle with the Waggomans.
Guess I can fix you up.
We'll go down to the corral...
after we have a bite of supper.
- Maybe you'll reconsider.
- No, the supper sounds fine.
Oh. Do we fight or talk?
We gotta finish that fight someday.
I don't know whether I won or lost.
- Well, we'll call it a draw?
- I'll settle for that.
Come on in. The old
man's expecting you.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
Wagons like yours cost about $75
a piece. Good mule costs 20.
That means the Barb owes you
around $600. I'll make it six.
That's a little more
than I paid for 'em.
- Well, I'm satisfied if you are.
- I'm satisfied.
Sit down.
You worry me, Lockhart, and I'm not easily
worried. What do you want from me?
Well, if you've got nothing to hide,
you've got nothing to worry about.
This is new country, hard country.
I've had to make some hard decisions, but
I've never done anything I was ashamed of.
You don't seem to have much
trouble with the Apache, do you?
I respect 'em. They
were here first.
Whatever I got from 'em I
bought. I didn't just take it.
About six months ago they massacred
a cavalry patrol on your land.
What'd you do about that?
Nothing. They have a right to hunt all
over my land. That was part of our deal.
They shot down 12 men on a routine
patrol. Was that part of the deal too?
I don't know who fired
the first shot. Do you?
I know the United States Cavalry.
What's all this got to do
between you and me?
Everything.
I want to be friends
with you, Lockhart.
- I don't  to be.
- Why?
Well, I'd like you to work for me.
Ah, we don't speak
the same language.
Well, maybe we could
both bend a little.
I've never owned an acre
of land. Never wanted to.
You couldn't live with an acre less than
you've got. Now, just where do we bend?
I'm not trying to buy your
friendship, Lockhart.
I'm just looking for a way to
reach it. Now, how do I do that?
Why am I so important to you?
I don't know you, you don't know me.
I don't know you, but I
knew you were coming.
- What?
- I was expecting you.
Well, I'm afraid you'll
have to explain that.
Nah, you wouldn't understand.
I'll get you your money.
Oh, Vic, come in here.
- Yes, Mr. Waggoman?
- Get me $600.
Cash is all in the safe.
You put it there yourself.
I forgot that. I'll get it.
Well, it's quite an
outfit you've got here.
Biggest in the territory. Be
bigger yet one of these days.
LOCKHART: Doesn't seem like
there's much spreading room left.
VIC:
Oh, there's always room, Lockhart.
A ranch that stops growing
might just as well be dead.
LOCKHART: Some places
get so big they just bust.
Here we are.
Fifty, 100, 150...
Hey, you better watch what you're doing,
Mr. Waggoman. Those aren't fifties...
- ...they're hundreds.
- Oh. Here.
- Give him $600.
- Yeah, sure.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Well, we're all settled up.
- Not quite.
There's nothing to keep
you here now, is there?
That a reason for me to leave?
I know my son's never been whipped
before. He's not gonna like it.
Well, nobody likes being whipped.
Most men get over it.
Look, Lockhart, this is a big country.
There are plenty of towns around.
Now, why don't you be a good fella and
pick some other place to roost, huh?
Hmm. I'll think it over.
That $600 comes out
of your pay, Vic.
pay? What are you talking about?
It was Dave who burned
them wagons, not me.
You should have been
there to stop him.
I've got thousands of head of cattle to
look over. I can't be everywhere at once.
You got it all wrong, Alec.
Maybe I've had it all
wrong for a long time.
When Dave's ma died, I figured
the boy needed a tight rein.
And I thought he'd take it better
from you than he would from me.
But what he don't need is someone
to get him into more scrapes.
Alec, I swear to you, I tried
to stop him out at the lagoons.
Next time there's a mix-up like
that, you'd better stop him,
or I'll bust you to a cowhand.
Better yet, I'll fire you.
- What's that?
- You heard.
Say it again.
I said next time Dave gets in a
mess like that, you're fired.
No one's firing me off
this ranch, Alec. No one.
I belong here as much as
you, and more than Dave.
You're wrong again, Vic.
I like you. I've always liked you.
But Dave's my blood. Him I love.
And likin' and lovin' ain't the same.
You made me a promise. I get a
share of this ranch with Dave.
- And I'm holding you to it!
- You got nothing in your name,
not even the saddle on
the horse you ride.
How are you gonna hold me
to it if I change my mind?
- How?
- You wanna find out, Alec?
Fire me. Go ahead, fire me.
Looking at you, I see
myself 20 years ago.
I don't want to fight
you, boy. I need you.
But you need me too. Now, let's
both try and remember that.
Alec, you oughtn't to push me.
I don't like to be pushed.
I'd push you right off the earth
if I thought it'd help Dave.
You're right, he is weak. All the
more reason he needs your help.
Now, keep both eyes on him, Vic. Do
this for me and I'll be beholden to you.
All right, Alec.
But don't ever push me again.
Hi, Charley.
Well, you didn't spend very much
time up in Apache land, did you?
My mother's relatives wasn't
anxious for me to stay on.
When I was a boy, my pa told me...
that I was lucky to have an
Irish pa and an Indian ma.
Said I'd have two
places to come home to.
Don't seem like I have any.
Well, about the only home I
remember is an army barracks.
Give me a little of that, will ya?
I guess we're just
not the homey type.
Why don't you go back
to Laramie, Captain?
- What do you mean, "Captain"?
- You talk like one.
I used to be a scout
in the Cavalry.
Got so I could fix a man's
rank by the tone of his voice.
- Why are you tryin' to get rid of me?
- 'Cause there's trouble comin',
and you can't handle
it by yourself.
Well, suppose you just tell
me what you found out.
Sure.
If you're lookin' for the repeatin'
rifles, you've come to the right place.
Some of the young bucks are
sportin' 'em. They expect a lot more.
- Couple of hundred more.
- When? Who from?
I didn't press the point.
If I'd gotten too nosy, I wouldn't
have been able to ride out.
But they got a contact.
Somebody's supplyin' 'em.
There wasn't any guns in that
load of freight we hauled.
Won't be any more
wagons in for a month.
Wonder where that
shipment's coming from.
All I know is they're excited, like
they're expecting them guns soon,
in a couple of days at most.
- What makes you think that?
- Because they already paid for them.
And nobody takes pay from the
Apaches without deliverin'.
Those guns might be here already.
Sounds more like it.
Yeah, but where?
They'd be pretty hard to hide.
- You expecting to meet someone?
- No.
Somebody's following you,
but he's keeping out of sight.
Yeah. I thought I saw
the sun reflecting...
against a gun or a pair
of spurs or something.
- Better let me ride with you.
- No, you go back into town.
- I'll see you later.
- Whatever you say, Captain.
Hold it, mister!
- All right, speak your piece.
- Wasn't doing nothing.
You've been followin' me
ever since I left the Barb.
But I didn't mean no
harm. I ain't got a gun.
Come on, come on, this hot sun makes
a fella impatient. Hurry up. Come on.
I'm... I'm... I'm just trying
to make an honest dollar.
See, not holding down a steady job,
why, I got lots of time to pick up
bits of news here and there, you know?
And... well, I guess I know everything
private that goes on in Coronado.
- What's that got to do with me?
- Well, you...
you strike me as a man that's
lookin' for somethin'...
and willing to pay for it.
Uh-huh. Well, that depends on what
the information is, who's selling it.
Well, I ain't got no references,
but anybody can tell you...
that Chris Boldt is a
man not to be trusted.
That means nobody's secrets
are sacred with me.
Uh-huh. Just who you
figurin' on sellin' out?
You just name 'em.
It wouldn't be me, would it?
Come on, who put you on my trail?
Who are you working for, Boldt?
- Myself.
- You're lyin'. Come on, try again.
Well, I can see we ain't gonna
do no business, Mr. Lockhart,
so if you'll just lower that
gun, I'll get on my way.
Go on, go on. Go ahead. Hey!
Don't you ever come up
ridin' behind me again, huh?
- Lockhart?
- Yeah?
I'm Sheriff Tom Quigby.
Oh, pleased to make your
acquaintance, Sheriff.
I handle the law here in Coronado.
I like things peaceful.
Seems peaceful to me.
It sure ain't, mister. Not
since you breezed in.
I heard about your fight
with Dave Waggoman.
You know, Dave's the kind of
a lad that'll hold a grudge.
You two meet up again, and
likely as not there'll be a killin'.
Uh-huh. Well, that's up to Dave.
It's up to me to see
that it don't happen.
So I'm suggesting
that you leave town.
Well, why don't you
take it up with Dave?
It was him that started
it at the salt flat.
Or do you take orders
from the Barb?
Wait, I don't take any
orders from anyone.
Yeah. If you'll excuse me,
I want to bed down my horse.
- Thanks for the knife.
- Anytime.
It's your neck, Lockhart. If
you want a Christian funeral,
better leave some money
with the undertaker.
-
-
Good evening, Miss Waggoman.
Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.
- Padre, this is Mr. Lockhart.
- Padre.
Well, is this a
private celebration?
No. Everyone
is welcome at a wedding.
He brought the supplies
in from Laramie.
Oh. It's a good thing you got here.
I was running out of candles.
Well, these Pueblos are a lot different
from the Apache, aren't they?
The Pueblos were cliff dwellers. They
have lived in peace for centuries.
The Apaches are hunters and warriors.
They have never been anything else.
Speaking of the Apache, do you
happen to know anything...
about the massacre of a cavalry patrol
at Dutch Creek several months ago?
Only what I heard... That it was an
unprovoked and ruthless killing.
Did you know that the Apache
used repeating rifles?
There was some talk about that.
Was there any talk about
where the rifles came from?
Some men will sell
anything for a profit.
Uh-huh. I suppose there's a man
like that in every town, huh?
- Padre.
- Excuse me.
I heard my uncle paid you
for your mules and wagons.
That he did. He did.
Then I guess you'll
be leaving soon.
No, I think I'll stick
around for a while.
Maybe you could invite
me up to tea again, huh?
- Still around, huh, Lockhart?
- Mm-hmm.
- You getting used to the idea?
- Looks like I'll have to.
I'm sorry I'm late, Barbara.
The old man kept me.
Mr. Lockhart was
filling in for you.
Never thought you'd find anything like
this in Coronado, did you, Lockhart?
Nor anyplace else.
Victor, I hope you're not going
to be late for your own wedding.
I'm ready right now, Padre.
Even got my wedding suit on.
- Think Alec will give you a night off?
-
Well, I better be moving
along. Good night, all.
Good night.
- I'll trouble you for your gun, Lockhart.
- Huh?
Hand it over.
- What'd I do now?
- You just can't let a day go by...
without pickin' a fight, can ya?
- Who's complainin' now, Sheriff?
- Ever hear of a Chris Boldt?
- Yeah, I've heard of him.
- When did you see him last?
About a half hour ago. He came out
of an alley, pulled a knife on me.
He was there. He saw him.
I didn't see.
- What's the charge, Sheriff?
- Supposin' you tell me what happened.
I just told you what happened.
The fella pulled a knife on me,
we wrestled around for a little
bit and he ran down the alley.
- That's what happened.
- That's not all, Lockhart.
- Chris Boldt is dead.
- He...
What? I found him at
the end of the alley.
He was knifed to death.
Let's go.
I want to see him alone, inside.
- How'd you get in this mess?
- I thought maybe you were behind it.
Should the time come I want to get rid
of you, I won't use any half measures.
You told me you owned the whole
town. Does that include the sheriff?
Quigby's an honest man.
- I never interfere with him.
- I see, I see.
You'll need a lawyer, you'll need a
friendly judge. I've got 'em both.
- I'll try and get you out.
- Why are you doing all this?
I want you out of Coronado.
Suppose you tell me the real
reason why you're here.
- Well, that's not easy.
- What?
Do you dream much, Lockhart?
- No, no.
- You're a lucky man.
For years now, ever
since Dave's ma died,
I've had the same dream two
or three nights a week.
It's always the same.
A stranger comes into my home.
He's tall, lean, like yourself.
Has a voice like yours.
Even walks like you.
Well, I don't know
anything about dreams.
He comes with a gun in his hand.
- He comes to kill my boy.
- What?
My Dave.
I know it's only a dream,
but I'd rest much easier if you
hadn't have come to Coronado.
Yeah, well, I'd rest much
easier too if I hadn't.
Well, then, take my
offer and go away.
I appreciate the offer, but I
can't accept the conditions.
Why not?
You're not gonna find the answer to
your dream around here, Mr. Waggoman.
You better look someplace else.
Tom.
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Kate.
- Alec?
- What is it, Kate?
Oh, I just thought that sometime we'd have
more to say to each other than just hello.
- What else is there to say?
-
Nothing, I guess.
- Why did you do it, Lockhart?
- Oh, you, too, huh?
Now, look here. You get into a scrap with a
man, and five minutes later he's found dead.
- What am I supposed to think?
- You're supposed to think I killed him.
I came all the way from Laramie to creep
up a dark alley and knife the town drunk.
- Now, does that make better sense to you?
- If it did, I wouldn't be here.
- Well, can you get me out of this place?
- That's what I came for.
I got the circuit judge
to give me a writ.
You're released in my custody
till the trial comes up.
Well, that's the best offer I've had
today. You're a very fine woman.
No, I'm not. The Half Moon needs
a foreman who the Barb respects.
You're the only man around
here who fills that bill.
I told you I didn't know anything about
cattle. I wouldn't do you any good.
But you've got cause to
hate the Barb. That'll do me.
I've got grief enough of my own without
taking on yours. No, thank you.
Now, look here, Mr. Lockhart. I'll give
you one minute to make up your mind.
Either you'll take my offer, or I'll tear up
this writ and you can rot here in this jail.
You're just a hard, scheming,
old woman, aren't you?
Ugly too. Tom, let this
rooster out of here.
You know, these beef tallies
still don't come out right.
Here, you add 'em up.
I'm not good at paperwork,
Pa. You know that.
Well, no cowman is,
but it's gotta be done.
Davey boy, you can't hold onto 100,000
acres by riding horse in a buckskin jacket.
You've got to develop
a head for figures.
Sure, Pa. Sure.
You're not even
listening to me, Son.
Oh, sure, I'm listening to you,
Pa. I always listen to you.
Bring your chair over here.
Come on. Right here. Sit down.
You know, Davey, you're
just like your mother.
She'd always listen, but
she never understood.
I'm gonna try, Pa. I'm gonna try to
be like you want me from now on.
You know it hurts
me to ride you son.
And if I do, it's only
because I love you.
I want to protect you, and
I want to be proud of you.
I just want to be able to stand
on my own feet. Vic won't let me.
Now, don't blame Vic. He's
only carrying out my orders.
You still need him, boy. Now,
believe me when I tell you that.
I know you mean well, Pa, but...
Well, it don't look good. Vic giving
the orders when I should be the one.
You will soon, Son. You will soon.
Just bide your time.
You see...
Half Moon hired that
Lockhart fella.
- I thought he was in jail.
- Kate got him out on a writ.
You might've expected that.
Stranger comes to town, and you boys fix
it so he gets a grudge against the Barb.
Kate's not gonna miss an
opportunity like that.
- Come on, Vic.
- Where do you think you're goin'?
Kate hired herself a gun.
That's plain enough.
Dave's right, you let her get
away with this, she'll hire more.
Nobody asked you. Keep away
from the Half Moon, both of you.
I've never seen you run away from a
fight before. What's got into you?
Times have changed. In the old days,
I used to crack down plenty. I had to.
There wasn't much law then.
But it was the only way I could
build the Barb and hold it.
And now you've gone soft, huh?
You'll be taking over the
ranch pretty soon, Dave.
Maybe sooner than you think.
You'll need peace and friends.
What do you expect me to do?
Run the Barb with a pencil?
I'm not afraid to try
anything you did!
I hate to tell you this, but
you're not the man I was.
Copy me and you'll meet up
with somebody who'll break ya.
So stop acting like a crazy
colt and get ahold of yourself,
or you won't get a chance
to run this outfit at all!
I didn't spend a lifetime building this
thing up for you to fritter it away.
Now go over those beef
tallies like I told you to!
I want to see you, Vic.
Come here, Vic.
Look out there. Tell
me what you see.
Same old mountains.
Uh, any snow on 'em yet?
What's the matter, Alec?
I'm going blind, that's
what's the matter.
I own 100,000 acres, and I can't
see more than ten of them.
- Have you seen a doctor?
- The best.
That trip I made to Chicago
wasn't to sell beef.
I went to see a specialist. He says I came
too late. There's nothing can be done.
Six months to a year from now I
won't even be able to shave myself.
- Did you tell Dave?
- No, not yet.
I'm telling you first because
I expect more from you.
When they know the
old man can't see,
the wolves will close in on this
place and tear it to pieces.
Don't you worry, Alec. Anybody
that crosses our boundaries...
will grab only enough
land to bury himself in.
Oh, I know you can fight, Vic,
but that's not enough alone.
You've got to think.
Even if you can't see, you can
still do the thinkin' for us, Alec.
I've been pretty hard on you, Vic.
Maybe harder than you deserve.
Maybe I've been jealous,
because you're not my son too.
Take care of my boy.
Love him like a brother,
and I'll love you like a son.
All right, Pa.
Take the east trail up
into the high country.
You'll find some of my cattle
mixed in with the Barb herd.
If we don't cut 'em out they'll
end up wearing the Barb brand.
Uh-huh. All right, boss.
I'll ride up and have a look.
And, uh, Lockhart?
Keep your eye on the cattle. Don't
knife any more town drunks.
Yes, ma'am.
Gimme the glass.
It's Half Moon stock. Come
on, boys. Let's corral 'em.
Now, Dave. Alec said let
things sit for a while.
They're grazing on Barb
land, aren't they?
So they're eating a mouthful of grass.
We got plenty growin' around here.
Alec always said, "A steer swallows a blade
of Barb grass, it becomes a Barb steer."
Are you tryin' to change that, Vic?
No, Dave. I'm just tryin'
to follow Alec's orders.
I heard you talkin' to him in the parlor.
I heard every word you said.
All you're tryin' to do is to make me
look weak to make yourself look strong.
You got the old man believin'
you're a plaster saint.
I'm gonna show the cracks in you.
You all finished, Dave?
I'm finished talkin',
but I'm not finished.
Until Alec changes things,
I'm tellin' the boys what to do.
I'm tellin' 'em, Dave, not you.
Go on. Tell them. You're not gonna
give 'em the orders much longer.
It won't take all of us to corral a few
head of steers. Ned and I can handle 'em.
You and the rest of the boys
can take care of our stock.
Come on, Ned.
Hold it here, men.
- What are you doin' on Barb land?
- I'm checking Half Moon stock.
You got Dave in the hand. Now
there's gonna be the devil to pay.
Take his gun from him.
Gimme his gun. Give it to me!
- Now grab his arm.
- You ain't gonna kill him, Dave!
- DAVE: Do like I tell ya!
-
Look at it, Lockhart.
Look at it!
-
-
Why, you scum!
Shove him off our land.
I'm gonna ride to town.
Hold it, Lockhart.
Get his horse.
Hah.
Have you gone crazy? Put out that
fire before the Apache see it.
I want the to Apache to see it.
I want 'em to come and get their guns.
Get away from that fire, Vic.
There's 200 repeatin'
rifles in that wagon.
If the Apache lays their hands on 'em,
they'll massacre the whole territory.
By tomorrow morning there'll be nothing
left of the Half Moon but smoke and ashes.
You don't know the Apache, Dave.
You can't make a deal with them to raid
the Half Moon and leave the Barb alone.
Once they get those guns and start
killin', there's no stoppin' 'em!
I don't care! Kate hired herself a gun
fighter. I'm hiring myself some Indians.
Look at my hand. Look at it!
It hurts. It hurts bad.
He did it, and he's
going to get his.
Now, get back away
from the fire, Vic.
Listen, Dave. So far no knows we've
sold a few guns to the Apache.
But turn loose 200 of
these repeatin' rifles,
you're gonna start a
full-scale Indian war!
I can handle it so they
won't dare attack us.
- There's women and kids in Coronado!
- They're not mine!
What about your father?
Supposin' he finds out about this.
- Who's gonna tell him? You?
- Yes!
Now, put out that
fire or I'll tell him.
That's the last order you're giving me, Mr.
Hansbro. You or the old man or anybody.
You're all against me! You've
always been against me.
Who is this Lockhart?
How do I know you didn't bring him in here
to gun me? I can't trust nobody no more.
I'm gonna fix things my way.
I'm gonna bring in the Apache.
I'm gonna give 'em the guns.
I'm gonna get even with everybody. I'll
show you who's weak and who's strong!
- You're crazy!
-
You hand me that towel, Barbara.
Hold his arm steady now, because...
this is gonna hurt.
Have you done this before?
I've patched up bullet holes in
places I wouldn't like to mention.
Just the sort of stunt
Dave Waggoman would pull.
Pity his ma isn't alive.
She'd be real proud if she could
see the way he's turned out.
Don't talk so much, Kate.
Dave Waggoman's ma was a pretty little
piece of fluff from back East somewhere.
She marched Alec to the altar
before he knew what struck him.
Then when she found out he was
too much of a man for her,
she made certain that his son
didn't turn out to be like him.
Hmm! She petted and she pampered
him till he was spoiled rotten.
You must've known him
before he was married.
I was engaged to him. He stood me
up, that... that uncle of yours.
- You still love him.
- What... After what he did to me?
If he asked you today,
you'd marry him.
Why, sure, but just to get
my hands on the Barb Ranch.
There.
That oughta hold ya.
That's a real professional job. Looks like
it's been done by a good army surgeon.
Oh, you've been treated
by army surgeons?
No, I've seen 'em in action.
I think we could all
stand a pot of coffee.
Let me make it.
No, you take Mr. Lockhart into the parlor
where he'll be a little more comfortable.
Thank you.
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't come here.
My coming had nothing to
do with the trouble here.
The seeds of it were planted long
before I ever heard of Coronado.
I don't mean Coronado. I mean me.
You? What have I done
to you, Miss Waggoman?
I was so sure. Now I don't know.
You don't know about what?
How I feel about everything.
Well, I'm very sorry if I've
upset you, Miss Waggoman.
Stop calling me Miss Waggoman!
Shall I call you Barbara?
- Oh, don't go.
- I mustn't stay.
No, please. Just for a minute.
I feel like something will be
said that shouldn't be said.
You know, you've got orders from Kate
to entertain the patient, you know.
Please.
All right.
Did you know Daniel Boone was 84 years
old when he crossed the Rockies?
Oh, yes. Everybody knows that.
I know all about Daniel Boone...
how many children he had, the
towns that were named after him.
- Is that so?
- Ask me. Just ask me.
KATE: Coffee's ready.
Shall I serve it in here?
I'd best be getting home
before it gets dark.
Well!
What did you say to her?
I declare, I can't understand
that Waggoman family.
- Barbara's the nice one.
- She sure is.
Well, we'll have a cup of coffee.
Don't touch him.
- Who did it?
- It was that Lockhart.
He must've circled around from
the Half Moon and laid for Dave.
- Come on, boys.
- Hold it, Fritz.
Alec's still the boss of the
Barb. He's givin' the orders.
What do we have to wait for?
We know Lockhart did it.
How do ya know? Did
you see him do it?
- Who else could it be?
- That's for Alec to decide.
Now, get back to the
bunkhouse, all of ya!
There now.
I don't know what I would've
done without you, Miss Canaday..
I'll fix us some breakfast.
Bacon and eggs do?
- Yeah. Fry 'em hard.
- Army style, huh?
Yeah. Well, the army's a pretty good place
for a fella that's alone. I kinda miss it.
- Why did you ever leave it then?
-
I'll get it.
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Morning. Morning, Kate.
Come on in, Tom.
What's the trouble?
Dave Waggoman's dead.
How'd it happen?
That's why I'm here... to try and find
out. I heard what Dave did to you.
Maybe you had good cause.
I don't know. But killin' is killin'.
I didn't kill him, Sheriff. He headed
for town. I came right here.
His own men will tell you that.
You could've doubled back,
met him along the trail.
- I didn't kill him.
- I don't believe you did...
but the men at the Barb think
different. I just came from there.
Vic's tryin' to hold 'em down. How
long he can do it, I don't know.
How's Alec takin' it?
He just sits there in the
parlor, staring at Dave's body.
When the old man comes
out of his shock,
I wouldn't give a plugged
nickel for your life.
Well, I'm not runnin' away
from somethin' I didn't do.
I rode all the way out here just to
warn ya. I guess the rest is up to you.
All right. You tell Alec Waggoman I'll
be right here if he wants to see me.
KATE:
I feel real sorry about Dave, Alec.
- I'm goin' with you, Alec.
- It was my son he killed.
- You're no match for Lockhart.
- I've gotta do this thing alone.
I don't want anybody followin' me.
Now, stay in town, all of ya.
-
- Hold it, Waggoman!
- That you, Lockhart?
- I'm right here!
- Hah!
-
You think I killed your boy?
Go ahead. Even the score.
You came here to kill, didn't you?
There's just one man I have reason
to kill, and I haven't found him yet.
Take your gun. You'll need
it the next time I see ya.
You've got to believe
me. I didn't do it.
I'm not the man in your
dream, Mr. Waggoman.
Sit down, Vic.
You shouldn't be doin' book
work with your eyes, Alec.
Sit down.
I just finished going over
bills for the past six months.
I found where we ordered a wagonload
of fence wire from New Orleans.
Since when do we use fence wire?
We paid for a wagonload we didn't get.
That's too much money for fence wire.
Too much. There was somethin'
else in that wagon.
You askin' or tellin' me, Alec?
I just want the truth. You don't
have to defend Dave any longer.
I just want to know.
Wagonload of supplies
is quite an item.
Why didn't you ever
tell me it was missing?
How could I? What could I say?
"Your son is a thief"?
We're alone in this room, Vic. We
don't have to hide our feelings.
If you think Dave was selling guns
to the Apache, I want to know it.
Dave was wild, yes, but he
wouldn't do a thing like that.
No, no. Not that.
Well, say somethin'!
Well, if you want me to agree
with you, I'll agree with you.
I've gotta know for sure.
Now, this I've got to know.
- We're gonna find that wagon.
- Forget about it.
How can I? All I've got left to
hang onto are a few memories.
If Dave was selling guns to the
Apaches, I don't even have that.
Nobody said there were guns in that
wagon! Stop thinkin' there were!
I can't live with a lie! I've got
to know one way or the other.
There's not so many places they
can hide a wagon in this country.
We'll find it.
Now, supposin' we find that wagon.
Supposin' there are guns in it.
Will that make you feel any better?
Yes. 'Cause then I'll know the
man I buried was not my son,
just a stranger.
Well, looks like you've been
sittin' there for two weeks.
Yeah. I just ate a pound of
dust with this can of beans.
Hear you got yourself in
a real box this time.
Yeah. Someone sure is doin'
a fine job of messin' me up.
- Did you decide to go back to Laramie?
- Still tryin' to get rid of me?
No, sir. This is just one
more reason for me stayin'.
- Found some wagon tracks.
- Where?
Right along this break here,
due south of them mountains.
A peculiar thing, though.
Only found one single track.
One and only one wagon got through.
Where were they headed?
Into Apache land?
Didn't seem like they
were headin' nowhere.
I lost the trail right at the
foot of them mountains.
Yeah. Let's see if
we can pick it up.
Well, you couldn't hide a stray dog down
there, let alone a wagon, even from my eyes.
- Must be up above somewhere.
- How could a wagon get up there?
There'd have to be a trail and
it'd have to be plenty wide.
I know every foot of these
rocks. We'll find it.
Let's go back, Alec. We're
not doin' any good here.
Even if the wagon's there, you
know you don't want to find it.
You can go back if you want
to, Vic. I'll find it myself.
Alec!
- Huh?
- Don't go any further.
- What is it you don't want me to find?
- I lied to you.
- I didn't find Dave's body on the trail.
- Why would you lie about that?
Because I found him near the guns
and I didn't want you to find out!
When a man starts lying he can't stop.
What else you hiding? What else?
Alec, I want you to listen to me.
My whole life I worked and
sweat and bled for you.
I was the only son you ever
had, but you couldn't see me.
Half the time you never
even knew I was there!
I loved you like only a boy
who never had a father could.
So I'm asking you once
more, now, don't go!
I'm gonna see what's
on that plateau.
- Listen to me, you old fool!
- Take your hands off me!
- I tell ya, don't go!
- Let go!
That wagon must've been loaded real
heavy. Look how deep those tracks are.
CHARLEY: This is where it ends,
right here in the creek.
Yeah.
All right, Charley, you go downstream
there. I'll go up the draw here.
- How is he?
- Still unconscious.
Don't keep anything from us,
Doctor. We want to know.
Well, Alec's strong. He's got a
fair chance to pull through, but...
Finish what you started to say.
He's blind. Oh, it's no surprise.
Sight had been failing for years.
The fall just hurried it up, that's all.
I'm real curious to find
out who pushed him.
- Pushed him?
- You don't think he fell.
With his eyes, he had
no business on a horse.
There's nothing wrong
with his horse's eyesight.
Somebody pushed him, all right. The same
one who killed Dave and Chris Boldt.
Who?
I'm afraid Alec's the only
one who can tell us that.
I have another call to make.
Sit with him until I get back.
- You already know who it is, don't you?
- What makes you say that?
If you do, I want you to tell me.
If I knew I wouldn't be
waiting for Alec to come to.
- What are you afraid of?
- Why should I be afraid?
I don't know.
I don't know, but you are.
I knew it would come
to this. It just had to.
No, it didn't have to.
Somebody made it happen.
When my father was dying,
he told me to leave.
He said everything here was built on greed
and killing, and it would go on that way.
But I wouldn't listen. I saw
only what I wanted to see.
Tell me... Tell me what you're
thinking. I've got to know.
I'm not sure.
I came as soon as I heard.
How did he die?
He's not dead, Vic. Not yet.
- Well, how did it happen?
- We don't know. He's still unconscious.
- Maybe I can get him to tell me.
- Take it easy.
- I've got to see him. I gotta know.
- The doc says his chances are just fair.
He may not wake up at all. You barging
in there won't help things any.
Why don't you pour
yourself a cup of coffee?
I heard he fell.
Alec was too good a horseman
to fall out of a saddle.
Have any idea who'd want
to get rid of the old man?
Alec made a lot of enemies when
he was buildin' up the Barb.
But that was long ago.
- If I could just see him...
- Why don't you just sit down and relax, Vic?
Kate's in there with him.
I can get him to talk, Kate. I know
him better than anybody else.
Lockhart, he's askin' for you.
Who's that? Who is there?
- It's Will Lockhart, Mr. Waggoman.
- Oh, good.
Good. Come over here, Lockhart.
Come here close to me.
Ah, good. Sit down, huh?
I got going over those old bills.
I found out about a
shipment of rifles.
He made Dave do it.
Made Dave sign the order too.
Wouldn't tell me where they were.
But I know every hiding
spot in this country.
He killed Dave.
He tried to kill me too.
Who?
The man in my dream.
He didn't come from far
away to kill my boy.
He was right here in my house...
pretending he loved me like a son.
Vic.
That's the man you're looking for.
Kate. Where are you, Kate?
Kate.
Kate. Where are you, Kate?
Well, here. Here I am, Alec.
- Don't go away, Kate.
- I've never left you, Alec.
Hah!
Hold it, Vic.
Unbuckle your belt.
Turn around.
I came a thousand miles
to kill you, Hansbro.
You're crazy. I never
did anything to you.
I'm not gonna rush it.
- I've waited a long time for this.
- What are you talkin' about?
I never laid eyes on ya till
that day at the salt flats.
You got no cause to shoot me.
- Shootin' is too good for ya.
- What did I do to ya?
Tell me. What did I do?
I got a right to know.
Yeah, I guess a man's got a right
to know what he's gonna die for.
- The Dutch Creek massacre.
- I wasn't there. I never even heard of it.
My brother was there, along with a
whole patrol of kids just like him.
You sold the Apaches
the guns they used.
You're just as guilty as if you
pulled the trigger yourself.
Well, give me a chance.
I'll give you the same
chance you gave Alec.
They're comin' for their guns.
Kill me and they'll kill you.
Get over behind that wagon.
- What're you gonna do?
- Do as I tell ya! Get over there!
Kick that log out from
under that wheel.
Get the wagon moving. Push!
Come on! Push!
Come on!
Come on! Get back here!
They paid for these guns. If they
don't get 'em, they'll kill us.
Come on! Push!
All right, get up at
that front wheel.
Pull up on that wheel.
Come on! Do as I say! Harder!
-
- Harder!
Come on! Harder!
Harder! Harder!
All right. Come on back here.
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
- Feel like such a fool, at my age too.
- Well, you look like a bride.
-
- When's the wedding?
Just as soon as he's
well enough to stand up.
That won't be very long.
He's sittin' up now.
ALEC: Kate. Where are you, Kate?
He needs me.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah.
Barbara! Barbara!
- Bye, Miss Waggoman.
- Bye, Mr. Lockhart.
When you go east you'll pass
through Laramie, and, uh,
if you should ask for
a Captain Lockhart,
well, almost anybody would
tell you where to find me.
I'll remember that.
Oh, he was friendly
to everyone he met
Everyone admired
the fearless stranger
Everyone admired
the fearless stranger
So they never bossed
or double-crossed
