The Comanche and the whites have
been at war since the early 1800s.
The Texas Rangers were formed
as a volunteer troop in order
to contain the Comanche.
Northwest Texas 1858
There's a lot of Indians
down there, Captain Scull.
Well, don't be tempted
by them, Mr. Call.
They're the wrong Indians.
I've never been thwarted
in the pursuit
of a felonious foe, and I don't
intend to be this time.
That's Buffalo Hump
and his band, gentlemen.
And the felonious foe I want
is that horse-stealing
Kicking Wolf.
I wouldn't be foolish enough
to take on Buffalo Hump's whole
camp with just ten men, Captain.
Captain's never been
run off from,
and Kicking Wolf's
never been caught.
Who would you bet against if
you had to wager, Woodrow--
Captain Scull or Kicking Wolf?
I wouldn't bet
against the captain
even if I thought
he was wrong, Gus.
He's the captain.
Hell, I'd bet against
him in a minute.
Hey.
Huh?
It's heading toward night.
Ain't we gonna camp and
brew us up some coffee?
Do you see a campfire?
You see any coffee, sir?
No.
And don't you be "sirin'"
me, you durn yapper.
You two can argue
some other tim
Let's go.
I consider you
a lucky man, Woodrow.
You'll probably be
long married before I am.
You'll never be married,
unless you give up on Clara.
She don't mean
to marry you, and that's that.
Well, if you knew
anything about women,
you'd know they change
their minds ever day.
You would've made a good
Indian, Woodrow.
You got no use
for the settled life.
I got no use
for idle palaver,
if that's what you mean.
I'd rather listen
to a hoot owl hoot
than listen to you
think up insults.
Call is with Big Horse Scull.
And the other one is there.McCrae.
They are chasing Kicking Wolf.
He stole many of their horses.
Call killed your brother.
You kill him.
I gave him to you.
Why are you standing there?
Augustus!
Cut him off!
I'll ride him down, the scamp!
Bible and sword!
Aha.
That's him, gentlemen.
That's Buffalo Hump.
Bible and sword.
It's not every day you get to
Bualo Hu at breakfas
???
NThat young cub we were chasing
u'd nt is talking to him.
I expect it's his son,
Blue Duck.
He has a Mexican look about him.
Probably a child of a captive.
He just looked right at me.
Let me look.
He almost got me once,
the devil.
He's older, but he
ain't dead, Woodrow.
SCULL:
Those torturing fiends
down there are theest,
most capable
opponents
I've ever faced.
And I mean
to kill them
to the last man.
But when it's done, mm...
by God, I'll miss them.
You'll miss them, sir?
I'm a fighting man, Mr. McCrae.
And fighting men need other
fighting men to fight.
Well, we're
a tempting morsel,
sitting up here
on top of this hole.
We better make ourselves
morsels in motion then.
Why, Miss Tilton,
so good to see you.
And you, too, Miss Forsythe.
Mother, this is
Miss Maggie Tilton.
Maggie, this
is my mother.
Please to meet you,
Mrs. Forsythe.
Why, and you, Miss Tilton.
We just got these
cups and plates in
from Pennsylvania.
I think they're
the very thing,
but Pa thinks
they're too fancy.
What do you think?
Oh...
they're so elegant.
But I have to try not
to look too hard
at things I can't afford.
How I wish we were sisters.
Oh, Miss Forsythe.
Thank you.
I doubt I've
ever received
a finer compliment.
Well, I mean it.
We were sisters, you could
help me reason with Pa
when he has a fit and decides
I'm trng to drive him to ruin
just by ordering
pretty crockery.
Why, Staffordshire
plates.
I'll have them all.
And the cups, too.
Though they are
rather plain.
Mrs. Scull,
I haven't yet
finished inventorying
the shipment.
There's more than
Are you sure
you want them all?
You must recall I run
a mansion, Miss Forsythe.
So box them back up and
I'll send a servant for them.
What the negroes
don't break,
I can throw at Inish next time he drips tobacco juice
on my fine table cloth.
Haven't seen you riding lately,
Madam Scull.
Oh, the quirts
aren't for my horses.
They're for my negroes.
Good day, Miss Forsythe.
I can't seem to keep
track of my thimbles
for some reason.
Well, thimbles
I can supply.
If it was news of those
wild ranger boys
you were hoping for,
I'm bound to disappoint you.
Suppose they're still
up on the plains
chasing Comanche
horse thieves,
freezing their ears off.
Yes, it's been
sharp weather.
I expect they're cold.
Miss Tilton...
I'd be pleased
if you call me Clara.
I wish Captain Scull would
just give up on Kicking Wolf.
I'd like to hightail it
back to Austin, see Clara.
I'd like to sneak into Buffalo
Hump's camp and kill him.
That's my thinking.
We'll have to fight him
sooner or later anyway.
See now, that's the difference
between me and you, Woodrow.
I mostly think about love,
you mostly think about war.
Yeah.
If he don't stop soon,
I'm gonna dismount
right here and die.
I'm so cold and tired,
can't tell up from down.
I'm gonna have
to quit rangering
if I have to spend
too much time
in a place where I can't
tell up from down.
Quit and do what?
All you know how to do is
ride horses and shoot guns.
you quit rangering,
you'd starve.
Now, that's a rash
statement, Woodrow.
There he is,
the raal.
He ain't a rascal,
he's our scout.
Oh, what good's
a scout who goes off
and doesn't report
but every three days?
Hey, what got him
so riled?
Besides that,
he beat me at cards.
You must've swallowed
a badger, Gus.
I swear you're
surly today.
Shut up.
Where's Captain off
to in such a hurry?
He's going to the place where
Kicking Wolf and his warriors
butchered most
of the stolen horses.
Kicking Wolf only wanted
the three stallions.
Any meat left?
Yes.
Maybe the captain'll let
Deets cook us up a bunch.
Ain't you coming?
No.
I'm going to see
my grandmother.
She's old.
She may want to tell me
a few more stories
before she dies.
Well, how are we supposed
to catch Kicking Wolf
without you to track?
Kicking Wolf is much too quick
for Big Horse Scull
to catch.
Scull might as well go home.
And let a horse thief
get clean away?
That's not the captain's habit.
Kicking Wolf
is the best
horse thief in the world.
Is Big Horse Scull
the best captain in the world?
Scull Mansion
Austin,Texas
How come you did not go
with the captain, Jake?
The captain wanted me
to stay here in Austin.
Yeah, take care of the place
till he gets back.
But he said I can
go next time, so...
Hey, Felice, what
happened to you?
The missus.
The missus?
What, did you drop a plate?
Did you sass Madam Scull?
I didn't sass her.
I didn't drop no plate.
If you don't hurry
with that buttermilk,
Felice,
you'll get the quirting
of your life.
Don't interfere th
r slaves, Spoon.
Madam would like
to see you upstairs.
And you're late
as it is.
What am I late for?
If the madam says you're
late, you are late.
She wants help
with the drapes.
Now go.
Scat, you old possum!
uh, Butler said you needed help
with your drapes.
I suppose he meant...
I wanted you to undrape me.
Uh, what, ma'am?
"Come to my parlor,"
said the spider
to the fly.
Well, uh, wh...
what, uh, ma'am, uh...
Don't utter, Jakey.
Such lovely hair.
Ought to win you
many female hearts.
Come a little closer so I
can see your dimples better.
Well... I was just, uh...
supposed to trim the mare's
feet this afternoon.
I can't allow it.
Not today.
I should really...
Miss Scull...
I better...
What are you doing here?
Your white friends are gone.
Your son made me come.
He said you might want to torture
me for a while.
If you come into my camp.
I would hang you upside-down.
and put a scorpion in your nose.
I don't like Kickapoos.
This man has my protection.
Why did you interfere with him?
Because he's a stinking Kickapoo.
And he led the Rangers to us.
You should have brought me
Call's scalp.
Instead you defy me.
My horse.
I'm tired of ordinary horses.
Most horses are ordinary,Kicking Wolf.
The Buffalo Horse is not ordinary.
He is the most famous horse in the world.
That's a fine tracker.
He may be a fine tracker,
but I fail to see
that he's ours.
Mostly seems to track
for himself.
Well, that's just research,
Mr. McCrae.
The man is said to know
every creek
in between the Rio Grande
and the Columbia River Gorge.
Takes a lot of private tracking
to build that much knowledge.
I was in Buffalo Hump's camp.
His son Blue Duck took me
prisoner for a while.
But Buffalo Hump won't let
anyone kill me.
Well, that's new.
Why not?
I helped his grandmother
with her dying.
Kicking Wolf is following you.
Three Birds is with him.
Well, that's original.
First we follow him,
then he follows us.
Well, if it's just two of them,
let's go kill them.
At least that'll stop hihorse
stealing for a while.
You can't catch them.
They have better horses
than you.
If you try
to chase them,
they'll lead you
so far away,
you'll starve before
you can find your way back.
Well, I been out there before
and I didn't starve.
Here now, men,
I won't send you out
chasing a phantom
in country this spare.
We'll post a double guard
tonight.
Let's move.
That horse might be a witch.
Some sat it can fly.
It is too cold for the whites.
They're weak,and careless with
their horses.
Sheer,
absolu genius.
Stealing horses
is one thing,
but stealing Hector--
that's absolute genius!
It's still just
a horse thief
stealin' a horse.
We ought to be
chasing him
instead of standing around
talking about it.
Well, we been chasing
him for ten years now
and we ain't
caught him yet.
MCCRAE:
I'd like to see you go
into Buffalo Hump's camp
and steal one of
his horses.
Well, I don't claim
to be a horse thief.
And we can't catch him,
'cause we stop to sleep
at night and he don't.
What is a genius, anyway?
Aw, I guess
the captain's a genius.
You ought to ask him.
A genius is somebody
with six toes on one foot.
Well, I mean, at's
what I heard, anyway.
A genius ain't
got no warts.
MCCRAE:
Well, in that case, Ikey,
I'm a genius,
'cause I'm  rarely
troubled with warts.
I hear a genius
is desperate smart.
He's right.
I met one, once,
up in St. Louis.
And he could
spell words backwards,
and even say numbers
backwards, too.
Well, what's the point
of spelling backward
You spell backwards, you
wouldn't have much of a word.
Pig.
I wish we had us
a good ol' fat pig.
Quiet, now, Lee.
No one was
discussingwine.
No one was discussing
much of anything.
Lee's got as much right
to talk as you have.
All right, Captain's coming.
We'll soon have our orders.
Firearms... slicker.
Slicker!
Need to be
traveling light.
Sir.
Thank you.
A man should be able to go
from Cape Cod to California
with no more gear than this.
And if he can't, he deserves
to die where he drops, I say.
CALL:
Sir, the Comanches
know where we are.
You'll get scalped,
for sure.
Or freeze to death.
With all respe, Captain,
why on earth would you
strike out on foot?
The tragedy of man, gentlemen,
is not death or epidemic
or lust or rage
or even scalping, Mr. Call.
No, sir, the tragedy
of man is boredom.
Boredom!
A man can only do a given thing
so many times with
freshness and spirit,
and then, no matter
how lively the sport,
it becomes a bore.
Now, I love cards and whoring,
but even cards and whoring,
after awhile, become boresome.
You can top your wife
a thousand times,
and that becomes tedioustoo.
Sir, I don't see
what this has to do
with you just walking off
and leaving us.
Well, opportunity, Mr. Call.
Opportunity and adversity
are kissing cousins.
So, we'll be leaving you now,
gentlemen.
Famous Shoes is going
to teach me how to track
while he follows my horse.
But, Captain,
what about us?
What could be simpler?
Go home.
Mr. McCrae, Mr. Call, I'm
making you co-commanders.
See these fine gentlemen
get home to Austin
and see that they get
paid right away.
So we're just
to go home, then.
Yes. Home.
If you encounter
any rank bandits
alonthe way, hg them.
Otherwise, report
to the governor
and get drunk till I show up.
Well, what do we tell
Mrs. Scull?
Oh, Inez is my
problem, not yours.
If I were you, I'd just
try to avoid her.
Sir, I'd be worried if I was her
and you disappeared.
Well, that shows
how little you know
of marital affairs,
Captain McCrae.
Inez won't be worried,
she'll just be mad.
We're captains now,
Woodrow.
Yeah. I reckon.
If I wasn'awake,
I'd think I was asleep.
I'd think I was
a dream.
It ain't a dream, you fool.
Now, don't you be bossing me
too hard today, Gus.
I need a day or two
to adjust to the notion
that you're a captain.
I order you
to shut up about it.
Woodrow's a captain, too.
He going to be
a lot harder boss than me,
once he gets a hang of the job.
Get the hang of it?
Surviving's the hang
of it, Augustus.
Bill, no more...
...wrestle with an Indian than
to try to reason with you!
Which way you think
we ought to go?
Well, aren't you
gonna say something?
You been yappin' ever
since I known you.
Why you suddenly dry up?
Well, where do you
think we ought to go,
if you know so much?
Well, I don't
know so much.
I been taking orders the
whole time I been a Ranger.
Why would I know
any more than you do?
Because you're a studier,
Woodrow.
You been reading in that book
about Napoleon for years now.
Me, I'm mainly
just a whore.
BILL:
I don't know what
made the captain decide
to make them two in charge.
They'd both argue with a stump,
if the stump could talk.
Sure don't seem like the
sensible thing to do, Bill.
One of 'em says yes,
the other says no.
Well, captains ought to
stay with their troops.
Gus and Call decide
to leave us...
we'll be lost, for sure.
All right...
I favor trying
for the Red River.
If we go west, we end up
eating the horses.
Got those extra mules.
I say we eat the mules, if we
have to, and make for the Red.
There's settlements
along the Red,
and plentiful
game, too.
Red was my thinking, too.
Oh, is it, now.
The boys are
depending on us.
We got to keep our heads
and do it right.
No, not today, you don't.
Mind your words, Ben.
Let me pass.
No! Not today
and not tomorrow
and not the next day
and the next week and
not the next month.
Not ever.
I been coming here every day
for nearly three weeks now.
What's wrong with today?
There's nothing wrong
with today.
Just be gone.
I'll be calling the sheriff
on you, if you don't.
And he'll know what to do
with a common lark like you.
Yeah, all right then.
All right, there ain't
no need to call the sheriff.
Why, thanks, Felice.
You're the only one that
don't hate me around here,
it looks like.
I thought I instructed
my butler to run you off.
How come you're not gone?
Ben?
I was just resting
a minute.
Get off my step.
I don't want you
round here anymore-- Ben!
You stay away from
that yellow wench.
I don't want any
little irregularities
with my help.
But I thought you liked me.
Like you?!
I've stooped to many follies
in my life,
but I doubt I'd
allow myself to like
a common farm boy
such as yourself.
MAN :
See you first of next week!
It was your hair, Jakey.
Your thick, lovely hair.
I suppose I found it
briefly appealing.
But now it's gone,
and that is that.
Mr. Spoon.
You call Woodrow Call...
Woodrow.
Why won't you call me Jake?
Look, I got money.
All right?
I ain't a cheat.
What are you standing
over there for?
I'm ready.
Hey, I'a Ranger, too.
Just like Ca.
You're still a whore,
ain't you?
Now get over here.
Can I ask you to take off
your boots... Jake?
You been in some mud.
Could you...
could you just help me?
Just...
something is burning
Captain, over here!
Oh, Lord!
He was just a you'un.
Keep watching, boys.
They may still be close.
They are close.
There. See that dust?
That's our villains.
Killed the grandad and the boy
'cause they couldn't keep up.
They took the women.
We have to take the captives to Buffalo Hump.
If he says you can have the woman,
you can do what you want with her.
I want to do it here and now.
Take the horses and go.
I'm going to kill the woman.
You're, uh, you're
safe now, ma'am.
We need to go.
There could be 40 more
not far away.
Or 400 more.
My John...!
he won't have me no more!
I'll run and
catch her, Captain,
see if I can talk her back.
She's right, you know?
What do you mean, Bill?
Comanche's have had her.
Her husband won't
want her no more.
It's worse than that, Pete.
Nobody will want her.
Missus! Miss!
I can't go back!
I can't!
You got to go
back, Miss.
The little girls
need you.
It's all right, it's
all right, missus.
It's all right now.
Come on.
Let's go back now.
Let's go back now.
I don't know what Ahumado will do
when he sees that I have brought him
the Buffalo Horse.
You think he will give you some
young women as a reward?
Of course he should give me a
woman or two.
Ahumado doesn't do
what he should do.
What if he has Goyeto skin you?
Then I'll be skinned.
We are going to the Yellow Cliffs.
And I don't plan to die.
Hector leaves
a damn large track.
Kicking Wolf and Three Birds
are walking towards Mexico.
If he is takinthe Buffalo
Horse to Ahumado,
he hopes to go home
with some new wives.
I'd say he's taking
a big risk if he thinks
he can work a simple trade
with that crafty Mayan.
Back in Boston,
saddle of antelope
is considered to be
a great delicacy.
Of course, it's
a rare delicacy, too,
there being very few
pronghorns
in the region
of Boston town.
You walk fast for a white man.
I can walk off
and leave
most white men.
Do you know this Ahumado,
also called "Black Vaquero"?
No one knows Ahumado.
When he was born,
the poison leaf was put
under his tongue.
Because of that,
he could do nothing but evil.
Evil is correct.
We attacked him
in that slaver's den of his.
The Yellow Cliffs one,
he shot Hector and got away.
It rankles me still.
Yellow Ciffs
Northern Mexico
You remember that...
that slick Comanche,
the expert horse thief?
The one who, uh, traded
u horses for women?
Why is that boy yelling so?
He let the cougar get
one of my foals.
I don't raise horses
for cougars to eat.
Goyeto's working on him.
The Comanche, he has stolen
the Buffalo Horse from Scull.
I think he's
bringing him here.
And that ain't
the best of it.
The best of it
is that Scull's
following on foot.
He's got that Kickapoo
tracker with him.
He wants his horse back,
I reckon.
Is anyone alive
in the cages now?
I ain't checked today,
but, uh, I doubt it.
Scull tried to kill me once...
and failed.
I tried to kill him...
and failed.
I didn't expect him
to come back.
The Rangers
is back.
It's the Rangers.
Yeah, coming in!
Looky there.
Look, children.
Billy! Billy! Bill!
Billy!
Billy! Billy!
What a sight.
Hey, Jake, come get
this horse for me, buddy.
Oh, Pearly. Pearly, Pearly,
Pearly, Pearly.
Oh, Pearly.
Oh, Billy, thank God
you're safe.
Oh, my darling.
Oh, I could squeeze you in two.
Where's Captain Scull?
Was he killed?
Not that we know of.
H's chasing a horse thief.
Don't be tagging us
now, Jake.
Got a urgent business
to attend to.
Urgent business?
Hello, Mr. Forsythe.
I don't see
Clara anywhere.
She ain't sick,
is she?
I'm trying to count
these gloves.
It takes concentration.
Sorry, sir.
Traveled nearly
to the North Pole and back.
Anxious to see Clara.
She ain't sick, is she?
My daughter's never been sick
a day in her life.
She's as healthy as a horse.
She's out.
Out?
Out!
That's the opposite of in,
Mr. McCrae! She's gone!
She n't here!
Running errands, I reckon.
Well, I got to report
to the Governor, sir.
Hope you tell her
I called.
Darn.
Don't you go
getting drunk
on me, Gus.
The Governor will be
wanting us to report.
You go, Woodrow.
I got other things on my mind.
Now, we're both captains.
We should both go.
Well, I swear.
You're not... Jake!
Stable... stable
this horse!
You tell Captain Call
he can find me
in the saloon
if he needs me.
If he wants me to visit that
governor, he better come quick.
Why, you leaving again?
It's not leaving.
I'll be departing from
my right mind.
Kicking Wolf
has taken your horse
into the Sierra.
Three Birds is
still with him,
but Three Birds
does not want to go
into the Sierra.
How can you tell
all that from a track?
I can't.
I know Three Birds.
Three Birds is not crazy.
Only a crazy man
would ride into the country
of Ahumado.
Well, that qualifies me
for the asylum then.
Ahumado is always
behind you.
If we go into
his country,
he'll be behind us.
Maybe I should start
walking backwards.
If you couldn't kill
Ahumado
when you had your Rangers
with you,
why do you think
you can kill him now?
Lots of things can go wrong
with a military unit.
Sometimes a man alone
can do better.
I'm a born fighter.
I need opponents to match me.
Perhaps the Black Vaquero
will match me,
but I doubt it.
I don't want the salt
to lose its savor.
Do you understand?
No.
Well, I guess this means you
don't choose to accompany me.
No.
What will you be doing
while have my little contest
with the Black Vaquero?
There's a whole in the Earth
somewhere to the west.
Turtle brought the Kickapoo
people out of that hole
and into the sunlight.
I want to find it.
My task is simpler.
I just want my Hector back.
Thank you for your help.
er table manners
is to drink from a glass.
Or from a saucer.
No, no, not
a durn saucer.
Saucer might do
for sipping coffee
if it's too hot
to imbibe from the cup.
Does that suit ya?
And don't call me Captain.
Plain Gus McCrae.
Hello, Bingham.
Hello, Captain.
Got the buggy ready.
Governor wants to see you.
You're as broad as
this buggy, Bingham.
A man who sits behind you
don't have much of a view.
Nosir.
Get a view of me mostly.
Hey, get up.
I'm surprised
you drink like that
before you say
hello to Clara.
MCCRAE:
Why would I say
hello to her?
I seen her in a buggy with
that horse trader Bob Allen.
He's been trying to steal
her from me.
I guess he succeeded.
That wasn't
Bob Allen, you fool.
That was her uncle
from Galveston.
He's come for a visit.
Her uncle?
Gus?
Bye.
What?
What is your hurry?
You just got here.
You been gone
over a month.
It's the governor.
I gotta report.
Old Scull left us
in the lurch.
At least Woodrow and
got made captains.
It's the governor, Clara.
Well, if it wasn't
the governor,
it would be
somebody else.
A Comanche you had to fight
or a bandit you got to catch.
Gus...
Oh.
My Ranger.
You mean Inish has lost himself
and over a damn horse?
It was his
war horse, Governor.
He held that horse
in high regard.
Yes, and what about his duty
to the State of Texas?
Did he hold that
in high regard?
I guess he thought we
could get the boys home safe.
We done it.
We recovered
those captives, too.
Yes.
Though I doubt the woman
will recover.
They rarely do.
Inish Scull
used good judgment
in making you captains.
And I'll second it.
You both got a bright future...
if you can keep your hair.
Now, meanwhile,
we got thousands of hostile
Comanche's to contend with.
And a whole nation
to the south of us
who don't like us one bit.
And the worst is,
he's left us with Inez.
I believe we can hold our
own with the Comanche
and I expect we can
whip back e Mexicans,
but the heavens
are going to ring
when Inez Scull finds out
why her husband didn't
care to come home.
Ed?!
ED:
From my reports,
they did a fine job, Inez.
Only lost one man,
and that from
natural causes.
Two if you count Inish.
I decline to be impressed.
They both need barbering.
And this one slouches.
What kind of
soldier slouches?
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we ain't soldiers.
We're Texas Rangers.
In rangering, posture
ain't the important thing.
Oh.
And what is the important thing?
Guts, plain guts.
ED:
All right,ow, McCrae,
Mrs. Scull is just upset
because the Captain didn't
come home with the troops...
INEZ:
Oh, shut up, Ed!
I'm not so ill-bred
as to be upset.
I'm angry, and I detest
un-barbered louts!
I imagine these two
green ears of corn
both put whoring
before barbering.
Most men would, Inez.
It's only normal.
Why, Ed, you got more
spunk than I thought.
Captain went looking
for his horse, ma'am.
No, he left to spite me.
Hector was just an exce.
He'd just as soon eat
a horse as ride one.
:
Have them go
fetch him, Ed.
Inez, they just got back.
They need to rest
and so do their horses.
INEZ:
All right.
but they mustn't
wait long
or Inish will vanish
for good if given the chance.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
all right, all right, all right.
All right.
You will send them?
Thank you, Ed.
Slouchy as you are,
I might like you
to come to tea at my house.
What about Captain Call?
Too stiff.
Bye.
Well, I do apologize,
gentlemen.
I brought you in here
to compliment you on
your captaincies,
but Inez barged in
and spoiled it.
Why come home just to be
ate alive by your wife?
Inish Scull is a Yankee
son of a bitch
and his wife is a...
Southern slut.
Inez Scull would try
the patience of a saint.
Why, I believe she would even
try the patience of Job.
I don't know Job, sir,
but she sure tried mine.
Lord
Kicking Wolf, I assume.
You're the genius
that stole my horse.
Which I see, incidentally,
you don't have.
Tit for tat.
Bible and sword.
There is a pit down there.
I could put you in it.
But your name is Three Birds.
You should enjoy one of our cages.
That way you can watch your friends,the birds.
These cages are filthy.
I don't want to be in one.
If he doesn't like our cages...
take him down.
Let Goyeto work on him.
You are stupid man.
A child could fool you.
Scull is coming.
He is not a child.
Why does he stand there night
after night?
I want runners to go out to all
the bands.
To the Antelope Comanche.
To Threes Bears.
We will fight as one band.
We will raid all the way to the ocean.
Why do we need the others?
We can kill the Texans without any help.
Do you kill Call when you went to kill him?
Or did he shoot you?
He was lucky.
He was better than you.
They will get stronger,until they
fight berrer than we fight.
You don't like to hear this.
But it's ture.
We must fighr the Texans
and defeat them,now.
Otherwise they will break us,and the
way of the Comanche will disappear.
To do this,we need all the bands.
Go.In seven days we go to the
Great Water.
We kill every Texan we find.
That was mighty tasty.
You're a fine cook, Maggie.
Thank you.
But I grew up in Virginia,
where there's more
vegetables to choose from.
Well, I can live without
too much greenery myself.
Woodrow...
I got some news.
I'm gonna have a baby.
What?
I said I'm gonna have a baby.
It's your baby, Woodrow.
My baby?
Well, it's ours, I mean.
Oh.
Well, Maggie, uh...
That  news.
I'm just hoping the governor
doesn't send you off after
Captain Scull.
Well, probably will.
That Scull's after him
hot and heavy.
You certain there's a baby?
I'm sure, Woodrow.
Well, uh, you know...
least  got some time
to think about it.
Hmm...
I suppose that
fella Bob Allen
gave up and went
back to Nebraska.
What makes you think so?
Well, if he ain't, and I
catch him making up to you,
he's likely to
get a whipping.
Gus, I don't know that
you could whip B,
and I'd much rather
you didn't try.
And why would you doubt
that I could whip him?
I'm a Texas Ranger.
Well, I reckon you
could shoot him.
But if it were fisticuffs
you were talking about...
I doubt you'd
stand much a chance.
Bob is stout.
That's one thing
I like about him.
Like about him?
You like about him?
Don't tell me you
two have been spooning
while I've been off
doing my duty.
Got your goat, didn't I?
Besides which,
we ain't married.
What I do while
you're off Rangering
is my business, Gussie.
Durn if you're not about as
independent as they come.
Gussie?
You didn't say good night.
I might've wanted a kiss.
Clara, I have had...
Durn you, Clara!
I get on my horse backwards,
which I'll never live down.
Now I t my hat on
backwards, too!
I won't tell.
:
God...
What was that clatter?
It was only Gus, Mama.
I was teasing him a little.
About what?
May I ask?
I just happened
to mention Bob Allen,
and it putim in a dither.
Well, it should have.
Bob Allen's a decent man
in a solid trade.
He'd make any woman
a fine husband.
:
I know, Ma.
But Gus McCrae
is my one true love.
There are two kinds of men
in this world, honey.
The marrying kind
and men like Gus.
You may have his heart, Clara,
but you'll never have the man.
He will wander God's green
Earth until the day he dies.
If you think you can settle
Gus McCrae down, Clara,
then you need
to think again.
Because you won't.
Whoa.
There goes your rival.
Mind your own business.
Clara thinks he can whip me.
I imagine he can whip you.
He's at least a foot taller
and maybe 50 pounds heavier.
Shut up! You don't
know nothing about it.
Maybe not.
But if I was looking
for a fistfight,
I wouldn't challenge Bob Allen.
Be common sense to look
for someone smaller.
Common sense be damned!
I'll whip him before breakfast,
then I'll probably whip you.
And maybe Long
Bill Coleman, too.
Why Long Bill?
Because he's always criticizing,
the damn schoolmarm, that's why.
That buffalo horse was,
uh... that was some horse.
Took more than four
days to cook him.
Bible and sword-- well, that is
a sight I never expected to see.
Mind cutting me off a slice?
I've had nothing but
varmints these last few days.
Hmm...
Let's see, uh...
This one's
about your size.
And I'd say you're dead.
If you can't catch
enough birds to eat,
I will put you
in my pit.
Well, the pigeons
seem plentiful.
Squab is always welcome
at the Scull table,
and it's best eaten rare,
of course.
No. I could hardly ask for more.
The Texans may try
to ransom you.
They might. I'm popular.
Why did you come here?
To kill you.
Why else?
Do you still believe
you will kill me?
I do, and I'm rarely mistaken.
Put him over.
That's wasteful, if you ask me.
I didn't ask you.
You're burning ammunition
we might need.
The governor wants
to see us pronto.
That durn governor
is becoming a pest.
Yeah.
Well, he's
the governor,
and we work for him.
Have you thrown
a three-day drunk
just 'cause Clara told you
she thought her other
beau could whip you?
I threw a three-day drunk
for pleasure, mostly.
I like three-day drunks.
Go along,
Captain Call.
Need a word
with Captain McCrae.
I'll be but a minute.
Aren't you even going
to speak to me?
Hello.
Oh, stop it, Gussie.
How long do I have
to be punished
for not doing anything wrong?
Who said you didn't
do anything wrong?
I say it, and you better listen!
All right, don't yell, now.
This horse is apt to throw me.
This the horse
you got on backwards?
Yep.
Why did you do that, Gus?
Because... I was so
in love with you
I couldn't tell backwards
from forwards.
That's better.
Will I see you tonight?
You bet.
Well, look at these.
All from generals and
senators and the like,
all telling me
I got to find Scull.
You would think
the sun might
refuse to shine
if Inish Scull
leaves out a pot.
He's rich, he's famous,
and he is the best military man
in this part of the country.
And he ain't here.
With the plains,
from what I hear,
starting to boil.
Well, Ben, what do you want?
We're busy.
My mistress is wanting
an answer, sir.
Request declined.
I did you a favor, Captain.
At least it's a favor
if you value your virtue.
I'd as soon take tea
with a grizzly bear, sir.
Well, I doubt
we've heard
the end of it.
Inez is nothing
if not persistent.
But to the business at hand.
Now, I want the two of you
to take some men
and find out what you can
about Inish Scull.
I want you to ride
fast, and hurry back.
If Inish is captive,
we need to know it.
Maybe he can be ransomed.
Our horses are
worn out, Governor.
I know.
Now, there is a horse trader
hereabouts named Allen.
Now, he brought in
some fresh horses
just yesterday.
Now, maybe we can
acquire a few from him.
I'll go see the man, then.
Well, choose your mounts,
gentlemen.
The State will compensate
Mr. Allen.
I'd like you to leave
as soon as possible.
We'll be gone by daybreak, sir.
Thank you.
Drat that man!
Ever since
's been made governor,
he's as pigheaded as Inish.
He is good at
catching pigeons,
but he will need to catch
some water when it rains.
I want you to climb up there
and give him a bowl.
Ah! I am not
a good climber.
Then this is your chance
to learn.
Scull is a famous man.
Texans will pay a
big ransom for him.
Then we will kill him.
What's the matter?
It's what's always the matter.
You're my only
sweetheart, Clara.
What could be the matter?
You're my sweetheart, too,
and now you're leaving again.
I'm a Ranger, honey.
Even though
I'm a captain,
I still ain't my own boss
much of the time.
Governor says go look
for Inish Scull,
that's what
I have to do.
I don't want to hear
your excuses anymore.
But it's the truth.
It's just the truth
you choose to hide behind
every time you leave me.
It is not written in the heavens
that you have
to be a Texas Ranger.
There are plenty of other
things you could do
that would be more settled.
Like what?
Well, yocould be a barber.
Or maybe even a judge.
Me a durn barber?
Well, maybe a judge
would suit you better.
If I was a judge,
I'd hang half the scoundrels
in this town,
and that would be that.
All right. Then I don't know
what you could be,
but you're my dearest
and my deepest, Gussie.
I just can't stand
all this leaving.
I... I simply can't.
We'll only be gone a week.
A week ain't long.
It is if you're lonely.
A week can be mighty long.
I'm not a woman
who does well alone.
Clara...
I want us to marry.
I want us to marry
when I come back.
you come back.
Damn it, Clara,
I'll come back.
I always come back.
I'll be with
Woodrow Call.
No one's more
cautious on the trail
than Woodrow Call.
I wish he would marry Maggie.
We all wish that.
He ought to, and
maybe someday he will.
But, right now, it's you
I'm worried about.
Well, you don't need
to worry about me too much.
Even if I was
to marry somebody else,
I still want you
to be my friend.
I still want you
to know my children.
Marry someone else?
What kind of talk is that?
children?
Why can't they be  children?
All ght. Don't
talk no more, Gus.
Hold me.
Hold me tight.
I doubt there'll be trouble.
We'll only be gone a week.
But if there is, you remember
that hideout I showed you.
I remember.
Come back safe, Woodw.
Remember what I said.
If there's trouble, be quick.
MCCRAE:
We'll need, uh,
Long Bill,
Stove Jones and
Ikey, I suppose.
Let's leave Ikey.
He's old, and we'll be
traveling night and day.
I think we should
take Jake.
That worthless pup?
WOODROW:
He's got to get a bit
of experience sometime.
Well, he'll need to
keep up and shut up.
Jake's a blabber.
Well, I heard you
blab a bit yourself.
We'll take Dietz,
PI, and be off.
what
？？
Hurry back
to me, Billy.
Don't get killed.
I won't,nless you
don't let go of me,
and they shoot me
for desertion.
I have to go.
Honey, don't run after me.
You'll jostle the bait.
Careful now, Clara.
MCCRAE:
Hard to leave my Clara.
She's the finest gal alive.
You don't think she'd go off
and do something silly, do you?
Like what?
Like marry that damned
horse trader from Nebraska.
Well, if she did, I don't
know that I'd call it silly.
Maybe he's a better
catch than you.
Well,  ain't.
And how would you
know anyway, Woodrow?
Where's he going,
Captain?
I don't know,
and he don't either.
Thank you.
Well, now I roped
the filly that
I really care about.
"Care about," Bob?
Well, yeah.
Well, I guess I  roped.
but nobody tightened
the loop.
And now... I'm not.
I tell you,
he's a witch.
I wish you would let me
cut out his tongue.
If he still thinks
he can kill me,
he needs to keep his spirits up.
So, he sings.
You complain again,
I will puncture your eardrums
with a thorn.
And you won't be bothered
when Scull sings.
The settlers and farmers are all along
the Brazos.
The river of Many Forks.
We will go down these forks.
and kill them.
Slow Tree can talk the Prairie
Dod Fork.
I will take the Clear Fork.
Slipping Weasel
can take the Double Mountain Fork.
We will meet near the town where
Scull and Call live.
We will burn it down.
It was in my youth
that the Texans practiceed
their treachery...
...under the lure of the white flag
...my father,my grandfather and
the grandfathers of many Pepole
trusted the Texans.
Many went in to parley without their weapons...
...only a few were wise,and hid
their knives...
Great chieftains of
the mighty Comanche nation.
...while the Texans surrounded the tent.
There is enough room
for all peoples
to live in harmony.
Now while we are strong
is the time of our revenge.
Are the signs good?
Yes.Many.Texans will die.
