That wasn't anything,
just the wind.
No sign of Ed yet?
Don't start getting panicky again.
He'll be back soon
But, Boss it's been over 3 hours
since you sent him up to that mind.
This waiting business
is getting my goat.
Especially in this creepy,
spooky dump like this.
Come on.
Lets get out...
Sit down! You're acting like
a bunch of half-baked kids
Nothing around here to hurt you.
The whole town has been deader then a
door nail for over thirty years.
Maybe it has, but ain't
saying what happened to Ed.
He'll show up pretty soon.
Isobel didn't I tell
you all to pussyfoot.
The boss up there sure be
sore if he know'd we followin' him.
Get going, Isobel.
Clarence what are you doing here?
Thought I told you to stay at the ranch?
B-but... Boss I figured
y'all needed protection.
I didn't know you were coming to
town all festered with ghosts.
Listen.
We're surrounded, boss.
Well, what's this?
but let the fate of it's
rider be a warning to anyone,
who attempts to enter
'The Sally Ann Mine.'
Phantom...
Spooks and the Phantom.
Boss, let's go back
to the ranch.
'The Sally Ann Mine.'
God sakes mas-ta John, you ain't
figuring on goin' to any haunted mine?
I'm following that horse.
You's followin' that horse?
We's followin' that horse.
I've got a hunch Ed's ain't coming back.
I am for leaving now.
What's the matter,
you gettin' yellow?
I ain't here for
my health either.
I told you I got a message
to come here and bring legal
proof of my half ownership
'The Sally Ann Mine'.
If you own half interest the
mine, why are we hiding
out in this spooky dump
like a bunch of rats.
Because I want to do a little
investigating before I show my hand.
Listen...
There's still plenty of gold
in that mine somewhere,
and I've got a hunch somebody's
trying to cut in on it.
-
-
Why, it's Ed's horse.
but let the fate of it's
rider be a warning to anyone,
who attempts to enter
'The Sally Ann Mine.'
- The Phantom...
- I wonder what happened to Ed?
- I told you we ought to get out of here.
- Let's go!
Wait a Minute!
There is gold in that mine!
Or they wouldn't be so
anxious to keep us away.
Shh.
Who are they?
The old guy is Tom Benedict.
He used to be superintendent
of the mine.
We're gonna find out
something right now.
Benedict.
Just why are you back in town?
And what are you trying to
pull back up at the Sally Ann?
No one has been near that worthless mine...
for years.
I'm no so sure it's worthless.
You ain't hanging on
there for nothing.
Joe Ryan, your father was
a bad man in this town.
What are you trying to do?
Live up to his record?
Listen to me you old carcass.
There's plenty of gold
in that mine somewhere.
And half of it belongs to me.
I've got a deed right
here to prove it.
Yes, and I have a pretty
good idea how you got it.
Why you old...
Just a minute!
And who invited you
into this game?
Looked to me like someone
was getting a dirty deal.
Just thought I would cut in.
Cutting in here ain't the
healthiest thing you could do.
I'll take that chance.
You boys better get movin'
Hold on there boys...
You all just get moving,
before I loses control.
Nice neighborly bunch of boys
you have here.
Say maybe you could tell us
where we could put up for the night?
You mean you intend to stay
in this town overnight?
Sure, why not?
Oh, well, we...
We have so few visitors.
And he ain't here
for nothing, either.
Mack, trail him
and see what he's up to.
Oh, so you've opened up
Bill Carter's old place, eh?
Hm?
Evidently you are no
stranger in these parts.
Well, I guess I should
have introduced myself.
I'm John Mason from over the ridge.
Got a little ranch over there.
Well... is it possible that you are
the son of Len Mason. Who...
Discovered the Sally Ann Mine
with old Bill Carter?
Dad left me his half interest
in the mine. But...
Well things have been so
dead around here, that...
I haven't given it
much thought for years.
So you're Len Mason's son, eh?
Perhaps it would be to your interest
to come in to the house for a while.
- Thanks.
- Boss?
Oh, uh
Use that house on the corner.
Go on, Clarence, hit the hay.
If you don't mine me and Isobel
just soon wait right here for y'all.
Aw, go get some sleep.
This must have been
quite a mansion in its day
Mrs Carter...
This is John Mason.
Oh, how do you do Mr Mason.
Mighty glad to meet
you Mrs Carter.
He is the son of your
fathers old partner.
Oh, this is a surprise.
I would say it is. I did not
know Bill Carter had a daughter.
And no one ever told me
that Len Mason had a son.
Well I reckon that makes us kinda
even to start with, doesn't it?
Uh, and I hope were just as good
friends as are fathers were.
Would you sit down?
Thanks.
Now tell me, what brings
you to Gold City?
Well, you see, I...
I own a half interest
in the mine here and...
Well I thought I would come
over and inspect it.
So you picked a night like
this to do your inspecting?
- Well you see I...
- Oh come on now confess.
Did you get a message too?
Yes... But I don't
understand it.
The mine has be abandoned
for years.
And the message I received
wasn't even signed.
Just demanded my presence
to protect my interests.
Well at lest there's a
reason for your note.
But... I can see why
I should get one.
See my father lost his share of
the mine long before his death.
Gee, that is odd.
When did you receive
your message?
About a week ago.
I just finished school in Denver.
The note sounded so mysterious,
well, it seemed like a log.
But... now that I am here, there something
uncanny and weird about everything.
This house and the people in it.
I feel like... Well...
Like I am... Like someone is always
watching and spying and Listening
Like a mysterious presence
lurking somewhere.
I am sure there is nothing
to be afraid of.
Why there Benedict, he
seems friendly enough.
But that's just it.
I'm not so sure of him either.
He refuses to explain anything.
He says he doesn't know
who sent for me or why.
He reminds me of a sphinx.
Oh, you mustn't let your nerves get the
best of you like this.
- But ah...
- I know how you feel.
But I've got a hunch that
everything's gonna turn out all right.
Perhaps it will...
Now that there someone here
whom I think I can trust.
Isobel... I sure
got the creeps.
It feel like ghosts, spooks and
phantoms is all around here.
The only thing for us to do,
is to try our lady luck.
But... does us throw snake eyes,
us don't move another foot.
Seven... fall right
out of heaven.
Isobel ain't nothing going to
bother little Clarence now.
No, sir.
Ah... Ah...
Ooh!
-
-
Master John! Master John!
Where's you all at boss?
What the matter Clarence?
What's the matter...?
A million monsters...
They slap me in the face.
Grabbed me by the
sit of the pants,
and then kicked me
right out the door.
Now wait a minute, you've
been seeing things.
Yes sir! Seeing them, hearing
them and feeling them.
All right, you wait
out here in the hall
Now sit down here and I
will be out shortly.
Yes sir.
Now who in the world was he?
Oh, just Clarence, my self
appointed body guard.
Sort of a man Friday, but the best
cook we ever had at the ranch.
-
- What is it?
A black figure
just went up those stairs.
Somebody just went up those steps.
You couldn't have missed him.
I've been in bed.
But I swear
no one's come up here.
Where have you been?
He's deaf and dumb.
Boss, boss. D-don't you think we
oughta go on back to the ranch?
You go on back to the house.
I'm going for a little ride
But-But, boss, boss...
The strangers headed for the mill there's a
light up there. Looks like he got a signal.
Well I will soon find out.
Come on, boys.
Look.
Mack, you stay
with the horses.
Hold on there, pardner.
Oh, it's you is it?
Stick'em up.
What are you doing up here?
Ask him.
What's your game?
What are you doing up
here on my property?
A dummy, eh.
Well, we'll find a
way to make you both talk.
Don't shot! Dead men
can't tell us anything.
Come on, let's get him.
Why now that it's day light maybe we can
find out what's happened to Ed.
Well, you fellas stay here and I'll go
over to the mine and take a look around.
Mack, go over
and saddle up my horse.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mr Benedict I'll tell you quite frankly
this situation is getting on my nerves.
Someone should be ably to tell
me who sent for me and why.
I know nothing
Tell me honestly. Have you have no idea
who could have sent that message?
I can't understand it myself.
Because Joe Ryan out there...
...holds the half interest in the mine that
rightfully belong to you.
That rightfully belongs to me?
Why, what do you mean?
Ryan's father got it when
he framed Bill Carter.
Framed him!
He railroaded your father to prison, so
he could steal your interest the mine.
Oh.
Well, I'm beginning
to understand.
- I am going to talk to Mr Ryan.
- He is a dangerous character.
I will be careful. But I simply have
to find out what this is all about.
-
-
-
- Help, help!
-
- Help, help!
Help!
Oh...
- Where am I?
- You'll be all right now.
Well whats the matter?
You've spoiled everything.
Well you called for
help didn't you?
Well, of course I did but
I wanted Mr Ryan to save me.
- Ryan?
- Yes...
I deliberately planned it. I planned
to get his confidence and...
and you come along,
and you spoil it all.
Gee I sorry but... what did you
want of Ryan confidence.
Just a present, he has
legal possession of the half
interest of the mine that
rightfully belongs to me.
What?!
Benedict told me... Ryan's father
stole my share of the mine.
Listen... I got an idea.
We'll get Ryan, alright. We'll
put him right where he belongs.
But how?
Come on, I'll tell you while
we're riding.
Boss you like to
scare me to death.
Now listen Clarence... there maybe some
reason for you to be scared at night.
But what is there to
be afraid of now?
The night amended. But my
nervousness just lingers on.
Clarence I want you to
ride over to the ranch...
...and to tell Bob to give
you one thousand dollars.
A thousand dollars!
What you gonna do with
thousand dollars.
You can't spend a nickel
in this here town.
You just never mind that. You just get the
money and get back here in a hurry.
Take the road by the cemetery.
In a town like this,
where he can't spend a nickel.
I don't know what he'd want
a thousand dollars in this town.
Must be
up to something.
Well, he'll find us
on the job all right.
- What's he want with a thousand dollars.
- I can't tell you all right now.
Nothing to worry about though.
- Here you are Clarence.
- Thank you master Bob.
That's a lot of money, don't you
want someone to ride over with you?
No sir. Boss doesn't
want any of you messin' around.
I's takin' good care of him and got
everything under perfect control.
All right.
What do you suppose he
wants all that money Bob?
I don't
understand that, boys.
Isobel, get going.
Isobel, lady luck
sure is with us.
Put'em up.
They is up.
Come on, let's have that money! Be quick
about it before we fill'ya full of holes.
Boss y-y'alls m-mistaken... me and
money have been strangers for years.
Come on, give us that money.
I got it boys!
Now, beat it.
-
-
Duke. Duke!
-
-
That black boy sure was scared.
Did you see though eyes?
Somebody will sure be surprised when
he shows up without that dough.
Sorry to interrupt
you boys again.
You did waste any time
catchin' up with my money.
Well Ryan it appears to me
you gentlemen are ready,
to tackle almost anything
to earn an honest dollar.
Keep 'em Ryan!
Boss that's our money.
They done held me up.
I know it, that's why
I sent you for it.
- Oh...
- Get their guns.
Yes, sir.
Put then in the water
barrel Clarence.
Yes, sir.
Come on, get movin'
there, Clarence.
Throw'em in.
Who are you?
I am John Mason and for your information I
own half interest in 'The Sally Ann Mine'
Um, sorta makes
us partner then, eh?
I thought of that Ryan.
I don't care much for having
a crook for a partner.
No. So what are you
going to do about it?
Well I am going to make
you a little proposition.
And that's where
the thousand dollars comes in.
Trying to bluff me, eh?
Listen Ryan, I have enough evidence against
you all to put you right where you belong.
Return the deed to the mine or
I will do a stretch for stealing my money.
- Why That's...
- That's my proposition.
Now, make up your mind.
Looks like
he's got us, boss.
Make out the transfer
in the name of Janet Carter.
I'll give you rats just exactly
ten minute to get out of town.
And if you ever show up around here
again I may not be so generous.
Wait a minute!
Clarence?
Lordy Boss... a spook...
the phantom himself...
...done snitch it.
Ye-Ye-Yes, sir!
Come on now beat it.
Get out!
Get him out of there
boys. Tie him up.
Hold'em there till I get a rope.
Hey fellas, that looks
like a mine tunnel.
Get that lantern
and bring that darky.
Mack, you and bud
stay and watch him.
Bring him along.
Come get down there
and keep on moving.
Boss don't send me down in that hole
there I'm a nervous wreck already.
Come get on down there.
Hurry up.
Lord you know what you done for Daniel...
see what you all can do for me.
Move on, smokey.
Quit stallin'
-
-
Get back there.
That's only an old shovel.
They done started to
dug my grave already.
Go on get go there.
Cut out making that noise.
Well, that water sure didn't
do these guns any good
Boss we done come to
the devil's crossroad.
We better go back.
Yea well we'll try this one.
Get goin'.
Well?
Boss the spirit I'm willing,
but the flesh is stalling.
- Snap along.
- Boss...
Come on, get goin'.
Boss that's all there is of it.
There ain't no more.
Maybe that's
the angel Gabriel callin' us.
Come on slime, let's see
what's up this ladder.
It looks like a coffin chief.
Shh.
Hold it there.
You?
Where's Mrs Carter?
What have you done with her?
It ain't what we have done, it's what we're
gonna do unless you leads us to that gold.
I know nothing about any gold!
Listen there gold in that mine somewhere
and you're going to take me to it.
I haven't been near
that mine in years.
Then why does that tunnel
lead to this room?
You'll take us to where
that gold is hidden,
or it'll be too bad
for both of ya.
Come on get goin'.
Get goin'
Come on, come on.
Don't worry child.
Cut out the gabbin'
and shove on.
It' just me Clarence.
Just me. Clarence
Washington Brown.
You're pretty tricky, ain't ya?
Alright cut out your
stalling. Move on.
Put'em up.
Tie'em up,
Benedict.
Stand back there Benedict.
Let'em loose, Tom.
We've been wondering
what happened to you Ed.
I'm alright.
Get me outta this.
And who are you anyway?
I'm... Bill Carter.
The man your father
framed and sent to prison.
Yes, dear,
he's your father.
I know your game Carter. You sneak
back to steal the gold you hid.
Where is it?
Why you scum. This mine was drained
to the penny 30 years ago.
You didn't pull this phantom
business for nothing.
There gold here somewhere and
you're gonna tell us where it is.
What's the matter Duke?
Don't you know me?
It's just me, Clarence.
Duke, I's gonna show'em
a phantom what is a phantom.
Look out...!
It's just me... Boss, Clarence.
Oh, untie me. What's happened?
There's a million spooks down
there and their rattly.
But the main thing is
they got Mrs Janet.
What?
When Ryan comes in
and grabs her, I ups and left.
Come on.
I is the phantom.
He ain't no phantom
with that watermelon accent.
I is the phantom.
Sure as you all's born,
I is the phantom.
I hopes to die
if I ain't the phantom.
- Come on.
- No use chasing him.
We got to fine Ryan.
Well, let's ride
to the shack above the mine.
I guess
they didn't believe me.
...by the time I got down
here she had vanished.
Where is Benedict.
I thought you couldn't talk!
Wait a minute Mason.
Bill Carter is alive.
He invented the phantom to protect the
gold for his daughter and for you.
But Clarence said Ryan found a passage.
That they had taken Janet.
Here! Here's the panel.
It's locked.
There are two secret
entrances to the mine.
One on the hill near
the powder house.
The other in the mill.
Keep to your right
in the tunnels!
- Are you going to talk.
- Stop it.
Can't you see
you are killing him. Oh.
Get back you dill.
Get-Get away from me
Get back, get away, get out of there.
Uh... Yeps, uh.
Giddap!
Giddap!
-
-
Duke! Duke!
Duke, come here boy!
To the ranch, Duke,
and get the boys.
Listen y'all how 'bout exploring
that secret passage?
That an idea, get the
lantern and lead the way.
- Keep an eye on them Slim.
- All right.
Oh John it's been terrible.
My father...
They've been torturing him.
Not so fast.
Well if it ain't my
old partner Mr Mason.
Tie him up, Ed
Turn him loose, Tom.
Carter you are going to
lead us to where that gold
is or none of ya are gonna
see daylight again.
Oh, Father, if there is
any gold, show them where it is.
All right, Ryan.
Back this way.
Come on boys they
can't get away.
Lady luck I's depending on you.
Tell me what's next.
Snake eyes.
Bye-bye, blackbird
It's a cave in boys!
Clarence.
Boss?
I's arrived.
Are you alright boy?
Can you get outta there?
I don't know, but I'm trying.
Well?
There it is.
Look gold and plenty of it!
Guess I knew
what I was talkin' about.
Slim go get Benedict wagon and bring
it to the entrance of the mine.
Alright, fellas help
me lug this out.
Hurry up Clarence
get me out of this.
Yes sir.
Lord, my head's spinnin'...
like a top.
Whoa... look.
Why, that's
the boss's horse.
I've never seen him
act this way before.
If he's in trouble,
we'll get him out of it.
There's only one way to head them off.
That's up this shaft.
Oh, be careful their desperate.
- There's a lot more back there boss.
- Well, make it snappy.
Look.
Let's get outta here.
Up!
Giddap!
Hyah!
Giddap!
Come on, boy, giddap!
My face red.
