Wonderin' if you folks
might let me climb aboard.
Uh-uh.
I don't take no blue bellies
on board, mister.
War's over, driver.
I'm willin' to pay.
Yellowbacks.
Yankees killed both my brothers
at First Manassas.
I'll tell you somethin',
there ain't enough money
in the state of Colorado
to buy passage on this rig.
What's the problem, Johnny?
Well, there ain't
no problem, Chance.
It's just that, seems
one of Mr. Lincoln's boys
has lost his way,
that's all.
Sorrell came up lame.
I was hopin' I might be able
to climb aboard
and get a lift
to the next town.
Don't see any harm in lettin'
this poor sod aboard, Johnny.
Chance!
You of all people.
It's like he said.
War's over.
Lieutenant Kirby Scott,
ma'am.
Rebekah Shepard.
This is my father
Jedediah.
After my momma died, my father
and I elected to come west.
We're joining my sister.
She's already got a business
established in Rampart.
How about you, son?
Mustered out
of Fort McHenry, sir.
Week after Appomattox.
That didn't
take you long.
Homestead Act, sir.
Figured I better get out here
and get some land
before the rest of Mr. Lincoln's
army beats me to it.
Ah, well, if it's land you're
looking for, you're in luck.
My father's a new land agent.
Jedediah Shepard
at your service.
So you're gonna be
a Sodbuster.
Something against
honest work?
Just sounds like, uh...
work.
And you?
Gambling? Robbery?
Shiftless lay about?
Lieutenant! I hardly think
that's appropriate.
Were it not for this man,
you'd hardly be aboard
this conveyance.
Whoa now! Whoa!
Ho!
Anybody goes for a gun
and I'll break her neck.
That includes you, Banker!
Go on.
Hand 'em over, boys.
Be quick about it.
All of you.
Out with your hands high.
You leave these passengers
alone, mister.
Do you want to join
your brother, Johnny?
Come on! Come on!
Well, look what we got here.
A real blue belly.
Let's get a rope
and string him up right now.
Don't get itchy, boys,
and you won't get hurt.
Lemme see that piece.
Well, will you look
at this.
What are you,
some kind of fancy gun thrower?
Actually,
I'm an ornithologist.
Ooh! I'd be horny too,
ridin' next to this
sweet little thing.
I think she oughta
come back with us.
Keepin' me mighty warm
at night.
Step back or I'll give you
the bellyful of lead
I should've given
you at Shiloh.
Quiet!
Now let's get
what we came here for, boys.
Law's gonna catch up
to you one day, partner.
Well, I am just quaking
in my boots, Johnny.
It's locked, boss.
Turn the box around.
Anybody else?
There's a fortune
in here, boss.
It's about time.
That's government money.
You'll never get away... Eh!
No!
Maybe that'll teach you some
respect, Mr. Government agent.
Stop it, please.
Just stop it.
Leave him alone.
Just take the money
and leave us alone.
Take what you came for
and get out.
Grab the strongbox
and the mail.
Bring it to my horse.
Now don't go spendin'
all that
before we get back to town.
You know what to do.
You haven't got
a problem with that,
now do you, Lassiter?
You can't do this.
It's cold-blooded murder.
Maybe we can make an exception
in your case, honey.
Sha!
Come on, come on.
It'll be first light
in less than an hour.
Gut shoot him and let's get
this thing over with.
Lieutenant!
Let's get out of here.
Johnny!
Let's get him in the coach.
Are you all right, sir?
I think so.
Lieutenant!
We need a hand here.
Be careful.
He's hurt pretty bad.
I've never seen
anything like this.
The two of you,
you almost seemed
like you were one person.
We should.
I don't understand.
He's my brother.
Whoa now! Whoa! Whoa!
JT!
Sheriff!
What's the ruckus, Johnny?
Find Doc Gaylen. We got
a wounded man in the coach.
Get away clean?
Whoa, boy.
Same outfit as last time.
You know, the hoods,
the whole works.
Howie, you round up
Doc Gaylen.
Matt, you and Mordechai
get him
up to Mother Smalley's.
Daddy, he's hurt.
Legs, legs.
Grab his legs.
Shhhew!
These two here gunned
half a dozen of 'em.
And if the leader
hadn't have grabbed
the box aforehand
and rushed off with it,
they'd have got him to.
You know how
teary-eyed I get
around these things,
big brother.
Why don't you, uh,
handle the formalities
with the Sheriff here,
and I'll, um,
be in my office.
Miss Rebekah?
My brother here?
He loves paperwork.
Appears like you
and your brother
happened along
in the nick of time.
That's just what anybody
would've done, sir.
I can assure you that ain't
the case, young fella.
Seeing as how there have been
six payroll robberies
in six weeks,
and nobody yet done nothin',
including me.
Your name?
Lieutenant Kirby Scott.
Or make that just Kirby Scott.
You wouldn't by any thought
be the Kirby Scott
from Little Roundtop,
Antietam,
Bull Run?
Yes, I've been
to those places, sir.
Been to those places?
Son, if you're the same
Kirby Scott I'm talkin' about,
we heard of you
even way out here
in this little one mule town.
No wonder Johnny there
thinks you're aces,
and he rode with Jeb Stewart.
There's a lot of heroes
in the war, Sheriff.
If you don't mind, I'd
just as soon not jaw about it.
Mindin' my own business don't
precisely come with this job,
if you know what I mean.
No offense.
I often wonder if folks
keep electin' me
because I'm naturally nosy,
or just not bein'
the swiftest bull
in the herd
don't qualify me
for much else.
Man needs to know
his limitations.
And able companions
they have become.
If these little facts
you'll swear to, if need be,
just put your John Henry
on that last line there.
What are your plans, son?
Don't suppose you'd consider
postin' here as my deputy?
That's a kind offer, sir,
but no.
It's a lousy offer.
And I don't blame you
one whip.
This town's been mouse quiet
since the mine shut down.
But with the war over,
folks are gonna come west
faster than goose grease
through a tin horn.
Neither me nor Marshall Boone
are gettin' any younger.
There's plenty of able-bodied
folk around.
Able-bodied ain't
what's in short supply.
Good luck, son.
# #
Bartender, you got any of that
Tennessee sippin' whiskey?
These boys drink
elephant piss.
Think they've gone
to hell.
Put away your money,
stranger.
First drink in town
always on Del Shannon.
Might that be the same
as on the house?
Might be.
Damn you,
you two-timin' sidewinder.
Hold it there, partner.
Do I know you?
You sure as hell
gonna remember me.
Hey, bartender, you move
any closer to that shotgun,
and I'll gut shoot him
right now.
Now, mister, I don't know
what got under your scent,
but if you will sit
for a spell
and have a drink...
Ha! I ain't drinkin'
with no rattlesnake like you.
Well, well, well,
Horace.
Is that you?
There's the one
that done it.
You... You tell him
to stay back, Shannon.
This bushwhacker
jumped my claim.
On your orders.
And I can prove it.
Least-wise I could, but...
Now, mister,
those are mighty strong words.
Maybe if you'll just
sit a spell,
we can work this out.
Or you can just say
adios, Horace.
Ah! Unh!
D-Did I do that?
I am so sorry.
I just got this thing, and have
no idea what to do with it.
My apologies again.
Shake the man's hand.
Arly Lyons.
Pleasure, I'm sure.
I-I don't know
who are, mister,
but thank you kindly.
I don't know whether to shake
your hand or shoot you.
That old fool might come back
someday and bushwhack me.
Got a feelin' you'll be
seein' him first.
Excuse me.
Dad, look at that.
It'll be fine.
Well, you'd be
Jedediah Shepard.
I'm Matt Elden.
Matt Elden, I'd like to
introduce you
to my daughter Rebekah.
Well, it's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.
I'm afraid that
your desk is rather...
Ellis Potter must not be
as neat as I remembered.
Sir, Ellis Potter
was murdered six weeks ago.
L... I assumed you knew.
Murdered?
I thought Ellis Potter
was retiring.
I knew him back in Virginia.
Well, he was to retire
this week,
but I'm afraid
he didn't make it.
Jedediah! Is that you?
Mrs. Potter!
Rebekah Shepard!
Oh, darling!
My, how you have grown!
Mary, I just found out
about Ellis.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, thanks, Jed.
It was bad business.
Not that there's any chance
of corrallin' the varmints
that did it!
Now, Mary, you know
that is not fair!
This town
has its hands full.
Oh, it has its hands full,
sure.
Just not ladylike
to speculate what!
Kirby Scott. Just the man.
Matt Elden,
Kirby Scott.
Looks like he may be
our first customer.
I'm afraid Union Army
is not too popular
in these parts, Mr. Scott.
Well, I best rustle up
some new duds
before I'm shot, huh?
Mary, can I arrange
for you to get a ride home?
It's not too safe for a woman
traveling alone these days.
Oh, Dad,
I can go with her.
That way I'll be able
to see the countryside.
I-I'm afraid you don't
understand what I meant.
I'll see to it
you get home, ma'am.
And I will make sure that Miss
Shepard returns safely as well.
Fine idea.
That'll give me a chance
to track down Rachel
and rustle up some land
to show you.
Does that sit well
with you, Mary?
Right down
to the ground, Jed.
Mr. Scott,
come help me find my buggy.
Why, Miss Rebekah.
I was just comin'
to visit with you.
Oh, were you now?
Well, I was just wondering
if I could have the pleasure
of your company
at supper this evening.
Well, I'm afraid
your brother invited me
to accompany him
out to Miss Potter's.
I mean,
I'll be back in time.
I'll wait up, even if
it's way past my bedtime.
Whoa!
Well, hello, little brother.
You lost already?
I'm found, big brother.
I am found.
So there's another Mr. Scott.
Better and better.
Don't worry, young man.
You'll have her all to yourself
on the way back.
Tashi'ne.
Lives with her older sister
in a played out mine
near the lake.
Just the two of them?
Three.
Her older sister married
Willie Brax
when he mustered out
of the Third Colorado
after Sand Creek.
Bad business.
Lot of folks say
he deserted.
But I know better.
Not a yellow bone
in his body.
Rebekah told me
that you and your brother
came out here together.
Was he in Mr. Lincoln's
army as well?
Uh, we didn't exactly
come out together, Miss Potter.
And, no, he didn't exactly
join the regular army.
Surely he didn't join
John Brown's men
or Quantrell's?
No, ma'am.
Uh, Chance sort of
sat on the sidelines,
if you know what I mean.
It was a hard war
to choose sides.
Didn't you have
a brother in the war?
Well, my brother Roy.
Evil bastard.
Pardon my language.
Rode with
"Bloody" Bill Anderson.
Left his granddaughter
for me to raise.
I dread the day
when he comes back.
What became
of your husband Ellis?
Ellis was a mining man
all his life...
from Pennsylvania.
Me being from Virginia, well,
we couldn't agree about nothin'
when the war came.
He put a lot of store
in Mr. Lincoln.
And most of the folks I knew
thought Abe was as dumb
as a post.
God rest his soul.
And when we came west,
Ellis ran the assay office
when the mines were open.
After the Homestead Act in '63,
it was just natural for him
to move on over
to the land office.
They couldn't get
a single man
from back east
'cause of the war.
The last few months, though,
Ellis was actin'
very strange.
Excited and afraid.
My husband was not
a brave man, Kirby.
But he was honest.
Are you sayin'
my father's in danger?
I'd sure as hell say it.
Shoot!
Sarah!
You'll say nothin'
of the sort!
L... This is my daughter, Sarah.
Quite an alarmist,
as you can see.
Sarah. My name's Kirby Scott.
This is Miss Shepard.
Please to make
your acquaintance.
And this is Roy's
granddaughter Kathleen.
Say hi, baby.
Kathleen.
Perhaps we should be going.
Oh, no, please.
Won't you stay
for dinner, please?
Please.
Well, we have
so few folks here,
and we have plenty of food.
Not today, Mrs. Potter.
But I'd like very much
to visit you
later this week,
if you'll allow me.
Well, that just sounds grand.
I'm gonna hold you to it.
You can bank on it.
Don't look so worried,
Miss.
You heard that girl.
How can I not?
You know how excitable
women can be.
So you're an expert
on women, are you?
Oh, no. That's more
my brother's department.
Wait till he meets
my sister.
You must be Jedediah Shepard.
I am.
Excuse all the noise
around here,
but I'm having the place
spruced up a mite
on account
of the big onslaught.
Onslaught?
War's over, man.
Last coupla years,
you coulda fired Jeb Stewart's
cannon through town
and hit nothin' but birds.
Next coupla weeks,
half the town's population
is comin' back.
I suppose you're correct.
Suppose?
Your land office
and my saloon
will be the two top businesses
within 50 miles.
So put a smile
on that face of yours.
I'm lookin'
for a young woman.
Of course you are.
Forgive my poor manners.
Amanda!
We got ourselves here
a young fella
rode darn near 1,500 miles,
and we ain't yet offered him
a fine drink
or a nasty woman.
Right here,
Mr. Land Agent.
Clint, my best bottle
for the land agent here.
Right here we have
our very, very best.
Excuse me, boys.
Dad.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad...
Dad!
Don't get near me.
Dad...
Rachel.
Why are you dressed like that?
Let's not get into this,
Rebekah.
Shut up!
Where's that Virginia charm,
carpetbagger?
Come on, Chance.
Show us that legendary
American know-how.
You know, you could
just pay for it.
Afraid I'd quickly
become a poor man.
Told you things
would get exciting.
I don't think the law would
help on either side. Do you?
Job's still yours
if you want it.
A wise man knows
when to mind his own business.
We'll see.
Thank you for meeting me
this evening.
It was a very kind offer.
I've been called a lot
of things, ma'am,
but kind ain't one of 'em.
Well, you are.
Here's to kindness.
And to kind women.
Like my sister.
My pa didn't approve
of my life either, Rebekah.
Said I was too wild.
Too foolish.
Didn't care about
the important things.
Mucking stalls
and slapping hogs?
And duty, honor, country.
Well, your father may not
have approved of you
not joining the army,
but I do.
War's foolishness.
What does it prove?
A man's worth, maybe?
Poppycock.
This war was an excuse
for Mr. Abraham Lincoln
and his Yankee profiteering
friends, who were trying to...
To free the slaves?
You and Father.
You think Rachel was furious
when her husband Ben
went back to fight?
I imagine so.
Furious women
do foolish things.
Well, you should take this wine
from me, Mr. Gambler.
I'm about to make
some foolish choices of my own.
Cabin should be
just over there.
This grassland
would be yours too.
Right up to that hillside.
Kinda fills the eye,
don't it?
Great place
to raise a family.
If a fella was so inclined.
If a fella was so inclined.
Sorry, son.
It looks worse than I had hoped.
Might be better off
to tear it down
and start over again.
It's not so bad,
Mr. Shepard.
Looks solid enough to me.
Mighty pretty at sunset.
My daughter's taken
quite a shine to you, son.
I suppose you know that.
I don't know
about that, sir.
I kinda figure she liked
my brother better,
if you want to know
the truth.
Fella like Chance
looks might enticing
to a girl at first.
But a man like you,
and a place like this,
looks better to me.
Ain't you maybe gettin'
the plough
a bit ahead of the mule, sir?
I know my daughter,
son.
And I know men.
You want this place,
it's yours.
But if you want my daughter,
you're gonna have to
go after her.
Mr. Elden thought
you wanted to see me.
He was mistaken.
Rebekah, I'm your sister.
Ah.
I'm sorry I wasn't there
after Mom passed, Bekie.
I was...
Otherwise engaged?
Look, I know you don't
approve of me.
But you weren't here
after Ben died.
I had no other way.
No easier way.
Please don't judge me, Bek.
Can't we just go back to...
We can't go back,
Rachel!
Today and tomorrow
is all we have.
But the War...
Is over! It's over!
People keep blaming the war,
and I am sick of it.
We can't walk away
from what it's done to us,
between us!
You can walk away
from what you're doin'.
You could come work here.
Here?
You gotta be kiddin', honey.
I could never work here.
Never.
Never.
Didn't bury the hatchet,
I see.
Can't you see it stickin'
in my back?
Rebekah, this was
a very tough town
to live in during the war.
You think livin'
in Virginia was easy?
Half the families
for Lincoln.
The other half
were for Lee.
Our house was taken over
three times
as battle headquarters.
Once for the North,
twice for the South.
We lost everything.
Everything.
I'm sorry.
Hm?
Let it out.
I promised myself
I wouldn't do that.
That's a tough promise
to keep.
You said
this was a tough town.
So have you worked
for the bank long?
Not too long.
Used to have a ranch
just west of town.
Beef contracts
with the Union Army.
Easy work when the Army
was just fighting the Indians.
Not too popular when we
started fighting each other.
Lots of Confederate
sympathizers hereabouts,
as you can imagine.
Silver strike drew folks
from all over the South.
Owning a bank, you didn't
have to choose sides.
No.
Just have to lend money.
That's popular with everybody.
Uh!
Tashi'ne!
What the hell
are you doin' here?
Sir, my name's
Kirby Scott.
Oh, I know you, blue belly.
And I said get out!
Quiet!
I worked with mongrels
like you too long.
The smell of you
makes me sick.
Get a poultice on that.
Otherwise,
she'll lose her foot.
Best not let us
see you again.
Hello, stranger.
Lost?
Time shall tell.
You're not gonna offer me
a glass of lemonade?
You pass by
any lemon trees?
No.
But if a man expects visitors,
he ought to be prepared.
Canteen's on the post.
Chance says you plan to stay
on this land to prove up.
What's it look like?
You could be goin' door-to-door
fixin' windows.
Like General Sherman
in reverse.
Chance says before the war...
Spendin' a lot of time
with my brother, are you?
Why, Kirby.
You're not jealous?
Not in the least.
Oh!
I, uh... thanks.
You're... welcome.
Well, well.
Must be visitin' day.
Chance know you're out here?
That's none of your affair.
And I'll take it kindly
if you don't make it so.
Ooh! Yes, ma'am.
How may I be of service
to you gentlemen?
Contraire, my Yankee friend.
It is we who may be
of service to you.
How's that?
Mr. Shannon and I heard
an ugly rumor.
Sheriff offered you
that deputy job.
And the more we thought
about it...
The more we realized
that I was much better qualified
for the job.
What about it, Lieutenant?
Our information got
any meat on the bone?
You see, Rufus?
What'd I tell you?
I'm a farmer, McSween.
My father
was a farmer.
I came out here
to get away from guns.
You want the job?
It's yours.
Humble is the man
who knows his limitations.
Mr. Shannon has a long memory,
Sodbuster.
He remembers when a fella
does him a good turn.
And he remembers
when they don't.
Funny.
I'm the same way.
I thought you might
take that job.
I was hoping
maybe to...
No.
You'd be in town.
We could see each other
more often.
Is that what it takes
to win your affection, Miss?
Just be around?
I don't like your tone.
Perhaps I don't like you.
Rebekah...
I came 1,000 miles to prove up
on 160 acres of land.
I expect to work
very hard at it.
I did not come
to pick up a gun.
I'll not see men fall
due to my hand.
But back at the stagecoach, you
and your brother were the best...
Best what?
Gunslingers? Killers?
Don't take much of a man
to do that.
What do you know
about being a man
if you're gonna let
that murderer
be the Deputy Sheriff?
No. Oh, it's fine when you're
defending a strongbox.
Oh, that's just
fine and dandy.
Wasn't money I was
protecting, Bekie.
Well!
A man who is
as good as his word.
What is the world coming to?
Evening, Mrs. Potter.
I was just heading over
to Mr. Brax's place
with some laudanum,
and I figured I'd just see
if you folks needed anything.
Well, just the pleasure
of your company for dinner.
Mary has gone into town
for the mail and some supplies,
but she'll be back directly.
I couldn't impose.
Now, I am not
gonna hear another word.
Kathleen'll bring
more wood in,
and I'm gonna get
the pies in the oven!
All right, Mrs. Potter.
It'd be my pleasure.
Spell you a mite?
Looks like you could
use a hand.
You know, I could use
some practice with that axe
since I got no one special
to do my choppin' for me.
I got it.
Better?
JT.
Thank you
for moseying over.
Grab a chair
and sit for a spell.
What do you need, Del?
Oh.
Not "What do I want?"
But "What do I need?"
You always was a man
of the carefully turned
phrase, Sheriff.
I got work to do,
if you don't mind.
Ho! I know you're busy.
Shinin' your badge,
polishing your boots.
See you, Del.
Oh!
Don't rush off, Sheriff.
I was just wantin' to,
well...
Well, actually,
Ollie and I,
we was just wantin'
to jaw with you for a bit...
about, well,
how busy...
you really are.
Mrs. Potter?
It's my Uncle Roy.
He's come back
for Kathleen.
This day, this day.
I knew it would happen.
Is there anything
I can do?
Kirby, would you be
really upset
if we postpone our supper
to another time?
Not at all,
Mrs. Potter.
Thank you.
I can show you out
this way.
Oh, God!
Please be careful
at the Brax place, Mr. Scott.
William's not a bad man,
but he's jumpy.
What with the war just over.
Shannon's men always tryin'
to run him off.
I'll be careful.
You sure there's nothing
I can do?
There's not much
any of us can do.
Kathleen's his
granddaughter.
It was only a matter of time
before he came back for her.
My uncle Roy is an evil man,
Mr. Scott.
I don't mind sayin' so.
And there's just only so much
evil in this world
a body can withstand.
Where's the bartender?
He got in Chickamauga, Reb.
We want whiskey. And none
of that chilipicker stuff.
It's the last of it.
Right here.
We're willin' to pay.
There ain't enough money
in creation.
Keep the change.
I told you I didn't want
to see you again.
I have laudanum and medicine.
Otherwise, she'll lose
that foot.
I brought you
some medicine.
It might hurt a bit.
That should feel better
in a minute.
Kir-by.
Kirby.
Brax!
I have a warrant
for you to vacate the premises.
Effective noon tomorrow.
What warrant?
This is hogwash.
It's the law, old timer.
You abandoned this claim
when you joined the army.
I was servin' my country.
Well, you shoulda
thought of that
before you became
so patriotic.
Now, do you obey the law...
or do we end this
right here?
Mr. Brax needs time
to think it over.
If I was you,
I'd do the same.
Well, hello, Sodbuster.
I thought we gave you
your chance.
I'm returning the favor.
Nothing's changed.
Noon tomorrow.
I don't owe you nothin'.
Didn't ask for nothin'.
I wore the same uniform as you
for half a decade.
And I wore it with pride.
Lord God willin', l...
I shoulda burned it.
Six months ago,
around November of '64,
Black Kettle
come to Fort Lyon.
Said the sky had been dark
since the war began.
Major Wyncoop
promised him protection.
Settled in a bend
near Sand Creek.
Taste of blood's like liquor
for an ambitious man.
'Fore sun up on the 29th,
we reached the edge of camp,
full of whiskey
to keep out the night air.
Reckon I heard
about that.
Black Kettle had
an American flag
tied to the end
of a long pole.
When he saw us, he ordered
the women and children
to stand under the flag
so we'd be sure to see it.
And there's a real, live breeze
blowin' that mornin'.
I remember smellin'
the buffalo meat.
Seasoned up just right,
you know?
Like, melt in your mouth.
Mm.
I turned see
Colonel Chivington
off to my flank,
and I saw his lips move.
Couldn't make out what
he was sayin' at first.
He was always real quiet.
And then I could.
"No prisoners."
Satan himself never saw
nothin' like it.
After it was over,
I saw Rahi'ne and her sister
walkin' around in the smoke.
I was on the search party
to help kill the survivors.
You couldn't see five feet
through the dust and smoke.
I reckon I got separated
from the rest.
I just reached down
off my horse
and put her and her sister
aboard and took off.
Six months,
and I never looked back.
If you need me for anything,
Mr. Brax...
I'm right over the ridge.
Hold it, Brax.
You were warned.
Now get on your knees,
old timer.
Unh!
Any last words of wisdom
before you depart?
Let them go.
They've done nothin' to you.
They're here with you, old man.
That's enough.
May you and Shannon
rot in hell.
At least you'll
be there first.
Ehh!
Let's get outta here!
How you holdin' up?
Cut myself shavin'...
worse than this.
Hya! Hya! Hya!
I told you I needed help,
Scott.
Don't come bellyachin' to me
just 'cause I can't
be every place at once.
She's lost everyone
that matters to her.
I know that.
I know that!
Miss, is there anything
I can do?
Where the hell were you
this morning?
At the livery stable.
Gettin' ready to ride out
and serve them
eviction warrants on Brax.
Why?
Anybody vouch for that?
You don't ask the questions
around here, Sodbuster.
I do.
How could you have...
Because you didn't
want the job.
Or was I misinformed?
No.
You were not misinformed.
Kirby.
Thank you.
Lemme see about getting
you a room at the hotel.
No.
Go home.
That wouldn't be
a good idea.
Funeral. Of course.
Kirby.
I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.
Tashi'ne, this is Rebekah.
Rebekah.
That's right.
Go with Rebekah, and I'll make
arrangements for the funeral.
I need to go check
with Mr. Elden.
Well, wasn't that
much ado?
Who told you to serve
a warrant on Brax last night?
Who do you think?
Lyons, you're either
workin' for me
or you're workin' for Del.
You pull a stunt
like that again,
you'll be eatin'
that badge for breakfast.
Yes, sir.
Look into what happened
this morning.
I'd better not find
you were involved.
No, sir.
And Lyons,
the next time those boots
wind up on my desk
it'll be because
I just brought 'em back
from the undertaker.
What's the matter
with you?
Nothin' a bullet won't fix.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Shepard around?
Mr. Scott,
pleasure to see you.
No, uh, Jed's showing
a claim,
but I have your papers,
young man.
Signed, filed,
and ready for your signature.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Whoa, I'd actually
completely...
Forgotten?
Son, the paperwork's
just as important as the land.
Maybe more.
Let's get it done.
Mm-hmm.
You sign here...
and here and here.
I was wonderin' what you might
be able to tell me
about the land under
Mr. Brax's claim,
and Mrs. Potter's as well.
Not much.
Nothing special,
I can assure you.
Brax's mine played out
years before he went
off to war.
Ellis and Mary Potter's piece
abuts the Brax claim,
but there was never
much silver on it.
The vein runs, um,
north along
the picket wire,
and, um, Ellis's piece
runs due south.
Here, I, um...
See for yourself.
This is the original
Colorado Mining Company survey.
You can see
where it peters out.
There's no chance
of any vein discovered?
Discovered by who?
The real action's out west,
Mr. Scott.
The Comstock claim
in Virginia City,
not to mention California.
Then why drive
Mr. Brax off his claim?
It's the law, Mr. Scott.
I signed the papers myself.
He abandoned his claim
when he went to war.
And there are
plenty of people
coming west
now that the war is over.
We gotta make room
for them.
Doesn't quite seem fair.
This cabin you're living in
was built by someone too,
Mr. Scott.
But he had the misfortune
of dying at Vicksburg
instead of at home
in his own bed.
Instead of at home
in his own bed.
His wife and adopted daughter
were not of the Christian faith.
Tashi'ne asked that her sister
and Emil Brax,
be buried here today,
as he himself
was a Christian man.
This is dreadful.
I thought we left
all of this behind us.
Some people say
that Emil Brax,
in recent days,
had been a coward.
He died a hero,
defending his family.
The end of the war has
given honorable men
on both sides of this
recent conflict hope.
Hope that we could put
the evil of slavery behind us,
and hope that we could be
one nation under God,
and hope that we can finally
turn our back on evil.
Never turn your back on evil.
Who are you?
John Boone,
U.S. Marshall.
You'd be Kirby Scott.
JT said I'd find you
out here.
That's right.
This is
Miss Rebekah Shepard.
Land agent's daughter.
I don't understand.
I thought the sheriff
was the law.
I'm a Federal Marshall, Miss.
I cover the whole territory.
I understand you had a chance
to become JT's deputy.
You turned it down.
I came west
for different reasons.
I went to dental school, Scott.
Fate is what happens when
need collides with opportunity.
I don't need to be a lawman.
Well, who cares
what you need?
What about what she needed?
Are you content to mop up
after the damage is done?
Hell, a stable boy
could do that.
This is none
of my business.
Evil is all of our business.
Let us pray.
Sheriff! Sheriff!
Father told me to tell you
there's some men
ridin' this way.
Will you look at that?
That's "Bloody" Bill Anderson's
outfit, isn't it?
What's left of 'em.
Who are they?
Marauders from
Kansas, Missouri.
Hell of a reputation.
Worse than Quantrell,
some say.
What do they want?
I don't know.
If that fella in the lead's
who I think he is...
I'm afraid I do.
You comin'?
Or you got
some moonlight plowin' to do?
Yeah.
But I got a better idea.
Then don't play fair.
Play to win!
Just sit.
Amanda.
You're hoardin'
the prettiest girls.
Perhaps it airs
better over here.
Don't mean you need
both of 'em.
I have a hard time
makin' up my mind.
Reckon I can help you out
on that score.
Let's have some order
around here!
Who the hell are you?
He's a tin star, Lester.
Y'all blind?
You challenging my authority?
Lester?
No.
But I think he might.
Pretty tough
with this gun.
How are you
without it?
Fair.
I'm gonna cut you real bad.
Chance.
Wouldn't advise that,
honey.
Mm!
# Wish I was in the land
of cotton #
# Old times there #
# Are not forgotten #
# Look away #
# Look away
Look away #
# Dixieland # #
Dixieland.
Well, it's a coupla
fellow travelers.
You, uh...
You heard we lost the war.
No! You hear that?
He's fibbin'.
Oh, he don't look
like he's fibbin'.
Nope!
Robert E. Lee turned over
his sword
to General Ulysses S. Grant
at Appomattox Courthouse
on April 9th.
A day that will live
in infamy!
To Robert E. Lee!
Robert E. Lee!
Ooh-hoo.
Well, that was not
good sportsmanship.
I'm the law.
Now I want you
to holster your weapons,
and we'll come around
and collect 'em.
Nobody's been bad hurt yet,
and nobody has to be.
You shouldn't have
oughta done this.
I know who you are, Mister.
You aren't wanted for anything
in this territory,
but for what you animals
done back in Kansas,
they oughta string the whole
lot of you up by the balls.
It was war.
That wasn't war.
It was slaughter!
Uh-uh-uh.
I would hate for this thing
to go off
and expose your shortcomings.
I believe, if I recall,
the war is over.
So why don't you just
call it an evening?
Fair enough.
You men are not wanted here.
But I understand
from Mr. Scott
that your boss has got
personal business in the area.
When that's settled,
I want you all
outta here for good.
I'm keeping your weapons
at the sheriff's office
until you leave.
Roy!
Where is she?
Well, you can't find her.
Hello, Sarah.
I'd hoped you died
in the war, Roy.
I'm quite certain you did.
She didn't mean that, Roy.
No?
She... we...
I came for my granddaughter.
She is happy here with me, Roy.
Why don't you just
let her be?
Where's Ellis?
He passed away last month.
Going back east, then?
What business is that
of yours?
Kathleen's not cut out
for that.
What life can you offer her,
Roy?
On the run?
Going to leave her
stranded in some town
where they decide to hang you?
Just let her be, Roy,
please.
Have her here
tomorrow at noon.
Or I'll kill you both.
Just move into the hotel
till they leave town, son.
Oh, that's hardly
necessary, Sheriff.
I can handle things.
Like you did tonight?
Figure I'll get my gear.
I'll be back
at first light.
I'll make arrangements
with Mother Smalley's
You did a good job tonight.
Both of you.
Come on,
my big brother and I
have some serious talking
to do.
You saved my hide tonight,
Sodbuster.
Don't make
a habit of it.
I wasn't planning on it.
Kirby, I'm so proud of you.
Rachel and Chance
want to celebrate.
Why not?
You're welcome to come,
if you'd like.
Reckon I'd see you
at sun-up.
Till morning then.
Hee-yah!
So Sergeant Rabbit,
you really volunteering
for this mission?
It ain't much.
Lonely life.
Well, duty calls, Sergeant.
Call's for thee.
Chance should probably be
out there with them.
So?
He makes me nervous.
Why don't you just hide
your watch?
Yah.
We used to tie Rosie
up to a tree
We used to tie Rosie
up to a tree
and pretend she was Comanche.
Went to supper once,
and couldn't recollect
where we lashed her up.
Ma nearly strung us up
at the smokehouse.
As usual, Chance parlayed
his way out of it.
Our way out of it.
You do charm all.
Every day the sun shines.
What happened
to your sister Rose?
She died of Typhus
before the war.
Ma passed from consumption
before Pa was killed
at Chickamauga.
Sorry.
No brothers of your own?
No. Just me and Beck.
Till I met Ben.
You recollect how you meet
someone and you just...
have to have them?
Apple brown betty?
Oh, I'd die for some.
Rebekah was the best cook
in Tyler County.
Won county fair
five years running.
That I can believe.
Kirby here
won best sweet corn, best sow,
and best natural born hay seed
in 50 miles.
Thanks.
You know I ain't lying,
big brother.
Which is why this...
don't figure at all.
That's not something
I hanker for.
Then don't do it.
You don't owe
that stupid Marshall nothing.
Rachel, this is supposed
to be a celebration.
Why not celebrate him telling
that no good lawman
to shove it up his...
You're drunk!
So?
It's what Shannon pays me for,
ain't it?
Among other things.
You got no call
to say that!
We each walk
our own paths.
Tell that
to Miss High and Mighty.
Rachel.
Rachel!
I'll make sure
she gets home.
You coming?
I think
I'll stay a while.
I'd think on this
long and hard, Kirby.
You threaten me now too,
little brother?
You doing Shannon's
scut work?
That's what he's got
McSweens and Lyons for.
I just deal poker.
And give advice.
Good advice.
Chance just doesn't want you
getting involved in anything...
Move it inside, Sodbuster,
we break her neck.
Come on.
Hold him, boys.
Let the lady go.
Lady? Lady?
Sodbuster.
If she's anything like
her sister, she ain't a lady.
I guarantee it.
You are the lowest form...
Get up, get up!
What do you think, Honey?
This is a better show
than the Del Star, huh?
Don't even water the booze.
Get up, get up!
Hold him, boys!
Hold him, boys.
Oh, you're fired up
now, huh?
Let go of me!
I saved your life today.
That you did.
That you did.
And I thank you for it.
But you saw something
you shouldn't have seen,
Sodbuster.
That's me.
And there's only room for
one lawman in this town.
No!
And I reckon even JT
don't have no use
for a lawman
with just one eye!
Where are the dusters
and the hoods?
You're a little underdressed.
Mr. Shannon ain't gonna be
too happy about this.
You ain't gonna be
too fond of it either.
Chance!
Ta'shine, no.
This was in Lyons' saddlebag?
Took it off myself.
See this jagged tear?
So what?
I saw that same jagged edge
the night the stage
was held up.
Come with me.
Was I involved?
You ought to be
arresting your man
for murdering my top hand.
Or should I get John Boone
to do it?
No, come off it, Del.
Boone'd tell you
to go to hell,
just like I would.
We both know Lyons was filth.
The question is,
were you behind it?
In on robbing
my own payroll?
Why the hell would I do
something like that?
I don't know.
That's why I always figured
you weren't involved.
Well, don't stop now.
Lyons wasn't running
Mr. Brax Office Property
in his own authority.
You put him up to it.
Is that right?
Now, you been around
how long?
About a week?
And all of a sudden,
you are a range detective?
Leave Mr. Shannon alone, Kirby.
Since when is this
your business?
It seems your brother
wants to take over
Mr. Lyons' position
in my organization.
I don't believe you.
I told you I came out west
to find my fortune, Kirby.
Mr. Shannon's gonna
help me find it.
This is about Rebekah,
isn't it?
Leave my sister's name
out of this, you stupid cowboy.
Or do you think
your brother's just with me
'cause he can't have
what he really wants?
That's not what I meant, Rachel.
Get outta here.
I said get outta here!
He's a good man, Del.
Boone and I best not find
you're behind this.
You won't.
Is that because
you're innocent?
Or just because you figure
we're not up to it?
Take your pick, Sheriff.
Take your pick.
Go now, whoa! Ho.
JT?
Guess what? We made it.
No robbery.
First time in six weeks.
Well, that's great, Johnny.
Got the mail too.
Here you go.
Folks are gonna be
mighty hungry for it.
Thank God.
Maybe we'll finally have
that letter from Mother.
Here you go, Violet.
This is addressed
to Mr. Ellis Potter
at the mining office.
Looks like our curse is broken.
You best give it
to that new fella.
Shepard is his name.
Yes, sir.
I'll see to it right away.
Let's go.
Yah!
Mail and payroll got through.
No problem.
Looks like
you may have been right.
Telegraph arrived
for Marshall Boone.
War department's
gonna issue warrants
for Hobbs and his men.
You don't look like
that's good news.
Miss Sarah says that Roy
wants to take Kathleen today.
Well, Boone's on the way
with the warrants.
Ain't much we can do
till then.
I could take 'em up to my place
till Marshall gets here.
Well, reckon you could at that.
I'll take that, Violet.
But driver says to give it
to Mr. Jed.
I always handle the mail,
Violet, you know that.
Yes, sir.
But he said.
That's okay, Matt.
I'll take it.
What with the robberies,
this is the first mail
we've had in six weeks.
That so?
Why don't you let me
take care of that, Jed?
Ellis always liked me
to handle the mail.
That's okay, I'll get to it
in a moment.
Griff?
How would a couple
of your hound hoots here
like to make themselves
some traveling money?
Why, hello, Miss Rebekah.
I was wondering if there was
someplace we could go to talk.
You didn't tell me
you were bringing lunch.
Well, the way
to a man's heart...
is to be honest.
Though cooking never hurts.
Chance, about last night...
There's nothing
to explain.
You made your choice
and I made mine.
What do you mean?
Me and Rachel.
Didn't you already know?
Chance, you can't
be with Rachel.
You sound like Kirby.
Why can't the two of you
just accept
Rachel's the love
of my life?
Love?
I should hardly think so.
Okay.
So it ain't love.
She's just great
in the sack.
Hey, girlie.
Ain't you supposed to be
picking cotton?
Or are you too busy
taking jobs away
from good white folk?
Or sashaying around town
pretending you're good as us?
Y'all leave me alone.
Or my pappy'll come to town
and whip you good.
Let me go! Uh!
Expecting your pappy's
a lot more used to
the other end of this whip.
My pappy
wasn't no slave.
Wasn't ever no slave.
He's a free man.
What'd he do?
Sell your brother and sister?
Or leap off the ship
and keep running.
See here, you men.
Let her go.
Will you look at
the fancy Yankee.
Come to free the slaves like
your skinny-ass Abe Lincoln.
You remember what happened
to him last month, don't you?
Got what he deserved.
Mr. John Booth, Yankee.
Patriot.
John Booth was
a despicable coward.
That make us cowards too,
Yankee?
If the boot fits, wear it.
Jed! Mr. JT!
Sheriff!
Help. Sheriff.
Mr. JT!
You men stop this.
Let her go.
Let her go!
Where'd you men
get those weapons?
Oh, these?
Reckon we got 'em
from your old friends
down at the saloon.
Or maybe they weren't
your friends after all.
They don't like you very much
down there, Sheriff.
You men hand over those weapons
before somebody gets hurt.
Someone. Someone like you.
Maybe we'd better let it go.
Let it go?
Not till you apologize, Yankee.
Not till you crawl over here
and lick the dirt
off my boot.
Clear out of here, Mr. Shepard.
You can't take us all, lawman.
You see what you're missing?
I don't know
what I ever saw in you.
Miss Rebekah!
Miss Rebekah.
Your father's hurt bad.
You need to come quick.
Dad.
Dad!
Daddy?
JT?
JT, stay in the buggy.
Rebekah. Rebekah!
We gotta get these men
to my office.
Rebekah, what...
Where were you?
Where were you?
Ladies, please hush up.
We got two men here
threatenin' their death.
Now, if you're gonna stay here,
you gotta help me.
What do you want
us to do?
Whoa.
Where's Kathleen?
We hid her last night
in the old smokehouse.
She's probably still inside.
Where's Kathleen?
I'll handle the rest.
Roy, please!
Let Kathleen go.
Sarah and I promise,
we'll do anything you want.
You had your chance last night,
woman.
Roy, please.
You had to go to the law.
You deserve to hang!
If so,
you're gonna miss it.
Let's get this jerk
down the well.
I ain't too fond
of sticking around.
Oh!
You are a filthy, rotten
human being, Roy!
I hear Ellis
calling you home.
What are their chances,
Doctor?
Most men back shot
like this'd be dead by now.
But your father's in
fairly decent physical shape.
And that helps, believe me.
And JT here is tougher
than rawhide.
What does that mean,
back shot?
Well, the bullet enters the back
and there's a small hole,
and comes out in front.
I thought they were
in a gunfight.
There's no telling
about a gunfight, Ma'am.
Especially in this town.
My God.
Who did this?
Those men who came in
last night...
No, please.
Those men will be gone soon.
Are they gonna make it, Doc?
It's like drawing
to an inside straight.
Who's winning?
Reckon it ain't you.
You know about this
in advance?
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend?
I've got myself
one hell of an alibi.
I didn't ask you if you did it.
Did you know about it?
No.
Leave him alone.
That's your own father,
Miss Rachel.
My father's been sticking his
nose in other people's business.
Saving a young black woman's
life.
Ain't that how we all
got into this?
On the nose, brother Chance.
You Yankees could just not leave
well enough alone.
Everybody was happy.
Everybody knew their place.
I got nothing against
the negroes.
They's as good
as three-fifths of a person
as you gonna find.
I just don't want 'em voting
or owning businesses.
Or mixing where
they don't belong.
War's over, Greg.
You lost.
How naive are you, friend?
That argument is gonna last
Maybe it's time to go,
little brother?
Are you saying that
I've gotta pick a side?
Uh-uh.
I like it right here.
You wasting your air, Griff.
Kirby here has never
mastered the art
of saying the right thing.
Big brother has to actually
go and do the right thing.
Nearly got the boy killed
in Chancellorsville.
And Vicksburg.
Hmm, perhaps today
is his lucky day.
Keep the faith, Rebekah.
You stick your head outside,
you son of a bitch,
I'll blow her head off.
Hello, Mr. Elden.
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.
Of course, son.
Take a seat.
How's Jedediah?
He's not doing too good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Seemed like a good man.
Yes, sir.
It's part of what almost
got him killed.
Ah, yes.
The young lady.
That's bad.
I'm hoping you might
clear something up for me.
Be glad to.
I'd like to take another look
at that mineral plot
you showed me yesterday.
Of course.
Here you go.
This...
is the mining plot for my deed.
If you notice,
the legend on your map
is upside-down.
I see.
Which means that
this silver vein
is actually running south
through Mr. Brax's claim.
Across into Ellis Potter's
and into my own.
Now, if we're dead
or run off our land,
these claims revert back
to your bank, Mr. Elden.
And to you.
Well, isn't that something?
I know you didn't do it
alone, Mr. Elden.
Del Shannon and Lyons
were in on it with you.
Did Shannon
kill Ellis Potter?
Or did you?
I'm afraid that was Del's doing.
You see, Ellis discovered the
government's error one night.
A lot of mistakes were made
in Washington during the war.
The emphasis was on war maps.
And as to the rest of it...
Well...
The stage holdups weren't
for the money at all.
It was just to stop the mail.
Keep the sheriff
and the land agent
from getting those new maps.
At least until Mr. Brax
was dead
and Mr. Potter was back
in Virginia.
Which leaves only you,
Mr. Scott.
You ever kill anybody,
Mr. Elden?
Can't say that I have.
It's not that easy.
Ooh, I think I'll get
the hang of it.
Deputy, are you in there?
Come out and we'll
go easy on you.
Looks like we got a gift
for you, Deputy.
Come out and we'll let her go.
Don't, Kirby.
They'll kill us both!
I'm a man of my word, Deputy.
Show yourself,
and she'll be okay.
Let her go.
You go to hell!
Let her go.
He's the one we want.
Let her go.
Let her go.
Please stop.
Please, there's been
enough killing.
There ain't never
enough killing.
Kirby.
Get inside the saloon.
No.
Please. With Chance.
Go. Go.
Chance, you have to do
something.
Kirby made his bed.
And he'll lie in it alone.
Please, somebody do something.
Please!
Make your move, Deputy.
Or Roy Hobbs'll
make it for you.
Get in here.
Are you crazy?
Time to face the music, Roy.
Only music's gonna be playing
over your grave, Deputy.
Nobody outguns Roy Hobbs,
Sodbuster.
Your time will come.
But not today.
Kirby!
Mr. Shannon, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to come with me.
With you?
Hell, you're half dead.
You were behind all of this.
Mr. Brax's death,
the mining claims,
the stage holdups.
Now, even if all that
were true,
all your witnesses are dead.
Son, you got any idea how many
guns I got here against you?
Nice to see you boys again.
Why don't you count
your blessings
and get the hell
outta here?
I oughta warn you, Del.
Kirby ain't half bad
with his left hand either.
I'm arresting you for
the attempted murder
of both the Sheriff
and Mr. Jedediah Shepard.
You're loco, son.
Half the town saw
them four Rebs gun them down.
They were back shot.
And I bet I don't need
to look too far
to find some witnesses.
I saw him.
Shut up.
They waited
until the fight started.
And then Griff here opened fire
on JT and the new land agent.
I'm gonna have to
dock your pay for that.
You know, your brother can be
a real pain in the ass.
Men, y'all know
how many of our close friends
and associates
were sent to their reward
by Mr. Scott here.
A year's salary
to the first man
who sends Mr. Scott
to his.
You can't do this.
The whole town will know.
I built this town!
And no Yankee, Reb,
or lawman, or war, for that
matter's, gonna take this
away from me!
Let's go, Shannon.
You too, Griff.
Clint?
I believe it's your deal.
Kirby!
Chance!
Step away from him.
No.
Step away from him!
No. It's over.
I'll be the judge of that.
Boone.
Stay out of this, old man.
Time we settled old scores, Del.
Why not?
Wipe the slate clean.
My thoughts exactly.
Time to go, folks.
Ready, Mr. Scott?
As I'll ever be.
Everything in order, Jed?
Tashi'ne here
is the rightful owner
of Brax's land.
And Kirby gets those
under his land as well.
Looks like when that arm heals,
you may be a wealthy man.
I've got all I need right here.
Am I missing the double wedding?
Not yet.
Right now Chance and I
want to see
what's a little further west.
Not much for settling down.
That's more Kirby's style.
We'll see.
You gonna stick around
and be a deputy, Mr. Scott?
I reckon I could help out
once in a while.
If I'm not in the way.
I'll be sure that he does.
I'm glad to hear it.
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever.
Someday maybe you'll be
after my job.
I think I'll stick
a little closer to home.
I'll see you folks
in the by-and-by.
Light's getting yellow, Chance.
Bye, big brother.
Don't be a stranger.
Oh, we'll be back.
Besides, you're gonna be
a rich man.
Can't play poker
with the dead.
I'm gonna miss them.
A lot.
Go with God, brother.
Go with God.
