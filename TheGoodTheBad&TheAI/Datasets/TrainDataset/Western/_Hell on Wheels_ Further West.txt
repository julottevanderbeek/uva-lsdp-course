I will enjoy taking your railroad from you.
***
I could easily provide
you with over 800 workers.
Perhaps you could use a
former Union Pacific man
to accompany your fresh mormon workers.
This is me cousin,
"Dandy" Johnny Shea.
I can't think about going back,
I'm better off here.
- What is it, Bohannon?
- I quit

We are on the verge of taking that mountain,
thanks to you and your steam shovel.
You can't quit now. I-I-I-I won't allow it!
Railroad's your dream.
Cullen...
What happened to Ruth?
You gave her every chance
to walk away from her deed.
No, it ain't about what I gave her.
She threw her life away on an empty ideal.
Is that what you want?
I'm going home, doc.
Home?
This is your home.
Listen to me.
In the not too distant future,
this railroad will be finished.
I will be back in New York,
and I will need someone
I can trust out here.
You got Delaney. He's a good engineer.
Delaney.
Delaney is not half the man you are.
Might be more if you treat him right.
I don't think you understand
what I've done for you.
What... what I'm offering you.
What your family needs from you.
I won't take you back.
Not again.
Yeah, I know it.
I asked Mr. Delaney make sure
that boiler don't run dry.
It do, we'll be pickin'
iron out our ass 'til Christmas.
You make sure you get to
the top of that Mountain, Psalms.
You make sure you make it to
where you goin' too, Mr. Bohannon.
Yep.
Hello?
Anyone here?
Father Hatch?
Whoa.
Go! Get outta here!
Skit!
Go!
Elder Moss.
Wh-what happened?
Huh? Where is everybody?
Where is everybody? Where is everybody?
Na-o-mi...
Naomi, yeah.
Yeah, where is she? Where's Naomi?
Huh? Where's Naomi?
Elder Moss?
Elder Moss?
Elder Moss!
It appears you've ruffled feathers,
miss Ellison.
I will not be intimidated, Mr. Campbell.
Get out.
I didn't come here to rehash, Louise.
I came here to talk about the future.
Our future.
I intend to purchase  from Durant,
but only if you agree to stay.
And this is my sugar?
Territory status is upon us.
A territory needs a press.
Voice of progress.
A national voice.
I plan to give it to you.
Along with my full protection.
We'll rebuild this newspaper together.
How incredibly generous.
You accept my offer, then?
No. I reject it absolutely.
But I would like to thank you.
For days, I've been feeling useless, futile.
I was losing the sense that
my profession even mattered,
that my... newspaper mattered.
But obviously, it does.
I will never let you take it from me.
Need a room and a bath.
A barber if you got one.
If you'll sign in.
Yeah.
Cullen Bohannon.
I thought that ragged
countenance bore a resemblance.
You, sir, have come a long way for nothing.
Yeah? How's that?
Pestilential grasshopper has brought plague
to this city that has left
a lack of circulating currency
and a surplus of laborers.
I have made a deal with
brigham young for 800 men.
Haven't left a hirable
worker within 500 Miles.
- You stable yourselves?
- Yes, sir.
I got one horse.
My spies tell me that Durant
is cresting Sherman Peak.
He is.
And that his new steam engine
shovel was your invention.
It was.
They tell me something else, too.
That you quit the U.P.
Is that true?
Well, I am curious.
What brings you to this mecca
of polygamist pretension?
Searching for my wife and my boy.
Think they might be here.
She's mormon.
Excuse me.
Mr. Bohannon.
Brigham young is rumored
to have a bed 7 feet long
by 96 feet wide to accommodate his 55 wives.
I do hope yours is not found among 'em.
You know what the wagons cost.
My brother broke it down to the red cent.
He does the figuring.
It's a fair price.
The figures don't tell all, Mr. Spinoza.
When you get your damn fill of starin',
let us know if we got a deal.
You are speaking with God's high minister.
Profanity will not do.
Brother Gundersen.
'Course, uh, you used your own horses,
that's a savings.
Do not negotiate with the man, Zeke.
He's God's whatsit.
Just like last time, Mr. Young.
The numbers is what they are.
And what they are is too high,
my benighted friend.
Lower your price
if you wish to transport
our mormon workmen West.
What I wish for is for fair profit.
I have consulted and prayed...
And here is what I will pay.
You can get your damn wagons somewhere else.
Zeke.
Leave the door open, brother Gundersen.
To release the polluting vapors.
I take it the price would have been lower
had we not been mormons.
Mm. Hmm.
Michael.
Mick.
Ha.
The bleedin' cavalry's comin'.
- What's he want, then?
- Ah, no matter.
I've taken on twice these
with nothin' but a barstool and water back.
Mr. Mayor.
From president-elect Grant,
received within the hour.
Acknowledging the basic judicial
system I have established here,
authorizing the creation of a legislature
and the removal of the
"provisional" from my title.
Fancy words.
You and your men will leave Cheyenne.
And what if we don't have a mind to?
You'll be taken into custody and shot.
On what charges and by whom?
Conspiracy and attempted assassination
of a government official...
And by me.
- Like hell.
-
Good news.
There's a train leaving tomorrow morning.
You'd best be on it.
This here's a credit ledger for the fort.
It's got written down the
names of every family member
who lived there.
Any survivors in it would have come here.
- You don't know that.
- They need brigham young's
permission to settle elsewheres,
and we both know that.
I can't help you, gentile.
Excuse me.
You'd have a record of where they went,
and that's all I'm asking for.
Sir, you're not allowed in here.
Shit, son. I ain't allowed anywheres.
Church records are a
sacred trust and obligation
brought forth by Joseph Smith himself,
kept by the church for its members.
Well, I am a mormon.
Was.
My wife is.
Please.
Fort Smith, Wyoming territory?
Yes, sir.
What...
No, hey! Ow!
It wasn't an Indian attack that killed them.
Fort Smith was hit by smallpox.
Small... smallpox?
The survivors arrived two weeks ago.
Most of them are sick and dying.
They've been quarantined.
How... how many survivors?
Not many.
Oh, uh... Looking for my family.
My, uh, wife and boy.
They were at Fort Smith.
Name's Bohannon.
I'm not seeing anyone with that name.
Naomi and William?
Uh... Hatch?
Might be under.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Mist... Mr. Bohannon!
Mr. Bohannon, please.
There.
Last bed.
I thought she'd be gone by now...
But perhaps she was waiting for you?
H-hold still.
I know it hurts.
Been three girls hurt this month.
Cut, noses broke up.
Same man?
No. Whole bunch of 'em.
Dead rabbits, they go by.
Fix these bandages in the morning.
Will I still be pretty when this heals up?
Shouldn't be bad, you care for it.
Your girls are getting hurt
and cut up by customers.
What business is that of yours?
Well, the girls come to me, is all.
- They ain't being looked after.
- I'm leaving Cheyenne.
I'm taking 'em with me,
so you won't have to worry about it.
- Taking 'em where?
- West.
Cheyenne's been hard on everyone.
Don't mean you run.
Campbell gave me a choice.
I chose me life.
Fine. I'll come with you.
You don't even know where we're going.
Them girls need caring for, Mickey.
I-I'll see to 'em, tend to 'em,
and keep 'em in line.
Make you madam, you mean?
Partner.
You need money to buy into a partnership.
I got money.
I reckon this'll buy me 15%.
But you say what's right.
Assuming it's money I
need to partner with ya.
Peek-a-boo, hot dang...
Oh, there you go.
Oh, yeah.
What do you want, carrot snapper?
Ah.
Uhh...
Huh?
Huh?
That's it.
Shh.
You find the good stuff, Harry?
He did.
Oh. A bottle missing...
- Where's Harry?
- You will read here,
the arrangement as much as
brother Brigham proposed.
Impossible...
You are pleased, brother?
Have the money released.
Good.
Because, if I may...
Go ahead.
I am most happy to have been able,
in my small way,
to forward Heavenly Father's work,
and it is my hope...
I am bold, now, I know...
You can see what I have done here.
The impossible, you have said. Mm.
You realize what I could accomplish there,
among our workers on the Central Pacific?
You wish to join huntington?
Is that it?
I have answered you once.
I join no one.
I am your servant,
and the Lord's.
Never Huntington's.
There as here,
I look after our interest
and the souls of our mormon Brethren.
You see now
how I might be effective?
You...
Yeah.
I come for Naomi...
And William.
Are they alive?
Where are they?
I prayed... He'd take me...
Not them.
I prayed...
Where are they, mother Hatch?
West...
Where you'll never find them.
Away from you.
I'll stay with you, mother Hatch.
I'll watch you die.
I'll make sure they burn you good.
When I find Naomi,
I'll tell her you were miserable to the end.
When my son grows old enough
to know his grandparents...
I will make sure he never hears your name.
Mr. Bohannon?
Mr. Bohannon?
Rest easy, brother Bohannon.
She died peaceful, knowing you were here.
You listen to me.
She was a vengeful woman.
She died the same.
Mr. Bohannon.
Good-bye, sir.
I'm just leaving for California.
Did you find your family?
Searched high and low.
They ain't here.
Well, sir,
you have the visage of a
man who could use a drink.
Searched high and low for that too.
Ain't here.
Well, then it is fortuitous
that you have run into me.
Come along, sir.
Let us imbibe in our comfort.
Come in, why don't you?
The Cheyenne Palace is mine.
The Comfort House is mine.
Jailhouse across the street...
Mine.
The hotel...
Will be mine, one way or another.
Now, that leaves
just one outstanding item.
Which is?
Chicken Hill.
Accept my offer of fair market value
or surrender it to the U.S. Cavalry,
who will bivouac there
until permanent barracks
can be constructed.
You want Chicken Hill?
Take it.
There's the deed.
Now, if you can take it off my desk,
it's yours.
-
- Aah!
Ow!
How 'bout that?
Ow!
Oh!
- Uh...
- Ah!
Should we intervene, major?
Only if guns come out.
Okay... I'll give you...
Double fair market value.
Triple.
Done.
There are many problems I can't solve,
Mr. Bohannon.
But locating whiskey in this
sober place is not one of 'em.
It's called Valley Tan,
made from... Imported fire and brimstone.
Now, looking for your wife and son...
That's an ambitious undertaking,
especially for an ambitious
man like yourself.
But I'm curious, how do you begin?
Where do you start looking?
I only started here.
Now I'm heading west.
Mm-hmm.
The mormon faithful...
Are 80,000 strong,
covering almost as many miles.
It seems to me that your plan,
"Head west,"
is guaranteed to do only one thing, hmm?
Fail.
That begs the question
how badly do you really
want to find your family?
Thank you for the drink.
But I prefer rotgut.
If rotgut is all that you have had,
rotgut is all you prefer.
Central Pacific could expand
your preferences, Mr. Bohannon.
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Bohannon,
there is a better way to find your family.
If you will indulge me.
I plan to drive my road
right into the heart of mormon country,
from California all the
way to salt lake city.
There is nothing that will
happen in mormon country
that I w't know about
or can't find out about.
Now, if you work for me,
all of my resources will
be at your disposal.
Your family's out there, we'll find 'em.
How's that sound?
Sounds like I'd be back to
working on the railroad.
I've dug that ditch.
There's a difference between digging a ditch
and owning it, sir.
Now, we will find your family,
if that's what you really want to do,
but this time, for the first time,
you'll have something to
show them for all your work,
more than a canvas tent and a mud floor.
I'm prepared to offer you a
small interest in my company.
How does that sound?
The day draws a shade
pulls the thread of
your frayed lace undone
it falls like the
evenings that charm
then devour their young
the face of the moon on the
river will shiver and run
from belief to
surrender and I want you
to lead me on
the quiet of midnight
is bright in the sky
Look alive, girls.
Go on.
As men from the county line get down
and take up their arms
no one you can name is just
that one thing they have shown
you speak from the
shadow and I want you
to lead me on
Beautiful day.
To collis P. Huntington,
director of Central Pacific Railroad.
Stop.
Sherman peak is behind me.
Stop.
I am coming for you.
Stop.
The zebra shall be eaten.
Stop.
Excuse me, I...
Excuse me?
Name?
Cullen Bohannon.
Railroad experience?
More than enough, chan!
More than enough.
Welcome to the great state of California,
Mr. Bohannon.
Ambition get the best of ya?
I'm here 'til I find my family.
Whatever you can do to help me, you'll do.
Whatever's my share, I keep,
whether I'm here a week or a year.
Agreed.
It's a big company.
Come with me! I want to show you a telegram.
Durant is on the downslope of Sherman Peak.
Now... with you in camp,
maybe this is the moment
when the zebra turns tables on the lion.
What say you, Mr. Bohannon?
I say blood will be spilled.
They say everything can be replaced
yet every distance is not near
so I remember every face
of every man who put me here
I see my light come shinin'
from the west unto the east
any day now
any day now
I shall be released
