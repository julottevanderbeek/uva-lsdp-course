- But I'm tired!
- It's the beginning of the day now. Come on.
All right.
You're it.
Forward!
- Mama.!
- You stay with Pa.!
Now hold up.
Dear Ma and Pa.
The Bible says, for everything,
there is a season.
And after two years
of marriage...
the time has finally come
for Willie and me...
to put down roots
on a ranch of our own.
Ho.!
- So long.
- We left the wagon train today...
and are heading out alone through
desolate and beautiful country.
It's not green like the farm.
More golden.
As you can tell by my handwriting,
the way is pretty bumpy.
Willie's worried we got
a late start leaving Denver.
August is not a good month
to start up a ranch.
I did get a full year of teaching in,
and we can use the money.
We also may be starting up
something else.
Namely,your first grandchild.
I haven't told Willie yet.
He's got so much
on his mind already.
There will be plenty of time
to tell him after we've settled.
For everything,
there is a season.
Willie, can you pull up
for a minute?
Feel better?
Yes.
You're bound to get sick
pitching around in that wagon.
There's still a couple of hours left
of daylight. We can keep going if you want.
Nah, that's okay.
We'll get an early start in the morning.
Come on. I'll help you
get supper started.
Looks like they're alone, Trent.
Just out for a little romantic ride in the country.
Shouldn't we do a roundabout,
make sure they ain't part of a wagon train?
I'm tired.
What I'd like'd
be a hot bath...
a bottle of whiskey
and a woman.
- Well, one out of three ain't bad.
- What do you say?
Enough talk.
Let's make me rich today.
- The sodbuster ties his gun down.
- So do we.
But your average rancher
don't tie his gun down, Mason.
- What do you say, Trent?
- Some other time maybe.
Willie, bring
some forks when you come.
- Welcome, folks.
- Thank you, sir.
Frank Taylor. Proud owner of the greatest
general store in this parts.
Oh, Missie LaHaye.
And this is my husband, Willie.
Pleasure. You folks
just passing through?
- We're figuring on staying.
- Well, that's good news to Texford Junction.
Well, if you could just show us
the land offices, Mr. Taylorson.
Yes, sir.
About two doors down.
Good-bye.
This is the track you'll be homesteading.
Just north of McClain Place.
See? There's the main creek
threading through the middle...
with plenty of branches
for the cattle to water.
It's a good place to start a family.
Here's the deed.
I wish you folks
the very best of luck.
Many come. Not many last.
- We'll last.
- With hard work and a lot of prayer.
What are you doing?
Next to marrying you,
this is the happiest day of my life.
- Our life.
- Missie LaHaye...
as God as my witness,
I swear to work harder...
than any man to build you
a home on this land.
And we'll raise a family...
and watch generations after generations
of LaHayes thrive and prosper.
Well, Willie, I have something
to say about that.
- Hey, get back here. Get back here.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I didn't see nothing, mister, honest.
Chicken thieves start early
in these parts.
That's the first child
I've seen.
Yep. Glad you brought
all those books just for that one.
I'm sure there are more.
First the ranch.
Then teaching.
- Then everything else.
- Everything else?
You know what I mean. What were you gonna
tell me before that chicken butted in?
Just that, uh-
that I'm happy too, Willie.
- Hello, young man.
- Howdy.
I'm Missie LaHaye.
What's your name?
-Jeff Huff, ma'am.
- How old are you,Jeff Huff?
- Twelve years old, ma'am.
- Did you catch that chicken?
No. Got distracted
by your smooching.
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I'm sorry we caused you
to lose your chicken.
Oh. Weren't mine, anyway.
Just fooling around.
- Willie.
- Sonny! Sonny!
Where you been? I been waiting
so long for you to come back.
Where have you been?
Sonny? Where you been, Sonny?
"Where you been, Sonny?''
- Ow.
- Leave him be. I mean it.
I'm just having a little fun
with your little brother, Sonny.
Take it easy, Mason.
Why don't you and I
go in and have a drink?
Sonny...
you can go play.
- Don't go embarrassing me like that!
- Sorry, Sonny.
Got you something.
Easy there,Jeff. Don't that widow feed you?
I pay her good money.
I don't like it there, Sonny.
I wanna go with you.
Yeah, well, you can't.
I told you that
a hundred times.
Whoa.
I'll build you a house
a lot better than that one.
Oh, no. Willie,
this house is just fine.
Let's go take a look.
Humble as it may be, sweetheart, this is
the first home of our own that we've ever had.
- No stove.
- I can use the fireplace.
My cooking can't get
any worse than it is right now.
Lord, bless this house
and all who enter.
Amen.
Dearest family,
I miss you and the small creature comforts.
Sometimes I can almost hear
your voices in the soft prairie wind.
I worry about Willie.
He works with a ferocity
that sometimes scares me.
He's so concerned
we won't be ready for winter.
I've still not found the right time
to tell him about the baby.
Willie and I went riding
over our land.
What a beautiful country
the Lord has made.
Just the other day,
we saw Indians on our ridgeline.
Willie is very concerned
for my safety...
though there hasn't been any Indian attacks
in years in these parts.
Willie and I are sending you a treasure map
to our hard-earned savings...
which wejust buried in
the wilds of our new ranch.
I certainly hope
you never need to use it.
Willie doesn't trust
banks out here.
But then, this is
a strange and wild place.
I've been punching cattle
over three years, Mr. LaHaye.
I'm not as experienced as some,
but more than others.
- Where you hail from, Henry?
- What does that matter? I'm here now.
All right.
I suppose it's none
of my business anyway.
- No offense.
- None taken...
if... you give me a job.
How.
Uh, I'm Missie LaHaye.
My husband and I,
uh, homestead this place.
We raise, uh, cattle.
This "how", what is
that supposed to mean?
You speak English?
That's what they tell me.
I'm Miriam Red Hawk McClain.
Married to Sean McClain?
We homestead the next tract
to the south of here.
- Oh, we're neighbors.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.
Oh!
Please. Please come in.
- I don't understand, mister-
-Just Scottie's fine.
Been cowboying
since I was a kid.
I've done everything
there is to do.
How come you haven't been hired
by one of the big outfits?
I can't use this no more,
so most people think I'm washed up.
But I learned
to get by with my left.
You take me on, Mr. LaHaye,
and I won't let you down.
You got yourself a job.
Uh, I'm just getting started.
Trying to make this place into a home.
Please, sit.
I think I have one lastjar
of strawberry preserves...
that I've been saving
for just such an occasion.
Please, here.
Now, this here is a county fair
blue ribbon winner.
Mm. Mm.
This is very good. You must teach me
how to make this.
Oh, my mother made it.
I'm not a very good cook.
When I was growing up,
I mostly helped out my pa-
riding horses, plowing the field,
tending to the chickens.
Then you will do
very well here.
Many women who come here
are soft.
They don't know how to do
these things. You do.
Still, I feel that my husband
would prefer a good meal.
I brought you some things.
It is too late to start a garden this year,
so corn, potatoes, beets.
- Oh, thank you, Miriam.
- We are neighbors.
The last family was here, well,
they could have asked us for more help...
but... I think
they feared my Shoshone ways.
Oh, well, my husband and I will be grateful
for whatever help we can get.
Um, what is in there?
- The secret to flaky biscuits.
- Pig lard.
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.
- What do you think about these?
- You could breed 'em.
- Would you be Mr. LaHaye?
- I would.
Well, I'm Fyn Anders.
I would like job, sir, if please.
Uh, what kind of foreigner
is you, son?
I come from Norway on boat...
to find adventure
in the big, wide open spaces.
Well, you have any experience
around cattle?
No, sir. But I am big,
strong. Own horse.
Well, Fyn Anders from Norway,
this'll be strictly trial basis.
- Hope you learn fast.
- Don't worry, Mr. LaHaye.
I learn good and fast.
You betcha.
- What do you think?
- Probably 40 or 50-
Good cow.
The boys will love the jam.
And so will their pa.
Sure I can't give you
any biscuits.
No.
Thank you, though.
Well, maybe next time
I'll make them with the pig lard.
If I don't retch.
When you're ready to bring this little one
into the world, I will be there.
- I've delivered many babies.
- Oh, Miriam, thank you!
- I'll bring some books for the boys.
- Good.
I don't want them growing up
illiterate like their pa.
Very nice to meet you,
neighbor.
You too.
Here comes trouble.
I, uh, heard you were
hiring some cowpokes.
Jobs are filled.
Oh, this is the bunch
you hired.
You're really scratching
the bottom of the barrel.
Too bad you just couldn't have waited
a bit, hired some real men.
Just where would I find
these real men?
Me.
Me and my boys.
Not only can we rope
and ride...
but most important,
we can shoot.
Hey, mister. I bet you can't
shoot worth nothing.
Why don't I start with you?
Trent, come on.
Let's get out of here.
Well, we got some cows to drive,
so watch them, and do likewise.
You betcha, boss.
Mr. LaHaye.
How would you feel about hiring
on another broke-down old cowboy?
Well, I suppose I wouldn't feel
so good about that, mister-
- My name is Cookie.
- You're a cook.
You're real quick.
Afraid I can't afford
another hand right now.
Strictly on a trial basis.
Come on! Get up there!
Get it up there!
Move it now! Ha!
It's a beautiful herd,
Willie.
Move it.! Come on. Move it.!
This- This way. Come on.
Hyah.! Hyah.! Come on.!
This way. Hyah!
How do, Miss LaHaye?
My dearest Missie,
the prospect of being grandparents...
fills us
with such joy and pride.
I can only imagine
how happy you must be.
And by now, I'm sure you've shared the happy
news with that hard-working son-in-law of mine.
I can still remember
the exact moment...
when your mother
told me about you.
I was standing in the kitchen
eating breakfast...
and most of all, I remember how radiant
your mother looked when she told me.
And as for you, my strong daughter,
I hope you are feeling well...
and that it is
an easy pregnancy for you.
I love you, darling.
My wife and my initials.
Fine idea, including her.
All this would be nothing
without her.
Therefore, a man shall leave his father
and mother and cleave to his wife.
They shall be as one.
Genesis.
You know your Bible.
Yes. Yes, good reading material.
Anyway, I'm happy for you.
A good marriage, that's...
something to be treasured.
Speaking from experience?
- Scottie!
- What?
- Ready for another one?
- Notjust yet.
Hold on.
Where you off to?
I'm taking some books
to our neighbors, the McClains.
Be back in a couple
of hours.
She sure is
a better rider than I am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Buffalo.
It ain't done
by white men neither.
White men
only take the pelt.
Injuns usejust
about everything-
the hide, the meat, the horns,
some of the bones.
Yeah, Missie and I saw some Indians
riding south last week.
All this beef is better than
this buffalo meat any day.
There ain't been Injun trouble
in these parts for quite a while.
Let's tell the boys.
Lord, give this horse
wings to fly. Hyah!
- Fyn.
Go spell Scottie. There's some sick cows
that need to be brought in.
- Yes, boss.
- Mrs. LaHaye in the house?
No, sir. She up and took some books
over to your neighbors...
- the McClains.
Boy, she sure can ride.
Miriam!
You are safe here,
Mrs. LaHaye.
- I'm so sorry.
You're putting a scare
into this poor woman.
We were just having
a little fun.
You listen to Sharp Claw!
Is it trouble
you want for us?
My apologies, Mrs. LaHaye.
Missie, this is
my brother, Sharp Claw.
I give you my word, Mrs. LaHaye,
my young hunters meant no harm...
except to laugh
at your expense.
Their proper behavior
when they saw you...
should have been to make sure
that you arrived at your destination safely.
Especially a woman
in your condition.
Oh.
And this is
my husband Sean.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, madam.
- Nice meeting you.
And Robert and Bruce.
Hello, boys.
Please.
- Can we take our books?
- Yes, they're yours.
Now, children,
these are the same books...
used in almost every school
in America.
Who is this McGuffey?
An Ohio schoolmaster
who felt a burden from God...
to teach all American children
how to read.
- American children?
- Yes, sir. And that includes those...
whom our late President Lincoln
called Native American.
Thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.
Now, you all have your books.
All you men
and children out.
We have women's business
to talk about.
Yes.
Sharp Claw!
Over there.
Someone's coming.
Willie.
This is Miriam...
and her husband, Sean,
and her brother, Sharp Claw.
We're on our way
to the mountains.
We intend only
to take some buffalo.
I have given strict orders that no cattle are
to be harmed, and those orders will be obeyed.
Are you ready to go home, Missie?
Mr. McClain, Mrs. McClain.
Sharp Claw.
- Good-bye. Thank you.
- Good-bye.
Thank you.
- Hold her down.
- Uh-huh.
She'll be good
in a couple of weeks.
- First time I ever seen 'em go on like that.
- Well.
Just what did you think
you were doing, Missie?
I was taking some McGuffey readers
over to the McClains.
Miriam asked me to teach
her children how to read.
How come you never told me
about Miriam's visit?
I'm worried about you
riding alone.
It's too dangerous. You won't
be doing this again, Missie.
- Oh,yes, I will.!
- Oh, no, you won't.
Oh, yes, I will!
Missie. Sweetheart.
Do you miss teaching
this much?
No, that's not why
I'm crying.
Then why?
Because I truly believe...
that the Lord sent
Miriam McClain to us.
And why would he do
a thing like that?
To bring our baby
into the world...
healthy and hardy.
Our baby?
Missie.
Please, Willie, don't worry.
Miriam will be my midwife.
She's delivered all the babies
in her village for many years.
Our baby?
Oh, Willie,
aren't you happy?
I'm the happiest man alive.
Good grub, Cookie.
- Very good.
- Perfect for a brisk night like this.
Here's a blanket
to keep off the cold.
Don't give her
that old horse blanket.
You, uh-You take mine,
Mrs. LaHaye.
Oh, no. Well, thank you both,
but I'm fine.
You told them?
I'd like to raise
a coffee cup to, uh-
seeing as this is the strongest we got-
to Mr. and Mrs. LaHaye...
and their happy news.
- So say we all.
- Hear! Hear!
Thank you.
Willie.
Hmm?
What is it? I'm awake.
They were just so kind
and concerned tonight.
- The hands?
- Mm-hmm.
Yep.
What about their families?
I really don't know
much about them.
But they're good workers.
And that's the most
important thing.
Shouldn't we know
if they have families or not?
Missie, lots of times...
cowboys come out here
to get away from things.
You gotta respect that.
Still, it seems like
such a lonely life.
- You're gonna be a wonderful mother.
So?
Well, looks like they figured it
all by their lonesome.
Let's make me rich today.
Willie says you know
the good book.
Sunday mornings, my husband
and I read the Bible and pray together.
You're invited tojoin us.
Well, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye,
but, uh, I don't think so.
- Aren't you a churchgoing man?
- Actually, I used to be a preacher.
- A preacher?
- Yeah, well...
the Lord giveth...
and the Lord taketh away.
What did he take away
from you?
Something very special.
My wife.
Fyn. Come here.
- Need you to reshoe this horse.
- Yes, boss.
Morning, Mrs. McClain.
Mr. LaHaye.
- You and Missie going into town today?
- Yes, we are.
Mrs. McClain, I know
when we first met I was-
Out here, neighbors need
one another, Mr. LaHaye.
I couldn't agree more.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Basically,
you just take it up-
You make it look
so easy, Sonny.
Well, practiced lots of hours
to make it look like that.
Okay, come here.
Remember how I showed you.
You coil it in your left hand, like that.
Make sure there ain't no kinks in the line.
This is the noose.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Let's see what you got.
Now loosen your wrist.
When you're ready, cast it off.
Oh, missed again.
That's all right. Keep practicing.
I'll get another rope.
Good day.
I'm Missie LaHaye.
He seems like a nice boy.
My brother.
I'm glad to hear
that he has family.
- I've been a little worried about him.
- He's fine.
And your mother and father?
They're gone.
No offense, ma'am...
but it ain't your business worrying
about someone's not your kin.
It's just Christian charity,
Mr. Huff.
I hope we're not
interrupting you, ma'am.
What do you want, Trent?
I think you'd better
get saddled up.
We got some riding
to do.
Sonny. I did it.
I roped the post.
Gotta go now.
Behave yourself.
Keep practicing.
- You'll be back though.
- You know it.
You got my rope.
Is Sonny gone a lot?
It's his job.
He's making money so we can have
a ranch of our own someday.
He sounds like
a very good brother.
Got yourself a strong breed.
And we'll know more after roundup.
Let's call it a day.
Now, children...
and Mr. McClain...
I want you to write
these letters on your slates...
and then sound them out.
And when you know them...
you'll have mastered
the entire alphabet.
Help each other out now.
The weather's turning cold...
and Sharp Claw and his camp
will be leaving tomorrow...
and you probably shouldn't
get a chill riding over.
So, this is my last class
for a while?
The children have learned
much from you, Mrs. LaHaye.
Keep at it,
Mr. McClain.
Having a turbulent time
finding a word that starts with an ""X.''
That is a difficult letter.
Sean's always
used an "X" to sign his name.
Well, not
for much longer.
Thank you.
Snow'll be coming soon.
Now remember, really sound out
the words with them.
And when you come back, they'll be
ready for the advanced readers.
I'll keep them on it.
Good.
God go with you
and your family, Sharp Claw.
Thank you.
And, Miriam,
I'll be seeing you.
Yes, you will.
Safe travels.
Thank you. Good-bye.
Come on!
Willie and the ranch hands
have worked hard...
to ensure the livestock
survive the long winter.
And that over there
is gonna be all your peas.
Cookie and I have prepared the soil
for a large garden next spring.
I so enjoy his companionship
and his cooking.
Here I just might make
a- a sweet tater patch.
- Oh.
- Have large taters in here.
It's all coming together.
It's beginning
to feel like... home.
Now, as we wait for snow, the ranch hands
have time to go into town...
for some well deserved
relaxation.
- This time I got a better hand-
- Don't tell us what you got.
- How many?
- Three.
As for Willie, he still works
harder than anyone.
Maybe more now,
knowing the baby's coming.
As we prepare for winter...
I'm reminded of Isaiah preparing
the way for our savior's birth...
and I think warmly of all of you
as Christmas approaches.
Are you warm enough?
I'm fine.
Why are you always so warm?
Even your feet.
Well, someone's gotta warm them
icy toes of yours.
I guess that's why
we're a perfect match.
The sky looks like snow.
We're lucky it held off this long.
You know,
I was thinking today...
this is gonna be our first Christmas
in this house, Willie.
I bet you miss your family and all those
family traditions you talk about.
Yeah, sure, I miss them.
But we'll start
new traditions here.
Well, with the weather
settling in...
this might be our last chance
getting to town for a while.
Better tell Santa
what you want for Christmas.
No, nothing store bought.
That would be just a waste of money.
Well, what then?
All I want for Christmas
is to be surrounded...
by the people
we care about.
This here's mine.
No.
You got the watch.
I got the watch...
because mine broke.
It's a practical thing.
I have to know the time...
in order to steal.
Gimme more money.
No.
You got two brooches
and a watch, and I don't got none of that.
You got two salt
and pepper shaker, and, uh-
You ever wish you had
a place to call your own?
More coffee?
Thank you.
Men...
Mrs. LaHaye would
like to say something.
Well, as you all know...
Christmas will be here
before we know it.
Santa Claus will never find us
all the way out here, I bet.
Well, he will if my wife
has anything to say about it.
Willie and I would like to cordially invite
you all to Christmas dinner.
Unless you have
other places to be.
Well, then that settles it.
Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.
Trimmings?
Now, where do you
rustle up some of those?
Well, I was hoping you
might help me, Cookie.
I got that.
Mrs. LaHaye! Mrs. LaHaye!
-Jeff. What is it?
- Mrs. LaHaye, I got something.
- From Sonny.
- What's it say?
Not sure.
Come here.
"Dear little brother,
it's real hot here.
"I'll bring you some beans
that jump all by themselves.
"Stay good, and I'll
see you after Christmas.
Sonny."
Best be going, Missie.
Well, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye.
That boy's got
one speed- runnin'.
By the time this arrives,
I expect it will be nigh onto Christmas.
I think on how long the world
lay in darkness...
before the light of the world
was born in that humble little stable.
We have been blessed
to receive his light.
Not only to live in hope ourselves,
but to take hope to others.
I am sending you something which I know
you'll remember from many Christmases past.
May it start a new tradition
in the LaHaye household...
and remind you
we are there in spirit...
sharing your first
Christmas on the ranch.
And know we will miss you...
but our hearts are forever
knit together in love.
Round. Take it
round there, Henry.
Round. Here.
Here. Fyn.
Come on, Fyn. Hurry up.
I just don't understand why Willie had to
go into town on Christmas Eve.
Oh, I'm sure he'll
be along shortly, ma'am.
Wow.
Willie LaHaye, where have you been?
It's Christmas Eve!
I know.
There's gonna be one more
for Christmas, Missie.
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. LaHaye.
Merry Christmas,Jeff.
Please come in.
Come in.
There's just
one thing missing.
This star
stood on top...
of every Christmas tree
we had when I was growing up.
Go ahead.
Here you go, little man.
Come on.
Oh, that was good.
Mm, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye. This is...
the finest Christmas dinner
I've had in many a year.
Many a year?
It's the best one I ever had.
Well, thank you, but I couldn't have
done it without Cookie.
Well, thank you, ma'am.
Now is it time
to open presents?
Presents?
Yes,Jeff, I think now
it's time to open presents.
All right.
Let's see.
Uh, Fyn.
Scottie.
Henry.
And Je-
Oh, me.
And Cookie.
Here ya go.
Well, go ahead.
Open 'em up.
Oh.
Thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.
This is the best Christmas
I ever had.
Me too.
What is it, Scottie?
This is the...
first Christmas
present I ever got.
Well, gentlemen, I know how you all
feel about Bible reading...
but it wouldn't be
Christmas without it.
So, you are welcome to stay,
but if you want to leave-
I- I believe I'd
like to stay, ma'am.
Yeah, I'd like to stay too.
Me too, ma'am.
Gospel,
according to Luke?
"And so...
"Joseph went up
from Galilee...
"to the city of Nazareth,
to Judaea...
"to be enrolled with Mary,
his betrothed...
"who was with child.
"And while they were there,
the time came for her to be delivered.
"And she gave birth
to her firstborn son.
"And she wrapped him in swaddling clothes,
and laid him in a manger.
"And an angel of the Lord
appeared above them...
"and the glory of the Lord
shone around them...
"and they were
filled with fear.
"And the angel said to them...
"Be not afraid,
for behold...
"I bring you good news
of a greatjoy...
"which will come to
all the people.
"For unto you this day is born,
in the city of David...

who is Christ, the Lord."
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
How.
I've missed you, neighbor.
I missed you too.
Sonny! Sonny!
Oh, now,
isn't that sweet?
Is there nothing good
and decent with you guys?
Hey, Mason, come on.
Let's give them
some privacy.
Oh, well, that's just
real nice of you, Trent.
- Come here.
- How's it goin'?
Oh, I- I really got a lot of stuff
to tell you about.
Um, it's kinda hard
to know where to start.
Read 'em and weep.
I'll go around back
to get that for you.
Now, deal, boys.
As long as the old man
don't blow it.
That's a pair right there.
Mind if I sit in?
Uh, we're just about to leave.
Uh, I'm out.
Oh, come on, Scottie.
Just a few more hands.
I can win it all back.
I feel it.
Uh, let's go, Fyn. You're almost
out of money anyway.
- LaHayes doesn't pay you.
- Well, like all cowboys...
we get paid
when the cattle is sold.
No, no, no.
Mr. LaHaye pay us anyway.
He dig up a tin of
dollar bills just to pay us.
It's like a-
a buried treasure.
Don't listen to him. He's drunk.
Now come on, Fyn!
Just like buried treasure.
Old Henry's going to
Sunday morning meeting.
Well, maybe I should
be going too.
If believin' the way they does
makes them the way they is...
it bides
looking into sometime.
Henry, will you be so kind
as to lead us in prayer?
I don't know, ma'am. I'm-
I'm afraid I'm
out of practice.
Kind of-
Kind ofhard to...
start.
It's okay to stumble.
He's ready to catch you.
Lord, sometimes...
we look
but don't perceive.
Sometimes we listen
but don't understand.
Please, open our ears
and eyes...
to your truth.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
It's open to
everyone on Sunday.
Oh, Fyn. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Please come in.
Sorry, boss.
He got the jump on me.
- What do you want?
- I want your money.
Let's go.
Follow him.
Get up.
Move it out.
Hey, there, come on.!
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Good Sunday morning to y'all.
Sonny?
Jeff, I- I didn't know.
I thought you was in town.
What ya doing?
Ain't this sweet?
All right,
all of you, sit down.
Come on.
You too, kid.
Just do as the man says.
I'll just go over
and get my treasure map.
Leave her alone!
Now...
I missed on purpose,
but I won't do it twice.
Please. You can see
she's expecting.
So am I.
I'm expecting to come back here
with more money than I left with.
I don't know what makes you
think that there's any money.
Well, your Norwegian cowpoke...
has a tendency to run off at the mouth
after a couple of pints.
Showing off his money,
and bragging about...
how his boss has a treasure
buried on his land.
Tie him up.
You do as he says, Missie,
you'll be all right.
You remember where
we dug that hole?
- I think I remember.
- You'll be fine.
All right.
Enough said.
Let's make me rich today.
Hyah.!
Hurry it up.
- I need something to dig with.
- Well, then use your hands.
Make it quick.
Is that it or not?
Well, then toss it over.
You're gonna have to show me where
the rest of the money is.
But y-you have all the money.
There is no more.
No, I don't have
all the money.
'Cause that Norwegian,
he wasn't spending silver.
He was spending cash.
I could just about eat me
a whole side of beef right now.
Well, if you turn me loose,
I'll cook you whatever you want.
- Like rat stew.
- Oh, and now how stupid you think I am?
You're working for Trent,
ain't you?
Equal partners is what we is.
That right, Sonny?
You equal partners
with these lowlifes?
Shut your mouth!
Ooh.
Why don't you tell
your brother, Sonny?
Why don't you tell him what
you do to make money?
Tell him how all you do
is rob innocent people.
Probably been involved
in a murder or two.
That's a lie!
Tell him he's wrong, Sonny.
You ain't never killed nobody.
Tell him, Sonny. Tell-Tell him
you ain't like these other bad men.
I ain't never
killed nobody. Never.
Don't you see?
I'm doing this
for us,Jeff.
Our future. You and me
and the life we're trying to have.
No, Sonny.
You can't mean that.
What would Ma and Pa say
about your thieving ways?
They'd say,
"Good for you, Sonny.
Trying to make a life for
you and your little brother."
So you think...
they're looking down from heaven
right now, and they're proud of you?
Aren't you tired of living
in that boardinghouse?
Huh? No place
that's really yours?
I want a better life
for us,Jeff.
That's why I'm doing this.
These folks are
my friends, Sonny.
Mrs. LaHaye been
teaching me to read.
Mr. LaHaye fetches me for the Sunday
meetings, and he's teaching me ranching.
These are the kind of people things always
work out for. They'll be fine.
We ain't taking nothing from them
they can't get back 1 0 times over.
When this is over, you and me
can spend all the time you want together.
Get it out of there.
Toss it to me.
- You got a key for this?
- No.
Don't you trust
nobody anymore?
Oh, my,
isn't that pretty?
- Whoo-wee.
Put your hands in the air.
You know how to use that?
I missed on purpose.
I won't do it twice.
Shooting a man's
a different story.
A good Christian woman
like yourself wouldn't hurt anyone.
So what you gonna do?
That's two more shots.
Sonny,
I could use a little help here.
This is for your own good.
Look.
Where's the woman, Trent?
What did you do?
Mi-
Where is she?
Go get her! Go find her!
- What are you doing here?
- It's all right,Jeff. I will. I will.
- Get her.
- Jeff,it's all right.
Listen to me.
Listen to me. I will,Jeff.
What'd you do with that girl?
Where is she?
It's all right.
It's all right,Jeff.
It's all right.
Where is she, Trent?
You'd better tell me
she ain't hurt, or so help me.
Stand up slowly.
Drop your gun, Sonny,
or he's dead.
Missie.
- Missie?
- Sonny, go cut Willie loose...
and don't you
so much as nick him.
Find it hard to believe
you got the drop on Trent.
I got his gun
and his dignity.
Missie, pick up the gun,
and move away from him.
Looks like you got me.
Sonny, tie him up.
Just like you did us.
Then maybe we'll ask
the law to spare your life.
Here, let me help you
with that, Sonny.
Sonny!
It's okay.
Just don't go away, Sonny.
Don't go.
Don't go away.
Fix him up, won't ya?
He wouldn't have hurt ya.
Oh, I would fix him if I could.
I knew he wouldn't hurt me.
I'm so sorry for
what I done, ma'am.
Please forgive me.
Don't hold my deeds
against him.
He's got no one now.
He's got nobody.
Oh, no, forgiveness
is yours, Sonny.
He'll be with us now,
I promise.
You grow up to be a man...
that Pa would be proud of,
you hear me,Jeff?
I will.
And you promise me you won't
spend your days missing me.
Ask me no questions...
I'll tell you no lies.
I'll pray for you, Sonny.
Now, don't go wasting
your prayers on me, ma'am.
I done too many bad things
for God to be forgivin'.
Long ago,
there was a thief...
left on a cross to die,
just like you, Sonny.
But then he heard the glorious words
of the Lord about redemption.
And he knew that very day
he was gonna be in paradise.
He's waiting
for you, Sonny.
Go with God.
"Thou anointest my head with oil,
and my cup runneth over.
"Surely, goodness and mercy...
"shall follow me
all the days of my life-
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever."
Amen.
Jeff s part of
our family now.
Yep.
If someday he wants to
take the LaHaye name...
I'd be fine
with that too.
That would
be nice, Willie.
We are gonna need
a bigger house.
I was thinking I could
knock out this back wall...
maybe put in
a bedroom or two.
- Maybe
- Willie.
- Yeah?
- I think maybe you should put your boots back on.
It's time.
But Miriam said we were
still a few weeks away.
No, I think you'd best
be getting Miriam.
Now.
What's the matter?
You're gonna sleep in the bunkhouse
tonight,Jeff,just like a real cowboy.
I'm having the baby.
Maybe I'll go, uh,
check on those cattle.
Okay, sure.
I'll go with you.
Uh, maybe I'll wait
a little bit.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll wait.
It ain't your firstborn
you're worrying about.
Now quit it.
You're making the boss crazy.
It's gotten
awfully quiet in there.
- It's a boy!
Willie.
Come and meet your son.
We never did get around
to deciding what to name him.
I was thinking...
"Matthew."
After your brother.
Matthew Isaiah LaHaye.
Mattie.
It fits.
Shoo. Shoo.
She needs her rest.
It's all right, Miriam.
You can come closer.
Hello.
I remember thinking that day...
we had finally reached
the end of ourjourney.
But now I know that thejourney's
long and lasts a lifetime.
Each day on the ranch,
I am reminded of God's plan...
and the never ending
circle oflife.
Come on.! Hyah.!
I love you.
Bye, Willie.
Your grandsons grow bigger
and stronger each day.
Matthew has your eyes...
- and hopes to see his granddaddy soon.
- Bye, Henry.
Jeffhas thrived, and
Willie and I are very proud...
he has taken
the name of LaHaye.
Bye-bye, Scottie.
You take care, Mrs. LaHaye.
We'll be back pretty soon now.
- See you, Cookie.
- Take care.
Safe travels.
The herd has increased
by another 40 head...
and Willie and the ranch hands
are driving some of them to the market.
Whoa.
Look at this one.
- Oh, wow.
- This is huge.
- Will you bring it in?
- Okay.
The garden has given us a
bounty of vegetables...
to put up
for the winter.
Who knows what
the next year will bring.
I am confident the love of God
and family will light our path.
And a renewed faith
in the words...
"For everything,
there is a season...
and a time for
every matter under heaven."
