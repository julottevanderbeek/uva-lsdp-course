'To the untrained eye, it may
look like another day at school.
'Actually, it was a very special
week.
'Or, in Neil's case, a very special
needs week.'
Bollocks, no way is that right.
You all right, Neil? What are you
playing?
Oh, behave. That's well too hard.
Brain Training?
Stupid thing. Why's that wrong?
What's it say your
brain age is Neil?
I got it up to 12 a minute ago.
Have you caught Downs
syndrome or something?
Has it asked if Santa is real?
Don't listen to them Neil.
He does exist.
Yeah, and he's just sorted out
our Saturday night with the
gift of gash.
Sexy soiree? That sounds sexy.
Fucking hell, is that Louise Graham?
She doesn't normally look like that.
Oh, she'd definitely get it.
Right in the bumhole.
Lucky girl.
This is amazing, we have
been invited to a cool party.
Kind of. I nicked
this out of Sadie Cunningham's bag
in registration.
Thought we should try and go.
Oh, so it's another cool party
we're specifically not invited too?
Good job, Jay.
Erm, isn't there something
else on Saturday anyway?
Don't think so.
It's my birthday.
I'm having a dinner party.
I sent you the invites
a month ago.
Is that really happening?
I thought it was a joke.
It's a joke that we've
got to go to a dinner party
rather than a sex party.
Two things...
One, it won't be a sex party -
it's Louise Graham we're talking
about. Two...
Even if it is you were invited
to my party first.
Just cancel yours, Will, you can
have your birthday any weekend.
Thanks, Neil. Simon you don't want
to go to Louise Graham's do you?
Me? No, god no. No. Not unless you're
going to cancel yours?
I'm not.
Sure. Sure.
Oh, except my French exchange
bloke arrives today
and I'm meant to look after him
all week.
Bring him along.
It'll be nice to have some
sophistication at the party.
I don't know if he's sophisticated.
Some friend of my mum's asked if we'd
have him. He might be a massive twat.
He's the French version of you!
Don't forget you have to bring
a girl.
I'd like it to be a
proper dinner party.
Can I ask your mum? No.
'So, after school we went
to say bonjour to Patrice.'
What's France like then Patrice?
Cool. And are French birds dirty?
Quoi?
He doesn't get any, he's all greasy.
Birds don't go for
that, French or not.
IN FRENCH
Pardon?
I thought you said that.
You'll be OK here
What did he say?
Do you not speak any French?
No. That's why my mum was keen
for him to come over - to teach me a
bit. I've picked up "clope" so far.
What? Cigarette. He smokes.
Simon. You have porn?
Oh, for fuck's sake, I
keep saying... No I don't.
Internet?
No.
You can't get any
porn on the internet?
That's not the internet, Si.
Are you trying to get porn on the
washing machine?
My mum and dad have got a
filter on it. I can't see any.
That's fucking tragic.
What are you, 11?
Yeah, all right, mate.
See you later.
He seems a bit weird. He asked if
I'd tried the "sleeping beauty".
Oh, it's good that. You know it?
Yeah. You sit on your arm
till your hand goes dead.
Ten, fifteen minutes
is normally enough.
When you wank it feels
like someone else is doing it.
How do you know these things?
Everyone knows the
"sleeping beauty", that's old.
Is it?
Yeah, my mate's brother invented it.
He and his mates
used to be called the Dead Hand
Gang.
They had a gang
based on masturbation?
Nothing gay about that
Yeah, well he's in the air
force now so how gay is that?
Still quite gay.
'So, my dinner party guest
list was shaping up nicely.
'Four idiots and a racist
Frenchman.'
It's going to be tricky to get girls
to come to your party.
Because you forgot and it's short
notice?
No, cos Louise
Graham's quite popular.
Most people will be at hers.
Please say you'll at least try to
bring girls.
This birthday can't be as depressing
as last year's.
What, because you got that
briefcase?
No - my father left my mother.
I'll see what Carli's up to.
Not being seen dead with you in a
million years is what!
Oh, I'm sorry, Russell Brand,
who are you bringing again?
Don't worry about me. I'm up to
my neck in sluts at the moment.
Maybe I'll bring my new fuck buddy.
That little barmaid
from the Fox and Hounds.
You've pulled a barmaid? Nice.
Has she got special
dietary requirements?
I've never cooked
for an imaginary woman before.
I know she's not allergic to nuts.
My nuts.
Brilliant. Or my cock.
She only eats small portions?
I didn't hear your mum complaining
although her mouth was full.
Good one
Just drop us off here, Si.
Don't you want a lift to school?
This is close enough.
We don't want to be seen
getting out of this shit heap.
No offence, see you later.
Actually I might get out too.
Fine, see you at school.
Do you want to get in the
front Patrice? No.
Great..
'They say the quickest way to a
man's heart is through his stomach.
'I was hoping it would be a way
into my female guests' knickers.'
What about a chicken casserole?
Why are you even asking? If it was
up to me we'd all have Big Macs.
Did you not see Super Size Me?
Yeah. It just made me
really want a Big Mac.
Oh, shit, Charlotte's online.
You asked her along yet?
No. I don't know if I should.
Go on, it'll be great.
Message her now.
Really, do you think so?
Yeah, it's cool, just say, "Hi".
All right.
Done it.
Oh, wow, she's come straight back.
She says, "Hi, whassup".
Smiley face. Urgh.
Ask her out.
No, can't just jump in, not the
way things have been with us.
Have to charm her a bit first.
I've written "Just hanging out
with Si and his French exchange".
She thinks you're handsome?!
Oh, no. She means Patrice.
Thank god.
Ugh, I'm a div.
Hmm, another smiley face.
Can't bring myself to send
a smiley back,
but I could
write "lol" if I absolutely had to.
Do that.
It's going well, mate, ask her out.
It's going well isn't it?
Definitely.
"It's my birthday.
Come for dinner?"
That pause isn't good.
Calm down, it's only been a second.
She was straight
back every time before.
Holy shit. She's gone offline
rather than answer
whether or not she'll
come to my birthday?
Maybe the connection dropped?
Nope, it was back and forward,
back and forward.
Then a question about
dinner and she's gone.
Brilliant, thanks a bunch
Look, she didn't say, "No"
did she?
No. But she did hang up.
I'm sure she'll be there.
Well, not sure, but y'know.
Oh, hello, Simon. Oh.
Bonjour.
Oh, my goodness, you're French.
This is Patrice, he's my
sort of French exchange,
Patrice this is Will's mum.
Hello.
Well, erm, I'm just
going to play tennis.
Ha, don't know why I mentioned that.
Bye then.
Au revoir, Patrice.
Au revoir.
Your mother is very sexy.
Sorry?
She has the sex.
He's a strange one isn't he?
Yep, but he's French,
they're all weird aren't they?
Oh, god, please don't be racist.
That's not racist, I'm just saying
that he barely says anything
and when he does speak it's always
about sex.
Just like all French people.
The next day was my birthday.
Mum was serving me
up her speciality -
scrambled eggs and disappointment.
Happy birthday, petal. Thanks, Mum.
Here's your present.
It's nothing big because I'm saving
up for something special
next year, when you can drive.
Next year? I can drive this year.
I thought you had to be 18 to drive?
No, it's 17.
Oh, right.
Sorry, your father used to deal
with things like that.
Oh, thanks, Mum. Calvin Klein.
It is...
It's a tight vest top.
Don't you like the colour? Is this
the only present you got me?
What's wrong with it?
When have you ever seen me
wear something like that?
You'll look cool.
All the boy bands wear them.
I'm not in a boy band.
Fine. Fine. I've got a
receipt. You can exchange it.
I'm sorry. I've ruined your big day.
I got it wrong about the driving
and about this.
No, Mum, sorry.
I suppose it's not too bad.
You don't want me to exchange it?
No, I'll wear it.
Tonight?
Errm, not tonight.
You hate it. I'll change it.
No, fine.
I'll definitely wear it tonight.
Patrice spends an awfully long
time in the shower doesn't he?
Yeah, about him. As it's Will's
birthday tonight,
could you look after Patrice?
No, you're meant to be learning from
him, Simon. Anyway we're going out.
Can't you take him with you?
It's a special night out for us.
We don't really need a 17 year old
French boy tagging along.
Things haven't got that
bad in the bedroom yet!
Jesus Christ.
He'll have more fun with you
and the boys.
He doesn't. He just sits around
rolling cigarettes and shrugging.
Must be useful having a handsome
Frenchman in tow to meet the ladies?
He's not handsome.
Patrice is handsome.
Aye aye! I'd better watch it!
Looks like your mother is lining up
a toy boy!
Oh, god.
Chance would be a fine thing.
Oh, not you too.
Remember, gorgeous. What I lack
in energy
I make up for in experience.
Oh, god, you two are disgusting.
Oh, come on, Simon, you used to
look at far worse on the internet.
'Elsewhere on the internet,
the dead hand gang
'was enrolling its latest recruit.'
Jay, Neil's here for you.
What? He's early.
Don't come in, I'm getting changed.
MOANING FROM COMPUTER
Are you OK? It's just a film.
A normal film.
I'm getting changed. Get out.
MOANING CONTINUES
What film's that, then?
Oh, right.
'Whilst I was making my final
preparations, including putting on
'shit music girls would like,
Patrice had been busy too.'
I just had a really nice, er
tug, thinking about your mother.
I think some went on the floor.
Sorry.
Great, thanks, Patrice.
I'll get it. It could be Charlotte.
Well, it's not
going to be Charlotte.
Cheer up, it might be. She's got
the details, you said so yourself.
All right, gays.
'Happy birthday to me.'
'It was 8.30pm on my 17th birthday,
and my party was in full swing.'
Where's your plus one then, Jay?
Not coming. She got a modelling job,
had to fly to Paris.
Barmaid by day, supermodel by night.
Sounds likely.
Where's Little Miss
Stuck-up Cock-tease?
Do you mean Carli?
Yep.
Oh, yeah, I don't
think Carli will make it.
Why not? Is something up?
No, it's nothing like that.
I just sort of didn't
invite her in the end.
You really are a bollockless
little twat, aren't you?
So there are going to
be no women here then?
None at all?
I don't know why I bother.
Well, I wouldn't say
there will be no women...
Yeah, not no women!
So there are some women coming?
Maybe, maybe not.
Look, it's very clear from your
smirking faces and tone of voice
that actually
there are some women coming.
We got you a special birthday treat.
Did you?
Stripper!
What?
Have you really booked a stripper?
Yeah!
She was only 150 quid!
How did you pay for that?
We'll have a whip-round
when she gets here.
A whip-round?
Round who? The five of us?
We don't have 30 quid each!
No, if we all put in... Wait...
Oh, shit, yeah.
Brilliant. So just to confirm,
until an angry stripper turns up,
we are without any female company?
Thanks guys,
this is a great birthday.
If you're gonna cry about it,
I'll get some local snatch in.
What about them birds
we passed outside?
Yeah, they were all right.
Yes, please, drag some random
girls off the street for me
Or we could go to
Louise Graham's party?
Yeah, why aren't we there? It's
got to be better than this shithole.
Thanks very much. More wine?
I bet it's crawling with clunge.
And I bet it's not!
Oh, yeah, and you'd know?
I've put lots of effort into this.
made a really nice coq au vin...
Cock of what?!
You don't help yourself, do you?
Oh, yes, I see.
"coq au vin", very mature.
It actually means chicken in wine,
doesn't it, Patrice?
Quoi?
Well, it does.
And it doesn't mean cock up my arse,
or cock on my head, or...
You got some cock
in the back of a van?
Or that I got
a cock in the back of a van.
Look, all I wanted was a
civilised and sophisticated birthday.
Just something a bit different
from the usual parties,
maybe even the sort of party
that girls are impressed by.
OK, so there aren't any girls here,
but why don't we at least attempt
to have a sophisticated conversation?
I know it's a tall order,
and I'm not expecting sparkling,
but give it a go, eh?
As it is my fucking birthday!
How much Lego
can you stuff up your bum?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Not now, just when you was younger.
How much?
You are grim, mate.
Why were you sticking
Lego up your bum?
Not a lot, just like a
rectangular one and a long one.
< Couple of singles, maybe.
Fine, fine, let's see if those girls
outside want to come join us then.
Yes!
Are you sure, mate? I thought
you wanted this to be special?
Why fight it?
Charlotte's not coming, is she?
And a skilful raconteur like
Neil is wasted on just us.
Nice one. Now I get a proper
three-course meal,
blowie, shag and anal.
'So we headed into the night,
'and found Jay's three courses
sitting on a fence.'
'Allo, 'allo. Here they are.
Nice. >
They look a bit rough.
Are they drinking in the street? >
Dirty.
Not quite the sophisticates I had
in mind, but at least they're female.
You going over then, Jay?
Nah, Si should.
What? Why me?
Alphabetical.
You got that bent look girls go for.
Fine, if you're going to be rude,
you go then.
Sorry for being "rude"
Just go, Si, it's freezing out here.
< Come on, Si. For me, yeah?
For my birthday?
God, all right then.
Hi, there.
What did you fucking say?
Erm, hello.
And what?
Um, I wanted to ask you to a party?
I'm 13.
Oh, right.
And she's 11, you nonce.
Yep, there's been a mistake, so...
Like looking at little girls, do ya?
Like getting them to parties
where you can touch them, do ya?
No, God, no. Look, I'm going now.
< Paedo!
You fucking paedo!
< Yeah, run, you paedo.
Fucking hell, don't do that,
Patrice.
I'm going to get my
fucking brother on you.
< That's it, run away, paedo boy.
Keep going, paedo!
< Keep walking, you fucking paedo!
Nice one, Si.
Me? It was fucking Patrice
who wound them up.
You tried to nonce them up.
I'm not in the mood for this,
just warning you.
"Ooh, watch out, Uncle Simon might
give me a special cuddle."
Oh, fuck.
What's for pudding, Will?
A middle-aged woman demanding
Oh, shit. What are we going to do?
I think we should go...
Yes, fine, I give up. Let's try to
get in to Louise Graham's.
What about your dinner party?
Forget it. You can lead a horse
to water but can't stop it sticking
Lego up its bum.
For Christ's sake,
Patrice, don't do that!
< God, Si, he's a nightmare!
We can't have him scare all the muff
away at the party, let's ditch him.
< I'm looking after him,
I can't leave him stranded
in a strange country.
He comes from a strange country.
Si, for once, Jay is right.
Patrice is weird and boring.
Do you really think girls will be
impressed when we turn up with that?
Probably not.
Let's just leg it while his back
is turned.
It's now or never, Si.
OK, fuck it, come on then.
'So we ran away. Yep, ran away.
'Something I hadn't done since John
Cook discovered wedgies in Year 8.'
I've got a stitch.
That should be enough.
He's behind us!
No way! >
Run!
He's chasing us!
Fucking hell,
he doesn't give up easily, does he?
What does he think is happening?!
I think he's caught us up.
Yeah, good spot, Neil.
Simon, why we run?
Erm, yeah, dunno.
You don't know?
Yeah.
So we stop?
Yeah, probably. Good idea.
Shall we go to that party then?
'So after trying and failing to
outrun a boy in Cuban heels,
'we headed for Louise Graham's party,
'which we definitely wouldn't
get into.'
Who's gonna ask if we can come in?
Will?
I don't even know her!
I stuck chewing gum in her
hair in Year 8.
Great. Anyone else fucked her off?
Out the way you Kwik Shit Shitters,
I'll sort this.
BUZZER
DOOR OPENS
Yeah?
Hello, Louise. I'm Will.
You can't come in,
there's too many already.
Look, we'll be no trouble, I promise.
I mean, look at us.
One of you can come in.
One, five, there's hardly
any difference,
perhaps we could negotiate...
Him.
He can come in. >
Oh, right, well the thing is, Simon
will have to come in, too,
he's supposed to be looking after...
Great.
So we can add Patrice to the growing
list of people more popular than us.
Fucking John's in there!
And he's with a girl!
He's got his hand on her tit!
This is too tragic. >
And Charlotte Big Jugs is in there.
Where?
Right. Time for Plan B.
Oh, right, there's a Plan B,
is there?
Plan A was so brilliantly devised
I wouldn't have thought we'd need
a Plan B!
What is it? Climb over her fence?
It's a bit higher than I imagined.
Don't shit yourself.
It's only a fence, it won't bite.
Yes, Jay, except I'm not worried
about it biting,
I'm worried about breaking my neck.
Come on, it'll be a laugh,
climbing and that.
Will it?
There must be another way.
Ah, it's full of clunge.
Give us a push, Neil.
I'm just not made for climbing.
Maybe one of these panels is loose.
There's a gap here!
Come on, Will. Hurry up!
Oh, please, no!
Why's he always gotta be different?
Just fucking hurry up,
you twat, everyone's looking.
What's going on?
Oh, hi, Louise.
As I was saying, it's quite important
we look after Patrice...
Have you just crawled
through my dog's shit?
Yes, I have. But ask yourself why?
That you've excluded us
from this party
because of some vague rules about
popularity is ridiculous.
Although it looks like we climbed a
fence and crawled through dog shit,
what we've done is challenged
your social apartheid.
You weren't invited
cos I don't know you well.
That makes sense too, I suppose.
God, if you're that desperate
then you can stay.
But take that jacket
off before you go inside.
Sweet, nice one!
She's right about
the jacket though, it stinks.
Oh, mate, that is rank.
It's all up your sleeve, look.
Oh, Christ!
What the fuck is that?
Oh, my God.
It was a present from my mum,
all right?
And you've worn it?
She been getting gift ideas
from Neil's old man?
Oi, my dad's not bent.
Honestly, that is not a good look.
Well, we've just gatecrashed a
party that Big John was invited to,
so none of us are winning
the cool prize.
But you are losing by a mile.
Not for long.
I'm going to find Charlotte.
Upstairs getting fucked,
most likely.
I've told you she's not like that!
I'll check upstairs first, though.
'The best thing about your birthday
'is everyone has to do exactly
what you want.
'With this in mind,
I went to find Charlotte.'
Nice T-shirt
Yeah, good look, briefcase.
Someone's stolen your sleeves.
Yep, nice one.
Where's the rest of Take That?
Retro, but a good one.
Come on! Let me go first,
you know I'm desperate.
Ha-ha! Unlucky.
Don't be a cock!
No, don't.
Seriously, come on, I'm bursting!
Look, come on!
Oh, hi, Jay, are you queuing?
Yeah! I might piss my pants
any minute.
Oh.
Won't be too long,
been in there a while.
Oh, right.
So, didn't know you were
friends with Louise.
Oh, no, we're not,
we climbed the fence. It's cool!
Right.
Carli, hi.
Hi, Simon, how are you?
Good, yeah. OK.
Yeah, pretty awesome.
Jesus Christ, Simon, what the
fuck have you done in there?
What?
Have you been eating cat food again?
Oh, God, you've left skids
down the bowl too.
Carli, I didn't.
I only went in for a piss.
Oh, God, I can taste it.
Jay!
I might go upstairs.
No, don't. It was a wee.
It was only a wee!
I promise I didn't leave skids!
It doesn't smell at all, you fucker,
it was a wee. Why did you do that?
Funny.
'OK, so things weren't going
exactly to plan.
'But if I could just find Charlotte,
'I was confident it would
still be a birthday to remember.
'And I was right.'
Oh, hi, Charlotte, there you are.
Will! Um, could you go away?
Time out, fella!
You're not alone now.
Oh, Patrice...
Salut.
Salut.
Um, are you two...?
Seriously, what are you doing?
I thought we could hang out a bit.
Not right now, maybe.
Will, I don't know why you're doing
this. And what are you wearing?
I've got a bottle of champagne
at home,
and I remembered when we first met we
had champagne, as it's my birthday
I thought maybe...
Is he touching you, now?
Look, maybe we'll
have a drink later.
Yeah, later, course.
Oh, Will?
Could you turn the light off?
No, leave on.
OK.
'Great.
'And I'd rather hoped the singlet
was the worst birthday surprise.
'Meanwhile, my mates were
making the most of finally
getting into a cool party,
'by standing in a corridor,
not talking to anyone.'
All right? Did you find Charlotte?
Um, yeah. Yeah, I did.
Where is she then?
Upstairs being fucked by Patrice.
Knew it.
Ooh, unlucky!
Can you make him stop, please, Simon?
As a birthday present?
Um, not really.
Sorry, that's just too weird.
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.
Shall we go then?
Oh, hi, Mark, I'm just off
but if you were looking
for Charlotte,
I think she's upstairs.
Fuck off, you prick.
Have a fun night!
'So, ironically, it was Donovan who
gave me the best gift this year,
'a savagely beaten French kid.'
What if Donovan kills him?
Good.
Mum'll go mental if
Patrice is hurt.
What's she gonna do,
get you a shitter car?
Fair point.
Fuck him,
you never see him again, so what?
I'm meant to
stay at his at half term.
Do you want to go to France?
Not really.
Well, shut up then.
What about me? It's my birthday
and I saw Patrice trying to mount
Charlotte!
The fucking baguette-eating
dickhead frog.
That's a bit racist.
He's made me racist.
Did you get to see her boobies?
No, Neil.
Funnily enough through my tear-filled
eyes, I couldn't see any tits.
Bad luck.
Oh, God, what if my birthdays just
get worse and worse from now on?
What'll happen next year?
You get AIDS?
I'd have to have sex for that.
Or fuck a monkey.
Technically that still counts.
Or drink from the
same cup as Neil's dad.
Oi, my dad does not have AIDS.
Your dad is so AIDS,
he's the one who gave it to monkeys.
Take that back.
That's what the monkeys said to him.
Come on, mate,
let's get back to yours.
I'll let you beat me at Pro Evo.
I can beat you anyway.
Well, we'll see, won't we?
That's them. Fucking paedos!
Run!
Again? Oh, good
Split up, he can't get us all!
He's got a fucking cricket bat!
Neil, go away!
This is the tin hat.
Worst birthday ever!
'So my birthday, or dog shit,
singlet, heartbreak day,
'as I've come to think of it,
was over.
'It's fair to say it
hadn't been the best.
'But I had learnt
one important life lesson.
'If you go round to Neil's,
don't play with his Lego.'
