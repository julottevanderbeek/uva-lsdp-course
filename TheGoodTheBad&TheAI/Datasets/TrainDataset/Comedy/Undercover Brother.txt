Narrator:
After a generation of struggle
African Americans
entered the '70s
- I am...
- I am...
- somebody!
- "somebody!"
and black culture reached
its high point,
influencing all facets
of American life.
## Say it Iouder... ##
Audience:
## "l'm black and l'm proud" ##
Let me hear you--
## Say it Iouder... ##
But progress slowed
in the decades that followed.
Black culture began to lose
its distinctive flavor.
And as the millennium
drew to a close,
These seemingly random events
were in fact orchestrated
by The Man,
a villain obsessed
with turning back the clock
on race relations.
Just when it seemed
the funky spirit
of the '7 0s
would be lost forever,
a new hero emerged.
His name, Undercover Brother.
## "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"

## "Tear the roof off the sucka" ##
## "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"
"tear the roof off the mothersucka" ##
## "Tear the roof off the sucka" ##
## "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"

## "Tear the roof off the sucka" ##

## "Tear the roof off this sucka" ##

## There's a whoIe Iot
of rhythm going round ##
## Whoa! We want the funk ##
## Give up the funk
Ah, we need the funk... ##
Give it to me.
Need it, got to have it.
- ## We need the funk ##
- We need the funk.
- ## "Gotta have the funk" ##

## "Turn this mother out..." ##
It ain't no thang.
Yeah.
A bird gonna shit
on my windshieId?!
Not on my CadiIIac!
I'm gonna chop your
feathers off
and put you in Chinatown!
They gonna make
Peking Pigeon out of you!
Damn!
Unbeknownst
to Undercover Brother,
there was a secret organization
dedicated to truth,
justice,
and the Afro-American way.
They had never crossed paths
until now.
Headquarters, come in.
Good work, Sistah GirI.
Data from the mainframe
ready to commence.
- She's transmitting!
Are we up and ready?
- Yes, sir.
And I've hacked into
the bank security system.
Computer:
You've got soul.
- We're in.
- "Aha!"
The computer!
Another idea stoIen from the bIack man.
Did you aII know that
George Washington Carver
made the first computer
out of a peanut?
- Hmm?
- A peanut?
- A peanut!
- Shut up and get back to work!
I've spent six months
setting up this operation
and I want
to see everything--
off-shore accounts,
dummy corporations, money Iaundering.
we may finaIIy be abIe
to stop The Man.
Waited a Iong time for this.
- What the heII?
- What the heII?
- What the--
- "Dissed."
- Ah, soIid.
- "Hey!"
What the heII
are you doing, oId man?
- AII: Whoa!
- Headquarters...
- is there another
agent on this case?
- HeII, no!
Damn it, who is that guy?
I'II cross-reference the bank's
security camera with our database.
Guard 1 :
Come on, UncIe Ben!
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
It's Macy Gray
with pork-chop sideburns!
Who's bad?
Ohh! Right up

- Right on, sweet sistah.
Chief:
Damn it, who is he?!

Damn it.
Who was that guy?

Announcer:
Mr. Feather, The Man wants to see you.
FabuIous.
Newscaster:
And now, the Channel 8 News
with Wendy Marshall
There's growing specuIation
that former defense secretary and war
hero,
GeneraI Warren BoutweII,
wiII run for President.
He is considered
the first African-American
with a Iegitimate chance
of winning.
Wendy?
Yeah, he is a strong
candidate, Chuck.
He's so weII-spoken.
I've noticed that.
General Boutwell seems to have
a lot of support all across the nation.
Yes, and not just
in the urban areas.
ln fact, the decorated
four-star general and Vietnam vet
is regarded
as one of the country's
most well-respected
public figures.
GeneraI:
Thank you very much.
A staunch advocate
for civil rights,
Boutwell has never backed down
from controversial issues.
lndeed, if ever
there was a straighter
arrow
than Warren Boutwell,
we'd be hard-pressed
to find him.
WeII, if he does decIare
his candidacy,
this certainIy wiII be
an exciting race.
Race? I'm not
touching that one.
First, our chiIdren hip-hop
aII over the suburbs.
Now Boutwell
might be President?!
They are taking over
every aspect of our culture!
- Don't you agree,
Mr. Feather?
- Word.
- For sheezy, my neezy.
- What did you say?
I said... for sure.
Yes, indeedy.
I have a coId.
l want the White House
to stay white.
EIiminate him!
But, sir,
if we kiII him,
we'II onIy be
making him a hero.
Do you have a better idea?
Our friends
at MuItinationaI Inc.
have been deveIoping
a new drug
with some very
interesting
side effects.
I think we may have found
the perfect guinea pig.
Newscaster:
The so called Afro Bandit
struck Multinational Bank.
However, it appears
no money was stoIen.
Authorities questioned
singer Macy Gray,
but she was reIeased
for Iack of evidence.
WeII, wouId anybody
Iike to expIain exactIy
what the heII happened
at the bank?!
His name
is Undercover Brother.
ApparentIy, he was erasing
mortgage records
so that Iow-income famiIies
wouIdn't Iose their homes.
Sistah GirI:
Great.
A ''SouI Train'' reject
with a Robin Hood compIex.
- Now I've heard everything.
- Hey, hey, hey, now.
At Ieast he got
the job done.
- That's the kind
of man we need around here.
- The keyword being ''man''?
HoId on.
I didn't say that, you did.
Man-man.
The GeneraI's
press conference is starting!
Newscaster:
We interrupt this broadcast to take you live
to a press conference
by GeneraI Warren BoutweII,
in which he is expected
to announce
that he is a candidate
for presidency of the United States.
I wonder if he'II run
as a Democrat or an Independent.
- Never know.
Might be a RepubIican.
- Oh, pIease.
What kind
of seIf-respecting
bIack man
wouId run
as a RepubIican?
Name one thing
the RepubIican party
has done
for bIack peopIe. One!
WeII, they were
the party of LincoIn.
They stood against
the tyranny of oppression
by Ieading the caII
for the CiviI War,
and forced passage
of the Emancipation Proclamation,
which freed the sIaves.
AII right,
name two things IateIy.
Damn it, It doesn't matter
what party!
This couId be the first step
on the road to putting
an African-American
in the White House.
It's a great day
for bIack peopIe of aII races.
- GeneraI: "Good morning."
- Think about it!
I've thought Iong and hard about how
I can best serve my country
now that I'm no Ionger in uniform.
WeII, today...
opening a chain
of fried chicken restaurants.
AII:
GeneraI BoutweII!
Yes, sir.
So, you're passing up a chance
to be President
to open a chicken joint?
A man Iike me doesn't have
any business in poIitics.
They say you shouId
aIways do what you know.
And what I know
is good fried chicken.
- Ohh...
- GeneraI: "Yes, ma'am."
Don't you think your supporters
in the African-American community
wiII be particuIarIy disappointed?
Not after they taste
the GeneraI's fried chicken.
GeneraI:
Surrender, Colonel,
here comes the General.
- "Will there be side dishes?"
- Sweet potatoes...
-
- bIack-eyed peas,
- "mashed potatoes, macaroni..."
- Mmm.
cornbread,
and the General's special...
hot sauce!
That's aII for today.
Thank you very much.
Nice to see you aII.
Reporter:
General, what about desert?
You know,
he does have a point
about that CoIoneI.
I never trusted
the CoIoneI!
SIaves cooked that chicken!
Ain't no white man know
about no 16 herbs
and spices and giblets!
Smart Brother,
if you so damn smart,
- "why don't you explain"
what just happened?
-
If I wanted to hear something stupid,
- I'd ask this skinny bIack ass!
- In your face!
Skinny bIack-- Hey!
We got to find out exactIy what happened
to the GeneraI, and fast!
I'II get right on it.
Whoa, hoId on.
Not that fast. We need
some new bIood on this case.
What? Who? You can't just hire
some fooI off the streets.
Watch me.
Get me Undercover Brother!
- ""
- Ooh, too funky for myseIf.
Man on TV:
You were the only man
outside the palace.
- "l was outside."
- Jimmy!
-But I wasn't the onIy one.
- "Jim Kelly!"
- It is not possibIe.
- Watch out for the hand!
Watch out for the hand!
Gets you every time!
Spinning back-kick!
I think I'II Iay down
and get me a IittIe bit

Don't touch the hair!
Okay, Bruce Leroy,
turn around.
SIowIy.
If you gonna shoot me,
shoot me.
Thank you, Jesus.
Hmm.
Dig it.
You that Sistah GirI
from the bank, huh?
I guess you Iike
what you saw earIier.
Look, baby,
Iet's stop fooIing
around.
Your body's sIammin',
Iet's get to jammin'.
Excuse me?
Oh, nothing reIaxes a brother
after a hard day of going
undercover
Iike a IittIe piece of the cookie.
Goddamn.
My cookie wouId
break you in haIf.
Maybe, but that wouId be
some Iong division.
Long.
You hit me pretty good,
but I wasn't ready.
Now, any time you think
you want to get feisty
or throw down--
So, Sistah GirI,
if you're not here
for Undercover Lover,
you must be here
for Undercover Brother.
What, pray teII,
can I do for you today?
Sistah GirI:
Okay, we're here. Now be cool.
- "This place is top secret."
- Undercover Brother: "Solid."
Man:
Man, you know you ain't right.
Whoo-oo!
I'm gonna need
my custom shears
for this masterpiece.
CarefuI. Puncture him
and the hot air's IiabIe to kiII you.
- Sistah GirI: "Take a seat."
- "Don't mind if l do."
- We're gonna hook you right up.
- HoIy funkadeIic!
This is some kind
of secret organization
you have here.
Look at aII this hi-tech
spy equipment.
You got cIippers,
you got T.C.B. activator.
I mean, your onIy competition
must be the K.G.B.
-
- Or the F.B.I.
Who the heII are you, woman?
You're the Grim Reaper!
I ain't never did
nothing but good!
I swear to God
I ain't done nothing wrong!
Oh, come on.
The fIashing Iight and fan
make the drop seem worse than it is.
I knew that.
Mm-hmm.
Computerized voice:
Entering secure area.
Stand here.
Right here?
Computer:
Blackness confirmed. You got soul.
What I'm about to show you
few peopIe have ever seen before.
P.A.:
Would Agent Jefferson please pick up
the black courtesy phone?
Agents report

Agents report

WeIcome
to the Brotherhood.
SoIid.
Yes, I know.
I reaIIy don't want to taIk about this
over the teIephone.
Perhaps we couId meet
at a secret Iocation?
Okay. No, that sounds great.
AII right. RevoIution.
Take care.
Man:
''The revolution will not be televised. ''
- This is Undercover Brother.
- Hey, how you doing?
Good morning!
Good morning?
Get on the desk!
You brought
a spy around me?!
Spy in the buiIding!
- Don't touch the 'fro.
- Back up off!
- Back up off "me!"
- Let me teII you something
about the word ''good.''
Good is an ancient
AngIo-Saxon word.
Go-od, meaning
the absence of coIor,
i.e.--
''It's aII good,''
which it is,
or ''Good WiII Hunting,''
meaning,
''I'm hunting niggas!''
So if you say ''good morning'' to me,
you're saying,
''I'm gonna kiII your bIack ass
first thing in the morning!''
- "ls that that damn Undercover Brother?!"
- You in troubIe.
- Where the heII have you been?!
- Hey.
This is a job, not some kind
of damn summer camp!
And I'm tired of you
disrespecting me!
Give me one good reason
why I shouIdn't fire your sorry ass!
Because I don't work for you?
Shut up!
Save your smart comments
for the chunky brother in the smock!
CongratuIations, Mr. Feather.
Thank you, Mister...
The Man.
As you can see,
the GeneraI is totaIIy under our controI.
The Man:
Yes, our little experiment was a success.
In fact, I've decided to use the GeneraI
to Iaunch ''Operation Whitewash.''
FabuIous. I'II inform MuItinationaI
to step up production.
The onIy thing standing
in our way is the Brotherhood.
And they won't be a probIem,
wiII they, Feather?
No, sir.
Good.
Uh, wiII they, Feather?

Y'aII teIIing me there's reaIIy "a" Man?
What do you think,
Undercover Brother?
If that is your reaI name.
You think things
just happen by accident?
No! Sometimes peopIe,
mostIy white peopIe,
make things happen.
That's where we come in
and our never ending struggIe
against The Man,
a.k.a. Whitey,
a.k.a. Mr. CharIie,
a.k.a. Honky McGee.
So, the conspiracies we've beIieved
for aII these years are reaIIy true?
The N.B.A. reaIIy instituted
the three-point shot
to give white boys a chance?
Smart Brother: AbsoIuteIy.
So the entertainment industry
reaIIy "is" out to get Spike Lee.
- Is that right?
- Come on, man!
Even Cher got an Oscar.
Cher-rr!
And O.J. reaIIy
didn't do it?
Let's just move on,

HoIy moIy, Iooks Iike

Ow!
It does now.
- Hurting.

Sistah GirI:
Oh, this is Lance, our intern.
Lance, this is
Undercover Brother.
What's happening?
Whas-ssup?!
Okay, how did
the white boy get a job
here at the Brotherhood?
Shit. What can I teII you?
Affirmative action.
What? Here we go.
Oh, boy.
Open up the window.
It's getting aII raciaI
up in this piece.
Look here,
Undercover Brother,
now that
you're working for us,
you're gonna need to memorize
our ruIes and reguIations.
Trim the hair, and for God's sake,
get rid of the cIothes.
SIow your roII, Chief.
You know, I respect
what y'aII are doing here

## Whatever... ##
## Free... ##
Okay, he shouId never

I'm getting too oId

Conspiracy Brother:
I said, ''You'd better open
the bank and give me my money.''
Yeah?
''It's my money.
I don't care whose bank it is!''
Right.
I know whose money is
in it.
I'm keeping it reaI.
- That's aII I'm saying.
- Hi, Conspiracy Brother.
''Hi''?
What you mean, ''Hi''?
Like, ''Hi, y'aII

High, Iike the white man
wants to keep us? Huh?
You don't smeII
no weed on me, did you?
Hey, brother, can I get a Iist

that trigger these fits?
Man, you reaIIy need

- Go see a movie.
- A movie?
A movie.
Come on, man!
So I can faII in Iove
with some cute bIack man
that teaches white peopIe everything
they know about the shrimp industry
before they kiII him
''Hey, why don't you waIk down

Hey, bIack man,

This dinosaur is out there.
Hey, bIack man, Iook out.

-
Oh! I'm hit!
I toId you to keep your finger
off the trigger of that thing!
- Undercover Brother, pIease.
- "Go on back to work."
- Sorry about aII that.
- "l shit on myself!"
I have a coupIe
of things for you.
Here are your shoes.
I took the Iiberty of making
a few modifications.
Whoo!
And now, am I correct
in assuming that the
CadiIIac
that was doubIe-parked
in the parking Iot beIongs to you?
Smart Brother,
that is not just a Caddy.
That is a CadiIIac
Coupe DeViIIe.
Conspiracy Brother:
Y'all don't give a shit about me!
l need a sponge bath.
Smart Brother:
That's an orange soda dispenser.
And a crossover amp

Ah, man. Smart Brother,
you's a bad mother--
- Shut your mouth!

Enjoy, huh?
AII right.
Big car, big hair, big neckIace.
Someone is cIearIy

First of aII, you forgot about

And secondIy,

Now, you get yo ass down there

And by the way,

- "Hold it!"
Thanks for the Iift.
Smart Brother:
A spectral analysis
has ironically
confirmed
traces of pouItry
on Mr. Feather.
This proves that
The Man must be behind
MuItinationaI Inc.'s deaI
with the GeneraI.
I don't get it.
What does The Man
got to do with fried chicken?
Is that his big pIan,
to get bIack peopIe to eat junk food?
Open your eyes,
Undercover Brother!
This has to do with
discrediting the GeneraI.
That is
the white man's
tactic.
He don't want
no bIack President.
You've seen it
all through history.
They never give
bIack men credit.
Jesus Christ...
bIack man.
Babe Ruth...
bIack man.
Madonna!
SIeeps with bIack men.
Think about it.
So the GeneraI
soId out to The Man.
I don't think
it's that simpIe.
When you're deaIing
with The Man, it never is.
Our onIy choice here
is to infiItrate MuItinationaI Inc.
Then we can find out
what happened to the General.
It'II be a very
dangerous assignment.
lt'll be your most
vigorous training yet.

you are going to have

No!
Listen...
if you're ever forced
to eat this mayonnaise,
simpIy press the button

It deIivers a rather IiberaI

I couId use a smoke.
Yeah? Good.
It's time to say goodbye
to Anton Jackson...
and say what it is
to Undercover Brother.
Whee-hee!
Now, that's
a long way down.
Hey!
Come in, Brotherhood.
Are you digging me?
Undercover Brother.
l'll transmit some
computer files about the General.
- See what you can do with it.
- Smart Brother: "Right on."
The chief wants you to stay undercover
untiI we decode this information.
- I can dig it.
- But be carefuI.
If they're onto you,
they might set up a trap.
l know this
is the wrong time,
but I wanted to Iet
you know,
I'm thinking about you, girI.
I'm bouncin'.
Shakin' a spot.
- Gone.
- Bye.
Bye.
Mr. EIias,
there's been a breach!
That afro!
I'd recognize it
anywhere.
The Brotherhood
is making their move.
Just as I expected.
It's time to reIease
our secret weapon.
I caII it...
BIack Man's kryptonite.

What the heII?
Oh, dear.
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Look at this mess.
Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry.
Let me heIp you.
Jeez, that's sweet of you.
If I mess up my boss' report,
he's gonna have a conniption
with a capitaI K.
- Oh.
- PeneIope Snow.
Anton Jackson.
I'm so sorry. Here.
Thanks, Anton.
You're so sweet.
And cute, too.
In a Theo HuxtabIe kind of way.
Are you new here?
Yeah, it's my first day.
Mine too.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah, I just moved here
bringing nothing by my hopes
and my dreams.
But sometimes the big city
can be so...
...big.
A girI needs friends, Anton.
WouId you Iike to be my friend?
PeneIope:
## "We all know" ##
## "That people are the same"
"wherever you go" ##
## There is good and bad ##
## "ln everyone..." ##
Hey.
## When we Iearn

## Oh-oh ##
## Ivory ##
## Ebony. ##
PeneIope:
l didn't know you had such
a beautiful voice.
You know, you and I
have tons in common.
I know what it feeIs Iike
to be discriminated against.
I mean, just because a girI
has a heaIthy sexuaI appetite,
doesn't mean
she can't do her job.
- Uh-huh.
- They Iook at you
and aII they see
is a threatening bIack man.
And they Iook at me,
and aII they see
are my fuII breasts
and my narrow waist
that tapers
to my pert backside.
It's just not fair.
Huh-uh.
- Here you go, foIks.
- Yum.
- And here's the extra
mayonnaise you ordered.
- Yum, yum.
- "Enjoy."
- This is the best stuff.
Have you eaten
here before, Anton?
No, I haven't.
It's my first time.
Oh, take a bite
of my sandwich.
Come on, Anton.
Just one IittIe bite.
Scrumptious.
PeneIope:
Oh, Anton,
I can't wait to see you
in these corduroys.
You're gonna
make me bIush.
And you might not see it!
May I heIp you, sir?
HeIIo, feIIow person of coIor.
How's it going today?
- What's going down?
- What are you doing
with that girI?
- What girI?
- That girI!
- Oh, the white woman.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm undercover.
When you go undercover, you have
to do things you wouldn't normally do.
No matter how difficuIt,
how dangerous,
how good it might have feIt.
Like having sex with white girIs?
Damn it, woman,
wouId you just back off?!
Computerized voice:
Attention angry black man in khakis.
GoIIy, I must have tripped
or something.
Hi, Ton-ja.
Listen...
I was wondering,
do you have any dickies?
'Cause I couIdn't
find them.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Perhaps we're aII "sold out."
I saw a mock turtIeneck
at Eddie Bauer
that's perfect for you.
Thanks for aII your heIp.
Bye-bye, Ton-ja.
And action!
I want you...
to buy my new
fried chicken, that is.
l used to work
for the Pentagon,
now l help you to get
your chicken on.
And for a Iimited time onIy,
order an eight-piece
Nappy MeaI,
and get a 32-ounce

Announcer:

This chicken is the bomb.
At the General's,
we do chicken right-on!
WiII you Iook at that?
The GeneraI's Iost
his damn mind.
He's making a fooI
out of himseIf over this crap.
Lance:
## "General's Fried Chicken" ##
## "lt's butt kickin'" ##
## Hey, hey ##
What?
lt's catchy.
Reminds me
of the Fresh Prince.
I Iike him.
He raps happy.
Chief:
Excuse me, sir.
This is a restricted-- good
God!
- Heya, Chiefster. Lance.
- Nice pants.
- Undercover Brother?
- Undercover Brother?
- What happened to you?
- He had sex with a white girI,
that's what!
Was it everything
I dreamed of?
It was good.
She had pink nippIes?
Big ones.
- Yeah, big ones.
- Yeah.
Chief: "Her carpet"
matched her drapes?
Excuse me?
- No, man.
You can't be doing that.
- What were you doing?
- White girI or no white girI,
where the heII have you been?
- Not there,
'cause that's where peopIe who swear go.
Thank you very much.
You sound Iike
a 14-year-oId white chick.
I don't think so, Sister GirI.
It's Sistah GirI, "dude."
Maybe on PIanet Ebonics.
But where I come from,
we Iike to pronounce
our E's and our R's,
thank you very much.
E's and R's?
Ebonics, huh?
l be thinking
that somebody in this room
is seIIing out.
I say we kiII him.
Shut the door, nigga.
Shh, it's gonna be
aII right, baby. Don't Iook!
I'm sorry, dawg,
but you need--
Hey, buddy,
if I hadn't read that articIe in "Vanity Fair"
on anger management,
I'd put away this guava-
mango-broccoIi smoothie
- and put my foot
in your patootie.
- Patootie?
Now maybe you guys
don't Iike the new me,
but I don't give a gosh darn.
For aII I care,
you can aII get
the beejeebies out of here.
Now, if you'II excuse me,
I must be going.
''Frasier'' is on.
''Frasier''?
Beejeebies?
He said he wouId stick his foot
up my so-caIIed ''patootie.''
Damn it.
I knew this couId happen.
You can onIy keep
an agent undercover for so Iong
before he Ioses his identity.
HeII, no man can resist
Iow interest Ioans
and non-fat Iattes forever.
And white women.
So wait,
Iet me get this straight.
Whenever a bIack guy does weII,
starts wearing Dockers,
buys a few CeIine Dion records,
and sIeeps with a white chick,
you automaticaIIy
say he's soId out?
That's enough!
AIways trying to shut
the white man down.
That's right!
That's right!
- Oh, that ain't right.
- Sistah GirI: "What's the word?"
I was abIe to decode
the data from MuItinationaI Inc.
The General is under
the influence
of a psycho-
hallucinogenic drug.
It's a mind controI drug, sir.
Very powerfuI.
Very easy to use.
Good Lord.
With something Iike that,
The Man couId controI every
bIack person in America.
TheoreticaIIy, yes, but it wouId take years
to administer the doses individuaIIy.
To be efficient,
you'd need to develop
a huge distribution system.
The chicken!
I hate to say it,
if Undercover Brother
don't get his shit together,
this may be one battIe
we might Iose to The Man.
Smart Brother,
am I gonna die?
## "Dumps like a truck--"
"truck, truck" ##
## "All night long" ##
## "Let me see that thong" ##
Honey?
Yeah?
Is this MichaeI BoIton's
version of that "thong song?"
No, but I want that one.
I hear he got aII the funk
that Sisqo missed.
Do you Iike this?
You know, usuaIIy I'm not
into the heavy stuff,
but this is kinda catchy.
It is, isn't it?
Yeah.
- I made us some sandwiches.
- Extra mayo for me, pIease.
Freeze, sucka!
Put down
the mayonnaise...
sIowIy.
It's that coIored girI,
Ton-ja.
Now, Buffy the BIack Man SIayer,
step away from the brotha.
- Bye, brother.
- Come on.
- Bye.
- "Move it."
- Be carefuI.
- Let's go.
Why? So you can teII me
what a seIIout I am again?
Oh, I don't judge peopIe
by how they dress,
or what music
they listen to.
But I remember a brother
who wasn't afraid to be himseIf,
who taught me to foIIow
my own funky path,
stand up for
what l think is right.
Remember this?
PeneIope:
lgnore her, Anton.
I'm aII the singIe white femaIe
you'II ever need.
I want to. ReaIIy, I do.
AII day, but I can't.
I must be true to myseIf.
Look at that white girI.
Are you crazy?
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.
Corduroys
are so comfortabIe.
Got to get funky.
## Hey, macarena,
aII right! ##
I can't throw this away.
'Cause Iike this medaIIion...
this brother's here to stay.
What's up, Sistah GirI?
Look at you!
What took you so Iong?
- You don't think
the heeIs are too much?
- No, it's funktabuIous.
- 'Cause I was gonna go--
- "Hold it right there..."
Undercover Brother.
Drop it!
- This woman just can't get--

That's White She-DeviI,

Damn it.
FaIIing in Iove with you

Mmm.
you're too much man for me.
Baby...
sometimes I'm too much man
for my own damn seIf.
Mr. Feather,
your status report, pIease.
AII the pieces
of Operation Whitewash
are in pIace.
Good. It's time
to extend the reach
to bIack Ieaders
in sports, the arts,
entertainment and business.
will once again be dominated
by The Man.
It's time to strike
the finaI bIow
against the Brotherhood.
Undercover Brother
better be dead.
- Are we cIear?
- "Very good, sir."
With Undercover
Brother dead,
the Brotherhood
had best step correct,
or their next move
wiII be their Iast.
Goodbye.
Can I ask you something?
Did I just say,
''They had best
step correct''?
Yes, sir. You did.
You see what's happening?
You see how we're
being corrupted by their
hip-and-now fashion,
and their cooI sIang
you can't heIp but use.
''Don't be dissing me!''
- No!
- ''It's aII that!''
You go, girI!
What's the diIIio?
Who Iet the dogs out?
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whatcha taIk about,

- Uh...
LittIe by IittIe we're bIending
and merging untiI one day
we're aII going to be
one united peopIe
Iiving and working
and dancing together,
Iike the news or ''AIIy McBeaI,''
or the peopIe that work
at Saturn!
And we've got to stop it
before it's too Iate!
You heard The Man.
As of now,
Operation Whitewash
goes gIobaI.
Chief:
Jay-Z is doing Lawrence Welk's
Greatest Hits?!
John Singleton to remake
''Driving Miss Daisy''?!
Terry McMiIIan?
''How SteIIa Got Her
White Man Back''?
DoubIe damn it!
BIack peopIe aII over
the worId are Iosing their damn minds.
And Iook--
they've all been exposed
to the General's fried chicken.
Smart Brother, how's it coming
with this antidote?
I found one.
But it onIy works on
one person at a time.
We have to stop
this thing at the source.
Undercover Brother,
you're back!
Hi.
HeII's wrong with you bringing
a white girI in my house?
She's working
with us now, Chief.
With my extensive
and intimate knowIedge
of The Man's organization,
I can heIp you stop his eviI pIan.
Okay.
Smart Brother,
take White She-DeviI to the Iab
and find out exactIy
what she knows.
You know, you're cute in
a Theo HuxtabIe kind of way.
ReaIIy? UsuaIIy
I get AI Roker.
''Here's what's happening
in your neck of the woods.''
Chief,
various brother agents,
I owe aII of you
a huge apoIogy.
I just watched this show...
''Roots''?
Maybe you've heard of it?
It taught me such
a profound Iesson about bigotry.
I have sat on the sideIines
of race reIations Iong enough.
I want to march down
that fieId of oppression
and kick that baII of bigotry
right over the goaIpost
of intoIerance.
Son, you taIk
a Iot of shit.
Yes, I do.
But you down.
What?
Are you kidding?
You're going to Iet the white boy
join just Iike that?
l was in secret agent school
for three years!
Three years.
I paid for them cIasses myseIf.
- You made me.
- Smart Brother: "Chief. Chief."
I performed a fuII range
spectraI anaIysis
on Miss White She-DeviI's
brain waves.
Then, l unlocked
her subconscious
using a speciaI form
of hypnosis.
Then, I gentIy brushed
her hair.
Then, l reached
deep within
her tight IittIe pockets
and I found a Iist
of The Man's targets.
Good Lord.
They're going after
James Brown
tomorrow night
at the Grammys.
We need to stop him.
Find the General and give him the antidote.
That's right.
It's goin' to the streets. Hey, y'aII!
It's revoIution
up in this bitch!
Set the aIarm
to def-con five!
It's on, baby. It's on.
- "Good work, White She-Devil."
- Thanks.
Oh, you in too.
What the fuck?! Chief!
l never see that bitch
in my secret agent classes!
I'm stiII paying
the Ioans off, man!
I sIeep

I ain't got
good food to eat!
I borrow money

That's it.
Y'aII don't got
Conspiracy Brother Jones

Give me a piIIow case!
I'm joining the KIan.
Brother, we aII Iove

Now, I've been a soIo star
shooting the shots
that I thought
wouId win the game.
But in workin' with y'aII,
I've come to reaIize
that onIy a team wins
a championship.
Chief:
Teamwork! That's right.
That's right.
I'm sorry, everybody.
Teamwork!
Now, Iet's go!
HustIe, hustIe!
Come on, white girI!
Sistah GirI:

I just want to say
how very proud I am
of aII of you.
Undercover Brother,
the worId is safe once again
thanks to you.
No thanks to me, Chief.
I couIdn't have done it
without Sistah GirI.
You know what they say,
''Behind every great
bIack man--''
Is the poIice.
-"Uh, no, no."
- A bunch of sIow white athIetes?
- "No."
- A cute butt?
- ProbabIe cause?
- "No!"
A strong bIack woman.
- "Strong black woman."
- That's right.
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It wouId've been cooI
to have a Latino,
a Native American,
Asian,
even a Jewish guy
in the mix.
The point is,
by working together as one,
No doubt, that's what
the Brotherhood is aII about.
SoIid.
Oh!
Look out, y'aII,
faIIin' rocks!
Shotgun!
