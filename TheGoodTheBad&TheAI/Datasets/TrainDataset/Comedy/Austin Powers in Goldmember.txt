Space was cool, wasn't it Mini me?
Doctor Evil, while you were in space.
I created a way for us to make
hugh sums of legitimate money
and still maintain the ethics
in the business practices
of an evil organization...
I have turned us into a talent agency.
The Hollywood talent agency. -Really?
By charging clients 9% rather
than the traditional 10%
We've been able to signed such star ...
such as George Clooney
Julia Roberts.
And Leo Dicapro.
And the best part of the
whole scheme is...
We all get our own assistance.

Did I pull you too hard?
I don't want to hurt you.
Dr. Evil.

I'm sorry would you like some ice-cream.
Yes, I'd like some chocolate ice-cream.
Perhaps later.
Doctor Evil, I love your plan.
Really?
Yeah doctor, is a really good plan.
Yes, on the whole
I think preparation H is good.
What is it now?
No, nothing. Y'know what? I agree...
Preparation H does feel good.
On the whole,
Well, I'm glad we expected you
to stay linkerity
Well, ladies and gentlemens,
I shall travel back to 1975
Pick up goldmembers and bring it

formed a human influents.
They raised me to be evil.
Nothing compared to this.
being inside the belly of the beast
night after night all alone...
Let's freak.
Time's up.
Visiting time is over.
Move it.
Gentlemens, listen up.
Here is the new plan.

Doesn't mean you deserve one
I'm curious.
Is everything in proportion?
Don't be shy, let's have a look.
My word, you're a tripod.

It was no accident.
It was an assassination attempt.
I thought only Austin survived
I should have told you
the truth earlier.
But those Begium,
they made you so evil.
Very interesting Mr Powers.
I have to see all the facts.
Dad!
Daddy is here.
Dad, what's going on?
What are you going to do Austin?

I especially hate you.
You'll pay.
You'll all pay!
I'd like to point out

Foxy, I'm coming!
Don't do anythying stupid,

I'm not an evil genius.
I could rewire the capacity
of the tractor beam
Come on let's go.
The shooting begins..
You know Dr. Evil. I used to think
you were crazy.
I know.
Now I can see you're not.
I rang you?
