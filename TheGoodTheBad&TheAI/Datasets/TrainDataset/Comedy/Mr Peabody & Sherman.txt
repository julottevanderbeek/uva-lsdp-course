Our story begins
high over New York City...
Oh ,Sorry, you cut me doing
My  yoga.
You were expecting “downward dog” perhaps!?
.
My name is Mr. Peabody.
And since we’re going to be spending  some time together...
... I’d like to
tell you a little bit about myself  .
You see ,
Ever since I was a puppy,
It was clear,
that I was different.
I tried to 'fit in':
"No, thank you"...
But for some reason,
I never was.
Come on, boy,
fetch the  stick!
But why?
Won’t you just throw it again?
It’s an exercise in futility.
I don’t want this one, Mommy.
He’s sarcastic.
Wait, wait, come back!
throw the stick.
I'll stay, I'll heal,
I'll even shake hands!
Bark, bark.
... I dedicated myself to the pursuit of
Knowledge.
culture, and
athletics.
Valedogtorian   of course
Yehh.. .
And then I devoted myself to helping
mankind.
I  Pioneered new
techniques in alternative energy.
resolve the geo-political conflicts
Around the globe.
And in my spare time, I invented
The fist bump...
planking
... The back side olly
and...
And….. the Zoumba!
But what I’m most proud of , is my son:
Sherman.
Hi, Mr. Peabody.
Oh , Have you told them about "WABAC"?
I was just getting to that.
When I adopted Sherman,
I vowed to be the best father I could be.
To prepare him for all the
wonders of the world, present and past.
And so, Sherman
inspired the greatest invention of my life.
A Tiechine  “ time machine”!
Of course, time travel
Can be a little... unpredictable.
There are bound to be a few misapps along the way
Let’s just say, the Leaning Tower of Pisa
wasn’t  always leany.
But there’s nothing like learning the lessons of history firsthand
Right, Sherman?
Where are we going today,
Mr. Peabody?
Not WHERE, Sherman,
WHEN.
Wow this is the biggest house I've ever seen!
it's the palace of Versailles,
home of Marie Antoinette.
You know, she was mostly famous for one thing:
"Cake! I love cakes so much!"
Marie Antoinette surely likes cakes,
Mr. Peabody.
Indeed she does.
Maria was a woman with a prodigious appetite
For all things covered with frosting.
But her expensive taste
made her the target of much criticism.
Why?
Because, Sherman, during Marie’s reign
The common people of France were exceedingly poor.
- Got any bread?
- Not! I am exceedingly poor!
- Now can we have some cake?
- mais oui!
Oh yeah sorry
, may WE have some cake?
mais oui
Maybe she can’t hear me
through the hair.
Sherman, what
the queen means  is...
Ohh Let them eat cake!
And when the Queen hear the poor of Paris
... could not even buy bread...
... she said:
"let them eat cake!"
-Non
-oui, I heard it myself.
- It’s Scandal!
- Shocking!
- Down with the Queen!
- Down with the monarchy!
Wait.
What kind of cake?
Vive la Revolution!
Vive la Revolution!
Smashing party, Your Majesty...
... But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...
Sherman. Sherman!
Sherman!
Sherman?
Sheerman!
- Dear Sherman!
- Hey, Mr. Peabody.
What are you doing in here?
Trying these other cakes.
There is one in here, with whipped cream and strawberries
, that’s...
... pretty fantastic!
Sherman, don’t   you remember why
I told you to stay close to me...
... during the French Revolution?
Because after the French Revolution, it was gonna rain?
- close.
I said, after the French Revolution...
... comes the Reign of Terror!
Vive la   Revolution!
Round the fearistocrats!
The Queen and aristocratic colonies
... must pay the price
for their greed!
We will slaughter them like the dogs,
They are!
Starting with this one!
Mr. Peabody, what should I do?
Nothing Sherman,
Just stay right there!
But Mr. Peabody...
Everything’s going to be fine, Sherman.
Just stay right there!
Chop off his head!
Mr. Peabody!
A cantaloupe?
The lowest of the foods!
Who dares to insult me with this melon?
Get that dog!
Mr. Peabody, how do you escape?
It’s Simple, Sherman.
I noticed the
distance between the sewer lids...
... reasoned  that there must be one
directly under the guillotine platform...
... noted the loose board
under the basket...
... computed the angle at which the setting sun
will bounce off your glasses...
... momentarily blinding the executioner...
... and chose that moment to put the
executioner‘s melon...
...giving me the added weight to tip the board
... to facilitating my exit.
Amazing!
It’s not amazing. It’s just the matter of keeping my head.
Keeping your head...
I don’t get it.
There he is!
After them!
Come on, Sherman, quick!
This water taste terrible!
Interestingly,
That’s not water!
Ha Ha I’ve got you now!
Indeed, you have monsieur Robespierre...
... And what a master of the chase you are!
Oh you know this?
Of course. Doubling back on me like that
, that  was genius.
Thank you.
I just hoped you don’t  take
my little confederate   here,
I depend on him so completely.
Get over here you!
- You are devilishly clever, sir.
- I know.
And much quicker than you as well.
But are you quick enough...
... for this?
Ha Ha See? quick!
Quick yes,
but not too smart.
Oh  ,  Another cantaloupe!
Your sword.
Alright , Sherman looks like
It’s  time
for a little pop quiz in your offensing!
Go!
Forward! Pairing!
right! Repeat!
-ha ha you missed!
- I never miss.
-Come on!
- wowww , Yes!
Do you smell that, Sherman?
It wasn’t me, Mr. Peabody.
I know. It wasn’t you. It’s methane gas in the sewer system.
And giving the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...
... we’re about to use it,
to blast out of here!
hang on!
wooow
Nice landing,
hey, Sherman?
So, what did you learn today, Sherman?
The French revolution
was crazy!
How so?
All those
executions and heads dropped off...
... and nobody stand up and say  it
was not right.
And think:
Marie Antoinette
could have avoided the whole revolution
If she simply issued and edict...
... to distribute bread amongst the poor.
But then, she could not have a dessert.
Why, Mr. Peabody?
Because Sherman,
You can’t have your cake and edict too.
I don’t get it.
Where we gonna go tomorrow, Mr. Peabody?
Ancient Rome?   The Wild West?
1492?
No, Sherman. Tomorrow we won’t be going to any of
those places.
Why not ?
because
tomorrow's adventure is one that
you’re going to be taking all on your own.
What do you mean, Mr. Peabody?
Do not you remember?
It's your first day of school!
- Can I drive?
- Of course not!
New York-Today
And remember, Sherman:
no i before e, except before c'.
I know, Mr. Peabody.
And do not forget about the translational principle:
I know, Mr. Peabody.
And if you have to go to the bathroom...
... just raise  your hand proudly,
and say, "I have to go."
I will, Mr. Peabody.
And remember, the No. 2 pencil
Is standard for most uses...
... but there are times ,
When  the No. 1 Comes in handy
I left a little pencil charge
in your backpack
... which you can use
whenever needed.
I think I'll be okay.
- ok, bye, Mr. Peabody.
- Wait.
'll See you after school.
- Sherman!
- I gotta go...
... I got to sign up for the clubs.
Sherman , no one is  more in favor of   ...
... participation in fraternal organizations than I.
But before you go...
... I want you to have this.
Thanks.
What is it?
A dog whistle.
It doesn’t work, Mr. Peabody.
It …Works fine, Sherman.
It’s just a frequency only dogs
Can hear.
Oh , cool.
Let that little keepsake  be a reminder to you
...
... that no matter what challenges you face
...
... no matter however far away  I might seem
...
bye , Mr. Peabody!
... I am with you.
George Washington.
Who can tell me, who he is?
Oh, me! I can, I can!
O. .. Sherman.
The first president of the United States of America.
Good job.
And when President Washington was a little boy
...
... what kind of tree did he cut down?
I, I! Me!
- Penny.
- A cherry tree.
apocryphal!
What kind of tree is that?
It’s not a tree, it’s a word:
apocryphal.
It Means that the story is not true.
really?
Yeah. George Washington
never   cut down a cherry tree...
... and he never said that
He can lie.
People made those stories
..to teach kids a lesson about lying  .
But they’re not true.
he did cross the Delaware River,
Christmas night in 1776 though.
My dad took me there this summer.
we crossed it too.
I fell in .
Ha,looks like someone really know
The history.
ha, Penny?
It’s really great meeting you,
guys.
Maybe you can come over to my house sometime .
I could bring
my new 'model'.
It’s a hydrogen atom.
you've Only got one, hah ?
Yes, we have to split it.
Good one.
Check it , guys.
What do you got there, Sherman? Kibbles or Bits?
Actually, I’ve got baby   carrots, organic apple juice...
... and tuna sandwich.
It’s super high in omega3.
So you eat human food, hah?
Yes, why wouldn’t I?
Because you're a dog.
No, I'm not.
- sure you are.
Your dad’s a dog, so
You’re a dog too.
I think you’re confused.
It’s an adoptive relationship.
- zip it, Carl.
- ok.
Here , 'll Show you. fetch.
Go on, doggy,
Go get your lunch.
Go on. Go get it!
the humiliation!
Sherman, go get your food.
Make like a good little doggie.
- What’s this?
- It’s mine. Give it back!
What is it? A Whistle?
The stupid thing.
It doesn’t even work.
it's   for dogs, penny
It operates send a frequency that only dogs can hear.
- back up, Carl.
- ok.
Penny, that whistle‘s my private property.
Give me back!
- Jump, doggy, jump!
- I'm not a dog.
Come on, Sherman. Just Admit it,
you're a dog.
- Sit!
- Let me go!
Not until you beg like a dog.
Come on, Sherman. beg.
Thank you for coming in on such short notice
...
... to discuss the problem with
Sherman.
Oh , it’s not a problem, at all  principal prudey
I fully expected this.
You did?
Yes, and as with all thing Sherman related,
I prepared for it.
Here is a curriculum, that takes Sherman
Advanced preparation in acount...
... but we both require you to skip on grade.
Mr. Peabody...
There is some pre-algebra work , sheet and advanced reading list...
and a link to a web Site that I created...
... to start studying mandarin Chinese.
It is after all the language of the future.
Mr. Peabody!
I'm not saying that we shouldn’t study and French too,
Principal Purdy I’m saying have a new look...
Mr. Peabody!
What? not enough?
Swahili?
Sherman got into a fight today.
Oh , dear...
Pictures were taken,
for insurance purposes.
He bit her.
I must say, it does not look good for you
, Mr. Peabody.
After all... you are a dog.
Who may I ask are you?
I am Miss Grunion from
The bureau of child Safety and Protection.
We required by law to contact them whenever,
there is an ...
... incident.
Sherman has never done anything
Like this before.
I'm sure he must have had a reason.
- well ,The girl was being bit of a bully  ...
- quiet , Purdy!
It is normal for children to tease.
It’s not Normal for them to bite.
Clearly it’s because of how he’s being raised.
In my opinion,
A dog can never be
A suitable parent to a little boy.
I must point out, Miss Grunion, that
I won the right to adopt
Sherman in a court of law.
And the court
Can take it away from you!
I’ll be coming to your home tomorrow evening,
To conduct an investigation.
If I discover that you are in anyway an unfit parent...
... I will see to it,
Sherman is removed from your custody
Permanently.
I hope I made myself clear.
crystal.
I’m Sorry I bit her,
Mr. Peabody.
I won’t do it again.
you've done two thing, you wont do it again.this kind of
want and violence is totally unacceptable.
And rather uncharacteristic,
given how you feel about Mr. Gandhi.
What on earth provoked it?
She called me a dog.
Well.
Alright then thank you for telling me.
Trying get some sleep.
I love you, Mr. Peabody.
I have a deep regard for you as well,
Sherman.
Mr. Peabody , you're a Nobel Prize winning scientist.
And added to the head of stick
A 'Captain' of industry.
Why would you want to adopt a boy?
Because, your honor, when I found
Sherman...
... it reminded me of how I started out
in life.
And now I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted .
A home!
And you're sure you're capable
Of meeting all the challenges
Of raising a human boy?
With all due respect...
... how hard could it be?
Very well, then.
If a boy can adopt a dog...
... I see no reason why a dog cannot adopt
a boy.
- Da-da.
- No, Sherman. Not, da-da.
You should call me Mr. Peabody.
Or in less formal moments, simply
Peabody.
That’s right.
Mr. Pibaba.
What you’re cooking, Mr. Peabody?
Oh, Nothing much.
Just a little Dungeness crab   with the passion fruit...
... And basil sauce, some truffle quail
sauce berries, and...
... baked Alaska .
Wow, is today some kind of special occasion?
You could say.
- It's not my birthday.
- No, it isn’t.
- It's not your birthday.
- Right again.
It’s not Father’s Day, is it?
No, it’s not Father’s Day.
- Is the President coming over for dinner, again?
- No.
Oh so who is coming to dinner?
Let's just say, if the evening
Is a  success...
... we can put this whole biting business
Behind us.
The Petersons!
Welcome!
- So is literally a dog.
- PAUL!
No that’s alright .
Although I  prefer
the "literate dog."
That’s Funny!
Isn’t that funny, Paul?
He is not a big laugher.
We are so delighted you could
Make it on such short notice.
Aren’t we Sherman?
Aren’t we, Sherman?
Yes,i've just into know what's going on.
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.
Hi, Penny.
Hello, Sherman!
Now why don’t you go show penny
your mineral collection, sherman?
I am sure we will find those new
geodes of yours  fascinating.
Come on.
I’m so glad you accepted my invitation.
Now the kids can resolve their differences...
... before   Miss Grunion arrives.
You barking up the wrong tree , Mr!
In fact, if it wasn’t for patty
I would have press charges already.
Now I have to tell you , Peabody...
Where  my daughter,
is concerned nothing is more important than...
Hello?
sure, I ‘ll  take the survey.
Everything’s going swimmingly?
Why didn’t you tell me she was coming over here?
because I didn’t want you to worry.
ok. Because I did not want to listen to
your belly-aching.
- Thanks for your honesty.
- You’re welcome.
I do not know what
You think that we supposed to do anyway.
She Hates me!
Share her your interests.
Tell her wired anecdotes.
Mr. Peabody, I hate her.
Sherman  every great relationship starts
-from a place ofconflict...
... and evolves into something richer.
Bon chance .
Make it work.
Do not tell her about the WABAC.
Do not even think about it .
Peabody, that was amazing!
Paul, wasn’t that amazing?
I'm more in the rock ' n ' roll.
I Meant the flamingos.
Bagpipes?
Didgeridoo.
Sitar .
Steel Drums
.
Trombone.
Xylophone.
Drum.
Organ.
Oboe.
Piccolo
.
Touba.
Dobro
.
Whistle.
You know what?
This has been but a complete waste of time.
Let’s  get Penny,
and go home- ..!
Are you alright, Paul?
I'm... fine!
This happens whenever he’s tense.
Paul, if I might...
Stay away from me, Peabody!
Just get back!
I need traction.
You can trust me, Paul.
I am a licensed chiropractor.
Peabody!
I feel great!
I really feel great!
Peabody, you’re a miracle worker!
Look at me. I’m dancing!
You know, Penny...
... Sigmund Freud says,
that if you do not like a person...
... Because they remind you of something
you don’t like about yourself.
what do you know about Sigmund Freud?
More than you think.
Surely . Just like you knew all that stuff about George Washington
not really cutting down  the cherry tree.
- What a crup!
- But it's true!
- How do you know?
- I just know!
- did You read it in a book?
- No.
-     see it in a movie?
- No.
Did your brainiac dad tell you?
No!
so how do you know, Sherman?
How-Do  You -KNow?
He Told me.
- Who told you?
- George Washington.
George Washington.
Yeah.
Liar.
Do not tell her about the WABAC.
He calls it the  "WABAC".
So where have you gone it in?
Not where  , Penny.
When.
Okey , smart guy.
when.
Can
It go back to an hour ago?
Why?
Because I can take it home,
Pretend to be sick...
... and not come
To this lame dinner party.
Mr. Peabody says,
you should never use the
WABAC..
... to travel to a time
When you existed  .
How come?
There   be two of you  .
Ohhh, Yeah . I guess  the world’s
not ready for that.
Now that we ‘ve seen it ,
Maybe we should go   back.
Are you Kidding?
Where should we go first?
Mr. Peabody says I’m
not allowed to drive it until I’m older.
You do everything Mr. Peabody says?
Yeah...
You know what that makes you, Sherman?
An obedient son.
No. A dog.
Nice control!
Don’t let it go, Patty.
Hands up, Paul!
Here we go.
Oh ,Yeah!
Look at this.
This is a little home-spun concoction
I‘d like to call:
" Einstein on the beach".
- To the kids .
- To the kids!
- Mr. Peabody!
- Sherman?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Of Course.
Excuse me.
I’ve really hit off with Penny’s parents.
I think we can file
this night
Under   "unqualified success".
- I’d hold off filing it just yet.
- What do you mean?
Where is Penny?
Ancient Egypt...
You Use the WABAC?
What's happening, big guy?
We’re running   low.
Ill be right there, Paul.
How
... how could you do such a thing?
She called me a liar,
For saying   George Washington
never cut  down a cherry tree.
so you took her to see
George Washington?
Yeah.. she was into it.
- Hey, Peabody.
- Hey.
- Where is Penny?
- Playing hide and seek.
- Pooping.
- Pooping...
- playing hide and seek.
Well, which is it?
What's going on here?
Yeah, what's going on here?
- What have you done with Penny?
- Penny?
Penny! Penny!
- oh my gosh.
- Where ‘s our daughter?
It's hard to say, Paul...
She could be here...
... or here, or here, or here, or here
...
that will hold them.
I learned that trick from a swami, at the
Ubud Bali.
Let’s go !
Ancient Egypt!
Land of the Pharaohs.
A Lighthouse of progress on horizon of humanity.
But a cruel and barbarous civilization just the same .
I just hope penny isn’t suffering too badly.
What are you doing here?
We have come to take you home.
What’s the Egyptian word
For  tattle-tale?
Mofshi –a-ser “ مفشی السر.”
But that’s beside the point.
Get your clothes on, we’re going home.
Who died and made you ,pharaoh?
Now bring on the mani-peddi!
see, Mr. Peabody?
Impossible!
Indeed.
But watch what happens...
... when an immovable object  ,
meets an irresist force.
Penny, come here, right now.
Penny, come on.
I am not penny anymore.
Now I'm the princess Hatshepsut,
precious flower of the Nile!
Precious, perhaps, but if you think we’re
Going to leave you here...
... You are most definitely in DE-Nile.
I don’t get it.
Now, come along.
Unhand her!
What's the matter, my sweet, little
Desert blossom?
Are these barbarians
Bothering you?
As the matter of fact, they are.
Bow barbarians!
As you wish, Your highness.
Who‘s that, Mr. Peabody?
That, Sherman, is the living image of Amon,
Son of  Akhenaten ,the lord of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom...
... King Tutankhamun.
- Otherwise known as King Tut.
- My boyfriend.
King Tut is your boyfriend?
-uhuum
-would you like me to have them skinned, covered with honey,
… And layed in a pit of fire ants?
you do that for me?
Anything, my Desert Flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.
- What? You can’t marry this guy?
- Why not?
Well for one , his name rhymes with
'butt'.
I do not care.
I’m gonna have a big, fat
Egyptian wedding.
Spoiler alert:
king tut dies young.
Are you sure   you‘ve thought this through?
Oh trust me, I thought it through.
I’m getting everything.
The royal astronomy had decreed.
Your wedding must take place tomorrow.
At Dawn.
- Who is he?
- He is Ay.
He is you?
I am Ay, the Grand Vizier.
Yeah , that’s his name.
Oh grand Vizier   , would you mind telling
The precious Princess   here...
...  precisely what it means to be married
the young pharaoh?
Gladly.
It Means she will be bound to him in eternity.
Through these
sacred ceremonies of disembowelment...
... and mummification.
As described in the Holy text.
Uh , hold up a second.
Can you walk me through that , somebody?
What he means, Penny,
Is that when I die,
they kill you,too.
And then they rip out your organs,
Stuff them in canopic jars...
... and the mummify what ever’s left.
Ok , I’m seeing this  now.
Thank you.
I’m gonna Go with them.
There's no turning back, now!
To the Palace!
Let the wedding preparations begin!
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!
Do something!
Do not worry, Penny,
we'll save you!
Hey ,Wait !
You can’t just...
... leave us here.
- Mr. Peabody?
- Yes, Sherman?
Can I Hold Your Hand?
Of course you can.
boy. Your hand’s cold,
Mr. Peabody.
- Sherman?
- Yeah?
That’s not my hand.
That’s  disarming.
Now, to find the way out of here
...
Look around  , Sherman.
These tombs are lined with hieroglyphics design...
... To assist the Pharaoh ‘s souls...
... in their journey toward the eternal life.
And they may assist us as well.
This the pics the god of  Anubis,
Sailing the boat of Ra
To the underworld.
It appears the boats of
Ra are the key to our escape.
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.
If you ask me, we should let her
marry that guy.
They deserve each other.
What’s that Sherman?
Tut, give me a break.
Bald, wears a skirt and makeup?
If I did not any better, Sherman,
I would say that you're jealous.
jealous?
Of what?
Tut’s affection for Penny,
Of  course.
you think I like Penny?
Give me a break.
It‘s not like I want to ….. hold her hand...
... or go to the park  ...
... or watch her while she’s brushing her hair...
. .. or anything...
Quickly, Sherman.
careful, Sherman.
It’s a booby trap.
- What's so funny?
- You said booby.
One wrong step and we are done forever.
The boat...
... of  Ra...
... sails straight...
... to day.
Take-the –wrong - boat...
... man-will pay.
alright, Sherman,
Now it's your turn.
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.
Think it through.
One step at a time.
... I mean, ‘pay’.
Oh my...
The boats of the Ra.
One boat is the way out...
...  the other will send us
Wandering into darkness and in certain death.
What?
Sherman, get on the boat.
As soon as I move these blocks together,
It’s going to move very fast.
- Which boat, Mr. Peabody?
- What?
What is I’m not certain that’s wrong boat ?
That one!
We did it, Sherman!
Sherman?
Mr. Peabody!
What are you doing over there?
I thought you pointed at this one.
Sherman?
Sherman!
Are you alright?
I'm good.
The sun god Ra,
commands us to begin...
... the sacred ceremony!
Bring forth the plate
for the blood oath!
Where   blade meets flesh,
in the sacred right  ...
... we pay tribute
To the sun God, Ra.
Wait!
The Anubis, the god of Death!
The wedding must not continue!
Why, Anubis, why?
plagues! Flames!
If this marriage packed in sealed …..
... I will shower down upon the land,
uncountable plagues.
Why again with the plagues?
What did I ever move to Egypt?
but, Anubis, the sun god, Ra,
has declare...
... that this girl is to be the
Boy –king‘s wife.
That’s so funny.
I was talking to the sun god Ra just the other day...
... and he told me he changed his mind.
really?
Oh , the flip flap Ra we call it , here in the underworld.
But it's too late.
We have already paid for the catering.
Too bad you’re going to lose your deposit.
one smoke, Sherman.
This trick is  working.
deliver the girl to the gates of the city...
... And leave her there,
where the gods will retrieve her  forth with.
Only in this manner,
May the plagues upon this land   be avoided.
Anubis  has spoken.
Take this girl
to the gates!
Anubis, you sound unwell.
Well I am   feeling a little under the weather,
but I'm feeling much better now.
Thank you.
Penny, Sherman quickly.
- Come on, Penny!
- Sherman!
Runaway bride!
Stop, them you fools!
Penny Sherman, climb  on board!
They are Getting away!
We made it!
Where do we go next,
Mr. Peabody?
home. We have to get back to the dinner party...
... Before Penny’s parents
Realize she’s missing.
We don’t have to mention the whole...
... King Tut wedding thing , right?
certainly not.
anyway, as far as I’m concerned...
... they get married too young
in Ancient Egypt.
Or... perhaps I’m just some old Giza.
Warning:
WABAC power supply Insufficient.
Charge now.
What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?
All this zipping about the cosmos ...
... is trimmed our power supply.
We are going up to make an unscheduled stop.
As luck we have it...
... we have just enough power to make
to the Renaissance.
I can’t even tell to my left brain...
... command the right , anymore!
How many times I gotta   tell you,
Mona Lisa...
Mona Lisa?
No, no, no!
I cannot paint...
... until you smile!
Leonardo, tell me one thing,
I have to smile about!
The sunshine, the pasta...
... all the things that make Italy such popular destination!
But , I have not seen any of them Leonardo...
... because I’m sitting here all day on my abbondanza!
I do not think that means
'chair' in Italian.
Peabody, my old friend!
What a welcome interruption!
Believe you me , This woman is make me nuts
So, are you banned? Good to see you.
What do you want?
We’re in a desperate hurry to go home...
... but the WABAC
needs a jump start...
... and we thought...
... who better than,
Leonardo Da Vinci...
... to help us on the way.
Peabody I would love to help you...
... but you come in a very bad time.
I do not know what I’m going to do,
with this crazy woman.
You see what I mean?
What is the problem?
What is the problem?
I am half way done with the painting. She won't even smile!
Fine. I smile.
No!
That’s a fake smile!
Everybody knows that.
Why don’t you make a real smile?
Why do not you say something funny?
I paint the paintings,
I make the machines...
... I don’t tell the jokes!
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
You see, humor is not immune
To loss of science.
Using algorithms, we can extrapolate...
... but is universally considered funny.
Thus producing a formula ...
... that is scientifically certain to cause laughter.
Case in point, the pratfall.
Is everyone amused?
The data was so clear...
Do not worry, Mr. Peabody,
I got it!
No, no, Sherman...
Perfect!
hold that smile!
Hold it right there!
Do not move! Don’t move!
Well, Leo, if my calculations are correct...
... This mean an hour should generate
enough centripetal force to send us home.
I’ve got a one last piece to got to pound   in place.
Sherman, why don’t you fetch the hammer
for Mr. Da Vinci?
Okay, Mr. Peabody.
- Mr. Peabody?
- well-done, Sherman.
But Mr. Peabody...!
Very helpful.
Sherman!
Yes, Mr. Peabody?
The Hammer...Da Vinci
Oh ,Okay, Mr. Peabody.
Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
Do you need any Help?
No, no, that’s quite alright.
Thank you.
Sherman!
Let’s Go.
Let's go explore.
Uh , well I’m Supposed to be having
father-son time, with Mr. Peabody.
Would not you rather have fun with me?
okey.
Sherman!
Where are you going?
Exploring.
- But we need your help.
- No, we don’t.
I mean, we can manage,
somehow.
He’s a boy, Peabody.
Let him have some fun.
Let him go.
Thanks, Mr. Peabody.
He’s growing up, Peabody.
Like a baby bird,
leaving the nest.
Isn’t it wonderful?
It's like a museum.
It's like toy store.
Check this one.
It is the world biggest model airplane.
It’s not a model, Penny,
It’s the prototype.
And we should
probably just   leave that alone.
OK.
But wouldn’t it be cool if
We could fly it?
I don’t think Mr. Peabody would like that.
Well, Mr. Peabody isn’t here.
Just tell me how it works.
Please!
for learning.
Uh ,Okay.
The force come from this kind of board...
... then it shoots along the track...
... until wind catches the wings.
But how does it go?
How do you takeoff?
You just pull down that lever.
This one?
Oh boy.
This is crazy!
No , it’s not Sherman.
It's fun!
I’m gonna Die!
o stop being such a giant.
Nothing is as beautiful ...
... as an elegant equation,
translated into perfect engineering.
Why can’t children be
so simple?
Because children are not machines,
Peabody.
believe me .
I tried to build one.
Oh , It was creepy.
Here, Sherman.
You fly it.
But I do wanna fly.
Sure you do.
It’ll be fun!
No seriously, Penny, I don’t want to.
I ‘m letting go.
- One... two...
- Don’t let go!
- No!
-... Three!
Penny, fly the plane!
No, Sherman,
you now have to save us.
But I can’t do it.
I'm Serious, Penny.
I don’t know how to fly!
You can do it.
I know you can.
Come on, Sherman.
fly.
See? You got it, Sherman
You're right.
I have got it!
Mama mia!
The Da Vinci sailed again.
Yes, but I see that the child he made.
So creepy.
Papa. Mama.
I‘ll down up here, Leonardo.
And I'm whole done down here.
It is beautiful, isn’t it?
every piece in its place...
... doing precisely what it suppose to do.
Ey , Look, Peabody!
It’s my flying machine!
My flying machine!
Sherman? Sherman!
Sherman, what are you doing up there?
I'm flying!
But Sherman you don’t know how to fly!
- I don’t?
- No.
Turn. Turn, Sherman.
Lean! Lean!
Sherman! Sherman!
Are you okay?
That was pretty fantastic!
I can’t believe it!
My flying machine it worked!
Sherman, you're the first
flying man!
You should be very proud,
Peabody!
Very very proud.
“proud” doesn’t begin to describe it.
Leonardo, will you please fire up the mechanism?
papa, mama!
Mona!
papa, mama!
I'm sorry I broke the plane, Mr. Peabody.
Well, you Should be.
You could have been killed.
What are you talking about?
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!
Sherman destroyed a priceless historical artifact.
Whatever.
You should be happy.
It turns out that
Sherman is not a complete and total loser after all.
Yes, Mr. Peabody.
Turns out that I'm not a complete and total loser after all.
Miss Peterson...
... Stop turning my son
Into a hooligan.
It’s not my fault he is a hooligan.
Yeah. It’s not her fault I'm a hooligan.
Well it’s certainly not my fault.
I spent the last 7 years...
... teaching  Sherman good judgment.
If you are such a great parent,
why is Miss Grunion trying to take Sherman away from you?
Is that true?
Is somebody gonna take me away from you?
No, Sherman.
I’ll never let that happen.
You just need to trust me.
Oh dear, a Black Hole!
What’s happening?
If I cannot pull us out of here
...
... we are going to be smashed
to smithereens on the horizon.
There’s not enough power to resist the gravitational pole.
I've got to burn everything...
Why didn’t you tell me?
Tell you what?
Why didn’t you tell me that Miss Grunion
was trying to take me away from you?
It’s not your job to worry about these things.
You just didn’t think I could handle it...
We will discuss later.
Now sit down.
I do not want to discuss it later!
Sherman, sit.
You can’t talk to me Like that.
I'm not a dog.
What did you say?
I said I'm not dog!
You're right, Sherman,
you're not.
you're Just a very bad boy.
T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...
... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Sherman? Penny?
Sherman, are you okay?
Sherman?
He’s Gone.
Where are we, anyway?
Oh ,No.
We are on the brink
one of the most brutal conflicts in history.
How are we doing heroes of Greece?
Feel good?
Feel strong?
Okay, let's get warmed up,
if we are to succeed
something out there.
Remember what happened to Achilles,
and whole thing with his heel.
You look fine, Diomedes.
Menelaus, my man!
my man.
Are you ready to get on the field ,
Shermanous?
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon!
That’s cute.
Odysseus, what news do you bring?
Someone left this for us.
A present, nice!
It looks just like our horse.
Should I bring it inside?
I’d be rude not to.
I did not see that coming.
Jeez louise!
What is that smell?
Ohh-huh This is the smell of victory!
Greetings , men of Athens,
Sparta and Thebes.
Peabody here.
I‘ve come for Sherman.
Do you know this guy?
I thought I did,
but now I’m not so sure.
They must be spy.
Kill him!
No, no!
He is... my dad.
Your dad?
It’s an adoptive relationship.
Thank you
For taking such good care of my son, Agamemnon...
... But it's time for him to come home.
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I‘ve joined the Greek army.
The Shermanous is one of us now.
- He's a brother.
- I’m his brother.
He’s my son!
- He took an oath!
- I took an oath.
He’s seven!
…and a half!
All sons must prove
themselves to their fathers.
Today,
Shermanous will prove himself on the field of battle.
But he’s only a child.
Your dad may not think …
you're ready to become a man,
Shermanous...
... but we do.
Yes, Mr. Peabody.
Now
I will show you what I can handle.
FYI...
... alot of heroes have father issues.
My old man is a Minotaur.
Half man-half bull.
All judgment.
Ajax here,
is the strongest guy in the world...
... but his father never accepted...
... that his real dream was to sing.
I wanted to be in the Greek chorus.
And don’t even get me distorted about Oedipus.
Let’s just say that,
You do not want to be in his house over the holidays.
It’s awkward.
Sherman,
I’m concerned you haven’t thought this through.
this is a war.
Do you realize what about to happen?
I'll tell you what's going to happen.
We’re gonna destroy their houses...
... pull down their temples...
... And makes the streets of the city
One red!
With Trojan blood!
Yeah!
Blood, blood, blood!
Zeus on 3!
one...
Sherman,
I absolutely forbid you to fight in the Trojan War.
That’s not fair!
All my friends are fighting in the Trojan War.
two...
- Sherman it‘s dangerous!
- I’ wearing a helmet.
-three!
- You’re not going!
Oh , yes. I am.
Zeus!
Eat my bronze,
You Trojan dogs!
Eat my bronze,
You Trojan dogs!
Well , that’s cutting it close.
This is why I ask you to obey me,
Sherman.
Because I'm your father.
And it’s my job to keep you safe.
But Are you sure Miss Grunion, will take me away?
Not as long as I’m around.
Mr. Peabody, help me!
Penny!
Smell my victory!
Smell it!
That's my ride!
Mr. Peabody hurry!
I'll take that.
You did it, Sherman!
Mr. Peabody helped.
Now, let's get
To the WABAC  ...
... go home , unhypnotise Penny’s parents...
... Finish that dinner party
Eat my baked alaska...
... charm the pants off Miss Grunion...
... and make sure none of
This ever happens in the place.
Sounds good.
I ‘m in.
Sherman !
Penny!
Sherman, no!
Mr. Peabody...
Mr. Peabody?
Mr. Peabody!
Dad!
Oh , Mr. Peabody, what should I do?
What should I do?
There is nothing you can do, Sherman.
I just want to go home...
Home?
That’s it!
I‘ve got an idea.
Come on!
Where we gonna go?
We’re going  home.
There’s
only one person who can help us...
... and that’s Mr. Peabody.
What are you talking about?
This is not possible.
We’ve got a Time Machine,
Penny.
I can set it so that
We get home...
... when Mr. Peabody is still there.
But I thought you’re not suppose
to go back to a time when you existed.
What choice do we have?
ERROR
You are attempting to travel to an era in which you exist.
This could alter the fabric of space-time.
ERROR
Hang on!
This is a little home-spun concoction
I’d like to call:
" Einstein on the beach".
- To the kids.
- To the kids!
Mr. Peabody!
Sherman? Penny?
Can we talk to you a second?
Of Course.
Excuse me.
I’ve really hit it off with your parents.
I think we can file this night under
"unqualified success".
- I’d hold off filing it just yet.
- What do you mean?
Why are you dressed like ancient...
... Greeks?
You use the WABAC!
I did.
I know it's terrible.
But why?
Penny and I got into an argument about
George Washington.
So I made him show me
the WABAC.
And I lost her in Ancient Egypt.
And got engaged King TuT.
So I came back and got you.
We ran out of gas.
In Florence.
And went into a black hole.
And then you died in Ancient Troy.
Died?
I have a hard believing that.
It’s True!
But now you're here,
and everything’s gonna be ok!
I told you never to
Come back to a time when you existed...
... because there will be two of you.
Yes, but the other  one of me
is in Ancient Egypt.
Who are you?
He’s you, but from another timeline.
But I thought you said,
never to come back to a time when you existed.
Exactly!
I know, I know.
But what was I supposed to do?
Mr. Peabody died
In Ancient Troy.
Died?
I have a hard time believing that.
Thank you!
What are we going to do?
well, for starter , both Sherman can’t stay here.
Why? We can bump it!
or think at the same thing!
That’s so weird. It’s like we are twins.
I was thinking that too.
see?!
We can’t have two Shermans
In the same timeline.
it put too much strength on the space time continuum.
What to do?
What to do...
The Peterson
Can’t know  any of this.
- Hey, Peabody!
- Hey!
How's it going?
Paddy and I are working on our appetite.
What the
smells coming from your kitchen are yummy!
Especially  that baked alaska!
Yeah... So, what's going on here?
Yes, what are these cloaks?
Toga party!
Toga party?
Yes, it is a toga party!
But what about dinner?
I’m Starving.
Why not go to the dining room...
... and talking those quails
You’ve been talking about?
- No!
- Why not?
Because... it's so fun right here.
Miss Grunion !
How delightful!
We were having such a good time,
I almost forgot you’re coming.
Why don’t you join the party?
Stop , I’m not here for a party!
I’m here for the investigation.
good! Why don’t you start investigating
over  here?
Or here... or here... or here...
stop waving your hands around!
Sherman?
Wait!
Is that...
-... Sherman!
duo  Shermanous?
What is going on here, Peabody?
Nobody move!
Sherman, I’ve got to get you out of here...
... before you touch yourself.
Mr. Peabody, you didn’t die!
- Of course I didn’t!
- Thank you!
How did you get back?
After a few failed experiments...
... I had  upon a combination of bone, stone and
Yak fat ...
... And constructed a rudimentary
WABAC.
You know what they say...
... if at first you don’t succeed,
try, and try again.
This is no time for
puns!
Even good ones.
Penny, Sherman quickly.
You’re not going anywhere.
I’ve seen quit enough to remove the boy...
... both boys,
From this home.
No, do not!
Miss Grunion  please!
This is All my fault.
I started it.
I'm so sorry, Sherman.
You have nothing to apologize for, Penny.
A dog should never’ve been allowed to adopt a boy
In the first place.
- Now, come on!
- Miss Grunion, becareful!
What’s happening?
Mr. Peabody! Help !
Sherman?
Hey, where did the other two go?
Our cosmic doubles combined,
In order to reconcile
in space-time continuum.
Okay, that make sense.
I do not know what just happened,
but I know it was wrong!
This boy is coming with me!
Mr. Peabody!
- No, Miss Grunion!
- oh you’re hurting me!
Get back here!
Oh , you’re hurting me!
He Bit me!
He Bit me!
Yes, Hello, police?
I’ like to report an assault.
a bite!
Mr. Peabody, what are we gonna do?
Yes, yes, that’s right.
Get here as soon as possible.
Run!
He’s kidnapping children!
I can’t believe you bit her, Mr. Peabody.
I know, Sherman. It was wrong.
Wrong? It was awesome!
And now to return to our proper
timeline...
... and erase  this mess.
There he is!
He’s got my daughter,
in this gigantic space apple!
My face is numb.
What’s wrong?
Time Travel failed.
Oh dear...
What is it, Mr. Peabody?
Our cosmic doubles colliding ripped the whole in
The space-time continuum.
That’s why we didn’t get to the past.
Hi, Peabody!
Looks like the past is
coming to us.
I will get you, dog!
Penny, my bride!
What?
Oh dear! oh dear
Follow that orb.
I’m Coming!
What sort of creature are you?
The name’s Grunion!
I'm in love!
I just need to find a wormhole.
Hey , Einstein, it’s the red light.
Hey ,I’m walking here.
Cake!
Here they go! Don’t lose them!
I’m trying to find another wormhole...
... But they all lead back to the present.
Time Travel failed.
Time Travel failed.
There  he is!
after them!
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.
We’re coming  Shermanous!
Time Travel failed.
Mr. Peabody, look out!
Shermanous, hold on.
We shall release you from this egg.
drop the saber,
And step away from the futuristic orb.
I take orders from no man!
liberté , égalité , fraternité !
Don’t tase me, bro.
Come out, Peabody,
With the paws in the air.
Mr. Peabody  , you are under arrest...
...for kidnapping, reckless endangerment...
... and a multiplicity of major traffic violations!
You don’t understand.
There ‘s a rip in the space-time continuum.
If you arrest me, I won’t be able to fix
...
For too long you've bamboozled the world ...
... with your fancy jargon
and that little red tie of yours. ..
... and look what’s come of it.
Take him away!
Wait.
- Mr. Peabody!
- Sherman!
What’s gonna happen to Mr. Peabody?
Don’t you know what
happens to dogs that bite?
Let me go.
You don’t know what you’re doing.
Please,
before it's too late!
Wait!
Give him another chance!
He is through with chances.
Now
He has to pay for his mistakes.
But
I'm the one who made all the mistakes.
I'm the one who used the WABAC
without permission.
The only mistake Mr. Peabody ever made...
... was me.
Sherman!
You're absolutely right, Sherman.
What kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy?
Maybe you're right, Miss Grunion...
... but there’s one thing you haven’t considered.
What’s that?
I'm a dog too!
If being a dog means
You’re like Mr. Peabody...
... who never turns his back on you...
... and who’s  always there to
pick you up when you fall...
... And loves you,
No matter how many times you mess up...
... if that what it means to be a dog...
... then yeah.
I’M A DOG TOO!
I'm a dog too!
I'm a dog too!
I'm a dog too!
I'm a dog too!
I'm a dog as well! A poodle dog!
I am a dog too.
Did the one that dog thing.
- I'm a dog too!
- I.
I'm a dog too.
I’m Spartacus.
alright, fine.
You are all dogs.
But You can’t change the law.
I know someone who can.
George Washington!
We hold these truths to be self-evident.
That all men,
and some dogs...
... Are created equal.
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.
Me too.
I've done worse.
Mr. Peabody, look!
It’s getting closer!
What are we going to do?
This is the greatest collection of
geniuses, ever assembled.
Surely we can come up with another way of
getting to the past.
I gonna built a catapult.
Then we go very fast!
But remember as you
approach the speed of light...
... gravity will get too strong.
And indeed, for every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction.
How about we just punch
That big hole, in the face.
I have an idea.
Hey, everybody!
I have an idea!
Yes what is it, Sherman?
Why not go to the future?
the future?
I have never been there before.
So, it’s probably not as messed up.
Sherman, that’s it!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Not usually.
It's exactly what you all just said!
Except the total opposite!
If we set the WABAC to the future...
... and go very very fast...
... we’ll create our own gravitational field ...
... that’s equal and opposite...
... to the rip in the space-time continuum!
I don’t get it...
We’re gonna Fly up there,
and punch that big hole in the face.
Yes!
Sherman, you're a genius!
But , Peabody,
how far in the future must you go?
just a few seconds are to do it.
And then we’ll sling shut right back!
Are you sure this is going to work?
Do not worry, Penny.
Just remember, I'm...
... genius!
Sherman,
I need to reprogram the WABAC.
alright, Mr. Peabody.
That means you have to drive.
In order to make the leap into the future...
... the WABAC have to go very fast.
Faster than has ever gone before.
Are you Ready, Sherman?
I’m ready.
Come on, Sherman,
you can do it.
Now, Mr. Peabody?
Sherman, we need more speed.
Now?
Just a Little more.
Not yet, Sherman.
Not yet.
Now!
Farewell!
- Everybody addio !
- papa, mama.
Goodbye!
Abschied
You haven’t seen the last of me, Peabody!
You’ll make a mistake ensurely,
and when you do...
... I'll be there!
This is mine!
Come on, Sherman. Come on!
Yeah!
If you want to watch television before
I get home...
... simply press the input 3 times...
... and then use the
remote control as usual.
yes, Sherman.
And if you worried about making friends
at the  PTA meeting...
... consider bringing snacks
for everyone.
The are always appreciated.
yes, Sherman.
And remember, Mr. Peabody...
... I have  club after school today.
Sherman, wait.
Yes, Mr. Peabody?
Hey, Mr. Peabody.
Hey, Sherman.
Wait up!
no doubt about it:
Every dog should have a boy.
I know pronounce you husband and wife!
You may kiss the Grunion.
Come here, soldier!
