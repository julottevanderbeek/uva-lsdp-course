You know
how in some movies...
they have a dream sequence,
only they don’t tie you
it’s a dream?
This is so not a dream.
It wasn’t supposed to
be Like this.
I was just trying to do my job,
and then things happened.
Weir, Life happened.
And now I’m here.
Catch a failing star
and put it in your pocket...
Catch a failing star
and put it in your pocket...
Trust me.
I´m not the kind of girI...
who does things Iike this.
I mean, two months ago,
you couIdn´t have picked
me out of a crowd.
Hi. CaII me.
ToId you.
I´m over there.
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.
Standard British caIIsfor ´"re.´"
So unIess you´re
a pompous American,
I wouId go with ´"er.´"
I had my own office,
unIimited stationary suppIies,
and a professionaI,
dedicated assistant.
Thought of this
awesome new phrase.
"Power is powerfuI.´"
TotaI T-shirt, right?
Awesome. Amazing. What?
Can I get my messages?
-Yeah.
Hey, seriousIy,
Iast time I saw you,
did I Iook fat?
OK. You hesitated.
No. Case cIosed. Forget it.
-Excuse me, Merkin.
Um, I noticed that there
weren´t any index cards.
I can´t do notes without them.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Merkin ain´t jerkin´.
He´s workin´, OK?
Take that to the bank.
It´s power, baby. It´s power.
My boss.
No. I´m just a IittIe tense.
I mean, this whoIe office
is not Feng Shui.
AII the desks are facing,
Iike, eviI, you know?
Uh, do you think I shouId
bIeach my jeans...
Josie!
Guess who I did it with
Iast night.
Roger from op/ed?
Ohh! Who toId you?
You did. You said yesterday,
and I quote,
´"I have a date with Roger
from op/ed tonight,
and I´m gonna do it
with him.´"
Computer´s down.
SeptupIet story.
Need it by 5:00.
HopefuIIy the copy´s
not a mess.
It´s ´"hoped´"
that it´s not a mess.
´"HopefuIIy´" is an adverb.
It means ´"with hope.´"
You have it
defining the copy,
and I´m pretty sure the copy
doesn´t have feeIings.
So, Anita...
You and Roger in op/ed.
Oh, man, who toId you?
Roger in op/ed.
-ReaIIy?
Anita?
-What?
Don´t make me
send you another memo...
about my poIicy
on interoffice dating.
It´s ´"intraoffice dating.´"
And they´re not dating.
They´re having sex.
Oh.
And what exactIy is
your poIicy, Augustus?
That if you´re not getting any,
then no one can?
Hmm.
How many times have I fired her?
Five or six.
-Eight.
Gus...
Did you get those story ideas
that I Ieft on your desk?
Morning, Mr. Strauss.
Yes, the bIind
foster home mother.
That was good.
I got Kahune on it.
Oh, yeah. Kahune. He´s good.
GeIIer, we´ve been through this.
You´re a great copy editor.
You´re maybe
my best copy editor.
You´re not a reporter.
You´ve used 5 of my ideas.
Gus, pIease.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry
thinks he can write,
but a journaIist gets in there
where the bombs are faIIing.
He´s aggressive.
He grabs the buII by the baIIs.
You don´t think I can
grab a buII´s baIIs?
GeIIer, you don´t want
a reporter´s Iife.
Trust me. They´re very messy,
and you´re aII about
order and controI,
and getting me my copy by 5:00.
I can be out of controI.
Copy by 5:00!
Josie,
maybe Gus has a point.
You know, it´s not gonna kiII
you to reIax and have some fun.
Hey, you know, Roger´s got
this friend MarshaII in editing.
Maybe we can aII go on
a doubIe date or something.
MarshaII the duke?
I swear to God, Josie! Come on!
TeII me, when is the Iast time
that you went on a reaI date?
I´m concentrating
on my career right now.
Do you own
any coIored underwear?
Stripes or anything?
The right guy, he´s out there.
I´m just not gonna go kiss
a whoIe bunch of Iosers...
to get to him.
Yeah, but you know what?
Sometimes kissing Iosers
can be a reaIIy fun diversion.
When I finaIIy get kissed,
I´II know.
OK. If you´ve never
kissed a guy before,
we have bigger probIems
than the underwear.
I´ve kissed a guy.
I´ve kissed guys.
I just...
haven´t feIt that thing.
That thing?
Is that what you kids
caII it these days?
That thing.
That moment
when you kiss someone,
and everything around you
becomes hazy...
and the onIy thing infocus
is you and this person...
and you reaIize that
that person...
is the onIy person that
you´re supposed to kiss...
for the rest of your Iife.
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift,
and you wanna Iaugh,
and you wanna cry...
´Cause you feeI so Iucky
that you found it
and so scared that it´II go away
aII at the same time.
Damn, girI. You are a writer.
OK...finished.
What do you guys think?
Where do you think it shouId go?
The bedroom?
That´s exactIy
what I was thinking.
When I say that I´m OK
WeII, they Iook at me
kind of strange
Perfect.
SureIy you´re
not happy now
You no Ionger pIay the game
The meeting just began.
Let me start by saying
I was very impressed...
with that investigative
piece that Dutton did...
on pesticides
in our supermarkets.
But since the Trib did a piece
on the same subject onIy better,
you´refired.
Dutton, did you hear me?
You´refired.
Out, out, out.
CIose your cubicIe.
Bye-bye, Dutton.
HeIIo, everybody eIse
stiII working here.
Let´s ceIebrate by doing
another undercover feature.
Now, you know that my
inspiration for these stories...
come, of course,
from my personaI Iife.
I mean, who wouId´ve thought
that my foray into hair pIugs...
wouId´ve resuIted
in Iast month´s cover story?
´"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow.´"
A great story.
So anyway, Iast night,
I´m sitting home with
my famiIy having dinner...
Roger.
And my younger boy
starts to choke.
And I reaIized that my son
was aIIergic to peanuts.
I said to myseIf, ´"HoIy shit!
I don´t even know my own kids.´"
How much do we know about
these high schooI kids?
What are they thinking?
And then it hit me.
Boom!
´"My Semester in High SchooI.´"
You.
What´s your name?
-Josie.
Jose?
Josie GeIIer.
Josie GeIIer,
you enroII Friday.
Have fun.
The meeting just ended.
Josie!
Freaked the yogi right out.
Excuse me.
Josie.
Ohh...
It´s reaIIy happening!
My first undercover feature
by Josie GeIIer!
Josie, maybe you shouId
turn it down.
Why? You don´t think
I can do it?
No, no! It´s just...
This is a Iot of pressure for
your first piece, that´s aII.
I mean, this is not
a haIf-a-page articIe.
This is a major
undercover piece, OK?
Look what Rigfortjust
did to Dutton in there,
and that guy´s his cousin.
Don´tworry.
I´m gonna straighten
this aII out.
Neither of you guys
think I can do this?
That´s notwhat
we´re saying, Josie.
Anita, when you wanted to
seduce the guy in the maiIroom,
and you thought you couIdn´t
Iearn Spanish fast enough,
who quizzed you on your verbs?
Senorita Josie.
And, Gus, when you wanted
to Iearn how to knit,
who showed you how
to work the needIes?
Um, you did.
You knit?
-Yeah.
So this is my chance.
WeII, I´m not hoIding
your job for you, GeIIer.
Thankyou!
-OK.
Don´t make me give you my memo
on interoffice hugging, OK?
Now comes the hard part.
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 17 again.
OK, what´s the first
thing you´re gonna need?
You want Bambi? No way.
Rob, pIease.
Why don´t you just
borrow Mom´s car?
I can´t use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.
Ha ha.
-A vintage cIassic.
It´s just for
a coupIe of months.
A coupIe of months is
Iike 10 years in Bambi Iife.
It´s so weird that you
name your cars.
Why? Guys name
their penises.
OK.
You can have my
Buick La Sabre...
and name it anything you want.
ReaIIy?
La Sabre.
Nah. I don´t think so.
FuIIy Ioaded.
Maybe.
Are those shorts or a skirt?
They´re gaucho pants.
I got them on saIe.
AIoha! WeIcome!
Every customer gets afree Iei.
ReIax, Vaughn.
It´s just my sister.
AIoha, my ass.
Shake it easy, buddy.
Hey, Rob, have you taIked
to the admissions Iady...
from Lakeshore
Community CoIIege yet?
No.
But you couId start
before next semester.
You couId even taIk to her
about a basebaII schoIarship.
It´s too Iate, Josie,
you know?
I´m not going to coIIege.
I´m not pIaying basebaII
anymore.
This is my Iife.
This is a Iuau that seIIs
packing materiaI.
You had such a shot
at pIaying coIIege baII.
You Iet a case of mono stop you.
Don´t you wanna move out
of Mom and Dad´s?
Pay your own biIIs?
Why? So I can be
as happy as you?
I am happy.
Besides...
You are Iooking at the newest
undercover reporter...
forthe Chicago Sun-Times.
I am Josie GeIIer,
high schooI student,
Senior CIass 1999.
Uh-uh.
You´re kidding, right?
What?
-Do you remember high schooI?
It was a Iong time ago.
Do you remember what they
caIIed you in high schooI?
Josie Grossy!
Josie...
Josie Grossy.
I know. I made it up.
I didn´t know it was
gonna catch on Iike it did.
Josie...
What´s the matter?
You Iook nauseous.
Nauseated...I Iook nauseated.
Hi, BiIIy.
Um, I noticed that you weren´t

Josie, in my cIassroom,
tardiness is unacceptabIe.

So weIcome to Shakespeare´s
As You Like It.
Here. We can share.
...is an exampIe
of Shakespearean....
pastoraI comedy.

No, Sarah. That´s, uh...

Uh, but it´s cIose.
Parakeet?
OK. Anyone eIse?
Josie.
PastoraI means
set in the country,

It´s from the Latin

Are you sure you´re 17?
Yes.
I´m 17.
I´m 17.
Of course.
Excuse me. Ahem.

Josie, I toId you.
Bambi´s a cheap reguIar girI.
Wait a second.
Everything is fine, Rob.
I´II caII you Iater.
Josie, don´t hang up
They do it
to aII the new kids.
Who´s they?
Guy Perkins
and his amazing Iemmings.
They push your car out of
its space and hide it,
sit up there and watch
whiIe you Iook for it.
I´m AIdys.
-I´m Josie.
AIdys. That´s
an interesting name.
When it´s not yours.
My mom was going through
her HarIequin Romance phase.
TeII me about it.
Try being named after
a guitar-pIaying pussycat.
Never mind.
Listen, wouId you Iike
to waIk to Nano´s...
and get something to eat?
Yeah. That wouId be reaIIy nice.
So teII me, what are
your hopes and your dreams?
What do you want to be?
Thank you.
-You´re weIcome.
I want to be a professor
of medievaI Iiterature.
I want to be a noveIist.
I want to be a weekendfIautist.
I want to be a potter.
I want to be a painter.
I want to be an architect,
and I want to go
to Northwestern.
I went there!
For what?
Yes. Once to use
the bathroom.
Um, they have
a reaIIy nice faciIity.
Oh, my God.
HeIIo.
I got your message.
What the heII kind of story
are you pitching?
It´s my dad. He worries.
-Yeah. Mine, too.
Yeah, hi, Dad.
I miss you, too.
You´re one sick puppy,
you know that, GeIIer?
It´s an exposé
on cafeteria food.
Let me guess.
You´re Ieading with the terribIe
truth about coIe sIaw.
WeII, the buIk of it wiII
be about the pimento Ioaf.
GeIIer, you wanna be
a reporter?
Take a Iook at what seIIs.
Sex scandaIs, bribery,
peopIe jumping off buiIdings.
So, unIess some kid
just kiIIed himseIf...
because he was being paid...
to have sex with
the schooI mascot...
in a big vat of that coIe sIaw,
you got nothing.
CaII me when you do.
They Iove to
disconnect the battery, too.
Here. Just so
that you know,
I think they recaIIed
these cars in 1974.
Yeah, thanks.
-Sure. No probIem.
Josie, I was wondering...
How are you at caIcuIus?
I´m good.
How wouId you Iike
to join the Denominators?
We have these reaIIy fun
pizza study groups,
and we go to these
aII-county meets.
And not that you need it,
and I don´t wanna sound
Iike the Godfather,
but we couId offer you
a certain amount of protection,
if you know what I mean.
Sounds great.
´"AII the worId´s
a stage,
and aII the men and women,
mereIy pIayers.´"
Does anyone know what
Shakespeare meant by that?
Anyone?
It´s about disguise.
About pIaying a part.
And that´s the theme
of As You Like It.
Now, does anyone know
where we can see this?
Oh.
WeII, RosaIind disguises
herseIf as a man,
and then she escapes
into the forest.
Right. And it´s when
she´s in costume...
that she canfinaIIy express
her Iove for OrIando.
See, the point Shakespeare
is trying to make...
is that when we´re
in disguise, we feeI freer.
We do things we wouIdn´t
do in ordinary Iife.
Brett, what happens when you
go out on a footbaII fieId...
in uniform?
We kick ass!
Yeah!
You yeII.
You hit peopIe.
You touch other guys´ butts.
It´s OK, it´s OK
´cause you´re in uniform.
See, disguise
changes aII the ruIes.
I tells you a story
My first season as a pee wee hockey
Well, honestly... I-I was terrible,
I couldn't stay, I was afraid... I was afraid to hit the head
My dad, my dad bougth me this brand new helmet...
sign by Gordie Howe
Come on guys... Gordie Howe!
Ok, he was like... like the Tiger Woods of hockey
Every time I'd put on this helmet... I mean... I'd feel invincible
I'd skied harder, I'd shaken people left and right
I'd even got out of a game once for fight
The point here is that disguise can be liberate,
can you get to do things that you never thougt possible
And for Rosalind, her male costume,
opens the possibilities for the great love of her life
Josie, why don't you read from Act 5,
Scene 2, Rosalind's speech--
No sooner had they met but they looked;
no sooner looked but they loved;
no sooner loved but they sighed..."
Does he notice me?
Does he hear my heart screaming his name--
sometimes it's so loud
I think the Gods can hear my pain.
His voice is so mellifluous,
oh to get just one kiss.
O.K., what have you wanted for like ever
but you didn't think it would -ever happen?
I'm the most popular girl in school,
and Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Yes.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to the prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem!
I knew he liked the poem!
Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That's what I'm saying.
Oh my God!
I am actually speechless, I have no words!
That's never happend to me ever in my life
O.K. - hey just a reminder.
Your paper is due next week.
Hey guys!. This is Cindy Anakowski student body's president...
Don't forget, don't going to the library,there is this asphalt problem
Excuse me, can I open my locker .Now, about prom.
Voting about the Prom theme has been completed
and the theme is... The Millenium!!
- Rufus! Prom is gonna be Rufus.
- What's Rufus?
It's my new cool hippie word.
Spread it around like wild fire
Right! Rufus!
What is with this school and prom?
Southglen South competes every year for best prom...
...the theme is everthing darling
So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
"There's a land that I see where the children are free
Come with me, take my hand, and we'll live
...In a land where the river runs free
In a land through the green country
And you and me are free to be you and me...
What's that?
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court".
Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Hey! Albo, the dog park is that way. Go!
Last I checked--this was still a free country
You  aren't seriously trying to hang out at
The Court, aren't you, Albo?
Oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan.
Where do I sign up?
Why don't you go home, figure around
oh your calculator, whatever is that you use it.
Figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
can you , Josie? It's lame.
All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
- Yeah, it seems lame.
- Yeah, it's very lame
You say that!
The Court? Josie, I am appalled
Jeez, I know, I mean... who knows that these kids-
No, I am appalled because I have a reporter in there,
undercover, for almost three weeks now-
and I had to read about this in the Tribune.
You're right.
I can fold!
Seventeen-year-old Kristen David says,
"Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
S-S-She's right.
I have learned that it is a popular place for the kids to go.
This is where the stories are.
You become friends with these people.
You are party with them.
You 'll rave with them gett chicky with them.
When they go to prom...
you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Gus listen, the popular kids and I...
Do you even know these kids?
They hid my car--
By the way, it's depend, because there is no s.
Your subject is plural
Out!
Come on! Asses and elbows!
The news doesn't sleep, you know!
Yeah, baby!
Do this with mum and dad
No. They're still caring to do Franklin
meet Pat at dinner. But I made a pizza.
- I can't do it
What? Damn, these are high schools girls?
We've got some underage hotties on our hands
Gus wants me to be friends with these people.
The popular kids. It's impossible.
Why is that impossible?
You don't know how it was for me back in high school.
All I wanted was to be accepted...
and they just tortured me.
I can't go back to Southglen South.
You're at Southglen South?
They have a killer baseball team.
Focus, please
okay,okay , You're an adult now, Josie.
You're successful,
you've graduated at the top of your class,
you work for a newspaper...
you wash your hair now--
you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Don't you know how much I
wanted to be you in high school?
Just for one day to know what
it was like to be popular?
It's not that hard, Josie.
All you need is the right person.
One person that thinks
you're cool and you're in.
Everyone else will be
too scared to question it.
Is that true?
Yeah, it's a little known fact
Don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself-
Don't you wanna show them that
the cool kids don't freak you out anymore?
That you can go in there, you can be friends with them,
and get your story?
Yes, desperately
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me
Better than I...
That's the spirit!
So let hear it, come on:
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"
That's it. Now scream it!
"I'm not Josie Grossie anymore"!!!
That's good!
Josie... and the pussy cats
George?! What are you doing here?
In the van, go, go...
Welcome to the love hut
Oh right...
George, what is going on?
What are you doing?
Hidden camera
- Wings?
- Yeah...
That's great but...
I really just talk to Gus about this first
Geller, stop being a pain in the ass
Gus?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz.
Now look--you're in over your head.
This is how it's gonna work.
I review the tapes, I find your story.
Battery, transmitter
Man!
Here we go....Good luck sweet!
George. why are you so cool?
Work, herbs, berries... you know
I'll be watching you
Oh, right. Lets get this party start it
Oh! Damn!
They weren't such good when I was at high school
Hey! Kirsten, Kristen, Gibby--
What's up girlfriends?
- I'm ok
- Uh! That's gonna leave a mark
And so it is Rosalind, in disguise,
who is best able to see through the disguises of others.
To say to Phebe, "Mistress, know thy self,"
to look at love from every angle,
and to realize, finally,
that she is in love with Orlando--
To free both hearts not in judgment but in equality

Love. Who knows what that is?

- I just did
Jos, this's it. This is my ninth inning!
The game isn't over--I just thought it was!
You see, I get on the Southglen baseball team,
the right scout sees me--
I'm into the minors-it's game time!
- But you're twenty-three years old!
- Yeah, with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old!
Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular...
I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hear one
- Whatever
- This is so like you. You know, you can't just come
in here and be popular in just one day
Rob!Rob!Rob!Rob Rob!................
I'm the cabbage's salad king of the world
Dude, you did rock, man!
So hot!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and
I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Cool!
Josie?
Where were you last night?
I was really worried
What?
You know, last night. 7:30 Nana's?
I kept calling you, but I just got your machine.
I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
I'm sorry, I must forgot
Well, maybe you should forget about sitting with us too
Oh rigth. Let's get some money for the prom!!
- Where's your partner?
I don't have one--
I GOT A LONELY RIDE IN BUCKET SEVEN!
- SINGLE!
- Do you have to yell like that?
Sure I do
Is this seat taken?
Thank you
- Thank you
- Welcome
Are you--scared?
I'm gonna tell you something here,
and I hope it doesn't undermine my position
as an authority figure but... eh...
I'm a little afraid of heights.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel
Actually, it's
more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me
If better if you have your Gordie Howe's helmet on it...
you feel better
You remember that story?
I remember everything that you say
in your classroom
If the bucket's a-rockin',
don't come-a knockin'
- Boys
- Yeah
Mr Coulson rocks my world!
You know, I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it,
but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Why do you do that?
I don't know.
And you know what's scary--when you get older...
it just gets more confusing.
I mean, you know Lara,
my girlfriend you met at the club
We went out for five years
and now she wants me to move to New York
And, you know, I mean... I should-should do it
You know make the commitment and grow up
I know we have our differences
You know, I shouldn't be talking about
this stuff with you. I'm sorry.
It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Yeah, same here
All I can tell you is that when you're my age...
the guys will be lined up around the block for you
You have to say that because you're my teacher.
Actually I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher
