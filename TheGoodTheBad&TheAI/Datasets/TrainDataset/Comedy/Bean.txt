to be my wife.
But don't let this distract you.
Our work is not done.
Where arewe today?
Kids are killing each other
inschool playgrounds.
Half nudewomen are on every
billboard and magazine cover.
Songs have more dirty words
than clean.
Andyet I'm the one
they call crazy.
They don't know anything.
Do you know what Isay?
Drop the pills andsmokes
and come up for air.
We haven't exceeded our
humanity, we've destroyed it.
Let me remindyou, children,
that God burned Sodom.
He burned Gomorra.
If theworld doesn't want to
listen towhat I have tosay...
thenwe're headedstraight back
into the fire, all of us.
So long as you all follow me,
not us.
There are few places left where
you canstillsee thestars.
Is thiswhat you
wanted toshow me?
.Would that be enough?
.Yes, of course.
Sorry, Maxwell. You're trying to
teach me and I'm missing it.
That's not it.
That's it.

from me to you.
Are youserious?
