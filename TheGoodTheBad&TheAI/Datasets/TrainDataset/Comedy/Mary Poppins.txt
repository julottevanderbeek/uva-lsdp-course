Now, how does that sound?
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you
Miss Lark likes to walk
in the park with Andrew.
Hello, Andrew.
AH, Mrs Cory
a story for you
Your daughters
were shorter than you...
but they grew.
Dear Miss Persimmon--
Yes?
Wind´s in tHe east
Mist comin´ in.
Like sometHing is brewin´
About to begin
Can´t put me finger
on wHat lies in store
But I feel what´s to happen...
all happened before.
I´m sorry. Where was I?
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.
Crikey. Bless you, guv.
Generosity itself,
that´s what you are.
No charge.
Oh, it´s you! Hello.
Number 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?
All right.
Come along with me.
This here´s Cherry Tree Lane.
Nice little spot,
you might say.
Number 1 7´s just down a bit.
Now, this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye...
is the home
of Admiral Boom...
late of His Majesty´s Navy.
Likes his house
shipshape, he does...
shipshape and bristol fashion
at all times.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.
What he´s famous for
is punctuality.
The whole world takes
its time from Greenwich.
But Greenwich, they say, takes
its time from Admiral Boom.
What cheer, Admiral?
Good afternoon to you,
young man. Where are you bound?
Number 1 7. Got some parties here
in tow what wants to see it.
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.
A word of advice, young man:
Storm signals are up
at Number 1 7.
Bit of heavy weather
brewing there.
Thank you, sir.
Keep an eye skinned.
Here we are.
Number 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane.
Residence of
George Banks, Esquire.
Hello, hello, hello.
The Admiral´s right.
Heavy weather brewin´
at Number 1 7, and no mistake.
- Leave her alone!
- Shut up!
I´ll show you. Don´t you be trying
to stop the wretched creature!
Let her go, that´s what I say,
and good riddance!
I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.
But who gets stuck with
the children with no nanny
in the house? Me, that´s who!
Her and her high
and mighty ways!
And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn´t
stay in this house another minute...
not if you heap me with
all the jewels in Christendom.
No, no, Katie Nanna, don´t go!
Stand away from that door,
my girl!
But what am I gonna tell
the master about the children?
It´s no concern of mine.
Those little beasts have run
away from me for the last time.
They must be somewhere. Did you
look around the zoo in the park?
You know how Jane
and Michael is.
Coo! You don´t think the lion
could´ve got at them, do ya?
You know how fond they was
of hangin´ around the cage.
I said my say,
and that´s all I´ll say.
I´ve done with this house forever.
Well, hip, hip, hooray!
And don´t stumble
on the way out, dearie.
Now, now, Katie Nanna!
Mrs Banks! She´s home!
Our daugHter´s daugHters will adore us
and we´ll sing in grateful cHorus
´´Well done,
Sister Suffragette´´
Good evening,
Katie Nanna, Ellen.
We had the most
glorious meeting!
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained
herself to the wheel of
the Prime Minister´s carriage.
- You should´ve been there.
- Mrs Banks, I would like
a word with you.
And Mrs Ainslie, she was
carried off to prison...
singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!
I´m glad you´re home, madam. I´ve
always given the best that´s in me--
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.
I always knew you were one of us.
We´re clearly soldiers
in petticoats
And dauntless crusaders
for women´s votes
THougH we adore men
individually
We agree tHat as a group
tHey´re ratHer stupid
- Mrs Banks.
- Cast off tHe sHackles of yesterday
SHoulder to sHoulder
into tHe fray
Our daugHter´s daugHters
will adore us
And tHey´ll sing
in grateful cHorus
´´Well done
Sister Suffragette´´
Being that as it may, I do not
wish to offend, but I--
From Kensington to Billingsgate
one Hears tHe restless cries
From every corner of tHe land
womankind arise
Political equality
and equal rigHts witH men
Take Heart for Mrs PankHurst
Has been clapped in irons again
No more tHe meek and mild
subservients we
We´re figHting for our rigHts
militantly
Never you fear
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.
- So cast off tHe sHackles of yesterday
- Mrs Banks!
And sHoulder to sHoulder
into tHe fray
Our daugHter´s daugHters
will adore us
And tHey´ll sing
in grateful cHorus
- ´´Well done´´
- Mrs Banks.
- ´´Well done´´
- Mrs Banks.
- ´´Well done, Sister Suf--´´
- Mrs Banks!
- What is it, Katie Nanna?
- Mrs Banks, I have something
to say to you.
- Where are the children?
- The children, madam...
to be precise,
are not here.
They´ve disappeared again.
Katie Nanna, this is really
too careless of you.
Doesn´t it make
the third time this week?
The fourth, madam. And I for one
have had my fill of it.
I´m not one to speak ill
of the children, but--
Oh, please, when do you
expect them home?
I really couldn´t say.
And now if you´d be good enough
to compute my wages, I´ll--
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You´re not
leaving? What will Mr Banks say?
He´s going to be cross enough
as it is to come home and find
the children missing.
Ellen, put these things away. You know
how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.
Yes, ma´am.
Katie Nanna, I beseech you.
Please reconsider.
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks.
He was just beginning
to get used to you.
Posts, everyone!
Four, three, two, one. Fire!
-Katie Nanna, I do beseech you--
-My wages, if you please.
Bit early tonight,
aren´t you, Admiral?
Nonsense.
Bang on the dot, as usual.
How are things in
the world of finance?
Never better. Money´s sound.
Credit rates are moving up, up, up.
And the British pound is
the admiration of the world.
- Good man.
- How do things look
from where you stand?
Bit chancy, I´d say.
The wind´s coming up
and the glass is falling.
- Don´t like the look of it.
- Good, good, good.
Banks, shouldn´t wonder if you weren´t
steering into a nasty piece of weather.
Banks! Do you hear me?
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy.
Allow me.
Hmph!
What a very pretty hat.
I feel a surge
of deep satisfaction
MucH as a king astride His noble steed
Thank you.
WHen I return from daily strife
to HeartH and wife
How pleasant is
tHe life I lead
- Dear, it´s about the children.
- Yes, yes, yes.
I run my Home
precisely on scHedule
At 6::0 1 I marcH
tHrougH my door
My slippers, sHerry and pipe

- George, they´re missing.
- Splendid. Splendid.
It´s grand to be
an EnglisHman in 1 9 1 0
King Edward´s on tHe tHrone
It´s tHe Age of Men
I´m tHe lord of my castle
THe sovereign, tHe liege

AH, lordly is
tHe life I lead
- Winifred, where are the children?
- They´re not here, dear.
What? Well, of course they´re here!
Where else would they be?
- I don´t know, George.
- You don´t know?
Well, they´re missing. Katie
Nanna has looked everywhere.
Very well. I´ll deal
with this at once.
Give me the police station,
quickly, please.
I don´t think we need bother the police,
dear. The facts of the matter--
Kindly do not attempt to
cloud the issue with facts.
One fact, and one fact alone
is crystal clear! Katie Nanna´s
faltered at her post.
She´s let the family down.
And I shall bring her to bo--
Oh. She´s left us,
hasn´t she?
Yes, dear, only just.
What, uh-- Yes.
George Banks here.
Yes. 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane.
It´s a matter of some urgency.
I should like you to send
a policeman around immediately.
The policeman´s here, George!
What? Oh, how very prompt.
What wonderful service.
Thank you so much. Good night.
- Come in, Constable. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.
While going about my duties
on the other side of the park...
I noted some valuables
that had gone astray.
- I believe they´re yours, sir.
- Valuables?
Come along, now. Come along.
Jane! Michael!
Winifred, please don´t
be emotional.
Oh, I wouldn´t be too hard on ´em, sir.
They´ve had a long, weary walk today.
Children, come here at once.
- Well?
- I´m sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- You see, it was windy.
- And the kite was too strong for us.
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the
kite that ran away, not the children.
Thank you, Constable.
I think I can manage this.
Actually it wasn´t a very good kite.
We made it ourselves.
Perhaps if you helped us
to make one--
Ah, that´s the ticket, sir.
Kites are skittish things.
Why, only last week with
me own youngsters--
I´m very grateful to you,
Constable, for returning the children.
And I´m sure that
if you go to the kitchen,
Cook´ll find you a plate of something.
Thank you, sir.
I shall now return to my duties.
Thank you, Constable.
Good night, miss. Good night, ma´am.
Good night, sir.
Cook´ll find me something.
I never--
I´m awfully sorry
about this, George.
I´ll expect you´ll want
to discuss it.
I would indeed!
Ellen, take Jane and Michael
upstairs straightaway.
Yes, sir.
I knew it. When all´s
said and done, who bears
the brunt of everything around here?
Me, that´s who!
They don´t want an honest,
hard-workin´ girl around here.
They need a ruddy zookeeper.
I´m sorry, dear, but when
I chose Katie Nanna...
I thought she would be
firm with the children.
She looked
so solemn and cross.
Winifred, never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.
I´ll try to do better next time.
Next time? My dear, you´ve engaged
six nannies in the last four months!
- And they´ve all been
unqualified disasters.
- I quite agree.
Choosing a nanny for the children
is an important and delicate task.
It requires insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.
Under the circumstances,
I think it might be apropos
to take it upon myself to, uh...
select the next person.
- Oh, would you, George?
- Obviously the way to find
a proper nanny...
is to go about it
in a proper fashion.
I shall put an advertisement in
the Times: Take this down please.
- Yes, of course, dear.
- Wanted.
Uh, no. Uh, required.
Nanny: firm, respectable,
no nonsense.
A BritisH nanny
must be a general
THe future empire
lies witHin Her Hands
And so tHe person tHat we need
to mould tHe breed
Is a nanny
wHo can give commands
- You getting this, Winifred?
- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.
A BritisH bank
is run witH precision
A BritisH Home
requires notHing less
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be tHe tools
WitHout tHem, disorder
catastropHe, anarcHy
In sHort you Have
a gHastly mess
Splendid, George! Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.
- Father?
- Yes?
We´ve discussed everything...
and we´re very sorry
about what we did today.
I should certainly think so.
- It was wrong to run away
from Katie Nanna.
- It was indeed.
And we do so want to get on
with the new nanny.
Very sensible. I shall be glad
to have your help in the matter.
We thought you would. That´s why
we wrote this advertisement.
- Advertisement for what?
- For the new nanny.
- You wrote an advert--
- George, I think we should listen.
- You said you wanted our help.
- But, I-- Oh, very well.
"Wanted: a nanny
for two adorable children.´´
"Adorable.´´ Well, that´s
debatable, I must say.
If you want tHis cHoice position
Have a cHeery disposition
-Jane, I don´t--
- Rosy cHeeks, no warts
- That´s the part I put in.
- Play games, all sorts
You must be kind
You must be witty
Very sweet
and fairly pretty
- Well, of all the ridic--
- George, please!
Take us on outings
Give us treats
Sing songs
Bring sweets
Never be cross or cruel
Never give us
castor oil or gruel
Love us as a son and daugHter
And never smell of barley water
I put that in too.
If you won´t scold
and dominate us
We will never you give you
cause to Hate us
We won´t Hide your spectacles
so you can´t see
Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea
Hurry, Nanny
Many tHanks
Sincerely
Jane and MicHael Banks
Thank you. Most interesting.
And now I think we´ve had
quite enough of this nonsense.
Please return
to the nursery.
They were only trying to help.
They´re just children.
I´m well aware they´re
just children, Winifred.
I only congratulate myself that
I decided to step in and take a hand.
"Play games, sing songs,
give treats.´´
Ridiculous. There´s no question
in my mind whatsoever.
Now is the time for action.
Give me the Times, please.
No, I do not know the number.
Oh, George, you´re always
so forceful.
The Times?
George Banks here.
an advertisement in your column.
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.
I´ll take the report,
Mr Binnacle.
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin´ in from a new quarter.
- So it is.
- Sir?
- What is it?
Bit of somethin´ or other
taking place off the port bow.
Ghastly looking crew,
I must say!
Coo! There´s a fair queue of nannies
outside, sir. Shall I show ´em in?
Ellen, I said 8:00, and
You see?
Twelve seconds to go.
- Ten, nine, eight--
- Posts!
Seven, six, five, four...
three, two, one!
Ellen, it is now 8:00.
Yes, sir.
But I have told you
time and time again, Ellen...
I dislike being hurried
into things.
I don´t understand. They´re not
what we advertised for at all.
Michael, look!
Perhaps it´s a witch.
Of course not.
Witches have brooms.
It´s her. It´s the person. She´s
answered our advertisement.
Rosy cheeks and everything.
Ellen, you may now show them in,
one at a time.
Yes, sir.
- You may come in one at a time.
- Thank you.
Oh.
You are the father of Jane
and Michael Banks, are you not?
I said, you are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks.
Well, well ye--
Yes, of course, I mean. Uh--
You brought your references,
I presume. May I see them?
Oh, I make it a point
never to give references.
A very old-fashioned idea
to my mind.
Is that so? We´ll have to see
about that then, won´t we?
Now then, the qualifications.
"Item one:
a cheery disposition.´´
I am never cross.
"Item two: rosy cheeks.´´
Obviously.
"Item three:
Play games, all sorts.´´
Well, I´m sure the children will find
my games extremely diverting.
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you
get it from? I thought I tore it up.
Excuse me. "Item four:
You must be kind.´´
I am kind,
but extremely firm.
- Have you lost something?
- Ah! Yeah.
That paper, you see.
I thought that I--
- You are George Banks, are you not?
- What?
And you did advertise
for a nanny, did you not?
- George Banks.
- Very well then.
I tore it up,
turned it over.
Tore it up again
and threw it in there. Yes.
I beg your pardon.
Are you ill?
I hope not.
Now, about my wages.
The reference here is very obscure.
- Very obscure.
- We must be very clear on
that point, mustn´t we?
- Yes, we must indeed.
- I shall require
every second Tuesday off.
Every Tuesday.
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.
Hmm. I´ll give you one week.
I´ll know by then.
I´ll see the children now.
Thank you.
Close your mouth please,
Michael. We are not a codfish.
Well, don´t stand there staring.
Best foot forward.
Spit spot!
- George?
- Aah!
George, what on earth
are you doing?
- I thought you were
interviewing nannies.
- I was! I was!
You mean you´ve
selected one already?
- Yes, it´s done. It´s, it´s all done.
- Well, where is she?
What? Well, eh, she´s in
the nursery of course, I mean.
-I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
-How clever of you!
I would have muddled
the whole thing.
Tell me, is she everything
that we´d hoped she´d be?
Well, i-it all happened rather
quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--
Will she be firm?
Will she give commands?
Will she mould our young breed?
You know, Winifred,
I think she will.
- I think she will.
- In that case...
perhaps you´d better tell Ellen
to dismiss the others.
- The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
- Y-Yes, sir?
Tell the other applicants they may go.
The position has been filled.
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.
How many nannies does she
think we need in this house?
The position
has been filled.
I´m afraid the nursery
isn´t very tidy.
It is rather like
a bear pit, isn´t it?
- That´s a funny sort of bag.
- Carpet.
- You mean to carry carpets in?
- No. Made of.
This is your room, and there´s
a lovely view of the park.
Hmm.
Well, it´s not exactly
Buckingham Palace.
Still, it´s clean.
Yes, I think it will be
quite suitable.
Just needs a touch
here and there.
Well, first things first.
I always say, the place
to hang a hat is on a hat stand.
Ah! This will never do!
I much prefer seeing
all of my face at the same time.
There-- But there was
nothing in it.
Never judge things
by their appearance.
Even carpetbags.
I´m sure I never do.
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.
We better keep an eye
on this one.
- She´s tricky.
- She´s wonderful.
Much better!
Now, let me see.
That´s funny. I always carry it with me.
It must be here somewhere.
- What?
- My tape measure.
- What do you want it for?
- I want to see how you two measure up.
Well, that´s the funniest thing I ever
saw. I know it´s down here somewhere.
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha!
Here it is.
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.
Head up, Michael. Don´t slouch.
Just as I thought.
Extremely stubborn and suspicious.
- I am not!
- See for yourself.
"Extremely stubborn
and sus--´´
Suspicious.
Now you,Jane.
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn´t put things away.´´
How ´bout you?
Very well. Hold this for me.
As I expected. "Mary Poppins.
Practically perfect
in every way.´´
Mary Poppins! Is that your name?
It´s lovely.
Thank you.
I´ve always liked it.
- Now, shall we get on with it?
- Get on with what?
In your advertisement, did you
not specifically request to play games?
- Oh, yes!
- Very well, then.
Our first game is called
"Well Begun Is Half Done.´´
I don´t like
the sound of that.
Otherwise entitled,
"Let´s Tidy Up the Nursery.´´
I told you
she was tricky.
- Shall we begin?
- It is a game, isn´t it, Mary Poppins?
Well, it depends on
your point of view.
You see, in every job
that must be done...
there is an element of fun.
You find the fun, and snap!
The job´s a game.
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake
A lark, a spree
It´s very clear to see

That will be quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.
It´s time for our outing
in the park.
I don´t want an outing. I want
to tidy up the nursery again.
Enough is as good as a feast.
Come along, please.
Let me look at you. Well, you´re not
as well turned out as I´d like.
Still, there´s time.
There´s time.

Wait! Don´t move.
Don´t move a muscle.
Stay right where you are.
I´d know that silhouette
anywhere! Mary Poppins!
It´s nice to see you again, Bert.
I expect you know Jane and Michael.
Well, I´ve seen ´em here and about.
Chasin´ a kite last time, weren´t it?
Mary Poppins is
taking us to the park.
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.
Other nannies take children
to the park.
When you´re with Mary Poppins,
suddenly you´re in places
you´ve never dreamed of.
And quick as you can say
"Bob´s your uncle´´...
the most unusual things
begin to happen.
I´m sure I haven´t the faintest
idea what you´re talking about.
Well mind, it´s not my place to say,
but what she´s probably got in mind...
is a jolly holiday
somewheres or other.
Something along these lines,
I shouldn´t be surprised.
"Punting on the Thames.´´ That´s
always good if you like an outing.
Here we go.
The circus. How about a lovely
circus? Lions and tigers.
World-famous artistes performing
death-defyin´ feats...
of dexterity and skill
before your very eyes.
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Oh, that´s lovely. If you please,
I´d much rather go there.
Beautiful, ain´t it?
A typical English countryside...
as done by a true
and lovin´ hand.
Though you can´t see it,
there´s a little country fair...
down that road and
uh, over the hill.
I don´t see any road.
What? No road?
Just wants a bit
of somethin´ here...
and a bit of somethin´ there.
There. A country road suitable
for travel and high adventure.
Please may we go,
Mary Poppins? Please?
Such a lovely place. Don´t you
think it´s lovely, Mary Poppins?
Now´s the time, Mary Poppins.
No one´s lookin´.
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself, thank you.
All right, I´ll do it myself.
- Do what?
- Bit of magic.
- A bit of magic?
- It´s easy.
Let´s see. You think.
You wink.
You do a double blink.
You close your eyes and jump.
Is something
´sposed to happen?
Bert, what utter nonsense!
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?
Give my your hand, please,
Michael. Don´t slouch.
One, two.
Mary Poppins,
you look beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart you do.
Like the day I met ya.
You look fine too, Bert.
I thought you said
there was a fair.
So I did. Down the road
behind the hill, remember?
Come on! I hear
the merry-go-round.
- Tell ´em Bert sent ya.

Ya-hoo!
Ya-hoo!
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!
- Ya-hoo!
- Our own private merry-go-round.
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed...
if you don´t wanna go nowhere.
Who says we´re not
going anywhere?
Oh, guard!
Righto, Mary Poppins.
Thank you.
They´re off! It´s Mary Poppins
leadin´ by two lengths.
Jane is second by a length.
Michael third.
My horse is the fastest.
Do you hear that, mate?
Do you wanna put up with that?
That´s the ticket! Come on, my lad.
Is that the best you can do?
Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!
Not so fast, please. Michael!
Now really, Bert.
You´re as bad as the children.
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!
- Whoa.
- Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.
Please control yourself.
We are not on a racecourse.
Follow me, please.
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. Wha--
I say!
Have you ever?
Never!
View Halloo!
Oh, yes, definitely.
A view Halloo.
View Halloo?
Faith and begorra!
´Tis them Redcoats again!
View Halloo!

Oh, musha, musha.
Poor lit´l bloke.
Let´s give him a hand.
Saints preserve us!
Yikes!
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!
Up you go. Now hang on.
Would you look at that now?
´Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.
Come on and fight,
you dirty omadhauns.
I can lick
the lot of ya´s.
Faster, me beauty! Faster!
Oh, riders, would you be
so kind as to let me pass?
Certainly, ma´am.
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma´am.
Excellent time, gentlemen.
- Oh, yes, quite.
- Perfect day for it, of course.
Oh. Oh, how nice.
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Hold still, now.
Watch for the dickie bird.
Uh, how does it feel,
Mary Poppins, winning the race?
- Oh, well I--
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Uh, Yes.
- Having your picture taken
for the newspaper.
Uh, oh, actually,
I´m delighted.
Besides having your extreme
good looks, if I may say so.
- Oh, well, I wouldn´t go--
- There probably aren´t words
to describe your emotions.
Now, now, now, now,
gentlemen, please.
On the contrary,
there´s a very good word.
- Am I right, Bert?
- Tell ´em what it is.
Right!

No, no, I won´t take
your nasty medicine!
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?
People who get their feet wet
must learn to take their medicine.
- I don´t want it. I´m not gonna--
- Oh!
Lime cordial! Delicious!
Strawberry! Mmm!
R-R-Rum punch.
Quite satisfactory.
Mary Poppins, you won´t
ever leave us, will you?
- Do you have a handkerchief
under your pillow?
- Mm-hmm.
Will you stay
if we promise to be good?
Och! That´s a piecrust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.
Whatever would
we do without you?
I shall stay
until the wind changes.
But, Mary Poppins,
how long will that be?
Silence, please.
It´s time to go to sleep.
Oh, we couldn´t possibly go to sleep! So
many lovely things have happened today.
- Did they?
- Yes! When we jumped into
Bert´s chalk picture.
And we rode the merry-go-round,
and all the horses jumped off, and--
And we all went riding
in the countryside!
- Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
- Really?
Mary Poppins, don´t you remember?
You won the horse race!
A respectable person like me in a horse
race? How dare you suggest such a thing.
But I saw you do it!
Now, not another word or I shall have
to summon the policeman. Is that clear?
It did happen! I saw it!
- Go to sleep.
- No, I don´t want to go to sleep.
Mary Poppins,
we´re much too excited!
Very well, suit yourselves.
Stay awake
Don´t rest your Head
Don´t lie down
Upon your bed
WHile tHe moon drifts

Stay awake
Don´t close your eyes
THougH tHe world

Glorious day, Mr Binnacle.
Glorious!
No one sleeps this morning.
Put in a double charge of powder.
A double charge?
Aye, aye, sir.
Shake things up a bit, what?
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma´am.
- Have you put the spoiled eggs
in my carryall?
- Yes, ma´am.
After our meeting at the Albert Hall,
we´re all going to Downing Street...
to throw things
at the Prime Minister.
Oh, how distinguished
you look this morning, George.
What´s all that fearful
caterwauling in the kitchen?
- It´s Cook singing.
- Cook singing? What´s wrong with her?
She´s happy as a cricket.
As a matter of fact...
since you hired Mary Poppins,
the most extraordinary thing...
- seems to have come over the household.
- Is that so?
Take Ellen for instance.
She hasn´t broken a dish all morning.
- Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
- And another thing.
She and Cook usually fight like
cats and dogs, but today--
- Let me hold the door
for you, Ellen dear.
- Thanks ever so, ducks.
Ellen, stop making
that offensive noise!
And shut the window!
That bird´s giving me a headache.
Yes, sir.
Quiet! You´re giving
the master an headache.
I´m so sorry you´re not feeling
well this morning, George.
Who said I´m not feeling well?
I´m fit as a fiddle.
I just don´t understand why everyone´s
so confoundedly cheerful!
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
- Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
- How lovely. Thank you, my darling.
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.
- Mary Poppins taught us
the most wonderful words.
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
What on earth are you
talking about? Supercali--
Super-- Or whatever
the infernal thing is.
It´s something to say
when you don´t know what to say.
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
Go on, hurry along, please.
Yes, Father.
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
Winifred, will you be good enough
to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?
I don´t think there´s anything
to explain. Do you?
It´s obvious that you´re
out of sorts this morning.
The children just came in
to make you feel better.
I should like to make one thing
quite clear, once and for all.
I am not out of sorts.
I am in a perfectly equable mood.
I do not require
being made to feel better!
But you´re always saying that you wanted
a cheerful and pleasant household.
Winifred, I should like to make
a slight differentiation...
between the word cheerful and
just plain giddy irresponsibility.
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!
I have no objection to anyone
being cheerful or pleasant.
But I do expect
a certain decorum.
I can tell you one thing, Winifred.
I don´t propose standing idly by...
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins,
undermine the discipline and--
There´s something odd,
I may say extremely odd...
about the behaviour of this household
since that woman arrived.
- And I want you to know
that I´ve noticed it!
- Yes, dear.
- One thing more.
- Yes, dear?
I suggest you have
this piano repaired.
When I sit down to an instrument,
I like to have it in tune.
But, George, you don´t play.
Madam, that is entirely
beside the point!
Now, let me see. First of all,
we must go to the piano tuners.
And then we go to Mrs Cory´s sh--
Mrs Cory´s shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!
And then we go to the fishmonger´s,
I think, for a nice dover sole...
and a pint of prawns.
Uh, Michael,
stop stravaging along behind.
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!
- Good day to you!
- Good morning, Admiral.
Michael, what fine adventure
are we off upon today?
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?
We´re going to buy some fish.
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.
Aye, aye, sir.
Let´s put our backs
into it, lad.
More spit and polish.
That´s what´s wanted around here.
It´s Andrew!
Uh, not so fast, please. I can´t
understand a word you´re saying.
Again? Och!
Oh, the poor man!
Bless you.
Well, yes, of course. There´s not
a moment to lose. I´ll go straightaway.
And thank you very much.
- What did he say?
- He said, "You´re welcome.´´
-What else did he say?
-I don´t think he said anything.
You know best, as usual.
- I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
- There´s been a change of plans.
Come along, please.
Don´t straggle.
Andrew, worrying
won´t help anyone.
Why don´t you go home
and put your feet up?
- Oh, Bert, I´m glad you´re here.
- I came over the moment I heard.
Well, how is he?
- I´ve never seen him as bad
as this, and that´s the truth.
- Oh!
How about them?
It´s contagious, you know.
- Shall we get spots?
- Oh, highly unlikely.
- Oh, Uncle Albert!
- Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.
It´s Mary Poppins!
I´m delight--
- I´m delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!
Oh, I kn-- I know, I--
But I tried.
Really, I did, my dear. I--
But I so enjoy laughing,
you know? And, well--
And when I start,
it´s all up with the--
That´s what happens to me.
I love to laugh!
Oh, my goodness!
I can´t help it. You can see that.
I just like laughing,
that´s all.
Jane, don´t you dare!
You´ll only make him worse.
- It´s really quite serious!
- Yes, whatever you do,
keep a straight face.
Last time, it took us
three days to get him down.
I love to laugH
Loud and long and clear
I love to laugH
It´s getting worse every year

Oh, welcome, children! Welcome!
Make yourselves comfortable.
That´s right.
Pull up a chair.
Oh, pull up--
I must say, you´re a sight,
the lot of you!
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.
He´s got a nice cushy job
in a watch factory.
In a watch factory?
What does he do?
He stands about all day
and makes faces!
He makes faces
in a watch fact--
You made that up. I know.
That´s so good!
Such behaviour!
Well, it´s the most
disgraceful sight I´ve ever seen,
or my name isn´t Mary Poppins.
Speaking of names, I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.
What´s the name
of his other leg?
Wasn´t that funny?
What´s the name of his other--
Now, then, children,
it´s time for tea.
I will not have
my schedule interrupted.
Oh, please stay. Look, I have
a splendid tea all ready for you.
And it´s getting cold!
Well, I had hoped that maybe,
that you would just, that--
Splendid! Thank you very much!
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread
and butter. Now, watch it, children.
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.
Next thing, I suppose,
you´ll be wanting me to pour out.
Oh, well. If I must, I must.
If you´ll just stop behaving
like a pack of laughing hyenas!
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.
-Uh, Bert?
-Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.
I´m so glad you came.
It wouldn´t be any fun without you.
Here, and you may pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.
Nice weather we´re having this
time of year, don´t you think?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, speaking of weather...
the other day
when it was so cold...
a friend of mine went to buy
some long underwear, you know.
The shopkeeper said to him,
""How long do you want it?´´
And my friend said,
""Well, from about September to March.´´
Jane! Control yourself!
Children, will you please
sit up properly at the table?
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Oh, thank you, my dear.
I´m having such a good time. I wish that
you could all stay up here all the time.
We´ll jolly well have to.
There´s no way to get down.
Oh, no, there is a way.
Frankly I,
I don´t like to mention it...
because you have to think
of something sad.
Then do get on with it, please!
Let me see.
I´ve got the very thing.
Yesterday when the lady
next door answered the bell,
there was a man there.
And the man said to the lady,
""I´m terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat.´´
- Oh, that´s sad.
- The poor cat.
And then the man said,
""I´d like to replace your cat.´´
And the lady said,
""That´s all right with me, but
how are you at catching mice?´´
Well, you know I started out sad.
I, I try, really I do.
But, but everything ends up
so hilarious, I can´t--
I can´t help--
That will be quite enough of that!
It´s time to go home.
- Oh, that is sad.
- Oh, no!
Oh, that´s sad. That´s
the saddest thing I ever heard.
Come along, children. Spit spot!
Must you really go?
You know, people come to see me
all the time, you know.
And, and we have such a lovely time,
and then they have to go home.
And, and I´m very, very sad
about the whole thing.
Don´t worry.
We´ll come back soon.
We had a lovely time.
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert,
will you, Bert?
- I´ll sit with him a while.
- Thank you. Come on.
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.
- Would you like to hear it?
- I´d be so grateful.
Righto. Well,
it´s about me granddad, see?
And one night,
he had a nightmare, he did.
- So scared that he chewed
his pillow to bits.
- Yes.
- To bits.
- Yes.
- Next morning I says...
- ""How do you feel, Granddad?´´
- Yes.
He says, ""Oh, not bad.
A little down in the mouth!´´
Yeah, I always say there´s
nothing like a good joke.
No. And that was nothing
like a good joke! That--
Bit late tonight,
aren´t you, Banks?
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?
Banks!
- Oh, Father, we´re so glad you´re home!
- Want to hear a joke?
We had the most wonderful
afternoon with Mary Poppins.
Speaking of afternoons,
the joke goes like this.
I know a man with a wooden leg
named Smith.
Smith? We don´t know anyone
called Smith.
And there was a second chap,
and the second chap says,
""What´s the name of his other leg?´´
And we had a lovely tea party
on the ceiling!
Oh, children,
please be quiet.
Mary Poppins says if we´re good,
she´ll take us there again.
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins
said that, did she?
Will you please return
to your room.
Mary Poppins, will you
be kind enough to come with me?
As you wish.
Mary Poppins, I very much regret
what I must say to you.
- Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?
- I´m afraid there is.
I, I´d love to stay, but I have
to dress for my rally in Hampstead.
Winifred, it is my wish
that you be present!
Oh, yes, George,
of course.
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am
extremely disappointed in you.
She´s for it now. I´ve heard
the master do this speech before.
I don´t deny that I am partially
responsible for allowing the children...
to spend their days on worthless
frivolity to the exclusion of all else!
But it is high time they learned
the seriousness of life!
But, George,
they´re only children.
Precisely. And in the light
of what has happened--
George, are you certain
you know what you´re doing?
I believe I do, Winifred.
A BritisH bank

In short, I am disturbed to hear
my children talking about...
popping in and out
of chalk pavement pictures...
consorting with racehorse
persons, fox hunting.
Yes, well I don´t mind
that quite so much.
At any rate,
it´s traditional.
But tea parties on the ceiling?
I ask you.
Having tea parties on the

outings of every other kind!
If tHey must go on outings
THese outings ougHt to be

Pressed and dressed

will be at your side
Splendid!
You hit the nail right on the--
At my side?
Where are we going?
To the bank, of course,
exactly as you proposed.
- I proposed?
- Of course.
Now, if you´ll excuse me. Tomorrow´s
an important day for the children.
I shall see they have a proper
night´s sleep. Good night.
Winifred, did I say that I was going
to take the children to the bank?
- It certainly sounded that way, dear.
- Oh.
And why not?
A capital idea!
Just the medicine they need
for all this slipshod, sugary...
female thinking they get
around here all day long.
Quite right. Good idea.
Quite right.
Good idea. Quite right.
Mary Poppins,
we won´t let you go!
Go? What on earth
are you talking about?
- Didn´t you get sacked?
- Sacked? Certainly not!
I am never sacked!
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hurrah, hurray, hurray,
- hurray, hurray, hurray--
- Neither am I a maypole.
Kindly stop spinning about me.
- But?
- Goats butt, birds fly...
and children who are going on an outing
with their father must get some sleep.
- Come along, please.
- An outing with Father?
- Yes.
- I don´t believe it.
- He´s never taken us
on an outing before.
- He´s never taken us anywhere.
- However did you manage it?
- Manage what?
You must´ve put the idea
in his head somehow.
What an impertinent thing to say!
Me putting ideas into
people´s heads? Really!
- Where´s he taking us?
- To the bank.
Oh, Michael, the city!
And we´ll see all the sights,
and Father can point them out to us.
Well, most things he can.
But sometimes a person we love
through no fault of his own...
- can´t see past the end of his nose.
- Past the end of his nose?
Yes. Sometimes a little thing
can be quite important.
Oh, look! The cathedral.
Father passes that every day.
He sees that.
Early eacH day
to tHe steps of St Paul´s
THe little old
bird woman comes
In Her own special way
To tHe people sHe calls
Come buy my bags
Full of crumbs
Come feed tHe little birds

And you´ll be glad
if you do
THeir young ones are Hungry
THeir nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence from you
Feed tHe birds
Tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence

Now remember that a bank is
a quiet and decorous place,
so we must be on our best behaviour.
- But I thought it was your bank.
- Yes, well, I´m one
of the younger officers...
so in a sense it is, sort of.
Michael, look!
- It´s her!
- Who?
- It´s who?
- The bird woman.Just where
Mary Poppins said she would be.
- You do see her, don´t you, Father?
- Well, of course I can see her.
Do you think I can´t see
past the end of my nose?
Listen, Father,
she´s saying it.
Feed the birds.
Tuppence a bag.
Well, of course she´s saying it.
What else would she be saying?
- Please may we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?
- I have tuppence from my money box.
-Just this once, please?
Waste your money on a lot of
ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.
- But Mary Poppins--
- I am not interested
in what Mary Poppins says.
Nor do I wish to keep hearing
her name for the remainder
of the day. Now come along!
But it´s my tuppence!
Michael, I will not permit you
to throw your money away!
When we get to the bank,
I shall show you what may be
done with your tuppence.
And I think you´ll find it
extremely interesting.
Hello, Banks.
What´s all this about?
- These are my children, Mr Dawes.
- Well, so I assumed.
- But why are they here?
- They wish to open an account, sir.
- Oh, indeed?
- Yes.
And just how much money
do you have, young man?
- Tuppence. But I want it
to feed the birds.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Tuppence?
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.
That´s the chairman of the bank,
the elder Mr Dawes.
A giant in the world of finance.
- A giant?
- Shh, shh, shh.
Uh, Father, these
are Banks´s children.
- They want to open an account.
- Oh, they do, do they, boy?
Excellent. Excellent.
We can al-always use...
al-always use more money to, to put
to work for the bank, can´t we, boy?
So, you have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?
No. I want it to feed the birds!
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds
and what have you got? Fat birds!
But if you invest your tuppence
Wisely in tHe bank

- Gimme back my money!
Jane! Michael!
Michael! Michael!
- Gimme back my money!

There´s something wrong. The bank
won´t give someone their money!
Well, I´m going to get mine! Come along,
young man! I want every penny!
- And mine too!
- And give me mine too!
Stop all payments.
Stop all payments.

- Give me my money!

Gimme my money back!
I want my money!
Come on.
Stop those children!
Stop those children!
Come with me, my dears.
Granny´ll hide you!
-Here, here, half a mo.
-Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!
Easy, now. Your old friend
ain´t gonna hurt ya.
Bert, it´s you!
In the flesh,
and at your service.
- You´re filthy!
- Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.
It so happens that today
I´m a chimney sweep.
Oh, Bert, we´re so frightened.
Now, now, don´t take on so.
Bert´ll take care of you
like I was your own father.
- Now, who´s after you?
- Father is.
- What?
- He brought us to see his bank.
I don´t know what we did,
but it must´ve been something dreadful.
He sent the police after us,
and the Army and everything.
Michael, don´t exaggerate.
Well, now, there must be
some mistake.
Your dad´s a fine gentleman
and he loves ya!
I don´t think so. You should´ve
seen the look on his face.
He doesn´t like us at all.
Well, now that
don´t seem likely, does it?
It´s true.
Let´s sit down.
You know, begging your pardon...
but the one my heart
goes out to is your father.
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank day after day...
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.
I don´t like to see
any living thing caged up.
Father in a cage?
They makes cages in all
sizes and shapes, you know.
Bank-shaped some of ´em,
carpets and all.
Father´s not in trouble. We are.
Oh, sure about that, are you?
Look at it this way. You´ve got
your mother to look after you.
And Mary Poppins,
and Constable Jones and me.
Who looks after your father?
Tell me that.
When something terrible happens,
what does he do?
Fends for himself, he does.
Who does he tell about it? No one!
Don´t blab his troubles at home.
He just pushes on at his job,
uncomplaining and alone and silent.
- He´s not very silent!
- Michael, be quiet.
Bert, do you think Father
really needs our help?
Well, not my place to say.
I only observe that a father can
always do with a bit of help.
Come on, I´ll take you home.

-Well, I´ll be gettin´ along now.
-Oh, please stay till Father comes home.
He´ll feel much better
if you shake hands with him.
- It´s the children, ma´am.
- Oh, I thought they were
with their father.
You haven´t been running off again, have
you? You know how terribly it upsets me.
Oh, they haven´t exactly
been running away, ma´am.
They have had bit of a fright, though.
Need someone to look after ´em.
Oh, of course!
Mary Poppins will.
Oh, no, it´s her day off!
- Ellen, I wonder if you would--
- No, ma´am. I haven´t done
me brasses yet.
- Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
- Not for a hundred quid, ma´am.
This here is baking day,

What about you, sir?
You´ve been so kind
in looking after the children.
Wh-- Uh, me, ma´am? W-Well, well,
I-I-I have to be moving along.
The Lord Mayor´s got
a stopped-up chimney.
Chimney. How clever of you to know.
Our drawing room chimney´s in the most
ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.
- W-W--
- Thank you so much!
- But--
- Besides, it´ll amuse the children.
The Lord Mayor´s gonna be
terrible put out.
Oh, thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies
in prison are waiting for me
to lead them in song!
Goodbye, my darlings.
See you soon.

A broom for tHe sHaft

Oh, it´s awfully dark

There now. You see

That there is what you might call
a doorway to a place of enchantment.

Coo, what a sight.
I do wish we could go up there.
So do I! I like chimneys.
Oh, rightly so!
A chimney is a wondrous thing.
She´s built tall
right up there on the roof.
When the wind is just right,
it blows across her top...
then draws the smoke
right up the flue.
Here. Feel the pull
on the end of that brush.
It´s like I got a whale on
the end of the line, ain´t it?
Michael, be careful. You never know
what may happen around a fireplace.
Oh, bother!
Michael! Michael,
come back down here.
Michael! Michael, where are you?
Well, that´s a bit awkward.
I must say!
Bert, I´ll thank you to stop
putting ideas in their heads!
- There goes the other one.
- Shall I go after ´em?
Well, we can´t have them gallivanting
up there like kangaroos, can we?
Michael, don´t be frightened.
Everything´s going--
Will you put your things on at once?
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!
- Here you are! I thought you´d left us.
- We didn´t mean to.
Well, no harm done.
The truth is...
this is what you might call
a fortuitous circumstance.
Look there.
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.
- Why not, Mary Poppins?
- Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
- Please!
Oh, well. If we must, we must.
Fall in.
Look lively, look lively.
Jump to it!Jump to it!
Get in line. Attention!
A-show arms!
A-right turn!
Quick march!
Hello there!
It´s just good, clean soot, Michael.
- As far as we go, right?
- Not at all.
What did I tell ya?
There´s the whole world at your feet.
And who gets to see it, but the birds,
the stars and the chimney sweeps?
Quite nice, but we should
all get in out of the night air.
Follow me, please.

Oh, Father, every one

You´re going to be the
luckiest person in the world!
- Come along, children. Spit spot.
-Just a moment, Mary Poppins.
What is the meaning of this outrage?
- I beg your pardon?
- Will you be good enough
to explain all this?
First of all, I would like
to make one thing quite clear.
Yes?
I never explain anything.
Yes. Banks here.
Mr Dawes! I´m most dreadfully
sorry, sir, about what happened
at the bank today.
I can assure you that--
Tonight, sir?
Yes, Banks. We´ll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.
- Without fail.
- Without fail.
Why, yes, Banks.
It´s extremely serious.
We regret this course of action.
We regret this course of action.
After all, you have been with us
a good many years.
- After all, you have been
with us a good many years.
- As was your father before you.
As was your father before you.
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at 9:00.
A man has dreams
of walking with giants.
To carve his niche

Before tHe mortar of His zeal
Has a cHance to congeal
The cup is dashed from his lips!
The flame is snuffed a-borning.
He´s brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.
Life is a rum go, guv´nor.
And that´s the truth.
You know what I think?
It´s that woman Mary Poppins.
From the moment she stepped into this
house, things began to happen to me!
- Mary Poppins?
- Yes, yes, of course.
My world was calm
Well-ordered
Exemplary.
THen came tHis person
WitH cHaos in Her wake
And now my life´s ambitions go
WitH one fell blow
It´s quite a bitter pill
To take.
It´s that Poppins woman!
She did it!
I know the very person you mean.
Mary Poppins.
She´s the one what sings...
A spoonful of sugar
THat is all it takes
It cHanges bread and water
Into tea and cakes
You see? That´s exactly what I mean!
Changing bread and water
into tea and cakes! Indeed!
No wonder everything´s
higgledy-piggledy here.
A spoonful of sugar
Goes a long, long way
Have yourself a HealtHy Helpin´
Every day
An healthy helpin´ of trouble,
if you ask me.
Do you know what she did?
I realize it now.
She tricked me into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.
That´s how all the trouble started.
- Tricked you into taking
the children on an outing?
- Yes.
Outrageous!
A man with all the important
things you have to do. Shameful!
You´re a man
of high position.
Esteemed by your peers.
And wHen your little

You Haven´t time

Well, goodbye, guv´nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Father?
We´re sorry about the tuppence.
We didn´t know it would
cause you so much trouble.
Here, Father,
you can have the tuppence.
Will that make everything all right?
Thank you.
Come in!
Take your hat off, Banks.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Well, get on with it. Go on.
Uh, yes, Father.
In 1 773, an official
of this bank...
unwisely loaned
a large sum of money...
to finance a shipment of tea
to the American colonies.
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.
Uh, uh, as the ship lay
in Boston Harbor...
uh, a party of the colonists
dressed as red Indians...
uh, boarded the vessel,
behaved very rudely, and,
and threw all the tea overboard.
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking...
even for Americans.
Precisely.
The loan was defaulted.
Panic ensued within these walls.
There was a run on the bank!
From that time to this, sir...
there has not been
a run on this bank...
until today!
A run, sir, caused by the
disgraceful conduct of your son.
- Do you deny it?
- I do not deny it, sir.
And I shall be only too glad
to assume responsibility for my son.
- What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!
- Uh, y-yes, Father.
- No, not that!
- Steady on.
Well, do you have
anything to say, Banks?
Well, sir,
they do say that...
when there´s nothing to say,
all you can say i--
Confound it, Banks! I said,
do you have anything to say?
-Just one word, sir.
- Yes?
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
What?
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
Mary Poppins was right.
It´s extraordinary.
It does make you feel better!
What are you talking about, man?
There´s no such word.
Oh, yes. It is a word.
A perfectly good word, actually.
Do you know what there´s
no such thing as?
It turns out, with due respect,
when all is said and done...
that there´s
no such thing as you!
- Impertinence, sir!
- Speaking of impertinence...
would you like to hear
a perfectly marvellous joke?
- A real snapper!
-Joke? Snapper?
Yes. There are these two wonderful
young people,Jane and Michael.
And they meet one day on the street,
and Jane says to Michael...
""I know a man with
a wooden leg named Smith.´´
And Michael says, ""Really?
What´s the name of his other leg?´´
The man´s gone mad.
Call the guard!
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
I´m feeling better all the time!
Banks, don´t you dare
strike my father!
There´s the tuppence.
The wonderful, fateful...
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
tuppence.
- Guard it well. Goodbye!
- Banks, where are you going?
I don´t know. I might pop
through a chalk pavement picture,
and go for an outing
in the country.
Or I might seize a horse off
a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!
Or I might just fly a kite!
Only Poppins would know!
- Poppins?
- My nanny. She´s the one who
sings that ridiculous song.
A spoonful of sugar
makes tHe medicine go down
THe medicine go down
THe medicine go down
THe medicine--
Mad as a March hare.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden leg named Smith.
A wooden le--
Father? Father!
Father, come down!
Daddy! Daddy, come back!
Wind´s come around,
blowing dead on from the west!
She doesn´t care
what happens to us.
She only promised to stay till the wind
changed. Isn´t that right, Mary Poppins?
Will you bring me
my hat stand, please?
Mary Poppins,
don´t you love us?
And what would happen to me,
may I ask...
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?
Yes, sir, that´s right.
George W. Banks.
About six foot one,
I´d say, sir.
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank
first thing this morning.
The only thing we discovered was,
he´d been discharged last night.
No telling what he might do
in a fit of despondency.
Wouldn´t hurt to have them
drag the river.
There´s a nice spot there by
Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.
Really, Ellen!
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman, sir.
No hanky-panky,
if you know what I mean.
- Oh, regular habits, sir.
Well, far as anyone knows.
- THe medicine go down
THe medicine go down
-Just a spoonful of sugar
- It´s him!
- Helps tHe medicine
- Or something that sounds like him.
- Go down
- Mrs Banks, could we have
a little less noise...
- on the premises? I can´t make
out what the inspector´s sayin´.
- In tHe most deligHtful way
Just a spoonful of sugar
- Makes tHe medicine go down
- George!
Oh, George, you didn´t jump
in the river.
How sensible of you.
It´s all right, sir.
He´s been found!
No, alive!
Or so I presume.
He´s a-kissin´ a-Mrs. Banks.
I´ve been so worried.
What happened at the bank?
I´ve been sacked, discharged,
flung into the street.
A spoonful of sugar
makes tHe medicine go down
Gone off his crumpet.
That´s what he´s done.
- THe medicine go down
- Dotty as you please.
George, what on earth
were you doing in the cellar?
You´ll see in a moment.
Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

will you?
Spit spot.

Oh, there you are, Banks.
I want to congratulate you.
Capital bit of humour.
Wooden leg named Smith.
Or Jones or whatever it was.
Father died laughing.
- Oh, I´m so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Never seen him happier
in his life.
He left an opening
for a new partner.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

That´s gratitude for you.
- Didn´t even say goodbye.
- No, they didn´t.
Look at them. You know, they think more
of their father than they do of you.
- That´s as it should be.
- Well, don´t you care?
Practically perfect people never permit
sentiment to muddle their thinking.
Is that so? Well, I´ll tell you
one thing, Mary Poppins,
you don´t fool me a bit.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really. I know exactly how
you feel about these children.
And if you think I´m gonna keep
my mouth shut any longer, I--
That will be quite enough
of that, thank you.
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don´t stay away too long.
OH, oH, oH
