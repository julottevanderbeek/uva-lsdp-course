Relax, Carter.
It's a promotion.
You know,
sometimes it sucks
having a dad who's
the town Smokey.
Well, sometimes it sucks
having a daughter
who's the town delinquent.
Dog!
I'm Jack Carter.
He's a U.S. Marshal.
I was an engineer.
Trains?
Space shuttles.
Allison Blake,
Department of Defense.
Where are you taking me?
Welcome to Eureka.
A haven where
the world's greatest thinkers
could live and work.
You must be the new sheriff
I heard so much about.
Nathan Stark.
You two have a history?
Not exactly.
He's my husband.
Section Five.
Let's go.
We happen to be in the most advanced scientific
facility in the world.
We ought to go back
to the last remnant
of whatever universe
existed before our own.
What's happening in there?
I don't know.
Systems are offline!
You feel that?
Yeah.
Henry, what did you do?
I couldn't let you go.
None of what we've known
for the past four years
was supposed to happen.
Henry went back
and changed history.
????
from saving Kim.
Someone's gotta go back.
I love our life.
I love this baby.
There's no time, no way,
that we don't end up together.
October 3, 2006.
What are you doing here?
I'm stopping you, Henry.
I have to save her.
Get the hell out of the way!
No! No!
I think this is definitely
becoming a thing.
We might.
We are at marginal
proximity now.
No change in core temperature
or ambient emissions.
Let's proceed.
Extreme proximity now.
Still no reaction
from the Artifact.
Moment of truth.
What's happening in there?
I don't know!
Systems are offline!
Get 'em back online!
I'm trying!
Oh, my God.
I thought I'd
find you here.
You're not returning
my phone calls.
I didn't feel much like...
talking.
keep reliving this, Henry.
It's been over a month.
I know.
I can't bring Kim back...
either.
But...not without
unraveling the universe, so...
Look.
You and I are gonna be
living with the memory
of a timeline that's gone.
I know it's gonna
seem impossible.
And, uh...I know it's
not gonna happen overnight.
But...I think
that you and I
should help each other
move on.
I mean, don't you?
Working on it.
The firebird,
of death and rebirth.
Mythical is right.
Phoenix is about
as real as Bigfoot.
History and cultures
are chock-a-block
with stories
Its sacrifice
to the flames
Lest we suffer the flames
ourselves.
So show
a little respect, lad.ct
Okay.
Another refill, Vincent.
That is my famous
five-alarm chili, Wayne.
You may wanna go easy.
Try a lobster button.
Uh...I been fighting
a cold.
Spicy food cleanses
the evil spirits.
The hotter the better.
All right.
Don't say
I didn't warn you.
So why don't you
just go talk to him?
I can't.
You know, everything is all
weird with us now.
Maybe it was just
a one-time thing.
You know, adrenaline,
heat of the moment.
Making out with Taggart?
More like a moment
of insanity.
Not so loud.
Look, I really need some
outside perspective here.
Please?
You want perspective?
Uh-huh.
You hooked up with a guy
whose age difference with you
is the same
as me and my dad.
That did it.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You need something, Fargo?
What? Uh, no.
I mean, I was, uh,
just gonna go get
some food.
I'm good.
Okay, then.
I didn't expect
to see you here.
Well, I didn't expect
to be here.
But my ears
finally stopped ringing.
I thought I could
use the distraction.
Well, it's good
that you came.
Yeah.
So how are
your burns healing?
Surprisingly well,
actually.
My last treatment's
tomorrow.
I take it there's no news
from the disciplinary committee?
It's the Department of Defense.
Nothing happens quickly.
Well, it was my call
to sample the Artifact.
Kim Anderson died
as a result.
As did the Artifact.
Someone has
to take the fall.
Nathan, it was an accident.
Let's just wait to see
what the results are
before we jump
to worst-case scenarios.
Gonna head
back to the lab.
Take one last look
at the Artifact,
just in case.
Look, I don't think
you should necessarily
forget about what happened.
I think it'd be wrong.
It'd be horrible.
But I do think that we should
look on the positive side.
Positive?
Yeah.
Like...
Like, um, the little things,
you know.
For the next four years
we're gonna know
which movies suck
before they even come out.
We're gonna know
where bad guys
are gonna do bad things
before they even happen.
We're gonna know, uh,
the outcome to every
major sporting event.
Huge financial upside.
Jack, I don't think
you understand.
That life is gone.
We are not likely to relive
many of the same events again.
Well, I've had
this picnic before.
Right? As a matter of fact,
tonight is the night
when I ask Allison out
for the first time.
I remember that, because
Vincent was right over there
making the same
lobster balls.
Buttons.
But...
Oh, whatever...it...
Oh, and, uh,
see the sweaty
Asian guy here?
on that kid's
hover thing
and spill his chili
all over that guy's T-shirt.
And I know that,
because tomorrow,
when I go
to the dry cleaners
to get my clothes
for the first date with Allison,
he's gonna be complaining
about how the stains
didn't come out
of his favorite T-shirt.
Yeah!
Jack, you have
to take a step back.
Granted, some things
may occur
in a similar way.
But they are going
to diverge more and more.
No--
You lived through
four years of a timeline
that was erased
because you stopped me
from doing the thing
that created it--saving Kim.
And the very fact that
we're having this conversation
means things
are going to change.
Everybody get ready!
The moment...has arrived.
There she is.
The firebird.
Well, so far,
everything's happened
exactly the way
it did last time.
Including the fact
that I still can't see
Taggart's crazy firebird.
Excuse me.
Okay, that's new.
So no one saw
what happened?
No, all our eyewitnesses
were staring at the sun.
There's not much
tissue left,
but I can run a DNA sample
and get an I.D.
No, I know who it is.
It's, uh, fat,
sweaty Asian guy.
What?
Carter!
I'm being descriptive.
If I knew his name,
I'd use it.
Wayne Kwan.
What?
Are you sure?
Yeah, he was on his third bowl
of five-alarm chili.
Fourth, if you count the one
he spilled on Dr. Brock.
You okay?
Yeah, that's Kevin's
occupational therapist.
He's been working with him
for years.
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell Kevin that he's gone.
Um, so, what--
he get too close
to a barbecue?
None nearby.
Uh, drop
a cigarette?
Mm-mm, Wayne was asthmatic.
He never touched them.
Vincent...do you have
any special ingredients
in that five-alarm chili?
Like what?
I don't know.
Alcohol, rocket fuel.
Whatever else you cook up
in that chemistry lab
you call a kitchen.
I'll have you know I come
by my spice naturally.
Without a doubt.
But that guy ate
three bowls of your chili
and burst into flames.
So if it's not
too much trouble,
I'd love a sample.
Cool.
Help yourself.
Any of you wanna
test it for me?
It's what I live for.
There is another
possibility.
What's that?
Oh, you're not
buying into Taggart's
crazy firebird
fairy tales?
You've got to admit,
the timing
was a little disturbing.
There are documented
incidents of combustion
when certain chemicals
are exposed to sunlight.
But in this case,
most of them
would have been
in his GI tract.
He also spilled a bowl,
so...
So maybe there is something
to this Phoenix thing.
Fine.
Go talk to Taggart.
But don't
get your hopes up.
Uh...
talk to Taggart?
By myself?
Why, do you have
a problem with that?
No, uh...
you just never let me
follow up on my own leads.
Jo, you've done this
dozens of times over the years.
What years?
Well, I...you know.
I mean, no time
like the present.
It's, uh...
I have every confidence
in you.
Uh...great.
See?
We're not in Kansas anymore.
How's Kevin doing?
I asked Beverly
to come over and help him
process the news.
Oh.
Kevin, has your mom
told you
what happened to Wayne?
He's gone.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm afraid he is.
How do you feel
about that?
Will I still see
the other man?
What other man?
The man downstairs.
Do you know
who he's talking about?
No, his sessions
were always one-on-one.
tell me the name
of the man?
Kevin?
I don't know.
Okay.
I, uh...
I don't wanna push him.
It's an awful lot for him
to process at one time.
He may even be
making up this other man
Well, thanks for
coming by, Beverly.
We really appreciate it.
by "we," I mean...
just...all of us.
You know, in Eureka.
It takes a village.
Okay. I might be making
a lot of house calls
in this village today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you, Beverly.
Hey, it's Carter.
I just talked to Taggart,
and he thinks
he may know
what happened with Wayne.
All right,
I'll be right there.
I call it
the Phoenix Effect.
When the firebird appears,
solar flares
emit high-energy
exotic meson particles.
Under the right
atmospheric conditions,
you can get
spontaneous combustion.
Is that human?
Of course it is.
Freshly-ground
skin grafts
from the bio-chem
burn unit.
Uni-directional
meson particle emitter.
Turn up the juice, and...
The Phoenix...rises.
I hate you.
You're welcome.
Well, mystery solved.
Except why did it only
happen to Wayne Kwan?
Interesting point.
I'm gonna go shower.
I'm covered in human.
Dad, it's been 20 minutes.
I need you to take me
to the concert.
I'll be out in a minute.
Allison Blake is calling,
Sheriff.
Oh, great,
put her through!
Oh, yeah, please,
take your time!
Hey, Allison,
can you hear me?
Um, uh, yeah.
I can do more
than hear you.
Oh, sorry, yeah.
Hey.
Hey?
Can you put that
away, please?
Oh!
S.A.R.A.H.,
no video phone in the bathroom!
Any idea what happened
to Wayne Kwan yet?
Henry's testing the chili,
and Taggart thinks the fire
was caused by an eclipse.
Uh, that's impossible.
He has impressive visuals,
though.
Um, anything more
on the man downstairs
that Kevin
was talking about?
Wayne wasn't working
with anyone else.
I don't know, maybe...
maybe Kevin did make it up.
Huh. Do you have access
to the GD phone records?
Yeah. Why?
Well, I figure if we can
find out who he was talking to,
it might tell us something.
All right, hold on
while I pull it up.
All right.
Take your time.
Okay, you know what?
Now you're just mocking me.
Uh...
Drive yourself.
Really?
Yeah,but...
if you're not home
by 11:00,
you will be sleeping
in a jail cell.
I'm not gonna make her
sleep in a jail cell.
She's only 15.
Right.
Which obviously means
that you don't have a license.
I won't tell
if you don't.
Well, I was testing you.
And I'm disappointed.
You failed.
Carter, there are a bunch
of calls to a chemist.
Rob Matthew.
But he works in Section Five.
Why would he be talking
to Kevin's therapist?
Nice place.
Yeah, Section Five guys
say they don't get
the best houses.
But they do.
Well, I live in
an underground bunker
that has more opinions
than my ex-wife.
Hey, I'm thrilled
just to have a window.
Do you smell smoke?
Dr. Matthew?
Is everything okay?
Oh, Carter.
Oh, no.
Dr. Matthew?
Guess that would explain
why he didn't answer his phone.
You know, if Taggart's right
about the Phoenix,
everyone
could be in danger.
Oh, it's not
the stupid Phoenix.
After everything we've seen,
how can you say for sure?
Well, because Taggart said
the combustion was caused
by meson particles
coming from a solar flare.
I'm no astrophysicist,
but I don't think
there are a lot of solar flares
inside a house.
He's right.
Really?
Could you not
act so surprised?
as getting a sunburn.
The sun's rays burn you
from the outside in.
This guy's burned
from the inside out.
Now, this is where
the initial combustion happened.
Radiating from here.
So their own minds
did this to them?
Yeah, it's like
a power surge
in the body's
electrical system.
Think of the brain
as the microprocessor
and the body
as the motherboard.
So...then food
would be the energy source.
Great--have you tested
Vince's chili yet?
Digesting the beans
in the chili
would release methane,
which is
extremely flammable.
Except then, the burning would
have started in the GI tract,
and not in the brain.
So we're back to
they just burst into flames
for no apparent reason.
We just...haven't
figured it out yet.
Maybe that's the thing
we should be looking for.
What's the thing?
Well, all this time
we've been assuming
that it was an accident.
What if someone had
a reason to want them nt?
That should do it,
Dr. Stark.
You can't even
see the scars.
Yeah...all better.
Time for your monthly
Botox injection?
Hello, Sheriff.
Really?ReNo comeback?
Just not in the mood.
All right.
There was another
fire last night.
This time,
we lost a researcher
named Rob Matthew.
What the hell's
going on?
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.
Two guys burn to death
within eight hours.
I'm guessing it's related.
Were they working
on anything together?
I doubt they even
knew each other.
Wayne was an occupational
therapist in Section One.
Dr. Matthew studied
biotechnology in Section Five.
Ah, well, we found a number
of interoffice phone calls between them.
They must be talking
about something.
Can't imagine
what it would be.
I'm gonna need
a list of names.
Anyone they
have contact with.
Friends, family, coworkers,
enemies, all of it.
You think someone
did this to them?
When something seems
too coincidental,
it usually is.
Dr. Stark is one
of the finest scientists
Eureka has ever known.
And I think
that his past contributions
should be considered
in your review.
Yet the fact remains
that Dr. Stark's decision
to sample the Artifact
cost millions of dollars
in damage,
and the life of another
of Eureka's finest scientists.
Eureka is a place
where we push the boundaries
of human understanding
every day.
And it is hypocritical
to punish Dr. Stark
for doing his job.
Are you speaking
as a D.O.D. liaison or his wife?
Ex-wife.
And I believe
that my track record shows
that our personal history
has never interfered
with my professional judgment.
Given the magnitude
of this incident,
I'm afraid the committee
has no choice
but to appoint a new head
of Global Dynamics,
effective immediately.
Why would anyone
want to kill them
in such a public way?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess that's where this thing
called investigating comes in.
Look, I need to know
who they work with
and what kind of research
they were doing.
What's wrong?
Trouble logging in.
System error.
Uh-huh.
Sure you have access?
There's nothing in this facility
I don't have access to.
Hey, Allie.
Cart--um, Allie?
Oh...
I'm trying something
a little less formal.
I'd prefer you didn't.
So would I.
I can't get in the database.
Any idea what's wrong?
The committee
has reached a decision.
And you're the messenger?
I'm sorry, Nathan.
Have they found
my replacement yet?
Actually, they have.
Anyone I know?
Me.
This isn't right.
I'll say.
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.
No, I didn't mean that.
I just--
I defended you, Nathan.
Looks like
you defended me
right into
a promotion for you.
The only reason
you're not being redacted
and escorted
to the city limits
is because of me.
So I should be
thanking you?
Guys, bigger issues--
Damn right
you should be.
You were obsessed
with the Artifact,
and it cost Kim's life.
I mean, what did you expect?
I don't know.
Not this.
Nathan, uh...
Fine.
What do we do?
Well, we cross-check anyone
Wayne Kwan or Rob Matthew
had in common, to see
if they were targeted.
You okay?
Yeah, let's just, um...
let's just find those names.
Sure.
I don't know if this helps,
but I believe things work out
the way they're supposed to.
You just have to have
a little faith.
Yeah, well...
I don't have
a lot of faith these days.
G-go back.
I know that guy.
That's the guy Wayne
spilled his chili on yesterday.
Ryan Brock, biotech,
Section Five.
He worked with Dr. Matthew.
What'd they work on?
The origins
of the Artifact.
That thing's
been nothing but trouble.
Tell me about it.
I've seen him
somewhere else too.
up to see me, please?
Really?
When?
Okay, thank you.
He left for the day.
With a fever.
Oh...
Good afternoon,
Dr. Stark.
Good afternoon.
Is there a problem?
For some reason your access
is coming up denied.
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's me.
Why don't you just
perform an override?
Regulations require special
authorization for that, sith
And who would you get
that special authorization from?
you.
Gotta love the irony.
Hey, Jo, it's Carter.
You copy?
Lupo. What's up?
Over.
Keep your eye out
for a Dr. Ryan Brock.
He's gonna be driving...
a black Subaru Forester.
Just like Wayne and Matthew.
We might have
We're gonna go
to his house right now.
Got it. Over.
Wait, the...
Wayne.
Scratch that.
We're gonna stop
at the dry cleaner.
Wait, wait--
how do you know that?
Well, I bumped into Brock
at the dry cleaner
the day we had
our first, uh...
First what?
Nothing.
I just know.
It's Brock.
Damn, what's he doing
over there?
Oh, God.
Dr. Brock!
Hey, uh, yeah.
Glad we could catch up with you.
You okay?
He's burning up.
Call the paramedics.
Actually,
I'm not feeling so hot.
Uh, maybe get
a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
Fire extinguisher?
What's happening to me here?
Uh, we don't know,
but it's the same thing
that happened to Wayne Kwan
and Rob Matthew.
Rob too?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Yeah, who would
wanna do this to you?
I don't know.
Take a seat.
Ow!
Everyone, clear this area--
now!
Allison!
Roll on the ground!
Oh, my God.
Carter, you tried
to save him.
I screwed up.
If I'd been...
a little sooner, I...
I'm having trouble
keeping the times straight.
Everything's changed.
What are you
talking about?
What's changed?
No, just...something
Henry was saying.
Henry.
What about him?
That's where
I've seen Brock before.
Oh, man.
Hey, Henry.
Whatcha workin' on?
???
What's up?
That's what I'm trying
to find out.
And I...sincerely
hope I'm wrong.
About what?
Could you run
the hologram?
Just--there's something
I need to see.
I thought you wanted me
to to leave it off.
Move on and all that.
I did, but I just realized
what our victims have in common.
So...turn it on.
Stop it there.
It's them.
It's Brock and Matthew.
Hey, look at that.
You're telling me
you didn't know?
Yeah.
What are you saying?
I'm saying
that everybody in this room
could be held responsible
for Kim's death.
I ruled out the accident.
I ruled out the eclipse.
I ruled out the chili,
or should I say,
you did.
You think
I'm capable of murder?
Well, you risked the universe
for her once.
What, is it really
that different?
Taking a risk
and taking a life
are two
very different things!
And I am incapable
of the latter.
Really?
Even for Kim?
Especially for Kim!
What are you working on
over there?
Not what you think.
Well, knowing the lengths
you went to last time
to bring her back,
what do you think I think?
Even if I did
blame those men,
what motivation
could I possibly have
to kill Kevin's therapist?
He wasn't even there!
You're right.
Unless he was.
We can see
everybody in the room.
Just...
can you fast forward
this for a second?
Please.
Yes, I do.
Okay, stop it there.
Can you jump forward
and show me
the other side of the room?
Okay.
This might be
a stupid question,
but what exactly killed her?
A concentrated burst
of particulate radiation.
A shotgun blast.
Shotgun.
What's on the other side
of this wall?
Another lab.
You'll have to look
at a building schematic--why?
I tracked this guy
down to a hotel.
Uh, I kick in
the front door.
He comes out
of the bathroom firing,
just barely missing me.
But the woman in the next room
wasn't so lucky.
Stray bullet.
Yeah.
We have to find out
if someone
was on the other side
of that wall.
Does this mean
you believe me now?
It doesn't matter
what I believe.
But the lab
behind the blast wall
???
Well, not that we know of.
Keep scrolling.
The radiation from the Artifact
is unlike anything
we've seen before.
sophisticated enough
to measure it.
Which means
that some of it could have
passed through the wall
undetected.
There, just, now--who--
who works in that lab?
Who was exchanging
frequent phone calls
with Kevin's therapist.
Can you tell if anyone
was in there
at the time
of the accident?
Yeah, uh, each lab
in Section Five
has a biometric
security scanner.
I can pull up
the entry log.
I can't believe it.
It's Wayne.
And look at the time code.
He should have been
in therapy with Kevin.
What was he doing in there?
He was visiting
the man downstairs.
My God, Kevin could have
been in there with him.
Wait, where is he now?
In session with Beverly,
Section One.
Jack, there was someone else
in the chamber.
Nathan is the last man
standing.
Well, he won't be for long.
I'll have security
help you find him.
Get him to cryogenics
while there's still time.
Everything looks fine.
But we'll keep him
under observation
just to be
on the safe side.
Thank you.
They found Dr. Stark.
Uh, can you
watch him, please?
We have to cool him down.
I was so close.
So close to understanding.
Nathan, stay with me.
????
Gah...
Nathan.
He's overloading,
like the others.
It looks like
a massive seizure.
It is.
From what?
Exposure to the Art--
Henry!
That's classified.
His temperature's
up to 104.
Okay, the seizure's frying
his electrical system.
We--can we shut it down?
You shut down his system,
he dies.
Well, not the whole thing.
Ju t bit of it
that's misfiring.
You know,
like tripping a breaker.
Maybe we can.
How?
Fight fire with misfire.
Jack is right.
We don't have to shut down
the circuit,
we just have
to disrupt it.
Great.
How do we do it?
Electroshock therapy.
No!
Small silver box.
Got it.
They used
electroshock therapy
very effectively
to disrupt seizure disorder.
Yes, in dealing
with epilepsy.
But we have no idea
how that will affect
what's going on
inside of his head!
And we don't have time
to fight about it!
Allison!
He's right.
Are you sure?
Please don't burst
into flames.
I'll do my best.
All right,
hang in there.
Oh, Sheriff.
Didn't know you cared.
Oh, I don't.
You ready?
Henry...
I know.
How are you feeling?
Oh, like someone
microwaved my brain.
But besides that...
Well, your fever topped 106--
we were all...
Me burst into flames?
I'm not giving the D.O.D.
the satisfaction.
I really am sorry, Nathan.
Don't be.
They made
the right choice.
You mean that?
Absolutely.
After everything
that's happened,
I don't think
I could do the job anymore.
You might be
just what this place needs.
This place
still needs you too.
I should probably let you
get some rest.
Nathan, can I
ask you something?
Sure.
What was Kevin's therapist
doing in a lab
in Section Five?
I wish I knew.
Hey, Henry.
Jack.
I hear, um...
Nathan's on the mend.
Oh, sure, rub it in.
Allie has thatook.
Had--had that book.
In the other timeline.
You okay?
Every time I try to make things
happen with Allie
the way they did before,
Tonight was supposed to be
our firs.
Stark was supposed
to take the job
she's holding his hand,
convincing him to stay.
And, uh...
sorry I suspected you.
You were just...
following your instincts.
Yeah.
Which were all wrong.
I mean...
I thought it would
be easier this time around.
I thought, uh,
it'd be fun, you know.
Like I could
do things better.
Yeah, um...
instead, uh, a man died.
And I accused you
of murder.
And the woman I love
is slipping away.
I-I don't know
if I can do this.
Maybe you don't have to.
What--what is that?
It's a modified version
of the memory neutralizer
The original was like
a shotgun,
erasing short-term memory.
This one erases
long-term memory,
but is much more precise.
It can pinpoint
the neuropathways
associated with specific
experiences and time periods.
You wanna erase your memory
from the other timeline?
I want to erase
our memories.
Whoa.
Jack.
And intellectually,
I know that you had
to prevent me from saving Kim,
but emotionally,
I blame you for her death.
I can't look at you
without thinking that
you're the one
who did this,
that you're the one
who took her away from me.
I wish there had been
another choice.
But the pain that I feel
every day that she'sot here,
the--the pain that you feel
knowing that you're not
gonna be with Allison,
that you're not gonna be
meeting the child
that you were
having together.
This takes all that away.
Can we keep some
of the memories?
'Cause there was this one time
with Allison--
Jack.
I'm afraid it has to be
all or nothing.
You're really gonna do this?
We have to.
And who will go first?
I'll make it easy for you.
I hear Nathan's on the mend.
Oh, sure.
Rub it in.
Mm.
You okay?
Yeah.
What...
Can I borrow this?
Sure.
I'll see you later.
And I will never forget.
Good morning, Allison.
Henry.
You look nice.
Going for a job interview?
Actually, I am.
I, uh,
I wanna work
at Global Dynamics.
Congressman Faraday.
According to Nathan Stark,
the Artifact appears
to be dead.
That isn't possible.
Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.
Kevin, honey,
dinner's ready.
