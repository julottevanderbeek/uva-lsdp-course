Hey, Dad,

No. That is me brother's room.
But, Dad, he's been missing

We need the room.
There's nine of us.
No. I'm keeping it
the way he likes it.
Though when he comes back,
I will have to break it to him
that some of his childhood
heroes didn't love women
as much as we thought
they did.
And one of them liked them
a little too much.
BOY: Dad, you're never

You might as well just give up.
Give up?
I know he's out there

And one day,
he's gonna join

Agent Graves,
Who's this in my ear?
And stop flirting.
We're on an open channel.
How much?
Complimentary, sir.
How now?
Hi.
Have you seen me brother?
He's called Sebastian.
Here's a photo of him.
It was taken a few years ago.
Are you in position yet,
Agent Graves?
Uh-oh.
Come on. It's stuck.
Come on.
MAN:
Please welcome Rhonda George.
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
When I started WorldCure,
people would constantly
say to me:
"You cannot rid the world
of disease."
I would look them
straight in the eye
and say, "Yes, I can."
Can you detect
any imminent threat, Graves?
RHONDA:
We are gonna figure this out.
And it all starts right here,
right now,
with one little boy.
His name is Schlomo Khalidi.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will cure the world.
Mummy was Jewish.
Daddy was Palestinian.
But they both loved each other
so very much.
I was born with HIV.
Now I am very sick with AIDS.
NOBBY:
Yes! Fantastic!
You are not
coming back from that!
WOMAN: Shh!
SCHLOMO: Though this
disease may kill me...
The operator.
...why can't we stop
killing each other
in the Middle East?
Where's the operator?
The camera's a gun.
Damn. The camera's a gun!
Who are you?
It's me.
Nobby.
Nobby?
And I remember days
We were running free
Long before
You broke my...
What the hell
just happened?
The head of the World Health
Organization's been shot.
Locate the shooter!
Locate the shooter!
There's the shooter!
Tiger Tail. Undercover.
My shot was compromised.
Take him out!
Sir, we have confirmation.
Graves took the shot.
Graves?
Ow!
NOBBY:
Cut it out. Leave him alone.
Behind you!
How can I help?
You can stay away from me.
You need me help.
Fucking twat.
Goodbye, Nobby.
Don't worry.
I won't leave you!
Aah!
Aah! My ankle!
Me bottle.
Get off me!
Come on.
The ankle's shattered.
You'll need to carry me.
Come on.
Get over me shoulder.
Sorry.
Get in.
Hey! Move away from the car.
Soon as I've printed
your ticket.
Come on.
You'll have to drive.
Move. Not that one!
What happened?
Never mind.
Just get going.
Come on, it's dangerous!
Get out of the car now!
Don't worry.
It's bulletproof.
You can't hurt us.
No.
We've got bulletproof glass.
Aah!
Roll it up!
Roll it up!
Just go. Now.
Oh, great. We can watch
the match while escaping.
Watch out!
Aah!

There's a penalty.

Isn't life strange?
I mean, yesterday
I'm having a normal day
down the pub with me mates
with a firework up me ass.
And here we are now,
with me brother,
doing some running
and swimming,
all different types
of cardio.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you a Vin Diesel
impersonator?
Or are you a hit man who
specializes in kids with AIDS?
What? I'm a secret agent,
I work for an offshoot of MI6.
How could you not tell
your own brother what you do?
Because within the title of my
occupation is the word "secret."
But if you can't trust family,
who can you trust?
Trust you? Trust you?
Because of you,
the head of the World
Health Organization is dead
and Harry Potter has AIDS.
You managed to do in
three seconds
what Voldemort failed to do
in eight movies.
Don't wet your knickers.
It's treatable.
Ooh, heroin.
That stuff's addictive.
It's a gateway drug.
To what?
To more heroin.
This is not heroin,
this is rapid bone calcifier.
It fills the fractures
in my ankle,
hardens the bone and muscle
around it so that I can walk.
Why, what happened
to your ankle?
You fell on it.
Hello.
SEBASTIAN:
If I help you, I'll be arrested.
If you don't, I could be dead
by the end of the day.
All right, listen.
Ledford activated someone
called Chil-something.
That's all I know.
Chilcott?
Oh, Jesus, he's a psychopath.
That's a kill order.
Oh, God.
Jodie, I need you
to do something for me.
I need you to find out
the identity of the man
who killed Javier Alvarez.
If I can find him,
it will clear my name.
I'll try.
Seb, can I press
this red button?
Aah! God's sake.
What?
You just implanted
a tracking device in my neck!
At least I won't lose you
for another 28 years.
I forgot to mention,
I got you a present.
What?
Two tickets for me and you
to go to Chile to see England
play in the final.
How do you know if England
are gonna be in the final?
Well, they'd better be
because I just got this done.
England, World "Championes,"
That says 200,016.
No, it says 2016.
That's 198,000 years
from now.
In that case, I got two zeroes
for free, so who's the idiot?
What are you doing?
I need to disappear.
There are people
looking for me.
You won't see me again.
Good luck, Nobby.
Yeah.
Okay. No, no, you're right.
I should... I should be
heading back home anyway.
Got to see the family.
It's good to reconnect.
Take care, eh?
Take care.
Wait. Since you're a spy,
does that mean no one knows
I'm your brother?
Exactly.
Well, then, I've got the perfect
place for you to hide.
Oh, no.
NOBBY:
Oh, it's so good
to have you back
in Grimsby.
You probably don't recognize it
since it were gentrified.
SEBASTIAN:
I am not from Grimsby.
Hiya.
ALL:
Hiya.
I've got a girlfriend.
It's nothing serious.
But she's fit as fuck,
so hands to yourself.
Go on. Shoes off.
Hey.
Missed you, Dad.
Missed you too.
Was I not clear when I said
I needed a secure location?
This place
is totally secure.
Although I don't know
who she is.
I'm just being hilarious.
That's our Britney.

You can have anything

Hi, Dad.

And this here is Luke.
We call him that

I'm so sorry.
He doesn't really.
We just shave his head

You know what?
You're looking at

Not easy to remember them all.
Aah!
His name is not Sebastian,

you need to know.
What the fuck are you on about,
Dad? It's Uncle Coddy.
Give us a hug.
JASON:
I can't believe it's you.
Welcome back to Grimsby.
They're your family. Those are
your nephews and nieces.
How do they know who I am?
I might've mentioned you
couple of times
over the years.
"Couple of times"?
I'll show him your wall, Dad.
There's you as a kid.
Leg it!
You little bastards.
Give me back me ball!
Fuck off.
Nobby. Pass us the ball.
Come on.
Pass it.
He's gonna score.
England's gonna win the final.
Nobby, shoot!
Oh...
Morning, officer.
Nobby and Sebastian Butcher.
We were trying to return
that beautiful ball
to its rightful owner.
It's not about the ball, lads.
Look, Seb. That's the couple
that's adopting us.
They're from London.
You're coming with me.
Right, Nobby?
Of course.
I'd never leave
my little brother.
It's all right to be sad.
But it's not all right
to stand there and whinge
like a low mopey bastard.
Who are we?
Come on, say it.
We're Butcher Boys
of Grimsby.
I didn't hear you.
Say it again.
We're the fucking
Butcher Boys of Grimsby.
They'll never split us up.
Forever!
Forever!
Anyway, your uncle don't want
to look at pictures
of me and him all day,

No.

No.
All right. Come on.
Let's take a look

But I missed you lot.
Missed you too.
Missed you too, Dad.
Answer it.
Yes, sir.
Hello?
SEBASTIAN: Ledford's watching you,
isn't he?
Hi, Daddy.
Aww.
You'll have to access the global
facial recognition grid.
And how am I going to do that?
Figure it out.
Hiya.
That the love of me life, Dawny?
Is that my darling Nobby?
I'm back.
I missed you so much.
Me too.
All right, kids.
Out. Now.
Out. Listen to your mum.
Out quick.
I got something very important
that I need to tell your dad.
What is it?
I lost me panties.
You sure your ass
hasn't eaten them again?
No, you daft twat.
I didn't put any on.
Ooh, I'm getting stiffer

Oh, look.
I'm exactly like

Don't worry.
That didn't come out

Oh.
That one did.
No problem.
Get over here.
I know you must
be gagging for it.
All right.
Come here, Nobby.
Hey.
What?
I'm hungry
for a Grimsby breakfast.
Well, the buffet's open.
I'll need a table for one.
It's all-you-can-eat.
See you in about
Get going.
Ahem, Nobby.
Oh.
That's me darts partner,
um... Ben Kingsley.
Nobby, what do you
take me for?
I know who that is.
That's your brother.
Where the fuck you been
all these years?
I've been busy. Congratulations,
by the way. When are you due?
Oh, I'm not pregnant.
I'm just fucking fat.
Nobby.
NOBBY: What?
It's imperative
no one know that I'm here.
You need somewhere isolated
where there's no one around?
Exactly.
All right.
I know just the place.
It's just this way,
past the train station.
MAN : All aboard the 915,

Go and have a pee now

Okay, bruv.

Nothing.

Just in here.
You sure this location

Relax.
Trust your brother.
ALL: Surprise!
No, no! Seb!
Come on, no.
No, they're our folk.
Welcome home.
Nobody's supposed

No one does know you're here.
These people know
I'm here.
Do you know he's here?
ALL: No!
We are here.
LEDFORD:
Let's just call it
professional intuition.
What's that smell?
That's me. Milky Pimms.
Oh.
I work our docks.
We transport cod
all over the world.
Fascinating.
Can I help you?
Chilcott. Move.
What is it?
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, God, I'm cornered.
I should never
have come here alone.
You're never alone
in Grimsby, bruv.
Lads. Lads.
See those blokes out there?
Those are Manchester United
supporters.
How dare those twats
show up here?
Delay them. I promise
I'll burn your school down.
No school!
Come on.
Oi, lads.
Get the ball!
Let's go, lads.
SEBASTIAN: They've got guns!
Excuse me, sir.
I think you dropped something.
Dropped what?
You're in Grimsby now,
you git!
Do you think I'll hesitate
to kill you? Little bastard.
Now!
Sanjiv, now!
Fish factory, this way.
Come on, fish factory.
Go there.
Quick. In there. Let's go.
Aah!
Seb.
What have you done?
You've killed him.
Nobby, what are you doing?
I'm showing some respect
for the dead.
There you go, mate.
Nobby!
What?
Get over here.
What is it?
I need you to suck
this wound in my shoulder.
No, no, no, I don't put my lips
on another man's shoulder.
That's very gay.
Do it now.
People have been
chucked out of Grimsby
for ordering
a vegetarian breakfast.
That pellet was filled with
caterpillar toxin.
I'll be dead in 90 seconds
if you don't suck it out.
Okay, okay.
Suck hard.
That's it.
Don't swallow the poison.
And now spit it out.
Well done.
Praise the Lord.
I thought I'd lost you,
brother.
I love you so much.
Nobby.
What?
I've been hit somewhere else.
Where?
I'm not falling for that one.
No way.
No, you don't...
What are you doing?
No, why are you
taking those off?
The toxin's coursing through
the left lobule of my teste.
Up the spermatic plexus
to my kidneys. Suck it.
Whoo!
As Jesus said,
"Thou shalt not suck off
your own fucking brother."
Do it, or I'll be dead
in 60 seconds.
I've been searching for you
for almost 30 year.
I could've found you
in two minutes on Grindr.
Choose. You can suck my scrotum
or you can let me die.
Okay.
What would you like written
on your gravestone?
Suck my balls!
Whoa!
I have less than 40 seconds.
All right.
This is for Dad.
Suck it. Suck harder.
Suck and spit.
Suck and spit.
Suck and spit.
It's traveling too fast.
I need to be on top.
Over here.
What? No. I draw the line
at teabagging.
Must shake this out.
It's not working.
Coddy.
Coddy, don't go. Coddy.
I've lost you once.
I refuse to lose you again.
Oh!
That's it.
We did it.
You did it.
We did...
You just came on me face.
It was a trickle
of pre-ejaculate at most.
Grow up.
RHONDA: I envision a day when people
won't have to live like this.
A day when poverty
will be eradicated.
MAN:
Sir, we've got something.
Suck harder.
Suck and spit.
So, what's this
new intelligence, Marber?
MARBER: We've identified the partner,
sir. He's Graves' brother.
Brother?
Kyle Alan Butcher,
a.k.a. Nobby Butcher.
A Maelstrom sleeper,
no doubt.
MARBER:
Just some working-class scum.
Find them and kill them.
Yes, sir.
JODIE:
He's Pavel Lukashenko.
He's on route to South Africa.
Good.
Yeah. And they know
about your brother.
No problem.
I'm about to ditch him.
Listen.
They'll kill him and his family
too if they catch him.
Do you really want
your brother to die?
Forget it.
Look, I need to talk
to your friend.
Uh, what...? Milky?
The fish travel agent?
What, so you can
gob-rape him too?
You monster.
No.
We're going
to South Africa.
Really?
I'm going on holiday
with me babby brother.

Jodie.
Hi, Daddy.
No, no, stop doing that now.
It's weird.
I've discovered
where Lukashenko is.
I tracked him to the Tshukaru
Bush Lodge in Kruger Park.
He's meeting up with
a biochemist called Joris Smit.
Maelstrom are clearly
buying something from him.
He's currently in a hotel room
with Lina Smit, his wife,
You need to find out from her.
You may need to seduce her.
Well, as you know,
I'll do anything for England.
I have done.
Your alias is Mr. Shelton.
Hey, English.
What?
I have something for you
to celebrate:
the best heroin in Africa.
Enjoy.
I'm embarrassed to say I've
never actually tried any before.
You'll like it.
Listen,
I'd love to stay in touch.
Are you on e-mail or...?
Linkedln.
It is
TabansiNyaguraHeroinDealer15.
Yes.
Who's that you were
talking to?
That is me new mate,
Tabansi.
He flies to and from
South America
with drugs rammed up
his bottom.
It's either that
or a life of crime.
SEBASTIAN:
Nobby.
I'll be gone
for a couple of hours.
Why? What are you up to?
I'm meeting someone to find out
why Lukashenko came here.
You stay here,
understood?
Oh, no.
I think I might've
mixed up our needles.
Oh, my God.
You can't do a secret mission
on heroin.
Not to worry,
all right?
Just leave the spying
to your brother.
Sebastian?
No, he's currently on couch,
smacked off his tits.
Who is this?
Can I help?
Nobby, I need you
to listen to me.
You are going to have
to take his place.
You need to head
to Maitland Station.
There, you'll meet a driver
from Tshukaru Bush Lodge.
When you meet him,
your alias is Mr. Shelton.
Did you get that?
I'll send the information
to your lens.
Or have I finally found
Something worth living for?
You could wait
For a lifetime
To spend your days
In the sunshine
You might as well
Do the white line
'Cause when it comes
On top
You've gotta
Make it happen
You've gotta
Make it happen
NOBBY:
Oh, no. Open the door!
Open the door!
Okay, you need to head inside,
find Lina Smit and seduce her.
What, and cheat on Dawny?
Never.
You need to seduce her
in order to find out
what Lukashenko
bought from her husband.
Okay.
She's easy to spot.
She's wearing a green dress,
and she's absolutely gorgeous.
Oh, no.
She is gorgeous.
Bingo.
I've got to go.
Remember, act sophisticated.
Hello, pussycat.
The name is...
Shelton.
M.R. Shelton.
I've been looking for you.
You want room clean?
Room clean?
Yeah. Yes. "Room clean."
From top to bottom.
I'm in 23.
But together,
we could make it 69.
Okay. I come soon.
Come on.
Ugh!
Good afternoon.
Hello. There's an emergency.
It's a code brown.
I've blocked the toiletry.
Could you send somebody up
as soon as you can, please?
Okay, Mr. Shelton.
I will send you
assistance.
Sebastian Graves is here.
JORIS:
Oh, good. Maintenance is here.
Mr. Shelton.
That is really
fast service.
I only just called down.
Thank you for coming
so quickly.
I hope I can reciprocate.
Yeah.
Anyway, uh, follow me.
Uh, ahem, come on.
In here. Let's do this.
Not your usual place to do it.
What? Why?
Where did you expect me
to do it?
In the bed.
In the... In the bed?
I'm not an animal.
I haven't done one in a bed
for over five weeks.
Let's be quick with this.
Shall I show it to you?
How do I know
that when I see it,
I won't fall
madly in love with you?
There's really
not much danger of that.
It's enormous.
All the better.
How hard is it?
Well, okay.
Let me try and remember.
Um...
I mean, the top of it is,
you know, very hard.
Actually,
painfully so.
Mmm.
Then kind of medium soft.
And at the base of it,
really hard again.
Now, should I tell you
what I'm gonna do with it?
No.
I'm gonna take it
in my hand.
All of it.
Right.
That's very unusual.
Yeah.
Right?
And then I'm gonna kiss it.
Gonna kiss it?
And I'm gonna put
all of it in my mouth.
This is worse
than
I bet it tastes like
strawberries.
And I bet you that it tastes
of kebab with extra curry sauce.
Listen. You're a total
fucking weirdo, right?
Just stay in here
and do not come out.
Okay.
So we meet again.
Please, come in.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Let someone else do that.
Please excuse me
for one moment.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm getting myself ready.
Shh! Listen, I get it.
You don't wanna get any
brown shrapnel on your clothes.
Brown... Brown shrapnel?
This.
You see? Hard, soft, hard.
May the best man win.
MAID: I go in there now.
NOBBY: No, no, no.
Let's get acquainted.
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a very
beautiful woman?
You are the most
beautiful thing
to ever walk the Lord's
green earth.
We're getting signal
from Graves' lens, sir.
Put it up.
So, what are we looking at?
Good God, Graves.
Whoo!
Why did Lukashenko
meet your husband?
Can you zoom in
on that stationery?
Send the coordinates
to Chilcott.
You'd rather make love
to a maid than me?
Maid?
Banu, out!
Sorry, Mrs. Smit.
Mrs. Smit?
Get out, Banu!
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Now, let me show you
how wild this animal can be.
Did you really think I'd let you
sleep with my wife, Mr. Graves?
No. But then again,
I never thought
that she'd chop up me poo
with a coat hanger.
Goodbye, Sebastian Graves.
SEBASTIAN:
That's not Sebastian Graves.
You okay?
Yeah.
How was the heroin?
Better than expected.
Why did Lukashenko
meet your husband?
What are Maelstrom planning?
I don't know.
Seb, don't.
Don't take it personal, love.
He kills everyone.
It's because he used
to wet the bed.
It's important she knows.
It's not important.
Well, it was important
to the boy on the bunk under you
who used to get
dripped on at night.
Get on with it.
Just tell us what you know,
and he'll let you live.
Come on.
Lukashenko bought
some kind of virus.
When is he gonna use it?
Tomorrow.
Where are they gonna
release the virus?
They'll...
Get down!
Stay down!
It's Chilcott. Move!
Come on!
Come on. Run.
There's nowhere to hide.
I got an idea.
Oh, great.
Because your ideas
have netted nothing
but gold up to this point.
You're gonna follow me
and do exactly
what your big brother says.
Hurry!
Come on.
Where'd they go?
They were just here.
Spread out.
Find them.
Oh, God, this is disgusting.
Sir, take a look at this!
NOBBY: Check if they've gone.
SEBASTIAN: I'm trying to.
What can you see?
They've gone?
The coast is clear.
Good. Let's get out of here.
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck me!
Brace yourself, Seb!
Get off him!
SEBASTIAN:
Get it off me. Aah!
The male can fuck
for up to three hours.
We have to make it come.
I saw it on the BBC.
You work the shaft,
and I'll cradle the balls.
It's gonna
break my neck.
I got them.
Come on, Sebbo.
You can do it.
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!
Put your tongue in the peehole.
Don't be stupid.
I think we're in business.
I think we're in business.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, God.
That is revolting!
Well done.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
It's a trickle
of pre-ejaculate at most.
Grow up.
See if the coast is clear.
NOBBY: Oh, no.
What? What is it?
It's an elephant
bukkake party.
SEBASTIAN:
Get it out.
It's breaking me asshole.
Not much longer now.
Brace yourself! Aah!
No!
SEBASTIAN:
All right.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I just did
an entirely white poo.
You need to get cleaned up.
Get in.
Is me ass okay?
Huh?
Yeah, it's good.
It's really good.
Are those your bollocks?
Someone's given you a hickey
on your right nut.
That was you.
Oh.
It's Jodie.
She could be your missus.
No, I could never be
with one woman.
Well, you're missing out
on the greatest gift in life:
Family.
The only gift I ever got
from my family was betrayal.
Why did you do it?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?
You abandoned me
when I was 6.
Now, why?
MR. GRAVES:
We have made our decision.
We've decided we can take one
of the brothers, Mr. Lowsley.
But Mr. and Mrs. Graves,
these boys are inseparable.
It would break their hearts,
and affect them both very badly.
This is the decision
we have come to.
LOWSLEY: But that would
leave one of the brothers
in the foster system
in Grimsby.
It's no place for a boy.
He'll have no future here.
CONDUCTOR:
All aboard!
SEBASTIAN
Nobby!
Have you seen
me brother Nobby?
Nobby!
No! Nobby!
Come back, Nobby!
Oh, my God.
So I could have had
your life?
That's right.
And you could have had mine.
Nobby...
I...
I am so sorry.
Wait.
I think our penises
just fist-bumped.
Disengage.
You need to focus, right?
Yeah.
You need to find out
where Maelstrom
are planning to blow up
tomorrow.
And I need to find a pub
to watch the final in.
Hold on. That's it.
They're gonna blow up the sun.
No, they're planning to bomb
the final in Chile.
What?
How are we supposed to get
halfway around the world
in 12 hours
with the entire global
intelligence community
trying to kill me?
We'll never make it.
I searched for you
for 28 years.
I do not believe in never.
That's the beauty of Linkedln.
Hey, Nobb-Man.
How is your brother
going to blend in
with those football
hooligans
looking like the guy
from
CROWD:
England!
England!
REPORTER 1:
have been arriving here
in Santiago
throughout the last
few days.
REPORTER 2:
to come and watch
your national team play
for what is ultimately
the greatest prize
This is a truly
international occasion.
REPORTER 1:
Star of stage and screen,
Daniel Radcliffe is here.
Middle East peace symbol
Schlomo Khalidi,
looking much better,
is here too.
And there will be plenty of
both at the end of the match,
because the final whistle
will trigger
what we are told will be
the biggest firework display
When we was kids,
did you ever think that we'd end
up going to the final together?
Yes, I did, brother.
MAN:
Nobby!
No.
Surprise!
Oh!
I missed you so much.
Hey. Our favorite spy!
CROWD :
Keep quiet.
MILKY PIMMS:
Nothing to see!
There's a commotion, sir.
Get in closer.
Graves.
Nobby.
Hey. I'll be back. Coddy!
Wait. Nobby!
Let's go.
Sebbo? Sebbo?
Sebbo!
Oi!
Seb!
Got you.
What is this place?
Oh, my God.
Maelstrom are sex
traffickers.
Listen to me.
You've gotta get out
before they sell you
to the highest bidder.
Get out. Get out now. Out.
Out. Shh! Quiet. You don't have
to live like this.
Get out. Out. Get out.
Regain your dignity. Out.
Seb.
"The rapist."
Hey.
Nobody buggers me brother.
A man can only take
so much jizz.
Get off him!
Aah!
Wait.
You're not Seb.
You must be freezing.
You.
Pleasure to meet you,
Sebastian.
I could understand why you
might want to kill
the head of
the World Health Organization.
Why bomb the final?
Bomb?
There is no bomb.
It's a disease.
It's a virus called RD-9.
Or as I like to call it,
WorldCure.
At the end of the game,
everyone in the stadium
will be infected.
It should take
two to three weeks
for symptoms
to start showing up.
SEBASTIAN:
By which time, 96,000 fans
from almost every country
in the world
will be back home,
spreading the disease.
Why are you doing this?
Well, think about it.
We have 7 billion people
running around
on a planet
that can only hold 5.
I'm just trying
to make the world
a better place,
that's all.
By deleting the surplus.
"Cure the world."
And whom, exactly,
do you intend to delete?
The garbage.
The imbeciles
who lie around drunk,
And sitting there
with their hand out,
expecting the rest of us
to pay.
And let's be frank,
who's gonna miss them anyway?
Kill him.
You're new to this.
You ever killed
a man before?
Are you gonna shoot me?
No.
How is it you English
football supporters say?
Oh, yes.
You're going to get
your bloody head kicked in.
Come and have a go if you
Think you're hard enough
Ow!
Maybe just shoot me.
Get up.
With a little
Bump and grind
With a little
Bump and grind
Time to say goodbye to your
hideous pig wife.
Let me give you some advice,
Ukrainian Ben Affleck.
Never, ever slag off
a Grimsby lass.
You don't have guts.
Whoa.
Well, that were easy.
Hiya.
Amazing.
Gotta get one of these
for the kids.
You have a family?
I just reconnected
with mine.
I'm going to go home and...
This killing business
is a right laugh, isn't it?
I understand why
you love guns so much.
I mean, it completely
detaches you
from the guilt
of your actions.
Ta-da!
Bonus point.
Will you stop
shooting everything?
ANNOUNCER:
Get that feed up. Come on.
I'm trying.
ANNOUNCER:
Four minutes
to decide the final.
NOBBY:
Mission accomplished.
All we need
is England to score.
This'll be the best day
of my life.
What? Every man, woman and child
in this stadium is about to die.
Put this in your ear.
Jodie, I need you
to check for anywhere
that might contain
the virus.
Okay, I will scan
for the chemical signature.
This is hopeless.
No, it's not.
Look who just sat down.
We need to stop her
before she sets off the virus.
All right, listen,
let's go around the stadium.
We can't go around.
There's not enough time.
NOBBY:
We need to go across the pitch.
Pitch invasion.
Too much security.
We'll never make it alone.
Alone?
We are not alone.
ANNOUNCER:
the more likely
to steal a late winner.
Hey, give me that.
Nobby! Sit down! Come on.
Men and women of Grimsby,
listen up.
This is important.
You see that lass over there?
What? Sharon Osbourne?
No. She's gonna release
this deadly virus,
and it's gonna kill
poor people like us,
because she thinks
that we are scum.
Bloody hell, Nobby,
we scum.
Well... Well, you are, Pete.
You're a registered
sex offender.
That's not a compliment.
So we're scum, are we?
Well, let me tell you
something about scum:
It's scum who built
the hospitals
that are now closing down.
ALL:
Yeah.
It's scum who die in the wars
started by the bastards
in charge.
ALL: Yeah!
It's scum that keep
the
franchise alive.
ALL:
Yeah!
So I ask you
to join with us now
and storm that pitch...
Yeah!
...and show the world that scum
cannot be washed away, ever.
ALL:
Yeah!
Yeah!
ALL:
We are the scum!
Yeah!
We started too early.
DAWN:
Whoo!
It's Graves.
Keep him away from me.
Okay, the target is on the move.
I'll sync with your lens.
Nobby, you ready
for a fight?
I thought you'd never ask.
Green Earth.
Target heading
southwest
through the German section.
SEBASTIAN:
Come on.
ANNOUNCER: Well, sanity has returned,
and so have the players.
The show will go on.
The final will be restarted.
SEBASTIAN:
Jodie, where's the virus?
JODIE:
Nobby, meet the head
of the biggest
crime syndicate in the world.
What, she runs FIFA?
Who's this idiot?
His name's Sebastian.
Boys!
Oh, bollocks.
Go!
Quick! She's getting away!
So we meet again.
I found it.
The virus is in
one of the fireworks.
Shoot her before
she gets to the detonator.
But what if I miss?
I trust you.
Oi!
ANNOUNCER 1:
That's all that's left.
Oh, look at Sterling!
Oh, no!
It's going over the bar!
ANNOUNCER 2:
ANNOUNCER 1: But wait!
What's happened to the ball?
No, the referee's
gonna disallow it.
Yes!
Come on, Nobby.
Stop shooting everything
and focus.
NOBBY:
Jodie, me gun's jammed.
Oh, no.
BOY:
Excuse me, miss.
Yes?
Go fuck yourself!
Aah!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes! We did it, Seb!
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah! Yeah!
Sanjiv, now!
Got it.
What? Please, no! No!
Goodbye, Sebastian.
No! No!
Cure the world!
No!
SEBASTIAN:
Too late!
There's no way to stop
the fireworks!
I'll jump on them.
It won't work.
The virus is in the tip
of the firework.
It would need to explode
within a contained environment
to stop it spreading.
There's nothing
you can do.
Yes, there is.
I'm from Grimsby.
Jodie, which firework is it in?
It's in the central
left-hand rocket.
What are you doing?
Contributing to society.
Aah!
Oh, Nobby. It's the firework
to your left, not my left.
For fuck's sake!
Tell my kids
that Daddy died with dignity.
Nobby, can you hear me?
The firework next to you
also has the virus.
What? No.
But I don't have
another asshole.
I need another asshole.
You've got one.
I'm from Grimsby too...
and I'm never gonna let you
leave me again.
Oh, my God, Graves.
Butcher Boys of Grimsby,
together...
Forever.

How are you guys doing?
How does me ass look?
Good. Uh, really good.
It's a bit smoky in here, Jodie.
Can we have the fan on, please?
Uh, of course.
So you were saved
from the virus

We're like a pair

Great.

Thank you.
Leave no witnesses.
