On the patio in the backyard.
Yeah.
Should we go look at
those window treatments?
No.
Do you want one of these hotdogs?
They're vey good.
Baby, you are a heck of a homemaker.
You know that?
But we could iust go to dinner.
Well, you know...
if you don't make it...
You don't eat it.
You know what? That's a great idea.
What if l make you dinner?
I'm gonna go and get that
grill. The big shiny one.
Will you get us some
shrimp? The big jumbo kind.
Come back and find me down here. In tools.
What the hell are you doing here?
You ignored my messages.
I am happy.
You're desperate.
I can make this work.
You're playing house.
Look, l'm retired. l'm
happy. We are happy.
Frank...
You haven't killed anybody in months.
That is not a bad thing.
That's a positive thing
for a lot of people.
Kemosabe, l need you.
They're coming. l can feel it.
You are driving me nuts, Marvin.
If it makes you feel
better, bring the girl.
I'm not gonna bring the girl anmhere.
Don't bring the girl where?
We're iust catching up.
Marvin's here. l iust bumped into Marvin.
Where are we going?
No, come on. They're gonna close.
Good to see you, Marvin.
Good to see you.
Frank.
You know you want to.
No.
Come on.
Last chance, Frank.
I'm taking Sarah home.
Stay safe.
Well, l really wanted to be...
Of course, it is, honey.
You are never gonna be
in danger ever again.
We don't even know what happened.
We don't know who's in there.
How am l gonna protect you?
Hey. He was your best friend.
Come on.
Wow.
He still looks so lifelike.
He's not dead.
Don't do that. Just let your feelings out.
No. Really.
He does this a lot.
Really?
No, come on. Give me the pin.
Come on, sweetie. Let's go sit down.
I should kiss him.
Go ahead. Do you want to?
Let's go sit down. Come on, sweetie.
At this time, we'll open
the floor to anyone...
who wishes to say a few
words about the deceased.
Babe...
Share a memoy, perhaps?
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.
Anyone?
You can do it.
Sir?
Marvin was...
different.
He was...
a vey good shot.
Some would say that...
he was paranoid.
But you have to expect a little of that...
when the CIA's dosing you with LSD...
for a little more than a decade.
He could wire a bomb...
faster than anybody l ever met.
The good people of Moldova will always...
be in Marvin's debt.
He was a really good friend.
Really good.
I'm gonna miss him.
Gonna miss him.
We have to move.
Canada?
High ground. Good kill
zones. It's a little farm.
A farm? Like, to farm on?
Like, with crops?
Yeah. It could be fun.
Listen, babe...
You know they say it's really
important not to make big...
life altering decisions
right after a loss.
If they can get to Marvin, they can
get to you and they can get to me.
Who are they?
Go to the safe house.
Look at me.
Go to the safe house.
I'll come find you.
I'm not leaving you.
It'll be alright.
What is it?
Mr. Moses...
They want to debrief you
at a Yankee White facility.
Is that your sniper?
You're flagged Retired
E_remely Dangerous.
YANKEE WHITE FACILITY
Hi there.
My client Frank Moses is here.
He's an American citizen being
detained illegally without due process.
That is a lovely blazer.
Thank you.
That is a lovely blazer.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Sory, l have no idea. But
let me get Mr. Snyder for you.
Thank you.
How can l help you?
Hi there. What is your name?
John Snyder.
John. l didn't get your name.
It's Kelly.
Hi, Kelly.
John...
John...
Unless you want to end up like Kelly...
l suggest you tell me where
Frank Moses is right now.
Now!
In interrogation.
I got a document right
here that says that...
you have a special
interest in the Cold War.
We know that back in the day,
you spent a lotta time in Russia.
I just need to know what you
know about Project Nightshade.
I really don't know anything about it.
What the hell is that?
Small arms gunfire, 200 yards.
Watch him.
They're coming to kill us.
Get me outta these cuffs.
I can't do that, sir.
You have the key, right?
Hands up!
They're gonna kill us both, if
you don't get me outta these cuffs.
Come on.
Frank Moses.
Coming up through the
ranks, you were my hero.
Given enough time, l
guess eveyone cracks.
Frank.
Who are you?
Me?
I'm the guy the government
hires to get information.
And l'm allowed to use any
form of torture l deem fit.
And l will torture Sarah until you speak.
Speaking of Sarah...
l love watching her...
shave her legs in the tub.
Kinda reminds me of these
Belgian mercs l met in the Congo.
They would skin people
alive to get them to talk.
And do you know where they started?
Guess.
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.
So...
you either give me the
information that l need to know...
Or l'm gonna filet your girl
from head to toe with no mercy.
Awesome.
Wow.
Pretty good for a retired guy. But are you
Son of a
Go. Go go go!
Shoot him, but don't kill him.
Alright, kill him. Spray it up.
Frank, this is your last chance.
Fire.
Get in there! Go!
Shit.
Marvin!
You're driving me crazy!
I brought the key.
You faked your death.
Gotta go.
Let's go.
Gotta go.
You have no idea what you put me through!
Thank God, you're okay.
No!
What are you doing here?
Marvin brought me. From the house.
Has eveybody lost their mind?
You don't bring a girl like that here.
I had to see if you were okay.
Honey!
I thought...
What?
Remember when we discussed
how you were gonna lay low?
You don't get to tell me when to lay.
I'm not saying that.
Stop. Just don't.
You're mad at me now?
You treat me like a China doll.
Frank, can l give you a
little advice about women?
Absolutely not!
Ask yourself, what is a girl like
that doing with a guy like you?
It ain't for your looks.
I will shoot you. l will
shoot you in the liver.
A, R, D, A.
Adventure, romance, danger...
activities you can share as a couple.
It's about you lying to me.
Frank...
l was vey touched that
you cried at my funeral.
That's not true.
I didn't cy at your funeral.
I'm no crier.
a document on the internet...
that said you and l took part in
an operation called Nightshade...
back in '79.
That's why you fake died?
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.
So eveybody's after you...
for something they think you know
that you don't even know at all?
Oh my God! Spiders!
Honey, you need to go to ground
and it's best l don't know where.
Yeah, l'm not going anmhere.
Cash only. No calls.
No contacts.
Thanks. Look...
l'm not hanging out in some bunker...
while you slink around
and save the planet...
with dusky international femme fatales.
Dusky?
Dark, smoldering.
I know what it means. Marvin.
It's hard to be the kinda
person l have to be right now...
and do the kinda things that
l'm going to have to do...
while you're here.
This is gonna be good for us.
What are we doing?
Face it, Columbo, things
were getting a little stale.
Wow. Mommy just slapped
Daddy at the dinner table.
Is there a human being in the trunk?
Yeah.
Who is it? Marvin
He's a Senior Director
of Militay Intelligence.
I've been caramelizing his
onions for a couple of days.
Caramelizing how?
With three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.
Dang!
THE PENTAGON
And the SecDef wants a briefing?
You were brought in to contain this.
Calm down.
I can't believe this is coming
back on me after so many years.
General, Moses and Boggs
have been completely isolated.
The FBl is seeking them for the murders.
Homeland has been informed that they
are officially domestic terrorists.
Is that gonna work?
Yes.
The problem is with that document
su_acing on the internet...
all the players will be
coming after Nightshade.
It'll open the book on this.
I'm calling SecDef. We need to go public.
General...
Nobody's going public.
We need a new plan for Moses.
I need you to approve a specialist.
What? CIA?
It's been tried, sir. Didn't
work so well for those guys.
Han Cho Bai. He's the best.
Do it.
HONG KONG
Suit, too.
He's clean.
Seriously?
Sit down, Mr. Han.
Your security is impressive.
A business associate.
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.
Vey difficult to get close to.
Of course, it must
appear like an accident.
Not a problem. Except for one thing.
Mr. Fernandes pays better.
Yeah?
Who's the target?
It's an old pal of yours. Frank Moses.
Karma's a bitch, Frank.
HEADQUARTERS Ml6 LONDON
What is this?
There's a watchword flag
on a WikiLeaks document.
It's coded Priority One Alpha Seven.
Something called Nightshade.
Shut up!
Get out.
Find me Victoria Winslow.
Director Philips?
I'm with someone right now.
Keeping busy, l see.
Idle hands do the Devil's work.
Yes.
I understand you can
get close to Frank Moses.
Yes.
Ml6 has a iob for you.
If you want to stay alive,
you're going to accept it.
It's time to choose sides, Victoria.
Where do they teach you guys this stuff?
Manuals, mostly.
Some of this stuff you iust can't teach.
Wow.
Isn't this cool?
We're on a mission together.
Do you have any idea how many
people are tying to kill us?
We both know this is where you belong.
Right here. In the thick of it.
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.
Here we go.
Watch your step.
Come on!
Where did you get this?
Marvin.
You gave her a gun?
It is America.
Eveyone else has a gun.
She has no idea what to do with this.
I know exactly what to do with it.
You don't give fire to a kitten.
Why don't you iust give her some dynamite?
No e_ernal safety on the Sig?
Tell him what you told me.
At the height of the Cold War...
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general...
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.
That's it. Can l go?
You want a little pepper with that?
At the height of the Cold War...
a megaton yield device
was smuggled into Moscow...
in diplomatic pouches, piece by piece...
and then the weapon was lost. That's it.
You lost a nuke in Moscow?
The scientist was
Edward Bailey. That's it.
What?
I made a mistake.
Edward Bailey was a genius physicist...
who built some of the greatest
stuff during the Cold War.
Neutron bombs, particle
beam weapons, nerve gas.
Excellent nerve gas.
He was a rock star of
conceptual mass killing.
They called him "The Da Vinci of Death".
We were the security detail...
assigned to getting him in
and out of Moscow safely.
What happened?
We thought he was secure.
The Soviets got him with a car bomb.
It was my fault.
He's dead.
Run or fight?
All we've got is this
WikiLeaks page off the internet.
Out of a Paris IP.
Paris could be anybody.
Wait. Scroll back down for a second.
What is that?
Coffee stain?
Wine.
Frog.
What?
We're okay.
Your number.
Yeah.
Ml6 has just given me
a contract to kill you.
Apparently, you're guilty of
nuclear terrorism, murder...
and you're number one on
Interpol's Most Wanted.
What did you say?
I said "Yes."
The money's good. And if l
don't do it, somebody else will.
You should know the Americans
are sending someone also.
Who?
Han.
It's bad, isn't it?
Is that Marvin?
Yes. And Sarah.
Send them my love.
They're driving me crazy.
Marvin gave her a gun.
Was it loaded?
Yes!
Are you being controlling?
No!
You have to take chances
in a relationship.
You have to be supportive.
I don't need her to fit in.
I just need her to be safe.
Just rent "Dirty Dancing",
tell her you love her.
It's important to enjoy
life while you still can.
Victoria just accepted a contract
from Ml6 to kill all 3 of us.
You don't think she'd do that, do you?
She's a friend.
Are you stupid? You never took
a contract out to kill a friend?
She called to give us fair warning.
Come on. There's one more thing.
Han iust went number one.
Why don't they just
dip our balls in honey...
and stake us to an ant farm?
Come on.
Whoa!
Crazy old bastard.
Frank, do you feel old?
Not really.
Me neither.
Crazy sometimes, l guess.
Who's Han?
Who's Han?
Korean. Counter intel.
Frank put him in iail for a few years.
We should be super scared of him?
Yes. He is the best
contract killer in the world.
I've got a hit off an old alias,
silent for almost 20 years.
He's dodging watch lists.
Bingo. Private flight to Paris
scheduled for 0900 out of Teterboro.
Find their hotel. Get blueprints and
workups on the day and night managers.
Have Vance meet us on the ground.
TETERBORO, NEW JERSEY
They're 1 floor down. 2 adioining rooms.
Surveillance is almost up and running.
This is going to be easier than l thought.
Hello. Speaking.
Yes.
Where are they?
They were here. They ordered
room service at 1 o'clock.
What do you mean "The plane is prepped"?
I think someone stole your plane.
I'm really going to enioy killing him.
Get me a gun that really hurts.
How good is this guy?
Han is the best contract
killer in the world. How good is this guy?
Han is the best contract
killer in the world.
Frank is in some vey deep dog doo.
He's not gonna kill me.
Yeah. Nobody kills Frank Moses.
Right!
The people he really doesn't like,
he tortures for a long time first.
Can we just focus on
tying to catch The Frog?
What's the action plan for
target acquisition and rendition?
Marvin?
Quit teaching her stuff!
Nice.
What do you think the most ex pensive
bottle of wine in the world costs?
Chateau d'Yquem 1847.
Maybe 5, 6 bottles left in
the world. It's pretty pricey.
Maybe we should get a bottle and
ty to catch The Frog with it.
PARIS
My God, this is so romantic!
Come here. Keep your head down.
But we have to go to the
le Saint Louis for gelato.
I don't think so.
Really? What about the...
Frank, is that?
Hello, Frank.
Have you seen her since?
Nope.
God, l've missed you.
Who is she?
Trouble.
How are things?
Yeah, Frank, how are things?
Sarah...
This is Katia.
Yeah. Hi.
I need to speak with you. Immediately.
What the hell was that?
Katja Petrokovich. Russian
Counter Intelligence.
I think we should hear
what she has to say.
Frank...
You don't know the half of it.
She and Frank were young.
He didn't have the slightest idea
she was working for the Russians.
She's Frank Moses' kyptonite.
I like you with no hair.
Bald men are so sey. Virile.
Wow.
She's cute. Where did
you find her? Nebraska?
Kansas.
Kansas.
So what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?
I would like to believe
that the US didn't plant...
a weapon of mass destruction
in Moscow. But l don't.
Why are you in Paris?
We come evey fall for Strike
Season and for the weather.
The US seems to think
you're nuclear terrorists.
Russia wants complete access.
You agree now or l'll hand
you over to the US government.
Can't we iust kill her?
Excuse me for one second.
Can l talk to you?
What? Uh huh. Sure thing.
I was shocked.
I know. She was kinda counting
your teeth with her tongue.
A little, yeah.
Can she go now?
We don't really have a
choice. We need her to help us.
I promise there is nothing between us.
No, sir. This guy's
not giving us anything.
Website's been scrubbed.
NSA intercepted a dispatch
to the Kremlin from Paris.
Moses is going after
someone called "The Frog".
The Frog.
So they call him "The
Frog" because he's French?
No. He poisoned the water
supply at KGB headquarters...
with the Amazon tree frog poison.
He must have been wiping those
little tree humpers for years.
Incapacitated 1600 people and
left with evey secret we had.
The guy makes a fortune
selling information.
He knows so much even
the US won't touch him.
The hard part is gonna
be taking him alive.
Superb.
Wine is wine.
I want to buy American
air defense protocols.
Why is it terrorists
never appreciate Burgundy?
I don't think you know
who you're dealing with.
PLACE BID
SOLD
Confirmed. It's him. It's the Frog.
Just don't look at him, right?
Just act natural.
And don't look him right in the eyes.
Check.
Remember, don't look right at him.
Marvin, you alright?
Yeah.
Get her outta here.
When?
Now!
Get a car!
Is that?
Cut them off!
This is not a good idea!
She's not gonna get there first!
Sidewalk!
Watch the curb!
Yes!
Happy trails, bozo!
Don't you think we should let...
Shut your pie hole, Marvin!
Don't you think we should let...
Hush!
Incoming!
Bastard! Sidewalk!
What the?
She's fine.
Got him.
What are you doing?
Got him.
Look! What is she doing?
I'm begging
Yeah, yeah. l got this.
I so got this.
I hate her so much.
You're wasting your time!
You're going to regret this more
than you can possibly imagine.
You know who we are?
Yes, of course.
Tell us about Nightshade.
You think l'm going to roll
over for you hegemonic...
Mickey Mouse loving Americans?
Leave Mickey out of it.
Yes. That one's rather...
God's sake!
Wait wait wait! That bottle!
How do we find it?
Never!
Nightshade was the plot of lunatics.
I used to be like you.
Driven by ideology and fear...
with no love of what's
beautiful in the world.
I can't trust animals like you!
Do what you will.
Death is easy.
It's not about the
destination.lt's about the journey.
Death is an art form in Russia.
There are so many ways
to take a man to bits.
Shall we start with a Chechen
facelift? Hold him down!
Stop! Stop it!
This is how we do it.
Please. You're so brave.
But you have to understand...
we're doing this for the
right reasons. And this...
This isn't worth your life.
You must have something to live for.
Art.
Wine.
Women?
Hey.
Help us.
We need this information.
You'll be helping us
save the world. Please.
You, l'll help.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
And you can suck it.
Baby? Honey?
Seriously? You hooked up with that?
What a woman.
Is that the same dress?
They look the same to you?
No one ever called me
Frank Moses' kyptonite.
Frank's crazy about you.
I've never seen him afraid
of anything except losing you.
What if l'm ruining his life?
Frank is a vey simple
creature with vey simple needs.
It's killing...
eating...
se_ing...
eating...
Killing, l guess.
What's your point?
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.
Well, l've kissed a lotta frogs.
I got something for ya.
What is it?
The key to The Frog's
security deposit box.
From?
Credit Lyonnais.
Baby, l have a request.
How would you feel about going
out to dinner with me tonight?
It is Paris, after all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Stay here. l'll be right back.
I need you, Frank.
It's not a good time.
One of our old assets
has some real information.
He needs to meet with us right now.
Nah.
Frank, what are you
doing? She's kyptonite.
I'll handle it.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
It's not okay. It's just
some work. No, it's not fun.
Go. You and Svetlana work it out.
I promise you that l will
be back in time for dinner.
I'll be back.
Keep her safe.
What happened to us, Frank?
Well...
You betrayed me. You set
me up. Tried to kill me.
I tried to kill you.
They were good times, weren't they?
If you'd asked me to betray my
county, you know l would have.
Yes, madam.
My God.
You know, l looked you up once.
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.
There were roses out in front.
But l lost my nerve.
So what do you want?
It was all about work with you. Rules.
Not rules.
Right and wrong.
It's harder for me not to follow orders.
Despite my personal feelings.
But feelings don't matter
any more than right or wrong.
Orders matter.
Orders?
Russia will handle things from here.
I'm taking the key.
I can't let that happen.
No?
I can't feel my arms.
Enioy Kansas.
He's out.
He might be awake.
Good. So he can feel it.
Did you ever, ever in your entire career...
let yourself get drugged?
I iust don't like her!
And now she has the key!
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.
What?
I knew she would play him like
a banjo at an Ozark hoedown.
So l have the key.
Water.
How long was l out for?
Some of it's his.
Et tu, Marvin?
Style is the only constant in life.
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.
Shopping's what l
thought you did in Paris...
with your bo_riend's money...
while you're waiting for him...
to wake up from being taken down...
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian bi atch ex girlfriend.
So thanks.
Thanks for the compliment for the fur.
For telling me that l
look nice in my dress.
It makes me feel really good.
And it makes me feel vey
loving towards you also.
Why is she doing this to me?
We can get a taxi over here.
Listen, l gotta tell you something.
You have to share your feelings
to evolve your relationship.
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.
If you stay where you are,
you're gonna die. Okay?
So what do you do?
Make the run.
Yes. You have got to make the run...
Make the run.
Yes. You have got to make the run...
to emotional safety.
You dead yet, Moses?
Not yet.
You dead yet, Moses?
Not yet.
Where's my plane?!
In my ass!
It's in an airport outside of Paris.
What are you? Shut up!
Let's get outta here.
Marvin?
Yeah?
Is that a stick of
dynamite in your pocket?
Yeah, but l'm saving it for an emergency.
This is kind of an emergency, isn't it?
CREDIT LYONNAIS BANK
PARIS
The key l gave her is connected to...
a particularly nasty terrorist
cell and their safe deposit box.
The French take this kinda
thing pretty seriously.
That's enough.
Put me down now! Now!
Alright.
We gotta move quickly, Moscow
will have her out within the hour.
For the love of Mike.
Alright.
I'm still not talking to you.
This is an Ml6 report
on Project Nightshade.
It's about the operative
that placed the device.
They took him into
custody and put him on ICE.
What's ICE?
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute.
Who would they keep on ICE for 32 years?
Come on. Gotta go.
ENGLAND
How could she have possibly found us?
Cause l called her and
told her we were coming.
I couldn't take the
pressure of not knowing.
Why isn't she shooting at us?
That should buy us 24 hours.
Hello, sweetie.
The ne_ time you 2 make a plan
like this, at least let me in on it.
You're compromising me.
Who knows what some girl is gonna squeeze out of you?
You're compromising me.
Who knows what some girl
is gonna squeeze out of you?
Where'd you get the bodies?
My freezer.
Come on. Wake up.
Yeah?
What the hell's going on?
Sir?
Get anything from The Frog?
No, he took some sorta poison
before we really talked.
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.
You've got to find Moses and Boggs.
Don't wory. l'm on the trail.
LONDON
On your right, you see
the famous Tower of London.
And shortly, we'll be passing
under the Tower Bridge.
It's a fortress.
It's an asylum for the criminally insane.
He's in the ICE unit.
That's an Ml6 Alpha
Level secure facility...
buried deep within that building.
It's like a prison within a prison.
How are we gonna get in there?
She wants my head!
It's a Papist plot.
It's that bitch May Queen
of Scots. She wants my head.
What are you doing? No!
Get me Cecil. l'm the Queen of England!
Don't take me to the Tower!
I'll have your head for this, you bitch!
No! No!
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."
They're plotting against me. All of them.
There's a good queen.
Stuff it, you old bat.
Thank you.
Not so much the "old", if you don't mind.
I think it was really good.
I thought l was channeling Bette Davis.
Good morning. Dr. Jones to
see prisoner number 1 7, please.
Dr. Jones? Are you with Ml6?
Certainly, not anymore.
I don't seem to have you on my list.
Bloody thing's not working. Why's that?
You're supposed to use
Lay down on the ground.
Attaboy. On the floor.
Number 121. There it is.
Frank!
Who are you? You're visitors?
Who are you looking for?
We love having visitors, don't we, fellas?
Dr. Bailey?
Doctor Bailey?
Yes. Who did you expect to find here?
Sir...
What?
I saw you die.
Saw me die? Who is he?
Frank?
Frank Moses, my dear fellow!
How are you, old sport?
So glad to see you. So glad you came by.
We've been expecting
you. Haven't we, fellas?
My God, why are you so old?
Good lord!
Sir...
What?
You've been locked up here for 32 years.
Frankie, you've gotta be
kidding me. Come on, put 'em up.
Victoria.
Victoria! You should read this.
Lenin. " State and Revolution."
Jolly good time. Stalin
got it wrong, of course.
Where are we going, Frank?
Are you taking us to the opera?
Is that where we're going? We
love the opera, don't we, fellas?
The opera and the champagne
and the strawberries all 'round.
Sory, my dear, what is your name again?
Victoria.
Sory, it's the drugs they're
feeding me, it's my short term memoy.
Something that's meant to
keep us peaceful or harmless!
Anmay, it's around here
somewhere, but l don't know where.
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.
Do you remember Nightshade?
I'm looking for my pipe and
my St. Christopher medallion.
Boys gave it to someone.
They were little boys.
And now it's gone somehow.
Oh shit!
Hey, Frankie, l'm over here.
I found it. It was in
my pocket the whole time.
I couldn't find my damn
pipe, though. But here it is.
Sory, my dear, what was
the question you asked me?
Do you remember Nightshade?
Vaguely. It was some
kind of a bomb, l believe.
People are looking for that
weapon. People who want to use it.
Oh dear. Yes, l do
understand ofcause. Believe me
But l made many things
for the Americans and...
Nightshade turned out to
be a bit of a nightmare.
It was quite different.
Turned out to be too dangerous.
So naturally, they had to
lock me up in this place.
And after what they did to me,
l think it's pe_ectly natural...
l tell them all to go F off!
Ml6 tried to fake Bailey's death?
Why? What are they hiding?
You're gonna have to go. You're
gonna have to go find out.
You know they're gonna ty and kill me.
I'll call you from Russia.
Maintenance to Bridge 7.
We got a breach in Maximum Security.
Secure!
What's so important?
I just heard from my source at Ml6 that
Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.
That's not possible.
This is bigger than a rogue general
and his unexploded ordinance.
What don't l know?
The game has changed.
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.
If Bailey or Nightshade fall into
terrorist hands, millions will die.
Holy shit, it's real.
Unless we secure it, that weapon's
going off in the middle of Moscow.
Right now, that's our best case scenario.
RUSSIA
Guys?
Welcome, my friends.
So, it is true. You're alive.
Tell me, then, where is this device?
Who?
Work in progress.
I never thought l'd be smuggling...
Frank Moses into the
heart of Mother Russia.
Me, neither.
Before l forget. A little something.
If you are caught or Han catches you...
suicide pill is a much better
option than what you face.
You die with Russian smile on.
Good luck.
Mr. Bailey.
Yes, Frank?
Is there any way you could tell us
where you hid the nuclear weapon?
Look at all those cows. They're beautiful.
Yeah.
Cows?
Hi! Yoo hoo!
That's not good.
MOSCOW
We have eyes on, Frank.
Where's my plane?
They paid me to kill you.
They didn't say l had
to do it all at once.
FREEZE
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD
THIS IS OFFICER BOESKY. OFFICER DOWN
WE NEED MEDICALASSISTANCE
FREEZE, HANDS ON YOUR HEAD
What's wrong with him?
Wow.
What is this place?
My first safe house.
Untouched, since 1984.
Fugu poison?
Fugu poison is deadly
stuff. Terrible death.
This little gizmo? XKG gas. l invented it.
We tried to take out old
Fidel Castro in '61 in Cuba.
That didn't work though.
Any tea, Frank?
Why does Han hate you so much?
Not enough hugs as a child.
Frank framed him for
stealing state secrets.
So he went from being a highly
decorated counter intel officer...
to being a pariah.
What's ironic is that Frank...
actually created the
circumstances for his own death.
It's poetic.
I ain't dead yet.
Should you eat that?
Is that safe?
It's before they had that,
you know, "sell by" date stuff.
Did you get to meet Castro?
Who?
Did you get to meet Castro?
Yes, l did. About 2 weeks
after Kennedy was assassinated.
Talking of which, Frank...
l'm starting to remember
more and more who l am...
and who l was and the weapons l made.
My God, it really is amazing.
How efficiently those boys
from Ml6, God bless 'em...
But they really do throw us
away. Don't they, old sport?
When we're no longer
convenient, l suppose.
As though we'd never given them
the best years of our lives.
Bit of a ioke, really.
Yes, vey strange.
Do you remember where Nightshade is?
I'm sory, my dear?
Do you remember where Nightshade is?
Oh, yes.
This feels right.
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.
Eveything looks different completely.
Maybe it's over here.
It's been hours.
Yeah, this is it.
Here we are.
How are those Jimmy
Choos working out for you?
The entrance is up there.
PAPA JOHN'S
Who's Papa John?
It's new.
Entrance to what?
Secret tunnels through the old catacombs.
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.
In where?
In there.
The Kremlin?
The weapon is in the Kremlin?
It's the one place they wouldn't look.
Jesus.Do you mind keeping it warm?
You have no idea the damage you've done.
You kept one of our own
locked up for 32 years.
I have kept the world safe.
If that weapon falls into the wrong hands
The weapon?
You haven't the slightest idea.
You must let me call Moses. He
doesn't know what he's walking into.
You've had your chance. It's over.
I'm sory, Victoria.
Sory, my ass.
They say you're a legend around here.
I've...
l've never heard of you.
Must have been a bit before my time.
You've heard of me now.
How is it possible they never picked up
the radiation signature from that bomb?
That's the million dollar question.
Hey, gang. This is new.
What do you think is behind that wall?
I think Russians.
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.
I'm gonna need you to help
me to disarm the weapon.
Somebody's gotta guard the door.
No.
But...
You'll need this.
COMRADE GENERAL
THIS IS RED SQUARE 20 MINUTES AGO
SECURITY SWEEP THE
BUILDING, GET THE ARMY NOW
One more time.
Great. What does that mean?
"Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."
Good. And then they'll move on.
What if they don't?
Want a gun?
Yes.
No gun.
Just don't move.
You're a security guard.
Don't smile. You can't smile.
You never leave your post. Okay?
Nice.
Drag the body in there
and repeat as necessay.
No safety.
No safety.
Frank, l don't like the Kremlin so much.
And l like being underneath it even less.
Here we are.
That's great. It's iust like yesterday.
There's my crow bar. Look at this.
There.
Hey, look, chaps.
That's my old pipe. l knew
l'd left it somewhere.
My dear wife bought this for me in
Oh yes!
This is Nightshade, by the way.
There.
Is that...?
That's Red Mercuy.
Red Mercuy?
We were always told
it was a Cold War myth.
Yes, they said it couldn't
be done, but l did it.
If that's Red Mercuy...
you can zip it up in a backpack
and take it on the White House tour.
It's undetectable.
No signature. No fallout.
This weapon will entirely change
the balance of international power...
overnight. Just like that.
We're all gonna die.
On your knees.
Katia.
No government should have this weapon.
Not yours. And not mine.
I have orders.
This isn't about orders.
This is about right and wrong.
Don't.
Did you really come to
see me in the States?
Yes.
What color were the
flowers outside my house?
Yellow.
I notice you are still
holding up the wall.
Gas Leak, maintenance is coming
l am Pasha.
You want to get a drink later?
Yes?
I thought perhaps you noticed me too!
What in the name of? Hey!
What are you doing kissing this guy?
I didn't wanna kill him.
What kinda stupid logic is that?
What in the Sam Hill is she doing here?
She's working with us again.
Like heck she is.
Why were you kissing that guy?
Kids, what happens in the
Kremlin stays in the Kremlin.
You are gonna have to explain this to me.
Hey, Comrades!
Here's to more success.
Success.
And saving the world!
Saving the world!
I got this. Right back.
Hey.
Where are you?
Moscow.
He's a nutter, Francis.
Ml6 didn't lock him up
because he created the weapon...
but because he wants to see it go off.
Hello, Frank.
That was Victoria, wasn't it?
Telling you that l was
some sort of a monster...
who once wanted to
destroy the Soviet empire.
Yeah. Vey slowly.
That's it. Good boy.
Good. In you go.
Marvin...
Guns down.
Weapons down. Vey slowly.
You planted the thing on WikiLeaks.
Yes, it was a cell
phone taken from a guard.
I was just itching to
get my revenge on Ml6.
Frank, you were absolutely
marvelous the way you found The Frog.
No one else could have found him.
Jack?
Sory, Frank, l made a deal already
with Mr. Gordon for Red Mercuy.
Well done, Bailey.
Thanks.
Nice to see you again.
Pick up the guns.
Your county appreciates your sacrifice.
But your time's up.
Let's go.
It's time, Bailey.
Yes, it is time.
Vey Interesting. Rogue American
agents turned nuclear terrorists...
kill top Russian officer.
Not good.
So long, Frank. So long, Marvin.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Easy.
Please, let me take that from you.
I thought we were doing
the debriefing in London.
We were.
But since you're such a sick, twisted
bastard, you're going to Colorado.
There's a secret facility
there, about a mile underground...
where you will spend
your remaining years...
having evey bit of knowledge
plucked from that giant head of yours.
Really?
Frankly, it will make your last 32 years...
seem like a vacation in the Caribbean.
Cuff him.
I say.
Well, well.
Bet you didn't see that
coming. Did you, old man?
I must say, l didn't. Jolly good. Bet you
didn't see that coming. Did you, old man?
I must say, l didn't. Jolly good.
After you.
Thank you.Good morning, gentlemen.
What did he say?
Ready.
Do something. Do something.
I love you.
At least Han didn't get us first.
Really? You're gonna
bring that up right now?
There is nothing more
sey in the whole world...
than a beautiful woman...
with an incredible gun.
You're such a romantic.
Watch your eyes.
Close your eyes.
I love the way your toes
curl right before you fire.
Hopeless.
Freeze.
I don't think you ought to
point that idiotic thing at me.
You should really start thinking
about your security protocol.
What the hell is that?
That my dear boy, is an antidote...
to the most powe_ul nerve
agent ever created. Look.
Hello, boys.
Hello, Mr. Davis.
And you didn't see that
coming. Did you, old sport?
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to miss what's coming ne_.
It's a little antidote. Jolly good.
That's right.
Good. Thank you.
Jolly good.
Honestly, Frank, 2 days and
you're in front of a firing squad?
Yeah. But look...
No excuses. You're better
than this. It's pathetic.
An American militay transport
made an emergency landing in London.
Eveyone aboard was found dead.
Bailey has taken refuge
in the Iranian embassy.
The Iranian embassy? Bailey has taken
refuge in the Iranian embassy.
The Iranian embassy?
We've gotta go there.
Alright. Get 'em ready.
I'm gonna make sure
we're cleared for takeoff.
If the world is here in a week...
l will meet you in the Turks and Caicos.
And we will spend all night...
beneath the stars.
I don't speak Korean!
You having fun yet?
I'll let you know when l start having fun.
You betrayed me.
I had no choice.
You'd have done the same
thing, if you were me.
How much is the US paying you?
Are you kiddin' me?
I asked for more.
What happened to you?
You used to be a good agent.
Stop! Wait a minute.
Listen, l need your help.
I know there's a part of you
that wants to do the right thing.
There is a weapon that's
gonna be detonated...
Bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
There's a bomb headed
for London right now.
their lives if you don't help me.
Alright.
Let's go.
This doesn't mean l'm not
going to kill you later.
I know.
I think the way to make
a relationship work...
is that neither of you
give up who you are.
Don't you agree, Marvin?
Exactly. Exactly what Marvin says.
Falling in love is like
jumping off a cliff.
You iust have to believe and let go.
My God!
Are you okay?
No, he's alright.
He's with us.
We talked it out.
Kill Bailey. Secure the
weapon. How hard can it be?
The e_ernal security is vey hea_ but...
inside there are hardcore
Revolutionay Guards.
They are serious fanatics.
The whole thing depends on her.
You do realize, if they
catch you, they will kill you.
LONDON
l know this won't be easy
for you, but don't wory.
Okay?
I've been thinking about...
you and me.
And l iust...
l got you something.
Wow.
You like it?
I love it.
Okay.
Not yet. l'm not ready.
Stop, no.
Not right now. Wait.
If you don't do it, you're
gonna blow it. Look at me.
I'm gonna count to 3. In English.
Not now. No. Wait.
God damn it.
Hi.
She's gonna get killed.
It's tough when they leave the nest.
Frank, come on. A little trust.
She has talents you and l will never have.
What talents?
People like her.
If she lives, this'll be
good for your relationship.
You're right.
And if there's one thing l
know, it's women and covert ops.
That's 2 things.
No, grasshopper.
It is not.
I wanna tell you a secret, Mr. Minister.
Is she gonna make out with this guy, too?
What the hell was that?
Blomish poison.
Paralysis and shooting pains
will grip your entire body.
And you will slowly asph_iate
until you choke to death...
while remaining fully conscious,
unless you do exactly what l say.
I will die before l compromise my county.
We will drive you to your office...
where you will write a letter
on official stationey...
denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.
Then you will get your antidote.
Denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.
Then you will get your antidote.
That's it?
IRANIAN EMBASSY, LONDON
How may l help you?
I would like to defect to Iran.
Dr. Bailey, my apologies for the delay.
Professor Dombrovski has
declared the weapon authentic.
And we're prepared to proceed.
As soon as my money's
transferred, Mr. Ambassador.
Move! She's with me.
Arman?
He needs to go.
Okay, okay.
What are you talking about? Who is she?
Sir, l'm sory, you need to leave.
You need to shut up!
No.
What is happening here?
What are you doing?
Tell me what is happening
here! Who is she?
Get out! When l say "get
out", get out of here!
You need to go!
You shut the fuck up!
Where's the safe?
What?
Where's the safe?
Poo poo's coming.
Hury. Emergency.Water
eve_here. Come quick.
Stop! Plumbers, wait!
It's okay! This way.
Money received.
Good show.
Let's see our friend here.
Would you lend me your knife, please?
Thank you.
Sory about the mess on the carpet.
Oh well.
At this point, Jack... You don't
mind me calling you "Jack", l hope.
You must be beginning to comprehend...
the stunning totality of your failure.
You can't give it to them.
I've no more interest in giving
Red Mercuy to these boys...
than l have in giving it to you.
Jesus.
Yes, it's a sad old world.
Anmay, that's only my opinion.
But the central point is this...
when men like you and
those dickheads from Ml6...
or CIA or whatever sewers you came from.
When you take away not only my life...
but the innocent lives of my
dear beloved wife Natasha...
and my little boy, who was only 6.
What can l say?
When you mess with me, buddy...
this is what you get.
Go to hell, old man.
Fare thee well, patriot.
Boom.
Now what's ne_?
Ah, Washington.
Baby, hey.
Are you okay?
Awesome!
Oh shit.
Is that it?
It's counting down, Frank.
Shut if off.
Shut Yeah. With what? Acupressure?
I don't know.
Why is it my responsibility?
Just do something.
With my Mr. Chemisty set?
I don't know what l'm doing.
You want me to push a button?
Bailey's loose and the bomb's ticking.
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.
Hello, l have an appointment.
Gun!
Get that bomb outta here.
Drop it now, darling. That's right.
My gun!
Press the button. Ground floor.
Marvin, let's go!
Jolly good show.
Bollocks.
You really drive this ridiculous thing?
Can you shoot?
We need eyes, Francis.
Come on, Frank. 40 minutes.
How ya doin' back there?
I can't talk to you right now.
How is it?
It's fine.
Shit!
Show me something.
Victoria...
l got eyes on. Bailey's
heading for the M4.
Got it.
Got it!
This one should stop it and
this one should detonate it.
It's fifty fifty.
Wait!
That's weird.
Do you have any idea what you're doing?
Wait, wait!
Stop cutting wires!
I knew we were gonna die!
Ready to kill this son of a bitch?
Abso bloody lutely.
Damn it!
Trouble.
Marvin!
It's 2 pedals and 2 sticks.
Okay.
Damn it! We missed him.
He's going into the airport.
Go get him!
Where are you?
In trouble.
Turn back! You are in restricted airspace.
They're gonna blow us outta the sky.
I wouldn't wory about that.
The engine's shutting down.
Mayday! Mayday!
Frank!
I knew we were gonna die!
This is your last warning!
Please, tell me you're not crashing
with a weapon of mass destruction.
No, Frank, no.
Oh God.
You okay back there?
It wasn't exactly a three
point landing, Frank.
How's the bomb doing?
I can't stop it.
We gotta get it outta here.
Hey!
Get outta the car.
Hello, Frank.
Welcome aboard.
Always the good soldier, aren't you?
Stalemate.
How will you take him out...
and not shoot her first?
Frank, it's okay.
You can shoot. It's okay.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!
Drop the gun!
Put the gun down, Frankie.
Thank you.
Pretty smart.
So love does conquer all.
Go to your golden warrior.
That's a good girl.
Come here.
It's so sweet.
Now leave the plane.
Take Nightshade with you.
Bye, Frank.
Sweet dreams.
Why didn't you iust shoot me?
What happened?
I couldn't disarm it.
Crap.
Marvin...
it's going to detonate?
Yeah.
Put your arms around me.
Oh...
l didn't see that one coming.
There's something you don't see evey day.
You put the bomb on the plane.
And you didn't think to mention that?
You blew up my plane.
Sory.
I was wrong? So we're not even gonna die?
Not yet.
I was actually starting to like you.
I was even thinking about not killing you.
This is what happens when
you ty to save the world.
You can't put a price on these things.
You owe me 30 mil for the plane.
And 20 for not killing you.
You're a dead man, Moses.
Thanks for your help.
Really.
You think he means it?
Nah, he's a nice guy.
I mean it, Frank!
Alright.
They're going to be right as rain.
He made the run to emotional safety.
So...
l did hear about this iob in Caracas.
And?
Don't look at me. She's your girlfriend.
Come on.
