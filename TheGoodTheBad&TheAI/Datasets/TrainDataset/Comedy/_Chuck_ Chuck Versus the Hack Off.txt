Here are a few things that
you might need to know.
You need to learn there are
repercussions for your actions.
- For what?
- Attempted homicide.
John Casey, you're
under arrest for murder.
How are you holding up?
Well, the government
I proudly served for 20 years
has locked me up with
the scum of the earth.
I'm great.
Hold out your hand.
What is that?
We have a plan
to get you out of here.
- Just take it, okay?
Do you have any idea
how hard it is
to shrink blueprints
down to this size?
The guy at Kinkos
thought I was crazy.
Put that away. I am not
breaking out of prison.
Casey, there is a very strong
case against you.
Escape might be your only option
to get your life back.
If I break out of prison,
I'm a fugitive.
I don't run from the law.
I am the law!
Now, Decker has me in here
for a reason.
I'm gonna sit tight,
keep my head down,
you figure out
what his angle is, okay?
Fine.
You gonna be
okay in here?
Yeah... if that one
doesn't drive me insane.
Okay, I admit it,
I tried to poison you
to keep you subordinate.
What is the big deal?
I could have died.
But you didn't!
All right, look,
recently I put some people
that I care about through a...
through some rough times.
That's the thing:
true friendship is,
uh, it's confusing, isn't it?
Mm. Look, guys, please, just,
ah, tell me what I have to do
to get out of this place.
It's so simple.
Okay, Jeff has agreed
to drop all charges
under one condition.
Okay.
You promise not to poison
him anymore.
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I can't promise that.
Wake up, man! You are gonna get
yourself killed in this...!
You know what? It doesn't
matter. I don't care, all right?
Good luck in prison.
You know what?
No, good luck to you both
finding a better Indian guy
in your life
or at the Buy More!
I will see you both in hell!
Which is just what I call
"visiting hours."
John, let's go back inside,
bench press some poundage.
I'm gonna look
like a Hindu Michelangelo
by the time I get out of here.
Why, you...
John, move!
I told him I was in here
for parking tickets.
It takes every fiber of my body
not to drop that barbell
right on his throat.
Visiting hours are now over.
I gotta get back in there.
Check into Decker,
but be careful.
He's capable of anything.
Thank you.
I can't help feeling
like Casey going
to prison
is all my fault.
What? Why would
you say that?
'Cause I'm the genius who
started the private spy company
and convinced you both
to work with me.
Chuck, that's not true.
Decker wanted Casey in jail
no matter what.
I mean, whether we worked
for ourselves or the CIA,
it doesn't really matter.
And I'm not just saying that
to make you feel better.
Well, maybe a little.
Thank you.
Chuck, you've got...
Sarah, you got a...
Oh, no.
Sorry for the theatrics
getting you here.
Sometimes it's
just more fun
to knock somebody out
and toss them in a van.
Why'd you bring us here?
I need you to do a job for me.
You throw our partner
in jail
and now you want
a favor from us?
In exchange, I will make all
of his charges disappear.
Think of Mr. Casey as a
giant slab of leverage.
We all know that stubborn
bastard will rot in prison
unless I say otherwise.
You have the entire CIA
under your thumb. Why us?
This mission involves some
extremely dangerous
technological terrorism.
Sure, I have agents
who can write code,
but none who can do
it as well as you can
and handle themselves
in the field.
There's no room for error here.
We need you.
Okay, we're listening.
We've been tracking a computer
supervirus named the "Omen."
Tech has only able to uncover
bits and pieces,
but they assured me they've
never seen anything like it:
metamorphic code capable
of erasing
per second.
What does any of that mean?
It means that this virus could
essentially wipe out
every database in the world in,
oh, five seconds.
And just as we were
zeroing in on its origin,
all signs of it disappeared.
That's why I need you.
Locate the Omen, bring it back
to me, Mr. Casey goes free.
And what if we say no?
I have men on the inside
who can make your friend's life
a living hell.
Though, to be honest,
I imagine hell will have no
trouble finding him in there.
No fights.
Keep your nose clean.
Harder than I thought.
What do you think
you're doing, inmate?!
Sorry if I got too physical.
It's the uniform.
Don't apologize.
I actually enjoyed it.
Thought you would.
Look, I'm glad you came
to see me.
I have something
to discuss with you.
Uh-uh! I'm all for business,
but first,
wouldn't you like
to take advantage of your
state-given right?
What right is that?
A conjugal visit.
I would very much like
to take advantage of that right.
I thought you might.

I'm assuming you don't want
to stay over.
Maybe next time.
What's on your mind?
Listen, Bartowski and Walker
are damn good spies,
but I don't like that
they're down a man,
especially if Decker is up
to something.
So you want me my team
to track them?
Make sure they're safe?
Not your team, you.
I figured you could take
my place.
Right, I'm gonna take orders
from Ward and June Cleaver.
It was just a suggestion.
Well, stop making suggestions.
Okay. I'm done.
It is hard to say no to you.
I know.
I hate this.
I mean, do you remember
why we started
Carmichael Industries
to begin with?
Corporate discount on the
pinball machine, right?
Ha. We did it to gain
independence.
And where are we now?
Beholden to Decker,
the exact type of person
we said we'd never deal
with again.
Stop it.
You know we're doing
this to find Casey.
I know, I know.
All right, let's find us
a virus, shall we?
Uh, what is happening?
Is that,
is that chardonnay?
I haven't seen this
in a long time.
We used to call this routine
"The Routine."
That's very creative.
Yeah.
Yeah, Chuck has
quite a reputation
as a hacker,
you know?
They used to call him
"The Piranha."
The movie is based on him.
He doesn't like
to talk about it 'cause he doesn't
think it was a A-plus film.
Why? I thought
it was pretty good.
Yeah, it's okay, but it had
a lot of plot holes
and those hacker scenes
were just, like...
Someone coded the name
into the Telix-script!
A little inside joke for anyone
running viral countermeasures.
When The Piranha got really
into a coding session,
he could get a bit giddy.
Yeah, it's kind of cute.
Yeah, it's also super nerdy.
It's definitely that, too.
Got it!
The name was encrypted.
So I ran an elliptic curve
algorithm to find the key.
And of course after that,
it was cake.
Well, hello, Colin Davis--
the man behind the Omen virus.
Coming your way
in three, two, one.
Guy was a head programmer
at The Collective;
a rogue group of technological
terrorists who sold viruses
to the highest bidder.
Three months ago, he disappeared
with the key to the virus.
Drop off the grid
crazy-guy style. I like that.
Well, Mr. Colin Davis,
let's see
if you left us any clues
as to where you went.
Mm-hmm. Shoot. I promised Jeff
that I was gonna help him
with this whole Lester thing.
All right, guys,
you'll be okay here.
Oh, make sure
that he eats.
When he gets all plugged in,
he goes overboard
with the chardonnay.
Calls it his
"thinking juice."
Ah?
Ah.
Thanks, buddy!
Love you!
How's the brain, Mr. Grimes?
It's, uh, it's
okay, Thanks.
Casey sent me to help
with this Decker situation.
So, if you'll be so kind
as to take me to the newlyweds.
I can't, I can't bring
guests down to Castle.
Are you really gonna
make me use this?
You'd shoot me?
I'd beat you over
the head with it.
Well, this is Davis's
last known location.
He must have brought
the virus here.
Some kind of encampment
behind this barrier.
It looks like some sort
of separatist compound.
There could be a militia
training back there.
Mm, Casey would have
loved this mission.
And you're aware
that you're going
to get yourselves killed
without Casey?
I decided to let her in after
we had an adult conversation.
What are you doing here,
Verbanski?
Ease up, I'm not here to steal
any of your "precious secrets."
I'm here because I'm going
on this mission with you.
Oh, is that right?
Look, we both want
Casey out of jail.
You want
your partner back and I...
I-I hate to see the competition
struggle like this.
As far as I can tell, you need
a sniper on this mission.
I've done some
pretty amazing
sniper work
on Call of Duty.
I believe I've made my point.
Well, the sniper rifles are
behind you in the armory.
I'll bring my own.
Things can get really
nasty really fast,
if you're not running
with the crowd in here.
Is that a fact?
You know, you look like
you can use some friends.
And we could use some muscle
like you in the yard.
I'll expect your
answer tonight.
Dude, this place is no joke.
Especially for a guy
with unpaid parking tickets.
What do you want?
I know how
to survive in prison.
You gotta be
the shot-caller,
and I think I've figured out
a way to do that.
You know, Caged Heat was
a women's prison movie.
Well, the lessons remain
the same, John.
Hey, homes.
Got that 12-gauge
you wanted, man.
Word.
Drop it in my cell.
Done.
All right.
Easier than I thought.
That sounds like some kind
of military drill.
I'll look for cover.
Get ready for action.
Okay, this is definitely
not a militia...
Sarah, Sarah, I think
we walked into a cult.
Way ahead of you.
Strip. Now.
What-What-What-What?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Joining a cult.
Strip. Come on.
Now keep a close eye.
I really have
no place
to hide a gun.
Not too close
an eye, though.
I'm serious, for real,
no looking, thank you.
Calm down.
No one's looking at anything.
Not much to look at, anyway.
That is not fair.
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.
Children...
are you lost?
Can I help the new arrivals
find their way?
Uh, we were told to come
here to seek enlightenment.
Then enlightenment
you shall find.
Please... help yourself
to some robes.
Welcome...
to the Church of
the Eternal Wind.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
We'll just...
We have uninvited guests.
Find out who they are.
We have a situation.
It's a little...
little chilly under here.
These are very
short robes, huh?
Well, the church believes
that the spirit
enters from underneath.
Well, that's a totally
natural entry point.
Uh, that's
an interesting pendant.
I imagine it has some kind
of significance for you?
All members of the church
wear a pendant
to remind them of
their past lives.
I worked on Wall Street,
lived the fast life.
Till I came here.
Not looking for
a life story here.
Figure out where Davis is,
locate the virus.
My patience is wearing thin.
You know, my wife and I
were looking for an escape
from our everyday chaos,
and then our friend
Colin Davis recommended we come
and check out
your church here.
Oh, Colin-- what
a caring man.
Now we call him Moon Meadow.
That's his wind name.
Uh, do you know where we could
find Moon Meadow?
We'd love to see him.
Mm.
I believe he's leading a
drum circle, in the garden.
It's mostly free-form,
experimental drumming.
There'll definitely be
some jamming as well.
Sounds like fun.
Yeah! Let's go
check it out. Okay.
Hey. How you
holding up, man?
I didn't think it would
be this hard without
Lester around.
I'm starting to forget him.
I can't even picture what
Lester looks like anymore.
Close your eyes.
Imagine David Beckham.
Lester's a shorter,
feminine version of his wife.
Right.
I can see him now.
Yeah.
Look, when I went through
my dark period,
I alienated
a lot of friends.
But thankfully, for me,
I was able to realize
what I was about to lose,
before it was too late.
We just have to make
sure he knows
what's slipping
away here.
I totally get it.
This reminds me of the time
my dad tried to win back my mom
when he heard she was having sex
with Uncle Steve.
They ended up
as a threesome.
I had a messed-up
childhood.
Yeah, you did.
But, you know what?
It actually gives me
a great idea
how to handle Lester.
It's not a threesome.
These people dropped everything
and came here.
- Can you imagine?
- Yeah, it's crazy.
I mean, I don't know what
I'd do if I left the spy life.
Sometimes I'm so
caught up in it,
I can't think of a
world outside of it.
Well, you're really good
at computers, Chuck.
I mean, you love them.
Yeah... maybe.
I got eyes on Davis.
I'm in position
to shoot any and all
of these filthy hippies.
It's almost like
Casey never left.
Okay, stay focused.
This is over as soon
as we find the virus.
So let's just
get in and get out.
I found
their clothes.
And these were
with them.
Chuck, Casey needs us.
Wrap up the Phish concert,
make a move.
All right!
You got some skills.
As do you, my friend.
All right.
So, uh, you worked
in tech, huh?
Oh... a lifetime ago.
And this-- this would've been
my crowning achievement.
Till I walked away.
You know, I used to work
in computers, as well.
You mind if I take
a look at that?
Oh, no, no, I couldn't.
It's against church policy
to ever remove your pendant.
But I do take it off
twice a month, when I shower.
Ah!
Intruders! We have intruders!
We've been made.
You get the chip, I'll take care
of the guards.
After her-- go, go, go!
Hey, stop!
Leave me alone!
Colin!
Colin, I'm trying to help you!
God help me!
Stop!
Too much tree cover.
I don't have a shot.
I'm coming down.
Get away!
Go away!
I don't like this!
Some of our members
have a checkered past.
They pay a lot of money
for enlightenment,
as well as protection.
Looks like you walked
into the wrong cult, bitch.
Colin!
Oh...!
It's okay...
I vowed never to let anybody
have this virus,
no matter what I had to do.
Davis...
No, no, stop!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Get it out of there!
Give me the chip!
Give me the chip!
Davis? Davis?
Where's the chip?
I hid it.
Inside him.
So he swallowed it.
Yes, he did.
Hey! Honey!
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Never better.
Good. I need your help.
Davis swallowed the chip.
We gotta get him
out of here now.
Okay, let's cover up his-- guys,
can we find him some pants?
Decision time.
You gonna join us?
Not interested.
Thought you might say that.
Hey!
Hey!
You touch one
hair on his head,
and I will pull your plug.
Mark my words, son.
Step back or your nights
will get real long.
Real long.
Step back!
What the hell?
I told you,
I figured out a way to become
the shot caller in here.
Now, any of these people
get out of line,
I will pull their plugs.
Literally, I'll pull
their plugs.
I've been using
my Buy More skills
to set up cable and Internet
for the inmates.
Of course you have.
In fact, I just got a shipment
of 12-gauge electrical wire
that is making
installations a snap.
Now these monsters
are petrified
'cause I can take their
tech away at any moment.
That sounds like
a good plan.
I know.
All right, I'll see
you in the yard.
Please let me go.
This is a mistake.
Look, um, I promise you
we're not gonna hurt you.
We just need to wait
for the chip to...
you know, complete its journey,
and then you can go free.
No, you don't understand.
The virus is too dangerous
to be released into the world.
It could wipe out everything.
I knew I should've
destroyed it, but...
it was my finest work.
You know,
I just... couldn't.
Hey, uh...
I understand.
It's just, I tried to get
out of that life, you know,
and now it's sucking me back in.
It's like I'm trying
to outrun something
I shouldn't have done
in the first place.
I get it, Colin.
Believe me, I do.
And I assure you,
we're the good guys here.
I hope to God
you're telling me the truth.
There are two parts
to the virus:
a chip and
a distribution device--
it's like a modded
USB drive.
You insert the chip
into the device,
and the virus
can be uploaded...
to any system.
I'm hoping you didn't
swallow the device, as well.
No, it's still locked up
at The Collective,
my former employer.
Right. Right,
right, right.
Uh, so-so what you're saying
then is we just need to
sneak past a few hackers
and get the device back?
No, it's not that easy.
There are some
extremely dangerous people
selling these viruses.
Can you help us get in?
Best I can do is access
the schematics of the building,
show you where they're
storing the device.
Okay, great.
That's a great start.
Thank you.
I'll go grab a computer.
Listen, is there anything
I can get you while I'm up?
Our kitchen's fully stocked.
Sandwich? Nachos?
We have some of those
gourmet jellybeans.
You have the kind that tastes
like buttered popcorn?
I think I can make that happen.
A snack?
Casey's in lockdown,
and this jerk
wants jellybeans?
We should just cut him open
and get that chip out right now.
You know, I know that we're not
partners or friends
or anything like that,
but are you okay?
You seem to be on
edge ever since
we started the mission.
I'm fine.
Really? 'Cause we can
talk about it if you want.
No, no, no, no.
We-We don't talk, okay?
I'm-I'm just off.
Stop trying to be
my shrink.
Okay.
Is it, um... about Casey?
I just noticed that you have
some emotions for him.
Can we stop with this garbage
and just get to work?
You know, you can still
have feelings for somebody
and still be a good spy.
Oh, and be like you
and Mr. Hospitality?
That's my fate?
No.
No, no, no.
So I've been noticing
Lester popping up online
about the same
time every day.
Fancy prison.
Yeah, right.
So, look, we
initiate a chat,
and then we begin Operation:
Scare Lester Straight.
Ready?
Hello, friends.
Guess you couldn't
live without me, huh?
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
to tell you this,
but, uh, we've been
interviewing people
to fill your spot
at the Buy More.
Oh, come on. Right.
What, are you gonna
just-just replace me?
Actually, he just
showed up.
Who is this fool?
This is our new Nerd Herder,
Vali Chandrasekaren.
Oh, come on!
That is a pretty stupid name.
Where are you from,
Mr. Fake Name?
Look at my face.
You can't tell I'm from
Montreal, like all true Hinjews?
Oh, no, you did not.
I did. And I am.
Listen, I just wanted
to say thanks
for giving up your spot
at the Buy More.
Some great people here.
I'm excited to start
getting to know everybody.
Lester, you should hear
this guy's singing voice.
Like an angel.
Come on.
It really is though.
O Canada
That's just a little bit,
you know.
My word.
You know, many people say
it's the type of voice
that would go perfectly
with a-- I don't know-- keytar.
May I have a moment alone
with Jeffrey, please?
Of course.
Sure, sure.
Well done, well done.
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
You nailed it.
Your voice-- wow, you
really underplayed it.
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah.
You earned this.
Okay, this one's just Wi-Fi.
You know, the Indian Modeling
Agency, they said that
you'd give me one of the good
ones if I helped you out, so...
You know this comes
out of my salary.
Don't care one bit.
Jackpot!
Who's the new guy?
Don't worry about it.
I'll find out myself.
You know, it is amazing.
They're like little
popcorn pills, you know?
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
He agreed to help us.
I just wanted to extend
our full hospitality
to our guest, make sure
he's perfectly comfortable
while we wait
patiently for the chip.
I was just telling
your partner...
He's not my
partner. Go on.
The Collective has
an unbreakable security system.
But it does have one weakness.
It can be
manipulated
from the inside.
Man, these jellybeans
taste... funny.
Just speeding up
the process a little bit.
You've got something
on your shirt.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Keep it in the can.
Keep it in the trash can.
What do you think?
Do I look like a hacker?
Is the beanie overkill?
You look perfect.
Okay, I found a duct opening
on the east corner,
just below the roof.
Okay, we have our entry.
At exactly 2200 hours,
we'll be in the server room,
waiting for you to override
the security system.
Got it.
Be careful, babe.
You, too.
I'm here for a job.
You realize what happens
if you don't get the job?
I do.
Welcome to The
Collective,
the very best of
the very best.
You said you
want a job.
Let's prove it.
Sit.
Okay.
Hi.
Freddie is my
best programmer.
If you can
prove your skills
up against him,
then you have the job.
But if you fail...
...you might not be
so fortunate.
So, a good old-fashioned
hack off, huh?
Great. Perfect.
I'm just gonna take a moment to
get prepared,
if you don't-don't mind.
Boom.
Oh, once you've had Rombauer,
you just can't go back
to any other Chardonnay.
Who are you?
I've been out of the
game for a little while,
but they used to call me
The Piranha.
There's no way.
Let's do this, huh?
Okay,
the first person
that hacks
into Federal Reserve
and transfers
one penny into
secure account wins.
Are we clear?
Begin!
Freddie's an expert
at subverting complex
security systems.
He is the reason our own system
is so secure.
Oh, yeah, I can tell.
He did a great job.
That's my man.
You seem to know your way
around a computer.
I'm sorry, are we still talking?
I'm kind of busy here.
You know what? You actually have
a little hiccup there
at the bottom
of your page.
A compiler can't optimize
a value away like that.
Just want to...
Yeah, there you go.
Rookie mistake.
I'm sure it won't happen again.
Oh, I'm losing!
Better get back
to work.
I forgot something.
I'm really good at this!
The servers are in
here somewhere.
Can we pull up the schematics?
Verbanski?
Fine, I love Casey!
Just, just geez,
stop grilling me!
So, do you want
to talk about it?
You know, I've just
been a wreck
since Casey went
to prison.
I had no idea I had such
strong feelings for him,
and now I'm petrified
this could actually
turn into something.
Well, maybe you're looking
at it the wrong way.
What, we're gonna become
a couple, have some kids,
and then I gotta quit
the spy business
because it's
too dangerous?
Relationships are
all about communication.
Big life changes
don't really just
spring up on you
like that.
Hey, stop!
I couldn't imagine
life away from this
Do you really think
it's gonna be that bad?
Sarah, girls like us, we don't
just leave the spy business.
Look at me, I've
been doing this
since I was
I never had another job,
not my entire life.
I wouldn't even know
what to do if I did.
Stop right there!
How about you?
Could you do anything else?
Thanks.
This might be it.
Chuck, I've got the device.
Let's get out of here.
Thanks for the help.
Hope you enjoyed losing.
Done!
One penny transferred out
of the Federal Reserve
into a secure account.
Easy.
Hmm.
A little too easy if you ask me.
And honestly,
who wanta penny, right?
So...
I hacked into the Buy More
and got us all flat screens.
Whoo!
With extended warranties, I might add.
You are clearly very talented.
Unfortunately, I don't care
that you are
talented.
We have all the flat screens
that we need.
Whoa-uh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Before you use that I've got
a little business tip for you.
And what is that?
You should really look
into finding
a better security expert.
Freddie! Alarms!
Fixed it!
Find him!
Guys, I'm in trouble!
Coming your way!
I don't think I got the job.
Let's get out of here.
Go, go, go!
Your plan worked.
As soon as Lester saw
the other better Lester,
he changed his tune.
That's fantastic!
He said he wouldn't
poison me anymore,
so I dropped the charges.
He'll be back at
work tomorrow.
Mm, man,
I can't wait.
This wasn't really about
me and Lester, was it?
Mm, I don't know.
There's someone who hasn't
forgiven your dickish behavior.
And you need
to right that wrong.
I'm talking about
John Casey.
I know, dude.
I'm not brain damaged.
I'm sorry. Too soon?
That's... I don't...
You want me
to do the talking?
No. It was supposed to be
me and Chuck.
We don't want to do anything
to spook Decker.
You should probably
make yourself scarce.
So, I've been, uh,
I've been thinking about life
after the spy game.
What do you mean?
You know, maybe you're right;
I'm, I'm great with computers.
I mean, maybe Carmichael
Industries isn't a spy firm.
Maybe it's a tech company.
What do you think?
Sarah?
Uh, what would my job be
at Carmichael Industries?
I mean, what would I do?
Well, you'd...
He's here.
Did you bring the virus?
The deal, it's still good?
John Casey goes free?
Here.
What are you planning
on doing with it?
This?
The real question is,
what do you plan
to do with it, Chuck?
What are you
talking about?
I got some good footage of you
and your team in possession
of the most dangerous computer
virus in the world.
Smile.
Don't worry, we'll release
the virus,
but you'll get the blame.
That should get you
on the FBI's
most wanted list
pretty quickly.
So, this was a setup.
You set us up?
You know,
now that I think of it,
it was pretty irresponsible
to release Casey
into the hands
of his criminal colleagues.
That's enough
of this nonsense.
You release Casey now.
Gertrude, what's happening
is bigger than just me.
The Plan is in motion.
It's too late
for all of you.
It's just a shame that Casey had
to be the first to die.
Give me one reason
not to kill you.
Go ahead.
It will only further prove
your guilt.
So, I suggest
you get your hands off me
and get a little head start,
because soon, people
will be hunting Chuck,
the way they hunted Bin Laden.
Go.
Let's go.
Let's go right now.
Hey, Decker.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Don't worry, I left
a little consolation prize.
He deserved that.
Go. Go, go, go! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
It was all a setup, huh?
Chuck was gonna
be the fall guy,
and you were never
getting out of here alive.
John, your team needs you now.
Okay.
What do we do about Decker?
I already took care of him.
You didn't.
I have to disappear for a while.
I understand.
We could've been something.
Still can be.
Perhaps someday.
Surveillance changes
shifts in two minutes.
So we gotta get into
the heating duct
before they realize
that you're gone.
You're gonna break me
out of here alone?
No. I found someone who cares
about you as much as I do.
Prisoner transfer
from CB-11, section 38.
Copy that.
I missed you, big guy.
What plan was Decker
talking about?
Why would he want
to frame you?
I don't know,
but I intend
to find out.
If he was telling the truth,
then we're already
in deeper than we know.
Sarah, I was wrong about
quitting the spy life.
Because right now,
we've got to be the best
spies we've ever been, okay?
