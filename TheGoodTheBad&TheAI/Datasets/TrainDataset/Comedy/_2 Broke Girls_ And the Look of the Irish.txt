The Sad Lady Book Club is reading
again.
There's not a dry seat in the house.
If those ladies are that
into light torture,
they should just apply for our jobs.
-
- Hey.
Aww, you two are so adorable.
Like Romeo and Juliet, but
without the bright future.
Yeah...
I want him out of the diner.
What are you talking about?
Anyone who works in this diner
is like a fat guy in a smart car.
You can never get out.
It's true.
I came in here in 1962
for a cup of coffee.
Someone asked me to break
a dollar, and I never left.
Look. Living, working, and
sleeping with the same guy
is never a good idea.
Just talk to Hillary Clinton.
I guess I can get a dishwasher fired.
When I was rich, I got Wolfgang
Puck fired from Wolfgang Puck.
Get yours, Max!
Hit it then quit it.
That strategy served me
well in my 20s and 30s.
Evening, ladies.
Also, my 70s.
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh

- Pick up.
Or don't.
Who gives a crap?
Well, someone's in a bad mood.
What's wrong, Oleg?
Did they discontinue
making Axe body spray?
Don't even kid.
No. I'm cranky because I'm
not having sex right now.
Yeah. I thought it was weird
seeing both your hands
while you were talking.
Sophie's idea. It's
some old Polish ritual.
The bride and groom
remain chaste for 30 days
before the wedding.
Apparently, the "something
blue" at the wedding
has got to be my balls.
So, you're practicing celibacy.
I'm trying, but there
are women everywhere.
I feel like a bull in a vagina shop.
Hear ye, hear ye!
I'm unveiling a major
improvement to the diner!
Well, we'll miss you, Han.
Nice try, Max, but like Ryan Seacrest,
I'll be here forever.
Now, will you all please do what
you have yet to do on Twitter
and follow me?
You too, Earl.
Hell, this better be good.
Every step I take could be my last.
And now...
Without further a-douche...
Ready to have your minds blown?
At this point, I'm ready
to have anything blown.
Ta-da!
That is the worst gift I ever received
and last year, my son
bought me a coffin.
This works out great then,
because it's not for you.
It's for Nash.
Oh, well, that's real nice.
Because the shower at Max's
place doesn't work at all.
You better believe it's nice.
That's the Spritzy 5000.
gave it
four out of four Dishies.
You know our oven doesn't work, right?
Hey, boss lady, if we work
hard, do we get a gift?
If you work hard, I'll die childless
with my mouth frozen open in shock.
Yeah, I went there!
Nash works hard, so only he
may handle my beautiful hose!
Well, if he's handling Han's hose,
he's never getting fired.
Okay. Step up here, Nash.
I'll show you what this puppy can do.
So far the puppy can't reach the hose.
A little help.
Aww, there's nothing cuter
than a hot guy holding a baby.
Now just grab that thing and
squeeze it till it sprays.
Move to call a moratorium on
the words "grab," "squeeze,"
and "sprays" till the wedding.
Damn! That's hot.
And me without any singles
to stuff down his pants.
Well, I better go dry
off in the men's room.
Don't be too long in that stall.
I've got a date with the Land
O'Lakes butter package lady
on my next break.
Oh. Pardon me, ladies. I'm all wet.
Max? Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Those ladies looking at him
like he's a senior special
at Sizzler's?
We might not be able to get Nash fired,
but we can get him hired
as a fashion model.
Look at their faces.
He could be the future
bulge of Calvin Klein.
Now you're talking about the future?
Why can't you just
accept that we are stuck
with a really crappy present?
Quit trash-talking the Spritzy 5000!
Good afternoon. Welcome to The High.
I'll have somebody get you some water.
Not me, 'cause I'm past that.
You know, here.
I think I just sat another one
of those lesbian blind-dates
for our boss.
It's hard out there for a pimp.
Why do you think I got out of pimping?
That and someone broke a
beer bottle over my head.
So, did you get Nash a modeling job yet?
I'm working on it.
It's not like I can
just call Tyra Banks.
Well, that's what her
people said when I called.
Ugh, phone therapy ran long.
Apparently I have more
issues than I realized
about Rosie leaving
Are my dates here yet?
Please don't tell me
it's her, her, or her.
It's her, her, and her.
Lose them.
How am I supposed to get rid of them?
Just say what anyone says when
they want a lesbian to leave,
"There's a Subaru outside
that's about to get a ticket."
If you had you told me, ten years ago,
I'd be on a dating site
called "Lez Meet Up,"
I would've told the youth
pastor I was married to,
"You've lost your mind."
Oh, I just got some interest
from the Del Monico Modeling Agency.
But for the interview, he needs photos.
And not just the pictures
of his butt on your phone.
Fine, you handle it.
The only thing I know about modeling is
a couple of years ago, I was
the face of shingles on WebMD.
Girls, perfect timing to ask
me to do this photo shoot.
The FBI just gave me my
camera back last week.
Oh, so you get your camera back,
but I'm still waiting
on that kilo of coke
that I spent hours carefully
filling my butt with?
Let me just change the settings.
This camera is used to taking
pictures from 800 feet away.
And we want those pictures back, Oleg!
Hey, everybody!
Just call me "rush hour traffic"
'cause I sure am horny.
Oh, Caroline, I do not know
how you go years, and years,
and years, and years,
and years, and years
without doing the nasty.
It's only been years and years.
- Come on.
- And years.
Well, I could go for a brisket sandwich.
We're closed, Sophie.
I know. I got one in my purse.
And why are you doing the photo
shoot in this skanky dishroom?
Because we're going with the
"hot dishwasher" angle.
The agency said every
model needs a hook.
Yeah, like how Cindy
Crawford has a beauty mark
and Anna Nicole Smith is dead.
Yeah, yeah. My sister is a model
in Poland and she has a hook.
It's her left hand, yeah.
It's is also great for kabobs.
Come on, Nash!
Put a little Irish Spring in your step.
I'm a little nervous.
The only other time I had my
picture taken was at school.
The priest said he needed a
shirtless one for the roll call.
Where did he go to school, Our
Lady of
Wow. You sure look hot.
Careful, Sophie.
That's my brisket.
I'm not talking about
Daniel Day-Loser here.
I'm talking about Oleg.
You are sweating like an old knockwurst
that has been left out in the sun.
It's really breathtaking.
Okay, Nash, stand over
here near the hose
and give me hot face, dead eyes.
You know, like me when I
mix NyQuil and DayQuil.
I call it AfternoonQuil.
Okay. Now I'm gonna start shooting.
Yeah. Shoot, baby! Shoot!
- What do you think?
-
Well, he's stiff, but
not in the good way.
Ugh, this is painful.
He's like Susan Boyle
without the star quality.
We need a little of what
he had the other day.
You'll thank me for this later.
Yes, Nash, yes!
Tear your shirt!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Stop!
What the hell is happening in here?
I didn't give anyone
permission to use my diner
for a photo shoot.
Calm down.
We are trying to get him a modeling job.
He has a job! He's my number one worker.
Like the doctor said to your
mother when you were born,
tough break.
You two crows don't
let me have anything!
Okay, Nash, part of the model audish
is to see how you'd be as a
performer in commercials,
and movies, and other things
people don't watch anymore.
Now, obviously, right out of the gate,
you're not gonna be as good
as that duck who says "Aflac,"
but you've got to be at least
as good as Ben Affleck.
I can help. For a time,
I had a rich acting career.
It started with a
starring role in
and ended when I portrayed Rosa Parks
in an ill-advised high school production
that led to an investigation by the NAACP.
Ooh, this is a commercial
for breakfast cereal!
Ah! Every actor's dream!
Hey, Nash, read this.
Think James Dean.
But alive and eating Cocoa Puffs.
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part
of any well-balanced breakfast."
I'm trying to find a nice way to say...
You suck, bro.
You... you get it.
You know the thrill of eating chocolate
at a traditionally
non-chocolatey time of day.
Let's tap into that.
Okay. Take it from the top.
And this time, go cuckoo.
Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious..."
Stop.
Don't phone this in.
It's not Raisin Bran.
"Pocoa Cuffs are a delicious..."
"Pocoa Cuffs"?
Pocoa Cuffs?
I just can't with these
rank amateurs, Caroline.
Max, calm down.
It's a fake tryout for
a cereal commercial,
not
I'm nervous. I'm not an actor.
Uh, no, you are not.
Give me that.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Got it.
Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part
of any well-balanced breakfast!
They're good for you,
which parents love,
and they taste like candy, which I love!
I can't help it! I'm
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!
Cuckoo!
I'm tearing up, and it's not
just the black mold in here.
Max, I think you may have just
set the acting bar too high.
-
- Oh.
I've never set a bar too high before.
I've set a bar on fire and
I've left a bar too high.
Oh, hey, girls.
Oh, do you mind if I hang down
here with you for a while?
Oleg is up there, he's
trying to seduce me
by cleaning the apartment.
And it's, oh, oh, so dirty.
Oh, oh, he's vacuuming now,
which means he's naked.
Oh, me and my Polish values.
Polish Values?
That's the name of my favorite
dollar store in Brooklyn.
Oh, he's deep-cleaning the shag.
Oh, my God. Somebody, do something
to make me not want sex.
All right, Nash, why don't you
show us your runway walk?
That was it.
Oh, I thought you were
going to pick up a pen.
Thanks, perfect.
Now I'm completely turned off.
Watching that potato walk across
the room really did the trick.
Nash, concentrate.
Follow my lead.
Bam. Pow. Bam. Pow.
And step and bam, and step and pow,
and step and bam!
Oh, even better!
I mean, after that, they
could film the sequel
to on my lady parts.
Yeah, me too.
But just 'cause I "Let
It Go" down there.
-
- Aaah!
Oh, now he's using the wand attachment.
Oh, and he's getting real
deep between the cushions.
Oh, my God, just screw it.
I'm never gonna make it to the wedding!
Oh, Grandma Kuchenski, please forgive me
for what I'm about to do.
I...
Well, you were no White Lily yourself!
Wow.
He's bamming and powing up a storm.
When he's famous, I
hope he remembers us.
Pfft. I like to think I did some
things he will never forget.
How's that?
Great, you can walk.
If you can read too, I'll
treat myself to a Snapple.
Let's get to the copy.
Actually, we came prepared.
Nash rehearsed the Cocoa
Puffs commercial.
I think you'll be quite moved.
Oh yeah, well, we'll
be reading something
a little different today.
Don't panic. They do this all the time.
They want to make sure you're flexible.
Yeah. Go ahead, Nash.
Whatever cereal it is,
act like it's delicious.
Unless it's Rice Krispies. A-boring!
Okay, here goes.
"You know you like it.
Bend over, bitch."
Uh, are we missing a page?
Cereals have changed since I was a kid.
Should I read the part where I notice
the teacher's not wearing any panties?
Oh, my God. This is porn!
No wonder all those people
out there were freaks.
No wonder I recognized so many of them.
Don't act so surprised.
Everyone knows Cocoa
Puffs is code for porn.
Also, you sent us some
pictures taken by someone
very experienced in erotica.
We can't let him do this.
I have a movie that
starts shooting tomorrow
that pays $1,000 a day.
Can we?
Maybe we can't.
It's the lead in
Maybe we can.
I think we need a little
sidebar, Delores.
-
- Should I come with you?
No, we're good.
I have a couple of
questions for the actor.
Can you swim, and are you circumcised?
Max, this has gone too far.
I know, I was expecting you
to just crash with me
for a couple of days
and get your own place.
Are we really gonna
let Nash do porn
just so he doesn't work at the diner?
Hey, ladies, what's it gonna be?
I got other talent to see.
I got a guy named Lustin Beaver
taking the Amtrak in from Philly.
Max, if you're really keen
on me being a porn actor,
I'll do it.
She says, tomorrow, they start filming
And, they'll pay me more for my accent.
Also, what does "gay for pay" mean?
Ugh, I guess it means we got to go.
Look at him, Max.
A cute guy, eaten up and
spat out by show business
like so many Baldwin
brothers before him.
Nash doesn't care about modeling.
He's 21. He doesn't care about anything.
His biggest concern is
playing with the XBox.
Mine and, also, the popular
video game system.
He cares about you.
He was willing to do "gay for pay."
Did I hear Nash is going "gay for pay"?
'Cause I've got $4 burning
a hole in my pocket.
Oh, a customer.
Hi, welcome to The High.
Here for dessert?
Oh, thanks but I haven't
had cake since my Sweet 16,
and even then, I made
myself throw it up.
I'm meeting someone here
and my phone's about to die.
And if it dies, I will too.
Do you have an outlet?
Screaming in the shower
really works for me.
Like, right into the water.
Super cute. But I do
need a phone outlet.
I'll plug you in, honey,
and I'll take care of your phone, too.
Girls, meet Marie.
Hi. Seriously, down to 10%.
Oh, did you two meet on "Lez Meet Up"?
No, honey, I've never
been on "Lez Meet Up."
Oh, you're thinking of me, Caroline.
You know how much I love lady tail.
This place is amazing.
Isn't it amazing?
I had the decorator redo it nine times.
You can feel his anger in the walls.
It's electric.
We're electric. Who is this miracle?
That's Nash. I found him in the Bowery
next to a pile of burning trash.
Go say hi.
He's even creamier and
more delicious up close.
You're eating? That is so punk rock.
Tell me everything right now.
Uh, well, I'm a dishwasher.
I'm from Ireland.
Oh, I was trying to become a model
and I almost did porn an hour ago.
That is the best story I ever heard.
Tell it to me again standing up.
But this time, don't talk.
I see face, I see ass, I see model.
Do you have a manager?
I guess that'd be Caroline,
the blonde one over there.
Blonde one, come over here and
talk to me about your client.
I am in love. He's perfection.
Marie Prower, Senior VP of Marketing.
Sweet, what company?
Guess.
Um, Tommy Hilfinger.
I work for Guess, darling.
No more words. Listen.
He's amazing.
I would tweet about him right
now, but my phone is dead.
So bring him into my office on Monday.
You heard her, Caroline.
Bring him into her office tomorrow.
She's obsessed with me.
Max, I was right. He is a model.
Get me a hot wife and a hotter
woman to cheat on her with,
'cause I'm a big-time talent manager.
Congratulations, dude.
Well, I guess if this works out,
I'm gonna have to quit my job
at the diner.
Will you be mad at me?
I'll be really sad.
I'm gonna miss you a lot, you know?
Not seeing you 24/7.
But I would hate myself
if I didn't let you
follow your dreams.
Even if it means you moving
out of the apartment, too.
Now go.
Here comes that tear again.
I'm all choked up.
Max, you would have made
a great Rosa Parks.
If you had been black
Which I guess is what they insist on.
But you got him to move out!
You are good.
Yeah, well, I mean... he is cute, but...
I'm not all that coo coo
for his Cocoa Puffs.
