All Boov settlers, please report
to your assigned transport.
Excusing me.
Pardon the me, friend.
Who am I?
I am Oh.
I has been given this name
by my many, many friends.
- Good morning!
- Oh.
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.
- Hello.
- Oh.
I am very excitement
to make a new fresh start!
We are all moving to best planet ever
for to hiding.
cowering, running
and pulling a skedaddle...
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way.
Everything you need to know about them
can be found...
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Rejoice, humanspeople!
The Boov are arrived!
Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily...
so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier.
Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.
Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown.
- Wait, what? No!
- New home?
This planet may be
a bit of a fixing-it-upper...
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet.
But now, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship.
Hey, Mom.
I think Pig wants to join us.
We're from Barbados!
We don't have snow!
We can't wait for Mom, Pig.
We gotta go.
Of course you are.
We have had many enjoyable talks.
No, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move.
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight.
I will not. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time.
Since you are at your busyness,
I shall send an e-vite to you...
so you can join later
during your leisure minute.
Please do not send.
I enjoy my leisure minute.
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.
What?
It is not my fault.
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"?
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy!
Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters.
No, Autopilot!
Any place but Paris!
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs.
The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica.
Yes! Antarctica is perfect!
Take me there now!
You can never come into the out,
ever again!
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood.
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs!
If you shoot your eye lasers,
then I'll have no choice...
- You humans cannot to explode--
- We can too!
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers.
- So, can I come into the out now?
- No!
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people.
Lifeform detected. Not human.
Move along.
Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.
I can to fixing your car.
I seen you has broken it.
I didn't break it.
I'm a very good driver.
I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible...
But let me reassure you,
the signal he broadcast...
- And we're out.
- We are doomed!
Who would wanna leave this behind?
I have got to fix this.
The smarty-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness.
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it...
That's a lot of years, Toni.
Moving on!
- We could lay on the ground...
- Yes!
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email...
Shush! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email...
Now, type in the password
and cancel that message.
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password."
Unique?
Boov are not unique!
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us.
Look for my balloons!
Party!
But, Captain, it is not my job.
I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.
- Thank you.
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city.
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude.
Actually, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose. Hold still.
I'm trying to hide from the Boov.
I'm not bringing one with me.
I haves official Boov business
out of in town.
So? I let you out of the freezer.
We're even.
- What did you do to my car?
- What doos you mean?
Oops. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti-proceed controls.
Yeah, I noticed.
Stop is go.
- Go is stop.
- Wait!
Whyfor you do this?
Boovs and humans are friends!
We're not friends.
You kidnapped my mom!
- I knows how to find her.
- How?
That information is at
Boov Central Command.
- At the Great Antenna.
- What?
- Then promise.
- What?
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt.
I promise! But if you do not wish
to be capturing, it must be now!
Oui, oui, Pig!
Paris, here we come.
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom.
Okay. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris.
You just have pets for fun
and companionship.
Gratuity Tucci.
But my friends call me "Tip."
- Tip.
- I said "my friends."
But we are friends.
All humans and Boov.
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away.
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher?
- We also has the "number two."
- Okay.
- And the "number three."
- Okay!
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three.
- but you doos need to take the day off.
- That's enough!
You can't come in here.
This is the girls' room.
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password.
- No!
- Liar!
Because every time you lie,
you turn green!
Open the door, you lying,
frog-faced squishy toy!
I am speaking the English at you.
Whyfor do you not understands me?
- Freezing!
- Look out!
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive.
Not that purple. The other purple.
The other purple.
This planet was hard to find,
and I will not abandon it!
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job.
- Quit it!
- Sorry.
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there?
If probability for success
falls below 50%...
This is not even music.
This is just noise.
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon.
you could start by liking
some of our stuff.
I can tell.
But you're getting the hang of it!
Oh, no! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!
- I must cool my core!
- Wait!
- What are you doing?
- I will returning!
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge-ment...
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs.
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that!
It means try to feel
how someone else feels.
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time.
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.
But when I founded you,
you were already alone...
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.
I was finally happy here--
there, where I lived.
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in?
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.
To not belong with her
causes you being sad.
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?
Please, come on!
I need ideas!
We could type in random
numbers and letters?
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us.
because if you has something,
they takes it.
But they're not coming
to this planet, right?
When I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?
- The interrupting cow--
- Moo!
- I was to say, "The interrupting co--"
- Moo!
- I know. That's why it's funny.
- Moo!
- Let me fi--
- Moo!
- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.
- Knock it off!
- Moo!
- Don't make me get out more tape!
- Moo!
I said I am doomed.
But doos you listen? No!
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!
All we have to do
is sneak into the city...
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom...
But it still will not work
because my face is known.
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.
- Give to me, give to me!
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now.
But they have still not
figured out my password.
- How is this possible?
- Wait a minute.
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth?
- What?
- Never mind.
It will be probably okay.
Hold still.
"My name is Oh and Captain
Smek is great and
anyone who does not think
that is a poomp 1."
- It didn't work?
- Impossible!
That is--
Oh, no! Caps Lock.
Come party. Come party.
Come party. Come party.
That is simplicity.
We shall now searching on...
She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin.
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!
I can't believe it!
My mom's in Australia!
And be very careful.
It's the only one.
Yes, but before that,
you has made your mistake.
- Wait, I have not--
- Many, many, many, many!
- So, I still has to erase you.
- Why?
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again.
- But I would not.
- But you might.
- But I would not.
- But you might.
We could go round and round.
Let's do it again!
- But I would not.
- But you might.
- But I would not.
- I love this!
- But I would not!
- Bored now.
- But I would--
- Shush!
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy.
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.
She figured it out!
Run for my life!
- What?
- Trust me.
- What are you waiting for?
- I cannot touch.
Okay, math whiz, how long
till we get to Australia?
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris...
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes.
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human.
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.
That the humans were
just like the animals...
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards.
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.
So I am saying
the sorry to you...
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry.
The true is, among Boov,
I do not fit in.
so we could move
and things would be better for us.
"My name is Captain Smek.
Shush, shush, shush."
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out."
This makes no sense.
I stopped the message.
We've been hit!
We're losing Grape Escape!
Click and ticket.
We are to crash!
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car.
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.
They are metric.
We're not getting this close
and giving up.
- Come on.
- No!
Stop being such a Boov.
It's our only chance. Come on.
- Let's go.
- Wait!
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough.
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything.
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom.
you're gonna show everybody
the super-chip and be a big hero...
- Bye, Boov!
- Get lost!
Wow. You guys really are good
at running away.
It's okay, Pig.
I'll be back with Mom.
- What?
- Hurry!
I don't understand.
She's in there?
You promised to help me find her,
and you're leaving?
- You lied to me.
- No!
- We must run away now!
- No!
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple, simple things.
I am saving you!
I am being your friend.
I hate upon the Gorg!
They are always finding us!
Captain, we are achieving
new highest speeds!
What has you done?
What is that thing?
and I ran to it
and I found the chip.
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship, and you know who it is.
And look at this.
I have the Shusher.
You telled us these things,
and we all believed them.
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other.
...but not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important.
Oh is right.
We need a new captain.
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes.
No, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there?"
But you came back!
What are you doing here?
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again.
Mom, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you.
That is Gorg mothership.
It is here to destroy the planet.
- Now?
- Just open it.
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation...
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend.
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock.
Thanking you!
High hand touching.
- Hi, Mimom.
- Hi, Oh.
Parties are so much more fun
when other people show up.
My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!
I has a new start in a new home
with new friends.
You are all invited
to a party, party, party.
Just head to the Milky Way.
Turn right at the Big Dipper.
