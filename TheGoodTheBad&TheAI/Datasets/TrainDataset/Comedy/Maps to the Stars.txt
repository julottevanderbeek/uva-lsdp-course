And she is & apos; hosto?
With all the slaves cameos.
They have their special wing.
I'll call Carrie.
Not. Love her all you want but

It will make laugh.
I have to see her at a party.
It will give me names.
Good...
And Stolen Waters?
They are all at Sundance.
Everyone except me!
C & apos; was the best reading of my life.
I'm totally amazed!
I know.
The only thing that worries might be
to cast a star in a supporting role.
But everyone does!
C & apos; film is rather minor,
your mother turned
There 30 years.
It could be great.
C & apos;'s a reinvention.
C & apos;'s a film & apos; author.
Who do you think has had the & apos;
idea of ​​my mother watching
Stolen Waters if she lived?
C & apos;'s me!
J & apos;'ve given & apos; idea Damien
there 4 years.
I know.
I deserve the role and
& apos; be credited as a producer.
Worth & apos; Oscar for Supporting Actress,
& apos; is a second chance...
c & apos; Javitz is Damien.
It raises the actors!
And I & apos;'ve been great.

J & apos;'ve talked to Harvey
will talk to Damien.
But you know...
Harvey Harvey will always
and Sterl can talk...
You know that & apos; everything is done for.

You'd be great in this role.
But in case you & apos; forgot,
your mother is dead but a cult actress.
And Damien Javitz

You thought it would be the sixth sense?
The dead speak?
You want to know what the dead?

She is dead.
You can not fart higher!
We have a warrant.
Cristina knows.
And you too.
Must protect the franchise.
We & apos; played tight...
Arnold, your team was great.
Nothing in the tabloids.
An adult into rehab,
it can boost a career.
A kid, c & apos; different.

You have to understand.
We would not be here without

Damien finds me too old?
And the cast? Sarah Horowitz?
Havana, the character is simply

Do not work for the & apos; silver.
We can not all be as malignant as
you.
You'll support me, Sterl?
You'll talk to Damien?
You know I do.
He thinks Azita Wachtel.
She was nominated for an Oscar
and is Canadian.
You know the reputation of this Wachtel?
It would leave producers
piss him in the ass.
C & apos;'s good to know.
You know him well, Damien...
That's three times
I & apos; calls in vain.
Your reading was great.
There you & apos; said?
He said C & apos; "very strong".
There & apos s; really said?
Yes.
I have to have this role.
It would be awesome together.
I thought that & apos; we & apos; already.

The Swinger deviation.
The father of David Cassidy.

You know that his mother was a very cool
actress.
Clarice Taggart?
A & E made a documentary about it.
It was very cool.
She was young.
C & apos; hell is that?

I thought Garry Marshall would be there,
that & apos; was a meeting, not a hearing
.
They m & apos; gave a bad route.
J & apos; had to walk two terminals.
At & apos; arrival I stank.
And the casting director
not even calculates me.
It goes without saying to me hello.
And she told me that Garry
didn & apos; perhaps even expect it.
C & apos; Garry Marshall is not Bertolucci.
His films are even more & apos; silver.
And I know Garry well.
She told me that & apos; they will shoot me.
And I: "Sorry, but I need
makeup."
And she said:
"Well, you do it or not?"
Like this!
I & apos; take it anymore, Jacob!
I'm so tired and

You welcome mom home.
You tell her, "Mom,

"I'm invested.
" The soup is served.
"C & apos;'s my home, Mom

Havana, darling...
I do not know not if you & apos;'ve read,
but they announce that Damien chose Azita.
This & apos; is hardly a surprise, but...
I am furious with the method used.
It makes me lose face.
But C & apos;'s my problem, not yours.
I'm so sorry, darling.
Damien m & apos; called.
C & apos;'s hard to say this on your answering machine...
I did not want you & apos; may learn from another.
I think you don & apos; got nothing to regret.
I & apos;'ve always thought.
I know it & apos; was important to you.
But it must
that you put it behind you.
So, onward!

I know  c & apos; limit is,
but do you want the part?
I need to talk to Damien.
Good. But that comes & apos; happen.

You had Azita?
Yes, I went to her house.
I said you would play the role.

Going to tell him that!
But we're close.
J & apos; going t & apos; call

Azita , but

Me, though.
I don & apos; not like this approach.
J & apos; had loved your reading.
You know.
J & apos;
had reservations about the relationship with your mother.
But the film I turn

In fact, it doesn & apos; looks like any more.
What the & apos; will reproach me.
The script is amazing.
Thank you.
I want you to feel strong,
despite the circumstances.
Nothing  & apos; happens by chance.

Scary.
You say all that & apos; we will become his mother,
but then c & apos;'s a bit extreme.
She was even named...
