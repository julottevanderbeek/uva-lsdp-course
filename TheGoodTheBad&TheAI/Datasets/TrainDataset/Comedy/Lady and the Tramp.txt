It's for you, Darling.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Jim Dear!
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
- Trimmed with ribbons?
-
- Well, it has a ribbon.
-
Oh, how sweet.
- You like her, Darling?
- Oh, I love her.
What a perfectly
beautiful little lady.
Come on, Lady.
Over here.
That's a girl.
There now,
a nice little bed for you.
But, Jim Dear,
are you sure she'll be warm enough?
Why, of course, Darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a r-- Uh-oh.
Almost forgot something.
There.
Goodnight, Lady.
Now, now, don't worry, Darling.
She'll go right to sleep.
No, no, Lady.
This is where you belong, right here.
-
- Ah, look, she's lonesome.
Don't you think maybe
just for tonight?
Now, Darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,
we must be firm
from the very beginning.
-  Lady!
-
Stop that now!
Stop it!
-
-
Lady, quiet now!
Do ya hear me?
Back to bed.
Quick now.
Not one more sound.
-
- Dear?
- Aw, Jim.
- Hmm? What? What?
Oh.
-
-
Oh, all right.
But, remember,
just for tonight.
All right, Lady.
All right.
I'm up. I'm up, Lady.
Oh, no!
What's wrong, Jim?
What is it?
Can't you explain to Lady
about Sundays?
Have you noticed, Darling,
since we've had Lady...
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?
Yes, I just don't know how
we ever got along without her.
Say, she must be
about six months old.
We'd better be getting her
a licence.
Hope it fits.
My, but it does look nice.
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?
#
#
# Four steps ahead then to the left #
# And right to the place
where I marked it #
# With a bonny bonny bone
that I'll bury for me own #
# In my bonny bonny bank
in the backyard #
- Ah, that's a grand sight.
-  Jock!
Oh, Jock!
- Hello, Jock.
- Oh, oh, it's you, lassie.
Notice anything different?
- Uh, uh, you've had a bath?
- No, not that.
- You've had your nails clipped?
- Uh-uh. Guess again.
Well, I-I wouldn't
be a-knowin' then.
Why, lassie,
a bonny new collar.
- Do ya like it?
- Aye!
Mmm! It must be very expensive.
- Have ya shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.
We'd best go at once. You know how
sensitive he is "aboot" these things.
-
- He's dreaming.
Aye, dreaming of
those bonny bygone days...
when he and his grandfather were
trackin 'criminals through the swamps.
They were?
- That was before--
- Before what?
'Tis time you knew
the truth, lassie.
It shouldn't have happened to a dog,
but, well,
Trusty hasl ost his sense of smell.
-  No!
- Aye.
But we must never
let on that we know, lassie.
It would break his poor heart.
Uh, uh, which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
- Go?
- Yeah, big fella.
About, uh, six foot two.
No, uh, three.
Wore a striped suit.
No collar.
Why, Miss Lady!
You have a collar.
Mm-hmm! And a licence.
My, my, how time does fly.
Aye, it seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth
on Jim Dear's slippers,
and now, there she is
a full-grown lady.
Wearin' the greatest honour
man can bestow.
The badge of faith and respectability.
That's right, Miss Lady.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say--
Don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, ya have, laddie.
- Oh, yeah.
-
- Oh, it's Jim Dear.
-
Please excuse me.
Hello there, Lady.
Come on. Beat ya home.
Oh, you win again!
Steady now. Steady.
Well, what have we here?
Oh, big girl now, huh? All right.
Oh, ladies first.
You know, Darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.
Yes, dear. I don't imagine anything
could ever take her place in our hearts.
What a day!
Well, now to dig up
some breakfast.
Hmm? Oh!
- Cute little rascals.
-
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coo.
Now, that breakfast.
Let's see. Bernie's?
Hmm? No. Francois?
No, no, nope.
Too much starch.
Ah, Tony's!
Oh, that's it.
Haven't been there in a week.
#
# And they call it bella notte #
Well, buon giorno, Butch!
You want your breakfast, eh?
Okay, the boss, he save-a
some-a nice-a bones for you.
Breakfast a-comin 'up
from-a left field!
Ha, ha! Good catch!
- #
-
Whoa, boy. Whoa.
#
#
#
#
-
- #
#
Hey. Psst. Psst.
Ha, ha, ha. Blimey!
Look, Peg. It's the Tramp.
-Shh!
-Hiya, handsome. Come to join the party?
All right, all right. No time
for wisecracks. I've got to get ya out.
I'm tellin' ya, the pressure's
really hot. Signs all over town.
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.
- Okay, okay, get going.
- Hey, what's goin' on over there?
Scram! And be careful!
-
- What? You mangy mutt. Hey, let go!
- Let go of me!
-
Well! Snob Hill. Ha.
Hi, gals.
How's pickings?
Pretty slim, eh?
Yeah, I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.
Uh-oh. And a fence
around every tree.
I wonder what the leash
and collarset does for excitement.
Lassie! Lassie!
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am!
Miss Lady!
Ah, good mornin', lassie!
'Tis a bonny, braw,
bright day, uh, today.
Why, Miss Lady,
is somethin' wrong?
Aye, tell us, lassie!
If somebody's been mistreatin' ya--
Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.
You?
It must be.
Jim Dear and Darling are acting so--
#
#
Jim Dear and Darling?
Hush, man!
#
Now, lassie,
get on with the details.
Well, I first noticed it
the other day when Jim Dear came home.
-
- Down, Lady. Down!
Darling? Darling!
Are you all right?
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?
I just can't help worrying. After all,
in your condition, alone here all day,
walking that dog.
- "That dog"?
- "That dog"?
He's never called me
that before.
Well, now, lassie, I wouldn't worry
my wee head "aboot" that.
Remember, they're
only humans, after all.
That's right, Miss Lady. As my
grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say--
Don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.
Aye, ya have, laddie, frequently.
Oh, yeah.
But now Darling is--
Well, we've always enjoyed our afternoon
romp together. But yesterday--
- #
-
#
-
- No, Lady.
No walk today.
#
No, Lady. Not now.
-
- Lady!
-
- Drop that, Lady!
-
- Drop it, I say!
It didn't hurt really.
But Darling has never
struck me before.
Now, lassie,
do not take it too seriously.
After all,
at a time like this--
Why, yes, you see,
Miss Lady,
there comes a time in the life
of all humans when, uh--
Well, as they put it, uh,
the birds and the bees.
Or, well, uh, the stork, you know?
Uh, no?
Well, uh--
What he's tryin'
to say, lassie, is...
Darling is expecting
a wee bairn.
- "Bairn"?
- He means a baby, Miss Lady.
Oh! What's a baby?
Well, they--
They resemble humans.
But I'd say a mite smaller.
Aye, and they walk
on all fours.
And if I remember correctly,
they "beller" a lot.
Aye, and they're very expensive.
You'll not be permitted to play with it.
But they're mighty sweet.
And very, very soft.
Just a cute little bundle--
of trouble.
Yeah, they scratch,
pinch, pull ears.
Aw, but, shucks,
any dog can take that.
It's what they do to your happy home.
Move it over, will ya, friend?
Home wreckers!
That's what they are.
Look here, laddie!
Who are you to barge in?
The voice of experience, buster.
Just wait till Junior gets here.
You get the urge for a nice
comfortable scratch and--
"Put that dog out!
He'll get fleas all over the baby!"
You start barking at some strange mutt.
"Stop that racket!
You'll wake the baby!"
And then they hit you
in the room and board department.
Remember those nice,
juicy cuts of beef?
Forget 'em.
Leftover baby food.
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?
A leaky doghouse.
- Oh, dear!
- Do not listen, lassie!
No human is that cruel!
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, everybody knows
a dog's best friend is his human.
Oh, come on now, fellas. You haven't
fallen for that old line now, have ya?
Aye, and we've no need for mongrels
and their radical ideas.
- Off with ya now! Off with ya!
- Okay, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.
- Okay,Jock.
- Heather Lad o' Glencairn to you!
- Okay, okay, okay!
But remember this, Pigeon.
A human heart has only so much room
for love and affection.
When a baby moves in,
the dog moves out.
Now, let's see.
That'll be about--
Oh, well.
-
- Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell for sure
what it's going to be, is there?
I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.
All we can do is... hope.
-
-
-
- Darling?
Are you sure you want watermelon?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and some chop suey too.
Chop suey? Oh.
Oh, all right, Darling.
That's the cutest
little thing I ever saw.
- And that bonnet!
- Isn't it just too adorable?
Don't you just love showers?
Darling, I've never seen
you look more beautiful.
Isn't she absolutely radiant?
Radiant! Why, that'sjust
what I told Bill yesterday!
"Bill," I said, "Darling looks radiant,
positively radiant!
Why, in all my days,"
I said, "I've never seen
anyone as radiant as Darling."
- Jim, you look terrible!
- Absolutely horrible!
I never saw ya look worse.
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never
lost a father yet!
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy!
Uh-huh! A boy!
What's that? Eyes?
Oh, what colour are they?
Well, oh, gosh! I-I-I forgot to look!
A boy! It's a boy!
It's a-- Doctor!
- Doctor, it's a boy!
- Yes. Yes, I know.
Aha! A boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
It's a boy! It's a boy!
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are you there, Jim?
Central? Central?
We've been cut off. Hello?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
-
-
What is a baby?
I just can't understand.
It must be something wonderful.
It must be something grand,
'cause everybody's smiling...
in a kind and wistful way.
And they haven't even noticed...
that I'm around today.
#
#
What is a baby anyway?
Oh, what is a baby?
I must find out today...
what makes Jim Dear and Darling...
act... this... way.
# La, la, lu
La, la, lu #

# I'll sweep the stardust #

There now, little star sweeper.
Dream on.
Well, that should do it. We got enough
here to take us halfway to China.
Darling. Darling?
- We haven't much time.
- Jim, I just can't leave him.
- He's still so small and helpless.
- He'll be all right.
Now, come on.
If he wakes up, we'll never get away.
- But, Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.
- Nonsense.
Hey, what's the matter with Lady?
She thinks we're running out on him.
Aw, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.
- Aunt Sarah will be here.
- With you here to help her--
-
- There's the old girl now.
Coming, Aunt Sarah!
Coming!
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- Here, let me take your things.
- Now, now. No fussing.
I know my way around. On your way now.
Mustn't miss your train.
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.
Goodbye, dears.
Goodbye, goodbye.
-  Goodbye!
-  Goodbye!
Now to see that
big nephew of mine.
Coochie, coochie,
coochie, coochie!
Oh, you adorable little--
Good gracious!
What are you doing here? Go on now!
Shoo, shoo! Scat! Get out of here!
-
- There, there.
Aunt Sarah won't let
that dog frighten you any more.
- No, no, no, no, no, dear.

-
- Do you hear what I hear?
A baby cry.
Where we finding baby,

# If we look in

# Plenty milk for you
and also some for me ##
-
-
-
- What's going on down there?
Merciful heavens!
-
- My darlings! My precious pets!
Oh, oh, that wicked animal.
Attacking my poor,
innocent, little angels.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?
I want a muzzle,
a good, strong muzzle.
Yes, ma'am. Here's our latest
combination leash and muzzle.
We'll just slip it on like this.
And, no, no, no!
- Lady!
- Nice doggy! No, no. Don't wiggle.
Steady now!
Now! Now, now!
- Careful, you little--
- Watch out!
- Doggy! Careful, doggy!
- Come back!
- Come back here, lsay!
- No!
-
-
-
-
-
-
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side ofthe tracks?
I thought you'd--
What?
Oh, you poor kid.
Oh, we've gotta
get this off. Hmm?
I think I know the very place.
Come on.
Well, here we are.
- The zoo?
- Sure.
No, no.
This way. Follow me.
#
Oh!
What's the matter, Pige?
- We can't go in.
- Why not?
- Well, the sign says--
- Yeah, well, that's--
- That's the angle.
- Angle?
Look, we'll just wait
for the right--
- #
-  Uh-oh. Here we are now.
- Just lay low.
- #
- #
-
- Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.
Were you addressing me?
What's the matter?
Can'tyou read?
Why, yes, in several
other languages.
Oh! A wise guy, eh? All right now,
what's this creature doin' here?
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?
Go away.
Why, certainly not, Officer.
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next
it was the dog that was whistlin', eh?
I'm certain I don't know.
Oh, I'm a liar now, am I?
Well, you listen to me! Aha!
Resistin' an officer of the law!
You're gonna pay! Oh!
Pull a knife on me, will ya?
Tryin' to assassinate me, are ya?
-
- Carryin' concealed weapons?
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.
Hmm? We'd better go through
this place from "A" to "Z."
Apes?
No, no, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.
- They wouldn't?
- Uh-uh. Too closely related to humans.
Oh, oh! Alligators!
Now, there's an idea.
Say, Al, do you suppose you could
nip this contraption off for us?
Glad to oblige.
Oblige, oblige.
Whoa! Whoa!
-
- Hmph. If anybody ever
needed a muzzle, it's him.
- Timber!
- Hey, Pigeon, look out!
What hare-brained idiot would--
Hey, look.
A beaver!
Here's the answer to our problem.
Let me see here.
Six foot six and
seven-sixteenth inches.
Pardon me, friend.
I wonder ifyou'd do us a little--
Busy, sonny, busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.
Gotta slide this sycamore
to the... swamp.
- This will only take
a second of your time.
- Only a second?
Listen, sonny,
do you realize every second...
is wasted over that spillway?
- Yeah, but--
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.
Gotta get it movin'.
'Tain't the cuttin' takes the time.
It's the doggone haulin'!
-
- The haulin'. Exactly.
- Now, what you need is--
- Better bisect this section here.
What you need is a log puller.
I said, a log puller!
I ain't "deef, " sonny.
There's no need to--
Did you say, "log puller"?
And, by a lucky coincidence,
you see before you,
modelled by the lovely little lady,
the new, improved...
patented, handy-dandy, never-fail,
little-giant log puller!
- The busy beaver's friend.
- You don't say!
Guaranteed not to
wear, tear, rip or ravel.
Turn around, sister,
and show the customer the merchandise.
And it cuts log hauling time 66%%!
Sixty-six percent, eh?
Think of that!
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over the limb,
like this, and haul it off.
Say, you mind
if I slip it on for size?
- Help yourself, friend!
- Okay, don't mind if I do.
How do you get the
"consarned" thing off, sonny?
Glad you brought that up, friend.
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth.
- Like this?
- Correct, friend.
Now, bite hard!
- Ya see?
- It's off!
Say, that is simple.
- Well, friend,
we'll be on our way now, so--
- Uh-uh!
Not so fast now, sonny.
I'll have to make certain
it's satisfactory before
we settle on a price.
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it.
Uh, I can, huh?
I can?
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.
Well, thanks a lot!
Thanks ever so--
Say! It works swell!
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me--
Say no more.
I get the whole picture.
Aunts, cats, muzzles. Well,
that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.
- Haven't you a family?
- One for every day of the week.
The point is, none of them have me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It's simple. You see--
Hey!
Something tells me
it's supper-time.
Come on.
I'll show you what I mean.
Now, take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie--
That's me, Pige--
makes this his Monday home.
Monday home?
Ach,ja!
Mondays is Mama Schultz
cooking Wiener schnitzel.
Mmm-mmm! Delicious.
Now, O'Briens here
is where Little Mike--
- Sure and that's me again--
comes ofa Tuesday.
- Ofa Tuesday?
Begorra and that's when they're after
havin' that darlin' corn beef.
You see, Pige, when you're
footloose and collar-free,
you take nothing but the best.
- #
- Hey, Tony's!
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.
- # Bella notte #
- No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.
Wait here.
Just-a one-a minute.
I'm a-comin '. I'm a--
What's-a matter?
Somebody's a-makin' April Fool with--
-
- Oh, hello, Butch!
Where you been so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.
Well, what do ya know?
It's-a Butch-a.
Hey, hey, hey.Joe--
Joe, bring some bones for Butch
before he eat me up.
Okay, Tony. Okay.
Bones a-comin 'up-a.
Huh? Huh? Oh!

Hey, Joe! Look-a.
Butch, he's got a new girlfriend.
Well, son of a gun.
He's got a cocker Spanish a-girl.
Hey, she's pretty
sweet kiddo, Butch.
You take-a Tony's advice
and settle down with this-a one, eh?
- "This-a one"?
- "This-a one"? Oh!
Tony, you know-- He's-a not-a
speak-a English pretty good.
- Now, first we fix the table.
- Here's yourbones, Tony.
Okay, bones-- Bones!
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face-a.
Tonight, Butch,
he's a-get a-best in-a house!
Okay, Tony.

Aha, okay. Hey, Joe!

Now, here you are-a.
The best-a spaghetti in-a town.

Oh! Oh, dear.
- Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.
Yeah. Mmm! So it is.
I should have been home hours ago.
Why? Because ya still believe in that
"ever faithful old dog Trey" routine?
- Oh, come on, Pige. Open up your eyes.
- Open my eyes?
To what a dog's life can really be.
Show ya what I mean.
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.
Well, I see nice homes
with yards and fences--
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Lookagain, Pige.
Look, there's a great big hunk
of world down there...
with no fence around it...
where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement...
and beyond those distant hills
who knows what wonderful experiences.
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.
It's all ours.
It sounds wonderful.
But?
But who'd watch over the baby?
You win.
Come on.
I'll take ya home.
#
#
# It's a beautiful night #
- # And they call it bella-- ##
-
Not to change the subject,
but, um, ever chase chickens?
- I should say not.
- Oh, ho! Then you've never lived!
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.
That's what makes it fun.
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.
But we--
we won't hurt the chickens?
Hurt 'em? No.
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
They should have been up hours ago.
-
- Some fun, eh, kid?
Hey!
What's goin 'on in there?
- What's that?
- That's the signal
to get going. Come on!
Whee!
This is livin', eh, kid?
Is it?
Come on, Pige.
Follow me.
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige?
Pige? Pige?
Pige? Where are ya, Pige?
Pige!
Pigeon!
Oh, Pige!
-
-
-
-
Hey, hey, Dachsie, how we comin '?
Just one more chorus
and we're out.
Okay, on a downbeat.
- One, two--
-
Put her in number four, Bill,
while I check her licence number.
- Okay.
-
Allright, baby, in here.
Well, well, look youse guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.
Blimey, a regular bloomin' "debutantee."
Yeah, and pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.
Yeah.
What ya in for, sweetheart?
- Puttin' fleas on the butler?
-
All right, all right, you guys.
Lay off, will ya?
What's the matter, Peg?
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.
Can't ya see the poor kid's
scared enough already?
Pay no attention,
my little "orchechornya."
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.
Is like Gorky says in Lower Dapts:
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being...
then is happy."
Boris is a philosopher.
Besides, little "bublichki,"
wearing licence here--
That is like waving--
You should excuse the expression--
red flag in front of bull.
My licence?
But what's wrong with it?
There ain't nothin'
wrong with it, dearie.
Confidential. Is not one dog
here would not give left hind
leg for such a knick-knack.
- That's your passport
to freedom, honey. Without it--
-
Hey. Hey, hey,
youse guys, look.
Poor Nutsy is takin'
the long walk.
Where is he taking him?
Through the one-way door, sister.
You-- You mean, he's--
Oh, well, a short life
and a merry one.
Yep, that's what
the Tramp always says.
- The Tramp?
- There's a bloke what never gets caught.
He's given the slip to
every dog catcher in this burg.
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,
that Tramp always
finds some way out.
I can quite easily believe that.
But, remember, my friends,
even Tramp has his Achilles heel.
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?
Achilles heel, Pedro.
This is meaning
his, uh, weaknesses.
Oh, oh, the dames, yeah!
He has an eye for
a well-turned paw, he has.
- Let's see, there's been Lulu.
- Yeah, and Trixie.
Und Fifi.
And my sister, Rosita Chiquita
Juanita Chihuahua, I think.
- What a dog.
- Yeah! Tell us about it, Peg.
What a dog!
Peg used to be in
the Dog and Pony Follies.
# He's a tramp
But they love him #
# Breaks a new heart every day #
# He's a tramp
They adore him #
# And I only hope he'll stay that way #
- # He's a tramp #
-
- # He's a scoundrel
He's a rounder #
-
# He's a cad
He's a tramp #
# But I love him #
# Yes, even I have got it pretty bad #
- # You can never tell
when he'll show up #
-
- # He gives you plenty of trouble #
-
# I guess he's just a no-count pup #
# But I wish that he were double
He's a tramp #
- # He's a rover #
- # Boom, boom, boom, ruff #
# And there's nothin' more to say #
- # Boom, boom, boom, ruff #
- # If he's a tramp he's a good one #
# And I wish that
I could travel his way #
# Wish that I could travel his way #
# Wish that I could travel his way ##
Yeah, but he never
takes 'em serious.
Ah, but some day he is
meeting someone different,
some delicate fragile creature...
who is giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.
Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?
Mmm, could be.
But when he does--
Yeah, I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love--
The poor chump grows careless--
The Cossacks are picking him up--
And it's curtains for the Tramp.
It's the little cocker,
Bill, in number four.
Okay. Allright, baby.
They've come to take ya home.
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.
Courage, man. Courage!
But I've never even
considered matrimony.
Nor I, but no matter
which of us she accepts,
we'll always be the best of friends.
Now, remember, not a word "aboot"
her unfortunate experience.
- You don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Lassie!
- Miss Lady, ma'am.
Please, I don't
want to see anybody.
Now, now, lassie.
Do not feel that way about it.
Of course not, Miss Lady.
Why, some ofthe finest people
I ever tracked down were jailbirds.
Quiet!
You great loony!
Uh, please, lassie, uh, we've come
with a proposition for helpin' ya.
Help me?
What do you mean?
Well, now, you see, lassie,
neither of us is as young
as we used to be.
But we're still
in the prime of life.
Aye, and we both got
very comfortable homes.
That's right. Where we know you'll be
welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.
So to come directly to the point--
If you could, uh,
find it possible...
to, uh, to, uh--
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it, but--
Oh, Pigeon! Oh, Pige--
Oh! Hi, boys.
Anything new in the kennel club set?
Little something I picked up
for ya, Pige.
Hmph!
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.
If this person
is annoyin' you, Miss Lady--
We'll gladly throw
the rascal out!
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.
Very well, ma'am.
You-- You mongrel!
Aw, come on, Pige.
It wasn't my fault.
Hmph!
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest!
- When I heard
they'd taken you to the pound--
- Oh!
Don't even mention
that horrible place.
I was so embarrassed and--
and frightened.
Oh, now, now, now.
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?
Trick? Trick! That reminds me.
Who is Trixie?
- Trixie?
- And Lulu? And Fifi?
And Rosita Chiquita--
- Whatever her name is?
- Ch-Chiquita-- Oh! Oh, yes, well, I--
As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.
- M-M-My heel?
- I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.
- Yes, but-- but--
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.
And I don't care if the Cossacks
do pickyou up. Goodbye!
- And take this with you!
-
-
-
Stop that!
- Hush now! Hush!
-
Stop that racket!
What's wrong, Pige?
- A rat!
- Where?
Upstairs, in the baby's room.
- How do I get in?
- The little door on the porch.
-
-
-
-
-
Merciful heavens!
- Oh, you poor little darling.
Now, now, now, now, now.
-
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You-- You vicious brutes!
Back! Get back!
Go on! Get back!
The pound! The pound!
- That's it. I'll call the pound.
-
Come here, you.
Come here!
- Come on, come on. Come along!
I'll call them this minute.
-
Couldn't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.
-
- Hello!Hello!
I don't care if you are
alone there, young man.
I insist you pick him up immediately.
Darling, look.
And if you want my advice,
you'll destroy that animal at once.
Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.
We'll take care of him.
-  Well, what do you suppose--
- Say, what'sgoing on here?
- Just pickin' up a stray, mister.
Come on! Get up!
-
Caught him attackin' a baby.
- Good heavens!
- My baby!
- Aunt Sarah!
- Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah!
- Aunt Sarah!
- Aunt Sarah!
I was certain he was no good
the moment I first laid eyes on him.
Yeah, but, uh, I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.
Thank goodness
I got there in time.
There they were, crib overturned--
I'm sure there must be
some mistake. I know Lady wouldn't--
Watch out!
That dog's loose! Keep her away!
Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.
What is it, old girl?
-
- What are you trying--
- Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here!
- What is it,Jim?
A rat!
A rat?
We should have known.
I misjudged him... badly.
Come on.
We got to stop that wagon.
But, man, we don't know
which way they've gone.
- We'll track 'em down.
- A-A-And then?
We'll hold 'em.
Hold 'em at bay.
- Now what?
- The scent. Follow the scent.
Let's face it, man.
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.
-
- Go on! Get outta here!
Go on, you! Get away!
-
-
Go on! Get away!
Watch it now! Watch it! Watch it!
- Hi, Pige.
-
All right, everybody.
Watch the birdie.
-
- Steady now.
-
- Hold it.
-
-
I guess I used
a little too much.
Uh-oh. Darling.
- Visitors.
- Visitors?
Why, it's Jock.
And goodold Trusty.
Careful now, man.
Careful.
- It's a wee bit slippery.
- Yes, yes.
-
- All right, boy.
-  We'll let 'em in.
-
No, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.
Well, merry Christmas!
Come in! Come in!
If you'll just step into the parlour,
I'll see about refreshments.
Oh, darling,
where did you put the dog biscuits?
- You know, the box
Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
- In the kitchen,Jim Dear.
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.
- Aye.
-
But there's a bit of
their father in 'em too.
Well, and I see you
finally acquired a collar.
Oh, yes, complete with licence.
Oh, yeah, a new collar.
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.
-
- "Trusty, "I says--
"Trusty, somebody's
wearin' a new collar. "
Of course, now, my sense of smell
is very highly developed.
Runs in the family, you know?
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say--
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.
Huh? I haven't?
Well, uh, as Old Reliable
used to say--
He'd say, uh, uh--
He'd say, uh--
Uh-- Hmm?
Doggone.
You know, I clean forgot
what it was he used to say.
