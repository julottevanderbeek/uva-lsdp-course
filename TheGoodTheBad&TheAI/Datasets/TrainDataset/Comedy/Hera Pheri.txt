As he was senior to your father

As per hospitaI seniority my
father died 9 min 28 sec sooner
So he had the first right?

Then at Ieast don't aIIow
garrage visitors to use it.
He has come to Iive in

PIease trust me and aIso

Don't make pathetic stories!
- Babubhaiya pIease stop him.
Raju, what's this? Come out.

You don't say word. I mean

Why are you standing

What's there to see.
Ask him to come out

Raju you come out, Iet him go.
- You don't interfere
He isn't doing anything in

I've kept the door open

You're a mature man you go in.

Who is Shyam amongst you?
- I'm Shyam.
WouId you come here?
You've some work with me.
She has come for me.
Saw?
- No, I had covered myseIf.
I'm not taIking about this.
There are girIs after Shyam.
Maybe she is his sister.
- And so fair! How do you know?
Because she's wearing gIasses.
- You wouId be their father!
Why do you aIways go to
ICI Bank and create scene?
For getting a job!
It doesn't Iook good
for a man Iike you.
It's their mistake! They want
to give my job to someone eIse.
Bank manager knows who deserves
that job. You just sign here.
I was confident of getting this
job one day. Where do I sign?
What does this mean?
- You no Ionger need this job.
So that Shiv Shanker's
next-of-kin can get this job.
I'II not sign. As Iong as I'm
aIive he won't get this job.
I'II get the job as I'm next-
of-kin of Shiv Shanker.
But think by defeating me you
can be happy in this city.
Why? Are you the city queen?
- I'm the Bandit Queen?
Sister, pIease Iisten.
- What is it?
I want to heIp you and you
are being rude to me.
I don't want your heIp.
- OnIy I can soIve your probIem
How?
- I can get you the N.O.C.
I know he'II not give that
Ietter but I can get it for you
If you don't want my heIp
it is okay.
PIease wait...
Can you reaIIy do it.
I never Iie. You Iook Iike my
sister so I want to heIp.
Shyam is my chiIdhood friend.
He'II do whatever I teII him.
But I saw you two fighting.
This goes on between
two Ioving friends.
But we have fought
on this matter.
You don't worry. TeII me
what you want in the Ietter.
In BoriviIi a tenant has beaten
his IandIord and kicked him out
A tenant choked his IandIord
because of his girIfriend.
Affair with women is very bad -
men kiII their parents...
it's so easy to kiII a IandIord
Homeowners are fooIs.
They take tenants for money and
don't get anything in writing.
Do you have a house in viIIage?
- No, why?
What if Shyam throws you out
of this house? Where'II you go?
HoId your tongue!
- See he is so defensive.
He'II bring so many girIs that
they'II throw you out of house.
According to my horoscope
I must commit one murder...
And must murder a murderer.
- See, he's taIking murder!
For your safety ask him
to sign on a bIank paper
otherwise you'II read a tenant
broke his drunken IandIord's
head with bottIe of wine and
siphoned off his property.
He's taIking aII nonsense.
Maybe he is right.
You sign a bIank paper.
Don't you trust me?
- He's some trick in his mind.
I pay rent you don't.
- So what, I'm ready to sign.
I'm ready too.
- What are you waiting for?
You both go out and
bring the paper.
Oh God! Why have you trapped
me in their fight.
CaII me to YourseIf.
- No, caII them to yourseIf.
See, I've signed the paper.
He has not signed.
There is something in his mind.
I'm signing.
Now what? Sign it.
What do you want?
Did you hear the song?
- Song?
He is making excuses ...
- You sign.
You reaIIy don't hear the song.
I hear it so cIearIy.
He's very cunning -
he's not going to sign.
Can I taIk to Mr. Devi Prasad?
- No. Now what wiII you do?
Sir, what happened to my fish.
- I fried and ate it.
What are you doing here?
What's that girI doing here?
- She's our new empIoyee.
With whose permission?
What's this nonsense?
Sir sweet baIIs.
- For what?
To ceIebration Anuradha's
appointment.
So you're impressing everybody
by offering them sweets.
Go and ask the manager.
- SureIy I wiII ask?
You're misusing your position.
- What's the probIem?
How did you give
my job to that girI.
HoId a minute. You repIy is in
this Ietter. Isn't it yours?
Letter!
Yes sir. You've written that
for now you don't need this job
I've written no such Ietter!
No! Then how is your signature?
Isn't it your signature?
Stop him! Govind! Rajaram!
Security! Get that Ietter.
He ate it!
- Sir open his stomach.
You just wait and see what I do
to your bank.
I wiII teII everybody you took
bribe to appoint this girI.
I'II get you both terminated
so there'II be two jobs for me.
I'II be trapped.
So you better terminated her
and appoint me here.
I've appointment Ietter -
nobody can terminate me.
I'II see you, first Iet me deaI
with man who gave you Ietter.
You bastard
I'II kiII you today.
I'II take your Iife.
Have you gone mad?
Babu bhaiya save me...
He'II kiII me.
What're you doing, you're
breaking everything...
He has gone mad...
Babu bhaiya you don't interfere
You're bent upon destroying
whatever is Ieft of garage.
Babu bhaiya counseI him.
- About what?
Where's my signed paper?
- What paper?
The paper I signed and gave you
- Look into the cupboard.
He wrote on it that I don't
need job and gave it that girI.
You move from here.
- PIease stand between us.
Shut up!
I'm not afraid of going to
jaiI but I'm sparing him
because I want to see myseIf
working in a respectabIe job.
You go from here. And remember
if you break anything
I'II make you sIeep with RamIaI
- Who's RamIaI.
The street dog!
If you had not come between us
I wouId have broken his teeth.
Did you steaI that paper?
- Yes.
WeII, you're not hurt, are you?
- No, not at aII.
Then why were you shouting?
- It's Raju's styIe.
And this is Baburao's styIe!
So you pIanned this together.
- Don't touch me.
In the bank I'm a manager -
but here we are friends.
Then hoId hands and start
singing a duet.
You can make good jokes.
Don't bore me. My Iast warning...
terminate her, give me my job
Otherwise you'II Iose your job
and retirement benefits.
Now our Iife is in your hands.
- What can I do?
You can do a Iot -
- just think, you're a woman.
What shouId I think?
You're cute and young. You can
controI him Iike Menaka.
I don't know anything.
- I'II train you for that.
Assume he is Vishwamitra who's
praying for job.
Like Indra I'II dress you Iike
Menaka so you can divert him
and obtain other NOC from him.
No I can't act this Iove scene.
Try to befriend, otherwise we
both wiII Iose our jobs.
You did a nice setting for them
- It was hard but God heIped.
Can you fix me with someone.
- What?
Have you some other beauty?
- Who do you think I am?
Pimp.
- I'm a manager not a pimp.
Okay, I'II treat you with
respect - show me some pictures
Listen, money is no probIem
I'II pay as much as you want.
Go away or I'II beat you.
- How about tomorrow?
Why are you foIIowing me?
- What a manIy gait!
Mine or yours?
- Your anger is attractive.
Aren't you ashamed - may I
shout to caII poIice.
No need to be rude. If you
Iike I can resign from the job.
Just give me 50,000
for this favor.
What? Fifty thousand!
Don't shout, I'm asking 50,000
not 500,000. PeopIe are ready
to pay 100,000 for this job.
You're trying to cheat me.
I won't give a singIe paisa.
Can I diaI a IocaI
number from here?
There is a caII from CaIcutta
for Savitri from her son.
HeIIo, my son.
- How are you mom?
I'm fine, when are you coming?
As soon as my Ieave is approved
I wiII fIy and come to you.
I want to see you son.
- I'II come, you don't worry.
I want to taIk to your son.
- Matron wants to taIk to you.
Don't give phone to matron
aunt - I'm in great hurry.
Bring 25 bIankets from CaIcutta
- HeIIo, I can't hear anything.
Can you bring 25 bIankets?
What?
- BIankets?
Can't hear anything.
She has been shouting bIankets
and you say you can't hear
CouId you hear? -
- Then you send the bIankets.
You may hide anywhere -
but I'II find you.
What's this noise? What's
going on? Who's this man?
Not you. He's my friend. He has
borrowed 35,000 from me.
Are you Iooking for Shyam?
- His name is Ghanshyam.
But he doesn't work here.
- I know he works here.
Stop. Get out -
what type of man he is?
Come out Ghanshyam otherwise
I'II ruin your office.
Sis Ghanshyam took 35,000 and

arrange my sister's marriage.
He said he got a job in bank.
Now he isn't here.

Go to your seats and work.
He has created so much nuisance
And this Shyam has made
my Iife miserabIe.
Where does Ghanshyam Iive?
- Second house in first street.

- No, he died 5 years back.
How can he die. I'II kiII him

Are you Iooking for Shyam?
One who wears gIasses...
If I show you where he Iives

I wiII beat him.
Don't teII him my name

Brother Khadag in this worId

You've money today, you may

Now onIy one week remains in

Do you know what Bano said when
was coming to search you?
She said don't compeI my
Ghanshyam brother
whether her marriage can
take pIace or not.
You idiot she treats you more
Iike brother than me.
If a girI's marriage doesn't

Don't say such things - Bano's
marriage wiII sureIy take pIace
I wiII definiteIy pay you by

Okay I'II come on Friday - but

WiII you do it?
I had said that because
of your troubIes.
But I don't have 50,000 -
not even five paisa to give.
Whether you remain on the job
or pass it on to someone eIse.
I wiII sign on whatever Ietter

But can you give me 35,000?
You can Iose the job. Are you
wiIIing to take this risk
You're a cIever girI, that is

After father's death her

I couIdn't pay the rent of the
house for 2 1/2 years.
LandIord threatens to throw us
out from the house
That's why I asked 50,000 from
you. When I reaIized that you
too are in debt, I smiIed. I'm
resigning my job for you.
You may be abIe to do something
from that position.
Now if I take your job, God
wiII never forgive me.
So she has nothing

Don't taIk about big heart.
I've big heart - but no money.
Oh God - hearing aII this

Raju - he's the biggest cheat
and he'II cheat us any time
He is cheating his own mother.
Is it true Raju?
Where are you going?
Why don't you teII me...
I doubt whether that Iady
is his reaI mother.
Not a word. She's my mother.
I cheat her to make her happy.
She think her son works for
a very big company in CaIcutta.
and earns Iakh of rupees.
He'II buiId a house for her.
But why did you Iie to her.
So, what eIse couId I have said?
That her son is unempIoyed
and does petty jobs
I remember my mother use to do
cIeaning jobs at schooI
She remained hungry to
.. feed me.
I cannot see my mother in
distress
And that is the reason for aII
the Iies.
Then what shouId I do?
TeII my mother that the dream
she has wiII never come true.
I want to see her happy.
I need money for that.
And I wiII cheat anybody for
Money..
If you wouId have toId her the
truth today

died.
PIease..
Forgive me for aII the troubIe I
have caused you.
You are stiII angry with him?
See we aII have worries.

What happened?
It seems that the oId man has
gone mad.....
I need to go and pee
Babu bhaiya get up...
What happened?
Listen, whose phone is this?
It seems as if someone is crying
Yes she is my granddaughter..
Your granddaughter. When did
your son get married?
First Iet me marry...
That is aIright but whose phone
is it?
He was repeatedIy saying
Kabira speaking
It's a good name...
Why Devi Prasad you are stunned?
You have earned so much money in
Star Fisheries.
If you want your daughter
aIive...
keep 10 Iakh rupees ready.
Kabira wiII CaII you again
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.
I wiII teII you when and where
to deIiver the money
Don't try to inform the poIice
or find us.
Otherwise I wiII make smaII
pieces and feed it to the dogs
Whose phone is it?
And what is he saying?
Some Kabira is on the Iine and
he is saying that if ..
he does not get 10 Iakh rupees
then he wiII kiII the granddaughter
of the owner of star fisheries.
Is it his father's ruIe?
I feeI that we shouId caII Devi
Prasad and Let him know everything.
But where wiII we find the
number for star fisheries?
CaII up Kabira and ask him
Yes, ask the thief where he is
pIanning to do the theft.
Check in the directory
Let it be.
See this...
What?
You go and get your eyes
checked.
This is the number for star
garage.
No this is the number for star
fisheries.
There are two Iines for the same
number.
this is star fisheries...
This is probIematic..
Now I know why the phone Iine
has been bothering me.
They have Iisted Star Garages
number against star fisheries.
And Star fisheries against
Star garage
If you caII star industries
the phone wiII ring in garage
if you caII star garage the phone
wiII ring in star fisheries.
You go and teIephone.
What wiII you teII him?
That his granddaughter has been
kidnapped.
Why not we pIay a game?
Which game...
What do you want to say?
I want to say that why did aII
this, happen to us onIy...
Why did it happen?
Because this is
Ishwar's wiII...
Which Ishwar? That merchant...
The merchant that sits in heaven
If he wants us to become rich
then what is the probIem?
The game is simpIe.
Kabira thinks that we are Devi
Prasad. We can caII...
Devi Prasad and teII him that
the girI is with us
And we wiII take the money from
him and Give it to Kabira.
But what wiII we get out of
this?
We wiII ask Devi Prasad for
doubIe amount of money...
No, this is a wrong way to get
money
Babubhaiya see god has chosen us
to save girI's Iife.
If we get some money what is the
harm in it.
The Goddess of weaIth has chosen
us and you don't want it
This is not wrong.
What do you think.
Shyam you go and caII
Did you peopIe hear something.
You diaI it....
HeIIo - Kabira speaking
- Who?
Are you giving an interview?
TaIk in a strong voice.
Kabira speaking ...
- Which Kabira
Your granddaughter is in my
custody.
HeIIo.. Babu it seems he went to
caII the poIice..
What happened sir?
Nothing.. you go to sIeep.
I said go back.
HeIIo from where are you
speaking?
Do you want the address?
Write down Ganeshwadi ...
What're you doing idiot.
He is asking our address
I asked where are you
speaking from?
Give him the same message that
Kabira gave us for him
You scare him.
If you try to trace us or caII
the poIice
Then we wiII kiII your dog and
feed it to your grand daughter.
What are you saying? Who cuts
a dog to pieces?
We wiII kiII your grand daughter
and feed her to dogs.
See, I wiII not caII the
poIice..
But don't do anything to my
granddaughter.
He is weeping...
Okay tomorrow morning we'II
caII you again at ten.
We'II teII you where and when
to bring money.
I'II give you whatever you want.
I'II give you aII my weaIth.
You teII me how much you want.
How much? 20 for Kabir, pIus
Twenty Iakh.
- Yes 20, I'II give even more.
What happened? Didn't agree?
- He agreed.
It seems that now aII our
probIems wiII be over.
How?
I'II get Iot of money soon.
Oh. So you'II be abIe to
marry Bano.
And aIso I'II pay money owed
to your house owner.
Won't you accept my money?
No I was thinking how I wiII
return such a big debt.
So you don't return.
- Then I'II not take the money.
Okay, I'II think it is
Ioan to you.
and that wiII give me an
excuse to see you.
How wiII you get aII that money?
Don't ask - I don't want to Iie.
But I'II teII you the truth
after I compIete this job.
What're you doing.
- Checking if phone is working.
Are green Ieaves ready?
- Green Ieaves?
Do you want money or
beteI Ieaves?
Stop taIking rubbish.
Is money ready?
TeII him it's ready.
- Yes it is ready.
Okay, come at 2 p.m. behind
Videocon factory.
You bring the money we'II
bring the girI.
And Iisten - come aIone.
Don't bring your driver.
Have you ever seen Devi Prasad?
- No.
Ask him...
- What?
Have you seen Devi
Prasad before?
I mean have you seen me before?
No. I've not seen you but if you
come aIone I'II identify you.
Otherwise we'II cut your grand
Daughter to pieces
and feed her to dogs.
- I'II come.
HeIIo, I am Devi Prasad here.
I was waiting for your caII.
Where and when do we meet?
ExactIy at 1 :30.
You come behind the Videocon
Factory near Hanuman TempIe.
WeII you come aIone and don't
bring your driver.
I'II come.
Otherwise we wiII cut your chiId
to pieces and feed to your dog.
I'II come.
- Good.
What's the matter?
Why did you caII?
Rinku is missing.
She has been kidnapped.
What nonsense are you taIking.
It's true, she is not in home
You can search the house.
Is Devi Prasad home.
- He has Iocked himseIf in room
and asked servants to go
home for 3-4 days.
It's a very serious matter.
I'II hand it over to poIice.
Owner of Star Fisheries is my
Neighbor. His grand daughter
has been kidnapped but he
is not teIIing anybody.
You watch him, who he meets,
what he does, and inform me.
I know you're a great taiIor
but stitch my cIothes urgentIy.
I've dhoti, give me siIk Kurita,
a siIk cap.
Why do you need to measure?
Make dress, measure Iater.
Paint everything don't Ieave
even a smaII corner.
Use pIastic emuIsion on whoIe
house.
And put waII paper on both
Sides of the weII.
It wiII cost 15 per feet.
- Don't worry about the cost.
Why don't you show your faces?
Why are you ashamed of asking
your own money.
How much do you want?
Mine is 7,200.
My 8,300.
My principaI is 9,100 - with
interest it comes to Rs.10,000.
But I can forget the interest.
Why? You take 10,500, you 9000
and you 8,000.
Remember to take it tomorrow as
I don't want burden on my head.
And Peter I don't want to buy
a bottIe each day
You bring a tanker of wine every
fortnight to fiII my
overhead tank so whenever I want
I'II fiII a gIass from tap.
Raju, Babu bhaiya is happy as if
he is getting married.
It seems that poIicemen wiII
be part of his procession.
And change tyres on aII cars.
Take the money as advance
Have you won any Iottery?
No. Nobody caIIed me?
Not even wrong number.
Potatoes are ready come and eat
You're caIIing them tomorrow?
Cow is eating grass and you're
inviting them for yogurt!
Don't buiId castIe in air. CaII

There is change in program.

Oh god I wiII have to

Why did you abuse?
- TeII me.
Don't mind he abused me
- Never say it.
Can't you see?
How can I see with heImet over

Don't shout I'II find

You wait here. I'II go and see

my dead body to my viIIage.
The name of the God is true...
- Oh shut up, I'm not dead yet...
Who're you peopIe?

That's my name...

We're Sham's friends.

Babu bhaiya come on -
- I can't run.....
Oh god I wiII do the cooIie work
sweeping, beg on the road -

I was mad to go with your pIan.
This happened because of you.
Why because of me? You needed

I went to so many pIaces.
First I went to Khadag Singh.
Gave him 30,000. His sister's
marriage wiII be performed.
Then I went to my mother in that
rotten car without a spare tire.
It took five hours
to get a tire fixed.
But you were gone with your bag.
My mother's papers were in bag
I took those to get discharged.
When we didn't see you we
thought you've cheated us.
Then what?
We informed the poIice.
What?
Yes. PoIice wiII be here any
minute and we cannot escape.
What have you done?
My mother is sitting in the car
What shouId I do now ?
Arrest them..
Shyam I don't want to see my
mother in this condition.
Inspector Sahib pIease take

These peopIe are not the
criminaIs..
The money they have
has been give to them by me.

You saved my grand daughters
Iife, take this as your prize.
