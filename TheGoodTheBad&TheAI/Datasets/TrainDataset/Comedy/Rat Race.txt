Hi. Checking out.
Fourteen, three, twenty-two.
- Mr. Shaffer?
- That’s me.
- I have your bill right here.
- Thank you.
- So, how was your luck last night?
- Oh, I don't... I didn't gamble.
I was just here for a friend's
bachelor party. He's the gambler.
- Excuse me, what’s these $ 110?
- Those are your in-room movies.
- No, I didn't watch any movies.
- Okay. Let’s see.
"Afro Whores".
- "Afro Whores"?
- You watched it... 11 times.
- No, no, wait...
- "Afro Whores" 2:30, 4:00 and 5:30.
Watched "The Grinch" for 10 minutes
then switched back to "Afro Whores".
I didn't watch it. It was a bachelor
party. There were 35 people there.
You can ask any of them.
You have to take that off my record.
It 's not a record, sir.
- It 's a delete.
- Okay, fine.
- How many times did you watch it?
- None. I didn't watch it.
Are you sure? "Sizzling backdoor
action with 2 sexy soul sisters."
No! I don't need to know what
it 's about! I did not watch it!
I didn't!
Miss?
Can I have another one
of these, please?
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were a woman.
I am a woman.
- You look kind of familiar.
- Yeah, you do.
I get that all the time. I guess
I just have one of those faces.
And now for our Loser Of The Week.
This week it's a no-brainer.
Templeton made the biggest bonehead
call in the history of football.
It happened last Sunday at Dallas
with the score tied at 10.
They were headed towards overtime.
They were about to toss the coin...
...to see who'd kick off.
- Dallas. Call it in the air.
- Tails.
- That's heads!
- What? That's tails, man!
- No, no, no. It's...
- That was tails.
- No, it was... hang on. It's...
- Now, what did I say?
- You said Heads.
Heads! Yeah! Heads!
Okay, little brother,
just be cool.
Just be cool.
Okay, this is it.
See the glass?
Walk across the lobby, slip on
the glass, let gravity to the rest.
I can break my neck.
It 's true. You could break your neck.
It 's a risk I'm willing to take.
Why don't you do it?
Because, Einstein, one of us
needs to be the victim and...
one of us needs to be the witness.
What kind of witness would you make?
I'm your brother. I don't know what
you're saying. How's your tongue?
How does it look?
Looks good.
It looks much better.
Okay, here we go.
We're on candid camera so...
make it look good.
Excuse me. I'm a lawyer, Gloria
Allred. What the hell happened here?
- She slipped on that glass.
- Those jerks will pay for this.
They'll pay through the nose.
I've never seen such negligence.
This is going to be huge.
- She's an angel.
- What a cute little face.
- She's absolutely beautiful.
- She has your eyes.
It 's the only picture I have. It 's
worn out, I'm always looking at it.
- You haven't seen her for 27 years?
- No, not till today.
- She called you out of the blue?
- No, I found her.
I hired a detective, I spent all my
money and now we're going to meet.
- You think she'll recognize me?
- Of course she will.
Vera Baker?
My baby.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
This is Merrill.
That 's unacceptable! Tell Warren
that if we don't ship by Tuesday...
we won't be in the stores by
Mother's Day. That 's unacceptable!
So don't give me
any excuses and do it!
Do it! Just shut up
and get it done!
Honey, you broke your phone.
It 's okay.
I carry extras.
Why don't we sit down?
You probably have
a thousand questions for me.
I was young. I didn't tell
anybody I was pregnant.
And I felt I could
handle it at the time.
Hi.
Could you just pull yourselves
together and bring us a drink?
- Sure.
- Sure, but what would you like?
- Mimosa.
- Mimosa.
They both want a Mimosa.
So...
...you sell cosmetics?
- Yeah, I have my own company.
And we're going public.
And you're not married?
- Lucianne said you wouldn't.
- Who?
She's my psychic. She's the one
who told me to come look for you.
She said you needed me.
- She did?
- She said you were lonely...
that you were worried about money,
and that you had trouble sleeping.
Who the hell isn't?
- See? We didn't need a bell man.
- Congratulations, Randy.
- You avoided another tip. Thank you.
- Those nickels and dimes add up.
- I call this bed!
- You got to pick last night!
- Go to hell, Jason!
- Hey, language, please.
Bev, his and her bathrobes!
Look at that view.
- Yeah, nice view.
- Okay, honey.
Why don't you unpack?
I'm just going to go look around.
Wait. You're not going
to the casino?
No, of course not.
You know I just drove from the
Grand Canyon. Gotta stretch my legs.
You swore on your mother's eyes.
We're here to see David Copperfield.
- No gambling.
- I'm just looking around.
In fact, I'm going to go
to the gift shop.
- I can jump farther than you!
- I'll see you guys later.
Watch!
That 's gotta hurt.
Honey, kids need you!
Hey Nick! Nicky!
- You're not leaving.
- I'm in court on Tuesday.
- No, you're not.
- I work for people who are.
You pussy. You can't leave, Nick.
It 's still going on out there.
- I have to. I got two hours sleep.
- Cunningham got another stripper.
- You've gotta see this one!
- I can't. I gotta get back.
No you don't, Nick.
I know you, man. You're scared.
You're scared it 's gonna get
out of control and someday...
...it will come back to haunt you.
- I'm not having this conversation.
You didn't even gamble. Not one
quarter. That 's no way to live.
In fact, that 's ain't even living.
It 's hiding.
I'm not hiding from anything.
Okay, then prove it. Do something.
Anything. I mean break one rule.
Like... here look, Nick.
Paper.
Come on, take it.
Take it.
Come on, Nick, take it.
I have a plane to catch, okay?
See you in Chicago.
I won! I won! Look at all
the money coming down!
Look...
"You're a winner.
See Guest Services."
A Dollar!
Come on, baby, come on!
We won!
- We won one.
- What 's this?
This isn't money.
- That 's the prize? A free buffet?
- Actually, it 's not a buffet.
It 's a special reception at 10:00
in the Penthouse Conference Room.
"Where a spectacular once in a
lifetime opportunity awaits you."
And that 's all I know.
- What do you think?
- I think it 's some kind of scam.
Oh, good, a scam! We'll do it.
- I'll need to see some ID then.
- Okay.
There. I gambled.
A family vacation, huh?
You got to savor these moments.
They'll never come around again.
- Exactly.
- Excuse me.
- Do you know what 's going on?
- Free grub, that 's what 's going on.
- This room is fabulous!
- Excuse, me.
- Does anybody know why we're here?
- Beats me.
Oh, my God!
You should sue somebody!
- I did it myself.
- What?
He said he did it himself.
He sent away for a kit.
I knew I recognized you.
You're the referee. The bonehead.
Well, that 's just the media
blowing it out of proportion.
My hairdresser's husband lost
- Everybody thinks we flip quarters.
- Can I have a picture with you?
- It 's really a commemorative coin.
- Smile!
Am I too late?
Look, I won a coin.
A gold coin.
Isn't this wonderful.
Look at this room.
What a beautiful room.
Have you seen this room?
Yes. We're in it.
I am Enrico Pollini. Now
I know what you are thinking.
- Enrico is a girl's name.
- No, I wasn't.
- No pun intended.
- What pun is that?
Look, look at all this food.
What a beautiful party.
- Little cockdoggies.
- They're called cocktail wienies.
Wienies. I'm so sorry.
My English is not so good.
But I'm learning.
- That 's it. We're out of here.
- Where are we? I just... Bye, y'all!
Excuse me! I'm Donald Sinclair.
I own this hotel.
We don't have much time. There's a
meteor the size of North Carolina...
heading straight for earth.
The impact is going to kill
everyone on this planet.
I built a bunker in the basement
that can withstand the blast.
There's room for eight people. I've
chosen the seven of you, plus me.
When this is over, it will be up
to us to repopulate the planet.
I couldn't resist!
I'm sorry!
A joke. He made a joke.
Sit down, please. Merrill, you and
your mother can sit down over here.
- How do you know she's my mother?
- Alas, there are no secrets anymore.
Actually, that 's not quite true.
There's one secret. One last secret.
It involves all of you.
I'm getting goose pimples.
Mr. Shaffer. Curiosity got the better
of you. Come and sit down.
- I'm fine, thanks.
- You haven't missed anything.
We were just cutting to the chase.
"Cutting to the chase"!
Well, you'll laugh later.
As you know, the odds against
winning a jackpot downstairs...
or hitting the state lottery are
astronomical. Millions to one.
A serious person doesn't even
bother with it. But today...
you have the chance
to play a game...
where the odds of winning
are one in six. One in six.
It 's one throw...
of the dice.
This is my attorney, Mr. Grisham.
Tragically was born...
without personality. He insists that
anyone who wishes participate...
should sign this waiver...
absolving the casino from any
responsibility or damages.
So, who do you like, Claude?
The young woman in the black coat.
She looks desperate.
But she has her mother with her.
That could slow her down.
- Perhaps.
- Now...
town called Silver City...
...New Mexico.
- Gold Rush.
Quite, right, Nick. Yes,
they struck gold there in 1860.
It was the second largest
gold rush in American history.
Very good, Nick.
I think Nick should be our captain.
In the downtown Silver City,
there's a train station.
As you go into the front door,
there's some lockers on the right.
Do you have the keys?
Six identical keys.
They all open the same locker,
that 's locker...
is a red duffel bag.
Inside the red duffel bag,
is two million dollars.
In cash. Fifties and hundreds.
Makes a pile about... so big.
First one there keeps it all.
I put transmitting devices in your
key rings to keep track of you.
That 's it.
Go!
- You can't pick people at random.
- I can do anything I like, Owen.
I'm eccentric.
- Go!
- Wait a minute, so it 's like a race?
A race. He said race.
I hope I win.
- What are the rules?
- There's only one rule.
Are you ready?
Here it is.
There are no rules.
Go!
- Go!
- When you say "go"...
you mean...
just "go!"?
Begin. Commence.
Start moving.
Theoretically, you have been racing
for about 40 seconds.
And so far,
Mr. Shaffer is winning...
because he's nearest to the door.
He's crazy!
A race! A race!
You have to pace yourself.
Carbohydrate is important.
Pasta is good.
Breathing... is important
Excuse me.
One, two, three...
It 's some sort of joke.
It has to be.
What kind of jackass just
gives away two million dollars?
Maybe it 's a publicity stunt.
What kind of publicity?
He swore us all to secrecy.
Maybe it 's a secret
publicity stunt.
A secret publicity stunt?
I don't know what it is, but there's
always an angle. People like him...
make millions of dollars everyday
playing people like us for chumps.
- I'm nobody's chump.
- So, you don't believe he is...?
Eleven-thirty, non-stop to Chicago.
I'm going to be on it.
He's right. I'm not cutting short
my first family vacation...
in three years because of some
half-assed wild goose chase.
Okay, so...
you're not going for it?
- I don't think so.
- Not me.
- So, I guess that 's that.
- Right.
It was nice meeting you. I'll take
the stairs. My room's 2 floors down.
Nice meeting you.
Have a nice vacation.
You know it 's probably stuck.
I think I'm going
to take the stairs too.
Come on, Vera!
- Hold the door, please.
- Take your time. No rush.
- Get up!
- Wait! Wait!
This is crazy. If we're all going,
why don't we go together?
You know, split
the money fifty-fifty.
- Fifty-fifty?
- You know what I mean. Whatever.
- That 's a good plan.
- It 's a race. It 's a race.
I'm winning!
I'm winning!
And they're off!
No one, gentlemen, no one...
is offering you
action like this.
A horse race with animals that
can think, and plan, and lie...
and cheat, and play dirty!
It 's the gambling experience
of a lifetime.
It 's my way of saying:
"I understand men like you.
I know what you want, I know what
you need. This casino, my casino...
is where you belong."
My cab!
- To the airport.
- You got it.
We're out the door.
I don't see you. Where are you?
- I forgot to tip the maid.
- Forget about the maid. There he is!
- Come on.
- Okay.
Bev, this is a real job.
I swear!
What is it?
The job. What 's the job?
Ink... for fountain pens.
- And they're in New Mexico?
- Silver City, New Mexico.
I love New Mexico.
Honey, we'll go with you.
- No!
- Why not?
Because we've already paid for the
room. Now who's wasting money?
No! This was your idea. I don't
care about David Copperfield.
This is our family vacation.
We'll go with you.
- But you don't understand...
- We will go with you!
Fine. Fine. Here.
Call the bellman and
have him bring the van around.
Excuse me, excuse me,
I'm in a race.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
It 's a race.
- What is he doing?
- I think he's sleeping.
- Sleeping?
- He must be narcoleptic.
- But I bet on him!
- So did I. Two million dollars.
I'm sorry gentlemen,
all the bets are locked in.
Sleeping! Sleeping!
- Look at that!
- Don't tell me how to drive!
Ride it!
- Where's my video game?
- Seatbelts everyone.
Honey, what is the rush?
I don't want to be late. This is
an opportunity of a lifetime.
You're not just a travel agent,
Roger, you're an angel.
There's one charter plane available
in Las Vegas. We just bagged it.
Get rid of it.
Get rid of it!
Throw the ball!
That 's why you're not going to get
drafted! You'll play Arena Football!
- You like football?
- Sure.
Did you happen to catch
that Dallas game last week?
You can't really call it a game.
It was a crime against football!
I lost twenty grand on that game,
and they would've won!
Now I've got to work two
shifts because of that idiot.
Stevie Wonder could have done
a better job calling that game.
Where the hell is the airport?
One flip of the coin and everything
goes down the crapper. $ 10,50.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks a lot! Have a nice flight!
You know who that was?
That was the ref. The guy
from the game. The coin-toss.
Oh, my God! You're right!
That was him!
I had him in the cab
and I let him go!
- Wait for me?
- Go, go, go.
Chumps.
Excuse me. Hi.
- I'm not a creep or anything.
- I don't have any quarters.
I never do this, but I'm reading
the same book you are. Look.
See? Lindbergh.
It 's fantastic, isn't it?
What part are you on?
- He just had a sex change.
- Who did? Lindbergh?
A sex change?
- That 's funny.
- I though so.
But don't be too proud of yourself.
I'm the most gullible guy in Chicago.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I can't. I'm flying.
- So it will relax you.
- I mean I'm flying. I'm a pilot.
Pilot? Are there
a lot of female pilots?
There's at least one.
As soon as I walk away, I'll think
of something great to say to that.
Good. Mail it to me.
Flight 115 to Albuquerque.
Gate seventeen. You better hurry.
Near the front of the plane.
Come on!
This is so exciting.
I've never been on a private plane
before. It 's bigger than my condo.
- Gentlemen, what 's our E.T.A.?
- One hour and ten minutes.
If you can do it in less than
an hour, I'll buy you both dinner.
You're on.
- Watch it! Excuse me.
- Move, move!
- Who was next?
- I was.
- I was!
- I was!
What?
You were not next!
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I am. We're in line for 20 minutes.
Hold on.
Is that the correct time?
Yes, it is.
- Who's next?
- They are.
Two tickets to Albuquerque.
Sorry.
We're completely booked.
There's nothing. There's a 4:30,
but you have to switch in Dallas.
I have had it.
What do you mean that 's it? I'm not
giving up. And neither are you.
And neither am I!
I'll tell you something, brother:
If we're not flying out of here,
no one is flying out of here.
That can't be good.
Duane!
Blaine! Blaine!
Shit! Shit!
Blaine!
Shit!
- Stop the car!
- Help!
- Duane! Stop! Stop!
- I can't!
Duane, what are you doing?
- What are you doing? Stop the car!
- Move!
Duane, stop the car!
Stop the car!
Blaine!
Freeze everything. Every flight.
Get me Central Operation.
Attention all passengers. Due to a
technical problem with our radar...
all flights are postponed
until further notice.
We apologize
for any inconvenience.
Come on, we gotta go.
- Hurry up! Let 's go!
- Wait! Dad!
Forget the bags!
Let 's go!
Out of the way!
- This is your license?
- Yes, it is.
- Where was it issued?
- In Guam.
Just head East!
And I'm in a hurry!
Hello again.
East it is.
- We have a mid-size Caprice.
- What color is it?
We don't care. Just give us any car
that 's parked closest to the door.
Ask about insurance.
- Would you like liability insurance?
- How much is it?
It doesn't matter!
We'll take it. Just hurry.
Hit "enter".
Now "shift".
"Shift" key.
Hey, watch it!
Out, idiot!
Okay, I've got one.
- What?
- A great comeback.
"Are there a lot of female pilots?"
You said: "There's at least one."
I should of said:
"Two, if you count Lindbergh."
Cause you said
he had a sex change.
It 's a work in progress.
- I'm Nick Schaffler.
- Tracy Faucet.
- You can have that drink now.
- I told you I'm flying.
- To Roswell in 5 minutes.
- Everybody's grounded.
That 's only for fixed wings. I'm in
a chopper. It 's different system.
Roswell, New Mexico?
You're flying to New Mexico?
We've been flying down all week.
They're repainting the whole fleet.
You can fly.
Nobody else can fly.
But you can fly.
And you're flying
to New Mexico.
And nobody else can fly.
Do you need a ride?
- Coconut.
- Coconut. Who had coconut?
I did.
Phil.
- That 's the kind of car I'm getting.
- Yeah? Don't count on it.
- Why not?
- The Beetle was used by the Nazis.
- I'd not be comfortable driving one.
- So, don't drive it. I will.
- Dad, I have to go.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I really do.
- We just stopped.
I couldn't go.
The bathroom was too gross.
- Can't you hold it in?
- I can't. It 's an emergency.
- Honey, there's a restaurant.
- That 's 3 miles off the road.
- We lose ten minutes.
- So what? Your daughter has to go.
- Please stop, Dad!
- Jason, look for an empty jar.
- A jar? Girls don't pee in jars.
- All right, sorry.
Jason, we're going to need
a jar and a funnel.
- I don't have to pee! It 's number 2!
- Sorry, I can't stop.
- Dad, I'm prairie dogging it.
- What the hell does that mean?
Like when a prairie dog sticks
its head in and out of the ground.
I do not wanna picture that.
Yes, sir.
Silver City it is, buddy.
It 's about 700 miles.
You don't mind, do you?
Oh, no. I don't mind.
A job's just another job for me.
- About how much that 's gonna cost?
- I wouldn't worry about it.
Tell you what. You just pay me
whatever you think is fair.
Cause...
I trust your judgment.
- I hate you! I hate you!
- All right, nobody look.
I'm going to turn on the radio,
honey, so you nobody can hear you.
I'll never forgive you.
I hate you!
Nobody can hear you, honey.
Push away!
I'll drop you off right there. In
the parking lot near the hospital.
Great. Great.
- So what 's wrong with her?
- Who?
Your sister.
You said it was serious.
- Shark bite.
- A shark bite?
- They took her to Silver City?
- There's a shark attack unit there.
How fast was I going?
- Where are we?
- It 's a shortcut I know.
- We should stick to the highway.
- There's a thought.
You say we should take highway.
I say we should take my shortcut.
Why don't we just flip a coin?
- It 's not what you think!
- Come here, blind son-of-a-bitch!
- Where's that whistle?
- Wait!
- I'm gonna cram it up your ass!
- Wait! Come back here!
Arrivederci!
I'll kill him!
- Squirrels?
- No. Thank you.
- We're looking for the Interstate.
- I get that a lot, it 's the detour.
Now they lost their way.
Now they can't go home.
- You sure you don't want one?
- We're sure. Thank you.
They make crackerjack pets.
I taught this one to shake hands.
He's not for sale, though. Who wants
to go home with the nice ladies?
Pick me, pick me!
Don't be afraid, I don't bite.
- What 's your name, pretty lady?
- Vera.
- Ma'am, we're not interested.
- I'm not talking to you, am I?
I'm talking to Vera.
What about Buckey here?
He just loves to climb
the trees, eat the nuts...
We do not want a squirrel! Now, do
you know where the Interstate is?
Of course I do, I'm not retarded.
Tell them about the short cut.
Thank you, Buckey.
I almost forgot.
There's a dandy shortcut. To
exit 14. It'll save you 30 miles.
Listen carefully. You go straight
down here, exactly 1.8 miles.
- 1.8 miles.
- Make a left at Totem Pole Ranch.
Go 5.4 miles and
you're gonna go up a big hill...
and you'll see a big yellow sign
with graffiti on it.
There's a dirt road, turn right,
it will take you to the interstate.
- Thank you very much.
- Wait a minute.
Take some nuts with you...
Just in case you see a squirrel.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Bye. You could've bought me.
Dammit, dammit.
Where am I?
A Barbie Museum!
Can we stop?
Sorry, Kimmy, we have a plan.
And we're gonna stick to the plan.
Please, Daddy.
Please, please.
It 's not fair. We never get to
stop at anywhere I want to.
I'm sure Jason doesn't want
to go the Barbie Museum.
Are you kidding? I'll stop anywhere.
I'm wigging out back here.
C'mon, you really need to pull over
and stop to give the kids a break.
- Maybe on the way back.
- Stop the car.
- I can't do that.
- We all need to stop the car.
- No can do!
- You need to stop the car!
- No!
- Could you please stop that car?
- Okay, fine. But ten minutes.
- Wow, the Barbie Museum!
Klaus Barbie. Sometimes known
as "The Butcher of Lyons".
Let the Jew revisionist
talk about the death camps...
and so called
"crimes against humanity".
This museum is lovingly dedicated to
the Klaus Barbie that nobody knows.
The husband, the devoted father,
the wine connoisseur...
and three-time
ballroom dancing champion.
Hey, there is the guy.
Barbie joined the SS in 1935...
where he soon became one of the
Führer's favorite young officers.
- Can we go?
- With greater responsibilities.
Here we see him standing by
Hitler's touring car.
The very same car which can be seen
on display outside in our courtyard.
You're leaving?
We have a16:30 book burning
and then, and then we have a...
- A Christening.
...a christening.
For one of our many white
Christian non-Jewish friend.
- Family.
- Restroom.
The Hemler Hessin
Van Sturichberg...
- Thank you so much.
- I love your do.
Thank you.
It 's beautiful.
- Wow! A gift shop.
- I know. Next time, I promise.
- Let 's go. Let 's go.
- Oh, my God!
- We've been caught!
- What do we do now?
- I say we take the interstate.
- No, take highway 12.
- Is a shortcut.
- But you don't know what it is.
- It could be a dirt road.
- Maybe we should separate.
- What?
- There's two of us.
Maybe we should separate.
You're right.
You're a genius.
If we separate, and you steal a car,
we can both go our own way.
- And double our chances.
- Alright, you take this...
We only have one key.
Look! There it its.
Totem Pole Ranch. Turn left.
All right, Squirrel Lady.
I can't believe it, Dad. You just
stole Adolph Hitler's Mercedes Benz.
Hitler had it coming.
What goes around, comes around.
Dad, they're gonna be pissed.
They're always pissed, honey.
They're Nazis. It 's their job.
Honey, when we get
to Silver City...
we'll call them.
We'll work something out.
- North?
- A detour. It'll just take a minute.
I just wanted to say "hi"
to my boyfriend.
I can't believe it.
That son-of-a-bitch!
That 's Charlene's car!
- Charlene?
- His ex-girlfriend, or so I thought.
I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation.
She probably came by just to pick up
some clothes or something.
Nice and warm, huh?
Did I come at a bad time,
asshole?
I'm gonna ram this helicopter
right down your throat!
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry! My father's a pilot!
- I've been flying since I was 15!
- I'm worried about me!
Shawn, do you have a minute? I want
to talk about our relationship!
Suck on that, creep!
No!
Not the truck!
The hood! Oh, my God!
Come on, help me. Open it.
- Tracy, I'm not comfortable with...
- Open it!
She's going to kill me.
- We should get out of here.
- Not yet.
You two-timing,
back-stabbing snake!
You worm! You turd!
My God!
What was I thinking?
I'm getting the tattoo removed!
There you go, baby!
Wait for me!
- I think we just killed him.
- You can't. He's like a cockroach.
Fix the...
Should we be this low?
Come on, let 's keep going!
Come on!
We just violated
about 115 federal laws.
- We?
- I'm going. Are you coming?
I don't think I'm...
Nice meeting you.
Get out of the truck, Shawn!
That 's it, Tracy!
You and I are through!
Tracy! Wait!
- The first illegal thing I've done.
- How does it feel?
I'm shaking. But that could be
from the helicopter crash.
- Get out of my truck, Tracy!
- It 's my truck! I paid for it!
- And who is this?
- I'm nobody.
- Yeah, you are nobody.
- Yeah, nobody.
You stay away from her,
unless you're tired of living.
While you're here, do me a favor.
Charlene left a bra in the truck!
Can you make sure she gets it?
Thanks, honey.
- So where's the driver?
- He's in the powder room.
We're never going to get
to Santa Fe by three o'clock.
- This is ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.
- I really wish he'd hurry.
- It just seems very unprofessional.
You got to help me, my wife's
out back. She's having a baby!
- She's having a what?
- A baby!
- A baby?
- It 's half out! I can see the head!
- I need your jacket.
- Why?
For her amniotic sack!
Her amniotic fluid,
it 's all gushing out!
- Gushing?
- The jacket! The jacket!
Give me the jacket!
And your pants.
- My pants?
- Yeah, for her "Placentia"...
her labia...
cervical, and...
mucus. It 's gushing!
And it 's just a hole, and...
The pants!
- And the hat.
- My hat? Why my hat?
For her...
vagina!
- Let 's go, ladies. All aboard.
- What happened to Marty?
Family emergency.
His wife's having a baby.
- A baby?
- I'm Owen. I'm your new driver.
Quiet! Quiet everybody!
Simmer down!
We're going to be on our way
in just a minute. This is Owen.
He's our new driver.
Everyone say "hello".
Hello, Owen!
Our next stop is our third annual
"I Love Lucy" convention...
in Santa Fe, New Mexico!
- What 'd you say?
- Babaloo!
- Is he dead?
- Hey, mister, are you dead?
It 's a race! It 's a race!
Run. Run.
Like crystal lightning!
Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi!
Not good. Not good.
Don't move! Stay there! I saw the
whole thing! I'll be right down!
Shit, Gloria Allred!
Hey, buddy, are you okay?
You okay?
You're back! You look great. You
don't want to report this, do you?
- Taxi!
- You don't need a taxi! Come on.
- Where are you going?
- Silver City, New Mexico.
- I am in a race.
- Silver City? It 's your lucky day!
I'm going to El Paso.
It 's right on the way. Come on.
I've got to be there by 7 tonight,
I'm going to be driving very fast.
Great.
Just want one copy? 'Cause
I got an extra one for half price.
Just one. And hurry.
That 's the best idea you ever had.
We split up, we take two keys...
...we double our chances of winning.
- It can't fail.
- You remember where we're going?
- Silver City, New Mexico.
- Right. Train station locker, 001.
- 001.
Rule number one, Discretion.
Don't talk to anybody.
- I won't. I promise.
- I'm serious. It 's 2 million dollars.
In cash.
People would just kill us
to get their hands on that key.
I love you.
- Little brother, you steal a car.
- I'm gonna steal that Corvette.
I don't care. I'll meet you in
Silver City. Don't forget your key.
That motherfucking asshole!
I'm gonna kill him!
There he is!
Go! Go!
Okay, we're at 2.4 miles.
- There's the yellow sign, turn right.
- I see it.
- You see it?
- I see it.
I just love this.
This is like a treasure hunt!
Slow down!
I can't!
I guess my favorite episode, if I
have to pick one, is number 34.
Ladies! Lucy, Lucy,
stay behind the line, please!
You remember that one when Ricky
thought he was going bald?
I don't remember that one.
It sounds like a masterpiece.
How about the one she
gets stuck in the fridge?
Ma'am! Lucy!
You have to put that out, please!
Lucy, your hair!
Thank you. I can't decide whether
to keep it up or try something new.
It 's on fire!
- Stop the bus!
- We're not stopping! Put it out!
- Put it out! We're not stopping!
- Stop!
The bathroom!
