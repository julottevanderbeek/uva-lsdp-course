Domination, domination.
Y'allready forthis
Great.
Thanks for coming. Don't speak.
You. You have weak ankles.
One ofyour calvesis bigger than the other.
Too much makeup.
Not enough makeup. What's with the skin?
Say it with me: "Sunlight"!
Male cheerleaders. Enough said.
Smile.
- Don't smile. - Chicken.
Good general toneand musculature.
Report those complimentsit gets so big...
it forms its own web site.
And you, I take youto be the captain,
which meansmore work than anyone.
Look, you don't... Shh!
No, no, no. Don't speak. Don't think.
Listen and learn.
I'm a choreographer.
That's what I do.
You... are cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders are dancerswho have gone retarded.
Whatyou do is a tiny, pathetic subset ofdancing.
I will attempt to transformyour robotic routines into poetry...
written with the human body.
Follow me or perish, sweater monkeys.
I wantyou to thinkofwhatyou ate today.
Got it? Now cut that in half.
This is called a diet. Everyone start one today.
Darcy, honey, you should stop eating.
You see, when youfeeds off its fat stores.
And ifyou skip enough, will eat your ass.
Why does everyonehave togo on a diet?
Because in cheerleading, we throw people in the air,
and fat people don't go as high.
- Come on, come on.
Ah!
I want dangerous! gonna snap theirneck!
Spirit fingers! Give mespirit fingers!
Spirit fi ngers. Give me spirit!
Ouch! I'd catch you.
Look, I understandup your ass right now,
but it beats the hellout ofa shattered skull.
Think about it.
Okay, now, Spirit fi ngers!
Andspirit fingers!
- Oh, my God! spirit fi ngers.
These are spirit fi ngers.
And these... are gold.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Screw this. for spirit fi ngers.
Come on! The spirit fi ngers are great!
Yeah, whatever.
We are so screwed.
- Hey. What's the matter? - Hey.
You don't wanna know.
Ah. Cheer crisis.
I'vejust gottenin all this... crap.
Well, if it's crap, why do you do it?
I don't know. So quit.
Maybe I should. don't like it anymore.
I didn't say that. Sounds like it.
I don't know what I want.
Irememberbackmyschoolin Detroit.
You cheeredat your other high school?
No, I never cheered, you're going through.
And regardlessand the doubts...
and the crap,
you just have to knowthat you can do it.
And if it helps,

I'm standing herereturning champions,
the Rancho Carne Toros.
Leading the squad this yearis senior Torrance Shipman.
Torrance, one ofthe thingswe've come to expect...
from the Toros overa highly originalroutine.
Can we expectWell,
I think everyonethe same way,
being as preparedjust hoping for the best.
We'rejust gladto be back here...
and eager to seehave come up with.

ofSan Bernardino.
TorranceShipman? Yes.
Tad Freeman, Universal CheerA problem?
Hey.
Idon't knowHey.
the incredible sense ofdeja vuthat last routine.
It tends to make meI wouldn'tjust now.
What? Official cheer business.
Come on. It's me. Hey, Torrance!
You see, l...
That was smooth. Real smooth.
I'll see her later. All righty.
Oh, uh, by the way, Yeah.
Well, here's another.
Thanks.
Obviously your Torosthis particular routine.
Does the namemean anything to you?
Sparky Polastri? Mm-hmm.
Apparently he's been peddlingthe California coast.
Six squads total.
We're holdingofthe discretionary panel.
About what? like this before.
We really shouldNo, don't punish the squad.
It was my choiceto hire Sparky, not theirs.
Don't penalize everyonefor my bad judgment.
But since there'sno precedent for this,
there's nothingthat forbids it.
It's simply frowned upon,
and I supposeon those grounds alone.
As defending champions, a bid to Florida,
but know that we'llbe watching you.
And don't expectwith that routine.
Taking the floornow...
What areyou doing? everything lbuilt!
It's not totally herfault. lhookedup...
This season should havebeen gravy, okay?
I handpicked the squad, an idiot-proof routine.
- Platter, nationals, hello! a stolen routine?
Oh. Don't beso naive, Torrance.
Look, the truth isI was a real leader, okay?
I did what I had to doto win at nationals,
and ever since I handedmy squad into the ground!
If I made any mistakeit wasn't borrowing cheers.
It was announcing youas my successor.
Uh-uh. Not cool.
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me go. I justHey, Big Red's a bitch.
We all know that. Even she knows that.
I don't knowwhat to do here, Aaron.
Look. I know I haven'tsince I went to college.
It's beenfor both of us.
But I still care about youYou know that, right?
You do? Ofcourse.
Which is why I hateall stressed out.
It's not good foryou.
You're a great cheerleader, Tor, and you're cute as hell.
It'sjust that maybe...
Maybe...
you'rejust notcaptain material,
and there's nothingwrong with that.
Maybe you should considertake over the squad.
They'rejust like Big Red. to give up captain?
Hey, let them dealwith the politics.
You just doYou cheer.
Cheer, Tor. Okay?
I just wanna see you happy.
Bye. Mm.
Mmm.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Friend ofyours?
