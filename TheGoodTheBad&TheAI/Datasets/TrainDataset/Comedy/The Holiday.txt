IRIS: l have found almost everything
ever written about love to be true.
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."
Oh, what an extraordinary thought!
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that,
but I'm more than willing
to believe Shakespeare had.
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer power
to alter and define our lives.
lt was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."
Now that is something I know to be true.
For some, quite inexplicably, love fades.
For others, love is simply lost.
But then, of course, love can also be found,
even ifjust for the night.
And then there's another kind of love,
the cruellest kind,
the one that almost kills its victims.
lt's called unrequited love.
Of that, l am an expert.
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other,
but what about the rest of us?
What about our stories,
those of us who fall in love alone?
We are the victims of the one-sided affair.
We are the cursed of the loved ones.
We are the unloved ones,
the walking wounded,
the handicapped without the advantage
of a great parking space.
Yes, you are looking at one such individual
and l have willingly loved that man
for over three miserable years,
the absolute worst years of my life.
The worst Christmases, the worst birthdays,
New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.
These years that l've been in love
have been the darkest days of my life,
all because l've been cursed
by being in love with a man
who does not and will not love me back.
Oh, God, just the sight of  him.
Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.
All the usual symptoms.
Oh, Jasper. Don't tell me you're still...
No, no, no, no, that's over. Very over.
What's the story with you two, anyway?
You were shagging him, weren't you?
More importantly,
l was in love with him, truth be known.
Yes, yes, l remember.
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.
Which is when l stopped shagging him.
l don't think we should be talking
about this at the office party.
But l always see you two together.
He cheated on you, but you stayed friends?
l was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.
Oh, no.
-Does it look like l'm crying right now?
-No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?
Yes. Three, almost four times
and when l've reminded him of that,
he said that it must have been
as an answer to a question,
which, by the way, it absolutely was not.
You know, lris, when you catch your guy
with another woman,
you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.
You're supposed to never talk
to the prick again.
You're supposed to throw things at him,
scream, call him names,
-not do his blooming laundry.
-l don't do his laundry.
Did someone tell you l do his laundry?
No, no, all we do now is we e-mail.
Not when he's with her, of course.
Also, when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone,
sometimes for hours,
and then there's the occasional long lunch.
You know, l never realized
how pathetic you are.
Really? Oh, God. l'm so aware of it.
They always knowjust how to get us,
don't they?
He knows whenever he wants
to come crawling back into your life...
Actually, he has made
some small comments like that recently.
Well, he hasn't exactly come right out
and said it, but he's...
-lris.
-Yeah?
-Did you file your story?
-Oh, no, not yet.
Oh! Down to the wire. Sorry.
Better go.
"Groom's best friend spoke for many guests
when he said,
"'Hilary will open Edward's eyes
"'and round out his life."'
JASPER: Okay, l've got a question for you.
What's it like to be the only person
committed to their work
while the rest of us are slumming?
You mean what's it like
to be the only person
not to finish their work on time?
Hold on, don't... Don't go.
ls it fun having a brain that works that fast?
-Shut up.
-No, l mean it.
-Probably a brilliant finish, too.
-l assure you it's not.
-Hi, Simpkey.
-Hi.
Your column today was fantastic.
God, l loved that line.
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."
Great writing.
Hey, l got you something for Christmas.
That's convenient,
'cause l got you something, too.
Oh, darling,
l don't actually have my gift with me.
ln fact, l've probably mislaid it,
but l know l got you something.
l expect it's somewhere in my car.
Do you want to know what it is?
No. No, no, that's okay.
l know you're gonna look hot in it.
Well, let's hope you find it, then.
Not exactly something hot,
but Happy Christmas.
Thank you.
l didn't think we'd actually
get a chance to do this this year.
Remember, last Christmas
we exchanged gifts in March.
This is good.
We're getting better.
You stinker.
lt's a first edition.
Where did you find it?
Buried in that little place
we found in Covent Garden that time.
Why are you so great?
HUGH: Everyone,
can l have your attention, please?
Just a couple minutes. Thank you.
Hate it that we can never talk.
Hate it.
Well, first of all, a very happy Christmas
to each and every one of you.
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know,
but we are going to try and get by this week
with a smaller than normal staff.
But before some of you rush off on holiday,
l do have one
rather important announcement.
Now, this affects lris.
lris Simpkins, where are you?
-Here, sir.
-lris, l have a tip for you.
Excellent.
A wedding was privately announced
earlier today
that l don't believe any other paper
in town knows about,
and l want you to be the first
to report on this particular union,
as it is between two
of our most esteemed colleagues.
May l introduce the newly-engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott and Jasper Bloom!
Well, if l'd known this was gonna happen,
l'd have worn my good suit.
Let's celebrate!
Everyone, drink the champagne
and eat the canap√©s here
so we can save money and elope.
Amanda!
Amanda?
Look. May l just say again
that l did not sleep with her.
Right, because your receptionist needs
to work till 3:00 in the morning.
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.
Oh, come on.
Go ahead.
Look, l don't wanna... l'm not gonna...
Your receptionist, Ethan?
You know, this is why l knew
that we were smart never to get married.
This is why l told you
never to get rid of your house.
You know, somewhere inside,
l knew this about you.
Okay, first of all,
can you please calm down? All right?
Because l did not sleep with her. All right?
And secondly,
we've had problems for over a year,
and l know you don't want
to deal with that but we have.
Oh, l am well aware we've had problems
for the last year.
lf l work a little bit too much,
l never stop hearing about it,
but if you work too much, maestro,
it's for the sake of your music.
lf you work too much?
Amanda, you cut 75 trailers this year,
you put a cutting room in the house
and you sleep with your BlackBerry.
And l'm not even gonna have
a conversation with you about sex
because l can't remember
the last time we did it.
Come on, nobody has time for sex.
That's not entirely true.
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her.
Seriously, you have to get out.
Oh, God.
You know what l really think, Ethan?
l don't think you ever really loved me.
-How's that?
-Oh, please.
No, l think you love the idea of you and me,
but not so much me. Not me. Not really.
Look, l did the best l could.
ls anybody good enough for that job?
l will send you your things.
You know you do this, right?
l mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.
lt's what you do.
ETHAN: You didn't really
want to be a couple!
-You resist it in your own way!
-Shut up!
And it's hard to detect how you even do it
because nobody's quite as smart as you.
So you're hard to catch at it, but it
always surfaces, and this is what happens.
-What happens?
-Things end.
Just like you knew they would.
Amanda, you know how l feel about you.
There's nobody like you.
You just don't want to be what l need.
-Well, not what l need.
-What?
l mean, you know... You know what l mean.
You know, l would never cheat on you.
Not under any conditions.
And neither would l, okay?
l mean, look at me, l'm down here
sweating like a pig, and look at you.
l mean, you're the only woman
on the face of the earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend
and doesn't even shed a tear?
l mean, that's gotta mean something, right?
Why does it bug you so much
that l can't cry?
Oesophageal spasm.
God, it's a big one.
-No, it's okay. l'll be all right.
-l know, l know.
-l'm thinking about me.
-Ethan, look, it's over.
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.
Just tell me.
Did you sleep with her? Just say it.
What's the difference at this point, right?
l mean, why torture me? Just...
Just put me out of my misery.
-God, what are we doing here?
-Okay.
Yes, okay? l slept with her.
Are you happy? l've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.
Look, this is not a proud moment for me.
l mean, you should just know that.
Amanda!
-Did you say am l happy?
-l didn't mean that.
You know, you get me nuts sometimes.
l say things l don't mean.
ln the world of love, Ethan,
not that l'm such a genius at it,
but in the world of love,
cheating is simply not acceptable.
No matter what you think...
l know you have
a very high opinion of yourself.
-This isn't all me.
-Okay.
So when you're not in such a rage,
l think you'll see that, too.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe when l stop having visions
of you two together,
l will see your side.
You gotta be...
l punched him in the face.
-ls this a bad time?
-No.
-No, l'm just, l'm just flipping out a little bit.
-Oh, okay.
God. Okay, no, l'm okay.
God, how did this happen? No.
You know what? l'm all right.
Hi. What's up?
Ben needs you.
NARRATOR: Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old
until the father she never knew
left her something she never expected.
MAN: Don't scream.
-Your father left you something in his will.
-l never met my father.
Well, at least now you know
he was interesting.
NARRATOR: Deception.
-How do you happen to have two guns?
-l didn't think one would be enough.
Amazing! lt finally looks like a hit.
And that is why they pay you the big bucks.
l think we should just go back
to the original cut on the end.
-lt's so much stronger.
-l agree.
And make Christmas Day twice as big,
but try it in a red.
Like, a happy red, not, like, a Scorsese red.
Happy red.
Okay, so we're done.
-Okay.
-All right!
Hey, you know,
let's just take off for a few weeks.
-Yeah.
-What do you mean, "Yeah"?
l'm not kidding.
You always say that this is our busiest time.
l need to get out of town.
You know, l think l need
some peace and quiet,
or whatever it is people go away for.
You know what l really want to do?
l want to eat carbs
without wanting to kill myself.
You know, l want to read a book,
not just a magazine. An actual book.
For years l read these reviews,
l buy the books, but l never read them.
Did you read that article
in The New York Times last Sunday?
Severe stress
makes women age prematurely,
because stress causes the DNA
in our cells to shrink
until they can no longer replicate.
So when we're stressed, we look haggard.
This is just women, not men.
l'm sorry.
And remember when they used to say
that single women over the age of 35
were more likely to be killed
by a terrorist than to get married?
Okay, that was horrible, but now
our generation is also not getting married
and, bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives
so the stress of it all shows up
on our faces, making us look haggard
while Ethan goes on looking cute forever
and shtupping his 24-year-old receptionist!
Oh, my God!
See what l mean? l need a vacation.
Okay. Where do l want to go
by myself at Christmas?
By myself, depressed at Christmas.
All alone on vacation.
Alone, alone. Totally alone.
Oh, please, just give me one. One tear.
Okay, moving on.
"Worry-Free Vacations." Good.
Where's that?
"Kayak for one"? No, thank you.
"Vacation Rentals." l could do that.
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.
l like that idea.
Where do they speak English?
"Click on a town or city." Let's see.
Which looks exactly like the Valley.
"A fairy tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.
"Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.
"An enchanting oasis of tranquillity
in a quiet English hamlet,
"just 40 minutes from exciting London."
Yeah.
What am l doing?
Low point. Low point.
"l'm interested in renting your house."
"l'm wondering if your house is available
this Christmas
"because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."
"l know it's ridiculously late to be asking,
"but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."
"l'm very interested, but the cottage
is really only available for home exchange."
Home exchange. What is that?
"l haven't done it before
but friends of mine have."
Where are you?
Please say somewhere far away.
L.A.?
l'm lris, by the way. l'm very normal.
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.
Single.
Hate my horrible life.
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.
Hi.
l must say, your house looks idyllic.
"Just what l need." Really?
What does your place look like?
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.
Honestly?
Okay, we are on for two weeks,
starting tomorrow.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-How are you?
-Fine.
-Honey, we're sitting there.
-Oh, sorry.
Oh, yes, there it is.
-Well, hello, dear.
-Hello.
Excuse me.
There we go.
-l'm so sorry.
-No, no, it's okay. Don't worry.
-Really, dear. Oh, goodness.
-lt's okay.
Clumsy me!
STEWARDESS: There you go.
WOMAN: Oh, thanks, love, that looks good.
Could l have another glass
of Bordeaux, please?
MALE NARRATOR: Amanda Woods is proud
to present Her Life.
She had it all.
Yes! That's it!
The job. The house. The guy.
This holiday season find out
what Amanda doesn't have.
This is amazing. This is amazing.
Oh, look at that!
Madam?
-Madam!
-Yeah!
-We're here.
-Okay.
-AMANDA: This can't be it.
-No, it's just down that lane.
But the thing is l'll never be able
to turn this round at the other end.
Think you can make it from here?
No.
You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?
Right at the bridge
and then just keep going way down there.
Okay.
l'm here!
Holy shit!
Oh, my God!
Okay, that'll be interesting.
Gonna get in there. Okay!
Cute dress.
Oh, suitcase.
Okay.
Now what?
l can do this.
l can drive on the wrong side of the road.
And the wrong side of the car.
Just stay focused.
Oh, please do not hit me.
Okay, l hate this.
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
-Move out of the away!
-MAN: Watch it!
AMANDA: Sorry. Stop!
Oh, God.
l need a drink.
Someone's having a party tonight.
Oh, yeah.
MAN ON TV: They went to the shops,
didn't really see anything they liked,
came home and had
a big proper kiss and hug. The end.
NARRATOR: Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old
until the father she never knew
left her something she never expected.
-How do you happen to have two guns?
-l didn't think one would be enough.
NARRATOR: Deception.
Christmas Day.
And that's why they pay me the big bucks.
MAN ON TV: And now the weather.
Most of northern England and North Wales
will have sleet and snow in the morning
and again later in the day.
JeaIousy,
turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price l pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause l'm Mr. Brightside
Blinked. Yes!
Oh, that's intense.
Oh, no. Gate?
-Who was he with?
-Maggie! The flutes, this is the best part.
Hello... Hello.
-IRIS: Hello? Can you hear me?
-Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?
No, l'm sorry. Amanda's not here, l'm afraid.
l'm trying to figure out
how to open the gates. Oh...
-Very nice.
-lf you heard that, l'm sorry.
-Hi!
-Hi.
-l'm so sorry. l'm new at the gate thing.
-lt's okay. lt was pretty funny.
l'm Miles. l work with Ethan.
-Ethan?
-Amanda's ex.
Oh, right! Right.
Do you know when she'll be back?
l'm supposed to pick up a couple things.
Amanda's in England, actually. On holiday.
l'm staying here
for a few weeks while she's away.
-You okay?
-Yes.
-Yeah, something just blew into my eye.
-Oh, l hate that. Let me see.
Yep, you got something in your eyelash.
You want me to get it?
-Okay. Thanks.
-Okay.
-Yeah, Santa Anas.
-Pardon?
The wind.
lt's what makes it so warm this time of year.
Legend has it
when the Santa Anas blow, all bets are off.
Anything can happen.
That's it.
-You okay?
-Better. Thank you.
-So, you needed to...
-Pick up Ethan's laptop.
And, and you're his...
Well, l'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but...
-Did you compose this?
-This?
-lt's beautiful.
-Yes, l did. l wrote this.
No, l didn't. l wish l did.
lt's the great Ennio Morricone.
Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
l just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.
Sure.
-l'm lris, by the way.
-Miles.
-Right.
-And this is my Maggie.
l mean, just Maggie. Not my Maggie.
-Hello.
-Hey.
-MAGGlE: Are you ready?
-Yeah. Okay.
-Don't blow away!
-l won't.
Well.
Anything can happen.
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve. 1 :00 a.m. in London.
-Who is it?
-lt's me. Hurry up. lt's freezing.
-Who are you?
-lris, open the door,
or l swear l'm gonna take a leak
all over your front porch.
Oh. You're not lris.
Or if you are,
l'm much drunker than l realized.
l'm sorry for my profanity.
l wasn't expecting you.
Well, l wasn't expecting you, either.
Nevertheless, may l just...
Oh, yeah, of course, sure,
you had to... Yeah.
-l'm Graham. lris' brother.
-Oh, brother.
Well, l'm Amanda Woods. l'm staying here.
-Amandawoods? ls that all one word?
-No.
No, it's not.
So lris is... Where is... Where is she?
She didn't tell you?
She could've done,
but as previously stated, l'm a...
l'm just, l've been on the...
-She's in Los Angeles.
-That's not possible.
-lris never goes anywhere.
-Well, we have that in common.
No, she listed this cottage
on a home exchange website and l found it.
We switched houses for two weeks
for the holiday.
She's in L.A. at my house and l'm here.
-People actually do that?
-Apparently.
Yeah. l mean, it seems.
Here l am in my pajamas.
She did ring me last night.
l didn't get a chance to get back to her.
l feel awful now.
Would you mind if l sat?
l feel like l might bump into you.
Sure. Yeah. Sit.
Oh, God.
-You okay?
-Yeah. l'm good.
Look, l'm sorry about the intrusion.
Although l may not appear it, l am, in fact,
lris' semi-respectable big brother.
But on the rare, or lately not so rare,
occasion that l frequent the local pub
and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up
so l don't get behind the wheel.
Pathetic explanation, but, unfortunately,
it's become a bit of a routine.
So how's it going so far?
l mean, up until l showed up
and ruined your night.
Well, it's not going so great.
Yeah, l'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.
-Oh. When did you get here?
-About six hours ago.
We've made a great impression on you,
haven't we?
No, it's not that. lt's just that,
you know, l'm not quite myself right now.
l came here on a stupid whim.
Honestly, l've never thought
about anything less.
lt's very unlike me.
Would you like something to drink?
Glass of water?
Tea? Wine, maybe?
l think there's a bottle of brandy.
-You fancy a glass?
-Sure.
Good.
So, l'm sorry, l've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.
Amanda.
So, Amanda, you're not married, are you?
Why? Do l look not married?
No, it was just a bacKwards way
of asking if you were married.
No, not at all.
Don't know what that means.
l mean, no, l'm not married.
Me, either.
Here you go.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
So is it horrible if l stay?
l'll be gone before you even wake up.
l promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.
-No, that's fine. Sure.
-Thank you.
Let me just get you a blanket.
ln the cupboard on top of the Scrabble.
So why is it you aren't quite yourself
at the moment?
Well, l just broke up with someone.
-Yesterday.
-Ah.
And l guess what l was feeling was that
l didn't want to be alone over the holidays,
and l thought that if l was somewhere else
that l wouldn't realize that l was alone.
But then l got here,
and l've never felt more alone in my life.
Big surprise.
-Bet you're glad you knocked on this door.
-l am, actually.
Yeah, well...
-Sorry and good night.
-Sweet dreams.
Do you think you could...
Would you mind trying that again?
Bad?
Weird.
-Kissing a total stranger.
-Really?
l do it all the time.
Let me try this.
Maybe if l closed my eyes.
You know,
given that l'm in a bit of a personal crisis
and l find myself in a total stranger's home
in a town that l can't actually
remember the name of
and considering that you showed up
and you're, like, insanely good-looking
and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway,
l'm thinking we should have sex.
lf you want.
-ls that a trick question?
-l'm actually serious.
And not that this matters, but l've never said
anything like that in my entire life before.
lt's just that this whole knowing
that l'll never see you again thing
is kind of exciting.
l mean, this is what
a vacation's supposed to be, right?
You're supposed to vacate your life,
do the unexpected,
and you are definitely unexpected.
This all sounded really wonderful
till l became the cabana boy.
You're funny, which is like a bonus.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
-Never meet me when l'm sober.
-Deal.
Oh, also l should warn you.
l'm not very good at this.
-This being?
-Sex.
Okay, now that cannot be true.
Nevertheless, the guy that l lived with
mentioned it once or twice
and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.
l mean...
l mean, how bad could l be?
l mean, sex is pretty basic, right?
-Am l pretty much talking you out of this?
-Strangely, not at all.
-How do you feel about foreplay?
-l think it's overrated.
Significantly overrated.
You are quickly becoming one
of the most interesting girls l've ever met.
Look at you.
You're already better than you think.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
l lost my contacts last night, somehow.
-Much better.
-Yeah.
-Can l help you with that?
-l should know how to do this.
You're supposed to plug them in
over here, right.
So, Amanda, l just really...
Yeah, you know, listen,
you don't have to worry about a thing here.
Okay?
-Okay.
-l mean, it was great
-meeting you, and everything.
-Definitely.
Also, for the record, your ex-boyfriend is,
in my opinion,
extremely mistaken about you.
-Well, yeah, you were drunk.
-Not all that drunk.
Yeah.
-Oh, that's mine.
-Got it.
Sophie. l'm sorry, l didn't mean to look.
l'll call her back.
Coffee cups.
-Here.
-Thank you.
-You don't want one?
-l should probably be going.
Oh, yeah, you know,
l gotta get going in a few minutes myself.
So, listen.
l know you're leaving and absolutely
not interested in getting involved,
but just so you know, things in my life
are a little bit complicated,
and even if you were staying,
l can promise you,
you wouldn't for one minute...
You really don't have to do this.
Look, l'm sort of a mess in this area myself
and anyway, l mean, honestly,
we hardly know each other.
Well, l wouldn't exactly say that,
but l just want to assure you,
-you're better off. l'm... You see...
-Okay.
No need to go on. Right.
Well, l just want to be sure you are okay,
because somehow l find
l tend to hurt women
simply by being myself. So...
l'm not going to fall in love with you,
l promise.
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.
No, it's just that l know myself.
l'm not sure l even fall in love.
Not like the way other people do.
How's that for something to admit?
Well, like l said,
Most lnteresting Girl award.
-l'm gonna try to see that as a compliment.
-You should. Absolutely.
Right.
Okay, then. Well, utter honesty.
Very refreshing. Well, you probably won't
be hearing from me
because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't,
l have the classic male problem
of no follow-through.
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date,
but since this wasn't a date,
l guess l'm off the hook.
Exactly.
But what if l wanted to call you?
Right. Sorry.
Apparently not the right thing to say at all.
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason you change your mind,
l'm having dinner with some friends
at the pub tonight
and if not, then,
well, you're lovely.
So are you.
WOMAN ON PA: Attention, passengers.
This is the final boarding call
for British Airways flight 422 to Amsterdam.
NARRATOR: Amanda wasn't looking for love,
but that doesn't mean it didn't find her.
Very well, ma'am. You're good to go.
Thank you.
Thank you, Amanda.
-Hello?
-JASPER: Where am l f inding you?
-Jasper.
-ls it okay that l'm calling you?
l suppose so. How are you?
Could we start
with a less complicated question?
-What's wrong?
-l'm having some real problems
with this section of my book.
l can use some lris.
Would it be awful if l send you some pages?
Just tell me if it is.
l don't want to mess you up, but l know that
you're the only one who can really help me.
No. Well, l mean... lf you need me.
Well, you know you are my little survival kit.
So, Simpkey,
you put on that little red bikini yet?
You know, the one that unties at the back?
How do you remember my little red bikini?
-l remember everything.
-Do you?
You know, just the other day
l was thinking about that time that we took...
Darling, l've just arrived at Soho House.
Meet some friends for drinks.
-Oh, okay.
-Here, keep the change.
Bloody cold over here.
Okay, l'm sending you the pages tomorrow.
-Look for them, will you?
-Yeah.
-And have some fun today, okay?
-Yeah.
Okay.
Graham!
-We didn't think you were coming, mate.
-Come on, man.
Oh, no, is he lost?
Excuse me. Hello.
-Can l offer you a lift home?
-Why?
-You know where l live?
-l believe l do, yes.
Good. Then that makes one of us.
-Your house is lovely.
-l've lived here 47 years.
Back then there were only six houses
on this block.
Every year they tear another one down,
not that l blame them.
They weren't that great to begin with.
But that's how l got confused.
l didn't recognize one house.
That would be confusing.
What part of England are you from?
-Surrey.
-Cary Grant was from Surrey.
-That's right, he was.
-Yeah.
-How did you know that?
-Oh, he told me once.
Well, l thank you very much, young lady.
Let me help you with that. Okay.
Yeah, l some... Oh, thank you.
There you go.
-Well, this was some meet cute.
-Sorry?
lt's how two characters meet in a movie.
Say, say, a man and a woman
both need something to sleep in
and they both go
to the same men's pyjama department.
Right.
And the man says to the salesman,
"l just need bottoms."
The woman says, "l just need a top."
They look at each other,
and that's the meet cute.
Oh, l see.
Of course, this isn't quite that cute, but...
-So you're in the film business?
-Was.
Yes, yes, l was. l was a writer.
-l could be here till tomorrow.
-Oh, here. Let me.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Well, goodbye, then.
l enjoyed our meet cute.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.
Oh, it's a pleasure. Absolutely.
You know,
l hope you don't find this strange,
but l've just arrived here
and, well, l don't really know anyone,
and l was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.
Well, if you're not busy
would you like to join me?
Busy? Honey, l haven't been busy
since 1 978.
l was his office boy for a year.
l learned everything working in his office.
-Best job l ever had.
-Wait, wait, wait.
That was your first job in Hollywood,
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?
Actually, my first job was
as a Western Union messenger.
That's how l met Mayer.
l delivered a telegram to his office at MGM.
When l walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.
Their office boy didn't show up.
l volunteered for the job.
The next day l was on the payroll.
-l was 1 7 years old.
-Wow!
-Yeah.
-So, was Hollywood really as great
-back then as l imagine?
-lt was better.
You know what l've been asking myself
all night?
What? Why l'm bothering you
with all these questions?
l'm wondering why a beautiful girl like you
would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation
and, on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cocker like me.
Well, l just wanted to get away
from the people l see all the time.
Well, not all the people.
One person.
l wanted to get away from one guy.
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.
-Sorry.
-So he's a schmuck.
As a matter of fact, he is a huge schmuck.
How did you know?
He let you go.
This is not a hard one to figure out.
lris, in the movies we have leading ladies
and we have the best friend.
You, l can tell, are a leading lady,
but for some reason
you're behaving like the best friend.
You're so right.
You're supposed to be the leading lady
of your own life, for God's sake.
Arthur, l've been going to a therapist
for three years,
and she's never explained anything
to me that well.
That was brilliant.
Brutal but brilliant. Thank you.
l haven't had that much to drink in...
Oh, what am l saying?
-l've never had that much to drink.
-Yes. l believe no one ever has.
Okay, the last thing l remember,
l was coming in here last night...
-l had nothing to do with that.
-Oh, l know, but you were here.
-l was.
-Oh, God. So l guess we...
Did we?
-We didn't?
-We did not.
Oh, thank God.
l mean, not "thank God",
but just thank God.
'Cause l didn't remember...
So why didn't we... Just remind me a little.
Call me old-fashioned, but one doesn't have
sex with women who are unconscious.
Unconscious? Oh, God.
That must have been really attractive.
Oh, why did you stay?
-Because you asked me to.
-l did, didn't l?
Did l beg at one point?
From the moment l met you,
it's been an adventure.
Oh, yes, and l am deeply sorry about that.
l have nothing to say for myself other than
l must be temporarily nuts right now.
Olivia. Sorry, l didn't mean to look. Again.
l should probably take this.
Hello. Hi.
Really? What happened?
l can't. l can't today.
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda. Busy guy.
All right, listen. l've got to go.
Whoa, bloody hell.
-l think we should go into town.
-What do you mean?
l think you should get dressed,
we should take a drive, get some lunch,
-and get to know each other.
-Really? Why?
Because l'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't. Aren't you?
-So you're a book editor.
-Yes, l am.
-What kind of an editor are you?
-A very mean one.
No. What l meant was,
do you give massive notes or...
Well, the better the writer,
the less notes l give.
-And what'd you study in school?
-Literature.
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?
Okay, my palms are starting to sweat.
l feel like l'm on a job interview.
Do you by any chance know
how to be on a date?
-Sorry, l know, l'm interrogating you.
-Yes.
l haven't been on a first date in a long time.
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice,
maybe we can bend the first-date rules.
Why are you blushing?
l didn't realize l was.
l think you make me nervous.
Okay, l'm gonna try to be myself.
lt's never easy, but l'm gonna try.
What was the question? Oh, l know.
-Did you always...
-Did l always know
-l wanted to be a book editor?
-Right.
The answer is yes, l did.
My family's in publishing.
My dad's a writer of historical fiction.
My mum's a...
Was... ls, to this day,
a very important editor at Random House.
-Okay. l believe my time is up. Your turn.
-Really?
GRAHAM: Deep breath.
-All right?
-Yeah.
Well, like l said the other night,
l own a company
that does movie advertising.
-l didn't realize you owned the company.
-That's probably 'cause l didn't mention it.
But now that l know that you were
raised by such a strong working mom,
l can say it
and maybe you won't be intimidated by it.
No, no, l'm still a little intimidated by it.
Well, "a little" is way ahead of the curve.
-Yeah.
-What about your family?
Okay, l'll say it fast.
My parents broke up when l was 1 5.
l'm an only child
and l didn't see it coming.
You know, we were really close.
We used to call ourselves
the Three Musketeers.
And one night after dinner
my parents sat me down,
and told me that they were breaking up.
l thought they were kidding. And then l saw
a suitcase out of the corner of my eye,
in the hallway.
And my dad moved out that night.
And l think
l cried myself to sleep for, like...
Well, anyway, a long time.
And then l realized that l'd better
toughen up and, well, l got through it
and, sort of, haven't cried since.
l also haven't thought
of that packed suitcase maybe ever.
-And that's my tragic little story. Let's order.
-Wait.
You haven't cried since you were 1 5?
l know it must mean something awful,
l know.
But, you know, l try, but believe me... But...
-Can we talk about you some more, please?
-Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
-Well, l cry all the time.
-You do not.
Yeah, l do.
More than any woman you've ever met.
You don't have to be this nice.
-lt happens to be the truth.
-Really?
A good book, great film, a birthday card,
l weep.
Shut up.
-l'm a major weeper.
-No, you're not.
l am.
AMANDA: This was such a great afternoon.
GRAHAM: lt was a really great afternoon.
You know, you don't have to walk me in.
lt's freezing and...
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.
No, it's not that. l just... No.
l'm just tired. l think l'm gonna take a nap.
-lt's not that.
-Okay, l'll pretend l believe you.
Oh, Graham, l'm leaving in nine days,
and that makes this complicated
and l'm not sure
l can handle complicated right now.
Okay.
-And that doesn't make things complicated?
-Sex makes everything complicated.
Even when you don't have it,
the not having it makes things complicated.
Which is why it's usually better
to have it, some say.
Well, l'm off to work in the morning.
l promise l won't be drunkenly banging
on your door any time soon.
We'll see each other. Okay?
We'll figure something out.
-Good.
-Good.
Oh, my God. lt's freezing.
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Bad timing?
-No, no. Come in.
-How's it going?
-Good. Yeah, everything's good.
This FedEx was leaning on the gate
from a little town called London, England.
A friend of mine is writing a book,
and l give him
notes sometimes.
-You have company?
-l'm having a little Hanukkah party.
What, did you join a temple
since l last saw you?
No. My neighbor knew
l didn't know anyone here
so he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends,
and somehow it turned
into a Hanukkah thing.
-Do you want to come in for a sec?
-All right. Yeah.
l can play spin the dreidel.
Smells good.
MlLES: l just have to say, this is
one of the best Hanukkahs l've ever had.
ARTHUR: Hear, hear.
l've had too much of the Manischewitz.
l'm gonna have to be cut off.
ERNlE: We're all cutting you off.
l take this very seriously,
and l'm telling you the truth.
He amazes me. This guy's amazing.
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a lady's man.
Never. l married very young.
Yes, only because he had
the greatest girl in town.
He had to marry her
to take her off the market.
That's the truth.
Everyone loved Marion.
She had the greatest laugh.
What did he say? She had the greatest ass?
Greatest laugh.
Although her ass wasn't so bad, either.
She had real gumption.
She was the girl l always wrote.
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, l presume.
No, gents, sadly l am not.
l'm just a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.
Actually, l've been dating a beautiful actress
for about five months.
l do not know what she sees in me,
but l know l'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Oh, she's an actress! What's she been in?
Anything we would have seen?
Well, she hasn't done that much yet, but...
And where is she tonight?
Look, he's half-dead
and he's still interested.
Well, l mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?
-She's on location in New Mexico.
-Okay. All right.
She's working on a little indie film.
Sorry she couldn't be here.
-She'll be back in about 1 0 days.
-Her loss is our gain.
-Thank you, Arthur.
-Fellas,
l think we should leave these young folks
and get back to our bedpans.
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.
-l got your cell. l'll be in touch.
-Okay, pound right here.
This was an amazing night.
You know, Arthur Abbott is maybe
the last of the great Hollywood writers
from that generation. Thanks.
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.
l know. He told me
that his friends wrote CasabIanca,
but that he added the "kid"
to, "Here's looking at you, kid."
Hello! Which totally makes the line.
"Here's looking at you, llsa."
lt doesn't quite have that ring.
He's so modest.
He gave me this long list of old movies
he said l had to see.
None were written by him, of course.
l saw a couple today. They were fantastic.
-Maybe we can see one together sometime.
-That would be great.
All right. Cool.
-Then l'll definitely call you.
-Goodbye.
The brisket was great and those
chocolate-covered macaroons, delectable.
lt was really fun hanging with you.
Okay, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to kiss you twice,
and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.
-No problem.
-Oh, boy.
lt is officially crazy weather.
Don't blow away!
"l'm not sure l can handle complicated"?
Oh, God, l can be such a jerk!
-NARRATOR: Amanda Woods.
-Shut up!
She pushed every guy away, every time.
lt's not, "Will she ever change?"
but, "Does she want to?"
-Surprise.
-Yeah, it is.
-Hi.
-Hi.
So l was home doing nothing
and thinking of you,
and l realized
that a little complication never hurt anyone
and then l thought
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.
And also l wanted to apologize.
l'm sorry l didn't invite you in
this afternoon.
l don't know what that was about exactly,
but whatever it was
l thought that l should just...
Oh, my God. You're...
You're not alone, are you?
-No, l'm not, actually. l'm sorry.
-No! No, no, no, don't be.
l shouldn't have just... Oh, man.
Okay, look, seriously.
Do not worry about this.
This is just me, like, being stupid.
Who is it, Daddy?
-"Daddy"?
-Yes. l am Daddy.
Amanda, this is my daughter, Sophie.
-Soph, this is my friend, Amanda.
-Hi.
How do you do?
-l'm fine, thank you. How are you?
-Very well, thank you.
-Do you want to come in?
-Oh, no, l just...
-Hi.
-Come here.
-Daddy, who is this?
-This is Amanda.
And, Amanda, this is my youngest, Olivia.
Oh.
-Sophie and Olivia.
-Dad. Dad.
-Sorry, yes. Of course. Come in.
-Come in.
Oh.
Okay.
OLlVlA: Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?
-Yes.
-With baby marshmallows?
Yes.
-Dad, take her coat.
-Yes.
-May l... May l...
-Oh, sure, thanks.
-Are you married? Tell me fast.
-No.
-Wow.
-l know, l'm a tad overdressed.
-You look like my Barbie.
-Oh. Thanks.
-ls that for us?
-Yes.
Except for l'm sorry about the wine.
Wow. What's this?
-l apologize for not mentioning this earlier.
-You're D-l-V-O-R-C-E-D?
W-l-D-O-W-E-R.
Two years ago.
Oh.
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?
As a matter of fact, l'm totally into it.
-Here we go, Olivia.
-Thank you.
Olivia, blow on it. lt's hot.
You, too, Soph.
-She has more marshmallows than me.
-No, she doesn't. You each have five.
-You have five, too.
-Thank you.
OLlVlA: One, two, three, four, five.
What? Do l have something on my lip?
Look. There.
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-Go up. Blow on mine.
Thank you. Excellent timing.
-Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.
-No.
No, no, no, we don't do Mr. Napkin Head
in company.
-Please! Do it! Do it, please!
-Would you?
-Please.
-Please. Okay, l'll do it quickly.
-Oh, thank you for that.
-You're welcome. Now do it.
All right.
-Amanda, can l borrow your napkin, please?
-Oh. Yes.
Here you go, Dad.
Yeah, you pass me those glasses
when l need them.
SOPHlE: Amanda, you're gonna love this.
lt's so funny. l mean,
you'll fall off your chair, it's so funny.
Hello.
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.
Hello, children. Who's this?
Who's this stranger?
-Amanda.
-And why has she got that funny accent?
-Amanda.
-Yes, but where is she from?
What l need is a...
-Now smoke!
-Oh, smoke.
Go on.
Smoking is really bad for you, you know.
Amanda, guess what?
We have a tent in our playroom.
-Do you want to see it?
-No, no. No.
Amanda will not crawl into your tent.
You don't like tents?
-Okay, this is seriously cool.
-Come inside.
Wow!
-Lie down.
-Okay.
-Here, Amanda. You can use my pillow.
-Thank you.
-Lie down!
-Can you please stop being so bossy?
-Lie down, please, next to me.
-Okay.
Oh, very nice.
Excuse me.
This is an exceptionally great tent.
-lt's got something, hasn't it?
-lt's cozy.
-Yeah. Who cut out all these beautiful stars?
-We did.
The Three Musketeers!
-Amanda?
-Yes?
-You smell lovely.
-Do l?
Yes. l love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.
Because you already smell so good.
-So do you, by the way.
-Thanks.
-But l'm older, so l guess l'm allowed.
-Exactly.
-l like your eye shadow.
-Thank you.
-And your lipstick.
-Thank you. lt's new.
-What's it called?
-l think it's called Berry Kiss.
Okay, Berry Kiss it is.
Berry Kiss.
-Let's see. Looks good on you.
-Amanda?
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.
We could push our beds together.
Sorry.
That's so sweet of you to invite me,
but maybe another time.
-Would that be all right?
-Yes.
Good girl.
We never have grown-ups here
that are girls.
-l know.
-l really like it.
Me, too.
l can't imagine anyone
being a bigger hit with my children.
They're really great, Graham.
Sophie's unfortunately taken on the role
as my protector.
She's brilliant, but l hate it
when she worries about me.
And Olivia's gonna be a real ball-buster
which, l must admit,
l kind of love about her.
l'm just trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.
Because l just don't usually
tell women about them.
But it... lt's just a little confusing,
because you're the one who wanted to go
out to lunch to get to know one another.
When you put it that way, it sounds awful.
l have no defense, except that
until l get to know someone really well,
it's easier for me to be a normal single guy.
Because it's way too complicated
to be who l really am.
l'm a full-time dad. l'm a working parent.
l'm a mother and a father.
l'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before l go to sleep.
l spend my weekends buying tutus.
l'm learning to sew.
l'm Mr. Napkin Head!
l'm on some kind of constant overload,
and it helps to compartmentalize my life,
just till l figure this out.
This past weekend,
the children were with their grandparents
and when they're gone,
l get to be somebody
who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilt on his jeans.
l have no idea how to date and be this
and l suppose there's the possibility
l'm afraid of what another person might do
to who we are and how we get
from one day to the next.
Yeah.
l guess since l am leaving in a week,
l sort of get you not telling me, sort of.
l thought it would be hard to introduce them
to someone l may never see again.
Right.
'Cause l'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.
Actually, l thought l was just someone
you had sex with once
-and slept with twice.
-Oh, man.
-l think we just went way past complicated.
-Right.
l'm a book editor from London.
You're a beautiful movie trailer maker
from L.A.
We're worlds apart.
l have a cow in the backyard.
-You have a cow?
-Yeah.
l sew and l have a cow.
How's that for hard to relate to?
Pretty up there.
Exactly.
-Morning, Jesus.
-Good morning.
-Santa Anas?
-Oh, yeah, long time now.
-Hi, Marta.
-Hi, lris.
Hi, there.
Hello.
-Good morning.
-l counted.
Nine movies are opening today.
l remember when nine movies
would open in a month.
Now, a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?
Arthur, have you always been this feisty?
Well, l may have slowed down a little,
but yes.
You've got to fight the fight, kid.
Okay, your mail. Gas company, phone bill
and you've got a letter
from the Writers Guild ofAmerica, West.
Are you watching
the movies l recommended?
Yes! Love them. lrene Dunne is fantastic.
-Gumption.
-Oh, my God, tons of it.
Arthur, don't you want to open that letter
you just threw in the bin?
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.
-But it might be important.
-lt's not.
They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.
A night with me.
l don't know, it sounds God-awful.
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 1 00 years old,
and see 1 1 schnooks who showed up
just to see you?
They can forget it. l ain't falling for this.
So now what's up?
May l?
"An Evening with Arthur Abbott.
"Dear Mr. Abbott, having made several
attempts to contact you regarding...
"We have not yet received your response.
"...be called 'An Evening
with Arthur Abbott'...
"This special night will be a tribute
to your lifetime of achievement
"in screenwriting
and your outstanding contribution
"to the screenwriter's profession.
"Congratulations
on this much-deserved honor."
Arthur, this is a big deal, you know?
And they want to do this soon.
Listen. l reckon
that with a little bit of exercise,
you could walk out there on your own.
And... You know,
maybe l could go with you
as, like, your date or something.
l would take you proudly, my darling,
but l'm not going.
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.
Easy.
Doing really well.
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there. Bravo!
Here we go, back the other way.
-You okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine. Fine.
-You sure?
-Yeah, l just slipped.
-Hello.
-GRAHAM: So are you ever coming home?
-Oh, my God. Hi.
-How is it going?
-Great. l met a really nice guy.
-See? And you said you'd never.
-What's he like?
-He's really cute.
l feel great when l'm with him,
which is an entirely new experience.
-And he's about 90 years old.
-Come on!
He's my next door neighbor.
Or Amanda's next door neighbor.
Oh, by the way, you should pop over
and meet her.
-Yeah, l have, actually.
-Oh, bugger.
Call waiting. Can you hold for a sec?
-Hold on. l really want to talk to you.
-Sure.
-Hello?
-lris, hi. lt's Amanda.
-How are you? How's it going?
-Everything is going great. How are you?
l'm loving it. Listen, can you hold for a sec?
My brother is on the other line.
-Graham?
-Yes. He said you met.
-Yes, we did meet. How is he?
-Fine, I think.
-Can you just hold on for a sec?
-Sure.
-Okay. Hi. Sorry. That was Amanda.
-How did she sound?
-How is she doing?
-She just asked me how you are.
-And what did you say?
-l asked her to hold.
-Can l call you back?
-l can hold while you speak to her.
-Really?
-Find out how she is.
Okay.
My brother wants to know how you are.
Can you tell him that l'm good, and that l'm
just taking Charlie for a walk in the village?
-What's he been up to? Did he say?
-l'm not sure.
-Do you want me to ask him?
-Sure.
Okay. Hold, please.
l can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house.
-He told you that?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!
l thought l was talking to Graham!
Could you just hold, please?
l'm terribly sorry.
l can't believe you've had sex with Amanda!
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"
And l assured her that there were not.
And then you meet her
and immediately get into her knickers!
Still me.
Bollocks! l must have lost him.
Amanda, l am so sorry.
-Can l call you back?
-Sure.
Okay. Bye.
Yes, hello.
lt's Miles. Am l in trouble?
Oh, Miles. Hi.
-What are you up to this Christmas Eve?
-Not much,
but in a little bit l was gonna
go down to the video shop
-and get the next movie on Arthur's list.
-Do you want some company?
Love some.
Hey.
-l got you the best drink in town...
-Hi.
...but l didn't know if you'd like a little
dollop of whipped cream or a big dollop.
So l got both, and you can have each one...
Well, hello, big dollop!
-Say, you look great, by the way.
-Thanks.
-Really great.
-Thanks, l'm feeling good.
l've been working out with Arthur.
-What?
-No. l'm sure it's an awesome workout.
l'm sorry, l'm trying not to picture it.
Okay, well, the workout's not that great,
but the conversation's... Stop laughing!
-The conversation is truly fantastic.
-No, that l totally believe.
Now let me ask you. Have you seen this?
Chariots ofFire. Loved it.
Such a great score by Vangelis.
He took electronic scores to a new level.
lt was groundbreaking.
l'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay, Driving Miss Daisy. Hans.
Very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?
Sassy! Love it.
-ls this a bad game?
-No.
-Okay.
-Keep going.
Sometimes l get self-conscious about my...
And scraddIe da
Are you embarrassed
by this game l've started to play?
Okay. lt's not a library. l can go loud.
Two notes. And you've got a villain.
l don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.
Where have you gone,
Joe DiMaggio?
l bet you didn't know
that was all written for the movie.
-lt was a score technically.
-lRlS: l did know that one.
Can't go anywhere.
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out sometime.
The Mission. The score is genius.
lt just comes from a totally different place.
lt's like... l can't even...
Just promise me you'll rent it
and listen to it.
-Renting.
-Thank you.
lt changed my world.
What?
MlLES: Maggie!
-Why do l always fall for the bad girl?
-You didn't know she was a bad girl.
l knew she wasn't good.
Do you have anything a little bit stronger?
Thank you. Let me rephrase this.
Why am l attracted to a person
l know isn't good?
l happen to know the answer to this.
Because you're hoping you're wrong,
and every time she does something
that tells you she's no good, you ignore it,
and every time she comes through
and surprises you, she wins you over
and you lose that argument with yourself
that she's not for you.
Exactly.
And on top of that, there's the old standby,
"l can't believe a girl like that
"would actually be with a guy like me."
You know what she said to me tonight?
She said she finished in Santa Fe
after two days
and has been staying
with whatever-his-name-was,
which means she's been right here in town,
which means when l spoke to her
this morning on her cell,
and she said, "l'm looking
out my window and it's snowing,"
she was in Santa Monica.
What did she do? Go to weather.com?
That must've made them both
scream with laughter.
And in the meantime, l sent
her Christmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday.
l stood in line at FedEx
to make sure she got it on time.
-l know.
-Classic, right?
Look, l don't want to ruin
your Christmas Eve.
-You don't have to listen to this.
-lt's okay. l like the company.
So how about some food?
Shall l make us a little Christmas fettuccine?
-Sure.
-Listen.
l know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "l know how you feel,"
but l actually know how you feel.
You see, l was
seeing someone back in London.
We work for the same newspaper
and then l found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah,
from the circulation department
on the 1 9th floor.
lt turned out that he wasn't
in love with me like l thought.
What l'm trying to say is,
l understand feeling as small
and as insignificant as humanly possible,
and how it can actually ache in places
that you didn't know you had inside you,
and it doesn't matter
how many new haircuts you get
or gyms you join or how many glasses of
chardonnay you drink with your girlfriends,
you still go to bed every night
going over every detail,
and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.
And how in the hell, for that brief moment,
you could think that you were that happy?
And sometimes you can even
convince yourself that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.
And after all that,
however long all that may be,
you'll go somewhere new
and you'll meet people
who make you feel worthwhile again,
and little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.
And all that fuzzy stuff,
those years of your life that you wasted,
that will eventually begin to fade.
Well, fuck.
You need this more than l do.
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?
Yeah.
This is me in good shape.
ls this the guy who sent you
pages from his novel?
Yeah. He needs me.
-So he stays in touch?
-All the time.
So that makes it impossible to forget him,
which is great for him but sucks for you.
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?
Okay, let's go.
l'm making you some fettuccine.
lt is Christmas Eve,
and we are going to sit out on that patio,
gonna make ourselves a little fire,
gonna pop some bubbly,
and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.
-You with me, Simpkins?
-Miles.
-You really are an incredibly decent man.
-l know.
That's always been my problem.
Hi.
Okay. Here it is.
Arthur's theme.
l think this is really good.
l'm serious.
l'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it, it should give him
the confidence to walk right out there.
-Okay?
-Yeah.
Here we go.
Did l steal this?
-John Williams.
-l didn't write it. Why?
-Okay, this is it for real.
-Okay.
-Here we go.
-Yup.
A little Arthur in the nights here.
Right? lt's cheeky.
lt sounds like him.
l also wrote one that sounds like you.
You did?
lris, if you were a melody.
l used only the good notes.
Iris Iives next door
To Arthur
He's a doodley-do
-And also a doodley-do
-Scroodley-do
-A scroodley-do. ls it? l didn't know that.
-Yeah.
-And froodley-do
-Froodley-do
We both said froodley.
l'm impressed. You are a prodigy.
A doodle prodigy.
Scroodley-do
So you're totally great.
Yeah. This is a bitch.
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?
London? Never.
New York?
Not really. But that's easier.
Do you go there often?
Rarely.
Long-distance relationships can work,
you know.
Really? l can't make one work when l live
in the same house with someone.
So this could be a good solution for you.
Oh, man.
Okay.
Let's say we just make this happen.
We each commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.
Yes. lt's doable, definitely.
And then let's say,
in six months we hit a wall.
Like, l can't constantly be away from work
or the girls can't deal
with you leaving so often
and we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work,
so we start fighting
because we don't know what else to do
and then after a long, tearful, at your end,
phone call...
-Thank you
-...we say goodbye,
and that will be it for real.
lt's not like we're ever gonna
bump into each other.
And then what's left?
Two miserable people
feeling totally mashed up and hurt.
-Or...
-Thank you.
Or maybe, we should just realize
that what we've had these past few weeks
has been perfect
and maybe it won't get any better than this
and maybe we're trying
to figure this thing out
because it makes us feel so good
to feel this way
and maybe the fact
that l'm leaving in eight hours
makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.
Maybe.
You're seriously
the most depressing girl l've ever met.
l know.
-l have another scenario for you.
-Good.
l'm in love with you.
l apologize for the blunt delivery,
but as problematical as this fact may be,
l am in love with you.
And l'm not feeling this
because you're leaving
and not because it feels good
to feel this way,
which, by the way, it does,
or did before you went off like that.
l can't figure out the mathematics of this.
l just know l love you.
Can't believe how many times l'm saying it.
And l never thought l'd feel this way again
so that's pretty phenomenal.
And l realize l come with a package deal,
three for the price of one.
And my package, perhaps,
in the light of day isn't all that wonderful,
but l finally know what l want
and that in itself is a miracle.
And what l want is you.
l wasn't expecting "l love you".
Can you not look at me like that?
l'm trying to find the right thing to say.
l think if the obvious response
doesn't immediately come to you,
we can just...
We should just talk about something else,
like possibly what a complete arse l am.
l do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.
Must pay better attention.
l've never met a guy
who talks as much as me,
but could you just for now be quiet, please?
MlLES: How many of those movies
are on that list of his?
lRlS: About 1 5. l love it.
l don't know how l've never seen
The Lady Eve before.
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.
-She's so sure of herself.
-Sexy.
Really sexy.
You know, every movie he's told me to see
has this powerhouse woman in it.
Wonder if he's trying to tell you something
with that.
Okay. Sorry about that. Boob graze.
That was accidental. Accidental boob graze.
l'm sorry.
-Change of subject.
-Okay.
Arthur has requested that you write
some lyrics for his theme song.
-What's the matter? Who is it?
-lt's Maggie.
Hello?
Hi.
l'm doing okay.
Actually, Maggie,
l'm a bit tied up at the moment.
l don't know. What time could you be there?
All right. l'll be there.
Oh, no, no, like, a half hour.
Maybe a little longer.
Okay. Bye.
She misses me.
You see, she came to her senses.
We should get the bill.
No. No, no, no. Take your time.
l can wait till you're finished.
-l'm finished.
-No, you didn't even get your spicy tuna yet.
l'm fine, really.
You can go. l can get this one.
l'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
l mean, if you can still make it.
l gotta get all the way over to Silver Lake,
but l'm gonna try to be there.
Anyway, l'm bringing the music.
l mean, l really want to be there, but l don't
know how long this is gonna take.
Oh, l'm sorry.
lt's all good. Don't worry.
-Good luck.
-Thank you.
Hello.
Oh, Jasper. l'm just reading your pages.
No, l hadn't forgotten,
l've just been busy, that's all.
That's not true.
l was gonna call you when l'd...
What kind of surprise?
No, l don't see a box or anything.
Yes, l'm sure.
Hold on. Let me just check the kitchen.
No. Not in there.
Well, l'll go and check the gate. Yes.
Well, when did you send it?
l found your Christmas present.
-This place suits you.
-Yeah, right.
No, really.
So you are eventually gonna look at me,
aren't you?
Hello.
l came here because l had to see you.
Had to.
Oh, Jasper, l really don't understand this.
l mean, l was right there
for three years, remember?
"Square peg, round hole"?
That's what you said to me once,
that we weren't really right for each other.
We were a square peg and a round hole.
Well, l don't remember that.
l just know that l hated when you were gone
and also l've never checked
my e-mails more.
lt was driving me crazy
that l wasn't hearing from you.
l don't wanna lose you, babe.
Lose me?
This is too confusing.
Come here.
l screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?
l made a mistake.
l was stupid and impulsive.
He wasn't what l thought
and l just started thinking about you
and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.
Will you, Miles? Will you forgive me?
JASPER: You know what l was thinking?
When you get back to London, maybe
we could sneak off somewhere together.
Maybe Venice.
You and me in Venice could be good.
Do you mean that? l mean,
are you free to do that?
Darling, l've just traveled halfway
across the world to see you, haven't l?
You know, that didn't exactly
answer my question.
So are you not with Sarah any more?
l mean, is that what you've come here
to tell me?
l wish you could just accept knowing
how confused l am about all this.
Okay, let me translate that.
So you are still engaged to be married?
-Yes, but... l mean...
-Oh, my God.
Well, this was a really close call.
You know, l never thought l'd say this,
literally never,
but l think
you were absolutely right about us.
Very square peg, very round hole.
-You cannot mean that.
-The great thing is l actually do
and l'm about three years late
in telling you this,
but nevertheless l need to say it.
Jasper... Wait, l need the lights on.
Jasper,
-you have never treated me right, ever.
-Oh, babe...
Shush.
You broke my heart
and you acted like somehow it was my fault,
my misunderstanding,
and l was too in love with you
to ever be mad at you
so l just punished myself for years!
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday
and telling me that you don't want to lose
me whilst you're about to get married,
somehow newly entitles me to say
it's over.
This... This...
This twisted, toxic thing between us
is finally finished.
l'm miraculously done
being in love with you.
l've got a life to start living.
-And you're not going to be in it.
-Darling...
Now l've got somewhere
really important to be
and you have got to get the hell out.
Now!
-What exactly has got into you?
-l don't know.
But l think what l've got
is something slightly resembling gumption.
lris. You're a knockout.
Thank you, and may l say, so are you.
Did l do my tie okay?
l haven't worn one in 1 5 years.
Perfect.
l like this Hugo Boss. He cuts a nice suit.
l've got something for you.
Oh.
Forgive me. The last time l had a date,
this is what we did.
lt's beautiful.
lf it's corny, or if it's gonna ruin your outfit,
you don't have to wear it.
l like corny.
l'm looking for corny in my life.
-That's a nice line.
-lt's all those movies.
Okay, let's do it.
Let's get this embarrassment
over with. Okay.
-Mr. Abbott?
-Yes, sir.
We're all ready for you.
Please.
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott.
Oh, hi.
-You look great.
-And you, too.
Thank you very much.
l'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.
Go on. Go. l'm so proud.
l'll do it.
The man is a rock star.
Hi.
Sorry l'm late.
The Maggie thing took a little time,
but it is over, finished, kaput.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you, thank you.
l'm absolutely overwhelmed
that l could climb those stairs.
l came to Hollywood over 60 years ago
and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures
and it's a love affair that's lasted a lifetime.
When I first arrived in Tinseltown,
there were no cineplexes or multiplexes,
no such thing as a blockbuster or DVD.
l was here
before conglomerates owned the studios,
before pictures had special effects teams
and definitely before box-office results
were reported
like baseball scores on the nightly news.
He is so fantastic.
-lris.
-Yes.
What are you doing New Year's Eve?
-l'll be back in England by New Year's Eve.
-Oh.
You know, l've never been to England.
l've never been to Europe.
No?
lf l come over there,
will you go out with me on New Year's Eve?
Love to.
Okay, so we're not gonna make
a bigger deal out of this than it already is.
No, we're not.
lt's not like we're never going to speak
or e-mail or...
-No set rules.
-None.
So now l'm just gonna kiss you
for the millionth time
and say, "Be seeing you."
Be seeing you.
And take care of yourself.
-You have a good holiday, miss?
-Yeah.
Great.
Maybe the best ever.
NARRATOR: Amanda Woods, weIcome back.
Turn around.
Turn around and go back, please.
-Did you forget something?
-Yes. Yes.
Can you go any faster?
This little lane's always tricky.
lt's gonna take a bit.
lt's okay, just stop.
Madam.
Graham!
Graham.
You know, l was just thinking,
why would l ever leave
before New Year's Eve?
That makes no sense at all.
l mean, you didn't exactly ask me out,
but you did say you loved me
so l'm thinking l've got a date,
if you'll have me.
l have the girls New Year's Eve.
Sounds perfect.
Hi.
Yes. l'll put you
on top of the Christmas tree.
Sophie, give us a kiss.
Come and tell me
all about your Christmas presents.
Go and sit with Miles.
Okay, well, you know who that is.
Sweetie.
This is amazing.
Can't believe he'd ever come here.
He's just so fantastic.
l've never seen you so happy.
-l challenge you.
-Me?
Oh, yeah.
SOPHlE: Yeah, yeah!
OLlVlA: Yeah, yeah!
MlLES: Happy New Year!
lRlS: Happy New Year!
GRAHAM: Happy New Year!
AMANDA: Happy New Year everybody!
