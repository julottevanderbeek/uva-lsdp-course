Quiet on the set and we're rolling
Cody Maverick interview take 1
So why are you guys here to interview me?
It's what we do, we're a reality film crew
Should I know some of the questions before we start?
Just so I don't...
No, uhh...they're, they're easy
Okay
Could you stand on that box right there please?
Oh, yeah
Whoa...Whoa, what is that, what is that sound thing?
It's a microphone
What's up man? I'm Cody.
And you're what 14, 15 years old?
uh...17 years of age
And, uh any other skills besides surfing?
Like what? Singing and dancing?
yeah, yeah
No, not me man, I just surf.
Loser...
Cut it out Glen, stop man.
You know we're here to make a movie about Cody.
Does he have to be here?
Yeah, it's gonna be great
Can I get in line now to not see it?
Since we're talking about surfing why don't you give us your
thoughts about surfing.
Surfing...Surfing...where do I start?
How about just at the beginning?
Ok, well, uh...so as soon as there was the first wave, right?
There was the first surfer.
All they needed was like uh, um, something like a piece of driftwood,
block of ice, or something like that
and then they were off.
And they were hooked man
they were hooked.
Up 'til recent times you had your old dudes
you know, you're hang 6 cats, these old guys
used to lay down with these huge, humongous boards
These guys were the pioneers, but nobody saw what surfing could really be.
Until Big Z did it.
Could you tell us who Big Z was?
Who was Big Z?
You're asking the right guy, you got that part...
Big Z is everything, Big Z is surfing
and I mean he's...they invented the ocean for him.
He lived so hard, because he wasn't afraid to live
he wasn't afraid to die.
He came to Antartica when I was just a kid
Man, he just  he was the biggest thing that ever happened here.
Suddenly there he was
just
floating over the water, just hovering, you know, like weightless.
Could have walked up anyone
and he walks right up to me.
He gives me this awesome, one of a kind, Big Z necklace
and then he tells me you know kid, never give up,
to find a way, because that's what winners do.
He was the greatest.
Every one looked up to him, respected him, loved him.
And, one day...one day, I'm going to be just like him.
I've been surfing ever since I can remember
it's hard to imagine any part of my life when I wasn't surfing.
I want to get out of here,
you know, and this is my ticket out.
I'm really good man,
I'm the best on the island.
I know it sounds cocky saying that
but I am...like the best.
Yeah, I was born and raised here in Shiverpool
lived here my whole life.
This is where the sort the fish
it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.
But, yeah, I worked there just to kind of pacify my mom a little bit.
Good 'ole Shiverpool
this place sucks bro'.
I worked my way up from the sardine pile
then to the mackeral pile...all hard work.
My house...it's down over there, see it right there with the surf boards.
Yeah, I just live here with me, my brother Glen, my Mom.
He was a little, teeny small egg,
he wasn't very impressive.
Glen was the big egg, Cody was the small egg
he can't help it, you know, that's just the way he is.
I mean he's out there in the water all day,
shirking his responsibilities.
Hatching these eggs is a big responsibility
my brother Cody, he just doesn't understand that.
Step up and be a man.
Takes a real man to sit on an egg.
You know it.
He wants to be different, all the time with the different...
Thanks for making it...
yeah, sorry, just too good to miss.
Yeah, thanks for making it.
Yeah how was it out there?
He's the big brother, I'm the little brother.
I'm not touchin' ya
not gonna touch ya.
Do you see this?
He makes sure that I know that too
I had to fight for everything
even Mom's tuna casserole, you know?
I'm lucky I survived.
It really wasn't that easy for him
growing up.
Like I said, before, uh...
he never, he never really knew his father.
I'm not really the person to ask about it truthfully
because I was just too young to remember.
I mean look I'm not the only kid on the island
who's Dad, was you know,  eaten.
Still...it had to be tramatic.
No, not for me bro'... not for me.
What's your dream?
To go ... uh, uh ... away.
To go away, that's, that's great.
Do you guys want a drink?
Gotta run away...
They don't want a drink.
...shirk responsibility and life.
This is kind of, this is unique, this is, this is not the norm, so uh...
Thbbbtttt!
When is this not happening?
What?  Don't make that noise.
Thbbbbbbttttttt!
Cody!
It's really disrespectful.
Thbbbbtttt!
I would never do that.
Mmmhmm.
You just wouldn't make it out of your mouth.
You know what?
That's the difference between you and me.
You know what?  I can't do this anymore.
Look what you did!
This is for me, this isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?
Exactly!  Mom!
I don't understand why everybody has to be so judgemental
I understand why Mom's judgemental
I think it's because she cares partially.
I think it's also partially because everyone else is lookin' at her like
hey Cody's just a bum, Cody's this, Cody's that, Cody's this.
Cody's me bro' ...let me be me.
When is that gonna start?
You know what they call me?
The dreammaker, the dream...maker.
I find these kids, I bring them here
and I give them a chance to be somebody.
You know, my greatest joy as surf promoter?
Finding Z.  Watching him rise to the top.
I still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know.
It was a heart thing, you know, it was a heart...
give me like just 5 minutes.
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
'Cause I ain't got all day...shut up.
Is it mussed?  Is it mussed?
We just have a few more questions about Big Z.
But, right now I think we're more interested in
telling the Reggie Bellafonte story and who could blame us?
But Big Z is kind of the focus of our ...
Hey lets get the coconut filler guy over here
and how about the guy sweeping the sand?
Can we hear your boring story about
your tedious, worthless...
Hmmm? Me?
...ridiculous life?
Get your feathers off me!
Stop!  Stop!
I haven't got all day
I've got a big production here.
Roll it okay, just roll it!
Welcome fans to another edition of SPEN sports!
This is Zel Masacala and we're here at the
surfing capital of the world...Pen Gu Island.
For a preview of the 10th annual
Big Z Memorial Surf Off.
Professional surfers extrordinare...
Kelly and Rob, tell us...
What kind of challenges our surfers are going to face?
Well, first things first, Zel, the waves
it's the perfect combination of beauty and danger.
Even the pros are terrified of this place.
Dig this Zel, the section behind me
it's called the boneyards.
Very few surfers have ventured in there and come out alive.
Are you trying to tell me people have died here?
That's right Zel.
Moment of silence for them...
And, we keep it moving
because if the boneyards was not enough
our surfers will be facing off with
Tank the Shredder Evans.
Tank, 9 time defending champ.
A role model? No, but I do consider myself
somebody everyone should look up to.
Kids should try to uh, pretend that they're Tank.
I mean they should try .  Good luck kids.
You never want to get in there and, you know, like help them out
and show them how to surf and spend some time with the kids?
No, no I don't want to do that, anyway this is my wave.
Always classy, Tank Evans...coming up after the break, penguin dodge ball.
Stick around!
Okay, to get to the competion I just want to say, uh
I'm scouring the globe for the next big thing
but that's another story.
He doesn't look for them, I find them
I find these penguins I find the talent.
Reggie, my boss, has sent me literally everywhere on this trip.
Any place there's an ocean, a lake, a puddle...it's ridiculous.
I am on so much migraine medication, you have no idea.
The stress is killing me I don't know how much longer I can last
I have to tell you that right now.
You gotta try the blowhole thing man this whale dude is giving me a brain freeze.
I, uh, I lost a bet.
Excuse me, excuse me, does this entire frozen wasteland surf?
Ah...the Cody Maverick kid does that.
Wonderful, thank you.
You know you're sittin' on thin ice.
Excuse me, I looking for uh, I'm looking for Cody Maverick,
has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
I'm, I'm Cody Maverick.
Mikey Abromowitz from the Big Z Memorial Surf Off...Pen Gu Island.
Quite a slip and slider aren't ya?
What an honor sir, honestly what an honor.
I hear you, uh, surf is this true?
Listen, you gotta see what I can do, please?
You can actually stand on a board?
I'll be right back, then you're gonna see what I can do
then you're gonna be happy, everthing's gonna be good, and then I'm coming with you.
I can't imagine a better day.
Ma, Ma, Ma, the scout, Mikey he came, he came, he's here
he's giving me a shot now Ma, will you come watch me surf?
No, no that's okay.
Just this time?
I'm busy, I'm chopping here.
Uh, oh, okay, alright wish me luck.
Cody, just be careful of those big waves.
Well, anytime now.
You know you should have been here yesterday
we had a sweet swell yesterday
I was doing some layback 360's, some floaters, it was insane.
Whoa! Start the whale.
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait

You just had it.
Better luck next year.
Come on, let's go

I never won anything my whole life
you know, just once I want to feel like a winner.
You know I used to scout songbirds
toucans, for this musical review in Brazil.
Now that's show business.
I don't care what you say, I'm coming to Pen Gu.
No way, no how
this is a contest
for big wave surfers.
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
No, no, no no nooo!
Eh, poor kid, I feel bad a little bit, honestly.
Wait, wait.

Yeah, so anyway...
We got ya, we got ya

Thanks, Joe.
Don't you ever, ever do anything like that in the contest, alright?
Yeah, you're in, 'cause that was entertaining
in a horrifying sort of way.
Yeah, alright, alright!
My name's Cody Maverick, Shiverpool, you?
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.
Where are you from?
Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan

Oh man, I'm in love.

No I'm not going to talk to her.
She diggin' on ya...she called you crap.
Thanks again.
Alright, well this is the 3rd time you've been unconscience this week
I just don't think it's very good for your brain.
I know.

that was just unbelievable, really.
You here for the surf contest.
Uh, mmhmm.
Well, I'll be watching you.
Really?  You'll be watching me?
Well, yeah, from the lifeguard station.
Oh, yeah, well...
It's my job.

C'mon Joe.
Dude, you were saying you were in love with her.
No, I didn't say that.
Alright look, he really diggs ya...
Shhhh!
See ya!
Yeah, I love my job I have an amazing job
just this week with the contest coming up and all it's a little crazy.
You really have to be extra, extra attentive.
You have so many guys in the water you can't miss a thing.
But you know what?
I have a perfect record, I've never lost anybody.
Sure, there have been close calls...
Help! Help!
Oh, Arnold I turn my back for one...
Just lay some feeling on her, you know through words...
Walk me through the approach, I'm Lani, you're me.
You sure about that? I get real serious.
Let's, no...let's, no.
Whoa...
What is it?
That's it, that's Big Z's shrine, remember?
Yyyea...no, no not really.
Today the world of surfing lost one of it's legends.
Big Z took his final ride this morning during a competition
with up and coming surfer, Tank Evans.
Z was last seen paddling into a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.
Friends of Big Z gathered to remember and celebrate his life.
Great shot!  Yes...everytime!
Hey!  Stop doing that! Stop cut it out.
That's like 3 in row.
Here, give it a shot.
Hey! what? wait a minute, look at this...it's a Big Z necklace.
That's not funny, stop, hey no stop, what are you doing?
Look everybody, it's Big Z's last fan...
Coming through, out of the way
We deserve to talk about this...
He's a big zero...
Shut your mouth.
...zero starts with Z!
You'll never be as good as Big Z, Stank.
Ohhhhh.....
Hey, hey people, c'mon now, smile on your brother.
Keep your girlfriend out of this.
Hey, whoa...you can't do that to my friend.
Wow, you're getting quite a workout there, oh, that feels good.
Hey, why don't you work on my glutes a little bit?
Ewww...that's very nice.
Whoa, whoa, whoa alright, that's enough guys, c'mon.
I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.
Oh, well then, how about right here right now, huh?
Hey, Mikey, Mikey, get this kid a board.
Alright, who wants to see the little guy take on the champ?
Little guys rule!
A little one on one surfing action between Tank Evans and...
Jerry...Cody, Cody...Cody Maverick, Cory Mavencourt.
And the one that rides the biggest wave, wins!
Are you nervous about going against Tank Evans today?
Ahh, Tank, what do I have to be nervous about?
I'm going to chum the water with your head!
Bring it on pecker face, let's go.
Pecker face?
So, Cody, when you take your first wave and the whole island's there to watch
what's it gonna be like?
It's going to be amazing, honestly, it's going to be the best wave of my life
and I hope the cameras are rolling 'cause you're gonna want to watch it
over and over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhhhhhh!
I can't look poor kid
That was spectacular, whoa!
I'm number one...The TANK!!!
We're trying to get the details, we're trying to figure it out,
the lifeguard just pulled him in.
That's what happens when you take on the Tank, right?
Cody, Cody, how is he is he okay, what can I do?
I can help though, except if there's blood, just the thought of blood makes me...
Somebody help the chicken.
Tank, you okay?  Tank needs fuel.
Mikey get the board will ya?
Did I win? I won, huh?
You should have stayed in Antartica, kid.
You're going to be okay.
There's pixies everywhere.
What do you guys think about Cody going into a contest
and possibly winning?
You know I'm, I'm...
Why did you just laugh?
Because he keeps saying possible
like it's possible that you're going to win
and like you're going to do anything
I mean, really, what are the chances?
They're high, aren't they high?
I mean they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm like the underdog.
Hey Geek, Geek, Geek help
Geek
Geek...wake up! I need your help.
Lani
C'mon get off your lazy butt and come help me.
...beautiful dream
Okay
Do you know Sheila?
No, I don't know Sheila.
Wait, wait, wait, who's this guy?
He's a surfer, he's hurt.
Who are those guys?
They're with him ignore them.
Lani, Lani, what are you doing?
They'll go away.
Hey, get outta here.
Help him!
Where do want him?
Nowhere, that's the whole point.
No outsiders Lani, c'mon.
I know, I know, I know
this is an emergency he went down bad over the falls
I don't if he, if he...
And did he hit the reef?
I don't know, I'm not sure...I got him after...
Is he your boyfriend?
No, no...
Whoa, looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.
Stepped on me? Stepped on me?
Are you kidding? This guy was dancing on me.
I mean just look at this
broken, broken, gone, gone, broken, broken...broken.
This is, this pretty bad
this is really bad.
Oww! Oww!
Cody, you're alright, you're going to be okay.
Uh, maybe I shouldn't have taken that out
uh, poison's released, it's amazing
What's amazing?
That you're still alive.
It's alright, though, I'm gonna fix ya up.
I can fix your foot just fine.
Where is it?
A saw, he's got a saw!
Oww, Oww!
He's pushing the poison all over his body.
There it is.
What are you doing?
What is he doing?
This is a surefire cure I learned it from an old medicine man
that could, uh, well, works wonders.
What, no! Not that!
Not what, not what, what's he going to do?!
C'mon now...Geek stop...let's do this
Lani, make some water sounds.
Oh my gosh, this is so gross.
No, no, no, no...
Ahhh!
You better keep your mouth shut.
See, what did I tell ya?
Hold his foot still, Lani.
C'mon, knock him out or something I'm running on empty here.
I'm trying.
So, how ya been?
Wow, sea urchin in the foot that sounds pretty nasty.
Yeah
How do you cure something like that?
You pee on it.
Ahh, that's disgusting...I know!
How long am I stuck with this guy?
Until he's better.
Well, come back soon and please bring me some clams.
No.
I'm running low here.
No, I can't keep doing this
you gotta start taking care of yourself.
Bye.
I need some more clams!
O-Kay!
If it's just as well with you, I don't want to talk about Cody.
He lost, that's it, that's his problem, not mine.
Aren't you concerned about anybody's well-being?
The kids fine, he was born in the water
he's a penguin for crying out loud.
Did you see that wave hit him?
Yeah, dude, that's the whole idea of surfing.
I care, I care!
Mikey! wait 'til you see this
look at those little legs
tick, tick, tickey, tick, tick, tickey, tickey, tickey
boom cha cha, boom cha cha, boom cha cha
What's with the boom chicka boom?
I can't stand the sight of blood
I can't stand the sight of blood
I can't stand the sight of blood...Cody!
Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
Hmmuhh, no.
Cody?
He's not under there.
Coooooddddyyyy!
How's it goin' man?
Yeah so I woke up this morning and didn't know where I was
that's never a good place to be when you wake up.
C'mon...get up
No.
Breakfast.
Wakey, wakey, c'mon.
I don't want to.
Ow!
How's your foot?
My foot's fine, but my head!
Good, good, good, c'mon.
What the...
Shoo!
Hey, I uh, think I got a concussion.
You know, you should meet my brother Glen
you guys would really hit off.
No, no, no  have you seen my necklace?
Ah, big deal, get yourself another one at Reggies trinket shops.
No, it's not just some necklace guy, alright, he gave it me himself.
Who?
Big Z when he came to shiverpool.
That guy believed in me when nobody else did.
He told me never to give up and to find a way 'cause that's what winners do.
yeah, that's what winners do.
It's funny, you know, what a loser I became.
Who cares what Big Z said?
You gotta do things your own way.
I don't, I don't have a way.
Ah, well, you do now, just follow this, it'll take you back to North Beach.
Okay, nice to meet ya, Good Luck.
What do I do now? I can't show my face on the beach
I can't go home.
Do you always visualize what you're going to be, what you're going to do?
This ain't it.
What are you doing here?
Ah, man, thank you man, this...
that's really cool of you to come back, thank you.
Better keep that knot tight.
You lose it during a contest, it's a goner.
Yeah, well, I'm not going in any surf contest.
Ah, well, there's more to surfing than beating Tank Evans, you know.
Look at that, you know what you're sitting on there?
Huh?
That's kola wood, best surf boards in the world are made of that stuff.
Yeah?
You got a kola board?
No, I don't have a board, board.
Well, you want to make one?
No.
What?! Man, I come all the way back here to give you the necklace
and now I'm offering to make you a board and you say no?!
Get off your lazy butt, we're making a board, c'mon.
Alright, okay.
It's going to be the best board you ever had, I'll tell you that.
Then, okay...okay.
Alright.
Okay Man.
Cody...that's cool.
Joe, can you just tell us why you're out here looking for Cody?
You know, we've known each other since way back since
like yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common, you know I never really knew my father either.
Ok, so why are you making surf boards in the middle of the jungle
anyway?  I'm just trying to understand, man I don't get it you know?
Forget the 20 questions, let's just get the board made, hmm?
Okay, it's just...are you a surfer or do you, I mean, what...
Ah, ha, very funny.
Less talk more pushing, c'mon.
Why are we pushing it anyway, why don't we just roll it?
Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I didn't know your foot was there
are you okay? I'm sorry.
Owww!
I'm sorry! It's not like I intentionally did it, okay, I'm sorry.
Hey, oh, hey...Cody, Cody, the log!
Get it Geek, Geek, stop...stop, stop!
Cody, grab the vine, grab the vine...
...now pull it
I'm trying!
Ahhh, Cody!!!
Ahhhh, Geek!!!
Cody...
Ahhhh Geek!!!
Oh, no, no, no, no...no
Help me up so I can kick your butt.
I thought you were, I thought I killed you, you okay?
Next time when I say don't roll the...
What's that?  What's that?
Yeah, the beach...sand, water, sun, you seen one you seen 'em all
c'mon, let's get out of here.
No, No, c'mon man let's go check it out.
Ow.
Ahhh!
So, you think Cody and the Geek are doing alright?
Yeah, yeah, I hate to see him living out there all alone
it'll be good for him to have something to do.
Hey, somebody's old board shack.
Look at this...whoa, whoa, whoa...these are Big Z's boards.
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards, he rode this in the Australian Open.
This the board he rode when he came to Shiverpool, man.
This, I, I can't...Geek, this is Big Z's place man!
It's where he lived, this is where he made his boards.
Did you know this was here?
Why didn't you want to come down here?
...and then he, uh, he went up to this old shack, you know?
And I realized, you know, it was Z.
I could tell...he needed some space and you know
some time to himself, I didn't want to you know, ask him all these questions.
So, I just kind of stood there quietly...
You're Big Z! Aha, I can't believe it you're alive!
You're alive!
That's the respectful way to go I think.
Why are you alive? What happened, tell me, tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and oh, just tell me!
Kid, kid, kid, you're going to hurt yourself, relax.
but you were dead, right? People said you were dead
but you're not dead, you're in hiding...
...did something happen? Something happened
you saw something...you saw something you weren't supposed to see.
I knew it...that's what happened!
What are you nuts?  It's not a conspiracy
it's no big deal.
Oh, what happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, okay I got it I'll be over if you need anything or if
feel like talking or you know, whatever, do you feel like it now?
Like talking now?
Go away.
Got it, alright I'm going away, unless you...
Cody...
I'm not going to lie to you, this is like, you know
it's huge man, it changes everything, it's like
the contest is a few days away, if I can get him to train me
then that's...boom.
I mean I could win this with him.
It's my dream, you know?
And I don't want to give up on that dream
winners, winners find a way no matter what, right?
A winner is...
They see their goals, they just go for it
they're not in it for the money or the glory.
A winner is like...
It's the surfer that's out there having the most fun.
Yep, it's a lot of fun.
Right, no, I get ya, what's winning without the losers?
They're in it for the joy of it, the rapture and slow motion instant replays
Mikey, why don't you head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shutup!
Feels better when there's a lot of losers around
was that your question?
Well, a winner is somebody who doesn't knock me off my
surfboard, break it when I'm trying to get some big waves
especially Tank, he is definitely not a winner.
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.
Yeah, I can't remember a time when I wasn't surfing, my Mom
put me right on there, I think she pooped me out and put me right on there.
What is about surfing that you love?
I love being the center of attention, because
it's really where I should be
and uh, I love the looks my ladies give me.
You know the little glint, I love that, I love holding the ladies.
You know what I'm talking about?
Uh, I think so, sort of.
Come on, come with me.
I put this curtain in myself.
These are my ladies.
This is Jill, this is my lady, Amy, little Suzy, Brianna
you know why we call her Brianna, right?
No.
It's a long story.
Shaniqua, Helga, Miss Kitty, Jeanie, I dream of...
Teresa.
This is Teresa right here.
Now is Teresa is that your...
Dirty girl.
This spot, this spot is for my special lady, Lia.
I'm going to say that one more time...Lia.
Oh yeah, that's a sweet, sweet lady.
Tank are you polishing your trophies again?!
Mom, I wasn't polishing, I was talking to my friends.
I'm going to polish them later.
Mr. Topenga, Mr. Topenga, can you tell us why you're not dead?
No, I am dead.
What are you doing?
Hey, who said you could...turn the board around, get back here.
No, just come out here and show me some moves.
No, no, no.
Ah, why not, grab a board and come out.
Hey, you want to kill yourself, go ahead, fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.
How do you turn this thing?
It's not a short board, sit back on it.
Hey, watch the wave.
You mess up my board, I'm messing up your other foot.
Hey, I'm just trying to ride this canoe or whatever, okay?
Well, stop trying so hard...relax.
What do mean relax?!
Long smooth strokes, dig deep, dig, come on.
I'm digging, I'm digging!
Keep the nose up, keep it up, watch it...
What are you doing?
Come on, please?
Z, I can't learn anything with you on the beach, man.
Well, then you're not going to learn anything.
Now, come on in.
Z, I'm not coming in until you come out.
Oh, you're coming in alright.
He's not even watching the wave.
What wave?
That one.
Ahhhh!
Don't touch my stuff man.
I couldn't help it, I just wanted to learn from the best.
Ah, well, I don't surf anymore.
What? What do mean you don't surf anymore?
Hey, hey, you want to learn how to surf the right way?
Uhhh...sure.
Then you got to make your own board, alright?
What do you mean you don't...
Can't hear you.
Can I just ask one question about...
I'm making a board.
Can you tell me about your board?
Umm, I just have a uh, palm tree board
I would have to say it's not the nicest board
in the world, but it is a pretty good board.
The ancient Hawaiians believe that mana, or heart,
was transfered into the surfboard as you shaved it.
What are your thoughts on that?
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.
My dream surfboard is pretty powerful
you can add a lot of attachments to it
like a grenade launcher attachment.
Anybody know whose board this is?
I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
Has anybody seen the chicken?
Cody!
I know he's out there.
I can feel it in my nuggets.
Man, aren't you nervous out here Joe, in the jungle
it's kind of dangerous.
Dude, the jungle is the most peaceful place on the planet.
Hold it steady.
This is dream come true, this is a dream come true.
Here...to be here with Z doing this
and it's kola wood which all the best boards are made of kola wood.
Alright, now...
...I drew this pattern as a guide.
Do you want to have your board with a lot of rocker
or just a little?
Uhh, I don't know, I guess I'd like...
What you want is something in between, trust me.
I'm the expert here, okay?
Okay.
So, um, here are your shaping tools
now remember, the board is already inside there
see, somewhere and what you're doing is
you're trying to find it, reveal it.
Okay...okay.
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.
I'm not, I'm not smiling, I'm just you know, I'm excited.
This isn't like hacking a piece of ice
you know it takes patience and finesse.
Alright already, I'm trying, will you just give me the tools, please?
Alright here, take it, go ahead...
Thank you.
Here we go...
What are you doing?
Look, if you're going to do it, you do it right.
Alright, look, push the bowl with the grain
with the grain, you see what I'm doing here?
You let the tool do the work, you see?
Just like you're riding a wave, you let the wave
do the work, you don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves, Cod...
Long strokes, loads of finesse, find the board within the tree.
Nice and easy.
Yeah, I got it.
See that you just, just...
Maybe I can do it now...
...move with, with the...
Can I do it now?
Can I do it now?
Yeah, got carried away, sorry about that
it's your board.
...my board.
Okay, with the grain, I got it.
Don't forget to eyeball it once in awhile.
Okay, long strokes with the grain.
Not too long.
Here we go.
You're doing it wrong, Cod...
Will you just, will you just let me...I can't...
...no finesse when you're in my face!
Okay?  Just let me make the board.
Do you want my help?
Do I...no, I don't want your help.
I don't want your help.
Oh, you don't want my help.
I don't want your help.
Oh, alright, fine.
I just want to make my board.
Build the board yourself man, alright?
Thank you, thank you.
I don't care what the board looks like
you're the one whose got to ride the board.
Fine, thank you.
It's here somewhere, go find it.
Walk over there, please...please.
Don't cut yourself.
So it's day 3, yeah, I uh, I come across Pen Guins.
I'm Chicken Joe, Joseph, it's long for Joe.
Hey, hey oooooo!
Sweet man.
...and uh, they treat me as their king and put me in a hot tub.
It was I guess their royal hot tub.
I'm kind of hot and steamy, but it really opened up my pores, you know?
It was kind of cool, they kind of served me food while I was in there.
It was like dinner and a show.
As enjoyable as it was, I still had a vision of my quest.
Thank you.
See you guys later, I got to get going.
You know what else it was...
Look, okay, I had the board, the board was fine, the board was great.
How's it goin' ?
What? no, it's going great man, it's great.
It did look a little rough, you know?
A little rough?  The board looked a little rough?
It's a work in progress, bro' .
You think it's good enough for the big waves?
I think it's good enough for any waves.
Ohh, ohh, ohh.
Uh, hang on.
Okay, let's say I'm a big wave, you know...
Hold on! No, no, no, no, no....
Where you going?
It's my board man, alright?
Why don't you take your board and go try it out?
That's what I'm...maybe I will.
Good.
Piece of junk, watch...
Oh...that was...nice ride, man.
Nice ride.
You know, this is supposed to be fun.
Look, I got 3 days until the contest, I don't have time for fun.
No time for fun, huh?
Hey Cody...
What?!
bring me some clams when you come back.
I'm not coming back.
He'll be back.
No I won't!
He'll be back.
Hey, you guys like barbeque?
Yeah...sure.
We got some wood here.
I wasted my whole day and I have nothing to show for it...
Lani.
I was just actually going to check on you.
That's why you were...
...Geek
Listen, Geek...Geek is Big Z.
What?  I know.
How did you find out?
We went to the beach...
You got him down to the beach?
Yeah.
I've been trying to get Z out of that tree for 10 years
and you got him all the way down to the beach in one day?!
Yeah.
This is fantastic! Woo hoo!
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?
Do you want to go somewhere really, really fun?
Unless you want to get, Did you want to get back to Big Z?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have invited you.
No, no, no, no.
Look, I want to have fun.
Oh, okay.
Do I need like mints or something?
No, you won't need mints.
Z used to carry us up here on his shoulders
and we'd have so much fun
it's one of my favorite spots on Pen Gu.
Really?
Oh, to be 8 years old again.
What is this?
You don't want to get all cut up do you?
Hold on, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no...I'm out of here.
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Stop fighting it Cody, just let go!
I'm in front of you now!
Okay, don't take the left...Cody!
Give up slowpoke, it's over!
Not for long!
Ha, ha, ha...I beat you!
Congratulations...you sure did!
You should probably get out of there.
Why's that?  This stuff is slickety, it's so beautiful look at it!
What is this stuff?
See those things up above you?
Uh-huh.
They're glow worms...so
you're right beneath them.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's poop.
You know how some stinks, stink, and other stinks smell good?
Yeah.
This is like a good stink.
A good stink?
Can I tell you something personal?
We're in the shower together, you can say whatever you want.
I'm serious!
I'm really, really, really jealous of you.
Why?
I couldn't get Z off his butt for the last 10 years and you come along
...he must really think a lot of you.
I don't know, I've been a jerk to him so I don't know what he thinks about me.
No you haven't.  I have, I've been a jerk to him.
Then go, not be a jerk.
Why does it matter to you anyways?
He's my uncle. He's the only family I've got.
...okay.
Z, no, don't you do it, Z, don't do it, no...I swear man...
If you break it...
It should have been broken by now.
Come on, man, come on!
Look at that, that's the best place in the world to be...in the tube.
Really?
Ah, yeah, better than winning.
The trophy...all that stuff.
Tube riding is the ultimate, ultimate thing in surfing
to ride inside the wave and make it out of it
it's all we want to do every day.
Oh, it's, it's almost impossible to describe
there's nothing I can compare it to.
It's a feeling, that, um, you know not too many people will experience
and uh, and uh, so it's special in that sense.
And then you just try to remember it, your like geez
I wish I could remember that or I wish I could get that again
it's just addicting.
Ah, once you get inside, you never want to get out.
Wow...that's amazing.
Oh yeah man, nothing like it.
Okay, so that aside, well, I mean how many points would you get for getting tubed?
Like what does it depend on for the contest?
Points?!
What?
Do you know who you sound like right now?
I promote happiness, can you see the happiness
emanating from me?  What's wrong with you?
You're live...
Oh good, good...
I have to say I have no doubt that this years Big Z Memorial
is just going to be just the best ever.
With the competition just 1 day away
the excitement is definitely building here on Pen Gu Island.
Ah...that didn't take too long, I feel lightheaded.
So get this, on my search for Cody
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.
Oh, I get it, you guys look hungry
yeah, yeah, yeah, you probably got the munchies or something.
Uno momento...
Squidiko, on el stickito?
Hmm? Hmm?
Check it out...dude, dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
You know, he's kind of like a penguin umm...
Hey guys, how did you learn how to surf?
I saw Big Z do it, actually.
I don't think you were born yet.
I wasn't?
No, I don't think so.
Lani...I like her when she teaches us
because she...
Muys...not another one!
I think he really has to go to the bathroom right now.
Okay, so what's next? The board's done what are we doing?
Board's done?
Board's done.
Oh, well uh, let's do some training, what do you say?
Finally!
Hey, can we get a shot of you on your surfboard...
Hey Z come on!
Where are you going?
I thought you said we were going to train.
Not in the water!  Geez, what are thinking?
You want to surf like, uh Big Z used to, right?
Yeah.
I've got some tests here to figure out your potential.
Let's do it.
No, no, no...put them on your eyes.
Like this...yeah.
Dig it Cody.
Can we do some training like, seriously, please?
What are you talking about, what do you think we're doing?
We're acting like a bunch of nut jobs, that's what I think we're doing.
Good, good you're learning.
Ahhh!
And a big set comes in!
Ha, ha, ha...wipe out!
This is getting ridiculous...
You having fun?
I hate you.
There's a big flow...woo hoo...and he does a flip over the top.
Alright, now you go.
No joy man, no joy.
Fail.
...I'm starting to see it now...
Z, I think I know what you're talking about...
Oh, that's great...as long as we're all having fun, right?
Z wake up, wake up Z.
Zeeeeeeeee!
Hey Z, breakfast!
Not a chance!
You'll have to get up earlier in the morning.
That is fun!
Oh, you're having fun, huh?
I am yes, now I am.
Oh, well then, Cody...you pass!
What?
You did it, you're ready, let's surf! Come on!
Z, don't play with me Z...we're surfing?!
Yes!
Hey, I didn't know you could surf!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Relax...long, slow, smooth...
Like making the board!
There you go.
Alright, okay...
Yeah?
Yeah!
You're in the water Z!
Yeah, come on out...get wet, come on!
Lani...thank you.
Woooooo!
Look at that!
Woooooo!
Nice! That's it!
Great run!
Big Z is back!
Wooooo!
Woo hoo!
Ah, this is what it's all about.
What could be better than this?
It's impossible to be down...
Ah, geez...
...when you're playing a uuuuuuuuuu...
...I need some help on this Lani for the high note...
Yeah! Nice!
Is that the only song that you know?
Pretty much, you want to hear it again?
No! No, no, no...
No, okay...
Got you though, didn't I, didn't I, huh?
I must say you were quite amazing out there today.
You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
Thanks to this guy.
Nah, I just pointed you in a direction.
Question, Z...
Hmmm...you changed your mind about the song...
No, no, no...
It goes something like this...
No, no, no...I was wondering if you'd come watch me ride tomorrow?
In the contest...
Contest...what contest?
The Big Z Memorial...remember that one?
I know, I know I'm asking a lot but it would really really be
the biggest thing in the world to me if you could come, I mean...
You still want to be a part of all that, huh?
Absolutely.
What do you want me there for anyway?
I don't know, I thought maybe you'd want to be there
I mean, I don't know why it's a big deal.
It's no big deal.
Why won't you come?
I'm not coming.
Why?
Just give it a rest, will ya?
...it's getting cold guys...
Can you tell me why you're hiding?
Hiding?
Why are you hiding?
...I'm going to have to eat all this by myself...
Why didn't you come back after you fell off the wave?
That wave...
that last day, the winning had become everything to me
I knew I was going to beat Tank.
But, then, you know, uh he starts to surf circles around me.
I saw what he was doing, I couldn't do what he was doing.
Times had changed, you know he...
I didn't want to walk back on that beach with all my fans there
you know, loser, everyone looking at Big Z
the loser, the has been.
So...
Poof! Big Z's dead, and that's how it's going to stay.
Let me play you that song...
What about never give up?
What about find a way?
Yeah, well...
You're giving up Z, you're giving up.
Yeah, I'm giving up, that's my way.
Giving up.
I thought you were the one guy...
You don't like it, find your own way.
Leave me out of it.
Leave me out of it.
Z !!!
I messed up, I'm just, I'm not good
this is when I needed someone, I needed him
you know, it's hard enough losing one Dad, but...
What do you mean by that?
Nothing...
Nothing man...forget it.
Whoa!!!!
Peace, peace, I come in peace!
Cody!
Joe!
I've been looking everywhere for you!
Really? You've been looking for me?
Dude, I didn't lose you on the whale, I'm not going to lose you now.
Thank you, seriously, thank you.
Radical.
Oh! They're starting, Cody we gotta go, come on.
Joe?  Joe?
Oh, I'm sorry...watch this dude, I can speak their language...
Mondo, Koodo, Poongoo
Ahhh!
Dude, I totally need my board, I don't even know where it is
I gotta go find it, I'll see you in the line up then...
See you Joe...
The 10th annual Big Z is about to get under way
and whoa, it is the day of days.
Big mountainous bombs marching into our coastline
Kelli Slater, on a danger level, 1 to 10, give me a number.
Wow, Rob?
Oh, there'll be blood.
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!
What are you doing here?
Mike...
You're going to kill yourself, please don't do this to yourself, please
look what happened last time, look...
Hey, hey, hey!
It's good to see you back.
Are you serious?
You know, you're going to be a real crowd pleaser
I'm telling ya, these people are going to eat you up.
I'll be expecting big things from you.
Thank you.
Hey people, big announcement, Cody Maverick, he's back
the wipe out king is back and I'm going to tell ya
start looking for the sharks, they're going to be circling
'cause there's going to be blood in the water.
Spectacular carnage today, thank you Reggie Bellafonte
hey, little guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart...come on.
Whoa, look at this, you're going down snowflake.
I'm going to make you wish you were never even hatched.
You want to see my trophies?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Arnold...no.
There's about 24 surfers battling there way out to the...
Ewww...good golly, make that 18
Ralph, after such a heavy wipe out earlier in the week
what do you think is going through Maverick's mind?
He's just going to have to stay focused and channel that energy to good places.
When are you going to get a life?
You are a nobody.
You should have stayed in Antartica, kid.
Cody, Cody, Cody!!!
Wooo!
Hey, he made it!
What an amazing first run, mindblowing for Maverick.
Did you guys see that?  Oh man, I thought I was going to lose it
then I just, I just let go you know, I let go and there it was.
Wow, it's been an amazing day of shredding in less than stellar conditions
but I never would have guessed our 3 finalists.
Well, Sal, it's no surprise that Tank Evans has just breezed his way into the finals.
And, Cody Maverick, from a horrible wipe out a few days ago to this.
And Chicken Joe from Shaboygan, who would have guessed it?
I have never seen a finals like this.
We're in the finals, Joe.
No way, we get to surf some more?
Isn't it exciting?
Yeah.
Look at that, ha, ha, this is great, huh?
Hey, you know, you should know this, Tank loves you.
Looks like this will be the easiest year ever.
No way, Cody did you hear that?
This is going to be easy.
Are you loving this?!
So who would you like to see win the trophy?
It's not so important to me...friends are better than anything in the world.
Friends are forever, trophies, you never know what could happen to them.
That was awesome...
Thank you man, thank you bro'.
Wow, finally...
Hey, yeah, no, I know, I can't even...
I know I think I could win this thing.
It's just, it's too much right now.
Yeah, well, that's all you came for.
What?
What was that supposed to mean?
Uh, you made it pretty clear last night that winning's
more important to you than Z or me.
Lani, that's not...
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take your stupid trophy home.
Lani...come on!
Come here, you.
How 'bout this, huh?  Let me tell you something
you win this thing, you and me, we're going places, huh?
Hey, look at this kid...he is a champ.
Tank, 9 time defending champion...he will roll on you.
Expect him to win this thing Sal,
it's basically a contest for second place.
First I'm going to take you down
then I'm going to fry the chicken.
That cloud looks just like kitten, ahh.
Maverick and Evans take off...
and it's Evans dropping in.
Tank's game plan...rocking Maverick's every move
and Evans takes a rail.
Tank Evans down, I have never, ever seen this before!
But I would love to see it again.
Cody trying to take back the wave that Tank snaked from him.
Evans toying with him not paying attention and there's the outside rail!
Evans goes down and it's Maverick with this new school move!
We'll call it The Maverick.
And look at this, Maverick's scoring big.
It's so cute, it's got the little paws, the whiskers...whoa
Chicken Joe with a no paddle drop in...
nobody needs to help this chicken.
Woo hoo, I'm flying!
Maverick and Joe, tied
and no score for Tank Evans...unbelievable.
Surfers, this is your final wave.
Yo man, this is it, this wave wins it, huh?!
Yeah man!
This wave is stacking up to be a beautiful tube
Maverick should score big on this one.
Wait! Evans drops in
looks like Evans is going to take out the chicken.
What's Maverick doing?
Go Joe, Go!
Got it!
I don't believe this, this contest was Maverick's to win
and now Evans pushing Maverick out of bounds
and into the boneyards.
Hey! Look out!
You look out!
Hey!
Z !
Cody, come on.
Z !
Paddle, come on...dig faster, come on...dig, dig!
Don't dig, don't dig.

You're going to have to time it.
You're going to come right here, right to me.
Z !
Wh...Where's Cody?
Don't touch it, don't touch that
this is a reminder of the young surfer
who gave his life for the sport he loved.
Ah, there you are...
I can't believe it!
You came back, you save my life man.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey c'mon, c'mon...you're going to tip us.
Well...I lost.
Ah, me too.
Come on, let's go loser.
You want to help me out here?
You know the routine...

Young Joey Macinroe was a beacon for a new generation

So...we're bidding for the board, who will give me $30, $30, come on.
Don't touch his stuff, man.
Hey, hey, hey...

Hey, hey check it out, how about this...
you want to talk about talent scout, people find talent
I bring them back from the dead!
The now living legend, ladies and...
Reggie, shut...shutup.
What? Shutup?
I'm not a legend, I'm just a guy looking for some nice waves
and good friends.
Ow...
Hey guys, swell's happening over on the north shore.
I'm right behind ya, Z.
Ouch, that hurt.
Hey, come back here, you don't walk away, come on!
Folks, it looks like he's taking this loss pretty hard.
Tank, how's it feel to lose after 9 times...
I wasn't kissing her...
you can't have her!
Guys, guys can we get a few words?
Hey Ralph.
So you gave up the trophy to help Joe man...
what's that about?
Well, you Rob, that's uh, what friends do.
How's it feel to win Joe?
I won?
Come on...I'm going to tell my Mom!
Oops.
Don't you walk away from me
I am Reggie Bellafonte...
turn that thing off.
Mikey you are so fired!
I can't imagine a better day!
Dude...I mean, this whole experience has just been,
it's amazing.
Z? I don't think I've ever had a better friend to me
in my life.
It's just really cool to have everything I need.
Don't do it!
Help!
Oh, Arnold!
You know, honestly, I'm like kind of bored of talking about myself
so is that cool?
You guys got what you need?
Yeah, yeah...we got it.
Heyyyyy!
Cowabunga!
Oh, of course we're proud of him, what Mother wouldn't be proud?
We're so full of proudness...
You know what, he followed his dream and he went out there
and now he's coming home with the trophy.
I mean, I can't wait to see the trophy!
Well, there's not really a trophy...
Oh, is there like a big shell or something?
No shell, there's no trophy...well he didn't, he didn't win.
What?
How bad, how bad was it?
I mean did he get smoked?
He was in the finals...he was in the finals.
Second place, yeah...that's losing.
Winning is not everything Glen.
I mean, look at, look at what Cody did.
Wait, wait go back to the winning isn't everything thing.
That doesn't compute, really.
You know what Glen?
I really hope that someday you can be more like Cody.
This interview's over.
