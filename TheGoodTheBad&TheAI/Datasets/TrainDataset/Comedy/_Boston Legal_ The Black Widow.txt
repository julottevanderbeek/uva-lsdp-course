You know, they can never tell
whether I know what I'm doing or not.
- Can you tell?
- Not really.
- We have a reputation here
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
-
The attorneys here take great pride
in that reputation.
It undermines everyone
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt--
- Stop it!
- So you're Shirley Schmidt of Crane, Poole &--
- Schmidt.
- Alan Shore. It's a pleasure.
- Denny Crane.
- Oh!
I once had a torrid,
torrid affair with that woman.
- First, everybody knows that.
- Second, the word would be ''horrid.''
You don't know me, Alan Shore,
not as well as you think.
- How are you?
- You killed again!
You got blood on my hands that will
never come out. Friends don't do that.!
Do not start a war with me here!
You may not win it!
- We look good together.
- Yes, we do.
And now,
the season premiere of Boston Legal.
- Denny, we look good, right?
- We look great.
- Did she say what kind of case?
- Wrongful termination.
The employer was trying to enforce
his religion or something.
- The plaintiff quit and sued.
- And it's going to trial?
You have to get me in to meet her.
You simply must.
- How did you even know she was here?
- Don't be ridiculous.
There's a Web site that tracks her
as sure as I am little.
- If I could just get a peek, a little whiff.
-
- Why are you here, Bernard?
- Well, never mind me.
The Black Widow is here.
She's in your office as we speak...
as sure as I am little.
- The woman who murdered her husband?
- You make it sound so ordinary.
It was the way she did it.
They were concubining.
She's in there with Brad.
Evidently, she fired her last lawyer.
And for whatever reason,
she wants you.
- Denny, the conference call
with Jack Meyers has begun--
- You take it.
- The Black Widow is here.
- I can't take it. I'm in a meeting.
Which means that you have to take it.
And since this man pays us over
two million dollars a year--
Not everything is about money, Shirley.
Sometimes, sex counts too.
It used to count with you. One minute,
you couldn't get enough of me.
The next, you lose interest.
What happened, Shirley? I need to know.
They invented color television.
You and me, in my office.
Give me two minutes.
If you could last three,
I might consider it.
- In the meantime,Jack Meyers--
- Not now.
The Black Widow gets me first.
I'm not saying that
we can't win, Walter.
I'm saying it's not likely
and that we should settle.
It's my company, Denise, and I'm tired
of apologizing for my faith.
You can't have the Bible be
assigned reading in the workplace.
-
- Denny Crane.
You've come to the right firm.
I can tell you that--
My God. You're even
more striking in person.
Who is this man,
and why is his face about to explode?
Kelly Nolan, this is Denny Crane.
Success has caused his head to swell.
It'll be an honor to defend your honor.
Has anybody ever told you
how incredibly beautiful you are?
Never. Could you excuse us, please?
Certainly you'd want me
by your side at this trial.
I'm sure you're very sweet,
but old men tend to die on me.
I'm Denny Crane.
No bigger ass-- asset.
- You want me at your table.
- Look, we're sort of busy here.
Seems like you're deliberately
challenging us to dislike you.
Mr. Shore, the media has
painted me as the ''Black Widow''...
the gold digger who's poisoned
her 70-year-old rich husband.
If they can prove I was having
an affair, I'll be hated.
I'll be needing a jury to look beyond
the hatred and see that I'm innocent.
I suppose I'm first looking for
an attorney who could do the same.
I can. My God, you're sexy.
How about you
go back to your office?
I'll have a pair
of my pants delivered.
- You can try and get in them on your own time.
- She's wicked.
I love it.
-
-
I think we can agree,
the last thing you need...
is to be depicted in open court
as a sexual predator.
I've already been vilified
as such, Shirley.
Court represents my only means
to clear my name.
Adam, while we may win this trial...
we don't have the means
to prove your innocence.
If I settle this,
people will presume guilt.
More importantly,
my colleagues will.
I'm a respected surgeon,
for God's sake.
I don't jump out of alleys
to fondle people.
Look, the district attorney
refused even to bring charges.
That tells you how ridiculous
this whole thing is.
There's a higher burden of proof
in criminal cases. This is civil.
All she needs to establish
is a preponderance of evidence.
- If she's convincing in her testimony--
- How can she be?
- The woman is mute.
- I beg your pardon?
The plaintiff can't speak.
She's mute.
- It's in the file.
- So it's my word...
my truthful word,
against her lying affidavit.
Opposing counsel is
coming in this afternoon.
- If I can make this go away--
- She has to walk away. I'm not giving her a dime.
- He knew about your affair?
- Yes.
The only rule he had
was for me to be discreet.
Which you weren't.
And your boyfriend Justin--
- Ex-boyfriend. We're no longer together.
- Mmm.
- That pleases you?
- It does.
Why don't you talk to him?
I'll pay a visit to the housekeeper.
- And, Denny--
- I'll look after Kelly.
I can see you're aroused.
You might consider the last man
to make love to her died while doing so.
I'll take my chances.
You two will sit at the table, offer
the appearance of a formidable defense team...
thereby suggesting that Walter Edmunds
has this firm's full resources at his disposal.
Garrett, plaintiff's
interrogatory responses.
Review them.
Know them before the deposition.
Sara, I want you to research
whether or not...
a civil rights claim can even
exist absent state action.
- Oh, I'll need your memo by noon.
- Mr. Lewiston has me on the Shepard closing.
Right. Now you're off it. Go.
I'll talk to Mr. Lewiston.
Denise?
- Tim.
- You, uh--You got a second?
Actually, no. Is it important?
- Well, um--
- What?
I didn't want to have
a process server deliver--
I thought I should at least, um--
You're filing for divorce?
Well, it's not something we both didn't,
you know, expect.
I just-- Look, as a courtesy--
- You wanted to see my expression?
- It wasn't that. Denise--
It's fine.
I appreciate the courtesy.
Look. Look, we both--
I'm really busy, Tim.
We'll talk about this later, okay?
Sure. Yeah.
I'll expect you to know every one
of those interrogatories by 1 :00 p.m.
We could argue that her complaint gives
rise to a defamation claim against her.
I doubt that would fly.
Sorry I'm late, people.
Extraordinary thing, that Big Dig.
Malcolm Holmes, Tara--
What?
Tara and I are, um, already acquainted.
- Acquainted?
- Well, that's what we say in England.
In America, you'd probably say...
I'm the reason
she went to law school.
- She's the one who got away.
- What are you doing in Boston?
I finally know.
You let your hair grow.
I hate to break up the tea party, but--
Careful. We're still a bit thin-skinned
on that one. Such a waste of proper tea.
How is it that I just get older
and you seem to get more... magnificent?
How about first,
we address settling the case?
Ah. I have no interest in settling.
We fully intend to see this through.
- Well, you do so at your own peril.
- Do I?
Once we establish your client's claim
as baseless, our client has instructed us...
to pursue a defamation claim
against Miss Bradley.
Suddenly, her house could be in play.
- I'm not sure we want that.
- Very impressive.
You might advise her
of that as well.
You have an opposing counsel who will stop
at nothing to impress an old boyfriend.
Given that I don't believe in coincidences...
I'd like to take this opportunity to say
what's needed to be said for some time.
We...
have no intention of settling.
Here's the motion.
I'll see you both in court.
It was extremely pro-Christian.
There were Bible sessions, Christian hymns.
As a Jew, I found it increasingly
more and more oppressive.
- So you quit?
- It was more like I was forced out.
The office took on
such a Christian tone.
- So you quit?
- I felt ostracized as a Jew.
Alienated. I was forced out.
I have manyJewish friends
who miss going to morning shul...
so they've started forming minyans
at the office during their lunch hour.
- Are you saying that that's wrong?
- There's a difference.
- Tell me the difference, Mr. Abrams.
-Jews are a minority.
And minorities enjoy civil rights
that the majority doesn't?
When we talk about the rights
of minorities in this country...
we're addressing
the evil of oppression.
When you say to a Christian society that
it's okay to start celebrating your religion...
openly and notoriously
in the workplace...
you run the risk of fostering
that very oppression.
- I began to feel oppressed.
- So you just quit the marriage?
The job.
I've worked
in this household for 3 7 years.
I was the closest thing that man
had to family for the last 1 0...
and that includes her.
By her, you mean Kelly Nolan?
The way she treated him, parading
her boyfriend around in the house--
If I may ask, how is it that...
you still live here
and Kelly Nolan doesn't?
I mean, it is her house, isn't it?
She says it brings her
too much pain to live here.
The memory of her husband
dying in her arms.
I guess the memory of lacing
his wine with nitro isn't as haunting.
What makes you think she did that?
I know he wasn't suicidal.
I know she stood to inherit. I know they argued,
and he threatened to disinherit her.
She certainly knew he'd be taking Viagra
if they were going to make love...
which they almost never did,
by the way.
Perfect. Slip him a little nitro.
What a deadly combination.
You seem to have a finely-tuned
sense of delivery.
Having lived in the same house
with her for seven years...
I know she's a cold,
detached... person.
She's capable.
- She's lying. He never
threatened to disinherit me.
- Why would she say that?
I don't know. He never threatened
to cut me out of the will.
If she says that she heard as much
two days before he died--
And let me tell you, the housekeeper
has considerable dramatic flare.
- We cannot let that woman take the stand.
- How do we stop it?
- Bring a motion in limine. It's hearsay.
- My last lawyer tried that.
Well, we try again. Frances Stadler
cannot get in that witness chair.
- There they are!
-
Denny Crane. She loves me.
She loves me not.
Denny Crane.
It's a last-minute motion
designed to waste the court's time.
A week before the trial,
I have no interest in wasting time.
Mr. Shore, all motions were to be filed
Now, I must admit that I am new
to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...
but I like to stick to my schedules.
Of course. Why bother with justice
when there's a day planner involved?
I realize attorneys in Massachusetts
are fond of sarcasm.
You should know I spent most of
my years on the bench in Los Angeles.
And if a lawyer talks back
to a judge in Los Angeles--
He's shot, probably on the freeway.
Can we get back to the justice part?
Justice is not served by preventing
a material witness from testifying.
It's hearsay evidence.
The only thing the housekeeper has to offer
would be what the deceased told her.
As to what the deceased
told Mrs. Stadler...
these were statements made in an excited
state, an exception to the hearsay rule.
- How can you establish that?
- She will establish that on the stand.
- Which brings us to her bias.
- The court is allowing the testimony.
Your Honor, this is a murder case.
We once had a notion in this country
that the rules of evidence...
would be strictly constructed
and interpreted in favor of the defendant.
There's a reason for that. It's to protect
against the incarceration of the innocent.
- There sits an innocent woman.
-  I have made my ruling, counsel.
Miss Stadler may testify.
We are adjourned. That's all.
Sorry. Hug?
- A cello?
- Your Honor, my client is
entitled to her day in court.
- And how are we supposed to understand
what she's saying?
- We have her affidavits.
Plus, as it happens, I speak cello.
Mr. Holmes,
this is a serious matter.
I assure you, I find nothing humorous
about a sexual assault.
And you don't think
it's trivialized...
by putting her up there
with a musical instrument?
My client is mute.
That should not prevent her...
from getting in the witness chair
and expressing herself to her best ability.
Miss Schmidt, I don't see
how it prejudices anything.
- You're not serious?
- We'll begin tomorrow morning, 1 0:00.
- We're adjourned.
-
Oh, um, a few
small administrative matters.
Are you involved?
Tell me over dinner. Not to worry.
She won't give you away,
you naughty man.
I began to notice
that many of our employees...
were engaged in
borderline unethical conduct...
be it nondisclosure,
conflict of interest.
I didn't like it. Add to that...
there seemed to be evidence
of some moral decay.
- Moral decay?
- Yes.
There was adultery
going on interoffice.
Therejust seemed to be
a bankruptcy of values, if you will.
And we ultimately came
to the conclusion that...
people aren't bringing their spirituality
to work with them.
So you scheduled interoffice prayer sessions
in a financial brokerage firm?
It had nothing to do with pushing
any specific religious agenda.
- Did you discuss this with in-house counsel?
- Of course.
- What did they say?
- Well, they said that there
were some risks involved.
- But I felt strongly enough--
- Objection. That's privileged. Do not answer.
I believe he began answering
the question, thereby waiving privilege.
The witness will not answer
the question.
Your role was to sit at the table.
It was not to speak...
it was not to object, and it was
not to issue directives to the client.
I thought he was about to reveal
privileged information.
I will decide whether to object or not.
Do you understand me?
- You weren't listening.
- What did you say?
I-- I saw your face.
You weren't even paying attention.
- That's why I jumped in.
- Is that how you practice law?
You read faces? Garrett,
it would be a mistake to try to read mine.
It won't happen again.
Garrett.
I apologize.
You were right to object.
I was asleep at the wheel.
And I'm out ofline
to be venting on you.
It's okay.
Obviously, I overheard--
with your husband.
My husband and I
were over a long time ago.
But with his filing, I--
I just don't like to fail at things.
Again, I shouldn't be taking it out on you.
I apologize.
- So what comes next?
- I-I beg your pardon?
In the case. What comes next?
We have a settlement conference
scheduled during which...
I need to make a convincing showing as to
why they should accept a small number.
But what that showing is escapes me.
I have no idea.
What do you think you're doing?
I just--
You looked-- I'm sorry.
I realize that men see a vulnerable woman
as an opportunity.
- I guess the boys do as well.
- It wasn't that, I promise.
I was just offering consolation.
Thank you. I'm fine.
Okay.
Well, good-bye then.
- I didn't kill my husband.
- Somebody killed him, Kelly.
Accidental overdose
will be very hard to sell.
The capsule was emptied
into the wine glass.
Who takes nitro that way?
Somebody killed him.
Why aren't you pointing a finger?
- Or at least asking questions?
- I think he took his own life.
By inducing a heart attack?
There's got to be a more fun way.
I think he wanted to frame me.
We argued about my affair.
He vowed to get even.
I think he did.
It's like she's
emotionally flatlined.
She speaks with no affect.
It's-It's-It's an associative disorder.
That's what it is. She cannot
reconcile herself with what she's done...
so she emotionally
lobotomizes herself.
If I could just
get one whiff of her--
Catherine, mark up a motion for a continuance
in the Nolan case and file it immediately.
Ah! I knew it! You need more time.
You're in trouble!
She did it, didn't she?
He seems to take particular delight
in all this, does he not, Catherine?
We all do.
It's fun to see pretty people fall.
Your little boyfriend is twisted.
Trust me when I tell you
he's not finished killing.
- Would I like him?
- Probably not.
You'd admire his sense of humor.
- Do you see you two getting married?
- Probably not.
You see us two getting married?
Probably not.
This is why I shouldn't drink, I suppose.
Double scotch, please.
Yes, sir.
- You know, your client is guilty.
- Says you.
Concert cellists don't lie.
Come on.
One kiss, hmm?
Let's get it over with.
I'll see you in court, Malcolm.
Indeed.
How dare you come in here
and seek a continuance!
Your Honor, we need
to conduct an investigation...
having incorrectly assumed
that the police had done one.
Mr. Shore, this-this woman
is trying to manipulate this process.
- I will not be manipulated.
- Mad cow.
Silence!
She likely fired her last attorney
because she told him she did it.
And since he can't knowingly put a witness
in the chair to commit perjury...
which is her plan, she was forced to retain
new counsel and keep them in the dark.
And now, we have you... and you.
If this woman wishes
to manipulate me in the dark--
- Denny.
- Silence!
- The eyes.
- Quiet!
This trial will start next week.
Judge, notwithstanding
your tightly-corseted mind...
no defendant in a murder case
can get a fair trial...
with an attorney who has had
less than a week to prepare.
You're wasting my time, counsel.
And to the detriment of Miss Nolan,
you are wasting yours.
Your request for
a continuance is denied.
- You think she's hot for you?
- I didn't say hot. I said interested.
- You're delusional.
- First of all, she made it a point to tell me...
how she was long over her husband.
- What does that--
- And second, she gave me the look.
- What look?
- The look that you can't describe
but you know when you get it.
- Get what?
- The look.
Two associates huddled?
Someone better be getting billed.
Settlement conference is at 4:00.
No talking.
Now, Miss Bradley...
I am armed with your affidavit,
and the judge has permitted me to lead.
But in your own way...
I'd like you to tell us
what happened that night.
You were headed home.
It was a delightful spring night.
Parents walking with their children.
It seemed so innocent, blissful...
which is perhaps the reason
why you felt safe...
in taking a shortcut
through an alleyway.
It was dark. Suddenly--
-
- you had a very strange feeling.
- You turned around. Looked around!
-
And suddenly, a man was coming.
That man! And he grabbed you.
You were terrified.
He molested you. He fondled your breast.
It was awful.
You will never get over it, ever.
Thank you. Your witness.
- Objection!
- Miss Bradley!
Miss Bradley, you said that
it was dark that night...
- did you not?
-
- He came at you from the side?
-
You said that the entire incident...
- took place in five seconds, did you not?
-
All five seconds in the dark?
-
- Did you ever see him totally from the front?
Thank you.
Miss Bradley!
Blow that one up. No, that one.
Blow it up.
She's perfect.
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- What's going on?
- Nothing, dear.
We were just looking
at naked pictures...
of your client fornicating
in her swimming pool.
- Okay, everyone out, please.
- Yes. Everyone out, now!
Out! Terrible. Now!
Out!
Problem. You got a Web site, Kelly.
What do you mean?
Would this beJustin Murray?
- Where did these come from?
-  Point is, they're everywhere now.
- They were posted this morning.
- Can we trace the source?
- I doubt it. We could try, but--
- I think I know who took these.
There's a person, a boy in my neighborhood.
Fifteen, 1 6.
Willis Berger. At times,
I thought he was stalking me.
- Stalking you?
- I'd be at the salon, and I'd see him in the window.
I would be shopping.
He'd show up at the market.
We briefly hired him to do
some odd jobs around the house...
until we had to fire him
because he was just too bizarre.
Do you know where
this Willis Berger lives?
Yes.
I'm gonna mark up a motion
to change venue.
If those images reach
ourjury pool, it'll kill us.
Why don't you pay a visit
to this Willis Berger, see what's there.
We could try for a search
with a court order.
I don't think we've got enough
to get one.
Brad, I need for you
to use your imagination here.
Get your hands dirty if you have to.
Let me start by mussing up--
Oh, good God. It doesn't muss.
Get what you can on this kid.
Look at me, Kelly.
This may be a break.
Disgusting.
I was out for a walk.
It was a beautiful spring evening.
I went for a walk.
Suddenly, police cars screech up.
They grab me, haul me into a lineup.
She points her cello wand at me.
And now, here I am on trial
for something I never did.
You never encountered this woman?
- Certainly not!
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Holmes?
- Oh. Yeah, sorry.
Such a beautiful woman,
your attorney.
It is quite difficult to work
in such close proximity...
without wanting to give her
a little squeeze.
-  Objection!
- Sustained.
Now, tell me, Doctor...
how old were you
when you started playing doctor?
-  Objection!
- Sustained. Move for costs.
Mr. Holmes,just for fun,
let me sustain or overrule the objections.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
So, Doctor, you said you were out
taking a walk that night.
- Yes.
- Sir, when you were picked up by police...
that was almost
three miles from where you live.
Were you deliberately walking in an area far away
from where you live so as to avoid suspicion?
I don't understand his strategy.
He seems to be trivializing
his whole case with this nonsense.
What's his plan here?
His style is to get the jury to like him,
which they always do.
- And they usually give him what he asks for.
- How do I rattle him?
- Malcolm Holmes doesn't rattle.
- Oh, come on, Tara.
You slept with the man.
You've got to give me some insight.
Slept with what man?
Oh.
Opposing counsel is
someone I used to date.
- I thought I told you.
- I think you didn't.
Really? Probably because
he's an old boyfriend...
who didn't mean anything then,
and still doesn't.
I thought I told you.
I think you didn't.
Laurie Berger?
- Yes?
- Do you have a son, Willis Berger?
- What's wrong? What's happened?
- I'm investigating a potential crime.
If I had the authority to reveal
it was with the F.B.I., I would say so.
But until certain security
clearances are satisfied...
I'm not officially at liberty
to tell you anything.
As far as you're concerned,you never heard
me say I'm with the F.B.I., which I'm not.
I need to speak
with your son immediately...
and I think you would like to arrange that
before others speak with him.
- I'm sure you know what I mean.
- What's he done?
Take me to your son, ma'am.
Hello, Willis. I'm not F.B.I. You got that?
You never heard me say F.B.I.
Do any blogging today?
Get away from the computer.
- Why?
- Step away from the computer, son.
- I-I was just looking.
- Looking, or posting?
- Willis!
- I was just lookin'.
- That's your neighbor Kelly Nolan.
- So?
That's why I'd be curious, right?
Naked pictures of a neighbor on a Web site?
Who wouldn't look?
Mm-hmm. What's that there?
Where did you get those, Willis?
First of all,
he wasn't forced to participate.
If the whole office is reading
the Book of Genesis, then--
- He chose to quit.
- Forced out.
- Found other employment.
- Less money. Come on, Denise.
Do you really wanna let a jury have
a go at this? Oppression is a dirty word.
Remember, we're the country
that likes to root it out.
This isn't the time to be anti-American.
Do I really need to say that?
This isn't the time to be anti-American.
Do I really need to say that?
Actually, the American government...
tells us to be quite open with our religion,
especially the Christian kind.
- Does it now?
-Jimmy Carter was a born-again Christian.
Ronald Reagan said
his favorite book was the Bible.
May I?
- May I?
- Please.
- We are guided by a power larger than ourselves.
-Jesus Christ, the son of God.
We worship an awesome God.
- I just want to do God's will.
- We are on God's side.
- When you turn your heart and your life--
- I say a prayer before I pitch.
over to Christ--
- God knows the truth--
- when you accept Christ--
- in a man's heart--
- it changes your heart.
What does the Lord require of thee?
- My friends, together we can do this.
-  And to walk--
- Do it we must.
- humbly--
- So help me God.
- with thy God.
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.
- Whoops.
- How is this relevant?
It's relevant because...
the open, notorious celebration of
Christianity has never been more popular.
We have an evangelical president.
John Ashcroft was a former preacher.
Condoleezza Rice
was once a Bible teacher.
The Air Force Academy
has basically established...
evangelical Christianity
as its official religion.
The football coach there put up a banner
that says, ''Team Jesus Christ.''
Have you checked the
pulse of this country lately?
- How is this relevant?
- I just told you.
It's evolution out, creationism in.
We are a Christian nation.
He's making me repeat myself.
With the eroding values in our country,
with high school kids turning to drugs...
not to mention oral sex, with
our star athletes doped up on steroids...
or committing sexual assaults, with the Enrons
and WorldComs stealing from their investors...
what is wrong with today's
business leaders trying to introduce...
a little spirituality
into the workplace?
- One nation under God.
- One nation under God.
- One standard under God.
- One people under God.
- For the children of God.
- The Lord is my life!
- I have, uh, accepted Christ.
- God.
- Praise to my lord and savior.
- God.
- Jesus Christ.
- And ChristJesus.
- With God--
- God--
- Through Christ--
- God bless--
- Christ.
- God.
-Jesus.

- I did not have sexual--
We are a Christian nation, Mr. Cone.
When Martin Luther King said,
''Free at last''..
it was,
''God almighty, free at last.''
This is who we are.
We are a Christian nation. And this--
this is our time.
- I can't believe you did that.
- It just came to me.
She almost fired you for objecting
at the depo, and then you filibust--
- I didn't filibust. I was only--
- Garrett?
After I specifically
told you not to talk...
what would possibly possess you
to put on a show-and-tell like that?
Sometimes,
you have to take chances...
in life, in law, in love.
Incredibly, you had some effect.
The plaintiff is reconsidering
another counter.
- And with you.
- I'm sorry?
You're a senior associate.
Satisfying you is important to me as well.
- No comment.
- Denny Crane.
She's having my baby. Denny Crane.
- A change of venue?
- These images are graphic.
They're all over the Internet.
I'm sure you've seen them,Judge.
The potential jury pool would be contaminated--
- Mr. Shore, I'm not happy.
- Gee. And up till now, you've seemed so tickled.
This is dilatory.
That's what this is.
Your Honor, this woman
is entitled to a fair trial.
She's entitled to bejudged
by objectivejurors--
If these images are on the Internet,
they probably wouldn't be limited...
to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
and you know that, sir.
Your Honor, at this time,
I must ask that you recuse yourself.
- On what grounds?
- Because you're the real killer
and everybody knows it.
-
- Step up here, counsel!
You have misstepped,
and you are egregiously mistaken...
if you think you will insult
this court without consequence.
And you are mistaken if you think
you're going to push me around.
I hated bullies on the playground
when I was six.
I tolerate them no better on the bench
in my 40s. This is a murder trial.
I've got the whole world
predisposed against my client.
I will not allow the presiding judge
to be added to that list.
- I am a fair and impartial jurist.
- Then start acting like one.
You are in contempt.
So as not to prejudice your case or client,
I will suspend punishment.
As soon as this trial concludes,
you're going into lockup.
In the meantime, your motion
for a change of venue is denied.
It may be too late
to get another lawyer.
Maybe not, though.
Obviously, I haven't exactly
hit it off with this judge.
Perhaps you should go elsewhere.
I'll stay.
- I think you know.
- I know?
That I'm innocent.
The way you fought in there.
Don't kid yourself.
I'm the ultimate mercenary.
I put myself on the line
for $500 an hour.
It's that simple.
I don't believe you.
You know.
In the matter of Bradley versus Carter...
on the count of sexual battery...
we find in favor of... the defendant.
- Yes.
- Oh, bollocks!
- Do over,Judge?
- You can try your luck with
the appeals court, counsel.
We're adjourned.
- Thank God.
- Congratulations, Adam. You stuck to your guns.
Thank you. Thank you, Tara.
You're perfectly welcome.
- Everything okay?
- Fine.
Well, loser has to jump the net.
So I suppose dinner's on me.
I am not having dinner with you.
- Tara?
- See you tomorrow.
I'm, uh, not one to offer advice...
but if you're really serious about this, um,
Alan fellow, you don't want to lose him...
at least, by God,
be able to offer the excuse...
that you simply had
too much wine for dinner.
- Hmm?
- Excuse for what?
Excellent. I love a woman
who makes no apologies.
- Let's go.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
No? Then why is your hand in mine?
I'll have dinner.
That's it.
Of course.
That was quite something
with the judge today, Alan.
Yes, it was.
Dream case, isn't it?
High-profile, splashy.
Big closing. Get the ''not guilty. ''
Have sex with the client.
It's all there.
Hmm. Do you think she knows
I wanna sleep with her?
She probably assumes all men do,
maybe even some of the women.
Mmm.
Savor it, my friend.
- Sorry?
- This case.
The noise, the jeers, the circus.
Savor it.
- She didn't do it.
- What?
She didn't kill her husband.
She's innocent.
Really?
Well, that's good.
Makes her less interesting...
but that's-- that's good.
It's also pressure, Denny.
We've got an innocent client.
This is gonna be a ride.
Yes, it is.
You stinker.!
