Although your diplomas
are equally specific, remember:
You are all going out
into the world as individuals.
I now proudly present
this year's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs
graduating class.
Go, go, go.
- Bye. We love you.
- You have to write.
- Thank your mom for all the cookies, OK?
- I'm very proud of you.
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.
Princess Mia.
Look out the window,
and welcome back to Genovia.
It's the princess from America! Hi.
Her Royal Highness Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi
has arrived.
Welcome home, Princess.
And her royal pussycat, Sir Fat Louie.
Countess Puck of Austria.
The queen is coming.
Here she comes. Look alive.
Places.
She'll have a double-door entrance.
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle is flying.
She's in the foyer.
Beautiful.
But you're late, Your Majesty.
A queen is never late.
Everyone else is simply early.
Of course.
Her Majesty
Clarisse Renaldi,
Queen of Genovia.
Greetings, good friends.
I am delighted
to welcome you here this evening.
- Thank you.
- I hope they have string cheese.
Ah, good.
Many of you will remember King Rupert's
and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.
King Rupert. May he rest in peace.
Will you please
raise your glasses in celebration
of Princess Mia's 21 st birthday.
Presenting Her Royal Highness
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,
Princess of Genovia.
To Princess Mia.
To Princess Mia.
- It happens all the time.
- Oh!
- And happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Oh, I don't speak Greek.
-
- And you obviously don't speak English.
-
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
- One, two...
- Ow!
Sorry.
- Have you met the princess yet?
- Briefly. But she wasn't very friendly.
I got a hello and a goodbye.
Is this an American custom?
- I saw that.
- Oh, uh...
Oh, I've missed you.
- Sebastian.
- Majesty.
- Sheila.
- Majesty.
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, just partying, girl. You know.
Oh, your foot. I'm so sorry. Are...
Are you all right?
I'll survive, Your Highness.
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.
Are you sure you don't want to
exchange licenses and proof of insurance?
No, no. These shoes
were a little big anyway.
The swelling should help them fit better.
Hey, get a load of this guy.
Shimmy shimmy.
Hey, hey, hey.
- You are a beautiful dancer.
- Oh, why, thank you so much.
Like a deer.
Or a chipmunk in the forest.
Looks like he's trying to land a plane.
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing to be compared to.
May I?
- Your timing is impeccable. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Your Highness.
Mia. I like to be called Mia.
And you are?
Nicholas. Just Nicholas.
Well, I'm very glad to see that my
clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.
You can step on my foot anytime.
Aww.
It is Prince Jacques' turn.
Your Highness.
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.
That's Prince Jacques.
He's about 12 years old.
He's a very precocious prince.
He wears aftershave
to make people think that he's older.
May I blow in your ear?
Can you reach it?
Princess, there's someone
from parliament you should meet.
Charlotte, how many
members of parliament are there?
Only two left, Your Highness.
- Cake, ladies?
- Oh, dear.
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me,
I am so sorry. It was only an accident.
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.
Thank you so much.
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.
Oh, I hope not.
But thank you so much for all your help.
Someone like me.
Hi. How's it going?
- So sorry, I thought I was alone.
- No, Miss.
I'm Brigitte, if it pleases you.
At your service.
- And I'm Brigitta, Miss.
- Brigitte and Brigitta, I'm Mia.
And, please, you don't...
Don't curtsy like that.
- Not like this? How do you like it, then?
- Like this, maybe?
No, no, no, I didn't mean, like, you know...
No, no, not that way. I didn't mean it, um...
The queen bids you good morning,
Princess. She's in session with parliament.
- OK.
- I see you've met your lady's maids.
Yeah. Um...
- How do you turn off the curtsies?
- Oh.
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at the throne room.
- OK.
- I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.
But you're welcome
to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?
- Of course.
-
Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.
Hey, Mo.
The throne room, in an hour.
The parliament of Genovia is in session.
Prime Minister Motaz presiding.
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.
As we all know, the 21 st birthday
of an heir to the Genovian bloodline
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.
It signifies that this young person
is eligible to assume the crown.
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.
Oh, wow.
King Chevalier
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...
Hello?
Ah... Oh.
Proceed.
Nice.
Hello?
So.
As of the 20th of October last year,
on the occasion of his 21 st birthday,
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.
What?
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.
I beg your pardon?
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say
that my nephew
is ready to take his place
as Genovia's rightful king.
Shut up.
I beg your pardon?
- I mean...
- "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow."
-
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?
Not yet.
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry
before she can take the throne.
We have never
enforced that law.
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.
I mean, this is the 21 st century,
for heaven's sake.
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.
Yeah!
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.
Lord Palimore?
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Not all of us are sure that the princess
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.
Ooh!
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.
I suggest this honored body
allow Princess Mia one year,
during which time she must marry,
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.
What? No.
- I object. I object most strongly.
- One year?
- 60 days.
- Two months.
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...
No.
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or." There's... I...
An arranged marriage is my only choice.
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?
Uh...
You agreed to an arranged marriage.
- Right.
- Yes, I did.
And it turned out quite splendidly.
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.
I'm sure, Grandma, but...
I dream of love, not fondness.
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.
This is so unfair.
Courage is not the absence of fear,
but rather the judgment
that something else is more important...
than fear.
There are 550 years
of Renaldis on these walls.
And I will be up there
next to my father.
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.
Spoken like a true queen.
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.
You should be our king.
I agree.
But how can we make it happen?
Give me one of your arrows.
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.
Niccolo Machiavelli.
I can make this dart
hit the bull's-eye every time.
Yes, but that is cheating.
You've got it.
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer
because he wants to learn about security.
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.
- He wants an audience with you.
- What, now?
Now.
Lionel?
Short.
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.
Of course, of course.
- Your Majesty?
- Hm?
I would gladly take a bullet for you.
Oh, how brave.
Most interns don't even
want to fetch me my tea.
The limousine is at the gates, madam.
The viscount
is not staying, just the nephew.
Joseph, I want you to protect him
and keep your eye on him at all times.
- Of course. Lionel.
- Oh, hello.
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?
Very appropriate. And pretty.
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.
I did.
Wha...
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.
It's not a very difficult job,
you know.
You just have to open the door
before the passenger dies of old age.
- Hello, I'm here to welcome you.
- Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy, you know?
I mean, he is rude,
he's arrogant, self-centered, he's...
Ah, well, have you met him?
- No.
- Neither have I.
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?
- What is that about?
- Oh, tush.
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.
We will present ourselves
with grace and poise.
Announcing Viscount Mabrey
and Lord Devereaux.
Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.
- Mabrey.
Ma'am, may I introduce my nephew,
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.
Nicholas. We are delighted
to make your acquaintance.
Your Majesty, the pleasure is all mine.
And thank you so much
for inviting me to stay at the palace.
May I present my granddaughter Mia.
Your Highness.
Mia, would you care to welcome our guest?
Lord Nicholas.
She always does that.
Uh...
I will personally
get some ice for that foot,
and I'll be with you
as quickly as I possibly can.
An accident.
Of course.
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?
Sorry.
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...
We danced, and I flirted.
I feel so stupid right now.
I see. Well, as your queen
I absolutely cannot condone it.
As a grandma, I say, "right on."
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.
- Oh, yeah.
- I think you could leave that right there.
Uh... Yeah.
Thank you, culinary people.
I'll be back.
The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.
This is your very own suite.
- Are you serious? This is...
- Mm-hm.
- This is my room?
- Yes.
Oh, Grandma.
This is very nice.
Good.
We just made the bed.
This is so cool.
Ah, Fat Louie. I think
he rather likes his new abode as well.
There's more.
- Is that mine?
- Why don't you go and find out?
OK.
I have my own mall.
Ooh, very nice shoes.
I'm glad you like it.
Try pressing button number three.
Oh.
They're charming. I love these.
What do you think? Grandma?
I'm here.
Oh, hello. Ooh, love that.
- This is...
- Now press combination 656.
Um... They're a little... gorgeous.
I had a selection
of the crown jewels brought out for you.
They're yours to borrow,
with great discretion, at appropriate times.
Now for the best surprise of all.
Wow.
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown
after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...
- You're here.
- I know I'm here.
- You're in Genovia.
- I know.
- You're in my closet.
- Yeah.
- You're blonde.
- I'm blonde.
I'm so glad to see you.
I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.
I think I'll let you two ladies
catch up with each other.
I can't believe you're here.
When did your flight get in?
- Just a little while ago.
- Oh.
By the way... I'm getting married.
- To who?
- I don't know.
Baron Johann Klimt.
No, not appropriate.
He's a compulsive gambler.
Yes. Oh, yes,
I, I, I, I absolutely accept.
Prince William. He's not eligible,
because he's in line for his own crown.
Oh.
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?
- I just love to look at him.
- Mm. Me too. Mm-mm.
- Your Majesty.
- Next.
-  Antoine Suisson of Paris.
- Uh-huh.
Plays the harp. No title, but good family.
- What about the title "husband"?
- Yeah, he's cute.
Mm. His boyfriend
thinks he's handsome also.
Right on.
No matter. Put him on
all the invitation lists. He's a divine dancer.
Next.
Too old.
Too young.
- Does this popcorn taste like pears?
- Mm. Genovian specialty.
-  Arrested too many times.
- Wait, no.
We need someone titled,
someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.
Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.
Someone with compassion.
Someone like him?
Yes. Someone very much like him.
Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.
- Andrew Jacoby.
- Duke of Kenilworth.
Aw.
Well, he looks... decent.
- Can I do that?
- No.
- You ever take those shades off?
- No.
Here we are
at the breezy seashore village of Mertz.
And our two lovers have perfect weather
for their first public outing.
Along with Andrew's parents,
Susan and Arnold.
Must be rather hard
to get to know each other this way.
Oh, they're waving at us.
- My... Oh.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Mia. A princess
should not run for a scarf.
I got it.
Shall we have some tea?
- Your scarf, ma'am.
- Why, thank you, sir.
I think you might be clumsier than me.
Oh, good shot.
Oh.
No, no, let them bond. Let them bond.
- The glasses. Off.
- I'm coming, Princess.
- I'm coming, I'm coming, Princess.
- Oh, ow.
Oh, there you go.
Ah.
Ah.

Every marriage in my family
for the past 200 years has been arranged...
- Andrew?
- Yes?
Could you try to talk without moving your
lips? The... the readers have binoculars.
Here we find our favorite new royal couple,
nestled under Genovia's famous pear tree.
- And I have something for you.
- Oh, you don't have to get me anything.
- No, my birthday was last week, and...
- Mia. Here you go.
Cool. You know, film.
That's nice. It's... What is that? Is that...
It's a film canister.
What's in the film canister? What's in it?
- Why don't you open it? You'll see.
- Oh, OK.
Oh.
It was my great-grandmother's
engagement ring.
She and my great-grandfather
were married for 57 years.
So I...
I felt it could be lucky for us, maybe.
- Do I have to put it on myself?
- No, I could do that.
- OK.
- Yes.
Oh, my goodness. It was a ring.
A royal proposal has been made.
Fly the lovebirds.
- You ready?
- If you are.
Announcing the royal engagement
of Princess Mia and Andrew Jacoby,
Duke of Kenilworth.
Here, just like the princess.
Princess Mia has managed
to find a husband within a week.
Mia cannot possibly be happy
with the idea of an arranged marriage.
Your task is to romance her.
Show her what
a real relationship could be like.
A relationship filled with heat and passion.
- And change her mind about Andrew.
- Exactly.
And the 30-day deadline expires,
and the throne is ours.
And you're sure my father wanted this?
It was his dearest wish.
His last words to me were:
"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king."
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.
Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.
But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.
No, no, no, no. Niccolo Machiavelli.
Power, my boy,
means never having to say you're sorry.
Here, kitty kitty kitty. Come here, kitty kitty.
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Oh, Your Highness.
- Shh.
Andrew's plane just took off.
He said he'd call
as soon as he arrives in London.
He won't be gone long.
Why are we whispering?
I'm hiding
from my lady's maids.
But I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you having second thoughts?
- No.
Actually, on the contrary.
I was just admiring my ring.
It was Andrew's grandmother's.
You know, he really is so romantic.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I really
must go see to some wedding details.
I'm sorry, is there something
you wanted to say to me?
No, no.
You are the one
who stomped on me with your big feet.
Big feet?
Brigitte, I found her.
Uh, Brigitta.
I'm not here.
It wasn't her. It was a ghost. Whoo...
Well, you know,
you danced with my big feet.
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague,
convene the war-crimes tribunal.
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.
It was more than a minute.
Well, maybe a minute and a half.
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.
Oh. Well, aren't you just...
crafty.
-  Let's look in the ballroom.
-  The ballroom?
- I don't think she's in the ballroom.
- Well.
Do you want to know
what else you were doing,
while you were doing your little lie dance?
- Lie dance?
-  The ballroom?
- Yeah, that is exactly what you did.
- What is a lie dance?
I'll go look
in the ballroom myself.
All right.
The lie dance is not the point.
- The point is that...
- What is the point?
I...
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy,
am I onto what you are trying to do.
- And what am I trying to do?
- I think we both know exactly what that is.
Oh, oh.
Please forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness, Lord Devereaux.
No, you don't... Uh...
I'm told this Lord Devereaux boy
is a native Genovian.
Recently graduated Cambridge,
gourmet cook,
plays polo and rugby,
and is known as quite a ladies' man.
- She was in a closet?
- With him. Yes.
Does she have the makings of a queen?
Well, she's young,
but I've always believed in her.
The wedding invitations
have been sent out.
- She and Andrew make a fine pair, I think.
- Yes, they do.
She's very set on it, you know.
Clarisse, my dear.
Forget the wedding for a moment.
In less than a month,
you will no longer be queen,
and I will no longer
be your head of security.
I think it's time we bring
our friendship out of the shadows.
- Oh, Joseph, I...
- Yes.
Yes, my dear. I would kneel
if it weren't for my knee replacement.
Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.
Mia needs to win over the people
of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.
Perhaps it's time to consider
the duty you have to yourself.
Oh.
Clarisse...
My darling, please think about it. Please.
I will.

Sorry.
They're here. The sparrow is flying.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I am almost in time though.
OK, sorry, got it, I got it.
You know what? I'm OK. I'm fine.
So...
- What are we learning today?
- We are learning the art of the fan.
- Fascinating.
- Yes.
Get up. Get up. We only have about
ten minutes in which to communicate this.
Now, first of all,
one handles a fan very deliberately.
It's a tremendous
tool of communication. That's it.
You can say things like,
"I'm feeling flirtatious. Come hither."
You can say, "I never wish
to speak to you again. Go away."
You can say,
"I'm feeling terribly shy today."
*
*
*
*
And you...
Are you sassing your grandma?
I would never sass you, Grandma.
This is also a way
of showing you're annoyed.
We will have somebody come
and visit your farm in the morning,
and perhaps we can repair
the well and save your field.
This is for your table.
Thank you.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You do this so well. They just adore you.
It's part of an ancient Genovian tradition.
One has to be fair and very honest.
Even if you can't help,
you have to show the people you care.
Citizen Jacqueline Grenough.
We will review
your scholarship application,
and someone will be in touch
no later than the end of next week.
Oh,  Your Majesty.
Here is a melon for your table.
Oh,
Citizen Tiny Duval.
- Your Majesty.
-  Tiny.
May I present
my granddaughter, Princess Mia.
- Princess Mia.
- Monsieur.
Thank you for seeing me today.
Something for your table.
Thank you.
She's my favorite.
I hope you like omelets.
- May I?
- Of course.
Be careful.
- Aw, it's a chicken.
- Careful.
We have a chicken situation
in the throne room.
Mia.
Yeah?
A princess never chases a chicken.
- I can't ride sidesaddle.
- No, no, no.
I couldn't ride sidesaddle either
when I was your age,
and frankly, dear,
it is acutely uncomfortable.
Herbie is my riding companion.
Here he is.
Herbie.
- It's a wooden leg.
- Yes.
That is impressively sneaky, Grandma.
Did you come up with this on your own?
-
-
Hear ye, hear ye.
Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi
reviews the Royal Guard of Genovia.
Now, the last time we spoke,
you mentioned that Princess Mia's horse,
Sandy, gets easily spooked by snakes.
So let's get it really spooked,
shall we?
This is a fake snake.
Oh, you're very observant.
A regular David Attenborough.
That's rubber, yes.
But it will spook the horse.
I'm Nick. Viscount Mabrey's nephew.
Ah, the chap who's trying
to stage the palace coup.
I'm Andrew Jacoby. Nice to meet you.
Lilly Moscovitz, official best friend
of future queen. I don't like you.
Pleasure.
Atten... hurgh!
I like all these men wearing helmets.
Open ranks... hurgh!
Sandy... Oh! Oh! Oh!
My goodness. Oh, my...
- Easy. Sandy, easy.
- Princess.
Princess. It's OK, Princess. I'm here.
No wonder she's so clumsy.
She's got a wooden leg.
Talk about getting off on the wrong foot.
The ceremony has officially ended.
You shouldn't hide.
It only makes them gossip more.
What do you want?
Just think, Mia. One more leg
and you could've easily outrun your horse.
I don't need this right now.
Mia, I'm...
I'm sorry, I...
No, you're not.
You never think about anyone but yourself.
So just this once,
can you please let me be miserable,
and not make me feel
worse about myself?
- Just go away. Go away, go away...
- Mia...
Princess, excuse me.
The queen has arrived.
Yes.
Nicholas.
Am I going to be disappointed in you?
Unfortunate incident, that.
I'm just leaving.
You going to come and see me off?
I'd like to speak
with your uncle alone, Nicholas. Please.
Viscount. You may not be aware of what
my job entails as the royal head of security.
My job is to protect the crown,
to make sure no harm comes to the crown.
To step in when someone toys
with the crown's emotions, you see.
I think the entire country understands how
well you cater for the crown's emotions.
If you hurt my girl,
you will answer directly to me.
And whatever crimes
I commit against you, remember:
I have diplomatic immunity
in 46 countries.
Including Puerto Rico.
Sir, you will find that the word "fear"
is not in my vocabulary.
Perhaps.
But it's in your eyes.
You forgot something.
-
-
Nicholas, I...
I want to ask you a question.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?
Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.
And you feel you do know the people?
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.
I am a true Genovian.
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian until high school,
and to be frank,
she's spent little time here since then.
Well, I happen to feel
that she'll make a great ruler.
She's terribly bright, sensitive, caring.
- I know that.
- You do?
Yes. Yes, I do. But...
How can one rule the people
if they do not know the people?
Touche. That's a very good question.
Opera's new rising star, Anna Netrebko.
Looks good enough to eat.
How are your grandchildren,
Lily, Charlotte and Sam?
They're wonderful.
Thank you for remembering.
How are you? Good to see you.
How's your dachshund? Maury, right?
He is great.
You remember him from last summer?
Mia's doing well.
Some major mingling, I see.
A little higher, Olivia.
Mia.
- Did you happen to see who's here?
- Who?
The king wannabe with Lady Elissa.
Oh.
Is she his... girlfriend?
Nicholas doesn't have girlfriends,
he has dates.
But attractive ones.
- You talk to him much?
- Uh...
We acknowledge each other.
- Andrew?
- Yes, dear. Coming.
Yuck.
- Well, the camera's all ready to go, so...
- All right.
Let's go this way.
No more straggling for me.
- You did very well, Mia. Very charming.
- Oh, thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait. The light is perfect.
- What?
- Just one more, please.
- Please, no more pictures.
- Come on, please. One more.
- It's very flattering, but...
Mia, one more picture...
Ah.
Hello. I'm Andrew Jacoby.
- Oh, hello. Lady Elissa.
- Pleasure.
- Lady Elissa.
- Your Highness.
Hello.
Elissa and I were just discussing
her latest achievement.
- She's received a Rhodes Scholarship.
- Nicholas, please.
Why not brag? You're an amazing woman.
Elissa, congratulations. You know, Andrew
has a PhD in anthropology from Oxford.
- Oh, really? That's wonderful.
- Fantastic.
- Elissa was in the Peace Corps.
- Really?
Andrew spent four months in Papua New
Guinea studying the bark of a yam tree.
- Elissa single-handedly...
- Andrew...
Elissa is actually trying to say something.
Yes, Lady Elissa?
Andrew, would you like to get a drink?
I have a feeling they're going to start
a "My horse is bigger than your horse" run.
I would absolutely love to. Excuse us.
You know, her horse actually is very huge.
- Oh, really?
- Yes...
- Fantastic party.
- It is.
- You two make such a lovely couple.
- We do. Thanks.
- It's a shame you're not attracted to him.
- I know, it...
You... I... Come back here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a special treat for our friends from Asia.
Jonny Blu.
Come back here. You... you can't just
say something like that and walk away.
I will have you know
that I am very attracted to Andrew.
Well, obviously.
I am. He's... We are perfect for each other.
- He understands me...
- Understands you? Wow. What passion.
I didn't hear you mention love.
- You are so jealous.
- Why would I be jealous of Andrew?
He's got to spend
the rest of his life married to you.
I loathe you.
- I loathe you.
- I loathed you first.
Wait. What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
You can't just go around kissing people.
- Particularly not engaged people.
- You enjoyed it.
- You want to kiss again?
- Well, I...
No! Stop trying to confuse me.
What's confusing about a kiss?
You're just trying to make me like you
so that I won't want to marry Andrew
and so that you can have the crown. Oh!
Well, maybe I am, and...
maybe I just like kissing you.
You... You stay away from me.
Mia...
You know what?
I have an idea. I have a brilliant idea.
Why don't you go underwater
and I'll count to a million?
Mia, careful... Mia.
Do I want to know?
I don't think so.
I'll be two seconds, Mia.
She's going to be a handful, isn't she?
You'll never be bored, Andrew.
Yes.
- Olivia, enough goodbyes.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Eagle is leaving! Eagle is leaving!
- In hushed tones, Lionel.
Hushed tones.
When are you going
to start acting responsibly?
Hiding in a closet
with a man who is not your betrothed?
Coming out of a fountain dripping wet with
the same man, who is not your betrothed?
Do you think I plan
for this kind of stuff to happen?
I lost it. Sometimes you just lose it.
You can't afford to lose it. Other people
lose it. We're supposed to find it.
People look up to us, and we're
held to higher standards of behavior.
Can you try to grasp that concept?
The concept is grasped.
The execution is a little elusive.
Oh, I would say so.
Try to get some sleep. You'll want
to look fresh for the parade tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night, Grandmother.
Well, Maurice, it's just you and I.
Or are you upset with me too?
Royal Guard of Genovia, fall in.
Big parade day.
Identify, Mustang personnel.
Why do you talk like that?
I'm Captain Kip Kelly of the Royal Guard.
What if we all talked like that?
Lilly Moscovitz, best friend
of Princess Mia, riding in the 'Stang.
That was very nicely done, Miss Lilly.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.
The prettiest girl is riding in the 'Stang.
- Flag?
- Thank you.
Flag? Welcome.
Welcome, Viscount Mabrey.
May I offer you a flag?
Thank you, I am not a waving aficionado.
But I will wave our national flag
when a true Genovian king
once again sits on the throne.
King Nicholas.
Flag?
How do you feel today, my dear?
Honestly, Joe, not that great.
Well, would you feel better
if you called me Joey?
- No, Joe.
- Good.
- Come on, Joseph. We're already late.
- Her Majesty is ready.
Can't keep the people
of Genovia waiting any longer.
Happy Independence Day, Genovia!
Here we are in Pyrus, capital of Genovia,
for the big annual parade.
Here they come.
There's Prime Minister Motaz,
strutting his stuff.
* Genovia, Genovia
People are coming
from all over Genovia.
Here's the Mertz Marching Band,
led by Lucy Carmichael.
And now, of course,
the Libbet's folk dancers.
Also known as the "Leapers of Libbet."
And now the queen, with Princess Mia.
Na-na, I don't like your braids.
Hey, thumb-sucker.
Stop the carriage.
What... what's going on? Mia?
- She's stopped the parade.
- How rude.
Uh-oh.
What's the princess going to do now?
She's walking towards
the children's shelter.
- Hello, everybody.
-  Hello, Princess.
Hello. What's your name?
Carolina.
And what are your names?
- John.
- Blake.
Did I see you messing with Carolina?
They were tugging on my braid.
Excuse me. These children are?
Most of them are orphans.
We care for as many as possible.
