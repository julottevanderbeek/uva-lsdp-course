Hello, l´m Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...
but at the same time,
restore its creative power...
to reinvigorate our society...
My name is Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
Our obligation...
California families
who live by the rules...
and work hard
and pay their taxes...
shouldn´t be paying
for people who do nothing.
l´m Jay Bulworth.
I believe in a hand up,
not a hand down.
I need your support on Tuesday.
l´m Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
l´II fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs.
l´m Jay Bulworth.

Our welfare system
is out of control.
Of course we should help...
My name is Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
My wife Connie and I
have been married for 24 years.
She´s been a loving partner,
and more importantly...
Connie´s been my friend.
CONSTANCE: Jay has been a great
senator for California...
but the best job he´s done is
as a loving husband and father.
I believe
in the old-fashioned values...
of honesty and decency
and fidelity.
Join me in my crusade...
to strengthen
California´s families.
Hello, l´m Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
l´m Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
We can´t afford any longer
to give people privileges...
on the basis of race.
It´s time we realized
discrimination in the past...
doesn´t justify discrimination
in the future.
Hello, l´m Jay Bulworth.
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
Our welfare system
is out of control.
Of course we should help
families who truly need it...
but too often, welfare
is a permanent subsidy...
for able-bodied people
who could and should...

JAY: Hello, this is
a telephone answering machine.
Leave a message at the beep.
MAN: If you´re there,
pick up the goddamn telephone.
I know you´re there.
Pork bellies, indeed.
l´ve just spoken with Hong Kong
again, and l´m very upset!
That´s the wrong word.
l´m pissed, pissed...
pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed!
I warned you repeatedly
about Fenner.
That son of a bitch and
his pork belly goddamn schemes.
And now he tells me...
He tells me you´ve invested
nearly everything you had...
and they´re selling
the goddamn things short.
HELEN: We got the check.
The senator would just love
to have drinks with the sultan.
Will the sultan be
in Beverly Hills?
- Has he buzzed yet?
- No.
MURPHY: Feldman call?
DOBISH:
It´s 6:15 in the morning in L.A.
MURPHY: I don´t care.
Get me Liebowitz and Macavoy.
DOBISH: I only got two hands.
l´m too old to grow a third.
MURPHY: I didn´t ask you
to grow anything new.
Just get me the calls.
DOBISH: And Mr. Chow?
What about Mr. Ling?
Tell me, did his check clear?
DAVERS: Hey, Senator.
It´s a beautiful morning.
The birds are singing.
The leaves are...
doing whatever leaves do.
Did you eat anything?
It´s Friday.
That pizza´s from Wednesday.
Ahem.
Fenner call?
He said you sold pork bellies
short, and now they´re up again.
I mean, is that a disaster?
Davers, do I look like
a disaster to you?
Good morning.
The poll´s
worse than we thought.
We´re down by four points...
but the new spots
are playing absolutely huge...
and we´II get 900 grand
from the Sunday brunch.
You might be asked about that
insurance bill in five minutes.
DAVERS: Which insurance bill?
S2720...
regulates insurance companies.
Makes them sell it
to poor people.
DAVERS: That´s a good bill.
MURPHY:
Not for insurance companies.
DAVERS: What, are we working
for the insurance companies?
We do today, or Tuesday,
we don´t work for anybody.
We´re trying to get
Should we talk on the way?
Senator, Missy Berliner,
Los Angeles Times.
JAY: Sam.
Senator, your challenger
in next Tuesday´s primary...
said you were, quote,
´´an old liberal wine...
´´trying to pour himself
into a new conservative bottle. ´´
JAY: We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
- That kind of mistake can hurt.
- What mistake?
MURPHY: The both sides remark.
Hello, Constance.
CONSTANCE: I don´t know
why your people would think...
I have nothing better to do
than wait around.
I have no objection
to doing my part...
but the least you can do
is to get your staff...
to show some respect
for my time.
JAY: Uh-huh.
What about both sides?
MURPHY: It was Bob Sheer, right?
Weren´t we supposed to go with
´´We´II get back to you, Bob? ´´
´´Both sides´´ implies the other
side is worth considering.
- Where´s Becky?
- She doesn´t want a photo op.
CONSTANCE: She´s 17. She wants
to be with her friends.
Is she mad at me?
She´s not mad. She´s 17.
Just send her money.
She´II be fine.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile in the back, please.
CONSTANCE: OK, that´s it.
JAY: Uh, Con... Uh...
MURPHY: We want to thank you all
for your help.
Any other help, please
make payable to Bulworth ´96.
DOCTOR: Serum cholesterol,
folate level...
liver function, blood pressure,
EKG... they´re all fine.
Are you eating?
Uh, no, thanks.
No, l´m asking, have you
experienced a loss of appetite?
No, no, no.
l´m just not very hungry.
When was the last time you ate?
HELEN: Mr. Fong
and the Chung family left.
Will Mr. And Mrs. Wang
be in California?
CROCKETT:
Hello, Helen, how are you?
- Hello, Mr. Crockett.
- Hello, Mrs. Dobish.
Mr. Crockett,
American Insurance Federation.
DOCTOR: Jay. Jay.
Are you telling me you haven´t
eaten or slept in three days?
That´s not good.
Maybe you should talk
to someone.
l´II give you a name.
Milton Alexander.
He´s head of Psychiatry
at Georgetown.
Uh, I got a meeting here.
This bill will devastate us.
- It will be...
- Crockett.
CROCKETT: Can I call you back?
DAVERS: Doc, how´s he doing?
Fine. Fine.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, fine. You?
- Fine.
- Fine.
Can you believe
this goddamn regulation bill?
Is the whole world going insane?
When you consider
the dislocation...
in the relationships
with the state commissioners...
or the effect
on the rate structure...
This bill´s
gonna cost us billions.
And it´s the usual people
making trouble.
You think l´m gonna say
it´s the African Americans.
It´s not the African Americans.
I have no problem
with African Americans.
l´m not other people.
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan...
I have no problem with them.
They have good jobs.
But you throw down
some lazy, welfare-taking...
drug-dealing,
rap-singing punk...
and tell me my people
have to give him a policy. Why?
So he can burn down his house?
Or smoke crack and get AIDS?
JAY: You can´t get AIDS
by burning your house down.
DOBISH: We got
the broadcasters, insurance...
A.M. A... Buddhists?
What about the Buddhists?
Vinnie! Ha ha ha ha!
Vinnie, you son of a bitch,
how are you?
How you been?
Other than the prostate
like a coffee cake...
a little ticker trouble...
terrific.
To use an overworked phrase,
this bill is...
The bill is un-American.
And I have
total confidence in you...
that you can bottle up this bill
in committee.
What have we got there?
Oh, I got
your homeowner´s insurance...
disability insurance,
umbrella, liability...
and I see no reason
why you shouldn´t have...
a couple million dollars
in life insurance.
I thought we said ten.
- What?
- Ten. Ten million.
Pesos?
Senator... Ha ha ha.
I feel constrained to remind you
that what we said was...
a couple of million
paid to your daughter...
Four payments,
ten million dollars
to my daughter.
Would five do it?
Why don´t we just say seven?
Ten million.
That´s a lot of life insurance.
If Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we´II play ball.
DAVERS: Oh, Senator,
I want you to meet Vinnie.
JAY: Vinnie, how are you?
Ready for the weekend
research project?
Davers, could you excuse us?
Thanks.
DAVERS: Uh, all right, Senator,
l´II be right outside.
HELEN: Tell her we need
U.S. American dollars.
JAY: Small bills.
I wish I didn´t have to go
through Davers to talk to you.
Davers can always reach me.
Davers is a sweetheart.
JAY: Did Davers ask you...
what the weekend
research project was?
VINNIE:
Uh-uh.
JAY: Good.
Nobody knows but you and me.
VINNIE: You and me, Senator.
JAY: That´s good.
Here´s a couple of pictures
of the person.
Give them to whomever
is gonna do the, uh...
- Research.
- Research.
This is the first time...
l´ve ever arranged
to get a guy to off a guy...
who I don´t know who the guy is
who he´s gonna off.
You mean, research.
Yeah, research a guy
who I don´t know who it is.
You said
you didn´t have to know.
l´m just the liaison. I don´t
want to know who this is...
and I don´t want nobody knowin´
nothin´ about me.
I need to talk to you,
I call Eddie Davers.
You need to talk to me,
you call Eddie Davers.
That way nobody knows nothin´.
- Fine.
- Except for one thing.
- What´s that?
- I gotta know who this guy is.
- You just said...
- But that was in the abstract.
Now that we´re really
doin´ it...
and you don´t tell me
who this is, and then, uh...
Simple math.
Take a look.
Excuse me.
What´s the gag?
He will be arriving at LAX...
tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.
A check for the second half
of the money.
If l´m not dead by Monday,
I stop payment on that check.
P. A:
Thank you for flying with us.
Have a pleasant stay
in Los Angeles.
As you exit the aircraft,
our flight agents...
will help direct you
to any connecting flights.
Oh, and have a nice day.
MURPHY: Welcome back.
Did you sleep on the plane?
We´re running late, so let me
run through some changes.
By the way,
excellent work with Crockett.
The final haul
from the Sunday brunch is 1.1.
Insurance came up with 250.
We got two from oil, banks
are in for one and a half...
A.M.A. and the lawyers
came in just south of 100.
Gloria Allred got very excited
over your O.J. statement.
Even the women have coughed up.
Came in with about 65.
We do have a new schedule.
We have a black church,
and then we have Beverly Hills.
VINNIE: He´s here.
MURPHY: It´d be nice later
to have a drink with the sultan.
VINNIE: The guy is nuts.
FRED: Welcome home, Senator.
- What´s this?
- I told you.
MURPHY: Twenty-four hours
on the campaign trail.
This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.
And Fred Tinsdale
and Mimi Binder.
FRED: How you doing?
Mimi and I are gonna be...
right behind you
in the truck, Senator.
MIMl: Fred, get in the truck.
So, C-SPAN
is gonna be with us all night?
MURPHY: All weekend.
Tonight´s installment...
airs tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.
JAY: Where are we going?
MURPHY: First stop, we are going
down to South Central.
Did you get a copy
of the schedule?
We´re gonna be on the go.
First stop is South Central and
the African-American community.
Gee, your African-American
constituents...
down in South Central...
don´t forget what you´ve done
for them, do they?
Where we going?
MURPHY: Down to Grace Church.
- Fred.
- What?
Did you say
you´d covered Bulworth before?
FRED: Yeah.
These things go by the book.
MURPHY:
Then over to Beverly Hills...
to meet some big names
in the entertainment business.
MURPHY: Scotty, how are you?
Vivian, Rwanda,
I didn´t expect you to be here.
Those key chains look fantastic.
How you feeling, Senator?
Get any sleep on the plane?
Has Mr. Murphy
forgotten something?
FELDMAN:
Mr. Murphy, the senator?
MURPHY: Whoops.
Senator? Senator Bulworth.
Senator...
MINISTER: The honorable senator
from California...
the Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Hey, that´s a nice
little piece of timing.
MINISTER: Amen.
MURPHY:
Senator, your speech, sir.
MINISTER: Amen!
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.
MURPHY: Listen to this.
I put a little time in on this.
JAY: And at the same time,
restore its creative power...
to reinvigorate our society...
And, uh...
bring about a, uh, rebirth
of, uh, democracy, uh...
Any questions?
FELDMAN: Nice. Less is more.
WOMAN: When the riots went down
four years ago...
you promised us
federal funding to rebuild.
What happened?
What happened was...
we all knew
that was gonna be big news...
so we all came down here...
Bush, Clinton, Wilson...
got our pictures taken, told you
what you wanted to hear...
and we pretty much
forgot about it.
MURPHY: Ha ha ha!
Did you hear that?
Let´s see where he´s going.
We can´t get health insurance,
fire insurance, life insurance.
Why haven´t you come out
for Senate Bill 2720?
Because you haven´t contributed
any money to my campaign.
You know how much insurance
companies come up with?
They depend on me
to get a bill like that...
and bottle it up in committee
during an election...
and then we can kill it
when you´re not looking.
When you say ´´by the book, ´´
what book would that be?
WOMAN: So the Democrats
don´t care about us?
JAY: Isn´t that obvious?
Half your kids are out of work
and the other half are in jail.
Do you see any Democrat
doing anything about it?
Certainly not me.
What are you going to do,
vote Republican?
Come on. You´re not
gonna vote Republican.
Let´s call a spade a spade.
I mean, you can have
a Billion Man March.
If you don´t put down
that malt liquor...
and stop backing a running back
who stabs his wife...
you´re never gonna
get rid of somebody like me.
MAN: Fire! Fire! Fire!
TANYA: Yo, fire alarm!
Nina, let´s be out.
WOMAN: Fire!
MURPHY: Right this way, Senator.
What are you doing?
That was good.
That was really good.
WOMAN: Fire!
MURPHY: Does anybody know
where the fire actually is?
Where´s the fire?
Does anybody know
exactly where the fire is?
I find it very worrying
that in 1990 Los Angeles...
churches are burning.
Smell smoke? I don´t smell shit.
FELDMAN: If there´s a fire,
I don´t know where it is.
MURPHY:
We have to be running along.
Coming through. Thank you.
TANYA:
Hey, Senator! Listen, hon.
CHERYL: Like what she said.
We into politics.
TANYA: We want to work
on your campaign.
We need some jobs volunteering.
I don´t mind volunteering.
MURPHY: It´s on to Beverly Hills
on our new schedule...
and our friends the Liebowitzes.
TANYA: We´re into
that whole political... Nina.
MURPHY: To prevent any damage
to this wonderful landmark...
- Yo.
- Yo. Yo to you.
- Later.
- I was hoping for sooner.
- What´d you say?
- Later is good.
You tryin´ to mack on my sister?
MURPHY: There´s no macking
going on here, young man.
I really think
we should be on our way.
We should go.
JAY: Feldman, my friends here
would like to volunteer.
FELDMAN:
What can you help us with?
It´s a shame we didn´t get
into the heart of your remarks.
FELDMAN: You want to volunteer?
You´ve always had tremendous
support in this district.
Come on, that Nina. Woof!
Oh, yes.
JAY: Woof! Woof!
MURPHY: Never underestimate
the value of a frank exchange.
- What does ´´mack´´ mean?
- Mack?
Macavoy, what does mack mean?
Gary, do you know?
Like, ´´You´re macking
on my sister´´?
MURPHY: For you to be running
against Hugh Weldie...
who has just leapt on
the neoconservative bandwagon...
Uh, is your sciatic nerve
bothering you again?
JAY: No, no, no, l´m fine.
Several of our people
find Weldie´s duplicity...
particularly, uh...
You´ve had such a tough day.
What do you say we get you
some downtime?
I could cover for you
at the Liebowitzes´.
- Are you kidding me?
- Absolutely.
After all the money
we´ve worked these guys for?
We get more money from
these jokers than the Chinese.
MURPHY: l´II tell you what.
l´ve got an idea. Pull over.
Gary, what do you say you and I
and your colleagues...
head on over to headquarters?
That is a good idea. Great.
Let´s do that. Come on, Gar.
And we´II see you
in Beverly Hills.
That is a good idea.
Gary, this is gonna be
much better.
You are gonna get
a behind-the-scenes look...
at how a campaign
actually operates.
MACAVO Y:
You eat on the plane, Senator?
JAY: No.
- How long since you ate?
- Wednesday.
Ha ha ha!
Pull in here, will you?
l´m starving.
Let´s get some chicken wings.
MANNY: Frankly, this is getting
uncomfortable for me.
A third of the guests
have left already.
A third of the guests are drunk.
When do you think he´II be here?
MURPHY: I think he´II be here
any second.
MANNY: You do?
MURPHY: He´s had such a day.
The senator is helping
the state department...
work out details
on a new guarantee.
MANNY:
A new guarantee? L´m sorry.
MURPHY: The West Bank.
You didn´t hear it from me.
MANNY: The West Bank.
MURPHY:
He´II be here any second.
TANYA: Yo, Senator Bulworth.
Here we are... volunteer valets.
MURPHY:
Manny and Dorothy Liebowitz.
MANNY:
Hello. It´s good to see you.
Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman
had to leave...
but l´m sure they´d agree
the security of the West Bank...
is more important
than you being on time.
JAY: I was just grabbing a bite.
DOROTHY: Come in.
MURPHY: We´II be out shortly.
We can´t ask the Liebowitzes
to throw open their doors...
to a national
television audience, can we?
MANNY: Nonsense.
Mi casa es su casa, huh?
Yes!
JAY: Oh, miss, um...
Thank you very much.
MAN: Do you think those of us
in the entertainment business...
need government help
in determining limits...
on the amount
of sex and violence...
in today´s films
and television programs?
JAY: You know, the funny thing
is how, uh...
Iousy most of your stuff is.
You make violent films
and dirty films...
and you make family films...
but most of ´em
are not very good, are they?
It´s funny
that so many smart people...
could work so hard and
spend all that money...
and make so much money on ´em...
What do you think it is?
It must be the money, huh?
It turns everything to crap.
But how much money
do you guys really need?
I mean...
you be honest with me,
and don´t spare my feelings.
Do you have any more
of the crispy crab cakes?
TANYA: Wait! Just wait a minute.
CHERYL: Aah!
MAN: Do you think
it´s advisable...
to schedule campaign stops
with industry leaders...
when you have such
a low opinion of their product?
My guys are not stupid.
They always put the big Jews
on my schedule.
You´re mostly Jews here, right?
Three out of four anyway.
MAN: Excuse me?
I bet Murphy put something bad
about Farrakhan in here for you.
MURPHY: Thank you, Senator.
I know I speak for you
when I say l´m energized...
by your...
this kind of give and take.
Can you play that
crispy crab cakes remark again?
MAN: Hey!
Oh, great.
MURPHY: I think everybody
was challenged by your candor.
Let Bob Dole put that
in his pipe and smoke it.
Just get out!
All of you are fired!
TANYA:
Fuck you! We are volunteers.
MURPHY: The senator´s
gonna go to his hotel and sleep.
CHERYL: We stayed
too long already. We out!
- You girls want a ride?
- Yeah!
TANYA: Get the stuff.
CHERYL:
Get in the limo, big butt.
- That shit be awesome!
- Where we going?
MURPHY: Where can we drop
you young women?
Just take us down La Brea.
We´II take a bus.
CHERYL:
No. We goin´ down to Frankie´s.
- Frankie´s?
- Yeah.
We´II take you.
I don´t want to go down
to no Frankie´s.
JAY: What´s Frankie´s?
Are you trippin´?
JAY: Let´s go, Macavoy.
TANYA: I can´t stand when people
wanna flex their authority.
I can´t believe him
tryin´ to tell us to...
MURPHY: I don´t think you need
to feel badly...
about going to the hotel
and getting some sleep.
You´ve had a tough day.
CHERYL: Letterman
ain´t no Arsenio Hall.
TANYA: I heard that Arsenio
was a two-minute brother.
CHERYL: You buggin´.
I heard the head of Arsenio´s
jimmy big as a apple.
MURPHY: Why don´t we take a look
at that new 30-second spot?
My name´s Jay Bulworth.
TANYA: You don´t know nothin´
about Arsenio´s jimmy.
CHERYL: I got the 411
from Sanequa James.
- She saw it up close.
- You mean his dick?
MURPHY: I really like it
when you serve the potato salad.
It´s very dynamic.
CHERYL:
She gave him the nappy dugout.
Nappy dugout?
CHERYL:
Man got a nine-inch jimmy.
TANYA: But she booty ugly!
MURPHY:
Dugout, do some nappy tricks.
JAY: Nappy dugout.
Jimmy and the nappy dugout.
MURPHY: Nappy tricks.
- Some of the Frisbee tricks.
- Yeah.
Our welfare system
is out of control.
MURPHY: Ladies,
we´II just be five minutes...
because the senator is meeting
the cardinal in the morning.
JAY: If I have to meet
with the mackerel snappers...
can´t I just dump the sultan?
MURPHY: Two seconds.
Let me make a security check.
RASTAMAN: Bulworth!
Oom boop sheh bam
oh coo-coo mop
Can ya sing, Bulworth?
Rock until you can´t be a ghost.
You got to sing.
Be a spirit. That´s how
these niggers got here.
Ghosts got ´em
when they touched each other.
Be a spirit!
And the spirit will not descend
without song.
You got to sing, fool.
Don´t be no ghost, Bulworth!
BOUNCER ON LEFT:
Not him. No cameras.
MURPHY: That´s a tough break.
I thought
they´d let you follow us...
but the camera
must make them nervous.
How disappointing.
- He with you?
- He all right.
BOUNCER: Check your weapons.
JAY: I don´t think we have
any weapons.
- Expecting trouble?
- No.
BOUNCER: You can´t do nothin´
in five years.
His family owns a pork shop
for five years.
Go on. You´re good.
He ain´t doin´ it to honor
all the subspecies of life.
MAN: Hey.
JAY: Good to see you, my friend.
That´s...
NINA: What you said
at the church... brave.
MURPHY: If you haven´t
been able to talk to me...
you can talk to me now.
- Go stand by the door.
- Why?
- Keep a look out.
- Nobody can get in.
Good work. Sit down.
Tell these niggers what´s up
Come, come get it
Senator?
Sir, if you´re having...
Excuse me.
I need to talk to the Senator.
If you´re having a problem,
we should talk about it.
What are you concerned about?
l´m concerned that you told
they wouldn´t be a factor...
as long as we´re controlled
by insurance.
l´m concerned you went to
a Beverly Hills fund-raiser...
and told people in entertainment
their product is lousy.
And, since many of them
are Jewish...
you thought it prudent
to mock their Jewish paranoia.
l´m concerned we´re in a club
in Compton...
before the most important
campaign swing.
God knows what illegal activity
is taking place...
and you´re smoking marijuana!
I work for you.
You call the shots...
but I can do my job much better
if you just tell me...
what is this new strategy?
Have a drink, Murphy.
Live your life.
Bartender.
RUTHIE: What the hell are you
doin´ here, sugar? Chillin´?
God damn!
Leroy, get over here!
Have a drink on me, sweetness.
Leroy, look who´s here...
Clint Eastwood! Damn!
- That ain´t Clint Eastwood.
- What do you mean?
LERO Y: That´s George Hamilton.
RUTHIE: George Hamilton?
LERO Y: He got that TV show.
Hey, George, what´s happenin´?
What´s up, man?
RUTHIE: God damn!
- He with you?
- Yeah.
MURPHY: What´s happenin´?
BOUNCER: I don´t care who you
think you know. You can´t enter.
NINA: What you doin´?
Senator, this is fun,
but l´m gonna tell Mac...
to get ready to go.
NINA: Put it away.
What´s up?
NINA: Hi.
DARNELL: You lost, massa?
JAY: How you doin´?
DARNELL: This place
ain´t for you, motherfucker.
NINA: Can we talk?
DARNELL: This place
is for our homies, real niggers.
- He ain´t no nigger.
- I ain´t no what?
You ain´t no real nigger.
Is you a real nigger?
You callin´ me nigger,
motherfucker?
Don´t call me nigger,
motherfucker.
JAY: Would you prefer
´´motherfucker, ´´ motherfucker?
DARNELL: What the fuck?
You can´t call me motherfucker.
NINA: Shit!
You gotta get out of here!
DARNELL: I don´t need my sister
coverin´ my ass!
NINA: Yes, you do!
- Move.
- Where you goin´?
NINA: Get in your car and go!
I saw you rush your brother out.
That´s fucked up.
He owes me money.
If I left him there,
you´d cap his ass.
Motherfucker rip off L.D.,
he a dead-ass motherfucker.
I give people protection
around here. Right?
HENCHMEN: Mm-hmm.
L. D: I can give you
protection or pain.
It´s wrong to embarrass me,
Nina...
wrong and detrimental
to my way of life.
That motherfucker owe me money.
l´m workin´ on gettin´ it.
l´m tired of playing with you.
Whenever I see you,
you say that.
I said l´m gonna get it.
L. D: The only reason his legs
ain´t snapped by now...
is ´cause he´s your brother.
If you fall absolute
I thought ya knew,
I thought ya knew
Bitches are hustlers, too
I thought ya knew
JAY RAPPING:
Now, what I really want to know
Is where did little Nina go?
l´m lookin´ here,
l´m lookin´ there
But I can´t find her anywhere
Where, oh, where
Is little Nina?
l´m happy with Nina
Hello, Nina
Where you been-a
Nina, Nina
Nina
Has anybody seen ´er?
Nina, Nina where you been-a?
You´re the prettiest girl
NINA: Leave.
JAY RAPPING: OK, OK
You come downstairs,
and then we´II play
MURPHY: Excuse me.
Coming through. Sorry.
WOMAN: Damn, motherfucker,
watch yourself!
MURPHY: I am terribly...
You´s a sorry-assed
motherfucker.
MURPHY:
l´m terribly sorry, ma´am.
WOMAN: Keep walkin´, bitch.
l´II whup your ass up,
motherfucker!
l´II give you five dollars
to buy a new suit, punk!
Excuse me. L´m sorry.
- He won´t leave.
- He´s not tired?
I doubt he´s slept
the past five days.
- There´s something else.
- What?
He´s rhyming now.
- Rhyming?
- Rhyming.
He´s talking in rhymes.
It´s very, very disconcerting.
JAY RAPPING:
Yo, Nina, Nina, l´m over here
And this is really good
if you give it a chance
I never even knew
that I could dance
I guess some people can
and some people can´t
But I don´t even care
if I splits my pants
FELDMAN: We had a neighbor
who´d lose her mind sometimes.
What´s weird is,
when she got that way...
she´d only speak in song lyrics.
JAY RAPPING: Murphy, Feldman,
you´re lookin´ pretty beat
I thought you might feel better
with some ribs to eat
Eat ´em, gentlemen,
you´II think they´re really fine
And if you want a couple more,
you can get ´em anytime
l´m incredibly frightened.
SINGER:  Hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey-oh
CROWD:  Hey-oh,

SINGER:

Just bounce to the beat, yeah
I once knew a girl

The only thing

Was take the club,

All I did was jump and go
RAPPER: Hey, Lou,

The one with the weave

Just bounce to the beat,

WOMAN SINGING:
Talkin´ ´bout the firm
That is, that is,

My pops used to warn me
Never fall victim to the pornie
Keep the pussy tight

The pussy... the pussy tight
That bitch
If l´m gonna fuck,

I whip my dick out... whu-whu...
When I whip out my dick,

Hey, guys!
RAPPER: The dick,

Plays that dick, that d-dick
I need some pussy
Some dick, dick
MURPHY: Senator Bulworth, sir?
The fund-raiser!
RAPPERS: Some pussy, his dick,
some pussy, his dick
MURPHY: The Beverly Wilshire
fund-raiser starts in 5 minutes!
Senator, the brunch
begins in five minutes.
But are you up to speaking?
JAY: Up? What´s up?
Perhaps Barbara Boxer
should talk.
It´II be fine.
Give me the speech.
Hey, Murphy, we had a good time.
MURPHY: You´re very tired, sir.
Just give me the speech.
You girls want breakfast
at the Beverly Wilshire?
Where´s Nina?
MURPHY: We could drop you at
that chicken and waffles place.
It´s really yummy.
Have you ever tried it?
JAY: Where´s Nina?
LERO Y: Nina said
she´d see you later, George.
- L´m comin´.
- Oh. OK.
MURPHY: I think it´II be fine.
He got it out of his system.
JAY: Don´t worry.
l´II be fine this time.
MURPHY: You can get some sleep
at the hotel afterwards.
JAY: It´s gonna be fine.
MURPHY: And freshen up.
OK, Macavoy.
Beverly Wilshire, chop chop.
JAY: You got nothin´
to worry about.
l´m tellin´ you,
the man is a rock.
He looked in my eyes and said,
´´This bill is un-American. ´´
This man is granite.
Good. We´re down 3 1/8, and
the bill´s still in committee.
It never will get out.
Jay Bulworth´s on this baby.
FRED: l´m sure all he needed
was a good meal and some sleep.
MURPHY: Senator?
Your speech, sir.
Go get ´em.
Hiya, Constance.
Good of you to show up.
Rough night at the prom?
MURPHY:
We´re back on track.
- How´s Edward?
- Edgar.
I like Edgar.
l´ve always liked Edgar.
Knock it off.
STONE: Once in a generation,
if we´re lucky...
an individual
whose life and work...
are the life and work
of the people he represents.
Such is the man
who has served the people...
of the state of California...
Senator Jay Billington Bulworth!
JAY: Thank you, Bill Stone.
We stand on the doorstep
of a new millennium.
We have an obligation...
on one hand, to reduce...
Ahh...
Yada yada...
Yada yada yada.
It´s up to the people
to decide...
what the state of California
and the nation will do.
Biddy biddy bid...
Ooh, what´II we do?
The nation will do
It´s up to you. What´II we do?
What´II we do,
well, it´s up to you
You know, it ain´t that funny,
you contribute all my money
You make your contribution,
then you get your solution
As long as you can pay,
l´m gonna do it all your way
Yes, money talks,
and the people walk
Yeah, now let me hear ya say it,
big money
CHERYL AND TANYA:
Whoa! Big money, big money
JAY:
Big money, big money, big money
Big money, big money, big money
One man, one vote,
now is that really real?
The name of our game
is ´´Let´s Make a Deal´´
Now people got the problems,
the haves and the have-nots
But the ones that make me listen
pay for 30-second spots
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, Bank of America
at this table over here
Wells Fargo and Citibank,
you´re really very dear
Loan billions to Mexico
and never have to fear
´Cause taxpayers,
taxpayers take it in the rear
CHERYL AND TANYA: Take it
in the rear, take it in the rear
JAY: Yo, over here
we´ve got our friends from oil
They don´t give a shit
how much wilderness is spoiled
They tell us
that they´re careful
We know that it´s a lie
As long as we keep drivin´ cars,
they let the planet die
CHERYL AND TANYA: Let the planet
die, let the planet die
JAY: Exxon, Mobil,
the Saudis in Kuwait
If we still got the Middle-East,
the atmosphere can wait
The Arabs got the oil,
we buy everything they sell
But if the brothers
raise the price
We blow ´em all to hell
CHERYL AND TANYA:
Boom boom boom boom
JAY: Now let me hear ya say it
- Saddam
- Saddam
- Hussein
- Hussein
- Saddam
- Saddam
- Hussein
- Hussein
Mmm
MURPHY: Get me a phone number.
Dr. Morris Fishman, UCLA.
He´s at the Department
of Psychiatry.
Get the number now.
JAY RAPPING: Yo, everybody
gonna get sick someday
But nobody knows
how they´re gonna pay
Healthcare, managed care, HMOs
Ain´t gonna work,
no, sir, not those
´Cause the thing that´s the same
in every one of these
Is these motherfuckers there,
the insurance companies
Yeah, yeah
You can call it single-payer
or Canadian way
Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day
Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word
Socialism!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now, the women in the world
is mistreated and abused
But when we try to fix it,
we tend to get confused
I got respect
from all the sisters
They will tell you
that´s my style
But there´s one thing
in politics
That always makes me smile
I like the pussy, the pussy,
I like it really fine
And when you be a senator,
you get it all the time
The young ones, the old ones,
they really like ´em all
And when you be in Washington,
you hardly have to call
The women, they love power
And if you don´t
pull that rug out
No matter what they say or do,
they give you nappy dugout
MIMl: Now, would we be eligible
for an Emmy or a Peabody?
REPORTER: Will rap be
a regular part of your campaign?
JAY RAPPING:
A part of my campaign?
Now, that just sounds insane
- Went well, don´t you think?
- Extremely.
REPORTER: Is campaign finance
reform your central issue now?
JAY RAPPING:
It´s the only way to go
If these guys pay the piper,
then the piper does a show
MURPHY: You got that right.
Bye, fellas.
MURPHY: Wait in here.
l´II be right back.
REPORTER: Patricia Ireland

Will you have a meeting
with her?
SECOND REPORTER:
How does this approach sit...
with the National
Organization of Women?

- ´´Phat´´?
- You got a room here?
- Huh?
A room we can go to upstairs?
- A room?
- A room.
FELDMAN:
What do you want to do now?
We could proceed to
the church, then the debate...
or we can shut down
until the debate.
Dr. Morris Fishman
is in Paraguay.
- It´s your call.
- My call?
It´s my call?
I know it´s my call!
JAY: Feldman?
Uh, Feldman?
REPORTER: Is Mrs. Bulworth

Yes, sir?
Uh, Feldman, could I

Oh! Sure.

- Key?
- Right. Sorry.
REPORTER: You have no fear...
your big money sources
are gonna dry up?
What?
- Senator Bulworth?
- It´s in the car.
FELDMAN:
The Senator needs his room key.
MURPHY: Senator, we have
to get in the car now, sir.
JAY:
Key´s in the car. Let´s go.
MURPHY: Why don´t you
get some sleep now?
JAY: Yes. Nina and I
are going up to the room.
- That´s not a good idea.
- Yes, it is.
- You and her right now?
- Yes.
MURPHY: l´ve got a better idea.
You and I get in the limo alone
and circle back when you want.
JAY: Why would I do that?
MAN: Will the insurance industry
respond well to your remarks?
MISSY: Senator,
where is the nappy dugout?
JAY RAPPING:
Where´s the nappy dugout?
That´s where you get the bug out
REPORTER: How are you gonna keep
the American Medical...
MISSY: Who are the girls?
JAY RAPPING: The girls?
They´re friends of mine,
can´t you see?
Feldman, Feldman,

RASTAMAN: The key´s
in your hand. You got the life!
You got the life,
ain´t it grand?
You got the life
REPORTER:
Senator, how do you intend...
RASTAMAN: You got
to be a spirit, Bulworth.
You can´t be no ghost.
You got it all, Bulworth.
Ain´t life grand?
Ain´t it grand?
You got the life, man.
MURPHY: Let´s go, Macavoy.
We´re on the move.
JAY: Give me the phone.
I need Davers.
You got to be a spirit,
not a ghost!
Macavoy,
you know where Davers is?
MACAVO Y: No, sir.
Maybe he´s at our next stop,
the church.
You´ve had a crushing weekend...
ANSWERING MACHINE: This is
Eddie Davers. Leave a message.
You should get some sleep.
Davers, this is the Senator.
Once you get this message...
call the man you introduced me
to in Washington.
Tell him he has to cancel
the weekend research project.
It´s very important.
See you at the church.
MURPHY: The church in Pasadena.
We can drop
the young supporters off.
Where can we take
you young ladies?
TANYA: We rollin´ with y´all!
Senator, a pleasure to see you.
WOMEN: Cardinal! Yo!
I hope Mrs. Bulworth
isn´t under the weather.
No. She´s fine.
l´II be with you shortly.
TANYA: Y´all got a choir
in your church?
CAMERAMAN: l´m with the network.
JAY: Find Davers.
The weekend research project
has to be canceled.
The weekend research project
has to be canceled.
Macavoy, go in there
and find Davers.
l´ve got to find Davers.
REPORTER:
Sir, a couple of questions.
The glory of his name
- You see him?

REVEREND: We are honored today
by the attendance...
of United States Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.
Let us rejoice
in his presence...
and sing hymn number 376.
Joyful, joyful
We adore thee
God of glory
Lord of love
Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers

I got some problems,

Just get out of the car.

PUBLIC ENEMY RAPPING:
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
CHERYL AND TANYA SINGING:
Thou our father
Christ our brother
All who live in love are thine
Teach us how to love each other
Lift us to the joy divine
NINA: If you´re so afraid,
why don´t you tell me why?
JAY: I can´t.
I just need a guy to call a guy.
NINA: Call the guy yourself.
I don´t know how.
Let´s go back to the hotel.
- You liked that hotel.
- I gotta stay out of sight.
PUBLIC ENEMY RAPPING:
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
Kill ´em live
It is worse than arrogance.
It is contempt.
Contempt for the press
and for the people.
Have you heard a rumor that
Gephardt´s looking for someone?
JAY: l´m staying out of sight
until he gets back.
We can wait in the car.
MURPHY: Hi, Mimi.
We lost our ride to the debate.
Can we catch a ride
with you guys?
- He split with the limo?
- Yeah.
JAY:
So who walks in? Huey Newton.
You know who Huey Newton was?
A lot of people I talk to...
black, your age... don´t know.
Huey.
Why do you think
there are no more black leaders?
NINA: Some think it´s because
they all got killed...
but I think
it´s from the decimation...
of urban manufacturing bases.
Senator, an optimistic,
energized population...
throws up optimistic,
energized leaders.
When you shift manufacturing
to the Third World...
you destroy
the blue-collar core...
of the black activist
population.
Some people would say
the problem is cultural.
But the media is controlled
by fewer and fewer people.
Add to that a consumer culture
based on self-gratification...
and it means nobody
wants leaders...
calling for self-sacrifice.
Fact is, l´m a materialist.
If I look at the economy...
high employment means
jobs for African-Americans.
World War II meant
lots of jobs for black folks.
That´s what energized people
for the civil rights movement.
An energized,
hopeful community...
not only produces leaders,
but leaders they´II respond to.
What do you think, Senator?
What do you think my age is?
Your age?
You said black people my age.
Oh. 23?
Twenty-six.
How old do you think I am?
How old?
Hmm?
Sixty.
My mother was a Panther.
Huey Newton
fed kids on my block.
JAY: Huh.
DAVERS: Senator,
aren´t you late for the debate?
JAY: Davers, Davers, Davers.
l´ve been looking for you
everywhere.
DAVERS: l´m here.
JAY: We have to call Vinnie.
You know what I get
out of this place? Bupkus.
Talk to you later.
- Yeah?
- Vinnie, it´s Nina.
You a fucking bimbo?
I couldn´t get him
up to the room.
VINNIE: You´re incompetent.
You didn´t
have to push him off.
You just had
to get him upstairs.
l´ve had it with you!
Vinnie, wait.
You move on to plan B.
What the fuck is plan B?
You know plan B.
And you better get it done.
You said if I got him up
to the room, l´d get 10 Gs.
- Fucking bimbo!
- Vinnie.
DAVERS: Vinnie! Davers.
The Senator
wants to speak with you.
Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie, my friend,
how are you?
Vinnie, l´m very relieved
to get in touch with you...
because we´re gonna have
to call off...
the weekend research project.
Call it off?
- That´s not a problem, is it?
- Not a problem?
My plans have changed.
But you keep the fee.
That´s not a problem, is it?
No.
Oh, good!
Good, good, Vinnie.
Let me ask you a favor.
Can we keep this
just between the two of us?
You and me
and whoever´s doing the thing?
We´re gonna need a surcharge.
- Fine.
- Cancellation fee.
OK. Just keep the check.
No. An additional 50,000.
That´s good.
l´II send Davers over right away
with another check.
Shall we consider it done?
Yeah.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.
You´re welcome.
Fuckin´ crazy motherfucker.
Senator, what is
a weekend research project?
No, it´s a... It´s nothing.
It´s all off.
That guy´s nuts.
I don´t feel too good.
Want something?
Vinnie.
You want something?
Vinnie!
I gotta go. L´m out.
JAY: All right!
All right!
We´re late,
we´re late, we´re late!
For a very important debate!
And l´m feeling so great
while l´m feeling my fate
when I get to the gate...
DAVERS: Senator!
JAY: ´Cause I got a new slate
on my plate and it´s great
If you want to hide,
I know a place.
You think after all this crap
is over Tuesday...
that maybe you could
actually, like, hang?
- Hang?
- Hang out with me?
Oh, hang out with you.
What do you think?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
I got the plan.
Want to meet my family tonight?
Oh, that would... That´s great.
That´s great, that´s great
I got a whole new slate
I get to meet the family,
I can hardly wait
MURPHY: I think he´s finally
recognizing the situation...
and getting some sleep.
FELDMAN: There´s...
MURPHY: OK, listen to me.
l´m not letting him
on television...
until he explains himself.
Say he got a disease
or stuck in traffic.
We´II stand here
and block him...
arms akimbo if necessary.
Prevent him from doing further
damage to his and our careers.
l´m explicitly authorizing
the use of force at this point.
JAY: Murphy, Feldman, Macavoy.
FELDMAN: Hey, boss.
MURPHY: Didn´t work.
I think he´s OK now.
Got the electric razor?
- I got the razor.
- Get him to shave.
FELDMAN: They´re ready.
How about a quick shave?
The format agreed to
is as follows...
there will be
no opening statements.
Questions will be addressed
to each of the candidates...
in alternating order.
The candidate to whom
the question is addressed...
will have two and a half minutes
to answer.
The other candidate will then
have one minute to reply.
And the first candidate will
then have another 30 seconds...
for a final comment
on that question.
After the allotted time
for questions...
each candidate
will make a final statement...
of three minutes.
Mr. Weldie
won the drawing of lots.
He´s elected to make
his closing statement.
NINA: I was supposed
to set him up, not do the shit.
Now I can´t even get Vinnie
on the damn phone.
HILL: The first question
will be from Jann Carl...
and is for Senator Bulworth.
CARL: Senator, the news today
requires us to ask you...
about this sudden change
in your campaign style.
Could you explain it?
JAY: Why are you here?
Admit it.
It´s ´cause you make a bundle.
CARL: I beg your pardon?
You´re not here ´cause you´re
getting paid a bundle of money.
Come on, come on.
We got three
pretty rich guys here...
getting paid
by some really rich guys...
to ask a couple
of other rich guys...
questions about their campaign.
But our campaigns are financed
by the same guys...
that pay you guys your money...
so what are we talking about?
NINA: l´m bringing the man
down there.
If they don´t like it,
they can kiss my ass.
I could tell you stories...
about getting money from them
that would pin your ears back.
Stories about me.
I don´t know about Hugh.
Do you have that, uh...
Well...
But, uh, I tell you...
WOMAN:
He´s got something hot here.
JAY: Republicans, Democrats,
what´s the difference?
Your guys, my guys,
our guys, us guys.
It´s a club...
so why don´t we just,
uh, have a drink? Hugh?
No?
You know, Hugh,
if you win this thing...
you really gotta think about
where your kids go to school.
We put our daughter in
Sidwell-Friends with Clinton´s.
The Gores really like
St. Albans...
but a public school
anywhere around Washington...
is a disaster.
CLARK: Excuse me, Senator.
If you don´t mind...
I think we´re here to ask
about the news of your camp...
JAY: News?
What are you talking about,
the news?
Come on, the guys you and I
get our money from...
they don´t want the people
to have the news.
They want you to think
that corporations...
are more efficient
than government, right?
You want to know
why the health care industry...
is the most profitable business
in the Unites States?
´Cause the insurance companies
take 24 cents...
out of every dollar
that´s spent.
You know what
it takes the government...
to do the same thing
for Medicare?
Three cents out of every dollar.
Now, what is all this crap
they hand you...
about business
being more efficient?
MURPHY:
What the hell is going on here?
JAY:
These guys need to be regulated.
You think these pigs
are gonna regulate themselves?
What´s going on?
HILL: If you´II please pardon
the interruption...
it seems
as if we´re experiencing...
some technical
difficulties here.
JAY: Hey, Hugh, what´s up?
What´s up?
What´s happening, baby?
l´m doing what I got to do.
l´m bringing him down there,
God damn it.
HILL: Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand by.
We are experiencing
technical difficulties.
DIRECTOR: What´s going on?
Are we gonna do this or not?
PRODUCER:
We´re doing the best we can.
Oh, hi, Davers.
Uh, power failure.
If he wants to crash and burn
his entire fucking career, fine.
Fuck him!
But l´II be goddamned if that
asshole´s taking us down, too.
It´s not like l´ve not been
completely Ioyal to that fucker.
l´ve had other offers, you know.
I beat ´em off with a stick.
Didn´t he have it all,
though, Bill?
Looks, brains,
more or less enough...
classy wife...
but Jesus Christ, Bill...
for God´s sake, he had us.
The motherfucker had us.
If he had just listened to me
on welfare reform in ´88.
If he just chased
not quite so much pussy.
Could have gone all the way.
But, hey, we still might.
but now...
with this shit...
we´re fucked in the ass, man.
Fucked in the ass
with our pants down.
Cocksucker.
MURPHY: Fuck.
Hi, Larry.
LARRY: Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.
How the hell are you?
MURPHY: You ever seen anything
like this?
Let´s just say
it is very unusual stuff.
Well, I don´t know what to say.
Let´s face it. L´m gonna have
to do a show on this.
Oh, my God, no, Larry.
Come on. Do you have to?
No. Sure you wanna handle it
like that?
You kidding?
The guy´s on a roll.
They want someone like this.
People are sick and tired
of all this baloney.
I want him on my show.
That´s exactly what I told him.
Now he´s finally listening.
The man´s got this giant vision.
We´re finally getting it out.
l´ve been hammering away at him.
It´s very gratifying
that he´s listening to me.
It´s very gratifying to me.
That´s just between you and me.
What are we talking about?
ASSISTANT:
We´ve got Clinton tonight.
Bump him! Just kidding.
Um, how about tomorrow?
- Book him.
- We´II call you.
LARRY: Call him.
MURPHY:
Nobody´s seen this in years.
LARRY: This is it.
Your boy is it.
MURPHY:
He´s it. It´s kind of historic.
LARRY: You´ve got insight.
MURPHY: No. You´ve got insight.
You´re the guy that saw it.
LARRY: You´re the one
that´s been telling people.
PRODUCER: Senator, Mr. Weldie,
l´m sorry to say...
but we´II have to cancel this
for today.
They don´t want to bump
Jerry Springer.
l´m sorry, folks.
That will be it.
CROCKETT:
Oh, fine, Senator, how are you?
You´re not feeling
like you need a vacation?
JAY: Not really, no, no.
CROCKETT: I gotta tell you,
l´m confused...
because you and I
could play ball.
But you are playing
a much rougher brand of ball...
than l´m accustomed to.
I have your policy here.
JAY: Oh, the policy,
Crockett, thank you.
Forget it. I don´t need it.
Everything OK?
DAVERS: OK is not the word
for it, Senator.
Hong Kong pork bellies
are way down...
and you´re back in the chips.
JAY: Good. Did you give
the guy the check?
- Aw, poor guy.
- What?
DAVERS: Well, he collapsed.
JAY: What? He collapsed?
Probably a heart attack.
CROCKETT: When you have
a moment, we have to sit down.
Did he cancel the weekend
research project?
- I guess so, boss.
- You guess so?
Well, I don´t know.
He was in a coma.
I left the check.
Where is he?
Cedars. He´s in intensive care.
You turned off
the electricity...
because you knew
he was telling the truth!
You could have resumed
that debate...
but you didn´t want Americans
hearing what he had to say!
Don´t bullshit me!
JAY: Go there. Sit with him.
Wait till he wakes up.
You ask him if he canceled
the weekend research project.
OK? Now, if he didn´t...
you ask him who´s he gotta call,
all right?
OK, boss.
CROCKETT:
Senator, when you have a moment.
N.W.A. RAPPING:
Runnin´ with my brothers
Headed for the home base
With a steady pace on the face
they just replaced
Getting longer
than a motherfucking marathon
If that´s what I got to do
But nobody´s picking up
a nigger with an attitude
Stuck and runnin´ hard,
haulin´ ass
´Cause l´m a nigger known
for having a notorious past
My mind was slick,
my temper was too quick
Now the FBl´s all over my dick
Got us tick and running
Just to find the gun
that started the clock
That´s when the ´´E´´ jumped off
the starting block
A hundred miles from home,
and yo, it´s a long stretch
A little sprinting motherfucker
that they won´t catch, yeah
Runnin´ like I just don´t care
Compton´s 50 miles,
but yo, l´m gonna get there
From city to city,
l´m a menace till I pass by
Ripping up shit
just so you can remember
l´m a straight-up nigger
That´s done in, gunnin´,
and comin´ straight at your ass
A hundred miles and running
Running like a nigger,
I hate to lose
Show me on the news,
but I hate to be abused
JAY: God...
N.W. A: So now l´m gonna get up
JAY: You gotta get out.
NINA: You´re crazy,

´´Why the fuck not? ´´
´´I don´t want to talk about it. ´´
You don´t wanna talk about it?
You were on a fuckin´ roll.
PRESIDENT CLINTON:
Our commitment...
to carry those enduring ideals
with us...
will renew their promise
in a new century...
and a new millennium.
We have got...
We´ve got to balance
the federal budget.
FELDMAN: Wanna see me
balance a spoon on my nose?
CLINTON: People who like
government programs that...
Shit.
Where´s Nina?
L. D: Good lookin´ out
on the shorties, you know?
It ain´t every day
that a white man...
comes to rescue
my little soldiers.
I appreciate it, you know?
JAY: Little soldiers?
Uh, what... what exactly
do you know about it?
Your ass live up in
Beverly Hills somewhere, right?
I provide for these

These little brothers
is my first line of defense.
They my little eyes and ears.
Where´s Nina?
L. D: l´m givin´ them
entry-level positions...
into the only growth-sector
occupation...
truly open to them right now.
That´s the substance
supply industry.
They gonna run this shit
someday.
They gonna have
the whole empire.
You don´t give a fuck about it.
You greedy-ass politicians.
That´s what you tell me...
every time y´all vote
to cut them school programs...
and vote to cut them funds
to the job programs.
Fuck, how a man gonna handle his
financial responsibilities...
workin´ at motherfuckin´
Burger King?
He ain´t.
And don´t start
with the school shit.
They ain´t no education goin´
on up in that motherfucker.
Y´all motherfuckin´ politicians
done fucked the shit up.
So what they gonna do?
What a man supposed to do, then?
He gonna come to me,
that´s what.
Why? ´Cause l´m a businessman.
As a businessman, you gotta
limit your liabilities.
That´s what these shorties
offer me... limited liabilities...
because of their limited
vulnerability...
to legal sanctions.
It´s the same fuckin´ thing
in politics, Dog.
You find an edge,
you exploit it.
That´s why y´all sent them
motherfuckin´ teenagers to Iraq.
Die over some motherfuckin´
oil money.
Send the motherfuckin´ CIA
up in the ´hood...
with all the yayos.
Slangin´ in the ´hood.
It´s the same shit in politics.
There´s a time when every homie
Got to risk his neck and fight
For the thing that he believe in
And he got to preach it right
If he don´t got shit to die for
And he´s ´fraid
to shed the light
Then he ain´t got shit
to live for, scumbag
Is that how white people rap?
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Goddamn,

You gonna hang with this man?
After your mama´s life

You know how I feel.

And rather than contend

MURPHY: I think it´s important
for you to have longer pants.
As a matter of fact,
the shorter pants...

urban youthful quality, sir.
The glasses are good,

I really wanna see your eyes.
The hat´s wonderful.
Like the hat.

Welcome back.
In our Los Angeles studio...
we have incumbent
Democratic Senator...
Jay Bulworth of California.
Good evening, Senator.
Senator,
why this new campaign style?
Why this new manner
of dress and speech?
HOST: Your ethnic manner
of speech, your... your clothes...
The use of obscenity.
Obscenity?
GARY:
But, gee, my third cousin?
OK, he was. It´s true.
On the playground...
and they´re tryin´ to get it
above the rim.
I think it´s great.
I like it better.
l´m not begrudging him that,
are you?
Of course not.
Of course l´m not.
The rich is gettin´
richer and richer and richer
While the middle class
is gettin´ more poor
Just makin´ billions
and billions and billions
And billions and billions
and billions of bucks
Well, my friend
lf, uh, you weren´t
already rich at the start
That... that... that situation sucks
´Cause the... the richest
motherfucker in five of us
Is gettin´ ninety-fuckin´
eight percent of it
And every other motherfucker
in the world
Is left to wonder where the fuck
we went with it
Obscenity?
l´m a senator
I gotta raise $10,000 a day
every day l´m in Washington
I ain´t gettin´ it
in South Central
l´m gettin´ it
in Beverly Hills
So l´m votin´ in the Senate
the way they want me to
and... and... and
l´m sendin´ them my bills
But we got babies
in South Central
dyin´ as young
as they do in Peru
We got public schools
that are nightmares
We got a Congress
that ain´t got a clue
We got kids
with submachine guns
We got militias
throwing bombs
We got Bill
just gettin´ all weepy
We got Newt blamin´ teenage moms
We have factories closin´ down
Where the hell
did all the good jobs go?
Well, l´II tell you
where they went
My contributors make more
profits makin´, makin´, makin´
Hirin´ kids in Mexico
Oh, brother can work
in fast food
If he can´t invent
computer games
But what we used
to call America
That´s goin´ down the drains
How´s a young man gonna meet
his financial responsibilities
Workin´ in a motherfuckin´
Burger King? He ain´t!
And please, don´t even
start with that school shit
There ain´t no education
goin´ on up in that motherfucker
Obscenity?
We got a million brothers
in prison
I mean,
the walls are really rockin´
But you can bet your ass
they´d all be out
If they could pay
for Johnnie Cochran
The Constitution´s supposed
to give them an equal chance
Well, that ain´t gonna happen
for sure
Ain´t it time to take a little
from the rich motherfucker
And just give a little
to the poor?
I mean, those boys over there
on the monitor
They want a government
smaller and weak
But they be speaking
for the richest 20 percent
When they pretendin´
they defendin´ the meek
Now, shit, fuck, cocksucker
That´s the real obscenity
Black folks
livin´ with every day
Is tryin´ to believe
a motherfuckin´ word
Democrats and Republicans say
Obscenity?
l´m Jay Billington Bulworth
And l´ve come to say
The Democratic party´s
Got some shit to pay
It´s gonna pay it in the ghetto
It´s gonna pay it in the...
Senator, are you saying
that the Democratic party...
doesn´t care about
the African-American community?
JAY: Isn´t that obvious?
A lot of people think...
there are no black leaders today
because they all got killed...
but I think it´s the decimation
of the manufacturing base...
in the urban centers.
Don´t you think so?
What do you think my age is?
DIRECTOR:
He´s had his time. Flush ´im.
You know, the guy in the booth
Who´s talking to you
in that tiny little earphone?
He´s afraid the guys at network
gonna tell him he´s through
If he lets a guy keep talking
like l´m talking to you
´Cause the corporations
got the networks
And they get to say who gets
to talk about the country
And who´s crazy today
I would cut to a commercial
if you still want this job
Because you may not be back
tomorrow with this corporate mob
- Cut to a commercial
- OK, flush ´em.
Cut to commercial,
cut to commercial
Cut to commercial
OK, OK, I got a simple question
That l´d like to ask
of this network
That pays you
for performing your task
How come they got the airwaves?
They´re the people´s,
aren´t they?
Wouldn´t they be worth
If some money-grubbin´ Congress
Didn´t give ´em away
for big campaign money?
It´s hopeless, you see
If you runnin´ for office
Without no TV
If you don´t get big money
You get a defeat
Corporations and broadcasters
make you dead meat
You been taught in this country
there´s speech that is free
But free do not get you
no spots on TV
If you want to have senators
not on the take
Then give them free air time
They won´t have to fake
Telecommunications
is the name of the beast
That, that, that, that...
That´s eatin´ up the world
from the West to the East
The movies, the tabloids,
TV, and magazines
They tell us
what to think and do
And all our hopes and dreams
All this information
makes America phat
But if the company´s
out of the country
How American is that?
But we got Americans
with families
Can´t even buy a meal
Ask a brother
who´s been downsized
If he´s gettin´ any deal
Or a white boy bustin´ ass
till they put him in his grave
He ain´t gotta be a black boy
to be livin´ like a slave
Rich people have always
stayed on top
By dividing white people
from colored people
But white people got more
in common with colored people
Than they do with rich people
We just got to eliminate them
- Eliminate?
- Eliminate.
- Who, rich people?
- White people.
- Damn!
- Black people, too.
Brown people, yellow people.
Get rid of ´em all.
All we need is a voluntary...
free-spirited,
open-ended program...
of procreative
racial deconstruction.
Everybody just gotta
keep fuckin´ everybody...
till they´re all the same color.
Damn!
JAY: I think it... it´s gonna
take a while, but, uh...
HOST:
Thank you, Senator Bulworth.
We´II return with former

JAY: It wasn´t the guy.
Uh...
A few days ago,
I made a deal with a guy...
for a lot of life insurance...
and then l, uh...
I paid a guy to hire a guy
to get rid of me.
I tried to call it off...
but the guy I paid
had a heart attack.
He´s in the hospital
in a coma...
and there´s absolutely no way
to contact whoever the guy is...
that he hired to do the job
and tell him it´s off.
You know,
there´s a lesson here...
which is never try to make
life or death decisions...
when you´re...
when you´re feelin´ suicidal...
because you... you can´t...
Vinnie´s too cheap
to hire a hitman.
All I had to do
was get you upstairs.
He was the one who was gonna
push you off the balcony.
But I didn´t get you up there.
He said if I wanted the money,
l´d have to do it myself.
NINA: Here.
I changed my mind.
JAY: Huh?
What?
NINA: So... you get it?
Ain´t nobody gonna kill you.
You get it?
Jay?

with its last day
of heated campaigning...
before going to the polls
tomorrow.
In the Democratic
Senatorial race...
challenger Hugh Weldie began
campaigning early today...
in the San Joaquin Valley.
His opponent,
Senator Jay Bulworth...
is said to be meeting
with top advisors.
JAY RAPPING: Call it
single payer or Canadian way
Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day
Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word
Socialism!
TV REPORTER: Where is
Senator Jay Bulworth?
SECOND REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?
THIRD REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?
As the Bulworth campaign
heads into its final moments...
before tomorrow´s primary...
it appears to have decided to
keep its candidate under wraps.
JAY RAPPING: The real obscenity
Black folks livin´ with
every day
Is tryin´ to believe
a mother  word
Democrats and Republicans say
Obscenity?
l´m Jay Billington Bulworth
FELDMAN: Call the police?
MURPHY: Think an APB
on the Senator election night...
is the kind of press
we´re looking for?
TV REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?
SECOND REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?
REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?
That´s the question
everybody is asking...
this election day
after the Senator...
astonished the political
establishment yesterday...
by making no appearances.
Bulworth Campaign Chief
Dennis Murphy said...
the Senator was behind
closed doors...
and would probably meet
with the press later today.
TV REPORTER: Good evening.
It´s California primary night.
The polls have closed...
and nobody´s seen
anything quite like it.
The big surprise
is Senator Jay Bulworth.
Bulworth appears
not only to have won...
the Democratic
Senatorial nomination...
with a whopping 71%
of the vote...
he´s received 15%
of the Democratic vote...
and 8% of the Republican vote
as a write-in for president.
Bear in mind, Bulworth
has never expressed interest...
in running for president.
Political analysts from
the Bay Area to the Beltway...
are scratching
their heads in wonder...
over this unprecedented
turn of events.
CHERYL: No, Nina´s no idiot.
If she was tryin´
to hide the Senator...
then she´d just...
What? If she were gonna hide
the Senator, what?
- Is he still sleepin´?
- Still sleepin´.
REPORTER: . . Into the house
and find out if he is here.
Feldman. Feldman.
TV REPORTER: Now, this is
a most unusual situation.
BO Y: Hey, L.D.
You got customers, man.
TV REPORTER:
Nobody seems to have seen him.
BO Y: L.D., man, come on.
Ahem. What´s up?
UNCLE TYRONE: The house
looks good, Momma Doll.
MOMMA DOLL:
They can´t see the flowers.
UNCLE TYRONE:
Can´t show ´em in a close-up.
MOMMA DOLL: Why don´t they show
my flowers?
MURPHY: Hey, man, um...
it´s very important that I speak
with Senator Bulworth, sir.
Is... is he here?
UNCLE TYRONE: Would you mind
waiting in the street?
l... I can´t wait in the street.
Um, uh, l´m totally cool.
l´m the Senator´s
chief of staff.
l´m not a member of the press,
and so...
Momma Doll said
don´t mess up her flowers.
REPORTER:
Seems to be an impromptu powwow.
Maybe we can get
some information.
You know when we might expect
a statement from the Senator?
MURPHY: Very, very shortly,
I promise you.
MISSY: Murphy, Murphy.
It is worse than arrogance.
It´s contempt.
It´s contempt for the press.
He´s been missing two days.
Who do we call, Robert Stack?
What possible explanation
could possibly satisfy me?
None. Is he in that house?
UNCLE TYRONE:
Uh-oh, think we got a problem.
AUNT ALICE: He still sleepin´?
TV REPORTER: The group
of Bulworth Democrats...
agreed on one thing...
Leading is more important
than winning.
SECOND REPORTER: Jonathan,
if you´d pan over here...
NINA: Just sit tight.
SECOND REPORTER: Clearly
everyone is tight-lipped here.
It´s still a mystery as to
what is going on in this house.
We are in South Central
Los Angeles.
UNCLE DAVID: What´s up, L.D.?
L. D:
This brother owes me money.
- You gonna get your money.
- I don´t want it no more.
- What?
- He don´t want the money.
L. D: Look at me, D.
Look at me, brother.
You gonna work it off.
NINA: Work it off?
What´s he gonna be doin´?
L. D: We got some things
we need to do...
and you´re gonna
help me do ´em.
And if you don´t help me do ´em,
Darnell...
Come here, Snag.
Look here,
I got a reputation to protect...
you understand that?
So you´re gonna have to wear
these casts right here.
And you got a choice
whether we break your legs.
Now if you´re down with us...
we´II let you wear them casts
without breakin´ your legs.
´Cause l´m gonna flip this whole
power shit a different way.
And for the sake of your pretty
little daughter right here...
I hope you make...
TV REPORTER: In recent days
he has not been seen.
This is one of the biggest days
of his political life.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Good sleep?
Yes, I had a very good sleep,
thank you.
It´s good to see you.
How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doin´, Senator?
- Very well, thank you.
You got a very comfortable
guest room out there.
You´ve been very kind.
Good to see you.
UNCLE TYRONE: They been talkin´
about you on TV.
JAY: Have they? Could I borrow
the telephone a second?
Think l´m late
at my headquarters.
- Oh, sure.
- I can´t thank you enough.
I only hope I can reciprocate.
MOMMA DOLL: You wanna stay
for supper? We got kale.
UNCLE TYRONE: He likes
collard greens, not kale.
MOMMA DOLL: He like kale.
He thinks
they´re collard greens.
L. D: Hey, Senator,
congratulations.
Oh, hey, we met not that
long ago at your office.
Yeah, at my office.
- Good to see you, l...
- Senator?
MURPHY: Senator Bulworth?
Is this great? This is great.
Congratula...
What are you wearing, sir?
- What do you mean?
- Get into the old clothes.
The numbers on this thing
are astounding.
- The clothes are part of it.
- I don´t think so.
MURPHY: Not just the clothes.
But they´re a part.
I have a 14-state strategy
where you run as an independent.
REPORTER: Have you seen
the Senator this evening?
L. D: We got to take advantage
of this crazy motherfucker.
You gotta decide now.
- You with it?
- L´m down.
MURPHY:
They can take that two ways.
TANYA: Aah!
How ´bout that write-in vote?
Are we runnin´ for president
or what?
CHERYL: You´re my nigger!
You won! I love you.
I love you right now
so much, I swear to God.
TANYA: Don´t swear.
CHERYL: l´m mean, you know...
MURPHY: Plant that thought
in their heads.
If we take the Santa Monica...
we´II be at the Beverly Wilshire
in 23 minutes, make ´´Nightline. ´´
- Olympic´s better.
- It is not better.
MURPHY: We´re taking
Santa Monica and dump the limo.
- Find an old car.
- The limo´s paid for.
- We´re an insurgent campaign.
- L´ve got a taxi outside.
MURPHY: Taxi´s a good idea.
TANYA: Yo, your boy Macavoy
really been lookin´ out for you.
DAVERS:
Oh, man of the hour! Ha ha.
- How are you feelin´?
- Pretty good, thanks.
DAVERS: You´re back
in the chips, Senator.
MURPHY: You moron.
DAVERS:
Come on, they´re waitin´ for us.
MURPHY: Sir, Senator, um...
when you get outside,
I think you just say, um...
CHERYL AND TANYA:
Oh, Bulworth is the man!
Oh, Bulworth is the man!
MURPHY: Just say,
´´Our fight is just beginning. ´´
A couple questions,
then off to the hotel.
MOMMA DOLL:
l´m a Bulworth Democrat, too.
JAY: Are you comin´ or not?
TV REPORTER:
Really an important day...
in the political life
of Senator Bulworth.
MURPHY: Senator Bulworth
will be out momentarily.
He will make a brief statement
and then take your questions.
TV REPORTER: Victory speech.
We´II see Bulworth´s reaction...
to this incredible
primary election.
We naturally would
like to know...
what his response is.
This was an overwhelming
margin of victory.
Is there an explanation
for his erratic behavior...
in the last few days?
REPORTER: Murphy. Murphy.
MISSY: Senator Bulworth,
have you committed adultery?
REPORTER: Have you been
able to get airtime, Senator?
CHERYL: Yo, Nina!
Why you lookin´ like you
never seen this before?
JAY: Let me ask you...
why did you do that?
- Do what?
- You just sat there.
What was I supposed to do?
You just sat, and you made me
feel insecure.
- I made you feel insecure?
- Of course.
- Why´d I make you feel insecure?
- Are you kidding?
First, l´m too old for you.
- And, also, you know, l...
- And what?
- L´m white.
- You´re white?
Yeah.
You´re insecure
´cause you´re white?
Yes. You just sat there.
Oh, come on, Bulworth.
You know you´re my nigger.
Ah, baby!
For my man see
on the inside the outside.
MOMMA DOLL:
The party´s gettin´ rough...
and l´m goin´ home
soon as I find my panties.
L. D: Stay in the car, Nina.
Snag, come here, man. Get back.
Stay in the car, Nina.
Where´d that shot
come from, man?
RAPPER:
A fuckin´ holiday
Every day is a holiday
Another motherfuckin´ dollar day
Every day is a holiday
Holiday
Another motherfuckin´ dollar day
Every day is a holiday
Another motherfuckin´ dollar day
RASTAMAN: Hold on!
We don´t need no more ghosts.
We need a song.
You got to sing, Bulworth.
You can´t be no ghost.
But you got to be a spirit,
Bulworth.
You got to be a spirit!
And the spirit will not descend
without song.
We need a spirit, Bulworth...
not a ghost! Not a ghost!
Come on, Bulworth.
You got to be a spirit.
You can´t be no ghost.
RAPPER:
Y´all deaf, dumb, and blind
Before the whites got us all
Into white collar crime
Behind suits and clean shaves
I can use and abuse ´em
Choose ´em as slaves
I see jobs as plantations
I robbed the damn nations
So I can live in luxury
You fucks with me,
you buried in the dirt
And l´m gonna throw
in the tux for free
It´s insane what´s in there,
can´t get enough said
Action´s on
and we get jail from that
But on the way down
from the depths of hell
You gonna meet in the grass,
oh, it´s psycho black
Like my nigger Jack Frost
My eyes is sore
from bein´ a senator
Behind closed doors,
hittin´ truth to the sea floor
The rich go north,
ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor,
open new and better drug stores
So I became hard-core,
couldn´t take it no more
l´m gonna reveal everything,
change the law
I find myself
walkin´ the streets
Trying to find
what´s really goin´ on
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin´ from afar
Reachin´ for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely on each other
Uh-huh
From one corner to another
Uh-huh
How come, How come
- Kill
- Kill ´em live
- Kill
- Kill ´em live
My man hits the body,
busting caps and hardly misses
Call the taxi
Makin´ sure that it records ya
for my midnight plane to Georgia
Agent double-O player
The life giver
The name William
Propaganda can´t gas
the last man standin´
Assassinate all the planet
Get wrecked,
what you see is what you get
More stars to truck
Against the politics
of robbin´ ´hoods
Fought the government
´cause you know that I would
The FBl´s up to no good
And power to the people
