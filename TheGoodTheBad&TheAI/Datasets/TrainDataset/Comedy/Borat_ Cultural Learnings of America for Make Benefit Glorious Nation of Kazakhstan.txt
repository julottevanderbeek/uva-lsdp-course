Pat Haggerty
Humor Coach.
Should I make joke about
my mother-in-law?
In America, that's a very popular
joke. Do you have a mother-in-law joke?
I have sexy time with my mother-in-law?
- A what time?
Sexy time. I made sexy time
with my mother-in-law.
You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.
I don't think that americans will find
that funny. - No, it is not a joke.
I'm talking about humor.
- Oh, yes, you ask me about my mother-in-law.
Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?
- No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?
Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.
But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.
My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.
Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.
Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say
You will never get this!
You will never get this!
He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.
But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!
That would not be funny in America.
What is a NOT jokes?
A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,
and what we do is we make a statement,
that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.
Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.
What color is your suit?
- This suit is grey.
Grey, I would call it blue.
- It's grey.
All right, it's blue grey,
but it certainly not black.
Let's say it's grey
- It is grey.
A NOT joke I would say:
that suit is black NOT!
This suit is not black.
- No, no, no. Not needs to be at the end.
This suit is black-not.
This suit is black, pause, you know what
pause is? - Yes.
This suit is black NOT!
This suit is black pause NOT.
You don't say pause.
This suit is black.
That's a pause NOT.
This suit is black.
- Ok.
NOT.
Everybody say USA television much better,
but this I watch for three hours and do not change.
This two arrows to change the channel.
Be careful, be careful, CJ.
This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.
And the ass hole of a 7 years old.
For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.
Get Up! Get up!
Why you aren't you ready?!
We have people to interview today!
I understand.
Learn what you can from this women's group.
My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.
In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.
Except for in brothel or in grave.
In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.
I find them all.
Feminist Veterans Of America.
So what does means this feminism?
It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...
You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.
Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.
But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?
That is wrong.
But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.
Your government scientist?
He's wrong.
Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?
Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.
I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.
All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.
Who was this CJ?
Last night, I see, in my hotel room,
a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.
She from a town called the Baywatches.
She's just on television.
Her name was Pamela.
Do she live here in New York?
- She lives in California.
O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.
Ok, can we finish now?
Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.
We're finished, we have to leave.
Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.
or else my wife will snap off my cock.
Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.
I have a telegram for you.
You can read?
- Yes, I can.
Dear Boratsendiev, your wife
Oksana was walking your retarded
brother in the woods when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.
She is now dead.
What you saying my wife is dead?
This it what it's...
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.
Hi 5!
What do you mean "California"?
I have arranged all our filming for New York.
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America -
Rodeos, cowboys...
it will be better for our documentary.
But why California?
What's there?
Pearl Harbor is there...
and so is Texas.
Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California
and make our reportings along
the way.
He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your
driving instructor. Wellcome to our country.
My name Borat.
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.
Now, you do know how to drive a
little bit? - Yes.
Put it in D.
- What?
Drive.
Wait a second, wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?
Yes, many times.
- All right, let's go this way.
Wait a minute, I don't want
you to hit anybody.
Now use two hands now.
- What?
But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.
I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?
Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.
Must not hit the children.
Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?
And maybe make a sexy time with her.
Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.
What!? They do?
- There must be consent.
How about that. That's good, ha?
It's not good for me.
You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.
Who is this car that follow us?
Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.
We'll make a right turn right here.
Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.
You fuck my mother.
He.. do before.
Look on me.
They're gonna throw us in jail.
Me with you.
Why in jail.
He look on me! Behind.
You can't say that.
I like you? Do you like me?
- I do like you.
You are my friend? - You're a nice
young man and I am your friend.
Will you be my boyfriend?
- I won't be your boyfriend.
Why not? You don't like me?
- Don't push, I can be.
Great success. Now time to make purchase
of motorcars.
I want to have a car that attract woman
with a shave down below.
That would be a Corvette.
Or a Hummer.
We will try to help you out here.
A man, yesterday, tell me,
if I buy a car,
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
- He means a car that women would like.
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, no there's no magnet.
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.
Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?
There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.
If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?
It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.
How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?
With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.
When I buy my wife,
at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,
and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,
she become weak, her voice become a deep

happen with the car?

Well thats another fine mess
you've gotten me into.
I have not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.
I have come to make Pamela
Anderson my wife.
So I forgave Azamat.
I knew that you'd make it, Borat.
I felt so bad that I prepared this.
It's everything I could find about Pamela.
Last friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty toward animals.
cruelty toward animals?
And tomorrow she's doing autographs.
She wrote a book.
What? A woman has written a book?
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

We will go to this historical event
and I will marry Pamela there.
...but in the traditional Kazakh way.

- OK.
Pamela, I am not attracted to you
any more!
NOT!
I was humiliated.
It was time for me to return
to New York,
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.
While I sat on the bus, I thought of my
journey over the past three weeks.
The great times.
The good times.
And the shit times.
Mainly there were shit times.
I have come to America to learn
lessons for Kazakstan.
But what had I learn?
Suddenly, I realized.
I have learned that if you chase a dream,
especially one with plastic chests,
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.
Welcome back in my town of Kusek.
Since I return, there has been
much improvements.
We no longer here running of the jew,
it's cruel.
We christians now.
