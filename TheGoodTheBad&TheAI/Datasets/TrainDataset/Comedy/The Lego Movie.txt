He is coming.
Cover your butt.
Cover the what?
Vitruvius.
Lord Business.
You've hidden the
Kragle well, old man.
Robots, destroy him!
ALL: Yes, Lord Business.
Your robots are no match
for a MasterBuilder.
For I see everything!
Unh! My eyes! Ow!
BUSINESS: The Kragle. The
most powerful super weapon...
is mine.
Oh, the Kragle!
Now my evil power will be unlimited!
Can you feel me?
I can feel you.
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.
VITRUVIUS:
Wait. There was a prophecy.
Oh, now there's a prophecy.
About the Piece of Resistance.
Oh, yes! The supposed missing
Piece of Resistance...
that can somehow magically
disarm the Kragle.
Give me a break!
Will make the Piece
of Resistance found
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm
And be the greatest
Most interesting
Oh, wow.
That was a great,
inspiring legend...
that you made up.
A "Special One"?
What a bunch of
hippie-dippie baloney.
Good morning, apartment!
Good morning, doorway!
Good morning, wall.
Good morning, ceiling.
Good morning, floor!
Ready to start the day!
Ah, here it is!
"Instructions to fit in...

soap out of your...! Aah!
Shave your face.

Wait, did he say "put to sleep"?
TV ANNOUNCER:
Tonight on Where Are My Pants?
What was I just thinking?
I don't care.
"Step 11: Greet your neighbors."

Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.

ALL: Go, Sports Team!
EMMET: Always return a compliment.
- Hey, you look nice.
- ALL: So do you!
EMMET: Drink overpriced coffee.
Here you go. That's $37.
Awesome!
Did you see Where Are
My Pants? last night?
ALL: "Honey, where's my pants?"
EMMET: Classic episode.
ROGER: Instructions
coming in from Central.
Okay, it says here to take
everything weird and blow it up.
All right, Cylinderheads...
let's make it look like it
does in the instructions!
MICHAEL: Hey, buddy!
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.
No problem, Michael.
WORKER 1:
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.
EMMET: 2-by-2 macaroni
flying in. Here's one.
PILOT: Guys, got a 1-by-1 with
an indented stud on one side.
- Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody.
- EMMET: Roger that, Roger.
WORKER 2:
Look alive, coming at you.
WORKER 3:
Can I get a couple LURPs over here?
- EMMET: Thanks, Gail.
- WORKER 4: Guys, watch me drill this down.
ALL : Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
Have you heard the news?
Everyone's talkin'
Life is good
Because everything's awesome
Man, I feel so good right now!
I could sing this song for hours!
WORKER 5 :
When you're part of a team!
Yeah!
I'm going to the sports
bar after work tonight.
Who wants to eat some delicious
chicken wings and get crazy?
Chicken wings?
I love chicken wings!
Hey, who wants to share a
croissant with this guy?
Croissants? I love croissants.
Oh, yeah! I sure do
love giant sausages.
Giant sausages? No way!
You know what I love to do?
Is share a meal with the
special people in my life.
Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?
Ah! No, wait, guys!
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.
Oh. Where did it go?
Oh, there you are.
I think I heard a whoosh.
Hey, pal, I hate to
tell you this...
but, uh, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.
Yeah, the rules
specifically state...
work site closes at 6,
it's a hard-hat area only.
That's not official safety orange.
"If you see anything weird,
report it immediately."
Well, I guess I'm gonna...
have to report youuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
uuu...
Where are you going? Miss! I didn't
mean to scare you! I'm sor...
Ow. Ow!
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.
Yeow! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ooh!
Ow.
Ow.
What is that?
What do I do? I don't
have my instructions.
I feel like maybe I
should touch that.
- Uh...
Will make the Piece
of Resistance found
VITRUVIUS: This MasterBuilder will
thwart The Kragle and save the realm
- BAD COP : Wake up.
- EMMET: Ugh.
BAD COP: Come on, wake up!
Where are the MasterBuilders?
How did you find the
Piece of Resistance? Eh?
- Where are the others hiding?
- EMMET: Good morning, apartment?
- Wake up!
- Aah!
How did you find the
Piece of Resistance?
The piece of what?
The Piece of Resistance.
I... I don't... Where am I?
What's happening?
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.
No. I... "MasterBuilder"?
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?
- No.
Or The Special?
No, no!
You're a liar! We'll kill you!
Look, um, I watch a lot
of cop shows on TV.
Isn't there supposed to also be...?
Isn't there supposed
to be a good cop?
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly
neighborhood police officer!
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.
Too bad.
Security cameras picked up this.
Unh! You were found at the construction
site convulsing with a strange piece.
That's disgusting!
Then why is it permanently
stuck to your back?
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah!
It won't come off! It's chasing me!
Look, it's not my fault!
I have no idea how this
thing got on my back!
Of course, buddy. I believe you.
Great. Aah!
I "believe" you too.
You see the quotations I'm
making with my claw hands?
It means I don't believe you!
Why else would you show up with
that thing on your back...
just three days before
President Business...
is going to use the
Kragle to end the world?
President Business is
gonna end the world?
But he's such a good guy.
And Octan, they make good stuff.
Music, dairy products,
coffee, TV shows...
surveillance systems, all
history books, voting machines.
Wait a minute.
Come on, you can't be this stupid.
This is a misunderstanding.
I'm just a regular,
normal, ordinary guy.
I'm late to meet my best
friends in the whole world.
They're probably
missing me right now.
They're probably out
looking around.
"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey,
where's my best friend Emmet?"
Hey, you know what? Ask all
my friends. They'll tell you.
Oh, we asked them, all right.
Boom!
That guy's not a
criminal mastermind.
See?
Yeah. You know, he's kind of an
average, normal kind of guy.
Thank you.
JIM:
But, you know, he's not, like...
GAIL : Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?
Gail doesn't remember me?
- well...
- When you say Harry, I go:
- Harry's got personality.
- WORKER : He's weird! He's weird!
I know that guy but I know,
like, zippy-zap about him.
We just talked earlier.
to everything everybody
else is doing.
You know, he's just
sort of a "Hmm!"
Little bit of a blank
slate, I guess.
We all have something that makes
us something and Emmet is...
There you go.
- I told you I was a nobody.
- BAD COP: Oh.
It's the perfect cover.
Cover? Cover for what?
I can't break him. Take him
to the melting chamber.
What? Aah!
You're gonna melt me?
Am I gonna die?
You'll live. You'll be fine.
President Business.
I have him right here, sir.
Yes, we've told him he'll live so he
doesn't try to escape, but, um...
we're lying to him.
Wait, what did he just say?
Hold still.
Wait! There's obviously been a
mix-up here. You've got the wrong...
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
That is gonna start hurting...
pretty soon.
Ow, ow, ow!
No, no, no!
Whoa. Who are you?
It's you?
Come with me if you wanna not die.
Hi, everybody!
How's the melting goi...?
Hey, hey, hey!
Red alert, red alert.
I need everyone, repeat: everyone,
to go after The Special.
The tunnel's that way.
EMMET: Oh, boy!
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
- Ow. Oh.
So, uh, didn't catch your name...
or anything about what
you're, uh, up to.
Or what we're doing here.
It's brilliant, sir, that you
pretended to be a useless nobody...
but you can drop the act
with me. It's cool.
Oh, the act.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Jump on. Let's go!
- EMMET: Hey, uh, I...
- WYLDSTYLE: Hang on, sir.
BAD COP: All units...
cut him off on Elm, now!
Or whenever you can.
ROBOT :
- Watch out!
- Hold on.
We need to meet up
with Vitruvius...
- and tell him the Piece has been found.
- EMMET: Uh-huh.
BAD COP:
They're up on the monorail.
Release the copper choppers.
EMMET: Oh, no!
Will you please tell
me what is happening?
WYLDSTYLE: I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.
You're The Special.
Me?
You found the Piece of Resistance.
And the prophecy states...
that you are the most
important, most talented...
most interesting...
and most extraordinary
person in the universe.
That's you. Right?
Uh, yes. That's me.
Great. You drive.
What?
I wanna go home!
This is not what I meant!
WYLDSTYLE: Oh, no.
Look out, Special!
EMMET: Uh, sorry. Never
driven a motorcycle. Sorry!
- Wow, he's amazing.
- Aah!
That was incredible!
You're even better than the
prophecy said you'd be.
Oh. Really?
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle.
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?
- Wyldstyle.
- "Wyldstyle"?
- WYLDSTYLE: Yep.
- What are you, a DJ?
- WYLDSTYLE: No.
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?
- Yeah.
Like on your birth certificate,
it says "Wyldstyle."
Let's not talk about my name!
Don't let The Special get away.
ROBOT:
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.
Hang on, sir!
EMMET: What are you doing?
Let's fly!
EMMET: Whoa!
WYLDSTYLE:
Head for the secret tunnel.
EMMET:
Uh, these are the city limits.
WYLDSTYLE:
Let's just head for the tunnel.
You want me to drive into
that weird swirly hole?
Are you insane?
Don't brake! Go!
Don't stop! Go! Now!
I can't do this!
That is against the instructions!
Wait, what's your
favorite restaurant?
Any chain restaurant.
Favorite TV show?
Favorite song?
Oh, no!
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!
Wait. Where are we?
This is so weir...! Ow!
You're not The Special!
You lied to me!
It really kind of depends on...
You're not even a
MasterBuilder, are you?
Uh, I mean, I know what
a MasterBuilder is.
Why don't you tell me what it is?
That way I could see if you're right.
You've ruined the prophecy.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just...
You made being special
sound so good.
And to think I was going to follow
you to the end of the universe.
You were?
Here's the thing.
How do we know for sure
that I'm not The Special?
- We just don't know it yet.
-  Quiet.
COWBOY:
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?
Do you have any idea what
that does to your colon?
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.
- WYLDSTYLE: Just put the hat on.
Oh...
and this. And this. And this.
- And this.
- Aah!
And, by the way,
I have a boyfriend.
Uh, I'm not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.
It's super serious.
You do not want to mess with him.
Okay.
So don't get any ideas.
I never have any ideas.
Wait!
- ROBBER 1: Stick them up.
- ROBBER 2: Hands where I can see them.
EMMET: Hey, uh, listen. You think you can
explain why I'm dressed like this...
and what those big words
in the sky were all about?
And, like, where we are in time.
WYLDSTYLE: Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.
There's also this one...
Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...
a bunch of others we
don't need to mention.
EMMET: Mm-hm.
Lord Business, or as you
think you know him...
President Business...
stole the Kragle, the most
powerful object in the universe.
Blah, blah, blah.
Proper name. Place name.
Backstory stuff.
- ...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
- EMMET: Mm-hm.
I'm so pretty. I like you.
But I'm angry with
you for some reason.
- ...tower at the end of the universe...
- EMMET: Mm-hm.
put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...
and disarm it forever.
Great.
I think I got it...
but just in case...
tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.
WYLDSTYLE: Okay. All the people of the
universe were once free to travel...
and mingle and build
whatever they wanted.
But President Business was
confused by all the chaos.
WYLDSTYLE: So he erected
walls between the worlds...
and became obsessed with
order and perfection.
- BUSINESS: The Kragle!
WYLDSTYLE:
And he hired Bad Cop...
to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.
well, we went into hiding.
Built the tunnels to survive.
And we search for the
Piece of Resistance.
The only thing that
can stop the Kragle.
Kragle. I know that.
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.
President Business was
going to use the Kragle...
to end the world in three days.
I can't make any sense of it.
Taco Tuesday.
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.
We must find Vitruvius and get to the
Office Tower before it's too late.
Okay.
Heh. How scary can
someone's office be?
President Business, we're trying
to locate the fugitive...
but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.
Diabolical.
Okay, have Bad Cop meet
me in my office...
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.
BUSINESS ROBOT: Coffee sales
are through the roof, sir.
Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher!
The roof team is on it.
Sir, can you approve this
poster for Taco Tuesday?
Perfect. Whoo!
- I love everyone in this room.
- ROBOTS: We love you, sir!
- BUSINESS: Great job on the radio station.
- RADIO ROBOTS: Thank you, sir.
We love listening to this
song over and over again.
Keep it up, guys.
Honey, where are my...
- pants?
- AUDIENCE: Ha-ha-ha!
Cut! Ha, ha!
Hilarious. That never gets old.
It does not.
Bad Cop is waiting for
you in your office.
Wonderful. Fantastic.
Would you cancel my 2:00?
This next meeting could
run a little bit...
deadly.
- GUARDS: Aah!
Bad Cop.
Lord Business. I know The
Special got away, but...
Don't be so serious.
Where's the other guy?
- Hey, friend.
- BUSINESS: Hey, buddy!
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?
Have I ever shown you
my relic collection?
Nope. I don't think you have.
Nobody knows where
this stuff comes from.
This one...
is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.
I hear it's super
painful to take off.
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...
No, but thank you.
BUSINESS: We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...
capturing all those
MasterBuilders...
and torturing them and whatnot.
Thank you, sir.
Although...
you did let the Piece
of Resistance go.
The one thing that
can ruin my plans.
The one thing that
I asked you to take care of.
That's super frustrating.
It makes me just wanna
pick up whoever...
is standing closest to me...
and throw them through
this window...
and out into the infinite
abyss of nothingness!
I wanna do it so bad.
I know you do, sir. Please don't.
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.
People everywhere are always
messing with my stuff.
But I have a way to fix that.
A way to keep things exactly the
way they are supposed to be.
Permanently.
BUSINESS: As you can see, they're loading
the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.
I call it...
the Tentacle Arm Kragle
Outside Sprayer.
Or TAKOS.
The "S" is silent.
So on Taco Tuesday...
it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...
with a bunch of super-scary
nozzles like this one!
- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't test it on you.
I'll do it on your parents!
BAD COP: What?
- Hi, son.
- Hi!
How's it going in the big city?
Mommy. Daddy. What
are you doing here?
Okay, Pa. I just want
you to act naturally.
- Like you're going about your day.
- Gotcha.
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.
Ma, scoot...
two steps in to the right.
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?
- ...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.
BUSINESS:
Get back to where you were!
- Here?
- BUSINESS: Perfect.
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.
Right.
Now, Ma...
hand on his shoulder. And you...
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.
You wrecked it!
Bad Cop, you see what
I'm talking about?
All I'm asking for
is total perfection.
Send in a Micro-manager!
MICRO-MANAGER:
Commencing micro-management.
BUSINESS: Hold still, you guys.
And then...
I just spray them...
with the TAKOS.
Oh, Pa, hold me.
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?
We're okay, son.
Just a little stuck, is all.
Go ahead...
finish the job.
Of course, sir.
No, I don't want to.
- You have to.
- I don't want to.
- Would you please be quiet?
- I can't.
- You must. Shut it!
- But they...
- It's not nice.
- It's your job, man.
I can't do it.
- They're innocent.
- Just as I thought.
Your Good Cop side's
making you soft, Bad Cop.
Robots!
Bring me the fleece-crested
Scepter of Q-Teep...
and the Po-Lish Remover of Na-ll.
You've already let The
Special get away once.
Sir.
BUSINESS: I'm just gonna make
sure it doesn't happen again.
No more Mr. Nice Guy!
Oh, son!
On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to
Kragleize the entire universe...
so that everyone will stop
messing with my stuff!
Are you gonna be with me...
or are you gonna be stuck...
having a tea party
with your mom and dad?
SOon?
Sorry, Dad.
I have a job to do.
WYLDSTYLE: All you have to do is blend
in and act like you belong here.
EMMET: Ah, perfect.
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Bullet, bullet, gun.
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.
-  What are they looking at?
- WYLDSTYLE: I made a mistake.
You should just be still.
Act like a stool.
- Wait!
-  Howdy, guys!
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.
- Come sit on me.
Okay, shh.
Let me show you how it's done.
MAN: What a lady!
Okay, let me just
find the wizard...
and get this over with.
- Ooh!
- There he is.
- Vitruvius.
- Who?
I've never heard of that
man, whom I am not.
- Who are you?
- It's me.
I am a blind man and cannot see.
- It's Wyldstyle.
- Oof.
Are you a DJ?
- What? Why does everybody...?
- Oh, wait, wait.
Are you the student
I used to have...
who was so insecure she
kept changing her name?
No, no, no.
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.
- No. Never.
Then Neversmile, then Freakface,
then Snazzypants.
Okay. All right, yes.
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.
EMMET: Oh, man.
You have a very weirdly...
- ...decorated place.
- Thank you.
WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, we have
found the Piece of Resistance.
- Is it true?
- WYLDSTYLE: Yes, but...
Wyldstyle.
The prophecy states that...
you are The Special.
The embodiment of
good, foiler of evil.
The most talented,
most brilliant...
most important person
in the universe.
That would be great...
but Emmet is the one
who found the Piece.
Oh, okay. Emmet!
The prophecy states that...
you are The Special.
- The most talented...
- I'm not sure he's The Special.
Because he's not even a
MasterBuilder. Watch.
Emmet, just given
what's around you...
- ...build something simple.
- Okay.
- WYLDSTYLE: Like an awesome race car.
- Great.
- WYLDSTYLE: Go.
- Do you have the instructions?
No. You must create the instructions
in your mind, my liege.
Ah. Okay. Race car.
Um...
Well, there's a lot of
really cool stuff here.
Don't see a wheel...
or...
three more wheels.
See? He can't do it. He will
never be a MasterBuilder.
Of course not. Not if you
keep telling him he can't.
He needs to see that he can.
What are you doing?
- VITRUVIUS: We are entering your mind...
- What?
to prove that you have the
unlocked potential...
to be a MasterBuilder.
Ujjayi breath.
EMMET: Whoa, are we inside
my brain right now?
- It's big. I must be smart.
- WYLDSTYLE: Mm-hm.
I'm not hearing a lot
of activity here.
I don't think he's ever had an
original thought. In his life.
Ha, ha. That's not true.
For instance, one time
I wanted to have...
a bunch of my friends
over to watch TV...
Not unlike this TV that
just showed up magically.
And not everybody can
fit on my one couch...
and I thought to myself:
"What if there was such a
thing as a bunk bed...
but as a couch?"
Introducing the
double-decker couch.
So everyone could watch TV
together and be buddies!
That is literally the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
Please, Wyldstyle,
let me handle this.
That idea is just the worst.
There must be something
around here...
that proves his potential.
If The Man Upstairs chose
him to be The Special...
there must be a reason.
- EMMET: Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?
He doesn't even know
about The Man Upstairs.
EMMET: Does he have, like,
super-gross hands...
that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?
Wait. You've seen the...?
EMMET: Whoa!
That's what I was
just thinking about.
How did you...?
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.
Emmet, you had a vision.
I did?
MasterBuilders spend years...
training themselves to clear
their minds enough...
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...
that there is nothing in it to
clear away in the first place.
With proper training...
you could become a
great MasterBuilder.
I could?
VITRUVIUS:
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.
But I can't do any of the stuff...
that the prophecy says
I'm supposed to do.
All you have to do is to believe.
Then...
you will see everything.
Are you ready, my son?
Yes, I am.
I think.
Then we haven't a moment to lose.
We must assemble...
the MasterBuilders.
Do you think Zeppelins
are a bad investment?
Any of you fellas seen this guy?
SHERIFF: Wait a minute, partner.
Draw a cowboy hat on him.
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.
They will go to an Internet café...
and e-mail the remaining
MasterBuilders...
who will meet us in the secret
realm of Cloud Cuckooland.
Cuckooland? Wait. What happened
to that whole training part?
Don't worry, Emmet.
Your training begins now.
SHERIFF: Piano man...
open up.
Your training begins later!
On three.
One...
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.
- BAD COP: Freeze, turkeys.
All I want is the
Piece of Resistance.
We would rather he died
than give it to you.
I would not rather he died.
Look, everybody, we can do this
the easy way, or we can do it...
WYLDSTYLE: Go, run!
They took the hard way. Fire!
Fire!
WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, which
way to Cloud Cuckooland?
VITRUVIUS: Head for the big
bright thing in the sky.
- EMMET: You mean the sun?
- VITRUVIUS: Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
WYLDSTYLE: Let's get out
of here. Here, use this.
EMMET: What? Wait, hey...
- What are you doing? Aah!
- WYLDSTYLE: Let's go!
I don't know what I'm doing.
Goodbye.
Boom!
Oh, dang!
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!
Quit playing around in the mud.
I could use your help.
Wyldstyle, we could really use...
your help!
PIGS: Oink, oink, oink.
PIGS: Oink!
WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, they're
gaining on us. Build something!
Let Emmet try!
No, let's not let Emmet try!
I haven't had any training.
That's okay.
We'll start with how to
become a MasterBuilder.
Step one: Trust your instincts.
Okay, okay. Um...
Build something! Build something!
Aha. Take that!
Unless your instincts are terrible.
No! The wheel!
I can't control it much longer!
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
Um...
VITRUVIUS: We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
We need to attach the wheel to
something that spins around.
We need to attach the wheel to
something that spins around.
Something that spins around.
Spins around. Spins around.
Oh.
WYLDSTYLE:
Emmet, where are you going?
Oh, this better work.
Hang tight!
SHERIFF: Dagnabit!
VITRUVIUS: Well done, Emmet.
Hey! I did it.
Wow. You actually did it.
WYLDSTYLE: Train!
WYLDSTYLE: Oh, no.
Get off my train.
WYLDSTYLE: Run!
EMMET: Wyldstyle!
Owie!
He's gonna ram us.
Quick, quick, quick! That piece!
Give me that piece.
BAD COP: Huh?
WYLDSTYLE: Build a ramp!
What the heck?
Rest in pieces.
- Uh...
- Oh, no.
Wait. No, no, no.
Hey.
Thanks for saving
my life back there.
Even if, you know...
eventually it turned
out to be pointless.
Well, for what it's worth...
this has been about the
greatest 15 minutes of my life.
What the...?
Relax, everybody, I'm here.
Batman!
- What's up, babe?
- WYLDSTYLE: Babe!
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.
Emmet, this is my
boyfriend, Batman.
I'm Batman.
That's your boyfriend? Aah!
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?
It's actually a funny
story, right, Bat?
BAD COP: There he is.
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.
- Batman!
The pleasure...
is all "spine."
Guess what...
you big dumb baby.
Your car is a baby carriage.
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.
- BATMAN: Hey, babe.
- What?
Let's hold hands.
So, uh...
Hey, guys, I think we're
about to crash into the sun.
BATMAN: Yeah, but it's
gonna look really cool.
EMMET: Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland?
I don't see any clouds.
- Or cuckoos.
- No, no, this is...
Middle Zealand.
A wondrous land...
torture weapons, poverty,
leeches, illiteracy...
and, um...
Dragon!
VITRUVIUS: Yeah, that too.
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland,
we'll raise an army...
of MasterBuilders to...
Anyway, you guys gotta check out
these new subwoofers I installed.
I call them the dogs.
Listen to them bark!
EMMET: Can you turn
that down a little bit?
This is a song I
wrote for Wyldstyle.
It's about how I'm an orphan.
This is real music, Emmet.
Batman's a true artist.
Dark, brooding.
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.
Guys, look, a rainbow.
VITRUVIUS: So you're gonna
drive up the curved part...
take it all the way to the top...
and park the car.
Friends, welcome to Cloud
Cuckooland. Now...
I just need to give
the secret knock.
Okay.
I'm just gonna come right out.
I have no idea what's going on,
or what this place is at all.
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...
and I welcome you all
to Cloud Cuckooland.
EMMET:
There's no signs or anything.
How does anyone know
what not to do?
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...
there are no rules.
There's no government...
no babysitters...
no bedtimes...
no frowny faces...
no bushy mustaches...
and no negativity of any kind.
You just said the word "no"
like a thousand times.
And there's also no consistency.
I hate this place.
Any idea is a good idea...
except the not happy ones.
Those you push down deep inside...
where you'll never, ever, ever...
ever...
find them.
Your fellow MasterBuilders
are gathered in the Dog.
The what?
Ah! Is that Superman?
Girl, what are you doing?
- Hey, Superman!
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- Lantern. Green Lantern.
- Yeah, yeah.
GREEN LANTERN: You wanna sit
together at the meeting?
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.
GREEN LANTERN:
Didn't Krypton blow up?
My fellow MasterBuilders,
including but not limited to...
Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...
Gandalf...
Swamp Creature...
- ...1980-something Space Guy...
- Hello!
- ...and Wonder Woman.
- Unh!
You have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import.
We have learned...
that Lord Business
plans to unleash...
a fully weaponized Kragle...
on Taco Tuesday...
to end the world as we know it.
Please, calm yourselves.
Green Ninja...
Milhouse...
Nice Vampire...
Michelangelo, Michelangelo...
and Cleopatra.
There is yet one hope.
The Special has arisen.
Have the young man step forward.
As you wish, Dubbledore.
I'm Gandalf!
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore."
- Dubbadore?
No, "Dumbledore."
Thought you said "Dubbadore."
Vitruvius!
You gotta write that down. I'm
not gonna remember any of it.
But here we go.
The Special will now
give an eloquent speech.
Go ahead, man. You got this.
Okay.
Hello. I'm Emmet.
Oh, and this is the
Piece of Resistance.
Thank you.
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...
am very excited to
work with you guys...
to get into the Octan
Tower, find the Kragle...
and put this thing on the thing.
And I know it's going to
be really hard, but...
"Really hard"?
Wiping ye bum with a hook
for a hand is really hard.
This be impossible.
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business' office...
we used every plan
we could conceive.
The result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of.
Who are you?
The name be Metal Beard.
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.
Oh, great, here we go again.
I arrived...
with me hearty
MasterBuilder crew...
only to find the Kragle was all the
way up on the infinityeth floor...
And there be a mysterious
room called the Think Tank.
Okay.
I had to replace every part
of my once-strapping...
virile pirate body...
with this useless hunk of
garbage ye see before ye.
So if ye think it'd be a
good idea to return...
to that forsaken place...
Special...
what idea have ye that be better...
than the ideas of 100...
of our fallen
MasterBuilder brothers?
Well, uh...
Well, technically I'm not
exactly a MasterBuilder yet.
What?
Please! Everyone! Please!
Rubbish!
Yes, it's true.
I may not be a MasterBuilder.
I may not have a lot
of experience...
fighting or leading or
coming up with plans.
Or having ideas in general.
In fact, I'm not all that smart.
And I'm not what you'd
call a "creative type."
Plus...
generally unskilled.
Also...
scared and cowardly.
I know what you're thinking:
"He is the least
qualified person...
in the world to lead us."
And you are right.
This is supposed to
make us feel better?
No, there was about to be a "but."
- You're a butt!
- Yes.
You all be on your own!
I be leaving this lost cause!
Why are you leaving?
A house divided against
itself would be better...
than this.
EMMET: Abraham Lincoln!
You bring your space
chair right back here!
Come on, guys!
We can still do this. Right?
MAN 1:
You're not even a bit special.
Well, you were right about
him being a ding-dong.
MAN 2:
You're a huge disappointment.
MAN 3: Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.
Well, at least it
can't get any worse.
I was wrong.
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!
BAD COP:
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.
Whoa. How did he...?
WYLDSTYLE: Go! Run! Come on,
everyone! Protect The Special.
What's that on his ankle?
It's a tracking device.
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.
Oh, he led them right to us.
Guys, no, no, no.
It's not my fault.
You are the worst leader I've
ever seen. To the Batmobile!
Dang it.
To the invisible jet!
- Dang it!
- Every man for himself.
No, we must protect the Piece.
Shaq, do you know what time...
- ...it is?
- It's game time.
Y'all ready for this?
Oh, no! They were ready for that.
It didn't break!
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!
Fire!
No!
Aah! I can't move!
Don't worry, Superman.
- I'll get you out of there.
- No! Don't!
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck.
My legs are stuck as well.
I super hate you.
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
- Babe...
help me get him out of here.
I said "every man for himself."
Hey, you gotta be there for me.
Fine!
Fine. Fine. Fine.
- I need you to have a better attitude.
- I have a great...
- ...attitude.
- Ouch.
BAD COP: The Special's in
the northwest quadrant.
We've got him cornered.
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.
Where'd he go?
UNIKITTY: Oh, no!
They've hit our silly
cloud stabilizers!
Let's go! We need to
get Emmet out of here.
EMMET: Can't we build something?
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.
I can build a spaceship. Watch.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship
Spaceship, spaceship
No! You can't.
The skies are surrounded.
That's okay. I didn't
really wanna build...
a spaceship anyway. That's cool.
Where can we go where
we can't be found?
Maybe we could go underwater?
What if we went underwater?
Great idea, babe!
Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.
But I just said that.
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.
With rainbows!
And dream catchers, in
case we take a nap.
Like an underwater spaceship!
But you can't build
all of them at once.
ALL: Ready? Break.
Okay.
These are the colors I need:
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!
If anybody has black parts,
I need them, okay?
I only work in black.
And sometimes, very,
very dark gray.
- Use the yellow bricks!
- Hey, guys, can I help?
- UNIKITTY: No! It has to be this way!
- WYLDSTYLE: No, I need that!
Where is he?
Anyone know what this
is, and do you need it?
I think we could use wings
and rocket boosters.
Ew. Get your retro space
stuff out of my area.
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly
what to do. And how to do it.
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.
You must embrace what
is special about you!
There he is!
All units, attack the sub!
WYLDSTYLE: Emmet, get in here!
BAD COP: Stop him!
Stop him! Don't let him...
get to the water!
WYLDSTYLE:
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!
We're going under!
Oh, no.
My home.
It's gone.
I feel something inside.
It's like the opposite
of happiness.
I must stay positive.
Ah. Bubble gums.
Butterflies.
Cotton candy.
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?
What the heck is that?
It's a double-decker couch.
Which seemed like a good
idea at the time...
but I now realize it's
not super helpful.
But, you know, it has cup holders.
Seats flip up with
coolers underneath.
You are so disappointing
on so many levels.
- Why are my pants cold and wet?
- Ew.
VITRUVIUS: Uh...
The walls are crying!
We're coming apart at the seams!
This is not how Batman dies.
Emmet!
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!
WYLDSTYLE: Deep breath!
Deep breath, everybod...!
Micro-managers, what's
going on down there?
MICRO-MANAGER:
Scanning submarine wreckage.
No survivors detected.
Scuba cops, dredge the
entire ocean if you have to.
We have got to find that Piece.
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...
and give him the good news.
The Special is no more.
BUSINESS: Hello, everybody!
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
Greetings, all!
Welcome to my Think Tank.
MASTERBUILDERS: Help us!
All the MasterBuilders you've
captured over the years...
you've brought them here.
You're a very perceptive
person, Superman.
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.
Robots!
No! No! Grr!
Can't get much worse than this.
- GREEN LANTERN: Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.
It's Green Lantern.
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where is The Special?
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.
Wait, hold on.
A double-decker couch?
Yes, sir.
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?
That's weird.
If you're sitting in
the top middle...
how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?
If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...
are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?
Who's gonna want to
sit on the bottom?
the most useless idea
I have ever heard.
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!
Heh. The double-decker couch.
It wasn't totally
pointless after all.
It's the one thing
that stayed together.
I always believed in you, Emmet.
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?
I mean, it's not like a
big gigantic ship...
is gonna come out of
nowhere and save us...
My gosh!
Avast, mateys!
Metal Beard, I thought you
said we were a lost cause!
Ye are!
Did ye not hear me whole story...
circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.
So why did you come back?
This be-doubled land couch.
I watched Lord Business'
forces completely overlook it.
Which means we need
more ideas like it!
Oh, thank you.
Ideas so dumb and bad...
that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.
Oh. Thank you.
VITRUVIUS:
So, Special, what do we do?
Uh...
Well...
what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?
Build a spaceship?
Kill a chicken?
Marry a marshmallow.
Why, this:
How you gonna
keep 'em down on the farm?
No! It's follow the instructions.
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.
Now, listen. Wait, listen.
Guys, you're all so
talented and imaginative.
But you can't work
together as a team.
I'm just a construction worker.
But when I had a plan and we
were all working together...
I mean, we could
build a skyscraper.
Now, you're MasterBuilders.
Just imagine what could
happen if you did that.
You could save the universe.
Well said, Emmet. Well said.
Really?
She be a fine speech there, laddie.
Okay.
Somebody get me some markers...
some construction paper...
and some glitter glue!
I call this:
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...
put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...
...and save the world."
I've built a hundred just
like them back in the city.
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.
I can get us anywhere.
How will we get inside?
In a spaceship.
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.
No, they're expecting
us to show up...
in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.
One of those sounds awesome to me.
My idea is to build a spaceship...
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.
So not the special spaceship that I'm
building for all of you right now?
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.
Ooh, you're really letting the
oxygen out of my tank here.
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions...
this ship needs a hyperdrive.
We don't have that part.
Maybe we could find one!
What do you think, a spaceship is
just gonna appear out of the blue?
Are you kidding me?
The same thing!
- Chewie!
- Mm!
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!
This hyperdrive keeps
malfunctioning...
taking us to loser
systems like this.
Captain Solo, we must go.
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.
The Droid's right. Let's roll.
Now hold on, Han.
This might be the right
galaxy after all.
Because I see a heavenly body.
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!
If he's a cool dude like you.
You're trying to bail on us!
I'm not trying to bail!
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!
That thing is filled
with bon vivants.
You speak French now?
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...
I need to feel free to party...
with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.
What?
Babe!
I will text you.
LANDO: Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?
It's party time!
Babe?
Wyldstyle, you're such
an amazing person.
And, you know, if Batman can't
see that, then he's just...
Well, he's just as
blind as a guy...
whose eyes stopped working.
And I'm gonna tell you something:
Batman is the worst
person I've ever met.
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.
You really had me there!
Those guys were so lame. All they
did was play space checkers.
Plus, it turns out the
hairy one's a dude.
And the metal one too. All dudes.
But won't they notice their
hyperdrive is missing?
LANDO: Come on, Chewie,
hit the hyperdrive.
Nah, they'll be fine.
EMMET: Step one:
All right, we need a red
four-piece unit over at the...
Unikitty...
you're supposed to follow
the instructions, remember?
Sorry.
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.
BATMAN:
What do I even...? I can't...!
Nice!
We pilot the ship to the
service entrance...
Space ID.
I have a drive-on.
Who are you here to see?
I'm here to see Your Butt.
Is that last name "Butt," first
name "Your," or is it...?
Oh, my gosh!
BATMAN: Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.
First try!
EMMET: Step three: We break
into Lord Business' office...
and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises.
will sneak their way into
the master control room.
COMPUTER: Motion sensors
triggered in Sector 12.
ROBOT: 10-4.
Uh-oh.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh!
Do it.
Metal Beard, that was awesome!
First law of the sea...
never place your rear
end on a pirate's face.
EMMET: Once inside, they'll use
their technical know-how...
Cool! Talking computer.
Please disable the shield systems.
There are no movies in
your area with that title.
Vitruvius will provide lookout and
make sure we're not being followed.
VITRUVIUS: Okay.
EMMET: Step six: Batman and
Unikitty go into the boardroom...
to make one last change
to Lord Business' plan.
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that?
BRUCE: I second.
Bruce Wayne,
CEO of Wayne Enterprises.
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?
Sounds like a cool guy.
We'd like to invest
in your company.
Your weapon to control the
universe sounds super sweet...
- ...I must say.
- It is, indeed, super sweet.
Cool. What kind of sound
system does it have?
Uh, sound system? Well, I mean,
we have an iPod Shuffle.
Wait a second.
You're telling me you have a
machine to control the universe...
and you can't listen to
tunes in surround sound?
Embarrassing.
Well, I mean...
we need to get that done.
I want eight-foot speakers.
Great call.
Yeah, I want speakers that you can
hug with your arms and your legs...
and just feel the beat.
Listen up! We need new instructions
for a speaker system for the TAKOS.
We'll never help.
Whatever you say, boss.
EMMET: Then once the
instructions are printed...
Wyldstyle and I will
enter the Kragle room...
place the thing on
the other thing...
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't
draw that. Is that me exploding?
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?
When you reunite the Piece with
the Kragle, it might explode?
No! But it might not, right?
Sure, sure, sure.
Let's go with that.
COMMAND BOT: Attention, everybody!
Incoming speaker delivery!
Ow!
Who are you two?
We are transfers from downstairs.
- What?
- Excuse me?
Your robot voice
sounds an awful lot like a human voice.
Give me a break. I've never
been a robot before.
What do you mean? You
have always been a robot!
No, no, no, do not listen to her.
What are your robot serial numbers?
No way. This is my jam.
This is also my jam.
ROBOTS :
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
- Needs great harmonies.
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not...
ALL: Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
WYLDSTYLE :
Quick, let's go.
ROBOTS :
Everything is awesome
Hmm, I thought
you didn't like that song.
I don't.
EMMET: Mm-hm.
I know you put on this tough act...
but I don't think you're as
mean as you're trying to seem.
I'm not mean.
What are you talking about?
I'm just saying, you were all,
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius.
He can't possibly be The Special.
This guy? Are you kidding me?"
Anyways, I don't think that's you.
The real you, anyway.
Look, Emmet.
I wanted it to be me, okay?
I wanted to be The Special.
And I know that sounds
super mature. It's just...
ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the One.
I was right there in that
construction site...
That night in the city, when you
thought I was The Special...
and you said I was
talented and important...
that was the first time anyone
had ever really told me that.
And it made me wanna do
everything I could...
to be the guy you
were talking about.
Lucy.
What?
That was my real name.
You asked earlier, and it's...
Lucy.
I really like that name.
Hey.
- What are you two losers talking about?
- Huh? What? Oh, nothing.
Thought I'd help you guys.
Left the weird cat thing to stall.
Business, business, business.
Numbers.
-  Is this working?
- ROBOT: Yes.
Yay!
There's Bad Cop.
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes...
Okay. Wait for my signal.
Good luck, Emmet.
EMMET: Lucy.
I guess this might be goodbye.
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:
"See you later, alligator."
"See you later, alligator"?
After a while, crocodile.
Who's Lucy?
Batman, when
we get inside this room...
there are gonna be audio
sensors everywhere.
We have to be really, really quiet.
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb
instructions. Stop yelling at me.
Benny, what's our
status with the shield?
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.
It's just going great, if
somebody would listen to me!
Downloading latest episode
of Where Are My Pants?
BENNY : Where are you getting
"pants" from? You know what I want!
Bad Cop.
WYLDSTYLE :
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.
He would like you to come
to his office immediately.
BAD COP: Copy that.
- Thanks.
- You are welcome, sir.
ROBOT: Hey, who is that?
EMMET :
That's the signal...
but the shield is still up.
We'll wing it.
That's a bat pun.
Shh. Benny...
disable the shield.
- EMMET: Now.
Disable the shield.
- What?
- No! I never once said anything...!
Benny, what's going on?
You are undermining me!
Which phrase would you
like me to underline?
Disable the shield!
Let me try.
Be ye disabling of yon shield.
What?
Okay, in three...
two...
one.
Let's do this.
Lucy!
Lucy!
No!
Oh, man.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
Sneaking around the corner...
- Unh!
- Vitruvius.
I see you've accidentally
wandered into my Think Tank.
And by the way, I found
a few of your friends.
- By which I mean all of them!
- Sorry!
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.
Thank you, sir.
Robots, destroy this
old man at once.
Did you just call me "old"?
Yeah. So what?
Well, Junebug, I really
prefer the word...
"experienced"!
VITRUVIUS: Aha.
You see, Emmet?
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagina...
- Ha-ha-ha!
- EMMET: Vitruvius!
No!
Vitruvius.
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.
You must know something
about the prophecy.
I know, I'm doing my best...
but I don't...
The prophecy...
I made it up.
What?
I made it up. It's not true.
But that means I'm just...
I'm not The Special?
You must listen.
What I'm about to tell you...
will change the course of history.
No.
No.
BUSINESS: Hey.
Not so special anymore, huh?
Well, guess what.
No one ever told me I was special.
I never got a trophy
just for showing up!
I'm not some special
little snowflake...
no.
But as unspecial as I am...
you are a thousand-billion times...
more unspecial than me.
Robots, bring me the
Sword of Exact Zero.
ROBOTS: Yes, Lord Business.
BUSINESS: It must be weird.
One minute, you're the most
special person in the universe.
And the next minute, you're nobody.
Oh, I have a nice spot for
this in my relic room.
Uh-oh! My mistake!
There it goes!
No!
BUSINESS: Bye-bye forever!
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do!
Release the Kragle!
- Computer!
- Yes, sir.
BUSINESS: Set the electric
shocker to 100 Mississippi.
- Then terminate everyone.
- Already on it.
Emmet, that should give
you enough time...
to witness the first
location to be Kragled.
- Your hometown.
- No!
BUSINESS: Bad Cop, unfortunately, I'm
gonna have to leave you here to die.
What? Sir.
It's not personal.
It's just business.
COMPUTER:
Beginning zapping termination...
BUSINESS :
Attention, everyone.
- Whoa.
BUSINESS:
Don't worry about this big black...
monolith thing that's
blocking out the sun.
is this question that
I'm about to ask you:
Who wants a taco?
Tacos, tacos!
We're going crazy! Yeah.
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"
So I guess running around
and screaming is normal.
Micro-managers, commence
micro-management.
MICRO-MANAGER:
Commencing micro-management.
MAN 1 :
What's going on? I can't move!
MAN 2 : Please, please!
Won't somebody help us?
BENNY: Emmet, you'll think of
something, right? Like you always do.
Didn't you hear him?
The prophecy's made-up.
I'm not The Special.
And to think for a moment
I thought I might be.
- VITRUVIUS: Emmet.
- Who said that?
VITRUVIUS: I did.
I am Ghost Vitruvius.
Woo!
Emmet, you didn't let
me finish earlier.
Because I died.
The reason I made
up the prophecy...
was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...
could become The Special.
Because the only thing anyone
needs to be special...
is to believe that you can be.
I know that sounds like a
cat poster, but it's true.
Look at what you did when you
believed you were special.
You just need to
believe it some more.
But how can I just decide to
believe that I'm special...
when I'm not?
VITRUVIUS:
Because the world depends on it.
Woo!
Zapping termination
in 35 Mississippi...
What?
WYLDSTYLE: Emmet!
What are you...?
- EMMET: Oh!
- Lucy!
- Wait! What are you...?
Now it's your turn to be the hero.
- No!
See you later, alligator.
Don't!
No, Emmet!
- Aah!
WYLDSTYLE: Emmet!
No.
He... He saved us.
Well, what do we do now?
There's gotta be a bright side...
here somewhere.
Does anyone have any ideas?
Emmet had ideas.
Arr, if only there were more
people in the world like he.
Maybe there are.
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.
Honey, where are my...
pant...?
- Hi!
- WYLDSTYLE: Hey, guess what.
Found your pants.
Series is over. Benny...
send this out to everyone
in the universe.
Now you're talking!
You don't know me, but I'm
on TV, so you can trust me.
I know things seem
kind of bad right now.
And he was just like all of you.
following the same
instructions as you.
He was so good at fitting
in, no one ever saw him.
because I used to look
down on people like that.
"I used to think they
were followers...
with no ideas or vision."
WYLDSTYLE: Because it turns
out Emmet had great ideas.
And even though they
seemed weird...
than anyone else to
saving the universe.
And now we have to finish
what he started...
by making whatever weird
thing pops into our heads.
All of you have the ability inside
of you to be a groundbreaker.
We need to fight back against
President Business'...
Today will not be known
as Taco Tuesday.
But still on a Tuesday!
End of the line.
Bad Cop?
I hope there's still a
Good Cop in me somewhere.
I'll hold these guys off.
You go stop them. Yay!
Great idea, but how
will we get there?
- I could, uh...
- I could build a...
I could build a spaceship!
You're not gonna say no?
Build away, whatever your name is.
- Whoa! Yay!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
All units, attack that spaceship.
Spaceship!
Where'd he go?
BENNY: Spaceship!
UNIKITTY: Wyldstyle, look...
it's the citizens!
KNIGHT: Tallyho!
COWBOYS: Yee-haw!
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.
BUSINESS: What is going on?
You stop...
building that stuff!
Just stop it!
MAN: Great job!
This might actually work.
'Twas your speech which
roused this hearty crew.
If only Emmet were
here to see this.
He'd say something adorable like...
EMMET: Am I just gonna keep...
falling...
forever?
FINN:
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!
- Pew!
Hi, Emmet.
What happened?
No, no, no, this is a disaster.
Why...? Why...? What? What?
What?
Why is the dragon on top of
the luxury condo development?
But I was just playing...
I know it's hard to understand...
but this is Dad's stuff, okay?
All of this that you
see before you...
is all your father's.
And everything is
thought-out very...
What did you do down here?
Did you take the top
off of the tower?
It was an accident.
You accidentally...
expertly...
carefully took the entire
top off of that tower?
Yes.
You know the rules.
This isn't a toy.
- Um, well, it kind of is.
- No.
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.
- But we bought it at the toy store.
- We did.
But the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.
The box for this one
said ages 8 to 14.
That's a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.
FINN: You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this.
You have your stuff over near
the Christmas decorations.
All those bricks, you can
build anything you want.
Finn, we're gonna play a
little game. It's called:
"Let's Put Everything Back
the Way You Found it."
But, Dad, you don't understand.
So I can make things the way
they're supposed to be.
Permanently.
This rebellion ends right now.
MICRO-MANAGER: Commencing...
micro-management.
TRUCK DRIVER: Oh, no. No!
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!
Wait, what's happening?
No, wait! No, we're going
down! Mayday!
JEFF: Meow. Meow.
Hold on, Jeff.
We're coming for you!
No!
Arr, there be too
many Micro-managers!
MAN UPSTAIRS:
What am I holding here?
- It's a battleship.
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.
What's Batman doing on it?
What is this, a robot pirate?
Dang it.
EMMET: Stop! Stop it!
No! Stop it! Stop!
You got glue all over
that construction worker.
Here. Give that to me.
All of those are my
friends! No, stop it!
METAL BEARD:
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...
It be over.
EMMET: No!
Let's get this gunk off
this construction worker.
He's not just a construction
worker, Dad. He's the hero.
MAN UPSTAIRS: Nope, he's not.
He is a ordinary, regular...
generic construction worker...
and I need to put him
back where he belongs.
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?
EMMET: I gotta get the
Piece of Resistance.
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature...
Where is that?
All right.
Now, I didn't move...
- FINN: Uh, Dad?
- Yeah.
FINN: I think I saw the X-Acto
over there near Middle Zealand.
Oh, great. Thank you.
Welcome.
It's up to you now, Emmet.
VITRUVIUS: I know that
sounds like a cat poster...
Sorry, street.
Ho-ho!
I can see everything.
Ha, ha!
What the heck is this?
I am a MasterBuilder.
Release every
Micro-manager we have!
Let's get him, fellas!
Hey, everyone!
- Emmet!
- Emmet! Yay!
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.
You've got it, Emmet.
EMMET: Take that! Ha, ha!
Good night! Come here!
We'll help you out, kid.
Here's how we do it pirate-style!
Yes! Emmet! That's it!
MICRO-MANAGER: Take him down, boys!
Emmet!
Stay positive.
They're tearing me apart!
Stay positive.
Come on!
Oh, forget it!
You all need to be more friendly!
Emmet, go!
Go! Now's your...
- chance!
- METAL BEARD: She's right!
- You can do it, me laddie!
- BATMAN: Go on, kid. Get in there!
Sir, we got an intrud...!
EMMET: Lord Business.
Back from the dead, Brickowski?
Well, you're too late!
Skeletrons, get him!
Argh! I can't move!
You see, your friends...
The last thing I need
to do is finish...
- ...you.
- No, stop! Please!
If you do one more thing, I'm
gonna unleash my secret weapon.
Your secret weapon?
Yes, it's called:
The Power of The Special.
That sounds dumb.
All right, here it comes.
My secret weapon...
is this.
What is that? Is it super small?
I don't see anything.
It's my hand. I want
you to take it.
You want me to take your hand off?
No, I want you to join me.
Look at all of these
things that people built.
You might see a mess...
Exactly. And a bunch of
weird, dorky stuff...
that ruined my
perfectly good stuff!
Okay. What I see...
are people inspired
by each other...
Finn, did you make all of this?
The people are trying to
stop President Business...
from using the Kragle.
What's the Kragle?
Um, it's in there.
In here?
So President Business
is the bad guy?
If...
If the construction guy...
said something to
President Business...
what would he say?
You...
don't have to be...
the bad guy.
You...
are the most talented...
most interesting...
and most extraordinary
person in the universe.
And you are capable
of amazing things...
because you are The Special.
And so am I.
It's about all of us.
Right now, it's about you.
And you...
still...
can change everything.
Oh, we got a hugger.
Be careful.
I have been told it might explode.
Phew.
Emmet, thank you.
And I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...
from this moment forward...
I solemnly promise
that I will never...
ALL: Emmet!
Hey, everyone! Is everyone okay?
Where's Lucy?
Emmet!
EMMET: Lucy!
We did it.
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.
Batman, there's something
I need to say to you.
No. Wyldstyle...
I mean...
Lucy.
He's the hero you deserve.
- BENNY: Uh...
- Thanks, Batman.
VITRUVIUS:
I liked Emmet before it was cool.
Whoops, I have the
antidote for the Kragle.
How did that happen?
Yay!
- De-Kragler.
- MAN UPSTAIRS: Watch this.
- Yay!
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy.
You're okay!
- Oh, son!
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
WOMAN: Guys, time to come up for dinner.
It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.
- Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!
- I gotta tell you something.
- FINN: What?
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play...
guess who else gets to
come down here and play?
- Who?
- Your sister.
What?
Well, things sure have a way
of working out smoothly.
Am I right, guys?
What?
We're from the Planet Duplon.
We are here to destroy you.
Oh, man.
You get it. That's
just the first verse.
