Stop

No he didn't
Where is my son?

A strange thing happens when you
are making a work of art
Don't quite see the elements come together
and then when it all comes together
there is something magical, or something
organic, such a thing happened today
And everyone said this wouldn't work
They said it was a terrible risk but I wanna
keep on making films just like this
The video film combination it's something that's realy
been done before but not quite like this
I am glad the reception was so great
and I am just happy to be here
Vive La France
Bless you
Come and see what I made
