Thank you.
I wish they all could be California girls
I wish they all could be California girls
The beach boys are dope. I love beach boys.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, ladies, how you doin' ?  Wait a minute.
Hey, where you goin' ?  Let's get some sushi !
Hey ! Hey, Cutie !  Ah.
I wish they all could--
Hey, hey, hey, hey ! That was my CD.
Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off ?  They was laughing at us.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them to have a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Which word was "goat" ?
You owe me a copy of the beach boys' greatest hits.
Don't be gettin' no attitude with me, Lee.
I been here three days and ain't done nothin' but work your cases.
Only reason why I'm here in Hong Kong is  'cause you said you was gonna show me a good time.
I'm on vacation, man, and I want some mu shu.
- Mu shu ?  You hungry ? - No, Lee, not mu shu.
Some mu shu. I wanna see some women, man.
Now stop playin' dumb and show me to the shu.
What was that ?
Did you just take another damn case on my vacation, man ?
Of course not. My superintendent invited us to a club.
Big party tonight.  -Don't be messin' with me, Lee.
I will slap you so hard, you'll end up in the Ming dynasty.
I mean it, man.  I'll bitch-slap you back to Bangkok.
- Big party ? - Big one.
Okay, well, let's go party then.
Hey, this is nice.  Hey, Cutie.
They don't like tourists in here,  so try to blend in.
What do you mean, blend in ? I'm two feet taller than everybody in here.
Wait here. Where you goin' ?
Bathroom.  -Hurry back, man, 'cause we gonna party.
Ah, yeah !
How you doin' ?
Come here a lot ? It's a nice place.

Get off the stage. Are you crazy, man ?
I'm a star ! I'm a god to these people. Come check this out.
This is a gangster bar. We are here undercover.
I knew you was lyin'. I knew you was lyin', man.
I'm sorry, Carter. -You a liar !
We are here to find Ricky Tan.  We must tread softly.
Tread softly ? What in the world you talkin' about ?
Who taught you how to roust a bar ?  "Tread softly."
These men are triads, the most deadly gang in China.
You think that scare me ? I'm from Los Angeles. We invented gangs.
Give me that badge. No ! You are civilian !
In Hong Kong, I am Michael Jackson !  You are toto !
You mean tito ! Toto is what we ate last night for dinner.
Now give me that badge.  Give it-- no !
Okay, listen up !
Right now !
What did I just say ?
You just asked everybody to pick up their samurai swords...
and shave your butt.
I said that ?  Yes.
Come out here and translate this for me.  Come on.
All right, listen up !
All the triads and the ugly women on this side,
and all the fine women on this side right now !
Translate it.
Okay, y'all gonna act like y'all don't hear what I'm sayin'.
All right, who in here know Ricky Tan ?  Raise your hand.
Translate.
I see what's goin' on here.
Okay.  I ain't got time to be playin' no games now.
Hu Li ! I'm takin' everybody--
Hey, Lee !

- Huh ? - Behind you !
What ? aah !
Who the hell was that ?
Lord Jesus, I don't wanna die !
Lee, help me, man !
Don't worry. Chinese bamboo is very strong.
aah ! aah !
You sure, man ?  I'm sure.
aah ! aah !  Lee !
aah !  aah !
aah !
- aah ! - Let go !  Let go !
I can't believe I flew 10,000 miles for this shit !
I can't believe you lied to me, man.
I'm sorry.  You sorry ?
I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck up my ass,
and all you gotta say to me is you sorry ?
- There was an explosion. - I don't give a damn !
at the American  embassy. Two American s were killed.
So you think this guy Ricky Tan blew up the embassy ?
- I don't know. - Well, why the hell are you lookin' for him then ?
We're gonna find out.   No, you gonna  find out, man.
There's two billion Chinese people here.  Let one of them be your partner.
Where the hell we at now ?
Massage parlor. Heaven on earth.
Now this is more like it.
I'm about to go in here and get a massage...
and a hot tea bath right now.
Just follow my lead. Act like a tourist.
I am a tourist, fool.
hey !
Slow down, Chen ! Hell is wrong with you ?
...girl.
Yeah. My American friend is on vacation.
-I want to show him a good time. -Oh, you American .
- Yeah. - You bring American money ?
I got it, Lee.  I got it. No.
You sure ?  I'm sure.
Thank you.  You're welcome.
Right this way, gentlemen.
Are you ready ?
You ready ? I'm ready.
Oh, my goodness !
This place is off the hook ! I love Hong Kong.
You get massage from Chinese girl before ?
No, but I heard it was the bomb.
Come with me.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Any girl ?  Any girl.
Okay.
I don't know where to start.
I'll take that one right there. She got to come. -Oh, yes, she's very nice.
She is nice, but I hurt my back and my neck,  and I need a little bit more massage.
You know ?  So I'm gonna take her in the pink too.
Oh, yes. -And let me get her. Hey, baby.
and let me have her. Can I get her too ?
and her right there. She good with feet ?
Oh, yes. -What are you doing ?
She said I could have any girl I want in here.  -Well, hurry up !
Man, what's wrong with you ? You don't jump in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Calm down !  I have to-- your friend has big appetite.
Please, follow her upstairs into the quiet room.
It ain't gonna be no quiet room  no more.
in a--  oh.
Y'all don't know how good this feels.
I got in a big fight last night with the triads.
Y'all ever heard of the triads?  I beat down like 20 of 'em.
Y'all should've seen me.It was on.   Oh.
Lee !  Lee !  Yeah ?
This is what I'm talkin' about, man.  Now I'm on vacation.
I knew you'd come through.  I just knew it.
America ?
Wanna come to America with me ?  Ever been to America ?
Lee, how's your girl ?
Lee, what's wrong ?  That's Ricky Tan.
That's Ricky Tan ?  That's a midget in a bathrobe !
- I will call for backup. - The man is four feet tall. Let's go bust him right now.
No.   No ?
- He's a very dangerous man. - I'm a very dangerous man.
Look, let's go over there and bust him, man.
You're not about to mess up my massage,  I'm telling you right now.
- Stay here. - You don't need backup.   I got your back--
Excuse me for a minute. Just for a minute.
I'll be back.  Don't--
I'll be back. psst.
Ricky ?  Ricky Tan ?
Get up, dog.  Let's go. I've been lookin' for you everywhere.
I'm busy at the moment.
Did you hear what I said ? I'm busy too. Now get on your feet.
- Get up !  Get on your feet ! - I know you.
You are Lee's American  friend, right ?  No.
I'm Lee's new muscle. Don't let this robe fool you.
This is the only color they had left.  Now I said, get up.
I ain't gonna say it again.
You American are so funny.
And you Asians don't hear that well.
Little Ricky !
Get your little punk ass up...
Outta that chair right now !
You're messin' up my vacation. Now, I told you to get up, didn't I ?
Now I gotta go off on you.  No !
Let me bust his ass, Lee.  Lee.
Let me take care of this.
Look, little man. You comin' with--
Oh, my lord.
I would like to pay you for that laptop.
I think I should do that.  No problem.
I can get you a new one. I seen it on the internet, with a DVD player.
That's an old model. Now, I must excuse myself.
Inspector.
Have a good day.
I was--
Lee, why didn't you tell me this man rolls like this ?
I told you already !  -No, you didn't !
What you said ? - I did this.
What do this mean ? Speak English to me !
That means I go this way and you go this way.
I go that way, you go this way ? - Yes.
Okay.
Ooh ! Carter ! Sorry, man.
All y'all look alike ! Watch out !
- Carter ! - Lee !
Oh ! No wonder you mad.
Don't worry. It's okay.
You better get the hell outta here.
Oh !
Lee !
- Flip me ! - What ?
Flip me !
Damn !
Lee ! Oh !
aah !
No !  no !  no !  no !
oh.
Lee !
Look, you've been ordered by the ministry of public security...
to assist the F.B.I. and secret service in our investigation,
to provide us with whatever we need.
you have information, it belongs to us.
This is still Hong Kong.
Two Americans have been killed on United States government property.
Give me two copies of that.
This is our investigation.
Chief inspector Lee will supervise your people.
No, he will report to me.
Do we understand each other ?
What the hell is that ?
That is, uh, chief inspector Lee.
I ain't never been humiliated  and embarrassed like that...
in my whole entire life.
Got me runnin' around Hong Kong butt-naked,  thanks to you.
Thanks to me ?  Yeah, thanks to you.
You needed backup, so I gave you backup.
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass,  and his bodyguards', till you messed it up.
- Stop.  I'm sick of your bullshit.  - I'm sick of you !
I'm not the one runnin' up  in karaoke bars full of gangsters.
and I'm not the one runnin' up  in massage parlors lookin' for crime lords.
- It's my job. - It's your job.
You pitiful, man. When are you gonna have some fun ?
When are you gonna take a day off ?   When are you gonna go on a date ?
- I have plenty of dates. - When's the last time   you had a date ?
When's the last time you played  "hide the rainbow roll" ?
Huh ?  Let's hear it, Lee. The year of the rat ?
You will never understand me.
You right, 'cause I didn't even understand what you just said to me right then.
They got my passport back at that massage parlor.
Good afternoon, sir.
Lee ? -Yes, sir.
This is special agent sterling from the United States secret service.
Secret service ? Why ?
Have a seat, please.
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
The men who were killed yesterday  were not American translators.
They were undercover United States customs agents,
trying to break a triad smuggling ring.
Smuggling what ?  We don't know.
But whatever it is, it got the agents killed.
How can we help you ?
You can stay the hell out of our way.
- Thank you. - I can get you Ricky Tan.
No.  We know all about Tan.
That's why we're leaving him out there as bait.
This is a lot bigger than Ricky Tan...
and the Fu Cang Long triads.
Hey, Cutie.
Thank you, Lee.
Carter !  Carter !
Uh, Heaven on Earth massage parlor ?
Heaven on Earth ?
hello.  Cheap suits.
Hello.  Cheap suits. Cheap suits.
Cheap suits.  Cheap suits. How cheap ?
Cheap suits. Cheap as hell ?
Excuse me. Can you direct me...
To Heaven on Earth massage parlor, please ?
Hello. How are you ?  Okay.
No, no. Wait a minute.
-  - I don't want no chicken.
No, no, no.
aah !   No !
I don't want no chicken. What am I gonna do with a chicken ?
I don't like my chickens live, okay ?
I like 'em dead and deep-fried. You ever heard of popeye's ?
No, no !  No !  Don't kill chicken.
Oh. Yes.  aah !
I'm warning you. I'm a police officer.
Put the blade down and let the bird go right now !
You okay, Lee ?
All he wanted was some mu shu.
Damn.
Hey, taxi ! Taxi !
Hey !  Hey !
Follow that car.
Hey, follow that limo. This is a chase, okay ? Wherever he goes, you go.
You're not movin' !  this is the opposite of chasin' !
What ?
I will slap you if you don't move this car.
I'm gonna slap you. I'm gonna slap you.
Okay.  All right.  Okay, look.  Here.
You understand that ?
Now you're speaking my language. - Get the hell on then.
Come on, Let's go !
yeah, this right here, tell you what,
goes out to everyone...
that has lost someone  that they truly love.
Come on, check it out.
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I lay the track you lock the flow
We're so far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious.  They got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
even though you're gone we still a team
Do your family job, fulfill your dreams
In the future can't wait to see
reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
I try to black it out but it plays again
Wait right here. I'll be right back.
You understand ?  Yes, I understand !
And don't eat my chicken, okay ?  Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay. Jesus !
Hey !  hey !
How you doin', baby ? Carter, James Carter. Baldwin hills.
Isabella Molina. From San Juan.
San Juan ? I know San Juan. Mm-hmm.
I've traveled there many times on my private plane.
You must know my good friend Pedro Morales Magonzales Marato Molaso Mondustos.
I don't think so, no.  -You sure ?
Well, I'm sorry. I thought you rode in the best of circles.
But listen. Make yourself feel at home.
You need anything--champagne, caviar- -My yacht is your yacht.
This is your yacht ?
That's right. I'm the owner.
The captain. El Capitan.
El captain ?  Yes. Listen.
I'm not gonna play games with you.  I want you right now.
I see me and you downstairs in one of those bathrooms...
in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht.
What's it called ?
What's it called ?  -Mm-hmm. Your yacht.
The S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minnow Johnson ?  -Yeah.
Funny. The name on the back was the Red Dragon.
The Red Dragon ? Are you sure ?
Oh, I'm sure. Because this is my friend's yacht.
Your friend's yacht ? And this is his party.
I must've got on the wrong yacht.  All these yachts look just alike these days.
I knew somethin' was wrong when my key didn't work.
Who's your friend ? Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.
Hey, wait a second. I know you. Steven Reign, right ?
You own half of Los Angeles. What you doin' out here in Hong Kong ?
I'm here for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You must have your own plane too.  It's fun, ain't it ?
Shall we ?
Yes.
Well, enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.
I plan to, Ms. Isabella.
See you later, Stevie. Be cool.
Ricky Tan. Where is he ?  -I don't know !
He killed a detective today.  Where is he ?
Who got killed, man ?
- Carter ! - Who died, Lee ?
- You ! - Detective Yu ?
- Not Yu, you !  - Who ?
- You ! - Who ?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ?
Don't nobody understand the words that are comin' out of your mouth, man.
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.
What the hell is going on here, Lee ?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman ?  -Yeah.
Ricky Tan was his partner.  -What ?
Lee, I've been expecting you.
Please ask your partner to wait inside.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' nowhere.  -It's okay.
I'm not leavin' you alone, Lee.  -I'll be fine.
You sure ?  -Yes.
I'll be right upstairs.
I know what everybody's saying.
I did not blow up the American embassy.
I'm not that stupid.
But I believe some of my people did.
My enemies are trying to frame me.
There is a war going on right now within the triads.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this time.
If your father were still alive, I would turn to him for advice.
Please don't.
Lee, I really need your help. I cannot trust anybody else.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
I'll give you all the information you need,
But you've gotta get me out of Hong Kong right away.
- Whoa ! - Huh ?
whoa !
Hey, lady, what are you doin' ?
Get down. I'm L.A..P.D.
You just kick me ? You must be outta your mind !
You want some of me ? I'm gonna give you an L.A..P.D. ass-kickin' !
aah !
You okay ?  Yeah.
I slipped and I fell.  Hey.
What ? Am I bleedin' ?
Quite a night, inspector.
Ricky Tan was our only bait. Now he's gone.
So you got your revenge--at the expense of a United States government investigation.
What are you talkin' about, revenge ?
Now, I don't know if the triads paid you to get rid of Tan...
or if it was a pure vendetta killing...
or if you're involved in the smuggling yourself,  but you're off this case.
I don't ever wanna see you again.  Is that clear ?
Hey, what's goin' on here ? - Carter, you're in enough trouble.
Just shut up. Stay out of it.
You're goin' back to L.A..  Right now.
That's fine with me, man. I ain't had fun since I been out here.
Okay.
Sorry, Lee.
- Escort detective Carter to the airport.  - No.
I'll take him. Get your hands off !
Carter, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right.
I got knocked off a building,  I got beat on,
I got stripped butt-naked, and you held out on me, man.
I'm outta here.
Carter, Ricky Tan set up my father.
What ?
Five years ago, my father was working  a big international smuggling case.
He found out his partner, Tan, was working for the triads.
But before he could prove it, he was killed.
All the evidence disappeared,
Tan resigned, and the case was never solved.
So I get it now. This is all about your daddy's last case.
So you gettin' on the plane with me or not ?
What ? You know my daddy died on the job too.
If I had a chance to square his death,  I'd do whatever it took.
I'd do anything. so you comin' or what ?
Why L.A.. ?
Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's theory of criminal investigation:
follow the rich white man.
Follow the rich white man ?  -Exactly. Now you're learning.
Every big crime has a rich white man  behind it waitin' for his cut.
Now in our case, we know who the rich white man is.
Steven Reign.  -Who ?
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.  I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.
When the shootin' started, he was way too cool.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'. when people start shootin', white people ain't that cool.
they either runnin' around, hidin' behind tables, or screamin' like, "aah !"
- Shh ! - You sound like that all the time.
Let me tell you somethin' about black people.
When stuff goes down, we keep our cool.
-Maybe, but not like Asians, we never panic. - Yeah, right.
When godzilla's comin', y'all be trippin'.
I seen the movie. you be, "gaica, gaica !" -Carter.
yellin' everywhere. I seen Chinamen-- just--
Mr. Carter, excuse me. -Thank you so much.  It's the kosher meal ?
Yes, sir, that is.  -Our kosher meal. Shalom.
There he is, right there.
Mr. Steven Reign, livin' large in one of his penthouse suites.
Oh, guess who this is. Yep, that's her.
That's the woman that was on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.
We got 'em.
Told you it'd work out. Know what I'm talkin' about.
All we gotta do now is wait.
They still talkin' ?  Hmm.
He's leaving.
- He'll be back. - How do you know ?
I know.  You see how fine that woman is ?
He'll definitely be back.
- What's she doing ? - uh--
What's she doin', man ?
She's just standing around, not doing much.
Well, just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later, something's gonna happen.
Okay, I just try to stay awake. It's just so boring.
Oh.  Slow down, baby.
- What ? - Huh ?
- Nothing.  I said nothing. - You said somethin'.
- I said nothing. - I heard you say somethin'.
N-n-no. noth-nothing.
ah.
Lee, what's goin' on, man ? What you talkin' about ?
She's getting undressed. - What ?
She's just getting undressed.  -Give me that !
No ! It's not right !
Lord, have mercy ! -What ?
She took her skirt off.  Oh, I-- I cannot hear this.
Black panties,  black bra--
Victoria's secret, spring catalog, page 27.
Girl got class.
Let me look a little closer. Oh, look at that.
Got a little tattoo. That's cute.
Looks like snoopy.
Snoopy ?  Yeah.
I love snoopy. Wait. - I love snoopy too. Let me look at this thing.
Hold up. Wait a minute.
She's goin' to the door. Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's goin' to the door.
She's openin' the door.
Look like somebody droppin' off a package.
Wait a minute.
Look like the same girl who dropped off the package at your office.
It's a bomb ! Bomb !
Watch out !  Watch out !
It's this one right here, I think.  Hey, lady, you got a bomb in there !
Open that door !
Kick the door.
What the-- No, no, no, no !
Damn, you fine. Carter !
Come on, Lee !  Come on !
Where ? Don't drop it ! Come on, this way !
Where should we go ?
I bajate !   I bajate, senora !
Roof ! Roof !
Don't trip ! Be careful !
Throw it,  Lee ! - Where ?
Lee, throw it !  -Where ?
Throw the bomb over the edge !  -Throw it !  Throw it !
Throw it over the edge !  -No, there's people down there !
Lee, throw it ! Lee !  Carter !  Carter !
Lee ! throw it !  Carter ! No !
We about to die !
Okay, get on your feet.
- Enough, all right ? - Put that down !
It's a bomb ! Hey ! Put that down !
Guys, no bomb. Nothing.
Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail ?
Lady, you must be outta your mind.   I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States secret service.
- How do we know that ?   Show me a badge right now.  - Here you go.
Let me see that again. I- I didn't get a good look at that.
We can help you. I'm a detective from Hong Kong.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.  I know.
We need to go out of sight, so come down to my suite.
Now why did you say it was a bomb ? - No, you said that.
No, you said it. -You said that in the hotel room.
I said she was the bomb.
She was the bomb ?
Look, I've been working this case for months now,
So if I seem a little aggravated, I apologize.
You need to tell us what's goin' on.
The triads and Reign, they think I'm a crooked customs agent.
- Is that a payoff ? - No.  That's a sample.
You guys ever heard of the superbill ?
I heard of it.  It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
Honey, it's much more than a counterfeit.
Fourteen out of fifteen world banks  can't even tell the difference.
The paper is crane linen blend, and the bills are printed on U.S. intaglio presses.
You wanna tell us how in the world  they get into the U.S. mint to use the presses ?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the shah of Iran.
Why ?  Because we wanted his oil.
Our government gave him a gift--
A U.S. treasury intaglio printing press.
Now, it's the only one to ever leave the country.
Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought  the press on the black market.
Five years ago ? Mm-hmm.
That's right before he left the force.
Earlier this year, Ricky Tan got a hold of one-of-a-kind swiss-made hundred-dollar plates,
and he started printing superbills.
that's why Hu Li killed him-- for the plates.
and they've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars.
There's only one way to spot a fake.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red.
You see ? Now, the real ink, it burns black.
So what in the hell they gonna do  with $100 million of phony money ?
You know, Carter, I believe you're asking the wrong question.
The real question is, where are the plates ?
Because if we can find the plates,  we can stop the whole operation.
- Right ? - Yeah, you're right.
Maybe this is where you can help us, guys.
Yeah.  I mean, Carter, This is your city, right ?
Yeah, this is my titty. I mean, this is my city.
Great.  And Lee, you know Hu Li and the triads, correct ?
-Yes.  -Great.
So can you do me a favor ? Can you find out where Hu Li's keeping the plates ?
-That ain't no problem.  -Thank you.
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.
From this moment on, you're officially working  for the United States secret service.
Secret service agent James Carter.
Oh, that sounds good. It's got a nice ring to it, don't it ?
I'm tellin' you, Lee, give me six months.
Six months and I'm gonna be in Washington, D.C., protectin' the president.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Yeah, but they don't know that.
I'm gonna talk to Isabella, see if she can hook somethin' up.
seein' the way she was starin' at a brother. - She never even look at you.
Just jealous, Lee, 'cause the girl chose me,
'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,  and you third-world ugly.
I'm not third-world ugly. Women like me.
They think I'm cute, like snoopy.
Lee, snoopy is six inches taller than you.
Sterling.
Lee and Carter are officially out of the secret service's way.
Correct.
This is my informant's place. They got pretty good ribs here too.
I like kosher.
Hey.  Hey, wait.
Oh, I know I don't think I see what I see what I'm thinkin' !
I know good and well y'all ain't gamblin' back here !
This is supposed to be a Chinese restaurant !  What you doin' in here, James ?
You about to go to jail. You about to go to jail, and all your little friends.

-All right, all right. Let's talk outside. - You wanna talk outside ?
-Yes. -Let's go then. You wanna talk.

That's good. -What's up, Kenny ?
-James Carter.   -What's up ?
What's up is I heard you was gettin'  your ass kicked out there in Hong Kong, brother.
-What ?  -That's right.
You crazy. Who told you that ?  - I got my sources.
Don't you worry about that.  -They tellin' you lies.
Look, man.  I'm about to bust you  if you don't give me some information.
How you gonna come up here and jam me up like this, James ?  Huh ?
You embarrass me in front of my wife, my kids out there.
Kenny, you embarrassin' yourself.
You a black man with a Chinese restaurant on crenshaw.
You come up in here, you ain't show me no badge.
You ain't even flashed a warrant.

and then I'm gonna whup your ass.
Kenny, we'd love to see that. We would.
Come on, Kenny !  Come on, Kenny ! Come on !

Where did you learn that ?
Oh.  They're brothers.
Oh, all right, all right.

Hey !  I heard that. I heard that.
Don't be talkin' about me, man.
You guys are here about some funny money, huh ? How you know ?
C-notes, right ?  -Yeah.
Any of 'em came through here ?
Look, one of my regulars came in here a few days ago,
dropped about 50 large on the tables in there.
I was about to go down there with my boys and tune his ass up,
But he comes in the next day with the whole thing.
brand-new one hundred dollar bills, sequential.
Now, I figure they're fake, 'cause this guy's got a regular day job.
So I test 'em, and they checked out.
You still have the bills ?
Still got my lunch money from the third grade.
Let me see 'em.
Hold it. What are you doin' ?
Whoa. Oh, it's fake.
He got you.  Who you say gave that to you ?
Cat named Zing. Work down at reign plaza.
Tell you what: you better hope you find him before I do.
All right.
Excuse me. L.A..P.D.
We're lookin' for a guy named Zing.
You ! Come here !  Come back here !
Hey !  Hey !  You little rascal !
Get back here !  Get back here  right now !
You know what ? I don't even know why the hell I'm here.
I ain't even Chinese.
All right, I'm sorry.
I think there's someone...
who would like to talk to them first.
Oh !
What'd you do that for ? That was unnecessary !
You done knocked out my filling, girl.  That's gonna cost you.
I ain't never hit a woman in my life, but your ass is pushin' it !

Okay, all right, all right.

Look at us. We good as dead !
Stop your whining, Carter ! - What you gonna do if I don't stop, huh ?
I will slap the hell outta you right now, Lee.
-Yeah ? - Yeah.

Yeah. Come on, let me see that.  I wanna see you do that !
You don't know who you're messin' with, man !
You don't know who you're messin' with, do you ?
I'll bite your damn nose off, man.  You bite--  come on !
Some apple ?
I'd put that knife away, bitch,  before you have an accident.
ain't no use, man.
Just tell me how the triads are gonna kill us.
They will torture us for three days.
I can handle that.  -Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.
Cut off our egg rolls ? Hell, no !
Let's get the hell outta here ! Come on, man !  Don't give up !
I don't wanna die !  -Be quiet.
Okay, give me your left leg.  -What for ?
Left leg ! aah !

Yeah, we slowin' down, man.

Come on, Lee !
Carter, go up.
Carter ! Carter !

What happened ?  You left me.
I didn't leave you, man. I was waitin' up there for you.
shh !
Whoa, man ! I ain't goin' in there !
Come on ! There's rats in there !
- There's no rats !  - Look at that rat !
aww !
Las Vegas ?
Vegas ? What the hell we doin' in Vegas ?
Look. Red Dragon.
That's the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Lee.
That's how you launder $100 million in cash.
Let's go. Let's go.
Aah ! Sorry. Aah !  Damn !
One at a time. What the hell is wrong with you ?
Wait a second, man.  What ?
We can't go in there like this.  Why ?
We got to look fly.  What mean "fly" ?
We got to mack out, man. We can't go in there like this.
What does it mean, "mack out" ?
Follow me, my Asian brother. I'll show you.
Come on.  Come on.
That's where we're going, right there.
When we get in there, you stay a couple steps behind me.
Huh ? You smell a little funky.
I think you stepped in some rat shit.
It was a cowboy hat, and now it's a pith helmet.
Hold on. Talk to you in a bit.
Hi, nice to see you. Can I help you gentlemen ?
Yeah, I'm gonna need black, 42 long,
and nothin' touches this body but pure silk.
and get my partner somethin' from the kids' department.
Would your partner like to be wrapped in silk as well ?
Some people think it's tacky, but I really enjoy it when couples dress alike.
No, this ain't no couple thing, man.
We're police officers.  We're workin' a dangerous case, and we need some clothes.
Yes.  There are a lot of men chasing us.
As well they should be. Listen, you have nothing to worry about, okay ?
because I'm gonna turn you two into the belle of the ball.
Thank you. Absolutely.  Let's start with you, shall we ?
You've got the mochaccino face, wonderful skin, and the big, broad shoulders, okay ?
Let's put a dead animal on you.  Croc skin.
Butter cream, croc skin,  butter cream--
What size is the waist ? Let's go in.
Hey ! Watch it, sweetness !
He's got some fire to him. Honey cups !
I like that. Go get the clothes ! Hurry up !
I'll pull some items. oh, Jesus.  I'll be back.
You see that ?   -He likes you.
I'm not shoppin' with you no more.
Act like you're rich.
Ladies and gentlemen,  Steven Reign,
Owner and founder of the Red Dragon casino.
Thank you.
Thank you. Good evening.
A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy village in China...
hired a young dragon to guard their treasures in a cave.
the people of the village started sneaking him extra food,
hoping to make him stronger.
the dragon grew so big he got stuck,
and the treasure was trapped behind him...
for all eternity.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that lost treasure.
It is here, inside the greatest casino in the world !
Welcome to the Red Dragon,
Where everybody is a winner !
Black, 29.
Look at this place, Lee. It's the biggest front in the world.
Yeah, right--
Would you like a drink ?   Drink ? Cigarettes ?
Put your arms around me.  What ?
Hold me close. There are cameras everywhere.
What's going on ? - I think I may be in trouble, Lee.
I really need your help.
Last time you needed my help, I woke up in a truck.
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice. You have to trust me.
Look over my right shoulder. That's the soft count room.
We think the plates are in there.
I need you to go and get them.
Why don't you go get them ?  -Because if I'm wrong,
then my entire cover is blown, understand ?
How do I know I can trust you ?
Dip me.
I'm asking for real now.
Will you help the secret service ?
Hey, Lee !  Lee!
What are you doing ?  Thank you, man. Take this.
-Dancing.    - Dancin' ?
Man, I'm up here workin', puttin' my life on the line,
and you're up here dancin' with some bimbo ?
Does she have a friend ?  -That was Isabella.
She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Lee, I know you didn't just say Isabella.  Are you crazy, man ?  Yes.
That girl issettin' you up again.  -No.  I'm gonna find out.
No, wait, man.
There's security all over. If you're gonna do this, you need a distraction.
So keep your eye on me, and you'll know when to make your move.
- Good.    - Cool.
Come on, big eight ! Come on, Tex !
Hey, hey, hey ! Good roll, man !
This table's hot ! I want some of this money.  Get me in this game.  Come on.
Sir, are you aware that there's a $50,000 buy-in this evening ?
If that's the case, give me $100,000 in chips.
Let me have a diet Pepsi and some hot wings.
- 100,000.  Give him the chips. - Come on !  Let's play !   I'm gonna get some of this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this ?
- $500 chips, sir. - You gave me $500 chips 'cause I'm black ?
Uh, no, sir. I did not. I just assumed that--
You assumed that a brother comin' in here can only afford $500 a roll.
- Is that it ? - Uh, no, I didn't think that at all, sir.
- You a racist ? - No, I'm not, sir.
How come everybody else around the table  got $1,000 chips, and the black man got a nickel ?
How did that happen ?  I don't know. It just happened.
This is crazy.  You think my people suffered 362 years of slavery...
So you could send us back to the cotton fields with $500 chips ?
- No. - Do I look like chicken George to you ?
You do not. I have no idea. What the hell is that ?
- I think you should calm down. - I think you should go over there and count somethin'.
Give me my chips,  and I want $1,000 chips !
Hurry up.  I just want to be treated fairly.   Is that too much to ask ?
No.  Is that too much to ask ?
I got a problem on table nine.
How come ain't no black people performin' in this hotel ?  We ain't good enough ?
We got Lionel Ritchie performin' here tonight.
Lionel Ritchie ain't been black since the commodores, man.
What about peaches and herb ? Gladys knight and the pips ?
Ike and Tina. They can get back together.  This is crazy.
Sir, why don't you calm down, win some money, and have some fun ?
I ain't calmin' down no more ! I'm sick of you tryin' to calm me down.
We got a problem. Go.
I have a dream...
that white people and black people...
and even Chinese people can gamble together...
without gettin' different chips !
hallelujah !
Hold it, hold it. In the spirit of brotherhood, let's just play craps, man.
Come on.  Let's go.  Come on !
Oh, shit.
Hey !
Get him !  Stop !
- amah ! - Winner.
Yes ! yes, yes, yes !
I feel good. Oh, who put their hand on my butt ?
Do it again.  Give me that. How much I win ?
200,000, sir.
$200,000 ?
Yeah !  Whoo ! All right.
This seven I'm about to roll...
Is for the 27 years Mandela spent in that prison  and couldn't get no justice...
and took all that crap.
That's why I ain't gonna crap out.  This one is for Mandela !
- A winner.  Seven. -  Free at last
Free at last
Out.
Imagine a business where people hand you money,
and you hand them back absolutely nothing.
Now, that's the real American  dream.
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...
and a most beautiful U.S. customs agent,
I'm back in business.
Look at you, Lee.
You look ridiculous.
You know it didn't have to be like this.
It's too bad.
Like father, like son.
Look at this old fool.
What does he think he's doing ?
I tell you, it's almost impossible to find a partner...
that is trustworthy and loyal.
Don't you agree, Lee ?
Everything stays on the table. Don't nobody touch that table. You understand ?
All right.
Winner, four high, four high.
Yes !  Yes ! Oh, my goodness ! That's $500,000 !
- Yes ! - Come on, sir.
- Cash me out. - Sir, you're gonna have to get off the table.
Thank you very much.
The trouble with partners is, they die.
Have fun.
Don't move ! U.S. secret service !  You're under arrest.
These gentlemen will escort you to the cashier.
Good, 'cause I don't want to get jumped  by any of these rich white folks.  Let's go.
mmm !
I appreciate this, fellas. you never can be too safe.
-  - What the--
I'm sorry, man. Did that hurt ?
- Hey, you !  Hold it ! -
You okay ?
mmm !  mmm !  mmm, mmm, mmm !
mmm !
Black man get on a roll, y'all start trippin'.
Y'all get back ! Calm down !
Get back !  Get back ! Get back !
-   Drop the stick.
Lee !  aah !
Where you been, Lee ? I been on a roll, man ! mmm !
What happened to you, man ? Huh ?
What's that light in your mouth ?
Oh, man, this can't be good.
Mmm !
Move !  Would you get out of my way ?
What's wrong with you ?
What happened to you, man ?  Mmm !  Mmm !  Mmm !
Mmm !  Mmm ! Mmm !  Mmm !
Why the hell you didn't tell me you had a bomb in your mouth ?
I did ! I said "mmm !"   -No, you didn't !
What the hell is "mmm" ?   - "Mmm, boom !"
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse. - Ricky Tan dead.
What you talking about ? Whoa !
Lee.  go after Ricky, man. I got this.
- Carter-- - Just go, man.  I got this.
I'm not gonna hold back on you this time just because you're a woman.
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.
a very beautiful man with a perfect body,
who I'd like to take to the movies.
Oh.
Hooh !  Hah ! You don't know nothin' about this, do you ?
Egyptian style, girl. you want some of this ?
Come on.
- Are you okay ?  -I'm fine  -You need help.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Well, now you know.
What's wrong with you, woman ?
Mmm, you smell good.
aah !
yaah !
aah !
Thank you, Benjamin.  Thank you.
We could have been a good couple.
We could have had somethin' special.
But you one crazy-ass bitch !
American's love to gamble, don't they, Mr. Reign ?
I never gamble.
Oh, I'm, uh, cutting our deal short.
Oh.
And my plates ?
The plates stay with me. I'm sure you won't have a problem with that.
I enjoyed that little story you told...
about the dragon and the treasure.
My mother used to tell it to me all the time.
Do you know the moral of that story ?
Greed will imprison us all.
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.
Just like your father.
I really did try to help him, you know.
To share with him.
To make your life better.
But he was too weak.
Too afraid of change.  -Give me the plates.
-It's over.  -I don't think it's over.
There are casinos all over this country.
I can make you a very rich man, Lee.
Don't make the same mistake your father did.
If you reach for that gun, I'll kill you.
Don't you remember ? I'm already dead.
Hey, Ricky. How you doin' ?
Lee, I see you got everything under control.
I'm gonna go downstairs and--  goddamn !
- What happened to Reign ? - Would you like me to tell you how your father died ?
Hey, hey.  Wait one second, Lee.
It ain't worth it, man. He tryin' to trick you.
Don't go too far, now.  -He never begged for his life or tried to make a deal.
Put the gun down. -All he asked me,
just seconds before I pulled the trigger,
was that I promise not to kill you.
Oh, it was so pathetic.
Oh, hell, no.  He went too far. Shoot his ass right now, Lee. Shoot his ass !
- What are you gonna do, Lee ? - All you got to do is pull that trigger back and bam !
Are you going to spend  the rest of your life hiding like your father ?
Man, don't let him talk about your daddy like that.  Shoot him, Lee.
- You can't do it, can you ? - Yes, hell, you can, Lee.
- Ain't nobody up here but us. - Just as I thought.
He tryin' to punk you. Shoot him !
If you ain't gonna shoot him, kung fu his ass or somethin'.
- Carter ! -
No !
Damn ! Good kick, Lee.
It was an accident.
- That's okay.  We'll just say he tried to catch a cab.
What's that in your-- oh, hell, no.
-  - Lady, you listen to me right now.
You put that bomb down and turn it off !  Carter, we have to jump !
- You crazy.  I ain't jumpin'. -
Use your jacket ! Hey, turn that bomb off !
-  - Crazy-ass--
That wasn't so bad.
-
I cannot believe I flew 10,000 miles for this shit.
Detective Lee, I hate to admit it,
but the United States secret service is indebted to you.
-Thank you.  -Thank you.
I'll see you on board.
I want to thank you too.
It was nice working with you.
I saw that.
You sly devil, you. She kissed you, didn't she ?
Ah, you played it cool, too, walkin' away and not lookin' back.  I like that.
Yeah. I'm a player.
- Where is she headed ?  -She's going to New York.
Mmm.
Is that your gate down there ? - Yep.
Well, I'm this way.
Guess that mean good-bye. -I guess so.
Thank you, Carter.
Take good care of yourself, Lee.
-Oh, Carter.  -Yeah, Lee ?
What's up ?
There is something I want you to have.
Oh, no, man. This is your daddy's badge.  I can't take that, man.  No way.
It's okay. No. Finally, I can let it go.
Thank you, man.
Hey, you know what ? I got somethin' for you too.
What is this ?  -That's $10,000, man.
I got it at the tables this mornin' at Caesar's.  I'm still hot.
I can't take this. -No, don't worry about it. I got a lot more.
Go ahead.  Enjoy yourself. -No, Carter. I can't have this.
Would you stop actin' like a cop for one second, man, and live it up ?
There gotta be something you want.  Come on.
Think about it.
This is the final boarding call for flight 44 to La Guardia.
I always wanted to go to Madison square garden, see the knicks play.
-New York city ?  - First class.
-The plaza hotel ?   -Maybe a little mu shu ?
- Amen to that, brother.   -So, what do you say ?
You know what, man ? I can use another vacation.
