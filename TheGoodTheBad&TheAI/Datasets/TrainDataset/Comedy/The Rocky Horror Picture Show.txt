...orbidden Planet
Here they come.
I'd like the parents
and the grandparents.
Yes, all the close family.
Smile! Hold fast. Beautiful!
Congratulations.
Well... .
I guess we really did it, huh?
You and Betty have been inseparable...
...since you met in
Dr. Scott's courses.
Tell you the truth, Brad, she was the
only reason I came in the first place.
I mean...
Okay, guys, this is it!
You ready?
Look, Betty's gonna throw her bouquet.
I got it!
- I got it!
- Hey, big fella.
Looks like it could be
your turn next.
Who knows.
So long.
See you, Brad.
Come on, hop in.
See you, Brad.
Brad, wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful?
Just an hour ago she was
plain old Betty Munroe.
And now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.
- Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy.
- Yes.
Oh, I always cry at weddings.
Everyone knows Betty's
a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
Ralph will be in line
for promotion in a year.
Yes.
- Hey, Janet.
- Yes, Brad?
I've got something to say.
Oh, Brad.
I would like, if I may...
...to take you on a strange journey.
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...
...when Brad Majors and
his fiancée, Janet Weiss...
...two young, ordinary,
healthy kids...
...left Denton that
late November evening...
...to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...
...ex-tutor and now friend
to both of them.
It's true there were
dark storm clouds...
...heavy, black and pendulous...
...toward which they were driving.
It's true also that the spare tire
they carried...
...was badly in need of some air.
But they, being normal kids and...
...on a night out...
...they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out.
It was a night out...
...they were going to remember...
...for a very long time.
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.
They sure do take their lives
in their hands.
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap
to that type.
What's the matter, Brad, darling?
We took the wrong fork
a few miles back.
Oh.
Where did that motorcyclist come from?
I guess we'll just have to turn back.
What was that bang?
We must have a blowout.
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten
that spare tire fixed.
You stay here and I'll go for help.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?
Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.
I'm going too.
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.
Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman...
...and you might never
come back again.
And so...
...it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...
...and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.
Or had they?
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.
Hello.
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.
This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.
Do you have a phone we might use?
You're wet.
Yes, it's raining.
Yes.
Oh.
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.
You're too kind.
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?
It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
This way.
Are you having a party?
You've arrived on
a rather special night.
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.
He's lucky, I'm lucky,
we're all lucky!
Say something.
Say! Do any of you guys know
how to Madison?
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.
They're probably foreigners
with different ways.
They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.
Hit it! Hit it!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Brad!
We'll play along for now and pull out
the aces when the time is right.
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
You are...?
You are very lucky to be invited
up to rank's laboratory.
Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.
People like you, maybe?
I've seen it.
Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.
Shift it!
Is he...? rank, I mean,
is he your husband?
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.
Magenta.
Columbia.
Go and assist Riff Raff.
I will entertain... .
Brad Majors and this is
my fiancée, Janet Vice.
- Weiss.
- Weiss?
Well, how nice.
And what charming underclothes
you both have.
But here, put these on.
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.
It's not often
we receive visitors here.
Let alone offer them hospitality.
Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!
A reasonable request you have ignored!
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!
How forceful you are, Brad.
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.
You must be awfully proud
of him, Janet.
Well, yes, I am.
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.
Oh, well. How about you?
Everything is in readiness, master.
We merely await your word.
Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists...
...you are to witness
a new breakthrough...
...in biochemical research.
And paradise is to be mine!
It was strange the way it happened.
Suddenly...
...you get a break.
All the pieces seem to fit into place.
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.
The answer was there all the time.
It took a small accident
to make it happen.
- An accident!
- An accident!
That's how I discovered the secret.
That elusive ingredient.
That spark...
...that is the breath of life.
Yes.
I have that knowledge.
I hold the secret...
...to life itself!
You see...
...you are fortunate.
or tonight is the night...
...that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.
And step up the reactor power input...
...three more points!
Oh, Brad!
It's all right, Janet.
Oh, Rocky!
Oh, my baby!
Well, really!
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.
But since you're such
an exceptional beauty...
...I'm prepared to forgive you.
Oh, I just love success!
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.
He's okay.
Okay?
Okay?!
I think we can do better than that.
Now, Brad and Janet...
...what do you think of him?
Well... .
I don't like men
with too many muscles.
I didn't make him for you!
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.
Eddie!
Lovely party!
One from the vaults.
Oh, baby!
Don't be upset.
It was a mercy killing.
He had a certain naive charm...
...but no muscle.
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...
...and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.
If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.
However, the sudden departure
of their host...
...and his creation...
...into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...
...had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...
...and they were shown
to their separate rooms.
Who is it? Who's there?
It's only me, Janet.
Brad, darling, come in.
Oh, Brad!
Yes, my darling! But what if...?
Everything's going to be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never... .
Yes. Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!
Brad. Oh, Brad!
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!
I was saving myself.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Promise you won't tell Brad?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!
It'll destroy us.
Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.
Oh, Janet.
Janet!
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.
I thought it was the real thing!
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.
You liked it, didn't you?
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.
Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.
You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.
Coming!
What's happening here? Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?
Oh, Brad!
Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?
Oh, If only we hadn't
made this journey.
If only the car hadn't broken down.
If only we were amongst friends
or sane persons.
Oh, Brad.
What have they done with him?
Brad, how could you?
But you're hurt.
Did they do this to you?
Here. I'll dress your wounds.
Baby, there. Oh.
...vehement or excited mental state. "
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...
Tell us about it, Janet.
You mean she...?
More, more, more.
Down, down, down.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night?
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Mercy!
How did it happen?
I understood you were to be watching.
I was only away for a minute, master.
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.
Master.
Master, we have a visitor.
Hey, Scotty!
Dr. Everett Scott.
You know this earthling...
...this person?
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.
I see.
So this wasn't
simply a chance meeting.
You came here with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.
He was a science teacher
at Denton High.
And now he works for your government.
He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...
...of that which you call UOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?
He might be. I don't know.
The intruder is entering
the building, master.
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.
Shall we inquire of him in person?
Great Scott!
urter.
We meet at last.
Dr. Scott!
Brad! What are you doing here?
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.
It was part of your plan, was it not?
That he and his female
should check the layout for you?
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.
I know Brad is.
I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.
I came here to find Eddie.
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?
What do you know of Eddie?
I know a great deal
about a lot of things.
You see, Eddie happens to be
my nephew.
Dr. Scott.
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
Listen! I made you...
...and I can break you just as easily.
Master, dinner is prepared!
Excellent.
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.
ood has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:
The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man...
...and now this meal.
A toast.
To absent friends.
To absent friends.
And Rocky.
- Shall we?
We came here to discuss Eddie.
Eddie!
It's a rather tender subject.
Another slice, anyone?
Excuse me.
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.
Aliens!
Dr. Scott!
Go on, Dr. Scott.
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?
Just what exactly are you implying?
It's all right!
That's all right, Brad.
Und
Und
Und
Und
Oh.
Oh, Rocky!
How could you?!
This way! This way!
Shut up!
My feet! I can't move my feet!
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
You are.
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.
We're trapped.
No!
You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.
This sonic transducer...
...it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.
It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.
But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.
A device capable
of breaking down solid matter...
...and then projecting it
through space, and who knows...
...perhaps even time itself!
He's gonna send us to another planet?
Planet schmanet, Janet.
And then she cried out:
Stop!
My God! I can't stand
any more of this.
irst, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.
You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.
I loved you.
Do you hear me? I loved you.
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.
You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.
Well, I've had enough!
Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.
It's not easy, having a good time.
Even smiling makes my face ache.
And my children turn on me.
Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.
Maybe I made a mistake...
...splitting his brain
between the two of them.
I grow weary of this world!
When shall we return to Transylvania?!
Magenta...
...I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.
You have both served me well.
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.
You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing, master.
And you shall receive it in abundance!
Come. We are ready
for the floorshow.
...fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...
...should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.
But it was to be in a situation...
...which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement...
...Brad and Janet had both tasted...
...forbidden fruit.
This in itself was proof...
...that their host
was a man of little morals...
...and some persuasion.
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?
And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?
In an empty house...
...in the middle of the night?
What diabolical plan...
...had seized
rank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?
rom what had gone before,
it was clear...
...that this was to be no picnic.
We've got to get...
...out of this trap...
...before this decadence...
...saps our wills.
I've got to be strong...
... try to hang on.
Or else my mind...
...may well snap.
my life will be lived...
Wait!
I can explain.
How sentimental.
And also presumptuous of you.
You see, when I said "we"...
...were to return to Transylvania...
...I referred only
to Magenta and myself.
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading...
...but you see...
...you are to remain here.
In spirit anyway.
Good heavens, that's a laser.
Yes, Dr. Scott.
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.
You're going to kill him?
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected.
Exactly, Dr. Scott.
Now, urter,
your time has come
Say goodbye to all of this...
...and hello to oblivion.
No.
No.
No!
Good God!
You killed them.
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.
They didn't like me!
They never liked me!
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're okay by me.
Dr. Scott...
...I'm sorry about your nephew.
Eddie?
Yes, well,
perhaps it was for the best.
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.
We are about
to beam the entire house...
...back to the planet of Transsexual...
...in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go.
Now.
Our noble mission
is almost completed...
...my most beautiful sister.
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores...
...of our beloved planet.
Sweet Transsexual.
Land of night.
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.
To take that...
...step to the right.
And our world...
...will do the time warp again!
