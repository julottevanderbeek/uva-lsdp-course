HEY, LADY
YOU, LADY
CURSING AT YOUR LIFE
YOU'RE A DISCONTENTED MOTHER
AND A REGIMENTED WIFE
I'VE NO DOUBT
YOU DREAM ABOUT
THE THINGS YOU'LL NEVER DO
BUT I WISH SOMEONE
HAD TALKED TO ME
LIKE I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU
OOH, I'VE BEEN TO GEORGIA
AND CALIFORNIA
AND ANYWHERE
I COULD RUN
TOOK THE HAND
OF A PREACHER MAN
AND WE MADE LOVE
IN THE SUN
BUT I RAN OUT OF PLACES
AND FRIENDLY FACES
BECAUSE I HAD TO BE FREE
I'VE BEEN TO PARADISE
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ME
PLEASE, LADY
PLEASE, LADY
DON'T JUST WALK AWAY
'CAUSE I HAVE
THIS NEED TO TELL YOU
WHY I'M ALL ALONE TODAY
I CAN SEE SO MUCH OF ME
STILL LIVING IN YOUR EYES
WON'T YOU SHARE A PART
OF A WEARY HEART
THAT HAS LIVED
A MILLION LIES
OH, I'VE BEEN TO NICE
AND THE ISLE OF GREECE
WHILE I SIPPED CHAMPAGNE
ON A YACHT
I MOVED LIKE HARLOW
IN MONTE CARLO
AND SHOWED 'EM
WHAT I'VE GOT
I'VE BEEN UNDRESSED BY KINGS
AND I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS
THAT A WOMAN
AIN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE
I'VE BEEN
TO PARADISE
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO ME
OOH-OOH

IN GREEN PASTURES.
"HE LEADETH ME
BESIDE THE STILL WATERS.

"THOU PREPAREST
A TABLE BEFORE ME...

MY HEAD WITH OIL.
MY CUP RUNNETH OVER.
"SURELY GOODNESS
AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME
ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE,
AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE
OF THE LORD FOREVER."
IT'S NOT FAIR.
I'VE SPENT HALF MY LIFE
AND ALL MY SAVINGS...
TRYING TO SNAG
A SYMPATHETIC HUSBAND.
THE SELFISH LITTLE SHIT
GOES AND DIES ON ME.
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD,
AND HE SLIPS OVER
IN A BATHROOM.
HE DIDN'T SLIP.
HE WAS PEROXIDING HIS HAIR
AT HOME AGAIN,
AND HE ASPHYXIATED
ON THE FUMES.
I'VE GOT TO GET
SOME SPACE.
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO
A SHOW OUT OF TOWN.
THAT'S NICE.
COME WITH ME.
I'LL NEED SOME HELP,
AND WE COULD BOTH USE
THE BREAK.
YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
WHERE IS IT ?

"WOULD HELP ME GET OVER
THIS PHASE I'M GOING THROUGH.

I MIGHT MEET SOME
LOVELY COUNTRY GIRL."

DON'T ASK
HOW MANY TIMES--
GOOD NIGHT, JOHN-BOY.
I'M SERIOUSLY FALLING ASLEEP.
IT'S YOUR SHIFT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA

SORRY.  SHIT !
WHAT IS IT ?
PERHAPS
WE SHOULD HAVE FLOWN.
WRONG, BUT THANKS FOR PLAYING.
ANYONE ELSE ?

WITCHETTY GRUB.

I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE
SOMETHING BEGINNING WITH "R."
RECTUM ?
NO.
RING PIRATE ?
NO.
ROAD ?
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
NOTHING, DARLING.
DON'T "DARLING" ME, DARLING.
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'VE GOT A FACE
LIKE A CAT'S ASS.
COME ON, FESS UP.
JUST WORRIED
ABOUT THE SHOW.
WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANY REHEARSALS YET.
WE'VE GOT TWO WEEKS.
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO REHEARSE.
NOW WHAT
IS YOUR PROBLEM ?
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
I JUST WANT
THE SHOW TO BE GOOD.
IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD.
HOW DID YOU GET
THIS JOB, MITZI ?
WHO IS THE FISH THAT RUNS
THIS BLOODY HOTEL ANYWAY ?
YOUR MOTHER ?
NO, MY WIFE.
OH.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE
GOT AN EX-BOYFRIEND
OUT HERE SOMEWHERE.
NO, MY WIFE.
I'M MARRIED.
-
-
AND WHEN THE JOINT
BANK ACCOUNT RAN DRY
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS...
I GUESS I PREFERRED
HER WEING RING TO MINE;
SO, NO DRAMA.
WE SWAPPED
AND CALLED IT A DAY.
THIS IS GETTING TOO WEIRD.
YOU AND A WOMAN ?
WHAT DID SHE
USED TO DO FOR KICKS ?
PUT A BUCKET ON YOUR HEAD
AND SWING OFF THE HANDLE ?
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
I DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOU,
FELICIA:
YOUR FACE.
HOW ABOUT SHUTTING
BOTH OF THEM ?
THIS EXPLAINS YOUR ABYSMAL
BATTING AVERAGE.
I WONDERED WHY
YOUR DANCE CARD WAS SO EMPTY.
I TAKE IT YOU NEVER
GOT A DIVORCE THEN.
WELL, GIRLS,
WHAT CAN I SAY ?
HERE'S TO A SECRET
VERY WELL-KEPT.
SHAME IT'S NOT GOING
TO STAY THAT WAY, ISN'T IT ?
HMM.
GOT ANY MORE LITTLE
SURPRISES YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE WITH US ?
HAVEN'T GOT ANY KIDS
STASHED AWAY AS WELL,
HAVE YOU ?
LOOK...
I HAVEN'T LIED
ABOUT ANYTHING.
AFTER SIX YEARS,
I GET A PHONE CALL
SCREAMING FOR HELP.
CHRIST KNOWS I OWE HER
A COUPLE OF FAVORS.
I'M SORRY
THAT I NEVER TOLD YOU.
I'M NOT SORRY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DOLLS.
I'M AS JEALOUS AS ALL HELL.
WHAT ?
SO, WAS IT A BIG WEING ?
GET LOTS OF PRESSIES,
DID YOU ?
I WISH I WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO HAVE BEEN THERE.
OH, HA, HA.
I'D HAVE BOUGHT YOU
A LOVELY MATCHING SET
OF "HERS" AND "HERS" BATH MATS.
GIVE IT A REST.
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.
IMAGINE...
MITZI THE MAGNIFICENT
AND HER BLUSHING BRIDE.
MOWING LAWNS MUST HAVE BEEN
MURDER ON YOUR HEELS.
ALL RIGHT, FELICIA,
THAT'S ENOUGH.
LET'S PUT SOME MONEY
IN THAT SEETHING CESSPOOL
MOUTH OF YOURS.
IF I WIN THIS GAME,
YOU WILL NEVER MENTION
MY WIFEEVERAGAIN, OKAY ?
AND IF I WIN ?
NAME YOUR PRICE.
WELL, NOW, WHAT WOULD I LIKE
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE...
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD ?
SNAP !
BETTER BE QUICK.
PLEASE DON'T TALK
ABOUT BEING TRUE
AND ALL THE TROUBLE
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
PLEASE DON'T TALK
ABOUT ALL THE PLANS
WE HAD FOR FIXING
THIS BROKEN ROMANCE
I WANT TO GO
WHERE THE PEOPLE DANCE
WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING ?
TAKE THAT BLOODY FROCK OFF.
DON'T MAKE IT WORSE THAN IT IS.
YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO LET YOU WALK AWAY
WITH ALL THE ATTENTION ?
NO CHANCE.
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S GO SHOPPING.
OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE
I'VE GOT TO BOOGIE
ON THE DISCO ROUND
OH, YEAH
OH, I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE

ABOUT LOVE TONIGHT
YOUR SWEET TALK

LOVING LIES
JUST BRING ME DOWN
WHEN YOU'VE GOT WOMEN
ALL OVER TOWN
YOU CAN LOVE THEM ALL
AND WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH
MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE--

TO BE KIING.
WELCOME TO MARIO PALACE.
COME IN, COME IN.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ?
WOULD YOU LIKE A ROOM,
MADAM ?
SUBTLE.
TACKARAMA.
WHO DOES ALL THE PAINTING

SOMEONE NEEDS THE WOOD.
WHAT HAVE WE HERE ?

BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY BANG
YOU'RE GONNA GET, SWEETHEART.
WHEN I'M WITH MY BABY

ANY MONEY, OKAY ?
OOH !

TO THROW 'EM BACK
LIKE THAT ?
THAT'S OUR GIRL,
BERNADETTE.
I KNEW STUMBLING
AROUND THE PUB CIRCUIT
WITH LES GIRLS FOR 200 YEARS...
MUST HAVE
TAUGHT HER SOMETHING.
YOU'RE A BLOODY MARVEL,
BERNIE.
BERNADETTE, PLEASE.
WHAT'S THAT ?
MY NAME ISN'T BERNIE.
SHE SAID HER NAME
ISN'T BERNIE.

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM--
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW ?
NO MATTER HOW TOUGH
I THINK I'M GETTING...
IT STILL HURTS.
HOPE IT STILL WORKS.
DON'T HAVE MUCH CALL
FOR IT DOWN HERE.
WHERE

URANUS.
OH, GOOD.
FISH GOT TO SWIM
BIRDS GOT TO FLY
- I GOT TO LOVE ONE MAN
TILL I DIE
- THERE !  LEFT.
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
IF WE STICK
TO THE SEALED ROAD,
WE'LL BE AT IT
AT LEAST ANOTHER TWO DAYS.
TELL ME HE'S LAZY

TAKE THE SHORTCUT.
TELL ME I'M CRAZY
MAYBE I KNOW
CAN'T HELP LOVING
THAT MAN OF MINE
ONE MORE PUSH, I'M GONNA
SMACK HIS FACE SO HARD,
HE'LL HAVE TO STICK
HIS TOOTHBRUSH UP HIS ASS
TO CLEAN HIS TEETH.
JUST LAY OFF.
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO USE THE "R" WORD.
WHAT DID YOU GO AND DO ?
I WAS ONLY HAVING
A BIT OF FUN.
"FUN" ?
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU DO FOR AMUSEMENT,
SLAM YOUR FINGERS IN DOORS ?
WHAT'S THE POINT ?
I LIKE SEEING PEOPLE
GET HOTHEADED, OKAY ?
IT GIVES ME A KICK.
IS IT TRUE
WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
THE DOCTOR
SLAPPED YOUR MOTHER ?
WHAT SORT OF BENT CHILDHOOD
DID YOU HAVE, ADAM WHITELY ?
ADAM ?  ADAM ?
COME IN HERE, BOY.
COME SIT OVER HERE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
SOME FUN WITH UNCLE BARRY ?
WE'LL PLAY
A SPECIAL GAME,
BUT YOU CAN'T
TELL ANYBODY...
EVER, EVER, EVER.
OKAY ?
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS PUT YOUR HAND DOWN HERE...
AND PULL VERY GENTLY,
OKAY ?
VERY GENTLY.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
OH, JESUS CHRIST, ADAM !
GET HELP.
UNCLE BARRY'S PING PONGS
ARE CAUGHT IN THE DRAIN.
GET MUMMY.
GET MUMMY !
NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO ?
NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER !
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART ?
MUM WAS OUT PLAYING GOLF,
AND THE DIRTY FUCK WAS STUCK
FOR SEVEN HOURS !
AND I THOUGHT
THEY WERE SMALL AND WRINKLED
BEFORE THEY GOT IN THE WATER !
HEY, I'VE GOT A JOKE.
WHO WANTS TO HEAR A JOKE ?
BERNICE,
YOU'LL LAUGH SO HARD...
YOUR LASHES WILL CURL
ALL BY THEMSELVES.
DO TELL US
YOUR HILARIOUS JOKE.
OKAY.
WELL, ONCE UPON A TIME
MANY MOONS AGO,
THERE WAS A BUNCH OF INDIANS
CALLED THE FUKAWIE TRIBE.
ONE DAY, THE SON
OF THE GREAT INDIAN CHIEF
SAYS TO HIS FATHER,
"WHY IS MY FRIEND LITTLE HAWK
CALLED LITTLE HAWK ?"
AND HIS FATHER SAYS--
"WHY DO YOU ASK,
TWO DOGS FUCKING ?"
THAT'S NOT THE END
OF THE JOKE.
SO, ANYWAY,
BACK TO ME--
-
- WHAT'S HAPPENING ?
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, FELICIA...
WHERE THE FUCK
ARE WE ?
SHIT !  SHIT !  SHIT !
OH, SHIT.
WELL, I'VE HAD A LOOK AROUND.
I THINK WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME
THAT I NOW KNOW LESS
ABOUT MOTORS...
THAN WHEN I FIRST LIFTED UP
THAT BONNETY THING.
NOW WHAT ?
LET'S JUST NOT THINK
ABOUT IT FOR THE MOMENT...
AND EAT BREKKIE.
THAT'S A NOVEL IDEA.
LET'S STUFF OURSELVES
TO DEATH.
IMAGINE THE HEADLINES:
"WHALES BEACH THEMSELVES
IN THE OUTBACK.
MYSTERY BOOM STICKS
DEAD IN DRAG."
NO POINT IN WALKING BACK.
THE ONLY LIFE I SAW WERE
THE HYPNOTIZED BUNNIES.
MOST ARE WEDGED IN THE TIRES.
SOMEBODY WILL DRIVE PAST
FOR SURE.
WE'LL KEEP THE FIRE BURNING.
WE'LL TOAST MARSHMALLOWS
AND CHILL CHAMPAGNE
FOR WHEN THEY ARRIVE.
WHAT IF THEY
DON'T DRIVE PAST ?
YOU'RE NOT HELPING HERE.
JUST EAT YOUR HORMONES.
HELL, WHY DIDN'T WE STICK
TO THE MAIN ROAD ?
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ?
- YOU GOT US INTO THIS,
ANTHONY BELROSE.
I SUGGEST YOU START THINKING
ABOUT HOW TO GET US BACK...
OR I DON'T FANCY
YOUR CHANCES OF EVER TRYING
TO BE A HUSBAND AGAIN.
JESUS, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO ?
WE'RE GONNA START
WITH A FACE-LIFT.
NOTHING LIKE A NEW FROCK
TO BRIGHTEN UP YOUR DAY.
PURPLE ?
IT'S NOT PURPLE.
IT'S LAVENDER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
IT'S NICE...
IN A HIDEOUS SORT OF WAY.
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?
IF YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO SIT AROUND...
WATCHING PICASSO TAKE ON
THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM,
YOU'VE GOT
ANOTHER THINK COMING.
I'LL BE BACK WITH THE CAVALRY
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
THERE GOES A TRANSSEXUAL,
LAST SEEN HEADING SOUTH.
WE CALL HER BERNIE,
BUT HER REAL NAME WAS--
ADAM.
I WAS PETRIFIED
KEPT THINKING
I COULD NEVER LIVE
WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE
BUT THEN I SPENT
SO MANY NIGHTS
THINKING HOW YOU
DID ME WRONG
AND I GREW STRONG
AND I LEARNED HOW
TO GET ALONG
AND SO YOU'RE BACK
FROM OUTER SPACE
d
I JUST WALKED IN
TO FIND YOU HERE
WITH THAT SAD LOOK-- d
HELP.  HELP.
WHAT'S THAT, PA ?
WHAT ?
OUT THERE, YOU NONG.
LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN.
HELP !
OH, THANK GOD.
THANK YOU.
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW GRATEFUL I AM.
I JUST WALKED IN
TO FIND YOU HERE
WITH THAT SAD LOOK
UPON YOUR FACE
I SHOULD HAVE--
YOU FUCKIN' BEAUTY.
OOH.  OOH, SHIT.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.
WISH I COULD
SAY THE SAME.
I WAS JUST DRAWING UP THE WILL.
COME AND MEET
OUR SAVIORS.
TONY, ADAM,
THIS IS MR. AND MRS. SPENCER.
HELLO.
HELLO.
WAIT !  STOP !
SHIT.
FOR GOODNESS SAKES,
LOOK AT YOURSELF, MITZ.
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU ?
GREEN IS NOT YOUR COLOR.
DO YOU THINK
ABOUT TRUMPET MUCH ?
NO.
TRUMPET WAS JUST
A NICE KID WHO HAD A THING
ABOUT TRANSSEXUALS.
LOTS OF PEOPLE DO.
SORT OF BENT STATUS SYMBOL,
YOU KNOW ?
"MY GIRLFRIEND USED
TO BE A BOYFRIEND."
THAT SORT OF THING.
ALWAYS GOOD
FOR A SUPPER INVITE.
STILL, IT WAS BETTER
THAN NOTHING.
NOTHING.
NOTHING FOR MILES.
CAN YOU HEAR THE DRUMS
FERNANDO
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE,
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.
NO MORE FUCKING ABBA.
IF WE HAVE THE TIME,
WE MAY AS WELL PUT IT
TO GOOD USE.
COME ON, GIRLS.
OFF YOUR SNATCHES.
REHEARSAL TIME.
SO YOU'RE BACK
FROM OUTER SPACE
OKAY ?
TWO BOBS TO START.

AND SO YOU'RE BACK

YOU DID IT
SO BEAUTIFULLY,
AND YOU DO IT SO WELL.
COME ON.
TRY IT FROM THE TOP.
ONE, TWO.
GO ON NOW, GO
WALK OUT THE DOOR
JUST TURN AROUND NOW
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME ANYMORE
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO TRIED
TO HURT ME WITH GOOD-BYE

NICE NIGHT FOR IT.
WELL, I FEEL ALL RIGHT
I FEEL ALL RIGHT
YES, I FEEL ALL RIGHT
WELL, I FEEL ALL RIGHT

I THINK WE JUST
CRASHED A PARTY.
NO.  COME ON,
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO MY OFFICE.
HAVE A SEAT.
BERNICE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT COULD HAVE POSSESSED YOU
TO WEAR THAT TO A CORROBOREE.
SHUT YOUR FACE.
BRAVO !
FABULOUS !
WELL, GIRLS...
I GUESS IT'S OUR TURN.
AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID
I WAS PETRIFIED
KEPT THINKING
I COULD NEVER LIVE
WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE
BUT THEN I SPENT
SO MANY NIGHTS
THINKING HOW
YOU DID ME WRONG
AND I GREW STRONG
AND I LEARNED
HOW TO GET ALONG
AND SO YOU'RE BACK
FROM OUTER SPACE
I JUST WALKED IN
TO FIND YOU HERE
WITH THAT SAD LOOK
UPON YOUR FACE
I SHOULD HAVE CHANGED
THAT STUPID LOCK
I SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU
LEAVE YOUR KEY
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
FOR JUST ONE SECOND
YOU'D BE BACK TO BOTHER ME
GO ON NOW, GO
WALK OUT THE DOOR
JUST TURN AROUND NOW
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT WELCOME ANYMORE
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO TRIED
TO HURT ME WITH GOOD-BYE
DID YOU THINK I'D CRUMBLE
DID YOU THINK
I'D LAY DOWN AND DIE
OH, NO, NOT I
I WILL SURVIVE
OH, AS LONG AS I KNOW
HOW TO LOVE
I KNOW I'LL STAY ALIVE
I'VE GOT ALL MY LIFE TO LIVE
I'VE GOT ALL MY LOVE
TO GIVE
AND I'LL SURVIVE
I WILL SURVIVE
HEY, HEY
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
OOH.
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
IT TOOK ALL THE STRENGTH I HA
NOT TO FALL APART
JUST TRYING HARD
TO MEND THE PIECES
OF MY BROKEN HEART
AND I'VE SPENT
OH SO MANY NIGHTS
JUST FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF
I USED TO CRY
BUT NOW I HOLD
MY HEAD UP HIGH
AND YOU SEE ME
SOMEBODY NEW
I'M NOT THAT
CHAINED-UP LITTLE PERSON
STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND SO YOU FELT
LIKE DROPPING IN AND JUST
EXPECT ME TO BE FREE
NOW I'M SAVING ALL MY LOVING
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S LOVING ME
GO ON NOW, GO
WALK OUT THE DOOR
JUST TURN AROUND NOW
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT WELCOME ANYMORE
SO YOU ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY
BY DRESSING UP LIKE A WOMAN ?
SURE.  YOU CAN
MAKE A FINE LIVING
IN A PAIR OF HEELS.
WHY, ALAN ?
YOU WANT A JOB ?
OH !
IF ONLY THIS DRESS COULD TALK.
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHERE I GET MY TASTE FROM.
DEFINITELY NOT
MY MOTHER.
SERVES ME RIGHT
FOR LETTING HER BUY ME
THESE AWFUL CLOTHES.
WHAT'S THIS ?
THAT, MY DARLING,
IS MY MOST TREASURED POSSESSION
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.
BUT WHAT IS IT ?
A FEW YEARS AGO, I WENT
ON A PILGRIMAGE BACKSTAGE
TO AN ABBA CONCERT,
HOPING TO GRAB AN AUDIENCE
WITH HER ROYAL HIGHNESS,
AGNETHA.
WHEN I SAW HER DUCKING
INTO THE LADIES LOO,
I FOLLOWED HER IN.
AFTER SHE'D FINISHED
HER BUSINESS, I DUCKED
INTO THE CUBICLE,
ONLY TO FIND
SHE'D LEFT ME A LITTLE GIFT
SITTING IN THE TOILET BOWL.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME ?
THIS IS AN ABBA TURD ?
I KNOW
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS.
ARE YOU RIGHT ?
HANG ON.
OKAY !  GO !
THERE !
GOOD AFTERNOON.
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM ?
WHAT A NICE DOG.
WHAT'S ITS NAME ?
HERPES.
IF SHE'S GOOD,
SHE'LL HEEL.
THINGS GET PRETTY QUIET
AROUND HERE.  WE'RE JUST
STARVED FOR ENTERTAINMENT.
GLAD WE COULD OBLIGE.
HOW DOES IT LOOK ?
YOUR GAS TANK
IS FULL OF CRUD.
TRAVELING A ROUGH ROAD
ON A LOW TANK...
CHUCKED IT
INTO THE MOTOR.
YOUR FUEL LINE'S BLOCKED,
INJECTORS ARE STUFFED.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU CAN FIX IT ?
IN THE SHORT TERM.
WHAT YOU BLOKES NEED
IS A NEW GAS TANK.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU
HAVE ONE LYING AROUND ?
NO.  SORRY.
YOU CAN PICK ONE UP
IN COOBER PEDY IN A WEEK.
- WHEN DO YOU HAVE
TO BE IN ALICE ?
- SIX DAYS.
WELL, WE CAN CLEAN IT OUT
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
YOU MIGHT MAKE IT.
WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY.
REFRESHMENTS !
LEMONADE,
HERE I MAKE.
THAT'S VERY NICE, DARLING.
PLEASE, GO BACK INSIDE.
LEMONADE, HERE I MAKE.
LEMONADE FOR GUESTS.
NO, DARLING.
PLEASE.
I MADE CHOCOLATE CRACKER.
THANK YOU.
WE PUT CREAM ON ?
NO, NO !
IT'S FACE CREAM.
- FOR FACE.
- AH.
BOB, CYNTHIA, THANK YOU.
I LOVE LAMB WITH MERINGUE.
THANK YOU FOR THE COMPANY.
LIKE I SAID EARLIER,
NEW FACES ARE HARD
TO COME BY OUT HERE.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
OFF THE HIGHWAY ?
THAT'S A BLOODY GOOD QUESTION.
GLAD YOU BOTHERED.
WE DON'T GET YOUR TYPE
OUT HERE VERY OFTEN.
ME LIKE TO SING TOO.
ME LIKE.
PRETTY DAMN QUIET.
THOUGHT OF OPENING
A VIDEO BUSINESS FOR A WHILE.
I SUPPOSE WE GOT TO WAIT
TO GET TELEVISION FIRST.
ME PERFORM FOR YOU.
ME DANCE TOO.
MY WIFE USED TO BE
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.
YEAH.
YOU PERFORM HERE ?
ARE YOU THINKING
OF PERFORMING HERE ?
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE
AT LEAST ANOTHER NIGHT.
UM, THE THOUGHT HADN'T
REALLY CROSSED MY MIND.
I CAN HAVE A WORD
WITH WALLY AT THE PUB.
EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE IT.
I'M NOT SURE OUR SHOW
WOULD GO DOWN TOO WELL HERE.
WHAT KIND OF CABARET
DO YOU DO ?
WE DRESS UP IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES
AND PARADE AROUND,
MOUTHING THE WORDS
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS.
YOU MEAN LIKE THOSE, UM--
WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM ?
LES GIRLS ?
I'VE SEEN THEM, BACK IN SYDNEY
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BLOKE.
FANTASTIC.  JUST TERRIFIC.
BOB, YOU ARE LOOKING
AT PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS
LES GIRL EVER PRODUCED.
YOU'RE KIING ME.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I WAS NEVER
THAT FAMOUS.
I'M NOT JOKING.
WHAT ?  I WOULDN'T HAVE
REALLY SEEN YOU.  THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN 30 YEARS BACK.
-YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
- ME PERFORM FOR YOU.
ME SING.
NO, CYNTHIA.
YOU NO PERFORM.
THEY PERFORM,
NOT YOU.
WELL, A REAL LIVE
LES GIRLS SHOW.
THIS CALLS
FOR A CELEBRATION.
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
SHUT YOUR TWAT.
OUR FROCKS WERE THE SENSATION
OF BROKEN HILL, REMEMBER ?
THERE WAS A KMART
IN BROKEN HILL.
THEY KNEW
WHAT A FROCK WAS.
CHRIST, YOU SHOULD SEE
WHAT THIS WOMAN'S WEARING.
IT'S NOT A FROCK.
IT'S PIECE OF CORRUGATED IRON.
CAN I COME IN ?
ONLY IF YOU'RE SINGLE.
OH, YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.
WHERE DID WE
FIND THIS GUY ?
JUST KEEP DISHING OUT
THE COMPLIMENTS, BOB.
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
EVERYWHERE.  WHERE'S THAT
LOVELY WIFE OF YOURS ?
SHE'S AT HOME.
SHE'S NOT ALLOWED
IN THE PUB ANYMORE.
REALLY ?  WHY ?
SHE'S GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ALCOHOL.
EVERY TIME SHE GETS IN THE PUB,
SHE MAKES A FOOL OF HERSELF.
I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS.
WELL, WE'RE ALL WAITING.
YOU READY ?
BOB...
WE'RE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.
YOU CAN'T BACK OUT NOW.
EVERY MAN AND HIS DOG
IS OUT THERE.
THEY'RE NOT CHAINED UP,
BY ANY CHANCE ?
YOU BLOKES.
SORRY.  YOU GIRLS.
YOU'LL BE FINE.
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
THAT I'D LIKE TO DO
THAN TAKE THE FLOOR
AND DANCE WITH YOU
KEEP DANCING
LET'S KEEP DANCING
SHAKE IT
SHAKE IT
SHAKE IT
SHAKE IT
SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING
SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING
YEAH, YEAH
SHOW 'EM
HOW WE DO IT NOW
SHOW 'EM
HOW WE DO IT NOW
YEAH !
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON ?
OH, SHE'S NOT.
IS SHE ?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITH A PING-PONG BALL !
YOU WANT TO BET ?
-
-
-
-
LET GO OF ME !
I'M GOING !
DARLING, THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN'T WORK OUT.
YOU NO GOOD MAN.
NOW, DON'T BE SILLY.
YOU WANT GOOD WIFE,
YOU BE GOOD HUSBAND.
DARLING, DON'T GO.
I NO LIKE YOU ANYWAY.
YOU GOT LITTLE DING-A-LING.
SOMEDAYS YOU JUST
SHOULDN'T GET OUT OF BED.
IN MY OPINION, YOU SHOULD
WAIT HERE UNTIL I GET BACK
WITH THE NEW GAS TANK.
THEN AGAIN... YOU LISTENED
TO MY LAST OPINION.
FORGET IT, BOB.
IT'S TIME WE MADE A MOVE.
I'M JUST AN AMATEUR HERE.
THERE'S NO WAY A NICE FROCK
AND A CATCHY TUNE...
CAN COMPETE WITH THREE
PING-PONG BALLS, TWO CIGARETTES
AND A PINT OF BEER.
I'LL PLAY IT SAFE
AND STICK TO THE MAIN DRAG.
PARDON THE PUN.
GOOD-BYE, BOB.
THANKS FOR A VERY
EDUCATIONAL STAY.
YES, I'D DO ANYTHING
TO OPEN A BOTTLE LIKE THAT.
BERNADETTE,
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR...
MEETING A MEMBER
OF LES GIRLS.
AND IT'S BEEN AN HONOR
TO MEET A GENTLEMAN.
BELIEVE ME, BOB,
THESE DAYS, GENTLEMEN ARE
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.
UNLIKE BLOODY DRAG QUEENS
WHO JUST KEEP BREEDING
LIKE RABBITS.
SAYONARA, SAYONARA
OH, FUCK IT !
BOB ?  FANCY A FREE RIDE
TO COOBER PEDY ?
NOW, LISTEN, BOB.
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.
WE WEAR FROCKS,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU WEAR THE PANTS.
RIGHT.
WHERE DO I SLEEP ?
ANYWHERE THAT TAKES YOUR FANCY.
THE ROOF WILL DO ME FINE.
THANK YOU, BOB.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
MIGHT AS WELL GET THERE
A FEW DAYS EARLIER.
A BIT OF R AND R.
GOD KNOWS I NEED IT.
CAN I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION ?
I MEAN,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
SURE.
WHY ?  WHY DO YOU...
YOU KNOW ?
YOU MEAN
THE $64,000 QUESTION ?
THAT'S A GIRL.
DON'T TEAR THE WRAPPING PAPER.
SLIDE THE RIBBON OFF
AND WE CAN SEE WHAT
SANTA'S BROUGHT YOU.
HERE IT COMES.
WHAT IS IT ?
OH, IT'S A...
IT'S A--
CEMENT MIXER.
HAVE YOU BEEN CHANGING
THE CARDS AROUND AGAIN,
RALPH ?
I HAD NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER.
OW !  FOR FUCK'S SAKE !
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE DRIVING,
YOU STUPID BITCH !
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
FUCKING KILL ME OR SOMETHING ?
MY FAULT !
SORRY, BOB.
I THOUGHT IT WAS BERNADETTE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
TWO, TWO, THREE.
THREE, TWO, THREE.
NOW, YOU'RE GETTING IT.
WHO TAUGHT
YOU TO WALTZ ?
MY WIFE.
HOW SWEET.
YOU AND THE MISSUS...
DOWN AT ARTHUR MURRAY'S
EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT
PRACTICING YOUR HEARTS OUT.
MAKES ME WANT
TO SICK UP.
SHE'S
A BETTER DANCER THAN YOU.
MARRIED ?
YES, MARRIED.
WE'VE ONLY RECENTLY
DISCOVERED YOUNG ANTHONY
BATS FOR BOTH TEAMS.
I DO NOT.
OH, SO,
WE'RE STRAIGHT ?
NO.
OH, WE'RE NOT.
SO WE'RE A DONUT PUNCHER
AFTER ALL ?
NO.
THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE WE ?
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.
WHAT THE FUCK'S THAT ?
GOOD EVENING.
NICE NIGHT FOR IT.
OH.  OKAY,
GOOD NIGHT THEN.
WHAT A RUDE WOMAN.
AND THAT'S
THE POWER-STEERING PUMP.
THAT'S THE RADIATOR FAN.
HOW INTERESTING.
SIMPLE.
OH, YEA !
HEY, WHO WANTS FIRST BATH ?
I WON !
CAN I HELP YOU, MA'AM ?
OKAY,
TURN HER OVER !
BUT I CAN'T GET
MY OWN WAY
WITH THAT DOGGONE
SALE BUM
I DON'T CARE
IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE
I GET MY LOVIN'
IN THE EVENIN' TIME
WHEN I'M WITH MY BABY
IT'S NO FUN
WITH THE SUN AROUND
BUT I GET GOING
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
AND I MEET MY BABY
THAT'S WHEN WE KISS
AND KISS AND KISS
AND THEN WE KISS SOME MORE
DON'T ASK
HOW MANY TIMES WE KISS
AT A TIME LIKE THIS
WHO KEEPS SCORE
SO I DON'T CARE
IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE
I'LL GET MY LOVIN'
IN THE EVENIN' TIME
WHEN I'M WITH MY BABY
THAT'S IT OVER THERE.
IT'S AN OKAY ROOM WITH A SHOWER.
BATHE FIRST !
IS HOT WATER ALL
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ?
NO.  A SHOWER, COMFORTABLE BED
AND A NICE MEAL WILL DO ME FINE.
IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA WATCH TELEVISION,
YOU GOT ANOTHER THINK COMING.
YOU BLOKES
WATCH YOUR BACK.
THIS IS A PRETTY TOUGH TOWN.
THEY GET UP, GO DOWN A HOLE,
BLOW THINGS UP
AND COME UP AGAIN.
THAT SUMS
THINGS UP.
FABULOUS.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO HANG OUT
WITH US, BOB, IF YOU'VE
NOTHING BETTER TO DO.
YEAH.  I'M MEETING
SOME OF THE BOYS FOR A BOOZE-UP
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
I WANT TO GO WITH BOB !
I WANT TO GO
TO THE BOYS' CLUB !
YOU'LL HAVE SUPPER
WITH US, ADAM, OR STAY
IN YOUR ROOM AND WATCH TV.
HA !
HE'S A GOOD MAN,
OUR BOB.
YEAH.
NOT MY TYPE THOUGH.
DON'T COME THE RAW PRAWN
WITH ME.
I CAN SPOT THE FLUTTERING
OF A BEADED LASH FROM 300 PACES.
OH, GET OUT.
HE'S FAR TOO OLD.
MIND YOU, SO AM I.
MM-HMM.
DID YOU CATCH THAT
MAIL-ORDER BRIDE ?
WHY DID HE MARRY ?
I'M DYING TO ASK.
WHOOPS.  SORRY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE THE WORLD'S
BEST HUSBAND...
AND GIVEN THE CHANCE,
A PERFECTLY
GOOD FATHER, TOO.
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO ?
WHY ?  THINKING
ABOUT CHILDREN ?
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
UM, DO YOU HAVE
THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASCARA ?
YOU EVER WANTED KIDS ?
SURE, BUT I'VE LEARNED
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
DO YOU THINK AN OLD QUEEN'S
CAPABLE OF RAISING A CHILD ?
WELL, ELIZABETH DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB.
PRINCE CHARLES
IS A WONDERFUL BOY.
EDWARD'S STILL
A BIT OF A WORRY.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY
TURN OUT LIKE ADAM ?
YOU STUFF THEM BACK IN
AND ASK FOR A REFUND.
STUPID LITTLE SHIT.
I DREAD TO THINK
WHAT HE'S UP TO.
HELLO.
I'M NEW IN TOWN.
NO KIING.
COULD I HAVE
A BLOODY MARY, PLEASE ?
IT'S A BEER OR NOTHING...
SWEETHEART.
WELL, I BETTER HAVE
A BEER THEN.
CHEERS.
WHAT ARE YOU ALL
LOOKING AT ?
I'M SORRY.
WE DON'T MEAN
TO STARE.
WE DON'T USUALLY GET
WOMEN DOWN HERE.
OH.
SO WHAT DO WOMEN
DO AROUND HERE
BESIDES WATCHING VIDEOS ?
WELL, WELL, WELL !
LOOK WHO WE HAVE HERE.
YOU KNOW THAT BLOKE,
DO YOU ?
NO.
SO, WHO'S GONNA
SHOW ME THE SIGHTS ?
BE MY PLEASURE.
OH.
SO HOW ABOUT IT ?
WELL, I SUPPOSE A FUCK'S
NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION.
GET HER, FRANK !
COME ON, BOYS !
COME ON, BOYS !
WHO WANTS TO SEE
MY MAP OF TASMANIA ?
SO I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO TELL MY PARENTS...
WHAT A WONDERFUL
CHILDHOOD I'D HAD.
THEY NEVER SPOKE
TO ME AGAIN AFTER
I'D HAD... THE CHOP.
I THINK I HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
OH, SHIT.
AFTER HIM !
OKAY, FELLAS.
LET'S NOT FORGET
HOW TO TREAT A LADY.
YOU FUCKING FREAK !
GIVE IT TO HIM, FRANK.
HOLD HIM DOWN.
SPREAD HIS LEGS.
NO !  PLEASE !
FRANK, STOP !
STOP !
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING ?
YOU MEAN, YOU DO KNOW
THIS COCKSUCKER.
GET OFF HIM,
YOU MONGREL !
HE WAS JOKING, OKAY ?
NOW LEAVE THE LITTLE BUGGER
ALONE !
- GET OUT OF THERE, BOB.
- CUT IT OUT, FRANK.
PUT THE FAGGOT DOWN
AND GET OUT OF THERE,
OR YOU'LL BE NEXT !
- FRANK.
- GET OUT OF THERE !
STOP FLEXING YOUR MUSCLES,
YOU PILE OF BUDGIE TURD.
I'M SURE YOUR MATES
WILL BE MUCH MORE IMPRESSED
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE PUB...
AND FUCK A COUPLE OF PIGS
ON THE BAR.
BERNADETTE, PLEASE.
"BERNADETTE" ?
WELL, I'LL BE DARNED.
THE WHOLE CIRCUS IS IN TOWN.
WELL, I SUPPOSE
YOU WANT TO FUCK TOO, DO YOU ?
COME ON, BERNADETTE.
COME AND FUCK ME.
THAT'S IT.
COME ON.
COME AND FUCK ME.
COME ON.
FUCK ME.
THERE.
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED.
YOU STUPID IDIOT !
DRUGS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE !
WELL,
THREE CHEERS FOR YOU !
I HOPE YOU'RE
BLOODY WELL HAPPY NOW !
WHAT A FUCKWIT !
IT'S FUNNY.
WE ALL SIT AROUND
MINDLESSLY SLAGGING OFF...
THAT VILE STINKHOLE
OF A CITY...
BUT IN SOME STRANGE WAY,
IT TAKES CARE OF US.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
UGLY WALL OF SUBURBIA
HAS BEEN PUT THERE...
TO STOP THEM GETTING IN
OR US GETTING OUT.
COME ON.
DON'T LET IT
DRAG YOU DOWN.
LET IT TOUGHEN YOU UP.
I CAN ONLY FIGHT
BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED TO.
BEING A MAN ONE DAY
AND A WOMAN THE NEXT
IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.
SORRY.
CAN'T HELP YOU.
NO WORRIES, MATE.
ARE WE BUNNY HOPPING
ALL THE WAY TO ALICE ?
NO GOOD.  HE SAYS
THE MAN TO HELP IS
A FAIR WAY OUT OF TOWN.
LIKE HOW FAIR ?
COUPLE HUNDRED
CLICKS FAIR.
NO MATTER.
GOT NOTHING ELSE
TO DO TODAY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
COME ON, ADAM.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
A FINE ROMANCE
WITH NO KISSES
A FINE ROMANCE
MY FRIEND MISSES
WE SHOULD BE LIKE A COUPLE
OF HOT TOMATOES
SOME THINGS ARE SAID
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.
I'M SORRY I GOT ANGRY
WITH YOU LAST NIGHT...
ALTHOUGH, I DARESAY,
YOU DESERVED IT.
ANYWAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
QUITE AN EXPERIENCE,
SITTING HERE WITH YOU NOW.
I CAN QUITE SAFELY SAY...
I THINK YOUR TASTE IN CLOTHING
IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE...
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY A WORD,
CAN YOU ?
- OH, THIS IS GREAT FUN !
-
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A PROBLEM FINDING THIS GUY
WITH A TANK, AREN'T WE ?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?
BECAUSE
HE'S NOT OUT HERE.
HE'S OUT HERE.
HE'S IN ALICE.
WELL, I CAN'T GO BACK
TO COOBER PEDY FOR A WHILE.
NOT THE MOST POPULAR
BLOKE IN THE WORLD
BACK THERE ANYMORE.
HELLO.
HELLO.
WHO ARE YOU ?
I YOUR WIFE.
BEST I BE
GOING HOME, THEN.
NO, YOU NO GOING !
I COMING TOO !  I YOUR WIFE !
SEE ?  I YOUR WIFE !
SILLY GIRL.
SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE
HER HOMEWORK BETTER.
SHE THOUGHT
I WAS FROM SYDNEY.
WHY IN GOD'S NAME
DID YOU BRING HER HOME ?
SHE WAS ME WIFE.
COULDN'T YOU
SELL HER OFF ?
OH, THE PARTY'S OVER,
EVERYONE.  IT TALKS.
CAN'T KEEP
A GOOD BITCH DOWN.
WHAT TIME DO YOU RECKON
WE'LL BE IN ALICE SPRINGS ?
LATE TOMORROW.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE STAYING ?
DON'T KNOW.
COUPLE DAYS, MAYBE.
HEY, BIG DAY
FOR YOU TOMORROW.
WE ALL GET
TO MEET THE MISSUS.
I SAW THAT SMILE,
FELICIA.
ONE DEROGATORY WORD,
AND I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
BACK TO YOUR MATE...
IN COOBER PEDY.
PLEASE, EVERYONE,
TOMORROW'S GONNA BE TOUGH.
DON'T MAKE IT ANY HARDER.
WE'RE ONLY TEASING.
WE WON'T OPEN OUR MOUTHS
UNTIL YOU GIVE THE WORD.
THEN IT'S OPEN SEASON.
OH, WELL, TIME FOR BED.
I'VE GOT TO LOOK GOOD
FOR THE WIFE IN THE MORNING.
COME ALONG, ADAM.
TIME FOR YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP.
COME ON.
WILL YOU TWO
BE JOINING US ?
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D HAVE ONE
FOR THE ROAD.
HOW ABOUT YOU, BOB ?
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
GOOD NIGHT.
ANOTHER PIECE
OF CAKE, BOB ?
UH, NO.
OH.
SO...
TELL ME ABOUT YOU.
CAN'T COMPLAIN.
LIFE'S A LOT SIMPLER NOW.
I SPENT
AROUND THE WORLD...
ONLY TO FIND THAT
I WAS BETTER OFF
WHERE I STARTED.
NOT MUCH,
BUT IT'S MY TURF.
OOH, SHIT.
ADAM !
ADAM !
WHAT ?
GUESS WHO DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.
I'VE WAITED ALL MY LIFE
FOR THIS.
BERNICE HAS LEFT
HER CAKE OUT IN THE RAIN.
HAVAH NAGILAH

PLANNING ON STAYING
AT THE HOTEL ?
SORRY.

OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
GO THROUGH TO RECEPTION
AND THEY'LL TAKE YOU
RIGHT THROUGH.
THANKS.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, LENNY.
IT'S THE DRAG QUEENS.
COME ON, BOB.
LET'S GO TRY ON YOUR FROCK.
G'DAY.
JUST OVER THERE
BY THE BACK BAR.
THANKS.
NO, THOSE THREE KEGS
DIDN'T ARRIVE.
I NEED THEM TODAY.
NOT TOMORROW, BUT TODAY.
YOU'RE A DOLL.
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.
MY GOD !
HUSBAND, HUSBAND, IT'S
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU !
HIYA, WIFE.
YOU'RE A DAY LATE.
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS ?
THEY'RE OUTSIDE.
YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT,
YOU ROTTEN OLD QUEER.
IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME.
I CAN FINALLY GET INTO
THAT OLD ONE-PIECE OF YOURS,
THE ONE WITH THE SUNFLOWERS.
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT ?
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT ?
THE POSEIDON ADVENTUREROUTINE.
SHELLY WINTERS.
WHERE IS HE ?
I'M VERY, VERY ANGRY WITH YOU.
THERE'S ONE THING
I'D LIKE TO DO TO YOU:
A GOOD SPANKING.
YOU CAN GET IT.
SPANK, SPANK, SPANK.
I'VE A GOOD MIND TO PUT YOU
OVER MY KNEE.
I'LL SPANK-SPANK YOU BACK.
BENJ...
DO YOU REMEMBER TICK ?
HELLO, TICK.
HELLO.

CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A BOY.
SHIT !

WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
OH, MY GOD.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, MITZ,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ?
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO SHOCK ME LIKE THAT ?
THIS LUMP ON MY HEAD
IS GETTING BIGGER BY THE SECOND.
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE
MY NORTHERN TERRITORIES DEBUT...
LOOKING LIKE A FUCKING
CARTOON CHARACTER HAS HIT ME
OVER THE HEAD WITH AN IRON.
I THINK YOU LOOK MORE
LIKE A DISNEY WITCH.
SHUT YOUR FACE, FELICIA.
AT LEAST I DON'T LOOK
LIKE SOMEBODY'S TRIED TO OPEN
A CAN OF BEANS WITH MY FACE.
SORRY, GIRLS.
I COULDN'T STAND YOU BAGGING ME
ON THE BUS FOR TWO WEEKS.
ANYWAY, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE NOW ?
ABOUT TWO INCHES
TO MY HEAD.
DID YOU GET A LOOK AT HIM ?
HE'S GOT MY PROFILE.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.
I HATE TO BE PRACTICAL HERE,
BUT DOES HE KNOW WHO YOU ARE ?
DOES HE KNOW WHAT YOU DO
FOR A LIVING ?
HE KNOWS HE HAS A FATHER
IN THE SHOW BUSINESS-
COSMETICS INDUSTRY.
OH, LORD,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
NO, YOU DON'T, SO STOP TRYING !
IT'LL BE FINE !
IT HAD BETTER BE.
HELLO !

FINALLY, IT HAS HAPPENED TO M
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE
AND I JUST CANNOT HIDE IT
FINALLY, OH, YEAH
YEAH
FINALLY, OH, YEAH
COME ON, EVERYBODY !
YES !  MORE, MORE !  COME ON !
WE WANT MORE !
YES !  MAGNIFICENT !
BRAVO !  MORE !
WE WANT MORE !
COME ON.
SNAP OUT OF IT.
COME ON, MATE.
YOU'LL BE FINE.
COME ON, LOVE.
THAT'S IT, MATE.
YOU SCARED US ALL
FOR A MINUTE.
YOU JUST HAD TO HAVE
THAT EXTRA ATTENTION.
NICE ONE, LOVEY.
NICE ONE.
SHIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MARION ?  YOU LIAR.
YOU TOLD ME
HE'D BE IN BED.
OH, SHUSH.
DRINK YOUR DAIQUIRI.
I HATE BLOODY DAIQUIRI.
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU LOVE DAIQUIRIS.
AT LEAST NOW I KNOW
WHY DRAG QUEENS DRINK
FROM SUCH BIG GLASSES:
TO MAKE THEIR HANDS
LOOK SMALLER.
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY TO THE BOY ?
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED.
I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.
REALLY ?
YES, YOU'RE JUST BEING
A DRAMA QUEEN.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DROP ALL THAT SHIT IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE A GOOD FATHER.
DON'T PRETEND TO BE SURPRISED.
I'VE KEPT MY END OF THE BARGAIN.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.
NOT FOREVER, MAYBE JUST
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
WHY NOW ?
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A HOLIDAY
IN EIGHT YEARS.
I NEED A REST, TICK.
I NEED SOME SPACE.
REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING
I SAID NOT SO LONG AGO.
WELL, I DO.
BESIDES, IT'S TIME HE KNEW
WHO HIS FATHER WAS ANYWAY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL HIM.
WHAT DO YOU
ASSUME I DO, LIE ?
ASSUMPTION, MY DEAR MITZ,
IS THE MOTHER OF ALL FUCK-UPS.
DON'T BITCH TO ME.
BITCH TO HIM.
THANKS FOR THE FREE ADVICE.
YOU MIGHT BE IN
FOR A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
WHO IS IT ?
IT'S ME, BOB.
YOUR FLOWERS ARE BEING MANGLED.
THOUGHT I'D RESCUE THEM FOR YOU.
GOOD IDEA.
THANKS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
NOTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR FATHER
DOES FOR A LIVING ?
YEAH.
SO I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
HE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE GIRLS.
DOES HE HAVE A BOYFRIEND
AT THE MOMENT ?
NO.
NEITHER
DOES MUM.
SHE USED TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
BUT SHE GOT OVER HER.
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY IN MY ROOM ?
I'VE GOT LEGO.
SURE.
COME ON, BUTCH.
GET A MOVE ON.
WE CAN'T BRAND THE CATTLE
ALL BY OURSELVES.
GREAT SHOW LAST NIGHT.
DO YOU ALWAYS END THE NUMBER
LIKE THAT ?
ALWAYS.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PICK HER UP
EVERY NIGHT ?
BE A PLEASURE.
I THINK THAT MIGHT INCLUDE
TAKING THE LADY HOME...
AND TUCKING HER
INTO BED, JEFF.
WHAT'S THE PAY LIKE, MARION ?
OOH, THAT ONE'S
GONNA GET HIMSELF
INTO TROUBLE ONE DAY.
IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
YOU MIGHT BE THE LUCKY FELLOW.
COME ON, ALL ABOARD.
SO TAKE A LETTER, MARIA
ARESS IT TO MY WIFE
JUST WATCH IT WITH
THE INNUENDOS, MARION.
AT LEAST GIVE ME
A CLEAR SHOT AT THIS.
YOU CALL DRESSING UP LIKE
A XANADU PRODUCTION NUMBER
A CLEAR SHOT ?
COME ON, TICK.
WHO'S KIING WHO AROUND HERE ?
HE SURE AS SHIT ISN'T.
SEND A COPY TO MY LAWYER
GOT TO START A NEW LIFE
YOU'VE BEEN MANY THINGS
BUT MOST OF ALL
A GOOD SECRETARY TO ME
WHAT AM I DOING ?
SWIMMING,
SWIMMING.
UM...
ALL RIGHT.
ROCK.  ROCK.
RIVER ROCK, UM--
OH, ROCK HUDSON !
YOU SILLY OLD FAG.
MY TURN, MY TURN.
OKAY, SMARTY-PANTS.
YOU GIVE IT A GO.
COME ON, THEN.
IT'S A--
PERSON.
A SEXY WOMAN.
A FAMOUS WOMAN.
OH, UH--
BABY.
ROCKING.
I KNOW THIS ONE.
RACE HORSE !
CAT.  SCARY CAT.
UH, SCARY MOOSE.
SCARY DOG.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
UH, LINDY CHAMBERLAIN.
THAT WAS APPALLING, BENJI.
WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT ?
MUM DID.
LIES, ALL LIES.
COME ON, ADAM.  UP.
TIME IS AGAINST US,
AND WE HAVE THINGS TO DO.
COME ON,
YOU BUTCH THING, YOU.
OH, NO, COUNT ME OUT.
ALL FOR ONE.
COME ON, TICK.
NO.
HMM.  COME ON, ADAM.
LET'S GET FROCKED.
SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO FINALLY HAVE A FATHER ?
IT'S OKAY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I DON'T ALWAYS DRESS UP
IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES.
I MEAN, DON'T GET
THE WRONG IDEA.
I MEAN, I DO A LOT
OF DIFFERENT STUFF...
LIKE... ELVIS...
AND GARY GLITTER.
ABBA ?
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE ABBA SHOW,
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SEE IT.
WOULD YOU DO ABBA FOR ME ?
SURE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM, DON'T YOU ?
MUM SAYS YOU'RE THE BEST
IN THE BUSINESS.
WELL, YOUR MOTHER WAS ALWAYS
PRONE TO EXAGGERATION.
WILL YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND
WHEN WE GET BACK TO SYDNEY ?
MAYBE.
THAT'S GOOD.
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE GOING ?
WE'RE GOING TO UNLEASH
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS !
I HAD A DREAM.
WELL, WE DID IT.
IT NEVER ENDS, DOES IT ?
ALL THAT SPACE.
SO, WHAT NOW ?
I THINK I WANT
TO GO HOME.
ME TOO.
WELL, THEN... LET'S FINISH
THE SHOWS AND GO HOME.
DON'T GO WITHOUT LEAVING ME
YOUR NUMBER, SUNSHINE.
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF, JEFF.
IT'S AT THE FAR END
OF THE MEN'S CUBICLE.
"FOR A GOOD TIME,
PHONE FELICIA."
CAN WE STOP
AT McDONALD'S ?
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH SHITTY FOOD.
FUCKING CRAYFISH.
WHERE THE HELL
DO YOU START ?
STOP IT.
LAY IT ON THE LINE.
DON'T CONCEAL A THING.
THAT'S THE KEY.
IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT,
STIFF BIKKIES.  HE CAN BUY
HIS OWN TICKET BACK.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WORD GETS OUT
THAT MITZI'S GOT A MINOR ?
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
NOT HIS.  HE KNOWS WHEN
AND WHERE TO LISTEN.
MORALS ARE A CHOICE,
AND HE'LL DECIDE HIS OWN
WHEN HE'S READY.
WELL, THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE ALL PACKED.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING.
WE HAVEN'T GOT BERNADETTE'S
SHOES UPON BOARD YET.
I HATE TO SAY THIS.
I WISH I WAS GOING WITH YOU.
YOUR GAS TANK WILL BE FINE.
YOUR AXLE MAY BE
ANOTHER MATTER.
I'M SURE THE ROAD HOME
WILL JUST BE FILLED
WITH BORED MECHANICS...
WAITING FOR A BUS
OF DRAG QUEENS
TO SPIRIT THEM AWAY.
OH, I WISH.
WE WON'T EVEN SPIRIT
GUM AT THIS RATE.
WHERE THE HELL
IS BERNADETTE ?
HERE.
COME ON, CABANOSSI TITS.
WHERE ARE YOUR BAGS ?
IN MY ROOM.
I'M NOT GOING.  I'VE DECIDED
TO STAY HERE FOR A WHILE.
OH, REALLY ?
AND YOU'RE CHOOSING
TO TELL US NOW ?
SHE TOLD ME A FEW WEEKS BACK,
JUST WHEN I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY TO HANDLE...
THE GUEST ENTERTAINMENT
WHILE I'M AWAY.
OH, I GET IT.
WHO'S BEEN PLAYING
HIDE THE SAUSAGE THEN ?
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I THROW UP.
COME ON, BENJ.
HOPE YOU CAN DRIVE.
NOT WITHOUT A HUG.
WHOA !
YOU SURE ?
NO, I'M NOT SURE.
BUT I'LL NEVER KNOW
UNLESS I GIVE IT A SHOT.
I'M AS JEALOUS AS ALL HELL.
SHIT.
RACCOON TIME AGAIN.
GOOD-BYE.
DON'T FORGET
TO WRITE.
LOVE YOU.
WISH I WAS STAYING.
BYE !  TAKE CARE OF HER.
BYE-BYE !  BYE, MOM !
BYE, RALPH !
YEAH, SEE YOU, RALPH !
I'VE BEEN CHEATED BY YOU
SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHEN
SO I MADE UP MY MIND
IT MUST COME TO AN END
LOOK AT ME NOW
WILL I EVER LEARN
I DON'T KNOW HOW
BUT I SUENLY
LOSE CONTROL
THERE'S A FIRE
WITHIN MY SOUL
JUST ONE LOOK
AND I CAN HEAR A BELL RING
ONE MORE LOOK
AND I FORGET EVERYTHING, OH
MAMMA MIA
HERE I GO AGAIN
MY, MY
HOW CAN I RESIST YOU
MAMMA MIA
DOES IT SHOW AGAIN
MY, MY
JUST HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU
YES, I'VE BEEN
BROKENHEARTED
BLUE SINCE THE DAY
WE PARTED
WHY, WHY
DID I EVER LET YOU GO
MAMMA MIA
NOW I REALLY KNOW
MY, MY
I COULD NEVER LET YOU GO
I'VE BEEN ANGRY AND SAD
ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU DO
I CAN'T COUNT
ALL THE TIMES THAT
I TOLD YOU WE'RE THROUGH
AND WHEN YOU GO
WHEN YOU SLAM THE DOOR
I THINK YOU KNOW
THAT YOU WON'T
BE AWAY TOO LONG
YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT THAT STRONG
JUST ONE LOOK
AND I CAN HEAR A BELL RING
ONE MORE LOOK AND I FORGET
EVERYTHING, WHOA-WHOA
MAMMA MIA
HERE I GO AGAIN
MY, MY
HOW CAN I RESIST YOU
MAMMA MIA
DOES IT SHOW AGAIN
MY, MY
JUST HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU
YES, I'VE BEEN
BROKENHEARTED
BLUE SINCE THE DAY
WE PARTED
WHY, WHY
DID I EVER LET YOU GO
MAMMA MIA
NOW I REALLY KNOW
MY, MY
I COULD NEVER LET YOU GO
NO, THAT'S ENOUGH.
OH, MY TITS ARE FALLING DOWN.
JESUS !
THANK YOU !  THANK YOU !
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME !
SOMETIMES THE SNOW
COMES DOWN IN JUNE
SOMETIMES THE SUN
GOES 'ROUND THE MOON
I SEE THE PASSION
IN YOUR EYES
SOMETIMES IT'S ALL
A BIG SURPRISE
'CAUSE THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN ALL I DID WAS WISH
YOU'D TELL ME
THIS WAS LOVE
IT'S NOT THE WAY I HOPED
OR HOW I PLANNED
BUT SOMEHOW IT'S ENOUGH
AND NOW WE'RE STANDING
FACE-TO-FACE
ISN'T THIS WORLD
A CRAZY PLACE
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
OUR CHANCE HAD PASSED
YOU GO AND SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST
ALL OF THE NIGHTS
YOU CAME TO ME
WHEN SOME SILLY GIRL
HAD SET YOU FREE
YOU WONDERED HOW
YOU'D MAKE IT THROUGH
I WONDERED
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU
'CAUSE HOW COULD YOU GIVE
YOUR LOVE TO SOMEONE ELSE
AND SHARE YOUR DREAMS
WITH ME
SOMETIMES THE VERY THING
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IS THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T SEE
BUT NOW WE'RE STANDING
FACE-TO-FACE
ISN'T THIS WORLD
A CRAZY PLACE
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
OUR CHANCE HAD PASSED
YOU GO AND SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST
SOMETIMES THE SNOW
COMES DOWN IN JUNE
SOMETIMES THE SUN
GOES 'ROUND THE MOON
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
OUR CHANCE HAD PASSED
YOU GO AND SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST
YOU WENT AND SAVED
THE BEST
FOR LAST
YEAH
