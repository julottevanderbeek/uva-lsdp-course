Goal....
- What, what was that? Ellie, did you hear that?
- I heard it Manny, whatever it is is miles away.
- Peaches, you alright?
Where is she, no teenager is ever up early.
- Nooo... easy warden,
she's not on lockdown.
- You two were supposed to be responsible uncles.
- What... I didn't see Peaches sneak
off maybe 15-20 minutes ago.
- Or that she went with Louis to the falls.
- The falls... where the deliquents go!
- Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.
- No, no... it's a gateway hangout.
First it's the falls then she's pucing
her trunk and the next thing you
know she's addicted to berries.
- Manny, you are over-reacting.
She's not going to be your little girl forever.
- I know, that's what worries me.
- C'mon...
Louis... would you get your head out of the ground for once and try to have a little fun.
- Ow... I'm a mole-hog, my head's
supposed to be underground and my idea
of fun isn't risking death so  you
can meet some cute mammoth.
- Ethan isn't cute... he's hot. Besides you can't spend you whole life playing it safe.
- I know I would.
- Dad!! There's no reason to be mad.
- You know how I feel about you
going into the falls, especially alone.
- Ahem... she's not alone sir.
- You don't count weiner.
- Yes, there's my place and he
just put me in it... thankyou.
- C'mon young lady we're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.
- So... should I just, um, wait here or...?
- Yeh you don't scare me mother nature, there's nothing you can throw at me that I can't handle.
- Whoohoo... I think we're almost there.
- We better be I've just lost the steering.
- Has anyone seen Precious, it's her feeding time.
- Mum, Granny's talking about her dead pet again.
- Hey, paws up everybody.
- Paws down, Uncle... please... that is nasty.
- Be careful Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody.
- Bad kitty...
- Rock...!
- Ok, so tell me when exactly will
I be allowed to hang out with boys?
- When I'm dead... plus 3 days
just to make sure I'm dead.
- Manny, are you ok...?
- Get off... my face.
- That was fun...
now, who should I eat first?
- Uncle Morgan, can that really be you?
- Hey... hey...
- Sorry, sorry...
- Mum, dad... pop.
Marshall...
- Hey...
- Granny?
- This rump is ripe for picking.
- Oh, my whole familiar.
- See, he still hugs his parents.
- I never thought I would see my little baby again, we've been searching everywhere for you.
- You have? I knew it, I knew it...
deep down I  knew I wasn't abandoned.
- Ahah that's incorrect, we totally abandoned you.
- But... we always missed you. Right...
- Yeh, right. Yeh, yeh, yeh... And we just knew Sid would want to see his poor dear Granny before... her time is up.
- I'll bury y'all and dance on your grave.
- So frail.
- And she can't wait to spend time with you Sid.
- Oh yeh... Granny, Granny?
- Oww...
- Granny...
- I don't get to have any fun.
- Why don't you show her your cave hmm...
yeh, she could use a  nap.
- Boy, there's so much to tell you. You know a lot has happened since the last time I saw you.
- Not interested.
- But we fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age...
didn't make sense but sure was exciting.
- We're getting rid of the crazy wretch, lets go...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't
just leave Sid'll be crushed. Whoa, whoa...
- Sorry cookie things are breaking apart back home.
- Nope, we're headed inland and Granny is just dead weight.
- See ya.
- And warn the community...
she tends to wander.
- Well that explains a lot about Sid.
- Mum... dad do you have
Granny's teeth, she can't find'em.
- Hey, can you chew this thing for me?
- Guys... where is everyone?
- I'll handle this.
Sid... your family was wiped out by an asteroid...
sorry.
- What...
- Ahem... what Diego is trying to say is... they left.
They only wanted to find you so
you could take care of Granny.
- Oh c'mon, c'mon what kind of sick family
would ditch their old Granny with someone...
that's just  crazy... that's just... that's just... my family.
- At least you still have Granny, right buddy.
- Yeh... Granny. Granny...? Granny...?
Wow, for an old girl she moves fast.
Granny...
- Granny...
- Granny.
- Come out, come out wherever you are.
- C'mon Granny.
- Here Granny, Granny... Granny... Granny... I have  prunes for ya. Just the way ya like them... Blehh...
- I... don't want to see that...
Huh...? Oh no...
- What if you dad finds out, I'm not as tough as I  look.
- Wait, sshhtt... do you hear that?
- Go long...
- Hey look, there's Ethan.
- Yaay.... Ethan...
You go boy....
- Yehh...
- See... fun, no danger.
- Check me out.
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not... fine.
I did not just do that, that was crazy.
- Nice...
- Isn't he perfect.
- Perfect... ehhh it, it's such a
strong word, maybe adequate.
- Who are we stalking, is it Ethan?
- I bet it's Ethan.
- Ok... we know...
- What are you guys doing here?
- Manny told us to keep an eye on you.
- But not to let you see us under any circumstances.
- Ohh... Stupid, stupid, stupid... stupid...
- Ok, I'm going for it. Do I look ok?... Louis.
- Ok doesn't even begin to cover it.
- Oh Louis, you're the greatest friend ever....
- Thats me.
- Hi Ethan, my name's Peaches... what's yours?  Oooh, what am I doing. Ok just be cool, just be cool...
- Yep hoho, that's intense.
- No, no, no... noooo....
- Gross, it's that weirdo that chills with possums.
- Whoa, what just happened?
- Oh no, Ethan I am so sorry I... Wow... even better looking up close, phenomenal, I mean...
- You have a twin sister?
- Am I interrupting something?
- Dad.
- Oh boy. Ok...
- Sorry, I just...
- Wait...
- No, you go...
- Move back, good...
- You, keep away from my daughter.
- Dad, nothing...
- And you, you're grounded.
- But I didn't...
- Grounded...
- Loser alert...
- Seriously, that's embarrassing...
- What a freak...
- Peaches.
Awww.... Peaches c'mon lets talk about this.
- How could you embarrass me in front of my friends.
- You deliberately went where you weren't supposed to.
- You can't control my life.
- I'm trying to protect you. That's what fathers do.
- Well... I wish you weren't my father.
- She's just upset honey.
Peaches it's not the end of the world.
- Whoa, excuse me.
- I don't think that was you.
- Oh what was that?
- I don't know. Stay there... I'll come to you.
Ellie...
- Manny...
No...
- Dad.
- Peaches, get back.
- Hurry dad hurry, hurry.
- Manny.
- Diego...
- You never would have made it.
- Ellie, behind you.
- What's happening?
- Go to the land-bridge,
you'll be safe on the other side.
- No Manny, no.
- I'll meet you there.
- Manny...... No...
- Ellie, you have to get out of here. Go! Go now!
- Mum...
- Get back... get back.
- Daddy....
- Stay alive.
No matter how long it takes... I will find you.
- Mum, this is all my fault. If I'd just...
- Peaches this is not your fault, ok.
- What if I never see him again and
the last thing we did was fight.
- Hey... your father is the toughest most
stubborn mammoth that I have ever met.
He'll come back for us... that's a promise.
- C'mon, help me turn this thing around.
- Everyone, please settle down... don't panic.
- Wait mum, where's Louis, we have to find him.
- Ok... fast.
- They need me, we've gotta get back.
- Buddy this thing's too big to turn,
the current's pulling us out.
- You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.
- Was this before she abandoned you?
- Yes it was... but the point being that even though things look bad there's a rainbow 'round  every corner.
It's nothing but smooth sailing ahead....
- Smooth sailing Sid?
- Louis... Louis...
- Louis...
- Weiner...
- Weiner...
- Weiner...
- Weiner...
- Louis where are you, come on we have to go.
- Louis.
- Peaches.
- Louis, you have to jump.
- No, no... save yourselves.
- We're not leaving without you
- I'll think on this.
- Jump...
- This is why I travel underground.
- Thanks for coming back.
- What do you mean, you don't leave a friend behind.
- Great, lets go.
That wall is going to keep moving and crush us.
We need to get to the land-bridge.
Any questions?
- Ooh Ooh...
- Yes?
- When you drink water through your
trunk does it taste like boogers?
- Ahhh.... no... well sometimes.
Lets move.
- Just keep your eye on the horizon.
- I can't find the horizon.
- Whoa...
- Holy crab...!
Hold me...
If I don't make it,
find me a wife and tell her I love her....
We made it. Come on ocean, is that the best
you can do... am I right buddy?
Hey... there really is a rainbow around every corner.
- Peaches.....!
You ok?
- I'm just so worried about my dad.
- Listen, we're gonna get to him. At this
pace we'll stay ahead of the wall and we'll
make it to the land-bridge before you know it.
We're all gonna survive this.
Ok, maybe they won't but everyone
else... totally fine.
- We're still heading away from home.
- Yeh but we survived and we still have each other. Things could be worse... right.
- For once, he's actually right.
We made it through storms and tidal-waves
and a vicious assortment of seafood...
what more can they hit us with?
Oww....
Hello.... What the...?
- Dag nabit, I'm trying to sleep.
- Granny... you're alive.
- And can we say how thrilled we are to see you.
- Hey fats, you wanna get me out of here....
- Whoo.
- Hey... pretend I'm a dessert...
that should motivate you.
- I can't believe this...
you slept through that storm.
- Aaahh, I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorn.
Thanks for drawin' my bath Sidney.
- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way, this is my first bath in decades.
- There's your proof.
- Quick, somebody do something.
I got you Granny.
- Get off'a me.
- Granny...
- What are you peepin' toms all lookin' at?
Lady can't take a bath in peace.
I'll wallop you with a wallop you...
- What's the life expectancy of a female sloth?
- Oh , she'll outlive us all you know that, right. Yeh, the spiteful ones live the longest.
- How big is this ocean?
- Water, water... everywhere. Not a drop to drink.
Uh, except maybe that drop.
Hmm that's a little.... salty...
- Precious... mummy's calling you...
Precious... Precious sweety...
Hey lady... have you seen Precious?
- If you mean the imaginary or perhaps deceased pet that you keep searching for... No... I haven't.
- Guys, look... where there's birds there's land, right?
- Hey buddy, come here.
- No wait, wait... come back.
Come back.
- It's a huge bounty Capitan, four passengers
ripe for the taking. One very smelly and one very plump.
- In my ocean... what a terrible turn
of events. I love a terrible turn of events.
- Am I hallucinating or is that ice
coming straight towards us.
- Yeh, yeh, it's coming. It sounds
like there's animals on it.
- Yippee... we're being rescued,
we're being rescued.
- I hear laughter.
- Oooh, must be a party cruise.
- Hey, they look fluffy.
- I get the big woolly one.
- Wow...
- Get ready to slice and dice boys.
- Knock it off Squint, wait for Captains' orders.
- Ahoy down there... how lucky are you. Do you know these waters are infested with pirates, right boys...
Glad we found you before they did.
Captain Gutt here to help.
- You know, that's a nice monkey.
- Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.
- The continent... that pile of rubble...
- My family's there so if you could just...
- Awww, your family... that is so sweet. I hope you said goodbye because there's no way back.
- Yes there is... don't you remember Captain. You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch a current back from there.
Haha, steel-trap this noggin' is...
- Hahaha... thankyou Mr. Flynn.
- Oww.....
- See, I knew there was a way home.
- There is no home...
...there is only here and here,
your ship belongs to me...
Battle Stations...!!
- Fly the Colours...!!
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.
- Or face your furry what?
- Not furry... fury.
Fire!
- Hit the mast... win a prize.
- Fire the starboard cannon.
- I... love... this... job...!
- Shira... fetch.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Aww, you almost made it.
- I don't fight girls.
- Huhhuh... I can see why.
- Belly-flop...
- Lets rumba tiny...
- Lights out big-fella...
- Hello.
- Hey buddy... welcome to the party.
- Lets see what kinda moves you got.
Dance little scrab-fish.
- Dodge the coconut ball...
- Happy days.... Oohmm...
Oohh... look at him.
Where's my booty, has anyone seen it?
- Flynn, it's right behind you.
- Where? Where's my booty. I can't see it.
- Yuk... it's all I can see.
- Ooh, this is a lovely vacation...
best I've ever had.
- Mornin' sunshine... let me be the first to
extend a hand of friendship.
- That's your foot.
- Hohoho... nothing gets by you, does it.
- What do you want?
- I bet you're feeling lost... scared...
confused. Allow me to explain.
Help me out boys...
- Oooh, Captains' going to sing a shanty...
- Aye, aye,  Captain Gutts...
- Aww... jeeez...
- Kill them? Hoho, me? No, no... well,
at least not this very large, useful mammoth.
- Hey, hands off.
- Anyway...
- We really should be leaving...
- We gotta get going...
- How I wish we could be staying...
- Oh please...
- Good shanty sir...
Captain Gutt... really? You know, I have a little paunch too but ahh... I wouldn't name myself after it.
- Thats funny... you're a funny guy.
But that's not how I got my name...
These... got me my name.
- I don't get it.
- No? Ok, let me give you a visual aid.
I just gently press here...
- It tickles.
- And go down like this...
- And then your innards become your outs...
- Um, I still don't get it.
- Look, as much as I'm tempted to join a monkey, the Easter Bunny and a giant bag of pudding... I'll pass.
No one's gonna stop me getting back to my family.
- I'm gonna lambado your liver buddy.
Let me at him.
- That family is going to be the death of you.
First mate, jettison the dead weight.
- Aye, aye sir. Prepare the plank
- Prepare the plank.
- Preparing the plank.
- Heh...
- Ow.... What, you want me to walk into the water?
I can't because I ate less than 20 mins
ago and you know the rule.
- That's a myth...
- Oh ok, as long as it's safe.
- Wait...
- Thank goodness.
- Dump the wench too...
Ladies first.
- Such a nice boy.
Why can't you be more like him Sidney.
- Granny... no, wait...
- Manny... get me to the vine.
- Yeh, yeh, got it.
- Hmmhmmhmm... hmhmhm. you'all
got some ugly goldfish.
- C'mon, a little bit more.
- Hmm? No...!
- Take that mammoth.
- Go on Manny, kick that monkeys' butt...
- Look at you, 11 tons of land-lubber flubber.
- Hey, I'm not fat... I'm poomfy...
- Too bad tubby... I could have used you.
- Ain't gonna happen Captain.
- I got you Granny.
- Giddee up, lets go.
- Can anyone have bounties.
- No, my bounty...
- They sank our battleship, what are
we gonna do... we're all gonna drown.
- You're a sea creature you idiot.
- Oh... Quite... sir.
- Should I flag a white Captain?
- No...!
- Wait, what about Shira?
- What about her.
- Yeh, what about her.
- Anyone else want to play Captain?
...Good.
- Now come on blubber-brain, swim.
- Hey... Gutt... Flynn... anyone there?
- Here, grab hold.
- No, go away... I'd rather drown.
- Whatever the lady wants.
- I said I didn't need your help.
- Your welcome...
wassup... care to join our scurvy crew.
- Two sloths, a mammoth and a sabre?
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.
- And we saved you... that makes
you the punchline... kitty.
- Don't... call me kitty.
- Ok I won't...
...kitty.
- If they kiss I'm gonna puke.
- What? Wait... no...
- I don't think we're ever going to get there?
- Maybe we should rest for a few hours.
- Night Alex...
- I miss you dad.
- Well that's something you don't see everyday.
- Ethan... Hi....
Meant... to do that.
- I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.
- What... No... This just helps me think.
It gets the blood to the old noggin'
and away from the old... whatever.
- Ahh... ok, that's a little weird.
So, how you doing... you know, with all of this.
- Honestly, a little scared. Ok, a lot scared.
Everything we knew is gone.
- Yeah, I was pretty scared too. I mean, not scared... you know, like concerned.
Hey, um, do you want to walk with me tomorrow? Try and get our minds off all of this stuff.
- You want to walk with me.
- Well, you did almost flatten me this morning so I figure it can't really go worse than that, right.
- Yeah...
- Oh, just one thing, totally no big deal but... you might want to lose the mohawk.
- Louis... yeah, sure... not a problem.
Aahhh... wow...
- Someone looks happy.
- Ethan's great isn't he.
- Baby, I know you like this one but just don't let anyone change who you are, ok.
- I know.
- You coming up?
- I think I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
- Ok... night baby.
- Night mum... Night dad.
- Hey, chew this sandwich for me.
- Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us.
- Aaah, they think that we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.
- It's a rat...
- Screw-up.
- Oh Sid...
- Never make home on this thing.
- Huh well, maybe you should have thought of that before you capsized our 'berg genius.
- Yeh, trying to escape.
- Wimp...
- Whiner...
- Crybaby...
- Land...!
- Yeah, land... Wait. What?
- Not her... there!
Land!!
Everyone paddle, paddle.
- Food... Aww, I miss you so much.
Look at me, I've wasted away.
- Ok, snack time's over. We gotta build a raft.
- Manny...
- Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.
- Go get her, she can help us get back.
- Shira...
- Gotcha...
Ohh....
- Let go of me.
- Where do you think you're going?
Whoa....
Switchback Cove... it's the way home.
Oh... no...
- You call this a ship you miserable runts?
- Yeh you little runts... get to work.
- Faster you worthless worthy sons of
sorry excuses for shark-bait weevils..
- What did he say?
- I dunno...
- Now get this chunk of ice seaworthy by
sundown or I will keel-haul the lot of you.
- So, what do you think.
- Two words... Anger... Management.
- I'm talking about the current...
Diego's right, we've found a way home.
- Yes that's great... too bad
we don't have a ship.
- Sure we do, it's right there.
- Yeh well...
- Guys... sssshh... the trees have ears.
- Wait a minute, maybe we can
help each other.
Hey little fellas. Hey, come on out. No, no, no. no, it's ok, we're not gonna hurt ya.
How about you and us against
the pirates, huh?
You got no idea what I'm saying do ya.
Ok, ahh... ship me want.

Sick sloths sip broth...
Sick sloths sip broth...
- That they got...?
- Yep... they're ready.
- Great, we'll free your buddies we can all work together to kick a little pirate booty.
- Easy kitty... water... you need it.
- I don't need anything from you.
- Fine, die of thirst that'll really show me.
- Wait. I'll take it... thankyou.
- You know, you have a way of saying thankyou that makes it sound like drop dead.
- It's a gift. You're pretty soft... for a sabre.
- Excuse me... I am not soft ok, I happen
to be a remorseless assassin.
- Diego-poo... hey, I made you another
coral necklace... he keeps losing them.
- Yeah, I think I get why I'm starting
to get why you're not in a pack.
- Listen I chose to leave my pack, alright.
- Congratulations warrior princess, so did I.
- Really?
- What?
- Nothing... I just... I know how hard that is... walking away from everthing you know.
- Oh great... what, are we going
to braid each others fur now?
- Funny, really funny. Can I tell you
the difference between you and me.
- I won't still be wearing their necklace.
- No. We both might have wanted
out of our pack-life but at least
I didn't trade one pack-life for
another. I got something more.
- Oh yeah... what's that.
- A herd...
- What's the difference?
- We have each others backs.
- Gutt has my back. I'm his First Mate.
- Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.
- You know you won't beat him. Your big furry friend over there, he has no idea what he's up against.
- Yeah, but neither does Gutt.
- With the vines, don't let go until
we're all on board.
Ok, we need precision timing from
everyone to get that ship.
Half-pint, you've got your end covered, right.
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Diego...
- I'll free his little friends.
- Sid and Granny...
- Sir, untie the ship... sir.
- Right, unwind the vines... don't let go until we're all on board. We're relying on you Sid... you got that.
- Yes sir, totally focussed sir.
- Don't worry, it'll be easy since we
don't have to guard Shira anymore.
- We need to move... now.
- Batten down the hatches.
Brad, hoist the anchor.
And Gumpta, fly the colours.
- More sports, Captain.
- We'll settin' sail for vengance lads.
- Whoo... I love vengance.
- Captain...
- Shira... Oh what a relief, I'd thought we'd lost you.
- The mammoth, he washed ashore with me... He's...
- What, he's here... Did you sink your
fangs into him? Did he beg for his life?
- No, the sabre took me down.
- Whaa... you're a failure. I need warriors and all I have are kitty cats and bunny rabbits
- And a seal and a kangaroo...
- You take the sabre down or you
die trying... no excuses.
- Yes Captain.
- Mr. Squint...
- Aye sir...
- You're First Mate now.
- Yohoho and a bottle of who-with-me Captain. Out of my way sailor... you answer to me now.
- Gutt listen... he's coming for the...
- Huh....?
- Grab your weapons mates.
- Yes...
- A spoon Flynn?
- No...
- Follow me...
- Let me at him...
- Yeh, it's their turn now...
- Guys, it's not necessary really.
And yeah, I love you too. Yeah...
- Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up...
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let... oh, yummo.
- Sid, no, it's a lolus berry, it'll paralyse you.
- Oh please... I know my berries.
- Don't.... swallow...
- I'm fine, if there's one thing I know
it's berries... Oh oh...
- Yeah, finally...
Who's the Easter bunny now.
- It worked... he bought it.
- C'mon.
- Oh no... it's been a diversion.
- Oh no... I'm having a blast.
- No pinhead, they're stealing my ship.
- One thing Sid... you couldn't do one thing. Look at you... Sid can you hear me.
- Bye bye...
- Say something buddy.
- Whoa...
lets go...
- The ship... c'mon, we've got
to catch it before it hits open water.
Sorry, I'll hold you higher... Sorry... Sorry...
- Say adieu mammoth....
- Owww...
- Sorry buddy.
I'm coming Sid.
I gotya... I gotcha... gotcha...
- I'm coming for you mammoth.
- Diego, c'mon...
C'mon move it.
- Why are you doing this?
- You don't understand I don't have a choice.
- You don't have to live this was Shira... you'll be safe with us. We take care of each other.
- Diego... I can't hold on much longer....
Diego...
- Come with us... come with me.
- What are you doing?
- I've got your back...
- So long banana breath...
Thanks for the ship.
- Oh no, he's gone forever... Oh, there he is.
- Shore leave's over. Get your sorry
carcasses on board... now.
- Gutt, I can explain.
- When this ends, I'll have a tiger skin
hanging on my wall. I don't care who's...
That mammoth has taken my ship,
my bounty and now the loyalty of my crew.
I will destroy him and everything he loves.
- Wait for it... wait for it....
That was awesome.
- Can I ask you guys something.
How are you both so happy,
doesn't it weigh on you that
the world might be ending...
- Can I tell him our secret?... Come here... come here... we're very, very stupid.
- But still, you're not a tinsy bit concerned
about... I don't know, say imminent death!
- Beep...
- I'm gonna go find Peaches.
- Hey guys over here, c'mon it's a
short-cut. You're gonna love this...
- C'mon guys, lets have some fun...
- Oooh, wow, this is so cool...
it's like we're upside down.
- That is amazing...
- Echo...
- Huh...?
- Too bad your mohawk friend isn't here, huh.
- You're not really friends with him are you?
- Yeah, come clean Peaches.
- Are you friends with that awful little rodent or not?
- I mean Louis and I we hang out... or whatever. But no, we're not really friend friends.
- Not friends...
- Louis... I...
- Busted...
- I mean...
- Good to know.
- Louis... wait.
- Oww...
- Haha... he even runs away like a loser.
- Whoa Peaches, don't stress... you're with us now.
- Yeah, stress is so... stressful.
- Yeah girl, if you want to stress it out like that...
- Err, guys... we should get outta here.
- Are you kidding, this is epic.
- Go, go, go...
- Yeah...
- How sick was that... Yo, that was insane. Hey Peach loosen up... have some fun.
- Fun...! You call that fun... I'm outta here,
- Come on, I mean... do you really want to go back
to hanging out with a weird mole hog for
a week than getting along with us.
- I mean, it's bad enough that your
family's half possum...
- Bad enough...? There's nothing bad
about being part of my family.
I make like hanging by my tail and if you genious's are normal the species is going to end up extinct.
- Ah, yeah. Well your species is going to be extinct first.
- Haha, Burrrnnn....
- We're the same species genious.
- What.... double burrrnnn.
- Hey, I can wriggle my toe again... the important one... the little piggy who went to market.
Wait, I'm talking again. Oh, I had so many things trapped inside of me that I couldn't say
... like "Hey, I'm not dead..."
and why'd it hurt me in the eye but not in an ear.
- I'll push him overboard, you guys
say it was an accident.
- And why do males have nipples?
- I'm in... how about you Diego.
Diego... Hey relax buddy Captain Crazy and his floating petting zoo are history. C'mon, we're finally heading home.
- I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't eat, can't sleep... Maybe I'm coming down with something.
- Hohohoo... I know what you've got.... The "L" word.
- Yeah, leprosy.
- No Sid, no. It's four letters, starts with L ends with E.
- Ahha, lice...
- No... Diego, my friend, is in love.
- Oh yeah... Love.
- You mean with the pirate?... No.
- Oh, Shira's gotten under your skin, c'mon admit it.
- A rugged sabre like you...
- A more rugged sabre like her...
- No, no, no, you guys are dead wrong.
- Denial is the clincher... You're in love pussycat.
- Diego and Shira sitting in a tree,
K.I.S.S.I.N.G...

- Real mature guys... real mature.

nothing about personal hygiene.
- That's me... baby.

- No, no, look I...
Wait a minute, Ellie would never say that.
- Manny... Manny...
- No, no, they're not real... they're monsters.
They're Sirens, don't listen to them.
"Who can take the sunrise.... sprinkle it with dew"
No, they may look real but they're not,
they're going to destroy the ship.
- Come my tiger, swim with me.
- Sid.... I have a snack for you, uhuhbleh....
- And she cooks too.
- Sid... no!

- Um... because cruises are romantic.
- Whoo... five for seconds and we
would've been goners.

- She thinks she finally found her pet.
- Good girl...
- Here you go...
- Look Granny, can't you throw imaginary
food to your imaginary pet?
- Enough already...
We need to keep a lookout for home.
- Ignore them Precious... I do.
- Nah, can't take your eyes off her for one minute.
- Nope, it's like having a child...
...only without any of the joy.
- Hey brains trust... brace for impact.
- Huh...?
Guys... look, we're almost home.
- Buddy, I never doubted ya.
- Me either. Well... except for the six or
seven times I thought you were gonna die.
- What's wrong sweetheart?
- You ever say something you
knew you couldn't take back.
- Is this about Louis?
- I messed up so bad, mum.
- It's ok, it happens. Cute boys can
whiplash a brain... no doubt about that.
- But Ethan was the wrong guy.
- And you figured it out. You'll know what to say to Louis.

- You too Granny.
- Thanks lady.
- So, still want me on your scurvy crew?
- You bet, welcome to our herd.
- Hey you... I can't believe you
did that. Thankyou.
- Well, someone once told me that no matter what... you never leave a friend behind.
- All this sweetness is gonna rot my teeth...
if I had any.
- Our home is gone...
Where do we go now?
- Aww... Mumma loves you too...

but be back before sunset.
