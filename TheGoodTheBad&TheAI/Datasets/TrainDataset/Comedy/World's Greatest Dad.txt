Man's voice:
-

-
-
-
- COME ON, BOY, WE'RE LATE.
HEY, BUDDY, I--
OH, FUC--
WHAT THE FUCK?
- GOD! KYLE?

Radio:
YOU WERE UP EARLY.

WHAT A MONDAY.
WHY ARE WE
LISTENING TO THIS?
'CAUSE I LIKE
BRUCE HORNSBY.
STOP IT.
BRUCE HORNSBY IS A FAG.
HE'S GOT KIDS, KYLE.
-
- MMM.
-
- WHY? BECAUSE I LIKE BRUCE HORNSBY?
- YEAH. - WELL, PUT ON SOME
MUSIC YOU LIKE.OKAY?
NO, I FUCKING
HATE MUSIC.
- YOU HATE MUSIC?
- YEAH.
-
- YES.
THE ONLY THING QUEERER THAN
MUSIC ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT.
ALL MUSIC IS GAY NOW?
WHAT ABOUT HEAVY METAL?
THAT'S PROBABLY THE FAGGIEST
OF ALL THE FAG MUSIC OUT THERE.
KYLE, YOU COULD HAVE
DIED THIS MORNING.
WELL...
OF EMBARRASSMENT.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS DANGEROUS.
WHAT? BEATING OFF?
NO NO-- NOT--
WE ALL HAVE NEEDS, KYLE.
NEEDS? WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
MASTURBATION IS
NATURAL, OKAY?
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT NATURAL?
- WHAT?
TALKING ABOUT JERKING OFF WITH
YOUR DAD, THAT'S NOT NATURAL.
- SHIT.
- DON'T DO THAT, PLEASE, OKAY?
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOUR FEET ARE DIRTY.
BECAUSE I SAID SO.
- WHOA, LET ME OUT HERE.
- LET ME PARK IN THE LOT.
LANCE, I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE A DILLWEED
WALKING IN WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S BAD FOR MY REP.
DON'T CALL ME LANCE.
IT'S YOUR NAME,
ISN'T IT? LANCE?
SLOW DOWN, BOYS.
'MORNING.
DANNY.
- GOOD MORNING, LANCE.
- 'MORNING PRINCIPAL ANDERSON.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- OH, PERSONAL MAIL,
BUT I USED
MY OWN POSTAGE.
- MMM. GOOD.
- RIGHT.
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A MOMENT?
SURE.
YOUR POETRY COURSE,
IT'S NOT VERY POPULAR.
- NEITHER IS POETRY, SIR.
- MMM.
BUT THE FEW WHO TAKE IT,
THEY GET A LOT OUT OF IT.
YES YES,
I'M SURE THEY DO.
BUT I AM SORRY--
IF YOUR CLASS ENROLLMENT
DOESN'T IMPROVE BY NEXT SEMESTER,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DROP IT.
WE'RE ONLY BUDGETED FOR
ONE ENGLISH ELECTIVE,
AND MIKE LANE'S CREATIVE-WRITING
COURSE IS QUITE THE HIT.
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS UP.
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MR. L?
- HEY, HOW YOU DOIN', MAN?

- GOOD. - THROW A TOUCHDOWN FOR ME,
ALL RIGHT?
- OF COURSE!
- HEY, LANCELOT!
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
- NOT MUCH, MIKE.
ALL RIGHT.
'MORNING, MISS REED.
- HELLO, MR. CLAYTON.
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- MMM.
AHH, MY FAVORITE.
I THOUGHT TEACHERS WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAVORITES.
NOT FAVORITE STUDENTS.
I'M A LUCKY GUY.
HOW DOES A LUMP LIKE ME
GET A DAME LIKE YOU?
DON'T INSULT MY TASTE.
I'M THE LUCKY GUY.
YOU FINISHED?
YEAH. I WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST TO READ IT.
I'M HONORED.
REALLY?
MAYBE I'LL TAKE YOU
SOMEPLACE FANCY FOR DINNER.
HOW ABOUT YOU COME OVER TO MY
PLACE FOR SOMETHING HOT AND SPICY?
IS THAT A DOUBLE ENTENDRE?
- NO, I WAS JUST GOING TO
MAKE YOU MY CHILI. - OH.
AND THEN BANG YOU.
- GREAT!
-
YOU HAVE A VERY
PROFESSIONAL DAY, MISS REED.
RIGHT BACK AT YOU,
MR. CLAYTON.
- TAKE CARE.
- EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL DAY.
ANDREW, I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
WHAT IS IT?
EW, IS THAT WOMAN
BEING CRAPPED ON?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
IT'S FUCKING GERMAN SCHIZER PORN.
ALL RIGHT, DUDE?
IT'S FUCKING HOT, RIGHT, YO?
NO, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU, YO?
NOTHING.
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IF
YOU LIVED IN EUROPE.
I MEAN, THESE EUROPEANS ARE
MUCH MORE BROADMINDED THAN
THESE UPTIGHT AMERICANS.
SHIT'S HUGE IN GERMANY.
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT IN EUROPE
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF.
YEAH, I KNOW,
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE A FAG.
DUDE, IT'S GROSS.
I'D DO IT...
DO SOMEONE.
- OH.
- I WOULD.
I'D CHILI-DOG HER.
HI, JENNIFER.
COME ON, BABY, THAT PUSSY'S
NOT GONNA EAT ITSELF.
WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST SAY?
UH, NOTHING.
YOU'RE A FUCKING PIG.
WOW, OKAY.
HOLD THAT.
-
- GET OFF ME, YOU DUMB JOCK!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T EVEN PLAY SPORTS.
- YOU--
- HEY!
COME ON, GUYS,
KNOCK IT OFF. KNOCK IT OFF.
YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.
OH, YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME UP?
- COME ON.
- CAN'T YOU CONTROL THAT ANIMAL?
NOW COME ON, TOUGH GUY,
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO, GUYS.
COME ON.
Principal:
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO JENNIFER?
NOTHING.
HE SAID THAT HER PUSSY
IS NOT GOING TO EAT ITSELF.
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
YOU ARE--
THAT IS RUDE.
- AND YOU'RE A PERVERT.
- BE QUIET.
KYLE, IS THAT
WHAT YOU SAID?
NO.
JENNIFER, CHRIS,
GET BACK TO CLASS.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE
ON ACADEMIC PROBATION
AND YOUR GRADES SHOW NO
SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
EXPEL YOU.
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YES, MR. ANDERSON.
I DO UNDERSTAND.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
AND NO MORE TROUBLE.
WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.
LANCE,
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME.
HOW'S KYLE BEEN ACTING
AT HOME?
I MEAN, DOES HE SEEM
NORMAL TO YOU?
OH, YEAH.
OH.YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT SOMETIMES
THESE THINGS TAKE
A LONG TIME TO SURFACE.
WHAT THINGS?
WELL, I THINK THAT KYLE'S
POOR GRADES AND ACTING OUT
SHOW SIGNS OF A SERIOUS
DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM.
HE BELONGS IN
A SPECIAL-NEEDS SCHOOL
- WHAT?
- THAT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.
SIR, HE'S--
HE'S NOT SLOW.
HE'S JUST BEING A PAIN.
WELL, I HAVE.
I'VE GIVEN HIM MANY CHANCES.
THAT'S TRUE.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, BUT HE'D BETTER START
SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
AND QUICKLY. AND HE'S GOT TO STOP
DISTURBING THE OTHER STUDENTS.
THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE GROUNDED.
- I'LL RUN AWAY.
OH, AND LIVE
WITH YOUR MOTHER?
AND HER BOY-TOY TODD?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
- I'LL TAKE AWAY YOUR COMPUTER.
- NO, YOU WON'T.
YES, I WILL.
JESUS CHRIST, KYLE,
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?
I DIDN'T ASK TO
BE BORN.
NEITHER DID I.
BOO HOO.
Woman:
WAIT, READ FROM HERE.
STARTING THERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU READING?
- "WE DON'T EXPERIENCE IT
AS A RESTRICTION!"
- WHAT'S THAT?
- OH, GOD, YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

Woman: IT'S ABOUT THE FIRST
ROBOTTHAT JOINS THE N.B.A.

MIKE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE
IN "THE NEW YORKER."
- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
- HO HO!
RIGHT ON.
YOU DOG, YOU DOG!
- YEAH!
-
THIS SHOULD BE READ
AT ASSEMBLY.
NOW THAT IS
A GREAT IDEA.
MIKE, WOULD YOU READ IT
AT THE ASSEMBLY?
IF YOU TWIST MY ARM,
ALL RIGHT.
MAY I TAKE THIS
WITH ME?
- YEAH, SURE.
- CAN I READ IT AFTER HIM?
THAT'S AWESOME.
CONGRATULATIONS.
HEY, BLOW MY WHISTLE.
COME ON-- "THE NEW YORKER"!
FOR "THE NEW YORKER"!
YEAH!
WOW, I CANNOT WAIT
TO GET MY OWN COPY.
"NEW YORKER."
IT'S NOT A NATIONAL,

- NO.
ACTUALLY, IT IS
A NATIONAL MAGAZINE.
- IT'S NATIONAL.
- REALLY?
WHOA, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
MMM.
HOW'S KYLE?
GREAT.
RAISING A SON
IS SO HARD.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, MY HUNTER IS THE
BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
BUT MAN, CAN HE
BE A HANDFUL.
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- TWO, GOING ON 20.
OH, GOD.
THE KID'S A PLAYER.
WELL, I WONDER WHERE
HE GETS THAT FROM.
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
-
HOW'S HE DEALING WITH
THE SEPARATION?
REAL WELL.
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SEPARATED.
YEAH.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH,
BUT HIS MOTHER AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO MAKE A BABY TOGETHER.
WE JUST WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LIVE TOGETHER.
- THAT'S SO SAD.
- YEAH.
THANKS.
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU SEE HIM?
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.
THEY'RE NOT KIDDING WHEN
THEY SAY THAT RAISING A CHILD
IS THE TOUGHEST JOB
YOU'LL EVER LOVE.
MMM. WELL, YOU SOUND
LIKE A GREAT DAD.
AH, WELL,
I TRY MY BEST.

I CAN'T SEND HIM HOME,
DAD!
GOD, MAN, YOU NEVER
LISTEN TO ME.
I TOLD YOU,
HE DOESN'T HAVE A FATHER
AND HE HAS A MOTHER
WHO'S AN ALCOHOLIC.
KYLE, SEND HIM HOME.
YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER.
FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN SEND HIM HOME.
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
TO THIS GUY.
OKAY? YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.
- KYLE?
- YOU'RE SO-- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

YOU HAVE TO GO HOME.
WHY?
OH, WELL, THAT'S A QUESTION
FOR MY FATHER.
FINE, ANDREW CAN STAY.

IT'S JUST CHEESE.
I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT.

KYLE, LET'S SEE
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GOT HERE.

WELL, "FARMERS RELIED ON GOOD SOIL,
WORKER ANIMALS,
SUNSHINE AND...

UH, THAT'S--
THAT'S PRECIPITATION.

OH.
IT'S HOT. YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK, ANDREW?
NO.
YOU OKAY?
I'M TRYING TO WRITE.
- SORRY.
- PLEASE.
-
- HELLO?
- Lance:
- HI.
I'M COMING OVER TO YOUR HOUSE AND
PUTTING MY PENIS IN YOUR VAGINA.
THAT'S A SINGLE ENTENDRE.
OH, I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU EARLIER.
I DIDN'T GET TO THE STORE
SO I DIDN'T MAKE CHILI.
OH.WELL, I'LL
TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER.
OH, I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I MEAN, WE REALLY SHOULDN'T GO
OUT WHERE STUDENTS MIGHT SEE US.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL PICK UP
SOME TAKEOUT AND BRING IT OVER.
OH, WOULD YOU JUST HATE ME IF WE
DID THIS TOMORROW NIGHT INSTEAD?
I'M JUST NOT FEELING THAT GREAT,
AND IT'S ALREADY KIND OF LATE.
NO. NO, TOMORROW
NIGHT'LL BE GREAT.
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT MAD AT ME?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
THEN GOOD NIGHT, SUGAR.
LET'S SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING
ON THAT REPORT, HUH?

HAVE TO BE HOME, ANDREW?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S

WE CAN GO TO A VIDEO STORE,
GET A MOVIE.
ARE YOU STUPID?
I HATE WATCHING MOVIES.
YOU USED TO LIKE WATCHING
MOVIES WHEN YOU WERE A KID.
YEAH, ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU WANTED ME TO.
MOVIES ARE FOR LOSERS
AND ART FAGS.
OH.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?
UM...
CAN ANDREW AND I PLAY "DOOM"
ON MY COMPUTER?
YEAH.
JUST "DOOM,"
NOTHING ELSE.
I LIKE YOUR DAD.
MY DAD?
HE'S A FUCKING IDIOT.
Boy:
CAN'T WE GIVE OURSELVES
ONE MORE CHANCE?
WHY CAN'T WE GIVE LOVE
WHY CAN'T WE GIVE LOVE
GIVE LOVE
GIVE LOVE..."
JASON, YOU DIDN'T
WRITE THAT.
THAT'S A QUEEN/BOWIE SONG:
"UNDER PRESSURE."
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU KNEW THAT ONE.
JASON, I'M WHITE.
- OH, BOY.
- SIT DOWN.
THANK YOU.
GUYS, WHY ARE YOU HERE IF
YOU'RE NOT GONNA EVEN TRY?
POETRY IS ABOUT SAYING
SOMETHING FROM YOUR HEART,
SOMETHING PERSONAL.
OKAY?
YES, GINGER?
I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.
GREAT. GO AHEAD.
"IT WAS RAINING
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
WATER DRIPPING OFF THE LILAC
BUSHES MY MOTHER LOVES
AND AS I SAT AND WATCHED THE BLOOD
POUR OUT FROM BETWEEN MY LEGS
I WONDERED IF IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A BOY OR A GIRL"
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS VERY PERSONAL.
THANKS.
IF YOU EVER NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE, I'M HERE.
WHY?

Woman singing:
HELLO, LAMB CHOP.
HELLO, HONEYDEW MELON.
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU.
DO YOU LIKE MIKE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T GET MAD. I MEAN,
I KNOW WE'VE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT NOT SEEING
ANYONE ELSE.
I'M SORRY I SAID THAT.
I--
ARE WE STILL ON FOR DINNER?
- HELLO?
- Miss Reed:
I AM SO SORRY.
YEAH, YOU'RE
A REAL SHITBIRD.
DON'T LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN.
I AM SUCH A JERK.
AND IT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN AGAIN.
- HELLO?

OH, GREAT.
THANKS.
THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S AN INTERESTING PIECE.
- YEAH? YOU'RE AN INTERESTING PIECE.
- OH!
THIS IS JUST
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT?
AH. EXCEPT I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY GIRLFRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
OH, WELL, THOSE GIRLS
WERE IDIOTS.
I WOULD HAVE
BEEN YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
OH.
IF WE HAD A TIME MACHINE,
LET'S SEE--
MMM...
I'D BE IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND YOU'D BE A FETUS.
- I THINK THAT'S--
- NO, THAT'S NOT COOL.
NO, NOT COOL.
ALA LA LA LA.
Girl:
WE DID NOTHING,
FOLLOWED BY NOTHING,
WITH A GRAND FINALE
OF NOTHING.
ABOUT TIME, FELTER.
I THINK THEY'RE DOING IT.
WHAT?

ANDREW, ANDREW, LOOK,
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT FUCKING
PUSSY IS VIRGIN SHIT, ALL RIGHT?
WHEN I'M WITH A BITCH,
I JUST GO STRAIGHT FOR THE BROWN-EYE.

I GOT THAT PART, BUT
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN WITH A WOMAN.
FUCK YOU.
KYLE, I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU.

LOSER.
OH, YOU'RE FUCKING FUCKED!

OKAY.
HEY, LISTEN, I'M GOING

BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE
PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL.
CLAIRE.
CLAIRE?
DO I KNOW THIS CLAIRE?
MISS REED. HMM?
REALLY? YOU'RE GOING
OUT WITH THE T.I.L.F., THAT'S GREAT.

HEY, IT'S JUST WHAT THE OTHER
KIDS AT SCHOOL CALL HER.
WELL, SHE'S GOT A HOT BODY,
HELMET'S OKAY.
- DO HER FROM BEHIND.
- HEY, COME ON NOW!
KYLE, WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A PERVERT?
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOUR UNCLE PETE.
THERE'S MORE TO
A WOMAN THAN THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
HER PERSONALITY?
OH, UM, NAH.
SHE'S PRETTY STUCK UP
AND SHE'S A PHONY.
WHY DO I EVEN
TELL YOU THESE THINGS?
-
- HEY.
- HI.
- WE STILL ON FOR SOME VITTLES?
OH, I'M SO SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL YOU SOONER.
MY MOTHER IS HAVING
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
THEY WERE PLAYING FETCH OR
SOMETHING-- SHE'S FUCKING BANANAS.
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.
MMM, NOT AT ALL.
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT, CUPCAKES.
GOOD NIGHT,
WATERMELON SHERBET.

OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.
OH.
HOWEVER,
IF YOU WERE TO OFFER ME
SOME POT BROWNIES,
I WOULDN'T SAY NO.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
TONIGHT WHEN YOU'RE
GETTING CHANGED,
WOULD YOU MIND PULLING
YOUR BEDROOM DRAPES?
WHY?
I THINK MY SON WATCHES YOU.
GET OUT OF HERE.
NO NO. I THINK
HE WATCHES YOU CHANGE.
YOUR SON?
I THOUGHT HE
WAS A ZOMBIE.
I WISH.
I LIKE ZOMBIES.
OH, YEAH, YOU DO?
ME TOO. I DO.
- REALLY?
-
OH, I LIKE THE EARLY ZOMBIE MOVIES
LIKE "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD."
ME TOO.
- I DON'T LIKE THE NEW ONES.
- NO.
- ZOMBIES ARE TOO FAST, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH, TOO FAST. YEAH.
I BELIEVE LIKE SIMON PEGG SAID,
"THE DEATH IS AN IMPEDIMENT,
NOT AN ENERGY DRINK."
WHAT YOU DOING?
JESUS, DAD.
YOU ALMOST MADE ME CRAP.
DID YOU GET YOUR
HOMEWORK DONE?
YEAH, A LONG TIME AGO.
YEAH.
- YEAH.

NO.
SERIOUSLY, YOU SMELL LIKE POT.
ARE YOU SMOKING POT?

WHAT SMELL?
IT'S PROBABLY A SKUNK OUTSIDE
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.
OH YEAH, SURE,

BE PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING.
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I LIKE?
- YEAH.
- I LIKE LOOKING AT VAGINAS...
- AHH.
...ALL DAY LONG.
-
- YEAH.
BUT MAYBE DO SOMETHING
NON-VAGINA RELATED.
YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE
THE VAGINA.
OKAY, UH,
WE COULD GO TO THE MALL.
OKAY. AND THEN
WE'LL CATCH A MOVIE.
YEAH, SURE,
AT THE MALL, YOU KNOW?
AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE
LOOK FOR A NEW COMPUTER.
NO NO,
WE'LL JUST HANG.
DAD, DID I TELL YOU THAT
WE HAD TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER?
NO, I SAID-- IF YOU
WERE LISTENING TO ME--
THAT WE COULD LOOK
FOR A NEW COMPUTER, OKAY?
AND THEN WE'LL GO
TO YOUR MOVIE.
OKAY. BUT WE'RE NOT
BUYING A NEW COMPUTER.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS FUN.
THIS ISN'T
THE BIGGEST SCREEN.
JESUS CHRIST,
HOW ABOUT A "THANK YOU"?
ARE YOU ON YOUR PERIOD
OR SOMETHING?
HEY, ISN'T THAT-- ISN'T THAT
MIKE WITH MISS REED?
YEAH, IT IS.
DUDE, I WOULDN'T LET
MY BITCH TREAT ME THAT WAY.
- YOU DON'T HAVE A "BITCH."
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- HI, KYLE.
- HEY.
- MR. CLAYTON.
- HELLO, ANDREW.
OH, WOW, SO HE
GOT IT FOR YOU.
- SWEET. - NOT THAT SWEET.
IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST ONE.

THE MOVIES?
DAD, WE'LL GO

OKAY, FINE.
UH, WHAT ARE YOU

WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CRY?
FUCKING PUSSY.
GOD DAMN IT.
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S ME.
WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?
HE WAS DEPRESSED 'CAUSE
HE HAD TO GO TO THIS WEDDING,
SO I WENT WITH HIM TO THE MALL AND
HELPED HIM PICK UP A SUIT TO WEAR.
I KNOW,
I SAW YOU TWO THERE.
YOU DID?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMED WEIRD.
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT I HAVE MALE FRIENDS?
NO, IT BOTHERS ME YOU KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP SECRET
AND YOU'RE OUT
IN PUBLIC WITH HIM.
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT, HMM?
LET'S GO OUT.
WE'LL GO OUT SOMEPLACE FANCY,
SOMEPLACE THE WORLD
CAN SEE US.
HOW ABOUT
OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE?
OH.
ANYONE WHO'S ANYBODY
WILL BE THERE.
YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE
AUSSIETIZERS...
YOU KNOW, WAIT, I CAN'T.
I PROMISED KYLE I'D TAKE HIM OUT.
LET ME TAKE
BOTH OF YOU OUT.
- IT'LL BE MY TREAT.

OH.
THAT'S SO NICE.

WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TIP OVER THIS PHOTO?
I THINK YOU LOOK HANDSOME.
WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER
TONIGHT WITH CLAIRE.
WHAT? NO.
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
- OH, COME ON.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SEEING MR. LANE.
NO NO, THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS
AND SHE'S TRYING TO HELP HIM
OUT THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.
WHY AM I EXPLAINING
THIS TO YOU, KYLE?
DAD, OKAY, LOOK,
IT'S BAD ENOUGH BEING SEEING
WITH A TEACHER AS A DAD,
BUT BEING SEEN WITH
TWO TEACHERS IS AIDS.
OKAY, GET DRESSED.
PUT ON SOMETHING NICE.
IF YOU DON'T ACT RIGHT AT DINNER,
I'LL STAB YOU IN THE FACE.
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO, KYLE?
NOTHING.
NOTHING?
YOU MUST LIKE TO DO SOMETHING.
NO.
KYLE JUST GOT A NEW MONITOR
FOR HIS COMPUTER.
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO DO ON THE COMPUTER?
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY YOU ASK.
-
- GAMES, MOSTLY.
- KYLE, WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?
- ANDREW.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A BREAK
WHILE WE'RE EATING, SON?
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S IMPORTANT.
PUT IT AWAY.
SO, KYLE,
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS.
- OKAY.
- OOH.
WATCH OUT.
ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IT?
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.
NON-STOP.
I'M HURTING RIGHT NOW.
LET'S NOT MAKE ME
THROW UP.
SO DO YOU PLAY SPORTS?
NO NO. I'M A BIG SPAZ LIKE MY DAD.
WELL, I WAS ON THE DIVE TEAM
IN COLLEGE.
DIVING IS NOT REALLY
A SPORT, IT'S FALLING.
I'M SORRY.
HEY, WHY DON'T WE RENT
A MOVIE AFTER DINNER?
SURE, AS LONG AS
IT'S NOT HORROR.
- REALLY?
- I DO NOT LIKE HORROR.
ZOMBIES? ARE YOU
OKAY WITH ZOMBIES?
- NO.
- OH.
DO YOU LIKE MUSICALS?
I LOVE MUSICALS.
BOB FOSSE WAS A GREAT
DIRECTOR.
HE DID "SWEET CHARITY"
AND "ALL THAT JAZZ."
- "CABARET." - ONE OF THE GREAT
NAZI MUSICALS OF ALL TIME.
BESIDES "THE SOUND
OF MUSIC," YOU KNOW?
THEN HE DID "STAR 80."
THAT WAS NOT A MUSICAL, BUT...
- I ONLY LIKE THE MUSICALS.
- OH, WELL.
- ME TOO.
- "WILLY WONKA."
WHICH ONE?
- Lance:
-
- I LIKE JOHNNY DEPP.
- OH.
- YEAH.
- MM-HM.
- BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE GENE WILDER... -
- ...IN "YOUNG...
- Both: FRANKENSTEIN."
DID YOU SEE IT?
- NO.
- OH, YOU SHOULD.
- IT'S AMAZING.
- REALLY WONDERFUL.
YEAH.
EVERYBODY'S SEEN IT.
- I'M SURE.
-
- NIGHT, MISS REED.
- GOOD NIGHT, KYLE.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HIT THAT SHIT TONIGHT?
- SHUT UP! - COME ON, DUDE.
THAT SHIT'S TIGHT, DUDE.
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU
DON'T NAIL HER--
HEY HEY,
IF YOU DON'T NAIL HER, DUDE, YOU'RE--
- YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.
- WILL YOU STOP IT?
-
-
-  - I JUST WANNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT TO HER ALONE.
- OKAY?
- WITH YOUR COCK.
KYLE,
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.
WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT THE FUCK UP?
JESUS, MAN. YOU FUCKING NEED
TO GET LAID. GO OVER THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ALL RIGHT. DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO, OKAY?
SHORT OF KILLING HER,
THAT LEAVES ME A LOT OF ROOM.
HEY, BABY.
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
KYLE.
NIGHT, WHORE.
HEY.
- THAT WAS FUN.
- THE KISS?
- MM-HMM.
- I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING, COME ON.
- NOT TONIGHT.
- WOW.
ARE YOU SHOOTING
ME DOWN?
LISTEN, I'D LOVE TO STAY,
BUT I PROMISED KYLE I'D BE RIGHT BACK.
KYLE DOESN'T LIKE ME.
OH NO.
HE LIKES YOU A LOT.
- NO.
- MM-HMM.
HE TOLD ME THAT
WHEN I DROPPED HIM OFF.
- HE DID?
- YEAH.
HE SAID I WAS
A LUCKY GUY.
NO, I'M THE LUCKY GUY.
I GOTTA GO.
OH, COME ON.
HE'S ALMOST AN ADULT.
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.
WHOA.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE
HOME WITH THAT BONER, HUH?
I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A STICK-SHIFT
JOKE THERE SOMEWHERE
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT 'CAUSE ALL
THE BLOOD'S LEAVING MY BRAIN.
- SLEEP WELL.
- HEY.
OH, THAT'S SWEET.
MMM.
-
- OH.BOO.
- YOU'RE MEAN.
- GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PEA.
GOOD NIGHT,
CREAM CHEESE.
YOU KNOW I--
OH!
- HMM?
-
YOU SURE?
I'M BACK.
KYLE.
HEY, KYLE.
OH, KYLE.
I TOLD YOU TO STOP DOING THAT.
KYLE?
WELCOME BACK, LANCE.
HI.
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.
IF YOU NEED MORE TIME OFF,
TAKE IT.
NOBODY HERE WOULD
FAULT YOU FOR THAT.
NO, I'M OKAY.
THANKS.
GINGER.
HEY, MIKE.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU BACK, LANCELOT.
THANKS.
MR. CLAYTON.
ANDREW.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
OKAY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
THANKS.
AND I'M SORRY
ABOUT MY MOM.
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE SHE THREW UP IN YOUR PLANTER
AT THAT THING AT YOUR
HOUSE AFTER THE FUNERAL.
I WONDERED
WHO DID THAT.
SHE DRINKS TOO MUCH.
I KNOW.
DON'T WORRY, ANDREW.
IT MEANT A LOT TO ME
THAT YOU CAME.
THANKS, MR. CLAYTON.
MR. CLAYTON.
SOMETHING DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME.
WHAT, ANDREW?
DID KYLE SEEMED
THAT BUMMED OUT TO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
TO DO WHAT HE DID.
HE JUST--
IT'S JUST, HE DIDN'T
SEEM THAT SAD.
ANDREW, KYLE WAS
A COMPLEX GUY.
YEAH,
I'LL SAY.
HEY.
HEY.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M OKAY.
GOOD.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE THAT I HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE MORE FOR YOU.
IT'S JUST THAT
I DON'T DO DEATH WELL.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW, I--
I'VE BEEN KIND OF A ZOMBIE
LATELY ANYWAY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.
I'M NOT.
LET'S DO SOMETHING SOON,
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
CHEER UP, PUMPKIN.
I LIKE YOU.
THANKS.
Anderson: HARDLY ANYONE
CAMETO THE FUNERAL.
I FELT BAD.
I SHOULD HAVE GONE.
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
IT WAS A WEEKDAY.
LANCE,
- MR. PENTOLA.
- DR. PENTOLA.
NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. CLAYTON.
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
THANK YOU.
DR. PENTOLA
IS A THERAPIST.
WE CALLED HIM IN
BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID
KYLE'S DEATH MAY
TRIGGER OTHER SUICIDES.
HE'S A GRIEF COUNSELOR.
OH.
I'VE READ A LOT OF
SUICIDE NOTES,
AND THIS ONE SEEMED...
REALLY?
AND I WANT YOU TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.
OF COURSE.
DID KYLE HAVE ANY FRIENDS?
EXCUSE ME?
WELL, IT'S JUST
NO ONE'S COME TO SEE ME.
YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW KYLE.
WELL, I SHOULDN'T SAY
NO ONE.
A COUPLE OF KIDS CAME IN WITH
AGE- APPROPRIATE DEPRESSION,
EATING DISORDERS.
ONE KID CAME IN
WITH HEAD LICE.
I KNOW HIM.
NOT REALLY MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.
BUT NO ONE'S COME TO TALK
ABOUT KYLE.
HMM.
- OH.
- WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS?
- ANDREW TROUTMEN.
- AND WHO ELSE?
THAT'S IT.
KYLE WAS KIND
OF A LONER.
A LONE WOLF.
UH, I'LL HAVE TO
ASK ANDREW
TO COME AND SEE ME.
AND, LANCE, THAT GOES
FOR YOU TOO.
IF YOU NEED TO TALK, IF YOU WANNA
GET ANYTHING OFF YOUR CHEST,
OF COURSE, DOC,
I WILL.
THANK YOU, LANCE.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WHO WANTS TO READ NEXT?
- RIGHT HERE!
- ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S GONNA
GIVE ME $20?
- All: OH.
- OH, COME ON NOW.
-
- Mike:
JASON.
GO AHEAD.
"NEGRO?
I MAY BE YOUNG
BUT I'M NOT YOUR BOY
YEAH, I SING,
I DANCE
BUT I DO IT WITH THE DIGNITY
OF MY ANCESTORS
I AM NOT YOUR MONKEY"
RIGHT ON.
STAY BLACK, Y'ALL.
ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE THEIR HAIKU?
- Claire:
- HEY, SWEET TARTS.
-
- HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M WATCHING MIKE PLAY BASKETBALL.
OH.
- YOU OKAY?
- OH, YEAH.
-
- OH, YEAH.
-
- WHAT?
I GOTTA GO.
MIKE JUST WON THE BASKETBALL GAME.
YEAH, MIKE!
-
- HI.
I MADE YOU SOMETHING.
WHAT?
- THOSE BROWNIES.
- OH.
- OH.
- YEAH.
WELL, I'LL COME OVER
AND HAVE SOME.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE I COULD COME
IN AND WE'D EAT THEM TOGETHER.
NO, I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?
- I'M BUSY.
BONNIE, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
IN MY APARTMENT.
MY APARTMENT IS A LITTLE
SAD RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?
IF I-- IF I LET YOU IN,
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.
-
- OKAY.
SO...
- BROWNIES, HUH?
- YEAH.
- COME IN.
- AH.
PLEASE, DON'T TELL
ANYBODY, OKAY?
BECAUSE I-- I DON'T WANNA
GET THROWN OUT OF HERE.
- OH, I PROMISE.
- THANKS.
I-I KNOW
IT'S A FIRE HAZARD
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
RATIONAL, BUT...
I FEEL THAT IF I
THROW ANYTHING OUT,
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WILL HAPPEN.
- NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- GOOD.
WHAT'S WRONG, SWEETIE?
I KNOW MY SON WAS
A JERK, BUT I MISS HIM.
HEY.
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
- MMM.
IT'LL GET BETTER.
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT
RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU KNOW THAT
I HAVE READ EVERY ONE
OF YOUR BOOKS?
HOW?
HOW?
YOU THREW 'EM OUT.
OH, YEAH.
YOU ARE VERY TALENTED.
REALLY?
HONEST.
YOU HAVE A GIFT.
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.
I WON'T.
LISTEN,
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A ZOMBIE
MARATHON ON TELEVISION
AND I CORDIALLY
INVITE YOU, SIR.
OH, WELL, BLESS YOU,
MADAM.
- UH-HUH.
- IT'S A DATE.
GOOD.
DON'T FORGET THE BROWNIES.
- I WON'T FORGET.
- NO.
YOUR DOG'S STARING
AT ME.
WHAT DOG?
I GOT YA.
- LANCE!
- OH.
- I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
- WHAT'S UP?
YOU KNOW THAT WHILE WE
RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY,
WE ALSO RESPECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND EXPRESSION HERE AT SCHOOL?
- YEAH.
- WELL, ONE OF THE KIDS ON THE PAPER
WENT ONLINE AND THEY FOUND
KYLE'S POLICE REPORT--
THE REPORT OF HIS DEATH.
AND NOW THEY'VE GONE AND
PUBLISHED HIS SUICIDE NOTE.
- OH MY GOD.
- YEAH.I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
IT'S ALL OVER CAMPUS.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
YOU-- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
SURE.
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, LANCE.
IT'S THAT GODDAMN
FIRST AMENDMENT, HUH?
YEAH.
Lance's voice:
Lance's voice:
Lance and Kyle's voices:
Kyle's voice:
I LOVE YOU, DAD.
HAS ANYONE SEEN
CARL OR STEVEN?
MM-HMM.
OH, YOU HAVE?
SO THEY'RE IN SCHOOL?
YEAH, I SAW 'EM
THIS MORNING.
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE,
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
WITH WRITING POETRY?
- YES, HEATHER.
- CAN I ASK A QUESTION?
SURE.
WHAT WAS KYLE'S
FAVORITE BAND?
UH...
HE LIKED
BRUCE HORNSBY.
DID HE LISTEN
TO ANY METAL?
- A LITTLE OZZY.
- I KNEW IT.
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT POETRY OR...
DID THE BOY KNOW JESUS
BEFORE HE WENT?
WELL, I WOULD SAY
HE WAS AN AGNOSTIC.
BUT I THINK HE WAS
SPIRITUAL IN HIS OWN WAY.
YEAH-- YES, HEATHER?
WHAT'S HIS SIGN?
OH, HE WAS BORN
APRIL 18TH, SO--
ARIES.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW, ANYBODY KNOW
EZRA POUND?
YOU KNOW
WHAT KYLE REALLY LIKED?
EMILY DICKINSON.
WHAT BAND IS THAT?
IT WASN'T A BAND.
SHE WAS A POET.
- SHE HOT?
-
IF YOU LIKE YOUR BUTTONED-DOWN GIRL,
SHE WAS ONE OF 'EM.
- NICE.
-
-
-
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?
-
IT'S ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE.
IT-- IT AFFECTED ME
A LOT.
WELL, IT SEEMED TO AFFECT
A LOT OF STUDENTS.
- I'M NOT HAPPY, MR. CLAYTON. - MM-HMM.
I'M LIVING A LIE.
I'M GAY.
AND KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE,
IT'S HELPED ME GET THE
COURAGE TO COME OUT FINALLY.
WELL, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
I'M MISUNDERSTOOD TOO,
JUST LIKE HE WAS.
I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY.
GOOD FOR YOU, PETER.
I-I WISH YOU THE BEST.
THANK YOU.
HEY, MR. CLAYTON.
- MR. CLAYTON.
- GINGER.
KYLE WAS RIGHT.
EMILY DICKINSON'S GREAT.
ISN'T SHE?
- MR. CLAYTON?
- YES.
- I WROTE ANOTHER POEM.
- CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT, HEATHER.
- JOHN.DOCTOR.
- HEY.
CLAIRE.
MR. C., WHAT'S UP?
"MILKY WHITE SKIN
AND HAIR SO BROWN
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
HOW BAD YOU HURT
I COULD HAVE HELD YOU
WHILE YOU CRIED
YOU WERE TOO SWEET
TO STAY
IN THIS HARSH WORLD
BUT I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU CLOSE TO MY HEART
- MY ANGEL IN CARGO PANTS"
- Boy:
HE WAS SUCH
A SWEET KID.
AND KIND.
OH, PLEASE.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
AS A FATHER,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF
HUNTER DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
MY HEART REALLY GOES
OUT TO YOU, LANCE.
THANKS.
IT'S SO SAD. I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS SUCH A GOOD WRITER.
YEAH, HE DID.
I KNOW IT'S REALLY PERSONAL,
BUT DO YOU THINK I COULD READ IT?
WELL, IF YOU CAME OVER
TO MY APARTMENT.
I JUST DON'T WANT HIS STUFF OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW, FLOATING AROUND.
SURE.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?
GREAT.
MY PLAYOFF GAME'S
TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
NOT THE LIP.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TAKE THE LIP.
OH, THANKS, MIKE.
WHAT TIME?
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE TIME BECAUSE
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T CLEANED.
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
- WELL, 8:00?
- THAT'S GREAT.
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.
THANKS.
IF YOU THINK THIS
IS A BAD IDEA--
NO NO NO.
NOT AT ALL.
I FOUND SOMETHING
KYLE WROTE
AND I REALLY THINK
YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.
OKAY.
THIS IS FROM HIS JOURNAL.
"I WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH
MY DAD AND CLAIRE TONIGHT.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
SEEING THEM TOGETHER
ONLY PROVES THAT I'LL
NEVER BE HAPPY.
I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND
A WOMAN LIKE HER--
SHE SEEMS TO COMPLETE HIM.
I HOPE THEY MAKE IT.
I HOPE THEY LAST.
I HOPE I'M LEAVING
MY DAD IN GOOD HANDS.
NO ONE COULD EVER GET ME.
I DON'T EVEN GET ME."
OH.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
COULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.
HE DID LIKE ME.
HE REALLY DID.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
NO.
I'D NEVER DO THAT.
-
- REALLY.
MR. CLAYTON.
- GOOD MORNING, HEATHER.
- YES.
GOOD MORNING.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
OF KYLE'S?
WHAT?
THAT I COULD HAVE?
- NO.
- OH.
WAIT A SECOND.
HERE YOU GO.
BRUCE HORNSBY?
THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE.
THANK YOU.
I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
YEAH, I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT TOO.
- YEAH.
-
I'M TIRED OF HIDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.
MMM.
- DAN.
- LANCE.
- GINGER.
- MR. CLAYTON, LOOK AT THIS.
OH.
HEATHER.
HEY, MR. C.
OH, PETER.
- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.
- OH.
I DON'T KNOW IF KYLE
EVER TOLD YOU,
BUT HE AND I WERE
KINDA BROS.
I'M GONNA WIN THIS GAME
TONIGHT IN HIS HONOR.
GREAT, PETER.
Andrew:
ANDREW.
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,
DOES IT?
WHAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT?
HOW EVERYONE IS ACTING.
NO, IT DOESN'T.
- WHAT?
- KYLE'S SUICIDE NOTE.
IN WHAT WAY?
THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING
AN INSIGNIFICANT MOLECULE
BOUNCING AROUND IN A
MEANINGLESS GODLESS UNIVERSE.
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,
BUT KYLE WAS...
WHAT?
KINDA DUMB.
HA.NO.
KYLE WAS ACTUALLY
SMART, ANDREW.
YOU KNOW, HE JUST PRETENDED
TO BE DUMB, EVEN AROUND YOU
SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WOULDN'T PICK ON HIM.
YEAH, MAYBE.
- Heather:
- Ginger:
HEY!
OH! GET OFF!
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LIKE KYLE!
YOU DIDN'T LIKE KYLE!
SHUT UP, WHORE!
BRUCE HORNSBY?
Lance:
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
SUICIDE LEAVES
MANY VICTIMS.
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.
KYLE MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING
FROM A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.
AND I KNOW THAT THE NOTE
BEING PUBLISHED
HAS CAUSED YOU SOME
DISTRESS,
BUT IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN
A VERY POSITIVE THING.
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OF THESE KIDS
I CAN HELP BECAUSE THEY'RE
REACHING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME?
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE PART WHERE KYLE WRITES:
"I LOVE YOU, DAD."
BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T
REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?
BUT HE DID.
LANCE, SUICIDE
IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION
TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.
AND WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY KIDS WE WON'T LOSE
BECAUSE OF THAT NOTE?
Lance:
LANCE, YOU DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD.
WELL, I HAD KIND OF
A ROUGH WEEKEND.
I DID A LOT OF SOUL
SEARCHING
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID ABOUT KYLE'S NOTE
AND THE EFFECT
ON THE OTHER KIDS,
AND...
THIS IS KYLE'S JOURNAL.
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU
TO READ.
I WANT YOU TO READ IT, AND IF YOU THINK
IT'LL BE OF VALUE TO THE OTHER KIDS,
I WANNA PUBLISH IT
AND HAND IT OUT TO THEM.
- I'LL SEE IF I CAN'T GIVE IT A LOOK.
- OH, THANKS.
Lance:
WELL?
IT'S SO SAD.
YEAH.
I MEAN, KYLE WAS SUCH
A STRONG POWERFUL WRITER.
SO TORTURED.
YES, HE WAS.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA CALL IT?
I WAS THINKING
"I AM WHAT I HATE."
WHAT?
"I AM WHAT I HATE."
KYLE WROTE THAT IN CHAPTER SIX.
OH.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
I DON'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.
WHY?
- TO ME, A BETTER TITLE...
- MM-HMM.
...WOULD BE
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."
- OH.
- YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.
BUT HE DIDN'T WRITE
THAT THOUGH, I MEAN...
YEAH, BUT
HE FELT THAT.
- YOU'RE INFERRING THAT FROM HIM.
-
OH.
"I AM WHAT I HATE" DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE AS A TITLE.
GIVE ME A KISS.
AW.
- COME HERE.
- OH.
EVERYBODY LOVES THE BOOK.
YES, THEY DO.
- YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
- YEAH.YEAH.
FUCK ME.
- I AM.
- HARDER.
NO NO NO.
FROM BEHIND.
OKAY.OKAY.
- LIKE THAT?
-
-
- TO THE LEFT.
TO THE LEFT.
MY LEFT.MY LEFT.
OKAY.
YEAH!
YEAH.
DON'T STOP.
DON'T STOP.
DON'T STOP!
- STOP! STOP.STOP.
-
-
-
-
-
ARE YOU READY FOR
OUR UNDEAD MARATHON?
Lance:
-
- OH.NO, IT'S OKAY.
-
- OH YEAH, DEAR.GOOD.
YEAH, LISTEN I--
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
- OKAY.SEE YOU.
- SORRY.BYE.
Mike:
YEAH, GREAT.
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.
YOU KNOW WHAT LINE
REALLY BLEW ME AWAY,
IS WHEN KYLE WROTE:
"AMERICA IS ONE OF THE FINEST
COUNTRIES ANYONE EVER STOLE."
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.
HE REMINDS ME
OF MY HUNTER.
LANCE, I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I LURED YOU OUT HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOU
IF WE RENAMED THE LIBRARY
THE KYLE CLAYTON
MEMORIAL LIBRARY?
BUT YOU WERE GONNA PUT HIM
IN A SPECIAL-NEEDS CLASS.
YEAH.
YEAH, AND I FEEL
REALLY BAD ABOUT THAT.
- OH.
- HE WASN'T SLOW.
OBVIOUSLY
HE WAS BRILLIANT.
HE WAS JUST BORED.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD HIM
TOTALLY WRONG.
I JUST HOPE TO GOD THAT OUR MISTAKE
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH--
WELL, WITH
WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT DIDN'T.
THANKS, LANCE.
SURE, SIR.
WYATT.
THANKS, LANCE.
THANKS.
OH!
JUST LIKE MY PROM NIGHT,
NOTHING WENT IN THE HOLE.
NO, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GONNA BE A TASTEFUL DEDICATION.
VERY TASTEFUL.
-
-
HELLO?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- WOW.
- WHAT?
PENTOLA-- HE SENT
KYLE'S JOURNAL TO DR. DANA.
SHE LOVES IT. SHE WANTS ME
TO BE ON THE SHOW.
SHE'S GONNA FLY ME
TO L.A.
- WHAT'S DR. DANA?
- SHE'S LIKE OPRAH.
WELL, SHE'S NOT
AS BIG AS OPRAH.
I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD SHOW,
YOU KNOW?
WOMEN SEEM TO
REALLY LIKE IT.
- ANDREW.
-
OH, NO NO.
JUST PACKING FOR MY TRIP.
YEAH, THAT TV SHOW.
"DR. DANA."
WHAT'S UP?
I FEEL BAD.
I WISH I KNEW
HE WAS THAT DEPRESSED.
YOU AND ME BOTH.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE
ABOUT THE BOOK?
WHAT?
KYLE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT VAGINAS, ANAL SEX,
FISTING, FELCHING
OR RIM JOBS.
IT IS A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE
FELCHING AREA, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT I THINK IT'S THERE,
ANDREW, IN ITS OWN WAY.
I WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
THE BOOK IS SO SMART AND SAD.
HE NEVER TALKED
WITH ME LIKE THAT.
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF,
ANDREW.
ONE THING I KNOW,
HE LIKED YOU.
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
TALK TO ME?
MAYBE IT'S LIKE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
HE WAS SUPER SMART.
HE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
OF BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY.
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE WAS ALREADY TREATED LIKE A FREAK.
IF HE WAS THAT SMART HE WOULD
HAVE LOVED TO RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT.
OH, JESUS CHRIST, ANDREW.
WHY CAN'T YOU LET IT GO, OKAY?
NO WONDER
YOUR MOTHER DRINKS.
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LAST
THINGS KYLE SAID TO ME?
HE SAID THAT YOU'RE
A STUPID FUCKING IDIOT.
KYLE'S STILL DEAD.
ANDREW.
ARE YOU ALMOST READY?
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.
Claire: I THINK YOU SHOULD
KEEPYOUR PANTS ON.
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR PANTS ON.
OH.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.
MMM.
THANKS.
I'M USING BACKWARD
PSYCHOLOGY.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
I HAVE TO PEE AGAIN.
- HELLO.
- MR. CLAYTON,
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE
BUT THE SHOW CALLED AGAIN
- AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE LEAVING.
- OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BABY, THAT WAS THE DRIVER.
HE SAID THE SHOW CALLED.
WE GOTTA GET GOING,
OKAY?
-  - OH, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
LET'S GET GOING, COME ON.
- DOES THIS MAKE MY ASS LOOK BIG?
- NO NO. NOT AT ALL.
- YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR ASS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I MEAN--
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T HAVE AN ASS?
I'M SAYING YOUR ASS IS THERE,
BUT IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.
- I'M CHANGING AGAIN.
- NO.
YOU KNOW,
SWEETHEART,
I REALLY SHOULD GET OVER THERE SO
I COULD SIT DOWN WITH THE PRODUCER
AND GO OVER WITH WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY.
THAT WOULD
REALLY HELP ME A LOT.
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- FABULOUS.
- I REALLY--
- NOPE.
I LIKE THAT DRESS.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ON THE WAY,
THEY THROW UP IN MY CAR.
- YEAH?
- YEAH.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
- YOU LOOK PRETTY.
- THANK YOU.YOU'RE SO SWEET.
THANKS.
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS ON THE SHOW?
- I AM.
- OH.
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
- THANKS.

PHOTOS OF KYLE. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

UP THE BACK OF THE BOOK?
THAT'S A DIRECTOR QUESTION.
I'M A SEGMENT PRODUCER.
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHEN THE CAMERA IS ON ME?
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE
FRIENDS- AND-FAMILY SECTION.

- COULD YOU GRAB A SEAT?
OKAY, YEAH.

I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF
ISSUES TO DISCUSS WITH LANCE.

- DON'T TUCK YOUR CHIN.
- OH.
AND ABOVE ALL,
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
LANCE, HI.
- LOOK THIS WAY, PLEASE.
- I DON'T MEAN TO BUG YOU RIGHT NOW.
MY NAME IS BERT GREEN.
I'M WITH WITH McKENNA ARTIST.
- HI, BERT.
- YOUR SON'S MEMOIR IS SO STRONG.
MY GOD, IT'S SO MOVING.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU.
MM-HMM.
- OH, THANK YOU. - HAVE YOU
BEEN TALKING TO PUBLISHERS?
- NO. - BECAUSE I HONESTLY
THINK THIS COULD BE
THE BIGGEST POSTHUMOUS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY
SINCE "THE DIARY
OF ANNE FRANK," HONESTLY.
- REALLY?
- OH MY GOD.
YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR...
YES.
YEAH, THAT'S HUGE.
LOOK, I'M GONNA GET OUT
OF YOUR HAIR RIGHT NOW.
BUT IF ANY OF THIS
INTERESTS YOU,
- GIVE ME A CALL, OKAY?
- OKAY.
JUST GIVE ME A RING.
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.
GREAT TO MEET YOU.
GO OUT THERE AND KILL 'EM.
- DO IT.
- OKAY.

- OH, GREAT.
- IT'S GO TIME, ALL RIGHT?
- OKAY.
SO AGAIN, LANCE,
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
AND LET'S HAVE
A GREAT SHOW.
MY GUEST TODAY
IS MR. LANCE CLAYTON.
LANCE'S 15-YEAR-OLD SON KYLE
TRAGICALLY TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.
BUT FROM THIS TERRIBLE
STORY OF LOSS
AROSE ONE OF HOPE.
HERE HE IS TO SHARE THIS POWERFUL
STORY, MR. LANCE CLAYTON.
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US.

IS FOR A PARENT TO LOSE A CHILD.
YES.YES IT IS.
TELL US ABOUT
YOUR SON KYLE.
IT'S DIFFICULT,
ISN'T IT?

A LOT BREWING UNDERNEATH?

FOR YOU.
INDEED.
"YOU DON'T KNOW ME."
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFULLY
WRITTEN.

HE WAS A GREAT WRITER.
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
THAT REALLY MOVES ME.

"IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO BE A GOOD PERSON

HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS
WRITTEN BY A 15-YEAR-OLD.

YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
THAT I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE MIND
OF A TEENAGER.
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
KYLE MADE A MISTAKE.
IF YOU'RE THAT DEPRESSED,
REACH OUT TO SOMEONE.
AND REMEMBER, SUICIDE

TO TEMPORARY PROBLEMS.

THIS SONG TO MY BIGGEST FAN,
- KYLE CLAYTON.

* HIDING OUT
FROM THE RAIN *
* UNDER THE CARNIVAL TENT
* I LAUGHED
AND SHE'D SMILE *
* IT WOULD LAST
FOR A WHILE *
* YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GOT *
* A SAD SONG
DRIFTING LOW *
* LISTEN TO
THE TEARS ROLL *
MR. CLAYTON,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I'VE ALWAYS FELT
NOT ENOUGH.
MY DAD
RIDES ME
ALL THE TIME.
HE CALLS ME A LOSER.
I ALMOST KILLED MYSELF
UNTIL KYLE'S NOTE
AND BOOK CAME OUT.
IT SAVED MY LIFE.
I KNOW HE'S LOOKING
DOWN ON YOU SO PROUD.
THANKS, PETE.
THANK YOU,
BRUCE HORNSBY.
TODAY
WE CELEBRATE KYLE.
KYLE HAS SHOWN US
SO MANY THINGS;
HOW FLEETING THE TIME
WE SPEND ON THIS EARTH
REALLY IS.
TODAY WE DEDICATE
THIS LIBRARY
IN HIS SPIRIT.
A TRIBUTE TO HIS DEEP
INTELLIGENCE
AND NOW TO ACCEPT
THIS HONOR ON HIS BEHALF,
I GIVE YOU HIS FATHER
YOU GUYS
DIDN'T LIKE KYLE.
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
I DIDN'T EITHER.
I LOVED HIM.
HE WAS MY SON,
BUT HE WAS ALSO
A DOUCHE BAG.
HE WASN'T VERY SMART
AND HE DIDN'T KILL
HIMSELF.
KYLE DIED ACCIDENTALLY
WHILE MASTURBATING.
AND I WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE.
I ALSO WROTE HIS JOURNAL.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.
YEAH.
Lance's voice:
I KNEW YOU
WROTE THE BOOK.
I LIKED IT.
- REALLY?
-
I THINK
YOU SHOULD KEEP WRITING.
THANKS, ANDREW.
I WILL.
HEY, ANDREW.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING.
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO EAT?
I'D LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH, SIR.
I'M VEGETARIAN.
I KNOW.
