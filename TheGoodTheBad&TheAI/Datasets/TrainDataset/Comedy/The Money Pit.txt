Walter.
I do.
Florinda.
I do.
-
-
You've made me
very happy, my dear.
I am happy too.
I wish only that your son
would have come to our wedding.
-My son has problems.
-How can he have problems
with a father like you?
He has problems
because he has a father like me.
-
-
P.S. Give my best to the Cheap Girls.
They were my favourite.
Very pretty, your new mom.
We used to be a respectable
law firm. Now look at him.
-Looks happy to me.
-He steals the money, I get the bills.
Dad, why did you
do this to me?
-Well, I can see why.
-
##
-
-
That's all I ever wanted to be,
just conventional.
A little house in the suburbs,
a white picket fence...
maybe a dog,
and just to round it out...
a wife.
Will you marry me?
Walter...
my darling...
But why do we need a piece of paper
from the state of New York?
One bad experience, that's all.
You just had one bad experience.
Just give me
a little more time.
Okay.
But I can't live
this life of shame much longer.
You're gonna have to make
an honest man of me.
-I like the kissing part.
-
-
-
-Did you hear that?
-What?
Somebody just came in
our front door.
-Be careful, Walter.
-
-Oh, my God! You're still here?
-
Boat has docked.
He's here, you're out.
Who the hell
are you?
Maestro is back!
I thought he wasn't coming back
until next week.
You know Maestro.
He surprise you.
What are you talking about?
Who is this guy?
-I thought I had a year.
-You did, but year has come and gone.
What you do?
You stayed in bed all the time?
Didn't look for apartment?
I... did.
There are no apartments.
Yeah, right.
Who are we talking about?
Who is this guy? Who are you?
I'm talking to him,
he won't answer me.
-When is he coming here?
-
But he will come.
It's him you're talking about,
isn't it? The lunatic is back.
Yes!
I thought he was in Europe.
Oh. All right.
I'm sorry.
Look, guys,
why don't I talk to him.
Maybe we can
live here all together.
Wait. Wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're not lookin' at
a charity case here.
If this is his apartment,
we'll get out. It's no problem.
Could you just give us
a few minutes alone?
Sure, I understand.
Have a nice day.
What are we gonna do?
This is New York City. It takes months
to find a place, even if you're rich.
And we're broke!
We're doomed, homeless, penniless.
-Doomed.
-I'm sorry, Walter.
No, no, no. It's not your fault.
We both knew he was coming back.
It's just that we've
been so happy lately.
Jack can help us.
Isn't Jack in jail?
No. No, he got off
with a small fine.
-Jack's a perfectly legitimate
real estate agent.
-
Well, as long
as we're together.
-Nothing bad can happen.
-Mmm.
-
-Oh, here's a beautiful place.
It's only an eight-hour commute
to New York City.
You don't get in more
than once a week, do you?
SoHo, 350 a month. Let's see,
Eisenhower was president, right?
-
-
Listen, Walter,
I gotta take a call.
Meet me at
the jogging track at 1:00.
You won't recognize me.
I'm so thin!
Martha, in this country
we have an expression for almost late.
It's called "on time."
-You don't seem nervous.
-I'm not.
She's not nervous. I'm nervous.
You're hysterical.
How is Walter
taking it?
Taking what?
There's nothing to take.
Here he comes!
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's a great pleasure
to be back with you again.
-I'm sure you feel the same.
-
When I left, you were
the finest orchestra in the world.
God knows what a season under
the heavy hand of my esteemed
colleague has wrought.
Let us assess the damage...
with the Haydn,
from the beginning.
##
# Bring me higher
and higher #
# Give me lovin' #
-Jimmy!
-
-##
-Jimmy!
Big guy! Big "W."
What's shakin'?
I've got some papers.
The band has to sign these.
-What is it?
-Well, it's the Roy Rogers
restaurants we bought into...
and I sold off
the Tucson property.
This is their share,
and this is mine.
Now, I figure that cancels out
half my father's debt...
but check your records,
make sure we agree.
-Walter, what are you
payin' them back for?
-Huh?
They're used to people
stealin' from 'em.
This is only gonna confuse 'em.
They've got too much money now as it is.
You're their manager.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I like you better
than I like them.
But they're your sister
and your brothers.
The union forces me to allow you to go to
lunch in spite of the way you've played.
Those of you with consciences
will not be able to eat.
And those of you whose consciences
match your talents...
go stuff yourselves.
I hope you choke.
Jog with me, Wally.
I don't wanna break
my rhythm.
-How long have you
been doing this, Jack?
-Oh, six months. It's great.
Next month I'm gonna run in a 1 -K.
Would you believe it?
Before I started this,
I couldn't fit into these clothes.
I feel better. I look better.
I sweat better.
-So you called my office.
-
-Do you have some good news for me?
-Good news?
When you hear what I got for you,
just remember this is a conservative club.
Don't rip off my shoes
and kiss my feet.
-You don't have to worry about that.
-
You asked for an apartment?
Something nice, yet affordable?
Uh, Jack, could you sweat
the other way, please?
-Wally, will you listen to me?
-Not if you keep calling me Wally.
-
-Oh.
-What is that?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's a pulse alarm.
-Well, maybe we should stop.
-No, no, no.
These things are unreliable.
Walter, can you get your hands on
$200,000 by close of business Friday?
-
-Well, let me see.
If I sell everything I own,
maybe I can buy you lunch.
-
-Jack?
-
-Jack? Jack, are you all right?
-I'm fine, really.
-Take it easy, Mr Schnittman.
-Has this ever happened before?
-Yeah.
Seven times
in the past five months.
-I thought jogging was getting you
in better shape.
-It is.
Yeah. Thanks to the jogging,
now I can lift him into the ambulance.
I just want an apartment. My girlfriend's
ex-husband returned from Europe today.
That's nice.
Why would somebody sell
a million-dollar house for 200,000?
Who knows?
A divorce, loan sharks...
drugs, sudden death.
The point is: You get to capitalize
on a fellow human being's misfortune.
That's the basis of real estate.
Have we got a deal?
-
-
-Thank you. So are you.
-
Why did we ever
get divorced?
-So we could look better,
for one reason.
-Hmm.
-Can I speak frankly?
-Anything's possible.
Anna, I have learned
that my life is meaningless without you.
I know we made
a mess of things before...
but I wanna put the past behind us
and begin again fresh...
and at the same time
older and wiser.
-Can we do that?
-No.
-What do you mean "no"? Why not?
-I love Walter.
-"Walter"? What Walter?
-Oh, Max, you know exactly what Walter.
-Don't be ridiculous.
He's not even a musician.
-Many people aren't.
Anna, please,
I have finally discovered...
there is only one person
in the world who matters to me.
And that's you.
I've known that for a long time.
No. You love me,
and I love you.
love you.
love Walter.
-Will you stop saying that?
-Max, it's over for us. Over.
All right.
Then just go to bed with me.
Yeah, I know. Party's over for you guys.
You'll have to go home.
Some girl called.
Said she'd taken a lot of pills...
and was gonna kill herself
if you didn't call her.
-She really sounds bad.
-
I think she sounds awful,
but she sold six million records last year.
-Walter!
-Hey, how are ya?
I gotta get some food
right now!
Okay, we promised never to come to your
place again, but this is a major crisis.
It's not my place
any more.
When your father took all our money,
you were so nice to us.
-You washed my hair.
I didn't forget that.
-
We trust you.
We need your advice.
I am sure I did not
wash your hair.
Look, I gotta get up early
tomorrow and go see Benny.
-You see Benny?
-
-What's your problem?
-We want to change the name of the band.
You can't do that!
You've spent years and a fortune...
to make your name
a household word.
Your name is perfect.
"Cheap Girls." I love it.
-I'm not sure it's us.
-
-It is.
-We wanna call ourselves "Meryl Streep."
-
No, no. You cannot call yourselves
"Meryl Streep."
-
-No, in fact, considering your act...
I think I can guarantee
a giant lawsuit.
-
-
Don't take off your coat.
Forget it.
You are not calling yourselves
"Meryl Streep."
-Come on, we're gonna go see a house.
-A house? Where?
An hour away
from everyone.
Thanks very much.
Keep the change.
-This can't be it.
-It's the address.
I know.
Somethin' must be wrong.
Well, let's go see.
-Hi! Come on in.
-
Mmm.
Excuse the way
the place looks.
I really let it go to hell
since Carlos left.
But the house
is beautiful.
Carlos and I
were very happy here.
It's all over now.
The living room's in here.
-This is great.
-Fabulous.
Well, I think that we'd like
to decorate it ourselves.
I'd sell it cheap.
I need all the money I can get.
Goddam bloodsucking lawyers
are bleeding me dry.
The floor just needs a little polish.
The bedroom's up here.
I'm trying to save a few bucks on the
lights... for the bloodsucking lawyers.
-
-
There's a tricky step.
I keep meaning to fix it.
What a beautiful bed.
-Could I use your bathroom?
-Would you use the one downstairs?
All my personal things
are still in this one.
Oh. Sure.
Happiest moments of my life
since we left Paraguay...
have been spent
right here in this room.
You lived in Paraguay?
Ten wonderful years.
Carlos is from Asuncion.
Or at least he...
I'm awfully sorry.
About what?
I don't know actually.
Do you wanna
buy the bed?
l-I think so.
You know, you think
you know somebody...
after 25 years...
and then one day...
Israeli Intelligence
comes to the door.
Israeli Intelligence?
Last Tuesday.
That's why I've gotta sell the house.
It turns out,
Carlos was Hitler's pool man.
-
-Mm-hmm.
Ouch!
There's a lot of grounds,
but the maintenance isn't too bad.
-I've always done it myself,
but you could hire a gardener.
-"A gardener"? No, no.
I could handle this.
This'd be a piece of cake.
Really?
-
-
-What's it called again?
-It's a Lincoln.
-They don't make 'em like this any more.
-It's a beauty.
Do you like it? I'll throw it in
if you buy the house.
That's very generous.
I'm desperate.
Can we close?
Well, we need
a little time to...
There isn't any time.
Extradition is Friday.
-Extradition?
-I'll tell you later.
-I need an answer
by close of business tomorrow.
-
By the way, you have the most
beautifully kept pool I've ever seen.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What did I say?
What did I say?
Jack was right.
We can't lose.
-Nothing can be this easy.
-Sure it can. You know what this is?
-This is the short line
in Motor Vehicles.
-What?
You go to Motor Vehicles
to get your licence renewed...
and you get on this line
that reaches to Spain.
And right next to it is this little
short line with only two guys on it.
But you don't get on that line, 'cause you
think something must be wrong with it...
otherwise everybody else would be
on it, so you waste three hours.
I got on the short line once.
It was for farm vehicles.
I want this house. I need this house.
We need this house.
-Could be great.
-Say "yes"!
If we do this,
we do it together.
I'm putting in half the money,
or I'm not going in.
-Great!
-I thought you'd give me an argument.
If I had any money, I would.
Where are you gonna get your half?
Max.
I'm goin' straight to the top on this
one... Billboard's Artist of the Year.
-
-Benny?
-Yeah.
-
-
-Did you hear that?
The train is coming, right when
we decided to buy the house!
-
-This has got to be an omen.
I can feel it! This is it!
Everything's breaking for us!
You say you have
an appointment?
I don't  I have
an appointment, I  an appointment!
-Hi, Mr Fielding.
-Hello.
-
-
Okay, you've seen me. Is that it,
or do you wanna talk too?
I wanna talk.
Figures.
All right.
You've got five minutes.
Are you gonna let my mother
clean that carpet?
-Thanks, Benny.
-Don't mention it.
-
-Don't mention that either.
He never eats.
Hey, keep it brief.
I got a chick waiting in the Jacuzzi.
I wish I had
a hundred more like him.
There is a house
I want to buy.
I want you to loan me
$200,000 in cash.
No.
-Benny!
-
-You shout at me?
-
I need that money,
and you're gonna loan it to me!
-I will not! No! No! No!
-
Yes, you will! I saved you
ten times that in taxes last year!
-So what?
-Benny, if you don't
loan me that money, I'll...
-You'll what, huh? You'll what?
-I'll not like you any more!
-All right.
-Thanks.
-
- Great!
-
-
-
-
Way to go!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
How's it going?
Fine. What's that
on your face?
The ceiling.
Seems to be coming down
in the bedroom.
Oh. Well, I'll get to that later.
I only got two hands.
-Okay.
-
What the hell
was that?
All I did was
turn on the water.
-That's all?
-
That doesn't sound good.
No.
You should see the...
I guess it's the water.
-I don't know. It's revolting.
-
So the plumbing's
not perfect.
We'll get it fixed.
It's not the end of the world.
-You didn't see that water!
-Look, this is an old house.
It's gonna need some work.
You've gotta expect that.
I didn't expect
that water. It had legs.
A little work,
a little care...
a little imagination,
and it's gonna be great!
It's gonna be fun
fixing it up. You'll see.
I don't know. I've never been
any good at that kind of thing.
-What kind of thing?
-Work.
You can't go into it with that kind of
attitude. You've gotta be more positive.
-I'll try.
-Oh.
A little care,
a little imagination...
and a positive attitude.
What was that?
Nothing, dear.
Son of a bitch.
-
-
-Oh, Walter!
-The stairs are out!
Honey,
you're on my fingers.
Oh...
Sorry.
I'd help you with that, but somebody
stepped on all my fingers.
-I said I was sorry.
-
I didn't expect your fingers
to be on the floor.
I know.
I'm just cranky.
I guess it's having just thrown
$200,000 into the toilet.
Either that
or the intense pain.
It's only the first day.
You're not gonna give up on it already.
-Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
-Oh, no.
No, you're not.
I'm not gonna let you.
There's a chance we could fob it off
on the Cheap Girls.
We're not
going to sell it.
The land, at least,
has got to be worth something.
The house
is going to be great!
Yeah, if we can peel
the rind off it.
-What?
-It's a lemon, honey, let's face it.
You can't just quit.
I'm a quitter,
and I'm not ready to quit yet.
-
-
-
-
-
-Lady, this is impossible.
-
-I feel like I'm gonna die.
You're not going to die.
I'm holding the ladder.
If you fall,
land on the mattress.
Hello. Yes. Yes. We're having some
problems with our plumbing, and I was...
-
-Fielding. Walter Fielding.
-
-
There's no reason why
you should've heard of me.
-Somebody here call a carpenter?
-Oh, yes. We did.
-
-I wasn't really holding it, anyway.
How much
do I make a year?
Uh, how much
do you make a year?
Really?
-
-You're kidding, right?
-
-
-
-Hey!
-
-Hey, let go of her! That's my wife!
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm sorry.
I just thought she was
good-lookin' wool.
Look, I don't wanna
cause trouble.
If I came on a little strong,
I'm sorry, okay?
-No, it's not okay.
-Just get out of here.
Well, okay.
If that's what you want.
I think we should call
the police.
Hey, let's not
get nuts here.
-
-Who are you anyway?
Art Shirk. I'm the carpenter.
I think we spoke on the phone.
-You're the carpenter?
-Yeah. Well, I guess I'll be going.
Oh, wait a minute! Just wait a minute.
Maybe we can clear this up.
I know, but he's supposed to be
a really good carpenter.
-He tried to attack me.
-He just thought you were
good-lookin' wool...
an attractive woman.
-
-I don't know who  are.
Look, uh...
do you know how hard it is to find
a really good carpenter?
Besides, I think
he's got a brother who's a plumber.
-Really? A brother who's a plumber?
-I think so.
-Do you think I should sleep with him?
-Maybe just this once.
I think I'm going to start dinner.
Great.
Great!
-Hey, I'm sorry about that...
-Oh, it's all right.
You'll have plenty
of opportunities to make it up to us.
You know, usually a woman
calls a carpenter...
she's lookin' for
the old "hammer and nail."
-And I don't mean...
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
-Yes, I did.
-
Now,
what was over there?
The stairs. It began right there
and it curved all the way...
-
-
Oh, my God!
No, don't!
-
-What's the matter?
I was just
lighting the oven.
Just lighting... You could've
been killed! We could've all died!
Oh, well,
thank you very much.
I'm not completely helpless
in the kitchen.
I do know how
to light an oven.
Well, yeah, but...
-You mean this thing works?
-
Well, it's amazing.
What about the, uh...
-What do you call these?
-The burners.
-I haven't tried them yet.
-Maybe we shouldn't press our luck.
-Wanna see the refrigerator?
-No.
Water?
-
-No water.
We've got gas and electricity, though.
That's two out of three.
Art's calling his brother.
Oh, good news.
You're not gonna have
to sleep with him.
Just a little dinner,
some dancing.
-How long do you think all that'll take?
-Two weeks.
Really? That's all?
When do you think you could start?
Just as soon
as your cheque clears.
Couldn't you at least hang the door?
I've got enough cash for that.
Haven't got
the right materials.
Wood's rotten.
Won't hold a screw.
Which reminds me:
-I'm late for my next job.
-
-If you know what I mean.
-
-
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
in spite of the prospect of indentured
servitude for the rest of my life...
in debt beyond
my wildest dreams...
I love the house.
So do I.
And I love you.
-Life is good.
-
-
-
Prostate trouble?
-
-
-
-
We have very weak trees.
"Weak trees"?
I guess that's the door.
Hurry, don't let it ring again.
Wait!
-You Fielding?
-Right!
My brother Art
recommended you.
-I don't usually take jobs in this area.
-I'm glad you can make an exception.
-Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?
-I'm sorry.
-Where should we start?
-Well, you could offer me a drink.
I don't know
where my manners are.
Here it is, nearly 11:30.
You must be parched.
And we're not going to,
not with your attitude.
Oh, saving the good scotch
for the company, are we?
No wonder you've been turned down
by every plumber in the valley.
-That's not true!
-Don't make it worse by lying.
I'm not lying!
I haven't tried everybody yet.
Please,
you gotta help me!
I don't know.
Write me a cheque quick,
before I come to my senses. Five grand.
-Five grand... Five thousand dollars?
-That's just a deposit.
You didn't even...
Well...
I'm not tryin' to tell you your business,
but you haven't even looked at my pipes.
I looked at them three years ago.
You figure they've improved with age?
-
-
Prep school.
Yale.
Phi Beta Kappa.
Four years of law school,
law review.
Are you all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
The secret is not to,
uh, look down.
Oh, why did you
say that?
Look down?
It's a secret.
I was fine
till you said that.
I'm sorry.
You're doin' great.
-Mm-hmm.
-Just great.
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna share this bath with you...
-because I can't do this a second time.
-Ooh!
I think that's
a swell idea.
That way you can save your energy
for more worthwhile causes.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Would you get the rest
of the water, okay?
-
-
Hi, this is Julia Child with a tip
on making crepes Suzette...
-
-
-
-
Let it bubble up well,
and then dip it into your flames...
Ow!
Little problem in the kitchen.
Nothing trivial.
Well,
the turkey's done.
So is the kitchen.
Actually, it's a little overdone
for my taste.
Let's not
go there again.
-You don't want to
tell me what happened?
-No, I don't.
-I just want to relax
in a nice lukewarm bath.
-What about this?
What are you doing?
-Save yourself.
-What?
I'm a menace
to anything I touch.
The Surgeon General's warning
should be tattooed across my forehead.
"Walter Fielding is dangerous
to your health. Don't touch him."
-
-I can't.
-I've tried, but I love Walter Fielding.
-No.
-I can't give him up.
I'm hopelessly addicted.
-No.
You must think of yourself!
I am sinking fast into the money pit...
and I don't want to
drag you down with me.
-Save yourself
while there's still time.
-Walter, brighten up.
-I hate seeing you like this.
-I hate being like this. I'm a disaster.
These are estimates from legitimate
contractors for repairs on the pit.
Those that will actually come out here
are so expensive, I can't talk about it.
Let's not talk about it.
I've just given
our last $5,000...
our last 5,000 borrowed dollars...
to the Shirks.
Walter, I don't mean
to be questioning you, but why...
They were willing to take it!
The legitimate people wanted
four times as much just to say "hello."
So it's the Shirks.
That's not so bad.
Well, that's if they show up.
Just because they showed up
to collect the money...
is no guarantee that
they'll show up to do the work.
And if they do,
I can't pay for it!
-I'm going to help you.
-Do you have a gun?
"Here lies Walter Fielding.
He bought a house, and it killed him."
If I could raise some more money,
would that help?
-Depends on how you're gonna
raise the money.
-Mmm.
-I think I know how.
-I  you know how.
Just stop.
I've got some things I can sell.
I don't wanna talk about money
or the house any more tonight.
Neither do I. We could just skip town,
borrow some bus fare.
Or we could hitchhike,
hit the open road.
Everything's gonna be
just fine.
-You'll see. Trust me.
-How?
-Don't you trust me?
-It's not that. It's just that...
We'll think of somethin'.
Who cares?
-What's happening?
-Well, stay here. I'll find out.
Hi. You must be
Mr Fielding.
-Yeah. Yeah. Who...
-I'm from Shirk Brothers.
Your number came up in the drawing
this morning. We work today!
Oh, that's great.
That's... Where is Brad?
Oh, South of France,
I think.
Uh, don't...
Shouldn't he be here?
Brad is the executive plumber.
We do all the work.
We're just about
to get started.
You're free to watch if you want,
though I wouldn't recommend it.
-Are there any living things in there?
-Well, my girlfr...
-My wife. What the hell.
-Oh, I'd get her out.
Hold it, fellas. Just a second.
There's a woman inside there.
Hold it!
Come on!
Hey, come on! Wait a minute, fellas,
there's a lady inside there.
H-Here! Here she...
H-Here you go. Okay?
Are you all right?
-Yes, thank you.
-Is everything out?
-Yeah.
-
-Okay. Have a nice day!
-Who are they?
-The plumbers.
-Are you sure?
No, and I don't care. I'm just thrilled
to see somebody actually working.
Mrs Fielding,
don't worry about a thing.
-Okay, guys, let's do it!
-Yeah!
I'll sell it
to you for 75.
That painting
doesn't interest me.
Yes, it does.
You love that painting.
That's the only reason
I took it.
All you want
to talk about is money.
Let's talk about love and sex.
Forget love, let's just talk about sex.
Max, I'm desperate.
I need money.
I need new plumbing.
I need new appliances.
-A new staircase, Max.
-Stop, please. Too boring.
-Plastering, landscaping,
painting, a roof.
-Too middle class. Stop.
New floors, new tiles,
new fixtures in the bathroom.
Okay, okay, I'll buy it.
I'll give you the money.
Only, please, God,
stop!
Thank you, Max.
Sometimes you can be very sweet.
I know.
-How do I look in this?
-Oh, beautiful.
You look beautiful
in everything. Mm-hmm.
Hi!
Hi.
What happened?
It was no picnic, but those boys
are work animals.
-Well, everything looks
pretty well under control.
-It does?
They completely ripped up
our house!
They're work animals,
I'm telling you!
Look at
those holes!
Then you got
your gravel piles...
your sand piles,
your scrap piles.
-Animals!
-Animals.
Well, I like a good conversation
as well as anybody, but I gotta run.
if you know what I mean.
-Y-You're leaving?
-Well, I ain't movin' in.
But we'll be back
when you get your permits.
Permits? The permit man
was supposed to be here by 4:00.
Oh, he was, but you or your wife
weren't here to meet him.
We weren't?
Anna's not here?
No, no.
I would've noticed.
The permit man
was pretty agitated.
Really steamed his clams.
Said he'd be back
when you grow udders and get milked.
-
-That's a long time.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, if he ever does come back,
you call me and we'll finish the job.
When I do get the permits,
how long will the job take?
Two weeks.
Two weeks?
Two weeks?
You sound like a parakeet.
"Two weeks? Two weeks?"
Well, uh, two weeks.
It's... It's amazing.
-Amazing, nothing.
-
It'll be a regular miracle.
-
-
Hello?
Oh, hi there.
"Tone"?
My voice has no tone.
Because I'm standing
in a pile of rubble...
and we don't
have the permits to un-rubble it.
"Exaggerating"? Honey, we're living
in Swiss cheese with a door.
"Mozart"? Mozart is dead.
His troubles are over.
Help
All right. I'm sorry.
You're right. If you had to work,
you had to work.
Oh, l-l-I love you too.
Where is the guy's number?
The permit man.
In the den, you think.
I will pick you up
at the station.
Just give me a call
when you get there.
"Shrapp"?
Is Mr Shrapp in?
Mr Shrapp.
Walter Fielding.
Hey, watch what you say
about my mother, now.
Mr Shrapp,
let's be adults about this.
I'm... Look, I'm very sorry
I wasn't here this afternoon.
My wife was poisoned
and taken to the hospital.
Well, what would
cut any ice with you?
A bribe? Sure.
Can you be here in a half an hour?
All right.
Cash? No problem.
Weasel.
Cash.
Cash, cash, ca...
H-Help!

-
-Hello...
Hello!
Hello! I'm here!
Are you in there,
Fielding?
Y-Yeah!
l-I'm here.
M-My chest
is constricted.
I can't shout.
O-Oww! Oww!
Okay, Fielding,
I can hear you in there laughing at me.
This is it,
you duck fart!
I'm leaving, and I'm never coming back!
Ya hear me, Fielding?
Y-Y-Yes, I hear you!
There!
Nobody laughs
at Montgomery Shrapp!
You testin' missiles here,
or what?
The house
is gonna be great.
Shh.
Oh, my God.
Walter!
Oh!
Oh, A-Anna!
Thank God it's you!
Thank God! Ohh!
Walter?
-
-Is that you?
Is it me?
Ha! Is it me?
Walter?
Walter?
Upstairs!
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.
Not at all.
No!
-
-I'm in the den.
I'm in the den. I swear it.
Please believe me.
I'm right here.
I'm right here!
Where?
In the floor,
behind the chair.
Ohh!
Oh, laughing.
-
-We're laughing.
The permit man was here.
-Oh, that's good.
-No, it's not.
Now tomorrow I've got to
take off work, drive to his office...
and kiss his ass.
-Oh!
-
-
-Well, thanks to that fall
we're now the same height.
Yeah, that's much better.
-So, why did rehearsal run so long?
-That was my fault.
We got off to a late start because I was
haggling with Max over the painting.
How, exactly, would you
define "haggling"?
-What do you mean by that?
-I thought that was my question.
Are you jealous
of Max?
Jealous of Max?
Don't be silly.
Just because he's rich, famous,
good-looking, brilliant.
-I mean, what's he got
that I haven't got?
-Walls.
I feel much better.
Good night, hon.
Good night.
Look out for that thing.
You're gonna fall off of it.
Get to work!
They're not even half done.
They said two weeks for the whole job.
You're telling me this
like I haven't been here.
We're going through
a rough time.
-Let's remember not to
take it out on each other.
-You're right.
You hear about that guy up in the Bronx,
went crazy, thought he was a pigeon?
They found him in the park
throwing bread crumbs at himself.
-He was just putting in
a guest bathroom.
-Okay.
So let's be nice to each other.
We're all we've got.
Don't forget
to get the water.
-Haven't I gotten the water
every morning for four months?
-Walter.
-Do I ever forget the water?
-Don't do this. Walter, Walter, Walter!
I'm sorry.
The bucket's
in the hall.
I know where the bucket is.
You don't have to tell me
where the bucket is.
Stairs!
Ha!
A staircase!
We have stairs!
Oh, hello, Mr Stairs.
I've missed you.
Anna?
Anna, darling!
We have stairs!
It's happening, honey.
Everything's
gonna be fixed.
We have stairs.
That's terrific.
-
-Yes.
Yeah. Right away.
S-Say, Curly?
-Yo!
-
We're a little busy today, Walter,
tryin' to build a house.
I'll get it myself.
I'll use my new stairs.
Tar bucket comin' down.
-Morning, James.
-Morning!
-Alka-Seltzer.
-Just a minute.
Any idea when you're going
to be finished here?
-Two weeks.
-That's what I thought.
Alka-Seltzer.
Here you go.
Oh. You know you're almost out
of birth control pills?
Thank you, James.
Walter.
Walter!
The water! I know.
I'm getting it.
You want this room painted blue,
like in the hallway?
No, I do not. That's all wood...
What do you mean, "like the hallway"?
The hallway.
Blue, right?
I want nothing blue.
Nothing!
Oh, man. Now I gotta go flush out
my paint sprayer.
Oh, that's a bummer.
-
-Have you seen Mr Fielding?
-Fielding?
-Yeah.
Don't know any Fieldings
around here. In Cincinnati...
Walter?
Oh, Walter!
Yeah, Walter.
He was supposed to bring me
a bucket of water.
-Bring you some water?
-Yeah. Do... No...
-Ohh! Ohh!
-How's that?
It's a miracle.
Yeah!
##
Walter.
-I wanna ask you something.
You're a lawyer, right?
-Yeah.
Last year my father
was hit in the head by a golf ball.
-
-Oh, can I unplug...
Now, he seemed okay...
but last week
we were watching TV...
and I put on the Bob Hope
Desert Classic from Palm Springs.
He goes friggin' nuts!
My father, not Bob Hope.
So he kicks in
the friggin' TV screen. Now...
I'd have to study it, but I'd say you got
a great case against Bob Hope.
Thanks, man.
Aaah!
##
##
##
-That was not so bad.
-
-
-I am not unhappy with it.
You have my congratulations,
and you may go home.
-
-But don't you want to hear it back?
No, if there's something wrong
with it it's your fault...
and you will hang for it.
Do you have
a cigarette?
I'm sorry.
It was beautiful,
Max.
Better than Szell's version?
Mmm, I wondered why you did this.
I know you never liked it.
Well?
-It was better.
-Thank you.
It's a pity
that son of a bitch isn't alive...
because it would kill him
to hear that.
Have you got
a cigarette?
You stopped smoking
five years ago.
I started again
two weeks ago.
Can I have
the damn cigarette?
Mmm.
Filters.
You seem a little tense.
Your shoulders are up
over your ears.
-
-Don't I look all right?
In a word, no.
The only good part of our divorce
was that it seemed to make you happy.
For you to be without me
unhappy...
is such a waste.
You are making me sad.
Walter's
in Philadelphia...
and the idea of going back
to that house, alone...
Oh, God.
Why don't we have dinner
and a huge amount of alcohol?
I'm not dressed
for a restaurant.
My place.
Our old place.
-You can have a hot bath.
-
We'll have a fire. Hwang will make
anything you want for dinner.
-Duck I'orange.
-
Twelve-year-old scotch.
In clean glasses.
That can be arranged.
I'm not going to bed
with you.
I may not ask you.
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
-Oh, my God.
-What's wrong?
What happened?
What did we do?
-What have we done? Oh, my God!
-Calm down.
-You were a little looped.
You sang a few songs.
-The Beatles?
-The entire catalogue.
-What else?
-You don't remember?
-It was duck for dinner. Right?
-Followed by crepe Suzettes.
-I don't remember the crepe Suzettes.
-You don't remember the piano?
-No.
- the piano?
-I don't wanna hear any more.
-It was incredible. Better than Zurich.
-
-The police came.
You don't remember any of this?
-
My shoe!
-
-Last night you were
the animal I remember.
-
-Come back to me, and the police
will come every night.
-I love you.
-
Last night you said
you loved me...
that we would be together
the rest of our lives.
-When are you going to tell Walter?
-
-You're just going to walk out
on him without saying anything?
-
I am in love with him.
Not you, him.
-No, this whole wonderful realization
has confused you.
-
Talk this over with Walter,
and you'll see.
-Lying.
-What?
-No. Tell him the truth.
-I'll lose him.
-Hey, take a chance.

-They testin' missiles here?
That's right, buddy, we are,
and it's very hush-hush. Top secret.
So forget you were up here
and forget you saw any of this.
-And forget about a tip.
-
# I am a pizza #
-# Ready to munch #
-Ah, home, crap home.
-
-
I still can't get used to the idea of
having hot water whenever we want it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-So, what'd you do last night?
-
Where'd you eat?
What?
Oh.
The Four Seasons.
Well, I'm glad it wasn't
anything special.
Actually,
it was a little special.
We had just done probably
the finest performance...
of Haydn's
Surprise Symphony ever.
Really.
Uh, please tell me
you didn't pay.
I didn't.
Max took us.
-Well, that must have been
some performance.
-
How was Max?
Fine!
I mean, he was very pleased
with himself.
He asked after you.
-Oh, that's... that's very nice.
-Mm-hmm.
Did you sleep with him?
I hope you don't mind.
-Of course, we can't go back
to the Four Seasons again.
-
Did you?
Did you?
Are you serious?
Well, I know you weren't here
last night...
because I called,
and, uh, guess what.
I don't know.
You tell me.
-
-No answer.
Walter, do you want to tell me
what you're saying?
I'm not saying anything.
for example, that you'd spent last night
with Max... that you would tell me...
You're just going
to have to trust me.
Oh, l-I trust you.
I do trust you. I just want you
to tell me the truth.
Well, I did.
Well, then,
that's the end of it.
You would tell me,
wouldn't you?
-Walter.
-I just want you to be honest with me.
I can take anything
except lies.
People slip up.
Christ, I understand that.
It happens all the time.
I mean, I'm not some meathead
chauvinist provincial.
-Is that all?
-No. No.
I'm jealous.
I'm very jealous of Max.
I'm not crazy about the idea
of you sleeping with him, but if
you did it and didn't tell me...
that would really
bother me.
Without changing my plea,
I would like to know why.
Because
it underestimates me.
Not telling me assumes I'm incapable
of understanding why you did it.
Not that you did it.
Had you done it.
Did you?
You want me to tell you the truth,
no matter how much it hurts.
If we can't be honest with each other,
what else have we got?
And you'll believe in me?
You'll understand?
Of course I will.
I love you.
I love you too, but I did not sleep
with Max last night.
No?
Can we knock this off
and go to sleep?
I love you.
Mmm.
I love you.
-
-
-Walter!
- Walter.
-Are you awake?
-Yeah!
Yeah, I'm awake.
What is it?
I have to talk to you.
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna do this. It's so stupid.
What is it?
What's the matter?
I lied to you
about Max.
Apparently I went
to his apartment, I got drunk...
I guess I sang
a few songs...
and apparently I, um...
slept with him.
-I know I shouldn't be telling you this.
-No. No.
It's okay.
It's only proved to me
how much I love you.
Oh, that sounds stupid too,
but it's true.
I love you, Walter.
I love you.
I love you.
It's okay.
Everything's okay.
You won't hold it against me?
You can forgive me?
Sure. Can we talk about this
in the morning?
I'm so tired.
Do we have to talk about it?
Can't we just put this behind us?
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you.
-
-
I leave town for 5 minutes, you can't
wait to leap into the sack with old Max!
You... !
-That's right! Laying it off on me!
-You hypocrite!
-I'm not the one screwing around!
-"Just be honest with me."
-How long has this been going on?
-You chauvinist meathead!
I'm not telling you
anything!
Now or ever again!
Oh, this is perfect! Guess who suddenly
turns into the injured party!
-Where do you think you're going?
-Someplace where you're not!
-Well, then, you stay here,
because I'm leaving!
-Fine!
Get out! I never want
to see you again!
The plasterer came?

What happened?
Your old lady kick you out?
I do not wish to discuss
my domestic difficulties with you, Julio.
That's okay. I figure she
threw his ass out.
-No, she did not throw my ass out!
-No, you had your chance, man.
This is between
me and Duke.
I'm not payin' you guys to stand around.
You wanna get to work?
We can't do nothin'
till the plumbin' inspector gets here.
There's no plumbing
in that wall.
-No?
-We can take off and you can
call us when he gets here.
Just stay where you are.
I fell for that one before.
Ooh! Ohh!
I didn't sleep very well.
You look great.
Got a date?
Yes,
with the Marine Corps Band.
I'm starting with the brass, and I'm
working my way to the drum section.
-Don't you think we should talk?
-This is not the time.
-I'm mad, and I'm getting madder.
-Oh! What do you think I am?
-I think you're a jerk.
-I know that.
-I didn't realize how big a jerk
I was until last night.
-Neither did I.
Let's just pack it in, then. Let's just
finish this thing right here and now!
-Fine.
-I'll pack a bag for you
and send the rest later.
-You expect  to move out?
-You shouldn't have
any trouble finding a bed.
-I got a bed, lady.
-Get the hell outta here!
This is private!
What makes you think you can
just throw me out of my own house?
the one
who's moving.
I have worked and slaved...
and put myself in hock up to my eyes...
I have worked and slaved and suffered for
this house every bit as much as you have!
Actually more, because
I had to put up with you!
This is ridiculous!
You don't even like this house!
I love this house!
You've done nothing but complain
about it since we got here!
I did one other thing... I sunk every
nickel I had in the world in this house!
-And you'll get it all back!
-Me and everyone you've ever met!
"I'll pay you back"
will be written on your gravestone!
I wouldn't give lectures
on the value of promises!
-Your word didn't do too well
on this last outing!
- is fine!
It's certainly a lot better
than your cheque!
I'll get you
your money back!
It's a big house!
We'll divide it up!
You stay in your half,
I'll stay in mine!
That is such a dumb idea.
Sometimes it amazes me
you ever passed the bar.
I'm sure it does.
You've never passed a bar in your life.
You are so much less attractive
when I'm sober.
-Thank goodness it's not that often.
-All right, that's it!
I've had it with you, the house,
Max, the orchestra and everything!
How long will it take
to put this place together?
-Two weeks.
-
Okay, we'll stick it out
until the house is finished.
Then we'll sell it, get our money back
and get the hell away from each other.
Fine.
Get back to work!
Bam! Zoom!
What are you doing here?
-You missed a rehearsal.
-That's right.
-Did you tell Walter
what happened between us?
-Yes.
And what
did he say?
Walter and I are through.
-I hate us both.
-You'll get over it.
-You'll come back to me.
-No.
I'm just going away
someplace.
You can't go anywhere.
We have performances.
You don't understand. I have to
get away from here, from both of you.
You are leaving
the symphony?
What have I done?
Oh, it wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
I was weak.
What?
I made it up.
You made what up, Max?
You slept in the bedroom.
I slept in the living room.
Sex would have been
a miracle.
Oh, Max!
I wanted you back, and I truly thought
I could make you happy this time.
Oh, Max.
Tell Walter the truth.
No.
He couldn't forgive me,
and I can't forgive him for that.
He's lost a wonderful woman,
and I know what that's like.
I've lost many.
-You must hate me.
-No.
I used to hate you.
Now I hate Walter.
Lucky guy.
-Walter!
-Well, this is an unexpected revulsion.
Are you hot?
Can I take your life?
I can see
that my presence here...
could be construed
as in poor taste.
-No!
-Do you realize what you've done?
one of the great women
on the face of this Earth...
and thrown her away.
I've lost her too, but I'll get over it
because I am shallow and self-centred.
But you, you won't
because you are complex.
This is turning out to be
a pretty good day.
-Good day.
-##
Smooth strokes.
Up and down.
Paint,
don't tickle.
And don't smoke.
Well, folks, I guess this is
"so-long-a."
You know,
just between us...
there were a couple of times
when I didn't think we'd ever be
able to put this baby back up.
-But it, uh, it turned out.
-It's beautiful, Curly.
It is, really, much better
than I imagined.
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.
One more job, though.
Here's your key.
It's the only one I've got.
Who wants it?
Hmm?
Well, I'll just put it
on the bannister here.
-
-Great.
No, this wasn't an easy one, but the
foundation was good, I'll say that.
And if that's okay,
then everything else can be fixed.
Well, goodbye, folks.
Good luck.
Well, this is it.
Are you going
to spend the night here?
No. You?
I'm already packed.
I'd better get packed
myself.
I'll get my bags.
Walter?
Walter?
This step.
This... This was our step.
This is where
it all started to...
Turn to crap.
Too late to put it
back together, isn't it?
You slept with Max,
and I don't care.
What?
I don't care.
Well, I care, but not enough
for us to be apart.
Really?
Really.
I'm glad you slept with him, because now
I know how much I really love you.
You sleeping with Max was the best thing
that could've happened to us.
I didn't sleep with him.
Thank God.

Look at me! Hey! Walter!
A big smile!
Hold it! Hold it there!
One more! Ready?
It's a very nice house,
and the price is reasonable.
Reasonable? It's a steal.
Oh, honey!
It's so beautiful.
You buy or not?
-We're buying.

You can count it if you like,
but you'll find it's all there.
We haven't got all day!
Let's go!

Ah.
