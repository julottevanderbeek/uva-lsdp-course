Kiss my buzzer, will ya?
Dombrowsky,
you having trouble with your back?
- No, Mr Gant.
- Then take more of those crates.
Kovak, load him up.
C'mon, c'mon.
He can take more than that. More.
All right. Now keep moving.
We haven't got all day.
Four crates of tomatoes
out of your pocket. The company says...
- You made me put 'em there, sir.
- You break 'em, you pay for 'em.
Did you hear me?
- I heard you, sir.
- All right.
Get down there and pick 'em up, boy.
Hurry it up! We're running late.
- Come on, we'll get 'em up.
- Get back to work!
What do you guys think you're doing?
Get back to work, all of ya!
Samuels.
Didn't you hear me?!
Samuels! You're fired!
- Get your voucher.
- I didn't hear you, Mr Gant.
Get out, get out. You're fired.
Johnny? Johnny,
I didn't hear him. I didn't.
- Hadn't you better get this fish inside?
- What's it to you, Mac?
The name's Monahan. Mike Monahan.
- Mind your own business.
- It is my business.
- It's gonna spoil if you don't get it inside.
- What do we care?
- I want the wagon unloaded.
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- I'm the driver.
- Hey!
What are you trying to pull? You know
where that stuff goes. Get it inside!
We don't need any lazy bastards
around here. You hear me, Belkin?
- You, too, Kovak. You're another...
- You call me a bastard, I'll lay you out.
Well, I guess a job don't mean nothing
to a rich man like you.
That's out of your pay, Kovak!
- What are you doing?!
- I wanna see Boss Andrews!
I'll give you Andrews.
You're fired! Get the hell outta here!
I wanna see Andrews!
Andrews! Andrews! Andrews!
I'm glad you told me about this.
You've got some legitimate complaints.
Let's agree on this. From now on, Gant
can't fire anyone without my approval.
How's that?
How about paying for something
you drop by accident?
From now on, anything that's accidentally
damaged, you don't have to pay for it.
What about overtime?
Being paid waiting for deliveries?
I won't lie to you. That's out of my hands.
I'll have to talk to my superiors. All right?
We'll try to be fair.
But to be fair all around,
you fellers'll go back to work
and move that load inside.
Wait. How do we know you're gonna
talk to 'em about the extra pay?
You have my word.
By the way, Mr Kovak, I'd like to praise
you for bringing this to my attention.
The problems will be corrected.
Do we have a deal?
All right.
We got a deal.
- Johnny Kovak!
- Lincoln Dombrowsky.
Abe Lincoln!
How about another round?
- Here's a new face. What's your name?
- Another round?
- Put it around.
- Shall I put it around?
- You break it, you pay for it.
- You pay for it!
- Look at the rosy cheeks. Are you Irish?
- What of it?
Why don't you take your hands off of me
and be a gentleman like your friend here?
A gentleman? Are my hands no good?
Hey, Johnny, you come on now.
We wrestle. Come on, for a nickel.
Well, I tell you, Jugs, it's been kind
of a hard day, but Abe is feeling good.
You wanna wrestle Jugovich? Come on!
Come on, Abe.
OK, all right. Put it down here.
Who's on me? OK.
- I don't wanna hurt you, Jugs.
- I think you need a bit more arm, Abe.
- OK.
- Zigi, you start us.
- Start it, Zig.
- Go!
Look who is here! Vince Doyle!
And look at that big-shot suit he's got on.
- Mm, mm, mm.
- You're slumming, Vince?
No, I just got
a little business with Zigi.
You hear about us at the company?
Listen, Vince. Johnny had their backs
to the wall. We almost had a walkout.
- We won, Vince.
- What did you win, kid?
- Zigi, set these guys up.
- Yeah!
Come on!
They won't let us in, John.
Number seven.
Number eight. Number nine.
What's going on here? What are you
doing? Samuels, where are you going?
- I gotta work, Johnny.
- I wanna see Andrews.
Well, well, well.
- Mr Kovak wants to see Mr Andrews.
- That's right.
Well, Mr Kovak, Mr Andrews is outta
town. But he left a little message for ya.
You're fired! All of ya!
- The winner.
- Who asked you, Vince?
You gotta go out
and try to save the world, huh, kid?
You know, it cost me a 20 to get you out.
- He said we had a deal.
- A deal? Christ, Johnny.
You don't go screwing around
with those people. You got no push.
He shook my hand, Vince. He shook
my hand, and he said we had a deal.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, why don't you come to work for
me? We'll make an honest buck together.
Always looking out for me, ain't you?
You need another stooge?
Johnny, rest it, will ya? Relax.
You don't understand us, Vince.
Johnny, c'mon.
Hey, kid.
Johnny! C'mon!
Come on, you guys. Cheer up a little.
Thanks, Moll.
Hiya, Johnny. Do you remember me?
I'm Mike Monahan.
I delivered that load of fish
the other night.
- The fish guy. What do you want?
- I thought maybe you're looking for a job.
- You did, huh?
- What kinda work?
I'm the president of the Federation
of Interstate Truckers, Local 302.
- The president is here.
- Have you heard of it?
- He's talking about the union.
- Well, it's not much of one.
Do you mind if I sit down?
I figure we got about 100 guys right now.
I don't know how you feel about unions,
but you've got a way with men.
Yeah, I did a lot for 'em.
The companies we work for
are filled with creeps like Mr Andrews.
You know, they smile
and then they stick it to you.
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Work for us as an organiser.
You go out to the warehouses
and sign up as many guys as you can.
What about my lawyer here?
We work together.
- All right, you both got a job.
- How much?
I can't pay you nothing. But I give you
a commission for every guy you sign up.
- I don't know about trucks.
- I'll show you.
- I'm not interested.
- You'd get an office.
- Might get even.
- They ain't paying.
You get a car.
You get a car?
Anna! Anna.
Do you remember me?
From the Christmas dance last year.
I asked you to dance three times
and you didn't wanna. Wait a minute.
Don't you remember?
In case you're wondering what my name
is, it's Johnny Kovak. What's yours?
- You know what it is.
- No, your last name. Everybody's got one.
- Zerinkas.
- That's pretty. Is it Polack?
- I'm Lithuanian.
- Not many Lithuanians left.
I thought most of 'em were dead.
Wanna go for a beer?
- For breakf...? I don't drink beer.
- Then let's go someplace and talk.
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Baseball, books, the Bible - I'm game.
- What do you know about the Bible?
- What do I know about the Bible?
- "An eye for an eye." It's a great book.
- Do you always lie?
If it helps me get along
with stuck-up ladies, why not?
- Where you going?
- To work.
- I'll give you a ride to the gate. C'mon.
- I don't go for rides.
C'mon, it'll impress your friend.
I just washed the car. C'mon.
You're embarrassing me.
You're making me look bad.
- Can't you even say goodbye?
- Bye!
Anna! Do all your friends there
know how stuck-up you are?
- What's your business?
- We're with the union.
Federation of Interstate Truckers.
- We just wanna talk to the guys.
- Park this outside. I'll go check upstairs.
Thank you.
What are you thanking him for?
Couple of union boys.
You can go on in,
but I need names first.
- Abe Belkin.
- Kovak. Johnny Kovak.
Keep an eye on 'em.
How are ya? My name is Johnny Kovak.
We're from the trucking union.
- We just wanna talk about...
- We're not interested.
- Aren't you...?
- We're not interested.
- I know what you said, but we wanna...
- You heard what he said.
- Yeah. What is your name?
- Richard.
Richard. OK, Abe, why don't we come
back? We'll talk to these guys later.
Who the hell are those guys?
Wait. My name's Johnny Kovak.
We're from the truckers'...
Give me a break, will ya?
Look, I pay my dues. Just leave me alone.
Come on! Five minutes!
Ah, to hell with him.
Got a meeting Friday night, St Stephen's
basement. Hope some of you show up.
Come on.
Come on, Johnny.
- How long we been out? 14 hours?
- 13. Three sign-ups.
We got two sign-ups and one maybe.
- Any trucks been around?
- It's been slow.
- Where's the driver of that rig?
- I don't know.
- Is he inside?
- I don't know.
Would you put in about 60 cents' worth of
gas? And check the oil, OK? Wait up, Abe.
- I'm beat.
- That's some rig.
Yeah.
- It's an independent.
- Mm-hm.
Higgins Hauling Service.
Hey, anybody in there?
- Get away!
- We're from the union.
- Bullshit!
- We're signing up members.
Last time somebody knocked
on my door, they took my load.
- Show him the card.
- Federation of Interstate Truckers.
- That's right.
- OK, you're with the union. Now go.
Don't you wanna do something
about the companies?
Sign up with the union,
they can't screw you.
Upside down they can screw you,
and start all over again.
Not if everybody signs up.
Yeah? I'll sign up when
everybody else has signed up.
We can give you more clout
with the companies.
You two guys!
- No, the union.
- Sure you don't just wanna collect dues?
You can make them
in what the union'll get ya.
Bullshit.
If you wanna end up like Joe Harper,
that's your business.
- What happened?
- Pushing too hard for the company,
went off the road, no insurance,
nothing for his family.
- He had a rig just like this.
- Wait a minute.
We got a meeting Friday night,
eight o'clock, St Stephen's basement.
Hey, what's your name?
Kovak, Johnny Kovak.
- What's yours?
- Tom Higgins. Everybody knows me.
I'll see you Friday. Won't I, Tom?
But I ain't gonna sign nothing.
You guys know that the companies have
been putting it to us worse than ever.
And the only way we got
of holding 'em off is by getting together.
That's what a union's all about.
All right, Joe. How the hell are ya?
All right, you guys. This is Johnny Kovak.
Most of you guys know Joe Harper.
Joe Harper was
one of the first guys with this union.
Paying dues for more than 20 years.
Showing up in meetings.
Doing what he was asked.
Being a brother.
All his life he runs from one place
to another to support his family.
The only damn the company gave
about him was to have him run more,
till he run himself off the road.
Now the company
don't give a damn at all.
But I wanna tell you guys something.
We ain't asking the company for nothing,
cos we're gonna take care of Joe.
We're taking care of his doctor bills.
We're taking care of his family.
Cos Joe's a good union man.
And we're taking care of him
and the people he loves.
And I'll tell you something else.
You join this union,
we'll get you money for overtime
and doctor bills.
You won't have to kill yourself
making a buck, like you're doing now.
Like my old man did.
You join this union, you make it strong.
It'll make you strong.
And I swear, no company bastard
living up in the Heights
is gonna come down here
and walk all over your lives.
I promise you that.
Come on, Joe. Let's go.
Where do I sign?
Yeah. We're doing pretty good.
We're up this month.
Yeah. That brings it up to 300. And we'll
be up to about 400 by three or four weeks.
Oh, yeah. Abe is out right now.
Growing big, aren't we?
It's Abe's idea. We split the billboard up,
and explain exactly
what the "FIST" stands for.
Uh-huh. Yeah, listen, Abe is still out.
I'll get back to you in a minute, Mike.
Yeah, OK. Bye.
Mr Kovak, I'm Arthur St Clair, general
counsel for Consolidated Trucking.
I know who you are.
May I sit down?
It occurs to me, Mr Kovak,
that we have some concerns in common.
In different ways,
we're both concerned about truckers.
You for the union and... your commission.
And I'm concerned for the company
and our profits, of course.
Of course.
It's been brought to my attention,
Mr Kovak, that...
you have a special talent
for communicating with drivers.
- I'd like to put that talent to work.
- Uh-huh.
- How you gonna do that?
- By hiring you to work for us.
Think about it seriously, Mr Kovak.
Think of the good you can do from
inside the company, helping our drivers.
What about the men?
What about the union?
Your associate Mr Belkin could carry on
for you. Money, of course, is no problem.
We'll be happy to double whatever you're
making now in salary and commissions.
- It's not bad.
- Very "not bad", I'd say.
You know something, St Clair?
When I first took this job, I had
a feeling that if I did a good enough job,
somebody would come walking up
those stairs - somebody like you -
and they'd sit in that chair
and tell me what you're telling me now.
And I knew then what
I was gonna say, and I know now.
Why don't you get the hell outta my
office? You're stinking up union property.
As you get older, Kovak,
you'll find that civility can be learned...
sometimes even taught.
You change your mind, give me a call.
- Anna.
- What do you want?
What's the matter?
Are you crying? What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Did somebody do something to you?
- No.
- What's the matter?
- Don't you ever cry?
- I cry when I peel onions.
But you look like you're more upset
than that. Wanna grab some beer?
I told you, I don't drink beer.
How about some coffee?
No, you don't want no coffee.
How about ice cream?
Everybody likes ice cream.
What do you like? You like vanilla?
Chocolate? No chocolate?
How about strawberry?
I know you like strawberry.
I can see you smiling.
I know there's a smile in there.
There you go. Some strawberry?
I know a great place. Cheap, too.
Oh, no hands.
You mean you don't want me to touch
you. No hands? All right, no hands.
It's gonna be very difficult
driving with no hands.
But we'll work something out.
- Ever try to shift with your elbows?
- I've never been in a car.
Maybe by the end of the summer
we'll be up around 500.
The union is trying to make sure
no one gets stepped on,
because that's what
the problem's always been.
I was thinking that maybe
we ought to go see a show sometime.
At the factory where I work, two girls tried
to start a union, and they threw 'em out.
That's rough.
I read in the papers where they have
Ginger Rogers appearing nightly.
Down at the Orpheum.
You ever seen her dance?
No. And now they can't get a job
anywhere in this entire city.
That's rough.
Maybe I could talk to some people.
- Would you?
- Yeah.
The way you're eating that ice-cream
cone, you remind me of Ginger Rogers.
You do. Saturday night I'm free.
- I got plans.
- You got plans? Well, so do I.
Sunday night?
- I got plans.
- Sure got a lot of plans.
What do you think
you'll be doing next Easter?
- Are you always so pushy?
- Yeah. When I really want something.
Maybe I'll check my schedule. See if
I got a cancellation for next Saturday,
nine o'clock.
Strawberry girl, think you'll be available?
- No hands?
- No hands? I'll make you a deal.
What?
No hands, if I can have
this ice-cream cone. OK?
OK.
How you doing, Bob?
How's the wife treating you?
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Johnny.
A guy in a Consolidated truck wants
to talk to you. He might wanna sign up.
Thanks a lot. Watch out for
Myrtle's coffee. She's on the warpath.
- You want to see me?
- Yeah, about signing up.
Good. What's your name?
- Jack.
- Jack? Jack what?
Kovak? I wanna sign up, too.
Argh, God!
Argh!
Argh!
Come on and show
your cards or your buttons.
Show your cards or your buttons.
Tom, do you wanna close the doors back
there, so we can get the meeting started?
We have with us here tonight,
from Indianapolis,
a man you all know or heard about.
He's gonna swear in
all you new members.
A man who's a real legend
in the union movement.
Yeah. It's Henry Ford.
Come on, now, Tom, now.
Let's settle down, guys. Settle down.
Max Graham,
the national president of this union.
First, I want to thank Mike Monahan
for the fancy introduction.
I wanna talk to you guys about
something I been seeing every place I go.
Skirts!
Any of you real smart guys
wanna crack wise,
get the hell outta here and do it outside!
I don't wanna think the companies
sent you in here to disrupt this meeting.
What I wanna talk to you about
is this business of Bolshevik agitating.
- Have you come across any Bolsheviks?
- You know what I mean.
I seen 'em in Pittsburgh. I seen 'em in
Detroit. You got 'em here in Cleveland.
I wanna talk to you about
getting your dues in on time.
Pay your dues.
Johnny, how are you?
- Every bohunk in here know him?
- Yeah. Everybody likes Johnny.
Hey, Molly. He wants to go out with you.
- Who?
- The gentleman you like. Abe.
- She wants to go out with you.
- How do you know?
- If you don't, I will.
- Yeah, you would, too.
You're not a driver, are you, Kovak?
- Not like you guys, no.
- Didn't think so.
- Stirring these men up. Grandstanding.
- What grandstanding?
What are you talking?
We've grown since Johnny come in.
You mean he's grown. You make
a commission on each one?
Yeah. I do my job.
You making a name for yourself?
Putting money in your mattress?
He never even drove a truck!
- I'll see you guys later.
- Wait.
Pretty soon the company'll come along
and offer you something, and you'll take.
You'll take.
Come on, Abe. Johnny, come on back.
Have another beer.
- Jesus! I'm sorry, Molly.
- That's OK.
- I'm off Friday.
- You're on.
Did you like the movie?
No.
You didn't?
Just kidding you.
You're really a sucker, you know that?
Night, Abe.
Night, Molly.
Good night.
Argh!
- You guys saw what they did to Abe.
- Yeah!
We can't just go running out on
strike just because somebody got hurt.
I didn't join up to lose my job, Johnny.
Huh? Did we?
I don't want a strike
no more than you do, Tom.
I don't want nobody to lose jobs, none
of you. What are you getting from us?
- Nothing.
- Are they paying you overtime?
- No.
- Paying your doctor bills?
No.
All we've done so far is take your dues.
Look. Me and Mike are gonna go in there
and we're gonna talk to 'em.
- Ah, so that's Kovak.
- That's him.
How many of our drivers
has he signed up so far?
About 60 per cent.
- Go get 'em.
- Go get 'em, Johnny.
I know these foreigners around here.
They're good simple people.
They like to have a lot of laughs,
a few beers.
And don't take no crap!
- Hello. I'm Phillip Talbot.
- I'm Mike Monahan.
This is our organiser, Johnny Kovak.
My father should be here soon.
Sorry for the delay.
That's all right, Mr Talbot.
We got the time.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
- This is Mr St Clair, our attorney.
- We've met.
And Mr Langley, our comptroller.
We're gonna sit down there.
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen. Some of these
meetings, you know how they go on.
Why don't you move down here?
Perhaps we could hear each other better.
No, we can hear fine.
Unless you guys wanna come down here.
Oh, I think we can hear just fine.
Shall we begin?
This is Mr Monahan,
the president of the local, and Mr Novak.
Kovak. Chief organiser.
All right, Mr Kovak,
what can we do for you?
Mike is the president. I guess he knows
better than me, so lay it out for him, Mike.
Certainly. Mr Monahan?
The thing of it is, Mr Talbot, the men in
our local are upset about a few things,
and we wanted to talk 'em over with you.
I'm always willing to discuss our men's
problems. I want the men to be happy.
Well, the way the men see it,
the company ought to pay for
the medical bills when any guy gets hurt,
and set up some kind of
an insurance plan - for the family.
How do we stand on that?
Our policy's like the other companies'.
We don't have an insurance programme,
but, as you know, we have
on occasion lent some of the men money,
at standard rates,
for medical emergencies.
Some of the men have already expressed
their appreciation to me personally.
That's very nice.
I was thinking, Mr Talbot,
not of your lending them money,
but of paying the bills.
We're gonna cut 'em off, pal.
You know that?
- What did he say?
- I said, we're gonna cut 'em off.
Your balls.
And what exactly do you mean
by that crudity, Mr Kovak?
- I mean we're gonna shut you down.
- I see.
No, you don't see. You don't see nothing.
You guys don't hear nothing,
cos if you did we wouldn't be sitting here.
You're suffering from
small eyes and fat asses.
- Is he speaking for you, Mr Monahan?
- Johnny knows what the men want.
I think I've heard enough.
No, you haven't heard enough! If a guy
works overtime, why don't you pay him?
If he needs insurance, why don't you
give him it? We're not asking for charity.
We're not asking you to be generous,
just smart businessmen.
Ah, I see.
Well, the answer is no, Mr Kovak.
No insurance, no overtime, no pay raises.
Let's go, Mike.
You know how much money
you're gonna lose in a strike?
He's unbelievable.
- I wanna talk to you.
- Let go of me!
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you stand me up?
- Nobody comes for me drunk.
- I was under control.
- Whose control? The gentlemen...
- I ain't a gentleman.
The gentlemen who take me out,
they knock on my door very politely.
- Is that right?
- Yes. They talk to my mother.
- What am I gonna talk to her about?
- The weather.
- The weather?
- The weather!
They escort me to their car.
Sometimes they even bring me flowers.
- Flowers?
- Flowers.
You know, you're nuts.
You know that, Anna? You know that?
I look like I got any flowers?! Do you think
I'm a pansy? You think I got flowers?!
Are those for me?
My name is John Kovak. I have a date
with Anna. I'm looking for Anna's mother.
- I am Mrs Zerinkas. Come in, please.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Sit down. Yes.
What beautiful roses.
Thank you. They were having a sale,
so I thought I'd... buy 'em.
Maybe we should put them in a vase?
If it's OK with you,
I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand.
Yes. Just one moment, please.
Anna? Your friend is here.
I'll be down in a minute, Mamma.
- Uh, please.
- Thank you.
This heat is really something.
The humidity from the lake, I think.
I like it when it's cold because
you can feel yourself breathe.
And you don't sweat
through all your shirts.
This is one of the hottest spells
we have had in years.
That's very true. Very true.
I was thinking about that.
- You are not Lithuanian.
- No. I'm Hungarian.
Hm.
- Catholic?
- Oh, sure. Since I was born.
Ah!
What have you two
been talking about behind my back?
- The weather.
- Oh, Johnny!
What beautiful flowers.
You shouldn't have.
Well, they were having a sale,
so I thought "Well, why not?"
Thank you.
I just love it when it's
so nice and warm. Don't you, Johnny?
Yeah. I was saying...
I like it. It opens the pores.
Mr Kovak was just saying
how much he likes the cold.
Well, what I meant is, I like it both ways.
I like to be hot and cold
at the same time. It...
Guess I better be going.
- Well, have fun.
- Yes, I'll try.
- I'll have her back in about a month or so.
- Oh, I'm sure.
It was nice meeting you.
We'll have a good time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
Don't breathe.
I do great train imitations. I've been
doing it all my life, since I was a kid.
- Wanna hear a train?
- Sure.
Let me see.
Hey, Johnny! How you doing?
Hiya, Vince.
I was showing Anna my train imitation.
Oh, yeah? You always were
a bit of an engineer.
I see you won yourself a doll, too.
Anna, this is Vince Doyle, and Jocko.
I don't know the girls.
- This is Bonnie and Rosie.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
- You always knew how to pick 'em.
- Hey, Vince. How about it, all right?
- Sorry.
I hear you're taking your guys out.
You're a regular labour leader.
Regular labour leader?
Well, I'm just doing my job.
You're whistling past the graveyard, kid.
I think I'm doing the right thing.
Nobody's gonna break
that old man's back, not in this town.
We'll see.
- Well, we gotta go.
- OK.
Bye, doll.
Who is that man?
Oh, Vince? Vince works for the church.
- Really.
- No. He's just some guy I grew up with.
Vince never had
good manners like me. Hm?
Wanna go spend some dimes?
Wanna hear my train imitation?
Everybody gather round. I want bright boy
here to hear this so he knows the rules.
We're out on strike. That means there's
no trucks going in or coming out.
This is the boundary!
What did the police say?
They'll be arrested
if they destroy property.
I told you we'd be back, Talbot!
I told you we'd be back.
We're on strike! You can't win!
That damned Roosevelt. What this
country needs is Douglas MacArthur.
Hey, Jack. Rest of you guys
come on over here.
- Do you need a hand?
- What do you think?
Is that all right? Watch it, it's still wet.
Take these on over to Higgins.
OK, let's go. Lift it up. Watch it.
Don't tear that canvas. Thatta way. Good.
- Father, you know these fellers here.
- Hello, Father.
It's a three-ring circus. You said
it wouldn't even last a month, Arthur.
They can't hold out much longer, sir.
That bohunk's not gonna put
a circus tent on my doorstep.
Call the Law and Order League.
# Let's go down and join the union
# Let's go down and join right now
- How you holding up?
- Pretty good. And you?
I can go another eight hours.
Linda, you washed more cups.
I finally got you something to eat.
It's not much but go ahead.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Molly.
- There you go.
- There's a truck.
- There's a truck.
I want you to pull against them.
- Looks like they got guns.
- Hold it.
# So let's go down and join the union
Hey! Look out!
Look out! Get out the way!
Get back. That way. Go now!
What you're doing is illegal!
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
- Johnny, they're burning the tent.
- It's on fire!
Damn you, Talbot!
You and your lousy scabs!
- Johnny!
- Come on!
You goddamn bastards!
You goddamn bastards!
Get out of the way!
Get outta the way! You damn butchers!
Mike?
Butchers! Damn you to hell, Talbot!
Mike!
Ah, Christ!
Did I do this?
Is this my fault? This is my fault.
- I'm sure it's my fault.
- No.
You know, Monahan and my old man,
they used to tie one on
at Cassidy's... every Saturday.
Whistling past the graveyard,
isn't that what I said?
We're all in it now, Vince.
It's got nothing to do with me.
- Yeah. What's in it for you?
- That's right. What's in it for me?
And let me ask you something. What
the hell is in it for you? Get off it, Johnny.
People we buried are our people.
My people's anybody who pays.
They're our people!
Johnny, what you need is real push.
Real push is what I got.
I need it now.
Well, that's gonna cost you.
We got a fund.
Well... I'll see what I can do.
OK.
- Thanks.
- It's about time you wised up.
- I'll see you, kid.
- Goodbye.
Don't do it, Johnny.
Wanna keep burying people?
Bring Vince and his crowd in,
they'll screw up this union.
- They won't be in for life.
- Vince comes, he'll never get out.
- Without help we ain't got a union.
- We can do it!
- We need push.
- And how are we gonna know?
- Know what?
- The difference.
What difference?
Between them and us.
We got trouble here.
I'm gonna straighten things out.
Hi, Johnny.
- You know Vince.
- Long time.
How you doing?
Graham's talking against the strike.
- Let me talk to him.
- What the hell's gonna happen next?
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
What are you gonna tell these men now?
I'm glad you came down, Max.
Talbot's gonna meet with me tomorrow.
You took these men out,
I'm getting their jobs back.
Let's talk.
I need your help on something, Max.
Yeah, I'll bet you do.
I'll see you men in a couple of minutes.
We'll be back.
You should have asked for my help
before you started all this.
I can't argue about that.
What's on your mind?
- What is this?
- Get the door.
What is this?
You're going to see Talbot?
That's right, Kovak.
You're gonna sell us out, Max, aren't you?
Make us go back for nothing. Aren't you?
I don't have to talk to you.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I discussed this with the men.
Train leaves in an hour.
You're going back to Indianapolis.
Like hell I am!
You crazy?!
I'm the president of this union!
No, Max. You're a salesman.
- You'll sell us out.
- You son of a bitch.
You're gonna sell us out, make us go back
for nothing. But this is our fight, our strike.
This is our local. It belongs to us.
You're out of it.
All right.
You do it your way.
You wanna stand alone?
I'll see you at the next funeral.
Let's go.
Settle down! You guys without any seats,
stand along the sides.
You guys got seats, sit down,
we can get outta this sweatbox.
Order! Thank you.
I just wanna say before we get started
that Max Graham got called back
to Indianapolis on sudden business,
but he wanted me to tell you
that he's with us 200 per cent.
We're gonna go back out there.
They're not gonna beat us down no more.
They're not gonna burn us down no more.
They're not gonna
shoot us down no more.
Cos if they do,
we're gonna do what Mike did.
We're coming at 'em
with everything we got.
And I'm saying to Consolidated right now,
we gotta do any more
burying in the graveyard,
they better get out their shovels
cos we're through taking punches.
You don't win a fight taking a punch!
Nobody ever won a fight taking a punch!
You see what this says? This ain't
a bunch of letters like any other union.
It says FIST! And that's what we are.
Every guy in here, a fist. One fist!
One fist!
One fist! What are you?
- FIST!
- What are you?
FIST! FIST! FIST! FIST!
OK, kid. Go ride your bike.
Vinnie? A Consolidated truck,
just going over the bridge.
OK. Al, Lefty, Lard, go pay 'em a call.
Don't overdo it. Yeah.
Yeah. OK. Thank you.
We got another one. Just left terminal
warehouse. You and Chuck, go get him.
Keep those guys back there. Keep 'em
back. Lotta space between 'em, boys.
Hey, scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!
- What are we?
- FIST!
- What are we?
- FIST!
Hiya, Hank. How's the wife and kids?
- What are we?
- FIST!
FIST! FIST! FIST! FIST! FIST!
Car 47 to Cleveland PD. Need assistance
at front gate, Consolidated. Over.
Hold it. Hold it!
Anything wrong?
Hey, Vince! Here they come!
It's time.
It's time!
Slow down. Hold it here.
Come on!
