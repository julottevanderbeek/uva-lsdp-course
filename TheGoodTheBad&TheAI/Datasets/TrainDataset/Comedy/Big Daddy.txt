SONNY: Hello?
MR. KOUFAX: Sonny, it's your dad.
You asleep?
SONNY: No. Hey, man.
I was exercising.
Bullshit. You were sleeping.
No, I wasn't. I wasn't.
This kid won't stop lying to me.
You still act like you're 6.
SONNY:
Oh, yeah, okay, Dad. I act like I'm 6.
MR. KOUFAX:
Any luck finding a job where you can
work more than one day a week?
SONNY:
Uh, I've been looking.
MR. KOUFAX:
Looking doesn't pay the rent, kid.
SONNY:
Hey, all the money I won
from the cab accident
is kicking ass
in the stock market, so relax.
MR. KOUFAX:
Yeah, well, don't blow it
all on worthless crap.
SONNY:
I won't.
MR. KOUFAX:
You know what you should
spend it on? Your bar exam.
SONNY:
You're the lawyer in the family.
I ain't taking a damn bar exam.
I got too much other shit
going on in my life.
MR. KOUFAX:
I don't know what the hell
happened to you.
SONNY: Okay.
MR KOUFAX: Anyway.
How are things going
with your girlfriend,
what's-her-name, Vanessa?
Things are going fine.
Shit!
I gotta... I gotta go.
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.
SONNY: No, no, no!
I mean, yes, I did, but I thought
you needed more sleep, Vanessa.
I knew I shouldn't
have stayed here.
That was a real jerk
thing to do. Thanks a lot.
What are you doing? Why are
you going to work? It's Sunday.
I'm not going to work.
I'm going to brunch with
some potential clients.
That's how a party planner gets
business, by meeting people
and making contacts.
Meet with me. Come on, I'll order
in from Cozy's. We'll have fun.
I am sick of Cozy's. You order
in from there all the time.
The delivery guy's
like your best friend.
Well, he happens to be
pretty damn nice.
This is a rough patch
in my life right now.
Syracuse is 0 and 3.
And I got those
medical problems.
Medical problems?
A cab runs over your foot
two years ago. You spend
one night in the hospital.
First of all, that cab was huge.
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.
So there you go.
Whatever.
What the hell's the matter?
Why are you being so nuts
to me lately?
Because you refuse to move on
to the next phase of your life.
I, on the other hand, would like
to have a family someday.
But I need someone that I can
rely on, not just a playmate.
What, you need a father figure?
"Stop pulling your sister's hair!"
You know what? I'm gonna go
to Syracuse to see my mom.
I'll be back on Wednesday.
What are you talking about?
I had call for delivery in building,
but I think it was crank call.
You want some chocolate cake?
It's a bad time, man.
Come back later.
I'll Indian wrestle you.
You're going down,
sucker.
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.
Okay. Peace, out.
What do you mean
you're going to Syracuse?
Because I need time to think
and so do you.
What do I need to think about?
Your life and why there's
any reason for me to be a part of it.
All right.
While you're at it,
why don't you think about
getting a real job?
I got a real job!
"ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.
Hey, Sonny.
What's up, buddy boy?
I'm out the door. Hey, pal.
Where you going?
Manhattan.
Manhattan?
You wanna take me with you?
All right, I guess.
All right, hold on to your money.
Later on, pal.
Okay, take care, Sonny.
See you.
SONNY:
Cadillac, I love it.
ALL:
Surprise!
CORINNE:
Just ignore him.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's only Sonny. It's only Sonny.
Yeah, it's only me. It's only me.
What's going on?
Corinne's throwing a surprise
going-away party for Kevin.
Why didn't she
tell me about it?
The roommate has
a right to know.
Because she knew you'd
tell him and ruin the surprise.
No, I wouldn't.
Hey, surprise.
ALL:
Surprise.
Surprise.
Surprise.
What's going on?
We wasted the good
surprise on you.
All right.
Is this your handiwork?
I guess.
See you in three hours.
Good to see you
stiffs out anyways.
What've you been doing?
Last three weeks have been
crazy at work, man. I've been in
Denver, Dallas, San Francisco...
I've been sleeping
in the office.
We're going to trial on this
securities fraud case.
Honey, it was a great surprise.
I was totally shocked.
CORINNE: No, you weren't!
And I worked so hard on this.
Need some help?
Honey, your sister's here.
Hey, sweetie.
CORINNE:
I hate Sonny.
So my client's out 7 million bucks,
and all we can sue on is breach
of contract.
Maybe you can try suing under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
I gotta get back to the office.
Sonny, you're the king.
Right on.
Mikey, a pleasure.
I'll see you at home.
All right.
I'll walk you out.
Okay.
I gotta admit, I'm still a little
weirded out when they kiss.
Why? They're gay.
That's what gay guys do.
Yeah, I know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?
Remember when Dad had
that huge barbecue
for all his work friends
and then it rained,
so he and Mom had to go into
the kitchen and make
like a hundred hamburgers
with one frying pan?
CORINNE:
Yeah.
Well, you're not gonna let
a little rain stop you from making
a hundred hamburgers, are you?
"DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT"
That relationship's
lasted a lot longer
than I thought it would.
Look at his eyes though.
He's bored out of his mind.
I give it two more weeks.
Hey, excuse me.
Everybody! Hey!
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank you
all for coming tonight.
Uh, or I guess I should say:
I'm getting it. Tomorrow
I'm leaving for China
to represent the fine firm
of Morton and Mandel.
Yes, me, the same guy who once
shaved his ass to win a $5 bet.
Prove it!
Just kidding.
But I am real glad
you're all here tonight,
because I'm about to do
something that I never thought
I'd have the guts to do.
You're not proposing,
are you?
Uh, yeah, pal, I am.
Well, think about it,
you know?
God, Sonny, shut up!
Anyway, uh, will you?
Yeah.
Good call on the two weeks, pal.
Hey, Sonny,
what was that all about?
Hey, congratulations.
You and Big Boobs McGee
are gonna be real happy.
Don't call her Big Boobs McGee.
You wanna explain to your children
you met their mother while she was
waitressing at Hooters?
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now,
and my fianc√©e,
so from now on,
Dr. Big Boobs McGee.
Congratulations.
Thanks, man.
I just, uh,
got shit going on.
What's the matter?
Vanessa's gonna
break up with me
and I don't know what to do
to make her wanna stay.
Vanessa's just getting older.
She wants different things,
you know?
Career, stable relationship,
a family.
That's how they get.
I just want things to go back
to the way they used to be.
Like when we were at Syracuse.
Yeah.
And Vanessa worshiped you.
Yes. That was nice.
Nobody was hassling you
to get a job.
Tommy and Phil were
showering separately.
Those were the days.
What are you doing?
If I make this putt,
Vanessa will realize
she likes me the way I am.
Oh, you're going to the putt.
Remember, the roof
breaks to the right.
Yes! That's what I'm talk...
Good God!
That can't be good.
Where's Kevin?
Oh, he already left. I guess
he forgot to say goodbye to you.
Why are you here then?
I'm cleaning
because you're useless.
And then what, you gonna go
to your Hooters reunion?
You guys can sit around,
talk about whose ass hangs
out of their shorts the most?
At least I can fit my ass
into my shorts, fatty.
Speaking of fatty,
whose is this?
I don't know.
I'm eating it then.
"We wasted the good
surprise on you."
Yeah?
Lady gave me $5
to bring him over here.
What do you mean?
Later.
What, are you selling
raffle tickets or something?
Oh, boy.
Kevin Gerrity.
SONNY: It's me.
I got something to tell you.
Yeah, what's up?
There's a kid here.
Uh, what kind of kid?
Uh, if this note is true,
it's your kid.
What are you talking about?
Um, I'm having a tough time
reading this,
but I think it says, "Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son.
I hope you understand why
I didn't tell you about him until now,
but he needs your help.
I can't be his mother anymore."
This is ridiculous.
Wait, hang on.
Who's this?
This is my friend.
Is that Kevin on the phone?
No, it's my Uncle Remus.
Hi. What's your name?
Is he all right?
Yeah, he just doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.
You're such a dick.
That was your girlfriend.
She was acting really
"Hooterific" again.
Who sent that note?
"Jan."
Jan... I don't know any Jan.
Where's he from?
Where are you from, buddy?
Buffalo.
Buffalo. I've never
even been to Buffalo.
Somebody's messing with me.
Maybe it's a mistake.
Is there really a kid there?
Or is this like the time you
said my parents were dead?
I swear to God, he's right here.
I'm coming home, all right?
I don't know how I'm gonna
explain this to the partners...
No, no, no. Hang on.
It says here, "If you won't
take responsibility for him,
they found a foster family..."
Yes, Uncle Remus,
I know the catfish are huge.
That's terrific.
Here's a number for a guy
at City Social Service Bureau.
Arthur Brooks. I'll call him.
I better come home.
No, no, no. Let me take care of it.
You sure you can take care of this?
Yeah, I'll be fine, don't worry.
Hooters. Hooters.
Hooters!
All right, listen, Sonny. Thanks a lot.
Yeah, later.
Well, I'm gonna make
another phone call.
You want to come
and sit down, pal?
Or you can stand there.
Anything you want.
I'll be a minute.
BROOKS :
Social Service office
is closed today, Columbus Day.
We'll be open tomorrow
morning at 8 a.m.
Columbus Day.
Boy, I don't know
what to tell you, pal.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.
Can you be a tough
little guy until then?
Great.
Hey, do I need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?
No.
What do you eat?
Food.
Yeah? I eat food too.
What? Come on.
You need me
to hold your hand?
What I like to do
on Monday afternoons
is go to Central Park and watch
the rollerbladers fall down.
You into that?
I don't know.
SONNY:
Watch. This guy's humming.
Ooh, ooh, ooh. He's going down,
he's going down, he's going!
How old are you,
anyways?
Five.
Five?
You wear a diaper?
No.
You wipe your own ass then?
Yes.
You do? Good job.
That's cool.
Come on, fall down.
Fall down. Yes!
Oh, come on, damn it.
You suck. You suck.
You suck!
Check this out.
SONNY:
My God!
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.
All right, now what way
would you put that on?
This Columbo,
he pretends to be stupid,
but he's really
smart as a tack.
Oh, yeah,
he is.
You put the vane on down there.
Then this boat comes up.
I wipe my own ass.
Me too.
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?
Scuba Steve.
I like his flippers.
Does he ever take them off?
No.
How about if he goes bowling?
They don't make him wear
bowling shoes? They let him
wear the flippers?
Yes.
Really?
I had a doll like that
at one time.
But my cat,
he bite his head off.
What kind of cat
would do that?
You calling me a liar?
Hey, take it easy.
Anyways, Monday Night Football
is tonight. Jets are playing.
We're gonna go to
the Blarney Stone, okay?
You wanna come with us?
I've got more deliveries
on the bicycle.
Well, maybe you can also
finish the turkey on your lip.
Right there.
SONNY:
Yeah, let's crank up the Styx.
No music during the game.
It's halftime.
Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
Goddamn Jets.
What are you doing
in here, cutie?
Watching football.
Who do you want to win?
The goddamn Jets.
Have fun.
AROUND AND FELL IN LOVE"
Hey, too bad you don't like girls.
I think you could've had her.
I'm thirsty.
You're thirsty?
What do you want, a soda?
Are you allowed soda?
I don't know.
My mother always said
that soda rots your teeth,
but you're gonna lose them
teeth anyway, so rot on, right?
Can we get two root beers, please?
Sure.
Man, when I graduated law school,
we used to meet here every Monday
night to watch football.
Who would meet you?
My friends, Vanessa.
Vanessa always used
to root against the team
I wanted to win
just to bust my chops.
But everybody's so busy with their
crap lately, no one ever comes.
Like I'm not busy?
Hey, Mr. Herlihy, how about you
shut up or I'll smack you through
the wall like last Monday?
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.
Anytime.
He drinks a lot of soda.
I'm telling you, buddy.
Vanessa, she's the one.
I can't lose her.
I'm not getting any handsomer,
I know that.
Every day I get a little bit older
and balder and fatter.
Fatter?
Yeah.
When I was your age,
I could eat anything I wanted.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.
Now, I have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for like a week.
Enjoy the metabolism
while you got it.
Metalobism?
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.
Anyways, I had fun today.
Did you have fun?
Yeah, you're all right.
Have a good one.
Sonny?
Yes?
Could I have a night-light?
Night-light? I think I can
help you out. Hang on.
Let's see here.
There you go, all right?
Sonny?
Are you my dad?
Oh, ah...
No, I'm not,
but that whole Dad and Mom thing
we'll figure out in the morning, okay?
You just go to sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
Go get the can,
okay?
Go! Go! Go!
I'm thinking about
keeping the kid.
Sonny. Remember that time
you went with me to the
pet store to get fish food
and you saw that cute little puppy
and you wanted to get it, but then
I reminded you about feeding it
and cleaning it
and toilet training it?
Yeah.
Well, this is kind of like that,
except with a human.
I mean, I'm glad you had
fun and all, but this is big.
I gotta do something big with my life.
I think Vanessa will respect that.
So you're thinking that since
sometimes women get pregnant
to try to fix a troubled relationship,
why can't a guy adopt a kid
to do the same thing?
I didn't think of it like that.
But, yeah, that's a good point.
Yes, that's what I'm thinking.
Sounds nuts
to me, pal.
Do yourself a favor.
Sleep on it.
You're right. Can I borrow
your cell phone for a minute?
Thank you.
Hello. Arthur Brooks speaking.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, how you doing?
Kevin Gerrity here.
Ah, right on, Mr. Gerrity.
We were expecting your call.
Yeah, I was wondering,
do you still got a foster family
lined up for Julian?
Yes, we do.
Well, you can cancel them.
I've decided to take care
of the little guy.
Way to sleep
on it, pal.
Hey, you two want to get
married, I support that.
Leave me alone.
When natural parents take
the responsibility, I mean, there's
absolutely no bigger high for us.
I'm psyched about it too, buddy.
So I guess that's it.
Yep, that's it. And good luck
to you and your son.
My son.
MAN:
Goddamn stick!
That's my boy.
Hey.
Hi.
Go back to sleep, all right?
Well, I'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.
I wet my bed.
Oh?
Oh, God.
That's a shitload of piss.
Okay.
There you go,
all right?
No more wet mess.
Sleep, all right?
Just try to sleep. Stay asleep.
No.
Sit still!
Lay!
All right! I'm up!
It smells like urine
in this joint. Good job.
What are you
doing there, boy?
Making cereal.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
pour me a bowl?
Or don't pour me a bowl.
Either way.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Hey, hey, hey.
We can fix this.
Hey.
It's not a big deal.
Look. See?
See how quick it goes away?
Crybaby, come on.
Don't worry about it, boy.
Ow!
Scuba Steve,
damn you!
You like that? You think
that's funny, me getting hurt?
Ha, ha.
There's a bright side to
being up before 11: We can
catch McDonald's breakfast.
I haven't been up in time
for that in like 10 years.
You wanna do that?
Tie your shoes, we'll go.
Hurry though.
It's like 12 blocks
from here, so tie quickly.
Do you need help with that?
I can do it.
Let me do it.
All right. You loop it,
you swoop it, and you pull.
You loop it,
you swoop it, you pull.
Good, good. All right, let's go.
We're in a hurry.
SONNY:
See, it's different
for your generation.
You guys have always had
the McDonald's breakfast
available to you.
JULIAN:
I have?
SONNY: Yeah, yeah.
When I was born, all we had
were the burgers and fries.
Maybe the fish sandwich.
I'm not sure. I gotta
get back to you on that.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.
I remember my dad took us
to McDonald's the very first
morning they had breakfast.
Everybody was baffled
in the place.
They were like,
"Are these sausages or
are these hamburgers?"
I have to go
to the bathroom.
You what? We're gonna
be there in a minute.
I gotta go now.
Hey, didn't you pee enough
in bed already?
We only got nine minutes
to get there.
But I gotta go to the bathroom.
All right, let's go.
Hey, buddy, can my kid use
the bathroom for a minute?
Customers only.
Oh, yeah, he's just a kid.
Come on, we'll be in and out.
It's not my problem.
It's not your problem?
All right.
Come on.
Here you are. Your waiter
will be right with you.
I can't do it.
What do you mean, you can't do it?
You said you gotta go. Just go.
I'm scared.
Could you do it too?
All right.
Here we go.
And we're off.
That's not too difficult, right?
And we're both
losing weight.
Good job. All right,
we're gonna miss
breakfast. Let's go.
Put it away. Yeah.
Hey. Thanks, anyways.
Sure thing. Anytime.
SONNY: Come on.
Move your ass there, pee-boy.
We only got five minutes,
five minutes. Now four.
Come on. We're almost there.
We're almost there.
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?
This is where I live, little man.
We gotta get going, pal.
Why?
Well, in retrospect,
I made some really bad
choices after high school.
Yeah. We gotta get going, buddy.
Why?
Well, this was during
the so-called Disco Era,
but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.
Okay. We're gonna miss breakfast.
Why?
I never really thought
about that, kid.
I mean, I was never
Mr. Popularity in high school,
and I watched Fantasia a lot.
And one day it just clicked.
SONNY: Hey, yappy.
If you end the conversation,
I'll get you an Egg McMuffin.
How about a Sausage McMuffin
with hash browns?
You got a deal.
Look, look, look. He fell asleep.
He fell asleep. Let's go.
Let's go.
Sausage McMuffin.
Pardon me, sir. Sorry.
Hey. How you doing?
Welcome to McDonald's.
What can I get for you?
Okay, what do you want?
Cheerios.
Cheerios. They don't got
Cheerios. What else?
Lasagna.
Lasagna? What the hell's
the matter with you?
We'll take hotcakes
and sausage.
Sorry, sir. We stopped
serving breakfast.
What are you talking about?
We're four seconds late.
No, you're 30 minutes and four
seconds late. We stop serving
breakfast at 10:30.
Ah, horseshit!
No, no, no. Don't cry.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't cursing at you,
I was cursing at the lady.
Nice parenting.
Hey, thanks. Are you my
therapist? Take a walk.
Do you want a Happy Meal?
We'll get you one.
You got a Happy Meal?
Can we get a Happy Meal?
Will somebody get
the kid a Happy Meal?!
Relax.
Hey, where's my
Egg McMuffin?
Breakfast is over
at 10:30.
Really?
Yeah.
I thought it was 11.
I thought that too.
Total mind blower.
Will you just relax? Here.
What do you want me to do?
What would cheer you up?
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
She's nice. You'll like her.
You wanna see me get hurt?
Will that cheer you up some?
All right.
You like that, huh?
You think that's funny?
Good. No more crying.
Are you okay, man?
Next time, kill me.
Let's do it, Rangers.
ANNOUNCER :
- New York Rangers against
the Tampa Bay Lightning.
And at this stage
of the season,
it's as close as you can get
to a must-win game for the Rangers.
Otherwise they'll fall behind...
How you doing?
How you doing?
You like hockey?
You like hockey?
This is a big, important game.
Cut the crap.
Cut the crap.
I'm being serious.
Don't do that.
How much wood
would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Shut up.
Hey, don't you take naps?
Sometimes.
Well, why don't you
go take a nap?
I'm too hungry to sleep.
You want some food?
Having a kid is great,
as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.
ANNOUNCER:
He's taken down! Penalty shot!
Hey, how you doing there, boy?
You sleepwalking? Huh?
Why don't you go
back sleepy? Sleepy.
Keep napping. What's this?
Kangaroo song.
All right, great. That's terrific.
And we're gonna watch this
after the game, okay?
But after my nap, I always
watch the kangaroo song.
It's overtime right now, and there's
a penalty shot about to take place.
This happens like
once every 10 years...
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!
Kangaroo song! Kangaroo song!
All right!
God! You were
normal yesterday.
KANGAROO :
I can't take this shit.
Are you serious?
KANGAROO :
Come and play
KANGAROO & KIDS :
What do you say?
Douche-bag kangaroo.
What happened there?
Are you all hopped out?
All right, I don't know how
to deal with this. Hopefully
Vanessa will.
I think she's back.
If she's not back,
we'll wait for her.
Jeez. Come on,
get your coat. Clean up.
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?
No.
Do you swear?
I swear.
How come
you're not going?
Because I don't have to go.
Only you and my grandfather
go every 30 seconds.
Let's hurry it up, all right?
I'm keeping you company.
Hi!
What's your name? He'll write it
on the wall. Mind your business.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Why do I need to meet this lady?
Hey, now it is your problem.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
This is that lady I was
telling you about.
She's gonna be a big part
of your life from now on.
I'm scared.
What if she's not nice?
Look.
See these right here? These are
magic sunglasses, okay?
If you're afraid, you put them on,
they make you invisible.
Really? Nobody can see me?
Put them on.
Julian? Julian!
Hello, Julian?
Hey, Sonny,
I'm right here.
Oh, the glasses.
I couldn't see you.
Now, you keep those on
and no one can notice you
until you decide they can, okay?
Okay.
All right, let's go.
Julian? Julian?
I'm still right here.
Oh, okay, all right,
the glasses.
SONNY: Hey.
Hi.
Welcome back.
Who's that?
Who's who?
He's invisible.
Can I come in?
Sure.
Hey, any invisible people
out here,
feel free to come in, okay?
Sonny, I don't really know
what's going on right now,
but we should sit down and talk...
You know you said
I got some thinking to do?
So I did it.
Just because I don't have a job
doesn't mean I don't wanna
move on to the next level.
And instead of just saying
that to you, I figured
I would show you.
Before you say anything else,
I just want you to know...
Look at that. He took
his sunglasses off.
He wants you to see him.
That means he likes you.
Julian, come here.
Come here, pal.
Vanessa,
I want you to meet
Julian, my son.
Our son. I adopted him.
I don't know what to say.
You don't have to
say anything.
Uh... Heh-heh.
Is somebody in the bathroom?
No.
Why is the door shut?
I don't know.
You don't?
Mm-mm.
I don't know.
VANESSA: Sonny.
I can't believe this.
Hey. Open up.
Sonny.
Hello. Open the door!
VANESSA:
Sonny.
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God.
Man, I'm sorry.
I was freaking out there.
I'm Sonny.
Sid.
Hey, Sid. I had an attack
of paranoia. I thought you
were sleeping with my girl.
I am.
What's that?
I am.
Sonny, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
I found someone.
This old guy?
Sid.
He's already achieved
so much,
and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.
And he has
a five-year plan.
What is it? "Don't die"?
I can't believe this shit.
We got a family now.
I thought this is what
you wanted.
Sonny, you surprising me with a kid
that you adopted while I was away
wasn't what I said I wanted.
SONNY:
I did this for you.
You wanted me
to be more responsible.
I can't raise this kid alone.
You know, you remind me
of my oldest grandson.
You don't think things through.
Hey, Old Man River,
zip it or I'll break your hip.
I'd like to see you try it.
Shut up, Sid.
How could you misconstrue
the situation so badly?
I don't know.
Come on.
Deep down you must've known
this day was gonna come.
Hey. You just made the biggest
mistake of your life, baby.
I know you're gonna be
missing me when you got
that big, white, wrinkly
body on top of you,
with his loose skin
and old balls.
Gross. Ugh.
Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.
Hey, I got an emergency
problem with this kid here.
Is Arthur Brooks around?
Yeah, I'll go get him for you.
Can you sit over there for a while?
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.
Mr. Gerrity?
Hi. Arthur Brooks.
How are you?
I need to speak with you.
I didn't tell you to come down
to the office, did I?
Because I was
gonna send you the final
paperwork in the mail, man.
It's like the opposite of that.
Look, I can't manage
this kid.
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.
Mistake?
I had a mother lined up for him,
but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.
The kid just won't stop
peeing and throwing up.
He's like a cocker spaniel.
I just...
I think he'd be better off
with his natural mother.
Well, she passed away
last night, Mr. Gerrity.
She had cancer. She must
have sensed that, like,
her time was running short
and that she wanted her son
to be with the natural father.
It makes sense.
Loop.
Pull.
Look, if you don't wanna
take care of Julian,
we'll take him. But I gotta tell you,
man, he's gonna have to chill
for a while in a group home.
Group home? What is that,
like an orphanage?
Yeah. We don't call
them that anymore.
JULIAN:
Hey, hey!
Look, I did it.
Loop, swoop and pull.
Jeez, you did do it.
Congratulations, kid.
I showed him that.
Why don't you
go back over there, okay?
BROOKS:
I'll call the Heatherton Home...
No, why don't we do this?
Temporarily I'll hang on to the kid
until you find him a new family.
Oh, I don't know, man.
I mean, I gotta watch out for
the best interest of the kid.
You said yourself you
were a bogus dad.
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.
I don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.
Why don't we pretend that you didn't
even come in here today, okay?
And I'll give you a shout
when I line up a family, all right?
That's good. Okay.
Later.
Just don't make me regret this.
Where are we
going now?
I gotta make a phone call.
Just stay right here, all right?
Hello?
OPERATOR:
This is a collect call from:
SONNY:
Your baby boy.
OPERATOR:
To accept charges, say, "Yes."
Yeah, I'll accept.
Hey, Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?
Not too bad.
Your mother got a sunburn
playing tennis yesterday.
I got some
interesting news.
Oh, yeah? What?
Kind of adopted a kid.
What the hell
are you talking about?
I'm talking about you being
a grandfather. Congratulations.
Who the hell would give you a kid?
Social Services.
You idiot. You better give
that kid back.
His mother's...
Hang on. Hang on.
Go play with them
pigeons, buddy.
I tried to give him back.
I just can't, Dad. All right?
Look, I need your help.
I'm in a bad way right now.
Vanessa dumped me.
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing.
You're damn right you don't know
what the hell you're doing.
The kid is always around.
The past three days,
he just never leaves me alone.
You would think he'd want
some privacy, but he doesn't.
I'm in deep shit.
Just give that kid back
before you ruin both your lives.
Oh, I appreciate that, Dad.
He'd be better off living in
a dumpster than living with you.
I'll be a better father than you!
That's impossible! Because
all you care about is yourself!
Yeah? No, I care about you
saving money on this phone call!
Let's eat.
SONNY:
The Vanessa thing did not work out.
She lost her damn mind.
That wasn't your fault,
though, okay?
JULIAN:
Okay.
I know when you first got here
you thought you were gonna
meet your dad, but, pal,
I gotta tell you, I don't think
that's gonna happen.
Why?
I don't know why.
But, buddy, real dads aren't
always that great, you know.
I got a real dad
and the guy's out of his mind.
He's been telling me what to do
my whole life. He never lets me
figure stuff out on my own.
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why so many people
grow up nuts.
Look at this guy
over here.
He was probably
a nice boy just like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.
Now look at him.
Hey, buddy.
Who won the Jets game?
Who cares?
Let it go, pal. He can't
control you anymore.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, you're a loser.
You're mad at your dad,
not at me! I forgive you!
I am. I am.
I hate my father.
See, I don't want it to be like that.
I don't wanna control you, Julian.
You even like that name,
Julian?
I guess.
You guess? Well, shouldn't
you like your own name?
Why don't you pick your name?
It's gonna be your name
the rest of your life.
What do you want it to be?
Frankenstein.
Frankenstein? All right.
I can deal with that.
I'll call you Frankenstein.
What are you doing, Frankenstein?
You gonna play in the puddle?
Well, go ahead. Puddle it up.
From now on, you do
whatever you wanna do.
And I'll show you some
cool shit along the way.
That's what it's all about.
SONNY:
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.
Here we go.
It's coming right at you.
Okay. All right.
You're kind of picking your
head up, buddy. Don't do that.
Is this okay?
That's what you wanna wear?
That's okay with me then.
Good luck walking down
the street, that's all I can say.
Way to block it.
Now stay with it.
You're the next Willie Randolph.
Remember that.
There was this guy
Chief Jay Strongbow who
used to do a sleeper hold.
Put your arm
under here.
Lift this arm, okay?
Slide under and try
to lock wrists, okay?
Lock wrists. You're gonna...
Let me show you. Watch.
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back and boom!
Get him. Get him.
Lock him up. Lock him up.
Lock wrists. Okay?
You bring him down slow. Slow.
Apply pressure.
And he's going to sleep
right now.
See, he's out.
Nazo.
Wake up.
SONNY:
You'll be the only kid your age
with a slingshot, I promise.
Go have some fun.
Shoot a few beer cans or
something like that, all right?
You like that?
Sonny, Sonny, come here!
What is it? What's the matter?
Let me have that.
Go to your room. I think.
Or do whatever you want.
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?
No? You're excited, aren't you?
Let's go. Up, up, up.
Okay. Here comes some candy.
Hey, how you doing?
Happy Halloween!
We got a first-timer out here.
Do the right thing, buddy.
We want some candy!
Hang on right here for a second,
all right? Don't move.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, CDs. You like that?
Yeah. He's not happy.
What else you got?
Okay, yeah, that's good.
Trick-or-treat.
Say, "Happy Halloween."
Happy Halloween.
Thank you.
Next year,
be prepared, moron.
What's with the kid
wearing a cummerbund?
I let him wear whatever
he wants to wear.
Those boots
are the best.
Whose are they?
I know, right?
I think they're Kevin's.
I'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.
Frankenstein,
what do you want?
Thirty packets of ketchup.
All right. Thirty packets
of ketchup.
Ow! Hey.
SONNY:
Nice cut, pal.
SONNY:
Frankenstein.
Do that thing I taught you
the other day.
That's cool.
It took him like 20 minutes
to learn that, man.
He's quick. He's smart.
TOMMY: And he loves ketchup.
Yeah, he does.
This is like a whole
new school of child
raising I'm doing.
You give the kid options
instead of orders.
You know, let him make
the right decision.
You're a pioneer.
Thanks.
So you two just chill out
together all day?
Basically. Went to
the park yesterday.
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.
Eight? I can't even do one
with these scrawny arms.
They're not scrawny.
They're nice.
So, Julian, what do you
wanna do tomorrow?
I wanna go to school.
Look at that. I don't force him,
he makes the right decision.
Way to go, kid.
We'll enroll you on Monday, all right?
Let's just enjoy the weekend.
Do the thing again.
That one touched the ground.
That one touched the ground.
That was awesome!
TOMMY:
Good job.
Help me! Help me!
Hey, hey, shh.
Please help me.
I don't know where I live.
This isn't a big problem.
We'll just, um...
We'll find your parents.
What's your name?
Frankenstein.
Frankenstein. Okay.
SONNY: There you are.
There you are.
Are you okay, buddy?
I turned my head for one second
and he disappeared.
Don't you ever do that to me
again, okay? Don't do that.
Thank you so much for being
sweet to my little boy here.
You're welcome, Sonny.
Sonny?
I think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.
Your sister's Corinne?
That sucks.
Yeah, I'm up from D.C.
I was at that party,
the one where we wasted
the good surprise on you.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.
So, what, you have a son now?
I'm not really his dad.
I'm more of a temporary
father-figure type
until Social Services can get
another family for him.
At which point,
you'll have to find a new way
to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.
Yeah, that's correct.
Mm-hm.
Hey! Hey!
Good job, buddy!
He's peeing on his own.
Keep it flowing! That's it!
Go! Go!
So, um, does Corinne's
sister have a name?
It's Layla.
Layla?
Mm-hm.
I like your song.
Could you do me
a big favor?
Could you just hang out
with me tonight?
I don't want the kid to think
he's a failure because he
couldn't get me a date.
I really can't.
No?
No, I just have a ton
of work to do.
I see. Hang on a second.
Come here.
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight,
there's a good chance
that I'll develop a stutter.
P-P-P-Please
don't do this to me.
That is so cheap.
What?
"IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU"
So I'm working
in a tollbooth now.
I originally wanted to be
a male model,
but turns out I'm not
very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.
I'm sorry
to hear that.
I'm all right.
I'm recovering.
This is my favorite part
of the song right here.
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.
JULIAN:
Sonny!
Too late.
Okay. Just hang out
a little bit, all right?
I'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.
What are you doing?
You forgot to say good night.
What do you mean? I did?
I can't go to sleep
until you say good night.
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry. Good night.
Go to sleep now,
all right?
What'd we learn
about girls today?
Initiating the conversation
is half the battle.
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?
I gave him NyQuil.
He should be out for the night.
This is Styx.
Yeah.
They've been my favorite
band since I was like 12.
You're kidding me.
No, no, I can't help it.
I just love them.
My friends make fun
of me all the time.
My friends make fun
of me all the time too.
I've seen them like 25 times.
Tommy Shaw, when I was 16
years old, I was at the concert,
and he actually reached down,
grabbed my hand,
pulled me on stage.
I got to do the robot voice
for "Mr. Roboto."
Really?
No, I made that up. I'm sorry.
That would've been cool, right?
Yeah.
But seriously though,
my cousin's friends
with their drummer,
so when they come to town,
we get to go out to dinner with them,
and they tell us stories
from the road, stuff like that.
Really?
No, I made that up again too.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
You're not attracted to, like,
No.
Yeah, I don't like them either.
I can't sleep.
Okay.
He can't sleep.
So the rabbit ran
across the street
because he thought
he saw some carrots.
But when he got
across the street,
it turned out they
weren't carrots,
they were peanuts.
Peanuts?
Yeah.
The peanuts belonged
to a squirrel
who had taken them home
from a baseball game.
Right. And then the rabbit
thought to himself,
"Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.
And the squirrel said,
"Of course."
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.
And so was the squirrel.
And the rabbit thought that
the squirrel had very pretty hair.
And nice eyes also.
And the squirrel thought
the rabbit was really nice too.
And then, uh, the rabbit
worked up his courage
and asked the squirrel
if he could have
just the littlest squirrel kiss.
And the squirrel thought
it's just not the right time
in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits,
even though this particular rabbit
was very sweet.
And the rabbit got shut down,
did he?
That's all right.
But he was still
thinking maybe
Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss just, you know,
so somebody's getting
some action around here.
Good night, Scuba Steve.
Good night, Frankenstein.
Good night, Sonny.
Good night, Layla.
SONNY:
Don't get caught under
the bleachers with any girls.
It's your first day. Take it slow.
I'll meet you right after school
at 2:30, right out front.
Okay?
You're not staying?
No, I can't stay. I gotta go
get you some more ketchup.
I don't like these kids.
I don't like these kids much either,
but don't you think we should give
them a chance?
No?
All right. How's this?
TEACHER:
Okay, everybody. Come on in.
Here are the magic sunglasses.
You put them on
if you feel scared, okay?
Uh-oh! I lost you.
Julian, I don't know where
you are, pal. I'm sorry.
Julian? Yo!
Oh, there you go.
Come on, you go inside
and make some friends.
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.
All right. Go, go. Go inside.
I'm gonna miss you.
Hi, I like your hat.
What's your name?
DAVID LEE ROTH: Might as well...
SONNY: Leave a message!
Might as well...
Leave a message!
BROOKS:
Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks
from Social Services.
I got good news.
I think we may have found
a family for Julian.
Uh, why don't you give me
a call back as soon as possible
so we can set up a meeting? Bye.
Sierra Club Legal Department.
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?
Layla, line four.
Hello?
You're a lawyer?
What are you doing, goofball?
Waiting for Julian to get
out of school so I can have
somebody to play with.
What are you doing?
I'm swamped.
I even gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.
I was gonna do
my laundry today too.
Where are you going?
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.
Yeah, I know that place.
Okay, well, maybe I'll see
you there then.
Maybe. I gotta go.
SONNY:
So I bought tickets off the guy
and the show was the night before.
LAYLA:
Maybe it was a mistake.
That's really nice, Layla,
but I don't think you know
what's going down on the streets.
It's hard to know
what's going down
on the streets
when you're in an office
seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.
You're not gonna tell me
to get a real job, are you?
No. You're a big boy.
I think it's cool you only
work one day a week.
Oh, my God. These are
the cutest things I've ever seen.
Yes, I know. I have them
in yellow also. I wear them
when I work out and stuff.
You know, Sonny, I think
it's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.
Yeah, well, I got him.
I was reading this article
the other day that was saying
the most important influences
in a kid's life are his friends.
Really? They said that?
Mm-hm.
You just better hope
he's not hanging out with
all those drug dealers
and delinquents in school.
Sonny, I'm kidding.
I know. I know.
Man, this Yoo-Hoo is good.
You know what else is good?
Smoking dope.
I ain't gonna rat you out.
You know, puffing the cheeba.
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J.
You know what I'm talking about?
I have a bellybutton.
You have a bellybutton?
Well, we all have bellybuttons.
You know what?
We all love Yoo-Hoo.
Especially Yoo-Hoo
with a little rum.
What's rum?
You don't know what rum is?
Rumpelstiltskin?
Rumpelstiltskin.
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.
Hey. Stay clean.
Stay focused.
Stay strong. Frankenstein,
have fun with your friends.
What are you doing
scratching so much?
I have ecza...
Eczema? Gross.
How do I make it
stop itching?
I don't know.
You scratch it.
Hey! Spaghetti-O's.
Do you like Spaghetti-O's?
Yeah?
Dented cans are half price.
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.
Here, give it a shot.
That's it, boy.
Put it in there.
Feels good, huh?
Hi, Sonny.
Hi, Sonny's friend.
His name's Frankenstein.
Hi, Frankenstein.
Remember me?
Help me. I'm lost.
I don't know where I am.
You don't gotta
do that anymore.
Look at that.
You guys wear the same
size T-shirt. That's cool.
Mm-hm. What's this
I hear about you doing
laundry with my sister?
Did she say I was
doing laundry with her?
Because where I come from,
it's called doing the hibbity-dibbity.
Ow!
I got eczema.
Oh, well, then you
shouldn't scratch it.
Don't tell him what to do. He can
scratch if he wants to scratch.
SONNY: Scratch.
Is that better?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I didn't know you knew
anything about kids.
I thought you were
a foot doctor.
It's not doctor stuff, stupid.
It's common sense.
Scratching spreads rashes.
Oh, so this is something
you learned at Hooters.
Mm-hm.
What the hell is he doing?
He's shopping.
Microsoft went down
three points.
That's real good.
See you later, Frankenstein.
Hey, you stay away from
the frozen-food section.
Your boobs'll harden.
Isn't Little Italy the greatest?
Yeah, I like it. Everyone's
always telling me to hang out
in the Village and SoHo.
Oh, that's all right.
But you gotta respect a place
where the fatter you are,
the cooler you are.
Last time I was here,
that guy was with a different girl.
But I guess he ate her
or something.
Hey, I went to Coney Island
today with the little boy.
You gotta take a look at this.
We had a blast together.
Ohh.
He's so happy.
SONNY:
He is such a good boy.
I tell you, if I have a kid
of my own someday, I hope
he's half as cool as that kid.
Is he picking your nose?
Yeah, he was picking
his own all day,
so I figured he could borrow mine.
That's sweet.
He must be miserable
without you right now.
No, he's in good hands.
Uh, you, sir...
Ooh, look at Brad's body.
Not an ounce of fat on it.
What?
Don't worry. I like yours better.
Okay, I got two queens,
two jacks and an ace.
I win.
Why do you win?
I got a two, a four, a 10,
an eight and a six.
I don't understand.
Why do you win?
Because I win.
What's the name of that game?
I win.
I'll get it!
What's up?
Hi, I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.
Oh, he's in China.
Who are you?
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. I'm confused.
Chinatown. He loves
those egg rolls.
Well, I've tried contacting
him several times and he
hasn't responded.
I'm concerned.
MIKE:
Hey! Lx-nay on the ketchup-nay.
Have him call me.
All right.
My body's definitely
better than his.
Without question.
So it took you a long time
to pencil me in, Layla.
You work all the time.
I know. I'm really excited.
You're excited about that.
How long you been this crazy?
I guess ever since
I was a little girl.
See, my mom got married
really young and pretty much
just raised us kids.
So when my dad took off,
she wasn't left
with a lot of options.
And I think that's
when I decided
that I just never wanted
to end up in that situation.
Now, that's actually
a good reason to be working.
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.
Well, you kick that ass
during the day, but at night
you have fun with Sonny.
The best of times
Are when I'm alone with you
Some rain, some shine
So two guys you were best
friends with in law school
fell in love with each other?
Yeah.
Is that strange for you?
No. I mean,
nothing changed, really.
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.
Hello.
SONNY:
My God! This is Corinne's place?
If the girls at Hooters
could see her now.
Do you want your ass kicked?
I'm just kidding around, Layla.
So, um...
I know you're afraid to
get involved and I know
you got a lot of work,
but when I'm not with you,
I'm thinking about you all the time.
Do you have that going on at all?
Maybe.
Maybe we should try
a kiss out. Just...
We owe it to ourselves to see if
we should move to the next level,
see if any sparks fly.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either. It's just
that you kissed Scuba Steve.
Ever since then,
he's been strutting around
the apartment bragging,
"I got a kiss the first night.
You've been with her three times,
you got nothing."
Oh, he said that?
Come on.
Let's just give it a shot
just so I can have some
dignity at home.
All right?
Okay.
CORINNE:
Oh, my God!
Gross!
Did I just witness
the first kiss?
Yeah, you did, Corinne.
Thanks a lot for showing up.
Aww, Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?
I don't know.
I'm going upstairs.
Wash your mouth out.
He's dirty.
And he's poor.
Hey, what do you got in the bag,
Corinne? Some chicken wings?
Booby tassels?
Shut up.
You have a good sleep
tonight there, Corinne.
Pleasant Hooters.
Come on, come on!
Okay.
This is where
we hang our jackets.
This is my hook.
Good one.
And that's a capertillar.
A caterpillar.
That's right, a capertillar.
Capertillar, all right.
Hey. Staying clean, pal?
Yes.
That's right. You drink the booze,
you lose. Remember that, punk.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Julian's teacher,
Ms. Foote. You his father?
Yeah, how you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.
I wonder if you'd give me
a few minutes
to go over a couple of things
that have been bothering me.
Sure.
Go take a walk, pal.
Uh, Julian has been displaying
some odd behavior.
Last week he spilled a tube of glue
on the floor and didn't tell anybody.
He just covered it with newspaper.
Uh-huh.
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.
Yeah?
And Julian tripped him with a stick.
I've never...
Julian found it hilarious.
I like him to feel like he can
express himself freely.
I've really never seen
any problems with that.
Eww!
Your boy's making the least
progress of any of the children
in the class.
And frankly, his personal hygiene
is becoming a cause for concern.
He's the smelly kid in class?
I let him become the smelly kid
in class?
What the hell's the matter
with me?
Oh, yes. I've had some
smelly ones before.
But your son is by far the smelliest.
All right, I got you, ma'am.
Take it easy. What do you
think I should do?
Well, you might start by paying
more attention to his schoolwork.
Okay.
The class is giving a presentation of
the Founding Fathers in two weeks.
And Julian has drawn
the part of Benjamin Franklin,
a very important role.
You should do
what you can to help.
All right, all right. I will turn this
all around. That's a promise.
Thank you
very much.
Hey, Stinky, let's get going.
You got us in trouble.
Did he call him
"Stinky"?
Wow, I didn't know this
about George Washington.
Yes, his teeth were
made of wool.
Wood.
Oh. I sorry.
I mix up "D" and "L."
Well, get it right.
Why don't you turn
that game off, pal?
I got four guys left.
Come on.
Let's study a little bit.
I don't wanna study.
Give me that.
You just killed me.
So what? Relax. You'll play later.
You can't tell me what to do.
Really? How about
we take a vote?
Who thinks the kid
should start studying?
Who doesn't?
Well, you just lost, two to one.
No, it's a tie.
That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.
I know, I know, I know.
He was just joking around.
Listen, can you
hang out here a little bit?
I gotta go do something.
No problem.
KANGAROO :
Would you like
KANGAROO & JULIAN :
We'll hop, hop, hop, hop
What do you say?
Get the door.
Hi, Julian. How you doing?
I'm Scuba Sam.
Scuba Steve's father.
You see, my boy
needs to take a bath.
The only problem is
he's afraid to bathe alone.
So I was wondering
if maybe you could
keep him company in the tub.
Terrific. And after the bath,
you have to try and study hard.
Because if you wanna be
a member of the Scuba Squad,
you have to be smart.
I could be in
the Scuba Squad?
Well, sure. All you have to do
is work hard.
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad,
because then everybody's
gonna wanna join.
And one more thing,
be nice to the delivery guy,
would you?
It's not his fault he can't read.
Take care.
SONNY:
Yeah, yeah. He told me
to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to talk
to you about some secret
mission or something.
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Okay.
How come I have to wear
a bathing suit?
I don't know.
I don't know the rules
with little kids and grownups
and being naked and just sit down.
The good news is you're starting
not to smell like a foot anymore.
Hey, I read something
interesting today.
You know that Benjamin
Franklin invented bifocals?
That's pretty cool, huh?
What are they?
I'll show you
in that book I'm reading.
There's a lot of cool stuff
in there. It might help you out
with your school play.
Okay.
We'll make this a regular thing.
Bathing and studying
and eating right.
Put your head back.
This is what my grandmother
used to do to me.
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."
Can you still have fun?
Yeah, we can have fun.
But after you study.
In fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.
After you get out,
we'll go to Barney's.
Barney?
Not that Barney. A different Barney.
A more expensive Barney.
All right, one at a time.
That's one.
Two.
SONNY:
See? Urinals are good too.
"Electricity."
Very good.
"Constitution."
That's it.
"Philadelphia."
Smart. Good.
"Fish"?
Yeah.
"Pony"?
Yes.
"Hip..."
"Hiphop..."
"Hipopynonamous"?
Damn you! You gave him
the easy ones!
MAN: Thanks!
You're welcome.
Slow down.
You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.
SONNY: Okay.
Whoa.
There's a pole there.
My name is
Alexander Hamilton.
I was the first Secretary
of the Treasury.
I owned a bank
and a newspaper.
Aaron Bird shot me.
Hi, my name is
Benjamin Franklin.
I was a writer, a diplomat,
an inventor and a statesman,
although I only went to school
for two years.
I wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.
All right.
The Declaration of Independence
is finished.
Who will be
the first to sign?
How about you, John Hancock?
KIDS: I want to sign!
Look at my man stand strong.
He's so cute.
DELIVERY GUY:
What are your cards?
I got a six, a five, a jack,
a four and a eight.
I win.
What do you mean, you win?
I had a hand just like that
before. I didn't win.
Because I win.
This is bullshit!
All right.
Take it easy, man.
Every time it's different cards.
He still wins.
So what? Relax. He's a kid.
There should be same set of rules
for everyone, no matter what age.
He's gotta learn
how to lose too.
Hello, Mr. Koufax.
Hey, Mr. Brooks, how you doing?
I was gonna give you
a buzz.
You just called me Mr. Koufax
though, didn't you?
It is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?
You fraudulently held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity
to gain custody of young
Julian over there.
Big problem in this state, Sonny.
Well...
I've delivered
to you before.
You always order
three pieces of cheesecake.
The real Kevin Gerrity
called me up, he asked
me to take care of...
Save it, Mr. Koufax.
The kid has to come with me now
or I'll have you arrested.
Take out your
handcuffs then.
I don't have any handcuffs,
but two policemen downstairs do.
Listen, Sonny,
I would like to help,
but my status in your country
is not what you would call legal.
It's okay.
I'm Audi.
Julian, you're gonna
have to come with me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Just give me...
Sonny.
One second, pal.
Would you just please
give me a second to
say goodbye to the kid?
Take a second.
You don't want me here
anymore?
No, that's not it, pal.
You just gotta go away
for a little while.
How long am I going away for?
I don't wanna lie to you.
I don't think we're gonna
be seeing each other
anymore.
I screwed up, pal.
I'm so sorry.
Come here.
Put your coat on.
It's not your fault, okay?
I'm the idiot.
I don't wanna go.
I know you don't.
I know, but you have to,
and you're gonna be okay,
all right?
Please don't make me go.
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what else to do.
I won't play
the kangaroo song anymore.
Come on.
Just go.
You gotta go.
You gotta go.
JULIAN:
I don't wanna go. I promise,
I'm sorry. I don't even
like that song anymore.
I know, pal. That's not it.
But I wipe my own ass!
I wipe my own ass!
I know.
Layla, they took the kid.
Who?
Social Services.
I gotta get him back.
What do you mean?
You said this was
just temporary.
I know, I know. I can't
have it be temporary.
It's gotta be permanent.
Okay, what can we do?
Well, I filed a brief to get
custody based on the
best interests of the child.
And Tommy knew one of the clerks,
so they fast-tracked the hearing.
It's Tuesday. You gotta be there.
This Tuesday?
What, you got work?
I gotta go to Washington.
There's a hearing to dismiss
my case.
Well, can you get
somebody else to do it?
I'm sorry, Sonny.
I can't. It's my case.
What about Julian's case?
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.
Sonny, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna get involved.
I had things going
just the way I wanted.
And then I'm sitting at the park,
and you and this kid just come
barging into my life,
and it's screwing up everything
I had planned.
A kid showed up on my doorstep.
You think I planned on that?
But I fell in love with him.
So now my plans have changed.
BAILIFF:
All rise.
JUDGE:
Good morning.
We're here to determine
proper custody of Julian McGrath,
also known as Julian Gerrity,
a minor child.
Representing the city
of New York?
Ted Castellucci.
Arthur Brooks,
Social Services.
And representing
Sonny Koufax?
Phillip D'Amato.
Thomas Grayton.
Plus, I'll pretty much
be representing myself,
Your Honor.
Anyone else?
Layla Maloney,
Your Honor.
Thank you.
Does this mean that
you love me, Layla?
Something like that.
JUDGE:
First witness.
Koufax is a good egg.
He was nice to that kid.
But he fights like a girl.
You like that?
I'm right here, miss.
What are you
gonna do about it?
What, are you drunk,
Mr. Herlihy?
Well, I had a few chardonnays.
What of it?
Get off the stand, please.
You got it.
I've got a few problems.
Off to a good start.
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy.
I wish my dad was as cool as him.
You see, my dad
was a military man.
Guess I wasn't such
a "good soldier."
When I was 35 years old,
he attempted to give me a crew cut
while I was sleeping one afternoon.
I woke up, broke his arm,
haven't seen him since.
I'd rather live out on the streets
than under his freaky-ass rules.
Ah, anyway, I think
Mr. Koufax should be
acquitted of all the charges.
If O.J. Can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.
No more questions.
No more questions...
And how long have
you been delivering
food to Mr. Koufax?
I deliver food
for six years.
Plus, I'm stripper.
But I've put on weight
so it's problem.
I see. And in your experience,
was Sonny a good father to Julian?
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.
Lamb and tuna fish?
Maybe like spaghetti
and meatball?
You more comfortable
with that analogy?
HOMELESS GUY:
Yes, considering we're in America.
I mean, if you don't like
spaghetti and meatballs,
why don't you get the hell out?
I'll come down there
and give you a crew cut.
Let's see your clippers.
Not my problem your
father was sick.
Stop yelling at me!
Order! Order! Order!
Excuse me.
Am I in the right room?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.
He has enough co-counsels.
Well...
one more wouldn't hurt.
Let's get on with it.
Next witness.
Your Honor, Mr. Koufax
is simply parading his
buddies up there.
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?
PHIL: And what were Julian
and Mr. Koufax doing when
you saw them?
Shopping.
And did Mr. Koufax
appear to be an attentive
and loving father?
He certainly did.
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?
Since the day I met him.
And for the record,
where did you work while you
attended medical school?
Hooters.
No further questions.
Asshole.
Next witness.
Your Honor, we'd like
to call Julian McGrath.
If it's okay with you, Julian,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
This is just
you and me talking,
so don't even pay attention
to all these people, okay?
Can you tell me
how old you are?
Your Honor, one second.
That's better, huh?
Now can you tell me
how old you are?
Five.
And what's your birthday?
July 15th.
Do you know where
you were born?
Toronto.
Toronto? I thought
you were from Buffalo.
I moved to Buffalo
with my mommy.
LAYLA:
And for the past six weeks,
you've been living with Sonny, right?
Yes.
Did you and Sonny
have fun together?
Yes.
What kind of things
would you do with Sonny?
He taught me how to do the sleeper
hold like Chief Jay Strongbow.
LAYLA:
That's nice.
Anything else?
He taught me how to pee
on a building.
LAYLA:
Really?
And he taught me that Styx
was one of the greatest
American rock bands.
And they only caught
a bad rap
because most critics
are cynical assholes.
Well, I think we'd all
agree with that.
Now, before you came to Sonny's
apartment, do you remember
the last thing your mommy
said to you was?
That she loved me and I was
gonna live with my new daddy.
And if your mother could
pick anyone in the world
to be your new daddy,
who do you think she'd pick?
Sonny.
LAYLA:
Thank you, Julian.
You can step down now.
That went good though,
don't you think?
I don't know. Judge
doesn't look too happy.
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?
I'd like to call upon myself,
Your Honor.
Awesome.
And which of your esteemed
co-counsels will be examining you?
My father,
Lenny Koufax.
What?
Forget it, Sonny.
What is going on?
Your Honor, there is
nobody in this world
who thinks I shouldn't have a child
more than that man back there.
He also happens to be
one of the most respected
lawyers in all of Florida.
So I figure if I can make a believer
out of him, I can make a believer
out of everybody in this court.
Objection,
Your Honor.
This court is after the truth,
not the opinion of the
defendant's father.
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.
I withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.
Mr. Koufax.
This is a big mistake, Sonny.
The only reason I came today
is to make sure you didn't
end up in jail for this.
Well, then that was nice
of you. Thank you.
To do what I think is right here.
Okay.
After this is over, get your
fingernails cut. They're too long.
Okay, Dad.
MR. KOUFAX:
Your Honor, this case is simple.
It is absurd to think that
Sonny Koufax is ready
to raise a child.
Objection!
Shut up, Tommy.
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.
First of all, how did this
sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?
I told Social Services
that my name was
Kevin Gerrity.
Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
No.
So you lied.
Yes.
MR. KOUFAX:
Like the time I found a bag of pot
in your underwear drawer
and you told me that you thought
they were pencil shavings.
Yeah.
And remember when I called you up
and told you that your Aunt Fay
was coming to New York,
and I wanted you to take
her around, show her the city?
And you said that you had
better things to do, didn't you?
That's right.
Now, I'm curious.
Just what were those better
things that you had to do?
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so I caught that.
MR. KOUFAX:
Uh-huh.
And what happened to your
Aunt Fay that weekend?
She died.
Yes, she did.
By any chance, did you happen
to make it to her funeral?
No.
Why not?
I went to Jones Beach,
got drunk and fell asleep.
Hell, yes!
Some role model.
Yeah.
Your Honor,
my son doesn't have
health insurance.
He doesn't know
how to boil an egg.
He filed for social security
at the age of 30.
He is a drain on the economy,
on the country,
and most of all, on me!
Your Honor,
to give this young man
custody over another life
is not only wrong,
it's insane.
Hey. I love you.
What?
You don't have to be scared.
It's all right.
What are you talking about?
I'm not scared.
If I get custody of Julian,
I'll be his father forever.
And that scares you
because you think there's
a good chance I might fail.
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
It's a certainty.
You're wrong, Dad.
You can be scared that
I might get pickpocketed
in a bad neighborhood
or I might break
my legs skiing.
But don't be scared about
me being a dad, because
I will not fail at that. I can't.
I love this kid too much.
I love him as much
as you love me, Dad.
And I'm gonna give him advice
and I'm gonna guide him
and I'm gonna be there for him
whenever he needs me.
I'll fly to New York to be
at his court case
even if I disagree with why
he's there in the first place.
But, Sonny,
you work in a tollbooth.
Don't be scared about
me making money.
I am in love with a beautiful girl
who makes plenty of it.
She'll be my sugar mama.
Oh, I gotta get me one of those.
I know this is the right thing
to do, Dad, because I would
die for this kid
just so he wouldn't have to
feel one ounce of sadness.
That's why you're here right now,
to protect me, to be scared for me,
to be a good father.
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna be.
Hello, Dad?
Yeah, I just
wanted to say I love you.
Hi, Mom? Could you
put Dad on the phone
for a second?
Can I borrow that
when you're done?
Your Honor,
my son deserves this kid.
I love you too, sir.
JUDGE:
Mr. Koufax,
the fact is
you kidnapped this child.
Not only shouldn't
you get custody,
but since you obtained the child
by defrauding the state of New York,
you should be in jail.
Bailiff, please remand him until
I can figure out the punishment.
Your Honor, I think...
Wait. You can't take him away.
As that boy's father,
I refuse to press charges.
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.
Six years ago, Joe Carter...
Joe Carter?
Toronto and the Phillies.
You know, World Series.
Mitch Williams just...
We flew up for the night.
There was a girl.
Oh, God.
I'm an idiot.
I was so hammered.
Chicken wings and Molson 3-0.
You know Canadian beer
is like moonshine.
Hell, yes.
Sonny, you remember, right?
It was at that Toronto Hooters.
Oh, yeah.
That was before he met
you though, Corinne.
That Hooters thing,
that's a coincidence.
I'm sorry, Corinne.
I know this changes everything,
but I had to do the right thing.
Mr. Castellucci.
I, uh...
Pending a blood test, I...
Whatever.
Then the court grants custody
to Kevin Gerrity, pending
the results of a DNA test.
No!
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.
I know. I do too, pal.
But I'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.
But I'll tell you what I can do.
I can be your friend,
no matter what. All right?
I'll always be your friend.
I'll always be your family.
I'll always be around.
I promise.
SONNY:
The kid's pretty good
at tying his shoes.
He's not great at it though,
so you gotta work with him.
KEVIN:
Maybe I'll teach him
the bunny ears thing.
SONNY:
What's the bunny ears thing?
You make the bunny ears,
and then you cross
and pull them through.
I go with this loop, swoop
and pull thing. He likes that.
I don't know that one.
The bunny...
Go with the loop,
swoop and pull thing.
I swear to God
it's working.
All right.
You know what?
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.
It's important, when you eat
at my restaurant,
you never order BLT.
You must trust me.
Stay away from BLT, okay?
Hey, guys.
I'm gonna leave you
with your dad now, Julian.
He's a good man right here.
I've known him my whole life.
So you two have fun
and I'll see you in the
morning for breakfast.
All right?
Quit scaring the kid
for a minute.
Who am I scaring?
Bye, pal.
Hey, Julian. Um...
I just got back from China.
Do you know where that is?
It's in Asia,
which is by Europe.
Uh, I brought some
cool stuff back.
Aah!
Did you move
the bench?
That's pretty funny, huh?
You know what I got?
I got some noisemakers.
Check this out.
Wanna try one?
Ah, that's my foot!
You're nice man.
Listen, at my place
I've got Spice Channel.
It's blurry but it's nice.
Let's make this quick though, okay?
I wanna get back to work.
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.
Well, I'm working on a big case.
I gotta sue you assholes for
making me come here.
ALL:
Surprise!
Did you just waste
the good surprise
on me again?
Hi, Corinne.
Happy birthday.
Thanks, everybody.
Hey, you guys.
How are you?
Happy birthday, Daddy.
How you doing, cutie?
Sonny, I beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.
Well, then I guess from now on,
I have to stop letting you win.
I stopped letting him
win six months ago.
He's still beating me.
That's because
you suck.
Hey, Corinne, why don't
you put a tank top on for
old time's sake? Come on.
What is he talking
about, Mommy?
Nothing.
Happy birthday, Sonny.
Hey, hey, hey. Thank you.
I got you a clock radio.
Clock radio?
Thanks for telling me.
I have to split.
I got more deliveries.
Come on, hang out with us.
We're gonna have fun.
No, no, no, I can't stay.
I'll hang for a little bit.
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.
Sonny!
Hey, you!
Still missing
that tooth, huh?
Hey, can we get
some curly fries?
Vanessa.
Hi, Sonny.
You're a Hooters girl?
What happened
to Sid's five-year plan?
How you doing?
Maybe it's a 10-year plan.
Is that the guy
with the old balls?
Yeah. I think it is.
Hey, come on.
I bet they're nice.
Aww.
Okay, well, I don't think
you're supposed to say "balls."
Testicles. Okay?
