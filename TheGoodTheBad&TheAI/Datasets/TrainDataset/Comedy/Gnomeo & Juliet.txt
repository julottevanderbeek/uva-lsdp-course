The story you are about to see,
has been told before.
A lot.
And now we are going to tell it, again.
But different.
It's about two star crossed lovers,
kept apart by a big feud.
No one knows how this feud started,
but it's all quite entertaining.
Unfortunately, before we begin.
There is a rather long boring prologue,
which I will read to you now.
Two households.
Both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona.
Where we lay our scene.
From ancient grudge.
Break to new mutiny.
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.
Mr. Capulet: Ah Miss. Montague.
How you just love to ruin my day.
Miss Montague: My Sisters dear cardigan.
Mr. Capulet, it suits you.
-Capulet: Feisty old hag.
-Montague: Grumbly old codger.
Oink...oink
Oh, great.
Sniff...sniff.
I got one! I got one!
I got one! I got one!
Oh.
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.
*Background music 'Crocodile Rock'*
Huh, Tybalt!
Hold on. Blues are at it again.
Lady Blueberry: Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.
Lady Blueberry
Your tulips are looking a little limp this
year, aren't they.
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.
The proper word is 'insinuating'.
Illiterate.
I am not illiterate.
My parents were married!
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.
'Shroom all clear?
Lady Blueberry sings: Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Benny: Gnomeo, it's your mum.
Gnomeo: Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,
...our beautiful, beautiful garden,
from this angle?
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.
Lady Blueberry: That tree was your
father's pride and joy.
May he rest in pieces.
Oh, how you remind me of him.
Oh which is why I wanted to say.
I know, I know. My chores.
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting, pruning,
consider it all done.
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!
...done.
All I wanted to say was...
Good luck.
Thanks, mom.
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.
Red, I hate the word.
Wow.
Juliet: A 'Cupids Arrow' orchid.
Oh, Juliet!
Oh!
Whoa!
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.
Oh, you want to get smashed?
A flower that will put that
blue garden to shame.
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...
Uh, I am a Red after all.
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was.
Bless her to bits.
Now, back where you belong.
I  can't just stay tucked away on
this pedestal all my life.
Don't you see.
When will you realize you're delicate.
I'm not delicate.
She's definitely not delicate.
Lord Redbrick: Stubborn girl.
Oh, right.
Delicate, hmm.
I'll show him who's delicate.
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
-Okay boys,  ya all know the rules.
And I don't need to repeat them, but I'm gonna.
'Cus I wanna.
And here they are.
No biting, no scratching, no kicking.
No burping, no slurping, no prancing.
No squalling, no laughing,
no heeing, no hawing.
And more than anything...
nooo cheating!
No cheating?
Hey, that's not fair.
*Saturday Night's Alright *
-On your marks.
Get going.
*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*
*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*
*My sister looks cute in her braces and boots.
A handful of grease in her hair.*
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*
*Whoa, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in.*
*Get about as oiled as a diesel train.
Gonna set this dance alight.*
*Cause Saturday night's the night I like.
Saturday night's all right, all right, all right.*
*Woo, oo, ooo.*
*Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.*
*Tybalt, Tybalt.*
*Saturday, Saturday, Saturday.*
*Saturday night's all right.*
Whoa!
*Saturday...*

-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
............-Huh?......................................
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth
is getting even bigger than your hat.
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.
Yeah, the 'finish' line.
Adios, loser.
Benny: Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.
No body won't come out.
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.
Well if he won't come out.
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.
Then I say. It's about time someone did.
And payback is gonna be fun.
Click...click...whirl.
'Shroom, let's go kick some grass.
This mission into Red garden territory,
is gonna require maximum stealth.
Benny in deep voice: Well you won't get
much stealthier than this.
Hello.
Mumbles: I got one.
Mumbles: I got one.
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.
Oh.
Mumbles: I got one.
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.
And I'm going to need you to cover me.
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.
I'm washing my hair.
I don't have hair.
He'll know it's a lie.
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.
I'll be quick.
-
-Growling.
-
-
Out, out!
Man: Ben stop, over here boy.
Wow! That was quick.
I'm to easy to see.
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.
Oooo, a new outfit.
I'm on it.
Here.
That is cute.
Give it a turn.
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.
Now go get your flower.
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?
How much less?
Try black.
Aaaaaaah!
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you
any attention in that.
Then it's perfect.
Oooo,
I'm going in.
Take care.
I'm telling your Dad
you're doing your hair.
Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a movie.
It's a...it's one word.
And it starts with a...'spider'.
All: Is it, Spiderman?
Oh you're good, okay.
Great, I love going commando.
Shh, I know, just the key.
Shhh.
Okay, I have another one.
Two words.
The first word is, 'Spiderman'.
All: Spiderman Two?
Okay, who's cheating?
Benny, give me the paint.
Benny?
Gnomeo whispers: No!
-Benny!
Benny!
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.
Run for it, now.
Tybalt: Where did he go?
Small red Gnome: He's in the begonia's.
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.
Find him!
-Not here.
-Not here, either.
Nothing but Pansies here.
Come on.
Hold on.
Whoa, whoooa!
-Hey, Benny
-What?
-See you on the other side.
-Benny: Gnomeo!
Benny: Nooo!
Ah, ha, ha.
Capulet: Hmm.
I wish I could stay but...
...gotta fly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!
Huh!
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*
*Feel I'm feeling light*
*I like to see the sights.*
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*
*Ducking up and down*
*All these crazy sights and sounds*
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*
*Famous last lines of a fool*
*Just when you think.*
*Your chain is just one link.*
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*
*Someone's out there saying hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't...this isn't my garden.
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.
-Oh, this?
-Yes.
I don't know. I think I'm going to
have to keep ahold of this one.
What? But I saw it first.
So why don't you just hand it over.
Well I grabbed it first.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
But if you want it.
-Come and get it.
-All right.
Thanks.
Aaaah!
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.
What, and miss this view?
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?
Whoa!
Who's your Gno-me now?
*Hello, Hello.*
-Hey!
*My, my, my what have we here?*
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*
*Someone's out there saying, hello*
*Hello.*
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*
*Hello, hello.*
*Heeeellooooo.*
*Hello,
hellooooooooooo.*
Oh no, he's a blue.
Not a blue.
Juliet. You're not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same
question, Tybalt.
We're looking for a blue Gnome.
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.
Got a scratch, right here.
And his name's Gnomeo.
You haven't seen him, have you?
Uhhhhooo, um.
Uhh, he sounds awful, no.
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.
Well lucky you.
Come on, let's get inside.
Juliet.
Gnomeo: A red.
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?
Sooo, where is the oh so important,
life changing orchid?
Juliet: Um...
Um...
What, what orchid?
What?
Hmmm?
Shut up!
You met a boy.
What? No! Well maybe...
Sort of, um...yes!
Yes I did.
I need details.
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?
Well let's call it sturdy.
And his uh..
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.
You might say it looks sort of...
...blue.
Blue.
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.
No, I don't get it.
Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep,
you cannot take with a blue.
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.
Zzzzip.
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!
-Is it?
-It's doomed.
-What?
-A red and a blue.
*Romantic music*
It just can't be.
So it's a doomed love.
And that's the best kind.
You'll never see him again.
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".
"I only saw him once".
I'll only see...what do you mean?
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.
How romantically tragic.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
Your love is doomed.
Your love is dead.
It's doomed.
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?
Nanette: Dooomed!
Conjoined Gnome: I've never seen
Lord Redbrick so riled up.
We have to find Gnomeo.
Let's split up.
I wish I could quit ya.
Both: Hmm.
Oh well.
Let's go fishing.
All right, mate.
Go find, Gnomeo.
Nanette: Doomed!
Dead!
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.
Oh, Gnomeo.
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.
To never see each other again?
Why must you wear a blue hat?
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or...
green like a leprechaun, or...
or purple like, um...
like uh, like some weird guy.
I mean what's in a Gnome?
Because you're blue my father sees red,
and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing
to keep us apart.
-Should it?
-Gnomeo: No, no! It shouldn't.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...
I came here, to...
Well... I don't know,
I just wanted to see you again.
Are you crazy?
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.
I'm trying.
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Juliet: Do something.
-The button's stuck.
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*
Ah, Juliet!
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.
There's somebody behind you!
Gnomeo: Shroom!
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!
Juliet! What's the big....
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.
Excuse me, little help here.
Juliet: My dad's coming.
So, you must be, Gnomeo.
Lovely to meet you.
Even though it's seconds,
before you're discovered and killed.
-Quick, hide.
-Lord Redbrick: Juliet!
I told you before, no music in the
grotto after ten o'clock.
What's going on here?
Um, It was a...
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.
And he...he...
...dropped his nuts.
Yes, nuts.
The size of...boulders.
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.
Well, okay. But no mucking about.
Especially not tonight.
We've been attacked.
By a blue!
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.
Lord Redbrick, I've been having
problems with my...
-Your what?
-
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.
It's not ideal.
-But I...
-Just go.
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.
-Um...
-What?
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.
I mean it's just as pondy as ever.
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?
Lord Redbrick: What? What was it?
-Juliet: That thing, over there.
-Lord Redbrick: What did it look like?
-Juliet: Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince,
and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, or whatever.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Oh!
Oh.
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.
What?
Whoa!
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.
Thank you.
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.
No, really. I'm stuck.
So, uh, heh...
Can I see you again tomorrow?
Yes, but not here.
Back in the old Lawrence place then?
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.
I can do 11:45.
Done.
That frog was right.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you,
when he finds how much you weigh.
Shroom, you see this face?
It's a happy Gnome face.
Now come here.
Come on.
Mr. Capulet: Outrage, infamy!
Mr. Capulet: The gardening gloves
are off then, are they?
Miss Montague: You, wrecking my mower.
Mr. Capulet: Dear lady,
you are insane in the brain.
Miss Montague: I never thought that even you'd
stoop to such levels.
Mr. Capulet: Oh, and by the way, kindly stop
stealing my underwear.
Miss Montague: In your dreams,
you jacked off cabbage.
Mr. Capulet: Oh, how could she do this
to Tybalts wishing well?
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.
Why would anyone ever pick on you?
Miss Montague: Who thinks I should
order the best, new lawnmower?
Money can buy.
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?
All: Because nobody likes him.
-
-So what are we going to do?
Find their weak spot.
Then what are we going to do?
Damage.
Lot's and lot's of damage.
Miss Montague: Right.
Mess with me will you, Capulet.
I'll show him what, that old pompous.
It's not over, not by a long shot.
Miss Montague: Yeah, uh, right.
What have we got here?
Show the world the mighty web.
Miss Montague: Oh, no. No, no, not good.
Pick one.
-Yes, that one.
-Miss Montague: No.
Benny: Oh, yes that one.
Miss Montague: What's this?
Well brother maybe it's time
for a secret weapon.
ground dominating piece of hardware,
the world has ever seen.
It clears
Echoes: Clears.
It digs
Echoes: Digs.
It mow's
Echo: Mow's.
That one.
Miss Montague: Oh my.
Benny pleads: Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.
Benny: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Miss Montague: That's a bit in-your-face.
Miss Montague: This is more my speed.
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.
Oh, no.
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*
Definitely not.
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*
*When I was down*
*I was your clown*
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*
*I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
*Don't go breaking my heart.*
*Don't go breaking my.
I won't go breaking your heaaaaaaart.*
*Don't go breaking my...
I won't go breaking your heart.*
Lord Redbrick: Juliet. There you are.
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our
little discussion yesterday.
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.
Who'll keep you safe.
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.
Yes, yes of course, why?
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.
-Dad!
-All right, all right.
No one will ever say I don't
know when I'm not wanted.
-Lord Redbrick: Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.
Here it is, gypsaphilla.
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.
You think you got it down and bram,
you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.
Even though you thought
it was a level of chalk.
Weird.
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit,
rude to leave me on a first date.
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.
A small token of my affection.
Oh, wow!
Juliet, do you realize what this is?
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.
Oh, a love triangle.
Which I call, Foxcup.
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.
Well, I mean I know,
I've got my dark side, sure.
Hey there, Juliet.
What a name, it's a great name.
Goes with your, eyes.
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?
That's a killer, man.
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!
Uh,  never better.
Do you think anyone heard that?
There's nobody here.
Then why are you whispering?
Why are you whispering.
Oh, look at that.
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.
Let's start her up.
Yeah, okay.
Check out the power on this beauty.
She's empty.
Bingo!
-Juliet: Hey, try this.
-Thanks.
-Is that you?
-Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
It's me, too!
What was that?
I have no idea.
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.
And...and I'm not afraid to use it.
Do you think I scared it?
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.
Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.
And setting me free.
I love you!
Do you know what it's like to
be trapped for thirty years?
All alone, by yourself.
No one for to talk at.
Hola, Featherstone,
como esta usted?
Ah, bueno, Featherstone,
how's the other leg?
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.
Oh, oh, oh. Pup, pup, pup.
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes.
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.
Both: Date! No, no not dating.
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.
-Juliet: Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?
-He's a blue.
-And she's a red.
And I'm pink!
Who cares?
Anyway, I got to ask.
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?
Ohh, I know, I know.
Un momento, I'll be right back.
Juliet, wait.
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Gnomeo: GO!
Whoo, hoo, hoo!
Ta da!
Featherstone: Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...
We still got to do something about these weeds.
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.
Well I don't know. A weed
by any other name is still a weed.
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?
Kinda pass you out, huh?
I going to sit down now.
I've got a confession to make.
I've never actually driven a mower.
No, you're a natural.
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.
You know this is crazy, right?
Yeah.
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.
Oh and me a blue.
No way.
My whole life my mom raised me to
hate you guys. You reds.
So, this could never work.
Could it?
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.
Can it?
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.
Oh baby, you know I
getting into this now.
See the trick is to go like...
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.
And uh, I promise.
Your secret is safe with me.
Well, should we?
I can do 11:45.
Not soon enough.
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.
Careful there, you're going to kick something.
What's eating you?
Huh?
How?
Lady Blueberry: How?
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.
How could this have happened?
Well, where were you?
I was...
I was nowhere.
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed,
the most beautiful thing we blues have.
Your father planted her.
We raised her from a seedling.
Those blasted Reds, come on.
We'll make them pay.
Every last one of them.
Every last one?
*It's a little bit runny.*
*This pesticide.*
-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.
-Oh, this is painful.
-Oh, sweet torture.
*
Don't have much money.*
*But, but if I did.*
*I'd buy a big house where.*
*We both could live.*
*If I was  a sculptor...*
-Ooo, sexy, sexy.
*A man selling stuff for plants
it's called, Miracle grow.*
Uh, Gnomeo!
Okay.
Then we go need a bunch of coconuts.
-
-Wha...?
Gnomeo: Juliet no, wait.
I...I um...
A blue, a blue!
-Abort, abort the mission.
-What?
-What happened.
-Ah, the nozzle jammed, let's go.
Gnomeo!
Hmmm.
Tybalt: Such a big hat,
on such a small gnome.
So, you boys fancy a little bit of fun?
Let's take this baby out into the alley.
Then what are going to do?
We're gonna have a smashing time.
Gnomeo: Oh come on, Juliet.
It's  not as bad as all that.
Is that your big move on a second date?
You wine them, dine them and
then spray them with weed killer?
You got to admit, it is original.
Hola, my fellow funsters are back already.
I mean be reasonable.
I didn't have a choice...
...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?
Just a toilet in the middle of a yard,
with nothing growing out of it.
Oh you blues are so infuriating.
Wait a minute, us blues?
So, what you guys want to do?
-Featherstone, we're busy.
-Come on guys.
-Let us have some-a fun.
-Let me tell you something about you reds.
-Us reds?
-Oh, can't we all just laugh about this?
I know the little mushroom can.
Both shout: Featherstone!
-We're in the middle of something.
-You wouldn't understand.
-We're talking.
-All right, so just leave us alone.
Right,
I'm sorry.
You know sometimes I get
a little over excited.
Especially having such great new friends.
Like you and...
But I know I can be a bit...
...much.
Wait, Featherstone.
-Hey.
-Juliet: Come back, Featherstone. I'm sorry.
Featherstone: I may not be a smart bird.
But I know what love is.
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*
*Then*
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*
*There's only so much you can do,
to keep some things alive*
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*
*Each one of us knowing,
every inch of it was us.*
*We pulled it all together,
hoping and believing.*
*That love built this garden
for the two of us to dream in.*
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.
And...
I couldn't do nothing about it.
But you...
...you can.
You know I think that crazy pink
plastic bird might be right.
What if we never went back?
Never go back?
But what about my Dad?
And Nanette and the red garden?
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.
But here, here we're a matching pair.
Juliet, will you stay here, and
build a garden with me?
I'd love to.
*Solemn music*
Benny: GNOMEO!
What are you doing?
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.
BENNY!
Benny, wait.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little-big-hat, Benny.
Mess with the red garden, will ya.
Gnomeo: BENNY!
NO!
Ooo, that felt good.
Oh no!
Oh, no.
Tybalt!
A hat for a hat.
Gnomeo, no!
You wouldn't attack an
unarmed Gnome, would ya?
Sucker.
Pity.
Tybalt, the wall.
You don't I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do ya?
Ha, ha, what wall?
Ut oh, that wall.
Blast!
What was that?
What's happened?
Tybalt?
Tybalt.
Tybalt?
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.
Ooo.
Smash him hat.
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.
No, he didn't do it.
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.
-Catch.
-What?
Smash him back.
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!
Stop, stop that.
Revenge!
Whup!
Woman: Woo...
-What were you doing?
-No!
-I love him.
-What?
Doomed.
Oh, someone do something.
Gnomeo!
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.
He's gone.
Oh Gnomeo.
No, no not Gnomeo.
Let's get you home now.
Lady Blueberry sobbing:
Oh, my poor, poor boy.
Hmm?
Stay, stay!
Gnomeo: Good boy.
Gnomeo: Shroom!
Shroooooom!
Duhhhh!
Gnomeo: No!
-First boy: A gnome?
-Second Boy: Yeah, Mate.
Second boy: It looks like your sister.
Lord Redbrick: You left me no choice, Juliet.
I've lost your mother.
I am not going to lose you.
Mmmm.
Hmm?
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.
All right, we've got to
avenge, Gnomeo.
Here's what we're going to do.
Now...
No, not now Shroom.
Right, got it.
Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.
What, what you trying to say?
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?
No, did he jump?
Little Mustafa?
Little Richard, what?
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.
Well what?
Featherstone: Oh, no.
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?
No, little mushroom.
He was a smashed.
I saw it myself.
What, you want I still to follow
you some more. Okay fine.
I go with you, I go.
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.
And where is this well
everyone has fallen into?
Psst.
Oink, oink.
Ready?
Aaaah!
Ooohh.
Hmm?
Benny: Huh, oooh, hello.
Whoa!
Hmm?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
*Upbeat 'Benny and the Jets' playing*
-Never!
-Well brother, maybe it's time for a secret weapon.
-Bring it on.
-TERRAFIRMINATOR!
This one's for Gnomeo!
Announcer roars: Meoooooww!
Benny: Hah, hah, yeah.
Huh?
Come on.
Ohhh!
Miss Montague: Oh, ruddy purse.
Call me.
Gnomeo: So Juliet and me we decided that we
wouldn't carry on this horrible feud.
It was great, but then my
best mate Benny found out.
And Tybalt, who's a right
piece of bad gnome, mate.
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed.
Which wasn't my fault.
Then I was chased down.
Exiled.
Stuck up here on your head.
Far away from, Juliet.
Extraordinary.
Your story,
it does put me in mind of another.
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.
There are remarkable similarities.
What happens?
Did they get back together then?
Get back together?
Um, no.
Not exactly.
What exactly do you mean?
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.
Takes his own life.
She wakes, finds him dead.
Takes her life, both dead!
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!
Author, author!
Hmm?
Gnomeo: What did you say?
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?
Shakespeare: My dear boy, this is a tragedy.
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.
Well I suppose that he could have made
it back in time to prevent disaster.
But I like the whole death part better.
Oh dear.
Aaaaahh!
Whoo hooo!
Featherstone.
One word.
Plastic.
How'd you find me?
Shroom!
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.
Whispers: Not yet.
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head.
What is it, boy?
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.
Featherstone: He's been going on and on
and on since the alley.
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers,
chocolates and strangers....
Juliet's in danger.
No, that's not it.
Juliet's in danger!
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.
I've got to get back to Juliet,
and save her.
That's what he said, but she was
dead before he got home.
Gnomeo distantly shouts: We'll see about that.
Whoa...
Tada!
-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?
This baby is fully equipped.
Equipped for what?
It has settings for edging,
trimming, mulching,
and revenge!
Do it, Benny.
Do anything it takes.
Make them rule the day they destroyed my son.
Unleash the gods of war.
Ah, no, no!
Benny: Yes!
Aaahh!
Ohh.
Oh, no!
Go', blimey!
Oh, no.
ATTACK!
Counter attack!
Counter, counter attack.
Small red wails: Wwww, whoa,
whoooa, whoooa!
Small Reds: Ah me, me,
no, no, no!
Nyah, nyah!
I got one.
Thank you.
Ohhh.
Not, the dolphin.
Oh...ah...oh...no!
Nooooo!
Paris.
Wa...watch out!
Gentlemen, I suggest we put our heads together.
Charge!
Oh, no, no, nooo!
Yee haw!
Cannonball!
Gnomeo: Whoa..oooa
Gnomeo: Right!
Gnomeo: What?
Gnomeo: Juliet!
You're alive.
-Come with me.
-Okay
Gnomeo: Oh, no.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoaaaaa!
Gnomeo!
Terrafirminator: Would you like to complete
destruction now?
Come on, come on, come on!
Lord Redbrick: Oh, Juliet!
Oh, my son. It can't be.
She's going to blow!
Get back, get back.
Gnomes: Huh!
-Huh.
-Huh.
-Huh!
-Huh!
It's no use, go.
Go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Told you so.
Oh, umh!
Oh.
Hmm?
-Lady Blueberry: Huh!
-Lord Redbrick: Oh!
Oh.
Huh?
It's okay, I'm okay.
Ewww!
I'm sorry about your son.
I'm sorry about your daughter.
I was just trying to keep her safe.
And, now...
The whole thing, is my fault.
Our fault.
-This feud.
-Is over.
*Tiiiiki, tiiiki, tiikii, tiki rooom.*
*The tiiiiki, tiiki, tiki, tiiiki, room.*
*The birds and the flowers croon. Tiki, tiki, tiki room.*
I don’t' know about you.
But, I think this ending is much better.
-Mr. Capulet: Good afternoon, witch.
-Miss Montague: Nitwit.
Both: AAAAAHHHH!
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaaaaaaa.*
*I remember when rock was young.*
*Gnomeo and Juliet had so much fun.*
*Holding hands and skimming stones.*
*Had their own gold Chevy
and a place of their own.*
*But the biggest kick they ever got*
*Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock*
*While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock*
*They were hopping and
bopping to the Crocodile Rock, hey!*
*Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still*
*They never knew me a better time
and I guess I never will*
*Hey! Everybody is feeling right
Because we gonna dance all night*
*And the Crocodile Rocking
is something out of sight*
*Yeah, yeah, yeah.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, la, laaaaa.*
*La, la, la, laaaaa.*
*-Laaaaaaaa, la, la, la, la, laaaaa.

*Wedding march*
Oo, thank you.
