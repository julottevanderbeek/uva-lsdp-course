Mr. Kalb.
Dan.
Thanks for
the Lakers tickets.
You bet.
Seats were terrific.
But lm still not going to
advertise in the magazine.
My son-in-law tells me
that people
dont read much anymore.
Too much effort
moving the eyes
back and forth.
So were gonna put
most of our budget
into television,
radio, lnternet.
Okay.
?
What does that mean?
lm not gonna try to
sell you.
Why the hell not?
Youre a salesman.
Yeah.
Just not a very good one,
thats all.
lll say.
But l am gonna
ask you one favor.
Oh, yeah?
lm gonna leave you
an issue of the magazine.
And lm personally
gonna send you
a new one every week.
Now, lll call you
in a few weeks,
and if you want to,
well talk.
Theres a great
article in there
comparing
todays quarterbacks
with Johnny Unitas.
Unitas would kick
their butts.
So, this is
your sales pitch?
lve been with the magazine
for 20 years.
l believe in it.
Well, good for you.
So, are you worried
about all these rumors
that your parent company
is about to be sold?
No, not really.
l dont see how
it would affect us.
Well, hopefully it wont.
You know,
that Teddy K. character
offered to buy my business
a few years ago.
l told him
to go screw himself.
My son-in-law
says lm a dinosaur.
Dont knock dinosaurs.
They ruled the earth
for millions of years.
They mustve been doing
something right
Simply put, we are never
gonna be able to reach
this significant,
untapped market,
until we learn
to think like them.
ln point of fact,
less than .05 percent
of all cell phone users
are under the age
of 5 years old.
Thats why we have
the T-Rex phone
and the Triceratops phone,
and the Pterodactyl phone.
s gonna change
all of that
and each one of these phones
has its own unique ring.
Mommy, Mommy, l want one.
Buy me one for Christmas.
P.F.G., Carter. P.F.G.
Whats P.F.G.?
Pretty fricking good.
Gentlemen, ladies.
l have an announcement
to make:
lts on.
Teddy K. has busted his move
and we are taking over
Waterman Publishing.
Ow!
Lets give it up for Teddy K.
The man has vision.
Hes a maniac.
And, l guess its okay
to tell you Teddy K.
has personally asked me
to go over there
and turn around marketing
in the magazine division.
So, if youll excuse me...
Carry on.
Waterman!
Thats incredible.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mark. Mark,
youre taking me with you.
Tell me you are
taking me with you.
Carter, lm gonna
take that place
and whip its fat ass
into shape.
And...
And?
l want you to come

at
l knew it. l knew it.
The magazines

l mentioned your name
to Teddy K.
He liked what you did
with cell phones.
Oh, hold up,
hold up. lm...
lm sorry.
Teddy K. knows my name?
lm gonna
tell you something.
And l dont want it
to go to your head.
Youre being groomed.
lm being groomed?
Yeah.
Mark. Thank you.
Thank you. l am going to kick
so much ass for you.
lm gonna
take no prisoners.
lll be your
ninja assassin.
Wow. Youre the new me.
No, lm the new me.
Congratulations.
Whats up?
Hey, Dad.
Hey, button.
What are you
still doing awake?
Couldnt sleep.
Cant sleep?
What, were you worried
about something?
No, not really.
Cause, uh,
you know if--if--if you are
worried about something
you can always talk to me
about anything.
Remember? You know
when you were a little girl
we crossed our hearts
and said wed always tell
each other everything.
Be honest with one another.
Yeah.
lm kind of tired.
Hmm. Okay.
We still gonna hit tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.

lm sorry. l thought you said
that you were pregnant.
Yeah.
You cant be pregnant.
Yeah, l can.
lm... l am.
Now, how could
that happen?
Well, l think that
you were there, too.
No, honey.
You know youre done
with all that.
Thats what
Dr. Steinberg said,
but he was wrong.
Youre pregnant?
Yep.
Holy crap.
Holy crap!
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Does it feel like a boy?
Right now it feels
like a stomach flu.
You cant be serious.
Are you serious?
l am serious.
This is fine.
This is fine.
This is...
This is fine.
Yeah.
That means when hes 21,

Um, no.

Do you have any idea

That youre a chimpanzee?
lt means that

You know, things are
fallin into place.
We can buy a bigger house.
We can have kids. You know?
lm sorry.
We got a life going on here!
Carter, its 3:00 a.m.
How much more enthusiasm
are we looking at here?
Honey, lm sorry.
lts just,
Teddy K. knows my name.
Are you even
qualified for this job?
What? Yes. Sure.
Selling cell phones,
selling ad space.
You know,
its all the same crap.
Anyway, its
just a stepping-stone.
Love you.
Love you, too.
The light.
Yep.
Were all gonna get fired.
Well, anythings possible.
No, its not possible.
lts probable.
Did you hear
about this Teddy K. guy?
Hear about him?
Everybodys heard
about him.
l heard hes an albino,
but he covers it with makeup.
Alicia.
Yes. What?
Are you fired?
What? No!
What? Why?
You havent heard

Why? Are you fired?
Uh, lm sorry.
Are--are you saying
lm fired?
No, no, not yet.

Who is Carter Duryea?
Some hotshot from GlobeCom.
This a bummer, Dan.
lts a real bummer.
But youre lucky.
A lot of people are getting
canned immediately
across the company.
Are you getting fired?
Me? No.
This is a joke.
This is a joke.
We have had
our biggest year ever
this year.
My sales team
works incredibly hard.
lm not gonna
put up with this.
Well, you have to
put up with it.
What are you gonna do,
start somewhere new?
Youre not a kid anymore.
You know how tough it is
out there.
People are cutting back.
Theyre not looking
for guys like you
who make a decent salary.
Hey, buddy, l am as pissed off
about this as you are.
So then why are you smiling?
lm not smiling.
Yeah, your lips

Thank you.
Youd have to

Yeah. And, uh, l want to
study creative writing.
And NYU has
such a great program.
But what about SUNY
and the tennis team?
Dad, lm not gonna be
a professional tennis player.
Well, look, sweetheart,
being a writer
is just as tough.
Youre living in the city
and l dont--
l dont like that idea.
This is a lonely place.
You got to have
street smarts.
l dont think
thats such a good idea.
Dad,
l want to try
living in the city.
And
l know that NYU
is more expensive,
but it would be
such a great experience
for me.
Yeah. lt is more expensive.
Yeah.
But
its your education.
Yeah.
Thats the most
important thing, right?
Yeah.
We could manage it.
Dad!
What?
Youre drenched.
Oh. Oh.
l think youre gonna be
very happy here.
Youre really stepping
into an all-star team.
Oh, uh, this is
Morty Wexler.
Morty, Carter Duryea.

Well, its a pleasure

Thats correct.
How old are you?

Twenty-six
and youre my new boss.
Uh, l guess so.
Thats, uh,
thats quite a...
Thats quite a kung-fu grip
you got there, Dan.
Oh, well. So,
what kind of experience
do you have in ad sales?
Uh, well,
lll be honest with you, Dan.
Not much.
How much?
Um...
None.
None.
Thats not much.
But lm a fast learner, Dan.
Hey, now that you know
how old l am,
how old are you?
lm 51 .
Fif... Wow!
Wow. Thats crazy.
Yeah.
Thats like a year older
than my dad, so thats weird.
Oh, well, this is...
This is great.
You two have met.
Are you kidding me?
We are old buddies by now.
Dan, it was a pleasure
to meet you.
Pleasure.
Um, Dan,
you want this door closed?
Or...
Yeah, you can go, um,
go ahead and close it.
So it was
pretty unexpected.
But its like
a pretty big promotion.
Thats fantastic!
Way to go.
So, uh, the Boxster S
has more guts.
Youll sure feel
the extra horsepower.
But if you really wanna go,
ld say

lm gonna go with the 91 1 .

Weve been married...
Come on.
Okay, l know things have been

l mean, God,
l should have taken you
on a real honeymoon.
Well, l should have just
shut that cell phone off.
lt was...
lt was ringing off the hook.
Thats my bad.
You know, this whole thing
is my fault.
Okay, heres the good news.
l can change.
lm gonna change.
This--this has actually been
a very good lesson for me.
Thank you.
Dont try to sell me, Carter.
l love you, Kim.
Kim, l want to
have kids with you.
But l dont want to have kids
with you.
l dont even know
if l want to have kids.
l told you that.
l told you that
on our second date.
Wow, l thought
you were kidding.
Carter, is this really
such a surprise to you?
Are you sleeping
with somebody else?
l was,
but l broke up with him.
Well, it must have been
really rough on him.
Well,
l.
Theyre really excited
to have me back.
Were gonna hear
two heartbeats now.
Mmm-hmm.
That strong, slower one
is yours, mom.
And that... thats your
babys heartbeat.
Oh, my God!
Nice, strong heartbeat.
Thats your new baby, Dan.
Dan?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah.
Thats fantastic.
Uh, lm feeling a little,
uh...
You are having
a little bit of arrhythmia.
Have you been drinking
a lot of caffeine lately?
No.
You under
a lot of stress?
Well, l...
l did sort of
get demoted at work.
Ah.
You what?
Yeah.
l, uh... Well talk.
Another?
Yeah, just keep them coming.
You dont even have to ask.
How was everyones weekend?
Fun?
lm sorry. That was, uh...
Um, ld like to thank everyone
for joining me here.
Teddy K. has an...
has a thing
that what makes GlobeCom great
is the men and women
of GlobeCom.
ls it like a thousand degrees
in here or is it me?
lts like...
lts me.
l have an agenda.
And youre gonna learn this
about me. lm a machine.
What was l saying
about the...
An agenda.
An agenda, l have an agenda.
Which is that l have to
immediately, um,
increase the ad pages here
by 20 percent.
only a startup magazine
can do that.
Yeah, well, l think
this team can do it, Dan.
Um, how?
Well, Morty,
basically what we--
God,
thats an awesome question.
And the answer
is synergy.
We need to team up here.
Yeah, we need to synchronize
and we need to synergize.
Were not alone.
Were not alone.
Were part of
one of the biggest multimedia
and brand name companies
in the known universe, okay?
Lets take advantage
of that, like, uh...
Like...
Krispity Krunch.
Did anyone know that, uh,
one of our sister companies
is Krispity Krunch?
So?
So we talk to
our brothers and sisters
over at Krispity Krunch.
We make a deal
where we supply
sports factoids
to their boxes.
So that when Joe Couch Potato
is sitting there,
hes, uh, snacking,
he looks down,
and what does he see?
Krispity Krunch
sports factoids.
Hes definitely buying
more Krispity Krunch
and not Krunch n Krackle
which, by the way,
looks and tastes
exactly the same.
But guess what?
No sports factoids.
And Krispity Krunch
is so happy they guarantee us
Besides which,
they know if they dont,
Teddy K. is gonna be pissed.
What is that? What am l
talking about here, people?
Synergy.
lsnt that cheating?
No, no. Hell, no.
And, uh, Techline cell phones.
We own Techline cell phones.
Guess what we put
on their browser?
Factoids.
Yes! Factoids! Synergy!
And what else?
Uh, box scores. And ads!
We make a deal
like a 100,000 hits
on the lnternet
has the equivalent value
of one ad page
of our hard copy.
Are you getting it, people?
The magazine has become
just a portal
to a synergized world
of cross-promotion.
Were gonna bust things
wide open.
We are gonna take things
to the next level.
Whos with me?
Who-- whos psyched?
Lou, are you psyched?
Yeah.
Yeah, lm psyched.
Okay.
Alicia, are you psyched?
Absolutely.
Better. This guy. lm sorry,
l dont know your name yet.
Hector.
lm in maintenance.
Thats cool. Hector...
Hector,
l know youre psyched.
lm psyched!
Yes, Hectors psyched!
And if Hectors psyched,
then you know lm psyched.
l am psyched for this team.
Now who else is with me?
Whos psyched?
lm psyched!
Excellent. Who else? Come on.
Who do you think will be
the first to get canned?
My moneys on Dan.
Hes prehistoric.
Sorry, Dan.
Thanks for joining me
for lunch.
You like sushi?
lll just stick
with the teriyaki.
You should try some.
The spicy tuna here is money.
Come here. Get that.
Get that.
Yeah, go fishing, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So l wanted to talk to you,
because, uh,
This is raw.
...an increase
in ad pages is...
Well, its really
only part of the equation
in terms of achieving
the bottom line
my bosses want me to hit.
Understand, Teddy K.
is making cuts
across the board here.
ln point of fact,
l have to cut
$300,000 salary
from the sales team
immediately.
l dont make
that much money, Carter.
l know how much
you make, Dan.
Well,
l wish youd told me
that l was fired
before l ate
the goddamn fish.
Oh, Dan! Dan! Dan!
lm not letting you
go here.
Youre not?
No.
You are an excellent salesman.
You ran a good team.
l think
that you have the potential
to be an awesome wingman here.
An awesome wingman?
B-But, Carter,
l definitely see
the benefit for you
in having an awesome wingman.
But what is
the benefit for me
at this point in my career
of being an awesome wingman?
Well,
one benefit at this point
in your career
is that you get
to keep your job.
Thats a pretty good benefit,
dont you think?
Really? Really!
Are you smiling?
Youre smiling!
This is funny to you.
Guess what? You have no idea
what a nightmare youre about
to step into, my friend.
A-hole!
Well see how soon
this place goes down
the poop chute without me.
Maybe there is justice
in the world.
You enjoying yourselves?
Great.

Okay, l got to go.
Listen, uh,

Okay. Riff them?
Reduction in forces.
Shitcan them.
Right. Um, but l think

So l dont think

Well, sooner or later
everybody has to deal
with reality.
Thanks for coming in.
You, great job today.
Louie, great job.
You want to, uh,
grab a drink or something?
You know, lm
a recovering alcoholic.
Well, better not, then.
How about you, Morty.
Drink?
Uh, ld better

My wife is
slowly poisoning me
to death
and she gets very angry
if lm late.
Okay. Alicia?
Uh, you know what,
l got to go home
and do my hair.
Oh, shut up.
How about you, Dan?
You want to, uh,
grab a drink or something?
lts Sunday.

and have dinner
with my family.
You want to have dinner
with my family?
Oh, yeah! Are you...
Let me, uh, let me just
grab my stuff.
Wait.
Who taught you
how to drive?
No one.
No kidding.
lm home.
Yes.
Oh, this is what
lm talking about.
This is like
a real home-type home.
Hey, sweetheart.
This is Carter Duryea
from the office.
Hello, its nice to meet you.
Hey, Mrs. Foreman.
What a pleasure
to meet you.
Thank you so much
for having me
into your home.
Youre very welcome.
l hope you like baked ziti.
Baked ziti! Uh, this is...
This is so perfect.
That baked ziti.
Thats so...
This is what l need.
Like a-- Like a real,
home-cooked thing.
This is great.
ls there something wrong
with him?
Clearly.
Lets just feed him
and get him the hell
outta here, okay?
Hes really young.
Hes a lot younger than you.
Yeah. Thank you for that.
Thank you.
So, um,
l did the numbers on NYU.
Do you know how expensive
that place is?
Hmm.
Plus living expenses.
Plus Janas orthodonture.
Plus baby costs.
Dont worry about it.
Well, thats not actually
a solution to a problem.
l think we may have to
take out a second mortgage.
Why dont l just go
into the living room
and ask my boss for a raise?
Oh, hey.
l was, uh, just looking
at you and...
And youve...
We never got to...
That day in the elevator.
My names Carter Duryea.
Yeah, l know who you are.
Does my dad
know youre here?
Uh, your dad invited
me over for dinner.
Technically.
Uh, whos that?
Uh, its new boss.
You cans new boss.
Youre too young.
Yeah, and hes also
scared shitless.
Wow, good memory.
And youre too cute
to be Dads boss.
Oh, well, thank you.
l got it!
So, uh, hows it going?
Okay.
So what are you
doing here, really?
Uh, my wife left me,
and todays the anniversary
of our first date.
l found the idea
of going home
to be so depressing
that l kind of leeched
onto your dad
and invited myself over
for dinner.
Wow, youre sort of a
bizarrely honest guy. Huh?
No.
No. Honestly, lm...
lm not.
Just around you,
for some reason.
People would probably say
that lm
an emotionally guarded
anal-retentive asshole.
You wanna play foosball?
Okay.
Cool, lll just change.
Okay.
Good. Yeah.
Do you think Alex could cope
with living in the city
on her own?
Well, lm less worried
about her coping with it
than l am about you.
Yeah, well, frankly,
ld rather keep her
under house arrest
with a homing device
around her ankle.
Then why did you agree to it
without even talking to me?
And why is your
teenage boss here?
And why am l so nauseous?
l hardly had any
morning sickness
the first two times.
Hey, hey, hey!
and lm so sick of it!
Calm down.
Let me have that.
lm not really
that into tennis anymore.
What lm really not into
is being the jock.
You know, its like people
dont even invite me
to their parties
because they think
lm in training or something.
Also, theres this rumor
going around
that lm a lesbian.
Man, that sucks.
Or not. l dont...
Not being a lesbian.
Yeah, well, lm not.
ltd be one thing if l wanted
to go pro and make
a ton of money,
but lm not at that level.

Oh, here.
l got you some pepper spray.
#
#
Oh, how sweet.
Yeah.
And lve installed
surveillance equipment
throughout the dorm.
So lre
getting into trouble.
Okay.
#
##
Be careful.
Okay.
l love you, Dad.
Love you, too.
See you later.
Bye.
Sign here, here, and here.
And youve got
your second mortgage.
Sign, uh, there, there,
and there.
And its official.
Youre divorced.
Okay, two things.
First, Steckle is organizing
a company basketball league.
lm gonna be
sales team captain.
You are my new power forward.
And second,
l heard youre taking
the guys from Rums Jamaica
to the Knicks game
on Wednesday night?
Yeah.
You have to run
that stuff by me, man.
Run it by you?
Theyre my clients.
No, theyre not, Dan.
Theyre GlobeCom clients.
Thatre gonna
be takinem
to the GlobeCom luxury suite.
Well, these arent
luxury suite type of guys.
Dan, everyones
a luxury suite type of guy.
Uh, we cant go there
on Wednesday,
because Teddy K.
is hosting Bill Clinton,
Jay-Z, and Kofi Annan.
Were gonna do it
Thursday.
lll bring them
to a concert.
Look, l gotta get these guys
to up their buy by 18 pages.
We gotta start kicking
some ass here.
lm gonna have to let
some people go.
Why do you say
?
They dont want to go.
Why dont you just say,
?
Because it sounds better.
Not to the person
getting fired, it doesnt.
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
This guy was shot 1 2 times
and pronounced legally dead.
Hence the name.
Someone should tell him
its spelled D-E-A-D.
Theyre afraid to.
Hes got the number one
hit single right now.
Hes a protege of 50 Cent.
Why dont they
just call him ?
What?
still havent improved.
Want you guys to meet
my colleague.
This is Petey
from K-Jam Sneakers.
Hey, hey.
Hmm.
Cross-promotional idea.
You buy a certain amount
of Jamaican rum, boom.
You get a discount
on running shoes. Done.
Yeah, sounds like
a great fit.
Get a lot of drunk people
running around.
Dan. You want to go
get some air?
Yeah.
Be back in a bit.
Word. Hey, not too long.
We got chimichangas
on the way.
#
##
Sorry about the concert.
They wouldnt let me
just get regular seats
for the Knicks game.
No, its okay.
Look, Dan.
lve been instructed
not to advertise
with  anymore.
What?
We were bought out last year
by this company called
Continental Brands.
Apparently, the company
that bought us
and the company
that bought you
are having a feud over
wireless communications
in Europe.
Wireless communications?
What--what the hell
does that have to do
with our business?
Nothing. But we have
this corporate policy now.
Look, lm sorry, Dan.
##
Dan, l have to
fire Louie and Morty.
No, you dont.
l do.
Were gonna get
those ad pages back.
Well get those...
Oh, my God! lts like
you dont get it or something.
That was a huge client.
Steckle gave me
a bottom line here.
l have to increase pages.
We already got Harry, Pete,
and Alicia
on the Ford account.
Mortys the logical choice.
Oh, and the new woman
at Pepsi thinks
that Louies a sexist.
Guess why.
He called her
Hes an idiot.
Come on,
you cant fire these guys.
These are my guys.
Theyve been with me
for eight years.
l hired them
at the same time.
Yeah, l know, Dan.
Thats why
they have huge,
bloated salaries.
And theyre not
pulling their weight.
lm sorry.
Well, lve been here
for 23 years.
My salarys
bigger than theirs.
Why dont you just fire me?
Do you want me to fire you?
Because l could, Dan.
You have
a family that loves you.
You have a kid on the way.
l look at you sometimes
and its like...
You have people
who need you.
Do you really wanna
put them in jeopardy
for Louie and Morty?
##

#  #
#  #
#  #

#  ##
What, are you
living here now?
What... We, uh...
What time is it?
Look, lve been thinking
all night.
And, uh, if it has to be done,
l should be the one to do it.
Guys, l feel really terrible
about what lm about to say.
But lm afraid
youre both being let go.
Let go?
What does that mean?
lt means
youre being fired, Louie.
Believe me,
if l had any choice
in this, l would...
Anyway, l thought
you should hear it from me
because lm the one
who hired you.
Oh. Wait a minute.
Are you being fired, too?
No, no. Uh...
This isnt my decision.
Oh, so its not your decision,
so therefore its not
your fault, right?
l didnt say that.
You know,
this is bullshit.
Louie.
No, no, Morty.
You know something?
l look at you
like a brother.
l wouldve stood in front
of a bus for you,
you piece of shit!
Youve turned into a real
corporate asshole,
you know that, Dan?
Louie.
Do me a favor.
lf you see my friend Dan,
tell him lm looking for him.
Louie!
Dan, what the hell am l
gonna tell my wife?
l mean, she already
wears the pants.
Now shes gonna wear
the tie and jacket, too.
Morty, l am
so very sorry.
l know this must have been
hard for you, Dan.
You were a good boss.
l mean it. You always treated
everyone with respect.
And l...
Look, l appreciate it.
Whats this?
My 360 evaluation.
Uh, you rated yourself,
Yeah.
lm gonna cry.
Donll call you.
Take care, Morty.
Okay, good luck.
Morty.
Oh.
l cant believe this.
Me neither.
You gonna be okay?
lll be okay.
Take care.
No way! What are...
What are you doing here?
Hey! Um,
just reading.
l-lve-- l go to NYU now.
No way!
Yeah.
You did it! Thats...
Thats awesome.
Yeah, yeah.
What about you?
lm renting
an apartment in TriBeCa.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Wow, thats awesome.
Do you drink coffee?
No!
Uh, normally l just hook up
to an lV, actually.
My, you sure can pound back
the caffeine, huh?
ls that why
your leg is shaking like that?
l think it is. Yeah.
Youre not wearing
your wedding band.
Oh. Yeah.
lm now officially
the first person
in my high school class
to get divorced.
Oh, lm sorry.
No, its okay.
When l think about it
honestly,
it was pretty much coming
since our second date.
Hows... How are you?
Hows school going?
lts pretty good.
lts pretty good.
l mean, you know,
its, uh...
its hard to meet new people
as a transfer.
Everybodys got
their own little cliques
and theyre not sure
if they want to
admit one more.
But, uh,
my creative writing classes
are really great.
Oh, yeah,
creative writing?
Yeah.
lve just, uh...
lve always been
interested in stories
and escaping
into other peoples lives.
l guess cause
mine always seems so boring.
lm cursed with
a functional family.
But writing
isnt exactly practical.
So l think
l might double major
in business.
Oh, no. Dont do that.
Stick with
the creative writing.
Strange, you know,
sometimes you seem sort of
bummed out about your career,
but youre so successful.
No, lm not bummed. Uh...
God, my career is pretty much
what l have in my life.
That and a dented Porsche,
right?
Your family
must be really proud of you.
My mom is.
You know, shes...
Shes this kind of hippie.
So shes not really into
the corporate thing.
And my dad left home
when l was 4,
so, you know,
l never really
got to know him.
His family had money,
but, uh,
he was this kind of artist
you know, in quotes,
slash druggy.
Uh, he was in this cult
for a while.
Do you, do you...
Lets get out of here.
Do you want to, like,
take a walk or something?
lm like, uh...
Now that lve told you
my entire life story.
Sure.
Although, uh,
there isnt much left
to talk about.
##
Really?

#  #
#

...wear these giant muumuus

#  #
They were see-through?
Yeah.
Thats cool.

Thank you.
Thank you.
So...
#  #
#  #
Right.

##
You want to see
my dorm room, maybe?
Hey,
dont get the wrong idea.
l--l dont invite guys
to my room often.
Or ever, actually.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
lm having a major
college flashback here.
Aw, come on, old man.
My roommates
out for the night.
Really? Shes, oh...
l was really looking forward
to meeting her.
Yeah, shes only
mildly chemically imbalanced.
Ta-da!
Oh.
Yeah, this is awesome.
Yeah, its okay.
Uh, l heard this rumor
that alcohol
impairs your judgment.
l wish
you werent
so beautiful.
lm not.
No, Alex. You are.
Thank you.
##
Well, it looks like
everythings perfect.
So why are you still talking?
What?
Oh, nothing.
l was just thinking
about how my dad said
he put surveillance cameras
in the building.
Thats...
Thats hilarious.
Where to now?
Youre all going
to the 29th floor.
Oh, great.
l hear theres, uh,
fantastic air-conditioning
on that floor.
Hey, Dan, hows your commute?
Can you believe
were moving offices already?
By the way,
first b-ball game against
the 51st floor corporate VPs.
So, uh... Oh, weird.
l guess thats this floor now.
Whats wrong with you?
Me? Um... Are you...
Nothing. Um, nothing.
Youre acting jumpy.
Did you switch from mocha
to crack?
Whoa, Dan. Thats, uh...
Youre coming off
really paranoid right now.
Youre weirding me out,
buddy.
Crack. Thats...

Oh, thats fair.

You could dunk?
Oh, yeah.

Heads up!
Whoa! Hey.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, great.
Maybe theyll advertise

lm sorry, who are you?
Mark, this is Dan Foreman.
Hes the one
l was telling you about,

that Toys  Us deal.
Oh, Carters being modest.
He did most of the work.
Aw.
Thats beautiful.
Maybe you two

You pussies ready

Oh!

No, no, no.
Do it, baby. Do it, baby.

You mind if l,

You... Yeah.

l want to ask you something.
Okay.
When, uh...
When you were 18,
did you ever return
your parents phone calls?
Uh, well,
they never called.
But, uh, yeah,
lve.
Well, my oldest daughter,
she wont call me back.
And l feel like
going down to NYU
and kidnapping her
so l can stop
worrying about her.
That sounds like
a really bad idea.
Uh, look, Alex seems, um,
from the very brief time
that l met her,
to be pretty savvy.
l dont think you have
to worry about her too much.
Shes a smart,
terrific woman.
Girl. Or smart young lady.
Whatever.
What lm trying to say
is that, uh,
l think she can
probably take care of herself.
Dan, you seem to have
the perfect marriage.
How do you do it?
You just pick the right one
to be in the foxhole with
and then when youre outside
of the foxhole,
you keep your dick
in your pants.
Well, thats poetic.
Oh, my God.
Did she outdo herself or what?
All right. Oh, yeah. Make way.
Coming through
with the cake here.

Oh, hey, Theo. Hows...
Hey, uh,

All right.

Okay.
Are you still glad
you decided not to have
a birthday party?
Yep,

Well, Mom says

She says

She does, does she?
Theyre here. Everybody hide.
You go ahead, sweetheart.

Happy birthday.
Good party.
You look--

She does.
Now, we have

Welcome.
May l help you?
Oh, shit.
Hi,

Are you sleeping with him?
lm going to get you folks
some bread.
Uh, Dan,
this isnt what it looks like.
Oh, yeah?
What does it look like?
Tell me.
What do you think

Well, lm sure it looks like
some kind of sleazy, tawdry...
Alex, l asked you a question.
Are you sleeping with him?
What do you want me to say,
Dad?
Get up.
What?
Get up.
Dad!
Pardon me, sir,
but l dont think

Back off,
before l drop-kick you
across this restaurant.
You are a piece of shit!
Dan, l love her.
You what?
l love her.
l love you.
You love her?
Shes my daughter.
Shes in college.
Shes a college student.
l took out
a fricking second mortgage
so she could go.
Three years ago
she was in braces.
lm sorry.
This guy.
You had to sleep with him?
Dad, l...
Dad...
Dad.
Dad! Wait, lm sorry.
This had nothing
to do with you.
Hes my boss, Alex.
l know.
But it just happened.
We made a deal,
remember?
We made a deal
wed always be honest
with one another.
Dad, l was like 5 years old
when we made that deal.
Yeah.
l liked you better then.
Thats awful.
Thats an awful thing
to say.
Dad, please dont walk away.
l want to talk to you.
Why?
You dont need my advice
about anything.
Hey, you.
Hey.
Hey, Carter.
Wow, thats some shiner.
Thanks.
Maya, could we have
some privacy, please?
Sure. Absolutely.
Sit down.
Hey, can l get you some ice
for that?
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Um, theres no ice.
But the sodas cold.
Oh, thanks.
Look, l wanted to apologize,
uh, for my timing when...
Uh, with the  word.
lt just kind of slipped out.
But lve been thinking
about it a lot lately,
and its how l feel.
lts really important to me--
Oh, thats really sweet.
Well, l mean it.
l know
you probably think you do.
But l-lve been doing
a lot of thinking, too,
and lm
taking
anthropology classes.
And lm doing a double major.
Yeah.
And lm just...
lm really busy.
Yeah.
Uh, lm just not...
lm not ready
for a big commitment.
Yes, thats...
Thatm saying.
Look, when l said
l loved you,
l didnt mean
that l wanted to
interfere in your classes
or, you know, whatever.
lm not talking
about marriage
or anything yet.
Carter. Look.
lve had an amazing time
with you,
and l think
youre a great guy.
But you are on the rebound.
No, lm not.
Carter, you are.
l mean,
it was not that long ago
that your wife left you.
Best thing
that ever happened to me.
Well, thats great.
But then thats a good thing
whether youre with me or not.
l think we should stop
seeing each other.
Alex.
Alex, come on.
l just want you to know
l enjoyed talking to you
more than
maybe anyone
in my entire life.
Thank you.
Me, too.
Dad,
where have you been?
Your cell phone was off.
l tried to call you
like a thousand times.
What happened?
Wheres your mom?
There you are.
Are you okay?
lm fine.
The babys fine.
l had a little scare.
There was some bleeding.
What? What is it?
A placenta previa.
lt sounds bad,
but, uh, its okay.
l just need some rest.
lf anything
ever happened to you,
ld just have to pack it in.
Oh, lm afraid
youre going to be
stuck with me for a while.
Hows she doing?
Shes okay.
You know,
l broke up with Carter.
Because of me?
No. Because of me.
lm sorry l lied to you.
But, you know,
l think you should know
that Carter didnt try
to seduce me
or anything.
lf anything,
it was the other way around.
l really dont want
to hear the details.
l mean,
unless you want to
tell me, and...
No. No, not particularly.
Good.
You must think
lm disgusting.
Disgusting?
Why on earth
would l think that?
l didnt know
that you took out
a second mortgage.
l dont need to go to NYU.
SUNYs fine.
lts fine.
No, no,
you are staying at NYU.
Look, Alex.
Youre a really smart woman.
And you can take care
of yourself.
And lm going to try
and adjust.
You dont have to change,
Dad.
Yeah. l do.
lts going to be okay.
Good.
Hello, how are you? l know.

Those things
can be dangerous.
Keep up the good work.
l wouldnt be surprised
if he announces
another big takeover today.

that there should be

about computers?
Whos going to want to
read that?
Um...
And, uh...

how the way

different kinds of things,
that doesnt mean
we should operate
by our own laws, does it?
Besides which, countries,
at least democratic ones,
they have some obligation
to their citizens,
dont they?
So how do layoffs
and bottom line thinking
fit into that?
Dan Foreman.
You ask
some excellent questions.
Excellent,
excellent questions.
lm glad you asked them.
And lm leaving it to you,
to all of you,
to answer them.
Hmm.
Teddy K.!
Teddy K.! Teddy K.!
Oh, my God, Dan.
Oh, my God.
Good, youre both in here.
You,
lll talk to in a second.
You, have you lost
your frigging mind?
Well, he said
they were excellent questions.
Okay,
you think this is funny.
You think its funny
to disrespect a great man.
Do you know
who you were just talking to
in there?
That was Teddy K.!
Teddy K., God damn it!
Look,
weve been carrying
your fat, bloated salary
for way too long.
l want you
out of this building
within the next
lm going to my office.
lm going to smoke
a nice Cuban cigar
and try to forget
that you ever existed.
You, in my office now.
Mark, dont do that.
Excuse me?
Look.
The guy busts his ass and--
And what?
Nothing. lm sorry.
l just... lf you fire him,
youre going to have to
fire me, too.
Wait.
Let me get something
straight here.
Youre throwing yourself in
with him?
With this useless,
over-the-hill loser?
Think here.
Think about what youre doing,
because if youre not careful,
you could end up like him.
l guess that
that would be okay.
All right.
Then youre fired, too,
you little shit.
Well, thats too bad,
re gonna lose
a huge account that
Dan and lve been working on.
lt was gonna save
the year for us.
Without it,
the magazines
pretty deep in the red.
Really? What account is that?
You think
wed actually tell you?
Youre bluffing.
l dont bluff.
lm not
that good of a salesman.
Yeah, well,
l dont give a crap.
l think Teddy K. will.
See, lm gonna call him
and lm gonna tell him
that you single-handedly drove
his most profitable magazine,
his flagship,
right into the ground.
And hell remember my name.
He likes
what l did with cell phones.
Youve got 24 hours,
or youre both gone.
Any ideas?
One.
You got
all your research?
Yep.
Follow my lead.
So, um,
how are your daughters?
Theyre great. Thanks.
How about
your grandkids?
Uh, theyre fine.
My son-in-law
has just enrolled our oldest,
Ralphy,
in a computer camp,
whatever the hell that is.
Uh, this is my boss,
Carter Duryea.
lts a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Kalb.
You have
a really awesome company
here.
You...
lts a really awesome,
awesome--
Your boss?
He looks more like
your nephew.
Well, lve, uh, certainly been
learning a lot from Dan.
So what happened to your eye?
Thats one of the things
he learned from me.
Are you saying
that you punched him
in the eye? Why?
Well, its...
We dont have to
really go into it here.
No, no, no, please, please.
lm rather curious.
Why did l hit you?
He called me
a dinosaur.
He said
l was out of date.
That ld better
step in line.
So you slugged him?
lt was a fair fight.
Hmm?
Right.
Mr. Kalb,
we have a sister company,
Krispity Krunch,
that l think we could do
a really exciting
cross-promotion with here,
all in the GlobeCom family.
Carter, Carter.
l think that we
could achieve--
Carter, its ok.
Mr. Kalb,
l dont want get into facts
and figures with you today.
You know them already.
l just want to ask you
one question.
What is your hesitation
about advertising
with  magazine?
My hesitation is
that our ad budget
is already overextended.
My son-in-law has put
a lot of money
into cable and online.
And now he wants to plow
even more money back into it.
But...
But what?
But he is such an asshole!
l mean,
l built this business.
l know more about running this
than he ever will.
So, yeah.
lm gonna make a major ad buy
in your magazine.
And then lm gonna restructure
the whole damn ad campaign.
That is great news.
Thank you, Mr. Kalb.
Oh. Thank... Yes.
Thank you so much, sir.
You know, l dont give a shit
about Krispity Krunch.
Lets just stick
with the magazine, okay?
You really slugged him?
Yeah. Carter.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that was amazing.
That was unbelievable!
God,
that was actually fun.
What Kalb
really needed to see
was an old fart
who beat the crap out of
a young punk half his age.
And you know
what the best thing is?
lts the right thing to do.
lt will improve
his business.
Wow, you actually, uh...
You actually
believe in this stuff, huh?
Of course l do.
Why else would l do it?
Hmm?
Hey, Dan. Where you been?
Los Angeles.
We made
a huge sale.
Congratulations.
So did Teddy K.
He sold the company
to CalCor Communications.
Mark! What happened?
l thought you said
Teddy K. was buying
another company.
Thats what they told me,
but he sold us.
lm out.
Wait, youre out?
Yeah.
Theyre reorganizing
the whole company.
Youre out, too.
l think youre in.
lm in what?
Your old job.
What?
Running the department?
Thats the rumor.
The whole thing
seems so arbitrary.
l feel used.
Yeah.
Kind of tough to know
youre replaceable, huh?
lm sorry
you lost your jobs.

Hey, Dan.
Hey, Carter.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
Nice office.
Yeah.
So.
How have you been
the last month?
lve been good.
Really good.
lts a little weird, uh,
not having to get up,
go to work in the morning.
Thats why
l want to talk to you.
l want to offer you a job.
l know
we definitely had our moments.
But l think
youre a good manager
and a good salesman.
And l want you to come here
and be my second-in-command.
Wow, Dan.
Uh, l...
l really appreciate that.
Uh, more than you know.
And l...
l think
if l really want to do this
for a living,
theres no one
l could learn from
more than you. But l...
Look, l dont know what
l want to do with my life.
l know that l want it
to mean something to me
the way that
this means something to you.
Oh.
God,
do you think lm being stupid?
No. No. l...
l think that sounds right.
So hows the family?
Uh, Anns fine.
Uh, the babys coming
Tuesday after next Tuesday.
Oh.
lts a cesarean.
Dan, thats amazing.
Yeah, it is.
And, uh,
both girls are...
Theyre doing well.
Good.
Please, uh,
give them all my best.
Yeah.
Dan.
Thank you.
For what?
For...
l guess
for showing me a few things.
No one ever really
took the time to
give me a hard time before.
Or teach me anything
that was
actually worth learning.
All right.
Now listen, Carter.
l want to tell you something.
Youre going to be okay.
You think so?
Yeah. l know it.
Youre a good man.
Dont be a stranger.
Morty?
Hey!
Youre back!
Yeah, back in the saddle.
And look at you.
Youre...
You look like
a delivery guy.
Oh, do you know
Dans daughter Alex?
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
lm surprising my dad.
Tennis.
Alex is
a fantastic tennis player.
She was a junior champ, right?
Really? Oh, youre into...
Youre into tennis, huh?
Yeah.
How is everything?
Good. Really...
Really good.
Um, lm leaving town,
actually.
l think
lm going to try teaching
or, um,
maybe open an Awapuhi store.
l dont know. Uh...
How are you doing?
Good. Very good.
lve been working on
some short stories.
Oh. Thats awesome.
Well, l got a raise.
Dan got me a raise.
Which is a good thing,
because my wife
just got laid off.
Timings everything in life,
right?
Right.
Well, good seeing you.
Take care, Carter.
Yeah.
Look, it was really great
seeing both you guys.
You, too, Carter. lt was...
lt was really good to see you.
Bye.
Hi, guys.

Yes?
Wel, lm delighted to say
that you have a baby sister.
