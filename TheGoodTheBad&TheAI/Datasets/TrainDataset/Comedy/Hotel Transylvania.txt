AARRGHH!!
Ever since she was born,
I wanted to protect my little Ghoul...
So I created a place
where all monsters could be safe...
from them !
Humans hate us !
They're vicious
and they're very loud !
THIS AUTUMN
Dad, everyone's here is ancient.
N-27.
N-27
I wanna go out and see the world.
Woa woa woa, honey, you're too young!
I'm 118 years old.
Don't give me the powdy bat face.
This is Hotel Transylvania.
All our monster friends are right here!
The Mummy.
Wayne the wolf.
Yeah, it's a mess back there.
And your uncle Frank's
dropping in too.
Housekeeping!
AN UNINVITED GUEST
Hello?
A human!
How did you find this place?
Oh, I was just mountain climbing
with some dudes
and heard this story
about an awesome castle.
Speaking of awesome,
that cape thing is killing it!
A MONSTER PROBLEM
Look at these cool costumes!
Check it out, I'm a Franken-homie !
Wow, what's your name?
My name is Mavis.
Drac's daughter is in love with...
A Human !
Go to a corner, you're in a time-out!
I'm a grown man!
Seriously, Dad.
PACK YOUR BAGS
- You are coming with us.
- I'm staying!
Oh! Why did that hurt me?
GET AWAY
Out of the way, grand-pa!
Stay away from my daughter!
REST IN PEACE
I think your Dad's
really starting to like me.
Hi...
Hotel Transylvania
Now go and never return.
Wait. Never return to the hotel?
I've just used my powers
to erase your memory.
I looked straight into your eyes!
- Oh, maybe it's the contact lenses.
- Your what?
Yeah, let me just try and
get them out real quick.
Oh, that is the most disgusting
thing that I've ever seen!
I almost got it.
