The breakup of the Soviet Empire,
culminating in the
crumbling of the Berlin Wall,
is one of the great events
of world history.
There were many heroes in this battle,
but to Charlie Wilson must go this
special recognition.
Just thirteen years ago
the Soviet Army appeared to be invincible.
But Charlie, undeterred,
engineered an almost whole bodied
world that weakened
the Communist Empire.
Without Charlie, history would be hugely
and sadly different.
And so for the first time,
a civilian is being given
our highest recognition,
that of an "Honored Colleague".
Ladies and gentlemen of
the clandestine services,
Congressman Charles Wilson.
It'd be like "Dallas".
You are right.
- You know what I'm sayin'?
It'd be like "Dallas", but set in Washington.
Yeah.
You shouldn't say it
like that.
What I meant...
"Dallas" set in Washington DC.
About people,
power, the national monuments...
the glamour, the power...
It's like Dallas or Paris?
except that it's in Washington.
Let's talk to Charlie about that.
Charlie... it's like "Dallas",
but in Washington.
With Crystal in the starrin' role?
Yeah.
Tell me when to watch.
I'll make sure I'm home.
You don't think I can make it happen?
I don't know anything about
how any of that works.
I do.
He said that you would listen to him,
that's why we're here.
Isn't it routinely against honor
rules to offer network programs
to people who haven't
acted professionally before?
Crystal appeared on the
cover of Playboy, Charlie.
Well, I guess that's just the same thing.
Would you take this seriously, please?
I'm taken' it seriously.
Give me something to drink.
What's Dan Rather wearin' there?
- What?
- Dan Rather. What's he wearing?
You're watching TV?
Why'd he shave?
Who else is that?
Excuse me, hey.
Hey you, can you turn that up?
Can you just turn up the volume,
on the TV?
I'm completely high.
Yeah, well, OK.
You know, can you just grab the remote
there and find the volume button?
Charlie, are we going to do business?
Dan Rather is wearing a turban,
don't you want to watch?
He is doing some thing on India.
No, it's Afghanistan.
Appreciate it.
You have ammunition for it?
He has three, but does he have ammunition?
He's talking to the Mujahideen.
Priests?
Mujahideen. It means holy warriors.
Priests...
How the hell am I supposed to know.
Come on.
America seems to be sleeping. It does not seem to
realize that if Afghanistan falls
and the Russians reach the Gulf,
it will be bad for the United States as well.
Me and my friend want to know.
What do you do for a living?
I'm not a police officer,
if that's what you're asking.
No, we don't meet
many guys here who know
about the world
and likes to party.
I'm a member of the US
House of Representatives.
I'm sorry?
I'm a Congressman.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm serious.
I'm Charlie Wilson.
I represent the Texas Secon...
And this is Crystal Lee and this is Paul Brown.
What are your names?
Stacy.
Stacy?
Kelly.
Kelly?
Glad to meet you both.
If you are a Congressman, should you
be in here with strippers and booze?
I'm not a stripper.
I am.
I am too.
See? They were talking
about themselves.
You know you do have a point there.
Maybe I really should get goin'.
Charlie, I need twenty-nine thousand
dollars to make this happen.
You know I can make it happen,
and you know you want it.
Hey, who wants to take a ride
with me to the airport?
They say if they get weapons...
from us or anyone
else in the free world,
they will win.
Yes, I'm with Congressman
Charles Wilson and Crystal Lee...
I wish it were not so.
They will do a program on
Washington? I never saw.
Not me.
We have a suite another night.
Should I go back?
No.
There can be another night?
Stay another night.
I can't.
- I have a vote.
- Something important?
Yes.
What are we talking about?
It is a non-binding resolution
expressing the sense of the Congress
that the Department of
Defense should continue to do
what's necessary to support
the Boy Scouts of America.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Come on Charlie, call in the vote.
I need an answer on this
Crystal thing as soon as possible.
First, I'd appreciate it if you
didn't throw my name around quite so much.
From time to time, I use it
myself and I need it in good condition.
Second, I'm from Lufkin, Texas, and
I'm the son of a common bookkeeper,
and I that take home
about 700 bucks a week.
And I pay alimony, so the
idea that I got twenty-nine
thousand dollars in the
bank is pretty hysterical.
That's it.
I hope your ideas work.
Chrystal,
will you look during the week.
Stacey and Kelly, nice to meet you both.
They live here?
Yes.
Don't forget to vote.
Bye. Love you.
I have to go.
- Oh, that's for you.
- Thank you, sir.
Bye!
I love Las Vegas.
Okay, what else?
The man you wanted
is sitting in the office.
Yeah, I thought we could talk.
He wants to talk to you about a crèche.
What, a Nativity scene
of the baby Jesus?
It's on public property and the city
is making them move it.
Shoot, I thought he was just coming
to get his picture took.
Hello Congressman, my name is Jack Donnelly,
do you have moment, Sir?
Sure.
Tip asked me to talk to you.
OK, he wants me to talk to you
about John Russell.
Oh yeah?
The prosecutor is going to go after him.
They will not find anything.
John Russell is as clean as
my mother's kitchen floor.
Yeah but Tip would like to put you
on the Ethics Committee just the same.
You're kidding?
No.
Oh Jesus, nearly everybody in town knows
that I'm on the other side of the issue.
Ethics?
Yeah.
Well, the Speaker would like
to put you on the Ethics Committee anyway.
Ok.
Anyone asks what the hell I'm doin' on
the Ethics Committee just tell them
I like chasing women and drinking whisky,
and speaking trouble like a Representative.
It has my vote.
Exactly.
Tip said that he'll return the favor.
Tuesday, right?
Right, Tuesday.
So, if anything comes up will you let
me speak with him about it, please
Yes.
Yes.
I'd like to be on the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.
Charlie!
Sorry?
It turns out..
Congress approves the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center,
it's a great place to take a date
and I can never get tickets.
Consider it done.
Excellent.
You're a phony.
Let's take a few minutes and
see what's going on in this world.
What can't you arrange for newspapers
like everybody else?
Well, every thing is productive
and I like today's news today
and that makes me one
day smarter than you
and this could help you as well.
No thank you.
Don't you think its a little crazy?
"Pan Am and Eastern are lower on defense"
You know what I know.
What's so crazy?
That you want on the Kennedy so you can get
free tickets to the Royal Ballet?
Wait.
What?
A story of Kabul.
Pakistan?
Afghanistan.
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Egypt.
Jim Van Wagenen is our point man
for Agriculture and Defense Subcommittee?
Yeah.
Tell him come to our office
as soon as possible.
I already voted in this?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Boy Scouts.
Uh-huh.
Jim Van Wagenen, get him.
And show him that wire.
Yes sir.
Charlie'll probably be here in a moment.
He's just come up for a vote.
I'm sure it's important.
No, not really.
Can you reschedule this?
Office of Charlie Wilson,
good morning.
It is.
How are you?
Miss.
Yes sir.
It seems to me that looking around,
its almost all women workin' here.
And they all are very beautiful.
Is this common?
Congressman Wilson has an expression...
He says that you can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits.
Well, that's charming.
Larry.
Congressman.
No, no, no, for five thousand dollars
every two years, you can call me Charlie.
For ten thousand you can call Betty Sue
and I'll clean out your rain gutters.
This is my daughter, Jane.
Charlie Wilson's office.
Welcome to the United States Congress.
I'm gonna to talk to your daddy
for a couple of  seconds.
Larry, we uh... get you a drink?
It's ten o'clock in the morning!
Fair enough.
Grab a seat.
Now this situation with the crèche,
I know all about it.
Wilson...
Every seven years since when
the world was young,
Uh-huh
the Firehouse in Nacogdoches Township
has displayed a crèche.
Um-hmm
Now the ACLU filed a suit
against the Township for displaying
a religious ceremony on public property.
Huh.
It's Christmas time, it's crèche. I can
understand if it we were in gosh darn Scarsdale,
but this is East Texas and
I want to know who we're offendin'
except for two lawyers from the ACLU.
It's a terror thing to understand
and a complicated question.
Let me make this suggestion though.
There's a church about a block
and half from that firehouse,
the First Baptist Church of Nacogdoches,
they got a beautiful rollin' lawn...
This is a Christian country Charlie,
founded on Christian values.
Sure.
We mock a lot of things to
worship as they wish,
but when we cannot put a Nativity
scene in front of the firehouse
at Christmas time in
Nacogdoches Township,
something's gone terribly wrong.
That's not really true, Larry.
I mean, you could move that
crèche over to that church,
and everything's just fine.
That's not the point.
Ok, why don't we just
go back to the beginning?
What can I do for you?
You can intervene in the case.
Intervene?
How?
You appointed the Judge.
I don't appoint judges,
I just made a recommendation
to the President.
Uh-huh,
I think you and I
both know what that means.
I cannot just call up a Judge
and tell him what to do.
Why?
Because it's against a shitload
of really good laws, Gary.
Larry.
Oh, Larry.
I gotta go to talk to this
guy out here for a second.
Will you excuse me.
By the way, I love Jesus Christ
and his mother Mary
as much as anybody,
about 38 churches
you could move that crèche to
and everyone would be happy.
Call me.
Ok.
Hello, how are you?
Want a cup of coffee, something to drink?
Ok.
Jim.
You see AP story I copied you?
Yeah, with respect to Kabul.
He saw the Dan Rather report last night?
Yeah.
Tell me somethin',
what is the Committee's budget
for covert ops against
communist activities in Afghanistan?
- Total?
- Total.
It's five million.
They can't shoot down helicopters
for five million dollars.
No.
We already tried that
It's like throwing rocks.
Get everybody together for me, will ya?
And double it.
I'm sorry, sir?
The covert ops budget,
double it.
Okay.
It won't be much longer, okay?
Thank you.
Here's what I'm gonna do, Larry...
Charlie Wilson's office.
Maybe in 20 minutes.
He's in meeting.
Sure.
And so, wrote in a report I was the
the best officer who he ever served at Sea with.
And the worst officer that he ever
served with in Port.
Can you figure that out?
I graduated from Annapolis
with the second most demerits
of any mid-shipmen in the
history of the Naval Academy.
Who had the most?
I want to speak with him.
It's hotter here
than it is in Nacogdoches.
I hope you don't mind,
I took off my hot clothes.
I'm just going to have to live with that, Jane.
Come on, I want to show you the
best view in the business.
Want a cigarette?
No, I have this.
- I like both.
- It must be great being mixed.
- They say it is.
The Iwo Jima Memorial...
The Lincoln Center...
The Washington Monument...
Jefferson Memorial, the Ponte Bridge, and...
the Pentagon.
- Ah, yes the Pentagon...
- That is the Pentagon...
And now I'll show you the second
best woman in the district.
Ok.
That was predictable.
I have to go for a second.
Hello.
What did you do today,
is something extraordinary.
Who is this?
It's Joanne.
Joanne.
Ah, so nice speaking to you,
can I call you back in a little bit?
Is Ronald Reagan in
your bedroom right now?
No.
Then I'm considerably
more important than whoever it is.
Do you want me to leave?
No, this is just going to be a second or two.
Okay, I am all yours.
What did I do that was so extraordinary?
Double it.
Now you told me you didn't have a girlfriend.
What?
You told Jim Van Wagenen to double it.
Oh shit Joanne, I don't know
what you are talking about,
and if I did, it's classified.
I'd wonder where you got your
information from the subcommittee.
You can't hide anything...
It's a really a matter of National Security.
Can't help but...
I'm really Sorry.
Hold on.
I understand, Laurez told me
you didn't have a girlfriend.
I don't, this isn't my girlfriend,
but the sixth wealthiest woman in Texas.
But she's still pretty good.
Okay, so.
A friend of mine has
made a terrific movie
about the need for
American aid to Afghanistan.
Need for ammo?
Yeah. I'm gonna run this movie Friday night
at my house, I want you to be there.
You've never been to my house, Charlie.
You really want me to come to
Houston to see a movie.
There'll be women with bells on.
See you Friday.
Yes Ma'am.
Hey.
Hey.
Thank you.
Ok, so I know it was difficult for
you to come here hat in hand.
It's not the kind of... upbringing,
I guess is the word I was looking for.
It's not the kind of man
you are.  I understand that.
I'm not looking to humiliate you
or attack your pride in any way
so why don't you just apologise.
We'll call it water over the dam
and we'll go about our business.
Excuse me,
what the fuck?
What?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Claire George said you
were coming in here to apologise.
Na, I was supposed to come to in here to
see if you would apologise to me.
According to whom?
Claire George.
You told me to fuck myself,
I'm supposed to apologise to you?
Oh, so the water goes over a dam and under a bridge,
you pompous schoolboy
Clearly, there's been a mis-communication
between Claire George and somebody.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Fine.
I have no fuckin' idea who this guy is.
He is here to fix the glass
you broke last time you were here.
Can you give us a second?
You tell me to fuck myself
and I'm supposed to apologise?
You break my window, I'm
supposed to apologise?
The Helsinki job was mine!
The Helsinki job wasn't yours.
If it was yours you'd be in Helsinki now.
Alan Wolf promised me.
Alan Wolf is no longer here.
Alan Wolf is no longer the Director
of European Operations.
He did not make those appointments.
The promises were made.
Not by me.
I've been with the company
for twenty-four years.
I was posted in Greece for fifteen.
Popideau wins that election
and I don't have the junta taken prisoner.
I've advised an army,
I've disarmed champions of communism,
I've spent the last three years
learning Finnish,
which will come in handy here in Virginia
and I've never even seen Helsinki.
So I want to know why I'm not
going to be Helsinki Station Chief?
You're coarse.
Excuse me?
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.
You don't have them.
Is that right?
That is right.
I don't know why the
hell they didn't fire you,
when you broke my fucking window!
Oh, sure you do, Gravely.
Look, Gust...
They're talking about our seance in here
and you know I know.
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.
Yeah, yeah dignify it or in your ass
the Jefferson tower with 12:10
But let me ask you,
the 3000 agents Turner fired,
was that because of their
lack of diplomatic skills as well?
You're going to Admiral Stanfield Turner?
Yeah, 3000 agents, each and
every God Damn one of them 1st or 2nd
generation Americans, not because they
lacked the proper diplomatic skills.
But it was Turner that thought
it was a good idea that the spies
should speak the same language as the
people they were fucking spying on.
Well, I'm sorry,
but you can hardly blame the Director
for questioning the loyalty
of America people who are just barely
Americans in the first place.
Yeah, well I'll take a moment to review
the several ways you're a douche-bag.
Get the fuck out of my office!
Yes sir.
This will end your career, asshole.
Yes sir.
My friend, I'm gonna...
need this for a second.
God Damn it!
My loyalty...
For twenty-four years, people
have been trying to kill me.
People who know how.
Now you think that just
because my dad was a Greek
soda pop maker,
or you think just because
I'm an American spy...
go fuck yourself,
you fuckin' child!
How was I?
There is a woman in Pennsylvania,
named Nitza.
She thinks she's a witch.
She offered to put a curse on
Gravely for me.
Yeah.
She uh, asked me if I want a
professional curse or a health curse.
A health curse I can do right away,
but a professional curse takes longer.
I'm uncomfortable about that.
You get the brownie?
- No, you...
I got ya.
Transcripts of phone conversations
between French and German generals
ordering their office space
in NATO Headquarters.
Analyzing wire taps of
communications in New Zealand.
Historically a hotbed of Anti-American activity.
Nobody can come near me.
Even the weebs.
You know with that typical police officer,
he walks into his boss's office
and winds up in a bucket of shit.
Twice.
I just told ya I met a
witch in Pennsylvania and
I already was going to put a
curse on Henry Gravely this morning.
Does that sound like
a typical police officer?
No.
Then lets assume that I'm not.
If you're really not doing anything wrong,
then I'm sure you can work it out.
What do you do?
Killing Russians.
Our next slave girl
is a Texas homegrown, Ashley Winslow.
Ashley is a Playboy beauty and comes from
Delta Delta Delta,
So hold up your cards if you want to bid.
So who wants to bid?...
Oh my gosh, she is a knockout.
No, she's just charged up.
No, she is a neat one, Charlie.
Oh, Joanne.
She's a direct descendant of
George Washington's sister.
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.
Oh, and Miss Cotton bowl.
Federal and local television options.
"Pakistan draws the right council of
Texas ", how's that for a title?
This is a hotbed of
Anti-Communist fanatics.
They're not all from Right Wing.
What are they?
Well, they're local family.
What are you doing with this woman?
You haven't heard me talk
about the former Miss Cotton bowl?
You are unbelievable.
We will, you will like. What is
Here is release the woman.
And what better way than with
a slave girl auction?
Charlie?
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
No problem, Joanne.
This is Bonnie Bach.
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Herring. Wonderful party.
Why don't you give us a few minutes?
Sure.
Oh Bonnie, could I ask you for a
Bombay Martini, very dry?
Oh, I'm not a slave girl actually, I'm
the Congressman's Administrative Assistant.
And how wonderful for you!
Yes.
No ice please.
And you can go.
Certainly.
She doesn't like me.
Everybody likes you.
She's a liberal.
I'm liberal.
Not where it counts.
Have you seen the house?
Well, I've seen the downstairs.
What's upstairs?
Fourteen bedrooms.
Let's have a look.
What'd you think of the film?
What we saw?
The reason for the party, yes.
I'm not an expert in the field,
but the production quality seemed amateurish.
I'm not submitting it
for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie.
You know what I am talking about.
Well, as a member of
the Defense Subcommittee, I wondered
if the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?
The problem is my
government is aware of it.
I was wondering if they were
thinking of doing anything
about it other than a
Boycotting the Olympics this year.
I think that agreeing with the pathetic response
is the greatest National Security
threat this nation has faced
since the Cuban missiles crisis.
Well, I don't think
making more movies about it
is going do the trick,
if that's what you're asking.
You think not?
Tell me, how much power do you have
as a member of the subcommittee?
Which one, I'm on two?
Foreign Ops.
Eight Members and myself hand
out eleven billion in promises.
And what about the
Defense Subcommittee?
What about it?
The funds are unlimited.
Yes.
Would you like to see my room?
Yes.
So, unless I'm wrong,
and that would be unusual for me,
you oversee the aid section of the State Department,
the Pentagon and the CIA.
You meet in a sound proof room
underneath the Capitol.
And you design or direct a secret and unlimited
budget for the three agencies
that are needed
to conduct a covert war.
Isn't that right?
I also have seats in the Kennedy Center.
Isn't that how you were
able to double the CIA budget
for advisory personnel to
Afghanistan just by saying so?
Why are you only asking me questions
you already know the answers to.
Why is Congress is sayin' one thing
and doing nothin'.
We're traditional.
Come here.
Ok.
I don't understand the energy that
women have after sex.
After a while, they bake a pie,
Charlie?
Yes, Ma'am
Why is the CIA runnin' a
fake war in Afghanistan?
They do everything they can.
They're doin' it badly.
The CIA is arming the Mujahideen,
where do you think
they get their weapons?
They're arming them
with 12.7 mm Dushkas,
Which would be good, except ....
the Soviets have specifically
armor plated their helicopters to
deflect a 12.7 mm shell.
They sold Pakistan 16's,
but they didn't give them enough
ammo to shoot down the radar.
If this were a real war,
they would just
show up and outline the
communist threat the way
they did in El Salvador.
If this were a real war,
there'd be a national bipartisan commission...
on Afghanistan,
headed by Henry Kissinger,
the way they did in Central America.
If it were a real war,
Congress would authorize
twenty-four million dollars in
covert operations,
the way they did in Nicaragua.
If it were a real war...
You are the sexiest woman ever.
I'm not kidding. You are Helen of Troy.
You patronizing me?
What do you want me to do, Joanne?
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to save Afghanistan
for the Afghans.
I want you to deliver such a
crushing defeat for the Soviets
that Communism crumbles and in so doing,
end the Cold War
I'm sorry, I'd do it too,
but I got some Dairy Queen
problems and now you know...
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.
Exactly what do you want me to do?
Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.
Zia.
Muhammad Zia Ul-Haq.
He's the President of Pakistan.
I've already arranged it
You arranged a meeting between me
and the President of Pakistan?
Yes.
You're going to Israel next
week so we need to figure out
how it'll be a last minute adjustment and
we'll just add Pakistan to this trip.
I meet with the President?
And convince you that it's
a Christian imperative to
the let the Afghans rid
their country of Communism.
Ok, it's unlikely the President
of Pakistan is a Christian,
but how am I going to do this, Joanne.
'Cuz you saved my ass
from the pro-lifers
and I owe you my seat in Congress,
and you presently look very good naked.
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.
How many Jews do you
have in your district?
Un...seven,
but Congressmen aren't elected by voters,
they're elected by contributers,
and I'm wondering... wondering
about New York, Florida,
'cause I'm one of
Israel's guys on the Hill.
I don't know how they're
gonna feel about me taking 'em a card...
Well, that's your problem.
Yes it is.
You have this war and win it, Charlie.
Everything possible is on the line. Even you and me.
I was afraid you were going to said that.
Well, I guess it ain't be twice tonight.
Well, I guess somebody can't count.
Oh god, I'm real tired and beat.
- Congressman, Congressman.
- Mr. President.
Joanne Herring speaks very highly of you.
Thank you, Sir
These are two of my greatest advisers
covering the problem of Soviet.
This is the Brigadier Rashid.
How do you do?
-- Very happy.
Colonel Mahmood.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.
Please sit down.
You must be exhausted,
let me get you a ginball.
Actually, I'd love a glass of ice, with
any kind of whisky... Rye, Canadian.
I'm sorry Congressman, we don't have
alcohol in the Presidential Palace.
Of course you don't.
I apologize.
Fruit juice?
I bet a lot of people
made that mistake.
No.
Ok.
Brigadier.
So, you understand the situation
on our border?
Yes sir, I think I do,
and I think it's terrible.
And I know I speak for all the people in
the Texas Second Congressional District,
when I say that our thoughts
and prayers are with you.
All the people of the Texas Second
Congressional District you represent?
Yes it is.
Three million Afghan refugees
are living like livestock.
And other two million have fled into Iran.
And it's just what the doctor's ordered for Iran,
don't you think.
People dying by tens of thousands.
And those that aren't are crossing
into Pakistan every day.
Would you like to know how many?
northwest frontier province.
So, I had asked me
That the
your State Department
would someone here
who things he understands the problem.
But I don't think that Representative of the
Texas Second Congressional District
understands very well the subject.
Well, I came not representing them. Vim
At the request of a friend in Houston.
So this is a courtesy call.
I don't need courtesy. I need
airplanes, guns and money.
Well, we just doubled
the CIA budget for covert ops.
From five to ten million?
That's right.
It was a joke.
No.
Is that meant to be a funny joke?
No sir.
What they're saying is $10 million for
the US to fight the Russian army,
I can only figure that the
Call this sarcasm here sir,
but let me be clear,
The United States is eager to assist you.
No, you're not.
You're not.
Absolutely not.
I went to Oxford and I know
what that word means.
The US is not "eager" to assist us.
I not offended, we offered to sell you
F15's, and you didn't want 'em.
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.
To hell with that.
And this is typical of
Relation to ...
Americans when it comes to fighting the Soviets.
To hell with it!
You sell us the planes,
but not the radar.
In offering arms of the 1st World War,
while Soviet helicopters
are killing everything they can find,
people, animals, food supplies.
To hell with it.
The Soviets said that we would give the radar
so that's why they said , "to hell with it."
And I... I understood.
Also, the arms and funding
should go through us.
I'm sorry?
That's a big part of the problem.
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.
We have experience
with warfare of this kind.
And you the CIA has an
unimpressive record.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
They missed 130,000 Soviet soldiers
walking just walking in Afghanistan.
Yeah, we were wrapped up.
I would say so.
Well, I don't want to use up
any more of your possible time.
I will uh, take your message back
to my Committee Chairman and
we will give it our fullest attention.
Let me walk you to the door.
I read about you before you came here.
I learned that you are a man
of many character flaws.
I am.
But I also learned that you  never
promise anything that cannot deliver.
No I don't, Mr. President.
Then promise me this.
Go take a shower and see the refugees camps.
Right now, today.
Have a shower, and see
with your own eyes.
I have a helicopter waiting.
Alright. I'll do it.
Thank Mr. Congressman.
Mr. President.
Alright, lets go.
How did it go?
There were three of them.
It was like I was receiving punches from all sides.
He's pretty much a rock bottom man and
he told me he was a qualified man behind
his predecessor in a military coup.
Can we go home now?
No, no, we have to
make one more stop.
There are about 350 people
in three small villages.
But uh, instead of killing all at once,
the Russians have made the parents watch
as they slit the throats
of their children.
And so the Russians
gathered all the defenders
into the center of the village
then played honor with them
with their tanks.
I saw something shining on the ground,
I thought it was a toy.
When I went to grab it,
exploded in my hand.
I should have known.
Because last year my brother
tried to pick up a piece of candy,
And it cut him in half.
It takes more work take care of a
wounded child, than it does an adult.
So when the Russians cover
the field with toy bombs,
I don't see why held to the war
act to take care of the children.
You like them?
Make you look a like a bug.
They're beautiful.
How many children you have?
He had 6.
What we want to be when they grow up?
Hi, Congressman Wilson
We have an invitation
with the Station Chief.
Down the hall,
second door to the left.
Look sir, we met the delegation
and we give courtesy briefings
We've been delayed?
We don't have a whole
lot of time anyway, so...
Fuck your contract,
I'm on Defense Appropriations and I'm catching
a plane back to Washington
in just a few minutes now.
I need a full classified
briefing right now!
The 40th army is garrisoned
in the cities and at the airports.
The 7th and 8th divisions are in Kabul.
A 18th in Bazard.
The 4th Armored is in...
Manage anything in government?
I'm sorry?
They control any government themselves?
Soviet advisers have appropriated
the Afghan Intel Service and other ministries.
What ministries?
All of them.
Anyway, the 4th Armored covers
Bagram Air Base, the 7th Armored...
Do we need to be shootin'
down these helicopters?
Sorry?
The helicopters, why not send in someone
who can shoot down the helicopters?
The helicopters are a problem.
You think?
Congressman...
They're shooting at Soviet gunships
with Enfield rifles that's basically not cutting it.
The Soviet hides gunships with specialty
armor modified to diffuse those bullets.
Yeah, I know, I know.
So you tell me what you need to shoot them down.
What do you mean?
Tell me what you need.
You understand what I'm saying?
You tell me what you need and
I will go about getting it for you.
Congressman,
I appreciate your generosity,
but a sudden influx of
money and modern weaponry
would draw attention.
What?
A sudden influx of money ...
It would call attention?
Yeah.
I don't know what this means.
This is the Cold War,
everybody knows about it.
Should I continue with the briefing?
Have you been to these refugee camps?
Have you listened to their stories?
Congressman,
I'm required to give you a briefing.
Should I continue?
No, thank you.
You know, I had a neighbor
when I was growing up,
whose name came right out of Dickens.
Mr. Charles Hazard
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighbourhood dogs
messing up his flower beds.
One day I hear a bunch of
yelling across the street, so I ran over
to Mr. Hazard's
and there were about 15 grownups
standing around my dog.
Teddy was wriggling on the ground,
in obvious agony.
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.
Mr. Hazard ground glass bottle
and put it in a bowl of dog food and gave it to him.
What did you do?
Well, I got some gasoline and
burned down his flower bed.
But that wasn't satisfying enough.
And then I remembered
that Mr. Hazard was
an elected official.
He was on the town council.
He re-elects every two years,
it was a foregone conclusion.
So, come election day,
I drove over to the black section of town.
These people hadn't voted
in any of these elections.
I was only thirteen,
but I had a learner's license.
I filled up a car with black voters and
dropped them at the polling place,
and waited and took them on home.
Before they got out of the car to vote,
I said, I don't mean to influence you,
but I think you should know
that Mr. Charles Hazard
intentionally killed my dog.
About 400 ballots were cast in that election
and I drove 96 of them to the polls.
Hazard lost by sixteen votes.
And that's the day
I fell in love with America.
What time do we arrive?
I want CIA in my office at 10.
Assistant Deputy Director or higher.
Tell them that if I
don't see someone at 10,
I'm going to start docking their allowance
and they won't get more money off of me.
Yes Sir.
Get me another one of them,
would you please?
Yes sir.
PMKs, R57 grenade launchers and
Pakistan by air and sea and then in trucks
taken to the Afghanistan border.
And we take 'em across on mules
They gotta be checked out.
For what?
Diseases - foot and mouth.
The mules have better
health care than the Afghans.
They said it will cost a little extra if
we want them pre-trained.
To do what?
Walk over a mountain
with ammunition their back.
Why do they need to
be trained to do that,
isn't that something they
want to do naturally?
Afghanistan thinkin' about
building some fuckin' roads?
Gust.
Yeah?
I got something for you.
It changed everything. Take your newspaper.
-- Ok
No problem.
Thank you.
He should be here in a minute.
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.
Good morning.
Good morning, Congressman.
Welcome back.
Hello, Marla.
Welcome back.
- Suzanne.
- Welcome back.
Who are you?
This is Gust Avrakotos,
he's here to bring the information that Congressman wanted...
Bonnie! Yes sir.
I said Assistant Deputy Director or higher!
I know that. No Deputy will be coming here without a subpoena.
The man who Mr. Need, Member.
You're on the Afghanistan desk?
Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't be to proud of that.
I just go back from there.
Well, I know. And then there's
that a hell of a flight too.
The nine hour flying time. The stop
in Brussels plus the time difference.
I'm a little grumpy myself...
I'm not grumpy because that flight...
We wanted to give you this.
We know you like single malt.
It's called Talisker
Imported from Scotsmen that turn Europe
The Kings took it. It is very good.
Who are you again?
Gust Avrakotos.
Have Bobby come in.
Yes sir.
Why this present?
From the Afghanistan desk because
you doubled the budget for Mikado team.
Well.
Thank you.
Ah, it was nothin'.
It's a nice bottle of Scotch.
Must have been hard to get.
Doubling the budget was nothing.
$10 million for covert ops is
meaningless for making a difference.
Now hang on just one second.
I don't remember your name.
- Gust Avrakotos.
- Gust Avrakotos.
Yeah.
You mind if I call you Gus?
Well, my name is Gust, t,
but I don't care.
Fifteen hours ago, I offered
Harold Holt the keys to the safe.
- OK.
I stood there his office of his level 5 and
I said "how much do you need".
And Harold was apparently annoyed.
Well, Harold Holt is a
best tool, Congressman.
He's a cake eater, he's a
clown, he's a bad Station Chief
and I don't mean to cast
dispersions on a guy,
but he's going to get us all killed.
Really?
Yeah.
How does expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...
He said a sudden influx of money...
Of course your money and
weaponry draw attention,
he's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.
What the hell are you talking about?
Excuse me.
I'm the Congressman's aide, Bonnie Bach.
Gust Avrakotos.
Gus, I need a moment, please.
- Sure.
Girls.
Tell me what's happening.
A Justice Department task force that
was formed last year to investigate the
reports of sex between Members of
the House and their male interns,
has recently widened to
increasing use of operational clout
by the Senators and Congressmen.
Do you know a man named Paul Brown?
Shit.
Paul Brown,
under investigation by federal prosecutors for fraud,
He wanted me to invest in TV show for Crystal.
He said that he had witnessed you
using cocaine nine times in Las Vegas.
According to the records.
Alright, guys.
I was in Las Vegas with
Crystal and Paul Brown,
because she wanted me to
talk to him about this thing.
No cocaine?
I want you to go in the other room
and start on a statement.
You two go start on the phone.
Alright everyone, it going to be alright.
Gus!
Some problem?
No.
What do you mean he's not
trying to defeat the Soviets?
Well, he wants to bleed them.
They'll be like Vietnam,
making them keep sending troops,
sending more money,
more troops, more money,
blow their fucking minds,
the way we did.
You mean to tell me that
US strategy in Afghanistan
is to have the Afghans keep
walking into machine gun fire,
until the Russian run out of bullets.
That's Harold Holt's strategy,
its not US strategy
What is US strategy?
Well, strictly speaking, we don't have one,
but we're working hard on that.
Who's we?
Me and three other guys.
Would you excuse me?
Sure.
Alright, what do we have?
Representative Charles Wilson informed
he is joining several Members of Congress
who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task-force...
Remove "task-force",
it sounds like LA is running this thing.
Who is the prosecutor?
Rudolph Giulianni, the New York 7th District,
you know him?
No.
This has been going on forever.
We should say that too.
Representative Charles Wilson informed
he is joining several Members of Congress
who are under investigation by the
Justice Department,
for what is now an 18
month long wide-ranging
examination that has
resulted in no convictions.
Congressman Wilson has not
been charged with any crime
nor has he been questioned
by the authorities.
He denies any allegation of
illegal or improper behavior.
He said he would cooperate
with the ongoing investigation.
Run it by Stu.
Yes sir.
Gus.
You and three other guys.
Yeah well...
I'll tell you what I know.
I can get the money, now.
If the $10 million is a joke,
fine, what do you need?
To do what?
Shoot down helicopters.
Shoot down helicopters.
We need to help them shoot down
the god damned helicopters.
Everything's going
to start going our way.
There's a story about a
Zen Master and a little boy.
Yeah.
It's Stu.
Oh, you should be in on this.
Stu?
No, no, everything's fine.
The party's in Vegas.
A lot of drugs, a lot of people I don't know.
And there was Crystal Lee,
and this guy, Paul Brown.
He wanted me to invest in a
TV show for Crystal.
I don't know.
I don't know, it was going to be
like a "Dallas" set in Washington.
Ok
Ok
Will Crystal back up your story
that you we're using?
Just go.
or I'll start.
Yeah right.
You should never been in
same room, Congressman.
Gus.
Yeah.
This Swiss mega anti-aircraft gun...
Listen, Charlie...
Don't forget the limo driver.
What limo?
Yeah, the limousine from the
casino to the airport maybe.
Its easy enough to
track that limo driver
and ask him what went
on in the back seat, so...
in terms of cleaning up this...
Were you listenin' at the door?
I wasn't listenin' at door.
Were you standing at the god
damned door listening to me? - No.
How could you even.... that's a thick door.
You stood there
and you listened to me.
That door don't mean anything,
I brought the scotch bottle.
What?
It's got a little transmitter on it and
I got a little thing in my ear, get past it
I don't believe this.
Who the fuck are you?
I got this thing in my ear right now,
take it easy.
I was gonna tell you about it,
when I left the room for a second while you being indited.
Is there a camera in here?
That's a little paranoid.
Will could take the bug off my Scotch bottle now?
Sure.
I saw two kids,
they had their hands blown off,
while they were trying
to pick up something shiny.
Sometimes those kids
think those bombs are toys.
The children suffer.
Yeah.
And they're rapin' their women.
Yeah.
Half of them pregnant.
It's as bad as it can be..
But they still want to go out
and fight the Red Army.
Each and every one of them.
I've never had seen anything like it.
Speaking of that,
let's be clear.
I want to kill Russians
as much as you do.
And the Swiss? The right weapon, it is what you want?
You know what?
It's a long flight,
you're under a lot of stress.
You need a rest.
I don't need to rest.
You need a drink?
Oh god, yeah.
You ever try out this stuff,
you know does it release gas?
I don't think so,
but open it over there.
What's a guy like you doing at the Agency?
You mean a street guy?
You mean like James Bond.
You ain't Thomas Jefferson,
so call it even.
Not a big deal.
the orders at the Bureau are still not very good at this.
You ready to shoot down helicopters, Gus?
We need at least 50 armor guns.
That's going to cost a lot more than
I'm just sayin' for the fourth time,
I can find the money.
How?
Use the oil company.
be recommended
I'm not sure.
Who is sure?
We have a weapons guy named Mike Vickors.
I'll call him.
Let's call him right now.
Here is a test.
You see the nerdy looking kid in the white shirt,
playing against the four guys at once?
Yeah.
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons expert with the CIA?
Hmmm.
That was a trick question, Charlie.
It's the nerdy looking kid in the white shirt.
I just couldn't resist having fun.
Mike.
Just a second.
We need you now, Mike.
Checkmate.
Mike Vickers, this is Congressman Charles Wilson
with the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
How are you, sir?
Fine, thank you.
How old are you?
I'll thirty next week.
This is the CIA weapons expert?
That's right.
Well he's a little seedy.
Mike!
Yeah, the Bishop to Queenside seven.
See, he's not even looking at the board.
That's beautiful skill.
Afghanistan never more respect
Time to play chess during the war.
Did my office did I not make it clear that
I am in no mood to be fucked around with!
You answer to me,
you answer Jim Baker, which do you want?
That's a fuckin' Green Beret, Charlie.
He's trained with the Seals.
Nobody is trying to fuck with you.
Mike?
Ready when you are.
Knight to Queen's bishop five.
Queen's to King's Rook three,
diagonal right, you don't wanna trade queens with me.
Shit.
Alright.
I apologise.
Ok
Are we friends?
As a former Naval Officer myself Mike,
I should have, I should have known better.
As a former Naval Officer,
I'd be surprised if you had.
Hey, what the fuck.
He said he was sorry.
What can I do for you, sir?
He wants to make a recommendation
to the subcommittee.
Swiss made oil and exterior anterior aircraft cannon unfortunately
uses dolomite 2400 gunships in the mountains, right?
Well, it's a good start,
but the Russians will just start
flying higher altitudes missions.
So what else would they need?
XP 170s, X174s, AMS.
Soviets didn't come to
Afghanistan on a Euro-Rail pass.
They've come in P-55 tanks.
The Burgers need RPG-7
anti-tank grenade launchers,
A condition 170mm rockets, wire mines,
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, starky weapons,
ammunition for all of the above.
Frequency hopping radios
and burst transmitters,
these are not going to be easy to find.
You can read it all in a report that I made,
you'll be the first one that did.
Send a copy over to me
by courier right away.
Alright.
That was a report?
It's not that simple.
Why not?
Well, one thing it's covert,
An Afghan Freedom Fighter gets captured
it can't be with an
American made weapon on him,
that's how a Cold War
turns into an actual war,
not somethin' you want to keep a lid on.
So, anything we
give 'em has to look like  it
could have possibly been
captured from the Soviets.
That's right.
You know who's good at that?
The      .
That' right.
What he just described there costs
as much as $40 million.
I can get the appropriate...
How?
I wanna know how you are
going to get the approval
of Congress from the city
noted accomplished for nothin',
for five million dollars
requested by the President?
When a blanket vote makes
it through the subcommittee,
the full body has to vote on it blind.
They know the dollar amount,
but they don't know what it's for.
So theoretically, your $10 million
can become $40 million,
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.
Most Congressmen wouldn't
know they voted on it.
That's the beauty of it.
How do you get it by the nine
other sub-committee members.
All I need to get is
the Committee Chairman.
Doc Long.
He darts back in and gets the votes
of the other committee members.
Yep.
I don't believe you.
I don't care.
Up until the phone rang this morning,
Charlie, I never heard of you.
Well, ask away.
I did.
What'd you find out?
That you've had slim achievements in six terms,
and you been re-elected five times.
Anything else?
That you hold more IOU's than
any member of the House.
How about that.
I represent the only district in America
that's got one candidate.
They want their guns,
and they want no taxes.
That's it.
I can do favors.
I get to vote yes a lot.
Me and three other guy
are killing Russians.
Is it possible, that I've got the only
elected official in town that can help?
Give me a week to set things up.
No backup plan.
I have a friend.
???
He's what we need for this,
God help us.
Should be interesting.
Yeah.
Alright.
We need you.
You would be our man for
I am not part of anything yet.
That's what makes you so perfect.
No one has     will bother you.
No one has to know of your
relationship with the speaker.
We need to turn around,
Seeing everything that happens   it turns out.
But we will working with the Saudi's.
Careful...
Careful, what do you mean?
I'm not sayin' anything.
Why not?
I don't like these two other guys over there.
Oh, are they bodyguards?
There're not ours.
I'll just tell you something and I'll shut up.
Do you want me to move Israel
toward a partnership with
Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan?
And Saudi Arabia.
Well, just a couple of problems I can foresee,
off the top of my head.
Look...
Charlie, Pakistan and Afghanistan don't
recognize our right to exist.
Calm down.
We just got back from
fighting a war with Egypt,
and every person who has ever tried
kill me and my family
has been trained in Saudi Arabia!
That's not entirely true, Zvi.
Some were trained by us.
Zvi, Gust's sense of humor
is really quite bizarre.
Zvi, we're gonna miss...
this front of the Cold War,
it's not in Berlin, it's not in Cuba,
it's not in Czechoslovakia.
It's in a pile of rocks called Afghanistan.
These are the only people
who actually shoot at the Russians,
and you and I know we have
to get Soviet made weapons
into the hands of the Mujahideen.
You and I know where
the largest stockpile
of Soviet weapons
outside Soviet Union is.
I can't say what kind of armaments and
what kind of weapons are confiscated.
I can.
These are uh... TL-11 satellite photos.
They've been degraded
so I can show 'em to you.
That's a five wheel chassis tank.
That's not an MK-1,
it's a T-55.
Four of those are about 12 miles from here.
What do you want tanks
in the mountains for?
We don't, I just wanted you to know
I know what you have.
and $4.5 million.
This you can appropriate?
Yes.
Without the press asking questions about it.
Well there's good news there,
because the press will
be busy asking him about
a week in Vegas and his pending arrest
on charges of narcotics possession.
Oh, Gust.
Shit! Charlie?
It's nothin'.
Is this true?
It doesn't really matter.
- Why?
I'll just explain no matter what, as long as the
pressing section goes to be on the left hand,
the department burial carrier will be on the
right hand, no one's going to fuckin' notice.
What the hell happened?
It's not germane, what's germane is these people
are fighting and they're dying
and are being massacred in their own homes.
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them shoot down
these fuckin' helicopters?
I love you, Charlie.
But you are grown man who
still hasn't learned to look both ways
before he crosses the fucking street.
Yes, I'm in.
Good!
But I don't like this guy.
I know how you feel.
What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.
This meeting is going to be
a lot of professionals.
Oh absolutely, we'll be talking to a
Deputy Defense Minister while his boss is with
a belly dancer that's a friend of Charley's.
What?
A good friend mine from Unita, Texas
is a well known belly dancer
so it's been agreed to perform in Egypt,
so she's over there.
While she's dancing for the Defense Minister,
we'll be talking to the Deputy.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, she's supposed to be good.
She's an extraordinary woman.
She dances very well.
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.
This is your girlfriend?
No, she's a friend.
I understand that her father wouldn't
allow dancing because of their religion.
Yeah, that's correct.
What religion is that?
Baptists.
As I was saying,
the Russians observed an important thing the hard way.
To fear God's vengeance upon those
who oppress Islamic servants
to submit to his law,
their sculls were
hanging from the treetops.
You can do whatever you want
with the sculls, I suppose.
But as Gust's concern is the SA-7 Sierra missiles y'all have,
for some reason he thinks they're a scoring problem.
No, no, no.
SA-7's will score properly.
What about the oppression by my people?
Oh, Zvi.
I beg your pardon?
Do we have to do this now?
I am about to arrange for probably
$5 million worth of guns to be put
into the hands of Muslims.
I meant no disrespect.
Oh, really?
Well, none of that's important.
The Soviets have arranged five years ago
to have moved 25,000 a week.
That's correct.
What about an incinderary device?
What kind?
Bicycle bombs, mines, plastics,
trip wire mines.
Yes.
Whatever you need.
We can't give triple pricing now
We when get back from
home we'll make it up to you.
I agree.
Alright.
Hey, when you get back there,
I'm orderin' the shift.
'cause these people are totally fuckin' use cold.
And I'm not just talking about the Muslims.
It's alright.
I know it is.
The Mousaad by the way, to talk about your friend in Houston.
He has many reasons for not wanting
That the press knows it.
Joanne is reasonably discreet.
Uh, she's usin' a....
non-secular vocabulary.
I fear that it does not know
plenty of reasons for this war.
Americans don't fight in religious wars.
Is that right.
Yeah, that's what I like about America.
Ladies and gentlemen this is your Captain.
we have started our descent
landing in Washington ...
I am going to Houston,
and then ...
Talk to her.
Yes, I come with it.
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?
Just for this one purpose,
yes Mr. President.
The Israelis have the largest stockpile of
Soviet made weapons in the free land.
Yes, I know that.
I have to transact this in secret.
Pakistan and Israel have been
public enemies for a long time.
Yeah, but I don't think that's a tough sell.
You have authority to do this?
No, I'm just getting the weapon, and I'm pretty close to that.  I need to get by the Voting Act.
I don't know that is...
But Charlie...
Yes.
If I see one fucking start ?  I'll give a  ?   .
You're welcome.
We're very close.
Excuse me.
Whether I make the speech?
Why?
It is an option. Not want?
It's an introduction, Charlie.
I'll be fine.
Today, we honor President Zia Ul-Haq of Pakistan.
Before we go any further,
I would like y'all to hear this.
President Zia did not kill Butto.
His entire message has been refreshing,
all things in Pakistan
has changed, radically.
I asked you all here today...
You disappeared.
You weren't serving alcohol.
It's a condition of
of Pakistan values
You had to do this, with all these people,
Under one roof at the same time?
I think I felt happy to
Say what we had to say.
Zia did not kill Butto.
That's not something you commonly hear in a introduction
He didn't do it, Charlie.
Butto had a trial and was found guilty.
He was shot in front of the ?.
What are you talking about?
Enjoy the moment.
a trial down was.
What?
We can not divest the
people who support me.
It's lunches like this that are
raising the money we need.
That wasn't done by people
Which were in Houston.
This was done by the CIA.
It's being done in Pakistan,
and it's going to get done quietly.
And you start makin' people think
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity...
I'm saved by Jesus Christ, Charlie,
and I'm not ashamed of it.
My point is, this is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion.
We have they want the communist's scarin' them for.
And I     Not understood.
Just tamp it down a little.
I can't watch this against God's will, sweetie.
You can try.
I gotta get back to DC,
they've set up a briefing for me at Langley.
On what?
About gettin' the guns.
Afghanistan's barely a country.
No phones or roads outside the cities.
It's like met a villager can pass
Long without contact
With another, 5 km away,
Even without the war.
I believe they are divided into
Hundreds of small militias
Totaling about 150,000.
These guys have been training.  Twenty different wars since    World War I
And it has the ability to sustain a war long.
Do you have anyone in mind?
The most successful rebels today are in the Panjshir Valley.
They're called the United Fronts,
or the Council of the North.
We're locked in for
$10 million in weapons
and ten to fifteen Agency
advisers to train them.
Who's their leader?
Akmed Shamasud.
He is Tajik so he's not well liked Pashtuns.
So then, what?
The Tajiks have a problem with the Pashtuns?
They say when a Tajik wants to make love
to a woman, her first choice is always a Pashtun man.
It's fun in the original languagmane.
Well, it is enough.
I will take care of my part.
Don't fuck us up now.
I think not.
Afghanistan, Egypt,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
These are from the dictator list.
And they'd like to
blow the only democracy
in the region right
into the Mediteranean.
The Israelis will be with us.
Well, Zvi Rafiah is crazy.
These people are extremists.
Among Communists
And fundamentalists, if they settle
Be killed, the better. It is a public service
They do the rest of the world.
You're wrong about that, Doc
and you know      that's not so.
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets raped,
but there's a witness.
Now, in Pakistan it takes four witnesses,
so the rape is thrown way and
The girl was arrested. Can you tell me why?
Fornication.
That's right.
Mr. Chairman of them is the only assume that
The risks of train and fund the Mujahideen.
While Egypt and Arabia ...
The Saudis ask some funding
To Congress?
Exactly.
So the $40 million that you asked,
Will be 80.
$40 million to us.
You want to put 80 million dollars
in the hands of these people?
Doc, if you were me up there,
You would stop talking about "these people".
They are farmers and children.
And face the enemy forces.
It is a great opportunity for America.
And how is an opportunity for America
Send help to these children, and
For the mothers of our enemies.
All you have to do to change things is
to support me in the committees.
I'm sorry Charlie,
but doubling from five to ten million is one thing,
You know, I just can't get behind this.
Joanne Herring's residence.
Ms. Herring,
I have Congressman Wilson for you.
Hello.
Hey.

That's why you're the best secretary, Boo-boo.
I got Stu on the line,

Hey Stu, how you doin' today?
Alright.
She's not a stripper, Stu.
She just posed for the cover.
What the hell difference does it make?
They talked to Crystal.
Yeah.
Giulliani's been talkin' to the limo driver.
That's what Gust said they would do.
But the driver said he didn't see anything.
He didn't see anything.
So Giuliani's been giving every
limo driver between the Audosy
and Silver Springs to see if any of them
can recall seeing you using cocaine.
Joanne Herring on the line.
Hey you.
We're on again in the morning.
You're kidding?
No.
What'd you have to promise him?
There's a blind girl in Jail, she was raped.
Yeah.
You're gonna get her out.
What, I gotta bust somebody out of jail?
Don't be stupid, Charlie.
You're gonna tell Zia to pardon her.
It's Doc's condition.
Our flight's tonight, buy me a drink.
Yes ma'am.
We are almost there, Charlie.
I'm goin' back to Pakistan tomorrow.
Whoo!
Charlie!
- Thanks.
We need another round.
Hey, Joanne. Can I join you?
Yes.
You have to wear so
More humble when at the border.
Well, thank you, but I been
passonatley involved in the cause
of Afghans for three years,
I've been there many times.
I tell you what,
I'll just go fuck myself.
I'm not easily shocked, Mr. Avrakotos.
Did you know you were acertariam fast.
Charlie, sorry.
Stu on the phone for you.
You can take it at the bar.
Stu? That can't be any good.
How'd you hook up with Charlie?
Are you also passonately invloved
in the cause of the Afghans?
Naw, I just delay  to do anything else
I mean, how did you get into the CIA?
I didn't.
I'm with the Department of Agriculture.
Division of food and plants.
The apple imports.
You don't seem like the apple type.
Yeah, I know.
It wasn't me.
Where you are from?
What do you care?
Are you a Catholic?
Greek-Orthodox.
At least you're a Christian.
Imagine my relief.
What's your problem with me?
What I've found in my business,
is that people with time on their hands get involved with politics
I start forgetting who I'm supposed to be shootin' at.
That being the apple import business.
Yes ma'am.
I have to remember that.
Please do.
It's Over!
It's Over!
It's over!  That was Stu and it is over!.
Has Crystal framed you?
Well, she's witnessed been doin' coke in the Cayman Islands.
Oh shit, Charlie.
No it's alright.
It's out of the Justice Department's juristiction.
It's over!
I'm goin'  home.
Gust.
Joanne... the most
important trip in my life,
see you in the morning,
get plenty of sleep,
I'm goin' home.
Mario, take me.
Yes, Mr.
He may be in trouble with the press, but he's staying out of jail.
And is out of the chain, now,
And you ve not the hand of God in this?
Some people will disagree with me, but
I see God kilometers of the story.
Moreover, if you sleep me,
Assure that try to change their minds.
Oh, you change.
I'll see you on the plane.
Sluts.
Ponham beyond that.
Doc's eatin' this up.
We're gonna get the money.
Charlie!
Charlie!
He's a little senile.
Don't be silly.
He's chairs the subcommittee.
Alright.
Charlie, Joanne, this certainly has
been an eye opening experience.
It's absolutley stunning.
How'd you pull this off, Mr. Ar.....
Conte.
They only to go back there and fight.
and you're their savior, Mr. Chairman.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
Look now.
She loves it.
These people were expecting you.
They're sitting here, and bleedin',
and waitin' and prayin' for you.
It's only gonna be a man like you
that can save them.
We know don't we?
About our men.
What we are able to do when you want.
Charlie, I think they want
you to make some comments.
No, you should do it Mr. Chairman.
This people have been
waiting a long time for this.
Show them you're     you can do it.
Show your wife.
I feel a little emotional right now.
Show them.
You can do it.
Alright.
Good job, buys.
No, this is great.
It is a great move.
My friends.
My son served in Vietnam.
He was wounded fighting and got a medal
against the Soviet oppressors.
I didn't know about the child.
So you see, I am not so strange ...
I am no stranger to
the horrors and atrocities
of the communists.
I you talk about God, for
A simple reason.
We need him on our side.
These Russian weapons, every last one of them
... We explodi them to
Far from here!
Summer that we will give them weapons.
Summer we going training.
I believe that the word of God are:
"Sooner or later, God can't be on both sides "
This is the good against evil
and I want you to know that the America
is always going to on the side of good.
And God will always punish the wicked.
It has been a year of setback and frustration.
And the Soviet army, more than at any time,
Want to win this war soon.
Now, it's offensive.
The Mujahideen attack and retreat.
The Afghan resistance, which has
been stimulated by the United States
but although the support has not been
translated into military hardware.
The guerrillas still claim to be using
the AK 47 ...
... But it has not been enough.
They have waited in vain ...
... For modern weapons, to
fight the Red Army.
The guerrillas survive and hope.
The Soviet armed forces
Increased the bombing in the war.
The Soviets send more
troops and equipment back in.
Commie bastards.
We'll send them drugs and medicine.
in giving weapons to continue shooting.
It's called Milan anti-tank missille
Can the Afghans win without it?
No.
End of discussion.
... I submit a request to increase
At $30 million, totaling $70 million.
I present the Milan anti-tank Missile
We've got 300 in the field.
Let's kill some Russians!
Voting for the increase in the allocation for the Afghans is
The only way to prove that our support is serious.
How much are you asking for this?
I want to go from $70
million to $100 million,
and if you vote for me, I
can deliver the electronics.
Something in the sky?
... I asked what the reason.
How had arrived by then?
I swear, like a face durão.
... This is the group of Bamian.
They will make Fuladi ambush on the bridge.
What will take?
Go to the Bagram Air Base.
They will set the 8 th Infantry
Soviet, the horse?
You betcha.
These guys are very good.
We can't control this anymore.
The guy was in my office,
Islamabad, and I said to him ...
... That the flow of money and weapons ...
Me give that belt.
Please.
How is it possible that this Congressman,
of no particular importance,
is doing this by himself.
Admittedly, it is not impressive.
This is a war that we are fighting, Henry?
Harold, sejá there what he is doing,
Believe me
The CIA estimates that seven out evry ten times,
The increase ...
The attacks of the Mujahideen
Helicopters and airplanes.
Each ship costs Soviet
As each missile costs
Between 60 and 70 thousand.
What do you want to do?
Well, I want to double the $250 million.
I remember again:
They started with?
$5 million.
Hello.
Is this Mrs. Joanne Herring?
Where's it at, Charlie?
How was the honeymoon?
He already had a vision of you naked?
Where's is it at, Charlie?

When this was related
A secret war?
There has never been anything like this.
Since when?
Always.
I miss you, Charlie.
Ah, Joanne, I miss you too.

To know who spoke the truth!

Go ahead, Gust?
Congratulations on your re-election.
Thanks. What do you have again?

There was wild joy inside the country of Afghanistan
After that, last week, they
became the first country in history to defeat
the mighty Soviet Union.
The retreat of Soviet military power
from Afghanistan is complete.
The last Regular Army conventional force is out.
With a mix of relief and happiness,
Soviet command announced ...
That the last troops crossed
The border. Our correspondent, Direct
Afghanistan, Barry Peterson,
Continues with the coverage.
It was the last celebration. The latest
Soviet troops crossing
crossing the Friendship Bridge on the border
between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
See what you did, Charlie.
Hey, hey.  It's traditional to make a toast at a banquet   if offered
A toast in wins.

Ok
Well,
Here's to you, motherfuckers.
"And so now the Soviet military intervention
in other countries is now over."
Well, I you spoke.
He spoke what?
All I needed to do was shoot down a helicopter.
Hum It is not for nothing, but I finished
To tell the story of the teacher and the boy?
In the great witch Nitsa, Pennsylvania?
It is, indeed it is.
There was a boy who in his birthday
And everybody said: - "What wonder,
He won a horse. "
The teacher told him: - "Let's see."
Two years later, the boy falls off his horse, and breaks his leg,
And everyone said: - "What terrible."
The teacher said: - "Let's see."
Then a war started, and
All were called to the fight,
Except for the boy because his leg
Was broken,
And people said: - "What great."
And the teacher said: - "Let's see."
Then you get it?
No. No.
Because I am a donkey.
You are not a donkey, only
Is in the Congress.
Send more money.
Open roads, build schools ...
Gust, today is a party.
Reeducar the pastors, give them
Work, give them hope ...
I am trying.
-- Try more.
I mourn for every dollar.
I took you to U $ 5 million to
U $ 1 billion.
I quebrei the ice with
The zac
I am a Democrat MEP, which
It is controlled by a Republican president
And I don't sirvo why I
Secret agent and you now
Is a hero that saw a mad on TV,
In Kandahar, in his hot tub.
My God, Gust, you know the depressed
When people fill their faces.
Hey, listen to what I am speaking!
You did a great job, so
A son, pipoqueiro.
Let's see.
He said the teacher.
One million dollars for the
Reconstruction of schools?
Oh, that shit, Charlie!
Hey, I listen ...
You are not a member of Kabul.
You heard me say it was 1 million,
Or 1 billion for the reconstruction of schools?
Heard. Everyone heard since
The delta of Delaware.
I hope you have not angry, Bob,
Because it is the last thing I want to do.
Look, I was with the President in
Roosevelt Room last week ...
You know what he said?
He said that Afghanistan must
Move forward.
Well, so has to be.
Half the population is under 14 years ..
-- Charlie!
Half of the population is under 14 years.
Now, think how much this is dangerous.
They will return to their homes and
Their families are killed,
Their villages were burned ...
Yes, but the help kill
The guys who did this.
Yes, but they don't know, Bob. Why
They don't get the New York Times,
And even if we receive it
Was secret, remember?
This is what we always do.
We come with our ideals,
Change the world! And
Then we will leave.
Whenever we leave.
But the ball still rolling.
How?
The ball! Continued rolling.
We are now half occupied, reoganizando
The East European, you don't think?
We spend billions. Gastemos a few
Million of the budget now, building schools.

School in Pakistan.
Afghanistan.
So for the first time, one civilian
Receive our highest decoration,
The honour of his colleagues,
Ladies and gentlemen of Services

Glorious and changed the world ...
... And we fodemos them at the end of the game. "
