~ Raindrops on roses ~
~ And whiskers on kittens ~
~ Bright copper kettles ~
~ And warm woolen mittens ~
~ Brown paper packages ~
~ Tied up with string ~
~ These are a few ~
~ Of my favorite things ~
We were somewhere around
Barstow, on the edge of the desert...
when the drugs
began to take hold.
I remember saying something like:
I feel a bit lightheaded.
Maybe you should drive.
~
- Hmm ?
- Suddenly there was
a terrible roar all around us...
and the sky was full of
what looked like huge bats...
-
- all swooping and screeching
and diving around the car.
- And a voice was screaming:
- Holy Jesus, what are
these goddamned animals ?
-
-
~ Come on, baby ~
- Did you say something ?
- Hmm ?
Never mind.
It's your turn to drive.
No point in mentioning
these bats, I thought.
The poor bastard'll
see them soon enough.
~ Baby, I'm startin'
to feel human ~
- ~ Ohh, ohh, yeah ~
- ~ Hey, hey, Feel with me, baby ~
-
- ~ 'Cause I feel it comin' on ~
~
-
- Fucking pigs ! Flying !
We had two bags of grass...
five sheets of
high-powered blotter acid...
a salt shaker
half-full of cocaine...
a whole galaxy of multicolored
uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
Also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer...
- a pint of raw ether...
- Shit !
two dozen amyls.
Not that we needed all that
for the trip...
but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection...
the tendency is to push it
as far as you can.
The only thing that really
worried me was the ether.
There is nothing in the world
more helpless and irresponsible
and depraved...
than a man in the depths
of an ether binge...
and I knew we'd get into
that rotten stuff pretty soon.
A House subcommittee report
says illegal drugs killed...
last year...

- ~ One toke over the line
Sweet Jesus ~
One toke, man !
~ One toke over the line ~
~ Sittin' downtown
at a railway station ~
~ One toke over the line ~
- One toke, you poor fool ?
- ~ Sweet, sweet Mary ~
Wait'll you see
those goddamned bats, man.
~ Mine ~
~ One toke over the line ~
- Let's give that boy a lift.
- What ? No !
- ~
- Wait !
We can't stop here.
This is bat country.
Hot damn ! I never rode
in a convertible before !
Is that right ? Well, I guess
you're about ready then, aren't ya ?
We're your friends. We're not
like the others, man. Really.
No more of that talk, or I'll
put the leeches on you. Understand ?
Get in.
How long could we maintain,
I wondered.
How long before one of us starts raving
and jabbering at this boy ?
What will he think then ?
This same lonely desert was the last
known home of the Manson family.
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming...
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car ?
If so, well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
- 'Cause it goes without saying
that we can't turn him loose.
-
He'd report us at once to some kind of
outback nazi law enforcement agency...
and they'll run us down
like dogs.
- Jesus, did I say that,
or just think it ?
- Jesus, did I say that ?
Was I talking ?
Did they hear me ?
It's okay. Just admiring
the shape of your skull.
- No, thanks !
- Maybe I'd better have
a chat with this boy.
- I have asthma !
- Perhaps if I explain things,
he'll rest easy.
All right, listen.
There's one thing you should probably
understand-- Can you hear me ?
Good.
I want you to have
all the background.
- Aah !
- This is a very ominous assignment...
with overtones of
extreme personal danger.
I'm a Doctor of Journalism.
This is important, goddamn it !
- This is a fucking true story !
-
You fucking--
- Get your hands off my fucking head !
-
- Now, now, now.
- Our vibrations were
getting nasty. But why ?
Was there no communication
in this car ?
- Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts ?
-
This man at the wheel
is my attorney.
He's not just some dingbat I found on
the Strip, man. He's a foreigner.
I think he's probably Samoan.
It doesn't matter, though, does it ?
- Are you prejudiced ?
-  Hell, no.
I didn't think so.
Because, in spite of his race,
the man is extremely valuable to me.
- Oh, shit. I forgot about the beer.
You want some ?
- No.
- How 'bout some ether ?
- What ?
Never mind. All right, let's get right
to the heart of this thing.
- Twenty-four hours ago
we were sitting...
- ...in the Pogo Lounge...
of the Beverly Heights Hotel,
in the patio section, of course...
drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side...
hiding from the brutish realities
of this foul year of our Lord, 1971.
Cops were goin' apeshit--
Perhaps this is the call you've
been waiting for all this time, sir.
Perhaps.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Mmm ! Really. All right.
Yeah ? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay. Bye.
- That was headquarters.
They want me to--
- Ahem.
Thank you.
They want me to go
to Las Vegas at once...
make contact with a Portuguese
photographer named Lacerda.
He'll have
all the details.
All I have to do is check into my
soundproof suite. He'll seek me out.
- What do you think ?
- Sounds like real trouble.
You're gonna need plenty of legal
advice before this thing is over.
Oh, yeah.
As your attorney, I advise you to rent
a fast car with no top.
And you'll need
the cocaine.
Tape recorder
for special music.
Acapulco shirts.
Get the hell out of L.A.
for at least 48 hours.
- Blows my weekend.
- Why ?
'Cause, naturally, I'm
gonna have to go with you.
We're gonna have to
arm ourselves to the teeth.
Well, why not ?
I mean, if a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.
This is the American Dream
in action.
Wait !
Shit, we'd be fools not to
ride this strange torpedo
all the way out to the end.
Indeed.
We must do it.
What kind of story
is this ?
It's the Mint 400...
the richest off-road race for
motorcycles and dune buggies in
the history of organized sport.
It's a fantastic
spectacle...
in honor of some
fatback grosero...
who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel
in downtown Las Vegas.
At least that's what
the press release says.
As your attorney,
I advise you to buy a motorcycle.
How else can you cover
a thing like this righteously ?
Well, we're gonna have to
drum it up on our own.
Pure Gonzo journalism.
Shit !
Getting hold of the drugs
and shirts had been no problem...
but the car and tape recorder were
not easy things to round up at 6:30...
on a Friday afternoon
in Hollywood.
Sounds beautiful.
Great. Hang on to it.
Fuckin' A, the gentleman has
a major credit card !
That's right, man. Don't take any guff
from these fucking swine.
I just got through
saying that.
Do you realize who the fuck
you're talking to ? Do you ?
Be over in 30 minutes.
We're gonna need a sound store.
-  We won't make the nut
unless we have unlimited credit.
- We will, man.
You Samoans
are all the same.
You have no faith in the essential
decency of the white man's culture.
The store was closed...
but the salesman said
he could wait if we'd hurry.
-
-
But we were delayed en route
when the Stingray in front of us
killed a pedestrian.
We had trouble again
with the car rental agency.
Mr. Duke, we're all settled.
If I could get your John
Hancock, you're on your way.
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be real careful
with this car, right ?
Oh, yeah, man.
Of course.
Holy smokes !
You just backed over
a 2-foot concrete abutment,
you didn't even slow down.
What, were you going about,
uh, oh, I don't know,
- There's no harm done.
- Oh ?
I always test the transmission that way,
the rear end for stress factors.
- Boy, this is really a nice pen, man.
- Hey, uh, listen, you--
you fellas haven't been,
uh, drinking, have you ?
- No. Not me.
- Oh. Well--
- We're responsible people.
-
Damn it,
you've got my pen !
Goddamn hippies !
We spent the rest of that night rounding
up materials and packing the car.
Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.
Our trip was different.
It was to be
a classic affirmation...
of everything right and true
in the national character...
a gross physical salute
to the fantastic possibilities
of life in this country.
But only for those
with true grit.
And we are chock full
of that, man.
Damn right !
My attorney understands this concept,
despite his racial handicap.
- But do you ?
-
He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.
- He was lying to me.
-
Ohh ! Aaah !
Aaah ! Aaah !
Ohhhhh !
Medicine !
- What ?
- Medicine !
Medicine ? Oh, yeah, medicine !
Right. Right here.
-
- Don't worry. This man has a bad heart.
Angina pectoris.
But we have a cure for it.
Here you go. All right.
Big whiff. Big whiff.
Big whiff, sonny boy.
- Ah. There you go. Much better.
-
- Now for the doctor.
-
What the--
What the fuck are we doing out here
in the middle of the desert ?
Somebody call the police.
We need help.
- We need help.
We need help. We need help.
-
The truth.
Truth ?
We're goin' to Vegas...
to croak a scag baron
named Savage Henry.
- It's true.
- Why ? Because I've
known him for years...
but he ripped us off.
-
And you know what that means.
- And you know what that means.
- Right ?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
Savage Henry...
has cashed
his check.
- Cashed his check.
- And we're gonna rip his lungs out.
-
- And eat them. That bastard
won't get away with this.
I mean, what is going on
in this country...
when a scum sucker like that
can get away with sandbagging
a Doctor of Journalism ?
- Hey !
- Thanks for the ride !
- Don't worry about me !
- Wait a minute !
Come back
and have a beer !
Shit.
Fuck. I'm gonna miss him.
- Move over !
- Did you see his eyes ?
We have to get out of California
before that kid finds a cop.
Scoot over,
you fat bastard.
- We had a real freak on our hands !
- Oh, shit.
It was absolutely imperative
that we get to the Mint Hotel...
before the deadline
for press registration.
Otherwise we might have to
pay for our suite.
Jesus ! Did you see what God
just did to us, man ?
God didn't do that.
You did it.
You're a narcotics agent.
I knew it.
That was our cocaine,
you fucking pig, swine, whore !
You'd better be careful.
Plenty of vultures out here that'll pick
your bones clean before morning.
- You fucking whore.
- Hee hee hee.
Here's your half
of the sunshine acid. Eat it.
Yeah.
Great.
How long do I have ?
As your attorney, I advise you
to drive at top speed...
or it'll be a goddamn miracle
if we can get there before
you turn into a wild animal.
-
- ~
~ Yeah, yeah ~
- ~
- Are you ready for that ?
Checking into a Vegas hotel
under a phony name...
with intent to commit capital fraud
and a head full of acid ?
I sure hope so.
Thirty minutes.
It was going to be very close.
~
~ Well, she's all
you'd ever want ~
~ She's the kind
I'd like to flaunt ~
~ And take to dinner ~
Welcome to the Mint Hotel !
~ Well, she always
knows her place ~
~ She's got style
She's got grace ~
- ~ She's a winner ~
-
~ She's a lady ~
~ Whoa-whoa-whoa
She's a lady ~
Hmm ? Mmm.
~ Talking about
my little lady ~
- Come on, take the ticket.
We're busy here.
- ~ And the lady is mine ~
Come on, take the ticket.
Take it.
Take the ticket.
- ~
- I need this. Right ?
I'll remember your face.
There is
no way of explaining the terror I felt.
- ~
-  Attention,
all Mint Hotel guests.
Will the owner
of a green Pinto...
Minnesota license plate
TG0432--
I was pouring sweat.
My blood is too thick
for Nevada.
I've never been able to properly
explain myself in this climate.
Okay. Be quiet, be calm.
Name, rank
and press affiliation.
Nothing else.
...hamburger stand.
She was a waitress about 16 years old.
They chopped her goddamn head off right
there in the parking lot...
and cut all kinds of holes in her
and sucked out the blood.
They were after the pineal gland,
I think. Yeah.
- No. How's your mama ?
-  ignore this terrible drug.
Yeah.
Pretend
it's not happening.
Hi there ! Uhh--
My name ?
Uh... Raoul Duke !
On the list.
Freelance. On the list, then ?
Total coverage.
Uh-huh.
I have my attorney...
with me...
and I realize that his name
is not on that list...
but we must have
a suite !
Must have that suite.
What's the score here ?
What's next ?
Your suite isn't ready yet...
but someone
was looking for you.
Aah ! No ! We haven't done
anything yet !
- I can handle this.
-
This man suffers
from a bad heart.
But I have plenty of medicine.
My name is Dr. Gonzo.
Prepare our suite at once.
We'll be in the bar.
Aaah !
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel that drink.
Hey, beat it.
Beat it. Go on.
I like the way you did that.
Aaah !
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
- What's that ?
- Come on, come on.
Let's get some peanuts.
That's one thing
that's good for you. Peanuts.
Ohh ! Jesus !
- Two Cuba libres, beer
and mescal on the side.
- You got it.
-  I'll bet you're a Libra.
- Mmm.
Who's Lacerda ? He's waiting
for us on the 12th floor.
Room 1250. Lacerda.
I couldn't remember.
- The name rang a bell,
but I couldn't concentrate.
-
Terrible things were happening
all around us.
Buy us some golf shoes...
otherwise we'll never
get out of this place alive.
Impossible to walk
in this muck.
No footing at all.
~
Mr. Roger Pratt, please
call the hotel operator.
~ How can I bear
to see your heart break ~
~ To see your heart break ~
~ Over me ~
~
- ~
-
I was right in the middle
of a fucking reptile zoo...
and somebody was giving booze
to these goddamn things.
It won't be long now
before they tear us to shreds.
- ~
-
- Please !
-
- Tell'em to get out
their fucking golf shoes !
-
Jesus God Almighty,
look at that bunch over there, man.
They've spotted us.
That's
the press table, man.
We're gonna have to sign in
for our credentials.
Okay ?
Are you ready ?
- Hmm ?
- Are you ready ?
- Come on, hurry up.
- Wait ! Don't leave me !
Two club sandwiches...
and, uh,
two more club sandwiches...
one, two, three, four
shrimp cocktails...
- Hmm ? Hmm ?
- and nine fresh grapefruit.
-
- Vitamin C. Need all we can get.
- Four chicken--
- There's a, uh...
big machine in the sky,
some kind of...
- Quart of rum.
- well, electric snake
coming straight at us.
Shoot it.
Not yet. I want
to study its habits.
-  You motorcycle people
sure are hearty eaters.
-
I need the cart.
I need to return with the cart.
Thank you, but the cart needs to
go back with-- I'll be back !
- You bastard.
- I've been hit, man !
I leave you alone for 3 minutes
and you start waving that
goddamn marlin spike around...
yelling about reptiles.
- What are you talking about ?
- You scared the shit
out of those people.
They were ready
to call the cops.
- Yes, sir, you were lucky
I came back in time.
- Don't come fucking near me !
-
- Leave me alone.
The only reason they gave us press
passes was to get you out of there.
-
- Oh, God ! What's that ?
That scene straightened me
right out, man.
- Is it the door ?
-
-
As the bombing continues in Laos--
- Just a minute.
-
- Holy shit.
Oh, my God.
Hi. I'm, uh, Lacerda,
your photographer.
- Duke ?
- Mm-mmm.
Back there.
-  It looks as though
the North Vietnamese may--
- Duke ? Duke ?
Hi !
Lacerda.
Your photographer.
You're not Portuguese, man !
Hey, too bad you guys
missed the bikes checkin' in.
Oh, man, what a sight !
- Husquavarnas, Yamahas, DMZs.
-
Kawasakis !
- Maicos. Pursang !
-
- Swedish fireballs.
-
Couple of Triumphs.
Here and there a CZ.
All very, very fast.
Very.
What a race
it's gonna be.
Yeah.
I'm gonna let myself out.
We know what
you're up to, man.
Hmm ?
I'm gonna tell you--
He's lying to us.
I could see it in his eyes.
Eyes ?
-
Late battle reports indicate--
- Panic now, Charlie.
Turn this shit off.
The racers were ready
at dawn.
Very tense.
In some circles the Mint 400
is a far, far better thing...
than the Super Bowl,
the Kentucky Derby...
and the Lower Oakland Roller
Derby Finals all rolled into one.
Slow down !
This is a restricted area !
This race attracts
a very special breed.
-  Fuck off.
- All right.
It was time to get grounded,
to ponder this rotten assignment...
- and figure out how to cope with it.
- Whoa !
It was time
to do the job.
Those of us who had been
up all night were in no mood
for coffee and doughnuts.
We wanted strong drink.
- We were, after all...
-
the absolute cream
of the national sporting press.
Pull !
We were gathered in Las Vegas for
this very special moment in sport.
- When it comes to a thing like
this, they don't fool around.
-
- It's, uh, just beautiful.
-
Money plays. Money plays.
Kill the body, the head will die.
Ali-Frazier fight.
- Crazy shit.
- A proper end to the '60s.
Ali beaten
by a human hamburger.
- Both Kennedys murdered by mutants.
- Hey, they're startin' !
Oh, shit, they're startin'.
Let's go !
Ladies and gentlemen...
welcome to the start of the
$50,000 Mint 400 Desert Race...
with a purse of $50,000
going to the winner...
of this grueling, gut-wrenching,
dust-eating...
in-your-face
motocross extravaganza !
And there they go !
We've got
rooster tails goin' !
We're here to spit
in your enemy's eye !
There they go.
All right, our second group
of ten is getting in place.
- Kawasakis, Triumphs, Maicos.
-
We're ready to go. It's the green flag,
and they're off !
Another great start with a lot of dirt
happening on this hill !
All right, here we go with
the third group. And they're off !
Number 45 riding
in the number-four position...
is choking
as the dust flies !
You'd better wet those bandannas
you got stretched over your face !
There was something like
- Gimme a beer, man.
- They were due to go off,
ten at a time...
every two minutes.
There you go, buddy.
-Goddamn it. What day is it ? Saturday ?
-Shit.
- More like Sunday.
- Ahh.
Hello ! Anyone ?
Have you seen the race ?
By 10:00 they were spread out
all over the course.
- Ohh !
- It was no longer a race.
Now it was
an endurance contest.
The idea of trying to cover
this race in any conventional
press sense was absurd.
- Hey ! It's pretty great, huh ?
- What ?
Come on in !
I'm just gonna try different
combinations of lenses and film...
until I find something
that works in this dust !
- What the hell ?
-
That's fucking machine guns.
They're firing at us. Machine guns !
-
- It's a goddamn war zone !
Get us out of here quick !
-  Yeee-hoo !
- Quick, man ! We're gonna
be killed, for fuck's sake !
What the-- Oh, no.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Where's
the damn race ?
Beats me, man.
We're just good, patriotic Americans
like yourself.
What outfit
you fellas with ?
Oh. The sporting press.
We're friendlies.
Hired geeks.
Uh... yeah.
- Let's go.
- Yee-ooooh !
- Good luck, gentlemen.
-
- Get him !
- Freaks.
- Take me back to the pits.
- No ! No, no, no. We have to go on.
We need total coverage !
It was time, I felt, for an agonizing
reappraisal of the whole scene.
You're fired.
Awful jackass.
All right.
- Just drive into the dust !
- I never wanna see you again.
Just drive
into the dust !
Huh ? Ohh.
The race was
definitely underway.
I had witnessed the start.
I was sure of that much.
But what now ?
What comes next ?
~
Put on the radio.
Turn on the tape machine.
Roll every
goddamn window down.
- ~ It's not unusual ~
- Let us taste this cool desert wind.
~ To be loved by anyone ~
- ~
- Ah, yes. This is what it's all about.
Total control now...
tooling along the main drag
on a Saturday night in Vegas.
Two good old boys
in a fire-apple red convertible...
stoned, ripped, twisted.
Good people.
Hot fuck.
That sounds heavy.
- Twenty-nine cent hot dogs.
- Mmm.
What are we doing here ?
Are we here to entertain
ourselves or do the job ?
Do the job, of course.
Here we go. Crab louie and a quart
of muscatel for $20.
- ~ It's not unusual ~
- As your attorney, I advise you
to drive to the Tropicana.
Guy Lombardo. He's in the Blue Room
with his Royal Canadians.
- Why ?
- Why ? Why what ?
Why should I pay my hard-earned dollars
to watch a fucking corpse ?
I don't know about you...
- but in my line of business
it's important to be hep.
-
What do you think
you're doing ?
This is not a parking area !
You've got to move your car !
You can't park your car here.
Excuse me. Sir !
- What ?
- You can't park-- Hey !
You can't
park your car here !
Is this not
a reasonable place to park ?
Reasonable ? You're on a sidewalk !
It's a sidewalk !
- This is not a parking area !
- Debbie Reynolds ?
- You can't park on the sidewalk !
- Seems like a hot ticket.
Drove all the way from L.A.
for this show.
We're friends
of Debbie's.
~
- Okay, bye.
- We'll see you later.
-
This was Bob Hope's turf.
- ~ Strangers in the night ~
Frank Sinatra's.
- ~ Exchanging glances ~
- Spiro Agnew's.
The place fairly reeked of high-grade
Formica and plastic palm trees.
Clearly a high-class refuge
for big spenders.
~
- It's started. Is she on stage ?
- She is. Sold out.
Sorry, sir. Full house.
I'm sorry, sir.
We drove all the way
from L.A. for this show.
- There are no seats left at any price.
- Fuck seats !
- We're friends with Debbie.
I used to romp with her.
- Mm-hmm.
~
- Are you prepared to go to court ?
- Well, that depends.
I wanna talk to you
for a second.
- Your attitude constitutes
a breach of faith.
- Uh, hi.
In Nevada,
that's illegal.
- What's your name ?
- My name ? Tony Pizzacata.
Tony Pizzacata.
What, may I ask, is your name, sir ?
It's on my driver's license.
- I think we might be able
to squeeze you in, sir.
- Ohh !
- Thank you kindly.
- You'll have to stand in the back.
After a lot of bad noise
he let us in for nothing...
provided we would stand
quietly in the back and not smoke.
~
Ladies and gentlemen...
the Desert Inn is proud to present
the one, the only...
the incomparable
Miss Debbie Reynolds !
~ Ooh, ooh-ooh ~
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen !
It's wonderful to be here
with you fabulous people !
Whoa !
Let's rock and roll !
~ Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band ~
- What the hell's going on ?
-
- Get'em out !
- Come on, get outta here !
- Aah !
- Get'em out.
- ~ Ooooh, ooooh ~
- Out. Get'em out !
- ~ Ooooh, ahhhh ~
-
Shit ! We wandered into a fuckin'
time capsule there.
Scumbag !
I'll find where you live and burn
your house down, you piece of shit !
- What happened ?
- Oh.
- Ohh.
- One of these days I'll toss
a fuckin' bomb in that place.
~
-
- Oh, wait. You see that ?
This is the place, man.
They'll never
fuck with us here.
Where's the ether ?
Mescaline's not working.
Oh.
There we go.
Right.
Yeah. Why not ?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Ahh. Devil ether.
It makes you behave like the village
drunkard in some early Irish novel.
Total loss of all
basic motor skills.
Blurred vision,
no balance, numb tongue.
The mind recoils in horror...
unable to communicate
with the spinal column...
which is interesting because
you can actually watch yourself
behaving in this terrible way...
but you can't control it.
~
You approach the turnstiles
and know that when you get there...
you have to give the man two dollars
or he won't let you inside...
but when you get there
everything goes wrong.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
you think, "What's happening here ?"
-You hear yourself mumbling:
-Dogs fucked the Pope. No fault of mine.
~
Ether is the perfect drug
for Las Vegas.
In this town they love a drunk.
Fresh meat.
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Holy--
So they put us through the turnstiles
and turned us loose inside.

-  Ladies and gentlemen...

- the Bazooko Casino Circus
proudly presents...
the Flying Fellinis !
Ooooh-whoop !
~
Oh, my God !
Whoop !
~ Mm-hmm ~
Whoa !
Excuse me.
- Get out of my way, you--
-
A drug person can learn to cope
with things like seeing
their dead grandmother...
crawling up their leg
with a knife in her teeth...
but nobody should be asked
to handle this trip.
Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep
world would be doing Saturday night...
if the Nazis
had won the War.
This was the Sixth Reich.
Place your bets !
Everyone's a winner !
Step right up and shoot
the pasties off the nipples
of a ten-foot bull dyke...
and win
a cotton candy goat !
Step up to this
fantastic machine !
For just 99 cents your likeness
will appear 200 feet tall...
on a screen
over downtown Las Vegas.
For just 99 cents more
you can have a voice message !
Say whatever you want, fella !
Oh, they'll hear you, all right !
You'll be 200 feet tall !
The ether was wearing off.
The acid was long gone.
But the mescaline
was running strong.
Good mescaline
comes on slow.
The first hour's
all waiting...
and then about halfway
through its second hour...
you start cursing the creep who burned
you because nothing's happening.
And then... zang !
I hate to say this--
but this place is getting to me.
I think I'm--
getting the fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find
the American Dream.
Now that we're right
in the vortex, you wanna quit ?
You must realize, man,
we've found the main nerve.
That's what--
gives me the fear.
- Oh, look !
-
There's, uh, two women
fucking a polar bear.
Don't tell me
those things.
Not n--
now, man.
This is my last drink.
How much money can you lend me ?
Not much. Why ?
- I have to go.
- Go ?
- Yeah. Leave the country.
- Oh, no. Calm down.
You'll be straight in a few hours.
Just sit the fuck down.
Don't fuck around, man.
This is serious.
One more hour in this town--
I'll kill somebody.
-
- Okay, I'll lend you some money.
Can we make it ?
- I wanna leave fast.
- Okay.
Let's pay this bill,
get up very slowly--
I think it's gonna be
a long walk.
Light, sir ?
Do they pay you to s--
screw that bear ?
What ? What ?
- What did he say ?
- He's drunk.
You'd better take care
of your friend.
Madam, sir, baby, child,
whatever, can I pay--
Here, take this.
That should be enough.
Hey, come on.
Let's go downstairs and gamble.
You guys
don't fucking give up.
Where'd he go ?
Where did he go ?
- When is this thing gonna stop ?
- Stop ?
- Stop it !
- It won't stop.
It's never gonna stop, man.
Don't move.
You'll fall down.
Fuck, he's--
Where did he go-- Oh.
Come on. Let go.
Quick, like a bunny.
Hop ! Hop !
- Come on. Hop !
- I can't !
Oh, you sniveling,
chicken shit bastard !
All right.
Come on--
Oh, fuck ! Ohh !
Come on. You fell, you fell.
Let's go.
Son of a bitch. You pushed me.
- Go away !
- Come on.
All right. Stay here and
go to jail. I'm leaving.
Come on, you fiend !
- Step right over--
- Nothing. I want nothing.
Did you see that ?
Some son of a bitch
just kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender. Wanted to stomp
you for what you said to the waitress.
- Holy moley ! Holy moley !
- Cows are gonna kill me.
Bisexuals
are gonna kill me.
Let's get outta here.
Where's the elevator ?
Don't go near the elevator !
That's just what they want us to do.
Trap us in a steel box, take us down
to the basement. Here.
Don't run, man. They'd like
any excuse to shoot us.
You drive.
I think there's something wrong with me.
Mm-mmm.
Wrong door.
- Hmm ?
- Wrong door.
This is not
a good town for psychedelic drugs.
Extremely menacing vibrations
were all around us.
We finally made it to the room,
but the key wouldn't open the door.
- Those bastards have
changed the lock on us, man.
- Already ?
They probably searched the room, man.
Jesus Christ, we're finished.
Move it !
- Watch out ! Watch out !
- Aaah !
-  Whoa !
- Bolt everything !
- Use all the chains !
- ~
Mmm. That's better.
That's better. Ah.
Where did this one
come from ?
Uh, that's Lacerda's.
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought we might need it.
What for ?
So we can go up there and blast him
out of bed with a fire hose, man.
I think you should leave
that poor bastard alone.
- He told me he was gonna
turn in early, so--
- I knew it.
- He told me he was gonna
turn in early, so--
- I knew it.
He got a hold
of my woman, man !
You mean that, uh, blonde groupie
with the film crew ?
Shit. Think he sodomized her ?
That's right. Laugh about it.
He's gluing her eyes shut
right now, man.
You goddamn honkies are all the same.
You goddamn honkies
are all the same !
Jesus God Almighty, man,
where'd you get that big fucker ?
Room service
sent it up.
I needed something
to cut the limes, man.
Limes ?
What limes ?
They didn't have any.
They don't grow in the desert.
That dirty
toad bastard.
Should've taken him out
when I had a chance.
Now he has her, man !
He got a hold
of my baby, yeah.
I remembered the girl.
We'd had a problem with her
in the elevator a few hours earlier.
My attorney had made
a fool of himself.
- I think you look just like him.
- You think so ?
You must be a rider.
Huh ? Huh ?
She's, uh,
speaking to you.
What class are you in ?
Class ?
What the fuck
do you mean ?
- What do you ride ?
-
See, we're here getting
a little footage on the race for--
a television series.
-
- I thought maybe, um, we could use you.
Oh, use me ?
I ride a--
"Mother of God," I thought.
Here it comes.
I ride the big fuckers.
You know ? Big ones.
- The really big fuckers. Yeah.
-
Vincent Black Shadow.
We're with the,
uh, factory team.
- Bullshit.
- What ?
Bullshit.
Uh-oh.
I think there's some kind of ignorant,
chicken shit-- Move over, man.
An ignorant chicken fucker
in this town.
You pink motherfucker.
I can show you better
than I can tell you, ma'am.
Got a light ? Hmm ?
No.
You don't trust me,
do you ? Huh ?
- Put the smile away.
- It's okay. I know these guys.
Keep smiling, jerk-off.
Keep trying me.
- You wanna impress her ?
Well, impress her with me.
-
Oh, fuck.
Whoo !
- Whoo ! Whoo !
- No, you goddamn freak ! Freak !
-
- Oh, shit !
The police will be
coming after you.
- Gimme the key.
- Shh. Shh.
Gimme the goddamn key !
- ~ For your love ~
- Whoo !
- ~ For your love ~
- ~ I give you everything and more ~
- Oh, no.
- Put the knife away.
- I been walking all day.
Come on. It's in my pocket.
Come on.
~ For your love ~
~ I give you everything
I I give you diamonds, I ~
~ Know the place
that will excite ~
- ~ I'll make you feel
you'll need me at night ~
- Goddamn it.
- ~
- It's serious now, man.
That girl understood, man.
Whew.
She fell in love
with me, man.
Eye contact, man.
Wait.
Ohh !
I should go up there and castrate
that fucker. I'll take the blame, man.
Let's just leave that
weird fucker alone, man. Come on.
Have you made a deal
with him ?
Did you put him on to her ?
Huh ? Huh ?
Huh ?
All right, look...
you better put that
goddamn blade away, man.
Get your fuckin' head
straight.
I'm gonna go
get the car washed.
One of
the things you learn after years
of dealing with drug people...
is that you can
turn your back on a person...
but never turn your back
on a drug...
especially when it's waving
a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.
-
-
Whoa !
What was I doing out here ?
What was the meaning
of this trip ?
Was I just roaming around
in a drug frenzy of some kind...
or had I really come out here
to Las Vegas to work on a story ?
Who are these people,
these faces ?
Where do they come from ?
They look like caricatures
of used car dealers from Dallas...
and, sweet Jesus, there are
a hell of a lot of them
at 4:30 on a Sunday morning...
still humping
the American Dream--
that vision
of the big winner...
somehow emerging from the last-minute,
pre-dawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.
- Twenty.
- We change a twenty.
Thank you.
- Here we go.
- Okay.
~ Spinning the wheel, Spinning the wheel
Spinning the wheel ~
~ Make me rich
Make me very rich ~
Eee-yo !
- That's ten.
- Oh, you bastard !
- Shit.
- Sorry.
No, no. Calm down.
Learn to enjoy losing.
~
~
~
Fuck, man, it's a fuckin'
great deluge in here.
Don't touch that. Leave it alone.
Don't fuck with it, man !
-
- ~
Oh, God.
Did you eat all this acid ?
That's right.
Music !
You better pray to God
there's some Thorazine in that bag.
- Otherwise, you're
in bad fucking trouble.
- Put that tape on !
- What tape ?
- Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
- I need a rising sound.
- You're doomed.
I'm leaving here
in two hours.
Then they're gonna come
beat the mortal shit out of you
right there in that tub.
All right, I'll do it !
I'll do it. I'll do it. Fuck, man.
All right, I'll do it !
I'll do it. I'll do it. Fuck, man.
Just do me one
last favor, will ya ?
Give me two hours.
That's all I ask.
Two hours to sleep
before tomorrow.
- This is fixed.
- ~
It's gonna be
a very difficult day.
I'll give you
all the time you need.
Electrocution.
We don't want that.
-  Fuck off.
-
~
~ When logic and proportion ~
- ~ Have fallen ~
- Goddamn it !
~ Sloppy dead ~
~ And the White Knight ~
- ~ Is talking backwards ~
- Let's see.
- ~ And the Red Queen's
"Off with her head" ~
-
- ~ Remember ~
-  Oh, God Almighty.
- Help ! Help ! Help me ! Help !
- ~ What the dormouse said ~
- Help !
- Shit ! He's killing himself !
- ~ Feed your head ~
- Don't touch it ! Don't touch it !
- For fuck's sake, man !
- ~ Feed your head ~
Back, God--
Back, motherfucker !
- On a roll, man ! I need it again !
- What ?
When it comes to that fantastic note...
when the rabbit
bites its own head off...
I want you to throw
that fuckin' radio...
into the tub with me.
Fuck ! You've gone
completely sideways, man.
That'll blast you right through
the wall. You'll be stone dead
in ten seconds.
- Fuck, they'll make me
explain things. Shit.
- Bullshit.
Don't fuck with me now, man.
I am Ahab.
Jesus Christ.
All right, you weird fucker !
Sit down ! Back in the tub !
I'll plunge this
into your fucking throat.
Don't make me use this, man.
All right, man.
Probably the only solution.
- Let me make sure
I've got this all lined up.
-
You want me to, uh...
throw this into the tub when
"White Rabbit" peaks, is that it ?
Oh, fuck.
I was beginning to think
I was gonna have to go outside...
and get one of
the goddamn maids to do it.
Oh, no. I'll do it.
Shit. What are friends for ?
- ~ I think she'll know ~
- You ready ?
-
- ~ Where logic ~
- Close your eyes.
- ~ And proportion ~
- Yeah, good boy.
-
~ Have fallen
sloppy dead ~
- Rabbit ! White Rabbit !
- Quiet, goddamn it !
You're wasting my time !
Outta here, man ! Get outta here.
~
- ~ Remember ~
- Okay, close those peepers. Ten...
-
- ~ What the dormouse said ~
- nine... hundred and eleven !
- ~ Feed your head ~
Fifty-two !
- ~ Feed your head ~
- Hey ! Hey !
Hey !
-
- I need sleep.
Holy shit !
Mace ! Mace, man.
You want this ?
You'd do that,
wouldn't you?
- Well, why not ?
- You fucking bastard !
Hell, just a minute ago
you were asking me to kill you.
Now you wanna kill me.
What I should do, goddamn it,
is call the fucking police !
Boy, are you upset.
There'd be no point, man,
calling the cops.
There's no choice.
I wouldn't dare go to sleep
with you wandering around
with a head full of acid...
wanting to slice me up
with that goddamn knife.
Who said anything
about slicing you up, man ?
I just wanted to cut
a little "Z" in your forehead.
Get back in the tub.
Eat some reds and try to calm down.
Smoke some grass.
Shoot some fucking smack.
Shit, man, do whatever
you gotta do, but please...
I need some fucking rest,
man. Please. Please.
Get out of here,
you pig fucker !
Up ! Up !
Well, l, uh--
Yeah.
You need to get to work.
Goddamn, what a bummer.
You scurvy
shyster bastard.
-
- I'm a Doctor of Journalism, man.
Go on.
- Don't let me keep you up.
- Now--
Don't let me keep you up.
-
- Get in there and clean your shorts !
Clean your shorts, goddamn it,
like a big boy !
Pig !
The acid had
shifted gears on him.
The next phase would probably be
one of those hellishly intense
introspective nightmares.
Must get some peace.
- Four hours or so of catatonic despair.
-
- Damn drugs.
- Aaaaah !
- Mmm ?
-
Ignore the nightmare
in the bathroom.
Just another ugly refugee
from the love generation.
My attorney had never been
able to accept the notion...
often espoused
by former drug abusers...
that you can get a lot higher
without drugs than with them.
Neither have l,
for that matter.

1965.
The great San Francisco acid wave.
~ When the garden flowers ~
I recall one night in a place
called the Matrix. There I was--
- ~
- Mother of God. There I am.
Holy fuck.
Uh, clearly I was a victim
of the drug explosion...
a natural street freak
just eating whatever came by.
Does anybody want some LSD ?
I got all the makin's...
right here !
All I need is a place to cook.
I decided to eat only
half of the acid at first...
but I spilled the rest on the sleeve
of my red woolen shirt.
What's the trouble ?
Well, all this white stuff...
on my sleeve...
is LSD.
With a bit of luck...
his life
was ruined forever...
always thinking that just behind some
narrow door in all his favorite bars...
men in red woolen shirts...
are getting incredible kicks
from things he'll never know.
