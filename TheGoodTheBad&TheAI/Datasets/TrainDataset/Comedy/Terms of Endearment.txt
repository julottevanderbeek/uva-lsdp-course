Let me go, just for a minute.
You're going to stare
that baby right into a coma.
Stop exaggerating.
It's not good to check
the baby every five minutes...
imagining one terrible thing
or another.
I know, I know.
Here it starts.
Here we go.
Rudyard...
Rudyard, she's not breathing.
Honey, she's sleeping.
The baby's sleeping.
No.
Rudyard, it's crib death.
It's sleep!
She's asleep, honey.
Maybe.
Come on.
Emma.
Oh, good.
There.
That's better.
No, thank you.
Thanks.
Emma?
Uh, he was one of
the most dependable men...
that ever worked for me.
I know. Thank you.
He was a good man.
I'm real sorry
about your daddy.
Take care of your momma.
Emma.
Emma, wake up, please.
Wake up.
What's wrong?
I was tense,
and I was wondering
how you were feeling.
Would you like
to sleep in my bed?
No, thank you.
Would you like to sleep
in my bed again?
Yes!
What are we going
to do with this hair?
Hey, Emma!
Patsy, hurry up!
You're going to miss him.
Oh, that's what
they were looking at?
Good night, honey.
Where's Momma?
Back with that old fart who's
trying to get in her pants.
Wait for the astronaut.
Oh, they got one on
every corner in Houston.
Say hi to Race.
Love ya.
Astronauts!
So?
We better get going.
I'll say good-bye
to my mother.
Want to go with?
No. I don't think
I'm up to it today.
Sure would be nice to have
a mother somebody liked.
Why don't you
face up the fact...
that you have
certain biological needs?
Because I don't.
Mom! I'm going now.
Excuse me.
Can you believe it?
He wants to take me to Tahiti.
I don't know why you
treat these men like this.
They have feelings, too.
Has the astronaut moved in yet?
Who?
Who? Is Patsy teaching
you coy lessons?
Breedlove, Garrett.
Next door.
Has he moved in?
Put your socks up!
Say good-bye to Patsy.
Be home by 11:00.
Say good-bye to Patsy.
Good-bye, Patsy!
Good-bye, Mrs. Greenway.
In this day and age, anything goes.
Times have changed
When they landed on
Plymouth Rock
Any rock they
should try to stem
Instead of landing
on Plymouth Rock
I feel foolish getting stoned
to hear Mary Martin.
See, Patsy,
this is Mary Mar...
This isn't Mary Martin.
This is Ethel Merman.
This is the last time
we'll be like this.
I just plain refuse...
to get into that
kind of thinking.
It shouldn't stop.
I mean, we will be best friends.
Our babies will be best friends.
We'll all be best friends.
Emma?
Oh, God!
Just a minute.
Open the door.
Uh,
Emma, open the door.
Just a minute.
I need to talk to you!
All right.
I'm getting married.
What the hell.
Meet me in my room?
Yes.
What do you think she wants?
Maybe she's going
to tell you how to have sex.
No. She only knows
how to avoid it.
I can't believe
you said that.
I didn't mean it.
I swear.
What have you
been doing, Emma?
Nothing.
What is it, Momma?
I really want to get some sleep...
so I look halfway decent
for tomorrow.
Come on.
What is it?
Would you want me to be
silent about something...
that's for your own good?
Yes, ma'am, I would.
Okay, come on.
I've been in here all night.
I've been trying
to decide what...
what wedding gift
to get you.
I thought of that Renoir
that my mother gave me.
But I couldn't reach a conclusion.
Then I came to grips
with the reason why...
I couldn't think
of your wedding gift.
It's all right.
I need dishes,
Corningware,
a rotisserie...
the car,
a house.
Emma,
I'm totally convinced...
if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,
it will be a mistake
of such gigantic proportions,
it'll ruin your life and
make wretched your destiny.
Why are you doing this to me?
You're not special enough...
to overcome a bad marriage.
Emma, use your brains.
Flap is limited.
He has no imagination.
All he wants
is a secure teaching job.
Mother,
I'm marrying Flap tomorrow.
I thank God Flap's
getting me out of here.
If this is your attitude,
don't come to my wedding.
Hmm,
that... that's right.
No, I think you're right.
The hypocrisy
was bothering me, too.
My own mother's
not coming to my wedding.
Listen to her.
She's going crazy.
I'll give her until
noon tomorrow.
Emma, your mother
boycotted your wedding,
she hates your husband,
and she only holds you
in medium esteem.
Medium esteem.
That is so cute.
That is so cute.
Wouldn't it have been strange...
if one of us married
a person who didn't read?
There's millions
of interesting people...
who never pick up a book.
Flap, I feel so
totally good about us.
I hope I get
pregnant tonight.
That would be nice.
Ah-choo!
Emma,
I love the way you look.
Uh,
you were...
you're so nice.
I'm...
You're my sweet-ass gal.
Oh.
Ah-choo!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Here comes the bride!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
How do you do that?
Flap, where did you
learn how to do that?
That is the strangest music
to make love to.
I know.
Leave me alone.
I'm happy.
I don't want to talk to you.
Did you see the tablecloth
Rosie gave me?
It's got red flowers on it.
She made it.
No, not yet.
I made omelets.
I started them.
Kind of Tex-Mex.
No.
That was the worst thing...
you've ever done to me.
I think you owe
my husband an apology.
Until you apologize,
I won't listen to your gossip.
He's right here.
Hold on.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
No!
Yes!
Hello, Mrs. Greenway.
No, ma'am, I am not
enjoying your predicament.
Momma, be nice!
As a matter of fact,
I don't need an apology.
All I want is
for you to understand...
and appreciate my position,
to respect our marriage,
and to wait another 15 minutes...
before you call in the morning.
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.
Okay. I'll put her on.
He's so great!
I'll talk to you later.
I don't care
about the neighborhood.
Can't you stay
a little while longer?
I thought we were
having a real good time.
Don't go yet.
One more minute.
I've got something to show you.
No, really.
Thanks.
Good night.
I bought you something.
What?
A tie.
Emma,
you didn't buy this for me.
You were worried about
how I'd look to your mother.
Now, stop being a quisling
where she is concerned.
Why is it whenever I get
happy, you turn perverse?
Buying this made you happy?
Yes. Yes!
I wish you could understand this,
'cause you really don't.
It made me very happy,
buying this tie.
I went to two or three places
before finding it.
Then describing your jacket
to the salesman,
and knowing
how perfect it would match.
Which, by the way,
it certainly does.
I mean, it was fun!
It was a goddamn Mardi Gras!
You're too dumb to understand
that kind of happiness.
I'm sorry.
I'm being terrible.
Going to your mother's,
it makes me
a little irrational.
Can I help?
Yes. Thank you, Flap.
Take this candle.
I need another one.
In the kitchen?
Yes.
That looks great.
Who's that short gentleman?
Not that it's any
of your business, but...
Just leave it at that.
What are you looking at?
She isn't there anymore.
She'll be back.
I'm Edward Johnson,
Aurora's friend.
Pleased to meet you.
Vernon Dahlart.
God, isn't she something?
Here she comes.
I met her two weeks ago
at church.
You might say she's
God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.
Then you like her?
Oh, no. Does it show?
Good food.
I served this
when I lived in Boston.
Vernon, you haven't said a word.
Is that right?
I feel like
I haven't stopped talking.
I guess because I've been
thinking about you so much.
Can I suggest
how to handle me?
Yes, ma'am.
Don't worship me
until I've earned it.
Thank you, ma'am.
I appreciate any advice
you can give me.
Don't talk
with your mouth full, Vern.
I wouldn't do that.
I just did it to make you laugh.
What's wrong with you?
I got some good news.
What's that?
I'm unofficially pregnant.
We haven't gotten
the tests back yet,
but you know me...
I'm never late.
Well,
I don't understand.
Um, if you're not happy for me...
I'm going to get so mad
if you're not happy.
Why should I...
Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?
You won't be knitting
the baby any booties?
Flap,
every time you get
more than two drinks,
you confront me.
And I won't have it.
I won't have it,
not in this house.
Excuse me.
Do you need some help?
No. I'll be fine,
as soon as I stretch my legs.
Oh, God.
Mr. Breedlove.
You're bleeding.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Come on in.
No, thank you.
What are you afraid of?
Afraid?
Well,
why not...
Why not come on in?
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,
'cause you're drunk,
and because when I went
to see an astronaut...
give a lecture,
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us.
I didn't expect some silly flirt...
to keep his jacket open...
because his belly's
getting too big.
I expected a hero.
Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.
I don't want you in my house.
Lee Anne, would you like
to come in?
You better tend to that cut.
Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on.
How can you dress him like that?
He's adorable.
Look at him.
Oh.
Oh, great, Tommy.
Uh-oh.
That's Vernon.
So tell I'm, uh...
Out?
No. Tell him I'm resting.
Hello.
Hi, Flap.
Where?
No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.
Oh, Flap, you didn't
expect I'd be happy.
Let's be honest
with each other...
before we start pretending.
Um, look, Mom's
staring at me right now,
so can I talk about it
later to you?
Yeah.
All right.
Bye.
How long are you going
to keep this a secret?
The only school accepting Flap
for his associate professorship...
is in Des Moines.
He can't even do
the simple things,
like fail locally.
It's going to be fine, Momma.
It's Des Moines.
Say, "Bye-bye, house."
Bye-bye, house.
Be careful going down
these steps.
Don't break your leg.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Stay sweet, honey.
Rosie...
Uh, that's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.
Tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.
Have some fun, Rosie.
Don't act so brave.
I know you'll go crazy
without me to nag.
You be good to her
or else we'll get you.
I mean it.
Bye, Flap.
Have a good drive.
Okay, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.
Momma, that's the first time...
I stopped hugging first.
I like that.
Get yourself
a decent maternity dress.
Had to get one in, didn't you?
Did you tell her, Patsy?
She keeps thinking it's me.
Tom,
will you be good
to your mother...
and take care of her?
Bye, Mrs. Greenway.
Good-bye.
Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.
Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.
You shape up, Patsy.
Oops!
Dropped my gum.
We'll get you another piece.
The phone bill will be
enormous, you know that?
I'll miss you, Momma.
Can we go now?
Yeah. Pull away slow.
It will be good for us...
to be away from your...
From our families.
I miss Houston.
You don't know
how lucky you are.
Everybody wants to go
to Des Moines.
People come to get
one look at Des Moines...
before they die.
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.
I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!
I think you should stop worrying.
You'll see some
terrific new things.
We are.
Oohhh!
Ahhooo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Hold it down!
Have some respect
for other people's feelings!
Come over a little closer.
Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you.
I took a sauna.
It's hard not to yell...
when you hit cold water.
You're ignoring me
when I speak?
What am I supposed to say?
It's hard not to yell...
when you hit cold water.
Hey, uh, come here.
Come here?
What is your name?
Aurora?
Yes.
You-You want a shock?
No, not especially.
What?
Well, we're going to have this...
dinner at, uh...
NASA dinner at the White House.
You know, some cosmonauts,
and all of us...
I didn't know
who I could take.
All the people I flew with,
their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back...
if I show up
with one of my regular girls.
I didn't know
anybody old enough,
so I thought, "Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbor."
Well, anyway, they
canceled the dinner,
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.
Seriously.
Ain't that a shocker?
Yes.
Imagine you having a date
with someone...
where it wasn't necessarily
a felony.
What would you have said
if I asked you?
Seriously.
I would've said I'd like
to see the White House.
So you would've come.
What the hell.
You want to have dinner
out sometime?
No, thank you.
What about lunch?
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot.
There's something
about your manner.
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.
This is the element.
Do you want to play, Aurora?
Want to have lunch?
We'll have lunch.
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant...
to improve the atmosphere
in this neighborhood,
I wouldn't exactly say no.
Come here.
We're too far apart to talk.
Now,
Aurora,
since you've agreed,
why don't we just
forget about the rest?
I mean, I know how you feel.
There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.
I said to myself,
"You agreed to do it.
"You're strapped in,
"and you're in the hands...
"of something bigger and
more powerful than yourself.
"So, uh, why don't you just...
lay back and enjoy the ride?"
I'm not going.
There's something
wrong with you.
Oh, God.
I'm such a shit.
Wait! That must be it.
Right there? Oh, God!
Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?
Oh, it's great.
Isn't that sweet?
Oh, that was a bump.
Oh, yeah.
What is that?
Shall we go see the house?
You stay there.
Come on.
Let's get this off.
Come on.
Whoa! Come on.
Oh, sweetheart,
did you hurt yourself?
Nope, not yet.
Do you like it?
Do you like it?
Oh, it's great.
Flap, it's great.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Oh!
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.
I'm really tired.
Ow! Ow!
You ever made love in Iowa?
Tommy's room is on
the other side of the hall,
so we can get noisy.
Good. You get to make
your little high-pitched squeak.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Flap, what about you?
What about you?
Here I come.
Here I come again.
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Here I come again.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, God.
You just made me wet.
How can you do that
with your voice?
You just make
your voice like that.
If Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy.
He's fine, Mother.
Don't get pissy.
I'll be right back.
I have papers to grade.
This isn't love, it's selfishness.
It's been a week
since we've been together.
We've never gone a week.
Sure, we have.
Only in the real pregnant months.
You're always getting home late.
Do me a favor.
Don't make me feel silly,
I won't make you feel guilty.
Fair enough.
I have to hurry.
Be a good boy.
Emma?
I love that you came back.
You're saving our lives
by doing this.
Tommy, breakfast
will be ready in a minute.
Hurry. I've got
to grade those papers.
I'll give everybody a "B".
Come on.
No, wait.
Emma, come on.
Emma!
Wait. Wait.
Hello.
Hi, Mother.
Could we talk later?
I've got to get the boys off.
Don't be so inconsiderate.
I'm all set to have a good talk.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Stop right here.
Tell me what it is.
Okay, Mother.
I need some money.
I need you
to loan me some money.
I really need it, so will you?
Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.
You know that was hard for me.
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.
Thinking what?
How much I hate
to part with money.
I wouldn't have asked if...
Don't yell,
but I think that
I may be pregnant again.
Oh! No!
And you're going
to have it, I suppose.
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?
Don't act like that's so terrible.
Bright young women
are having simple abortions.
Simple?
Then they get wonderful jobs.
You can have it in Colorado.
Why do I tell you anything?
I like you less and less.
You know why, Emma?
It's because only I
tell you the truth.
Go get dressed.
How will your life get better...
if you keep having his children?
What miracle will come
to rescue you?
Leave me alone.
I need the money.
Give me the painting to sell.
No! That's your security.
I will not have you
using that for rent.
Let's not do this.
All right?
I'll talk to you later, all right?
All right.
If the money would mean...
No, don't. It would
make you crazy.
Yes, it would.
We'll talk later.
Call me tonight if you want.
Good-bye.
Daddy just got home.
Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?
Boy.
Great news.
I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.
What's wrong?
Where have you been
all night, Flap?
I fell asleep on that big sofa...
at the library again.
I don't know
what's wrong with me.
I'm on to you.
I'm not doing anything.
Oh, yes, you are.
We go through this stage every...
Don't change the subject.
What's the subject?
That I'm on to you.
You wouldn't look so innocent...
unless you were guilty.
You'll have to
take my word for it.
You have no other choice.
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
Whoa!
Excuse me.
Emma, you always
get a little paranoid...
in your first few months, okay?
Just...
If you are doing something...
and trying to make me
feel crazy because I'm pregnant,
you may have sunk so low...
you'll never recover.
You may have just panicked,
and trying to save yourself,
you've thrown out
your character and principles.
The only way you could
redeem yourself...
is to admit anything...
that you might have
been doing last night.
If you don't do that,
you are a lost man.
A shell.
A bag of shit dust.
You've got to tell me.
For us, honey.
Hello.
Hello, Aurora.
How are you?
Yes, she's...
She's right here.
Nice to hear your voice again.
Why don't you get a job?
What about the baby?
It's a great day
when you get tenure!
All tenure means...
is we won't have
enough money forever!
Why won't you ask your mother?
At your convenience, right?
Go ahead! Call her!
Why should today be any different?
Get on the phone, Emma!
Why don't you call?
Yeah, I'll call Aurora, right?
Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!
Mommy said to wait right here.
Just stay if you want.
What are you guys doing here?
I said to wait
in front of the house.
Answer me, Tommy.
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.
That'll do till you're ten.
You're driving Daddy away.
Tommy, stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you.
Hurry up.
I said hurry. Come on!
$44.
Let's see.
That's 38, 40...
You don't have enough money?
I don't have any checks,
so I'll put some things back.
Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!
It's no big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.
Here, take this.
$43.75.
$41.35.
Mom, you promised
I could have something.
I won't give her real food.
Give her this.
No way!
$40.35.
Mom!
All right.
Here.
$40.55.
$40.75. We're going
in the wrong direction.
Why must you be so nasty?
I mean, it's not going
to help anything.
We're both people, you know?
$40.75.
I don't need it.
Mrs. Horton,
I'm Sam Burns from the bank.
I turned down
the second on your house.
Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.
Can I help you
make up the difference?
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.
You're a very rude young woman.
I know Douglas from the Rotary.
I can't believe he'd want you
treating customers so badly.
I don't think I was
treating her badly.
Then you must be from New York.
Be careful, Teddy!
What?
Be careful!
Where's your car?
Right here.
That was worst time I've ever had.
I didn't know I could get
cheered up so fast.
No problem.
Come on, Mom.
Wait by the car.
Come on.
Wait.
No.
Wait by the car, honey.
But...
Wait, honey!
Over by the car!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Nice boys.
You're great with them, too.
Really.
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.
Hey, thanks again.
Oh, no thanks required.
I've had a lovely time.
Me, too.
I'll get the money back to you.
You can drop it
in the mail, if you like.
To the bank?
Sure. You could even use
a check-by-mail envelope.
Or, uh, you could come in.
Whichever.
Maybe I'll come in sometime.
Well, that'd be fine.
Can I help you with that?
No, thanks.
I'm used to this.
And so another birthday...
for a gal named Aurora Greenway.
Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away.
Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky.
A heavenly object, a siren's cry.
You're the best.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Edward.
Thank you.
Do you want one, Vernon?
Would you like a kiss?
You're not lying
about your age, are you?
Of course not.
I thought you were 52.
How do you expect
to fool a family doctor?
She said her age.
The number doesn't matter,
but its concealment does.
Why does he keep talking?
Dr. Ratcher...
The way to adjust to old age...
Doctor, I think
you're a mite confused...
because of being
recently widowed and all.
You okay?
Hmm?
Aurora?
Aurora?
Let's give her some privacy.
Yeah?
The door's open.
Just a minute.
Well, hello.
Hi.
I was curious if you still
wanted to take me to lunch.
I wasn't aware that we...
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.
A few years back?
Does the invitation still exist?
Would you like to?
To lunch.
Not dinner, remember.
It was lunch.
Why not? No.
Good.
When?
Uh...
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
All right.
All right.
Good.
Good.
If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.
No. Don't worry.
Grown women are prepared...
for life's little emergencies.
Us going out together...
Not bad, huh?
Do you think,
could you possibly put the top up?
The top's at home in the garage.
Hello. How are you?
How are you, Ali?
It's nice to see you.
That guy, Fred, at that bar?
He asked me out.
Oh, God.
He took me to the Cadillac Bar.
It's a fun place...
if you're with the right people,
but I wasn't.
Well,
I'm starving.
No hidden meaning
in that remark.
Well, uh...
Would you like an oyster?
No.
Thank you.
It's good.
I think that is extremely rude,
noticing other women
when you're with me.
I, um...
think we're going
to have to get drunk.
I don't get drunk,
and I don't care
for escorts who do.
You got me into this.
Trust me about this one thing.
You need a lot of drinks.
To break the ice?
To kill the bug
that you have up your ass.
May I get you something?
I will have some bourbon,
preferably Wild Turkey.
Aurora?
You're not fun,
by any chance?
We shouldn't think
about that right now.
Impatient boys
sometimes miss dessert.
We both got here
at the same time.
Hi, Sam.
It's nice to see you.
It's always nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.
You, too.
What I didn't expect was
that there'd be moments...
where I'd forget to be scared...
that someone
would see us together.
You don't have to be scared.
Contemplating sin
is all we've done.
I'm glad you've been
contemplating it, too.
I didn't know that.
Well, all these lunches,
all this hand-holding.
I'm not going
back to the bank this afternoon.
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.
It's pretty far out, and...
Well, it's empty.
I've got to pick up
my kids at 5:00.
Okay. I understand.
Don't give it a thought.
Emma,
I haven't made love
to a woman...
in almost three years.
How come?
My wife has a disc problem,
and she can't take having...
any weight on her.
I hope you don't
mind me asking this,
but have you ever thought of
your wife getting on top?
Oh, she wouldn't do that.
She may surprise you.
No. I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.
Did you ask?
About 600 times.
What are you thinking?
Do you prefer Texas to Iowa?
What were you really thinking?
That's what I was thinking
when you just asked me that.
There seems to be
an absence of wildness,
even in the people.
Well, we're farmers,
and we talk poor...
because the farmer
aspect of things is,
"Don't let anybody know
you have anything,
and don't call attention
to yourself."
My wife says...
I guess we shouldn't
talk about Dotty.
Wind in the hair!
Lead in the pencil!
Feet controlling the universe!
Breedlove at the helm!
Just keep pumping that throttle!
Keep giving it that gas!
I see the Gulf of Mexico!
I'm not enjoying this!
Give it a chance.
I'm going to stop!
How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.
If you wanted to
get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.
Aah!
Oww! My hand!
Get it out!
I can't! I swear!
I swear to God!
We were having a good time,
then you had to go do this!
Please, anything!
Bend down!
Bend down!
Why did you have to get drunk?
I am not drunk...
Anymore!
The pain sobered me up.
No!
Emma, this might be
a terrible thing to ask,
but are you thinking
about your husband?
A little.
We can go back.
No, Sam. Stop it.
Look, I want to do this.
I'm glad I don't know whether
Flap's been with someone else.
I'd hate to think I was
doing this just to get even.
Oh, just fucking great!
Fine.
Great.
You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!
Thank you!
Would you like to come in?
I'd rather stick
needles in my eyes.
Everything would've been fine...
if you hadn't gotten drunk.
Don't think I'm like
one of your other girls.
No danger in that
unless you curtsy
on my face real soon.
Garrett!
What is it that makes you...
so insistent on
shocking and insulting me?
I really hate
that way of talking.
You must know that.
Why do you do it?
I'll tell you, Aurora.
I don't know what
it is about you,
but you do bring out
the devil in me.
Where are you?
In the laundry room,
so nobody could hear.
But I can't hear you either.
-
- Wait a minute.
We're getting a quieter cycle.
Okay.
Can you hear now?
Yeah.
Is it bad to call?
No. I'm in the market
for sweet talk.
-
-  Mom, I have to go!
Really!
Hurry up.
What is it?
Just how absolutely good I feel.
And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,
no matter what happens,
I'm just so grateful
to God or the Devil...
for letting me
feel this way again.
I'm glad you told me that.
Don't flush.
You said to.
Not this time.
Emma, is everything okay?
It's all right.
Can I hold Melanie?
Yes.
Honey, is everything okay?
What?
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine.
I have
an emergency phone call...
from Mrs. Aurora Greenway
in Houston, Texas...
Oh, no!
She does that
when the line's busy.
Of course. We were just talking.
I'll talk to you later, Sam. Bye.
Hi. How'd it go?
The astronaut is impossible.
An arrogant, self-centered,
and, yes, somewhat
entertaining man...
who has realized his ambition,
and is at last a spoiled child.
A match made in heaven.
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
He doesn't want anything more
to do with me.
Oh? Why?
Let's not go into it.
Because you wouldn't go to bed?
On a first date?
It's hardly a first date.
You've lived next door for 15 years.
Why don't you talk
about the real reason?
I don't know what you mean.
It's been that long
since you've done it.
Shut up! Shut up!
It's just me. Call him.
No! I'm hanging up.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm hanging up.
So long.
Oh!
Hello.
Hello, Garrett.
Yes?
Well, I was just
sitting here realizing...
Realizing that I'd never
shown you my Renoir.
What are you talking about?
I'm inviting you to come over...
and look at my Renoir.
You're inviting me to bed.
Yes, it happens to be
in my bedroom.
Is the Renoir under the covers?
Don't cackle, Garrett.
Do you want to see it?
Do I want to
come to your bedroom?
Let me think.
Do you?
Just... Just...
Just give me a minute.
It's...
It's a tough one.
Um...
I guess... I don't know.
Yeah, okay.
I guess so.
Sure. Why not?
I'll see you in a bit.
If I don't answer the bell,
the back door's open.
The back door's open.
My God. He ran it.
Hi.
I was doing laps when you called.
Lucky for us,
I only did eight.
This is it.
This is the Renoir.
I like it.
