FILM NARRATOR:
Welcome to Sheffield...
the beating heart of Britain's
industrial North.
The jewel
in Yorkshire's crown...
is home to over
half a million people...
and thousands more flock here
daily to shop and to work.
All this is built on Sheffield's
primary industry--steel.
The city's rolling mills,
forges, and workshops...
employ some 90,000 men and
state-of-the-art machinery...
to make
the world's finest steel--
from high-tensile girders
to the stainless cutlery...
that ends up
on your dining table.
But it's not all hard work
for the people of Steel City.
They can spend the day
lounging by the pool...
watching
one of our top soccer teams...
or browsing in the shops.
But when the sun goes down,
the fun really starts...
in the city's numerous
nightclubs and discotheques.
yes, Yorkshire  folk
know how to have a good time...
and it's good times
for the city's housing, too.
Sheffield
leads the way in town planning.
Victorian slums
have been cleared...
to make way
for the homes of the future.
Thanks to steel...
Sheffield
really is a city on the move.
DAVE: Gaz,
who's gonna buy a rusty girder?
GAZ: Come on.
NATHAN: Dad, it's stealing.
GAZ: No. It's liberating, luv.
Liberating.
DAVE: Gaz, hang on.
GAZ: Ten years
we worked in here, and now look.
NATHAN: What if we get caught?
GAZ: you don't get a criminal
record till you're sixteen.
-Just don't tell your mom.
-Hey, listen.
DAVE: Music.
NATHAN: yeah.
GAZ: Bloody hell.
GAZ: What are they doing?
NATHAN: It's the factory band.
They're still going.
DAVE: About the only thing
around here that is.
Eh up, security guard's back.
DAVE:
"Won't take a minute," he says.
"Won't take a minute." Now what?
GAZ: Shut up. I'm thinking.
NATHAN: Can't we do
normal things sometimes?
GAZ: What's up with you?
This is normal.
DAVE:
Oh, aye, everyday stuff, this.
I think this bugger's sinking.
GAZ: Right. Now pick it up...
and try and slide it
across other side.
That's it.
Oh, fucking hell, Nathe!
They're twenty quid each, them.
That were your bloody
maintenance, were that.
Oh, shit.
DAVE: Oh, nice one.
GAZ: Nathe.
Nathan.
Fuckin' hell!
DAVE: Come here, come here.
GAZ: Jesus, stay still.
Stay still, stay still.
All right.
DAVE: What's your initiative
say about this, bog eyes?
GAZ: Eh up. Someone coming.
MAN: All right?
GAZ: Ah, not so bad.
DAVE: Not so bad? Not so bad?
That's not much
of a chuffing SOS, is it?
GAZ:
All right, don't get a benny on.
Shit.
DAVE:
My jeans are bloody soaking.
GAZ: Should have taken
your kit off. you shy?
DAVE:
Don't. Just shut it, all right?
DAVE: Ohh.
GAZ: Eh up, Dave.
-All right, babe.
-Dad.
-What do you reckon, Dave?
-Eight, maybe a nine.
GAZ: you can never tell till
you see their tits, can you?
-Dad!
-What's all this, then?
NATHAN:
It's them Chippendale efforts.
GAZ: What?
NATHAN: Them dancers.
Mum were going on about it.
GAZ: Aw, you're joking.
She must be getting desperate.
DAVE: Away, Gaz.

WOMAN: yeah, to go home.
GAZ: you know where to find me
when you're tired of them poofs.
DAVE: Gaz, I'm freezing.
GAZ: "Women only"?
Cheeky buggers.
It's a bloody
working men's club.
I mean,
look at the state of that.
I don't know
what you've got to smile about.
I mean, he's got no willy
for starters, has he?
There's nowt in the gym
that'll help you there, mate.
No decent woman would be
seen dead in there.
Jean would.
Oh, Dave, what's going on?
It's her money, isn't it?
Fucking hell.
you gonna just stand there...
while some poof's waving
his tackle at your missis?
Where's your pride, man?
She's already got you hoovering.
I saw it, and I let it go.
But this, no, no, no.
you get her out of there
and tell her what for.
NATHAN:
He can't. It's women only.
DAVE: Just hurry up, will you?
Me feet have gone numb.
GAZ: That's gratitude for you.
We're riding into "Alley
of Death" for you, you fat git.
DAVE: It's not my fault
I can't fit through, is it?
GAZ: All right, then.
I'll be waiting here,
keeping guard.
you tell Auntie Jean Uncle Dave
wants a word outside, all right?
-Do I have to?
-Good kid. On you go.
WOMEN:
Off! Off! Off! Off!
JEAN: Ooh, I'm not waiting
in that bloody queue.
SHARON: I've always wanted
a nosey in the men's toilet.
BEE: Phoor, them bloody muscles.
JEAN: No, no,
it's not their bodies, Bee.
It's what they do with them
that counts.
SHARON: I don't know
what you're worrying about...
you-know-who on your tail.
BEE SINGING:
Frankie, do you want my body?
JEAN:
Hey, Frank don't fancy me...
and I don't fancy Frank,
so bloody well give over.
Do you think he might, though?
No, couldn't do that to Dave.
Not even if I wanted to.
But it's like he's given up.
Work, me, everything.
Ah, luv.
Here, luv, this'll cheer you up.
BEE: I weren't
in Girl Scouts for nothing.
DAVE: Gaz.
Gaz.
That were our Jean, weren't it?
GAZ: No, no.
Just a couple of old tarts.
Going back in for Nathe.
GAZ: you're in big trouble.
NATHAN: What about Auntie Jean?
GAZ: Auntie Jean's busy.
NATHAN: I don't feel well.
GAZ: Of course you don't.
you've got an hangover.
Take a day off.
Hang about at home.
NATHAN: your house is messy.
It's cold and all.
GAZ: Then come down Jobclub.
That'll be a right laugh.
NATHAN:
Mum's house is always warm.
GAZ: I can't always have
the red carpet out for you.
Anyway,
it's not your mum's house.
It's what's-his-name--Barry's.
Tell you what.
Next weekend,
I'll have a big tidy around.
I promise.
Even go and see a footie game.
NATHAN: yeah?
GAZ: yeah. Sunday League
going down the park...
has got some right good players.
NATHAN: United playing Man U,
aren't they?
GAZ: Oh, Nathe, you know
I can't stretch to that.
NATHAN: you're always
making me do stupid stuff.
Other dads don't do that.
GAZ: Don't they? Aye.
NATHAN: Aye.
GAZ: Hey, Nathe.
We could try
and sneak into Man U.
Terry were telling us
about this gap in fence.
NATHAN: No!
GAZ: All right.
I'll get tickets. I will.
Ooh, ah, Cantona,
has to wear a girlie bra.
Stuff 'em, Nathe.
Fuck.
MANAGER: I want your
application letters finished...
by the time I get back, right?
Any problems, I'm outside.
GAZ: I tell you, when women
start pissing like us...
that's it.
We're finished, Dave.
Extincto.
DAVE: yeah, I mean, how?
you know?
TERRY:
Genetic mutations, isn't it?
They're turning into us.
GAZ: A few years,
and men won't exist...
except in a zoo or something.
We're not needed no more,
are we?
Obsolete. Dinosaurs.
yesterday's news.
Like skateboards.
GERALD: Button it. Some of us
are trying to get a job.
Hey, it says no smoking in here.
GAZ: Oh, and it says
Jobclub up there...
and when were the last time
you saw one of them walk in?
you forget, Gerald,
you're not our foreman anymore.
you're just like
the rest of us--scrap.
Shut it, right?
DAVE: Hang on, then.
Why were all them women
in working men's club?
Now, then,
because of us--men.
GAZ:
you call them Chippendales men?
Degrading, that's what it were.
How many lasses were there,
though?
Thousands, baying for blood.
Ten quid to watch some fucking
poof get his kit off.
DAVE: Right. Times ten quid
by a thousand, right?
And you've got...
yeah, well, a lot--a very lot.
Ten thousand quid.
-How much?
-Ten thousand quid.
Hey, now, Dave, it's worth
a thought, though, isn't it?
GERALD: Oh, aye. Could just see
Little and Large...
prancing around Sheffield
with their widgers hanging out.
Now that would be worth
ten quid.
GAZ: Don't be so bloody daft.
We were just saying--
GERALD: Widgers on parade.
Bring your own microscope.
I don't see
why the chuff not, Gerald.
Because you're fat,
and he's thin...
and you're both fucking ugly.
GAZ: Fucking bastard.
GAZ: What's all this
about sole custody?
you know what it is, Gary.
If you want joint custody,
you have to pay your share--
seven hundred quid.
I'm on dole,
in case you hadn't noticed.
Then get a job.
I'll get you a job.
At two pound fifty an hour in
black hole of fucking Calcutta?
No, thank you.
Fine. If you want to go off
and play your games, Gary...
then you do that, but Nathan's
gonna have two parents.
GAZ: your bloody live-in lover's
gonna do that, is he?
Abracadabra.
Here he is. Evening, Barry.
That'll be for court to decide.
No, it won't.
Nathan's yours and he's mine...
and he's fuck all
to do with him !
BARRY:
As if you've ever given a toss.
MANDY: Face it, Gary.
He don't even like
staying at your house.
Of course he bloody does.
Ask him.
Ask him.
Nathe,
we have a laugh, don't we, kid?
Gary, don't.
GAZ: Is he in? Is he in?!
Nathe!
Well, he can't hear you through
your triple bloody glazing.
MANDY: He can hear, all right.
This is all wrong, this is.
It's all to fucking cock.
I'm his dad,
and you, you're nobody.
Yorkshire: Good night, Gary.
GAZ: Night, Nathe.
See you, kid.
DAVE: No, not doing it.
I'm not stripping.
GAZ:
Dave, they're taking him away.
All I need
is seven hundred quid.
DAVE: Gaz, no.
GAZ: Dave, he's me kid.
I suppose there's nicking cars.
-No.
-Well, then?
DAVE: Look, I'll help.
I'm running now, aren't l?
But I'm taking nowt off, final.
GAZ:
Come on, Dave. Don't stop now.
Keep up, you fat bastard.
DAVE: Gazza, you tosser.
DAVE: you need a hand?
yeah, it's your HT leads,
I reckon.
Give it a go at that.
DAVE: Didn't you work at
Harrisons before it shut down?
yeah, thought I clocked you.
I were on't floor with Gaz,
him up the road.
How's it going, then?
you got any work?
No, there's not a lot about,
is there?
Like I say, get some new ones
when you get the chance.
No, no, my chuffing pleasure.
GAZ: Dave?
-Are you all right, kid?
-you bastard.
LOMPER: Hey, hey!
you could shoot yourself.
GAZ: Where's he gonna
find a gun around here?
you want to find yourself
a big bridge, you do.
DAVE: yeah, like one of them
bungee jumps...
only without the bungee bit.
I can't stand heights, me.
DAVE: Drowning.
Now there's a way to go.
I can't swim.
GAZ: you don't have
to fucking swim, you divvy.
That's the whole point.
God, you're not very keen,
are you?
Sorry.
I know.
you could stand
in middle of road...
and get a mate to drive
smack into you right fast.
Haven't got any mates.
GAZ: Listen, we just saved
your fucking life...
so don't tell us
we're not your mates, all right?
Really?
DAVE: yeah. I'd run you down
soon as look at you.
Oh, cheers.
Ta.
Thanks a lot.
-What are you doing, Mum?
-Where have you been?
LOMPER: Driving.
MOTHER: Driving where?
LOMPER: Just driving.
MOTHER: I thought you'd gone.
GAZ: Security guard in here?
No wonder
he wants to kill himself.
DAVE:
At least one bloke got a job...
out of this place
being shut down.
What did you tell him for,
any road? Kid's a nutter.
GAZ: He's a bugle player.
Could come in right handy.
Might need a bit of music.
He's got a car...
somewhere to practice.
Besides, good what's-its-name
for the lad--therapy.
DAVE: Oh, aye, jiggling about
in the buff, therapy.
He won't be the only one
trying to kill himself...
if you carry on
with this caper.
NATHAN: Dad, I'm hungry.
GAZ: Eh up.
DAVE: Hey, Lomper...
where's me rice?
Try the cylinder head, tubby.
NATHAN: I don't like Chinese.
GAZ:
Of course you do, don't you?
DAVE: Let's see his records.
GAZ: What we got, then, Dave?
DAVE: "The Floral Dance."
-"Marching with Hepworth."
-Jesus Christ.
DAVE: Ah, "Hot Chocolate."

We're not doing this
for a laugh, you know.
I'm trying to get
some brass together...
so as you and me

They're trying to stop us,

Well, I may as well not bother,

DAVE: He's not bad
for a bastard, is he?
GAZ:
He's dead, that's what he is.
LOMPER: you said you wanted

DAVE: Gerald? Go get chuffed.
He'll tell every bugger.
We'll be laughed

Very nifty footwork.
LINDA: Gerald. Oh, hello.
We're missing the rumba.
GERALD: Sorry, luv. I was
just having a bit of a chat...
with some pals of mine
from work.
LINDA: Oh.
Not thinking
of joining our class?

Funny you should mention it.
GERALD: I think we'd better be

LINDA: Well, good night.
GAZ: Get back to your rumba.
We'll see you later, Gerald.
At work.

GAZ: Aye, he bloody would have.
LINDA: Things looking up?
GERALD: Do you know, luv,
I think they just might be.
LINDA: Good.

About time you let
one of your colleagues...

for a change.
I wish you'd be firmer, Gerald.
GERALD: Mustn't be late.

Mate. I know him from Harrisons.
And I could do the job
standing on me head.
And I won't have to look
at your ugly mugs ever again.
GAZ: We just need a bit of help.
GERALD: I'm sorry, pal.
There's nothing I can do
to help the likes of you.
DAVE: Just want to know
about dancing, that's all.
GERALD: Dancers

timing, fitness, and grace.
Take a long, hard look
in the mirror.
Now, I'm busy.
Don't be late for Jobclub, lads.
Bastard.
DIRECTOR:
Starting at sixteen thousand...
plus the pension scheme.
GERALD: It'll be a relief

All the qualifications

She's out there now,

Why can't you just tell her?
How can I tell her
after six months?
A woman who wants to go
skiing for us holidays.
Skiing, for fuck's sake!
Why did you do it?
It was my job!
It had to be my...job.
GERALD:
Can't you just leave me alone?
DAVE: Stuck it with Superglue.

Look.
-Go on.

Wheels go round and everything.
DAVE: It's for your gnomes,

GERALD: Ta, lads, eh?
Ta very much.
GAZ: Cigarette, for fuck's sake.

GAZ: A Yorkshire  version.
If them buggers can,
we bloody can.
-you can't dance.
-We know, Gerald.
DAVE: Look, Gaz,
niner on its way.
GAZ: Why do you think we're
trailing you all over town?
GERALD: I don't know.
It's not my kind of dancing.
It's all arse-wiggling.
GAZ: I've got a degree
in arse-wiggling, mate.
you learn us dancing,
I'll learn you rest.
Look, Gerald,
for once, I'm dead serious.
I need your help.

What's got into you?
DAVE: No, would you, though?
JEAN: I might do, yeah.
Is that all right?
DAVE: So it's true, then.
JEAN: I've bloody had enough
of this. What's true?
DAVE: What they say

They've got great bodies
and that.

And?

GAZ: It's "Flashdance."
She's a welder, isn't she?
DAVE: A welder?
I hope she dances
better than she welds.
Look at that.
Her mix is all to cock.
GAZ: What the fuck do you know
about welding, any road?
DAVE:
More than some chuffing woman.
It's like Bonfire Night.
That's too much acetylene.
Them joints won't hold fuck all.
GERALD: Dave, we're looking
for dancing, aren't we?
GAZ:
He's got the hump about ASDA.
LOMPER: Hey. Cop a load of that.
IRENE CARA SINGING:
What a feelin'
I hear music now
GERALD: What did I tell you?
She's nifty on her pins.
IRENE CARA SINGING:
you just come alive...
GERALD: That, gentlemen,
is what we are looking for.
DAVE: I can see him doing all
that twizzling about bollocks.
GERALD:
It's souped-up tango is that.
Teach any bugger in a week.
Even you, mate.
Even a fat bastard like me?
yeah, I know what I am,
so don't take the piss, you.
All right.
Two weeks.
LOMPER: Straight up.
IRENE CARA SINGING:
What a feeling
I can have it all
Being is believing
Being is believing...
DAVE: I don't know, Gaz.
Jean reckons I should take...
that security guard job
down at ASDA.
GAZ: Jesus! Security?
you're worth
more than that, Dave.
DAVE: Jean don't think so.
I reckon there's summat going
on with her and that bloke.
GAZ: The juggling bugger?
No. No way.
DAVE: Not as if I blame her.
GAZ: you can show her, Dave.
Nobody tells them Chippendales
to go be security, do they?
Rakin' it in, they are.
Two weeks.
That's what the man said,
and he's not taking the piss.
DAVE: It's a thought.
It's more than a thought.
you think of Jean's face
when she sees you...
dancing like old fucking
"Flashdance."
Two weeks?
Just like flashy tits?
GAZ: That's what your man said.
Hey.
I can weld better
than her and all.
GAZ: Ha ha!
GERALD: Stop! No! No! Stop!
LOMPER: What?
GERALD: you stay still...
and you go forward, OK?
-OK.
-All right, Nathan.
GERALD: One, two, three--
No! No! No!
Jesus Christ!
All I want to do is get you
in a straight bloody line!
What do I have to do?
HORSE: It's the Arsenal
off-side trap, isn't it?
-The what?
-The Arsenal off-side trap.
Lomper here is Tony Adams,
right?
Any bugger
looks like scoring...
we all step forward
in a line...
and wave our arms around
like a fairy.
DAVE: Well, that's easy.
OK.
Nathan.
GERALD:
And one, two, three, four, go!
ALL: yes!
GERALD: Perfect.
Perfect.
DAVE:
Well, you should have said.
GERALD: Come on. Get in quick
and wipe your boots.
Hey, put that back.
you'll break it.
DAVE: Just looking.
Bit posh, isn't it?
GAZ: Right, then.
-Are we right?
-Right for what?
GAZ: Taking us kit off.
DAVE: Thought you were
turning me into a fancy dancer.
GAZ: Listen, ladies,
we are strippers, aren't we?
GERALD:
What, here? Now? ln this house?
This is a good area, this is.
DAVE: Gaz, I dunno.
GAZ: lf we can't get us kit off
in front of ourselves...
what chance have we got
in front of all them lasses?
Tops off.
Come on.
DAVE: Well, no looking.
And no laughing, you bastards.
GERALD: I used to have
a proper job, me.
LOMPER:
I ask you, what are we doing?
GAZ: And the kegs.
GAZ:
Horse by name, horse by nature?
HORSE: Shut it, you.
-How come you're so brown?
-No reason.
GUY: Someone's got a sun-bed.
It's Linda's,
and, no, you bloody can't.
DAVE: What am I going to do
about this?
GAZ: It's not too bad.
From the front, like.
GERALD:
Fat, David, is a feminist issue.
What's that supposed to mean
when it's at home?
I don't bloody know, do l?
But it is.
DAVE: I try dieting.
I do try.
Seems I spent most
of me fucking life on a diet.
The less I eat,
the fatter I get.
LOMPER:
So stuff yourself and get thin.
GUY: Shut up, saggy tits.
This mate of Linda's had this
plastic stuff put on her...
at this posh health club.
She lost pounds.
It were like magic.
What's it called, now?
Anyway, it's like cling-film.
-I've heard of that.
-Cling-film?
I'm not a chicken drumstick,
Gerald.
GAZ: you wrap it around.
Reduce the fat.
GERALD: She swears by it.
GERALD:
you can't just take stuff.
MAN: Sorry, mate.
GERALD: I only owe him
a hundred and twenty quid.
MAN ON RIGHT: That's all
these'll fetch secondhand.
They're not secondhand.
MAN ON RIGHT:
They are now, mate.
DAVE: Put down and piss off.
MAN ON RIGHT: Fucking hell!
MAN:
I think there's been a mistake.
We'll check with the office.
Cheers, lads.
DAVE: It's not bad,
this stripping lark, is it?
GERALD: Dave and Lomps,
up the wing.
One, two, three, four.
Left touchline, three, four.
Right touchline, three, four.
Off-side trap, one, two...
three, four.
Now the belt, three, four.
Now the shoes, three, four.
Now the socks, three, four.
-Hang on!
-Carry on!
Aah!
NATHAN: That were crap.
GERALD: Give us a chance.
Even Madonna has difficulty
getting her shoes and socks off.
-you could have had me eye out.
-I'm sorry.
LOMPER: What are you doing?
They're bloody borrowed.
GAZ:
We can use them for the show.
It's what them Chippendales do.
They put Velcro down the side,
and then...all is revealed.
I'll sew 'em back up after.
LOMPER: Where did you learn
to be an ace sewer then?
NATHAN: Prison.
GAZ: Cheers, Nathe.
GAZ: Come on, Al. It's me.
ALAN: Which is precisely why
it's a hundred quid up front--
half price.
If I give you the club
for nowt, you don't turn up...
go back on your word...
I'm left with an empty club
on a Friday night.
GAZ: Course we'll turn up.
I haven't got one hundred quid!
ALAN: lf you told me what
you were up to, it might help.
GAZ: I can't. It's top secret.
ALAN: Sorry, youth.
-All right, luv?
-Hi, Mum.
MANDY: What do you want?
GAZ: All right, Mand?
I'm gonna get you
all your money.
Our money. Nathan's.
Well, you know,
for definite this time.
-yeah, right. That all?
-yeah.
GAZ:
Well, no. The thing is, Mand...

to accumulate in business, like.

NATHAN: I can.
I just need your signature.
It says in't book.
I'd like to take my money out,
please.
GAZ: you bloody can't have it.
All right, luv. It's sorted.
NATHAN:
It's my money. I want it.
One hundred pounds, please.
GAZ: When you're eighteen,
you can walk in...
and get it yourself, can't you?
NATHAN:
you said you'd get it back.
GAZ: I know, but you don't want
to listen to what I say.
you said so.
I believe you.
you do?
yeah.
Blimey, Nathe.

LOMPER:

GAZ: Christ all-bloody-mighty.
All right, sweethearts?
SHERYL: Gary the lad.
What you up to, shifty?
GAZ: Bit of this, bit of that,
bit of the other.
Just a bit of advertising
for some mates.
Oh, aye.
And who's gonna come and see
your mates?
We had the real thing up here
the other day, you know.
GAZ: Well, us mates are better.
Better? How's that, then?
GAZ: Well...

-Stark naked?
-Don't they, lads?
SHERYL: The full monty? you lot?
Ha ha ha! Hellfire!
That would be worth a look.
See you there, then.
GAZ: Keep your hair on.
DAVE: No way, no, and never,
in that order, kid.
HORSE: Excuse me?
No one said anything to me
about the full monty.
But you heard 'em.
We got to give 'em something
your average stripper don't.
yeah, but me willy?
I mean to say--
LOMPER: your willy? My willy.
GERALD:
A laughingstock. Totally.
Well, they're coming,
aren't they?
LOMPER: With a pair of scissors.
They know it's us, you know.
GAZ: And by closing time,
every bugger in Sheffield...
is going to know it's us
whether we do it or don't.
We can either forget it,
go back to fucking Jobclub...
or do it
and just maybe get rich.
And I tell you...
folks don't laugh so loud...
when you've a grand
in your back pocket.
Now, are you in...
or are you out?
RADIO: Heavy rain is causing
all sorts of problems...
for drivers on the Pennines...
where the A57's
closed at Castletown.
So please avoid the area
if possible.
The good news
is that the outlook...
for the rest of the week
is much better...
with the storms
clearing by Friday...
to leave the weekend
warm and sunny.
Now back to the music.
Here's another disco classic
from the seventies.
It's Donna Summer
with "Hot Stuff."
DONNA SUMMER SINGING:
Sittin' here
Eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about
a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone
off the wall
Lookin' for some hot stuff,
baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff,
baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff,
baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
GERALD: No.
GUY: Gerald. Come on, mate.
Just an hour.
HORSE:
There's some fit birds in there.
LOMPER: Nah, tits are too big.
HORSE:
yeah? Didn't know they could be.
"Anti-wrinkle cream."
Can fellas use this and all?
GERALD: Do you mind, you?
DAVE: I just pray they're
a bit more understanding...
about us, that's all.
HORSE: you what?
DAVE: They're going to be
looking at us like that.
What if, next Friday...
four hundred women
turn round and say...
"He's too fat, he's too old...
"and he's a pigeon-chested
little tosser."
HORSE: They wouldn't say that.
DAVE: He's just said her tits
are too big.
That's different. We're blokes.
DAVE: yeah, and?
GERALD: I think
she's got nice tits, actually.
LOMPER: I never said owt
about her personality.
She's probably quite nice
if you get to know her.
No, and they won't say nowt
about your personality, neither.
Which is good, 'cause
you're basically a bastard.
Bollocks to your personality.
This is what
they're looking at, right?
And I tell you summat, mate...
anti-wrinkle cream
there may be...
but anti-fat-bastard cream
there is none.
GUY: Uh, lads...
DAVE: Oh, mother.
Bloody hell.
GUY: Gaz said he wanted
something flashy, you know?
Hey, it's top of the range.
Real leather-like.
DAVE: yeah, but...
you don't get much
for your money, do you?
-What day is it again?
-Monday.
-And when are we on?
-Friday.
Dress rehearsal tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
HORSE:
How can I read the instructions?
There wasn't any.
No. Well,
maybe there's a part missing.
yeah, got that.
If that's what you call it.
Well, if it's all there,
how come it's not working?
What do you mean, in what sense?
It's not working in the sense
that it's not working.
No, I can't speak up.
Nothing's happening,
you know what I'm saying?
Nothing's getting bigger.
Well, this is an emergency,
is this.
JEAN:
What's the matter, big man?
DAVE: I'm sorry.
Dave.
Dave.
DONNA SUMMER SINGING:
Love with a warm-blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

NATHAN: you're ahead.
Oh, give us a break, will you?
GAZ: All right, kid.
Tell us straight.
We're not making the biggest
arses of ourselves...
in known universe, are we?
GERALD:
Dave, mate, can I have a word?
In private, like?
DAVE: yeah, suppose so.
GERALD:
you won't tell anyone, will you?
DAVE:
No. your secret's safe with me.
GERALD:
When I were about twelve...
our school
took us for swimming lessons.
Mixed classes.
you know--boys...
and, uh...

Oh. It were terrible, Dave.
I were there...
standing at the side of pool
in me trunks...
with all these pretty lasses
around in bikinis.
And, well, l...
I got, uh...
Well, l...
I got a stiffy.
What did you do?
GERALD: I jumped into deep end.
I nearly fucking drowned.
But what if it happens again?
Think of that, eh?
In front of four hundred women.
Gerald...
you're talking to the wrong man.
GERALD: I thought you said
it were just your mum.
HORSE: It's family, isn't it?
What can you do?
GERALD:
Who the hellfire is that?
HORSE: Oh, no.
It's Beryl, my niece.
NATHAN: Where's Dave?
GAZ: Here, Dave.
Dave! What are you doing?
DAVE: What does it look like?
GAZ: We're on in three days.
Where the fuck are you?
DAVE: I'm here--
working, earning--that's where.
Not pissing about.
End of chat.
GAZ: Dave.
-Come on, Dave.
-No.
GAZ: All right, then.
Ooh! Very nice.
DAVE: Gaz, please, don't.
GAZ: Come on,
Mr. Security Guard, do your job.
Gazza.
GERALD: Horse, mate,
get out there and tell them...
there's a bit of a delay.
HORSE: They won't wait forever.
GUY: Ohh.
GAZ: Keep up, you fat bastard.
Aah!
Don't ever call me
a fat bastard, all right?!
All right?!
GAZ: We need you, Dave.
I can't.
I just can't, all right?
HORSE: Listen...
just think of the most boring
thing you can come up with.
That should keep it
well in order.
-Like what?
-Double glazing salesmen?
HORSE:
Gardening. The Queen's speech.
GUY: Dire Straits' double album.
Nature programs.
GERALD: I like nature programs.
GUY: Aye, but they don't
give you a hard-on, do they?
Do they? Blimey, Gerald.
GERALD: Shut up!

But six months?
Six bloody months!

JEAN: I should've guessed...
when you started wearing
tottie lotion.

DAVE: Jean?
JEAN: But this...
Never had you down
for this sort of caper.
Explains a few things, at least.
No. Look,
I know it don't look good, but--
you're bloody right it don't.
All those nights
you were late back...
and stupid cow here...
thought you were out
looking for a job.
Well, no wonder.
No bloody wonder.
It's so obvious.
No. I were with Gaz. Honest.
JEAN: Oh, right!
She's one of Gaz's little tarts,
is she?
Well, that makes sense.
She'd have to be to put up
with this kind of shit.
DAVE: Hey, hey!
Just listen, will ya?!
It's nowt to do with
any fucking women, all right?
I'm...
I were a stripper, right?
Me and Gaz and some fellas...

out of taking us clothes off.
Strippers?
All right, all right. I know.

We weren't that bad.
Only I couldn't, could l?

Me, Dave.

No. Nobody told me.
GAZ: Ohh.
Our blokes from pub

The bastards.
GERALD: Ah, you'll be all right,
mate, once you're onstage.
GAZ: Once I'm onstage?
What do you mean,
once I'm onstage?
I'm going nowhere near
the fucking stage.
It's suicide,
that's what it is. Suicide.
GAZ: Shit.
I'll give their money back.
Alan, announce it, please.
To four hundred horny punters?
Ask me another one, kid.
ALAN: Hey, by heck...
our old English teacher's

GAZ:
We're gonna get torn to pieces.
They will

Have you ever seen...
a zebra brought down

Marvelous,

Aren't they marvelous?
GERALD:
