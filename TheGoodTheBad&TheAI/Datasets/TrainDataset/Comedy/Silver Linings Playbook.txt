PAT: What, are you kidding me? Sundays?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.
The whole families together. Mom makes
braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.
We're all watching the game. Yeah,
it drives me crazy, and yes,
I was negative. You didn't even know
that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.
I just didn't appreciate it,
or you, before. ”
I lost all that. I blew it. But you
also blew it. We can get it back.
We're going to get it back.
It's all going to be better now.
I'm better now and I hope you are,
too. And I'm going to appreciate--”
DANNY: Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about my hair too much.
And it was just the way I wanted it,
but he cut it back too far.
He cut this side back too far trying to
even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.
PAT: Once you get in the right frame
of mind, I think anything's possible.
I think we get, we so often get caught
in this state of negativity and
DR. TIMBERS:... technically, you can take
him out against our recommendation,
but you assume a lot of liability
in the eyes of the court.
And he's just getting used
to the routine here.
DOLORES: I don't want him to get
used to the routine here.
PAT: Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a
ride to North Philly?
PAT: Mom, no, it'll be fine.
It'll be fine.
Hello, Mrs. S. An honour to finally meet
you. Pat told me all about you,
how God made you rich in character,
and you're the mighty oak that holds
the household together, and not to mention
the lasagne you make on game day
PAT: Danny was in for assault because
of crystal meth and alcohol.
Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
That was when I was an X-ray
technician with my ADD and my
anxiety. I had a lot of access to
medication and I took advantage of it.
That's when my hair was long, too.
But my hair only grew when I was
older. When I was younger, my
Remember I told you about my brother,
he had a Jeri curl, and
I couldn't get a Jeri curl because
my hair didn't grow long enough.
But Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Hello?
Yeah! It looks great now.
You like it?
No, It's good now.
Yes, it is.
What? Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.
Mom, just listen--
Don't touch-...
... - the steering...
... wheel!
I am out on a limb for you
with the courts right now.
It's my fault. Pat didn't know.
Pat didn't know. He's my friend,
so he was rooting' for me. I'm having'
a disagreement with the hospital,
but we're working it out.
Take me back to the hospital,
but take Pat home, he's fine.
Trust me. You'll see,
Mom, can we stop at the library? I want to read
Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.
DeSean Jackson.
What happened to DeSean Jackson?
It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one
yard line. The one fucking-yard line.
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.#
I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!
You know something? It's nothing new.
Your team does that all the time.
They get close...... and then they blow it.
They got an inferiority complex.
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
What makes the Cowboys America's Team?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
We're in Philadelphia,
what's the matter with you?
You're a fucking traitor.
You know what's more American?
What?
Benjamin Franklin,
that's what's more American.
Benjamin Franklin. The founder of
our country, here in Philadelphia.
You mean the guy with the...
... little glasses and the long scraggly hair?
What about the lightning with the kite?
He stood in the storm with a kite.
If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
... would even know who he is.
What are you doing? No, no, no, no.
Don't touch them, don't touch them.
I didn't even touch ‘em. Why are you--,
don't blame me.
Who did this? Who took,
who took, who took the...
No, I don’t touch them. As a matter
of fact, I don’t know why you need so many.
What!!
What’s this?
Everything good?
Mm-hmm.
Where is it?
It's right here.
You got it. Ahh, well, we got that.
We don't want them to steal that.
You still got yours?
Yeah, I got mine.
So what, you don't talk to me? You
didn't tell me you took him out.
You didn't tell Dad
you were picking me up?
Don't worry about that.
I want to make sure when you come out
that you're okay, and
she didn't say anything.
You didn't tell me?
The court said yes. Don't worry.
Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because
the, the court listens to the doctor.
Yeah, and the court said-
The court listens to the doctor, the doctor-
Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay?
Let it go.
Dad, I'm in there because of the court.
That's the agreement that we made months ago.
The lawyer, he instructed me, he said
that what we should plead that, and
then I would serve eight
months and then I'd get out.
Thank you.
So what are you doing with yourself?
You know, I'm going to start a restaurant.
It's going to be a cheese steak place.
I'm going to pay for it,
don't worry about it.
Who told you that?
Mom told me. Outside.
You just told me outside, Mom,
what are you talking about?
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the
stairs, you said, “Don't say anything,
Why, Dolores? Why did you say that
to him? He has the wrong idea.
Everything's fine, Patrick.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
Okay, the question, the big question, is
what are you going to do with yourself?
What am I going to do? I'm getting in shape,
I'm getting trim,
I'm getting really fit for Nikki.
I'm going to read Nikki's teaching
Nikki sold the house. She left.
Didn't your mother tell you that?
Let me tell you something. You don't know
anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?
All right? Our marriage...
we're very, very much in love,
Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
not around anymore. Nikki left.
What are you doing, Dad?
You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
What does that mean?
It means you know what I'm going to do,
I'm going to take all this
negativity and use it as fuel and
I'm going to find a silver lining,
that's what I'm going to do.
And that's no bullshit.
That's no bullshit. That takes work
and that's the truth.
I just can't believe Nikki's
teaching that book to the kids.
I mean the whole time
-let me just break it down for you
- the whole time you're rooting for
this Hemingway guy to survive the war
and to be with the woman that
he loves, Catherine Barkley...
... and he does. He does.
He survives the war, after getting
blown up he survives it,
and he escapes to Switzerland with
Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant.
Isn't that wonderful?
She's pregnant. And they escape up
into the mountains and they're
going to be happy, and they're going to
be drinking wine and they dance --
they both like to dance with each other,
there's scenes of them
dancing, which was boring,
but I liked it, because they were happy.
You think he ends it there?
No! He writes another ending.
She dies, Dad!
I mean, the world's hard
enough as it is, guys.
It's fucking hard enough as it is.
Can't somebody say,
“Hey, let's be positive?
You know what I will do?
I will apologize on behalf of
Ernest Hemingway,
because that's who's to blame here.
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway
call us and apologize to us, too.
Why didn't you run with me?
Huh!!
Please. Do us a favour,
don't read for a while.
What are you wearing a garbage bag for?
I'm going to go run now.
Wait, wait, wait.
You have to fix this window.
I'll fix it when I get back.
Fix it now.
Get in the car, Pat.
You have to go to therapy.
You have to go. It's part of the deal.
You can't live with us and not go.
That song is killing me.
Could you please turn it off?
I don't have the controls.
I'm sorry, I-
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay... I'm sorry.
That was a messed up thing you did,
Doctor Patel. Alright!
That's a messed up thing.
I'm sorry, but that's... .
Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're
supposed to meet people, okay?
You should write that down
in your, I don't know
your little book you
write stuff down in.
I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted
to see if it was still a trigger for you.
Bravo. It's a trigger.
I'm not going to take any meds,
No, I'm not going to take any medicine.
It makes me foggy-
Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay?
My father is the explosion guy.
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat
up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.
I had one incident.
One incident can change a lifetime.
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take
responsibility for my side of the street.
She just needs to take
responsibility for hers.
What's hers? Are you joking?
Let's go back to the incident.
fight with Nancy, the high school
... principal.
I come home and what's playing
but the song from my wedding.
The song that you so charmingly
played out here today for us.
That's playing and I don't
think anything of it. Which is odd,
I come home, what do I see? I walk in
the door and I see underwear and
pieces of clothing and a guy's
pants with his belt in it,
... ll of a sudden I see the DVD player,
and on the D-...
... -VD player is the CD and
it's playing our wedding song,
... and I think,
“Oh, that's kind of sweet, she's in the shower.
What a perfect thing. I'm going to find
her and maybe I'll go in there.
We never-...
... fuck in the shower anymore.
... pull the curtain back and
there's the fucking history...
And you know what he says to me?
“You should probably go. ”
So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him
to death. But now I get fucking
chastised for it?
I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.
All right. Can you talk about something
that you did, before or after?
Yeah, about a week before the incident,
I called the cops and
I told them that my wife and the
history guy were plotting against
me by embezzling money from the local
high school, which
wasn't true...It was a delusion.
And we later found out from the hospital
Yeah. With mood swings and weird
thinking brought on by severe
And then the shower incident happened
and that's when everything
snapped, so I then realized that,
oh, wow, I've been dealing with
this my whole life. And without any
supervision I've been doing it all
on my own with no help and basically I've
been white-knuckling it this whole time.
Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when
you don't know what the hell is happening,
Why would you do that? You wouldn't
do that. Why would you call them?
I don't, I don't feel good when I'm
on them, Mom. I don't feel good.
I'm so much clearer without them.
Mom, they make me bloated.
Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality.
I've been working' out,
Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no score.
Come on, help turn the juju around.
Come on, Mister Excelsior. You want to
be positive? Be positive. Sit down.
For a second.
I'll watch the beginning of the game.
Handkerchief?
Yeah.
What OCD? I want my son to watch
the game with me, so sue me.
Just sit down, come on. I want you
to watch the game with me.
I'm not superstitious.
That's a small thing that I do.
If I make a lot of money, what's the
difference if I do this or that?
You see?! You see that?!
You're meant to be here!
This is special.
Everything happens for a reason.
Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes.
I got your whole sheet.
Mom.
Yeah. No, no...
Can I do. . an interview for a
school project on mental illness?
No.
It's for a school project!
Don't pay any attention.
Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
That's him.
People are stupid.
They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying.
Pat, don't look for Nikki!
Take your camera and get out of here!
Patrick, please.
Pat!
Patty!
Don't look for Nikki!
Nance! This is my lucky day!
Look at you working on a Sunday!
I just came by to say hi, to let you know
I'm ready to come back to work.
I'll sub, I'll work history,
whatever you want.
Here, let me give you a hand.
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
Let me ask you something.
Let me just ask you something.
You know I can't tell you that.
But Doug Culpepper is still here.
Why would you tell me that? You
know he broke up my marriage.
You know, you look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?
I'm better. I just want to let you know,
I'm better now. Okay?
I'm better. I feel good.
I feel so good. Look at my eyes.
I'm not a complainer anymore.
I'm a positive guy. Okay?
You know, a lot went down.
People will get over it.
I'm going to take that as
a silver development, Nancy!
A silver development!
That's a silver lining!
Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight.
I almost didn't recognize you.
I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital.
You know, work's out of
control, you know, she had the baby.
I'm really glad you're back.
I missed you. I really need someone to
talk to. You got to come see the baby.
She's beautiful. And Veronica
wants to make dinner for you.
Congratulations on the baby,
but I'm not buying the invitation.
'Cause you think Veronica
still hates you?
I know Veronica still hates me.
That's not true.
“Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where
she keeps his balls, in her purse. ”
Okay, it's a little true.
But if you think she still hates you,
you're wrong because why would she
tell me to invite you to dinner?
Now, you guys are still
in touch with Nikki, right?
As soon as you left, the Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging
it, loses the challenge, loses the game.
You're in this house, please
show some respect for what I do.
And we should spend time together anyway.
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.
I have very, good news,
everybody. Very good news.
You know what, I knew why they
invited me over. I knew it.
She--, no, she might be with him.
She's afraid of you.
No way, Dad.
You mean, Doug Culpepper?
You got to understand me. You want to
go back? Well then, stop this!
Yeah? Missus Solatano,
Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.
I work this beat.
Look, I heard about the restraining order.
And I heard you went to
your old house and the school.
It's not okay.
I've been assigned to your case, so you're
going to be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a
favour. Respect the restraining order, okay?
Five hundred feet. You hear what he just
said? You have a restraining order.
Tell me one thing. Would you like
to be a guy who goes back to jail
or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your
medication and if you do fine,
Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape
and get my life in order, and
then she's going to be with me. And
that's better than any medication.
Pat, there's a possibility,
and I want you to be prepared for it,
that she may not return. True love
is about letting her go and seeing
if she returns. In the meantime,
if you listen to that song, I don't
want you to fall apart.
So get a strategy, okay? You need one.
You have to do everything
you can, you have to work your
Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this
party on Sunday night and it's like
a real hoity-toity thing and his wife,
Veronica's a real stickler for... .
I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she
wants me to wear, but I want to wear a jersey
that my brother, Jake,
got me from the Eagles.
I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake,
I shouldn't have worn this.
Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.
Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honour.
You come however you want to come.
Oh, that's sweet.
That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.
Check this out.
We just redid the whole thing.
Yeah, man, I'm,
I'm thinking of redoing it again.
Because. Got to be making
a lot of paper to do that.
Yeah, we're doing all right, man.
I can't complain.
It is down, but you know, she wants
more, so I'm giving her more, man.
Yeah, but you know what?
No disrespect, it's not personal,
You start snapping up commercial
real estate -- cheap -- flip it
over, you flip it over and
that's when you make the money.
I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.
Listen to me.
Everything. The family, the baby, the
job, the fucking dicks at work,
and it's like, you know, like I'm trying
to do this, you know, and,
It's all right. You just do your best,
you have no choice.
That's not true at all.
You just can't.
I hope you're okay with Veronica's
sister coming over.
You okay with that?
Who?
Tiffany.
Tiffany and... Tommy?
Tommy died?
Cops die.
Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat.
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
I just see that you made an effort
and I'm going to be better with my
wife, I'm working on that.
I want to acknowledge her beauty.
I never used to do that.
I do that now.
‘Cause we're going to be better than
ever... Nikki. Just practicing.
I've, I've been planning this forever.
I love our house.
I love our house.
I'm really excited about it.
Oh, it's a television.
It's a computer screen. Nope.
It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
It's a light. It's a...
... it's a drawer at a morgue
where they pull out dead
bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
Where would the body go, though?
We have a port in every room.
Gimme an iPod.
Well, I don't have an iPod.
I don't even have a phone.
They won't let me make any calls.
They think I'm going to call Nikki.
Don't worry about it.
Don't focus on that.
I'm actually going to give you one
of my iPods. I have an old one.
Give it to me.
Thank you, baby, thank you.
Of all the rooms there
are iPod ports in,
I'm happy you brought
us into the bathroom.
Pat was a history sub at the
high school, Tiffany.
Here's a fun fact.
You know where the term “OK” comes from?
Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
president of the United States of
... and he was part of a club, a men's
club, called Old Kinderhook.
And if you were cool,
you were in the club, they'd say,
“That guy's OK. ”
‘Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
You know, Tiffany's been doing this
dance thing for years and she's
real good at it. She's going to be competing
at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
Nikki loves dance.
I'm just bragging about you. Can't
I brag about my little sister?
Me? None.
I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,
but I don't take them anymore, no.
They make me foggy
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,
so I stopped.
You ever take Klonopin?
Right?
Jesus.
It's like, “What? What day is it?”
How about Trazodone?
Oh, it flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.
No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we
haven't even finished the salad
yet, or the duck.
I made the Fire and Ice cake.
I said I'm tired.
Are you going to walk me home or what?
You have poor social skills.
You have a problem.
I have a problem?
You say more inappropriate things than
Stop talking about me in third person.
You can take Tiffany home first.
You love it, Von, because then you
can be the good one. Just say it.
No... I don't. I don't.
I just wanted to have a nice,
I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
Oh, God.
Nothing's my problem! I'm fine.
I'm tired and I want to go.
Yes, I really want to go!
It's been great.
Sorry. I don't want to wake up the baby.
Bye.
Listen, I haven't dated since
before my marriage so I don't
You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.
We're not liars like they are.
I live in the addition around back,
which is completely
separate from my parents' house, so
there's no chance of them walking
in on us. I hate the fact that you
wore a football jersey to dinner
because I hate football, but you can fuck
me if you turn the lights off, okay?
Old enough to have a marriage end and
not wind up in a mental hospital.
Look, I had a really good time tonight and
I think you're really
Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,
is that make-up on your shirt?
I can't find my wedding video.
Mom, wake up.
It's after three o'clock!
What are you doing?
I looked in here, but this is all your
sewing shit up here, for your
sewing and everything.
Did you put it up here?
Would you put it in here? It makes
no sense for you to put it in here.
He's got all his Eagles videos and
not one video of my wedding!
It feels to me like you want to
hide my wedding video.
I looked over there!
I already looked all over there!
I'm not calming down!
I don't give a fuck who hears,
I'm not calming down!
Anybody can wake up!
I'm not ashamed of it!
I'm not ashamed of it!
Let the whole neighbourhood wake up!
I...... don't care!
It's my wedding!
It's my wedding video!
I can't watch my wedding video,
but I CAN hear the fucking song
What the fuck you doing?!
You...... hit your mother?!
People in the neighbourhood are scared.
I got to come in.
There are a lot of reports from your neighbours,
we got a lot of phone calls.
Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.
You have to talk to her.
It's a medication problem,
but he's fine now.
Oh yeah? He's fine now? You want to
send him back to Baltimore?
We know all about the explosion
at the psychiatrist's office.
What explosion? No. Cliff is lying,
that's not true.
He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me!
Help me!
I'm sorry. I could just write you a
letter and you could just
let me have five minutes, explaining
how much better I'm doing.
There's a court order against you --
five hundred feet. Listen to me!
... and I'll take that fucking camera
and I'm going to break it over
your fucking' head, then I'm going to come
back and interview you about
what it's like to get that fucking'
camera broken over your head!
Go back to sleep. The party's over.
Show's over.
... this is not a reflection of where I'm at.
You can't... please,
you can't tell her any of this
You can't tell Nikki about this.
Come on, don't write it up!
I don't want her to see this!
It's okay, everything is okay.
We're fine, thank you,
That sounds like bullshit.
Why'd you run by my house?
Did our little conversation
get you upset last night?
Hey, this is my route,
okay? Just back off.
This is my neighbourhood.
You just ran by my house.
Okay? I'm running here!
Me too!
Well then, why don't you run somewhere
else?
There's a fucking ton of roads to run in!
What are you trying to do?
What the fuck are you doing?
Your husband's dead!
I'm not the one that just got
out of that hospital in Baltimore.
I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.
There's always going to be a
part of me that's sloppy and dirty,
but I like that, with all the other
parts of myself. Can you say
the same about yourself, fucker?!
Can you forgive?
Are you any good at that?
Let me just set the record
straight about last night.
Hurting my mother was a
mistake and I hate myself for it,
slapping the shit out of me
last night, which I did not return
‘cause I could've killed him and I
didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
You don't think I could've beat
the shit out of him? I mean... .
He was scared for your
mother and you hurt him as well.
Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think
he probably just tried to do his best.
Pat, you have to have a strategy.
I told you earlier.
You need to recognize these feelings coming
to you, otherwise you will be sent
back to Baltimore. So when you get
these feelings, you need to get to
a quieter place, and be at peace
with yourself, however you can.
Yeah, Excelsior. Listen,
I have a letter I want you to give Nikki,
Why did you have this
overwhelming urgency to see your
Oh, I don't know, because I'm married
and I haven't seen my wife
Maybe you think that Nikki's not around
and Tiffany's an attractive
girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany,
you will spoil your
Not bad, Doctor Jones.
But I don't think I'm going to blow it
she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can
fuck me as long as we turn the lights out. "
Maybe she just needs a friend and
she thought if she offers you sex,
it will be easier for you to
become friends with her.
She said she's not a whore anymore,
but she likes that part of herself
along with all the other parts of
herself and can I say the same?
Is that... . ? You're asking me, you're
really asking me that question?
With all my crazy sad shit?
What, are you fucking nuts?
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
I'm just giving back your
words to you.
This "crazy sad shit, " as you call it, made you a
happier, calmer person with a
beautiful positive philosophy of
No, not the books.
You said Nikki's friends with
Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
you become friends with Tiffany,
Nikki will think that you're a kind,
generous, large-hearted
person, who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving. So if
I don't know how to act
with you when you do this shit.
Tea
Be right back.
I ordered Raisin Bran because
I didn't want there to be any
It's not a date. So how's your thing
going -- your dancing thing?
I wouldn't actually call the
restraining order "my thing, ”
but getting back with Nikki is,
and I've been doing pretty well.
Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.
I wish I could just
explain it all in a letter to Nikki because
it was minor and I could
just explain it and let her know
that I'm actually not out of
I can get a letter to Nikki.
I see her sometimes with my sister.
It would be so amazing if you could
get a letter to Nikki from me.
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law,
I'd have to be careful.
I'm already on thin ice with my family,
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.
Oh... my God.
Nikki hated when I talked like this.
Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe
we should change the subject.
No. But then people were getting
into fights in the parking lot at
work, and in the bathroom... and the
boss called me in to his office and
tried to pin it all on me. So I accused
him of harassment and then
they fired me,
sent me home and put me on some meds.
... it was my wedding song and when
I hear it, I go kind of crazy.
Yeah. So they put me on medication,
which I feel ashamed of.
What if you told Nikki when
Veronica was in the bathroom?
Oh, my God, I'm going to go home
and write the letter right now.
Wait a minute.
Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?
Goddamn it. I knew it.
It was a test. How did I do?
"Sort of like you"?
I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
Because, it's just not right,
lumping you and I together,
I mean, it's just wrong.
And Nikki wouldn't like that.
Forget the entire fucking idea.
‘Cause that must have been
fucking crazy because
I am so much crazier than you.
Hey, come on. Look,
I don't think you're crazy, all right?
You told your therapist that you
were in a superior mental illness
I didn't want Nikki to think that I
was associated with that kind of
sexual behaviour because I've never
done anything like that, okay?
You may not have
experienced the shit that I did.
You are afraid to be alive, you're
afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.
You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened
up to you and you judged me.
You are an asshole.
You are an asshole!
What are you doing?
Come on. What are you doing?
Are you being a punk on
Halloween with these kids?
You want to go back to Baltimore?
Is that what you want to do?
Honestly He didn't do anything,
it was all the kids.
Come on man what you going to do about that song?
You going to go your whole life scared of that song?
It's just a song.
Don't make it a monster.
Come on breath!
There's no song playing. There's no song.
That's it. There you go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no. No, this was just a joke.
This is a joke I started.
Well, I'm fucked up.
What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus
the whore thing for the most part.
You're a funny girl.
You want to get a drink sometime?
What'd I say? She doesn't,
she doesn't do that anymore.
All the time. I'll still give your
letter to Nikki, don't worry.
You do? Yeah, sure.
I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?
I'll bet I know what
happened if only one is missing.
Either Dolores or Pat needed an
envelope and one of ‘em took it.
Dolores, somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?
What FBI? Come on, let's take a
look. I'll show you what this is.
I'm going to just explain to you something.
I mean, you know what
No, it's not okay. It's not okay.
You got to ask.
Listen, a lot of envelopes go in
and out of my office every day
But the envelope was empty.
I'm sorry, you were sleeping.
I didn't want to wake you,
but I needed an envelope.
You didn't want to wake me?
He didn't want to wake me.
He doesn't have a problem complaining
about Ernest fucking Hemingway.
He doesn't have a problem asking
for his wedding video-
Be nice. It's game day! I'm making
crabby snacks and homemade.
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come
on, she's making crabby snacks and
You're just up, up, up.
I don't know what that is.
Are you taking the proper
dosage of your medication?
Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.
Okay. Taking a little bit
too many or something?
No, if I was taking that,
I'd be on the floor, Dad.
Just stay with us. Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.
Spend family time. Wait, you mean OCD,
superstitious time?
Come on, your dad needs a winner.
Help him out.
Put on the jersey and stay, please.
Please. It's important, please.
Guys, I'm beating the song!
I'm on the scoreboard!
Is that another creep?
What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
We go running. Have you guys not
seen us? I took her to the diner.
Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey.
Is Tiffany home? Go away.
I know her. I know her,
we've dated. We still date.
What are you doing here?
I've called her, I've texted her.
I still haven't heard back.
We used to work together-
I just wanted to give you
my card to give to her.
Another rude creep.
Listen to what he's saying.
Listen to what he's saying.
What's he saying?
Sometimes it's okay with girls like this,
they want to have fun and sometimes -
-it's not because they got a
broken wing, and they're hurt,
and they're an easy target. And in
this case, in this particular case,
And you got to make sure it gets mended.
And you're getting' in the
way of that right now, okay?
Because she's sensitive and she's
smart, she's artistic.
This is a great girl and you got to be
Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.
Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are
you doing? What happened?
How come you weren't outside?
What the hell's going on?
What do you mean, you can't do it?
You can't do what?
Tiffany, what are you talking about?
What do you mean you can't
give the letter to Nikki?
Because what am I getting in return?
What are you doing for me? You
said! You said if I wrote a letter,
you'd get it to Nikki. I know.
That was the set-up.
Because I do this time after time
after time, I do all this shit for
other people and then I wake up and,
and I'm empty, I have nothing!
What are you talking about? You
seem like you're a tough girl to
I always get myself in these fucking situations.
I give
everything to other people and nobody
ever, I never -- I don't get
I can't do it. Tiffany,
what do you want me to do?
It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a,
it's a dance thing.
It's a competition thing at
the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.
Tommy would never do it with me
and I missed it every single year.
Well, Tommy's dead,
so he's not going to fucking do it.
Would you please!
I don't have a filter when I talk.
Can we have one conversation
without you reminding me that my
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
But I can only do it if I have a partner...
and now I'm about to miss
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm not going to fucking' dance with you.
What, your schedule is so busy?
“Grapes of Wrath” and watching
All right, then I'm not giving
her your fucking letter.
Wait a second!
But you promised you would do this.
I took care of that jerk off
that was in front of your house.
Let me ask you something. Do you
call him when you're lonely?
That encourages him, Tiffany.
You shouldn't do it.
What are you talking about?
We're in love and we're married.
How are you in love? Tell me about that.
The big Nikki love.
We have a very unconventional chemistry,
it makes people feel
awkward, but not me. She's the most
beautiful woman I've ever been with.
Okay? Yeah, we want to change each other,
but that's normal, couples want to do that,
I want her to stop dressing like she dresses,
I want her to
stop acting so superior to me, okay?
And she wanted me to lose
weight and stop my mood swings,
both of which I've done.
I mean, people fight. Couples fight.
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a
couple weeks. That's normal.
She always wanted the best for me.
She wanted me to be passionate and
compassionate. And that's a good
thing. You know? I just, look,
I'm my best self today, and I think
she's her best self today, and our
love's going to be fucking amazing.
It's going to be amazing, and you're
going to be amazing, and she's going to
be amazing, and you're not going to
be that guy that's going to take
advantage of a situation without
offering to do something back.
Danny, you're out of the hospital?
And you're here on game day?
I'm out. It's official, man.
They didn't convert me to my
Mental Hygiene Law admission status within
two thirds of the maximum length
of my felony sentence, so I'm out.
They had to let me go.
Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,
let's come back and sit down the
What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad's got you sitting here?
Danny's from you. This is your house,
so it comes down to you.
Don't disappear doing God knows
what with that Tiffany Maxwell.
Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?
Oh, she's a mess. You got to be careful.
She goes to a lot of therapy.
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
What are you trying to say?
Why don't you stop judging people? You
judge everybody. You're the one
I'm just looking out for you, I'm just
looking out for you. She's unstable.
What's wrong with your marriage?
What's wrong with your marriage?
You should have seen when I was at his
house. It's like a circus over there.
Shh, shh. What are you talking about?
I'm not going to hide this.
You need to deal with it.
Stop breaking my balls.
Oh!!!! I got you an iPod.
Whoa! Is this for me?
Oh, buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you. Wow.
Thirty-two gigabytes. How many
songs is that? Seven thousand.
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers.
Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
Got some Clash.
Oh, “West Side Story. ” Yeah, “West
Side Story. ” It makes me peaceful.
“Maria, I just met a girl named Maria... ”
Right, right, right.
And then when I'm angry,
which is a lot these days, I go to the
garage... Metallica... Megadeth.
I start fucking smashing shit.
I start breaking shit,
and I hurt my hand. And -
Ronnie, that's fucked up.
Yeah, but it makes me feel better.
When I'm with Nikki,
I'm never going to do stuff like that...
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer
wall, to Jake on the stairs above.
A restraining order is nothing to fool
with, bro. Holy shit, look at you! You
are fit! You look absolutely amazing.
You feel good?
How you doing, Jake? Good. You look
like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come
see you down at the hospital.
You know how those places creep me
out, and the firm's been expanding.
I've been helping Pop with the restaurant
‘cause he needs to have
a legitimate business. He needs a tax
return. With all the money that
he's making with his bookmaking, they're
going to come after him. And
then it looks like I'm making, I'm
going to make partner at the firm.
Well, I don't even know what to say
to you anymore. You lost your wife,
I'm getting engaged, and I want to be
able to tell you about those kind
of things. You lost your house, I'm
getting a new house. You lost your
Maybe stop talking about all the
stuff that's good for you and bad
for him. Just, you know, leave it alone.
We're watching the game.
You know what, I'm just going to, I'm
just going to, I'm just going to stop
As my friend Danny would say I got
nothing but love for you, brother.
That's right. That's right.
That's nice. That's nice.
Well, thank God, finally.
DeSean Jackson. Yeah. Did it fit?
Veronica didn't like it.
Veronica hates the jersey.
Whatever you do, watch out for
that restraining order, okay?
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me,
maybe we know something that
you guys don't know, okay? Did you
ever think about that? Maybe we
We have a sixth sense. I mean,
everybody's got it. Everybody's
I guess his sixth sense forgot
to tell him the cops were coming.
Well, we got a call that they did convert
you to a Mental Hygiene Law
admission status by the deadline
of your sentence, so... .
Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
Well then, what's the problem? He's
not going' anywhere. Just let him
finish the game, that's all.
The handkerchief is working. We're
I don't know what the hell you're
talking about “the handkerchief”.
And I'm glad that the Seahawks are
losing and we're winning, but I
got to take Danny McDaniel’s back to
Baltimore, alright? He can contest
Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law.
You're not correct.
I used the insurance money to build
this. I designed it. All the floors
are hard oak.
It has good bounce for dancers. Wow.
I'm not that great of a dancer, but
who cares? It's therapy and it's
fun. And the walls are good
‘cause I can play music really loud
Upstairs. It's a garage,
I just renovated it. You know, I was
Ronnie and Veronica and
I are going to see her tonight.
Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.
I did this thing about
she wanted to go dancing, I can be
able to do that because of all the
training that-No, that's good,
that's really good.
Maybe you can teach us both,
you know what I mean?
And I also mentioned how generous
it is, what I'm doing for you.
All right, let's start simple. Start
at that corner, walk towards me.
I'm good with a hammer. You want me
to fix something? A deal is a deal.
I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that
maybe there's a better scenario.
And the only way to convey how much
you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk.
I'm not doing it.
Do it. No. That's stupid.
No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki,
come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
five days, and I loved him. But for
the last couple months, I just
wasn't into sex at all. It just
felt like we were so different and
I was depressed. Some of that is just
me, some of it was he wanted
me to have kids and I have a hard
enough time taking care of myself.
I don't think that makes me a criminal.
Anyway one night after
dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret
at King of Prussia Mall and
got some lingerie to get something
going. And on the way back, he
stopped on 76 to help a guy with
a flat tire and he got hit by a car
and killed. And the Victoria's Secret
box was still in the front
He wants me to have-
all this Eagles information.
Football stays out of this place,
so does “Lord of the Flies. ”
Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you
doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.
I don't give a fuck.
What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey!
What? You're not going to read that
shit on my time. I can tell you all
about the “Lord of the Flies. ” It's
a bunch of boys on an island and
they have a conch -- they have a shell
-- and whoever has the conch
has the power and they can talk.
And if you don't have the conch,
then you don't have the power. And
then there's a little chubby boy,
and they call him Piggy and they're
really mean, and then there's a
murder. I mean, humanity is just
nasty and there's no silver lining.
Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.
Who's that? What the... . ?
What are you doing here, man?
If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,
I went by your parents'
house looking for you and they told me
Hello. Pat told me about you. So
is the girl, that you wrote about?
Yeah. What? He wrote about me?
I'm “the girl”?
He wrote about you, all right.
What'd he say?
He said you guys was helping each other
out and you were nice and had
No, please, tell me more about
what he said in the letter.
Yeah, anything you want to know,
I'll just tell you. It was nothing.
Cool. She's fine.
She is my friend with an “F. ”
A capital “F. ”
For “friend. ”
No, please. I think Pat,
you should be facing Tiffany.
Let me show you, Pat, let me show you
what I mean. You got to come at
Just, just sort of come in,
Pat, come in like this. And... .
Okay. Yeah. Can you move ‘em
a little bit more? Yeah, that's it.
You could turn around, too,
there's nothing wrong with that.
Come on, Pat, come on.
A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
I got to get out of here.
I got to go see this girl, Tanya.
Okay, man, hey. I'm going to be there,
man. I want you guys to win!
Excelsior! That's my man.
Let’s go!
We got a serious situation on our hands,
you know that.
We got to beat the Giants if we want to
have a chance of getting into
the division, any chance of playing in
the playoffs. Do you realize that?
I didn't realize that.
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.
I mean, I think it would be wise if
we spent father-son time, reading
about the Eagles, talking about them,
just to strengthen the good
I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend
enough time with you growing
up. I spent too much time with your
brother. It might have made you
feel worse about your behaviour, but
I didn't know anything, I didn't
is about. It's about us, spending time
now. I want to do everything I
can to help you get back on your feet.
That's the whole point. Yeah.
I wish you'd watch these games with
me so we could talk, we could get into things.
He's betting everything on the Giant game.
Everything.
All the money that he needs for the restaurant,
he's betting on the Giant game.
Tell him why. Because he believes in you.
Is that true?
I believe in you, Patty. I believe
in you. I want you to know that.
Even with all his friends? With all his friends.
He trusts you.
No. I'd love to go to the game, too,
but as you know, I'm banned
from the stadium. ‘Cause I'd love to
see us beat the Giants and take
Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet.
As a matter of fact,
I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough
for the restaurant on a game.
Randy.  I just hope you heard what I said.
It's like a
family business, it's our family endeavour.
We all stick together on this.
I made a commitment to Tiffany about
a project, and we have a very
important part of it that we have to
go over on Sunday, and
it's good for me, Dad.
It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's,
it's--, I never would've thought this,
but it's a good thing.
It's a dance thing, okay? There's
nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.
Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you
and half the day at the Eagles game?
Why? These are the two days that you
have promised me and that we have
prepared to nail the big move.
It's not ready yet.
I know, but my dad opened up to me
and it was really beautiful and I
want to be of service to him, okay? And
he's worried that the juju from
the Eagles is being fucked up and
he's concerned that it's because
No, you're not messing up the juju,
but the juju is messed up because
Nikki replied to your letter.
But you can't read it until after
Tiff, I'm sorry.
I can't do anything else without reading
Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--,
it's in the back of my head.
I'm just going to read it out loud, okay?
Because if she says anything
It was very emotional
for me to get your letter, as I'm
sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
you took the risk of discreetly
This gives us a chance to communicate while
I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.
I must admit you sound terrific
and I'm happy that you are
feeling so positive and becoming a more
loving and caring man, which I
belief in happy endings. I am also
moved by your act of love to read
the books I have taught at the high
school. I'm sorry you find them so
negative, but I disagree. I think
they are great works of art that
reflect how hard life can be and
they can also help kids prepare
themselves for the hardness of life.
In spite of all these
positive developments, Pat,
I have to say if it's me reading the
signs, I need to see something to prove
you are ready to resume our
marriage. Otherwise I find myself
thinking that we might both be
better off moving on with our lives
separately.
Pat. This dance can be that something.
You would have never
done something like this in a million years.
It shows all kinds
of skills on so many different levels:
focus, collaboration,
discipline. It's romantic,
like I said it would be. It's for her.
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Can I use your phone?
Is it an emergency?
Yeah, kind of.
What kind of emergency?
Well, I'm just doing this project
with Tiffany and I wanted to tell
Just don't make her an emergency,
that crazy girl, you know?
She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow
Jake's phone. It's too bad you
can't come in to the stadium, but I know
you were kicked out, you know,
for beating everybody up. Guess we're
not that different, huh, Dad?
Don't drink too much.
Don't hit anybody. You'll be fine.
So, Pat, what's this
I hear about you just getting' out?
What the fuck?!
I talked to you about that already!
You know, we must beat the Giants,
my brother.
Pat, today I'm your brother
in green, not your therapist. I'm so
happy to see you.
How wonderful that you are here!
Hey, Jake this is Cliff.
This is my doctor, Cliff.
Look, two things.
We got to watch that bubble screen for fucking'
Manning in the backfield
and we got to make sure we knock the
Okay, you know what? I don't have
her phone number. If you want, if
you really want, you can call
Veronica ‘cause she does, but I
Because she brings me down, man!
She just brings me down.
You have to change. You're not going to
throw the marriage away.
There's some kind of love there.
I know, I used to see it.
You guys have a beautiful thing that
got broken somewhere along the
Enough with awkwardness! I don't want to
walk in your house and not be
Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go! What
the fuck? What's that smell?
Nasty Indian curry! This is America,
baby! Go back to your country!
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Stay back, Pat. Stay back.
Leave the fucking Indians alone.
Stay here, stay here!
I'm not going to go anywhere.
Don't get in a fight!
What'd you do?
What happened? Dad-
The birds lose, I lose a fucking' fortune,
a fortune to Randy!
What the fuck did you do?!
You fucking lost it!
I thought you said you had it together!
You were solid!
You fell apart!
What are you fucking talking about?!
It's all fucking ruined now.
It's all ruined.
No, Dad!
It's all fucking ruined now!
It's all fucking ruined!
No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing!
Come on, Dad!
You fucking loser!
You ruined everything!
You fucking idiot!
You spike the ball on the one yard line,
We need to talk right now!
When you make a serious commitment to
Wait a second, I tried to call,
my God, what's happening,
I called--, but I tried to call you,
Tiffany, I-
I told you I was going to split my time
with my dad and you, and my
dad was pulling me in one direction.
Doctor Patel, Ronnie-
Well, that sounds great, Pat.
That's great for all of them, but
all of them didn't make a commitment
to me in return for my help.
There's no craziness.
I told you who she was,
I was doing this thing with her.
We had a conversation!
She's fucking nuts!
When you started spending time with her,
it all fell apart.
This is the fucking reason right here.
You think I fucked up the
Eagles' juju, don't you?
Ever since, ever since he was
with you, ever since-
The first night that Pat and I met at
my sister's, the Eagles beat the
Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six.
The second time we got
together we went for a run and the
Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to
The next time we went for a run the
Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-
The third time we got together we
had Raisin Bran in the diner and
the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay
in the fourth game of the World
Well, why don't you think about when
the Eagles beat the Seahawks,
He was with you? He was with me.
We went for a run.
There have been no games since Pat
and I have been rehearsing every
day and if Pat had been with me
like he was supposed to, he
wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he
wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.
Does anybody here happen to know
what the official motto of the
state of New York is on the official
seal of the State of New York?
“Excelsior. ” Look it up.
Yeah, “Excelsior. ” Oh Pat.
Not that I give a fuck about
football or about your
superstitions, but if it's me
reading the signs, I don't send the
Eagles guy whose personal motto
is “Excelsior, ” to a fucking Giants
game, especially when he's
already in a legal situation.
Unbelievable. Wow.
How did you know all that stuff?
I did my research.
Well, I got to say, I'm impressed.
I got to rethink this whole thing.
I didn't trust it before,
Oh, now you like her,
Dad? I have to say I do. Yup.
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?
You made the bet, I won a lot
of money, and now look,
your whole family is in turmoil.
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You
live for this shit. You've been
You're twisting the knife right now.
You get off on it!
That's bullshit! That's not true!
Don't say that!
You get off on it! If not,
then prove it. Prove it.
How do you want me to prove it?
How's he going to prove it?
By giving them the chance to win back
everything, double or nothing.
Double or nothing on the Bengals, next
week? Is that what you're saying?
That's your team isn't it,
Randy? That's his team!
I know who his team is.
When is the game?
December twenty-eight,
last game of the season.
Oh God. Randy,
I thought they were America's Team.
Yeah, I believe in America's Team
but if I win that bet, I win your
book, you're out of action,
you get no restaurant, no nothing.
I have faith, I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house-
Dad- --not in the State of New York.
In this house.
Dad, listen to me.
I didn't know that “Excelsior” was the state
I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.
Dad, Dad, Dad, this is
toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,
you shouldn't be doing-
Be quiet, shut up. You already did
enough. Randy, what do you say?
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team
favoured by one and a half points.
Patrizio, stop it! And Randy,
don't you take the bet!
How could you not take that bet?
Even with the ten points I give
you, that's an insane spread to
your advantage. Cowboys are
cowards. And I'll bet you're such a
coward, you won't take the ten.
Plus, are you listening, plus
whatever their score is at the
dance thing. What's that? Tiffany,
what's that?
What? No, no, no, no.
You're crazy to give away that many
points. That's ridiculous!
I won't take that!
However, wait a second.
I do like the idea of a parlay.
What? No parlay!
No! No, don't do it. Don't do it.
I don't know, I don't know how they
fucking score! We're participating.
We're not, we're not a part of it.
There are people, this is a high-
end dance contest. I don't know. Do
not put it as part of the parlay,
Each dancer is scored on a scale of
one to ten, ten being the highest.
Okay, score is from one to ten, right?
And you guys are how good?
I'm okay, we're happy
just to be going there.
And how are the people
you're competing against?
They're good. Some of
them are professionals.
They're good?
Better than you? A lot better.
A lot better.
So if I was to say you only have to score five,
No, no, that would be amazing if
we got five. Let's not get away-
We can't get five! Give ‘em a five.
Give ‘em a five.
What are you talking about, Dad?
You haven't even seen us dance!
Will somebody please
explain to me the parlay? Please?
You got to win two bets or you lose
the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to
win, the birds got to beat the Cowboys
plus Pat and Tiffany got to
That's very, very manic indeed.
That's the parlay. Shake on it.
You know what?
I'm not going to be a part of this.  Randy,
Randy, you're a sickness. You're a
fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.
Pat, calm down.
Thank about it. See you later.
Here we are again at the one yard line.
DeSean, snatching defeat from
What does that even mean, Dad? I'm
not going to make that, that, that
connection that you're making with
DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter
anymore okay? Just because
I have the fucking jersey on...
You are not a stand up guy right now.
If it's me reading the
If it's you reading the signs? You're
reading the signs? Oh, okay.
Yeah, but he's got to do this thing.
He can't be a quitter.
You took that stupid parlay thing, and
now he won't do the dance and
it was very constructive for him,
and you ruined it.
It's a white lie, what's that matter?
That's no big deal.
You know, we got to leave a trail of
bread crumbs so that
Well, you know, I didn't approve
when you called her and you told
her where he was running, so she could
ambush him. I didn't approve
of that, but you did it anyway, so
I'm doing this anyway. That's it.
Nikki's going to be there. You know?
Everything's going to come together.
We have a dance to do. We have
a parlay. You got to stay focused.
Dallas just tied with another
field goal, three-three.
Don't worry about the bet.
I'm worried about the bet.
Well, you knew that.
Maybe you should've scouted ‘em.
Patty, Patty, all we have to
do is we have to make a five.
That's all. You stay here and
watch the game with me.
The birds are better when Pat is with me.
We settled that.
Relax, we're going to do fine, okay?
I'll see you in a little bit.
Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy,
I'll see you. Alright.
Oh, I thought you were doing it.
We're doing a dance thing anyway
I want you to remember everything.
I want you to remember all of the
Of course I do. Just check in.
I got to go find Veronica.
Tiffany, please.
She'll see how well he's doing,
Pat told me.
He told me you should never throw a marriage
He said it several times,
Tiffany, and this is his chance.
Bartender! Bartender,
can I get a vodka, please?
So what do you do?
I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.
And the scores for Santos and Aguilar are:
seven point six, seven point three, seven point four, and
six point nine for an average
score of seven point three.
Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats
Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.
You got to find her.
I know, Mom, I know.
Hey, WHAT are you doing?
She's fine, buddy, she's with me.
Why don't you shut up, okay?
How many drinks have you had?
I've had two vodkas.
Listen, I don't know what choices
you've made, but you got to deal with
it right now, okay? We're in this.
You know, I used to think that you
were the best thing that ever
happened to me, but now I think that
you might maybe be the worst
And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak
are: six point seven, eight
point one, seven point five and six
point five for an average score of
They were great and they
only got a seven point two.
Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome
Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.
Alright, let's see the
scores for Solatano and Maxwell.
We have a four point nine,
four eight, a four nine...
That's really too bad, guys.
That's a lot of fours.
... and and a five point four for an
average score of. . five point zero.
The Eagles won, forty-four-six!
They won, forty- four-six!
How are you? You okay? Good. How are
you? I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.
You lost a lot of weight.
I've been reading your books and,
I have a positive attitude.
I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.
Where's Tiffany? She left.
What do you mean, she left?
Let me tell you,
I know you don't want to listen to your father,
I didn't listen to mine but
I'm telling you, you got to pay
attention to the signs. When life
reaches out with a moment like
this, it's a sin if you don't reach back.
I'm telling you, it's a sin
if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt
you for the rest of your days
like a curse. You're facing a big
challenge in your life right now,
at this very moment, right here.
That girl loves you, she really
loves you. And I don't know
if Nikki ever did, but she sure as
hell doesn't love you right now. I'm
telling you, don't fuck this up.
Wait a second!
I have one more letter for you to read, okay?
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Give it to her yourself!
Let me say something. You don't
ever have to see me again if you
This is so fucked up.
Yeah, just read it.
“... was by doing something crazy yourself.
Thank you.
I knew it the minute I met you.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to
You let me lie to you for a week?
I was trying to be romantic.
You love me?
Yeah, I do.
The world will break your heart ten
ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.
And I can't begin to explain that- -or
the craziness inside myself and
everybody else, but guess what? Sunday
is my favourite day again.
I think of everything everyone did for me
and I feel like --a very lucky guy.
We have to beat the Vikings by three.
I'm giving' you a six, which
is very generous after the beating
you just took. So what are we
I'd like to do another parlay if we make
it to the next round, that's all.
But we are going to make it to the
next round. We're going to beat...
No, that was me that did that.
No that was me.
That was me. I played the Jack. So
you put the bread crumbs, the
garlic in the steak and you
roll it up with the toothpicks?
Everything's good, everything's
good, yeah. I got you, you're all
down.  No, Randy, he's complaining.
You know he lost a lot
of money. He's moaning and groaning.
The restaurant's
happening because of Randy,
so everything's good.
