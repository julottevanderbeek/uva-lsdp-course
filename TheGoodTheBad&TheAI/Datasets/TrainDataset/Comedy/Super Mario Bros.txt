- You know, it just don't get
no better'n this.
- Yeah.
- Where's the rock?
- Koopa!
Miraculous World...
Miraculous World,
and yet somehow joined
and contiguous with our own.
It's not a big problem.
Just leave it to the professionals.
- Another dimension, you mean?
- Sure.
- Luigi!
We got a broken dishwasher
at the Riverfront Café.
You know what that means?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We got work!
The only thing miraculous I know
is that we're still eatin'...
- We ain't "goin"' broke, Mario.
We're already there.
- Yeah?
- Ow! Oh!
Yeah, but that's got the article about
the missing Brooklyn girls in it.
Oh, yeah? It's also got
one on the scientist...
- who turns brains into cheese.
- Yeah, well, you don't know.
It could happen.
How could that possibly happen?
I do believe. I believe
the rent is three months overdue.
That's what I believe.
- Fine, fine.
Left! I said left!
- What are you doin'?
- I don't know, Mario.
Just trust me, I got a good feeling
about this alleyway. I don't know.
- What?
- My instincts tell me
this would be faster...
Breathe in, big brother,
we'll get there.
Luigi!
You know, I read that sea turtles
navigate thousands of miles on instinct.
Not in New York traffic
they don't.
What're you complainin' about?
Come on, we're here, aren't we?
- You're getting worse.
gettin' worse?
How did we get into sea turtles?
- Faster. What'd I tell ya, huh?
- It's a miracle we made it alive.
I thought you didn't believe
in miracles, Mr. Tough Guy, huh?
Scapelli! They beat us to it again.
Another lost job!
has been ordered shut down
as university students...
Hey, Mr. Scapelli!
- Who's in charge of this hole?
- I'm the boss here.
- I'm Anthony Scapelli.
I'm the boss elsewhere.
My boys need to get back to work here.
How long are you gonna be diggin' up
these bones?
As long as our court order lasts,
Mr. Scapelli.
The university has explained to you
how important this site is.
But we'd be done here a lot sooner
if your goons would stop harassing us.
You look like a smart girl.
I bet you'll be done by tonight.
I know a lot of girls who've been
going missing in Brooklyn lately.
I'd be careful.
James, I'm gonna find a phone
and call the university.
All right.
Keep everyone digging
'til I get back.
They say it's dog.
Don't blow it this time.
- There she is.
-
Koopa's gonna kill us
if we blow it again. Let's get her!
Luigi, I told you to check the radiator.
Take it easy, will ya?
Relax, it's been makin' that sound
all week.
Oh, come on, Luigi,
you didn't tell me...
- Oh, man!
- Be careful, it's hot. Be careful. Whoo!
-
- Aah! Here we go.
- I'll do this.
- Go check the messages.
See if we got any work.
- All right. All right.
-
- Ow!
- I missed.
- Nice job!
- Where're you goin'?
To get some water.
Hello, this is Al Bronsky...
from Al Bronsky's
Department Stores.
- I have a big flood over here. So get
all your plumbers. Get extra plumbers.
- Thanks.
-
- Everybody's got tap water!
Three bucks!
- Any jobs?
- No.
Thank you.
Hi, it's Daisy.
Listen, we're gonna need
more security down here.
I don't care about the money. Scapelli's
down here making threats, and l...
She's beautiful, huh?
- Who?
- Her.
Her?
- She's nice. Go talk to her. Go on!
- No. I can't. I can't.
- Come on, go talk to her.
What's the matter with you?
- I don't know what to say.
Fine.
Bye.
- Here she comes. Here she comes.
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- For letting me use the phone.
- Oh, sure.
- And for the quarter.
- Are you okay?
I've got a few problems, but...
Well, you know, we got a van.
It's nice.
Yeah, well... No, no, I'm asking you
if you want a ride.
Oh, but, uh, it's broken.
- Well...
I overheard your name was Daisy.
You know, I haven't heard
that name around here.
and everything, but...
Not that I hang around the flower shops
or nothin' like that.
What my brother is trying to say
is he doesn't know what to say.
Doesn't even know
how to begin, but...
step into the van.
Okay. Thanks.
- I thought it was broken.
Oh, here.
This is as far as we can go.
- I'll have to walk the rest of the way.
- Wait. W-W-Wait.
- Ma'am.
- Oh! Why, thank you, sir.
- Well, thank you for the ride.
- It's a pleasure to meet me.
I mean, it's a pleasure
to meet you.
- Dinner.
- Do you eat?
Yeah.
- Dinner?
- Sure.
- Tonight.
- Tonight?
Oh. Okay.
- At 6:00, all right?
- Be here.
Great.
Bye.
What would you do without
your big brother, huh?
Like to give it a shot
and find out.
- Ah, come on!
- I'm just about to ask her that.
You'll impress her
with your manners.
Yeah, but why did you tell her
that I suck my thumb, huh?
What we're discussing is bones.
- Not exactly.
- Hey!
- Iridium.
- Oh.
Well, that's, that's unbelievable.
well, we think it could be what
destroyed all the dinosaurs.
Wow, there were
dinosaurs in Brooklyn?
-
Why don't you come on down
to the tanning salon...
and I can hook you up
with some free tans.
- And you want to take off that rock.
- Well, actually, you know...
I, I never take it off.
Well, I know it sounds weird,
but, I mean...
it's the only thing I have
from when I was found.
- Found?
- Oh, I was abandoned.
- Ohh!
You mean, you don't know who
your mother and your father are neither?
No.
What do you mean "neither"?
'Cause Mario here brought me up.
- Hey!
My father, my father! He's been my
father, my uncle, my brother, everybody.
Well, what are you two kids
gonna do tonight?
Well, we could take
the van back ourselves.
Um, if you're not doing
anything later tonight...
I would like to walk you home.
Okay.
- Spike! Spike!
- Iggy.
- Where're you going?
That's not the girl.
- I'm goin' to get the girl.
Of course she's wearing a disguise.
She thinks she can fool us.
- I'm gonna go get her.
Wait a minute. We'll follow her,
and then we'll both go get her.
- Good idea. I bag her, you grab her.
- No, I grab her, you bag her.
- That's what I said.
- Exactly.
- I did?
- You did.
-
- Outta my way!
You know, I just wanna say
one thing first.
I want to apologize right now, in case...
when I start to get talkin'...
and I start to say things
that sound really weird...
Uh, weird? Weird... Look, weird
is working in a bone pit all day.
And then spending your nights reading
about things that have been dead
for 65 million years.
- I mean, that is weird.
- Well, l... I find that fascinating.
And I mean... You know what,
if you just wanna end this right now...
- I would understand.
- You know, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.
Lf, if you wanna end this right now
and you feel bad about that...
but you wanna talk to somebody
about it, you could call me.
You really think what I do
is interesting?
I think it's incredible.
Well, you know...
if you want...
I could show you.
I'd love you to show me.
Show me.
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Good night, okay?
Drive carefully.
Mario!
I won.
That's what you think.
Oh, that was sneaky.
We don't even have
any security here.
That's what I was calling
about on the phone today.
You see, I can't get the university
to give me any extra money.
- Is that why you were
talking about Scapelli?
- Yeah, well...
Scapelli was down here with his crew
blasting at the site...
and that's when
they found the fossils.
- Are you sure you know
where you're goin'?
- It's just ahead.
Is this your office or somethin'?
Doesn't it give you the creeps?
Well, it's more like a home.
I feel comfortable down here.
Comfortable? Okay.
- Well, this is it. Have a look.
- Wow!
Awesome!
Oh, check this out!
and the opposable thumb.
It's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
- Oh, my... Hey! Hey!
- Hey, you guys!
Well, what did they, they do?
What've you got down there?
They're destroying everything.
Is it the sump pump?
Thank God you're here! I mean...
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you're a plumber, right?
Well, I don't know exactly what to do.
- Mario, Scapelli's floodin' the site!
- We need your help.
- Scapelli?
- Yeah.
Strap your belt on, kid.
We're goin' in.
Scapelli's been trying to force us out
ever since we got here. It's sabotage.
Down here! Hurry!
- This way!
- Allow me. I'm a professional.
- Looks like the bottom one, right?
- Yeah.
- One and 1/16, open-ended.
- One and 1/16, open-ended.
Wrong again. How many times
have we got this wrong?
- You've gotten it wrong five times.
- "O" for five, "O" for five.
- What percent is that?
- I don't know. Let me think.
I don't know,
but it's not good.
If we get it wrong one more time,
he's gonna kill us.
He's not gonna kill us.
He's not that nice.
- Up ahead. It's her.
I sense her.
I definitely know it's her.
Basin wrench.
- Basin wrench.
- Great.
- Here. Hand.
- Hand.
Now, does this guy know his stuff,
or does this guy know his stuff, huh?
- Okay, you ready?
- Say when.
- Let's go... now.
-
Aaah!
Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?
Come on, let's go this way.
- No, no. No, it's this way.
- Come on, let's go this way.
- That's the echo.
- How do you know?
- I've been listening to pipes
all my life. Come on.
- Okay, come on.
Daisy!
Luigi, this is a mistake. It's a dead end.
Come on, let's turn back.
- Okay, then you go back.
- Luigi, please.
- Give me the light.
Come on, give me the light.
Daisy?
Luigi, you see how deep that is?
Get back.
- Aaah! Lean back!
- The light!
- Oh, God!
- Ahhh!
Hold on to me.
- Daisy?
Daisy?
-  Watch it.
You see that?
Help me!
Daisy! Is that you?
Luigi!
- No!
- Luigi!
- Daisy?
No!
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, did you?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
That's solid rock!
- I got a feelin'.
- No, Luigi, forget it.
- I gotta go with it.
- Forget it, it's rock.
Look down there. Luigi!
Luigi!
- Mario!
- I disintegrated. Am I still here?
There she is, come on!
Come on, let's go, run!
- Back to where you belong.
- I'm gonna kill 'em!
No, you're not gonna kill 'em.
Not if I get there first.
I'm gonna break every bone in their body,
and then I'm gonna kill 'em.
I'm really gonna kill 'em.
- Daisy, I'm coming!
- Excuse me.
- You better not hurt her!
- Help!
Grade-A Express
to Koopa Canyon!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Get out of my way!
I don't know, I ain't been
to Manhattan in a couple of weeks.
Must've been
a bad couple of weeks.
- Daisy!
- Luigi?
- Daisy!
- Luigi!
- Mario!
- You better not hurt her!
Somebody, do something!
- Hey!
- No stalling up traffic. Move along!
- Somebody stop her! Daisy!
- Are you a cop, or what?
- Come on, get off me, man!
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, yeah.
- You're the one without the patent.
- Yeah, well, you're the old one.
- Oh, my God! Look at that!
- Get outta here! Watch out!
-
- Excuse me.
- This stuff's sticky.
- Yuck!
- Get away from my baby!
Get away from my baby!
- What is this place? This is crazy!
- I don't know.
Maybe the Bronx of today.
- No wonder they tell you
never to come up here.
- I got a feelin' we're
not in Brooklyn no more.
- Where're you goin'? Hey!
- Mmmm.
This... pit hole...
germs everywhere, fungus.
Sixty-five million years...
we've been exiled here...
after the meteorite struck...
while mammals roam free
in the other dimension.
Well... not for long.
When you get your rock.
When I get the princess.
- Princess?
and the Princess Daisy.
I'll finally be able to merge our world
with theirs and get rid of the mammals!
Yes, it's everything you've hoped for,
everything you've worked for.
- Hello, morons.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I captured the princess.
She's being de-fungused.
- Ah! Ah!
- I recognized her.
He couldn't tell
one mammal from another.
Good. Now... where's the rock?
- Rock, sir?
- Rock, sir?
The meteorite piece that
she wears around her neck...
and I told you not to forget it!
- That rock.
- I told you not to forget it!
And I told you to remind him!
I'll not be able
to merge the dimensions.
Where is it?
-  The plumbers took it.
- Plumbers?
Plumber alert.
-
Hey, fried tweeter, only 20 Koopas.
You like little wigglers?
Hey, listen. If we're gonna eat
in this place, we're gonna have
to be very, very hungry.
Excuse me, excuse me, Miss Lady,
can you tell me where I am?
Yeah, you're in my way,
egg suckers.
Who are these people?
- Are you boys new here in town?
- Lady, we're lookin' for somebody...
- and we're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah.
You know, boys, it's very dangerous
here in this neighborhood.
- You shouldn't wander
around without a weapon.
- Yeah.
- You got one?
- No.
All right.
Get 'em up, suckers!
-
- Koopa coins! I need Koopa coins!
- D-D-Don't touch that!
- Just fine!
- That's not even ours!
- Let me go!
What are you d... Put me down!
-
Bats!
Um, you wanna give us
the rock back, lady?
-
- Come and get it, big boy.
Hey! Hey, guys! Cheer up!
- Whoaah!
- You know the law, Toad.
Hey, wait a minute. You can't
arrest a guy for just singin' a song.
For anti-Koopa songs, we can.
- He is. I'm just apprenticing.
But I didn't do anything!
- Get in the car!
Are you tellin' us that you can
arrest a guy for bein' a plumber?
Get outta here!
- Get in there, plumber! Now!
- Hey, what is this?
- I'm gettin' arrested
for bein' a plumber!
- Write his number down!
-
- Stop pushing me!
- Daisy. Daisy! You too! Daisy!
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?
I don't really know.
There's this guy, his name is Koopa.
And he's lookin' for this princess.
I guess none of us here fit the bill.
You boys ain't
from around here, are ya?
- Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn.
Hey, what're you doin'?
- Name?
- Mario.
- Last name?
- Mario.
- Okay, what's your name?
- Luigi.
- Luigi Luigi?
- No, Luigi Mario.
Okay, look! How many Marios are there
between the two of you?
There's three.
There's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario.
Mike! Mike!
Help these Marios around the side.
Stop pushin' me around.
Prepare to be de-fungused.
I'm not goin' in there!
Aaah! Oooh!
- Hold still.
- Whooaa!
- It's cold!
-
What is this?
Brrr!
What was that?
The fungus unit.
The fungus is choking the city.
- Come on, move! Move!
- Okay, through the gate!
Through the gate!
Move it! Go! Go!
Let's go! Go! Come on!
Hey, Mario, look.
I grew an inch.
- Hey, what's that?
What's that red... Oh, my God!
Oh, no! Ohhh!
Oh, no!
-
-
Are we dead?
Say, what's another word
that rhymes with "dimension"?
- Yeah, "tension."
And I'm full of it, so shut up.
- Wait a minute!
What did you mean "another dimension"?
Did you mean like...
- our worlds have crossed over
or somethin' like that?
- Sure, kid.
You know, according to history,
a long time ago a big meteorite came...
- and blasted our universes
into parallel dimensions.
- Yeah.
You know what else I think?
All that fungus out there.
That's our old king. It's true.
But he's been de-evolved.
That's right. He's been
de-evolved into fungus, and now...
- he's wreaking his revenge on the city.
Yeah, that's us! You better get a lawyer
and get us outta this chicken coop.
- Yeah, me too!
- You got one.
- Let's go. Come on.
- Just let me do the talking.
Shut up!
Boys, boys... sit down.
How's prison?
You look like hell. I'm, uh...
Larry Lazard, of Lazard, Lazard...
Conda, Dactyl, and Cohen.
No, I'm from that,
uh, little part of all of us...
that can't stand to see
someone else in need or pain.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Wh-Who's this Koopa clown?
I don't think
you wanna do that.
- Why?
- Why not?
- That Koopa clown...
Is one evil,
egg-sucking son of a snake.
Now...
where is that
meteorite piece?
The what?
-
-
- You know what I'm talking about!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Ow!
- No one touches President Koopa.
You're Koopa?
Well, you just said you were one...
One evil, egg-sucking
son of a snake.
Did I lie?
Take these two
to the devo chamber.
- I'm all right.
- Come on.
Simon, de-evolve him now.
You tried to get rid of him,
but the king is everywhere.
- You can't get rid of him.
- See you later, alligator.
You may think of evolution
as an upward process.
Things evolve from primeval slime...
up to single-cell organisms...
up to... intelligent life.
-
can become... a loyal child
of the royal family.
Goombas, ah!
- Why'd you do that to him?
- Hey, no, no!
Not now, not now.
What single-cell organism
did you evolve from?
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lizard king,
thank you very much.
-
- Goomba.
Whereas my evolution was wonderful
and sweet, your de-evolution...
-
Yes. Loyal...
lethal...
and stupid.
-
Be proud. Go, Goomba!
-
-
-
- where you belong, lizard.
- Help me! Help me!
- Keep going. Got it?
- Got it.
-
- Yeah! Let's get outta here!
I'll kill that plumber!
We're back in
the police station!
Hey, Mario, look at this. These little
mushroom things on the fungus.
Hey, look at that.
What is that?
Well, look! It was trying
to give us that thing.
- Swing. Keep swinging.
- Okay.
- I'm swinging, I'm swinging.
- Just keep hanging. Close your eyes.
- Hey, hey, hey, look what he's doing!
- Yee-haw!
- Hang on.
Hey, man, this is fun!
Whoa!
- Get ready. Get ready.
- What was that?
- I'm ready, I'm ready!
- Whoo!
Ooh, yeh! Yeh, yeh!
Now!
All right, which door?
- Okay, my instinct tells me this one.
- Come on, come on.
- Let's go in this one.
- Oh!
- Come on!
- I'm coming.
- Let's get outta here!
- Here we... Okay.
- They got us! What're we gonna do?
- Number one.
- We steal this car.
Number two. I'm driving.
- All right.
- Help me, man!
- Come on!
Hey, wait for me!
Don't take off!
- Okay.
- Let's see what I got over here.
Now where's the starter
on this thing?
I got a feeling about this,
Mario-rooni.
I can't believe
you can do that.
Comes from sittin' on my butt all day
playing video games.
- Got it!
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's hit the bricks.
-
Hey!
- You look terrible!
- You don't look so good yourself.
- Aliens? We gotta deal with aliens too?
- Luigi, we're the aliens.
We are? Whoa, cool!
- Trust me.
- You're driving like a maniac!
Would you watch it?
- You wanna drive?
- I'm not riding with you anymore.
- Okay, you drive.
-
- How're you steering this?
- I'm not.
I hope the guy downstairs
knows where we're going.
Yeah, hey!
This is drivin'!
Cool, Mario.
Brace yourself! Now!
Glug, glug, glug, glug!
Which way?
- Take the parkway.
- Right.
Perfect. Perfect.
- You said the parkway.
- I know, but I wanted the tunnel...
so I said parkway 'cause I knew
you'd go the opposite way I suggested.
Hey, watch it!
What're you doing?
I can't stop this thing.
I can't see where I'm going!
Look out, Mario!
- Hit the brakes! Do something!
- This fungus is gonna kill us!
- We're gonna hit the end
of the tunnel! Look out!
Hey, was that superior
drivin' skills or what?
Let's get outta here before
this fungus stuff eats us alive!
Hey, the fungus just saved us.
What're you talkin' about?
It was my drivin' that saved us.
It wasn't your driving.
That tunnel just sneezed us out.
And then this giant booger caught us
in the air. That's what saved us.
Ah, come on!
Let's get outta here.
- Uh-huh! You there! Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry.
But the plumbers, they're in the tunnel.
They're on their way to the desert.
What are you doing here instead of
being in the desert heading them off?
That's exactly what I told him, sir.
Exactly what I told him.
Between you and me, Spike hasn't got
a thought in his brain, sir.
Huh, huh!
He's a liar, sir.
Between us, Iggy doesn't have
a brain in his head.
- I agree.
- They're  relatives.
- We'll wait outside.
- You blew it.
- You, Lena, bring me the princess.
And have her cleaned up.
Do you know
what I love about mud?
It's clean and it's dirty
at the same time.
-
The princess.
- Are you here to help us?
- Hardly.
Now let me guess
which one of you...
is Daisy.
Princess Daisy.
- Princess?
- What?
- Princess Daisy?
- This is gettin' weird.
Ah...
you have your mother's eyes.
Come with me.
Good-bye, Spike.
I'm gonna miss ya.
Good choice, cousin. I always thought
he'd make a great Goomba.
Bye, Spike.
-
-
Ah, our not-so-benevolent
dictator, as it were.
- Ignatius, do you know what
the square root of 26,481 is?
- What are you talking about?
- One-hundred ninety-one.
- What?
What are you doing? Not me.
No, no, not me, cousin!
Not me! Spike!
Help me, Spike!
- Please, not me. Not me, cuz. No.
Oh, my.
How peculiar.
That's quite an agreeable
transmogrification.
- More like a... transfiguration.
- Ah! A super-metamorphosis.
- Huh?
- Both of you go to the desert!
- Excuse me, excuse me.
That hardly seems logical,
does it?
Perhaps we should stay
and formulate our own strategy.
Tete-a-tete, inner circle,
that sort of thing.
Here's what's logical to me.
If you do not return
with the plumbers and the rock...
I shall personally kill you.
- We're going.
- After you, Ignatius.
- It was your mother's.
- What do you know about my mother?
She was quite an inspiration...
to some.
When Koopa took over, she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side.
Then she died.
What about my father, is he alive?
It depends on what
you mean by living.
- What are you talking about?
- Listen to me.
I don't care
whose daughter you are.
Koopa thinks you're the only one
who can merge the dimensions.
I've waited too long
to let all this slip away.
- Well, you said the tunnel.
- I did not!
- I said parkway!
- But you meant the tunnel.
Go on, pick a direction.
- Any direction you like.
-
Hey, that looks good. Over there, huh?
That's it. Let's die there.
Are the Goombas training with
the hand-held de-evolution gun?
- As we speak, sir.
- Excellent.
- It's mice or something.
- Apes, sir. Monkeys.
Disgusting mammals.
Your princess is here.
Well, my, my. Looks like you got up on
the wrong side of the nest this morning.
- You're a...
-
- Dinosaur.
-
- Yoshi is a pet of the royal family.
don't move your hands around
like a small wounded animal.
You must be the Great Koopa.
That I am.
Ruler of all that you see.
A few...
miserable streets and...
endless desert.
Well...
thank you.
Where's my father?
Um! Ah.
He's around.
You are so fresh.
- And so clean.
-
Don't fight it.
You know you've always been
uncomfortable in the human world.
And you've at least suspected
that you were...
different.
I've suspected a lot of things.
But not that l...
That you descended
from the dinosaurs.
And you know what they say...
about little girls, don't you?
- No.
- Hmm?
They say they never forget...
the first time they're
kissed by a lizard.
Take her away.
Throwback.
Plumbers. Affirmative!
Come, come, come, quickly!
- Quickly, after them, cousin!
- I'm with you, cousin.
Go forward!
That way, cuz!
Go right! Go right!
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- In the name of King Koopa.
-  We arrest you!
- Surrender immediately!
- If you two don't start talkin'...
-
We gonna leave ya
to these guys... for lunch.
- Now, where's Daisy?
- No, no, no.
- Where's the rock, scalawag?
- Where's Daisy, butt breath?
Where's the rock,
overweening rogue?
- Not until you give us
Daisy, biscuit head!
- Where is the rock?
Shut up!
Now, what's with this rock?
The rock is a piece
of a special meteorite...
which was chipped off
upon impact 65 million years ago.
Once this rock is reinserted
into the meteorite...
our two dimensions will reunite
and we will become one.
And our cousin, Koopa, shall become
ruler of both our worlds.
-
- I don't get it.
- Why didn't he come through before
like you clowns?
- You fools!
It's been sealed off for years
until someone on your side
blasted it open again.
Scapelli.
What if we get you the rock?
Will you get us Daisy?
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yes...
I think that proposal would
mutually benefit both our parties.
- Okay, now, hand over the rock.
- Someone took it.
By the bar. That lady with
the red spikes who mugged us...
- Was she corpulent? Very corpulent?
- No, she's just really round.
Ah-ha! Big Bertha,
the bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar!
Hey. Don't do that.
You'll hurt yourself.
- Oh.
-
I guess we're both
prisoners here, huh?
- and drive into the city!
- Then what?
First we get the rock, then
we'll take ya to Daisy in the tower.
Get your wrench.
Oh, man,
I lost all my tools!
Ah! Come on, let's go.
Come on! What are you waitin' for?
It's clear.
- We did it! We did it!
- Yeah!
- I'm brilliant!
- For mammals, you guys
are quite acceptable.
- Isn't this a little bit feminine?
- It was my ex-wife's.
But you wear this stuff?
- Yes, on occasion we have a date.
- Who do ya date, a canary?
Here, bring the tags back.
Thank you.
- Look for the red spikes.
- Hi. You're looking for those plumbers?
Well, I think I spotted 'em.
- to the downfall of Koopa.
- The sooner, the better!
- There she is.
- Where?
Leave this to me.
No woman can resist
the charm of a Mario.
I'm your main man. Your "ram-a-dame,"
your can of"spaim."
Maybe she's a little shy.
Excuse me.
Will you hit me again?
I've never seen such fluidity.
The way your knuckles crunch...
as you smack them into my face.
Huh?
Dance with me.
I'll hit you all you like.
- All right.
- That's it, Mario. Go, Mario.
You did it!
What are we gonna do?
- Here it is. Buttonhook, scramble
and right fake, okay?
- Yeah.
- Get them.
-
Seven, 24, hut!
- Liberate! It's not too late!
- She's got the rock!
- We'll get it later!
- Mmm.
- How we gonna get outta here?
- Use the stompers.
- Here?
- Put in a cartridge.
Click your heels together.
These?
- Thanks.
- Look, look! Look, another one!
-
Stop fiddlin' with the fungus
and let's get outta here.
- There they are!
- Get 'em!
- Cops! Daisy!
- Goombas! The rock!
The tower!
- Okay!
- You wanna wait for a bus?
- How we gonna get in there?
I got two words for you:
"Im," "possible."
Nothing's impossible, Mario.
Improbable, unlikely,
but never impossible.
I hope you're right.
My, my.
You have let yourself
You see?
I'm not such a bad guy.
You always wanted
to be everywhere.
Well, now you are.
You can go ahead and choke this
little mushroom kingdom all you want.
'Cause I'm outta here!
I'm out into the  world.
I got a couple of plumbers bringin' me
the  of the meteorite.
Soon to be dead plumbers.
And by the way...
Slime bucket.
Whoa. Whoa!
Oh, my God.
- Python Pizza here. May I help you?
- King Koopa here.
- I'd like the Koopa Special.
- Pterodactyl tail on that?
-
-
Walk in.
These pipes haven't
been serviced for years.
Must've been a nonunion job.
Luigi, lock off all these valves.
- What?
Ow! Ow! Ouch!
Treat your tools like a friend:
Keep 'em by ya...
never let 'em down
and they're always at your side.
Hey, Mario, how come it is
that for every situation...
ya always got a saying
about tools, huh?
- I got 'em from Papa.
-  He got 'em from Grandpapa.
How can we do that?
We can't just take an elevator.
We gotta do something.
We tripped the alarm.
- What do you think I am, stupid?
- Yes. How we gonna get up, huh?
- Like Marios.
Ha-ha!
Ingeniously! Come on.
Glug, glug, glug, glug!
- Look out.
- You're ingenious, Mario, ingenious.
- Shut up.
Iggy and Spike have been preaching
your overthrow at the Boom Boom Bar.
Really? I am very disappointed
in you, cousins.
- Fascist!
- Oppressor of the proletariat!
- Guy in charge.
- Egg sucker.
- Kill them.
- We need to talk.
- I want you.
- This is hardly the time
and place for that, Lena.
I didn't mean that. What I mean is
I think we can do this together.
- I think I can help you.
- I have just found out...
that I have saboteurs
in the tower.
I still do not have the meteorite piece.
I'm about to lose everything.
We can talk about this later
if later even occurs!
- What you care about is her.
- What I care about...
is the future of our species!
Oh! Very well then.
If not with you,
then on my own.
-
-
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. What?
- Listen.
- What?
- Trust me.
- What are ya...
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
-
Eat it.
- For me?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Oh?
I don't eat anything
with a face.
-
- Any chance of a plate
of steamed vegetables?
- Oh, yeah!
- Out.
-
- Bye.
So maybe...
I like this room, don't you?
It used to be my office until I...
got promoted.
Lena, will you help me
get out of here?
Well, I think yes.
- I'd love to get you out of here!
-
- deserves what they've earned.
-
- And I've earned this.
- Ahh!
- Ahh!
- Ahh!
Ten-hut!
Forward, march!
Vegetables.
- Yes, it's us!
Your Most Royal Highness, please!
- Help!
- Help!
- We're on your side! Please, princess!
- Help!
-
- Where are you going?
- I have to help him.
Stand still.
- You stay, I'll go.
- Okay, I'll stay, you go.
- You stay, and I'll go.
- Okay, I'll go.
- Allow me.
- I hope he's all right.
Princess Daisy, we've always been
your "loyalest" supporters.
- We've been with your father
since his demise.
- My father?
- What do you know about my father?
- Come with us!
- You tell her.
- No, I think you should tell her.
All right, we'll both tell her.
Daisy, I think this may come
as something of a shock.
Daisy, may I present to you...
your father.
- The fungus.
- Koopa's first victim of...
de-evolution.
This is my father?
- Perhaps at this moment of delicacy...
- A delicate moment.
- A retreat is in order.
- An ordered retreat.
- Those that fight and run away...
- Live to fight...
another day.
'Cause everybody
loves to dance, that's why.
A dancin' lizard's like
dancin' crocodiles... Oh!
Oh. Oh, I hate heights.
How we gonna get across?
- I can make it. I got a good feelin'.
- You're not gonna jump?
Come on, somebody's gotta do it.
We don't got no other choice, right?
- Luigi, this is curtains for us.
This is not
- L-I gotta go for it!
- Luigi!
Just do it, come on.
Just have faith. Jump.
You're flyin'.
Come on, Mario, come on.
Just trust. Jump! Come on.
- Okay, okay, I ju... just... yeah, okay.
No, no, wait, Mario.
Don't jump, no! It's not...
- I'm not flyin'! It's just a... hook.
- Ahhh!
-
- Oops. Sorry.
- Luigi!
Ah! Luigi, I'm alive!
I'd high-five ya,
but then you'd be an only child.
Come on,
let's go get Daisy.
- Let's swing it over there. Yeah. Okay.
- Pull with me.
My father?
Can you even hear me?
Yoshi!
Oh, look what she did to you.
- Ah!
-
- Daisy?
Luigi? Mario?
It's Daisy!
Daisy, we're comin'!
Let's get ya outta this.
- Daisy, where are you?
- I'm in Devo Four.
Daisy.
- Oh, man, it's cold.
- It's workin'. It's freezin' up.
- Great.
- Boy.
- Hey, M-Mario, did you see that?
- What?
It's tryin' to communicate.
Luigi, it's a mushroom.
Come on.
- There she is.
In place ready to what? Now?
Who ordered their deployment?
You did, sir. Lena relayed the command.
We carried it out immediately.
Lena.
She has the rock.
Arrest her!
- Daisy!
- Luigi, oh!
Later, let's get outta here.
This place is crawling alive...
- with giant lizards, come on!
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Listen.
I know this is gonna sound
a little strange, but...
my father.
Come on. Dad!
- Oh, man.
He used to be the leader here
until Koopa turned him into...
all this... fungus.
- Oh, man.
- It's an honor to meet you, sir...
and a pleasure, and I just, just wanna
thank you for all your help.
But, Mario, don't you see, it's been
tryin' to help us all along.
Giving us the little things
when we were hanging.
Come on, he wants
to clobber Koopa too.
- Oh, how's Daniella? Is she all right?
- Daniella?
I promised to take her
to Wrestlemania.
You mean, you don't know?
What?
- Hi-de-ho, mammals!
-  Goomba!
-
I'll meet you in the playground
after school.
You murderer!
Now, your father's still...
hanging around, isn't he?
And ready the troops.
We're going down.
Hey, you. Open up!
- Hello, Lena!
- Ah!
- Greetings from Koopa!
- Ah!
Ah, the rock.
They are not gonna believe
this at work.
This is a violation
of our civil liberties.
- Hmpf!
-
-  Angelica, come here.
- What?
Okay, don't say anything, but
my boyfriend, Mario, is right up there.
- What?
- Shh!
Hi, Mario!
He-e-e-e-e-y, ya!
- You betcha.
- Yes! You did it!
- Honey, listen.
Get that mattress, the Goomba mattress.
Take it over there.
Come on, girls, get the Goomba mattress.
Pick it up, get that side.
Move it, move it! Hey! Hey!
- It's heavy.
- Hurry!
- Hey, you must be the girls,
the missing girls from Brooklyn!
Yeah, except for Angelica.
She's from Queens but she's all right.
I'm freezin' my butt off here. There's
cold air comin' from that air vent.
Yeah, we froze the pipes.
We're goin' for a little ride.
Hail Koopa.
Sir, I believe
you were looking for this.
Excellent. Release Lena.
Princess! Ready to help me
destroy humankind?
Muster the Goombas!
Where's my pizza?
- Goombas!
- Goombas!
Down! Duck! Now!
- Gotcha!
-
Devo guns ready?
Are you all right?
- Are  all right?
- Right.
-  Mario-roni!
- Daniella!
- Not now.
Looks like I win.
- will all be de-evolved into...
- What is it now?
Oof! Ahhhhh!
-
- Gimme that.
-
-
Work, work, work, work!
- Take my tools
and get outta those handcuffs.
- Here, hold this.
- What?
Trust the fungus.
Trust the fungus.
-
All right!
Yeah, heh-heh!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Ah!
Ah!
Yes!
You wanna rock,
I'll give ya a rock.
- Hey!
You lookin' for this?
- Give it to me.
-
Gimme that rock, you monkey.
That's mine!
- We've gotta stop her.
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Who are you?
Luigi Mario.
What, you got a problem with that?
- I don't got a problem.
- No.
Okay, come on, let's go.
My time is come!
The universe is mine!
Die, die, you mammal!
You give me that rock!
Ahhh!
My time has come!
And the rock will merge
our two dimensions. Lena, don't!
You're too late.
You see, I do have the power
to merge the worlds, Princess.
- It's not too late.
We've gotta stop her.
- All right.
- Where are we going?
- Back from where you came.
Come on, move it, this way!
Come and get it, lizard breath!
- It's a B-bomb!
- He's got a B-bomb!
- B-bomb?
All right. Come on.
Come and get it.
- Don't look down. Don't look down.
- Get outta my way!
- Go on. You've gotta get
through and tell everybody!
- Go!
- Oh!
- Good luck, Luigi!
It's incredible!
Uh.
Yikes.
Man, she sure makes
an impression.
That's what Koopa meant.
Only I can withstand the force.
- Come on.
- No!
l-It's jammed in.
I can't get it.
- Luigi, we've gotta stop it.
We've gotta get it out.
-
- Grab on to me!
-
Come and get it.
Oh. It's melting.
We're merging.
You don't have the rock!
You filthy mammal.
We're merging!
- I'm gonna drill it out!
-
- Gimme the wheel puller.
It looks like a corkscrew.
- This?
- Yeah.
-
Hold on to me, all right?
Look!
It's Koopa's tower!
Those guys'll do
anything for publicity.
Mario?
Gimme that devo gun.
- He's trying again?
- What is this?
Monkey!
Scapelli?
Boss! What'd they do to you?
And now,
I'm gonna make a monkey...
- Trust the fungus.
What? No!
B-bomb!
Take a gun. Go.
- What are you doin'?
- It's okay.
- He's a friend.
Shoot him! Shoot him!
- Stupid!
Ahhh! Plumbers!
You plumbers!
Duck!
Hey!
See ya later, alligator!
- Need a lift?
- What?
- Come on, get on my feet.
- Oh, right.
- Oh, Luigi, Mario.
-
-
Oh, I'm back.
Love those plumbers.
It's solid.
All right.
Come on, let's go.
I can't.
You mean, you wanna stay?
Until we can get things
settled here and...
I can get to know my father.
Come on, Daisy, you know
how I feel about you, right?
I wanna be with you.
I do too, but... I can't.
She's tryin' to tell ya she can't leave
here until she knows where she belongs.
Come on.
It's open.
Come on, Luigi, come on.
Bye.
Judge for yourself.
Alternate worlds...
Hey, I love that dress.
I never seen that before.
That's what you said
last time you saw it, Mr. Wonderful.
Luigi! Come 'n' eat.
It's beautiful.
Mario, we're on
Come on, hurry up!
- Oh!
and managed to return
the missing Brooklyn girls...
and save a parallel world
from a ruthless dictator.
- Monkey-fried to the max.
-
I'd call them
the  Mario brothers.
- Yes!
- He-e-e-e-e-y, glug, glug, glug!
- It's open.
- Luigi! Mario!
- Daisy!
You gotta come with me.
I need your help.
- Why? Wh-Wh-What's wrong?
- You're never gonna believe this.
- I believe it.
- You do?
I believe.
Well, I must say. We have
a very exciting proposal.
A video game
based on your many adventures.
What would you call it?
"Iggy's World."
"The Indomitable Spike."
"The Super Koopa Cousins."
