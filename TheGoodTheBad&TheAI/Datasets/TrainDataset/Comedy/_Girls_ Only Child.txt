HANNAH: Oh, my God,
he really knew so many people.
It's just crazy that you don't know the depth
of someone's power until their funeral.
It's so sad.
Oh, my God. I think I see Zadie Smith.
- That is definitely her.
- All right, calm down, kid. It's a funeral.
Who do you know here?
Uh...
That's David's assistant, Bob.
Please help yourself.
ANNALIESE: I can't believe it.
It's just so nice of you all to come here.
It really means everything to me.
- Hi, Bob.
- on.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Hi, Hannah. Thank you.
ANNALIESE: Bob.
Bob. Sweet, sweet Bob.
What would I do without you?
Hi, I'm Adam.
- Oh. Hi, Adam.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- This is Hannah.
- Hannah, hi.
- A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
I'm Annaliese.
You haven't met. This is David's wife.
Oh, you're... You're David's wife, yes.
- So, you two, um, lived together...
- Yes.
...romantically as well as maritally.
I'm sorry, I...
How did you know my husband?
- This one.
- Ah, yes, I was writing my memoir for him.
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, I know exactly who you are.
David spoke about you all the time.
- He did?
- He did.
Oh, gosh, he loved you.
He really loved you so much.
You know, he always would tell me
about this amazing girl that I needed to meet
who had overcome such obstacles.
And now, finally, I am meeting you.
Thank you.
Well, my OCD is very much in check now...
But the Tourette's and the obesity...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That was Paige.
- What?
- That wasn't Hannah. That was Paige.
- Not Hannah.
- Oh.
- Obesity?
- ANNALIESE:  No, no, no.
- I don't have Tourette's.
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't know about obesity...
- If everyone could take their seats.
I've always thought
I was more chubby than obese.
No, no, no, overcame. It's my... I'm so sorry.
- It's nice meeting you.
- No, please.
- It's very nice to... Bob, where are we headed?
- Thank you.
Where are we seated?
I thought you said he was gay.
Well, I don't know now.
He had gay apps on his iPhone
and he liked to show his ankles,
but what does that even mean
in this day and age?
Hello, everyone. I am Father Tudor Snowdon.
Today, we celebrate
the life of David Pressler-Goings.
Can we go now, please?
I'm not leaving until
I have locked eyes with Michiko Kakutani.
I told you that.
ADAM: I'm gonna wait outside.
HAN NAH: Okay.
Hi again.
Oh.
Hi.
- Hannah.
- Right.
- Not Paige, Hannah.
- I know.
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.
I was surprised
that David had such a beautiful...
Just stunningly...
You thought he was gay.
- Uh, no.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. It's okay, it's okay.
- I didn't. I thought he was straight.
- lt's okay.
I thought he was straight.
I thought he wanted to sleep with me.
- Really, I know you...
- I wouldn't have slept with him, but...
A lot of people think it.
A lot of people think he was gay.
Well, he acted gay.
- And, you know, he was sometimes.
- Okay.
I loved working with your husband.
- David was wonderful.
- Oh, I bet.
I mean, I know.
Um...
I'm working on a book with David, too.
I was. Was.
I really hope you finish the book,
and I really,
really hope I get to read it someday.
Thank you. Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, now that
Millstreet has dropped all of Davids projects,
I just...
I'd have to find a new publisher, so,
you know, we'll see...
Wait, you said
Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?
Yeah. Oh, shit. Shit.
There's David's morn. She's so devastated.
- Have you seen Pepper? Did you meet her?
- No, I didn't, no.
- She's devastated and I should...
- You were saying that...
You were saying that
Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects?
Right, that's right. For now, yeah.
So, my book is dead?
Um...
Do you happen to know another publisher
that I could maybe slip the manuscript to
if I do decide
that I really want to try to keep it alive?
Okay, um, if I do give you another name,
will you get the fuck out of here?
Yes.
Great. Great, I'll be back.
Honestly, I just...
I loved your husband.
JESSA: You know the person
who gave me this
told me that
it used to belong to Edna St. Vincent Millay.
But who can ever know if that's true?
Can you believe
that my friend told me that she died
so that she didn't have to hang outwith me?
Yeah, I know, I totally get that.
Excuse me?
Okay, look,
I know that we, like, technically live together,
but this is still very much my private home,
and it just is slightly worrisome to me
that all you do all day long
- is sit around and watch the Forensic Files.
-
And I have kept my mouth shut until now,
but I literally cannot
keep my mouth shut any longer
because I really need to study.
- Since when?
- Since forever!
Plus, my recent hijinks
have really taken a toll on my GPA.
But I thought this was your time to go wild
before you become
an international business lady.
Yeah, exactly,
so it's really important to my 15-year plan
that I get into a good business school
because I don't want to
become like all my friends and family,
yourself included, no offense.
What happens after the 15-year plan?
It would be, like, insane to think about that.
Oh, yes.
CAROLINE:...so difficult
to even nourish myself.
Yes, I could definitely come in tomorrow.
ADAM: ...conditioner later
and then it's deodorant.
CAROLINE: Why? Why?
Why are you inherently disinclined
to support me in any way?
ADAM: You're living in my house.
CAROLINE: Oh, God!
Thank you so much. I will see you then.
I really appreciate it.
ADAM: Why should I give you anything?
Oh, right, God forbid.
God forbid we assist one another, right?
- Simply because we share the same blood.
- HANNAH: Guys...
Forget about the fact
that I spent my formative years raising you
- because Verna had absolutely no interest.
- No, I never asked you for anything.
- No one ever asked you for anything.
- Oh, please.
You can't be bothered
to do anything for anybody.
ADAM: You need so much
from everyone all the time...
Oh, my God. Seriously.
Seriously, it's already been
a very long day for me,
and what I need is a peaceful house
where people are centered.
See what you're doing, Caroline?
You're upsetting Hannah
when she just found out her book is dead.
I actually just found out
I have a very exciting meeting
with a publisher
who I think is pretty interested.
I was just trying to make myself a meal.
- Just feeding myself...
- With my last eggs.
Guys, I cannot take this anymore, okay?
- We have to work this out.
- ADAM: There is no working this out.
Okay, I've watched enough
to know you can work anything out
if you talk about it.
CAROLINE: I would love to.
Thank you, Caroline. I appreciate that.
Adam? Will you join us at the listening table?
Please?
-
Come on.
Thank you.
Okay, I think we should all start
by acknowledging
that we all really care about each other.
So, Caroline, tell me you love me.
Hannah, I love you.
I love you, too.
Adam, you tell me you love me.
Why are we telling you we love you?
Okay, so then why don't you both
just tell each other that you love each other?
- Adam, I love you.
- This is dumb.
HANNAH: Okay,
emotions are running high right now,
and I think it's really important
that we avoid using inflammatory language.
Words like "dumb,"
words like "skank," "fatty."
Let's just acknowledge
that we're here for each other
and make this a safe space.
So, Adam, why don't you just begin
by telling Caroline
what some of your issues are with her
in a very calm, rational way?
I feel like she's an evil person
who pukes on everything, metaphorically.
Okay, maybe perhaps
you could elaborate on that...
- Jeez.
- ...and be a little bit more specific
with some of your issues with me.
Okay, specifically, you don't know
what you want to do with your life.
You have no drive, no real goals,
but somehow tons of opinions.
Interesting, interesting, interesting,
interesting, interesting.
Why is that interesting seven times?
I just have to say that sounds a lot like you.
Whose side are you on?
She's not on anyone's side. She's the Dr. Phil.
Well, it's easy to say when she's on your side.
- I'm not on anyone's side.
-
I'm not on anyone's side.
I'm on your side.
If I had to pick a side, it would be your side.
This is something I'm doing for us.
Why are you whispering? She can hear you.
I can hear you. I'm sitting right here.
What is that?
This is a space cigarette,
invented by Stephen Dorff.
It's just water vapor and nicotine
and good things like that, you know?
I'm really on a mission to improve myself.
Okay, if you're serious
about improving yourself,
you need to do more than just,
like, smoke Dorff cigarettes.
You need to grocery shop
and condition your hair,
even though
I know it does so well with natural oils.
JESSA: I'm gonna get that job.
Are you sure
that's the kind of job you should be having?
Like, being near things that children are near?
Yeah, I want something
with a touch of innocence.
SHOSHANNA: You have a criminal record!
ADAM: No, I'm not like you.
I'm not a different person every other week.
- Oh, really?
- You're hearing each other.
- Let's keep doing that.
Really? What is it?
Okay, it was an actor last week.
What was it before that, a woodworker, huh?
And the last time I saw you, you were, what?
You were gonna go join
the special armed forces, G.I. Joe?
- Those are professions.
- That's crazy.
I remain the same,
whereas you move to Montana,
put on a phony accent,
and claim to be a midwife or some shit.
It was a doula.
You know what, guys?
Let's just take a breath, okay?
Adam, we have given you a chance to express
what some of your issues with Caroline are.
So, why don't we now
take a moment to hear Caroline?
You are doing really good.
Thank you.
I feel good about it, but it's too soon to say.
Okay, first I want to say, Adam,
that I love you very much.
-
- However, it really upsets me
that he thinks of me as this insane,
dependent nightmare,
because he knows how hard
I have been trying to get my stuff together.
Things fell apart because of bad luck
and you're the victim again,
- but next year will be your year...
- Yes, yes, I am cursed with bad luck.
- I am sorry that that upsets you so much.
- Over and over.
Just get a normal job and an apartment
like everybody else and stop bloodsucking.
- He's been angry like this always at me.
- lt's okay.
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
I think it is possibly because
he is internally battling a sexual desire for me.
Holy dogshit!
HANNAH: That's a weird one.
That's a weird one for me.
I'm sorry, guys. It doesn't take a psychiatrist
to correlate Adam's romantic interest in you
with a repressed fantasy toward me.
- I don't want to fuck my sister.
- No one is saying you do.
Caroline just did.
That is true, and, Caroline,
that goes in the category of things
we should never say out loud ever,
no matter what.
This is what she does.
She finds a way to
drive a wedge between people
so everybody ends up
just as unhappy as she is.
I know, I know.
I don't want a wedge between us.
- She's sick in the brain.
- You're sick!
You're sick in the brain! You're sick...
-
- HANNAH: Stop it, you guys!
Please stop!
- Please! Hey! Hey!
- Ha-ha.
- Hey, T.O.! You're nuts!
-
I do not understand why
you can't be a little bit better to each other.
Being an only child is extremely lonely.
All I wanted as a kid was a sibling.
Caroline, come on, you don't think
your brother wants to have sex with you.
No, not in a physical way, no.
See, it was all
a big misunderstanding, all right?
So, can't you just tell your sister
you love her?
Yeah, I do. Whatever.
Great!
Okay, you just make me crazy.
I know I do.
I'm sorry.
Sorry I yelled at you.
Hold on one second, guys. I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna put this on silent...
Okay, I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Marn, I can't talk right now.
So, I went out this morning to get a muffin,
and I saw this teenager
giving away kittens from his backpack.
And so' I took the cutest one.
You have to come over and see it.
Uh, I'm sorry. I really... I can't.
You never can, Hannah. Why?
Well, I'm sorry.
We're having a very real moment over here.
Fine, don't come see
the cutest thing that's ever lived. Good-bye.
You're my best friend.
-
-
- Hannah.
- Hi.
I had Mo read a couple of chapters last night
and he loved them.
- Loved them.
- That's what I said.
So, I read a bit this morning
and I get you, Hannah Horvath.
- And I like you.
- MO: I knew she would.
Thank you so much.
You're like a Mindy Kaling meets...
- Joan Didion.
- No, Mo.
- I love Mindy Kaling. She's terrific.
- Right, but she holds back.
She'll go there,
but she doesn't go all the way there,
you know what I mean?
I definitely do. She just never...
She never takes it there.
You take it there
and then you take it even further,
and I'm just like,
"Whoa! How the fuck did we get here?"
Mindy Kaling's not writing about choking
on long balls, so...
Well, neither am I.
You wish, Mo.
Anyway, the book
obviously needs some work.
It's not as tight as it can be,
but I really think we can get it there.
So, who is Hannah Horvath?
I am... I write my own books and I'm not a...
Right, no, but beyond these pages.
I want to know more. Who are we selling?
How would you describe yourself?
What's your brand?
- Good question, Mo.
- Thank you.
Okay, let's see. My brand.
Well, I'm from the Midwest,
so, I will always be
depending how far I live from the coast.
The farther I am from the coast, the fatter I am.
So, I guess my brand is Tombstone pizza.
Uh...
Uh, let's see. I...
I feel like I'm a person who just, like,
can't keep my mouth shut.
There's things
that you only talk about with your friends.
Those things I'll talk about with anyone.
- I don't believe in secrets.
- Right, TMI all the time.
You're like Kathy Griffin on truth serum.
Well, I don't know.
Kathy Griffin's not exactly...
What the fuck is truth serum, Mo?
Well, I'm sold,
but here's the thing about our company.
We don't do e-books.
Well, maybe you should start.
Nope, so we'd
want to put it out as an actual book.
That you can hold, buy in a store,
that kind of thing.
I hope that's okay with you.
Are you kidding me?
I mean, that's the best thing I've ever heard.
I just said yes to an e-book
because it was better than, like, a "no book."
- That's exciting.
- Sorry.
You guys laugh too much. I don't even care.
I'm sorry. That's so good.
- Okay, Mo.
- l'm so... I'm sorry.
Hey, what's up?
Hey. What are you wearing?
- I'm heading to play ball.
- You play basketball?
Yeah, what do you think I do?
I don't know, read, eat soup,
write letters of complaint to local businesses?
- Won't you come in?
- Wow.
-
- Ray, this place is huge.
Yeah, well, it's not exactly Versailles,
but it works for me.
Yeah, it's not half as bad
as Hannah said it was.
No, it was.
Believe me, it was a real house of horrors.
Yeah.
I'm surprised you live in such a nice place.
No offense.
I could never live all the way out here, though.
Once you go to Manhattan,
it's hard to go back to Brooklyn.
Well' sounds like
you know what you're doing to me.
- Totally, thank you.
- Yeah.
Oh.
- So...
- Yeah?
I'm on pins and needles here, Mam.
What did you want to talk about?
Yeah, so I guess I just wanted you to...
God, I don't really know how to say this.
I wanted you to tell me what's wrong with me.
- What's wrong with you?
- Yes.
It just feels like it's time for me
to take responsibility
for what has happened in my life,
and you are someone who likes to tell people
what's wrong with them anyway,
so, shoot.
- I'm smelling a trap here.
- No, it is not a trap.
Seriously, this is what I need.
From you, specifically, please.
So, just give it to me.
- Please.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- All right.
- You ready for this?
- Yes, I am a strong woman.
All right, let's see here. Hmm.
Well, for beginners,
you're extremely judgmental.
What?
Yeah, you came in here and immediately
insulted me and my neighborhood.
Those were funny jokes.
- Were they? Were they funny jokes, Mam?
- Well...
You come across like
you're better than everyone
and you want no pan of their lives,
and then when you're excluded from things,
you're outrageously offended
and hold onto this grudge.
Also you're unbearably uptight.
Okay, who isn't uptight, really?
If we're being serious.
And you use people.
- No.
- You use people a lot.
- No.
- Yeah, you do.
So much so that even
when you try to connect and be sincere,
it comes across as phony.
I think that actually
more or less sums it up in a nutshell.
You're a huge, fat fucking phony.
Wow.
Okay, yeah, thanks.
I'm super glad I came here. That was great.
Yeah.
Fuck.
But, that being said, I still like you.
Why?
Because behind it all, I think you mean well.
And I'm old enough to recognize
that all of this bullshit
comes from a very deep, dank, dark,
toxic well of insecurity,
probably created by your absent father.
And that allows you to be
a sympathetic character.
That's nice.
Look...
You are, ultimately, a good person, Marnie.
Okay? I believe that.
Thank you.
You're welcome. You want a hug?
Come on. Give me a hug.
Maybe I went a little too far. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Take these off. Take these off.
Take them down.
Oh, fuck, how many pairs of underwear
do you wear?
- Hi, Dad.
What's going on?
Nothing, just taking the day off
to soak up some rays.
Well, also, I had a small procedure.
Nothing to worry about. Are you...
Okay, I just met with a publisher
and they want to give me a real book deal.
Not a stupid' pathetic, shitty e-book deal,
a real book deal.
Well, that is... That's great. love bug.
Are you okay? Why aren't you more excited?
Well, to be honest, you know,
I just got off the phone with Cousin Rudy,
and he looked at that contract
like you wanted him to,
and it seems that your old publishers
own the rights to your book
since they paid you.
No, they were very, very clear about the fact
that they're definitely
not publishing the book.
Well, Rudy called and spoke
with someone over at the Millstreet,
and apparently they don't release the rights
on any of the books
they acquire for, like, three years.
Dad, that's insane.
You're not making any sense, okay?
You're, like' loopy
from your procedure or whatever.
- Small mole on my...
- Plus, Rudy is not even a real lawyer, okay?
He's like a Subway sandwiches
franchise lawyer.
- He took the time to...
- Rudy represents sandwiches, not art, okay?
If a pepperoni sub
is ever suing a tuna salad sandwich,
let's call Cousin Rudy.
Well, I think you should call Cousin Rudy
and talk all this over with him.
And it sounds like, in three years,
you'll be able to do
whatever you want with that book.
Three years?
Three years might as well be a million years.
Well, we tried three years for you.
Well, you're insane and I have to go.
I should really get going.
I have this lunch thing.
Yeah, I should get going, too.
I run point... Point guard on the court,
so I don't want to keep the fellas waiting.
Mmm-mmm. You can't do that.
- No.
- No.
Should I wait for you?
No, you go ahead. No. I'll wait here.
You go, so...
Hey, um,
thanks for talking to me.
That was really helpful when you talked to me.
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
I'm glad it was helpful.
Nice to know I could be of service.
Okay, so...
Yeah, so, be safe and stay warm.
You know, maybe for the time being,
it might be best to keep this on the DL,
the down low, you know?
Go fuck yourself. Like I'd advertise this.
Okay.
"Miss Horvath,
pursuant to our agreement of July 18th, 2012,
"the exclusive
rights to your e-book are nontransferable
"and remain the property of Millstreet Press
"and all relevant subsidiary divisions
for three years,
"effective the date of signing."
I am so sorry. You poor thing.
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.
Listen. Listen to me.
You wrote all of those wonderful stories
and now you know you can do it.
You just have to write a whole new bunch
of wonderful stories, that's all.
Ugh!
"A whole new bunch of wonderful stories"?
My whole life was in that book.
Everything that's ever happened to me, okay?
The hand job kidney stone.
The time I fell asleep on a pile of pizza boxes.
When I made out with the Cuban refugee,
then the thing happened with the glitter pens.
All of it's in there!
And now, what am I gonna do?
Live another 25 years
just to create a body of work
that matches the one that they stole from me?
What if nothing happens in the next 25 years?
What if I'm still living in this apartment
wondering if there's asbestos?
What will I write about then?
Why are they doing this to me?
CAROLINE: I know how you feel.
I really do. Listen.
When I was in the eighth grade,
they came to shoot
in my hometown,
and I got an audition
for the part of Alicia Casse.
By all accounts, I was fabulous.
I mean, the part was tailor-made for me.
They gave it to somebody else,
but in that moment,
I was certain that my acting career
was finished, you know, forever.
Caroline, that has absolutely nothing
to do with what we're talking about,
and your acting career is over.
Where's Adam?
You know,
he should be here for you right now.
Mmm-mmm.
No, he shouldn't.
He has his own things going on.
No, don't you see, Hannah?
This is his modus operandi.
When times are sunny, oh, there's Adam.
But when the great seesaw of life
throws your cunt in a sandbox,
he's a ghost, nowhere to be found.
This is what he does.
- Hey, Caroline?
-  Yeah, honey?
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.
Can you try shutting the fuck up?
Listen, I feel your pain. I really do.
But, honey,
I think you're projecting a little bit.
You feel my pain?
How do you feel anyone's pain?
All you do is talk and talk and talk and talk.
And every time I come home to my apartment,
you’re just here talking.
And at first it was kind of fun,
but now I'm getting pretty fucking sick
of listening to your mouth run. Just...
I'll go to my room, give you a little space.
It's not your room, it's my room.
The whole apanment's mine,
and for the low, low price of $2,100 a month,
it could be yours, but it isn't.
Well, what would you
like for me to do, Hannah?
Hmm, let me think about it.
I'd really like you
to get the fuck out of my apartment!
Fucking selfish little whore.
You and my brother deserve one other,
you know that, you selfish little pricks?
And you will never write a thing that matters
because you will never
understand the true struggles of humanity,
because you just slipped
right out of your mothers pussy
like a nice little golden egg,
you spoiled little fucking brat.
MAN ON TV: I actually suffered
and still continue to suffer from acne.
Hey.
Hey.
What's up?
Where's Caroline?
I kicked her out.
What? Why?
'Cause she was ruining our lives and
I thought it would make you happy, finally.
Well, what happened?
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.
- Hannah?
- I don't know.
What did you do?
I'm supposed to be taking care of her.
Well, you didn't like doing that, so...
Yeah, so? She's my sister.
Do you understand that? What the fuck?
