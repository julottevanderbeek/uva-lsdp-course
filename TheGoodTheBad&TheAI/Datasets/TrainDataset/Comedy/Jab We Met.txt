Look, I don't think we should
jump to any conclusions!
We are meeting here because we are
considering Mrs. Khanna's demands.
Consider? Who gave you
the authority
Good morning, sir.

platform no.5 at 5:05.
Hey, hurry up.
Mister, hold this luggage!
- Let me get in!
Give it! Give it!
Give it to that gentlemen!
Ma'am, you quickly get in!
You don't worry about me!
Just load the luggage inside!
Quickly! Here!
Ma'am, I told you in the
beginning
have luggage enough
for two coolie's!
Hold the frame carefully!
Its Babajii's frame!
Is there more luggage?
Don't worry! No matter how much
more luggage there is. Let it come.
Here!
- Here! Here! Hold this!
This is really risky!
Ma'am, you please look ahead!
- Yes, I am!
You just quickly load the luggage!
Come on! Come on! - Give me
your hand! Give me your hand!
Come on!
Oh God!
This was the limit, I
crossed the line today!
Do you know what?
Till date I have not missed
a single train!
Thank you, Babajj! You saved
me from breaking my record!
I am inside now.
- Yes
I am not that beautiful!
I prefer travelling in
a Non-AC compartment.
But my  they
say 'you are a girl! '
As if I don't know that I am a girl!
Mister, is this A1?
- Yes!
Thank you!
Now what is the connection
between AC and a girl?
I don't understand that!
I am not travelling alone
for the first time!
That too in this train! This
is like my second home!
Please show me your ticket.
Hello! I am talking to you!
Hey! This is my seat. 23!
Strange. Hey, mister!
This seat is mine! 23!
Nobody likes to take
the passage seat
But I always insist
on the passage seat.
The reservation uncle gets
very alarmed and worried
But my logic is  my journey
doesn't end with this train!
I am going to Bhatinda.
My house is there.
My family is there.
Everybody has a family.
I have one too.
Everybody says that Mumbai
is a crowded city.
What do you mean by crowded?
People like us form the crowd!
They are a part of the crowd!
Still they crib!
I am leaving Mumbai! Forever!
Do you know when I came here?
When Mumbai was Bombay!
Hostel! Hostel! Hostel!
St Teresa's boarding school
hostel in Shimla!
Missionary hostel for college
girls in Bombay Central!
I swear! Henceforth I will never
live in a hostel again!
I hope the road digging
stops before the monsoon.
Otherwise do you know
what will happen?
Anyway! What happened?
What are you doing?!
It's really dangerous!
Are you dumb? You can't talk?
Or are you shy?
Or are you just insolent?
Something is surely the matter!
I have asked three
still no answer!
Ticket please!
It's on the berth! I will
just give it to you!
Excuse me, mister! Ticket please!
Hello, mister! First
come inside! Come on!
Show me your ticket!
He wants to see your ticket. Ticket!
Where is your ticket?
- I don't have a ticket.
Actually you see what
happened is
plan was made at
the very last minute.
So there was no time
to buy a ticket.
By the way the train
is quite
So you can give him a ticket now.
There is no problem, right?
Mister! Are you convinced
or shall I say more?
Ticket for where?
Hello!
Where is this train going?
- What?
Last stop. Delhi. Give
him a ticket to Delhi.
Look. I might as well tell you.
A tragedy has occurred with him.
He is going through bad times.
So that's why  Delhi!
Oh Mister! What's the matter?
Are you doing drugs?
Look, if there is any problem,
then you can tell me.
I don't mind! Tell me!
All my friends tell
me their problems!
And I solve it!
Do you know? I am that
kind of a girl!
Like an agony aunt whose articles
you find in the magazines?
I'm just like that!
Tell me! What's the matter?
Tell me what is your problem?
Tell me! Don't feel shy! What
is your problem? Tell me!
You are my problem!
You are talking non-stop!
Don't you understand that I am not
interested in talking to you?
I don't want to talk to you!
I don't want to know whether you
are going to Bhatinda or Benaras!
Whether you lived in some
hostel or some brothel!
I just don't care! All right!
So just please! Please! Leave
me alone! All right!
That thing about brothel
was not right!
Yeah!
I know! You are clearly very
upset about something!
That's why you got
upset with me too!
And you started talking nonsense!
But it's okay! I don't feel bad!
Actually nowadays I don't
feel bad about anything!
Do you know why?
Because I am going to
get married! Very soon!
Listen! I am eloping!
The guy is not Sikh so
my family won't agree!
But what can anybody do
after the marriage?
We will go and fall at their feet!
They will have to forgive us!
I like mountains a lot! Really!
Since childhood I had this
craze for marriage! By God!
What is the difference between
hill and mountain?
I could never understand.
I was just waiting for my
college to get
And his travel agency to open up!
But you don't find good
shoes there. That's
Hang on!
Hey! The train is leaving!

Such a fat woman!
Even a blind man could
see such a big basket!
And this crazy girl!
Now I don't know in which corners
my tomatoes are lying!
I will pick it up from here! You
pick it from there! - Okay!
You stupid weirdo!
Which world do you live in huh?
I have missed my train
because of you.
My entire luggage has gone!
I have lost everything!
And now I am stuck in these
clothes and
on this God forsaken platform
called Barnagar?
What will I do now?
Did I tell you to get
down from the train?
Can't you mind your own business?
Oh! So It's my mistake! Shameless!
I was helping you! You
should be thanking me!
And instead you are
showing me attitude!
Okay! Thank you! Thank
you for helping me!
Now will you please leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
I see! It's not so easy!
I have missed my train
because of you!
So now you will take me to Bhatinda!
To my house! Along will my
entire luggage! You see?
I am not going to spare you!
Don't have any doubt! I am

Why? Railway prices are cheaper!
Ma'am, this is the rate!
- Is that so?
Shall I ask the consumer
court what's the rate!
You are trying to fool me!
For 2 rupees you are
arguing so much!

A girl travelling alone is

Before somebody tries to

You will have to take some trouble.

Come! You can give me this
look while walking too!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Ratlam! Come on! It's the limit!
What does this mean? I am roaming
in the lanes of Ratlam!
From the train I would watch
these houses, these lanes!
Life is so strange! Right?
You are having a lot of fun, right?
As if we have come for a picnic.
You should be kept in a museum!
People should be charged
for seeing you!
What's the matter? And where
should you be kept?
You are in the train but you don't
know where the train is going!
You get down on some
unknown station!
Then you drive the car
like a crazy
...almost killing
you reach here.
And  you are walking
in the dark lanes!
Alone! In the lanes of Ratlam!
What is your problem? Tell me!
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
You don't share your problems
with anybody!
Right! Are you Bachchan's
fan? Angry young man!
Today you will be very happy!
Agnipath! Agnipath!
Tell me! Who is your favourite hero?
Tell me! This is not a secret!
Where have I come? What
am I doing? Why?
Come on! Please!
Do you accept credit card?
No credit! Only cash!
- Credit card!
What's the tariff?
- What?
How much do you charge for
a room for a single day?
Do you need the room per hour?
Just answer what I
am asking you! OK?
How much for a room for a day?
Why do you need it
for the whole day?
We don't have to stay
here the whole day!
Listen, let me talk! - Yes. You
are talking a lot of sense.
As it is we have less money!
We will take the room
on a per hour basis!
Geet! You are not understanding
what he
Be practical! Why do
you feel ashamed?
We need it just for a few hours!
We will take the room
on per hour basis!
How many hours?
2 hours will be enough?
Fine! To be on the
safe side 3 hours!
Ok.
Where did you find her?
- In the train!
In the train? You met
her in the train?
Nice idea!
Listen, how is the girl?
Hot! Beauty!

You are such a cartoon!
Do you know that?
Possible! But I know karate!
- So?
I am just informing you!

I see! I see! I see!
You know karate.
Meaning if I tried to rape
then you will use karate on me!
Right?
Possible! I mean yes! Absolutely!
I just look like  But
I have beaten many people!
Don't worry! I won't rape you!
You can't do it!
- I don't want to do it!
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't!
Are you trying to provoke
me to rape you?
No! I am just trying to clear it
So that you don't get
any wrong signal!
I hugged you at the station.
And I said let's go to some hotel.
I don't know what you
must be thinking.
That too a man like you!
A man like me? Meaning?
Girls must be hovering
around you in Mumbai!
Those kinds of girls!
But let me tell you that I
am not that kind of a girl
Don't even think of it!
My thinking is orthodox!
One man woman!
And I have a boyfriend! Anshuman!
One and only! Forever and ever!
You will be happy to know that
I too am a one woman man
All right?
Look at this!
Show! Show! Show! Wow! She
is really beautiful!
You are very lucky!
No! I am not lucky!
- What?
Oh! So this is the problem!
This girl has dumped you!
Life has dumped me!
- What do you mean?
O God! The famous silence!
What is this great secret of yours?
I have told you everything!
Why can't you tell me?
Anyway! Look! Look at this photo!
This girl has ditched you.
Right? Hold this!
Burn it!
Come on, Geet! You can't be serious!
I am damn serious! Burn
the photograph!
What childishness is this!
Listen to me! Do this childish
deed! Burn this!
You will feel really good! Burn her!
Here!
Burn it! Burn it! No tension!
Burn it!
Okay! Now go to the bathroom!
And flush her out of your
life forever! Go!
Do you feel better?
You know what?
Doing this foolish
I am actually feeling nice!
I am actually feeling better!
You were right!
See? And shall I tell you the truth?
You are not bad looking!
You are handsome
You seem to be rich too!
You will find much better
girls than her!
She was nothing compared to you!
Thank you. That's very kind.
I am telling you! Am I not a girl?
Any girl will be smitten by you!
You are of that type!
Look, I am getting married
to Anshuman and all that
But if he had not been in my
life then you never
Maybe I would have been smitten
too! Just imagine!
You like yourself a lot, don't you?
A lot! I am my favourite!
What happened?
I wish I too could
have been like you.
That is very difficult.
But you will find a better
that's for sure!
Why don't you only find
a good one for me?
Tell me something. Do you like me?
What?
- Look! Look at me!
What kind of question is this!
Geet, don't be stupid!
Tell me!
Quickly open the door! Run!
Wear your clothes! And quickly run!
Give me the full amount!
- Hello! What happened?
There is a raid! There is a raid!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Run!
Hey! What is going on?
We will have to run!
- Why?
Police!
- Police!
Come on!
Come on!
Quickly! Hurry up!
Everybody quickly run!
I will open the back door!
Listen!
What is going on? What happened?
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
What happened? Why are we
acting like smugglers?
Next time get some suitcase
to show to the police
That you belong to a good family
But I missed my luggage
in the train!
For the first time I am
seeing a train girl
Why don't you book a compartment
in the train?
Like those meant only
for two
I will tell you next time! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
What was he saying?
- Run! Run!
Please, Babajii! This is the limit!
Please don't give any more
excitement for this night!
Now please make this night boring!
The bus will leave in the
morning at 6 o'clock.
Are you feeling sleepy?
- No! What about you?
Why were you asking me
whether I like you or not.
Yes! Tell me! Do you like me?
- But why?
There is no answer for this why!
Do you like me? Nice, sweet, great?
Tell me quickly!
- Yes!
Yes?
- Yes!
If you like me, then you
will like my sister too.
Roop. My cousin. She
is just like me!
Listen to me. I am going
to elope every soon
With Anshuman! You
and Roop too elope!
Your problem too is the same.
Grandpa won't agree!
And then all four of us will live
together in the mountains.
We will have great fun!
What do you say?
Why don't we do this?
We both will elope.
We both will get married.
And live in the mountains.
Look, it's a convenient option.
If we don't go to Bhatinda now,
then we are eloping anyway.
if you marry Roop then
I will be your sister-in-law.
Half wife.
What will I do with just half?
I want you completely.
You will get complete Roop.
And me partly.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's
a bargain offer!
Yes. Half free with one!
Free! Free! Free!
That makes sense! But if I marry
you, the offer is still valid.
I am talking to you about
an alliance with my sister
And you are flirting with me!
Do you always talk nonsense?
Or today is a special occasion?
No! I always talk nonsense! You?
This is my first time! Actually
I have never met a girl like you.
Come to Bhatinda! I will
introduce you to one!
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.
Come. Let's get lost.
Let's get lost somewhere.
Let's walk for miles.
Where to go? It should be unknown.
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.
Sitting like this, how will
we discover a new path.
You too walk. And I too will walk.
Only then will these distances
bridge someday.
Sitting like this, we
discover a new path.
Come  both should have
no bond with anybody.
Let's walk for miles.
Where to go? It should be unknown.
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.
I don't like it without you.
I don't like it without you.
On opening the eyes, slumber says.
What fervour is this?
Here and there. God knows where.
This fervour is taking me.
Come. We will find
a way in this world.
Let's walk for miles.
Where to go? It should be unknown.
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.
You are
I have never heard anybody
sing so well!
You should have been a singer!
A person doesn't always
get what he wants.
Why? I think that whatever a person
really, actually
what he gets.
You know there was a time
when I really
There was no greater passion
in my life than music!
Your life is over now?
You are talking as though are dead!
Its not over
Now  can't happen anymore.
Why? Why can't you do it?
What is your helplessness?
Tell me!
O God! Don't tell me! Fine!
But don't become an angry
young man again. Please!
Okay.
I will start the conversation
- Of course!
The water is so nice right?
- Yes!
Have you ever jumped in
such a lake before?
Geet, I think we should be leaving!
We should try it! We
will have great fun!
Hang on! Hang on! I wanted
to ask you something.
Have you ever consulted
a physiatrist?
O shut up!
- No! You need one, Geet!
Shut up! And let's jump! - Okay!
Just relax! Just listen to me!
Just think! We might not get the
chance to do such a thing again!
I don't want to do such a thing
ever! Have you gone mad?
You have tried being childish
right? You had great fun
Now try madness!
- Geet, relax! Listen to me!
It was so much fun!
You need a physiatrist!
Don't look here!
Have you heard Dharamraj
Kashyap's name?
The industrialist? Of course!
He died last year! Why?
I am his son!
Kashyap!
Yes!
Now you know me.
You are the Kashyap!
It was your mother that ran
away with another man?
Shit. Sorry.
Yes! It was my  who
ran away with another man.
Actually I heard it in the
news in this
So it came out that way. I am
really sorry. Really, really!
No, Geet! I will have to hear it!
Why you are you saying sorry?
If somebody's mother
can be so
she can do such a
derogatory deed
Mr. Kashyap! You shouldn't talk
so disrespectfully about her
Why? That woman destroyed
my entire family
Because of her I will feel
front of everybody all my life!
So why shouldn't I talk
disrespectfully?
Because she was in love!
- Love? Are you serious!
she is your mother.
So it's difficult to understand
this about her.
But when somebody is in
nothing is right or wrong!
Who told you all this?
In which stupid novel did
you read all these lines?
Everybody says so! All
is fair in love!
Everybody lies! It's
all hogwash! Got it?
Yes! Yes!
Listen! You are so rich!
Elope with my sister! Everybody's
life will prosper!
are an original piece!
Do you know that?
There is no other girl like you!
She has come!
Coming!
Hi, Amrik!
She has come! She has come!
Geet has come, aunt!
So what's the plan?
- Let's see!
You come inside with me!
No, no! No, Geet!  I will leave.
Where will you go?
I will be okay! Don't worry!
No! You come inside with me!
I can't let you go
like this! Come on!
Geet, really  I got to go!
Look, my family is here! Don't
create a scene in front of them!
You stay here for sometime.
I want to talk to you.
Then you can leave! Come on!
- Geet!
Hi, mother!
Geet!
- Hi, sexy aunt!
The authorities in the hostel
didn't look after my niece well!
She has become so thin!
How are you?
Come! Come! Come on!
Uncle!
Greetings, grandpa!
Who is this guy?
He is my friend, grandpa.
- What kind of friend?
Grandpa, that is not so!
- What?
I  he is just a friend.
- Then why did you bring him home?
he is the one
who has brought me home.
I missed the train at
a station in the night.
If he had not been
You know. A girl travelling alone
is like an open treasure box.
I didn't even know him.
We met on the train.
Still he has travelled
so far with me.
To Bhatinda! To escort
me home safely!
No other kind of friendship?
Because in my  in a
glimpse I get to

let Roop be Manjeet's wife!
When we were 8 years old,

But you people are very
intelligent, aren't you?
You people don't heed me!
Where are you? Open the garage!
Come on!
What are we doing here?
Look, Roop saw us going
towards the front gate!
They would have easily caught
us in their jeeps and bikes!
Now they will go out! They

They will search everywhere!
But they won't search the house!
So now we will wait here!
Then at the right time we will
leave from the

So go to sleep!
Fine! I will check the bus stand!
Take my cell along!
Don't worry! Everything
will be fine! Just watch!
You are consoling me, Geet?
I will just take a flight
and go away from all this!
What about you?
The way you are handling your
can get into a
grave problem, Geet!
Do you realise that?
Life is not just about fun
and merriment, Geet!
You have to be serious in life too!
Aditya, you were very
serious in life!
What was the use?
You got into a grave trouble too!
What is going to happen

Then they will give their consent.
Let's go.
Tell me the truth. What
I am doing. Is it right?
No! What you are doing is not right.
But you only had  that
when somebody is in

All is fair.
And if today I can understand

In the future your parents
will understand you.

There is some reason.
That I am enjoying
my life like this.
What is in the breeze?
That a slight intoxication
has entered me.
Don't ask what has happened to me.
Coming in your path.
Don't ask what I will get.
Coming in your arms.
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.
O God!
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.
