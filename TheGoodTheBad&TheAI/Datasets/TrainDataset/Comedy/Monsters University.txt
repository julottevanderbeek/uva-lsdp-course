{ALL MURMURING}
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear
a few words of inspiration.
Inspiration? Very well.
Scariness is the true

If you're not scary
what kind of
a monster are you?
It's my job to make
great students greater,
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.
That is why at the end of the

Fail that exam and you are

I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

So a roar wouldn't make him
scream, it would make him cry,
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

and of course
we can't have that.
So I'm afraid I cannot

Even with them
pink polka dots.
Aw, thanks.
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.
Your hands are
as big as my face!
He's like
a mountain with fur!
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.
Yeah, me neither. I don't
want to get too big. {SNIFFS}
We thought our dreams were
over, but Mike said if we win,
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.
We're going to
be real Scarers!
The best!
You betcha! {CHUCKLES}
Yeah! {CHUCKLES}
Right.
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?
We'll let you guys
get settled.
Anything you need, you just
give a big holler-oonie!
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?
Look, they don't
need to be good.
I'm going to
carry the whole team.
Really? And who's
going to carry you?
Hey, if you want to
go back to can design,
you know where the door is.
{FLICKING LIGHT SWITCH}
Great.
Guys?
Anybody home?
{CREAKING}
Um...
{STAMMERS} Hello?
Fellas?
Do you pledge your souls
to the Oozma Kappa
brotherhood?
Ow!
Do you swear to
keep secret...
...all that
you learn here?
No matter how horrifying?
Hey!
Will you take the sacred
oath of the... {GASPS}
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!
You're going to
ruin your eyes!
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.
Just pretend
I'm not here.
This is my mom's house.
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...
{DIAL CRANKING}
...no matter what the peril?
{WASHING MACHINE WHIRRING}
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?
From evils both
great and small?
In the face of
unending pain and...
Oh, forget it!
You're in.
Look, we know
we're no one's first choice
for a fraternity,
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.
{SIGHS}
{ALL CHEERING}
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!
Grab the couch cushions,

Wait a minute. Where
do they want us to meet?
Of all the sewers on campus, this
one has always been my favourite.
Art, you've been
here before?
I have a life outside

{CROWD CHEERING}
Welcome to your

Let's begin
the first competition,
the Toxicity Challenge!
{ALL CHEERING}
Human children are toxic!
And anything
they touch is toxic.
MALE ANNOUNCER= We don't
have any human toys,
but thanks to MU's
biology department,
we found a close second,
the stinging glow urchin!
{ALL GASP}
{ALL MURMURING}
Trust me when I say,
you are not gonna want
to touch this bad boy!
I want to touch it.
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.
{ALL GASP}
Yeah, I want to touch them.
This is
the starting line.
The light at the end of the
tunnel is the finish line.
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.
Mike...
{GASPS} What is it?
Does that mean if
we lose, we're out?
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!
Squishy.
We're not going to lose,
because we have everything
we need to win right here.
Heart.
No! Me. I'm going to
win the race for us.
SULLEY= All right, all right.
That's very cute,
It's an obstacle course. What
are you going to do? Roar at it?
I can get through faster
thank you, little guy.
Take your place at
the starting line!
This is
all about teamwork.
Everybody,
stick together.
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.
Get ready to eat my dust.
Hey, guys, should
we huddle up?
Attention, teams.
One last thing.
Scarers work in the dark.
{CRACKLING}
I want to go home!
On your marks...
Hey, uh,

Are you delirious?
I beat you!
Get your eye checked!
Oh, way to blow it,

Hey! Second place
ain't bad.
MALE ANNOUNCER=
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!
What?
Your whole team has to
cross the finish line.
MALE ANNOUNCER=
Third place, EEKs!
Fourth place, PNKs!
MIKE= No.
Fifth place, HSS!
No, no, no!
MALE ANNOUNCER=
And in last place,
Oozma Kappa.
I can't feel
my anything.
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!
No.
{BREATHING HEAVILY}
{GASPS}
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.
It would have taken
a miracle for you to...
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.
Jaws Theta Chi has
been disqualified.
{ALL GASP}
The use of illegal protective
gel is cause for elimination.
What!
{GROANS}
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!
It's a miracle!
Your luck will
run out, eventually.
This is going to be
harder than I thought.
MIKE= Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,
so that means
I'm going to need
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.
Mike?
{GASPS} What is it?
We've made a list of our
strengths and weaknesses.
In high school, I was the
master of the silent scare.
I could sneak up
on a field mouse
in a pillow factory.
{SQUISHING}
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.
Oh, my gosh,
that's terrible.
We're experts in the ancient
craft of close-up magic.
It's all about
misdirection.
Uh...
I have an extra toe.
{LAUGHS}
Not with me, of course.
Guys, one slip-up on the
next event, and we're goners.
So for this to work,
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have
and bury it deep,
deep down.
Done.
From now on,
we are of one mind.
My mind.
Oh, please.
I will tell you exactly
what to do, and how to do it.
ALL= Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.
All right.
Give me scary steps.
Fifty up and down,
right now. Let's go!
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.
{SCOFFS} We can't just
"get a new team"!
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.
What if we disguised a new
team to look like the old team?
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know,
levelling the playing field.
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?
They're not exactly the
scariest group in the world.
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish! Make a wish!
{BLOWS}
{ALL CHUCKLING}
This is not going to work.
Where are you going?
We're training.
I'm a Sullivan.
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.
You're charging
ahead when you...
Bup, bup, bup!
You tell them what
to do but not me.
So long, Coach.
{CLICKS TONGUE}
{BOTH GIGGLING}
Okay, Oozmas... {GASPS}
Boy, we need to
get you a bell.
Listen up. "If a kid hears you
coming, they'll call Mom or Dad,
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad. "
Huh?
In the next event, if
even one of us gets caught,
we're all out.
So remember,
do exactly what I do.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER= We are at the
halfway point of the second event,
and things are
getting interesting.
{SOFTLY} Got it.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER=
Only two teams left.
Who will make it
out with their flag,
and who will be eliminated?
you do not want to get
caught by a kid's parent.
And in this event, you do
not want to get caught by
the librarian.
{SHUSHING}

You should've
stuck to my strategy.
Whatever.
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

Hey! You guys

Oh, I think you've

We don't get invited to...

It's for the top Scare Teams.

still dance?
Because my moves
are a little rusty.
Oh, we forgot to
bring a hostess gift.
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.
Calm down.
We earned this.
{STAMMERS} What if there's
a lull in the conversation?
I never know what
to... You know...

How are you

You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

of a little party?

Raising a little
money for charity.
Yeah? Well, stop it.
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.
This guy hates charity!
I want you to stop
making us look like fools.
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.
Let's be honest, boys.
You're never going
to be real Scarers,
because real Scarers
look like us.
{LAUGHS MOCKINGLY}
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company
they're always
hiring in the mailroom.

Hey, hey, hey! Wait a

You can train monsters

but you can't
change who they are.

We appreciate everything
you've done, but he's right.
No matter how much we train,

Why? Why did you do this?

In case of what?
You don't think I'm scary.
Mike...
You said
you believed in me.
But you're just

You're just
like everyone else!
Look, you'll get
better and better...
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!
I just wanted to help.
No.
You just wanted

Welcome back, broham!
You are one

We got a call in, but

Let's get you out of here.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
You were right. They
weren't scared of me.
I did everything right.
I wanted it
more than anyone.
And I thought... I thought
if I wanted it enough,
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.
And I'm just
not.
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!
You do not know how I feel.
Mike, calm down.
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.
You can mess up
over and over again
and the whole world loves you.
Mike...
You'll never know
what it's like to fail
because you were
born a Sullivan!
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan
who flunked every test.
The one who got kicked out
of the program,
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down
that I cheated.
And I lied.
{SIGHS}
Mike, I'll never know
how you feel,
but you're not
the only failure here.
I act scary, Mike,

I'm terrified.
How come you never

Because
we weren't friends before.

if it wasn't for us.
What?
Well, {CHUCKLES} it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.
What?
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.
She invited us to
join next semester!

Congratulations, guys!
And that's not the

as your big brother
that's marrying

Wait. Hold on.
We're brothers who share

you'll keep in touch.

I'm okay just being okay.

Wazowski!
{SCREAMS}

Stop the bus!
{BRAKES SCREECHING}
Are you crazy?
{PANTING} Mike,
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.
I know,
everyone sees us together,
they think I'm the one running
the show, but the truth is,
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.
All I did was catch a pig!
Technically,
I caught the pig.
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?
You pulled off the biggest
Scare this school has ever seen!
That wasn't me!
That was you!
You think I could have
done that without you?
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.
But you are fearless.
And if Hardscrabble can't
see that, then she can just...
I can just what?
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.
Sorry.
Well, gentlemen,
it seems you made
the front page again.
The two of you did
something together
that no one has
ever done before.
You surprised me.
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises
like you in my program.
But as far as the two
of you are concerned
there is nothing
I can do for you now.
Except, perhaps,
wish you luck.
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.
You know,
there is still one way
we can work at
a Scare company.
They're always
hiring in the mailroom.
This is better
than I ever imagined!
I bet we break the all-time
record in our first year.
Mike, we're mail guys.
I know. I'm talking about the
record for letters delivered!
{GASPS}
All right, newbies,
quit goofing around.
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime
punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan
are going to change
the world starting today!
Say scream!
Scream!
