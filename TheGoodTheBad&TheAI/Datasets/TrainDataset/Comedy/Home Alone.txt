Ten million dollars
for the missile chip.
Not a plan...
but the chip itself.
BEAUPRE: Why the big price?
BOSS: My clients
have requested it.
l honor my clients' request.
Sounds like your clients
want to build a missile...
which can't be detected
by radar.
l don't ask questions,
Mr. Beaupre.
But whoever possesses
this chip...
could dominate
the entire region.
COOPER: Good night, George.
GUARD: Good night, Mr. Cooper.
He's clean.
COOPER: Here.
COOPER: Uh, that's, uh--ahem--
that's what you asked for.
Air Force MSB-100 ''C'' Series.
lf that goes in a missile,
air defenses can't stop it.
Look, l got a plane to catch.
Where's my money?
BEAUPRE: Here.
Hide it in the toy car.
BEAUPRE: We'll slip it
right past airport security.
BEAUPRE: Let's go.
P.A.: Welcome to San Francisco
lnternational Airport.
Please do not leave your bags
unattended.
Please remove your jewelry
and place it in the bowl.
-My jewelry?
-Yes, ma'am.
Step back.
Let's go.
GUARD: Ma'am,
you'll have to wait, please.
GUARD: Thank you.
WOMAN: Thank you.
GUARD: Next, please.
GUARD: Thank you.
GUARD: Next, please.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Move.
Move!
Young man!
l checked the Dallas, Miami,
New York, and Denver lounges.
Nothing.
JERNlGAN: Far as restaurants,
club lounges--they're clean.
UNGER: When l was in the john,
l didn't see anything in there.
BEAUPRE:
lt has to be on a plane.
We are going to Chicago.
UNGER: ln the winter?
l packed tropical.
PlLOT: Welcome to Chicago...
where it's a balmy
FLlGHT ATTENDANT:
Welcome to Chicago.
Welcome to Chicago.
WOMAN: Bye-bye.
WOMAN: There you go, sir.
MAN: Thanks.
Mr. Beaupre.
BEAUPRE:
Mr. Unger, Mr. Jernigan.
ALlCE: Excuse me. Excuse me.
BEAUPRE: Out of my way.
Move.
Did you check any bags, ma'am?
No. Floor it.
She's leaving.
Hey!
lt's him.
Excuse me, pop.
Can l ask you something?
CABBY: What?
JERNlGAN: You had a fare from
the airport around 1620 hours.
Senior citizen.
Female, Caucasian.
CABBY: What?
UNGER: About 4:30 today.
Old broad.
CABBY: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
UNGER: You got the address?
CABBY: Well, North Devon Park,
uh, Washington Street.
JERNlGAN:
Describe the house, please.
CABBY: Well, big, old...
uh, Tudor-like place.
JERNlGAN: Details.
CABBY: Christmas lights,
wreath on the door...
Christmas tree
at the end of the driveway.
And the driveway...
it was the only one on the block
that wasn't shoveled.
Unh.
Unh.
l'm all done, Mrs. Hess.
l'm exhausted and sweaty...
but you can't see
'cause l'm all covered up.
You were supposed to deal with
the snow promptly, weren't you?
-Yes, but--
-Butts are for ashtrays.
l don't care for excuses.
We had an understanding,
and you broke it.
Your word is worthless.
Sorry. That'll be no charge.
So you can tell
the neighborhood...
l stiffed you
on a snow removal job?
Mm-mmm.
ls this a loaf of the famous
San Francisco sourdough bread?
This won't make
a very tasty sandwich, will it?
Some silly,
inconsiderate boob...
who took my bag...
l left my bread
in San Francisco.
Pardon me, Mrs. Hess...
but l think l'm almost, maybe...
possibly, probably...
gonna be late for my dinner.
Consider this your payment.
l have no use
for the silly thing.
Thank you.
And have your mother
teach you...
that it is rude
to scratch yourself...
in the presence of a lady.
Good night, Alex.
Jeez, what a grouch.
ALlCE: They're all old.
Most of them are Tudor.
They all have wreaths
and old Christmas trees.
And the snow's
all been shoveled.
There are 14 houses.
The toy car
must be in one of them.
We're going to have
to search them all.
We'll come back when it's light.
UNGER: We're gonna work houses
in broad daylight?
BEAUPRE: These are the suburbs,
Mr. Unger.
Nobody's home during the day.
SlNGERS: Whoa whoa oh.
You know l'm almost grown.
Whoa whoa oh.
Yeah, and l'm doing all right
in school.
Nah ooh ooh.
They ain't said l broke no rule.
Nah ooh ooh.
l ain't never been in Dutch.
Nah ooh ooh...
ALEX: There you go, Speedy.
SlNGERS: Nah ooh ooh.
lt don't bother me to be alone.
Nah whoa whoa ooh ooh.
Anyway l'm almost grown.
Nah doo way.
Rah ta ta ta ta.
Nah doo way.
Whoa whoa.
Nah doo way.
Whoa whoa.
Nah doo way.
Whoa whoa.
Nah doo way.
Ow.
ALEX: Ugh.
SlNGERS: Nah doo way.
Whoa whoa.
Nah doo way.
Whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa oh.
Whoa whoa oh.
Nah doo way.
KAREN: Charlie,
we went through this last year.
l told you then,
l can't work weekends.
CHARLlE: Why not?
KAREN: l've got three kids
and a husband.
Well, that's Mary Lou.
She has no life.
lt means nothing to her
to work weekends.
l can't do that.
l'm living in a house
that's half-renovated.
My kids have activities.
They need to see their parents
doing something...
other than running out
to the car.
JACK: l can't really explain
over the phone...
why we're so excited
about this product.
MAN: You'll be here
on Wednesday?
JACK: l'll be in Cleveland
on Wednesday.
Yeah, Wednesday.
We'll talk about it then,
face-to-face.
-Man-to-man?
-Yeah, man-to-man.
All right. See you then.
FEMALE SlNGERS:
Well, l'm anxious and restless.
l guess that's what it's like
to be young.
Oh, well,
l'm anxious and restless.
l guess that's what it's like
to be young.
MALE SlNGER: All l wanted was
a skateboard, but now l got one.
All l wanted was a skateboard...
but now l got one.
All l wanted was a skateboard...
but now l got one.
All l wanted was a skateboard...
but now l got one.
Hey, stupid.
PARROT: Your brother's bug.
Your brother's bug.
Careful. Careful!
PARROT: Bull's-eye.
PARROT: Three from downtown.
And the crowd goes wild.
Oh, man.
l hope they're not...
Aaaahhh!
Alex slammed the toilet seat
down on his thing again!
PARROT: Bull's-eye.
Alex?
What happened?
STAN:
l had nothing to do with this.
JACK: l gotta go.
My kid slammed the toilet seat
on his thing again.
l'll call you back.
Alex?
KAREN: Keep that in your mouth.
ALEX: Mmm.
KAREN: Chickenpox.
STAN:
Mom, with all due respect...
it's a scam to get out
of his science project...
because his bug died.
What?
His face doesn't look that bad.
But his body is covered.
Would that include
his buttock region?
Shut up!
This is great.
lf he scratches
his chicken spots...
we can call him scarbutt.
KAREN: Leave!
JACK: Good-bye.
l'll go make you some soup.
l'll bring the TV up
from the family room.
KAREN: Oh, l'm so sorry.
JACK: Hey. Don't scratch.
KAREN:
Keep that under your tongue.
l'll be right back.
Nice family, huh, Doris?
SlNGER: Up in the morning,
off to school.
JACK: You should get going.
STAN: See you later, dad.
SlNGER: To teach you
the golden rule.
American history
and practical math.
You study them hard
and hope to pass.
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
SlNGER: Feeling is there,
body and soul.
Ring, ring goes the bell.
Mr. Greenfield's 401k
is invested in the ltha fund.
You have it listed
in the Midcap fund.
That's where
your 3,000 shortfall is.
OK?
BRUCE: We'll make it up
next quarter.
Bruce, can l--l have to put you
on hold one second.
Alex? l'm on with the office.
So l think that what we need--
l'm really sorry, Bruce.
Can l call you back?
- Sure.
-Thanks.
Gotcha.
You rang?
Thirsty?
Thanks, mom.
REALTOR: Oh, here we are.
WOMAN: l wish my husband
could have been here today.
REALTOR:
Well, it's a cozy little place.
WOMAN:
Well, isn't this charming?
REALTOR:
And it's available immediately.
My boys are just gonna
love it here.
Yes, they will.
TV: Plus special care
and feeding tips...
next on Pets on Parade.
Look, Doris.
lf you think that was amusing,
wait'll you see what l do next.
Oh, yeah.
ANNOUNCER:
This is a very important piece.
Hmm?
SlNGER: Ah ah ah ah.
SlNGER: lt's wearing me down.
ALlCE: Sit.
UNGER: l can't wait
for next week.
l hate dogs.
Charlie,
we've been over all this.
You know l can't come in.
Alex is sick.
Oh, God, you're kidding.
How long is he in town?
No, that's OK.
Mary Lou can handle it.
She can. She can access the--
No.
l know l promised you...
but my child wasn't sick then.
There's no--
OK, fine. One hour.
l can come in for one hour.
That's it.
lf Alex beeps me, l'm gone.
You can fire me if you want to,
but l'm gone.
And Charlie...
You're putting me in the
position of having to choose...
between making a house payment
or caring for my sick child...
and l really
don't appreciate it.
Jerk.
Did you tell Charlie
that l'm desperately ill?
Thank you, Alex.
Yes, Charlie knows you're sick.
What about the Family Leave Act?
l just have to go
pick up some stuff...
and sign some papers
and show my face.
l'll be gone an hour
at the very most.
l called Mrs. Hess
and told her you'd be alone--
You called Mrs. Hess?
She knows l'm gonna be alone?
She said if anything comes up,
she'll be right over.
She wasn't happy about it, but--
She could get tanked up
on iced tea...
and come over
and make me smoke cigarettes.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
What do l do
if there's a tornado?
They don't happen in winter.
-Social unrest?
-l don't think so.
Boredom? l hear it's deadly
in old folks.
KAREN: Good-bye, sweetie.
What about crooks?
l don't think that's a problem
during the day, honey.
Why not?
Nobody's home during the day.
l'm only eight,
and l figured that out.
Don't you think a grown-up crook
would figure it out, too?
This is a very safe
neighborhood.
There's only one road
in and out of here...
the doors will be locked,
you have all my numbers.
l'll be home as soon as l can.
But, mom, what about dragons...
giant spiders, mummies,
the living dead...
and other figments
of my imagination?
Alex, l can't help you there.
Only you can control
your imagination.
That's a scary thought.
Hmm.
That's weird.
Oh, my God.
Twenty second's out.
Clear.
-911 emergency.
-l saw a burglar.
Are you by yourself?
My mom just had to run out
for a few minutes.
l have the chickenpox.
Can l have your address, please?
The guy isn't at my house.
He's at the Stephans'.
Their address
is 3015 Washington Street.
BEAUPRE: Nothing.
There's a burglar
in the Stephans' house!
l saw him with my telescope.
There was one with a dog
in a gray van...
and a man in running clothes.
l didn't recognize anybody
but the dog.
He looked just like
Johnny Allen's dog...
so l called the police.
KAREN: You called the police?
OFFlCER: Check the back.
Yes, sir.
Freeze!
OFFlCER: The burglar alarm
was on and working.
There was no one in the house.
lt doesn't appear
that anything's been taken.
l don't know what he saw, but...
there wasn't a person
in that house.
l'm very sorry about this.
My son's been home
with the chickenpox.
l had to run to work
to pick up some papers.
l'm completely strapped.
l don't normally do this.
OFFlCER: Son, false alarms
are no joking matter.
lt wasn't a false alarm !
There was a guy in the house--
he had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray van.
He's been running a fever.
You might want to remind him
that ours is serious business.
Oh, he knows.
We gave him a police set
for Christmas--
not this Christmas,
but last Christmas--
you know, one of those--
a badge and a hat and a whistle.
He took it very seriously.
He went around the house...
arresting relatives
for various crimes.
Oh. Not real crimes--
Just for leaving the toilet
seat up and snoring and...
Absolutely. l will, yes.
Thank you. Thank you.
You get in bed, young man.
Excuse me, but l saw a man
in Karen Stephans' bedroom.
A white male
a little older than dad...
and he was wearing
butt-inspection gloves.
Oh, l have warned you
about that telescope.
You look through it long enough
you'll start seeing things...
whether or not they're there.
l guess you have to be 35
before anyone listens.
Don't get smart with me, Alex.
Sick or not,
l am very angry with you.
You have caused
a lot of trouble today.
We have to replace
the Stephans' door.
Think we're happy about that?
l saw what l saw.
Peter Beaupre...
Earl Unger...
Burton Jernigan...
and Alice Ribbons.
They were ticketed
under known aliases...
but didn't board
the Hong Kong flight.
l believe they're still
in the U.S....
but beyond that, l don't know.
Ladies and gentlemen...
we've got to find that chip.
ALlCE: What went wrong
with the burglar alarm?
BEAUPRE: Nothing.
lt wasn't the alarm.
UNGER:
Then who called the police?
Mr. Jernigan, care to speculate?
ALlCE: Cars came and went.
The mailman came by.
We could have a watcher
on any house in any street.
lt could be anybody.
BEAUPRE:
l don't think it's just anybody.
l think it's someone
on our street.
Someone we are not tracking.
Someone we've missed.
Dad, cab's here.
JACK: Oh, shoot.
Your mom's not back yet.
Well, all right.
Mom had to take some documents
to the bank.
She can't be gone
more than a few minutes.
Mrs. Hess is home.
You'll be fine, OK?
My beeper number's
on the speed dial.
Second button.
Mom's on the first button.
Right. Yeah.
-So, you're OK?
-Positutely.
Give me a kiss.
All right.
Dad?
Listen. This is a very safe
and secure neighborhood.
We have great police,
as you learned yesterday.
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you. OK?
-Dad?
-Yeah.
-Got your tickets?
-Yep.
Got your wallet?
Yeah, it's in my pocket.
Where's your pocket?
Yeah.
Thank you.
ALEX: Bye, dad.
She's leaving.
Three-Zero-Two-Five
is all clear.
Red sedan heading south.
Turning right. Hold.
Ohh.
Hi. You are just in time...
Mr. Pruitt.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Abort. Abort.
Evacuate the area.
l'm on my own.
Let's go.
OFFlCER: Move! Move!
OFFlCER: Over there!
Cool.
Come on.
Nothing.
OTHER OFFlCER:
Let's check upstairs.
So, uh, where's the burglar?
There is no burglar.
Just a kid home sick from school
making false alarms.
How embarrassing.
Mm-hmm.
lt's the second time in two days
you've called the police.
lt's a very serious matter
when a person calls the police.
l saw a burglar yesterday,
and l saw a burglar today.
KAREN:
Alex, listen to the chief.
There was no one in that house.
What about Johnny Allen's dog?
l talked to Johnny last night.
His dog was kidnapped
on Monday morning.
Did he see it happen?
KAREN:
Alex, apologize to the chief...
and go up to your room.
Excuse me
for being a good citizen.
KAREN: Alex!
l'm very sorry.
This will not happen again,
will it, honey?
KAREN: Really, l promise you.
CHlEF: We wouldn't want to
discourage him from calling...
in the event that something real
ever does happen.
PARROT: Loser.
-Shut up.
-Make me.
STAN: Now that you've
pranked the cops twice...
it goes on
your permanent record.
For the rest of your life,
if you call for help...
it won't come.
STAN: Dad missed his plane.
MOLLY: He was late
for a meeting with his boss.
We have to fork over
much needed family cash...
to the Stephans
and to an evil octogenarian...
so they can have
their doors repaired.
MOLLY: And even worse...
The world laughs, Alex.
You've stained the family name.
First the Stephans,
then Mrs. Hess.
l agree, Doris.
The next stop
is the Alcotts' house.
What kind of a burglar
goes into a house...
and doesn't take anything?
Do you know what l think?
l think they're looking
for something special.
They're looking
in everybody's house...
'cause they don't know
who has it.
Question is...
what is it?
lf nobody's gonna do anything
about this...
l'll just have to do it myself.
l am so sorry.
l'm clearly not awake.
lt's all right.
Have a nice day.
l'll try.
Watch this, Doris.
Huh?
Hmm.
Look, Doris.
Boo!
l forgot about the stairs.
Hmm.
Got him, Doris. We got him.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
You are so busted.
-Hah!
-Aah!
l have it.
The toy car.
lt's videotaping me.
Huh?
What?
Come back on that last message.
Hoo-aah!
Aah! Ow!
Ow! Grrr!
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't spin. Don't spin.
CLAUDE AKlNS: You there.
Now, you was friendly to me.
l don't wanna kill you.
CHUCK CONNORS: You got money
doesn't belong to you.
AKlNS: Now, you back off.
This ain't your business.
CONNORS: All right, now.
Drop the saddle bags.
Brnnng brnnng!
PARROT: Hello. This is Karen.
Hi. How's it going?
Huh? Yeah, l'm running late
for the office again.
l think blue chips
are overvalued.
Technology stocks will be good.
Technology stocks.
Listen, l'm in the shower.
Can l call you back?
PARROT :
Bad, bad Leroy Brown.
Baddest cat
in the whole damn town.
PARROT :
Badder than ol' King Kong.
Meaner than a junkyard dog.
Come on, come on, come on.
See ya!
Ohh!
Unh. Unh.
The car's outside.
l got a woman in the house.
Get over here.
Come on, get up!
Unh.
Aah!
Ohh!
Ow! Ooh!
Shh! Come on!
Tsk. Everybody's in a hurry.
lt's a video camera.
Someone's onto us.
UNGER:
You think it really matters?
Chip's in the car.
We're at the airport
in 45 minutes.
BEAUPRE: Where's Alice?
What happened?
There is a woman in the house.
l'll go back in
and deal with her.
Get the chip.
Hmm.
Unh.
Whoa!
Unh.
Yes!
l got it.
Ma'am?
May l have a word with you?
PARROT: Don't come in.
l'm naked.
PARROT: What's on your mind,
monkey butt?
Come on. Come--
PARROT:
What's that funky smell?
l lost it!
What?!
Come on! Go, go, go.
lt's going out of range!
l got it!
Aah!
Unh!
Aah!
Unh.
l see it.
Look out.
Aah!
Ohh!
BEAUPRE:
Jernigan, which direction?
lt got past me.
lt's heading south on Adams...
but l'm right behind
the little--
lt's off the street,
going through backyards...
heading west.
Alice, what's your position?
Ow! Ooh! Unh!
Fourth house.
Move to the alley.
l see it!
lt's going through the hedge.
Jernigan, position.
You're there.
l got it!
ALlCE: l got it! Aah!
Ow! Unh!
Unger, what's your position?
Heading to Washington Street.
JERNlGAN:
l didn't copy. Where?
UNGER: l said l'm heading
to Wa--Aah-aah-aah!
Oh! Unh!
UNGER: Stop, you nitwit!
Aah!
Unh!
l don't see anything.
l'll look around.
l don't have it yet.
BEAUPRE: We're out of time.
Give it up.
They got the tape.
Why did they still chase
the toy car?
lt's not that expensive.
l'm sure they don't have
enough time to play with it.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Hmm.
Look, Doris.
Computer chip, huh?
Where did you find it?
l found it
in a remote control car...
that l got for shoveling snow
for Mrs. Hess.
She lives across the street
from us.
lt says ''U.S. Air Force''
on it...
but you have to look under
a magnifying glass to see it.
Kid, a lot of toys have
''Air Force'' written on them.
This is a recruiting office,
son.
We don't handle matters
like this.
Can l give you the number
on the chip...
so you can call someone?
Do you think we should tell mom
about the chip?
Yeah, l guess you're right.
The less they know, the better.
Those guys are bad news.
UNGER: l can't tell you
how much l appreciate...
you hitting me with the minivan.
JERNlGAN:
Never let your emotions...
get the best of you.
You weren't paying attention.
You should have been
more vigilant.
UNGER: You should have taken
driver's ed.
ALlCE: lt's a kid.
lt has to be a kid.
UNGER: l'm gonna have bad knees
when l'm old...
and l'll have Burton Jernigan
to thank.
The cops come twice.
They don't believe the kid.
He takes matters
into his own hands.
lt can't be anything else.
lf that's the case...
l say take no chances.
Tomorrow, whack every kid
in the neighborhood.
Burn 'em all.
Then look for that stupid car.
My thoughts keep turning
to number 3026.
lt's in the operating radius
of the toy car.
lt's on the sightlines
of all the houses l've been in.
Hello?
BOSS: Do you have
the missile chip?
BEAUPRE: We are close.
lf l don't have the chip
in 24 hours, Mr. Beaupre...
l will have no choice
but to terminate the mission...
and nullify
all the participants.
You understand, don't you?
Guys, dad's home tomorrow night.
l have my quarterly client
meeting from noon till 5:00...
so l you and Molly come
straight home...
to stay with Alex
until dad gets home.
MOLLY: l can't. No way.
lmpossible. l have gymnastics.
-l have hockey.
-Do l need to repeat myself?
Weren't you putting the bite
on Mrs. Hess to watch him?
MOLLY: Yeah. She's a lot more
responsible than me and Stan.
Mrs. Hess is a backup.
Unless there's an emergency...
l really don't want to have
to call her.
l'll be fine by myself.
STAN: Well, there you have it.
Settled.
Alex, could you pass me
the false alarms?
Excuse me. l'm sorry.
l meant the peas.
Ho ho.
KAREN: Hello? Oh, hi.
Uh-huh. Yeah, he's been home
with the chickenpox.
Oh. Alex,
do you know a Bradley Clovis?
Yeah.
This is his mother on the phone.
Did you take a toy car from him?
No. He has one of those
remote control cars...
but he got it from the woman
across the street.
We have it.
Alex, what is the matter
with you?
You don't disconnect my calls.
Don't talk to Mrs. Clovis,
please!
-Why not?
-She's dangerous!
Dangerous? Honey, what are--
lt was lies. They're all lies.
lt wasn't her.
What do you mean?
Call her back.
l think you'll be surprised.
Outgoing call.
Rerouted.
Hello. Clovises'.
Hi. l beg your pardon.
We just--
Oh, l'm sorry.
Did l disconnect you...Karen?
No, no. lt was me.
We're renovating.
The phone lines are a mess.
ALEX :
They intercepted the phone call.
Listen, l didn't mean
to accuse your son.
l'm certain Bradley
just misplaced his toy car.
KAREN:
lsn't that the way they are?
They lose something...
they immediately assume
it's been stolen.
Little boys do have
wild imaginations, don't they?
Yes, they do.
They're gonna come after me
tomorrow, Doris.
Nobody will listen--
not my parents or Molly...
or Stan or the police...
or the Air Force.
Nobody.
So what do l do?
lf that means hide,
you are wrong.
lf that means fight,
you're right.
They'll understand
when l'm done.
They'll know
l was telling the truth.
l'm not gonna cry
or feel sad or scared.
They're grownups,
and they're criminals...
but this is my neighborhood,
and this is my house...
and no matter how old they are,
no matter how big they are...
they can't beat me here.
They can't beat me at home.
PARROT: Rawk! Ohh.
PARROT:
Want to buy a little silence?
Double or nothing.
Rawk!
OlNGO BOlNGO :
Where are we going?
Are we going home again?
Home again, home again.
Home again.
OlNGO BOlNGO:
Where are we going?
Are we going home again?
Home again, home again.
Home again.
OlNGO BOlNGO:
Where are we going?
Home again, go home again.
Home again.
We're watching
a major snowstorm...
that's bearing down
on Chicagoland.
As you look
at the latest radar...
you can see the snow's
increasing in intensity.
Heavy snow's in the forecast...
and residents are urged
to stay indoors if possible.
Approaching target.
All clear.
Here we go, Doris.
-
-Whoa!
No! Stop!
First we free the hostages.
ALlCE:
Switching on the fiber optics.
KAREN:
Alex, can you get the door?
No answer.
Are we certain target
has not left?
JERNlGAN: Negative.
We'd have seen that.
l repeat--
there is no movement inside.
Permission to enter.
Aah!
No, Rollie, no!
No! No!
Aah!
JERNlGAN: Alice?
Hey! Go home. Go home.
ALlCE: l need assistance.
l'm exposed.
Maintain your position.
Do not--l repeat--do not
draw attention to yourself.
Pick her up.
We'll move in
after the storm hits.
We'll let mother nature
cover our tracks.
Sir, this just came in
from the Air Force.
Some kid named Pruitt...
called a recruiting office
in Chicago.
Said he found a computer chip
in a toy car.
We're going to Chicago.
Did you watch the weather
for me?
ALEX: Yep. No problems.
Coat's over there.
KAREN: Oh, thanks.
l wanted to wear my brown one.
Wait! Why don't you go
fill your commuter cup...
with yummy hot coffee,
and l'll get your coat for you?
Thanks, hon.
KAREN:
l'll make you a sandwich.
ALEX: Here's your coat.
KAREN: Thanks.
Oh, sweetheart,
l am so sorry about this week.
lt breaks my heart
to come and go like this.
lt shouldn't be this way.
lt's OK. lt's not you.
lt's the times.
Thanks, hon.
KAREN: You have your beeper?
ALEX: Yep.
KAREN: Great.
l'll call every half hour.
KAREN:
l'll go online with you...
and keep the connection open
all day.
l'll have my laptop with me
at all my meetings.
We'll be in contact
at all times.
Plus, l have my cellular,
and you've got my fax number.
ALEX: We're wired.
Oh, my gosh,
did Mrs. Clovis call?
She was gonna stop by
before l left...
to confirm that Bradley's name
was on the remote control car.
She stopped by
when you were in the shower.
-Did you let her have it?
-Big time.
l hope she felt foolish.
lt was painful.
OK. Be good.
Be safe.
Keep an eye on the old place.
l got it all covered.
Here we go, Doris.
lt's just you and me.
You mean there's someone else?
PARROT: Get ready to rumble!
Play ball!
ROCK SlNGER: This is my town.
Watch your step
if you come around.
l don't think l know you.
Well, maybe it's time
to show you.
This is my home.
l'll be standing here alone...
and if you're ready
to see hell...
come on in and ring the bell.
Hello, Mr. Hip.
Finally you got your hit.
Coming from the nowhere.
Sliding 'cross the clover.
Hello, Lady Slick.
Did you pull another trick?
Beautiful makeover.
Make the perfect cover.
Didn't you know...
things don't come easy, so...
this is my town.
Watch your step
if you come around.
And if you're ready
to see hell...
PARROT: Aha.
The old switcheroo.
Come on.
PARROT: lt's show time.
PARROT: lf those are real,
l'm an eagle.
ROCK SlNGER:
Perfect stranger, re-arranger.
l think we're in super danger.
ALlCE: Block the street.
ROCK SlNGER: This is my town.
Watch your step
if you come around...
and if you're ready
to see hell...
come on in and ring the bell.
Ring the bell, ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Ring the bell.
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on in, come on.
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on in. Come on.
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Hess.
lt's Karen Pruitt.
Could you possibly
look in on Alex for me?
MRS. HESS: l'm just going out.
KAREN: l'm at work.
l'm really in a bind.
Oh. Well...how long?
KAREN: lt wouldn't be
for more than an hour or so.
MRS. HESS:
All right. No cooking.
''Call Mrs. Hess.
''Well, she's retired.
''What else
could she possibly be doing?''
A Baby-sitter.
Do they invite me into their
house for a holiday eggnog?
Well, of course not.
BEAUPRE:
Look who woke from her nap.
PARROT:
Crooks at 30 yards and closing.
Let the party begin.
ALlCE: Good afternoon.
My husband and l have just
moved into your neighborhood.
What do you want,
a wilkie button?
A package
was to be delivered to us...
but the driver got confused,
and perhaps he brought it here.
MRS. HESS: Nope.
No delivery here.
The delivery company said
that no one answered the door...
and the driver left it
in the garage.
MRS. HESS: Sometimes they leave
stuff at the back door.
Why are you closing the door?
l left my heart
in San Francisco.
Looks like that little rugrat
has the place locked up tight.
Jernigan,
l think l'm gonna to enjoy this.
lt's been a long time
since l was a kid.
You forget
how incredibly stupid they are.
JERNlGAN: You be careful.
Sometimes when kids get scared,
they wet their pants.
Ooh!
Ohh!
Unh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ohh!
Ohh! Unh!
Yee-aah!
Unh! Aah!
Aah-aah-aah-aah!

Yaah!
Ehh. Huhh.

Ohh!
Hyah!
Uhh-uhh-uhh-uhh!
Aah-aah-aah-aah!
Aah!
Unh!
Aah...
Mr. Unger, what are you doing?
Don't touch the yarn.
lt's wired.
UNGER: Kid's got the place
booby-trapped.
Make no assumptions.
Watch the welcome mat.
This boy's clever.
Have you tried the door?
Uh, not yet.
Let me point something out
to you.
Missed that.
Stand clear.
Maybe he's not so clever
after all.
Yeah, l--l just think
we're having an off day.
BOTH: Ohh!
A thought for you to consider:
At airport security...
make sure you have
the right package.
l certainly hope
that you're not...
fond of that little boy
across the street.
l'll leave this open.
: Wait.
Fresh air will be good for you.
Ohh. Ohh.
You think you're smart,
you little brat.
Unger, what's your status?
Unger. Unger?
Whoo. Hwah!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
BEAUPRE: Brrrrr.
UNGER: Unh.
Heads up.
-How did that happen?
-l don't know.
Unh.
Ouch.
You got hit with a book?
UNGER: Books.
Plural.
A trunk full of books.
Then a set of weights.
We got hit twice,
you dumb broad.
Excuse me, Mr. Unger.
l didn't get taken down
by an infant.
BEAUPRE: We didn't anticipate
the defense the boy would mount.
l'll go in the front.
Mr. Unger,
you take the north side.
Alice, you take the south side.
Where is Mr. Jernigan?
Ohh ohh! Ohh!
Ohh! Ohh! Ooh!
DEAN MARTlN: Oh, the weather
outside is frightful...
DEAN MARTlN: Oh, the weather
outside is frightful...
but the fire is so delightful.
And there's
simply no place to go.
DEAN MARTlN ON P.A.:
Let it snow...
let it snow, let it snow.
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Attention, travelers.
All flights to Chicago
continue to be delayed...
due to severe weather.
Please stand by
for further details.
Ohh! Ow-wow-wow-wow!
Wow!
Hi.
Eee...
Aah! Ow!
Ohh! Ohh!
You can run,

Surprise.

-Aah!
-Ohh!

Waah!
Aah!
Aah!
Mr. Jernigan, Mr. Unger!
Welcome.
You got a haircut?
Are you almost done in there?
Don't start with me.
l'll wait.
JERNlGAN: Let's move.
ALlCE: Ugh. What stinks?
UNGER: Shut up.
Hello?
KAREN: Honey, you're all out
of breath. ls something wrong?
No, no. Everything's fine.
l'm so worried.
The weather is terrible.
l'm gonna come home right now.
No, no. Take your time, really.
Don't come home, mom.
Um, why don't you pick up
Stan and Molly from school?
KAREN: Are you sure?
ALEX: Yeah. l'm playing
Chinese checkers with Mrs. Hess.
KAREN: You're not smoking,
are you?
No. l got to go.
Mrs. Hess gets nutty
when you make her wait.
-OK. Play fair.
-Always.
What a brave little fellow.
ALlCE: Mr. Jernigan.
-Living room--clear.
-Good.
UNGER: Mmm.
Nothing in the kitchen.
ALlCE: Let's organize.
Mr. Unger, you turn left.
Mr. Jernigan, follow me, slowly.
Go, Doris.
Ah.
ALlCE: Mr. Unger, go left.
Cover him.
l'll cover the stairs.
l'm comin' for you, shorty...
comin' to pay you back for
all the misery you caused me.
Mr. Unger, what are you doing?
Kid's in the closet.
Scared him a little
just before l grab him.
And behind door number one...
Towels.
Hmmph.
l saw this door close.
ldiot.
Would l make it up?
Why? What's the point?
We working on commission here?
Whew. Ah-choo!
What's going on?
You're Mrs. Pruitt
from Washington Street?
-Yes.
-Agent Stuckey, FBl.
l came to talk to your son.
You called the Air Force
about a computer chip...
in a remote control car?
No.
Oh, God, it's Alex.
lt's--it's my--my other son.
Why? What's happened?
He may be in danger.
He's not here. He's at home.
Well, let's move.
Why is he in danger?
She asked you a question, sir.
l'm not at liberty
to discuss it, son.
The ''it'' you're referring to...
is my little brother.
We think he intercepted...
a top-secret
electronic device...
stolen from a defense
department contractor...
by a group
of international criminals...
working for a North Korean
terrorist organization.
Mr. Jernigan. Cover me.
Green-eyed lady.
Ocean lady.
Soothing every raging wave...
that comes.
ALEX: Go, Doris, go.
: Green-eyed lady.
Ocean lady.
Soothing every raging wave...
that comes.
Green-eyed lady.
Lovely lady.
Strolling slowly...
towards the sun.
PARROT: Sorry, Charlie.
PARROT:
This just ain't your day.
Aah.
ALlCE: Shut up.
Aah!
-What?
-Don't move.
Alice?
Don't...move.
Alice?
What?
Alice?
Shh-shh-shh.
Alice?
Hyah!
: Oooohhh!
Excellent.
Run, shorty, run, shorty!
Come on, Doris!
The kid!
Doris, come on!
l got you now, you little rat!
l got him !
-Unh!
-Unh!
Whoa!
Unh!
Ohh!
You...smacked my winkie.
Well, if you changed
your shorts once in a while...
maybe you wouldn't have
rats in your pants!
Come here, you little rugrat!
ALlCE: Where is he?
Stay here, Doris.
Yikes.
Come on!
He's been watching us
the whole time.
He had a camera on us.
You're not gonna
find me up there...
you big, dumb,
lawbreaking knuckleheads!
ALL: He's outside!
Recognize this?
UNGER: How'd he get outside?
ALlCE: The same way
you're gonna get outside.
-How?
-Jump! Go!
Don't push!
ALlCE: lt's a trampoline.
You're jumping
onto a trampoline.
UNGER: l presume
you won't be joining us?
No. l'll be covering you
from here. Go!
ALlCE: How comforting!
JERNlGAN: He's gettin' away!
UNGER: Yeah, this is a snap.
This is a snap.
Go!
Huh?
JERNlGAN: Oh, God!
UNGER: Cold. Very cold.
Aah!
Aah!
Of course.
Here l come, you little brat.
Ouch.
Mrs. Hess!
Mrs. Hess.
Mrs. Hess?
MRS. HESS: Hmm?
You're OK.
l'm here now.
BEAUPRE: Well...
lt's Alex, isn't it?
Today you learned something--
there is a price to be paid
for being a good citizen.
ln your zeal to aid
your neighbor...
you finally stepped
into one of my traps.
Can Mrs. Hess go inside?
She's very old and very cold.
Please?
Give me the chip!
ALEX: lt doesn't belong to you.
lt's not yours.
The chip, son.
Give me the chip.
That doesn't belong to you,
either.
What?
That's not your gun.
This is your gun.
-Yah!
-Huhh!
Gotcha.
Here, sit down, Mrs. Hess.
Thank you, Alex.
ALEX: These are times
that call for soup.
Any favorites?
MRS. HESS: No, thank you.
l'm--l'm fine, honey.
Ha.
ALEX: You know, Mrs. Hess...
it's really cold outside.
You're a pretty tough old bird.
And you're
a very sweet young man.
l just never took the time
to notice.
You're not alone in that.
Wow.
Johnson, Williams,
go around back.
Freeze!
You gotta be kidding.
Let's go! Move it! Move it!
Alex.
Mom !
Ohh.
Ohh!
Mom...
You're hugging and kissing me
in front of the cops.
Oh, Alex.
l'm so sorry.
l'm so sorry
l didn't listen to you.
This is very cool.
MOLLY: Bud, you're a hero.
-Are you Alex?
-Yeah.
Agent Stuckey, FBl.
Here's the chip.
There's a senior citizen
across the street...
who need some soup
and a doctor to check her feet.
There's 2 guys in our pool
and a woman in our basement.
The other one's gone.
This him?
Yup.
Seven years
l've been after this guy.
He always manages to slip away.
Thanks.
OFFlCER:
lt's just the three, sir.
STUCKEY: Where's your boss?
STUCKEY: Get 'em out of here.
OFFlCER: Yes, sir.
Let's go, popsicle.
Come on.
Ha ha ha!
PARROT: Lucy, l'm home!
PARROT: What's on your mind,
monkey butt?
PARROT :
Bad, bad Leroy Brown.
Shhhhhh.
PARROT:
Houston, we have a problem.
Counting down,
in five, four, three...
two...
Take it.
PARROT: Double or nothing.
l only have one.
PARROT: We have ignition.
lt's show time!
Now, l'll be there
in just a minute.
OK, bye.
Driver,
it's the big old Tudor place...
with the Christmas lights
in the driveway...
that hasn't been shoveled.
-Eh?
-That one right there.
Oh.
Um...
Have you ever had
the chickenpox?
l had the chickenpox...
when Herbert Hoover
was in the White House.
Hello.
-Hey there, stranger.
-Hi.
Dad!
Hi, sweetie.
Hey! Come here.
Let me see.
Ah, you don't look
any worse for the wear.
They couldn't touch me.
The computer company
that got their chip boosted...
is giving Alex a reward.
lt's a 6-figure sum,
which is extremely cool.
So, did you bring me anything?
As a matter of fact, l did.
Come here.
JACK: Think you can drive that?
ALEX: l think we can handle it.
PARROT: Awk!
Gentlemen, start your engines!
Man overboard!
Say cheese.
