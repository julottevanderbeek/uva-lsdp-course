AND THEN THERE'S
A BIG EXPLOSION
AND LOTS OF BUBBLES.
THAT'S WHERE BABIES
COME FROM.
OH, WELL, CLOSE ENOUGH.
I DID THE MATH ONCE.
IT TURNS OUT EVERY 17.4 DINNERS
MY FAMILY ACTUALLY HAS
A PLEASANT MEAL TOGETHER.
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.
I MADE A PEA ANGEL.
OH, YOU'RE A PEA ANGEL.
STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR FOOD.
OH, MOM...
DON'T YOU DARE.
RELAX, I WASN'T
REALLY GOING TO.
THEN DON'T.
I WASN'T GOING TO.
THEN DON'T.
WELL, DON'T ACCUSE ME
OF SOMETHING
THAT I WASN'T GOING TO DO.
INTERESTING MOOD SHIFT.
IT WOULD TAKE HOURS TO EXPLAIN
THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND THIS.
SO LET ME JUST PUT IT THIS WAY:
DYNAMITE...
KID WITH MATCHES.
YOU'RE GOING TO THROW
THAT AT MOM?
I WASN'T GOING TO.
JEEZ LOUISE. REESE...
HAL, I CAN HANDLE THIS.
REESE, I'M WARNING YOU.
I WASN'T GOING TO.
BUT IF YOU THINK I WOULD,
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD.
OH, GOOD.
NOW HE'S PANICKING.
JUST PUT THE SPOON DOWN
AND APOLOGIZE.
OKAY, SHE GAVE
HIM AN OUT.
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?
I WASN'T GOING
TO DO ANYTHING.
JUST STOP TALKING!
JUST STOP TALKING
AND LET ME THINK!
DAD, DO SOMETHING.
I GOT IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
I'M BEING CUTE AND SPONTANEOUS?
DON'T DO IT.
I WASN'T GOING TO.
YEP, THIS IS
A GOOD DINNER.
YES, NO, MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW
CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS
OF ME NOW
YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF ME NOW
YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF ME NOW
AND YOU'RE NOT SO BIG
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS
OF ME NOW
YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF ME NOW
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS
OF ME NOW
AND YOU'RE NOT SO BIG
LIFE IS UNFAIR.
MALCOLM.
YEAH?
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE,
PLEASE?
OOH.
TEACHER'S FAVORITE.
TEACHER'S PET.
"DEAR...PENTHOUSE..."
"YESTERDAY I PUSHED
MY FRIEND STEVIE
DOWN SOME STAIRS."
POINT... TAKEN...
WHAT?
MALCOLM, I'M
A LITTLE CONCERNED.
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL
IN YOUR STUDIES
BUT... I STILL SENSE
AN EMOTIONAL DISTANCE
BETWEEN US.
AND I HATE IT.
I'D REALLY LIKE US
TO TRY TO CONNECT
ON A DEEPER LEVEL.
WHOA. SHEIS
COMING ON TO ME.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DATING THE JANITOR.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
GOD. ONE DRINK AND...
NEVER MIND.
WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS
I KNOW YOUR PARENTS.
I KNOW YOU HAVE
A COLORFUL HOME LIFE.
SO, JUST REMEMBER IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYTHING AT ALL--
A SYMPATHETIC EAR,
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON--
I WANT YOU TO COME TO ME.
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I NEED-- ANOTHER MOM.
OKAY. GREAT.
THANKS A LOT.
WELL, I GOT TO GO
DO THE... THING.
AND THEN I DREW
A ROBOT, FRANCIS.
BUT MY CRAYON BROKE.
AND THEN I HAD
A POPSICLE.
I MEAN
I HAD 12 POPSICLES.
YOU LIKE POPSICLES,
FRANCIS?
SHUT UP, DEWEY.
STOP BUGGING FRANCIS.
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE
DEALING WITH THESE
LITTLE KIDS ALL DAY.
IT'S THE COOLEST THING.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME FRANCIS
IS HOME FROM MILITARY SCHOOL.
MOM AND DAD ARE GOING OFF
TO SOME WEDDING
AND FRANCIS IS IN CHARGE OF US
FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH
I MISSED HIM.
HEY.
HMPH.
HE'S SO GREAT.
BOYS! THE NUMBER FOR THE HOTEL
IS ON THE COUNTER.
I LEFT MONEY FOR PIZZA
BUT I WANT A RECEIPT
AND EXACT CHANGE.
YEP, THAT UNDERWEAR
IS GOING TO WRINKLE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND
OF NICE HAVING FRANCIS
BACK IN THE HOUSE,
DON'T YOU THINK?
WHAT?
NOTHING. YOU'RE JUST CUTE
WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING SUBTLE.
REALLY?
OF COURSE IT'S NICE
HAVING FRANCIS HOME.
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A FEW MONTHS NOW.
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO, YOU KNOW,
THINK ABOUT IT.
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
WE'LL SEE HOW HE
DOES THIS WEEKEND.
GOD, I HATE THIS HAIRDO.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHER
TRYING TO IMPRESS
YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.
THEY'VE ALWAYS HATED ME.
WELL, YOU ARE
THE ONE WHO STOLE
THEIR LITTLE HALLY
AWAY FROM THEM.
BETTER GET MOVING.
AND THEN IT GOT AWAY.
BUT I FOUND ANOTHER ONE,
BUT IT DIED.
AND THEN...
I SAID LEAVE HIM
ALONE, YOU BUTT-MUNCH.
LET ME GO.
MAKE ME.
GUYS,
QUIT IT.
LISTEN FOR A SECOND.
I JUST HEARD MOM AND DAD.
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT
LETTING FRANCIS COME HOME.
YOU SERIOUS?
YEAH. THEY WANT TO SEE
HOW HE DOES WITH US
THIS WEEKEND.
OKAY? SO WE
CAN'T SCREW UP.
COOL.
LET'S GO TELL HIM.
NO.
YOU KNOW HOW FRANCIS GETS WHEN
PEOPLE TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.
I AM WARNING YOU.
IF YOU GET YOUR
NOSE PIERCED,
YOU ARE GOING
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.
AND I MEAN IT. REALLY.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
HEY, MOM.
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
RIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE'RE GOING TO BE GOOD,
THAT'S WHAT.
HOW DO WE BE GOOD?
I DON'T KNOW.
HONESTLY, IT'S NEVER
COME UP BEFORE.
LOOK, WE'RE JUST NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING.
THAT WAY, WE CAN'T
GET IN ANY TROUBLE.
Hal:
HONEY.
WE'RE LATE.
WE BETTER HIT THE ROAD.
FINE. I'LL SHAVE
MY LEGS IN THE CAR.
OKAY.
I'VE MARKED THE
LIQUOR BOTTLES
AND WE CAN TASTE WHEN
THEY'RE WATERED DOWN.
I'VE LOCKED OUT
THE SMUT CHANNEL,
COUNTED YOUR
FATHER'S CIGARS.
I'VE CHECKED THE ODOMETER
ON THE CAR
AND THE BALANCE
ON THE CREDIT CARDS.
WE LOVE YOU,
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
AND JUST REMEMBER,
DEWEY WILL TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU DID
WHILE WE'RE GONE.
UH, WHAT YOUR
MOTHER SAID, BOYS.
MINUS ONE.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT WHAT?
SHE'S BLUFFING.
OKAY, I AM GOING
TO SHOW YOU GUYS
THE COOLEST THING
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
GET ME SOME
LIGHTER FLUID
A WAFFLE IRON AND ONE OF
DEWEY'S STUFFED ANIMALS.
THE FURRIER, THE BETTER.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE
KIND OF TIRED.
TIRED?
YEAH. TIRED.
I'M NOT TIRED.
OKAY, YEAH, I'M TIRED.
LET'S JUST GO
WATCH TV.
WHATEVER.
THIS PLAN BETTER WORK.
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN NO TV
IS GOLF ON TV.
OH, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.
LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.
NO. THEY'RE ONLY
ON THE SIXTH HOLE.
THEY'RE ONLY ON THE SIXTH HOLE.
HELLO.
FRANCIS, BUD, I HEARD YOU
WERE IN TOWN.
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?
SAME OLD,
SAME OLD, MAN.
OH, CIRCUS SAYS HI.
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE IT.
I FINALLY MOVED OUT.
I'M LIVING IN THE
BASEMENT NOW.
TOTAL FREEDOM, DUDE.
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!
MOM, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KNOCK.
DUDE, WE'RE COMING OVER.
OKAY. HEY, RICHIE AND THE GUYS
ARE COMING OVER.
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T.
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
ARE GONE.
OKAY, GOT IT.
RICHIE, LISTEN TO ME.
I'm watching my brothers,
so we got to hang here.
AND NO PARTIES OKAY?
I'M SERIOUS.
IT'S GOT TO BE
JUST THE THREE OF YOU.
HUH. YOU WOULDN'T THINK
ONLY THREE GUYS
COULD DO SO MUCH DAMAGE.
CALL US NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN TOWN.
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!
SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT
AFTERNOON DELIGHT...
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SEDUCE ME?
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
GOING TO THIS WEDDING.
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.
OH, COME ON, I PROMISE
IT'LL BE FUN.
HAL, I'M NOT DEWEY.
SORRY. BUT STILL,
WE'RE ALONE,
WE'RE AWAY FROM THE KIDS.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST
TWO UNENCUMBERED
CONSENTING ADULTS.
I SAY WE ENJOY IT.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WILL BE NICE TO HAVE SOME
TIME FOR JUST THE TWO OF US.
AND I'M GOING TO LOVE
NOT HAVING
TO YELL AT SOMEBODY
EVERY 20 SECONDS.
EITHER SPEED UP OR GET
OFF THE ROAD, JACKASS!
ABSOLUTELY DESERVED IT.
:
I HATE THOSE GUYS.
DID YOU SEE CIRCUS BREAK THAT
CINDER BLOCK WITH HIS HEAD?
THAT'S A GOOD LESSON
FOR YOU GUYS.
IT DIDN'T BREAK
THE FIRST SIX TIMES.
BUT DID HE QUIT TRYING?
NO, SIR.
FRANCIS, WE HAVE
TO CLEAN THIS UP.
YEAH.
NO. I MEAN NOW.
IF MOM AND DAD SEE THIS
THEY'LL FREAK.
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
THEY ALWAYS FREAK.
I'M USED TO IT.
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP.
WHAT'S WITH YOU GUYS?
I'M IN CHARGE HERE.
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'LL
GET IN TROUBLE. RELAX.
BUT WE WANT YOU TO COME HOME.
WHAT?
I HEARD MOM AND DAD TALKING.
THIS WEEKEND IS LIKE
A TEST FOR YOU, OR A TRAP.
IF YOU DO GOOD,
THEY MAY LET YOU COME HOME.
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEY'RE GONNA TOSS YOUR BUTT
BACK INTO MILITARY SCHOOL.
OKAY, LOOK...
FRANCIS,
IT SUCKS AROUND HERE
WITHOUT YOU.
CAN'T YOU JUST TRY
FOR OUR SAKE?
LOOK, GUYS, I APPRECIATE
YOUR SENTIMENT.
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO DECIDE MY WHOLE FUTURE
BASED ON HOW I BEHAVE
OVER ONE WEEKEND
WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ME
ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOO ARBITRARY.
IT'S UNREASONABLE.
IT'S MOM.
OKAY, LET'S CLEAN UP.
I'M NOT DONE
AND I WON'T BE
TILL MY HEAD FALLS OFF
IT'S PERFECT.
THE HOUSE HAS NEVER
BEEN THIS CLEAN.
UH-OH.
WHAT?
IT'S TOO CLEAN.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY'LL NEVER BUY IT.
I'M NOT DONE
AND I WON'T BE
TILL MY HEAD FALLS OFF
THOUGH THAT MAY NOT BE
A LONG WAY OFF
I WON'T BE DONE
UNTIL MY HEAD
FALLS OFF
AH. LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO GAVE THEM POT HOLDERS.
HI.
HI.
IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU.
YOU, TOO.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK IT'S BEEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
WELL, THAT WAS WORTH
DRIVING 600 MILES FOR.
WHO WAS THAT GUY?
IT'S THE GROOM, HAL.
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD WEAR
NAME TAGS AT THESE THINGS.
OH, PERFECT.
NICE TOUCH WITH THE
BREAD CRUMBS, DEWEY.
HUH?
I CLIPPED MY TOENAILS
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.
ATTABOY. SHE WILL
NEVER KNOW A THING.
WAIT.
TA-DA!
OW! OW! OW! OW!
MALCOLM!
MALCOLM, ARE YOU OKAY?
I THINK SO.
OW!!!
HOLD STILL.
COME HERE
AND LET ME SEE IT.
LET ME SEE IT.
HOW DOES IT LOOK?
NOT... TOO BAD.
PUT HIS FACE BACK ON!
OH, MAN, WHAT'S
THAT WHITE STUFF?
- IS THAT BONE?
- WHAT?!
GET ICE
AND SOME PAPER TOWELS.
WE HAVE
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IT.
OW! OW! OW!
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IT.
REESE, GIVE ME THE ICE!
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
WE'VE GOT THIS.
FINE. GIVE ME SOME ANTISEPTIC.
DON'T ANSWER THAT.
Dewey:
HELLO.
Lois:
Hi, Dewey.
HI, MOM.
WE'RE JUST CALLING TO CHECK IN.
LET ME SPEAK WITH FRANCIS.
HE'S...
IN THE BATHROOM.
WELL, LET ME TALK TO MALCOLM.
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM.
THEY'RE BOTH IN THE BATHROOM?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THERE?
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
WE HAVE TO GET YOU STITCHES.
LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
NO! YOU CAN'T.
MOM AND DAD
WILL FIND OUT.
MALCOLM,
THIS IS A HEAD INJURY.
YOU COULD HAVE A CONCUSSION.
CONCUSSION? I THINK
HE'S MAKING TOO MUCH OF THIS.
I'M NOT AS FIGGLED
AS HE HOOGERS.
NO!
I DON'T CARE.
I'M NOT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
THERE IS NO WAY THAT I...
GET THE CAR!
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
YOU WANT TO GET BLOOD
ALL OVER THE CAR?
WAIT! WE CAN'T TAKE THE CAR.
THEY'LL KNOW.
MOM CHECKED THE ODOMETER,
REMEMBER?
I'M ON TOP OF IT.
WHEE! HI, SCHOOL!
OH, MALCOLM, YOU
SHOULD SEE THIS!
FRANCIS IS
KICKING ASS!
I HATE THIS '80s CRAP.
ONE GOOD THING
ABOUT A HEAD INJURY:
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
I WON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.
OH, GREAT. A
ONE-WAY STREET.
HOW DOES THAT WORK IF
I'M GOING BACKWARDS?
AND ON THIS JOYOUS DAY
AS WE CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
OF TWO SOULS
JOINING INTO ONE...
DO YOU THINK THIS
IS GOING TO BE
ONE OF THOSE LONG SERVICES?
WHAT'S WRONG?
DID YOU KNOW
THAT YOUR FAMILY
HAS GIVEN ME A NICKNAME?
REALLY?
THAT'S NICE.
WHAT IS IT?
LOIS... COMMON... DENOMINATOR.
HEY, COME ON.
IT'S JUST THAT THEY'VE
NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE, YOU'RE
HONEST, AND, UH...
UNPRETENTIOUS.
DIRECT.
THEY'RE BAFFLED BY THAT.
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT GETS YOU, LOIS
AND, FRANKLY, I...
I LIKE THAT.
KIND OF MAKES YOU
MY SECRET TREASURE.
OH, HAL.
...BETWEEN
THE LORD AND US,
HIS SERVANTS, TWO PEOPLE
BROUGHT TOGETHER IN LOVE...
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
YOU KIDS AGAIN?
AND A HEAD INJURY.
YOU BOYS LIKE TO KEEP IT
INTERESTING, DON'T YOU?
WE KIND OF HAVE A HISTORY HERE.
I WAS IN
THE RIGHT PLACE
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE WRONG TIME
THOUGHT I SAID
THE RIGHT THING
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE WRONG LINE
I WAS IN THE RIGHT WORLD
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
WRONG, WRONG
LOOK, DOC, UH,
ABOUT THE BILL...
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL SEND IT
TO YOUR PARENTS.
YEAH, WELL...
WE WERE KIND OF THINKING
WE'D PAY FOR IT NOW.
OKEYDOKEY, BUT IT'S PROBABLY
GOING TO BE ABOUT $400.
WHAT?!
$400?
DON'T YOU HAVE
A FREQUENT CUSTOMER DISCOUNT
LIKE AT THE CAR WASH?
OR MAYBE WE COULD WORK IT OFF.
WE COULD EMPTY BEDPANS,
OR WASH CADAVERS.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT NEARLY AS COOL
AS IT SOUNDS.
SORRY.
WELL, WE'RE SCREWED.
COME ON, THERE'S
GOT TO BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO, SOMEONE
WE CAN CALL.
THERE'S NO ONE, MALCOLM.
ACTUALLY,
THERE MIGHT BE,
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF IT'S WORTH IT.
:
OH, MALCOLM!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
SORRY IT TOOK
ME SO LONG.
I WAS HAVING A CHARDONNAY
WHEN YOU CALLED
AND I HAD TO TAKE A CAB.
OH, GOD, I KNEW WE MADE
A DEEPER CONNECTION.
I JUST KNEW IT.
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
TO TURN AGAINST YOUR PARENTS,
BUT IN TIME YOU'LL SEE...
NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MY PARENTS DIDN'T DO THIS.
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT
AND THEY CAN'T FIND OUT
ABOUT IT.
WHAT?
IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED.
SEE, MY PARENTS ARE AWAY
AT A WEDDING
AND MY BROTHER IS HOME
FROM MILITARY SCHOOL
TO TAKE CARE OF US.
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
SHOULD BE PUNISHED JUST 'CAUSE
THEIR DAD USES CHEAP NAILS.
WE NEED $400, LADY.
WILL YOU LET ME TALK?!
WE NEED THE MONEY
FOR THE DOCTOR BILL
BECAUSE IF MY PARENTS FIND OUT
THAT I GOT HURT
THEN THEY'LL SEND FRANCIS AWAY,
AND WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE LOVE HIM.
MALCOLM, I CAN'T DO THAT.
BUT YOU SAID
IF I EVER NEEDED ANYTHING...
YES, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT EMOTIONAL STUFF.
I... DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT A TEACHER EARNS?
I HAVE $62 IN MY
CHECKING ACCOUNT.
THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS.
I'M SORRY.
I'M... I'M, I'M JUST SORRY.
WE CAN BREAK HER.
GUILT. GO FOR GUILT.
I GOT IT.
THAT'S OKAY.
THANKS, ANYWAY.
WELL, SQUIRT,
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE
GOING BACK TO MILITARY SCHOOL
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO SEE YOU FOR A REALLY,
REALLY LONG TIME.
BUT I NEED YOU
TO BE BRAVE.
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME,
SQUIRT?
STOP, FRANCIS!
I WISH I COULD,
KIDDO,
BUT I CAN'T.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I'M NOT DOING THIS, DEWEY.
IT'S JUST THE WAY LIFE IS
SOMETIMES.
PLEASE STOP CRYING.
IT HURTS!
I KNOW IT DOES.
IT HURTS ME, TOO.
WAIT! I'LL, I'LL DO IT.
I GUESS JAMAICA
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
WHERE IS MY CREDIT CARD?
IT FELL OUT
OF YOUR WALLET.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
LET'S GO.
PROCESSING IS
RIGHT OVER THERE.
RIGHT NEAR THE
VENDING MACHINES.
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHANGE?
THANK YOU.
WAY TO TAKE ONE
FOR THE TEAM, BUDDY.
WHEN WE GET HOME
YOU CAN EAT ICE CREAM
UNTIL YOU PUKE.
:
YAY.
HEY!OCUPADO!
HUH. WELL...
I DON'T SEE ANY HOLES
OR CRAPPY ATTEMPTS
TO PLASTER THEM UP.
BUT I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING.
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
UNDERNEATH THAT HAT?
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST WEARING...
YOU BOYS.
THAT'SIT?!
SO, YOU GUYS THINK
FRANCIS DID A GOOD JOB
TAKING CARE OF US, THEN?
OH, A GREAT JOB.
Lois:
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, FRANCIS,
WE WERE HAVING OUR DOUBTS
ABOUT THAT SCHOOL, BUT
IT'S REALLY MATURED YOU.
IN FACT, I THINK IT'S THE
BEST DECISION WE EVER MADE.
MOM: 62,437...
KIDS: ZERO.
SO, WE GET TO SEE FRANCIS AGAIN
IN A MONTH OR TWO.
I KNOW. IT SUCKS,
BUT WE GAVE IT A SHOT.
AND SCHOOL'S EASIER NOW
BECAUSE CAROLINE WON'T EVEN
MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ME ANYMORE
SO IT WASN'T A COMPLETE WASTE,
AND MOM ALWAYS SAYS
IT'S NOT A WASTED EXPERIENCE
IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING FROM IT
AND I DEFINITELY THINK I DID.
OKAY! READY!
