Yes, folks, Moderna Designs...
present the latest
in kitchen luxury.
The Moderna Wonder Major All-Automatic
Convenience Center-ette...
gives you all the time in the world
to do the things you really want to do.
An infrared
freezer/oven complex...
that can make you a meal
from packet to plate...
in 15 and a half seconds.
The Morrisons have got one that
can do that in eight seconds.
Block of ice to beef bourguignon
in eight seconds.
Lucky things.
Dad, did you know that
the ancient Greek warriors...
had to learn 44 different
ways of unarmed combat?
Well, at least we've got
a two-speed hedge cutter.
They were trying to kill people 26
different ways with their bare hands.
-
- Bedtime for you, Kevin. It's 9:00.
And this King Agamemnon,
he once fought...
Go on, dear.
Your father said.
- Oh, all right.
- The man you all love, Kenny Lange.
Well, that's today's top prize.
Let's meet today's star guest
on Your Money Or Your Life.
Bring them on, girls.
Oh, don't they look gorgeous?
Oh, they get lovelier
every day.
Turn that light off!
It is off.
What the hell
is going on up here?
I told you to put that light out
and get to bed.
- But...
- And no more noise!
It came off just like that.
The whole thermostat.
That's the toaster, the spreader
and the slicer all gone.
- She's in a terrible state.
- Should've bought German.
- Mom?
- It would've matched her rotissomat.
- Mom, Dad, can l...
- You're going to bed
in good time tonight.
- I was thinking of going to bed now.
- Now? Certainly not.
- You must wait for your food to go down.
- I haven't eaten any food.
Well, you must eat
your food.
And then wait for it
to go down.
Oh, no!
Not the carvery again.
Oh, dear me, Beryl.
Now, all I want to know...
is what famous film star
begins with "C"?
Do you understand
the question, my darling?
Come on, Beryl. Come on. Jumbo's
gonna end up in the souffle, Beryl.
You've got to answer it, Beryl.
Come on. Come on, Beryl.
- It's gone down now.
- Come on, Beryl. Come on.
- What?
- My supper. It's gone down.
I can feel it.
Can I go to bed now?
Yeah, all right.
Off you go. But no noise.
- What?
- No noise!
All right. Okay.
No, Beryl. Capetown is not a film star.
Oh, dear. Oh, well.
That's Your Money Or Your Life.
Well, it takes money.
With a kitchen like that?
Our kitchen's all right, isn't it?
Our kitchen is light-years behind.
- Where are we?
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the map.
- It's not on the map.
- Is he coming after us?
- I think we gave him the slip.
It's him!
Run for it!
- Which way?
- This way. Careful.
We can explain everything, sir.
It's not as bad as it looks.
We just borrowed the map.
Sort of got rather happy
about it, and, uh...
ran off in high spirits.
Yeah, we did.
Who are you?
That's not him.
It didn't sound
like him, did it?
It doesn't even
look like him.
- It isn't him.
- Let's get him!
Strutter, get his torch.
Shine it right in the face.
His face, dummy!
It's a kid!
Og, Fidgit,
check the door.
All clear.
Strutter, the light.
Just tell us how we get out of here,
keep quiet and you won't get hurt.
Wh-Why don't you get out
the way you came?
Don't try and be smart
with me, you little creep.
Yeah.
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.
He eats anything,
you know.
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.
- You know, don't you?
- I don't know anything.
You know, and you're
not going to tell us.
- I'm getting angry,
and Vermin's getting hungry.
- I don't know!
- He's found it!
- What?
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.
Come on, you lot, push!
Oh, no!
Not like that!
Wait for me to give
the order, all right?
Ready? One...
Stop! Stop!
You never start on one.
Who ever heard of anybody
starting anything on one?
- What is it then, two or three?
- Three.
-
- And push!
- It's him!
- He's found us!
Help us! Please!
Help us!
- Come on!
- Who is that?
Return what you
have stolen from me!
Return!
Return the map!
It will bring you
great danger!
Stop! Now!
- Where are we?
- I'm stuck!
Quick! The barn!
Get under here.
Hold him, Strutter.
Shut up!
All clear. Wally?
Yeah.
- Strutter?
- Yeah.
- Move it. Go.
- Okay.
- Fidgit?
- Yeah.
Where are we?
What happened to my bedroom?
Who was that man?
That was no man.
That was the Supreme Being.
You mean God?
We don't know him that well.
We only work for Him.
Shut up!
Now, are we all here?
- What?
- Og, are you here?
- Yeah, he's here.
- Vermin?
Vermin, will you stop eating!
It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get him! He'll give us away.
Help! Help!
Farmers!
Look what you've done, boy.
Sorry.
What town is that?
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.
- Napoleon?
- Yes. It's his city now.
Come on, boy.
You come with us.
No, thanks.
Come with us
if you know what's good for you.
You're going the wrong way.
Napoleon?
- Get down!
- You nearly got us caught!
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.
- Do you know where we are?
- Shut up. Of course I do.
Battle of Castiglione.
See?
Are you sure we're not
in somebody's bedroom?
Look, do you want to be
leader of this gang?
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.
Now, we've got to get
into the city.
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.
Come on!
Aaaah!
What are we
going to do here?
- A robbery.
- Shhh.
- A robbery?
- Of course.
We're international
criminals. We do robberies.
Shut up back there.
Aim! Fire!
Take aim! Fire!
That's him.
You're not gonna rob him?
Yeah. Every single
penny he's got.
- But that's Napoleon.
- And he's rich.
Monsieur Commander...
I think that the mayor of
Castiglione and his council...
would like very much
to surrender now, please.
Look at that!
Look at the little fellow!
With the city, we have the whole area
of western Lombardy at our feet.
Oh, go away!
I never should've
married you!
-
- Oh, stop it!
Yes! Yes!
Mon Commander,
they are very keen to surrender.
They have been here
eight hours.
Don't stand so close
to me, Neguy!
I've told you
about that before.
You on one side
and him on the other...
It's like being on the bottom
of a bloody well!
Just because
you think I'm small.
No, Commander, you are
not small at all.
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.
Yeah, five-foot-one
and conqueror of Italy.
- Not bad, huh?
- Very, very good.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What just happened?
Where'd they... I just...
Bravo!
More! I want more!
- l... Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore!
I wonder if you would like
to see some of our other items.
We have Zuzu and Benny.
Fun on a unicycle.
No?
How about
the Great Rumbozo?
He sing
and lift heavy things.
No. How about, uh...
Come on.
This I think you'll like.
It's very funny.
The Three Idiots...
uh, from Latvia.
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.
No, no!
They're all freaks!
Not one of them
under five-foot-six.
What kind of theater
are you running, huh?
I'm sorry, sir, but...
No, no.
More of the funny show,
the little puppets
hitting each other.
That's what I like!
Little things hitting each other!
Come on.
Psst.
- Huh?
- Play something like this.
Tsk. Hmm.
Like the wallpaper
sticks to the wall
Like the seashore
sticks to the sea
Like you never
get rid of your shadow
Boy, you didn't
get rid of me
Me
And my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Avenue, avenue, avenue
Me
And my shadow
- Not a soul to tell our troubles to
- Please let go!
- We stick together like glue
-
And when it's 12:00
We climb the stair
We never, never knock
'Cause nobody's there...
Me and my shadow
Feeling blue
Well, what do you think?
Marvelous show.
Young man, you stick with these boys,
you have a great future.
You know, you are
the best thing...
to happen to me
since this whole campaign.
You know, I come
to conquer Italy...
because I thought they
were all small, you know?
I heard they was
really tiny guys.
Sir, I really think there
are more important things...
Shut up!
Don't you dare to tell me
my business.
You are dismissed, you hear?
You, Lucien, the rest of you.
Great streaks of misery.
- But sir...
- No!
I'm going to have
some new generals for a bit.
Alexander the Great...
five feet exactly.
Isn't that incredible?
Alexander the Great, whose empire
stretched from India to Hungary...
One inch shorter than me.
Oliver Cromwell...
the only man with any guts
in British history...
Not a big man at all.
Louis IV, 5' 21/2".
Charlemagne...
a dumpy little five-footer.
-
- Squatty little chap.
Attila the Hun, 5' 11/2".
Cyrano de Bergerac,
Tamburlaine the Great,
four-foot-nine...
and three quarters.
Wasn't he interesting?
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.
According to this map, there's a time
hole outside. See if you can find it.
- Right.
- The rest of you, the hole
disappears at 12:00, right?
So let's get moving.
Vermin, Fidgit,
the tapestry.
Hey, that's 16th century!
It's nice, isn't it?
Get it!
Okay.
We're rich!
We're rich!
Ten-hut!
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
-
- Come on, Kevin.
Ten-hut!
About turn!
-  Stop!
- Go!
Thieves!
After them!
- Follow them!
-
Oh, Sir Vincent,
you came for me!
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.
Four horses have I exhausted
this day from Nottingham.
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber,
so full of... manliness.
I could scarce restrain
the rushing of my feet.
These 12 long years have been
like chains that bound me.
Oh. And the personal
problem?
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover,
and there embark for France.
Oh, you don't have
to wear the special...
No, no, I don't have to wear
the special... anymore.
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- No. No.
-
-
-
- Hey!
-
- Quick! Quick!
-  We did it!
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.
- We did it! We did it!
-
I told you. You stick with me,
and you won't go far wrong.
Sometimes I almost
believe you, Randall.
- Hey, where are we?
- Where are we?
Why, it's obvious.
We're, um...
Vincent, don't
worry about a thing.
I'm not worrying.
- Exactly...
- In the Middle Ages.
Hmm... in
the Middle Ages.
Five-hundred years before the man
we just robbed was even born.
- Fantastic!
- Try that one in a court of law.
Vermin, that is not
meant to be eaten.
You never know
until you've eaten it.
Is it always like this
when you've done a raid?
I don't know.
We've never done one before.
But I thought you were
international criminals.
Going to be.
Going to be.
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we? Going to be?
Especially now
that we've got you, Kevin.
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.
He knows an awful lot.
Yeah, and he's bigger
than any of us.
- Do you really want to join us?
- Can we really go anywhere?
You name it.
If it's down here.
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map?
This map used to belong
to the Supreme Being.
- You stole it?
- No. Well, sort of.
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,
like good and evil,
men and women, night and day.
And when He did trees and shrubs,
we helped make all this.
Whew, that's not bad.
Yeah, and did we get a thimble
full of credit for it?
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.
- Pink Bunkadoo?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.
- Og designed it, didn't you? Yeah.
-
Six-hundred feet high,
bright red and smelled terrible.
As a disciplinary measure, we were
sent down to the repairs department.
-
- What?
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric
of the universe is far from perfect.
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.
Well, why repair them?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich?
Yeah, stinkin' rich!
-
- Lads, here's to stinkin' rich!
Stinkin' rich.
Stinkin' rich.
- And to Kevin!
- Yeah, Kevin!
- Here's to Kevin!
- Stinkin' Kevin!
Hey, hold it there.
-
- Smile.
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.
Hey, come on! Smile!
Help! Robbers!
- Hey, that's us!
- Someone's in trouble. Come on!
Grab the loot.
-
- It's a bit tight.
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah!
Vincent! Oh!
Oh, dear!
-  Help!
- Come on.
Oh, Vincent,
someone's coming.
-
- Help! Help I say!
Oh, at last.
Oh, I say!
I say, my fiance and I would appreciate
a bit of assistance.
- Oh, no! The problem, Pansy!
- Oh! Oh!
- It's started again! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, don't worry, darling.
- I say!
- I must have fruit!
- Where are we?
- We've lost them.
Come on.
Don't be so wet.
-
-  Hey!
What do we do now,
Randall?
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.
What do you want,
you tatty-faced old scumbag?
- What's your business, gob face?
- We're robbers!
- Villainous robbers?
- The worst.
- Stop at nothing?
- Nothing at all.
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands?
- Rather.
- The teeth from blind old ladies?
- Of course.
- Toys from children?
- Whenever we can.
Right.
Let 'em down!
They always crack
in the end.
Wow.
Listen, I've got a few ideas
for, uh, a linkup...
between your gang
and our gang,
but I only want
to talk to the boss.
The boss?
- The boss?
- That's right.
They serious?
Ohhh.
All right! Do it!
Anyone else wanna go?
Come on, you weasels.
What's this?
Lose yourself, leprechaun.
Move yourself, lad.
- That's disgusting!
- Wait here! I'll get him!
Hello. I-I'm Hood.
- It's Robin Hood.
- Yeah.
-
- Say good morning, you scum.
Good morning, scum.
- Good morning.
You're all robbers, then?
- The best, Mr. Hood.
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you?
Jolly good.
And do you enjoy
robbing, then?
Well, it helps
pay the rent, sir.
Jolly good.
And you're a robber too?
How long have you been a robber?
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord!
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one?
- Yes.
Well, th-th-th-that is
a long time, isn't it?
Well now, I hear you've made
a pretty good haul.
Well, see for yourself, sir.
Gosh! I say!
Crikey! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years,
but I've never seen
anything like this.
Crumbs! And you acquired
all of this by yourselves?
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.
- Jolly good day!
- It's nice, isn't it?
Rather! Well, I mean,
what can I say? Thank you.
Thank you all
very, very much indeed.
Oh, don't ment... What?
Well, I mean,
it's frightfully kind of you.
The poor are going to be
absolutely thrilled.
- Have you met them?
- Who? The poor?
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.
Of course, they haven't
got two pennies to rub together.
- But that's because they're poor.
-
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind
as to ask the poor to come in, please?
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.
This is going to be
so much help in our work.
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the
poor are going to be not just thrilled,
but also considerably less poor,
aren't they, Redgrave?
-
- You see? What did he say?
- He said, "Yeah, what with
Christmas coming up and all."
- Ah, jolly good.
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well done.
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.
Is that... Is that
absolutely necessary?
-
- What did he say?
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.
Incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work?
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.
Oh, I'd like to stay.
Jolly good.
What's your name?
- Uh, Ke...
- Ke... What a jolly nice name.
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.
- Cheerio. Thank you very much.
-
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.
Awful people.
- This can't wait!
- I'll never get a chance
to meet Robin Hood again.
- Any chance of a rescue?
- Stop moaning!
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.
Giving away
what isn't even his!
That's what Robin Hood
always did. Even I know that.
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.
Heroes! Heroes!
What do they know about a day's work?
- Leave him alone, Randall!
- Well, it makes me sick.
Anyone who's always right
makes me sick.
- That's why you get on with yourself!
- Watch it!
- Big mouth!
- Horseflesh wouldn't
have got us into this.
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map.
I'm taking over!
Get off me! Get...
So... these are
the sort of people...
the Supreme Being
allows to steal His map?
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.
I wouldn't entrust them
to wipe their own noses.
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff?
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent?
But He created you,
Evil One.
What did you say?
Well, He created you,
so He can't be totally...
Never talk to me
like that again!
No one created me!
I am Evil!
Evil existed
long before good.
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.
I am all-powerful!
Yeah.
But why,
if that's the case,
are you unable to escape
from this fortress?
That's a good question.
Why have I let the Supreme Being
keep me here...
in the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?
- Because you...
- Oh, shut up.
I'm speaking rhetorically.
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here...
in order to lull Him
into a false sense of security.
Ah, clever, clever.
When I have the map,
I will be free...
and the world will be different
because I have understanding.
- Uh, understanding of what, master?
- Of digital watches.
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.
God isn't interested
in technology.
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots!
- Nipples for men!
- Slugs.
Slugs! He created slugs.
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic?
Sir... look!
If I were creating a world,
I wouldn't mess about
with butterflies and daffodils.
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.
-
- Sorry.
I just can't wait for a new tech...
techno... technological dawn.
Sir... look!
What is it, Benson?
The map, sir. The map!
They've brought it with them!
- What?
- I saw the map, master, just now.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, master.
Down there!
The little one has it.
The little one?
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for!
- It will set us free.
- Shut up!
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...
and pull them in.
Stand by for mind control.
What about Babylon?
- Who?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.
Ahh.
I've got a better idea.
Who said that?
I've got an idea
forming in my head.
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.
What the hell
are you talking about?
The most fabulous
object in the world.
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.
-  Why do you always
have to go after money?
- Who's this?
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he?
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them!
Randall, look, over there!
- We'd better move!
-  Don't rush me.
The forest!
It's on fire!
It's raining,
pudding head!
- Oh, no!
- What is it?
- It's Him!
- It's Him!
Return the map.
- Make for the hole!
- Where is it?
It's over there.
Quick! Come on!
- Stop! Return!
- Hurry up!
Return what you
have stolen from me.
Return the map!
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one? Which one?
Go, Kevin!
Just get away!
Go! Not that one!
Where did you
come from? Huh?
I'm not quite sure.
Who sent you?
The gods?
Was it Zeus?
Apollo?
Athena?
Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you?
I don't believe it!
You don't believe what?
I don't believe
the way you killed him.
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.
I bet you've killed
lots of people.
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.
Oh, yeah. Kevin.
Kevin?
Well, Kevin,
here, it's yours.
- What?
- You don't want it?
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it?
Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.
Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.
You see, if I lose them,
I may never be able to get back.
-
- Get back? To where?
I'm not really sure.
Here, you better take this.
You'll need it. It's water.
There's enough there for your friends,
too, if they ever turn up.
Oh, and by the way,
thank you.
No. Please.
I'd like to come, really.
No, no, please.
I'd like to come.
Better? No.
-
-
You saved my life.
Remember?
The enemy of the people
is dead!
Hail King Agamemnon!
There's a man being
cut in half here.
It must have been a brilliant battle.
Choo! Choo!
All three are to receive
summary executions today.
If the queen wishes to see me,
I'll be in the courts all afternoon.
Remind the queen that
I still rule this city.
I wish I'd been
in the Trojan Wars.
Will you teach me
how to sword fight?
Come here. I'll teach you
something much more useful.
- Where is it?
- There.
That one.
Kings aren't supposed
to do things like that.
You know, I never, ever
want to go back.
Don't you want to see
all your friends again?
No, thanks.
To be in your own home, to be
with your own father and mother?
No.
Very well, then.
- I can stay?
- We'll decide that tomorrow.
I have decreed that this boy
shall remain here with us in our city.
Furthermore, he shall
from this day forward be my own son...
and heir to the throne
of Mycenae.
Let the banquet begin.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a mastery miracle of modern
magic before your very eyes.
Abracadee, abracadoo!

- You're doing a great job.
If we can borrow this
for a moment, sir.
Please give generously
as my assistants pass amongst you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Come on. Come on.
- Now all we need is a volunteer.
Yes, young man, you'll do fine.
- No! Please!
