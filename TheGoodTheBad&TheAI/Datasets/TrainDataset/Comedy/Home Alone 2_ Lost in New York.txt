BUZZ: Rod, do they have
nude beaches in Florida?
GlRL: Where are my magazines?
FRANK: Leslie!
Leslie, what'd you do
with my golf balls?
BUZZ:
Fifteen and a half sunblock.
BUZZ:
Fifteen and a half sunblock.
TRACY: Could I get
a string bikini in Florida?
LESLlE: Pack your beach towel.
BUZZ: Nobody can order pizza
in this house.
FRANK: Where are my golf balls?
BUZZ: You know why? 'Cause I'm
the only guy who likes pizza.
TRACY:
Has anybody seen my sunblock?
What's the point
of going to Florida...
if you're gonna put on
sunblock?
I don't care if I age
like an old suitcase.
-I'm getting toasted.
-Great.
Now you can be a skag
with slightly darker skin.
He's jealous
'cause he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.
FRANK:
Hey, easy on the fluids, pal.
The rubber sheets are packed.
BOB EUBANKS ON TV:
Vicky goes with Ding.
Behind Ding is 200 points.
All right. Good for you.
RECORDlNG:
Two hundred points. All right.
KATE: Honey, are you packed yet?
KEVlN: Yes.
RECORDlNG: Yes.
Everything I put out for you?
Yes.
RECORDlNG: Yes.
You see what Grandma Penelope
sent you for the trip?
Uh, let me guess.
Donald Duck slippers?
Ah ha! Close.
An inflatable clown
to play with in the pool.
How exciting.
Why are we going to Florida?
There's
no Christmas trees there.
What is it
with you and Christmas trees?
How can we have Christmas
without a Christmas tree?
We'll find a nice, fake
silver one...
or decorate a palm tree.
BOB EUBANKS:
Good-bye, everybody.
Guests of The New
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong...

PETER: Know where the battery
for this camcorder is?
KATE: Yeah,
I put it in the charger.
PETER: How's this?
KATE: Oh, much better.
PETER: Kevin,
you better put your tie on.
We don't want to be late
for the Christmas pageant.
My tie's in the bathroom.
I can't go in there.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.
He says if I saw him naked...
I'd grow up
never feeling like a real man.
Whatever that means.
PETER: I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in there,
get your tie, get out...
and don't look at anything.
FRANK SlNGlNG HORRlBLY:
Well
This cat they're talking about
I wonderwho could it be
'Cause they know
I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat
you ever did see
Women see me
walking down the street
None of the fellas want to speak
Oh hey hey, on their faces
They wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know I'm the king
Of the cool
Jerk
RADlO: Ooh
FRANK: Get out of here,
you nosy little pervert...
or I'll slap you silly!
Oh, you're cooking, Frankie!
Christmas tree
My Christmas tree
Lit up like a star
When I see my Christmas tree
Can loved ones be far?
Christmas tree, I'm certain
Wherever I roam
KATE: Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Leslie.
PETER: Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Frank.
LESLlE: Frank, Kev--Frank.
FRANK: Huh?
KEVlN:
Christmastime means laughter
Toboggans in the snow
Caroling to children
With faces aglow
Stockings on the mantel
A wreath on the door
And my merriest Christmas
Needs just one thing more
BOY SlNGlNG: Christmas tree,
my Christmas tree
Lit up like--
Oh!
Oh!
FRANK: Ha ha ha!
Kevin!
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...
I'd like to apologize
to my family...
for whatever displeasure
I might have caused you.
KEVlN: What?
My prank
was immature and ill-timed.
FRANK: lmmature or not...
it was pretty
gol-dern hilarious.
I'd also like to apologize
to my brother.
Kevin, I'm sorry.
KATE:
Oh, Buzz, that was very nice.
Kevin, do you have
something to say?
Beat that,
you little trout sniffer.
I'm not sorry!
Buzz humiliated me.
He gets away with everything,
so I let him have it.
And since you're so stupid
to believe him...
I don't care if your idiotic
Florida trip gets wrecked.
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate anyway?
KATE: Kevin!
PETER: You walk out,
you sleep on the third floor.
Yeah, with me.
What else is new?
FRANK: You'd better not wreck
my trip, you little sourpuss.
Your dad's
paying good money for it.
I wouldn't want to spoil
your fun, Mr. Cheapskate.
What a troubled young man.
They're all a bunch of jerks.
KATE: Hi.
Last time
we tried to take a trip...
we had a problem
that started just like this.
KEVlN: Yeah,
with me getting crapped on.
KATE: I don't care
for your choice of words.
That's not what happened
last time or this time.
Buzz apologized to you.
Yeah, then he called me
a trout sniffer.
He didn't mean what he said.
He was just sucking up to you.
OK. Sit here for a while
and think things over.
When you're ready to apologize
to Buzz and everyone else...
you can come down.
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat.
Then you can stay here
the rest of the night.
Fine.
I don't wanna be down there.
I can't trust anybody
in this family.
If I had my own money...
I'd go on my own vacation,
alone, without any of you guys.
I'd have the most fun
in my life.
You got your wish last year.
Maybe you'll get it again.
I hope so.
BOTH: We did it again!
Aah!
KATE: Our McCallisters
in the first van...
the other McCallisters
in the second van.
FRANK: I know
I shouldn't complain...
but you guys give
the worst wake-up calls.
KATE: Do you have the tickets?
LESLlE: I've got them.
Here's your family's.
KATE: How many do you have?
-Seven.
-Seven?
-Fourteen.
-Fourteen.
KATE: Seven...
eight, nine, ten.
MEGAN: How come we aren't
sitting together?
KATE: We're lucky
to get on the same plane.
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...
Where's Kevin?
KEVlN: Fourteen.
It's a good thing
I have my own ticket...
in case
you guys try to ditch me.
PETER: Come on, Kevin.
KEVlN: Dad, I need batteries.
PETER: They're in my bag.
Wait till we're on the plane.
KEVlN: Why can't I get them now?
I can get them.
PETER: What's the gate number?
Eight-seventeen, sir.
Hurry up.
It's the last gate.
KEVlN: Wow.
PETER: Eight-seventeen, Buzz!
Come on, Kevin.
Kevin, you going to take my bag?
You going to take my bag?
Come on.
PETER:
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
P.A.: American Airlines

Come on, come on.
Dad, wait up!
Dad, wait up!
Wait up!
Wait!
BUZZ: Look out! Look out!
KATE: Come on, come on!
KEVlN: Dad, wait!
KATE: Here we are. Here.
PETER: Everybody here?
We made it? All right.
The plane is ready to leave.
KATE: Let me just make sure
everyone gets on.
Don't worry.
We'll make sure.
WOMAN: Merry Christmas.
Have a nice flight.
-Merry Christmas.
-Bye-bye.
Hey, wait up!
Hey, guys, wait for me!
-Cutting it kind of close.
-Yeah, sorry.
ATTENDANT: Merry Christmas.
Dad, wait up!
Wait!
KEVlN: I'm sorry.
ATTENDANT: That's all right.
Are you on this flight?
KEVlN: Yeah, so is my family.
They're already on the plane.
I don't want to be left behind.
-Do you have a boarding pass?
-It's somewhere.
SUPERVlSOR: We have to close up.
ATTENDANT:
He dropped his boarding pass.
KEVlN: This plane can't leave.
This happened to me last year.
Are you sure
your family's on this flight?
KEVlN: Yeah. My dad ran in here
before I bumped into her.
OK, board him...
but make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.
ATTENDANT:
Do you see your family?
KEVlN:
There's my dad over there.
ATTENDANT: OK. Find a seat.
-Have a merry Christmas.
-You, too.
STEWARDESS: In order
for the captain to push back...
we need all passengers
to be seated...
with their seat belts
securely fastened.
KEVlN: So, have you ever
been to Florida?
STEWARDESS: Welcome aboard
American Airlines flight 176...
nonstop to New York...
TOM PETTY SlNGlNG:
Oh, baby, it's Christmas
All over
Again...
PETER: I didn't think
we were going to make it.
Something wrong?
Honey?
I have that feeling.
We forgot something?
No, I don't thinkwe did,
but l...
I just have that feeling.
Bad memories, that's all.
We did everything,
we brought everything...
we have everybody.
There's nothing to worry about.
KATE: Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.
PETER: Nothing to worry about.
KEVlN: Mom?
Dad?
Uncle Frank?
Buzz?
STEWARDESS: We're the last ones
off the plane.
Where are those guys?
-Whose is this?
-That's Brooke's.
PETER: This is Megan's.
Brooke. Give this to Brooke.
Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.
Give this to Kevin.
-Give this to Kevin.
-Kevin.

Excuse me,
but this is an emergency.
Yes, sir?
What city is that over there?
That's New York, sir.
Yikes, I did it again.
Something wrong, sir?
I'll be fine.
Oh, no.
My family's in Florida,
and I'm in New York.
My family's in Florida...
I'm in New York?
DARLENE LOVE SlNGlNG:
The cold wind is blowin'
And the streets are gettin' dark
I'm writing you a letter
And I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringing
At St. John the Divine
I get a little lonely
Every year 'round this time
The music plays all night
In Little ltaly
The lights will be going up
On old Rockefeller Tree
People window shoppin'
on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you
I've gotta know
Where all the lonely hearts go
'Cause nobody oughta be
Alone on Christmas
I've gotta know
Oh
What's the child's name?
BOTH: Kevin.
KATE: K-E-V-l-N.
OFFlCER:
When did you see him last?
KATE: Curbside check-in?
PETER: I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.
OFFlCER: Most people get
separated at security checks.
Did everyone
get through security?
KATE: I don't know. Peter?
PETER: We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.
When did you notice
he was missing?
KATE: When we picked up
our baggage here.
OFFlCER: Has the boy ever
run away from home?
BOTH: No.
Has he ever been on his own?
PETER: Mmm.
KATE: As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.
It's becoming sort of a family
travel tradition.
PETER: Funnily enough,
we never lose our luggage.
KATE: He was left at home
by accident last year.
PETER: Yeah,
that's what my wife meant...
when she said
it's a family travel tradition.
We'll call Chicago and, uh...
notify them of the situation.
The odds are that's where he is.
PETER: Thanks.
It's very unlikely
he'd be anywhere else.
TRUCK DRlVER: Watch out, kid!
MAN: Yo, where's your manifest?
HARRY: Here we are, Marv.
New York City,
the land of opportunity.
Smell that?
MARV: Yeah.
You know what that is?
Fish.
It's freedom.
No, it's fish.
It's freedom, and it's money.
OK, OK. It's freedom.
Let's get out of here
before somebody sees us.
And it's fish.
HARRY: Yup, one quick score.
We get ourselves a couple
of phony passports...
we hightail it
to some foreign country.
MARV: Arizona?
That's very smart, Marv.
You bust out of jail to rob
fourteen cents from Santa Claus?
Every little bit helps.
Besides,
now we got our new nickname.
We're the Sticky Bandits.
Real cute.
-Very cute.
-Huh?
KEVlN: The Plaza Hotel...
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.
Sick.
MARV: What's the matter?
HARRY: Thought I saw something.
Pardonnez-moi, mon cherie.
WOMAN: Hmm.
HARRY: Serves you right.
Come on, let's go!
MARV: I think she likes me.
Ahh.
Excuse me. Where's the lobby?
Down the hall and to the left.
Thanks.
Wow!

KEVlN: Howdy-do. This is
Peter McCallister, the father.
I'd like a hotel room, please...
with an extra-large bed, a TV...
and one of those
little refrigerators...
you have to open with a key.
Credit card? You got it.
Plaza hotel reservations.
May I help you?
RECORDlNG:
Howdy-do.
This is Peter McCallister,

I'd like a hotel room, please...
with an extra-large bed, a TV...

Sir, you'll need a major
credit card upon check-in.
RECORDlNG:
Credit card? You got it.
WOMAN:
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.
CONClERGE: Yes, two at 8:00,
Henri--Mr. Yamamoto.
Hold on a second.
I'll call you back, Henri.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Reservation for McCallister?
A reservation for yourself?
Ma'am, my feet are hardly
touching the ground.
I'm barely able
to look over this counter.
How could I make
a hotel reservation?
Think about it--
a kid going into a hotel,
making a reservation?
I don't think so.
I'm confused.
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business.
He's at a meeting.
I hate meetings...
plus I'm not allowed to go in.
I can only sit in the lobby.
That's boring...
so my dad dropped me off here.
He gave me his credit card...
and said whoever
was checking people in...
to let me in the hotel room...
so I won't get into mischief...
and, ma'am, sometimes I do
get into mischief.
We all do!
OFFlCER: Merry Christmas.
No sign of him.
We'll have to be able
to get ahold of you.
-You have hotel arrangements?
-Yeah.
Do you have
a recent photo of the boy?
PETER: I have one in my wallet.
I don't have my wallet.
My wallet's in my bag.
Kevin was looking in my bag
at the airport.
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.
Did you have credit cards
in the wallet?
Credit cards, money.
We'll notify
the credit card companies.
If your son has the cards...
we can get a location on him
when and if he uses them.
I don't think Kevin even knows
how to use a credit card.
Wow! It worked.
-Cedric.
-Yes?
Don't count your tips
in public...
and find out everything you can
about that young fellow.
WOMAN: Front, please.
Enjoy your stay with us.
Don't forget to remind your dad
when he arrives...
that he has to come down
and sign a couple of things.
KEVlN: Thank you.
You've been most helpful.
CEDRlC:
May I take your bag, sir?
CEDRlC: Up here to your left.
You know, Herbert Hoover
once stayed here on this floor.
KEVlN: The vacuum guy?
CEDRlC: No, the, uh, president.
This is one of our
finest suites, sir.
This is great!
KEVlN:
Wow! A huge bed just for me!
Luxurious...
and spacious.
How convenient!
Hey!
Did you want me
to put the key in the bag...
or did you just want
to hang on to it?
I'll hang on to it.
Is everything all right, sir?
Is the temperature
in the room OK?
It's OK.
Do you know how the TV works?
I'm ten years old. TV's my life.
Well...
Oh, I'm sorry.
And there's plenty more
where that came from.
CEDRlC: Thank you.

Two scoops, sir?
Two? Make it three.
I'm not driving.
WOMAN ON TV:
It's gardenias, Johnny...
your favorite.
You was here last night, too,

I was singin'

She was not! She was smooching

You got to do betterthan that!
If my love was an ocean...
Lindy'd have to take
two airplanes to get across it!
Maybe I'm off my hinges,
but I believe you.
-Oh!
-That's why I'll let you go.
I'm going to give you

Guide me home for Christmas day
Your drawers, sir.
Jeez! Don't flash

There could be girls
on this floor!
I was very careful, sir.
You can't be too careful
when it involves underwear.
I understand.
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.
No tip? OK.
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
MAN:
How do I get to Columbus Circle?
CONClERGE: The doorman will be

Uh...excuse me.
MAN: Sure.
And how are we this morning?
Fine.
Is my transportation here?
Out in front, sir.
A limousine and a pizza...
compliments of the Plaza Hotel.
I do hope your father
understands...
that last night I was simply
checking the room...
to make sure
everything was in order.
Oh, he was pretty mad.
He was?
He said he didn't come
to New York...
to get his naked rear end
spied on.
Of course not.
Will he be down...soon?
He already left.
Oh. I would have liked...
to have offered
my personal apology.
If some guy looked at you
in the shower...
would you ever want
to see him again?
I suppose not.
I don't think you'll see him
for the rest of our trip.
I understand.
Bye.
Have a lovely day.

JOHNNY MATHlS SlNGlNG:
It's beginning to look a lot
Iike Christmas
CEDRlC: Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own...
cheese pizza.
JOHNNY MATHlS SlNGlNG:
Take a look in the five and ten
Listening once again
With candy canes
and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
KEVlN: Hello?
DRlVER: Hello.
Know any good toy stores?
Yes, sir!
BACKGROUND SlNGERS:
It's beginning to look a lot
Iike Christmas
Soon the bells will start
JOHNNY MATHlS: And the thing
that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
CONClERGE: Bingo!
HARRY: Get out of here!
Go on! Get out of here!
Beat it! Get out of here!
Hey...Marv!
Get over here!
I got to talk to you!
MARV: Whoa! Whoa!
Would you like a scarf?
Forget the scarf, Marv.
We got to talk.
We don't have the equipment
to pull off anything big--
you know, your banks,
jewelry stores.
We don't want goods.
We need cash,
and we need it now.
MARV: How about, uh...
hotels?
Tourists carry lots of cash.
There's no guarantees.
I got a better idea.
Stores don't deposit cash
on Christmas Eve.
The only stores
that'll have cash on hand...
are ones that deal
in moderate-priced goods.
MARV: Right...right.
HARRY: What stores make
lots of cash Christmas Eve...
that nobody's going to think
to rob?
Candy stores.
Nine-year-olds
rob candy stores, Marv.
This is what I had in mind.
MARV: That's brilliant, Harry.
Brilliant!
HARRY: Yep.
There's nobody dumb enough...
to knock off a toy store
on Christmas Eve.
Oh, yes, there is.
DRlVER: Here we are, sir...
Duncan's Toy Chest.
Merry Christmas, Kevin.
This is the greatest accident
of my life.
Marv. Marv!
Hey, nice house,
but there's no bathroom in it.
MARV: What's the plan?
HARRY: Everybody leaves
for a nice holiday off.
We come out
of our little houses...
Yeah, then what?
We empty the registers and
walk out like we own the joint.
Great plan, Harry!
MAN: Shake his hand.
CASHlER: Well, now thank you
and merry Christmas.
Say hello to the family.
Oh, yes. Let me see.
Eh...
You shopping alone?
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid
of my own shadow.
CASHlER: I was just checking.
KEVlN:
That's very responsible of you.
CASHlER: Oh, well, thank you.
KEVlN: My pleasure.
CASHlER: That'll be $23.75.
My, my, my!
Where did you get
all that money?
Uh...I have a lot
of grandmothers.
CASHlER: Oh.
Well, that explains it.
This is a really nice store--
one of the finer toy dealerships
I've ever visited.
CASHlER: Oh, well, thank you.
KEVlN: Mr. Duncan
must be a pretty nice guy...
Ietting all the kids
come into his store...
and play with his toys.
Most toy stores prohibit that.
-Oh, is that so?
-Yep.
Well, he loves kids.
As a matter of fact...
all the money
the store takes in today...
Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the Children's Hospital...
and the day after Christmas...
we empty all the money
in the cash register...
and Mr. Duncan just takes it
right down to the hospital.
That's very generous of him.
Well, children
bring him a lot of joy...
as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.
I'm not supposed to spend
this money...
but I have twenty dollars
from shoveling snow...
in a jar in our garage...
where my older brother
can't find it.
So I'll pay my mother back
with that.
You can give this
to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital
needs it more than I do.
Besides, I'll probably
spend it on stuff...
that'll rot my teeth
and my mind.
Aw...that's--
that's very sweet of you.
Eh...you see that tree there?
To show our appreciation
for your generosity...
I'm going to let you select
an object from that tree...
that you can take home with you.
-Free?
-Oh, yeah.
CASHlER: Eh...may--
may I make a suggestion?
KEVlN: OK.
CASHlER: Take the turtledoves.
I could have two?
Well, two turtledoves.
I'll tell you what you do.
You keep one...
and you give the other one
to a very special person.
You see...
turtledoves are a symbol
of friendship and love.
As long as each of you
have your turtledove...
you'll be friends forever.
Wow! I never knew that.
I thought they were
just part of a song.
They are...
and--and for that
very special reason.
Wow!
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Be sure to bundle up
if you go outside.
It's a little nippy.
Oh, thank you, l--I'll do that.
Well, where to?
You promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.
Hey!
Look who it is, Marv.
Come on. Let's get him.
WOMAN: Oh! Hey!
HARRY: Hiya, pal.
Aah!
Aah!
HARRY: Come on!
MAN: Hey!
MAN: Hey! Watch it, man!
VENDOR: Buy now and avoid
the Christmas rush.
Two forfive dollars,
fourforten.
All right.
MARV: There he is!
VENDOR: All right, kiddo!
-Thanks.
-Merry Christmas.
-Oh! Hey!
-Whoa!
MAN: Excuse me!
-Whoa!
-Whoa!
-Oh!
-Oh!
MARV: Ohh!
Yes!
WOMAN:
Thank you for your suggestion.
CONClERGE:
My duty and my pleasure.
KEVlN: You got to help me!
There's two guys after me!
What's the matter?
Store wouldn't take your...
stolen credit card?
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.
HARRY: Get up! Get up!
Come on! Let's go get him!
CONClERGE:
Get back here, you little thief!
Stop that child!
CEDRlC: Grab him!
CONClERGE: You little sh--
I've committed
credit card fraud.
CONClERGE: Get me security!
We've got to stop
that delinquent!
Come along, Cedric.
I've had enough
of this vacation.
I'm going home.
Hold it right there.
This is the concierge, sir!
I knew it was you.
I could smell you
getting off the elevator.
You was here last night, too,
wasn't you?
Yes, sir...I was.
JOHNNY: You was here...
and you was smooching
with my brother!
I'm--I'm afraid
you're mistaken, sir.
Don't give me that.
You been smooching
with everybody!
Snuffy, Al, Leo...
Iittle Mo with the gimpy leg...
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff.
No!
It's a lie!
JOHNNY:
I could go on forever, baby.
I'm terribly sorry, sir...
but I'm afraid
you're mistaken.
We're looking for a young man.
All right.
I believe you...
but my Tommy gun don't!
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.
CONClERGE: On your knees.
I love you!
You got to do betterthan that!
EVERYONE: I love you!
JOHNNY: Maybe I'm off my hinges,
but I believe you.
That's why
I'm going to let you go.
I'm going to give you
to the count of three...
to get your lousy,
lying, lowdown...
four-flushing carcass
out my door!
-One.
-Open up the door!
Two.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Three!
JOHNNY: Merry Christmas,
you filthy animal...
JOHNNY: and a happy New Year.
Stay in your rooms!
This is an emergency!
There's an insane guest
with a gun!
KEVlN: Nooo!
HARRY: Come to papa!
MARV: Ha! Round trip to Miami.
What's the matter?
Get on the wrong plane, squirt?
HARRY: Looks like
you won't be needing this, kid.
MARV: American don't fly to
the promised land, little buddy.
HARRY: Come on!
HARRY:
We spent nine months in jail...
thinking we had
the worst luck in the universe.
We were wrong, little buddy.
MARV: We busted out of
the clink, and we're doing fine.
We'll be doing even better...
because we're not
robbing houses anymore.
Now we're robbing toy stores.
At midnight tonight...
we're hitting
Duncan's Toy Chest.
Five floors of cash.
After that, we grab
a couple of phony passports--
HARRY: Marv!
Marv, you want to shut up?
MARV: What's the difference?
He's not going to talk
to anybody...
except maybe a fish.
Or the undertaker.
HARRY: Let's just get him
to the subway tunnel.
I'll feel a lot better
once we get him on ice.
HARRY:
I've got a gun in my pocket.
You open your mouth...
and you'll be spitting gum
out through your forehead.
Well, hello.
-He did it.
-Did what?
Thanks.
HARRY: Get him, will ya!
MARV: He went in the park.
HARRY: What are you doing?
Get up!
MARV: Overthere!
BOY: Quit it!
-Hey!
-Creep!
-Give it!
-What are you doing?
MARV: Hey, Harry, I got him.
HARRY:
Let me see. That ain't him.
Put him down. That ain't him.
We should've shot him
when we had the chance.
I hate pulling a job knowing
that creep is on the loose.
MARV: What can he do?
Kids are helpless.
HARRY: Not this kid.
MARV: This time,
he doesn't have a houseful...
of dangerous goodies
to get us with.
He's in the park. He's alone.
Kids are a-scared of the park.
HARRY: Yeah.
Grown men come in the park...
and don't leave alive.
MARV: Yeah.
HARRY: Good luck, little fella.
KEVlN: I want to go home.
Mom, where are you?
Turn that down.
-Hello.
-Kate McCallister, please.
-This is she.
-Ma'am, we found your son.
-What?
-The police know where Kevin is.
MAN: He's in New York City.
He's in New York.
-New York?
-New York?
MAN: He checked into the Plaza
with your husband's credit card.
I'm sure he was scared.
He's not a troublemaker.
Would you hold just a second?
He used your credit card
to check into the Plaza Hotel.
Do they still have him?
Do they have him?
MAN:
No, police are still looking.
Damn it!
We're on the next flight out.
Thank you.
We're going to New York.
-Yes!
-Yes!
He ran away when they
questioned him about the card.
He must be so scared.
Would he go
to my brother's place?
Aren't they in Paris?
Maybe there's a housesitter.
I thought you said
they're renovating.
Hello!
Uncle Rob?
Aunt Georgette?
Anybody home?
Hello!
Anybody home?
It's me,
your favorite nephew Kevin.
Uncle Rob!
Aunt Georgette!
Watch it, kid!
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha!
WOMAN:
Hey, looking for somebody...
to read you a bedtime story?
Taxi!
Boy, it's scary out there.
Ain't much better in here, kid.
I don't want to ever take
a vacation like this again.
Where did all you come from?
I may not have enough
for everybody.
How hungry are you guys?
Well, you guys ate all my food.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Look, I'm sorry
I screamed in yourface.
You were just trying
to help me, right?
I'm Kevin McCallister.
Your birds are real nice.
I've seen you before.
You had pigeons all over you.
At first,
you looked kind of scary.
But when I think about it,
it's not so bad.
They must be all over you
'cause they like you.
If I'm bothering you,
I can leave.
Am I bothering you?
No.
Good.
I'm not a pain in the butt?
No.
Will those pigeons
come back on their own...
or do you have to call them?
WOMAN: Give me your hand.
They can hear it.
This is great.
It's pretty cold out.
I could sure go
for a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you? My treat.
KEVlN: I'd hate to spend
Christmas Eve in Central Park.
Can we go someplace warm?
WOMAN: Yes. I know a place.
KEVlN: Nice music.
This place is great.
WOMAN: I've heard the world's
great music from here.
Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie...
Frank Sinatra...
Luciano Pavarotti.
So, do you bring your friends
up here?
I haven't got many friends.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm like the birds I care for.
People pass me in the street.
They see me,
but they try to ignore me.
They'd prefer
I wasn't part of their city.
Yeah.
It's sorta like that
with my family.
I'm kinda the pigeon
of the house...
just because I'm the youngest.
Everyone fights for position.
Everybody wants to be seen...
and heard.
I guess so.
I'm seen and heard
pretty much...
but then I get sent
to my room a lot, too.
I wasn't always like this,
you know.
Oh. What were you like before?
I had a job...
I had a home...
I had a family.
Did you have any kids?
No.
Oh, I wanted them...
but the man I loved...
fell out of love with me.
That broke my heart.
And whenever the chance
to be loved came along again...
I ran away from it.
I stopped trusting people.
No offense...
but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.
You see, sometimes
you can trust a person...
and then,
when things are down...
they forget about you.
Maybe they're just too busy.
Maybe they don't
forget about you...
but they forget to remember you.
I don't think people
mean to forget.
I think it just happens.
My grandfather says
if my head wasn't screwed on...
I'd leave it on the school bus.
I'm just afraid
if I do trust someone...
I'll get my heart broken again.
KEVlN: I understand that.
I used to have a really nice
pair of roller blades.
I was afraid I'd wreck them...
so I kept them in the box.
-You know what happened?
-No.
I outgrew them.
I never wore them once
outside...
just in my room
a couple of times.
A person's heart
and a person's feelings...
are very different than skates.
Well, they're kind
of the same thing.
If you aren't going
to use your heart...
then what's the difference
if it gets broken?
If you just keep it
to yourself...
maybe it'll be like
my roller blades--
when you do decide to try it...
it won't be any good.
You should take a chance.
You got nothing to lose.
A bit of truth in there
somewhere.
I think so.
Your heart
might still be broken...
but it isn't gone.
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be this nice.
Thank you.
Do you know that it's been...
a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?
That's OK.
You're really good at it.
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit
when you talk.
You should do it more often.
You just have to wear
an outfit...
that doesn't have
pigeon poop on it.
Oh, I have been working
very hard...
at keeping people away,
haven't l?
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...
but being alone isn't much fun.
I don't care how much
people bug me sometimes...
I'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.
So what are you doing
running around the streets...
on Christmas Eve alone?
Did you get into trouble?
Yeah.
WOMAN:
You've done something wrong?
A lot of things.
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?
It's getting pretty late.
I don't know
if I'll have enough time...
to erase
all the bad deeds I did.
Well, it's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds
count for extra tonight.
-They do?
-Of course they do.
So you must think
of the most important thing...
that you can do for others...
and go and do it.
Just follow the star
in your own heart.
OK.
It's getting pretty late.
I better get going.
If I don't see you again,
I hope everything turns out OK.
Thank you.
Say good-bye to your birds
for me.
Oh, I will.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.
I won't forget to remember you.
Don't make promises
you can't keep.
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG: Distant stars
at home up in the heavens
Wonder what they see
Are they watching me?
Christmas star
You watch the world so wisely
At my journey's end
Will you be my true friend?
Starlight, shine bright
See me through the dark night
Light my pathway
Guide me home for Christmas
DUNCAN: All the money
in the cash register...
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.
MARV: At midnight tonight, we're
hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.
You can mess
with a lot of things...
but you can't mess with kids
on Christmas.
CONClERGE:
We'd like to offer you...
a complimentary suite
while you're here.
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.
I think
you'll find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by
the Countess of Worcestershire.
What kind of hotel allows
a child to check in alone?
The boy had a very
convincing story.
What kind of idiots
are working here?
The finest in New York.
PETER: When you discovered
the credit card was stolen--
I made the discovery.
Why did you let him leave?
When we attempted
to confront him, he ran.
You scared him away.
KATE: It's Christmas Eve,
and because of you...
our child is lost in one of
the biggest cities in the world.
Could you take our family
and our luggage up to the room?
Yes, sir.
Run along, Cedric.
I'm going down
to the police station...
and make sure
they're trying to find Kevin.
I want you to stay
with the kids.
-No. I'm going to look for him.
-What?
With all due respect, madam...
your son is lost in one of
the biggest cities in the world.
Could you stay out of this,
please?
As you wish.
Thank you. I don't think
it's a good idea...
for you to run around
New York City all by yourself.
If our son can do it,
I can do it.
Peter, I'll be fine.
The way I'm feeling...
no mugger or murderer
would dare mess with me.
CONClERGE: Madam, there are
hundreds of parasites...
armed to the teeth--
Do bundle up.
It's awfully cold outside.
Marv, Marv, come on. Let's go.
Marv...
crowbars up.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Happy Hanukkah, Marv.
MARV: This is more money
than I can even count.
HARRY: Makes you wonder
why we spent so much time...
robbing private homes.
MARV: Ha ha!
MARV: The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law...
we're up to our elbows
in cash...
and nobody even knows about it.
He's back!
He took our picture!
How did my hair look?
KEVlN: This is it.
No turning back.
Another Christmas
in the trenches.
No!
Wow.
HARRY: That's it. Get the money!
I'll kill him!
That little friggin'
son of a dirty...
-I'm coming, Harry!
-Marv!
HARRY: Aah!
Harry?
Uhhh...
Harry!
That was incredible!
I twisted my ankle
on that board there.
-Where is he?
-Hey, guys, smile!
HARRY: Come on. Come on!
Help me.
MARV: I got you.
I got you.
Taxi!
Times Square.
MARV: Where'd he go?
KEVlN:
I'm up here! Come and get me!
Let's kill!
Hold on, pea-brain.
We got busted last time...
because we underestimated
that little bundle of misery.
This ain't like the last time.
This ain't his house.
The kid's running scared.
He ain't got a plan.
May I do the thinking, please?
Thank you.
Sonny!
Yes?
HARRY: Nothing would thrill me
more greatly...
than to shoot you.
Knocking off a youngster...
ain't going to mean
all that much to me, understand?
KEVlN: Mm-hmm.
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.
You throw down your camera...
and we won't hurt you.
You'll never hear from us again.
OK?
You promise?
I cross my heart
and hope to die.
OK.
OK, kid, give it to me.
MARV: Ohh...
Direct hit!
How many fingers
am I holding up, Marv?
Eight?
OK, kid.
You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead!
Throw another one!
If you can't do any better
than that, kid...
you're gonna lose!
Harry...
no.
You got any more?
Come on, Marv. Get up.
He's out of bricks.
Ha ba...
-What?
-
-What?
-
HARRY: What?
That did it!
Nobody throws bricks at me
and gets away with it!
Marv, get up.
You go this way,
I'll go around back.
Harry?
Harry?
Harry?
Huh?
Yeow!
Oh!
Ohh!
MARV:
Harry, I've reached the top!
Whoa--Aah!
Ahh.
Yaah!
HARRY: Ha ha ha ha ha!
You got to do better
than this, kid!
Ha ha ha--
Ohh...
Uh!
-
-Aah!
Wow.
What a hole.
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Aah! Aah!
Uh-oh.
Oh!
Little creep!
Ah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Aah!
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
Oh!
Ah! Ah! Ah! He did it!
Harry?
I'm coming up!
Uh-oh.
I'm going to murderthat kid.
Ah-choo!
Yes!
Whoa!
Whoop.
Oh!
MARV: Hey!
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?
Harry!
He's in the living room!
He went up the ladder!
Aah!
Ohh...
I'm coming, Harry.
I'm coming.
Harry, Harry.
Hey, you didn't lose any teeth.
Come on.
He went to the second floor.
KEVlN: Hey...
why don't you guys
try the stairs?
MARV: Right.
HARRY:
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Don't you remember
what happened last year?
No.
Watch this.
Let's get him!
Oh! He busted me
right in my mouth, Marv!
That's one.
MARV: Don't worry, Harry!
I'll get him!
Ow!
Right in the schnozz!
HARRY: That's two.
Come on. Let's get him.
MARV: Oops.
-Aah!
-Aah!
MARV: That's...
three.
HARRY: No.
MARV: That's four.
MARV: Come on, Harry.
HARRY:
Marv, are you sure this is safe?
MARV: Oh, yeah.
Yup. I worked all the kinks out.
Solid as a rock.
HARRY: Like a rock, huh, Marv?
KEVlN: Hey, do you guys give up?
Have you had enough pain?
MARV: Never!
HARRY: You better say every
prayer you ever heard before!
MARV: I hope your parents got
you a tombstone for Christmas!
Where'd he go?
I'm up here,
and I'm really scared.
HARRY: What's that sound?
-Aah!
-Aah!
MARV: That was the sound
of a tool chest...
falling down the stairs.
HARRY: Oh.
Yes!
MARV: Over there!
HARRY: I don't care if I get
the chair. I'm killing that kid!
HARRY: Surrender, kid!
MARV: He vanished.
KEVlN: I'm down here,
you big horse's ass!
MARV: Whoa!
Nice night for a neck injury!
Suck brick, kid!
HARRY: Come on, Marv.
MARV: Oh, I don't know.
HARRY: I said, come on.
Come on, you big sissy.
Harry?
You wearing aftershave?
HARRY: That's not aftershave.
That's kerosene.
The rope is soaked in it.
Why would anybody
soak a rope in kerosene?
Merry Christmas.
-Go up!
-Aah!
Aah!
HARRY: Ooch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Ouch! Aah! Ouch!
MARV: Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
HARRY: Get off!
-Aah!
-Aah!
HARRY: Get the bag.
Hello. The two guys who robbed
Duncan's Toy Chest...
are at Central Park West
and 95th Street.
Look for fireworks.
Hurry. They got a gun.
KEVlN: Hey, I'm down here.
Better come and get me
before I call the cops.
Whoa!
MARV:
My, how the tables have turned.
HARRY:
How do you like the ice, kid?
HARRY: Let's go
for a little stroll in the park.
HARRY: Give me that bag!
Gimme it.
These will look great
in the photo album.
You may have won
the battle, little dude...
but you lost the war.
HARRY: You ought not have
messed with us, pal.
We're dangerous.
-Harry.
-Shut up.
Harry...
HARRY:
Shut up. I want to enjoy this.
MARV: Something's wrong.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up, I said!
HARRY: I never made it
to the sixth grade, kid...
and it doesn't look like
you're going to, either.
WOMAN: Let him go!
Kevin, run!
Shoot her! Shoot her!
Shoot her!
I'm trying to shoot her!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Aah!
Bye! Thanks!
OFFlCER: Jeez, it looks like
the Fourth of July!
We'll take the bridge.
You guys get the tunnel.
Let's go. Come on!
Oh, my God!
OFFlCER:
All right, you guys, let's go.
SECOND OFFlCER:
Come on. On yourfeet.
HARRY: Take it easy.
OFFlCER: You guys
should've started earlier.
The prisoners
have already exchanged gifts.
MARV: We missed the presents?
He made us hide out
in a store...
so we could steal
the charity money.
-Shut up, Marv!
-Aah!
HARRY: You got the right
to remain silent, you know.
He's a little cranky.
We just broke out of prison
a few days ago.
Shut up, Marv! Jeez!
-Get them out of here.
-Let's go.
MARV: Remember,
if this makes the papers...
we're no longer the Wet Bandits.
We're the Sticky Bandits!
Ow! That's Sticky!
That's "S"...
HARRY: Shut it!
MARV: "T," uh...
-"l."
-"l."
OFFlCER:
Mr. Duncan, it's all over.
We apprehended the thieves,
and we recovered your money.
DUNCAN: Good.
I want to get that money...
over to the Children's Hospital.
OFFlCER:
I'll handle it personally.
DUNCAN: Thank you very much.
INSPECTOR:
Excuse me, Mr. Duncan.
I found this note.
Looks like a kid
broke your window.
Turtledoves.
Ohh.
KATE: Oh, excuse me.
I'm looking for my son.
He's this boy right here.
Excuse me. Please help me.
This boy right here,
have you seen him?
This one. Please?
I'm looking for my son.
He's been missing
for two days.
OFFlCER:
Have you filed a report?
KATE: Yes, of course we have.
Then trust us.
We'll handle it.
Oh.
But I'm his mother.
I realize that, ma'am...
but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.
Do you have kids?
Yes, ma'am.
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?
I'd probably be doing
the same thing you're doing.
Thank you.
Look, put yourself
in your kid's shoes.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.
Oh, but not Kevin.
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.
I know Kevin's fine.
I'm sure he is.
Fine.
But he's still all by himself
in a big city...
and he doesn't deserve that.
He deserves to be at home
with his own family...
around his Christmas tree.
Oh, dear God.
I know where he is.
I need to get
to Rockefeller Center.
Hop in.
Thank you.
KEVlN: I know I don't deserve
a Christmas...
even if I did do a good deed.
I don't want any presents.
Instead, I want to take back...
every mean thing
I ever said to my family....
even if they don't take back
the things they said.
I don't care.
I'll love all of them...
including Buzz.
If I can only see one,
can I see my mother?
I'll never want another thing
as long as I live.
I just want my mother.
I know I won't see her
tonight...
but promise me
I can see her again...
sometime, anytime.
Even if it's just once and only
for a couple of minutes.
I just need to tell her
I'm sorry.
Kevin?
Mom?
Wow. That worked fast.
KATE: Oh, Kevin.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
KEVlN: Merry Christmas, Mom.
KATE:
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Let's go.
KEVlN:
How'd you know I was here?
KATE: I know you
and Christmas trees...
and this is the biggest around.
KEVlN: Where's everybody else?
KATE: They're at the hotel.
They didn't like
the palm trees, either.
Holy smokes! It's morning!
It's Christmas morning, man.
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.
FULLER: Huh?
I don't think
Santa Claus visits hotels.
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.
He goes everywhere.
Hey, guys, wake up!
It's Christmas!
Mom, Dad, it's Christmas!
FRANK: What?!
GlRL: What on earth?
JEFF: Come on. I wanna find out.
ROD: Oh, wow.
JEFF:
Where did it all come from?
KEVlN:
Mom! Dad! You got to see this!
-Gosh.
-Peter!
BUZZ: Are you sure
we're in the right room?
-Look at all this stuff!
-Yeah!
-Oh, wow!
-Look!
FRANK: Don't open any of mine.
I mean it.
Who's Mr. Duncan?
KATE: Duncan? I don't know.
All right.
Everyone just calm down.
Calm down. Hey, hey!
All right. Now...
if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place again...
then we wouldn't be in this most
perfect and huge hotel room...
with a truckload
of all this free stuff...
so...
I think it only fair...
that Kevin get to open up
the first present.
Then I'll go...
and the rest of you, and so on.
Merry Christmas, Kev.
Merry Christmas, Buzz.
PETER: Merry Christmas, Kevin.
FRANK: OK, Kevin!
All right! Merry Christmas!
Enough of this gooey sh--
show...of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!
-All right!
-Everybody, wait.
LESLlE: Save the paper.
We can use it next year.
Give me the bows.
Merry Christmas.
Kevin!
Merry Christmas!
I got something for you.
What's this?
It's a turtledove.
I have one, you have one.
As long as we each
have a turtledove...
we'll be friends forever.
Oh, Kevin.
Thank you.
I won't forget you. Trust me.
WOMAN: Oh.
Mr. McCallister's
room service bill, sir.
Merry Christmas, sir.
Uh, oh.
Nice family.
Really.
BUZZ: Merry Christmas, indeed.
Oh, Dad...
PETER: Kevin!
You spent $967 on room service?!
