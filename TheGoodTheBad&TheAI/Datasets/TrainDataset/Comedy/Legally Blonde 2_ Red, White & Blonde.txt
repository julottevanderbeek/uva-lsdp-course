The committee of hearing
come first to the order.
HR 2562, AKA, Bruiser's Bill.
Represent the Victoria Rudd of responder
proposing a band of animal testing.
I like to welcome you all at the began
consideration this very important issue.
This week, you were here an expert
testimony from both sides...
that I asked you to keep your ears...
and your minds open.
This is my first congratulate,
can you believe it?
As I come today as a citizen and a scientist
for the Nature Institute for 25 years.
It becoming increasingly clear this suppose
the alternative to animal testy.
Our alternative at all.
I'd like to this all that might
represent two considerations.
Precisely, I saw at a pets store with a label...
"This part is part is testing on human".
Now, that's the problem we're discussing.
We try to discuss for the facts...
the sacker and tucker wide calls noses other
sentimental mumble jumble consider this.
What we see sacker is a part.
We are can see sacker so mind...
and so to move on such a bill
at this junction of time we having...
at already unstable local economic
across the country.
Now, that? The problem we're discussing.
You know I'll do anything for you,
but I got to tell you now, that is one tough
room, you got to be prepare more.
Alright.
Excuse me, ladies, I have to go.
Good evening.
Ok.
I know you have bad day in court,
for the same thing...
they made their case, we made ours.
That was bad.
I think we have the both uncommitted
even without your testimony.
But they have scientist
at the court to listen.
So, do we?
Elle, listen to me.
Go home. Have a early evening.
Sorry.
Victoria Rudd., yes...
Oh, hang on a minute, would you?
Go home, try to relax.
And don't think like them,
think like you.
Ok. Thanks.
- Good night.
- Go night.
Bob, how are you?
Thanks, nice work.
Alright.
Sac?
Oh, here, I'm sorry about that,
this happen all the time.
My break is almost up, but I want to
get you this before tomorrow.
Oh, great, lets walk.
How did you know all these?
- 1000 of plastic bags.
This is perfect;
this is exactly what I need.
Of course I appreciate your support,
why won't you continue?
Alright. I'll do what I can.
Don't push me, Bob.
I don't care.
Alright, good night.
Listen, I need to call my favor.
I'm listening.
I've changed my position
on Bruiser's Bill.
He is good. He is really good.
I? Really glad we're watching this.
This is good for you.
Kenneth, I'm starting to worry about how
may get all this wedding planning done...
Elle, I want you to follow
my lead in Washington.
And always make sure Bruiser
will wear the sweater.
Is that child cindering?
No, that's not child cindering.
Seriously, honey.
Don't worry about
the wedding research.
Just give them hell tomorrow.
The chairs are now recognize
the Elle Woods.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
That she is, guys. She really did it.
Ms. Woods.
How lovely.
Representer Kroft, that lip grosses
is absolutely is intention on you.
I'm sorry, what?
Its Makery number 156, company shall
named it, is that correct?
Yes. Yes, but how did you...
What if I told, Represent Kroft that you owe
the special bound in your steps...
The one that only comes
from buying the perfects lipstick...
To the pain and suffering
at innocent animals.
What is I tell you, hunger women mad
in matter in crock...
that you owe your matter
make up roam...
to him,
my best friend,
Bruiser.
How much time to the act
on my behave... helpless.
But today, I did the opportunity
to speak for him.
Who do you speak for?
Mr. Fued.
The next time when you reach for
your over night moisturizing gloss,
by the way, its nothing to be ashamed
for men to use them.
Consider asking yourself,
would you willing to scarify...
in a name of beauty and soft cubicle.
Are you willing to
scarify animal welfare?
Or how about, just say the
welfare when animal...
like Jerry.
Your child with pals, that striking
retrieve the black classmates.
You know about Jerry?
When all the other children refuse
to play the with you,
who was that always your tender?
Jerry Billy.
Mr. Chairman,
when you look at those steps with
the torment dies on your Rock Leslie.
Did this not make your
heart grow with warm?
To respect Ms. Wood,
I won't go that far.
He learns that between seven different kinds
of pipes and fetch each one on comment.
Do you not swear to protect him
with every shot gun in your...
termining animation case?
It won't come with that, this is a dog we're
talking about. Leslie is a dog.
But, if you could speak for Leslie,
what would you say?
What will Leslie want you to say
for him, Mr. Chairman?
Say.
Oh, here it is.
My Rock Leslie is
a homosexual imitation,
then I'll say, "I'm out."
And my dog is gay.
And guess what?
I couldn? Be part of the little play.
I don? Care how good my hands goes slick
back some high dollars for me,
just one down stair,
into that sneaks sissy dog that I know.
No cosmetic could ever be with it.
Bruiser's Bill.
Bruiser's Bill.
Bruiser's Bill.
We did it.
Bruiser's Bill.
Hey, Bruiser, you worth with that.
I would like to conclude this hearing by
thanking you all with testimony...
Mr. Chairman.
The Chairs had recognized
the general law of restitution.
Mr. Chairman, committee members,
I would like to thank you for
your consideration of this bill.
However after further reflection on this
budget reality in this whole years,
I feel I must draw my support
for Bruiser's Bill.
What?
Everybody calm down.
I'm sorry, Bruiser.
I'm sorry too, Elle.
I know you think I let you down.
Believe me, I thought about your reaction
maybe more than I should have.
By Grace.
Grace?
The last two section, she's been pushing
this homoner intensive bills.
This morning, she struck the deal.
I was draw my support for Bruiser's Bill;
homoner intensive comes to a vote.
That was the price and I paid it.
That's not a deal and trace and secrets.
That's not people wants.
Elle. I'm sorry.
So, what's your story?
You even honest?
I guess you were.
He doesn? Play games and
I think you're the only one.
This is how you did it.
And I even that was happy,
that was really brave...
To trusting you actually
Trusting this system.
Trusting yourself.
I did.
Go on.
We even put the hearts over the eyes.
That? My idea.
Thank you everybody, this is really nice.
But, I... this can? Help for this.
We have a plan, to vote for you.
How about 100 of signature
we can spring Bruiser's Bill...
from committee straight
to the house for the vote.
I don? Know that,
sounds really complicated.
You can part with any of us.
That long maintaining your sparker,
we never sparker.
It means, in anyone of us one person
can make a different until you get on.
Its not really 218 signatures?
It? Not that hard.
Yeah.
I guess I know more shift with that.
Well, that's me.
Elle, is time to finish where you started.
Winnie, I'm still waiting
on those one-minute form...
I need you to read part on that campaign
financial perform hearing.

Now that isn't important anymore.
Could I speak with you for a moment?
Sure.
You did it now.
You won.
You can collect Bruiser's mum
anytime you like.
What?
Well, if you promise not to be disappointed
in me again,
I'll tell you I've pulled a few strings...
said Manifest, is releasing all
of the tested animals.
All of them?
All of them.
And what's more,
they have been so impress on
how you handle yourself down here.
They want you to come on aboard
and head to legal department.
Its a very general offer now.
I don? Know.
You did it. You did what
you came here for do.
But what about the discharge petition?
I mean its just about just want it
at most but all demo.
I agree. But you got a great dement place
that can carry on without you,
same magnify when you up
there by Monday.
You can go home.
Congratulation, Elle.
Wow, thank you.
We have to stick together,
Washington blonde.
Do you haven? Know the representer Hanner that
have lunch today at members dining room?
I skipped lunch today. Have a facial.
Ok. Alright, thanks. I'll call you back.
Yeah.
Emend, I know you probably
in case lock last week now,
but I want you to call me back
when you get this.
I think I'm coming home.
But it? A good thing now, maybe.
Call me back.
Would you leave us alone now?
Excuse me?
Look, I know you've been
working against us.
And I know some how personal.
You don? Like me.
Clearly.
Your bill is trivial to me,
I have my origin.
You know, that's only asking,
Grace...
Homoner Intensive?
I didn't touch that bill.
Its the tax fight for the wealthy.
Haven't you been pushing it
in the last two section?
Look, Victoria had a live interview
with Coney Chance an hour.
I don? Have time for this.
With that interview, she is preparing for?
She's a make up right now.
She's a make up?
Test, 1, 2, 3.
Is Ms Chan is available, I'd like to go over
some ground rows before we go on.
Thank you.
Ok. Thanks.
Doesn't she have beautiful complexion?
She's like a PSA for SPS.
Oh, thank you, Elle. I though you're gone.
Oh, home? No, no, I'm not ready yet.
I've been dumber speaking on this.
I mean actually feeling a little bit mardy.
I thought I need a light spoliation
and hyper separation...
I thought Victoria will have
a good recommendatin for me.
Surely, this isn? A best time.
No, no, I know you? E very busy, so...
I already called your facilist,
but the thing is, she said
you didn't come in today.
Oh, no, no, I went some place else.
Some place new.
Is that all?
No, that's not all.
Every woman knows that a good facial can be
painful experience done probably.
Likely the result and let loch areas is
all over your skin,
swelling paining your teeth and particular...
even more, so facialist pending
so many of the best stars...
payback for the fall, commonly
that's what I like to say.
What are you talking about?
Isn't that's the first rule of the facial that
there is 24 hours window between...
facial and any major occasion,
such as save a day of dancer...
or maybe an interview
with Ms Polly Brovich?
I don't think that's a rule that a Washington
woman can easily forget.
This is ridiculous, can we clear this room?
You lie me about your lunch hour, why?
Because you? E having lunch
with Hanner Feld?
You turn on me against for all these time,
haven't you?
For god sake. Enough, that's enough.
Thank you. Out.
Thank you, I'll be with you at the moment.
Yes. I lied to you, I killed Bruiser's Bill.
You're animal lover, what about

I want to tell you the education that you all

What about Bruiser's Bill,

She's blowing it.
Se, one day I came to Washington
to help my dog Bruiser...
some where along the way I learnt really...
unexpected lesson.
Anyone of you thinking, who is this girl?
And what is this simple small town grow girl
from L.A. has to save all that?
Well, I'll tell you.
Its about something that bigger that me.
This is about the matter that should be the
highest important to every American.
My hair.
You see, this is a salon in Beverly Hill.
Its really fancy and beautiful.
But its impossible to get in there, I mean
I'm not Julia Robert or one of the girls...
so, you just forget it.
But, one day, they called me.
So, I was finally get the chance to sit
on one of the beauty chairs.
I was so excited.
The shampoo girl washed my hair with color
intensive moisturizing conditioning shampoo.
Suppose to say, it was just wrong.
All wrong.
For me. You know?
First, I was angry.
I never realize my anger
was completely distracted,
I had sat there and witnesses,
and I just let it happened.
I didn't get involve in the process.
I forgot to use my voice.
I forgot to believe in myself.
But now, I know better.
I know that one honest voice
can be a liar than a crown.
I know that if we lose our voice,
or we let those who speak
on our behave...
compromise our voice.
This country, this country is fall
on a really bad hair cut.
So, speak up, America.
Speak up!
Speak up for the home of the brave.
Speak up for the land
for free of paunches.
Speak up, America.
Speak up.
And remember,
you are beautiful.
Thank you.
