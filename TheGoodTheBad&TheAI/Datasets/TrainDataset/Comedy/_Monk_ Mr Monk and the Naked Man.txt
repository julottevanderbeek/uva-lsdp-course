Monk
Season 6 Episode 03
? good friends
OKAY?
You get those barricades up?
Yes, sir.
around 1:00 a.m.
at the latest.
Probably midnight.
This a bad time?
It's this MagnaPod.
The thing's brand-new
and it keeps getting stuck.
I can get to the menu,
but every time I press play,
it just goes...
I'm gonna put it away now.
We've got work to do.
And what happened
to your gun?
Right here, back pocket.
Well, I use my gun,
what, maybe once a year.
Use this all the time.
I bet I can guess
what you're thinking.
I bet you can't.
Natalie!
Thank you for coming.
Is he okay?
Yeah. Uh, he doesn't like
the beach.
What's he doing?
Putting on his sand shoes.
What are sand shoes?
I don't know.
Look, we've got
a little problem here.
Clothing optional.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
I just want him
to look around a little bit,
see if we missed something.
It'll just take a minute.
Oh my God, I see one.
Oh no,
there's another one.
This is too risky.
It's too late.
Here he comes.
Let's just distract him.
Monk!
Hey.
There should be a law against
murdering people on a beach.
Who was she?
Actually, we don't really have
that much.
Her name was Vickie Deline.
And she worked in a bar.
What was she doing here?
Well, don't know.
She parked her car up top,
left her keys
in the ignition.
Up the hill?
Why--why didn't she park
down here on the access road?
Any footprints?
No. Uh, it rained
this morning.
But body's over here.
Oh, hey,
like those shoes.
Yeah.
These are my sand shoes.
Nice.
Oh, look at the sand!
Never seen...
sand quite that color.
Mr. Monk, what would
you call that color?
Oh, look. A sand dollar.
No, just a shell.
Here she is.
Here we go.
What are you doing?
Just missed her.??
There's a ? cut.
?
I guess Dr. G missed that.
It's like a paper cut.
Oh yeah, those hurt
like the dickens.
What about
all the stab wounds?
Yeah, they probably hurt too.
There's still sand in it.
It's fresh.
Did you
find anything nearby?
Any papers or an envelope?
Not yet.
Well, she was holding
something.
Maybe that's what the killer
was after.
She's missing
a fingernail.
Yeah.
Yeah, we got that.
Officer!
We found it
on that porch over there.
We haven't found him yet.
Officer, XYZ.
XYZ?
Examine Your Zipper.
?
Must be him now.
Mr. Singer?
I'm Captain
Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD.
There was a homicide
last night.
A woman was murdered.
Oh, wow. No.
All that negative energy.
It's the last thing
the world needs.
Am I right?
Do you know a girl
named Vickie Deline?
I know a couple of Vickies.
I'm not so
into last names though.
Sir, would you mind
putting your shirt on?
May I ask why?
It would just--
it would mean a lot to me.
Sir, we found
a broken fingernail
belonging to the victim
on your front porch.
Where were you last night
around midnight?
I was in jail.
I just got out.
Sir, about that shirt...
I'm gonna have to insist.
All right. Fine.
Whatever.
Well, had one
'cause I had to go to prison.
There we are.
Now I'm one of you.
Are you happy?
Take it you're a nudist.
I prefer naturist.
You know, social nudity
has been around for hundreds
of years, gentlemen.
Get used to it.
There's absolutely no biological
necessity for clothing.
It's a construct.
It's a man-made artifice.
XYZ. XYZ. XYZ.
I'm sorry, I don't know
what that means.
Examine Your Zipper.
Maybe you should examine
your attitude.
taking a look
and see if you recognize her?
You know,
when I first pulled up,
I thought Peter Magneri
sent you.
Peter Magneri?
Magneri Computers Peter Magneri?
Yeah, he lives up there.
He's been hassling me
for years.
That guy owes me 200 bucks.
Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?
But when?
Mr. Magneri,
i just ?
one photograph ?
I appreciate
your seeing us.
I understand
your time is valuable.
Actually, a reporter
worked it out.
I'm worth $300,025
a minute.
Well, then we'll
make it quick.
Do you recognize this girl?
Never seen her.
You didn't even
look at her.
Where's my coffee?
You've already had
four cups, sir.
And your wife said--
Do I need a doctor's note?
No, sir.
I got a clean bill of health
from St. Andrews
less than three weeks ago.
They checked me over,
head-to-toe.
MRIs, X-rays, blood tests.
Do you know what, I'm going
to bury the lot of you.
Coffee, coffee,
coffee now.
She was murdered
last night on your beach.
Oh, not my beach.
It should be my beach,
but it's not my beach.
Don't even
get me started on that.
I didn't actually pay
for this, did I?
No, sir,
that's a thank-you note
from the children
at Lincoln Elementary.
You donated some computers.
The zoning commission
meets on Wednesdays.
You want to come?
Sir, where were you
last night about midnight?
I was here. I'm always here.
I was working late.
Did you see anyone
or hear anything?
Well, as a matter of fact,
there was a woman trying
to get in last night.
She kept on ringing
the buzzer.
Who was she?
How should I know?
Did she say anything?
Yes. Something about
a matter of life and death.
And you didn't let her in.
What, are you crazy?
Everybody wants a piece of me.
Everybody's problem's
a matter of life and death.
Yeah, I know.
Happens to us all the time.
Everybody wants something.
Listen, while we are here,
when I press play
on this thing,
why does it keep
sending me back to the menu?
I have no idea.
Call customer service.
No, no, no.
Ha ha.
They kept me on hold
for an hour and a half.
Look, my warranty
just expired.
If you could take
a quick look at it--
Lieutenant!
Holster your MP3.
That's an order.
Is there a security camera
by the gate?
Yeah, but it's broken.
That's a big surprise.
Look at him,
out there in public.
Mr. Monk,
it's a nude beach!
Degenerate.
That's the other word.
Degenerate!
Being polite.
Where was he last night?
We already spoke
to Mr. Singer.
Oh, he likes to pretend
he's all peaceful and new age-y,
but believe you me,
there's a dark side.
I can tell.
Even from here.
He threatened me once
at a zoning meeting.
Hit me with a microphone.
He's a nudist!
That's what they do.
They--they hit people
with microphones.
Captain.
He's the guy.
He says he was here
all night.
We're going to talk
to his staff.
Not him.
The
Singer?
I already called, Monk.
His alibi checks out.
He was in a lockup
all night.
I don't know how
he did it...
but he's the guy.
I still can't believe it.
She was more than my roommate.
She was my best friend.
I'm so sorry.
How long did you know her?
Three years.
We met at a bar
downtown.
She was waitressing,
and I was working across
the street at the hospital.
I used to be
a lab technician.
Used to be?
I quit...
about two weeks ago
to play the market.
Day trader?
Good for you.
Ask me again
in a few months.
She'd been going
to the beach a lot.
Meeting a nudist?
A nudist?
Was she seeing anyone
in particular?
Uh, I think so.
She'd been hinting
about a guy--
Was he a nudist?
Let me put it another way.
Was he always naked?
Mr. Monk, you're not
letting her talk.
I think she might have been
meeting him last night.
That's him.
I knew it.
You don't know his name.
We all know his name.
Can I talk to you?
Excuse us.
Come here.
What are we doing here?
We should be getting
a search warrant.
We gotta get back
to the beach.
Get into his trailer.
Would you relax?
I have never seen you
like this.
We're wasting our time.
It's the nudist.
We both know it.
I don't know that, Monk.
Look, maybe you're right.
You usually are.
But I have to do
my job here.
I need to dot every I
and cross all the Ts.
You can appreciate that.
Hello.
With different angles.
That would be anarchy,
wouldn't it?
Yes.
And we don't want that,
do we?
No.
Sweetheart,
I can't leave just now.
Mr. Monk isn't feeling
very well.
He saw a naked man today.
I knew you'd understand.
So I'll be there
at 4:30.
I just need to get
the address.
'Scuse me.
May I use this?
Sure.
Go ahead, sweetie.
CDs, huh?
I've gone digital.
Over 5,000 songs in here.
Of course, I can't play
any of them.
Okay. Where were we?
We were talking
about the nudist.
No, we weren't.
We were talking
about the nudist.
No, we weren't.
Um, did, uh, Vickie
have any other--
There it is.
What?
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
'Scuse me.
Okay. Did Vickie have
any other boyfriends
that we need to know about?
no
Wait, Mr. Monk.
I don't think
we should do this.
You got a better idea?
Yes. Not doing it.
Door was open.
Must've been the wind.
Don't we need
a search warrant?
What about
the guy's rights?
All your little rules.
All your little laws.
They don't apply down here.
It's nudie town.
It's a petition to keep
beach clothing optional.
Oh yeah.
That could give somebody
a nasty paper cut.
There's a knife missing.
He was making a sandwich.
He's one step ahead of us.
Hello.
What? What? What?
Skinless chicken.
Seedless grapes.
You see how it's all fitting
together?
No.
look,Sugar in the raw.
Mr. Monk, you're scaring me.
I've never seen you
like this.
It's like you want
this man to be guilty.
Mr. Monk, there's something
that I have to tell you.
When I was an exchange student
in Greece--
Oh. Someone's coming!
The nudists.
It's the nudists.
The nudists are back.
The closet!
No! There's no room!
Oh yeah. No clothes.
Okay, I'll get the light here.
Do you have
anything to drink?
Oh yeah, sure, in the fridge.
Anything you want.
So who was she,
the girl who was killed?
Right, and they think
that you're actually involved
in this somehow.
I'm not surprised.
They're always looking
for a reason
I get kids coming
down here every night.
Maybe she was looking
to score some drugs
or meet a dealer,
I don't know.
Can we just talk
about something else?
Yeah.
All this murder talk's
really bringing me down.
Yeah. It's sad.
All right. To business.
Yeah. Okay. So, Jenny,
can you take some notes?
Sure.
Okay, yeah.
Anybody got a pen?
Whoops. 'Scuse me.
Sorry.
I got one!
Oh, cool. Whoops.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It rolled down that way.
I don't see it.
Maybe under
the fridge.
Under the fridge?
Where?
I'm getting tired of this.
Just get a new pen.
If I get lower,
I can see more.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Isn't that it right there??
The other foot.
No, Chance's foot.
Where?
There it is.
I see it.
It's right under there.
We're good to go.
Very good.
Nice grasp.
Sorry about that, guys.
Slid all the way down there.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Marin County Court House.
This is it, people.
The Super Bowl.
Peter Magneri's
gonna buy their votes anyway.
Hey, no negative thoughts.
Come on.
You gotta stay positive.
It's our beach.
Nobody can take it from us,
right?
And also here's the thing...
we have to go textile.
and we don't want
to do anything
to offend these people.
Plus, I think it's illegal.
Forget it. I don't have
anything to wear.
Literally.
Huh.
You know, I have an old suit
in the closet.
You don't want--
It doesn't matter.
Just keep running!
What friends
are you talking about?
Let go of my hand now.
Where's your warrant?
Where are your trousers?
Why don't you people
just leave us alone?
We're just trying
to live our lives.
So was Vickie Deline.
I know you were seeing her,
Singer.
Her roommate told me.
Her roommate.
What happened?
She didn't want to join
your little cult?
She tried to run.
You grabbed the knife.
I did not know the girl.
Liar!
I never met her!
Will you get out
of my face, please?
No, no, no.
No, I know that trick.
I step back,
I see the whole schmegge.
Mr. Monk,
are you okay?
Your friend here
is psychotic!
We both know you did this.
Mr. Monk!
How? Tell me that!
I was in prison all night!
There are 20 witnesses.
Check it out.
Don't think I won't.
Natalie, let's go.
He was here all night.
Yeah, booked at 7:30 p.m.
and released at 8:00 a.m.
the next morning.
It was definitely him?
Positive ID.
You want to see
the fingerprints?
What was he in for?
He was collecting petitions
at a strip mall.
Strip mall.
Doesn't mean anything,
Mr. Monk.
That's what they're called.
Well, he got out.
Somehow, he got out.
And back in again.
Without the guards
noticing.
Excuse me.
Where did you get that?
From the guard.
How about this?
The guard gives Singer
an apple.
Singer chews the apple core
into the shape of a key.
He fashions a rudimentary kiln
using that light bulb
in his kiln, and uses it
to pick the lock.
Thank you.
An apple core key.
No?
Okay.
He slipped through the bars
and out the bathroom window.
How?
He wiggled through.
He's a nudist.
They're all double-jointed.
They are?
They're not like us.
look,I-I have a theory.
I-I think--
I think they secrete a fluid.
It makes them all slippery.
They can wiggle
through anything.
They're like slugs.
There was a guard on duty
all night.
Then he's in on it too.
He's one of them.
Well, what about the 20 cops
that are outside?
They're all in on it!
Don't you see?
It's a cabal.
What?
Sometimes they're naked.
Sometimes they go around dressed
to confuse us.
Well, they're certainly
doing that.
Have you read their literature?
I have.
They want to convert us all.
like them, on beaches,
in parks,
hanging out...
everything hanging out.
Hanging and hanging.
Captain, there's only one way
to deal with them.
We gotta ship them back.
Exactly.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down
Look, I don't know
what happened
on that beach
Monday night.
I do not know
who killed that girl.
Actually,
I have another--
Let me finish.
Don't you talk.
This is not a conversation.
This is an intervention.
I'll tell you
what I do know.
Number one--
it was not Chance Singer.
Captain!
Chance Singer
was in my jail
all night long.
Number two--
you are off this case.
You--
You-you're defending them?
Monk, this is
San Francisco!
There's a million weirdoes
out there.
Some of them
are wearing clothes.
Some of them are not.
And yes,
I am defending them.
That's what this means.
We defend them.
I spend a lot of my time--
too much of my time--
trying to keep bigotry
and racism
out of this department.
I am not a bigot.
Well, I don't know what else
to call it, Monk.
You wanna put this guy away
for the rest of his life
because he makes you
uncomfortable.
Look,
you've always had issues.
But this isn't just
another quirk or phobia.
Like, uh,
your fear of clowns
or round things.
This is different.
This is new.
And weird.
And ugly.
First of all, I am not
afraid of round things--
Monk,
you're a great detective.
Look at it
like it's a mystery.
There's something
going on here.
Something's going on
inside of you.
Figure it out.
Detective.
I don't wanna see you
back here until you do.
This is...
this is not fair treatment.
How do people
wear these things?
I feel like
I'm suffocating.
I know.
I'm chafing.
Are you chafing?
Hey, does anyone have
any more of that powder?
I need it.
Hey, there he is.
Peter! Mr. Magneri.
Channel 7 News.
How do you feel?
I feel great.
I feel
the Board of Supervisors
will do the right thing.
They understand
that I'm just a taxpayer.
All I want
is a front lawn of my own
where I can relax
and play with my kids.
The problem is, Mr. Magneri,
Barr Beach
is not for sale.
It belongs to the people
of San Francisco.
Mr. Singer,
is that really you?
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.
You look almost human.
yeah
California has been blessed
with 1,200 miles
of coastline.
Surely there's another beach
somewhere
where Mr. Singer
and his freaky friends
can throw their Frisbees.
Look, the real issue here
is that
I am a high-profile
individual.
I need my own beach
for my privacy
and my personal security.
A young woman,
as you may recall,
was murdered on that beach
only recently.
And the police have been
questioning Mr. Singer
about that very incident.
You can't say that.
You can't just accuse people.
I'm not accusing you,
sir.
Adrian Monk
is accusing you.
Mr. Monk happens to be
the finest detective
in San Francisco,
and he has confided in me
that Mr. Singer
is his primary suspect.
And you believed him?
Adrian Monk is certifiable.
He was in my house last night
without a warrant,
hiding in my closet.
I was gonna press charges,
but frankly,
I feel sorry for him.
I hope he gets the help
he needs, I really do.
There's something
I never told you.
Something happened
when I was a boy
There was an incident.
With a...
with a man.
Who was that?
I'd never seen him before.
Stranger.
How old were you?
I don't remember.
Young.
I was...so small.
I remember...
I remember
I was naked.
Take your time.
I was so naked.
I just hated
being naked.
And I remember...
I was crying.
And then...
he hit me.
Adrian, I'm so sorry.
There was blood.
There was blood everywhere.
I was screaming.
I wanted him to stop.
And my mother...
my mother was smiling.
W-w-wait, your--
your mother was there?
Why didn't she stop him?
She was supposed
to protect me.
He kept hitting me.
Swinging me around
upside down, and...
were upside down?
Was he wearing a mask?
I never wanted
to be naked again.
Adrian,
that man was a doctor.
You're remembering
your own birth.
Doctor...doctor?
Anybody else,
I wouldn't have believed it.
But you...
Doctor?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that would explain
a lot, actually.
The lights,
and my father
in the doorway
holding a balloon.
You feel better?
Yes.
I do.
Wow.
That only took
Hello!
Sorry, the door was open.
Natalie, listen.
Monk, I'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to call.
Something happened.
I was talking to Dr. Kroger.
I remembered something.
Mr. Monk.
There's been something
I've been trying to tell you.
When I was 19--
Is this gonna be
a long story?
Please let me finish.
I was an exchange student
in Greece.
And there was this
beautiful beach that was about
three blocks away
that I went to all the time.
Great.
And this is the thing,
Mr. Monk.
Um...
It was a European beach.
Which means...topless.
I don't care.
I had a breakthrough.
I was a nudist, Mr. Monk.
I was one of them.
I went back
four years ago,
so technically I guess
I still am one.
I was in the cabal.
No, Natalie, forget that.
I mean, maybe it means
you can't work with me anymore,
but I don't care.
I'm not apologizing for it.
I met the best people.
It was the most amazing time
of my life.
Great.
Natalie, listen.
I am not that guy anymore.
It's okay.
I had an amazing session
with Dr. Kroger.
I went back.
I went way back.
Way, way, way, way,
way back, back.
Back, back, back,
back, back.
And I got past it.
This whole naked thing.
I understand it now.
Wow.
And guess what
I just did?
I walked through
Bishop Park.
You know, the big statue?
The nude statue
of the nude woman?
I looked right at it.
Mr. Monk, the statue
in Bishop Park is a man.
Okay, I glanced at it.
But I wasn't completely
and totally repulsed.
I didn't black out.
And I didn't throw up!
Wow. You know,
there's a word for that.
Progress.
Progress, that's me.
Only 312 other issues
to go!
Well, I guess we'll just
take 'em one at a time.
Let's start
with dryer lint.
Hey, I guess this means
you owe Chance Singer
an apology.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Maybe I'll bring him something.
Like a bottle of wine
or some overalls.
What's this?
What?
Oh, a note.
No, I mean this stationery.
This is...
This is from
Vickie's roommate.
?
Piece of scrap paper.
St. Andrews Medical Center.
Radiology, Natalie.
Radiology.
My God.
i know what happened
What?
...Vickie.
?
I know who killed her.
What are you doing?
The yellow copy is for you
and your lawyer.
You worked at St. Andrews
Hospital, is that right?
You were an X-ray technician.
Did you ever meet
Peter Magneri?
Who?
Peter Magneri.
He founded Magneri Computers.
They make these.
I thought yours broke.
Yeah, I bought another one.
Life's too short, right?
Mr. Magneri had
a checkup July 23rd.
That's four days
before you quit.
I got a clean bill of health
from St. Andrews
three weeks ago.
They checked me for everything,
head to toe.
We just spoke
to the SEC.
Apparently, since July,
you've been very interested
in the Magneri company,
except you haven't been
investing.
You've been selling short.
You've been betting
against the company.
Randy.
Turn it off.
I'm sorry.
It won't stop.
Here's what happened.
Three weeks ago,
Magneri went in for a checkup.
You were the lab tech. on duty
You must have noticed something
on his X-rays.
Something serious.
Something that could kill him.
It was the ultimate piece
of inside information.
inside.
Peter Magneri
Magneri Computers.
You knew if anything happened
to him,
the stock would plummet.
All you had to do
was switch X-rays
and put a different label
on it.
Magneri got
a clean bill of health.
Nobody knew how sick
he really was,
not him,
not even his doctor.
You quit your job
and started selling short,
betting against the company.
When Magneri died,
you'd make a small fortune.
At some point,
Vickie found out.
Maybe you were looking
for a partner.
Maybe you were just bragging.
But Vickie wasn't
like you.
She couldn't just sit back
and do nothing
and wait for another human being
to die.
She tried to warn Magneri.
You knew you had to stop her
by any means necessary.
That night,
Vickie told Magneri
it was a matter
of life or death.
She was talking
about him.
His life or death.
You killed her on the beach
and you took back the X-ray.
That's insane.
You don't have any--
Proof?
Mr. Monk found this.
It was hidden
behind your toilet.
Behind your toilet.
Got it.
i don't know??
??
Tell that
to Vickie's family.
You're under arrest.
it'll be two counts
of murder.
How bad is it?
That spot?
It's called
an aortic aneurysm.
He's a heart attack
waiting to happen.
Any excitement,
any stress at all,
could kill him.
The, uh...
the zoning board.
this??
repeat??
??
roger??
What?!
What kind of verdict
is that?
You're pathetic,
all of you.
Mr. Magneri,
please sit down.
The decision of the board
is final.
I will not sit down.
This is a travesty!
They don't even pay
their taxes!
Hello?
Oh, thank God.
Mr. Singer, it's Adrian Monk.
Don't hang up.
Oh, Monk, I don't want
to talk to you right now.
I'm in too good of a mood.
We just won our case.
Ugh, the hippies won.
Is Peter Magneri
still there?
Yeah, why do you care?
Chance, you've gotta trust me.
It's a matter
of life or death.
What do you mean,
life or death?
Oh, put your clothes back on,
you freaks!
Oh, this isn't over.
I'm gonna appeal this
all the way to Sacramento!
We can't appeal.
It's a--
Shut up!
You are so fired.
members of the board.
I'd like to have
your attention.
Could I have
everyone's attention?
Uh...the Naturist
Beachfront Committee
would like to withdraw
its petition at this time.
What?
Are you crazy?
We've granted your group
the rights to that property
in perpetuity.
Well, we're giving it back.
You know,
we were talking about it,
and--and the beach
is a little rocky
for our tastes,
a little tough on the feet.
So we're gonna find
another beach.
are you??
Wait a minute, Singer.
Is this a trick?
No, my friend.
This is no trick.
You've won.
The beach is yours.
You've won.
Breathe.
Relax.
That's good, sit.
Let me adjust your chi.
What's going on?
Mr. Magneri.
Sir, we need to get you
to the hospital.
Hospital?
Trust me, sir.
You're a very sick man.
I'll explain everything
on the way.
He's right, sir.
I've seen your X-rays.
We've got an ambulance
waiting downstairs.
X-ray?
Hi. Remember me?
Listen, I don't want
to upset you or anything,
but, uh...
my MagnaPod died.
No, I-I bought
another one.
And, uh, it's the second one
I've bought in three months.
Randy, give it a rest.
No, it's no big deal.
You see, it just keeps
getting stuck on "menu."
So, I mean, and my Walkman
never did that.
Well, get yourself
another Walkman!
Leave me alone.
No, no, it's no big deal.
Here, put it in here--
Randy, Randy, Randy!
Just listen--
Randy, give me this.
Give me this.
You're right,
it's broken.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, yeah.
Moving on up.
Peter Magneri bought us
our own island
down the coast.
It's the least he could do.
You saved his life.
Oh, well, yeah, sure.
I'm his neighbor.
That's what neighbors do,
right?
Mr. Monk?
Yeah, look at that cloud.
What does that cloud
look like to you?
Huh?
What cloud?
Oh, there's a cloud.
Way up there.
You guys talk.
I'm gonna keep looking at it
for a while.
Well, hey,
if you're ever in, uh,
San Diego,
give us a call.
You won't have to crouch
in the closet this time.
Okay.
I'd love to.
But I promised Mr. Monk
I wouldn't be visiting
any nude beaches until
five years after he's dead.
you wanted to say?
Uh, yeah.
Chance...
I'm sorry for hating you
and accusing you of murder,
and I've learned a lot,
and I'm a better person.
Hey, you know,
we're all just caught here
on this crazy,
big blue marble
doing the best we can.
Am I right?
Yeah, right.
Right?
Come here.
COME HERE??
??
He wants a hug.
Come on.
Come here.
Little closer.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Good.
good
Oh, yeah.
You're a good hugger.
You smell good.
Real good.
Good.
Thanks.
You want a wipe?
No, I'm good.
Mr. Monk?
Mr. Monk?
Mr. Monk!
