Sarah!
Sarah!
Hollering ain't gonna
do you a damn bit of good, Clayton.
Yeah.
I got my foot stuck in a rut.
There she is, right there. She's dead.
OK. All right.
That's a big old heifer, ain't it?
Yes, she took second place
at County last year.
-
- Damn it! What the hell?
Shine the light on her belly.
Shine the light on the belly.
Something's going on.
There's something in there.
-
-
Holy flying baby shit!
God damn piece of crap!
I got a lighter.
That smell would knock a buzzard
off a gut truck.
-
-
- Fuck!
- That's the gassiest damn cow I ever...
Ow! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Whoa! Shit!
- Dang it!
- Clayton!
Get away!
Aah!
-
-
Hey! It's time to get wet again!
- Woo!
- Come on down!
Our lifeguards are hot, single,
and ready to party
with someone like you!
- You!
- Wet 'em down, boys.
So if you wanna cool off, come on down
to the hottest hole in town.
- Three words for you...
-  The Big Wet!
Remember, double D swims free!
Oh, boy. Hold on, cut it, cut it.
Cut it.
-
-  Cut.
-  Hey.
- Hi!
I gotta cut somethin' off at the pass.
Here you go. Keep 'em wet.
And are you guys friends of someone?
Maddy.
Get over here
and give your stepdad a hug.
Chet, tell me you did not fire
our old lifeguards
and replace them with... strippers.
- Water-certified strippers.
- Really?
- More than that, pumpkin.
- Unbelievable.
Listen. Before your sweet mama died,
God rest her soul,
she made me promise her
to keep this water park running,
and I am just gonna make sure that
I provide for you as well as she did.
I'm your daddy now.
We're so lucky to have each other.
Wow, Chet.
Sometimes I think you really believe
what's coming out of your mouth.
Come here, doll.
You are gonna love this.
"Adult Pool"?
Go ahead.
We are gonna make bank on this!
What do you think?
I think this is a very expensive joke.
The world's first strip bar
at a water park?
That's a stroke of genius.
Franchising, baby.
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, don't worry about that.
You just throw a little extra chlorine
and sulfuric acid in the pool,
sanitizes everything.
Hey, Kiki, why don't you get
your shapely ass out of the pool.
Russian. Huh? She's a doctor.
Now keep your eyes over there
on the flat screen TV.
I call this the "Cooch Cam,"
but I'm open to suggestions.
Check it out. Oh...
- That's disgusting. Absolutely not.
- Do not touch it.
- I'm getting rid of it.
- Don't you touch it!
That's not your call.
Don't you forget
that I'm still half owner of this place.
Oh, is that right? Raise your hand
if you own 51 percent
of this water park.
Now raise your hand if you're
a 49 percent minority owner.
That's you.
- Hey! Hi, ladies.
- Hi, Maddy.
- Hey, Maddy.
- How are you? What's new?
Well, this is the summer Shelby
finally abstains from abstinence.
- Ah!
- Shut up!
She's afraid to have sex
because her slutty cousin
gave birth to a flipper baby.
Stop it! You're not
supposed to say that.
- That didn't happen.
- Ooh, here he comes.
The boy who's gonna pop her cherry.
- He just doesn't know it yet.
-
Hey, Maddy. What do you think of
all the new changes around here?
- Josh, meet me at the lake.
- Hi.
- Come on.
- All right. See ya. Cool.
What, am I the last guy
to know you're back?
- Hi!
- Hey there!
- How are you? I missed you.
- Oh, me too.
Bet you wish you were still in
grad school for the summer, huh?
- I can't believe what Chet's done.
- I know.
This place is everything to me.
Working here, hanging out.
I know. I miss those moments, too.
So, look, now that you're back...
Hey, you guys, are you sure
that's such a good idea?
-
- Ho!
-
- Whoa!
There better not be
any underage drinking going on here.
- Hello, Kyle.
- Hey, come on, man. I'm on duty.
I can't be drinking.
We got fireworks, indecent exposure...
-
- ... probable drugs.
Definite drugs.
I may just have to write you up.
- Hi, Kyle.
-
I don't see what he has
that I don't have.
Six inches and a badge.
I heard you were back in town,
so I figured I'd stop by
and say hey.
And I also feel like I should
say something about
the last time we talked.
No, you don't have to. Long-distance
relationships, they're weird.
- But you're back now.
- For the summer.
Should be an interesting summer.
I... I...
- I'm still on duty, so...
- OK.
Welcome back.
I had fun
at the party tonight.
Yeah, yeah. Me too.
I love the water.
It's, uh, really...
...wet.
What are you thinking about?
- Nothin' much.
-
Hey, let's take off all our clothes
and go swimming.
Uh...
OK, cool. Sure. Yeah, all right.
- Turn around.
- Oh, right. Sorry.
Shelby?
Shelby?
Shelby!
- You coming in or what?
- Yeah, I'm coming.
No funny stuff, OK?
All right.
You want some of this?
You want some, huh?
You're not supposed to splash me back!
- What?
- I just felt something against me.
- Is that you?
- What? What are you talking about?
Ow! What are you?
What are you doing?
- I didn't...
- Well, whatever it is, I don't like it!
I didn't do anything.
Shelby, where are you going?
I'm cold. I'm getting out.
-  Wait. You have to do it.
-  OK, fine.
- OK.
-
Dear Lord.
- Come on.
- OK. Dear Lord.
Please forgive us
for what we are about to do.
We each know that having
relations before marriage is a sin,
but...
...we know that we will be forgiven...
...for it because...
...we're praying about it.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- You can fuck me now.
- Amen!
Oh, look at this.
- Do you like that?
-
Aw...
Mine.
Ah.
Don't make me cuff the other one.
We're moving, Travis.
- I know, I know.
- No!
Look, you idiot!
- Ashley! You OK?
- Yeah.
Water's coming in. Shit!
Give me the key for the cuff!
- Uh, it must've fallen out.
- Find it! Now!
-  Where is it?!
-
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit. Damn it!
Where's the key for the damn cuff?!
- I should go for help.
- No!
- I can't see anything! I'm sorry!
- Ashley!
Hit the dome light and keep looking.
Shit!
What are you doing?!
Get over here!
- Ashley!
- I'm gonna go for help!
Get back here!
What are you doing?!
Ashley! Damn!
-
- Travis?
Travis?
- Travis!
-
Ow!
- There's something in the water!
-
Help!
Anybody!
Somebody help me! Ashley!
Travis? Come on, are you there?
Travis?
Travis!
- Ashley!
-  Oh, my... Oh, my God.
Oh, my... Help! Oh, my God!
Please! Is anybody out there?
Anybody?!
I'm sorry. I just...
No, it's cool.
I don't mind hanging out.
No, it's not you. It's just that...
Do you think Ashley's
prettier than me?
- No.
- Most guys do.
Yeah, well, I've never really
been into girls with big breasts.
Aw.
Welcome back, Maddy.
- Dave?
-
What the fuck you doing?
The hole where the water comes out.
- Oh, God, man.
- She's so wet!
Hey, Shelby, have you seen
Ashley or Travis?
Neither one of them
punched in this morning.
No, I haven't seen either of them.
I don't know.
Just a sec.
- You OK?
- I just feel a little weird. It's OK.
- Here, let me help you.
- No, no, I'm fine. Really.
-
- You OK?
Whoa! Look who has morning sickness!
Nice work, papa.
Nobody was inside, Shel.
I'm sure they're fine.
Probably just shaken up and scared
they're gonna get in trouble.
- Oh, my God. Come on, Ash. Pick up!
-
-
- Shit! Call me!
Is there... Is there anywhere
else they might've gone or?
No, I don't... I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.
Ashley's my best friend.
I mean... I know she's kind of a slut,
and she's stolen 11
of my ex-boyfriends and...
...I'm pretty sure
she also stole a pair of earrings
that my grandmother gave me
before she died, but...
...we were like sisters.
What is that?
Oh, my God.
We have to get off of this thing
right now. Hurry!
Come on, Shelby!
- Get out! Come on!
-
- Shelby, grab my hand!
-
Quick, come on, I've got you!
-
- Hurry, come on. Let's go!
Come on! Quickly!
Let's go! We're almost there!
-
- Careful!
No, no, no! Come back, Shelby!
-
- Come here! Come this way, quick!
You're gonna have to jump!
- Come on, you're gonna have to jump.
- Maddy, I can't jump from here!
- Let's go!
-
Come on, it's just a foot!
- Grab my hand! I got you!
-
What is this thing?
Maddy?
What the fuck is that?
Ugh.
-
-
- Fuck. Oh, shit.
-  Oh, my God!
Is that a fucking piranha?
I'm telling you, man, it was a piranha.
How'd they get from
Lake Victoria to our lake?
That's what we've gotta find out.
-
- What?
Look at us.
The cop and the marine biologist.
I'm sorry. That just
sounds like a shitty sitcom.
-
-
You're still wet.
A little, yeah.
Guys, can one of you open the door?
Kyle, open the door.
Little man.
That's funny.
Dick.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
- Sir, we saw you on YouTube.
- You and 11 million, 486 other people.
I have 700 more hits
than the Laughing Diarrhea Baby.
Uh, we need your expertise,
Mr. Goodman.
Why?
We think they're back.
Cross Lake isn't even connected
to Lake Victoria.
The piranha must be migrating
through underground lakes and rivers.
I've studied this specimen
for almost a year.
-
-
Here, Meanie.
-
-
I think you might
find this interesting.
- You need some help?
- Yeah.
OK, this is galvanized steel,
like ordinary household plumbing.
There we go.
Aha! Now, for some incentive.
-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
No, no, no, not the frog. Aah!
Sorry, I... sold out of puppies
this morning.
OK...
Now, I think this is
quite resourceful. Watch.
-
-
Come on, come on, come on.
Now it's got something to grab.
-
- Oh, dear! Fuck!
Barry, are you crazy?!
You almost lost a hand!
I had a pet frog once.
Come on. OK. Come here.
Really?
Now check out some data.
What were you thinking?
These piranha spent eons
living in underground
lakes and rivers
full of sulfur dioxide
from all the geothermal activity.
That's how they come back to spawn.
- They follow the rotten egg smell.
- Yes.
Problem is, sulfur dioxide
is commonly released
during the treatment
of chlorinated water.
So it's conceivable
that the fish could become...
...confused...
...and try to enter man-made
drainage systems.
Especially with all the shocking
abundance of backyard pools.
Our water park drains directly
into Cross Lake.
That's like the equivalent
of a thousand swimming pools.
Oh, that would be a very bad thing.
Did you tell anyone
that this could happen?
I tried. Unfortunately,
I lost some credibility
after my last book foretold
a dreadful plague of walking fish.
Oh, that's right!
You wrote
I loved that book.
That's really great.
Why, thank you...
...kindred spirit.
Mm-hm.
Thanks.
Barry... you, uh...
You read a marine biology book?
Well, I wanted to see
what you're so interested in.
Guys, we've gotta check the drains over
the outflow pipes in the lake, tonight.
I could get a dive team up here
from Tempe by tomorrow.
No, that's too late.
The water park opens tomorrow,
that place is gonna be packed.
If the fish are getting through
the drain system...
That would make Lake Victoria
look like an appetizer.
Guys, we've gotta get
out there right now.
Thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Goodman.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Honor.
- OK. Be well.
- It's a pleasure...
- Aha! 11 million, 888 hits!
-
Take that, Laughing Diarrhea Baby!
Thanks for letting me stay here.
It's totally cool.
How you feeling?
- A little better.
- You don't seem any better.
-
- Hey, what is it?
It's just the stress
of the whole Ashley thing and...
Make love to me.
- Please.
- Right now?
Please, Josh.
Right now. I...
I think something's
really wrong with me,
and I... if I don't...
If I don't get better,
I don't want to die a virgin.
Please, Josh.
I want it to be with you.
Just come inside me.
Come inside me, I'll do
whatever you say after that.
The outflow pipes down there
link directly to the water park.
I've gotta check them out.
You've considered
how batshit crazy this is, right?
I've gotta take a look.
I'll be quick.
Um, look, about what I was
trying to say last night...
Are you coming in?
Because I could really use a spotter.
- What?
- I mean, if you're... It's OK.
No, no, no, I'm not scared.
It's just, um...
...I can't swim.
You work at a water park
and you can't swim?
Ding-ding.
What about all the beach parties
in high school,
or the parties at the park?
You never?
My God, Barry, I totally
would've taught you how to swim.
No, yeah, I know.
You seemed kind of busy at the time.
Not a big deal.
Toss me that flashlight.
Yes, I know. That's
what I said, Chet, but she won't listen.
All right, I'll find you.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No.
You, uh, let her go in there alone?
Fuck off, Kyle.
Oh, yes, Barry can't swim.
- Maddy!
-
- Maddy!
- Maddy!
Swim, Maddy!
- Shit.
- Get out of the way! Get back!
- Are you OK?
- I think so.
Don't worry. I won't break.
-
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No, it's OK, it's OK. I like it.
Go on.
- Oh, God, Shelby.
- Fuck me.
- Aah...
- Oh, my God. Yes!
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God, Shelby.
No, something's not right.
No, please!
No, something's wrong,
something's wrong!
Oh, my God.
-
- No, something's wrong!
Almost there! Almost there!
- What the fuck?
-
What the fuck is on my dick?!
Oh, my...
Oh! Oh, my God!
What the fuck?!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!
-
Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus Christ.
-
- Oh, Jesus!
Josh?
I'm feeling a little better now.
Josh?
Josh?
Josh?
I think I had an accident.
Josh?
Josh, what are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Josh?
Josh?
Josh?
Josh?
Josh?
What the hell did you do to me?!
-
- Oh...
You were almost going 70
back there, buddy.
Don't you have
someplace better to be?
Like boning my stepdaughter?
I'll get to that.
First things first.
You're all good.
- For now.
- Oh, you looking for a raise?
With any luck, your little
theme park's gonna take off,
and I won't have to live off
a deputy's salary forever.
So... we're good here?
Yeah. Did you check those
outflow pipes at the lake?
Maddy did.
Nearly got herself killed.
What about the grates?
Are they still intact?
Should be good. Unless there's
another way into the park.
Like that bootleg well you drilled.
- Don't you worry about that.
- I do worry, Chet.
I'm the one protecting
your unlawful ass.
Let me tell you something.
Why don't you worry about keeping Maddy
and Johnny Law off my ass, all right?
- I'll take care of my water park.
- OK.
- Have a nice night, Deputy.
- You, too, Chet.
Oh, by the way...
- What in the hell's this?
- I told you you were speeding.
- Are you shitting me?
- Just doing my job.
You're a crooked cop.
What a night, huh?
So, um... you and Kyle.
You guys are gonna
get back together, or?
No. Definitely not.
I don't... I don't think so.
Probably not.
You really ran the gamut
of indecisiveness on that one,
- you know that, right?
- Yeah, I kind of did, didn't I?
Josh cut off his penis because
something came out of my vagina.
He should be coming to shortly, so the
nurse is gonna take you guys back there.
You guys can probably go.
Josh is still sedated, and I'm gonna
stick around to get a statement.
I'll let you guys know
if I find anything out, OK?
How's Shelby?
She's not making
a whole lot of sense right now,
but I'll keep an eye on her, too.
- What about you? You all right?
- I'm pretty tired.
Get some rest and I'll call you.
# I'm the love hunter
# Hear what I say
# Get on your knees
# Learn how to pray
# 'Cause the love hunter's comin'
# To take you away
# The love hunter's comin'
# Today...
That is so sad.
Come to bed, Hoffy.
It's nappy time.
# I am the love hunter
# Hear what I say
# Looks like Dawn
# Is ready to play...
I'm Rochelle.
I'm Dawn.
Right.
# I am the love hunter
# Two chicks for me
# 'Cause I am the biggest star on TV #
Yeah! Yeah, let's party!
Welcome to rock bottom.
Excuse me. Can we?
Please? Thank you.
Wait.
I don't know if I can do this.
All you gotta do, take baby steps.
Just little baby steps.
What the hell you talking
about baby steps for?
In case you haven't noticed,
fish ate my damn legs.
I hate the water. I hate it.
Remember what Dr. Smith said.
This is all about our road to recovery.
We'll start out
with a harmless little kiddie pool.
I mean, what's the worst
that can happen?
A couple kids whizzing, that's all.
Kids whizzing?
I can handle that.
I'm not afraid
of some punk-ass water.
I'm not afraid
of some punk-ass water.
I can't.
Don't worry about it.
We'll figure out something else.
- Uh...
- No, it's weak.
Dump me in the water.
- What?
- You heard what I said.
Get behind the chair,
grab the handles,
and dump my sorry ass
in the water.
The way that parents toss their kids
into the pool when they wanna swim?
That's a great idea. OK.
All right, I can do this. Here we go.
- One, two...
- Just stop!
OK. OK, right. What happened?
- Why'd you stop?
- You said stop.
No, don't listen to my pussy-ass mouth.
No matter what I say,
dump me in the water.
OK, got it. Not gonna listen
to your pussy-ass mouth.
I mean, you don't have a pussy-ass
mouth, I'm just saying...
- Dump me in the water.
- OK, OK. Here we go.
- One, two...
- Ah, shit. No, no, I changed my mind!
- No, no, no, you're going in.
- No, I changed my mind.
- I don't wanna go in the water.
- You're going in.
- No, I don't wanna go in!
- Hey!
- You're going!
- No!
- Leave him alone!
- No, no, no, he wants to go in.
No, the hell I do.
I don't wanna go in.
What's wrong with you? Don't push
that poor legless stump into the pool.
Yeah, that's right, don't dump
this poor legless stump in the pool.
OK, you know what?
You're gonna go into the water.
- No, I don't wanna go!
-
Not cool, man.
I'm not afraid
of some punk-ass water.
Not cool at all.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
hot moms of all ages,
- welcome to The Big Wet!
-
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.
The most famous lifeguard of all time.
Who wants to party with the Hoff?
Welcome, David Hasselhoff!
-
-
Here he is, David Hasselhoff!
Ladies.
You know, ladies,
if you play your cards right,
you might get some private
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
-
-
All right, without any further ado...
...let's all get wet and wild!
-
- I'll show you to your stand.
How you ladies doing? Good? Yeah!
Oh, yeah. Look at this.
Whoa, I'm in love!
Come on, take a photo with me.
Get over here, come over here.
Right here. Come right here.
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, you're beautiful.
You will never drown,
and you're beautiful.
Do a little mouth-to-mouth.
- No way!
-
-  Woo!
-
All right. All right, ladies,
thank you very much.
Good-bye now.
I knew it.
What are you doing
back here, Maddy?
I saw this when I was taking inventory,
but I didn't think to ask
why it was here until now.
We pump our own water now.
Fuck the utilities, right?
You can't fill this water park
off a well.
It's not a standard well.
We drilled down a whole lot further,
hit an underwater lake.
We got enough water to last us
till kingdom come.
- You have no idea what you've done.
- Oh, sure I do.
- Got us a nice big fat profit.
- You don't understand!
You could be pumping piranha straight
through the water intake pipes!
Maddy, it's opening day.
I have shelled out $100,000,
and you want me to close shop
because there might,
just might, be piranha in the pipe?
What else? Ghosts? Bogeymen?
Sharks? Snakes? You're laughable.
Laughable.
Come on, kid.
You've been watching too many
movies, little girl.
- You should read romance novels.
-
Are we done? I got work to do.
- Mommy, I got bit.
- Let me see.
Oh, honey, you just scraped
yourself on something.
Go tell the lifeguard,
he'll get you a Band-Aid.
- No, no, it was a piranis.
- It was not a piranha.
You've heard too many people
talking about piranha. Now scoot.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hey!
- Hey.
I got bit by a piranis.
- What's your name, kid?
- David.
David?
That's pretty cool.
That's my name, too.
- Here you go.
- What...
- What's this?
- It's an autograph.
Can I just have a Band-Aid?
Wait a minute.
- You don't know who I am?
- No.
- You never saw ?
- Mm-mm.
Running in slow motion?
How about
- No.
- Talking car?
?
on Broadway?
- Hey, hey!
- What?
- Mr. Hasselhoff!
- Back off, Toro!
I'm talkin' to my main man here.
Huh? It's OK.
You really have no idea who I am?
Yeah. You're a lifeguard.
And I need a Band-Aid.
Can I get a Band-Aid for my
main man David here, please?
?
I'm just gonna get
a Band-Aid somewhere else.
I'm a lifeguard.
- Are you OK?
- I saw a fish, in the splash pool.
I know this is crazy, but it was
a piranha like the ones on the news.
I swear to God!
Hey! Everybody out of the pool!
Out of the pool!
Hey, hey! You have to get them
out of the pool right now!
Hey! No running!
Game over, Chet. We gotta shut
the water park down right now.
What part of "no fucking way"
don't you hear?
A woman saw a piranha
in the splash pool.
Did you see it?
- Did you see it?
- No, but...
You've got nothing.
That's what but.
I'm evacuating this water park
whether you like it or not.
- Maddy, Maddy, Maddy, Maddy.
- Take care of this, will you?
Chet's right, OK? You're just
gonna cause more panic.
- I'm sorry. Whose side are you on?
- I'm on the side of being calm.
Let's just go check things out, OK?
You don't believe me.
I'm the one who called you
and you don't fucking believe me?
Come on, kids, get out of the pool.
Please, get out of the water park.
Please just get out of the water.
- Hang on, I can't...
-
- I can't let you do that. OK?
- Let go of me!
What the fuck
you doing, man? Let her go.
Hey, what are you gonna do,
Shark Boy? Huh?
Poke me with your fucking trident?
Let me give you a little piece
of advice, buddy.
You're gonna need a bigger one.
Come on!
Oh, my God.
Get out of the water!
Come on, go! Go!
I can't believe it.
They're back! They're back.
They'll find you. They'll always fucking
find you. No matter where you go!
Help!
Bring me my legs.
-
- Titanium, motherfuckers.
Eat this.
-
-
Get out of there!
- I hate the water.
- I hate the fish.
Help me! Help! Help me!
Hey! People are dying!
You're a lifeguard, do something!
I'm not a lifeguard, never was one.
Help! Help me! Help, lifeguard!
There's still kids
going down those slides!
Once these idiots
get out of the water,
it's not as if the fish are
gonna follow them home.
Help me! Help!
Help me!
You went back in the water.
You little ginger moron.
Mitch!
You're a lifeguard, Mitch!
Holy fuck!
I'm getting old.

-
I got ya!
Yeah!
I made a rescue.
I actually made a rescue.
Can you put me down now?
Chet!
- Chet!
-
Do you see 'em?
Do you see 'em now?
We've gotta
drain the pools.
Hey, Barry! Since you can't swim,
I need you to go to the pump house
and force-drain the pools.
- I've never done that before.
- It's easy.
The levers, they're all the way down.
You push 'em straight up.
- OK, got it.
- All right, thank you.
Wait, wait.
I just want you to know
that whatever happens,
I've loved you since seventh grade.
I always will.
I thought you were gay.
Really?
I've gotta get out of here.
It's not my fault.
-
- Ah!
- What the fuck?!
-
- Get off me.
-
Barry, dude, come over here,
please, man!
Look at my ass!
- Holy shit!
- Whatever it is, just get it out!
OK. This is
gonna hurt. Ready?
One, two...
OK, come on!
We gotta get to the pump!
Sorry, kid.
It's not my fault!
-
- Oh, shit!
Move out of the way!
Move it! Move it!
OK, listen. I need you to get
all the first aid supplies
and bring 'em outside.
Got it? You got it, go.
I need first aid.
-  Maddy!
- Ah! Help me!
- Maddy! Maddy! Maddy, come here!
- Help me!
I didn't know.
I promise you, I didn't know.
- What are you talking about?
- The well.
Chet promised me that he'd
give me 35 percent of the profits
if I turned a blind eye.
Just help me.
Get me out of here, please!
- I didn't know that...
- Kyle, please!
- Please, just help me!
- The blood.
- Help me!
- The blood!
- Kyle, please!
- I can't. I can't do this.
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, don't, don't!
Please help me!
- Where's Maddy? Where's Maddy?!
- She's gone, I couldn't save her!
- Help me! Help!
- Maddy! Maddy!
OK...
Be a man, Kyle.
Be a man. Be a man.
Be a man, Kyle!
Maddy!
Oh, I can't swim! Help!
Oh!
This was a bad idea.
Barry?
Save a life, save a life.
Save a life, Kyle.
Be the hero!
I got you! Oh, my God!
Get out of the pool!
Oh, my God!
Medic!
I need a medic!
Maddy!
Maddy.
Nobody munches
on Big Dave's ass, bitch!
Woo hoo-hoo-hoo!
How the hell did you buy
that shotgun leg?
With the money I saved on socks.
-
- Maddy!
You're not gonna believe this.
I was right.
They're evolving.
They're learning to walk.
Yeah, I know.
David!
David! Get away from that thing!
Mom, it's OK.
They're slow on land.
Oh, my God!
Little ginger moron.

Fuck me.
Fish hunter!
Can we get a little tighter?

Right, either that or I was gonna wait
for the drums to come and...

You ginger little moron.

The camera, where is it?
There it is.
Action.
Action.
We're the place with no fish...
Oh, here we go again.
One, two, three, ready?
We're the place with no fish,
but plenty of tail.
Piranha? What?
That's the wrong place to put it, right?
OK, here we go, once again.
What's the line?
Come on down and cool off
at the hottest hole in town.
- Ready? Come on down...

Are you serious? $15! $15!
Are you serious? Film him now!
- Do you want me to start with it out?
- It was 3 double-D!
How the hell did they get in here?
Even if they're the same grizzly bears?
- Winky face!
- I hate you both.
I'm OK with that.
- Oh!
-
Give me five, brother.
- Who's that?
- My mom.
- She's kind of cute.
- Yeah, she's got some talent.
- She what?
- She has some talent.
- She what?
- She has some talent.
Your mom has talent? Wow.
She's pretty hot.
Yeah, don't even try it.
Best sticks in the business.
# Years ago... #
I'm wet all the time.
You wanna get wetter,
come on down and cool off

Mine! Ooh, that won't make the movie.
We should add that to the movie.

What are you doing?
Wha... Oh, my God,
you're not Dawn.

The Hoff in bed.
That's why
I'm in this wheelchair.
Guys, we're rolling.
Camera is rolling.
We are set.
Let's do this thing.
For God's sakes, watch the...
