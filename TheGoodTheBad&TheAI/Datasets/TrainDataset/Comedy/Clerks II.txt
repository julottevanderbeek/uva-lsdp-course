Yeah, I got a fire
at the Quick Stop.
Yeah.
Terrorists?
I left the coffee pot
on again, didn't I?
Shit!
Now where am I gonna
bring chicks to fuck
when my mom's home?
# Here we stand #
# Like an Adam and an Eve #
# Waterfalls #
# The Garden of Eden #
# Two fools in love #
# So beautiful... #
So, ready for your big last day?
I am.
When do you and your old lady
head down to Florida?
Tomorrow morning.
Car's all packed up.
You gonna do anything crazy
before you leave
New Jersey forever?
How long have you known me?
If I were you,
I'd spray-paint "eat pussy"
across the side of the building
in huge letters.
Why?
Let 'em know
you were there, man.
I'd rather let them know
I'm not an asshole.
Too late for that.
I'm really gonna miss you, man.
# Hey #
# Once there were parking lots #
# Now it's a peaceful oasis #
# You've got it, you've got it #
# This was a Pizza Hut #
# Now it's all covered
with daisies #
# You've got it, you've got it #
# I miss the honky-tonks,
Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens #
# You've got it, you've got it #
# And as things fell apart #
# Nobody paid much attention #
# You've got it, you've got it #
# Years ago #
# I was an angry young man... #
I can't believe they haven't
done anything with it yet.
The Lord did
something with it.
He smited that hellhole.
Listen to you.
Do you mean to tell me
you don't miss
that place at all?
:
God, no.
Do you?
Of course not.
# I wish I had a lawnmower #
# You've got it, you've got it #
##
##
##
# I dream of cherry pies #
# Candy bars
and chocolate chip cookies #
# You've got it, you've got it #
# Don't leave me stranded here #
# I can't get used
to this lifestyle. #
# Grandma, what was it like #
# To be on that holiday site? #
Get the fuck out of here!
# Grandma said, "Do come in,
my little friend." #
You know, sometimes I wish
I did a little more with my life
instead of hanging out in front
of places selling weed and shit.
Like, maybe be an animal doctor.
Why not me?
I like seals and shit.
Or maybe an astronaut.
Yeah.
Like, be the first motherfucker
to see a new galaxy
or find
a new alien life-form...
and fuck it.
And people'd be like,
"There he goes.
Homeboy fucked a Martian once."
Holy shit.
Our first customer
since our triumphant return.
Act cool.
Hold on.
Yeah, you guys holdin'?
Shit, everything but coke,
heroin and your cock.
What?
How about a nickel bag, man?
:
Oh, 15 bucks, little man.
Put that shit in my hand.
# Nong, nong, nagga-
nagga-nong-nong. #
He likes to sing.
So, uh, I haven't seen
you guys in a while, man.
Where you been all this time?
Me and Silent Bob
finally bought a car,
we're cruising down
to the Boardwalk...
fucking Middletown cop
pulls us over
for Suspicion of Mischief.
What the fuck does that mean?
We were driving around
with a deployed airbag.
The cops pull us over.
They find two pounds
of Jamaican lambswool.
Prosecutor wants
to put us away for a dime,
but the judge gives us
rehab instead.
Shit, rehab?
Yup-yup.
How long were you in?
JAY:
Six months, sir.
We got six months
and two days on the wagon
as a good friend of Bill W.'s.
Check it out.
Just got it two days ago,
before we got out.
Yeah, but if you're holding
all the time,
aren't you gonna be tempted
to get high?
Oh, not with the power
of Christ on my side, sir.
Is that a fuckin' Bible?
Hey, hey,
the Holy fuckin' Bible, son!
What the fuck kind
of songbird Jesus-freak dealer
did you bring me to?
: I like them, man.
They're funny.
They're fuckin' stupid.
You should read your Bible,
sirs.
You'll find all types
of weird shit in there.
Like, did you know
Jesus was a Jew?
Yeah.
I need two Egga-Mooby Muffins,
and we're almost out
of hash browns.
Hold on.
Now, Randal!
What are you writing
over there, anyway,
your memoirs?
I'm battling
this jackass
on his blog's message board.
About what?
On how he's got
too much free time and no life.
So does the guy who's
flaming him on his Web site.
I can't help it.
The guy pisses me off.
It's this fuck in a wheelchair
that's always preying
on everyone's sympathies,
writing these long diatribes
about how he'll never walk again
and how walkers should
appreciate the blessings
of their functioning legs.
That diatribe, as you call it,
sounds like
some poor crippled guy
pouring out his heart
and feelings.
Oh, fuck him, man.
Trying to guilt me
into walking around more
because he's all gimped out?
What kind of mind-fuck
is that shit?
So I've been getting
into it with him,
throwing it back
in his stupid crippy-boy face
about how I love
to just sit around
and how I'd rather drive to
the end of the block than walk.
The guy's in a wheelchair.
Yeah. That's why
I called him crippy-boy.
Have a good one.
You fuckin' freak.
I'm not even gonna point out
the irony here.
What's the matter with you?
What'd I do now?
There's a crippled guy
who found a way
to reach out to a world
he feels isolated from,
and you somehow found a
way to take issue with him.
Sure, take his side.
Have you become so embittered
that you now feel the need
to attack the handicapped?
What handicap?
The guy's
just in a wheelchair.
It's not like
he's Anne Frank or something.
Anne Frank?
Yeah, Anne Frank,
the chick that was all...
...till the miracle worker
showed up
and knocked
some smarts into her.
:
You're talking
about Helen Keller.
No, I'm not.
I'm talking about Anne Frank.
She was deaf, dumb and blind.
No, she wasn't.
Helen Keller was
deaf, dumb and blind.
Are you sure?
Yup.
Then who the fuck's Anne Frank?
Anne Frank's
the little Jewish girl
who hid from the Nazis
in a secret room
with her family.
She wrote a diary.
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, I guess
this guy is like Anne Frank,
what with the diary, you know?
No, he's like Helen Keller
with the handicap, you jerk!
You always got to be right,
don't you?
You Nazi douche bag.
What? What do you want?
No, we don't serve Cow Tippers
in the morning.
Freedom Toast is a possibility.
##
Oh, we totally do.
All right, that'll be $12.64.
Avert your eyes, you perv.
That's not very hygienic.
That's all I'm gonna tell you.
Emma, are you like this
'cause you have an
unnaturally large clit?
You just had to tell him,
didn't you?
It kind of came out one day.
He says it's so big,
it's almost like
a little cock...
which says all kinds
of weird things about him
that I don't even want
to think about.
You wouldn't want
to be with a girl
with an oversized clit?
No, 'cause the next stop is
a guy with an undersized dick.
##
You're a little hard.
'Cause you're
a little close to me.
I can pull back, if you want.
Can we pull back into our
own apartment in Florida again?
Really? Goddamn it, Dante.
How many times
are we gonna have
this fucking conversation?
There is no point
in getting an apartment anymore.
My mother has
pretty much told us
that she's gonna get us
a house as a wedding gift.
Your parents' generosity
just makes me
a little uncomfortable, Em.
They're giving us a house.
Your dad's giving me
one of his car washes to run.
It just feels weird.
Babe, it just feels weird
because you're so used
to life shitting
on you all the time.
What the fuck does that mean?
All I'm saying is that suddenly,
you have a woman that loves you,
a new job opportunity
and a fantastic life
to look forward to, right?
You got to face it, tiger:
You hit the jackpot.
RANDAL:
What's up?
Something wrong?
RANDAL:
Nope.
Just saw you guys talking.
Thought I'd come out here
and join you.
God, it must be
nice to have a job
with so much downtime.
Downtime's important.
If I had to deal with all
the fucking mouth-breathers
nonstop, without a break,
I'd put my head
in the deep fryer.
Balls, too.
Do you really want
to sit here and watch me
and my fiancé make out?
- Are you that much of a loser?
- Not really.
I was actually gonna ask
you two to knock it off
while I was out here.
I don't fucking understand
why you can't be happy
for your best friend.
He finally found a woman
who loves him.
Like you even register
as a chick to me.
You might as well be a dude.
Really?
Yeah. You're
my best friend's girlfriend.
You became
persona non-nookie to me
the moment he started diddling
your pooter.
So thinking of me
in terms of being a girl
kind of creeps you out,
does it?
Sweetheart, I don't think
of you in terms of being a girl.
I don't think of you
in any way...
Oh, that was just wrong.
If you don't get
the fuck out of here
so that I can spend
some quality time with my man,
next, I'm gonna show you
my pooter.
Why would you want
to do something like that?
All right, all right,
I'm leaving!
Jesus!
What'd you do that for?
You realize he just
thinks you're trying
to get him into a three-way
with us now, don't you?
EMMA: Yeah, right.
With Graves?
That man's a total fucking
Lloyd, like most Jersey guys.
Hey!
You talk tough, but when
we're crossing the state line,
I bet you get all sentimental
for Jersey
and squirt a few tears.
Yeah, tears of joy, maybe.
Jersey sucks,
and we are surrounded by morons.
On that note, I'm gonna go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're leaving?
EMMA:
Yeah, I've got
a ton of stuff to do
before we leave in the morning,
but I love you.
I love you, too.
:
Bye.
Dude, I'm pretty sure
your old lady wants
to get you and me together
in a three-way.
Ow.
Dude, how old are you?
You know I'm 19, Randal.
You wouldn't work for me
last week, remember?
'Cause you said working
on my birthday
would help me build character.
Well, at least you spelled
"cock" right this time.
Why the fuck are you
still getting rides
from your mother?
And even worse,
what the fuck are you
kissing her good-bye for?
What is she,
your fuckin' prom date?
You're not gonna bother me
today, Randal.
I'm in too good a mood.
Because your mom
slipped you the tongue?
No, because I just read online
that there's gonna be
a live-action
Transformers movie.
And?
Well... I mean, as you know,
my online handle
is Optimus Prime.
I know that.
I wish I didn't.
Well, so not only is it awesome
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,
but I'm, like,
positioned or whatever
with the best possible
Net handle and e-mail address
for when the movie comes out.
Oh, you're gonna be rolling
in the pussy, man.
Don't be gross.
Says the guy
who was just playing
tonsil hockey with his mother.
Mr. Dante!
Leave Elias alone, Randal!
Don't look at his wee-wee.
Dude, the Transformers sucked.
Oh, no, they didn't.
They were more
than meets the eye.
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right
- about that or not.
- Ow.
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks
that turn into...
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,
because my pastor says
that machines can turn
into other machines,
and it's not a sleight
against God.
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,
and all we did to pay him back
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.
Nice shot.
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...
I mean, I don't know,
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...
Well, okay...
Bible camp?!
Since God created...
Since God created man,
and man created
the Transformers...
...the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.
They are an unholy curse
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.
The first of the fallen,
the spoiler of virgins,
the master of abortions!
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

# Let me help you #
# Out of your chair, Grandma! #
# Grandma, what was it like #
# To be on that holiday site? #
# Late that night,
I awoke from my sleep #
# Hearing unknown voices #
JAY/RANDAL:
# Laughing insane... #
:
Oh...
##
Oh, what the fuck was that?
What?
That wave.
I saw Becky, so I waved.
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.
And?
And you've got to greet her
before she gets in here,
you fuckin' ass-kiss?
What's that all about?
It's called friendship.
She's your boss.
You can't be friends
with your boss.
No, you can't be friends
with your boss.
I like my boss.
I think there's
something going on
between you two.
You're crazy.
You spend an awful lot
of time talking to her.
I spend an awful lot of time
talking to you, too.
And I've always maintained
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.
We're just friends.
That's what I keep telling you.
No, you idiot, me and Becks.
"Becks"?
I knew it.
You're fucking
around with the boss.
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancée.
Why would you want
to fuck around
with a chick your own age, man?
If you've got to sow
some of your wild oats,
there's all
these fine young chicks
that stop in here after school.
First off, I'm not cheating
on my fiancée.
Secondly, if I was cheating
on my fiancée,
it wouldn't be with a teenager.
Why not?
The best part of this job
is all the barely-legal pussy
that comes in here.
And they all look up to me,
'cause I've got
a driver's license.
It's awesome.
You're 33.
You show me one
who's as buck-wild in bed
as her 17-year-old
counterpart.
nowadays are crazy.
They're up for anything.
They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.
Oh... my... God.
What?
Are you serious?
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.
It's never my idea.
These young girls today
get all horned up,
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.
You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!
You sound like my mom.
Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?
You never go ass to mouth.
You've never gone ass to mouth?
You never go ass to mouth.
I've never gone ass to mouth.
Not even once?
Not even ever.
You're both so repressed.
All right, look,
I know you've given
a blow job, right?
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.
That's a yes.
And I know you've
gone down on chicks.
What's your point?
Well,
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?
That's just like going
ass to mouth.
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.
:
And?
Have you restocked
all the napkin holders yet?
That's an Elias job.
That comparison
of pink and brown eyes
just made it a Randal job.
ELIAS:
Zing!
Shut the fuck up, GoBot.
I could probably sue
this whole corporation right now
for sexual harassment.
You're just making me
restock the napkin holders
because of my firmly held
beliefs
on the subject of ass to mouth.
You never go ass to mouth!
Would you grow up?
: All right,
I'm gonna tell you this
'cause we're friends...
but sometimes,
in the heat of the moment,
it's forgivable
to go ass to mouth.
I knew it.
I'm fuckin' bored, man!
And boredom's the first step
on the road to relapse.
Oh!
##
Would you fuck me?
I'd fuck me.
I'd fuck me hard.
# Ooh, ooh... ooh, ooh... #
Shit.
Well, hello, Miss Scott.
Well, here he is,
the escape artist.
I'm not gone yet.
Please. You've been
gone for the last month.
When do you guys leave?
Well, we start driving
tomorrow morning.
Oh, uh, I left you
the forwarding address
for my last check
on the calendar there.
So you did.
That's her parents' house,
right?
Yes, but only until the wedding.
And then, from what I hear,
her parents
are giving us a house.
Nice!
So I guess dowries
are making a comeback.
Oh, yeah.
Her dad sweetened the pot
with two fatted calves
and a goat.
I'm gonna miss you, Hicks.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.
I still can't believe
you're just gonna leave
me alone in this place...
with Randal Graves,
of all people.
Quit.
Move to Florida.
You could work
at the car wash with me.
Wow, you make it
sound so tempting.
How can I say no?
Oh, yeah... 'cause it's a
fucking car wash in Florida.
Like it's any worse
than this place.
Hurl the insults
all you want, buddy man.
As soon as my uncle's
on his feet again,
it's not like I'm
gonna be staying here.
- Hey, how's he doing?
- A lot better.
It only took two years
and a shitload of chemo,
but... his red cell count's
almost back to normal.
That's great.
Yeah, it's great for me, too.
Couple of weeks
in this crap shack
turned into a couple of
years a little too quickly.
But, Hicks, we can sit here
making small talk
about your last day
and what it is I'm going
to do once you're gone,
or we can treat this
like any other workday.
Ding-a-ling-a-ling!
Randal.
One ring to rule them all.
And you wonder why no chick'll
let you stick your cock in her.
I never wondered that.
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted
the fact
that you'll never get a chick
a long time ago.
I could get a chick if I wanted.
:
Who are you kidding?
You can't get a chick, you mook.
You're too weird and sad.
I turn down chicks
left and right.
Your chicks
your "left" and "right."
Yeah, right.
What do you know?
Uh, I know
you're a huge fuckin' nerd
of Potsie-like proportions,
and no chicks dig nerds,
especially nerds that are
into
Chicks dig
Randal.
Yeah. The kind of chicks
that are into swords
and elves and shit,
and I wouldn't fuck them
with the Torch of Gondor.
Oh, you're so gross!
Hey, man.
Welcome to Mooby's.
May I take your order?
Yeah, um...
let's see.
Give me one Udderly
Delicious Moo-ilk Shake,
Skinny Calf and an order
of onion rings. Thanks.
"One ring to rule them all."
"One ring to find them."
Oh, Jesus.
"One ring to bring them all."
"And in the darkness bind them."
Yes! Dude!
How many times?
Well, um, three
for
two for
four for
Five for
Dude!
All right, look,
there's only one
and it ain't of the king...
it's of the Jedi.
Oh,  geek.
Oh, I'm the geek?
Look at you two,
whipping out your preciouses.
You'll have to excuse him.
He's not "down"
with the trilogy.
Oh, what the fuck happened
to this world?
There's only one trilogy,
you fucking morons.
You know what?
Maybe we should start
calling your friend Padme,
because he loves
Mannequin Skywalker
so much, right?
:
"Danger, danger.
"My name is Anakin.
My shitty acting
is ruining saga."
: Yeah.
Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.
Oh, I'm crazy?
Those fucking hobbit movies
were boring as hell.
All it was
was a bunch of people walking.
Three movies of people walking
to a fuckin' volcano.
Here's the first movie.
And here's the second movie.
He is way off. Loser.
You ready for the third movie?
Fuckin' A.
Even the fuckin' trees walked
in those movies.
You know what?
I've had enough of you.
Your simplistic analysis
of the trilogy aside,
was a massive achievement that
even the Academy recognized
when they gave Peter Jackson
the Best Directing Oscar...
an award your little friend
George "Toy Boy" Lucas has never
and will never win.
Bones.
Oh, sick burn.
Let me tell you something.
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one
on the logical closure point,
not the 25 endings
that followed.
What's the logical
closure point?
Yeah, friend,
enlighten us.
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,
and Sam leans in the doorway
and gives him
that very fuckin' gay look.
ELIAS:
Not the
Say what you will about Jesus,
but leave the  out of this.
I am gonna kick your ass
back to the Shire
if you don't
shut your fuckin' mouth.
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell
the little hobbits
to take a walk
so he could saunter
over to Frodo
and suck his fuckin' cock.
Now,  would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.
Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,
right before the credits roll,
Sam fucking flat-out bricks
in Frodo's mouth.
I swear...
Fuck you!
: I made fun of
so hard,
it made some super-geek puke
all over the counter.
Where do we keep
the mop and bucket
so I can have
Elias clean it up?
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.
We have cleaning products?
Why does it smell so weird
in here?
Buh-bye.
I'm on to you.
You know he's not
gonna make it here long
once you're not here to protect
him anymore, don't you?
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,
advocating ass to mouth.
I wasn't advocating it,
you big prude.
I just said it was fine
once in a while.
Like you wouldn't do it
if Emma told you to.
:
Christ, no!
Oh, I thought love
knew no bounds.
Ew. That came off
kind of catty, didn't it?
A little daytime soapish, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I actually kind of like Emma.
So do I.
So that's why
you're getting married!
I can't wait until
you get engaged,
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.
You're going to be waiting
a long time, sir.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
You're the cold-hearted
ice princess
that doesn't believe
in marriage.
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,
but, yes, I do think
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.
To be loved?
To fuck as much as possible...
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies
and greeting cards
is just propaganda
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.
You're such a sappy girl.
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?
In romantic love,
no.
Like, I love my parents.
I love my car.
I love you.
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,
"There's only one person
out there for me"?
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?
Odds are there's always going
to be someone who's
a better match for you
than the person
you end up marrying.
So based on your theory,
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.
Wait a second.
You don't think
I really love her?
:
I think...
you love what she represents.
Which is...?
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you
the time of day
back in high school.
And years later,
after she's played the field
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...
Oh, my God,
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?
Unconventional!
Ah, nice backpedal.
Thank you.
It took her a few years
to finally figure out
that thing
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl
but she has to learn on her own,
and that's that guys
that look like you
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always
try harder than the pretty boy.
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?
:
No, you're a catch... kind of.
And Emma's a catch, too.
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...
she'll make all your decisions
for you.
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible
at making decisions.
So my last day
is all about you telling me
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop
for, like, a decade,
and you've been here
for a year almost,
and since day one at both jobs,
all you've ever said
is how you needed
to get out
and start your life.
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,
"and I'll fuck your brains out,
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"
that you actually went
and did something about it.
And I get it... it's...
she's your golden ticket, dude.
So, uh...
...what's that make you?
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.
:
That's me.
DJ:
That's something for
the lovers out there.
J-RAM Radio.
Right around high noon...
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?
What is there to say?
Do you regret it?
Do you?
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.
Yeah, you regret it...
you weren't the one
who got mayo in your cooch.
What do you want me to say?
We were drunk, you know?
It just kind of happened.
You're just lucky
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.
Dude, your old lady's out here
looking for you.
:
Yeah.
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.
That's my surprise?
No.
# Goodbye, horses... #
Hey.
Oh.
So, um...
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?
Because at CarsToBots. com,
you can get an avatar
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.
Come on, man.
You know I only surf
Transformers sites
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.
So what are you doing then?
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.
Really?
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?
What?
Uh...
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?
A donkey show.
What's that?
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?
:
Oh, no!
Shh!
Jesus!
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.
You gonna keep your mouth shut?
:
Yes.
God.
That's bestiality, Randal.
At its finest, I hope.
Who'd want to see
something like that?
Me, Dante, you.
I don't want to see
something like that.
Why would you want to see
something like that?
Because it's fucked up.
And I want to see
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.
All right, here we go.
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,
"Kelly's taking it on the road.
Taking it in the ass, that is."
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.
Do they show pictures?
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.
Really?
Ow.
Let me borrow your cellphone.
Whoa.
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.
This is an emergency.
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?
In a non-gay way.
Then give me your phone.
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.
Hello.
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.
Tonight.
Okay.
I'm on hold.
Fingers crossed.
We should probably
cross dicks, too.
No.
BECKY:
Work, work, work.
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.
Hey, Becks.
Hey, Emma.
Great shirt.
Isn't it?
I love it.
What I love even more are these.
These came in early,
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.
And give you yours, of course.
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.
What is it?
Look, I know it's
three months away,
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.
Well... yeah.
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there
before we picked a date.
Oh, him is so cute.
Him thinking again, huh?
If we left anything
up to these jackals,
nothing would ever
get done, would it?
I'm just teasing.
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.
All right, I've got it.
I will see you then.
Thank you.
My friend, tonight,
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?
Strangely, no.
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,
you've seen them all.
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics
of anything like that?
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?
Ho-ly shit.
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.
You're a virgin, aren't you?
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.
Oh, yeah.
What's her name again?
Myra Hodgkiss.
You made her up, didn't you?
That name sounds so made-up.
No.
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.
Come on!
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.
I let you smell my fingers
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister
in the office
that one time, didn't I?
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.
Maybe you're all about the cock.
No, no, I like the pussy.
So come on.
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,
but she can't.
Why?
Jesus, Elias, come on.
You got to start
trusting me more.
Because once Dante's gone,
you're gonna be
my new best friend.
No, I'm not.
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.
So come on.
You got to start
trusting me more.
Open up and tell me shit.
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?
Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.
Duh.
You know
how every girl's parents
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young
to keep them from having
premarital sex?
Sure.
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,
Pillow Pants will bite it off.
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday
before we can have sex.
And Myra told you this?
Boyfriends and girlfriends
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?
Women.
I'll be right back.
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.
Look who it is, Randal.
Randal Graves.
You work here, too?
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...
Pickle Fucker.
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.
Nothing's changed.
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,
when you two aren't fighting
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,
you can still muster up
enough energy
to make fun of other people.
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,
so we can make fun of you.
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.
flipping burgers?
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop
for, what, like, ten years?
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.
Who's an Internet millionaire?
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.
We went to high school together.
A few years ago,
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices
of merchandise
you can buy online.
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts.com.
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.
You see, freshman year,
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through
what they called initiations.
They'd stuff us into lockers
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.
But Lance here
got the worst of it.
The seniors yanked
down his pants,
and shoved a pickle up his ass,
and made him walk ten feet.
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.
Ew...
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged
after only four bites.
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world
who still remembers that,
Graves.
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...
Pickle Fucker.
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest
in building
the ultimate fan site
for both
and
Because I'd moderate it
for free.
Ease up, Pillow Pants.
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't insult the guy.
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.
Thank you!
I keep telling them that.
Here, here's my e-mail address.
Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.
Cool.
LANCE:
Okay, let's see.
What do I want?
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?
I'll get your order.
Here you go.
Well, that was fast.
And fresh.
Thanks. Come again.
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.
You know what?
Take mine.
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!
You know,
I don't eat fast food.
It's not good for you.
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,
well, I just had
to see it for myself.
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know
that some things never change.
Take care, clerks.
Ooh, sick burn.
Fuck this.
Let me borrow your car.
You're supposed to be working.
I got to get out of here
for a few minutes.
Let me borrow your car.
Elias, tell Becky
we'll be right back.
Where we going?
You know, this tastes like
piss and flies, don't it?
Sure you want to do this?
RANDAL:
Oh, yeah.
This will make me feel better.
# Raindrops keep falling
on my head #
# And just like the guy who's
feet are too big for his bed #
# Nothing seems to fit,
those #
# Raindrops
are falling on my head #
# They keep falling #
# But there's one thing I know #
# The blues
they send to meet me #
# Won't defeat me #
# It won't be long #
# Till happiness
steps up to greet me #
# Raindrops keep falling
on my head #
# But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turning red #
# Crying's not for me,
'cause #
# I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complaining #
