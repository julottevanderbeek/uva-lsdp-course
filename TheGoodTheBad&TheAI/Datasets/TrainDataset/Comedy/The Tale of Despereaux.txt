Ohhh.
First of all,
rats hate the light.
They spend their
lives in the darkness.
Ooh!
And as far as telling
the truth is concerned,
Tell me that thing again, please.
Come on.
Just once, I promise.
Tell me one more time,
and I won't ask you ever again. I swear.
Fine. We are headed to Dor,
one of the most
magical places in the whole world.
No, that's not what you said before.
You know, every place
has something special.
And, in Dor, it's the soup!
SAILOR: Land ho!
Ohhh.
SAILOR 1: It's down below, I tell you.
SAILOR 2: Give it a heave.
I can see it!
Ooh, I can smell it! I can smell it.
ROSCURO: Oh, I can't wait
to taste the soup!
Just stay close.
We leave again at 6:00.
You know, we ought to think
about staying here just a little longer.
Don't even think about it.
Remember Shanghai?
Yeah, but this place is different.
I mean, this is special.
was almost like
having a full meal.
But on one very
special day every year,
but it was nothing
compared to Soup Day.
Watch it, watch it.
Incoming potatoes!
Hurry! Hurry! Excuse us.
because they knew that,
at that very moment,
DELIVERY MAN: Potatoes coming up!
COOK 1: Let's go!
COOK 2: Don't forget the parsley!
COOK 1: Make sure it's clean!
he would unveil that
year's royal creation.
More onions!
More onions!
More onions!
More onions!
- Ohhh!
- Ow!
Sorry.
Wow.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure to announce
this year's royal creations
from the kitchens of Chef Andre.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Something is wrong.
I need more time!
But we're late already!
This is not right!
Everyone out!
Out!
In fact, sometimes,
it takes a little help.
You changed something.
You're crazy. I did not touch it.
- I can smell it.
- Hmm?
- What's this?
- What?
- This!
- Ow! Garlic.
- Garlic.
- Yeah, a little garlic.
- It was already there.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- Not this much!
Ow!
You ruined my soup!
I save your soup!
Those people wait all year,
and you want to give them this dishwater.
Dishwater?
Dishwater.
Dishwater?
Ow! Cut it out!
And this year's soup is
a spring tureen
with a
of roasted vegetables...
Oh.
...fresh herbs...
- Mmm!
...and wild mushrooms.
Oh.
Roscuro?
Roscuro?
Oh. Evening.
CHEF ANDRE: I don't have to stand here
and listen to a big talking garbage can!
BOLDO: Ha! And I don't have
to stand here and listen to a coward!
- Coward?
- Yes, a coward!
- You call me coward?
- Yes!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That did it.
- Hmm?
- Mmm.
BOTH: Mmm!
- It's
Roscuro! Roscuro, where are you?
Ohhh.
Whoa!
This is amazing!
CHEF ANDRE: Wait till
Your Highness tastes it.
Hmm?
QUEEN: This is...
Whoa!
...absolutely...
Oh, it moved! My soup moved!
No, it isn't... It did not move.
Oh, Your Highness.
- Ahhh!
- Darling?
Oh! A rat! There's a rat in my soup!
Madam, I know that this is unfortunate.
And I know that
while on first glance, I might...
- A rat! In my soup!
- No. Please. Shh, shh, shh.
- And I ate it!
- Your Highness, hold on...
- Uh-oh.
- She's right! It's a rat!
- Please...
- Ahhh! It's a rat!
Get me that rat!
Now, I really believe
you're jumping to conclusions.
And I'm sure that the
rats you met last time
might have caused you
to create a stereotype,
but... But I... But...
It's just... I'm just...
I'm not really from around here.
I'm... I'm from... Oh...
Oh!
That's very aggressive.
GUARD: Get him!
Kitchen...
He's going into the kitchen!
Oh!
GUARD: Over there!
Stop that rat!
Whoa!
GUARD: I got him!
Uh-oh.
He's going near the soup!
GUARD: There he is!
lf... If I could just tell...
GUARD: On the kettle!
That's him, right there!
Look, up there!
Sweetie? Darling?
She's... She's...
She's...
Blimey, she's dead. Get him!
GUARD: Don't let him escape!
We'll get you, you rowdy rat!
Oh!
No, no, no!
No, not there!
You don't need to be afraid.
I know it's dark,
but you'll get used to it.
Who... Who are you?
Just a rat, like you.
Come with me.
NARRATOR: When something hurts
this much, there must be a reason.
"From this moment on, soup,
"the making of soup,
the selling of soup, or the eating of soup,
"is hereby outlawed
in the kingdom of Dor!
"Rats are to be
considered illegal as well
"and are hereby deemed

"From this moment on,

You may as well
make flies illegal.
Sunlight left and
the world went gray.
And for a long time,
it wouldn't rain.
I wish it would rain.
You and the whole world, madam.
Ow!
Oh, sorry, milady!
Well, at least I can still feel that.
Louise, do you think
there's a bit of light
somewhere in the world?
Don't know, ma'am.
I think there is.
You just need to know where to find it.
Well, if you know
anything about fairytales,
you know that a
hero doesn't appear
MOUSE: Oh, look out!
Alms for the blind! Alms for the blind!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Tilling?
- Oh!
Mr. Mayor, hello!
Where are you going?
Oh, well,
my baby is having a...
No, my wife is having a...
Oh, right. Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, I... I really... Goodbye.
His eyes are open.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes they are.
But he isn't cowering.
He's looking right at us.
Don't worry. He'll learn to cower.
They all do in time.
ANTOINETTE: But he isn't!
Wow! He's so puny!
And look at those ears!
NARRATOR: And,
from the very beginning,
Despereaux, don't do it.
MOUSE 1: Don't look. Don't look!
MOUSE 2: I won't, I won't.
Mmm.
He wasn't just small
in human terms.
We're worried about him.
He doesn't scurry. He doesn't cower.
At first, we thought he would
grow out of it, but...
Well, he scurries sometimes.
But not when he's scared!
He just does it for fun.
And he never cowers.
We've showed him how, but he...
Well, some kids are slower than others.
He'll cower in time. We'll work on it.
- Yes, but...
- It'll be fine, I promise.
All right, settle down.
Ready, class?
Good.
ALL: Mmm! Ah!
Good. Excellent.
- Despereaux!
- Yes?
You didn't cower.
Looks like a sword.
It's a carving knife.
It's beautiful!
It's dangerous.
Do you have anymore?
Despereaux, what are you doing?
We're not even supposed to be here.
That's the dungeon.
They have rats down there.
And they'll eat you.
And pull your arms off!
How far down is it?
I don't know. No one's ever come back.
How come?
'Cause... 'Cause...
'Cause that's where
you go when you get...
When you get...
Banished.
What do you get banished for?
Oh, you know.
- Rules and...
- Breaking.
- We can't even...
- Talk about it...
- Because...
- That's one of the...
ALL: Rules!
MOUSE 1: Despereaux!
I just want to have a quick look.
We got to get out of here!
MOUSE 1: Oh, gosh.
MOUSE 2: Oh, no.
ALL: Oh, jeez.
Uh-oh.
Despereaux! You can't feed them.
Hello?
Here you go, whoever you are.
Nice.
You are crazy!
What I say? I said nothing!
Well, you heard exactly what I said.
- I say you crazy.
- No, no, no, no!
RAT: Hurry!
SMUDGE: Ha! They look hungry, sir.
Mmm-hmm.
Dinnertime.
You're not eating.
Uh, I was.
No, you weren't.
Well, I'm just watching, sir.
Well, that's not very grateful of you
after I've taken you under my wing.
Well, I'm grateful, really.
I am.
You miss something, don't you?
Uh, no, I don't.
There's nothing up there, Roscuro.
Nothing at all.
Oh, no, I know that! Absolutely.
Uh, nothing!
Nothing. Nothing at all.
He's a tough one.
You're not gonna turn him.
Nah, you're not.
Oh, I don't know. A rat is a rat.
It doesn't really matter
where you come from.
ROSCURO: I'm sorry.
MOUSE: He is so weird.
No kidding.
That is so beautiful.
I wonder what's out there.
"February 1: Doesn't scurry.
"February 3: Didn't cower.
"Didn't cower. Didn't cower.
"Wouldn't scurry."
Oh, here's one:
"Drew pictures of cats on his notebook."
- No! Cats?
- Oh! I can't imagine!
I'm afraid so. Named it Fluffy.
- Oh, I had no idea!
- Oh! That's terrible.
- Despereaux.
- Yes, sir?
Come in, please.
Despereaux, why do you think
you're in school?
To learn?
- To learn, yes.
- Yes.
To learn what?
To learn
how to be a mouse, sir.
That is correct.
And you can't be a mouse if
you don't learn to be afraid.
Oh, Despereaux, this...
There's so many
wonderful things in life to be afraid of
if you'd just learn how scary they are.
Yes. Yes, sir.
How about his brother?
His brother? What about him?
Yes, is he, you know, timid?
Oh! Oh, yes!
- Yes, very timid.
- Yes. So timid!
As timid as the day is long.
Good. Good.
Sometimes they just need
to see the older ones do it.
No one starts out afraid.
- Understood.
- Of course.
- You coddle that boy, that's the problem.
- No.
- Yes, you do.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do. You've been doing it for years.
- He was always...
He's little. I've had to help him.
He's not going to be afraid unless
you allow him to be afraid.
Well, Furlough will teach him.
Do what he does.
And don't do anything he doesn't.
And if he's afraid of something...
Then you need to be afraid of it, too.
Oh!
Wow.
Come on, Furlough, hurry up!
Whoa...
FURLOUGH: All right, now, you start
nibbling right along that edge there.
The glue is all right,
but it's the pages that taste the best.
Hmm. "Once upon a time."
That's great, isn't it?
"Upon a time."
And they don't even tell you
what time that is yet.
It's like you have to find that out.
You're not supposed to read it, Despereaux.
You're supposed to eat it.
Good. I'll come back in an hour.
And no reading! It's a rule.
Hmm. Fair.
But in a cruel and
frightened world,
built on courage and
chivalry and honor.
They pledged their
lives to each other.
To fight for truth,
to defend the weak,
LESTER: How was the library?
Fine.
Spoil your appetite?
No. Helped it, actually.
Made me hungrier.
Good lad.
Ha-hah!
Did you see they're putting up
a new front on the crumb shop?
ANTOINETTE: Oh! But I loved the old front.
LESTER: Quite modern. Yes.
NARRATOR: Did a book
ever speak to you?
Almost like it was
written for you?
The truth, the justice,
the bravery,
He even loved things
you wouldn't suspect.
you're never really
anybody's prisoner.
Someday, my prince will come.
Yeah, how did she know that?
DESPEREAUX: Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?
Down here.
Are you a rat?
No.
What are you? A mouse?
I am a gentleman.
And how do you do?
You're sad.
Yes.
Because you have longing.
You're a strange little mouse.
Thank you.
Come on.
Where did you hear that?
About the longing.
In a story.
A story? About what?
About a princess, like you,
in a castle, like this.
Oh. You're a smooth little mouse,
aren't you?
Bet you tell that to all the princesses.
I am sworn to tell the truth.
It is a code of honor.
Ah. Not just a gentleman,
an honorable gentleman.
Well, then, how does this story end
with this princess
who's locked in a castle?
I don't know...
I haven't finished it yet.
I'd love to know.
Oh, I wish it would rain.
I wish there was soup again.
I even wish there were rats!
Will you promise me that?
Will you promise to finish your story
and tell me how it ends?
Yes. It will be my quest.
Your quest! You are a very brave mouse.
Thank you, my good gentleman.
Whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa!
and some are destined
to be princesses
every little girl
longs to be a princess.
I'm gonna live right there.
Right up there, near the tippy-top.
Quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine!
Yes, I know. It's gonna be all mine.
No, you deaf little urchin.
I said feed those swine!
Her Uncle Ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one.
That's right.
I'm gonna have a special room
just for my dresses
and another whole closet
just for my knickers!
she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this.
Not long now.
I promise you that.
I told you! I told you
I'd make it to the castle!
Whoa!
You just have to be
able to see it that way.
She was beautiful! Like an angel.
FURLOUGH: You are crazy.
And she smelled so amazing.
Like a garden.
Despereaux!
You can't talk to a human.
That is the worst thing you can do.
No, it's the best thing I ever did.
They will throw you in the dungeon.
You will get eaten by rats!
It would be worth it.
They could tear at my flesh.
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, and when she held me
in her hand, it was...
It was so soft,
like floating in a pillow.
You know what? I'm worried about you.
That's the point, Furlough.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Quiet! They will hear you.
Come on. Just try it.
Just for a second, just try being brave.
- Oh!
- And stop cowering!
What's going on in here?
What's all this talk
about princesses and bravery?
Furlough, I want to see you
in my study, right now.
LESTER: Are you sure?
FURLOUGH: That's what he said.
- A real human?
- A princess.
We need to tell them.
We need to tell the Mouse Council.
- But they'll...
- This is bad. This is very bad.
If they find out...
If they find out that they didn't find out...
Oh, then they'll find
out that it was me who...
Oh, no.
But they will send him to the dungeon!
- Oh, he'll get eaten by rats!
- Oh!
No, not if we beg.
If we really beg
and show them that he's changed.
That he's afraid.
That he's afraid,
and he's turned into a real mouse.
Despereaux!
KNIGHT: For glory and honor!
Surround him!
MAYOR: Despereaux Tilling.
How long have you been
working on this book?
Hmm... A week?
A week? You've hardly cracked it.
Well, I was...
I just wanted to see how it ends.
INQUISITOR: Refused training as a mouse.
Refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice.
Repeatedly engaged in bold
and un-meek behavior.
Triggered willfully
not less than 17 mousetraps.
Just shameful!
Had personal contact with...
With...
With a human being.
Isn't there something you can do?
Antoinette, stop right now! Stop that.
You have to trust them.
They are the Council.
They're the Council because...
Because they're the Council.
They're the Council.
Is there anything you wish to say
in your defense?
Well, it was a very good story,
and she was a very beautiful princess.
Despereaux Tilling,
our laws are here
to protect us and our way of life.
And when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life,
he becomes a threat to us all.
It's an easy question.
Are you a man or are you a mouse?
And your actions have told us
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse.
It is the judgment of this court
that you should be banished
from these walls forever.
You shall be remanded into the
custody of Hovis, the Threadmaster,
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of Dor,
from which no mouse
and no light has ever escaped.
- Shh!
- My baby!
Quiet. Be quiet, my dear.
There's nothing to be done.
Come with me.
Stand there.
Red?
Ah, so they tell me.
So you're the brave one.
I guess.
It's good. It'll carry well down there.
Wear it proudly.
There's no shame.
It's time.
It's all right.
They're too scared to come down here.
In there?
I'm afraid so.
Courage, right?
And truth.
- And honor.
- Good.
But especially courage.
I'm ready.
All right, then you need to...
What? Whoa!
Hello? Hello?
Whoa!
Lads, let's go, on the double!
Who is that?
Who goes there?
Who is that?
Despereaux Tilling.
Are you a man or are you a mouse?
I am a gentleman.
Oh.
- It's a mouse.
- I'm hungry.
Shh! Quiet, lads. Patience.
And what makes you a gentleman?
A code...
A code of honor.
You're a strange little
mouse, aren't you?
And where did you find
this code of honor?
Well, in a legend.
A legend that I read.
Fine. Oh, tell me this legend of yours.
I could do with a good story right now.
Well,
it's about a princess and a knight
and his quest to save her honor.
Ah. It was a princess
that took away my soup.
She didn't take it.
In fact, she misses it, too!
How do you know all this, then?
I've seen her.
- Seen her?
- I've talked to her.
- Talked to her?
- That's why they sent me down here.
Mmm-hmm.
And what did this princess tell you
when you had your little audience?
Eh? Eh?
Oh, you must be a royal mouse.
Is that it?
She told me that
she missed the soup and the rain
and, most of all, the sunlight.
And that she just
wanted it all to come back again.
Well, I don't want to
hear your little stories
about princesses and sunshine.
Go tell them to the rats!
All right, boys, come on!
Good crowd, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is, quite.
CROWD:  Mouse! Mouse!
Mouse! Mouse!
Ah, Roscuro! I'm glad you could make it.
I thought you didn't like the arena.
Huh? Oh! No, no.
It... It's an honor, sir.
Oh!
- BOTTICELLl: Good.
- Mmm.
Well, enjoy.
Oh, uh... Thank you.
Let the games begin!
CROWD:  Mouse! Mouse! Mouse!
RAT: Come on!
Hold on!
CROWD:  Eat! Eat! Eat!
ROSCURO: Wait!
Can I have him?
Can I have this one? Please?
What?
It's just that that one looks tasty.
Well, this is progress.
Perhaps we're starting
to leave the past behind us, eh?
Enjoy, my friend.
Don't leave a morsel.
Oh, I won't.
Pull!
Come on, let's go, buster!
That's it. That's it. You keep moving!
It's okay. Keep walking.
Come on, keep moving! Let's go, come on!
It's right up there.
- Huh?
- Keep walking.
- Oh.
- See that?
Light. Real light.
It's mine, but you can share it.
It isn't much, but there isn't much
anywhere since everything turned gray.
You're not gonna eat me?
No. I don't eat mice.
Then what do you eat?
Crumbs.
When I can find them.
So you are a gentleman.
Tell me that story.
About the Princess.
Tell me what she looked like.
Well, she was...
Was she angry?
No.
No, not at all.
Her heart was full of longing.
What's longing?
and honor and
chivalry and courage.
That she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats.
Even the rats?
And there, in the
darkness of the cellar,
two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle.
Trapped in a life full
of pain and longing.
Your crown, ma'am.
Oh.
I don't want it today.
But it's beautiful, ma'am.
I know, but I don't want it.
You look so pretty in it, ma'am.
Like a princess.
I know. I am the princess.
Oh, I know, ma'am,
but such a fine princess,
with a little, pretty, glittery...
I don't want it!
All right, Mig?
Very well, ma'am.
Please, take it away.
MIG: Princess.
Who's the princess?
I'm a princess.
I'm the princess.
My comb, my hat, my gloves
and my pretty powder
on my pretty princess face.
And what do you think you're doing?
Ma'am!
Where did you get all this?
I just borrowed it, ma'am.
Borrowed it?
I was gonna put them all back.
See that you do!
And you can spend the whole week
taking slop to the dungeon
for your little escapade.
"Princess"!
God! She's the princess.
And now I have to carry the sloppy,
gloppy, stinky stew
down in the damp, dark, dingy...
A person could get
lost forever down here.
Oh!
Din-din.
Slop.
No, don't stop! I said "slop"!
How am I supposed to eat this swill?
Oh, stop that!
I don't have to be putting up with all this!
I serve the Princess.
Right. You serve the Princess.
- That's a bit of a laugh, isn't it?
- I do.
- I bring her tea and...
- Well, I don't want to hear it!
Had me own little princess once.
And now I don't.
Oh. What, you had a princess?
Yeah.
Every dad's got a princess.
Sorry. So, so, sorry!
Oh, well, I've got a real one.
And she's got a tiara and fancy robes,
and she's got shiny bits
all over every frock in her closet.
And I get to see her every single day.
DESPEREAUX: What kind of a quest?
Uh...
To right a terrible wrong.
But who did you wrong?
Okay.
Do you remember when
they banished the rats?
- Sure. Yes.
- Okay.
Well, it wasn't all
the rats they banished.
I mean, they did, but it was
all because of one particular rat
in particular.
Oh.
Mmm-hmm.
If I could just tell her I'm sorry,
that I'm, you know, I'm really sorry.
And that I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.
If she could just hear me say it,
you know, just... Just hear my voice,
she would
know how much I meant it.
That is a very noble quest.
ROSCURO:  Your Highness?
Your Highness?
Is that you?
My little mouse?
Oh, I'm not a mouse. I...
I'm a...
Oh.
I forgot.
You're my little gentleman, aren't you?
Have you come to tell me
how the story ends?
Did you finish your quest?
Where are you?
I have come to apologize.
Oh, you are noble, remember?
You have nothing to be sorry about.
Oh, but I am.
I am sorry.
I know you.
- No, no.
- Oh, no!
No! Please, please listen. Please.
- A rat!
- Please. I just want to tell you.
Someone, please!
Listen. It's okay.
Get it off me! There's a rat in my room!
Please get him off!
What?
Rat!
Oh!
PRINCESS PEA: It's a rat!
GUARD 1: Quick, rush him!
GUARD 2: Get him!
GUARD 3: Filthy rodent!
Uh-oh.
Oh!
GUARD: Where'd he go?
If John or Beth or
Bill was an insult.
It grows back twisted
and gnarled and hard.
But now he just longed for someone
whose heart was as hardened as his was.
Pretty princess.
Pretty, pretty princess pie.
What a pretty princess!
My gloves.
My comb.
My jewel-y, girly hat,
all sitting on my princess head.
Who's the pretty princess pumpkin pie?
You are.
Right. I am.
You are. And you should be
dressed in those clothes.
Quite right. I should.
Mmm-hmm.
And you should lounge in that bed.
Lounging.
Lounging round, yes, the whole day!
And you should be wearing that crown.
I should be wearing a frown?
No. No, no, no. Not a frown. A crown.
Wow! Can't hear me own self think.
- Ah!
- Shh!
- Ah!
- Shh!
Shh!
- Ah!
- Shh!
Who are you?
I'm here to help you.
I can't be caught with
a real rat in my bunk.
I don't think so.
And what if they find you
with a painting of the Princess?
You think that's as bad as a rat?
I want the same thing you do.
What are you doing?
Uh...
I need it for a baby.
No, not a baby!
For milady.
I mean milady.
Yes.
To chop apples.
Mmm.
She'd like some apples.
Now turn and leave.
Now turn and leave.
No, no! Just turn and leave.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Sorry. Bye.
Oh, I can't hear you,
see, because deaf, but...
A bit deaf.
NARRATOR: You know,
hurt is a funny thing.
Here, take care of me little princess.
I can't no more.
Oh, I will. Don't worry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. So, so sorry!
It's hard to see
something on your back.
You can do this. You know you can.
I know I can.
She belongs in the dungeon,
and you belong in the palace, like a princess.
What are you doing?
I'm cleaning, ma'am.
With rope?
It helps, ma'am.
Well, stop it. You look ridiculous.
Sorry, ma'am?
I said you look ridiculous.
- You can't do this, Mig.
- Gor.
Seems I am, ma'am.
You'll get in a terrible
amount of trouble.
Don't listen. You're the princess now.
I'm the princess now.
And you belong in the palace.
I belong in the palace.
And she belongs in...

MIG: I'm in here!
Help!
You filthy, stinking rat!
You tricked me!
RAT 1: Here's the spot, rats!
SMUDGE: What's Roscuro brought us, then?
RAT 2: Hungry! Yum! Hungry now!
Not yet, lads.
No, no, you've got to wait.
It's nowhere near dinnertime.
Oh, come on, Smudge, I'm starving.
RAT 1: Something special
for dinner tonight.
RAT 3: Smells delicious!
RAT 2: Smells human to me. A young one.
RAT 3: And not just any human.
RAT 2: Let's have a look.
RAT 3: It's the Princess!
SMUDGE: Oi, you'll wait
for your dinner like everyone else.
RAT 2: Come on, Smudge,
give us a little look.
SMUDGE: No, no, no!
SMUDGE: Boss doesn't want her getting
nervous. Spoils the meat, doesn't it?
DESPEREAUX: Milady!
Psst! Milady!
Oh, my little mouse! It's you.
I will deliver you from this evil, ma'am.
Oh, no. Just go find my father.
Take this chain from around my neck.
To show him you are honest and truthful.
Oh, I am!
Honest and truthful and loyal and...
I know.
But hurry.
Here. Take it.
There isn't much time.
Whoa!
Ha-ha!
Oh, oh!
RAT 1: Hey, did you get some?
RAT 2: Oh, yeah.
Here you are, sir.
Fresh worms.
Oh, um...
Thank you.
Well done, Roscuro!
You hear that?
That's all because of you.
Come, my friend. Look at your handiwork.
DESPEREAUX: King! King!
Sire, your daughter is in danger!
Sire, up here!
Your Highness! Please, sir!
Oh, come on.
Oh!
Hey, Sire!
Your Highness!
Look, Your Highness! Look!
Hello, Mr. King!
Hey, hello!
Whoa!
Down here! Hello! Down here!
Listen, your daughter is in danger!
She's in a dungeon!
You're the only one who can help!
She sent me to get you!
Sir, please! Sir...
Ooh! Sire!
Your Highness!
Look down here! Whoa!
Dad? Dad, listen. You've got to help me.
But you're dead!
No. No, I'm not. I'm not dead!
Now, listen. The Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the dungeon.
Oh, my golly, you're dead.
Dad! Dad, I'm not dead!
Dad, I'm not dead!
Oh, Dad, wake up, please!
Furlough, listen. You've gotta help me.
You're...
No. No, I'm not dead.
Listen, the Princess is in danger.
She's locked in the cellar.
Oh, my God, you're dead!
No!
Whoo!
DESPEREAUX: Guys? Listen.
Okay, look. Now, I'm not dead.
The Princess is in danger,
and she's down in the dungeon
and you've gotta... You've gotta help me!
Somebody?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hmm.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, ho, ho!
Ah!
Whoa!
Oh, I must have been...
Enough!
Ah-ha!
Ah!
Look at you! You are still brewing tea.
If you want to make a statement,
what do I say?
Make it a good one!
Ah, it's so great to see you!
BOLDO: Fantastic!
- Ah.
- Marjoram?
Mmm-hmm. Love it. Perfect.
- Ah!
Basil, will you look at that?
Oh!
Look up there!
Marge, come and have a look at this!
Oh, my!
Mmm!
Cauliflower?
Perfect. Perfect, yes, it's about time.
Eh, some celery?
Hey, hello!
Good, celery. Parsley, maybe.
- DESPEREAUX: The Princess is in danger!
- No, no, no.
- Garlic! Should I use the garlic?
- Look down here!
- I mean not too much, but just a little bit.
- Oh, no, no, no, of course.
- It is fantastic!
- Yes.
Brav-ow!
Oh.
The Princess is in danger!
Ooh!
You are a cute little mouse.
Would you like some soup?
No, I don't want...
The Princess is in danger!
And a talking mouse, too.
Listen, you've gotta help me.
Perhaps a little cheese?
No, I don't want any cheese!
The Princess! She's in danger!
She's locked in the dungeon!
In the dungeon!
Oh, don't be silly, my little mouse.
Everything is fine!
The Princess is perfectly
safe up in her...
Oh, my.
Boldo!
Look! It's...
Boldo.
Where are you?
Charge!
Tell me again.
- Chivalry!
- Mmm.
- Bravery!
- Mmm-hmm.
Honor!
Chivalry! Bravery! Honor!
I love it!
Oh, it feels so good to
be out of the kitchen!
Let's go!
Into the breach!
Down there.
Whoa!
Ha-ha!
Where did she go?
BOTTICELLl: My friends!
My friends, there are rats,
and then there are rats!
And I would like a huge round of applause
for our good friend here
for delivering us our princess!
Come on, let's go!
Oi! Hang on! Where you going? Help!
Hurry!
Look at that!
Let's get him, boys.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
Keep going! Keep going!
Please! Oh, no, get off of me!
Nice shot!
That's my onion!
MIG: Hello?
Help!
Help!
Can anybody hear me?
Help!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
Oh, gor!
What took you so long?
I've been screaming in here
for over two hours.
My little princess.
Rain.
Yes.
Papa! Papa, look!
Up there!
The sun!
Go on, Despereaux.
Wait! Wait just a moment! Patience!
Not just yet.
The honor is all yours, my friend.
CROWD:  Eat! Eat! Eat!
Eat! Eat! Eat!
was the strongest thing
a person could feel?
Because a single act of
forgiveness can change everything.
No.
What?
No.
You worthless little...
CROWD: Eat! Eat! Eat!
Help!
Who let him out?
Hey, you!
It's that mouse!
Get him!
Ah, if it isn't our brave little knight.
- I wonder.
- No!
Should I finish you off myself
or turn you into cat food?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
What is that?
Please. Nice kitty?
No, no, no, no!
Hmm?
Thank you, my good gentleman.
I am sorry.
I'm the one who should be sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
You've no idea how sorry I am.
That's all right.
I'm so sorry.
NARRATOR:
So, you could call all of this
a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to.
And a rat was hurt,
so he hurt a princess.
And the jailer finally
found his princess.
And the mice finally
got rid of their fear.
and felt a cool
breeze each morning
and the sun in his
face every afternoon.
And we'd tell you that they all
lived happily ever after, but...
Whoa!
Whoa!
