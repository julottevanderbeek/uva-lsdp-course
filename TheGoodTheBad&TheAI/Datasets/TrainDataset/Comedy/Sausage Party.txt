Hey, Brenda, you and me...
I'm so happy that God's
put our packages together!

- It's like we were made for each other!
- Get ready, boys!
- It feels amazing!
Oh, oh, yes!
I'm the first to enter eternity!
Potato!
Way to go, buddy!
Oh, Jesus fuck!
Oh, fuck! Me skin!
- She's peeling me fucking skin!
- What the fuck?!
For the love of shit, run!
Run!
I want my mommy!
They're eating children!
Fucking children!
So, you've learned
the terrible truth?
- I've got to tell everyone!
- No one will believe you.
I have to try!
Everyone will die, otherwise!
Oh, yeah! That's a good point!
Fuck me, right?
Run for your fucking lives!
Once you see that shit...
it will fuck you up for life.
Good luck! Have fun!
