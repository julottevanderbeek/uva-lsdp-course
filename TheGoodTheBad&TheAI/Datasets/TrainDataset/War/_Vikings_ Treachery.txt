Hello, priest.
_
Ragnar: Do you ever miss England?
- Athelstan: Sometimes.
Ragnar: Come with me.
We will need the help of all the gods,
Siggy: Go and speak with your brother.
I ask only for the opportunity
to regain your respect.
Why should I ever trust you again?
Aslaug: I make this prophecy:
Your son will be born
with the image of the serpent in his eye.
I do not wish Jarl Borg to raid with us.
I thought we had an agreement?
Jarl Borg: Abandon your brother for good.
Oh!
Messenger: The Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.
_
What have you heard about King Ecbert?
That he's just like you.
More, give me more
give me more
if I had a heart I could love you
if I had a voice I would sing
after the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
If I had a voice I would sing

Ragnar: What is that place?
Athelstan: It's a
Christian church, a minster.
A large one. It may be Winchester.
Is it important?
If it is Winchester, Saint
Birinus is buried there.
It's a place of great pilgrimage.
And will there be treasure there?
Yes. A lot of treasure.
Floki:  Hmm!
that these Northmen have arrived in Wessex.
After I heard about their
raids into Northumbria,
I realized it was only a matter of time
before they came ashore here.
When I lived at the court
of the Emperor Charlemagne,
these Northmen had already
emerged from their lairs
I was with Charlemagne's
party at a harbor town
There was some confusion
about their identity,
but from the build of their ships
and their speed through the water,
the Emperor recognized
them at once as Northmen.
After a lightning attack...
And now it is our turn to
deal with these ruffians,
these pagans.
And must.
Aethelwulf?
Yes, Father.
to work with our
Ealdormen to raise an army.
In the meantime, we shall
send spies and others
to observe the size of the raiding party,
These Northmen never like to
venture far from their ships
and they prefer not to be
drawn into pitched battle.
Why must I follow you up the fields?
You're my wife.
I will not stay to hear my son insulted.
He continues to be resentful.
He refuses to accept or
acknowledge my love for him.
Lagertha: You don't love my son.
You don't love anyone, Sigvard.
You don't know how to.
Aghhh!
Sigvard: Forgive me, Lagertha.
I'm an intemperate man.
I find it difficult to control myself.
But I have loved and
desired you after my fashion
and if your son will only meet me halfway,
I will make sure he has a good future.
Soldier 1: The alarm! Northmen coming!
- Soldier 1: Quickly!
- Soldier 2: Inside, now!
- Soldier 3: Altogether!
- Soldier 4: Gab inne!
- Soldier 5: Inside! Gab inne!
-
Ungh! Oof!
- Monk: Come!
- Man 1: Stay together!
- Soldier 1: Are you ready?!
- Soldier 2: Weapons!
Saxons:
Vikings:
Ughhh!
Agh! Ugh!
Athelstan: Aggghhhhh!
Ungh! Oof!
Aggghhhhhhhh!
Soldier:
Agh!
Agghhhhh!
Ungh! Agh!
Agghhh!
Ungh!
Torstein: Could be a trap!
Shield-wall!
Open.
King Horik: Where have they all gone?
Floki: There should be treasure.
He said there would be treasure.
Why do you always listen to him?
Where is it?
Athelstan: It's over there.
King Horik: This?! This is not treasure!
This is an empty wooden table.
You are mistaken, King Horik.
The treasure is here.
You're standing on it.
Horik:  You were right!
Treasure!
Ragnar: How did you know?
Athelstan: It is a Christian habit
to bury the bones of the
revered dead beneath the alter.
Ragnar!
Ragnar: Who was this?
Athelstan: It must be Saint Birinus.
Ragnar: You keep talking to
me like I know what a Saint is.
Athelstan: A Saint is a man who
has lived a particularly holy life,
performed some miracle,
or been martyred killed for their beliefs.
But I am dead. What use can I be?
Christians believe that the bones
can still exert benediction.
Can perform miracles.
What is a miracle?
Miracles are things...
which are impossible to do.
Torstein: Wait!
Monk: No! Stop!
Ungh!
Bishop Swithern:
Dear Lord, forgive them,
_
Bishop Swithern: You
speak our language?! How?
It doesn't matter. Just do as I say. Hide!
- Hide or they will kill you.
- You are one of us!
Once.
One day, you will be caught.
for an apostate is the lowest
and the vilest of all creatures
Floki: Oh!
King Horik:
_
_
_
Bishop Swithern: Salve,
nobilis, et pretiose...
Ungh!
Floki and Vikings:
Warriors:
Athelstan: What will happen to him?
Floki: You just wait and see, priest!
Warrior: Woo-hoo!
Bishop Swithern:  Domine...
Rescipe ergo in me oculis
misercordiae tuae...
Warrior 3:  Treasure!
Warrior 4:  Look! Look!
- Warrior 1: Help me!
- Warrior 2: Here!
Bishop Swithern:
Domini, creatura tue,
- Warrior: Don't kill him, Floki.
- Bishop Swithern: Penitent...
Ungh!
Vikings:
Bishop Swithern: Penitent me.
Floki: Is he still talking? Tough old goat.
King Horik: Erlendur, quiet
him. Right in his mouth.
- Warrior: What's he doing?
- Warrior 2: Out of the way.
Deus tippi benidicas.
Suffer no more, but trust in thy salvation.
Bjorn: Mother, why would you
allow him to do that to you?
What are you talking about?
Your husband, Earl Sigvard,
I saw him!
Bjorn, please.
Please what?
Has he hit you before?
Will you let him hit you again?
It will never happen again.
If it does, I'll kill him.
I said it won't.
What would Ragnar say?
What has it to do with your father?
Nothing!
Sometimes I think of him.
I miss him. I can't help it.
Of course not. You're his son.
You must always be proud.
As should you for being his wife!
Siggy: Another son?
Aslaug: Yes.
What is his name?
Sigurd, after my father.
Sigurd snake-in-the-eye.
Of course.
I grieve.
Bishop Edmund: The martyrdom
of my fellow bishop,
Bishop Swithern, a fine Christian.
King Ecbert: Praise be to God.
Lord Eadric: There are those
who ask why we did not do more
to protect our brothers and sisters
at such an important site.
Are there?
There are many important sites.
Could I protect all of them? No.
Did I want to discover where
the pagans would strike?
Yes.
For now I know where they are.
Bishop Edmund: So...
Bishop Swithern was a necessary sacrifice.
As a man of God,
I assumed he welcomed the
opportunity for martyrdom.
Or do you disagree?
All of the cloth would welcome martyrdom
in the cause of our faith,
service of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Good.
Because I'm going to offer you
precisely that same opportunity,
my Lord Bishop,
and, I trust, very soon.
Lord Eadric:
I have something for you, Athelstan.
Are these not the images of your God?
I told you before, and
I will tell you again:
My God is Odin, the all father.
I know you told me.
Only... I don't believe you.
And this? Ragnar gave me this.
Wearing a dog-turd doesn't make you a dog.
Oh.
The hand of your holy man, I believe.
Ragnar: So tell me,
how do you find England?
Horik: It is a pleasant
land, rich with treasure.
You are right. This land is rich.
But here... here is the real treasure!
Earth? Have you not seen?
Everywhere we go, there are crops.
There is food growing.
I am a farmer and the son of a farmer,
and this is what I understand.
Compared to our poor countries,
where it is hard to farm,
hard to live.
Here, it is easy.
If we lived here, we could feed everybody.
There would be no hunger.
I like your thinking,
but here is my question:
Will the Saxons simply invite us
to live among them, hmm?
- Man: Jarl Borg!
- Man 2: To your new bride!
Man 3: A fine choice this day!
Jarl Borg: Thank you!
So I am married for the second time.
As most of you know,
my first marriage lasted less than an hour,
because my own brother
poisoned the drinks that day.
Of course, the same thing
can never happen twice,
so let the wine be poured.
Men and women:  Yeah! Here, here!
Now who will be the first
to drink in celebration?
I will.
No! No, I could not bear
it. Not a second time.
Let me taste the wine.
It's quite all right.
Skol!
Jarl Borg: I have something
else important to say.
I don't wish to dampen the celebrations
but you all know that the
agreement between myself,
King Horik, and Ragnar
Lothbrok has been broken.
They have gone raiding
west without me, without us,
which is an insult not only to myself,
but to all of you,
and to my wife's family.
I have to do something about this insult.
Frankly, I blame King Horik
more for what has happened,
consider what is happening
to Earl Ragnar's lands.
He has abandoned them
to the care of his wife
and his drunken brother.
In order to punish those
who have insulted me and my family,
I declare today that I will seek vengeance
against Ragnar Lothbrok.
By all our gods,
I swear that we will seize all his lands
and that I will repay
his brother's treachery
with the axe.
Bishop Edmund: Who can speak to us?
I can.
I have been sent here by Ecbert,
King of Wessex.
Ragnar: Well, that depends.
Bishop Edmund: Upon what?
Ragnar: Upon what he'll
offer us to leave...
or what he'll offer us to stay.
Stay?
Ragnar: Yes, we want to
make peace with the king.
Peace.
So we don't have to kill any more of you.
I will relay your message to the king.
King Horik:  Wait!
Ughhh!
Bishop Edmund:
Floki:
Bishop Edmund:  Agh!
Vikings:
Sigvard: Not hungry, Bjorn?
No.
Sigvard: Any reason?
No reason.
Sigvard: Are you unhappy?
Shall I raid one of my
unsuspecting neighbours,
so you can show off your fighting skills,
and maybe slaughter them all?
Show that you are truly
the son of Ragnar Lothbrok?!
I do not like to see you so solemn.
So tell me, what can I do?
Bjorn: You can let me go live
in a cabin in the mountains.
Sigvard: By yourself? In the mountains?
Bjorn: Yes. I'd like to test myself.
I want to know what is essential to life.
What is really important.
No, of course not.
I am the Earl here.
What would folk think if
I let my beloved stepson
starve or freeze to death
in some mountain pigsty?
Sigvard and men:
Sigvard: You understand
that, don't you, my boy?
In any case,
I have solemnly sworn to Lagertha
that I shall take care of you, and I will.
Siggy: Rollo, wake up!
Rollo:  What? What is it?
- Siggy: There are boats!
- Rollo:
Rollo: I think I can guess.
Go back to the town.
Find anyone who can fight,
anyone who can hold a weapon.
We're under attack.
Aslaug: Rollo, what is
it? What is happening?
Rollo: Jarl Borg! He has
come back to attack us.
Aslaug: Jarl Borg?
Rollo:  I'm sure it is him.
Ragnar and King Horik broke
their agreement with him.
He has returned to gain his revenge.
What are we going to do?
What do you
think we're going to do?
We're going to fight.
Aslaug: Come. Go! Go!
Rollo: Torfin! Olaf!
One of you on each flank.
Help with the barricades.
Ragnar has taken all of
the best fighting men.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
Not you. You are not a shield-maiden.
- You're not...
- Lagertha?
Siggy, I need you to go
back to the great hall.
Find Princess Aslaug and her children
and take them up into the mountains.
- And then what?
- Wait.
For what?
For whatever the gods have
decided is about to happen.
Now go!
Siggy: This way! To the mountains.
Hurry! Go, Hvitserk.
Aslaug: Run! Quickly!
Sail down!
Row! Row!
Rollo: Stay strong!
Don't make it easy for them!
Light the fires!
- Warrior: Come on!
-
Oars!
Rollo: Hold your places!
Jarl Borg: Go!
Agghhhh!
Aghhh!
Agghhhh!
- Jarl bork: Ungh!
- Man: Aggghhhh!
Ungh! Oof! Agh!
- Woman: As fast as you can!
- Girl: Shields!
Aghhhh! Ungh!
Rollo: Fall back!
Fall back!
Back to the market place.
Jarl Borg:
That's right, Rollo, run!
Run like you always do.
Agghhhh!
Yah!
Rollo: Loose!
Agghhh!
- Rollo: Loose!
-
- Jarl Borg: Shield-wall!
-
-
- Boy: This way.
Jarl Borg: You can't win, Rollo!
Old warrior: There is no
disgrace in the eyes of the gods
to save yourself for another day, Rollo.
Old warrior: Your first duty is
to try and save the sons of Ragnar.
Jarl Borg: Surrender!
Old warrior: Rollo, go!
I will tell the gods what you have done.
Jarl Borg: Now, do you surrender?
