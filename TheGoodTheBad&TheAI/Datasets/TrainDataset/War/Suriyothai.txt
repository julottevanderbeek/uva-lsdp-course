In 1548 the year of the Monkey.
King Maha Chakkraphat became
ruler of the city of Ayothaya.
Only seven months later
Ta-beng Schweti King of Hongsawadi
Ied an invading army out against
Ayothaya.
King Maha Chakkraphat
Ied his army into battle against
Hongsawadi.
His queen and daughter
rode beside him.
When battle was joined the vanguard
was routed -confusion reigned
everywhere.
The queen and the King's daughter
fought bravely from behind
on their elephant until both of
them perished.
The name of the queen who sacrifice
her life so gallantly has passed
into legend as Queen Suriyothai.
This is her story.
In 1 528 the year of the Rat,
Siam had two kings.
Rama Thibodi ll who
reigned in Ayothaya.
And his cousin
King Athitaya who ruled
the northern city of Pitsanulok.
It was a time of peace.
No battles troubled the reign
of either king.
Wang Chang, Mount Soi Dao
In 1 528, the year of the Rat.
In the twelfth month,
King Ayothaya
journeyed to the Wang Chang on
Mount Soi Dao.
In his entourage was Princess
Suriyothai of the house of Praruang
savouring the spectacle of
the elephant round-up.
Your Highness!.
Don't lean out like that.
People might see you.
It goes against royal conventions.
We're on holiday, Nanny.
Can't I even look at the scenery?
You're a grown woman now.
Try and behave like one
-The court rules are quite clear
-Oh, rules, rules, rules.
I'm worn out with rules I'm sick to
death of rules.
Will I meet Lord Piren?.
Of course not, Your Highness
You're not a child any more.
You can't just go out and meet men.
It's absolutely forbidden.
Even when the man is
my own brother?.
Even then?.
Lord Piren isn't really
your brother, Your Highness.
Just a relative
A distant cousin
Oh, I am so, so, so, so bored!!
Nanny?.
Your Highness
I'm dying of thirst.
Have pity. Fetch me a little water.
Your Highness
Kayoon.
Quickly. Take my place
Your Highness.
This is not a good idea
Where are you going,
Your Highness.
Please let's get back to
the palanquin.
It won't do for you to
be seen in public.
It's a serious violation
against the rules.
Stop fussing Pudkrong.
Lord Piren is not a stranger.
He's my cousin.
Why shouldn't I see him?
I've never set foot outside
the palace before.
Please indulge me
Show me all there is to be seen.
For myself nothing would give
me greater pleasure.
But that you should go back to
the lnner Palace.
For your own sake before you
get caught and punished.
Don't expect me to go
back to the palace.
If you don't like being with me
just say so and leave me.
We need never see each
others faces again
No, no, it's not like
that at all.
You..you are like my life
There's nothing in the world
I could want more, desire more
Iove more than you
Do you mean that?. Honestly?
Or are you lying to me?
Listen to me Suriyothai.
On my honour as a warrior, what
I say now is the absolute truth.
If at any time in the future.
My body or my brain can be of
service to you in any way.
All you have to do is send me word.
I will be beside you before you can
even turn your head
You don't have
to promise quite that much
All I really want is an elephant
That would make me so very,
very happy
That little elephant-he's perfect
Would you catch him for me?
If you want him,
you shall have him
Be careful! It's dangerous
Don't go too close
There's Prince Tien
That's my elephant!!
He's a wild elephant, he belongs
to whoever can catch him
The Crown Prince is here
Is Princess Suriyothai in residence?
Lord Srisurin
Go and fetch
the princess immediately.
The Princess does not wish to see
the Crown Prince.
She refuses?
Come and pay your respects to
the Crown Prince. At once!!
I have no desire to see him
This elephant I have named
Plai Song Tawan.
I caught him with the sole purpose
of presenting him to
Your Highness as a gift.
Lord Srisurin
Thank you for accepting
my invitation
My greatest joy is to honour
Your Highness's wishes
They tell me
you have an EXTREMELY
beautiful daughter
Do you mean Suriyothai?
Presumably
How old is she?
Nearly fifteen.
Ah. My son...
begs me to ask...
your permission for her hand
in marriage.
If it is Your Highness's wish.
I have no objections whatsoever.
Who are you?
From the look of your garments
and demeanour.
She is Suriyothai.
One of the daughters of Lord
Srisurin Governor of Pitsanulok
She is my cousin.
Suriyothai?
Aren't you about to marry
Prince Tien.
-l....
-Don't be afraid to tell me, child.
Think of me as one of the family.
Speak your mind.
With regards to the wedding
between myself and the Prince
You would rather not marry
my nephew?
Suriyothai.
Although I may be the King
but I have no desire to force anyone
into something against their will.
I could change my mind today
and the whole idea could be forgotten
It would be the easiest thing
in the world.
But..this is what you must consider
it would cause a rift between
Pitsanulok and Ayothaya
which in the long
run might have serious consequences.
Can you live with
that responsibility?
You won't run away again?
Is that understood?
A white omen appears in the sky.
Indra's arrow
crossing relentlessly from the South
to the Northwest.
Sunday. Eighth day of the waxing moon
of the twelfth lunar month.
King RamaThibodi ll goes into
the chapel
That same night he passes away.
Pitsanulok
His Majesty King Rama Thibodi
is no more.
Long live His Majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Long live His Majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Today is an auspicious day.
The ninth month
of the year of the Cow.
Thursday.
An auspicious day
on which His Majesty
the great King
Nor Puthangkul
has appointed
by royal decree
the Lady Oon
daughter of Lord Yomaraj
to me the High Consort
from this day forward.
Wang Chai Palace
I have come down from Pitsanuloke.
To warn His Majesty that
the Northern provinces are no longer
loyal to Ayothaya
The reason? His Majesty appears to
have lost interest
in the affairs of his Kingdom
He seems not even to care that
the new King of Toungoo
went and thumbed his nose at
the Mon in Hongsawadi
with a mere 500 soldiers
Do you know why he went there?
To stage an piercing ceremony
at Shwe-mawdaw Temple
Hundreds upon hundreds
of Mon soldiers
quaking with fear of a single child
Surely, as the Second King
His Majesty trusted you
to handle these matters on his behalf
That's not the reason.
It's because he can think of nothing
but his new consort. He's infatuated
Why must you treat me with
so much deference?
Are we no longer brother and sister?
Your Highness is now the wife of
the Crown Prince
You shouldn't even be talking to me
I will, with your permission,
take my leave.
I have returned from China
with a special gift for you
What is it?
And what favour are you asking from
my husband in exchange?
I would like you to speak
to your daughter.
My daughter is the High Consort.
The High Consort. Exactly so.
Ask her to talk to her husband.
You mean His Majesty?
His Majesty, yes, His Majesty.
I want her to tell him that
I have some Chinese cannons to sell
If your daughter, the High Consort,
speaks to His Majesty on my behalf
how can he refuse?
And I will give you a commission
of ten per cent.
I, Captain Raj Saneha,
retired officer.
pledge my allegiance to Prince Tien
on behalf of myself and all my men
Why did you leave the army?
Because I wouldn't prostrate myself
before Lord Yommaraj
All those who refused to
grovel to him
were dismissed from service
And now you wish
to serve the Prince?
To Prince Tien
I can submit willingly
without a moment's hesitation
An heir to the throne is born!
Your Highness now has a brother
How can I be the brother
of a Prince?
I am merely the son of
the King's concubine
You are still his older brother
I am not worthy to be
the brother of the future King
Each of us has his allotted
share of merit
which has been ordained
from the beginning
No one can change his destiny
In 1 533. The year of the Snake.
The smallpox epidemic sweeps across
the Kingdom. Thousands perish
Promise me..
No, not merely promise.
Swear...
that you will permit
Prince Ratthati-raja kuman...
to become King
by right of accession
Swear...
that neither one of you
will take away the throne
from my son
I swear, Your Majesty
Swear!
I swear, Your Majesty
May the King reign in
good health and happiness
Long live the King!
Ta-beng Shweti's camp outside Bassein.
His Majesty, Nor Puthangkul
has passed away
This is the opportune moment for
Toungoo to attack Ayothaya
Once we've taken Bassein
we'll move on to Ayothaya
We'll get more troops from Bassein.
Ayothaya will crumble in no time.
They'll be hopelessly outnumbered.
One moment, Your Majesty.
I think this is not the moment for
Toungoo onto march on Ayothaya.
How can you say that?
Even though Nor Puthangul has gone..
Yet, the moment Toungoo's troops
enter Ayothaya.
Chai Raja, the Second King,
who reigns in Pitsanulok.
will seize the throne from
Ratthati-raja kuman
so that he can defend the city
against our attack.
He is a fierce and able warrior.
One not to be lightly underestimated.
Yes. What you say has
a convincing ring to it.
In any even,
first we must take Bassein.
By tomorrow. I want it by tomorrow.
Fire!
From this moment on
you are no longer Hong
Chinese merchant of Nai Kai
Who am I then?
You are Sir Choduk Raja-sethi.
Commander of the left bank
with sole authority
to set prices..all prices..
for all forms of merchandise
A penny buys only three bowls
of rice?
Yes, Your Highness.
A wagon load costs one pound,
two shillings
and a penny farthing.
Where will we find the money to feed
those who depend on us?
And what about other goods?
All the prices are going up.
Especially if it imported
from China or Portugal.
Then it costs as much as
twice the cost.
At all goes according to
whatever Sir Choduk decides.
I thought so.
Hong is behind this.
Sir Pinit? How much money do we have
in the treasury?
Just enough to see us through
to harvest time.
But we need money for weapons,
Portuguese armour,
uniforms for the Prince's soldiers.
We shall have to make do with
what we have.
But that's impossible.
The old weapons are beyond repair
And anyway, a Prince is judged by the
condition of his army and his forces.
If our equipment is shabby
and ineffectual
we will lose face.
Take this. Pawn it with
Seng at Nai Kai canal.
It should fetch you a good price.
Enough to purchase what we need.
Your Highness.
That was your mother's ring!
It's nothing
compared to the Prince's honour.
I must see His Highness.
His Highness is still sleeping.
I must see him. It's absolutely vital.
What is it?
Prince Chai Raja has staged
a coup d'etat.
He led his army down from Pitsanulok
and seized the throne!
Your Highness!
Sanpet Prasat throne hall.
In 1 534, the Year of the Horse.
Your Highness!
Help us. Please!
Help me!
Put away your weapons. At once!
Why have you done this?
You swore an oath.
You swore to accept Prince Rattha
as your sovereign.
In the presence of all things sacred,
you gave your word!
What do you suggest I do?
Let the people go on suffering
as they are suffering now?
Spare me your hypocrisy.
You want the throne!
It's as simple as that
It was mine from the beginning.
But I took pity on a dying man.
For five long months,
I kept careful watch
to see how the Regent
and his cronies
would rule the Kingdom
Since Ratthathiraj came to power
the city has been in turmoil
Even worse, many provinces
have switched their allegiance
from Ayothaya
to Toungoo.
Sooner or later
Ayothaya will be overrun
and succomb to the power and
might of King Ta-beng Shweti.
For this reason.
I had to break my oath
to a late King.
What will happen to the boy?
Where are you, Mummy?
Mummy!
Where are you?
I'm frightened!
Help me!
Take me back to bed.
-I want to go back to sleep.
-Wait.
Let the Lady Worachan
attend to His Majesty.
I'm frightened.
Hush, there's no need to be afraid.
I'm here. I'm right beside you.
Mummy!
Where are you?
Mummy!
This will never happen again!
Whatever the circumstances.
There will be no more
of this kind of killing.
I think Prince Chai Raja
did the right thing.
The right thing?
Killing an innocent child?
Yes.
Sacrificing one life,
however innocent
to end bloodshed across the Kingdom.
It's Prince Chai Raja
who is shedding the blood..
That's not true.
The Second King knew
that if he did nothing
it would mean the end of Ayothaya.
If you were in his place.
You would have done the same.
Never. I would never do that.
No matter what
the innocent should never suffer.
It was in the year 1 534,
The year of the Horse
that the young King was executed and
King Chai Raja ascended the throne.
In 1 535 The Year of the Goat
It seems that I can no longer
carry out my duties.
I am the Lord of Life.
Highest in the Kingdom.
I will not let you die.
Even the Lord of Life
cannot defy the Lord
of the Underworld.
I.. humbly..take my leave.
Jitravadee!
Jitravadee!!
The Queen Jitravadee
gave birth to the Prince Yodfa
then bled to death.
So doing. She opened the way
for Princess Srisudachan
of the House of U-Thong.
She was appointed Royal Consort to
the King Chai Raja.
What is your name?
Boonsri, Your Majesty.
I hold the rank of Royal Steward.
Custodian of the Outer Hall
housing the Buddha images.
So. Are you descended
from the U-Thong dynasty?
I am, Your Majesty.
They tell me that you are
an exceptional singer.
They flatter me, Your Majesty.
Sing a verse for me.
I will decide if that is flatterey.
That fellow Boonsri,
who sang for His Majesty.
Custodian of the Outer Hall.
He holds the rank of steward.
The Outer Hall.
That's the residence of
Pra Matamatayikka, Her Royal
Great Grand Mother, isn't it?
Yes. Her Highness resides at
Piman Rattaya Hall.
Perhaps it's time we presented
ourselves to Her Highness.
Pimam Rattaya Hall, Front Palace.
Sroy, take this betel nut
and give it to that steward.
Tell him it is a reward
for his singing,
which has touched me deeply.
Yes, My Lady.
The High Consort instructs me
to bring you this gift.
A reward for pleasing her
with your melodious renditions.
Your visit here today...
was no accident.
You are fulfilling
the desires of those ancestors
from whose shades nothing is hidden.
The usurping dynasty of Suphanna-bhumi
has taken over the throne
of the U-Thong
for far too long.
Very soon
you will understand what I am saying
if the U-thong blood
runs strong in your veins.
I came to inform Your Highness.
That a few days from now.
I take my vows as a nun
If that is what you truly desire.
I wish you every happiness.
No matter what happens
the House of
Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj
will always honour the House of
Suphanna-bhumi and offer obeisance
for generations to come.
But one thing more.
Never trust Srisudachan.
Watch her closely.
Be on your guard against
this High Consort.
She is not what she seems to be.
In 1 538. The year of the Dog.
