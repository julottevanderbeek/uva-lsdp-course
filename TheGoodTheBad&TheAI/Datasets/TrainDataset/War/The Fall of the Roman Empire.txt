Two of the greatest problems in history
Are how to account for the rise of Rome
And how to account for her fall.
We may come nearly to understanding
of the truth,
But if we remember that the fall of Rome
like her rise,
Had not one cause but many.
And it was not an event,
But a process spread over 300 years.
Some nations have not lasted that long
As Rome fell.
In the year 180 A.D.,
The Emperor Marcus Aurelius,
Who led his Roman legions
Against the Germaenic tribes along
the Danium frontier.
My lord, Caesar. The omens are bad.
I could not find its heart.
When I was a child Themonitus,
I has a secret fear
that night would come
And would never end.
That we would live out our lives
in total darkness,
But it was a small fear then.
Yet my lord, Caesar.
The sun always rises,
And will again.
So you say.
It is said more people died this moment
When night is about to give way to day
than in any other time.
It seems to me night whispers:
Come away with me
To the west, and sleep forever.
What is another day to offer you?
What is another day to offer you,
Themonitus?
Warmth...
Life...
Color...
People.
My lord, Caesar,
The sun.
As you predicted.
I congratulate you, Themonitus
Themonitus. Levius,
Levius.
How is Caesar?
Well, in order to answer that question
One must consider three aspects of
the situation
One, our emperor has been
at the war for 17 years
And lived under
very difficult conditions.
Two, no one could ever describe
Marcus Aurelius
As a robust man.
There's a joke among the soldiers here
about Themonitus.
They say ask Themonitus what day is it,
And he will lecture you
on the history of the calendar.
You are well my lord, Caesar.
It seems that every governor, every king
In the whole empire
is waiting in the valley below.
I invited them here
for a particular purpose.
I've also asked my son, Comadeus.
Your great friend, Comadeus.
Tell me of your last campaign
In this barbarian forest.
Two or three times,
We thought we had Balimar, their leader,
But each time he was able to get away.
A few days longer, Caesar.
We'll bring you his head.
No, Levius.
Please don't bring me his head.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.
Bring him to me alive.
But he is the heart of the barbarians...
Then bring me
the heart of the barbarians.
I wish to speak with him
Speak with him?
Rome has existed for a thousand years,
It is time we find peaceful ways
to live with those
You called barbarians,
So bring me this Balimar
alive and quickly.
There was a rumor that Lucila was here.
Lucila, Caesar's daughter.
Ah yes, Caesar's daughter.
As the dog fears the eagle,
As the lamb fears the wolf,
So is my heart heavy with fear.
Oh, mother Vesta,
eternal mother of Rome.
Help me.
Bring back the health of my father.
Protect us from the danger
which hangs over the empire.
Let there be peace over all Rome.
Lucila.
Levius.
Lucila,
You are beautiful.
You are beautiful...
What does that mean?
It has been so long.
I have forgotten.
Why didn't you ever try to see me
when you are in Rome?
It seemed you didn't want to see anyone.
I thought by living alone away
from the world,
I could find peace.
Then I found there is no real peace
In being alone.
There is only loneliness.
I too had been lonely, Lucila.
I'm here now, Levius.
And if my father's health improves,
And if your duties
as a soldier do not prevent it,
We may see each other,
If you want to.
I want to.
Kitritdarte, king of Petra.
Welcome Kitritdarte. Welcome Petra.
Costabokus, king of the Omnia.
Greetings Costabokus, king of the Omnia.
Severius, proconsul of Judea.
Africa.
Welcome... Perjileana,
proconsul of Syria.
Marcelus, governor of Egypt I think.
Marcelus, friend of Caesar.
And who would this be, Themonitus?
Perjileana, proconsul of Syria.
My greatful thanks Themonitus.
Perjileana, friend of Caesar.
Welcome.
Pericleas, proconsul of Athens.
Pericleas of Athens.
Rome is honored, Sir Hamas
That Armenian's king is with us.
My lord, Caesar
Armenia hopes for
even closer ties to Rome.
Perthinas, Britania
Welcome Perthinas.
Welcome Britania.
Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Governors, consuls,
Princes...
You have come from the deserts of Egypt,
From the mountains of Armenia,
From the forest of Goule
And the prairies of Spain.
You do not resemble each other,
Nor do you wear the same clothes,
Nor sing the same songs,
Nor worship the same gods.
Yet like a mighty tree
With green leaves and black roots,
You are the unity which is Rome.
Look about you and look at yourselves,
And see the greatness of Rome.
Two hundred years ago
the Goules were our fiercest enemies.
Now we greet them as friends.
In the whole world,
Only two small frontiers
are still hostile to us.
One here in the north which separates us
From those who are called barbarians,
The other in the east Persia.
Only on these two borders will you find
Walls, palisades,
Forts and hatred.
But these are not
the frontiers Rome wants.
Rome wants and needs human frontiers.
We had to fight long wars.
Your burdens had been great.
But we come now to the
End of the road.
Here!
Within our reach
golden century of peace.
A true Pax Romana.
Wherever you live,
Whatever the color of your skin.
When peace is achieved,
It will bring to all,
All!
The supreme rights of Roman citizenship.
My lord, Caesar. Are you ill?
A small pain in my side. It will pass.
No longer provinces, all colonies
But Rome,
Rome everywhere.
A family of equal nations.
That is what lies ahead.
May God hastens the day.
Lucila,
Each time I see you
I wondered how it is possible,
I fathered something so beautiful.
You make it hard for me
to take leave of this life.
Father,
You have a long life ahead of you.
Death is in the order of things.
Didn't they teach you that in school?
I will not let you leave me.
Is there a choice?
Soon this trickle of blood,
This few bones,
This net woven with nerves
and arteries will be dust.
No choice.
Now that I'm here.
I will see that
You take better care of yourself.
Even so,
Time is short.
And there is a decision
which I can no longer delay.
I have sacrificed the love of my son.
Comadeus will never be my heir.
Levius,
My wish that you should succeed me.
And I intend to present you
to the leaders of the empire
Openly as my successor.
But,
You said yourself, Caesar.
It needs someone who will change,
Who will find your ways.
A man of the tenth century of Rome.
I know only the ways of war.
I would not know how to make allies
out of the barbarians.
You will find your ways.
I have a heart for you, Levius.
But Comadeus already
shares the throne with you.
I have hope that the position and
Responsibilities would make him grow up
But he is interested only
in games and gladiators.
It was you Caesar
who brought me into your family.
Comadeus and I are like brother.
I love Comadeus, too.
But that's just a feeling.
A personal feeling.
My lord, Caesar.
Price Comadeus sent you his greetings.
He is in the snow country,
Two days journey from here.
Perhaps, I should meet Comadeus
My lord, Caesar.
Yes, Levius. Go and meet him.
And think about what I said
but remember my time is short.
Even though Comadeus is my brother,
I would have done as you did, father.
And would you also have chosen Levius?
Yes!
Yes.
Only...
Why did he hesitate?
If it not been the kind of man
who hesitate when face
With such a great responsibility
I would not have chosen him.
Come, sit by me.
Let me look at you.
Are you happy?
You seem reasonably happy, and yet...
And yet, father.
A disturbing whisper reached me
That you thought once of retiring to
the temple of Vesta.
I know it is too simple to think of life
As I the beautiful or ugly.
There was a time
When life seemed very ugly to me.
Is it because of your mother?
I was ashamed.
She brought you such pain.
I knew moments of happiness with her,
And beauty.
But she looked for lovers elsewhere,
Since she could not love me.
You're the best. The greatest of men.
Is that the way it must be, father?
Only moments of beauty
And then betrayal.
We must try to
understand other people more.
Understand cruelty and weakness.
Even that.
You have such a gift for life, Lucila,
But I think you ask too much of it.
Learn pity.
Learn to have compassion.
To yourself, too.
Pity and compassion to yourself.
The future will make
great demands on you.
Oh, father.
Levius!
Levius!
Levius!
Comadeus!
Comadeus!
Levius!
Galius Levius, warrior, voyager.
Comadeus, Comadeus.
Most strongest of them all.
I miss you!
Are you well?
I never am well!
I have much to tell you.
And I you!
We both come up from Rome.
To the honors,
Matches, glorious.
Father.
I've seen too little of you.
That was not my wish.
Nor mine.
But this wars have been endless.
Endless because,
You were too gentle.
I would have fought
these wars differently.
There's a lot we do
differently Comadeus.
I wish you could have
come to Rome more often.
As a new generation,
there's a whole new feeling.
You mean I'm getting old,
senile perhaps.
Rome has changed since you were there.
Rome has changed.
It is now crawling with gladiators.
Sister,
I thought you retired as a Vesta virgin.
And abandon Rome
to you and your athlete.
Female philosopher.
As I remembered, you two
began to quarrel as soon as
You could walk. I expect you're tired.
And thirsty.
We'll talk together soon.
Come let us find someone...
Vitorious Poliminus and Victorinus,
We have fought four campaigns together.
Felibus, the greatest
gladiator of all Rome,
Survivor of a hundred combats.
We've come to fight your battles.
Gladiators to fight us soldiers...
Why not?
We'll teach your legions how to kill.
Have some wine.
Marcus Aurelius, our Caesar
Does not look well.
Dying man never do.
But you knew Caesar was dying
where else could have
Pulled you and your kind away
from the city of Rome.
You know, Levius.
It's when I'm with you,
I feel... good.
Safe.
Don't ever change.
Caesar was just telling me
I should change.
Oh father thinks too much.
As much for a Roman
to think of these days.
Why Levius,
For a moment that honest warrior's face
Of yours took on a philosopher's role
Let's not think, let's drink.
As in the old days?
As in the old days.
Did you study logic?
Do you know what a dilemma is?
A dilemma.
Is...
When we have two possibilities
and both of them are impossible.
That is the norm
Drink with me.
Now drink with me.
Drink with me!
I'm Caesar's son,
I can have you burned alive!
Why Levius.
My friend.
My brother.
Something is struggling you, isn't it?
Your father,
Have asked me...
To be his heir.
My own father.
But I'm his son.
He must hate me very much.
He does not hate you.
I did not ask for this, Comadeus.
Nor did you refuse.
Ask me to refuse!
Ask you?
If you listen carefully.
You will hear the gods...
You will hear the gods laughing.
I do not hear them laughing.
You will do what the gods decide!
She is for you.
She thinks.
Levius.
Levius.
Lucila.
Lucila!
Have you finished
with Comadeus and wine?
My world has suddenly become strange.
I'm not sure where I am.
I'm sure of only one thing.
I love you, Lucila.
If you are so sure,
Why did it take you so long?
I think I must have known
all these years.
I must have been certain
that one day this will happen.
No, we have not known.
No and not know.
How can that be?
I'm not sure how it was.
But I know now.
You were always with me.
Everywhere.
I took you in the battle with me.
You were with me in the gold fields.
But you know this.
Only this.
I know this.
You were with me, too.
Always!
There were times when I wanted to
run away from life,
I did not because I told myself that
One day
You will be with me.
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.
I love you.
Do you, Levius?
Bring him back to me safely.
Bring him back to me quickly.
Make him love me forever.
Get these men back behind the lines.
We're setting a trap for Balimar.
I will lead the attack.
The men we sent first at the battle
Will be used as bait.
Many will die.
It will be specially
dangerous for their leader.
We will be the first into this battle.
We will be your bait.
And if I die,
then the gods are not with me.
Then Levius, my friend,
My brother.
Will it not relieve you
of a great burden?
As a command
you will lead your men forward.
You will move deeper
and deeper into that forest
Until the barbarians are convinced
That it is safe to attack.
You will stand and hold until
We move in and close the trap.
We will stand and hold.
Balimar!
Balimar has escaped
Because some of your gladiators
we cowards.
Father...
Father.
It has been decided, Lucila.
Armenian throne would become even closer
A part of Rome,
A lovely part,
Will become Armenia.
Lucila,
I want you to take care of these.
I wrote them while campaigning
in these forests.
I will watch over them, father.
I have tried to convince myself,
But my fears for
the empire are unreasonable.
But my fears are reasonable.
The east, Lucila
is where the danger lies.
We must make an alliance
that will show the whole world
What value Rome places on
her eastern frontier.
An alliance with Armenia.
And so...
Caesar must give his daughter
in marriage
To the king of Armenia.
I had hopes that the gods would be kind.
I had hope that you would not
have a marriage without love.
Father...
You know better than anyone
What a marriage without love can mean.
Yes.
Yes. I do.
I know you love me.
Therefore...
Therefore, if you asked me,
It can only mean that you must
have tried with all your strength
To find another way.
Yes, I have.
And you could not.
No...
I could not.
Therefore, it must be time.
Does...
Does Rome punish cowards?
Stop this!
Stop this! Stop this!
You cruelest cowards!
Let 20 of your men fight 20 of ours.
If they dare unless you are cowards.
Move out of the way!
No one touches, Berilus!
I am the commander of the northern army.
Continue the punishment.
I will not permit this!
Withdraw, Comadeus!
I cannot.
Nor can I.
Then let the gods decide.
Yes, the omens had been bad.
Bad for whom?
For us, for Rome.
At least here we can speak clearly.
What would you like, Julianas,
That the gods sent us written messages
Advising us on each small move we make.
Is the murder of an emperor
A small move?
Richard.
Caesar is dying and he knows it.
At any moment, he will disinherit
Comadeus and proclaim
Levius his heir.
Once he does that publicly.
What hope is there for us?
To kill Caesar.
Does Comadeus know?
No.
He must never know.
Caesar's gone.
There are so many close to him.
How could it be done?
Quite easily.
We always know that Caesar loves fruit.
Apple.
Now this blade carries a deadly poison.
On the side with the carved snake.
Cut fruit with it, an apple.
Offer the poison half to Caesar,
Eat the other half for yourself,
Then long live the emperor, Comadeus.
It could be done
before hundreds of witnesses.
No one could be suspected.
From whom will Caesar accept fruit?
Who is close enough to him.
I am.
You!
You are blind.
I have only to feel the blade
and know its side.
And who better than a blind man.
Are you a man to enjoy
an irony Marcus Aurelius?
Look well then
at the emperor of all Rome
Become no better than a slave.
And who or what is your master.
Slave!
A small point in your side.
Perhaps not larger than
a grain of wheat.
Of what use is your wisdom now.
No answer.
Think of all you've read
and pondered over the years.
And the talk, Marcus Aurelius.
The hours of talk with your friend,
Themonitus.
Surely it must have prepared you
for this moment.
But it has failed you, hasn't it?
You are not prepared.
Why?
In all that talk did this
is this topic dead,
Slip your mind
or did you know deep down
That your wisdom would be helpless
before this mystery.
Of mysteries.
But once you have admit that
All other knowledge and skills
Become trivial and meaningless.
But then you will not help
thought and read
And talk and wonder.
So, perhaps it is just as well.
For if men do not think greed,
Talk to each other
Above all else, talk.
There are no longer men.
He has come for me.
The silent boat will ferry me across
The shadow of river.
I am not ready for you.
I've always been willing
to bargain with my enemies.
Can we not make a treaty.
For your part I asked you
to wait two years.
One year.
I cannot do it in less than a year.
I do not seek pleasure
or friendship or love.
I speak only of Rome.
And when I say Rome, I mean the world.
The future.
For my part
I am prepared to live on in pain.
A year. What is a year to you?
Stupid thing.
And it was I who said,
It is not in the nature
Of fig tree to be a fig as for
honey bees to give honey,
And for the lion who fall upon the land.
So it is in the way of things
that you should come for me.
Forgive me, Berklin.
I did not realize you were blind
and deaf
Come for me when you will.
My hand shall lead us.
But I tell you this
That it is a great truth
that we have not yet divined.
Oh, it is you Cleanda.
Is there something
I can do my lord Caesar?
I'm in pain.
The Greeks say there is nothing better
than fruit to soften pain.
Share this with me.
I have been engaged to king Hamus.
But you are mine.
My father gave his word.
Come away with me.
Where could we go?
Anywhere where we could be alone.
But there is no such a place.
I'm Caesar's daughter.
A woman...
That is much higher rank.
I couldn't live that way.
Nor could you.
I could.
I have to choose between
being Caesar's heir or your love.
I choose your love.
I cannot.
How can you do anything else?
Only this is real.
All else is half-life.
A dream. Only this.
How can you ask me
to forget everything I am?
All that my life means.
How could your life
mean anything without love?
I will not let this happen.
Father,
Why did you deny me?
Caesar is dying!
Father.
Levius.
You are looking for
a document Themonitus?
A document in which my father
named me his heir.
There is no such document.
There must be.
His last word was Levius.
I will bare witness.
And it was Caesar's wish
That you be his heir.
