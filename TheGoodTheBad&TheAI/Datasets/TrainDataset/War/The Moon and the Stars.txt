Villa del Impera,
Il Duce
Oggi...
And now, to end,
I would like to introduce
a young actor,
Renzo Davario,
who is playing Spoletta.
And it is very exciting
to introduce new talent
because they are,
of course,
the future of
the film business.
It's the
boyfriend of the producer.
Light! Ha!
First film?
Yes. Uh--
Oh, Mr. Clavel?
- Yes?
Are you excited
to be working
with a great producer
like Mr. Rieti?
Producers are
all the same to me, dear.
About as much use as
a eunuch in a brothel.
Kristina.
Otto. I didn't think
you'd have time to come.
I always have time
for you, my dear.
Besides, your participation
in this film
strengthens the relationship
between two great nations.
That sounds like
something from a publicity handout.
It is. But it's
true, nonetheless.
Any news from Siegfried?
I think he's in Prague.
But, then,
you know that,
don't you?
I promised him
I'd look after you
whilst you are here.
If there is anything
you need during your stay,
call me.
Thank you.
Let me talk to Davide.
- No.
Fired his own wife
because--
whew-- just a moment.
Davide.
You were very crude
to that poor girl.
You didn't introduce her
with the rest of the cast.
But she only has a small part--
- No, no, no, no!
I want her to be seen!
All right--
Maria Grazia
has quite a future.
Quite a body, too.
Just gossip.
Then can I count on you?
Of course.
You and I
are in the same boat.
And don't forget it.
Don't worry.
I've talked to Davide.
It's okay.
There you are, dear.
I just wanted to say
I'm very happy to
be working with you.
Oh, thank you.
I hate drinking
orange juice,
but it's better
than standing here
empty-handed, hmm?
And, uh,
I'd better tell you
before anybody else does.
I'm a part-time alcoholic,
full-time morphine addict.
Is that what they call
the English humor?
Yeah. Yeah, it could be,
except that it's true.
No. Sorry.
I don't get it. Uh,
this is embarrassing
for me.
Oh, God,
don't be embarrassed.
No, I'm never embarrassed,
except at having
to work in movies.
Why do it, then?
The money, dear.
The money!
You're shocked!
I'm just trying
to make conversation.
Now-- Now, what I really
like is the theater.
You know?
Being on stage?
It's-- It's a passion.
It's being alive!
Mmm? Ha ha.
No, no.
Anybody can do movies.
You should have seen
my
Audience were
with me all the way.
Managed to shake them off
at the station.
Ah, God. Movies are
second best at best.
You don't like film!
Oh, God. What's to like?
Well, it's the art
of the people!
No. People? God--
Frankly, meeting you
has been a great
disappointment.
Ha!
Thank you--
- Miss Baumgarten.
I swore I'd shoot myself
if I didn't have the courage
to talk to you in 10 seconds.
- And did you?
No, it took me 20.
See, I'm not capable
of dying for you.
How old are you?
- Um,
older than the Sphinx.
I have something
to tell you.
On day, I'll write
the conversations
between the voices
in my head
and send them to you.
Are you Catholic?
No. Protestant.
That's a problem.
My family have been
leading Catholics
for centuries.
But you'll convert.
I believe in the
teachings of the Church,
even though I get my mother
to go to Mass for me.
So we'll be all right.
What are you raving about?
Our marriage, of course.
Oh, you're crazy, obviously--
- How?
How do you know?
That's what everybody says.
I'm married.
I have a wonderful child.
Who the devil are you?
Marcantonio Altieri.
What do you want?
Nothing. I--
- Good.
Everything.
Everything!
Miss Baumgarten,
Are you free
this evening?
Of course.
I thought perhaps you were
going to a fancy dress party,
in that costume of yours.
This is the uniform
of a fascist,
and I'm proud of it.
Oh, I'm only saying
I don't think
a black shirt suits you.
It's what I believe in.
Then why did you get me
to order you three suits
and a dinner jacket
from Caraceni?
A gifted young actor
must have a wardrobe.
Remember?
- Mm,
you are not an actor,
and you are not a fascist.
You know what you are.
I wouldn't spell it out,
if I were you.
No, you're right.
It doesn't do
to name things,
but I'm very
fond of you.
That's unfortunate,
isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I want a softer seam,
Daisy.
Well, I can take half
an inch off the hem,
and, ooh, tighten
this waistband,
get rid of these
bloody wrinkles.
Lengthen it an inch here.
Only the front.
The back's all right.
Well, I'm glad
something's right.
Ta-da!
Oh!
What do you think? Hm?
It's a bit tight,
but I'll lose weight.
Jamie Clavel,
you old tosspot.
Daisy, you horse's ass.
Good God. Mmmm!
Haven't seen you
since when?
Another British
film classic.
Closer! Closer. Here--
What are you doing
in this hellhole?
Working. You get it
when and where you can.
Yeah. Europe's a
dangerous place to be, you know?
I'm English. They
wouldn't dare touch me.
I wouldn't
count on it, dear.
Would you have a drink later?
- Yeah.
Daisy?
Daisy.
- Mm--
Yes, I think it's fine.
And we can break it
down a bit.
Now can we see you
with James?
Yes, of course.
What have you
heard of a young man
called Marcantonio Altieri?
Everyone in Rome's
heard of Master Altieri.
Yes, well,
he's pestering me.
He follows me
everywhere in his car.
I don't know what to do.
I should accept his devotion
as a mystic offer.
His gifts will
shortly follow.
I don't want his gifts.
Uhhn!
What?
- He's there again.
I have to get out of here.
Come with me.
I am the master
of evasion.
And your husband.
Was it Tristan?
Almost. Siegfried.
Is he a Nazi?
He's high up in the party.
Why do you ask?
Sooner or later, you and I
will end up enemies.
Ah, but we already are.
I'm Tosca, and sooner
or later, I stab you.
Really
must read the script.
I won't sign
any more checks.
I'd rather put
my hand in a cast.
It's only Tuesday.
They'll keep us
rolling till Friday.
I can't do somersaults!
You must, my dear Gargano.
It's a circus.
Come. Nicoli.
Jump here.
Now mark it.
Molnár,
for Christ's sake,
can you get this bloody woman
to do something about this--
What is it, James?
- I am not--
All right. I'm sorry,
darling. Carry on.
Can we do the scene,
please?
Jesus Christ!
Just want to do my job!
Mario.
You have enslaved
my heart forever.
Lovely Tosca.
No, no!
Not yet. Not yet.
I should be playing
Cavaradossi.
Ligouri looks like
a car salesman.
If he still has his pants on
in the second scene,
he's in the wrong film.
At least you've got
some lines.
I'll be lucky
to get a close-up.
Work!
Let's make a start.
Are you ready?
- Ready, ready.
Ready to roll?
- Ready, ready.
Roll camera.
Clapper board, please.
Scene 24, take 1!
Action!
Mario?
Tosca.
You have enslaved
my heart forever.
Lovely Tosca.
I am your Tosca.
I'm yours forever.
Cut!
Is something
wrong, Kristina?
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm sorry, Lázló.
Let's just go again.
Relax.
Just get rid of that boy!
First positions!
Get out! Stand by.
First positions!
We go again right away!
Quiet!
Are you ready?
You idiot!
Scene 26, take 2!
Action!
Don't panic! Don't panic!
Fire!
No.
- Come on. Come with me.
Watch out! Watch out!
Come on! Quick! Quick!
Stop acting like
stunned mullets!
It was him!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Jesus Christ!
Don't you bloody
Germans knock
before you enter
a gentleman's room?
Well, I didn't know
what you were doing.
Exactly.
You didn't know.
Now you do.
Don't look so shocked.
I told you what it was.
Well, I didn't believe you.
I thought you were joking.
Why are you looking
so surprised, anyway?
Must have seen this
kind of thing before.
Berlin was the city
of decadence in my day.
You obviously haven't
been there for years.
The Führer's cleaned it up.
First Berlin,
tomorrow the world.
Bloody marvelous.
What the hell did you come
barging in here for, anyway?
That madman Marcantonio.
He just tried to set
fire to the set.
He what?
Jesus Christ! Why?
Well, I don't know,
but it's frightening!
Oh, God!
Must have been
a declaration of love.
Oh, what? Setting fire
to a studio?
I love you so much,
I set-a fire to myself,
huh?
This is all a big joke
to you, isn't it, James?
Ohh! So annoying!
English pig!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, Funaro. I'm
losing days of shooting!
The fresco
has to be repainted!
It's what I pay you
insurance for.
You are forgetting
it wasn't an accident.
And what do you call it?
An act of God?
A lunatic set fire
to the studio!
You can claim damages
from his family if you like,
but meanwhile, pay me!
The Artieri family aren't
as rich as you think.
We'll put in a claim.
But meanwhile, you might
have to wait for your money.
Funaro.
We have always done
business in the past.
And I believe we will
do business in the future.
Or will we?
You like it?
Uh-huh.
This will look
perfect in your bedroom.
You think so?
Isn't it a little obscene?
No. Funaro.
Art is never obscene.
It's true. It's true.
A gift.
And we are agreed
on the insurance.
Yes.
Perhaps
a little on account?
You are a great producer, Davide,
but my company
would go bankrupt
if they were all
like you.
That'll be the day,
when an insurance company
goes bankrupt.
Be nice.
Oh, come here.
Will the accident hold you up?
Only for a day.
Maria Grazia is
very disappointed.
Hm.
- She cries in the night.
Comfort her.
- She doesn't feel appreciated.
She wants more close-ups.
I'll have a word
with our director.
A word of advice, old friend.
You are being too obvious
with that boy.
I won't allow anyone
to control
or have any influence
over my private life.
I might have to.
There's a morality campaign
to clean up
the film business.
So you have to be careful.
Don't forget, you being
a Jew makes you vulnerable.
Oh, you're going to protect me.
It's what I pay you for.
I can only protect you
up to a point.
So please be discreet.
Why do I stay in Italy?
The money?
- No. I could make money anywhere.
I stay because
I want to make films.
That's all I want to do.
Remember what I said.
We wouldn't want
to lose you.
I value our friendship.
And the income.
Of course.
That makes our friendship
even more valuable.
And don't forget about poor Maria Grazia!
- Mm!
Close-ups by the score.
Close-ups. Close-ups.
Why are you still
wearing this uniform?
It's become a mania
with you.
You have other suits.
Look good
and dressing well
is essential for
an Italian on the make.
I've sold them.
Why?
Gambling.
I still haven't paid
off all my debts.
I need 500.
If I told you
I didn't have it,
you wouldn't believe me.
Davide--
I need 500 now.
A debt for a fascist
is a question of honor.
Is that why
you wear the uniform?
To prove to the world that you
are a fascist and a man of honor?
Of course not.
But, if you
can't help me,
I understand.
Perhaps you need this
more than I do right now.
Thanks, Davide.
I'll see you.
Scarpia.
Tosca.
You have the safe conduct?
Of course.
Here it is.
Signed and sealed,
as promised.
When you took that letter
from me, you became mine.
What do you have
for me in return?
Why did you do that?
Because I know
when you've had me,
you'll cancel the safe contact.
This way, you
won't get the chance.
You didn't trust me?
You're in the right place
to die, Scarpia.
Ohh!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Cut.
Very good!
That's a print!
Great.
You were marvelous, James.
Thank you, László.
Take five minutes.
No, no.
Let's make it ten.
The fresco Christ
and the knife.
Did you see?
How carefully he
covers their scenes.
He hasn't given me
a close-up yet.
I'll have a word
with Davide about it.
Don't bother.
He doesn't give
a damn about us.
A quick word?
- Can't it wait?
Lázló, can I be
honest with you?
Whenever a producer
says that,
I break out in a cold sweat.
- No, no.
Everything is beautiful.
Every frame
is an old master.
But you are making
too many of them.
Listen, dear. Don't
teach me my profession.
In Hungary, cinema
is done with close-ups,
as in the Soviet Union.
Molnár is saying this,
and he learned film
language in Budapest,
from Curtiz.
- Now who is Curtiz?
You might know him
as Michael Curtiz.
Ah.
A great director.
Yes. Also
He's Hungarian.
- Lázló, stop.
This is very interesting.
Hmm.
But in Italy, cinema
is made with money.
Prieti is saying this.
And unfortunately, we have
less and less of it.
The dailies, my friend,
are beautiful. Beautiful!
But you are taking too long.
If you are trying
to frighten me,
you are doing a good job.
- No! No.
No, no, no, no, no.
The bank has agreed
to sign the contract.
But we have to
stay on schedule.
We can't afford
any mistakes.
Germany's about
to invade Poland.
Nobody's interested
in making movies.
Oh! We'll make them interested.
- How?
I've got this idea.
In the love scenes between
Kristina and young Ligouri,
I'll get Kristina
to play it naked.
Naked?
It will be worth millions
at the box office!
Completely naked?
Yes. Almost.
You would see her breasts!
- Both of them?
Yes.
- Have you spoken to Kristina about this?
No! But I will!
At the right time.
Good luck.
It's mad.
But it's a mad business.
Chop-chop!
Liberty!
And we shall die fighting!
Too much smoke.
Kill the smoke!
What happened?
Are you all right?
Sorry! Sorry,
I'm choking--
Cut! Get out! Get out!
Cut!
Did you get it?
- Yes.
Great!
Print first and last.
Okay!
I think that completes it.
No more close-ups.
Let's move on.
I picked them up from
the printers this morning.
You'll find they're just classical.
- Excellent.
Uh, thank you
for saving me
from that madman
the other day.
I just pointed you
to the exit.
Well, I'm grateful.
That boy's crazy
and dangerous.
Anyone would
have done it.
Uh, don't worry.
I--
I didn't see a thing.
Have you seen
Oh, I'm surprised you have
time to read that trash.
There's a piece about you.
I don't care what
they say about me,
as long as they
say something.
You should care.
You should sue them.
A Jewish producer suing a fascist rag.
That will be the day.
It says everyone
knows you are Jewish.
And it talks about
your private life.
You and Renzo.
Well, if
continues to publish
slanderous columns
about me, I will have to--
cancel my subscription.
It's no joke.
I know.
It accuses us of being
a cosmopolitan crew.
Full of degenerate
subversives.
They even take it out
on me for being Hungarian.
If they knew
the whole story--
What am I supposed
to do? Fire you?
No. But you can
fire Marchesini up there.
Marchesini? He's my
best set painter.
He's an anti-fascist!
- We all are.
I know that. But he
does something about it,
instead of sitting
on his fat ass,
like the rest of us,
complain in whispers
behind closed doors.
Shit.
Identification, please.
Visitors are reminded to
be brief and to the point.
The minister
has no time to waste.
Neither do I.
I'm in the middle of making a film.
Ah, I know!
My brother-in-law's
in it.
He's the officer who
executes Cavaradossi.
He has dialogue.
He says "Shoot."
Wasn't it enough
for you to be a Jew?
Did you have to be
a homosexual as well?
Just don't tell me
you're a Freemason!
You're a standing provocation
to the Secret Police.
reporters.
Nothing.
But are you sure
of Renzo?
What do you mean?
Are you sure he's not
an over-informer?
Are you sure of Maria?
What are you saying?
I'm saying sooner or later,
Maria will end up
in bed with Renzo.
Those two
have grandiose ideas.
I wouldn't be surprised
if, between them,
they--
they drop us both!
How could Maria drop me?
I pay you protection money!
Only the two of us
know that. Mm?
Unfortunately,
Renzo knows it, too.
What?
I talk in my sleep.
If Renzo knows,
then Maria knows, too.
No. Maria won't tell.
You trust her?
I love--
I'm besotted with her,
but I don't trust her.
She won't tell because
she will be dead if--
You'd kill her?
Like that.
But you say you love her.
Ha! I do. I do.
For now.
But I love money
always.
Just make that poisonous
pen shut up about us!
Or it puts us all in danger,
especially the film!
Your big checks keep coming
only if the film is finished.
Davide.
The banks want to pull out.
Because of the article?
Yes. They are scared.
I have reviewed
the evidence.
You are an enemy
of the state.
The sentence
of this court
is that you
be taken out
and shot.
You call this
not an injustice?
No, no.
I call it state justice.
A different thing,
my dear friend.
Take him away.
You're next.
You will not
be tried today.
Why not?
- You are too well known.
Besides,
I have other
plans for you.
Cut!
Yeah?
Kristina's close-up.
Clavel and Ligouri.
Quick quick! Chop-chop!
Daisy! Daisy!
Too hot here.
Cut! Cut!
Please, don't-- darling.
Every time I come to Rome,
I feel as if
I'm in the middle
of some huge film set,
flooded with light.
You know, I'm starting
to feel homesick
for the gray skies
of Berlin.
Really? Well, I feel
quite at home here.
An English tea room
in the heart of Rome,
a stone's throw from
where Shelley used to live,
a hundred years ago.
I met a traveler from
an antique land who said,
"Two large
and limbless legs
of stone stand
in the desert."
Have you read Shelley?
- No.
And on the pedestal,
these words appear:
My name is Ozymandius,
king of kings:
Look on my works,
ye Mighty, and despair.
Nothing beside remains.
Round the decay
of that colossal wreck,
Boundless and bare,
the low and level sands
stretch far away.
I saw you do that
in a film once.
Oh.
Yes, but I do it even when
the cameras aren't rolling.
Do you think
that rotten article
will cause problems
for the film?
Well, if it was authorized
by someone high up,
yes, we do have a problem.
I felt so sorry
for Rieti.
I mean, nobody's got the right
to trample on a person like that.
I don't suppose your husband
would agree with you.
I don't think
he'd mind so much.
He never listens
to what I say.
Do you have a wife
and children?
Three daughters.
Susan, Jennifer,
and Madeline.
My wife-- she's been
in a mental hospital
for fifteen years.
Madeline,
she's the eldest.
She looks
after the house.
And me,
to a certain extent.
Well, it's thanks to her
I've stopped serial drinking.
She doesn't know
about the morphine.
Well, at least
I hope she doesn't.
I got married
when I was 18
and didn't know
any better.
My husband is 10 years
older than me.
I looked up to him.
I work in films,
and Siegfried
works for the party.
We share the same roof,
that's all.
Why do you stay with him?
I don't want my son
to pay for my mistake.
And he would. The party
would see to that.
Oh, no. No. No. No.
No. Look. It's, uh--
look, you see?
It's jam first.
Then the cream.
It's a trick
you learn in England.
You see?
I'm glad you asked
for a truce.
Here.
I'd never go to bed
with a Jew.
Why not?
They put our Lord
on the cross.
That was before my time.
They didn't do it to me.
That's what counts.
They will.
Davide has been
very good to me.
He picked me up
from the gutter.
Without him, I'd probably
be in prison by now.
You are stupid.
Why?
Because they take advantage
of your beauty and youth.
That's all they want.
They don't want us.
We're just merchandise.
Something they buy
and throw away
when they get bored.
And you are grateful.
I'm not grateful.
Merolle is a disgusting,
sweaty old pig.
He doesn't look like that
when you're with him.
Tell me you are jealous.
What would you do to keep
Merolle away from me?
What would you do
to keep Davide from me?
Oh, Renzo.
Keep still.
How much did that
reporter give you
to tell him all that filth
about Davide and me?
I didn't.
But you are the only one
who knew those details.
So what?
Shit!
Look!
Look what you've done!
I'm bleeding!
You deserve worse.
- You bastard.
Renzo, I'm poor.
We are both dirt-poor.
We understand
each other, don't we?
I understand
that you betrayed me
and a friend of mine.
Your lover
gives you nothing!
The reporter gave me
That's 500 for you, Renzo.
Don't say another word.
Or I'll kill you.
#
I thought you
weren't coming.
I changed my mind.
#
#
Hello.
There is a saying in Rome
that if you're not dead,
you'll meet again,
and since we're not dead,
we meet again.
Get out of my bed.
I can't. I'm naked
under the sheet.
I threw all my clothes
out of the window,
except my socks.
A man with honor cannot walk
around without his socks,
and mine are
monogrammed.
You're crazy.
You're wrong.
And I have a certificate
to prove it.
They let me out of
the clinic this morning,
with the doctors
waving good-bye
and the nurses
throwing roses.
Who are you calling,
my love?
The hotel manager.
Then I shall leave,
singing.
They'll take me
to the border.
What border?
The border. The border.
There is always a border
between here and there.
They tried last year,
when everybody was shouting
"Long live Mussolini."
I was shouting "Long live
Mahatma Ghandi."
I like to provoke,
stir the blood.
Why?
Because you weren't there.
I love you, Kristina.
That's the explanation
for everything.
You're the light of my life.
Please. Will you leave?
Will you promise
to meet me again?
Hello. Yes. This is
Kristina Baumgarten here.
Don't turn around.
There's somebody in my room.
He's in my bed.
What?
I told you
not to turn around.
A gentleman must
never shock a lady.
Till we meet again, my love.
Till we meet again.
Oh! My God.
I'm working for
the government,
and I ran into a tree.
Please order me a taxi.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry.
Is that your friend?
Yes, Otto.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Bad news?
My husband.
He's been wounded.
I-- oh, my God.
Badly?
No. It's not too serious.
Good. Are you
going to see him?
No. I'm staying
with the film.
Here.
Let me get you
back to the studio.
Yes. I'll breathe
easier there.
Our little bubble
of unreality.
Oh, I, uh--
I heard about your friend.
The loony Altieri.
Hmm.
Is it true? He only
had his socks on?
And a top hat.
My God.
A large one, I hope.
Come to here. See?
Yes, yes.
Bloody marvelous!
Thank you.
- Fantastic. That was fantastic.
Oh, really?
Kristina, I'm sorry to
hear about your husband.
Will you need a few days
off to go and see him?
No, thank you.
We've, uh--
we've talked about it.
We both feel
my duty's here.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Thank you. I'm very grateful
We would have been completely
lost if you decided to go.
Oh, well, I would
never do that.
When I sign a contract
or make a promise,
I stick with it.
Same with me.
- Uh-huh.
It's hard to find people
you can lean on and trust.
Mm.
- You can lean on me, dear.
Ha ha ha.
Final text!
Yes. Fine. Well--
I'll be around.
Marchesini! Marchesini!
Uh, you dropped this.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
Is that your son?
Yes, it is.
How old is he?
He's 8.
Mine's 10.
It's a pity they are made
to march in parades
and go to war.
Yes.
It is.
Kristina!
We are waiting!
Quiet!
Let's go.
I know!
Let's go.
We are losing the sun.
Good, Alfonso.
Go to your marks.
Camera ready?
Sound? Speed?
- Ready.
Roll camera!
Action!
Captain! Captain! No!
I have a stay
of execution!
A reprieve, signed
by Governor Scarpia!
No.
- What's wrong with it?
He hasn't signed it.
But he meant to!
Go ask him!
I can't, madam.
Men!
- No!
Resume firing positions!
- No! I won't let you!
Tosca--
- Cavaradossi, my love!
All right, men!
- No!
Ready!
- Let him go!
Take aim! Fire!
Cut!
Beautiful.
Beautiful!
A good master.
- Yes.
I want lots of cover.
Guns. Triggers.
Flowing body blood.
Et cetera, et cetera.
Montage.
I must have an edited
sequence for Monday.
If Kunz is moved by it,
we're saved.
The bankers
will listen to him.
Not a dry eye.
I guarantee.
We're seeing him tonight.
Talk to him
about the film.
What do you want me to say
about my masterpiece?
No, don't say masterpiece.
Just say it'll make
a lot of money.
And how are you,
my dear?
I'm all right.
Listen, I'm having--
I'm giving a little party
at my house tonight.
I would be delighted
if you would attend.
Oh, yes!
It's in honor of Arthur Kunz.
The Swiss banker.
Oh. Is he any relation to
the pianist Charlie Kunz?
I don't think so.
- Oh...
He's a favorite of mine.
He wrote "Clap Hands,
Here Comes Charlie".
Make up! Go now, go now.
Everybody--
Quiet!
Quiet, everyone!
Who the devil are you?
You are trespassing.
Out.
Are you the boss?
I'm the director.
Hmph. We are looking
for Francesco Marchesini.
Marchesini?
Marchesini?
There are some people
here for you--
What do you want with
Signore Marchesini?
He's wanted for questioning.
No, we need him here.
I'll stand guarantee
for him.
Don't make me laugh.
I will be all right.
Thank you, sir.
You're coming with us.
You're nothing
but bully boys.
Have you got
something to say?
My mother always
taught me to be polite.
But there's no need
to smile at policemen.
You are in the real
world now, Marchesini,
where we can do what we like.
Take him away.
You are very fortunate
to spend half your time
in Rome, and keep
your base in Zurich.
To be safe
in Europe today,
you have to have
two houses.
Rome has the Vatican
to protect us,
and Zurich has the
Union of Swiss Banks.
Money and religion.
They both guarantee
a kind of immunity.
Have you ever thought of
migrating to safer climes?
No. Rome is my home.
It's not safe
for a man like you.
Aren't you afraid?
It's not courage.
It's a sort of blindness.
A sense of
"It can't happen to me."
Why? Because you are
a film producer?
Yeah.
Ah. I'm gonna
suck your blood.
Would Mr. Arthur Kunz
dance to a song
by Mr. Charlie Kunz?
Ho ho!
There's no relation,
as far as I know!
But I'll gladly dance
with a beautiful
young woman.
Do you think
he'll help, boss?
Yes. If he thinks
he can make a profit.
So, can you see the
ghosts in the square?
Oh...
Yes! I can.
- Mm-hm.
And you can stop lusting
after it, Tumiati.
It's not for sale.
A good gallery owner must,
above all, be patient.
Oh, I'm sorry Kristina
couldn't be at the party.
She got word from
the German Embassy.
Her husband's
in active service.
He was wounded
in the leg.
Oh. Can I use that for my book?
- Certainly.
But the German Embassy
won't like it.
They don't like publicity
about their soldiers
being wounded or killed.
Oh. Yes.
I understand.
So you're telling me
that the storm troopers
never die?
Marchesini helped me
when I was in trouble.
He seems like a good person.
He isn't accused of being bad.
Just anti-fascist.
Well, he must have
done something wrong.
Mm! Oh, yes. Sorry.
I forgot I was dining
with the Marie Antoinette
of the Third Reich.
It's not that bad.
I don't say
they should eat cake.
I'm just trying to
understand what's going on.
Ah. The real world is creeping
into our little bubble.
Outside, Czechoslovakia
has been invaded by Germany.
Italy's occupying Albania.
Pretty soon, the whole
of Europe will be at war.
And if we're not careful,
some of us will be
caught far from home.
Anyway,
I'm still asking myself
what I'm doing here with you.
Are you?
- Yes!
I like women who laugh.
You don't laugh nearly enough!
I prefer blondes.
You're a brunette.
I like women who are
medium height,
rounded,
uncomplicated.
You're tall, slender,
and subtle.
Well, I-- I can't say
a nihilistic, alcoholic
morphine addict
is my kind of man.
Thank you very much.
So,
what are your plans
after the film's finished?
Uh, I don't know.
This, um,
Rattigan chap's got a new
play on the West End.
I think I rather blotted my
copy book in that department.
Anyway,
I don't think
that far ahead.
Out of my way!
Make way
for our Abyssinian heroes!
There goes the ambiance.
Just pretend
they don't exist.
Just look at me, James.
Look at 'em. Eh?
Bloody toy soldiers.
No, and don't
drink so much.
You said just a drop
to keep me company.
This one changed
my mind, all right?
What would you like?
Something special!
Karlina, you're
needed in the kitchen.
I will take their order.
James, it's all right.
Just
look at me
and talk to me. Mm?
Someone told us
that you had a new waitress.
They didn't say
she was so pretty.
She's not the only
beauty at this place.
See that woman over
there? That's Kristina Baumgarten.
Oh, great.
Now they recognize you.
It's all right.
All they can do
is ask for my autograph.
Everything all right?
Calm down.
Don't drink so--
Now you're getting drunk.
- What?
James, please. Just sit down.
- Don't tell me--
For God's sake,
this is ridiculous.
You're scum.
What did you say?
Repeat it!
You're scum. Again?
We are heroes!
No! James!
Ah! You imbecile!
It's sublime.
I was at a gala
performance in Lausanne,
back in 1918.
What memories.
Oh.
The neighbors, protesting
about the noise.
Renzo,
lower the volume.
I'll try and
calm them down.
Rome has become
a real bore.
At 10:00, they
want us all in bed.
Ah, you should try Paris.
Now, there they really
know how to enjoy themselves.
Ah, Paris. Yes.
It would be a pity if we
have to destroy the place.
You have to do something, Davide.
I don't know where
they've taken him.
Ah, Mr. Arthur Kunz?
This is our very own
Kristina Baumgarten.
An honor, madam.
- Nice to meet you.
All right, something
terrible's happened.
They've arrested James.
Arrested? What do you mean?
Two policemen came
and took him to prison.
All right.
Sit down, Kristina.
Sit down.
Try and relax.
Please. Now tell us
exactly what happened.
Surely it's
a misunderstanding.
No. No. There was
an argument,
and James hit a man
who was staring at me.
I tried to stop him,
but it was impossible.
Where were you, exactly?
In a restaurant,
in Trastevere.
In Via del Matonato.
But James is an actor.
We don't arrest actors
for causing a disturbance
in a restaurant.
It's the done thing.
Luckily, I think
I know the restaurant.
The owner is
a friend of mine.
Where is the phone?
In the hall.
Oh, thank you so much.
I need a cigarette.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Everything
will be all right.
Yes, yes. I understand.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
So I wouldn't mind a glass
of water or something.
Well, just, there were
these three men.
These very big soldiers.
They were drunk.
Well?
I'm afraid
it's a little more
complicated
than I thought.
Your Mister James
knocked down
a decorated war hero
of the Abyssinian campaign.
But James is a hero, too!
Oh, maybe, maybe.
You only escaped arrest
because you are
famous German star.
James is only
an English actor,
so he wasn't so lucky.
I need him on
the set tomorrow!
He'll have to stay
in jail overnight.
But I should have him
out by morning.
Let's go.
Oh, James!
James!
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry--
- You look terrible.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
What did they do to you?
- No, no. Come on--
These German women.
They look
as cold as ice,
and then you
find out different.
I'm just glad
we got him out.
It could have cost me
a day's shooting.
So sweet.
That's so-- thank you.
Coffee?
Here, James. Let me.
Are you all right?
Augh-- I--
You know--
I think you may be
right about Maria.
I, uh--
really must thank
both of you
for getting me
out of that place.
Thank you.
It's what
producers do.
Promise not to
let it happen again.
Unless provoked.
If you are, try not
to do it to a war hero.
There haven't got
many out there.
Come on, James.
Drink your coffee.
It's brilliantly
done, Molnár.
A superb piece
of moviemaking.
Thank you.
But there's
too much violence.
Oh, this is only
a rough cut.
And execution is violent.
Without the execution,
the story is meaningless.
Maybe.
But I'm against it.
I don't want to see an
execution on the screen.
Executions are an everyday
occurrence these days.
Maybe that's
why I'm against it.
I think you artists
can do a lot
as messengers of peace.
But this is
an anti-war film.
My  is
a hymn for freedom.
It's against violence,
oppression, dictator--
Are you mad?
I personally guaranteed
this film to the Ministry!
Take back what
you said immediately,
or I will
have you deported!
Oh, please, please, please.
There's no need to
get over-excited.
I'm sure Molnár can cut the
film to everybody's satisfaction.
Yes. I mean, it can
always be seen as
the heroic struggle
of Scarpia
to root out anarchy
and subversion.
And in doing so,
it costs him his life.
Ship is taking water
from all sides, matey.
It's time we left for England.
My friends.
Davide.
Why don't you get out?
Hitler wants a war,
and he will have it.
Danzig's doomed.
France and Britain.
Meanwhile, I have to find
a guarantee for the bank.
I'm willing to offer my
collection of paintings
as collateral.
Is it that bad?
Tell him, Gargano.
Unless we get
money from the bank,
I'll have difficulty
meeting the payroll.
I can't let
these people down.
They work. They slave.
They put their talent
and their guts into this film.
The least they deserve
is to be paid.
I'll talk with my board.
Good work, Molnár.
"Confident I can
count on your support
"in these troubled times.
"Yours, Davide Rieti."
Lord, he's fighting
for his life, poor bugger.
I'm surprised you
didn't get a letter.
Maybe I get
special treatment.
Remember, I'm a star.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
But if they don't pay you,
you're in the same boat
as the rest of us.
I think he'll pay.
I think Davide
is an honest man.
I'm sorry,
look me in the eye.
Now, tell me Davide Rieti
is an honest man.
Remember, he's a producer.
I'm looking.
Mm-hmm.
Davide Rieti is an honest man.
I believe you.
Why do you believe me,
James?
Because you're honest.
So let's give him
the time he needs
to finish the film, hmm?
I'm glad.
If we don't get it today,
we don't get it at all.
Daisy, where is everybody?
Mr. Molnár,
Kristina has a question.
Oh, yes.
Well, this is just
an intimate scene
between you
and Cavaradossi.
So I-- I cleared the set.
Why?
this is
an intimate love scene.
I want the audience to see
what your Cavaradossi sees.
Ohh. Like what?
You naked in bed
with Liguori.
Ah.
Naked?
Not completely naked, just...
your top half.
And you really think
this will help the picture?
Yes.
You know, Daisy,
the funny thing is
they don't seem to know
that before being in movies,
I worked in
a cabaret in Berlin.
Thank you.
Are you married, Daisy?
I was, to an Italian.
- Ah.
But, um,
it didn't work out.
Oh.
Do you have
any children?
Two.
They're safe in England
with my mother.
Have you ever noticed
that men can fight
the bloodiest wars,
but at the first sight
of a dirty nappy,
they scarper.
Yes, I have noticed that.
So how long have you
known Mr. Clavel?
Jamie? Oh, for years.
We've made
three movies together.
He's a good man, despite--
no, because of his vices.
He pretends that he--
that he doesn't care, but...
it's not true.
Okay?
Fine, thank you.
Right. We're ready.
Good.
Good?
Yeah.
Alfonso.
Alfonso.
Alfonso, you are on!
I'm here.
What is the panic?
Get out of there.
Aie! Aie.
What do you want?
I want this to be
the hottest thing
since Greta Garbo
and John Gilbert.
You don't want me
to fall in love
with him, do you?
Um, no offense, Alfonso.
No, of course not.
Just act.
I know it's hard,
but try.
So how much do you
want me to show?
I leave it to you,
Kristina.
Well, is this enough?
We've been friends
for years, Davide.
I'd be taking advantage.
No, I should refuse.
I don't want to,
but I have no choice.
I'll sell everything
except the the Morandi.
The market is very low.
When people are afraid,
they invest
in gold and jewels.
I only have
great paintings.
Yes, they are great.
You always bought the best.
I have to finish this film
before war breaks out
and they put a stop
to the whole thing.
I'm gambling I can
pull off one last film
before the floodgates open.
Why are you still here?
You have relatives abroad.
You would be safe with them,
and you could keep
your paintings.
I've got to sell.
I've never understood
your passion
for films, Davide.
It's a beauty.
It's one of
Scippione's best.
How much will you
give me for it?
No, you will not believe it,
it's so ridiculous.
I'm ashamed to tell you.
I'm sorry, old friend.
That's the maximum.
I'll take it.
Miss Baumgarten,
Signor Clavel,
Thanks.
Thank you, James.
To--
- Our guest of honor,
the great
Kristina Baumgarten.
The girl I knew when
she was in her teens,
and who stole
my best friend from me.
Hey, you knew Siegfried.
He was my best friend.
I received a letter
from him this morning.
He insists I stay
and finish the film.
Of course. To Siegfried,
duty before anything else.
Oh, uh,
isn't that the tune
from your last film?
Yes, it is.
You were marvelous.
Well, Sirk is
a great director.
He's fled to America.
- Why?
His wife is Jewish.
I'd like to dance, James.
James.
What?
Oh. Oh, yes.
Of course.
See you later, old chap.
Our first great reception.
Don't you think?
Mmm.
Kristina should be happy.
Mmm, she is magnificent.
I'm behind in her pay,
and she told me
not to worry.
Excuse me, I have
to interrupt you.
But the Princess wishes
to have a word
with you, Kristina.
Princess?
Hell.
Allow me to present
Kristina Baumgarten.
The Princess Domitilla
Giulia Altieri.
Uh--
You're beautiful.
No wonder my grandson
has lost his head over you.
Come with me.
I want to talk to you.
I must be honest
with you, sir.
I don't like actors,
especially English ones.
I could say
I don't like Germans,
but I'd be lying.
I mean, there's, what,
Beethoven, Bach,
Goethe,
Thomas Mann-- Waiter.
No, it's, uh,
just the Nazis
I don't like.
We wanted to meet you
to apologize in person
for my grandson's behavior.
He hasn't bothered me
for weeks now.
Because after the display
in your hotel bedroom,
we had him hospitalized.
Marcantonio's ancestors
were princes, statesmen,
great soldiers.
It's not easy for him
to live up to their level.
He's too honorable
to join in
the current rat race.
You don't understand
a thing about me, Grandmother.
My grandmother
is wrong about me.
I have no wish to live up to
the history of my ancestors,
warmongering thieves
and high-class whores.
I fell in love with you
because of your core beauty.
I saw something else in it,
a warmth and vulnerability
only I could see.
I knew we were soulmates.
Come, Marcantonio.
Come.
I've lost touch
with humanity, Kristina.
Are there no more hopes
or high dreams of visions.
I can no longer
see through walls.
The moon and the stars
aren't enough.
We're going home,
Marcantonio.
He can't help it.
Diseases of the spirit
can be worse
than physical ones.
I wouldn't have thought
you'd know
about those things.
And stay away from him.
Yes, I will.
I mean,
the English actor.
Ohh.
He's in danger.
Everyone on the film is.
I thought
the German government
wanted me to do this film.
Yes, it did.
But things change.
We will be at war
with England
within weeks.
My advice is
everybody leaves.
Kristina,
you will be considered
guilty by association.
The film is not finished.
Thank you.
#
Let's get out of here.
I'm tired.
"Eternal sorrow for
the death of our love."
"So I welcome death."
"Because the pain of living
is too much to bear."
Don't come in.
Oh, my God.
Go to my room.
Wait for me there.
I'll-- I'll deal with it.
They took him away.
If you want--
James, please, just hold me.
Here.
you look beautiful.
Espresso, please.
Two.
Do you have your passport?
Did you get your visa?
Yes, sir.
It's not a joke.
I found out your name is
already on the next list
for precautionary arrest.
Precautionary arrest?
What's that?
We're about to go to war.
You're not trusted.
If you're lucky,
they'll boot you out.
Why me?
Why?
contained
one known Bolshevik.
You haven't forgotten
Marchesini.
And if that is not enough,
you have an Englishman
in a starring role,
a Hungarian director--
The Hungarians
are our friends.
Yes. But are you sure
Molnár doesn't have
some Jews in his family?
We only have a few more days
of principal photography.
Just a few more days,
then the film is finished.
No. You will be finished
if you don't get out now.
Don't you understand?
If you stick around,
you will end up in jail,
or worse.
It's as bad as can be.
So you will leave tomorrow
morning at 9:12 for Milan.
I reserved a place for you,
first-class.
You will arrive at 5:25
at Central Station.
At 7:10, you'll get
the connection for Chiasso.
When you arrive in Lugano,
call your friend Kunz.
That's it.
Why are you
doing this for me?
We are friends.
We've been friends
for years.
I'll look after
your house in Villa Remolo
while you're gone.
Everything has got
to be legal, you know?
I wouldn't want people
to think I was
protecting a Jew.
Sign it.
Of course not.
Being your friend
doesn't come cheap.
László.
László, you have to
finish filming tonight
and be wrapped
by the morning.
Impossible.
- László, please.
Do your best.
I have to catch a train
first thing in the morning.
It's my last chance,
it seems.
That bad?
It's worse.
There's no more money.
Davide, I will do my best.
I hate to say this
about any producer,
but
I've grown fond of you.
I don't want anything
to happen to you
because of me.
And you, what will
you do after this?
Go to America.
War or no war, I want
to start making movies
with plenty of money
and no taste.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Boys and girls.
We are going to shoot
the last three days
of the schedule
before sunrise tomorrow.
I am asking you
to do this for Davide,
who has given everything,
everything but his shirt
for our film.
So let's make a start.
Chop-chop.
Cavaradossi.
take 1.
Action.
Help!
No! No!
Aah!
Get off!
Oh!
My love.
Cut! Cut!
Darling, darling.
You are wonderful.
Wonderful.
Darling, wonderful.
Darling, you were wonderful.
You were also good.
One more. One more.
Place!
Quick, stunt man, quick!
Action.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Action.
Look at the moon
and the stars.
The moon
and the stars there.
Cut.
Look at his hands.
They are too clean.
More dirt.
Please, makeup, please.
More dirt on his hands.
We must live as if it
were forever and ever.
Even if this is
our last night on Earth,
we must act as if
it is our first,
and be thankful.
The sun will rise,
and the world will be bathed
in its morning light.
We have to believe that.
Cut.
Print.
Lights!
All right, it's a wrap.
I'd like to thank everyone
for their magnificent work
through the whole
of this production,
particularly,
the last few days.
Now it's over, I can say
that I didn't think
we could pull it off,
but we have.
We've got something
we can be proud of.
Oh, László, László.
Let's celebrate.
Hear, hear!
Daisy.
Jamie,
Are you leaving
for London tomorrow?
Yeah.
I'm going by Luce
and picking up
transport there.
Would you mind if I tagged along?
- No.
There are no plane
or train reservations left
till Thursday.
And I've got a gut feeling
that, you know,
the sooner we Brits
clear out, the better.
Well, welcome aboard,
Daisy.
You did a marvelous job
on this film, László.
Thanks. That means
a lot to me.
You know, I'm catching
a train to Switzerland
first thing in the morning.
You left it bloody late,
Davide. You know that?
Yes, I know, I know.
But I wanted to see the end of the film.
- I know.
People like us have celluloid
for blood and brains.
We risk our lives
for just one more shot.
Well done.
So it's all over.
Yes.
Uh, frankly, I'm amazed
they got this far.
Well, it was worth it.
I hope so.
God, look at
all these people.
So close for months,
never
see each other again.
Don't leave me alone
tonight, James.
No.
It's too late
for us, Kristina.
We'll be far away
tomorrow.
I don't care
what happens tomorrow.
Who's there?
Davide, where have you been?
What are you doing?
I'm just taking
a last look around.
Who knows when I'll be
inside
a film studio again.
It's all make-believe.
Maybe that's why I love it.
The outside world
is so rotten.
In here,
it's so much better.
Davide, you have
an early start--
No. This is where I'm going
to spend my last night.
I will stay with you,
if you like.
They showed  here.
Henry Wilcoxon
and Ramon Novarro.
He was a homosexual too, no?
Was he? Good for him.
You know, this studio
did all the big epics.
The wonder of the movies
is in here.
Look up here,
in the flies.
The moon and the stars.
Orion,
Saturn, Venus.
All in their proper places.
Just waiting for the lights
to be turned on.
It's started.
Perhaps I should--
Morning, sir.
Um,
the matter of Maria Grazia
has been taken care of.
Good.
Is that all, sir?
Yes. Come back
in five minutes.
I have one more loose end.
The city's getting ready.
It's going to be a day
of parades and rallies.
Il Duce will be
making a speech.
I'm glad we'll miss it.
Mmm.
We're not
leaving the city.
The city's leaving us,
forcing us out.
I'll miss Rome.
I'll miss you, James.
I think I'm going to cry.
Uh, you don't have to.
I think the scene will
play better if you don't cry.
The audience will know
you want to cry.
I will know you want to cry.
Therefore,
you don't have to cry.
Oh, you damn English.
Everything is a joke with you.
How does anyone know
what you really feel?
I think you know me
well enough by now.
So-- So what will you do
when you get back?
Um, well,
I'm too old to fight,
thank God.
They'll find something
for me to do.
Are you sure you want
to go back to Germany?
I don't want to,
but I must.
Why?
My son.
- Oh.
I've neglected him
far too much already.
I understand.
I wish I didn't,
but, uh, I do.
No, you should get him
somewhere safe,
you know, to protect him.
Switzerland, maybe.
Oh, God.
Listen to me, giving advice.
You'll know what to do.
Well, I hope so.
It's time to be moving.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can you put that one
in last, please?
Yes.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
- Thank you.
Aah!
I put your dinner jacket
in your suitcase.
I don't know where
I'll use it, but thanks.
What freight are you?
Carriage number 5.
I prefer the front.
I've never been
to Switzerland or Milan.
Renzo, I'm sorry I can't
bring you with me,
but it's too dangerous.
I don't know
where I'll end up.
I know.
Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.
I'm sorry i-if I--
Davide...
He's my son.
Oh, yes.
You must be proud.
He is very handsome.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
Are you Davide Rieti?
Yes.
You're wanted
for questioning.
Please come with us.
What is all this about?
We have orders
to take you in.
