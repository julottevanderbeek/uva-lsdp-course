Where you been, lad?
Bus goes in 15 minutes.
The farm.
I had to get this back.
I-I'll want something to read.
Anyway, I'm, uh --
I'm all ready upstairs.
Your mother's up there.
What's the book?
- Oh,
- You'll be lucky if you have time for reading.
I never did.
- Bye, Mum.
- Good luck, Son.
Let's go.
Move away from it, son.
Get back. Get back.
There's somebody up there.
- Here we go.
- Get these hoses back! Get back! Get back!
Sorry, lad. You just missed it.
Go and get some sleep.
I'll finish here.
Seeing now,
dearly beloved brethren...
that this child is born again...
and received into the family
of Christ's church...
let us give thanks unto Almighty God
for these benefits...
Are you for the camp?
Hey, you!
- Are you for the camp?
- Yeah.
You're a bit late, son.
The others got in last night.
I know.
Got caught up in that air raid, eh?
- Yes.
You'll have to walk.
It's not many miles.
- Thomas Beddows.
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
Who are you?
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
- Do I look like an officer?
- No, sir.
Don't call me "sir" then.
- Who gave you permission to fall in?
- To what?
- To enter.
To come in the room.
To open the door and make an entrance.
- No one.
- Get it right then.
Go back outside, knock.
And when I say "yes,"
come in and say, "Permission to fall in."
Go on.
Beddows.
Your case -- take it.
Yes?
- Who are you?
- Beddows. Permission to fall in.
Come in, Private Beddows.
- You can have that one.
Leave that.
You're late already.
Haircut's next.
You'll find the barbershop
next to the company office.
- Next!
Stand still. Next.
Next. Name?
- Beddows, sir.
- Skinny, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
- Got a cough?
- No, sir.
- Okay. Clothes on over there.
- Next.
- Are you gonna stick that i-in me?
- Arm, please.
Feeling better, are you?
I don't like needles.
Is that all?
I don't like the whole sodding army.
Malcolm, Partridge, Silver, Young.
Right. Let's have a look at you.
Can you tell me what you've got there?
One pair of shorts, P.T.
One pair of drawers, cellular.
One balaclava.
One pair of braces. One pair of boots.
Great coat, socks, vests, gaiters.
Webbing,
packs large and small.
Battle dress, gas mask.
Anything else?
I don't think so.
What's this?
It's a pull-through.
You're learning.
Okay, all of you!
You're gonna keep this lot so clean
it dazzles me, and you're gonna start now!
Let's get two things straight
right away!
The first thing:
the word of command, "Stand easy."
You will not move at all...
until that word of command
is given to you!
You will not fidget,
move about or anything else!
- Is that understood?
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Corporal!
Up! Wash! Shave! Get dressed!
Clean this barracks room,
and I want it shining!
- One!
- Two!
- Three!
- Four!
- Five!
- Six!
- Seven!
- Eight!
- Nine!
- Ten!
- Eleven!
- Twelve!
The odd numbers, one pace forward!
Even numbers, one pace to the rear!
- March!
- One, two!
- Young, how many V.C.'s in the regiment?
- Four V.C.'s.
- Beddows, name of the regimental sergeant major.
- Regimental Sergeant Major Palmer.
- Right! Any questions?
- The regiment formed in 1685.
- Yes.
- What for?
I mean, was there any special reason?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
To impress the French!
Right. Let's have a look at what
you been doing. Stand by your beds!
Right! Now, let's start
all over again, shall we?
- Count!
- One, two, three! One!
Still! Perfectly still!
Form three ranks! Quick.
March! Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Rear. And fill over.
Right!
- One, two --
Get a hold of it now! Come along!
Eyes... front!
- Yes, sir.
I seem to have neglected to blanco
the belt underneath the buckle, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Left, one, two!
What are you bloody doing, Beddows?
Move back hard now!
-
- Whoa!
-
Fuck. I need a fag.
They're ahead.
Well, you go on.
I'm stopping for a smoke.
- I hate this war.
- You'll get through.
No, it's not that.
It's me girl.
We was engaged, see, and --
and then when orders come along,
well...
her old man
wouldn't let me marry her.
Said we could wait
till after we won the war.
Bastard.
He'd let the Jerries poke his wife
if they as much as knocked on the door.
I wanted to fly.
Failed the medical.
Didn't know that.
- Who you got waiting for you, Tommy?
- Who have I got?
Well, there's Mum and Dad, I suppose.
And Tina.
Good for you, mate.
Let me guess.
She got brown hair, brown eyes...
pale skin, nice tits, right?
Tina is a cocker spaniel.
- She's a lovely dog.
- A bitch?
Yeah. A bitch.
What are you gonna do
when all this is over?
Oh, I don't know.
I've got me plans.
Garage, mate.
I'm gonna buy a garage somewhere round here
and set up a scrap metal business on the side.
- Hey. We ought to go.
Coming with me and the lads tomorrow?
We're celebrating -- end of training.
Pub crawl in the afternoon,
fleapit in the evening.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
What's the film?
Forget the picture, mate.
It's the women.
You get next to a nice piece in the back stalls,
you'll be away before the titles come up.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
No bleeding NAAFI for us tonight.
- What, down there?
Yeah.
Hey! Don't do it.
You'll kill yourself.
- M.O. said he didn't need treatment, sir.
Prisoner and escort, quick march!
Left, right! Left, right!
Prisoner and escort, halt!
Private Beddows, fall in!
- Comfy, was it?
Only for "victory," Corporal.
- All by ourselves, are we?
You're a solitary sort
of geezer, aren't you?
I felt like reading.
Christ, I wish
this fucking war was over.
You spill your blood and guts
to help the Belgians...
and then four years later, you get ready to
spill 'em again to help the fucking French.
And in between,
you go paddling down on the south coast
learning how to keep your bloody rifle dry.
It's a fucking mix-up, if you ask me.
seen active service, and now they want to
send me back to bleeding battle school.
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.
It means we'll be the first ashore when they
do put on the sodding invasion, that's what.
Mmm.
- I suppose someone's got to go first.
- It's no fucking joke!
- Hi!
- We want to see you again, baby.
- Oh-ho! And you, soldier.
- Blow us a kiss, sweetheart.
- Good luck. Have a good time. Bye.
- I love your hat.
- How you doing? Let's have a quickie.
- Cheeky!
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Bye!
Hold those rifles high
and keep moving.
- This is a bloody nightmare.
- I feel sick.
Watch out. We're going in.
Ah! Aha.
Right then, Tom. This is it.
Lots of lovely crumpet
just waiting for it.
- Are you ready?
- Have you got any cigarettes?
Freeman's again. Here. Take 'em.
- Right. Fit?
- I-I'll follow you.
Okay.
- Good evening. Early tonight, lads?
- Got any wine, have you?
- Wine?
- Two pints of brown ale then, please.
- Vintage?
Look around, my boy.
What do you see?
- Half the regiment.
-  Yeah.
Ta.
Oh, we're not gonna be around
much longer.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You haven't got a drink.
- No.
- Can I -- Can I get you one?
- No, thank you.
- Have you been here long?
- What, sitting in this chair, you mean?
No. Here, generally.
About as long as most people,
I suppose.
Oh.
- And you?
- What?
- How long have you been here?
Just arrived really.
But, um, I don't think I'll stay long.
- What's dull?
- Dances, all this.
- I don't think dancing's dull.
- Oh?
- No.
Well, then let's --
Uh, will you have a dance
with me, please?
- I don't mind if I do.
- Come on then.
- How you doing, Arthur?
- All right.
- Watch out.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not very good on my feet.
- Shall we stop then?
No. Let's go on, please.
??
- ??
- Was that any better?
You're not as bad as all that.
Shall we go outside for a bit?
What for?
The rain's stopped.
All right.
- Is this your coat?
- Yes.
Have you seen any action?
Not really.
What do you mean, "Not really"?
Well, I've been on training.
That was tough.
- Really?
-  Yes.
- Do you like it?
- What?
Being a soldier.
Not much, no.
Then why are you?
- A soldier?
- Mmm.
I was called up, like everyone else.
- Is that all?
- No.
It's gotta be done.
We gotta finish it off
and pay out the ones who started it.
Yes.
I think you're very nice.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
I like you too.
I feel much better now.
I was quite...
nervous when I
f-first talked to you.
- It's funny.
- I know.
You thought the dance
was awfully dull.
I didn't, really.
- No?
- No.
C-Can I kiss you?
If you want.
I've got to go now.
I'm with my brother. He's in the band.
Oh.
Well, when can I see you again?
Whenever you'd like.
Not tomorrow.
- Monday?
- Yes. I'd like that.
Here, at 6:00.
All right.
Will you walk me back to the hall?
Anywhere you'd like.
Back to the hall.
I wish I'd met you before.
There's so little time now.
What do you say that for?
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
You'll be back...
and there'll be time.
Where are we going?
I've lost all sense of direction.
A game of musical bloody chairs, mate.
Thousands of us
moving around from camp to camp...
waiting for someone to shout,
"Second front! Last one over's a Charlie!"
First one over's a Charlie,
if you ask me.
You'd think they'd have a bit of sympathy for us
by now, wouldn't you? Send us by train.
A G.I. told me
where to find sympathy.
It's in the dictionary
between "shit" and "syphilis."
I thought you were meeting me tonight.
- I was called away.
To fight the war.
- Couldn't you have told me?
- There was no time.
So you left me.
- Are you coming back?
Don't know.
I don't know.
I do though.
Good-bye, Tom.
Please...
don't go.
If I get killed,
they've already got a photograph.
It's for our records,
Private Beddows.
Oh.
Follow the sign outside, please,
and get your anti-louse ware from the stores...
if you haven't already.
God. How much more?
There's a will form --
B-2089 -- to fill in.
- What for?
- What do you think?
Cannon fodder.
That's what we are.
Did you hear what Tom did
this morning?
No.
He went to see old Nickelby...
and asked him if they gave out compassionate leave
if there'd been a death in the family.
So Nickelby said, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
depending on the circumstances."
And Tom said, "Well, there hasn't
been a death in my family yet...
"but there's gonna be one very soon.
I request leave to go home
and console my parents."
What did Nickelby do?
He sent Tom with a note to the M.O.
Oh, Tommy. He's nuts.
He could do with a break.
Well, we could all do
with a break.
It's been nothing but film shows,
housey-housey...
and lemonade in the bleedin' NAAFI
when the beer runs out.
- Ah.
- Ah!
They're for me.
Shit.
Don't tell me it's your birthday.
Yeah. Couple of days ago.
The mail was held up.
- What's that?
-
- It's a key.
- That's a funny sort of birthday present.
- What's it for?
- What? It's a custom in our family.
You know, key to the door,
coming of age, that sort of thing.
- Yeah.
Happy birthday, kid.
- Plenty more of'em.
- Thanks.
How about this,Jack?
Oh, that's nice.
I think I'll go and get some ink
and write back to them.
- Can I have a look at your cards?
- Yeah, help yourself. See you later.
This Happy Breed
I've got nothing now.
I've thrown it all away.
I don't think
I'm gonna get through this.
You'll be all right.
We'll get you through.
- I'm not walking through this lot.
- So much for the seaside.
- ? And I don't care for him ?
? He can go and get another ?
? For I'm going to marry ?
? A far nicer boy ??
- Please, Mommy!
Sing it right through once more,
for the soldiers.
? Let him tarry ?
? Let him sink or let him swim ?
? He doesn't care for me ?
? And I don't care for him ?
? He can go and get another ?
? That I hope he will enjoy ?
Tommies, please don't go.
I think I'm gonna be sick again.
- Why didn't you become an officer,Jack?
They locked me
in a broken-down potting shed...
and told me to imagine
I was a prisoner trying to escape.
If I used that wall, I'd be shot.
If I climbed that fence, I'd be electrocuted.
If I trod here, there, anywhere,
I'd be blown up by hidden mines.
I didn't move a fucking inch.
If they hadn't come and let me out,
I'd still have been in that shed...
waitin' to become an officer.
- This is it.
We're going in.
Well, Beddows,
how many V.C.'s in the regiment?
Five V.C.'s.
Name of the commanding officer.
Lieutenant Colonel Hutchinson.
When was the regiment formed?
- 1685.
-Jesus Christ.
Names of all the birds Arthur's had
since he joined the army.
- Belinda.
- Yeah.
- Mabel.
- Yup.
- Alice?
- Ah, she were mine first.
-Janey.
- Who's that?
Shall I show you
how we prepare the dead?
- Easy. You'll be all right.
- Oh, God, he's dead.
Oh, fuck.
