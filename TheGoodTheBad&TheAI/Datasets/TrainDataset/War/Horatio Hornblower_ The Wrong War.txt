Man:
Captain Pellew.
Come in, Sir.
My apologies
for requiring you
at such short notice.
Not at all, my lord.
Captain Pellew,
may I introduce
General the Baron
de Charette
commander in chief of
His Majesty King Louis'
army in exile.
The general is going
to invade France...
and we're going
to help him.
Once your ships
have carried us
across the channel
We shall raise
an army of the people
and march on Paris
to restore His most
Catholic Majesty
to the throne.
May I ask, Sir
how many men you
expect to raise
for this... army?
Within a matter of days
I shall have, uh, 10,000,
maybe 20,000 men in arms.
Then we shall move east
gathering more as we go.
Never doubt the loyatty
of the people, monsieur.
I understand, sir, that in fact
arms have been raised against
the rebel government before.
Certainly, many times.
Without any success.
Captain Pellew
for five years
I have lived in exile
:
While traitors have
laid waste to my country.
Well, now the nobility
of France is going home
and this time,
when my countrymen fight
we, their rightful leaders,
will lead them into battle.
Can I not take it, sir
that we have your support
in this great venture?
Hood:
Oh, yes, Baron
you can depend on Captain
Pellew's full support.
You have His Britannic
Majesty's word on it.
How do I look?
The most startling
improvement, if I
may say so, sir.
So with two shirts, hat,
breeches, buttons and buckles
the sum is £11
nine shillings
and threepence.
Ah.
Perhaps pinchbeck
instead of silver
for the shoe buckles?
That would make it,
um...
shall we say £11 even?
Very well, Mr. Collins.
Hood:
I assure you, the baron
is still a figurehead
amongst those
loyal to King Louis.
His name will
provide the spark
sets all northern
France afire.
But the royalist
force, my lord?
They're nothing more
than the remnants
of a defeated army.
A final cast
of the dice,
I grant you.
Indeed, sir,
and a desperate one.
Ah, you forget
what is at stake,
Sir Edward.
For the cost
of ferrying
General Charette
and his men
across the channel
we can put an end to
the war with France.
Surely, even in
your estimation
it's a trifling effort
for a place in history.
Yes, but if
the expedition
should fail, sir
what of the cost in lives?
Men die every day
this war continues.
When it's over
we may count costs
at our leisure.
Make way.
Make way.
My lord, my lord.
Speak up, man!
The orders!
Well?
Gone, my lord.
Pox on them.
My lord?
He was carrying a copy
of General Charette's plan
to the first lord.
Oh, my God.
What if they fall
into enemy hands?
Well, we do not
know that.
They may be at
the bottom of the Thames.
The thieves drunk
in a tavern.
Sir, what if they're not?
His Majesty's government
has decided
and they are not in the business
of changing their minds.
Should General Charette
know of this?
I don't believe there's
any need to trouble him.
What has passed here
will remain between ourselves.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
However, since it
would not be politic
for King Louis to think
that we might have cast
his general ashore unaided
you will remain
on station
after the general
has disembarked.
And if worse comes to worst
you can provide him
with a means of escape.
As you wish, sir.
Very well.
You have your orders,
Captain Pellew.
Carry on, sir.
Mr. Hornblower.
Sir.
Well, don't stand
there dawdling, sir.
We must return to Plymouth
as soon as possible.
Man:
Go on.
Lay down your oars.
Welcome aboard, sir.
A profitable meeting
at the admiratty,
I trust?
Quite satisfactory,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Signal the ships
and request the attendance
of their captains in one hour.
Mr. Hornblower, my compliments
to the senior officers.
I will see them
in my cabin in 20 minutes.
Aye, sir.
So, Mr. Hornblower,
what news?
I know no more than you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Well, I expect
we shall find out.
By the way, I think
you have a splash
of mud on your jacket.
Ah, ha-ha.
You look every inch
the new lieutenant,
Mr. Hornblower.
Long may it remain so.
Gentlemen,
captain's compliments
and he will see all officers
in his cabin in 20 minutes.
Kennedy:
What? Who's this?
Gentlemen,
it appears
we have a stranger
in our midst.
No, no...
I'm mistaken.
It's Lieutenant
Hornblower
from top to toe
a new man.
And not a patch in sight.
Indeed it is,
acting Lieutenant Kennedy.
Gentlemen, it appears
that Mr. Hornblower
is now the standard
by which we must all
measure ourselves.
All right, all right,
that's enough.
Thank you, Mr. Bowles.
Styles:
Oi! Watch it.
What do you reckon
the orders will be,
then, eh?
Stay here
and take it easy.
Not unless
the captain's gone soft.
Naw. Pity, though.
I could just do
with another month
on fresh rations.
Maybe we'll be sent
to the Indies, eh?
How about that?
Palm trees, sunshine.
Tropical diseases.
Could be the Med again.
Have another go at them dagos.
Yeah, we
could go back
and give them
another pasting, easy.
Do it on our own,
too.
Leave the rest
of the fleet
in the channel.
Oi, fanny fearless,
missed a bit.
Where?
Behind you.
Where?
Gentlemen,
as you are no doubt aware
I have lately returned from
a meeting with Admiral Hood.
Our orders are
to join the ships
and convey
a General Charette
together with forces
comprising of French
royalist troops
and British infantry
to the coast of France.
An invasion, sir?
Mr. Kennedy, four ships
could hardly constitute
an invasion, sir.
Then what is the point, sir?
The point, Mr. Bowles
is that we are at war, sir.
And when at war, we react
to an order without hesitation.
Um... I understand, gentlemen
this plan may seem
somewhat... cavalier.
However, it is
the general's plan,
once landed
to raise an army
with which to march on Paris
and place King Louis
on the throne.
That would mean an end
to the war, sir.
I believe that is
the intention, Mr. Bracegirdle.
Sir, are we permitted
to know
where the general's troops
will be landing?
No, our destination
will remain secret
until we set sail,
and then there is no chance
of word reaching the French
until we arrive.
In the meantime,
I want all dispatch
in the loading
of the general's men
and supplies as soon
as they arrive.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Perhaps next week we could
be toasting the downfall
of the French
Republic, sir.
Yes, Mr. Hornblower.
That is the plan, at least.
Styles, let's get those bales
loaded as soon as possible.
Frogs?
What the bloody hell
are they doing here?
Well, what do you
make of them, Horatio?
They seem a little...
Hornblower:
Disorderly.
The word "shambles"
might be more appropriate.
Look out
for the lobsters.
Officer:
Battalions, hatt!
Morning, gentlemen.
Major Edrington, 95th foot.
I've been told someone here
can see to the embarkation
of my men
onto the
Lieutenant Hornblower.
Acting Lieutenant
Kennedy, sir.
I will see to it myself.
Excellent.
Your men look
very fine, Major.
Almost too good
for battle.
Really? I usually find
that the more able the officer
the better turned out the men.
Commanding officer:
Battalions...
At least in the army.
Commanding officer:
...right face!
French soldiers:
Charette! Charette!
Charette!
Charette! Charette! Charette!
Charette! Charette! Charette!
Charette! Charette!
Bloody frogs.
Have you any idea
what he's saying?
He's saying today
is a great day.
They are on a crusade
to free their
beloved France.
"Together we will fight,
perhaps to the death..."
"But it will be for the
greatest cause in the world."
"Every one of us..."
"will be remembered
by history as men
who were not afraid
to lay down their lives..."
"For France."
All:
Yay!
I suppose what
they lack in discipline
they make up for in enthusiasm.
Major...
if you would like
your personal baggage
transferred to the jolly boat
I'll see it reaches
the
Very well.
By the by, it might be better
if you were to address me
as "my lord."
I am, in fact,
the earl of Edrington.
You see, Horatio?
Had you been rich enough
to buy a commission
as well as a new uniform
you could've joined
the army instead.
Lieutenant Hornblower,
Please, monsieur, I have
I think English sufficient
to the task before us.
Colonel Marquis
de Moncoutant.
I have been charged
with conducting your
troops aboard, sir.
Very good.
My men are prepared.
I am looking forward
to our trip, monsieur.
I have always enjoyed
the sea air.
Be careful, that is
my personal baggage.
Marquis de Moncoutant:
Don't drop it!
It is yours, sir?
Indeed, Mr. Hornblower,
it is mine.
Man:
Shoulder arms!
All men and supplies
secured, sir.
Very good, Mr. Hornblower.
Signal the convoy.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Bowles, prepare
to weigh anchor.
Aye aye, sir.
Prepare to weigh anchor!
Man the capstan!
Quiberon.
Styles:
See this? Not yours!
Not yours!
No steal-ee, savvy.
You steal-ee, get chop
plenty damn
Styles:
Understand?
Oldroyd! What's going on here?
Ah, this bugger
was after pinching
this chicken, sir.
They're the officer's
chickens
and we caught
him red-handed.
Stealing is an
hanging offense, sir.
Yes, Matthews, I'm aware
of that, thank you.
Ha! Well, it's the rope
for you then, frog.
However, this man
may  be.
Has anyone taken
the trouble
of explaining messing
arrangement to these men?
Not as such, sir.
Let him go!
You're letting
him go, sir?
Styles, these people
are our guests
and as such,
you will extend to them
every courtesy and kindness
while they're aboard.
Well, I mean,
playing piggyback
with the frogs, sir.
The frog is the enemy, sir.
Not these frogs, Styles.
These are the good frogs.
A frog is a frog, sir.
And the only good frog
is a dead frog, sir.
This'll end badly,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.
You mark my words.
All right, that's enough!
Now about your work.
Aye aye, sir.
Styles.
Sir?
Put the chicken back, Styles.
But, sir...
Styles!
Yes, sir.
Come.
Hornblower:
Report from the
quarterdeck, sir.
Wind still
from the north,
course steady.
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.
Mr. Hornblower?
Sir?
A word, if you please.
How are the men taking to their
new traveling companions?
As one might expect, sir.
They have a few misgivings
about their presence
but nothing untoward.
Misgivings?
What kind of misgivings?
I think they have
a little difficutty
in seeing the general's
troops as allies
when only yesterday
any Frenchman was the enemy.
You have made it clear
they must give the general
their full support?
Oh, yes, sir, very clear.
Good, good.
And yourself?
What do you, um, think of the
general and, uh, his plan?
I think he is bold, sir.
Bold?
Is that all?
Without knowing either the
general or his plan in detail
I wouldn't presume
to judge, sir.
Oh, a prudent enough answer.
There is also some speculation
about our destination, sir.
What would you say
if I were to tell you
we were heading
for the coast of Brittany?
What would be
your guess then?
In that case, I would say
Quiberon Bay, sir.
Would you?
Why?
From my recollection, Quiberon
affords a good landing.
It is the logical choice.
Your deduction is correct.
Let us pray, Mr. Hornblower
that the French Republicans
don't share your logic.
Otherwise, Quiberon Bay
may not be
such a welcoming spot
after all.
We have to stop the artillery
of the republic here
from moving against us
through Muzillac
west to Quiberon, here.
le Colonel Moncoutant
he will lead
a group of men
to take control of the bridge
at Muzillac, here.
Le colonel is, uh,
Marquis du Muzillac.
He's, um, the, uh,
the lord of that village
so he knows the region
very well.
Oh, you must be glad
to be returning home
to Muzillac, Colonel.
No doubt the people
will welcome you.
Most of them will,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Some will be sorry to see me
but I shall be glad
of the encounter.
Um, Colonel Moncoutant
requires the company
of infantry
to secure or destroy
the bridge at Muzillac.
Major Edrington?
I believe my men
are up to the task, Captain.
Monsieur, I protest;
as Lord of Muzillac
the honor of defending the
bridge should fall to my men.
With respect, Colonel,
your men have not seen action
for several years, whereas...
Do you question the competence
of our French troops, Major?
Merely their lack
of recent experience.
So you do question them.
I will not allow it!
Gentlemen, surely we
are all allies here.
As long as our campaign
is successful
we will all share
the honors.
Charette:
Monsieur Hornblower is right.
To restore the king,
that is our only concern.
As you wish, Colonel.
May I suggest, Colonel,
that one of my officers
act as liaison
between yourself
and Lord Edrington.
You seem to have a grasp of
the situation, Mr. Hornblower.
Perhaps you'd like
to volunteer?
Yes, sir.
We'll be taking
two 12-pounders
and enough powder
to destroy a bridge.
Uh, what size is
the bridge, sir?
Well, I'd imagine
it's a bit bigger
than the river,
Matthews.
Sir?
Uh, never mind.
Um, take ten extra
powder casks to be sure.
Aye aye, sir.
Styles:
Begging your pardon,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.
Why can't the French
use their own cannon?
Styles.
It might have escaped
your notice, Styles
but General Charette's
troops don't have
any cannon.
Well, I don't mind letting
them take ours, sir.
Yesterday you were
prepared to hang a man
for taking a chicken
but today, you're willing
to give him our guns.
Very generous.
Decided the French
are all right after all
have you, Styles?
No.
Your men are reluctant
to go ashore with us?
On the contrary, sir,
they're all quite eager.
I am happy
to hear it.
With the help
of your men
I hope to see
my home restored
to something of
its former glory.
They will do everything
in their power, sir.
I think you are
a stranger to my country
Mr. Hornblower.
You cannot imagine
what these republicans
are capable of.
There is no place
they would not defile.
Nothing they would
not besmirch.
Let us hope
your fears are unfounded.
Hmm.
You do not know
these people.
They are barbarians.
But order will be restored,
monsieur, you may depend on it.
Captain, landing beach
in sight, sir.
Very good, Mr. Bowles.
All hands shorten sail.
Aye aye, sir.
All hands, shorten sail!
Mr. Hornblower,
the beach is in sight.
Prepare to disembark,
if you please.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Hornblower.
Sir?
You will be
on foreign soil
the enemy
all around.
Be on your guard,
take care.
And do not assume
a situation is safe
until you can convince
yourself that it is so.
I will keep it
in mind, sir.
Good.
I trust you will not abandon your
prudence of yesterday.
No, no, sir, I will not.
Carry on, Mr. Hornblower.
You are, uh, concerned
for his safety, Captain.
I am concerned for
the safety of all
my men, General.
But the, uh, lieutenant
in particular, huh?
He's one of my
best officers.
And despite his
lack of years, I...
I would regret
his loss.
Then let me
reassure you.
I am confident
that within a few days
the whole of France
will be behind us.
And then your young lieutenant
will be able
to tell his grandchildren
how he helped restore
the flag of King Louis
to its rightful place
to fly once more
over the sacred soil of France.
Others:
Man 1:
Company, fall in!
Fall in on the right!
Man 2:
Number two company,
over here!
Man:
Forward, right!
Archie, so,
how does it feel
to be back on this side
of the channel?
Better with a pistol
and cannon to hand.
We're going to need
some kind of transport
to get the guns
and powder to the bridge.
I'll see what Colonel
Moncoutant has in mind.
He worries more about that
machine than anything else.
At this rate, it will be the only
thing to reach Muzillac.
Are your men ready to move,
Mr. Hornblower?
Yes, my lord, save
for our cannon.
By god, if that's any of ours, I'll
have them flogged.
Those are the French
troops, I believe.
It would be.
What do they think
they're here for?
Gentlemen, you are ready
to advance?
men are ready, sir.
What are you saying?
Colonel, I believe
we still require
transport for our cannon.
That is already taken care of.
When you are ready,
we will proceed.
Muzillac awaits, gentlemen.
This stuff bloody stinks.
Least they could have done
was clear out.
Styles, let's have
less griping there.
Just be glad
you're not
carrying those cannons
all the way to the village.
From acting lieutenant
to commander of a dung cart
in no more than a step.
My career's looking up.
Mr. Hornblower
as you and I are
the senior
British officers
I think we should
advance together.
Come, sir.
Unless you prefer
the dung cart?
I see now why you
chose the navy.
All men and supplies
ashore, sir.
All boats returned.
Thank you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Signal all ships
to make sail.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Bowles!
Sir.
Set course for
Quiberon, please.
Aye aye, sir.
Pellew:
We shall head west
to land General Charette's
main force.
Course, Mr. Bowles?
West by north,
sir.
Be there by noon
with this wind, sir.
Could've been sent for us.
Perhaps.
When we get to Quiberon,
Mr. Bowles
I want you to heave to
as close in shore as possible.
Once unloading is complete, we
shall remain there on station.
Remain, sir? I thought...
The
and
will return home to England,
but we...
we stay.
Well, Mr. Hornblower,
there is our objective.
Do you think you can hold it?
We must... either hold it
or destroy it.
General Charette
is counting on us.
Well, in that case...
Major Edrington,
you will find a ford
half a league upstream
beyond the village.
You will station your men
there in due course.
I only hope we're up to it,
Colonel.
Mr. Kennedy, have the men
set up the cannon
to cover the southern approach.
We'll see about setting
the gunpowder
when I return from the village.
Aye aye, Mr. Hornblower.
You heard, Matthews.
Aye aye, sir.
Quiberon Bay, sir.
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Take us in shore
and heave to.
Aye aye, sir.
Now my people
will welcome me home.
Man:
Left, left, left, right, left...
Left, left,
left, right, left.
Captain...
a signal
from the
They are ready to begin
disembarking the troops.
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Make our own
preparations.
Aye aye, sir.
General, I would deem it a favor
if you would allow
one of my officers
to accompany you ashore
to send back regular reports.
Reports?
Yes.
Admiral Lord Hood
has ordered that we remain here
until your progress is assured.
But, why?
I believe the admiral wishes us
to remain here
as a place of retreat
in case you meet heavier
resistance than anticipated.
Very well, Sir Edward.
I thank you for your honesty.
But, uh, I can assure you
these reports,
they will carry only good news.
I pray so, sir.
:
I pray so.
Man:
Company, hatt.
Faure?
Pierre Faure?
He says he is the mayor.
You are the linen merchant.
Your business is underwear.
Not any longer, monsieur.
And by authority of...
Authority?
You have no authority.
I am the marquis.
Take off that ridiculous thing.
I regret, monsieur...
You regret?
I want the people brought
out here to welcome me home.
Gentlemen, if you please.
Man:
Left, left
Left, left, right, left.
Oh,
Arrest them!
You have no right
to arrest them.
They have done nothing.
No right?
By what right have you
destroyed my home?
Monsieur, this house
has been commandeered
for the use of the people.
Silence!
Where are the rest
of my paintings?
My... art collection?
Monsieur Marquis...
Where?
They had no practical use.
They were used as fuel
for the fires.
Burned?
Remove those flags.
No, monsieur,
I regret...
Remove them.
Allons enfants de la patrie,
le jour de gloire est arrive
:
Contre nous de la tryannie
L'etendard sanglant est leve
L'etendard sanglant
est leve
Entendez-vous
dans les compagnes...
Child:
Aux armes, citoyens...
Woman:
Shh!
Formez vos bataillons
Marchons, marchons...
Shh.
Qu'un sang impur
Abreuve nos sillons!
Give me your pistol.
Colonel.
Give me your pistol!
No, monsieur, please.
He's a child.
He doesn't understand.
Then I will make him
understand.
No, please, please!
Colonel, for God's sake.
The town is yours.
Why waste powder on a child?
He can do us no harm.
All is well.
French troops:
Mademoiselle,
take these children away.
Thank you, monsieur.
Uh... thank you.
I take it the welcoming
ceremony is now over.
You see,
Monsieur Bowles
the people, they are
happy to see us.
Aye, sir.
I had thought to meet more
resistance than this.
The Republicans, they have
no stomach to fight.
That's right...
bit more, Styles.
That's three barrels
placed, sir.
This'll be
the fourth.
I reckon that'll
be enough
to bring this down
when the time comes.
I think we'll put
two more barrels
over the side here,
just to be sure.
Matthews:
Begging your
pardon, sir
But, uh, if the enemy's
expected from that side
and when we blow
the bridge up
we're going to be
that side.
How do we get back
to the beach?
We don't.
We hold this position
at all costs.
Surrounded by frogs
and no escape.
Styles.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
There's more than bloody frogs
down here, sir.
Carry on then.
Yes, sir.
Archie.
Hmm? Yes?
I think
I'll go and see
how Major Edrington
is faring at the ford.
Will you take charge?
Yes, yes, of course.
Matthews is right,
though, Horatio.
If we have to blow up
the bridge
we will be cut off.
I know.
A fine thing, to die
in someone else's war.
Edrington:
S'arnt, send pickets
at front and flank
and across the river
to act as lookouts.
Man:
Very well, my lord.
My lord,
is everything well?
Well?
Look at this place,
Mr. Hornblower.
No artillery would
dare to cross here
and if they tried
my mama could
beat them off
with her parasol.
They may send
infantry as well.
They may.
But to be plain,
my greatest fear
is that the enemy will ignore this
place attogether
and concentrate on the bridge.
And if they
should cross...
You do not
trust my men.
I do not doubt your men
but I have no confidence
that the frogs
would stand firm
and support you.
I see, but
General Charette...
General Charette isn't here.
Our commanding officer
is Colonel Moncoutant.
And from his earlier exhibition
it is clear that whatever
his rank, he is no soldier.
Never underestimate the
enemy, Mr. Hornblower
but never overestimate an ally
particularly one who is
caught up in his own affairs.
Better go and
report to him.
See what he's up to.
I think this is a good place
to make camp, monsieur Bowles.
The men, they can rest
and tomorrow...
Tomorrow we
take Quiberon.
Oh, damn this animal.
What it needs
is a rudder.
Just show it
who's master,
Mr. Hornblower.
I don't need to, it knows.
I've heard it said
that the guillotine
is as effective
at subduing trouble
as an army
of 5,000 men.
I do not think it
would take 5,000 men
to subdue these people.
By the look of it,
a handful could do it.
Girl:
Woman:
Ah,
Just the men I need.
Gentlemen... I trust
I will have the pleasure
of your company
at dinner tonight.
At dinner?
We look forward
to it, Colonel.
Excellent,
shall we say 8:00?
Come, Mr. Hornblower.
Our men will be
expecting us.
There is nothing
we can do here.
Message from Mr. Bowles, sir.
Well?
General Charette
has made camp for the night.
Has he met
any resistance?
No, sir.
That's good, surely?
Yes, but why
is it so easy?
The Republicans could have put
out lines of defense anywhere.
Unless...
Unless what, sir?
Mr. Bracegirdle,
have you wondered why it is
we have been ordered
to remain here?
I had assumed it was to provide
a place of retreat
for General Charette
should circumstances
have turned against him.
Aye, but only one ship when it
took four to bring him here?
So if General Charette
is indeed forced to retreat...
it is not expected
he will return
with more than a quarter
of the men he set out with.
The mathematics of defeat,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Moncoutant:
You see, gentlemen,
a republic...
a country run by peasants
is a contradiction
of all the natural laws.
Observe, if you will
how my house has suffered
during my absence.
The peasants could not
look after it
because they have no breeding
and thus no intelligence.
Entrust them with fine furniture,
paintings
they see only firewood.
They probably used my best
brandy to ignite the blaze.
Forgive me, sir,
but I have always
held it true
that any man may better himself,
however humble his situation.
But to what purpose?
Monsieur, I remember
I once had a horse
which, uh, for amusement
I taught to count off
the days of the week.
Did this make him a scholar?
Naturally,
it remained a horse.
And so with the peasant.
Surely, Colonel
given a chance to learn...
You know, Monsieur Hornblower
I think you are a revolutionary
at heart yourself.
Indeed I am not, sir.
I began to suspect it in the
square this afternoon, actually.
I take offense at that, sir.
But I tease you, of course.
But, monsieur, my country
is the farce you see today
precisely because certain
good souls, like yourself
believe they can teach
the peasant to think.
Major Edrington, like myself,
you hold aristocratic title.
Surely you will support
me in this?
Colonel... you have
obviously given the matter
more thought than I.
However, you may be assured
that I thank God daily
for the good fortune of my birth
for I am certain I would have
made a miserable peasant.
Mariette,
Take this woman.
She is a peasant.
She works in my house
as her mother
did before her.
But in the days
of the republic
they made her
a teacher.
Was this simple creature
put on this earth
to teach grammar,
huh?
It's much better
to leave her free
to do what she
does best, huh?
Ah, she says she
is not an animal.
There is no need
to translate her words, sir.
I understood her French, as she
clearly understood your English.
Have a care, Mr. Hornblower.
So it is self-evident, sir,
she cannot be as ignorant
as you are so anxious
to make her.
Once again, monsieur,
I hear the rebel in you.
Then you mistake yourself
again, sir, for I am no rebel.
I hope I am a gentleman
and that I will always treat
any woman with respect.
Enough!
I will not argue
with a common sailor
in the British navy.
Before you slight a common
sailor, sir, may I remind you
that the British Navy
and its common sailors
have conveyed
your grace's person thus far
without incident
or injury.
Good night, gentlemen.
Now... where is our dessert?
Ma'amselle...
I beg your pardon.
So, we are no more
than the animals.
I assure you, ma'amselle,
it is not a view I share
nor would wish
to hear expressed.
You have been kind.
Once again,
you have tried to help me.
I did no more than
my conscience dictated.
But now, I am afraid there is
nothing more you can do for me.
Ma'amselle...
at least allow me
to escort you home.
There is no need
to trouble yourself.
I assure you
it is no trouble.
It would be
a pleasure.
Very well.
Thank you.
Today I think
there is only one lord
and master in France.
Ma'amselle?
That machine.
For Moncoutant
or the Republicans,
it is the same.
Does he think he will
make us love him this way?
I am afraid I am not privy
to the colonel's plans.
Then what are
you doing here?
I'm here to do
my duty.
And what is that,
your duty?
We will hold the bridge,
until we are told to leave.
Or until you are forced
to leave.
So, the children have
an unexpected holiday.
I'm sure once the colonel
is more settled...
For 20 years, I lived
like a dumb farm animal.
I have no desire to
live like that again.
Nor will you.
I will not
let it happen.
You have my word on it.
I accept your
kindness, monsieur,
but not your word.
You do not know what
you are talking about.
Ma'amselle,
whilst I am here
you will come
to no harm,
I swear it.
And when you are gone?
You do not know me,
ma'amselle.
If you knew me,
you would not be
so quick to doubt me.
It is not you I doubt.
It is this place.
I will protect you.
On your way.
Back to the bridge,
both of you.
I'm sorry, monsieur.
Officers first, naturally.
I do not think
they'll be back.
But at least allow me
to protect you
from them.
I would be glad if you did.
Begging your pardon,
sir.
Is everything
all right, sir?
Yes, fine.
Fine, thank you, Matthews.
What is it?
The bridge.
Stay here!
Reload!
Quick!
Fire!
Reload and come starboard
by a point!
But sir, we can't
see anything, sir.
Do as I tell you!
Starboard point!
Hold there!
Form up in ranks!
What's going on,
Mr. Hornblower?
I don't know, sir.
Fire!
Reload!
Archie,
Where are they?
What are you shooting at?
Hurry! Come on men, hurry!
Archie!
Mr. Kennedy, report!
Sir, enemy musket fire
across the river.
They, they took
us by surprise.
Came out of nowhere.
Keep your heads down!
Don't give them a target!
Ready, Styles!
Ready!
Ready!
Heave!
Gun ready!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!
Any attempt on the bridge?
No, sir.
Very well.
I suggest you re-form your men.
Yes.
Aye aye, sir.
Come on men,
stand to.
They made good time.
But where's their
artillery?
Why attack without it?
At first we thought it
might be thunder, sir.
No, Mr. Bracegirdle,
that is cannon.
What in God's name
is French artillery
doing this far west?
They should be
miles over there
to the south of Muzillac!
I fear the general's
campaign is over
before it has begun.
General, I have counted
at least 30 artillery pieces
ranged against us.
They have made a trap for us
and we have walked
straight into it.
Have we received word
from Mr. Bowles?
No, sir.
There have been
no further reports.
Then send a squad
of men ashore.
They are to reach General
Charette with all speed
and report back
on his situation.
Aye aye, sir.
If the cannon fire
has stopped...
I fear we must
assume the worst.
:
If you would just...
:
Send the men ashore,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Aye aye, sir.
Man:
Archie.
No sign of
their artillery?
Not yet.
I think I'll go to see
the major at the ford.
Horatio?
When they started shooting...
I panicked.
I knew I was doing it,
but I couldn't stop myself.
It was the suddenness
of it, you see.
I think it was the same
for all of us.
But an officer...
even an acting lieutenant,
has no business to panic.
Archie, you have nothing
to fear from the enemy.
They mean to kill us, Horatio.
Aye, of course they do.
But their powder's
no threat to us.
From this distance,
they'd be hard pressed
to hit a barn door.
If you can just stay calm
and keep yourself
out of their sights
they cannot possibly touch you.
All right.
General!
We are finished,
Mr. Bowles.
Not yet, sir.
Save yourself if you can.
This is not your country,
Mr. Bowles.
You should not
have to die here.
Careful, Mr. Hornblower.
We have a few wasps here
who are anxious to sting.
So I see, my lord.
Do you have any indication
of their number?
Hard to tell; they atter
their position constantly.
It is the same
at the bridge.
I have little time
for an enemy that
daren't show its face.
What can they hope to
gain by such a display?
Perhaps you should inform
Colonel Moncoutant.
By all means,
if you can distract him
from his concerns
at the village.
Your own concerns
there last night...
I trust they
were concluded
satisfactorily?
Why... yes,
thank you, my lord.
I will talk
to the colonel.
Mr. Hornblower?
If you should speak to him
I think a little more diplomacy
wouldn't go amiss.
Yes, my lord.
The shore party
have returned, sir.
Well, Mr. Bracegirdle?
They failed
to make contact
with general
Charette's camp.
It is as we suspected, then?
All men are believed
lost, sir.
I stand before you a man
accused, Mr. Bracegirdle.
Accused, sir?
By whom?
By my own self.
I knew.
I believed this campaign
was a forlorn hope
and yet I held my tongue.
For what reason, sir?
I was ordered
to remain silent.
Then the responsibility
does not lie with you, sir.
It is with those
who gave the order.
In principle, perhaps,
but what of...
conscience, Mr. Bracegirdle?
And what of my order
to remain here?
Must I also follow that?
For if I do, it is certain
more lives will be lost.
Now that the republican forces
have defeated Charette
surely they will turn
next to Muzillac.
Do I disobey my order...
or do I stay here
and wait for the dead
to return?
The mathematics of defeat.
Indeed.
A hateful equation...
and I do not have the answer.
Yes, I got him.
Up a bit.
There we go.
A bit more.
Let it go.
Stand back.
Gotcha!
Gotcha, you frog!
Belay firing!
Don't waste the powder.
Jean Fabier, you
have been found guitty
of sedition and treason
and have been
sentenced to death
by order
of the lord of Muzillac.
Woman:
Mr. Hornblower, should
you not be at the bridge?
Colonel, the enemy continues
to put out sporadic fire.
But there is no sign
of their artillery.
Afraid to show themselves.
Well, I would expect no more.
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.
Sir, may I suggest
that you accompany me
back to the bridge?
I have no doubt
we would all benefit
from your assessment
of the enemy.
Thank you for your invitation,
Mr. Hornblower
but as you can see, I am
rather preoccupied at present.
Sir, I must strongly advise that
you come to the bridge at once.
The enemy, sir...
Name?
What is this man's name?
Hornblower:
Sir, I cannot understand
why you persist
with these executions
when the enemy remains
at large and unaccounted for.
Enough, Mr. Hornblower.
As you see, I have
business here in town.
If you wish to scout
for the enemy
I will not prevent you.
But I remind you,
I am your commanding officer
and in my experience,
it is proper
to greet the absence
of an enemy
as good news.
Good day, monsieur.
Name?
Prepare to set sail,
Mr. Bracegirdle
before we lose the wind.
For Muzillac, sir?
Aye aye, sir.
What of Mr. Bowles, sir?
We must assume him lost
with the others.
All hands to make sail!
So you want a fight then, eh?
Is that what you want?
Keep your head
or you will lose it.
Is that understood?
Do you understand,
Oldroyd?
Good man.
As idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean.
Sir?
We have no wind,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
We are becalmed.
Call away the boats,
Mr. Bracegirdle.
Call away the boats.
S'arnt Major, form
a platoon of skirmishes
to cross the river.
It's time we smoked these
wasps out of their nest.
Yes, my lord.
Platoon hatt!
Right face!
Rear rank, present.
Rear rank, fire!
:
Artillery...
Number one!
Number two!
Number three!
How far have we come,
Mr. Bracegirdle?
Perhaps three
miles, sir.
We'll get to Muzillac
if I have to row there myself.
Platoon.
Attention!
How many, S'arnt Major?
Eighteen?
Is that all?
Then where in god's name
are the rest of them?
Man:
:
Mariette! It's me, Horatio.
Have you not seen...
have you not seen what is
happening in the square?
I needed to see you.
Just now they
killed the baker.
He is guitty of no more
than selling stale bread.
Surely you can see how
dangerous Moncoutant is.
He's still my
commanding officer.
As an officer,
you obey him.
But as a man, you
know what he is,
do you not?
Mariette, I have
to ask you something.
Before we came here
did you see any
enemy soldiers
passing through
the village?
Which enemy soldiers
did you have in mind?
The Royalists
or the Republicans?
Mariette, please.
No.
You come here
knowing nothing
about me or this place.
And you dare to ask me
to betray my own people.
Your silence could mean
more bloodshed, not less.
If you mean those butchers,
I am glad of it.
It was not them
I was thinking of.
If my men are
not prepared...
You yourself could die.
The Republicans came,
three days ago.
Now please go.
You cannot win here.
Take your men and leave now
while you still can.
Horatio.
I have lost too many people
without saying good-bye.
I will come back
and take you away
from here
if that's what you want.
Now go.
Bring forth the next man.
Moncoutant:
Name?
Moncoutant:
You have been found guitty
of sedition and treason
and have been sentenced
to death
by order
of the lord of Muzillac.
I knew we should have
went to the Indies.
I told you before:
Yellow fever, typhoid.
Much better off here, eh?
Sir.
Have a look at this.
Look out for the lobsters.
Oi, Oldroyd.
I think we have been made
fools of, Mr. Hornblower.
There is no army here,
just a handful of frogs
making idle sport.
I'm convinced the army
is massed to the north, my lord.
We're facing the wrong way.
Did you speak to the colonel
of this?
The colonel?
The village...
it's just butchery.
I see.
In that case, I suggest we look
to ourselves for command.
I think we have no choice,
my lord.
Pellew:
Come on, men!
Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Hey, hey!
Pull!
Pull! Pull!
There.
This expedition becomes
more ill-fated
by the moment, Mr. Hornblower.
Quickly now, bring those in.
I don't reckon they'll
be back in a hurry.
Better off
without them.
My lord, it seems
the emigres have
had enough.
They may lack discipline,
Mr. Kennedy
but those men
are no cowards.
They are going to defend
the village.
Will it hold,
my lord?
It might,
for a while.
Mr. Hornblower is there now,
organizing their defenses.
But as the commanding
officer here
I think there is little more
we can do for these people.
You wish to retreat?
I do, though it gives me
no pleasure to say it.
We will take up
a defensive position
across the river.
Ready your men
to blow the bridge.
At once, my lord.
Good.
What of Mr. Hornblower,
my lord?
We will give him
as long as we can.
Let us hope
he does not abandon
his customary caution.
Bring it in!
Quickly now!
Man:
Colonel!
Colonel!
What?
The enemy is massing
on the edge of town.
Your men, they need you, sir.
:
Very well.
Uh, do we take
the cannon, sir?
No, it would
take too long.
We spike them
and then fall back.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Kennedy, sir,
what do we do
if the frogs
get to the bridge?
You heard the major:
We blow it up.
Right, sir,
and then what?
Then, Styles,
we withdraw to the beach
and, uh, we hope for the best.
:
We've spiked
the guns, sir
and we've blown
the trunnions off
for good measure.
Well done, Matthews.
Edrington:
Mr. Kennedy
is the powder primed?
It is, sir.
Then lay the fuse, if you will.
Aye aye, sir.
Lay the fuse.
Colonel,
we must withdraw.
Moncoutant:
We need more men.
Send for Major
Edrington's troops.
Colonel,
our cause is lost!
You must withdraw!
I know you do not
like me, Mr. Hornblower
but this is my country.
Your fight may
be over
but mine cannot be
so quickly abandoned.
I have left here
once already.
I will not
leave again!
Pellew:
Pull!
Pull!
Come on, men, pull,
pull together!
Bracegirdle:
Captain Pellew, sir
we have a wind!
Lay on your oars!
Recall the boats,
Mr. Bracegirdle!
Aye aye, sir.
:
Pray god it's not too late.
Horatio!
Horatio!
Horatio!
Man:
All set, Matthews?
Aye aye, sir.
I believe we are
of the same mind,
Mr. Kennedy.
Perhaps we might
give it a few moments
more, my lord.
I daresay Mr. Hornblower
will surprise us yet.
Aye, sir.
If he is alive.
You can climb down,
no one will see you.
Do you suppose
for one minute
I would leave this
place without you?
Hurry!
Come with me.
I won't leave
without you.
All right, go on.
Man:
Come on!
Jump!
Ooh, !
Are you all right?
Come on.
Let me help you.
One, two, three.
:
Styles:
Sir, we've not got
much time left.
Let me do that, sir.
Make ready!
Horatio.
Edrington:
Present!
Hold your fire!
Give covering fire.
Fire!
:
No!
Edrington:
Mr. Kennedy!
Kennedy:
Horatio.
It's no good,
Horatio.
She's gone.
Come on.
Come on.
Edrington:
Well, that should hold them
for a while, at least.
Mr. Kennedy, we will retreat
to the beach
and make our stand
from there.
Aye, my lord.
March the men off,
S'arnt Major.
Sergeant:
Shoulder arms!
Mr. Kennedy.
Sergeant:
Left turn!
Quick march!
Just look after him, will you?
Of course.
Come, Horatio.
You did
all you could.
First company... hatt!
Styles:
Phew!
That's lovely, that is.
Oldroyd:
Well, take your pick:
The devil or the deep blue sea.
Edrington:
S'arnt, form the men up.
Colors to the rear.
Sergeant:
Very well, sir.
Battalion will form line.
Five sections on the right.
Right way!
March!
I believe our old
friends are upon us.
Bowles:
Ahoy!
One more step and
I'll see you in hell.
Man:
Not that frog.
That frog is
a good frog.
Man:
Bowlesy!
Man:
Good to see you.
Mr. Bowles.
I thought to see you
gentlemen in Paris by now.
Welcome back,
Mr. Bowles.
Front rank, make ready!
Sergeant:
Front rank, kneel!
No one fancies
a swim then, eh?
Present!
Fire!
Oldroyd:
It's the !
Atternate guns,
fire!
I think we are well done
with this place, Mr. Hornblower.
Aye, my lord.
Well done, indeed.
My lord.
Where's your coat, Mr. Bowles?
Welcome back,
Mr. Hornblower
Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Hornblower!
Your report in my cabin,
if you please.
Aye aye, sir.
Sir, I must report
the loss of six men
and two cannon
from the ship's company.
Not to mention
our French allies.
Yes, sir.
If a captain loses
his ship, Mr. Hornblower
he must face a court-martial
whatever the circumstances
of his defeat.
Yes, sir.
And he must defend himself
and his reputation,
do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Well, man?
Well?
Sir, I have
nothing to say.
The cannons were lost.
The men died.
And the royalist
cause...
A failure then...
like the rest of this
miserable expedition
we've been engaged upon.
Yes, Mr. Hornblower.
I include myself.
What were we
doing there, sir?
We were not wanted.
We brought nothing but...
destruction...
death...
and defeat.
Forgive me, sir.
It's all right,
Mr. Hornblower.
It's all right.
Oh, come on, man,
look at you.
Look at your new uniform.
What a sorry state.
Hardly the image we've
come to expect, is it?
Hmm?
No, sir.
When we put on this
uniform, Mr. Hornblower
we entered into a life
of adventure and adversity
but above all,
a life of duty.
A duty to our people,
our king, our country
but also,
a duty to our men.
We must always be
a source of inspiration
to them, Mr. Hornblower.
And whatever
may befall us...
whatever...
we must never forget
we are officers
in His Majesty's Navy.
Indeed, sir.
I am glad to see you
safe, Mr. Hornblower.
And I to be back, sir.
