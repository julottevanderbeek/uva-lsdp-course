THE WAR IS OVER!
Sir, I have Silver.
Would you like to buy some?
Mr. Sorowitsch? I have to
ask for an advance, please.
Is this your first time in Monte Carlo?
Very nice, it's gonna be fine,
a little adjustment, that's all.
What's a matter?
You where in the  camp?
Is this mine?
Thank you.
Solly!
Schmitz!
Where's the rest of the 150.00?
It's not the time right now,
to hand out counterfeit money!
Solly!
Can I borrow? Twenty?
- Sascha!
Talking about politics?
- Ludwig dragged me this politicle party.
"Heil, Heil, Heil!" And you
know what? I became a member!
Here, check it out, look!
That's the present he gave me.
Because I'm so nice to him.
- In bed or with the Party?
You know what, Schmitz...
If I let you let you get away with this,
Then everybody else gonna try to fuck me.
It's not because of the 150.00, It's
the fucking Princible, you understand?
This is my damn lifelyhood, and
I'll go to any extreme to protect it.
Solly, you old bandit! I want to
introduce you to a friend of mine.
Solly Sorowitsch, The
biggest Bandit of all Berlin!
Sorowitsch? Are you Russian?
I hope you're not a communist!
Enough of a communist, to
share my Champagne with you.
Solly, it's just an unusual
name, where're you from?
It' short for Salomon.
Salomon?
Ah...
You can spill the Champagne on
the floor, it's not a Rothchild.
I do trust you.
How come they're saying? "Don't
buy anything from the Jews!"
You have to act normal, or you stand out.
Don't you guys learn that from the resistence?
Exuse me, Solly.
- In 2 hours, at my place.
Okay, Solly, that's fine!
Are you leaving?
- Tonight. I got the word, I've been here to long.
If you can counterfeit the
Dollar, you can do a lot of things.
It's not perfect yet,
but sooner or later...
Did you bring the money?
You know, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.
These are my People.
- I'm me, and then there are the others.
Don't you understand, what's going
on? What the Nazis doing to us?
Why do they always pick on the Jews?
Because they don't try to fit in.
Solly! You don't have any...
- No!
Do you need an Arien-ID?
I'll make you one, that'll show Siegfried
and the Dragon in your family history.
Do you know Schiele?
Yea, I ran in to him once
in Vienna, He's the Master.
Your pictures...
I don't believe, that you're
this kind of an ass-hole.
I didn't think Hans was the type
to be used by beautyfull women.
Listen...
- Your jewlery isn't worth half that,
I need a passport from Argentinia.
I'm already packed, and ready to go.
- Hans, you can go.
I'll straighten it out
with Mr. Sorowitsch.
You're in luck...
about the argentinian passport.
Home of the Tango.
You could be a great artist.
- What do you know?
A lot.
Or I wouldn't have stayed here with you.
Earning money as an Artist?
Earning money with printing money?
Printing money is quicker, it's a shortcut.
I've got to go.
May I?
Friedrich Herzog, Criminal-Squad
Berlin, Counterfeit Dept.
It is with great Pleasure,
to arrest the best...
Counterfeiter in the world, if
that makes you feel any better.
The Dollar!
Did we get a little
bid ahead of ourselfs?
No!
Stop! Let's move!
Get up, lazy Jew-fuck!
Now get the fuck up!
You there! Take this pig away!
They're making us all!
Solly!
That's not a jail...
They want to kill us!
They're making us all.
The Capo! Melzer.
Watch out for him.
Double Murderer!
With the Green Patch: Professional
Criminal. Worse then the SS.
You don't look like...
- Hey!
If you hit me, I'll stab you to death!
I'll be watching you
guys close. Fucking pigs!
I'll finish you all!
Are you nuts? You just can't...
You can't loose Respect, you have
to have some kind of moral values.
In every jail it's the same thing.
Everybody up!
Who made this drawing?
Number 75517.
I like it.
It's looks very real, Jew.
- With color it would...
What?
- With...
With color it would
look even better, Sir.
The uniform the booths...
I did it from memory.
Die Fahne hoch, die Reihen
dicht geschlossen,
SA marschiert...
What is this?
Herr Hauptsturmführer, This is...
It's like this: I...
Kameraden, die Rotfront und Reaktion
erschossen,
marschieren im Geist
in unseren Reihen mit.
Sorowitsch!
Look at this, such a joker,
I thought so.
- I'll paint, Sir. What ever you want.
You're being relocated.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow morning.
But I haven't finished the painting.
I have to finish the painting first.
He's worried about his jew-skin.
A little jew-boy like you,
we can find anywhere.
Shit!
He smells terrible, this Jew here!
Hey...
Eat...
I always admired the russian
Avantgardisten: Kandinski, Rodschenko.
At the Academie in Odessa we had a Professor, Lebed...
- Lebed?
At my time at the academie
I became Lebed Assistend.
You went to the Academie?
Are you also Russian?
I don't like to speak Russian.
it brings back bad memories.
You rather speak german?
I...
I had a Familie.
We had a saying, Lebed
and the art is like...
a fair maiden and a good...
- Fuck.
You know it too.
Nummer 755...
Salomon Sorowitsch.
King of the counterfeiter.
SS-Sturmbannführer Herzog.
Remember me? Herzog.
Criminal-Squad Berlin,
Counterfeiter Dept.
I was the one who arrested you.
It got me a promotion that time.

Loszek, Drucker. 48, 41.
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.
You'll see, here it's a differnd
attitute and atmosphare...
then in the camps you just came from.
I would like to think
of you as my assistances,
and togather we're...
Yea...
This clothes are used.
If you rather wear prison
clothes... you can wear the stripes,
it'll make you look thinner.
What's his name?
Attantion, let's form 2 rows!
What's with this shit?
A symbolic move, looks like we're
being led to the slaughter House?
Open!
Everybody up!
Did you distribute the tooth brushes?
Taken care of the teeth is importend.
My dear Jews, I want you to meet a...
Specialist with international
Fame: Salomon Sorowitsch.
He will be the head of
the Counterfeit-Department.
Sorowitsch?
Operation Bernhard. We're counterfeiting
in a Grand Style mass production...
Passports, Documents, Banknotes...
With the newest and best
technoligy availible today.
I think, the new arivals want
to freshen up and rest a while.
Our technical assistent Atze...
is going to bring you up to date,
I wish you all good luck and sucssess.
That was a nice speach
from the Commander.
Nice beds.
Why are the giving us such nice beds?
This is still a  prison camp.
But the beds are soft.
That's good.
Anny Ondra only cleans with Sarinol.
Sarinol!
I was a Commercial
photographer in Berlin.
It's realy peacefull and quiet here.
I'm not used to it,
I forgot how nice it is.
Where are they all going?
Shoe-Testing Punishment.
They make all the
prisoners walk in a circle,
To test the Shoes.
- Testing how?
It's a punishment, if the shoes are to
small, they put sandbags on their back.
A lot of them die.
You're better off not
to watch or listen to it.
Nah? Music!
Guys, let me show you your work area.
We have men from differnd prison
camps, all are professonals:
Graphicer, printers, type-setters,
tool and die makers...
Why are they letting us
Jews do the work here?
I think they're gonna do away with
us after the war, to keep it a secret.
A Exact-Tiegel... you
ever use one of these?
Lazy pig! Faster, you
lazy god-damn bastards!
Don't worry, that's Dr. Klinger, the
Capo, the SS has to hear him scream.
You're the new arrivals? I'm
Dr. Klinger, internal Medicin.
Welcome to the golden cage.
Get this guy to me right the way.
Your foot it looks
terrible. Realy terrible.
I almost started to cry myself,
when I saw a printing machine again.
It brings back good memories. Zilinski?
- yea?
Zilinski, dark room!
Matti, can you show him our
routine of what we're doing?
And Karloff...
You're in the Graphic Dept. Go out
this door down the hall, you'll see it.
And you and I where
going to Quality Control.
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Prussen
Credit Dept. Hamburg.
Sorowitsch is going to be in
charge of the Counterfeit-Retusche.
Do you also have a financial
back ground, Mr. Sorowitsch?
Yea, our biggest problem is the Paper.
It don't feel right.
The English Pound has
the same structure...
as the linnen they use in Turkey.
We've been doing verios experiments,
but the results have been very poor.
Green Patch?
A professionel Criminal? Mr. Laube!
Mr. Sorowitsch is so to speak
a professionel Counterfeiter.
All the Criminals here so far, have
been wearing Nazi-Uniforms, Sir!
You're having a problem working
togather with a fellow prisoner?
We're not criminals, like you...
and it wont be easy for you here.
Continue.
Kiss my ass.
Free weekend! And sunday
we get to use the showers.
You fraternise with criminals?
The real criminals are your high class
citizens who've been plundering...
the masses and letting fashisum flurish.
But if a regular guy just
a piece of bread steals...
Are you talking about what I did?.
You gave one of the inmates a
peace of bread, that's solidarity.
It was soup.
You have a very low number, how did
you manage to stay alive in Auschwitz?
Good attitute.
Let's play a game?
What are we playing for?
- Our Honor.
I also win if I don't cheat.
What's a matter? Are you lazy?
This is not a vacation spot!
Here everybody works! Understand?
- Holst!
Leave the man alone.
To think is also like working,
Holst, you should try it sometimes.
Sorowitsch, just Amateurs und Idiots.
Vorgetting the
circumstances now and then.
Just us, you and me. The
perfect counterfeit of all time.
First the Pound,
and then the Dollar.
People, machines, material...
everything you need.
You know, Sorowitsch...
It's an oppertunity, to stay alive.
I can't garantee this for
everybody, but for you...
When...
Please! Can you turn
off that Nigger music?
As if the germans don't
have any Music of their own.
Something to put you to sleep:
Why is God not in Auschwitz?
He couldn't get passed
all the Skeletons!
Canada.
My Number.
I was in "Canada".
The clean-up command.
We always had food, we unpacked
the luggauge of the Newcomers,
while their owners where
sent to the Gas champer.
You try to fit in, or
you're the next one to die.
I just don't want it...
For us to have it good here,
while others out there...
My wife is still in Auschwitz.
I'm not giving the Nazis the pleasure,
of me feeling ashamed, to be alive.
Everybody attention,
So, also for the new arrivals...
Not even the Camp-Commander
knows, what we're doing here.
Don't smuggle anything out!
Everything, don't have to get out.
Everything!
Hey you, what's a matter?
- They're taking us to the Gas champer.
They need us, nothing's gonna happen.
- Come on, get undressed!
Burger!
Can you hear me? Are
you hurt? Who are you?
Leave him be! Come here!
- Dr. Klinger!
Dr. Klinger!
- Hey, you there!
What you're doing here? Who are you?
- Nr. 56484. I have...
Did anyone talk to you? Did
anyone here talk tou you?
- He was laying on the floor...
Sut up! Did he talk to you?
- I don't know him.
What did he say? Commander Hasel has...
- Are you nuts? Let's go.
Sorowitsch... What did
you talk to him about?
I did not talk with him, it's forbidden,
to talk with another prisoners, Sir.
So, come on. - Mr. Burger is
our only Dark room-Specialist.
And he did not talk to him.
Take your showers.
In the showers!
I just wanted to help him!
Let's go! Come on!
Odessa?
That's for you.
I'm sorry about what
happend in the shower.
It reminds me a little of Lukanow.
Yea?
- Do you know his scene's from the city?
Color! To bad there're no colors here.
Odessa is blue in my opinion, dark blue.
At the Academie they told
me, my style wasn't very good.
But it's my Style.
and I like it...
Thank's.
You're welcome.
Let me.
I can do it better. Why
don't you let me try it?
Everybody up!
Continue.
Number 93...
- Ahh!
So, getting everything organized?
Do you have everything you need?
The passports, we're working on...
the problem is the cover and the Paper.
With used originals we could get a...
Sorowitsch, you need to
concentrate on the british Pound.
It's very importand, to
get some results soon.
The SS-commander is
loosing his patience.
And what's that supose to be? My
five year old can do a better job!
I...
A Parazystose.
A material-flaw in the copper, plus
Loszek is a Chraphic-Specialist.
We should put him in the passport-dept.
Parazystose.
A material-flaw? a Parazystose?
Get out!
Thank you, thank you.
Don't ever try to bull-shit
me again, Sorowitsch.
We're supose to be on the same side.
Atze, the sample from the Dinar.
- Yea, it's ready.
Is this with the linnen from turkie?
- Oh, yea, that's what I thought...
Hey, get rid of it!
Rags!
The English they're using rags! Strands of
fibre with a thousent breaks and then pressed,
Everybody up!
Most of the English don't use wallets.
They use a Safety-pen to
keep the bills togather.
That's why we put the
little holes around the edges
Please.
The Negative.
We don't wont some small
time oporater out there,
spending a few lousy pounds.
Our plan is to destroy
the british economy.
If they found out to early, that
we're using counterfeit money,
That would be the end
of this program here.
And we'd have to send you all back
to the prison camps.
She realy isn't wearing any panties!
Amagine a Movie scene.
With an Agent, Producer ext. ext.
and this hot chick without panties.
Only a skirt.
Mr. wouldn't you like to take
my picture?"
"Sure, I wont even need
a  for it. "
Burger, You're standing in the Sunlight.
Solly...
if it don't work out with the pound...
we should get organized.
Yea, we have a lot of guys.
We all are in good shape,
healty and we can fight.
We also have tools.
- What? With knifes?
Against an
SS-Company? - Yea.
Before they send us to the gas-champer.
I rather wait for the gas tomorrow, then get
killed by a bullit today, one day at a time.
A rebellion.
At least that would be a sign.
Zilinski is right: You're
standing in the Sunlight.
Kolja, when did you get the fever?
It comes and goes, get's real
bad then it's good for a while,
We had TB-Cases before, I was
trying to get the medicine...
Kleinfeld, Stiasny and
Jilovsky. They just killed them,
To keep it from spreading,
Can you help him?
Let's see what I... Without medicine?
Maybe isolate him.
I'm a Doctor. Internal Medicine.
How bad is it?
No, you'll be fine, the Doctor
will get you well again.
Have to continue to live,
after KZ prison camp.
Exactly.
Quick, get the First Aid Kid!
Here are the original Documents, that
you wanted, direct from Auschwitz.
Loszek found his kids Passports
in that box from Auschwitz.
Loszek, come on don't do this.
You got to keep on living.
Only if we keep on living,
are we gonna win.
You must survive this.
Loszek, you can't give up.
You hear me? Loszek!
Hey, wake up! Everybody up!
- God-Damn Jew-basterds!
Move it!
What's going on back there?
What does it look like?
Stand straight!
Sorry to wake you guys,
I have something of interest:
A few days ago a Buisness Man
enters a Bank in Zürich.
He's has a Briefcase
full of Money.
Pound Notes.
Our Agent goes to the Manager,
to open an Account.
With pleasure, Monsieur.
I hope you understand,
for the Banks interest we have to
verify the authentisity ot the Money.
Of course.
Please. In times like this...
For a half an hour the
Experts checking our Work.
and finely they're ready.
Monsieur...
Your Bank Notes...
After a carefull and thourough
Test, we know...
without a thought they're good.
Now the agent is getting
overconfident.
Monsieur le Directeur,
Since i got the Bank Notes from kind
of of a shady Buisness Source.
I would like to be 100%
sure that they're real.
We're accepting your Pounds.
It's not nessessary...
Absoluty Sure, Monsieur.
If you realy want to do this,
I recomment you take them...
to the Bank of England
and let them do a Test.
The Bank of England. Lets see
what they had to say.
Maybe we can learn someting.
Bla,bla,bla,bla...
"... we have come the Conclution,
The Bank Notes in the
denamonation ot 5 Pounds,
are not counterfeit bills.
The Bank of England gives the garantee
the Bills are legal and tender.
The SS-Commander is very happy
and satisfied with our Work.
Our Money is so real, that the
plans have been changed.
It would be a waste, to just
drop them over England.
The German Reich is going to use it
in Buissness Transactions Worldwide.
And that's why it gave
me the Reason,
To bring you a little happyness.
As kind of an uplift.
Yea...
I thought like...
after Work or on Weekends...
Sir, I want to thank you for
the Oppertunity.
Motivation, Klinger. Motivation.
Ich befasse mich viel mit Menschen
- führung. Eine große Sache der Zukunft.
If you treat People like Dirt,
they wont be to productive.
How about if you treat Dirt
like People?
You damn Jew's... with Trick's and
Counterfeiting you're good at.
But if you look a litte deeper
at your...
Sir, I have been an upstanding
Citizien all my life.
I have to remind you, that I was
forced in to doing this work.
Very good Job, Sorowitsch.
Put yourself a Team togather,
we're starting with the Dollar next.
Don't anybody see, what's going on?
The Germans are Broke.
With out Money no Raw Material.
We're financing the War for the Nazis.
And? You gonna sabotage them?
In KZ Prison Camp?
The Americans work with Lowpress.
We use Lightpress, we can
produce greater quanitys faster.
Lightpress is also better for
sharpness and halftone.
We still have a few Problems,
but we're getting them worked out.
We have a Specialist who has
expierience with the Dollar.
Noch 'ne offene Rechnung mit dem Dollar?
We arrested you for
counterfeiting the Dollar.
That time I didn't have all
the technicel Equipment.
And now?
How much do you want?
Maybe a few hundert Million.
Atze, about the 20-Pound-Notes...
Can you show me the Testplate.
You little Whore!
Be glad that you're
in here. Idiot!
Shit, Shit, Shit.
Maye it's not the Negative, but
the mixture.
Sorowitsch's Negative's
have always been perfect.
But?
I got arrested because my wife and I
printed Anti-Nazi Flyers,
I'm not gonna print Money for
the Nazis now.
You know...
Family, small Buissness, im Wedding...
I always made sure not to have
Problems with the Law.
I didn't get involved in politics.
Gisela, my wife always said:
"We're printers, to let the truth
be known. "
Where did you learn that slogan?
Communist Printers-Union,
Youth-Group?
Sorowitsch,
If we print a lot of Dollars it could
change the outcome of the war.
We actualy could fight the Nazi's
right here!
That wouldn't only just be symbolic.
We're a live, if that means anything.
- I'm saying the same thing!
It isn't just about your stinking
little existence.
Well it's the only one I have!
- What's your reason? To want to live,
or to proof that you can actualy,
make the Dollar?!
I'm gonna keep fucking up
your negatives.
If you want, you can turn me
in and tell Herzog.
We have to pay for it,
if we don't deliver.
We all gonna have to pay for it.
Yea.
Yea.
The Bridge was blown and the
Russian Advance was stopped.
Can you believe this shit!
Warschau! Can't be happening!
Warschau! The Krauts
are being pushed back.
Continue.
You guys can't get the Dollar to work.
We're still having a Problem with
the Plate, Herr Hauptscharführer.
The Pound we can handle now ourselfs.
You know what you are, without the Dollar?
Nothing but a criminal, dirty,
fucking old Jew.
Fuck Herzog and
his "Motivation"!
I know how to get you guys,
to pay fucking attention
You're nothing but Jew-Bastards,
and do anything to save your Skin.
Realy disgusting.
Plappler!
Get Hotte. One of the sinks is
busted, tell him repair it.
I saved your fucking Ass with the
English Pound I made for you!
Dr. Klinger said you've got to eat.
Why?
A spoon for the Expressionists,
A spoon for the Avantgardists...
Eat, or I'll give you a Knuckle sandwich.
You know about raising Kids.
What's the story with your Family?
Arrested, Killed...
I could have bought their Freedom,
if I had the Money then.
Get up!
Keep walking!
I can't anymore.
What's going on?
- I wanted...
What are you waiting for?
No, please no!
Are you guys crazy?
Attention, Soldier!
What's your Name, Lame-Brain?
- Rottenführer Wegener.
You're an Idiot. Man, Man, Man,
what's with all the shooting!
You could have shot one of my Jews,
by Accident!
Those are your Jews?
- That's classified.
Game.
It's a KZ Prison Camp. Every Day
Dozends get killed. We just close our eyes
One in a Thousent. We should
be glad, we're on this Side,
Solly, hm?
Solly, stop it! Relax!
Listen up!
If you don't live to over come,
why do you want to continue living?
Sorowitsch. Atze told me,
we haven't had...
any good results, in months...
It's the copper plate, Sir.
Yea! Yea, Yea, Yea.
The other Jew told me
the same fucking Lie.
Are you guys doing it on purpose?
Sorowitsch!
Sir, we do...
- Shut up!
You guys think you can't be
replaced!
So.
Berlin wants the Dollar.
These five. Klinger,
make a list of their names.
If the Dollar isn't here in 4 Weeks
these 5 People will be shot.
Hey, Sorowitsch not there. Here.
And don't think, I can' do with out you.
Hey, Klinger!
Carnivale. A fun Evening,
Music, Dance, a little
Cabaret, Remmidemmi, yea?
There should be some talented
guys around.
Sir, you can't...
I always did my best...
He's not gonna kill us, he has to deliver,
that's why he's putting pressure on us.
What would you do in his place...
- Me in his place?
I would never put myself in
the place of an SS-Criminal.
The problem is Burger.
I have the sneake Suspision,
that he's doing it on purpose...
I watched him yesterday...
- He does it on purpose. I know.
What?
If he don't stop, then I'm...
Herzog saved everyones Life here.
He's fair.
You can talk to him.
- Keep your mouth shut, Zilinski.
You don't snitch on your Friends.
- Friends?
So your saying that we all should
die because of your politics? - Quiet!
Sit down.
Burger, the Hero!
He wanted to be a Martyre right
from the start! So let him,
But without me!
In Buchenwald I lost four Toes
because of cold weather.
In Dachau they broke my back.
In between I almost starved to dead!
I think I earned, to keep on living!
You don't squeal on Friends.
Never!
What'd you call that? Jailhouse-Honor?
Zilinski!
I'll kill you, if you snitch on him.
Burger?
Burger...
You've been stalling the Dollar
for Months. You had your Fun.
But now the Life's of our Friends
are on the line. You can't...
Gisela. My Wife.
She also was in Auschwitz.
"Escape Attempt".
That...
You're sorry about that?
Thank's.
But now the Dollar, hm?
We have to continue.
It's about our comfortble
Life's here.
About the nice Beds. The nice...
and soft Beds!
I thought I could cry about it,
Serios, But stabile.
It's a Race against time.
But with out Medicine...
What do you need?
But how...
- The Medicine!
In Theresienstadt, there was
never enough Medicine,...
...I had to choose who's,
gonna live,
and who's gonna die.
Herzog is a Bandit, with him I can.
Sorowitsch!
Sorowitsch! You need an
Invitation, or what?
Sorowitsch! Nice,
for you to drop by.
Why don't you take the Man's
Handcuffs off, my God.
It's a little chilly, or?
I wish you could see, some parts
of the U.S. East Coast.
You wont believe the terrible
Propaganda about the Prison Camps.
Friedrich, get
Mr. Sorowitsch a refill.
Can you take Kandis, as a Jew?
Friedrich told me, you've been
a dangeres Criminal, and now?
Working for a greater Cause! I don't
know anything about Politics, but...
So, Kids. Let's give Dad and his
Visitor some privacy.
Leni, Lotte,
little Friedrich...
To raise the Kids, Sorowitsch.
For them to become responsible

Are you pissed because of Kolja?
Kolja... Holst shot him.
I know what you think:
Holst is just an Order-taker.
But what do you think I am? Solly!
I always treated you guys good! In no
other Camp did you have it as good as here.
I can't save the Jews all by myself!
Sorowitsch!
You have to see for yourself,
where you stand!
You have to know that yourself!
You pissed all over yourself.
Solly!
What's going on here, Solly?
Herzog...
- You let him...?
I wanted to kill him, but...
...I let him go.
They... They'll put
us up against the Wall.
You probably would like that, hm?
For them to kill you too.
It's over. The War is over.
Nobody's gonna come anymore.
I realy don't have the Talent for being
Marthyr. Did you bring the Cards?
Dr. Klinger!
Our People have taken over the Camp.
It's over, we're free.
Dr. Klinger, Internal Medicine.
We're the Inmates

Here! Auschwitz!
Plappler, Adamovic, Hahn!
Who else was in Auschwitz?
With the Dollar-Negative
we let it get to hot,
That way the contrast was blurry.
Then they warned us and told us if
it happends again they'll kill us.
Here, Burger. That's a Hero.
Say something.
Hey? Yea... Then it was to late,
With the Dollar it would have...
changed the war. Because it would
have givin them plenty of Money.
And, oh... Here...
Sometimes we could hear
beautyfull Music.
Oh, here... The Pound, we put
the holes on the wrong Side...
Pfiffig, Hey?

Thank you very much, Monsieur.
Monsieur, Can I offer you a bottle
of Champagne it's on the House?

So much Money...
So much Money.
We can make new Money.
A Total of 132 Million Pounds,
Had been Produced
in Sachsenhausen
Wich was four times the value
of Englands Bankreserves.
Because of the stalling tatics by
the inmates at the prison camp,
Only a very small amount of the
Dollar was Produced.
Oporation Bernhard was the biggest.
Counterfeit Program of all Time.
