L"m Pernille Bech Christensen,
the editor.
- Morten Søborg, cameraman.
- L"m Susanne Bier. L"m the director.
This was added quite late
in the production process.
Before we started shooting,
we discussed -
- whether we could find
a type of images -
- that didn"t simply
tell the story. Isn"t that right?
Yes.
We talked about
things like split-screen.
Pernille,
how did we start on this?
We tried split-screen,
but it was not a good idea.
It made you schizophrenic.
And it was inaccurate.
We wanted to decide
whom you should be watching.
So we ditched that.
Then some time elapsed -
- during which we were busy
getting the structure in place.
But we felt that there was
something missing.
We took a break in the editing
for other reasons.
During that period, a lot of work
went into finding material.
Then we found out
that we wanted material -
- which wasn"t concrete
in scenic terms.
All those sequences with eyes
and reeds and stuff.
There is a connection
to the story, -
- but they"re not necessarily
part of individual scenes.
We talked about time lapse,
remember? We talked about flowers.
You should explain
what time lapse is.
It"s when you film a single image
every day for a week and play it -
- at normal speed.
So the pupa turns into a butterfly -
- in seconds.
The same with a flower.
But we couldn"t find those at first.
And now it seems like
a strange choice.
Going back to the film, -
- perhaps we should talk
about the music for a bit.
It"s really characteristic here.
- It wasn"t easy.
- We kind of had the same debate.
We wanted something with
a tone that was a bit different.
Part of the film
takes place in Afghanistan.
We wanted to incorporate
that into the music.
At the same time,
the film is based is Denmark, -
- so there also had to be
this Scandinavian...
We spent a lot of time trying to
make that connection.
Ulrich and Nikolaj
are in their stride now.
Maybe we should explain why
we chose two actors -
- who don"t look like each other
to play brothers -
- in a film called "Brothers".
I feel that there"s something
in their eyes that is similar.
And their parents,
Bent Mejding and Solbjørg Højfeldt, -
- each resemble one of them.
That often happens in families.
One child looks like one parent,
the other child resembles the other.
That"s why we did it this way.
Morten, would you like to say
something about shooting in cars?
Here it"s difficult to see
where the camera is.
After some thought we altered
a longer car so it looked...
We put the front seats
where the backseat was -
- and the backseat in the boot.
So we turned an estate
into a small family saloon.
The car is being towed.
L"m where the wheel and pedals are.
We took out the front seats.
- I think it worked very well.
- The viewers won"t think about it.
If you know a lot about cars, you"ll
see that the doors look different.
But you really get the feeling
that they are driving in their Polo.
Maybe you should explain why?
Normally, you shoot this with
a camera fixed to the car outside.
Or the camera
is on a crane on the car -
- towing the one with the actors.
But this film is shot
with hand-held cameras.
We wanted to be close to the actors.
In the car with them.
We wanted to preserve
this hand-held feel -
- and be able
to pan from one to the other.
The funny thing about a film
which is hand-held and...
...and has...
Not that it is a Dogma film,
but there is a certain Dogma look.
It took a lot of technical stuff
to keep the nearness of Dogma -
- but still be free from it.
Like in the car.
Here we"re in a house
up in Farum, -
- which we rented and redecorated.
In a Dogma film,
you find an actual house.
We could make it look
exactly the way we wanted.
That gives a certain freedom. But
also a compulsion to think about -
- what this family looks like
and how they live and so on.
Why did you choose this, rather
than building it on a soundstage?
Because of people
walking in and out and stuff.
And the texture of a real house.
This house has three floors.
You can look out of the window.
The sense of reality is far better -
- than a studio set.
And you can let the scene go on -
- when they leave the room.
Another thing we kept
from Dogma was...
We shot the scenes...
This scene starts
with someone ringing the door.
We follow them all the way in
until they"re seated at the table.
In a traditional shoot, it would be
divided into different positions.
Like you film the brothers
saying hello at the door -
- and their mother coming in.
It gives the acting a different flow.
The same goes for the sound.
We took care that every line -
- is in the same good quality,
even if the actor is off-camera.
So the mike is on them all the time,
so they have to keep acting.
This means that they have
microphones in their hair.
You can"t cover a whole scene
like this with a boom mike.
So they have mikes in their hair,
which annoyed them at times.
But they are necessary
if you want good sound -
- and if they are to go on acting -
- even though
they are not in a close-up.
This way of shooting, doing
a whole scene from start to finish, -
- gives you freedom... You don"t
have to decide about a scene -
- until you"re sure
you"re happy with it.
It"s possible to change the acting.
Whereas traditional shooting -
- would mean that you"d be
stuck with a certain beginning.
So they have to play
in a fixed direction -
- even though new ideas might
come up. We used this very often.
For example,
with the master shot.
We nearly always changed it
when the acting really buzzed.
Started with that, then try to get
closer and finishing with the same.
Maybe we should explain
the master shot.
In a traditional film,
you start with an establishing shot -
- with all the people in the scene,
then move in closer on individuals.
In a traditional film, you"re tied
down by this establishing shot.
We often do this wide shot
and then make close-ups.
Sometimes you don"t know
what a person feels...
Or rather, the director doesn"t
know what the actor should feel -
- until the close-ups. You can"t
really see it until you see the eyes.
Once we"ve seen that, we often
change the establishing shot.
And then it"s easy to do.
You can"t just change the order.
You have to be aware of all the
characters" physical relations -
- before shooting close-ups.
When you get the feeling right, -
- you can keep the physical pattern,
but with much stronger feelings.
But this presumes...
If you want that freedom, -
- it"s nearly always...
This scene was completely ad-lib.
Nearly all the light comes from lamps
you can tolerate in the frame.
Usually, you rig up the lights
and change it scene by scene.
This means you can"t go back
and change the establishing shot.
Here we are in Afghanistan,
which is actually Spain.
This is a closed airfield in Spain.
While we were shooting,
a plane suddenly came in.
- Yes. It tried to land.
- Putting us all in great danger.
So it wasn"t quite closed.
But it was interesting to have
this mix of Copenhagen -
- and something that was totally
different and deserted.
- And not safe.
- Copenhagen?
We cut back and forth to
pictures from Copenhagen -
- to create a mix of the two worlds.
Jens Peter Johansen. Hardly knows
how to wipe his own bottom.
Here we tried one of the interesting
things that happen in every film.
There are always scenes that
are meant to provide information -
- on certain people and actions.
You feel tied down by them -
- when writing the script,
and also when editing.
But as you go along, you realize how
much information you can take out.
And people still understand.
It gets you every time.
If you knew this in advance,
you could axe a lot of scenes, -
- which would make the producer
happy because he saves money.
But you can"t do that because you
only find out as you go along -
- what information can be discarded.
Here we had much more information
about his mission which we axed.
You just see that he"s arrived and
stuff. You don"t get to know much.
Here"s a helicopter that is not
there. It was computer-generated.
So I shot a non-existent helicopter.
This was shot at Værløse airbase.
Yes, in a real helicopter.
But the scenery was shot in Spain
without a helicopter.
It will crash in a moment.
Talk us through the technical stuff.
This explosion is just a flash and
smoke, and me shaking the camera.
This is the C.G. Helicopter
crashing, -
- but the explosion was made
by our special-effects people.
- In Spain?
- Yes.
So the smoke and the fire are real.
And the computer guys shot -
- debris falling into the water
and ripples and stones.
We spent half a day throwing
stones into the water and stuff...
Here"s a scene
which was in the script.
But the editor was sure
we didn"t have it.
She"s usually right,
but the director was happy -
- to discover
that it actually was that scene.
I could say something about
editing... No, l"d better not.
Go on.
In the old days, we used to cut
film which had more detail.
Now we edit on a computer.
We hadn"t spotted that -
- Connie"s breasts were visible.
She had a contract
dealing with nudity.
We were not allowed to show it.
But we almost didn"t see it
until we viewed the final film.
Then someone shouted: "Help!
What"s that in the bathtub?"
So we had to hide them
digitally under some water.
No one had seen it
when we were editing.
This scene just now had a very
long dialogue, which was cut too.
Because when two men
in uniform come -
- and she cries,
we understand what has happened.
On the other hand, you can"t
do it like that in a script, -
- so you do write a long scene,
which you shorten afterwards.
You know that when two men
in uniform ring the door, -
- it"s bad news.
And we"ve just seen
a plane crashing.
This is the scene where Nikolaj
Lie Kaas had really been drinking -
- before playing drunk. I don"t think
it came as a shock to anyone.
Actors use different tools to reach
a certain state.
It"s quite normal to want to feel
a little alcohol when playing drunk.
- He does a really good job.
- He really was drunk.
Well, he remembered his lines.
It wasn"t that bad.
- He didn"t make a single mistake.
- A car will come by in a moment.
I had arranged for that,
so you could see him.
He came up to me:
"Amazing! The same car keeps
driving by at the same time."
I played along. "Yes, it"s crazy.
Are you serious?"
He believed it. I told him the next
day that we had arranged it.
So he must have been a little drunk.
- She looks so damn great.
- Yes, it"s so annoying.
- And practically without makeup.
- It is without makeup.
We tried to find things where
she looks ugly, but we couldn"t.
- It"s so unfair.
- It is, in a way.
- She looks better on film.
- No, she looks great in real life.
Yes, but there"s something
on film that...
She can really carry a close-up.
We have to hand her that.
Here comes the car.
The advantage of working
with a hand-held camera is -
- that we can actually shoot
in such a small house.
In the traditional way it would
be nearly impossible to shoot.
- Isn"t it a terraced house?
- Yes.
When you work like that,
you can consistently choose -
- what benefits the story
and the characters the most.
If you let the parents
live in such a house, -
- you don"t have to choose
what is practical for the crew.
You normally end up with solutions
that are practical for the crew, -
- but not the best thing
for the story.
Michael"s dead.
I think the smaller, the better.
The narrower and lower it is,
the better.
It gives the images
a three-dimensional effect.
I think this is one of Anders Thomas"
most brilliant lines.
When she talks about Mozart and The
Beatles instead of expressing grief.
Anders Thomas can really be human
without being mawkish.
Here we discussed
for a long time -
- when to let the audience know
that he was alive.
Since it"s Ulrich Thomsen,
it"s kind of obvious -
- that he doesn"t die that soon.
We...
This scene went in and out
of the movie a few times.
It got back in because
we wanted to prolong the grief.
We wanted the audience
to realize -
- what it meant to the relatives.
You constantly have to weigh
the pros and cons -
- of taking the plot further, or
whether to focus on the characters, -
- so you"re with them
when you move on.
Here we made
a very distinctive choice -
- to let them feel their emotions -
- before we continued
with Ulrich Thomsen"s story.
Those children are so great.
They"re just...
Maybe you should talk about
how to get them to cry.
It varies. There are different
methods of getting them to cry.
You can use makeup
for their eyes and so on.
But that doesn"t work
if they don"t act it well.
In American films you often see fake
tears rolling down a child"s cheek, -
- and you don"t feel anything.
But these girls
really dug into their roles.
Here we made
a really beautiful scene.
We had been cutting to Ulrich
being found and driven to the camp -
- in a Godfather-like way.
So it switches back and forth.
It was very beautiful, -
- but it was sacrificed
for the sake of the story.
And it was the right thing to do.
But it was tough.
That day, the editor and the director
had a major falling-out.
It was difficult to do.
But it was a bit too much format.
It makes you puke when
you hear this "kill you, darling".
It"s so damn annoying.
But in a way it is true.
Because sometimes you have to
sacrifice something you like -
- to take the story further
or to outline the characters more.
Sometimes you have to discard
something for the sake of the whole.
It would be distracting to know
here that he was alive.
It would ruin the dialogue.
Because the other part kept
coming in.
I can"t feel it.
Don"t you think l"d feel it
if he was dead?
This line, of course, fits nicely
with the fact that we know by now -
- that he is alive.
Here"s one of my
favourite scenes.
There has been some criticism
of the parents.
Bent Mejding
and Solbjørg Højfeldt.
I think they played fantastically.
People felt they were clichéd.
It is not the way they act,
but the way they are written.
I think that"s unfair, too.
They"re terrific.
Seeing how
little space they get, -
- they create an image
I think is very recognizable.
I think this scene
is absolutely superb.
Do you understand? Do you?
And the minor parts
have to be forceful.
- Let"s go, for Christ"s sake.
- Give me the keys. L"ll drive.
Give me the fucking keys!
I think he"s touching
and very funny, too.
- But not in this particular scene.
- Yes, he is. "Move over."
"Daddy sits here."
That"s funny.
The reeds again.
This is in Spain.
We alternate between them
driving home while he is found.
So we still alternate between Denmark
and Spain, like we did on the bus.
- Denmark and Afghanistan.
- We did say it was Spain.
It was a pleasure to work
with these English actors.
Yes, they were really good.
And I think they enjoyed it, because
they"re used to more rigid methods.
It stimulated them that
things were so flexible -
- and that the camera
was so flexible.
And the chance to play something
else than a doctor or a lawyer.
One of them said
the only calls he got were -
- for minor parts
as a doctor or a lawyer in TV-series.
If you"re an Indian or look ethnic,
you"re always in a hospital -
- as a doctor or lawyer.
That"s what they said.
So I think they really had fun
playing the bad guys.
It was a gigantic project
to build this camp.
We were terrified that it wouldn"t
work, that it would look bogus.
We had all sorts of military
and ethnic experts -
- to keep us from making mistakes.
We suddenly had our permit
for the first location withdrawn.
So after we"d started filming in
Denmark, the set designer had to -
- go back to Spain
to find a new location.
- The house was there.
- Yes, with a couple of changes.
This room didn"t exist,
and there wasn"t much of a roof.
So they made some changes.
But again,
we started with a location.
We didn"t build it on a sound stage.
Then we couldn"t have followed him
into the room and improvised.
Everything would have been settled:
"You look out there."
"In two months,
we will shoot what you see."
We discussed whether those
palm trees belonged in Afghanistan.
They have palm trees.
Maybe not as high, but they do.
- Kurt said so.
- We believe Kurt.
But it"s not that important
for the story where it is.
This is another scene that...
I love scenes like this, where she
irons his shirt although he"s dead.
I don"t know why.
It just has something very simple
about it that"s really beautiful.
But quite unrealistic.
Not many living men
get their shirts ironed.
Well, okay...
Here"s more parallel action.
We use that a lot.
It"s a balancing act to keep
so many balls in the air.
We had quite a few screenings
along the way -
- where opinions differed on
when to go to which story.
It"s a balancing act.
You can"t make everyone happy.
In the end we decided that
we had to be happy with it.
Some felt we should stay with
Connie and Nikolaj longer -
- before going back to...
Ulrich again.
There were many different versions.
But we ended up simplifying it.
We started by cutting
back and forth many times, -
- but we reduced it more and more.
And we watched other films too, -
- such as "The Deer Hunter"
and "The Godfather".
They are our role models.
The DVD also had a commentary.
And they actually had
the same issues in both films.
There had been much more
cross-cutting at first.
You might say that...
It"s interesting to have
parallel progress.
Cross-cutting works really well
in thrillers, -
- where the story is really driven
by the plot in both locations.
When the story is about emotion,
too much alternation...
It"s the same in novels.
You never get pause with the
characters and their emotions.
So you sort of lose interest.
That was our dilemma.
We talked about abrasive
cutting between scenes.
They"re still there,
only a lot fewer.
Here we are in a car at night, which
entails many interesting things.
Let"s not forget our stuntman,
who waited until 4 in the morning -
- only to be edited out.
She was supposed to hit a cyclist.
Evil, evil editor.
Many films have big scenes -
- which were very important
during filming, -
- but end up being edited out.
That"s because film
is an organic process, -
- which develops its own truth
at different moments.
Lots of important things
just don"t work.
Or rather,
the focus shifts to something else.
I don"t think it"s that bad,
the stuff we end up cutting out.
Actually,
we use most of our material.
On this one we didn"t cut out nearly
as much as on "Open Hearts".
We really cut a lot on that one.
The script was too long as well.
It"s one page per minute average.
I can"t remember the number, -
- but we knew it was too long. But
it was difficult to say in advance:
"Should this scene stay in
ahead of this one?"
Here the girls can flip pancakes
in a big way. They loved that.
- And Nikolaj has a hangover.
- A real hangover?
No. But he did it very well.
It"s tough to get little girls
who are flipping pancakes -
- to stand in the same spot
when they say their lines.
- And making them say it.
- No, they were fantastic.
Yes, they were.
When we read the scene
we thought: "Oh dear."
But it was a positive surprise
when we shot it.
Granddad!
Hi.
Come on, girls.
Granddad"s waiting.
We also put the kitchen
in the place where we wanted it.
- It"s not actually there at all.
- We moved it to a better spot.
We put up a kitchen there.
I think it was in their TV-lounge.
We did it because their kitchen
was far from the story.
This kitchen is very central,
and it can be seen from above -
- and from the side.
I completely forgot about this.
Sometimes when the actors turn up in
the morning in their own clothes, -
- I get annoyed. Because Nicolaj
should be Jannik, not himself.
It"s the same with places
in the film.
And with deleted scenes.
Sometimes you totally forget -
- that they were there at all. Once
they"re on the cutting room floor, -
- they disappear from memory.
Don"t be like your mother!
What"s done is done.
It"s no good crying over spilt milk.
I just want to be left in peace!
I don"t want to listen
to any more crap!
I think this is great, too.
And I love these double shots
with both characters, -
- so you don"t have to cut
to see the other one"s emotion.
- It"s a pleasure to edit this.
- It"s due to the way they act too.
Usually, people just stand there
and look at each other.
It"s great to see them
looking away.
I mean, you can"t look at someone
all the time while talking to them.
When you have a flexible
and moving camera, -
- you get much more natural
body language.
I also think the actors feel more
responsible for being present.
They can"t lean on not having
to do anything for a while.
But it"s hard on them. Those dinner
scenes really wore some people out.
We shot them 12-14 times.
Let"s talk about the film"s
only purely comical scene.
This scene was much longer.
I fought until the very end -
- to keep it long.
I knew it wasn"t possible, -
- but as a director, you do get
fed up with watching your own stuff.
It"s really nice to have a funny
scene, so you really try to keep it.
- And it really is funny.
- But it was very long.
You ruined my pants!
Aren"t you a bit of a moron?
- What"s going on?
- I spilled paint on him.
Where"s the toilet?
Again, how do you balance
this comic relief with the narrative?
You can only do it by maintaining
the dramatic red thread.
Keeping the scene relevant
because...
Here she gives
Michael"s clothes away, -
- where she still ironed them earlier
because she thought he was alive.
Now she accepts that
he won"t be coming back.
This means that... like...
...you can accept a funny scene.
There is great pain beneath.
Here Nikolaj sees it too.
That Sarah is giving
Michael"s clothes away.
It sort of confirms
that Michael is gone.
Why don"t you take everything?
After this scene
we edited out quite a lot.
There was a complicated sequence
where he left, then called, -
- then she called and he came back.
We made it simpler -
- by cutting to them
sitting by the fireplace.
It"s coming in a moment.
So he actually never left.
Here we changed things around.
The scene after this one -
- was originally before this.
It was where he arrived.
It"s the same thing again.
When you read a written script
you have to make sure -
- you and everyone else
is clear on what"s going on.
Then when you actually look into
someone"s eyes, it says so much.
It means you can do without a lot of
lines and other information.
That"s great, because you
really are inside the story.
I still get...
It"s really funny to see -
- how much is possible.
What a broad framework you have.
But here was something
that could not be done.
This story starts with
the two brothers in the car -
- and Michael telling Jannik -
- that he has to apologize
to the girl at the bank.
At some point
we wanted to take that out, -
- but then this scene
wouldn"t make sense.
It was important for the
understanding of Jannik"s character.
That when his brother died,
a lot of things happened to him.
This little, rebellious
and destructive boy he had been -
- becomes irrelevant. He wants
to be constructive and caring.
But if we took out one small scene, -
- a lot of things about his character
wouldn"t be clear.
So it"s a very fine line.
Yes, it is.
This is the arrival scene
turned into a farewell scene.
There are many close-ups
in this film, and I just love it.
You made
some great close-ups, Morten.
This was another example of...
You need some scenes
to show the passing of time.
Again...
There"s a sensuality about the
characters, which isn"t informative -
- but...
You might say that the whole process
from the script -
- to the filming process is
about sensualising the story.
This can be done in different ways.
The more...
The more sensual it becomes,
the more you can empathize.
- Isn"t it also the body language?
- That"s the same thing.
You can cut out
the explanatory lines.
A look, or two people avoiding
eye contact, says so much.
Like when these two
don"t look at each other.
- A bicycle!
- It was the girls" idea.
- Isn"t it lovely?
- It"s beautiful.
It"s got a little giraffe.
Here Connie used a bit of a funny
accent when she said bicycle.
We wondered if we could dub that,
because the girls are shouting.
But we could. We were
a bit worried about the girls, -
- but they did a great job.
You can"t see that it"s been dubbed.
When we"re talking
about music and what have you...
Here again...
Traditionally you turn up
the music when people kiss.
But I think we learned from Dogma.
It has a kind of nakedness -
- that makes it more moving than
when you pile on all sorts of things.
Here we practically
removed the sound.
Only the intimate sounds remain.
So you enter their space or whatever.
Here we cut a really nice scene
that we can discuss later.
Shall we do that later?
Here Nikolaj trips.
He"s just so good at that.
In this image we see the advantage of
using a real house instead of a set.
This was shot while the kitchen
was redecorated.
If you look carefully,
you can see spatters of paint.
- Luckily, people don"t.
- We made it a bit dark on purpose.
We did.
I think this next scene is so cute.
This is really a
romantic comedy scene.
Here we have two people
insisting that...
...there"s nothing going on
between them.
While their eyes are
telling a different story.
Especially Nikolaj"s.
He can"t help looking at her -
- even though he"s saying
"Yes, that"s right."
"Lt"s absolutely platonic. It"s just
because we miss my brother."
I always thought you were a bastard.
Well, I always thought you were
a boring, petit bourgeois dyke.
I would really like
to be able to come here.
You can come any time you want.
You can have a key.
Often... l"m thinking of how
the editing process used to be.
We cut away from a scene earlier
and cut into scenes later.
The decision on where to do it...
You have to feel that after you"ve
put the whole structure together.
That"s why we have a beginning
and an ending to every scene.
- They come through the door...
- Even though it"s not in the script.
Yes, we always do that.
And there is exactly
the number you need.
Even though you only do it in 8%% %
of the film, you have to do it, -
- because it"s fatal
when it"s not there.
It"s good for the actors as well
to start a little bit earlier.
Here we have
Ulrich"s fantastic blue eyes.
They"re quite shocking in real
life, too. But here in the sun...
- Are they genuine?
- Yes.
Apart from a little extra colour.
They"re absolutely fantastic
when you face him.
Here we do montage again,
which was great -
- after having edited Dogma films.
It was marvellous.
Not that I missed it.
It was just nice to do.
Another example of Susanne
as an action director.
- Oh, well.
- You developed a taste for it.
Yes, it was fun.
We had a group of English actors
to play Afghans -
- and some Arabs.
In the Taleban camps
both groups are present, -
- and they speak both languages.
Pashtun and Arabic.
People asked why they don"t speak
Afghanistan"s main language.
That"s because they speak
both languages in the camps.
It was interesting with those
actors in that they felt...
They represented their
most macabre side.
They thought it was interesting
and perhaps a little bit frightening.
And we had the military with us
at all times.
Special officers from...
From the special forces.
So everything they do is accurate.
You shouldn"t fabricate too much.
It has to be credible.
We got very competent
assistance in that respect.
And it was fun, wasn"t it, Morten?
We learned a lot.
Like, this was not scripted. But when
military people show you the ropes -
- it becomes nicely concrete...
In the script,
it"s not explained what he does.
And in the script they spoke English.
We changed that.
It felt more alienating
that they spoke a language -
- our characters didn"t understand.
We put in an interpreter.
It felt much more authentic.
He translated the things that
were significant for the story.
Release the gyro,
you hear a high-pitched tone.
You elevate.
And sometimes he doesn"t translate.
It has to work both ways.
It"s a stressful scene to shoot,
taking place in the sunset.
The sun sets quickly out there,
so we had to hurry.
We got it at the last moment.
Here we tried to blur time -
- and make intangible
how many days they"ve been there.
By cutting "discontinuously".
But, Morten, we could say
that whole thing in Spain...
We had five days for something
that should take nine days to film.
So I felt we were fighting against
the setting sun constantly.
That"s why there aren"t many
pictures of the scenery.
What there is we did
in ten minutes, on a day -
- when we had finished
before the sun went down.
We used the same shot,
graded differently.
But it was lucky
that you managed it.
It works. And it was a lovely day.
I must say that...
The whole Spain thing was...
We kept our fingers crossed.
And we were so relieved
when we were done.
It was like jumping
off the deep end -
- and hoping for the best.
What we had to do was so difficult,
and we had so little time.
Wasn"t there something about Paw
coming in at the last minute -
- because the original actor was ill?
- Yes.
- He had an eye infection.
We were an actor short
the day we were scheduled to start.
So Paw Henriksen was flown in.
Luckily, he had time...
Quite brilliant that he could
take over like that.
Sometimes I feel that things -
- that are the biggest gamble
and most fragmented -
- turn out better.
When you have plenty of time, -
- there"s a kind of slackness.
I like that kind of adrenalin rush -
- when you simply can"t afford
mistakes. It"s exciting.
To live he must be of use.
He"s of no use.
Now you can"t imagine
it being any other way.
It was quite revolting
to do this scene, right?
- I thought it was fun to do.
- I believe you.
- But I felt...
- This is how it should be.
I thought it was fun to do, too,
but it was revolting as well.
I can always tell by looking
at my assistant, Michael.
When he starts to get queasy,
it"s good.
It looks different through a camera,
but he"s watching with his own eyes.
So he"s a pretty good yardstick.
I seldom feel affected when I edit,
but this was unpleasant to do.
And the sound.
Every time we got to it...
It"s funny. When you"ve been editing
footage for a period of time -
- and then have public screenings,
it starts to leave you a little cold.
But every time I was
at a public screening -
- I left the room here.
I just had to pop to the toilet.
There"s something
about this scene...
It"s hardest on the cameraman.
Like here. The place where there
is the most power -
- automatically sucks in the camera.
So I don"t think...
People, who film real people
being shot, just do it too.
It"s something else
when you see it through a camera.
At first we had a lot of effects here
like two simultaneous images -
- and a jump in frames
and all that.
We discovered that it got most
intense by keeping it clean.
I was just a bit worried about
Ulrich swinging that iron rod -
- because here it"s a real one.
And l"m quite close.
We had a real iron rod
and a foam rubber one.
Some shots were done with the
fake one, others with the real rod.
We had a few stunt experts
to help us make it look violent -
- and at the same time ensure that
nobody got hurt. But we really...
- Because Ulrich really let rip.
- Yes, he did.
I remember we discussed that it
had to be certain that he was dead -
- before you left.
I was worried that you might choose
a solution that left any doubt -
- whether he was dead or not.
I remember you said, "He has
to be killed good and proper."
- I did.
- And he was.
