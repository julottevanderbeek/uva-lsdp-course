BERLIN"," 1 926
Otto Braun"," professor"," member of
the German Communist Party-
Accused of inciting pubIic
disorder"," organizing---
workers' strikes and
street demonstrations---
against the government-
Betraying the German nation---
reveaIing state secrets to the
Soviet Union"," formerIy Russia---
What's going on?
Arrest that woman!
Have them reIease the prisoner!
Drop your guns!
Have the prisoner
reIeased or I'II fire!
The keys!
Don't move and
nobody wiII get hurt!
Outside! Quick!
Are we aIready in
Soviet territory"," comrade?
At Iast! I Iooked Iike my mother
or how she fancied her daughter-
I never met your mother","
nor your father-
I never knew you enjoyed
famiIy gatherings so much-
There are endIess shortages
in the Soviet Union---
even food-
But there is freedom and in the
future"," no one wiII go hungry-
This struggIe has no
return ticket"," OIga-
I've made up my mind-
I don't intend to return-
AII those months in prison---
I missed you-
ChiIdren and famiIy
are not for us"," Otto-
We went over aII that
before you were arrested-
You can fight aIongside me-
I fight aIongside the RevoIution","
not a man-
We want bread! We want jobs!
"Down wlth the go"v"ernment!"
We want bread! We want jobs!
Down with the government!
---infIation"," the economic crisis-
ApoIogies for having---
to ask for heIp yet again-
OIga!
As if your putting the famiIy
to shame weren't enough---
now you get into fights
Iike some street urchin!
You're our daughter---
and whiIe you Iive under this
roof"," you owe us respect-
-What the heII happened?
-There was a demonstration-
The Nazis arrived-
I had to defend myseIf-
You'II end up getting yourseIf arrested!
Your actions have consequences!
You won't have to bother
anymore with what I do---
nor with my negIigence-
-I'm Ieaving-
-Where wiII you go?
I'II get a job in BerIin-
Pay for what I eat and wear---
sIeep under my own roof-
Are you trying to humiIiate
your father and I?!
You don't need to work!
You are my onIy daughter","
born to be waited upon!
Why do you pretend
to be working cIass?
How many dresses have you
got Ieft? How many shoes?
And jeweIry?
I'II bet there's enough to feed
aII the town's beggars!
There are peopIe who have Iost
far more than you in this crisis-
-I just want to support them!
-Losing you won't cost me much more!
You never cared never kept
me company nor consoIed me-
You're hardIy even a woman-
The great Iawyer of the
eviIs of the worId-
Deep down"," it's aII your fauIt","
Dr- Benário-
Leaving your famiIy for a
miserabIe BerIin suburb---
with peopIe you hardIy know","
is that the Iife you want?
AII those workers coming
to you for heIp---
I grew up seeing misery
caII on us every day-
How couId I be
immune to aII that?
Your way of speaking","
your extremism-
RebeIs rareIy make
good revoIutionaries-
What about you?
Whose side are you on"," anyway?
You give aIms"," yet defend
the government"," the rich!
Grand words won't change
the worId"," nor feed anyone!
This revoIution can onIy
bring more suffering---
UnfortunateIy"," poIitics is the
art of that which is possibIe-
So what do you suggest?
More aIms? Compassion?
Whose side are you on?
Yours"," chiId-
Yours-
Father"," I don't know
what it is I want-
But I do know what I don't want-
Take care of yourseIf-
We had to free our comrade
Otto Braun from prison-
MOSCOW"," 1 928
And I'd Iike you aII to know
that in doing so I fuIfiIIed two duties:
one to the party---
and one to my heart-
We're facing a decisive
moment in worId history-
The Fascist movement
is spreading---
and we must be
prepared to fight it-
I want miIitary training---
so we can fight for the
victory of the revoIution!
Fight for a worId with
no injustices---
no misery"," and no wars!
Long Iive the RevoIution!
Fine words!
Between a speech here and
a parachute jump there---
you'II have IittIe
time to be a woman-
DiscipIine"," efficiency","
totaI dedication-
You'II be our perfect
revoIutionary-
-Have you any objection?
-No"," not I!
My name is EIise Ewert-
Sabo to my friends-
In Germany I heard much about
you and your husband---
ex-member of ParIiament
Arthur Ewert-
The revoIution in China","
the actions in the US---
and his differences
with the Party-
No greater madness than to
try and put the worId straight-
But doesn't the worId need that?
To make beIieve the dream is
possibIe is no easy task"," OIga-
I onIy hope you are successfuI-
Or at Ieast more successfuI
than most-
I swear by the RevoIution
and by the Party!
The battaIion crossed over
fighting BraziIian
government troops!
It's unbeIievabIe!
Pure revoIutionary overkiII!
I read it in the papers!
They were fighting poverty---
and the corruption of
those in power!
The battaIion was caIIed the
Prestes CoIumn after its Ieader---
-Luis CarIos Prestes-
-Did they overthrow the government?
No- But there wasn't
a singIe defeat-
Wherever he went"," everyone caIIed
Prestes the ''Knight of Hope-''
Comrade"," are you sure they
marched 25","000 kms?
That's Iike going from Moscow to
BerIin and back"," nearIy 1 0 times!
I swear it by the RevoIution!
Just imagine if we couId be there","
fighting aIongside them?
The Prestes CoIumn-
Good evening-
Comrade OIga?
Thank you-
"A re"v"olutlon ln Latln Amerlca,"
comrade Manullskl?!
Soon the whoIe worId wiII be
Communist"," comrade OIga-
I am sure of it"," the whoIe worId-
Except perhaps SwitzerIand-
We'II need a pIace to take a break
from Communism"," won't we?
I am pIeased you've
accepted this mission-
It is my duty to accept it-
You wiII go to BraziI---
in charge of the security of
Captain Luis CarIos Prestes-
Comrade Prestes-
Comrade OIga-
I've heard much about you-
Your victories and
Ieadership of the CoIumn-
Nothing comparabIe to
what comes next-
I hope you two
wiII get aIong---
since you'II have to pretend
to be man and wife-
A weaIthy coupIe on
their honeymoon-
I wiII make sure you get to
BraziI safeIy- Do not worry-
The necessary measures
have aIready been taken-
You'II go to France first---
Forgive me for this
separation"," mother-
If at Ieast you couId
teII us something-
When do you expect
to get to BraziI?
The Iess I teII you","
the safer you'II be-
I know you have duties","
so I won't compIain-
I onIy wonder whether
this is the right time-
I'm afraid of what they might
do to you"," if you're caught-
-I'II be safe-
-You're a wanted man in BraziI-
President Vargas aIways wanted
either your support or your death-
You shouId stay Ionger in Moscow-
I don't want to Iive in
exiIe anymore-
It's time to return-
I've no more time to Iose-
I know your thoughts---
your feeIings---
every word-
Every gesture-
I'II aIways be with you-
Promise you'II never
Ieave mother aIone-
Those footsteps-
I know I'II never hear
them again-
Ever-
These are our new passports-
Senhor and Senhora ViIar-
FareweIIs are aIways tough-
That's why I prefer having
no one to say good-bye to---
or waiting for me-
What about your famiIy?
I haven't seen them for a Iong
time- It is better that way-
FeeIings and doubts are
unsuitabIe for any mission-
Let's go- It's a Iong way-
You remind me of my mother-
The same frankness---
the tone of voice of
a determined woman-
Mistress of your own destiny-
Does she dance weII?
Sorry for treading on your foot-
And my fauIts? Are they simiIar
to Dona Leocádia's?
Your nerves seem
to be made of steeI-
And you can be rather---
Harsh- My work demands it-
Do you get aIong
with your mother?
I admire her- She raised me
and my sisters by herseIf-
Taught me to fight injustices-
My country can be crueI
to those without money-
You must be anxious
to swing into action-
We've been preparing for that-
We'II act at the right moment-
You Iook particuIarIy
attractive tonight-
It's part of the disguise-
These expensive cIothes
are outrageous-
I know it is our work---
but certain intimacies---
If I have been too forward---
You are the most gentIemanIy
army captain I've ever met-
Yet your situation can't be easy
having to protect a man-
I was trained for it-
Midnight at Iast!
Happy New Year!
The Captain himseIf asked me
to bring you both champagne-
Aren't you going to kiss her?
It's New Year!
She's your wife!
''To iIIuminate forever-''
''IIIuminate everything- ''
''To the Iast days of eternity-''
''IIIuminate"," nothing more-''
''That is my motto","
and that of the sun-''
That poem certainIy suits you-
Soon you'II be safe in BraziI","
and our IittIe farce wiII be over-
You couId stay with us-
Your experience wouId be usefuI-
I am sureIy to be given
another task-
That kiss"," OIga----
I know you didn't want to-
The situation forced it on us-
I did want to-
Good morning!
I hope the Iong journey
isn't tiring you"," Senhora ViIar-
I'd never forgive myseIf-
At Ieast there are no
spies on board-
Funny"," but ever since
the Russian RevoIution---
there's aIways a hint
of conspiracy in the air-
-Don't you agree"," Herr Fischer?
-Yes-
The sea never tires me"," Captain-
It soothes me-
Even if we were in the middIe
of a war"," I'd feeI comforted-
That must be because
you Iive in Lisbon-
The Portuguese Iove the sea-
Forgive me my rudeness"," but---
are you a Jew?
What do you think?
No"," of course not-
Thank God!
Do you advocate the principIes
of Nazi Fascism"," Herr Fischer?
Like aII true Germans-
The Jewish bankers
ruined Germany-
They and the VersaiIIes Treaty-
EngIand and France wanted
to humiIiate us-
Fascism wiII protect us
from the Communists---
and we wiII be a great
nation once again-
Captain"," you're wanted
on the bridge-
Pity- The chat was as agreeabIe
as your company"," Senhora ViIar-
Do excuse me-
Herr Fischer seems suspicious-
Another Nazi wanting an audience
for his dreadfuI speeches-
Where does such hatred come from?
And the Captain?
What do you think?
He was onIy trying to
drum up some attention-
-Whose attention?
-Yours-
-Didn't you notice?
-What are you taIking about?
Senhor and Senhora ViIar
don't exist-
It's fiction"," a Iie-
You'II catch coId-
I meant no offense by suggesting
other men's interest in you-
I know you're a seasoned
revoIutionary-
-You've no need to expIain-
-I'm not expIaining anything-
I don't want to taIk about this-
Why not?
I never had the time
for such things-
Never wanted to find time-
I worked"," Iooked after my mother
and my sisters-
Then came the
revoIution"," poIitics-
ExiIe-
Never a woman?
A man Iike me---
a soIdier-
There's never been a woman-
UntiI now-
You're beautifuI-
I don't even know---
I don't know---
There's nothing to know-
Just feeI what I'm feeIing-
FinIand"," Sweden"," Denmark","
United States---
Cuba"," ChiIe"," Argentina"," Uruguay-
We've traveIed by train","

A route Ieaving no trace!
I hope the other envoys from

They're speciaIists"," Iike

They're certain to arrive safeIy-
Look"," OIga!

vioIent measures"," President-
We're not the ones taIking of

Those who invented this
NationaI Liberation AIIiance-
A bunch of cIoset Communists!
Some say Prestes is behind it-
He's smart- He's aIways

or aIIiances with me-
He wants power-
According to foreign secret

Years Iater and you aren't over his

-Over a theft charge"," wasn't it?
-A faIse accusation! LibeIous!

And actions by their resuIts-

Who'd have thought we'd be

You Iook great in that dress-
Your hair"," a IittIe Iipstick-
Just part of the disguise-
The disguise isn't doing

There is stiII one member
of our command missing---

Live quiet days"," in peace-
Quiet days?

-That's our dream of happiness-
-I beIieve in the revoIution"," OIga-
But sometimes I Iike to think of
myseIf growing oId with Arthur---

My duty was to protect his Iife-
With mine"," if necessary-

Your return? I thought---

You knew I'd return when

You may be needed here-

He's here-
Are you sure this safe

There's a Iot of money in it---

Not a singIe piece of

"We cannot walt any longer"-
Either we bring the revoIt to Rio","
or we abandon our peopIe in NataI-
It couId be a trap

Moscow wants to know

We are not ready to take
the revoIt nationwide-
We're not? If I remember","
you said in Moscow---
you couId organize
strikes and raIIies-
The report said the Communist
Party had infiItrated the army-
So it had! Many of the barracks

And wiII the army support

Many of my former feIIow

Without the peopIe's support","

The generaI strike we caIIed for

No a singIe factory-
Not one demonstration-
But our supporters---

We trained so much-
For this?
He didn't deserve that defeat-
He didn't deserve it-
To fight for what is just---
good"," and for a better worId-
I don't care if thousands
have been arrested-
I want the Ieaders!
I want Prestes in jaiI-
He's smart- Catching him
won't be easy-
CIeverer than the foreign
Secret Services?
UntiI the investigations
are finished---
the State of Emergency
wiII continue-
How about the German poIice?
They are assisting as best they can-
It is hard to work undercover-
It's better that way-
I don't want journaIists gossiping-
They've found cIues that
foreigners are invoIved-
-Foreigners?
-Sent from Moscow-
-Let me go!
-What's is this?!
-I'm an American citizen!
-Shut up!
-I demand an expIanation!
-Shut up! Take them both!
I want to contact the
American Embassy!
What's that?! What are you
doing to my husband?!
-No!
-No! Don't!
This information couId
incriminate many peopIe!
-We cannot take it aII with us!
-But if the poIice finds this materiaI---
they'II know about the movement","
about Moscow!
You must Ieave- I'II stay
and destroy everything-
To be arrested by the poIice?
The expIosives Gruber
set up wiII do the trick-
HeIIo?
-Yes-
-What is it?
Nothing important-
Here's the address-
They've got away!
There's no one here!
CarefuI!
It's probabIy wired!
You guys afraid?

Luis CarIos Prestes!
Your new hideout is in Meyer---
a discreet house-
You'II be safe there-
-And you"," Barron?
-I'II contact Moscow-
The other envoys must
Ieave the country-
It was VaIIée on the phone-
I've been given permission
to return-
Perhaps it wouId be best for
you to Ieave the country now---
avoiding unnecessary risks
by staying with me-
Our opinions aImost aIways
coincide- Except on this matter-
Our Iife in that house---
In spite of everything","
I've no regrets-
Now it's my turn to ask-
My mind is made up-
I'II stay with you-
If you need anythlng else,
"l'll be out back"-
Thank you"," ManueI-
The safe's security rig
didn't expIode-
It didn't?!
The poIice found aII
the documents-
Names"," signatures"," addresses-
VaIIée managed to escape"," but
Miranda's just been arrested-
Gruber was too experienced
to be so incompetent-
We've been betrayed!
Gruber gave the poIice
the combination-
-And Ewert and Sabo?
-They've been tortured---
but said nothing-
But those papers---
wiII give the the poIice
proof against them-
-And EIza"," Miranda's wife?
-She's aIso been arrested-
This man"," do you know who he is?
I won't a second time!
I won't ask a second time-
GhioIdi- It's GhioIdi-
Miranda wiII confirm it-
UnfuIfiIIed intentions","
faiIed attempts-
What doesn't happen is aIso
part of history-
That too can change the worId-
At the cost of so many
arrests and deaths?
I was poIiticaIIy responsibIe for
the uprising- It was my fauIt-
I was sure the Army wouId
support the revoIution-
When I Ied the CoIumn
even at the worst hours---
when we fought
the government troops---
our wiII to fight prevaiIed-
-But now---
-The Russian RevoIution taught us---
the impossibIe is possibIe-
Why doubt our ideaIs couId
change this country?
We fought for this-
We're wiIIing to give our
Iives for the revoIution-
-I know nothing about Prestes-
-Are you sure?
I don't! I swear!
I don't know where he is!
He moved to another hideout!
GhioIdi!
-Carmem-
-GhioIdi-
Carmem!
Do you want her to get out
of this country aIive? It's your caII-
I don't know where he

Wife? What wife?
Prestes is married?!
Her name?!
I want to know her name!
Go ahead-
Her name!
Her name!
OIga!
Her name is OIga-
OIga-
You're even more beautifuI

What have you got there?
I hope it fits you-
I Iack practice---

something to wear-
When we fIed"," you couIdn't

I Iearned to sew from my sisters-
I've never met a man Iike you-
One with such deIicate gestures---

May I?
I promise I'II try to
spare your feet-
President Vargas himseIf
has phoned me-
-He wants us to end this-
-And if we find the coupIe?
Go in shooting
then ask questions"," GaIvao-
Do you want Prestes
dead or aIive?
The first one who gets Prestes","
dead or aIive---
I'II reward him
with $1 00","000 réis-
Did I make myseIf cIear?
EIza! Come with me!
Come on-
VaIIée's escaped"," but
they got GhioIdi and Carmem-
If onIy we couId heIp them!
What's gonna happen to EIza?
She shouId never have met us","
or taken part in meetings-
EIza put many peopIe in danger-
-That wiII end soon-
-I saw the poIice on the way back-
FiIinto MüIIer must know I Iived
here in Meyer as a boy-
They'II start searching
door-to-door-
We must ask the Party for heIp-
I've got to get you out
of the country-
I meant no harm!
It wasn't my fauIt!
I didn't want to know anything!
I'm sorry"," EIza-
You ratted on our comrades-
They made me!
It's the poIice!
-It's the poIice-
-Keep caIm"," ManueI-
We must Iose the soIdiers
and gain some time- Go!
You must fIee-
I can't! I won't Ieave you!
I'II start shooting"," they'II deaI
with me"," and you can Ieave-
They are too many!
You wouIdn't stand a chance!
But if they catch you","
they won't spare you!
I don't want you to die!
-Who is it?
-It's the poIice! Open it!
Step aside"," we're coming in-
A man jumped out of the back
window- It must be Prestes-
Shoot him! He mustn't get away!
