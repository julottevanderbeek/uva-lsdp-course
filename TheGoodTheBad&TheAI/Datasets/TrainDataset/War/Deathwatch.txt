Come on, come on Chevasse
CorporaI
Oh, God. It hurts
Put your hand here
Yes, sir
How is he?
I think he's cut his spine
The chances are that it'II turn gangrenous
and er, I'm aImost out of morphine
I couId read to him
Yes, why don't you because that'II heIp
What'II we do, sir?
Stay here. HoId the trench
Sir, if I don't get him back
to our support trench, he wiII die
I know
Thank you, CorporaI
Yes, sir
Okay, Iisten
We've captured a forward, German trench
It's a rare achievement, gentIemen
It may be vitaI to the war effort
We wiII hoId this trench untiI
we are reinforced. We must...
...that is our duty
Get some scoff on, get a brew going...
See if we can't make the best of it, eh?
Make the best of it?
He makes it sound Iike a bIoody hoIiday
I went to BIackpooI once
Yeah?
Nice?
I kiIIed a man there. Yeah, it was nice
How oId are you, son?
Nineteen Sarge
Don't fuck me about. How oId are you?

And a haIf
BIoody heII. So you Iied

Yeah?
Is this what you wanted? Eh?
Go and sit over there
Come and sit down here
Och, don't worry about it.
He didn't beIieve I was nineteen either
We're not secure, sir
WeII the men are exhausted,
they need a rest
This is a German dug out
It'II be dark soon. We're not secure, sir
Yes, of course, you're right, sergeant
Right, Iet's secure the trench
Sergeant, if you wouId
Yeah
Right Quinn, Starinski, Hawkestone,
McNess, Shakespeare -
we're gonna secure this trench
Oh bIoody heII, Sarge
Doc, if you can take Chevasse up there,
under that cover
Make him as comfortabIe as possibIe
Sarge
What about him?
I don't want him watching my back
Shakespeare's coming
Right, Iadies. Move out!
Y Company on me, anything to report?
It's Iike a maze, Sarge
There's no front Iine or nothing
What's the fuckin' point of that?
Maybe they forgot where the war was
FeeIs Iike the war was in here
Right Iads, Iisten up.
If we're going to hoId this trench
we need to make it
a smaIIer area to defend
We'II set charges here,
here and twenty yards down there,
on the right
That'II bring down
this section of the dugout
After that, we rest
Come on, move it!
Who's going to be hiding here?
WeII, that German and his paIs for one
HeIp me
It's just pure Iuck you made it this far,
isn't it, Shakespeare?
We've wired up the detonator right,
haven't we?
If you've got it wrong
you'II bIow us aII to heII
Don't you trust me, huh?
WeII, that's a good sign
AIright, heads down
Why isn't...
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?
Aye
Good work Iads
What bIoody good is that?
OnIy haIf as much to defend now,
isn't there?
CorporaI!
Sir!
How Iong wouId you say
we were waIking back there in the fog?
CoupIe of hours, maybe?
ReaIIy?
Why?
WeII I...
Sir
Bradford,
It's one of these new crystaI radio units,
sir. We've got then in command
But can we raise HQ with it?
I don't know, I can try
There's so many dead
That German's gonna be
a miIIion miIes from here
There's pIenty of rats, though
That's a German bayonet
Were they fighting each other?
Hun sticking Hun
Jesus, what happened here? Look at this
But why?
Maybe gas
Gas can make you do funny things
What do you think McNess?
I think, if they keep this up,
we won't have to do any fighting ourseIves
Oi!
Woah, cIose one!
What is it?
It's a buIIet
I'd hang on to that. Might be Iucky
Lucky it didn't bIow his baIIs off!
Right!
Nobody rests untiI we secure every inch
of this trench. AIright?!
Sarge
Now, on me
Shakespeare. Take this morphine.
Make sure Doc gets it for Chevasse
Yes sir
Don't caII me sir, Iad. I'm a sergeant.

Bradford?
Come and have a pew by the fire.
Let me have a Iook at that Ieg
Any Iuck with the radio?
Er, not yet
The chances of getting a signaI are pretty sIim
More IikeIy to end up taIking to the Hun
WeII, that's not a bad thing
At Ieast they might be abIe to teII us where we a
Doesn't the Captain know?
Doubt it
I think he'd rather be tucked up
in Sandhurst, poIishing his boots
You served with him before?
No, no. He was posted to us
when our Iast CO was hit
He seems decent enough
He seems Iike a man out of his depth,
if you ask me
At Ieast we've stiII got Tate
Chevasse is gonna die, isn't he?
Yeah
I shipped over with him
He said he had a fiance in Norwich
What?
WeII you heard the joke?
What joke?
GirI in Norwich
I don't get it
Knickers. Off. Ready
When. I. Come. Home.
Norwich, you see. It's a joke
Oh
You haven't heard it?
No
Right. You've dressed this weII
Yeah, practice makes perfect
I'm onIy twenty,
I've aIready been shot four times
Your friend up there must Iike you
Not exactIy spreading it
around much though is he?
God has Iove for us aII
You just have to open your heart
I don't think God is anywhere
near this pIace
He brought us here, didn't he?
Out of the battIe, out of the gas.
We were bIessed
BIessed? ReaIIy.
What about Chevasse, is he bIessed?
God works in mysterious ways
And there are better pIaces than here
Fuckin' Sergeant needs anything doing,
it's aIways McNess
McNess, you kiIIed the president,
McNess on point
What about Starinski?
It's never fuckin' Quinn
What about Hawkestone? No
Fuckin' me
I know what it is
It's a Scottish thing.
He doesn't Iike Scots, that's what it is
Maybe it's because he trusts you
Aye. WeII, there's that as weII
Trust me on this, right?
We shouIdn't be here
Fuckin' dead bodies everywhere
Why? Why haven't they come back
for the trench?
Why haven't they come back for the men?
Ah? Why haven't they come back for you?
We shouIdn't be here
Do you think our men
wiII come back for us?
Stay aIert. Stay awake
Right, that says prison to me
Get in there
In there
Aye, why not?
Get in there
Get in
Or I'II fuckin' shoot ya
Get in!
Shoot him!
Go on, shoot him
Why?

Why kiII him.
What good's that going to do anyone?
He's scared
Fuckin' shouId be
Come on, what eIse you gonna do?
Get in

There. Quinn, Hawkestone down there.
Shakespeare with me
Starinski!
You try up there, I'm going down here
Sergeant
Sergeant,...
I've found Starinski
There's more Germans here
We're gonna have to find them
Ich wiII fort von hier
EngIish!
Speak any French, Captain?
I can
...the other...ou est I'autre?
What's French for German?
Shut up! I'm not askin' you
I was a Iiaison with the French Command
before coming to the front
I can speak French
WeII you'd better do the transIating then
Sir
Go on son Sir
Yeah, you're not proposing fucking
marriage. Just find out where his mate is
What's he saying?
He said...weII, sir, it's very hard...
What's he saying?
He said...Iook , I,
I think he said we're aII going to die
It's his Kraut chum who's gonna die
He said something
about turning on each other
I'm going to wrap barbed wire around him
and squeeze him untiI he's nothing
but IittIe pieces
He said none of us wiII survive
TeII him that we know
his friend murdered one of my men
...and when we find him
we're gonna kiII him. TeII him that
He said they're not the enemy. He said...
...there's something wrong
with this pIace, with this trench...
Look he said it's in the earth,
in the ground...
In the ground
They must be using tunneIs to get about
It kiIIed aII of them, it's gonna
kiII us too. He says we shouId Ieave
MaI. What's that, what's that word?
EviI. It means eviI
This is Y Company,
and we're stiII aIive...
Is anybody there? Anybody?
This is Y Company, and we're stiII aIive
No. No. No, we are aIive!
We are stiII aIive
Bradford
Chevasse
Who's there?
Who are you?
Who are you?
These Bosch are worse dead than aIive
So what's the point of this?
It's easy to hide in the bodies isn't it
Put them aII in one pIace,
and there's one Iess pIace to hide
That's the Iast of them
Those we can move anyway
So much death
Beggars the imagination
Perhaps you'd Iike to say
a few words, Bradford
The Captain's saying he wants
to hear something from your book
Very weII
And the four angeIs were Ioosed...
...which were prepared for an hour,
and a day,
and a month, and a year
For they were to sIay
the third part of men...
...by the fire, by the smoke
and by the brimstone
...which rained down about their heads
We have aII made a covenant with death...
...and with heII we are in agreement
Who do you think you are,
the Archbishop of fuckin' Canterbury?
Ignore him.
You send one up there for me, aye
When the over fIown scourge
shaII pass through...
...you shaII be trodden down by it
Are these better than ours?
WeII if you're Iooking for a nice Iine
in shrapneI wounds and severed Iimbs. Yeah
ProbabIy a IittIe better
Mind you I hear our pineappIes
make a pretty good fruit saIad
Why are we doing this?
Ah, weII...sometimes it's just better
to be doing something
We know the enemy's stiII here
somewhere, so...
Captain teIIs us we have to stay
and hoId the trench, so...
...we stay and hoId the trench. That's the
chain of command, we do what we're toId
And what then?
AII of us at risk to hoId this pIace,
and we, we don't even know where it is
Or what it is
Right, we've got underground saps
aII aIong here, yeah?
Some of them have got tunneIs
There, there and down there
So we just chuck grenades in
and coIIapse the entrances?
Yeah, that's about the sum of it
Do you think it wiII work, Sarge?
Why not?
Oh, come on.
There's a bad feeIing here. This trench
What you taIking about?
Sarge, something isn't right...
What?
Nothing
Right, with a bit of Iuck the whoIe thing
wiII cave in and trap him down there
Aye, or drive them out into the open
Yeah, either way we've got a resuIt.
AIright?
Aye
Bradford!
Bradford!
TeII Jennings one minute. Go on. Go!
We're ready, sir
One minute
Very good. TeII him to proceed

Cap...
Oh, Jesus Christ
Captain made his buIIet count, Sarge
Oh Jesus...
No, no! No,
what's the matter with this pIace?
Where's...where's the army?
Got any words for us now, Archbishop?
Sergeant Tate,
are we spending another night here?
Is that a good idea?
It's up to the Captain
But what wouId you do?
Stay here?
There's something wrong
with this pIace, isn't there?
Something not right
Look what the Captain did
What happened to Starinski?
I don't know what you're taIking about
But the...
You heard it
I heard nothing
WeII what about the noise?
I heard nothing
What did you hear, eh?
You
You
But the prisoner. What he said.
He said we'd turn on each other
What are we gonna do.
I mean we can't just...
Shut up!
Just...just shut up with your questions
He's the Captain, not me
Ask him
Shakespeare, Shakespeare
Come here
We shouId Ieave right now
Two men dead. Do you want
to add to that, Shakespeare, huh?
Do ya?
The Captain says we hoId this trench.
So we're gonna sit tight
You're gonna sit tight
You understand?
LittIe Hun bastards
What have you been doin' here, eh?
Jesus Christ, Bradford
This pIace is scary enough
without you jumping out at me
Are you aIright?
Good
You take over, I'm gonna get some kip
Right Bradford, I'm here
Bradford?
WeII that's just fuckin' great
Have you come for me, have you?
Come on then
Is this my time, huh?

You're gonna fuckin' need it
No!
What the fuck happened to you,
you stupid Scottish bastard?
You aIright, McNess?
Come on, Iet me have a Iook
Wait!
McNess, what are you doing?
Leaving!
WeII that's the best idea
I've heard aII day
McNess, you can't Ieave. You know that
Look we'II dig in.
BuiId a strong defensive position
Defensive position? What are we
defending against Sergeant, huh? What?
Come on say it. EviI!
WiII you Iisten to yourseIf. EviI!
It's the gas,
we are haIIucinating, that is aII
Was Starinski haIIucinating, huh?
Is this a fuckin' haIIucination?
There must be another sniper
Germans we haven't found yet
I don't know
Aye I know you don't know.
You don't know because you won't admit it
Fucking none of you
I don't...I don't wanna die
I'm not waiting to die
Mcness, pIease don't go out there
There's nothing out there. It's in here
It's in fuckin' here
Where do you think you're going?
Deserters wiII be shot
What wouId your father say
if he saw you now?
He'd say naughty boy
'Naughty boy' pointing weapons at peopIe
I'II put you over my knee and
I'II give you a damn good thrashing
That's what he'd say
Give me the gun Captain
Give me the gun
Remember your fuckin' manners
Remember your fuckin' manners
Don't forget your fuckin' manners
You are under arrest
Mcness!
I don't see him
Right, hoId on
Got him

What?
What is it?
It's death!
And it's waiting for us
AII this bIame, this hatred...
Come on, Bradford. Come back with me
It's in the earth, and the rats,
and the fIies, and you and me
We're dead, CharIey. I know that now
I can't feeI my heart beating anymore
I died here, and I just didn't reaIise it
Come on. Come back with me
No. You have to stop me
I'm not a murderer
You wiII be
I was wrong, you see. God is dead
We're aII aIone
Bradford
Bradford! Where are we?
Tate, barricades won't work.
It didn't heIp the Germans
That thing out there took McNess
Right in front of my eyes,
sucked him into the fuckin' mud
So what are we gonna do.
Hide round some boxes?
Captain
Captain we need a hand here
HaIt! Who's there?
It's me!
It's me
Shakespeare, where the heII have you been?
Come give us a hand, wiII ya?
Sarge
Bradford shot McNess
I saw him do it
He shot his own man
That's not gonna do us any good, Sergeant
Not against what's in here
I'm a soIdier, son. I fight
what I can see. What's in front of me
But it's not in front of us.
Don't you understand that yet?
Look, you're not Iistening
You're meant to be in charge
Just Iisten to him
Oi! Hun! Hun!
You wanna kiII me?
WeII come on then
Come on, come on then!
I'm waiting
Where do you think you're going?
I can't Iet Quinn kiII the prisoner
You mad?

But he's not the enemy
Look we can't Iet this go on,

Do you think you deserve to be saved?
I think so
Oh, thank God. CharIey, where's Tate?
