Oscar Papa One,
Oscar X-ray. Over.
Oscar Papa One,
how copy? Over.
Do you have movement
at this time? Over.
They're sleeping.
They've got
to be sleeping.
Unless their radio's broke.
Oscar Papa One,
Oscar X-ray. Come on, come on.
Somebody, talk to me.
You jerks sleeping or what?
All right, Johnson,
you call the C.O.
You tell him what's
going on here.
I'm gonna wake
those boys up.
It's nothing, Mickey.
Bravo, bravo,
Oscar X-ray. Over.
Bravo, bravo,
Oscar X-ray. Over.
Come on, Peterson--
Drop down, Mickey!
Get in the hole!
Down! Down! Back, back, back!
Come on!
Get moving.
Hurry up, Mickey! Come on!
Aah!
Incoming!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Coming in, coming in!
It's Zeke!
Give him cover fire!
Come on, Zeke!
Come on!
Move it, Johnson!
You okay, Zeke?
Keep firing at the tree line!
Mickey!
God, where's Mickey?
Lieutenant, call
the weapons platoon leader.
What position?
Tell them to mix it with H.E.
Oscar Papa,
Oscar Papa, we--
Medic! Medic!
Oh...
Hang in there, lieutenant.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there!
Come on.
You're going to be okay.
I already called for tact-air!
We've got zips on the wire now!
Where in the bloody hell
are you?
We need napalm
on the tree line!
Where? Where?
Right there--
Napalm at 767-935,
southeast side.
Napalm now!
I need napalm now!
Come on,
let's get that one!
Mickey!
You guys seen Mickey?
Oh, God.
Mickey.
You got Mickey?
Come on, Johnson,
man, come on!
He's gone, man.
We lost him. Come on.
Mickey!
Come on, Johnson, man.
Let it go, brother.
Let it go, man.
Come on,
forget about it.
He was my best friend!
Come on, come on.
Get up out of there. Come on.
Come on, man.
Get him out of here!
Johnson,
let it go, man.
Let it go, man.
Come on! Let it go.
He was a good man.
They were all good men.
It shouldn't have happened.
It's supposed to be
getting easier.
We're supposed to be
winning this war.
Oh, yeah?
I'll tell you
something, captain.
We came about that far
from getting overrun.
I know.
Come on, Zeke, I want you
to take a walk with me.
There's something
I want to show you.
You were out there
among them, Zeke.
They all
look like this?
What, are you talking about
the uniform?
Yeah.
Yep. Every last
one of them.
They ain't your typical
rice paddy daddies either.
Nope. We've got something
altogether new here--
North Vietnamese
Army regulars.
First time I've ever heard
of them being this far south.
Yeah.
We've got a whole new war
ahead of us, Zeke.
Hey, I've got a job
for you to do.
I want you to police up
these bodies.
Battalion wants
maps, papers,
any identifying
material we can find.
Then I want you to hop
the first chopper
over to division
headquarters.
Major Braun's going to be
very interested in this.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir,
but while I'm over there,
maybe I could do
a little recruiting
for you and the First Sergeant.
Good idea, Zeke.
I was hoping you'd say that.
By the way, you did
a good job last night.
Hell, I'm alive.
Can't do any better
than that.
Hey, partner.
Yeah?
I'm already dying.
Don't kill me no more.
Oh. I'm just learning.
Yeah? Well...
don't quit
your day job.
Open it up!
Open it up! Open it up!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move 'em on in!
Magnificent weapon.
I wish we had some of these.
You were in the L.P.,
and you say there was
at least a battalion?
No, sir. I didn't say
anything like that.
I said I saw enough of them
to make me run like hell,
but there must have been a lot
to do what they did to us.
The amazing thing is that
they're this far south.
They're a lot stronger
than we thought.
What we need
is more information.
It's a shame you didn't
take prisoners.
Yes. It's imperative
that we get a prisoner.
Tell your C.O.
if there's
any further contact,
to try to get
one of them alive.
Yes, sir.
But speaking for myself,
my number one priority
is keeping me alive
I don't worry
about their lives.
I hear you, sergeant.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes. Dismissed.
DJ: Coming to you
from Armed Services Radio,
we bring you
the best rock in Vietnam.
Here's a special dedication
to you FNGs in "I" corps.
Welcome to 'Nam, boys.
Mad dog!
Jungle rules volleyball.
Why aren't you playing?
Hey, Zeke Anderson.
How are you?
Alive and well,
and bearing gifts too.
I've got this here...
a genuine North Vietnamese
army belt, size 28.
Now, they're skinny
little fellas,
but you put a couple
notches in it,
it'll fit you.
Zeke, this thing is great!
I'm telling you.
What can I do for you?
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you asked me that,
because I've come to do
a little recruiting here.
There they are.
Take your pick.
All cherries.
Just got back
from combat orientation.
Yeah? I like that.
All right,
who's winning over here?
We are,
nine to three.
Winners,
line up on the grass over there!
Who's winning over there?
We are, 10 to 1.
line up over here too!
On the grass.
Come on, move it!
All right,
all of you who are bleeding,
take a step back.
I don't want any bleeders.
I cannot stand
the sight of blood.
Not you, son.
Those are
skinned knuckles.
Skinned knuckles
are okay.
All right, in case
you haven't figured it out yet,
I'm looking for
winners, survivors.
Because that's what I am,
I'm a survivor.
I'm very good at it.
But it also helps if you have
a certain amount
of natural ability.
Anybody want to get high? Huh?
I've got beaucoup,
Vietnamese dope. Good dope.
Nobody?
Nobody?
That's good.
I do not want any dopers.
I do not want any dopers.
If you're smoking dope
and getting high,
you're not listening to me.
You don't listen to me,
you're gonna get me killed,
and that's not going to happen.
What about dummies?
Got any low-IQ types?
If we do, take
a giant step back,
mother may I.
What is your name,
soldier?
Lawrence.
Clyde R. Lawrence.
Clyde R. Lawrence, where
are you from Clyde R. Lawrence?
Motown!
Is that in the USA?
Motown? That's in Detroit!
Are you a survivor, Lawrence?
Damn straight.
I'm glad to hear that.
Step on out here.
Line up over here.
I'd be proud to serve
with you, sergeant.
No, you wouldn't, son.
No, you wouldn't.
What's your name?
Corporal Daniel Percell.
Corporal Daniel Percell.
How come
they made you corporal?
I had ROTC in high school,
I imagine that's why.
Did you volunteer for Vietnam,
Corporal Daniel Percell?
That's right. I did, sergeant.
You volunteered?
That's right.
Why didn't you step out
with the other dummies
when I said to?
I don't think patriotism
is something
to laugh about, sergeant.
Oh, son, when it gets you
into the fine mess
you're into now,
it is something
to laugh about.
But it's all right now.
It's all right.
You just step out,
you join us right over there
in the line over there.
Um...you mind if I ask you
a personal question?
How did you get
to be so damned big?
Well, I guess because
I eat a balanced diet--
you know, plenty of protein,
lots of fresh milk
and fish,
and granola,
but only the type
with nuts and raisins
and I exercise regularly--
Are you from California?
Yeah, Anaheim!
You know where
Disneyland is?
Yeah, I know.
Step out, Mr. Goofy.
Now...
where did you come from?
You called
for winners, right?
Yes, I did.
What is your M.O.S., soldier?
Machine gun, and I'm good.
Yeah. You're good.
You're good at paper targets.
Wait till you try
something that bleeds.
Hmph. My man,
I'm from the Bronx.
Blood is nothing new
to Alberto Ruiz.
Well, now, this is something
I'm gonna have to see
for my own self.
Come on.
Vaya.
Vaya.
All right, the rest of you guys,
you're winners.
You've just volunteered
for Bravo company, third herd.
The rest of you guys,
you losers,
why don't you just, uh...
why don't you just
play with each other?
ALL: Nyah! Get away!
All right,
you men are in my platoon.
Pack your trash.
We leave at 1400 hours.
Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!
I felt bad about
being rear echelon.
I used to envy guys like you.
Frontline guys.
Not anymore.
This war's getting crazy.
Listen.
That's "Digger's blues,"
and that ain't
bad either.
That is good.
I'm telling you,
that is first rate.
Hey, thanks.
Where did you learn
how to play like that?
Well, I'm from Chicago.
A lot of blues in Chicago.
Oh, yeah, yeah. yeah.
Junior Wells,
Paul Butterfield.
Paul Butterfield's
a friend of mine.
No.
Yeah.
Him and Barry Goldberg,
and Al Cooper too.
Those guys are the greatest!
I can't even find
"C" chord half the time.
I could show you.
It's not that hard.
Yeah?
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to put you
in Bravo company.
You're going to be
in my platoon.
Hang on a minute, Zeke.
You don't want this guy.
Says he won't fight.
He's a war protester.
Won't fight?
That's right.
Tell him that crap
you were telling me.
Oh, about the war?
It's an unjust war.
I mean, America's propping up
a corrupt dictatorship.
I won't fight for that.
I'll tell you what.
You will fight.
You're also going to teach me
how to play that harmonica.
We leave at 1400 hours.
Pack your stuff.
All right.
Let's load 'em up!
Move it. Move it. Move it.
Come on, move, move, move,
move. move.
All right, any of you men
know which one of these officers
is 2nd Lieutenant Goldman?
Yeah. I'm Lieutenant Goldman.
I'm your platoon sergeant--
I'm Anderson.
Well, where's
your salute, sergeant?
All right, let's load
these men up, sergeant.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's load them up!
Welcome
to Bravo company... sir.
Hey.
You scared?
Just sort
of looking out.
Me too.
Hey.
Thanks.
Hey, sergeant, how can you tell
if they're Vietcong or not?
Just pull them over and ask them
for their driver's license.
VC! VC!
Where are they?
What the hell?
You think you're
real funny?
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just an initiation.
They do it to everybody.
Sorry, sir.
No more of that!
You can ride up
in the jeep if you want.
I'll ride back here
with the men, sergeant.
Are you a West Pointer,
lieutenant?
No. Officer
Candidate School.
Another butter bar.
Hey! I said,
knock it off!
How long you been
in Vietnam?
I'm four months
into my third tour.
Your third tour?
Yeah. Maybe I'm
a little crazy, huh?
Yeah.
Try this on for size.
All right, ladies!
This is it! Welcome home!
Follow me!
We'll get you bunked down!
Right this way!
Come on, come on.
Move it, move it, move it!
Lieutenant,
the C.O.'s bunker is there.
He'll want to talk to you.
Thank you, sergeant.
Come on out, come on out!
Excuse me, sir?
Yes?
Lieutenant Goldman
reporting for duty.
I'm Rusty Wallace.
At ease.
Did you have
a good trip out?
Yes, sir. Fast.
Where you from, Myron?
New York. Queens, sir.
New York? You don't
sound like it.
Thank you, sir.
Don't mention it.
You know, there was a colonel
in World War II,
a famous colonel, Goldman.
Yes, sir.
Probably my father.
Martin Goldman.
He won the Congressional
Medal of Honor
at the Battle of the Bulge.
That's a hard act
to follow.
Yes, sir.
You know, I had
a famous father too.
He was a baseball player...
so I played football.
Well, I, uh...
plan on following
my father's tradition,
hopefully surpassing him
in some ways.
You're going to be going
into battle tomorrow, Myron.
We're going after the same batch
that hit us the other night.
Yes, sir.
I don't like to send
a new lieutenant out,
but I don't have
too much choice.
I'm going to give you
the same advice
that I give
all new lieutenants.
Rely on your sergeant's
experience.
The men know him
and trust him.
Is my Sergeant Anderson, sir?
That's right.
You have a problem
with that, Myron?
No, sir.
Uh...
the sergeant just has
an odd sense of...
uh...
He's a good man.
Give him a chance.
Yes, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes.
Dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
Is this tent six?
This be the place.
Come on in.
Is this rack taken?
It was.
Was?
It was Mickey's.
He went home yesterday.
In a plastic bag.
One of the rare
good white boys gone.
What about that one?
That was Williams.
They couldn't find
all his parts to put in a bag.
Wow, man.
I'm going to sleep
on the damn floor.
It don't
bother me none.
Ain't nobody going to kill
Clyde Lawrence.
What's the matter?
You niggers never seen
a spic before?
Not a ugly one like you
we ain't.
You got a problem,
my man?
Incoming! Incoming!
That's Mr. Charles.
Let's do it.
Where are we
supposed to go?
Get out of here!
This happen very often?
Standard operating
procedure.
Happens most every night,
cherry boy.
They fire at us.
We fire at them.
It's like sex
to those artillery guys.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be over
in a few minutes.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Let me out.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Hold it!
Stay in the bunker!
It's over there!
What?
A rat.
I hate rats!
No, no, no!
Don't go out there!
Oh, God! Let me out!
God, let me out!
Calm down. Calm down.
Rats ain't
no big thing, man.
I hate rats!
All right.
Where is he?
Over there.
All right,
right over there?
Yeah.
All right, guys.
Let's get him.
Take that, you commie rat.
Company, fall in!
Bravo company,
ready, sir.
Charlie company
ready, sir!
Stand at ease!
Men, we lost a lot
of good friends the other night.
Now we have a chance
to get even.
We have reports of a large body
of NVA regular troops
in the vicinity.
Now, they've never been seen
this far south before,
but we're going to stop them.
Here and now.
Bravo and Charlie companies
are going to play bait.
We'll go out, make contact,
and when we do,
brigade is going to come down
hard and heavy--
classic sparrow and hawk.
Squad leaders!
Check your men!
I don't believe it. Bait.
They're using my life
to go fishing with.
This is what
it's all about-- war.
Percell, now, you're going
to have to tape
these dog tags together,
otherwise, you're going
to sound
like Chinese wind chimes
out there.
These paid for, Taylor?
Hey, sergeant,
I just want you to know
that I haven't changed
my thinking.
I'm not fighting.
All right, now.
Listen up, Horn,
because I'm not
messing with you today.
This ain't a protest march
we're going on here.
You understand me?
Our lives are
on the line here.
We're all gonna depend
on each other.
All right, Percell,
get up here with that radio!
You're gonna be R.T.O.
I'm keeping you real close
to me and the lieutenant.
Let's go.
Let's load them up!
Go!
Lock and load!
Okay.
Let's do it.
We're going in hot!
All right, gentlemen,
by the numbers!
Go! Go! Go!
Let's go!
Move it, Horn.
Medic! Medic!
They're leaving us!
They're leaving us!
Come on!
God. Shoot.
Kill them! Kill them!
Medic!
Come on, Lawrence!
Keep moving!
Medic!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Stay down, lieutenant. Down!
Move out! Move it!
Stay down! Stay down!
Move out! Move it!
Get down. Look out.
Sergeant, get these moving--
Get down!
Keep your butt down,
lieutenant.
Call in artillery.
Let them do it.
I'm in command here,
sergeant.
Now, we're taking
that tree line!
Now, follow my orders!
No, lieutenant,
I'm not dying,
neither are these
men aren't dying. Horn!
Get me that radio!
Hang in there.
Hang in there.
Red Leg.
This is Bravo Two.
Fire mission
from Whiskey Delta
add 1-0-0 Mike.
Gooks in the tree line.
Artillery fire. Over.
RADIO:
We're on the way.
First round is smoke.
There it is, sarge.
All right.
Red Leg, Bravo Two.
Drop 1-0-0.
Fire for effect. Over.
Roger, Bravo Two. We copy.
See there, lieutenant?
All you've got to do
is let Arty do the work.
Nobody gets hurt
that way.
You keep up
your fire, Baker!
Keep moving, men.
Come on, Taylor, fire!
Fire!
Where's your weapon,
soldier?
I left it
on the chopper.
You what?
I am not fighting, sir.
You're both going
to get court-martialed
when we get back--
the both of you.
Horn...
you are incredible.
You're just incredible.
How could anybody
survive this?
You'd be surprised.
You'd be surprised.
Man, this is spooky.
No bodies, no nothing.
They move their dead.
They don't
leave nothing.
Blood trail!
I got a blood trail here.
It goes up that way.
All right,
we'll follow that trail.
Keep your eyes open, now.
They're gonna be looking for us.
Lieutenant, call six
and tell them what we're doing.
We've got to figure out a place
to meet the rest of the company.
You seem to be making a lot
of decisions here, sergeant.
I'm just trying to help,
lieutenant.
Bravo Six, this is
Bravo Two. Over.
This is Bravo Six.
Come in, Bravo Two.
Bravo Six,
this is Bravo Two.
We're about one click
northwest of the LZ.
We've got
a blood trail.
We're going to follow it
due west. Over.
Due west.
We copy. Over.
This is great.
We're supposed to be
a full company,
and we're stuck
with half a platoon.
Man, the lieutenant
has lots to learn.
He'd better learn fast,
or he's going to get himself
a bullet in his dunce cap.
Six, we've lost
the blood trail.
It completely disappeared.
We're requesting
you pick us up at the LZ. Over.
Negative. I want you
to circle around southeast.
The rest of the company
is landing at 223-472.
I say again, 223-472. Over.
Roger.
Rejoin you
at 223-472. Out.
All right, gentlemen.
We're moving out. Southeast.
We're joining
the rest of the company.
All right, let's move.
Move, move, move.
Percell, come on.
Taylor, what are you,
a tourist?
Come on. Let's do it.
Come on.
Hey, Taylor.
What?
Tell me something.
Be honest.
Be real honest, okay?
You ever kill anybody?
Where do you
come from, fool?
I just asked a question, man.
Don't ask.
I'll just get
a GTO, man,
One that's candy apple red
with four on the floor, man.
Hey, shut up.
Oh, you don't
like cars, man?
No, man. I hate cars.
I like subways.
You know what?
New York, buddy--
Hey, you watch it,
dumb and ugly.
Who are you calling
dumb and ugly?
Hey! Shut up up there.
What have you got?
A wire.
Oh, yeah.
Careful, Zeke.
C-4.
Johnson, you've got
yourself an eagle eye.
It's my tail.
Lieutenant, we've got
a C-4 block here.
The way I see it,
we can either blow it up,
in which case everybody's
going to know we're here
in the vicinity,
or we can disarm it.
Disarm it.
Okay.
God.
It reminds me
of your mama, Baker.
My mother?
Yeah, your mother.
Here she is.
Ain't she pretty?
All right, let's saddle up.
Let's go.
Keep your eyes open.
Move real slow.
Okay, Percell, you're going
to take point for a while.
Johnson, stay
right with him.
Let's go, let's go.
Watch your step, now.
What's the matter?
You don't like
lizards, Baker?
Stop it, man.
Hey, come on,
that was a boss lizard.
Ruiz, get back here.
Ruiz!
Ruiz! Ruiz,
get the hell back.
I saw two gooks, sarge.
Where?
Right there.
They went
into the bushes.
All right. Go back,
get the lieutenant.
Stay low and be quiet.
Okay.
Where are they?
Today's your lucky day,
lieutenant.
Right over the hill there.
That's got
to be the headquarters
for that bunch
we're looking for.
All right.
I'm going
to radio the C.O.
I think we're way in
over our head.
Bless your heart.
Come on, move out.
Stay low. Keep quiet.
Let's go. Move out.
Bravo Six, this is
Bravo Two. Over.
Location, Bravo Two?
Click 406-379.
We've got an enemy camp here,
NVA regulars.
Bingo!
What do you need? Over.
We want artillery.
Come on, move out.
Oh, God.
Look, sergeant.
A wire, sergeant. A wire.
Freeze, Lawrence.
Don't move.
Stay right
where you are, man.
Don't worry.
I'm all right.
I ain't going nowhere.
I think I pressed it
already, sergeant.
Help me.
I think I already
pushed it a little.
Oh, God.
I'll just stay right here.
Just stay still, Lawrence.
Just stay still.
Oh, no.
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Keep up our fire!
Come on, Horn!
Bravo six,
this is Bravo Two.
We've got about
five minutes to live here.
We've got about
five minutes to live here!
Now where the hell's
the artillery?
We cannot fire
at this time.
We have ARVN choppers
in the vicinity. Over.
Well, tell them
to get the hell out of there!
Ask about air support.
Air control!
Got any birds in RAO? Go!
Hold on.
I'm checking it out.
Oh, they hell with it, come on.
we can outrun them in the bush.
I've got a better idea.
I'll get over on their flank.
Ruiz! Johnson!
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna take them out,
I hope. Here we go.
Aah!
Medic!
I'm hit, I'm hit!
There's some of them
behind us!
Behind us, yes.
Excuse me, guy.
It hurts, man. It hurts.
You'll be all right.
Just a little flesh wound.
Fire! Lay it down!
Lay it down!
Ruiz...
lay down fire.
We're going to get the flank.
Do it!
Ready? Pins.
Go!
Go, Johnson!
Can you get them
from here?
Never miss.
You're beautiful. All right, you
see those long, narrow boxes?
That's just got to be ammo.
Come on, baby.
We've only got one of those.
This one's for Mickey.
We found them hiding
in the bunker down there.
We've got maps,
radio equipment, everything.
Real good work, men.
This is just what
division wanted.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
I think the lieutenant
should get a commendation.
Well, thank you, sir,
but here's the man
who deserves the credit.
Oh, no.
You're a fast learner.
Finally got myself
a lieutenant I like.
And I got myself
a good sergeant.
Look out!
Don't shoot.
You'll hit Horn!
Hey, are you
all right?
I killed him.
I killed him.
What you did
was you saved our lives.
That's what
you're supposed to do.
Do yourself a favor.
Next time,
use one of these.
This war's wrong.
Maybe...
but that's not the point.
