Previously on "Vikings":
Why do you not go home?
By staying you've given me time
to raise a large army.
Thorvard: Your lands are
lost, invaded by Jarl Borg.
Your family has fled
only the gods know where.
I must find my family.
If I can be of help
to king Horik
Then I'm happy to stay.
Then so be it.
Your friends will be leaving
at first light.
Ealdorman Werferth:
Their forces have divided,
Four of their ships
have sailed away.
-
- Aghhh! Ugh!
Bishop Edmund:
Here is your destiny, apostate!
King Ecbert:
Wait! Cut him down.
Jarl Borg: I'm happy that
Ragnar Lothbrok has returned.
I will kill him!
Rollo: We have no chance
at defeating Jarl Borg.
Ragnar:
Then we find more men.
Rollo: There are no more to find.
I have tried.
It has been a long time.
Hello, Ragnar.
More, give me more
give me more
if I had a heart
I could love you
if I had a voice I would sing
after the night
when I wake up
I'll see
what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
if I had a voice
I would sing
Lagertha, you're the last person
I expected to see here.
You and your warriors
are as welcome to us
As spring after the hardest
and most bitter winter.
Rollo, my son and I
are only too glad
To come to Ragnar's aid.
Freya and all the gods, Bjorn,
You're a big bastard now.
Thank you, Uncle.
Still can't grow a beard,
though.
Everything is new now.
Torstein:
Good to see you, Bjorn.
Yes...
Yes.
You stayed true to your path.
Siggy!
Floki: You see him, Helga?
He's all grown up!
Bjorn:
I missed you so much.
Floki: You look stronger
than your father.
Come, what have they been
feeding you?!
You look like
you've been eating a cow a day.
Bjorn:
You are the one to talk.
Aslaug:
I am grateful to see you.
Lagertha:
Thank you, princess Aslaug.
Bjorn:
Princess.
My sons: Ubbe and Hvitserk.
I am pleased to see you.
I always knew that, some day,
I would meet some more
of Ragnar's sons.
Ubbe:
How did you know?
And you have a baby?
May I?
Aslaug: His name is
Sigurd snake-in-the-eye.
After your father?
And after his own father.
Ragnar: Enough with the
pleasantries, let's make a plan.
Lagertha:
So?
Torstein: Even with your
additional forces, Lagertha,
We cannot attack Kattegat
and hope to succeed.
Jarl Borg is well dug in.
Lagertha:
What do you propose?
Rollo: We want to drive
Jarl Borg out of Kattegat.
He has no idea
we have been reinforced.
Torstein: And what would
make him leave Kattegat
Where he can winter in safety?
Rollo: The one thing
that would threaten
His whole existence there.
Floki:
And what would that be?
Food.
A few of us will go
into the town
And destroy the winter
grain stores.
Floki: I will do it! I will go.
Ragnar:
No. My son and I shall go.
We'll only need a few men.
Woman: Don't think
we will be long now.
Man: Seems to me the
case is quite clear.
Encompass everything else
we've discussed... Yes, yes.
King Ecbert:
Thank you.
I cannot see your face.
Young woman: I am ex-wife
of Christ: A nun.
I cannot show my face
to any man.
Well,
I am not "any man."
I am King Ecbert
And you will show me your face
Or I will be unable to judge
Whether or not
you're telling me the truth.
Who did this to you?
My husband.
He claimed
I had been unfaithful.
And were you...
Unfaithful?
no.
Hmm... What do pagans say
of such cases?
Athelstan:
If she was a free woman,
They would believe her word,
And make judgment
on her behalf.
King Ecbert: But surely her
husband has every right over her?
Surely she belongs to him,
to do with as he sees fit.
Not according to the pagans.
Then pagan laws are superior
to ours?
Not in every case, sire.
Woman, I find it unlawful
and disagreeable
That your husband should make
false claims against you.
He has provided no evidence
of your cupidity.
Therefore, I dismiss his demand
to have you branded in public.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, lord.
Oh, well, don't thank me.
Thank this pagan.
Ragnar: Olrik, Erik, sneak
through the water to the docks.
Once there,
create a... distraction,
Something that will
lead the guards away.
My son and I shall do the rest.
Guard 1:
Not long till sunrise.
Guard 2:
It's been long in coming.
Ragnar:
Don't fear death.
If it comes, embrace it
As if you're lying down
next to a beautiful woman.
Bjorn: May the fates
be kind, Olrik.
Ever since you were
eight years old,
All I heard was,
"father, father,
I want to come with you,
I'm ready.
Father, I want to fight."
Well, here we are.
Guard 1:
You're right.
Guard 2:
On the South side.
Guard 3:
Look what we have to eat.
Erik:
Now!
Guard:
Hey! Over there!
Guard 2: Take your weapons!
Go! This way!
Guard 3:
Move!
Man 3: Where are they?!
Can you see them!
Ragnar:
Erik:
split up.
Guard 1:
Stop!
Erik:
Ungh!
Erik:
guards:
Guard 1:
Now!
Olrik:
Yah! Ungh!
Aghhhhhhhhh!
Guard:
Olrik:
Guard:
Guard 1:
This way!
Bring the dogs!
Guard 2: I can't see anyone!
Get more men!
there!
bjorn: Ragnar.
Olrik:
It's me.
Bjorn: Olrik, come quick! Help.
Guard 1: Come on!
Olrik:
How bad is it?
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
Guard: Over here!
Something is over here!
Guard 2:
Do you see them?!
Bjorn:
Take it.
Guard:
Where'd they go?
Ragnar:
Watch out!
Ungh!
Guards:
Over there! There! There!
Ragnar:
Quickly!
Olrik:
bjorn: Wait! Come, come.
Guard:
The grain!
Wife: What are you
thinking of doing?
Jarl Borg: I'm thinking
of hunting down the men
who despoiled and destroyed
our winter supplies.
Wife:
This is a disgusting place.
I don't want
to be left alone here.
I am with child!
Jarl Borg:
Let's go.
men: Ho! Yah!
Man:
Go on!
Jarl Borg:
Come on.
Yah!
Agghhh!
Keep the shield-wall!
Lagertha:
Ungh! Aggghhhh!
Borg's man: Yahhhh!
Lagertha: Ungh!
Yah!
Agh!
Arrgghhh!
Yah! Ungh!
Yah!
Agghhh!
Agh!
Brace! Brace!
Be ready!
Stay on your feet!
Jarl Borg: Go!
Warriors:
Bjorn:
Agghhh! Oof!
Ragnar:
Get up! Get up!
Aghhh! Oof! Ungh!
Aghhhhh! Oof!
Rollo:
Torstein!
Agghhhh!
- Warrior: Aggghhhhhhhh!
- Rollo: Ungh!
Rollo:
I'm with you, brother!
- Rollo: Yah!
- Warrior: Agghhh! Ungh!
Yah! Ungh!
Ragnar!
Oof! Ungh!
- Jarl Borg: Retreat!
- Warrior: Follow Jarl Borg!
- Warrior: Retreat! Go!
- Shield-Maiden: Quickly!
Shield-Maiden:
Make for the horses!
Warrior:
They're running!
Jarl Borg:
Hold on!
- Jarl Borg: Go!
- Warrior: Come on!
Rollo:
You fought well today, bjorn.
Bjorn:
Thank you, Uncle.
You have a lot to learn.
Let's go.
Man 1: Ragnar Lothbrok!
He's back!
- Woman: Look!
- Man: Ragnar! He's home!
- Man:
- Woman: Come on! Come on!
Ragnar! Ragnar!
- Elisef: Floki!
- Floki: Elisef!
We are so glad to see you all.
We've been to hell and back.
Now it's time to celebrate.
Boy:
Uncle!
- How are you?
- I'm alright.
Girl:
Lagertha!
Girl 2:
She's back! We've missed you!
Man:
Lagertha!
Girl: We've missed you so much!
How was it?
Woman:
Yes, quite well!
Man: We could do some
more... Some more trade.
- Man 1: Here, will you try some?
- Man 2: They're all the same.
My lord Aethelwulf.
I heard the pagans captured you
when they raided Lindisfarne.
Is that where you're from,
Northumbria?
Athelstan:
Yes.
My father is making plans
to visit
The king of Northumbria.
Perhaps we will take you
with us.
What for?
Father Cuthbert is dead,
The monks are gone,
the monastery is burned.
What is left for me there?
Aethelwulf: Perhaps you've lost
interest in your heavenly father?
Is it true you're a pagan now?
We are christians here.
My father served at the court
of the emperor charlemagne,
The most devout of men.
If I were you,
I would not forget to attend
high mass...
That is,
if you value your soul.
Baker: Bread! No stone in this bread!
Best bread you can buy! Bread!
- Man: Fine, we'll take one.
- Woman: Introduce them!
Mary, mother of Jesus.
I just wanted to thank you.
That's...
I'm glad.
No woman should be treated
like that,
Especially not a christian.
Woman: Another one on the
way for her and her boys.
Rollo: On this day, we
offer a sacrifice to Odin,
The mighty one,
Townsfolk:
Rollo:
Release him from his bonds.
I know he will want
to die well.
Man 1:
man 2:
Kneel.
In the presence of the gods,
and in their honor,
I offer this sacrifice.
Ragnar:
Stop!
Father?
In the presence of the gods,
and in their honor,
I offer this sacrifice.
Ragnar:
I love two women.
Both of them
have given me children.
Seer: And you suppose you
must choose between them?
Ragnar:
No. I don't want to choose.
I would like
to have both of them.
Seer:
I see.
You know, of course,
the story of the marriage
Between Njord and Skadi?
Skadi was a giantess.
Her father was killed.
She strode to Askard
to get justice
And the gods asked her
if she wanted gold
For the death of her father.
"I'll settle for a husband,"
she said,
"and a bellyful of laughter."
Ragnar: This is going
to be a long story.
Seer: If you are
hundreds of years old,
Then it's a very quick story.
Ragnar:
Hmm.
Seer:
The gods conferred and agreed
That skadi could choose
a husband from among them,
But they made one condition:
That she chose him by his feet.
His feet?
Seer: Yes. And skadi
lost no time in choosing
The most shapely pair of feet,
Believing they would naturally
belong to Balder,
The most handsome of the gods.
Ragnar:
But they didn't?
Seer: No. They belonged
to the God Njord,
The lord of seafarers
and sea harvests.
His skin was old and weathered.
Ragnar:
What are you talking about?
I don't want to make a choice
between them,
But if I did,
Are you saying
that I should decide
Based on the appearance
of their feet?
Seer: Neither their
feet nor their faces.
You should examine their hearts,
their livers,
And every other organ.
In any case,
it makes no difference.
You are only fooling yourself,
Ragnar Lothbrok,
If you think the choice
is yours to make.
Bishop Edmund:
Accipite et bibite ex eo omes
Hic est enim calix
sanguinis mei...
Qui pro vobis et effundetur.
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Et pro multis in remissionem
peccatorum...
Me sterium fide.
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Bishop Edmund:
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Corpus christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Corpus christi.
Sanguinis christi.
Woman: Quickly! Quickly!
Man: Come along!
- Bjorn: Oh!
- Hvitserk: I got you!
Bjorn:
Agh!
You have to be stronger
than that!
Hvitserk, when you grow bigger,
I'll teach you to hunt.
Ubbe! Whoa!
Ragnar: It is good to see
them playing together.
Bjorn:
Agh! You have to pull!
- Aslaug: For you.
- Ragnar: Mmm...
They are all my children.
Bjorn:
What are you boys doing?
Bjorn:
There! You have it!
I am going to bear you
another son.
I know.
Bjorn:
What are you doing, huh?
But I am fearful
of the prophecy.
Hvitserk:
Caught you there!
What are you going to do
about Lagertha?
What do you mean
what am I going to do?
Bjorn: Stronger than this!
It is her decision.
I've never had a choice
whether she comes or goes.
I will not tell her to go away,
If she does not want to.
Then, if you like,
I shall go away!
Oh, stop!
No doubt you prefer her
because she is a Shield-Maiden.
A warrior.
In that way,
she is more like you.
Bjorn:
What are you going to do?
Bjorn and hvitserk:
I don't want either of you
to leave.
I want you both to stay.
I want to believe you love me.
Then believe me!
Hmm?
Thank you.
I came to talk to...
Rollo:
We all know why you're here.
I was wondering-you were
wondering what I was going to do.
Yes.
Regarding my son.
I don't know what to do.
Then he should stay.
You both should stay.
Your wife would not be happy.
I imagine not.
Siggy: I think Ragnar is
still in love with Lagertha.
Are you?
In a way, yes.
And yet, it seems to be
another rollo
Who still loves her.
I am like a snake
which has shed its skin.
The pattern is just the same,
but the snake is new.
And this new rollo
does not love Lagertha,
Or suffer from desires for her.
Does that answer your question?
Athelstan:
Please, lord, hear my prayer.
I am weak.
Make me strong.
Come into me again, lord.
Ravish me.
Open my eyes, lord,
to the truth.
To your presence.
Why don't you show yourself
to me?
Let me be filled again, lord,
by the holy spirit.
you devil!
You devil!
I think he's ***.
Just assume that
we shall find him guilty
And confiscate his land.
Men:
Yes! Yes!
But, on this occasion,
I believe he should
keep his land...
And the accusers
should give him...
Three sheep?
All in favor, say baaaaah.
Crowd: Baaaaaaah.
Man:
Ragnar!
Ragnar:
Quiet! Thorvard.
Thorvard:
My lord Ragnar.
I hope you bring better news
than the last.
My lord, after you left,
The Saxons treacherously
attacked
King Horik's camp at Wessex.
There was a terrible slaughter.
A great many warriors perished.
The king and his son only just
escaped with their lives.
What about athelstan?
What happened to athelstan?
My lord, I don't know
of whom you speak.
Why has it taken so long
for me to hear this news?
My lord, bad news travels
a great deal slower
Than good news.
Man 1:
Make way, make way.
Man 2:
It's Lagertha.
Man 1: Make way, make way.
It's Lagertha.
Ragnar:  we
shall speak later.
Thank you.
What is wrong?
I have something important
to say.
Should it be said in private?
No. I want to say it
before everyone.
Lagertha:
I have come to a decision.
More than anything
in the world,
To stay here with his father.
And who can blame him?
If you had a father
like Ragnar Lothbrok,
Would you not want to stay?
I happily give my permission
to my beloved and only son
To remain here with his father
and his half brothers.
As for me...
I must go back to my husband.
I have a duty;
I am a responsible person.
But I leave my son
in your good hands.
Look after him, Ragnar.
He's all I have left.
Aslaug:
Lagertha.
Thank you.
There are no possible words
to describe
What you have done for us.
I will always be in your debt.
The debt is already paid.
The future is open.
Trust in the gods.
Live for each moment.
Don't take any more shit!
Lagertha:
Who do you think I am?!
