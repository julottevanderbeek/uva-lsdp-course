Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Do you have a reservation for me?
My name is Shade.
Thank you, sir.
Hello?
-Yes?
- There is no reply from Miss Tozer's room.
I see.
- May I help you?
-No, I'll, uh, I'll find her later. Thank you.
-Excuse me.
-Yes?
-I'm looking for Miss Eve Tozer.
-Oh, uh, try over there.
Thank you.
The only explanation I could think he's a married man.
And I kept saying, "Darling, I can't possibly accept this.  I just can't"
-He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.  He wouldn't take--
-Excuse me.
Ah, Charlie Shade!
What a surprise!  How the hell are you?
-Could I have a word with you for a moment?
Uh, yes.
Sure. Excuse me, just for a minute.
Now... what is going on?
It has to be something, to get you out of that cubby hole in London.
-Where is your father?
-He hasn't written me in over three years.
The last I heard, he was on a retreat or something
in Afghanistan.  Why?
-Bentik, has influenced a judge in London
to declare your father dead
-What?!
-Now, I got a three week stay
but there are only 12 days left.
If Bradley Tozer does not appear
within a British court, within that time.
You will lose everything.
-But, why?!
-The original agreement between
Bentik and your father stated that
in the event of death, the company's
assets would revert to the surviving partner
-That's ridiculous!
-Shhh.
-Charlie!
Daddy never would have done
anything like that to me.
-The agreement was drawn up
before you were born.
-How am I going to live without money?
-Well, you could sell your jewelry. You
could live happily for the rest of your life.
-Oh, Charlie, you know the way I spend money,
it wouldn't last me a year.
Well, we just have to find him
and get him back to London, don't we?
-Yes.
-Stay right here. Don't move.
Which one of you
would like the honor
of loaning me an airplane?
-The RAF would be delighted to
lend you an aircraft, Miss Tozer.
I'll have it back in two weeks.
-Oh, wait a minute! I thought
you meant just for the night.
Terribly sorry.
-Anyone else?
No champions?
So long, boys.
-Can I see you for a minute?
-Excuse me, Charlie.
Alright, Lina, what have you got?
-Well... you've got to promise me
not to say a word to anyone,
especially my husband.
-Lina, darling, you know
you can trust me.
-Promise?
-On my honor.
-'Fraid that's not good enough.
-I promise.
-Okay.
Two miles northeast of town
on the Zheng Paul road
you'll find an airfield.
Ask for O'Malley.
Some kind of war hero.
Anyway, now he gives
flying lessons.
-Is that what you call it, dear?
-You promised, remember?
-My lips are sealed. Thank you.
-If it's really urgent, you'll find him
every night, at the Blue Nile club.
Can't miss him.
Dark hair, dark eyes.
About 6'4".
-Sounds big.
-Yes, he's big.
-Come on, O'Malley. Come on, boy.
That a boy.
That's it.
Put the arm around me.
Walk.  Walk, one foot.
That's it.
The other foot.
Ah, look, he's walking.
-Did I drink too much, Struts?
-No, no.
-Let's get another drink.
-We're broke O'Malley.
-Oh, I hurt your suit.
You know what, Struts?
I got a feeling Lady Luck
is just around the corner.
-O'Malley!
-What?
-Stay away from my wife!
-Get outta here, ya rotten bum.
Come on, baby, come on, for papa, huh?
Come on.
-Excuse me?
Is your name O'Malley?
-That's O'Malley.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Damnit, this is ridiculous!
-Carlos!
Carlos!
-Hold on.  Right under there.
Don't let it go. Whatever you do
don't let it go. Hold, hold, hold!
See? He's up. He's up. He's up
and around,
he's going to be well again.
Everything is fine.
He's got great recuperative power.
-Mr. Struts!
Come quick! Come quick!
-Excuse me.
Now what have you broken this time?
-Mr. O'Malley?
I really think you should reconsider.
Surely we can find someone else,
besides this... person.
-I already have reconsidered, Charlie.
And, I don't see that we have any choice.
I hear you give flying lessons.
-Not today.  I'm hungover.
-Beat up is more like it.
I wanna rent your planes for
the next two weeks.
-Oh, really? What for?
-Ten thousand pounds.
And I supply the fuel.
-Ten thousand pounds? Okay,
what do you want to do with them?
-I want to fly them to Afghanistan.
-It's a little early in the morning
for this kind of nonsense, isn't it?
Besides, my friend here is a mechanic,
not a pilot.
-So?
-So who's going to fly the other one?
-I will.
-You ever flown one of those kites?
-You ever shave?
-Oh boy.
Okay.
Come on.
-Please, Miss Eve.
You're taking a terrible risk.
-Oh, Charlie, I'll be fine.
Here, hold this, will you dear?
-Here.
-Hey, um, hold on to this, kid.
Ah, the hell with it.
Hey, what are they doing?
-I'm not quite sure.
But, I think they're going to fly.
-Get in.
-Excuse me.
-Is he alright in that condition?
-Oh, ho, don't worry.
He's alright in any condition.
-Take it, kid.
-Mr. Struts!
-He's an ace!
Hey, kid, what'd I tell ya?
O'Malley's a great pilot, huh?
-Yeah!
-Perfect.
-Was it alright?
-It's swell.
This one'll do.
It takes alot of punishment.
-What about Mr. O'Malley?
-He'll go along.
Do you have five pounds, darling?
-I never saw you do a twist
in a double loop before.
Especially, with a cracker of a hangover.
It was great.
-Here you are, Ace.
Now. This, is for the flying lesson.
You get the rest when we arrive
in Afghanistan.
-Afghanistan?
-That's right.
-Come on, lady, will ya?
-Tozer. Eve Tozer.
-The society dame?
-So, what, do we have a deal?
-I'll say one thing for you. You
are determined.
But, you got more money than sense.
Look, you fly better than a quart of gin.
But Afghanistan...
-Waziristan, to be exact.
-Either way! It's over 1,200 miles.
What the hell's a dame like you
want to go there for?
-I am looking for my father, Mr. O'Malley.
He was headed in that direction
when he disappeared.
-Ohh, you're crazy.  Go hire yourself a
couple of camels, I wanna drink.
-Don't blow it, O'Malley. Don't blow it!
-Blow what? The dame's nuts.
-She may be nuts, but she's rich.
-It could be very dangerous up there.
-Charlie.
Mr. O'Malley.
Mr. O'Malley. The only thing that I can't buy
is time,
and you have the only two available
planes in the territory.
Now, you're probably a damn good pilot.
-Ah, come on, lady. The Waziris are at
war with the British.
-Well, we'll tell them we're Americans.
-That's right, we're Americans!
-And if they shoot first?
-I'll take that chance.
-Good. You take that chance.
-Alright. You can have another 10,000 pounds
for dangerous natives.
-And what if there's no place to land?
-Another 5,000 ought to cover any damages.
-That's fair.
-Then there's the plague.
-And another 5,000 for the plague.
That's 30,000 pounds, Mr. O'Malley.
-Unh-unh.
You can't buy me, kid.
-Ah, we have a man of principle here, Charlie.
Alright. I double my offer.
Pounds.
-Lady...
You just bought yourself one slightly used flying instructor,
and one ace mechanic.
I want half the money now!
And the other half in the London bank.
-No, Mr. O'Malley.
We'll give you 5 percent now.
And the rest in a Swiss bank.
-Deal.
-Pay them, will you Charlie?
-Take care of her, Mr. O'Malley.
-Charlie!
Yah-ha ah-ha-ha! We're rich!
We got it, it's all ours!
Everything we want!
-Come.
-It's---
-You still got the Louis guns, Struts?
-Yeah, what for?
-Well, you better mount 'em.
If we're going to Afghanistan,
we're going to need 'em.
-Guns?
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
Careful with the champagne, Tom.
-Yes, madame.
-Before I leave for London, I'm going
to have a word with the manager.
That bill is really far too high.
I'm sure they've cheated us.
-Charlie, worry, worry, worry.
-But your father would never forgive me, if anything
happened to you.
-You know me, I'm going to be fine.
-You've got to look after yourself!
Give Bradley my warmest regards when you see him.
-Absolutely, now give me a kiss.
Evie, look out!
-Charlie! Charlie!
You'll see.  You just mark my words,
we'll be nursemaids all the way there and back.
-She's okay, she's a good kid.
Just got a lot of spunk, that's all.
-Spunk?
She's a rich, spoiled brat!
If you don't watch out, she'll get us all killed.
-Hey, come on, O'Malley. Don't blow
this one, huh?
If she comes through with just part
of the dough, it'll bail us out and get us back to the States.
-Mr. Struts! Mr. Struts! Lady's coming.
-Alright, kid, come on, get off the plane.
-Let's go, Mr. O'Malley.
-What's the hurry?
-It's after 3 o'clock.
-Okay, so it's after 3 o'clock. So what?
This isn't a train station you know.
-What the hell's going on here, O'Malley?
-Let's go, Struts, let's go!
-Get off the field kid.
-Get out of here kid! I don't want you getting hurt!
-Wonder whose husband that was.
-Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik, I-
Ah, yes, Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik, sir.
-What is it?
-I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but
our agents have been unable to stop
Charlie Shade from contacting Miss Tozer.
-What?!
-The girl's escaped!
She's hired two planes and they flew off!
-Flew off?! Flew off where?!
-Well, our agents aren't sure. They tried to contact
an Arab boy who works at the Aerodrome.
-Well, stop her! That girl must not be allowed
to reach her father! Stop her, don't just crouch down there!
Stop her! Stop her!
Hopeless.
Lucky I had the old, uh, girl to chat with me.
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes, what is it?
-There are two unidentified aircraft approaching.
-Really?
Extraordinary.
Oh, well, I can have a look, I suppose.
Excuse me, chaps.
-Get my driver.
-Sir.
-I'll do the talking, I want to get
us out of here as soon as possible.
-They find out where we're headed,
they'll stop us.
-I'm not a fool, Mr. O'Malley.
-We need fuel and supplies, I'll handle this.
I know the army.
-Yes, but I know men. So, kindly stay out of it.
-I say, look here.
Do you both realize you're trespassing
on his majesty's property?
-Yes, well we--
-Major O'Malley.
Who's your C.O.?
-My God.
O'Malley.
Ha, you don't remember me, do you?
Johnny Silversmith. 24th.
How are you?
-Sure, sure, Silversmith. Still
collecting army pay?
-That's right. You gave us a bit of
a surprise for a moment.
Thought you might be somebody
dropping in from HQ,
to give us a bit of a spot-check.
Not to mention the bloody Waziri.
They're giving us plenty of headaches, recently.
Wiped out a column of men last week.
-Never stops, does it?
Listen, I thought we might be able
to buy some petrol, to get us back.
-Yes, I think that might be possible.
Where are you going?
-Well--
-Mr. O'Malley has been kind enough
to show me the sights.
How do you do? I don't believe
we've been introduced.
My name is Eve Tozer.
-How do you do?
-O'Malley.
-What a pretty fort.
-Yes, it is pretty, isn't it?
-I imagine it must get awful lonely
here though.
-Oh, it's not too bad really. One
gets the odd London paper
and a bit of mail from
time to time.
One survives.
-Well, that's something, isn't it?
Uh, tell me, is there someplace
that I could tidy up?
-Yes of course.
Better come along with me.
I, uh, do hope you'll be able
to join us for dinner.
-Oh, isn't that sweet of you?
I'd absolutely love to.
-Good, come along with me.
-Jesus, Ace.
-It wasn't funny at the time.
It wasn't funny at all.
We dive. Straight down.
And then old Dickey,
God rest his soul,
he took out the gun...
-Tell you about this magnificent evening
I spent with Tuppy Robertson.
I hadn't seen her for years.
Very dear old friend.
-Tuppy?
-Tuppy Robertson. Very, very
dear old friend of mine.
And I was in London, and he
telephoned me one evening.
Said, would you like to
come to the theatre?
And I said Tupps this is, this is
a magnificent idea.
-...so hard I thought she was
gonna break in two.
When I pull out of it, I got
that third son of a Hun, right in the belly.
-Tell us about Verdun, sir.
-Verdun?
-The captain said that you got
Is that true then?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure, that's right. I did.
Sent schoolboys into the air,
who couldn't even do a loop.
I got a medal for that one.
You see, that's all the Germans
had left
to send up against us,
were kids.
They should have been home
going to school.
Wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
Want to know what else?
If you get close.
Really close.
You see the fear on their faces.
-Remember Ellis, in Paris?
This guy put away 32 pints
of Guinness without
taking a piss on
Independence night.
-Darling, I'm absolutely fascinated.
Could you just hold that thought
one minute? Excuse me.
-Sounds jolly dangerous, sir.
-Nah it's a piece of cake, right Struts?
-Excuse me.  Mr. O'Malley.
-What?
-I think you've had quite
enough to drink for one
evening, don't you?
-I don't need you to tell me
when I've had enough.
-Well, as your employer--
-Piss off.
-Well, I say, O'Malley, that's really
just a bit too much.
-Maybe we ought to get a
little shuteye.
-Listen, ace. I don't buy all this
phony garbage that you're
handing out around here.
-The only phony around here
is the one I'm looking at.
All you rich bitches are the same.
-Oh, don't give me that, O'Malley. The
only reason you're here is because of money.
-You're damn right it is. For all
I care, you can take your money and shove it.
-Hey, come on, O'Malley. Let's get
back to serious drinking, huh?
-Mr. O'Malley. I will be leaving
first thing in the morning.
With, or without you.
-
-You're disgusting.
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Morning.
All gassed up and ready to go.
-Mr. O'Malley?
-He's ready too.
-O'Malley, come on baby, wake up.
O'Malley, wake up, come on.
-Where am I?
-Ft. Kipling.
-Oh yeah. That's right.
-I made a fool out of myself
last night, didn't I?
-You've done worse.
-Where is she?
-In your plane. You, uh, okay?
-Yeah, I'm alright.
I'm fine, let's go.
Hey!
Right on time!
-Mr. Bentik.
They've contacted that Arab lad.
They think the girl is going
to Waziristan.
-Where is Waziristan?
-Afghanistan.
-Well, of course I know that.
Whereabouts in Afghanistan?
Never mind.
Contact all my agents in the district.
Tell them that girl must be
stopped, at all costs.
-But, we don't have any agents
in Afghanistan, Mr. Bentik.
The Waziris killed them all.
-Nonsense.  Offer 100,000
rubies to the one who sees her.
-You mean "rupees"?
-I said "rupees"!
-Yeah, but that's only 23 pounds, Mr. Bentik.
-Very well, then. Make it
a million rupees.
Offer a million rupees.  Offer
them 10 million rupees.
-We don't have 10 million rupees, Mr. Bentik.
-I said offer them 10 million rupees. I didn't
say pay them 10 million rupees, you fool!
Why are you wearing that idiotic tie?
-Well, I thought that--
-Take it off at once!
-Couldn't you have a better
place to land?
-Wanna tell them we're American?
-Very funny.
-Which one is the Khan?
-He'll get here.
And when he does, I advise
you to keep your trap shut.
-Oh boy.
-Speak!
-We come here as friends.
-Friendship?!
We are at war with the English!
-The great and famous Suleman Khan
can see we are not soldiers.
-My people are angry at any white face.
For years, they have been fighting
the British dogs.
This land, is our land!
Soon...
every English infidel will be dead.
-We're not English, we're American.
-Tell that woman to shut her mouth.
-Do as he says.
-I find her eyes objectionable.
-Lower your eyes.
Do it!
-Very good.
I see you know how to treat women.
You will be my welcomed guests
for dinner.
-Does that mean he's going to eat us, or feed us?
-I think you really enjoyed that.
-Get up. It wasn't bad.
-You gonna ask him about my father?
-When the time is right.
-Excuse me, we are looking for my father.
-Stop it.
-Silence!
Your woman
she, uh, shows some courage.
Let me see the photograph.
Ah, of course.  Him.
-He is dead.
-That's impossible!
-Quiet!
How did he die?
-Uh, th-th-there was an unfortunate accident.
He was blown up.
A valuable and interesting man.
He is dead.
I have given your presence here...
much thought.
We will talk about our plans for tomorrow.
-What plans?
-The English...
have been marching against me
form Fort Kipling.
My spies tell me they are camped
over the mountains.
With your flying ships...
we shall destroy them!
-How?
-I have wonderful explosives.
That you will drop from the air.
-Surely the wise and powerful Suleman Khan can
see that I have brought a woman on this journey.
And that it is a mission of peace.
-You refuse me?
-If I do?
-You will not live to see the dawn!
I think you will do this for me.
Your friends will remain here.
Under my protection.
-I can fly off and leave them.
-My eldest nephew will sit behind
you in your machine.
Pointing his gun at your back.
I do not think you will fly away.
-You hold all the cards.
-Look, Miss. Maybe the guy was wrong.
Maybe he got him confused with
somebody else.
I mean, it's hard to recognize someone
just from an old photograph.
-I don't believe he's dead.
-My master's youngest brother would
like to buy this woman.
-That must be worth a fortune.
-Yeah, it's a fortune.
We could buy a whole new fleet
of planes with that.
Stocked with camels, a couple of new Avros.
That's worth a couple hundred-thousand
pounds, squirt.
-Do you really think that those people are
going to let you get out of here with that stuff?
-You must not speak! This
is a matter between men.
-Tell the Frantjen Khan that I am overwhelmed
by his more than generous offer.
Tell him
Tell him that she has serviced me
faithfully for many years.
But that I will think it over
very carefully.
-We will return tomorrow for your answer.
-Wait, wait.
You still have my father's picture.
-Yes. I will bring it to you later.
-Is he alive?
-Yes.
-Jesus, O'Malley.
That don't sound like too good
an idea to me.
I mean he can't be that dumb.
-What do they know about airplanes?
To them they're just some kind of
a flying ship. You sit in it like a wagon.
-Supposing it does work, what happens then?
-You two run for the other plane and
I'll cover you.
-You'll cover us?
-Yeah.
-How?!
-Okay. Forget it. You two think
of something.
-Listen, O'Malley, I--
-Speak!
-Speak?!
If you or one more person tells me
to speak or to not speak
or to lower my eyes, I am
going to let you have it!
I don't care if you kill me,
I'm going to let you have it!
-What are you doing down there?
-I've come to help you.
-Help me? How?
-To escape. If you allow me, I want
to go with you.
-Hey, that's great. You don't happen to have
a couple of machine guns on you, do you?
-Do you know if my father is here?
-No, he escaped. He has been gone for a year.
-Well, where's he gone?
-We spoke many times of my village, in Nepal.
He said he would go there when he left.
-Alright. Why didn't you go with him?
-I was captured four years ago, by
the Suleman Khan.
And my brother was killed. He was
tortured to death, while I watched.
I've been a slave here now, since then.
I wish I were dead like my brothers.
-Is there any chance that
you could get some clothes for these two?
Hats? Robes?
-Yes, I can.
-Okay.
-How far away from here is your village?
-Forget it. I know what you're thinking,
and you can just forget it.
-Listen, don't you tell me--
-Our deal was to get to Waziristan.
Nepal is on the other side of India.
-Our deal was to find my father.
-Finding your father has nothing to do with it.
I wasn't that drunk.
-You're always that drunk!
-Alright, hold it.
Why don't we just figure how to get out of here,
and worry about fathers and deals where it's safe.
- Okay.
-These, are the explosives you will use
against the English.
My eldest nephew, and his gun,
he will see that you do it carefully. And
return, when you need more.
-Ah, no, no.
Your nephew here, can have the honor of
dropping some of these bombs himself.
-No.
He must get in the front, so that I
can steer from the back.
-Remember, the English lives for your friends'.
-Could you please ask him to keep the gun
out of my face, until we're in the air?
Thank you very much.
Clear them away.
-We will celebrate your victory on your return.
-Good going, Alessa.
Struts, come on.
-Look, I found a cannon.
-Great.
-Don't panic, don't panic. Just keep going.
Come on, let's go! Run, run, run, run!
-Get in!
-Get in!
-Get her in!
-Get down! Get your head out of sight!
-Evie!
-Get down, get your head down real low.
-Woman!
-Ah, shit! Men!
-Do you read me?
-Yeah, I read you, O'Malley.
-You alright?
-We're fine.
Hey, O'Malley?
-Yeah?
-You were pretty good back there, Ace.
-Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.
-Alessa says, we should make Nepal in about
a day and a half.
-No! We're going back.
No! Wait!
Wait! No!
Come back!
-Mr. Bentik.
-What? What is it now?
-Excuse me, sir, but she's been seen in India.
-India?
You told me she was in Afghanistan!
-I know that, Mr. Bentik. But she's
been seen in India.
We have a definite report, she's on
her way to Catmandu.
-Are you trying to drive me insane with all these names?
-I'm just telling you what's in the reports.
-Where is she now?
-India. Going, it is believed, towards
Catmandu. That's in Nepal.
-I know perfectly well where Catmandu is.
Stop moving around.
Stand still! And pay attention.
Now, listen. You are to contact
Major Von Hess in Delhi.
Tell him that whatever happens, he is to
intercept her in Catmandu
before she reaches her final destination.
-
-How do I know her final destination, you
silly little twerp?
Don't ask asinine questions, do as you're told!
Why aren't you wearing a tie?
-I've run out of them, Mr. Bentik.
-Well, run out of here. Run!
-In there.
-Alessa. Would you ask her if my father is here?
-Ah, yes.
-Please.
-He is not here.
-Thank you.
-Any luck?
-No, he isn't here.
-How is she?
-Ah, she's okay. A little fever, but mostly tired.
A good night's sleep and she'll be the same
sweet kid again.
-Yeah, disappointment can really wear you down.
-I could use a drink. Wonder what kind of hooch
these people brew.
-They don't.
-What?!
-They're Buddhists. Drinking alcohol is strictly
against their religion.
-No kidding?
-Yep.
-They can't all be that religious.
-Ha!
-She's sleeping well now.
My mother says that her father was
here in the village.
But he's now gone.
-Well, does she know where he's gone?
-No, she doesn't. But he spent many
hours with his friend. Maybe he can tell you.
Grandfather Zura.
-Alessa, my child.
-These men would like to speak with you.
-Yes, yes.
Come and sit down, Mr. O'Malley.
I expected you.
News moves quickly in a small village.
-We came to find out about a man
named Bradley Tozer.
-It is his daughter that has come to find him.
-Yes.
Do you know where he is?
-Some time ago, a group of people came
through a pass, in the mountains.
From the province of Shengzhou.
It is there, that he has gone.
-Zhejiang, that's on the other side of the
Himalayas, in China.
-Yeah.
-A very dangerous journey.
I shall pray, to our lord, Buddha, that you
have safe crossing.
-Is there anything else you can tell us?
-The oxen are slow.
But the earth is patient.
-Thank you very much.
Okay, squirt.
Come on.
There you go.
-O'Malley?
-Yeah. Come on.
That's good.
-O'Malley?
-There you go. Come on.
-What's your first name, O'Malley?
-Patrick.
-Patrick?
-Mm-hmm.
-That's a nice first name. Patrick.
-Yes, I know it is. Come on.
-Okay, back to sleep, come on.
Go to sleep, baby.
-Herr Von Hess
-Oh my God, O'Malley!
You son of a bitch!
Get away, just get away from me.
I can't believe you, you slob! You drunken...
-Shut up, you witch!
-You cheap...
-Don't flatter yourself. Nothing happened.
-Don't flatter yourself, O'Malley. Nothing ever will.
I think you're disgusting!
-What the hell's going on?
I think you're immoral, presumptuous, and disgusting!
-No! You had a fever and chills!
He's just trying to keep you warm.
-Would somebody tell me what the hell is going on?!
-O'Malley!
O'Malley! Wait a second!
Listen, I'm sorry I barked at you like that.
Alessa has just explained. It was just a shock.
Oh, for God's sake, O'Malley, would you slow down?!
-If...you'll...drop it!
-Drop it? I'm the one who's saying I'm sorry.
-Look, if you start apologizing to me, then I gotta
act all humble-like, and accept. Don't I?
Well, I don't want to do that, see?
So let's just keep things the way they are, okay?
-Okay.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Will you wait a minute?
-What do you want now?
-We found where your father's gone.
-Where?
-It's through the mountains in Zhenjiang.
It's a province in China.
-Well, how soon before the planes can be ready
and we can get out of here?
-Forget it, you're not going.
-What do you mean, I'm not going?
-You heard me.
-Since when are you in charge of this
expedition, Mr. O'Malley?
Come back here!
-Hey, O'Malley, here she comes.
-Just ignore her. Maybe
she'll go away.
-O'Malley, I want to talk to you.
-Don't bother me, I'm busy.
-You son of a bitch. This is my trip
and I am paying the freight.Zhejiang
Now, I have been robbed, I have been
shot at,
I have been beaten up, I have
been bombed...
-Do you need this?
-Nah, you can dump it.
-...you practically sold me into slavery. And all
of a sudden...
-Will you two cut it out?
-..you decide, that some mountains are too
tough for the likes of a poor little,
defenseless creature like me.
Now, that is garbage, O'Malley!
It is unmitigated garbage!
If you would just listen to me, for once...
-Hey, O'Malley!
You hear something?
-Look, I put up the money for this trip. And
if you think that I'm gonna sit here, while
you fly off and get--
-Shut up.
-Don't tell me to shut up.
-Quiet!
Get down!
Struts! Come on, come on, let's go.
-O'Malley, what should I do?
-Just get out of here.
-Go get 'em, Ace.
-Clear it!
-Is he alright?
-I think he's okay.
You alright, O'Malley?
-Yeah.
-Did you get him?
-Yeah, I got him.
-Boy, he really shot you up, didn't he?
-Yep. He did.
-What happened? Where is he?
-Never mind where he is. I want to know
where he came from.
-What do you mean?
-Come here. I want to show
you something.
See that?
Jesus Christ! Look at my plane!
Now, I want the truth. Who
was that guy?
-Well, it might have been Bentik. You
know, the man who gets everything and--
-Hold it.
Hold it.
Let me get this straight.
There are people trying to kill us?
-Well, I wasn't sure-
-Hold it! Just wait a minute.
That day... when we left
That guy wasn't shooting at me.
He was after you.
-Yes, and I was gonna tell you that--
-Of all the rotten! dirty! dealing double-tricks,
that takes the cake.
Look at my plane!
-Well, I'm sorry, I never thought it
would go this far.
-Oh, that's a hot one. You never thought of
anyone else but yourself in your entire life.
You're nothing but a spoiled, snooty,
rich little brat!
-I'll buy you another plane.
-You're damn right you will.
And that's over and above
the hundred thousand.
-Does that mean you're still going?
-Yeah, that's right, I'm still going.
But I'm going solo.
-No! No. I will not give you one penny
unless I go too.
-That's not part of the deal.
-So, sue me!
-I don't have to sue ya. I'll wring your
scrawny little neck.
-Oh, yeah, go on. Do it, do it, do it!
Look at my Dorothy.
Look at my Dorothy. And then, give me
one good reason why I should take you along.
-He's my father.
-Okay.
You got any more little surprises?
-You alright?
-Yeah, I'm okay.
How long you think it'll take us
to fix her up?
-Ah, everything's going to be okay.
It just needs a little patching.
This means you're going to go, huh?
-Yeah, I got to.
-Her too?
-Yeah.
Listen, you going to be okay here
'til I get back?
-I'll be right here.
-You'd better be.
-Hey, ace, uh,
would you do me a little favor, please?
-Yeah, sure.
-Just remember that, uh,
remember, the ox is slow, but
the earth is patient.
-Mr. Bentik? Where is he?
Excuse me, sir.
-What is it?
-Well, I-I've been in touch with Major
Von Hess' headquarters in Delhi.
They've had no word from him. They
rather fear he may be... lost.
-How do you mean "lost"?
-Well, they can't find his plane.
-Well, where did they lose him?
-If they knew that, Mr. Bentik, he- he
wouldn't really be lost. Would he?
-You alright?
-Uh-huh.
-You speak English?
-You are under arrest! Under arrest!
You come! Come!
-He speaks English.
-Mm-hmm.
-After you.
-Thank you.
-Up! Go, go!
-Go!
-Sit! Here! You sit!
You wait.
-Daddy?
Daddy!
-Baby!
-Daddy, I've been looking all over for you.
-Well, let's have a look at you.
This is China. My God, where
did you come from?!
Jesus Christ, look at you.
You're beautiful. You're grown
up. You're a woman.
Oh boy, you look like your mother.
-I do?
-You sure do.
How did you get here?
-By plane.
Oh! Come here a minute.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
Mr. O'Malley, this is my
father, Bradley Tozer.
-How do you do? You look like
you're a long way from home.
-Nice to meet you... at last.
-Sit down, sit down, I want to look at you.
-Daddy, what the hell are you doing all
the way out here, in the middle of China?
-Look around, you'll see there's a war going on.
Not much of a war, as wars go,
but it's a war.
You see, there's this local hoodlum,
he's been climbing this hill for 20 years.
First, he takes their food away. And
then he rapes their women.
I hate to be the one to break tradition,
but somebody sooner or later,
gonna have to stop this.
-General!
-That's me. I'm the general. I don't know
why they call me General, but I kind of like it.
Now, I gotta go with this guy. Don't you
people go nowhere, I'll be right back.
-He's wonderful, isn't he?
-Well, he's something else. I'll
give you that for him.
-You know, I think I'd actually forgotten
how wonderful he was.
Even when I was a little girl, he always
seemed to be rushing around,
or doing something important.
-Did you always call him "daddy"?
-Yes, why?
-No reason.
Look.
We don't have much time.
So, if you tell him right away, I'm gonna try
and fly out of here, before it gets too dark.
-Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. O'Malley.
I'm aware of that.
-What's going on?
-He's moving his cannon.
What should we do?
-Nothing.
Not a goddamn thing.
You come with me.
Stay here and keep an eye on 'em.
-Then we gas up overnight. Then
another day to Guilin.
One more day to Hong Kong, if we're lucky.
Are you listening to this?
-Yes. Of course.
-That should give us an extra day to
get him into a British court.
-Well, that's it. It's like I figured.
He's moving his cannon.
He's seen your plane. He's taken it as
some kind of an omen, and he's coming.
Tonight, probably. Tomorrow morning at
the very latest.
The two of you gotta get the hell out of here.
-But we just got here!
-I know, and you just gotta leave. You can't stay
here, it's dangerous. You might get killed.
-But we want you to come with us. I
came here to take you back.
-Nope. I can't go with you.
Take a look around. Do you see these people?
These people need me.
It ain't gonna mean much, as far as
the world turning goes.
But, honey, there's battle's gotta be
fought. This may be one of them.
I'll bet you know what I mean, O'Malley.
-Yeah, I told myself that a couple of times.
-Sure you have. Everybody has.
And I want to thank you for bringing
her all this way to see me. It means alot.
Now, do you want to do me a big favor? Load
her back in that plane, and get her back over
them mountains just as goddamn
soon as you can.
-Well, we can't leave until morning
anyway. It's too dark to fly.
-Alright.
Come sunrise, you get in that plane.
You get the hell out of here.
And no nonsense, you hear me?
He's coming.
I'm ready for him! Now, Evie, you go
with Chenwa there. She'll show you
where you can clean up and lie down.
O'Malley, you're gonna come with me.
I'm gonna show you just how I'm gonna
whip this little bastard.
-Oh, actually, I'd kind of like to clean up
and lay down too.
-Oh no, no, no, no. None of it, you come with me.
-Let me take your coat for you, O'Malley.
-
Off you go.
O'Malley, you come with me. Now,
I built myself a foundry here.
Mr. O'Malley, would you come
and walk with me?
-Sure
-Good, come on.
Like I said, I've set up a foundry here.
I'm trying to forge out a cannon.
It won't do a bit of good though, I've
got no copper.
I can't make no cases, therefore
I got no goddamn shells.
-No shells? Right. What good's a cannon
if you don't have any shells?
-Well, it's part of the game you see. These
people are peasants. They're like children.
They figure this General Wang's got a cannon,
and they ain't got one.
Explosives. That's my game. That's
the ticket here.
I've set up 400 mines in front of this town,
just waiting for him to come across.
I'll blow him off the face of the earth.
I could whip this guy by myself.
-Let's get out of the gritty nitty.
What are you and my daughter
really doing here?
-Oh no, I think you better ask her that.
I'm just kind of the hired help.
-I got a reason for asking.
Tell me what she's doing here.
-Well, your partner, or someone, is trying
to have you declared legally dead,
so he can take over your company. She just came
here to bring you back, before he could do it.
-Bentik?
-Guess so.
-Well.. he's welcome to it!
What's left of it.
I'm surprised he hasn't bankrupted already.
You see, all the formulas and patents are
in my name anyway.
If I'm declared dead, that stuff
all goes to Evie.
-What?
-Sure! He'll have the company
but she'll have all the real wealth.
-What's going on?
-I'm washing my feet. What does it look like?
-Well, get your things together. We're getting
out of here. What'd you do with my map?
-What do you mean "we're getting out of here"?
It's too late, it'll be dark.
-Oh, come on. Look, kid, this is me you're
talking to now. We can be
a hundred miles away from here before
it gets too dark.
-Yes, but you heard what my father said.
He won't come with us.
-He doesn't have to. He explained the whole
thing to me. You'll have as much money
as you ever had. Probably a hell of a lot more.
-You told him?
-He asked me.
-What did you say?
-What's the difference?
-What did you say?
-Your money's safe. That's what you came
here to find out, isn't it?
So, let's get out of here while we've still got
a chance. Come on, sit down. Get your clothes on.
What the hell'd you do with my coat?
-Well, what about him? If we leave, he'll
be all alone.
-He was alone yesterday. And the day before.
So what? He doesn't need us.
He's got his war.
And you got your money. Now, if i can just find
my coat, it'll be a happy ending all the way around.
-No.
-What?
-No.
-No what?
-No, I'm not going.
Why can't we wait?
-What for? He wants you to go!
He can handle all this without us. To
him it's just a turkey shoot.
-He's just saying that to protect me,
and make us leave.
No, I'm not going without him, and
that's final.
-Final?
-Yes.
-Final? You're nuts! I said it all
along. You're nuts. And now that
I met your father, I can
understand why.
Blood. Bad blood. You're nuts!
Insanity runs rampant in your family.
Well, I'm getting out, you understand?
Out!
-What about your coat?
-I don't need my goddamn coat.
-Well, go on then, leave! See
if I care. I hate you!
O'Malley!
O'Malley!!
O'Malley, are you alright?
Oh my God, O'Malley, are you alright?
O'Malley, I'm sorry, I didn't mean what I
said.
Please, O'Malley! I--
-Speak!
-What?!
You rat!
You dirty rat!
Oh my God, I can't believe what a rat you are!
-Oh yeah?!
Well, what about you?!
What about my hundred-thousand?
You think I'm going and you won't
have to pay me, don't you?
Well, you're wrong, see? I
want my dough, lady.
It's coming to me, and I'm not
going 'til I get it.
-You'll get it!
-You bet I will.
-Why did you kiss me?
-Because I felt like it.
-Here's your coat. The map
is in the pocket.
We can leave tomorrow morning.
And as soon as we get to someplace that's remotely
civilized, I'll make sure that you get your money.
And then it'll be over, alright?
-Yeah, sure. Suits me just fine.
I didn't raise my boy to join the army.
So take your wars away.
Leave my boy to me this day.
I didn't raise my boy, to be a soldier.
-Rest well, and get her out of here in the morning.
-Are you sure you don't need my help?
-Bah, I could whip this bum in my sleep.
-Right.
-Take care of yourself, and thanks for coming.
-Hey!
Hello!
Where's Eve?
-Ah, Jesus, O'Malley! I thought
you'd be gone by now.
-Where's Eve?
-I don't know!
-Too soon! You're dropping 'em too soon!
-Wait.
It's okay. It's okay, just stay calm.
Just stay calm. Now, wait!
Wait!
Now!
No!
You dropped 'em too late!
You waited too long!
Wait.
Wait.
Do it, kid.
Do it.
Now!
Yeah!
Come on up here now, you baby-raping
son of a bitch!
Come on, kid. Pull it up.
-Alright, O'Malley! She got the
son of a bitch! She got that--
Okay, now--
-Give me that!
-You bring her back here!
-Eve? Evie?
Evie? You okay?
You hit? Evie?
Evie? Evie! Say something!
-Speak!
-Speak?! I'll wring your neck!
Speak? Very funny!
Look at my plane! You wrecked it.
-It was always a wreck, O'Malley.
-Down. Put your head down.
Here, take this.
-Where are you going?
-To get the Louis gun.
-It's empty!
This is empty too!
-Now, when I fire the next time,
you start running.
-Say Wong!
It's me, Tozer!
How do you do?!
-Keep your head down.
-What's going on?
-It looks like your father is starting
his show. Here, wipe your face.
It's dirty.
-Wong!
Take that, you son of a bitch!
Wire them.
Hoist the colors.
-Yes, sir.
-They're going.
-What?
-Yeah.
It's over.
I guess your old man won.
Ha, yeah.
Sure could use a drink.
-Make it a double.
-Well...
Thank you, O'Malley.
-What for?
-For just about everthing, I think.
For getting me here. For taking
care of me.
-Uh.. sure, squirt. Any time.
Listen, you better go back. Your
old man might need you.
-Oh, thank you.
What are you going to do?
-Me?
Well, I guess I'll just sit here
with my plane.
Figure things out.
It's a long walk back to Nepal.
-Yeah, it's mostly uphill.
-Yeah.
-Well
See you around, ace.
-Hey!
Come here a minute.
Closer.
Now...
Put your arms around me.
You know, I only made one real mistake.
-What was that?
-I should have sold you when I had the chance.
