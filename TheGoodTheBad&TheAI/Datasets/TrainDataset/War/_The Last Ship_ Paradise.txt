Chandler: Like the red
flu, it arrives silently,
infecting everyone it touches.
The victims have no idea
they've been poisoned.
They hear the news...
The cure has arrived...
So they rush out of hiding,
leaving safe zones and quarantines
for the promise of
protection, of salvation.
They don't know they're already dead.
And the deception at its core
makes it all the more sinister.
Whole nations are at risk
of complete extinction,
and they don't know it.
This is genocide.
Sir, the missile we found
contained enough of the anti-cure
to affect a 20-mile radius or more,
where the actual
cure would be delivered,
President Peng could kill
off a country the size of Japan
And how many more of these missiles
are out there, Captain?
It's hard to say, sir.
But we're pretty sure we
know where they're coming from.
Uh, Mr. President,
the intel from the man whose
ship we intercepted
suggests that the
missiles were either picked up
or manufactured from a
small island called Paraiso.
It was an old U.S.
Army forward operating base
from World War II.
Mothballed in the '50s,
it was believed to be
uninhabited until now.
And how certain are
you of this intelligence?
Fairly certain.
Peng is too smart to
do this out in the open.
He'd build and transport
these weapons out of sight
to conceal his involvement.
Sir, Shackleton and Hayward
have been running in circles
since this whole thing began.
I'd like them to join us.
My understanding is
that President Michener
once offered you those
ships and you turned him down,
Yes, sir.
And since then, you've left
a lot of bodies in your wake,
Captain, we don't know each other well,
but you need to know
that if my first act in
office is to declare war on China,
than the testimony of
smugglers and pirates.
Of course, sir.
find the source of these
missiles, tie it to Peng,
and I'll do everything in my power
to help you finish him off.
Consider those two
ships under your command.
- Thank you, sir.

Dennis, POTUS wants the
proof-of-life videos ASAP.
Please tell me you figured out
what's wrong with our video signal.
That distortion... the warble
on incoming communications...
Look.
It looks like noise, but it's not.
It's a signal meant to block
a part of the channel,
like a reserved carpool lane.
Where's it coming from?
I don't know, but
with this lane blocked,
it's taking up extra bandwidth
and we can't get a video signal.
Can you fix it?
Not unless I can figure out how
it got there in the first place.
I clipped off a few
chunks of data to analyze.
Each is a small burst of information,
but it's encrypted.
Been a while since ASW school,
but I know how to read a signal...
... and I know that pattern.
It's a human voice.
Wait, a voice? Are you sure?
Where's the president?
In the Oval Office, sir.
Those the troop-readiness reports?
All available military assets
- and what's left of our leadership on the...
- Save it.
I got it.
- I'm sorry, Kara.
- It's fine.
I know you're feeling a
little bit boxed out these days,
and I have not done
enough to bring you in,
but believe me, I'm working on it.
Things are changing around here,
but we all still want the same thing.
And Secretary Rivera?
Well, I'm gonna have to operate
under the assumption
that he's as much of a
patriot as the rest of us.
Hey, Doc, give me the room.
I'll check on your wife and son.
Thank you.
How they doing?
My son is strong.
My wife and I...
The transfusions are
becoming less effective.
Heard you were looking for me.
What Peng did to Japan,
we cannot allow that to happen again...
Anywhere.
On that, we agree.
Let me help you.
I have men. I have
ships. I know these waters.
We can fight him together.
I owe you that much.
Captain.
Get some rest, Captain.
Vulture team is on Paraiso
Island, heading out.
Roger that, Nomad.
Chandler: Nathan
James, Vulture team on deck.
All conditions normal.
On the move.
Roger, Vulture team. Good luck.
Wolf, Burk, sitrep?
That boat came to this
island for something,
so unless this is a hot
spot for drugs and champagne,
the missiles are here.
"Paradise"... That's
what "paraiso" means.
That's either Peng's
idea of a joke, or...
I met the man. He's not that funny.
Raining poison green
death on his neighbors...
That's Peng's idea of a joke.
Used to be a 16-inch gun
there, size of a building.
They took defending the
island pretty seriously.
Thank God it's not there anymore.
Kanoa: A little help?
We heard rumors
about a safe place to live,
far from the red death.
And people from all over...
Laos, Vietnam, China, the Philippines...
Came here to be safe.
So we started schools,
farms... Everything.
Everything is perfect here.
Paradise.
Yes, exactly. Paraiso.
We walk from here.
When was the last time
this base was operational?
X.O. said early '50s.
No, it must've been later.
"Rebel Without a
Cause" came out in 1955.
I went through a James
Dean phase in high school.
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
These are friends...
American friends.
Why are you here in Paraiso?
How did you hear of us?
We were sent to the base to check
on old weapons ordnance.
Know of any?
No. No, my friend. No weapons here.
China has claimed most of
the islands in this chain.
President Peng know you're here?
Yes, oh, yes.
Peng knows.
He leaves us alone to live in peace.
How do you live? What goes on here?
We work.
We have a factory.
Everyone buys from us.
We'd like to see this factory.
Of course.
Of course. I will show you.
See?
Very productive.
And...
the best quality.
Single stitch, overlock stitch.
They go all over... Laos,
Vietnam, Cambodia.
Please.
My apologies.
They get paid for how
many items they make.
We should not interrupt.
I can answer your questions.
What, are we storming a Hanes factory?
Kanoa: I can show you the school now.
We have many children, thanks to God.
You know, this isn't the
factory I wanted to see.
I don't understand, Captain.
This is the only factory on the island.
I swear to my God.
Malaya! It's just a dog!
Who is she?
Don't worry about her.
Silly girl.
She's been giving us trouble lately.
Maybe it's her age.
Captain?
No.
This is not necessary. What is he doing?
Help us. Please.
I-I am scared.
My parents are dead. I live here alone.
- I am scared every day.
- It's okay.
Hey, calm down. It's all right.
Y-you're safe.
Tell me, what's going on?
You're Americans?
Yes.
I'm Danny. Tell me your name.
I-I am Malaya.
I-I am a slave here.
You're a slave in... in that factory?
Making clothes?
No.
There is a-another factory,
a-a real factory near
the big, old guns.
What do you make at that factory?
Malaya, Malaya. Please, no.
Just go. Just go now.
Shut her mouth about what?
Nothing.
Tell them about the
ship that came yesterday.
What kind of ship?
Malaya.
A... a Chinese warship.
Captain, she says there's another
factory on the island.
It's match point.
You decide how you want to play it.
Either way, you're taking
us where we want to go.
Kara, glad I caught you.
Secretary Rivera.
What brings you to my office?
I'm worried, Kara.
About what, sir?
About you,
about whose team you're on.
Sir, I am just as
committed to the recovery
of the United States as
I was when I first landed
in St. Louis with Captain Chandler.
Ah, yes. The great Captain Chandler.
The legend, the man that we devoted
enormous amounts of time and resources
to get out of trouble.
I understand your concern, sir,
but now that Captain Chandler
has uncovered a genocide in Asia...
A... alleged genocide.
Kara, you have to remember,
we're living in a post-apocalypse.
Facts and truths are just as
much the victim of this plague
as everything else.
Right now, the best thing we can do
is focus on the American people.
I'm not sure exactly what
you're suggesting.
Can you be more specific?
What I'm suggesting, Kara,
is that while
everyone is looking eastward,
our country is
collapsing beneath our feet.
And when the chips fall,
it's important you
know who your friends are.
Is that clear enough?
Yes, sir.
I'm glad.
Stop the cart.
What's down there?
Uh... just an old bunker...
I want to see it.
I don't have any keys.
We do.
Burk.
Access granted.
Please, there's no one down here.
We may have found the entrance
to the munitions factory.
Roger that, Vulture team.
T.A.O., spin up two TLAMs.
I want enough to burn up
everything in that factory.
Aye, sir. MSS, T.A.O., spin up two TLAMs.
See?
Nothin...
Take cover!
Nathan James, Nathan James,
Vulture team is engaging the enemy.
- Vulture team, fall back.
We'll provide fire
support with the five-inch.
Negative. I need to see what's
inside that facility.
Paradise, my ass.
Nathan James, Vulture team
advancing on munitions site.
Combatants neutralized.
All right, Vulture team.
Burk: This is the place, all right.
Looks like Peng had
them clear everything out.
Like he knew we were coming.
And here's one of their
missiles... or part of one.
Okay.
But where'd they go?
What's it say?
Inchon.
The missiles are headed to Korea.
Malaya was right. He's
not shipping his missiles
on a small pleasure boat anymore.
No.
He took a warship.
Sneaker. Tropics. Flaming.
What the hell is that?
Here's the second batch.
This is what's been
blocking our video signal.
And we don't know what it means.
This code... It's either super simple
or enigma-level complicated.
But, Kara, based on this data,
it looks like the signal is coming from
inside this building.
There are several
different shipping lanes
with varying currents
that the Chinese destroyer
could've chosen.
This here... This is used for
oil tankers and commercial ships.
It runs north from here to
the leeward side of Taiwan
then splits off after Yonaguni Island.
The eastern route goes
to Vladivostok and Japan.
The western route... that
runs straight north to Korea.
And you recommend
that as our new course?
Well, given the limited
information we have, sir, yes.
Captain, do you concur?
Peng knows you are looking for him.
He will use the Formosa Strait
between Taiwan and the mainland.
It is more narrow,
with more obstacles
to hide from the radar.
That's where we'll find the
ship carrying the poison.
Then that's our new course.
Captain's on the bridge.
Sir, you have Nathan James.
This is Hayward Actual, over.
Captain Meylan, how are things?
Sir, the Hayward is
at her fighting weight
and happy to be of service
to you and the Nathan James.
Couldn't ask for a better wingman.
I read your service
record since Annapolis
and I know how admirably
you distinguished yourself
during the plague.
I'm not in your league, sir,
but I certainly
appreciate the sentiment.
I've spoken with Commander
Hicks on the Shackleton.
From his position, he can
run point into the Strait.
- We'll be right behind.
- Outstanding.
Intel suggests the
intercept point will be
You'll beat us there,
but we'll intercept the
Chinese destroyer in two hours.
We have designated that
destroyer with the code name
- Sea Dragon.
- Sounds about right.
C.N.O., is this a stop,
board, and seize operation?
No, Captain.
It's a cut the head off
the dragon operation.
Understood.
You're not alone.
DESRON is ready for tasking, sir.
That was Tom Chandler?
Damn right it was.
So, this is where Chandler's
gonna meet our other ships.
Yes, sir. In the Formosa Strait.
Captain Chandler just radioed in.
He's at 23.41 North by 118.83 East.
Shackleton's approaching from the north,
Hayward from the south-southeast.
That's how they'll triangulate
and attack the Chinese destroyer.
Anyway, I hope this puts
an end to this chapter.
C.N.O. on the bridge.
Hayward's hull-down on the horizon.
Let's close the distance.
Sea Dragon's out there.
We'll have surprise, but not for long.
- O.O.D., all ahead full.
- Aye, all ahead full.
Nathan James, this is Shackleton.
We have a SKUNK 14 miles out,
heading north at 32 knots.
Roger, Shackleton.
Slattery: Sea Dragon's hauling ass.
Hayward, this is Nathan
James. Do you have SKUNK?
Nathan James, I'm looking
at the same picture you are.
We have the target.
Designate ship as hostile.
Aye, sir.
Set General Quarters.
General Quarters, General Quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.
You know what this means...
Sinking that destroyer.
- War.
- Declared by us.
If it comes down to
it, I'll take the heat.
No, sir. We'll take it together.
Woman: Shackleton, this
is Hayward. We hold ES...
I cracked it.
The three words...
They're map coordinates.
GPS?
Simpler, sort of. Th...
They're closing in on
the Chinese destroyer.
Man: All units in Zulu,
this is Zulu Actual.
I did some research.
The three words, it's a system that maps
every nine-square meter spot on Earth.
Look. This message just
came in across the line.
Another three words...
Barn, table, yard...
- And here's the GPS coordinates it lines up with.
- Dennis?
Give me everything.
Here it is, in order.
How far away is the Chinese destroyer?
Um, sir, last time we heard,
it was 15 kilometers from the James,
closer to the other ships.
Contact has slight
left bearing drift... over.
Recommend Hayward close Sea
Dragon. Remain at EMCON.
Aah!
Man: We have relative
bearing 3-0-5 degrees.
Woman: SKUNK Alpha,
present target position 1-8-0...
Got a solid spot track on the target.
CIC, coordinate fire control solutions
with Shackleton and Hayward.
- Bird's affirm.
- CIC, bridge.
We are five minutes from
the rendezvous point.
Who are these guys?!
Chinese Secret Service!
The Formosa Strait between
Taiwan and the mainland.
Man: Sonar range from slant
range and target depth.
Man: Ready to fire on
any surface contact.
All ships, stop! Stop! Stop!
Vampire! Vampire! Vampire! Fox
three inbound bearing 2-5-6!
Launch chaff!
All personnel, brace for impact!
Hicks: This is the
Shackleton. We have incoming.
Corpsman! We need a
corpsman on the bridge!
Sound and Security...
report damage and flooding status.
Man: Sound and Security.
We have water integrity.
CIC, bridge.
Did those missiles come
from the Chinese ship?
Negative. They launched from mainland.
- They knew we were coming.
- How the hell?
Meylan: Nathan James,
this is Hayward Actual.
We have incoming. Request air cover.
Woman: Brace for impact!
Cameron: There are more vampires.
- Air, kill track 4-8-7-2-6 with birds.
- Air, aye.
Killing track 4-8-7-2-6 with birds.
Attention Shackleton, all hands!
Prepare to abandon ship!
All hands, prepare to aban...
Vampire! Vampire! Vampire!
Second fox 3 inbound.
Third fox 3 inbound.
Birds away, track 4-8-7-2-6.
Air, kill vampires 2 and 3 with birds.
T.A.O., RSC. Vampire 1 trashed.
- Multiples still inbound.
- Birds away.
Vampires 4 and 5.
We've lost incoming
signals from all three ships.
CIC, trace incoming
missiles. Target land batteries.
Alisha: Solving, sir.
Tom, we can't let
that Chinese ship get away.
T.A.O., you got target coordinates
on that SKUNK?
Solving now, sir. Stand by.
T.A.O., track 3-5-8-2-9
designated hostile,
- standing by to kill with birds.
- Captain, T.A.O.
Standing by for fire orders
on SKUNK and land battery.
- Fire! Fire!
- Missiles away.
Vampire 5 is going supersonic.
Bridge, brace for impact! Port side!
T.A.O., CIWS engaged.
Confirm, SKUNK is
trashed. Sea Dragon is sunk.
Confirm, land battery trashed.
Captain, C.N.O., Shackleton is gone.
No longer responding to hails.
Not visible on radar.
Get Nomad in the air.
Search for survivors.
Put rescue and VBSS teams in the water.
Save what's left of Hayward.
-
- Up.
Here we go, buddy. On two.
One, two, three, four.
You're gonna be all right.
O'Connor?
Miller.
You son of a bitch.
I heard you were on Shackleton.
I thought you were dead.
I got transferred to Hayward a week ago.
I thought you were dead.
Master Chief.
Master Chief. Never
thought I was gonna see you.
Later. Let's help the wounded.
Aye, aye.
Nathan James, Nomad.
Captain, I see an oil
slick about a mile long.
Heavy debris field,
no bodies in the water.
No signs of life. No
apparent survivors, sir.
Sorry, Captain.
Roger, Nomad. Return to ship.
Search and rescue will
continue as long as they have to.
Whoever did this,
if they know we're still
afloat, they will be back.
We'll leave no one behind,
Captain. You have my word.
What the hell happened?
We were set up.
We don't know how or by whom,
but Peng knew exactly where we'd
be and when we'd be there.
Sir, may I ask, how did we
end up at these coordinates?
Who sent us here?
Takehaya.
The Japanese pirate?
The same man who
kidnapped and tortured your crew?
He's not responsible for this.
He's with us now, against Peng.
I'm not sure I understand, sir.
Captain Slattery will show
you to your quarters,
brief you on the particulars.
I know we lost a lot today,
but we prevented a genocide in Korea.
We'll take care of our wounded,
then we'll finish Peng off for good.
Yes, sir.
Kara.
I want to know why you
tried to stop our ships.
Sir?
You knew they were gonna be attacked.
I want to know how.
It was just an instinct, sir...
The way they were
being drawn into that pass.
An instinct.
They've been ambushed before, sir.
I have the Nathan James.
This is Secretary Rivera.
This is C.N.O. Listen up, 'cause
I don't have much time.
We were taken by
surprise... All three ships.
James is seaworthy, Shackleton
was sunk, Hayward damaged,
and survivors, including Captain Meylan,
- are now aboard the James.
- How did this happen?!
It is my belief that our
lines of communication
have been compromised by the enemy.
Until further notice,
we will be at EMCON.
- X.O., set EMCON Alpha.
- Aye, sir.
Is that Captain Chandler?
He just hung up.
Well?
The James survived the
attack, but we lost the Shackleton,
and the Hayward is seriously damaged.
Captain Meylan is with the C.N.O.
- I want to talk to them.
- I'm sorry, sir.
But they went radio silent.
Damn it, why? What happened?
Sir, we were ambushed.
Somehow, the Chinese knew where
all of our ships would rendezvous.
This is a Goddamn disaster.
- Mr. President...
- Give me a minute.
We have a Marine Recon
Division. They're scattered,
but they could be
organized and deployed to Asia.
If they flew to Pearl,
they could then sail from there
to effect a search and
rescue of our ships.
That's not gonna happen.
What the hell does that mean?
Just what I said.
Chandler's China adventure ends now.
Sit down, Howard. We need to talk.
Don't tell me to sit down, Allison.
Do you know who the
hell you're talking to?
I do.
You were the mayor
here. You ran a great city.
This was your town.
Damn right. And now I'm the president.
I'm gonna ask you one more
time, Howard. Sit down.
Sit down, my ass.
What are you doing?
I'm tossing you the hell out.
- You're fired, Allison.
- There's nobody to call, Howard.
The lines have been cut.
Since the disaster at sea,
the White House has
been put on lock-down
on your orders.
On my orders?
Are you joking?
Not at all.
Oh, we'll see about that.
Who the hell are you?
Your security detail has
been repurposed, Howard.
From now on, my men, Agents
Murphy and Costas,
will protect you.
My God, Allison. What have you done?
Mr. President, through
no fault of your own,
you've stepped through the looking glass
into the birth of a new America.
The pandemic, the millions of deaths,
the complete collapse of law and order
demands a revolution of governance.
Revolution? You mean coup d'état.
Who are you working with? Castillo?
Castillo, Price, Wilson, Croft.
America can no longer be governed
by a central power,
not now.
Each region must look after itself.
Sons of bitches. I knew it.
Relax, Howard. This is a good thing.
You knew that Michener
was moving too fast,
that America wasn't healthy enough
to go back to the way things were.
There are no states. There are no cities.
There are only tribes scrambling
out of the mud
over the bodies of 300
million dead Americans.
Face it, Howard... Democracy is a luxury
that we can no longer afford.
Be patient, Alex.
This is crazy. I mean, what
the hell are you talking about?
-
Oh, my God.
Who is this?
Senator Beatty.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna get you help.
No, no, no, no, no. Kara, Kara!
T-T-They're all in on it.
Who? What... What do you mean?
You're not safe.
By now, Senator Beatty and
Secretary Rivera are dead.
If you try to contact any
of your allies in the city,
the consequences will be swift...
As swift as they were
for Jeffrey Michener.
You're insane.
That's it.
Y-You've gone completely insane.
Do you understand me, Howard?
Your family, your friends...
None of them will be
safe if you do not play ball.
Take a minute and think about it
before you make any
decisions you'll later regret.
Everybody likes you, Howard.
It's a big table, and
there's a place for you at it
as long as you go with the program.
Have I made myself completely clear?
This office is your home now.
I'll see you in the morning.
We've got a lot of work to do.
