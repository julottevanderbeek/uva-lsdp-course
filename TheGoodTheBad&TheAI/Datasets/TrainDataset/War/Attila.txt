Though decadent and corrupt,
weakened by politics and war,
the Roman Empire remained
the greatest power on earth.
Then a new people, the Huns,
fierce and independent,
appeared from the east.
An ancient prophecy told of a man
who would one day unite the tribes
and challenge Rome
for the right to rule the world.
- My arrow fell short!
- Aim higher.
The deer outruns it.
Perhaps it's time
you had a stronger bow.
We're on Dunnotis' land.
The chase was long.
We meant no harm.
We'll send him
the antlers as a gift.
Still, we might have been seen.
If Dunnotis complains, we kill him.
Hush, boy. It's foolish for Huns
to kill Huns.
How can we conquer the western lands
if we fight among our own?
Father spoke of the western lands
during the hunt.
He was there once,
when he was young.
Did he discover them?
No, no... Others discovered them
long ago.
How?
A gadfly.
A warrior was taming a stallion,
and a gadfly bit the stallion
so hard, it ran away.
The warrior followed
the stallion into the great marsh.
But there's no way past the marsh.
Oh, the horse found a way,
and the warrior followed the horse,
- and on the other side...
- He found the western lands.
Father says we'll conquer them.
- When the Great King comes.
- How will we know when he comes?
The Great King
will kneel to no man,
and all men will kneel to him.
He will rule the Hun as one nation,
and hold the sword of the war god
in his hand.
And...he'll go to bed
when he's told.
Yes, Father.
No! Attila, stop!
- I want to help! Let me help!
- Get under this cart.
You stay in there.
Get out of the way.
Father!
Father.
Father...
Get him!
You are Mundzuk's son.
Where is my grandmother?
She is dead. Your father is dead.
That's his reward
for hunting on our lands.
I am your master now.
Kneel.
Kneel!
And I might let you live as my slave.
Hyah! Hyah!
What's your name, boy?
Attila, son of Mundzuk.
Don't you recognize me?
I am Rua, your father's brother,
and it's a long time
since you've seen me.
- My father's dead.
- Yes. Weeks ago.
You've been alone all this time?
You're safe now. Come.
Unless you prefer
living alone on the steppes.
What are the three sacred animals?
The wolverine,
because he never retreats,
the sheba,
because she protects her young,
and the horse,
because it is sacred to the war god.
- How many layers in a bow?
- Two of wood, two of bone.
How long must you heat
the bow before you string it?
Until the outer layer sweats.
You've been taught well.
Go to your tent.
He doesn't belong here.
I took my brother's wife
and elder son.
Should I leave the younger
to die on the steppe?
Yes.
Yes, for Bleda's sake.
He's the elder.
He'll get the larger portion
when I die.
There will be trouble between them.
I can see it already.
Who's there?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Attila.
- I am Galen.
- What are you?
- A girl. Are you blind?
- You look like an old woman.
- I'm no older than you.
- Why aren't you with the others?
They're afraid of me.
Why are they afraid of you?
Because I read the stars and the sky
and the sun and the moon.
You're a witch.
I had a vision yesterday
that he would be born.
- Who?
- The Great King.
Stay back.
I was born ten years ago.
No.
You were born yesterday,
on the steppes.
Ah, yes.
Yesterday, on the steppes.
Some say it takes months
to make a bow.
But...it takes 15 years.
It starts when the tree
is first planted.
You cut the wood too soon,
the bow lacks strength,
too late, it becomes brittle.
King Rua... We found them.
Are these the men
that attacked your camp?
They're yours.
You do with them what you will.
- There were more of them.
- They were killed. These remain.
- Kneel.
- Kneel to a boy?
Submit to me and live.
Attila!
Have you spoken to the scouts?
They saw no force of any kind
between us and the river.
Good.
IMPERIAL PRISON
ROME
You should be used to it by now.
We guards eat the same food.
It's slave food.
Only a slave could get used to it.
Aaargh!
I am Flavius Aetius.
Rome endures.
I will endure.
Parthians, Scythians,
Macedonians, Picts, Gauls, Britons,
Angles, Franks, Jews, Egyptians.
The list of defeated peoples
is endless.
- Why are Huns different?
- They simply are, Majesty.
- Wait till they face Roman troops.
- They've defeated us before.
From the Eastern Empire.
We're made of different stuff.
- We have no troops near the border.
- Send them from somewhere else.
Not possible.
We're overextended as it is.
Is it serious? The Huns
have been a nuisance for decades.
- They've crossed into our territory.
- They're isolated raids.
And when they realize how little
resistance we can offer, what then?
Placidia, one man
might be able to deal with them.
Aetius will not leave prison alive.
He knows their customs,
knows their king.
I said no.
Felix, I know my son is...
immature, but he is learning.
He's emperor now,
and he'll rise to the occasion
as other emperors have before him.
There! I did it!
What shall I hit?
That vase sitting on the pedestal?
Idiot!
He's ruined my shot!
I'll think about what you said,
but I have to be convinced that
the Huns are a serious threat.
Invaders! Invaders!
Go! Get moving!
Wait! Your name?
N'Kara.
You fight bravely.
Put her with the slaves.
Her sword was the bloodiest of all.
If she has kin, spare them as well.
You may leave.
I once swore you'd never
leave this prison alive,
but your friends have
begged me to be merciful.
In the light of their plea...
There's only one conceivable
reason for you to be here.
- You need me.
- Why would I need you?
If I had to guess,
I'd say the Huns are on the move,
and you and the rest of Rome
are petrified with fear.
There have been reports
of a new warlord...
among the southern tribes - Attila.
Do you know him?
No, but I know King Rua,
and that's what matters.
My son is young. He needs someone
to guide his decisions.
You can serve your country
instead of your own ambitions,
- if that's possible.
- Anything's possible.
What's your price?
First, a full pardon.
You tried to depose me, before
my son became of age. That's treason.
Let's call that a misunderstanding.
What else?
Full restoration of my estates,
personal staff, hand-picked by me,
and...
reinstatement to the rank
of master of both services.
If I am to deal with the Huns,
I must have the supreme command.
- Felix has the supreme command.
- Remove him.
- He recommended your release.
- I'll thank him.
- You can rot in this cell forever.
- And you?
You can find someone else
to deal with the Huns.
Warden.
Release him.
He is your new supreme commander.
The guard who brought me
my food, what's his name?
Petronius, my lord.
- Father!
- Lydia.
Oh, you're really free!
Oh, I was afraid to believe it.
I came to the prison
but they wouldn't let me see you.
My God, look at you.
You're a young woman,
and a lovely one at that.
The villa's really ours again?
Yes.
And the one in Sicily too.
Tomorrow I'll bring in workers.
It'll be as beautiful as ever.
Come on, move!
You wretches, move!
Ha, ha, you're in my lot now!
King Rua,
I bring you tribute from our victory.
A victory over farmers?
The people are watching.
You are brothers!
Embrace like brothers.
Let us see the treasures
that Attila has brought us!
Attila, don't let your brother's
envy spoil your victory.
He's right.
It was a village defended
by peasants and farmers.
We fight peasants
because no one else dare fight us!
Yes. Not even the Romans.
- Rome? That's a different matter.
- We are Huns. We fear no one.
True.
But, uh, why wake a sleeping lion?
We were 50 leagues
into their territory.
There were no legions,
no soldiers. Not one.
Let me take a larger army
and go further.
- How much further?
- To Rome itself.
What will you do when you get there?
Scratch against the walls?
They're wide as wagons,
but they're made of stone,
not of wood!
I scared you.
Galen scared the great Attila.
- I could have killed you.
- What did you bring Galen?
- Nothing.
- Attila always brings something.
- You did, didn't you?
- Maybe.
Did you have another vision
while I was gone?
- Maybe. What did you bring me?
- And no more about the god of war?
That vision has been in our tribe
since we crossed the great marsh.
After a hard battle,
the war god fell asleep.
His sword dropped from his hand.
Whoever finds it will rule the world.
You must believe it, Attila.
Why?
Because when you're
in my visions, so is the sword.
A handle of gold and ivory,
crowned with rubies.
I won't even rule the tribe.
When my uncle dies,
Bleda will be king.
Bleda's not in my visions. You are.
Go away, woman!
Leave me alone.
To think of the red-haired woman.
The whole tribe knows.
A red-haired woman
has caught Attila's eye.
A red-haired woman has caught...
Tonight we celebrate
the victory of Attila,
the first with Roman spoils.
Bleda, as the eldest,
you take precedence, however.
Choose wisely.
Attila, your raid
has brought us many riches,
and I commend you.
Since I did not fight,
I claim nothing of value.
Only...
an animal, unknown in these parts.
A strange creature
with piercing eyes and red fur.
Bring it in.
Later tonight,
I may start my own race.
Huns with red hair.
Attila, what are you doing?
You can't kill Bleda. You can't!
Not in Rua's tent,
but when he comes out,
I will be waiting.
No. Your time has not yet come.
This morning I had another vision.
Destiny has chosen you,
but only if you bide your time.
I'm tired of your visions!
No! I won't let you.
A woman.
Hey, Galen.
If you fight with Bleda over a woman,
the tribe will turn its back on you.
Even if you win, you lose.
Go back to Rua's tent,
claim your share of the spoils,
claim the conquered village.
- Am I a farmer, that I need land?
- Claim the village.
It was in my vision.
Next!
The horse shied.
You and your horse are one.
His mistake is your mistake.
The beast with red fur.
The toadstool who talks.
Bleda mounts you
more often than he does his horse.
It is no choice of mine.
I'd sooner die than bed a Hun.
Then why don't you?
My sister and mother.
If I kill myself,
Bleda will kill them.
They live because of Attila.
I've seen the way he looks at you,
and the way you look at him.
I belong to Bleda.
A Hun doesn't possess a woman
until she bears his child.
If you bear Bleda's,
Attila won't want you.
And how can I help it?
These seeds.
Swallow one every day.
They will keep
little Bledas out of your womb.
Attila or Bleda?
Bleda or Attila?
I know who Galen would choose.
We don't even know
if the Huns will attack again.
Trust me, they will.
I lived among them when I was young.
How did that happen?
There was a treaty,
an exchange of hostages.
They are brave, strong,
and far from stupid.
Is it true their women
walk around naked?
They crossed the border
here above Cologne.
They sacked 20 villages.
As I told Felix, we should
send troops to punish them.
And as he told you,
we have none to send.
If we pull legions from the west,
the Goths will pillage us instead.
The Huns have violated
our territory,
and therefore
insulted my divine person.
The insult must be avenged.
It was the Huns that drove the Goths
against us in the first place.
And split the empire.
That's why I rule the West
and Theodosius the East. I know.
Yet your divine brain
does not grasp the point.
What we must avoid at all costs is
fighting the Huns and Goths at once.
Mmm!
Traitor. I'm your sister.
You're supposed to help me.
You wanted to be kissed.
Flavius Aetius.
The divine Honoria.
I hope you're
behaving yourself, Aetius.
If you don't, Mummy said
she'll throw you right back in jail.
Forever.
Mummy will have her joke.
- Shall we continue, divine one?
- We're going to the Forum.
Pritella's daughters
will be there.
We'll finish later.
I have to talk with Mummy, anyway.
Later, Aetius.
I...command it.
Goodbye, Mummy.
Where is my son going?
To the Forum.
He needs rest
from his intellectual labors.
- But he is progressing?
- No.
Nevertheless, whatever steps
you take, you will take through him.
After he obtains your approval.
Some things need immediate attention.
Training of troops,
stockpiling of supplies.
See to that on your own.
- It would help if I had your seal.
- Why?
Three years in prison
have destroyed my reputation.
I need proof
that I act on your behalf.
The Huns are at our border, Placidia.
We must both forget old hatreds.
Petronius...
Don't worry.
If I wanted you dead, you would be.
I beg you,
forgive my foolishness.
I was not well in the head.
How does your head feel now?
Ready for whatever service
you require, my lord.
Good.
I require you to kill someone.
Who is it, my lord?
The Emperor Valentinian.
It's all arranged. You'll be gone
before anyone knows.
Ten gold talents now,
ten after it's done.
A fortune.
- I'll be a hunted man forever.
- No, no, no.
The Emperor's mother herself
will protect you.
She's tasted power.
She doesn't want to give it up.
Her seal.
She gave it to me for this purpose.
Keep it with you.
If you're taken,
it'll be your protection.
Tomorrow noon, the Garden of Corona.
Use the south gate.
I'll see that he's alone.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Halt.
How dare you raise a weapon
against the Emperor!
I was walking by.
Thought he looked out of place.
Thank God I followed him!
What are you doing here?
I had an invitation from Mummy
to have a picnic.
See if you can find out who he is.
He carries my mother's seal.
How is that possible?
She invited me here...to be killed.
No. Your own mother?
I should have known!
All this talk
of teaching me to be emperor
was just to keep me off guard!
I'll have that bitch boiled alive.
No, no, no. Sire.
- You have no proof.
- Her seal!
She'll say it was stolen
or she loaned it someone.
She'll have an explanation.
Trust me. I know how she works.
Yes.
You've been
her victim too, haven't you?
- All those years in prison.
- I am not important.
Rome is, and you are Rome.
Act wisely.
- What must I do?
- For now, nothing.
When she finds out her scheme
has failed, she'll lay low.
We'll take care of her
when the time is right.
I put myself in your hands.
Attila, walk with Galen
in the woods.
I'm tired.
A short walk with your friend.
You won't regret it.
Woman...
Where are you?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Go back.
If my brother misses you,
you'll be punished.
I don't care.
Go back.
Valentinian,
tell me what Rome is.
A great city, a great country.
Rome is a fire...
a golden flame of power,
of majesty, beauty, knowledge.
For a thousand years,
she has been the light of the world.
Go outside.
Look around you.
The Colosseum, the Senate,
Forum, theaters, markets, aqueducts,
that bring water from 100 miles away
so we can live like civilized
men instead of animals.
Of course, you're saying
that Rome is rich,
and we have to keep it that way.
That's right.
Tomorrow, I'll go to Ravenna and
take command of the Third Legion.
It's two weeks' march
to the Hun border.
I'll need Senate approval tonight.
- Tonight? They're all asleep.
- You are the emperor.
Wake them up.
Yes!
I will enjoy that.
Darling, I haven't seen you all day.
Valentinian?
Thank you. It's proved very useful.
I'm finished with it now.
Attila, you still want to go to Rome?
If you're serious, yes.
I'm serious. Then again, perhaps you
won't need to go to Rome after all.
I received a message.
It seems that Rome
is coming here, tomorrow.
We know of your incursion
into our territory.
Officially, I protest.
But that's not my true purpose.
Our spies bring word that
the Goths plan to move against us.
- Which tribe?
- The Visigoths west of the Rhine.
Why not march your legion there?
For your sake, Rua,
and the sake of our friendship.
Our spies tell us the Visigoths
plan to move against you as well.
They've been paying tribute
to us for, uh...
- Ten years.
- Ten years.
And they hate you for it.
Just as they hate us. They'll attack
you first to secure their rear,
then us while we sit here
quibbling over a few border villages.
He is of your tribe?
The Visigoths tortured him.
My spies saw it.
Knowing the horse
is sacred to the Hun,
they carved ten horses into his body
with heated knives,
one for each year of tribute.
It took him three days to die!
There should be more blood.
These wounds were made after death.
Perhaps not by the Visigoths.
A Roman general has better things
to do than mutilate corpses.
You've grown soft.
The Huns I knew
would avenge such an insult.
I came to offer an alliance.
I'll march
against the Visigoths alone.
Flavius!
We, uh, divide the spoils equally?
Of course.
We'll join you.
Make preparations, now!
Who was the outspoken one?
My nephew, Attila.
Attila? I've heard of him.
Yes. He's very ambitious.
Why, the other day,
he spoke of invading Rome.
Did he?
I raised him and his brother
since they were children.
They hated each other
from the first.
There is the source
of their latest conflict.
A slave girl?
Bleda claimed her
just to spite Attila.
If they don't fight over her,
they'll find some other reason.
Why not put Attila under my command?
You'd have peace for a time,
at any rate.
They march well, but can they fight?
I sense you'd rather fight
against us than with us.
I've seen much Roman arrogance
but little Roman power.
Sentries are set, General. The
enemy is a league west of the Rhine.
Wake the camp
after the third watch, quietly.
We'll occupy the rise at dawn.
- The Huns will cut off any retreat.
- Yes, General.
The dead man in Rua's tent...
The Visigoths
had nothing to do with it.
And you handled it very badly.
You should have waited
till I was gone,
and you should have seemed puzzled.
"If he were tortured while alive,
why isn't there more blood?"
Rua realizes the answer for himself
and is more likely to believe it.
Trickery and deceit...
That's the way of the Romans,
not of the Huns.
Which way rules the world?
A Frankish tribe must have
joined the Visigoths overnight.
- We've just seen their standards.
- How many?
Their numbers have doubled.
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, Father.
- They have the high ground.
- Yes.
But have they realized yet
what they're up against?
At the first trumpet, the center
falls back, feigns a retreat.
The second, they turn and fight.
The third,
the Huns attack the enemy flank.
Yes, General.
Take the message to Attila.
He attacks at the third trumpet.
Yes, General.
Prepare for the charge.
Sound the first trumpet.
They're retreating.
Roman cowards.
No. It's a trick.
Sound the second trumpet.
The courier was killed.
- His body was found a furlong away.
- Send another.
I did. But he
won't get there in time.
He'll expect us to attack the flank.
He sent no orders.
Attack on my signal.
Go! Go!
With a few more like him, Rome could
conquer the world all over again.
Theodoric.
It's been a long time,
Flavius Aetius.
But the same result -
a Roman victory.
- Your terms?
- A third of your men sold as slaves,
one half your fall harvest.
Do you mean to starve us?
Would you prefer my legions
burn the entire harvest?
You would never dare
without the Huns at your back.
Do you accept the terms,
or shall hostilities continue?
I accept the terms.
Aetius. The girl is well?
I told you before.
Lydia is no concern
of yours and never will be.
You knew each other from before?
Theodoric?
Yes, our paths have crossed.
You hate each other.
Strange as it may seem, we
were once married to the same woman.
She died years ago. He blames me.
So this fight was for Rome...
and to settle a grudge of your own.
I strive for efficiency.
You Romans play with kings and
nations as a child plays with toys.
I go back to Rome soon.
Come with me.
Learn how the world is ruled.
See if Rome really does play with
nations as though they were toys.
There's no one like you in Rome
and no one like me here.
Today was just the beginning.
We could do great things
together, you and I.
If we don't kill each other first.
What do you say, Attila?
Will you come?
Aetius, we congratulate you
on a great victory.
The glory is yours, Caesar.
I present Attila,
whose courage and skill contributed
greatly to our conquest.
Attila, we welcome you
as an ally and a friend.
Let me introduce you
to some of our leading statesmen.
Gentlemen, this is Attila.
He's quite striking,
in a primitive way.
His clothes are made of animal skins.
He'll have them off soon enough.
Was it wise to bring him here?
One day he'll be king
of the Huns' most powerful tribe.
Then we should kill him.
Then we'd be at war with the Huns,
just what we're trying to avoid.
- Won't his elder brother be king?
- Attila will be king.
Therefore, we'll seduce him with
wealth and treat him as a friend.
And at the end
of all your scheming,
- if he turns against us...
- He will not.
It will be on your head, Aetius.
Grachia, congratulations
on your latest victory.
Kind of Your Grace to take note.
And this must be Attila.
Grachia is the current champion
of the Circus Maximus.
- Finest charioteer in the empire.
- Come and watch me race.
I'll make sure you have
the finest seat.
A chariot driver at a royal banquet?
It's shameful how this city
fawns over athletes.
Some of them
have more money than I do.
It suits you nicely.
I wear it tonight only.
- I have another present.
- It's not necessary.
I insist.
What is this place?
A bath.
Go on, step in.
You've never seen one?
Aetius has only shown you
fortresses and aqueducts,
but I think the bath
is Rome's greatest achievement.
It's hot.
Yes.
That's the point.
How's it done?
A furnace, a few pipes.
It doesn't matter.
It's very soothing
once you get used to the heat.
I had a feeling you might like it.
I'm not as stupid as people think...
as you probably think.
It's just that brains don't
do a woman much good in Rome.
Mummy's an exception.
She had real power.
But she's made sure
that I never will.
She favors my brother and has done
since the day he was born.
He's a hopeless ninny,
but he's a man.
So that's that.
I say, if a woman can only
have power through a man,
then let it be with the most
powerful man she can find.
-  Rua grows old.
- What do you want me to do?
He likes to drink ale
in the mid morning.
Put this in the bowl
next to his bed.
He will die peacefully,
and you will live well.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I have other things
to tend to besides you.
I need mushrooms for my potions.
Besides, Bleda hardly
touches you any more, anyway.
Galen, wait.
He's planning to have Rua murdered.
Be quiet!
You could be killed
for saying that, and I for hearing.
Bleda bribed a guard to poison him.
I heard them.
You have to do something.
- What can I do?
- Warn Rua.
- He wouldn't listen to me.
- Then use your powers.
It may be best for us if Rua dies.
And Bleda becomes king?
- Where is Attila?
- Rome.
- How long has he been there?
- Weeks.
Why does he tarry?
I don't know.
If there's one thing
that will bring him back,
it's news of Rua's death.
Attila must return.
You love him.
A woman who does not is blind.
But he would never love a toadstool.
- Why do you help me?
- You're in my visions.
I must be true to them,
and my visions tell me
Attila is in danger.
He must return. Therefore,
let today's king die
that tomorrow's may live.
When you said Rome would seduce him,
I didn't know you meant my daughter.
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It cannot continue.
A marriage
would formalize the alliance.
Married to a barbarian?
She'd be a laughing stock.
I doubt it. But at least there'd be
a Rome to do the laughing.
Spare me your speech
about sacrifices for the empire.
- Like it or not, we must make them.
- She's not yours to barter with.
An alliance with the Huns
will secure our borders,
and buy us time to make
ourselves great again.
If he'll have her, they will marry.
Over my dead body.
Well, if you insist.
He puts too much faith
in his influence over Attila.
Even if this marriage occurred
the Huns might think it
a great joke to attack us anyway.
- It must not occur.
- The girl is obsessed.
It may require drastic measures.
Then take them.
And Aetius
has outlived his usefulness.
I understand.
I never believed in destiny before,
but I do now.
It was destiny
that brought us together.
Do you believe in destiny, Attila?
- Perhaps.
- Good.
So many people
are so boringly virtuous.
"The will of God" this
and "the will of God" that.
Actually, I only know
one other person
who really takes destiny seriously.
Flavius Aetius.
Strange, isn't it?
I despise him but adore you.
- What's his destiny?
- To save Rome, he says.
And what's yours?
A soothsayer in my village
says I'll find a sword.
And when you find it?
I'll rule the world.
How sad for Aetius.
Aetius can take care of himself.
If you'll excuse me.
- What do you think of her?
- She's pleasing.
That's all?
What else is there to say of a woman?
You've never loved, then.
Once. Perhaps.
The slave girl, the red-haired one.
A man in your position
can have as many women as you wish.
Those that you love...
and those that are merely...
useful.
And if your destiny
is to conquer the world,
you could do worse
than ally yourself with Rome.
What if Rome is part of the world
I'm meant to conquer?
Well, there are many ways to conquer.
You captured Honoria
without striking a blow,
and she may be the key
to your next conquest.
To conquest, however achieved.
Father, this message
was brought to the villa.
Rua is dead.
- I must leave at once.
- It's a bad season for travel.
Bleda will be plotting against me.
Get a fresh start in the morning.
I'll send an escort.
Send a messenger
to announce your return,
but take a different route
to make assassination difficult.
Challenge him quickly,
and have a reason besides ambition.
- A pretext.
- Exactly.
For example, you might
accuse him of murdering Rua.
- The fact is, he probably did.
- I have no proof.
It's no matter. It's good politics.
It'll put him on the defensive.
Attila...
if things go badly, you know
you may always seek shelter here.
I will live or die among the Huns.
Then rest.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Have you been eavesdropping?
No, learning.
You'll miss him, won't you?
Yes, I'll miss him.
Rome produces
few such men these days.
This Bleda,
will he really try to kill him?
Of course.
I'll say a prayer for him
before I go to sleep.
Yes.
Say one for Rome as well.
Oh, I beg pardon, master.
I thought you were leaving.
Take him!
Take him! Your king commands it!
You are not yet king.
Bring me my crown! Quickly!
You see how he wants to steal
the crown, as he stole Rua's life?
You lie.
Rua should have died as he lived.
A warrior, not in his sleep.
No man can choose
the manner of his own death.
- No, not if he's murdered.
- Rua died without issue,
and I am the elder son
of his brother.
Therefore, I am the rightful king.
To what purpose? To be paid
for fighting in the service of Rome
or some other nation?
We will live
as Huns have always lived.
What else should we do?
We should rule the world!
You'd have us attack Rome?
No.
He has been bought off.
Besides, he has a whore in Rome
who calls herself a princess.
If we attack Rome,
we leave our flanks open.
We will return
to find our villages burned
and our women gone.
You've said
what we should not do,
but you've not said
what we should do.
Attack north... Pannonia and beyond.
- Attack our own people?!
- Not of our tribe.
But Huns nonetheless,
and we've been at peace
for many years.
And war will come again,
as it always has.
You all know the ancient prophecy.
A conqueror will rise among us.
The one who finds
the war god's sword.
Have you found this sword?
No.
Then your words are empty.
I will give a different sign.
I say you murdered Rua,
and are not fit to take his place.
And I say you lie.
Then we'll meet tomorrow
when the sun awakens.
Let the strongest prevail.
And that will be the sign.
He will tip his arrows with poison.
If I die of poison, the tribe
will kill him. He knows that.
This poison leaves no sign.
How would Bleda get such a poison?
You?
Galen...
What evil have you worked for him?
Did he poison Rua?
Bleda swore he'd kill me
if I didn't help.
Besides, I knew it would
bring you back from Rome.
- I would have come back anyway!
- My visions...
- Your visions!
- I was right to do what I did.
This time tomorrow you'll be king.
- Give me some of your poison!
- I have none.
There are no more mushrooms.
I've been looking for weeks.
Then you've not only killed Rua,
you've killed me.
No. If the poison enters you,
I'll draw it out.
How? Will you be riding next to me
on a horse of your own?
Attila, find the sword.
If you have the sword,
nothing can touch you.
Nobody has found it
in a hundred years.
How am I supposed to find it
before sunrise?
I'm through with you, woman.
Never speak to me again.
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!
Powers of earth and sky, be true
to the visions you have shown me.
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.
Hyah!
Hah!
Ha. Ha.
Give Galen's strength to Attila
and Attila's pain to Galen.
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hah!
Attila! Attila! Attila!
