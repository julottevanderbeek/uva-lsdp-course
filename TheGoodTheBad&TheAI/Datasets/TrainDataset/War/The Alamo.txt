GENERAL HOUSTON'S ARRIVED,
GENTLEMEN.
REFRESHMENTS ?
THANK YOU, DOC.
SEVENTY-ONE COLD, WINDY,
RUMP-BUMPING MILES
SINCE YESTERDAY.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY, LIGHTFOOT.
COMPANY ADVANCE !
ATTEN-HUT !
THAT IS ALL.
YOUR PARDON,
GENERAL HOUSTON.  MAY I
ORDER THE MEN TO BIVOUAC ?
THESE LAST TWO
FORCED MARCHES RATHER
TOOK IT OUT OF THEM.
THE FOOT SOLDIERS MAY.
FEED THE OTHERS,
CARE FOR THEIR HORSES...
AND TELL THEM
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER
FORCED MARCH WITHIN THE HOUR.
YES, SIR.  SERGEANT,
COME WITH ME !
YES, SIR !
DOCTOR.
DICKINSON.
SAM.
GENERAL, SIR.
GENERAL, IT AIN'T
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
BUT YOU AIN'T ATE
SINCE YESTERDAY.
I'LL SET IT
ON THE TABLE HERE.
WHERE'S JIM BOWIE ?
WHEN CERTAIN PEOPLE AIN'T ATE,
THEY'RE MEANER THAN A BOBCAT.
MR. DICKINSON,
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
WHERE'S JIM BOWIE ?
HE'S INDISPOSED, SIR.
INDISPOSED.
BY GOD, IF YOU MEAN DRUNK,
YOU SAY DRUNK, SIR.
HE'S DRUNK, SIR.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
JAMES BUTLER BONHAM,
IN TRAVIS'S COMMAND,
SIR.
NEIL, YOU GO NORTH
WITH ME.
COLONEL TRAVIS WILL BE
IN COMMAND HERE.
MAJOR, SIR.
COLONEL TRAVIS, I'LL SEND
THE COMMISSION THROUGH.
THANK YOU, GENERAL.
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT
I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY--
YOU CAN DISPENSE WITH
THE AMENITIES, COLONEL.
NOW...
I'VE BEEN GIVEN COMMAND
OF THE ARMIES OF TEXAS,
BUT THE FLY IN THE BUTTERMILK
IS THERE AIN'T NO ARMIES
IN TEXAS.
A FEW GOOD FRIENDS
AND SOME WILLING MEN.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO KNOCK SOME
OF THOSE MEN INTO AN ARMY,
AND TO DO THAT
I NEED TIME.
YOU PEOPLE RIGHT HERE
ON THE RIO GRANDE ARE GONNA
HAVE TO BUY ME THAT TIME.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP SANTA ANNA
OFF THE BACK OF MY NECK...
UNTIL I CAN GET
IN SHAPE TO FIGHT HIM.
GENERAL,
I ASSUME YOU'RE
ORDERING ME TO--
DAMN IT !  I AM ORDERING YOU
TO COMMAND.  HOW AND WHAT
YOU DO IS YOUR PROBLEM.
BUT, SAM,
WHAT ABOUT JIM BOWIE ?
JIM BOWIE,
AS MR. BONHAM HAS
INFORMED US, IS INDISPOSED.
YES, SIR, BUT I'D LIKE
TO POINT OUT, SIR,
THAT JIM BOWIE IS LEADING
A HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS,
WHEREAS YOUNG TRAVIS HERE
COMMANDS LESS THAN 30 REGULARS.
TWENTY-SEVEN.
GENERAL HOUSTON,
I THINK WE OUGHT TO
DISCUSS THIS MATTER.
CLEAR THE ROOM.
GENTLEMEN, I WOULD HAVE
A WORD WITH MR. TRAVIS,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
MR. TRAVIS,
WERE YOU GOING TO COMPLAIN
TO ME ABOUT JIM BOWIE ?
NOT COMPLAIN, SIR.
OF COURSE JIM BOWIE'S DRUNK.
HE TOOK THIS TOWN
FROM GENERAL COZ.
HE FOUGHT A BATTLE AND NOW
HE'S DRUNK.  THAT SEEMS
KIND OF NATURAL TO ME.
OR PERHAPS YOU QUESTION
SOMETHING OTHER THAN
BOWIE'S DRINKING ?
YOU GONNA TELL ME
THAT HE'S GOT A LOT
OF ACREAGE AROUND HERE ?
THAT HE'S MARRIED INTO
THE MEXICAN ARISTOCRACY ?
YES, SIR.
MR. TRAVIS, I WOULD TRUST
JIM BOWIE WITH MY LIFE.
MORE THAN THAT
I WOULD TRUST HIM WITH
THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY,
AND MORE THAN THAT
I WOULD TRUST HIM
WITH THE LIFE OF TEXAS.
SIR.  YES, SIR.
THAT'S ALL, TRAVIS.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO LIKE YOU,
BUT YOU ARE ANOTHER ONE OF
THE VERY FEW MEN I WOULD TRUST
WITH THE LIFE OF TEXAS.
FOR THAT,
THANK YOU, SIR.
AND IT MAY VERY WELL BE...
THAT THAT LIFE RESTS
IN YOUR HANDS NOW.
JETHRO, IS THAT YOU ?
YES, SIR, GENERAL,
THIS IS ME.
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE ?
YOU HAD WHITE HAIR WHEN
I WAS LITTLE AND NOW WE LOOK
LIKE WE'RE THE SAME AGE.
YES, SIR,
BUT I BEEN A TEMPERATE
AND GOD-FEARING MAN...
ALL MY LIFE, SIR.
WELL, I GUESS
MY PAST IS OUT.
NOW, JETHRO, YOU TELL
YOUR MR. JIM I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT HIS ILLNESS.
I WISH HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY
AND ASSURE HIM OF
MY UNDYING AFFECTION.
YES, SIR.
AND GENERAL SAM, SIR,
HE LOVE YOU TOO,
AND THEM WORDS OF YOURS
GONNA PUT HIM RIGHT BACK
ON HIS FEET.
I HEARD.
- IN THE STOMACH.
- STAY TEMPERATE,
OLD MAN.  NEIL !
COLUMN RIGHT !
FORWARD !  YO HO !
TAKE CARE, MEN.
YOU ALL RIGHT, MR. JIM ?
YEAH.
SIT DOWN, JETH.
OOH !
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING,
SIR ?
NO, NO,
YOU JUST SIT THERE.
HOUSTON'S GONE ?
YES, SIR.
COME AND GONE,
AND ME LYING DRUNK.
WELL--
COLONEL TRAVIS !
BOWIE'S APPROACHING !
HALT !
CARRY ON, SENTRY !
RECALL
WORK PARTIES !
PREPARE FOR
FLAG CEREMONY !
DETAIL, FORWARD MARCH !
HALT, HO.
DETAIL, HALT.
ABOUT FACE.
PRESENT... ARMS.
WE STAND HERE,
READY TO DO OUR DUTY...
AND COGNIZANT
OF THE WILL OF GOD.
CAPTAIN DICKINSON,
DISMISS THE CEREMONY !
OH, AND CAPTAIN,
YOU WILL INFORM THE MEN
THAT WORK DETAILS WILL BE
DISMISSED AT 4:30...
IN ORDER THAT FAMILY MEN
MAY GATHER THEIR DEPENDENTS
WITHIN THESE WALLS.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR !
YES, SIR.
YOU MEN WILL FOLLOW ME.
JETH.  BLAKE'LL SHOW YOU TO
OUR QUARTERS.  SET 'EM UP.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
COLONEL BOWIE.
SANTA ANNA'S GOT AN ARMY
OF 7,000 MEN.
SO ?
YOU AIN'T GONNA TRY TO DEFEND
THIS BROKEN-DOWN CHURCH...
AGAINST 7,000
BATTLE-HARD TROOPS ?
COLONEL BOWIE,
YOU WERE DRUNK
AT THE LAST OFFICERS' CALL,
AND I WOULD RATHER POSTPONE
OUR DISCUSSION UNTIL THE NEXT,
AT WHICH TIME
I WILL EXPLAIN MY PLANS...
AND GIVE ORDERS
FOR THE IMPLEMENTING
OF THOSE PLANS.
HEY, JIM, WHY DO WE
HAVE TO WORK LIKE THIS ?
I VOLUNTEERED TO FIGHT,
NOT BUILD NO FORT.  HOW COME
WE HAVE TO WORK LIKE THIS ?
BECAUSE OLD SAM
TOLD TRAVIS,
TRAVIS TOLD ME
AND I'M TELLING YOU.
SOMEBODY'S COMING,
HELLBENT FOR LEATHER,
SINKING SPURS AT EVERY JUMP.
HALT !
RIGHT THERE.
CORPORAL OF THE GUARD,
POST NUMBER ONE.
NO CIVILIANS MAY ENTER THE FORT,
SENOR SEGUIN.  I'M SORRY.
- LET 'EM THROUGH, DICK.
- CAPTAIN DICKINSON.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
GOOD AFTERNOON, COLONEL TRAVIS.
WE HAVE NEWS OF SANTA ANNA.
MY SON AND I--
SENOR, SURELY YOU
SHOULD REALIZE...
THAT EVEN THOUGH
YOU ARE THE ALCALDE
OF SAN ANTONIO DE BEXAR,
IT DOES NOT EXEMPT YOU
FROM MILITARY PROHIBITIONS.
I'M VERY SORRY,
COLONEL TRAVIS.
HAD I KNOWN YOUR RESTRICTIONS
APPLIED TO ME AND MY FAMILY,
SIR, I WOULD NOT--
WAIT A MINUTE, TRAVIS.
THE SEGUINS HAVE GOT
NEWS OF SANTA ANNA.
- WE HAVE A DOZEN RUMORS A DAY.
- WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST--
JUAN, TELL HIM.
COLONEL, THE INDIANS
OF SAN BLAS...
THEY SAY LARGE NUMBERS
OF SOLDIERS CROSSED
THE BAJA DIABLO TWO DAYS AGO.
THAT PUTS THEM A LOT CLOSER
THAN YOU THOUGHT.
GO AHEAD, JUAN.
THE INDIANS GUESSED
THE NUMBER OF TROOPS
AT OVER 5,000.
THERE ARE ALSO LARGE NUMBERS
OF MOUNTED SOLDIERS
AND SUPPLY TRAINS.
ALSO, LOWER DOWN
ON THE BAJA DIABLO,
ANOTHER PARTY OF INDIANS
SAW SIGNS OF LARGE NUMBERS
OF SHOT HORSES--
BUT AS A CIVILIAN YOU CANNOT
REALIZE HOW WORTHLESS THIS SORT
OF INFORMATION IS.
SOME INDIAN TOLD SOME
VAQUEROS !  BUT ANYWAY,
THANK YOU, SIR, AND GOOD DAY.
YOU KNOW THE SEGUINS
ARE ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.
BUT I CANNOT MAKE
A PLAN OF ACTION BASED
ON THIRDHAND RUMORS.
I DO NOT TAKE
PERSONAL AFFRONT,
COLONEL TRAVIS,
ELSE I SHOULD BE FORCED
TO ACT OTHER THAN TO
SIMPLY BID YOU GOOD DAY.
ADIOS, JUAN.
YOU'RE A DAMN FOOL,
TRAVIS.
I DISLIKE BEING
RUDE TO HIM.
BUT I HAD TO DO IT,
DICK.
I'D SAY WE HAVE TWO OR,
AT BEST, THREE DAYS
BEFORE WE SEE HIS BANNERS.
THE MEN WERE LISTENING,
AND I CAN'T LET
THAT RABBLE KNOW...
HOW WEAK WE ARE
AND HOW STRONG THE ENEMY IS.
YOU COULDN'T
DO THAT, EH ?
NO, I COULDN'T.
MY HONEST AND TRUTHFUL
AND PLAINSPOKEN FRIEND.
YOU COULD PERHAPS,
BUT I COULDN'T.
NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THIS--
THIS OBLIQUE RAMPART HERE.
WELL, HAVE SENSE, DICK.
WHY SHOULD THOSE
MEN STAY IF THEY KNEW
THE TRUTH OF OUR SITUATION ?
IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR BOWIE, OF COURSE.
HE'S GOT A BIG STAKE IN TEXAS--
A COUPLE OF MILLION ACRES,
I HEAR.  BUT SOME OF THOSE MEN--
YOU GOT ANY DOLLARS
OR ACRES ?
I'VE GOT AN EXTRA
SUIT OF CLOTHES.
YOU KNOW THAT.
BOY.
SO THAT'S IT.
SAN ANTONIO DE BEXAR.
IT MEANS "ST. ANTHONY"
IN ENGLISH.  THE COLONEL
SPEAKS SPANISH, YOU KNOW.
YOU GONNA PRAY, SIR ?
BUT WHY, SIR ?
I MEAN, THERE WASN'T
NO DOUBT WE'D FIND HER.
THE COLONEL JUST WASN'T SURE
WHICH ONE OF THESE CREEKS
WAS THE SHORTEST CUT.
HE AIN'T BEEN HERE
IN NIGH 15 YEARS.
YOU'D BETTER MAKE THE SIGNAL.
YES, SIR.
I HOPE THIS POWDER
AIN'T DAMP.
YOU DON'T TAKE IT WRONG
I ASK YOU ALL THESE
QUESTIONS, PARSON ?
NO, BOY, THAT'S HOW
YOU LEARN-- ASKING.
YES, SIR.
BUT SO MANY TIMES
EVERY DAY YOU STOP
AND GIVE THANKS,
AND MOSTLY I CAN'T
CATCH ON TO WHAT YOU'RE
THANKING THE LORD FOR.
I MEAN, THERE'S
NOTHING SPECIAL.
I GIVE THANKS FOR
THE TIME AND THE PLACE.
THE TIME AND PLACE, PARSON ?
A TIME TO LIVE
AND A PLACE TO DIE--
THAT'S ALL ANY MAN GETS.
NO MORE, NO LESS.
FIRE THE SIGNAL, BOY.
YES, SIR.
MUST BE PARSON
AND THE BOY !
THINK SO.
WELL, THERE SHE BE,
COLONEL, AFTER 20 DAYS
OF HARD RIDING.
IT'S NO FORT,
IT'S AN OLD MISSION.
YOU BETTER TAKE A BETTER LOOK.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
MOVING IN THERE.
THEM GUNS DON'T GIVE IT
NO MISSION LOOK TO ME.
COLONEL, WHAT DO...
C-A-N-T-I-N-A SPELL ?
CANTINA.  DO IT MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT DO ?
IT DO.
IT MEANS OUT OF THESE DEERSKINS
AND INTO OUR FOOFARAW.
HEY, YOU GOT MY COAT !
HEY, PEDRO,
HAND ME DOWN THAT GUITAR.
NOW I WANT YOU FOLKS
TO ALL CLUMP IN HERE
CLOSE TOGETHER.
I WANT YOU TEXICANS
TO OPEN UP YOUR EARS...
AND LISTEN TO
A LITTLE PURE TENNESSEE.
¶ HERE'S TO THE LADIES
I LOVE 'EM ALL ¶
¶ HERE'S TO THE ONES
I RECALL ¶
¶ HERE'S TO THE LADIES
MARRIED OR FREE ¶
¶ THEY ALL LOOK
PRETTY GOOD TO ME ¶
¶ THE BIG AND SMALL ONES
THE SHORT AND TALL ONES ¶
¶¶
HALT !
CAPTAIN DICKINSON,
SPLIT YOUR PATROL...
AND SEND HALF EACH WAY DOWN
THE RIVER FOR ABOUT FIVE MILES
TO LOOK FOR ANY SIGNS.
THEN REPORT BACK TO
THE MISSION.
YES, SIR.
FORWARD, YO !
SORRY, SIR.
SHE SORTA COME LOOSE.
I'D LIKE--
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO DAVID CROCKETT.
YOU DID.
WAS DAVID CROCKETT
FROM TENNESSEE ?
YES, SIR,
AND I OUGHT TO KNOW.
ME AND HIM'S
NEIGHBORS BACK HOME.
ONLY LIVE 40 MILES APART.
ARE YOU DAVID CROCKETT,
SIR ?
THAT'S MY NAME.
I'M COLONEL TRAVIS,
COMMANDER OF THE GARRISON.
I FIGURED.  WELL, SON,
YOU BETTER START GROWING UP.
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU
ON A MATTER OF
GRAVEST IMPORTANCE.
SURE.
LET'S FIND A CORNER.
TALKING'S DRY WORK.
YOU'RE LEARNING FAST.
COLONEL,
I'M RESIGNING FROM YOU.
I'M GONNA MARRY UP
WITH CONCHITA AND BE
THE MAN OF THIS HOUSE.
A KISS,
SENORITA.
I TOSS AROUND
A MESS OF THAT
PROUD SPANISH TOO.
MOST IMPORTANT PART.
LET'S JIG A LITTLE,
MAMACITA.
LIGHT THERE AND REST EASY,
TRAVIS,
WHILE I BED DOWN THIS BUCK.
HE JUST AIN'T GOT
NO HEAD FOR WHISKEY.
PARSON !
YEAH, DAVY.
TAKE HIM AWAY.
YES, SIR.
LET'S WET OUR WHISTLES.
WORDS ARE DUSTY.
I DON'T DRINK.
NOT EVER ?
NO.
I'VE HEARD OF SUCH.
WELL, SPREAD YOUR WAMPUM,
TRAVIS.
MY TITLE IS COLONEL.
ME, I'M A COLONEL TOO.
WOULDN'T IT SOUND KINDA SILLY,
THE TWO OF US CHATTERING
"COLONEL, COLONEL, COLONEL"...
LIKE A COUPLE OF
MARSH SHIELD BIRDS ?
JUST SPEAK RIGHT UP
AND CALL ME CROCKETT.
DON'T BOTHER TO USE MY TITLE.
OLD DRUNKEN GENERAL FLATFORD
GAVE IT TO ME IN
THE CHOCTAW INDIAN WAR.
I'LL CALL YOU TRAVIS.
VERY WELL, CROCKETT.
I'D LIKE YOUR PERMISSION
TO MAKE A SPEECH
TO YOUR MEN.
WELL, THEY'VE HEARD
MANY A SPEECH WHILE
I WAS "CONGRESSIFYING."
WHAT WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT ?
OH, ABOUT FREEDOM
AND LIBERTY.
WELL, THEY DON'T
NEED ANY SUCH SPEECH.
THESE MEN
ARE FROM TENNESSEE.
BUT I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN
WHY I WANT THEM TO VOLUNTEER
TO FIGHT AGAINST SANTA ANNA.
OH ?
THEY ARE--
NOT SO CARELESS.
YOU CAN'T GET NEW CLOTHES
THIS SIDE OF NACOGDOCHES.
¶¶
TAG !
OOF !
TENNESSEANS AIN'T EXACTLY
AGAINST FIGHTING,
BUT THEY AIN'T MUCH
FOR LISTENING TO SPEECHES.
WHAT WOULD
YOU TELL 'EM ?
OF THE MANY AND UNENDURABLE
HARDSHIPS THE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO...
UNDER THE TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT
OF THIS MILITARY DICTATOR,
SANTA ANNA.
WE HAVE NO RIGHTS IN
THE COURTS, NO MARKET
FOR OUR PRODUCE.
HE HAS FORBIDDEN TRADE
WITH THE NORTH.
DAVY...
I WANT A CHANCE
FOR MY MONEY BACK.
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE DAVY ALONE ?
HE DONE BEAT YOU
THIRTY-SIX.
THIRTY-EIGHT.
OOF !
THIRTY-SIX.
THIS'LL ONLY TAKE
A MINUTE, TRAVIS.
GIVE ME THEM FEATHERS.
GENTLEMEN...
BALANCE YOUR FEATHERS.
GET SET.  GO.
GOT YA THAT TIME,
DAVY.
IT WAS FAIR AND SQUARE.
NOW, IF WE COULD CONTINUE,
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY--
ONE MINUTE, TRAVIS.
THAT WAS JUST FOR
WHO GETS FIRST CHANCE.
PREPARE YOURSELF,
DAVY.
I'M PREPARED.
HE'S STILL ON HIS FEET.
OH, NO.
OH, YES !
OH, YES,
AND IT'S MY TURN.
THIRTY-NINE,
EH, DAVY ?
SEEMS LIKE.
HE'LL NEVER LEARN.
LET'S GET A BUCKET OF WATER.
KIND OF A GAME THE BOYS PLAY
BACK IN TENNESSEE.
EVEN THOUGH TIME IS
RUNNING OUT, I FEEL I MUST
POSTPONE THIS INTERVIEW...
UNTIL WE CAN BE ASSURED
OF NO FURTHER INTERRUPTIONS.
YOU DON'T GET LARD
LESS'N YOU BOIL THE HOG.
HAVE ONE OF THESE CIGARS.
I BROUGHT 'EM ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW ORLEANS.
WERE YOU GONNA
TELL MY TENNESSEANS...
THAT A GOOD MANY MEN,
SOUND MEN ALL,
HAD A PLOT TO EASE
THE SUFFERING OF THE PEOPLE
IN THESE PARTS ?
OR WERE YOU GOING TO TELL THEM
THAT STEVE AUSTIN,
HOUSTON AND OTHERS--
AND YOU TOO, TRAVIS--
ARE PLANNING TO DECLARE
FOR A REPUBLIC ?
TO DECLARE THIS
THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS ?
WERE YOU GONNA TELL 'EM THAT,
TRAVIS ?
I HADN'T THOUGHT THIS
WAS GENERALLY KNOWN.
OH, IT ISN'T YET--
NOT TILL AUSTIN SEPARATES
THE SHEEP FROM THE GOATS.
NOT TILL HE DECIDES
WHO'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
"REPUBLIC."
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THE WORD.
IT MEANS PEOPLE CAN
LIVE FREE, TALK FREE.
GO OR COME, BUY OR SELL,
BE DRUNK OR SOBER,
HOWEVER THEY CHOOSE.
THE SAME TIGHTNESS A MAN GETS
WHEN HIS BABY TAKES HIS
FIRST STEP,
OR HIS FIRST BABY SHAVES...
AND MAKES HIS FIRST SOUND
LIKE A MAN.
SOME WORDS CAN GIVE YOU
A FEELING THAT
MAKE YOUR HEART WARM.
REPUBLIC IS ONE
OF THOSE WORDS.
CROCKETT...
I HAVE, I BELIEVE,
LEARNED TWO THINGS
ABOUT YOU.
WORTHWHILE, I HOPE.
YOU'RE NOT THE ILLITERATE
COUNTRY BUMPKIN YOU WOULD
HAVE PEOPLE BELIEVE.
YOU SPEAK AN EXCELLENT
AND CONCISE ENGLISH
WHEN YOU WISH.
THE BAD GRAMMAR
IS A POSE.
WELL, A FELLOW
HAS TO DO A LOT OF THINGS
TO GET ELECTED TO CONGRESS.
I'VE KISSED
MANY A BABY TOO.
THE OTHER IS THAT YOU CAME
TO TEXAS TO FIGHT WITH US.
DON'T TELL MY
TENNESSEANS THAT.
THEY THINK WE CAME SOUTH
TO HUNT AND GET DRUNK.
THEY SEEM TO HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED THAT.
GOOD EVENING,
MY ALMOST VANISHING LADY.
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
I HAVE ARRANGED FOR
THIS CARRIAGE TO TAKE ME--
I WOULD BE HEARTBROKEN
IF YOU LEFT BEXAR JUST NOW,
AND EVEN MORE HEARTBROKEN
IF YOU LEFT WITH
MY TEAM OF HORSES,
WHICH WOULD BRING
A PRETTY PENNY
IN THESE TIMES...
WITH TWO FACTIONS BUYING
ANYTHING ON FOUR LEGS.
YOU HAVE BUSINESS HERE ?
PROMISED MOTHER.
YOUR MOTHER ?
PRAY TO THE NORTH STAR.
TEN MINUTES EVERY NIGHT.
LONG LINE
OF STAR WORSHIPPERS.
IT KEEPS
THE RHEUMATISM AWAY.
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE
LOOKIN' FOR TROUBLE.
IT DO ?
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS,
UNLESS YOU PREFER
DISCUSSING YOUR BUSINESS...
IN FRONT OF EVERY
DRUNKEN LOAFER IN BEXAR.
THAT OVERDRESSED IGNORAMUS IS
ONE OF THE RIFFRAFF ASSEMBLING
HERE TO RESIST SANTA ANNA.
HUH !  THEY'LL FIND
GRAVES AND NOTHING ELSE.
SANTA ANNA WILL SWEEP ACROSS--
OVERDRESSED ?
I PAID GOOD MONEY
FOR THESE CLOTHES.
WHY ?
LADY'S LUGGAGE.
GRATUITY FOR THE BOY.
YOU FORGOT.
SON, I GUESS HE
ISN'T GONNA TIP YOU.
ANOTHER THING
I PROMISED MOTHER--
NEVER TO GET INTO
SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE
POINTED GUNS AT ME.
MA'AM, IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT I AM MISTAKEN,
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU FIND
THIS GENTLEMAN'S COMPANY
DISTASTEFUL.
- TELL HIM TO GET OUT.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
BUT THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH
YOU COULD BE OF HELP,
AND I AM IN NO DANGER.
I BID YOU GOOD NIGHT,
MA'AM.
GRATUITY FOR
THE BOY.
YOUR PROPERTY, SIR.
GRACIAS.
TAKE IT EASY,
GRACIELA, EASY !
I SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE,
BUT THAT'S TOO FAST
FOR ME.
THOUGH I DARE SAY,
I'M BETTER OFF
NOT UNDERSTANDING.
YOU ACTUALLY WANTED ME
TO AGREE TO THIS--
THIS ATROCITY ?
I ACTUALLY DID,
AND I ACTUALLY DO.
YOU'RE AN EDUCATED WOMAN,
GRACIELA, INTELLIGENT.
IS THERE ANY
OTHER WAY TO RESTORE
YOUR FAMILY PROPERTIES ?
YOU EXPECT ME
TO MARRY YOU ?
TO MARRY YOU ?
LOGICAL ?
OF COURSE.
I AM ACCEPTABLE TO SANTA ANNA,
AND IF HE SHOULD BE DEFEATED...
- I WILL MANAGE TO BECOME
ACCEPTABLE TO HIS SUCCESSORS.
- OHH !
THAT'S THE TRICK--
TO BE ACCEPTABLE
TO THE POWERS THAT BE.
LET'S NOT PRETEND YOU'RE
A BROKENHEARTED WIDOW.
YOU BARELY KNEW THE MAN.
THAT'S THE WAY
OF MY PEOPLE.
YOU'LL SAY YES.
IT'S YOUR ONLY
POSSIBLE PATH.
LIKE ALL WOMEN,
YOU'LL POSTPONE THE DECISION,
BUT YOU WILL SAY YES.
FORGIVE ME, MA'AM,
BUT I WAS HAVING A SMOKE
OUT ON THAT GALLERY.
I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR--
I WASN'T EAVESDROPPING.
BUT IT RANKLES ME WHEN
SOMEBODY TRIES TO FORCE
SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME
BEFORE TONIGHT, BUT I AM
OFFERING YOU MY SERVICES.
IF THAT FELLA'S
MAKING YOU STAY IN BEXAR,
I'M READY, WILLING AND ABLE
TO PROVIDE YOU WITH TRANSPORT
TO WHEREVER YOU WANT.
AND OTHER THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY
IN BEXAR,
I'M READY,
WILLING AND ABLE TO SEE
THAT HE DON'T BOTHER YOU.
WOULD YOU ANSWER ONE QUESTION
WITH COMPLETE HONESTY,
MR. TALL AMERICAN ?
MA'AM, ONLY MODESTY
RESTRAINS ME FROM
TELLING YOU...
THAT I AM WIDELY KNOWN
FOR MY TRUTHFULNESS.
WOULD YOU SO QUICKLY
OFFER TO DEFEND ME...
IF I WERE 60 YEARS OLD
AND WRINKLED ?
OR IS IT BECAUSE I AM
YOUNG AND A WIDOW,
AND YOU ARE FAR FROM HOME
AND YOUR LOVED ONES ?
BUT THANK YOU ANYWAY,
SIR.
IN ANY EVENT,
THIS IS A MATTER IN WHICH
NO OUTSIDER COULD HELP.
MR. TALL AMERICAN,
I DO BELIEVE THAT
A WOMAN IN TROUBLE,
EVEN THOUGH 60 AND WRINKLED,
COULD TURN TO YOU FOR HELP.
GOOD NIGHT, MA'AM.
HAAH !
WELL, THANKS, FRIEND.
IF YOU DON'T INSIST ON
HAVING THEM TO YOURSELF,
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.
WITH PLEASURE, FRIEND.
YOU MUST BE JIM BOWIE.
THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
IS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS KNIFE...
IS CERTAINLY EVERYTHING
I HEARD IT WAS.
I'M BOWIE.
I'M DAVY CROCKETT.
WELL, I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
YOU TOO.
I'D ADMIRE TO BUY YOU A DRINK,
OR EIGHT OR TEN.
OOP, OOP.  EXCUSE ME.
YOU HAVE SOME TROUBLE
WITH EMIL SAND ?
WHO'S EMIL SAND ?
MERCHANT.
TALL FELLOW,
BUTTER-COLORED HAIR.
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
I'VE HAD SOME WORDS WITH HIM.
INTEND TO HAVE SOME MORE.
HOW ABOUT THAT DRINK ?
HONORED,
CONGRESSMAN CROCKETT.
OH, PLEASE, JIM, DON'T
CALL ME THAT.  I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO LIVE IT DOWN.
HERE'S YOUR EXTRA COAT,
DAVY, AND JUG.
THOUGHTFUL.
YOU BETTER GET
SOME SLEEP, SMITTY.
I'M NOT TIRED.
THIS MEXICO--
EXCITING NIGHT.
YEAH, WELL,
YOU STILL BETTER
GET SOME SLEEP.
ALL RIGHT, DAVY.
GOOD NIGHT, SMITTY.
GOOD NIGHT,
COLONEL BOWIE-- JIM.
TOOK A LONG TIME
FOR THIS NIGHT
TO GET UNEXCITING.
IT SURE DID.
THIS IS A MIGHTY
PRETTY ONE THOUGH.
UNDERSTAND YOU MOVED
DOWN HERE LOCK,
STOCK AND BARREL.
I DIDN'T PLAN ON MOVING.
CAME FOR A VISIT AND STAYED.
GATHER YOU LIKE IT.
OH, DAVY, IF YOU
ONLY KNEW MEXICO.
IT'S WONDERFUL.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A BURNT-OVER DESERT
MOST OF THE TIME.
NAH, MOST NORTHERNERS
THINK THAT.  'TAIN'T SO.
BIG VALLEYS
BETWEEN HIGH MOUNTAINS.
JUST EVERYTHING
A MAN COULD WANT
IN THE WAY OF COUNTRY,
FOR LOOKING AT
OR FOR GROWING ON.
BUT MOSTLY-- MOSTLY
IT'S THE PEOPLE, DAVY.
THEY GOT--
THIS IS KINDA HARD
TO EXPLAIN,
BUT THEY GOT COURAGE
AND THEY GOT DIGNITY.
THEY AIN'T AFRAID
TO DIE.
WHAT SEEMS MOST IMPORTANT
TO ME IS THAT THEY AIN'T
AFRAID TO LIVE.
TODAY'S IMPORTANT TO THEM,
NOT THE DOLLAR TOMORROW
MIGHT BRING.
I SUPPOSE THE YANKEE
SAYS THAT'S LAZY.
ME ?  I SAY IT'S
A WAY OF LIVING.
AND THE WOMEN FOLK--
WHEW !  WELL, DAVY.
I FIGURED
YOU FAVORED MEXICAN LADIES.
THEY TELL ME YOU MARRIED ONE.
YEAH, I, UH, I DID.
I, UH--
WELL, DAVY,
I JUST AIN'T GOT,
YOU KNOW, YOUR WAY OF
PUTTING THINGS INTO WORDS,
BUT I GOT A FINE FAMILY.
I GUESS I'M WHAT YOU'D CALL
A LUCKY MAN.
NOW THAT AIN'T A BAD STAB
AT PUTTING IT INTO WORDS.
I SENT THEM UP TO COHUILA
WITH ALL THE TROUBLE
AROUND HERE.
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET THEM MIXED UP--
MAY I SPEAK PRIVATELY
WITH YOU, SIR ?
WELL, SURE, BUT--
YOU'RE THE SENORA DE LOPEZ,
AREN'T YOU ?
SENOR BOWIE.
I'M SORRY, I DID NOT
RECOGNIZE YOU AT FIRST.
THIS PLACE AIN'T FIT--
I KNOW, BUT THE MATTER
IS URGENT.
COULD I HAVE
A FEW PRIVATE WORDS
WITH THIS GENTLEMAN ?
SURE.  EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE INSIDE,
CROCKETT.
CROCKETT ?
YOU ARE THE FAMOUS
DAVY CROCKETT ?
WELL, I'M CROCKETT,
AND THEY NAMED ME DAVY
AFTER AN UNCLE THAT DIDN'T
LEAVE PA THE FARM AFTER ALL.
WELL, MR. CROCKETT,
SHORTLY AFTER YOU
LEFT MY ROOM,
I HEARD THE NOISE
OF AN ALTERCATION
IN THE STREET.
I COULD HEAR THE SOUND,
THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE
FROM MY WINDOW.
IT SOUNDED LIKE--
LIKE A DRUNKEN BRAWL.
I WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE.
I DIDN'T HEAR A THING.
ANYWAY, I SAW LIGHTS
IN THE OLD CHURCH
AND PEOPLE MOVING ABOUT...
AND ONE OF THEM WAS EMIL,
AND A THOUGHT CAME TO ME.
AS YOU MAY KNOW,
COLONEL TRAVIS
HAS ORDERED...
ALL POWDER AND BALL
FROM THE MERCHANTS
OF BEXAR.
AND HE DIDN'T FIND ANY
AT EMIL'S WAREHOUSE.
IT'S MY OPINION IT'S ALL
HIDDEN IN THE BASEMENT
OF THAT CHURCH.
AND, MR. CROCKETT,
THE DEFENDERS OF TEXAS...
ARE GOING TO NEED
THAT POWDER AGAINST
SANTA ANNA.
AND YOU'RE AGAINST
SANTA ANNA ?
BITTERLY, OF COURSE.
AND THIS EMIL,
HE'S FOR HIM ?
YES, HE IS.
THEN HOW DID HE FIGURE
YOU'D MARRY HIM ?
POLITICAL ARGUMENTS
DON'T FLAVOR FOLKS' SUPPER.
NEVERTHELESS, I AM GOING
TO MARRY HIM.  LET'S NOT
DISCUSS IT, MR. CROCKETT.
THE NAME IS DAVY,
AND I COULDN'T SLEEP NIGHTS
THINKING OF YOU--
WILL YOU SAY GOOD-BYE
FOR ME TO MR. BOWIE ?
WELL, I--
I CAN MAKE MY OWN WAY,
AND I HOPE THE INFORMATION
IS HELPFUL.
SOMETHING INTERESTING, JIM.
PARSON, ROUND UP A COUPLE
OF THE MEN--
FAIRLY SOBER--
AND MEET US OUT
IN THE STREET.
WHERE ARE WE GOING ?
TO CHURCH.
YEAH, DAVY.
PARSON, WHY'D YOU
RUN OFF WITHOUT ME ?
I TOLD YOU TO STAY BEHIND.
HE'S DRUNK.
STICK TO THE POINT.
WHY'D YOU RUN OFF
WITHOUT ME ?
JIM, THIS IS BEEKEEPER.
JIM BOWIE.
HI.
YOU CAN COME ALONG,
BUT HOLD YOUR BREATH.
CAN THEY SMELL,
THEY'LL BE WARNED
YOU'RE COMING.
EXCUSE ME.
YEAH.
EXCUSE ME.
WELL.
HERE, PARSON.
YES, SIR.
RIFLES.
MUST BE 50 OF 'EM.
?
THAT'S GUNPOWDER.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT STUFF.
WATCH IT !
STAND BACK
AND STAND STILL.
EXCUSE ME.
THERE MUST BE
A TON OF IT.
I'M SURE GONNA BE
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
THAT SOLDIER BOY'S FACE...
WHEN WE BRING
THIS IN.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING,
DAVY CROCKETT.
IT IS THAT,
MARIA DE LOPEZ Y VEJAR.
MY GOODNESS,
YOU REMEMBERED ALL THAT ?
SURE.  I'M NOT
AS STUPID AS I LOOK
FROM THE OUTSIDE.
WHAT'S SPANISH
FOR BREAKFAST ?
WELL, LET'S TAKE
A OUT
AND GET SOME
?
THAT MEANS WALK.
THAT MEANS "HAVE WALKED."
BUT NEVER MIND,
I'LL GET DRESSED.
WAIT A MINUTE.
FIRST WRITE ME A LETTER.
A LETTER ?
IN SPANISH.
OF COURSE.
TO WHOM IS
THE LETTER ADDRESSED ?
TO THE HONORABLE
DAVY CROCKETT, ESQUIRE.
YOU WISH A LETTER
WRITTEN TO YOURSELF ?
YEP.  TO THE HONORABLE
DAVY CROCKETT, ESQUIRE,
FORMER CONGRESSMAN
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
ESTEEMED SIR--
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
HURRY IT UP THERE.
SEEN DAVY?
NOBODY SEEN DAVY.
HE AIN'T ABOUT.
FIRST LIE YOU'VE TOLD TODAY,
THIMBLERIG.
GOOD MORNING, DAVY.
HOWDY.
SAY, DAVY,
WHAT KIND OF A LOAD
YOU GOT THERE ?
PRESENTS FOR
SOME FRIENDS.
LET'S GO,
PARSON !
YAH !  YAH !
GIDDAP !
HALT !
WHO GOES THERE ?
-
IS THAT YOU, BOB ?
- WHY, SURE.  CAN'T YOU SEE ?
THEN WHAT KIND OF
IDIOT NONSENSE IS THIS
"WHO GOES THERE" ?
WELL, TRAVIS--
COLONEL TRAVIS, THAT IS--
HE SAYS THAT I SHOULD--
SENTRY, OPEN THE GATE
FOR COLONEL BOWIE.
NEAR A TON OF GUNPOWDER HERE,
MEN.  GET IT UNLOADED.
THAT LONG ONE THERE,
HE'S DAVY CROCKETT,
AND THREE OF HIS GOOD MEN.
- COLONEL CROCKETT.
- HELLO, TRAVIS.
LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER
TO A PRAYER.
COLONEL, I'D BE PLEASED
IF YOU'D JOIN ME IN MY QUARTERS
FOR SOME REFRESHMENT.
PROUD TO.
OH, AND YOU TOO,
COLONEL BOWIE, IF YOU WILL.
I'M A STRANGER
AROUND THESE HERE PARTS.
WHAT DO YOU TEXICANS USE
FOR DRINKING WHISKEY ?
DRINKING WHISKEY ?
YOU GOT MANNERS,
OR AIN'T YA ?
CAPTAIN DICKINSON,
THIS IS COLONEL DAVY CROCKETT.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
GOOD MORNING.
OH, AND THIS IS MY COUSIN,
MRS. DICKINSON.
COLONEL CROCKETT.
COLONEL BOWIE.
HELLO, SUE.
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU,
DAVY CROCKETT.
I FEEL AS IF I KNOW YOU ALREADY.
YOU SEE, PART OF MY FAMILY
COME FROM TENNESSEE,
AND YOUR NAME IS
A HOUSEHOLD WORD THERE,
AT LEAST IN OUR HOUSE IT WAS.
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
IT'S NICE TO BE WELL THOUGHT OF.
MOMMY.
OH, YES, DARLING.
OH, I'VE ASKED YOU NOT
TO CLIMB THOSE STAIRS ALONE.
WHO'S THIS ?
CAN YOU SAY HELLO
TO COLONEL CROCKETT ?
HELLO.
EVERY SIZE THEY GET TO
SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LOVEABLE.
WILL YOU GENTLEMEN EXCUSE ME ?
GOOD-BYE, COLONEL.
GOOD-BYE.
KIND OF A SHAME KIDS
HAVE TO GROW UP INTO PEOPLE.
IT'S GOOD WE'RE ALL HERE,
GENTLEMEN.  CIGAR ?
PLEASE,
MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.
I HAVE SOME NEWS.
FANNIN IS DOING WELL
AT GOLIAD.
HE HAS MUSTERED
ALMOST A THOUSAND MEN...
AND SHOULD BE READY
TO MOVE SOUTH BY
THE FIRST OF THE WEEK.
A THOUSAND ?
IT DON'T SEEM POSSIBLE.
IT DOES SOUND TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE, I MUST CONFESS.
BUT WE CAN ONLY ADMIT
OUR DOUBTS TO EACH OTHER...
IN THE PRIVACY OF A ROOM,
AND NOT IN FRONT OF THE MEN.
AS FAR AS THE VOLUNTEERS
ARE CONCERNED,
WE'LL BE SURE THAT FANNIN
HAS A THOUSAND MEN OR MORE.
I GOT A REPUTATION
FOR TRUTH, TRAVIS.
I AIN'T.
EVERYBODY SAYS I'M A BORN LIAR.
BUT WHETHER WE TALK OUT LOUD
OR QUIET DON'T SEEM TO ME
THE POINT RIGHT NOW.
THE POINT IS,
HOW MANY MEN HAS FANNIN
AND WILL HE GET HERE IN TIME ?
WHETHER HE DOES OR DOESN'T
WE'LL BE TRAPPED HERE,
AND FOR NO REASON.
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS
BURN ALL OF BEXAR, INCLUDING
THIS MISSION, AND FIGHT--
AND FIGHT
A HARASSING ACTION ?
ANNOY SANTA ANNA
WHILE HE SWEEPS NORTH
ACROSS THE WHOLE OF TEXAS ?
THAT'S COLONEL BOWIE'S THEORY.
I CANNOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA.
WE COULD HIT AND RUN--
YOU SEEM TO FORGET
ONE THING, COLONEL BOWIE.
WHAT ?
THAT I COMMAND,
AND I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED
AGAINST YOUR PLAN.
NOW, LET US ATTACK
A MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEM.
COLONEL CROCKETT'S TENNESSEANS--
WILL THEY FIGHT, COLONEL ?
UP TO THE LAST TIME I SAW THEM,
THEY HADN'T SHOWN ANY STRONG
FEELINGS AGAINST FIGHTING.
BUT CAN YOU PERSUADE YOUR MEN
TO COME INTO THIS MISSION ?
I CAN ASK THEM.
AND YOU'RE
A VERY PERSUASIVE MAN,
ACCORDING TO YOUR REPUTATION.
BUILD UP THE STORY THAT
FANNIN HAS 1,000--
NO, 2,000 MEN.
PLAY DOWN THE SIZE
OF SANTA ANNA'S ARMY AND--
HOLD IT, TRAVIS.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
HE WANTS ME TO LIE TO MY MEN,
KEEP 'EM HERE WITH LIES.
LET THE TRUTH OF
SANTA ANNA'S STRENGTH BE KNOWN
DOWN THERE IN THE YARDS,
AND BY DAYBREAK THERE WON'T BE
A BAKER'S DOZEN LEFT.
YOU CALLING MY BOYS COWARDS ?
LET US DISPENSE WITH
FIRE-EATERS' PYROTECHNICS !
JUST REMEMBER THIS, TRAVIS.
MY MEN ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.
THEY'RE HERE BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO BE.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO KEEP 'EM FROM PACKING UP
AND GETTING OUTTA HERE.
AND LIKE ALL VOLUNTEERS
UNDISCIPLINED.
GOOD DAY, COLONEL BOWIE.
LAST NIGHT GAVE YOU
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
OF THE DISCIPLINE OF MY MEN.
OUR POSITION HERE
IS DESPERATE.
AND I FEEL SURE THAT
WHERE CROCKETT LEADS,
HIS MEN WILL FOLLOW.
YEAH.
THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY
THAT'S BEEN KINDA WORRYING ME.
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
I'M GONNA PASS
THE WORD AROUND...
WHAT YOU TEXANS USE
FOR DRINKING WHISKEY
IS DRINKING WHISKEY.
AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT,
YOU GOT REAL GOOD MANNERS,
SEEING HOW YOU SUFFER
THE HANDICAP OF HAVING
NEVER BEEN IN TENNESSEE.
HEY, DAVY, IS IT TRUE
YOU FOUGHT A FOUR-DAY FIGHT
WITH MIKE FINK ?
WHY, THAT'S A BLASTED LIE,
ONE OF THEM STORIES
LOOSE-MOUTHED PEOPLE
TELL AROUND.
MIKE AND ME QUIT AT SUNDOWN.
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE FOURTH DAY UNTIL, UH,
THE NEXT MORNING.
SEE YA, MEN.
LET HER RIP, PARSON !
SENORA LOPEZ.
DON JUAN,
THIS IS MR. DAVY CROCKETT.
I'M HONORED.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
SENOR SEGUIN IS THE ALCALDE--
I MEAN, THE MAYOR
OF SAN ANTONIO DE BEXAR.
WELL, HE'S GOT
A PRETTY BUSY TOWN.
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING LIKE SHEEP
THAT HAVE SMELLED A WOLF PACK.
I NEVER SAID NO SUCH A-THING.
WHEN US TOOK
THAT POWDER IN THERE,
THAT FELLA TRAVIS
ASKED IF US TENNESSEANS
WAS GONNA JOIN UP WITH HIM.
THAT'S ALL.
HE NEVER ASKED US
TO FIGHT HIS FIGHT FOR HIM.
HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.
BREAKFAST.  TORTILLAS ?
NEVER GET BURNT
DRINKING THIS STUFF.
WELL, I ONLY KNOW PART
OF THIS HERE TEXAS,
AND NONE OF THESE TEXICANS
IS RELATED TO ME,
SO WHY SHOULD I FIGHT FOR THEM ?
RIGHT.  AIN'T OUR OX
THAT'S GETTIN' GORED.
TALKING ABOUT WHOSE OX
GETS GORED, FIGURE THIS:
FELLA GETS IN THE HABIT
OF GORIN' OXES,
WHETS HIS APPETITE.
HE MAY COME UP NORTH NEXT
AND GORE YOURS.
MEN, WE'RE IN A LITTLE FIX,
SORT OF.
THE HE-BULL AROUND HERE,
GENERAL SANTA ANNA,
HE'S MAD AT US.
YEAH ?
HE WROTE US A LETTER.
I CAN'T READ IT,
IT'S IN SPANISH,
BUT THE YOUNG LADY WILL.
IT IS ADDRESSED TO DAVY CROCKETT
AND THE TENNESSEANS
WHO ACCOMPANY HIM.
"BE IT KNOWN:
YOU ARE INTERLOPERS...
"DEPART WITH ALL HASTE
AND AT ONCE,
"BECAUSE IT HAS COME
TO OUR ATTENTION...
"YOU ARE POSSIBLY CONSIDERING
JOINING THE REBELS
NOW SKULKING IN THE MISSION.
"SHOULD YOU FAIL
TO ABIDE BY THIS ORDER,
"I SHALL CHASTISE YOU
EVEN UNTO DEATH.
SIGNED, GENERALISSIMO
ANTONIO MIGUEL DE SANTA ANNA."
FELLA KINDA FANCIES HIMSELF,
DON'T HE ?
SURE DOES HAVE
A BIG-SOUNDING NAME.
GIVING US ORDERS !
WHO DO HE THINK HE AM,
ANDY-BY-GOD-JACKSON ?
RILES ME WHEN SOMEBODY
TELLS ME TO GO HERE,
OR I CAN'T GO THERE.
I AIN'T NEVER BEEN RUN OUT
OF NO PLACE,
EXCEPT THE TIME MY OLD PA
KICKED ME OVER EVERY ACRE
OF THAT SECTION IN OHIO.
BUT I WAS JUST
A SHIRTTAIL KID THEN.
MY PA HAD BIG FEET.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAVY ?
WE GONNA LET THIS MAN TELL US
WHAT WE CAN OR CAN'T DO ?
DAVY, MAYBE WE BETTER SADDLE UP
AND PAY THIS FELLA A VISIT.
DO "CHASTISE" MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT DO ?
IT DO.
DAVY, LET'S DO SADDLE UP
AND GO LEARN
THAT GENTLEMAN HIS MANNERS.
WE WON'T HAVE TO.
HE'S WEARING OUT HORSES
COMING TOWARD US.
I GUESS WE CAN'T
STOP HIM FROM COMING,
BUT I RECKON WE CAN ARRANGE
FOR HIM TO LIMP GOING BACK.
ONE THING I OUGHTA TELL YOU:
SANTA ANNA
NEVER WROTE THAT LETTER.
I WAS FIGURING
HOW TO TELL YOU FELLAS
ABOUT THIS TEXICAN HOEDOWN,
IF HE'D HAVE HAD THE CHANCE
TO SAY IT.
DAVY, I AIN'T NEVER SAID
I AIN'T BEEN WHUPPED.
I HAVE.
BUT I GIVE EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF THEM FELLAS A CHANCE
TO DIG IN AND GET THE JOB DONE.
BUT I AIN'T NEVER TOOK
NOBODY'S WORD IN ADVANCE THAT
THEY WAS GONNA CHAS--
CHASTISE.
CHASTISE.  MUCH OBLIGED.
SPEAK UP, DAVY.
WE'RE GONNA STAY, AIN'T WE ?
WELL, I'M THINKING IT OVER.
WHAT'S THERE
TO THINK ABOUT ?
YOU GETTIN' THAT OLD ?
THE MAN TOED THE MARK
AND DARED US.
CHASTISE, HE SAID.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHASTISE.
BUT I WROTE THE LETTER.
NOW DON'T YOU START WEASELING.
YOU SAID YOURSELF...
THEM'D BE THE VERY WORDS
HE'D WRITE TO US IF'N
HE WAS TO WRITE US A LETTER.
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME.
WE'LL FIGHT.
-
-
BUT FIRST, THE YOUNG LADY AND I
WILL TAKE A
GATHER UP YOUR POSSIBLES
AND I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU LATER.
RIGHT, DAVY !
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
YOUR SPANISH IS IMPROVING.
IT KINDA CHEERS ME TO SEE
THE COLONEL WITH THAT LADY.
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
HE HAD ME WORRIED.
LATELY, HE AIN'T BEEN LOOKING AT
THE GIRLS LIKE HE WAS STARVED.
BEING IN CONGRESS
HAS RUINED MANY A GOOD MAN.
ALL I HEAR IS CROCKETT,
THE BEAR KILLER;
CROCKETT,
THE INDIAN FIGHTER;
CROCKETT, THE BRAWLER.
CROCKETT HAS BRAINS.
KEPT IT HIDDEN
A NUMBER OF YEARS.
YOU LIKE MY TENNESSEANS,
FLACA ?
OH, YES.
COULD STRAIN 10,000 AND NEVER
COME UP WITH 23 BETTER.
EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEN
HAS BEEN AT MY ELBOW,
SAVE THE BOY SMITTY,
WHEN SOME DIFFICULTY AROSE.
SOME OF THEM DON'T BATHE
AS OFTEN AS POLITE FOLKS
WOULD THINK NECESSARY,
BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM
SMELLS SWEET TO ME.
AND I WAS THE ONE
THAT SAID THIS COUNTRY
WAS BURNT-OVER SAND.
IT'S GREEN AND GROWING,
LIKE THOSE GREEN PASTURES
THEY TALK ABOUT.
LORD ABOVE,
THAT'S ONE BEAUTIFUL TREE.
THIS TREE MUST'VE
BEEN GROWED BEFORE...
MAN PUT HIS FIRST DIRTY
FOOTPRINTS ON THIS PRAIRIE.
KIND OF A TREE ADAM AND EVE
MUST'VE MET UNDER.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, FLACA ?
I GUESS I SAW
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TREES...
BEFORE I EVER TOOK
A LONG THOUGHTFUL LOOK AT ONE.
MOSTLY I LOOKED AT A TREE
TO SEE WAS THERE A BEAR IN IT
OR AN INDIAN BEHIND IT.
DAVY, WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO US ?
I MEAN, TO YOU AND ME ?
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,
FLACA, AND I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TIGHT.
IT MAY SOUND LIKE I'M TALKING
ABOUT ME, BUT I'M NOT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M TALKING ABOUT
ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU ADDED UP MY LIFE,
AND I'D SPENT IT ALL...
EITHER STOMPING OTHER MEN OR,
IN SOME CASES, GETTIN' STOMPED.
HAD ME SOME MONEY
AND HAD ME SOME MEDALS,
BUT NONE OF IT SEEMED
A LIFETIME WORTH THE PAIN
OF THE MOTHER THAT BORE ME.
IT WAS LIKE I WAS EMPTY.
WELL, I'M NOT EMPTY ANYMORE.
TO HIT A LICK AGAINST
WHAT'S WRONG OR TO SAY
A WORD FOR WHAT'S RIGHT,
EVEN THOUGH YOU GET WALLOPED
FOR SAYING THAT WORD.
NOW, I MAY SOUND
LIKE A BIBLE BEATER...
YELLING UP A REVIVAL AT
A RIVER-CROSSING CAMP MEETING,
BUT THAT DON'T CHANGE
THE TRUTH NONE.
THERE'S RIGHT AND THERE'S WRONG.
YOU GOT TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER.
YOU DO THE ONE
AND YOU'RE LIVING.
YOU DO THE OTHER
AND YOU MAY BE WALKING AROUND,
BUT YOU'RE DEAD
AS A BEAVER HAT.
MY THINGS.
ALL MY LUGGAGE
IS IN THE BUGGY.
HAD MY MEN TAKE CARE OF IT.
YOUR GEWGAWS
MAY BE ROUGH-PACKED,
BUT THEY'RE ALL THERE.
YOU ARE SENDING ME AWAY.
YOU--
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FIGHT
AGAINST EVIL, BUT YOU--
YOU ARE SENDING ME
TO SAFETY.
FLACA, YOU HAVE
AN IMPORTANT NAME.
YOU KNOW A MILLION WORDS
AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE USED.
I'M SENDING YOU
TO FIGHT YOUR WAR,
TO TALK UP A HOWLING MOB.
I'LL STAY HERE
AND HIT A LICK.
I HOPE YOU CAN DRIVE A MULE.
HIS NAME'S JESUS,
THEY TOLD ME.
HE SEEMS A GOOD, HONEST MULE.
MAYBE I'LL NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.
IF THAT'S WHAT'S WRITTEN,
THAT'S WHAT'S WRITTEN.
WHEN IT'S TIME, IT'S TIME.
TALKING ONLY MAKES IT
THE HARDER, FLACA,
SO STIR UP THAT MULE.
DAVY, I--
YOU NEVER PRAY,
DO YOU, DAVY ?
I NEVER FOUND THE TIME.
SIR, TENNESSEANS.
COLONEL TRAVIS.
CROCKETT AND HIS MEN.
GO DOWN AND OPEN THE GATE.
I'LL JUST HOLLER DOWN.
YOUR ORDERS WERE TO GO DOWN,
NOT HOLLER DOWN, MR. DENNISON.
YES, SIR.
CRACK SHOTS,
THOSE TENNESSEANS.
TWENTY TIMES THEIR NUMBER
IS WHAT WE NEED, AND MORE.
OH, I'M SORRY, WILL.
SUCH GLOOMY REMARKS
ARE FOR YOUR EARS ALONE.
ISN'T THAT BOWIE GALLOPING
UP THERE TO CATCH THEM ?
I CAN JUST HEAR HIM
PLEADING HIS CAUSE.
CROCKETT SEEMS TO ME
THE TYPE OF MAN
THAT WOULD CHOOSE BOWIE.
WHAT YOU MEAN IS CROCKETT ISN'T
THE TYPE OF MAN TO CHOOSE ME.
OH, WILL,
DEPEND ON YOU TO SAY IT
THE MOST BRUTAL WAY.
MOST FACTS ARE BRUTAL.
JUST LOOK AT
THAT GREAT KNIFE-FIGHTER
YAPPING AT CROCKETT.
CUT, SLASH AND RUN.
LET'S GET MOUNTED.
CUT, SLASH AND RUN.
CUT, SLASH AND RUN.
COST SANTA ANNA
50 OR 100 TROOPS...
AT EVERY CREEK CROSSING
BETWEEN HERE AND THE NORTH.
SOUNDS REASONABLE
THE WAY YOU PUT IT, JIM,
BUT TRAVIS,
HE'S GOT A POINT TOO.
TAKES THINKING ON.
HALT.  WHO GOES THERE ?
BOB, I SWEAR I'M GONNA
SHOOT YOU OFF THAT WALL.
ARE YOU BLIND ?
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD
TO HOLLER EVERY TIME.
WELL, DON'T HOLLER AT ME !
IDIOT.
YOU THINK ON IT, DAVY,
YOU'LL SIDE WITH ME.
WHAT IS IT ?
TENNESSEANS, NELL.
ALL THE WAY FROM HOME.
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THEM,
JOCKO ?  COULD BE MY BROTHER
MALACHI'S WITH 'EM.
OH, HE WAS A CONSIDERABLE FELLA
TO GO WHERE THERE WAS TROUBLE.
HE WAS THAT.  BUT NELL,
YOU KNOW MALACHI WAS HUNGED,
OR SO SOME FOLKS TOLD US.
COLONEL CROCKETT, I'M GLAD
YOU WERE ABLE TO PERSUADE
YOUR MEN TO JOIN US.
WELL, THEY INSISTED, SORT OF.
OUR HEARTIEST WELCOME.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE ARE PROUD TO WELCOME
THESE PATRIOTIC MEN...
SERGEANT LIGHTFOOT.
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR MEN
RAISE A CHEER
FOR OUR GALLANT ALLIES...
FROM THE ILLUSTRIOUS STATE
OF TENNESSEE.
HOORAY !
HOORAY !
HOORAY !
CAPTAIN, YOU WILL ATTEND
TO THE BILLETING OF THESE MEN.
AFTER YOU ARE QUARTERED,
GENTLEMEN,
I WILL TAKE YOU ON A TOUR
OF THE EMPLACEMENTS.
CROCKETT !
DAVY CROCKETT !
WE'RE FROM TENNESSEE.
HOWDY, FOLKS.
WE SEEN YOU WHEN YOU CAME
TO STINK WELLS...
TO SPEAK ABOUT
THAT JOB FOR CONGRESS.
YOU SHOOK HANDS WITH ME.
I'LL DO HER AGAIN.
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU, THOUGH.
OTHER FELLA GAVE HIM FOUR BITS.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE.
GLAD THERE WERE ENOUGH
SENSIBLE FOLKS LIKE YOU
TO VOTE ME OUT OF THAT JOB.
WELL, LATER ON WE'LL HAVE
A REAL OLD HOME TALK FEST.
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET
QUARTERED AND BEDDED DOWN.
WILL YOU EXCUSE US ?
YOU SHOULD'VE
VOTED FOR HIM, JOCKO.
OF OUR 24 PIECES OF ORDINANCE,
FIVE ARE THESE SIX-POUNDERS.
SOMETHING'S STIRRING IN TOWN.
LADIES WILL TAKE COVER, PLEASE.
CAPTAIN DICKINSON,
ARE YOUR MEN DISPOSED ?
AT THEIR POSTS, SIR.
NO ONE WILL FIRE
UNLESS I SO ORDER !
THOSE PEOPLE
ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF A FLAG OF TRUCE.
"FROM THE HEADQUARTERS
OF GENERALISSIMO
ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA,
"ABSOLUTE RULER OF MEXICO,
"BE IT KNOWN:
"THE PROVINCE OF MEXICO
KNOWN AS TEXAS...
"ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE MISSION
WILL LEAVE AT ONCE,
"LEAVING ALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION
BEHIND THEM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JIM ?
I'D HATE TO SAY
ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT
THAT LONG-WINDED JACKANAPES,
BUT HE DOES KNOW THE SHORT WAY
TO START A WAR.
SIXTH.
THE SIX VERACRUZANO FUSILIERS.
THEY'RE BIVOUACKING ABOUT A MILE
SOUTH OF OUR WEST BASTION.
LIGHT ARTILLERY, LANCERS,
SOME ENGINEERS.
NOT ONE UNIT
OF HEAVY ASSAULT TROOPS
HAS ARRIVED YET,
AND IT STILL ADDS UP
TO 2,000 MEN.
THAT'LL BE
TO OUR ADVANTAGE, DICK.
THAT MAIN BODY MUST BE
STRUNG OUT FOR MILES.
THE ASSAULT INFANTRY,
HEAVY ARTILLERY,
COMMISSARY AND SUPPLY TRAINS,
THEY WON'T BE HERE
FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS.
AND THE ACTUAL BATTLE
CAN'T START UNTIL THEN.
OH, THERE'LL BE AN OCCASIONAL
SORTIE OR ARTILLERY FIRE...
FEELING OUT OUR DEFENSES,
BUT THEY WON'T COMMIT THEMSELVES
TO AN ACTUAL ATTACK...
UNTIL SANTA ANNA'S HERE
WITH HIS MAIN FORCE.
THEN WHAT ?
THEN FANNIN WILL BE HERE.
MORE TROOPS ARRIVING
EVERY HOUR.
PRETTIEST ARMY
I EVER DID SEE.
YEAH.
IF I TAKE MY MEN OUT,
DO YOU GO WITH ME ?
DAVY, YOU KNOW THIS OLD MISSION
CAN'T STAND UP IN FRONT
OF SANTA ANNA'S ARMY.
MY WAY'S THE ONLY WAY.
TRAVIS SAYS THAT
FANNIN'S COMING.
TRAVIS SAYS.
I WOULDN'T TAKE
TRAVIS' WORD...
THAT NIGHT'S DARK
AND DAY'S LIGHT.
FLY'S IN THE BUTTERMILK.
SHOO, FLY, SHOO.
THAT'S ALL.
ANTS IN THE SUGAR BOWL,
TWO BY TWO.
THAT'S ALL.
I CARRIED TWICE AS MUCH.
YOU'RE TWICE AS BIG.
PATROL'S IN TROUBLE !
DOGGONE IT, BEEKEEPER !
I THOUGHT YOU WASN'T GONNA OPEN
THAT CORN LIQUOR TILL NIGHTFALL.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ?
IT'S ONLY A HALF HOUR
TILL DARK.
BESIDES, IT'S MY KEG,
AIN'T IT ?
OH, ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME SOME OF THAT STUFF.
I'M SO SCARED,
I COULD DRINK ALL OF IT.
MAYBE I WILL.
- WHAT'D YOU SEE, IRISH ?
- MORE THAN I WANTED TO, JIM.
A LOT OF MEN ARRIVING.
AND THEY GOT
THE DARN BLASTEDEST CANNON
EVER I DID SEE.
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
TWELVE OR FOURTEEN
FOOT LONG MAYBE.
HE SURE DRAWS PRETTY,
DON'T HE ?
FRIGHTENING.
TWELVE, FOURTEEN FEET LONG.
ARE YOU SURE, IRISH ?
WELL, YEAH.
YES, SIR.
FINN !
YOU WERE ORDERED TO MAKE
A REPORT TO ME, NOT TO HOLD
LECTURE COURSES.  GET UP HERE !
ALL RIGHT, WILL--
UH, COLONEL TRAVIS.
HEY, TRAVIS,
WITH A CANNON LIKE THAT,
THEM SANTA ANNA FELLAS
CAN JUST SIT OUT THERE AND
GIVE US WHAT FOR, CAN'T THEY ?
THERE'S NO SUCH CANNON
IN THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT,
THOUGH THEY HAVE SOME IN EUROPE,
ACCORDING TO LAST REPORTS.
ACTING LIEUTENANT FINN
IS EXAGGERATING.
SHE'S A BIG ONE, DAVY, AND
SHE'S SHOOTING FROM OVER HERE !
BATTERY ONE, IS YOUR GUN READY ?
WE'RE PRIMED AND READY, SIR.
GIVE IT FULL ELEVATION.
YES, SIR !
THE GUN IS READY, SIR.
FIRE !
KINDA SHORT THERE,
COLONEL MR. TRAVIS.
I SURE AM GLAD I SEEN
THAT THERE CANNON SITTING
OUT THERE ON THAT PRAIRIE.
FOR A MINUTE, I THOUGHT
THEY WAS SHOOTING AT US...
FROM ONE OF THEM OLD COUNTRIES
WAY OVER IN EUROPE.
NAW.  OH, NO,
THEY WOULDN'T DARE.
MAN, THAT AIN'T NO FAIR WAY
TO FIGHT A WAR !
WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, CROCKETT.
PLAIN AS CAN BE.
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER DARK ?
GOOD.
THIMBLERIG, 15 MEN,
RIGHT AFTER DARK, ALL SOBER.
BOO !
HALT !
I LOST THE BET.
HUH ?
I BET SOME OF MY FRIENDS
I COULD SNEAK UP ON YOU
WITHOUT YOU HEARING ME.
FRIEND, YOU LIKE TO GOT
A HOLE IN YOUR HEAD.
TIE HIM LOOSE.
KICK THAT FIRE OUT
AND KILL OUR SILHOUETTE.
LET'S GO.
OVER THE WALL, LET'S GO.
EVERYTHING SET ?
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME, MEN.
OPEN THE GATE.
SOMEBODY JUMPED HIM.
I'LL SAY THEY DID.
AND SOME OF THEM
STEPPED ON ME GOING BY...
AND NEVER SO MUCH AS
A "BY YOUR LEAVE"
FROM NARY A ONE OF THEM.
DAMN IT !
RETURN TO YOUR POSTS.
YES, SIR.
CLOSE THE GATE.
WELL, YOU BETTER GET
YOUR MEN MOUNTED THEN.
SEE IF YOU CAN
GIVE THEM ANY HELP.
YES, SIR.
DETAIL, STAND A-HORSE.
GET THE POWDER !
- WHERE'S THE MUD ?
-
CLEAR OUT !
I'LL COVER !
YOU HEARD HIM, MEN !
GO ON, KID,
GET OUTTA HERE !
I CAN SHOOT.
GOLLY, WHAT A GUN.
GO ON, GRAB A HORSE.
CORPORAL PARDEE,
NO ONE WILL FIRE UNTIL
YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOUR TARGET.
YES, SIR.
LET'S GIVE 'EM A HAND, BOYS.
KNOCK ON IT.
PICK 'EM UP, PICK 'EM UP !
EVERYBODY RIDES DOUBLE.
COME ON, PICK 'EM UP !
CLOSE THE GATE.
GOOD WORK, SMITTY.
WE NEVER MISSED YOU, JIM.
IT'S A GOOD THING THE KID DID.
THAT HORSE FOLDED WITH ME.
YOU ALL RIGHT, JIM ?
YEAH, SURE.
OH, MR. SMITH,
YOU'VE BEEN HURT.
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
DOCTOR !
I TELL YOU, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MM-HMM.
NO BONES BROKEN.
ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE
OF DR. BEEKEEPER'S FIX-ALL.
SEE ?  I--
PRETTY CLOSE.
BOWIE ?
OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.
TURNED A HORSE OVER.
JETHRO ?
YES, SIR.
TELL COLONEL BOWIE I WISH
TO SPEAK TO HIM AT ONCE.
YES, SIR.
OVER HERE,
WHERE WE CAN HAVE
A LITTLE PRIVACY.
YES, SIR.
POST THIS AREA.
YES, SIR.
WILL, CONSIDERING THE WAY
THINGS TURNED OUT, I--
DICK, LEAVE THIS TO ME.
COLONEL BOWIE.
I HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH INSUBORDINATION.
YOU HAVE ?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO IT.
WHEN AND WHERE ?
I HEAR YOU'RE A GOOD SHOT,
SO LET'S CHOOSE PISTOLS.
I HAD ASSUMED YOU WOULD HAVE
CHOSEN THE RUFFIAN'S KNIFE.
GENTLEMEN, I BEG--
DICK, ACT FOR ME.
TIME ?
I SUGGEST AFTER
THIS WAR IS OVER.
YES, THE MINUTE--
THE VERY MINUTE
THIS WAR IS OVER.
JIM ?
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
ONE LAST WORD, BOWIE.
THIS EVENING'S EPISODE.
BY GOING ON A MISSION
WITHOUT ORDERS,
YOU ENDANGERED THIS COMMAND.
IF NOT FOR THE FORTUNATE
INTERVENTION OF CAPTAIN
DICKINSON AND HIS PATROL,
A LARGE NUMBER OF
BADLY NEEDED VOLUNTEERS
WOULD BE DEAD OUT THERE...
INSTEAD OF
AT THEIR POSTS IN HERE.
I DEMAND YOUR WORD OF HONOR
THAT THERE WILL BE
NO REPETITION OF SUCH CONDUCT.
OTHERWISE, I SHALL BE FORCED
TO ORDER YOUR ARREST.
TRAVIS.
DON'T YOU WORRY ANYMORE
ABOUT ARREST OR INSUBORDINATION.
I TAKE MY PEOPLE OUT
AT DAYBREAK.
COLONEL TRAVIS,
I'M AN OLD MAN,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
THAT JETHRO.
REMINDS ME OF A STORY--
PLEASE, CROCKETT.
NO HOMESPUN WISDOM.
NO CRACKER-BARREL PHILOSOPHY.
NONE OF THE BACKWOODS WIT
FOR WHICH YOU ARE FAMOUS.
GOOD NIGHT.
YOU BETTER SLACK OFF
ON ME, MISTER.
THIS CODE-OF-HONOR BUSINESS
DOESN'T BOTHER ME A BIT.
MY ONLY CONCERN HERE
IS 23 TENNESSEANS,
SO YOU BETTER LET ME KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR MIND.
I'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT
WOULD'VE BEEN OBVIOUS TO YOU.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS.
THERE'S SANTA ANNA
WITH 7,000 MEN.
UP HERE, THE SABINE RIVER.
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE,
SAM HOUSTON IS TRYING
TO ORGANIZE AN ARMY.
AND RIGHT IN BETWEEN...
IS THE ALAMO.
SANTA ANNA
CAN'T GO AROUND...
AND LEAVE A FORT ALONG
HIS LINES OF COMMUNICATION.
HE MUST REDUCE THE ALAMO
BY STORM.
EVERY MINUTE OF TIME WE BUY
FOR SAM HOUSTON...
IS ANOTHER PRECIOUS MINUTE
IN THE LIFE OF TEXAS.
AND CROCKETT, NOBODY
IS EVER GOING TO SAY...
THAT WILLIAM BARRETT TRAVIS DID
NOT BUY EVERY MINUTE POSSIBLE.
MAKES SENSE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL BOWIE THAT ?
BECAUSE A COMMANDER
DOES NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN
HIS EVERY DECISION.
YOU EXPLAINED TO ME.
I'VE GREAT RESPECT
FOR YOU, CROCKETT,
BUT I HAVE NONE FOR
THAT KNIFE-FIGHTING ADVENTURER.
I FIGURED ANY FELLA
THAT SHOULDERED A GUN
WAS DESERVING OF RESPECT.
BUT THEN,
I'M NOT A REAL SOLDIER.
I NEVER FOUGHT ANYBODY
BUT INJUNS,
UNLESS YOU COUNT THE BRITISH.
CROCKETT.
I MUST ASK YOU
TO FORGIVE MY RUDENESS
EARLIER ONTO YOU.
I'M AN EASY FORGIVER...
AT TIMES.
GOOD NIGHT, TRAVIS.
CRACK OUT A COUPLE OF JUGS
AND BRING THAT GUITAR.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, DAVY ?
SERENADE.
WELL,
I HOPE YOU TOLD
THAT LONG-WINDED IDIOT
WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM.
I'M NOT RIGHTLY SURE
WHAT I THINK OF HIM.
WHAT'S ALL THIS ?
I FIGURED WE'D CRACK A JUG AND
TELL EACH OTHER OUR TROUBLES.
WAIT A MINUTE, CROCKETT.
DON'T TRY YOUR
WINNING WAYS ON ME.
MY MIND'S MADE UP.
WE CAN HAVE
A FAREWELL DRINK.
YOU MEAN YOU'RE STAYING ?
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURE, JIM.
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HAVE
A DRINK OR TWO OR TEN,
BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA GET ME DRUNK
AND CHANGE MY MIND.
OF COURSE NOT.
MORNING PATROL, LET'S GO !
RISE AND SHINE !
UP AND AT 'EM !
BEEKEEPER, COME ON.
SHOW A LEG.
STOP.
GET OUTTA THERE.
THIMBLERIG, COME ON.
IT'S YOUR DUTY.
YOUR DUTY.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WAKE US ALL.
I'LL GET 'EM UP,
SERGEANT.
THANKS, PARSON.  THANKS.
HEY !
TWO DOLLARS, AMERICAN,
IF YOU TAKE OUT MY PATROL.
TWO DOLLARS ?
THIS MORNING, I WOULDN'T TAKE
YOUR PATROL FOR TEN.
I WOULD.
GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL, SCOTTY.
WELL, DAVY, IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU DONE IT AGAIN.
IT DO.
BOWIE ?
IT LOOKED LIKE
A TIE TO ME.
YOUR DUTY.
MORNING, COLONEL.
HE'S STILL SLEEPING.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT,
JETHRO.
OW !
CROCKETT !
CROCKETT, WHAT THE DEVIL--
GOOD MORNING, SMITTY, DOC.
WELL, YOU GOT YOURSELF
FAMOUS LAST NIGHT.
NOW EVERY PLACE
THEY TALK ABOUT JIM BOWIE,
THEY'LL HAVE TO TELL ABOUT
THE MAN THAT PULLED HIM OUT
FROM UNDER THE TROOPS.
GEE, WILL THEY ?
JIM, THE KID'S
ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT SANDBAR EPISODE.
OH, COME ON, CROCKETT.
WELL, THAT'S THE TRUTH.
HE'S NEVER HEARD ANYTHING
BUT HEARSAY.
GOSH, YES, MR. BOWIE.
ALL THE FELLAS BACK HOME
TALK ABOUT THAT.
SAY GOOD-BYE TO JIM.
YOU GOING SOMEPLACE,
COLONEL--  JIM ?
NO.
NO, I'M NOT GOING NO PLACE.
THAT'S JUST CROCKETT'S IDEA
OF A JOKE.
NOW, YOU GET WELL, SMITTY BOY.
AND THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
IT WAS RUMORED
WE WERE LEAVING THIS MORNING.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN WE'RE LEAVING.
GET THAT GEAR PUT AWAY.
CROCKETT.
BY GOD, BOY,
YOU'RE BAD-TEMPERED.
NOW DON'T YOU EVER TRY
TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME AGAIN.
ONCE WAS ENOUGH.
I MAKE UP MY OWN MIND.
NEVER THOUGHT OTHERWISE,
JIM.
I WAS WONDERING, DO YOU THINK
THERE'D BE A MOUTHFUL
OF THAT CORN JUICE LEFT ?
WE COULD KINDA CUT THE TAR
OUT OF OUR THROATS.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, DAVY.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I STILL SAY
YOU'RE BAD-TEMPERED.
HALT !  WHO GOES THERE ?
DON'T SHOOT, AMIGO !
A MESSAGE FOR JIM BOWIE...
IN THE SOMBRERO.
JIM ?
FELLA SAYS THERE'S A MESSAGE
IN THIS HAT FOR YOU.
KIND OF A STRANGE WAY
TO BE SENDING MESSAGES,
AIN'T IT ?
YEAH.
MAYBE SANTA ANNA'S SURRENDERED.
WHAT IS IT, JIM ?
I NEVER KNEW THE NIGHT
COULD BE SO DARK.
MY WIFE,
SHE--
SHE'S DEAD.
I LIVED THROUGH IT, JIM.
IT'S HARD.
IT WAS THE PLAGUE.
THE DAMN PLAGUE.
OH, GOD, DEAR GOD.
OH, DAVY, SHE--
SHE WAS SO SMALL.
SO TINY,
SO VERY TINY.
SHE WANTED TO STAY IN BEXAR
TO BE NEAR ME,
BUT I MADE HER GO
TO COHUILA.
I MADE HER GO.
MY MAN, PARSON,
HE'S KIND OF A PREACHER.
HE KEEPS SAYING,
"LITTLE DO WE MORTALS KNOW."
HOLD YOUR HEAD UP, JIM.
COLONEL BOWIE !
YOU'VE HAD A COMMUNICATION
FROM OUTSIDE THESE WALLS.
THIS IS AGAINST MY ORDERS.
WHAT INFORMATION
HAVE YOU RECEIVED ?
BOWIE, HAND ME THAT LETTER.
YOU MAY DIE TONIGHT.
THAT LITTLE LADY, JIM,
SHE WON'T LIKE IT.
COLONEL BOWIE,
PLEASE ACCEPT
MY MOST PROFOUND SYMPATHY...
AND MY REGRET FOR HAVING
DISTURBED YOU AT SUCH A MOMENT.
THIS IN NO WAY IMPAIRS
YOUR RIGHT TO CALL ME
ON THE FIELD OF HONOR...
AT A LATER DATE.
BUT I WISH TO EXPRESS
MY SORROW FOR YOU...
AND PRESENT MY APOLOGY FOR BEING
SUCH A BOOR AT SUCH A TIME.
TRAVIS,
YOU CAN'T HELP BEING YOU,
AND I CAN'T HELP BEING ME.
¶¶
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT ?
32 CASES HOSPITALIZED
THIS MORNING.
WELL, TELL 'EM TO MOVE OVER.
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S PARTYING--
OH, NO, SIR.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
ANOTHER OFFICERS' CALL.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
IT'S ALL LIKE THAT.
SIR.
GENTLEMEN.
DOCTOR.
IT'S AS SIMPLE
AS THIS, GENTLEMEN.
I HAD 32 CASES OF
MILD DYSENTERY THIS MORNING.
I TESTED THE SALT PORK BARREL
THE RATIONS WERE ISSUED FROM--
IT'S TAINTED.
SO IS EVERY OTHER BARREL
IN THE WAREHOUSE.
SERGEANT ?
BARRING THE PORK,
I FIGURE WE HAVE...
THREE OR FOUR DAYS FULL RATIONS
TO SERVE TO THE GARRISON.
YOU SEE THE DILEMMA,
GENTLEMEN.
WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF FOOD.
HOWEVER, SANTA ANNA DOES NOT
SUFFER UNDER THE SAME HANDICAP.
THEREFORE,
OUR COURSE IS OBVIOUS.
IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME.
¶¶
I CAN THINK OF
MORE COMFORTABLE PLACES
TO WATCH THAT SHOW FROM.
QUIET.
DICK.
IT'S A HALF HOUR TO DAYBREAK.
HAVE YOUR MEN STAND TO HORSE.
YES, SIR.
THE NIGHT HERDERS.
TWO TO EACH ONE OF 'EM.
DON'T MISS.  THERE'LL BE
A LOT OF HUNGRY KIDS.
OKAY, GO.
SMITTY.
GRAB A HORSE OFF THAT
PICKET LINE FOR SMITTY.
GET A GOOD ONE.
COLONEL DAVY,
CAN I ASK YOU FELLAS SOMETHING,
FACE TO FACE ?
SURE THING, KID.
ARE YOU REALLY SENDING ME
BECAUSE I'M SUCH A GOOD HORSEMAN
LIKE YOU SAID ?
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE.
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN
THE BEEKEEPER, AND YOU CAN SWIM
BETTER THAN THE GAMBLER.
IT AIN'T BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK
I'D BE WORTH MY SALT
WHEN THE FIGHTING STARTS ?
SMITTY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
OF ALL THE MEN IN THIS OUTFIT,
I'D PICK YOU TO SIDE ME
IF THE GOING WAS ROUGH.
YOU SEE ?
GEE.
GET ON THIS HORSE.
NOW THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE,
KID, BUT DARK.
GOOD LUCK, SMITTY.
IT'LL TAKE HIM QUITE A FEW DAYS
TO GET TO HOUSTON.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
THE SOUTH SIDE'S
ALL TAKEN CARE OF.
GET A HORSE.
NOW ALL WE CAN DO
IS WAIT.
THAT'S THE HARDEST PART.
SURE IS.
CARRY ON, DICK,
AND GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU, WILL.
BEST OF LUCK, DICKINSON.
FORWARD YO !
IF THEY DON'T SHOOT
PRETTY QUICK,
WE'VE GOT TO GO ANYWAY.
LET'S TAKE 'EM !
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
PICK YOUR TARGETS.
FIRE !
FIRE AT WILL !
SECOND RANK, FIRE !
FALL BACK !  FALL BACK !
FIRE !  FALL BACK !
FIRE !  FALL BACK !
SECOND RANK !
THIRD RANK.
READY ?  FIRE !
CEASE FIRE !
CLOSE THE GATE !
THERE'S ONE THING FOR SURE--
HE'S A BEARCAT FOR NERVE.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
I'D HATE TO LOOK AT A COWARD
OVER A DUELING PISTOL.
YOU'RE NOT MUCH FOR THIS
FORGIVE AND FORGET BUSINESS,
ARE YOU, JIM ?
NO.
MEAT FOR SUPPER.
YES, SIR.
HOG NEVER RIGHTLY COULD PASS
FOR MEAT.  BUT BEEF !
DAVY !
LET'S GO.
LADIES TO COVER !
MEN TO YOUR POSTS !
CAPTAIN DICKINSON.
YES, SIR.
ORDER ALL MEN FED IN RELAYS.
FULL ISSUE OF AMMUNITION.
YES, SIR.
THAT'S THE BEST-DRESSED ARMY
I EVER SAW.
FANCY CLOTHES DON'T MAKE
A FIGHTIN' MAN.
THEY JUST OFF TWO YEARS
PUTTING DOWN REVOLTS.
THEY'RE FIGHTIN' MEN.
"GENERALISSIMO SANTA ANNA
HAS ARRIVED WITH
THE MAIN BODY OF HIS ARMY...
"AND HAS ONLY NOW BECOME AWARE
THAT THERE ARE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN IN THE MISSION.
"ACCORDINGLY, YOU HAVE
ONE HOUR IN WHICH TO EVACUATE
THESE NONCOMBATANTS,
"WHO WILL BE PROVIDED
WITH TRANSPORT...
"TO PROCEED TO SUCH DESTINATION
AS IS THEIR CHOICE.
SIGNED,
ANTONIO LOPEZ DE SANTA ANNA,
RULER OF MEXICO."
YOUR ANSWER ?
MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE GENERAL
FOR HIS GALLANTRY.
WE WILL EVACUATE
OUR NONCOMBATANTS.
SINGLE MEN
WILL REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS.
MARRIED MEN WILL ARRANGE
TRANSPORT FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
SUE, YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
SHE WON'T GO.
SAVE YOUR BREATH, WILL,
YOUR EVER-SO-PERSUASIVE BREATH.
ALL RIGHT, SAY IT.
IT'S A SORRY MAN THAT
CAN'T MAKE HIS WIFE OBEY.
YOU SEEM TO FORGET, DICK,
THAT I, TOO, AM MARRIED.
I'VE GOT TO DO WHAT I THINK
IS THE RIGHT THING.
I'M A SOLDIER'S WIFE.
MY CHILD IS A SOLDIER'S CHILD.
WE'LL STAY.
VERY WELL, SUE.
DICK.
DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME.
I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M PROUD.
DICK, TAKE YOUR PATROL.
YES, SIR.
MARRIED MEN,
RETURN TO YOUR POSTS.
OPEN THE GATE.
ESCORT !  FORWARD YO !
MA'AM, I AIN'T GOT NO WOMAN
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO.
COULD I TELL YOU GOOD-BYE ?
SURELY.
GET UP, BOYS.
HYAH !
JOCKO, NELL, IT'S TIME.
GO ON, JOCKO.
DO THE BEST YOU CAN.
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
I JUST CAN'T DO IT, FELLAS.
COLONEL BOWIE,
THIS IS A REQUEST
AND NOT AN ORDER.
BUT I SUGGEST THAT
AS DESPERATE AS OUR NEEDS ARE,
THAT FAMILY'S NEEDS
ARE MORE DESPERATE.
GET IN THAT LINE, JOCKO,
AND MOVE OUT WITH YOUR PEOPLE.
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT IS.
IT'S MORE THAN A MAN CAN BEAR.
SHE'S NEVER SAID A WORD
OF PITY FOR HERSELF IN
THE TEN YEARS SHE'S BEEN BLIND.
WILL TRAVIS,
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ?
MRS. ROBERTSON,
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
NO BLAME WILL ATTACH ITSELF
TO YOUR HUSBAND.
GET MOVING, JOCKO,
OR I'LL HELP YOU ALONG
WITH THE TOE OF MY BOOT.
SHUT UP, JIM BOWIE !
YOU AND TRAVIS LISTEN CLOSE.
MY MAN AIN'T GOING OUT.
HE'S JUST AS MUCH A MAN
AS EITHER OF YOU, MAYBE MORE,
JOCKO, YOU GET BACK UP
ON THAT WALL.
YOU'RE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY MAN
THAT EVER TROD LEATHER,
AND IT'S YOUR RIGHT.
AND I CAN'T SEE,
BUT I'M JUST AS GOOD
AS ANY WOMAN IN TEXAS.
AND IT'S MY RIGHT TO GO
AND LEAVE YOU.
NOW, WE'VE CUDDLED NICE
AND SAID ALL OUR GOOD-BYES.
BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.
WE'D BE FOOLS NOT TO FACE IT.
YOU'RE LIKELY TO GO
AND GET YOURSELF KILLED
IN THIS BATTLE.
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY GOING
THROUGH THE GATES OF HEAVEN,
BUT I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
NO WOMAN EVER LIVED
HAD HERSELF A BETTER HUSBAND...
THAN YOU BEEN TO ME.
NOW, GO ON !
HIP, HIP, HOORAY !
HIP, HIP, HOORAY !
HIP, HIP, HOORAY !
CAPTAIN DICKINSON ?
YES, SIR.
HAVE THE DOCTOR SET UP
THE HOSPITAL IN THE CHAPEL.
YOU WILL PERSONALLY TAKE CHARGE
OF BATTERY NUMBER FOUR.
YES, SIR.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
TAKE 'EM !
STRAIGHT FRONTAL ATTACK.
WE NEED MORE MEN UP HERE.
I'LL GET SOME STRENGTH
FROM DICKINSON.
FRONT WALL !
HURRY IT UP !
IT'S THE PARSON.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
HOLD YOUR FIRE.
THEY'RE RETIRING.
SEE DID ANY
OF OUR BOYS GET HURT.
I'LL BE BELOW
GETTING WASHED ON THE OUTSIDE
AND WET DOWN INSIDE.
WE'VE BEEN LUCKY TODAY.
CHECK THE DAMAGE.
OFFICERS' CALL
IN TEN MINUTES.
BRING ON ANOTHER.
SURE KILLED
MANY A BRAVE MAN TODAY.
FUNNY.
I WAS PROUD OF 'EM.
EVEN WHILE I WAS KILLING 'EM,
I WAS PROUD OF 'EM.
SPEAKS WELL FOR MEN
THAT SO MANY
AIN'T AFRAID TO DIE...
'CAUSE THEY THINK RIGHT
IS ON THEIR SIDE.
SPEAKS WELL.
POST THIS AREA.
IT'S ALREADY DONE.
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.
REPORT.
MORALE HIGH.
MORALE AIN'T GONNA HELP US MUCH
IF FANNIN DON'T GET HERE,
AND QUICK !
OW !  DOC !
QUIT SQUAWKIN'.
YOU OUGHT TO BE
LAYING ON YOUR BACK.
YOU'LL NEVER WALK.
SANTA ANNA DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH RESPECT FOR US TODAY,
AND HE GOT BURNED.
NOW HE'S GONNA BE COMING AT US
WITH A BATTLE PLAN
FROM ALL FOUR SIDES.
WE ALREADY BEEN CUT DOWN
BY A THIRD.  HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK WE CAN HOLD OUT ?
SANTA ANNA WON'T
ATTACK AGAIN TODAY.
HE'LL CLEAR THE FIELD
OF ALL THE DEAD AND WOUNDED.
WE KNOW THAT FANNIN WILL
BE HERE BY TOMORROW,
EVEN WITHOUT A FORCED MARCH.
WITH HIS 500 MEN,
WE CAN HOLD THIS FORT
FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.
FIVE HUNDRED ?
I THOUGHT IT WAS A THOUSAND.
FIVE HUNDRED.
WELL ?
COLONEL FANNIN ISN'T COMING.
HIS MEN WERE AMBUSHED,
MURDERED.
THERE WON'T BE ANY HELP.
HAVE ALL VOLUNTEERS ASSEMBLED
IN THE COMPOUND.
WELL, THAT'S IT.
I'M TAKING MY MEN OUT,
CUT THROUGH TO THE NORTH.
YOU COMING ?
SEEMS LIKE
THE BETTER PART OF VALOR.
MEN, JIM BONHAM HAS
BROUGHT NEWS AS SAD AS DEATH.
I STAY HERE WITH MY COMMAND.
BUT ANY OF YOU WHO WISH TO
MAY LEAVE WITH ALL HONOR.
NO MAN CAN CRITICIZE
YOUR BEHAVIOR.
HERE ON THESE RAMPARTS,
YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRICELESS
TEN DAYS OF TIME FOR HOUSTON.
YOU HAVE BLED THE ENEMY ARMY.
YOU ARE BRAVE
AND NOBLE SOLDIERS.
OPEN THE GATE.
MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
CLOSE THE GATE !
HOLD UP THERE, BUB.
YOU'RE GETTING INTO
DANGEROUS TERRITORY.
WHERE'RE YOU HEADING ?
LOOKING FOR GENERAL SAM HOUSTON.
GOT A MESSAGE FOR HIM.
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
CORPORAL OF THE GUARD !
POST NUMBER THREE !
WHAT IS IT ?
HE WANTS TO SEE GENERAL SAM.
COME ON, BUB.
THE LAD HAS A MESSAGE
FOR THE GENERAL.
YES, SIR.
YOU BETTER GET DOWN, SON,
AND GET YOURSELF SOME BEANS
AND A LITTLE SLEEP.
NO, SIR !  I'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE ALAMO.
YESTERDAY I READ YOU
COLONEL FANNIN'S MESSAGE...
TELLING US HE CANNOT REACH
THE ALAMO IN TIME.
TODAY I HAVE
FROM THE ALAMO.
THEY ARE SURROUNDED,
AND WE CAN'T HELP THEM.
WHEN YOUR RECRUITS START
TO WHINE AND BELLYACHE,
YOU TELL THEM...
THAT 185 OF THEIR FRIENDS,
NEIGHBORS, FELLOW TEXICANS...
ARE HOLED UP
IN A CRUMBLING ADOBE CHURCH
DOWN ON THE RIO BRAVO...
BUYING THEM THIS PRECIOUS TIME.
I HOPE THEY REMEMBER.
I HOPE TEXAS REMEMBERS.
IT MAY NOT BE AS COMFORTABLE,
BUT IT'S SAFER IN HERE.
WILL, I'M SORRY.
WHAT FOR ?
I GUESS I'VE SAID
SOME PRETTY RUDE THINGS TO YOU.
AT LEAST I THOUGHT THEM.
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL WOMAN,
SUE.  FORGET IT.
DICK, STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
PROBABLY WON'T NEED YOU
TILL MORNING.
I'VE ONLY ADDED
TO YOUR WORRIES, HAVEN'T I ?
I KNOW I MUST BE
VERY SELFISH.
BUT I COULDN'T THINK OF FACING
THE WORLD WITHOUT YOU.
I'M NOT THINKING.
JUST REMEMBERING.
MAN, I'VE SURE DONE
A HEAP OF THINGS
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE,
SEEMED URGENT AT THE MOMENT.
GOT MYSELF A HEAP OF SINS
TO ANSWER FOR.
WISH I HADN'T DID THEM.
I RECKON OLD SAINT PETE'S
GONNA SLAM THEM PEARLY GATES
RIGHT SMACK DAB IN MY FACE.
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU'RE MEAT FOR THE WORMS.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN NO AFTERLIFE, NO HEREAFTER ?
TALES FOR CHILDREN !
BUNKUM AND BOSH !
I SAY THIS.
I BELIEVE.
I CAN NEVER FIND A WAY
TO ARGUE DOWN
YOU THAT DON'T BELIEVE,
BUT I BELIEVE
IN THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY,
ALL KNOWING AND ALL FORGIVING.
AND I BELIEVE THAT GOOD SHALL
BE TRIUMPHANT IN THE END...
AND THAT EVIL
SHALL BE VANQUISHED.
I BELIEVE IN A HEREAFTER.
ME TOO.
I FIGURE A MAN'S GOT
TO BELIEVE IN THOSE THINGS,
DOES HE WANT TO BELIEVE IN
THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT MAN,
ABOUT HIS VERY OWN SELF.
THE REAL GOOD THINGS
LIKE COURAGE AND HONESTY...
AND LOVE.
YES, SIR ?
THIS IS SOMETHING
I PROMISED MRS. BOWIE.
KNOW WHAT IT IS ?
NO, SIR.
THAT'S YOUR FREEDOM.
YOU'RE A FREE MAN, JETH.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU BETTER GET
YOUR BELONGINGS TOGETHER
AND GET OVER THE WALL TONIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE MORE THAN
A LITTLE ROUGH AROUND HERE.
GOOD LUCK, JETH.
THANK YOU, SIR.
COLONEL BOWIE,
YOU SAY I'M A FREE MAN ?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, IF I'M FREE,
THEN I GOT A RIGHT TO DECIDE
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
SEEMS TO ME THAT'S WHAT
YOU MEN ARE FIGHTIN' FOR.
SO I RECKON...
I'LL STAY.
LOOK !
¶¶
¶¶
GENTLEMEN, GOOD LUCK.
GET TO YOUR BATTLE STATIONS.
WHAT'S THAT ?
IT'S SURE LOUD.
GET BOWIE OUT OF HERE !
GET HIM INTO THE CHAPEL !
YES, SIR !
I'M ALL RIGHT.
HOLD STILL, COLONEL BOWIE.
I SAID I'M ALL RIGHT !
COLONEL CROCKETT SAID--
DON'T START THAT !
BATTERY NUMBER THREE,
COME ON !
GET TO THE INFIRMARY.
FIRE !
CROCKETT !  CROCKETT !
NORTH WALL.
HALF OF YOU MEN THROW UP
A BARRICADE HERE.
THROW UP A BARRICADE.
GO TO THE NORTH WALL.
THIS MEAN WHAT I THINK IT DO ?
IT DO.
¶¶
WHERE'S DADDY, MOMMY ?
