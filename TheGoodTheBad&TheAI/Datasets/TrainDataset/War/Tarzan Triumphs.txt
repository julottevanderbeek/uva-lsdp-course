Come on, Cheeta.
Come on, Cheeta, get aboard.
Buli, go.
Oh, be quiet, Cheeta.
I know Tarzan said not to leave the house.
But I want to meet him.
I know it's this way. I want to see it.
Wait a minute, Buli.
Look, Cheeta.
That's Palandria,
the hidden city Tarzan told us about.
As long as we're here,
I'm gonna get a good look.
Oh, we've got plenty of time
to meet Tarzan. Come on.
- Are you all right?
- I feel fine.
- Who are you?
- I'm Boy, son of Tarzan.
Tarzan? He should take better care of you.
Oh, Tarzan is gone to Randini on
the seacoast for a letter from my mother.
She's gone across the ocean
to the great city, London.
- I've told you my name. What's yours?
- Zandra.
- Thank you, Zandra, for saving my life.
- I haven't saved it yet, Boy.
We can't go back the way we came.
Gee, Zandra, I've got you in an awful fix.
Tarzan. He's coming!
Tarzan!
Hang on, Boy. Tarzan get!
Buli!
All right, Boy.
You are a lady,
therefore you must go first.
And you are a little gentleman. Go ahead.
Why Boy not wait home like Tarzan say?
- I was gonna meet you.
- In Palandria?
This is Zandra, Tarzan.
She lives in Palandria
and she saved my life.
Zandra? Tarzan thank.
I hope I shall see you again.
Well, you see,
Tarzan doesn't like people to bother us,
so he doesn't think
we should bother other people.
Jane and Boy enough people for Tarzan.
Others always bring trouble.
- But Tarzan thank. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Come, Boy.
- Come on, Buli.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
"I must tell you,
the world is at war again."
Why men have to kill each other?
"Once more the Germans,
Nazis they call them now,
"are on the prowl.
"More ruthless than the most
savage beasts of the jungle."
I bet you could kill those Nazis, Tarzan.
Just like you killed Bolgat, the gorilla.
No.
Tarzan kill Bolgat to save Jane and Boy.
Why Tarzan kill Nazis?
No more war talk. When Jane come home?
She says she can't come home
until her mother is entirely recovered.
It may be weeks.
- It's her duty, Tarzan.
- Tarzan know. Read more.
"Goodbye, my own darlings.
I long for you so very, very much,
"more than words can say.
All my love, always, Jane."
That's all, Tarzan.
It's lonesome without her.
Lonesome? Boy sleep now.
Think of Jane. Be there in dreams.
"All my love, always, Jane."
- Why, thanks, Cheeta.
- No!
Cheeta bad. Steal from little friends.
You stole this fruit, Cheeta?
Cheeta find own good things.
Take fruit back.
Tarzan's right. Come on now.
Put it back.
Cheeta!
Show little people you're sorry.
What is it, Tarzan?
- I don't hear anything.
- Tarzan hear. Cheeta hear. Boy listen.
I hear it now.
- Iron bird come.
- Another airplane?
Iron bird go. Good.
Come, Boy, study lesson, now.
Oh, gee, Tarzan, I'd rather go swimming.
Later. Jane say Boy study every morning.
I bet I could study a lot better
in the evening.
Tarzan know best for Boy.
Tarzan mother now! Come. Get!
- Circle slowly.
- Yes, sir.
- It will just be a few moments now.
- Good.
If they have half the raw material
that you have promised, Captain Bausch,
it will be a great day for the fatherland.
You will not be disappointed,
Colonel von Reichart.
Though I was down with jungle fever
most of the time,
my eyes did not deceive me
about the wealth of oil,
tin and other resources.
That is the place to descend.
Just beyond that grove of rubber trees
lies Palandria.
Good.
Attention!
We have reached our destination.
Get ready to make the descent.
Attention! Fix your static line.
Open the door!
- Lieutenant Schmidt?
- Yes, sir.
You will tell the pilot
that he has to return to his last base
as soon as we have descended
and wait until we have built
an emergency landing field.
- I will send him further orders by radio.
- Yes, sir.
- All clear, sir.
- Good, we shall return to the base.
It's coming back.
Man come down.
What stranger want here?
LZX calling LVW.
Hello, LZX. This is LVW. Over to you.
It's Lieutenant Schmidt.
You must turn back. I'm...
I'm hurt. Separated from the others.
- It's Lieutenant Schmidt. He's hurt.
- Let's return and try to locate him.
Hold on, Lieutenant. We're turning back.
Look out!
Look out!
The propellers!
Quick, Tarzan. Quick!
Quick, Tarzan. Quick!
- Is he going to live?
- Man live. Home now.
Cheeta!
Come on, now.
- Man speak funny words.
- It's not English.
More medicine.
- Will it be long before he's well?
- Not long.
- Feel better?
- Yes. Thank you.
- You are English?
- Of course.
- Are you?
- Yes. Certainly.
Name Sheldon.
Explorer. Have trouble.
- Where Sheldon going?
- Headed north.
But I... I...
Man all right.
Cheeta try dance.
Colonel. We've searched the jungle
for miles, sir.
Not a sign of Lieutenant Schmidt.
- What of the radio?
- We couldn't find that either, sir.
- Blast. How far is it to Palandria now?
- Not over an hour.
You, Captain Bausch and the sergeant
will accompany me there.
The men will remain here.
And then you will find the radio, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel. Wait. Look.
- Amazing, here.
- Thank you.
Very interesting.
The strong always win.
Attention!
You men stay here till you get orders.
Schultz, take over.
Strangers coming! Strangers!
Welcome, strangers, to Palandria.
You invited me to return someday.
I've taken you at your word.
We are happy to see you, my friend.
And this is Colonel von Reichart.
Oman, leader of Palandria.
Zandra, his granddaughter.
I am indeed enchanted.
Oh, and Achmet, her brother.
Achmet?
- How are things with you, Achmet?
- Very well, thank you.
These are the good people
that found me in the jungle.
Oh, and I can highly recommend Zandra
as a nurse.
You always were a lucky fellow, Bausch.
Words will keep.
The jungle has been unkind to you.
You have need of rest and food.
Thank you very much.
You are very hospitable, sir,
and, if I may say so,
for a recluse people,
you speak remarkably good English.
In my youth,
I sought the knowledge of the outer world.
I fear though that I'm woefully ignorant.
For all that I learned was a language.
You mean that you have been
isolated here
and cut off from the outside world
ever since?
Yes, and content that it should be so.
Gentlemen, my home is at your disposal.
Yes, long ago, our ancestors
dwelled in a far-off land,
in what you would call civilization.
Then came barbarians
who envied their happiness,
driving them from their homes,
looting their treasures of art and science,
despoiling them of everything.
Everything but faith.
Our ancestors prayed for aid
to the master of the sun.
He offered them hope.
So inspired, they set forth across
the mountains, the jungles and the deserts
until they came to this valley
and founded Palandria.
A haven of peace.
Your country has a very interesting
and appealing history.
And you, dear lady, if I were the ruler,
would be my choice for its future queen.
That's very gallant of you, Colonel.
You are very fascinating, my dear.
You will excuse me, please.
Yes, Sergeant?
Your orders have been obeyed, sir.
Everything is in readiness.
Excellent. Wait till the town is asleep
and then take up your positions.
Yes, sir.
But, Sergeant,
we cannot interrupt this charming
little interlude here, can we?
No, sir.
Then, Sergeant, the advent
of the new order for Palandria
- will take place in the morning.
- Yes, Colonel.
Look alive, you, and go to work!
Get them going, men, and going fast!
- Move on!
- Move on!
The Palandrians may be poor fighters,
but they are excellent workers.
- They will do. Sergeant?
- Colonel.
Any news of the radio?
None yet, Colonel,
but they are still searching.
Let us hope that the plane starts looking
for us when we do not communicate.
At least we'll have a landing field
ready for them.
Faster!
What's the delay over there, Sergeant?
Get them going.
Yes, Colonel. What's the delay over there?
What is this? Get up! Get up.
Get up, you, back to work.
One, two! One, two!
- So this is how you repay our kindness.
- My dear girl, this is war.
We found you helpless,
near death in the jungle.
We cared for you,
and now you show your gratitude
by bringing these jackals
to despoil our land and people.
- Hold your tongue, young woman!
- Don't.
My dear Fräulein, we are soldiers
of the Reich. We merely do our duty.
You have oils, many minerals
vital to our victory.
Must you steal them from us?
You are far too beautiful to act like a child.
A new day has dawned, my dear.
A new era.
Accept it and you will share in its glory.
Reject it and...
Well, I am quite sure you are
just as intelligent as you are lovely.
We have harmed no one,
Colonel von Reichart.
Please go. Leave us in peace.
In rage or supplication
you are equally enchanting.
How dare you!
Achmet! Achmet!
Achmet.
Come, Zandra. Hurry. Come.
Wait until they've reached the crest
of the hill. You cannot miss then.
Be careful.
We got to bring the girl back unharmed.
Colonel von Reichart's orders.
Omar. Omar.
Cheeta, give me that coil.
Come, Cheeta. Nice Cheeta.
This beast...
Here, have some of this fruit.
It's delicious. Here. I'll trade.
LZX calling Berlin. LZX calling Berlin.
Hello, LZX. This is Berlin. Over to you.
This is Reinhardt Schmidt,
radio operator
in Colonel von Reichart's expedition.
We've reached destination.
Our plane on way back crashed.
I'm separated from the others
but will join them as soon as possible.
Colonel von Reichart building
emergency landing field.
Expects full battalion
and transport planes.
Hold them ready to send.
We'll guide you with radio,
otherwise Palandria impossible to find.
It's located at...
Cheeta! Come back here, you ugly brute!
I said come back!
Mr. Sheldon.
We've picked some more fruit for you.
Well, what's the matter?
That pet of yours has stolen
part of my radio again.
Cheeta. Here, Cheeta, give it to me.
Here you are, Mr. Sheldon.
Will you get some music?
Yes, yes, but first I must call my base
to send a plane for me.
No! Tarzan want no more people come.
But I've got to get out of here.
Soon be well enough.
Tarzan take to Randini.
You set great store by your privacy,
don't you, Tarzan?
People have always brought us trouble.
You're completely happy living here alone?
Tarzan happy when Jane come home.
Tarzan like jungle.
Jungle people only fight to live.
Civilized people live to fight.
The perfect isolationist.
What's that?
Isolationists are people
who are very self-sufficient.
They think they don't need
the rest of the world.
Tarzan.
Somebody's shooting!
- Zandra.
- Tarzan.
I had to come to you, Tarzan.
You must help me. You must.
They will kill me!
Give it to me, Hans.
Tarzan fix them.
Swine.
You breathed down my neck
and spoiled my aim.
Cannibal fish.
We go overhead.
Zandra safe now.
- Who those men?
- Germans.
They are making slaves of my people.
Germans? Nazis!
Man like that with Boy! Come, quick.
And now can you do this?
Cheeta, give me that coil.
Cheeta! Cheeta. Give it to me.
Cheeta!
Cheeta.
Come back here.
Come down from there!
Boy!
Mr. Sheldon, no! Let Cheeta alone!
- Run, Cheeta, run!
- Get away from me!
Boy!
Boy!
Boy!
Tarzan!
Boy! Boy all right?
- Mr. Sheldon, he's trying to kill Cheeta.
- Cheeta?
Cheeta all right?
Buli all right?
Nazi hyena dead now.
Tarzan!
Zandra? What's she doing here?
Talk later.
- Boy, get medicine.
- Yes, Tarzan.
Tarzan...
- Zandra rest now.
- But I can't rest now.
- There's so much I have to tell you.
- No talk. Drink!
- But I must tell you. The Nazis...
- Drink.
Good. Drink have jungle medicine.
Make sleep.
But I don't want to sleep now.
Talk tomorrow. Sleep now.
She still sleeps. Good.
Isn't she beautiful?
Boy sleep now.
But, Tarzan... Where are you gonna sleep?
Come.
- But that's my bed.
- Boy's bed, Cheeta's bed, Tarzan's bed.
Good thing elephant sleep in corral.
Oh, what I went through.
Poor Lieutenant Schmidt and Grüber
and Hans. They are all dead.
- Dead?
- Yes.
I found Lieutenant Schmidt's diary,
and when you see the...
Why do I talk to you?
Why do you bring me Schmidt's diary
and not the radio?
I found his body
at the foot of the escarpment, sir.
And when I read in the diary
about the plane crash, sir,
I thought you ought to know
as soon as possible.
Idiot. All I want to know is about the radio.
Without it, we'll rot here!
But the diary says
the jungle man has the radio
and he is worse than a wild beast.
I can see I must handle the matter myself.
And you will accompany us,
Sergeant, at once!
But I'm exhausted, sir. I must have rest.
- Soldiers of the Reich never rest.
- Heil Hitler.
But you do not understand, Tarzan.
The Nazis are your enemies, too.
- One hurt Boy, tried to shoot Cheeta.
- He dead now.
But the others...
Others leave Boy and Tarzan alone,
Tarzan leave them alone.
But they won't,
and as long as they are here,
Boy will never be safe.
Tarzan stay, protect Boy like Jane say.
Oh, Tarzan.
You don't need to worry about me.
I want you to go with Zandra
and fight those Nazis.
No!
But Zandra saved my life.
Tarzan saved Zandra's life. Pay back.
Tarzan swim now.
Don't worry, Zandra.
He'll change his mind about helping you.
Sure he will.
Sometimes he's like that with Jane.
But she knows how to get her way.
That's it. Come on.
Jane.
Smile. Wave to him.
Zandra.
Zandra swim?
Go on, swim with him.
Zandra!
Oh, this is like paradise.
Tarzan glad Zandra like.
Palandria was such a paradise, too,
before they came.
It's working.
It just takes time.
Can you cook?
Yes.
Come on.
Zandra cooked dinner for you.
Looks good.
- How is it?
- Tastes good.
I'm glad you like my cooking.
Would you like some more?
More.
I bet Zandra will come over
and cook for us often
after you've driven those Nazis away.
So!
What's the matter?
Zandra tried to bribe Tarzan.
No!
Zandra?
- Good morning, Zandra.
- Boy, what are you doing here?
I'm just taking my morning walk.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going home, Boy,
back to my own people.
But you can't go through the jungle alone.
You know, if Tarzan's so stubborn
about it, I'll help you.
Tarzan would be angry, Boy.
Please let me go with you.
I'm a good shot with my sling.
I have a knife.
I can fight the Nazis.
I know.
You are my little friend.
If I ask you to do something for me,
- will you do it?
- Sure.
Then go back.
Zandra will never forget.
Goodbye, Boy.
Tarzan, Tarzan!
Zandra's gone!
Zandra?
Gone?
- Where?
- She's on her way home alone.
Boy stay. Tarzan get.
We've got a fearful climb
ahead of us, Colonel.
- Couldn't we rest just a minute or two?
- Certainly not. We proceed at once.
Zandra!
- Why Zandra leave now?
- My place is in Palandria.
- Zandra stay here.
- No, Tarzan.
Tarzan say yes.
- I must return to help my people.
- Come back till Nazis go away.
They will never go away.
I must go.
Zandra very stubborn.
Tarzan know best.
Come, please.
I tell you, I don't know!
You little devil.
- Where is the coil of that radio?
- I tell you, I don't know.
Tell me!
- Sergeant, bring him here.
- Yes, sir.
Come on!
Not so rough, Sergeant,
you'll hurt the boy.
Well, I can see you're quite
a bright little fellow.
We don't mean you any harm.
We only want the radio part,
so that we can talk to our people.
I don't know anything about it.
- Colonel, it's not here, sir.
- You have searched everywhere?
We've torn the place apart, sir.
You force me to be unpleasant.
Boy!
Hurry, Tarzan, hurry.
Very well.
- Where is Zandra and that jungle man?
- I don't know.
Speak, you.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.
He is coming. Let us welcome him.
Yes, sir.
Tarzan, go back! Go back, go back!
Boy!
Open fire.
Open fire.
Tarzan!
- I am sure he fell here.
- Oh, no, sir. He couldn't have.
See those monkeys playing?
They would've been frightened off.
He must have fallen into the ravine,
and that's the end of him.
You should've been
in the Gestapo, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, you are always so sure.
Bring the boy.
We return to Palandria at once.
- He'll talk.
- Fall in.
Cheeta!
Tarzan.
Tarzan.
He's alive, Cheeta. Alive.
I'm here, Boy.
- Boy.
- Tarzan.
Zandra.
Tarzan dream.
You had a terrible fall,
and I gave you the jungle medicine
to make you sleep,
just as you gave it to me.
Now Tarzan remember.
Nazis.
Where Boy?
They took him away, Tarzan.
Took away? Boy?
Now Tarzan make war.
- Tarzan go find Boy now.
- I'm going with you.
No, Zandra safe here. Tarzan bring Boy.
Cheeta!
Tarzan.
Boy all right?
So the jungle man lived, huh?
Drop that knife.
I said drop it!
Sergeant, shoot the boy
if he makes another move.
Yes, sir.
- Tie them both up, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, you.
Over here.
Stand, or I'll fire.
Well, good man, Carsten.
- Bring her to my headquarters.
- Yes, sir!
Did you bring the radio part with you?
Where is the radio part?
- Sergeant.
- Sir?
See that the guard is doubled immediately
and if they still remain stubborn,
order a firing squad
for 6:00 in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Remember, jungle man,
the strong always win!
Tarzan, what is a firing squad?
It is I who am to blame,
Colonel von Reichart.
They have chosen to defy the power
and dignity of the Reich, my dear.
They must be shown
the inevitable consequences of that.
If you must make an example of someone,
make it of me.
Take my life instead of theirs.
My dear Zandra,
you are very courageous.
But very, very foolish.
I don't want your life, Zandra.
All I want is your friendship
and companionship,
and if you'll give them to me
we will share the glory
of the new day together.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Yes, Colonel.
The young lady wishes
to join her friends, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Come.
The rope is strong.
Get in here!
Zandra.
Why Zandra not wait like Tarzan say?
I had to try to help you.
Oh, Tarzan, forgive me for bringing
this trouble on you and Boy.
Nazis bring trouble, not Zandra.
Release Zandra!
This revolt shall be punished.
Take every tenth man.
They will die before a firing squad
in the morning.
- Don't take him away.
- Father.
- Open up!
- Come out.
Please let him go. Please!
Master of the Sun,
our eyes are turned to you.
For in this dark hour
we are bereft of all human aid.
Therefore, we humbly beseech you
for deliverance of those
who are soon to die.
Ten minutes more,
and the firing squad will relieve us.
It's no use. She can't do it.
Tarzan sent her to try and get his knife
from the Sergeant.
But he'll kill her.
Yes, Colonel von Reichart. Yes, I'll come...
What...
I'll get you. I'll get you.
Good Cheeta.
- Come.
- Wait.
Take gun. Kill Nazis.
LZX calling Berlin. LZX calling Berlin.
Fight Nazis!
Take care of this.
It's our only chance of getting help.
Bausch.
Bausch.
Look!
Nazi!
Nazi!
Nazi!
LZX calling Berlin.
LZX calling Berlin.
LZX calling Berlin. Go ahead, Berlin.
Nazi.
Nazi.
Nazi.
Tarzan here, Nazi.
Gun no more good.
Take knife, Nazi.
Come, Nazi.
Here, Nazi.
In jungle, strong always win.
Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Zandra!
Boy!
- I've got them now.
- Good.
General Hoffman,
we have contacted them.
I'll talk to them myself.
Come in, Colonel von Reichart.
Here is General Hoffman.
Idiot!
It is not von Reichart.
