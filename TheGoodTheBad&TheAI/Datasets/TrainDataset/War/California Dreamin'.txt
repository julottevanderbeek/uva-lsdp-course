On 25 August '06 director Cristian
Nemescu was killed in a car crash.
You are about to watch his movie
just the way it looked at the time.
In memory of Cristian Nemescu
MEDlAPRO PlCTURES presents
A film produced with the support
of the National Film Centre
May 1944
The British and American armies
are still engaged
in bombing Romania.
Their aim is to undermine
the government's determination
to remain
the ally of Germany.
The number of casualties
among the military,
and especially
among the civilians, is increasing.
Cut it out.
We are hereby urging
the population to strictly follow
the rules of civil
defense in case of bombing.
Upon the first warning signs,
take immediate refuge in shelters.
- C'mon! C'mon, already!
- C'mon, already!
- But where's Grandpa?
- We forgot Grandpa.
Attention! Do not panic!
Don't waste your time
trying to locate valuable items
that you might want to save
from destruction.
Yes, sugar pie, it's not that
I don't want to come home,
we've had this conversation before.
There are days when I just
have more work to do.
Come on,
I'm not having an affair...
Hold on just a second,
there's a call on the other line.
Wait. No,
don't call me back later.
Hold on, I'll get Luiza to
pick it up. Yes, Luiza's here.
Come on, honey... here we go again
with why she's here.
She's here because she's got work
to do. Wait, there's another call.
These raids, the first after
April 6, put the Podgorica leaders,
who enjoy Western support,
in a tight spot.
They have to face the increasingly
numerous anti-NA TO demonstrations.
Luiza! Come on, what are you
doing? The phone's ringing.
Talk to you later.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
office of the State Secretary.
The Yugoslav Federation was
bombed again, yesterday.
Wait, don't put her on the phone.
Yes.
How's my little princess?
Now, I just talked to mommy
and she told me
you haven't finished your milk...
Ok, put mommy back on the phone.
Look, something urgent has
come up, I have to go.
I'll call you later, ok?
Bye.
- What?
- NATO's calling.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Have them call the minister.
Well, they said he's gone,
he's already left.

Fall in line!
C'mon!
C'mon, already!
Ready to go?
These guys are stalling with
their bloody engine.
Some uniforms you got...
Fit us like gloves.
They're for special ops.
Can't feel the cold, can't feel
the heat in 'em. NATO standards.
Marian! Come here!
Tell the American commander
you'll be doing the translating.
He wants to take a look around.
- You're the boss.
- Me, me...
He has a deadline.
And we have to go quickly.
Let's attach the engine
to the wagon and get it over with.
He wants it done fast.
He is in a hurry.
- He's asking you nicely.
- Marching band!
The Yugoslavian news agency
reported that NATO missiles have hit
Bosnian and Croatian refugee camps
in Marcici, south Belgrade.
The Serbian press claims
that the bombing
has damaged yet another bridge
across the Danube.
- Hello!
- H i! You came to pick Monica up?
- I'm giving her a ride to school.
- Your father bought you this car?
Yeah. You like it?
It's the coupe model...
I'm thinking of running for mayor
myself, if the money's so good...
Let me go see if she's up.
What do you want?
Your prince is here.
Yeah!
Morning, sir.
Spit it out.
Boss, the 9:30 freight train is
on its way.
Help yourself to some chicken,
my daughter's not eating.
- You got the items list?
- Got it.
Morning, miss.
Come!
- How's it going, princess?
- Tell me what you're doing here.
I thought we'd agreed we weren't
going to see each other anymore.
Hold on, I thought you re kidding
or playing me, stuff like that...
Baby, come on, I was crystal clear.
That's it. It's over.
Es finito, comprende?
So aren't you at least going
to tell me what happened?
Nothing happened.
That's the whole point.
You changed the spokes
on the car's wheels, eh?
That's it for today.
Take good care of the parcels.
Boss, on the 2 o'clock train we've
got 1 0 boxes of 3.5 ball bearings.
We're selling those at 500 a pop.
say we send those to Galati.
I took PVC, double glazings,
wire and some other stuff in bulks
I reckoned we'd sell those
on the local market.
On the 8 o'clock freight train
we've got 1 0 cases of beer,
wine, soda and stuff,
we'll sell those through
Gelu's supermarket.
And so on... cigarettes, we've got
Take out more. They won't
catch us, the goddamn asses.
And don't go selling them to Gelu,
he pays after selling the stuff.
It's ok, I've got a new deal
all set. Next?
Right. Paint, cement... 1 00 each.
Spare Dacia parts from the
And then there's the fertilizer
on the Valcea freight train.
- I promised the mayor 20 sacks.
- I see...
I'm guessing it all adds up
to about 40 million.
This is the one for the factory.
- For the factory, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, aren't they closing the damn
thing down? So I can buy it.
Come on. Take a decent share
from every car.
We'll record them as losses
Man, these gypsies are killing us.
They emptied half a car again.
And I'm the one who always gets
the blame...
I'll catch them! I'll teach them
a lesson to stop stealing.
Isn't anyone going to answer
that phone?
- Capalnita station.
- Constanta station calling.
I'd like to speak to the shift
supervisor, please.
- Speaking.
- Yes? Hello!
A train carrying NATO equipment
will pass through your station.
It's guarded by American soldiers.
- Yes, I understand.
- It's been granted free passage.
Listen carefully!
Don't make any problems!
They have government approval.
Don't make any problems!
I'd like to feel your hot skin
under my lips. I love you.
It's me. Listen, a train
with Americans is on its way.
I don't know, just about now.
In, like, fifteen minutes.
Okay, man. I got it. Thanks.
Hey, guys, listen up!
Gather round.
Tell all the guys to come to work.
We're going on immediate strike.
Yeah! Great!
Doiaru wants to put us
out of work
so he can buy the factory
real cheap.
The time has finally come
to make ourselves heard!
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Victor, come over here.
By the power vested in me...
Excuse me. Yes.
Hello, sir.
You've got yourself a problem.
A train with Americans will pass
and the word is out.
Good thing you called me. Yes.
I'll be right there.
By the power vested in me, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.
Come on, sign here. I have to go.
Kiss the wife.
Cut it out!
Here!
Come on, guys! Come on!
We're not going home till somebody
hears us. Come on, move it.
Trifan, you're in charge of
holding that banner up and across.
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
Come on, Trifan!
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
STRlKE
Give us our money!
We want our money!
What's going on here, folks?
Are you out of your minds?
We're picketing,
we've gone on immediate strike.
On the railroad tracks?
Listen, guys, a train with
Americans is on its way.
You want us to make fools
of ourselves?
We know. That's why we're doin' it.
Maybe somebody will hear us out.
So what if Doiaru hears you?
The investor bailed out cause
Doiaru looted the factory trains.
We've filed for bankruptcy and you
ain't doing squat about it, Mayor!
Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
Boss...
A train with Americans is headed
our way.
Some big shots or something.
Carrying NATO military equipment.
Bucharest has granted them
free passage.
Maybe, but I'm the boss here.
Have them stop for a check-up.
Folks, people are going to hear
bad things about us.
Clear the railroad tracks and I'll
buy all the oil in your factory.
God bless you, Mr. Mayor!
We'll not sell ourselves so cheap!
We're going all the way, brothers!
All the way! Thieves!
Thieves! Thieves!
Give us our money!
You know what? You're free
to do whatever you want.
That's why we've got
democracy, right?
Good afternoon. Dorel Mateescu.
Doiaru. Railroad station master.
What's your freight
car carrying?
Well... it's American military cargo.
Headed for Kosovo.
It's a NATO car.
And its content is top secret.
- I want to see your papers.
- Well, don't you get it?
It's military cargo.
We've got approval from high up,
from the Government.
No, you're the one who doesn't get
it. I have regulations to observe.
Without proper paperwork
I can't let you pass.
The officer would like to know
if there's a problem.
... and those pricks in Bucharest.
This is my station.
Without them, you re not passing!
Enough said. Put them on track 2!
What's going on here?
Check out what s happening!
Mister, what do you think
you're doing?
You hang around here, I'm going
upstairs to take care of business.
Day One - The Train
Day One - The Train
So, how long have you had
your bags packed?
So, had you got on that train, you
would've gone to Craiova? Pitesti?
Couldn't I have just as well asked
Petre to take you there?
If only your mother were alive
to see you today...
What, you think it's got nothing
to do with that? It has, dammit!
If she hadn't died when you were
born she could've told you herself.
I don't even know how you could
think of such a thing!
What, I don't take
good care of you?
Everything you've got here
in this room...
Tape recorder, clothes, records,
whims Who gave you those, dammit?
Sometimes when I look at you,
I can swear it's her that I see.
Well, maybe that's just it.
You women are all alike.
I can understand why you'd want
to leave this shit hole of a village.
Start studying! Maybe next fall
you'll go to college, in the city!
What the hell!
You're smart. You're beautiful.
I'm going to end up alone anyway,
but that's just the way it is.
Shouldn't you be in school
right now?
- Yeah, I should.
- I'll have Petre drop you off.
Fuckin' son of a bitch!
What are we gonna do, man?
Go home?
No way! We're going
to carry on with the strike.
Screw me, we do that every day.
Okay, Mitroi...
Heard the news? The Americans
have come to our village.
- Go on, sonny-boy...
- The Americans are in our village.
- Well, how... Where? How?
- They're at the railroad station.
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah! Go see for yourselves.
Have you heard?
The Americans...
Yes, here, in our village.
- The Americans...
- I saw the Americans...
- Does the mayor know about it?
- Well, of course he does!
Did everybody see a new episode
of "Esmeralda" last night?
- Yes!
- Okay.
Today we're going to study two
verbs: "quiero" and "trabajar".
Let's read out loud, come on!
Quiero ir al teatro,
pero no tengo tiempo.
Write down the translation:
"l want to go to the theatre,
but I don't have the time."
Who would like to conjugate
"trabajar"?
So many of you?
You want me to call someone out?
Go ahead, Despina.
Trabajo, trabajas, trabaja,
trabajamos, trabajais, trabajan.
Good... Now, using the same
inflection,
Iet's try "quiero".
Who wants to give it a go? You!
Quiere... quiero...
No, no. Neagu, you try!
I yearn for the blossom of your
breasts. Your beauty makes me ache.
Stop! Attention everybody!
"Es" is the inflection
for the second person, singular.
For the first person, we use
the inflection "o".
Everybody look at the blackboard,
please! The correct conjugation is...
- American soldiers in our village!
- Young guys?
I don't know, but we gotta go
take a look after class.
Yo quiero means "l love you"
then we have:
tu quieres, el, ella quiere,
nosotros queremos, vosotros quereis,
ellos, ellas quieren
They say a train with Americans
has arrived!
So, if you say "quiero bailar"
it means "l want to dance".
"Quiero irme a casa",
"l want to go home".
And now, attention!
To say "l love you", add,
like in Romanian, the pronoun "te".
As you know from the movies,
"yo te quiero" means "l love you".
Don't forget to watch
the 395th episode of "Esmeralda"!
- Tonight!
- Wait, I wanna tell you something!
So. Ladies, young ladies
and, well, the rest of you,
to celebrate the
end of this boredom,
or, as the great scholar Gogu
would call it, "the 1 2th grade",
I'm inviting you all to a great
party, the day after tomorrow.
There are going to be chicks,
booze, cool music, all that stuff.
So everyone's invited to my
uncle's, in the city!
Everyone!
Listen, aren't you guys
together anymore?
He was starting to piss me off.
Going on and on
with "Baby, you're so fine".
That sort of crap.
None of them is good enough
for you anymore, huh?
- Hey! Where's the boss?
- Hello, Mayor.
Hello. Where's the boss of
the Americans?
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.
I wanna talk to their boss.
I'm the mayor.
Here he is.
It's okay, it's okay,
I'll do the translating.
- Tell the colonel that...
- It's "captain".
Tell the captain that we're very
happy to invite him
and the rest of the
wonderful guests...
... to celebrate the anniversary
of our village, tomorrow evening.
- Tomorrow night, you told him?
- Yeah, I told him.
- Mr. Mayor!
- Oh, hi.
Long time no see
in these here parts.
Well, what can I do, I'm so damn
busy. You can see for yourself.
I gotta... The stuff I asked you
about, those sacks of cement...
- How's that going?
- Oh, it's been taken care of.
I just need some guys to come by
later on, to go pick up the sacks.
Praise the Lord.
What's that I heard?
The radio guy said you wanted
to buy the factory...
What's up with that?
My daughter's all grown up now.
She needs a nice dowry, you see?
Good for you. If she and Paul
are getting along well...
Let's get together one day,
talk things over.
Listen up, we're having a meeting
at the village hall in an hour.
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.
- It's the village anniversary.
- Wasn't that a month ago?
- So what if it was?
Girl, that guy is so cute!
Now, who keeps texting you, girl?
Aww, girl!
He kind of looks like
Ricky Martin, doesn't he?
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
You can. Good afternoon.
Dear fellow villagers,
as you well know
or as you may have heard...
or seen...
a train carrying American soldiers
arrived in our village today.
Apparently, from what Mr. Doiaru
has told me,
there are some paperwork issues
in Bucharest...
None of our business, anyway.
So till the papers get sorted out,
it is our duty, both as citizens
and as good Christians,
as God fearing people... to warmly
welcome our guests from overseas.
As far as village affairs go,
the arrival of the Americans
can only do us good.
Because, if we get publicity,
we will draw new investors
to our village.
Yeah, so Doiaru
can rip them off, too!
Not to mention that our guests
are potential investors too.
We will welcome them into our pubs
and our hotels.
And we'll all benefit from this.
I'm hereby announcing
the anniversary
of our village's 1 00th year,
tomorrow evening.
Didn't we do that, already?
I know we've done that already,
but we're going to do it again.
There's going to be barbecue, beer,
everything it takes to make sure
it comes out nice.
And he keeps staring at her.
So she's gulping down the food
and at some point the guy goes,
"Ma'am, you eat like a sow."
And she goes...
Yes, honey.
Okay, I'll call you back later.
Something important has come up.
- When did this come in?
- Just now.
- So, what do they want from me?
- Haven't got a clue.
Well, send it over to Defense.
See, it says here "urgent".
Okay.
And don't forget
to call the NATO guys.
Yeah, yeah.
Tell them it's all going
to be taken care of.
Okay.
The Ministry of National Defense
It's not our problem.
It's for the Ministry of Transportation.
The Ministry of Transportation
Yeah, we'll clear it up, but...
I don't think it's going to make
it there today.
But it'll be there tomorrow. Yes.
Good day, sir.
Claudia, change the header,
so that I can sign it. Quickly!
The Board of the Romanian
Railway Company
- There's no more room!
- Go! Go!
Day Two - The Village
Day Two - The Village
And that's the story of the first
black man I ever saw.
I was but a boy back then,
but I'll never forget
how the simple countryman,
the Romanian peasant, welcomed
this stranger warmly.
And we are all capable of such
deeds, us Romanians.
Mr. Mayor, what happened
with the black guy?
Well, you see, kids...
At first, people didn't even
realize he was American.
Because we know that black people
live in Africa.
Only afterwards did we find out
that America's full of blacks.
But in those days,
people didn't fear differences
in appearance, so to speak.
They offered the poor man shelter
for two weeks.
Until we chased the Germans away.
But, meanwhile, the poor guy died
because he was badly injured
and we didn't know how to cure him.
Okay. Now let's talk a bit about
the history of the United States.
Or, for short, America.
Or, even shorter, the USA.
The country's capital
is located in Washington.
But that's not the largest city,
you know.
The largest cities are LA,
New York...
and so on.
The country is made up of states.
Such as Texas, California...
Anyway, just like our country
is made up of counties.
Such as llfov, lalomita, Vaslui,
Bacau and so on.
The country's economy relies on...
... seduction.
It's all about seduction.
Sure, it also depends
on what you wear.
A short skirt and a big cleavage
will always draw all eyes to you.
That's where intelligence comes in.
Namely, your demeanor.
My advice is that you be...
...open, but without giving
in to their first offer.
This is the time for us to
speak up, without fear,
to tell them what we really want
and who we are.
That's right!
I want us to hold a civilized
protest tonight, at the mayor's party
Now, you're all going
to bring banners.
We're going to write down
clearly what we want.
That is, "Give us our money!".
"You thieves!", "We want to work!"
"We're hungry!"... and so on.
Good morning, dear listeners
of this wonderful community.
To honor the event that all of you
have certainly heard about,
we re kicking off a program of
musical bonding, so to speak,
with Romanian music
and sweet
American songs for the soul,
meant to bring us a bit of warmth,
not that it's not hot enough.
What I mean is the warmth
in our hearts and souls.
Right... On the other hand,
a well-informed citizen
was kind enough to inform us
this whole village anniversary,
which is actually made up,
is closely connected
to our mayor's wish to raise
some money for the local budget.
They say that the budget has been
depleted of some massive sums.
Moving on, I have here a list
of musical requests.
I will begin reading them now.
Mihai.
Monica.
- lonescu.
- I noticed you like Monica.
You don't stand a chance.
For sure. She's only gone steady
with the coolest guys around.
She got bored of them all.
She was with Alex, the metal-head.
He was one of them angry rockers.
Then Mihai, the guy who graduated
last year... my sister's crush.
Anyway, he went off to college
in Bucharest. The end.
She dumped that guy ages ago. And
yesterday she cut Paul loose.
- Come on, you pick him!
- I'm not picking that geek!
We reshuffle the teams
and I'll pick him, man.
Dude, check out your team!
You take him! Andrei!
Move it! You're on his team.
We're taking the other one.
Ok? Come on,
you've got a killer team.
- Move it!
- Come on, pass it!
You passed it to this dweeb?!
He can't even move his feet?!
And he's playing in his PJ s, too!
C'mon girls! Put everywhere!
Yo, Mihai! Get it over with
those lights, already, will you?
Well, those lights...
Don't touch!
Leave them like this!
Bless you!
Doiaru, you should really take
something for your allergy.
Dear Vasile, I've got something
I wanna ask of you.
Anything, Mr. Doiaru.
I've got it covered. Go ahead.
Well, there's this gang of gypsies,
they really get my goat!
Everyday they're out stealing from
freight trains. There,by the turn.
You could have your men guard them.
They get so bored anyway.
I got it. Listen, Doiaru,
we've known each other for ages.
What's with these Americans?
I'm not saying it's a bad thing,
but...
The mayor is out throwing
parties and all...
Well if they don't have the papers
what am I supposed to do about it?
Just because they're American
they think they can outsmart us?
Like we're Romanians, so we're
all morons, or what?
They have to obey the law.
Hey, Stelica! Watch it!
- Boss! Boss!
- What's up?
- This is 1-7.
- I know, man. Go ahead.
Hold on, it's for me.
Go ahead! What's up?
The mayor is calling you over
to put up road blocks.
Come on, man. I started
the barbecue. You comin'?
Of course I am.
I'll see you at the party.
Vasile, you're not gonna forget
about that thing we discussed, ok?
Of course not,
didn't I tell you already?
He wants to know if those customs
papers have arrived.
No, nothing's come in.
Tell the man I don't take bribe.
What, you think
if we're in Romania
you can buy us out just like that?
Third world country, right?
Yo, Marin, you're so snazzy, girl!
Hey, suck my dick!
Yes!
I came to take the Americans
to the party.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hold on, I'll go tell them.
Good evening! Please, Captain...
He's father Nicolae!
My deputy!
- Soda, Mayor?
- Oh, give me a break!
Where are you? Here you go!
C'mon!
Leave me alone!
- Mr. Mayor, God bless you!
- God bless!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
honorable community officials,
dear fellow villagers
I have the utmost pleasure
and honor
to bid you all welcome to the
anniversary of our village...
This year, we are privileged
to have among us
a few distinguished guests
from abroad,
who have come all the way
from the United States of America!
This being said,
let's have some Romanian fun!
Change the station already,
I've had enough of this asshole!
You tell me, how can anyone
not hate these Americans?
Hello.
Yes. No...
I can't hear you.
Hello? I can't hear you.
Speak up, please!
- Yes... Hello.
- Who's there?
Yes, yes, hello, Minister.
Yes, yes, hello, Minister.
Yes, they're right here with us.
We're at a party.
Yes, yes...
No...
That's not up to me, sir.
Well, see...
The station is administered by
the Romanian Railway Company.
And the man in charge of the
station is Mr. Doiaru.
Yes, but I promise you
that I'll make sure
their stay here will be hassle-free.
Good bye!
I just got a call from the Minister.
Good evening!
It is my great pleasure
to introduce to you
the instrumental music group,
"Band of the Universe".
Together with yours truly,
Nicky "Priceless",
the ambassador
of traditional music,
we're inviting you to dance.
"Trade romale"!
