I am afraid of fighting
I am afraid of being beaten
and losing
But I am more afraid of
surviving as a cripple
than dying while I am fighting!
I hear the wind howl
I hear the fear inside of me

END OF THE PACIFIC WAR - 1945
A
Stop!
That ' s how I began to dream
of being a pilot
But the end of the Pacific War
ended my dream
Stop!
You'll be dead
The end of the war
was driving people mad
Who are they?
They ' re Koreans who refused
to fly in the Kamikaze
Let them go!
But
Y es, sir!
The Kamikaze is a sacred ceremony
We can 't stain it
with the blood of Koreans
You bastards!
You ' re just using us
as human shields
When did you teach us
how to fly?
Shit!
Who the hell are you?
What insolence
you Korean!
How dare you defy
His Majesty's rule?
Fine, shoot me
Pilot? Aviation school?
I don 't give a damn anymore
Go ahead, you bastards!
Stop it
Not bad for a greenhorn
What's that silly skill?
It's called Taekkyeon
a Korean martial art
Korean martial arts?
Let me make an offer
If you defeat me in a fight, I ' ll
let you and your friends live
But if you lose, I 'll
only kill you Gruesomely
What do you think?
It seems you care
about your life indeed
Baedal!
Are you scared?
Showing your back in a fight
you certainly are Korean
You don ' t have enough honor
to learn martial arts
Baedal, Baedal!
Wake up!
And so that year passed...
Japan surrendered unconditionally
because of the atomic bomb
And my country was liberated
However, only devastation was left
after the war ended
Similarly, my courage was left
in ruins after that defeat
Give me a chocolate
Give me a chocolate
Give me a chocolate

Bastard!
Bumsoo
Baedal
Bumsoo, I 'm sorry to show myself
to you like this
greatest circus!
Can you have ti see it
Man on the fly
beautiful women on the swing
A man walking on the rope
Here, have some soup
Oh, kimchi Great!
It ' s been quite long
By the way, those yakuzas
do you know them?
You cannot avoid dealing with them
when you' re the guard for a circus
They ' re extra trouble for a troupe
Iike ours, with lots of Koreans
Aren 't those ration tickets?
They' re as good as money
Why don 't you use them
instead of just collecting them?
We are planning to build a school
for the Korean kids in this area
They shouldn ' t forget our language
even though they've left Korea
I see
Baedal, how are your parents?
Bumsoo!
Teach me
how to be a fighter
Bumsoo wouldn ' t give up his will
Baedal must be very cold
You, poor thing!
Baedal!
Bumsoo!
Baedal, if you make a fist
you can ' t grasp anything
not friends, not earth
nor sky
But if you unclench your fist
you can hold the whole world
Baedal, practice martial arts hard
to protect yourself
Bumsoo, why are you saying that?
You understand what I mean?
Get him!
Follow him!
Get him!
Shoot!
Get him!
Little master, use your abilities
to protect yourself and others
Live fairly, and protect
the things you care about
What ' s he doing?
I remember he said he would never
teach the martial arts as they can be
as deadly as poison
Well, he must be different
from someone
Damn
What? How rude you are
to an old lady like me!
Bastard!
BOOK OF FIVE RINGS
BY MIYAMOTO MUSASHI
Justice without power is empty but
power without justice is only
violence
A warrior always keeps
his sword sharp but he never
draws it without a cause
Miyamoto Musashi
the best swordsman ever
will be a good teacher for you
Pachinko!
Pachinko!
I ' m sorry
You stupid bastards!
Go away!
You bastard!
What ' s happening?
Ahem, it's your fault
Don 't be rude
Apologize now
I ' m sorry
Japan Karate Association
The bed-wetter of Ikebukuro!
That's what people call you
these days
Is that why you begged
for your life? To live like that?
You are shameless!
What made Miyamoto Musashi
different from other warriors
as that he dreamed of being
the best fighter in the world
The best, the strongest man
in the world!
That is what you should dream of
to be as strong as your name
Baedal, 'the Korean people'
If you practice for
a thousand days
you' re still a beginner
But if you practice for
ten thousand days
you can become a master
This is kyokushin
or ' pure truth '
The spirit of kyokushin means to do
your best, until the last moment
Today, I ' m still walking
aimlessly
Help our lady!
Please help!
Stop it!
Let's go!
We shouldn 't have seen it
- What the fuck up bitch
- Help, please help the lady!
Officer! help!
Those bastards are worse
than the police or yakuzas!
Let's go, hurry!
Please, help!
Please!
Please, don ' t do this!
Somebody help!
The Japs don ' t protect
their own girls
Why are you getting involved?
Shit!

Setsu!
Setsu! Have you heard
of the brave tiger?
The brave tiger?
The mythical hero?
No, I mean, recently
Ah, the man who saves girls
from American soldiers?
That's just a story
That man who helped me
maybe he was the brave tiger?
Heck, no!
I ' m sure he was the brave tiger
If not, how come he would risk
his life to save me?
Then you think the guy who saved
you is a hero? The brave tiger?
A hero is protecting girls
in this neighborhood?
WANTED
Youko
Somebody to see you Go outside
What are you doing?

Follow me
Long time no see, brave tiger?
I don 't understand
Don 't you know what we did
to Korean women?
Why are you helping
Japanese women?
Is that why you called me here?
I have been practicing karate
since I was five
and I have never been beaten
by anyone in a fight
You ' re the first one to hit me
In that sense, I acknowledge
your fighting spirit
But that ' s all
Don 't ever talk of the brave tiger
or pretend to have
a noble samurai spirit!
Next time I see you
you ' ll be dead!
Have some fun here!
It ' s pachinko!
Get out of my lane
Pachinko!
Louder! Louder!
Go away!
Find the rationing tickets!
Find them! Check everywhere!
Pachinko, ah, I ' m hungry
Hey, why so glum?
Why are you so happy?
The yakuzas came here a while ago
so I was really worried
But they just passed by
They seemed to be going
somewhere else
Where?
Over there,
near the railway that way
Where?
Where are the ration tickets?
Here! Come this way!
Are the ration tickets
more important than your life?
Baedal, Baedal! Wake up!
Baedal, Baedal!
Justice without power is empty but
power without justice is only
violence
Be strong to protect yourself
and others
Baedal!
Youko
Justice without power is empty
but power without justice
is only violence
Be strong to protect yourself
and others
Baedal!
Take care
