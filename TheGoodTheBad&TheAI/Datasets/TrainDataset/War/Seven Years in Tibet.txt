Why must you be this way?
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?
- How long?
- Far too long.
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.
Let's try to make the best of this.
Where's thls idiot
who's supposed to meet us?
Move!
Mr. Harrer.
I have your tickets.
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!
Mr. Harrer?
May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer...
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.
Yes. but I'm sure that
as a distinguished member...
of the National Soclalist Party,
you would be proud to plant...
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.
Hans Lobenhoffer.
Lutz Chicken.
And a picture with your lovely wife.
And Mr.--
Horst lmmendorf. Family frlend.
No plcture necessary.
When is the little one due.
Mrs. Harrer?
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.
Thank you.
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?
I'm getting on that traln.
Do you have anything you want to say?
Fine.
Go. Leave.
I'll see you in four months.
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will. Heinrich .
We will travel 5,000 miles.
When we reach lndia,
we will head for the Hlmalayas...
and the ninth highest peak
on Earth, Nanga Parbat.
Germany calls it "Unserberg--
Our Mountain. "
Before us, four German expeditions
attempted it.
All failed.
Eleven climbers were killed
in storms and avalanches.
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat
is a national obsession--
a matter of German pride.
July 29, 1939.
We have already made Camp Four
at 22.000 feet.
Overhead is the Reklak Glacier
and a difficult climb up the icefall.
The baby must be
at least one month old now.
I have been
so confused and dlstracted.
I can 't climb
with my usual confldence.
Are you all right?
Shit!
- Are you al I right?
- Shall we come down?
Lost a crampon !
Go ahead!
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.
Rocks!
Look out below!
Hold me!
Have you got me?
Hold me!
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.
I should take a look at lt.
I could sew it up.
It's not your problem.
Actually, it is my problem.
- It's my life.
- What?
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...
I consider th at my problem.
No, you put your life at rlsk.
I saved it, so shut up !
Please, it is not your place--
Shut up !
The next time you lle
about an lnjury, Heinrich...
you're off the team.
Try it.
August 4th, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.
My teammates are nervous
about the avalanches...
so we 've been holed up for days.
Aufschnalter should take advantage of
this lowland weather to make high camp.
But he disagrees with me. Fool.
It seems the others don 't mind
sitting here waiting...
hoping, doing nothing.
So much time to question
one 's self is not good.
I am beginnlng to think
this whole expedition was a mistake.
Run ! Avalanche! Get out!
Leave everything!
Put that down !
We are going down now!
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.
I could summit on my own !
Always give the best man his shot!
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...
and my final attack tomorrow!
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!
- I want th at peak!
- As a team! That's an order!
That is an order! An order!
Follow me!
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.
Take it. Si Hib.
It will protect you.
No, that means nothing to me.
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.
Si Hib, take it.
Good protection for you.
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.
It might save you some prison time.
What is this? Who are you?
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?
I'm afraid not.
You see, war has been declared between
Hls Majesty's Government and Germany.
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian ! I'm a cllmber!
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!
Pigs! All of you, pigs!
October 15, 1939.
Reaching prison camp,
I make a promise to myself.
I will be lying beside lngrid before
the summer solstice of the new year.
The Hlmalayas are right in front of us.
It will be easy to escape
and get lost in them.
My fourth escape attempt
brings me no closer to my goal.
How far did you get this time?
All I have achieved is a certaln
dubious celebrity among the prisoners.
If only my hand could express
what is ln my heart.
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.
Yes.
Would you mail these?
Thank you.
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?
It was checked out to you.
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?
About this.
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?
After monsoon season. And you?
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.
Stop this embarrassing charade.
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.
The mailman has come.
Dear Heinrlch:
Please sign the enclosed dlvorce papers
and send them to my lawyer.
Horst and I intend to be married
as soon as the divorce is flnalized.
As for your letter, yes.
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born
while you were climbing the mountain.
He is now two years old
and calls Horst "papa. "
When he is old enough,
I will tell him...
his real father was lost
in the Himalayas.
It seems the kindest thing
to say consldering...
you never wanted the child anyway.
Needless to say,
I have no intention...
of "resolving our differences "
as you suggested.
They were resolved
the moment you left Austria.
I'm sorry you have been
imprisoned ln lndia...
and hope this dreadful war will soon
be over for everyone's sake.
Ingrid.
I'm coming with you.
This is your plan?
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.
Open the charts. Turn around.
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.
We are clear. Okay.
Open the gates!
See to this. Open the gates!
I'm going off on my own.
So, good luck.
First escape from prlson camp,
November 18, 1939.
Rolf Harrer--
three and a half months old.
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.
Rolf Harrer-- exactly one year,
Last escape from Dehra Dun.
Rolf Harrer--
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.
What are you doing here?
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.
What about the others?
The ltalians were caught
outside Nelang.
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?
Be my guest.
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?
A ten-piece orchestra?
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...
you may have dlfficulty
catchlng up with them.
I don 't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.
- But I don't.
- Don't what?
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?
No particular reason.
When you get there, tell my wife...
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.
And I'm glad to be free of them both.
I'm not golng back either,
not until this shameful war is over.
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.
Then on to China.
see if I can find some work there.
And you ?
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.
Tibet is 68.
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.
No, just full of food.
- Precisely.
- Mine.
That's too bad.
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...
I think I'm safer without you.
Of course.
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculatlon.
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?
All you've got is some stale crackers.
But I'm right. I'll win.
Tibet, the roof of the world.
It feels as though we have
ascended a medieval stone fortress...
towering above the center of Asla.
This ls the highest country on Earth.
And the most isolated.
There it is.
Tibet.
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.
Yes.
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?
Tibet.
- No foreigners allowed in Tlbet.
- Oh, please!
No foreigner!
Oh, please!
Yes. Thank you. Of course.
No translation needed.
Some people are glad to see us.
Don't let it get to your head.
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.
We need to find food.
It is the prophecy. It says here...
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...
will be attacked by outside forces.
Unless we can guard our own country...
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.
The Dalai Lama an d all
the revered holders of the faith...
will disappear and become nameless."
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to forelgners here?
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our--
His Excellency, the Garpon.
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.
We wanted to apologize.
Apologize.
And give you this really special gift.
Please, from us.
Long live the Dalai Lama,
Hi s Holiness.
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to lndla!
Two days into Tibet 's western frontier
and we are graciously klcked out.
Our guides have strict orders
to escort us...
to the lndian border
some 40 kllometers away...
and to shoot us
if we attempt escape.
Must mean hello.
As long as they don't try to kiss me.
We have to stock up. I'm broke.
Don't look at me.
We have to eat. Peter.
Know what time it is?
It is not negotiable.
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount BI anc.
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.
Communlsm soldier come from Chin a.
Very nice.
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.
You like military uniforms, yes?
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?
Wait.
Give me these, for the guards.
Look!
Like this. You like?
Very good. They're tough.
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?
You must make this face.
Come! Yes.
Stop!
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.
Stand like this.
Guess what?
All clear.
Know what time it is?
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...
I should foot the bill?
You are such a blg man
you don't need to contribute?
You have a problem?
Remind me...
what you said at the bazaar back there.
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."
You do not have one.
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!
This is junk
from some ltalian prisoners.
I don't give a shit!
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?
What principle?
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you !
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating !
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?
Try apologizing.
Try feeling a little remorse.
And if all else fail s,
try wiping that smirk off your face!
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.
No wonder you are always alone.
No one can stand
your miserable company.
Please, take them.
It was wrong of me to hide them.
- Keep this.
- No.
I didn't deserve It either.
Go ahead.
He'll be three and a half years old now.
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.
Which is fine.
Why?
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.
Write him a letter.
Let him know you're still alive.
New York.
Venice.
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?
It ls time for your lesson.
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.
Dear Rolf Harrer:
I'm a person you don 't know...
a man you 've never met.
But you are someone
who occupies my mind...
and my heart...
in this dlstant land
where I have gone.
If you can imagine a hidden place
tucked safely away from the world...
concealed by walls
of high, snowcapped mountains--
a place rich with all the strange
beauty of your nighttime dreams--
then you know where I am.
In the country
where I am traveling, Tibet...
people believe if they walk
long distances to holy places...
It purifles the bad deeds
they've committed.
They believe
the more difficult the journey...
the greater the depth
of purification.
I've been walking from one faraway
place to the next for many years--
as long as you have lived.
I have seen seasons change
across the high plateaus.
I have seen wild kiangs
migrate south in winter...
and sweep back across the fields
when spring appears.
In this place,
where time stands still...
it seems that everything is moving...
including me.
I can 't say I know where I'm going...
nor whether my bad deeds
can be purified.
There are so many things
I have done which I regret.
But when I come to a full stop,
I hope you will understand...
that the distance between us
is not as great as it seems.
Wlth deep affection...
your father, Heinrlch Harrer.
Get up.
My God!
I'll give you these.
Yellow head!
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!
We have no money!
Give me watch !
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you !
Wait!
Where are you headed?
I have permit.
Lhasa. I have permit.
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.
Only a month ago, we were certain
of death at the hands of bandits.
And today, we have reached the gates
of the forbidden city of Lhasa.
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...
and preclsely as attractive
because it ls closed to all foreigners.
Even in our miserable condition...
we feel the lure
of Tlbet 's holiest city...
home of the Dalai Lama.
Only a few foreigners
had penetrated its mysteries.
Oh, my God!
- Is It over?
- No. it is not over.
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.
We'd like that very much.
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.
I am Peter.
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...
an audlence with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.
With respect, Rinpoche...
If your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...
is not the most effective tactic.
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.
Of course. Forgive me.
You may leave now.
Start translating the letter
as written .
Of course.
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?
We should respect them.
If we return them to lndla,
they'll surely go back to prison.
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.
Invited them to stay at your place?
But why?
Must one have reason
to help those in need?
Beast.
I think she said you stink.
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.
I know who you are.
I am Pema Lhaki.
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.
Who is he to be so thoughtful?
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.
You're a seamstress?
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.
So, I pick?
Yes, choose whichever you like.
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.
- Very good.
- Did you make this?
- Yes.
- Beautiful.
- Th ank you.
- Do you like this?
Whichever you like.
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.
- Good choice.
- Thanks.
And you, sir?
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.
Please, sir, take off your chu-pa.
I would like to measure.
Stand still, please.
Thls way, please.
- Stand still.
- Sorry.
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.
Still, walking up mountain s
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.
Not so foolish, really.
Look at this.
Go ahead.
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.
You admire the man...
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.
Gentlemen.
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.
I am Ngawang Jigme.
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.
Thank you for your generous gift.
It's wonderful. Thank you.
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.
Perhaps you could help us explain...
why the min isters...
demand that the Chinese government...
"...cease making generous
financlal contributions...
to Tibetan monasteries."
Do our gifts displease your government?
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.
I am only a mere secretary.
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.
A man of such obvious talent
cannot be satisfied...
with just translating letters.
Your diplomatic skill...
would be richly rewarded here.
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.
I ask permission to take my leave.
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.
Yes, there's a--
Please, take a seat.
