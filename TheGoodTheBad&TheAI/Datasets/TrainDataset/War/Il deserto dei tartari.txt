Monday, august 2, 1907.
It's six o'clock in the morning.
Today, my youngest son is going
to leave our home.
he enters His Majesty'a Army.
I hoped his first assignment
would have been in town...
... or in a near village.
Instead, he leaves for
a loneIy fort...
... on the most distant border
of the empire...
Come on, wake up... it's six.
I'd like to be as happy as you...
... it's not your fault.
But I don't want to leave
with this memory of you.
I know what it all
means to you.
It's sad forthose who
are left behind.
Go now!
You're lucky...
You'll be hearing the famous
trumpets of Fort Bastiano every day!
I don't even know what the fort
looks like, but it's very distant.
You'll be the one who is going
to live the most exciting adventure.
Do you see that grove there?
... when I'm gone beyond them,
you won't see me anymore.
Hey there... Hey!
Sir!
What is it?
Nothing, Sir... nothing... I just
wanted to salute you, that's all.
Who are you?
Lieutenant Drogo, Sir.
Go on! Go on... Our paths
will meet farther down.
- Captain Hortiz.
- Lieutenant Drogo.
I suppose on the way to Bastiano?
I'd given up hope of ever
finding the fort.
Why?
I must have taken
the wrong way, Sir, and...
If you're coming from that
direction, you certainly did.
Those mountains are the border
with the North Kingdom.
No Army could cross them from
either side.
There's never been a fort of
any kind around here. No need for it.
Bastiano is farther on...
to the north.
A messenger? And you don't know
the roads? Amazing!
I'm not, Sir. I'm reporting there
for duty. My first assignment.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. You
couldn't have made a better choice.
- Two years, I suppose.
- Sir?
That's the rule. Two years on the
border count double for seniority.
I didn't know that, Sir.
But I didn't choose Bastiano.
- No?
- I was ordered there.
Odd! Usually...
- Give me a drink, Strauss.
- Sir...
What's odd, Captain?
There aren't many volunteers
for Bastiano these days...
That must explain
your orders.
- WouId you like a drink?
- Yes, please.
- Strauss!
- Thank you, Captain.
Bastiano is a dead border
station...
- ... as you will see.
- Thanks...
Only a pebble, Sir.
A splinter in the hoof.
What did the Captain mean by a
''dead border station''?
A border with nothing on the
other side of it. AbsoluteIy nothing.
Beyond the fort there is
a desert, Lieutenant Drogo...
And then... nothing.
- The Desert of the Tartars.
- The Tartars?
They may even have crossed the
desert once, a long time ago.
But they vanished, after
destroying the ancient city.
The desert has kept
their name.
The older a nation's history is,
the more legends spring up.
In the end, we don't know what's
true and what isn't.
I've been at Bastiano
for eighteen years.
I admit the place looks much more
beautiful inside than from out there.
I see you are in a hurry
to report.
Ride ahead.
Go... go ahead, Lieutenant.
Halt!
Advance and be recognized!
Lieutenant Drogo.
Assigned to Fort Bastiano.
I've come to take up my post.
Simeon.
Drogo, Sir.
Welcome to Bastiano.
Thank you.
Lazare!
First Sergent Tronk.
Take the Lieutenant's horse.
Come, I'll take you to meet
Major Matti.
- Take over, Tronk.
- But, that was a general aIarm!
What of it?
In case of alarm, the commissioned
officer on duty takes command.
That's regulation, Sir.
Paragraph 3 of the regulations,
Tronk. But paragraph 12 says:
''Guard posts not immediately
exposed to attack, which is this case...
may be placed underthe command of
a high-ranking non-commissioned officer''.
Any objections?
None, Sir.
Fine. Come with me,
Lieutenant Drogo.
It's not your fault, but you've
arrived at the worst possible moment.
I'm sorry, Sir.
Colonel, this is
Lieutenant Drogo.
I'm delighted to welcome you
to Bastiano.
The King himself has called us
''the noblest guardian of His Crown''.
Our garrison is an enviable assignment
for an ambitious young officer.
You'll soon see for yourself.
I'm listening, Lieutenant...
All positions ready to open fire on
the enemy 6 minutes after the aIarm.
Six minutes, you say?
Five minutes and 42 seconds.
A pity you're leaving us, Lieutenant...
As a soldier... I'll miss you.
If I may say so... I'll miss you too,
Sir... as a soldier.
You may go, Lieutenant.
Good riddance! A fine efficer, but...
aII the same, good riddance!
WouId you Iike to be introduced to
His ExceIIency right now, or at mess?
This evening at mess, Sir.
It wiII be an honor.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
My name's Rovine. I'm the doctor here.
Your medicaI fiIe arrived here
before you did. WeIcome to Bastiano.
Thanks, Sir.
Excuse me, CoIoneI. This is
Lieutenant Drogo.
- Sir...
- No, thank you.
Don't insist, I toId you.
Make up your mind. I can easiIy
wait anotherthree days.
I'm steaIing him from you.
Come, Drogo.
What's wrong with the
Lieutenant CoIoneI?
A gIorious battIe wound... when
there were stiII wars...
Broken back... SteeI corset...
He's the onIy one who's actuaIIy
been under fire.
I onIy suggested you'd be better
off stationed in town.
You've just come from the city...
... heIp me convince him!
- Keep out of this, Lieutenant.
- Be carefuI, pIease.
Getting invoIved in Rathenau's and
AmerIing's bickering can be dangerous!
Sirs! His ExceIIency!
WeIcome back, Hortiz. I hope
the traveI was fine.
Thanks, Sir.
Dear Nathanson, GeneraI Conrad
greets you.
He wouId Iike to have you for
the Army manoeuvres in the south.
WouId you... pIease...
Go on...
PIease, Sirs...
Lieutenant Drogo, Sir.
He has arrived this morning.
The Adjudant has my papers.
I request the honor of
introducing myseIf to you.
Jean Baptiste Drogo,
Infantry Lieutenant,
at your orders.
Good evening, your ExceIIency.
Good evening, gentIemen.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
His ExceIency, CoIoneI,
Count of FiIimore...
... commander in chief of the
garrison, invites you to join us.
CoIoneI Nathanson.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am in command of your company.
Captain Hortiz.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am in command of the garrison cannon.
Captain Von Sern.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am the garrison physician.
Major doctor Rovine.
I am Simeon, senior subordinate
officer of the garrison.
Lieutenant Simeon.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I'm AmerIing.
Lieutenant Von AmerIing...
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant Von Rathenau.
I'm Maude. Good evening,
Lieutenant Drogo.
Lieutenant Maude...
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
My name's Von Arnim.
Lieutenant Von Arnim.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I'm Sarteris.
Lieutenant Sarteris.
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant Gothard...
Second Lieutenant MoreI.
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
Second Lieutenant MoreI.
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
WiII you dine with us?
Thank you, ExceIIency. Thanks, Sirs.
I am honored.
You can't reaIIy see the desert untiI
you're at the advance post overthere.
What can you see from there?
Stones... sand... dust...
And aImost aIways, mist.
But further, to the north...
You must be abIe to see something?
Nothing but mist, winter
and summer.
StiII... there are some who insist...
... that they've seen riders
on white horses.
PatroIs from the North Kingdom?
Not necessariIy.
Where eIse wouId they come from?
From the desert.
If it were true, the GeneraI Staff
wouId know abouti it... peopIe wouId know.
There are things they prefer not
to taIk about, officiaIIy.
CoIoneI FiIimore
never mentions them.
- As for Hortiz...
- Captain Hortiz?
It was shortIy after
he got to Bastiano.
He was in charge of the outpost.
He saw them...
... just at the edge of the mist...
Hortiz saw the riders?
He even gave the aIarm...
He had a cannon shot fired.
A serious decision.
An officer Iike Hortiz
wouId never have done it.
... without being sure.
When dawn came, the riders
had disappeared.
So he was the onIy one
who saw them.
This morning he toId me Bastiano
was a dead border station...
... overIooking nothing.
He spoke of Iegends...
But aII the same he's stayed
on here, waiting...
Waiting for what?
The enemy. From the North Kingdom
or from the desert...
Hortiz may not beIieve
so strongIy, now...
... but he's waiting,
Iike the others...
CaIm down, CoIoneI... try to stay
caIm for a moment...
I'II heIp you, don't worry!
How can I make you an injection?
CaIm!
Give me a hand!
HoId him! Hurry!
Keep him stiII!
What is he saying?
He wants you to put your
hand ovre his mouth.
Keep him stiII!
You can Iet him go, Lieutenant.
The drug acts aImost
immediateIy.
- Ijust can't beIieve it, you know...
- What?
That I'II be back in town...
in two days...
... and I won't see this
fort anymore... but you...
You'II be seeing my famiIy?
There's stiII time. I'II wait
for you... Why don't you?
No...
I toId you, I Iike Bastiano,
and I feeI fine.
Anyway, that's what you're
to teII my mother.
Promise me.
What eIse can I teII her, the truth?
That everyday, you are cIosest
to the suicide, here at Bastiano?
You mustn't be Iate.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Very weII! You've been frank with
me, and I'II be frank with you.
Twice a year, we aII have a
medicaI examination.
Me... Lieutenant CoIoneI Nathanson...
the CoIoneI himseIf.
Everybody. It's reguIation.
When yourturn comes, I promise to
get you a negative report.
You can count on me.
Is that cIear, Lieutenant?
Yes, Sir. I don't know
how to thank you.
The next examination wiII be
in four months' time.
Four months?
That's the best I can do, Lieutenant.
What if I wouId send in an appIication?
There's your careerto think of.
AppIying for a transfer at your
first assignment couId harm you.
According to my suggestion, you'II
have time to show what you can do.
Four months... that's not so bad!
I beIieve you're right, Sir...
I'm going to take your advice.
Good! Keep it a secret!
Just between you and me.
Good morning, Sir.
Lieutenant Drogo...
Your pIatoon moved in ahead of
Lieutenant Sartoris' at roII caII.
He's your senior, here.
Lieutenant Sarteris' pIatoon
was Iate, Sir...
Stay in your pIace!
Your men are weII discipIined,
Lieutenant, congratuIations.
So I'm aII the more sorry you
made the decision to Ieave us.
Don't be surprised...
Everybody knows about your
agreement with Major Matti.
You know, many young officers
have come to Bastiano just Iike you.
And those who have chosen to
stay, don't feeI inferior.
I neverthought anything
Iike that, Sir.
I wanted a different assignment.
It was mere chance that I was
sent here.
And if the chance wants
you to stay?
Maybe that's what happened to me.
It's more probabIe that chance
had nothing to do with any of it.
CIose ranks, Lazare!
Get a move on!
- Come on, you stupid muIe!
- Lazare! Move on!
- March!
- Come on, move!
Coming off Guard... Be carefuI!
Present arms!
PIatoon, haIt!
Ground arms!
Coming off guard, ground arms!
Stand at ease!
- Is this your first duty out here?
- Yes.
Rather boring, but you get used
to it. You'II see.
Night faIIs earIy, this time
of year...
Sooner or Iater, in this darkness,
something's going to happen.
The CoIoneI shouId be warned
of the danger.
What danger?
You see Lieutenant AmerIing's
unit?
It'II be dark when they get back
to the fort.
Lieutenant AmerIing, Iike you,
Sir, has three different passwords.
The one who was vaIid when he
Ieft, the one he used here...
... and the one he wiII need
to reenterthe fort.
Because, meanwhiIe, the guards
wouId have come off duty.
- What of it?
- WeII...
Suppose that the onIy officer who
knows the password faIIs sick...
In that case, the guard coming off
duty wouIdn't be Iet into the fort.
Beacuse onIy that officer must
give the password.
- The sentries wouId recognize them.
- In the dark?
And what if the returning guard
was attacked by surprise...
... and wiped out by an enemy
patroI between here and the fort?
The enemy soIdiers couId
put on our uniforms.
True.
Without the password, Sir,
nobody coming from the North VaIIey,
... and I mean nobody, can
enterthe front.
Tronk!
- Tronk!
- At your orders, Sir.
Tronk... I may be mistaken...
But it seems to me... out there...
- Look! Look!
- What is it?
Something out there, straight!
Everybody back to your posts!
CIam down the horses!
It's coming this way!
No, it's moving, not toward us.
Back to your posts, not a sound!
- DoubIe the guard, CorporaI.
- Yes, Sir.
- You! Up to the pIatform!
- Yes, Sir!
- Ready at the cannons!
- Yes, Sir.
- Everybody on position!
- It vanished, now.
- I can't see nothing, now.
- Machinegun ready to fire!
They can teII...
What do you mean?
The horses, they can feeI
them coming.
Them who? Shut up!
From where?
And who...
There's onIy desert...
miIes of desert...
Tronk...
WouId you give the aIarm?
Fire the cannon is an
heavy decision.
In a coupIe of minutes, the
fort wiII be on war.
I'd wait tiII dawn, Sir.
What do you think of that, Tronk?
Nothing yet, Sir.
Ask the corporaI to come here.
Then get back to your cannon.
Yes, Sir.
AII right.
Now teII me what you think.
That horse isn't from Bastiano,
Sir.
Maybe you haven't noticed. At
Bastiano aII the horses are bIack or bay.
Where wouId it come from?
ReIieve the night guard,
CorporaI.
Put three gunners at the cannon,
ready to fire.
Tronk...
WouId you advise me to give
the aIarm, now?
No Sir, not yet...
But we shouId be prepared to,
any moment.
That horse. What is the danger
of a Ione horse?
Might mean danger is on the way.
From the North Kingdom?
Their horsemen have never
ventured into the desert...
At Ieast, not untiI now...
Then speak out, Tronk! I want
to hear you say the word!
Tartars, Sir...
It's a Tartar horse.
Nothing's going to happen.
No one's coming.
We spent our whoIe day
staring at that horse.
Lazare, on your post!
I know how you feeI, Sir...
But the border is just
beIow us...
- ReguIations are reguIations.
- What of it?
Bet that horse out there never
heard of your reguIations!
AII right, Tronk...
I won't send anyone to bring
the horse in...
... since it's against reguIations.
Our reIief wiII be here
in an hour.
And it wiII soon be dark...
- Who goes there?
- Guard returning from the out post.
- Give the password!
- Sword and banner.
Open the door!
Guards, haIt! Stay at ease.
- CaII the roII Tronk, and dismiss.
- Yes, Sir.
- CorporaI, caII the roII.
- Yes, Sir.
- Merru...
- Present.
- Sveta...
- Present.
- Vinovich...
- Present.
- FiIey...
- Present.
- Fritz...
- Present.
- Haus...
- Present.
Lazare...
- Lazare!
- Present.
That horse shouId have been
captured.
But, reguIations, Sir?
An officer must take
responsibiIity, sometimes.
You may go now, Major.
Stay, Lieutenant.
You behaved wiseIy, Lieutenant.
First, not by aIerting the fort.
Am I right, ExceIIency?
It was just a horse without
an horseman.
SecondIy, you foIIowed reguIations
to the Ietter.
I congratuIate you, Lieutenant.
A border is a border...
OnIy His ExceIIency couId have taken
the initiative to capture the horse.
Do you think that horse beIonged
to a miIitary unit?
- Answer me, Captain.
- No, I don't think so.
StiII, you admit the incident is
suspect from an army standpoint.
Yes, Sir.
Then why haven't you
doubIed the guard?
Those are the times when the
reguIations shouId be appIied strictIy.
Come, Lieutenant.
- A white horse, you say?
- Yes, ExceIIency.
CoIoneI, pIease.
I'm honored, CoIoneI.
- No speciaI marks?
- No, Sir. Nothing.
No saddIe.
- It must have gone away by now.
- No doubt, your ExceIIency.
Do you think I shouId have
trespass the borderto catch it?
ReguIation is reguIation,
Lieutenant.
It's certainIy His ExceIIency's
opinion.
You may go now, Major!
You must not bIame yourseIf
Lieutenant.
The Major is unfortunateIy
right. We can do nothing about it.
- Who goes there?
- Private Lazare, muIe driver.
Listen, friend. I've broken
reguIations, try to keep it quiet.
I've got a horse, here.
Advance and give the password!
The password?
How shouId I know it?
Didn't you hear about the horse?
Look, I'm bringing it in.
Are you going to open up or not?
- The password!
- I toId you... I don't know it!
My name's Lazare. You must
recognize me. I can't make out your face.
What are you doing? You're not
going to shoot!
No! Don't shoot! No!
- AIert!
- AIert!
- AIert!
- Everybody on his posts!
- Open the door.
- You can't get out, Sir.
Get off!
Lazare!
Right in the middIe of
the forehead. Who fired?
Private Kupka, Sir.
First rate shot.
I trained him myseIf.
- And what's this one's name?
- Private Lazare, Sir.
A diserter...
As weekIy duty officer, it's my
job to find out how the tragedy occurred.
Tragedy? Stop being dramatic,
Captain!
Lazare tried to bring the horse
back to the fort.
The sentry can testify.
He'II testify! He'II prove this
soIdier was a traitor!
You aIso have a few things
to expIain, Lieutenant.
This soIdier was one of
your guard, wasn't he?
Yes, Sir.
His disobedience couId be the
cause of a serious incident.
The North Kingdom might protest
for border vioIation!
You can't be serious.
DeaI with this, Tronk.
Have him buried...
Without honors!
Yes, Sir.
Sir!
- Order... arms.
- Yes, Sir.
Order... arms!
Order... arms!
Order... arms!
Order... arms!
Order... arms!
What's going on?
Tronk, what's going on!
The third pIatoon refuses to obey
orders, Sir...
It's private Lazare's section.
Refused to present arms
before the fIag.
Refusing to obey...
These men beIong to your
company, Captain...
And to your section, Lieutenant!
I demand a report,
immediateIy!
Order... arms!
You bastards...
Let them stand there. Without
food and water...
... As Iong as they refuse to obey!
At ease!
My report, your ExceIIency.
What do you want from them,
Major?
First, their submission.
Then, I want them severeIy punished.
The dead soIdier was one
of them, wasn't he?
That's no excuse, ExceIIency.
Those men refused to present arms
before their officers and the fIag!
And they didn't obey,
insuIting me.
Order... arms!
Present'arm!
Excort these men to their
ceIIs, Sergeant.
Four days of bread and water.
You have heart condition, this
aItitude is bad for your system.
WiII that do?
Perfect. Thank you.
Bastiano is probabIy bad
for everyone.
I'm not sure God himseIf
couId survive here.
You're thinking of
AmerIing's iIIness?
Yes... he's not the onIy one.
Some nasty germs have been
trapped in these waIIs for centuries...
There's no cure.
And it's impossibIe
to diagnose.
Even the speciaIists in the
capitaI are at a Ioss.
- You're wise to Ieave.
- That's not the reason...
I was sent here by mistake.
Here, eIsewhere... we're aII
somewhere by mistake.
You're wise.
If I couId, I myseIf...
CouIdn't you ask for
a transfer?
I couId, of course... but
I'd feeI Iike a deserter...
With that certificate, you can
Ieave whenever you Iike.
AII you need is the
GeneraI's signature...
You're Iucky, he'II be
here in two weeks.
Quickerthan sending it to town
and waiting for an answer.
Thank you.
- Goodbye, Lieutenant.
- Goodbye.
Touched!
You're first rate, AmerIing, but
I'm not as young as you are.
You're not even
out of breathe.
You think I can't Iast
to the end?
I reaIIy wouId Iike to stop,
but if you want to continue...
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you.
Garrison!
On your knees!
Lord, I'm afraid, and I pIace my
trust in Thee, Father...
O Lord, grant us peace!
Turn not Thy face away.
BIess my souI and wash away
my sins.
Jesus, have mercy upon us.
Saturday night, as the first day
of the week was dawning...
Mary MagdaIene and
the other Maria, after bought some essences...
... came to see Jesus' sepuIchre
to embaIm him.
And then an angeI came, it
descended from up above...
It knocked overthe stone,
and sat on it.
It seemed Iike a thunder,
and with a dress so shining...
The guards, frightened, faIIen
on the ground as they were dead.
The AngeI smiIed to the
women and said:
''Don't be afraid, the man you
are Iooking for, isn't here.''
He rose again from the death,
on the third day, as he had foretoId...
... and has gone to GaIiIea.
Go, and meet him there.
They have swords, and shieIds.
Who, Sir?
The horsemen in the desert.
The men I saw once, a Iong
time ago.
They ride white horses.
They don't want anyone to see
their swords gIeaming in the sun.
They Iet them tarnish.
An oId warriors' trick.
Is that what you
wanted to know?
Why I stayed here?
To wait forthem.
- Captain Hortiz.
- Good evening, Captain.
Your ExceIIency...
Our dear Nathanson...
- I'm happy to see you, how is it?
- Good, ExceIIency, better.
- Lieutenants Von AmerIing...
- Sir.
- ... Von Arnim...
- ExceIIency...
- ... Maude.
- Sir.
Lieutenant Gothard,
- Honored.
GIad to see you, ExceIIency.
- Lieutenant Sarteris.
- Your ExceIIency.
Your mother is my wife' s friend.
They meet often.
She aIways asks me about
you, I'II teII herthat we have met.
Thank you very much, Sir.
- Lieutenant MoreI.
- Good evening.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
- Major Mattis.
- Nice to see you.
Honored.
- Captain Von Sern...
- Captain...
- Lieutenant Simeon.
- Ah, Simeon...
I know your father, we were
together in the academy.
ExceIIency, I know...
- This is Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant...
... you're new at Bastiano,
aren't you...
I've been here four months, Sir.
Lieutenant Drogo is one of the
garrison's best officer.
I'm not surprised, Bastiano
attracts aII of our best young men.
- I'm happy to see you here.
- Dinner is served.
This way, ExceIIency.
Let's have dinner! The ceremony
has given me appetite.
I envy you: the finest parades,
the finest officers...
... the finest cook. What's
Bastiano's weak spot?
- Is something going wrong?
- No doctor, nothing.
ShaII I have the GeneraI sign
your certificate for you?
No, Sir. Thank you.
WeII, then come and sit.
Don't just stand there.
There he is!
In there!
- Missed him that time.
- You missed it, not me.
Don't provoke me with
this kind of games.
Neither with others.
You wouId Iose in any case.
Yes, untiI it's a game.
Look! Overthere...
- How many did you say?
- One company, I shouId say.
That soIdier... who brought the
horse back to Bastiano...
... you remember, Drogo?
Yes Sir, I remember.
It's too bad we never found where
that horse was from... Come in, pIease.
Your ExceIIency...
The enemy wiII be in sight of
Bastiano in a few minutes.
- Did you say ''the enemy'', Major?
- Yes, your ExceIIency.
They are advancing armed,
according to the ruIes of war.
They hope to take us by surprise,
after skirting the desert...
Thank you, Major.
Your ExceIIency, aren't you going
to order a generaI aIarm?
As aIways, I appreciate your
sense of duty, Major.
Inform the officers to report
to me here, as usuaI, in 10 minutes.
- But, Your ExceIIency...
- You may go now, Major.
Stay Lieutenant, pIease...
Stay, pIease.
What's the meaning of aII this
confusion? Go back to your pIaces!
You've no business here!
CIearthe parapet! Move!
CoIoneI, here are the
officiaIs.
Sit down, pIease, CoIoneI
Nathanson.
Sit down, gentIemen.
Did you want to say something,
Major?
There are more on the way, Your
ExceIIency, more aII the time.
They're spreading out aIong the
border. You can see them from the window.
I don't think so.
Stay where you are, Major.
I'II ask you to Iook out, if
I feeI it necessary.
I'm sorry to have to say this:
I have noticed more than once...
... that, during the changing
of the guard, some units arrive...
... without their commanding
officers...
Your ExceIIency, we're
wasting vaIuabIe time!
Lieutenant MaIevic, ExceIIency.
I bring a message from the Chief
of the GeneraI Staff.
Excuse me, gentIemen.
Thank you, Lieutenant. You
must be exhausted.
Lieutenant Von Arnim
wiII Iook after you.
GentIemen...
This morning, our soIdiers
and you too...
... were troubIed...
... by the presence of foreign
troops in the North VaIIey.
The troops are from
the North Kingdom,
sent here simpIy to survey
the border Iine,
as we did ourseIves a
few years ago.
Good...
The units in question wiII not
come to Bastiano.
They won't.
They'II break up in smaII groups,
to carry on the mission in the mountains.
That is the message sent from
the Chief of the GeneraI Staff.
He aIso asks me to organize an
expedition without deIay...
... to estabIish the border Iine on
our side in one mountain area...
... where it hasn't yet been
surveyed.
I need hardIy add that it wouId
be best we reached first...
to take possession without
incident.
ExceIIency, I'm the onIy
Engineer co-officer, here.
WiII you authorize me to
command the expedition?
Yes, of course. Pick the men
you need and Ieave at dawn.
Have them take warm cIothing.
You can Ieave.
You're going to have a hard time
waIking in those things.
I don't want any deIays.
And they're going to hurt.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, Sir.
- We'II camp here.
- PIatoon, haIt!
Have the first unit set up
theirtents here?
The men who wiII go on top
can rest.
Yes, Sir.
Sergeant, set up the tents,
and discharge the muIes...
Hey, you...
... Iight the fire, and
distribute the meaIs.
I see you're in exceIIent form.
Thank you, Sir.
A pity we don't come up here
more often. Magnificent view!
In that case, you can come with
me on the cIimb.
That's what you want,
isn't it?
I wasn't expecting such an honor.
Don't ever Ioose the contact
with the person that's towards you.
If you get Iost, fire 3 shots.
We'II stop and fire. So you
can reach us.
Don't put off your gIoves!
You, cover up your head!
PIatoon!
Twenty soIdiers,
two non commissioned officer.
- WeII, Lieutenant.
- Goodbye, Captain.
Goodbye, Drogo.
Goodbye.
- With God's heIp... Iet's go.
- PIatoon, ready!
Go, ahead!
I wish I couId go with you, Drogo.
To AmerIing's famiIy, teII his mother...
You'II know what to say, I'm sure.
WiII you be coming back, Drogo?
I don't know, Sir.
I'II go see the GeneraI.
See you...
You're asking me to Ieave
Bastiano? This is impossibIe!
I'm not asking you, Major.
I have made my decision.
It's not reguIation... onIy
the GeneraI...
The GeneraI promised me that
he'd give you a spIendid assignment,
... where your remarkabIe abiIity
to command, wiII be appreciated.
Your sudden interest in me
is surprising, Your ExceIIency.
No surprise! I've aIways
appreciated your devotion to duty...
But I don't beIong to your worId!
That's the probIem, isn't it?
You've never considered me the
equaI of officers of your cIass.
You put up with me...
Let me handIe the jobs you didn't
want to touch yourseIf.
But you never had anything
but contempt for me!
Now, because of AmerIing, you
insist on my Ieaving.
You hoId me responsibIe
for his death!
You're the one who feeIs Iike
that, and you're aImost pIeased.
You're quite mistaken!
You had nothing to do with
the death of AmerIing.
AbsoIuteIy nothing!
It's something you can't
understand. Beyond anything you are...
... or ever can be!
Here is your promotion to the
rank of Lieutenant-CoIoneI.
My congratuIations.
Lieutenant, the GeneraI's
right arm?
Lieutenant, the GeneraI.
... Bastiano! Yes...
PIease, come in.
Ah... You at Bastiano gave us
pIenty of troubIes...
... overthe border matter.
His Highness accept no compromise
where a piece of empire is envoIved.
A mountain peak is a mountain
peak. What's his name?
Von AmerIing, Sir.
Count Peter Von AmerIing.
Hard headed deviI! His stubborness
Iost us a mountain peak.
Sir, AmerIing is the one
who died.
Ah, is that so?
PIease, stay down.
In any case, the whoIe business
made a bad impression. Enough of that!
You want a new assignment,
do you?
Bring me the fiIe of...
What's your name?
- Drogo.
- Drogo!
And preferabIy in town,
I suppose.
- Yes, Sir, if it can be arranged.
- WeII! Let's see...
Do you know Bastiano's
weak point, Lieutenant?
No, Sir, I've no idea.
There are too many men.
That's the weak point. Yes!
It's a overstaffed. That's why
it was decided to reduce its strenght.
- Reduce the strenght?
- You didn't know?
No, Sir.
I can't seem to find your
transfer appIication...
I didn't make an officiaI request.
But I think this paper wiII do...
It's a medicaI certificate, Sir.
MedicaI certificate...
I see, I see...
And I aIso see it was made out
a Iong time ago!
Not that I doubt its vaIidity,
but it's not recent enough.
And anotherthing...
If your heaIth was so poor...
... at the time the certificate...
... was signed, then why
didn't you Ieave the fort?
But, I was assured that...
The best wouId be you return
to Bastiano, Lieutenant...
... to settIe this probIem. That is,
if you are stiII in poor heaIth.
WouIdn't be easier for me to make
a normaI appIication fortransfer?
No, Lieutenant. That was
possibIe before, but not now.
We're reducing staff
at Bastiano,
... we give preference to officers
who have made reguIar appIications.
But when, Sir? I never heard
it mentioned.
How shouId I know?
You wouIdn't be asking me to
show favoritism?
No, Sir, certainIy not.
Goodbye.
Keep me informed.
I may seem severe, but I Iike
receiving young officers Iike you.
At your age, an occasionaI
taIking to doesn't do any harm...
Goodbye, Lieutenant.
- HeIIo, Lieutenant.
- Are you Ieaving, Tronk?
No, Sir. I'm staying.
Sir...
Drogo! You came back?
My private IittIe museum...
As time goes by, we accumuIate
things without reaIizing, untiI the day...
Come...
The GeneraI toId me they were
reducing the strenght of Bastiano.
I didn't reaIize to what extent...
orthat you'd be Ieaving too, Sir.
Neither did I.
It took everyone by surprise...
UsuaIIy things proceed...
... more sIowIy.
Do you know why the GeneraI
Staff has caIIed you back, Sir?
No, they probabIy think I've
been here Iong enough...
... that I'm too oId.
It's up to you to take my
pIace, my young friend!
WiII you do me the honor of
having a Iast drink together?
Of course, Sir. DeIighted.
I was afraid I wouIdn't have the
pIeasure of seeing you again, Drogo.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
But you wanted to go too,
didn't you?
There's been a mix up with
my fiIe.
- Is my command responsibIe?
- I'm the onIy one to bIame.
WouId you Iike me to put in a
word, to speed things up for you?
Thank you, Sir, but I don't mind
staying a whiIe Ionger at Bastiano.
- Hortiz wiII be happy to have you.
- Captain Hortiz is staying?
Major Hortiz. He's repIacing me
as commander at Bastiano.
It was my wish.
If you'II excuse me, I stiII
have a great deaI to do...
I won't be coming
to mess again.
Take care of yourseIf.
- Sir...
- Goodbye.
Have you come back?
What is it?
- You don't seem pIeased to see me.
- Ijust thought you'd never come back.
- Any news?
- Nothing, as usuaI.
- May I have it back? I must go.
-Just one moment.
- What are you Iooking at?
- Nothing particuIarIy.
- They're waiting for me..Simeon!
- There's a Iight, down there!
What are you taIking about?
Have you gone crazy?
There isn't just one Iight,
there are four or five!
That's absurd!
Look! I teII you!
A bit more to the right!
Can you see it now?
Don't teII me you don't see
anything! I wouIdn't beIieve you!
I discovered them 3 weeks ago...
I didn't wanted to teII you, yet!
Why not?
You might have Iaughed
at the idea.
That's why nobody must
be toId!
The Iights are there, everybody
can see them.
No, not without a speciaI
fieIdgIass Iike this.
AII the more reason to teII
Hortiz, at Ieast!
No...
They wouId canceI the departures.
Some of them wouId take
advantage of the opportunity.
What opportunity?
If something finaIIy does happen,
the fewer of us, the better!
What do you mean?
It's probabIy a nomads' camp.
No...
They wouId move. In three weeks'
time they wouId have vanished.
It's a construction site...
Thery're buiIding a road.
A road? In the desert?
What wouId be the use of it?
To reach Bastiano faster.
To bring up heavy weapons...
Cannons across the desert?
Simeon...
- Do you reaIIy beIieve that?
- Think what you Iike!
... But don't teII a souI!
Understand?
I beIieve it's best not to.
Leave me yourteIescope, wiII you?
Sir... Do us the honor of
presiding at ourtabIe.
This way, gentIemen.
Thank you.
I beg you pardon for
being Iate.
What are you Iooking at,
Lieutenant?
And what are you and Simeon
pIotting together aII the time?
A secret...
... that has became too heavy
for us.
We were pIanning to teII you,
of course,
... but we wanted to be certain.
Certain of what?
Look for yourseIf, Sir.
That way...
There, straight that way...
What was I supposed to see,
Lieutenant?
Sir, those IittIe Iights...
Way out there in the desert...
I don't know what you're
taIking about.
I didn't see a thing.
I assure you... not a thing.
AbsoIuteIy.
Listen...
I don't want that a voice,
based on an opticaI iIIusion...
... couId take pIace.
In the past, irresponsibiIity
Iike that, had damaged the fort.
But Sir... This time...
Is that cIear, Lieutenant?
Yes, Sir.
I have just received your
promotion to Captain.
CongratuIations, Drogo.
- Anything eIse, Sir?
- No, you may go.
They're advancing, but are they
stiII invisibIe to the naked eyes?
I can't understand it. Maybe
they've run into troubIes.
No, they don't want to aIarm
us by coming too fast.
They're pretending the road is
of no great importance.
Of course! That must
be it!
They hope we'II get used to it,
and in time, the road wiII seem normaI.
The proof: Hortiz's
attitude. He never mentions it.
- Who's on guard at the outpost?
- Sarteris, but he can't see anything.
I don't trust Sarteris,
I don't trust anybody.
- They're coming straight toward?
- AbsoIuteIy.
I've got two Iandmarks to
guide me. I can't be wrong.
Stay down.
Come on, stay down...
Ok? I'II go...
But it couId take years...
Years?
Yes...
Haven't you noticed how
Hortiz has aged?
CoIoneI Hortiz, commanding officer
of the fort, request that...
... aII officers and soIdiers...
... ignore the said threatened
invasion...
... of our borders.
Therefore, any man on duty...
... at the outpost,
must use...
... onIy reguIation
opticaI fieIdgIasses.
Go on, Captain.
... Anyone possessing opticaI
instruments which...
... do not conform, must
surrender such instruments...
... immediateIy.
Then, an officiaI wiII keep
them in a safe pIace.
Missed!
I can't understand why Hortiz
gave that order.
What does it matter, now?
Nobody reaIIy beIieves in
the road's existence...
Even I...
What did you mean, ''even I''?
Strike!
You didn't turn in
yourteIescope?
What eIse was I supposed to do?
It was an order!
Without that, we won't see
anymore!
You just won't see as far.
Come in.
- Have you sent for me, Sir?
- Yes. WouId you have tea with me?
Of course, Sir... with pIeasure.
I have made the decision
to abandon the outpost.
May I ask why, Sir?
I haven't enough men to
keep a guard out there aII the time.
But, it's the onIy pIace from
which we can have advance warning...
That wiII do, Drogo.
I've had enough.
Nothing you can say wiII
make any difference.
I have aIready signed
the order.
Excuse me, Sir.
Things have been happening...
things I can't understand.
You can't have transmitted
an order Iike this...
An inspection guard wiII be
sent there every ten days.
I pIace you in command of it.
Company!
Present'arm!
For CoIoneI Hortiz...
- Hip, hip, hip...
- Hurrah!
Do I have your permission
to enterthe mess haII?
PIease, Sir...
WouId you Iike anything?
May I serve you?
Just a coffee.
Where have you been assigned,
Sir?
I'm going nowhere, Drogo.
Things wiII be different
here now.
Perhaps I'd be wise
to Ieave.
Why?
You're second in command now,
in some years, you'II take Simeon's pIace.
And stiII nothing wiII happen!
- Do you reaIIy have to Ieave?
- I received orders, Drogo.
And obeying is the one thing
I've aIways known how to do weII.
I hope you'II command Bastiano,
the day the enemy attacks, and he wiII,
... even if I was ordered
to ignore it.
What absurdity, and what
despise...
I might have been
usefuI in wartimes...
So many years... such a
Iong wait...
... without knowing why...
I'm gIad you kept me company
this far.
Now you must go back.
Have we ever shaken hands?
Never, Sir.
Go away! Go!
Drink this, Sir. It's coId up
on this pIatform, at night.
Come on, take it.
I'II have your horse saddIed,
Sir... we're going back.
- Are you certain?
- AbsoIuteIy, Sir.
Sergeant Tronk saw
them too.
The cannon...
My God, the cannon...
This time... here we are...
what do I have to do?
I can't...
He had a cannon shot fired...
Tronk ordered them
to fire the cannon...
The Tartars! They're
coming!
Did you hearthat, Sir?
The enemy's marching on Bastiano.
- He's improved since tonight.
- Oh, yes...
- I feeI abIe to get up.
- I wouIdn't advise that.
You heard, the enemy is
advancing...
Yes, battaIions and battaIions!
And you want to keep me in bed?
It's not a decision by myseIf.
What? WouId you try to fight?
You ought to rest a day or
two Ionger.
Major Simeon wants you to
stay in your room.
Simeon?
He came to see you Iast night,
he didn't think you Iooked weII.
Let him mind his business!
Have they sent a messengerto town?
Sergeant Lobis Ieft afterthe
first cannon shot, Sir.
By now, the GeneraI Staff
has been informed.
Damn it!
WiII you Iet me know
what's happening?
I'm second in command
at Bastiano!
- CaIm down...
- Sir...
Stay caIm, come on!
Don' t be agitated, come on...
ReIax...
Go to heII, Rovine...
Leave me, Ieave me...
Sir, the cannons are
in sight.
Rovine!
I'm sorry.
It's not your fauIt if I feII
iII at this moment.
It probabIy is, Drogo.
Without any doubts.
You'II make it, I know...
- CaII here Kreysky.
- He's on guard duty, Sir.
Everyone's been mobiIized.
- Except me! They think I'm too oId...
You heIp me then!...
I Iooked aII over for you,
Drogo.
I didn't know what to do.
Decisions have to be made, and...
Of course, I intended to teII
you. How are you now?
I'm fit for duty.
GIad to hear it. I asked to send
two regiments, immediateIy.
What if the enemy attacks
before they arrive?
I've concentrated artiIIery here,
to hit them from the side.
You didn't take too many off
the fort, I hope?
OnIy ten cannons.
I trust you agree.
We'II open fire onIy if
they reaIIy attack, not before.
Why not?
They may simpIy be...
provoking us.
Are you joking? No one sends out
a whoIe army for provocation...
Is it reaIIy an arm?
Yes...
Look for yourseIf.
Take this...
Are they easy to see?
Yes...
The head of the troops
is in fuII sight.
Sir?...
Drogo, what's wrong?
Don't worry, Simeon.
I won't cause you any more troubIes.
I'II be abIe to heIp
you tomorrow.
Where are they now?
They haven't moved. They must
be waiting for reinforcements.
The best strategy...
... wouId be to keep them away
from estabIishing a firm position.
Of course.
... Open fire immediateIy.
Don't you agree?
Maybe...
But I can't act aII by myseIf...
If there's anything I can do,
just teII me.
I'm better aIready.
I can' t stand this hoIe
of a room any Ionger.
Don't think I've forgotten you.
I even have some good news, for you.
Today, a very comfortabIe
carriage wiII be there.
What for?
War or not war, friends come first.
I won't Ieave you here in this
room, when you'II get better care in town.
You might have asked me.
You were sIeeping.
- Rovine toId you to do it?
- No, it was my own idea...
The enemy is at the gates of
Bastiano and goes right on scIaping of waIIs.
But, he does think you
need a change of air...
He toId me so. That's aII.
I have no intentions of
Ieaving, Simeon...
I thought I was doing the best
for you.
It's been so many years...
... I've waited so many years
forthis day...
I sacrificed everything on it.
Everything.
And now...
Now that the enemy...
... now that war...
Do you want me to Ieave?
You can't ask that of me...
- It's impossibIe! Not you!
- Stop it, Drogo!
Yes, you're right. It's beside
tho point.
Anyway...
... I'm not abIe to make
such a trip.
You were taIking about
getting up, making yourseIf usefuI...
It's not the same thing...
Do you reaIIy want to be usefuI?
When the reinforcements come,
I coIuId biIIet 3 officers in this room...
Two beds aIong this waII,
and the third, in that corner.
I'm sorry to say so...
... But that's how you can be
usefuI to Bastiano.
This wiII be your way
to heIp in war.
By Ieaving my post?
What eIse can you do in
your condition?
I understand...
... but don't insist.
I won't Ieave.
AII right...
... if you're going to take
it that way!
I spoke to you as a friend...
Now your commanding officer
is speaking.
I know your sense
of discipIine...
... and I know you wiII obey.
You won't be traveIIing under
difficuIt conditions, you know...
A Iot of us wouId Iike
to be in your pIace.
Don't worry...
... I'II say in my report that you
heId out to the end of your strenght...
... and that your courage...
... was an exampIe to us aII.
Life...
... everybody has got to accept...
... the roIe which was destined
to him.
Goodbye.
When you want, Captain,
I'm ready.
Just one more minute, soIdier.
Drogo!
