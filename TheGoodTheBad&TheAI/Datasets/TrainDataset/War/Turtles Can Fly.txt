Pashow, tell my dad
to turn the antenna to the right!
Esmaeel, to the right, the right!
Your son says to the right.
Pashow, tell my dad
to turn it to the left!
Ali, to the left, to the left!
It has noises.
There"s no image.
Look what Saddam has done to us!
We have no water, no electricity,
and no schools.
They have deprived us from the sky.
They don"t let our TVs work to see
when the war will start.
Is it you Satellite?
Hey, is it you Satellite?
Yes, what is it?
I need some rope.
Come back tomorrow!
- I need it now.
- I said tomorrow!
I said I need it now.
All right, fine!
Howmuch do you want?
Pashow!
Satellite, come here for a minute!
My name is Soran.
Everyone calls me Satellite.
Sit down!
I knowthis girl.
She is from Halabcheh.
Halabcheh?! Howdo you know?
I know! Her parents were killed.
They came to the village yesterday.
They want to go to the border
with the rest ofthe refugees.
She has a brother who went
on the mines. He lost his arms.
He hit Abdolrahman with his head.
His nose started to bleed.
He hit him like this.
- Don"t tell anyone!
- Okay.
Why didn"t you give me the rope?
Only 2 or 3 meters was left.
L"II give you more later.
- Howmuch shall I pay?
- No! Don"t even mention the money.
- But I have to pay.
- No! See you later!
Thank you!
Come to me if you need anything!
Hey, what are you doing?
Why aren"t you turning
the antenna? Turn it!
Esmaeel, l"m tired.
You can"t get pictures
with this antenna.
I swearyou won"t ever get pictures
in this village with this antenna.
I said you should buy a satellite.
A satellite!
The village governor says
the satellite is prohibited.
Don"t say that! The sexy and dance
channels are prohibited, not the news.
I installed satellites
for all the villages around here.
Do you know"Sargolli" village?
Withjust 20 families,
they bought a satellite!
- They did?
- Yes!
How strange!
You are 70 families here,
why don"t you buy one?
It"s bad foryour reputation!
But we are only 30 families. Just 30!
What about the houses on that side?
Nowthey are in Turkey.
They have separated us. They won"t
let them pay forthe satellite.
Your wife was from that side.
Nowyou"re strangers?
They have separated us.
Not long nowbefore USA comes!
What"s USA?
USA means America.
Have you seen the movie Titanic?
Titanic, Washington, San Francisco,
Bruce Lee, Zinedine Zidane.
Zeinedin Zeidan is not American.
He is not American.
He"s French and a Muslim.
I knowhim well.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Where is this car going?
- It"s going to Arbil.
Let"s go!
Are you an Iranian Kurd?
Yes! I am an Iranian Kurd,
and a doctor.
Why have you come to Iraq
in this chaos?
This is the fourth time l"ve come.
I come, I go. I come, I go.
L"m looking for an orphan.
I think he"s from Arbil.
He"s driven me nuts.
I don"t knowwhere to find him.
I knowhim.
I know as well too doctor.
What?
Howdo you knowme?
We were sitting in the same car
a fewmonths ago.
You were going to Solaymaneyeh
from Kirkuk, looking forthe orphan.
Exactly!
Howdo you knowhim?
You"re looking forthe boy,
who makes predications, right?
Yes, do you have news ofhim?
I do and I don"t,"I don"t know."
- What does "I don"t know" mean?
- It"s chaos everywhere.
"I don"t know" means I have no idea.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, I knowhim.
Don"t listen to this boy!
It"s all lies.
That boy is very important.
He makes predictions.
These days money is in the news.
My God!
Have you come from Iran forthat?
What are you saying?
War! The world is at war.
Everybody"s after news.
The boy is lying!
Buy a satellite to get the news.
A satellite? What for?
It"s all lies. They lie
and fill their pockets.
Stop!
Stop!
Pashow, who gave them permission
to come here?
I don"t know.
Tell them to go to Karim"s land!
Hurry up!
- Shouldn"t I come with you?
- Hurry!
Hurry up!
Wait here!
Hello!
Hello!
L"ve come with them from "Kanibo"
to buy a satellite dish.
It"s too expensive.
You can"t buy one.
Howmuch is it?
Maybe I can give you some discount.
- Don"t you have any cheaper ones?
- It"s war; it"s the end ofthe world.
If you don"t have money,
don"t buy it.
I have a fewradios.
Can we exchange?
Radios?
Radios have no value any more.
Only cash for satellites.
Can we can give you some radios
and pay halfin cash?
What?
Half ofit in radios
and half ofit in cash.
Okay, howmany radios
do you have?
- Howmuch cash?
- 500.
Put those on the table!
Okay take the dish!
"Hello Mr.!"
"How are you?"
Hello, satellite!
Have you seen these mines?
Who found them?
The armless boy
who hit Abdol Rahman in the face.
Didn"t I tell you to work
on Karim"s land?
The boy didn"t let us go there.
He told us to work on this field.
It"s full of mines.
I don"t knowhowhe found out.
It"s unbelievable!
All ofthis is my work.
I did the work of 3 days in one day.
I told you only
to collect American mines.
He said there is no difference
between Italian and American mines.
He said anybody
who says the opposite is a liar.
Liar? He called me a liar?
Where is he?
He is there!
Where?
There! Up there!
Hey, you! Come down!
Hey, come down!
Why don"t you come down?
This place is full of mines.
Did you call me a liar?
Howdare you talk like that?
Come down here if you"re a man!
Nobody has ever called me a liar.
Look at that filth!
The armless boy calls me a liar.
Do you understand?
L"m talking to you.
You are the liar.
Can"t you hear me? Are you deaf?
If you call me a liar again,
l"II give you a good beating!
I knowyou well.
I won"t say anything...
because of your sister.
Do you get it?
Don"t go, Hengov!
- Are you talking to me?
- I knowyou well.
- I said are you talking to me?
- Yes, to you!
Satellite!
What happened, Satellite?
Blood! Blood!
Move out ofthe way!
Did youjust hit me?
Come back!
Look at him! He doesn"t dare stop.
L"II forgive you foryour sister.
It better be your last time.
Stop if you dare!
L"II cut offboth your legs too.
Bring it! Bring it!
"Come on! Come on!"
This way!
Esmaeel, l"ve brought you
my antenna.
You won"t find another one like this
anywhere else in the world.
Don"t lie so much!
Didn"t we buy it together in Arbil?
Bring it!
Be careful with it!
Be careful! Watch your hands!
Go down by the count of 3!
"One, two, three!"
Shirkooh, you go down too!
Satellite!
What does "Come on" mean?
"Come on!" means go down.
Hurry up!
- Hello!
- Hello!
We"ve come to see war news.
What do the foreign channels say?
There"s no news, nothing.
Go back to your homes!
There"s no need for all of you
to come here.
Go back to yourtents!
We"II announce the news
on the mosque speaker.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course!
Go back to yourtents!
We"II give you the news

You don"t have to worry
while l"m here.
Hello! Who are they?

They want to see the news.

Okay! Who told you to touch it?
Go to the mosque!
- What for?
- Bring the mosque microphone.
- What ifthe governor doesn"t accept?
- The governor is here himself.
Hurry up!
Okay! I have to go now.
Where to?

which I did.
I have to go now. I did my job.

forthe village children.
I have to make
income forthem.
L"II give you money.
L"II give you accommodation.
- Accommodation? You won"t.
- I will.
No, you won"t.
Last time you promised
but you didn"t.
I will. Come and sit down!
We will help you.
I told you not to show
the prohibited channels. Change it!
Don"t hit me! L"m looking for
a news channel.
Change it! Change it!
It"s prohibited!
Here is Mr. Bush, Esmaeel!
The world is in his hands!
I know! I know!
The world is in his hands.
What is this Bush saying?
Let the teacher come and tell you.
It"s not my job.
- He doesn"t know anything!
- The teacher doesn"t know anything?
I sawhim write 28 letters in English
to Mr. Bush with my own eyes.
Try to understand!
Try your best! Tell us
what they are saying.
He says it will rain tomorrow.
What has it got to do with rain?
He keeps saying
it will rain tomorrow!
What"s the relationship?
- I think it"s a code!
- What code?
Here Satellite!
The mosque microphone!
Go! L"II come in a minute.
Here is Saddam! L"m done here.
You understand Arabic.
Where are you going?
We need you.
All the village children are waiting
for me. I have to go.
Come back forthe news tonight!
I want to know about the war.
All right! We"II see.
Riga?
Agrin, where"s Riga?
- I don"t know.
- What do you mean you don"t know?
What"s this child doing here?
- Whose child are you?
- Why are you crying?
What"s your name?
I think it"s the brother
ofthe girl from Halabcheh.
Don"t cry! Don"t cry!
Look! I scared him. He"s gone.
- Howmany is this?
- Leave him alone! He can"t see.
Look what l"m doing
with the Turk soldier.
Hey, Effendi!
Hey Mr.! Are you fine?
Do you want us to start a war?
Hey, let"s go before he kills us.
We didn"t want to harm your brother.
He was standing at the border
and he was crying.
He could"ve got killed.
Lfit weren"t for Satellite
your brother would be dead.
My bike!
What are you doing here?
Where"s my bike?
I sawyour bike here.
I waited foryou but you didn"t come.
Then Esmaeel came
and asked where you were.
I told him I didn"t know.
He wanted to take your bike with him.
I told him not to.
He said he would. I said no.
Again he said he would.
I told him I won"t let him.
He slapped me on both cheeks,
like this and took the bike.
Why did you let him?
He said Satellite must come
and translate the news for us.
Howdare he take my chastity?
Pashow, go with him!
Tell him I can"t translate
during the day,
maybe a little at night.
L"II go from this village.
Tell him all the villages
in the region want me.
Lfhe doesn"t bring my bike back,
l"II leave this village with the dish.
Lfthey don"t return the bike,
l"II leave now. Go, tell him!
Bring it up! Watch the mud!
Followme!
Esmaeel sent his regards.
He said don"t leave. He said
whatever Satellite says is fine.
Where are the kids?
They are collecting mines
with the armless boy.
With him?
Those who work for me
aren"t allowed to work with him.
I won"t buy mines today, understand?
Those who want to work with me
must come to the shell field tomorrow.
Goodbye foreverto those
who don"t work with me!
Why are you crying again?
I went afteryour bike with them.
Esmaeel called me
and slapped me again twice, like this.
I asked why he hit me. He said
it was my ration fortomorrow!
Come on! Bring me down!
Go to your home kids!
We"II go to the shell field tomorrow!
Come and sit here!
Watch your child!
I will only give 10 Dinars to those
who want to work today.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Mummy!
Satellite!
Yes! What is it?
The armless boy said something will
happen to those working in that truck.
- Who said this?
- The armless boy.
- Which truck?
- That one!
I swear I heard it with my own ears.
He left with his brother and sister.
Kids, Kids, listen to me!
Those working in that truck,
evacuate the place immediately.
Quickly! Something may explode!
Satellite!
Not all ofthem are our boys.
It"s doesn"t matter. Everyone get
off! Aren"t you getting off?
My kids get off now! Hurry up!
Hold my bike!
Hey you! Wait!
Hey! Don"t you know someone
like yourself who has no arms?
And who can tell the future?
You don"t? You knowit"s you.
I won"t tell anyone.
Make some predications for us!
Slowly, slowly!
Listen! Use this mask
when you see white smoke.
Don"t use it for black smoke!
It"s only for smoke smelling of
garlic and grass.
There is a mask for every family.
Those who don"t have masks
must go under water or in the river...
...during a chemical attack.
If you don"t find water,
go to high places.
Look at this boy
to learn howto use it!
Listen, war doesn"t warn ofits
coming.
Bombardment could start any time.
Put the mask on like this
and pull it down overyourface.
Come! Don"t you want a mask?
Shirkooh, come here!
Yes, Satellite! At your service!
Give this mask to that girl!
Tell her l"II find a smaller mask
for her brother.
Hello!
Satellite has sent this mask foryou.
He said he would find one
foryour brother.
Out ofthe way!
Sorry! It"s Satellite"s orders!
Goodbye!
He said he will definitely find one
foryour brothertoo.
This way! This way! That"s fine!
Nowgo down!
This is the house I promised you.
Today we have many customers.
OK, relax!
I am talking to the refugee children,
not the village children.
Today you will clear
Aziz"s field from mines.
Wait there
until my representative arrives!
- Where are you going?
- To Aziz"s field!
- OK!
- OK!
You can go
and gatherthe mines there.
If anybody makes trouble,
l"II deal with him.
L"II count to three.
"One! Two!" Go!
Get out! Get out!
Now, you come with me
to see the Mr.
Wait here! L"II go and bargain.
L"II try to sell the mines
at the best price. Let"s go!
"Hello, Mr.! How are you?"
Why don"t you speak properly?
What was that, Ahmad?
There"s money in "Hello" these days.
Lfl don"t say hello,
no one answers back.
Do you see these boys?
They don"t knowyou"re Kurd.
They think you"re a foreigner.
The Americans are coming.
Learn 2 "OKs" and all will be fine.
"OK, Mr.! Howmuch mine?"
Howmuch forthe mines today?
- Howmany have you got?
- 96.
You used to bring 10 or 15.
What"s happened?
Don"t think about that!
Howmuch?
What? 22 Dinars?
Are you pulling my leg?
You paid more before.
You think I don"t knowthat you sell
them to UN for 2200 Dinars each?
I even knowhowmuch they get for it.
Even their dogs make 50 times more
than our children do!
And they give them
a can of food to eat as well!
You can help our kids as a Kurd.
Are you kidding me?
I don"t care if you sell or not.
Go and sell them to the Mr. Yourself.
Give me a higher price, OK!
OK! L"II try. Nowgo!
"Thank you very much Mr.!!"
Come down! Come down!
OK! OK! I arranged everything.
It was hard work fixing things up.
What would you do without me?!
These people have come
afterthe children.
- Where are they?
- They"re waiting.
Hey, Satellite! What about our lands?
We"ve been waiting since morning.
Wait a minute!
I talked to him until he agreed.
Go back to your homes now!
Get your mines!
Then go to the Mr. With Pashow,
the guy who has a pony-tail!
When you get there, give him
the mines and get your money.
What about my land?
Howmany children do you want?
Send them all! It"s ten days
since the last mine collection.
OK! OK!
You and you!
Me?
Take care of yourselves!
Half ofthem don"t have hands!
So what? They are not afraid of mines.
They are our best.
- Howmany do you want Karim?
- 50.
L"II send you 5.
You, you, you...
Satellite! The girl from Halabcheh!
Pashow, look afterthe children!
L"II be back soon.
Out ofthe way!
My cap! My cap!
Thank you!
L"m at your service.
Agrin today is a strange day for me.
Howdo you knowmy name?
That is beside the point.
Anyhow, today is important.
Why?
Why? Do you see this bike?
This is the first time I am carrying
water on it. And it"sjust foryou.
All the villages around here
take their brides home on this bike.
L"II take it myself.
Don"t say that! I am at your service.
Any news of your brother?
Does he have any predictions for us?
No!
Nothing at all?
- My brother doesn"t do it anymore.
- Why?
He made predictions twice
and it brought us bad luck twice.
What happened?
Don"t you want to tell me?
- Give it to me! L"II take it.
- I am at your service. Please!
- Is this a spring as well?
- Yes!
- Why don"t they take waterfrom here?
- L"m the only one who does.
Why?
The villagers say the water is impure.
Why?
Last year, three children came here
to look for red fish
and never came up.
I think they drowned.
I swear I dived to the bottom.
I sawmany fish,
but no children.
- Is it very deep?
- Yes.
Are there red fish in it?
Yes, I sawthem myself.
- Did you really see them?
- Don"t you believe me?
- Can you go to the bottom?
- Yes, l"II do it now.
Lfl ask you something
will you get upset?
No!
As you"re from Halabcheh,
do you know someone like yourself
who doesn"t have anyone
in this world, like you or I?
It"s okay if she has two brothers!
Have you lost anyone?
No, I haven"t lost anyone.
I have another point.
I have been looking for a girl
like you, foryears.
Where are you going?
Didn"t you want me to catch you fish?
L"II go now. Look!
Wait! Wait!
L"II catch red fish foryou!
Are you awake?
I knowwhy you can"t sleep.
When are we leaving here?
Don"t you want to tell me?
Put the child in the middle
maybe we can sleep.
You won"t be able to sleep
unless you learn to like the child.
Howmany times do I have to tell you
he"s not my child.
Don"t say it isn"t!
You say such things...
The rope around his foot
opens mysteriously
and he walks in his sleep.
Hengov, I have a toothache.
Are you still in pain? Is it bad?
Yes, it is painful.
Put some kerosene on it!
Don"t pull my hair!
I said let go of my hair.
Hey, why are you hitting the child?
Agrin, where did you take him?
I don"t know.
Howcome?
Why is his nose bleeding?
I don"t know. I can"t take care of
a bastard all night long!
What was that?
You said bastard again?
Lfhe is not a bastard,
then what is he?
Isn"t he the child ofthose who killed
ourfamily and did this to me?
Nowhe"s my child?
Come into my arms!
Don"t cry! Don"t cry!
Cover him! Put the blanket on him!
- Where are you taking him?
- None of your business!
Wait! Wait!
Where is this boy going?
Come down! It is a good opportunity
to help him.
What about me?
Wait here until I come back!
Agrin!
Enough.
Leave her alone!
Where are you going
in such a hurry?
The boy has made
an important prediction.
Out ofthe way.
Hello!
Attention! Attention!
Important notice
for the villagers of "Kanibo"!
For the refugees who live around here.
The war will begin in a fewhours.
The war between
Iraq and America will start.
Are you serious?
Yes! There will be war.
Save yourselves!
They didn"t say anything
on the news.
The satellite
will announce it now!
What are you doing here?
Why aren"t you on the hill?
Like the others?
I want to put my turtles in the water.
I hope this prediction is not a lie.
All the people are on the hill.
If you"ve lied, l"II lose face.
I told them it was true
and the war"s about to start.
I said the USA planes are coming.
I lied that I had heard the news
on the satellite this morning.
I hope it is not ajoke.
I hear something.
I swear I do.
- It"s the sound ofit!
- What noise?
The noise of American passports!
Where are you?
Only this much left to America!
Let"s go!
Over here it"s written:
"It"s the end ofinjustice,
misfortune and hardship."
"We are your best friends
and brothers."
"Those against us are our enemies."
"We will make this country a
paradise."
"We are here to take away
your sorrows."
"We are the best in the world."
We can only rent 2 weapons
for 3 months with these mines.
Get the hill behind the school
and Rahman"s roof ready.
OK! Go and get them!
It"s a bad situation!
Come on kids!
- Hello!
- Hello! Welcome!
- How are you Abdol Salam?
- Welcome Satellite! Long time no see!
L"ve come to take two weapons
for "Kanibo". The Russian PKC type!
They are expensive.
The price has gone up.
They"re 3500, 3600 Dinars.
I don"t want to buy it;
I want to rent it for 3 months.
For rent? Forthree months
it"II be 600, 650 Dinars.
L"ve got 500, 600 Dinars
worth of mines.
OK!
Put them overthere!
Come here! Turn around!
I picked these mines myself.
- Do you have any small masks?
- L"II bring some soon.
These are American mines. First class.
Give him the weapons!
These are good weapons.
Don"t ruin them!
Pashowput these in the bag!
These bullets aren"t enough.
L"II give you more
when you need some.
Howmuch is this necklace?
It"s "International"!
Satellite,
what does "International" mean?
This is no time for questions.
Go!
Goodbye till next time!
L"m fed up. When will we leave?
We will leave soon.
Be patient!
I can"t stand anymore.
What are we doing here?
Why aren"t we leaving?
I had a dream.
We"II go in 2 or 3 days,
when the child is cured.
We"II go together.
We won"t leave together.
If you"re trying to cure the child,
I won"t come.
If you don"t come, l"II go alone.
The child understands everything.
Loweryour voice!
Howmany times must I tell you?
Everyone"s leaving. Only we"re left.
Uncle Hengov, will you remove this?
Of course!
Come closer!
Does it hurt?
Remove it!
Let me see! Look,
it is not bleeding now!
- What is this?
- Throwit away!
If you don"t come, l"II go alone.
You say you want to go everyday.
Why don"t you leave then?
Leave if you want to!
Howcan I go alone?
Howwould you manage with the child?
Let"s leave.
If we don"t leave this child now,
we will never be able to do that.
Let"s go!
Someone will find him
and take care ofhim.
We"II all go together.
We won"t go with him.
What will we tell people
when he grows up?
Shall we say we found him
in the streets?
What will we tell him
when he grows up?
Hengov, let"s go!
Somebody will take him!
L"m leaving.
Mummy!
Where are you?
Hurry! Hurry up! Quick!
Didn"t I say no one is allowed
to have weapons in the school?
Teacher, how are you today?
Do you think this is a good place
for shooting?
The white flag is enough.
This is the best place for weapons.
The best place.
Oh, brother!
Hey, work hard!
Hey you, work harder!
All you do is go to villages
and mess them up.
You"II make trouble
forthe kids someday.
What? Me? Did I mess them up?
Do I make trouble forthe children?
Lfit hadn"t been for me,
they would have beenjobless.
Can"t you hearthe explosions?
War is coming closerto us.
It"s war, teacher!
We have to get weapons ready.
Hey, why aren"t you listening?
Teach them Math and Science!
They knowMath and Science.
They have to learn
howto shoot now.
They have to learn howto use masks.
Look teacher!

I sawit myself.
There are lots of Americans here.
The refugees are coming back
to the city.
Howdid you find out?
I sawit myself.
All the children are on the hill.
Why have they gone up there?
When the Americans got here,
they went to Esmaeel.
They took his dish
and carried it to the hill.
The children are watching
the prohibited channels
with the American soldiers.
They are watching
the prohibited channels?
Where is Shirkooh?
He"s going to the city

I sold all my mines to get it.
The Americans said
it"s very expensive.
- Howdid you learn their language?
- You taught me!
The Americans said not to collect
American mines any more.

these.
