enemy anticipated invasion.

defend the freedom of Europe and culture.
They are equipped

their very combat experienced leaders.

Germany can sleep safely .
Thank you. Great. Stay there , we will
up and shooting close-ups .
Do what you want , as long as you delay
invasion by a week.
- Fuehrer's adjutant is here.
- Thank you, Aldinger .
I need your support. High German
officers that the Russians captured -
- Have sent letters to officers
and urged them to stop the war.
They're dictated by Stalin himself .
Unfortunately not. There is clear evidence
that the letters are not forged.
- Do you also have one?
- No. And then I ripped it .
Now that the war escalates ,
Fuhrer must know with certainty -
- That there is a one-off
and that the field marshal is loyal .
- The Führer knows I am loyal .
- Hostile flight !
Give me , Aldinger .
They have not seen us yet.
- Daniel , try to reach the forest.
- They face . They 've found us !
- Maybe you should sit down .
Gasa . Faster.
- Where do you see the problems we have here.
Not a German plane in sight.
The allies chasing us like hares.
Stop!
In here. Fort . - This Way . In there .
Do not, you still can not hit .
In there . Quick!
Shit !
Survived all ?
" On all soldiers
and officers' behalf " -

to the Führer and National Socialism. "
"Therefore , we promise to do all we can
for every soldier " -
- " To fight even more intense
of National Socialism 's future. "
" Berchtesgarden , March 15, 1944 ".
My adjutant was very impressed
of his visit to the Atlantic Wall .
I look forward to your progress .
This was two weeks ago
off Plymouth .
The enemy appears prepare
a landing .
They also gather force
English Channel. At least 50 divisions.
- They will then in a few weeks .
- About
They have practiced this before .
It 's obvious that the Allies
must come west.
I 'm really looking forward
their departure .
What do you think?
Where will they try ?
They are probably trying here , in Calais.
Or in Normandy.
The two peninsulas offer
excellent opportunities for bridgeheads .
How the enemy will act?
First they bombarded our positions.
Then attack boats
and armored landing vehicles -
- Under the cover of artillery and bombers .
Airborne troops placed behind the front.
What is your counter-move ?
The enemy will be killed at the landing .
The beach is the battle line .
Empty talk , Mr. Rommel . How defends
to an over 2,000 km of coastline ?
We miss forces.
We place all armored divisions
to the coast. I 'll show you.
Within three months , it looks like this
everywhere on the Atlantic Wall .
Barriers hinder
for landing boats.
Artillery shells them
directly at the landing .
And we have no artillery in place,
taking armor units over .
If the enemy breaks through at one point
on fältmarskalkens defense line
- Empire is defenseless .
When the Allies marching to Berlin.
Our tanks can only follow.
Our tanks kill all enemies
who disembarked in 48 hours.
Before the tanks get there , it has
enemy plane bombed them apart .
Mein Führer ... I ask you to give me
command of armored forces .
Only then can we prevent
enemy invasion.
Then we put everything on one card .
Without strategic reserves .
As commander in chief in the West
I allow it .
But for three years, have you allowed
Atlantic Wall to be inadequate.
While Rommel short time
has done exemplary work .
An invasion must be strictly avoided.
For one thing is certain :
If the landing fails,
do not they try again .
Then we can redirect forces
where we need them - in the East.
All 45 divisions.
war output
depends on you and your soldiers.
And even Reich
and the fate of the nation .
- Do you realize that, Field Marshal ?
- Yes, my Führer .
Can you at least wait
at Manfred ? He will be disappointed.
Tell him . We have very little time before
the enemy is coming, and much to do.
- You can do it .
- I must.
Fuhrer expects
I save the kingdom .
How nice that he trusts you again .
FRANCE
April 15, 1944
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
There you are .
We were expecting you earlier , General.
We were chased by enemy aircraft .
Their superiority in the air is our largest
problems . My adjutant , Captain Aldinger .
Take the general's baggage .
- You will get to meet my staff , Speidel .
- How's the cheese ?
- The Russian offensive can not be stopped.
Führer's orders are catastrophic .
They give unnecessary coincident ,
and prevents the front moved.
- Move the front?
- For Reich boundaries, if possible.
Then do not negotiate the enemy with us.
Would you like to be humiliated ?
- No.
- We will prevent the invasion.
Only then may the Führer
a strong bargaining position .
Gentlemen,
our new Chief of Staff , General Speidel .
Nice .
Countess La Rochefoucauld ,
Castle owner's nephew .
- Bonjour.
- Comtesse , bonjour .
She speaks excellent German.
She interprets for us.
- Er famous ancestor , the author ?
- Yes.
" La jeunesse
est une Ivresse continuelle . "
- It was well he ?
- Yes.
Youth is a continual intoxication.
The reason is fever.
Who did you mean , Speidel ? There's
just a youth here , Countess.
- It happened just like that.
- The Countess knows what is proper .
- Are you sure?
- Are not you ?
good evening .
- Bonsoir .
It easily becomes a villain .
Not true Speidel ?
Here at Calvados Coast
we still have a gap of 40 kilometers.
If the tanks will not
it looks dark.
The Führer has promised to curb units
will . You get your tanks.
We must move obstacles ahead ,
Marcks .
The Allies
practice landing at low tide now.
So it looks . But we 'll give them
long way to the beach.
How ? I can not tire out the men
with pick and shovel .
I have rested soldiers.
That's the problem . Your men are too
rested after three years of beach vacations.
See the doctor Speidel . He was
on the eastern front , but he laments ?
I lost my leg on the eastern front.
And with all due respect , I tell you :
Your plan requires a minimum of one year.
Anyone who says otherwise ...
- ... Hide the truth or does not know.
- What do you imagine ?
The Führer has given me orders to
prevent the Allied landing .
And a slacker like you
should not hinder me.
Now make sure to get the job done.
Yes.
Maybe it was a little rough , but otherwise
nothing happens here , believe me.
Wait, Marcks .
- He knows Marcks is absolutely right.
- Your men have been frequent . Sorry.
PARIS
April 25, 1944
German military ADMINISTRATION
It has happened to some here , Hans.
Paris Jews was sent to the East,
but traffic continues ...
And SS chasing even Jewish children ,
that residents are hiding .
The local SS last idea.
Resistance bomb stations and
then exploded even wagons are doors .
Some Jews fled. To prevent
there transported the now bare.
Come on .
Colonel Hofacker ,
Count Stauffenberg's cousin.
- General.
- Nice to meet you .
Berlin would finally act.
Therefore, they asked me to trust myself to you .
- It's about Rommel .
- Rommel ?
Can he convince
to participate in kupplanerna ?
He will do anything to succeed in the West.
He wants to prevent the invasion.
Convince him. Is Rommel with ,
we get the support of the front.
And of the people. Do not forget
he is our most popular general .
A major step : from Fuhrer minion
the figurehead of the coup.
- But the only thing possible .
- I must see him.
Preferably without the Gestapo know .
Can you arrange that?
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
April 28, 1944
- Guderian decides on the tanks .
- Not Führer ?
Führer asked me to inspect them and
submit recommendation. What do you think ?
It should be the second Panzer division ,
Geyr . Yet is this .
The enemy disembark quickly airborne
divisions with anti-tank guns .
That's why the tanks no avail
the coast, with the enemy in the back.
The enemy does your tanks to reach
coast and can build their beachhead .
How do you protect our tanks
from their sjöartilleri ?
We bury them.
- Bury them?
- Yes.
Is not their strength in combination
of armor , firepower and mobility?
During the campaign against France was traveling
s spökdivision not fast enough.
Führer has expressly approved
my plans.
He has not decided yet.
Until then reads armored divisions
under the Commander in the West.
Then we can end this now.
It did not go well in Africa.
Now he wants to be something here.
Get him to see reason .
He can not prevent an attack
with infantry hiding behind tanks.
- Field Marshal knows what he's doing.
- Really?
Actually , he has never been more
than a viable division commander .
So it is with the Führer. The last
who meets him is always right.
Let's go a round , Speidel .
Rundstedt is old and tired.
He gave up a long time ago .
And Guderian has been a yes men .
Take the consequences.
- Take matters into your own hands.
- What do you mean?
Request to be commander in chief in the West.
Give Hitler an ultimatum .
- He needs you. You are well-liked.
- Should I threaten Führer ?
- If you want to prevent the invasion.
- So, you achieve nothing with the Führer.
Less you , recognize the people and the Fuhrer
that the war can not be won .
Quiet, Speidel . I want you here
as chief of staff a while.
- What liberally to let them stay here.
- Thoughtless , you mean ?
The French aristocracy
fear the Bolsheviks more than we do.
Count worship the Fuhrer .
That kid man is his son.
As old as our Manfred.
Our son is air defense aide in Ulm.
Recently , he wanted to join the Waffen- SS.
I forbade him to do so.
Now you may ask , but ...
You know, I 've heard
terrible stories .
If the mass executions . and massacres
of Jews in the occupied territories .
You were on the eastern front .
Can you confirm this?
It also takes place in France.
They yet deporting Jews.
SS searching through
for hidden Jewish children .
- How do you know?
- In Paris, army management , there ...
... those who do not find themselves in it .
So yeah ... You have to get used to the lightning
and thunder to be a soldier .
Our Manfred cried too
when he was photographed .
Stülpnagel . Speidel cheated well not here
me to calm screaming babies?
A MANSION NEAR PARIS
In case of extreme emergency must
forcing Hitler to yield.
- What do you mean by "force" ?
- To arrest him .
And bring him to justice for
the crimes he has committed in the name of the people .
Mr von Stülpnagel ,
what you are proposing is a military coup.
Do you think you can find a single general
ready for that?
A group of prominent men
at our disposal .
There have been coup plans
even earlier.
Some yielded their
to liberate Germany from Hitler.
Daring to their lives ?
- An attack , then?
- Not if it can be avoided .
Know all about it?
- Only in Berlin , the details .
- It is high treason.
Hitler betray long Germany.
Closes we are not at peace with the Allies
Now , the Russians take Berlin in the autumn.
Although you have sworn an oath .
Do not forget it .
Now he runs to the Führer .
How long have you known
these plans ?
A while.
You know what is required of me
the obedient soldier.
Do what you must do.
Damn it .
Give it here . It can be mended .
FRANCE , THE CHANNEL COAST
Now .
Watch out ! They come, they come !
Here we go ! It begins!
Miss. Damn, then.
Speidel , dammit . What is happening?
Have Englishmen landed ?
- A British raid averted near Calais .
- On the Channel coast ?
A British military officers were arrested.
He was handed over to the Gestapo.
- In Paris ?
- You can be the chain of command.
SS HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS
His squad
would blow up coastal battery.
Good, Lieutenant General .
We'll take him.
- What ?
- Rommel want to meet him.
You can command the order. he
to be executed as soon as he talked .
- He certainly has not spoken yet.
- Within 12 hours , you know ...

- Certainly. But we have our methods.
You tell enough for me
if your methods sometime.
Feel it . - Take him away .
Watch out .
- Here is the British lieutenant .
- Take off his handcuffs .
How is my old friend Montgomery?
- Translate .
- He understands you.
- How the Brits want war now?
- And what was there in Africa?
- Tjafs . Compared to what awaits .
Have a seat .
Well , Lieutenant ...
Actually , we have the same enemy .
And he 's in Russia.
- Why do we fight not side by side?
- It would be hard .
We Brits think that certain things
you Germans do, is disgusting.
- What do you mean?
- The way you treat Jews .
It's politics. We are soldiers.
We have nothing to do with politics .
That your Führer exterminate an entire people ,
is it just politics?
- It could change.
- It's too late , Field Marshal .
- Countess .
- What will happen to him ?
He's way in war camps
for British prisoners.
And command the order, then?
- What do you know about it?
- You hear a lot.
- I'll make sure nothing happens to him .
- But can you do it?
- Yes , I'm the commander in chief .
- There are many in France.
And then there's the SS.
Countess . Wait a minute.
Excuse me ... but can you get hold of
those here in Paris?
- For my wife's birthday.
- You have good taste.
S uncle hope
that we can beat back the enemy.
What do you hope ?
- Who are you ?
- We are lost , whatever.
Given our fortifications,
morale of the troops -
- Our new armament
and the weapons we have been given -
- We look forward to coming times
with great calm .
And ...
... do not worry
about how it should go. It's fine .
And I do not
that the British are returning for a second time .
- Was it good?
- Excellent . Very convincing.
Good .
I heard that a British soldier
was captured in Calais.
- Do you believe that the invasion happens there ?
- The place where you least expect it .
Then they learn to come to me .
They go to church on Sunday , will set sail
on Monday and will be here on Tuesday.
- Why do you think that?
- My birthday is on Tuesday.
- My wife too.
- There you are .
From the high command ,
Colonel General Jodl .
- Hell .
- Bad news ?
Führer gives me three armored divisions .
The rest I ask later.
Should I send a written request
when the enemy lands ?
I have to meet Hitler.
He gets misinformation
of the bad guys around him.
- Do you really believe that?
- You and your friends do not believe it .
But what do you expect ?
That I passively watching the chaos ?
I do not remember as commander
who led his soldiers to slaughter.
- There are other options .
- I do not believe in them.
Put me through to the Führer's headquarters.
The Fuehrer 's adjutant . I can not wait.
Do you like shoes?
A birthday present for my wife.
Very elegant . She'll be happy enough.
It will be storm and very cloudy
until 10 June.
So you can safely go .

He is sorry that you were against

I have not changed my mind .
I'm glad you could come.
I'm going to the Führer .
Problems in France.
Put yourself . You seem a little irritable.
Lu, do you remember where
as Strölin recently told ?
- That the gas kill Jews in the East?
- Please stop .
Strölin a Nazi
and Lord Mayor of Stuttgart.
Although he has sent Jews to the East.
Why does he say so ?
It happens even in France,
before my eyes .
I thought there were isolated cases.
But those at the top are not decent .
What do you mean by "those at the top" ?
You know where we live ,
what was here before.
Yes.
- A jew boarding school.
- Then we should move.
Do not believe that.
We are not preventing him from speaking
in radio , he gets to the masses .
We must be
as eloquent as Hitler.
Are we not,
it does not help with an attack .
- Yes, Colonel ?
- A radio monitors ...
perceived ... the end of the message.
Colonel General von Salmuth has set
the whole army on alert in Calais.
Should I alert the seventh in Normandy ?
Call Rundstedts staff .
Let them decide.
So here we go ...
It's probably just the usual hysteria .
NORMANDY
There they are. I knew it.
Notify Rommel's staff

- The country set there too.
With cargo glider . The two prisoners
there will be more land subsidence .

Yes ?
Roger that. Very good . Thank you.

The British are attacking with straw dolls.
But he thinks he can handle it

With heartfelt congratulations

Take good care of them , Karolina .
They are from the Führer.
Commander Loistl , Army Group B.
Sure . Just a moment .
You have a telephone, Field Marshal .
It must be Fuhrer headquarters.
Yes ? Speidel ? What gives?
Have they landed ? Where?
How does our counterattack ?
Let division attack directly .
Do not wait for reinforcements. Seizures.
- I'm sorry.
- It can not be helped.
- Now, in all cases the waiting over .
- Yes.
Take care, Lu . Take care.
They do not fit , Karolina .
Rommel HEADQUARTERS ,

I hope it looks better now.
The enemy has already landed
They control 130 square kilometers.
British 6th Airborne Division -
- Have taken the bridge over the Orne .
They also crushed our artillery
Merville , albeit with heavy losses .
- Is that all?
- The information is scarce.
Radio traffic disturbed by the enemy.
The French have sabotaged
telephone lines and roads maintenance .
We must expect
a second major offensive .
They have darkened the coast at Dover.
Say it out loud , Speidel .
You have failed .
Fuhrer HEADQUARTERS
In MARGIVAL , 17 JUNI 1944
Field Marshal Erna von Rundstedt
and Rommel .
Thanks for coming .
Go ahead and sit down.
I must say I am speechless over
your local masters failures.
The armed forces were taken by surprise
with his pants down .
That says a lot
about the condition of your soldiers .
That's the enemy propaganda.
Call it what you want.
But the landing was not hindered .
- What you assured would happen.
- The forces fighting sacrificing.
That we could not prevent the invasion
is anti-aircraft and naval wrong.
The Army has made ??a superhuman effort
in an unequal battle.
But the enemy's superiority in the air
and that their fleet had to work undisturbed
- Made it impossible
to fight the enemy as planned.
It is unfortunate that no ... for over -
command knew the situation at the front.
Instead
believed in the enemy's propaganda.
It is crucial to maintain Cherbourg .
If not, take the enemy Normandy
- And maybe all of France.
We must choose between keeping ...
Cherbourg ... and to prevent the enemy .
We can not do both.
Do you have the same opinion , von Rundstedt ?
We must give up the rigid system
by Peninsula
- And embark on an orderly retreat
to the port and fortress .
And at Caen, in front of Orne,
we should avoid ...
We will not know anything! It applies
to stand up, hold on and die!
Designate a particular skilled commander
Cherbourg .
Show field groomsmen how devastating
our retaliation is the enemy.
Since yesterday , we have continually fired
V1 missiles against London.
All bar one ton of explosives .
We have received many great hits .
According to our agents can handle civil
population not much more, and ...
A hostile bomb dressing
approaching our airspace .
My Führer , we should probably
go to the shelter.
And now ? We need to tell
that the situation is hopeless.
- He only listens to you.
- You are the commander in chief in the West.
My power is just enough to move
my guards from left to right.
My Führer , you know
I am your faithful servant.
- Can I ?
- Have a seat .
Do not you think ...
... it's time
to consider other options?
- What do you mean?
- To negotiate .
No longer want to negotiate with me.
The enemy thinks obliterate Germany.
Now we only have each individual
fanatical resistance.
Are you prepared for that?
Are you prepared for it, Rommel ?
Yes.
" Where knowledge and ability ends
and intuition takes over " -
- " In the sensory perception ability
and inspiration " -
- "Are general's leadership.
It possesses Rommel . "
You certainly amuses you .
- General Field Marshal .
- Good criticism?
Here you are.
Fuehrer wants to keep Cherbourg .
And stand west of the Orne .
Begin the necessary preparations ,
Speidel .
Can General Marcks do
a diversion ?
General Marcks killed
in a hostile air attack .
Do you want today's total loss figures?
No, it is not necessary.
Gentlemen .
GERMAN POSITION NEAR CAEN
Once you have taken the height , you protect
road to Bayeux. Best of luck.
Thank you, Field Marshal .
- Let the Brits have a fiery !
- Yes, Field Marshal !
Good .
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Field Marshal .
- Back , Daniel. We must return.
- It is madness . We must here .
Oh well ...
Well, Daniel. Run.
Who's there?
Come forward . Hello?
Sorry. It was not supposed
to scare you.
- What are the Countess this?
- I often come here . It's beautiful.
Our soldiers may think you are
partisan, or British agent .
- Maybe I am.
- Then I might look up.
- I would be a great trophy for the British.
- Yes. Desert Fox .
Long time no see . Now I am only he
who could not stop the invasion .
- I'm sorry you do it?
- I am a soldier. Do not forget it .
I 'll tell the men
that you are walking around up here.
I must not lose heart .
Although much hope has been dashed .
Yes ?
The Russians have broken through
Army Group Mitte.
Seven German divisions have surrendered.
The front is in dissolution .
It's probably out of the east.
Yes.
It will be nice when next week is over.
There was one more thing.
- Where is it?
- Småstaden Oradour , near Limoges .
a SS- Panzer division
leveled it to the ground.
All residents were killed ...
which 450 women and children.
- Revenge of the abducted SS officer .
- How do you know this?
Army management .
Stülpnagel have already protested.
Hitler has banned the responsible
officer successor to justice.
Really?
Good night.
Good night.
Poor bastards . Mom said I should
thank God that I ended up with you.
- Why?
- With you , nothing can happen to me.
The new quartermaster ,
Colonel Finckh , has come now.
- He wants to present itself .
- Good, I will soon.
- Field Marshal ...
- What is it?
Führer want you to do a dissipative
attacks against Americans in Cherbourg .
He wants to 7th Army, advancing
on the west flank.
Explain that we are only able to keep
our defense line in western Normandy.
The front is inappropriate for an attack.
Today telephoned General Marcks brother.
He wanted to know exactly to the minute
when the general died .
Why ?
At 11 o'clock that day fell general's
photo down from the wall of his brother.
- And ?
- General met ten forty-five .
- Exactly 11 , he died . Unbelievable, huh ?
- Do you believe in miracles ?
It just makes Hitler. LEASTWAYS
what the course of the war .
"Do not say bridgehead , but the last part
of France as the enemy occupying. "
Cherbourg fall within three days.
Within four weeks of the enemy breaks through
and storms to the Reich frontier .
We can only pray that the Allies
is faster than the Russians.
- You are not alone in thinking so .
- I think everyone here agrees .
Not true, Dr. Speidel ?
Hitler is furious. He can not
draw conclusions or make decisions.
Just saying : "To the last man ,"
gives nothing , except a disaster.
The idea of ??an attack on Cherbourg
is pure idiocy .
You 're the only ELIGIBLE Germany .
To end the war .
- There are others who are for war.
- Then it is they who must be shot .
If it is not possible otherwise .
Good God, Speidel .
You 're a true warrior .
- the enemy has devastated
large parts of the city ...
On the odd factories and bases
fluttering banner of resistance yet .
yet waged hot , bloody battles
on city streets.
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
From General von Schlieben :
" The final battle of Cherbourg . "
" We attacked with tanks.
Where is fly in aid? "
" Flight Over The aid can not
penetrate hostile roadblocks . "
" The Fuhrer's orders , you shall fight
to the last bullet . May God be with you. "
Fuhrer's orders were to the last man .
Should you really undermine it?
- Male or bullet, what is the difference?
- Kula means surrender, not dead.
I hope that the general interpretation of the
just like that.
Armed Forces in Cherbourg entered
in the German hero story ,
- which had been bricked in , and defended
through portholes .
They did run out of their last bullets
and then blew themselves up in the air.
- Are you sure? He travels to Germany?
- Yes.
He was directed to Obersalzberg .
How can you be so well informed ,
Duchess ?
I take care of my job. Did you shoot yours.
Do you really want me to do this ?
Thank you.
You do realize headquarters seeking
a scapegoat for Cherbourg case?
- You or me.
- I declare that the war should end .
- The whole world is clearly against us.
- What would you have me do?
- That you do not remain silent . Stay with me.
- You are right .
We sacrifice both of us.
He will give way again .
Just wait .
Obersalzberg
It's six o'clock . They let us wait.
Are you here von Kluge ? How nice that you
recovered you so quickly after the accident.
Thank you. Führer asked me to assess
the situation in the East.
Excuse me,
but my plane to Berlin waiting.
Make your statement .
My Führer , I'm here
as commander of Army Group B.
It's probably the last chance I have -
- To describe the situation on the western front
for those of you who are responsible for the people.
- I'll start with the political situation .
- You manifest your only in military affairs.
My responsibility towards Germany
forcing me into it .
I did not ask for your personal opinion
about world politics.
Please adhere solely to the purely military .
You know how disappointed I am
that you did not manage -
- To attack the Cotentin Peninsula .
Cherbourg had not had to fall.
The side with the best maintenance roads
always win battles .
Montgomery maintenance pathways
was more vulnerable than yours.
But the advantage you lost
because you were so hesitant .
Now we have to lock the British in Caen,
implement a counterattack -
- And let the enemy bleed to death in Normandy.
National Secretary ,
you get the generals' reports .
Question Hauser or Dietrich .
They know how hopeless the situation is.
Mein Führer , I can not go from here
without having talked about Germany with you.
Can we talk privately ?
It's probably best that you leave the room.
Should we stay at your house in Mr Lingen ?
... where we are . And we do not give
after an inch without a fight.
And if we do that ,
we turn back now!
We are so happy
we know since yesterday
General Field Marshal ? Should we stay
at your home in Mr Lingen ?
I see you again?
Take care of your mother, Manfred.
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
- Well, Speidel ?
- The front remains.
For a while , yes.
I am under no illusions, Speidel .
- Next time it will be me.
- Rundstedt , then?
Just as weak as ever.
He'll follow orders ,
regardless of how they are corked .
- All the facts are clear .
- Hitler did not care. He doubt ...
... the enemy's superiority in the air
and devastating sjöartilleri -
- As well as our maintenance problems .
He does not believe us ,
but we should believe him.
I simply say : " V -1".
Field Marshal ...
Leave your command .
It will take effect in the people.
- You're still our most popular soldier.
- Those at the top do not allow it .
They expect probably that I
'll die a heroic death ... at the front.
But I can help a little .
My family is prepared for it.
You must take care of him. He is
soldier dog. He will never be more civil .
It is certainly the .
Rommel . Yes ?
I see.
Thank you for informing me .
Rundstedt receive the Knight's Cross
and leave office .
And you?
- I remain.
- As Rundstedts substitute?
No, Field Marshal Kluge
becomes the new commander in chief in the West.
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
- How are you, Speidel ?
- Good . And you?
The British attack with great force.
It takes great manpower to hold out .
We need them in Saint -Lô, to
prevent Americans breakthrough.
We abandon neither Caen
or bridgehead .
We do not give an inch without a fight.
Führer's orders are clear.
Fuhrer not aware mode .
The order to hold out is devastating.
From now , you are getting , and everyone else,
get used to execute orders.
- What do you mean?
- You tend to ignore your superiors ...
... and run to the Führer instead.
Gentlemen, leave me alone
with Field Marshal awhile.
You have apparently forgotten
I am Field Marshal .
I want reports
from all masters on the front.
And statistics on the enemy naval
range artillery and ammunition.
Go to the front! Then you can see for yourself
the hostile sjöartilleriets force.
It is noticeable
you most have led a division .
And you have not fought
against the British.
Heavy weapons , armor
and artillery stationed -
- Beyond the hostile sjöartilleriets
range.
Artillery at Cagny and Émiéville .
And behind those tanks.
To keep the enemy occupied.
- How long ?
- In the best case , three weeks.
Until they break through.
So we have three weeks.
- For what?
- To find other solutions.
- Field Marshal .
- What ? I'm dead tired .
Do you remember Colonel von Hofacker ?
In Stülpnagels staff .
- He wants to talk to you. Tomorrow .
- About what?
I am here on my cousin's behalf;
Count von Stauffenberg .
You might know that he now
manage the reserve army ?
Yes. Has he recovered
from their injuries ?
As much as possible , yes.
He wants your assessment
the war situation in the West.
It should also reserve army know.
How long ?
Three weeks. Max six .
Unless miracles happen .
Do you think that the war is lost?
What you really want me ?
- Will you stand to Germany's favor?
- I do.
Another Germany.
With another government.
Put your hands .
- Halt! Stay there .
- Put your hands up ! Do not move .

- This you will regret.
Rommel HEADQUARTERS ,
Now that the Führer is dead, we must
make decisions. What will you do ?
Settle down , gentlemen.
My lords ,
We have received conflicting information .
Half an hour ago I spoke
the phone with General Stief .
He is currently at Mamry -
- And have talked to some officers
who left the Wolf's Lair today.
They say
Hitler survived the bomb attack .
What takes place in Berlin
is not conclusive.
The decisions made here in France
is very important.
For Germany's future sake, abandon
Hitler and suffered the liberation of the West.
Make the Field Marshal Rommel had
done - put an end to the bloody murders.
Do not end even worse. Prevent
German history's worst disaster.
Yes ? Just a moment .
General Warlimont ,

The Kluge .

- Are we ready?
What ? !
The entire security
and group Führer Oberg be arrested .
Or have already been arrested.
On Stülpnagels orders.
He did it without consulting any
or inform their commander in chief.
It's arbitrary conduct
unprecedented !
Refer to
that the order is immediately withdrawn .
The facts speak for themselves.
Your word and your honor is in danger.
Army's honor and the fate of millions
is in your hands .
Well ... if the pig had died , so ...
If I were you ,
I would try to escape as civilian.

Thank you for coming , sir.
But everything is already settled.
I take full responsibility
for revolt here in Paris.
Just Stülpnagel and I was initiated.
All the others were unaware .
I apologize .
But I have no regrets .
Names mentioned . Even yours.
It is enough if one call
you had with Hofacker July 9.
I do not remember .
It may not be incriminating .
You were asked about your assessment
of state ... and you gave an honest answer .
How does it look on the front?
s 3rd Army broke through

I do not want to be in your shoes .
Heil, mein Führer .

August 17, 1944
- Go ahead.
- A private letter to you from the Führer.
You are asked to come to Berlin
and report .
To report ?
The Americans have already crossed the Seine
with two divisions.
Yes, Speidel ...
That's all for me.
- Nice to meet you , Colonel. How are you?
- Thank you good.
I must speak to you in private.
Go in and tell your mom
we have guests.
- What gives?
- Field Marshal Kluge 's death.
He was called to Berlin, but took poison.
General Speidel considered
you ought to know that.
Yes. Thank you.
Do we know why?
We assume that Hitler gave him the debt
for frontal collapse.
All flees from us , Field Marshal .
Are not you ashamed , you wretch -
- Over to you , in the most miserable manner ,
betrayed the Führer ?
I regret only
I did not perform the attack .
- Then it had not failed.
- It was ... Corresponding ?
Be quiet , Mr. Freissler .
Today, it is my head.
In a year , it applies your head .
- What it was based on ?
- Nothing at all . It came totally unexpected.
I will await further orders
in Germany .
- Who will replace you in the army group?
- General Krebs .
Although Blumentritt replaced
and shall report in Berlin.
There is nothing unusual , Speidel .
They are looking for scapegoats
for the fiasco on the front.
The conspirators from Paris
sentenced a week ago .
Horrible . Even Stülpnagel .
Hofacker has apparently not
been executed yet.
- They might still need him.
- Do you have anything to fear ?
FREUDENSTADT
September 7, 1944
Good morning, Frau Speidel .
Is your husband at home?
SECURITY MINISTRY IN BERLIN
September 20, 1944
- Good morning , General.
- Colonel .
He is not anymore.
Herr von Hofacker has just
its weak life left .
Well, Herr von Hofacker .
Tell Dr. Speidel
what you have told us.
That you 've talked to him
on attack plans.
And that even Field Marshal Rommel
was informed about them.
No. Neither marshal or
Lieutenant-General was informed.
If I 've said it ...
... I must have been ...
temporary memory confused.
Mr Lingen, October 1.
Dear Frau Speidel .
Your husband's fate touches me deeply.
Especially since you have not heard anything
from him for over three weeks ...
... worries me a lot.
I put a high value on your make-
- As excellent, skilled
and ambitious chief of staff.
I'll write to the Führer today
and put in a good word for him.
" Mein Führer , you know I put down
all the power and ability " -
- "In the Battle of France in 1940,
in Africa 1941-1943 " -
- 'In Italy in 1943
and on the western front in 1944. "
" My only goal is to fight for
and win for your new Germany. "
" Heil, mein Führer .
E point Rommel . "
Maybe he was informed, yes .
- But he did not participate actively .
- Knowledge is betrayal .
According to Lieutenant General Speidel
he -
- Via Hofacker ,
posted by General von Stülpnagel -
- Knowledge of the plan
the attack 20 July 1944 .
He informed
Field Marshal Rommel .
To Rommel did not keep information
Furthermore , he did not know .
I believe General Lieutenant's apology
be unlikely.
It was his duty to self- report
the attack plan.
Especially as Rommel must have said
that he did not intend to report.
The Führer is of the opinion
Speidels that debt can not be doubted.
Gentlemen .
If General Speidel claims -
- That he has informed Rommel
on the attack -
- The prosecution must disprove it .
This is a sophistry attempt
to acquit Dr Speidel .
And even then ...
The matter was so serious that Speidel not
should rely on marshal .
If there is anything a soldier
be able to rely on ...
so ... is it to his superiors
doing their duty .
I hope you realize
what this means for Rommel .
