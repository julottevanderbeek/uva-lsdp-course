On 6Th January 1917
Five soldiers condemned to death were lead to
the sector of Bullavent,
near the river of the Somme.
The first one
He has been a keen adventurer a long time ago
He wore on his neck the number 2124
He came from a recruitment center of La Seine
He was wearing boots
He took them from a German soldier.
Before The soldier 2124,
His name was Bastoche
was with a beautiful redhead girl
called Véronique Passavant.
He was carpenter in the " La Bastille"
Sometimes between two furnitures
They went to drink a beer
in the pub of Petit Louis
on the street "The Golden Hand"
He took the boots from an enemy
who didn't need them no more.
in order to replace them,
once filled up with straw and newspaper paper,
They remplaced his former boots.
he went in a military tribunal for voluntary
mutilation.
They had found rest of powder in the wound of his
hand, then he was condemned to death.
The second soldier was the number 4077
from another recruitment center of La Seine.
He worked on the Steel for the state railroads in
Manille.
His name was Francis Ganière, We called him "Six Soux"
He knew that the poor
were building the canons
which will kill them
and that the wealthy people sold them.
He tried to explain it during
the barrackings, but he didn't explain well.
In addition, the cheap wine : their friend in the
misery, made the soldiers so pissed,
that he didn't even know how
to interrupt them.
And the most dangerous one.
He once killed the officer of his team.
An officer who hit the dead.
Get up ! Get up !
You, go away !
No one knew it.
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer.
On one morning in the month of August,
they went to take him away from his farm.
and they forced him to go on the train.
Be aware of the cables !
The phone cables were
the only way to connect to the world of the living.
by that fine thread, they were hoping for
the grace of the president Raymond Poincare
to spare their life.
Even if the only one here beliefing in that was him...
Number 7328 recruited from
the island Corsica.
Ange Bassignano
According to all people who knew him,
no one ever had a name that unsuitable
'The Angel' was a liar, a cheater, a fake.
an informer and agitator.
Before, he has been the procurer  of Tina Lombardi
Because of her,
He has been condemned to jail for five year
for a honor or love business.
it depended on the fact if they
were a woman or a man.
Actually... it was a settle between
the procurers  of the village.
During the summer of 1916 they recruited
delinquents
in order to be able to replace losses within the
massacred regiments
in Berdun hell. It was up to them.
For whom are Those tombs ?
Well Actually... well... as tomorrow they are
going to attack...
So we anticipate.
Be aware of the cable.
The fifth soldier was a kid who belonged of the section of 17
He just needed 5 months to be 20 years old.
And now, he was afraid of everything.
of the French canons which were shotting so much.
of the wind that spread
the gas of the hunters of robbery, of the executions
Before the war he was not like this, he was all the
opposite...
He defied storms to help keeping lighthouses working
when the tide raised.
Charge !!
Then a detail will change everything.
There you go kid, you will return to see your
fiancee, you just got your way out.
yep, you got your way right to the court-martial
My sergeant, close your eyes for a change,
he already suffered enough, don't you think?
Sergeant they may condemn him to death
Be understanding for a change!
Shut your mouth!
Come on Sergeant..
Shut the fuck up !
When Mathilde and Manech made love for the
first time
Manech fell asleep with his hand left over her breast.
Whenever he felt his wound on his hand beating,
it was like feeling the
Mathilde heart beating
And each beat will make him closer to her.
If Manech were dead, Mathilde would know.
After the news of his death,
she desperately clung
to her intuition like a fine thread.
Still, she never gets discouraged.
Mathilde has a cheerful disposition.
she knows that if ever her thread
doesn't connect her to her lover
Well that's not too bad,
she still can hang herself up with.
In June of 1920
Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.
A sick man from the "Le Reim"
hospital wanted to meet her.
He was with Manech
in January 1917, on the front
of the Somme
In August 1912, he was a good
looking man, wasn't he ?
It is of lemon, with direct gear box.
please tell me what happened to Manech
In January 1917 they ordered me to
escort five
condemned men to the front.
Was He among them ?
Yeah.
I had to take them to the first line of
the trench.
Gendarmes waited for us with the prisoners next to
a small cemetery in ruins.
What the fuck are you doing with those German boots?
I am waiting.
Waiting for what ?
To be spared by Poincare?
You can dream on Dude !
He already signed it.
Normally I should not have been
condemned.
I am from Corsica, you know, not French!
Let him be. He loses a wee bit his head for
Lucky him.
Are you done my lieutenant?
That soldier, He doesn't have long time before
he dies, the cold will kill him.
What about Manech? ...Does his wound on his hand make
him suffer badly??
We had to amputate
his two fingers, but apparently he was
doing okay.
They took them to a trench called "the
bingo twilight".
Fucking hell. Could you not make sure to kick out of the
truck these useless people on your way ??
To kick their ass so as to come along faster?
My orders were to deliver you
the five condemned men, I don't care about
the rest.
Then I will tell them what are my orders...
to throw these guys to the trench
and to let them die like dogs between the two
firing lines.
Those are my fucking orders
Sergeant!
You understand Sergeant,
with the Germans we have a species in
tactical agreement.
The sector is wee bit sleepy, a kick in the
ass and all the shit will explode on our faces !
The soup guys, You are lucky it is warm.
And what would you like to get kiddo?
A chocolate cup and a piece of bread with honey.
Unless I have to kill my parents: I will get that to you.
Do you mind lieutenant?
Don't worry, he is an orphan,
but he will no doubt get you what
you want.
He is the chief of the kitchens.
Bread with salt, honey of lavagne and...
Cacao of Nigeria.
Happiness
There you go kid, do you have anyone to write to?
do you have a girlfriend?
Mathilde
His girlfriends's name is Mathilde.
Mathilde
I feel like her heart beats in me with Morse code.
We are about to get married.
They condemned us and We don't have to wait for the
end of war anymore.
I will go Home when the
execution is over.
Maybe it is better that I don't tell you the
end.
I am lame, not stupid
Tell me what happens.
We opened a breach in the wire fences
and we helped the five soldiers to fight against the cold.
Célestin Poux gave your boyfriend one of his red wool
gloves, so that the hand was protected.
Is it far away ??
Less than 100 meters. Far for the grenades and
close for the artillery.
And not to mention the gas.
Do you Think that they will be allright?
If They don't fly in the air,
they will very likely die of hunger and cold.
In any case the Germans will shut up for a while.
Bastoche the carpenter has been embraced
by a corporal.
It was obvious they knew each other before the war.
Soon... we took them outside the trench.
- Assholes.
- Shit!
- Shut up!
In September 1914, I could easily lift 70 Kilos
Moreover I was already not in great shape like
in the past.
But that morning, in january 1917
was Manech still alive?
At the dawn, Favart shout out their names.
All, except the farmer from Dordogne, responded.
- Bassignano?
- Present.
- Bouquette?
- what the hell do you want?
- Langonnet?
- Yeah, I am here.
Dude you should hide in a better spot.
Notre Dame? Notre Dame?
I know nothing else.
I retired to write my report
young lady.
At last Soldier, the English come to take our place,
we can go.
And the subject bingo?
What is that?
The list of the condemned signed by
Favourier captain
- Do I leave It there?
- Nope give it to me.
Don't stay there like an idiot,
what are you waiting for?
You are promoted sergeant first thing in the
morning and leave for the Bosbos.
Even so my commander, this mission is
going away to be stuck in my throat.
Good news, there are balsamic caramels for the
throat there.
The caramels of the Bosbos.
We are done.
Some months later, I have been
hurt in the Somme.
I found myself in the same ambulance as
Chardolot
one of the officials in "the bingo twilight".
But He just had few days to live.
Eh oh, It is me Esperanza.
Bingo twilight you remember?
Oh sorry I didn't recognize you.
Tell me, my no man's land boys...
How did the story finish ?
What do you think ?
No survivor ??
Do you feel remorse?
You should have stayed with us in Bingo.
I saw the capital Ms written down
... underpants, an albatross.
You are delirious. You got the flue.
We threw between two lines five boys alive,
then we recovered five cold meat.
so...
I lost my vision sergeant, but
I imagine your face.
That makes my day.
He really spoke of capital Ms and an albatross?
yep ... and of underpants.
There you go Young lady,
everything the condemned men
in Bingo ever possessed.
They asked me to send everything to their families.
My health didn't allow me to do it.
It is a copy of the letter of the farmer Benoît
Notre Dame to his wife.
I sent the original one to her when I left
Bingo.
His health is due to the gas in the lungs right?
Nope, it is because he got the spanish flue.
You can notice, the death is lurking and catches
us totally by surprise.
Mathilde You don't have to be pissed off,
you can talk to me,
If you can't talk, just stay quiet.
But sometimes when we start speaking, it's
when we start crying.
and when crying
we talk about what you didn't want to
you know what I mean.
I will not have to bear anymore that silly face
Petit Louis tell to Vero
that I will always think about her
and that it is too bad she doesn't want to
talk to me, I met again Biscotte
and we made up. Good bye
my friend. Bastoche
Benoît Notre Dame Numero 1818
I will not be able to write again
for a while.
Tell Berney I will pay everything by the month of Mars.
he sells his installment too expensive
You have to be careful.
tell my Bagtistan that I hope nothing bad will happen to him
I have never known such a nice person.
I love you. Benoît
For Tina Lombardi from Ange Bassignano.
If The dog enters the room before they call me
for the dinner, Manech must be still alive.
I am not hungry.
The dinner is ready.
Come Malthide, let's go to eat.
I'm coming.
Mathilde was born on the first of January 1900
That's very easy to determinate one's age.
In 1903 hers parents passed away in the accident
of the bus 44.
Since then Mathilde kept telling
Late parents... late parents...
Her uncle Sylvain and her aunt Bénédicte
took care of her,
thanks to the life insurance managed by the
lawyer of her parents; Pierre Marie Rouvières.
At five years old, Mathilde caught the polio virus.
She stayed several months in the bed in spite of
the mustard cataplasms,
the pendulums,
and the infusions of shamrock with four leaves.
Today Mathilde is 20 years old, she plays tuba,
because it is the only instrument that seems to
give the distress signal.
The dog always farts when it sleeps
Whenever Bénédicte hears the dog, she says
The farty dog betrayed.
Mathilde needs to get daily massages for
her legs.
Georges Cornu the champion of Britain in free
style swimming gives her massage.
At the beginning she was anxious.
but she got used to it.
When Mathilde was in the mood, she imagined that
Georges Cornu admired the shape of her body.
and he couldn't repress his desire.
As a matter of fact, one day he dared to remark :
You have very beautiful curves young lady,
and I can assure you that I have touched lot of women.
So Mathilde didn't know anymore
if she could call him :
My dear Gorge...
My loved Gorge...
Gogo
Sometimes, before sleeping she imagined herself in
hot situations
Mathilde never had to use
all her imagination to succumb to the pleasure.
But since he disappeared, she cannot think
about her fiance when she seeks pleasure.
If I was you I would forget everything Mathilde, it is of no use to
look for nothing,
Moreover if he were alive why did he not give any sign huh?
Because he had been made a prisoner
He stayed with a german girl
with two blond tresses with big tits.
A Breton eating sauerkraut every single day. ..impossible.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you??
Oh no but I prefer you to keep your feet on the ground.
Well I will need to feel my legs for that!
What did you say??
Nothing
I did hear you.
what you just said doesnt make any sense.
Manech cannot be a prisoner in Bingo, because
It is where we find the enemy lines.
Generally winners can take the prisoners.
Maybe he lost his direction, or he hides somewhere
so as not to go to jail
My sweet Mathilde you read
too many novels.
You have to go back to reality.
You are young and beautiful,
you could easily find a husband
in spite of....
In all that story there is something
that does not add up.
I must find back
the plunderer of kitchens... Célestin Poux
What would you want kiddo?
Or maybe the prostitute from Corsica, maybe
she knows things more I do.
Tomorrow I go away to Paris.
what ?
What's for??
To look for a survivor of Bingo twilight.
... I have archives all the way up to the ceiling,
You can't imagine the number
of cases which never saw the day.
if Germain Pire did not come in hand.
Have a look at this,
A big case, an extremely delicate one. In 1917 a train
with soldiers derails
thanks to the investigation we discovered that
the official
gave the order to leave although the brakes
did not work.
It was a concealment maneuver
from the government of Poincare
The only option for the victim families
to find back
the official... Germain Pire.
The spy that chirps.
Oh way worse, young lady. And I found the official
For the sorrow of the high military spheres.
Allright, in the cemetery of Craon.
As soon as I made my suitcases I left go after them,
Poux Célestin and his lover from Corsica.
And what about the fees ?
Look my lady, The spy that chirps
knows to whom he should pluck.
For you It would be 20 francs per day
Without the expenses of course.
And why would you do me that favour?
Hélène come on to say hello !
About the expenses of Germain Pire Don't worry
He eats little, does not drink
and he is very sparing in gratuities.
- Good morning
- Good morning
Notre Dame de Paris?
no, not Notre Dame de Paris, I call you from
Paris about Notre Dame, Benoît
Ah Benoît Notre Dame yes, a strong farmer and of
great heart.
He died for the mother country, we say that the
mother country has cleared me of good people.
His wife and her small Bagtistan
still live there?
Madame Minne I can't hear nothing!
No, a day she sold everything and they went
away without leaving direction.
is it a choir that I hear behind your back?
it's a choir indeed dear lady, I am in the church.
However that is not an excuse
for not hearing you well.
- Thanks Father, Good bye.
- welcome.
Bingo twilight.
That does not have feet nor head. this is a scandal.
I thought that your vocation was to defend lost
causes.
when you were 10 years old your Your insolence had grace,
not when you are 20 years old.
As a matter of fact, it would be
time to take me seriously.
Mathilde, Mathilde, you squander your inheritance
in an absurd chimera.
Bingo twilight, and why not Yupi Tralalala...
I want to consult military files.
Mathilde let's say
there were any truth in there
and if one of the condemned
men ever survived he would face
forced works. And you know it!
Your investigations would cause him
very dangerous problems.
Be sensible, they trusted the interests to me...
... your parents
Late parents
Actually, my happiness was one of their interests.
Good bye, and thanks.
My sweet Mathilde
do not be like that please.
I think about your future,
it hurts me much to see you got
worse despise your massages.
All right all right I will see
what I can do.
I can't put that though in Lourdes..
Good morning lady I look for Tina
Lombardi I know her since she was a kid and..
Pardon ladies I am a political uncle of Tina
Lombardi and I would like to erm....
Please, I am in charge of the interests of the
Lombardi family in the continent,
and I look for Tina. It is about a small heritage...
Are you the man who is looking for Tina
Lombardi?
No, in fact no
Don't you know Corsica ? It is very pretty place
very colorful.
But Tina
Lombardi went away after
bad business
Luckily a member of the police
found her whereabouts in the bar leville.
Valentin Emilia Maria Lombardi, called tina,
has been registered
in 1916 near the quarter of regiment 23 of
Marseilles.
After that she flew away.
I lost her tracks in Lyon, and trust me I didn't
stop working.
She has disappeared in the
district of the Croix Rousse.
What you mean is you give up
Not at all, Pire never lets it go.
Pire is obstinate, a detective who gives up,
he doesn't exist young lady.
Perfect, thanks.
Not the eyes, no
What do you drink ?
This is my fiance, and there it is the
carpenter
I believe that you know him.
No. I am suddenly thirsty, do you mind a wine
glass?
It gives force and it cheers the way.
My great aunt told me the same thing.
she died in Besançon in 1911 at the age of 99 years old.
and she had never been ill.
Good luck.
I touch wood.
The war.
No, a hyena in the botanical garden
I wanted to stroke it to be a smart ass.
Bastoche and his friend did this for me.
Biscotte?
His best friend. They met in 1910
by saving a woman from drowning in the flood.
Bastoche was skillful, but Biscotte...
He was an artist, the king of firmer chisel.
He did all the joints.
It is a wonder!
It is for you.
Petit Louis tell to Vero
that I will always think about her
and that it is too bad she doesn't want to
talk to me, I met again Biscotte
and we made up. Good bye
my friend.
Bastoche
If they made up, they must have had a fall out.
Do you know the reason ?
A mystery.
But to tell you the truth, they went through so much together,
And out of the blue, they can't bear each other.
Biscotte went away to another army.
and he died in the bombing of one
military hospital where he was injured.
Anyway, I am glad they made up before.
It seems that it will not be
very busy here today.
Do you serve a drink?
It seems you are again thirsty huh?
Maybe he has a wooden hand
but he still has a big heart.
Let's drink to love. The true one!
Do you know who is that Véro?
Véronique Passavant. His girlfriend, his lover.
He often came here with her.
What could have happened as
she didn't want to talk to him anymore ?
I suppose he has been unfaithful
and she never forgave him.
Voila, here is the place for the year 1917.
what are the red files about ??
Top Secret Defense
We need higher clearance for them.
This way please,
upstairs.
Go to help him
Oh right.
Suppose that the highest person is yourself
... then Mr. Rouvières and I would have
clearance right ?
If I had that kind of mind
I would not be an Official.
Mathilde please consider yourself lucky
to have been able to come here.
Normally it usually takes months.
Like I told you, they say everything is in order
but actually it is totally a chaos
To see... in front of the Somme
Sector of Bullavent, trench 108.
You know what I mean. This is a chaos!
It is a real mess.
Can I help you?
I thank you for the management
... with the General, I say.
Good, he is a great friend mine.
I know the sector very well  two
friends of mine died there.
Then it has been a very bloody war...
I don't think that things will get better
It is very difficult to find a maid nowadays.
It seems like a lie.
We would like to know that passage in trench 108.
... 104, trench 105, 107, where is the 106 one ??
See? A mess.
Trench 108... this is a bloody mess.
Good 108, here these...
... Taken by us in October of 1916
and renamed Bingo twilight.
And why not trooi Tralala?
on 6 January there is nothing
on 7 january great confrontation with numerous losses...
Favourier captain, the professor of history die
in combat...
The lieutenant... An adviser of insurances!
The caporal.... Good that but it gives...
That is weird, a part of the losses are classified confidential.
Confidential? It means...
I am sorry
And we can do nothing about it?
No nothing
Up to here we can arrive.
I am sorry
Not even the general himself could do
nothing about it
Even so, I thank you for your time
I am sorry, there is nothing which can be of any interest for you.
really ordinary files.
It was one possibility.
everything is a chaos!
you are incorrigible Mathilde...!
... no lady, that is totally impossible
no, without the seal of the ministry it is
impossible.
I hope that this leaf is not secret of defense.
Pierre Marie, if it is important You must tell me.
nope that is nothing. only one permission.
Of the president ?
So what, every so often the president can give
it to the soldiers but who deserve it.
That is it.
I take both of you out
Corporal Bouquette Clevert, Ganière Francis
Soldier Notre Dame Benoît, soldier Bassignano
Ange
Soldier Langonnet Manech
By voluntary mutilation the sentence to capital
punishment.
I count up to 7 and if the train doesn't enter a tunnel
Or the conductor does not come. Manech is dead
One, two, three,
four, five, six
Tickets please.
April fool !
As soon as you finish eating your meal, we will
pay your announcement.
It compensates all information referring to
Bingo twilight. is that okay for you??
Yes, try to encourage her, it would
give her appetite.
you would have taken her to the
camperre festival.
What for?
To  distract you a wee bit.
Not to mention you
could find a nice boyfriend.
But what's for ??
So you can marry and raise a family !
Tell her !
Can I have some too?
Do you drink wine now?
A wine glass gives force and cheers the way.
Where did you get that from ??
On the street "the gold hand", the owner of the
bar, with his died hand, He has a wooden hand,
His great aunt said that before
dying, at the age of 99 years old
in Besançon in 1911.
Can you say that again?
In Besançon, in 1911
... one old lady lived until 99 years, who died leaving
behind a little nephew who has a wood hand
He is the owner of the died hand,
a bar on the street  the gold hand.
You see it? Already pissed off.
Look !
This is the Albatros.
It knows that it can use the wind at will.
Oh my gravel! my gravel!
Véronique Passavant on July 17th 1920
Lady, I write you from the bar of Petit Louis who
told me about you.
I have to tell about about a meeting I have had
which gave me a fright.
I was coming to the factory of Bastoche because
I was melancholic.
I would like to speak with Bastoche
Bastoche but he died...
... in the front of the Somme, you didn't know?
But I am looking for something else.
What exactly??
In the hospital where I help the patients, there
are terminal syphilitics.
One of them has given this to me for you.
if you don't want to die covered by
purulent abscesses, you would do better
answering me !
The companion with whom Bastoche hides
Tell me, tell me who is he?
Well well I would not let myself be upset by
some young lady
Tina Lombardi knows something we don't
What did you say??
Tina Lombardi knows something which
eludes us.
Something that would prove
that Bastoche is still alive.
And the other condemned men.
it is obvious she believes I am his angels.
But if Bastoche has been saved, Then I am sure
that he protected Manech.
If he ever survived it is.
Wait.
It can, but if not outside for that reason,
single I would have left to hang to me.
Are you winding me up you smart ass ?
Whenever you come here I must fix
the gravel.
As for the gravel, it is a question about style.
A letter for the young lady.
Ironworks R. Leprince, Paris 1920 July 25.
Young lady, I take advantage of Sunday today to
write to you with respect to your announcement
where it says that you are looking
for Célestin Poux and
other survivors
of Bingo twilight.
I knew that guy very well,
he was the best go-getter that
I ever met.
Thanks to him
I never starved myself.
Olivier Nergeton mechanical
toys manufacturer.
Célestin Poux was our provider, we called
the terror of the kitchens
He falsified the numbers of losses, so as to multiply
the money in order to get the soldiers more foods.
If you ever meet him, Tell him that the veterans
of Fontenau will never forget him.
Etienne Mauriaux, Professor, August 3 of 1920
He made us laugh ours heads off,
to get us food, he would even
tame the mascot of the company.
Good morning Madam, Germain Pire private
detective.
Oh yeah, Mathilde told us about you.
Sylvain Tell Mathilde to go downstairs,
the detective wants to see her.
The great Pire moves like hell, he can spend a
day in each site.
In any case we will need luck and patience to
get him.
A shame.
Mathilde I got you some salty cakes.
You will see if you like them.
You won't be better in the kitchen?
Thank you Bénédicte.
Allright, I leave you alone.
Poux is a mystery, whereas Tina Lombardi
that is another story
She misleads us with dead end leads.
And to make matters
worse she changes identities.
Anything new about Biscotte ?
Wait !
Look at this, this is Benjamín Gordes
it is the day where they got the carpentry
prize,
for sixth consecutive year.
But!
And yes, young lady.
Biscotte, the best friend of Bastoche, is no
one else but Benjamín Gordes
and a soldier of the company told me
that they were close-knit before
they fought.
Leave me alone.
I do not want to fight with you.
Leave me alone.
Calm down!
Bastard, Asshole .
Who got that idea ??
Me??
It was your idea.
It was just for a skirt matter.
Véronique Passavant broke up with
Bastoche in June 1916
and immediately afterwards, Bastoche fight with
Benjamín Gordes.
You don't have to be a lynx for that huh?
So they didn't see each other till
in Bingo twilight?
Bingo twilight is where
everything finishes.
No, it is where everything started, Mr. Pire
Where everything starts.
Tina Lombardi is sure Bastoche
is still alive.
What made Bastoche different from the
others in Bingo twilight?
That he was the only carpenter, no?
There is a thing that differentiates Bastoche
from the others...
... the German boots.
He was the only one to
wear German boots!
But of course !
You are right !
Tina Lombardi just knew that her man
by wearing German boots
he could have got away with it.
It would suffice that they
had seen him with some companion.
I met two Frenchmen
they looked like  tramp
... One of them got boots.
He got them from a german soldier
In addition to the german boots, we know that Bastoche
made up with his best friend.
Exactly! who knows if it doesn't
make any change during that night.
If I can peel that apple without breaking
the skin then
Gordes found a way to help out
and save Bastoche,
and Manech.
At that rate I won't put the cake in the oven
before the next year !
I must return to Paris
What ??
I have to return to Paris.
Again? The inheritance
of your parents will go away like smoke.
Late parents.
Excuse me,
where is Elodie Gordes?
That's the woman with the carrots.
Ah, thanks Sir.
Elodie Gordes?
Here for you.
I do not know him.
Which person don't you know??
Would it be that one by any chance?
Because Bastoche and
Biscotte had a fall out?
Was it because
of you??
You exagerate,
I do not have anything
to tell him.
No, I just need to know.
Leave me alone!
They saw each other for the
very last time in the
bingo twilight
My fiance was there too with Bastoche
in that excrement trench.
I need to understand.
I need to understand!
It is not what you think.
I can tell you everything.
Give me your address,
although I have misspelling,
I will put everything in a letter.
I promise you.
No letter for me ?
What did you say ?
There is no letter for me ?
Only the newspaper...
It talks about the all world but
not about Elodie Gordes.
Very funny.
You are wrong.
You can learn a lot of interresting things.
The president has opened an investigation on
the condemned men of Bingo twilight?
A man fell out of the train in the middle of the night
and in pajamas
At least him, he sleeps with pajamas.
Eh?
He sleeps with pyjamas!
... and we recovered five cold cuts
You are already a thief, and now
you are pyromaniac.
- Did you hurt yourself ??
- No I am fine.
For a change I don't have to gather the gravel, but
to collect the mailman.
You took away the gravel!
A good war!
There is no good war.
Do you want to drink something?
Yes please.
Miss, please keep secret my little secrets
When I met my husband,
he had four children from
a first marriage.
No one kid was his.
By generosity he married with a
young tuberculosa widow
of Polish nationality, like me.
He considered the children as his
before she died.
Myself,I was unmarried mother
of a girl of 3 years.
So we found ourself with a family
with 5 children,
We had four years of happiness.
We had many plans. We dreamed to be able to
see the sea once in life.
But then the war started.
At first I thought that his Bastoche friend would
take care of him because they were together,
but when he came back for the first time, in
September of 1915
Right after the campaign of Artois,
I understood right away nothing would
be like before.
This gives us the force to get on in life.
A day in a battlefield in flames I saw my
companions
exploding like if they
were firecrackers.
One time we even used the body
of a companion,
to make of him a shield.
He had been thinking about something
for a long time
it was in the second night that it started
You will understand that if I desert
they will arrest me
The only way of getting away is to have
a sixth child.
When we have 6 children, they send
the soldiers back home.
As I already told him, He can't have children.
I could not imagine what to think.
But voila, he brought up again the subject.
But it is me who asks you, Elodie, that is not
adultery.
And even less
if it is with Bastoche.
Don't touch !
No of the five children is mine,
who cares about another one??
Although it embarrasses me,
we would have wait 9 months
... by then the war would already be over.
But no It will never be over!
Those nine months will represent
a hope for me.
Don't you have more compassion??
Then some day I found
a letter of Clevert Bouquette,
AKA Bastoche in the letterbox.
I put something colorful at the window
so he knows where to show up.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I made some coffee, do you want one?
- Oh yes it would be nice thank you.
- Come in
- No, You first.
Thank you very much.
-  Do you want sugar ?
- No, thanks.
- It is of nacre?
-  yes Benjamín made it.
- It is curious we never met
- Yes, before.
Are the children not home?
Yes, they are playing in the backyard.
- A digestive with the coffee ?
- Yes please.
In fact not... I am sorry.
I don't need it
I don't need it too.
Elodie look, we tell him we did it.
So we are on peace for a while.
That is for the best.
For you, for me, for everybody.
It is funny, when you smile it looks like
a bracket.
It will close but the possible thing late.
The day after tomorrow, in the station.
Time to go, a very last smile okay?
In order to close the bracket.
I never have been pregnant.
But soon after, it was not the fear
which were tormenting my husband,
but the jealousy.
Where? When? Whichever times?
In which positions? Did you enjoy yourself?
It became an utter torture for him and me.
Now Bastoche died...
And my husband died in the hospital bombing.
It made me good to be honest with
you Miss.
Sometimes I am scared to become crazy.
Elodie Gordes.
Mathilde hurry up, This Mr. Rouvières on
the phone waiting for you.
Move, Move.
- Hello.
- Mathilde, It's me Pierre Marie.
Erm, I have bad news for you,
Good or bad news, You were expecting for them,
... and that from now on, you will not be able to
continue ignoring.
The bottom line is, you
were right about one thing
Manech and his 4 companions
were indeed in that trench.
