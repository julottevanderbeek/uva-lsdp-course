Let's just keep it quiet, ma'am.
You speak English?
Yes.
Are there any Japs around?
You're...
You're an American.
Have the Americans...
No, no, no.
No, just me.
Just me, you understand?
Are there any Japs on the island?
No.
You're sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
All right, where are
the rest of you?
The rest?
Isn't there anybody
else on this island?
There is no one else here.
What, ma'am?
There is no one on
the island but me.
You're, uh...
You're alone here?
God has been with me.
You're, uh...
You're a nun, ain't you, ma'am?
Yes, I'm...
I'm sister Angela.
Oh.
I'd better transfer out
of the sun, ma'am.
In here okay?
Yes.
Everything's pitching like I'm...
still on the raft.
I'd better lie down
before I fall down.
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm...
I'm real beat.
You, ma'am. You...
You okay?
Yes. Yes.
I'm in no danger of any kind.
- Have no fear.
- Right.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
What gives, ma'am? We're
supposed to have a blackout.
If there were Japanese out there,
they could see those lights
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yes, I'm sorry, Mr....
Allison. Corporal
Allison, U.S. Marines.
Where am I, ma'am?
This, uh...
This island got a name?
- Yes, uh, Tuasiva.
- An atoll, huh?
Yes.
Listen, did I hear right?
You're, uh...
You're all alone on this island?
Yes.
Since when?
Mr. Allison, you
must be very hungry.
I'll tell you what happened
after you've eaten.
There's some dried fruit and some
biscuits over in the bungalow.
I'll go for that.
How about seconds, ma'am?
There isn't anymore.
Why didn't you say so?
Fine guy that makes me,
taking food out of a woman's mouth,
especially a nun's.
You were starved, Mr. Allison.
I don't suppose there'd be
any cigarettes around, huh?
No.
No cigarettes.
What I wouldn't do for a smoke.
Who belongs to this?
It was Father Phillips' pipe.
He's buried down there.
How'd he die, ma'am?
The last few days were
too much for him.
I was at the mission at Wanitok.
That's in the Tua group.
The Japanese were raiding
islands all around us...
and conscripting the natives...
and making prisoners
of the Europeans.
A ship came for us.
Our instructions were to close
the mission and go to Fiji,
but Father Phillips wouldn't
leave without Father John Ryan,
who was alone here at Tuasiva.
It was against the ship's
orders to come for us,
so Father Phillips prevailed
upon some natives...
to bring us in a sailing craft.
It required all his
eloquence and money.
The crew was in terror
of the Japanese.
But why'd you come here, ma'am?
I mean, why didn't you go
to Fiji with the others?
Father Phillips was over 70...
Too old to make the voyage alone.
We landed here four days ago.
Father Ryan wasn't here.
No one was here.
The Japanese had come before us.
Go on, ma'am.
Father Phillips went all about
the island calling Father Ryan.
"John! John!"
We climbed up the hill,
and when we got to the top,
we saw our boat sailing off.
Poor souls. They had
simply lost courage.
Father Phillips said,
"God forgive them."
Nothing more.
Then we...
came back down the hill...
and sat here on the verandah.
He smoked his pipe...
and it grew dark.
I went inside and slept.
Next morning I found
him on the beach.
He had fallen.
He couldn't talk.
I gave him his crucifix.
He kissed it,
and he died.
That's tough, ma'am.
On you, I mean.
Why, I'm sure it's nothing...
to what you have been
through, Mr. Allison.
We was on a sub,
lying off some island
with a code name.
My party was supposed to
go ashore and do a recon.
We had the rafts over the side already.
We was just getting in them...
What I mean, we was
half on, half off.
Suddenly a light hits us.
Twenty-millimeter stuff
started pouring in.
So the skipper takes the sub down,
which is according to his book,
but a little tough on us gyrenes.
We're crawling around
there in the water,
and suddenly the Jap boat
starts dropping depth charges.
It's like the whole
ocean is exploding.
Something bumps into me.
A raft, empty.
So, I pull myself onto
it, heave my guts up...
Begging your pardon, ma'am.
Next thing I know, it's daylight.
There's no land in sight.
Guess that's about
it, till I hit here.
Thank God you were
spared, Mr. Allison.
Same goes for you, ma'am.
Well, I...
think I'll get a little rest now.
You'll be all right
here on the verandah?
- Oh, sure. Sure, ma'am.
- Good night, Mr. Allison.
Good night, ma'am.
That should do us, Mr. Allison.
I seen some bamboo over there.
I'm gonna go cut me a spear...
and spear some fish.
Look at the turtle,
Mr. Allison, sunning himself.
Why, it sure is, ma'am.
Come on, ma'am!
Hubba-hubba!
Come on!
Ah!
I seen a length of rope over
there by that shed. Go get it.
- We're gonna catch that turtle, ma'am.
- Are we, Mr. Allison?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
your help. Come on.
All right, now, ma'am, together.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
Hup. Ho.
Three. Four.
One. Two. Three.
- Four.
- That's the stuff. One.
Two. Three. Four.
Oh! One. Two.
Three. Four.
There he is, ma'am. Dead ahead.
Easy now.
Just let her drift.
Got him.
Just like taking candy from a baby.
Oh!
Oh, Mr. Allison!
Oh!
Ooh, my. Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Ma'am!
Turtle meat's kind of sticky, huh?
- But it's good.
- Mmm! It's delicious.
What is turtle anyway?
It ain't a fish.
It's, uh, it's a reptile.
- You mean like snake?
- Well, of the same family.
It's considered a great delicacy.
It's a gourmet's dish.
No kidding.
Whose dish?
A person who knows fine food.
Oh.
You know, with all the things there
are to eat on this island...
There's breadfruit,
mangoes, papaya,
not to mention the
fish in the sea...
There's no question
about us surviving.
We could go on here for years,
and I mean years.
You think it might come
to that, Mr. Allison?
Well, the way this war is going.
Well, isn't there any chance of
our own forces landing here?
Well, the brass planned to
bypass a lot of these islands...
on their way to Tokyo.
At least, that's the scuttlebutt.
Scuttle what?
Scuttlebutt. You know, the poop.
Poop.
Like, um, guys beating their gums,
you know, giving out
with the rumors.
Oh, yes, of course, rumors.
Well, they don't seem to beat
their gums on very hopeful poop,
do they, Mr. Allison?
No, ma'am, they don't.
How far do you figure
it is to Fiji, ma'am?
About 300 miles,
Father Phillips said.
Lots of water.
Due south, ain't they?
I believe so.
That's the way the wind's blowing.
Why, Mr. Allison?
Why, Mr. Allison?
Well, I was thinking...
but, no, ma'am, that would
be just plain crazy.
What would?
Trying to sail down
there in a raft.
Everything would be against
our making it, everything,
even if there weren't
Japs all around...
and we could sneak through them.
What I mean is that nobody
in their right minds...
would want to leave this place...
where's there's plenty
to eat and good water...
and go sailing off
to hell and gone...
begging your pardon, ma'am...
in a two-by-four rubber raft, and maybe
starve to death or die of thirst,
even if they didn't get drowned.
But you'd like to try.
Is that it, Mr. Allison?
Well, ma'am...
Of course you would.
No, if it was just me, okay,
but, uh, I couldn't ask you to go,
and I wouldn't leave you here,
so, uh, let's forget all about it.
What if I myself would
like to try, Mr. Allison?
I'd say you was crazy too, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Allison.
The raft would have
to have a rudder.
I'll figure out some way to fix it.
Could the sail be of palm?
I know how to thatch.
Good.
I sure hope you like fish, ma'am.
Because after about a week
when the fruit runs out,
there's going to be
nothing else but,
raw fish, at that.
And I'm sure I'll get used to it.
Oh, sure.
Now, that was a dope question.
It's a cinch you'd like fish,
with your religion and all.
You know, the guys in the corps,
the ones who go to see the chaplain
the night before an attack,
have to eat fish on Friday,
we call them mackerel snap...
What is it you call
them, Mr. Allison?
Huh? Who?
The ones who have to
eat fish on Fridays.
Oh, we call them, uh...
- Um...
- Is it mackerel snappers?
Yeah. Yeah, that's what
some of the guys call them.
But they're good marines,
ma'am, the best.
I'm glad to hear that.
Of what faith are you, Mr. Allison?
Huh?
What church did your
parents raise you in?
Oh, I didn't have no parents.
I was an orphanage kid.
You mean you never
knew your parents?
They died when you were little?
I mean there I was at the Allison
Street entrance one morning...
in an empty egg crate.
Allison Street, Milwaukee.
I figure I'm a...
I figure I'm illegitimate.
Well, what's the difference,
I say. I got born, didn't I?
Didn't they give you any religious
teaching in the orphanage?
Oh, sure.
Every Sunday, some skinny old
crack used to come around...
and go on about what cigarettes
will do to your insides and...
things.
But I broke out of
there when I was 14.
The next few years,
I seen the insides of more halls
of correction and jails...
than I did churches.
Then I joined the marines.
Now, you look at me, ma'am.
What do you see besides
a big, dumb guy?
I'll tell ya.
A marine, that's what I am.
All through me, a marine,
like you're a nun.
You got your cross. I got
my globe and anchor.
It took a lot of working over,
but they're the ones could do it.
My first D.I....
That's, uh, drill
instructor, ma'am.
When I was a recruit, he
looks me up and down,
and he says, "Lad, I'm gonna
make you hate my guts.‚Äù
The old peep sight.
He sure kept his promise.
There were times I
wanted to commit murder.
Then I seen the light,
and I started being a marine.
Other guys, you know, most of them,
they got homes, families.
Me, I got the corps,
like you got the church.
Yes, I'm...
I'm sure they have
many things in common.
Yeah.
Yeah!
You should have known my D.I.
Your D.I., ma'am?
Yes. Sister Brigida, the
mistress of novices.
We had a name for her too.
Yeah, what was that?
We called her the...
The Holy Terror.
Um, not getting personal or
anything, ma'am, but, uh,
are you different from other nuns?
I-I don't think so.
Well, uh, I never thought nuns
made with the jokes, you know.
No offense, ma'am.
Of course not.
I never thought there were
any pretty nuns either.
Ooh, you should've seen
Sister Mary Fidelis.
We took our novitiate together.
She was a model before she
joined the community.
Her face was in all the
fashion magazines.
Yeah?
Sister Mary Fidelis was the
loveliest girl I ever saw.
Well, what did she
want to be a nun for?
Because it gave her greater
happiness than anything else.
I don't get it.
Well, maybe there are some...
as wouldn't understand a man
wanting to be a marine.
- It's a meatball.
- A what?
Japanese.
Oh, do you think they saw me?
Can't tell. Maybe.
Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Allison.
Did I hurt you, ma'am, when I
pushed you down like that?
- Oh, no, no, no.
- He's coming back.
He's doing a recon job, like
giving this place the once-over.
For what reason, do you think?
I don't know. Nothing good.
You know, the other day when we
was up there, I spotted a cave.
Might not be a bad idea for us to spend
the next few nights in that cave,
till we get that raft
finished and shove off.
There you are, ma'am, water.
Oh, splendid.
Your bed is made, Mr. Allison.
Oh, thanks, ma'am.
Well, this isn't too bad, is it?
It's a very pleasant cave, indeed.
Land crabs and all?
Ah, they're quite harmless.
Well,
guess I'll climb into the rack.
Climb?
Where?
Bed down.
- You know, go to sleep.
- Oh.
Oh, ma'am,
if you hear me rustling
around early in the morning,
don't let it bother you.
I'm used to cussing
the music at 5:30.
No, it won't. We're
always up at 5:00.
Sounds like you're in a
pretty tough outfit, ma'am.
It is, Mr. Allison.
It is.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, Mr. Allison.
Bless, O Lord, the rest
I am about to take...
What, ma'am?
Holy Virgin, Mother of God,
and after him my only hope,
my good angel, my holy patrons,
intercede for me and protect
me during this night,
all my life long and particularly
at the hour of my death.
Amen.
I was saying my prayers.
Oh.
Do you never say
yours, Mr. Allison?
No, ma'am.
Well, did you never pray?
No, ma'am.
Well, sure... You do
believe in God the Father?
Oh, sure, ma'am. Anybody with
any sense believes in God.
They're back, ma'am,
like I thought.
So you better take it easy.
What I mean, brace yourself.
Things are going to start
popping around here.
But don't be scared.
We're safe in this here cave.
This is a made-to-order
bomb shelter.
The noise is gonna be fierce,
but noise never hurt nobody, ma'am.
I'm all right, truly.
Noise can't hurt us, ma'am.
Don't think me a coward because
I'm trembling this way.
It's...
Truly, I'm quite calm inside.
Everybody gets the
shakes sometimes, ma'am,
even an old marine like me.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
It's all over, ma'am.
All over.
We're okay.
Thank God there was no one
out there to be killed.
Thought you might want that, ma'am.
This island's sure beat up, huh?
Fruit's all blasted.
There isn't a whole coconut left.
Our, uh...
Our trip to Fiji is off, ma'am.
The raft?
It's done for.
I was just about to say
things couldn't look blacker,
when all of a sudden, they do.
What do you mean?
There's a Japanese ship
coming around the point.
Why are they shooting?
Oh, they got to have shooting.
Wouldn't be a proper
landing without shooting.
Well. When they find nothing,
will they leave, do you think?
From all the stuff
they're bringing ashore,
I'd say they was gonna make
this a weather station.
You know, give Tokyo the dope...
on which way the wind's
blowing, if it's raining.
We better crawl back
in our hole, ma'am.
They'll be coming up pretty
soon for a look-see.
There ain't much we won't know about
this cave before we're through.
Fact is, ma'am, you've had your
last look at the outside...
for a pretty long time.
With that, uh, white nun's dress,
you won't dare stick
your nose outside...
even at night, if there's a moon.
I'm going to ask you to sit
down and be real quiet.
Make like a statue.
Don't speak, even to whisper,
beginning right now.
Our luck's holding, ma'am.
For a minute there,
thought we was gonna be on the
receiving end of a grenade.
But I guess they was just
getting their breaths.
You can talk now,
ma'am, if you want to.
Mr. Allison?
Yeah?
I'm going to turn myself
over to the Japanese.
What?
I think it's the only
thing for me to do.
What kind of talk is that?
Alone, you might be
able to survive,
but not with me to feed too.
Turn yourself over?
The worst that could
happen to me...
is that I'd be interned in
some perfectly safe place.
That ain't the worst that
could happen, ma'am.
I'm sure they would
respect my vocation...
and do me no harm.
Maybe you're right, I don't know,
but that's just the point...
not knowing, I'd blow my top.
I'd be down there throwing
coconuts at them.
Look, for the sake of my
morale, ma'am, let's, uh...
Let's not have any more
talk like that, huh?
As far as feeding another
mouth is concerned,
you leave that to the marines.
Please try, ma'am. Like me. Look.
One, into the mouth.
Two, chew twice.
Three, swallow.
I'm sorry, Mr. Allison, I...
I'm afraid I'm not a very
good mackerel snapper.
-
-
Mr. Allison?
Mr. Allison?
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...
Oh...
Hey!
Ma'am!
Sister Angela.
You're alive! Oh, you're alive!
Shh, quiet, ma'am. Of course
I am. Alive and kicking.
Well, I... I heard
shooting, and I thought...
Didn't I tell you never
to leave that cave?
I am very put out
with you. Yes, I am.
- Well, I... I thought they'd killed you...
- Put out!
Inside you go. I've got
something to show you.
Now, no more crying, ma'am.
Look, we got food! Lots of it.
Bean sprouts, beef, water
chestnuts, cans and cans.
I woke up, and you weren't there.
I waited.
It became morning, and
still you didn't come.
- Now, come on, eat, ma'am. You need to.
- I thought you were dead!
Go ahead, ma'am, eat.
Promise me you'll never go
again without telling me,
because I'll never sleep.
I-I'd be afraid to close me eyes.
Promise me now. Promise!
Sure, ma'am.
You like it?
Oh, it's...
It's beautiful, Mr. Allison.
The teeth are a little
wide apart maybe, but, uh,
it's the best I could
do with only a knife.
You really like it, ma'am?
Oh. Oh, yes.
But, you see,
we don't use combs.
Our hair is worn very short
Oh, it is?
From the day we take our vows.
Hmm.
Shows you how dumb I am.
Well, I guess I could
always use it...
to comb my beard, huh?
Mr. Allison,
may I have it for a keepsake?
Sure.
I shall cherish it always.
You know, I bet your hair...
was long and yellow and wavy.
Didn't bother you to have
it cut off like that, huh?
It's no great sacrifice.
Um, ma'am,
suppose a nun...
changed her mind, you know?
She didn't want to
be a nun anymore.
What could she do about it?
Our vows are not taken
lightly, Mr. Allison.
You mean no nun ever got out?
Well, it has happened, but rarely.
If the reasons are truly grave,
His Holiness in Rome sometimes
grants a special dispensation.
Huh?
Permission from the pope.
Oh.
Without that, it would be like...
a marine's going
over the hill, huh?
What?
- Desertion.
- Worse. Much worse.
They wouldn't shoot you?
We would lose our immortal souls.
Oh.
But such a thing is
inconceivable, you see,
because we're given
such a long time...
to make up our minds
and our hearts.
You are, huh?
Even after our novitiate,
we have five years,
and only then do we
take our final vows.
I was to have taken
mine next month.
You was, and it...
What's that?
I said I was to have taken
my final vows next month.
You mean, um,
you still, uh,
if you wanted to, that is,
y-you still could,
like, uh, pull out?
I could...
if my mind and my heart
were not made up.
Guns.
Heavy stuff.
Battlewagons slugging it out.
Like having two-dollar seats
to a Joe Louis fight, ain't it?
Just too far away to see anything.
Wow.
That one found the magazine.
Hey, ma'am!
Ma'am!
Sister Angela!
They've gone. Come on out.
You hear me, ma'am?
Yes, Mr. Allison.
Coming.
Coming, Mr. Allison.
They've gone, ma'am.
Pulled out during the
night, every mother's son.
Yes, they've really gone.
You don't have to
whisper now, ma'am.
You can shout if
you want to. Yahoo!
They left all kinds
of stuff here, ma'am.
Rice. Soap even.
We're sitting pretty, ma'am.
-
- We're pitching us a liberty, ma'am.
You know how I'd like to start?
By washing my clothes and
getting clean again.
Some moon, ain't it, ma'am?
Things are... Things are just
as bright as day almost.
Funny, it seems bigger than
that stateside moon, huh?
It's a lovely moon...
to sew by.
What a gay little song.
Do you know the words, Mr. Allison?
Um...
Ah, this terrible war,
taking young men from
their sweethearts.
Isn't there someone back home...
waiting for you, Mr. Allison?
No, ma'am.
Now, that's hard to believe.
Big handsome fella like you...
You should have a wife and family.
Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am, there's something
I'd like to say to you.
Yes, Mr. Allison.
Well, uh,
it's like this, uh, ma'am.
Yes, Mr. Allison?
You know them big red flowers?
Hibiscus?
Yeah. Well, uh,
if you like, I'll
pick some for you.
Thank you.
Mr. Allison, would
it be all right...
if I didn't sleep in the
cave, but out in the open?
It's such a lovely night.
Oh, sure, ma'am. I'll fix a
lean-to for you on the hill...
so you can duck into the cave
quick-like if you have to.
What do you think is going
to happen next, Mr. Allison?
Oh, I don't know. That big
sea battle, maybe we won it.
That's why the Japanese pulled out.
In which case, it's our guys'
turn to clobber the island.
Would they make a
landing afterward?
It figures.
Do you think they'll come soon?
Ought to be right away.
Oh.
Oh, I hope.
I hope.
Ma'am, I just got to tell you.
What?
When you go back home again,
ma'am, don't do it, huh? Please.
Please don't.
Don't do what?
Don't take those vows,
those... those final ones.
Don't do it, huh, ma'am?
I, um,
I never loved anything
or anybody before.
I never even lived before,
not... really lived...
inside.
So, uh,
that's why I want to
ask you to marry me.
I want to look after you,
not only while we're here, but, uh,
for the rest of our lives.
I couldn't keep from
saying it, ma'am.
So, uh,
tell me...
i-if there's a chance, huh?
I-I don't mean to give
offense, ma'am, but, uh,
is there?
No, Mr. Allison.
You see, I've already
given my heart...
to Christ, our Lord.
You mean like you was
engaged or something?
Yes.
This is the ring.
And when I make my final vows,
I'll wear a gold one,
a marriage ring.
Oh, I... I didn't know.
I didn't know it was
set up like that. I...
I guess I didn't have
no right to speak.
Well, guess I'll go, uh,
fix that lean-to for you.
Hello, ma'am.
Well, no sign of 'em yet.
Our guys, I mean.
But you do think they're coming?
They've got to.
Of course, uh, nothing's
certain in this crazy war.
Ma'am.
Yes, Mr. Allison.
I must have been off
my rocker last night.
A marine oughtn't to get married.
That ain't fair to his
family or the corps.
One of them's gotta
get the short end.
Like just before an attack,
he asks himself which is better...
A dead husband or a bad marine?
He ends up both.
Even a peacetime
marriage ain't no good.
A marine gets sent
all over the world.
What I mean, there's all
kinds of temptations.
So, uh, it's better, you know,
that he ain't tied down-like.
You do me a favor, huh, ma'am?
Just, uh, forget I
opened my big mouth.
Certainly, Mr. Allison.
The rice'll be ready in a minute.
Look, Mr. Allison, what I
found in the rice sack.
It has a most peculiar odor.
I wonder what it could be.
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.
That's, uh, sake.
It's, uh, kind of a Japanese drink.
Oh, yes. Sake.
It, uh... isn't that the
wine made from rice?
Well, it's kind of like wine,
yeah, ma'am, only a
little bit stronger.
Will you have one with me?
Well, uh,
perhaps
Just a small one.
Here's how.
How.
Oh. Yes, it is strong, isn't it?
Oh.
Ohh.
Mr. Allison, what's the matter?
Matter? Nothing's the matter.
What makes you think
something's the matter?
Well, you... You haven't
eaten anything.
Haven't I?
Mr. Allison.
Don't you think you...
you've had enough sake?
No, ma'am.
I'm pitching myself a liberty.
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
No, no, no, don't sit
under the apple tree...
What'd you want to be a nun for?
Mr. Allison,
please.
It's just my luck.
That's old Allison's luck.
If you have to be a nun, why
aren't you old and ugly?
Huh?
Mr. Allison, I-I think
I've mastered this...
This Japanese game.
It's a little like draughts.
Why do you have to
have big blue eyes...
and a beautiful smile?
And freckles.
Did you ever play draughts?
No, ma'am. Only craps.
Craps. Acey-deucey.
Well, then I'll teach you.
It's quite simple.
Now, then, you're
white, and I'm black.
The object of the game is
to take each other's men.
That's all old Allison needs,
a game of draughts.
That'll fix everything up.
You don't want to play?
No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.
I mean...
I don't want to play
no game of draughts.
Yes. Well, then in that case,
I think I'll say good night.
Good night, ma'am.
Mr. Allison!
Poor Father Phillips
loved this pipe.
You ought to be ashamed.
What good is it without tobacco?
Let me tell you something, ma'am.
We're gonna be on this
island for years and years.
Till the war's over anyway.
If our guys were coming, they
would've been here by now.
What I mean, we been bypassed.
Have we, Mr. Allison?
It's just you and me, see?
Now, what's the point your being
a nun if we're all alone?
Answer me that.
You can't, can you?
'Cause there ain't no point.
No more than my being a marine.
What would you do all day, pray?
And I, uh, I'd drill, I guess, huh?
I can see that.
You telling those beads and me
doing the manual of arms...
different ends of the island.
We don't belong to nothing
beyond this island.
All we got is it and each other.
Like Adam and Eve. Like, uh...
Like we was the first two
people on the earth,
and this is the Garden of Eden.
Ohh.
What you crying about, ma'am?
Come back, ma'am.
Sister Angela.
Where are you?
Come back this very minute!
Do you hear me, ma'am?
Answer me!
Please, ma'am, answer me.
Where are you, ma'am?
Oh.
Ma'am.
Why'd you want to run off
like that for, ma'am?
I didn't mean what I said.
Any of it. I was
only drunk-talking.
You don't have to be
afraid of me, ma'am.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'd rather die first.
Here, ma'am.
Now, ma'am.
Shh. Put-Put out the light.
Sister Brigida's coming.
N-Now, ma'am.
I didn't... I didn't do it.
Cold. I'm cold.
Ma'am.
I'm cold.
Ma'am, we gotta get them
wet clothes off ya.
- You hear me, ma'am?
- Hmm? Hmm?
You gotta help me, ma'am.
Hmm?
Gotta get them wet clothes off ya.
Mr. Allison?
Yes, ma'am.
What's happened?
You been sick, ma'am, awful sick.
Have I?
Two, three days now.
You've... You've been, um,
out of your head-like.
Ooh. Why are we in the cave?
The Japanese have come back, ma'am.
Oh, I, uh...
You were shakin'
with cold, ma'am. I...
I had to get you out
of them wet clothes.
Thank you, Mr. Allison.
I don't deserve no thanks.
It was my fault you got sick.
I was drunk, and, uh,
you got scared of me...
and ran away from me in the rain.
I ran away?
Oh, yes.
Please forgive me, ma'am.
I wasn't running from you.
You wouldn't have done
me any harm. I knew that.
I was running from the truth.
How's that, ma'am?
There was a great deal of
truth in what you said.
No, there wasn't, ma'am.
Not a bit.
Like I said we was gonna
be alone on this island...
for years and years.
Very next thing, 2,000
Japanese show up.
How wrong could a guy get?
Dear Mr. Allison,
they might not be here tomorrow.
Tomorrow might not come.
Perhaps God doesn't intend
me to take my final vows.
We're... We're living
from hour to hour.
Only he knows what'll happen to us.
And he won't tell, huh, ma'am?
He might.
They're swarming all
over the island, ma'am,
burnin' down the tall grass
and the bamboo groves.
But why, Mr. Allison?
Do you know why?
Must have found the body.
Body?
What body?
The one got his throat cut.
You killed a man?
It was a case of had to,
ma'am. He come at me.
When you went down
to get the blankets?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, dear God, forgive me.
You had to kill a man
because I ran away.
That's crazy talk, ma'am.
He was the enemy.
It's my duty to destroy the enemy.
I've been...
neglectin' it, you might
say, account of you.
They're coming up here.
Now, look, I'm gonna do
a fast turn outside,
you know, just show my bushy tail,
and then lose them and
double back here.
- Now, you just sit tight.
- No, Mr. Allison.
We'll remain here,
or we'll go out, as
you wish, but...
together.
All right, ma'am.
Dear God, Mr. Allison here
is not of the church.
He's only a-a marine,
but he is a good man, brave
and very, very honest.
I humbly implore thee when his
time comes, to be merciful...
and receive him into
thy holy presence.
Hey, Joe!
Come out with hands up!
Okay, Joe, you get grenade.
Ma'am!
You all right, ma'am?
Yes.
That wasn't a grenade.
It was a bomb. Bombs fallin'!
That's the stuff, navy!
Yeah! Pour it on 'em!
Hey, ma'am!
Ma'am, they're here! It's our guys!
They're here!
Look at 'em!
Hey, guys!
Come on! Hubba! Hubba! Hubba!
Funny. Our stuff sounds different
coming in than the Japanese stuff.
I mean, our stuff sounds good,
like firecrackers to a kid.
When will they try to land?
Try? What do you mean try?
They'll land, all right,
if they're marines.
Of course. If they're marines.
They'll come ashore when
it starts gettin' light.
Will there be many... casualties?
It figures.
The navy'll cease fire just
before our guys hit the beach.
That's when the Japanese will come
crawlin' out of their holes...
and open up with those 105s.
- 105s?
- Big rifles, ma'am.
Rough on landing craft.
The Japanese have got four
of them, hid real good.
Yeah, that's the tough time,
that last 200, 300 yards.
Half the guys get it, get it then.
What time is it, Mr. Allison?
Ain't 5:00 yet.
About an hour to go.
What is it, Mr. Allison?
Ma'am, you remember sayin' God
might tell us what's gonna happen?
Yes.
Well, his voice don't have
to be big and loud, does it,
and come from above?
Oh, no. It usually
comes from within.
Well, that case, I think he's
talking to me right now.
Truly, Mr. Allison?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what is he saying?
He's sayin' this here landing's
gonna be real easy-like,
without hardly anybody
gettin' killed.
Oh, thanks be to him.
All it needs is for them 105s
to get put out of commission.
And is there a way to do that?
Yes, ma'am. He just
told me the way.
It's so simple I should
have thought of it myself.
You just keep pourin' it
in, navy. Keep it comin'.
Keep their heads down
for another half hour,
and you leave the rest to Allison.
Mr. Allison, are you sure
it's God you're obeying...
and not your own natural desire
to take part in the fighting?
Pretty sure, ma'am.
Then he'll protect you.
Well, mission accomplished,
like they say, ma'am.
Ooh.
I ain't killed, nothin'.
Ooh. Ooh, lie down, Mr. Allison.
Small arms.
They're ashore.
Come on, marines.
Hubba-hubba.
Ma'am, we're coming to the
end of our time together.
Oh, we'll be seeing each
other on and off...
for the next couple
of days maybe, but...
it won't ever be just the
two of us again, so...
I'd like to say this now.
Very pleased to have
met you, ma'am.
It was a...
privilege to know you.
I wish you ev-every happiness.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Allison.
No matter how many
miles apart we are...
or whether I ever get
to see your face again,
you will be my dear
companion always.
Always.
Hey, marine, you got a cigarette?
I don't get it, Cap'n.
Four howitzers, plenty of
ammo, no breechblocks.
- They haven't fired a round.
- Beats me.
