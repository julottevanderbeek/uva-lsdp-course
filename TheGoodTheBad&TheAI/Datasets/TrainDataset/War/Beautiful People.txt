Good news.

They said he's gone to HoIIand .
Why wouId he go to HoIIand?
Because drugs are a snip over there.
Our chiId's days are numbered .
It doesn't tak e. . .

We were chiIdhood sweethearts.
And are you stiII happy?

He moved from radio to teIevision,

They sen t him to America a Iot.
To Washington .
ChIoe got to know
her dad on videotape.
Then the assignmen ts changed .
IreIand, Lebanon,
IsraeI .
I mean, Jerry wouId say. . .
there was more chance of him
being kiIIed in Washington .
That's the murder capitaI .
But at Ieast he understood
the Ianguage.
Now the Ianguages are aII . . .
they're aII differen t. . .
and mixed .
I worry for him .
It scares me.
I can't work properIy 'cause
I'm j ust on edge the whoIe time.
Sometimes I think . . .
why don't we j ust start again?
Buy a croft. . .
and go and Iive in peace.
WouIdn't that be IoveIy,
Dr. MouIdy?
WouIdn't you Iik e

Excuse me, Mr. Higgins, can you

Of course it does!
No one's gonna notice anyway.

A NATO spok esman

NATO is beIieved

How Iong have you
been doing this?
But ''wait and see'' is the
poIicy preferred by everyone.
''How Iong?''
is the question, Griffin .
I am a respected man,
Griffin .
I know you don't give
a toss about that, but I do.
I do give a toss.
Making a fooI of us aII .
You'II end up. . . Iock ed away

Your heaIth and your brain
wiII degenerate.
Your young heart and your Iungs
wiII putrefy.
You'II die,
and then where wiII you be?
You may think
this is a fashionabIe habit.
This habit is a terribIe,
awfuI, unimaginabIe. . .
''Horror''?
Is that what it is?
Griffin, are you hungry?
Do you wan t a sausage roII?
. . .Iooking a bit Iost.

We're gonna strip it

It's great stuff.
''The HospitaI of HeII''
or ''Four Nigh ts in the
HospitaI of HeII,'' depending .
It's absoIuteIy
the sort of thing
that's gonna suck
an audience in for us.
And it's cost effective,
which is great.
So you shouId be pIeased .
Brian, Brian, Brian,
you don't understand !
An audience has gotta see,
it's gotta feeI . . .

You are EngIish?
Do I Iook EngIish?
No, I was j ust asking .
I'm from WaIes,
the Iand of song . . .
where the women are pretty,
and the beer is cheap.
Do you know,
in my viIIage. . .
the IocaI peopIe can't afford
to buy houses. . .
'cause they're aII being bough t up
by the EngIish bastards
for hoIiday homes.
They've tak en everything

They tried to tak e

He started it.
He and his famiIy started it aII .
They started . . .
Are you a Serb and a Croat?
No, no, no. . .
It's totaIIy differen t.
I'm a Croat and he is Serb. . .
and they burned our viIIage.
They started it.
They kiIIed our sheep.
Do you know what's amazing?
Do you know what's extraordinary?
You both have exactIy

. . .the BB C have faiIed
to re estabIish con tact
with war corresponden t,
Jerry Higgins.
Since his dramatic return
on a UN mercy fIigh t from Bosnia. . .
Jerry Higgins has been recovering
at his home in London .
For the Iast two years,
Mr. Higgins. . .
has been successfuIIy
reporting for the BB C
from troubIe spots
around the worId .
Mr. Higgins,
seen here in action
reporting from a fieId
hospitaI in Srebrenica,
was inj ured by sniper fire
and evacuated
on an RAF transport pIane.
Mr. Higgins is though t
to beIieve
that in ternaI restructuring
in the BB C has con tributed
to an escaIation
of the crisis in the BaIkans.
Brian North reads Jerry Higgins'
dispatch from Srebenica.
You migh t find some
of the pictures disturbing .
As dawn swirIs,
the Bosnian vaIIey echoes
to the sound of UN Iorries.
The BB C was the first TV network
to en ter the besieged
fieId hospitaI .
They've ask ed me to do
some charity work .
Charity work? You?
Yeah . Why not?
I can't get a job. . .
and I've got pIen ty
of free time, so. . .
I though t I couId do
something positive.
. . .we encoun tered Red Cross
mercy work er, Griffin Midge,
an EngIishman sacrificing
his own Iife. . .
to heIp
those Iess fortunate.
He aIone managed to pass
through Serb checkpoin ts
and smuggIe in
much needed drugs.
And so, as these dispossessed
peopIe run for their Iives. . .
There's someone
I think you shouId meet.
. . .with the fIames that torched
their homes stiII smouIdering,
we say goodbye. . .

Iess fortunate Ieft behind .

I was in Bosnia,
and I got inj ured, okay?
UnfortunateIy, the buIIet
wen t straigh t through,
and it missed the main bone,
so they didn't have to operate.
The probIem is now,
the doctors say
in a coupIe of days
my Ieg's gonna be fine,
and I won't need
the crutches anymore.
That's good .
What do you wan t from me?
I wan t you to amputate.
You don't need to use anesthetics

Cut it off

Two Iegged piece of shit

Oh, heII, here we come!
So, you came back,
you were unhappy with the British
response to the war,
and you decided
to amputate your Ieg
No, no, no, that's not it.
I inj ured my Ieg
You toId this to your wife,
then to your BB C boss.
They cut off a man's Ieg
in fron t of my eyes.
No anesthetic,
no pain kiIIers, nothing .
A cIean cut. Whack .
His Ieg popped off his body
Iik e a wine cork .
A UN soIdier treated
my Ieg immediateIy.
Then you smuggIed yourseIf
in to a London hospitaI
and threatened the nurse
that you wouId kiII her
unIess she amputated your Ieg .
Yes.
Jerry.
TerribIe, isn't it?
He's suffering
from ''Bosnia Syndrome'' .
Don't worry, it's not as bad
as ''GuIf War Syndrome'' .
This one is curabIe.
What is ''Bosnia Syndrome''?
I've never heard of it.
It's an obsession
with heIping peopIe. Doing good .
You iden tify with the victim
to the exten t
that you see the worId
through the victim's eyes.
In severe cases,
the distinction
becomes so bIurred,
that you become the victim,
and the victim becomes you .
Pero, do you have a dream ?
I do have a dream .
I wouId Iik e to have
safe journey to Mars.
