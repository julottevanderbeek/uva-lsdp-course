An RAF bomber
Night attack over Germany
Operation codename "Tea for 2"
Water's nippy this morning, isn't it?
Come quickly
Take my hand
American?
No, English.
Hurry up, the zoo will open soon.
Germans are everywhere.
Give me the parachute.
Take all your things.
Get back up!
He's gonna make me fall!
I'm sorry...
Did I dirty your uniform?
This is a misunderstanding.
No way.
I'm coming up.
Stop shooting. Search the houses
and take them alive.
This is not a place to land!
Are you injured?
Very high.
Thank you Gentlemen. It was very good.
You over there: very good.
You were good, well so so...
You over there, we did no hear you.
We never hear you.
You do nothing but chit-chat
You better behave.
I have a personal vision of this work.
Not triumphant enough,
Not proud enough!
All this is mush actually.
It was not bad,
It was very bad.
Let's start again from Number 17
No Sir, chit-chatting again!
Stay focused.
Goodness gracious, you are talkative!
From Number 17 again
Who did this?
Me, Maestro
Where do you think you are?
The Opera, Maestro.
Amusing. Out!
Mephisto, Marguerite, Faust, out!
I want nobody here when I'm working!
Only Berlioz and I.
Keep it down please.
Sorry Mr Lefort.
Number 17
More flamboyant please.
Like lightning before thunder.
Are you coming darling?
In a minute.
Bébert, the explosives.
Wires
Make sure there's nobody outside.
You plug the hole.
If you keep making so much noise,
Lefort will poke his nose in our business.
Are you done?
Ready to blow.
This flower is poking out.
Do not touch it!
My wire is connected to it.
You'd blow the whole thing.
Silence!
Search everywhere.
Lights!
Everyone stay put.
Leaving is forbidden!
A British paratrooper has hidden
in the opera house
Anyone giving him assistance
will be shot
Herr Conductor, we have shot down
a British bomber over Paris.
Two pilots are hiding here.
Very sorry to interrupt your rehearsal.
You heard the man...
Machine guns have reduced our
rehearsal to 12 minutes.
It will be a nice performance tonight!
Let me through.
The nerve.
Stopping a rehearsal!
I am French... The Germans...
Please help.
I am fed up, fed up!
Open the door
or we break it open.
Yes, yes, I'm coming!
Sorry Gentlemen.
This is a global house search.
Me too I'm fed up!
Shut up, you pain in the ass.
Can't you see we have visitors?
Do not mind her, please come in
You are lucky.
Your wife is far away.
You there soldier,
since you're here.
Catch this suitcase
and put it on the bed.
I'm out of here.
Stop it. Can't you see you're
putting yourself on show?
I will not stay another minute
with this idiot.
You'll see once they're gone.
I'll cure you...
Nobody on the balcony, sir.
Let's go.
I am really sorry.
They are upstairs.
Quick.
If the elevator goes to the top floor,
the Brit will be crushed.
Wait.
Too heavy.
People never close the doors...
I lost it. What?
The key.
I always put it under the carpet
but...
Quick!
Nothing to worry about.
Augustin Bouvet,
Paint and renovation
Bury this straight away. Dangerous.
U kidding? I have a wife and 6 kids. I have
enough material for shirts til the war ends.
Thanks
Alright, they have left.
The street is empty.
We shall leave too.
I'll try to bring him to my place.
Your place?
The Germans must be there already!
At my place?
Do you have a telephone at home?
Yes, Clignancourt 1335
is the number.
Wait
It won't answer. I'm not there,
since I'm here.
Augustin Bouvet please.
Speaking.
He's lying, he's not me.
Without you we would have gone home
and been captured.
What a mess!
What shall I do now?
What's he saying?
He wants to go to the Turkish Baths.
He's supposed to meet his pals
at the Turkish Baths.
Another English brain-dead idea...
Wounded, and not speaking French.
He will be caught straight away.
I'll find him clothing.
We'll meet at my grandfather's place
Where is that?
The Puppet Theatre on Champs-Elysees.
I work with him.
Search there
Search here
I go in to check
Come in
No no no like the birds,
Chirp chirp chirp.
This time I shall not interrupt
your rehearsal. Please continue.
Enough.
What are you looking for?
Your Englishman?
Not him
Follow me
He's not here right?
Not here either?
Not here.
You interrupt my rehearsal.
Now you interrupt my lesson.
Forgive me Herr Conductor.
Yeah yeah I forgive you.
Come here. He's not here right?
There? He's no more there.
And here, what's here?
Allow me.
Ah. Black Market.
No - It's for the interval.
I'm always hungry.
My stomach goes like this...
So I need to eat.
That's why I keep provisions.
Big crook.
No, small crook.
Have some...
No thank you, Herr Conductor.
Sorry, I must be going.
Good-bye
Right, back to lesson Number 4.
Let's see...
No speaking, just shut up.
Do not say a word.
Sit on the music stool.
We shall now read a bit of music.
Me, go to the Turkish baths?
Do not whistle this.
American song
Forbidden here.
Gentlemen, I overheard you.
You were talking of Mc Intosh and Peter, right?
No no no
Don't know what you are talking about.
I am looking for a friend.
Lost him in the fog.
Have you met him by chance?
Big mustache.
I am... I was big mustache.
Follow me
His accent sounds real.
Let's follow him.
Herr Conductor, are you there?
Open this door, now!
Major, have a look.
He has fled
Catch him.
Put this back in its original place
Now, I wait for you, Herr Conductor.
Opera house, quick.
Coming.
Are you crazy?
Stealing German uniforms!
We need them for operation Mc Intosh
tonight at the Opera house.
No, it is too dangerous
I do not want to, understood?
Where is the Englishman?
I am sick...
Not sick... It was him!
No, this is a harp.
Where is the Englishman?
There's an Englishman here??
Your explanation does not
satisfy me!
But it's rather clear!
I am regular army
not secret police
But if you refuse to talk
I'll hand you over to a department
that will make you talk.
Naturally
Only after this evening's performance,
held for our Brigadier.
Until then, you are my prisoner.
I arrest you, Madame Crook.
You have no right to arrest me.
Isn't it, children?
No
If Guignol was here,
He would save me.
He won't come.
Help me shout for him...
Guignol, Guignol.
What audacity, going around dressed
as German officers.
What if the police asks for
our papers?
You are talking too loudly.
She is only 3.
You're right, she's looking at me.
Two Germans at the back.
Fortunately, General AUGUSTIN
will come to my rescue.
Help me call for him.
Augustin.
What a great day...
Two English pilots,
A French hero
My granddaughter spoke of
you and your great courage.
Really? You mentioned me to your family?
How about her. She was great.
I am not surprised.
Gentlemen, my noble theatre is a
poor hiding place...
However Juliette and I can help
you leave Paris.
If we manage to sneak into unoccupied France,
we sure can make it back to England.
England?
I bloody well can't go to England!
Go with them.
It's safer for you.
There you have it.
The beautiful France.
I summarize
Tomorrow morning 8h05 you
take the train for Burgundy.
Once in Meursault, go directly to
"Hotel du Globe".
No need to take notes.
My granddaughter is going with you.
You're coming along?
Of course, the adventure goes on.
Isn't it exciting, Augustin?
Kindof.
Thanks. Thanks to all of you.
However tonight
I must first go to the Opera
To look for my friend Mc Intosh.
Augustin, you will come with me.
Well, err...
Ok, I'll go.
Won't take long. Get in, pick up
Mc Intosh and hightail out of there.
We have to get backstage.
Excuse me sir, how do we get backstage?
End of the corridor, to the left.
This way, Herr General.
Poor Lefort.
What do we do?
Shall we cancel?
Too late. Too bad for Lefort.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Shit. It failed.
This time it was not me!
Stop
Intermission...
It was not me, it was not me!
It's me!
Ah then it's me.
Pretend you are our prisoner.
No, go left.
The gates of Hell?
No, an underground river under the Opera.
Where does it exit?
According to Victor Hugo, nowhere.
God bless you.
With your bald head, you're gonna catch a cold.
Take my cap.
Leave me alone and mind your oars!
Would you please calm down...
Germans?
No, the subway
Get out? Ah, ok.
Come on, quickly.
We cannot get out
dressed like this...
We will all be caught.
Wait
Who are you?
Do not worry.
We will not harm you.
My wallet
What time is it?
Excuse me, was this the train for
Chalons-sur-Saone?
Yes
When is the next one?
I don't know.
Ask the information counter.
Look - a roadblock.
Something must be going down.
Stop - What is this?
Postal Service
Don't bother.
It's out of gas.
Push the car this way.
To hide it.
Push
Come on! Push!
Speak to me politely.
Would you please push, maestro?
That's better.
Slowly, slowly
Stop
Now dear friends,
let's share our food stamps.
French stamps, printed in London.
French money.
Not printed in London.
Let's go Augustin.
Why must he always call me Augustine?
Hey, why don't I get any?
Wait a minute.
I am short of one.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Wait for me, for crying out loud!
Hurry up!
My feet are swelling up.
Leave me alone.
My foot is huge.
Come on, let's go.
Stand up... Stanislas.
A little bit of respect, please.
You cannot order me around.
Listen, my dear.
We belong to two different worlds.
Between us, there will always be... this
Give me your hand.
You are so showy!
Be careful... Be very careful.
Fine.
Wait for me...
We'll be back!
Look, they ran off!
They are abandoning us!
Darn, I never thought
they could be like that
What will become of us?
Do not worry, we will keep walking.
We will make it anyway, gentlemen!!
Wear your shoes
Lean on my arm for support.
See, that's what the English are capable of.
I'm surprised. They were rather nice.
You must have had an English nanny!
Thief! Thief!
These shoes are not made for long walks.
That explains why.
I accept your kind offer.
What offer?
To lend me your shoes.
What size do you wear?
Same as yours.
All right
Ah. That's better.
Wait for me.
Come on...
I have to get used to them.
Come on, get moving.
The Germans!
We're lucky you have quick reflexes.
Thank you
Don't mention it.
How about the Englishmen?
What?
They will be caught
You're right - they should had stayed with us
Alright. Let's go.
Wait. I return you your shoes.
I'm afraid of making them bigger.
Ah yes. You are damaging them...
Are my shoes ok?
A bit wide.
Sorry about that.
Are you coming?
Come on, come on.
Who did you steal this from?
Me. Good morning, sirs
Good morning, Sister.
Let's hurry. I am expected
at the Beaunes hospital.
Get on quickly
Would you pass the salt please.
This needs pepper too.
Charles Péguy.
Wonderful poet, isn't he?
You see,
I know your language well.
What is it?
What? Really? Excellent!
We searched the whole train.
There was no other Englishman.
Excellent.
Search the entire neighbourhood.
Yes Major.
Send him to the nearest Kommandantur
...Meursault.
Ok, Meursault.
I'll be there tonight.
