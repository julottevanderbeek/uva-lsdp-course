Vikings...
I order the arrest of Floki
for the murder of Athelstan.
RAGNAR: You betrayed
my trust and my love for you.
I did as the gods commanded.
Are you going to kill me or not?
BJORN: I've come to tell you
I'm going away.
I want to go out into the wilderness.
Why are you really going?
Because you don't think I can survive.
Queen Kwenthrith has been
weakened by civil wars.
Without Wessex,
Mercia is at the mercy
of other Saxon neighbors.
EIRIK: Some of the warriors
are unhappy with what is happening.
You're a Frankish noble now.
I'll put all of their minds at ease.
EIRIK:
Rollo!
You have betrayed your own kind!
Ragnar will revenge us.
More, give me more, give me more
If I had a heart, I could love you
If I had a voice, I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
Ahh
If I had a voice, I would sing

GUARD 1:
Over there!
- Bring the torches! We need light!
-
GUARD 2:
Find him!
- GUARD 1: Check the barn!
- GUARD 2: We need more!
GUARD 3:
Over here!
GUARD 1:
He's gone that way!
Floki has escaped, King Ragnar.
- Of course, he has.
- GUARD 2: This way!
Well...
Go find him.
__
We have some unexpected
and urgent news from Mercia.
We have heard that several
leading Mercian nobles,
refusing to pay homage to us,
have risen in revolt against
Queen Kwenthrith,
and overthrown her.
As far as we know,
she and her son Magnus
have been imprisoned
in a tower somewhere.
Meanwhile, these rebel nobles
have set themselves up
as a Ruling Council!
This flagrant abuse of our
last treaty with Mercia
cannot and will not be tolerated.
I've already sent word to King Aelle,
our ally, summoning him here.
It may be that this time we will have
to use force to overcome Mercia.
But not before we have
made a last attempt
to rescue the Queen and her son.
- You will have to find the tower first!
-
My Lord, we have already
dispatched scouts.
We await their report.
In the meantime, we charge
you all to give warning.
Summon your men
and your supporters to arms.
But if, Prince, they may
well not be needed,
it would be a great and
unnecessary expense
to keep good men idle and at arms.
Whatever the expense, my Lord,
it is surely better to be ready
to seize the moment when it arrives,
rather than see it wasted and gone.
You are a king's son,
what do you know about
the burdens of expense?
ECBERT:
My Lords,
you talk as if it were an expensive
luxury to keep a standing army.
But I warn you,
it is rather a necessity,
for Ragnar Lothbrok,
or others just like him,
could return to these shores
at any moment!
I beg you, cease your quarrels.
We are talking about
the destiny of Wessex!
Did you free Floki, Helga?
I don't know. I might have done.
Angrboda, come.
I don't blame you.
It is your duty as a wife.
Floki loves you.
He only loves himself.
You know that better than anyone.
Winter is coming.
Whatever happens,
you and your child will need to eat.
It's food.
- CAPTAIN: Two flanks!
-
- CAPTAIN: Three! Back!
-
Get those gates open!
CAPTAIN:
High!
Two, watch your flanks!
Three! Retrieve!
CAPTAIN:
Make way for the King!
Our Mercian scouts.
All of them?
SENTRY:
Soldier approaching!
SENTRY:
He's one of ours.
- CAPTAIN: Back, one!
-
- CAPTAIN: Two! Flank!
-
- CAPTAIN: Three!
-
- CAPTAIN: Again!
-
- CAPTAIN: High!
-
- You know where the tower is?
- Yes.
And you can lead us there?
- ECBERT: Who told you?
- I don't know.
Then how can you trust him?
He was a nobleman.
He told me he refused
to join the Ruling Council.
What was his name?
- I only knew him as "W."
- ECBERT: "W?"
- Yes, Sire.
- And still you trust him?
Yes.
Of course he's a member
of the Ruling Council.
They're using Kwenthrith as bait.
- It's obvious.
- It's obvious to you.
What does that mean?
Well, it's the way you think.
Not everyone thinks like you, Father.
Then you are prepared to trust
this man's word,
and go with him to Mercia?
You go with some of our best warriors.
God also goes with you, my son.
And...
If you have any cause to doubt
the honesty of your scout,
then think as I would think.
And kill him, without conscience.
I will bear your advice
in mind, Father.
And, whatever else,
save the son!
Save Magnus.
CAPTAIN:
Mount up!
AETHELWULF:
Well, farewell, wife.
Now I trust you again,
our parting feels less sorrowful.
AETHELWULF:
Let's go!
CAPTAIN:
Move out!
What is wrong?
I have just seen my husband
ride away into the greatest danger.
Judith, whatever happens, I...
Just because you are King,
you must not presume that
things will go on as before.
I never assume anything.
After all, you cannot
force me to share your bed.
Well, I would not dream of forcing you.
Force is only necessary
against one's enemies.
And besides,
I want you to be free.
Free?
Yes.
Not just protected...
but free.
To be yourself.
I can imagine that
you have never been free
in your whole life.
Not since you were born.
Being a princess
made it all the worse.
You've lived in a gilded cage.
But, a cage...
all the same.
It's true.
I was not free to choose my husband.
You might have chosen otherwise?
Possibly.
And do you suppose any other prince
would have allowed you
to be free, hmm?
So, when you say "free,"
what is it you mean?
How can I be free?
Let me...
Let me ask you something, Judith.
What do you really want?
What do you really want to do?
If you were free to choose,
what would give you the most
pleasure and satisfaction?
Go on, say it.
Whatever you're thinking.
I'd like to be a painter,
like Athelstan.
Very well.
Then I will find you a great
teacher to instruct you.
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?
Because no woman
has ever been allowed
to study or work on the sacred texts.
Check those ashes!
HUNTER:
It is still warm.
He cannot be far away from us.
Maybe.

Here or here.
Two forts either side of the river,
to prevent the Vikings
sailing right up to the city.
But how does he mean to prevent
the boats sailing past the forts?
Ah!
- Yah!
-
- Good.
- Good.
We will build the forts.
Boat.
Shh.
Shh.
He's telling us to build more boats
capable of attacking
the Northmen in the water.
COUNT ODO:
Hmm?
Good.
So, after today, it seems
I have two reasons to be pleased.
Firstly,
Duke Rollo's sound
and interesting advice
for the protection of Paris.
And then, secondly,
Princess Gisla's horror
at marrying him.
Mmm.
I'm sure she will soon seek to
have the marriage annulled,
on the grounds that it was
never consummated...
whether that is true or not.
I have to ask, Count,
whether you are not bitter
that the Emperor
is claiming all of the credit
for saving Paris?
Of course.
I confess the sight of that little man
basking in the glow of his success
makes me feel physically ill.
Especially when I recall how
cowardly he was during the siege.
You remember that, don't you?
Paris deserves a much
stronger, braver Emperor.
Let me drink to him.
Tell me...
Do you think that his daughter
is really any braver than he is?
What do you mean?
She was brave enough
to fetch the Oriflamme.
Your desire clouded your judgment,
for she is clearly not what
you suppose her to be.
And, frankly,
a man brave enough to be Emperor
needs a consort
with real iron in her soul.
This is more of a brute
than we have used before,
and it will hurt you more.
Are you sure?
He's up there! Get him!
HUNTER 1:
Hurry! After him!
HUNTER 2:
He was here! Where did he go?
HUNTER 1:
He can't have vanished.
HUNTER 2:
Where is he?
HUNTER 2:
I saw him.
- HUNTER 1: Quick!
- Where did he go?
He's here! He's here!
HUNTER 1:
Look! Down there!
HUNTER 1:
He's there! Jump in!
HUNTER 1:
Pull him out!

Athelstan?
Who?
Who are you?
My name is Prudentius
of Troyes in Frankia.
I was told
that King Ecbert of Wessex
required a teacher of illumination.
-
- Do you know anything of this?
Yes.
Yes.
King Ecbert told me
he would ask for a teacher.
I didn't really believe him.
May I ask who you are?
I am the wife of Prince Aethelwulf,
King Ecbert's son.
Then perhaps it is one of your
sons who needs my services.
Actually, it's not one of my sons...
It's me.
That is... not possible.
What's not possible?
To work on sacred texts.
To teach the sacred mysteries
to a woman?
It's what you were hired for.
Go and ask the King.
The Count, for all his jealousy,
is impressed by our Northman.
Our new Duke Rollo.
He spoke about him a great deal.
Did he speak of anyone else?
He spoke of the Emperor.
Was he...
indiscreet?
He talked of his
utter contempt of the Emperor.
Is that indiscreet?
I must congratulate you on
extracting such useful information,
though, of course,
I regret the price
you have to pay to get it.
Now, see if you can find out
anything else about Odo,
which will discredit him
in the Emperor's eyes.
Then, when the time is right,
I will inform his Imperial Highness
of the duplicity and treachery
of his high and most trusted servant.
And then?
Then, let the cards fall as they may.
No, no, no, keep...
keep, keep pouring.
Thank you. Very good.
It's very good. Very good.
ECBERT:
Bishop Edmund,
allow me to introduce
a new member of our community.
This is Father Prudentius of Troyes.
Father Prudentius... welcome.
Forgive us, we were just
sampling last season's vintage.
I trust it was a good year.
Well, I would be most
grateful for your opinion.
Hmm?
I'm so sorry! Forgive me, I...
It's very good.
It's the way
we taste wines in Frankia.
Otherwise, we would be
perpetually drunk.
Very good.
Prudentius has come to teach us
some of the secrets of illumination.
Ah!
When Athelstan left,
he left many sacred texts
unadorned and unfinished.
I regard it as my holy duty
to complete that monk's work.
The King has told me
a great deal about him.
I also desire
that Prudentius should teach
Judith to illuminate.
He is troubled by the idea.
PRUDENTIUS:
You are a Bishop of our Holy Church.
Surely you agree that
it would be immoral?
Well?
God...
saw fit to allow a former prostitute
to wash the limbs of his own son
when He was brought down
from the cross.
If He tolerated such a woman
touching the sacred flesh,
how much more would He
approve of a good and pious
Christian woman adorning
His sacred texts? Hmm?
Free.
UBBE:
We found Floki!
HVITSERK:
We have him!
UBBE:
We found him, Father!
The great Floki...
captured by mere children!
Why didn't the gods protect you?
Why didn't they hide you better
from such innocent eyes?
Could it be that the gods
were not interested in saving him?
Because they are angry at you.
Is there anything
you want to say to that?
I've said it all.
Bring him forward, please.
Ah-ah-ah.
You made me suffer...
And now, I shall make you suffer.
And I've got such a wonderful
punishment for you.
You'll probably appreciate it, too.
See, I borrowed it from the gods.
It's very imaginative.
And it goes on, and on, and on...
and on.
Nothing heroic.
No chance to impress the gods.
- MAN 1: Take him!
- MAN 2: Take him away!
Why are you still angry?
Because Floki still refuses
to admit why he did what he did!
But he's right.
Right?
What did he do that was wrong?
All he did was kill a Christian.
Why should he be punished
just for that?
This is not about Christians or faith!
- It's about loyalty.
-
- And trust!
-
Something you can't understand.

What took you so long?
What are you doing up here?
I am trying to dig a grave.
Can't you see?
For my daughter.
What did she die of?
Does it matter?
Have you told Floki?
No.
