Excuse me sir, do
you have a match?
Of course, I have a lighter.
Thank you. - You're welcome.
God be with you, soldiers!
- God be with you!
There, in that yellow house,
is where I lived with my aunt.
See the smoking chimney?
It's coming from her house.
I didn't! I swear on my aunt!
Stop! Police!
He's a thief!
He stole from me!
Leave! Go!
Easy.
Kill the thief!
Theif! - Fuck you!
- Take him to jail!
This is a serious business,
just like any other.
I won't stand for improvisations.
Look at you!
I've dressed you from head to toe.
You eat, sleep and play
in the best hotels.
And what do I get in return?
Especially you. - You said I
make 300%% % over the norm.
You recommended them.
Aces! Champs! Paganini!
Dad said they were.
- Return them to dad.
Don't worry, boss.
My fingers a just a bit rusty.
I haven't practised in 2 yrs.
You know how it is in jail.
No, I don't. I've never been
to jail and I never intend to.
I'd rather listen to this idiot,
at least I don't understand him.
The country is falling apart
and they are singing.
HOTEL BRISTOL
Come in!
Pardon the interruption. It'd be
wise to bring in your instruments.
There are many thieves about.
- Thanks for the warning.
Excuse me and good night.
- Good night.
Did you hear that, kids?
There are thieves about.
Put this in your bag and
turn off the light. It's late.
Look at all the people on the
streets. Spring has arrived.
Hello, reception? Is Mr Stojcic,
from 101 at breakfast?
Accompanied by a
lady with wavy hair.
He's left the hotel?
Thank you.
They stole my shoe.
What happened? - They stole
my shoe with the money in it!
Why didn't you put
it under your pillow?
Here's your key.
Be careful!
Watch out for my leg!
How much? - Apartment 101.
All together, 50.
Thank you. The key, please.
"...the attack was heroically
defended by our anti-aircraft
defence and aviation.
The government urges
all citizens not to panic.
The army is at full alert and will
not give the enemy an inch..."
What happened? - The Germans
have bombed Belgrade.
What did he say? - War.
- What? - War!
I can't hear you!
- The war's started, you deaf idiot!
Oh, war!
There's no more time.
Get a move on!
What are you doing, dad?
They'll be here any moment!
I have to take my brother.
- Get in the car!
Leave everything except
the "Gaugin"! Come on!
Djole, keep to the side roads!
If you use the main roads,
the army might take our car.
Good, the shutters are closed!
Wait! Stop!
The gentlefolk are running scared.
Should we get off here?
Thanks, old man.
- Good luck to you!
Now, it's your turn.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
You pig!
This war is great, isn't it?
Hey count, more champagne!
Come on, old man!
Where's that champagne?
Forget the champagne, you fool!
Get the gold and silver!
We have permits for all
directions to the south.
Look through the window, you oaf!
You'll see a red BMW.
For us smart people,
there is no war.
I'll write to you from Greece,
or maybe even America.
Shouldn't we take them along,
boss? They're so helpless.
Scram! I'm not a home for invalids!
Surround them!!
Colonel, allow me to explain.
Our passes are in order.
We're on a special mission.
This is our home. We're packing.
- What?
We're leaving.
- This is my brother's home!
I'll be the judge here!
Put me down,
I can't go any further.
I have no vacant apartments.
I hope this will suit you.
Where will we go, when this
bloodsucker kicks us out?
Don't you have any
relatives we could go to?
A brother or mother? Someone
must have given birth to you.
I don't have a mother.
My aunt gave birth to me.
I have an aunt in Stara Varos.
It's 2 hours by train.
We never seem able
to say good-bye.
Shall we try there?
You're kind, all of a sudden.
- Why would you invite us?
You're a sly one, Lily.
No man is safe with you.
We don't need her.
- We'll pass easier as a trio.
You're only men.
- I definitely am.
So, we're going?
Put it there!
Good night.
Do not worry, life takes care,
while there are people,
money is there.
What's your aunt like?
Will she take us in?
She's a failed musician.
Now she's a beach keeper,
but still a nice lady.
Who is it?
It's me.
- Which me? Go to hell!
Nice lady!
- It's me, Lily!
Here's a present, aunty.
- Stong, excellent, plum brandy.
You sound like... lt's you, Lily!
- It's me and I'm really tired.
Who are these two?
- They're my friends, musicians.
"...you are the pain in my heart..."
I'm only joking, ma'am.
They're from Belgrade, aunty.
- Come inside. Come on!
Bon appetite, Popeye.
Let's see what you can do.
Come on!
Get up, Pik.
- What is it?
Come on!
What is it?
- She wants us to play.
Good morning. - Good morning.
GERMANY IS VICTORIOUS
ON ALL FRONTS
Be careful, ma'am!
- I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
Spinach for this amount.
- There's not enough for 2 kg.
What? - It's not enough.
- That's highway robbery!
Are you buying or not?
- Weigh it first.
By order of the town's
German Commander,
we are now recruiting
for compulsary labour.
All unemployed men
between 18 and 60,
must report to the
German Command.
He asked if you'll dance with him.
Say you won't.
They're bombing us and we're
supposed to dance with them.
I don't want to make trouble.
One dance won't hurt.
What does he want?
- He wants me to sing for them.
Which song? - Lily Marlene.
- On one, two, three...
I won't sing! - Don't be crazy!
You know the Germans.
Well, will you start? - No.
Sing! - I don't know that song.
You should have learned it.
- I don't won't to.
I'll sing it for you.
Will you sing, or not?
No.
He's a fool!
They can do whatever they want.
Good on him, as long
as he doesn't give in.
My friend, in times
like these, heads fly!
Why didn't he sing?
He's paid to.
It's not that simple.
- There's something called pride.
Go and defend him!
They're beating him, go on!
Waiter! Are you deaf?
Aunty, why don't you join us?
- I'll never eat that!
Kid, pack your things and leave!
Sit down.
As soon as we finish our meal,
we'll be leaving.
Is it too spicy for you?
Stupid Krauts! They've left
their wagons unlocked.
Get in!
Faster!
Let's go!
Jump! - My leg! - Jump!
Jump! What are you waiting for?
I told you the town was fenced in,
but you wouldn't listen.
I thought... - Don't bullshit!
The only chance you have
is to play until this is over.
You'll play at my funeral.
I can't even lift my leg.
- That can be fatal.
Go on, Lily. He's so cute!
You despised her for dancing
with him, now you're forcing her.
I've been thinking about you.
- What do you mean?
I'll give Lily the houseboat key.
And? - Captain Dietrich can
spend the night with her.
What night?
- Night time is our time.
They've only just started.
- What? - In bed.
What's he been doing
till now? Let's go!
Take it easy, you'll kill him!
Are you crazy?
He needs artificial respiration.
He drank half the river.
He'll die because of your oar,
not the river.
Give him mouth-to-mouth,
while I massage him.
I can't kiss a man, you do it.
- I can't do it, forget it!
Do you think he'll remember us?
You don't forget such things.
We saved his life.
I expected a thank you note
and canned food.
Germans are usually precise.
He must have told someone.
All we need are the passes
so that we can leave.
There he is.
By order of the German Command,
because of the criminal attack
on a German miltary truck,
and the wounding of a soldier,
Is he looking? - Yes.
What do you think?
I know he's talking about us.
Lily's coming this way.
He said you're staring at him and
sending strange signals. - Us?
We saved him from drowning,
now he doesn't know us.
He didn't mention it.
I'll ask him.
You're insane!
What did we do?
- Now I understand everything.
Look, he's smiling.
He's smiling.
Dietrich remembers you saving
him, but no one must know.
Why? - He was on duty that night.
If they find out he left his post,
they'll send him
to the Russian Front,
and us to the camp.
So, keep your mouths shut!
He already thinks
you're suspicious.
Put another brandy on my tab.
He's alive. - Is he?
Are you Partisans? - No!
Partisans... attack... you.
Partisans... attack... you.
Understand?
We saved you from them.
I'm a Communist!
No, you stupid Kraut!
You're a fascist, we saved
you from the Partisans!
I'm a Communist! No, why...?
Wait. I'll try to explain it him.
Wait! Calm down!
Partisans... in woods.
How do you say woods
in German?
We... here... friends.
Understand?
Yes, my Communist brother.
Explain it to him.
- He's crazy!
One bandits... you head... bash...
...tell him. - That he knows.
...we helper... you!
Hitler is kaput!
Hitler is swine!
Fuck off!
I'm going to beat
the crap out of him!
Pik, where's my watch?
Where's my watch?
- It was there last night.
That damned Kraut stole it!
Your Doxa? - You idiot,
it was a Schaffhausen!
I can't believe he tricked me!
A soldier, yet scum!
A German soldier at that,
known for their discipline.
I spent 3 months in jail
because of that watch!
You want to achieve something?
They don't want Moscow or London,
all they want is my watch!
A great army, a great power?
I'll throw a bomb on your
warehouse or barracks!
Be quiet. - I won't,
they stole my watch!
Fuck the watch!
Watch your hide.
You'll remember Popeye!
An eye for an eye!
Shitheads!
Only idiots like you would
set fire to a full warehouse.
Who's that?
- A vampire.
Unlike fools, smart
people have 9 lives.
Coffee, sugar, flour, lard,
oil, ham and tobacco.
Don't worry, you'll get some.
Two more crates
and you're finished.
Don't! People are starving and
you want to burn it all down!
We could live a year on this!
These goods are
first class quality.
Get in, Lily!
I'm staying. - I'll be back.
Madame, help yourself.
What are you doing here,
enjoying yourselves?
How about helping those who
are fighting the war for you?
Dig the mines, instead of robbing
the Reich for the black market.
We're waiting for work
from the employment office.
I want you dressed and ready
at the gate in 3 minutes!
Go home! Scram!
Hey, you! Yes, you!
Come here!
Do you have a work permit?
- I'm the lifeguard here.
While Europe is in flames,
you're lounging in the shade.
Actually, I'm a musician.
We'll be playing on the terrace.
Are you going to get dressed
or go in those pants?
I can't believe how many
bums there are around here.
Hey, you! - I just have to
give my aunt her medicine.
Are you also a musician?
- No, I'm not.
You're not? - I am.
You are? - I am.
- So, you are? - No, I'm not.
Just let me take...
She can manage without you.
Go to the gate, immediately!
Sir, they're musicians,
artists. - Artists?
Educated people from Belgrade.
They're not for the mines.
Work in the mines will
be invigorating for them.
To the gate! Now!
Tell him it's a mistake!
We have nothing
to do with this!
This is not our war!
- Stop shitting in your pants!
You, and you, get out!
Over there.
There are rumours...
that the local population is
hostile towards our army.
Can there be a better example
that this is not true?
Proof of this, are these
brave Serbian citizens.
Once again, I thank them
and congratulate them.
"You are the pain in
my heart, all my desires.
When I die, your tiny
hand on my shoulder..."
Well ma'am,
we're here to stay.
Not only that, we're now
safe from the Germans.
All thanks to you. - I didn't
do anything. - Yes, you did.
Cheers!
A small present for you.
What is it?
- Silverware for 6.
Is it real silver?
- They're stamped.
I think you'll like it here.
- I think I will.
Have you seen the newspaper?
What is it? Let me see.
Hey, it's us! Look at me!
"Serbian citizens save German
soldier from bandits."
It turns out that we're with
the Germans, but we're not!
How are we going to explain
this? Look at you grinning!
I've never been
involved in politics.
I swore to my aunt
that I never would.
Who would have thought the
Krauts would publicise this?
What a pack of lies!
A pack of bandits!
Tears of joy because
we saved the milkman.
They say I made a speech.
I wasn't even listening
to their bullshit!
All I did was eat, drink and
think of how to get my watch.
What is it?
- What was that?
"Death to German collaborators!"
Where's your boyfriend?
The town is in chaos.
They're chasing allies.
Who?
They shot down an American
plane. The pilots parachuted.
The Krauts are raiding the town.
Someone's hiding them.
Dietrich is furious. - Forget
the pilots. Get out the cans.
Pilots? It couldn't have
happened at a better time.
I know who could... Max!
Who's Max?
- Max the Communist, a good man.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Max, I've lived here 40 years
and I know eveything.
Give us one American.
We need to hide him.
I know you have them.
Only you can hide them.
Listen, Max. They're accusing
us of being collaborators.
We have to prove
that we're not traitors.
No one suspects me. There's
plenty of space at the beach.
I was always for the Americans,
especially the air force.
We'll take care of him. - I don't
know what you're talking about.
All right then, I'll go and
get the German patrol.
If you're not hiding anyone,
you have nothing to fear.
Wait! - Wait! - You're
too late for the Americans.
I've already sent them
to a liberated zone.
If you really want
to prove yourselves,
I have someone for you.
- Allies? - Jews.
They've already been
sent to the camps.
That's all I have to offer.
You decide.
Go over there!
Sit there and wait!
What's your name? - Lea.
And yours? - Popeye.
Popeye the sailor man,
Lea's looking for him.
Popeye the crazy man,
put Lea into a bin.
Okay, go to sleep now.
- Tell me a story about Popeye.
Once upon a time, there
was a man named Popeye...
As a warning to anyone
disobeying orders of the
German Command and hides
Jews, Gypsies or Communists,
Maksim Stefanovic will be
executed by firing squad.
The sentence will be
carried out at once.
The 3 Jews found hiding in
the mill at Maksim Stevanovic,
will also be executed.
Colonel Joseph Muller.
May I speak?
Only if it concerns the
Jewish girl. - Yes.
He might betray us.
Where is she?
- In a safe place.
If they find her, we're done for.
They'll look everywhere.
Let someone else look after her.
- The girl stays with us.
Run, Pik!
We have to leave
as soon as possible.
Where? How?
- I don't know.
Don't worry, you can stay.
We're leaving.
Damn you! You're leaving just
as I was getting used to you.
I'll be on my own again.
Lily went to Captain Dietrich
to ask for the passes.
As an orchestra, we can
travel throughout Serbia.
Why didn't you say anything?
- Why? The chances are slim.
I'm offering you a chance.
- Here's your vampire again.
You brute!
You almost killed me!
What are you staring at?
I have a proposition. - Get lost!
Wait! Maybe he can
help us get out of here.
I've seen many Kraut warehouses,
but this one is special.
It's packed to the brim.
- So what?
I can see you want to clear out.
I also have to leave.
We clear out the warehouse, trade
the goods, then straight to Greece.
How do we get out of here?
We trade the goods for gold,
and the gold for documents.
I'm offering you a chance.
What if there's shooting again?
You know I plan
everything in style.
Can I get out of this stove?
Hey, are you listening?
Listen child,
we're going on a trip.
What have you got?
- Three of a kind.
You're better!
I've got two pairs.
Someone's coming, hide!
Get the instruments!
Are you inside? - Yes.
What is it? - Germans!
- We're being chased!
I hope they didn't recognise us!
What are we going to play?
- "The Stars Are Echoing".
What did he say?
He'll give us the passes
after tomorrow's performance.
I don't want to hide anymore!
- Scram! - Don't yell at her!
Let's get out of here!
Why? Tomorrow at the ball,
we'll play a song or two, then go.
How many guests will there be?
- It's the Commander's birthday.
There'll be officers and those
who are in with the Germans.
Ladies and gentlemen.
That means jewellery, rings,
necklaces. We're staying!
No one has died here
in the last twenty years!
But they might!
Whoever moves,
I'll be reading their requiem!
Bosko!
You're in with the Germans!
- What are you talking about?
Traitors, scum!
- We're not traitors!
You'll have to prove it!
Lea, come out!
- No, I'm afraid!
Who's the gentleman?
- He's a waiter.
He wasted a German,
then escaped to the woods.
It's worse here than in the corso!
People always going in and out!
Can I speak freely
in front of him?
I'm not into politics.
My field is finance.
You're playing tomorrow night?
- That's the deal.
We get the passes, then leave.
- What do you want to say?
We want to set explosives here,
to make the ball really great.
Here? - Where are we to go?
- We're leaving tomorrow.
You're not going anywhere!
Understood?
Could you get me across the river?
I'd go to my sister, up north.
If there's space, I'd also go.
We'd help your movement
from the background.
Whatever is needed in secret,
we're here.
We are thieves.
- Speak for yourselves!
All right.
You help me place the
explosives under the terrace,
I'll take you across the river.
How, if you blow us up.
We play on that terrace.
When you stop playing,
you'll have 4 minutes to get away.
That's the length of the fuse.
Be careful, only 4 minutes.
Go straight to the boat,
I'll be waiting.
Bosko, we have to discuss this.
- We'll see.
He wants us to continue playing.
Sir, the music is kaput.
Can we have the passes, please?
Nobody move!
Run! Run!
Popeye, push the boat!
Push it now!
Tell me about Popeye again.
Once upon a time,
there was a man named Popeye.
What did he eat?
Spinach.
What was he like?
He was the best and the strongest!
Who did he love?
Who did he love? -You.
-At long last, you said it.
