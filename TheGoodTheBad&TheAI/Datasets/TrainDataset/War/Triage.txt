Wonderful right? This place is wonderful.
Did you know?
Only in the course of my life
We had eight wars.
Two of the Turks,
three with the Iranians
And three with the Iraqis.
And if I go back to when he was alive
my father or my father's father,
Each time they were defeated.
It's what we do best.
Be defeated.
Why left?
Where should I go, Mr. Walsh?
They talk of free will,
but we are only pigeons.
It's better games
she and her friend.
Offensive L 'will begin two days

We do not want go.
We are here for, sir.
Can you do two places?
Nothing stops it.
I have to go.
I'll see if I can do something.
Thank you.

It is ideal for an ambush.
We have two positions on the truck.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes
Let them and return back here
we took a jeep to the border
And we in Turkey in the evening.
What do you think?
- This very tight.
- Why?
Be home no later than Wednesday.
Ten days before
the baby is born.
I really do not understand?
So many children are born
prematurely.
and if the Iraqis
implement a counter?
Is not gonna happen. Take weeks
to return to the mountains.
What do you know?
Saddam does not care
none of the Kurds.
Back on the mountain
demonstration purposes only.
To slaughter them.
Only interested in oil.
Program:
We recover the deposits.
Recovery?
Nor have they taken so far.
And if I do? What?
You are doing everything difficult.
We've been here almost a month, right?
Yes.
We have some photos
Dr. Talzani, triage.
Children greet
Rebel flag
And the trains Peshmerga.
- It is a good material.
- Yes, but not what we want.
We have no history.
Yes, the offensive Kurdistan
go on the front pages.
We are just photographers.
We can not lose shots.
Come on.
Yes I think so.
Welcome back. How did it go?
- Great.
- Which team are you?.
Photo of the offense?.
- No, we have students.
- Okay, I understand!
Only two more days.
- Do you know what's the worst?
- What?
The food they are forced to eat.
Watch these grains.
Why war
Food is always shit?
And then, Scottish
cook what you mean.
Ah, again.
Their menu is
cooked in a war zone.
This is what your child eats for life
if we get decent photos.
You're worse than a pit bull.
Never give up.
Can anyone say no?
We hope that in a war in France.
Good food, close to home.
But knowing that the French
end in a week.
After this service
I want to go to fashion.
Two more days. Not one more.
If you try to say "Just another ..."
Go! Without hesitation.
No way.
Very good.
Bravo. You do not have manners.
That's incredible.
I've fooled again.
Mark!
Where you going?
- What happened? - Come on.
- At the base? - No. We are going to Iraq.
- For the brave Iraqis? - Yes
- Okay.
How are you?
What was the slaughter?
I can not endure
to make this work.
There 's a change of plans.
They attack the fort.
They want to share
a convoy of trucks.
And you too? No!
- We have no choice. Bailamos.
- And we dance?
We have no choice?
Did you unzipped the brains?
Just another day, then another
and another! Do not take it anymore!
I'm going home.

What makes you walk backwards?
Are 32 miles to the base.
Do not you understand?
Whatever.
, David!

Wow! David!
Mr. Walsh! Come!
Mr. Walsh?
L 'have been found in the River.
Can you remember?
He says he can not walk.
Y 'as well?
I woke up.
- Does it hurt?
- .
- So, do you hear?
- Yes
No pain?
It can move your arms?
The legs?
Very good.
Even a head injury?
Area E '. Perhaps a slight
emotion, but no fractures.
Kurdistan is not the ideal place
for a fractured skull.
Therefore.
Shot I was strong,
But he is not paralyzed.
There is no broken bone.
The legs are the problem
larger. And always.
Legs, legs, legs.
For each arm
I had to amputate
I amputee ... ten legs.
Strange, no?
The human legs are not created
for modern warfare.
Do not worry. Rest.
Do you have any problems neuronal
But Inshallah
is only temporary.
I afloat.
How do you feel?
Wow.
I was scared.
Best. A little pain.
Excellent. Pain
the numbness is preferable.
It's very fortunate.
If there are complications ...
What? I would have killed?
Sure. For your own sake.
To end the suffering.
Where s your friend?
Do not come to see her.
I do not know I'm here.
When it came it was gone.
The first day of the offensive.
Smart man.
Men of War
believe they are immortal.
It is not good for morale to see
Cave Hara dying colleague.
I have not found another.
I hope you are well.
Oh, Mr. Walsh.
Is progressing.
What do you think?
How many doctors are in the world,
have to clean a weapon?
- You should also sterile.
- Oh, the sarcasm is back.
Good.
You must have many regrets.
Remorse for what?
Because he saved me
days of excruciating pain?
As there was no way to save
or alleviate the tremendous pain of these?
Do you think that killing men
me joy?
Of course not.
During quieter
When there are many
the fight and I have more time
Little blue check code.
However, in critical moments,
many wounded who arrive, no.
I have to be alone
still be saved.
, please.
Some live, some die.
The only way to see it.
Spa .
Everything else is just supposition.
Presumption Cards

Course, this is reprehensible
medical school.
Smoke in the operating room.
Tonight will be smooth.
You know what I mean Peshmerga?
This means:
Those who face death.
Romance.
Even poetic.
I do not always choose

Limit to everyone.
There 's a van part
morning at the border.
Why?
Negotiated the offensive.
He's agreed to go,
so far.
Ready to start?
Yes.
It is much better.
I think it is yours.
, I do not.
I hope your stay
was nice.
A journey of a fable.
I do not understand why
there are more tourists here.
Sorry. E 'typical of us Kurds.
It is a matter of honor insurance
that foreigners are happy.
I consider myself a satisfied customer.
Dr. Talzani!
Thanks, really.
The pleasure was mine, Mr. Walsh.
Good luck.
Ah!
Me.
Oh!
Piano, piano!

But it is curious.
Mark makes no mention of David.
It does not seem strange?
I do not know. Even to me it seems different.
Concerned.
And then more and more lame.
He says no, but ... .
And tonight you know that I said?
He wants a son to me.
- A son?
- Yes
Mark wants a child?
It is very bad!
Sorry. Sorry, Diane.

He has performed in neurology.
He wiped his head wound
and removed a foreign body.
Do not go. Can you explain?
I can not tell. Ask the disease.
Sorry.
- Can you tell me what your legs?
- I suspect a neurological problem.
You see the neurologist
answer all your questions.
Wait a few minutes.
The good news is that
no permanent damage.
Physically
Compromise Nothing, fortunately.
No neurological disorder
no broken bones.

hypersensitive along the spine,
Classic symptoms of trauma

So, worst?
He said he fell into a river
and hit the rocks.
- He said, too?
- Yes
But I have some doubts.
We have drawn this page
on the back of the skull.
Composition: alloy steel
and cadmium, with traces of TNT,
Features: 3 mm,
serrate, curved on both sides,
And it gives a load of metal
very severe and sudden.
A splinter.
I think that Mark has been
near death, no.
A grenade exploded insurance
a few feet away.
E 'so that is injured.
But this is not the problem.
Is there any medical condition
and physical properties of a net improvement.
On the contrary, is getting worse.
Mean?
A psychosomatic complications.
Perhaps a complaint
posttraumatic stress disorder.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I think you need.
Why do not you tell me

It was easier to talk.
Easier?
Yes.
You worry so much,

Grandpa, are you there?
It's me, Elena.
Body of children mutilated.
Law and '?
This test does not exist
right or wrong.
The following.
Ah, again.
Maimed woman's body.
body of a man maimed.
This was the father.
They captured the whole family.
What bad luck!
For her it is all a game?
I do not know. And it seems all so ...
Stupid, you know?
Maybe I was.
But I'm trying to help.
And soon I will go and I will be paid
What she responds
my questions or not.
And she will stay here
unable to walk.
It is important to understand that stupidity
can take many forms.
It has never been in a war zone?
No..
However, I have had patients
was.
No offense, but I do not think
is the same thing.
No. Is not it the same.
Then we can understand only
experience?
Only those who have been raped can give
advise the victim of a rape?
Maybe.
SOLO DA
I did not know Mark
had published a book.
I think I can help?
Of course I can.
I can help anyone.
As I said last night
between us, nothing will change.
I wanted to come
only to help.
Why has it become so difficult,
so critical?
Oh ..
Is always wrong
have some opinions?
As for the Nazis,
or the actions of Stalin?
- What have you done?
- And what do you think?
Sorry, I ...
No, this time I want to talk about it.
I've always refused
the possibility of confrontation.
You've come to know what I did
You got your idea
, and have closed the case.
What will it cost
again, you ask?
You are the only person
I have in the world.
Come on, tell me
What I can do that was so horrible?
I was his patient
war criminals. Monsters.
They have razed villages
and people tortured to death
All in the name of Spain
Franco.
And when I left you
Configure acquitted
of all their sins.
Has purified.
You also
adjusted well, right?
Very effective.
Impact D '.
Morales Institute
Purification psychologically.
Thousands of innocent
massacred, exterminated.
And when his murderers
was to blame
You and you said:
Do not worry, I had no choice.
It is with his life.
The men were taken by me
the "monsters" as they are called,
Because they lost.
They carried me
as a last hope
And yes, I have purified
I have no regrets. To you is simple.
They were bad men, and from
I took care of me too badly.
But you forget one thing.
They were men who had won,
Luckily, both
of Spain in your hands
And he had tasted power.
And what is the highest power
a man can have?
That will kill them.
And if you have thousands of dead,
What changes would kill others?
If a person has tortured
difficult torturing another?
No. It's easy.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
That was to keep people
punch in our country.
What would I do?
Turn left at the loss,
to make them continue to kill?
No. It would never have allowed.
And then I have been purified. Many.
Tome and brought back to life
Then mankind.
Want to know
how I saved?
I saved several.
Now you know how things are.
Also what you want.
However, r is no longer a teenager.
The world is very complex.
There are few things
that are either black or white.
Oh, then we are not sleeping.
How do you feel?
Good.
Magnificent.
What time is it?
It is time to start.
Beyond that, who knows?
Elena called Leri
He spoke of their difficulties
And I asked her out.
I answered: Well.
I was hesitant because now
no more army for several years.
Sorry, said Elena?
I am Joaquin Morales
Elena's grandfather.
Carmen, his mother tells me
often of his adventures.
Now, finally
We know
It's a shame
that in these circumstances.
I guess you heard
much of me.
I knew it had closed relations
years, he was a fascist.
I am a fascist?
It has a fertile imagination.
Wow, this talk
being diverted
the real reason for my coming.
First, I want to do
quick medical history,
Obviously, if you
has nothing against that.
I have no choice.
- Age?
- 34.
The parents are alive?
My father
is dead and my mother lives in London.
- Brothers or sisters?
- No.
Well, then get started.
Is that it?
What?
I thought that psychiatrists
a lot of questions on children,
In those experiences, those relationships.
It is not necessary. Exotic.
You're not a psychiatrist, right?
In truth, I prefer to define
a student of the human soul.
Suggestive.
- Tells the story of the war.
- What?
A history of the war.
Will undoubtedly have many
but the first thing that comes to mind.
There is a bit too early
for one of those?
Really?
I do not know if the family
recovered his body.
Why this event
problems, in your opinion?
I do not know.
I felt responsible.
Then, if she had not been there,
not escape.
The soldiers did not shoot. MH?
I guess so.
All of this makes sense.
Do you feel responsible for this death
partly because in reality.
Do you think it is too difficult?
For those who told this story?
Four? Three? Two? Twenty?
What do you say?
Oh, do not blame you.
Oh, no, it was not your fault.
I could not do anything.
Do I have reason?
You tried
forgiveness, in others
But then he realized that this is something
anyone can give.
We can not get rid of pain,
We took with us forever.
That means live.
Now I live alone with the pain.
Look at me.
I have 86 years.
I lost my whole family.
I lost my parents.
I lost my brothers and sisters
and I've lost my wife.
However, I'm still here.
I can still smile, and the world
remains a wonderful place.
Ah.
Elena will be here soon.
Tell him I'll be at the hotel.
Oh, by the. She knows that her
is the so-called sleep of children?
No movement, no wrinkle
face as a child.
A good sign, right?
No..
When stirred
and talk in your sleep
It means that the problem
is no longer latent.
But the serenity of an adult male
not a good sign.
Thank you.
-  Bye.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
- See you at home.
- Claro.
Twelve, thirteen,
fourteen ...
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.
Excellent.
It's almost back to normal.
Liar. I move
with less grace than her.
Wonderful!
A sense of humor is always
The last ability to recover.
Was the trade.
The Red Cross in Kurdistan
They are found in a search for a hotel
David Staff. A Rawa ...
Rawanduz.
Yes.
It is a small town in the north.
It was our base.
Did not you
who had gone south?
I do not know. He was heading south
and had to return to Rawanduz.
But then came the opportunity
and went to Turkey.
Still there  their stuff.
His clothes, everything.
Very good. Know someone
we call?
I do not know.
- Think! Will anyone.
- Do not know.
Without Seve at this time.
It is not helpful.
What am I to Diane?
My God, what?
I go to it. Call
If you can think of something.
I'm afraid I do not understand.
My best friend, David ...
We went together in Kurdistan
and then we parted.
- Had arrived a week ago.
- What do you care?
Fairly, yes.
His wife will give birth
a few days.
But he is a conservative.
It is not the first time
that one of us a lot in return.
Hmm. And it's a war zone
Obviously easy
there are delays.
I do not think that should
worry, let it go.
The most important thing
is to focus on his therapy.
Here, in this sense,
I know little or nothing
in terms of geography of Kurdistan.
Area L 'is divided
by the British, right?
Yes.
Whenever there
a casino in the world
It is always thanks to them or French.
Look, why not draw
