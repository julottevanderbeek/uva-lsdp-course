You all right?
Well, I think your partner over
there bought it.
Can you get your shovel out?
Come on, Pike,
you can do it.
You understand me?
How you doing, Pike?
So far, so good.
Oh, fuck.
Keep moving.
I'm dead.
Look, I'm not waiting
for someone to show up.
Keep going!
A compass, something?
The world is so
beautiful, Losey, isn't it?
I'm okay;
don't worry about me.
They're lost too.
Uh-uh.
Hey.
I'll be I can stay
down longer than you.
On your feet,
soldier.
You find anything?
And start walking.
Don't say I never
gave you nothing, sad sack.
Pretty stripped.
Well, at least
they were close to God.
Man, and its hero
the conqueror worm."
and I had to have my teacher
explain it to me.
All little boys are pyros.
Ahh!
No, stop!
We'll tie him up,
and we'll look around.
All right, you first.
Hey, quit your
squawking, and keep on walking.
Better tell him no snacks.
Eyes open,
mouth shut.
I love you.
Of course I'll marry you.
Now things are back
the way they should be.
Let's go
find our man-eater.
Where'd you come from, huh?
Hey, help me up.
Whoa, whoa.
Fucker's shot to shit,
though, isn't it?
I'm going there.
Okay.
Four-star hotel.
I will never leave you.
Come here.
Something beautiful.
I don't even know
if it was there.
Yelling my name,
begging me to fuck her.
You ever had horse meat,
Losey?
Kid, we got company.
He's got a rifle.
Shit.
Don't panic yet.
Let's move.
Deming,
take it easy.
Ah!
Take all of it off.
Down, down.
I promise you.
I'll never leave you.
There will
be a show.
We don't even know where we are.
With the respect
that you deserve!
Wait.
American.
They all look
a little fucked up.
Asshole!
No, daddy, leave me alone.
Man, and its hero
the conqueror worm."
Oh!
Ow!
I'll fight.
Cut me loose!
We can't run anymore.
Upstairs.
Oh, shit.
So now the Krauts
have tracked you here.
Hurry!
Get under there,
quick.
Why don't they
just storm the place?
We'll take care of it.
Smoke!
I'm coming with you.
How long can you
hold your breath?
Shit.
Get down.
I'll go find him.
No.
Five minutes to decide
if you live or die.
The time has come.
I hope that you are hearing me
and understanding.
Four minutes.
This place
is rubble.
I'm real glad that asshole
can tell time.
It's just grown-ups
playing a game.
Ah!
Oh!
Stupid old fucker.
Was?
Das ist ein Kind gewesen?
Just go!
You.
You're beautiful.
Death is coming.
Here they come; here they come.
Yes!
This is it, motherfucker;
this is it!
I'm out!
I'm out!
Keep your head down.
Downstairs, now!
I got to have more ammo!
Deming, where are you?
Ah!
Move it;
move it.
Ah!
Uhh.
Ah!
Come on.
No!
They think this war is a game.
Yeah.
Follow it to the woods;
you'll make it.
Who I am.
I'll make it.
Quit squawking,
and start walking.
Go!
Come on.
Ahh!
Come and get me!
She's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
If you just look at it right.
I'll never leave you.
