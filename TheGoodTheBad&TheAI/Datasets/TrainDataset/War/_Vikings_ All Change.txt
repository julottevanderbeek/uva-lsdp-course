Previously on "Vikings":
We shall ask the gods
why do they make me earl,
yet kill my son?
- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?
Fill me with seed
before it's too late.
If you really want
to be a great man,
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?
That's where your brother is.
He's already boasting
how he sailed west alone.
But you weren't invited.
You didn't even know about it.
King Horik: There is a Jarl
in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.
He continues to claim he has legal
rights over some of my land.
And now, once again,
he's making threatening noises.
How can I be of help?
Travel to Gotaland
as my emissary?
I shall be forever
in your debt.
Please stay.
Ragnar: Lord of lords,
who will bear me my son?
More, give me more
Give me more
If I had a heart
I could love you
If I had a voice
I would sing
After the night
when I wake up
I'll see
what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
If I had a voice
I would sing

Jarl Borg: Send a rider tonight
and he'll be back by morning.
Floki: Why don't they let us
dry ourselves and get warm?
If I stay like this,
I will rust.
Rollo: What kind of
fellow is this Jarl Borg?
This is no way to treat guests,
whoever they are.
Arne: Especially if they've
been traveling for days on end.
Jarl Borg: Are you the
emissaries from King Horik?
Well, I can tell you at once you're
wasting your time. It's my land--
and I want it returned to me.
That's all I have to say.
Ragnar: He wants to
make peace with you
and come to some kind of
agreement.
Then tell him if he leaves
my land, we can have peace.
But not before.
How can you make peace,
Jarl Borg,
if you insist on
humiliating him?
Jarl Borg:
If I invade and defeat him,
will he not be
even more humiliated?
Ragnar:
Not if he fights well.
In any case,
I am sure that
he would relish a fight.
What's your name?
Ragnar Lothbrok.
You are Ragnar Lothbrok,
the one who sailed west?
I am surprised that
you've heard about that.
How are you surprised?
Everyone has heard
of your exploits.
Why have we not offered our
guests dry clothes and food?
Treat these folk well.
Give them ale, let them
dry out, feed them.
Tomorrow,
you and I will talk again,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
Gyda: You haven't
eaten in three days.
You see?
I have fears.
Siggy:
Go to the Seer,
ask if your fears
will come true.
It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.
Jarl Borg: I take it, from
what you said yesterday,
that King Horik is
prepared to compromise
and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,
which he still occupies?
He is prepared to pay you
to renounce your illegal claims
of his lands.
Jarl Borg: You disappoint
me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.
I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.
- If you would just name your price.
- Jarl Borg: The land is priceless,
which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.
Rollo: Every piece
of land has a price,
just like every human.
Jarl Borg:
Well, you don't understand.
This is not a small plot of land on
which to grow turnips and onions.
We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,
and on this land,
in the earth, are minerals,
things of great value.
Why else would I assert
my claim?
Ragnar:
King Horik resists your claim,
but still, in good faith,
he is willing
to settle with you.
Rollo: If you will name
a reasonable price.
At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.
Ragnar: Well then,
it seems I am done.
Jarl Borg: Hold on, please,
sit down, sit down.
Let's see if we can find
another way.
What do you have in mind?
What if my claim
was acknowledged
but I was willing to lease the land
back to the king during his lifetime?
Or what if we deferred judgment
on ownership,
but shared the mineral rights?
What do you say,
can we start negotiating
in this manner?
Why not?
Ragnar: I have not been
given the authority to...
negotiate in this manner.
You mean King Horik sent you
here with nothing but a demand?
And yet he speaks of peace!
I don't know
what is in his mind.
Jarl Borg: Well then,
maybe you should ask him.
Jarl Borg:
Let me make a suggestion:
Why don't you send
one of your men back
so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy.
If you think that will work.
Jarl Borg: Good. Your messenger
will take several days.
So, in the meantime, why don't you and
your men go and visit our famous ash tree?
It is famous not only for its size but
because it never loses its leaves,
summer or winter.
Some people even say
it's Yggdrasil,
the tree that holds up the sky.
And I will provide you
an escort.
I only have one,
very small request.
I would like one of your men to stay
behind here as a kind of security.
You understand, I hope?
My brother Rollo
will stay behind.
Ragnar:
Floki!
Bjorn:
So how long must we travel?
Guide: It can take us three
days to reach the tree.
It looks like rain.
Come.
Seer:
Why have you come?
Lagertha:
I am frightened for my husband.
Seer: Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?
I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.
What happens in your dreams?
Lagertha: Dark shapes
come to me at night.
Monstrous forms.
When I wake,
they skulk in the shadows,
shapeless,
but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.
Seer:
Ah, yes.
The shadows come from
hell's hall.
No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.
Lagertha:
What is it that they want?
To take something from you.
My life?
Seer: No, something far more
important to you than that.
My husband's life?
Tell me.
Seer: Why must you
all force me up
and unearth me to sorrows?
Your husband is in danger,
but not for his life.
He is in danger
from the magical world.
How?
Answer me.
Seer: I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!
So, Rollo,
how do you get on
with your brother?
We get along fine.
Why shouldn't we?
No reason.
But not all brothers
get on so well.
I know that
from personal experience.
What do you mean?
I too had a brother.
I loved him.
We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.
We fought together
in the shield-wall.
We shared the same women.
When my father was killed, there was
fierce competition to replace him as jarl.
And although
I was his eldest son
I was not sure
I was going to succeed.
However, I was elected
at the thing.
We had a feast to celebrate.
My wife was there...
my young, beautiful wife -
we'd just gotten married -
and all the others who had stood
for election against me.
My brother poisoned them...
all.
I only survived because...
my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from
and drained it herself
in celebration.
I will never forget
her screams.
It's my wife's screams that will
haunt me for the rest of my life.
My brother denied
responsibility,
but his guilt was too obvious.
So I blinded him
with my own hands,
and then I burned him alive.
That's what I know about
the love between brothers.
Ragnar...
would never do such a thing.
Of course not.
No, your brother is different.
Your brother's a great man,
a great warrior.
As am I.
I'm sure you are.
And yet I've never heard
of you.
Nils:
Whoa...
Our camp is set up over here.
There's some excellent fishing,
upstream, under the waterfall.
I will go.
And I also,
for everybody knows...
- Three eyes are be.
- Ugh!
Servant 1:
You! Look away!
- Servant 2: Who are you?
- Servant 1: Look away at once!
What are we suppose
to be looking at?
Arne: I'm blind! See?!
I can't see anything!
Agh!
Agh!
Arne:
Torstein: Arne!
Servant 1: What? You're
going to try to kill us
for protecting the reputation
of our mistress?
Ha! Shame on you!
Arne: We came upon your
mistress by chance.
We are strangers here,
traveling to the great ash
tree, guests of Jarl Borg.
Servant 1: Jarl Borg? Then why
didn't you say so at once?
Torstein: We will just
return to our horses then.
You spied on me.
We meant no harm.
Servant 1: They say they
are guests of Jarl Borg.
Are you alone?
We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.
Then I think that Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.
Don't you?
Ragnar: I never knew that
fresh fish was also
packed in salt.
Listen, it's not our fault.
We just saw her bathing.
What were we supposed to do?
Fish.
You did not see her, Ragnar.
So you get your cheek slashed
and now I'm supposed
to apologize
for you two staring
at a naked body.
That's what she said.
Who is she, anyway, to put such
a high price on her nakedness?
We didn't ask.
I'm intrigued.
What's so intriguing?
Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us
as some kind of test.
She has set me a challenge
and I am up to task.
See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,
than what I suspect is her wit.
So tell her
I invite her here to join us...
Neither dressed
nor undressed.
What else?
Neither hungry
nor full,
neither in company
nor alone.
Can you remember all of that,
one eye?
Siggy:
What did the Seer tell you?
He said that it's true;
That Ragnar is in danger.
From whom?
I don't know.
Who do you think?
I think he is in danger
from himself.
Man: Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?
Man 2:
No.
Young woman: So, Earl Ragnar,
I come to you as you desired:
Neither dressed nor undressed,
neither hungry nor full,
neither alone...
nor yet in company.
Do I pass your test?
I owe you an apology.
I accept.
Could I offer you some,
uh, horrible salted fish?
I'm very tempted.
You can get tired
of fresh fish.
Come.
Sit, please.
May I ask your name?
My name is Aslaug.
We're on our way to see
the great ash tree.
Of course.
You are welcome to join us.
Will you come along, Aslaug?
Siggy:
- Siggy, what is it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.
Oh, I visited my cousin
a few days ago.
She had just buried
her young son.
Why did he die?
One day he was fine,
and the next he
caught a fever that
made him sweat and cry out in
the night, and the next day...
she put him in the ground.
Siggy:
Bjorn:
But if it is Yggdrasil,
then it must be the same tree
that Lord Odin
once hanged himself from.
Aslaug:
Why not?
All things are possible.
Ragnar: "I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,
wounded by a spear,
dedicated to Odin,
from that tree of which
no man knows
from where its roots run."
No, please...
Look after my daughter...
First.
Athelstan:
It's all right.
Arne:
What's wrong, boy?
What do you think?
My father is making
a fool of himself.
Arne: He's enjoying himself in the
company of a beautiful woman.
What's foolish about that?
Some day you'll do
the same thing.
If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.
Arne:
Then it's a good
thing she's not.
Listen to me, my friend.
Your father and mother
are a famous couple.
They love each other.
Everybody knows that.
So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?
Jarl Borg: I trust all
is to your satisfaction.
You feed me very well.
Jarl Borg:
You're an important guest.
We would like to keep you entertained
until your brother returns.
You always talk
about my brother.
What choice do I have?
He is your earl.
Which one would you like
tonight?
Why don't you take
both of them?
I don't need to be bribed
with women.
What is it you want, Rollo?
What is it you really want?
Floki:
Fenrir, the giant wolf,
could not be constrained
by any means known to man,
so the dwarves forged a chain,
but not from metal.
Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,
so they forged it
from the things we cannot see
and the things we cannot hear.
Like the breath of a fish...
the sound a moving cat makes.
The roots...
of a mountain.
You know?
Of course I know!
These things interest me!
I came to ask about Jarl Borg.
He won't sell.
He wants to make a deal.
King Horik:
I'm not interested in deals.
That would make it hard
for Ragnar.
King Horik: Ragnar will come
to the right conclusion,
and make the right decision.
Don't you care
if the negotiations fail?
Mm...
Look!
I am going to die.
No,
you are not going to die.
The Seer might think that he
is the only one in Kattegat
with the gift of prophecy,
but he's wrong,
and I know you are not
going to die.
Aslaug: I should tell you the
truth about who I really am.
I am Princess Aslaug.
My mother was
the shield-maiden Brunhilde.
Everyone knows the
renown of your mother.
But I am not her.
I am myself.
Both my parents are dead now,
and I did not know them anyway.
Why did you come along with me?
Because I had no choice.
Hmm...
Why did you do that?
Because I had no choice.
Bjorn:
I hate you.
It's disgusting.
I could not help myself.
Shall I tell that to Lagertha,
your wife?
If you want to.
You cannot love her that much
after all,
no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.
I don't care what people think.
Of course I love your mother.
Bjorn: Swear to me that
it will not happen again.
I swear to you
it won't happen again.
I love you.
Now, go play.
Man:
Unnngh!
Siggy:
No!
No!
No!
Athelstan?
He is so weak
he cannot eat.
Pray to the gods,
please, for him.
Ragnar:
Wait, no.
I said no.
No.
Lagertha:
Lord of lords...
we make this offering to you,
hoping you will
find it pleasing.
Woman:
Can you try a little more?
Gyda...
Torstein:
Enjoy!
Arne:
What's wrong with you?
I'm carrying your child.
Did the Seer not
promise you more sons?
Whoa...
Jarl Borg: We welcome our
guests to this feast.
Now tell us what you learned
from King Horik?
What compromises
is he willing to make?
Floki:
Can I not eat first?
Well, he said...
What did he say?
Floki:
What did he say?
He will make no compromises,
no deals.
He say you must name
your price for the land.
Or?
He didn't say "or."
It seems your mission
has been entirely wasted,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
You and your men must leave here
in the morning.
Unless you want to repudiate
King Horik,
renounce your allegiance
to him.
Jarl Borg:
I see.
Very well.
Good.
War.
Odin...
So, my friend, the die is cast.
King Horik has left me
no choice.
I must attack him and claim
what is rightfully mine.
Your brother will clearly not
support me, but the question is,
will you?
Will you fight alongside me?
Together, you and I can
carve out the new kingdom.
Jarl Borg: Isn't that
what you really want?
The death of your brother
and the start of your own fame?
Well, what do you say?
I say yes.
I will fight with you.
I will fight with you
against my brother.
