I shall tell you
of William Wallace.
Historians from England
will say lam a liar,
but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.
The king of Scotland
had died without a son,
and the king of England,
a cruel pagan known
as Edward the Longshanks,
claimed the throne of Scotland
for himself.
Scotland's nobles
fought him
and fought each other
over the crown.
So Longshanks invited them
to talks of truce--
no weapons,
one page only.
Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,
a commoner
with his own lands.
He had two sons--
John and William.
I told you to stay.
Well,
I finished my work.
Where are we going?
MacAndrews'.
He was supposed to visit
when the gathering
was over,
- Can I come?
- No, go home, boy.
But I want to go.
Go home or you'll feel
the back of my hand.
Go you home,
William.
MacAndrews!
MacAndrews!
HolyJesus.
Aah!
It's all right!
William!
William!
William, it's all right.
It's all right.
Easy, lad.
William.
Uhh!
And I say
we hit back now!
We cannot fight them!
It's suicide!
We fight them!
Every nobleman who had
a will to fight
was at that meeting.
We cannot beat
an army.
Not with 50 farmers.
We do not have
to beat them, just fight them.
Now, who's with me?
I am, Wallace.
All right, all right.
Ready.
Where do you think
you're going?
I'm going with you.
Ah, you're going
with me, are you?
And what are you
going to do?
I'm going to help.
Hey, and a good help
you'd be, too,
but I need you
to stay here
and look
after the place for me
while I'm away.
I can fight.
I know.
I know
you can fight.
But it's our wits
that make us men.
See you tomorrow.
English.
Get down.
With your father
and brother gone,
they'll kill us
and burn the farm.
It's up to us, Hamish.
Nah.
Uhh!
Uhh. Ahh.
Da?
Da?
William.
Come here, lad.
Amen.
Amen.
William.
I'm your uncle.
Argyle.
You have the look
of your mother.
Mmm.
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow you'll
come home with me.
I don't want to leave.
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?
But it happened.
Did the priest give
a poetic benediction?
"The Lord bless thee
and keep thee"?
It was in Latin.
You don't speak Latin?
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?
The Lord
bless thee and keep thee.
The Lord cause His light
to shine on thee.
The Lord liftup
His countenance upon thee
and give thee peace.
Amen.
Your heart is free.
Have the courage
to follow it.
What are they doing?
Saying good-bye
in their own way--
playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.
It was the same for me
and your daddy
when our father
was killed.
First, learn to use...
this.
Then I'll teach you
to use...
this.
Manyyears la ter,
Edward the Longshanks,
King ofEngland,
sup ervisedthe wedding
ofhis eldestson,
wh o wo uld succeedhim
to the throne.
Amen.
Asbride forhis son,
Longshanks hadchosen
the da ugh terofhis rival,
the king ofFrance.
It was widely whisp eredthat
fortheprin cess to conceive,
Longshanks wo uld have to do
the honors himself.
That may have been
what he hadin mindall along.
Scotland... my land.
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,
but how will they
believe our strength
when we cannot rule
the whole ofour own island?
Where is my son?
Your pardon, milord.
He asked me
to come in his stead.
I sent for him,
and he sends you.
Shall I leave, milord?
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,
then, by all means,
stay and learn how.
Please.
Nobles.
Nobles are the key
to the door ofScotland.
Grant our nobles
lands in the north,
give their nobles
estates here in England,
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.
But, sire, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.
New lands
mean new taxes,
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.
Are they?
Are they?
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full ofScots.
Perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute
an old custom.
Grant them prima noctes.
First night.
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,
our nobles shall have
sexual rights to her
on the night
of her wedding.
Ifwe can't get them out,
we'll breed them out.
That should fetch
just the kind of lords
we want to Scotland,
taxes or no taxes, huh?
A most excellent
idea, sire.
Is it?
Now in Edinburgh ga thered
the council of Scottish nobles.
Among these was Robert
the 17th earl of Bruce,
the leading contender
forthe cro wn ofScotland.
Ah, I hear that Longshanks
has granted prima noctes.
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.
My father believes
that we must
Iull Longshanks
into our confidence
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.
A wise plan.
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.
But he sends his greetings,
and he says that I speak
for all ofthe Bruces
and for Scotland.
Ah, it's
all over now.
You've dropped
your rock.
Test of manhood.
You win.
Ah.
Call it a test
ofsoldiery, then.
The English won't let us
train with weapons,
so we train with stones.
The test ofasoldier
is not in his arm.
It's here.
No. It's here.
Ha ha!
Hamish?
Mm-hmm.
Here you go, son.
Show him how.
Ha ha ha ha!
My boy!
That was a good throw.
Aye. Aye, it was.
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.
As it--
As it matters in battle.
Could you crush a man
with that throw?
I could crush you
like a worm.
You could?
Aye.
Well, then do it.
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?
Come do it.
You'll move.
I will not.
Right.
He'll move.
Come on, Hamish.
Come on there,
Well done!
Ah!
Fine display,
young Wallace.
Are you all right?
You look
a wee bit shaky .
I should have remembered
the rocks.
Aye, you should have.
Get up, you big heap.
It's good
to see you again.
Aye. Welcome home.
Oh, me head.
Oh, you should
have moved.
William...
will you dance
with me?
Of course I will.
I've come to claim
the right ofprima noctes.
As lord ofthese lands,
I will
bless this marriage
by taking the bride
into my bed
on the first night
of her union.
Oh, by God,
you will not!
It is my noble right.
Good evening, sir.
Ah, young Wallace.
Grand softevening, huh?
Aye, it's that.
I was wondering if I might have
a word with your daughter.
What do you want
to have a word about?
Well, um...
Murron, would you like
to come and ride with me
on this fine evening?
In this?
You're out of your mind.
It's good
Scottish weather, madame.
The rain is falling
straight down.
Well, slightly
to the side, like.
She can't go with you.
No the now, anyway.
No the now.
- No the now?
- We'll see you later.
The weather'sjust fine.
It's hardly raining.
Did you not hear
what I said?
Get-- Oh.
It's you she takes after.
How could you know me
after so long?
Well, I didn't.
I saw you staring,
and I didn't know who you were.
I'm sorry.
I suppose I was.
Are you in the habit
of riding off in the rain
with strangers?
It was the best way
to make you leave.
Well, if I can ever work up
the courage to askyou again,
I'll send
written warning first.
Wouldn't do much good.
I can't read.
Can you not?
No.
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy,
isn't it?
You're going to
teach me to read, then?
if you like.
In what language?
You're showing off now.
That's right.
Are you impressed yet?
No. Why should I be?
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.
My kilt will fly up,
but I'll try it.
God, you certainly
didn't learn any manners.
The French and Romans
have far worse manners.
You've been to Rome?
Aye. Argyle took me
on a pilgrimage.
What was it like?
What does that mean?
Beautiful.
But I belong here.
Murron?
Come in now.
Sir, I know it was
strange of me
to invite Murron
to ride last night,
but I assure you--
MacClannough's daughter
is another matter.
I've come to fetch you
to our meeting.
What kind
of meeting?
The secret kind.
Your meetings are
a waste oftime, Campbell.
Your father was a fighter
and a patriot.
I know
who my father was.
I came back home
to raise crops
and, God willing,
a family.
If I can live
in peace, I will.
Go on.
You say you want
to stay out ofthe troubles?
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.
Until you prove it,
my answer's no.
No?
No, Wallace. No.
Didn't I just prove it?
No!
No?
No!
Uh!
Of course, running a farm's
a lot ofwork,
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.
So you've
got children?
Oh, not yet,
but I was hoping
that you could
help me with that.
So you want me
to marry you, then?
Well, it's a bit sudden,
but all right.
Is that what you call
a proposal?
I love you.
Always have.
I want to marry you.
Is that a "yes"?
Aye, that's a "yes."
It is?
We best hurry.
He'll be waiting.
Oh, wait.
Where are you going?
What's that?
You'll see.
Father.
I will love you
my whole life,
you and no other.
And I you,
you and no other,
forever.
When am I going
to see you again?
Tonight?
I can't.
Why not?
My dad's growin'
suspicious.
Growin' suspicious,
is he?
Wouldn't have anything
to do with that.
When? When? When?
When?
Tonight.
Tonight.
Tonight.
Look lively,
Sergeant.
Where are you
going, lassie?
Ooh, that
looks heavy.
Let me help you
with it.
No. It's fine.
I'm not going
to steal it.
Oh, you remind me
of my daughter back home.
Hello, lassie.
Aah!
No!
Shh! Shh!
Keep it quiet, Smythe.
Ah!
You bitch!
Aah!
Aah!
You...
bitch!
Are you all right?
All right?
Come on.
Are you all right?
Aye.
Are you all right?
Can you ride?
Aye.
Come back here,
you bastard!
Raise the alarm!
Help!
Meet me
at the grove.
Ride!
They're
getting away!
Go round back!
Get him!
Come on!
Ah!
Murron?
Murron!
All of you know
full well
the great pains
I've always taken
never to be too strict,
too rigid
with the application
ofour laws,
and as a consequence,
have we not learned
to live together
in relative peace
and harmony?
Huh?
And this day's lawlessness
is how you repay
my leniency!
Well, you leave me
with little choice.
An assault
on the king's soldiers...
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.
Now...
Iet this scrapper
come to me.
There.
Aah!
Aah!
Argh!
Ahh!
Corporal.
Some archers
Aah...
Hold still.
Aah!
You idiot boy!
Aah!
Argh!
Aah!
Unh!
Unh!
Father,
how are you?
Unh.
Macaulish.
Macaulish.
Macaulish!
Macaulish! Macaulish!
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!
What you waiting
for, boy?
Here. You can do it.
I'll hold him down.
Here.
You can do it.
I'll hold him down.
Pour it straight
in the wound.
It seems like a waste
of good whiskey.
Indulge me. Ah!
Aah!
Hold him.
Hold him.
Hold him.
Now let him go.
Aah!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That'll wake you up
in the morning, boy.
There's somebody coming!
Arm yourselves!
There's somebody coming.
MacGregors--
from the next clan.
We heard about
what was happening.
We don't want
you amadans
thinking you can
have your fun without us.
Go home.
Some of us
are in this.
Can't help that now.
But you can help
yourselves.
Go home.
We'll have
no homes left
when the English garrison
from the castle
comes through
and burns us out.
And they will.
Welcome.
Patrol returning,
So what news?
I have dispatched
They will be
What, are they
dressed like this?
Actually,
it was more like 50.
Make it quick.
You remember me?
I never did her
any harm.
It was my right.
Your right?
I'm here to claim the right
I am William Wallace.
And the rest of you
will be spared.
Go back to England
and tell them there
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.
Tell them Scotland is free.
Burn it.
The Scottish rebels
have routed
one of my garrisons
and murdered
the noble lord.
I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.
And how would you deal
with this brigand?
Like any common thief.
Have the local
magistrate arrest him
and punish him
accordingly.
Leave us.
Wallace has already
killed the magistrate
and taken control
ofthe town.
Stand up.
Stand up.
In the morning,
I depart for France
to press our rights there,
and I leave you here to
quell this little rebellion.
Understood?
ls it?
Unh!
One day,
you will be a king.
At least
try to act like one.
Get away from me!
Convene my military council.
Aah!
There!
After them.
No point resisting.
You're out numbered
and trapped.
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?
Father?
Oh, come in.
Come in.
A rebellion
has begun.
Under whom?
A commoner...
named William Wallace.
You will embrace
this rebellion.
Support it from
our lands in the north.
I will gain
English favor
by condemning it
and ordering it opposed
from our lands
in the south.
Sit down.
Stay a while.
This Wallace...
he doesn't even
have a knighthood,
but he fights
with passion,
and he inspires.
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did, eh?
So would l.
Well, maybe it's time.
It is time...
to survive.
You're the 1 7th
Robert Bruce.
The 1 6 before you
passed you land and title
because they didn 't
charge in.
Call a meeting
ofthe nobles.
They do nothing
but talk.
Rightly so.
They're as rich
in English titles and lands
as they are in Scottish,
just as we are.
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.
He has courage.
So does a dog.
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.
And understand this--
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king
ever to sit
on the throne of England,
and none of us
and nothing of Scotland
will remain
unless we are as ruthless.
Give ear to our nobles.
Knowing their minds
is the key
to the throne.
Wait. Wait.
Look.
This is out,
and this is left.
Carry on.
You know...
eventually,
Longshanks will send
his whole northern army
against us.
Heavy cavalry,
armored horse--
shake the very ground.
They'll ride
right over us.
Uncle Argyle used to
talk about it,
how no army ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.
So what do we do?
Hit, run, hide,
the Highland way.
We'll make spears.
Hundreds ofthem.
Long spears--
twice as long as a man.
That long?
Aye.
Some men are longer
than others.
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again.
Volunteers coming in!
William Wallace,
we've come to fight
and to die foryou.
Stand up, man.
I'm not the pope.
My name is Faudron.
My sword is yours.
I brought you this.
We checked them for arms.
I brought you this.
My wifemade it
foryou.
Thankyou.
Him? That can't
be William Wallace.
I'm prettier
than this man.
All right, Father.
I'll ask him.
If I risk
my neck foryou,
will I get a chance
to kill Englishmen?
Is your father
a ghost,
or do you converse
with the Almighty?
To find his equal,
an lrishman talks to God.
The Almighty says
don't change the subject.
Just answer
the fucking question.
Mind your tongue.
Insane lrish.
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.
That's my friend,
lrishman,
and the answer
to your question is yes.
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.
Stephen is my name.
I'm the most wanted
man on my island,
except I'm not on my island,
of course.
More's the pity.
Your island?
You mean lreland?
Yeah. It's mine.
You're a madman.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
I've come to
the right place, then.
Aah!
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?
I didn't like him
anyway.
He wasn't right
in the head.
William!
It's several runners!
Hello.
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.
Do the nobles
rally?
Robert the Bruce
and most ofthe others
will not commit
to battle,
but word has spread,
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.
In droves of hundreds
and thousands.
Are you ready
for a war?
What news?
We're outnumbered,
at least three to one.
How many horse?
We must negotiate.
Who's in command?
Did he have
a scarlet chevron?
Aye, he did.
We can still
negotiate.
What are they
talking about?
I can't hear,
but it does not look good.
The nobles
will negotiate.
They'll do
a deal,
then we go home.
If not,
we charge.
We have no chance.
So many.
I didn't come here
to fight
so they could own
more lands.
Then I'll have to
work for them.
Nor me.
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.
Let's go home!
Stop, men!
Do not flee!
Wait until
we've negotiated!
William Wallace.
Can't be.
Not tall enough.
The Almighty says this must be
a fashionable fight.
It's drawn
the finest people.
Where is thy salute?
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield,
I give you thanks.
This is our army.
Tojoin it,
you give homage.
I give homage to Scotland,
and ifthis isyo ur army...
why does it go?
We didn't come here
Home!
The English are too many.
Sons ofScotland...
I am William Wallace.
William Wallace
is 7 feet tall.
Yes. I've heard.
He kills men
by the hundreds,
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English
with fireballs
from his eyes
and bolts of lightning
from his arse.
I am William Wallace...
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen
here in defiance
oftyranny.
You've come to fight
as free men.
And free men you are.
What will you do
with that freedom?
Will you fight?
- No!
- No!
- No!
- No!
Against that?
We will run,
and we will live.
Aye.
Fight, and you may die.
Run, and you'll live...
at least awhile.
And dying in your beds
many years from now,
would you be willing
to trade
all the days
from this day to that
for one chance--
just one chance--
to come back here
and tell our enemies
that they may take
our lives,
but they'll never take
our freedom?
Albagu bra!
They seem quite
optimistic to me.
Maybe they do
want to fight.
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,
but, nonetheless,
I think we should deliver
the king's terms.
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.
Milord, I think--
All right.
Offer them the terms.
Shall we go and meet them?
Let me do the talking.
Agreed.
Fine speech.
Now what do we do?
Just be yourselves.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick
a fight.
Hyah!
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.
Here are
the king's terms--
Lead this army
off the field...
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,
including
hereditary title,
from which you will pay--
from which you will pay him
an annual duty--
I have an offer
foryou.
Cheltham, this is
William Wallace.
From which you will pay
the king an annual duty--
I said I have
an offer foryou.
You disrespect
a banner oftruce?
From his king?
Absolutely.
Here are
Scotland's terms--
Loweryour flags
and march
straight back
to England,
stopping at every home
you pass by
to beg forgiveness
for 1 00 years oftheft,
rape, and murder.
Do that,
and your men shall live.
Do it not, and every one
of you will die today.
Ha ha ha ha!
You are outmatched.
You have no
heavy cavalry.
In two centuries,
no army has won--
I'm not finished!
Before we let you leave,
your commander
must cross that field,
present himself
before this army,
put his head
between his legs,
and kiss his own arse.
I'd say that was rather
less cordial than he's used to.
Be ready and do
exactly as I say.
On my signal,
ride round behind our position
and flank them.
We must not
divide our forces.
Do it, and let the English
see you do it.
They'll think
we run away.
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.
Right.
Come on.
Hyah!
Insolent bastard.
I want this Wallace's
heart on a plate.
Archers.
Archers! Archers!
Archers!
Archers, forward!
Aah!
You bastards!
Loose!
The Lord tells me
he can get me out ofthis mess,
but He's pretty sure
you're fucked.
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Ready!
Loose!
Ride!
See. Every Scot with a horse
is fleeing.
Our cavalry will ride
them down like grass.
