- Can l get a ride?
- Allez-y voir le camion.
Hey, Pricey. You tuna-sucking piece
of raw meat, get your ass over here.
Move over.
Sit down here.
- How you doin'?
- Good.
Good to see you. What the hell
you going to Zambeze for?
l thought l'd get some great shots
of your head being blown to smithereens.
Smithereens!
- Thought you were with the government.
- l am.
- This is the government.
- These are the rebels.
The fuck they are. This is
a government convoy to Calunda.
This is the Abou Deian revolutionary front.
You're shittin' me.
They'd be pissed off if they knew.
This is the dumbest motherfucker l ever
signed up for, man. lt don't even pay shit.
Nicaragua. That's the spot.
Cheap shrimp, lotta rays.
lt's real thin in the spook department too.
You dig me?
Price, l don't what you're doin',
but you'd better get your ass down here.
Come on, man.
You're gonna get ripped to shit.
Oates, what the hell is this?
The US government offers that house to
any Cuban pilot flying MiGs for the rebels
who chooses to defect to America
with a Russian jet.
- But that's bullshit.
- We know that, but they don't.
They figure the Cubies will go for that
pool, so they don't let them near the jets.
The rebels can't fly MiGs.
Pricey, that's the point.
They destroy their own air force.
lt's an old scam,
but it's guaran-fuckin'-teed.
- Who is this? ClA?
- Yeah.
The smartest guys in the world.
l guess we found out
where the government is.
You can walk to work from here.
What a break.
l guess l'll get goin'. Take care.
Be careful.
l love Africa.
So this strange war
grinds into its seventh year.
From Ndjamena, Chad,
this is Claire Sheridan.
No, no, you didn't hear any music.
lt must be the connection.
OK. Yes. Goodbye.
Alex, don't play that goddamn thing
when l'm filing. We're late.
lt's my party. We'll be late.
You called it a strange war.
lf you filed that story with me,
l would say you were editorialising.
Well, l like to editorialise.
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk?
Only with the memory of making love
to you on the plains of Fianga,
with the First Liberation Army
marching by, and opening fire.
- We freed the proletariat?
- And we freed...
l'm going to the party without you.
l don't wanna go to this party.
l'm bad at false modesty.
- You're great at it.
- You're right, l am.
Alex, you're gonna make
a great anchorman in New York.
Undoubtedly l could win an Emmy
as a hostess, but l'm not going with you.
You could operate out of New York.
We could buy a place, burn our suitcases.
l still like suitcases.
l'm tired of memorising the President
of the Republic of Maldives.
- You tired of Third-World wars?
- No, l'm tired of Third-World elevators.
Look... Wait.
Don't leave me.
l have to, Alex.
Fuck Abou Deia and New York.
l'm goin' to Nicaragua with you.
- No!
- lt's a neat little war and a nice hotel.
Hey!
Alex! Alex!
Come on! Yeah!
All right, l want you to know this is
the man that hired me for my first job.
And fired you from your first job.
- And then hired me for my second job.
- And fired you!
Some of you may be asking yourself
''What am l doing in this strange war?''
Another chapter in an endless struggle
that's grinding into its seventh year.
But who of us can forget the giant
struggle on the plains of Fianga?
The give and take, the lunging,
the parrying for position,
the jockeying around, knowing full well...
Thank you very much. Look at this.
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert caravan
Night and stars above are shining bright
Oh, excuse me.
l didn't know you were in here.
Yes, you did. You were taking
pictures of me all over the room.
Well, you know...
l mean...
- Jeez, you look great.
- Thanks.
Here.
This is for Alex.
That's lovely, but it's not the best thing
you could give him right now.
- Why not?
- We just split up.
- Who split up from who this time?
- This time?
This time l'm the villain.
l thought it would be cleaner with me
in Central America and him in New York.
Did he shout about
burning your suitcases?
Yeah.
Well...
l don't own any suitcases.
There's nothing to burn.
This is a great shot.
Yes, it is.
NlCARAGUA, 1 979
Espérate.
- Vamos.
- Síganme.
Rafael! Rafael libre!
Rafael! Rafael! Rafael!
- Hey, Russel. How are you?
- Hey!
- Ah... Welcome to Managua.
- Did you have anything to do with that?
Well, l thought of calling your
photographs ''The Pictures of a Lost War''.
The New York editors loved it,
since they didn't know where Chad was.
lt kinda legitimised their ignorance.
You got your cover, l got a feature.
A class struggle in three little words.
Nifty, huh?
Nifty, l say.
- l'm Russel Price.
- This is lsela Cruz.
She works at the hotel,
also as a translator.
My pleasure.
You guys have a few
problems down here,
between the ''poets''...
and the government?
Problems? Down here it's called a war.
lt started in 1 930, before you were born...
Excuse me. My Spanish is not good.
What did he say?
He said he considers it an honour
to be able to photograph our war.
- He's got a real way with words.
- l can tell.
- You're a hell of a translator.
- l know.
l'm much in demand around here.
Will you excuse me?
- lf you have any questions, just ask.
- Who's Rafael?
Depends on who you ask.
Rafael. Comandante Rafael.
He is either a Marxist dupe
of Russia and Cuba
or the most popular leader of
a democratic revolution. Take your pick.
Hell of a face.
Would he like to be photographed?
- You would never find him.
- Wanna bet?
You would lose.
He's never been photographed.
- Congratulations on your elephants.
- Oh, thank you.
So far, Alex, this war
has the hell beat out of Africa.
- You're gonna have a ball.
-  Alex!
Hands off, OK? l need a translator
much more than you do right now.
Aren't you hangin' in there with Claire?
l'm hangin' in there,
like an interim post-war government
waiting for the palace to be
overrun by younger men.
Younger men?
Yeah, Russel. You know,
l still only have one major weakness.
- Oh, only one?
- Yeah. l hold onto things too long.
l'm too loyal.
OK, Alex, listen. Jody borrowed
l owe 40 bucks to Dick, and he'll pay me
in lire for a future in pesos. Good rate.
But you gotta pay Eddie in dollars,
so l can square it with Chuck.
We got it all worked out - cash.
- You take Nicaraguan?
- No cordobas.
But l'll go double or nothing
with you on the whole pile.
OK.
November 2nd, 1 963.
Martin Luther King - ''l have a dream.''
- Diem was assassinated.
- Oh, shit!
How'd you know that?
- Your first cover.
- First cover. Right.
Thank you.
Moonlight in Vermont
Otra vez falló.
- l'm sorry. Sometimes the flash...
- Maybe l can fix it.
Thank you very much.
Señoras y señores, quiero invitar
a este escenario a un gran amigo mío.
Su nombre es Alex.
Alex, please come here.
- That's you.
- Not many places where l can still play.
Oh, that's great.
Gracias.
l like it.
Spring is here, no mistakin'
Well, l just got off the boat.
Give me the scoop on Nicaragua.
Well, about 60 years ago,
the US marines invaded
to protect American business interests.
Put down a small peasant revolt led by a
very small man named Augusto Sandino.
No, no, no. l don't mean the peasant stuff.
l mean the real stuff.
Come on.
Well, there are two kinds of beer:
Tona and Victoria. Victoria's better.
And two... watch out for Miss Panama.
Hot, hot, hot, but don't touch.
She belongs to Tacho.
El presidente has said that if he catches
anybody with her, he will cut off his...
- Pecker?
- Right. And throw it in Lake Managua.
l know the tune
This is love, this is it
You're gonna love this war. There's
good guys, bad guys, and cheap shrimp.
And Alex singing in the background.
We've gotta get alone somewhere.
Around the New Year
Now it's safe for lovers just to go
Jesus, he's doing that on purpose.
Alex is one of the world's experts
on military strategy, you know.
Spring can really hang you up the most
- Price!
- Regis.
Congratulations on the African snaps.
Hello, Claire. Haven't seen you since, uh...
- Three Mile lsland?
- Yes. Holiday lnn, right?
Well, look who walked in.
Before you fall in love, that's Marcel Jazy,
friend of wine, women, and Somoza.
Yeah, l know. He's also a businessman
in search of a business,
who doesn't try to cover up
his connection to Washington.
l like his connection in Nicaragua tonight.
But look at those moves.
Can the ClA light cigarettes like that?
One more
Melody
Champagne.
Thought we might make a toast.
Please to stay at your table...
and you won't be hurt.
No se muevan.
We don't want to waste ammunition
on someone like you.
- What do you want?
- Shut up!
Come with us. We won't hurt you.
We'll trade you for some Nicaraguans
who care about their country.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hold on. Alex, it's Charlie from New York.
He says a nightclub bombing isn't big
enough to hold for the world section.
There were bits of body in the piano and
the song was ''Moonlight in Vermont''.
- What's he got better than that?
- He's got the Pope in Egypt.
Terrific.
Forget the Pope. You got
the Pope someplace every week.
There's a big story down here, because
it's the first sign of fighting in Managua.
Get a map, Charlie. Look up Nicaragua.
You drive to New Orleans
and then you turn left.
Oh, like hell l'm editorialising. Look, it
happened in a room full of press and ClA.
How do l know they were ClA? Because
they wore name tags. What do you think?
We're backing a fascist government.
l know that's not news,
but see if you can find an angle, huh?
Alex, there's fascist and there's fascist.
Let's not use words like that, OK?
No, we don't have any pictures of Rafael,
because nobody knows where he is.
Anybody crazy enough to go and look
for him is gonna get his nuts shot off.
Same to you, Charlie.
- What do you want?
- We've met, Alex.
Hub Kittle, from Lewitsky and Knupp,
New York, public relations.
- l have a client down here.
- Who's your client?
President Somoza.
Yeah, l know, l know,
but there's an untold story here.
The man has a point of view too, right?
Right.
You're, uh... Price, right? Russel?
l need to know whether Russian or
Cuban-made guns were brought in.
lf the guerillas had help,
the war would have ended long ago.
- Well, that's fine, but we need proof.
- Claire!
lt's your daughter from Los Angeles.
Hello.
Hello, darling. How are you?
Has your grandmother
spoiled you silly by now?
She has? Great.
Yes, l got the letter
with the picture of your dress.
You don't think it's cut a little too low?
You don't, huh? Well, l do.
Gringo.
You're under arrest.
l'm a journalist. Periodista. Periodista.
Here, l got my passport.
You take too many pictures.
Periodista.
Wake up, Priest, son of a whore.
Cigarrillo?
Sí.
You're a priest, huh? A padre?
What are you doing here?
The government accused me
of knowing Rafael.
Governments are always wrong, huh?
- Who are you?
- Periodista.
l'd like to find Rafael myself.
- Whose side are you on?
- l don't take sides, l take pictures.
No side?
Go home.
- Espérate aquí.
- Sí.
Mr Price. lt was all a misunderstanding.
Your camera.
l'm sorry.
Passport.
Before you go, you will sign some papers.
- What papers?
- Your visitation papers, Mr Price.
You were not arrested. You just came
to visit, in case your embassy asks.
You want your passport back, yes?
- You OK?
- l'm fine.
- How'd you know where to find me?
- Where else? What happened?
Oh, l was just visiting. Jazy was there.
l think he had me released.
- Jazy? Think there's a story?
- l don't know. But l can start looking.
- Looking for what?
- l'm gonna find Rafael.
Now, Russel, we have
to be clever with Jazy.
Don't worry. l won't come right out
and ask him if he's a spy or not.
- Are you a spy or aren't you?
- Spy is such a nonword, Mr Price.
- Nobody is a spy any more.
- Russel prefers pictures to words.
You don't have to apologise.
You are journalists.
- And you're a businessman?
- A businessman...
That sounds good.
OK, l'm a businessman.
Why was l arrested and then released?
Who the hell are you?
- No water?
- No, no water.
Marcel, you told me there'd be
water in the pool this week.
lf she dove in, l assure you
she would not notice.
My darling, the guerillas destroyed
the pumping station in Masaya.
We must ration water for now.
Maybe l should go back to Panama?
Maybe you should.
Please.
Con permiso.
You were arrested because the Guardia
are clowns who specialise in excess.
You were released because
l told them to release you.
Thank you.
Those aren't the normal
duties of a businessman.
But they are the normal duties of a spy.
You win, l am a spy.
There, are you happy? l feel better.
Now we can relax.
You can turn off your little thing.
Oh, l trust you won't say
anything to hurt me.
Why would we wanna do that?
ln some ways, l am a terrible spy.
l used to be much better at it, but now
it seems everyone knows who l am.
l have too many girlfriends.
l like to be photographed.
l talk too much. l always talk too much.
But my girlfriends like that.
- No matter.
-  Marcel?
- Do you know who she is?
- No.
That's Miss Panama.
Do you know who that is?
Yes, l do.
She's in love with me.
l've got to get some water in the pool.
And once a week l have lunch
with President Somoza
to discuss security measures
against the Sandinista insurgents,
and all he wants to talk about
is Miss Panama.
He is worried about her.
- He thinks she's seeing another man?
- He assigned me to find out who he is.
Thank you.
We all know the revolutionaries
are going to win.
Don't we?
You know, l saw this picture
on a leaflet in Africa.
You know what they all say about it?
That you're the genius
that created that idea.
lt was a lot of people's idea.
Have you been to León?
- No.
- No, we're going to Masaya.
We understand the rebels
have entered the cuartel.
You would love León.
A nice cathedral. Beautiful light.
- We're not doing a travelogue.
- Of course, of course.
Only l have heard that Comandante Rafael
was recently in the area.
- Rafael's near León?
- Well, it's a rumour. What do l know?
Marcel, estoy desamparada.
- She's lonely.
- Well, we don't want to keep you.
lt's my job.
Do you think l talk too much?
So Rafael's near León.
Did you dream about
Miss Panama last night?
No. l dreamed about you.
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah. So did you.
ls that an old war injury flaring up?
- ls that tape recorder on?
- Absolutely.
l was sunning myself on the USS Pueblo
when the North Koreans attacked.
l took a bullet in the chest.
But l was lucky.
l had a roll of Ektachrome
in my pocket here over my heart...
And the bullet ricocheted
over the film and grazed your cheek...
Saved my life. You heard about it, huh?
- Do you ever dream about me?
- Yeah, once.
How was it?
Fast.
- How fast?
- Real fast.
You mean this fast?
That's another Rafael sign.
LEÓN
PROVlNClAL CAPlTAL
Bájense. Documentos.
lt's June 10th. The evacuation of León.
Signs for the FSLN are everywhere.
A woman carries a pig.
Carlos!
Do you want photographs?
Come with us.
- You must help us one more time.
- For León, for Nicaragua.
No, l don't want to.
- Americans?
- Yes.
Journalists, sí?
Pedro, there's no time to waste.
When you get back to the States, l want
you give this ball to Dennis Martinez,
- from me, sí? Dennis Martinez, sí?
- Dennis Martinez.
Enrique is dead. The Guardia control
the church and we need your help.
Pedro.
- You come. You come, huh?
- Yes.
Use the back way.
The Guardia have the stairs covered.
Go through the courtyard.
lt's not safe. Come with me.
Aquí, aquí. Rápido.
Ahora! Fuego!
Ahora, súbete!
A la torre!
Listo?
- Por aquí.
- Ya los vi.
Bring out your dead and wounded.
Price, is that you?
- You motherfucker, Price, is that you?
- Yeah.
Where are those bastards?
They away?
They're away.
- You all right?
- Yeah. lt's not my blood.
- Man, that kid's got a good arm.
- Yeah.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What the fuck are you doing here?
Man, my ears are freakin' out.
You're lookin' good.
- How do you like Nicaragua?
- lt's beautiful.
Yeah, there's a shitload
of greasers, though.
No queda nadie.
- Pricey, l'll see you later, man.
- Yeah.
Se acabó, vámonos!
- You OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.
The kid's got a hell of an arm.
Sandy Koufax, no?
- Gracias, padre.
- De nada. Vayan con Dios.
Koufax was good.
But Dennis Martinez, he is the best.
He's from Nicaragua.
He pitches major leagues.
- l'd like to find Rafael.
- He was here, but he's gone.
He's going to Matagalpa, no?
You control a baseball
better than your words.
Rafael cannot be found.
You understand, compañeros?
What's Rafael doing in Matagalpa?
Just keep your talk to baseball.
You see Dennis Martinez,
you tell him that my curve ball is better,
that l have a good scroogie.
l like Sandinistas.
And l like Baltimore Orioles.
You bastard!
- What are we gonna do about him?
- He's dead.
You can't believe
everything you hear in the news.
l think about you all the time.
l'll try and get back before you graduate.
l love you very, very much.
l'll finish this up back at the hotel, honey.
Bye-bye now.
l know who shot Pedro.
Somebody in the bell tower.
- Why didn't you tell the guerillas?
- Because l knew they'd kill him.
And l didn't wanna interfere.
lt wasn't an easy choice.
l think l made the wrong one.
Do you know that you didn't shoot any
pictures after that whole thing was over?
l didn't, did l?
Oh, Jesus, l picked up the gun.
ls something happening to us?
Yeah, l think so.
Yeah, l know.
- How was Matagalpa?
- No bang-bang, Alex. None at all.
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah. Half the press corps.
Hello?
Claire.
Hey!
- Alex.
- How you doing?
- How was León?
- Bloody.
Claire, l'm tired of Nicaragua.
- You haven't been here very long.
- Yeah.
Long enough.
Long enough.
You're right. Everybody's right.
About what?
My cheekbones.
What do you think of 'em?
l like your cheekbones, Alex.
ls there anything the matter?
lt's a face made for television.
You mean you decided
to go with the network?
Yeah.
They're gonna give me
ten grand a week to read the news.
l'm gonna be in 60 million homes
every night.
When l take a breath,
all of America will do so.
When my voice trembles,
all of America will tremble.
l'm gonna be a star.
My voice will be more important
than who controls Congress.
- You'll become a household name.
- l'll become a household name.
l should never have come down here.
l'm sorry, Alex.
l think it's a lot better this way.
lt's all right. Don't worry about me.
l'm speaking in song titles.
- But promise me one thing.
- l'll promise you anything.
No farewell parties. l don't wanna
make a speech to anyone.
- Russel?
- Russel who?
Him too.
- Ça va bien?
- Comment ça va?
You're running late, Mr President.
We can schedule this for another time.
Nonsense. Let them wait.
We are a stunning couple, huh?
My stomach is like a rock.
l've been working out.
Yes, we are a stunning couple.
Mr President, you own
one fifth of the land in Nicaragua.
You own the port, the airlines,
the Mercedes dealership...
ls it a crime to be a car dealer?
Let me show you something.
lt's said that the Guardia operates
a torture chamber at Coyotepe.
This is a portrait of my father.
He was very special to me.
Every Sunday morning l drive out to the
cemetery and put flowers on his grave.
l think people should know that.
Would you comment on
the fall of León to the rebels?
Listen, Russel. Let's grow up, huh?
lt's easy to fall in love with the underdog,
but there's an upside
and a downside to this thing.
l just wanna remind you all this stuff
about a ''revolution of poets'' is crap.
lt's great PR though, isn't it, Hub?
So what's the upside?
Simple, and it could happen.
Somoza destroys the insurgents,
rebuilds the country,
shitcans the purveyors of excess,
stabilises the cordoba,
and is finally beloved as
the saviour of Nicaragua. Our pal.
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah.
- What's the downside?
- Commies take over the world.
Señor Kittle.
Excuse me, Russel,
but the war may be over.
This is a democracy, and l have
been freely elected by my people.
- There were more votes than voters...
- Presidente!
No me ven que estoy ocupado
con esta señorita? Váyase de aquí.
l am sorry. l have to conclude
this encounter. Something happened.
l have many more questions,
Mr President...
Did he tell you about his parents
and the graveyard?
- Yes, l know about that, but l'd like to...
- Good, good.
- l'll just make sure everything's set up.
- Sí, rápido.
My friends, this gathering was not
supposed to be a press conference
as much as a get-together.
But l've just been handed
a piece of news.
Rafael is dead.
He has been killed in an ambush
near Matagalpa.
- Mr President!
- How many people killed?
Sorry, my friends. No questions, please.
A press release is being prepared.
Call Washington.
What do you think?
Tacho makes that speech about
every six months. Maybe he got lucky.
- Hub, is this for real?
- Yeah, sure.
Russel, excuse me, but Miss Panama
would like her picture taken with Tacho.
- ln colour?
- OK. A little embarrassing, huh?
Señor presidente.
Listo, listo.
That'll be fine right there.
How in the hell could Tacho find Rafael?
Russel, please. l have my hands full.
That's fine right there.
ls Tacho lying again?
They did kill him, didn't they?
What do l know?
Tacho needs a victory very badly.
He needs to prove to Jimmy Carter
that he is still winning.
The death of Rafael is the proof he needs.
Carter doesn't need proof. He just sent
No, no. He didn't.
The State Department is getting nervous
about what is going on down here.
En el sol, por favor.
Pardon my French,
but whose fucking side are you on?
- l work for everybody.
- That's a great job.
l send messages to Jimmy and l tell him
that the revolution is a flood
which cannot be stopped,
but it can be controlled.
Nobody listens to me.
l can't even get a little water in my pool.
Would you switch sides, please?
For just one more.
That's very nice, very nice. Thank you.
l think Rafael is alive. l'm gonna find him.
Thank you very much.
MATAGALPA
NORTHERN PROVlNCE
- There's the guy we're lookin' for.
- Terrific.
Go one more block.
Oh, shit! l'm not gonna die in Matagalpa.
Pare. Pare.
Alto. Alto!
- Calm down, Regis.
- l'm not stayin'!
For Christ's sake, they wanted to look
at our credentials. What are you doing?
Me escuchan?
Si va una combi, deténganla.
Bájese! Alto!
Get down!
Jesus!
Look out!
Stop! Stop it!
- Periodista.
- Televisión.
Let's go!
Abre la puerta, por favor!
Gracias, señora.
You all right?
Asesinos!
Ahora.
Aguante.
Alto! Alto!
Stay down.
Libertad!
Periodista.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Periodista.
- Viva Rafael!
- Que viva!
Entren.
The translator from the hotel.
You're looking for Rafael?
- Yeah, if it's possible.
- How'd you know?
Mr Price doesn't do anything before
announcing it first to the whole world.
lt's a good story. You'll be more famous.
Vengan, compañeros.
What is it?
Rafael is dead.
- l can smell it.
- Vengan acá.
Come on.
What were you talking about?
He's dead. l know it.
l wonder what they want with us.
l don't know.
No les he dicho nada.
- This is Comandante Cinco.
- Es un placer.
León has fallen
and today we took Matagalpa.
Masaya is next and then Managua.
Because Nicaragua
will soon be free, Mr Price,
we've decided that it's time
for you to meet Rafael.
- We need a photograph.
- The Western press needs a photograph.
The world is not divided
into East and West any more.
lt's divided into North and South.
Come with us.
You're a great photographer.
Make him alive.
Why are you laughing?
You're crazy.
We have momentum,
but many more lives will be lost.
Even Washington is starting to admit
that Somoza is not loved by his people.
They have detained $25 million
in new arms shipments to Somoza
at an airfield in Florida,
until they find out
if Rafael is alive or dead.
lf Washington thinks Rafael is dead,
they will ship the arms to Somoza.
Do you understand?
Yes.
- l'm a journalist.
- This has nothing to do with journalism.
Enough of our people
have been lost already.
We need to keep him alive
a few more days.
Once the war is over, none of this matters.
l don't do things like this.
l know this is difficult for you,
but you must do it.
ln the morning, when there's better light.
lt will be a great picture.
lt sure would be
a prizewinner, wouldn't it?
l've won enough prizes.
But you haven't won a war.
Are you sure?
Foto muy complicado, huh?
Yeah, it's complicated, all right.
Do l go back and say l missed
the biggest story in the war?
Do l go back and say that
l saw Rafael stone-cold dead?
Or do l just say that we fell in love with
the guerillas because their cause was...
Sympathetic?
Yeah, sympathetic.
Christ, what are we doing here?
You.
Más arriba.
That's fine.
Yeah, that's good.
All right.
Viva Rafael!
Viva Rafael!
Marcel.
-  Le gusta?
- Mucho, mucho, mucho.
Gracias.
Under a still, grey July sky...
Start again.
Under a clear, steel Managua... Scratch it.
President Somoza has ordered the air
force to bomb the capital under a sky of...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Look.
- Oh, my God.
-  What the hell is he doing here?
- l have no idea.
Can you frame me
with that smoke in the frame?
- Yeah, we got the smoke.
- Well, roll it.
Speed.
This is Regis Seydor in Managua.
This tiny nation of smouldering volcanoes
has erupted into a civil war.
Fighting has broken out on the streets
of the capital for the first time...
Hi.
- Alex.
- Congratulations.
- On what?
- ''On what?''
The news services, the wire,
The Washington Post, The Times.
Everybody's got it. lt's a fabulous picture.
- Yes, it really is fabulous.
- Yeah, it is.
- How come you're back?
- l came back to see Russel.
See me? About what?
The East Coast is in love with Rafael.
They were sure he was dead this time.
They're gonna do a musical. You can't
move without seeing his mug on T-shirts.
He's bigger than Farrah Fawcett.
You look great. Things OK?
Things are great, yeah. l've never
been happier. You two, uh...?
- Terrific.
- Yeah?
Alex, you know me, l'm a little slow.
Exactly why are you here?
l wanna do an interview with Rafael.
You're the only man
who can take me to him.
- What's the matter?
- Nothin'.
We may not be able
to find him, you know.
l have supreme confidence in you.
- Claire looks good.
- Everybody looks good in the tropics.
What the hell does that mean?
- Alex, l'm in love with her.
- l know, and she thinks she loves you.
No, it's past the thinking stage.
Can l ask you something? This probably
doesn't mean a goddamn thing, but...
it's something that interests me.
Were you guys making it
before we came here?
No!
- ls that the truth?
- Yes.
For God's sakes, Alex. We're friends.
OK.
Alto. Alto.
Periodista. Periodista.
- Bájese!
- Prensa, prensa.
Periodista.
Periodista.
Vamos.
Vamos.
Buenos días.
- You must go through a lot of rental cars.
- Don't worry. l put it in your name.
Give me your papers.
Come on, come on.
Get those bodies on the truck... fast!
And you too! Now!
Hey, Pricey! Welcome to
Somoza's meat market.
Hey, no pictures, huh? lt might look bad.
What do you get paid,
by the hour or by the body?
l get paid the same way you do.
What the fuck are you doin' in Sebaco?
This place is about to blow.
- Why'd you shoot Pedro?
- Who the fuck is Pedro?
Jesus Christ.
There's a motherfuckin' war
goin' on here, pal! A lot of sad stories.
- Do you know those guys?
- Yeah. l used to.
- Motherfuckin' cocksucker!
- l don't suck no dick!
- You goddamn...
- Hey, hey, hey!
l prefer not to blow your brains out
in a dump like this! l got my priorities!
You better get him outta here before he's
a number. lt'd be a shitty town to buy it in.
- Why them? Just why them?
- Why them?! Why them?
Come here, l'll show you why them.
You too. Come on.
Come here.
lf your mug shows up in this box, you
come through Sebaco, l own your ass.
- Where did you get those photographs?
- ls this a fuckin' interview?
l'm not gonna quote you.
Where'd you get those pictures?
Off the record?
Some Pachuco gives 'em to me.
Ain't none of my business,
but l hear he gets 'em from a Frenchy.
They say Somoza likes women,
but this one ain't got a chance.
Nice, huh?
You ever meet Tacho?
A real piece of work.
Oh, Jesus.
- ls she dead?
- Not yet.
Hey, give me those pictures.
Hey, you got any dope?
Tough place to find decent dope.
What do you expect?
We're the ones gettin' our butts kicked.
Some motherfucker stole my pictures
and l don't know what fuckin' happened!
Goddamn it! Fuck me!
- Didn't you ship your film to New York?
- No, l developed it in my room.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Alex!
Slow down, man. lt's not your fault
if somebody took your...
Yes, it was.
What about Rafael?
- l don't think it's Jazy.
- He said it was a Frenchman.
How many Frenchmen
do you know who live around here?
Quédense aquí.
l'll look here.
- Are we looking for negs or prints?
- Anything.
-
- Abran la puerta!
- l'll get the door.
- Yeah.
Abran la puerta o la tenemos que bajar.
Rápido!
- What do you want?
- Where is Mr Jazy?
He's not here.
- Who are you?
- l'm his girlfriend.
No, no, l'm sorry.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
That man has a lot of girlfriends.
Russel?
Russel?
He knew l'd find Rafael.
He wanted me to.
Probably even knew he was dead.
And l'd take pictures of
every fuckin' thing l saw.
He kills people.
Let's get outta here.
Hola.
We've been to every bar in town.
l still don't see Rafael.
Yeah, well, just hang in there a minute.
This is what l wanted to show you.
You brought us through three roadblocks
to show us a statue of Tacho?
lt's not Tacho. lt's Mussolini.
Tacho went to ltaly
to commission a statue of himself.
He found a warehouse full of
il Duces on horseback.
He got a great deal on one.
Brought it back here.
He switched heads.
You can't tell, can you?
What are we doin' here?
l think what he's trying to say,
what we're trying to say,
is that things aren't exactly
the way they seem to be.
Well, things don't seem to be too great,
so l can't wait to hear this one.
Here we are, two guys in love with the
same dame, in the tropics, bullets flying...
- Alex, that's not why we're here.
- Oh, yeah?
l left this country because of this man.
l came back because of this man.
Now the cutest couple in town's
got me looking up a horse's ass
on a midnight tour of Managua.
What's goin' on?
Rafael is dead.
- ln the picture he's dead?
- He's dead.
- How in the hell did you...
- Who cares how?
Alex, l think l finally saw
one too many bodies.
Somoza is a killer.
l thought the war would end sooner.
How many reasons do you want?
You saw too many bodies?
That's a lot of bodies.
You stupid son of a bitch.
- Did he talk you into this?
- No. l wanted Rafael to be alive.
Had you been there you'd understand!
l've seen a hundred Rafaels,
a hundred Somozas.
Don't you ever tell me who's sentimental!
You just served me up your careers.
l could bury both of you.
Look around you. Look at the war.
Can't you see what's goin' on?
l'm not just talking about Rafael.
That's a lie l despise, but l understand.
l'm talking about
the two of you lyin' to me.
l didn't know how you'd take it, Alex!
How could you lie to me?
This is a motherfuckin' story.
What am l supposed to do with it?
Have you found Rafael yet?
You know, there's a rather strange one
goin' around about him.
Thought you might have the answer.
You see, there's a rumour
that Rafael is dead,
that Price's pictures are phoney.
That's bullshit. Rafael's alive.
All right, mate.
Alex.
Listen... l feel terrible.
- l wanna talk.
- l don't.
Listen, tomorrow l want you
to take me to try to find Jazy.
l'll do a piece on this sexy French spy
and then New York can take it or leave it.
We looked for Rafael
and couldn't find him.
- You owe me one.
- Yeah, right.
Are you sure this is the way to Jazy's?
l hope so. l might have got
turned around at the last roadblock.
Rápido! Rápido!
l thought he lived near here,
but it feels different.
Yeah. When did
the fighting get this close?
Where in the hell are we?
l don't know. l don't know
what's going down here.
This looks pretty rough.
This town looks like
it's ready to go, Russel.
-
-
Jesus!
Alex, l don't like this.
Let's get the hell outta here.
- Which way is the hotel?
- l'm not sure.
- Turn here.
- Let's go.
- Take the flag with you.
- l'll ask this old gal.
Señora?
Which way is the Hotel Continental?
l don't know. Ask the soldiers.
Al muro. Al muro!
Arriba las manos. Arriba!
You fucks! You fucks!
Dos a la izquierda,
dos a la derecha, dos más allá.
Psst! Psst!
Señor!
You!
Come, follow me.
This is all l can offer.
Gracias. Gracias.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Señoras y señores.
May l have your attention, please?
El presidente Anastasio Somoza.
lt is with grave concern
that we announce the death of
senior correspondent Alex Grazier,
who has been murdered
at the hands of terrorists
operating in the barrio El Dorado district.
Roving bands of Sandinista hooligans
have made the streets of Managua
unsafe for our peace-loving citizens.
Our deepest sympathies are extended
to the friends and family of Mr Grazier.
Our international press corps
is herewith informed
that all necessary steps
will be taken to protect its safety.
Mr Kittle has prepared
statements for you.
Thank you.
l have the statements here
if you'd like to come up and get them.
- Can you get me a taxi?
- There are no taxis, sir. No cabs, sir!
Claire, l'm sorry.
- Did you hear from Russel?
- Nobody has.
- Do you wanna help me find him?
- Claire, there's fighting all over the city.
Jesus Christ, Claire.
A human tragedy. What can l say?
Fuck off, Hub.
Muevan la puerta!
Es el fotógrafo yanqui.
There's nobody here.
You, look in there, and you, over there.
Revisen todo.
Nobody there.
No hay nadie.
Private Garcia, is he there?
ls he there or not?
ls he or isn't he?
- No, he's not there.
- Let's go.
Agarren más municiones.
Russel!
Russel!
Alex?
The Guardia did it.
l've got pictures.
Let's go.
Amigo, hola.
Do you control this area?
Who knows?
Let's get out of sight for a minute.
Move! Move or l'll shoot.
Muévete. Muévete.
Muévete!
Who are they?
They are friends.
-  Quiénes son?
- They are friends.
Son amigos. Amigos.
Shut up or we'll kill all of you.
Which one? Him or him or her?
Kill all of them now!
Here we are.
Shut up! Murderer!
The boys are confused.
They think l had their family killed.
- You are a murderer.
- Murder! Murder is a word for criminals.
l protect the stability of a continent.
- Son of a bitch!
- Pigs!
- Please.
- And you got caught by boys.
Yes. Poets too, l imagine.
ls your recorder on?
Kill her!
Yes.
Good. l have a speech to make.
- Who are you?
- They are journalists.
-  Periodistas?
- Sí.
Take a picture as l blow his head off.
No. No photo.
Keep your hands up.
l like you people,
but you are sentimental shits.
You fall in love with the poets.
The poets fall in love with the Marxists.
The Marxists fall in love with themselves.
The country is destroyed with rhetoric,
and in the end we are stuck with tyrants.
Shut up, you bastard!
Calma.
Somoza, he is a tyrant too,
of course, a butcher.
But finally, that is not the point, you see.
lf we wish to survive,
we have a choice of tyrants.
And for all the right reasons,
your poets chose the wrong side.
Shut up! Take the picture now!
- No. No picture.
- Yes!
Your picture of Rafael was brilliant,
but l am alive and better-looking.
A good-looking Frenchman,
with a sympathetic face,
is murdered in cold blood
while fighting for the survival
of Europe and America.
You will have another magazine cover.
- What are these bastards saying?
- l don't know!
Let's kill them all.
Muy complicado.
Take the picture or get out!
- You chose the wrong side.
- ln 20 years we will know who is right.
Get out!
Are you going to take the picture as the
bullet enters the skull or as it comes out?
- Shut up!
- Don't move!
lt's just a story.
Shut your mouth.
They say that if somebody is holding
a gun on you, you shouldn't stop talking.
That's the theory.
Who knows?
Maybe it's a good thing
that l talk too much.
We gotta get outta here.
The whole fuckin' army's looking for me.
Yeah. They're not looking for me.
Let me take the film. lf l can't make it
back to the hotel, l'll come back here.
Look, it's more dangerous
being with you than being alone.
Right.
Get the flag. We'll put the film in it.
ls anyone there?
- What is it?
- l need to get this to the hotel.
Please come in.
Russel!
Russel?
Russel!
- Have you seen this man?
- No, l haven't.
Abran paso!
Lo ha visto?
No.
..Russel Price,
un bien conocido foto-journalista
que estaba viajando con Grazier.
El presidente Somoza
ha cambiado su posición anterior,
y ahora dice que el tiroteo fue accidental.
Tacho, como Somoza es conocido
popularmente, ha regresado...
Journalist?
You knew the man who was killed?
and now one Yankee.
Perhaps now Americans will be
outraged at what is happening here.
Perhaps they will.
Maybe we should have killed
an American journalist 50 years ago.
Somoza flees to Miami, Florida
with the bodies of his father and brother.
- Have you seen the Guardia?
- No, l haven't.
- ls the war over yet?
- l don't know.
The tanks are coming!
Russel?
Rafael! Rafael! Rafael!
Rafael! Rafael! Rafael!
Hey, Price.
Hey, Pricey!
lt's all over, huh? We made it.
l like this music.
What the hell are you doin' here?
lt's a free country.
l mean, it's free now, anyway.
Nica libre. Rum and Coke, no ice.
You want some?
You aren't gonna turn me in, are you?
See you in Thailand.
Do you think we fell in love
with too much?
l'd do it again.
