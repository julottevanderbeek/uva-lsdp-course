- Worse. He is a teacher! - Are you, Mr. Bratt.? I'm sorry.

English has long passed strictures.
I did not know to be secret agent was so nice.
Have unpleasant moments.
Speaking of which, school starts the day after tomorrow.
- I do not know how I go. - Me neither.
In Germany no longer wear silk stockings.
I'll teach her room. He's upstairs.

Tomorrow, no. Now!
What are your orders?

It's safer that way.
- Can I come in? - Come in.
- Good Morning. - Good Morning.
Have breakfast in my room. The view is nice.
I have more important things to do than admire the view.
It's okay.
En fin. ¿El plan?
Sinking 15 of these ships.
How?
Will tell him.
Who is?
A British officer resentful. He was in command of a destroyer.
- I lost in an accident. - How?
An incorrect order. He had drunk.
Traitor and drunk, a pride for the British navy.
- Where did it happen? - In Cyprus.
- HMS Connaught. 16 February. - ¿Lo knew?
- Clear. The commander Ashington. - Lieutenant. They withdrew the vessel.
- Where did you meet her? - In Leith, a month ago.
- And she found it valuable. - Pretty.
- For who? - Germany.
Just to Germany?
And for me.
I guess I'll know.
Down in a minute.
Capitán Hardt.
Let's sit down and learn to know.
- Give a drink and relax. - I'd rather go to work.
Drink when you can is my motto.
Whenever you can concentrate on the job.
The Germans are all the same.
Close the curtains and take the maps. See if we started.
Three years we are helplessly in Keith ago.
- We face in Jutland. - And they have not gone further.
- You mean ... - Okay, we both win.
With the fleet around the corner,
and that the large fleet in Scapa watches,
- It is impossible to get to Ireland ... - I know. What is your plan?
Two squadrons of cruisers will sweep southward.
I know that too. It is routine.
Do not you give anything to know when, where and how?
- Do you know? - Save time, but get.
- Which squad? - The 1st and 5th.
The route?
Here it is, in pencil. East of Swona.
If we leave them to step ...
- En Sandwick Bay. - En Sandwick Bay,
- Would sink a few. - Exactly.
They could change the path, but I would warn.
- Who? - My brother. He is captain of flags.
- And also ...? - No. Is fraternal confidence.
When will the operation take place?
Tomorrow. Past. It is not known. But I tell you.
We can not cease blocking an assumption.
It is not an assumption. Come out of the sea.
- The date? - I get it.
It would be the biggest defeat of the war.
So we agree?
I hope so.
- Until the next meeting. - Until the next meeting.
Pórtate them.
- Mr Ashington, what is your boat? - The old Warspite.
Did not go with the squad?
- They're fixing it, as always. - A shame.
Look children. When looking at this map, you see that our country
He is the protector of countries and bigger colonies.
I know I read in like but mi is the German public.
- I'm about to become British. - And how do I continue?
Talk of the empire where the sun never sets.
You have to explain it.
¿Va west of this al setback?
I worry. Sure children know.
Sure you can teach more important things.
How to penetrate an enclave as Gibraltar.
How to cheat British and German officers.
Things that are not taught in school.
That would be evening classes for adults.
It's night and I'm an adult.
But it's not my student.
What happened to Miss. Burnett?
- You know "Red Riding Hood"? - Beat well.
So this is different.
- Did you have an accident? - Exactly.
- Was this? - Obey orders in my service.
What a service!
Have you ever sunk a ship unarmed?
- It's different! - It's the same.
Why do I despise? Obey orders, like you.
We do not choose the missions.
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.
Where is the key?
Here.
Good night.
Thank you, children. Very pretty. Now you may go.
- Thank you very much. Good Morning. - Good Morning.
- Any news? - What I have. They start tomorrow.
- What time? - 7:00 a.m.
- No change? - No.
- Tonight is the meet. - Be ready for ten.
- Today? - Clear. Good job.
- What's wrong here? - Fraulein Thiel's coming with me.
- I'm the Reverend. Hector Mathews. - Oh yeah? I mean, how are you?
You. Forgive. I'm John Harris. I'm looking for the school.
- What's it going? -. Ms. Burnett is my fiancee.
I did not know he had intercourse with the Episcopal Church.
Soon will.
If you are going to stay on the island could stay at my residence.
- It will save good money. - Appreciate it.
- And bring your fiancee to dinner. - Okay ...
If I get your coupons meat, we will prepare a roast.
- The carry in my pocket but ... - Let me.
At 7:30 o'clock.
- Ud. querrá to stay. - ¿Y matter what? See you in ...
- I only see one thing: orders. - Where are they?
- Here. - What do you mean there?
What are those orders?
Once you complete mission. Has boarding.
- Once completed? - That's it.
What has been completed?
Without their submarines find our squad?
- He's right. - No two ways about it.
I'll pass the message to Schuster. We leave tomorrow night.
That already makes more sense.
- Who is it? - It is not closed.
I'm so sorry. Guess I will have another room.
Come in.
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.
- It is difficult to find a room. - Pretty.
- Íbamos to have tea. - You are welcome.
Thanks but came to find my fiancee, Miss. Burnett.
- Are you here? - Milk and sugar?
- Very friendly. - Let me help you.
I appreciate that. It weighs a little.
- How are you? - Sit.
Thank you.
I should warn that I have come, right?
- Your tea. - Thank you.
I'll give it a voice.
Here we do not like the voice rises.
As you wish ...
You'll be surprised to find me here, right?
- Tart? - No thanks.
I brought this gramophone, and lots of new albums.
Do you know the "March of the Soldier"?
It's big, but has a lovely sound.
I do not recognize this band of metal.
- What is it? - The Iron Cross, second class.
¿Second class? Are you. Prisoner of war?
Yo no. Ud. sí.
OMG.
They have not arrived!
In times of war, being late is a criminal waste.
- The meat will burn. - I bring.
I will not wait more.
Rev. disappoint me. Harris.
Bless these foods that we are going to take. Amen.
- Son macaroni. - I think you owe me an Expli ...
- Wait to come back here. - Why?
- 'Stay here! - Those hurry.
- Who is it? - The Rev.. Matthews and his wife.
Excuse me.
- Good night. - A dreadful night for visitors.
Social obligations are before time.
- It's a compliment. - It's not. We waited an hour.
- Out? - A table.
- At the table? - Exactly.
- He's upset about the meat. - There is nothing material.
If you., And Rev.. they could not come, should have sent a message.
- Do we expect? - Do not you got the invitation?
- I'm afraid not. - I'm surprised not to tell.
- But it's true. - Strange.
If it were your fiance, to see her after so long,
- I forget everything. - Do you have an explanation?
- When he arrived, he suffered a stroke. - Attack?
Yes, it was suffocating. He could not speak.
Are you sick? What a relief.
I booked a room and did not understand her not to come.
He's gone to bed an hour ago.
- It is the most sensible. - An embarrassing situation.
Ms.. Matthews should stay tonight.
- It should? - There's no need.
As Reverend, I say that your position ...
- What future wife? - People might talk.
In time of war? Do not worry about me.
My conscience calls me talk to the Reverend. Harris.
I will not bother to satisfy his conscience.
Good night.
But ... ¿Me is challenging?
Not at all. But in my house decide.
We'll see what you think the Education Committee.
- Bye Bye. - Bye Bye.
I understand, but his conscience bothered him all night. Bye Bye.
- Good night. - Good night.
¿Sandwick Bay? What a journey!
- At 2 h. will be there. - I hope so.
Te are 15 submarines in order to spend a ni torpedo.
- All right. - We could sink a few.
Tomorrow will come and pick us up.
Yes, sir. Too bad the battle is lost
- For that woman. - It's not your business.
- Good luck! - Thank you.
- Schuster! - Sir?
I almost forgot.
- What is it? - Butter.
- I'm sorry. - Come on.
- Did you send the message? - He's on his way.
Often cold. I'm in bad shape.
I was left sitting in the bushes.
I do not usually entertain British officials
however helpful they have been.
- How does it feel to make history? - I prepare a hot coffee.
It has been an exhausting night, you would be better going to bed.
To you. Still has some way, why do not you give an example?
A little touch, do not you see that we want to be together?
In the hours of the day will be. If you are wondering Where you walk.
- I'll have another drink. - Certainly.
Tomorrow have all day to say goodbye.
Good night.
- Do not stop until he gets it. - Sleep well.
Much better.
- Not given choice. - He leaves happy.
Take your whiskey and is convinced her love for him.
In a minute I'm going to bed.
No, no. I want to talk to you. And make that coffee.
It's 4:00. We'll talk tomorrow.
Tomorrow? We will not have another chance like this.
The work is done.
In one hour the submarines are waiting and two attack.
And in a week, you., And I will be in Kiel,
celebrating.
Then on to Berlin. I see us eating at the Hotel Adlon.
Will the Iron Cross in your bag and be the only girl in Berlin
with silk stockings.
I'm going to bed.
I have served many commanders and not admire none to you.
- What will you do back home? -. Has told you.
- Travel to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. - And after Berlin?
Jobs. Another island. Another Ashington.
And another captain Hardt?
Perhaps. Let me pass.
Commander Thiel, just to get a win.
A good commander is to celebrate with his men.
If I'm in charge, I order you to let me pass.
David.
Jill.
- They have been horrible 10 minutes. - And for me.
- Now it's all over. - Yes, dear.
Who would think to go out without a coat?
Do not run these risks.
- Where is he? - Upstairs in his room.
You are amazing.
Lord.
Agente Bob Pratt, señor.
- Who I am? - Commander Blacklock.
When the patrol arrives wait for the signal.
- Where is your bracelet? - I saved it in the pocket
for if there were German spies.
- Keep your eyes open. - Yes, sir.
David, you do not arrestarás until I'm gone, right?
Trust us. For now it's all right here.
Déjalo volver a su boat for that fight.
You might find out who the real Thiel and Ashington.
- You hear that? - What is it?
The flotilla of destroyers.
They have been carrying bombs all night.
Within hours, they will not be underwater in Sandwick Bay,
only a few grease stains adrift.
- I'm getting dizzy. - Here.
Drink this.
You'll make history.
Ya lo sé.
Go get your stuff and go directly to St. Magnus,
leave in an hour.
Nothing is mine. Everything is Anne Burnett.
Well, come on.
- I'll bring the detainee half an hour. - Yes, sir.
Do not want the hassle we save him?
No. I have personal reasons to do so.
Take care of her.
I'll be on the bridge. You can use my cabin.
- Very friendly. - It's small, but cozy.
- It's all yours. - Thank you.
Okay ...
Walter, oiga.

There is a pastor in school. Let go and wait for me.
He will be angry. Stay here.

DO LEVEL IN STROMNESS
Drop moorings!
- Wait. Comes a passenger. - Yes, sir.
Mr. Harris, I'll tell the commander that has embarked.
If all fue as predicted,
Why I have not seen the Rev.. Harris?
We tied him in school because he was a nuisance.
Was lucky not to suffer the same fate.
- Blacklock would not have hesitated. - I can not understand.
I will help. The Germans tried to kill Anne Burnett
to put in place a spy. Fortunately, they failed.
The shot of a cliff, but patrol boat rescued.
With your help, we arrested the spy in Thurso.
Then we replace with a counter-spy.
A trial, we found a brave volunteer,
the you. known as Anne Burnett.
The Anne Burnett school is not the teacher,
Anne Burnett or German.
- It's no Anne Burnett. - Correct.
- Who is it? - That's a military secret.

- The German? - Harris wears clothes.
Excuse me.

They ran into one of its mines.
One of his ...?
- Do you think you are funny? - You can not.
Right, march!

Too young.

At the moment, yes. Where is the radio?

He did not leave the house no German.
The patrol took over, and there were nine.

What will you do with the boat?
Head for the submarines will Sandwick.

- It is full of mines. - We have to take the risk.
- It's not just about us. - This is the life of my classmates!

Listen. They are prisoners of war.
I do not want noise and panic.
Whoever disobeys orders will die.
With one exception.
- Be quiet! - Easy.
A19, A24, A7 have been to St. Magnus. Follow your route.
There are eight Germans.
- You should go home. - Thank you.
Si se unen a Hardt...
- A17 message. - They have not seen. Is delayed.
He changed his route between A7 and A17.
Sandwick Bay.
My wife is on board.
- Auxiliary. - Mr.
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.
I'm sorry. You will have to forget personal matters.
Sir?
The Germans are aimed at Sandwick Bay in St. Magnus.
Blacklock will teach your route possible.
It goes by Seitha Wound to cut him off.
- You have to sink? - If you do not give up.
Captain!
Captain!
- Walter, are you there? - What?
In this we follow the speed.
Kill the bearings.
Much effort for engines. I do not know how to endure.
- Where are we going? - To the east.
Soon we will leave British waters.
- We depend on providence. - Do not,
someone who despises your life and theirs.
It is my fault. Forget that we were at war,
which kills any human feeling.
- Can you go faster? - It's the most.
The old man is deaf or dumb. Or pursued by a submarine.
Out.
Out!
We should see it anymore.
- Have they changed course. - I think not.
Look, Felix. Not the St. Magnus?
It is. What do you do here?
- Sospechoso. - Would chupado.
We can not spend the torpedoes.
But a pair of shells together.
Prepárense to emerge.
On your marks. Objective: steamship.
Quite the bandera inglesa.
¡El U29!
¡Schuster! ¡Schuster!
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!
¡Soy yo, Hardt!
Someone makes us signals.
H - A
Fire!
They opened fire after that point.
We should take a look. Change of address.
Lifeguards catch floats.
Stay calm.
A lifeboat!
Keep calm and put on the floats.
Donald, stop what you're doing and go up. Hurry.
There it is.
Take out the cannons.
- Do not shoot, it's sinking. - They go to the boats.
Look, a destroyer!
Immersion!
He bombed a submarine. 's Shoot.
Objective: submarine.
Loading launched deep!
TURN OFF ENGINE
- Dispersaos. - Sin Ud. no.
That's an order!
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.
My own submarine sank us.
Venga, Miss. Fast.
Why are you here? It should also go.
If you do not mind, I'd rather stay.
As you. Want.
Captain, do you have a cigarette?
No, but a pipe.
- No smoke a pipe. - A poco late to learn.
It's there. I see.
