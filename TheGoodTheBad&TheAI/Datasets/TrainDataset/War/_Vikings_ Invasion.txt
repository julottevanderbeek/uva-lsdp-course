Is this what you really want,
brother?
Why do we fight each other?!
If we raided together,
we would not need to kill
anymore of our young folk.
My mind tends the same way
as Ragnar's.
I will raid with you.
I have to leave.
Everyone hates me here.
But you were going to leave
and not even say goodbye to me?
Who is Aslaug?
She is a Gotaland princess.
Did you have sex with her?!
Yes.
I don't love her.
But this woman is carrying my child.
You must accept her.
You insult and humiliate me.
I have no choice but to leave you.
I'm coming with you.

Ubbe!
- Modir!
- Come here.
__
Let's go find out what your
your brother Hvitserk is doing?
All right.
The axe is much better
than the sword because...
- TORSTEIN: How?
- And the range!
EVERYONE:
Hello, Floki. You made it.
- Helga.
- Torstein.
Torstein, you're standing
in the way of the fire.
As usual.
Hello, Priest.
Ooh!
Why do you still say such things?
So where is he?
Where is our Earl?
Behind you.
- Hey, Ubbe! Hey!
- Hello, Floki.
We've kind of missed you.
Well, I've been busy like a dwarf,
building your new boats,
Ragnar Lothbrok,
even in the ice and the snow.
So busy,
yet he still have so much time
to complain.
FLOKI:
The boats are nearly finished.
I think we all want to know
where we'll be raiding this summer.
Every year, all your people wonder
when you will order another raid West
and every year you disappoint them.
I've even heard some people say
that Earl Ragnar is becoming
like Earl Haraldson.
Let me put their minds at ease.
You should.
Welcome, everyone.
As you all know,
it has taken a long time
to prepare ourselves.
To build our ships,
and to replace the young men
that we lost to the plague.
But now, now we are ready,
and this summer
we shall finally go West again.
Yay! Yeah!
We will return to England,
for that land was so generous
to us the last time.
But this time, we shall not go alone.
For King Horik and Jarl Borg
have agreed to join us.
And perhaps we will not have
to return so quickly,
but stay in their land for awhile,
explore it, maybe even winter there.
Who knows?
But, I tell you,
these are interesting times.
The world is changing
and we must change with it.
We must act together,
for everyone's sake.
And now that I have
put your minds to rest,
who is hungry?
TOWNSFOLK:
Thank you.
I've never seen you before.
What is your name?
My name is Hild, my lord.
Where are you from?
- Upsalla.
- Upsalla.
Thank you.
What were you talking about
with her?
We were talking about movements
in the shield-wall.
Girl, bring me some more food.
- I have to eat for two.
- Yes, my lady.
How old are you?
I don't know.
Old enough, I'd say.
Be careful who you choose
to be familiar with.
Yes, my Lady Aslaug.
What is it?
What is what?
You...
You are acting very...strangely.
Oh, you think it is strange
for a pregnant woman
to want her husband
to be supportive and kind?
No.
Then why do you think
I'm acting "strangely"?
I don't know.
You don't know that you're
flirting with other women
and showing them
you want to bed them?
I am not doing that.
You're saying such things
because of your condition.
My "condition"?!
Tell your beautiful mother
that I am not doing what she thinks.
Yes, you are.
Women know these things.
I know it especially,
because I have certain gifts.
Gifts?
I see things others cannot.
Ah!
You mean you are a Volva?
Seeress? I may be.
They say that Volvas practice
forbidden sexual rites.
Shall I stay awake?
The fact is, you want to sleep
with that girl,
even though she is barely
above a slave girl.
That is such an insult to me.
I do not want to sleep
with that girl,
whatever her name is.
Good night, little one.
And now I'm going to sleep.
I won't let you sleep
until I have told you this:
I will bear you another son.
If you like, you can feel him
stirring in my belly.
But, because you treat me
like an idiot,
I make this prophecy.
My father killed the dragon Fafnir,
and our new son will be born
with the image of the serpent in his eye.
This much I know.
SEER:
What is it you want?
The gods have given me sons,
as they promised.
But I want to know
what the future holds.
what will become of them?
The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok
will be spoken of
as long as men have tongues to speak.
They will enjoy that much fame?
One of them will marry
the daughter of a king.
Another will discover
and sail around the sea
that has no tides.
All this, and more, have I foreseen.
Then they will have more fame than I,
their father?
What about Bjorn?
What about my son Bjorn?
What of him?
Is he alive?
It was of him I was speaking.
Will I ever see him again?
You ask too many questions.
I have said enough.
- See for yourself. Good salted fish.
- Not today.
You're a disgrace.
I have lost everything!
My sons, my husband,
finally my daughter.
I am not going to lose you.
Yesterday your brother spoke
of the summer's raid.
He's going west again,
with King Horik.
You must ask him
to take you with him.
Look at me!
You will look better
if you have something to believe in.
I am giving you a choice, Rollo.
Go and speak with your brother,
or...
or take this blade,
push it into your ribs right now.
Stay in hell for all eternity.
ASLAUG:
One day, Hvitserk,
you will ride a horse, just like this.
Ragnar.
You should all leave.
- Come on, boys.
- Ubbe, go with your mother.
I said everyone.
Well, I just thought...
Everyone.
Well, are you going to take a seat?
So where have you been
for so long, brother?
Carrying around my heavy heart,
cursing the gods,
cursing myself,
and then drinking ale until
I almost forgot everything.
So why are you here now?
I am your brother.
You chose to fight against me.
I remember when we were boys,
we often fought against each other.
Isn't that always the way
with brothers?
They hate and love each other
all the time.
You could have killed me,
like you killed One-Eye.
I could never have killed you.
Tell me, why should I
ever trust you again?
Because I ask you to.
Shouldn't you be asking
for forgiveness
after everything you have done?
I ask only for the opportunity
to regain your respect,
to fight beside you again in battle.
I have nothing.
You have suffered.
But many people suffered more
because of what you did.
Let me think on it.
Then I'll give you my decision.
You broke my heart.
MEN AND WOMEN:
MAN:
Good!
MAN:
Use your fear!
Not bad for a shield-maiden.
Do you ever miss England?
No.
Sometimes.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
I don't want to stay here
with the old people.
Good.
Perhaps you will come in useful.
We will need the help of all the gods,
including yours.
- Ungh!
- Ooh!
MAN:
That's better!
- MAN: Yah!
- WOMAN: Ungh!
It is one thing to use a weapon,
but another to kill.
Ungh!
Never hesitate.
RAGNAR:
King Horik!
Welcome indeed.
Earl Ragnar, my great friend.
I heard you came by horse.
Where are your ships?
My ships are being prepared.
I could not wait.
I have waited an eternity already.
Ja. I said to my sons,
hmm, I have to set off.
I cannot even wait for the ice to melt.
My ships will arrive soon enough.
And I look forward to getting
to know your sons
and introducing mine.
There is someone here
that you will well remember.
FLOKI:
Come here, Ubbe.
I can see, King Horik,
that you're not too...
delighted to see me,
but I hope you're not surprised.
We all made an agreement to raid together
and I've come to honor it.
The last time we met, Jarl Borg,
I had the distasteful task
of burying many of my kinsmen
and friends.
And for the past four years,
I've been paying you profits
from my lands.
But still, it is true,
I am not surprised to see you.
Good.
Is this not Rollo,
the brother who fought against us?
Yes.
And you spared his life?
The gods spared his life.
What is your decision?
I accept you back, Rollo.
I acknowledge you as my brother,
but I forbid you to raid with us.
I accept your judgment.
MAN:
Drink to the gods!
JARL BORG:
King Horik.
KING HORIK:
Ahh!
I have to tell you, Princess Aslaug,
it is the greatest privilege and honor
to be seated beside you,
the daughter of Sigurd.
Thank you, King Horik.
Such a compliment,
from a man like you,
is always welcome.
Mm. Oh, it is true,
I have also slain dragons,
just like your father.
Unfortunately, like most men,
the dragons were only inside my head.
How old are you, Ari?
Seventeen. Nearly eighteen.
Will this be your first raid?
Yes. I can't wait
to prove myself in battle.
I want my father to be proud of me.
I have a son about your age.
Where is he?
I would like to meet him.
I do not know where he is.
That is by his choice.
I should never have mentioned him.
Drink.
I have made a decision.
I do not wish Jarl Borg
to raid with us.
But we had an agreement.
Why not?
Why do you not want
your brother beside you?
Because you don't trust him enough.
It is the same for me with Jarl Borg.
I cannot bring myself
to trust him completely.
You must inform him of our decision.
- Skol.
- Skol.
MAN:
Come look!
Are you jealous?
Hmph! They won't even
make it out of the Fjord.
They are beautiful, King Horik.
Mm-hm.
Jarl Borg, thank you for waiting.
So... when do we set sail?
Forgive me, Jarl Borg,
but we have decided
not to seek your help.
I thought we had an agreement.
It is not my desire
to break that agreement.
Believe me,
I wish it to remain intact.
- But on this occasion...
- On this occasion?
On this occasion,
the silver thread is slit,
the golden cup breaks
and the pail is smashed at the spring.
I know much about what happens here
that you do not.
I know things about Ragnar Lothbrok
you do not know.
I knew his first wife, Lagertha,
and their son Bjorn.
I know his strengths,
and I know his weaknesses.
Why should I need to know
his weaknesses?
Because he is your his ally.
It is always a strength
to know the weaknesses
of your friends,
is it not?
I might be interested
in what you know.
But how do I know
you and I can trust each other?
Hmm?
Your brother gives with one hand
and takes away with the other.
How many times must you suffer
his injustices?
If only you had stayed strong,
we would have overcome.
And now he does with you
as he wishes.
It's terrible to witness the state
into which you have fallen...
you, Rollo,
the greatest warrior.
What do you want?
Abandon your brother for good.
You will never be anything here.
Why would you stay?
What can you find?
Myself.
Yourself?
Yourself?!
If you want to find yourself...
You're a fool.
Yes.
But someday I hope to be wise.
MAN 1: We can take three more!
MAN 2:
We can take both of them!
You'll have need of these!
MAN 3:
It can't come soon enough!
MAN 4: That's my axe,
so keep it with me!
MAN 5:
Okay, get it.
All right.
Hey.
Now you be a good boy,
and you do what your mother tells you.
Most of the time.
Hey. Ooh!
I love you.
Good boy.
Farewell, my wife.
And you, Sigurd.
We will make a sacrifice to Thor,
but I believe you shall
cross the sea safely.
I shall get word to you
as soon as I can.
I will miss you... your pride.
So will I.
CAPTAIN:
Hoist sails!
- WARRIOR 1: Heave!
- WARRIOR 2: Hoist sails!
- WARRIOR 1: Heave! Heave!
- CAPTAIN: Hoist!
WARRIOR 1: Heave!
CAPTAIN: Dig in the oars! Oars!
Hold!
Steady now!
Row!
What do you think?
That we ought to be near land
by now.
What now?
We wait.
Oh!
MAN:
Aesir is angry!
MAN:
Odin, help us!
You having fun yet, Horik?
It's going to tear, get it down!
What is that?
That's the sound of waves
hitting rocks.
Set the oars! Prepare to pull away!
Pull away!
Quickly!
You asked to see me?
Yes, sit.
We have not made friends.
It is my fault.
But, if you want to,
we can be friends now.
After all, we a family
and Ragnar has forgiven his brother.
I would be honored
to be considered your friend.
Let's not fool one another.
You were once where I am now.
Perhaps you wish to return
to this status?
If so, I don't blame you.
But in the meantime,
let's not be enemies.
Women should stick together more.
That's true.
And we should rule!
All things would be better.
Friend.
Friend.
We've been blown miles off course,
who knows where we are?
The gods know, Priest.
What I want to know...
Where are all the ships?
How many do you see?
Only four.
Some of the others
may have been scattered.
Or they all might all have foundered.
Father! Father, come see!
What did I tell you, boy?
Land!
I told my sons
Ragnar always finds land!
Where do you suppose we are?
I build boats Ragnar,
you're the navigator.
Ha!
Ragnar, Ragnar. There's fish.
WARRIOR 1:
...tell you about it.
WARRIOR 2: You were the strong man
at the back of the ship, weren't you?
WARRIOR 3:
Learn to tell a joke!
WARRIOR 1:
Oh, you're gonna need your fill, lad.
WARRIOR 2: I feel like I'm going
to have nice sleep now.
That's all I need.
Ha!
MAN:
SHIELD-MAIDENS:
SHIELD-MAIDEN:
He's paying no heed.
SHIELD-MAIDENS:
Agh! Agghhh!
Ari! Ari!
Shields!
- Shields!
- Get down! Get down!
Priest! In!
SHIELD-MAIDEN:
Together! Together!
ARI:
ARI:
- They're everywhere.
- But how many?
ATHELSTAN:
ARI:
Erlendur, do not be dismayed.
Meet everything head-on.
Whether we live or die today
is in the hands of the gods.
They already know
if we sup with them tonight,
so fear not.
Fight well, and if you fall,
surely Odin will take you
to Valhalla.
WARRIORS:
Odin!
Agh!
Ungh!
Agh! Aghhh! Aghhhh!
Agghhh!
- Horik is in trouble.
- What?
- Horik is in trouble.
- Then help him!
Aggghhhhh!
Aghhhhh!
Perhaps he can strike
them dead with his holy book!
Agggghhhhhh!
WARRIOR:
Meet death!
Go help Horik!
Torstein! We're going around!
Agghhh!
Agh!
- Open!
- Open!
- Close!
-
Aghhhh!
Ragnar!
Aghhhh!
WARRIOR: That's it. Rip it off!
Rip it off!
You did not hesitate today.
Take it, if you want.
WARRIOR:
RAGNAR:

What have you heard
about King Ecbert?
That he's just like you.
What on earth has caused you
to bring your muddy boots
into my bathhouse?
Forgive me, sire.
But the Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.
They defeated a large force
of our men.
They are here.
