In mid-nineteenth century on the west
border of the Russian Empire,
at the confluence of the rivers Bug and Muhavec,
Brest fortress was built.
Powerful fortifications, fortress system,
ramparts, ditches and water obstacles,
were the impregnable fortress.
A century later, the emergence of new species
weapons, defensive properties of the fortress
are reduced to mimimum ...
But not people who have defended it.
Almost 20 years after the war,
the world is from the book by Sergey Smirnov
I learned the truth about achievement
defenders of the fortress.
earned the title of "Fortress-Hero".
Dedicated to the memory of
heroes of Brest Fortress
and to all who have
defending our homeland.

Cancel the reservation!
Comrade Commissar,
I am telling you as your:
Forbidden to annihilate
Reservations!
We received a directive from headquarters:
Only by special order.
So you will not?
- Perhaps it is good.
Why do you want there,
when all they want from there?
What exactly does this
do you mean?
Hell.
Rights desert.
To die with envy!
German cargo?
Hello, comrade commissars!
Hello, Nicholas.
Film drive?
- Yeah, I'm driving.
'Hey ... Come on, come quickly!
Come on, come on!
C'mon!
C'mon!

Hruš, what are you doing?
Where bleneš?
Comrade Lieutenant, this is
some kind of "Swan Lake".
Healthy-living.
- Hi-alive.
Zina, thank you.
And so ...
And when you think,
to start a war with Germany?
Seriously ask?
Commanded to
investigate your case.
The expansion ... So ...
... Panic about rumor
War with the Allies.
I believe and I see that you are
convinced Communists and honorable man.
How could that happen to you, Pyotr
Mihailovic, characterized as a panic?
Ask those who have me nabedili.
Help me, Pyotr Mihailovich.
I have a low rank,
little authority,
and assignments on the throat.
I see you with
these have nothing.
Who sow panic in the garrison?
What do you think?
In particular I called you here to talk,
as they say - in private.
Tell who, Comrade Major?
- I.
Nonsense to think that
Germans will soon rush.
Nothing that I did not like
heard from someone else.
In garrison, there is no panic,
Comrade Weinstein.
Sleep peacefully.
Here Lieutenant see ...
If you rush, you will find yourself in the environment.
Garrison of 8,000 men.
Such a torrent of people will fail to
pass only through the North gate.
Wife, children, aunts loaded their
things, blanket, towels ...
Sanatorium, his mother ...!
Much of the garrison should be
performed outside the fortress,
Places to station units.
That's what I, a war commander,
which has passed the two wars, I say.
I will continue to speak.
A whole army of the fourth? Pjotr
Mihailovic, would not guess that leave us?
We will not be left hanging?
- It will not.
Not, if everyone is
where it should.
Soldiers in one place
Commanders on the second.
When there is a soldier without a commander,
there was panic.
These are basic things,
Comrade Lieutenant?
Quite understand you,
Pyotr Mihailovich.
I personally our conversation
I find very useful.
Of course, please
to keep it a secret.
For discussion of your case
determined on 27 June
Comrade Lieutenant,
allow to leave.
The film starts in the club ...
- Yes, of course.
Petya, it's time to enter!
- Ma stićićemo.
Where it needs to hurry ...
- Entrances.
Healthy-living!
"... Ju, ju, ju, ju ...
... Warmed up our iron ...
... I'm not jealous of another,
it will change ...
... Anyway, you will be mine,
thou shalt not escape me ...

wanted to tell you ...
Silence there!
Sonja? - Mmm ...
'Hey Sonja?
You will remain?

wanted to tell you ...
