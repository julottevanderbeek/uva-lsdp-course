"It is said, that everything around you
is getting quiet,
in the moment of death."
Take cover!
Open fire on my command.
We need to shoot.
On my command!
"That is Friedhelm, my brother."
"He won't be
much of a help anymore."
Episode 1:
"Six months ago
in Berlin
we said Goodbye
to our parents."
"A human live."
I expect you
to make us all proud.
Its about nothing less
than the future of Germany.
You've already proven yourself.
And you,
you stick to your brother.
Maybe something will
become of you.
You are going to take all of them?
Yeah, sure.
Hurry up, the girls are waiting.
Take care of yourself.
Wilhelm.
You bring him back to me.
Promise.
Promise!
I promise.
Bring the  another
on the house and the bill.
Then you call it a day.
Won't your soldier get a kiss?
If I fall tomorrow,
your heart will be broken.
If you fall,
then in the gutter only.
Good night.
Good night.
Greta.
And?
I made it.
I knew it. Come!
It's time to party.
With an A, what else.
Even though they wanted to trick me.
They asked me what
came after the Third Reich.
Nothing.
The millennial realm
remains eternally.
Just a few days until
I go to the front.
Did you tell him,
that you love him?
Stop it.
Dear Lord, you've got to tell Wilhelm.
We're at war,
life can be pretty short.
Do you want to wait until ?
These few months.
There they are.
All right,
I'm going to tell him today.
You can use my room.
Greta!
What?
Ladies.
Na.
Don't you have any luggage?
Luggage?
This man is a  -
he will be picked up.
I understand.
Where is Viktor?
Shalom, .
Shalom.
Where's your luggage?
"We were five. Five friends."
Since when do you have a bicycle?
Stolen.
"We wanted to bid our farewells,
before we parted ways."
To us. - To us.
- To us.
"We grew up in the same neighborhood
and knew each other,
since we were kids."
"We could not have been more different"
"But we were friends that
stick together."
"Charly, our baby of the family,
wants do do her duty
for the fatherland."
"She will work as a nurse
in a military hospital,
which follows my unit
behind the front."
"Viktor Goldstein."
"His father was an
in World War I and later
a well respected tailor."
"Viktor was supposed to
take over the business,
before it was shattered
in the ."
"This is his girlfriend Greta.
They are inseparable."
"Greta does not mind,
that their relationship is considered
to be racial defilement."
"She is going to be a star."
"The new Marlene Dietrich."
"My little brother Friedhelm."
"The bookworm,
who loves Rimbaud and Jünger."
"I admire him for his
intelligence and his sharp humor."
"For him, it's the first time."
"And here am I, Wilhelm Winter."
"."
"Deployment to Poland and France.
Tomorrow we'll be heading to Russia."
Friedhelm, give it to me!
The war will make
a man out of him.
The War will bring out
the worst of us.
If you lose, they'll say
it'll be our fault again.
This is no country for wimps and traitors.
Everyone has to make sacrifices.
Ah!
Wilhelm...
Hide.
No.
If they find out that you as a Jew
do not respect the curfew...
...you'd go to a camp
and we would go with you.
Same rights for everyone.
Selfishness is treason to the fatherland.
Isn't it?
Yes.
.
.
How can I help you?
May I?
A farewell party.
We're leaving for the east tomorrow.
Wilhelm Winter.
This is my brother Friedhelm.
Miss Charlotte
will serve as a nurse on the front lines.
You stay at the home front?
It seems there has been a call,
Somebody is listening to Swing.
With Jews.
With Jews?
We wouldn't tolerate something like that.
Teddy Stauffer.
I didn't know that
Swing was prohibited.
Your Name?
Greta Müller.
, Fräulein Müller.
Report yourself in the
Prinz Albrecht Straße 8.
To the .
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
A drink?
Yes.
What?
You flirted with him.
I saved you,
you .
Greta, we have to go.
Now? Charly wanted to...
That can wait.
The war is over on Christmas.
Yeah, let's vow.
We'll be here again on Christmas
here in this room.
Alive.
Christmas in Berlin.
Christmas in Berlin.
Christmas in Berlin.
I'm going to take another photo.
Go there.
There in front of the shelf.
Come on.
Here?
Yes, take a chair.
Friedhelm,
in front, next to Greta.
"We were five friends."
"We were young and we knew
that the future belonged to us."
"The whole World laid before us
We just had to grab it."
"We were immortal."
"We should know better soon."
"July 10th 1941."
"This war will be different
to all other wars before."
"It's a joy to push forward."
"The frenzy of speed.
To go further and further and further."
"The endlessness of space."
"Landscapes like we've never
seen before."
"Fields extending to the horizon."
"The sky so far and blue,
as if God wanted to bedazzle us
with the beauty of his creation."
Isn't that great?
Soon here will be German farms.
"My men are putting up flawlessly."
"On every mission
they're always at the forefront."
"Everyone except Friedhelm,
who everyone considers to be a coward,
who provokes me daily.
who I feel ashamed of."
How far is it to Moscow?
- About 700 Kilometers.
Let's drive through,
we're the greyhounds.
Breakfast on the Red Square
with vodka and caviar.
And how are you going to
become a hero then?
Didn't get a single Russian and
already wants to have won the war.
Well, if the Russians
surrender all the time?
Shall I shoot captives?
Winter here would rather
tell them poems.
Koch, how many do you have?
- Koch has at least ten already.
Then Freitag will send his wife
a postcard from the Red Square tomorrow.
It's not going to be that bad
You coming?
He's just going to give you a real ticking off.
And why should I report in
personally then?
I already testified.
I'd come with you,
but my train doesn't wait.
All right, I'll manage.
I'm sure you will.
Charly!
How do I look?
Like a movie star.
Miss Müller, please.
How are your friends?
Any news from the front?
Only victories.
So, you love Swing?
I like it modern.
Reich Secretary of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels
calls Swing
degenerate Nigger music.
We all... can be mistaken.
I agree with you.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
I've read your testimony.
You have sung?
Yes.
I have good connections
to state broadcasting.
Maybe something can be arranged.
That would be wonderful.
Marlene Dietrich...
We better shouldn't mention her.
Maybe you could sing
a song to me sometime?
Feigl.
Wilhelm.
Six kilometers northeast.
A pocket of resistance in a factory.
The company circumvents it
and continues.
You take your best men
and smoke it out.
Afterwards you'll advance to us.
- Jawohl.
Good luck.
There is a factory site Northeast of here
which has to be cleared...
Jawohl, Herr .
Then lets go!
Now it's hunting time!
Jawohl, .
Let's whack the Ivan.
Welcome,
I am Head Nurse Brigitte.
Hildegard.
Charlotte, my pleasure.
Come in.
I'll show you everything.
Here are the light casualties.
The severely injured
are in Section A.
In C are the contagious cases.
What did this used to be?
A station for women in child bed.
You know, why you're here?
To serve the German soldiers
and the Fatherland.
These are the new nurses.
Dr. Jahn.
I need you in the OR.
- Right away, Dr. Jahn.
No private contact with
the soldiers.
Especially not with the doctors.
If I hear about anything
I'll have you relocated immediately.
We represent
the German woman.
Serving the German soldiers.
Sounds promising.
Hildegard...
Four or five
up there in the factory.
Heavy MG, a Maxim.
We've told them to surrender.
Machine gun.
Were going with two squads,
I need two men.
And? Any volunteers?
Bartel, Schmidt, with the .
The LMG will provide suppressive fire.
Give Schmidt your rifle, you buffoon.
Freitag, Koch and Verbinsky with me.
Show them what you're made of!
!
- March!
Go, go, go, go!
Maybe we've got them all.
Or maybe they're calling
Comrade Stal- ...
Cover!
Schmidt, hang in there.
Bartel, go!
Go, go, go!
Shall I shoot?
Tell me, goddammit!
Goddamn Jewish bolshevik bastard!
Schneider, pull yourself together!
Schmidt could still be alive.
But he...
No buts! Get the MG from upstairs.
Jawohl, Herr .
Where is Freitag?
The medic is treating him.
Get the men to the truck.
He is one of those .
He will be interrogated, understood?
Bring them away!
You heard it, men.
Verbinsky.
Look!
That's for the cook sergeant.
I have a recipe for a beef soup
from my grandmother.
Come, Schnitzel.
Come. Come, Schnitzel.
Door opens
This seam here, it's skewed.
You have to open it up again.
And here, this cuff as well.
Is that everything?
A good work
will always stay a good work.
Were not humans anymore
for them
You're exaggerating.
Why should they set us aside?
When we've won the war,
everything will calm down.
Since when is this our war?
I have always served Germany
well and faithfully.
That will not be forgotten.
Are you still meeting that girl?
Why?
You know its prohibited.
Do you trust her?
Charly has written.
She says the war is splendid.
You grow stronger and harder.
And that we're going to
celebrate Christmas together.
Her military hospital is pretty close
to Wilhelm’s unit.
I'm going to the American
embassy tomorrow.
Why?
When I'm famous I'll make sure
that nothing happens to you.
Heinz Rühmann has
a Jewish wife as well.
Heinz Rühmann has divorced his Jewish wife.
What did he want?
Trust me.
Aaah!
Clamp.
Compress. Compress, quick!
This man is going to bleed out!
Scalpel.
Out! Out with you!
Get lost!
It seems the comrades have understood
the superiority of the Aryan race.
This is a present from the Führer.
Here. This is just the appetizer.
Afterwards there'll be Schnitzel.
And from the rest of the calf
there'll be ribs.
There will be soup, cook.
Jawohl, .
Friedhelm.
Why are you doing that?
What? Did I forgot to salute,
?
You damn well know what!
You never volunteer.
For the battle against the
international finance Jewry?
I thought one hero in the family
was enough.
Here I'm not your brother,
but your superior.
You know, what they think about you.
I could protect you from father.
- I never asked you for this
If you want me to be in a squad,
then assign me to one.
We drink a last time
to Schmidt.
Winter, you can carve a notch
into your stock as well.
If you need a kill,
just lend us your rifle.
Have you heard anything from Freitag?
- He is in the military hospital.
Nice Work, .
Thanks, .
Shall I inform Schmidt's parents?
I'm doing that right now.
The Russian Commissar was interrogated.
Completely fanatic.
He says, that we will never win.
He can be shot now.
The man is a prisoner of war.
You know the order.
The Soviets did not sign
the Geneva Convention.
Commissars are to be executed immediately.
That is not a normal war,
but an ideology.
Do it somewhere off,
so the men won't brutalize.
Here you are.
That can happen to anyone.
On my first operation I mixed up
the clamps and the scissors.
Did he make it?
Better make it two centimeters less.
Stay still.
And the neckline has to -
- reach the navel, I know.
Now stay still.
How long are you going to need?
All right, I'll stay still.
We can't continue like this.
There are rumors.
Rumors?
The Jews are sent to the East.
Have you been at the American embassy?
There are no new numbers.
Nobody gets out anymore.
Turn around.
Is it true that the  had to
execute the captive?
Yeah, that's true.
I hope, Stalin
holds out a little longer.
If the Russian capitulates tomorrow,
we'll never get to Moscow.
All of them would come home
with neat uniforms and medals.
And me? I'd just be a normal civilian.
Isn't it?
His whole life, my old man was
never further away from his
farm than ten kilometers.
And I am a thousand away.
And you know why?
The Führer said that
when the war is won,
there will be land here in the East
for every one of us.
I'll find myself a woman and stay here.
It will be fertilized quite well...
...with our blood.
Not with yours, Winter.
You are clever enough to duck your head,
as soon as the Ivan lets one off.
I just want to defer to you,
Schneider,
because you're that keen on getting
an Iron Cross, huh?
What?
What did you say?
Attention!
Call it off for today.
We're leaving at six.
It's going to be a hard day tomorrow.
Good night.
Go to sleep men,
tomorrow at six we'll be starting.
Goddammit... That with the ...
- Koch, he did it for us.
Not for me.
Otherwise one of us
would have had to have done it.
No, we wouldn't.
Do you think the Russian would
do it differently?
Maybe he is learning from us.
What did you learn?
Head nurse, I don't know...
Do you think it's enough,
to pledge loyalty to the Fuhrer,
and suddenly you're a nurse?
It won't happen again.
Bedpans and changing bandages.
There are Ukrainians waiting outside.
Select an assistant.
Who is experienced
with sick and injured people?
Who speaks German?
What is a syringe?
For injections.
In the hat?
Yes.
But if the hat is sick,
it won't be healed with just that.
You're experienced with sick people?
Yes.
Are you Jewish?
No.
Good, come with me.
The others...
Where were you last night?
Were you with that girl again?
What are you doing?
The newest idea by
Herrn Doktor Joseph Goebbels.
We all have to wear it now.
It's a law.
Even if it's wrong
a good German
does not violate the law.
Here, Thread No 3.
We are no Germans anymore.
Not for them.
Your arrogance
is going to cost you dear.
Viktor.
Viktor!
What are you doing?
That's no way to speak to your father.
There are so many things he doesn't understand anymore.
What?
It's all right.
Did you go to the embassy?
Yeah.
As soon as they have new quotas,
we're on board.
"September 19th, 1941."
"We're arresting
hundred thousands of Russians."
"But they don't give up,
they fight for every house."
"The twitching of a colossus,
just about to fall."
"I am optimistic, that we will
be back home by Christmas."
"And yet, its still a different
war from what I imagined."
Security service is conducting
a cleansing operation here.
The Order: Nobody gets in,
nobody gets out.
What do we do if somebody
wants to get through?
Shoot them.
You like to shoot, don't you?
When I was seven,
my dad got laid off.
So we went to the woods, hunting.
Only after the Führer came,
my dad got work again.
Here they are, finally.
Auxiliary police. Ukrainians.
There are children present.
...they are not allowed to kill civilians.
Hey!
Stoj! Let her go!
What does 'immediately' mean?
Sehtschassje.
- Sehtschassje.
What's going on here?
Let go!
Apustijt.
Apustijt.
.
.
That girl belongs to the security service.
Like all civilians this girl is
under the control of the Wehrmacht.
That's no civilian,
that's a Jew.
An order is an order.
And your orders are to lead
an Ukrainian mob?
How honorable
for a German officer.
This girl is your responsibility
until I have sorted out this issue.
Understood.
As you wish, .
.
I need papers.
For a friend,
who has to leave Germany.
For a friend?
Can you help him?
Do you mean the Jew?
Believe me, that problem
is going to settle itself.
What do you mean with that?
You better take care about
the things you know.
That problem is going to...
I said, only worry about the things
you really know.
Are you doing well with your program?
Yeah.
Good.
Believe me,
I'll make a star out of you.
Leningrad is trapped since
September 7th,
Kiev will fall any minute, and it's only
High command assumes that the Russians
will do a last, desperate attempt
to stop the Middle Army Group.
Use the time to get your material
and weapons back to shape.
You are dismissed, gentlemen.
Winter. A Word.
Are you mad?
A
of security service.
He executed a child in front of my eyes.
- Where there's Jews, there's partisans.
We are waging a war.
That is no war.
Yes it is. A new one.
In the name of the Fuhrer.
If we lose this war,
not even God will save us.
and most definitely not the Fuhrer.
Then we must not lose it
under any circumstances.
You're my best man.
You can make it far.
Don't ruin your career.
Wilhelm.
We should bid farewell to
the World as we know it.
She wasn't older than eleven.
It's about the purity of our race.
The Jews are tainting
the blood of the Germans.
Shut up, Schneider.
- It's in "Mein Kampf".
You can read?
We're defending our fatherland.
And what do you think are they doing
over there? Exactly the same thing.
.
.
I'm sorry about the mess earlier.
That was not necessary.
But the Jewish blood is so malicious,
it just spreads everywhere. Unpredictable.
That's why the Jews
are so dangerous.
Achtung!
Lilija, no!
Better Doktor Jahn.
Grab.
That's a broken upper arm.
We really have to wait for Dr. Jahn.
Not broken. Grab.
Here. Here!
Not broken.
What do we have here?
A dislocated shoulder.
We have put it right ourselves.
Good, nurse Charlotte.
You're slowly getting better.
Thanks.
Everything’s quiet.
Ivan is shitting his pants.
Don't think you can fall asleep, Winter.
Yeah.
A damn Russian sewing-machine.
They've turned off the lights.
Winter, put out the damn cigarette.
Put down the cigarette!
Winter, you moron!
You're gonna pay for this.
You did that on purpose, Winter!
We have a dashing Artillery  on the A.
What? These man haven't seen
a woman for weeks.
We're boosting the fighting power.
If they catch you...
She's so much better than us.
There's morphine missing again.
Maybe she's working with the partisans?
They say, they sneak into the
military hospitals at night.
and kill soldiers that can't
defend themselves in their beds.
And I even selected her...
You're not only a disgrace
for the company,
but for your brother as well.
Say, Schneider...
...did anyone ever tell you that...
...you look pretty Jewish?
Stop it!
Schneider, that's enough.
Get him to the medic.
Did you see her legs?
Yeah.
So?
So...
Yours are more beautiful.
So it is.
And I sing better than Marika Rökk
as well.
The box seats were sold out.
Darling, are you coming?
We're missing the newsreel.
They're saying the Russian
Southwest front broke down.
You were lucky.
We can release you soon.
In the Kiev cauldron,
five Russian armies have surrendered.
The military hospital
is going to be moved east.
As soon as the 60th arrives,
we're leaving.
The 60th? That's Wilhelm’s unit
isn't it?
Does he talk about me from time to time?
Yes.
Disembark, men.
Winter.
My orders are to...
I know, we'll be escorted.
The number of partisans
has considerably increased.
Because of our farsighted policy to consider
the indigenous population inferior.
Friedhelm.
How are you?
Good.
I'm happy to hear that.
Such a handsome  definitely
has a big lighter.
Wilhelm.
Charly.
How are you?
Good.
You look great.
Thanks.
Like a real front nurse.
So, already found the right one
from all these men?
Yes.
Farewell, Charly.
Take care of yourself.
Christmas in Berlin.
I have one hour.
There are rumors that Himmler is
going to enact a regulation,
that ultimately prohibits
the departure of Jews.
Tell him, the noose is tightened.
And I warn you.
Race betrayal is a crime.
It's dangerous to have a Jewish friend
if you want to achieve something here.
What's going on?
You mean, more dangerous than
having an affair with a German
if you have a wife and daughter?
Do you have the papers?
I need a photograph.
Did you for...
Surprised?
Have you finally
finished my dress?
What for?
You're just going to take it off anyway.
Since when am I accountable to you?
A money-grabbing
hook-nosed Jew.
We're not engaged.
You should be a little more thankful.
"October 7th, 1941."
"The rainy season has begun."
"It's a flood that cripples
and brings everything to a halt."
"The end of the Blitzkrieg."
"As if god averted us for
all the horrors that we bring."
"Maybe it's just the last test."
What?
He says we should stick to the left, and that
we need approximately 12 hours through the swamp.
Left. So there?
Da.
And partisans?
Njet.
I don't trust him.
All right, let's go.
On your feet, ladies.
Dorgerloh, Schneider, Bartel with me.
Winter, you lead the rest.
I want to get out of this damn...
What?
Stay calm, Koch. Stay calm.
Don't move, Koch.
Friedhelm.
Friedhelm, come.
Mines!
Mines!
Retreat, men. Back everyone.
Come, Friedhelm.
Greet... greet my sister.
Come on, now!
And now get lost!
Where is nurse Hildegard?
Hildegard?
Where were you this whole time?
Emptying bedpans.
There's morphine missing again.
If you see anything...
theft is forbidden under penalty of death.
And turn this up.
Probably this whole swamp is mined.
We have to go back and
send the combat engineers in.
Then we'll get stuck here.
My men are already demoralized.
No preparations for the winter
have been made.
If we're not in Moscow in six weeks,
we're going to freeze to death.
Without engineers we lose
at least a third of our men.
It doesn't have to be our men.
Dammit, Winter, that's good.
These damn farmers are all partisans anyway.
This guy sent us in there.
Better them than us.
Move, Move.
Move, you bastard.
Everyone that stops or flees
will be shot.
Do you hear that Ivan?
Do you hear that?
Dawai! Dawai! Dawai!
Marching row. Follow me.
Do you remember our
last evening in Berlin?
Us five.
I was right.
The war will only bring out
the worst of us.
Dawai. Dawai. Dawai.
Move!
You're so quiet. Everything ok?
Bad news?
You lied to me.
You're a doctor.
Yes.
And a Jew.
Yes.
Head nurse.
"...only beats for you."
His name is Hans Müller and he's traveling
to Paris on behalf of the IG Farben.
Written and signed by
the defense inspection 3.
And he should hurry.
From Paris he has to make it
to the unoccupied part.
To Marseille.
After that he's on his own.
Thanks.
If I see him again...
You won't.
"December 1941.
three meters of snow."
"Minus 40 Degrees Celsius."
"Water, that turns to ice
in seconds."
"The assault on Moscow
has failed,
and we are not prepared
for the Winter."
"We have dug into the
rock-hard ground."
"As deep as possible,
like animals in caves,
who are afraid of freezing to death."
"Nothing turned out
the way we imagined."
What do you have here, Winter?
Keep controlling the guards, Bertok.
Are you crazy?
I just wanted to burn it
to warm myself.
We don't even have snow shirts.
Every Russian can see us from a thousand
meters away and shoot us like dogs.
Dogerloh is organizing bed sheets
from the population.
Why are you helping us?
The enemy.
I help people.
You're doing that as well, don't you?
Why don't you tell?
What?
The handsome, young man.
Why don't you tell him?
It's not that easy.
You love him a long time?
Yes.
And always silent? He knows?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Men never know, always only fighting.
And you?
I not hear anything from him
since July.
Maybe you should leave.
Why?
Nothing... It's all right.
Hitler has declared
war on America.
When he starts a war
then properly.
That's going to
break his neck eventually.
We shouldn't have read the
Torah.
but their Bible.
You never read the Torah,
you always wanted to be a Smock.
Lay down.
I'll make you a cup of tea.
Viktor.
You were right.
Your German friend was there.
She brought this.
And she said,
tomorrow at 9.56 AM.
at Bahnhof Friedrichstraße
Merry Christmas.
Say, Charly in the military hospital...
...did she say anything there?
You mean, about you?
Doesn't matter, forget it.
Wilhelm.
She speaks of you the whole time.
Of you only.
Why don't you just tell her?
Hm?
Oh, I understand. You don't
want to give her any hope,
because you don't know if you
come back alive.
Do you still have your photo?
Of course.
Do you remember,
you said, that the war would
be over by Christmas.
And then us five, together in Berlin.
German Christmas carols on the radio.
Lilija, you have to go.
He needs new bandages.
You have to go. Now!
Sister Charlotte has reported,
that a Jew is hiding here.
I'm sorry.
When do you think,
it's going to start again?
I don't know.
Maybe when the snow melts.
Mein Bubele. Mein Bubele.
Mein Bubele.
No. He's sleeping.
It would only break his heart.
You have to go now.
Mein Bubele...
You must only think about yourself, ok?
Do it for me, please.
Go, go now, go.
When I'm in New York,
I'll get you. Yes.
Write...
Write, when you're there.
Viktors Mother cries.
Good Morning, Ladies.
We need someone to carry our food.
I'll do it.
- Good, Winter.
?
Is my brother back yet?
No.
How long is he away now?
More than three hours.
Miss Müller?
Del Torres.
Miss Del Torres,
are you ready?
Greta.
Yes, of course.
I'm ready.
Then, please.
Recording.
"My tiny heart"
