This is an ambitious man.
Earl Haraldson: You accept
that you're a criminal?
Bjorn: Where is father?
Is he dead?
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Torstein: Earl Haraldson has
played a trick on Rollo
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask
for a meeting with the Earl,
challenge him
to a personal combat... With me.
more, give me more
give me more
if I had a heart
I could love you
if I had a voice
I would sing
after the night
when I wake up
I'll see
what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
If I had a voice
I would sing

Svein: What is it?
Housecarl 1: My lord, this man
says he has a message for you
from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant
of Odin.
Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,
then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame
in accepting a challenge
from a criminal.
That would suggest
that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you,
would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.
- Ragnar...
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place
for us.
Ragnar: He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Ragnar: Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
Lagertha: You don't believe
that and neither do I.
Ragnar: You are wrong:
I do believe it.
Siggy:  Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Earl Haraldson: Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys,
what they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man
for whom I have
the utmost respect.
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be...
restless, ambitious.
And he was right about
the Western lands.
But I always knew that
in my heart.
Siggy: Then why
didn't you tell him?
Because the moment
that I reached out
to Ragnar Lothbrok,
was the moment
that all my friends,
all my supporters
would have deserted me
and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true,
our fates have
brought us together.
And maybe he's opened
the Western lands for me.
That is my hope,
after I kill him.
The seer promised
you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
Earl Bjarni: I'm sure
that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them
in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough
as it is.
Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed
to nag her husband
until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you
show a little life
when we have sex, in any case!
Thyri: Very well.
I'll go.
Personal combat
is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people
talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord,
high one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing
as you have done in the past,
if his death pleases you.
I cannot feel your presence...
Husband...?
Our sons hair.
Ragnar: Don't look so worried.
The combatants can choose
any weapon
and shield they desire.
Crowd:
Father, you can do it!
Agghhh!
Agghhh!
Ungh!
Agh!
Agh!
Agh!
Lord odin is here,
waiting to see which one of us
he will take to his great hall.
So I shall...
I shall dine, after all,
at the high table
with the Aesir.
No!
Earl Haraldson: Tonight I shall
be drinking with our boys.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Aghhhh!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Crowd: Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Crowd: Take it! Take it!
Take it!
Leif: Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you
my allegiance
and fealty to you
and your family
from this day.
Ragnar:
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein,
you are my friends.
What is your name?
Old man: Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance
and fealty
to me and to my family
from this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
Tostig:
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask,
lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time
you go raiding,
you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you,
but the truth is you...
Yes, I am old.
Many years I sailed
with lord Haraldson
and fought battles
against the Eastlanders,
And though I fought with them
in the shield-wall,
never once was I touched
by a blade.
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord,
gift me the chance to die
with honor in battle,
and join my friends
in Valhalla.
Ragnar:
This summer, we shall have
more ships to go west,
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
All: Aye.
There is no need for you
to swear.
You have already paid
a heavy price
for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless,
I will swear, brother.
your wife and your family...
As long as
your good fortune holds.
Crowd:
How will we ever be equal now,
my brother?
Why have you agreed
to grant Earl Haraldson
such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man
and a warrior.
He earned his renown
in this life,
and now, in death,
he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
Young woman:
I dreamt a dream last night
of silk as fine fur
now and Earl is felled
by Spears
it is horrible
now to look around
Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died,
all of his slave women
were asked:
"Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
Ragnar: These other
servants are preparing her.
As the valkyries sing
their song
Old woman:
Put the body on the bench.
Siggy:
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
Athelstan:
There's that slave girl...
the one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men
that live in there.
Each one of them says to her:
"Tell your master I did this
out of love for him."
Because she will soon
be reunited
with her master in death,
and she will be able
to speak to him.
Old woman: Silence!
Athelstan:
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the angel of death.
Young slave woman:
I can see my master!
He is in Valhalla.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you,
priest?
I don't want to watch.
Bjorn: It's only death!
You will stay,
or my father will hear of it.
Yeah! Yeah!
Torstein:
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Ragnar!
Tostig: Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar!
Siggy: Move!
I ask permission
to light the pyre.
I have something important
to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy!
The seer told me.
O by all the gods, my son,
you have made me a happy man.
Siggy:
Have you come to kill us?
Rollo: Why would I do that?
Siggy:
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way
that the new Earl
deals with the family
of the old.
Rollo: Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
Rollo: My brother
doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well...
Even if we don't die,
they will still shun us
like a bad smell.
And they'll make it
so we have to leave here,
even though they know
no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you
to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married
to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married
to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me!
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold,
even in here.
I can't wait for the spring,
or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
What?
I said no. But why?
Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient
to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your Uncle,
when he doesn't know
what to say.
Come on.
Athelstan: Ragnar, I have
heard many of your stories,
but tell me...
What is Ragnarok?
I have heard mention of it
several times,
but so far no one has explained
the meaning to me.
Let's show this
ignorant Christian
what Ragnarok is.
Get the leaves.
Ancient seer: The twilight of
the gods will happen like this:
There will be three years
of terrible winters...
And summers of black sunlight.
The wolf, giant Fenrir,
King Aelle: So where did
these Northmen come ashore?
Messenger: They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
and those ships
are now sailing up the tyne.
They have ships
that can cross oceans
but also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up
the tyne,
then, sire,
we shall soon find out.
Ah yes, my lord Wigea,
of course you know
all about them.
You accused them
of having supernatural powers,
which is why a small force
of them defeated you.
Lord Wigea: I merely said
they fought like demons,
like men possessed,
with no fear of death.
Unlike you, my lord?
I fear death
as much as the next man,
but I have no fear
that afterwards
God will raise me up again.
Oh, well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new
to show you.
Let them also bite
those too weak
and afraid to fight
to the death
for their king and master.
My lord! No! No!
You look terrified,
my lord Wigea.
Are you not certain anymore
that God will raise you up
from the grave?
Lord Wigea: Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there
to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
No! Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
Now let us prepare
to defend ourselves
against these heathens
and barbarians.
