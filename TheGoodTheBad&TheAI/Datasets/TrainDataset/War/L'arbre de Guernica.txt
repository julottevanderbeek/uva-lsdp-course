THE GUERNICA TREE
Are you going to the Carnival?
Everybody is at the fair.
Everybody is at the Carnival.
Everything goes.
There are no rules.
You might meet somebody
so you won't have to sleep alone.
We are free now.
- Still single at her age.
- All alone in the mountains.
She doesn't see anybody
except for her donkey.
our castle was a well-respected,
sacred place before the Republic.
Look at it now, surrounded,
threatened by that filth.
To think that for all these years,
all these centuries,
our family ruled Villa Ramiro
and its surroundings.
And now our authority
has been abused and defeated,
so defeated that we have to live
Iike exiled people.
I have to release the dogs
into the courtyard of our property
to deter the excesses
of the most vindictive and excited
of all that riff-raff.
The residents of Villa Ramiro
used to be so disciplined.
Look at them now,
marching down the streets
to bury a sardine in the middle
of an orgy in some degrading carnival.
They're trying to prove
that contrary to the orders
of our blessed mother, the church,
they would actually eat meat
instead of fish during Lent.
The Republic is to blame
for all of that and so is democracy.
This nation that up until yesterday
was subjected
to the righteous authority
of the aristocrats
is now dreaming
of launching a revolution.
It is corrupted
by demagogy and liberty.
When freedom came,
it also restored
Villa Ramiro's faith in the future.
She blossomed, free at last.
I think that pretty soon
there won't be any discrimination
against races,
politics or religions.
When that day arrives,
dwarves will be men like all the others.
Never lose your serenity,
that's the source of all your strength.
Never lose your zest for life.
We are just passing,
but life isn't.
Nowadays,
evil has no sense of humor.
When I think about the future,
I feel light and I can fly.
There is hope in my heart.
I could only believe in a God
who knew how to dance.
one must be perfect,
like animals are
and that requires innocence.
In fact, we only love our childhood
and its masterpiece.
Violence against fascists
isn't an answer, but an end in itself.
They love war
for the sake of it.
They're unhappy.
They only dream about death.
Unlike them,
I only live for a better world.
Adriano, what I like about you
are all my hopes.
How long are you going to keep on
living devoid of common sense,
this Bohemian lifestyle
that will destroy you?
Furthermore,
your three cousins
just showed their evil streak
by attempting to rape
an eccentric woman.
You must come back
to manage everything.
You are my only son.
Starting today,
you must take over the succession.
We are approaching
times of crisis,
times of chaos,
an era that the bad shepherds
call Revolution.
The scum of Villa Ramiro,
just like the scum
of the rest of the country
is ready to destroy everything.
There are lots of talks about giving
the land to those who cultivate it
and to take it away from us,
the owners.
You must come back
to save the land
and manage everything over here,
before I die.
You cannot refuse.
At your age, how can one imagine
that a 40 year old man,
a mature man,
a bright man like you
could keep on living
such a stupid, mediocre life?
Rumors of your exploits
with your surrealist friends
reached us all the way here.
I know that you soiled
the coat of arms of the country,
that you traumatized poor little girls at
their first communion,...
Dear brothers,
your attention, please.
We just received a message
from the Red Cross.
All these communion wafers
are poisoned.
...that you provoked the members
of the Spanish Royal Academy...
Don Marcelino Menendez Y Pelayo,
father of the Spanish Critic,
- notable forerunner of--
- Academicians to the mental hospital!
...that you made a revolting
and sacrilegeous painting.
You and your friends
are a bunch of hoodlums.
People I consider to be
the scum of society.
Here is what you gave me yesterday
and what I'm giving back to you today.
Now we are even.
What do you mean?
What's in this glass?
A few drops of my sperm.
The lnsurrection against the Republic has
been meticulously planned.
The conspirators are ready for action
and will do so when the time is right.
our men were recruited
all over the Spanish territory.
The richest personalities
of the country such as March,
have decided just like Hitler
and Mussolini
to provide us with all the assistance
we might need.
In Barcelona,
General Goded will rise
and take over Catalonia
and Las Ramblas
A Seuta, le Colonel Yague
with a motorized division
and several African troops
will spring into action.
At Las Palmas, General Franco,
in connection with the aerial base
will take over the operations.
In Pamplona, General Mola
and the Carlists will occupy Navarre.
In Melia, le colonel Segue will rise with
Third Regiment of lnfantry.
And here, at the Villa Ramiro,
we will take over with the Falange.
It won't be easy.
The town is infested with Republicans
who seduced the masses
with their demagogy.
Revolutionaries
should be exterminated right away
and the strategic areas
of the city taken over.
These two actions should be
carried out simultaneously.
The Army will be on time
on the 18th at 5:00 A.M..
Either we'll triumph in an hour,
or, if our plans fail,
we will have to face a long civil war.
Villa Ramiro will be a reflection
of what could happen
in all of Spain.
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
How long will the people
accept to live
under the powerful ones?
Yes, long live freedom!
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!
What's going on?
What do you want?
Cousin, you must join us.
Go on, Rafael.
on the 18th we will all rise.
Then I will go to bed.
Don't you see
what I'm trying to tell you?
on the 18th, we will all rise
against the Republic.
We are going to have
a coup d'état.
Everything has been planned.
The Army is on our side.
I'm pleased to see
you still have balls.
Vipers bites won't stop you
from brandishing your gun
to defend your ideal.
I forbid you to laugh
when you talk about our ideal.
There are many heroes
among the conspirators.
What do I care
about your schemes?
I don't give a damn
about your political stories.
It makes me laugh.
The only heroes left
when we'll organize ourselves in Spain,
will be the deserters.
Good luck.
They are getting ready
to wipe us out.
They are conspiring against us,
we already know that.
But people
will be opposed to it.
Don't repeat this to anyone--
"our Father who art in heaven,
give us this day our daily bread..."
Because the collectivist society
of tomorrow
after having eliminated the ruling classes
will give us all our daily bread
as well as truffled foie gras
every day.
I dread what's going to happen.
I'm afraid it's gonna be
another barbaric period.
Freedom is essential
but ever so hard.
And many only feel a need
to consume.
Unfortunately,
that often means
the elimination of others.
our current civilization
is going to perish.
And either we are at the dawn
of a new barbaric era,
or something really horrible.
Neither the sun, nor death,
can face each other.
We are all walking
on a tightrope,
on the tiniest tightrope.
All it would take would be
to lean over a bit too far
to plummet into illusions
or despair.
Fascism means death.
The man of the party
must become a liar.
Martyrs always bury the truth.
Pacifism cannot be a capitulation,
but rather a type of resistance.
You are such an idealist, come with us to
the demonstration, come on.
No, I have to go to school
with my pupils.
I've been elected by all of you,
to represent Republican order
and equality.
I'm asking you,
residents of Villa Ramiro,
to obey the law
even though you know
they're conspiring against us.
You are asking me for weapons,
but only the army can carry them.
Give us weapons!
Calm down,
I'm begging you, calm down.
We will all rise tomorrow
at dawn in 10 hours.
With General Goded in Madrid,
General Queipo de Llano in Seville,
and Las Recades in the North.
The Republic will be destroyed
before it even knew what hit it
and the whole country
will be in our hands
from the Portuguese
to the French border.
Everything has been planned
around here.
We all know the time and date
and the role we have to play.
This is a list
of all the arrests to be made.
And this is a list
of hasty executions
that are necessary
to terrorize the population.
If necessary we will exterminate
half of the village.
Long live Christ our King!
Long live Christ our King!
Radio Paris here.
It's hard to come across
as impartial and fair
when it comes
to the devastating tragedy
our southern neighbors
are currently going through
The Spanish Civil War
has just begun.
Following the first confrontations
and the confusion that followed,
Spain is divided in two.
Geographically it is divided
by a line that goes through Madrid.
To the east is the Republican
popular front
who is confident
that this budding war
will only be
an unexpected shortcut
that will lead them to a world
of justice, equality and tolerance.
To the west, the military, the clergy
and the main landowners
are adamant
about restoring an order
similar to the one established
by the inquisition in its days.
After having uncovered
a fascist plot,
Villa Ramiro is in the hands
if its inhabitants
who have decided to take over
the Count's Castle,
symbol of the tyranny
that enslaved them for centuries.
Mr. the Count--
I mean, Comrade Count.
Whoever isn't on our side
is against us.
open the gate of your castle
and come stand in front of us all.
Come outside
with your servants and your family.
Come outside with your hands up,
come outside.
Vamos.
Vamos.
Fascist
Exploiter Capitalist Fascist."
It's a rather symbolic
demonstration...
What a surprise!
Good morning.
it's the first time Count Cerralbo visits the
public school.
Have a seat, please.
Sir, I came to bring you this gift.
- What's the occasion?
- Because of all those rascals.
You mean,
the residents of Villa Ramiro?
For centuries,
you and your family
have treated those people
Iike in the days of slavery,
by denying them their daily bread,
asking them to cut short their life,
gagged so they wouldn't
eat the grape,
dressing them in used burlap,
forcing them to sell their most beautiful
daughters to prostitution,
Count of Cerralbo,
I'm against all forms of bribing.
Trust me, an outburst
like the one that occurred this morning
was molded by your own hands
for centuries.
I didn't come here to talk politics.
I came here
to ask you to hide me.
My life is threatened.
A fanatic could shoot me
at anytime.
I beg of you, hide me,
in the name of Christian charity.
I could only do that
as a humane gesture.
Anyway, our side,
I mean, the Falangist side--
Right, your accomplice.
When they'll get here,
they will take in consideration
the fact that you protected me.
Think about it.
of course and I won't be killed
in the arena
Iike my predecessor,
Mr. Nora.
without a fair trial.
I can assure you
nobody will harm you,
you have my word on it.
I'm going to hide you because
it's the humane thing to do, as I said.
But you're wrong to try
to convince me with such low tactics.
Keep your money.
As far as this jewel is concerned,
I'm not used
to wearing gold bracelets.
The Republican government
who is nothing more
than the bastard offspring
born of the liberals' mingling
with the socialists
is about to collapse
thanks to the upheaval
of the Spanish Army
that has the support
of the clergy and the ruling class.
Spain, the real Spain,
is about to slaughter
the Marxist dragon,
who's hit the dust
and is now crawling.
Spain is safe!
Villa Ramiro is already
between our hands.
From the Spanish Republic Radio
out of the Madrid Studio.
People of Spain,
stay tuned,
don't turn off your radio.
Traitors against the nation
are spreading rumors
regarding some obscure
criminal plot
organized by a reactionary
and fascist minority.
People are showing up
everywhere to help the Republic
that a small group of fascists
is trying to overturn by force.
our legitimate republic
will know how to resist
this minority of military renegades
kept afloat
by fascism and nazism
to avoid a civil war.
We are adamant about denouncing
an erroneous information--
Villa Ramiro is still Republican.
How come Villa Ramiro
is still standing?
The Spanish Civil War is still going on with
its pro-Franco procession.
At Suda de Rodrigo,
a peasant accused
of having disrespected
an object of worship
was cruelly tortured in public
then put to death.
Attention!
Get ready.
Squadron ready to execute the lawyer
Delbosque, traitor against the country.
Get set...
fire!
FRANCE
In Guernica, under this tree,
the Spanish monarch
and its deputies
swore as was the custom
to respect the specific rights
of its inhabitants.
This is the Freedom Tree.
The Guernica Tree.
...Culture
According to tradition,
the town's children
are going to participate
in the "most beautiful tree
in Guernica" contest.
But don't forget,
blood calls for more blood,
torture calls for more torture.
The chain reaction unlatched
by some fascist minority
is covering our land
with so much mourning.
The lowest instincts of man
spring up and blind his lucidity.
We will fight
for justice and freedom.
We'll keep on fighting
because we gave our all
for the Republic to succeed.
Aristocrats' houses
have been converted into schools.
Charitable organizations gave back
pawned objects for free.
Chalices and convents' fences
have been melted to cast
ammunitions to defend people.
And today, although fights and war
are setting the whole country ablaze,
we are going to ask the orchestra
to play for us all,
"Let's rejoice, victory is near."
What is your name?
Tell me yours first.
"Fascism assassinates culture"
In spite of the atrocities,
Iife is returning to normal
in the small town of Villa Ramiro.
Although we are besieged
since the bombing
of the city of Guernica.
But we are still holding our own
against the fascist army.
Right in the middle of battles
classes are being offered
to the combatants
so there won't be ignorant
among them.
In the hope that the best medicine
against terror and intolerance
will be culture.
Contrary to the saying,
one shouldn't
"love thy neighbor as thyself,"
but love thyself as thy neighbor.
Because if we don't love thyself,
we don't love thy neighbor.
The worst enemy you can encounter
will always be yourself.
And now we're going to re-enact
the savage bombing of Guernica.
The town of Guernica
was razed by the Nazi air force
and the Guernica Tree,
"the Freedom Tree"
miraculously survived
the slaughtering.
It remained untouched like hope.
Villa Ramiro outnumbered
by troops surrounding it,
doesn't seem to accept defeat.
According to experts, it doesn't look like
the city can resist any longer
with hunting riffles and stones
against a modern army.
"Free people of the world
are with Villa Ramiro."
"Long live democracy!"
Where can I sign up for battle?
These are the Third Battalion
barracks, comrade.
- Halt.
- I am Vandale.
- Where are you headed?
- Home, to Villa Ramiro.
- Are you a Commie?
- Let her be.
She's a poor woman
who's got nothing to do with this.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. Bring her to me.
We'll meet again, with no vipers
and no soldiers around,
just the two of us.
- Then--
- Halt!
I'm not one to hold a grudge.
Don't go to Villa Ramiro.
We've surrounded the city
and in two days,
cannons will be brought in
in order to eradicate
the last of the rebels.
If you don't take this seriously,
you'll surely die.
Villa Ramiro will fall
any time soon.
It would be ridiculous
to redirect our troops
and try to protect a city that's been
almost completely surrounded
and whose only means
of protection are its walls!
Villa Ramiro is a symbol for us
and we have to defend it
with all we have--
our teeth, our nails,
our guts and blood--
and if that's not enough,
we'll bury those killers
in our own shit!
Goya, you're talking like a poet,
not like a rebel.
I'm just a common soldier
fighting for freedom.
Fighting? How?
By sending the Fifth Company,
the Third Regiment, the Third Column?
They have to know that we are
with them every step of the way,
that they've not been forgotten.
They have to know
that Spain is fighting for them.
Telephone communication with them
has been cut off!
I'll fly there.
You very well know
we have no planes available.
Don't you worry about that.
I've commandeered one.
The Marquis of Quijo
had a personal plane.
But the sky is permanently infested
with German planes!
Listen, children.
The thought for the day is:
"ldeas that arrive
on the wings of a dove
Iead the world."
You can go
to the demonstration now.
Yeah!
Comrade Vandale who has just
arrived from Guernica,
the city razed to the ground,
wants to speak to you!
Listen, all of you
living in Villa Ramiro!
It's better to die standing tall
than to live on our knees.
The fascists--
the fascists who have
destroyed Guernica
will never destroy
the Tree of Liberty!
They want to take over Villa Ramiro
but Villa Ramiro will
bury the fascism
and despotism
of the privileged!
Men, women...
comrades, let us bear arms!
If you don't have a weapon,
steal it from a dead enemy.
If you have nothing,
fight with your bare hands,
throw boiling oil
on the enemies of the people!
And let the children help
build barricades!
Those who do not have faith in our victory
are nothing but cowards!
Those men...
those men who savagely
crushed Guernica and its inhabitants
in a deluge of iron and fire
will not be allowed to rule
Villa Ramiro or Spain!
Let every place,
every house be a fortress!
Let every neighborhood be
an iron barrier against our attackers!
Citizens of Villa Ramiro,
rise up in arms!
The world is looking at you!
¡No pasarán!
They shall not pass!
Comrades, here's
a message for you!
"Spain is with Villa Ramiro!"
"Villa Ramiro is
the symbol of democracy!"
"Heroic people
of Villa Ramiro, resist!"
"Villa Ramiro is
the banner of the Republic!"
Get back there.
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Republic.
They shall not pass.
People of Villa Ramiro,
you all know me.
I am Rafael Cerralbo!
Rafael Cerralbo,
I am Vandale!
There is no point
in putting up a fight.
You have been besieged
by forces incalculably superior to yours.
We are waiting for you!
And this time, we have more
than vipers to defend ourselves.
There they are!
Shoot towards the cannons!
General, we have
been overwhelmed.
- That can't be!
- It is.
our weapons have
been destroyed.
Villa Ramiro must fall!
It is the heart of the Republic!
our troops can't raid the city.
The locals are fighting
like wild animals.
But our force is superior!
It's easier to stay behind
city walls than attack them.
So we'll send
the German Condor Legion.
- All right.
- And two of Mussolini's divisions.
- All right.
- We have to wipe out Villa Ramiro!
Yes, sir!
Fascist troops have decided to put
an end to Villa Ramiro's resistance.
The largest concentration of troops
since the beginning of the war
has begun its siege of Villa Ramiro.
Franco's army has
been strengthened
by massive numbers
of German and ltalian volunteers.
Battle is taking place
on such unequal footing
that the city will fall in no time.
Let me go!
Let's kill him now!
Here's Vandale,
our speech fanatic!
Whore!
Be careful, she bit a priest
and almost ripped his arm off!
Rafael Cerralbo
will be very pleased.
Turn west!
Turn east!
We, soldiers who have
fought for our country,
cannot waste our time on so-called
democratic justice measures,
mere criminal methods
used to sabotage
what is just punishment.
However, you have
been given the chance
to stand trial in accordance
with military code.
Which means that
there will be no witnesses,
the defendants will not be
at liberty to address the court
and sentences will be carried out
without possible appeal
tomorrow morning.
The first defendant is
Antonio Garcia, school teacher,
charged with the murder
of Count Cerralbo.
The evidence I've been
handed is damning.
Moreover, a jacket belonging
to the count was found at the school.
This is a tragic
misunderstanding.
Quiet!
You have no right to speak!
Your lawyer, Captain Ares,
can speak in your name.
- I've never met him.
- I said be quiet
or I'll blow your head off
with this very gun
that defended our motherland!
Captain Ares,
as the defendant's attorney,
what do you have to say
in his name?
The unforgivable crime
committed by the defendant
calls for the full rigor of the law,
but I will ask the court
to show clemency.
Upon hearing the defense
and reviewing the evidence,
we hereby sentence
Antonio Garcia to death.
Let's move on
to the next defendant,
Angel Castillo, blacksmith,
charged with several crimes
committed during the Communist
upheaval in Villa Ramiro.
I am Count Cerralbo.
- Sir, you have--
- How do you dare
interrupt the judicial process?
Villa Ramiro's school teacher has
just been sentenced to death
for killing Count Cerralbo,
which is outrageous
- considering I am Count Cerralbo.
- How is that possible?
I haven't killed anybody.
Indeed, I am Count Cerralbo.
Not only is this man
not guilty of murder,
he hid and protected me.
Since he was well-respected
in Villa Ramiro during the upheaval,
I was safe from the Communists.
Very well.
You are dismissed.
We will change the sentence.
Guard, please escort
Count Cerralbo out of the courtroom.
We revoke the death sentence
pronounced upon Antonio
Garcia for murder,
but considering
Count Cerralbo's allegation
that the defendant
had such a good reputation
among the Communists,
to the point of being able
to hide one of our men,
we sentence him to death,
not by gunshot but by garrote.
The list of prisoners
to be executed.
- Everything ready?
- Everything.
- You have the muzzles?
- Here.
I don't want to hear
anything subversive
Iike "long live the Republic"
or "freedom will prevail,"
or see any kind
of unruly behavior.
They won't say a word
with that on.
Sir, this one was
used yesterday.
It is still dripping with
the Commie's slobber.
Rafael...
we have arrested Vandale.
Wonderful.
Make sure those brutes
go to confession before they die.
They are quite stubborn.
Yesterday, a priest had
to kill one with his crucifix.
He was uttering
horrific blasphemy.
Go get the condemned
and prepare for the execution.
As for me...
I intend to celebrate
Vandale's arrival...
with her, of course.
Go on.
Here are the names of those
to be executed in the morning:
Juan Pérez Gonzales;
Antonio Gómez;
Moises Pérez Pérez;
Melquisedes Arivas Gómez;
ojelio Verzoza Campillio;
Anacleto Torrez Pereira;
Angel Castillo Fuente;
Miguel Angel Lopez Terán;
Vicente Posuedo Escudero;
Vicente Gonzalez Ruis;
Jesús Raul Camunior;
Luis Pescador de Arroyo.
Pacifism must not be
a mere form of resignation,
but an active act of resistance,
a call to life.
"ldeas that arrive on the wings
of a dove lead the world."
This is a public announcement!
By decree of local
military authorities,
all commandeered land will be
given back to its owner;
the local school is closed
and will be used as a prison;
Sunday Mass attendance
is compulsory;
military courts will replace
civil courts;
religious authorities
have informed us
that His Holiness the Pope
has declared our fight
against the Republic
a Crusade.
Executions will take place publicly
every day at the cemetery.
A celebration will take place
tomorrow in the arena
to celebrate our victory
in Villa Ramiro.
Par ici.
Let's go, toro.
Come.
Par ici.
Para usted, mi general.
I have plenty of time.
Eventually, you'll tell me
everything you know
about the Republican
headquarters.
I am ready
to tell you everything I know.
I'm listening.
Come closer.
Closer.
Can you hear that?
There's a round every night.
Soon, you'll beg me
to get you executed,
but I won't.
Not until you have endured
all the forms of torture I know.
Did you hear that?
You deserve the same fate.
This prison is not
very comfortable.
You are mine now.
I can do with you whatever I want.
Come here. Let me free you
from your shackles.
Attention, please!
We are interrupting our program
to read the latest statement
coming straight from
General Franco's headquarters.
"Citizens, our army has
defeated the enemy
and we have reached our goals.
The war is over."
My name is...
Goya.
I am Vandale.
Vandale.
We can't give up.
our people must be free again.
The Tree of Guernica,
covered in ashes,
still stands, like our hope.
