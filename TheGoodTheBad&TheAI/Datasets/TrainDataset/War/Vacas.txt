Guess who's coming?
- He's ZaIdibia.
One of Goizueta's woodsmen.
CarmeIo of MendiIuze.
He's a... seargeant.
If you give me a head start,

You've stopped shaking.
Now, shoot.
Shoot, damn it!

-No. We aren't in the picture.
Watch. Now he's doing my ear.
This one.
He's doing Txagorri's ear.
- How d'you know?
Grandpa, we're in the picture?
Of course.
- You see?
A cow onIy stays put if heId.
EspeciaIIy in a picture.
That Iooks Iike Txargorri.

mushroom and go mad.
Beware of the boars!
II - THE AXES
Bet 700. They'II have a job
raising it, but wiII accept.
You'II bet...with us?
Everybody knows the feud's

It's easy money.
You know that feIIow aIways
quits first.
AIright, done.
We'II bet on brother?
They're here.

HaIf the money.
He's strong, but you're quicker.
Like your Pa.
He's Iooking at her.
Done.
We'II raise our haIf somehow.
They've accepted.
I wrote it down.
Good Iuck.
- OK.
What do you think?
You make different noises.
Different noises?
-Yes, different.
Your brother and Ignacio
IrigibeI are different.
Are you?
I can outIast him anytime.
He tires easiIy.
- True.
But he couId finish first.
ReIax. We'II win .
Lucas!
Come on !
Next month , the winner wiII meet
SozaIuze.
He'II be among champions.
The test is to cut...
...ten trunks first.
The match is private,

You're Iike your Pa. It's in your bIood.
BIood?
Fix another match.
The judge said he'II meet
SozaIuze next.
I can't change it!
What a waste!
What a disaster!
But, Grandpa, we won
That's true. I wrote it down.
Thank God the scythe's not on.
It wouId have cut our feet.
Four feet.
Not bad.
HoId it.
HoId on!
HoId stiII.
CarefuI! It's very dangerous!
Now, jump!
He's back with a huge cow!
A cow and a horse!
He must have beaten SozaIuze!
I don't hear the axe.
- He hasn't seen him.
Is that odd cow ours?
Yes. Your father wiII be as
famous as Grandpa.
BIack spots. Why?
She's fuII of miIk.
The spots are reaIIy white.
You won again?
- Sure. Want a ride?
Later.

I want to see the cow.
- See it from the horse.
HoId me, eh?
- Sure. Upsadaisy!
She's huge.
What's her name?

What is it?
- PupiIIe.
Why's she bIack?

BIack with white spots.
- BIack ones. Maybe she's pregnant.
She's Dutch. Imported.
Very expensive.
How much?
- A Iot.
He stiII wants to chaIIenge you.
How about another match?
Your eyes are mute.
IgueIdo's stud mounted her.
It's some beast.
What's a stud?
- A huge buII.
You Iook pregnant.
Let's see what's in there.
If you gaze on that
oId coward's son...
...you'II ruin Juan's Iife.
Your father'II turn in his grave
and you'II be the death of me.
He won't fight Juan. Not ever.
Why not? Who toId you so?
Nobody.
I toId myseIf.
What have you done to me?
What have you cut off me?
III - THE LIGHTED PIT
Ten Years After.
Spring, 1915.
Good morning.
Come to the shade.
What's with you?
I must taIk to you.
Juan, there's no shade here.
Hush, Peru.
- But it's true!
I don't Iike you to go out aIone.
You've no husband, CataIina.
You, Peru, no father.
Since mother died you've onIy me.
You aren't Iistening.
-Yes.
What'd I say?
Don't stare at me!
When I get nervous
I don't mean to frighten you!
I can't heIp it!
But you can!
I don't want to hurt you!
Let him go!
A boar!
There aren't any around here.
There were when I was young.
Once I wounded a femaIe.
I dragged her to the pit,
cast her in.
She squeaIed for two days.
The pit was Iit aII summer.
ShaII we Iight it?
Here, give me.
- No, Iet me.
Throw it higher!
To the Ieft.
That's it. It's Iit.
Listen.
You've won again.
PIease stand on that trunk.
We'II take some photos.
Another camera here.
Lift it up high as if...
...you were about to chop wood.
Let the worId know
who's the ace.
Great. Now rest it
on your shouIder.
Gaze on the horizon.
Lift the axe high.
IIegorri, pose next to
IrigibeI II.
That's it, a photo together.
Hey, Iisten !
I taught him aII he knows,
so Iet me have a Iook.
It's Lucas. IIegorri's son.
He's come to gawp at my tits.
What ambition does the
champion have for the future?
How does it feeI to return...
...crowned with IaureIs?
You saw your son?
My father. He never
taught me anything.
You're IrigibeI I?
ManueI IrigibeI, the best
aizcoIari of aII time.
And a CarIist war hero.
-It's in the bIood.
Speaking of bIood...
-...has anyone seen my grandson?
- Let him be!
See that camera?
Take it without anyone seeing you.
Hide it.
SteaI it?
OnIy if it's for both of us.
The three of us.
- Agreed.
My brother's mad.
Peru and I are scared of him.
Let's go away as soon as we can.
Very far away.
- Europe's at war.
America, then.
We must take Peru.
Let me sIeep with you.
Stop it or we'II Ieave!
We'II go away!
Where to?
With Ignacio! That's it!
You'II run off with him.
CaIm down! I won't kiII you.
Listen!
I won't kiII you!
I'm your brother!
Your brother!
Your brother!
I don't want to kiII you.
Nor to hurt you.
I'm your brother.
I'm here, my son.
CaIm down!
Nothing's the matter.
Ask Ignacio for money
for the boy's support...
...and we three can go abroad.
Europe's at war.
America, then.
MadaIen!
Stand near the cow.
Near PupiIIe.
Do as he says.
Who'II take the photo?
The camera itseIf. Won't it?
This is important.
This is very important.
Watch cIoseIy.
So important.
This is most important.
It's carrying off
a snakeskin.
Yes, most important.
Never forget.
What's wrong with PupiIIe?
She Iooks tired and
her miIk stinks.
She shouId go graze
at the pit.
Cristina.
Your task is to miIk PupiIIe
because her miIk's infected.
Eat this, my pretty.
It'II do you good.
Disgusting !
It stinks!
Phew!
What's on the other side...
...of the hoIe?
- Same as here, more or Iess.
You're on the other side.
We're here.
No, I'm the onIy one here.
PupiIIe wiII soon be with me.
That's PupiIIe.
She'II die any day now.
The earth eats, digests.
She's got no hoofs.
He sure Iooks at you.
He may, if he Iikes.
You too.
Find some poisonous mushrooms.
We must ease PupiIIe's pain.
And beware of the boars!
When did they grow?
- SuddenIy.
They've miIk?
May I see them?
I've had it! You oId fooI.
You egoist.
You shouId have died in the war.
Coward!
Everyone knows you're a coward.
I can take anymore!
- Don't do that!
He's insane!
She was dying. We poisoned
her to ease the pain.
Then why did she cry out?
Shouts heIp one die.
It's proper to shout.
Where's my mother?
I don't know. I haven't seen her.
Grandpa...
...are you hurt because
I caIIed you crazy?
No, not at aII.
Forgive me.
But I don't mind .
You knew. I toId you. Remember?
I'm here on the other side.
Where's mother?
What are you staring at? Not here.
She isn't here.
Your father's car...
...came and went.
Understood?
They've abandoned us.
Liar! You kiIIed her!
Juan kiIIed my mother!
Let me go! No! No!
Come see your mother, Peru !
Let me go!
Look! Can you see her?
She's waiting for you to join her!
Look! It's her!
There she is!
My mother's in the pit!
Juan has kiIIed her!
That's PupiIIe. Her fIesh was
infected and must be burned.
Have you seen my mother?
She's sent for me?
She's waiting for you.
Cristina, I'II write to you!
Write to me!
Cristina! Write to me!
Dear Cristina...
I'm going to schooI here in
America.
I'm Iearning how to write...
...but father is stiII writing
this Ietter for me.
The photograph I've encIosed
is of our house.
And that is our car.
Dear Peru...
...I don't know how
to write either.
The crooked handwriting is
Grandpa's, the words mine.
There are more of us than
when you Ieft.
But we're doing weII.
At Ieast father
Ieft us the cows.
I wish I couId send a
picture Grandpa did of you.
I've quit studying.
I'm working as a photographer
in a newspaper.
I took the pictures I sent
you myseIf.
At Iast I've seen a boar.
We didn't trap it.
It wasn't IikeIy we wouId.
I saw it in another forest.
They say Iiving aIone suits
your uncIe.
AII I know...is that he's grown
a beard.
The readhead in the picture
is my wife.
We were married Iast month.
She's reaIIy sIimmer...
...but she's about
to have our baby.
I Iaughed a Iot when I saw
your wife.
My boyfriend was a redhead.
I'm gIad we broke off.
He was Lucas. IIegorri's son.
As you can see...this postcards's
from EngIand.
I'm here to take photos
for my paper.
EngIand is cIose to home and
makes me remember it.
Grandpa onIy paints
cows that bIeed.
He wants to Iive in the forest.
He's very oId.
He may want to die.
We send our Iove.
The war has began.
But nobody's come
around here.
I want to Ieave.

Shit! What's going on here?
Where are they?
Where are you, bastards?
Son of a bitch!
Come out here, bastard!
What a mess!

We're together now.
Who's there?

Get a move on!
Traitor! You're a traitor!

Anyone want a photo?
A photo? Anyone want a photo?

As a mess boy.
How are you?
Fine. OnIy a IittIe hungry.

A Iot better.

But you have it on you.
So I do. What a fright.

So did I.
Is France at war?

How nice!
There's food in here.
I'm so hungry.
Peru.
- What?
Hug me tighter.
Now whisper in my ear.
I Iove you more

I've waited for you

That's important.

We're nearIy there.
To LoIa.
