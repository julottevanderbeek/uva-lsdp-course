July 31st, 1985
Japan's War Graves Commission
announced the discovery
of the Yamato's resting place.
In August, 1999
a shooting crew visited Yamato again
at latitude N 30.43/ longitude E 128.04,
lying 325m below the surface.
The birth of Yamato means
the largest warship power owned by Japan.
Symbol of the lmperial Navy,
she stood as tall as
an 18-story building.
"Maritime Self-Defense Supply Ship"
"returning from duty in Indian Ocean."
"April 6th, 2005"
Atsushi.
Washing that tub
won't make her go faster.
He's right. Tell old man, Kamio.
We're off.
"Makurazaki Fisherman's Cooperative"
I'd like to see the harbor master.
He's with a visitor.
Tomorrow's the 60th memorial
of the Yamato's sinking.
I was asked to get you to come for once.
I said Kamio's never been
even to one ceremony.
But how about it this year?
Sorry to be a trouble.
I didn't mean it like that.
How's the boy shaping up?
He's working hard.
Someone wants a boat.
To where?
Latitude N 30.43, longitude E 128.04.
That's the Yamato...
I'm ready to pay.
I just really need to go.
I'm not the harbor master.
I beg your pardon.
Please, introduce someone
who'll take me.
Forget it. It's 200 kilometers.
Damn rough out there, too.
It's no place for a landlubber.
I'm done, Skipper.
Look, Atsushi...
Waited long?
No
Excuse me.
Will someone take me
to latitude N 30
That's impossible.
Won't someone go with me?
Forget it.
But I've got to get there.
"In Memoriam: Moriwaki, Shohachi"
"Died April 7th, 1945"
So...
Why do you want to go out there?
Well...
It's where the Yamato sank.
On April 7th, 60 years ago.
Tomorrow's the anniversary.
I really wanna go
I come this far,
only to realize it's impossible.
What's your name?
It's Uchida.
My father was Mamoru Uchida.
Petty Officer Uchida?
You knew my father?
But he went down with the ship.
He passed away last year.
He survived...
I had no idea.
He spoke of the Yamato before he died.
Told me about the true comrades
he made aboard.
I was selfish...
gave him nothing but grief...
Never tried to get a sense of his life.
Now he's gone...
I want to know all about him.
I must've been an ungrateful child.
It'll take 15 hours.
The sea will be rough.
If you still want to go.
Will you take me?
I couldn't find Atsushi.
Turns out he's put to sea
with that woman.
In that old boat?
Kamio-san, my father mentioned you.
Do you know these men?
This was among his things.
Says it was taken in 1943 in Kure.
Moriwaki-san, Uchida-san
& Karaki-san...
"March, 1942"
Mom, I'm back Katsumi Kamio - age 15
You twos are back
I'm back
Mom, no-one uses the boat,
so why clean it every day?
If your brother returns from the war
and it's not ready,
I'll be in big trouble.
Aunty, did Kamio really volunteer
for the Navy?
My brother signed up.
I can't let him outdo me.
But 15 year-old kids
shouldn't go to war.
Right, Aunty?
Don't worry
America is a place believe in indicidualism
The papers say the Yanks are
too individualistic to fight for long.
We better hope they're right.
Mom, stop worrying!
Drop by later, Taeko.
Cadet Seaman, Kamio, Katsumi.
Reporting for duty!
You don't look so tough to me.
Skipper, you went to war at 15?
How old are you, Atsushi?
Well, you're already working hard.
Saving to buy a motor-bike.
Skip', says I'll get extra
for this trip.
Go open the engine hatch.
Sorry you've extra expense
for my sake.
Don't worry. It's not for your sake.
June, 1941. In protest at Japan's
invasion of China,
Britain, the US and Holland
impose sanctions and an oil embargo.
To avoid suck risk of economic loss,
Japan breaks the impasse on December 8th,
Japan launched the attack
on Pearl Harbor.
On that same day, Yamato
began her sea trials.
Hongkong, Malaysia, Singapore, Phillipine
and even Indonesia
"June, 1942"
However, Japan suffers a major defeat
at Midway.
By the US army.
The tides of battle turns
"August, 1942"
American forces land on Guadalcanal.
After 6 months of bitter fighting,
Japan withdraws.
Commander of the Combined Fleet
Isoroku Yamamoto,
April, 18th, in combat
met with US planes over the Pacific
with a worthy death.
Promoted to the Supreme
Military Council,
as Fleet Admiral on June 5th.
He was buried with full honors
"Spring, 1944 - Kure Harbor"
As the military situation deteriorated
cadet training was speeded up.
And they were quickly
shipped off to battle.
Many were boys barely 16 years old.
It's the Yamato.
Biggest warship in the world.
Incredible
A floating mountain.
And we're going aboard.
You're slow! Hurry up!
When the ensign's aloft,
salute only officers.
Do not salute enlisted ranks.
Salute!
At ease.
Seaman Date...
and 64 cadets
Today, April 13th, 1944,
ordered to the Yamato,
reporting for duty aboard, sir!
Salute!
Stand by for assignments.
Signal Corps: Seaman Date...
Seaman Satake...
On the double!
Anti-Aircraft Defense: Seaman Kamio...
Seaman Mizutani...
Seaman Kitamura...

Seaman Nishi...
Seaman Nakai...
Seaman Fuse...
On the double.
The Major Cook:
Seaman Sumio
Seaman Kozawa
Every afternoon you will do
one hour of judo, kendo or sumo.
Ippon...
Scored
PO Uchida.
Petty Officer Uchida.
I'm not done.
Scored! PO Moriwaki.
Petty Officer Moriwaki.
I'm not done. One more!
Come on, then.
Attention! Follow your officer
Squad leaders, all hands
to duty stations.
This is your battle station.
Do not forget it.
Don't look down! Hurry up!
The new recruits are here.
Cadet Kojima.
Cadet Tsukaguchi.
Squad of 9, please.
Squad of 11, please.
Squad of 15, please.
Moriwaki, sir. New arrivals.
Seaman, Tokita, sir.
Ozawa, sir.
Ever cooked rice?
Only once at school.
Spend today watching the others.
We cook for all 2,500 men right here.
Keep your wits about you.
Tradition says that here in the boiler,
our fate is to go down with the ship.
But the Yamato won't go down.
Got that?
Get a move on!
Loaders!
Right, ready!
Left, ready!
Ready to fire.
What the hell are you doing?!
Anti-aircraft action!
Gunner ready!
Loaders!
Left ready!
- Center ready!
- Right Ready!
Ready to engage!
Gun Four ready!
Gun Two ready!
Gun Four ready!
Messenger, standing-by!
Hi-Angle AA Guns, ready!
Messengers ready
All hands in position.
Too slow. Repeat the drill
until it's 5 minutes faster.
Nishi, hold on.
Imbecile!
Dropping a goddamn shell!
We live or die together in the Navy.
One mistake and we're all dead.
You could've killed us all!
Stand.
Ass out.
Ass out.
Learn your lesson!
All hands in position.
Good enough.
It's a catastrophe.
Someone in our block
left a porthole open.
In wartime, it's inexcusable.
Worse, it was seen by other ships.
Yamato is disgraced.
The culprit is standing here.
Come forward now.
Right now!
If you do, I'll be lenient.
I understand.
Group responsibility, then.
No visits to the PX.
Indefinitely.
It was me.
You bastard...
All but Kamio, dismissed.
Spread your legs.
Hands up, grit your teeth!
Take over.
I can't do that.
Ignoring an order?
Do it.
Why not?!
Get up.
What the hell's that?!
It's sailors like you,
who let the ranks get soft.
Move.
Uchida, legs apart,
arms out, teeth grit.
Give me the pipe.
I'll beat Naval spirit into you.
I'm not done yet.
Bastard...
What did you try to do?
You hit the bone.
Bust my leg and I won't get to fight!
Think bullying cadets
can win the war?
Kamio, he hit a superior.
He won't get away with it.
What's the crime?
At worst, mutiny...
and a court martial.
Surely not.
We have to obey absolutely.
Didn't you close the hatch?
You goddamn idiot!
Playing the hero!
Shut up!
Kamio, I'm sorry.
It was me. Hit me, please.
I was thinking of the guys...
Not being a hero!
It's either each of you
for yourself...
Or all for one!
I'll talk to Chief Moriwaki.
Idiot!
It's no business for a recruit!
And nothing to do with my kitchen!
Get back to work!
Chief Moriwaki, sir!
Kamio from gunnery.
What the hell do you want?
Moriwaki... what is it?
Grub's up.
You're a pain in the ass.
My ass is my business.
Idiot.
One of the new kids... Kamio
came crying to me to help you.
Kamio did?
I spoke to Machimura.
He'll forget that you hit him,
if you forget he nearly
broke your leg.
I'm not worried about myself.
If he vows not to hit others,
tell him I'll call it quits.
Always so noble-minded...
In battle, you don't know
who'll get hit.
Survivors have to take over.
Kamio...
This handle controls elevation.
When you're on target, that pedal
is the trigger.
Elevation 45 degrees.
Take aim!
Other way, idiot!
Mizutani.
This controls the gun's bearing.
Right, 30 degrees.
Take aim!
Okay...
Elevation 60 degrees,
bear right 45 degrees.
Take aim!
An enemy fighter travels
If you react slowly, if the gun jams,
you're all killed in action.
Dead men can't fight.
So you fight to survive.
That's why we drill.
Don't you forget it!
Are you okay?
Get water and sea-sick tablets.
I'm fine.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
Take this
Thank you.
It'll get rougher.
If we're turning back
we do it now.
I'll be okay.
Please let me go.
You dig your heels in
just like your Dad.
I'm not his real daughter.
After the war, he went back to Nagoya
eventually adopting 11 of us
over 15 years.
And began looking after orphans
Uchida did that?
Other people's kids?
On behalf of those
that didn't make it.
Didn't make it?
People killed in the war.
There were over 3,000
on the Yamato alone.
"Early Summer, 1944"
You're lucky, being close to home.
What are you all going to do?
I'm going to the baths.
Haven't been for a week.
I'm going to the movies.
Mizutani, want to come?
A movie, huh? It's been ages.
Nishi, you?
I wonder...
If you've nothing else,
want to come to my house?
Is that okay?
Of course it is.
See you.
That's Kure,
where the Yamato was built.
Let's go.
Kamio...
Is there a post office?
Uncensored letters,
can get you court-martialed.
Please, don't tell anyone.
Don't worry, I'm teasing.
It's just there.
Thanks.
Mother, I'm sending you some money.
Here's your receipt, 4 yen, 75 sen.
Let's wash our hands and go pray.
Kamio!
Taeko!
Aunty and I prayed every day
for your return.
Thanks.
This is Nishi.
A friend from the cadet corps.
Nishi, sir!
Why don't you draw her picture?
He's great at drawing.
Got any paper?
I'll go get some.
Hey, Mom!
Since his brother got drafted
and went off to fight
no-one uses this boat any more.
Don't move or he'll draw
you like a witch.
No, make me beautiful.
Taeko, you already are.
Really?
How nice!
He always talks about you.
Nishi, keep your mouth shut!
Let's go.
Mom's made sweet bean soup.
Hurry up!
It's really good.
He made you into a beauty.
Thanks to the model.
Of course, I am really pretty
Of course...
Nishi's Father died.
Killed in combat in Shanghai.
Then why did you join up?
We're peasant farmers, no cash income.
Would you like some more?
Every family has a story
"Banzai" they said,
and two of mine gave themselves
for the country.
The war will be over soon.
My brother will be back.
I'll be waiting for you both.
Don't get yourself killed.
"June 15th, 1944"
"US forces land on Saipan, breaching"
"Japan's defensive perimeter."
"All defenders meet brave"
"and heroic end."
Nonsense
I didn't lie
You are a liar
You guys are making a damn racket.
What's the matter?
I said what's the damn problem!?
He says that Saipan's defense
fought to the death.
I heard it from the officers
on the bridge.
Kamio says if Saipan falls
Japan is lost.
So he refuses to believe me.
Accused me of spreading lies.
Kamio, it's true that Saipan fell.
What'll you do about it?
Run? Surrender?
Neither. Fight.
Fight with every ounce of strength!
What about you?
To protect Japan, I'll fight to the end!
Is that right...
Fight for it
Sweet potato cakes.
Share them out.
Make yourselves popular.
Thank you very much.
Leading Seaman, Tamaki, sir.
Chief Moriwaki ordered me here.
Mom sent an amulet for you
in our care package.
Sumio...
Even if you were put up for adoption,
don't be so hard-headed.
She's still your mother.
If anyone bullies you,
tell them you're my brother.
No way.
I will not tell them.
That's the dagger you got
from Admiral Yamamoto?
It's my treasured possession.
He must have really valued
your work for him.
I treasure this with my life.
Hope that doesn't get put to the test.
"October 17th, 1944"
"US forces assault Leyte Gulf"
"via the Sulu Straits."
"They land on Leyte island October 20th."
"0800 Yamato and 40 others, departed Brunci,
course: North, Speed:18 knots"
"Attack on all fronts, good luck."
Get away from it
Watch out The front
Get away from it
Open fire!
I'll take over!
You're in charge.
Again, fire
Left 30, elevation 40 degrees!
Load the bullet, ready
Elevation 50!
Where's Uchida?
Directing fire up top.
Right 20!
Uchida!
PO Uchida.
Back to your posts!
Uchida!
Uchida!
Please treat him.
Treat him please!
Please treat him.
Treat him!
Hurry up
Men that can rejoin the fight
go first.
In 5 days of combat in Leyte Gulf
The Combined Fleet lost 3 battleships,
Surviving ships had extensive damage.
Japan's Surface Fleet
was practically annihilated.
Tokita!
Get changed and go
to the weather deck.
That's out of bounds for us, sir.
Do what I say!
Querying the Captain's thoughtfulness?
Move!
That was his brother, huh?
Your brother died a hero.
I know he used to beat you...
I'm sorry.
Salute!
Petty Officer 1st Class Takamura...
Leading Seamen Tamaki...
Salute!
At ease.
Brother!
Farewell!
Uchida lost his left eye
and was shot through his shoulder
and hip, too.
Serious wounds.
He was hospitalized in Singapore.
Then sent to Kure to recover.
It's the first I heard about it.
He never talked about himself.
Only about Moriwaki and Karaki,
and of course,
you and the other cadets.
Thank you.
Salute Vice-Admiral lto!
At ease.
I'll show you to your quarters, sir.
Aboard the newly-repaired Yamato.
Commander of 2nd Fleet,
Vice-Admiral Seichi lto
took his command.
On March 10th, 1945.
US bombers from Saipan,
began indiscriminate
bombing of urban areas.
That night alone, huge areas
of Tokyo were razed.
Further firebomb raids then followed
on Nagoya and Osaka.
On March 19th
a force of 70 planes raided
Hiroshima and Kure
aiming for shipping
and the naval boatyards.
"Several days later,"
"hundreds of fighters and bombers"
"launched massive aerial attacks"
"on every one of Okinawa's airfields"
Petty Officer Karaki.
What?
We heard rumor that Yamato's
heading for Okinawa.
If Okinawa falls
the homeland is threatened.
Our Kamikaze hit
the US Task Forces every day.
The Yamato can't sit around
doing nothing.
You've all been through Leyte
so you appreciate...
who's to die...
when we die...
no-one knows.
We're all fully prepared
to give our lives.
Every one of us!
Look what arrived...
Attention, elder sons or those
who are sole support of families
Tokita.
Come here.
You lost your elder brother.
Sign this and you can leave the ship.
I can't leave by myself.
Who'll support your mother?
I was sent for adoption.
I have no mother.
I'll fight to the end with my mates.
Really.
Back to bed.
Excuse me, sir.
The Cadets said they're ready
to give their lives.
Damn...
Just a bunch of kids...
They've got no idea
what death means...
What?
Dat? From Signals, sir.
May I ask a question?
What is it?
Below decks, I heard
you'd been discussing chivalry.
What's the difference between
chivalry and bushido?
Please tell me.
Simply put, bushido
readies us for death with no reward.
Chivalry, eschews thoughts of death
and looks to honorable living.
One prepares for life
the other for death?
Am I right?
Preparation for either
is no simple matter.
My Mother and sister
are a stone's throw from Okinawa.
Whatever it takes.
I want to protect them.
"March 25th, 1945"
"Knowing it was for the last time"
"they headed ashore for final leave."
Long time, no see.
Welcome back, sir.
Souvenirs...
You're so kind.
I'm up in the room.
Take a nice, long bath.
And you, Chief?
I've got to be somewhere.
Don't forget, tomorrow, 0800.
Your room's this way.
Son...
Why are you here?
Moriwaki-san cabled me.
Chief Moriwaki?
You're lucky he's your officer.
It's a lock of brother's hair.
He died a splendid death.
Have some of my cakes.
My sugar ration was tiny
so they're not so sweet.
Quick, eat up...
Have another.
Here's tea, too...
Mother, I go off to serve my country.
How are the fields?
Mother, I beg you please,
please try to...
Forget me...
Goodbye.
Forgive me, please.
Forgive me.
Taeko
What's wrong?
Your Mom's death...
it was my fault.
Forgive me!
What happened?
Stop crying and tell me!
It was the attack on March 19th...
Aunty?
Aunty!
My brother died.
Now...
I'm all alone.
Kamio...
The Yamato's going to Okinawa.
Will you die, too?
Don't...
Don't...
Please don't...
You can't die.
Taeko
I'm scared of dying but...
My brother died, my Mother died...
In Tokyo, Osaka,
tens of thousands died...
Many people are killed by an air attack
I don't want more people to die
I'll go to Okinawa...
to hell and back, if needed.
Kamio...
I don't understand.
If you die...
If you die, what about me?
I love you.
I love you so much!
How are you, huh?
Long time no see.
Doc couldn't believe it.
Someone with that many wounds
surviving...
I'm like the Yamato, unsinkable.
Get well soon.
I need a sparring partner.
Have you got time
to come hang out here?
I thought I should bring these.
I was looking after them.
Your treasured possessions.
The Okinawa sortie, huh?
When?
What are you talking about?
You came to say farewell?
Hospital's made you go soft
in the head.
The sakura look pretty this year.
Falling petals...
Remaining petals...
All fall in the end.
Let's leave it at that.
No ticket. Can't come.
We are well.
Hey son. Daddy's here.
With 3 days' warning, I can get
a ticket to come see you off.
Don't cry, Kazuo.
Playing hooky from work?
Why are you here?
I snuck out of hospital.
What happened to your eye?
Why didn't you tell me?
Military secret.
Since when did you care
about military rules?
You always found a way
to come see me, legal or not.
Anyway...
You don't care about my feelings.
Take it.
It's no big deal. Go on.
My dear...
You can't go to Okinawa like that.
I'm convalescing in Kure.
I just slipped out to see you.
So you aren't going anywhere.
Right.
Then I shouldn't take this off you.
Don't be stupid.
What if a bomb falls on me.
Then it'll all be over.
Nowadays, you'd better keep it
What?
You never talk like this.
Give me a break.
Will you just take it?
Stop.
I'm not ready for a woman yet.
I just want to hold you.
You don't have to do anything.
I just want to feel you
against my skin.
Lie down.
Come here.
Really?
When the war's over
make me your wife.
Maybe before then
I'll have turned into a ghost.
Makes no difference.
I'll be back in Hiroshima
waiting for you.
All bets in.
