Do you know him?
Uhh!
Rambo!
Rambo! Rambo! Rambo! Rambo!
Rambo!
John!
John!
John!
John Rambo!
I don't believe this.
So where did you come in from?
Washington.
Good to see you again.
Yeah. You, too.
You want to, uh,
tell me about it?
About what?
How yesterday
I see you stick fighting
in a warehouse in Bangkok.
You saw that?
Yeah. Today I find you
working in a monastery.
They let me live here,
and I help out, fixing things.
And the stick fighting?
I do that for a little
extra money.
Yeah. I saw you give
it to the monks.
You see a lot.
Colonel, who are they?
They're partly the
reason I'm here.
Bob.
This is Robert Griggs,
a field officer
with our local embassy.
John Rambo.
A pleasure. You're certainly
not easy to find.
Why are you keeping track?
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find.
John, I'd like you to
look at these photos.
I don't know how much
you know about Afghanistan.
Most people can't find it
on a map.
But over
two million civilians--
mostly peasant farmers
and their families--
have been systematically slaughtered
by invading Russian armies.
Every new weapon--
including chemical warfare--
has been used to eliminate
these people.
They've been
very successful
on many levels.
I assume you're
out of touch
with the current
status of the war.
After nine years
of fighting,
Afghan forces are getting
shipments of stinger missiles.
They're beginning to hold their
own against air strikes,
except for one region,
over the border.
The Soviet commander
there is brutal,
as those photos
indicate.
He's managed
to strangle off
all aid
from the outside.
So...We want to...
Investigate
the problem firsthand.
And what's that
got to do with me?
They've asked me
to go in.
You're not doing it?
Yes, and I want you
to come with me.
I put in my time.
What's that mean?
It means my war is over.
I thought you said
he was this great soldier.
Colonel, looks like we got a
long walk down those stairs.
Don't be down on him.
He's just following orders.
This mission's
important.
Do you really think
we'll make a difference?
If I didn't,
I wouldn't be going.
It didn't before.
That was another time.
Come with me, John.
I don't know what you
think about this place,
but I like it.
I like being here,
working here.
I like belonging
to something.
You do belong
to something,
not this.
When will you
come full circle?
What are you
talking about?
You said
your war is over.
Maybe the one
out there is,
but not the one
inside you.
I know the reasons
you're here,
but it doesn't
work that way.
You can't escape
what you are.
What's that?
A full-blooded
combat soldier.
Not anymore.
I don't want it.
That's too bad.
You're stuck with it.
Let me tell you
a story.
A sculptor found
this special stone.
He worked on it
for months,
until he finally
finished it.
His friends said he'd
created a great statue.
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.
The statue
was always there.
He just cleared away
the small pieces.
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.
We just chipped away
the rough edges.
You'll always
tear away at yourself
until you come to terms
with what you are,
until you come
full circle.
I guess I'm not ready yet.
Hmm.
Well,
I got to move.
Promise me
you'll look me up
when you get
stateside, huh?
I promise.
Colonel.
I'm sorry... but it's got
to end for me sometime.
I understand.
Take cover!
Ohh!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Drop your weapons
and remain where you are!
We will not attack
if you do not run!
You have no chance of escape!
Rambo.
Something went wrong.
What happened?
Soviets intercepted the
team just over the border.
Trautman and the rest
of his party
have been taken to
a regional command post.
What are you
doing about it?
We can't do anything
about it.
I'm sorry.
I just thought
you should know.
What about me?
What about you?
Can you get me in?
You're not serious?
Oh, yeah,
I'm serious.
It can't be done
officially.
Make it unofficial.
I want you to know
up front
that if you're captured
or any of this leaks,
we'll deny
any participation
or even knowledge
of your existence.
I'm used to it.
I'll get back to you.
You want to buy?
Many guns here.
No.
I'm looking for
Mousa gani.
What's your name?
John Rambo.
Wait here.
They sell many
in Afghanistan.
Many land mines.
Land mines everywhere.
I am Mousa gani.
What is it you want?
I was sent by Griggs.
You do not look like man
Griggs sent before.
You not look like
you are with military.
I'm not.
What you are?
A mercenary?
No.
You're not military
or mercenary.
What are you?
Lost tourist?
I'm no tourist.
Sorry.
Do you know where
the American is?
Yes.
In Soviet fort,
near the village
of khowst,
over border.
Mr. Griggs send supplies
you wanted.
You wish to
see them now?
Yeah.
Is this what
you asked for?
Yeah.
What are these?
Detonators.
And this?
What is this for?
It's a blue light.
What does it do?
Turns blue.
I see.
How many more men
come with us?
There's no rescue team.
Just me.
Just you?
I cannot take only one
man to the fort.
You need more men.
Griggs said
you'd take me in.
I am needed to take
medical supplies.
If I not take it,
many people die.
I do not know
who you really are,
but by the way you look,
I can see you have
no experience in war.
I've fired a few shots.
Ha ha ha ha!
A few shots?
Come on. Maybe you should go back home
and think it
all over again
for
a very long time.
Ha ha ha ha!
I did think it over.
You did?
Well,
this is your choice.
But let me tell you,
you cannot get
this American alone.
If you fail,
do not blame me.
I will accept
no responsibility.
That sounds familiar.
Uhh!
Aah!
I'm Colonel Zaysen,
regional commander
of this sector.
Do you realize
you're the first American
captured in Afghanistan?
Congratulations.
I believe you are planning
to supply enemy rebel forces
with stinger missiles intended
to destroy Soviet aircraft.
If I'm going to
be interrogated,
I want to be interrogated
by your superiors.
Out here,
I have no superiors.
I am in full command.
You are alone here...
Abandoned by
your government.
What do you want?
Cooperation.
This sector has been
under total control
for over five years.
There is little more
I can do here.
It is, as you say,
without challenges.
If you supply to me
worthy information
about more stinger missiles
you are planning to deliver,
it could provide a way
out of this for us both.
After all, in the end,
what everyone really wants
is peace.
The kremlin's got
a sense of humor.
Please explain.
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,
and you're wiping out
a race of people.
We are wiping out
no one.
I think you are
too intelligent
to believe such
absurd propaganda.
Where are the missiles?
I don't know anything
about any missiles!
You don't realize
I'm providing a way out
for us both.
You expect sympathy?
You started this war!
Now you deal with it!
And we will.
It's just a matter of time
before we achieve victory.
There won't be
a victory!
Every day you lose ground to
poorly armed freedom fighters.
You underestimated
your competition.
These people have never
given up to anyone.
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.
You can't defeat
a people like that.
We tried.
We already had our Vietnam!
Now you're
going to have yours.
So...You wish to test me!
Good.
Uhh!
This is Afghanistan.
Alexander the great tried
to conquer this country,
then genghis Khan,
then the British.
Now Russia.
But Afghan people
fight hard.
They'll
never be defeated.
Ancient enemy make prayer
about these people.
You wish to hear?
It says,
"may God deliver us
"from the venom
of the cobra,
"teeth of the tiger,
and the vengeance
of the Afghan."
You understand
what this means?
That you guys
don't take any shit?
Yes.
Something like this.
We go now.
To the north
are many caves.
We will travel
through them.
This leads to the valley
of five lions.
In ancient days,
the Afghan king
was asked to send 500
warriors into battle.
He said, "only five."
His greatest five.
And they won.
He said, "it's better
to send five lions
than 500 sheep."
What do you think?
The king was lucky.
How much longer
to the village?
About two hours.
Where in my sector are
the missiles being delivered?
I don't know.
You're a liar.
Ooh!
Uhh!
Where?
All right.
I knew you were lying.
Now, where are
the missles located?
Close.
How close?
In your ass.
Oh!
Uuh!
You've tried my patience
long enough.
I tried to be civilized.
The name John Rambo...
Do you know it?
No?
He says there are plans
for a rescue attempt
with the help
of some rebels.
He also says he knows
where this man is going.
We will welcome him.
Aah!
It's the last village
in the valley.
About 100 men here.
They have a lot
of kids here.
Yes, and they are
good fighters, too.
I tell the leaders
we want to talk.
They never see man
look like you.
These are
mujahedeen horsemen.
are waiting at the border
to get weapons.
When they get it,
they come back here to fight.
Let's go to
the hospital.
He's the only doctor
for 500 kilometers.
The first medicine
they get in two months.
More gifts
from the Soviets.
They look like toys,
but they are mines.
We teach children
not to touch.
Some learn too late.
Who's that?
His name is uri.
He's Russian.
Deserter?
A defector.
There are many like him.
He's the one
who can help the most.
He knows the inside
of the fort.
I think
we should go now.
Shh!
Mine starts here
at 1 meter like this,
then go 2 meter
like this,
and like this.
They have four towers,
four guards--
here, here, here,
and here.
Where are
the prisoners kept?
Here.
If we get in, is there
another way out?
Underground,
where is all the bad water.
I do not know words
for this place.
He means sewer.
Where is it?
Here.
Outside, it goes there.
Guards patrol there.
I do not think
you go this way.
We should go through
the mine fields.
This cannot be done.
There are many spetnaz
commandos. We are only this.
We have lost many men.
We lose more if we go there.
I don't need many men.
What is it
you want to do?
I need two men to get
me through the mines
and two
to help with the escape.
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,
and more people will die.
I can't wait.
You must wait for help
the way we wait!
Then I'll go alone.
And you will die.
Then I die.
Wait.
Please don't go.
My name is Masoud.
You must not judge us
before you understand why
we are not ready to help.
Most of the Afghan people
are very strong,
and we are determined
not to be driven from our land.
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas,
and the women are raped
and killed.
Last year,
in the valley of laghman--
the next valley--
Pregnant women
were cut with bayonets
and their babies
thrown into the fires.
This is done
so they will not have to fight
the next generation
of Afghans.
Yet nobody sees anything
or reads anything in the papers.
What you see here
are the mujahedeen soldiers,
holy warriors.
To us,
this war is a holy war.
And there's no true death
for a mujahedeen
because we have taken
our last rites.
We consider ourselves
dead already.
To us, death for our land
and God is an honor.
So, my friend,
what we must do
is to stop this killing
of our women and children.
If getting this man free
so he can return
to the free world
and tell what happens here
is necessary,
then of course
we will help.
Leave us now
so we may speak
among ourselves
and find the best way
to free this man.
Thank you.
We thank you.
They will decide soon.
Got to get
in tonight.
What is your name?
This boy is
very hard inside.
His parents were
killed last year.
His brother died in the
fort where the American is.
He looks like a boy,
but he fights
like a man.
What is your name?
Rambo.
Where are you from?
Arizona.
How much days walk?
Oh,
about two years.
Two years.
Are you a soldier?
No more.
I am a soldier.
Yeah?
Are you here to fight?
No.
Are you scared?
What is this?
It's a knife.
Can I see this?
Sure.
Very good.
Can I have it?
No.
What is this?
You want everything.
This is for luck.
What is luck?
Luck is, uh...
Oh.
Can I have it?
I need luck.
So do I.
Look what a child.
Always like this.
Look there.
It's
a national sport.
Old insane game,
maybe 3,ooo years old.
They never stop
playing it.
War, not war,
they don't mind.
You like it?
I'll take football.
Football?
What's football?
You play it with your foot?
Not really.
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
Hey, American!
What are they saying?
They want you
to try.
It's a way to
welcome you.
You want to try,
go ahead,
but I'm not
responsible for it.
I'll try.
Yes?
What are the rules?
Take the sheep
once around
and throw it
in the circle.
Why?
Because there is
a circle there.
That's it?
That's it.
Very simple.
Like football.
God must love
crazy people.
Why?
He makes so many
of them.
Ha ha ha ha!
Huh! Huh!
Aah!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Move! Move! Move!
Ahhhhh!
Uhh!
Now you see
how it is here.
Somewhere
in war,
there's supposed
to be honor.
Where is
the honor here?
Where?
We are taking the survivors
to the border.
Are you coming?
I'm going to
the fort.
Have you not seen
enough death?
Go.
Go while you can.
This is not
your war.
It is now.
So be it.
You are
a good friend.
I will show you
the way.
I will go,
too.
No. You go with them.
They kill
all my family.
I want to fight.
Not with me.
You go.
Go on.
Why must you
do this?
Because he'd do it
for me.
Have you decided
to talk?
No?
Very well.
Soon you will be
my guest down the hall.
Come on.
Go back!
No!
Shhh!
Go on.
Stay here.
I know this place.
You need me.
I don't need you dead.
Go back!
Let's go, sir!
Come on!
The American.
American.
Colonel?
Colonel?
John, how the hell
did you get in here?
Can you move?
You're damn right
I can.
Let's go.
John, behind you!
Go!
John! Get out!
Get the hell
out of here!
Go on!
Over here!
Come on!
Help me!
Take him.
Go on!
Give me the boy.
Come on!
Ok.
Take the kid.
Get down!
Give me the boy.
Who is this terrorist?
What makes you
so valuable to him?
This bastard tried to
destroy me tonight,
but he failed!
At sunrise,
I'll hunt him down
and hang his skin
on the wall!
You don't have to
hunt him.
He'll find you.
Are you insane?
One man
against thirty commandos?
Who do you think
this man is?
God?
No. God would
have mercy.
He won't.
It's all right.
Nobody's there.
This will hold
a while.
What's the fastest
way out?
Northwest.
There is trail
between mountains...
About 3 kilometers
from here.
The trail
is very difficult.
You take the boy
and go.
I want to stay.
You can't.
You cannot
go back there.
We must go
to Pakistan.
I've got to go back.
I know he's your friend,
but you cannot do this.
You both will die.
For what?
Just do what I say.
Let me have your gun.
All right.
Let's go.
Come on.
I see you again?
Sure.
Aah!
Aah!
Move! Move!
Come on!
Can you fly
that thing?
Let's find out.
Let's go!
Hurry!
Get on board!
Hold on!
Over there!
There!
Hold on!
Get them!
Take my hand!
Aaah!
We're going down!
Hold on!
Get out of here!
It's going to blow!
Take what you can,
John!
Come on!
We got to get
to the border.
We'll stay here.
We know where to go.
Which direction, John?
Northeast.
Hold it, John.
I got to rest
a minute.
How's the wound?
You taught us
to ignore pain, didn't you?
Is it working?
Not really.
Don't take it personally.
Thanks.
You go on ahead and see
if you can find some cover.
No!
John!
John!
That was close,
John.
How are you?
Well-done.
We don't want to make
it easy for him.
Let's split up.
I'm sorry I got you
into this.
No, you're not.
Are you listening?
Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
That's good timing.
What are friends for?
Get back
to the hole.
I'll cover you
and see if there's any left.
John!
Across the valley
is the border.
We did it, John.
Yeah.
Wait.
What the hell
is that?
The son of a bitch.
Do not try to retreat.
You cannot escape.
We won't attack
if you do not run.
We don't want to hurt you.
I don't
believe him.
I order you to come forward.
You will receive a fair trial.
Drop your weapons
and remain where you are.
You got any ideas?
Drop your weapons.
Surrounding them
is out.
Hell of a time
for humor, John.
Drop the weapons. Now!
You have no chance of escape.
Come forward.
I wish to
take you back alive.
This is your last warning.
The choice is yours.
What do you say?
Fuck 'em!
If we're going to go,
I wish we'd taken
that bastard with us.
What is that?
It's the rebels.
Come on!
John, get out of there!
John!
You don't want
to stay?
You fight good
for a tourist.
Maybe next time.
You want
this back?
No. You keep it.
Can you not stay?
I've got to go.
Good-bye.
Hard to believe,
John.
What's that, sir?
I hate to admit it,
but the truth is,
I think
we're getting soft.
Maybe just
a little, sir.
Just a little.
The road is long
with many a winding turn
that leads us
to who knows where
who knows where
but I'm strong
strong enough to carry him
he ain't heavy
he's my brother
so on we go
his welfare is my concern
no burden is he
to bear
we'll get there
for I know
he would not encumber me
he ain't heavy
he's my brother
if I'm laden at all
I'm just laden with sadness
that everyone's heart
isn't filled
with the gladness
of love
for one another
it's a long, long road
from which
there is no return
and while we're on our way
to there
why not share
yes, and the load
the load does not
weigh me down
down at all
he ain't heavy
he's my brother
lord, he ain't heavy
lord, he's my brother
he ain't heavy
he ain't heavy
he's my brother
oh, when the road gets long
I may get a little bit weary
but I know
I can carry him
he's my brother
and he ain't heavy
he ain't heavy
oh, no
it's a long, long
it's a long, long road
and he ain't heavy
he ain't heavy
oh, no
it's a long, long
it's a long, long
long, long, long road
