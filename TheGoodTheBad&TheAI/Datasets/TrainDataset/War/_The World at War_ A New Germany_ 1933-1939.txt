For this road,
in one day of Summer of 1944,
the soldiers had arrived.
Not deferred payment nobody here now.
They had been only some hours.
When they had left, the community that
it lives a thousand years here, had perished.
We are in Oradour-sur-Glane,
in France.
In the day where the soldiers had arrived,
the people was congregated.
The men had been taken
for garages and granaries.
The women and the children
they had been led by this road
e lead for this church.
Here, they had heard the detonations,
when the men had been fusilladed.
Later, they had also been deceased.
Weeks later, many of that
they had also killed them had been died.
. in combat.
Oradour never was reconstructed.
Its ruins are a memorial.
Its capital punishment represents
of thousand of others in the Poland,
in Russia, the Birmânia, China.
. in a world in war.
The World in War
New Germany 1933 - 1939
Germany, 1933.
An enormous and blind enthusiasm
it fulls the streets.
National-Socialism gains the power,
in a country tortured over the unemployment,
amargurado for the loss of territory,
demoralized for the weakness politics.
Perhaps either the new start.
The majority considers the nazistas
a little obsessive nonsenses and,
but perhaps the time of the thought
it has finished.
Adolf Hitler did not take the power.
They had offered it, when its
to be able of vote was in decline.
The politicians who had made of Hitler
chancellor had said:we contract "it".
The main figure of them was
the old president von Hindenburg.
The socialist Communists and
they had tried to face Hitler with calm:
"This will not last", had said.
The anti-nazistas conservatives
if they tranquilizaram with the fact
of that its old leader of the war,
Hindenburg, still state head,
to be known by
to disdain the mediocre handle.
Number 9082, Paul von Hindenburg.
Already it is?
With false solemnity,
Hitler and its sequidores
they had directed it foot to the cerimónia
of the opening of the parlamento.
The force of the party was constructed
from the revolutionary violence.
They had never imagined that they could
to arrive legally at the power.
When the old building of
Reichstag caught fire mysteriously,
Hitler grasped the chance stops
to suspend all the civil freedoms.
Its followers badly
they could believe its luck.
The old Hindenburg, symbol
of an apparent continuity,
she was still president, when they
they had transformed the government into being able,
with acts of pretense legality.
In March, when the Reichstag allowed that Hitler governed without Parliament,
Hindenburg did not make commentaries.
The legal chancellor adopted
the paper of the legal dictator.
Hitler proclaimed new Germany.
E had the intention of
that it lasted a thousand years.
New Germany started to surround
its enemies:Communists,
socialist, inopportune journalists,
members of the house of representatives of the Reichstag.
In the concentration camp
of Orienburg, to the north of Berlin,
the conditions, the principle, were
but hard but not brutais.
At this time, the fields were managed
for the Sections of Assault, the SA.
They maltreated more
of what they assassinated.
Since the beginning, Hitler advanced
with the campaign against the Jews.
As SA had organized boycotting
to the pertaining store the Jews.
The true reason was
to encourage the German people
to think and to act
in way anti-semitic.
The exterior world was horrified.
But those existed,
including Jewish Germans,
that they thought that the campaign
anti-semitic was workmanship of extremistas,
something with that Hitler would finish,
as soon as more was felt safe.
It would also go to give itself
a cultural revolution.
The German culture would be purged
of it stains Jewish and bolchevista.
The books had been played to the flames.
Many of they had played that them
they were pupils and professors.
E to the measure that fagulhas went up,
the intellectuals ran away,
writers and scientists,
to offer its talentos
to the Europe Occidental person and America.
One hundred years before, Heine,
German poet of Jewish ancestry,
whose books were now
played to the flames, it informs:
"Where if they burn books,
they will finish if burning people."
Some of most zealous
followers of Hitler
they had found new ways
to show loyalty.
They had been married or they come back if to marry
under the rules of the nazista ritual.
The nazistas had the support
bulk of the unemployeds,
but less of
organized workers.
The left section of the party
it wanted to initiate a movement
of workers in the plants.
But Hitler followed
a simpler route.
It granted to the unions the holiday
of the Day of the Worker as they wanted.
In the following day, it abolished the unions.
The followers of nazism were
basically of the middle class.
Storekeepers ruined for the depression,
employees who had lost
its savings,
excuídos craftsmen
for the production in mass.
These were the adoradores of Hitler.
Of this army of ruined they made
part agriculturists and peasants.
Hitler signs up them
during the Depression.
Now it said that its blood to them
alone e was the treasure of Germany.
It approved laws granting to them
ownership of its lands. E gave bread to them.
The Treated one to Versailles in 1919 reduces the German territory drastically.
They had lost the Alsácia,
Lorena and the Sarre.
The east of the Prússia was isolated
for the new Polish state;
the Silésia divided in two;
Danzig, a city
of Liga of the Nations.
For the patriots,
Germany would not be free
while Versailles lasted.
Hitler seemed to be the rescuer foreseen in monuments in the border:
"German, never they forget
what hatred stole the blind you.
They wait the hour that will avenge
the bloody crime of the border."
Except, it had who admired
the way as Germany if defended.
In America, we had many reports against its new government
e, many times, had caused
hasty demonstrations.
Now, I can say voces
that the American people, today,
it knows that these histories are
false and they do not have bedding.
I find that it has a new vitality
here in Germany,
with its great leader and chancellor,
Adolf Hitler, that I admire very.
New Germany will construct for you
optimum centered government
of the current world.
New Germany was a set
of different interests and hurts,
kept together for the belt
of the Socialist National Party.
E the buckle of the belt was Hitler.
The well most precious one in the Land
he is our people.
E for this people,
e with this people,
we will battle and fight,
e never we will fraquejaremos,
we will never tire in them,
we will never vacilaremos,
we will never despair.
Alive our movement!
Alive our people!
In the truth, it was the only party
that it promised to take off us of the abyss.
E the main idea
it was that alone it would be possible
if we created a nation
with team spirit,
with solidarity, and all
making the same effort,
instead of fighting due
the small differences of opinion,
to the external politics and the social politics, and there for ahead.
What it promised?
Work and bread for the masses,
the millions of workers
unemployeds and with hunger.
Today, in our prosperous society,
work and bread already not
they mean nothing,
but, at the time, they were
a basic necessity
e this promise, that not
it would make any direction today,
at the time it seemed
the promise of the Paradise.
Everything this became the ideal land
a prophet to say:
"Levaei them it the Engaged Land.
Livraei them of the evil"
Who wants that said this,
it would be greeted with enthusiasm.
Clearly that it had who said:
"This is a false prophet",
but who could know
if certain or they were made a mistake?
At the time, nobody wise person.
Christmas of 1933:
one year of the Reich de Hitler.
"Peace in the Land -
Good will between the men."
The concentration camps
they were full,
the Parliament was only
one appears decorative;
the political parties
e the abolished unions;
the Jews are of the public services;
the strangled free press;
the destroyed personal freedoms.
Germany lived in a permanent one
emergency state.
The state of Adolf Hitler
he was sovereign, exactly Almighty.
But it still felt itself threatened.
It feared its old rivals
conservatives. The army feared.
E also the sections of its party
that still they were revolutionary,
as the leaders
of the Sections of Assault.
also the army hated the SA.
Hitler saw as to conciliate the generals
e to clean its way.
The head of the SA was one of its
old comrades, Ernst Röhm.
In 30 of June of 1934
Röhm was imprisoned.
. and died.
The commanders of the SA.
e more than one hundred others
they had been removed of its beds
e also died.
The murder blew up
for all Germany.
The assassins were
new force in Germany,
the SS, the bodyguards
of Hitler,
they became its now
private agreement of terror.
Goering gave a conference
in the Ministry of the Propaganda.
Goebbels was Minister of the Propaganda,
but it had been with Hitler,
therefore Goering detestava it
e could have grasped the chance
of if exempting of it, being in Berlin.
Goering gave the conference
for the foreign press.
Before this, the communication was
cut for the foreign countries.
Goering entered and said:
"I know that vocês they like histories", it used the word in English.
"Therefore I have one
good history for vocês."
E described as in
previous night and in this morning
it and Hitler had acted
against not conforming forces,
as much of the Right as of the Left,
that Röhm had been fusilladed
e one second jammed revolution.
It also made a obscure reference
to the general von Schleicher,
that it had preceded Hitler
as German chancellor.
Later it left the room, came back
passed some seconds and it said:
"They had said me that I was not clearly
how much to the general von Schleicher.
The general von Schleicher was died
this morning, when it resisted the arrest."
it was one day very important,
because one became obvious
that this government, while government,
if it became an assassin.
They had killed
a great number of people
without them to take the court.
Simply they had killed them.
E not only enemy right-handers of Hitler
at the moment,
not only Röhm, the head of the SA,
but also other people
that they considered ackward.
E had made it at the same time.
In this Summer,
another rival disappeared.
President Hindenburg
he died in 2 of August.
While it still breathed,
Hitler abolished the president position,
proclaiming Führer and chancellor,
head of state and government.
E before its body esfriarr,
Hitler commands usurped it of the army.
The Armed Forces had paraded
to make a new oath.
When old they swore
loyalty to the Constitution,
now they were committed to Hitler,
personally, for the name.
Interest, for God.
e for this sacred empire.
that I will obey the Führer
of the empire and German people
Adolf Hitler.
For the officers German, an oath was almost physically real.
Hitler them had enclosed.
Now they could not disobeys it,
without disobeying to the Native land.
Interest.
Interest for God.
Interest for Adolf Hitler!
Adolf Hitler.
Hitler continued in front.
In the same month, the Germans
they had had that to go to the ballot boxes
to approve its ascension to
to be able state and governmental.
Now, the management for the threat,
propaganda, fake and fraud
it was functioning wonderfully.
Hitler obtained 90% of "Ya".
Four million had still voted "Nein".
Hitler proclaimed:
"In next a thousand years it will not have
another revolution in Germany."
The nazistas had nailed the doctrine
of the community of the people,
of if learning to be German
ones with the others.
The aid of Winter, the main collection of street for charity, was a symbol.
E the leaders of the party revealed
comrades of the people for the cameras.
Goering revealed:
a hero of the war, a man
that he laughs and he appreciated the life,
that it believed to be one
moderadora force in the party.
Josef Goebbels, the small one
Minister of the Propaganda,
to who they called
"dwarfed poisonous".
Its severity was feared,
but respected.
The right arm of Hitler, Rudolf Hess:
one appears intriguer for the masses.
The way of the nazistas to govern age
to be distant, but not to seem it.
All the classrooms were encouraged
to have the same meals:
the soldier, the head,
the workers, the banker.
The party believed the community,
but the industrials continued rich.
They had financed the nazistas, when
if it became probable that earned,
e now its orders were submitted it
without great sadnesses.
The businesses were
improving quickly.
The economy was improving
when the nazistas had arrived at the power.
But they had been with the credits,
speeding up the recovery
with an enormous program of workmanships
public for the unemployeds.
Other countries, where the unemployment
of the masses it persisted,
they observed Germany with envy.
Only one minute,
ladies and gentlemen.
Here it is something that must know.
lsto is workmanship of the Führer!
It is everything what they need to know.
The unemployeds
they had constructed the auto-road,
the first one of the world, joining
still villager Germany.
The auto-roads were also
for the personal pleasure,
inside of the facista notion
of the "force for the joy".
E had been presented not in such a way
as a transport system,
but as the triumph
of the national will,
on to other famous projects,
as new Berlin of the Führer.
Full of elegance and health,
confident and cliente
of its obligation and task,
thus they are the happy young
of our great age.
These are members
of the "Faith and Beauty",
predecessor
of Liga of the Young Germans,
feminine equivalent of
Hitlerista youth. E for measures there.
All the young
they learned songs of the party,
they practiced exercise,
they danced and they belonged to the group.
Every year,
the agriculturists and its families
they were congregated in Bückeberg with
Führer, at the time of the harvest.
In 1936, the ones that waited
its leader arrived at a million.
It was been slow. It always arrived
been slow; it increased the tension.
Later it arrived, leaving
the enthusiasm to overflow.
When passing in direction to the tribune,
the masses could see it
of close and until touching to it.
Deliberately, the women
they were placed in the first lines.
When it went up the hillside,
it did not perceive as the people
they could cry out in such a way.
But when it arrived at our group,
also I fell under its witchcraft,
e I cried out Heil as all people.
But later, when
it was very close,
greeting to the right and left,
pressing the hands and speaking,
e also pressed my hand,
I noticed that all immediately
to its side they were in silence.
In first the 10 minutes
it was not a good orator.
It started to heat
e to try to find words.
But, in the end, he was one
excellent communicator.
It. does not know the word in English. commanded its public
e all the atmosphere if
it became each histérica time.
He was interrupted,
to follow the almost all the phrases,
for great applauses
e the women cried out.
It was as a ceremony
religious in mass.
I heard the speech
e I felt the atmosphere
each excited time more in the hall
e, per some seconds,
I had the sensation, a time or another one:
"That penalty I not to be able to partilhar
the belief of these thousands of people,
to be alone, to be against everything this."
He was funny. I thought:"It is saying besteiras that already I know,
the besteiras that always said."
Exactly thus, it felt
that it had to be wonderful
to jump for the way
of the multitude in polvorosa
e to be part
of that they believed.
One lady of our city
it was Berlin,
to an anniversary party
of Adolf Hitler.
When it arrived, said us:
"The Führer pressed me it hand".
From then on, it was as one
saint in our city.
The private life of Hitler was transferred
in the Baviera, Berchtesgaden.
These images are of
films caretakers of Eva Braun,
the discrete young that
it was with it until a death.
The Berghof came the elect ones,
to take tea and to argue tactical.
Some a little bashful;
genuinely close others.
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler
It is the luminous Edelweiss
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler
It is the luminous Edelweiss
In exactly particular, Hitler it the same had that to be that if vendia the public.
Adolf with the children;
Adolf with the dogs;
Adolf with a lens;
Adolf with friends.
Taking a walk, as a good one
Bavarian bourgeois, to the sunday.
In this close circle,
Eva Braun was the natural woman,
healthful, happy with its body.
The favorite flower of Adolf Hitler
It is the luminous Edelweiss
In Berghof, it had bodyguard
good-tempered and friendly;
the other colds.
Heinrich Himmler, gentleman of the SS,
it came with Heydrich, its
terrible and beautiful lieutenant.
In formal occasions,
they appeared the guards of the SS.
They were the reality of the great tyranny
centered in distant Berlin.
Briefly, its hands would be
red with the blood of millions.
For this reality, Hitler
the beach chair would leave,
the parties and the loving one.
The car waited
in the end of the stairs.
If Germany again wanted to be
fort, had that to rearm itself.
A people scared for the war had
that to come back to make familiar itself to weapons,
to touch to them,
to play with the soldiers.
Germany had that to train pilots.
The Treated one to Versailles forbids
Germany to have an Air Force,
therefore the league of the sports
aerial it used gliders
to train men, still civil
officially, for the future Luftwaffe.
E the army increased for beyond
of the limits taxes for Versailles,
from the moment in
that Hitler if became chancellor.
In secret, it tripled
its force in two years.
Any foreign military attaché
he could see what he was happening.
But the world nothing made of decisive
e, in March of 1935,
Germany announced the conscription,
an army of peace time
of half million of men.
The new tanks had appeared.
The first squadrons
of the Luftwaffe they had flied.
The new German navy
it came the way.
Hitler kept the haunted Europe.
Proclaiming extinct Versailles,
it considered an armament limit.
Great-Britain, the first democracy to make a pact with the nazistas,
it signed a naval agreement.
Hitler was tranquilizou.
It could be safe to turn itself
for the hated borders.
One has left of the Treat one to Versailles
already it had been insult.
In January of 1935,
the territory of the Sarre,
the small region of coalmines
that she had been German before 1918,
it voted in mass, and under supervision
the International, to come back to Germany.
To the side, the Renânia remained
a demilitarized zone.
Without any dispute,
it was part of Germany,
but to recoup it would be to defy
the allies, above all France.
The troops had passed the bridges of the Reno
in 7 of March of 1936.
In secret, the commanders
they were ready if to remove
case France showed fight signals.
But these signals had not come.
Colony, in the Renânia, and Germany
they had expressed its relief and joy.
Part of the German honor
she had been recouped.
Hitler had risky and profit.
Two years later, Austria,
place of birth of Hitler,
she was ready to be annexed.
The Austrian nazistas fought for
Anschluss, union with Germany.
To hinder elections on
independence, Hitler annexed it.
The German troops had been greeted
for multitudes in she would histeria.
Vienna saw a terror against the Jews,
that nor Germany had seen.
Austria became a province.
The neighbors of Germany,
consternados, little firm
e little prepared,
one more time it swims had made.
The Tchecoslováquia
it was not a German province,
but an independent nation,
allied of Great-Britain,
of France and the Soviet Union.
In its border to the north
they lived the German Sudetas.
Hitler stirred up this minority,
that never it is part of Germany,
to demand the union with the Reich.
The Europe was prepared for the war.
But although the Tchecoslováquia
to be ready to fight,
Great-Britain and France had yielded.
In Munique, September of 1938,
Chamberlain, for Great-Britain,
Mussolini of the ltália
e Daladier of France
they had signed, with Hitler,
the treated one that it removed the region
of the Sudetas of the Tchecoslováquia,
leaving it incomplete and abandoning.
The Germans had crossed the border,
received as liberating
for the population sudeta.
In house, the generals German
that they opposed the Hitler,
to the wait that one disfigures
in the Tchecoslováquia
it finished with its prestige,
they had given up its conspiracies,
despaired.
Hitler joined it the troops in the field
e made plans for the future.
The region of the Sudetas
easily it was digested.
The remaining portion could be obtained
quickly.
The territories diminished Czechs e
the Eslováquia was abandoned.
It attacked in 15 of March of 1939.
The German troops had entered in Plague
in the same day, without resistance.
The last democracy
in the Central Europe it disappeared.
The Czechs never more
they would trust the Ocidente.
The Ocidente already did not trust Hitler
e was uncovered, finally,
that it would only withhold it to the force.
In Berlin, more
greetings, more veneration.
However, what they thought
the ones greeted that it?
Few wanted conquest wars,
or they dreamed, as Hitler,
with a German empire,
of the Urais until the Atlantic o.
The majority thought that it was
recouping what they had stolen to them
e restoring, not destroying,
the order and the unit of the Europe.
For these multitudes, the capacity
politics of Hitler never would fail.
Others, that had been in
house in this night,
they feared that was entered in war,
what it could destroy Germany.
But now they did not see hope
in one it raises against Hitler.
They had been with the moral question:
"It must be resisted a tyranny
without success hope?"
First, I find that it is difficult
to take the decision
of that if it must make something
against the government.
First of everything, it is very rare.
Later, if he is extremely dangerous,
as it is in a dictatorship,
still more it is complicated, because
all people likes its life.
Everything what it happened in them, when
we lived in Germany, was gradual.
It was perhaps part in the way as
Hitler managed these subjects.
The drop arrived us drop, as
an anesthetic, could be said.
When something only specific E that it
it made reached in them personally
he is that we we discovered,
of truth, what it was transferred.
In mine case in particular,
I can say that me
it reached personally
when the Jewish doctor
of my children,
that it had been always,
it came in our house.
He was a busy man very, but
more time seemed to have each time.
I remember that a night came
e was with my very sick son.
Of morning, the child was better
e, when it went even so,
he asked to me if I wanted that
it continued to see the children.
I was tired and said:
"My God, because not?
E it said me that the clinic stops
children who start in Hamburg
it went to be destruida. went to be dismissed
e that received letters
threatening that they said
that if it put the hands in
Aryan children, would have problems.
In November of 1938, a Jew
he killed a German diplomat in Paris.
The nazistas leaders
they had organized a retaliation.
Synagogs had been burnt and store
Jewish pilhadas in Germany.
In this "Night of Crystal", call
thus for the glass broken in the gutters,
thousands of Jews had been taken
for the concentration camps.
A terrible night!
It wants to know as was that night?
If it wants to know, I I say to it.
We were ranks all together,
they had beaten them, they given them murros,
e had made them to be of foot, in lines,
to be counted.
Because he had been welded,
I did not find this very difficult,
but to who it is not tacked
as it had, they beat to them soon.
E worse was when somebody grasped
a strong man great e.
It said:"He does not grasp me". "What?
I cannot grasp? "and they had beaten to it.
This man soon was grasped
for three people, of the SS.
They had brought a block.
It had moored it and
commander of the field said:
"The Israel Jew, or the Idzic Jew,
I do not obtain to remember to me,
it was sentenced the 25 chicotadas."
It came an enormous man, of the SS,
with a whip and it beat to it.
First, the man alone moaned
a little, but later cried out:"They stop"
The commander said:
"What it wants to say with "They stop"?
We go to start denovo".
But after more three chicotadas,
the blood gushed out,
they had stopped and they rubbed salt in the wounds,
or pepper, I do not remember.
The man was taken dragged.
Never more the vi.
Clearly that in 1938, when
the synagogs were catching fire,
all we knew what it was transferred.
I remember that my brother-in-law,
husband of my Lena sister,
Owner of house when she left
in the morning after.
Kristallnacht, Reichs Kristallnacht,
Crystal night, as vocês says,
it was of train
for the office in the center
e enters the stations of Savignyplatz
e Zoologischer Garten
it had a synagog
e it saw that it was catching fire.
It murmured "Kulturschande",
that it is an insult for the culture,
our culture must have shame.
Soon the man of the front turned itself
e showed the Parteiabzeichen,
card of the party, and showed to it
the wallet of the Gestapo.
E it had that to show documents,
to give the address, and was commanded it
that it was to the office of the party
in the following day, to the 9 of the morning.
April of 1939:
the Wehrmacht is prepared
to celebrate the 50 years of Hitler.
It waits one "day of the habitual Führer"
- a beautiful day.
The Führer crosses Berlin, passes
under the Vestibule of Brandenburgo
e goes down the Siegesallee,
the avenue of the victories.
The army, of both the sides,
it increased seven times in four years.
Between the 51 divisions
of the Wehrmacht
they are the new tanks,
the instrument of the Blitzkrieg.
Although the appearances,
the High Command not yet is certain
that this army this soon
for the war. still.
Hitler is ready
for showing the opposite to them.
The word in each colloquy
diplomatics in this Summer was Danzig.
The Free City, with its population
mixing of Germans and Poles,
she had been separate of Germany
e been under the responsibility of
a commissioner of Liga of the Nations.
Danzig and the east of the Prússia
they were separate of the Reich
for a band of Polish territory
- the Corridor.
Hitler demanded the devolution of Danzig
e access to the Prússia for the Corridor.
The Poland refused.
In March of 1939, Great-Britain e
France had guaranteed the borders to it.
In August, Great-Britain promised
to fight if the Poland was attacked.
One more time, myths on
the persecution of a German minority
they had been used to defend
an intervention armed.
Refugee German counted
histories of the Polish brutality.
Later, I caught the stand of the baby
e we cross the border
with the children.
The nazista propaganda
it filmed them until a exhaustion
for Atualidades of the Cinema
during July and August.
The plan of Hitler was to make
to disappear the Poland of the map.
But this could mean war
with the Soviet Union
e it was not ready for this.
The Minister of the Foreign affairses
Ribbentrop flied for Moscow,
in 23 of August, to sign
the pact full brother-Soviet.
The destination of the Poland was stamped.
The new alliance haunted
the Ocidente surpreso.
Germany was rejoiced.
The conclusion of the pact reached
strong the politics of the isolation.
The Minister of the Businesses
Foreigners, Lord Halifax, explained:
They must have read the reports on
agreement between Russia and Germany,
that it surprised the world.
As the life of all the nations
it depends, in last analysis,
of the mutual respect of the rights,
e of the confidence of that each one
its life can live as wants,
I really wait.
This exactly, Lord Halifax.
The German people also
he wants to live the life to its way!
. that it cannot be portraied,
the reason can still prevail.
The Atualidades German had tried
to show distracted Great-Britain,
still without certezas.
The first-minister Chamberlain
Downing Street leaves.
The English diplomacy
it developed frantic efforts
to perpetuate the injustice.
A young German left England
for its country.
I had namorada
with who he wanted to marry
e said:
"I go to risk to go me it for house."
When I arrived the Colony,
I read first periodicals German
e knew soon
that it had a great danger
of a war.
The tone of the German press
he was completely histérico
e I thought that he was a crazy one.
It had come to house
at that moment.
For all the Europe, the soldiers
in the reserve they had received a telegram.
In the last hours of peace,
the soldiers had dressed the uniforms
with a tired smile.
