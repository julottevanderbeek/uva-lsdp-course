- Woman: Let me understand this.
-
I paid you the kind of
money that usually buys loyalty.
Instead, you and your
two hooligan buddies
sneak onto my property in
the middle of the night...
...and make off with
the kind of information
that's best kept between us...
Information that can
be easily misunderstood
by the ill-informed.
Well, at least your men escaped.
Killing four of my guys doing it.
But you, you're either too
slow or too stupid, so here you are,
taking the beating that
three men ought to take.
Oh, lady, you're
about as crazy as hell.
You are messing with
the wrong Southern woman.
I'll ask you one last time. Your men...
Where did they run off to with my shit?
You kiss your horses with that mouth?
I had some fellas swing by your place
to see if we could get
your daughter, Kathleen,
involved in all this.
There was no sign of her.
But imagine my delight in finding out
that you are the proud owner
of possibly the world's last
working answering machine.
I don't know where you are
or if you'll even get this,
Please, if you hear this,
meet me at the border gas station
outside of Jonesboro,
Arkansas, at 2:00 tomorrow.
- Aah!
-
-
-
Get him out of here.
-  -
--  --
Woman: He's requested
additional reinforcements
up in the northwest territory.
Man: All right, let me get on it.
I prefer the gray.
If the last presidential
power I got is the choice
over what I wear, I'm
wearing the brown suit.
The speech this afternoon...
Have you gotten a chance to go over it?
Oh, I've been over it.
This is basically a
national self-destruct order.
What's my legacy gonna be?
The overnight
President who killed America?
The virus killed America, Howard.
You're saving what's left.
- Oh!
-
You okay, Miss Shaw?
It's fine.
Woman: By next time's briefing.
Let's say probably
tomorrow morning, 0800.
- Man: All right, sounds...
-
Read the speech today word for word
and I guarantee there
will be a place for you
in the new world.
And an even better place for
you in the new economy.
If I don't?
Wear the gray suit, Howard.
My men saw at least one
Chinese Destroyer headed for Honshu.
I believe they intend to
make their landing in Tokyo.
What kind of resistance will there be?
- The population...
- Was wiped out.
But Peng is not
interested in the people.
He is heading here.
The Japanese National Archives.
Documents, records.
Historical materials important
to my people.
It wasn't enough to
kill the Japanese people.
He wants to erase my culture.
So we continue at EMCON,
set Deceptive Lighting,
and take the ship to Quiet One.
Agreed. He has two
destroyers left at his command.
I want to see them before they see us.
His navy sinks today.
Try it again.
-
-
-
-
Authorities meanwhile
continue to urge residents to consider
voluntary relocation, arguing
that concentrated...
You hearing this? ...population
into city centers would create
a better
infrastructure for most Americans,
many of whom face ongoing
food shortages.
President Oliver is set to deliver
a late-breaking speech
to the nation today imploring
all Americans...
We got to get you cleaned
up. You need to go on the air.
- What?
-
I can't go on the air.
The President's giving
speeches, rolling everything back.
He's setting the stage
for the regional leaders.
We have to counter the message.
And you're the only one who can do it.
They played me.
Price, Castillo, all of them.
I was tearing down Michener
while they were plotting his murder.
You couldn't have known.
You knew.
There's still time, Jacob.
We'll make it right.
This friend of yours... He's
been MIA this whole time.
You sure he's reliable?
He'll be at the gas station.
And right now, he's the
only person we can trust.
All right, Country Jesus.
It's chow time.
He's gone! Vanished! Killed
Doug with his own knife,
took his keys, his gun, one
of them trucks out back!
He's probably halfway
to Mexicali right now.
Calm down, Renfro.
We know exactly where he's going.

CNO on the bridge!
Sir, we picked up the
first Chinese Destroyer
on passive radar.
It's just over the horizon from us.
The bearing line ends at Tokyo Bay
and based on the path of
their navigational radar,
it appears to be doing patrol runs.
And Peng's second ship?
No sign of it, sir.
Probably at EMCON. Or
out looking for us.
The first ship's behavior is
consistent with High
Value Unit Defense posture.
Well, that confirms it.
If they're covering a High Value Unit,
that means Peng is there himself.
That ship is protecting him.
Peng's the kind of man that's
going to want to be there
to watch that art burn.
If the ship in the bay
is monitoring the area
outside the Archives and we
send a ground team after Peng...
His people spot us, ship
fires on the ground team.
But if we fire on the
ship without knowing
where the second destroyer
is, we give away our position.
And the second ship sinks us.
Doesn't leave us many
options for an approach.
It's a smart play by Peng.
Our target is the Japanese Archives
currently under the
protection of the Henan,
which is patrolling three
klicks off shore.
The mission to capture
Peng is a 2-pronged assault.
Cobra Team will take the
Chinese Destroyer Henan
at Tokyo Bay, cripple its
CIC, enabling Vulture Team,
led by CNO to storm Peng inside
the National Archives.
We estimate Henan's ordnance covers
a Weapons Engagement Zone
around the Archives of 80-plus miles.
However, they'll likely focus
their attention and their fire
on the area surrounding the
Archives building itself.
We'll call this the Hot Zone.
Now if Vulture Team is
detected approaching the Archives
from anywhere inside that Hot Zone
and we haven't taken Henan's CIC,
that ship fires on Vulture Team.
From our monitoring, we
know that Henan checks in
with Peng's ground forces
once every 15 minutes without fail.
Cobra Team will dive and
board Henan when it's D.I.W.
at the end of its patrol run in the bay.
Ship will be drifting toward us,
so that'll just shorten
our swim. Master Chief?
Henan is a Luyang III class
guided missile
destroyer similar to our...
Ripped off.
Ripped off from our Arleigh Burke.
Everyone will study the layout.
We need to know every blind
alley on that ship.
Surgical strike on the pilot house, CIC,
and armory will give us
complete control over that vessel.
This goes as planned,
the rest of their crew
won't even know we're there.
Make no mistake, we're
going after a target
who's clearly anticipating us
and who has a second
destroyer we cannot find.
Just one part of this
mission fails, it all fails.
That is all.
Sir.
There is one thing about this
plan that I will not be able to
explain to my people.
How I'm standing around doing nothing
while you guys are risking your lives.
I'd like to help in whatever way I can.
Well, you'll lead things
down here while Commander Garnett
runs the ship upstairs.
Thank you, sir.
Where are we?
Is Gene Hackman the
sheriff of this place?
It's the only pit stop for 100 miles.
Kind of a landmark.
Here.
Try not to look like a nervous wreck.
Miss Green?
Tex sent me.
I'm to bring you and the reporter
back to home base. Come
on. You'll be safe.
I never said anything about a reporter.
-
-
Desk work's making you soft.
You're late. And you
smell like horse shit.
Good to see you, too, sweetheart.
Tex Nolan.
How you doing?
- Thanks, hon.
- Hey, Dad! That's mine.
Is that where you've
been this whole time?
Working with Roberta Price?
Well, I wouldn't say
"working" with Price.
Me and the guys went
to help for a spell.
She had some trouble
in her region. Riots.
Right.
Said the Army's hands were tied,
could I train some fellas
to defend their homes?
Only the number of fellas
kept getting bigger and bigger
and they weren't for
security, they were enforcers.
- Enforcers?
- Mm-hmm.
For what?
Regional leaders are
building lots of walls.
They want 'em
protected with extreme prejudice.
He got it.
Dennis used a back door
into Shaw's work computer.
He forwarded me the President's speech.
"In the absence of a legislative branch
and without an operational
central government,
I have decided to exercise
my executive powers
and hereby suspend the government
of the United States, effectively
immediately."
Oh. Jesus.
Oliver is dissolving the country.
It doesn't sound like Oliver.
I may be wrong about him.
But either way, Oliver
cannot give that speech.
- Well... hang on to your asses.
-
We're going back to St. Louis.
Let's go.
Double-check that caliber max
is clear. Check your scope.
It's all good on magazine sweeps.
- Let's tighten these down.
-
Careful of those tracer
rounds. Woman: You're set.
Balance it out, okay? Double-check
your sights.
Hey, double check your gear.
The COM check? Good to go.
He's taking the 50.
Locked and loaded.
Captain...
Check your scopes. Double
strap it in. It's all in.
It's ready to go.
Keep your head down.
On a swivel.
All right, turn to, turn
to, wheel's up in 5 mikes.
Let's go. Let's do this.
CIC, Bridge.
Vulture Team has ETA of 1.0 minutes
to Archives perimeter.
Stand by for alert on
a 15-minute countdown.
_
_
_
Mother, this is NOMAD.
Divers in the water.
This is Vulture Team. I
have visual on the Archives.
We're at the edge of the Hot Zone.
Guards. Three at the
door, four walking the grounds.
We move through that
field, they'll spot us.
We wait for Cobra Team to take CIC.
-
-
- No talking.
- Hands! Let me see those hands!
Move.
Hands. Get 'em up! Hands!
Henan CIC secure.
Vulture Team, you are free to engage.
Roger that, Cobra Team.
Kill the lights.
_
_
Right flank moving forward.
-
- Aah!
_
It's the captain of the second ship.
Man:
He's asking why Henan
isn't responding to land teams.
Nathan James, Destroyer
Two is transmitting.
Do you see it?
Just a bearing, sir.
He says if Henan doesn't
respond immediately,
he'll assume the ship's
been boarded and fire on us.
He's bluffing.
No. We will kill our own to save Peng.
Those are his orders.
I assure you, we will be fired on.
_
_
What the hell's he saying?
He's preparing the crew to be martyrs.
Oh.
I say again, the second ship
is ordering us to fire on land
or they will fire on us.
Bridge, Combat. We
need to go Active Radar.
It's the only way to
see the second ship.
Negative. If they're
behind island cover,
we'd be giving away our
position for nothing.
But if we do, we could target and kill.
Commander, it's the only viable option.
Hey!
We just fired on Vulture Team.
Vulture Team, missiles incoming.
I say again, missiles incoming.
Three missiles fired from Henan.
They'll be on Vulture
Team inside one minute.
Go active.
T.A.O., get a lock on
those birds and fire at will.
T.A.O., aye, FIS is Green.
MSS kill tracks 5-0-2-8-1.
MSS, aye, kill tracks
Negative, sir. Sir,
lining sites, use all guns.
Scanning both green and blue grids, sir.
Bring MK-41 online.
- Direct hit.
-
All missiles destroyed.
Nathan James, this is Vulture Team.
Thank you!
Now watch your ass.
Distance, 10 mikes and closing.
We're being hit by Fire Control.
Fire Control on the second destroyer
just locked onto us.
Prepare countermeasures,
begin evasive maneuvers.
Hard right rudder, all ahead flank!
Right rudder, ahead flank, aye.
They're targeting the James.
Prepare to engage all incoming tracks.
I need targeting solutions
on that second destroyer.
Negative, sir, we do not hold radar.
Sir, the second Chinese
Destroyer's gone.
Man: No errors, ma'am. All clear, sir.
It's the same in every language.
All right, let's finish this!
Uhh!
Let's go. We got to keep moving.
Gallery's clear.
Corridor clear.
Uhh! Uhh!
_
-
- Uhh!
-
- Uhh!
-
-
On me!
You look unwell, Takehaya.
The cure not working for you?
You don't have much time left.
More time than you.
-
-
Like your people, you
are proud, but weak.
And like your people,
you will be erased from
the face of this earth.
Forgotten forever.
- Uhh!
-
-
-
But you will go to hell.
Who were you working with in America?
Why do you bother to fight
when everyone back
home has betrayed you?
They sent you here to die and
kill your friend Michener.
Who? Tell me!
You are all alone.
You have no one to trust.
-
- Uhh!
The nation is ready
for you, Mr. President.
I understand your
partners will be in the audience,
here to witness the
dismantling of the United States.
Remember, word for word,
or the next time America
hears about Howard Oliver,
it will be to commemorate his passing.
Peng's only destroyer now belongs to me.
You should know Cobra Team
found a payload of
anti-cure missiles on board.
According to the
crew, that's the last of it.
So... it is done.
The rest of Asia won't suffer as we did.
Let's get you home.
I am home, Captain Chandler.
I want to remain
here...
On Japanese soil.
Takehaya.
Kaito.
My name is Kaito.
Like my son.
Captain...
Fellow citizens of this great nation.
I speak to you today from
an unforeseen point
in human history.
In all of their brilliance,
our Founding Founders could
not have imagined a day
when a single virus would wipe out
countrymen, but of our species.
Here, take these. The speech's started.
The President's speaking from the lawn.
It's full of security guards out there.
How are you guys going to get to him?
He'll come to us.
You ready?
Yeah.
Good.
You two go with Barnes. Make
sure you keep him covered.
You should get out of here.
- What? No way.
- Dennis, I'm serious.
Get as far away from here as possible.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- For everything.
-
Today, the idealism of democracy
is at odds with the
practice of government
for and by the people.
Democracy, my fellow
Americans, is untenable.
In short, the center cannot hold.
It is therefore my
duty to inform you that,
with the advice... and consent of the...
regional leaders...
today, we set a new
course for the country.
In the absence of a...
legislative branch,
and without an operational
central government,
I have decided to
exercise my executive powers...
Shame on you, Mr. President!
You don't have to do
this, sir. This isn't you.
Get him out of here.
The Howard Oliver that
we know saved St. Louis.
Under your leadership, there
was no panic, no riots.
Even when there were 5,000
people dying a day,
you kept us together.
What happened to that man, sir?!
The President will not be
taking any questions today.
Thank you very much.
The hell I won't! Listen,
Jacob, you're right.
For a moment, I forgot
who I was, but not anymore!
-
- I know who I am!
Due to the security breach,
I'm sorry, everyone, we
will reconvene tomorrow.
Thank you for your
time. Thank you very much.
Miss Shaw, where are they taking him?!
Take your goddamn hands off me!
Sir, it's me. It's Kara. I can help you.
This way. You saved my life.
Not yet, we haven't.
Where are they taking him?!
Is the President a
prisoner in the White House?!
Miss Shaw!
- Let's go, right now.
-
-
- Uhh!
-
- We got a shooter!
-
- Uhh!
Hot damn, son.
-
- This is Allison Shaw.
We have two shooters escaping
from the East Wing with POTUS.
We got to go back for Jacob.
Let me go! Let me go!
You run back in there,
you don't come back! Jac...
It's about the President.
-
- Uhh!
- Uhh!
-
Go!
Let go of me!
Don't let the vehicle get out!
-
-
Lock the gates! Move!
Drive, Kara, drive!
Thought I'd be the one to tell you.
The Cobra Team found
coordinates of Henan CIC.
You were right.
The Chinese knew where
Hayward and Shackleton were gonna be.
Seems someone in St. Louis
wants the U.S. Navy out
of the way, Captain.
There's still some
good people back home.
Generals, captains, operators.
I know a few myself.
Well, let's get 'em on the line.
We need all the help we can muster.
-
-
Captain...
Kyoko wants to thank
you for all that you've done
for her family and for
Japan. She wishes you well.
Man: You gonna unhook this vest?
She wants to die with her
husband on her own soil.
Her people will take care of the baby.
I'm fueled up and ready
to go. Jesse, thank you.
You saved a lot of lives. You're
gonna save a lot more.
Just get home in one piece.
Take care of yourself.
Man: I'll have the
final numbers ASAP, sir.
Man: No, he's on the hangar deck.
Woman: I'll find him. Stand by.
Man: Is that the last
of it off the RHIB?
- Careful with that.
- Man: Aye, sir. I'm on it.
Naval Station San Diego.
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.
I say again, Naval Station San Diego.
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.
Sir, there's something you need to see.
The strains of
reconstruction have proven too great to bear
and have given rise to forces hellbent
on creating chaos.
agitators breached our
walls and tried to take control
have guarded the truth for
the safety of the public.
Now it's time you, the
American people, learn the facts.
President Jeffery Michener
did not take his own life.
He was murdered, along
with Senator Beatty
and Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, Rivera.
The terrorist were working
with certain members of the media
and with agents
inside the government itself,
but until today, we didn't
know how high it went.
He orchestrated the
deaths of Jeffrey Michener
and those loyal to him so
that he could take office
Son of a bitch.
Don't do this. Don't do this.
- Please, don't do this! Don't do...
-
But that is not all.
We have just learned that this
cabal was also responsible
for the kidnapping of the
crew of Nathan James in Asia.
This was done with the cooperation
and planning of Captain Tom Chandler.
In fact, I struggle
to believe it's true.
But we have indisputable
evidence of his treachery.
Captain Chandler is
currently under arrest
and is heading back to North America.
These are
not easy words for me to say.
Oh, my God. She's
putting all this on you.
-
- Nobody'll buy it.
The greater the lie, the
more people will believe it.
We are strong people, and we
have survived worse than this.
and the pursuit of
happiness have come together
So in the absence of any working
federal government,
your regional leaders,
Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft
Each region will be
able to govern itself
Yeah. In other words, never.
control of the Armed
Forces will have been split
that the military
turnover has been peaceful,
between the nation's highest-ranking
generals
All enlisted men and
women are to report to
regional military offices
immediately to become part...
Of one of four localized
armies under the command...
Captain, I can't get the
generals on the line...
Any of them.
I tried to raise an entire Naval base.
It's a coup, Captain.
Those men are already dead.
If there's no military, what
does that mean for us?
It means we're all alone.
We lost our country, Tom.
Not yet.
Captain, set a course for
Naval Base San Diego, helpful.
Take us home.
