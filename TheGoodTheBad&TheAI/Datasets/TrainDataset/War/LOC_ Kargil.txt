Sir
Lieutenant Kaalia, carry out detailed
survey with this patrol
News is that a few rats have crossed
over into our territory from the LOC
lf you notice any suspicious activity,
get in touch with me immediately...
and pass me the information
Not to worry, sir. We'll crush the rats
and push them back across the LOC
Good. All the best
Thank you, sir
Lieutenant Kaalia, come in.
Over
Lieutenant Kaalia, come in.
Over
Lieutenant Kaalia, this is your C.O
Lieutenant Kaalia, come in.
Over
Amit, do you here me?
Amit... Over
Get me Brigade headquarter
Alfa to Tiger come in... over
Sir, l've a problem. Not been able
to establish radio contacts with...
both my patrols for last two weeks
There is absolutely no news of them.
This is the cause of worry, sir
Now you do one thing Colonel.
Wait for my further order
And please don't send anymore
search parties
Let me talk to higher command.
And l'll get back to you
Over and out.
- Over
What happened?
- lt was an ambush, sir
lt was so dark,
couldn't tell where the enemy was...
The Mujahidins and the Pakistani troops
have crossed the LOC...
and intruded several kilometers
into our territory
From this information, it looks like
they're all over the place
The Muskoh valley, the Dras sector
and the Batalik sector
They've taken over
the whole lndian territory
And they have occupied
our bunkers too
The rations our troops had
left behind in the bunkers...
is what they're feeding off
to attack us!
The problem is that they're watching
the National Highway number one...
through point 4875,
Tololing and Kukarthang...
and continuously shelling
our convoys
Situation is very serious.
Connect me to Delhi
Right, sir
Sir, the enemy plan is simple.
To cut of Kashmir from Ladak...
by hitting
national highway number one
Orders from Delhi are very clear
The maximum mobilization
must take place in the Kargil sector
Orders are to press maximum number
of battalions into service
And as we know, with the enemy sitting
up there at an advantageous position...
requiring us to attack them
from down below...
So the ratio will be 6:1
We'll lose six, They'll lose one
And Kargil terrain is such,
where the ratio will be 10:1
And that the reason why
maximum mobilization is taking place
Sir, let us cross the LOC and cut off
the enemy from behind
So that we lose less lives
We'll get into Pakistani territory
and cut off all their lines of supply
No Brigadier.
The orders are very clear
That we'll be going by the book
At no point of time, we'll cross
the line of control
These are the clear instruction
from Delhi
And so, let's move
But the 1/11 Gurkha Regiment has
just returned from Siachen, sir
Can't help it. They are
the best fighters for this area
Colonel Lalit Rai will take command
of the 1/11 GR
Let me talk to him
Colonel Lalit.
- Sir?
You are required to proceed to
Yaldor Kargil sector immediately
And take charge of 1/11 Gurkha Regiment.
- Yes, sir
We'll make arrangements to drop you
at Yaldor within 24 hours
l'll be there, sir
Jai Hind, sir
& 470 other ranks at your command, sir!
Battalion ! Don't move!
Sir! 3 officers, 27 JCOs and 470
other ranks at your command!
Okay
Battalion ! At ease!
Praised be Goddess Kali!
Here come the Gurkhas!
The Gurkha regiment
is known for its bravery!
My brave friends, battle and
bloodshed aren't unknown to us
We saw Kashmir
bathed in blood recently!
The Gurkha regiment is famous
all over the world
Even Hitler had once said...
''lf l can have the Gurkha troops...''
''l can conquer the entire world''
And, as your Commanding Officer...
Lalit Rai wants to see you
victorious in Kargil!
Any doubts...?
None, sir!
Praised be Goddess Kali!
Here come the Gurkhas!
Battalion mount
Message from the Command, sir
Colonel Thakur, move your Battalion
immediately
Stop all operation in Kashmir valley
and proceed immediately
Right, sir
Run, Suleman ! Run !
Let go! Let go!
You've had a narrow escape
Had you got into it,
you'd have been taken too
Scared, aren't you?
He was armed to his teeth.
He could've killed you
And l'm a Maratha... a real man
We don't get scared.
We give others a scare
And l'm a Jat from Haryana.
l only hit out
That's the problem with you
Pig-headed guys.
You won't ever use your brains
Hail Maharashtra
Hail Haryana
Sachin... stop fighting, guys
Word is that all the operations
in the valley have been called off
And Battalion is moving
forward to Dras sector
Come on
Relax
Soldiers, l have received orders
The Tololing glacier, which is our
territory and on which we have a post...
has been captured by the enemy.
From there....
the enemy is keeping a watch on
National Highway number one
They are monitoring every move
our convoys are making...
and keeping an eagle's eye
on their activities
lt's very necessary for us
to eject the enemy from there
We've got to launch
an attack on them
They sent a couple of battalions
up there
The 16 Grenadiers are presently
engaged in combat over there
The task is now being
entrusted to us...
and Head Quarters
wants us to accept it
As if there are only a dozen
Jihadis sitting out there!
The Naga battalion has
already got there, sir
Something is surely fishy, sir.
Nobody's telling us the whole truth
lf we are issued orders, we'll
definitely launch an offensive, sir
But the enemy's at such a height,
every grenade they hurl at us...
will come down at lightning speed, sir.
Besides, we have no information
about the enemy, sir
Are they 8 in number or 800 ?
Even if there are
they've gotten into our house!
And we'll surely throw them out sir!
Easier said than done!
lf we're a family,
you're like the father among us
So why are you thrusting us
to the path of cowardice?
And that too, blindfolded!
When a child walks through
a dark alley...
he sings and whistles,
out of fright
We'll go out singing too, sir
The same old song
my mother keeps humming
''So lover boy...''
''tell me the truth...
what's going to happen?''
Sir...wrong grammar sir.
Are you here to win the war
or correct my language...?
Sir, let us have your orders.
The battalion is ready
Eighteen Brigadiers...
The mighty heroes!
The mighty heroes!
Colonel Baba, listen...
move your Battalion 17 Jat
to Kargil sector immediately
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind
Relax Anuj. Sit down.
Catch your breath
Thank you, sir
Where did you steal the ice?
What else can one steal here?
lt's either the splendour of nature
or the chill of ice
Never said the true word
Now tell me...
what happened in the mission?
There were four of them, sir.
All Afghan tribals
Three of them used the cover of women
and children to escape...
but l nabbed the fourth one
You must have interrogated him then?
- l did, sir
But he kept crying
and saying just one thing
''For God's sake, shoot me''
- Why?
He said that if he lived, people of
his militant group would kill him
But if he died, his wife and kids
would be paid 300,000 rupees
So it was,
''Shoot me, for God's sake''
l asked him
who would pay them the money...?
and he said, the militant group
Sir, the mujahidins of Afghanistan have
got as far as the Pir Punjab, sir
A lot of movement is being observed
in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, sir
We must inform Brigade headquarter.
- That we'll do, Anuj
The Battalion is moving to Mathai.
Kargil sector
Kargil? Trouble area?
You'll have a lot of chances
to catch terrorists today...
and we'll get to squeeze the trigger
Of course, Anuj.
Let's go
Jai Hind, sir
Deepak, you still had some
leave to go, didn't you?
l had leave, all right sir
But l alone know
how l've spent it
What happened?
The coffin of a soldier arrived kept
arriving in the village every other day
They were mostly from
the Sikh Battalion, sir
Deepak, our Battalion is headed to
where these coffins are coming from
lt's to avenge those coffins that
l've returned before time, sir
Deepak sir... the enemy will
now lie in coffins
Let's hope so
Major Joshi. Joe.
- Yes, sir
You have been promoted
as Lieutenant Colonel
Thank you, sir.
l hope l deserve it, sir
You take command of
l go to be the commanding officer
of Battalion, sir
That's right.
- Right, sir
Things here at Kargil are pretty bad
Now your task, move to Kumri,
Kargil sector
Right, sir.
Thank you, sir
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind
Ajay, all the operations in the valley
have been cancelled
The battalion's moving towards
the Dras sector
Where's Vikram Batra?
- He had gone with the patrol party
We had information that some
terrorists were holed up...
in a village five kilometers from here.
He had gone after them
When did he go?
- Four days ago
Four days...?
What the hell!
Did you try to contact him?
- Of course, Vikas...
l sent a patrol party. But by the time
they got there, he had already left
to get in touch with us
l hope the patrol party is okay!
Their security is our responsibility
Let's get him on the radio
We've reached base-camp...
Message over
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings
Sir, Vikram-saab has arrived!
Hey Superman...!
Thank God you're okay
Where the hell were you?
- Where...? Here l am
Vicky! We were all so worried
Know what?
Major Vikas is fuming inside
Where did you slip away?
- lt's the terrorists who slipped away
The places l looked for them!
Dimwit! People run away from trouble...
and you go looking for it!
lt's a man's calling to face trouble,
not to run away from it
You are crazy
What's all the preparation for?
Where's the battalion going?
Kargil. Dras sector.
There's said to be some problem there
That's nice. l won't have to go
hunting for it anymore
l'll go and report.
- Okay
Relax
Enough, enough...
Thanks a lot
How are you doing, Ramesh Kumar-ji?
- l'm okay
Greetings!
Greetings!
Sanjay, you've returned
early this time?
Yes, l went to your house too
Your wife sent some laddoos.
Will give them to you later
You asked about my mother?
- She's all right
Welcome, Sanjay...
- How are you?
So your mother finally
put shackles in your feet?
Oh yes, she found a bride
for me this time
So... what else is happening?
What else? Major Joshi is here too
The Major has returned?
You mean, he has returned from the
advanced-post in Shahjahanpur?
l got a feeling from the news on radio
that this is serious business
Sit down.
- Sir
All ready?
- Raring to go, sir
Good
Our information is that there's just
a handful of jihadis holed up there...
so why move the whole battalion?
Whether this is minor trouble or major,
we'll know only when we get there
Sir, when do we move?
We have to reach Kumri in 48 hours.
- We'll be ready, sir
Let's move
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings
Relax
Sanjay, you returned early
from your vacations?
Yes, sir. As soon as l got to know that
the battalion is marching forward...
l came away immediately
Raghunath...
- Yes, sir?
Any letter from home?
How's your mother keeping?
She's all right, sir
Soldiers! My friends...
when l was a child, we used to live
in a mansion outside the village
Whenever we had a guest,
we extended our hospitality to him
Even when someone came
uninvited...
we still treated him to food
and sent him away
When an animal strayed
into our colony...
we drove it away with a stick
But whenever a cheetah
or a wolf came preying...
we always shot it dead
Something similar has happened
in our house today
A pack of wolves
have got into our house
You tell me...
how are they to be treated?
Kill them!
That's what we're going to do.
So give me your word
That we will not return,
until we have accomplished our task
Are you firm in your resolve?
- Yes, we are firm in our resolve!
''Brother dear, this is an
amazing thing to happen''
''The laddie is playing bridegroom''
''He leads the
bridal procession...''
''sending a shiver down
every spine''
So bridegroom... you're here?
- You... are the limit!
This is the first time you're meeting me
after your marriage
So how was it?
- What?
The marriage! What else?
lt was the way it was supposed to be
Mom found a bride for me
and l got married, that's it
How's the bride?
Nice
Beautiful?
Now, beauty lies in the eyes
of the beholder...
So she's beautiful!
You've brought a picture?
Yes
Where is it?
ln my heart
How about her memories?
- They're in my heart too
So what have you
brought for me, buddy?
Sweetmeats.
- Where is it?
ln the hold-all. Help yourself
Very good. l thought you'd say
it's all in the tummy!
Now come to the point
So soldier Yogendra Singh Yadav...
- Well?
How did the nuptial night go?
- Forget it...
Tell me!
Fantastic!
You...
Jerk! You were the one who got married
and l got almost killed
How come?
You're Yogendra Singh Yadav.
So am l
You belong to the 18 Grenadiers,
so do l
l got a congratulatory note
for the wedding
l'm glad it came here to me.
Had it fallen in my wife's hands...
she'd have cried,
''My husband has got married again !''
She'd have left for this place
with a stick...
and poor me would have taken
all God gave me!
You'd have got a nice beating
from your wife!
The nuptials were okay, you know.
ln fact, it was all very nice
But when l woke up early in the morning,
l had a terrible nightmare
What?
l saw some people trying to snatch
the national Tricolour from my hands
But Yadav-boy... l just wouldn't
let go of the flag
l thrashed them all on my own
and drove them away...
Your dreams are as black
as your tongue!
Your dream has come true
Not you alone, we're all going together
to save the Tricolour
Do what you will.
- What's to be done...? What?
We'll thrash them with this very flag
and shove them across the border
We'll send them back to
where they came from!
We've seen the peacock dance
We've seen the heaviest of fogs
And now the drains tell the sea...
learn to rage!
We've seen what noise
the showers can make!
''Brother dear, this is an
amazing thing to happen''
''The laddie is playing the bridegroom''
Shut up, will you...? Shut up!
l hear there's a lot of tension there.
- Maybe God has given me an opportunity
To sacrifice my life in order
to protect my friends...
Don't you dare heap curse
on my beloved...
that too, before we are married.
- Okay, okay...
l'll never say such a thing again.
l'll come back and marry you
You and l will then talk about
giving birth to babies... okay?
Go away!
Where's the battalion?
- My battalion has left for Kargil
l'm told there are signs
of an impending war there
l'm a soldier, after all
And only the fortunate soldiers
get to see action on the battlefield
Whenever you talk about battle...
my heart begins to sink
Don't you dare, Mrs Yadav...
you will not shed a single tear
l want to carry memories
of your smiling face with me
Smile now...
Go on... smile...
Yogesh...
you thought you could go away
just like that?
l thought you were asleep
l knew you'd be leaving
early in the morning...
so l couldn't go to sleep all night.
l heard everything
You got up, went to the bathroom...
took a shower, dressed and were
about to sneak out like a thief
l didn't want to disturb anyone
lf Eshita had woken up,
she wouldn't have let me leave
But you'd still have gone away.
To your other family
l have just one family.
The soldiers in my battalion...
you and Eshita.
- And whose support do l have?
You have a protector.
The one in the temple... Lord Krishna
As if He won't protect
your battalion !
Why not? He always chooses a medium
to do what He wants to do
And l think, l'm the one
He has chosen
All right... but do take care
of yourself
Don't worry.
Nothing can happen to me
l won't let it either!
Even if death comes calling...
l'll confront it
Really...? How?
Like this!
Papa...
come back soon. Okay?
Hey Sanjay...
why the long face?
Aunt, my battalion
has left Sopore...
for Kargil.
l've got to leave too
No, son. Your uncle died
in the war of '65...
and now you...?
lf something happens to you,
it'll be the end of this family
Mine is a huge family, Mother
The entire lndian army
is guarding it
lf not now, when again will l
go to defend my motherland?
Give me your blessings.
And see me off with a smile, okay?
All right, son
Oh, you...?
Santo...
Wait, Santo
Listen... listen...
l've heard everything
And so the coward
adorns her eyes with tears already?
All right, l'm a coward.
Not someone brave like you...
to send you to face the gun
with a smile
Nothing will happen to me, silly
Your love is a shield
l'm wearing
You're trying to humour me...?
- No
l promise, l will return
lf not for anyone else...
it'll be only for you
Do come. lf something happens to you,
the world will call me a witch...
who swallowed her fiance
You're so worried about
the world, aren't you?
My world begins and ends with you
This time l'm serious.
Serious about you
l swear
Look in my eyes and tell me
lf you think l'm lying,
you may go away
What do you plan to do in life?
- Join the army
Why army?
Because a soldier lives by chance,
loves by choice...
and kills by profession
l'm very impressed, Mr Vikram Batra
You know, Mitthu? An officer has to
spend most of his time on the borders
Will you be able to live with that?
Don't you think
you are moving too fast?
l want this relationship to be more
than a mere friendship
l want to give our friendship a name...
will you be able to live with it?
Now you look in my eyes and tell me...
what do they say?
Mr Anuj Nayyar.
- Excuse me. Lieutenant Anuj Nayyar
l'm sorry.
- Yeah ! You better be sorry
Never call me mister, okay?
- Hey!
You're already fighting with me!
What will happen in the future?
What? lf it comes to the worst, we'll
have a bad anniversary photograph
Excuse me.
Are you proposing to me?
l don't know.
l'm l?
Well yeah, l suppose l am
So, yes or no?
Lieutenant Anuj Nayyar,
you are an officer
Behave like one
Get down on your knees
and ask for the lady's hand
Yes, ma'am
Will you marry me, please?
Yes l will
Show me where the burn is
Forget it, Mother. lt's nothing.
- Show it to me...
Good God! Want me to apply
some cream on it, son?
Mother, your son's joining the army
where huge bombs are going to explode
Will you come to kiss his hand there?
When you say such things,
l feel very scared, son
Mother...
Here comes my support.
Our neighbour!
My child, l could've made some tea
for you, if you had come a bit earlier
Look at him...
he has burnt his hand
Where?
- Lay off!
Ever so eager to hold my hand.
- Show it to her
No, Mother.
l'll have to wait to take his hand
What does that mean?
- He knows what l'm talking about
He won't let me do
anything for him
He makes the tea on his own.
He himself heats the water for a shave
He sews the buttons on his shirt
And he uses a brush to
string his pajamas
And if l'm not looking...
he will himself sit down
and wash his own clothes
Well? Why must you do
everything on your own?
Mother, you did everything for me
till l grew up
Now when l can do it on my own,
why must l make you do it?
General Manoj Pandey, some chores
are meant only for women
Absolutely right!
Bring home a daughter-in-law
lt'll make you happy and my
burden will be taken care of too
Where do you find such
daughters-in-law nowadays, mother?
We do. l've even found someone.
- Really?
l approve of her.
- Who's she?
Mother, don't utter one name please.
That's Hema
Else, it'll ruin your son's mood
l must leave now
Where to?
l've kept some lentils on the stove.
l'll wait till the broth is cooked!
lsn't she nice?
She's crazy!

Jai Hind, sir
There's shelling taking place ahead.
Please be careful, sir
Convey the message to the convoy.
Be on alert
There's shelling ahead...
Watch your step
Here you are, Manoj.
- Thank you, sir
What are you thinking about?
This can't be the work
of mere infiltrators, sir
To blow up an ammunition pile
and the TV tower with artillery...
the artillery fire's all coming from
the Pakistani's, isn't it sir?
Your guess is right, Manoj
But you must save your anger
and your strength for the enemy
l'm only angry with myself, sir
How did the enemy cross the LOC
and get in, in the first place?
There were a few bunkers
lying vacant on the LOC
Since the owners weren't around,
they seemed up for grabs
That's all right, sir.
Even if the milk isn't covered...
the dog must know where to stop
The motherf!@$%
Get out of these shelling area
There's shelling
on the National Highway, sir!
Motherf!@$%...
They're using heavy shelling
to welcome our forces!
Yadav, we had information
that they and some Mujah...
what do you call them...?
- Mujha... screw them!
The Mujahideen !
Looks like they want to wreck
the National Highway...
so they can isolate Ladakh and Kashmir
from the rest of the country!
l was told some rats
had got in
ls that the sound of the rats?
Balwan, maybe these rats
are going to bother us
Bombshells... bombshells
One after the other!
Glory to Krishna!
Glory to Mother lndia!
Sir, neither has anyone seen the enemy,
nor heard them
Who they are and in what numbers,
no one knows
All we see is a hail of bullets...
and hear the cries of
those who are dying
The injured soldier must've
told you something?
They don't even know whether the
ones up there are human or beasts...
dogs or wolves!
Dogs and wolves don't use
rocket-launchers and rifles, Anuj
These men must be the crazy jihadis
you have seen in the valley
The sort of firepower they are using
clearly suggests...
that the Pakistani forces
are giving them full support
This is a serious situation
Those firing from up there could be
just 4 in number or even four thousand
We are being thrust into a wreck
we know nothing about
When one is groping
in the darkness...
if not a torch, one must
at least have a candle, sir
Sharmaji, if you are so fond of asking
questions, why did you join the army?
You ought to have gone to Parliament
or another government assembly
l'm sorry, sir.
- lt's okay
Get the Bravo company ready,
for reiki
To understand the enemy, we must
learn the terrain
l need Anuj with me, sir
Sure, but after three days
of acclimatisation
Now if anyone of you have
any questions or doubts...
ask me right now.
After this no questions
Understand?
- Yes, sir
Sir, we will make contact with
the enemy in three days
We'll identify the enemy.
l promise you
Good luck
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings
Sir, my truck has run off the road.
l need help to get it out, sir
Let's go and see
C'mon boys, let's move
Which battalion are they from?
They're the dead bodies of
officers and soldiers...
from the Sikh Regiment
and the Grenadiers
We're taking them to Delhi
from Srinagar
Bodies. Truckloads of them
l swear it on the milk
my mother fed me...
l will avenge every death !
Right now l'm not thinking of revenge.
l'm thinking of their families...
in whose courtyard the bodies
of these martyrs will be laid
Looks like there's a lot of trouble
brewing in the Kargil sector, sir
Let's put the coffins inside
Our information said it was
about a hundred mujahideen
lt was wrong
The enemy strength is estimated to be
between 2000 to 3000 troops...
which has taken control right from
the Muskoh valley to the Batalik sector
Supported by Pakistan's fifth
Northern Light lnfantry
Take some men to the right.
- Right away, sir
Sir, looks like all the villagers have
run away because of Pakistani shelling
All clear, sir!
Relax.
Sit down, Manoj
Come. Sit
Manoj, we have established control
over the village Yaldor
Why don't we make this
our base-camp?
Brigadier Devendra Singh
has issued orders...
that a company of our Gurkha Regiment
will help the 3 Punjab Battalion...
and the 16 Grenadiers.
- Very well, sir
They haven't been able to make any
headway towards Kukarthang
Because of the enemy's
power of resistance
Enemy at Kukarthang is very powerful.
A man in fire power
Who could be better than you to battle
the enemy, Wrestler Pandey...?
l want you to take a company and
proceed towards Kukarthang
Very well, sir.
- ls that okay?
lt will be done
But l have a request.
Even if don't get any rations...
there should be no lack
of ammunitions, sir
l'll make sure of that
l want you to be fully prepared.
- Very well, sir
l will take a company and
proceed towards Jubaar
Tomorrow we'll move
at six hundred hours
Six hundred hours,
it will be, sir
Relax
l've asked you to relax
although l know...
that any relaxation for us in the coming
days is going to be extremely sinful
We have been entrusted a mission that
won't bring relaxation anywhere near us
Our target will be the Kukarthang Post
Soldiers of the 3 Punjab
and the 16 Grenadiers...
have been trying to capture the post
at Kukarthang for the past few days
But such is the fire and confidence
of the enemy...
that our soldiers haven't been able
to move further at all
We've got to rush to their help
l know it's not an easy job
But looking at the confidence, bravery
and history of the Gurkha regiment...
it doesn't seem difficult either.
Any doubts?
None, sir
We will carry enough ammunition,
but do also carry a lot of stretchers
Which means some of us
are not going to return, sir
Each and every one of us will return.
ln whatever state he is
That's Manoj Pandey's promise to you.
We will not leave behind a single friend
Any doubts?
- None, sir
Some lives will still be lost, sir
Yes, surely
Maybe you don't know.
Death is a bride...
that picks and chooses
the most handsome of grooms
Then l don't stand any chance, sir.
l'm not handsome at all!
That's what you think, Thapa
You must ask your mother
how good-looking you are
Sir, we've established contact
with 3 Punjab!
How far away are they?
- They appear to be close by, sir
Take positions! The enemy could
be trying to deceive us
Ask for the link-up code
Bravo one for Alfa one
Link of Gomti. Over
Bravo, this is Alfa.
ln Gomti's care... over
ls he saying in Gomti's care
or is it Gomti's banks...?
He said, ''care'', sir.
- All right
Give them our position and
summon them for a link-up
Bravo one for Alfa one.
Get difference. 43126... over
We can see them, sir
All clear
Everybody sit down in single file
What news?
- Bad news, sir
A patrol party of 3 Punjab
and 16 Grenadiers...
went towards Kukarthang.
And they never returned
We've been here for the
last 20 days, sir
Didn't you go in search
of your companions?
No, sir.
We had orders...
not to leave our post,
so that more lives would not be lost
We gained control of this position
with great difficulty
The brigade doesn't want the enemy
to take control of this position...
which will take them further.
- All right
The Gurkhas are here
to relieve you
We'll take this route up there.
- Not this route, sir
This is the route our patrolling party
took and they haven't come back
This is the route l will take
Hello Simran, listen...
Oh ! Sorry aunty
Will you give the phone
to Simran please?
Simran ! Oh, l'm glad
to hear your voice
That's the crazy lover
What luck, darling!
We found a telephone booth at the
foothill of the snow-capped mountains!
And wonder of wonders.
l found you at home too!
Why? Does she always
go wandering around...?
We're engaged. We'll now be married.
And then...?
Speak up! What's there
to be shy about?
l'll tell you
The marriage will take
place in Tololing
And the honeymoon's
happening in Tiger Hills
Fantastic, Jimmy.
Keep it up
lt's really very cold, Simran
But the warmth of your love
helps me battle the chill
Wow! ls that a new
brand of heater?
Excuse me
Do you know me?
Not really, but having heard you
speak on the telephone...
l've got to know a bit about you.
- And having heard your rubbish...
l've got to know how
insolent you are
What...?
- Yes
Hey Guys! Relax
Captain Sanjiv Jamwal,
Captain Anuj Nayyar.
This is Lieutenant Batra. My friend
Fun and jokes were born with him...
and maybe they'll leave with him
Don't mind him
Mr Batra, jokes are all right as long as
they don't hurt someone's feelings
lf l have hurt your feelings,
l apologise
Very sorry
That's like it.
- And by the way, it's Vicky
Anuj
Anuj. Where are you from?
- Delhi
And you?
- Palanpur
Beautiful place.
- Beautiful women
C'mon Yogendra... join the queue
Oh yes, you're newly married
At least have a word
with the poor girl
Tell me something... is it enough
that you just talk to her?
That only a married man
would be able to tell, sir
And you aren't even married yet
All l know is that my folks are waiting
for Balwan to visit them on vacation...
so that they can
handcuff him in marriage!
ln which case, the two of us are
sailing in the same boat, sir
You...?
- Excuse me, sir
l'm Sanjay Kumar from
the J & K Rifles
l couldn't resist myself
when l overheard your conversation
Balwan
Yogendra, 18 Grenadiers
Hello.
- Hello
The pining for that first union
with the beloved after marriage...
is unique in itself
''l must leave to unite
with my beloved''
He's turned a poet!
- Get married, sir
The worst of illiterates
turn poets
Praised be Krishna.
- Praised be Krishna, sir
What are you eating?
- Bread, sir
ls everything okay, Yogendra?
- Okay, sir
My Bengali friend...
- Yes?
Glory to Subhash Chandra Bose!
- How are you, Balwan?
Great. Very well!
- Good, good, good
What are you eating?
- Bread
Hey Sachin...
- What?
Glory to Shivaji Maharaj!
- Glory to him!
You've eaten...?
- Am eating... want some? C'mon
What are you doing, you clown !
- Clown...?
l took some bread from Bengal,
some from Maharashtra...
won't l take any from U.P. ?
Hasn't Balwan brought
anything to eat?
l have, sir... loads of it
But not to be eaten. To be fed
To be fed?
- Yes
l've brought bullets, sir.
l'll feed the Pakistanis
Don't tell me. You mean, you haven't
brought any food?
l carried a lot of slugs, sir
The Pakistanis are starving
for the bullets nowadays
Bravo! Well said
There was artillery firing here
Looks like this is where
the action took place
Watch out... there could be landmines!
- Watch out... for landmines
He's still clutching the rifle, sir
Even if life has deserted him...
the soldier still has his gun
He's been dead for many days.
He belonged to the 16 Grenadiers, sir
Which means the rest of the missing
patrol party must be somewhere around
To begin with, make arrangements
to take the bodies down
Get the stretcher...
Move quickly
Take cover! Take up positions!
l've been hit by a bullet, sir!
- Nothing will happen to you !
l've been hit, sir!
- You will be all right, Thapa!
We've contacted the company
behind us, sir!
Tell them that we need
immediate reinforcement!
Till then, we'll hold on to
our positions. Any doubt?
Hey dead-meat... you're here
to pick up the bodies...?
Go ahead, take them away.
You can roast them in fire!
You sisterf& ^%$% sonofabitch !
You love playing with fire,
don't you?
You're the one l'm going to roast
in the fires, you rotten motherf$#@ !
Stop firing!
lt's going to be dark soon.
Take cover behind the rocks
No one will open fire... Any doubts?
- No, sir!
Why've you stopped firing,
you dog?
Sir, our reinforcement has reached
Move as soon as the clouds
cover the moon
Lie still when the moon shows up
The enemy mustn't get to know
about our movement
Fire an illumination round
Shoot the dogs!
ET 456 fire
Praise be to Goddess Kali!
Here comes the Gurkha!
There could be mines ahead, sir!
Move on, in the name
of the Goddess Kali
Praise to Goddess Kali!
- Here comes the Gurkha!
Come on, swines!
Bheem Bahadur, take them on
from the left
Hail Goddess Kali!
Here comes the Gurkha!
Alfa to Gomti's care... over.
- Wait
The C.O.'s on the line, sir
Gomti's care to Alfa... over.
- Congratulations, Manoj
This is a great day. First victory
of operation Vijay. Over
Thank you, sir. Over.
- What's the matter, Manoj?
You don't seem to be happy. Over
lt's a great day for you, sir
But for me, it'll always be a day
when l lost my men
Today l lost nine
of my Gurkha brothers
And right now l'm sending
their corpses to their families
l hope you will understand
what l'm going through, sir
l was responsible for those soldiers
Manoj, when a soldier goes to war
he leaves his sentiments behind
Over
You are right, sir.
- Over and out
However, these bloody sentiments
sneak in, and break the heart
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind
Take your seats
Let me brief you gentlemen
Our primary aim...
is to capture point 4540
That will cut off all the roads
to Muskoh valley...
through which the
Pakistani infiltrators receive help
Our final objective, point 4875
This point is as important
as Tiger hill
That's the point from where we can
keep an eye on the entire Dras sector
Besides, to protect
our National Highway...
it is imperative that
we hold this point
Major Puniya.
- Yes, sir
You will attack point 4540
with the B company
Charlie Company
will remain in reserve
Major Deepak Rampal,
you three JCOs, seven jawans...
and Captain Anuj Nayyar...
and the two of you...
You will survey the heights...
between 5930 to 4830
Deepak, you always said that our job
is to hunt and destroy the enemy
To seek and destroy.
- Yes, sir
Well, this is your chance
Brigadier Kakad
has given us the go-ahead
Anuj, you wanted to
know the enemy, right?
Go on, introduce yourself
lntroduce the lndian Army to them
Good luck, boys
Anuj, you are trapped, sonny
You will be surrounded by Jhangus
all your life
My sister-in-law is
your to-be wife's best friend
And my brother is your batchmate
What will you do now?
- Who knows, sir...
whether the Jhangus will be
known as Nayyars or vice versa?
But the best part is,
when friends turn relatives...
it makes the journey of life
even more beautiful
You're dead right
Too wise for your age
But Anuj, be careful
Hope these Jhangus don't make you
live with them
Sir, for the sake of her love,
l'm willing to do that too
Take cover. Move
See something?
The enemy's mortar position, sir
How many men?
- As many as they need
May l say something?
- Yes
Looking at that Pakistani piss...
l too feel like doing it
Which means they will have to die
a little earlier for your sake?
Yeah !
When you got to go,
you got to go
Let's go then.
Let's go
Bloody...!
Bring first aid
Anuj
Alfa come in
Bravo this is Alfa.
Pass your message. Over
Sir, we captured
the mortar position
But unfortunately
we've lost two men, sir
Some wounded and some dead, sir
- Goddamit!
Anyway, you consolidate
your positions
Hang on in there.
And don't worry
l'll sending you reinforcement
to bring back the wounded and the dead
Over.
- Yes, sir
We'll check the position, sir
- Come back soon, Deepak
l'll be waiting for you. Over
Over and out.
- Over and out, sir
Everybody alert.
Looks like someone is coming
Could be the enemy
Take position
Our men. lt seems they are
bringing in casualties
Yadav-ji...
- Yes?
Our friends are in bad shape
Oh my God!
Nursing assistant
Give morphine shots to all of them
The enemy can't be seen.
We can't assess their strength either
lf they can shoot a soldier
in the eye...
imagine the advantageous position
they are in
What is this?
Can't see the enemy!
Don't know their position?
Madness!
How far is your platoon?
- Six kilometres away from here, sir
Okay. Let's go.
- Yes, sir
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind
What is the position, Balwan?
Sir, 16 Grenadiers
are in real bad shape
Heavy artillery shelling.
The casualties informed us
Casualties...? Many?
Yes, sir... too many
There's no artillery support
l believe the situation is very bad.
- Yes, sir. lt's very serious
Let's go inside.
- Come in, sir
Let's prepare
for the Tololing attack, sir
Sir, you've got mail
Sir, it's from Ms Kiran.
Read it
Later, Hari Singh
l know what's written
She must've written, our first
wedding anniversary is approaching
Must've enquired if l'm going home
for the wedding anniversary
You tell me, Hari Singh,
what do l reply?
MMG means...
Mandir, Mosque and Gurdwara
Glory to the righteous!
May evil be vanquished!
May there be compassion
May the world have peace
Long live 18 Grenadiers!
No one moves
Sachin, can't see anything
Besides, there's a heavy fog.
What d'you say?
Yes sir, it's too foggy
Yogendra Singh Yadav, what do you say?
Should we go ahead? Or should we
wait for the fog to clear?
Anything you think best, sir.
- We'll slowly move ahead, sir
No, Balwan. We can neither
spot the enemy nor his post
And there's this fog!
l think we should stay back
Sachin, order the company
to be at ease
Company! At ease
Company...
everybody alert!
Take your positions!
Everybody! Take positions!
Sachin, l can't see those bastards.
- l don't see them either
Show up, sisterf''*$@!
Motherf!@''$! Come out!
Motherf!@''$!
- Kill the sisterf!@''$!
Show up, motherf!@''$
Take aim
lf you are man enough, show up!
Motherf!@''$
Shall l move up, Yadav-ji?
- Stay there
Come out you bastard
l still can't see those bastards
l'll have to go further up.
- l'm coming, sir
Give me cover fire.
- Yes, sir
Give Balwan saheb cover fire!
l'm going in.
Give me covering fire
Yadav-ji, can't see those motherf!@$%.
- The motherf!@$% are hiding
Get the stretcher!
Take the casualties down
We'll need eight to ten men
to carry the casualties down
We'll lose our strength !
Understand?
Eight men, go down. Eight men !
Go!
Bastards!
Bravo for Alfa
Come in Alfa
This is Bravo.
- Alfa come in
Get me the C.O immediately.
l want to talk to the C.O
This is Bravo.
We need artillery support, sir
l'm sorry. Fall back
No, sir. l'm in enemy quarters, sir.
l cannot lose ground, sir!
lt is an order.
Come back, Rajesh !
Sorry, sir.
l cannot do that, sir
Rajesh, fall back.
- lf we retract now...
we'll lose more lives in trying
to recapture this land later, sir
Okay.
- Over
We'll take our casualties
down before sunrise
We'll regroup them and
get them tomorrow night, sir
l totally agree with you.
l don't want to lose any more lives
Company take cover.
lt's an order
Take cover
Sachin, l'm going
towards the Barbad bunker
Now you take command..
Come along
Give me cover fire
To Mother lndia...
glory be!
Boys...
before coming to Kargil,
the C.O told us...
that our platoon's slogan is
Victory or Martyrdom!
The time has come
to crush the enemy
The time has come,
to avenge our dead comrades...
to avenge our wounded compatriots
in the hills
Any doubts?
- No, sir
Hail Almighty Lord
Whoever wants to
write to his family...
may write and hand over
the letter to the C.O
You have half an hour
Speak to your wife
lf you consent,
the soldiers first...?
Who wants to talk to his folks
over the satellite phone? Come on
Here... call home, go on
lf l fail to return, you will give
my daughter's hand away in marriage, sir
Shut up, rascal.
You will perform the ritual yourself
lt's the same thing, sir
All l regret is that l couldn't
talk to my wife and children
Talk to your wife
when you come back victorious
Cover me
Come on
Sachin, what is the position?
Sir, Adhikari is over
Oh shit! l knew it
Many of us are wounded, sir
Several dead, sir
How far away is Balwan?
He's 6 to 12 ft away from
Adhikari's body, sir
And he's trying to bring him down, sir
All right, l want to go close to
Adhikari's body. Give me cover fire
lt's too dangerous for you, sir
Look Sachin, it's as dangerous for me
as it is for you
Just relax.
Just give me cover fire, okay?
Come on, move
Give Vishwanathan covering fire
Where's Rajesh Adhikari's body?
A little up ahead...
near his wireless operator, sir
We'll have to retrieve his body.
- Negative, sir
l tried to go there twice, sir.
There's heavy firing from the other side
Bastards!
l don't care, Balwan
Ranbhir Singh, give me cover.
- Yes sir
l want to go to him
- No, sir! Just stay there
Stop, sir
Oh shit!
Balwan, l think l'm hit
l'm... Oh mother... mother...
Where are you hit?
Get the stretcher!
Take him down
No! lt'll require seven-eight men
to take me down
lt'll weaken our battallion's strength.
Listen to me
You get those bastards.
This is the order
Alfa come in
This is Alfa. Pass your message.
- Vishwanathan sir is hit!
Vishwanathan sir is hit!
- Nothing's happened to me, sir
We just want that Tololing, sir
Vishu !
What happened, Vishu?
- Why did you come up, sir?
You shouldn't have taken chances, sir
Vishu, are you alright?
- Sir, l'm fine
Bring the stretcher!
- No sir
Eight men will be engaged, sir.
lt'll weaken our battallion's strength
Please let me talk to Jalaja
l want to talk to my wife.
- Okay
Thank you, sir
Hello... Jalaja?
- Yes, Jalaja here
Talk to Vishu, Jalaja.
- Yeah
Vishu, this is Jalaja here
Talk to me, Vishu
Talk to me, Vishu. Hello
We need artillery support, sir
Colonel Thakur, hold your position
and don't move forward
l don't want anymore casualties
l'm sending you reinforcement
there shortly. Right?
Thank you, sir.
- Over and out
Over and out
Sachin.
- Sir?
Command is also giving us
artillery support
We have lost Vishu and Rajesh
No more casualties.
- Yes, sir
Hold on to your position.
- Okay, sir
No one will fire,
no one will move...
until reinforcement arrives
And especially you, Balwan.
You dig?
Don't move at all. Okay?
So, the boys of 13 Jak Rif are here
At ease, gentlemen
l was expecting you, Colonel
You need no introduction,
you are famous. lt shows
Besides, in the army
the word is that...
lf want to know, just ask Joe
lf you have a question,
ask Joshi
You are embarrassing me, sir
No Joe, no Joshi, sir
Only one name. Tololing.
- We know that, Colonel
National Highway Number One
is our lifeline, sir
And to protect it, it is imperative
to kick the enemy out of Tololing
Unfortunately, they have failed.
That's because, sir,
let give them their dues
they barely had the time to acclimatise,
they had no artillery support
They had no idea
about the enemy's strength
They had no time for
rehearsals either, sir
But your battalion has had enough time
for acclimatisation, sir...
and has received artillery support too
l understand you, Colonel
But whether or not we receive
artillery support...
whether or not we
find time for acclimatisation...
Rajputana Rifles will capture Tololing
And do you know why, Colonel
Because ''Defeat'' and ''Failure''
are words...
that are not in Raj Rif's history.
They're unknown
May it come true, sir
But in case you fail
in your endeavour...
l'm not saying it, sir. These are
the orders from headquarter
Don't worry, Colonel.
Victory and glory will be ours
l'm sure.
One word, sir
Don't misunderstand me
There's a price to be
paid for success, sir
Lives will be lost.
Try and keep the count low
Because, every son of our army,
who gives up his life...
takes with him
some moments of my life
You are a sentimental man, Colonel
That's me, sir. Joe
All the best, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir
Move it boys
What's this? The C.O has put us
on acclimatisation practice
Why not Do or Die?
- Why talk about dying, sir?
Looks like your conversation
with Ms Rajshree over the phone...
wasn't a pleasant one
Yes, l had called her up
She hung up the moment she heard me
By now her trash bin
must be full of letters
Damn it! She takes pains
to heal the sick
But she can't feed my father.
She's not willing to quit the army
Enough, Devendra.
There's no stopping this divorce
No sir. l think you and Ms Rajshree
will make a fresh beginning
Hey Robin ! Bull's eye!
Sir, l'm ready for Tololing.
- Okay, come on. Let's go
Come. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir
Robin, how did you get the name Vijayant?
My father was posted in Pathankot.
l was born there
He was commanding
a brigade of Vijayant tanks
That's how l got the name Vijayant
Hey, don't mind me getting personal.
- Ofcourse not, Tau
How did meet Sheetal?
Sheetal... Tau
l met her in Delhi
and fell in love with her
Love at first sight, eh?
- Sort of
You want to marry her?
- Ofcourse
Have you spoken to her parents?
- Not yet
For my sake, Sheetal will first
win her parents over
And after she has made enough room,
she'll pull me in too
You are a rascal, Robin
Tau, when you call me Robin,
l feel like l'm at home...
with my Ma.
- Did you see her before leaving?
l did and...
almost didn't
Ma, where were you?
The train is about to leave
We went to buy your favourite sweets.
Laddoos and carrot-halwa
Thanks mother.
Thank you very much
Thanks dad
Robin, make me proud.
- Yes dad, l will
God bless you
- Thank you dad
Son, take care of yourself.
- Don't worry about me, Ma
You take care of yourself
The train's leaving.
- God bless you. Take care, Robin
Bye, Robin
Bye.
- Bye mom. Bye dad
l wonder how long they waited there
For a second, l thought...
l had left everything behind
Come on. Let's go
Hey, Robin. Don't get emotional.
lt's part of life, okay?
Okay, Tau
Tau, you grilled me...
but you haven't told me anything
about yourself
Tell me, how did you meet your wife?
- Rascal
Tell me, please
l was coming in a train
from Madras to Hyderabad
She was sitting opposite me.
l saw her;...
she wasn't anything extraordinary.
Just like any other girl
She was knitting a sweater
She glanced at me once...
and that's it
That's it.
She is the one, my heart said
Wonderful! Amazing, Tau
Romance at it's best
Then?
- Then? We married within a year
And soon, we will have a baby
l know. She is pregnant
And every day you write to her
verses from the holy Geeta...
so that she reads it out to the baby
in her womb
But you haven't told me something.
- What?
The magic words.
How did you propose to her?
l like you
ln Hindi? Or in Telugu?
ln Telugu
Come, Colonel Ravindran
The situation is very bad
The troops at present are held
up at this position
The enemy is somewhere here
Our army approached from here...
and we have lost them.
Lots of casualties are there
That leaves this one approach
which is very steep
l think we'll take this approach, sir
What do you say, Acharya?
- That's right, sir.
We have no other choice
You are lucky Ravindran.
You are getting artillery support
l insisted on it, sir.
- So did l
Thank you, sir.
Over and out
So gentlemen, we move on 12th
The artillery guns and
Bofors are in position.
The plan. At 16:45 hours,
That is the time we will attack
C company will be lead by you, Vivek
Code name Cobra.
- Yes, sir
The D company will be lead
by you Mohit
Code name Arjun
And as a command of platoon
will be lead by you Nimo
Code name Bhim.
- Yes, sir
We'll attack from three sides
Rajputana Rifles is ready
to take Tololing
To Lord Rama...
- Glory be!
The Hindustani army is moving ahead.
Fire the artillery
To Lord Rama...
- Glory be!
Sir!
You motherf!@''$%!
Sir!
The swine popped out of nowhere
How could this happen, sir?
- Rajshree wasn't unfaithful
lt is life that betrayed me
To Lord Rama...
- Glory be!
l'm going to retrieve Adhikari's body.
Give me cover fire
Go ahead. We'll be right behind you,
giving you cover
Victory or Martyrdom!
Give me cover fire
To Lord Rama...
- Glory be!
l'm taking that bunker!
Robin, give that cover
Stop, Tau
Don't go any further, Tau.
There's a minefield ahead
Robin, go get that bunker
Destroy the enemy bunkers.
- Tau are you okay?
Charu...
Tau, l...
l destroyed the enemy bunkers
Mother...mother...
Dearest papa, mama, buddy and granny...
By the time you get this letter,
l'll be observing you all from the sky
l have no regrets. lnfact,
even if l become a human again...
l'll join the army and
fight for my nation
lf you can, please come
and see where...
the lndian army fought
for your tomorrow
Best of luck to all.
Yours, Robin
This is Colonel Ravindran.

Congratulations, Colonel Ravi.
Your battalion has done a great job
Thank you, sir. Over

But these men have won Tololing
for us, sir
Colonel Ravi, this is the
turning point of the war
You and your boys have
done a great job
We have paid heavy price
to win Tololing
Over and out.
- Over and out, sir
Boys! Duck!
Get down ! Duck!
Everybody, down !
Somebody get the truck, quick
Hurry up
Get into the trucks, quick!
Set the stretchers down
Move, boys.
Get them into the chopper
