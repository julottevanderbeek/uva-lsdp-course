-
- Come on. Come on. It's all right.
- Wake up, Will.
-
Starboard bow ahoy!
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.
Sounded like a bell.
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.
Mr. Calamy, the lead,
if you please!
-
-
- Sand and broken shell.
- Sand and broken shell.
What is it?
Um...
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.
- What was it? A sail?
- I don't know what it was.
Should we beat
to quarters?
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.
Hollom, you must make
a decision.
We shall beat to quarters!
Move! Move along!
Move along!
-
-
-
-
Good morning, sir.
Sighting in heavy fog.
-
-
- Where away?
- Uh...
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.
-
- You sure, Mr. Hollom?
Yes, sir.
-
- Man-of-war?
I don't know, sir.
It was only for a moment.
Uh, I thought I saw a shape.
- Did you see it, Mr. Calamy?
- No, sir.
Well, you did the right thing,
Mr. Hollom. Go to your stations.
The deck's yours, Tom.
Sir.
-
-
-
-
Haul both
your yard tackles!
Haul both
your yard tackles!
- Down! All hands down!
-
Hands to your stations! Mr. Hollar,
damage report, if you please!
- Eighteen-pounders.
- At least, sir.
We're gonna have to get closer to poke
his eye. Run out the starboard battery.
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Allen, come up on the wind!
-
- Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.
- Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr. Howard.
- Aye, sir.
Sergeant, take your section
into the main top!
We stand tall on the quarterdeck, son.
All of us.
- Mr. Boyle, run up the colors.
- Aye, sir.
-
-
-
-
- Straight at 'em, Mr. Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.
Bill!
Leave the bloody swords!
Get the captain's silver below.
She's not in range yet!
Stand fast till she's close enough!
- Close with him amidships!
-
For God's sake,
don't drop anything!
- Steady!
- Hold your position!
Hold your position!
Courage now!
- Hold steady, boys! Hold steady!
-
Mister Pullings, sir! Davies, Jemmy,
get Mr. Pullings below!
- Mr. Blakeney, pass
the word for the captain.
- Aye!
Clear the forward pin rails!
More sand on the floor!
Down!
Relieving-tackles on the tiller!
You men, collect these wounded!
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr. Calamy.
- Aye, sir.
Reload and give 'em hell!
The rudder's shot away!
The steering don't answer, sir!
We're fish in a barrel.
Why are we not firing?
Let me through.
Hold it in there!
He's on
the larboard bow, sir.
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word!
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.
Put us in that fog, Tom.
- Pull like you're pulling
a Frenchman off your mother!
-
Pull together, men!
Pull for the fog bank!
Run 'em out!
Run 'em out!
Fire!
Joe, a mallet
and some irons!
- We're nearly there, boys!
- Pull!
-
- Pull for the fog!
- Pull for Lucky Jack!
-
Pipe down! Silence on deck!
-
-
-
-
Two feet, six inches, sir,
and holding.
- Good work, Mr. Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.
So, what's
the butcher's bill?
Nine dead, 27 wounded.
Joe Plaice.
I don't think
he'll see out the night.
Lord Blakeney.
Just a broken arm, sir.
Well, you're in
very good hands.
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.
His father would have understood.
He knew the life.
- His mother, however...
- Let me take a look at that brow of yours.
- Oh.
- Hmm?
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.
Hit us with a full broadside, cut across
our tail and took out our rudder.
Damn fine gunnery.
Hmm.
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.
Well, I have no idea precisely
what it is you're talking about...
but he did seem to
come off rather well.
Seven weeks sailing...
and he happens in darkness
on our exact position.
Hmm.
Well, the French have their spies
in England and elsewhere, as do we.
Indeed.
If he knew we were looking for him,
he could have easily stood to sea...
and passed well clear.
Well, then, perhaps
he was looking for us.
It was an unfair match. There was no
dishonor in it. No dishonor at all.
She was more like a ship of the line,
a two-decker, more than a frigate!
You have to wonder about the nature
of her hull. Our shots wouldn't penetrate.
Triple-shotted at 200 yards,
and our guns had no effect.
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.
What is the "weather gauge"?
Shall I show you again,
Stephen?
Not on the cloth.
It means she had
the wind in her favor.
Therefore,
control of the engagement.
The simple fact is
we were soundly beaten.
Heavy frigate like that
in the Pacific...
Could tip the balance of war
in Napoleon's favor.
Surprise
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me
an aged man-of-war, Doctor?
She has a bluff bow,
lovely lines.
She's a fine sea bird...
weatherly, stiff and fast.
Very fast,
if she's well handled.
No, she's not old.
She's in her prime.
The foresail's too far gone,
I'm afraid, so we'll bend our spare.
We're not going home.
But to refit
we need a port...
Acheron
We can refit at sea.
Here, we're at shoals.
As you said, Mr. Allen...
she is taking the war to the South Seas,
and we are supposed to stop her.
But, sir, with respect,
she's a vastly heavier ship.
She's out of our class.
Well, then, there's not
a moment to lose.
Is it true about how they put
the last stitch through your nose?
What do you mean?
Old Joe told me
that when you die...
they stitch you up in your hammock
with the last stitch through your nose...
just to make sure
you're not asleep.
Not through the nose.
You'll tell them?
-
-  It's all right.
It's just
the laudanum speaking.
I've never seen
a braver patient.
- Poor darling.
- Never mind.
We'll soon
have you fixed up.
...
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.
Ask Mr. Lamb
what he has in stock.
Mr. Calamy,
there's something might interest you here.
Look.
The captain carved that...
He says there's enough
of his blood in the woodwork...
for the ship to almost
be a relation.
I do understand
your point, Mr. Allen.
a week spent crawling through
the Brazilian rain forest...
Iooking for a new mast
simply will not do.
The  will be
halfway to China.
Mr. Lamb, as always,
will do his best...
which is all I can hope
to expect from any man.
Sir.
- Is them his brains, Doctor?
-
are his brains.
Physician he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.
He wouldn't look at you
for under 10 guineas on land.
And he knows
his birds and beasts.
You show him a beetle,
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.
-
- You're not a pennyweight
of use gawpin' here!
He still hasn't
said a word, sir.
Sir.
Lord Blakeney.
Feeling better?
Much better.
Thank you, sir.
Well, good.
Good.
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so l...
Thank you, sir.
Did you ever meet
Lord Nelson, sir?
I had the honor and privilege
of serving with him at the Nile.
A great victory.
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135,
if I'm not mistaken.
Yes.
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?
You should read the book.
I will, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, here we go again.
Scrape, scrape, screech, screech.
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.
- Ah.
- How about this?
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?
One, two.
-
-
Hats off.
What's all this about?
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.
- She's Yankee-built, sir.
- See, he was gettin' married there...
and his wife's second cousin,
he works in the yards.
So Will here
saw the ship out of water.
...
So he described it to me,
and I knocked you up a model, sir.
And this framing
is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Killick, an extra ration
of rum for these men.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Which I was savin' for Salutin' Day, I was.
-
Oh, drink wine
on Salutin' Day.
What a fascinating
modern age we live in.
Planking and framing like that would make
her hull, what, two foot thick? Solid oak?
That's why we couldn't dent her. Probably
capable of making 12 to 14 knots.
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.
Even if we did
catch up with her...
I mean, to take her...
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.
- Your name?
-
Gangway for the mail, please.
Here we are.
Very important mail. Letters.
- What's he saying?
-
A large man-of-war,
French...
stopped here on the 10th
and then headed south.
Somewhere here.
A full
three weeks ahead.
Damn.
All right, Tom,
let's get all this squared away.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Hollar!
-
- Let us complete our business here.
Well done.
Gentlemen...
to wives
and to sweethearts.
-  To wives and sweethearts.
- May they never meet.
Mr. Howard.
Mr. Howard, the bottle. The bottle.
- The bottle stands by you.
- Sir.
Sir?
Excuse me, sir,
but Mr. Blakeney said that...
you served under Lord Nelson
at the Nile.
Indeed.
I was a young lieutenant...
not much older
than you are now.
And Mr. Pullings... Mr. Pullings
was a sniveling midshipman...
still yearning
for hearth and home.
-
-
Can you tell me
what he's like?
I have had the honor
of dining with him twice.
He spoke to me
on both occasions.
A master tactician and
a man of singular vision.
Well, he always said
in battle:
"Never mind the maneuvers.
Just go straight at 'em."
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.
He's England's only hope
if Old Bony intends to invade.
Sir, might we press you
for a anecdote?
The first time
that he spoke to me...
I shall never forget
his words.
I remember it
like it was yesterday.
He leaned across the table, he looked me
straight in the eye and he said...
"Aubrey, may I trouble you
for the salt?"
I've always tried
to say it exactly...
as he did ever since.
The s...
The second time...
The second time,
he told me a story...
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.
...
that he was quite warm.
His zeal for king and country
kept him warm.
I know it sounds absurd, and were it
from another man you'd cry out...
"Oh, what pitiful stuff,"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.
But with Nelson...
you felt your heart glow.
Wouldn't you say,
Mr. Pullings?
You did indeed, sir.
Well, then, he would seem to be the
exception to the rule that authority corrupts.
-
- To Lord Nelson.
To Lord Nelson.
Do you see
those two weevils, Doctor?
I do.
Neither. There's not a scrap
of difference between them.
They're the same species
of curculio.
If you  to choose...
if you were forced
to make a choice...
if there was
no other response but to...
Well, then, if you're going to push me.
There! I have you!
You're completely dished.
Do you not know
that in the service...
one must always choose
the lesser of two weevils?
He who would pun
would pick a pocket.
Really. "Weevils."
To the lesser
of two weevils.
To the lesser of two weevils!
-
-
- Whoo!
-
The Lord taketh...
and the Lord
giveth away.
You hear that?
He said something.
Well done indeed, Stephen.
# Farewell and adieu
to you Spanish ladies #
# Farewell and adieu
to ladies of Spain #
# For we've received orders
to sail for Old England #
#We hope in a short time #
Indeed.
# Come, all you bold
young thoughtless men #
#A warning take by me #
#And never leave
your happy homes #
#To sail the raging sea #
# Come, all you bold
young thoughtless men #
He must've been watching us
from some inlet and waited till we passed.
- He has us by the hip.
- Run like smoke and oakum.
- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our pocket
handkerchiefs if we have to!
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it.
- Mr. Allen, gentlemen.
- Aye, sir.
This is the second time he's done this
to me. There will not be a third.
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.
You better hold fast.
What is it with this man?
Did I kill a relative
of his in battle perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?
He fights like you, Jack.
Bring the sun down
to the horizon.
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant!
When the orb
is no longer rising...
then it has reached
its zenith.
- And that would be noon.
- Sir?
Mr. Pullings.
Do you make noon, Mr. Hollom?
- Yes, sir.
- Call noon. It's your class.
-
- Six hours?
Five at most.
Just keep us out of
her reach until nightfall.
We didn't want to make it any taller, sir,
on account of this wind.
Excuse me, sir,
but what are they building?
Your first command.
Lower away on the main!
- I wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.
There's a painter, bo. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.
-
-
Now.
Killick, there!
Douse your light!
- Mr. Allen, make ready.
-
Hello.
We caught a fish!
-
-
- Now tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.
Hard a'larboard!
Stand the men down,
Mr. Pullings.
- I'll take this watch.
-
Aye, sir. Mr. Mowett, Mr. Allen,
calmly now.
- You know his orders.
- Well done, sir.
The way she come up again,
right behind us like that.
Like that first time
out of the fog...
with our shot
bouncin' off her.
Captain's not called
Lucky Jack for no reason.
Phantom or no,
she's a privateer...
and Lucky Jack'll have her.
You need more than luck
against a phantom.
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.
Oh, no.
If they were...
we could hang them
when we catch 'em.
They go after rich merchantmen
and the like.
Hey, but think on our share
of the prize money.
and ambergris
and all the gems of Araby.
But I never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.
- And I've never met a live one
you've bought one for neither.
-
That's the last of the coffee too.
Thank you, Killick.
Bonden?
That's enough easting.
Set a course south-southwest.
Aye, sir.
South-southwest.
-
- I told you.
-
- Foul! Foul!
You got away before me!
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.
- Have the idlers placed along the rails.
- Yes, sir.
In all my years,
I've never seen the like.
It has to be more than 100 sea miles,
and he brings us up on his tail.
That's seamanship, Mr. Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.
-
-
- We'll have them by nightfall, I think.
- I think we've got him, sir.
Now, don't count your eggs before
they're in the pudding, Mr. Calamy.
she may well be ours.
Touch wood.
Scratch a stay.
Turn three times!
May the lords and saints
preserve us!
Turn!
Move along, man! Move along!
We'll have lost him before you rig it up!
Hold!
Twelve knots, sir!
That's 12 knots?
That's good.
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.
- Mr. Hollar!
- Aye, sir.
Rouse up the off watch.
All hands on
starboard rail!
-
-
